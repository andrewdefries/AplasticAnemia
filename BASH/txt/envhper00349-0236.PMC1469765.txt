Benzene is a recognized hematotoxin and leukemogen, but its mechanisms of action in humans
are still uncertain. To provide insight into these processes, we carried out a cross-sectional study
of 44 healthy workers currently exposed to benzene (median 8-hr time-weighted average; 31
ppm), and unexposed controls in Shanghai, China. Here we provide an overview of the study
results on peripheral blood cell levels and somatic cell mutation frequency measured by the
glycophorin A (GPA) gene loss assay and report on peripheral cytokine levels. All peripheral blood
cell levels (i.e., total white blood cells, absolute lymphocyte count, platelets, red blood cells, and
hemoglobin) were decreased among exposed workers compared to controls, with the exception
of the red blood cell mean corpuscular volume, which was higher among exposed subjects. In
contrast, peripheral cytokine levels (interleukin-3, interleukin-6, erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor, tissue necrosis factor-a) in a subset of the most highly exposed workers
(n= 11) were similar to values in controls (n= 11), suggesting that benzene does not affect these
growth factor levels in peripheral blood. The GPA assay measures stem cell or precursor
erythroid cell mutations expressed in peripheral red blood cells of MN heterozygous subjects,
identifying NN variants, which result from loss of the GPA M allele and duplication of the N allele,
and No variants, which arise from gene inactivation. The NN (but not NO) GPA variant cell
frequency was elevated in the exposed workers compared with controls (mean ± SD, 13.9 ± 8.4
mutants per million cells versus 7.4 ± 5.2 per million cells, respectively; p=0.0002), suggesting
that benzene produces gene-duplicating but not gene-inactivating mutations at the GPA locus in
bone marrow cells of exposed humans. These findings, combined with ongoing analyses of
benzene macromolecular adducts and chromosomal aberrations, will provide an opportunity to
comprehensively evaluate a wide range of early biologic effects associated with benzene
exposure in humans. - Environ Health Perspect 104(Suppl 6):1365-1370 (1996)

Introduction
Occupational exposure to benzene has been
associated with hematotoxicity, leukemia,
and other related blood disorders (1-5).
Studies in animals and cell culture have
produced a large amount of information on
the potential mechanism of benzene toxic-
ity, but the extrapolation of these data to
humans requires further study. To provide
insight into benzene's biologic effects in
humans, we performed a cross-sectional
study of 44 healthy workers exposed to a
wide range of benzene levels and 44 unex-
posed controls in Shanghai, China, as part
of a large research effort to evaluate ben-
zene-related effects in a retrospective cohort
study of 74,828 workers exposed to ben-
zene in 12 Chinese cities (4,5). Some ofthe
questions being addressed by this study are
as follows:
a) What is the nature of benzene
metabolites found at different levels of
exposure, i.e., are proportionally more
toxic benzene metabolites formed at
higher or lower exposure levels?
b) What is the impact ofinterindividual
variation in cytochrome P4502E1
(CYP2E1) activity on the formation of
benzene metabolites and subsequent
effects?
c) What is the pattern of hematotoxic
effects?
d) Since certain cytokines are involved
in regulating hematopoiesis, does ben-
zene exposure alter cytokine levels in
peripheral blood?
e) Does benzene form DNA adducts in
peripheral white blood cells?
f) Does benzene nonspecifically cause
chromosome aberrations in peripheral
lymphocytes, or are there selective cate-
gories of aberrations formed or only
particular chromosomes affected?
g) Does benzene induce gene mutations
in human bone marrow, and, if so,
what is the nature ofthese mutations?

collected on this study population, which
include measures of historical and current
benzene air levels, and biomarkers of

Methods
Subject Enrollment
Details of the study population have been
reported previously (6). Workplaces were
identified from public health district
records and from exposure and demo-
graphic data previously collected for the
cohort study (4,5). Three exposed factories
were selected so that the study population
would have a wide range of exposure to
benzene [1 to .25 ppm as an 8-hr time-
weighted average (TWA), similar to that
found among workers in the cohort study].
One factory used benzene to solubilize
natural rubber for subsequent production
of rubber padding for printing presses, one
factory used benzene to manufacture adhe-
sive tape, and one factory applied benzene-
based paint and varnish to wooden toys
and boxes. Two workplaces in the same
geographic area that did not use benzene or
other chemicals associated with bone mar-
row toxicity were selected as control facto-
ries: one manufactured sewing machines
and the other was an administrative facil-
ity. Controls were frequency-matched on
age (5-year intervals) and gender to work-
ers currently exposed to benzene. Exclusion
criteria for all subjects included prior his-
tory of cancer, therapeutic radiation,
chemotherapy, or current pregnancy.
Ninety-four percent of eligible subjects
selected for study were enrolled.
Exposure Assessment
Exposure was estimated using a modifica-
tion of the method used for the cohort
study (7). This estimate incorporated work
histories obtained by interview and review
ofworkplace employment records, benzene
area measurements obtained from factory
records, and information on annual amount
of benzene used, percent benzene used in
workplace solvents, and changes in manufac-
turing, ventilation, and personal protective
equipment use. Cumulative exposure to ben-
zene was calculated from the historical time-
specific exposure estimates and the duration
worked. Exposure was assessed blinded with
respect to all outcome measures.
Current exposure to benzene was moni-
tored by organic vapor passive dosimetry
badges (3M, St. Paul, MN). These badges
were worn by each worker in an exposed
factory for a full workshift on 5 separate
days during 1 to 2 weeks before phle-
botomy. The majority of subjects in the
factory that manufactured sewing machines
were monitored for one shift; subjects in
the administrative facility were not moni-
tored. Badges were analyzed by gas chro-
matography with flame ionization detection
for benzene, toluene, and xylene. Forty-three
of 44 benzene-exposed workers provided a
spot urine sample at the end ofa work shift
or at the end of the high-exposure period
during their work shift.

Interview and Biologic
Sample Collection
Study subjects were evaluated at the
Shanghai Hygiene and Anti-Epidemic
Center. They were asked to refrain from
eating solid foods after dinner the night
before and the morning of the clinical
phase of the study. On the day of study,
the protocol was explained to all potential
participants, and informed consent was
obtained using Institutional Review Board-
approved procedures. Height and weight of
each subject were measured.
Subjects provided a baseline urine sam-
ple and then received 250 mg chlorzoxa-
zone to evaluate CYP2E1 function (8,9)
(results to be reported elsewhere). Subjects
drank only noncaffeinated soft drinks for
the first 2.5 hr, after which they ate a light
lunch. Complete urine collections were
carried out over the next 8 hr. A 27-ml vol-
ume of blood was obtained, and several
peripheral smears were made for each sub-
ject. Portions of each blood sample were
inoculated as whole-blood cultures, har-
vested, and processed into slides for analysis
of interphase and metaphase chromosome
aberrations and micronuclei. A separate
portion was stabilized with ascorbic acid for
eventual folate analysis. A third portion was
fractionated into plasma, white blood cells,
and red blood cells.
Each subject was administered a ques-
tionnaire by a trained interviewer from the
staff of the Shanghai Hygiene and Anti-
Epidemic Center's Department of Occupa-
tional Health. Data collected included age,
gender, current and lifelong tobacco use,
alcohol consumption, medical history,
occupational work history, and the number
of days in the previous week that subjects
experienced symptoms associated with
solvent neurotoxicity.
LaboratoryAnalysis
Benzene urinary metabolites were mea-
sured using a modification of a previously
reported isotope dilution gas chroma-
tography-mass spectroscopy assay (10).
13C-labeled analogues of trans-trans-
muconic acid (muconic acid) and phenol,
catechol and hydroquinone as sulfate and
glucuronide conjugates were used as
internal standards.
Peripheral blood samples were analyzed
by a Coulter T540 blood counter. Five
hematologic measurements are presented
here; the total white blood cell count
(WBC) (x 103/pl blood), the absolute lym-
phocyte count (x 103/pl blood), hemoglo-
bin value (g/dl), the red blood cell count
Environmental Health Perspectives * Vol 104, Supplement 6 * December 19961366
EARLY BIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF BENZENE EXPOSURE
(RBC) (x 106/pl blood), and the platelet
count (x 103/pl blood). The mean corpus-
cular volume (MCV; pm3) was calculated
as the hematocrit/(RBC x 10).
Cytokine measurements were priori-
tized on the basis of alterations previously
detected in patients with the myelodys-
plastic syndrome (11-13). Plasma levels of
granulocyte colony stimulating factor
(G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor both tend to be
elevated in patients with aplastic anemia
(13). Therefore, because of the limited
volume of plasma available, we chose to
measure G-CSF alone. Plasma levels of
cytokines were determined by enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions. Interleukin (IL)-3, G-CSF, IL-6, and
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) ELISA
kits were purchased from R & D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN) and the erythropoietin
ELISA kit was obtained from Genzyme
(Cambridge, MA). The ELISA plates were
read and cytokine concentrations calcu-
lated from the standard curves using a
Dynatech MR 5000 plate reader.
Analysis of peripheral RBCs for the
glycophorin A gene loss assay has been
described (14). In brief, spherical, forma-
lin-fixed erythrocytes were prepared in
duplicate from MN individuals and from
MM and NN controls as described (15).
The BR6 assay of Langlois et al. (15) was
used with slight modification for enumer-
ating No and NN variants. Data are
reported as the NN or No variant cell fre-
quency (Vf), defined as the number of
mutant cells per million counted.
Statistical Analysis
Summary data are reported as mean (SD)
or as median (range). Group differences for
benzene metabolites, peripheral blood
counts, and continuous cytokine values
were tested by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test,
and group differences for categorical cyto-
kine outcomes were tested by Fisher's exact
test. Spearman rank order correlation was
used to test associations between benzene
exposure and each outcome
The GPA NN and No Vf data were
normalized with a logarithmic transforma-
tion, and group differences were tested by
Student's t-test. A dose-response relation-
ship between GPA Vf values and cumula-
tive benzene exposure was tested by multiple
linear regression, with subjects within each
exposure category (0, 1-100, 101-500, and
>500 ppm-years) assigned the median
exposure for that category. Age, gender,
current and lifetime tobacco use, alcohol
consumption, diagnostic X-ray exposure,
and body mass index (BMI), a measure of
obesity calculated as weight/height2, were
tested for potential confounding. Two-
tailed p-values <0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
Demographics and Exposure
Assessment
Demographic characteristics ofthe 44 work-
ers currently exposed to benzene and con-
trols were similar, including age, gender,
current smoking and alcohol consumption,
and BMI (Table 2). The mean (SD) of
occupational exposure to benzene among
the exposed subjects was 6.3 (4.4) years.
These subjects were currently exposed to a
wide range of benzene levels (median: 31
ppm as an 8-hr TWA, range: 1-328 ppm).
The mean muconic acid urine level was
33.0 (28.0) pg/mg creatinine in the exposed
workers (n= 43) and 0.3 (0.2) rig/mg creati-
nine in a subsample of controls tested
(n= 17, p< 0.0001). Phenol, hydroquinone,
and catechol urine levels were similarly ele-
vated in exposed workers compared to con-
trols (data not shown). Further, as we have
previously reported (6), the proportion of
benzene metabolites excreted as muconic
acid and hydroquinone decreased from a
median of 32% in workers exposed to <31
ppm benzene to 24% in workers exposed to
>31 ppm (p= 0.006).
Hematotoxicity
Workers currently exposed to benzene had
lower total WBC, absolute lymphocyte,
platelet, and RBC counts than controls
(Table 3). Among all peripheral blood
counts, the most significant difference
between exposed subjects and controls was
observed for the absolute lymphocyte count.
Compared to controls, hemoglobin values
of exposed workers were nonsignificantly
decreased, and the MCV was significantly

workers, total urine benzene metabolite lev-
els were significantly correlated only with
the absolute lymphocyte count (r= -0.32,
p= 0.04) and the MCV (r= 0.37, p= 0.01).
In contrast, there were no significant corre-
lations between cumulative benzene expo-
sure and peripheral blood cell counts (data
not shown).
Peripheral Cytokine Levels
A subsample of the most highly exposed
quartile ofcurrently exposed workers (n= 11,
8-hr TWA >55.0 ppm) and controls (n= 11)
was selected to determine if peripheral
cytokine values were associated with benzene
exposure. Levels ofIL-6, erythropoietin, and
TNF-a were similar in exposed subjects and
controls (Table 4). Levels ofG-CSF and IL-
3 were nondetectable in almost all subjects.
Neither benzene urinary metabolites nor
cumulative benzene exposure was associated
with any cytokine level (data not shown).

habits, and BMI were similar in both
groups. As we have previously reported
(14), the NN Vf was about twice as high
among the benzene-exposed workers com-
pared to controls (13.9 ± 8.4 mutants per
million cells versus 7.4 ± 5.2 mutants per
million cells, p= 0.0002). In contrast, there
was not a significant difference between the
two groups for the No Vf (9.1± 4.2
mutants versus 8.8 ± 8.7 mutants per mil-
lion, p= 0.21). There was a highly signifi-
cant association between lifetime cumulative
benzene exposure and NN Vf (p= 0.005,
Table 5), which was minimally changed
after adjustment for potential confounders.
In contrast, the NO Vf was not associated
with cumulative benzene exposure (p= 0.31,
Table 5). Total benzene urinary metabolites
were not significantly correlated with either
the NN Vf (r= 0.02, p= 0.94) or No Vf
(r= 0.35, p= 0.10).
Discussion
We conducted this study to evaluate early
biologic effects associated with benzene
exposure. Forty-four subjects currently
exposed to a wide range of benzene and
44 controls were studied in 1992 in
Shanghai, China. Past patterns of exposure
to benzene were estimated and current pat-
terns of exposure were measured for all
subjects, demographic data were collected,
and blood samples were obtained and
extensively processed in a manner appro-
priate for the analysis of a broad range
ofbiomarkers.
Urinary levels of benzene metabolite
were substantially higher among the
exposed population than among controls.
In addition, a larger proportion of benzene
urinary metabolites were present as muconic
acid and hydroquinone at lower (< 31 ppm)
versus higher (.31 ppm) levels of expo-
sure, similar to reports in animal studies
(16). This is particularly noteworthy
because muconic acid and hydroquinone
are correlated with benzene metabolites
that have particularly potent genotoxic and
myelotoxic effects (17-22).
The WBC, absolute lymphocyte, and
platelet counts were significantly lower in
benzene-exposed workers compared to
controls; of these, the absolute lymphocyte
count was the most significantly reduced in
the exposed workers (27% lower compared
to controls, p< 0.001). Hemoglobin values
were nonsignificantly depressed, and the
MCV was significantly elevated. These
findings are consistent with most previous
reports of benzene hematotoxicity [reviewed
by Goldstein (23,24) and Aksoy (3)]. An
early report of Goldwater (25) demon-
strated that the absolute lymphocyte count
is particularly sensitive to benzene expo-
sure, and studies have shown similar find-
ings in animals exposed to as little as 10
ppm benzene (26). Total benzene urinary
metabolites were significantly correlated
with the absolute lymphocyte count and
the MCV, while cumulative benzene expo-
sure was not associated with any peripheral
blood cell, suggesting that benzene-associ-
ated hematotoxicity reflects only relatively
recent exposure.
The regulation of hematopoiesis is a
dynamic process in which stem and prog-
enitor cells, in conjunction with bone mar-
row stroma, give rise to a large number of
mature blood cells. The survival and prolif-
eration of stem and progenitor cells are
controlled by multiple growth factors, or
cytokines, with overlapping functions that
act individually or in combination to regu-
late hematopoiesis. A series of studies car-
ried out in mice and in human bone
marrow cultures have shown that benzene
alters cytokine production or response to
cytokines in the bone marrow (27-35). To
determine if benzene exposure affects
cytokine levels measured in peripheral
blood, a more accessible and acceptable
tissue source than bone marrow, we evalu-
ated a panel of cytokines in the most
heavily exposed workers and a subset of

controls. Cytokine levels were similar in
the two groups.
Previous studies have shown that
G-CSF, IL-6, erythropoietin, and TNF-ax
are elevated in patients with myelodysplas-
tic syndromes (11-13). It is unclear if these
markers have contributed to the disease state
itself or reflect a feedback loop in response
to altered blood counts. Our data suggest,
within the limitations of the small sample
size, that benzene exposure did not affect
peripheral blood cytokine values, even if
alterations in these growth factors occurred
in the bone marrow. Further, if peripheral
cytokine levels reflect only a hemostatic
response to altered blood cell levels, the mild
hematotoxicity present in the exposed
workers may not have been severe enough
to elicit this effect.
We measured GPA mutation frequency
in peripheral RBCs from 24 workers
exposed to benzene and in 23 unexposed
controls. Since mature red blood cells lack a
nucleus, mutations expressed in red blood
cells must have occurred exclusively in pre-
cursor erythroid cells or stem cells in the
bone marrow. The frequency of NN but
not No mutants increased progressively
with rising lifetime cumulative benzene
exposure, suggesting that benzene causes
repeated damage to longer-lived stem cells
in human bone marrow. Since these stem
cells are considered pluripotent, our find-
ing has potential relevance for understand-
ing the mechanism of DNA damage
responsible for benzene-associated leu-
kemia. NN variants could arise from
mitotic recombination, gene conversion, or
chromosome loss with reduplication. The
most likely cause of gene-duplicating
mutations measured in somatic cell muta-
tion assays is mitotic recombination (36),
which recent studies suggest plays an

important role in the development of
leukemias and lymphomas (37,38).
We continue to analyze data collected
from this study population to gain addi-
tional insight into the biologic effects of
benzene exposure in humans (Table 1).
For example, we report in the current
volume that benzene exposure was associ-
ated with hyperdiploidy of chromosome 9
measured by fluorescent in situ hybridiza-
tion in interphase lymphocytes (39), which
was inversely correlated with the absolute
lymphocyte count. This provides evidence
ofa link between hematotoxicity and aneu-
ploidy in exposed humans and is consistent
with previous reports that benzene poison-
ing (i.e., hematotoxicity) is associated with
a high risk of subsequently developing
leukemia (40,41).
In addition, we are currently analyzing
similar data collected from a group of
50 subjects with a history of benzene
poisoning (most of whom were no longer
exposed to benzene) and controls. This
work will provide an opportunity to exam-
ine the persistence of benzene-associated
hematotoxicity, somatic cell mutations, and
chromosome aberrations, and to evaluate
susceptibility factors for these events.
Finally, we note that individual benzene
air levels in these factories were much
higher than expected based on historical
area monitoring data. As a result of data
collected for this study, remedial action
was taken at the workplaces with the high-
est benzene exposures, which included
substitution of toluene for benzene,
improvement in ventilation, and enclosure
ofreaction vessels.
