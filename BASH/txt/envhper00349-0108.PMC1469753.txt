A goal of our research is to identify biochemical factors that underlie the susceptibility of bone
marrow cell populations to benzene metabolites so as to develop a mechanistically based
chemoprotective strategy that may be used in susceptible humans exposed to benzene. By
doing biochemical risk analysis of bone marrow stromal cells from mice and rats and the human
myeloid cell lines, HL-60 and ML-1; and by using buthionine sulfoximine and dicumarol we have
observed that the susceptibility of these cell populations to hydroquinone (HQ) correlates with
their concentration of glutathione (GSH) and activity of quinone reductase (QR). Accordingly, the
induction of QR and GSH by 1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T) in these cell populations has resulted in a
significant protection against the following hydroquinone-mediated toxicities: inhibition of cell
proliferation and viability; reduced ability of stromal cells to support myelopoiesis; and altered
differentiation of ML-1 cells to monocytes/macrophages. Preliminary in vivo experiments indicate
that feeding mice D3T results in an induction of QR in the bone marrow compartment such that
stromal cells are more resistant to hydroquinone-induced cytotoxicity in vitro. Overall, these
studies suggest that in addition to hepatic cytochrome P4502E1, bone marrow OR and GSH are
factors that could determine an individual's relative susceptibility to the toxic effects of benzene.

Introduction
Although physicians have been aware of
hematotoxicity resulting from benzene expo-
sure for nearly a century (1), there is still
concern for human health due to continued
benzene exposure in certain occupational
settings and as a result of cigarette smoking
(2). One of the goals of toxicology as a sci-
ence is to develop preventive interventions
against chemical-induced disease. The
development of rational chemoprotective
strategies can result from an understanding
of the underlying mechanisms involved in
the induction of disease by a particular
chemical (Figure 1). Such mechanistically
based chemoprotective interventions can
then be utilized in populations that cannot
avoid exposure to a chemical or in exposed
individuals within a population who may
be inherently susceptible to even low
concentrations of a chemical. The present

studies in China examining oltipraz as a
chemoprotective agent against aflatoxin-
induced hepatocarcinogenesis are an example
ofthis approach (3).
As early as the 1920s occupational
health physicians recognized that there are
individual differences in susceptibility to
benzene-induced hematotoxicity (1,4). As
with many chemicals, it is now appreciated
that the susceptibility to benzene is deter-
mined in part by the activity of enzymes
involved in its biotransformation, as well as
by factors involved in the detoxification of
benzene-derived reactive intermediates.
Although human exposure to benzene
occurs primarily through inhalation, bio-
transformation reactions in the liver result
in phase I and phase II metabolites (5).
Subsequent bioactivation of some of these
liver-derived metabolites within the various
bone marrow cell populations results in
altered bone marrow function leading to
the manifestations of benzene-induced
hematotoxicity: aplastic anemia; leukemia;
and immunotoxicity (2). In the liver,
the metabolism of benzene to the phase I
metabolites, phenol, and hydroquinone
(HQ), is catalyzed by cytochrome P4502E1
(CYP2E1) (6). Since phenol and HQ can
be further converted to reactive intermedi-
ates, the activity ofCYP2E1 in the liver can
be viewed as a factor that contributes to
individual susceptibility (7). Likewise,
within the bone marrow there are factors
that probably determine the susceptibility
ofthe various bone marrow cell populations
to toxic reactions by benzene-derived
metabolites. For example, the bioreactivity
of benzoquinone, an electrophilic metabo-
lite of HQ, can be modulated by the
actions of quinone reductase (QR) or glu-
tathione (GSH) (Figure 2). The purpose of
this report is to illustrate why QR and GSH
should be considered determinants of
HQ-induced toxicity to bone marrow cells
and to demonstrate that the induction of
QR and GSH may serve as a basis for the
development of a chemoprotective strategy
against benzene-induced hematoxicities.
Determinants of Toxicity to
Bone Marrow Cell Populations
Within the bone marrow are a number of
cell populations that can serve as potential
targets of environmental chemicals or
drugs (Figure 3). These include the hemo-
poietic and lymphopoietic stem cells, com-
mitted progenitors, immature hemopoietic
precursors, mature functional blood cells,

and the various cells that comprise the
bone marrow stromal microenvironment
(8). As shown in Figure 3, the altered
function of different populations probably
results in the manifestation of different
types of toxicities. For example, inhibition
of the ability of stromal macrophages to
synthesize interleukin-1 (IL-1) results in
the altered differentiation of myeloid and
lymphoid cells involved in host defense
and immune response (9,10). On the
other hand, chemical-induced lethality to
both stromal macrophages and fibroblasts
could result in such an absence of cyto-
kines and growth factors in the bone
marrow that committed and immature
hemopoietic progenitors would die from
apoptosis (11), resulting in an aplastic
state. Recent studies with radiation-induced
bone marrow toxicity have emphasized the
significance of alterations of the stromal
microenvironment in the development of
aplastic anemia (12). Similarly, an altered
stromal microenvironment has been linked
with the development ofleukemia (11).
The difference in response of stromal
macrophage and fibroblasts to toxicants
could be a reflection of the concentration
of the chemical (13) or the mechanism of
toxicity involved (14). In this regard,

stromal macrophages are more susceptible
to the toxic effects oflow concentrations of
HQ than are stromal fiobroblasts (10).
However, as the concentration of HQ is
increased, stromal fibroblasts also succumb
to the cytotoxic effects. The basis for this
difference in susceptibility to HQ between
stromal macrophages and fibroblasts can be
attributed in part to macrophages having
lower QR activity than stromal fibroblasts
(13,15) and to macrophages exhibiting a
peroxide dependent mechanism capable of
activating HQ to a covalent binding
species, presumably benzoquinone (15).
HQ can be oxidized to benzoquinone by

myeloperoxidase (16), prostaglandin
synthase (17), superoxide dismutase (18)
and copper (19). Reflective of the cellular
conversion of HQ to benzoquinone is the
depletion of cellular GSH, which precedes
cell toxicity and death (20). Since cellular
GSH is a factor that modulates the molec-
ular interactions of benzoquinone (Figure
2), it is a determinant of susceptibility to
HQ. As illustrated in Figure 4, differences
in stromal cell QR and GSH are reflected
in the susceptibility of stromal cells from
mice and rats to HQ (21). In vivo studies
have shown DBA/2 mice to be more sensi-
tive to benzene-induced hematotoxicity
than C57BL/6 mice (22) and mice in gen-
eral are considered more sensitive than rats
(23). In this regard, the pattern of benzene
metabolism in rats is different from that in
mice (24). Rats produce a fewer number as
well as a smaller amount of metabolites
that contribute to toxic reactions. The data
presented in Figure 4 also indicate that
the bone marrow stromal cells of rats are
inherently more resistant to both HQ and
benzoquinone than those from mice (21).
The overall function of the bone
marrow is to provide blood and immune
cells to the body. This function is accom-
plished through the differentiation of
committed progenitor and precursor cells.

SUSCEPTIBILITY AND CHEMOPROTECTION TO BENZENE
Figure 4. Comparison of the quinone reductase activity, the glutathione content, and the hydroquinone concentra-
tion cytotoxic to 50% (LC50) of bone marrow stromal cells from DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice and Sprague-Dawley
rats. Data are summarized from data presented in Twerdok et al. (13) and Zhu et al. (21).
Our understanding of the biochemical and
molecular processes involved in the differen-
tiation of myeloid cells has been advanced
through the utilization human leukemic cell
lines such as HL-60 and ML-1 cells (25).
In vitro, these two myeloid cell lines con-
tinuously proliferate in suspension culture;
however, upon addition of 12-O-tetrade-
canoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D3, they differentiate
into monocytes/macrophages. Conversely,
DMSO or retinoic acid induce their differ-
entiation into polymorphonuclear cells.
Recently, these myeloid cell lines have been
utilized in toxicological studies (26-28).
The data presented in Table 1 show that
HL-60 cells have more GSH than ML-1
cells. On the other hand, the HL-60 cells
are relatively QR deficient. When chal-
lenged in vitro with HQ, the HL-60 cells
are more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of
HQ than are the ML-1 cells. GSH deple-
tion occurs at a significantly faster rate in
the ML-1 cells than in the HL-60 cells,
although HL-60 cells have higher myelo-
peroxidase activity than ML-1 cells (29).
On the other hand, ML-1 cells are larger

and have more protein that could serve as
nonspecific targets for benzoquinone.
We have also compared the response to
HQ of undifferentiated and TPA-differenti-
ated ML-1 cells (30). In this model, 0.3
ng/ml of TPA is added to 3 x 105 cells/ml
seeded in fetal bovine serum (FBS)-coated
flasks (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and cultured
in RPMI 1640 media (GIBCO, Grand
Island, NY) containing 7.5% FBS. After 3
days, the TPA is washed out, fresh media
added, and differentiation allowed to con-
tinue for an additional 3 days. As presented
in Table 2, the TPA-differentiated cells have
significantly more GSH and QR activity.
Concomitantly, the TPA-differentiated cells
are less susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of
HQ than the undifferentiated cells.
The above results with bone marrow
stromal cells and the HL-60 and ML-1
cells are consistent with the concept that
GSH and QR are biochemical determinants
of cellular toxicity to HQ. Accordingly, we
have chemically modulated QR and GSH
through the actions of dicumoral and
buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), respectively
(13,20,21,29,30). As shown in Table 3, in
Table 2. Comparison of cellular GSH content, OR
activity, and HQ LC50 between undifferentiated and

stromal cells derived from both DBA/2
mice and Sprague-Dawley rats, the inhibi-
tion of QR by dicumoral enhanced the
toxic effects of HQ. Similarly, dicumoral
enhanced the toxicity of HQ to TPA-dif-
ferentiated ML-1 cells but not the undif-
ferentiated cells, although QR activity was
inhibited by dicumoral in the undifferenti-
ated cells (29). Thus, in undifferentiated
myeloid cell intermediates, and possibly
even in stem cell and progenitor cell popula-
tions, GSH may be the major defense
against benzoquinone, although QR enzyme
activity is measurable. QR can utilize either
NADPH or NADH as co-factors; however,
the activity of QR may be limited by the
availability of such co-factors due to the
inability of undifferentiated cells to synthe-
size sufficient quantities of these pyridine
dinucleotides. One of the major biochemi-
cal differences between undifferentiated
and TPA-differentiated ML-1 cells is the
relative absence ofmitochondrial respiration
in the undifferentiated cells (31). Further
studies are needed to better understand
the biochemistry of these undifferentiated
cells with regard to matters relevant to
mechanisms ofchemical-induced toxicity.
The inhibition of GSH synthesis by
BSO results in the cellular depletion of
GSH and a potentiation of HQ-induced
toxicity to DBA/2-derived stromal cells
(20) and undifferentiated HL-60 and ML-
1 cells (29). Although GSH content was
significantly decreased by BSO in Sprague-
Dawley-derived stromal cells and TPA-
differentiated ML-1 cells, there was no
potentiation of HQ-induced toxicity in
these cells (21,30). Treatment with BSO
resulted in a significant induction in QR
activity in the rat stromal cells and the
TPA-differentiated ML- 1 cells. Shertzer
et al. (32) recently reported a similar effect
of BSO in mouse Hepa-lclc7 cells.
Overall, the data presented in Table 3 are
consistent with the concept that QR and

Chemoprotection against
Chemical-induced Disease
Owrview
Over the last decade, a greater emphasis has
been put on preventing human disease
development. This has resulted in the devel-
opment of molecular interventions that
either prevent the initial induction ofdisease
or intervene in the progression ofdisease. In
environmental health, this concept has its
origins in studies on the chemoprotection
against cancer. Chemoprotection is defined
as the protection from the toxicity of one
chemical by the administration of another
chemical. This phenomenon can be traced
to observations made by Berenblum about
the skin more than 60 years ago (33). Since
that time, a plethora ofstructurally unrelated
compounds, including phenolic antioxi-
dants, coumarins, azo dyes, flavonoids,
dithiothiones, and isothiocyanates have been
demonstrated to protect laboratory animals
against the carcinogenic or toxic effects of
environmental chemicals (34,35).
Mechanistically, the chemoprotective
actions of many of the above classes of
chemicals lie in their ability to induce the
synthesis of enzymes involved in phase II
reactions as well as glutathione (36).
Accordingly, induction of these enzymes
alters conditions responsible for target
organ toxicity by shifting xenobiotic
metabolism, either in the liver or in the tar-
get organ, away from the generation of
reactive intermediates or toward detoxifica-
tion. In this regard, Talalay and co-workers
have classified chemicals as being bifunc-
tional or monofunctional inducers (37),
with monofunctional inducers being those
that elevate primarily phase II enzymes as
well as glutathione and quinone reductase
without significantly inducing phase I
enzymes such as the cytochrome P450s.
Many of the monofunctional inducers also
elicit the induction of protective systems
without interacting with the Ah receptor,
which is a characteristic not shared by many
of the bifunctional inducers. The applica-
tion of chemoprotective strategies to tar-
geted human populations has been further
realized as a result of the development of
molecular biomarkers and the incorporation
of these biomarkers into epidemiologic
studies (38). As mentioned previously, an
excellent example of the development of a
mechanistically based chemoprotective
strategy is the studies in animal models that
utilize oltipraz, a dithiothione, as the chemo-
protective agent and several biomarkers for
aflatoxin (39).
Chemoprotection ofthe
Bone Marrow
Although the liver, lung, and skin are often
the target organs examined in chemoprotec-
tive studies, several studies suggest that a
chemoprotective strategy is applicable to the
bone marrow. For example, Huggins et al.
(40,41) demonstrated that azo dyes prevent
hydrocarbon-induced leukemia in the rat.
Similarly, Nebert and co-workers observed
that phenobarbital given orally protected
against the bone marrow toxicity and lethal-
ity elicited by dietary benzo[a]pyrene
(B[a]P) in DBA/2 mice with AhdIAhd
genotypes (42). In mice with this genotype,
administration of B[a]P in the diet elicits
severe bone marrow depression resembling
aplastic anemia (42,43). Chronic adminis-
tration of a low concentration of B[a]P
results in leukemia (44). Phenobarbital
administration also reduced the covalent
binding of B[a]P equivalents in the bone
marrow. The basis for the protective effects
of phenobarbital against oral B[a]P-
induced bone marrow toxicity has been
attributed to its ability to induce phase II
enzymes, thus altering the toxicokinetics of
B[a]P. Rao et al. (45) have also observed
that vitamin A given to Swiss mice orally
decreased B[a] P-induced chromosomal
damage in bone marrow. Similarly, a

polyphenol containing tannin mixture
extracted from green tea suppressed
chromosome aberrations induced by afla-
toxin B1 in rat bone marrow cells (46).
Currently there is much interest in the
chemoprotective properties of green tea
and its possible utilization by humans for
this purpose (47).
As described above, it appears that
GSH and QR activity are cellular determi-
nants of susceptibility of HQ-induced
cytotoxicity to various bone marrow-
derived cell populations. This was sup-
ported by the studies utilizing BSO or
dicumarol to modulate cellular GSH or
QR, respectively (Table 3). Therefore, we
reasoned that the induction of QR and/or
GSH in target bone marrow-derived cells
may result in a chemoprotective effect
against HQ-induced toxicities. Based on
studies by Talalay and co-workers (35),
with tert-butylhydroquinone (t-BHQ) we
demonstrated that the induction of QR
resulted in protection against HQ-induced
cytotoxicity to stromal cells obtained from
C57BL/6 or DBA/2 mice (48). Although
t-BHQ is an effective inducer, it also has
cytotoxic effects that limit its usefulness for
this purpose. Thus, 1,2-dithiole-3-thione
(D3T) was used as the monofunctional
inducer in subsequent studies (13,21,29,49).
The data summarized in Figure 5, demon-
strate that D3T is an effective inducer of
QR and GSH in mouse and rat bone mar-
row stromal cells and the HL-60 and ML-1
cell lines. Accordingly, in these cells there

is a protection against the cytotoxic effects
of HQ. While constitutive expression of
QR is relatively deficient in HL-60 cells,
this enzyme can be induced 8-fold by D3T
treatment. However, the induced QR
activity of HL-60 cells is still not equiva-
lent to the basal activity of ML-1 cells
(29). In addition, while D3T is an effec-
tive inducer of glutathione S-transferase
(GST) activity in mouse or rat liver
(37,50), GST is not induced to a signifi-
cant extent in either mouse or rat bone
marrow-derived stomal cells (13,21) or the
HL-60 or in ML-1 cells (29).
Previous studies have noted that HQ is
selectively toxic to mouse bone marrow
stromal macrophages (9,10). At noncyto-
toxic concentrations, HQ inhibits the syn-
thesis of IL-1, thereby interfering with the
ability of stromal macrophages to commu-
nicate with stromal fibroblasts, the cells
which are responsible for releasing granulo-
cyte macrophage colony stimulating and
IL-3. Thus, as a result of inhibiting the
synthesis of IL-1, HQ can inhibit both
myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis (9,10).
Renz and Kalf (51) have shown that the
administration of recombinant IL-1 over-
comes the bone marrow suppressive effects
of benzene. We have also observed that in
vitro D3T treatment can prevent the effects
of HQ in suppressing the ability ofstromal
cells to support colony-forming activity
(49). Treatment of DBA/2 mouse-derived
stromal cells with a noncytotoxic concen-
tration of HQ inhibits colony-forming
activity by nearly 50% (Table 4). It has
previously been demonstrated that stromal
fibroblasts can maintain hematopoiesis
50% in the absence of functional macro-
phages (9,10). Moreover, as shown in
Table 4, stromal cells treated with HQ

with D3T.
D3T can also protect against the inhi-
bition by HQ ofthe differentiation ofML-
1 cells to monocytes and macrophages
(52). In these studies we used mitochondr-
ial maturation as a marker ofthe differenti-
ation of monocytes/macrophages (31,53)
by monitoring mitochondrial-dependent
lucigenin-derived chemiluminescence
(54,55). Shown in Figure 5, treatment with
D3T induces QR and GSH in undifferen-
tiated ML-1 cells. As such, in D3T-treated
cells, the inhibition of cell division and via-
bility by HQ is reduced (29). Likewise,
treatment of ML-1 cells with 10 pM HQ
for 3 hr prior to the induction of differen-
tiation by TPA results in altered differenti-
ation (52) similar to that seen with HL-60
cells (26). Pretreatment of the ML-1 cells
with BSO increases their susceptibility to
the differentiation-altering effects of HQ
(Figure 6). Conversely pretreatment with
D3T, which induces GSH, prevents the
differentiation-altering effects of HQ.
These observations suggest that the interac-
tion of benzoquinone with a sulfhydryl-
containing target molecule involved in
signal transduction may underlie the effects
of HQ on TPA-induced differentiation of
ML-1 cells to monocytes/macrophages.
The above in vitro studies with bone
marrow-derived stromal cells and the ML-
1 cells further demonstrate that QR and
GSH are determinants of susceptibility to
HQ and indicate that induction of QR
and GSH by D3T may be a useful chemo-
protective strategy against benzene-induced
hematoxicities. As such, in vivo D3T feed-
ing to DBA/2 mice was undertaken to
determine ifD3T has an inductive effect in
the bone marrow (49). The data presented
in Table 5 indicate that feeding 0.1% D3T
in the diet for 6 days resulted in a significant
induction of QR activity in bone marrow
stromal cells. Moreover, when challenged
ex vivo with 50 pM HQ, the cells from the
D3T-fed mice were less susceptible to the
cytotoxic effects of HQ than cells from
control mice. These results indicate that it
is possible through feeding D3T to induce
protective systems within the bone marrow
compartment. Although only the cytotoxic
effect of HQ was examined in these cells
from D3T-fed mice, one would expect that
they would also be less susceptible to the
inhibitory effects of HQ on cytokine syn-
thesis, which occurs at a lower concentra-
tion (Table 4). Clearly, further studies are
warranted to determine if D3T can protect
against the in vivo bone marrow effects of

should be appreciated that a chemoprotec-

the liver, where the metabolism of benzene
occurs. Of particular significance in this
regard is the role of glutathione S-trans-
ferase, QR, and glucuronosyltransferase in
benzene metabolism. Thus, the effect of
D3T in the bone marrow could be viewed
as modulating the toxicodynamics of
benzene-derived metabolites, while its effect
in the liver would tend to modulate the
toxicokinetics ofbenzene.
Identifying Individuals
Susceptible to Benzene for
Chemoprotective Studies
As with all potentially hazardous chemicals,
the best way to protect humans from the
chronic low-dose toxic effects of benzene is
to sufficiently reduce or, if possible, elimi-
nate exposure. Presently, cigarette smoke is
the major source of benzene exposure for
the general population (2). Even under the
best of exposure scenarios, there still may
be individuals who are so inherently sus-
ceptible to toxic effects of benzene that
some mechanistically based chemoprotec-
tive strategy may be warranted. The issue
then becomes how to identify these suscep-
tible individuals within populations. It is
clear from a number of studies that ben-
zene-induced hematotoxicity is determined
by the metabolism and processing of ben-
zene in both the liver and the bone marrow
(5,7,13,15). In the liver the major suscepti-
bility determinant is CYP2E1, since it is the
isoform of cytochrome P450 that catalyzes
the formation of phenol and HQ (6,7). It
is the further processing of these metabo-
lites to quinone derivatives and mucon-
aldehyde that has been most implicated in
benzene-induced toxicity (5). Studies have
shown that there are significant differences
in the CYP2E1 activity of human micro-
somes that are reflected in their metabolism
of benzene (7,56). Moreover, CYP2E1 is
inducible by alcohol exposure, which has
been shown to increase the risk for benzene-
induced toxicity (6). Thus, it is reasonable
to expect that within the human population
there are individuals who have high CYP2E1
levels and others who have low CYP2E1 lev-
els. Individuals with high CYP2E1 activity
would have the ability to produce more
hydroxylated benzene derivatives and as such
could be viewed as being more susceptible.
However, the bioactivities of these metabo-
lites could be balanced by the protective and
detoxifying systems present in the various
bone marrow cell populations.
Among the liver-derived metabolites of
benzene, HQ has been shown to accumulate
in the bone marrow of mice, a susceptible
species (24). Within bone marrow cells are
a number of possible mechanisms that
could convert HQ to the bioreactive
benzoquinone (16-19). As pointed out
(above), once benzoquinone is formed
within cells, its ability to interact with tar-
get molecules is determined by two factors,
QR activity and GSH (Figure 2). The cel-
lular activity of QR and availability of
GSH could also be relevant to the bioreac-
tivity of catechol and benzenetriol, other
polyhydroxylated metabolites of benzene,
while GSH would also be relevant to the
biological actions of muconaldehyde. As
was presented in Figure 4 and Table 1,
there are significant differences in QR and
GSH between different strains of mice,
between mice and rats, and between two
model human myeloid cell lines. In addi-
tion, there appear to be differences in QR
and GSH between undifferentiated and
differentiated ML-1 cells (Table 2).
Therefore, it is also reasonable to expect
that there could be significant variations
between humans with regard to bone mar-
row QR and GSH that could contribute to
their relative susceptibility to benzene.
Both hepatic CYP2E1 and bone marrow
QR and GSH should be taken into consid-
eration in determining the relative suscep-
tibility of individuals to benzene (Figure
7). As such, individuals with high hepatic
CYP2E1 and low bone marrow QR and
GSH could be viewed as being the most
susceptible within a population. Conversely,
those individuals with low hepatic CYP2E1
and high bone marrow QR and GSH
could be viewed as being the least suscepti-
ble within the population. As research con-
tinues on understanding the mechanisms
involved in benzene-induced hematotoxicity
(Figures 1,3), additional factors in the bone
marrow could be considered pertinent to
susceptibility. Nonetheless, presently it is
possible to phenotype individuals for
CYP2E1 activity through chlorzoxazone
hydroxylation (57,58). For the overall
assessment of bone marrow QR and GSH,
cells obtained from a bone marrow biopsy
would be the most relevant. Considering the
invasiveness of this procedure, this would
not be practical. However, it is quite possi-
ble that peripheral human monocytes and
polymorphonuclear leukocytes could be
used as surrogates for bone marrow stromal
macrophages and committed myeloid inter-
mediates, respectively, to obtain a relevant
assessment of QR and GSH studies. There
is an increase in QR and GSH with
mononuclear differentiation (Table 2). On

the other hand, we have observed that the
DMSO-induced differentiation of HL-60
cells along the polymorphonuclear pathway
is not accompanied by similar increases in
QR and GSH (Y Li and MA Trush, unpub-
lished observations). Thus, it should be pos-
sible to identify individuals who may differ
in their susceptibility to benzene; depending
upon their exposure to benzene, those con-
sidered more susceptible could be candi-
dates for some mechanistically based
molecular intervention. As the data in this
article have pointed out, D3T is able to
induce QR and GSH in several bone mar-
row-derived cell populations and in vitro
significantly modify several benzene
metabolite-induced toxicities. As such,
given the development ofoltipraz, a dithio-
thione, as a potential human chemoprotec-
tive agent in a targeted population (3), a
similar approach could be used in benzene-
exposed populations.
