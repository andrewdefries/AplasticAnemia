INTRODUCTION
Vitamin B6 is that part of the vitamin B~ complex which is respon-
sible for the cure of the specific dermatitis ("rat acrodynia''1) developed
by young rats fed a vitamin B free diet supplemented with vitamin
B1 and lactoflavin (3).
A good and potent source of vitamin B6, free from lactoflavin, is
Peters' eluate (4), which is obtained essentially by elution of a char-
coal adsorbate of an aqueous yeast extract with acid alcohol.
Lepkovsky, Jukes and Krause (5) have shown that rats need, in
addition to vitamin B6 and lactoflavin, a third, mainly growth-
activating fraction of the vitamin B2complex. This is also called the
"filtrate factor" (6), owing to the outstanding chemical properties
revealed during the course of preliminary attempts at its purification.
In the synthetic diet first used (3) for the production of rat acro-
dynia, rice starch was employed as the source of food carbohydrate.
When the experiments for purification of vitamin B6, preliminary re-
sults of which have been reported (7), were resumed, rice starch was
replaced in the diet first by corn starch, then by cane sugar. This
substitution was made after a specimen of rice starch had proved toxic
for rats and after it was found that corn starch, at least the brand

used, prevented or delayed the appearance of rat acrodynia, in con-
firmation of relevant observations by Richardson and Hogan (8).
Rats kept on a diet of this kind, deficient in vitamin B6 and con-
taining sugar, developed acrodynia in from 6 to 20 weeks. Treat-
ment with purified, less crude B6 preparations was in many cases
followed not by complete recovery but by a very acute, fatal anemia
and a great variety of symptoms of a concomitant hemorrhagic diathe-
sis. Medication with more complex B6 preparations, such as Peters'
eluate, or with certain foodstuffs, such as milk, liver and yeast, assured
final cure of the B6 deficiency disease without the complication of
abnormal hematopoiesis.
In several instances this peculiar hemorrhagic disease has been
observed by us in rats when there was no change in the experimental
conditions. On further study it became evident that this disease,
which at first gave the impression of being purely accidental, was a
distinct pathologic entity, with a well defined etiologic basis. We
were able to show that one constituent of the vitamin B2 complex
plays, apparently, an important part in primary blood cell production.
EXPERIMENTAL DATA
Rats, mostly albino,21 days of age,weighing not more than 35 gin.,were placed
on the following diet.

Each rat in an experiment received daily, in addition to the diet, 3 pigeon units
of a highly purified vitamin B1 preparation employed in previous studies (2) and
10T of crystalline natural lactoflavin, which was replaced in later experiments by
crystalline synthetic lactoflavin3
Animals with symptoms typical of acrodynia were treated with vitamin B6
preparations or with foodstuffs containing vitamin Be.
In those animals in which anemia and hemorrhagic manifestations followed
the successful treatment of vitamin B6 deficiency, the first sign of the impending
new disease consisted in renewed suspension of growth and in reduced foodintake.
Purified casein chiefly was used, but the results were duplicated in some
experiments with Merck's commercial casein.

Chemical Company, Inc., New York.

In untreated animals, anemia and hemorrhagic symptoms were often preceded
by spontaneous cure of a very mild acrodynia that usually started not more than
1 to 2 weeks earlier, and by further pronounced anorexia. Only exceptionally did
we observe rats in which the hemorrhagic disease came about without such pre-
monitory symptoms and in particular without preceding acrodynia.
Onset of the anemia was easily recognized in the albino rats by comparing the
color of their eyes with that of normal rats. A drop of 10 to 20 per cent in the
hemoglobin content of the blood could thus be estimated without difficulty. The
hemorrhagic diathesis was indicated by variable signs. One of the most common
symptoms was nosebleed. Usually this was not profuse and manifested itself
only in slight bloody discharge which soon dried up. In albino animals the bleed-
ing stained mostly the fur around the nose and, owing to repeated rubbing, also
the forepaws. In other cases the tear fluid was hemorrhagic and stained the
anterior corners of both eyes or even both eyelids, spectacle-like. Melena and
profuse hematuria were rather rare occurrences. Mild hematuria is not neces-
sarLly connected with the hemorrhagic disease and can be observed as an inde-
pendent complication, without any other hemorrhagic symptoms, in rats kept on
a vitamin B 8 free basal diet.
The most impressive manifestations of the hemorrhagic diathesis in question
were blood effusions into the Skin, exhibiting all the characteristics of purpura
(Fig. 1). In the gross there were patches of purpura of varying size, some con-
fluent, resulting in larger areas of dark red or blue discoloration. These occurred
mainly on the dorsum of the feet and, particularly, on the hind legs or on the face
and neck. The first but rather hidden purpuric patches appeared usually on the
back over the scapula or over the ribs close to the spine. We have observed patho-
logic disturbance of hematopoiesis in 72 rats thus far. Of these animals, 46 dis-
played visible purpura of a more or less severe degree. As a rule, purpura is a
late manifestation of this specific disease. When it appears it gradually increases
in severity until the fatal issue which normally follows in from 1 to 2 days.
Blood Morphology
Examination of the blood4 of rats in the acute stage of hemorrhagic diathesis
revealed (Table I), in the majority of the animals, low percentage of hemoglobin
4Blood was obtained by snipping off the tip of the tail after it had been soaked
for a minute in warm water. Hemoglobin percentage was determined by the
Sahli hemoglobinometer. Red and white blood cells were counted according to
standard methods, using the improved Neubauer counting chamber. Wright's
stain was used for differential counts and brilliant cresyl blue for determination
of reticulocyte percentage.
Platelets were counted according to the direct method involving the use of a
hemacytometer. Blood was drawn up in the red cell-counting pipet to the mark
0.5 and diluted with Rees and Ecker's (9) diluting fluid to the mark 101. The
platelets were then counted as in doing a red cell count and with the same cal-
culations.

and low platelet, white blood cell and red blood cell counts, with a very pronounced
granulocytopenia. The leucopenia and the disappearance of the granulocytes
may even be regarded as regular features of the disease and were missing in only
2 rats (6873 in Table I and 7237 in Table III) in the whole series. The poly-
morphonuclear cells when present were always segmented, frequently showing
vacuolation and other signs of progressive disintegration.
In the control animals, which were kept on the same vitamin B6 free diet as
were the anemic rats, we found constantly high hemoglobin, red blood cell and
white blood cell values, with a very distinct granulocytosis (Table II). These
animals had no signs of a pathologically impaired hematopoiesis, whether they
did or did not display symptoms of acrodynia. In view of the generally very high
platelet count in rats that had no hemorrhagic manifestations (Tables II and III),
a count of 100,000 or less can be considered pathologically diminished. This
assumption is borne out by the fact that the bleeding time after clipping the tail
to obtain blood for examination, in rats with a platelet count of 100,000 or less,
was very markedly prolonged. The clotting time was as a rule within normal
limits.
From the foregoing summary of the hemorrhagic manifestations
observed and the morphologic blood findings, it becomes evident that
we are dealing here with a profound disturbance of the primary blood-
584 PANMYEL0PHTHISIS
producing tissue, the reticulo-endothelium, in its transformation into
the three distinct types of blood cells, viz., into red blood cells, white
blood cells and megakaryocytes (platelets). Generally the disease
is ushered in by granulocytopenia but is followed soon by thrombo-
cytopenia, affecting the red blood ceils only at a later stage in the form
of a progressive anemia. This combination of symptoms and their
consecutive appearance are characteristic of the clinical entity called

by Frank (10) aleukia hemorrhagica, which again is more or less
synonymous with the term aplastic anemia.
The hematological data given in Tables I and III suggest in 2 rats already
mentioned (6873 in Table I and especially 7237 in Table III) the presence of pure
red cell anemia as a sign of a lesion involving only the red cell-producing system.
In exceptional cases, for instance in rats 7438, 7574 and 7867 (Table I), granulo-
cytopenia seems to be the leading symptom, and platelet production and erythro-
poiesis are normally active or are interfered with only to a mild degree. This
manifestation could be classified as uncomplicated agranulocytosis.

Anatomical and Histological Examination
Mucous Membranes.--Necroticand ulcerative changes around the mouth (Fig.
2) and on the mucous membranes, almost specific signs of human agranulocyto-
sis, were observed rather infrequently in the rats which displayed signs of granu-
locytopenia. Furthermore, changes of this kind have been encountered in rats
that were kept on the vitamin B6 free basal diet but did not show signs of disturbed
hematopoiesis.
Bone Marrow.--Fresh biopsy specimens of bone marrow (femur, humerus,
vertebrae) from a healthy animal showed that the marrow was very cellular and
included cells of all three blood systems: white blood cells, red blood ceils and
megakaryocytes. In contrast to this normal finding, bone marrow smears from
femur, humerus and vertebrae of a rat which succumbed to the experimental
aleukia hemorrhagica (rat 7570) showed distinctly reduced cell content. In the
gross the bone marrow cavities seemed to be filled with fluid blood. The bone
marrow of the vertebrae and femur could be considered very hypoplastic, and
that of the humerus even more so. Myelocytes and myeloblasts were only rarely
seen in the smears. Megakaryocytes were missing in the humerus and vertebrae;
only one was found in the femoral marrow. Normoblasts and early and late
erythroblasts were present and were more common than cells of the granulocytic
series. There were also phagocytic cells and, in the vertebral marrow, ceils that
were apparently lymphoid.
Similar findings were recorded in fresh bone marrow smears obtained from a
second animal that was in a rather less advanced stage of the disease (rat 7870).
The results of the examination of fresh bone marrow have been substantiated
by histological studies carried out on 25 rats in diverse stages of the disease.
Appearance of the marrow varied in different bones and in the bones of different
animals. In some, the only abnormalities were intense hyperemia, almost entire
absence of megakaryocytes and a reduction in the number of cells, chiefly the
granulocytes, in the marrow (Fig. 3). In others, in addition to the severe hy-
peremia, there was a varying amount of hemorrhage and edema, accompanied by
more pronounced reduction in the number of cells in the marrow, and the granulo-
cytes and megakaryocytes were altogether missing. Many of the patches of
edema contained deposits of fibrin (Fig. 4). Small deposits of brown pigment,
which did not give the reaction for iron but in many instances showed crystalline
formation in the characteristic burrs of hematoidin, were repeatedly found. In
the marrow of some bones of most of the animals and in that of all the long bones
of some of the animals megakaryocytes and granulocytes were entirely absent and
the hematopoietic ceils in the tissue of the marrow had almost completely dis-
appeared (Fig. 5).
Suprar~al Bodies.--A frequent postmortem finding in the internal organs,
and the most striking, was hyperemia and hemorrhage in the suprarenal bodies
(Fig. 6). The hemorrhage was easily recognizable in 24 out of 72 animals and
586 PANMYELOPHTHISIS
varied in extent from small patches, in the cortex or medulla or both, to diffuse
hemorrhage with obliteration of the natural architecture of the entire organ.
Microscopically, in the regions of hyperemia alone, the vessels were distended
with blood and the cells between them showed a varying degree and amount of
degenerative change. In those parts where the hyperemia was intense and also
in the regions of extravasation of blood, the parenchyma was almost or entirely
destroyed. The destruction of parenchyma was evidently secondary to the
hyperemia or hemorrhage because in the parts that were not affected by these
processes the parenchyma was quite well preserved (Fig. 7).
In the hyperemic and hemorrhagic suprarenal bodies of 2 of the animals there
were masses of bacteria in the cortex but no surrounding inflammation. Most of
the masses of bacteria were within the blood vessels, and the parenchyma imme-
diately surrounding them showed coagulation necrosis.
Kidneys.--Only 2 of the animals showed abnormalities recognizable in the gross.
These consisted of massive necrosis of the upper pole of both kidneys in one animal
and patches of necrosis in the upper pole of one kidney in the other animal.
They were the same animals in which the suprarenal bodies also showed loci of
necrosis with masses of bacteria in them. The kidneys of some of the animals
showed a varying amount of hyperemia and some were slightly swollen, but many
appeared quite normal.
Microscopically, the only change of a general nature was a varying degree of
degeneration of the tubular epithelium, which in no case was very severe. In the
portion of the kidneys of the 2 animals necrotic in the gross, the tissue showed
the typical picture of coagulation necrosis. In this necrotic tissue, however, and
mostly within the dilated blood vessels there were masses of bacteria. Sur-
rounding these bacterial masses there was no inflammatory reaction. With the
exception of the bacterial emboli no other cause of the necrosis was observed in
the sections. The large blood vessels were patent.
Spleen.--At macroscopical examination the spleen showed only hyperemia.
There were no striking changes of size and no other characteristics recognizable
in the gross.
Microscopically the sinusoids were distended with blood. In the pulp, espe-
cially around the lymphoid follicles (Fig. 8), there were zones of hemorrhage.
Most of the follicles had no germinal centers. The most striking abnormality was
the absence of megakaryocytes, In the pulp there was moderate cellularity with
a varying amount of histiocytic hyperplasia and fibrosis (Fig. 9). In the zones of
hemorrhage the pulp cells showed varying degrees of degenerative change but in
other portions they were well preserved. In the pulp of some of the spleens
there were small deposits of brown pigment similar to those in the bone marrow.
Intestine.--In several animals that had clinical melena the large intestine
showed, microscopically, some extravasation of blood in the mucosa without
accompanying inflammation.
Testes.--In 2 of the rats the testes, in the gross, were intensely hyperemic.
Microscopically, these testes showed great dilatation of the blood vessels and
GYORGY~ GOLDBLATT~ MILLER, AND FULTON 587
some extravasation of blood in the interstitial tissue. The parenchyma was well
preserved, but there were no spermatozoa in the lumen of the tubules.
Skin.--Microscopically, in the regions of purpura, the epidermis varied in
thickness. Especially was this true of the stratum granulosum and the stratum
corneum. The stratum spinosum showed varying degrees of parakeratosis and
acanthosis, presumably as the last remnant of the acrodynia-like skin manifesta-
tion which usually preceded the purpura. Extravasation of blood was present
within the epidermis and in the corium immediately beneath the epidermis. There
was no deposition of blood pigments, and little or no inflammatory reaction was
apparent around the extravasated blood. The deeper portions of the corium and
the subcutaneous tissue showed only occasional small foci of hemorrhage. The
upper part of the corium was hyperemic and edematous (Fig. 10).
The anatomical and histological findings are in complete accordance
with the conclusions drawn from observations made on the sick ani-
mals and from the appearance of the blood smears. In brief, it
becomes evident that this experimental disease in the rat, having for
its anatomical basis a more or less advanced panmyelophthisis, resem-
bles most closely the characteristic syndrome of aleukia hemorrhagica
in man. As to its cause, three possibilities have to be taken into
consideration: (a) nutritional etiology, (b) bacteriological etiology or
(c) eventually a combination of both,--bacterial infection with an
underlying nutritional factor.
Bacteriological Studies
Bacteriological studies~ have been carried out to clarify the question of a
possible infection. 5 rats were examined, all of which were in a rather advanced
stage of the disease. Blood, obtained by heart puncture, and spleen tissue served
as material; brain broth, blood agar plates and Endo plates were used as culture
media. The results were not conclusive and were even rather negative. In 2
rats slightly pathogenic Staphylococous aureus was found; in one rat the bacterio-
logical culture yielded apathogenic staphylococcus, in one rat Bacillus coli and
Bacillus proteus, and in the 5th rat the bacteriological cultures were completely
negative. Anemia and hemorrhagic manifestations were not observed when
intraperitoneal injection was made into 2 rats of 0.3 cc. of blood, taken again by
heart puncture from a moribund anemic animal (rat 7159), or when injection was
made into eight rats of 0.5 cc. of a 48 hour brain broth culture of mannite-ferment-
ing Staphylococcus aureus obtained from a rat that showed typical panmyelophthi-
sis (rat 7298).
We are indebted to Dr. E. E. Ecker of the Institute of Pathology, Western
Reserve University, for his valuable aid in these studies.
588 PANMYELOPI-ITHISIS
The 2 rats that received the blood of rat 7159 and 6 of the 8 rats injected with
the brain broth culture of the staphylococcus isolated from rat 7298 were on the
same vitamin B6 free diet that was fed the experimental animals. Several dis-
played specific symptoms of acrodynia. The basal diet of the 2 remaining injected
rats was deficient in lactoflavin; that is, it was supplemented with vitamin Bx
and Peters' eluate but not with lactoflavin. One rat on the vitamin B6 free diet
died in the first 12 hours after intraperitoneal injection of the brain broth culture
without exhibiting any sign of anemia or hemorrhagic diathesis. The remaining
7 animals on the B6 deficient diet and the 2 on the lactoflavin deficient diet were
observed for several weeks. No untoward effect was seen except for a slight local
abscess formation at the place of injection of the brain broth culture in some of
the rats, accompanied by temporary loss in weight. Blood examination 24 hours
after injection revealed no alteration in the direction of panmyelophthisis.

In view of these facts we are inclined to believe that the bacterial invasion found
in the majority of the panmyelophthisic rats examined for bacteria was a sec-
ondary process due to generally lowered tissue resistance. The same conclusion
may be drawn with regard to the coagulation necrosis in the suprarenal glands and
in the kidneys in which bacteriological emboli were found during histological
examination, as mentioned above. The absence of more pronounced inflammatory
changes is only a natural consequence of the breakdown in cellular defense and
tallies well with the histological picture in human agranulocytosis given by
Piette (11).
Great care was taken to exclude the possibility of Bartonella infection, which
has been proved to be an important and frequently even a misleading complication
in rats (12) and in dogs (13). The anemia produced by Bartonella infection in
rats and dogs is always accompanied by leucocytosis, in particular by granulo-
cytosis. Hemorrhagic manifestations were never recorded. In our anemic rats
that manifested hemorrhagic diathesis and granulocytopenia, Bartondla bodies
were missing, as was to be expected.
The negative or at least inconclusive results of the bacteriological
search for the possible etiology of the panmyelophthisis encountered
GYORGY, GOLDBLATT, MILLER, AND ~ULTON 589
in our rats bring again to the foreground the possibility that a nutri-
tional deficiencyis the main causative factor.
Summary ofExperimentalData
In previous studies on the vitamin B2 complex reported by one of
us (3) in which a synthetic diet was used consisting of rice starch,
casein (Glaxo), melted butter fat, cod liver oil, salt mixture and, as
supplements, purified vitamin B1 and lactoflavin preparations, the
syndrome of anemia and hemorrhagic diathesis was never observed.
In the studies now reported, rice starch was replaced in the diet by cane
sugar and the purified lactoflavin preparation by crystalline natural,
later synthetic, lactoflavin, while the vitamin B1 concentrate was of
the same source and of the same degree of purification as that used in
our previous experiments. Under these conditions panmyelophthisis
was noticed in 33 animals. Of the rats which manifested acrodynia
when they were kept on the vitamin B6 free basal diet and which were
subsequently treated with purified vitamin B6 concentrate preparede
from wheat germ, cane molasses and rice polishing, 39 developed ane-
mia and hemorrhages. In contrast to these facts, signs of aregenera-
tire anemia were completely missing in vitamin B6 deficient rats that
died from acrodynia or in those that were treated with cruder B6
concentrates such as Peters' eluate, yeast, cow's milk, human milk
(both milks in daily doses __>3.0 cc.), liver or wheat germ autolysate.
Anemia and hemorrhagic manifestations were also absent in rats that
received, in addition to the vitamin B6 free diet plus vitamin B1 con-
centrate, Peters' eluate instead of lactoflavin. The lactoflavin defi-
cient rats remained under observation for several months and never
showed any signs of pathologic hematopoiesis or hemorrhages. This
group included 85 animals. Of these, 49 have been successfully
treated with lactoflavin or with human milk and cow's milk, 16
eThese B6preparations represented differentdegreesof concentration. In the
case of wheat germ the purification was extended generally over autolysis, pre-
cipitation with lead acetate, adsorption on fuller's earth, elution with barium
hydroxide to precipitation with phosphotungstic acid and regeneration of this
precipitate with barium hydroxide. Details are given in the paper by Birch and
GyiSrgy(7). Similarpreparations have been made from cane molassesand rice
polishing.

succumbed to the lactoflavin deficiency, 6 to diarrhea, 2 to pneumonia
and 12 to other infections.
As to the incidence of panmyelophthisis, it has to be borne in mind
that the current experiments served primarily for purification of
vitamin B6. The group of vitamin Be deficient rats included 319 ani-
mals. Of these 52 were cured of acrodynia, 70 died from the same
disease, 41 succumbed to pneumonia, 30 to septic infections comprising
kidney and lung abscesses, 54 to diarrhea and other infections the
cause of which could not be determined and, finally, 72 developed
panmyelophthisis. This number appears to be a high percentage
considering the fact that in the majority of animals the Be deficiency
was not eliminated and acted as a complicating factor.
Panmyelophthisisdeveloped in several of ouranimals that had been
previously treated with vitamin Be preparations of varying purity and
cured of the Be deficiency disease. They were kept continuously on
the basal diet after treatment had been discontinued. In view of these
complications it is difficult to evaluate the significance of the length
of the preparatory period needed for the development of the hemor-
rhagic disease in question. We have observed the onset of the disease
after the following periods of time had elapsed.

Thus, on an average, 14 weeks elapsed before the first symptoms of
panmyelophthisis could be noticed, although they might occur after
5 to 6 weeks of a preparatory period.
As to the influence of sex, panmyelophthisis was observed in almost even
distribution: 38 female and 34 male animals.
Seasonal variations were a more pronounced factor. There were two distinct
peaks, one in spring and one in late fall, with a definite minimum in August,
September and October. The period of observations covered 12 months, from
June, 1936, through May, 1937.

The influenceof seasonalvariations cannot be explainedby temperature dif-
ferences, for the temperature of the animal room was kept at a fairly constant
level, exceptperhaps on days of very warmoutside temperature whenregulation
was not possible. In view of the depressing influence of cold environmental
temperature on the bone marrow, shown by Huggins and Blocksom (14), one
wouldhave suspectedthat the samephysicalfactor shouldat least acceleratethe
production of panmyelophthisis. Contrary to these expectations, out of 34 rats
which for varying periods up to 26 weekswe exposeddaily between 5 p.m. and
9 a.m. to cold temperature (about 40°F.) only one animal developed anemia
(rat 7237in Table III). Surprisingly,the samerat was one of the 2 animals that
manifested "pure red cell anemia" without diminution of the white cell and
platelet counts.¢
The fact that panmyelophthisis has never occurred in rats that have
received Peters' eluate was considered by us a possible clue to the
nutritional etiology of panmyelophthisis. In order to prove this
assumption we tried administering Peters' eluate to several rats ill
with panmyelophthisis. Unfortunately many animals were already
in a moribund state when the very acute, usually almost fulminant
breakdown in hematopoiesis was discovered. They died despite
treatment, from 1 to 2 days after it had been initiated, frequently
refusing any medication or food. In animals in which aleukia hemor-
rhagica was diagnosed at an early stage, administration of Peters'
eluate in doses corresponding to 10 to 100 gm. of fresh yeast daily
prevented the fatal issue and restored normal conditions. Out of 12
rats which survived the first 2 days of treatment, 4 died with very
severe manifestations of progressing aleukia hemorrhagica (3 on the
3rd and 1 on the 4th day of the therapeutic assay). 8, however, were
saved. They showed a gradual improvement in the morphologic
blood composition (see Table III) and in the permeability of the
vessels (purpura). It is of interest to note that in rat 7882 the
increase in the white cell count and in the granulocyte count was
the first sign that a positive effect was exercised by Peters' eluate,
the hemoglobin value, red cell count and platelet count at the same
time having still shown a decline. In rats 7811 and 7984 subcutaneous
medication proved equally beneficial.
In contrast to the negativeresultswith regard to the possibilityofaccelerated
productionofpanmyelophthisis,symptomsofacrodyniaappeareddistinctlyearlier
in the cold-treated rats than in the controlanimals (15).

sis, it is of essential importance to note that in rat 6946, which had made a complete
recovery after treatment, the microscopic appearance of the bone marrow and of

the spleen was entirely normal (Figs. 11 and 12), with numerous megakaryocytes
and other blood cell-producing elements,s
s An incidental finding in the autopsy specimens of bone marrow and spleen
from one patient who received Peters' eluate was a great increase in the number
of megakaryocytes and megakaryoblasts. We do not attempt to 'evaluate this
finding, but it is of interest because of similar findings in rats treated with the
same preparation.
G¥OROY, GOLDBLATT, MILLER, AND FULTON 593
DISCUSSION
From the foregoing r~sum~ of the experimental findings recorded
for 72 rats it becomes evident that a new disease of the rat has been
found. The hematological data, controlled by study of fresh bone
marrow smears and by histological examination of the bone marrow
and the spleen, together with a great variety of hemorrhagic mani-
festations, correspond to the classical syndrome of aplastic (aregenera-
five) anemia (aleukia hemorrhagica). It is now generally accepted
that the human counterpart of this disease, aplastic anemia, or pan-
myelophthisis as its histological equivalent, is the final combined result
of three more or less separate, pathologic reactions involving transfor-
mation of reticulo-endothelial cells into (a) red blood cells, (b) white
blood cells and (c) megakaryocytes. This conception is borne out by
the fact that morbid conditions that affect only one specific system of
blood cell production are widely known in human pathology; we have
(a) agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia from deficient production of
white cells, especially of granulocytes, (b) thrombocytopenia from
lack of platelets and (c) pure red cell anemia from diminished produc-
tion of erythrocytes caused by arrest in maturation of red blood cells
in the first stage of their formation.
These considerations apply equally well to our animal experiments,
especially with regard to the gradual transition of a partial aplasia,
as, for instance, agranulocytosis into fullydeveloped panmyelophthisis.
In rats, partial or total arrest in maturation of the reticulo-endothe-
lial cells has been produced by nutritional deficiency, and in particular
by lack of one constituent of the vitamin B2 complex, a component
which in this connection may be regarded as a specific maturation
factor. In some animals panmyelophthisis developed when they were
kept on the diet used by us, usually after spontaneous improvement
of a mild acrodynia which had just started. In the greater part of
our observations, however, the specific blood dyscrasia followed the
addition of a more or less purified vitamin Be concentrate, which was
administered in order to cure the acrodynia in progress. In the
majority of these cases the vitamin Be deficiency disease (acrodynia)
was in distinct remission, or even completelycured, before symptoms
of aleukia hemorrhagica became manifest. Therefore we have to
infer that the maturation factor must be different from vitamin Be.
594 PANMYELOPHTHISIS
Furthermore, in uncomplicated deficiency of the filtrate factor, symp-
toms of anemia or of a hemorrhagic diathesis were not noticed and
not reported (5). We could neither prevent nor cure panmyelophthi-
sis merely by addition of the fuller's earth filtrate of a rice bran extract
which was supposed to be rich in the filtrate factor (5). We believe,
therefore, that this factor cannot be the determining cause of the
specific disturbance in hematopoiesis. In our opinion it appears more
likely that the maturation arrest in the hematopoietic tissues that
occurred as a preliminary reaction to panmyelophthisis in our rats
is related to lack of a hitherto unknown factor (or factors) of the
vitamin B2 complex.
Such a theory of specific nutritional disturbance is borne out by the
fact that panmyelophthisis was regularly prevented and, in cases where
it was recognized in an early stage, also cured by a watery yeast extract
concentrate, represented by Peters' eluate. It was not prevented or
cured, however, by lactoflavin or by purified vitamin Be concentrates
or by a supposedly active filtrate factor preparation.
It is a common occurrence in vitamin studies that only one disease becomes
apparent in cases of a combined deficiencywhile the other deficienciesremain more
or less suppressed. For instance, rats kept on a diet deficient in the wholevitamin
B complex do not show symptoms of acrodynia but show merely symptoms of
polyneuritis or even only of dystrophy. Production of acrodynia is accelerated
by the addition of a sufficiently large amount of vitamin B1 to the diet (Kellogg
and Eddy (16), Gy6rgy (3)). By assuming the presence of a combined deficiency
in the basal diet used in our present studies, we may surmise that, under the
conditions chosen, vitamin B6 deficiency was the dominant disease, while pan-
myelophthisis was relegated to a more latent position. This prevalence is not
absolute, however, as we were able to observe in several animals in which the
concurrence of the two diseases ended in favor of panmyelophthisis. The domi-
nance of the vitamin B6 deficiency also satisfactorily explains the fact that
aplastic anemia was more frequently encountered in rats in which treatment of
acrodynia had been instituted with purified Bsconcentrates (presumably deficient
in the maturation factor or factors) than in the untreated rats.
Our investigations failed to find support for the assumption that,
in the production of panmyelophthisis, specific infection in addition
to basic nutritional disturbance plays an important etiologic r61e.
Although this negative result does not exclude with final certainty the
interaction of an undetermined bacteriological cause, which is then
GYORGY, GOLDBLATT, MILLER, AND FULTON 595
subject to nutritional influence, we have to regard an interaction of
this kind as a very remote possibility.
Whereas partial symptoms of panmyelophthisis, produced in animals by
nutritional means, have been described prior to our own observations, they were
either not recognized as such or at least were not recognized in their relation to the
common denominator of maturation arrest in the primary blood-producing tissue,
the reticulo-endothelium.
In chronological order the first contribution we have to mention is a paper by
Shipley, McCollum and Simmonds (17) in which it is stated that in rats kept on a
vitamin B complex free diet there might develop lesions in the bones "which are
essentially identical with those seen in guinea pigs suffering from acute and uncom-
plicated scurvy," hemorrhages in the medullary cavity and, finally, complete
destruction of the cellular marrow elements. Disappearance of the bone marrow
generally precedes the hemorrhages. Hemorrhages in other organs and, in par-
ticular, purpura-like blood effusions were not described, however, and Happ (18),
who carried out blood examinations on 2 rats of this group, failed to demonstrate
even a slight degree of anemia but found some leucopenia, significantly without
agranulocytosis. Shipley, McCollum and Simmonds attributed the pathologic
findings in bone and bone marrow to beriberi and compared them with scorbutic
manifestations in guinea pigs deficient in vitamin C. At the time of publication of
their findings, the composite nature of vitamin B was not realized. In view of
our recent observations we may consider that the bone marrow changes, including
the medullary hemorrhages, were a formefruste of panmyelophthisis and therefore
were manifestations of deficiency of a specific maturation factor.
In nursing young of mother rats which during pregnancy and lactation were kept
on a diet with an apparently suboptimal content of the vitamin B complex, present
as wheat germ or yeast, Sure and Schilling (19) and Moore, Brodie and Hope (20)
have reported, in addition to paralytic conditions, hemorrhages in the osteogenetic
tissues and also, with far less regularity, in the subcutis (petechiae) and in the
internal organs. Blood findings and histological bone marrow examinations were
not reported.
More closely resembling our own observations, but still far from the fully
developed picture of panmyelophthisis, are those recently described by Miller and
Rhoads (21) in dogs and by Day, Langston and Shukers (22) in monkeys. The
former authors emphasized the analogy of the clinical syndrome of agranulocytosis
with the condition encountered in dogs fed a modification of the black tongue
producing diet of Goldberger. Hematological data are given for 10 dogs. In only
one dog, however, did the granulocytes drop to a level as low as 15 per cent. They
were on the average >50 per cent, with a very definite total leucopenia. The
histological picture of the bone marrow given by Miller and Rhoads showed also
far from complete destruction of the granulocytes or other blood cell-producing
elements.
596 PANMYELOPHTHISIS
In 6 young macaques, Day, Langston and Shukers obtained evidence of anemia
and leucopenia resulting, in their opinion, from vitamin deficiency. Addition of
yeast to the diet prevented the disturbance in morphologic blood composition.
In general, as leucopenia developed in monkeys kept on the basal diet, "the
decrease in white cells appeared to be more at the expense of the neutrophils than
of the lymphocytes." But inasmuch as the differential counts were very variable,
the authors admitted that "it is difficult to make any broad statement that holds
true for aU the animals." This statement excludes also the diagnosis of a true
agranulocytosis, in spite of the unquestionable tendencyto it.
Hemorrhages and low platelet counts, indispensable attributes of panmyelo-
phthisis, were reported neither by Miller and Rhoads nor by Day, Langston and
Shukers. In a personal communication Day points out that the hitherto unpub-
lished platelet counts of his animals were usually within or only slightly belowthe
physiological range during the disease but that they always dropped distinctly
before death. Hemorrhages were absent even in this stage.
In spite of the incomplete symptomatology, the disturbance in hematopoiesis
described by Day, Langston and Shukers in monkeys and by Miller and Rhoads
in dogs may be considered to be probably related to the classical picture of aleukia
hemorrhagica encountered by us in rats. This analogy is substantiated by the
seemingly identical nutritional etiology.
Several authors (Witts (23), Beck (24), Fitz-Hugh (25)) have as-
sumed that a hypothetical maturation factor influences the regulation
of the primary blood production also in man. As to the origin of this
factor, endogenous (hormonal) or exogenous (dietary) sources have
been taken into consideration. For purely theoretical reasons Witts
regarded the second possibility as more consistent with clinical facts,
thus putting the pathogenesis of panmyelophthisis on a qualitative
basis similar to that of pernicious anemia, although he was at the same
time unable to identify the "maturation factor" for which he searched?
However, in man this supposedly nutritional etiology represents,
certainly to a greater degree than can be inferred from our animal ex-
periments, at least in the majority of cases, merely the background or
basis for the bone marrow depression and its clinical manifestations.
Although it is now generally accepted that bacterial influence is of
only secondary importance and that infections follow rather than pre-
cede aplastic anemia (Frank (10)) or agranulocytosis (Roberts and
Kracke (26), Baldridge and Needles (27), Thums (28)), toxic factors
9See Witts's scheme of anhematopoietic anemias showing point of action of
the substances essential for blood formation (23, page 549).
GYORGY, GOLDBLATT, MIILLER, AND PULTON 597
in many cases seem to activate or to release the chain of reactions
leading finally to the clinical syndrome of aplastic anemia and its sub-
groups. Lately the presence of such a causal toxic influence, as well
as that of the well known roentgenologic effect, has been proved for
organic arsenic compounds (29), for benzene (30), dinitrophenol (31),
gold preparations (32), quinine (33) and for amidopyrine (34), the
latter particularly with regard to agranulocytosis.
The question whether these substances exert their toxic influence directly or
through a secondary reaction, based on specificsensitivity,is not yet finallysettled.
The observations of Squier and Madison (35) as wellas those of Disselmeyer and
Zorn (36) seem to substantiate the presence of amidopyrine sensitivity in cases of
agranulocytosis during or after medication with this drug. It is particularly
interesting that administration of even one small dose of amidopyrine to these
patients after they had recovered had a definite depressive action on the bone and
on the bone marrow (35, 36, 37), an effect that could be closely followed in bone
marrow smears of biopsy material (Plum (38)). The same deduction applies
with regard to thrombocytopenicpurpura that occurs as result of quinine sensi-
tivity (33 b). On the other hand several authors, in the first place Kracke and
his coworkers (34), maintain that most of the chemical compounds prominent in
the etiology of panmyelophthisis and its subgroups act chiefly through their ben-
zene ring which, after it is oxidized in the body, acquires direct toxic properties.
On the whole, the experimental production of agranulocytosis in animals was
not successful in spite of several attempts. Infections (39), bacterial toxins (40)
and also, with rare exceptions (41), the drugs (42) that played a definite r61e in
suppression of the bone marrow function in man failed to produce conclusively
relevant disturbances in animals.
We tried to produce panmyelophthisis by administering amido-
pyrine to rats kept under experimental conditions that were the same
as those found necessary for spontaneous manifestation of the disease.
Unfortunately we encountered difficulties in administration of amido-
pyrine to rats by mouth. It was impossible to pursue medication
with 2 cc. of a 1 per cent solution of amidopyrine in 4 rats for longer
than 1 week. To 2 other animals 0.5 cc. of the same solution was fed
for 4 weeks. In all these 6 rats the results were completely negative.
The morphologic blood picture presented normal data, and no symp-
toms of hemorrhagic diathesis could be detected. These negative
results may be explained either by refractory behavior of our rats with
regard to a directly toxic action of amidopyrine or by the fact that it is
impossible to sensitize rats against this drug. The latter explanation
598 PANMYELOP~TIlISIS
appears especially likely to us in view of the general unsuitableness
of the rat for allergic experiments. But be that as it may, so far we
have not been able to demonstrate in rats ailing with panmyelophthisis
the presence of etiologically important toxic factors. Such non-toxic
forms of the disease occur also not infrequently in man. The con-
clusion drawn as to the intimate relation between inhibited formation
of bone marrow cells in man and that experimentally produced in
rats is therefore valid for the time being for these non-toxic, so called
idiopathic forms.
The experiments here reported cast new light or~the so called Water-
house-Friderichsen (W.-F.) syndrome that is characterized clinically
by sudden onset, prostration, high fever, hyperpnea, rapidly fatal
course and, as a special feature, by purpura in addition to monolateral
or more frequently bilateral suprarenal hemorrhage found at post-
mortem examination. The first case was mentioned rather casually
by Marchand (43) in 1880; later, Little (44), Dudgeon (45), Langmead
(46) and others have given similar reports, but only since the analysis
offered by Waterhouse (47) and later by Friderichsen (48) has its
character as a specific and independent entity been recognized. The
syndrome is usually encountered in young infants, from 6 months to
3 years of age, but it has also been found in older children and in
adults (49). It is certainly different in its genesis from the suprarenal
hemorrhage of the newly born, as the latter condition is determined
essentially by purely mechanical causes (50).
Purpura, suprarenal hemorrhage, prostration and a rapidly fatal
course frequently occurred in our rats as peculiarly grouped mani-
festations of panmyelophthisis. Furthermore, in a case of the W.-F.
syndrome Glanzmann (51) found progressive thrombocytopenia and
distinct diminution of the granulocytes with degenerative changes in
the remaining polymorphonuclear cells. Although these blood find-
ings seem to be rather exceptional, and leucocytosis prevailed in
similar cases (50 b), the close analogy between the W.-F. syndrome
and the appearance of some of our rats that were ill with panmyelo-
phthisis can be regarded nevertheless as exceedingly striking.
Etiology of the W.-F. syndrome is now generally attributed to a
septic infection and in particular, certainly in the majority of cases,
to a fulminant meningococcus sepsis which ends fatally before the
GYORGY, GOLDBLATT,MILLER, AND ]~ULTON 599
local alterations of meningitis may develop. However, in rats ill
with the corresponding syndrome we were unable to prove the exist-
ence of a primary infection as a decisive etiologic factor. Whereas a
negative observation such as this does not exclude with certainty the
presence of an unrecognized infection, the nutritional control of the
production of the syndrome in rats permits us to make at least another
important suggestion with regard to its human equivalent. From the
rat experiments we may hypothesize that the bacterial, septic etiology
of the W.-F. syndrome in man is built up on the basis of a nutritional
deficiency similar to that which we have found necessary for the pro-
duction of the analogous disturbance in rats. With this assumption
it becomes conceivable why meningococci provoke the specific W.-F.
syndrome only in certain persons.
The possible identity of the maturation factor active in our rat
experiments with vitamin K (52) is ruled out by the morphologic
blood composition and the normal clotting time in rats ill with pan-
myelophthisis as well as by the difference in solubility, vitamin K
being fat-soluble, the maturation factor apparently water-soluble.
The same conclusion applies with regard to the identity of the matura-
tion factor with so called vitamin P (53), the biological function and
clinical use of which certainly seem to be different from those of our
maturation factor.
SUMMARY
During the 12 months ending May, 1937, 72 rats were observed
that manifested typical symptoms of panmyelophthisis. The disease
may start as agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia or pure red cell
anemia, leading progressively, often rapidly, to aleukia hemorrhagica
with its typical manifestations (epistaxis, melena, hematuria, purpura).
Blood examinations revealed correspondingly low white cell, red
cell and platelet counts with very pronounced granulocytopenia (0
to 4 per cent). Bone marrow smears and histological findings were
consistent with the diagnosis of panmyelophthisis.
Suprarenal hemorrhage was a frequent postmortem finding.
The pathogenesis of this experimental panmyelophthisis and this
hemorrhagic diathesis is confined to special nutritional conditions.
These diseases have been observed by us in rats kept on a diet deficient
600 PA~YELOPHTHISIS
in vitamin B6, containing cane sugar and supplemented with vitamin
B1 and crystalline natural or synthetic lactoflavin. Lack of vitamin
B6, however, is not a necessary condition, since the disease was en-
countered in the majority of the animals after the specific deficiency
disease which became apparent in rats kept on the B6free diet was suc-
cessfully treated with purified Be preparations. Even in the untreated
animals kept on the Be deficient diet acrodynia was, as a rule, in dis-
tinct remission before symptoms of panmyelophthisis and hemorrhagic
diathesis became manifest.
By means of the addition of Peters' eluate to the basal diet, pan-
myelophthisis could be prevented and, in animals where it was recog-
nized in an early stage, cured. In view of these facts it is suggested
that Peters' eluate contains a specific maturation factor for the pri-
mary blood-producing tissue, the reticulo-endothelium, a factor which,
being different from lactoflavin, vitamin Be and probably also from the
so called filtrate factor, constitutes another distinct component of the
vitamin B~ group.
Bacteriological studies brought forward no conclusive positive
evidence for the infectious etiology of the experimental panmyelo-
phthisis in our rats.
The possible relation of this new disease in rats to aleukia hemor-
rhagica and its partial manifestations in man, as well as to the so called
Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, is discussed.
Administration of amidopyrine, at least under the conditions chosen,
failed to provoke panmyelophthisis in rats kept on the same diet as
that given to rats in which the disease spontaneously developed.
