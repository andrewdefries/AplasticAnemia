Background
Cause of death data are a critical input to formulating good public health policy. In the
absence of reliable vital registration data, information collected after death from household
members, called verbal autopsy (VA), is commonly used to study causes of death. VA data are
usually analyzed by physician-coded verbal autopsy (PCVA). PCVA is expensive and its
comparability across regions is questionable. Nearly all validation studies of PCVA have allowed
physicians access to information collected from the household members’ recall of medical
records or contact with health services, thus exaggerating accuracy of PCVA in communities
where few deaths had any interaction with the health system. In this study we develop and
validate a statistical strategy for analyzing VA data that overcomes the limitations of PCVA.
Methods and Findings
We propose and validate a method that combines the advantages of methods proposed by
King and Lu, and Byass, which we term the symptom pattern (SP) method. The SP method uses
two sources of VA data. First, it requires a dataset for which we know the true cause of death,
but which need not be representative of the population of interest; this dataset might come
from deaths that occur in a hospital. The SP method can then be applied to a second VA
sample that is representative of the population of interest. From the hospital data we compute
the properties of each symptom; that is, the probability of responding yes to each symptom,
given the true cause of death. These symptom properties allow us first to estimate the
population-level cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs), and to then use the CSMFs as an
input in assigning a cause of death to each individual VA response. Finally, we use our
individual cause-of-death assignments to refine our population-level CSMF estimates. The
results from applying our method to data collected in China are promising. At the population
level, SP estimates the CSMFs with 16% average relative error and 0.7% average absolute error,
while PCVA results in 27% average relative error and 1.1% average absolute error. At the
individual level, SP assigns the correct cause of death in 83% of the cases, while PCVA does so
for 69% of the cases. We also compare the results of SP and PCVA when both methods have
restricted access to the information from the medical record recall section of the VA instrument.
At the population level, without medical record recall, the SP method estimates the CSMFs with
14% average relative error and 0.6% average absolute error, while PCVA results in 70% average
relative error and 3.2% average absolute error. For individual estimates without medical record
recall, SP assigns the correct cause of death in 78% of cases, while PCVA does so for 38% of
cases.
Conclusions
Our results from the data collected in China suggest that the SP method outperforms PCVA,
both at the population and especially at the individual level. Further study is needed on
additional VA datasets in order to continue validation of the method, and to understand how
the symptom properties vary as a function of culture, language, and other factors. Our results
also suggest that PCVA relies heavily on household recall of medical records and related
information, limiting its applicability in low-resource settings. SP does not require that
additional information to adequately estimate causes of death.

Introduction
Cause of death data are a critical input into debates on
public health, assessment of epidemiological patterns and
trends, and guidance on allocation of scarce resources for
pubic health and medical care [1]. Cause of death data for
these purposes are equally important for high-income and
low-income countries, but the challenge of comparable
measurement is different. For high-income countries, the
main task is to minimize systematic differences in assignment
of causes of death over time and across populations. For
developing countries, where vital registration systems are
generally not complete, and progress toward higher levels of
coverage and certiﬁcation has been unacceptably slow, the
challenge is how to make better use of alternative cause-of-
death measurement approaches to reliably estimate popula-
tion-level mortality patterns. This paper presents a new
method for assigning causes of death based on an interview of
members of the decedent’s household.
Considerable effort has been invested to assess mortality by
cause based on information collected after death from
household members—termed since the early 1980s ‘‘verbal
autopsy.’’ Use of this approach can be traced to 1931 [2], but
the ﬁrst large-scale systematic application of it was in Matlab,
Bangladesh [3]. Because vital registration coverage has not
signiﬁcantly improved in developing countries, interest in
verbal autopsy (VA) methods has expanded to at least four
distinct settings: clinical trials and large-scale epidemiological
studies; demographic surveillance systems, such as those in
the INDEPTH network [4]; national sample surveillance
systems [5,6]; and household surveys [2]. Despite increasing
and widespread use of VA in ﬁeld data collection, utilization
of VA data for national epidemiological monitoring and
global/regional burden of disease estimation has so far been
limited. For example, WHO makes almost no use of VA data
for adult cause of death estimation because of the hetero-
geneity of VA implementation and non-ICD (International
Classiﬁcation of Diseases) cause lists. A notable exception has
been the use of VA data (for under-age-5 cause of death) to
dramatically reduce global estimates of measles mortality in
children [7].
The heterogeneity of VA design and implementation spans
several critical issues: instrument design, method for assign-
ing underlying cause of death, cause of death lists, recall
period, and type of respondent [8]. Two are particularly
critical: instrument design and method for cause-of-death
assignment. First, the instrument used to collect data after
death from a household member varies widely, limiting
comparability. Some ﬁeld sites use open-ended questions in
an unstructured interview, while other instruments are highly
structured checklists of symptoms and signs. Most instru-
ments also elicit information on health-care use, medical
diagnoses, and documentation of the cause of death. Second,
data collected through the VA instrument are analyzed to
assign an underlying cause of death in one of three ways:
physician review, expert algorithms, and statistical models.
Physician review is the dominant approach, since the critical
review of signs and symptoms approximates the clinical
review of medical records and case histories that informs
death certiﬁcation in hospitals and other health-care settings.
In addition, physician review has been the dominant
approach because convincing alternatives have not been
widely available. Most sites use more than one physician to
review the VA responses and assign an underlying cause of
death [8]. The use of physician review has served to mask the
heterogeneity of VA instruments and content, as studies
simply report the results of the physician assignment of
causes of death. Validation studies have been published
showing high sensitivity and speciﬁcity for selected causes [9–
11], but even with high sensitivity and speciﬁcity, there are
challenges in using physician-coded VA (PCVA) to derive
unbiased estimates of population cause-speciﬁc mortality
fractions [12–15].
Physician coding of VA data limits the potential use of VA
for population heath monitoring in three important ways.
First, local physician views on population epidemiology and
causal hierarchies probably exert a profound inﬂuence on the
diagnoses recorded. The inﬂuence of local medical culture is
also seen in vital registration data with medical certiﬁcation
[16]. Strong views of local physicians will decrease the
comparability of PCVA across populations. Differences in
estimated cause-speciﬁc mortality rates may not be due to
differences in the VA data themselves but simply because of
differences in these local views. Second, the sensitivity and
speciﬁcity of PCVA for deaths out of hospital may be much
lower than currently recognized. Nearly all published
validation studies have included collection of information
from the household on medical records, death certiﬁcates,
and recall of the cause of death by a health-care worker.
Inclusion of this information in the VA will clearly exaggerate
the performance of PCVA for deaths outside of hospital.
Third, PCVA substantially increases the time and cost
required to analyze VA data, limiting large-scale population
applications.
There are three broad research directions underway to
create more standardized underlying cause of death assign-
ment using VA: creation of consensus standardized VA
instruments; development of expert algorithms for assigning
the underlying cause of death; and development of statistical
methods. First, several initiatives are creating and testing
standardized instruments for neonatal, child, and adult
deaths [4,17]. Second, expert algorithms are based on the
concept of distilling the process of physician review into
standardized rules. These are meant to systematize the logic
that an individual physician would use to assign a cause of
death, but with the added advantage of consistent application
[18,19].
The third approach is to develop statistical models to
predict cause of death based on the detailed results of a
standardized VA instrument [19–23]. A wide range of
modeling strategies have been used, including logistic
regression, neural networks, and Bayesian approaches. Byass
et al. [21,24] have argued for the application of Bayes’s
theorem to individual cause-of-death assignments by using
the symptom-level data recorded in the VA. Using data for
rural Vietnam, that work demonstrated that such an
approach has promise in categorizing individual causes of
death when compared to PCVA. Recently, King and Lu [25]
presented a sophisticated method for estimating cause-
speciﬁc mortality fractions directly without individual
cause-of-death attribution. Their method resolves the prob-
lem of generalizing VA analysis to the population based on
test properties quantiﬁed in hospital validation studies. In
this paper, we bring together the insights from King and Lu,

and Byass et al. into a single method, which we have termed
the symptom pattern method (SP), to estimate both pop-
ulation-level cause-speciﬁc mortality fractions (CSMFs) and
underlying causes of death for individuals. Using data from
China, we investigate the performance of this method in
comparison to PCVA at the population level and at the
individual death level.
Methods
From a validation cause-of-death dataset for each variable
included in the VA instrument (henceforth called symptoms),
we can calculate the probability of household members
responding in each response category for each cause of death.
To simplify the explanation, let us assume all items in the VA
instrument are dichotomous. Let Sij be the probability that
household members say yes to symptom i for cause of death j.
If one considers symptom i like a diagnostic test, Sij is the
sensitivity of symptom i for disease j. Note that unlike most of
the literature on VA, we are not referring to the sensitivity of
the entire VA instrument subject to physician review, but
rather to sensitivity of a single symptom in the instrument.
Let Pj be the CSMF for cause j, and S1 be the proportion of
all VA responses that say yes to symptom 1 in the population.
Since the k causes of death are mutually exclusive and
collectively exhaustive, the fraction of deaths that reported
yes to symptom 1, S1, must be the sum of the fraction of
deaths that reported yes to symptom 1 and died of cause 1
(S11), the fraction of deaths that reported yes to symptom 1
and died of cause 2 (S12), and so on. This gives us
S1 ¼ S11P1 þ S12P2 þ ::::::S1kPk;
Since each death is in one and only one of the cause groups,
it must also be true that
Xk
j¼1
Pj ¼ 1;
and it then follows that
1 À
XkÀ1
j¼1
Pj ¼ Pk:
Combining the relationships above, we see that for any set
of k À 1 symptoms, the following set of linear equations must
hold:
S1 ¼ S11P1 þ S12P2 þ :::::: þ S1k 1 À

ð1Þ
If the Sij are known, this system has k À 1 equations and can
be solved for the k À 1 unknown values of P1 through Pk À 1. If
we have more than k À 1 symptoms, or in the presence of
measurement error, we could also estimate P1 through Pk À 1
using regression techniques.
We wish to employ these equations to estimate the CSMFs,
P1 through Pk À 1. A ﬁrst pass at this problem might select a
random subset of k À 1 symptoms and obtain values for Pj by
estimating a regression, or by solving the system of equations.
This process could be repeated, drawing many sets of k À 1
symptoms, resulting in many estimates of Pj. A ﬁnal estimate
for each Pj could then be obtained by computing the mean of
the estimates gathered over all of the symptom draws. King
and Lu advance this basic approach by randomly selecting
sets of symptoms, called symptom proﬁles, and computing the
Si and Sij values in the system of equations above for the
symptom proﬁles, rather than for the individual symptoms
[25]. This relaxes the assumption that, within a true cause of
death group, the responses to individual symptoms are
completely independent of one another. Over multiple draws
of symptom proﬁles, then, King and Lu’s strategy accounts for
the correlation between groups of symptoms. Each random
draw of symptom proﬁles yields an estimated set of Pj values.
The mean of these Pj estimates over all of the iterations is
then used as the best estimate of the CSMF for each cause j.
We ran the algorithm with 300 draws of symptom proﬁles. We
conﬁgured it to select 16 symptoms, each chosen from the set
of symptoms with equal probability; the symptom proﬁles
were then the combinations of those 16 symptoms that
actually appeared in the data.
After obtaining CSMF estimates, we can use them as an
input in a strategy to assign causes to individual deaths. For
an individual death i, the probability of dying from cause j
can be expressed following Bayes’s theorem as:
PðDi ¼ jjSiÞ ¼
PðSijDi ¼ jÞPðDi ¼ jÞ
Xk
j¼1
PðSijDi ¼ jÞPðDi ¼ jÞ
; ð2Þ
where P(Di ¼ jjSi) is the probability of individual i dying from
cause j, conditional on the observed vector of symptom
responses, Si. In the terminology of Bayes’s theorem, this is
called the posterior. It can be calculated for each individual
and cause of death. Since the causes of death are mutually
exclusive and collectively exhaustive, the sum of these
posterior probabilities for any individual death will be
100%. P(SijDi ¼ j) is the probability of observing the vector
of symptoms Si conditional on individual i having died from
cause j. If symptoms are largely based on the biology and
natural history of the disease, this probability can be
determined from well-designed studies in which a gold
standard diagnosis is known. The expression P(Di ¼ j), known
as the prior, is the probability that individual i died of cause j,
without taking into account the symptom response data. In
this case, we use the CSMFs estimated with King and Lu’s
strategy, outlined in the discussion above, as the prior for
individual-level cause of death assignment. In the same way
that King and Lu use draws of symptom proﬁles to estimate
the CSMFs, we repeatedly draw random combinations of
symptoms, compute P(SijDi ¼ j), and estimate posterior
probabilities for each cause of death. We repeat this many
times and take the mean of the results as our ﬁnal estimate
for the posterior probability for each cause. In the results we
present here, we choose symptom proﬁles by selecting 15
symptoms from the entire set, with each symptom equally

likely to be chosen. The symptom proﬁles are then the
observed combinations of those 15 symptoms that occur in
the data. We draw symptom proﬁles 50 times. In order to
uniquely assign an underlying cause of death to compute
concordance rates and to compare to PCVA, for each
individual, our cause-of-death estimate is then the cause that
has the highest estimated posterior probability.
We compute population CSMFs two ways. First, we take the
posterior probabilities estimated for each individual—that is,
the output of the individual-level application of Bayes’s
theorem—and we aggregate these posterior probabilities by
cause. We then use the relative distribution of posterior
probabilities for each cause of death, across all of the
individuals, as our updated estimate of the CSMFs. Second,
we sum the number of deaths assigned to each cause based on
which cause has the highest probability. The advantage of the
ﬁrst approach is that it more directly reﬂects the information
content in the data about the presence of each cause in the
population. The advantage of the second approach is that it is
fully consistent with the assignment of a unique cause of

death at the individual level. We present results from the ﬁrst
strategy and evidence that shows that the two strategies yield
very similar results.
To illustrate this approach, we have used data from our
China VA validation study based on medical record review
[11]. For the 2,089 deaths with a gold standard underlying
cause of death, and a completed VA instrument, we have
divided deaths into 23 mutually exclusive and collectively
exhaustive cause groups (see Table 1). These groups have
been selected such that there were at least 15 deaths in each
cause group, including the combined ‘other’ groups. Based on
the VA instrument, 47 dichotomous symptom variables have
been selected. We have ﬁrst tested the validity of our SP
method by sampling with replacement the 2,089 deaths to
generate two datasets: a validation dataset of 4,600 deaths,
200 for each cause, to estimate the values of Sij, and a
community dataset of 10,000 deaths, to which we apply the SP
method. One limitation of our use of simulation datasets is
that single deaths from the original dataset may be sampled
multiple times, resulting in less variation in symptom proﬁles
than we would expect to see in real data.
The gold standard underlying cause of death was derived
through expert review of the medical records by a panel of
three physicians. Medical records were abstracted by trained

ing Centre for Classiﬁcation of Diseases in Beijing to select
and code the underlying cause of death according to the
International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-
10) [11,26]. Further information is available in Rao et al. [27].
As in most VA studies that use PCVA, the instrument used
in China also collected information on medical record recall
from the household. This information includes items on
cause of death from the death certiﬁcate and burial permit,
hospital forms, and the child’s health card. Information from
at least one of these sources was available for 94% percent of
the deaths. We have repeated our analysis using both the full
VA data and the medical record history data by treating the
recall of medical records as if they were simply more Sij
values. To provide a comparison to PCVA, two Chinese
physicians recoded the 2,089 VAs blinded to medical record
recall. This empirical work also provides a test of the
importance of medical record recall on PCVA as opposed
to information contained in the symptom recall.
To further test the sensitivity of the SP method to the cause
composition of mortality in a community, we have used
sampling with replacement of the 2,089 China validation
dataset deaths with weights by cause to alter the background
cause composition for the community sample. We have used

composition for South East Asia subregion D (SEAR-D;
primarily India) and Western Paciﬁc subregion B (WPR-B;
primarily China). For the same community samples, we have
calculated the same results for PCVA as well as for the SP
method.
Three metrics of predictive validity have been computed:
for the population-level results, we calculate the average
percent relative error and the average absolute error for the
23 CSMFs. The average percent relative error is the average
amount that the estimated CSMF deviates from the true
CSMF, as a fraction of the true CSMF. In other words, it is the
average, over all of the causes, of the quantity

Performance of the individual cause of death assignment
has been evaluated using the concordance rate: the percent-

review, has been correctly assigned. Because this step
produces a probability distribution across causes, we calcu-
late the concordance rate based on the cause of death
assigned the highest probability of death.

information on the duration of symptoms. We undertook
extensive analysis using symptom duration data as further Sij
values, but this did not improve the performance of the
method over and above inclusion of just the symptoms. We
can think of each entry in the table as the properties of the
symptom (row) for the cause of death (column). For example,
the entry at the ﬁfth row and third column is 44%, meaning
that 44% of VA respondents for deaths from lower
respiratory infections responded yes when asked if the
deceased wheezed. There is clearly considerable information
content in the individual symptoms even without information
on the sequencing, duration, and clustering of symptoms.
There is also clear evidence that, like any survey instrument,
there is a signiﬁcant background noise for each symptom.
Injuries, whose occurrence can be expected to be uncorre-
lated with many symptoms, provide insight into these
background rates. For example, among deaths due to injuries,
21% of household members reported fever, 21% poor
appetite, 17% weight loss, and 15% skin disease; only 73%
reported that the decedent suffered an injury. The latter
surprising ﬁnding has also been observed in South Africa [28].
Some symptoms, which medical knowledge would suggest are
highly speciﬁc such as paralysis on one side, are present for
more than 10% of decedents for seven of 27 causes,
suggesting that this symptom has a different cultural
interpretation in China.
Table 2 summarizes the information from the last part of
the VA instrument on the recall of causes of death in the
death certiﬁcate, burial certiﬁcate, and household recall. We
have combined the data from all these sources into a single
measure, as they all reﬂect information from providers or
government registries as reﬂected through the recall and
experience of household members. These symptoms are our
coding of the information that physicians with access to
medical record recall had; each symptom is a phrase that
appears in the medical records, on the death certiﬁcate, or on
the burial certiﬁcate. We identiﬁed key phrases used in the
medical records, death certiﬁcates, and burial certiﬁcates and
mapped these phrases to ICD categories. It is possible that
meaningful local phrases may have been missed in this
mapping, which would tend to bias our analysis against the SP
method. The physicians who were blinded to medical record
recall did not have access to this information, and our results
without medical record recall do not make use of it. These

can be interpreted in the same way as Table 1. So, an
endorsement rate of 4% for the third row (lung cancer) and
second column (TB) means that for 4% of deaths whose
underlying cause was TB, the medical records, burial
certiﬁcate, or death certiﬁcate mentioned lung cancer.
Figure 1 summarizes the application of the SP method and
PCVA to a 10,000 community sample of deaths in China. With
medical record recall, the SP method estimates the true
CSMFs with average relative error of about 16%, while PCVA
gives relative error of about 27%. In absolute terms, the
average difference between the estimated and the true CSMF
is 0.7% for the SP method, and 1.1% for PCVA. At the
individual level, PCVA correctly assigns the cause of death in
slightly more than two-thirds of the cases, while the SP
method is correct for over 80% of the deaths. The depend-
ence of the physician assignment of cause of death based on
the recall of medical records is evident in the dramatic
change in PCVA performance when the medical records are
excluded. The average relative error for the CSMFs increases
to over 70% and the concordance rate at the individual death
level drops to below 40%. The SP method estimates of the
CSMFs is unaffected by the exclusion of the medical record
recall; the relative error remains at about the same level, 14%,
and the absolute error, at 0.6%, is similar as well. The
individual concordance rate drops slightly, to just under 80%
which is still signiﬁcantly better than PCVA. But the reality is
that symptoms alone are probably not a sufﬁcient basis for
assigning a unique cause of death to each individual;
diagnostic tests and imaging studies are critical for diagnosis
in many cases.
A long-standing concern with VA validation studies has
been that sensitivity and speciﬁcity of PCVA may vary as a
function of the cause composition of mortality [12,29]. To
explore this problem, we have varied the background cause
composition of the community sample of deaths generated
through sampling with replacement with cause of death
composition weights that match the SEAR-D and WPR-B
WHO subregions. Figures 2 and 3 summarize the three
measures of predictive validity: CSMF average relative error,
CSMF average absolute error, and individual concordance
rates. The results for both regions demonstrate that the SP
method produces quite accurate estimates of CSMFs and

individual concordance rates that are over 75% with no
medical record recall and over 80% with medical record
recall. At least based on these two simulation studies, there is
no evidence that the SP method is sensitive to changing the
cause composition of mortality.
Table 3 compares individual concordance rates for the
China community simulated sample by cause of death with
and without medical records for PCVA and the SP method.
For nine of the causes of death, the concordance rates for
physicians drops by more than 75% including: hepatitis B,
diabetes, colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, lower respiratory
infections, hypertensive heart disease, endocrine disorders,
rheumatic heart disease, and acute pancreatitis. For some
causes, such as hepatitis B and acute pancreatitis, PCVA
correctly assigns no deaths when medical record recall is
removed. For the SP method, the lowest concordances are in
other group I conditions, at 34%, other group II conditions,
at 61%, and lower respiratory infections, at 65%. We would

generally expect SP to perform least well on residual
categories of death like other group I conditions. These
residual categories represent an average symptom proﬁle of
distinct diseases included in the residual. Much of the distinct
information content in the set of Sij values is thus lost due to
averaging across different entities. The poor results for lower
respiratory infections may be due to the small number of
cases, 16, in the original validation dataset. Without medical
record recall, the same three conditions perform worst, at
53%, 64%, and 70% respectively.
Figure 4 gives an example of the posterior distributions
produced by SP for two deaths in one of the simulated
datasets. The gold-standard cause of death for both of these is
cirrhosis of the liver. Since we assigned the most probable
single cause to each death, we can see that SP would correctly
assign the cause in the ﬁrst death, where cirrhosis is the most
probable posterior cause, while SP would be incorrect for the
second death, where cerebrovascular disease is most probable
in the posterior. The distribution for the second death is
spread across the causes more evenly, meaning that the
symptoms were not as predictive as they were for the ﬁrst
death, where they are more focused on cirrhosis, hepatitis B,
and liver cancer. Although we have only used the most
probable posterior cause in assigning a single cause to each
death, these posterior distributions have information that
could be exploited for other purposes. For example, the
diffuseness of the distribution gives us some idea of the
certainty of the cause assignment.
As noted in the Methods section, we can calculate
population CSMFs by summing the number of deaths
assigned to each cause based on the highest probability cause
of death in the posterior distribution or we can sum the
posterior probabilities for each death across each cause.
Figure 5 compares these two approaches for the 23 causes in
the China data. For each cause, it shows the average CSMF
estimated for the 100 draws of data obtained by using the
single highest probability cause to the CSMF obtained by
using the full posterior distribution. The results are very
similar, with a correlation of 0.98. The most noticeable
outlier is the CSMF for cerebrovascular disease, which is
generally estimated to be larger when the single most
probable cause is used.
Discussion
Overall, the SP method does remarkably well. At the
population level, it provides more accurate estimates of
cause-speciﬁc mortality fractions than PCVA; indeed, at least
in China, PCVA is not a viable method for estimating the
cause composition of mortality at the population level. At the
individual level, it clearly outperforms PCVA in assigning
causes of death to individual responses, using the same
information. The difference is most striking when the two
strategies are not allowed access to information from house-
hold recall of medical records, which is the test most relevant
to implementing verbal autopsy in a resource-poor setting.
Based on this analysis of data from China, the superiority of
the SP method for estimating CSMFs and assigning causes of
death at the individual level does not appear to be affected by
changing the background cause of death composition in the
population sample. In contrast, in China PCVA appears to be
extremely sensitive to the availability of household recall of
medical records.
Cause of death assignment for some deaths must be highly
uncertain, because the information content in signs and
symptoms is limited. While we have emphasized in presenting
results the comparison of PCVA with SP using the highest-
probability cause for each death, this method generates an

uncertainty distribution across causes, as illustrated for two
deaths in Figure 4. These distributions are a direct reﬂection
of the information content in the VA responses. Future
studies may be able to make direct use of this information to
guide a deeper recognition of which causes can be more
accurately identiﬁed on the basis of signs and symptoms
alone. Conventions may be developed such that deaths for
which the uncertainty distribution is diffuse across many
causes would be assigned to an unknown or ill-deﬁned
category. In any case, the SP method provides a more realistic
reﬂection of the information content in the VA dataset.
Reanalysis of the China VA validation data by physicians
blinded to medical record recall shows that physicians are
highly inﬂuenced by this information, as one might expect.
Most published validation studies on PCVA include medical
record recall. The levels of sensitivity, speciﬁcity, or overall
concordance rates reported in the literature for deaths with
medical record recall are substantially overstated for deaths
that occur without contact with medical services. Some
authors [5] have even claimed that high inter-rater reliability
between physicians is evidence of the validity of PCVA. Of
course, high inter-rater reliability could simply be due to
multiple physicians using the medical record recall to assign
the cause of death, not the symptom patterns. As such, inter-
rater reliability provides no direct evidence of validity.
Because the SP method does not use physicians in assigning
causes of death, it has the potential to dramatically reduce the
cost of VA at the population level and to increase the
comparability of results across populations. Use of VA in
routine public health surveillance has in part been limited by
the availability of standardized international instruments but
more so by the practicality of using physicians trained in the
review of VA data. The SP method requires no individual
coders and will reduce cost and implementation issues.
Another major advantage is that it can be implemented in a
completely replicable manner in different populations. By
standardizing how causes of death are assigned and removing
the unquantiﬁable inﬂuence of physician prior beliefs from
the results, comparability across populations within a country
and across countries will be substantially enhanced.
The critical requirement for our method is that we know
the set of symptom level sensitivities Sij values or that we can
adequately predict these sensitivities for a population. This is
an important assumption with several implications. First, we
need to measure the Sij values in a number of populations and
to measure them for as many detailed causes as possible.
More data on stroke Sij values are not likely to be very useful,
but more for diseases such as hepatitis B or COPD would be.
Measuring the Sij values may also be challenging in resource-
poor settings where deaths coded to a reliable gold standard
are difﬁcult to locate using existing hospital medical records.
To address this issue ongoing ﬁeld studies, in Tanzania, India,
and the Philippines, are deﬁning more carefully strict
diagnostic criteria for gold standard cause attribution.
Second, we need to study the variability of the Sij values as
a function of culture, individual respondent characteristics
such as income, education or medical knowledge, and
decedent characteristics such as the experience of health
care. Large validation datasets such as the one being collected
in the Grand Challenges in Global Health 13 project [30] may

Validation of SP Method for VA Data
provide an opportunity to study the predictors of the Sij
values. Third, symptom responses may be profoundly affected
by disease natural history but they may also potentially be
affected by cultural factors; that is, it may be that the items on
the VA questionnaire will behave differently as a result of
culture. In these situations, local validation studies will be
needed to deﬁne how a VA item functions in a given
population.
New data are needed in different populations to conﬁrm
the success of the SP method. In this study, we simulated data
for the Chinese population and two WHO subregions based
on a sample of VA responses from China; further data
collection will allow us to test the generalizability of these
results to other parts of the world.
We suggest that VA validation studies need to be radically
redesigned. Most importantly, samples need to be chosen so
as to get approximately equal numbers for important causes
of death rather than a random sample of the population if we
want to accurately characterize Sij. This is an important
reversal of the usual validation study in which a sequential
sample of deaths in hospital is often used. As noted, stricter
review processes to determine the gold standard diagnosis are
also needed, so that only cases with medical records in which
the underlying cause can be determined with substantial
certainty are included. Such stricter gold standards are more
feasible to implement in low-resource settings when the
number of deaths meeting the gold standard for each cause
can be optimized.
In most cases, validation studies are undertaken for deaths
that have occurred in hospital, and household recall of the
hospital experience is included in what is presented to the
physicians. The key exception to this has been validation
studies of VA that seek to categorize deaths into only two
causes, AIDS and non-AIDS, where HIV serostatus in a cohort
is used as a the gold standard [27,31,32]. When this
information is excluded from the analysis, our CSMFs are
still as accurate but individual cause of death concordance
drops. In other words, VA at the individual level may not
work as well as published validation studies suggest when
applied to deaths of individuals who did not have contact
with health services prior to death. This is not a limitation of
PCVA or of our approach. Rather, it may simply be a
reﬂection of the true information content in the symptom
recall. Further research studies, particularly on PCVA
excluding all hospital and death record information, will
help to better understand this effect.
Our approach to VA cause of death assignment should be
tested and validated in other populations outside of China.
This will be greatly facilitated if research teams are
encouraged to put the full microdata from validation studies
into the public domain. We also see a need for a multi-
country validation exercise and a series of cause-of-death
surveys to derive Sij data, possibly using the newly developed
WHO standardized tools. If our methods are conﬁrmed in
other populations, the cost of obtaining useful, comparable
cause of death information in poor countries will be greatly
reduced. Combined with advances being made on verbal
autopsy instrument design, this research has the potential to

Editors’ Summary
Background. All countries need to know the leading causes of death
among their people. Only with accurate cause-of-death data can their
public-health officials and medical professionals develop relevant health
policies and programs and monitor how they affect the nation’s health.
In developed countries, vital registration systems record specific causes
of death that have been certified by doctors for most deaths. But, in
developing countries, vital registration systems are rarely anywhere near
complete, a situation that is unlikely to change in the near future. An
approach that is being used increasingly to get information on the
patterns of death in poor countries is ‘‘verbal autopsy’’ (VA). Trained
personnel interview household members about the symptoms the
deceased had before his/her death, and the circumstances surrounding
the death, using a standard form. These forms are then reviewed by a
doctor, who assigns a cause of death from a list of codes called the
International Classification of Diseases. This process is called physician-
coded verbal autopsy (PCVA).
Why Was This Study Done? PCVA is a costly, time-consuming way of
analyzing VA data and may not be comparable across regions, because it
relies on the views of local doctors about the likely causes of death. In
addition, although several studies have suggested that PCVA is
reasonably accurate, such studies have usually included information
collected from household members about medical records or contacts
with health services. In regions where there is little contact with health
services, PCVA may be much more inaccurate. Ideally what is needed is a
method for assigning causes of death from VA data that does not involve
physician review. In this study, the researchers have developed a
statistical method—the symptom pattern (SP) method—for analyzing VA
data and asked whether it can overcome the limitations of PCVA.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The SP method uses VA data
collected about a group of patients for whom the true cause of death is
known to calculate the probability for each cause of death that a
household member will answer yes when asked about various
symptoms. These so-called ‘‘symptom properties’’ can be used to
calculate population cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs—the
proportion of the population that dies from each disease) from VA data
and, using a type of statistical analysis called Bayesian statistics, can be
used to assign causes of deaths to individuals. When used with data from
a VA study done in China, the SP method estimated population CSMFs
with an average relative error of 16% (this measure indicates how much
the estimated and true CSMFs deviate), whereas PCVA estimated them
with an average relative error of 27%. At the individual level, the SP
method assigned the correct cause of death in 83% of cases; PCVA was
right only 69% of the time. Removing the medical record recall section of
the VA data had little effect on the accuracy with which the two methods
estimated population CSMFs. However, whereas the SP method still
assigned the correct cause of death in 78% of individual cases, the PVCA
did so in only 38% of cases
What Do These Findings Mean? These findings suggest that the SP
method for analyzing VA data can outperform PCVA at both the
population and the individual level. In particular, the SP method may be
much better than PCVA at assigning the cause of death for individuals
who have had little contact with health services before dying, a common
situation in the poorest regions of world. The SP method needs to be
validated using data from other parts of the world and also needs to be
tested in multi-country validation studies to build up information about
how culture and language affect the likelihood of specific symptoms
being reported in VAs for each cause of death. Provided the SP method
works as well in other countries as it apparently does in China, its
adoption, together with improvements in how VA data are collected, has
the potential to improve the accuracy of cause-of-death data in
developing countries.
