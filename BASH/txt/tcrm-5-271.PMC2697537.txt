Abstract: Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome is an electroclinical epilepsy syndrome characterized
by the triad of electroencephalogram showing diffuse slow spike-and-wave discharges and
paroxysmal fast activity, multiple intractable seizure types, and cognitive impairment. The intrac-
tability to seizure medications and cognitive impairment gives rise to eventual institutionalized
patient care. Only a small subset of seizure medications has been shown to be helpful in seizure
control. Most patients take up to 3 medications at high therapeutic dosing and are susceptible
to medication-induced side effects. The lack of medication efﬁcacy in seizure control has led
one meta-analysis to conclude that there is no single medication that is highly efﬁcacious in
controlling seizures in this syndrome. On this background, a new and structurally novel seizure
medication, ruﬁnamide, has been found to be beneﬁcial in the treatment of seizures in this
syndrome. In a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study, ruﬁnamide
was found to reduce seizures by over 30%. More importantly, it reduced the frequency of the
seizure type that induces most of the morbidity of this syndrome, the drop seizure, by over
40%. There were few side effects, the medication was well tolerated, and in the open labeled
extension study, tolerance was not found. In this review, we describe the main electroclinical
features of Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome and summarize the few controlled studies that have
contributed to its rational treatment. Currently, there is no single agent or combination of
agents that effectively treat the multiple seizure types and co-morbidities in this syndrome.
Our focus will be on the role of the new medication ruﬁnamide in seizure reduction in patients
with Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome.

Introduction
The Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome is a catastrophic pediatric syndrome characterized
by the electroclinical features of (1) electroencephalogram (EEG) showing abnormal
background, diffuse slow spike-and-wave complexes (1.5–2.5 Hertz) and paroxysmal
fast rhythms (10 Hertz), the latter may only occur in sleep; (2) multiple types of epilep-
tic seizures typically including tonic, typical absence, and drop attacks; and (3) slow
mental development and/or behavioral disturbance.1–3
The long-term prognosis is poor
because the majority of patients are medically refractory to antiseizure drugs (AEDs),
have frequent episodes of status epilepticus, and severe cognitive impairment. Due to
these factors, most patients eventually required institutional care.
Treatment is unsatisfactory. The ﬁnding of multiple seizure types, and exacerbation
of certain seizures by the very medication used to stop other seizure types, often leads
to over-dosing of medication, ineffective treatment, and pronounced expression of side
effects. Many, if not all patients, are on polytherapy. Only a small subset of AEDs
has found to be efﬁcacious in treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gaustaut
syndrome. Even using these seizure medications, up to 96% of patients with Lennox-
Gaustaut syndrome have seizures that are refractory to treatment.4,5

Saneto and Anderson
Against this background of partially effective treatments,
a recent double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study
found that a new seizure medication, ruﬁnamide, reduced
overall seizure frequency and in particular, tonic-atonic
seizures in Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome.6
Based on the data
derived from this study, the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved ruﬁnamide for adjunctive
treatment in patients with Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome in late
2008. Ruﬁnamide has been approved in Europe since early
2007 for add-on treatment in this syndrome.
In this review, we will discuss the natural history and
management of the electroclinical syndrome of Lennox-
Gaustaut. In particular, our review will concentrate on the
pharmacological properties and use of ruﬁnamide in the
context of the current knowledge of treatment for this medi-
cally intractable condition.
Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome
Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome is a catastrophic epileptic
encephalopathy of childhood. Gibbs et al7
ﬁrst described
the EEG pattern of slow spike and wave with Lennox, and
his colleagues Lennox and Davis,8
together with Dravet9
and Gaustaut et al10
further reﬁned the clinical picture of the
early onset of multiple seizure types and mental deﬁciency.
Although this syndrome has a long history in the epilepsy
literature, there is no consensus of what minimal features are
required for diagnosis when one of the triad of EEG or clinical
ﬁndings is missing. The deﬁnition is problematic as all features
may not be present at a given period of the syndrome and the
slow spike-and-wave pattern may be seen in other epileptic
encephalopathies. Most, however, require two absolute criteria
of (1) interictal, diffuse slow-spike-and-wave discharges on
the EEG and (2) frequent and multiple seizure types, includ-
ing tonic, atypical absences, and drop attacks together with
supporting ﬁndings such as cognitive impairment, medically
refractory seizures and paroxysmal fast activity in sleep.4,11
Electroclinical features
The age of onset is usually in early childhood between the
ages of 1 and 8 years with peak at 3 to 5 years of age.12
Onset can vary, as some patients do not express their ﬁrst
seizure until the second decade.13
Those with Down’s syn-
drome usually do not manifest the full syndrome until about
10 years of age.14
This syndrome accounts for approximately
1% to 10% of all childhood epilepsies.4,15
However, the real
ﬁgure is likely Յ4% as most patients with Lennox-Gaustaut
syndrome are seen in tertiary epilepsy centers accounting for
the higher estimates of incidence.16,17
The etiology of the Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome is diverse
with both cryptogenic and symptomatic causes. Symptom-
atic cases are due to a variety of diffuse gray matter lesions
such as hypoxic-ischemia, infection, malformation of corti-
cal development, chromosomal abnormalities, and head
trauma.18
Cryptogenic etiology accounts for approximately
25% to 33% of patients.4,18,19
Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome can
follow other epileptic encephalopathy syndromes, in par-
ticular, West syndrome and Ohthara syndrome.20,21
In some
studies, up to 25% of all patients have a history of West syn-
drome.18,15,20
The progression of EEG ﬁndings and multiple
seizure types from hypsarrhythmia, suppression-bursts, and
epileptic spasms suggests age-related factors in the evolution
of the electroclinical syndrome of Lennox-Gaustaut.
The characteristic interictal EEG pattern of slow spike-
and-wave complex (Figure 1) was initially described by Gibbs
et al.7
The record is dominated by 1.5 to 2.5 Hertz spike/
sharp-and-wave complex, which are diffuse and maximum
bifrontally but sometimes can be conﬁned to the anterior or
posterior head regions. Although the slow spike-and-wave
pattern is fairly symmetrical, a shifting asymmetry in different
bursts is common.18
The duration of the complexes can vary,
but they often appear in prolonged sequences as long as half
of the routine EEG record without clinical change. For this
reason, the slow spike-and-wave activity is usually considered
an interictal pattern. The slow spike-and-wave complexes are
sometimes not present on the EEG at the onset of seizures,
but can appear over 1 year later.22
Non-rapid eye movement
sleep augments slow spike-and-wave complex expression in
about 95% of patients with longer duration of discharges.18
Paroxysmal fast activity (Figure 2) is the second char-
acteristic EEG pattern of Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome and
occurs predominantly or sometimes exclusively during
nonrapid eye movement sleep.15
Discharge frequency is
usually between 10 and 25 Hertz, preceded or followed
by generalized sharp and slow wave complexes, and has a
duration of 1 to 9 seconds. The spike paroxysms show little
change in frequency throughout the burst. The discharges
are widespread in distribution and bilaterally synchronous
over both hemispheres. Shifting asymmetries are common.
When seen during the waking state, paroxysmal fast activity
is usually ictal and associated with tonic seizures. However,
in its most common ﬁnding during nonrapid eye movement
sleep, the EEG pattern is usually not associated with obvious
clinical signs. When not associated with clinical signs, this
pattern may sometimes be subclinical seizures.
The background frequency is slow for age in 65% to
90% of patients.22
The degree of slowing correlates with the

severity of intellectual impairment and is a poor prognosis
for normal development.18
One of the hallmarks of Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome is the
presence of multiple seizure types, with as many as 95% of
patients having multiple seizures.12
The most characteristic
seizures are tonic and are reported in over 75% of all patients
with Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome under the proper recording
conditions.12
Tonic seizures have a range of semiology, from
global involvement of the whole body to a slight upward
movement of the eyes associated with a brief change in the
respiratory and heart rate. Atypical absence seizures are also
common in Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome with over 75% of
patients expressing this seizure type.15
The typical semiology
is the progressive impairment of consciousness that is usually
incomplete and recovers gradually at the end of the event.
This may be difﬁcult to recognize in a cognitively impaired
child. The third most common seizure semiology are drop
attacks which occur in about 33% to 66% of all patients.15
These seizures are characterized by a sudden forward or back-
ward falls which take place in a fraction of a second. Drop
attacks caused by exclusive loss of muscle tone are rare.23
Most drop attack seizures are brief motor events associated
with a fall and represent either myoclonic-atonic, myoclonic,
or tonic seizures.23,24
The majority of the epileptic falls in
patients are the result of tonic falls.23,24
These seizures are
the most difﬁcult to treat and most dramatic to witness due
to bodily injuries involving the face and head. Other type of
seizures such as generalized tonic-clonic, myoclonic jerks,
and focal seizures occur in Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome but
are not an integral part of the syndrome.
More than 60% of patients with Lennox-Gaustaut syn-
drome will have a bout of status epilepticus.15
The two most
common types of status epilepticus are tonic and atypical
absence. Tonic status is often induced by intravenous (iv)
administration of benzodiazepine. The usual scenario is a
patient who is experiencing atypical absence status epileptics
and is given iv benzodiazepine to stop the atypical status.25,26
Atypical absence status epilepticus is often unrecognized
due to an already cognitively impaired child who looks
just a little more lethargic, irritable, or tired. The event is
usually characterized by a mild clouding of consciousness
that ﬂuctuates and may last for hours to more than a week.
The EEG during a status event is often difﬁcult to discern
from the interictal EEG. The slow spike-and-wave complex
discharges may become more persistent or an evolution into
an atypical hypsarrhythmia pattern may occur.27
The majority of patients with Lennox-Gaustaut syn-
drome continue to have medically refractory epilepsy,
neurocognitive problems and frequent episodes of status
epilepticus. Unfortunately, approximately 50% of patients
continue to have the full syndrome into adulthood. Most of
the remaining patients have varying severity of epilepsy and
cognitive problems with institutional care the norm. Only
approximately 10% will fully remit their seizures, but many
of these patients remain with cognitive problems.
Treatment
The intractability of seizures to medications and multiple
seizure types lead to the use of polytherapy, often at
high doses. Using high doses of medications increase the
likelihood of drug side effects. In this syndrome, certain
medications used to treat one type of seizure may exac-
erbate expression of other seizure types. Both carbam-
azepine and phenytoin used to treat tonic and generalized
tonic clonic seizure may exacerbate atypical absence and
myoclonic seizures. Intravenous benzodiazepines may
induce tonic status epilepticus.25,26
Although extensively used
in treatment, benzodiazepines may produce undesirable side
effects of drooling, incoordination and drowsiness. Together,
polytherapy, restricted range of efﬁcacious medications and
side effects of drugs on the tapestry refractory seizures, make
treatment unsatisfactory.
Although not tested in formalized clinical trials, valproic
acid is often used as ﬁrst line therapy. Three double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that several
of the newer AEDs, lamotrigine, felbamate, and topiramate,
are efﬁcacious as adjunctive therapy (Tables 1 and 2).28–30
Felbamate treated patients had a mean reduction in total
seizure frequency of 19%, compared with 4% increase
with placebo and complete cessation of atonic seizures in
17.9%, compared to 0% in the untreated group.29
Patients
treated with lamotrigine reported a median reduction in total
seizures of 32% compared with 9% increase with placebo
and when subdivided into speciﬁc seizure types, there was
a median reduction in drop attacks of 34% compared to 9%
in the placebo group.28
Patients in the topiramate study had a
median reduction of 20.6% reduction in total seizures, com-
pared to 8.8% reduction in the placebo group and a 14.8%
decrease in drop seizures, compared to a 5.1% increase in
the placebo arm.30
These studies were short in duration,
with maintenance phase of the study lasting 8 to 16 weeks.
In reviewing these studies in a meta-analysis, a Cochrane
review concluded that no single AED could be considered
highly efﬁcacious although lamotrigine, topiramate, and
felbamate may be helpful as add-on treatment for patients
with Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome.31
Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management 2009:5 275
Ruﬁnamide use in Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome
There have been other studies using non-medical
modalities to investigate seizure control. In a large multi-
center study of 50 patients with Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome
implanted with the vagus nerve stimulator, 43% of patients
had a 50% or more reduction in seizure frequency and sub-
sequently a 56% reduction, after 1 and 3 months of use.32
Patients undergoing corpus callostomy had a 90% reduc-
tion in drop attacks in 44/52 patients followed for a mean
of 40 months.33
Unfortunately, there are little comparative
data with AEDs.
Against this background of seizure intractability and lack
of efﬁcacy in seizure control, a new medication has been
recently approved for use in patients with Lennox-Gaustaut.
Based on data from a recent published study by Glauser et al,6
the FDA has approved the medication, ruﬁnamide, for use
in this syndrome.
Ruﬁnamide
Ruﬁnamide is an orally active, structurally novel compound
(1-[(2,6-difluorophenyl)methyl]-1 hydro-1,2,3-triazol-4
carboxamide) that is structurally distinct from other AEDs
(Figure 3).34
In experimental models, ruﬁnamide suppresses
neuronal hyper-excitability by prolonging the inactiva-
tion phase of voltage-gated sodium channels.35
In several
animal models, ruﬁnamide has been shown to have broad
spectrum of anticonvulsant activity. Ruﬁnamide suppresses
maximal electroshock (MES)-induced seizures in both rats
and mice models, and chemically-induced seizures in mice.
Rufinamide was also effective in the pentylenetetrazol
(PTZ) test in mice.36
For a complete summary of the studies
investigating the pharmacology of ruﬁnamide, the reader
is referred to an excellent recent review by Perucca et al.37
Another review of ruﬁnamide, which is more clinically based,
can be found in an article by Arroyo.38
Pharmacokinetics
Ruﬁnamide is a lipophilic compound with a log p-value
of 0.88 and water solubility of 40 mg/L.39
In a study of
3 healthy volunteers, ruﬁnamide was extensively absorbed,
with Ն85% of the drug absorbed. The mean maximum
plasma concentration (Cmax
) of ruﬁnamide was reached within
6.6 hours following a single dose of 400 mg.40,41
Absorption
is thought to be dissolution rate-limited rather than perme-
ability rate-limited and absorption is likely to take place
throughout most of the small bowel and possibly even part
of the large bowel.37
The inﬂuence of food was evaluated
in three studies in healthy subjects who were given single
doses of ruﬁnamide. Taking ruﬁnamide at least 1 hour from
meal times was not found to signiﬁcantly affect drug plasma
ruﬁnamide concentrations. However, when ruﬁnamide phar-
macokinetics are compared after a high-fat meal and after a
14-hour fast, differences in bioavailability become clearly
evident, and may have clinical relevance. After the high fat
meal, Cmax
increased 56% and the area under the plasma
concentration curve (AUC) increased by 36%.37
Therefore,
administering ruﬁnamide during intervals of prolonged
fasting may lead to appreciably lower plasma ruﬁnamide
levels, and therefore may alter seizure protection.
Ruﬁnamide is extensively metabolized to a carboxylic
acid derivative (CGP 47292) and to the glucuronide conjugates

of the compound CGP 47292 with minimal amounts excreted
unchanged in the urine and feces. Less than 7% of the dose
is excreted in the urine as the acyl-glucuronide metabolite
and none of this metabolite was found in the feces.40
Human
liver microsome studies indicate that ruﬁnamide is not
metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system. The principal
route is hydrolysis of the carboxamide by carboxylesterases
into a pharmacologically inactive compound CGP 47292.
The carboxylesterases are susceptible to induction by cyto-
chrome P450 inducers.42
In a multiple-dose study in patients with epilepsy,
400 mg given twice a day, the elimination half-life (T1/2
) was
6.9 hours on day 1 and 7 was unchanged on day 35.37
There was no difference in ruﬁnamide pharmacokinet-
ics between older (66–77 years) and younger (18–40 years)
healthy volunteers, in either single- or multiple-dosing
conditions.43
In a study of 16 children with epilepsy between
2 and 17 years of age treated with 10 or 30 mg/kg daily for
2 weeks, the pharmacokinetics were similar to that reported
in adult patients.44
Taken together, the data suggest that
ruﬁnamide requires no age-related dose adjustments for
children and elderly populations.
Due to the lack of renal excretion of unchanged drug,
renal impairment has no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on ruﬁnamide
pharmacokinetics. In this same study, steady state dosing was
evaluated in patients undergoing hemodialysis and it was
concluded that no speciﬁc dose adjustment is likely neces-
sary for patients undergoing hemodialysis.37
No studies have
examined ruﬁnamide and patients with hepatic disease.
The extent of plasma protein binding in vitro is low,
ranging from 26% to 34% at total concentrations of 0.25 to
19.6 μg/mL.37
Most of the binding is to serum albumin,
suggesting low potential for drug–drug interactions.
Drug–drug interactions
There have been no speciﬁc pharmacokinetic studies on
ruﬁnamide interactions with other AEDs. The effects of
other AEDs on plasma ruﬁnamide concentrations were
investigated in pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis
of data collected in efﬁcacy and safety trials.37,45
Ruﬁnamide
did not alter the CL/F of topiramate or valproic acid. At typi-
cal steady state levels of 15 μg/mL associated with a dose

Ruﬁnamide use in Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome
of 40 to 50 mg/kg/day, ruﬁnamide increased the CL/F of
carbamazepine by 15% in children, 9% in adolescents, and
8% in adults. This predicts a reduction in carbamazepine
steady state levels of 13%, 8%, and 7%, respectively. At the
same ruﬁnamide dose there was an increase in the CL/F of
lamotrigine by 16%, 11%, and 8% in children, adolescents,
and adults, respectively. This would suggest a mild reduction
in lamotrigine concentrations with co-administration of ruﬁn-
amide. Ruﬁnamide decreased the CL/F of both phenobarbital
and phenytoin by 12%, 9%, and 7% for phenobarbital and
17%, 9% and 6% for phenytoin in children, adolescents, and
adults, respectively. The prediction would be an proportional
increase in phenobarbital concentration, but due to non-linear
elimination kinetics of phenytoin, estimations of phenytoin
concentrations cannot be made with precision.
The administration of valproic acid was found to
increase ruﬁnamide concentrations. In a pooled analysis
of 400 children, ruﬁnamide concentration was increased
by 60% to 70% at an average steady state concentration of
valproic acid of 100 μg/mL. At the same average steady
state concentration of valproic acid, adolescents and adults
has smaller increases of ruﬁnamide concentrations, 26%
and 16%, respectively. In the latter two analyses, the steady
state concentrations of valproic acid were 88 and 71 μg/mL,
respectively. Although the exact differences in valproic acid
concentrations that would result in altering adolescent and
adult concentrations of ruﬁnamide cannot be fully ruled
out, it is likely that there is an age related affect of valproic
acid on ruﬁnamide. There were no signiﬁcant differences
between males and females. Analysis indicated that plasma
concentration of ruﬁnamide is not signiﬁcantly affected by
lamotrigine, topiramate, or benzodiazepines.
In contrast to valproic acid, co-administration of carba-
mazepine, vigabatrin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or prima-
done was found to decrease plasma ruﬁnamide steady state
concentrations.37
Again, the effect was more pronounced in
children. Carbamazepine reduced plasma concentrations
of ruﬁnamide by approximately 24%, 19%, and 21% and
vigabatrin decreased concentrations by 28%, 18%, and
14% in children, adolescents, and adults, respectively. The
effects of the remaining enzyme-inducing AEDs, phenytoin,
phenobarbital and primadone, were pooled. Ruﬁnamide
concentrations were reduced by 44%, 30%, and 25% in
children, adolescents and adults, respectively. The clinical
relevance of these changes is unknown, but the indication
is that interacting AEDs should be monitored after addition
or withdrawal as well as ruﬁnamide concentrations if the
clinical situation indicates it.
Safety
The relationship between plasma ruﬁnamide concentrations
and adverse effects has been assessed in 1398 patients com-
prising all patients in pooled controlled studies and clinical
studies.37,45
The most common side effects were dizziness
(13%), fatigue (12%), nausea (9%), vomiting (7%), diplopia
(6%), and somnolence (4%). The factors that increased the
probability of adverse events were plasma concentrations
of AEDs (including ruﬁnamide), age, gender, and weight.
There was an association with mildly increased side effects in
adults compared to children, increased body weight, female
sex, and plasma ruﬁnamide plasma concentration.
Ruﬁnamide side effect proﬁle is relatively narrow and
to date, non-life threatening when compared to lamotrigine,
topiramate and felbamate. The use of felbamate has been
restricted following reports of idiosyncratic reactions of
aplastic anemia and hepatic failure.47
Lamotrigine has been
found to cause potential life-threatening dermatologic reac-
tion, especially in the context of concomitant dosing of
multiple AEDs.48
Topiramate can produce oligohydrosis,
hyperthermia, metabolic acidosis and glaucoma.49,50
In healthy volunteers treated with ruﬁnamide for 18 days,
the QT interval was shown to decrease in a dose-dependent
manner.51
This would seem of little clinical signiﬁcance.
However, recently 22 patients have been described to
have short QT syndrome.52
This syndrome presents with
episodes of syncope, ventricular arrhythmia, and possible
sudden death. Ruﬁnamide would certainly be contraindi-
cated in patients with this syndrome as well as other drugs
that decrease the QT interval. The extent of this disorder is
unknown but caution should be used in patients with history

Ruﬁnamide and Lennox-Gaustaut
syndrome
Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome is a catastrophic pediatric
epilepsy syndrome, where over 90% of patients remain with
medically refractory seizures and have severe cognitive
defects and most often are institutionalized. Although some
medical treatments are helpful, none have signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced the treatment of this syndrome.31
As we have previously described, ruﬁnamide is a struc-
turally novel compound that most likely limits the excessive
ﬁring of sodium-dependent potentials. The pivotal study was
a multicenter double blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled
study (Tables 1 and 2).6
The requirements for entry were

multiple seizure types which had to include atypical absence
seizures and drop attacks (deﬁned as tonic-atonic or astatic
seizures), a minimum of 90 seizures the month before study
entrance (the 28-day baseline period) and an EEG pattern of
slow spike-and-wave complexes (Ͻ2.5 Hertz), and a ﬁxed
regimen of 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs. MRI or CT studies had
to demonstrate that patients did not have structural criteria
of a progressive lesion. The 28-day baseline period was
followed by an 84-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel group treatment period. Ruﬁnamide was dosed to
a target dose of 45 mg/kg/day and this dose was reached
within 7 days. Patient characteristics between the two treat-
ment groups were similar, age range from 4 to 30 years with
median age of 12 years and median weight of 34.7 kg.
The ﬁndings were dramatic. There was an overall reduc-
tion in seizures by 32.7% per 28 days, compared to 11.7% in
the placebo group (p = 0.0015). Moreover, there was a 42.5%
decrease in drop seizures frequency, compared to the placebo
increase of 1.4% (p Ͻ 0.0001). Due to seizure intractability
to AEDs and high morbidity, the decrease in drop seizures
is viewed as the primary outcome variable for treatment of
Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome.51
When the results are adjusted
to treatment size, ruﬁnamide decreased drop attacks by 41.1%,
compared to lamotrigine reduction of 19.9% and topiramate
of 14.8%. The authors indicate that caution should be used,
as data from cross-trial analysis with different methodologies
were used to report efﬁcacy outcomes.6
Ruﬁnamide reduced the frequency of atypical absence
seizures per 28 days (p Ͻ 0.03) and tonic seizures (p Ͻ 0.02).
No patients were seizure free during the study. Three patients
developed status epilepticus, but status events are common in
this syndrome, and therefore it was not clear if this was due
to ruﬁnamide dosing or the natural history of the syndrome.
Although only presented in abstract form, 123 patients contin-
ued to receive medication in the open-labeled extension phase
at a median dose of 1800 mg/day (range 103–4265 mg/day)
for a median duration of 432 days (range 10–1149 days).
The median total seizure frequency reduction observed at
12 weeks was maintained.52
Furthermore, 21.3% of patients
had a Ն75% reduction in total seizures during the extension
study. These data imply that tolerance may not occur with
ruﬁnamide use, at least over a 400-day period.
In the short double-blind study, there were few side
effects, only somnolence (24.3%) and vomiting (21.6%)
being the most cited adverse events. Treatment was also
associated with lower incident of cognitive/psychiatric
untoward effects (17.6% and 23.4%, respectively). In the
open-labeled study, the most common adverse events were
vomiting (30.6%), pyrexia (25.8%), upper respiratory
infection (21.8%) and somnolence (21%). The extended
study indicates that central nervous system side effects are
unchanged in long term exposure of ruﬁnamide.
Conclusion
The treatment of the catastrophic pediatric epilepsy
syndrome, Lennox-Gasutaut syndrome remains unsatis-
factory. Most patients remain having intolerable medi-
cally refractory seizures, cognitive delays and become
institutionalized. This past year the FDA approved a new
medication for adjunction treatment of this syndrome. Ruﬁn-
amide is a new and structurally novel seizure medication
that has proven to decrease the total frequency of seizures,
in particular, the most devastating of the seizure types, drop
seizures. It has few side effects and is well tolerated. It has the
advantage of full therapeutic dosing within 1 week, whereas
other approved medications, lamotrigine and topamax, can
take up to 2 months to reach therapeutic values. There does
not seem to be a change in efﬁcacy during long-term use.
It has few interactions with other seizure medications that
are likely needed to help control the multiple seizure types
found in this syndrome.
It is not clear if and how ruﬁnamide will synergize with
the nonmedical treatments of patients with Lennox-Gaustaut
syndrome of corpus callosotomy and vagus nerve stimula-
tion. In addition, the medical context of ruﬁnamide with
other medications that are being developed and/or other
medications that have been shown to reduce seizures in small
open-labeled studies should foster a better recipe for medical
and surgical management of this syndrome in the future.
Taken together, the data suggest that ruﬁnamide is a
viable adjunctive treatment for patients with the Lennox-
Gaustaut syndrome.
