(Received for publication, December 9, 1932)
When we first took up the study of the hemoglobin production fac-
tors in abnormal livers, we were surprised to find that the great
majority of these cases showed normal or perhaps low normal human
values. It is obvious from a glance at the tables below that only
under conditions of grave injury does the liver cell give up the unknown
substances which can be used to produce new hemoglobin and red cells.
Even in fatal liver insu:fidency (Table 25) the liver cells still contain
some of the factors which go to form new hemoglobin although the
amount of these hemoglobin production factors may be reduced to
1/3 normal. By way of contrast we observe in the next paper (Tables
31 and 32) that primary and aplastic anemias show a considerable
excess storage of these same factors within the liver.
The same methods and experimental procedures were used in these
experiments as described in the preceding paper--in fact all these
experiments developed during the same period and the cases were
assayed as material became available but the data are arranged
according to the abnormal findings.

A-1226. Heart disease--passive congestion of liver--hemoglobin 70 per cent--
44 yrs.
Liver--autopsy weight 2200 gm.--laboratory specimen 1840 gin.
Histological specimen--liver lobules show central atrophy as usual. These ceils
show some fat droplets and lipochrome pigment, The liver cells in the periportal
regions are normal. Kupffer cells not pigmented. A few bile canaliculi in center
of lobules show brown colloid.
A-1249. Heart disease--passive congestion of liver--hemoglobin 93 per cent--S3
yrs.
Liver--autopsy weight 1900 gm.--laboratory specimen 1100 gm.
Histological specimen--extreme passive congestion with complete central atrophy
of liver cells here. In center of lobule phagocytes full of lipochrome pigment are
numerous but mainly an empty reticulum is observed. In mid zone a few liver
ceils show fat droplets. The liver ceils in the outer half of each lobule appear
norll~l.
A-94. Old endocarditis of all valves--passive congestion of liver--41 yrs.
Liver--laboratory specimen 1240 gm.
Histological specimen--liver lobules show extreme passive congestion with central
atrophy and some cell necrosis. Bile canaliculi conspicuous in mid zone of lobule.
Portal tissue normal. About 1/3 liver parenchyma looks normal. Lipochrome
present.
A-78. Rheumatic heart with decompensation--passivecongestion of liver---41 yrs.
Liver--laboratory specimen 1370 gin.
Histological specimen--liver lobules show early acute passive congestion with
atrophy and central necrosis, about 2/3 liver cells look normal. Little fat, no
lipochrome. In some sections the liver lobules show necrosis involving almost
1/2 the liver cells.
A-60. Syphilitic aortitis--cardiac insufficiency--passive congestion--broncho-
pneumonia---45 yrs.
Liver--laboratory specimen 1340 gin.
Histological specimen--liver cells very small. Central atrophy present, a good
deal of fat, no necroses. Lipochrome abundant. Few leucocytes.
Table 21 shows typical instances of cardiac passivecongestionwith
"red atrophy" of the liver. Biological assay of this liver tissue shows
subnormal or low normal values and this may be explained by simple
atrophy and disappearance of many liver cells.
Table 21 shows one very unusual case--the last one in the table--
A-60. There was nothing unusual about this case clinically--a man
F. S. ROBSCIIEIT-ROBBINS AND G. H. WHIPPLE 655
with syphilitic aortitis and cardiac failure lasting several years. A
serious break in compensation was recorded 3 weeks before death.
Patient came into the hospital and died in 24 hours. The liver showed
the expected passive congestion. It so happened that this material
was divided and tested on two dogs. The smaller amount might not
be convincing but the larger amount, 120 gm. daffy, gave no evidence
of any hemoglobin producing factors in this material. Only one other
case in all this series shows a zero test--see Table 35 (Paper III), case
of eclampsia. We have no explanation to offer but believe that
methods and experimental procedure can be excluded.

If we exclude this last case A-60 from the average, we get an average
of 112 per cent which practically coincides with the degenerations
listed under Table 22. All cases listed in Table 21 show typical central
atrophy of liver cells, in some cases with more or less central necrosis
of liver cells. The usual mid zone of fat is found while the periportal
liver cells are normal. It is not surprising that this type of liver
atrophy (cardiac) should show some loss of these potent hemoglobin
producing factors as a goodly percentage of liver parenchyma has
vanished and its place is taken by reticulum, congested capillaries

ancl phagocytes. We may say that the normal liver parenchyma is
"diluted" by this much inert tissue. We believe the remaining liver
cells contain a normal amount of the substances which promote
hemoglobin formation under experimental conditions.

Histological specimen--fatty liver cells contain large and small droplets.
Moderate lipochrome, no fibrosis.
Table 22 shows typical cases of amyloidosis due to long continued
tuberculosis. The cases are arranged in order of the extent of the
amyloid deposit. The first two cases in histological sections show
about two-thirds of the section made up of amyloid. If we allow for
this "dilution" of the liver cells by this amyloid deposit we arrive at
figures about 3 times those given in Table 22 or high normal values.
If however on the basis of normal liver weights in tuberculosis we say
that there is an excess weight of amyloid amounting to 1000 gm. in
each instance we would find our calculations for the remaining liver
cells at about the normal level. There is no evidence that amyloid
contains any factors which favor hemoglobin regeneration although
most of the amyloid probably is undigested and unabsorbed.
Table 22 also shows that acute and chronic alcoholism does not
seriously deplete the store of hemoglobin producing factors in the
liver. In fact if we allow for the abnormal liver weight due to fatty
degeneration we arrive at values which are close to normal.

Table 23 shows various types of primary and secondary cancer
replacement and invasion of the liver. There is no evidence that cancer
cells even when originating from hepatic epithelium contain substances
which promote hemoglobin regeneration. It appears that the largest
liver specimens containing the largest mass of tumor cells give lower
values per gram specimen weight. We may say these masses of cancer
"dilute" the potency of the remaining liver cells just as is found with
amyloid deposit (Table 22). There is no reason to suppose that the
tumor material is not completely disintegrated and assimilated.
The first case (A-512) in Table 23 illustrates this "dilution" by
tumor tissue. This liver weighed more than 3 times normal and we
may safely assume that the liver cells made up less than the normal
liver weight. If we take this fact into consideration the concentra-
tion of hemoglobin production factors instead of rating 51 per cent of
control would read more than 150 per cent or normal.
The second case (A-54-31) in Table 23 shows a second instance of
primary liver carcinoma where there was little increase in liver weight,
yet the liver cell cancer did occupy a considerable (1/5-1/7) bulk of
the liver mass. If we allow for this "dilution" with inert tumor tissue
we arrive at a figure within low normal values.
The liver cells closely associated with masses of tumor cells are
usually supposed to suffer from hypothetical toxic material coming
from tumor growth and disintegration. The liver cells actually show
some atrophy and fatty degeneration and the tumor masses may inter-
fere with bile circulation and blood flow through liver lobules. In
spite of all this, the concentration of hemoglobin producing factors
within the liver cells is not significantly reduced.
In one instance (A-456) the iron analysis shows high values for the
total daily intake and this iron may account for more than half the
actual hemoglobin production which would mean a low value for the
liver cells even when allowance is made for the "dilution" with
cancer tissue.
F. S. ROBSCttEIT-ROBBINS AND G. It. WHIPPLE 661
Another case (A-1741) Table 23, shows a high iron analysis and
this iron intake undoubtedly is a factor in the production of hemo-
globin. This will in a measure offset the "dilution" of the liver speci-
men by tumor tissue but in this instance the final figure would be close
to 150 per cent or normal.

Liver--autopsy weight 2540 gm.--laboratory specimen 2050 gm.
Histological specimen--moderate to slight portal fibrosis, few new bile ducts.
Good deal of fat in central 3/5 of lobule, some degeneration with lipochrome
pigment deposit in liver cells.
A-730. Liver cirrhosis (slight)--pneumonia lobar--46 yrs.
Liver--autopsy weight 1500 gm.--laboratory specimen 1400gm.
Histological specimen--slight annular fibrosis with no new bile duct proliferation.
Many mononuclears, slight lobule distortion, little lipochrome. Liver paren-
chyma looks normal but for little fat. Occasional tiny hyaline necroses.
A-1024. Liver cirrhosis--icterus---carcinoma pancreas--53 yrs.
Liver--autopsy weight 1550gm.--laboratory specimen 1500gm.
Histological specimen--there is moderate portal cirrhosis and duct proliferation.
The liver cells are well preserved and approximate a normal appearance. There
are no necroses. Bile canaliculi often contain yellow colloid. Pigment is abund-
ant in hepatic epithelium and Kupffer cells.
Table 24 shows a considerable variety of liver cirrhosis and hepatitis
without any evidence of hepatic insufficiency. These cases died from
terminal infections, hemorrhage or alcoholism and presented more or
less severe passive congestion of the abdominal viscera with all grades
of icterus. It is obvious from a glance at Table 24 that the con-
centration of the hemoglobin production factors is not abnormal in
these liver specimens. There are considerable individual variations
but from the average of 164 per cent we see the low values rarely below
100 per cent and the high values rarely above 200 per cent.
Case A-1114, Table 24, presents the lowest value for the hemo-
globin production factors and there are some points which indicate a
possible hepatic insufficiency (see Table 25). A-1114 showed bleeding
into the intestinal tract and body tissues but a normal fibrinogen.
The liver cells did not appear seriously abnormal histologically. It
seemed safest to place this case in the group of cirrhoses without con-
vincing evidence of severe liver injury and insufficiency.
The iron analyses show an average value which is a trifle below the
normal averages. The lowest values appear in association with
secondary anemia--compare Table 33 (Paper III).
Icterus was present in varying degrees in this group of cases and
we see no reason to suspect that bile pigment stasis influences the con-
centration of hemoglobin producing factors in the liver cells.

A-956. Cirrhosis and hepatitis--liver insufficiency--hemoglobin 40 per cent--33
yrs.
Liver---autopsy weight 2160 gm.--laboratory specimen 2050 gin.
Histological specimen--the general picture is that of a coarse annular type of
cirrhosis in which scar tissue makes up more than half of all liver sections. This
scar tissue is full of mononuclear and a few polymorphonuclear cells. Only an
occasional island of liver cells is normal. As a rule the islands of liver cells show
focal injury and infiltration with wandering cells in large numbers. The picture
throughout the liver sections is that of a diffuse subacute inflammatory reaction
involving stroma and hepatic epithelium as well as bile ducts--a true diffuse
hepatitis., Lipochrome pigment is scanty. No pigment observed in Kupffer
cells. Occasional liver cells show bile canaliculi filled with yellow colloid (icterus).
Many liver cells show fat droplets. The blood fibrinogen was subnormal during
the last weeks of life and we may safely assume a true hepatic insufficiency.
A-982. Cirrhosis and hepatitis--alcoholism--hemoglobin 30 per cent----40 yrs.
Liver--autopsy weight 2700 gm.--laboratory specimen 2580 gin.
Histological specimen--no normal liver tissue anywhere. Remarkably diffuse
increase in stroma both in portal region and throughout all parts of lobules. Lo-
bules are full of tiny focal necroses in which wandering cells are numerous. Liver
cells are of every type, some large and hydropic, others showing fat, others hyaline
necrosis. Pigment is scanty. The regular architecture of the lobule is completely
destroyed. New bile ducts are inconspicuous. Blood fibrinogen 0.452 per cent
and normal blood clots at autopsy.
A-905. Acute hepatitis--icterus--delirium---soft clots and hemorrhages--hemo-
globin 75 per cent--14 yrs.
Liver--autopsy weight 1350 gm.--laboratory specimen 720 gin.
Histological specimen--no normal liver ceils, slight portal fibrosis with mononu-
clears. Central 1/2 of lobules shows extreme fat and even necrosis. Fatty
degeneration noted in marginal 1/3 of liver lobule. Here abortive bile duct
reaction seen. No pigment. Slight regeneration of liver epithelium, probable
hepatic insufficiency.
A-1628. Subacute hepatitis with cirrhosis--icterus--hemoglobin 58 per cent---45
yrs.
Liver--autopsy weight 3590 gm.--laboratory specimen 3170 gm.
Histological specimen--liver lobulation completely destroyed by a diffuse reaction
of cells and new formed stroma and bile ducts. There are focal injuries, acute
and chronic. The liver ceils are much degenerated and show abundant pigment
and in places bile canaliculi filled with brown hyaline casts. Pigment is abundant
F. S. ROBSCHEIT-ROBBINS AND G. H. WHIPPLE 667
in phagocytes in the stroma. Pigment is seen in the epithelium of the new formed
bile ducts. Mononuclears and polymorphonuclears are abundant in all parts of
the section. This liver appears insufficient yet the blood fibrinogen was normal.
The pigment in phagocytes gives an iron stain--only a part of the pigment in
hepatic epithelium gives an iron stain.
A-976. Liver cirrhosis--alcoholism--syphilis--hemoglobin 100 per cent--41 yrs.
Liver--autopsy weight 800 gm.--laboratory specimen 700 gin.
Histological specimen--a coarse annular cirrhosis of moderate grade. The stroma
between lobules is dense and filled with mononuclear cells and bile duct sprouts.
Much liver parenchyma appears but slightly injured but there is much fatty
degeneration and occasional focal necroses. The fibrinogen was subnormal (0.21
per cent) so that the liver was probably functionally subnormal.
A-709. Liver cirrhosis with fat--alcoholism--icterus--syphilis-~soft blood clots
--hemoglobin 92 per cent--54 yrs.
Liver--autopsy weight 5280 gm.--laboratory specimen 3500 gin.
Histological specimen--moderate annular portal fibrosis with some bile duct pro-
liferation and scanty mononuclears. Pigment abundant in some cells; bile canalic-
uli are distended with colloid. Liver cells much injured, great amounts of fat.
Some central necroses, many focal necroses. Hepatic insufficiency? The blood
clots in this case were quite soft.

below normal. The average figure is 48 per cent as compared with the
normal of 162 per cent. Most of these abnormal livers are below
normal weight so that if calculated for normal weight the figures
would be still lower.
In one case (A-1628) the iron analyses show a high figure and a daily
intake of 109 mg. Fe. This would account for about half the reaction
noted in this case which is higher than the average. It is probable
that there was blood destruction during the last days of life with excess
storage of iron in the phagocytes and hepatic epithelium as noted in
sections.

Cases of severe liver injury with anemia give the lowest values by
biological assay. The concentration of hemoglobin producing factors
may be less than one-fourth of normal. This invites speculation. We
may say that anemia alone does not appreciably reduce these hemo-
globin production factors (Table 33, Paper III). It may be argued that
the anemia is due to infections or tissue or intestinal bleeding some
time before death. This may in fact explain much of the anemia but
we would suggest that a factor may be introduced relating to liver
function. There is some evidence to indicate that the liver partici-
pates in active fashion in the preparation of parent substances for
hemoglobin production. Given a serious liver dysfunction in these
cases we have another cause for the anemia.
SUMMARY
Biological assay of human livermaterial shows various concentra-
tionsof hemoglobin producing material in various discascd states.
Cardiac congestion with red atrophy of the livershows values (Table
21) somcwhat below thc human normal--94 per cent compared to
162 per cent. It isprobable that thisisduc to atrophy and destruc-
tion of the livercellsin the centersof the liverlobules. We believe
the remaining liver cellshave a normal content of hemoglobin pro-
ducing factors.
Amyloid (tuberculosis) and fatty (alcoholic) degeneration show
(Table 22) subnormal values--t11 per cent compared to 162 per cent.
If we allow for the "dilution" of livercellweight by the amyloid and
fat wc observe normal valucs for the concentration of hemoglobin
producing factors.
Carcinoma growth in the liverwhcthcr primary or secondary shows
net figures(Table 23) which arc iow--75 per cent compared to normal
162 per cent. It appcars that cancer tissue,cvcn tumor cellsorigi-
nating from hepatic epithelium, contains no hemoglobin producing
factors. Ifwc allow for the "dilution" of thc remaining livercellsby
the cancer fissucthe figuresarc within normal limits.
Cirrhosis and hepatitis (Table 24) with no signs of truc hepatic
insu~ciency or severe hepatic injury but death supcrvcning from
secondary infection or hemorrhage will give average normal values
--l@i per cent compared to normal human of 162 per cent. Ictcrus
is not a factor.
670 HEMOGLOBIN FACTORS IN HUMAN LIVER. II
Cirrhosis or hepatitis with severe parenchyma injury and signs of
hepatic insuificiency give low values (Table 25) in biological assay
----48 per cent compared to normal human 162 per cent. It may be
surprising that the liver ceils hold so tenaciously to these unknown fac-
tors influencing hemoglobin production but obviously only in severe
liver injury is this concentration seriously reduced.
