Abstract
Background: Diseases caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) among adult patients with hematological
malignancies have rarely been investigated.
Methods: Adult patients with hematological malignancies at National Taiwan University Hospital between 1996
and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with positive serology for HIV were excluded. TB disease is
diagnosed by positive culture(s) in the presence of compatible symptoms and signs. The demographics, laboratory
and, microbiological features, were analyzed in the context of clinical outcomes.
Results: Fifty-three of 2984 patients (1.78%) were diagnosed with TB disease. The estimated incidence was 120 per
100,000 adult patients with hematological malignancies. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia had a significantly
higher incidence of TB disease than other subtypes of hematological malignancies (2.87% vs. 1.21%, p = 0.002,
odds ratio, 2.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-4.41). Thirty-eight patients (72%) with non-disseminated pulmonary
TB disease presented typically with mediastinal lymphadenopathy (53%), pleural effusion (47%) and fibrocalcific
lesions (43%) on chest imaging. The 15 (28%) patients with extra-pulmonary disease had lower rates of
defervescence within 72 h of empirical antimicrobial therapy (13% vs 45%, p = 0.03) and a higher 30-day in-
hospital mortality (20% vs. 0%, p = 0.004) compared to those with disease confined to the lungs.
Conclusions: TB disease is not uncommon among patients with hematological malignancies in Taiwan. Patients
who received a diagnosis of extra-pulmonary TB suffered higher mortality than those with pulmonary TB alone.
Clinicians should consider TB in the differential diagnoses of prolonged fever in patients with hematological
malignancies, particularly in regions of high endemicity.

Background
Although progress continues to be made with novel tar-
get therapy, chemotherapy remains the standard treat-
ment in most patients with hematological malignancies.
Side effects of chemotherapy include nausea, vomiting,
mucositis, neutropenia and impaired humoral and cellu-
lar immunity. Febrile neutropenia is a common compli-
cation after chemotherapy; and infection is the leading
cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with
hematological malignancies. Bacteria and fungi are the
major etiological agents of chemotherapy induced febrile
neutropenia in patients with hematological malignancies
[1,2]. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is a slow growing
microbe that can cause disease in both healthy and
immunocompromised persons. Yet TB disease in hema-
tological patients has been rarely investigated [3-5].
The clinical manifestations of TB disease differ between
cancer and non-cancer patients [3-5]. Cancer patients
infected with TB frequently manifest more atypical clinical
symptoms and signs [6,7]. The lung is still the most com-
monly involved site among cancer patients. However,
extra-pulmonary tuberculosis appears not to be uncommon

[5]. The incidence and mortality of TB disease are report-
edly higher for cancer patients compared to otherwise
healthy patients [6,7]. Ku et al. [8] and Cordonnier et al. [9]
had previously studied TB disease in hematopoietic stem
cell recipients. Since hematopoietic stem cell recipients
usually receive intensive immunosuppressant regimens,
they are at heightened risk of acquiring opportunistic infec-
tions. The diagnosis of TB disease is often difficult and
delayed in hematopoietic stem cell recipients [8,9]. Delays
in diagnosis of TB disease foreseeably could lead to fatal
outcomes in patients with acute leukemia [10].
Taiwan is an endemic area for TB disease with an
increasing trend of incidence over the past 40 years [11].
To define the role of TB disease in patients with hemato-
logical malignancies, we should improve the diagnostic
accuracy and direct therapeutic strategy in late stages of
febrile neutropenia in patients residing in regions of ende-
micity. In our previous epidemiological study, up to 60%
of bloodstream isolates in febrile neutropenia consisted of
gram negative pathogens and the leading gram negative
pathogens were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia,
Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia,
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [12]. How to differentiate
between competing diagnoses of disease due to TB or
aerobic bacteria (such as Enterobacteriaceae) in hematolo-
gical patients with febrile neutropenia is elemental in clini-
cal practice. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed
hematological patients with TB disease in a single univer-
sity hospital in Taiwan to investigate the clinical character-
istics and outcomes of TB disease in hematological
patients with febrile neutropenia.
Methods
Patients and hospital setting
National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) is a 2600-
bed teaching hospital in northern Taiwan that provides
both primary and tertiary care. Lymphoma, acute myeloid
leukemia and multiple myeloma were the most common
diagnosis of hematological malignancies [1,12]. All adult
(age ≧ 18 years) hematological patients enrolled in this ret-
rospective study were patients admitted between January
1996 and December 2009. Patients with hematological
malignancies who were HIV-positive were excluded.
Demographic features, hematological disease status, under-
lying medical diseases, laboratory and microbiological data,
and outcomes were collected and analyzed retrospectively.
The incidence of TB disease in patients with various hema-
tological malignancies was calculated. This research con-
formed to the Helsinki Declaration and local legislation,
and was approved by the local ethics committee.
Definition and diagnosis of M. tuberculosis
Definite diagnosis of M. tuberculosis disease was made
based on clinical symptoms and signs and positive
culture(s) for M. tuberculosis from sputum and/or
tissue. To prevent inclusion of non-tuberculosis myco-
bacterial cases, patients with clinical suspicion of M.
tuberculosis infections but without documented culture
results were excluded from this study. Pathological find-
ings of caseous necrosis, Langerhan giant cell and acid-
fast stain positive were in themselves insufficient as cri-
teria for inclusion. Synchronous infection was defined as
a diagnosis of TB disease within 3 months of hematolo-
gical disease diagnosis [5,13]. Readings of plain chest
radiographs for all patients at admission and diagnosis
of TB infection were reviewed by radiologists.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were compared using the chi-
squared test. Continuous variables were compared using
the Student’s t-test or ANOVA test. The significance
level was set at 0.05 and all p values were two-tailed. The
survival stratified by pulmonary and extra-pulmonary
tuberculous was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method and
log-rank test. All statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS 18.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Epidemiology of M. tuberculosis disease
Between 1996 and 2009, a total of 2984 patients were
admitted to NTUH with hematological malignancies,
including 1011 patients diagnosed with acute myeloid
leukemia (AML), 276 patients with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL), 956 patients with lymphoma, 307 patients
with multiple myeloma (MM), 169 patients with chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) or lymphoid leukemia (CLL),
and 265 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or
severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Of these, 53 patients
(37 males and 16 females) with a median age of 58 years
(range, 27-86 years) were diagnosed with TB disease. The
overall incidence of TB disease in patients with hematolo-
gical malignancies during the study period was 1.78%. The
numbers of TB cases among each subtype of hematologi-
cal malignancies were in descending order as follows:
AML, n = 29 (2.87%); ALL, n = 5 (1.81%); lymphoma, n =
8 (0.84%); MM, n = 5 (1.63%); CML/CLL, n = 1 (0.59%);
and MDS/SAA, n = 5 (1.89%) (Figure 1). Patients with
AML were more likely to develop TB disease than patients
with other hematological malignancies (2.87% vs. 1.12%,
p = 0.002; odds ratio, 2.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-
4.41).
Clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with M.
tuberculosis disease
The clinical manifestations and laboratory results of 53
patients with TB disease are shown in Table 1. Twenty-
six (49%) patients were diagnosed with TB disease at the
time of febrile neutropenia, while 27 (51%) patients were

diagnosed (including 5 patients without fever at diagno-
sis) with a non-neutropenic status. Patients diagnosed
during febrile neutropenia were more likely to be
patients with AML as opposed to other hematological
subtypes (19 of 29 patients, 66% vs. 7 of 24 patients,
29%, p = 0.013) and were synchronously diagnosed with
TB disease and hematological malignancies (54% vs.
11%, p = 0.001) more frequently than non-neutropenic
counterparts.
Sputum acid-fast stains and cultures were performed in
all 53 patients (median 3 sets, ranged 1-14). Of the 43
patients diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, nine
patients (21%) had smear-positive TB (both positive for
acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in sputum smear and culture posi-
tive for TB); the remaining 34 patients were smear-nega-
tive. Fifteen of the 53 patients (28%) had extra-pulmonary
disease, with positive cultures from lymph nodes (n = 4),
liver aspirates (n = 3), synovial fluid (n = 2), ascites (n = 2),
urine (n = 2), abdominal wall abscess (n = 1), and blood
(n = 1). Five of the 15 patients (33.3%) with extra-pulmon-
ary tuberculosis (lymph nodes, 2; liver aspirate, 1; urine, 1;
and blood, 1) also had concomitant pulmonary involve-
ment. The characteristics of pulmonary only versus extra-
pulmonary disease were similar in terms of absolute neu-
trophil count (2174 per uL vs. 1100 per uL, p = 0.76) and
hematological malignancies subtypes (AML subtype: 31%
vs. non-AML subtype: 25%, p = 0.87). The median dura-
tion of fever in patients with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis
was longer than those with disease confined to the lungs
(15 days vs 9 days, p = 0.025). In addition, patients with
extra-pulmonary TB had a higher 30-day mortality (p =
0.004, Figure 2) and were less likely to defervesce within
72 h after commencement of broad-spectrum antibiotic
therapy (13% vs 45%, p = 0.03). (Table 1) There were no
other significant predictive features to distinguish isolated
pulmonary from extra-pulmonary TB disease.
Drug resistance of M. tuberculosis and treatment
outcomes
Nine of the 53 different TB isolates (17.0%) from each
patient showed drug-resistance, including one isolate
(1.9%) resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin (multi-
drug resistant TB). The drug resistance percentages
were as stated for isoniazid (n = 5, 9.4%), streptomycin
(n = 4, 7.5%), rifampin (n = 1, 1.9%) and ethambutol
(n = 1, 1.9%).
Forty-eight (91%) patients received anti-tuberculosis
treatment during hospitalization; 39 (81%) patients
received standard anti-tuberculosis treatment (isonia-
zide, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) and 9
(19%) patients received fluoroquinolone based anti-
tuberculosis therapy. Patients with extra-pulmonary
tuberculosis had a higher rate of fluoroquinolone-based
therapy (38% vs. 11%, p = 0.048). No differences in the
timing of anti-tuberculous therapy initiation in relation
to the date of culture were observed between patients
with neutropenia and those without (median interval, 20
days vs. 22 days, p = 0.52), nor between patients with
only pulmonary disease versus extra-pulmonary disease
(median interval, 22 days vs. 22 days, p = 0.31).
Radiological characteristics of pulmonary tuberculosis
The radiological characteristics of 43 patients with pul-
monary tuberculosis are shown in Table 2. The chest
plain films at admission and at diagnosis of pulmonary
tuberculosis were evaluated. Twenty-nine (67%) patients
had chest computer tomographic images at diagnosis of
pulmonary tuberculosis. Typical findings in descending
order were mediastinal lymphadenopathy in 23 (53%)
patients, pleural effusions in 20 patients (47%) and fibro-
calcific parenchymal lesions in 16 patients (43%). Com-
puter tomography (CT) significantly detected more
mediastinal lymphadenopathy (p < 0.001) compared to
plain chest radiography.
Discussion
The increased utilization of anti-neoplastic agents in the
treatment of hematological malignancies is associated with
an increase of endemic opportunistic infections, for exam-
ple, tuberculosis. Neutropenia, impaired humoral and cel-
lular immunity are frequent complications in patients with
hematological malignancies. The symptoms and signs of
TB disease in patients with hematological malignancies
may thus differ from the general population [3,5,14,15].
However, the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and
outcomes are mostly undetermined. In Taiwan, estimates
of the incidence of TB disease ranged from 75 per 100,000
population to 62 per 100,000 population between 2002
and 2008 [16]. In this study, we estimated the incidence of
TB disease to be approximately 120 per 100,000 for
patients with hematological malignancies; namely an

increase by two-fold above the general population. Simi-
larly, Libshitz et al. had reported the incidence of TB dis-
ease to be 90 per 100,000 in cancer patients, a rate nine
times greater than the general population in the United
States [13]. These results show that TB disease is not
uncommon among patients with hematological malignan-
cies, especially in a tuberculosis endemic area.
The timing of tuberculosis reactivation or development
in patients with hematological malignancies is not clear.
Since 43% patients had fibrocalcified lesions on the chest
CT, we infer that most patients might have had previous
TB infection before febrile neutropenia. Reactivation of
tuberculosis in patients with hematological malignancies
could result from impaired immunity by underlying
hematological malignancies and/or chemotherapy
induced immunosuppression. The definite timing of
patients developed active tuberculosis disease needs
further prospective investigation.
Stefan et al. reported that acute lymphoblastic leukemia
was the most common malignancy in children with
tuberculosis [14]. Steroid and lymphoid malignancy both
impair cellular immunity and potentially increase the risk
of tuberculosis disease. However, Mishra et al. reported
that patients with AML rather than lymphoma had a
higher rate of M. tuberculosis disease [15]. Our results
support the observation that adult AML patients might
have a relatively higher rate of TB disease than other
types of hematologic malignancies. Since neutrophil
counts were unknown in previous studies [14,15], we dis-
covered that tuberculosis in AML patients is often asso-
ciated with significant febrile neutropenia compared to
non-AML patients (66% vs. 29%, p = 0.013). The risk of
acquiring TB disease may correlate partly with the
patient’s absolute neutrophil counts, but this association
may not be uniform across different types of hematologi-
cal malignancies. Recent research on human neutrophil
peptides has highlighted their bactericidal action against
TB and suggested that neutrophils may play a more
important defensive role in tuberculosis [17]. Neutrophil
could mediate innate immunity against mycobacterium.
In an adult tuberculosis cohort, risk of TB disease was
inversely and independently associated with peripheral
blood neutrophil counts in patients diagnosed with pul-
monary tuberculosis [18]. This result was consistent with
our study supporting the important role of neutrophils in
the defense against TB infection. TB disease might be
evaluated as an important differential diagnosis for
patients with hematological malignancies suffering from
febrile neutropenia in a tuberculosis endemic area.
Extra-pulmonary presentation of TB disease is common
in patients with hematological malignancies, ranging from
16% to 78% for all kinds of TB disease [5,13,19]. We
observed that 28% of hematological patients with TB dis-
ease had extra-pulmonary manifestations, in line with
prior studies [5,13,19]. In this study, we found that
patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis had prolonged
fever associated with worse outcomes. Cytokines play a
role in host defence of tuberculosis [20]. However, pre-
vious study revealed cytokine levels did not correlate with
localization of pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculo-
sis [20]. It might be possible that extrapulmonary TB
represented disseminated disease and delayed diagnosis

due to variable extrapulmonary manifestations in the
patients with hematological malignancies contributed to
excess mortality [21-23]. Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis
often presented with various symptoms and signs, such as
hepatosplenic tuberculosis, which may also mimic chronic
disseminated candidiasis [24,25]. Diagnostic procedures in
hematological patients are impeded by bleeding tendencies
and neutropenic status, thus the diagnosis of extra-pul-
monary tuberculosis could be delayed because of a lack of
tissue proof and cultures. Thus, in hematological patients
with prolonged fever without definite etiology, tuberculosis
might be one of the differential diagnoses in the clinical
practice of hemato-oncology.
Pulmonary infiltration is a frequent presentation of
infectious diseases in cancer patients [13]. Although non-
specific pneumonia is one of the radiographic findings of
pulmonary tuberculosis, it is not helpful for diagnosis. In
this study, most patients with hematological malignancies
and pulmonary tuberculosis showed mediastinal lympha-
denopathy, pleural effusions, and fibrocalcified lesions.
From this, reactivation of tuberculosis after immunocom-
promised status by hematological malignancies and/or
chemotherapy associated neutropenia is highly suspected.
Andreu et al. [26] reported that lymphadenopathy is the
most characteristic radiological feature in tuberculosis. In
enhanced chest CT, hilar and mediastinal nodes with a
central hypodense area supported the diagnosis [26]. How-
ever, only one patient had the typical presentation of med-
iastinal lymph node with central hypodense lesion. This
characteristic image finding is not sensitive enough to pre-
dict pulmonary tuberculosis. Chest CT scan revealed med-
iastinal lymphadenopathy in half of the patients with
pulmonary tuberculosis, which could be a better predictor
of culture positive tuberculosis. Computer tomography
was significantly better at discovering mediastinal lympha-
denopathy (p < 0.001) than plain chest radiography. Hence
chest CT might be a more valuable tool for diagnosing
pulmonary TB in hematological patients with clinical
respiratory symptoms/signs after chemotherapy,
Severe neutropenia produces relatively less tissue inflam-
matory response after chemotherapy in hematological
patients [27]. The atypical clinical presentations of TB dis-
ease in hematological patients makes a difficult diagnosis
in the context of coexistent disease even more difficult
[28]. By this token, we suggest that TB should always be
considered even as a remote possibility so that unusual
symptoms and signs are elicited, followed by at least three
sputum examinations. A plain chest film to screen for
tuberculosis in cancer patients with febrile neutropenia is
recommended by Taiwanese guidelines [29]. However, for
those patients without a definite diagnosis from chest
plain films and ongoing pulmonary symptoms, we suggest
chest tomography to be an appropriate modality for clini-
cal diagnosis of TB disease in regions of high endemicity.
Critically ill tuberculosis patients may have symptoms
of acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy, or infrequently septic shock
[30,31]. The search for causative pathogens in febrile
neutropenia is still a challenge in current clinical prac-
tices. According to this study, clinicians should remain
alert to the differential diagnosis of tuberculosis in
hematological patients with prolonged fever of unknown
etiology.
This study had the following limitations. First, only
hematological patients with proven tuberculosis were
enrolled, and some patients with low mycobacterium
burden might be excluded. Second, tissues biopsy and
cultures were not available for all hematological patients
because of bleeding tendency and neutropenic status.
Third, this study was a retrospective cohort; some lim-
itations such as concurrent infection in patients with
febrile neutropenia cannot be completely excluded.
Further large scale study should be conducted to con-
firm the findings based on our limited case numbers.
Conclusions
In conclusion, infections caused by M. tuberculosis are not
uncommon among patients with hematological malignan-
cies in countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis.
Tuberculosis causes significant morbidity and mortality in
patients with various hematological malignancies and in
recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplants. Patients
with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis had significantly higher
30-day mortality than those with pulmonary disease alone.
Clinicians may choose to evaluate tuberculosis as a differ-
ential diagnosis for prolonged fever in patients with hema-
tological malignancies in endemic areas.
