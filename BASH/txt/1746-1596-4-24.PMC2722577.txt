Abstract
Melanosis refers to abnormal or excessive deposition of melanin pigment in the cells and/or tissue,
which can be seen in any organ but commonly in skin and oral mucosa. Melanosis of the urinary
bladder is an extremely rare benign condition and only a handful of cases been reported in the
English literature before. In this article, we report a new case of urinary melanosis, describe the
differential diagnostic features from pseudomelanosis and offer clues for correct diagnosis. We also
provide comprehensive review of the literature on the subject.
Background
Melanosis refers to abnormal/excessive deposits of mela-
nin in the cells and/or tissue. This condition can be seen
in any organ but more frequently in the skin and oral
mucosa. Melanosis of the urinary bladder is a very rare
benign condition and only 6 cases have been reported in
English literature thus far [1-4]. Here, we report a new
case, review the previously reported cases and discuss the
criteria for making correct diagnosis.
Case presentation
The patient is a 77 year-old African-American woman
with medical history of urinary incontinence, large vol-
ume leakage, and severe urgency with leakage. She has
been using diapers for the past two years. She was on Det-
rol LA for six months but no improvement of her symp-
toms. The patient was referred to our institution for
further treatment. Under cystoscopy examination, clusters
of punctuate dark spots were observed on the right lateral
aspect of the bladder floor. There were no other lesions
identified. Biopsies were obtained from the dark spots,
and urine was sent for cytology. The patient had no previ-
ous cystoscopy examination or any other pigmented
lesions on the skin or mucosal surfaces.
Results
Pathologic findings
The biopsy specimen consisted of multiple tan soft tissue
bits ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 cm in greatest dimension.
Microscopically, the sections showed benign urothelial
mucosa with brown pigments focally present in the cyto-
plasm of urothelial cells. The pigments ranged from rela-
tively light brown powdery to dark brown globules. The
pigments were seen mainly in the cytoplasm and were
partially or completely obscuring the nuclei. The underly-
ing lamina propria showed mild congestion and acute

inflammation with no pigment deposit (Figure 1). Special
stains including Fontana Masson, Periodic Acid Schiff
(PAS) and Gomori's iron stain were performed. The pig-
ments were found to be positive by Fontana stain, consist-
ent with melanin (Figure 2), while the stains for PAS and
Gomori's iron were negative. The pigments disappeared
after bleach procedure, further confirming the presence of
melanin. There were no melanocytes identified in Hema-
toxylin & Eosin stained sections, or immunohistochemi-
cal stained sections for S100 protein, and HMB45 (human
melanosome). The case was diagnosed as urinary melano-
sis. The urine cytology was negative for malignant cells
and no pigmented urothelial cells were seen.
Discussion
Urinary melanosis is a very rare lesion and the exact inci-
dence can not be determined. We reviewed all the availa-
ble previously reported urothelial melanosis in the
English literature. All patients in reported cases have some
associated urinary symptoms such as, hematuria, diffi-
culty voiding, or urinary incontinence. The age of the
patients ranges from 43 to 86 years old and both sexes
have been affected.
Cystoscopically, brown to black pigmentation of the uri-
nary bladder mucosa with flat or punctate patterns is usu-
ally observed. The pigmentation can be seen in any
location of the bladder. There has been no description of
associated mass lesions.
Histologically, dark brown pigments are present mainly in
the urothelial cells, but sometimes few pigment deposits
are also seen in the lamina propria. The pigments are non-
refractile, powdery and can form variable sized globules.
The pigments are positive by Fontana Masson stain, and
negative for PAS and Gomori's or Lillie's iron stains. The
melanin pigment disappears after melanin bleach treat-
ment. In one case, melanocytes were seen admixed with
urothelial cells appreciated by S100 protein immunohis-
tochemical stain, but not in the H&E sections [2]. No
nuclear atypia or melanoma was identified in any of the
described patients (Additional file 1).
Melanin pigments should be differentiated from lipofus-
cin and hemosiderin deposits. Lipofuscin deposits are
referred to as lipofuscinosis or pseudomelanosis in order
to separate them from true melanosis (melanin deposits).
Lipofuscin forms brown fine granules usually perinuclear
located, representing undigested material from lipid per-
oxidation and associated with aging. It is positive by PAS
stain, negative by Fontana Mason and iron stains, and
does not disappear after bleaching procedure (bleaching
resistant). Lipofuscinosis of the urinary bladder has been
reported in a patient with interstitial cystitis after long
term treatment with ciprofloxacin [5]. The urinary bladder
showed scattered brownish discolorations under cysto-
scopic examination and the histological sections showed
pigment granules in the urothelial cells and in the lamina
propria histocytes. The pigment was PAS positive and
bleach resistant. It was speculated that administration of
ciprofloxacin might be the underlying cause of urinary
lipofuscinosis due to free radicals generated by metabo-
lism of ciprofloxacin. Lipofuscinosis of the urinary blad-
der have been also reported in patients with phenacetin
abuse [6], which interestingly, also promote generation of
free radicals during metabolism.

Comparing to lipofuscin deposit in the urinary bladder,
lipofusion deposit is more commonly encountered in the
colonic biopsy specimen as melanosis coli and are usually
associated with anthracene containing laxative or herbal
remedies usage. The colonic mucosa usually shows brown
discoloration under colonoscopy examination, and histo-
logically, it shows pigmented macrophages in the lamina
propria. The term of melanosis coli is misleading, because
the pigments are not melanin at all [7]. In this situation,
the term pseudomelanosis coli or lipofuscinosis coli may
be more appropriate to reflect the etiology of the colonic
pigmentation.
Hemosiderin is an intracellular storage form of iron that
is produced by phagocytic digestion of hematin. They
appear as a golden yellow-brown intracellular or extracel-
lular pigment under light microscopic examination, and
pigments are positive by Gomori's or other iron stains.
The excessive iron storage in tissue is known as hemosi-
derosis. Hemosiderosis of urinary bladder was reported in
a man with multiple blood transfusions as part of treat-
ment for his anaplastic anemia. Cystoscopic examination
showed a brown black 2.0 cm polypoid lesion on the right
lateral wall and surrounding numerous smaller lesions of
similar appearance. Histologically, the urothelial mucosa
showed prominent hemosiderin deposits and hemosi-
derin-laden macrophages in the lamina propria with
unremarkable urothelium [8]. Although hemosiderin is
mostly present in the stroma and macrophages, but not in
the urothelial cells, it still should be included in the differ-
ential diagnosis for complete work up.
Most importantly, urinary melanosis needs to be differen-
tiated from melanoma, which is also extremely rare in the
urinary bladder, and classified as primary or metastatic,
based on patient's clinical presentation and the presence
or absence of atypical melanocytes in the urothelium [9].
In the absence of cutaneous or other visceral melanoma
and the presence of atypical melanocytes in the urothe-
lium adjacent to melanoma, the tumor is classified as pri-
mary. In a case report of primary melanoma of the urinary
bladder, the patient had gross hematuria for four months
and black mass lesions of the urinary bladder were seen
under cystoscopic examination. The histology sections
showed spindle and epithelioid heavily pigmented malig-
nant melanocytes with high mitotic rate. Atypical melano-
cytes were also present in the urothelium [10]. The tumor
cells were positive for S100 protein and HMB45. There-
fore, being aware of clinical history, carefully reviewing
histological features and performing necessary immuno-
histochemical stains, are very important in making the
correct diagnosis. Urinary bladder melanosis is a benign
condition of unknown clinical significance. One patient
has been followed up for ten years and shows no develop-
ment of malignancy [11].
Patients with melanosis, lipofucinosis, hemosiderosis, or
even melanoma of the urinary bladder, can have similar
non-specific symptoms such as hematuria, cystitis, diffi-
culty voiding, or urinary incontinence. Under the cysto-
scopic examination, all show pigmented lesions, although
melanoma may have associated mass. Histological exam-
ination is the most important way to accurately classify
the pigmented lesions in the urinary bladder.
Melanosis of the skin or oral mucosa has been thoroughly
studied because it is common. It can be seen in many con-
ditions and is related to sun exposure (skin) or trauma
(mucosa). It appears as gray or black macules. Histologi-
cally, it shows melanin deposits in the basal layer of the
squamous epithelium. Melanosis of oral mucosa can also
be seen in smokers and in patients with Peutz-Jeghers syn-
drome [12].
Unlike melanosis of the skin and oral mucosa, the under-
lying etiology of urinary melanosis is not yet established.
Since no melanocytes are normally present in the urothe-
lium or metaplastic epithelium, melanocyte ectopia has
been speculated for the primary melanoma of urinary
bladder [9], which may also apply to the development of
urinary melanosis.
Conclusion
Urinary melanosis is believed to be a benign lesion. Some
author proposed melanosis vesica [1] for this condition
and some just used the term of simple melanosis [2]. The
latter may be more appropriate to reflect the benign
nature of this condition. Careful review of histological
features, applying special stains including Fontana
Mason, iron, and PAS, bleach treatment, and immunohis-
tochemical stains for S100 protein and HMB45 will lead
to correct diagnosis. Treatment of the patient's underlying
conditions and close follow-up with annual cystoscopy is
recommended by some authors.
