Benzene: Epidemiologic Observations of
Leukemia by Cell Type and Adverse Health
Effects Associated with Low-Level Exposure
by Peter F. Infante* and Mary C. White*
Benzene has been known to be a bone marrow poison for almost a century. However, it
was not until the last decade that benzene's carcinogenic potential was demonstrated by
epidemiologic studies. The proposed regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) to lower exposure levels of benzene in the workplace, and the
court challenges that followed, have made the evidence of benzene toxicity a frequent
topic of discussion and analysis. Epidemiologic evidence ofleukemia risk associated with
benzene exposure is summarized, including a discussion of certain contentions raised
during the OSHA hearing. Special attention is given to information on specific cell types
of leukemia associated with benzene and to qualitative and quantitative assessments of
health risks associated with low-level benzene exposure.
Introduction
The commercial recovery of benzene from coal
tar was first developed in 1849. After its discov-
ery in 1876, coal gas became an important source
of benzene (1). Today, petroleum is the major
source ofbenzene production in the U.S., which in
1980 totaled almost 1.6 billion gallons (2).
For almost a century, exposure to benzene has
been associated with poisoning of the bone mar-
row or blood-forming organs. In 1897, one of the
earliest reports of benzene-related hematologic
disorders was published in Paris (3). In 1928, a
clearly established diagnosis of acute leukemia
was reported in a worker who had been exposed to
benzene for 5 years (4). Although hundreds of
case reports of aplastic anemia and leukemia
were subsequently diagnosed among workers ex-
posed to benzene, it was not until the 1970s that
epidemiologic mortality studies of benzene-ex-
posed populations were reported.
Epidemiologic Evidence since
1976
The first epidemiologic mortality study which
*Office of Carcinogen Identification and Classification,
Health Standards Programs, Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, Washington, DC 20210.
examined workers exposed specifically to benzene
was reported in 1977 (5, 6). Included in the cohort
were workers who had been occupationally ex-
posed to benzene in the production of Pliofilm, a
natural rubber film material, in two Ohio facili-
ties. All white males who had been employed in
Pliofilm production at any time between 1940 and
1949 and who were alive on January 1, 1950 were
studied. Person-years ofobservation and causes of
deaths were determined for the period January 1,
1950 to June 30, 1975.
With the follow-up more than 90% complete (6),
the investigators observed that seven cohort
members had died from leukemia. This number
was significantly in excess of the 1.25 expected,
based on age, calendar-time-period, and sex-spe-
cific U.S. general population death rates.
All seven leukemia deaths among benzene-ex-
posed workers were of either the myelogenous or
monocytic cell type. This observation was consist-
ent with earlier reports which had linked benzene
exposure with predominantly myelogenous leu-
kemia and its acute variants.
In order to generate an expected number of
leukemia deaths by cell type, Infante et al. (6)
applied age-specific death rates for acute and
monocytic leukemia, available from the National
Cancer Institute, to the person-year distribution
of the benzene-exposed cohort. Using these data,
the expected number of deaths from acute and
INFANTE AND WHITE
monocytic leukemia was calculated to be 0.70.
Compared to the six observed deaths in this cate-
gory, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of
857 was highly significant. This SMR is conserva-
tive for two reasons: (1) the rates used for deter-
mining the expected number included cell types
other than acute myelogenous and monocytic leu-
kemias, such as acute lymphatic leukemia, and
(2) a 29-year-old cohort member, whose cause of
death was listed as chronic myelogenous leuke-
mia and therefore not included in this analysis,
died within 2 years of his initial exposure to
benzene. Since there was such a short time inter-
val between initial exposure and death, it is possi-
ble that this individual may have died from acute
myelogenous leukemia.
At the time of the public hearings for the pro-
posed OSHA standard on benzene, several at-
tempts to discredit the study ofInfante et al. (5, 6)
surfaced. One argument contended that the
authors had merely discovered a cluster of leuke-
mia patients among a group ofworkers exposed to
benzene, and that similar leukemia clusters had
been observed previously among individuals not
exposed to benzene. However, the characteriza-
tion ofthese seven leukemia deaths as a cluster is
unusual, given the 12-year time span over which
they occurred. A cluster of a disease is typically
defined as a concentration of cases in one place
and at one point in time.
Another argument raised was that the leuke-
mia mortality ofthe two Pliofilm localities should
have been analyzed separately. Infante et al. (5)
combined workers from the two localities because
the Pliofilm operations were essentially identical.
Nevertheless, Tabershaw and Lamm (7) calcu-
lated crude leukemia death rates for each plant
by dividing the number ofleukemia deaths by the
total number of workers at each locality. Their
calculated crude death rates appear in Table 1.
They suggested that the difference in crude death
rates between locality A and B indicated that the
two subcohorts were not similar, and therefore
should not have been combined.
However, it is more appropriate to compare the
two subcohorts on the basis ofage-specific person-
years at risk, and not on the number of men
employed at each locality. As shown in Table 2,
Infante et al. (6) applied age-specific person-years
at risk to generate an expected number of leuke-
mia deaths for each locality. Although the num-
ber of workers employed at locality B was larger,
the number of expected leukemia deaths was
smaller. This was a reflection of the person-years
at risk being distributed over relatively younger
ages for workers employed at locality B as com-
pared to A, and the fact that leukemia mortality
rates generally increase with age. The resulting
SMRs for leukemia were 746 for locality A and
345 for locality B. This slight variation in excess
leukemia risk may be due to the small size of
these subcohorts, rather than to any real differ-
ence in risk between the two subcohorts.
Another epidemiologic study of benzene-ex-
posed workers, submitted into the OSHA Record,
also showed an excess of leukemia. Ott and his
associates (8) studied workers who were exposed
to benzene, at anytime between 1940 and 1970, in
three chemical production areas of a Michigan
plant. The vital status ofthese workers was deter-
mined through 1973, and follow-up was more
than 90% complete. The researchers discovered
that three cohort members had developed leuke-
mia. This incidence was significantly (p < 0.047)
in excess of the expected number for nonlympho-
cytic leukemia, which had been generated by
using morbidity data from the Third National
Cancer Survey.
All three leukemia cases were myelocytic and
two were acute myelocytic leukemia. In addition,
Ott et al. (8) characterized the levels of benzene-
exposure for all three workers with leukemia as
being below a time-weighted average (TWA) con-
centration of 10 ppm.
Other Studies of Benzene
Exposure and Leukemia
Thorpe (9) conducted a survey of leukemia
deaths among 38,000 workers employed in petro-

BENZENE, LEUKEMIA BY CELL TYPE AND LOW LEVEL ADVERSE EFFECTS
leum refining and petrochemical plants in eight
European countries. Benzene was known to have
been present in some operations. Eighteen deaths
from leukemia were reported to have occurred
between 1962 and 1971. Thorpe compared this
number to an expected number of 23.23 leukemia
deaths and concluded that no excess in leukemia
mortality could be demonstrated among these
employees.
However, this study cannot be used to assess
the relationship between benzene exposure in the
petroleum industry and leukemia due to a num-
ber of methodologic deficiencies, some of which
follow. The age breakdown for the entire popula-
tion was unobtainable and had to be estimated
from the age distribution of one company's work
force. The mortality rates used to generate the
expected number of leukemia deaths reflect an
average mortality experience of only some of the
eight countries included. Many companies had no
mechanism which assured that the death of a
worker or the cause of death would be reported to
the company, and therefore an unknown number
of deaths were missing from the analysis. No
verification of cause of death or of diagnosis of
leukemia was available. Infrequent monitoring
and incomplete occupational histories made it
difficult to distinguish persons exposed to benzene
from those not exposed. Nevertheless, this study
continues to be cited as evidence of a threshold
level for the induction of leukemia among work-
ers exposed to benzene (10).
In contrast to Thorpe's study, which failed to
detect an excess leukemia risk among European
workers in the petroleum industry, recent studies
of U.S. refinery workers have demonstrated ex-
cesses in mortality from cancer of the lymphatic
and hematopoietic systems. Exposure to benzene
in the petroleum industry is believed to be rela-
tively low. Brief et al. (11) estimated that in
petroleum refineries, the probability of benzene
levels exceeding 1 ppm TWA is less than 5%, and
in petrochemical plants, the probability of ben-
zene levels exceeding 5 ppm TWA is less than 8%.
The results of one study, shown in Table 3,
demonstrate a significant excess of leukemia for
white males employed for 15 years or more in a
Texas refinery (12). In the same report, analyses
were also performed on a restricted group of
workers with known exposure to benzene. To
date, no leukemia deaths have been observed
among a subcohort of workers employed directly
on the benzene, ethylene, aromatic distillate hy-
drogenation or cumene units. However, as indi-
cated by the author, the statistical power to detect
an excess in leukemia as large as 19-fold in this

subcohort was only 50% at an a value of 0.05.
A study ofunion employees in three U.S. petro-
leum refining and petrochemical plants also has
suggested that these workers may be at an ele-
vated risk ofcertain cancers, including leukemia.
The risk of dying from leukemia increased with
increased length of union membership (13). In
addition, more recent analyses demonstrate a sig-
nificantly elevated risk ofdying from leukemia in
two of the three refineries studied (Thomas, per-
sonal communication).
Schottenfeld (14) recently reported an excess in
leukemia incidence among petroleum refinery
workers. The excess in the incidence of the total
leukemia was not statistically significant (11 ob-
served vs. 7.56 expected), but the excess in the
incidence of specifically lymphocytic leukemia
was significant (7 observed vs. 2.56 expected, p =
0.03).
Cell Types of Leukemia
Associated with Benzene
Acute myelogenous leukemia is the form of
leukemia that has been reported most frequently
among persons exposed to benzene (15). However,
it should be noted that other types of leukemia
have also been associated with benzene exposure.
Browning (16) searched the literature and found
61 reported cases of leukemia among persons
exposed to benzene, with the following distribu-
tion of cell types: 6 acute myeloid, 1 subacute
myeloid, 21 chronic myeloid, 7 lymphatic, 14
aleukemic, and 12 erythroleukemic. Vigliani and
Forni (17) stated that 44 cases of leukemia had
been identified in persons with chronic benzene
exposure in Paris from 1950-1965; 23 cases were
classified as acute leukemia, 13 as chronic
myeloid leukemia, and 8 as chronic lymphocytic
leukemia.
77
INFANTE AND WHITE
In addition, Aksoy (18) recently reported his
observations on 42 leukemia patients with
chronic exposure to benzene in Turkey. The types
of leukemia reported included 16 acute
myeloblastic leukemia, 8 acute erythroleukemia,
7 preleukemia, 4 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 3
acute monocytic leukemia, 2 chronic myeloid leu-
kemia, and 1 each of acute promyelocytic leuke-
mia and acute undifferentiated leukemia.
The epidemiologic studies by Infante et al. (5, 6)
and Ott et al. (8) were of insufficient sample size
and therefore of inadequate statistical sensitivity
to detect excesses in types of leukemia that may
not demonstrate a risk as high as that for myelo-
monocytic leukemia. For example, the statistical
power of the Infante et al. (5, 6) study to detect a
twofold excess risk in types of leukemia other
than acute or monocytic leukemia (at the 0.05 ot
level) was only 0.10.
In 1976, NIOSH published a revised recommen-
dation for a more stringent occupational benzene
standard (19). NIOSH cited several epidemiologic
studies of rubber workers which demonstrated
excess numbers of deaths from neoplasms of the
lymphatic and hematopoietic systems, primarily
lymphatic leukemia. Benzene is known to have
been used extensively as a solvent in the rubber
industry. In one such study, McMichael et al. (20)
analzyed cancer deaths from 1964 to 1972 among
active or retired male hourly workers at a rubber
plant in Akron, Ohio. These data are shown in
Table 4. Among the primarily active workers
(ages 40 to 64), eight deaths from lymphatic
leukemia were observed as compared to approxi-
mately one expected death; the SMR was 764.
These results may still underestimate the risk of
dying from leukemia as workers who may have
terminated from illnesses associated with leuke-
mia may not have been included in the study.
Among the primarily retired workers (ages 65 or
84), the risk of death from lymphatic leukemia
was about half of the expected. However, the
latter group is considered less sensitive for the
study of occupational cancer as it consists of es-
sentially a surviving population. Studies of vinyl
chloride (21) and asbestos (22, 23) workers have
clearly demonstrated this phenomenon.
A study conducted in 1977 and published re-
cently (24) concluded that the association be-
tween lymphatic leukemia and solvent exposure
in rubber workers was weaker than that reported
previously by McMichael (20). In this case-control
study (24), the odds ratios for individuals dying
from lymphatic leukemia were 3.2, 1.5 and 2.0 for
high, medium and low solvent exposure catego-
ries, respectively. However, a more recent study
of this same group of workers (25), using more
direct environmental measures, demonstrated
that the earlier association between lymphatic
leukemia and solvent exposure (20) was "not only
reaffirmed but was substantially strengthened."
Whereas McMichael (20) reported relative lym-
phatic leukemia risks up to 9 for workers in the
group presumed to have had high solvent expo-
sure, this study showed risk estimates of3.5 to 14
for workers exposed to benzene and 1.75 to 9.5 for
those in contact with other solvents.
It is noteworthy that of the six deaths among
refinery workers observed by Tabershaw (12), two
were from lymphatic leukemia. In the U.S.,
deaths from lymphatic leukemia account for ap-
proximately 30% of all leukemia deaths. Thus,
the expected number of deaths from specifically
lymphatic leukemia among workers employed for
15 years or more in the refinery would be consid-
erably smaller than the total expected number of
leukemia deaths, 1.58. Therefore, the risk of lym-
phatic leukemia may have been elevated among
these refinery workers.
The Risk of Adverse Health
Effects from Low-Level Exposure
to Benzene
It has been hypothesized by some that a thresh-
old level for benzene exposure exists below which

no adverse health effects would be expected to
occur. To date, there is no evidence to support the
existence of such a threshold. Two studies con-
ducted by researchers at the Dow Chemical Com-
pany suggest that adverse health effects can be
caused by exposure to benzene at average concen-
trations of less than 10 ppm. The first is the
epidemiologic study by Ott et al. (8), which re-
ported that all three workers who died from leu-
kemia had been exposed to benzene at TWA con-
centrations of less than 10 ppm.
A second study by Dow researchers demon-
strated a significant increase in structural chro-
mosomal aberrations in workers whose average
benzene exposures were below 10 ppm (26). These
findings were released shortly after the OSHA
Record for benzene was closed, and therefore were
not cited by OSHA in support of its proposed
standard.
Data from cytogenetic studies on 52 benzene-
exposed workers were compared with data from
44 pre-employment controls. The results showed
that the percentage ofworkers who had cells with
chromosome breaks was significantly greater for
the benzene-exposed group. Moreover, the per-
centage of workers who had both chromosome
breaks and marker chromosomes was ten times
higher among the benzene-exposed workers. A
later analysis of this same data by level of expo-
sure showed chromosomal damage at exposures
averaging below 2.5 ppm, as well as a dose-re-
sponse relationship between chromosomal dam-
age and benzene exposure level (27).
Because the controls were composed ofyounger
persons seeking employment, there was a discre-
pancy in the age composition of the control and
exposed groups. However, the results of large
population studies have shown that cytogenetic
breakage is not associated with age (28). An anal-
ysis of the distribution of benzene workers in this
study with both chromosome breaks and markers
showed no difference related to age (29).
In response to a request from OSHA, Dow sup-
plied supplemental information regarding the ex-
posure levels of the 52 benzene-exposed workers
included in this study (30). The submitted indus-
trial hygiene report states that sufficient data,
defined as one data point per person-year experi-
ence, were available to characterize exposures for
only 32 of the 52 individuals in the benzene-
exposed group. Personnel monitoring data from
1973 to 1976 showed that average 8-hr TWA
exposures ranged from less than 0.1 ppm to 7.4
ppm, with a maximum TWA observed for one job
classification of 18.3 ppm. Because thejob classifi-
cations that were selected for monitoring were
those where the estimated potential for benzene
exposure was greatest, it is possible that the
exposures for job classifications without monitor-
ing data, such as foreman and production super-
intendent, were less than those measured for
other job classifications. In addition, the report
states that 9 of the 52 examined workers were
employed in job classifications where they may
have been exposed to benzene at levels of 35 ppm
to 100 ppm for periods ofseveral minutes. It is not
stated, however, whether respirators were worn
during these operations. There is no evidence to
indicate that any of the remaining 43 workers
had ever been exposed to similar peak exposures.
In addition, 9 of the 52 workers had been previ-
ously employed in another ethylbenzene plant,
but no exposure data were provided for that plant.
Court Challenges of OSHA
Standard
In July 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld
an earlier decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit to vacate the revised OSHA
standard for occupational exposure to benzene
(31). In the earlier decision, the lower court did
not disagree with OSHA's factual findings that
benzene causes leukemia and that there exists no
known safe level for benzene exposure. Instead,
the lower court stated that "until OSHA can
provide substantial evidence that the benefits to
be achieved by reducing the permissible exposure
limit from 10 ppm to 1 ppm bear a reasonable
relationship to the costs imposed by the reduc-
tion, it cannot show that the standard is reasona-
bly necessary to provide safe or healthful work-
places" (32).
When the Supreme Court upheld the lower
court's decision, it did not challenge OSHA's sci-
entific determinations, nor did it address the cost-
benefit issue. A plurality ofjustices, in a split 5 to
4 decision, stated that OSHA had failed to make
the threshold finding that exposure to benzene at
the current standard is unsafe, in the sense that
significant risks are present and can be elimina-
ted or lessened by a change in practices. The
Supreme Court said that it was the agency's re-
sponsibility to determine what it considers to be a
"significant" risk, and that the requirement that
a "significant" risk be identified should not be
treated as a "mathematical straitjacket."
Because the revised OSHA standard was
stayed pending the outcome of the court chal-
lenges and then later vacated, it has never been
legally enforced. The standard that is currently in
effect (33) is the same as the standard originally
79
INFANTE AND WHITE
adopted in 1971, before benzene's leukemogenic
potential had been conclusively demonstrated.
The standard provides for an 8-hr TWA permissi-
ble exposure level of 10 ppm, with an acceptable
ceiling concentration of25 ppm. Excursions above
the ceiling are allowed to a maximum peak con-
centration not to exceed 50 ppm for more than 10
min in any 8-hr work period.
Quantitative Risk Assessment for
Benzene-lnduced Leukemia
In light of the recent U.S. Supreme Court deci-
sion, the available epidemiologic evidence for use
in a quantitative risk assessment has been evalu-
ated. As a first step, attention was focused on the
quantification of the risk of leukemia only, al-
though benzene also has been shown to induce
nonmalignant blood disorders, chromosomal ab-
errations and perhaps lymphomas. Only the stud-
ies by Infante et al. (5, 6) and Ott (8) were consid-
ered to have enough data on both exposure levels
and relative risk to be included in the risk assess-
ment.
Data on length and level ofbenzene exposure in
both studies indicated that there were differences
in exposure histories among the persons included
within each cohort. In order to take this variation
in exposure history into consideration, estimates
were made of the minimum and maximum aver-
age exposure experience of the cohorts included
in each study. Using this information, separate
risk assessments were performed assuming that
the exposure experience corresponded to either
the minimum or maximum estimate of exposure.
For example, in the Infante et al. (5) study, the
authors stated that the employee's benzene expo-
sure was generally well within the recommended
limits for that time. The calculation of the risk
assessment for this study was based on the expe-
rierice of cohort members with 5 years of work
experience or more as presented in the recent
update (34) of the Infante et al. study (5 observed
leukemia deaths versus 0.23 expected SMR =
2100). Individuals with less than 5 years of em-
ployment (2 observed leukemia deaths versus
1.02 expected SMR = 200) were not included
because the excess was not statistically signifi-
cant. Because these individuals averaged about
0.5 years of employment, the inclusion of these
data in the calculation would not have apprecia-
bly altered the results. For those with 5 years of
employment or more, we made two assumptions:
first, they were exposed for 5 years to the esti-
mates of average benzene exposure between
1937-54; second, they were exposed for 30 years
to average benzene exposure between 1937-75.
[See recent report by White et al. for more details
(35).] The true risk is thought to probably fall
within the range expressed by these two risk
estimates.
Since dose-response data were not available,
the one-hit model was used to estimate the excess
leukemia risk which could result from a working
lifetime exposure (assumed to be 45 years) at the
current (10 ppm) and proposed (1 ppm) permissi-
ble exposure levels. The number of excess leuke-
mia deaths estimated to result from 45 years of
exposure at 10 ppm was 44 to 152 per 1000
exposed workers. The same length ofemployment
at 1 ppm was estimated to result in 5 to 16 excess
leukemia deaths per 1000 exposed workers.
A similar approach was used for the data avail-
able from the Ott et al. (8) study. For 45 years at
10 ppm, the excess number ofmyelogenous leuke-
mia deaths was estimated to be 48 to 136.3 per
1000 exposed workers. The corresponding esti-
mates for 45 years at 1 ppm were 5 to 15 per 1000
exposed workers. Because any risk assessment is
attended by a great deal of uncertainty, these
figures should be interpreted with caution.
Benzene as a Current Problem in
the Workplace
Although benzene toxicity has been studied
and analyzed for almost 100 years, workers are
still being injured and dying from exposure to
benzene. In 1980, a 40-year-old black male in
Baltimore, Maryland, was killed from acute ben-
zene intoxication after he entered a tank where
benzene fumes were known to be present (36).
The worker obviously was not afforded appropri-
ate respiratory protection. Permanent workers at
the plant refused to enter the storage tank be-
cause of the known hazards of benzene exposure.
As a result, this worker was hired from a tempo-
rary employment agency to enter the tank. He
died after a few hours of exposure to benzene.
Reports received by OSHA indicate that ben-
zene is also a continuing health problem at rela-
tively low levels of exposure. For example, in
1976, a 24-year-old white male developed aplastic
anemia after working for a few months at a gas
station. The only exposure he had had to any
agent known to cause aplastic anemia in humans
was benzene. His exposure to benzene resulted
from the inhalation of gasoline fumes which con-
tained benzene and also possibly from the absorp-
tion ofbenzene in gasoline through the skin. The
worker splashed gasoline onto his hands and
80
BENZENE, LEUKEMIA BY CELL TYPE AND LOW LEVEL ADVERSE EFFECTS 81
arms, and his clothing frequently became soaked
with gasoline.
Since atmospheric exposure to benzene fumes
from pumping gasoline at service stations is
known to result in atmospheric levels ranging
from 0.17 to 6.59 ppm, with overall 6 to 8 hr TWA
values averaging 0.1 ppm (37), the aplastic ane-
mia may have resulted from very low level inha-
lation exposure.
It is also possible that some benzene was ab-
sorbed through the skin. Maibach (38) has re-
cently reported the preliminary results of paint-
ing radiolabeled-14 C-benzene on the forearm and
palm of human volunteers. Penetration of ben-
zene ranged from an average of 0.06% of the dose
when applied to the forearm of 0.13% when ap-
plied to the hand. Abraded skin or prolonged
contact with skin would allow the penetration ofa
relatively greater amount ofbenzene.
In another instance, a 30-year-old instructor
developed acute myelocytic leukemia 3 years af-
ter demonstrating a laboratory procedure which
used benzene as a solvent. His average time of
exposure to benzene was 3 hr every 1 to 2 weeks
over the course of 18 months.
Conclusions
Information presented in the report leads us to
the following conclusions: epidemiologic studies
of workers exposed specifically to benzene have
been too insensitive to determine the risk of
death from cell types of leukemia that may have
risk ratios of less than 5.0; case series suggest an
association of chronic leukemia, including lym-
phatic leukemia, and benzene; recent studies of
U.S. refinery workers, who may experience low-
level benzene exposure, demonstrate excesses of
leukemia, including lymphatic leukemia; work-
ers employed in the rubber industry, where ben-
zene had been used as the main solvent, demon-
strate an excess of lymphatic leukemia. With
regard to adverse effects resulting from low level
atmospheric exposure to benzene: one epidemio-
logic study has demonstrated a significant excess
of leukemia among workers exposed to TWA con-
centrations of benzene below 10 ppm; cytogenetic
damage has been demonstrated among workers
exposed to benzene concentrations below 10 ppm;
a quantitative risk assessment demonstrates a
significant leukemia risk at the 10 ppm exposure
level for 45 years, ranging somewhere between
44 and 152 leukemia deaths per 1000 workers
exposed; and finally, the excess risk at 1 ppm for
45 years is estimated to range somewhere be-
tween 5 and 16 leukemia deaths per 100 exposed
