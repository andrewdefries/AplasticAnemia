INTRODUCTION
Drug-induced neutropenia (DIN) is a rare, sporadic, and
transient disorder. The patients with DIN experience a high
rate of infectious complications and have a mortality rate of
approximately 10% (1, 2). The most common drugs associ-
ated with DIN are antithyroidal drugs, anticonvulsants, and
antibiotics such as cephalosporins, penicillins, sulfonamides,
and chloramphenicol, although the pathogenesis of DIN is
poorly understood (3).
Here, we describe the brief history of a child with pneu-
mococcal pneumonia, who experienced severe neutropenia
during antibiotic treatment and in whom we detected 4 kinds
of antibiotic-dependent antineutrophil antibodies.
CASE REPORT
A 22-month-old boy presented to another hospital with
fever and cough for 3 days. On admission to our institution,
he was irritable and dyspneic. Physical examinations revealed
markedly decreased breathing sounds over the left lung fields.
The radiologic findings showed diffuse infiltration in the left
lower lung fields without shifting of pleural fluid. Laboratory
studies on admission disclosed the following values: hemo-
globin 11.2 gm/dL, white blood cell (WBC) 9,800/μL (dif-
ferential count; segmented neutrophil 82.6%, lymphocyte
14.8%, monocyte 2.6%), platelet 281,000/μL, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) 55 mm/hr, C-reactive protein (CRP)
32.2 mg/dL. We started antibiotics with augmentin (100 mg/
kg/day, intravenously) and tobramycin (5 mg/kg/day, intra-
venously) as well as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, 1
gm/kg) after septic workup including blood cultures. Three
days later, we switched antibiotics to vancomycin (50 mg/kg/
day, intravenously), cefotaxim (200 mg/kg/day, intravenous-
ly), and roxithromycin (8 mg/kg/day, orally) because the blood
culture revealed Streptococcus pneumoniae being sensitive to van-
comycin and the antibody titer for Mycoplasma pneumoniae was
1:160 even with a negative cold agglutinin test. His clinical
condition became well without fever after 8 days of antibi-
otic therapy.
On hospital day 12, before which it was not evident, fluid
shifting on a chest radiography was detected and also con-
firmed by chest computed tomograohy (CT) scans. A chest
tube was inserted and pleural fluid analysis showed compat-
ible findings with transudate, possibly due to previous antibi-

Antibiotic-induced Severe Neutropenia with Multidrug-Dependent
Antineutrophil Antibodies Developed in A Child with Streptococcus
pneumoniae Infection
Drug-induced neutropenia (DIN), particularly that in which antibiotic-dependent an-
tineutrophil antibodies have been detected, is a rare disorder. We report the case
of a child with pneumococcal pneumonia, who experienced severe neutropenia
during various antibiotic treatments. We detected 4 kinds (cefotaxim, augmentin,
vancomycin, and tobramycin) of antibiotic-dependent antineutrophil antibodies by
using the mixed passive hemagglutination assay (MPHA) technique with this child.

otic therapy. Furthermore, polymerase chain reactions for
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in pleu-
ral fluid were also negative. The serologic test for Mycoplas-
ma pneumoniae antibody was 1:160 and cold agglutinin test
was negative. The blood tests disclosed hemoglobin 6.2 g/dL,
WBC 18,500/μL (differential count; segmented neutrophil
62%, lymphocyte 35%, monocyte 3%), platelet 979,000/μL,
reticulocyte 2.3%, ESR 68 mm/hr, CRP 4.32 mg/dL. He
did not receive packed red blood cells (RBC) because of a pos-
itive direct Coombs test and warm antibody on the screen-
ing test. He received aspirin because of a high platelet count.
On hospital day 15, fever developed again and persisted
until hospital day 18, when progressive, generalized, erythe-
matous maculopapular rashes also appeared and a complete
blood count (CBC) revealed hemoglobin 7.8 g/dL, WBC
4,200/μL (differential count; segmented neutrophil 29%,
lymphocyte 59%, monocyte 9%, eosinophil 1%, atypical
lymphocyte 1%, myelocyte 1%), platelet 224,000/μL, and
reticulocyte 7.3%. Generalized skin rashes and edema were
aggravated until hospital day 22, when IVIG and solumedrol
was administered with replacement of vancomycin by same
doses of augmentin and tobramycin after removal of the chest
tube. Thereafter, the fever and skin rashes disappeared, even
the CBC findings on hospital day 26 showed severe neutrope-
nia (absolute neutrophil count: 492/μL).
On hospital day 32, the fever developed again without any
significant symptoms or signs. CBC findings on next day dis-
closed severe neutropenia with WBC 3,700/μL (differential
count; segmented neutrophil 1%, lymphocyte 91%, mono-
cyte 8%). Severe neutropenia persisted until withdrawal of
augmentin and tobramycin as well as administration of gran-
ulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, 5 mcg/kg/day, sub-
cutaneously) for 3 days from hospital day 36 when the blood
samples for antineutrophil antibodies were collected. The brief
clinical course as well as the changing pattern of absolute neu-
trophil counts is presented in Fig. 1.
To detect neutrophil antibody, we used the mixed passive
hemagglutination assay (MPHA), using extracted neutrophil
antigens coated onto microplates (4-6). Neutrophil antibody
IgG was detected in the patient’s serum. The serum was reac-
tive with the patient’s neutrophil but not with donors’ neu-
trophil (Fig. 2). Furthermore, positive control sera were reac-
tive with all donors’ neutrophil because human neutrophil
antigen (NA 1 and NA 2) are present in the all donors’ neu-
trophil including patient’s neutrophil, but patient’s own anti-
bodies did not have specificity for NA 1 and NA 2. The se-
rum was 1:8 positive with the patient's neutrophil. The serum
incubated with cefotaxim, augmentin, vancomycin, and to-
bramycin was positive (all 1:64) with the patient’s neutrophil,
but the serum incubated with aspirin and roxithromycin was
less reactive (1:4) with the patient’s neutrophil than the intact
serum (Fig. 3). The serum coincubated with drugs was not
reactive with any of the donor’s neutrophils (Fig. 4). In con-
clusion, there was an anti-neutrophil autoantibody that had
specificity for antibiotics (cefotaxim, augmentin, vancomycin,
and tobramycin).
DISCUSSION
DIN is an idiosyncratic reaction that is mediated by im-
mune or allergic and toxic mechanisms, and results in pro-
found neutropenia (7). Although antineutrophil antibodies
also appear in a range of diseases associated with neutrope-

nia, such as pure white blood cell aplasia, immune neutrope-
nia, Felty’s syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus,
antineutrophil antibodies have been detected in most of the
cases of antibodies to autologous or normal granulocytes in
immune-mediated DIN (8). In DIN, antibody binding to a
target cell usually requires the presence of the causative drug
and the complement is often consumed (9). Other mecha-
nisms, involving cytotoxic T cells, haptens, autoimmunity
and oxidative modifications of drugs as well as direct dam-
age to myeloid precursors have been reported (10-13).
The causes of neutropenia include infectious diseases (espe-
cially viral), exposure to chemicals, nutritional deficiencies,
immune disorders, and congenital or chronic neutropenia (7).
However, most, but not all, instances of neutropenia result
from exposure to drugs, and either the drug itself or a metabo-
lite may be causative (3). The annual incidence of symptomat-
ic nonchemotherapy DIN is between 2.4 and 15.4 cases per
million people per year (7). This incidence increases with age,
as only 10% of cases are reported in children and young adults
and more than half of these episodes occur in people aged over
60 yr (14).
The drugs most commonly associated with neutropenia
are antibiotics (particularly beta-lactam and trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxasole) as well as antithyroid drugs, antiplatelet
agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and norami-
dopyrin (3). We experienced a case of DIN in a child in whom
was detected antineutrophil antibodes by MPHA technique
to 4 kinds of antibiotics, but not to roxithromycin and acetyl-
salicylic acid. Even if it is not usual to detect antibodies simul-
taneously for 4 kinds of antibiotics, we could not try to con-
firm the basic mechanism with further studies. In this child,
fever and allergic skin reactions developed respectively at 17
days, 10 days prior to neutropenia, which suggested a van-
comycin induced drug reaction. Our patient also showed low
hemoglobin level at 20 days prior to detection of severe neu-
tropenia, which could be considered to be immune mediat-
ed hemolytic anemia. However, we could not find laboratory
evidence of hemolysis except from the positive direct Coombs
test, which was considered to be the effect of previous admin-
istration of intravenous immunoglobulin. We believed that
the decreased hemoglobin level was caused by the suppression
of bone marrow function due to severe infection, although
we did not perform bone marrow examinations, and even-
tually the decreased hemoglobin level was normalized with-
out transfusion in accordance with the control of infection.
In conclusion, we could suggest that neutropenia occurred
in this patient was mediated by autoantibodies to antibiotics,
based on the immune mediated clinical findings which show-
ed prior to detection of antineutrophil antibodies in patient’s
serum. Thus we report this patient with DIN presenting an-
tineutrophil antibodies to antibiotics.
