NA molecules fulﬁll a diverse set of biological
functions within cells, from the transfer of genetic
information from DNA to protein, to enzymatic
catalysis. Reﬂecting this range of roles, simple linear
strings of RNA—made up of uracil, guanine, cytosine, and
adenine—form a variety of complex three-dimensional
structures. Just as proteins form distinct structural motifs
such as zinc ﬁngers and beta barrels, certain structures are
also commonly adopted by RNA molecules. Among the most
prevalent RNA structures is a motif known as the pseudoknot.
First recognized in the turnip yellow mosaic virus [1], a
pseudoknot is an RNA structure that is minimally composed
of two helical segments connected by single-stranded regions
or loops (Figure 1). Although several distinct folding
topologies of pseudoknots exist, the best characterized is the
H type. In the H-type fold, the bases in the loop of a hairpin
form intramolecular pairs with bases outside of the stem
(Figure 1A and 1B). This causes the formation of a second
stem and loop, resulting in a pseudoknot with two stems
and two loops (Figure 1C). The two stems are able to stack
on top of each other to form a quasi-continuous helix with
one continuous and one discontinuous strand. The single-
stranded loop regions often interact with the adjacent stems
(loop 1–stem 2 or loop 2–stem 1) to form hydrogen bonds
and to participate in the overall structure of the molecule.
Hence, this relatively simple fold can yield very complex and
stable RNA structures. Due to variation of the lengths of the
loops and stems, as well as the types of interactions between
them, pseudoknots represent a structurally diverse group. It
is ﬁtting that they play a variety of diverse roles in biology.
These roles include forming the catalytic core of various
ribozymes [2,3], self-splicing introns [4], and telomerase [5].
Additionally, pseudoknots play critical roles in altering gene
expression by inducing ribosomal frameshifting in many
viruses [6–9].
Catalytically Active Pseudoknots
Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a satellite virus of hepatitis B
virus. Infection of humans by both HDV and hepatitis B virus
is generally more severe than a hepatitis B virus infection
alone [10]. HDV has a circular genome that is replicated by
the host RNA polymerase II through a double-rolling-circle
mechanism. This mechanism produces long strands of RNA
that must be processed into unit lengths for viral replication.
The processing of the viral RNA is achieved by the self-
cleaving HDV ribozyme encoded in the RNA [11]. The HDV
ribozyme folds into a double-pseudoknot conformation and
self-cleaves, producing single-genome-length HDV RNAs. The
HDV ribozyme is the fastest-known naturally occurring self-
cleaving ribozyme, with a cleavage rate greater than one per
second, and is active in vitro in the absence of any proteins
[12]. The HDV ribozyme consists of ﬁve helical segments that
form two coaxial stacks of two (stems P2 and P3) and three
(stems P1, P1.1, and P4) helices each (Figure 2A) [3,13].
Two pseudoknots are formed, each with one helix from
each coaxial stack (stems P1 and P2, and stems P3 and P1.1).
These two pseudoknots stack on top of each other, forming a
nested double-pseudoknot conformation [13].
The removal of introns from pre–messenger RNA (pre-
mRNA) is fundamentally important for eukaryotic life.
Most introns are removed by a ribonucleoprotein complex
called the spliceosome. A subset of introns are self-cleaving,
catalyzing their own removal from pre-mRNA without the aid
of proteins [14]. One such class of introns are the group I

self-splicing introns, with the most well-studied example being
from the ciliate Tetrahymena. The structure of this ribozyme is
made up of three helical domains, with many tertiary contacts
between the domains [15]. The only portion of the RNA
that spans all three helical domains is a pseudoknot belt that
wraps around the molecule, base-pairing with all three helices
[15]. The pseudoknot establishes the catalytic core of the
group I self-splicing introns.
Naturally occurring ribozymes appear to perform mainly
hydrolysis and transesteriﬁcation reactions [16]; however,
in vitro selection has yielded RNAs capable of performing
a wide variety of enzymatic reactions [17]. Recently the
structure of an RNA capable of catalyzing carbon–carbon
bond formation by the Diels-Alder reaction was solved
(Figure 2B) [18]. The RNA adopts a λ-shaped fold of its
three helices in which stems 2 and 3 stack coaxially, with
stem 1 abutting the active site, forming a pocket precisely
complementary to the reaction product. The 5′ end of the
RNA bridges helical stems 3 and 1, generating a complex
nested pseudoknot topology. Although conformationally
distinct from the HDV ribozyme [3], it is worthwhile to note
that they are two of the fastest-known ribozymes, and both
utilize a nested pseudoknot architecture [18].
Chromosomes possess protective ends known as telomeres
to protect themselves from degradation due to successive
rounds of DNA synthesis. Telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein
complex responsible for the maintenance of the telomere
ends [19], is upregulated in most cancers [20] and might
play a role in aging [21]. Human telomerase is made up of
a 451-nucleotide RNA, a reverse transcriptase, and other
proteins [22]. At the 5′ end of the RNA is a highly conserved
pseudoknot, required for activity, which lies at the core
of telomerase. The structure of the human telomerase
pseudoknot reveals a classic H-type pseudoknot fold with a
slight bend between the stems (Figure 2C) [5]. A triple-helix
structure ﬂanks the junction of the helices and extends into
each stem. Mutations within the telomerase pseudoknot have
been directly linked to the diseases autosomal dyskeratosis
congenita [21] and aplastic anemia [23].
Frameshift-Inducing Pseudoknots
Not all pseudoknots with biological functions are catalytically
active. In fact, one of the most common functions of
pseudoknots is to induce ribosomes to slip into alternative
reading frames, otherwise known as frameshifting. Ribosomes
typically translate mRNA without shifting the translational

reading frame [24]. However, a number of organisms have
evolved mechanisms to cause site-speciﬁc or programmed
frameshifting of the ribosome in either the +1 or −1 direction
[25]. Programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting is typically
found in viruses and is required for the replication and
proliferation of all retroviruses. Therefore, the pseudoknot
structures involved in frameshifting are attractive targets
for the development of antiviral drugs. The frameshift
event is induced by two RNA elements within the mRNA:
(i) a heptanucleotide slippery sequence X XXY YYZ
(spaced triplets represent preframeshift codons) and (ii)
a downstream RNA structure, typically a pseudoknot [26].
The mechanism behind how these elements promote −1
frameshifting is not fully understood. The current model
posits that the ribosome encounters the downstream
pseudoknot while the slippery sequence is being decoded
by the ribosome. The pseudoknot structure likely causes the
ribosome to pause, which is necessary but not sufﬁcient for
frameshifting to occur [27]. While paused on the slippery
sequence, the ribosome slips back one nucleotide and
subsequently continues translation in the −1 reading frame.
The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of the
mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) frameshift-inducing
pseudoknot was the ﬁrst structure of a frameshift-inducing
pseudoknot (Figure 2D) [6]. The MMTV pseudoknot forms
a compact structure of two guanine/cytosine-rich A-form
helices. The MMTV pseudoknot has a bend of approximately
60º between the two helices, caused by an unpaired adenine
that intercalates between the helices and may act as a hinge.
Subsequent structural and functional studies of several
variants of the MMTV pseudoknot reveal that the intercalated
nucleotide and the resulting bend between stems 1 and 2 are
required for efﬁcient frameshifting [28].
In beet western yellow virus, pea enation mosaic virus, and
other luteoviruses, an RNA pseudoknot also stimulates a −1
frameshift between the P1 and P2 genes [29]. These structures,
solved by X-ray crystallography and NMR, respectively, revealed
compact H-type pseudoknots with extensive loop–stem
interactions (Figure 2E) [7,9]. Like that of MMTV, frameshift-
inducing pseudoknots in both the beet western yellow virus
and pea enation mosaic virus have an unpaired nucleotide at
the junction of the stems; however, this nucleotide is displaced
from the helix, not intercalated as in MMTV.
The frameshift-inducing pseudoknot from simian retrovirus
1 contains a number of unique features (Figure 2F) [8].
Although predicted to resemble that of MMTV, with an
unpaired adenine between the helices, the structure revealed
the formation of a uracil–adenine pair at the junction,
allowing the two stems to stack directly on top of each
other (Figure 2F) [8]. The simian retrovirus 1 pseudoknot
forms an extensive loop 2–stem 1 triplex, which contains a
ribose zipper motif in addition to base–base and base–sugar
interactions [8].
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-
CoV) genome contains two large genes, ORF 1a and ORF 1b,
separated by a programmed −1 frameshift element required
for ORF 1b expression [30]. Recent work has suggested
that the SARS-CoV frameshift-inducing pseudoknot may be
unique because it contains a third stem–loop [31,32]. In
this issue of PLoS Biology, bioinformatic, phylogenetic, and
structural evidence is reported indicating that the SARS-CoV
pseudoknot is indeed a three-stemmed RNA pseudoknot (see
Figure 1D) [33]. Dinman and co-workers report the potential
for the formation of this three-stemmed pseudoknot in all
coronaviruses in the GenBank database. NMR experiments
conﬁrmed the proposed three-stemmed pseudoknot structure
in SARS-CoV. Although the atomic-resolution structure
has not yet been determined, this study identiﬁes a new
secondary structure capable of promoting frameshifting that
is structurally distinct from previously described pseudoknots
(see Figure 1D).
RNA pseudoknots have been identiﬁed in nearly every
organism and comprise functional domains within ribozymes,
self-splicing introns, ribonucleoprotein complexes, viral
genomes, and many other biological systems. It is clear
that the pseudoknot topology can result in many different,
complex structures. The pseudoknot, therefore, represents
an important piece of RNA architecture, as it provides a
means for a single RNA strand to fold upon itself to produce
a globular structure capable of performing important
biological functions.
