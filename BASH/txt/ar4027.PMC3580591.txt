Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia (ICL) was described in
1992 as an immunodeﬁciency syndrome characterized by
opportunistic infections and low CD4 T-cell counts in
the absence of HIV infection. Despite the 20 years that
have elapsed, the clinical spectrum, pathogenesis, and
possible treatment for ICL remain obscure. Here, we
attempt to summarize the salient features of this
condition on the basis of the available literature to date.
Definition
ICL is deﬁned by a documented absolute CD4 T lympho-
cyte count of less than 300 cells per cubic millimeter or of
less than 20% of total T cells on more than one occasion,
usually 2 to 3  months apart, without evidence of HIV
infection or any deﬁned immunodeﬁciency or therapy
associated with depressed levels of CD4 T cells.
Pathogenesis
ICL is a condition of unknown etiology and is considered
a heterogenous syndrome possibly encompassing diﬀer-
ent disorders sharing the common feature of reduced
circulating CD4 T-cell counts. In that respect, it is no
surprise that no uniform theory for the pathogenesis of
ICL has been formalized. In this review, we attempt to
summarize the most important reports of possible
pathogenetic mechanisms and immunologic abnormali-
ties in ICL.
The failure of CD4 T-cell homeostasis in ICL could be
attributed to decreased production, increased destruc-
tion, tissue sequestration, or any combination of these.
Evidence supporting each of these explanations has been
reported, although in some studies it is not possible to
decipher whether the ﬁndings relate to the cause of ICL
or are consequences of the lymphopenia itself. Finally,
three recent distinct genetic abnormalities have been
Abstract
Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia (ICL) is a presumed heterogenous syndrome with key element low CD4 T-cell
counts (below 300/mm3
) without evidence of HIV infection or other known immunodeficiency. The etiology,
pathogenesis, and management of ICL remain poorly understood and inadequately defined. The clinical presentation
can range from serious opportunistic infections to incidentally diagnosed asymptomatic individuals. Cryptococcal
and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy are the most
significant presenting infections, although the spectrum of opportunistic diseases can be similar to that in patients
with lymphopenia and HIV infection. Malignancy is common and related to opportunistic pathogens with an
oncogenic potential. Autoimmune diseases are also seen in ICL with an increased incidence. The etiology of ICL is
unknown. Mechanisms implicated in CD4 reduction may include decreased production, increased destruction, and
tissue sequestration. New distinct genetic defects have been identified in certain patients with ICL, supporting the
hypothesis of the lack of a common etiology in this syndrome. The management of ICL is focused on the treatment
of opportunistic infections, appropriate prophylactic antibiotics, and close monitoring. In selected patients with
life-threatening infections or profound immunodeficiency, strategies to increase T-cell counts or enhance immune
function could be considered and have included interleukin-2, interferon-gamma, interleukin-7, and hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation. The prognosis is influenced by the accompanying opportunistic infections and may be
affected by publication bias of severe cases with unfavorable outcomes. As newer laboratory investigation techniques
are being developed and targeted experimental treatments become available, our comprehension and prognosis of
this rare syndrome could be significantly improved.

identiﬁed, although familial ICL cases were not seen in
our cohort and have otherwise been very rare [1,2].
In terms of decreased CD4 T-cell production, decreased
bone marrow clonogenic capability with diminished stem
cell precursors contributing to CD4 depletion has been
described in three relevant studies [3]. Reduction of p56
(Lck) kinase activity in ICL patients’ T  cells compared
with healthy control donors was observed in another
study, emphasizing the critical role of this kinase in the
maintenance of the peripheral CD4 T-cell subset [4].
Disturbed thymic T-cell maturation was ﬁnally impli-
cated in ICL pathogenesis in another study [5].
In terms of increased CD4 T-cell destruction, one of
the initial reports dealing with ICL pathogenesis
demonstrated enhanced apoptotic depletion of CD4
T cells [6], possibly associated with overexpression of Fas
and Fas ligand [7]. In our large cohort of ICL cases, we
described increased activation and cycling of CD4
T cells, which were inversely correlated with CD4 T-cell
numbers, suggesting a compensatory response to lympho-
penia [8]. In another report, we demonstrated that CD4
cycling was strongly associated with levels of plasma
lipopolysaccharide [9], implying a possible association of
microbial products with lymphopenia-induced prolifera-
tion. High serum interleukin 7 (IL-7) levels as well as an
inverse correlation of CD4 count and IL-7 levels have
been described in ICL [3,10,11]. The high IL-7 levels
possibly represent cytokine accumulation [12] due to
decreased IL-7 receptor alpha chain expression on T cells
(CD127) [8,9]. This is supported by the fact that IL-7
levels do not correlate with T-cell cycling and inversely
correlate with in vitro CD4 T-cell responses to IL-7 as
measured by STAT-5 phosphorylation [13]. Speciﬁcally,
lower levels of STAT-5 phosphorylation after IL-7
stimulation were observed in both CD4 and CD8 T cells
from ICL patients compared with controls. In addition,
destabilization of p27kip1
, a critical step for IL-7-induced
T-cell cycling, was decreased in ICL patients compared
with controls after in vitro IL-7 stimulation. These data
suggest that high serum IL-7 levels do not necessarily
represent a compensatory response and that the blunted
T-cell response to IL-7 may be further accentuating
T-cell apoptosis and lymphopenia. Autoantibodies to
CD4 T cells have also been reported in ICL [14] but with
no clear insight into the implications of this ﬁnding.
The low CD4 T-cell numbers and higher proportion of
memory-activated CD4 T  cells may lead to restricted
pathogen recognition in ICL. Alpha/beta and gamma/
delta T-cell repertoires of three patients with ICL were
reportedly highly restricted, giving rise to mono-/
oligoclonal T-cell expansions [15]. In addition, defective
production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) was seen in two patients with ICL
and cryptococcal meningitis [16], showing that functional
T-cell defects can be associated with presenting
infections.
T-cell traﬃcking and tissue distribution had not been
previously studied in ICL. In an immunodeﬁciency
syndrome characterized by warts, hypogammaglobulin-
emia, infections, and myelokathexis (WHIM), mutations
of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 leading to neutropenia
and immunodeﬁciency were identiﬁed [17]. In a recent
study that focused on chemokine receptor CXCR4 [18],
patients with ICL had very low to undetectable levels of
surface CXCR4 expression with intracellular accumu-
lation of CXCR4 and its ligand, CXCL12, in CD4 T cells
in comparison with healthy controls. Impaired CXCR4
expression was seen exclusively in T cells, both naïve and
memory subsets, and was restored after overnight rest. In
chemotaxis assays, it was shown that T  cells from
patients with ICL had impaired chemotactic responses to
CXCL12 and normal responses to CXCL8. There was
also a slower reemergence of CXCR4 after ligand binding
and internalization. In vivo IL-2 administration seemed
to restore CXCR4 expression and responses to CXCL12
in three out of four patients treated. This observation has
not yet been reproduced by other groups and should be
further explored. To date, our group has not found ICL
patients with absent CXCR4 expression on T  cells
(unpublished observations).
A genetic etiology in patients with ICL was identiﬁed in
three recent studies. The ﬁrst study [19] described two
novel missense mutations in RAG1 gene related to a mild
clinical ICL phenotype in a girl. RAG1 or RAG2 muta-
tions have been responsible for the majority of patients
with severe combined immunodeﬁciency of the T-B-
SCID phenotype as well as for the Omenn syndrome
[19]. It is consequently concluded that RAG mutations
can be responsible for clinical presentations spanning
from severe immunodeﬁciencies to an almost normal
phenotype, as seen in this patient with ICL.
The second study [1] implicated mutations in the
magnesium transporter gene, MAGT1, to an X-linked
primary human immunodeﬁciency with impaired thymic
production of CD4 T cells and circulating T cells in two
brothers with ICL. This novel syndrome, XMEN
(X-linked immunodeﬁciency with magnesium defect,
Epstein virus infection and neoplasia), revealed a role for
Mg+
as an intracellular second messenger.
The third and most recent study [20] described a
heterozygous dominant negative missense mutation of
the signaling adaptor protein Uncoordinated 119
(Unc119) in a patient with ICL. The mutation disrupts
the Unc119-lymphocyte speciﬁc kinase (Lck) interaction
that is necessary for the T-cell response to T-cell receptor
(TCR) stimulation. In fact, there is impairment in both
localization and enzymatic activation of Lck. The patient
was a 32-year-old woman with ICL and recurrent otitis

media, shingles, widespread fungal nail infection, oral
herpetic lesions, and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing
pneumonia.
Clinical features
The diagnosis of ICL is typically suspected when an
opportunistic infection is identiﬁed in an otherwise
healthy individual. The literature is dominated by such
cases and is constantly expanding. The majority of cases
report opportunistic infections – most notably crypto-
coccal or mycobacterial disease and progressive multi-
focal leukoencephalopathy (PML) – that are normally
seen in HIV-infected patients. The detailed listing of all
reported infections exceeds the scope and purpose of this
review and has been summarized eﬀectively elsewhere
[21,22]. It is possible that the apparent presenting clinical
spectrum of ICL is inﬂuenced by publication bias of more
serious infections and adverse outcomes. In that respect,
our longitudinal study of 39 patients with ICL [8] oﬀers
some insight into the incidence of infections and other
complications (namely autoimmune disease and
malignancy) during a median follow-up period of 49
months. In this study, the three most common infections
at presentation were cryptococcal, genital human
papilloma virus (HPV), and non-tuberculous mycobac-
terial infections. As described extensively in the available
literature [23], cryptococcal infections were mainly, but
not exclusively, pulmonary or central nervous system
disease. Human papilloma virus infections were, notably,
treatment-resistant or locally spread with or without
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Most non-tuberculous
mycobacterial infections were due to Mycobacterium
avium complex (MAC). Other signiﬁcant infections at
presentation or during follow-up were Pneumocystis
jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), PML, and Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV)-related lymphoproliferative disease leading to B-
cell lymphoma. Most importantly, though, there was a
minority of ICL patients who were asymptomatic and
remained as such for a long period of time with no
infections or other disease. It is reasonable to hypo-
thesize, as a result, that there is a subpopulation within
ICL with a more favorable outcome that may be under-
reported in the literature. This has been suggested in the
past [24], although asymptomatic CD4 lymphocytopenia
may be extremely rare or transient [25]. Other notable
infections described are varicella zoster virus infection,
histoplasmosis, Candida, toxoplasmosis, aspergillosis,
cytomegalovirus, and Leishmania. Recently, a number of
cases of ICL-related PML have been reported, signifying
the potential gravity of the ICL diagnosis given the
ominous prognosis of this infection and the absence of
validated anti-viral therapy targeting John Cunningham
(JC) virus [26]. A special consideration is warranted for
the cases of ICL and tuberculosis since untreated
tuberculosis can lower CD4 T-cell counts and eﬀective
tuberculosis treatment usually leads to restoration of
CD4 lymphocytopenia [27].
Malignancy is also common in ICL, mainly lymphoma,
and speciﬁcally EBV-related B-cell [8], primary eﬀusion,
and central nervous system lymphoma. Other possible
malignancies include Kaposi’s sarcoma and cervical or
perineal neoplasias in the setting of long-term HPV
infections [8]. In summary, patients with ICL and HIV-
infected individuals with comparable CD4 T-cell counts
appear to have a similar pattern of susceptibility to
opportunistic pathogens (manifesting as infections or
neoplasms).
Diagnosis and differential diagnosis
Although establishing the presence of lymphocytopenia
in an HIV-uninfected patient with an opportunistic
infection is relatively straightforward, determining that
the patient has ICL is not. The diﬀerential diagnosis of
ICL is large (Table 1) [22] and this diagnosis remains one
of exclusion and requires an extensive immunologic,
hematologic, rheumatologic, and infectious disease work-
up as well as follow-up testing to conﬁrm the persistence
of lymphocytopenia. As stated in the syndrome
deﬁnition, other forms of immunodeﬁciency have to be
excluded and the provisional ICL diagnosis has to be
laboratory-conﬁrmed at least twice during a period of 1
to 3  months. A comprehensive immunologic work-up
should be applied in order to exclude HIV infection,
lymphoma, autoimmune diseases, other forms of
immunodeﬁciency (such as common variable immuno-
deﬁciency), and sarcoidosis (Table  1). As mentioned
above with tuberculosis, special attention should also be
paid to the possibility that the presenting infection or
treatment may be the cause of lymphocytopenia.
The relationship between ICL and autoimmune disease
is a complicated one. Although lymphocytopenia is a
known consequence of some autoimmune diseases such
as systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren’s syndrome
[8,28], patients with ICL appear to be at increased risk for
autoimmune diseases possibly due to a break of tolerance
(lack of self-recognition) that can occur in the setting of
lymphopenia-induced T-cell proliferation lymphopenia
[29,30]. Autoimmune diagnoses described among patients
with ICL include antiphospholipid antibody syndrome,
psoriasis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, ulcerative
colitis, Grave’s disease, vitiligo, autoimmune thyroiditis,
Behçet’s disease, and vasculitis. The diagnosis of ICL,
when autoimmune disease is present, can therefore be
challenging since lymphocytopenia might be a feature of
autoimmunity itself or ICL may be the underlying cause
of autoimmunity. Complicating the assessment further
may be the possibility of transient lymphocytopenia
related to immunosuppressive therapies.

Lymphocytopenia in the setting of Sjögren’s syndrome
needs to be addressed separately. Soon after ICL was ﬁrst
described, it was noted that patients with Sjögren’s
syndrome have an increased incidence of low CD4 T-cell
numbers which fulﬁlled ICL criteria but also correlated
with anti-SSA antibody positivity [31] and predisposed
these patients to lymphoma [28,32]. In a key study
designed to identify predictors of lymphoma in a primary
Sjögren’s syndrome population, CD4 lymphocytopenia
and a low CD4/CD8 ratio were strongly associated with
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [33].
Finally, another signiﬁcant association that may be
overlooked is between lymphocytopenia and sarcoidosis.
There have been reported cases of the concomitant
existence of the two conditions in the past [34], and there
is also an increased incidence of opportunistic infections
in sarcoidosis (cryptococcosis in particular), especially in
corticosteroid-treated patients. Recently, it has been
shown that the low CD4 T-cell count in certain patients
with sarcoidosis may relate to disease severity [35] and
may represent a distinct phenotype with a favorable
response to anti-TNF-α treatment [36]. Since it is unclear
whether sarcoidosis may coexist with ICL or lympho-
penia may be merely a manifestation of severe
sarcoidosis, the diagnosis of ICL should be questioned
when sarcoidosis is conﬁrmed. Our position is that CD4
lymphopenia in the presence of an established diagnosis
(sarcoidosis or Sjögren’s syndrome, for example) could be
viewed as an extreme phenotype of the underlying
condition and not necessarily as coexistence of ICL with
another condition.
There is no consensus for diagnostic investigation of
possible ICL cases. The diagnostic work-up focused on
excluding alternative diagnoses should be dictated by the
presenting symptoms, and special attention should be
given to signs of rheumatologic, infectious, immunologic,
or hematologic abnormality. The investigation should
typically consist of lymphocyte ﬂow cytometry, including
CD4, CD8, natural killer, and B-cell subsets as well as
immunoglobulin levels, HIV 1-2 serology and PCR,
HTLV 1 and 2 testing, EBV and cytomegalovirus PCRs,
and an autoantibody panel. The presenting opportunistic
infection or suggestive signs or symptoms should dictate
the infectious disease work-up. Appropriate imaging by
computed tomography or positron emission tomography
and bone marrow biopsy should be performed if
lymphoma is suspected. If clinical and laboratory features
of WHIM are observed, T  cells should be assessed for
CXCR4 expression. Genetic testing should be performed
when familial clustering is observed or when the clinical
features suggest any of the described genetic syndromes.
Functional T-cell assays looking at cytokine production
or proliferation in response to antigen or TCR repertoire
analysis are of interest to better understand pathogenesis
but have not been clearly linked to clinical prognosis or
diagnosis.
Treatment
The treatment of ICL is inﬂuenced by the initial clinical
presentation. Monitoring of asymptomatic ICL indi-
viduals should be regular during the immediate follow-
up period after diagnosis since most opportunistic
infections have been described in the ﬁrst months of
follow-up. Although there is no consensus about how
often these patients should be followed, a 3- to 6-month
interval may suﬃce in most cases. After the ﬁrst few
years of follow-up, less frequent evaluation could be
appropriate. Special attention should be paid in certain
populations with a possible adverse outcome. Low CD8
T-cell count (below 180/mm3
) has been associated with
opportunistic infection-related death [23]. Therefore, this
subset of ICL individuals might beneﬁt from evaluations
that are more frequent. Screening for lymphoma or HPV-
related cervical or anal dysplasia or a combination of
these may also be appropriate.
Although it is clear that opportunistic infections in
patients with ICL should be treated vigorously with
continuing secondary prophylaxis, there is insuﬃcient
evidence to guide primary infection prophylaxis. In a
median follow-up of 49.5 months in our cohort, infection
was diagnosed in 15 (41.6%) of the patients and severe
opportunistic infections were diagnosed in four (13.8%)

of these 15 [8]. Interestingly, only one episode of PCP and
two of MAC were diagnosed during a cumulative 164
patient-years of follow-up. Our natural history study
precluded any ﬁrm conclusions about who should be
oﬀered prophylaxis but does seem to demonstrate that
the risk of MAC and PCP infections is much greater in
untreated HIV-infected individuals with AIDS. Although
HIV infection and ICL diﬀer substantially in etiology,
progression, and prognosis, the literature on prophylaxis
of opportunistic diseases in HIV infection provides the
best available data with respect to opportunistic infection
prophylaxis in ICL. Thus, patients with ICL may
reasonably be oﬀered infection prophylaxis that is based
on established guidelines for patients with HIV/AIDS.
In selected patients with a history of life-threatening
infections or profound immunodeﬁciency or persistent
opportunistic infections, strategies to increase the
circulating CD4 lymphocytes could be considered. It is
possible that there is publication bias toward reports of
successful outcomes of immune-based therapies in this
setting. Therapeutic options used to increase CD4 cells
or improve immune function (or both) in ICL include the
use of IL-2, IFN-γ therapy, IL-7, and hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation. Therapy with IL-2 was ﬁrst used in
the form of subcutaneous polyethylene glycol-IL-2 for
5.5 years in a woman with chronic severe mycobacterial
disease; she had signiﬁcant clinical improvement but a
moderate and slow CD4 count increase from approxi-
mately 29/mm3
before treatment to 100/mm3
after 1 year
of therapy [37]. A man with ICL and relapsing generalized
herpes zoster infection was treated with IL-2 every other
week for 5 months and had clinical improvement and a
CD4 count increase from 24 to 93/mm3
. The patient
developed gastric anaplastic large-cell mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue lymphoma 1 year after IL-2 treatment
and subsequently died [22,38]. A 33-year-old woman
who had ICL but who also had an IgA and IgG
monoclonal gammopathy and renal disease received IL-2
and had a regression of gammopathy and a signiﬁcant
CD4 increase from 40/mm3
to constantly above 300/mm3
after treatment [39]. A 16-year-old boy with ICL and
recurrent cryptococcal meningitis was treated with re-
combinant IL-2 twice weekly and showed clinical
improvement and a CD4 count increase from 202 to 262
and 323/mm3
after 5 and 9 months of therapy, respect-
ively [40]. All of the above cases are summarized in a
report of a 39-year-old man who had a Mycobacterium
avium intracellulare infection that was treated with IL-2
for 35 months and who was apparently cured while his
CD4 count increased from 365 to 470/mm3
at the end of
therapy [41]. A 64-year-old man with recurrent dissemi-
nated Mycobacterium avium intracellulare infection was
also treated with IL-2 in three cycles of 5 consecutive
days each every other month and had a favorable clinical
outcome and CD4 number increases after each IL-2 cycle
[42]. Finally, a recent report described a series of four ICL
patients who received several courses of recombinant
IL-2 for up to 3 years [18]. Three patients responded with
either sustained or transient CD4 count increases
whereas one did not. Two ICL patients with disseminated
MAC were treated with IL-2 at the National Institutes of
Health but had no clinical improvement and both subse-
quently died (Michael Sneller, personal communication).
IFN-γ therapy has been oﬀered in selected ICL cases.
Three patients with ICL were included in a study of IFN-γ
in refractory disseminated non-tuberculous mycobacteria
infection, and two of them had clinical improvement and
CD4 count increases [43]. Two more patients with a
potential beneﬁt from IFN-γ treatment have been
documented in the literature [16,42], whereas others had
no clear beneﬁt [37,38].
It has been shown that, in patients with idiopathic CD4
lymphopenia, an impaired IL-7 response to CD4 deple-
tion may contribute to the impaired lymphocyte
homeostasis [11]. As such, an increased availability of
IL-7 could play a critical role in restoring T-cell homeo-
stasis by enhancing eﬀective proliferation and by
improving T-cell survival. IL-7 has been reported to lead
to increases in both CD4 and CD8 T  cells in other
lymphopenic settings at well-tolerated doses [44-46].
IL-7 immunotherapy is currently being investigated in an
open-label, single-arm, phase I/IIa clinical trial of glyco-
sylated recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) in ICL patients
at risk of disease progression [47]. Successful control of
PML has been reported in a patient with ICL by using a
combination of CMX001 (investigational oral drug for
double-stranded DNA viral diseases, including JC) and
IL-7 that led to stabilization of neurologic symptoms and
CD4 increases [48].
Finally, it is worth mentioning two key studies of a
complete restoration of CD4 counts to normal levels and
apparent cure of ICL in individuals treated with non-
myeloablative allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
for aplastic anemia or ICL or both [49,50]. Although
these results are promising, this therapeutic option
clearly should be reserved for a carefully selected popu-
lation with severe disease in an appropriate clinical
setting.
Prognosis
The prognosis of ICL is critically inﬂuenced by the
opportunistic infections that may complicate the natural
history of the syndrome. Low CD8 numbers (<180/mm3
)
and the degree of CD4 T-cell activation as measured by
HLA-DR expression have been associated with an adverse
outcome [8], namely opportunistic infection-related
death. Lymphocytopenia is typically not progressive, and
in some instances CD4 numbers can return to normal

levels in the follow-up period for reasons that are unclear.
Finally, as chronic HPV infections may predispose
patients to squamous cell carcinomas, appropriate cancer
screening should be entertained.
Conclusions
Despite 20  years of investigation, ICL remains a syn-
drome of uncertain pathogenesis, prognosis, and treat-
ment and can be a devastating diagnosis for some
patients. Although a subset of patients with ICL may
remain asymptomatic, others may go on to develop life-
threatening opportunistic infections or autoimmune
conditions or severe HPV-related dysplasia and malig-
nancy. The cause or causes of ICL remain unknown,
although several distinct genetic mutations have been
reported recently and appear to be responsible in some
patients. Further study of the genetic basis and immuno-
pathogenesis of this heterogenous condition is required
so that targeted treatments for ICL patients at increased
risk of signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality can be safely
established.
