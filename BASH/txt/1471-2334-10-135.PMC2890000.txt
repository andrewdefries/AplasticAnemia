Abstract
Background: Bloodstream Infections (BSIs) in neutropenic patients often cause considerable morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the surveillance and early identification of patients at high risk for developing BSIs might be useful for the
development of preventive measures. The aim of the current study was to assess the predictive power of three scoring
systems: Infection Probability Score (IPS), APACHE II and KARNOFSKY score for the onset of Bloodstream Infections in
hematology-oncology patients.
Methods: A total of 102 patients who were hospitalized for more than 48 hours in a hematology-oncology
department in Athens, Greece between April 1st and October 31st 2007 were included in the study. Data were collected
by using an anonymous standardized recording form. Source materials included medical records, temperature charts,
information from nursing and medical staff, and results on microbiological testing. Patients were followed daily until
hospital discharge or death.
Results: Among the 102 patients, Bloodstream Infections occurred in 17 (16.6%) patients. The incidence density of
Bloodstream Infections was 7.74 per 1,000 patient-days or 21.99 per 1,000 patient-days at risk. The patients who
developed a Bloodstream Infection were mainly females (p = 0.004), with twofold time mean length of hospital stay (p
< 0.001), with fourfold time mean length of neutropenia (p < 0.001), with neutropenia < 500 (p < 0.001), suffered
mainly from acute myeloid leukemia (p < 0.001), had been exposed to antibiotics (p = 0.045) and chemotherapy (p =
0.023), had a surgery (p = 0.048) and a Hickman catheter (p = 0.025) as compared to the patients without Bloodstream
Infection. The best cut-off value of IPS for the prediction of a Bloodstream Infection was 10 with a sensitivity of 75% and
specificity of 70.9%
Conclusion: Between the three different prognostic scoring systems, Infection Probability Score had the best
sensitivity in predicting Bloodstream Infections.
Background
Bloodstream infections are an important cause of mor-
bidity and mortality in immunocompromised popula-
tions [1]. Patients with hematologic malignancies such as
acute leukemia, malignant lymphoma, and multiple
myeloma are at increased risk for healthcare-associated
bloodstream infections because of the intensive cytotoxic
chemotherapy, which often renders them pancytopenic
for long periods of time [2]. Several clinical trials showed
improved survival with the use of immediate empirical
broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy at onset of fever,
which has become the standard procedure [3,4]. Despite
such an immediate approach, Bloodstream Infections
(BSIs) in neutropenic patients often cause considerable
morbidity and mortality. The high mortality is partly
related to BSIs caused by microorganisms resistant to
broad-spectrum antibiotics [5].

Laboratory-based strategies for the surveillance of
bloodstream infections in the hematology department
should be reported periodically, and used for longitudinal
assessment [6]. Such data can then inform decisions
about screening, prophylaxis and empirical therapy. If
clinical data are also collected for surveillance purposes
(e.g presence of CVC, risk factors for the development of
bacteraemia), an understanding of the required resources
and prevention strategies should also be available [7]. In
patients with suspected bloodstream infections and new
skin lesions, urgent biopsy of necrotizing hematologic
lesions should be performed to aid in the diagnosis of dis-
seminated mould infection. Non-culture based diagnosis
techniques have been used for the early detection of fun-
gaemia in hematology patients but are not recommended
for routine use in the clinical practice [8]. In addition, the
benefit of prophylaxis for the reduction of disease inci-
dence must be weighed against the potential for the selec-
tion of resistant isolates [9]. Implementation of infection
control practices is required, particularly for the control
of transmission of multi-resistant organisms [10]. Sur-
veillance may be justified in case of hospital outbreaks or
periods of increasing endemicity, to facilitate the isola-
tion and barrier precautions for the patients who are col-
onized or infected with multi-resistant organisms. For
clusters or outbreaks of hospital infections, appropriate
investigation, including environmental sampling, clinical
screening and risk factor analysis may be required [11].
In Greece, the data concerning BSIs occurring in hae-
matology/oncology units are sparse. Therefore, the sur-
veillance and early identification of patients at high risk
for developing BSIs might be useful for the development
of preventive measures. The objective of this study was to
assess the predictive power of three systems: Infection
Probability Score (IPS), APACHE II and Karnofsky score
for the onset of BSIs in hematology/oncology patients,
which will provide a basis to design more effective guide-
lines for the prevention and treatment of these infections.
Methods
A retrospective review of all records during a seven-
month period (1/4/2007-30/10/2007) was conducted in
the hematology-oncology unit of a general hospital in
Athens, Greece. All patients who were hospitalized for
more than 48 hours in the hematology-oncology unit
were included in the analysis. The surveillance of nosoco-
mial BSI was performed by the physician in charge of the
patient and a specifically trained nurse. It included a daily
clinical examination of the patients and daily reviewing of
the patient's medical records, Kardex data, temperature
charts, information from the nursing and the medical
staff, and all the microbiological data of a positive blood
result.
Data were collected by using an anonymous standard-
ized case-record form. Patient data consisted of I) demo-
graphic characteristics: age, length of stay, outcome
(survivors or non-survivors), II) risk factors: underlying
malignancy, underlying diseases: Infection on admission,
diabetes mellitus, short or long term presence of an
indwelling central venous catheter (CVC), total paren-
teral nutrition, duration of neutropenia, exposure to che-
motherapy, antibiotics or corticosteroid therapy and
prior surgical procedure.
The diagnosis and the source of blood-stream infection
were determined by the physician in charge and a specifi-
cally trained nurse, and were based on objective clinical
evidence, microbiological data, clinical judgment and the
definitions proposed by CDC. Blood cultures were per-
formed in aerobic and anaerobic bottles and incubated in
an automatic system. Bacteria were identified using stan-
dard microbiological methods. Antimicrobial therapy
was given and adapted according to the susceptibility
testing by the physician in charge of the patient. Patients
were followed daily for BSI from admission until dis-
charge or death. Patients were diagnosed with BSI on the
date of the first positive result. The diagnosis of BSIs was
based on definitions proposed by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention [12].
Ethical considerations
The research protocol was approved by the Ethics Com-
mittee of the Hospital in which the survey has been con-
ducted. The anonymity and the confidentiality of the
patients' data have been assured by the research team.
Case definitions
Neutropenia was defined as an absolute blood neutrophil
count less than 500/ml. Laboratory-confirmed blood-
stream infection-LCBI: LCBI must meet at least one of
the following criteria:
1. Patient has a recognized pathogen cultured from 1 or
more blood cultures and organism cultured from blood is
not related to an infection at another site.
2. Patient has at least one of the following signs or
symptoms: fever (≥38°C) chills, or hypotension and signs
and symptoms and positive laboratory results are not
related to an infection at another site and common skin
contaminant (ie, diphtheroids (Corynebacterium spp)
Bacillus (not B anthracis) spp, Propionibacterium spp,
coagulase-negative staphylococci (including S epider-
midis) viridans group streptococci, Aerococcus spp,
Micrococcus spp) is cultured from 2 or more blood cul-
tures drawn on separate occasions.
The incidence rate was defined as the number of new
cases of BSIs divided by the total number of patient-days
and patient-days at risk (neutropenic days) in the popula-
tion studied.

Instruments
The IPS is a simple scoring system that assesses the prob-
ability of infection in critically ill patients. It has been
developed and validated in ICU [13]. IPS uses six simple
and commonly used variables and ranges from 0-26
points (0-2 for temperature, 0-12 for heart rate, 0-1 for
respiratory rate, 0-3 for white blood cell count, 0-6 for C-
reactive protein, 0-2 for sequential organ failure assess-
ment score [14].
APACHE II is a severity of disease classification system
that uses a point score based on initial values of 12 rou-
tine physiologic measurements, age and previous health
status, to provide a general measure of severity of disease.
The total score in the APACHE II is 71, which includes
the sum of physiological score, age score and chronic
health evaluation [15].
The KARNOFSKY Performance Scale Index allows
patients to be classified as to their functional impairment.
The lower the KARNOFSKY score, the worse the survival
for most serious illnesses [16]. The KARNOFSKY score
runs from 100 to 0, where 100 is "perfect" health and 0 is
death. Although the score has been described with inter-
vals of 10, a practitioner may choose decimals if he or she
feels a patient's situation holds somewhere between two
marks [17]. Table 1 displays the score calculation of the
three scales.
Data analysis
All of the items were coded and scored and the com-
pleted forms were included in the data analysis set. SPSS-
17 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, US) was used to analyze the data.
Continuous variables were compared using Student's t-
test. The x2 statistic or Fisher's Exact Test were used to
compare categorical variables. All values are expressed as
the mean ± SD or median for continuous variables and as
a percentage of the group they were derived from cate-
gorical variables. ROC curve calculations have been per-
formed by using MedCalc statistical software. Receiver
operating characteristics (ROC) curves compared sensi-
tivity and specificity of the three scoring systems
(APACHE II, KARNOFSKY and IPS scores) over a wide
range of cut-off values for predicting the onset of BSI.
The area under the ROC is a convenient way of compar-
ing classifiers. A random classifier has an area of 0.5,
while an ideal one has an area of 1. The ROC curve was
used to choose the best operating point. All p values of <
0.05 were considered statistically significant unless other-
wise stated.
Results
Over the seven-month period a total of 102 patients with
2,197 patient-days were admitted in a hematology/oncol-
ogy unit in Athens-Greece and were prospectively evalu-
ated. Among the participants, 53 (52%) were males and
49 (48%) were females. The baseline clinical characteris-
tics of the patients are illustrated in Table 1. Patients had
a mean age of 53.30 ± 18.59 years (median 56 years, range
17 - 85 years). The mean duration of neutropenia was sig-
nificantly longer for patients with BSI than for patients
without BSI (21.06 ± 8.33 vs 5.07 ± 8.32 days, p < 0.001).
The majority of the patients (33.3%) suffered from acute
myeloid leukemia (Tables 1 and 2).
As it is displayed in Table 2, the mean APACHE II score
did not differ statistically (p = 0.876) between those with
a BSI and those without BSI. On the contrary IPS score
was significantly (p = 0.010) higher in the patients with a
BSI (11.06 ± 5.10) as opposed to those without BSI (6.59 ±
6.41).
The patients who developed a BSI were mainly females
(p = 0.004), with twofold higher time for mean length of
hospital stay (p < 0.001), with fourfold higher time for
mean length of neutropenia (p < 0.001), with neutropenia
< 500 (p < 0.001), suffered mainly from acute myeloid leu-
kemia (p < 0.001), had been exposed to antibiotics (p =
0.045) and chemotherapy (p = 0.023), had a surgery (p =
0.048) and a Hickman catheter (p = 0.025) as compared to
patients without BSI (Table 2).
The cumulative incidence of BSI was 16.7% and the
incidence rate of BSI was 7.74 per 1,000 patient-days or
21.99 per 1,000 patient-days at risk. The most common
isolates were gram-negative (44.4%) and gram positive
(44.4%) microorganisms.
Determination of the best cut-off point for the prediction
of BSI onset
Table 3 illustrates the predictive values of the three scor-
ing systems calculated at the best cut-off point according
to the ROC curve. As can be seen, the IPS score system
better predicts the onset of a BSI compared to the two
other scoring systems. Discrimination power of IPS AUC
was acceptable as opposed to APACHE II AUC and KAR-
NOFSKY AUC that were poor. The best cut-off value of
IPS for the prediction of a BSI was 10 with a sensitivity of
75% and a specificity of 70.9% (Table 3).
Logistic regression analysis revealed that IPS was the
only significant predictor of BSI onset (OR = 5.60; 95% CI
= 1.66-18.88; p = 0.003) compared with APACHE II (OR
= 0.71; 95% CI = 0.22-2.28; p = 0.546) and KARNOFSKY
(OR = 0.39; 95% CI = 1.13-1.18; p = 0.121).
Discussion and Conclusion
A retrospective study was conducted in order to examine
the predictive power of three different scoring systems
for BSI in a hematological unit. The literature regarding
predictive power of IPS in hematology/oncology patients
is sparse. Most of the information about the epidemiol-
ogy of BSIs and outcome is extrapolated from studies of
hospitalized patients in general hospitals or from studies

of patients in University hospitals [18] or, more specifi-
cally, from studies of neutropenic cancer patients [19]. In
our study, the incidence density of BSIs (21.99 per 1,000
patient-days at risk) was higher than that reported by pre-
vious studies (11.2 per 1000 patient-days at risk) [20].
Furthermore in the current study the crude mortality
(5.9%) was lower than that reported elsewhere [21]. One
of the major problems associated with comparison stud-
ies, is the difficulty in interpretation caused by variability
in study designs and efficacy or outcome measures [22].
Furthermore, many patients with neutropenia have com-
plex medical profiles, leading to increased physician con-
cern and a tendency to modify regimens during the
treatment course of febrile episodes. Such modifications
generally are made in a setting of inadequate information
or lack of definitive diagnosis. It has been estimated that
empiric regimens may be modified in 40% to 60% of cases
[23].
Furthermore, we found that the most common isolates
were gram-negative (44.4%) and gram positive (44.4%)
microorganisms. Our findings are very similar to those
reported in other studies [24]. It is noteworthy that a con-
siderable shift in the spectrum of pathogens isolated from
blood cultures of febrile neutropenic cancer patients in
the USA has emerged since 1995, with Gram-positive
cocci increasing from 62% to 76% of isolates [21], Gram-
negative bacilli declining from 21.5% to 14% and fungi
declining from 15 to 8%. Based on consecutive clinical
trials conducted by the European Organization on the
Research and treatment of cancer (EORTC) between
1973 and 2000, a shift toward the predominance of Cram-
positive bacteria has also been reported however, during
the most recent time period (1998 - 2000), Gram- posi-
tive and Gram-negative isolates have been involved in the
same magnitude [24].
A number of epidemiological factors may have contrib-
uted to this changing pattern. Firstly, this period corre-
sponds to the uptake of widespread empiric antibiotic
therapy for febrile neutropenia especially fluroquinolones
and third/fourth generation cephalosporines), with
resulting selection pressure for gram-positive bacteria
[25]. Secondly, the use of more intensive treatments with
more severe oral mucositis may provide a frequent portal
of entry for gram-positive organisms. Thirdly, increased
utility of medium to long-term venous access devises for
patients with malignancy may increase gram-positive
blood stream infections (particularly staphylococcal
infections [26]. Finally, local infection control practices
may impact upon the number of infections and spectrum
of causative organisms. Further investigation of the data
of patients with BSIs showed that most patients had
received third/fourth generation cephalosporines (53%)
and quinolones (35.3%), and they had central venous
(11%) and Hickman catheters. Our findings highlight that
the ongoing co-operation between haematologists,
oncologists and infectious disease specialists is important
to detect trends in epidemiology, which can be used to
design empirical antibiotic regimens and guide infection
control policies [27].
The mean IPS score was higher in patients with a BSI.
This is a common finding in the two other researches
supporting the discriminative adequacy of the tool
[13,28]. The two previous studies have confirmed the pre-
dictive power of the IPS for the onset of a Healthcare
Associated Infection (HCAI). The current study extends
the use of IPS as a predictor of the onset of a BSI. Addi-
tionally, the IPS separated infected from non-infected
patients already on the first day of evaluation [28]. This
finding enables the therapeutic team to early detect the
infected patients, as well as to avoid the administration of
unnecessary antibiotics to the patients that are unlikely
considered to be infected. Further studies with a bigger
sample would be useful to give more evidence to this
argument.
Between the three different prognostic scoring systems,
IPS had the best sensitivity in predicting BSI. It is worth
noting that IPS as a risk factor for BSIs in cancer patients
has never being studied before. A previous study has used
IPS to predict the need for mechanical ventilation and the
duration of mechanical ventilation [29] and for the pre-
diction of HCAI in the ICU patients [28]. In a previous
study [28] the cutoff point for the prediction of a HAI was
14 with a positive predictive value of 53.6% and a negative
predictive value of 89.5%. In our study the cutoff point for
the prediction of a BSI was 10 with a positive predictive
value of 37% and a negative predictive value of 92.5%. The
patients were considered as unlikely to be infected with a
BSI if they had a score < 10 points. An IPS score >10 rep-
resents an argument against a BSI onset in oncology-
hematology patients and should be considered as a com-
plementary tool for the early detection of a BSI. In the
present study the best cut-off value of IPS for the predic-
tion of a BSI was 10 as opposed to 14 that has been previ-
ously reported from Martini et al. [28] and Peres-Bota
[13]. One possible explanation is that the present
research has been conducted in a sample of hematology/
oncology patients who had a different nosological profile
compared to the ICU patients. Furthermore Martini et al.
[28] have used a priori the cut-off value 14 without testing
its sensitivity and specificity as opposed to our study that
has used ROC analysis to find the best cut-off value. A
further research is needed to compare IPS scores
between several categories of patients. A multi-centered
study would be useful to test the reliability of the tool in
patients with a similar pathology.
The AUC value of IPS is associated with a good test as
it is above 0.70 with means that the probability that the
patients will be correctly classified as an infected person

is 72%. It may be considered that a bigger sample of
bloodstream infected person would help us to make safer
conclusions. Furthermore it could be argued that the tool
is more sensitive in predicting the onset of a HAI com-
pared with the onset of a BSI. In conclusion the calcula-
tion of the IPS score is simple and the variables used can
be obtained routinely, without additional costs. Addition-
ally it is easy to be used from the clinicians.
To reduce the risk of BSIs and associated mortality in
the hematology population, a number of strategies may
be implemented including the routine use of IPS. Early
identification of a changing spectrum and antimicrobial
sensitivity of isolates should always be monitored. Fre-
quently, a multi-disciplinary approach is recommended,
to facilitate certain interventions such as typing of iso-
lates, ward cleaning and structural modification of clini-
cal areas. Guidelines for empirical antibiotic therapy for
febrile neutropenia must be based upon the risk of infec-
tion in specific hematology patients and the local epide-
miology and susceptibility of infecting isolates.
