Measurements of Cyclosporine (CsA) systemic exposure permit its dose adjustment in allogenic stem cell transplantation recipients
to prevent graft-versus-host disease. CsA LSSs were developed and validated from 60 ASCT patients via multiple linear regressions.
All whole-blood samples were analyzed by ﬂuorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA-Axym). The 10 models that have used
CsA concentrations at a single time point did not have a good ﬁt with AUC0−−12 (R2
< 0.90). C2 and C4 were the time points
that correlated best with AUC0−−12h, R2
were respectively 0.848, and 0.897. The LSS equation with the best predictive performance
(bias, precision and number of samples) utilized three sampling concentrations was AUC0−−12h = 0.607 + 1.569 × C0.5 + 2.098 ×
C2 + 3.603 × C4(R2
= 0.943). Optimal LSSs equations which limited to those utilizing three timed concentrations taken within 4
hours post-dose developed from ASCT recipient’s patients yielded a low bias <5% ranged from 1.27% to 2.68% and good precision
<15% ranged from 9.60% and 11.02%. We propose an LSS model with equation AUC0−−12h = 0.82 + 2.766 × C2 + 3.409 × C4 for
a practical reason. Bias and precision for this model are respectively 2.68% and 11.02%.
1. Introduction
Cyclosporine is one of the most common immunosuppre-
ssants used in allogenic stem cells transplant (ASCT) both in
children and adults [1, 2]. This population had more diges-
tive problems compared to solid transplant patient; con-
sisting of mucositis and diﬀuse inﬂammation of the intesti-
nal tract related to the preparative regimen. In addition,
they frequently develop digestive graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD) and intestinal viral disease aﬀecting the absorption
of CsA [3–5]. In most case cyclosporine is administered in-
travenously from day −1 to days 30–50 then orally until day
180 [6].
Individualization of cyclosporine (CsA) dosage using
therapeutic drug monitoring remains an indispensable tool
for management of CsA therapy [7, 8]. A number of clinical
trials have employed C2 monitoring in solid organ transplan-
tations and demonstrated improvements in rejection rates
and acute toxicity compared to trough-level (C0) monitoring
[9, 10].
In ASCT Barkholt et al. [11] have not found a correlation
between C2 and either severs GVHD or infection in ASCT
patients with C0 guided CsA dosing. Furukawa et al., 2010
[12], demonstrate that in ASCT patients receiving twice-
daily 3 h intravenous administrations, the concentration of
CsA at 2 h (C2) and 2 h and 50 min (C3) were best single
predictors of exposure (AUC0–12h) while the trough concen-
tration correlates poorly. Inoue et al. [13] were observed two
close relationships between AUC0–12h and the C3 for infusion
and between AUC0–12h and the C8 for oral administration.
The area under a blood drug concentration-time curve
(AUC) is an important index in therapeutic drug monitoring

and in pharmacokinetics. Unfortunately, obtaining complete
pharmacokinetic proﬁles from transplant patients is not
always an easy task due to ethical, practical, and economical
reasons. Therefore, reducing the number of blood samples
necessary for determinations would be very practical for
patient management and would help in cyclosporine moni-
toring. Recently, limited sampling strategies (LSSs) have been
developed to predict the AUC0–12h; several of them are used
to predict cyclosporine AUC in transplanted patients. Up to
now, more than 100 equations to estimate AUC using limited
sampling strategy have been published, but most of them
have not been validated [14].
ASCT outcomes may be optimized by cyclosporine dose
adjustment according to systemic exposure (measured by
AUC) rather than trough concentration.
The aim of this study was to develop LSSs for predicting
cyclosporine AUC0–12h to provide a practical method for a
more accurate therapeutic (TDM) after oral dosing in pa-
tients undergoing ASCT and validated selected models.
2. Patients and Methods
2.1. Patients. Following ethics approval by the institutional
review board, 60 ASCT recipient’s patients enrolled the study
(new graft in 2009). The patient’s characteristics are listed
in Table 1. Diseases consisted in acute myeloblastic leukemia
(n = 32 patients) acquired aplastic anemia (n = 12 patients),
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 8), Fanconi’s anemia
(n = 4 patients), multiple myeloma (n = 1 patient), and
Gaucher disease (n = 1 patient).
Conditioning regimens consisted on IV Busulfan + Cyclo-
phosphamide (36 patients), Fractionated Total body Irradia-
tion + Etoposide (8 patients), horse antithymocyte globulin
+ Cyclophosphamide (12 patients), Fludarabine + Cyclo-
phosphamide (4 patients). All patients received oral antimi-
crobial prophylaxis with amoxicillin or spiramycin, ﬂucona-
zole, and acyclovir.
CsA (Sandimmun) was started by continuous intraven-
ous (i.v.) infusion from day 1 to 15–21 days after transplanta-
tion, and then patients were randomized to oral CsA (equoral
or neoral) at twice IV dose. After that all patients received
oral CsA (mean of 300 mg/day). The daily dose was taken in
two equally divided doses at 12 h intervals.

2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria . After the conditioning
regimes, patients were included in the study, if they were aged
between 3 and 50 years, clinically stable after a ﬁrst ASCT,
and receiving oral CsA as graft-versus-host disease pro-
phylaxis. Patients should have stable serum creatinine (<2
baseline value) and no history of hepatic dysfunction (bili-
rubin and aminotransferases <2 normal value).
Patients excluded if they developed graft-versus-host dis-
ease or microangiopathy, received another drug which inter-
feres with CsA pharmacokinetics, and showed evidence of
noncontrol digestive problem, renal (2 × creatinine baseline
value), or hepatic dysfunction (bilirubin and aminotrans-
ferases >2 × normal value).
2.3. Blood Sampling and Measurements of Cyclosporine Con-
centrations. After written informed consent, blood samples
(3 mL) were collected in tubes containing EDTA anticoag-
ulant from the patients at time 0 (C0; pre dose) and at
0.5 h (C0.5), 1 h (C1), 1.5 h (C1.5), 2 h (C2), 3 h (C3), 4 h
(C4), 6 h (C6), 8 h (C8), and 12 h (C12) after steady-state
morning Cs dose. All whole-blood samples were analyzed
by ﬂuorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA-Axym) in
Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology of the National Center
of Pharmacovigilance. Precision data of immunoassay was
demonstrated previously by comparison of the two methods
for CsA therapeutic monitoring HPLC and AxSYM. Result
showed that the correlation coeﬃcient is 0.99 [15].
2.4. Pharmacokinetic and Statistical Analysis
2.4.1. Pharmacokinetics. Peak CsA concentration (Cmax) and
the time to reach it (Tmax) were recorded for each patient and
were reported as the mean ± standard deviation.
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a non-
compartment model. The area under the plasma concen-
tration-time curves AUC0–12h was calculated from drug
plasma concentration data based on trapezoid rule [16].
2.4.2. Limited Sampling Strategy (LSS). CsA LSSs were de-
veloped and validated from 60 ASCT patients (30 in
the development group and 30 in the validation group)
via multiple linear regressions.

after dosing (R2 = 0.897), (d) model using concentrations at 2 and 4 hours after dosing (R2 = 0.930), (e) model using concentrations at 0.5,
2 and 4 hours after dosing (R2 = 0.943), and (f) model using concentrations at 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after dosing (R2 = 0.965).
Step 1. Multiple linear regressions were performed to esti-
mate abbreviated AUC (dependent variable) and each time
point of CsA levels (independent variables) that best ﬁtted
the CsA AUC0–12h. Selected models are those who have P <
0.05 for any sampling time and high correlation coeﬃcient
(R2 > 0.9). These analyses produced equations AUC as
follows: AUC = Cst + M1 × C1 + M2 × C2 + · · · + Mn × Cn;
M and Cst are coeﬃcients and n is the number of samples.
Optimal LSS equations were limited to those utilizing a
maximum of four timed concentrations taken within 6 hours
after dose, and with a coeﬃcient of determination (R2) > 0.9.
Step 2. To validate the equation, we used a second group of
pharmacokinetic proﬁle data obtained from ASCT patients
recipients (validation group) with the same characteristics as
the initial group. Predictive performances of LSS equations
were evaluated by calculating the percentage bias (mean pre-
diction error me %) and percentage precision (root-mean-
squared prediction error rmse %) [17, 18].

3. Results
Thirty full pharmacokinetic proﬁles of CsA were obtained
(Figure 1). The mean CsA dose at the time of the measure-
ment was 113 ± 40.85 mg. The peak concentration of CsA
generally accrued 2-3 hours after morning dosing. Mean
trough concentration C0 was 0.470 ± 0.178µg·mL−1. The
mean AUC0–12h was 4.340 ± 1.195µg·h·mL−1 (Table 2).
The linear regression equations and the concentration at
each time point are listed in Table 3. The 10 models that used
CsA concentrations at a single time point did not have a good
ﬁt (R2 < 0.90). C2 and C4 were the time points that correlated
best with AUC0–12h, R2 were, respectively, 0.848 and 0.897.
Moreover, the correlation between AUC0–12h and the trough
concentration (C0 or C12) was poor, R2 = 0.391 for C0
and R2 = 0.786 for C12 (Table 3). The correlations between
AUC0–12h and CsA concentrations at various points C0, C2,
and C4, are demonstrated in Figures 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c). The
dose of CsA per kilogram of body weight and total dose of
CsA did not correlate with AUC0–12h (data not shown).
Pharmacokinetic data from 30 ASCT recipient’s patients
were used to test the LSS equations. Multiple linear regres-
sion analysis of the correlation between the estimated cyclo-
sporine (CsA) AUC0–12h and full hours CsA AUC were listed
in Table 4.
From the various equations obtained for the estimation
of CsA AUC, the equation delineated from all of the concen-
tration-time data (AUC0–12h = 0.152 − 2.249 × C0 + 0.577 ×
C0.5 + 0.871 × C1 − 0.001 × C1.5 + 0.963 × C2 + 1.16 × C3 +
0.152 × C4 + 1.66 × C6 + 3.47 × C8 + 2.703 × C12; R2 = 0.991)
had the highest coeﬃcient of determination (Figure 3(a)).
Among models that used CsA concentrations at 2 time
points, best model 1 (R2 = 0.930), which used C2 and C4.
Among models that used CsA concentrations at 3 time
points, best model 12 (R2 = 0.943), which used C0.5, C2, and
C4. Among models that used CsA concentrations at 4 time

Predictive performance of all LSSs models were summa-
rized in Table 5. All three optimal LSSs equations developed
from ASCT recipient’s patients in our laboratory yielded a
low bias <5% ranged from 1.27% to 2.68% and good pre-
cision <15% ranged from 9.60% and 11.02%. The LSS equa-
tion with the best predictive performance (bias, precision,
and number of samples) was (4), which utilizes C0.5, C2, and
C4 (Figure 2(e)). The LSS equation (2) utilizes C2 and C4
demonstrated low bias (2.68%) and good precision (11.02%;
Figure 2(d)).
4. Discussion
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major limiting
factor for a successful result after ASCT; it aﬀects mortality,
morbidity, and quality of life. CsA-based immunosuppres-
sion has been the most frequently used regimen for prophy-
laxis and treatment of GVHD in patients undergoing HSCT
[19, 20]. Therapeutic monitoring of CsA provides a more
accurate measure of posttransplant immunosuppression and
this by assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters. The area
under concentration-time curve (AUC) is a more important
index in therapeutic drug monitoring and in pharmacoki-
netics. In this investigation patients were received a mean
dose of cyclosporine A (neoral or equoral) 113.0 ± 40.85 mg.
A recent study demonstrates that two formulations were
bioequivalent in ASCT patients [21].

The time to reach Cmax(Tmax) in this study was 1.908 ±
0.954; this is similar to the values reported for other HSCT
patients, 1.9 ± 0.8 h [22] 2.4 ± 1.1 h [3]. As previous studies
have reported, Tmax for HSCT recipients has shown that
absorption is delayed in comparison to that measured in
solid organ allograft recipients [22]. It is thought that the
diﬀerences are due to the presence of gastrointestinal inﬂam-
mation caused by mucositis or GVHD [3].
A number of trials have employed C2 monitoring in
solid organ transplantation [23], C2 monitoring is being in-
creasingly employed in the management of solid organ reci-
pients with a recent survey of renal transplant centres ﬁnd-
ing that most of the respondents were now measuring C2
concentration [24]. In a stem cells transplant setting, where it
is clear that current practice of trough-level monitoring still
results in unacceptably high levels of GVHD, therefore is a
scope to explore the potential of monitoring the drug (both
I.V and oral) via alternative measures of exposure or activity
[1]. A recent investigation demonstrate a close relationship
between AUC0–12h and the C8 after oral administration of
CsA in allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(ASTH) [13], and between AUC0–12h and two concentrations
C3 and C2 after twice-daily infusion [12, 13].
Therapeutic monitoring of Tunisian ASTH patients was
based on C0 determination; this concentration is weakly
correlated with AUC0–12h (R2 = 0.391). That we bring to
search what concentrations are well correlated with AUC and
how to estimate abbreviated AUC in ASCT.
The major ﬁndings of this study are that the concentra-
tion measurements at C2 and C4 were the time points that
correlated best with AUC0–12h after oral administration of
CsA in allogenic stem cells transplant patients rather than
the trough level. These time points provide a more accurate
measure of posttransplant immunosuppression. Therefore,
the target concentration of CsA in ASHT patients, after the
switch to oral administration using C2 monitoring to adjust
the dose, is easily applied the same level of C4 monitoring
with oral administration.
Another clinically attractive ﬁnding of our study was
using two time sampling points C2 and C4 for estimating
CsA AUC0–12h. The regression equation was AUC0–12h =
0.82 + 2.766 × C2 + 3.409 × C4, R2 = 0.930). The bias
of this model was 2.68%, and the precision was 11.02%.
Additional C4 sampling is valuable to support the individual
dosing. To further increase the accuracy and decrease bias of
predicted AUC0–12h, we added time point sampling in absor-
ption phase C0.5 (R2 = 0.943, me% = 1.27, rmse% = 9.60)
or C1 (R2 = 0.939, me% = 1.35, rmse% = 9.76). Indeed,
optimal LSSs equations, which are limited to those utilizing
three timed concentrations taken within 4 hours after dose,
are (4) and (3). Optimal Among models that used CsA con-
centrations at 4 time points are model 17 (AUC0–12h =
0.148 + 2.457 × C2 + 1.582 × C4 + 1.296 × C6 + 5.81 ×
C8, R2 = 0.965). However, the negative bias obtained for
this combination (−0.21%) indicates that it tends to under-
predict AUC.
5. Conclusion
Limited sampling strategy models were selected to predict
the full 12-hour CsA AUC in allogenic haematopoietic stem
cell transplant patients receiving CsA. We propose an LSS
model with equation AUC0–12h = 0.82+2.766×C2 +3.409×
C4, which is limited to utilizing two timed concentrations
taken within 4 hours after dose and providing a low bias and
a good precision, it is for a practical reason.
