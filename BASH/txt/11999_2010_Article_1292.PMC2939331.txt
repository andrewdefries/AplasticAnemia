Abstract
Background Although numerous studies describe the
clinical characteristics of idiopathic osteonecrosis of the
femoral head (ONFH) in speciﬁc study populations, these
have not been conﬁrmed in countrywide studies.
Questions/purposes We therefore determined: (1) the
annual number of patients seeking medical care and num-
ber of patients newly diagnosed; and (2) the distribution of
the age and gender of the patients, potential causative
factors, severity of the disease, and operative procedures
performed.
Patients and Methods We conducted a nationwide epi-
demiologic survey in 2005. The survey included all
orthopaedic departments in Japan by stratiﬁed random
sampling according to the number of beds.
Results The number of patients who sought medical care
for idiopathic ONFH during 2004 was estimated to be
11,400 (95% conﬁdence interval, 10,100–12,800). We
obtained clinical information from 1502 of these patients.
The peak in age distribution occurred in the 40s. Potential
causative factors were systemic steroid administration
(51%) and habitual alcohol use (31%). Hip replacement
was the most frequently performed procedure (65%).
Among patients with a history of systemic steroid admin-
istration, systemic lupus erythematosus was reported most
frequently (31%) as the underlying disease. Among
patients younger than 40 years, steroid use was the most
prominent potential causative factor (60%), and hip
replacement frequently was performed (45%). A greater

Introduction
ONFH is not a speciﬁc disease entity, but rather the ﬁnal
common pathway of a series of conditions leading to
impairment of the blood supply to the bone [12, 15].
Numerous studies have revealed the clinical characteristics
of idiopathic ONFH in speciﬁc study populations, including
for pregnant women and patients with rheumatoid arthritis,
cancer, or multifocal osteonecrosis [4, 5, 11, 16, 21, 24].
Although these ﬁndings document potential causative fac-
tors, they have not been conﬁrmed on a countrywide basis.
Knowing the frequency of causative factors might be useful
for developing preventive measures. Information regarding
age distribution would help to establish appropriate treat-
ment strategies for different age groups.
In Japan, the Ministry of Health and Welfare (later, the
Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare) established special
measures against so-called ‘‘intractable diseases’’ in 1972.
These are deﬁned as a rare disease whose cause has yet to
be determined, and for which there still is no established
therapy. The program includes promoting research activi-
ties, eliminating patients’ copayments for medical
expenditures, and developing the necessary medical facil-
ities. Under this program, the Research Committee on
Idiopathic Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head was
established in 1975 (after 1982, the Research Committee
on Idiopathic Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head), and
nationwide surveys regarding descriptive epidemiology of
idiopathic ONFH were conducted four times previously [1,
8, 14, 18, 19]. However, we believed these ﬁndings needed
to be updated to reﬂect the most recent epidemiology of the
disease and to conﬁrm previous ﬁndings. Thus, a ﬁfth
nationwide survey was conducted to clarify the descriptive
epidemiology of idiopathic ONFH during 2004; the study
was performed cooperatively by the Research Committee
on Idiopathic Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head and the
Research Committee on Epidemiology of Intractable
Diseases.
We sought to determine: (1) the annual number of
patients seeking medical care and number of patients newly
diagnosed; and (2) the distribution of the age and gender of
the patients, potential causative factors, severity of the
disease, and operative procedures performed.
Patients and Methods
The survey consisted of two queries; the ﬁrst query esti-
mated the number of patients seeking medical care, and the
second query revealed their demographic and clinical
features. We performed the survey according to the stan-
dardized procedure proposed by the Research Committee
on Epidemiology of Intractable Diseases in Japan. The
overall method was described previously [17]. The study
protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the
Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural
University of Medicine as representative, which was the
afﬁliation of the chair of the Research Committee on Idi-
opathic Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head in 2005.
We selected the survey targets from all the orthopaedic
departments in Japan by stratiﬁed random sampling. Two
hospital lists were used as the sampling frame: Byoin-
Yohran (primary use), and Iikukikan-Meibo (supplemen-
tary use) in Japanese. The lists are widely available in
electronic database form and list all the hospitals from north
to south in Japan. Stratiﬁcation was conducted according to
the number of hospital beds. Sampling fractions were as
follows: general hospitals with 99 or fewer beds (5%); 100
to 199 beds (10%); 200 to 299 beds (20%); 300 to 399 beds
(40%); 400 to 499 beds (80%); 500 or more beds (100%);
and university hospitals (100%). For example, regarding a
strata of general hospitals with 200 to 299 beds, we ran-
domly selected one orthopaedic department and then
selected the next one by a ﬁve-department interval, yielding
20% of the sampling fraction. Forty-six departments that
treated a large number of patients with idiopathic ONFH
were included by 100% of sampling fractions.
We began the ﬁrst query in January 2005. The selected
departments for survey targets were asked by mail to report
the total number and gender of patients who visited for
idiopathic ONFH from January 1 to December 31, 2004.
Because we did not collect information other than the total
number and gender of patients seen in the department,
informed consent was not obtained in the ﬁrst query. In the
ﬁrst query, 999 departments were sampled as survey targets
from 4722 intended departments in Japan, and 577
departments (58%) responded. We received reports for
5612 patients with idiopathic ONFH from 327 departments
that conﬁrmed they had a patient(s).
The diagnosis of idiopathic ONFH was based on the
revised criteria proposed by the Research Committee on
Idiopathic Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head in Japan [22].
Brieﬂy, the criteria comprise ﬁve ﬁndings: (1) collapse of
the femoral head (including crescent sign) without joint
2716 Fukushima et al. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research1

space narrowing or acetabular abnormality on radiographic
images; (2) demarcating sclerosis in the femoral head
without joint space narrowing or acetabular abnormality;
(3) ‘‘cold in hot’’ on bone scans; (4) low-intensity band on
T1-weighted MRI (band-like pattern); and (5) trabecular
and marrow necrosis on histology. Idiopathic ONFH was
diagnosed if the patient fulﬁlled two of these ﬁve ﬁndings
and did not have bone tumors or dysplasia. These criteria
for diagnosis had 91% sensitivity and 99% speciﬁcity when
histologic diagnosis was used as the gold standard [23].
Although steroids and alcohol are known risk factors, we
regarded steroid-induced osteonecrosis and alcohol-
induced osteonecrosis as idiopathic ONFH in our survey
because their causal mechanisms have not been fully
established. A reminder letter was sent in March to
departments that had not returned answers.
Accounting for the selection rate and response rate to
the survey, we estimated the total number of patients
seeking medical care according to the following formula:
the estimated total numbers of patients = reported number
of patients/(selection rate 9 response rate) = reported
number of patients/(number of reporting departments/
number of total departments). Additionally, the 95% con-
ﬁdence interval (CI) was calculated with an assumption of
multinominal hypergeometric distribution [6, 7, 17].
If a department responded that it had a patient(s) in the
ﬁrst query, we sent a second query consisting of structured
questionnaire (Appendix 1, English translation of the ori-
ginal form; Appendix 2, in Japanese as the original form)
to collect data regarding clinical characteristics of each
patient. The questionnaire consisted of the following items:
gender, date of birth, date of disease onset, date of disease
diagnosis, presence of abnormal ﬁndings at the time of
diagnosis (hip radiograph, bone scintigram, MRI, bone
biopsy), type and stage of disease, potential causative
factors (history of systemic steroid administration, history
of habitual alcohol drinking, both histories, neither of the
histories), underlying illness for which the patient received
steroid therapy (in case of a positive history of systemic
steroid administration), date of operation, and operative
procedure. To reduce the efforts of physicians in each of
the departments, and to sample approximately 50% of total
cases, we asked for information for patients born in odd
months. In the second query, of the 327 departments that
conﬁrmed they had a patient(s) in the ﬁrst query, 178
departments (46%) provided detailed data for 1616
patients. Patients with even-numbered birth months
(n = 31), whose ﬁrst visit to a department was in 2005
(n = 18), who were regarded as having secondary ONFH
based on information from the questionnaire (n = 55),
whose last visit was in 2003 or earlier (n = 8), and for
whom there was a later request for exclusion from the
participating departments (n = 2), also were excluded.
Consequently, we obtained detailed clinical characteristics
for 1502 subjects in the second query.
The working group of the Research Committee on Idi-
opathic Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head in Japan
proposed the revised classiﬁcation of disease types and
stages in 2002, which has been widely used in Japan since
its introduction (Table 1) [22]. Thus, we asked physicians
in each of the departments to apply the new classiﬁcation
even if the diagnosis was established earlier than 2002.
Brieﬂy, necrotic lesions were classiﬁed into four types (A,
B, C-1, and C-2) based on their location on T1-weighted
MRI or radiographic ﬁndings. Staging (1, 2, 3A, 3B, and 4)
was deﬁned by AP and lateral views of the femoral head on
radiographic images such as demarcating sclerosis, col-
lapse of the femoral head (including crescent sign), or
osteoarthritic changes.
In the second query, we also sent reminder letters to
departments that had not responded. Additionally, we
asked the departments that had responded to conﬁrm or
revise ﬁll-ins if the previously returned questionnaire had
missing information or lacked consistency. Although
detailed information regarding clinical characteristics was
collected in the second query, informed consent was not
obtained from each patient because anonymity was main-
tained throughout the second query. Only the department,
and not the investigators, could identify the patient if they
were asked to conﬁrm or revise ﬁll-ins. If there were
missing data even after conﬁrmation or revision, the data
were considered as ‘‘not ﬁlled-in’’.
Results
Based on the results from the ﬁrst query, we estimated that
the number of patients who sought medical care during
2004 was 11,400 (95% CI: 10,100–12,800). Of the 1408
patients with available information on the date of diagnosis
in the second query, 275 (19.5%) were newly diagnosed
during 2004. If these patients were regarded as new
patients, the number of new patients per year was estimated
to be 2200 (11,400 9 0.195), taking into account the
results of the ﬁrst query.
Among 1502 subjects whose detailed information was
obtained in the second query, the peak in age distribution
occurred in the 40s (Fig. 1). The gender ratio (male/female)
was 1.4 (820/582). In male subjects, the peak in age dis-
tribution also occurred in the 40s, whereas in females, the
peak occurred in the 30s. The potential causative factors of
ONFH were: systemic steroid administration (steroid-
induced) (51%); habitual alcohol use (alcohol-induced)
(31%); steroid and alcohol use (3%); and neither steroid nor
alcohol use (15%) (Table 2). The frequency of steroid-
induced ONFH was lower among males than females (34%

123
vs 76%), whereas the frequency of alcohol-induced ONFH
was greater among males than females (47% vs 6%).
Stratiﬁcation by age group (\ 40, 40-64, or C 65 years at
diagnosis) indicated a higher frequency of systemic steroid
administration in patients younger than 40 years (60%).
However, patients with no history of steroid or alcohol use
were frequently elderly (41%). Distribution of disease types
and stages showed that the most frequent type was C-2 and
the most frequent stage was 2 or 3A (Table 3). There was no
remarkable ﬂuctuation after stratiﬁcation by gender or age
group, except for a relatively higher frequency of Stage 4 in
the elderly. Of the 1323 joints with operations, hip
replacement was the most frequently performed, followed
by osteotomy (Table 4). Among patients younger than
40 years, a relatively greater number received an osteotomy
(38%). However, hip replacement also was performed for
45 % of patients in this age group. Systemic lupus erythe-
matosus (SLE) was the most frequent underlying illnesses
for the patients with steroid-induced ONFH (Table 5).
Discussion
We believe it is important to track and update the epide-
miology of a disease throughout a country, because such
observations may provide information for better under-
standing of the disease. We therefore determined: (1) the
annual number of patients seeking medical care and num-
ber of patients newly diagnosed; and (2) the distribution of
the age and gender of the patients, potential causative
factors, severity of the disease, and operative procedures
performed.
Several limitations of this study should be considered
before interpreting the results. First, larger teaching insti-
tutions represented higher percentages of the survey
targets, as these institutions were likely to have more

experience diagnosing or treating idiopathic ONFH.
However, large teaching institutions may be more likely to
perform osteotomies, whereas small community hospitals
may be more likely to perform hip replacement or provide
nonoperative treatment. Our sampling procedure, therefore,
may have led to different treatment strategies that did not
accurately reﬂect the entire population in Japan. Second,
the validity of the estimated number of patients is impor-
tant because the response rate was only 58% in the ﬁrst
query. However, the simple formula used for estimation in
this survey would be the most acceptable when investiga-
tors have no available information regarding nonresponse
facilities [6]. Third, our survey had no deﬁnition concern-
ing steroid-induced ONFH or alcohol-induced ONFH,
which might have produced considerable misclassiﬁcation.
In previous studies, steroid-induced ONFH was deﬁned by
a history of taking 1800 mg prednisolone or an equivalent
over 4 weeks, or by a history of continuous corticosteroid
medication for at least 2 months [2, 9, 10]. Similarly, some
authors classiﬁed alcohol-induced ONFH by having a
history of greater than 400 mL or 800 mL of pure ethanol
consumption per week [2, 4, 9–11]. However, even less
alcohol consumption or a lower steroid dose would
increase the risk of idiopathic ONFH [20], and the causal
mechanisms of these factors have not been fully proven.
Fourth, the patients included in our survey were prevalent
cases (new and old patients), not incident cases (new
patients), because the reported subjects were patients
seeking medical care during one year previous. Together,
with the speculation that patients with collagen disease
tend to seek medical treatment without interruption, these
factors make it possible to overestimate the frequency of
so-called steroid-induced ONFH. Finally, complications of
osteonecrosis other than of the femoral head were a con-
cern [4]. We could not assess this possibility because
diagnostic imaging for detecting another site of osteone-
crosis was not obtained in 42% of the subjects. However,
the prevalence of multifocal osteonecrosis among patients
with osteonecrosis was reportedly 3% [11]. Thus, the
impact of this complication on the estimates likely would
be small.
The ﬁrst query of this survey provided an estimation of
the annual number of patients seeking medical care
(11,400; 95% CI: 10,100–12,800) and the number of new
patients per year (2200) during 2004. These estimates
indicated the current disease burden of idiopathic ONFH in
Japan. To the best of our knowledge, no similar investi-
gation has been reported for other countries. Although in
one study the number of new cases in the United States has
been estimated to be 10,000 to 20,000 per year, this esti-
mate was based on the number of total joint arthroplasties
performed annually [13]. A previous nationwide epidemi-
ologic survey in Japan estimated the annual number of
patients seeking medical care during 1994 as 7400 (95%
CI: 6700–8200) [1], which suggested a substantial increase
in patients of 1.5 times over the previous 10 years. How-
ever, we are not certain it is appropriate to conclude the
occurrence of idiopathic ONFH has increased, based on the
following arguments: (1) in Japan, idiopathic ONFH
became a well-known disease after it was designated for
ﬁnancial support in 1992 and the emphasis may have
resulted in greater reporting; (2) diagnostic techniques
advanced substantially with the introduction of MRI and
more cases are likely being diagnosed; and (3) medical
staff have became more aware of ONFH development with
systemic steroid administration in parallel with better rec-
ognition of steroid-induced ONFH. Furthermore, the
improvement in the prognosis of underlying illnesses by
steroid therapy, ironically, might result in a greater accu-
mulation of patients with steroid-induced ONFH.
The results of the second query revealed the following
clinical characteristics of idiopathic ONFH in Japan: (1)
the distribution of ages of patients at diagnosis had a peak
in the 40s; (2) the gender ratio (male/female) was 1.4; (3)
systemic steroid administration was the most frequently
reported potential causative factor; (4) Type C-2, Stages 2
and 3A were common ﬁndings at diagnosis; (5) hip
replacement was the most frequently performed procedure,
followed by osteotomy; and (6) SLE was the most

peak in age distribution was almost identical to previous
ﬁndings [1, 3, 15]. Additionally, our surveys suggested
patients younger than 40 years accounted for one-third of
all subjects. Among this age group, steroid use was the
most prominent causative factor, and hip replacement was
still frequently performed. These ﬁndings conﬁrm the
importance of preventive strategies among the younger
population, with focus on the method of steroid admin-
istration, especially for SLE. Treatment strategies in
relation to joint preservation should be developed as well,
because current hip prostheses are unlikely to function
sufﬁciently through the remaining life expectancy of
younger patients [15]. A higher proportion of patients
with no history of steroid or alcohol use was observed
among those 65 years or older. Exploring other causative
factors would contribute to understanding the etiology of
the disease. Finally, our ﬁndings indicated that gender
distribution would reﬂect the potential causative factors of
ONFH, to some extent. Together with the fact that there
currently is no universal deﬁnition of steroid-induced or
alcohol-induced ONFH, simple stratiﬁcation by gender
may be an efﬁcient way to handle the variability of the
potential causative factors among different study
populations.
This survey provides an estimate of the disease burden
in Japan. Our results conﬁrmed the importance of devel-
oping preventive and treatment strategies, especially
among the younger population. Large epidemiologic sur-
veys in other countries would allow comparison with our
observations.
