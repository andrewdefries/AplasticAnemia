In 1935 it was reported from this laboratory that monkeys given
a diet deficient in some factor of the vitamin B complex developed an
anemia, leukopenia, and in many cases gingivitis and diarrhea, and
that all animals receiving such a diet died from the deficiency (1).
The syndrome was prevented by supplementing the det~cient diet
with yeast or a liver extract (2). We have recently reported the
failure of nicotinic acid to prevent this nutritional cytopenia (3).
It is the purpose of this paper to describe the manifestations of this
deficiency, and to present evidence showing that the syndrome is
not a result of a deficiency of any of the chemically known vitamins.
We have proposed the designation vitamin M for the substance in
yeast and liver which prevents nutritional cytopenia in the monkey (3).
Anemiashave been producedexperimentallyin a number of speciesby dietary
deficiency. Willsand Bilimoria (4), Wills and Stewart (5), and Johnstone and
Reed (6) have produced anemias in monkeysby dietary means. Rhoads and
Miller (7, 8) have reported the irregularappearanceofan anemiain dogsfed a diet
productive of chronicblack tongue and "apparently lacking a substance closely
associatedwith vitamin B~G." Spiesand Dowling(9) have alsonoted an anemia

in dogs on a black tongue-producing diet. Miller and Rhoads (8, 10) have further
reported that a certain number of the dogs placed on their black tongue-producing
diet developed "an ulcerative stomatitis associated with leucopenia and granulo-
penia." Gy~rgy el al. (11) have produced a somewhat similar syndrome in rats
on a diet deficient in some component of the vitamin B complex. More recently
he has reported (12) that nicotinic acid prevented this nutritional disturbance.
Hogan et al. (13) have reported the development of a nutritional anemia in the
pigeon and have stated that this condition did not yield to treatment with ribo-
flavin, vitamin B, or an antidermatitis (rat) concentrate, but did respond to the
administration of certain curative agents. Fouts a al. (14, 15) reported that a
rice polish extract rich in vitamin B6 supplemented a purified diet and prevented
the appearance of a severe microcytic hypochromic anemia and death in puppies.
Gall (16) and Miller and Rhoads (17) reported that guinea pigs seem to require
some one or more substances in the diet for normal hematopoiesis. Kyer and
Bethell (18) reported that a nutritional anemia in the rat might be prevented by the
administration of a vitamin B4 concentrate.
EXPERIMENTAL
Young immature monkeys (Macaca mulatta) weighing approximately 2 kilos
were purchased from animal dealers. Upon arrival they were given a mixed diet
consisting of grains, bread, fresh vegetables and fruits, and dried dog food. Dur-
ing a preliminary period of observation of at least 3 weeks, any animals that
showed diarrhea, cough, anorexia, or other symptoms which did not abate shortly
were discarded. Those animals which appeared to be normal were then separated,
weighed, and bled. After this preliminary period of observation at least two blood
counts were taken on each monkey before it was placed on an experimental diet.
Some of the animals were in our laboratory more than a year before they were
started on experiment; during this period each gained approximately 1 kilo in
weight.
After an animal was found to be normal it was started on the experimental
diet and thereafter was weighed and examined, and blood was drawn for study at
weekly intervals, or oftener as the nature of the experiment or condition of the
animal required. Some animals were bled daily near death or after the adminis-
tration of a supplement to the deficient diet. The monkeys were kept in large
metal metabolism cages with wire mesh bottoms. No effort was made to prevent
coprophagy. The monkeys were housed in a light, airy room, but no attempt was
made to expose them to direct sunlight. The temperature of the room was main-
tained as nearly constant as was possible; the room was heated continuously in
winter, and the temperature rarely fell below 20°C. Clean tap water was kept
in the cages at all times. The animals were fed once a day, usually about noon,
but never before blood was drawn on that particular day. Weighings were made
by placing the monkey in a tared cage on a direct reading balance. The tech-
niques for blood determinations were the same as those described elsewhere (19).
W. C. LANGSTON, W. ~[. DARB¥, C. F. SttUKERS, P. L. DAY 92S
Normal animals on a mixed diet were usually kept in the same room simul-
taneously with the experimental animals. In none of these have we ever observed
a symptom complex resembling in any way that produced in our experimental
animals. That the hygienic conditions in our quarters are satisfactory for the
monkey is evident from the fact that we have kept certain animals in our lab-
oratory for more than 2 years, and they have remained in good health and de-
veloped normally.
The experimental diet (No. 600) has been altered only slightly from that previ-
ously reported (1). In recent years we have used somewhat larger monkeys and
hence felt it advisable to increase the caloric intake. Vitamin C is now supplied in
the form of tablets of ascorbic add (Merck), and in our more recent experiments
a more complete salt mixture has been used (20). The quantities fed each monkey
per day were as follows:
gm,
Casein, washed with dilute alcohol~................................. 10
Rice, polished, uncoated........................................... 50
Ground whole wheat.............................................. 15
Salt mixture, Hubbell, Mendel, and Wakemau (20)................... 3
Sodium chloride.................................................. 2
Cod liver oil..................................................... 3
Ascorbie acid (Merck) ............................................ 0.01
The casein, rice, salt mixture, and salt were mixed in an enameled boiler and
tap water was added. This mixture was cooked on a steam bath with frequent
stirring for 1½hours. The whole wheat was then added and the cooking continued
for ½ hour longer. The diet was then cooled in front of a fan, and the cod liver
oil was mixed with the cooled material. The diet was cooked fresh every second
day and was stored in a refrigerator until used. The aseorbic acid was fed sepa-
rately in the form of tablets which the monkeys ate readily. Thiamin chloride
was fed to one monkey in the same way. The monkey which was given extralin
received 4 pulvules of this preparation before its basal diet, and consumed them
readily. All other orally administered supplements were mixed with the diet just
before feeding.
The diet, as it was given to the monkeys, had the consistency of a thick paste
or mush, and was fed in earthenware dishes. Each animal was offered the amount
of diet indicated above and in nearly every case the entire portion was eaten.
In a few animals it was necessary to develop a taste for the diet by mixing a small
amount of fresh banana with the portion for the first 3 or 4 days, after which they
readily ate the diet without the banana. When a supplement was added and the
monkey did not eat all of its diet, the amount of basal diet was decreased somewhat
to make certain that all of the supplement was consumed.

The ingredients, except for the cottonseed oil, cod liver oil, and ascorbic acid,
were cooked in an enameled boiler for 2 hours. After cooling, the cottonseed oil
and cod liver oil were added. The ascorbic acid was fed separately. The monkey
was cared for in the same way as were animals on the other diet.
:RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Since space does not permit the presentation of complete hemato-
logical data on all of the animals, we are giving in Table I the data
on individual animals at the most critical points in the experiments.
Hematological data on normal monkeys under the conditions existing
in this laboratory have been presented elsewhere (19), but for ready
reference the average normal figures and the normal ranges for blood
elements are repeated at the beginning of Table I. The text-figures
give somewhat more complete results on 5 of the monkeys. In the
following paragraphs the data are discussed.
Deficient D/et.--Monkeys 13, 20, 22, 25, 26, and 30 received the
deficient diet alone (diet 600). In every case they showed the symp-
tom complex previously described: leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia,
and loss of weight. A decrease in packed cell volume (hematocrit)
was also seen. There also appeared to be a decrease in the number of
platelets, although the data for this blood element are more meager.
The dramatic increase in number of platelets to 1,555,000 per c.mm.
following the administration of yeast to monkey 27 (Text-fig. 4) would
also suggest that a thrombocytopenia is a part of the picture of this
nutritional deficiency. No consistent variation in the clotting time
has been observed. Ulceration of the gums and diarrhea were
less consistently seen than was the cytopenia. The gum ulceration,
as would be expected, appeared to be more closely correlated with

The degree of anemia seemed to vary somewhat with the animal. Erythrocyte
counts below 1,000,000 per c.mm. have been found; however, the counts were more
frequently around 3,000,000 at or before death. The decrease in hemoglobin
appeared to parallel the decrease in erythrocytes. Hence, the color index did not
vary greatly from normal for the monkey. The packed cell volume also paralleled
the erythrocyte numbers, so the volume index did not depart significantly from
normal. A few of the animals died before the anemia had become marked.
The average total white blood cell count for the monkey (15,000 per c.mm.)
is considerably above that of man. Therefore, a total white cell count of 5000 or
less would indicate a definite leukopenic state. Several of the monkeys on the

deficient diet exhibited before death white cell counts of less than 1000 per c.mm.
The most frequent finding, however, was a total white count of approximately
3000 ceils per c.mm. Usually, but not always, there was a relative granulocyto-
penia. It is suggestive that those animals which survived the deficiency for the
longest periods also tended to maintain the normal relativedistribution of granu-
locytes and lymphocytes. That the leukopenia was not the result of the gingival
infection is suggested by the fact that we have frequently seen animals die with
very low white cell counts without showing gum lesions. The converse has not
been true, however. Usually the leukopenia appeared to precede shortly the
anemia.
Terminal rises in the numbers of all cellular elements have sometimes been

T~x~-FI~. 4. Blood picture of monkey 27. This animal was given the deficient diet
supplemented with 10 gm. of skim milk powder daily. A mild anemia and distinct leuko-
penia had developed by the 34th day. At this point the milk powder was discontinued
and replaced by 10 gm. of dried yeast daily. There was an immediate increase in
reticulocytes and platelets and the entire blood picture slowly returned to normal.

TExT-FIG. 5. Hematological and weight data on monkey 32, which received the de-
ficient diet supplemented with 2 gin. of Lily's liver extract daily. The animal gained
in weight and developed normally, and at the end of 2 years the blood picture was still
normal. At this time the liver extract was withdrawn, and the animal died in 72 days
showing the typical symptoms of weight loss, leukopenia, and ulceration of the gums.

seen in the last two or three days of life. These rises have never increased the
counts to normal values, however. They may possibly be explained by dehydra-
tion of the moribund animal.
Black Tongue-ProducingD/et.--Monkey 28 was fed the modified Goldberger
diet. It also developed a severe leukopenia and anemia, with marked ulceration
of the gums and a diarrhea. In contrast with the results of Miller and Rhoads
in dogs (7, 10) and in swine (24) there appeared to be no tendency to spontaneous
remission. Likewise, we have never observed a spontaneous remission in any
monkey on diet 600. Also, in contrast with the findings of 1Lhoadsand Miller in
dogs (7), we have not observed a significant consistent change in either the color
index or the volume index in this deficiency in the monkey. Further study will be
necessary to determine whether these differences are due to variations in the
response of the several species to the same deficiency, or whether the conditions
are manifestations of deficiencies of distinct nutritional factors.
Although it is logical to assume that the blood changes in monkeys
on our diet 600 and on this modified black tongue-producing diet are
the result of the same deficiency, this point remains to be proved.
Experiments are under way to determine the effect of supplementing
the black tongue-producing diet with nicotinic acid. The blood
findings on the 2 monkeys reported by Johnstone and Reed (6) are
strikingly similar to those which we observed.
Yeast.--Monkey 24 was given the deficient diet supplemented with 10 gin. of
dried brewers' yeast (vita-food, red label). The animal gained in weight and size,
and dentition proceeded normally. After 200 days the blood picture was still
normal; at that time the amount of yeast was reduced to 5 gm. daily. On the
429th clay the blood picture was still normal, and at that time the daily amount of
yeast was reduced to 2.5 gm. Following that reduction the monkey developed a
severe cytopenia and died on the 655th day, showing the following terminal values:
total white cells, 4100 per c.mm.; platelets, 55,000 per c.mm.; erythrocytes,
1,610,000 per cram.; hemoglobin, 5.7 gm. per 100 cc.; and packed cell volume,
18.5 per cent. 5 days before death the daily dosage of yeast was increased to 10
gm. This was followed by an increase in reticulocytes to 4.3 per cent, but the
increased amount of yeast did not prevent death. Although 2.5 gm. of yeast daily
did not prevent the deficiency manifestations, that amount did appear to prolong
life. It appears, therefore, that the m~nlmum protective dose of this preparation
of dried brewers' yeast was between 2.5 and 5 gin. daily.
Monkey 27 was started on experiment with the deficient diet supplemented with
10 gm. of skim milk powder daily (see Table I and Text-fig. 4). By the 34th
day a mild cytopenia had developed. At this point the milk powder was replaced
by 10 gm. of dried brewers' yeast daily. As can be seen by an inspection of
Text-fig. 4, there was a sharp rise in reticulocytes to 4 per cent and a simultaneous
934 NUTRITIONAL CYTOPENIA IN THE MONKEY
increase in platelets to 1,555,000 per c.mm~ There was a slower return of white
ceils, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and packed cell volume to normal levels. On the
596th day the blood picture was still normal.
It is evident from these two experiments that brewers' yeast con-
tains a factor which is essential in the maintenance of proper hemato-
poietic function in the monkey. In su~cient quantities yeast is able
to prevent nutritional cytopenia in the monkey, and must therefore be
regarded as a reliable source of vitamin M.
Liver Extraa.--The effectiveness of several liver preparations in the prevention
of nutritional cytopenia was studied. Monkey 32 was given the deficient diet
supplemented with 2 gin. of LiUy's liver extract (343 powder), which is essentially
Cohn's fraction G (25). The animal gained in weight and height, and the blood
picture was still normal at the end of 2 years. At the start of the experiment
the monkey was juvenile, but during the experiment it passed puberty and began
to menstruate. Dentition proceeded normally with the loss of deciduous teeth
and the eruption of permanent teeth. At the end of the second year the liver
extract was withdrawn. The animal died in 72 days following the withdrawal
of the liver extract, after showing loss of weight, a marked leukopenia, and ulcera-
tion of the gums. Monkey 29 was given the diet supplemented with 4 pulvules of
extralin, a liver-stomach preparation. This animal gained in weight and height,
dentition proceeded normally, and the blood picture was still normal at the end of
572 days. The monkey developed a paralysis of unknown etiology during the
latter part of the experiment; this paralysis will be discussed later.
Monkey 34 was given the deficient diet supplemented with 1 cc. per week of
Lederle liver extract parenterally. This dosage was based upon the amount of the
extract necessary to keep a pernicious anemia patient in remission. The monkey
developed the severe leukopenia and anemia typical of vitamin M deficiency,
and died on the 105th day. On the day before death the total white cells num-
bered 1600 per c.mm., and the total erythrocyte count was 2,690,000 per c.mm.
It is apparent that this amount of Lederle liver solution did not protect against
nutritional cytopenia. One of the animals (monkey 40) was given a concentrate
from Lilly's liver extract prepared according to the method of Dakin, Ungley,
and West (26) after a marked cytopenia had developed. Although this was fol-
lowed by an increase in reficulocytes to 2.4 per cent, the condition of the animal
became progressivelyworse and it died on the 122nd day.
It is evident from the experiments on monkeys 29 and 32 that cer-
tain liver extracts given orally were effective in preventing nutritional
cytopenia over long periods of time, and as supplements to the deficient
diet were capable of promoting normal growth and development.
W. C. LANGSTON, W. J. DARBY, C. 1~. SII-UKERS, P. L. DAY 93~
The experiments with more concentrated preparations of the anti-
pernicious anemia factor were less conclusive.
Ribofladn.--It seemed possible that nutritional cytopenia might be the result
of a deficiency of riboflavin; consequently, the effectiveness of synthetic riboflavin
was investigated. Diet 600 contains some riboflavin in the whole wheat, but rats
on a similar diet containing 35 per cent whole wheat eventually developed the
characteristic signs of flavin deficiency (27).
The requirement of the monkey for riboflavin is a matter of conjecture only.
Estimates of the human requirement have been from 400 Bourquin-Sherman units
for children to 600 units for adults (28). Accepting the tentative conversion
factor of 1 unit as equivalent to between 2 and 3 micrograms of riboflavin (29, 30),
the human requirement would be between 1 and 2 rag. of riboflavin daily. The
requirement of a young 2 kilo monkey should be considerably less. We therefore
decided to give 1 rag. of synthetic riboflavin daily to certain monkeys as supple-
ments to the deficient diet. 4 monkeys (36, 42, 44, and 45) were given this dosage
either alone or in combination with nicotinic acid, or with nicotinic acid and
thiamin chloride. The riboflavin was supplied to us in sterile ampules, each con-
taining 1 rag. riboflavin in 2 cc. of solution. Monkey 36 was given the riboflavin
mixed with the basal diet. The somewhat bitter taste of the riboflavin seemed
to render the diet unpalatable, however, so the method of administration was
changed and the riboflavin was given subcutaneously during the latter part of the
experiment. The other 3 animals received it subcutaneously throughout the
experiment. Monkey 44 was also given 10 mg~of nicotinic acid daily mixed with
the basal diet (Text-fig. 2). Monkey 45 received 50 rag. of nicotinic acid daily,
while monkey 42 received 50 mg. of nicotinic acid and 1 rag. of thiamin chloride
daily, in addition to the riboflavin.
It is evident from the data given in Table I on these 4 animals that riboflavin,
either alone or in combination with nicotinic acid or with nicotinic acid and thia-
rn|n chloride, did not prolong life or prevent a marked leukopenia. It is possible
that the riboflavin tended to sustain the hemoglobin and erythrocyte numbers,
since monkey 36 did not develop an anemia. This would not be surprising in
view of the reported value of riboflavin in hemoglobin production (31). The other
3 monkeys showed a distinct anemia, however, and the sustained erythrocyte
numbers and hemoglobin in monkey 36 can probably be explained by two facts:
this animal was somewhat larger (3.5 kilos) than most of our animals, and the
survival period was shorter. We have observed that the anemia appears to
develop more slowly than the leukopenia, and that larger monkeys die before they
show more than moderate anemia.
Monkey 45 was given 0.5 gin. of yeast nucleic acid daily after marked cytopcnia
had developed. This was followed by a dramatic increase in leukocytes to a total
of 30,000 per c.mm. The animal died on the 77th day, nevertheless. At autopsy
numerous small abscesses were found throughout the wall of the intestine and in
certain other abdominal viscera. In the presence of this complication it is ira-
936 NUTRITIONAL CYTOPENIA IN THE ~ONKEY
possible to evaluate the r61e of the nucleic acid. Further investigation of this
substance is planned.
It is apparent that riboflavin, either alone or in combination with
nicotinic acid and thiamin chloride, was ineffective in the prevention
of nutritional cytopenia.
NicotinicAcid.--In another place (3) we have reported the failure of nicotinic
acid to prevent nutritional cytopenia in the monkey, and in that paper detailed
hematological data were given on 2 monkeys. Table I gives the most significant
results from the 6 monkeys which received nicotinic acid (monkeys 37, 40, 42, 43,
44, and 45) and Text-fig. 2 gives complete data on one of them. These data are
also discussed in the paragraph on riboflavin. Although it is conceivable that
nicotinic acid amide or some other pyridine derivatives might be effective, it is
clear that nicotinic acid is not identical with the substance that prevents nutri-
tional cytopenia in the monkey (vitamln M).
Copper.--Originally we used the salt mixture of Osborne and Mendel (23) as a
source of inorganic elements. This mixture furnishes abundant iron, but contains
copper only as it is incidentally found as a contaminant of the chemicals used.
Therefore, we gave one animal (monkey 31) the deficient diet prepared with this
salt mixture but supplemented with 5 rag. of copper daily as copper sulfate. It
developed a severe leukopenia (Table I) and marked necrosis of the gums (Figs.
2 and 3), but did not show the severe anemia which is commonly observed. Mon-
key 33 was then given the deficient diet without copper supplement and allowed
to develop a moderate anemia. At this point 5 rag. of copper daily was added
to the diet. There was no increase in erythrocytes and no reticulocyte response,
and the animal showed an erythrocyte count of 730,000 just before death.
Since October, 1937, all the animals used have received 3 gin. daily of the im-
proved salt mixture of Hubbell, Mendel, and Wakeman (20), and hence have
received more than 1 rag. of copper daily from this source alone. Moderately
severe anemia has appeared in approximately the same percentage of comparable
animals as was observed before the change in salt mixture, and one monkey has
exhibited a severe anemia since the change. No appreciable alteration of the total
white or differential counts has been observed since the change of salt mixture
and the consequent increase in copper content of the diet.
Although the apparent stimulating action on erythropoiesis of
moderately large doses of copper sulfate in the one animal requires
further investigation, the absence of any such stimulating action by
intakes within the suggested range of human requirement (32) and the
absence of any leukopoietic effect from any of the doses would indicate
that copper deficiency is certainly not the cause of the cytopenia.
General Discussion.--The anemia in puppies reported by Fours
W. C. LANGSTON, W. J. DAP~BY, C. l~. SHUKEI~S, P. L. DAY 937
and associates (14, 15) resulting from vitamin Be deficiency was de-
scribed as a microcytic anemia with no appreciable change in the
leukocyte counts. In contrast with that, the condition we are here
describing in monkeys appears to be a normocytic anemia accompanied
by a profound lowering of the number of leukocytes. The two con-
ditions therefore present distinctly different pathological pictures.
Furthermore, calculated on the basis of assays reported by Birch
et al. (33), our diet 600 contains approximately 28 "rat day doses"
of vitamin B6 per portion, and the modified Goldberger diet that we
used contains 80 or more rat day doses of this vitamin. On the other
hand, the amount of liver extract necessary to prevent nutritional
cytopenia in the monkey contains only 10 rat day doses of vitamin
Be, computed from data from the same laboratory. In the light of
the foregoing statements it appears quite improbable that a deficiency
of vitamin Be could be a causative factor in the production of nutri-
tional cytopenia in the monkey.
Since many of the monkeys ate well up to within a day or two of
death, we feel justified in concluding that the cytopenia was not the
result of simple inanition.
The experimentson monkeys24, 27, and 32 demonstrate that the quantity of
basal diet was adequate; all of thesesurvived more than 500 days on the usual
ration supplementedwith a small quantity of an active material (yeast or liver
extract), and their blood pictures remained normal. Monkey32 is of especial
interest in this connection. It receivedthe usual amount of basal diet plus 2 gin.
ofLiUy'sliver extract daily. On the 388thday it had reacheda maximumweight
of4295gin. Evidently the usual dailyration wasnot adequate to support growth
in such a largeanimal,for duringthe next 288 days the animal declinedin weight,
although the bloodpicture remainednormal. Consequently,the amount of basal
diet was doubledon the 677thday, and by the 728thday the animal had attained
a weightof 4955gin. (Text-fig.5). On this date the liver extract was withdrawn
but the double portion of basal diet was continued. The monkey died 72 days
after the withdrawalof the liver extract, having shownthe typical leukopeniaand
gingivallesionscharacteristicofvitamin M deficiency. Theseexperimentswould
seemto precludethe possibilitythat the cytopeniawas the result of an inadequate
caloricintake.
Monkey 27, which received 10 gin. of yeast daily, and monkey 29, which re-
ceived 4 pulvulesof extralin daily, developeda paralysis after they had been on
the experimentfor more than a year. Monkey29 was returned to a mixedstock
diet after the 572ndday, and within a short time the paralysis had disappeared;
938 NUTRITIONAL CYTOPENIA IN TIi-E MONKEY
this would suggest that a dietary factor may have been involved in the etiology
of the paralysis. Monkey 32 survivedfor 2 years on the basal diet supplemented
with 2 gm. of liver extract daily and did not showany evidenceof paralysis. We
have no explanation to offerfor the appearance of paralysis in these 2 monkeys,
but wishto recordthe observationsin the interest ofcompleteness.
Space will not permit a detailed comparison of these experiments
on the monkey with the other experimental anemias of dietary origin
described in the literature, but certain brief commentsmaybe appropri-
ate. One cannot avoid being impressed by the similarity of this
symptom complex to the anemia and leukopenia which Rhoads and
Miller have shown accompany black tongue in dogs (7, 8, 10). Also,
the condition reported by Wills and associates (4, 5) in monkeys
resembles in many ways the condition that we refer to as nutritional
cytopenia. However, their monkeys survived longer, the blood
changes appeared much later, and their animals appeared to develop
a more severe anemia but milder lenkopenia than our animals. Fur-
thermore, the anemia in their animals was reported to be macrocytic,
while the volume index and color index in our animals did not deviate
greatly from normal. The panmyelophthisis in rats reported by
Gy6rgy and associates (11) resembles nutritional cytopenia in the
monkey in so many ways that one might be inclined to believe they
had a common etiology, were it not that GySrgy has reported that
nicotinic acid prevented the blood changes in their rats (12).
Although the condition we designate as nutritional cytopenia in
many ways resembles certain clinical conditions, as agranulocytosis,
aplastic anemia, and possibly others, it is not identical in all respects
with any one of them. We feel that it is wise to defer the discussion
of these points of similarity and dissimilarity until more evidence
is available.
Su~rMA~Y
Young rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were given a diet con-
taining casein, polished rice, whole wheat, salt mixture, sodium
chloride, cod liver oil, and ascorbic acid. They developed a syndrome
characterized by anemia, leukopenia, and loss of weight. Ulceration
of the gums and diarrhea were common, and death occurred between
W. C. LANGSTON, W. J. DARBY, C. :F. SHUKERS, P. L. DAY 939
the 26th and 100th day. 4 monkeys were given the deficient diet
supplemented with 1 ~mg. of riboflavin daily, and these developed
the characteristic signs and died. in periods of time similar to the
survival of monkeys receiving the deficient diet alone. Nicotinic
acid, either alone or in combination with riboflavin and thiamin
chloride, failed to alter appreciably the course of the deficiency mani-
festations. Thus, it is evident that this nutritional cytopenia is not
the result of a deficiency of vitamin B, riboflavin, or nicotinic acid.
The deficient diet supplemented with either 10 gin. of dried
brewers' yeast or 2 gin. of liver extract (Cohn fraction G) daily sup-
ported good growth, permitted normal body development, and main-
tained a normal blood picture over long periods. It is obvious that
yeast and liver extract contain a substance essential to the nutrition
of the monkey which is not identical with any of those factors of the
vitamin B complex that have been chemically identified. We have
proposed the term vitamin M for this factor which prevents nutritional
cytopenia in the monkey.
