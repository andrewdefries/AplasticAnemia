INTRODUCTION
With improved survival following transplantation, increas-
ing importance is now being placed upon the long-term effects
of therapy including osteoporosis. Several reviews regarding
bone complications in transplanted patients have appeared in
the literature (1-5). Most of these works refer to renal, hepatic,
and cardiac transplants, whereas references to bone marrow
transplantation (BMT) remain scarce, especially about the
long-term changes in bone mineral metabolism. Bone diseases
following BMT show several differences from those following
other organ transplants. BMT recipients are relatively young
and the duration of immunosuppressive therapy is usually
short. The duration from diagnosis to BMT is relatively short,
and thus pre-transplant bone mineral density (BMD) in BMT
is higher than those in other solid organ transplantation (6).
However, loss of bone mineral density is usually detected
following BMT in short-term studies (6-9).
We previously reported one-year change of bone mineral
metabolism in which early bone loss is significant after BMT
(7). However, data on the long-term change of BMD following
BMT are rare. We observed the changes of yearly BMD during
the post-BMT 3 yr and found a unique pattern in the bone
loss and recovery according to the skeletal sites.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
We prospectively investigated 11 patients (5 females and
6 males) undergoing allogeneic BMT for hematologic diseases
(7 with leukemia, 3 with severe aplastic anemia, and 1 with
myelodysplastic syndrome). The mean age of patients was 28.7
±8.6 yr at the time of BMT (Table 1). Each patient received
high dose cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day) for two to four
days. Six patients also received total body irradiation (TBI, 10-
13.2 Gy) as a conditioning regimen. Intravenous cyclosporin
A was administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day one day before
BMT and at 3 mg/kg/day until the 20th day after BMT to the
patients in order to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
Thereafter, oral cyclosporin A at 6 mg/kg/day was begun and
continued for 6 to 12 months. Chronic GVHD developed in
3 patients. Established GVHD was treated with a combina-
tion of intravenous methylprednisolone or oral prednisolone
and cyclosporin A. Doses were tapered when GVHD was con-
trolled clinically.
During the 3-yr study period, pre-BMT and yearly BMD
were measured. BMDs of the lumbar spine (lumbar vertebrae
L2-L4) and of the total proximal femur were measured by
dual-energy radiography absorptiometry (DEXA) using a
Lunar Expert (Lunar, Madison, WI, U.S.A.). The precision

The Skeletal Site-Differential Changes in Bone Mineral Density
Following Bone Marrow Transplantation: 3-Year Prospective Study
Loss of bone mass is usually detected after bone marrow transplantation (BMT)
during the early post-transplant period. However, little is known about the long-term
effects of BMT on bone metabolism. We have prospectively investigated 11 patients
undergoing BMT. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured before BMT, and
1, 2, and 3 yr after BMT. Serum markers of bone turnover were serially measured
before BMT and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 yr after BMT. The mean
change in the lumbar spine (L2-4) BMD, calculated as the percent change from
the baseline to the level at 1, 2, and 3 yr was -4.7% (NS), -1.1% (NS), and +6.4%
(p<0.05), respectively. The mean change in the total proximal femur BMD from
the baseline to the level at 1, 2, and 3 yr was -8.5% (p<0.01), -8.7% (p<0.05) and
-5.6% (p<0.05), respectively. In summary, there was little decline in lumbar BMD
at 1 yr following BMT and gradual recovery until 3 yr. In contrast, femoral BMD
decreased much more than the lumbar area at 1 yr and did not recover until 3 yr.
The mechanism of skeletal site-selective differences in the changes of BMD needs
to be elucidated.

of the method (coefficient of variation) was 1.0% at both
locations.
Serum osteocalcin and carboxy-terminal cross-linked telopep-
tide of type I collagen (ICTP) were measured serially before
BMT and at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12 wk, 6 months, and 1 yr after
BMT. Serum osteocalcin (N-tact�
osteo SP, Incstar, U.S.A.)
and ICTP (Telopeptide ICTP, Orion Diagnostica, Finland)
were determined by radioimmunoassay. The maximum
inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation for the range
of concentrations evaluated were 7.7% and 5.4% for osteo-
calcin, and 10.7% and 3.6% for ICTP, respectively.
All women went into a menopausal state immediately after
BMT and remained amenorrhea. In these female patients, hor-
mone replacement therapy was administered from 1 yr after
BMT. This study was approved by the Institutional Review
BoardofSt.Mary’sHospitalandinformedconsentwasobtained
from all the participants.
Study design
Wilcoxon’s signed rank test was used to analyze the thyroid
hormoneparametersandcytokineprofilesinmatchedpairsdur-
ing the pre- and post-transplant period. The Mann-Whitney U
test was used to compare the thyroid hormone levels according
to TBI or steroid doses. Correlation between thyroid hormone
and cytokine levels were assessed using the Spearman rank test.
A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS
Three-year changes of bone mineral density
The mean changes in the lumbar spine (L2-4) BMD, calcu-
lated as the percent change from the baseline to the level at
1, 2, and 3 yr were -4.7% (statistically not significant, NS),
-1.1% (NS), and +6.4% (p<0.05), respectively. The mean
changes in the total proximal femur BMD from baseline to the
level at 1, 2, and 3 yr were -8.5% (p<0.01), -8.7% (p<0.05),
and -5.6% (p<0.05), respectively (Fig. 1).
According to the GVHD occurrence, the GVHD group (n=3)
had significantly more bone loss in femoral bone than the non-
GVHDgroup(n=8),butnotinlumbarspine.Themeanchanges
of total femoral BMD in GVHD vs non-GVHD patients were
-15.0%vs-5.9%at1yr(p<0.05),-12.4%vs-5.1%at2yr(NS),
and -9.8% vs -3.8% at 3 yr (p<0.05), respectively. The mean
changes of lumbar BMD in GVHD vs non-GVHD patients
were -10.0% vs -2.0% at 1 yr (NS), -10.3% vs 5.3% at 2 yr
(p<0.05),and+3.9%vs+5.9%at3yr(NS),respectively(Fig.2).

Changes of biochemical markers
The serum ICTP increased progressively until four weeks after
BMT. Thereafter, it began to decrease and reached basal values
after one year (pre-BMT 7.4±1.6 ng/mL, post-BMT 4 wk
11.1±3.2 ng/mL, post-BMT 1 yr 8.3±0.8 ng/mL). Serum
osteocalcin decreased progressively until three weeks after
BMT. Thereafter, it recovered back to its initial basal level by
12 months (pre-BMT 3.6±1.9 ng/mL, post-BMT 3 wk 2.0
±0.8 ng/mL, post-BMT 1 yr 4.6±0.9 ng/mL) (Fig. 5).

Changes of estradiol, testosterone, and gonadotropin
levels
After 6 months after BMT, in female patients, serum LH
and FSH increased significantly and serum estradiol tended
to decrease, but without statistical significance (LH; from 6.6
±4.9 IU/L to 38.7±9.3 IU/L, FSH; from 10.0±6.9 IU/L
to 74.9±6.3 IU/L, estradiol; from 62.3±7.0 pmol/L to 24.9
±0.3 pmol/L) (Fig. 6). In male patients, serum LH, FSH, and
testosterone levels did not change significantly after BMT
(Fig. 7).
DISCUSSION
Previous studies have demonstrated a 30 to 35% increase
of the incidence of lumbar fracture following heart and liver
transplantation and an 8 to 17% loss of BMD within 1 yr fol-
lowing kidney transplantation (1-5). However, little is known
about the effect of BMT on the skeletal system. In their cross-
sectional studies, Kelly et al. (8) and Bhatia et al. (11) reported
a significant decrease in bone density at the lumbar spine and
femoral neck in a group of subjects following allogeneic BMT
Recently, Ebeling et al. also found that post-allogeneic BMT
patients lost 11.7% of femoral neck BMD and 3.9% of lum-
bar BMD during the post-BMT 1 yr (9). We also previously
reported significant bone loss following BMT and found that
femoral bone loss was greater than vertebral bone loss in 67
patients during the post-BMT 1 yr (10).
In this study, we observed the serial BMD change during
the post-BMT 3 yr and found that the change was different
between vertebral and femoral bone. The initial femoral bone
loss was more prominent than vertebral bone loss during the
post-BMT 1 yr. Furthermore, most of vertebral bone loss fol-
lowing BMT was recovered during post-BMT 3 yr, but the
femoral bone loss was not recovered. Similar results were shown
in other short-term studies on bone mineral metabolism after
BMT (11, 12). Schulte et al. reported that initial 6 months
were important period in post-BMT bone loss and they ob-
served much lower rate in bone loss after 1 yr in the 2-yr
prospective study (13). In their study, partial recovery of spine
BMD was also demonstrated, but not femoral compartments,
which was consistent with our study. However, the study for
longer period in a prospective manner following BMT has not
been reported, to our knowledge. Although the number of
patients in this study was small, this was the first study to
observe the serial changes of BMD during the post-BMT 3-yr
period. Exact mechanisms for this site-selectivity need to be
elucidated, but it may be partly due to the differences in the
tissue expression of several proteins related to bone metabolism
including certain growth factors and BMP-2 according to the
skeletal site (14, 15). The BMD response to therapeutic agents
(e.g. bisphosphonate and hormone replacement therapy) is
also different between lumbar and femoral bone, but the clear
mechanism for this is currently unknown (16-18).
In this study, patients with GVHD or TBI tended to expe-
rience more bone loss than those without GVHD or TBI. If
more subjects were included in the study, the differences accord-
ing to these risk factors could be greater to reach statistical
significance. Patients suffering from GVHD receive larger
amounts of immunosuppressive agents and thus have higher
risk of bone loss. GVHD itself might have negative effect
on bone marrow microenvironment in which bone turnover
actually takes place (19). Because osteoblasts and osteoclasts
are present in bone marrow, transplant-related stromal injury
and cytokine changes in addition to GVHD itself might be
related to post-BMT bone loss (20). We previously reported
that the increase of bone marrow interleukin-6 was significant-
ly associated with bone resorption after BMT (20). TBI can
induce hypogonadism especially in women and may cause
growth hormone deficiency, both of which are well known
risk factors of osteoporosis.
The cause of significant increase in lumbar BMD at post-
BMT 3 yr compared to basal values is uncertain, but gradual

recovery of stromal cell function might partly contribute to
it. Gradual reduction in the doses of immunosuppressants
could be one of the main causes. It seems that continuous
estrogen replacement might also contribute to this increase
in lumbar BMD, but this is probably not the dominant cause
for it because male subjects also experienced the similar rates
of increase in lumbar BMD without hormone replacement
therapy.
The women had a tendency to experience more bone loss
than men, especially in vertebral bone. This may be related
to hypogonadism induced by BMT in women, but not in men.
Thus, female patients received cyclic estrogen and progesterone
replacement therapy since 1 yr after BMT and experienced
gradual recovery in vertebral BMD until 3 yr. Without the
hormone replacement therapy, the bone loss in the female
patients might have been greater. It is well known that gonadal
dysfunction in women occurs frequently after combined radi-
ation treatment and cytotoxic chemotherapy (21, 22). Since
hypogonadism is one of the main causes of post-BMT bone
loss, evaluation of estrogen and testosterone status after BMT
is needed and hormone replacement should follow when indi-
cated (23). Growth hormone deficiency should be evaluated
among long-term survivors. The decrease in bone formation
marker and increase in bone resorption marker, observed in
the immediate post-BMT period, might explain the initial
post-BMT bone loss.
In conclusion, although there was a decline in lumbar BMD
during the first year following BMT, gradual recovery occurred
until post-BMT 3 yr. Femoral BMD decreased much more
than lumbar BMD at 1 yr and did not recover until 3 yr. The
clear mechanism for this skeletal site-selective difference needs
to be elucidated through further studies. Evaluation of gonadal
function and measurement of BMD in long-term survivors
following BMT are recommended, especially in patients with
GVHD or TBI.
