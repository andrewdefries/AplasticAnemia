Abstract
The expression of the telomere-associated protein TIN2 has been shown to be essential for early embryonic development in
mice and for development of a variety of human malignancies. Recently, germ-line mutations in TINF2, which encodes for
the TIN2 protein, have been identified in a number of patients with bone-marrow failure syndromes. Yet, the molecular
mechanisms that regulate TINF2 expression are largely unknown. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in human TINF2
regulation, we cloned a 2.7 kb genomic DNA fragment containing the putative promoter region and, through deletion
analysis, identified a 406 bp region that functions as a minimal promoter. This promoter proximal region is predicted to
contain several putative Sp1 and NF-kB binding sites based on bioinformatic analysis. Direct binding of the Sp1 and NF-kB
transcription factors to the TIN2 promoter sequence was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and/
or chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Transfection of a plasmid carrying the Sp1 transcription factor into Sp-
deficient SL2 cells strongly activated TIN2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter expression. Similarly, the NF-kB molecules p50
and p65 were found to strongly activate luciferase expression in NF-kB knockout MEFs. Mutating the predicted transcription
factor binding sites effectively reduced TIN2 promoter activity. Various known chemical inhibitors of Sp1 and NF-kB could
also strongly inhibit TIN2 transcriptional activity. Collectively, our results demonstrate the important roles that Sp1 and NF-
kB play in regulating the expression of the human telomere-binding protein TIN2, which can shed important light on its
possible role in causing various forms of human diseases and cancers.

Introduction
Telomeres are complex nucleoprotein structures at chromo-
some ends that function to prevent chromosome fusions and
genomic instability (reviewed in [1]). Mammalian telomeres
consist of repetitive (T2AG3)n DNA sequence and associated
proteins that are collectively known as the shelterin complex. The
shelterin complex consists of at least six proteins TRF1, TRF2,
Rap1, TIN2, POT1, and TPP1 that are required for telomere
protection and length control (reviewed in [2]). The first of these
proteins, the telomere-repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1), was isolated
based on its ability to bind double-stranded TTAGGG repeats
[3,4], followed soon after by the identification of its paralog TRF2
[5,6]. TRF1-interacting nuclear protein 2 (TIN2) and Rap1 were
found through yeast two-hybrid screens for proteins that could
interact with TRF1 and TRF2, respectively [7,8]. Finally, a search
for TIN2-interacting proteins yielded TPP1 [9], and POT1 was
pulled out based on sequence homology to similar telomere-
protecting proteins in unicellular eukaryotes [10].
TIN2 is an important component of the shelterin complex as it
binds directly to the double-stranded telomeric DNA binding
proteins TRF1 and TRF2 and indirectly interacts with the single-
strand telomeric DNA binding protein POT1 via the intermediary
protein TPP1 [7,9]. Overexpression of TIN2 can shorten telomere
length in telomerase-positive human cells, similar to the effect of
overexpressing the TRF1 protein, implicating both proteins as a
negative regulators of telomere length [7]. In contrast, TIN2
depletion via shRNA disrupts TRF1 and TRF2 binding and
causes cell death, even in the absence of p53 function [11,12].
While TIN2 remains at telomeres in growth-arrested cells, it
appears to form large complexes outside the telomeres, implying
that TIN2 may play other important roles in mammary epithelial
differentiation [13], a hypothesis supported by the identification of
a novel isoform of TIN2 which can localize to the nuclear matrix
[14]. Furthermore, knock-out of TIN2 in a mouse model results in
early embryonic lethality prior to embryonic day 7.5 in a
telomerase-independent manner [15]. Such important roles of
TIN2 have prompted several laboratories to screen patients with
degenerative bone-marrow failure syndromes that are known to be
associated with telomere dysfunction for natural mutations in this
gene. These efforts have led to the identification of several natural
sequence variations in the TINF2 gene [16,17,18,19]. However,

the specific mechanisms through which these mutations may act to
affect disease pathology remain unknown.
In addition to the experimental alterations in TIN2 protein levels,
which clearly demonstrate that TIN2 level changes can disrupt
telomere end structure and result in cell distress and/or death,
several studies have shown that the changes in the endogenous
expression level of several telomere-binding proteins (including
TIN2) may be associated with various forms of human cancer
[20,21,22,23,24]. As over 90% of cancers have also been shown to
upregulate the catalytic component of the telomere-elongating
enzyme telomerase, more careful studies of the transcriptional
regulation of the telomere-binding proteins that have been directly
implicated in telomere maintenance are warranted. Furthermore, it
has recently been shown that the telomere-binding protein hRap1
and the transcription factor NF-kB positively regulate each other
through a feed-forward loop [25]. To this end, we have for the first
time characterized both the cis-elements and trans-acting factors that
regulate the transcription of the human TINF2 gene, which encodes
for the TIN2 protein. This comprehensive examination of the
transcriptional regulation of the TINF2 gene will shed important
light on the role(s) this gene plays in the pathogenesis of human
hematological diseases and cancer.
Results
Cloning and mapping the TINF2 promoter
To study promoter activation, the region located immediately
upstream of the initiation codon of the human TINF2 gene was
cloned from genomic DNA of HeLa cells by polymerase chain
reaction into the pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter vector. The
sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing, which was found to
completely match the corresponding TIN2 promoter proximal
sequence on chromosome 14 genomic contig (NT 026437)
reported by The Human Genome Project. A comparison of
luciferase activity in extracts prepared from 293T cells transfected
with the P2731 plasmid that contains the luciferase reporter gene
under the control of the longest sequence (,2.7 kb) of the TINF2
promoter proximal region with those transfected with the pGL3-
Control vector that contains the viral SV40 promoter-driven
luciferase gene showed that the TINF2 promoter functioned as a
reasonably strong promoter (Fig. 1A).
To better define the cis-acting sequences responsible for the
transcriptional activation of TINF2, a series of successive 59
deletions of TINF2 promoter sequence were generated based on
the available unique restriction enzyme sites on the P2731 vector
(Fig. 1A). These were again assayed for their ability to produce
luciferase reporter activity in a series of transient transfection
reactions of the individual plasmids into 293T cells. All constructs
that contain large regions of the TINF2 promoter sequence (i.e.
P2201, P1668, P553, and P450) produced levels of luciferase
activity that are comparable to those generated by the P2731
construct (Fig. 1A). In contrast, a significant drop in luciferase
activity (,3 fold, p,0.001) was observed with constructs
containing TINF2 promoter sequence of less than 351 base pairs
(i.e. P351, P248, and P148). Further deletion of the TINF2
promoter region (P74) resulted in a second significant drop in
reporter activity to the basal levels of luciferase activity generated
by the promoter-less pGL3-Basic construct (Fig. 1A). Collectively,
these results indicate that sequences responsible for TINF2
promoter regulation are contained within a core region encom-
passing 450 bps upstream of the translational initiation site of the
TINF2 gene.
Further successive deletion analysis of the P450 proximal
promoter construct generated two additional constructs (P389 and
P370) that produced similar levels of luciferase activity to P351
(Fig. 1B), strongly suggesting that elements responsible for activating
the TINF2 gene are primarily situated between positions 2406 and
2389, thus designating a minimal promoter of 406 base pairs. We
also created a series of 10 deletion constructs spanning the sequence
from position 2148 to 274 (Fig. 1C). When these deletion
constructs were transfected into 293T cells, robust luciferase
expression was observed with P148, as well as with all constructs
that contain longer than 88 bps of the TINF2 promoter sequence
(Fig. 1C, P148, P133, P118, P103, and P88). In contrast, all
constructs with less than 74 bps of promoter proximal sequence
(P74, P64, P54, P44, P34 and p24) showed levels of the luciferase
activity that were comparable to that of the negative control vector
pGL3-Basic (Fig. 1C, Vector). These observations suggest that there
is another important cis-acting element located between positions
288 and 274. Taken together, these promoter mapping experi-
ments revealed two major regions within the TINF2 promoter
proximal region located between positions 2(4062389) and
positions 2(88274) that contain essential transcriptional activating
elements of the TINF2 gene in 293T cells.
Prediction of putative regulatory elements within the
TINF2 promoter and validation of the cloned TINF2
promoter sequences in different cell lines
Sequence analysis revealed that the TINF2 promoter lacks the
conventional TATA and CAAT boxes as predicted for many of
the GC-rich promoters, such as that of the TINF2 gene. When
various bioinformatics methods (TESS, Genomatix, and Gene
Regulation search programs) were used, they all predicted a
number of potential transcription factor binding sites on the core
P450 TINF2 promoter sequence, including potential binding sites
for Sp1, AP-2, and NF-kB (data not shown). The abundance of
these sites suggests the possibility that TINF2 expression may be
subject to multiple levels of control and be regulated by different
factors in different cellular contexts. As such, we validated the
functionality of the core TINF2 promoter by transfecting the P450
construct into various cancer cell lines, including human leukemia
K562 cells and Jurkat cells (Fig. 1D). As shown in Fig. 1E, a few of
the putative transcription factor binding sites fall near the two
regions where we have observed significant drops in luciferase
reporter activity (Fig. 1B, 1C), allowing us to focus on these specific
sequence elements.
Binding of Sp1 to TINF2 promoter in vitro
To determine whether Sp1 can bind to its putative binding sites
in the TINF2 promoter, an electromobility shift assay (EMSA) was
performed using each putative site as a DNA probe and the
recombinant Sp1 protein that could be abundantly and correctly
translated in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (data not shown). A
specifically strong Sp1-shifted DNA band was observed with a DNA
oligo containing the putative Sp1-binding site spanning the GC-rich
motif at positions 2(88274) (Fig. 2A, lane 9). This Sp1-shifted band
could be super-shifted by the addition of an antibody against the
Sp1 protein (Fig. 2A, lane 12). Using a second DNA oligo
representing another potential Sp1-binding site at positions
2(4062389) and a similar amount of the in vitro translated Sp1
protein, a weak but consistent Sp1-shifted band was observed
(Fig. 2A, lane 3) that could also be super-shifted by the addition of
the anti-Sp1 antibody (Fig. 2A, lane 6), demonstrating that Sp1 can
bind with relatively high affinity to both of these sequences in vitro.
The specificity of the interactions was demonstrated by the
disappearance of the shifted bands when 100-fold molar excess of
unlabeled wild-type probe was added to the reactions as

competitors (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 10). In contrast, no competition
was observed when using unlabeled probes that contain 2-bp
substitutions of conserved core nucleotides mutations in these
putative Sp1-binding sequences (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 11). Further
Sp1-binding specificity was demonstrated by the failure to
generate a shifted complex with any of these DNA oligos with
the in vitro translated AP-2 protein or with the radiolabeled DNA
probes containing 2-bp substitution mutations in these two motifs
using similar gel shift conditions (data not shown). A strong band
located between the unbound oligos and the Sp1-shifted oligos (i.e.
the RRL binding band) was observed in most of the reactions,
even in a reaction when the pcDNA3.1 control vector (Fig. 2A, C-
Control) was used in the rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL),
suggesting that some endogenous transcription factors in the
RRL can also bind to the radiolabeled DNA probes. Collectively,
these data show that Sp1 can indeed specifically bind in vitro to two
DNA elements located within positions 2(4062389) and
2(88274) of the TINF2 promoter proximal region.
Binding of endogenous Sp1 proteins to the native TINF2
promoter in cells
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was next used to
determine whether endogenous Sp1 protein localizes to the native
TINF2 promoter. Sheared DNA from 293T cells was immuno-
precipitated using antibodies specific to the large subunit of Sp1, c-
Myc, or control IgG. TINF2 proximal promoter DNA was
detected by PCR using primers that amplify a 407 bp product.
Figure 2B shows that anti-Sp1 antibody could effectively and
specifically precipitate proteins bound to the TINF2 promoter
proximal region encompassing the minimal 406 base pair
promoter, which contains the two putative Sp1-binding sites
(Fig. 2B, lane 7), whereas anti-c-Myc antibody and non-specific
IgG antibody failed to precipitate any protein-DNA complexes
(Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5). These findings clearly demonstrate that
Sp1 indeed can bind to the TINF2 promoter proximal region in
293T cells.
Sp1 is a transcriptional activator of the TINF2 promoter
Sp1 and the related Sp3 are major factors of the Sp family of
transcription factors which can serve redundant roles in cells. They
are expressed in most mammalian cells except in the Drosophila
melanogaster SL2 cells, which allows for a convenient means to
determine whether Sp1 or Sp3 specifically activates the TINF2
promoter in cell culture. To do this, we co-transfected SL2 cells
with the minimal TINF2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter
construct P406 and either the Drosophila expression vector pPac-
Sp1 or pPac-Sp3. As shown in Figure 2C, upon addition of the
Sp1 transcription factor, we observed a very strong and dose-
dependent induction of luciferase reporter expression. In contrast,
while Sp3 appeared to also able to active TINF2 promoter-driven
luciferase activity, the effect was much weaker as compared to that
obtained with the Sp1 transcription factor. These data strongly
argue that Sp1, rather than Sp3, is the major transcriptional
activator of TINF2.
NF-kB binds to and transactivates the TINF2 promoter
Various bioinformatic methods predicted two potential NF-kB
binding sites residing near position 2(82278) (Fig. 1E). A
chromatin immunoprecipretation (ChIP) assay was carried out
using an antibody to the major p65 subunit of the NF-kB complex
and lysate prepared from the 293T cells as described in the
Materials and Methods section. We observed binding of
endogenous NF-kB to the native TINF2 promoter proximal
region in vivo (Fig. 3A, lane 5). In order to validate these findings,
we co-transfected the minimal TINF2 promoter-driven luciferase
reporter plasmid P406 with plasmids encoding the two major NF-
kB components p50 and p65, either individually or simultaneous-
ly, into NF- kB knockout NIH 3T3 (p502
/p652
) cells. Relative to
a control lysate of cells transfected with an empty expression
vector, luciferase activities were found to be minimally increased
when cells were transfected with either the p50 or p65 components
but were significantly increased when plasmids containing both
factors were co-transfected into cells (Fig. 3B). These data suggest
that, in addition to Sp1, NF-kB also serves an important role in
regulating TIN2 promoter activity.
Mutating the putative binding sites abolishes Sp1 and
NF-kB transcriptional activation of the TINF2 promoter
In order to determine whether the predicted Sp1 and NF-kB
binding sites are important for transcriptional activation of the
TINF2 promoter, core consensus nucleotides (see Materials and
Methods) were mutated in the P406 plasmid which contains the
minimal 406 bp promoter sequence. When transfected into
HEK293 cells, plasmids carrying single mutations in either Sp1
or NF-kB binding sites showed significantly decreased levels of
TINF2 promoter-driven luciferase activity relative to the P406
wild-type construct (Fig. 4). This reduction in promoter activation
is consistent with both our ChIP and EMSA data (Fig. 2A, 2B, and
3A) and supports the hypothesis that not only can Sp1 and NF-kB
bind to and transactivate the TINF2 promoter, but they do so by
binding to the specific sites predicted using bioinformatics
programs. However, as plasmids carrying double mutations in
both Sp1 or NF-kB binding sites do not show synergistic
reductions in luciferase activity (Fig. 4), the different putative
transcription factor binding sites may serve redundant roles or be
utilized under different cellular contexts.
Pharmacological inhibitors can interfere with Sp1- and
NF-kB-activated TINF2 transcription
Various pharmacological inhibitors exist which have been
shown to interfere with transcription factor binding and/or
activation of their target promoters. Mithramycin A, a GC-
specific DNA-binding drug [26] prevents binding of Sp1 to its
consensus GC-rich binding sites [27]. When added to 293T or
HEK293 cells transfected with the minimal promoter reporter
construct P406 or control plasmid constructs (pGL3-Basic,
pNFAT-Luc, or pGL3-Control), Mithramycin A was able to
specifically and significantly reduce the reporter activity of both
the TINF2 promoter and the SV40 promoter-containing pGL3-
Control plasmid, both of which contain Sp1 binding sites. No
effect was observed in chemically treated cells transfected with the
negative control vectors pGL3-Basic or pNFAT-Luc (Fig. 5A).
Similar results were obtained in Mithramycin A-treated HEK293
cells that were transfected with a similar set of plasmids (data not
shown). Bay11-7082 (Bay 11), which has been shown to

phosphorylation of IkB [28], also specifically and significantly
reduced NF-kB-mediated activation of the TINF2 promoter in a
strong dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). A similar effect was seen
with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC; Fig. 5C), an antioxidant
which also inhibits NF-kB by inhibiting IkB degradation [29].
None of the control vectors (pGL3-Basic, pGL3-Control, or
pNFAT-Luc) were impacted by these two NF-kB inhibitors.
Similar results were obtained in HEK293 cells transfected with a
similar set of plasmids and treated with Bay 11 or PDTC (data not
shown). Under similar drug treatment conditions, we found that
Mithramycin A and Bay11-7082 also reduced endogenous TINF2
gene expression levels as compared to those in either untreated
cells or cells treated with the vehicle control DMSO (Fig. 5D).
Collectively, these studies provide further evidence that Sp1 and
NF-kB indeed play important roles in regulating the transcrip-
tional activation of the TINF2 gene.
Discussion
Both Sp1 and NF-kB have been shown to be misregulated in
the disease state, including various types of human cancer. For
example, Sp1 mRNA and DNA-binding activities are increased in
epithelial tumors, suggesting that increased activity of this
transcription factor contributes to tumor progression in the skin
[30], and Sp1 has been shown to be constitutively overexpressed in
pancreatic and gastric cancers [31,32]. Also, Sp1 site-dependent
transcription is involved in many signal transduction pathways
linked to cancer progression (reviewed in [33]). Constitutive IKK
and NF-kB signaling have been implicated in the development of
several cancers as well, particularly breast cancer [34,35,36,37]. As
maintaining telomeres in order to escape cellular senescence is an
important aspect of cancer development and progression, it is
possible that alterations in the expression levels and/or activation
of these transcription factors could be an early step in a signaling
pathway designed to hijack the cellular machinery in order to
create the optimal environment for cancer cell growth.
In this study, we have explored the mechanisms that regulate
TINF2 transcription and identified a core promoter region of
approximately 406 base pairs, which appears to be at least
partially regulated by the Sp1 and NF-kB transcription factors.
Our research is in keeping with the finding that Sp1 interacts with
components of the transcription machinery to help initiate the
transcription of TATA-less promoters, such as the TINF2
promoter [38,39,40]. Furthermore, Sp1 has been implicated in
the transcriptional regulation of both core components of human
telomerase, hTERT and hTR [41,42,43]. Of particular interest is
the identification of a functional mutation in a putative Sp1
binding site in the hTR promoter in a patient with paroxysmal
nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare blood disorder [43]. As it
has been hypothesized that telomere dysregulation is involved in
the pathogenesis of several human diseases, including bone-
marrow failure disorders (reviewed in [44]) and cancer (reviewed
in [45]), future research should be directed toward careful
screening of the promoter proximal regions of genes important

for telomere maintenance in order to identify any functional
sequence changes. In addition, as Sp1 binding sites are GC-rich,
there is a strong probability that the transcriptional regulation of
these proteins may be subject to epigenetic regulation as well.
Therefore, characterization of the methylation status of the
endogenous TIN2 promoter may also be warranted.
Teo and colleagues have recently uncovered an unexpected
relationship between NF-kB and the shelterin component, hRap1
[25]. They have shown that not only can NF-kB activate
transcription of the hRap1 promoter, but hRap1 itself can
positively regulate NF-kB activation through its interaction with
IKK. The NF-kB pathway has also been found to be involved in
the upregulation of hTERT in HTLV-I-transformed cells [46], as
the viral Tax protein can activate NF-kB which in turn stimulates
Sp1-dependent transcription [47,48], a process already known to
be important for hTERT regulation. Taking all these data
together, it is reasonable to speculate a global regulation
mechanism for proteins important for telomere maintenance;
however, a detailed exploration of the promoter regions of genes
that encode all known components of the telomere binding and
maintenance complexes is still necessary.
Materials and Methods
Cloning of the TINF2 functional promoter region
Using the available genomic sequence of the TINF2 gene in the
GenBank database (NT 026437), we designed an appropriate
primer set (sequences available upon request) to amplify a 2.7 kb
DNA fragment corresponding to a region immediately upstream
of the known initiation codon of the gene by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). The PCR reaction was performed using the
following reaction conditions: 200 ng of genomic DNA isolated
from HeLa cells using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen), 1U of
Phusion Hot-Start DNA Polymerase (FINNZYMES, 2 U/ml),
16Phusion GC buffer, 0.5 mM primers, 200 mM dNTPs, and 3%
v/v DMSO per 50 ml reaction volume. The PCR cycling program
was the following: 98uC for 30 sec; 35 cycles of 98uC for 10 sec,
72uC for 90 sec; 72uC for 10 min.
Generation of luciferase reporter constructs
The 2.7 kb PCR product was digested with HindIII and NcoI
(New England Biolabs, NEB), gel-purified (Qiagen), and cloned
into the same restriction enzyme sites of the pGL3-Basic vector
(Promega) to allow transcription of the firefly luciferase reporter
gene under control of this DNA fragment. To generate a series of
deletion constructs (Fig. 1A), the plasmid P2731 that contained the
2.7 kb TINF2 promoter sequence was digested with HindIII and
either AflII, PvuII, AleI, BIpI, or AvrII, end-polished by the Mung
bean nuclease and then self-ligated with T4 DNA Ligase to
generate the plasmid constructs P2201, P1668, P553, P450, P351,
P248, P148, and P74. All enzymes were purchased from NEB. All
other truncation plasmids (Fig. 1B and 1C) were obtained by PCR
mutagenesis using the QuickChange method (Stratagene) and
appropriate primer sets (sequences available upon request). All
plasmid DNAs were confirmed to have the intended sequences by
direct sequencing, and their quantity and quality routinely
checked by spectrophotometric analysis and agarose gel electro-
phoresis.
Luciferase assays in mammalian cells
293T cells were seeded at a density of 46105
cells per well (or
HEK293 cells at a density of 26105
cells per well) in 12-well plates
24 hours prior to transfection. The cells were transfected with
700 ng of the TINF2 promoter-driven luciferase plasmid(s) and
100 ng of either the pRSV-b-galactosidase plasmid or the pRL-
CMV plasmid as an internal control of transfection efficiency,
using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) for
293T cells and SuperFect (Qiagen) for HEK293 cells according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were harvested 24 hours
after transfection and lysed in 200 ml reporter lysis buffer
(Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase
Assay System (Promega), and b-galactosidase activity was
determined by Beta-Glo Assay System (Promega). Luciferase
activity (arbitrary units) was divided by the internal control in the
same sample to normalize for transfection efficiency and expressed
as relative luciferase activity. Transfection data represents at least
three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. The
wild-type P450 plasmid construct was also transfected into the
Jurkat and K562 human leukemic cells lines using similar
conditions as outlined above for 293T cells.
NIH 3T3 p65/p50 double-knockout cells (a kind gift of Dr.
David Baltimore at the California Institute of Technology) were
maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Minimal Essential Medium
(DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2 at 37uC.
These cells were seeded at a density of 56104
cells per well in 12-
well plates 24 hours prior to being transfected with 500 ng of the
appropriate TINF2 promoter-driven luciferase plasmids, 500 ng of
either pCMV4-p50 or pCMV4-p65, or 500 ng of pCMV4 empty
vector using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Luciferase
activities were normalized to the total amount of cellular protein as
determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay.
Luciferase assay in Drosophila melanogaster SL2 cells
Drosophila melanogaster Schneider SL2 cells, known to lack
expression of the Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors, were cultured in
HyClone SFX-Insect serum-free medium (HyClone). On the day
of transfection, cells were collected, washed once with 1X PBS,
and seeded at a density of 16106
cells/ml in 6-well plates. Cells
were then transfected using SuperFect transfection reagent
(Qiagen) with 1 mg of the appropriate TINF2 promoter-driven
luciferase reporter plasmid(s) along with varying amounts of pPac-
Sp1 plasmid (a kind gift of Dr. Robert Tjian, University of
California, Berkeley) or pPac-Sp3 plasmid (a generous gift of Dr.
G. Suske, University of Marburg, Germany), and the total amount
of DNA brought up to 2 mg per well with the empty pPac plasmid.
Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested in
Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega) and assayed for luciferase activity
as suggested by the manufacturer (Promega). Luciferase activities
Figure 5. Pharmacological inhibitors can interfere with Sp1- and NF-kB-mediated TINF2 promoter activation. A: Mithramycin A, an Sp1
inhibitor, reduces TINF2 promoter-driven luciferase activity. 293T cells are transfected with either the promoter-less pGL3-Basic plasmid, the NFAT-
responsive pNFAT-Luc plasmid, the SV40 promoter-containing pGL3-Control plasmid, or the minimal TIN2 promoter P406 plasmid and incubated
with the indicated concentrations of drug for 24 hours. For each transfection, the firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity
expressed from a co-transfected Renilla luciferase expression vector. The means from three independent experiments are shown; bars, SD. (**p,0.01,
***p,0.001). B: Bay11-7082, an NF-kB inhibitor, reduces TINF2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter activity. Cells are processed and values expressed
as in panel A. (***p,0.001). C: PDTC, an NF-kB inhibitor, reduces TINF2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter activity. Cells are processed and values
expressed as in panel A. (***p,0.001). D. Mithramycin A and Bay11-7082 (Bay11) reduce endogenous TINF2 gene expression. The levels of TINF2
mRNA were normalized to those of the housekeeping GAPDH gene. The means from three independent experiments are shown.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Human Sp1 and AP2 proteins were in vitro synthesized by the
TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System
(Promega) using pcDNA3.1-Sp1 and pcDNA3.1-AP2 (kind gifts of
Dr. Ceshi Chen at Emory University) as templates, respectively.
Double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides representing the transcrip-
tional binding sites were prepared by denaturing complementary
single-stranded oligonucleotides (synthesized by Invitrogen) at 90uC
for 10 min and then cooling to room temperature gradually before
end-labeling with [c-32
P]dATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB).
Oligo sequences are as follows:
412-382 WT: CTACAGCTCCGCTGGGGCGTGGCCTTC-
TGACG
412-382 Mut: CTACAGCTCCGCTGGAACGTGGCCTT-
CTGACG
95-59 WT: GTTGCCAGAAGCCCCGCCCCTAGGAGT-

In vitro translated protein was incubated in 10 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), 4% glycerol, 1 mM MgCl2, 25 mM KCl, 0.5 mM
dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mg/
ml poly(dI-dC) in a final volume of 20 ml for 10 min at room
temperature. The incubation was continued for an additional
30 min at room temperature after the addition of 50,000 cpm 32
P
-labeled probes. For competition experiments, 100-fold molar
excess of unlabeled DNA oligonucleotides were added to the
binding reaction mixture 10 minutes prior to the addition of the
labeled probes. For super-shift experiments, 2 mg of antibody
against Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotech) were incubated with the binding
reaction mixture on ice for 1 hour before the labeled probe was
added. The DNA–protein complexes were separated by electro-
phoresis on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5X TBE at 200 V
for 2 hours at 4uC, vacuum-dried, and then autoradiographed.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
293T cells in 100 mm cell culture plates (cell number at
,2.56107
) were cross-linked for 10 min by adding formaldehyde
directly into tissue culture medium (final concentration of 1%) at
room temperature with mild shaking. The reaction was stopped by
adding glycine (125 mM), and the cells were kept at room
temperature for 5 minutes. The cross-linked cells were then
washed twice with cold PBS, scraped, pelleted, and resuspended in
600 ml of Nuclei Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mM
EDTA, 1% SDS) with protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 10 mg/
ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mg/ml aprotinin) (Sigma).
The lysates were then sonicated for four cycles of 10 sec each,
resting on ice for 2 min between cycles, on a Branson Sonifier 450
(settings: duty cycle = 50%; output control = 3), resulting in
chromatin fragmentation to an average length of 500–1000 bps.
After sonication, the samples were then centrifuged at 16,000 g for
10 minutes. Sheared chromatin was diluted 20-fold in ChIP
dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA,
16.7 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 167 mM NaCl) with protease
inhibitors as described above. Then, 4 mg of Rabbit anti-Sp1
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, PEP 2), Rabbit anti-p65 antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotech, C-20), control antibody (Rabbit anti-c-Myc,
Santa Cruz Biotech, A14), or no antibody was added to each
aliquot of chromatin extract and the reaction mixture incubated
overnight at 4uC on a rotary shaker. Complexes were captured by
incubation with protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech)
blocked with 250 mg/ml of sheared salmon sperm DNA (Ambion)
and 1 mg/ml BSA (NEB) in ChIP dilution buffer at 4uC for
4 hours. Captured complexes were washed successively with ChIP
dilution buffer, high-salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-
100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mM NaCl),
LiCl wash buffer (0.5 M LiCl, 1% NP40, 1% deoxycholate,
100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Complexes were washed twice in each
buffer for 10 min apiece with shaking and then centrifuged to
collect protein A/G agarose beads. After the final wash, 250 ml of
elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO3) was added and
incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes with rotation.
Then, 5 M NaCl was added to reverse the formaldehyde cross-
linking by heating at 65uC for 4 hours. After precipitation with
ethanol, the pellets were resuspended and treated with proteinase
K (NEB). DNA was recovered by standard phenol–chloroform
extraction and ethanol precipitation. Pellets were resuspended in
TE buffer and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification using the following primers to amplify the TIN2
fragment: Forward (59-CTTCTGACGCACCGTCACGG-39)
and Reverse (59-CACCAGGGGCGTAGCCATGG-39). The
PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Generation of luciferase reporter plasmids carrying point
mutations
Transcriptional binding site mutant plasmids (Fig. 4A and 4B)
were generated in the minimal promoter pGL3-P406 backbone by
PCR mutagenesis using the QuickChange method (Stratagene)
and appropriate primer sets (sequences available upon request).
Sequences of the putative binding site mutants are as follows:
P406 (3972396) WT: GCTGGGGCGTGG;
P406 (3972396) Mut: GCTGGAACGTGG;
P406 (79278) WT: CCCCGCCCCTAG;
P406 (79278) Mut: CCCCGTTCCTAG;
P406 (99296) WT: CGACAGGGAGTTGC;
P406 (99296) Mut: CGACAAAATGTTGC;
P406 (64260) WT: TGATCGGAAAGCCTC;
P406 (64260) Mut: TGATCAACCCGCCTC. Numbers in
parentheses denote mutated nucleotides, which are underlined. All
mutated DNAs were confirmed by direct sequencing, and their
quantity and quality routinely checked by spectrophotometric
analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis.
Pharmacological inhibitors
293T or HEK293 cells were seeded at a density of 26105
cells
per well in 12 well plates 24 hours prior to transfection. Bay11-
7082 (Sigma) at 100 nM or 10 mM concentration, PDTC (Sigma)
at 500 nM or 5 mM, or Mithramycin A (Sigma) at 1 nM or
100 nM was added directly to the media 1 hour prior to being
transfected with 1 mg of either the minimal promoter construct
(pGL3-P406), pGL3-Basic, pNFAT-Luc, or pGL3-Control along
with 70 ng of pRL-CMV using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
for the 293T cells and SuperFect (Qiagen) for the HEK293 cells
according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Media was changed
4 hours post-transfection to a fresh aliquot of the media that
contain the same amounts of the chemicals as shown above.
24 hours later, cell lysates were prepared for luciferase activity
measurements using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega). Firefly luciferase reporter readings were normalized to
the co-transfected Renilla luciferase values and expressed as relative
luciferase activity. All reactions were done in triplicate.
HEK293 cells were seeded at a density of 56105
cells per well in
a 6-well format. Bay11-7082 (Sigma) at 10 mM concentration or
Mithramycin A (Sigma) at 100 nM was added directly to the

media. As controls, cells were either treated with DMSO at 10 mM
concentration used to dissolve the compounds or left untreated.
Twenty-four hours later, total RNA was extracted from cells using
Bee reagent (Tel. Test Inc.) and quantified. Fifty micrograms of
each of samples was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen)
for 30 minutes at 37uC followed by its inactivation at 85uC for 20
minutes. Thirty micrograms of each sample was used for reverse
transcription using the Superscript III reverse transcriptase as
described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Oligo dT and
GAPDH primers (sequences available upon request) were used
in the reverse transcription reaction at 50uC for 1 hr. The
quantitative real-time PCR was carried out in a 20 ul reaction
mixture containing primers specific for the TINF2 gene (Fd: 59-
GGAGTTTCTGCGATCTCTGC-39, Rv: 59 GTTTCC-
TGTGCCTCCAAAATC-39) or for the GAPDH RNA (Fd: 59-
GAAGGT GAAGGTCGGAGTC-39 and Rv: 59-GAAGAT-
GGTGATGGGATTTC-39) by using Sybr green DNA dye
(Invitrogen) in the reaction mixture. The PCR conditions were
50uC for 2 min, 95uC for 2 min, and 45 cycles of 95uC for 15 s,
55uC for 30 s, and 72uC for 30 s. The TINF2 RNA levels,
expressed as threshold cycle (cT) values, were normalized to the
GAPDH RNA levels.
