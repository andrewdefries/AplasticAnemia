Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of enhanced, intensive, immuno-suppressive therapy with umbilical cord blood
support for severe aplastic anemia (SAA).
Methods: A total of 25 patients with SAA received enhanced, intensive, immuno-suppressive therapy and a
cord blood transfusion. Therapy protocol: Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) 2.5 mg/(kg•d) × 5d; Cyclophosphamide
50 mg/(kg•d) × 2d; cyclosporin A (CsA) maintenance therapy.
Result: 25 patients were enrolled. 18 underwent a complete recovery, 4 made significant improvements, 1 did
not respond, and 2 died. Therefore, the efficacy rate was 88%. The median follow-up time was 35 months (range
13-47 months), and the 3-year overall survival rate was 92%. Patients rapidly achieved reconstitution of
hematopoiesis. The median time to neutrophil ANC > 0.5 × 109
/L was 18 days (range 8-36), platelets >20 × 109
/L
was 34 days (range 12-123), and Hb > 100 g/L 95 dyas (range 35-173).
Conclusion: Enhanced, intensive, immuno-suppressive therapy with umbilical cord blood support may be an
effective option for SAA therapy.
To the Editor:
Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) has a high mortality rate
[1]. High-dose cyclophosphamide (CTX) treatment for
SAA provides some benefit; however, the recovery of
hematopoiesis is slow, and some studies have demon-
strated high treatment-related mortality rates. Therefore,
the toxic side effects of high-dose CTX (e.g., hemorrha-
gic cystitis) cannot be ignored. Intensive immunosup-
pressive therapy, such as combined anti-thymocyte
globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CSA), has an average
onset of efficacy of 3-7 months and an efficacy rate of
60-80%. Before the onset of efficacy, patients are suscep-
tible to severe infection. Moreover, infection shortly
after treatment is a major cause of death in these
patients and requires large number of blood transfu-
sions[2,3]. In 1974, Knudtzon et al[4]. first discovered
hematopoietic progenitor cells in umbilical cord blood.
After cord blood transfusion, early hematopoietic pro-
genitor cells from umbilical cord blood can survive, pro-
liferate, and differentiate in a patient’s body for a short
time. During this time, they can secrete hematopoietic
stimulating factors and contribute to hematopoietic
replacement, which both shortens the duration of and
helps patients to overcome agranulocytosis[5]. There is
a reduced requirement for transfusion of blood products
and an increase in the total efficacy rate for this
treatment.
In this study, 25 patients with severe aplastic anemia
were treated with intensive immunosuppressive therapy
combined with supportive therapy of umbilical cord
blood transfusion. All patients were treated in our
department between January 2006 and January 2009.
Patients were confirmed to have SAA by hemogram
analysis and bone marrow biopsies. In total, 25 patients
between the ages of 3 and 28 were included (median

age: 11 years old). Of these patients, 12 were male and
13 were female, and there were 12 patients >12 yrs, and
13 <= 12 yrs. The patients were treated with intensive
immunosuppressive agents combined with an umbilical
cord blood transfusion.
Treatment regimen
ATG 2.5-3.0 mg/(kg·d) × 5d and cyclophosphamide
CTX 50 mg/(kg·d) × 2d + cyclosporine A were com-
bined with an unrelated umbilical cord blood transfu-
sion. The mononuclear cell (MNC) count of the
transfused cord blood was 2.25-15.1 × 107
cells/kg with
a median MNC count of 4.0 × 107
cells/kg. Two
patients weighing over 80 kg were given double units of
the umbilical cord blood transfusion. HLA matching
and blood typing were performed for umbilical cord
blood selection, and cord blood units with 1-3 HLA typ-
ing mismatches were selected. G-CSF (5 μg/kg·d) was
given until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was >
1.5 × 109
cells/L. To enhance platelets recovery, all
patients received 1.5 mg/day of IL-11.
Results
Of the 25 patients, 18 underwent a complete recovery, 4
made significant improvements, 1 did not respond, and
2 died. Therefore, the efficacy rate was 88%. The median
follow-up time was 35 months (range 13-47 months),
and the 3-year overall survival rate was 92%.
Patients rapidly achieved reconstitution of hemato-
poiesis. The median time to neutrophil ANC > 0.5 ×
109
/L was 18 days (range 8-36), platelets >20 × 109
/L
was 34 days (range 12-123), and Hb > 100 g/L 95 days
(range 35-173). Although the body weights between
age groups (< = 12 yrs vs >12 ) differ significantly, the
hematopoiesis recovery time did not significantly differ
between the two groups (Table 1) (P > 0.05 using a t-
test). There was no durable donor engraftment nor
GVHD. Therefore the umbilical cord blood transfusion
provided transient hematopoietic support and reduced
transfusion requirement. Further expanded study is
needed to characterize the kinetics of hematopoietic
reconstitution.
