Adult BM is composed of hematopoietic stem
cells (HSCs) and tissue stem cells, which are
often referred to as fibroblast CFUs (CFU-Fs),
marrow stromal cells/mesenchymal stem cells
(MSCs), or mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs;
Friedenstein et al., 1974; Prockop, 1997; Conget
and Minguell, 1999; Pittenger et al., 1999). As
information is gathered about MSCs, parallels
are often drawn between them and the exten-
sively characterized HSCs. HSCs were initially
identified by Till and McCulloch (1961), who
called them spleen CFUs (CFU-Ss), and MSCs
were first described by Friedenstein et al. (1974),
who called them CFU-Fs. There has since been
a major divergence in the way the two stem cell
types are studied.
HSCs can be identified prospectively by sur-
face markers, isolated by flow cytometry, and
transplanted in vivo without being cultured
in vitro (Smith et al., 1991; Spangrude et al., 1995;
Osawa et al., 1996; Matsuzaki et al., 2004). In
contrast, MSCs, which can give rise to multiple
mesenchymal cell lineages, including adipo-
cytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes (Prockop,
1997; Pittenger et al., 1999), are currently iso-
lated by culturing tissues from humans and
other species (da Silva Meirelles et al., 2006;
Beltrami et al., 2007). Therefore, most infor-
mation about MSCs comes from in vitro stud-
ies (Pittenger et al., 1999) of heterogeneous
populations of adherent cells that contain un-
identified, putative stem cells. This is a critical
difference because it is the ability to isolate
HSCs prospectively that has facilitated the rapid

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are defined as cells that undergo sustained in vitro growth
and can give rise to multiple mesenchymal lineages. Because MSCs have only been isolated
from tissue in culture, the equivalent cells have not been identified in vivo and little is
known about their physiological roles or even their exact tissue location. In this study, we
used phenotypic, morphological, and functional criteria to identify and prospectively isolate
a subset of MSCs (PDGFR+Sca-1+CD45TER119) from adult mouse bone marrow. Indi-
vidual MSCs generated colonies at a high frequency and could differentiate into hemato-
poietic niche cells, osteoblasts, and adipocytes after in vivo transplantation. Naive MSCs
resided in the perivascular region in a quiescent state. This study provides the useful
method needed to identify MSCs as defined in vivo entities.

progress in understanding their biology. In contrast, because
our knowledge of MSCs is based solely on the characteriza-
tion of cultured cells, it has been virtually impossible to study
many of their properties, particularly their function, in vivo.
Recent studies consistently show that MSCs not only
differentiate into mesenchymal lineage cells but also into
neurons (Kohyama et al., 2001; Kondo et al., 2005), skeletal
muscle (Dezawa et al., 2005), and myocardium (Makino et al.,
1999; Miyahara et al., 2006). Therefore, MSCs are now con-
sidered a potentially effective source for stem cell therapy (Jin
et al., 2002; Hoffmann et al., 2006). However, safety issues
still need to be clarified before their clinical use, particularly
because so many biological aspects of MSCs, such as their
exact identity and in vivo function, are still unknown.
One disadvantage of the conventional in vitro method for
isolating MSCs is the unavoidable contamination by hemato-
poietic cells and the cellular heterogeneity of the cultures,
including various fibroblastic cells. In fact, depending on the
study, cultured MSCs express a different subset of various cell
lineage–specific antigens, adhesion molecules, integrins, and
growth factor receptors (Jiang et al., 2002; da Silva Meirelles
et al., 2006). Another problem with the current technique is
that the cultured cells may acquire different characteristics
from their in vivo state, which could include changes in the
cell surface markers they express. One example of adherent
culture-induced change is seen when MSCs, which are read-
ily expanded in culture without loss of multipotency, show
poor tissue tropism when transplanted, including a failure to
migrate to the BM (Rombouts and Ploemacher, 2003; Wang
et al., 2005; Muguruma et al., 2006; Sackstein et al., 2008),
which limits their therapeutic usefulness. In contrast, some
studies (including the current one) show that primary BM-
derived MSCs (assayed as CFU-Fs) show a low but efficient
seeding of the BM upon injection into lethally irradiated
hosts (Rombouts and Ploemacher, 2003; Koide et al., 2007).
Because these changes affect fundamental properties of the
cells, it is difficult to know whether they have retained or lost
their original characteristics, including their apparent multi-
potency, in vitro.
Most studies on MSCs have been done using human
cells, not murine cells. Murine MSCs (mMSCs) are far more
difficult to isolate from the BM and to expand in culture
than human MSCs (Phinney et al., 1999; Sun et al., 2003;
Peister et al., 2004). Thus, there is much less information on
mMSCs than on human MSCs. This reliance on human
material means that MSCs cannot be studied in genetic
mouse models, which greatly hinders the study of their basic
biology, engraftment, and therapeutic potential. In fact, with-
out some means for the prospective isolation and purifica-
tion of MSCs, it becomes extremely difficult to ascribe any
attribute to them with certainty. Hence, there is a clear need
for specific markers and methods of detection, enumeration,
and isolation of MSCs from the BM and other tissues where
they reside.
In a previous study, we identified several mesenchymal
lineage specific markers in murine BM cells (Koide et al.,
2007), and after initial screening, we determined two possible
MSC markers (Morikawa et al., 2009), platelet-derived growth
factor receptor  (PDGFR; an early mesodermal marker;
Takakura et al., 1997) and stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1; a known
stem cell marker; Ortega et al., 1986).
Here, we report a method for identifying and isolating
MSCs from the adult murine BM, using flow cytometry in
combination with in vitro function assays. We also report our
findings on their physiological role, obtained through exist-
ing in vivo precursor cell transplantation assays. We describe
cell type–specific markers for MSCs, which are useful for
their prospective isolation as a highly enriched population
that gives rise to mesenchymal cells at the clonal level with
high frequency, and demonstrate that these cells are capable
of in vivo grafting when transplanted systemically.
RESULTS
The PS population is significantly enriched for CFU-Fs
with differentiation potential
Freshly prepared BM cells were stained with antibodies to
PDGFR, Sca-1, CD45, and TER119, and analyzed by flow
cytometry. First, the hematopoietic (CD45+ and TER119+)
cells were removed from the population by gating on the
marker signals (Fig. 1, A and C). In the CD45TER119
gate, four distinct subpopulations (PDGFR+/Sca-1+, +/,
/+, /) were observed (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, the fre-
quency of cells expressing PDGFR or Sca-1 significantly
increased when the BM was extracted using collagenase treat-
ment (Fig. 1, B and D; see Materials and methods).
To test whether PDGFR or Sca-1 could be used for
the prospective isolation of mMSCs, we isolated cells in
each subpopulation from freshly isolated BM mononuclear
2486 DIRECT ISOLATION METHOD FOR PDGFR+ SCA-1+ mMSCS | Morikawa et al.
A single, self-renewing PS cell can give rise
to mesenchymal and endothelial lineages
To test the hypothesis that PS cells contained MSCs that
could differentiate into all three lineages, and to rule out the
possibility that the PS population contained several different
kinds of committed progenitors, we performed a differentia-
tion assay with expanded cell colonies derived from a single
PS cell. For this experiment, sorted PS cells were plated at
a density of 1-2 × 103 cells on a 100-mm dish. 60 individ-
ual colonies of 50–100 cells were isolated 14 d after plating
(Fig. 2 A). After several passages, 6 of the 60 independent
clones were selected for further study and subjected to in vitro
differentiation assays.
All six clones showed osteogenic and chondrogenic differ-
entiation, assessed by alkaline phosphatase/toluidine blue stain-
ing and the expression of bone and cartilage-related genes,
including osteopontin, osteocalcin, PTHr, collagen II, collagen X,
and aggrecan. Four (clones 7, 11, 17, and 19) also underwent
adipogenic differentiation, demonstrated by oil red O staining
and the expression of fat-related genes, including adipsin,
PPAR, and mLP (Fig. 2, B and C). Interestingly, these four
clones also underwent angiogenic differentiation, as shown by
staining for endothelium-associated proteins (PECAM-1 and
VE-cadherin). These results suggest that MSCs are precursors
for both mesenchymal and endothelial lineages.
Flow cytometric analysis of clones from single cells re-
vealed uniform expression of conventional mesenchymal
markers CD29, CD49e, CD44, and Sca-1, but only hetero-
geneous expression of CD105 and CD90, which are known
as marker for cultured human MSCs. Clones with multi-
lineage differentiation potential (#7, 11, 17, and 19) were
CD105+CD90+, unlike those with limited differentiation
potential (#26, 42). This observation suggests that CD105
and CD90 may be useful indicators for multipotency of cul-
tured mMSCs (Fig. S2).
PS cells reside in the perivascular space in vivo
The data presented so far convinced us that the PS popula-
tion represented primary mMSCs. Therefore, we further in-
vestigated the in vivo localization and cell-surface phenotype
of naive PS cells by whole-mount immunohistochemistry
(whole-mount IHC) and flow cytometry. As far as we ob-
served in >100 microscopic fields of three individual wild-
type C57BL/6, all PS cells were located in the arterial
perivascular space near the inner surface of the cortical bone
(Fig. 3 A), adjacent to vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs)
in BM (Fig. 3 B). PDGFR was expressed in a broader cell
population that included cells with reticular morphology,
and relatively weak Sca-1 expression was detected in the en-
dothelial cells (Fig. 3 B).
Because reticular cells located in the perivascular space act
as hematopoietic niche cells (Sugiyama et al., 2006), we used
quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3 C) and IHC (Fig. 3 D) to exam-
ine the expression of two major paracrine factors that main-
tain hematopoiesis: angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1; Arai et al., 2004)
and CXCL12 (Sugiyama et al., 2006). We found abundant
cells (BMMNCs) and performed several in vitro assays to
determine their characteristics. A traditional CFU-F assay
showed that the number of colonies per 1,000 cells was
highest in the PDGFR+Sca-1+CD45TER119 (PS)
subpopulation; however, the cells in the other subpopula-
tions still produced a significant number of colonies (Fig. 1 E).
Conventional MSC culture conditions (Phinney et al., 1999;
Pittenger et al., 1999) yielding fibroblastic/spindle-shaped
cells indicative of MSCs were only derived in the PS
cultures on day 14 (Fig. 1 F, top right). The other subpopu-
lations showed different morphologies, such as the cobble­
stone appearance typical of endothelial cells, observed in the
PDGFRSca-1+ group (Fig. 1 F). In addition, an analysis
of growth kinetics revealed that only the PS cells prolifer-
ated without senescence, yielding more than 107 cells from
the original 5,000 cells seeded, with a doubling time of
50.6 h (Fig. 1 G).
We also observed a negative linear relationship between
seeding density and colony formation efficiency (Fig. 1 H;
Stingl et al., 2006). In unfractionated BMMNCs, isolated
without collagenase treatment, the frequency of CFU-Fs was
1/2.6 × 106 cells, as described previously (Phinney et al.,
1999). It was 100 times greater when collagenase treatment
was used (1/3.6 × 104). The frequency of CFU-Fs obtained
from PS cells was 1 per 22.5 cells, which was consistent
with the bulk CFU-F assays (Fig. 1 E). Collectively, the PS
cells showed a 120,000-fold higher CFU-F frequency than
the unfractionated BMMNCs.
The PS cells’ potential for in vitro mesenchymal lin-
eage differentiation was also investigated (Fig. 1 I). Freshly
prepared BM cells were separated into the four CD45
TER119 subpopulations described above, cultured with
maintenance media for one or two passages, and then
grown in differentiation-induction media for an additional
14–21 d. Only the PS cells differentiated robustly into adi-
pocytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes. Although other
fractions formed a pelletable micro-mass when grown un-
der chondrogenic conditions, the extracellular matrix was
either scarce or absent, as tested by toluidine blue staining.
Adipocytes were generated almost solely by the PS popu-
lation, although a very few were occasionally seen in the
PDGFR+Sca-1 population. PS cells were also detected
in the BM of other mouse strains, and showed both high
colony-forming frequency and trilineage differentiation
potential at levels comparable to the C57BL/6 PS cells
(Fig. S1).
As might be expected for MSCs, the PS cells did not
have any hematopoietic capacity in vitro. They did not con-
tain any CFUs under hematopoietic culture conditions,
whereas sorted HSCs (CD34KSL cells) formed over 80 col-
onies per 100 cells under the same conditions (Fig. 1, J and K).
Notably, flow cytometric analysis showed that the PS BM
fraction did not contain any side population (SP) cells, a pop-
ulation enriched for stem cells, including HSCs, derived from
a variety of tissues (Fig. 1 L; Goodell et al., 1996; Ono et al.,
2007; Oyama et al., 2007).

for cultured human MSCs (CD29, CD49e, CD105, CD133,
and PDGFR). Endothelial cell markers (Flk-1, VEGFR3,
and CD146, except for CD34) were also uniformly expressed,
although the fluorescence intensities were lower than that of
the markers for cultured human MSCs. Markers for HSCs
(c-kit and CD150) were totally negative. The cells showed
expression of Ang-1 in the PS cells and of CXCL12 in the
PDGFR+Sca-1 cells, suggesting that the MSCs constitute
a hematopoietic niche in the arterial perivascular area near
the endosteum (Moore and Lemischka, 2006).

revealed that PS cells uniformly expressed known markers

PS cells repopulate hematopoietic niche components
and adipose tissue in vivo
Although the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells has
not been believed to be feasible (Wang et al., 2005; Sackstein
et al., 2008), we and several other groups have reported that
freshly isolated BM cells can replace a part of mesenchymal or
stromal cells (Hou et al., 1999; Pereira et al., 1998; Rombouts
and Ploemacher, 2003; Koide et al., 2007). To examine whether
naive MSCs can reconstitute the BM in vivo, freshly isolated
104 PS cells from CAG-EGFP transgenic mice (EGFP+
CD45.1) were intravenously injected into lethally irradiated
recipient mice (EGFP CD45.1) along with 100 CD34KSL
cells (HSCs sorted from EGFP CD45.1+ mice; Fig. 4). The
cells derived from PS or HSCs were traceable by their ex-
pression of EGFP or CD45.1, respectively.
At 16 wk, the peripheral blood of 10 out of 10 recipients
had been reconstituted by HSC-derived CD45.1-positive
cells averaging 81.1 ± 4.9% of the total cells counted (unpub-
lished data). The recipient animals were subsequently sacri-
ficed and BM sections were subjected to whole-mount IHC.
We found a significant number of PS-derived GFP+ cells in
the BM and surrounding bone tissue in all recipients. The
majority of the cells were located in the perivascular region
or apposing the inner-surface of cortical bone (Fig. 4 A).
Double IHC for GFP and marker molecules revealed that the
transplanted PS cells differentiated into reticular cells in as-
sociation with vSMCs (Fig. 4 B, a–c), consistent with the
normal physiological localization of PS cells (Fig. 3, A and B).
The CXCL12 (Fig. 4 B, d–f) and Ang-1 (Fig. 4 B, g–i)
expression in these cells suggested they could reconstitute the
vascular niche for hematopoiesis. GFP-positive PS cells had
also differentiated into osteocalcin-expressing osteoblasts
lining the inner surface of the cortical bone (Fig. 4 B, j–l).
In addition, in the adipose tissue of recipient mice we found
some GFP-positive cells that were also positive for perilipin
(Fig. 4 B, m–o), an adipocyte marker that is specifically ex-
pressed at the periphery of lipid droplets (Cho et al., 2007).
Combined with the localization of naive PS cells in BM
shown in Fig. 3 (A–D), these data suggested that within
16 wk of systemic transplantation, primary PS cells (MSCs),
which are normally located in the arterial perivascular space
in association with vSMCs, can give rise to osteoblasts and
perivascular cells that function as hematopoietic niche cells
(Fig. S3) or produce adipocytes when the cells migrate to
adipose tissue.
However, systemically transplanted GFP+ MSCs derived
from single PS cells in culture were not detectable 8 wk later.
To investigate this further, 105 1-mo-culture–expanded PS
cells that had been engineered to express firefly luciferase fused
to Venus (see Materials and methods) were transplanted into
lethally irradiated recipient mice. The animals were subjected
to bioluminescence imaging (BLI) analysis (Okada et al., 2005)

secondary CFU-Fs could be clonally expanded, which would
indicate their competence for self-renewal. At 16 wk after
transplantation, the bone and BM of five recipient mice were
individually collagenase digested into single-cell suspensions.
Flow cytometric analysis showed that donor-derived GFP+
nonhematopoietic (CD45TER119) cells (Fig. 5 A, left)
were <10% (mean percentage 7.35%), although the percent-
age varied in all cases. Notably, GFP+ cells belonging to pop-
ulations other than PS were found (Fig. 5 A, right). To test

minescent signals in the bilateral lung and neck were observed

of detectability by day 7 (Fig. S4). The data strongly support a
previous observation that MSCs rapidly lose their ability to
home to an appropriate site when cultured (Rombouts and
Ploemacher, 2003; Wang et al., 2005).
We further investigated whether transplanted PS cells
maintained their stem cell properties by observing whether

The identification of a marker combination that permits
the isolation of primary MSCs enabled us to examine their
physiological localization and role in the BM. We found that
primary MSCs, with abundant Ang-1 expression, were pre-
dominantly in the arterial perivascular space near the inner
surface of the bone, adjacent to vSMCs. Our data also demon-
strated the in vivo fate of primary MSCs in a systemic trans-
plantation assay. The transplanted primary MSCs (PS cells)
mainly differentiated into osteoblasts and Ang-1– and/or
CXCL12-expressing perivascular cells, consistent with a re-
cent study (Sacchetti et al., 2007). Collectively, our data con-
clusively demonstrate that primary MSCs and their descendants
mainly function in the adult BM as a hematopoietic niche in
the arterial perivascular area in BM (Doherty et al., 1998; Shi
and Gronthos, 2003).
One of the most important observations of this study is
that intravenously transplanted PS cells were integrated not
only into the BM but also into adipose tissue. Previous studies
have largely indicated that MSCs are not transplantable. The
systemic delivery of in vitro–isolated MSCs to recipient ani-
mals, although feasible, has been limited by the entrapment of
donor cells in tissues, primarily the lungs, and the few success-
ful transplantations were mostly performed by direct local or
intralesional implantation (Miyahara et al., 2006; Muguruma
et al., 2006).
As has been reported (Rombouts and Ploemacher, 2003),
we found that cultured MSCs lost their homing ability. In ad-
dition, after ex vivo expansion, even the PS cells were largely
trapped in the lung (Fig. S4) and did not contribute to any
BM compartment. Cell migration and tissue integration in-
volve a cascade of events initiated by shear-resistant adhesive
interactions between flowing cells and the vascular endothe-
lium at the target tissue. This process is mediated by “homing
receptors” expressed on circulating cells that engage relevant
endothelial coreceptors, resulting in cell-tethering and rolling
contacts on the endothelial surface; this is typically followed
by chemokine-triggered activation of integrin adhesiveness,
firm adhesion, and extravasation (Sackstein, 2005). The key
molecule that mediates the homing capacity of primary MSCs
is unknown, and its identification should be addressed in a fu-
ture study. In addition, it is also possible that BM engrafted
cells and CFU-Fs were derived from a distinct cell population
because PS cells still contain a heterogeneous population of
cells. Thus, further purification and clonal transplantation
studies would be necessary to prove our hypothesis.
Although cultured MSCs are multipotent in vitro, the
cells often commit to the osteocyte lineage after local implan-
tation (Sacchetti et al., 2007). We found that transplanted
PS cells that migrated to the BM mainly produced niche
cells, as described above, but the cells that localized to adipose
tissue differentiated into mature adipocytes. These results
strongly suggested that primary MSCs can home to their ap-
propriate niche and differentiate in response to cues from the
local microenvironment. However, the discrepancy in dif-
ferentiation potential between the in vitro and in vivo data
remains to be addressed. In the in vitro differentiation assay,
if the recovered PS cells retained their stem cell properties,
we sorted single PS cells into individual wells of 96-well
plates, and analyzed the resulting colonies. GFP+ fibroblastic
colonies generated from 2 of 96 cells (Fig. 5 B), and the 2
clones retained the ability to undergo sustained growth, as well
as the multilineage differentiation potential in vitro (Fig. 5 C).
PS cells are resistant to whole-body irradiation
Although our data showed that the prospectively isolated
PS cells (primary MSCs) migrated to appropriate sites and
differentiated into the expected cell types after systemic infu-
sion, the mean chimerism resulting from the transplantation
of 104 PS-derived cells was 7%. In contrast, 100 purified
HSCs were sufficient to reconstitute >80% of the hemato-
poietic cells (Fig. 6 A). Given that 104 PS cells contained
500 CFU-Fs, based on our 1/20 frequency of CFU-Fs in
PS cells (Fig. 1 H), the PS engraftment was lower than
expected. The observed difference might have been caused
by the irradiation protocol. That is, if the recipient’s MSCs
had not been eliminated in sufficient numbers to leave their
niche available to the donor MSCs, competition for the niche
might have reduced the number of successfully engrafted
cells (Rombouts and Ploemacher, 2003; Koide et al., 2007).
To evaluate this hypothesis, we compared the susceptibility
of HSCs (KSL) and MSCs (PS) to irradiation.
Three mice in each group were subjected to whole-body
irradiation at a dose of 10.5 Gy, a significant number of PS
cells remained among the BMNNCs after 6 d, but the HSCs
(KSL cells) were almost undetectable by flow cytometry (Fig. 6,
B and D). Interestingly, the sorted PS cells from the irradi-
ated animals mostly failed to form colonies, and the CFU-F
frequency was reduced to 1.66 ± 0.57% (33 ± 5.0% in unir-
radiated; Fig. 6 C). Because irradiation normally induces cell
death in actively cycling cells, we reasoned that the MSC/
PS cells were quiescent. Flow cytometric analysis for cell-
cycle markers showed that 71% of freshly isolated PS cells
were in the G0 phase (Fig. 6 E), which could have protected
them from lethal irradiation. These findings suggest that a
significant proportion of the PS cells are physiologically qui-
escent and therefore resistant to radiation damage and myelo-
toxicity in vivo.
DISCUSSION
Using cell-surface markers and flow cytometry, we succeeded
in prospectively isolating MSCs as PDGFR+Sca-1+CD45
TER119 (PS) cells from adult murine BM. We showed
that PS cells have primitive characteristics consistent with
conventional MSC populations isolated by adhesion culture.
Because PS cells were detected in various mouse strains
(Fig. S1) with equal CFU-F frequency and differentiation
potency, our protocol has immense potential for isolating en-
riched, primary MSCs for detailed analyses especially in vari-
ous genetically modified animals. Unlike with conventional
protocols, our protocol permits such studies to be done with
minimal contamination by unnecessary cells or the potential
alteration of cell characteristics by ex vivo expansion.

our animal facility at Keio University School of Medicine. All experimental
procedures and protocols were approved by the ethics committee of Keio
University and were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals.
Preparation of BM cell suspension
Femurs and tibias were dissected and crushed with a pestle. The crushed
bones were gently washed once in HBSS+ (Hanks-balanced salt solution
supplemented with 2% FBS, 10 mM Hepes, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin),
and the cell suspension filtered through a cell strainer (Falcon 2350) was
discarded. The bone fragments were collected and incubated for 1 h at 37°C
in 20 ml of DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 0.2% collagenase (Wako Chem-
icals USA, Inc.), 10 mM Hepes and 1% P/S. The suspension was filtered
with a cell strainer (Falcon 2350) to remove debris and bone fragments, and
collected by centrifugation at 280 g for 7 min at 4°C. The pellet was im-
mersed in 1 ml water (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5–10 s to burst the red blood cells,
after which 1 ml of 2× PBS (dilution from Sigma-Aldrich) containing 4%
FBS was added, and the suspension was filtered through a cell strainer.
Antibody staining
The cells were suspended in ice-cold HBSS+ at 1–5 × 107 cells/ml, and then
stained for 30 min on ice with the following mAbs: biotinylated or APC-
conjugated PDGFR (APA5), FITC-conjugated Sca-1 (Ly6A/E), PE-con-
jugated CD45 (30-F11), and TER119 (TER-119). Biotinylated antibodies
were visualized with APC-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen). All mAbs
were purchased from eBioscience. Flow cytometry analysis and sorting
were performed on a triple-laser MoFlo (Dako) or FACSCalibur (BD) flow
cytometer. PI fluorescence was measured, and a live cell gate was defined
that excluded the cells positive for PI. Additional gates were defined as posi-
tive for PDGFR and Sca-1 and negative for CD45 and TER119, accord-
ing to the isotype control fluorescence intensity.
Cell culture
A variety of culture methods were required for this study, including adherent
culture, CFU-F assay, cultures for MSC differentiation into mature cells, and
CFU-C assay.
Adherent culture. Traditional MSC adherent culture was performed as
described previously (Pittenger et al., 1999). Sorted cells were cultured in
maintenance medium (i.e., MEM + GlutaMAX-I [Invitrogen] supple-
mented with 10% FBS and antibiotics), incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2,
and maintained with exchanges into fresh medium every 3–4 d for 2–3 wk.
CFU-F assay. Approximately 1 × 103 or 2 × 103 sorted cells were seeded
on a 100-mm dish in maintenance medium. Adherent cell clusters contain-
ing >50 cells were counted as a colony.
Differentiation cultures. To induce adipocyte differentiation, subconflu-
ent cells were cultured with three cycles of Adipogenic Induction Medium/
Adipogenic Maintenance Medium, with supplements from the Adipogenic
Induction/Adipogenic Maintenance SingleQuot kit (Lonza). Each cycle
consisted of feeding the subconfluent cells with the induction medium for 3
d, followed by 3 d of culture in the maintenance medium. After 14 d, the
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and stained with oil
red O (MutoPure Chemicals).
For chondrogenic differentiation, cultured cells were harvested by tryp-
sinization. The 2 × 104–2.5 × 105 cells were transferred into a 15-ml conical
tube and washed with MEM + GlutaMAX (Invitrogen). The tube was
spun at 150 g for 5 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was aspi-
rated. The cells were resuspended in 1 ml Differentiation Basal Medium
Chondrogenic, with supplements from the Chondrogenic SingleQuot kit
(Lonza), spun at 150×g for 5 min, and the medium was aspirated. The cells
were resuspended in 1 ml of Differentiation Basal Medium Chondrogenic,
supplemented with Chondrogenic SingleQuots kit, TGF-b3 (10 ng/ml;
Lonza) and BMP-6 (500 ng/ml; R&D Systems), and spun at 150 g for 5 min
at room temperature. The pellet was maintained with Differentiation Basal
single PS-derived MSCs differentiated not only into chon-
drocytes and osteocytes, but also into endothelial cells and
adipocytes. However, the primary PS cells did not integrate
into vSMCs in vivo. In addition, at least within 3 mo after
transplantation, there were no detectable PS-derived adipo-
cytes in the BM. One explanation may be that naive MSCs
are extremely sensitive to tissue level elasticity in the micro-
environment and commit to specific lineages accordingly
(Engler et al., 2006).
These findings have important clinical implications. Pri-
mary MSCs transplanted by systemic infusion may be useful
for cell therapy of various systemic skeletal diseases, such
as dyschondroplasia, osteochondrodysplasia, osteoporosis, and
osteogenesis imperfecta. In contrast, local implantation is in-
vasive and can result in significant morbidity, potentially dis-
rupt the highly complex and delicate structure of the local
regulatory microenvironment, and cause additional injury.
Thus, stem cell–based therapy for systemic disorders man-
dates vascular delivery. However, this approach is limited by
the difficulty of ensuring that sufficient numbers of reconsti-
tuting cells reach the damaged areas in cases of ineffective
stem cell engraftment (Laver et al., 1987; Simmons et al.,
1987; Agematsu and Nakahori, 1991; Awaya et al., 2002;
Stute et al., 2002; Barbash et al., 2003; Meyerrose et al.,
2007). Here, we demonstrated the detection of significant
number of primary PS-derived cells in the BM of trans-
plant-recipient animals; however, the low engraftment activ-
ity of MSCs remains an unsolved problem. A key feature of
stem cells is that they are in a quiescent state in vivo. Our re-
sults clearly revealed that >70% of PS were in the G0 phase,
and the frequency of quiescent PS in the BM did not change
after lethal irradiation. These data demonstrate that although
the radiation reduced the host CFU-F colony-forming ability
in vitro, it did not physically kill the cells; instead, they re-
mained alive, but mostly nonfunctional, in their niche. Find-
ing nondeleterious ways to remove host MSCs, assuming that
the cell cycle progression of transplanted MSCs can be in-
duced, to expand the progenitor population and compensate
for cell loss, will be our next challenge. If we succeed, freshly
isolated MSCs could have great potential for correcting bone
and BM-related systemic disorders.
Overall, the approach detailed here provides a means for
researchers to study the therapeutic potential of cells from BM
as a cell source for bone components and to elucidate how in-
dividual factors function in the control and maintenance of
bone and BM formation in vivo and in a variety of health and
disease states. Advances in this field hold promise for the devel-
opment of rationale-based stem cell therapies for tissue regen-
eration and of gene therapy for inherited disorders.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
Adult wild-type C57BL/6 mice and B6.SJL-Ptprca Pep3b/BoyJ (C57BL/6-
Ly5.1;Ly5.1) mice 8–12 wk of age were purchased from CLEA Japan, Inc.
(Tokyo, Japan). Transgenic mice that ubiquitously express EGFP under the
control of the CAG promoter (Kawamoto et al., 2000) were bred in our ani-
mal facility. The mice were kept under specific pathogen–free conditions in

bioluminescent protein which emitted bigger bioluminescent signals than
general one, only 105 cells could be detected easily. Sorted single PS cell
was cultured and proliferated, infected with lentivirus, continuously propa-
gated, harvested, and then dissociated into single cells. The PI-negative/Ve-
nus-positive PS cells were sorted by a flow cytometry and transplanted
with HSCs (34-KSL).
BLI
We used a Xenogen-IVIS 100–cooled CCD optical macroscopic imaging
system (SC BioScience Corporation) for BLI. For in vivo imaging, recipient
mice transplanted with lentivirally engineered PS cells were anesthetized
and given D-luciferin (150 mg/kg body weight) i.p. We found this time
window to be optimal because the signal intensity peaked at 15 min after ad-
ministration followed by a plateau of 20 min (unpublished data). All images
were analyzed as described in Materials and methods. To quantify the mea-
sured light, regions of interest (ROI) were defined as lungs and all values
were examined from an equal ROI.
Statistical analysis.
The Tukey-Kramer test was used to compare the frequencies of CFU-Fs
among different groups. All reported p-values were obtained using the SPSS
software package (SPSS 15.0J for Windows).

Medium changes every 3–4 d for 3 wk. After 3 wk, cell clumps were har-
vested, washed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained with toluidine blue.
To induce osteocyte differentiation, subconfluent cells were cultured
with Differentiation Basal Medium Osteogenic, supplemented with Osteo-
genic SingleQuots (Lonza) for 14 d. The cells were then fixed with 4% para-
formaldehyde for 15 min and stained with alkaline phosphatase (Histofine;
Nichirei).
For vasculogenesis, sorted cells were seeded on poly-L-ornithine/
fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated 8-well chamber slides (Iwaki) with Endo-
thelial Cell Basal Medium-2 (EBM-2), supplemented with EGM-2 MV
SingleQuots (Lonza), and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2. The cultures
were maintained with medium changes every 4–7 d for 3 wk.
CFU-C assay. Cell suspensions were mixed with MethoCult (StemCell
Technologies). Cells were plated in 35-mm dishes and cultured at 37°C with
5% CO2. Colonies were scored on day 14.
Negative linear relationship assays
In this assay, the systematic dilution of cells reduces the plating cell density
and increases the incidence of wells with no colonies. The sorted cells were
seeded into 96- or 24-well plates or 100-mm dishes containing 14 cell-dose
groups: 25; 50; 100; 200; 400; 500; 800; 5,000; 10,000; 50,000; 80,000;
1,000,000; 2,500,000; or 5,000,000 sorted cells per well. After 14 d, each
well was fixed in methanol, stained with Giemsa, and the wells with no col-
onies were included in the count for each population. The concentration of
cells plated in which 37% of the wells are negative for colony growth is the
cell concentration that contains one CFU-F (Bacon and Sytkowski, 1987).
RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) assay
RT-PCR was performed as described previously (Koide et al., 2007). The
QRT-PCR assay was performed on an ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR
System using TaqMan Fast Universal PCR master mixture (Applied Bio-
systems) and TaqMan Gene Expression Assay Mix for Ang-1 (Mm00456503_
m1) or CXCL-12 (Mm004455552_m1). The -actin (actb) assay mix
(Mm00607939_s1) served as an endogenous control. Data were analyzed
by 7500 Fast System SDS Software 1.3.1. All experiments were done
in quadruplicate.
In vivo transplantation
CD34KSL cells (HSCs) from Ly5.1 congenic mice and PS cells from
CAG-EGFP transgenic mice were isolated as described above. Then, a mix-
ture of 100 HSCs and 104 PS cells were transplanted intravenously into the
retro-orbital plexus of anesthetized recipient mice that had been lethally ir-
radiated (10.5 Gy) along with 2 × 105 whole BM cells from recipient strain
mice, as radioprotective cells.
Immunostaining of BM and adipose tissue
For BM and adipose tissue sections, whole-mount staining was performed as
previously described (Kubota et al., 2008). The following antibodies were
used as a primary antibodies; anti-GFP (rabbit IgG; 1:500; MBL; and goat
IgG; 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), -SMA (1A4; FITC or Cy3-
conjugated; Sigma-Aldrich), Sca-1 (D7; BD), PDGFR (Santa Cruz Bio-
technology, Inc.), Ang-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), CXCL12
(Abcam), osteocalcin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and perilipin (Re-
search Diagnostics). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488
fluorescence-conjugated IgGs (Invitrogen) or Cy3/Cy5-conjugated IgGs
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). For nuclear staining, specimens
were treated with DAPI (Invitrogen).
Infection of lentivirus expressing firefly luciferase fused to Venus
and preparation of transduced PS cells
By using the fluorescent and luminescent fusion protein, the success of lenti-
virus infection was confirmed with fluorescent signal from Venus. After the
transplantation, the spot(s) of transplanted PS cells were followed by biolu-
minescent signal from Luciferin in mice body. Because we used the modified
