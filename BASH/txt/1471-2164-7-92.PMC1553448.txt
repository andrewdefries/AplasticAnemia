Abstract
Background: The gene expression profiles of most human tissues have been studied by
determining the transcriptome of whole tissue homogenates. Due to the solid composition of
tissues it is difficult to study the transcriptomes of individual cell types that compose a tissue. To
overcome the problem of heterogeneity we have developed a method to isolate individual cell
types from whole tissue that are a source of RNA suitable for transcriptome profiling.
Results: Using monoclonal antibodies specific for basal (integrin β4), luminal secretory (dipeptidyl
peptidase IV), stromal fibromuscular (integrin α 1), and endothelial (PECAM-1) cells, respectively,
we separated the cell types of the prostate with magnetic cell sorting (MACS). Gene expression of
MACS-sorted cell populations was assessed with Affymetrix GeneChips. Analysis of the data
provided insight into gene expression patterns at the level of individual cell populations in the
prostate.
Conclusion: In this study, we have determined the transcriptome profile of a solid tissue at the
level of individual cell types. Our data will be useful for studying prostate development and cancer
progression in the context of single cell populations within the organ.
Background
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death
among American men [1,2]. Due to the high incidence of
prostate cancer the biology of the organ has been exten-
sively studied. Crucial to our understanding of the cancer
process is the biology of prostate development, in partic-
ular, the gene expression changes that accompany epithe-
lial cell differentiation. DNA microarray technology has
revolutionized the field of gene expression profiling and
has seen wide application in the study of prostate cancer
[3-5] as well as other types of cancer [6]. A byproduct of
these studies is the gene expression profiles of most tissues
of the human body have been assessed (e.g., the Novartis
GeneAtlas). The next step in understanding how a tissue
functions at a molecular level is to determine the tran-
scriptome profile of individual cell types that constitute
the tissue. Cell-type specific transcriptomes will allow us
to more precisely define prostate cell lineages, cell-cell
interactions, autocrine or paracrine signaling pathways,
and would be useful to identify biomarkers for diseases
such as cancer.

The main problem encountered in studies of cells from
solid tissue has always been determining a method to sep-
arate the cells of interest from the organ. Our solution to
the cell separation problem was to use collagenase diges-
tion of tissue combined with cell sorting based on cell-
type specific cluster designation (CD) antigens [7]. A com-
prehensive CD phenotyping of the constituent cell types
of the prostate [8] now makes it possible to sort most cell
populations from the tissue by flow cytometry. The use of
antibodies targeting cell-surface CD markers to separate
blood cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) is
well established, and has been used for microarray analy-
sis [9-11]. In this study, we used magnetic cell sorting
(MACS) to isolate the major prostatic cell types: luminal
secretory and basal cells of the epithelium, and fibromus-
cular cells of the stroma for transcriptome profiling.
Endothelial cells were also sorted to represent a cell type
not specific to the prostate. Analysis of the transcriptomes
identified cell specific gene expression signatures and
paracrine signaling pathways that are potentially active
within the prostate.
Results
Specificity of antibodies used in MACS
The CD molecules targeted by MACS were CD26 (dipep-
tidyl peptidase IV) for luminal cells, CD104 (integrin β4)
for basal cells, CD49a (integrin α 1) for stromal fibromus-
cular cells, and CD31 (PECAM-1) for endothelial cells.
Immunohistochemistry performed with the antibodies
that were used for MACS sorting is shown in Fig. 1 and
confirms their specificity for the cell-types that were tar-
geted. The antibodies that primarily recognize basal epi-

Each prostatic gland is composed of a one-cell layer thick basal epithelium surmounted by columnar secretory cells enclosing
the luminal space. The interglandular stroma contains the fibromuscular cells and various other cell types.

thelial cells and luminal secretory cells (CD104 and CD26
respectively) show some staining of endothelial cells [8].
Therefore, the endothelial cell data was used to filter out
genes expressed by endothelial cells from the CD104 and
CD26 transcriptomes.
Cell type-specific transcriptomes
Microarray expression data from the four prostate cell
types were compared with each other. Raw data is availa-
ble in the NCBI GEO database under the accession
number GSE3998, from our website [12], and in Softma-
trix format (see Additional file 1). ANOVA was performed
on the data (5 biological replicates per cell type) to deter-
mine the effectiveness of MACS at enriching the signal of
transcript from the target antigen (Fig. 2). The CD26 and
CD49a transcripts were differentially expressed in their
respective sorts relative to the other sorts (P < 0.001), as
were CD31 and CD104 transcripts (P < 0.01), thereby
confirming the effectiveness of our sorts. To further assess
whether the populations of sorted cells provide accurate
representation of the targeted prostate cell types, we com-
pared the expression of genes documented in the litera-
ture as primarily expressed by luminal, basal, or stromal
cells with our sorted luminal, basal, and stromal datasets
(Fig. 3). The luminal cell genes CD10, CD13 and CD38
[13-15] were all found to be differentially expressed in the
CD26 populations (P < 0.05). The basal cell genes
CD138, p63, and KRT16 [8,16,17] were also differentially

expressed in the CD104 populations (P < 0.01). Finally,
the stromal cell genes COL6A3, CD56, and CD90
[8,18,19] were differentially expressed in the CD49a pop-
ulations (P < 0.05). Many of the documented cell type-
specific genes such as p63 were detected at or near back-
ground intensity level in cells that were not targeted by
sorting. The specificity of p63 protein expression to basal
cells was verified by immunohistochemistry and con-
firmed the array data (Fig. 4). These analyses indicated
that the transcriptomes generated by MACS of prostate tis-
sue were representative of luminal, basal and stromal
cells.
Comparison of cell type transcriptomes with whole tissue
To assess the value of cell sorting in transcriptome profil-
ing we compared sorted cell expression profiles with those
of whole prostate tissue archived in the Novartis GeneAt-
las project [6]. The data from GeneAtlas was produced
with custom Affymetrix human GeneChips. The Gene-
Chips we used had 22,215 probesets in common with the
arrays used in the GeneAtlas project. The 22,215 probesets
represent 15,049 genes. Comparison of the transcrip-
tomes revealed that 3,419 genes were detected in our
sorted cell transcriptomes but not in the whole tissue (see
Additional file 2). The detection of genes in sorted cells
but not whole tissue indicated an enrichment of cell-type
specific genes by sorting. Conversely, a list of genes
detected in whole tissue but not in sorted cells was also
compiled. Initially, there were 1,828 genes in the list,
detection of which could be attributed to blood cells and

other non-targeted cell types present in whole prostate tis-
sue. To account for the genes that appeared in whole tis-
sue but not sorted cells we subtracted GeneAtlas data for
whole blood in silico, which reduced the number of genes
by 80% to 352. Subtracting datasets for CD8+, CD4+,
CD34+, and CD14+ cells, which were shown in our previ-
ous work [8] to be present in the prostate, reduced the
number of genes only detected in whole tissue to 233 (see
Additional file 3). Of the remaining genes only 14 were
detected at signal levels greater than 100, which was con-
sidered to represent moderate expression (see Additional
file 4). Overall the sorted cell dataset included 98.5% of
the genes detected in the whole prostate plus an addi-
tional 3,419 genes not detected in whole tissue.
Prostate luminal, basal, and stromal genes
Our next analysis was aimed at determining which genes
were uniquely detected in each cell type and could there-
fore serve as an expression signature for that cell type.
Comparison of the genes detected in each sort by Venn
diagram revealed an expected similarity between the epi-
thelial cell types where luminal and basal cells have
roughly twice the number of genes in common than do
luminal and stromal cells (Fig. 5). To identify significant
unique expression, ANOVA was performed for the genes
determined to be present in the sorted cells. A total of 197,
150, and 632 genes had significant P-values of < 0.05 in
luminal, basal, and stromal sorts respectively (see addi-
tional files 5, 6, 7). These genes are likely to represent a
cell specific signature for the corresponding cell types. We
also note that for some highly expressed genes such as PSA
signal is detected in non-specific cell types (basal and stro-
mal in the case of PSA). The non-specific detection is due
to low levels of contaminating cells in a sort (for example
luminal cells in the basal sort), however, it is clear from
statistical analysis that the only cell type where PSA shows
significant expression is the luminal cells, as would be
expected.
Cell specific signaling pathways
Determination of cell specific transcriptome profiles
allowed us to examine the differential expression of genes
involved with signal transduction in the prostate. We
chose to investigate the expression of TGFβ family mem-
bers by applying our expression signatures to the genes
that compose the TGFβ pathway as compiled in the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). A group of
genes that are assigned to the KEGG TGFβ signaling path-
way were significantly differentially expressed as deter-
mined by ANOVA (P < 0.05) in prostate stromal cells
relative to basal, luminal, and endothelial cells (Fig. 6).
The analysis suggested that in prostate stromal cells, auto-
crine signaling via the classic TGFβ pathway might be
reduced by high expression of decorin. TGFβ paracrine
signaling from stromal cells to basal and luminal cells
appears to occur via TGFβ2 since the basal and luminal
cells express TGFβ receptors but low to undetectable levels
of TGFβ2. However, autocrine and paracrine signaling in
the prostate via the bone morpohgeneic protein (BMP)
signaling-pathway (Fig. 7), which is closely related to
TGFβ and is a component of the KEGG TGFβ signaling
system, could be enhanced by high expression of BMP4
and BMP5 by stromal cells.
Discussion
Our approach to cell specific transcriptome profiling of
solid tissues involves first identifying the specificity of CD
cell-surface markers for cell types within the tissue. CD
markers with the proper specificity can then be used to tar-
get cell types for isolation by cell sorting techniques such
as MACS. We chose MACS as the separation method for
this study because the procedure is much faster than FACS
(minutes vs. hours) and allowed us to minimize the time
cells were handled. We determined transcriptome profiles
of four main cell types in the prostate: luminal secretory,
basal epithelial, stromal fibromuscular, and endothelial
cells. It is possible the approximately 18-hour time frame
from surgical removal to cell sorting and storage contrib-

uted to some differences in the transcriptomes of luminal,
basal, and stromal cells. Reduction of the processing time
should be considered in future studies. However, when
we examined MACS-sorted prostate cell transcriptomes,
the effectiveness of our approach was demonstrated by
the fact that luminal secretory, basal epithelial, and stro-
mal fibromuscular transcriptomes differentially expressed
genes that are well documented as specific to the prostate
cell type we intended to capture by sorting. The transcrip-
tomes revealed that luminal secretory cells were more
similar to basal epithelial cells and less similar to stromal
fibromuscluar cells, as would be expected for the two epi-
thelial cell types.
The utility of cell specific transcriptomes is demonstrated
by the identification of genes predominantly expressed in
luminal, basal, or stromal fibromuscular cells of the pros-
tate. To investigate paracrine signaling within the prostate
we applied the expression data from our cell specific
groups to the genes of the TGFβ and related signaling
pathways (as compiled in KEGG), which allowed us to
identify which cells were expressing components of the
pathways in the prostate. We chose to investigate the
TGFβ pathway because it had been extensively studied in
the prostate and is known to be involved in control of
apoptosis and growth of the prostate epithelium [20]. Our
data showed that in the cell types we assayed stromal
fibromuscular cells differentially expressed TGFβ pathway
members. Interestingly, the activity of classical TGFβ sign-
aling through TGFβ receptors may be reduced in prostate
stromal fibromuscular cells through an autocrine mecha-
nism mediated by the expression of a negative regulator of
TGFβ signaling decorin [21]. Paracrine signaling from
stromal fibromuscular to basal cells also is likely to occur
in the prostate since TGFβ receptors I and III are expressed
by basal cells.
Although our data indicates that TGFβ signaling via the
classic pathway is reduced in stromal fibromuscular cells,
activity of the closely related bone morphogenic protein
(BMP) signaling pathway appears to be enhanced. One
result of BMP signal transduction is production of inhibi-
tor of differentiation (ID) proteins [22,23]. ID proteins
are negative regulators of basic helix-loop-helix transcrip-
tion factors and have been shown to be important in
development, the cell cycle, and tumorigenesis. Our data
indicates that luminal, basal, and stromal cells of the pros-
tate express all four isoforms of the ID genes at high levels
and that the expression of IDs may be controlled by BMP4
and BMP5 produced by stromal cells. BMP4 is known to

inhibit ductal budding during development of the mouse
prostate [24]. Recent work in a mouse model system has
shown that BMP4 heterozygous adult animals have
enlarged prostates due to increased branching of the pros-
tate ducts during neonatal development [25]. BMP4 has
also been shown to inhibit growth of the prostate cancer
cell line LNCaP [26] and induce the expression of ID1,
ID2, and ID3 in cell lines [23]. Little is know about BMP5
with regard to the prostate, although its expression has
been observed to be increased in benign prostatic hyper-
plasia [27]. Our data suggests that BMP signaling from the
stromal fibromuscular cells to epithelial cells may be nec-
essary to maintain the differentiated state of the prostate
by inducing expression of ID family members 1–4 in these
cells.
Transcriptomes of prostate epithelial, stromal, and
endothelial cells provide the basis for assessing the degree
to which genes associated with prostate cancer are abnor-
mally expressed. Furthermore, cell specific transcriptomes
also allow abnormally expressed genes to be assigned to a
cell type in the prostate. Genes over-expressed in prostate
cancer include AMACR, HPN, RDH11, and TMPRSS2 [28-
31]. Confirmation that the source of these gene products
is the cancer cell population of these tissues has been pro-
vided by immunohistochemical localization studies. Our
investigation found that in benign tissue very low levels of
AMACR and HPN transcripts were expressed only by
luminal secretory cells, and not by other parenchymal
cells, while RDH11 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed
in luminal secretory cells, which provides an indication
that luminal cells are the origin of some cancers.
With respect to endothelial cells, virtually no work has
been done investigating differential expression of molec-
ular mediators of angiogenesis. We anticipate that defin-
ing endothelial gene expression patterns will be
important in understanding prostate carcinogenesis, since
tumor angiogenesis is a generic problem of significance in
tumor biology, and studies of other tumors such as colon
cancer have found it significant [32]. Our study provides
a normal endothelial transcriptome profile that can serve
as a reference for such future studies of prostate tumor
angiogenesis.
Conclusion
The transcriptomes of prostate luminal, basal, and stro-
mal fibromuscular cells we have generated are the first
such data determined for a solid tissue and are of value for
the study of prostate cancer. Future investigation of the
transcriptomes of CD sorted prostate cancer cell types will
allow us to establish more fully their lineage relationship
to the normal epithelial cell types and to discover aberrant
signaling pathway activation or repression present in can-
cer. In conclusion, we have reported transcriptome pro-
files of individual cell types collected from live solid tissue
and established a cell sorting methodology that can be
used to isolate cells from other tissues which are suitable
for transcriptome profiling.

signaling, is produced by stromal cells, which may result in
autocrine regulation of the pathway. BMP4 and BMP5 are
produced by stromal cells and may be responsible for para-
crine regulation of Inhibitor of Differentiation (ID) gene
expression in the prostate.

Methods
Tissue samples
Prostate tissue specimens were obtained from radical
prostatectomy surgeries at the University of Washington
Medical Center and processed as previously described [7].
Briefly, surgically resected prostates were inked and sec-
tioned to localize the cancer foci. Benign tissue samples
were excised from cancer-free areas of the prostates. For
sorting, the samples were minced and digested with colla-
genase in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 5% fetal
bovine serum overnight (approximately 18 hours) at
room temperature on a magnetic stirrer. The cell suspen-
sion was filtered with a 70-µm Falcon cell strainer, diluted
with an equal volume of Hanks' balanced salt solution
(HBSS), and aspirated with an 18-gauge needle. A discon-
tinuous density gradient made with Percoll (Amersham
Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) was used to partition the cells
into a stromal fraction (strom, ρ = 1.035) and an epithe-
lial fraction (epi, ρ = 1.07). The strom and epi prepara-
tions were filtered with 40-µm Falcon cell strainers before
labeling for MACS. CD49a+ cells were sorted from strom
while CD26+ and CD104+ cells were sorted from epi.
CD31+ cells were sorted from unbanded cells.
For immunohistochemistry with antibodies used for
MACS, 5-µm thick, acetone fixed, frozen sections were
used as described [8]. Each antibody was tested against
prostate tissue from three different donors. The primary
antibodies were R-Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mono-
clonal antibodies (BD-PharMingen, San Diego, CA):
CD26 (clone M-A261), CD31 (clone WM-59), CD49a
(clone SR74), and CD104 (clone 439-9B) used at a titer of
1:25, 1:25, 1:25, and 1:60, respectively. Immunoreactivity
was visualized with DAB reagents (Vector Labs, Burlin-
game, CA). Immunohistochemistry to detect p63 was per-
formed on sections of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded
tissue microwaved 15 minutes in 0.01 M citrate buffer for
antigen retrieval. The primary monoclonal antibody for
p63 was clone 4A4 (Dakocytomation, Carpinteria, CA)
and was used at a titer of 1:500. Immunoreactivity of p63
was visualized with ABC reagents (Vector Labs). Immu-
nostained sections were imaged with an Olympus BX41
microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY) equipped with a
MircoFire digital camera (Optronics, Goleta, CA). Com-
posite images were constructed with Photoshop CS
(Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA), and all source images are
available at the SCGAP website.
MACS cell isolation
For stromal cells, the strom cells were resuspended in
0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)-HBSS, and 5 µl
CD49a-PE was added for 15 min at room temperature in
the dark. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml
0.1% BSA-HBSS and centrifugation. The labeled cells were
resuspended and 15 µl paramagnetic microbead conju-
gated anti-PE antibody (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) was
added for 15 min. After incubation the positive and nega-
tive cells were separated in an AutoMACS cell sorter
(Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) using a double positive sort
program. Aliquots of positive and negative cell fractions
were analyzed by FACS (Becton Dickinson, Mountain-
view, CA) to determine the purity of MACS samples; only
>85% pure fractions were used for microarray experi-
ments. The purity level was chosen due to our own obser-
vations (unpublished data) and studies by Szaniszlo and
colleagues that showed a transcriptome of a 75% pure
sorted cell population is largely identical to a 100% pure
population [11]. The CD49a-positive cells were pelleted
by centrifugation and resuspended in RLT lysis buffer
(Ambion, Austin, TX) for storage at -80C. For epithelial
cells, the epi cells were selected with either CD26-PE or
CD104-PE. For endothelial cells, CD31-PE was used.
Affymetrix expression profiling
MACS-sorted prostate cell lysates in RLT buffer were
stored at -80C for no more than a month. Total cellular
RNA was prepared with an RNaqueous kit (Ambion, Aus-
tin, TX). Quality and concentration of RNA was deter-
mined by using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with a RNA
Nano Labchip assay (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto,
CA). Only RNA samples that were of sufficient concentra-
tion and showed no degradation were used for array
hybridization.
Gene expression by sorted cells was analyzed with Human
Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA). Five separate biological replicates of each
sorted cell population were assayed to produce a data set
of 20 chips. The GeneChips were prepared, hybridized,
and scanned according to the protocols provided by
Affymetrix. Briefly, 200 ng of total RNA was reverse tran-
scribed with a poly(T) primer containing a T7 promoter
and the cDNA was made double-stranded. An in vitro
transcription was performed to produce unlabeled cRNA.
Next, 1st strand cDNA was produced from a random
primed reaction. cDNA was made double stranded in a
reaction with a poly(T) primer containing a T7 promoter.
Finally, an in vitro transcription was performed with
biotinylated ribonucleotides to produce biotin labeled
cRNA. Labeled cRNA was then hybridized with the Gene-
Chips. The chips were washed and stained with streptavi-
din-PE using an Affymetrix FS-450 fluidics station. Data
was collected with an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.
Data analysis
CEL files produced by GeneChip Operating Software
(Affymetrix) were loaded into GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent
Technologies) via the robust multiple array average
(RMA) preprocessor. The GeneSpring RMA preprocessor
uses the same analysis algorithm for Affymetrix array data

as the open source Bioconductor project [33]. Gene-
Spring's replicate error model was used for our analysis.
Genes in the dataset with an average raw fluorescence sig-
nal <50 were considered to be undetected by the experi-
ment. Statistical significance of differential expression
between luminal, basal, stromal fibromuscular, and
endothelial sorts was determined by a parametric 1-way
ANOVA using the Benjamini and Hochberg false discov-
ery algorithm with P < 0.05. Pathway analysis was per-
formed with GeneSpring's built-in functions utilizing
human KEGG pathways release 33.0 [34]. The probeset
comparison of whole prostate tissue was accomplished by
using HG-U133A Affymetrix gene chip data in the form of
CEL files published in the Novartis GeneAtlas [6]. All of
the 22,215 HG-U133A probesets were exactly reproduced
on the HG-U133 2.0 Affymetrix GeneChip used in our
studies, therefore, the data could be directly compared
between whole prostate and sorted cells without probeset
bias. The 22,215 corresponding probesets represented
15,049 genes. The U133A CEL files from GeneAtlas were
RMA normalized and compared with the U133 Plus 2.0
data from sorted cells using GeneSpring 7.2.

Subtraction of blood-cell genes from prostate transcriptomes Number
of genes (y-axis) detected in whole prostate tissue but not sorted (x-axis
point “Prostate”). The remaining x-axis points indicate the blood-cell type
which was subtracted in silico from the whole prostate data and the
resulting number of genes is plotted on the y-axis. Subtraction of whole
blood expressed genes from whole prostate data accounted for 88% of
genes detected in whole prostate but not sorted cells.
