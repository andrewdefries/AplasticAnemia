PLATE 6
(Received for publication, August 20, 1936)
The present investigation had its origin in the suggestion that the
blood of the emergent vein of the organ or organs in which platelet
production is taking place should show a higher platelet count than
the venous blood of other organs. In order to carry out this idea it
was essential to find a satisfactory method of counting both platelets
and erythrocytesin samples of blood removedfrom the veins by means
of a syringe. Such a method was devised. It is described in detail
below. In applying this method to various arteries and veins it was
found that the platelet count, relative to the number of erythrocytes,
was, in general, higher in the arteries than in the veins, indicating an
increase in the number of platelets during the passage of the blood
through the lungs. This point, therefore, was made the subject of a
special study by experimental and histological methods, the results of
which are given in this paper.
Methods
RemovalofSamplesof Blood.--For this purpose 0.1 cc. of blood was taken from
an artery or vein by means of a 0.25 cc. tuberculin syringe (B-D). The syringes
used were calibrated with mercury, but the graduation as given by the makers was
found to be correct. In these syringes the 0.25 cc. is divided into 25 equal parts,
each representing 0.01 cc. In taking a sample of blood the syringe with needle
attached was filled with the diluting mixture to mark 15. The needle (No. 24)
was then inserted into the vessel and blood was drawn to mark 25, giving, there-
fore, 0.1 cc. of blood. The contents of the syringe were emptied into 39 cc. of the
diluting mixture and the syringe was filled and emptied three times with the
diluting mixture, so that the final dilution of the blood was 0.1 cc. in 40 cc. of the
mixture, or 1 to 400. This mixture was stirred thoroughly for 5 minutes with an
electric stirrer, the wide paddies of which were coated with bakelite varnish, and
samples were then taken for the counting chamber by means of an appropriate
177
178 PRODUCTION 0]~ BLOOD PLATELETS IN LUNGS
capillary tube. A count was made first of the erythrocytes in 10 or 15 of the small
squares (improved Neubauer ruling). This gave time for the platelets to settle
and they were then counted in the entire central ruled square millimeter. In this
way an absolute count was obtained of both the erythrocytes and the platelets, and
the ratio of one to the other could be determined.
The Diluting Mixture.--Platelets are well preserved by a number of solutions,
such as sodium metaphosphate or sodium citrate or fluoride, but for our purpose
such solutions were not usable owing to the fact that in the counting chamber there
was more or less rapid hemolysis of the erythrocytes, the "contact hemolysis" of
Fenn. This hemolysis not only prevented accurate counting of the erythrocytes,
which was desirable for our purpose, but interfered also with counting of the plate-
lets, especially in the blood of the cat with its small erythrocytes, owing to the
fact that particles given off from these latter or their "ghosts" simulated the
appearance of platelets and made the count uncertain. The mixture which proved
to be most satisfactory for our purpose in preserving both platelets and erythro-
cytes was a buffer solution of phosphates, pH 7.3, to which was added heparin dis-
solved in a 1.5 per cent solution of sodium chloride. We designate this mixture
as a heparinized buffer solution. For the blood of cats and dogs the following
formula was used.
NaCI, 1.5 per cent solution........................................ 50 cc.
Nag-IPO, (11.876 gin. per liter)..................................... 40 "
KH2PO4 (9.078 ...... ) .................................... 10 "
Heparin (crude, Hynson, Westcott, and Dunning) ................... 60 mg.
The heparin is dissolved in the mixture of salts which is then filtered. The
filtrate is boiled gently for a few minutes, cooled, and centrifugalized at high
speed for 15 minutes in sterile centrifugal tubes. The solution decanted off is
ready for use. Unless kept in the ice box it should be used within a short time
since on standing bacteria develop. Suspended particles and bacteria interfere
with the accuracy of the platelet count, hence the necessity of centrifugalizing the
mixture and sterilizing the syringes and all the containers. The counting chamber
should be cleaned carefully before using. We have found it best to wash thor-
oughly with water and then very freely with alcohol, using a cloth without lint.
While ordinarily one can distinguish between platelets and foreign particles, or
minute droplets adhering to the glass, yet contaminations of this kind or the pres-
ence of bacteria may make a count unsatisfactory or impossible. The diluting
mixture may be kept in the ice box for long periods, but should be boiled and
centrifugalized before using. It is quite possible to use the mixture two or more
times. In this case the liquid with its contained sample of blood is centrifugalized,
decanted, boiled, and again centrifugalized. Any loss of liquid is made good by
the addition of water. If not used at once it should be kept in a refrigerator and
just before using should again be boiled and centrifugalized. Stock mixtures of
the saline and phosphates may be made and used over long periods. When
counts were made upon human blood the formula was modified by using a 2 per
W. H. HOWELL AND D. D. DONAHUE 179
cent solution of sodium chloride in place of the 1.5 per cent solution, and substi-
tuting K2HPO4 for NaeHPO4.
Histological Methods.--In studying platelet formation in the lungs and other
tissues no success followed the use of material preserved in a Zenker mixture or in
mercuric chloride or picroformol solutions. When the material was preserved in
Dominici's solution and the sections were stained with a modified Wright's stain
excellent results were obtained. 1 In fixing the lung tissue the animal was allowed
to bleed to death and the Dominici solution was injected under low pressure either
into the pulmonary artery or the trachea. Pieces of the tissue were then cut out
and placed in the Dominici solution for ~ hour, and then passed through graded
alcohols, 50 to 100 per cent, imbedded in paraffin, and cut in sections of 5 to 7#.
The sections fixed on the slide were stained in the Wright's mixture according to
the procedure below. To obtain a good differentiation of platelets and platelet
material it was found desirable to treat the stained section for a brief time with very
dilute acid. In a successful preparation the platelets stand out with great dis-
tinctness owing to the characteristic brilliant color of the contained granules. The
steps in the process of staining the sections were as follows: (1) xylene; (2) butyl
alcohol; (3) methyl alcohol; (4) Wright stain for 30 seconds; (5) add twice the
amount of water and allow to stand under cover for 25 minutes; (6) wash in water;
(7) immerse in dilute acid solution (3 drops glacial acetic acid to 500 cc. water)
for 20 to 30 seconds, until blue coloring matter begins to come off in clouds; (8)
immerse momentarily in alkaline solution (sodium bicarbonate 0.25 per cent) and
then in water for 2 minutes. The specimen may now be passed through acetone
and xylene and be mounted, but experience has shown that a better differentiation
of platelets is obtained if the process is repeated. From the water the section is
treated with methyl alcohol which decolorizes it more or less completely, and then
steps 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are repeated. From the water the specimen, after removal
of surplus water from the slide, is transferred to acetone, xylene, and mounted in
balsam.
The Platelet Count in Arterial and Venous Blood
By the method described specimens of arterial and venous blood
were taken as nearly simultaneously as possible from various arteries
and veins, chiefly from the carotid and jugular, the femoral artery
and vein, and the pulmonary artery and aorta at the base of the heart.
1The Dominici fixing solution was prepared according to the formula given in
Folia haematol., 1905, 2~ 219. Downey's solution, 10 per cent formalin in phys-
iological salt solution saturated with HgCI~, also gives good results, but in our
experience the platelet material does not stain so well as after Dominici solution.
The Wright's stain used by us was prepared by Hynson, Westcott, and Dunning,
Baltimore. This stain gave us better results than any other that was tried.

per kilo injected intraperitoneally. Counts were made independently by each of
us. Successive counts on the same mixture of blood and diluting solution showed
variations of greater or less magnitude. Some idea of the extent of these varia-
tions is given by the following series made upon a specimen from the femoral vein
of a normal cat under ether. Before each count the mixture was stirred by the
electric stirrer.

Averaging the two results the count would be recorded as erythrocytes 9,620,000,
platelets, 289,500, giving a ratio of 1 platelet to 33.2 erythrocytes. When the
technique is good the method gives concordant results, but in platelet counting the
greatest source of error, in our experience, lies in the factors already referred to,
namely, the presence of foreign particles, or air droplets on the surface of the
counting chamber. When a specimen of this kind was encountered it was dis-
carded and a new one was made. In comparing the arterial and venous counts
dependence was placed upon the ratio of platelets to erythrocytes rather than upon
the absolute counts, since in spite of the care taken to obtain equal specimens some
slight variations in the amount of blood removed by the syringe were at times
unavoidable.
Comparisons between arterial and venous blood in normal anesthe-
tized cats were made in four series occurring at different times during
the investigation, and amounting to a total of 89 animals. The figures
for each of these cases are given for the first three series in order to
illustrate the variations found in normal animals. When the ratio
of platelets to erythrocytes in the companion artery and vein differed
by less than one the coufit was considered as equal in the two vessels
(see Table I).

The results show that of the total of forty-four observations thirty-
four or 77.3 per cent gave a higher count of platelets in the artery than
in the vein; eight or 18.2 per cent gave an equal count for artery and
vein, and two or 4.5 per cent showed a higher count in the vein. It is
probable that series III gives the most reliable count, since the condi-
tions were more favorable and there had been greater experience with
the technique. In this series only one of the eleven observations failed
to show a larger number of platelets in the arterial blood.
Series IV was a miscellaneous group in which specimens were taken
from artery and vein before or after various experimental procedures.
Forty-five comparisons were made. Of these 75.5 per cent showed a
larger platelet count in the artery. In 22.2 per cent the count was
approximately the same in artery and vein. In one case only was the
count larger in the vein.
We have not found in the literature any reference by other observers to a pos-
sible production of platelets in the lungs, except an interesting observation re-
ported by Simpson. In her study of the experimental production of macrophages
in the circulating blood she states that in certain cases, after the injection of
colloidal solutions, there was an enormous reduction or practical disappearance of
platelets in the blood of the right heart, while the blood of the left ventricle showed
W. H. HOWELL AND D. D. DONAHUE 183
the presenceof a normal number. The author suggests that "a remarkableprocess
goes on in the lung, whereby the distinctly abnormal venous blood is rendered
normal by the time it reaches the left ventricle." We have tried to repeat this
interesting observation upon cats by the use of India ink, given in single large
doses or in smaller doses over a number of days, but so far have been unsuccessful.
H6ngo and Ma6da in their paper upon hematopoiesis in the lungs report that in
rabbits after intravenous injection of colloidal iodine or silver, especially if accom-
panied by hemorrhage, a condition of myeloid metaplasia develops in the lungs.
Lung smears show the characteristics of marrow smears. They state that similar
results were obtained by Iishimas. They make no reference, however, to platelet
production.
Occasional references are found in the literature to comparative counts of
platelets in arterie~ and veins, especially the splenic artery and vein in connection
with the supposed function of the spleen as a destroyer of platelets. The general
view has been that the splenic vein contains fewerplatelets (Galloway). The only
report of comparative observations on a larger scale that we have been able to find
is in the paper published by Holloway and Blackford. They report experiments
upon some twenty dogs in which comparisons were made between the splenic
artery and vein, the jugular and carotid, and the femoral artery and vein. With
few exceptions their counts showed a larger number ofplatelets in the veins, a result
just the reverse of ours. But it may be said that the method used by them to get
their specimens of blood could scarcely be expected to give accurate results for
platelets. They punctured the artery or vein and took specimens from the blood
as it flowed out. Some of their results showed differences that in themselves
would seem to indicate the inadequacy of the method, e.g.,femoral artery, 75,000,
femoral vein, 342,000.
Comparison of Counts in Artery and Vein under Conditions Causing a
Reduction in Platelets.--The conclusion suggested by the above obser-
vations on normal animals is strengthened by the results of experi-
ments in which the number of circulating platelets was first reduced by
various methods. The most direct of these methods, perhaps, is the
one used by Duke in which the animal is bled repeatedly in small lots
and the blood after defibrination is reinjected. Cats upon which
this operation had been carried out were examined in some cases
shortly after the operation, in other cases 1 day, 3, and 5 days after
the operation. Brief reports are given of the results obtained (see
Table II).
In all of these experiments the number of platelets in the artery
was distinctly greater than in the vein. The difference was most
marked so far as the ratio is concerned when the blood was examined
184 PRODUCTION OF BLOOD PLATELETS IN LUNGS
shortly after the operation or within 24 hours, owing to the reduced
number of platelets. After 3 to 5 days when the regeneration of the
platelets, which Bunting has shown precedes that of the erythrocytes,
had made considerable progress toward normal, the difference between
artery and vein approached that found under normal conditions.

In another series the platelets were reduced by the intravascular
injection of saponin (Table III). The actual effect of the saponin on
the platelets was not determined since in these experiments a prelimi-
nary blood count was omitted. It would seem, however, from the
figures, that it caused some reduction in platelets, except in the experi-

ment of June 25, in which, in spite of the fact that a large dose was
given, the number of platelets appears to have been increased. In all

of the experiments the arteries were found to contain more platelets
than the veins and the difference, as regards the ratio, was greater,
186 PRODUCTION OF BLOOD PLATELETS IN LUNGS
except in the experiment of June 25, than was found under normal
conditions.
In a third series the platelets were reduced by means of a peptone
solution made up in 0.9 per cent sodium chloride and injected intra-
venously in amounts equal to 0.3 gm. of peptone per kilo of animal.
In these cases the blood was examined shortly after the injection, since,
as Pratt and others have shown, the effect of peptone upon the number
of platelets is only transitory, largely disappearing within an hour or
two (Table IV).
Comparison of Arterial and Venous Blood of Special Regions.--The
prevalent view that platelets are formed in the bone marrow made it
desirable to examine the blood of the emergent veins of the long bones,
but on account of their small size in the cat this was not practicable
for the method we were using.
VenaAzygos: The vena azygos, however, which brings back blood from the
ribs and other tissues is of large size, and it would seem probable that if the red
marrow is the sole source ofplatelet production the blood of this vein should show a
larger number of platelets compared with other veins, or the arteries. In the
observations made upon this vein the thorax was opened along the mid-line of the
sternum, the two lowermost ribs on the right side were cut away, and the vein was
ligated just above the diaphragm. A specimen was then taken from the vein
where it bends over to join the superior cava. Ten such experiments were made.
In nine of the ten experiments the ratio of platelets to erythrocytes was lower in
the blood of the vena azygos than in that of the left auricle or aorta. In one the
ratio was the same. HepaticVein:In the experiments made upon this vein the
inferior cava was ligated below the diaphragm. The thorax was then opened and a
specimen of blood was taken from the cava above the diaphragm. The blood
count from it was compared with that of a specimen from the portal vein taken
either before or after the ligation of the inferior cava below the diaphragm. Seven
observations were made. In five of them the platelet count was lower in the
hepatic blood than in the portal blood. In the other two cases the platelets in
the hepatic blood were slightly in excess, as judged by their ratio to the erythro-
cytes. The evidence, therefore, indicates that the blood loses rather than gains in
platelets in passing through the liver. SplenicVein:Specimens of splenic blood
were taken either from the main trunk where it joins the mesenteric vein or from
one of the smaller veins near its emergence from the spleen. They were compared
with specimens of arterial blood taken from the abdominal aorta. Eleven observa-
tions were made. In ten of them the platelet count was lower in the splenic vein
than in the aorta. In the remaining case the count was approximately identical.
Here also the evidence indicates a loss of platelets in the blood passing through the
spleen. SuperiorMesenteric Vdn: Comparative counts were made in ten cases
W. H. HOWELL AND D. D. DONAHUE 187
of specimensof blood taken fromthe superiormesentericvein and the abdominal
aorta. In sevenof them the platelet count in the vein was lowerand in three the
ratios were practically the same, indicating the probability that the blood loses
platelets in passingthrough the capillariesof the intestine.
Observations upon Human Blood.--It is desirable, of course, to
extend these comparative counts to animals other than the cat, and,
especially, to ascertain whether a similar difference holds for human
blood. Some few observations of this kind that v~ewere able to make
may be referred to briefly in this connection. It happens that in one
of the authors the radial artery of one wrist is easily accessible
and several counts were made upon specimens taken from this artery
compared with venous blood from the median cubital vein at the
elbow. Two or more counts were made by each observer and the
averages were used in making the comparisons.

* The last two counts were made in connection with an experiment on the effect of
occlusion of the veins. The subject was not well at the time and was subsequently sent
to the hospital. This fact probably accounts for the unusually low platelet count.
188 PRODUCTION OF BLOOD PLATELETS IN LUNGS
In eight of the ten examinations the number of platelets was larger
in the artery, in one the count was practically the same, and in one it
was slightly larger for the vein. If one takes the average of the ten
observations, as seems to be permissible, since they were made upon

Several observations were made upon patients in the Johns Hopkins
Hospital showing hemorrhagic conditions, chiefly cases with thrombo-
cytopenia or purpuric symptoms. When there was distinct thrombo-
cytopenia the difference in count between artery and vein was quite
marked, but the figures, as far as they go, do not support the view of
those who have suggested that the low count is due to increased
destruction of platelets rather than to diminished production. The
specimens of blood were taken for us by different members of the
hospital staff, arterial blood from the radial artery and venous blood
from the median cubital vein (Table V). With the exception of the
last case the platelet count in the artery was larger than that in the
vein.
PerfusionExperiments
In their experiments upon perfusion of the marrow of the tibia with
oxalated saline, Drinker and Drinker comment upon the fact that in
the perfusate no platelets were found. Following this suggestion a
series of experiments was carried out in which the lungs and other
organs were perfused with a platelet-preserving solution, and the
perfusate was examined at certain intervals for its content in platelets
and erythrocytes, and the proportion of one to the other.
The lungs were perfused through the heart. An inflow cannula was placed in
the superior cava and an outflow cannula in the aorta at its origin from the heart,
and the vena azygos and inferior cava were ligated. The perfusing fluid used in
all the experiments was the saline phosphate, pH 7.3, described above in the
method for haakingplatelet counts, but without the heparin. In some experiments
the perfusion was continuous, in others a certain volume was recirculated for a
time and was then followed by a continuous perfusion. It was found that this
solution sooner or later set up an edema of the lungs which terminated the experi-
ment. In the later experiments this difficulty was avoidedby the introduction of a
certain amount of egg albumin in the perfusing fiquid. The usual procedure in
these cases was first to wash out most of the blood by passing through 200 to 300
cc. of the saline phosphate mixture and then to substitute the albuminous mixture,
a definite volume of which was recirculated ten to twelve times. This was fol-
lowed by a continflous perfusion of the saline phosphate mixture until edema began
to develop. Samples of the perfusate were removed at regular intervals, heparin
was added, and the sample was put aside for examination at the end of the per-
fusion. At the examination each sample was mixed thoroughly by an electrical
stirrer and from the mixture a specimen was taken by means of a capillary tube to
fill the counting chamber. Counts were made usually for the entire ruled area of
the chamber.
190 PRODUCTION OF BLOOD PLATELETS IN LUNGS
In the first series of experiments, in which the saline phosphate mixture was
used without the addition of albumin, comparative tests were made upon the
lungs, liver, kidney, intestines, marrow, spleen, and pancreas. The results indi-
cated clearly that in the lungs continuous perfusion brings out relatively more
platelets, that is to say, the ratio of phtelets to erythrocytes increased, as the
perfusion continued, much more markedly in the lungs than in the other organs.
A brief record of one experiment will indicate the character of the results obtained.
Nov. 16, 1934. Cat, 3 kilos, under luminal. After opening the chest speci-
mens of arterial and venous blood were examined to determine the normal ratio
of platelets and erythrocytes.

Perfusion was established through the lungs and the effluent was collected in five
lots, each divided into four parts of 50 to 100 cc., as follows, A-1 to A-4, 400 cc.;
B-1 to B-4, 200 cc.; C-1 to C-4, 200 cc.; D-1 to D-4, 200 cc.; E-1 to E-4, 400 cc.
Total perfusate was 1400 cc. An interval of 5 minutes was given between the
collection of each lot. Artificial respiration was maintained throughout the
experiment.

The figures show that as the washing out proceeded the number of
erythrocytes and platelets in the effluent varied irregularly, the eryth-
rocytes showing a decreasing trend. The ratio of platelets to erythro-
cytes in the circulating blood before perfusion was approximately 1
to 16, but this ratio increased more or less steadily in the effluents until
at the end there were nearly two platelets to each erythrocyte. The
result would seem to indicate some kind of a supply of platelets in the
lungs.
Similar experiments made upon other organs gave a different result. For
example, kidney, total perfusion 1.5 liters. Initial ratio of platelets to erythrocytes
W. H. HOWELL AND D. D. DONAHUE 191
in the circulating blood 1 to 13. During the perfusion this ratio varied irregularly
between 1 to 8 and 1 to 35, but at the end of the peffusion was 1 to 10.
Spleen and Pancreas (and Part of Stomach).--Total perfusion 2 liters. Initial
ratio of platelets to erythrocytes in the circulating blood 1 to 20. During the
perfusion the ratio varied irregularly between 1 to 13 and 1 to 29. In the last
perfusate it was 1 to 19.5.
Intestines.--Total perfusion 2 liters. Initial ratio of platelets to erythrocytes
in circulating blood 1 to 30. During the perfusion the ratio varied between 1 to 15
and 1 to 7. In the last perfusate it was 1 to 18, but in the last three samples col-
lected the platelets were so few in number, one or none in the entire ruled field of
the counting chamber, that the ratio lost its significance. The important fact,
however, was the small number of platelets washed out of the tissue compared
with the lungs.
Tibia.--The intention in this case was to peffuse the marrow of the tibia. The
inflow cannula was inserted into the popliteal artery above the knee joint, and an
attempt was made to ligate all branches except those entering the tibia. This was
not successful as was evident f.rom the volume of the outflow, so that the experi-
ment gave the result of a perfusion of the marrow together with some of the
muscles and tissue surrounding the tibia. Total perfusion something less than a
liter. Initial ratio of platelets to erythrocytes in the circulating blood 1 to 20.
During peffusion this ratio varied between 1 to 16 and 1 to 7.5. In the final efflu-
ent the ratio was 1 to 15, but here again the platelets toward the end of the per-
fusion were so few in number that a small difference in the count made a large
change in the ratio.
Liver.--Total perfusion 1½liters. Inflow cannula in portal vein. Initial ratio
of platelets to erythrocytes in circulating blood 1 to 17. During peffusion the
ratio varied between 1 to 15.5 and 1 to 6. In the final peffusate the ratio was 1
to 8.
In the second series of experiments the perfusion fluid containing albumin was
employed. As stated above the organ was first washed out with the saline phos-
phate mixture. This was then replaced by the albumin mixture, 100 to 150 cc.
of which was recirculated ten or more times. This was followed by a continuous
peffusion of several hundred cc. of the saline phosphate mixture. Artificial respi-
ration was maintained throughout the experiment. The results in the case of the
lungs were striking as may be seen from the data of two experiments. Dec. 3,
1934. Initial perfusion with saline phosphate mixture 500 cc. Perfusate col-

The results of these two experiments seem to indicate that a source

out with the liver. While the results showed a decided increase in the
platelet ratio the increase was not comparable to that exhibited by the
lungs.

Histology of Platelet Formation in the Lungs
Our experimental results indicated that platelet formation takes
place in the lungs, and a histological study of the lungs was made by
means of sections and smears to determine if possible the source and
mode of production of the platelets.
LungSmears.--Smearsor impressions were made from a freshly cut surface of
the lungs in normal animals and in animals in which the process of platelet forma-
tion had been accelerated by previous experimental reduction of the number of
platelets in the circulating blood. The smears after d.ryingwere stained after the
manner of blood smears in Wright's stain. These preparations while interesting
were not very informativein regard to the origin of the platelets. In many of the
slides numerous platelets were found, singly or in small or large groups, clearly
marked out by their characteristic staining. They varied greatly in sizeand form,
from the typical small platelet with a diameter of 2 to 4~ to large forms the sizeof
an erythrocyteor much larger. In many casesplatelet massesoccurred, elongated
or oval or circular in form. These masses showed the characteristic staining of
platelets, namely, a bluish ground substance thickly dotted with red-purple
granules.
The lungsmears showednumerous so called dust cellsand not infrequentlysome
of these were found to contain one or more platelets, but after careful study of
many preparations we were convinced that this represented merely an occasional
ingestion of platelets by these phagocytic cells and had no bearing upon the
problem of platelet production.
Lung Sections.--The lungs were preserved in Dominici's solution,
injected through the pulmonary artery or trachea, and were stained
with Wright's stain, according to the method previously described.
In such specimens platelets are found in numbers lying in the capil-
laries, singly or in groups, and also in the larger vessels scattered
among the red corpuscles. They are very distinct on account of their
characteristic staining. One cannot overlook them or mistake them
for any of the other elements present. In addition one finds here and
there in the preparation, in amounts that vary with conditions, what
may be called platelet masses or platelet processes containing the
characteristic red-purple platelet granules. These processes are of all
sizes and shapes. Sometimes small oval bodies that might be desig-
nated as giant platelets, but frequently very large masses, or long
strings lying in the capillaries (Fig. 7).
194 PRODUCTION OF BLOOD PLATELETS IN LUNGS
These processes or masses are not agglutinated platelets. The platelet gran-
ules are dispersed uniformly and not gathered into groups, as in the case of masses
of agglutinated platelets. Their histology and the results of our examinations
indicate that they are cast off pseudopodia or processes from the cytoplasm of the
giant cells. They form a striking feature in sections of the lungs, particularly in
the lungs of animals in which the process of platelet production has been acceler-
ated by experimental methods, but they are present also in the lungs of normal
animals, sometimes scanty, sometimes quite abundant. Their presence seems not
to have been noted by most writers, but Bunting (1911) calls attention to their
occurrence in the lung of the rabbit, under conditions of accelerated platelet pro-
duction, as also in the circulating blood in Hodgkin's disease. In the marrow or,
under some conditions, in the spleen similar detached platelet processes may be
seen, but usually in the immediate neighborhood of a megacaryocyte, so that there
may be a question as to whether they are really thrown off pseudopodia from a
giant cell or whether the plane of the section has been such as to cut them off from
the cytoplasm of the cell. In the lungs this doubt does not arise, the processes lie
free in the blood vessels wholy separate from the giant cells.
The GiantCells, Megacaryocytes,of the Lungs
The presence of giant cells in the lungs has been noted by many
authors since they were first described and discussed by Aschoff. In
most cases they are described as naked and degenerating nuclei with-
out cytoplasmic material, although Aschoff himself speaks of the
occurrence of some cells with surrounding cytoplasm, and Bianchini
also refers to the presence of megacaryocytes with surrounding cyto-
plasm filled with azurophilic granules. The general opinion, however,
has been that the giant cells in the lungs are migrants from the bone
marrow (or spleen) which have lost their cytoplasm in the process of
platelet formation before reaching the lungs, or in any case shortly
after being caught in the lung capillaries, so that they appear usually
as naked and degenerating nuclei, exhibiting evidence of pycnosis.
The results of our study lead us to an entirely different view.
In the lung of the normal animal (the catwas used chiefly in our observations
although corroborative results were obtained from the dog) giant cells are found
in the sections in all cases, but in variable numbers, depending on the animal or
possibly the luck of the section. In some cases in the normal cat they were quite
numerous, as many, for example, as forty to an area of 100 sq. ram. Under
experimental conditions, which caused an accelerated production of platelets, the
number of giant cells in the lungs might be at least four times as great. They
differ greatly in appearance. Some of them, perhaps most of them under ordinary
W. H. HOWELL AND D. D. DONAR-UE 19~
conditions, are the so called naked nuclei with no appearance of cytoplasm. Petri
contends that they always show a small protoplasmic non-granular zone, sharply
bordered, and in our preparations there seemed to be at times a narrow basic rim
of cytoplasm, and in cases when a nucleus could be followed through serial sec-
tions, what seemed to be a naked nucleus might be found to have cytoplasmic
process attached to some part of its periphery. In very many cases what would
ordinarily be called a naked nucleus showed caps of cytoplasmic material at the
ends of the elongated or branched nucleus, the caps being composed of platelet
material containing purplish red granules which stood out in marked contrast to
the blue nucleus. It seems probable that with stains that do not bring out the
platelet granules these short processes of cytoplasm would be overlooked. In
some cases nuclei of this type predominated and gave the impression of cells that
might be in a state of active production of platelet material, the processes being
cast off rapidly to form platelets.
In addition to this type of giant cell one finds in the lung of the normal animal
and especially in the lung of animals in which platelet production had been accel-
erated, giant cell nuclei with one or more cytoplasmic processes attached, the
processes being composed entirely of platelet material with its characteristic
granules (Figs. 1 to 6). The processes varied greatly in size and shape and number;
sometimes a single finger-shaped projection from one pole of the nucleus, or
extending out from each of the several poles of a branched nucleus, sometimes
very massive processes that entirely filled the capillary or small vessel in which
they lay, and at other times a long branching process that penetrated the capil-
laries for a considerable distance, showing constrictions and swellings along its
course. Owing to the frequently twisted shape of the nucleus and the projection
of the cytoplasmic processes in different planes, it would be more or less a happy
accident to get a section through any one giant cell of this character that would
show its entire outline. Some of these cells show a quite extraordinary wealth of
cytoplasmic processes pushing through the capillaries in many directions. As
stated previously these processes are made up entirely of platelet material and are
identical in appearance with the platelets themselves, and with the detached
processes or masses found scattered through the blood vessels of the lungs. There
would seem to be no doubt that these latter are broken off or detached processes of
the giant cells and that by constriction or fragmentation they give rise to platelets.
In general the giant cells of the lungs are different in appearance from the typical
megacaryocyte with its crown or basket nucleus as found in the marrow or spleen.
It is very rare, indeed, to find one with the nucleus placed centrally in the cyto-
plasm and showing a distinct lobulated or polymorphic appearance. Usually the
nucleus is an elongated oval or is pulled out into a Y or branched form, and the
cytoplasm springs from the ends or from separate points along the sides. The
nucleus sometimes shows evidence of a polymorphic form but in other cases
appears like a greatly enlarged single nucleus. In our preparations these nuclei
do not show any indication of degeneration. While staining somewhat deeply
196 PRODUCTION OF BLOOD PLATELET$ IN LUNGS
throughout with the basic dye (blue) there is no indication ofpycnosis. We have
seen distinctly degeneratingnuclei with pycnotic staining more frequently in the
giant cellsofthemarrowthan in thoseofthe lungs.
The giant cells of the lungs whether naked or with cytoplasmic
processes have the appearance of active growing cells, and there can
be no doubt that the cytoplasm consists of platelet material and gives
origin to circulating platelets. The figures that we have reported in
regard to the number of platelets in arterial and venous blood would
seem to show that platelets are produced in the lungs. Granting that
the blood does receive an accession of platelets in passing through the
lungs, the histological examination gives no indication of a source of
this platelet production other than from the cytoplasm of the giant
cells.
The Origin of the Megacaryo6ytesof the Lungs
The prevalent view is that first suggested by Aschoff, namely, that
the giant cells of the lungs are migrants from the bone marrow, or in
the newly born or very young animal from the spleen. They are
supposed to escape into the circulation and become trapped in the
capillaries of the lungs. No very good direct proof has been furnished
for this view. The possibility, however, that such a migration may
occur is indicated by the fact that in a variety of pathological condi-
tions, especially in myelogenous leucemia, megacaryocytes are found
in the circulating blood. It is stated also that conditions, experimental
or pathological, which tend to increase the number or activity of the
megacaryocytes of the marrow bring about a parallel increase in the
giant cells of the lungs. This, however, is not conclusive proof of the
migration theory, since it seems obvious that conditions which stimu-
late the multiplication or functional activity of megacaryocytes might
affect those in the lungs as well as those in the marrow. In sections of
the marrow or .the spleen one may find occasionally a mature mega-
caryocyte lying free in a large vein, in a position to be swept on into
the circulation, and this fact may be accepted as indicating the pos-
sibility of an escape of these cells from the marrow or spleen, although
in itself it can scarcely serve as a demonstration that all the mega-
caryocytes of the lungs have such an origin. It may be said, however,
W. H. HOWELL AND D. D. DONAHIFE 197
that if this origin is accepted it does not follow that the giant cells of
the lungs are on the way to degeneration and play no functional r61e.
Our observations indicate on the contrary that in their new environ-
ment they are active in the production of platelets and give no indica-
tion of degenerative changes. The histological evidence for their
participation in platelet formation is in fact more convincing than in
the case of the marrow. So called Wright's figures are not always
conspicuously in evidence in sections of the marrow, whereas in the
lungs giant cells found with cytoplasmic processes are quite obviously
engaged in the manufacture of platelets.
The alternative view to the migration theory is that the mega-
caryocytes are formed or developed in the lungs themselves. Some
authors have taken this position. The results of our studies lead us
to adopt this view, since the number of giant cells found at times in
the lungs, and their evident activity in the production of platelets,
hardly seems consistent with the theory that they are degenerating
cells that have been cast off from the marrow.
It is usually assumed that the lung capillaries have a special tend-
ency to hold back foreign material in the circulation, and would,
therefore, be likely to filter out giant cells, if present. This belief
was not supported by direct experiments. Freshly prepared emulsions
of bone marrow were injected into the pulmonary artery, or one of its
branches. On subsequent examination of the lung tissue, treated in
this way and preserved and stained by the methods described, we could
not satisfy ourselves that there was any increase in the number of
megacaryocytes present, and those that were found did not exhibit
the characteristics of the marrow cells with their distinctive nucleus
and surrounding cytoplasm; they all belonged to the type usually
present in the lungs.
The origin of the megacaryocyte is a much discussed question con-
cerning which many different opinions have been expressed. Our
study of the cell as it is found in the lungs, marrow, spleen, and liver at
different ages and under different conditions has led us to accept
the view proposed by Naegeli that they develop from a myeloblastic
cell, which in its youngest stage possesses a clear nucleus with a con-
spicuous nucleolus and a narrow rim of cytoplasm that takes a deep
basic stain with the Wright mixture. One finds in sections what seem
198 PRODUCTION OF BLOOD PLATELETSINLUNGS
to be transitional forms between this cell and the young or immature
form of the megacaryocyte with its large nucleus, single or lobulated,
and its small zone of non-granular basic cytoplasm. In sections of
the lungs, especially in those animals in which platelet production
has been stimulated by defibrination of the blood or by the injection
of peptone solutions, similar myeloblastic or lymphoblastic cells are
found in numbers. They lie free in the capillaries much as they do in
the liver capillaries of the fetus. They exhibit a great variety in size
and shape. Transitional forms or what seem to be transitional forms
between it and the giant cell of the lung may be found in which the
nucleus is greatly enlarged and the cytoplasm begins to show the
appearance of granules and takes a purplish stain. The origin of these
myeloblastic cells is not evident. They are found in connection with
megacaryocytes in the liver of the fetus, in the spleen, the marrow, and
the lungs. When conditions are such as to le~d to an increase in the
number of megacaryocytes in the lungs there is a corresponding in-
crease in number of these cells. In the lung of the embryo cat near
term, or in the newly born kitten, when giant cells are just beginning
to appear in the lungs, some of these myeloblastic cells will be found.
In the kitten of 1 or 2 months, when the number of giant cells in the
lungs is noticeably increased, the myeloblastic cells are conspicuous
on account of their number and their apparent activity, as indicated
by their large size and varying shapes. The histological picture
indicates a relationship between these cells and the megacaryocytes
and tends to support the theory that the giant ceils develop from them
in the lungs after birth, as they do in the liver before birth.
Megacaryocytes of the Bone Marrow and Other Tissues
Most of the authors who have studied the subject (Bunting, Ogata,
Di Guglielmo, Kuczynski, Cesaris-Demel, Firket, Bianchini, Downey,
Minot, Sabin, et al.) have accepted the theory of Wright that the blood
platelets are produced from the cytoplasm of the megacaryocytes,
and that in the adult animal this process takes place in the bone
marrow. Sections of the marrow of the cat (femur), preserved and
stained by the methods described, give excellent examples of the
appearances described by Wright. The megacaryocytes are present
in numbers, both in the immature and the mature form. In the latter
W. H. HOWELL AND D. D. DONAHUE 199
the cytoplasm is filled with granules that stain like those in the blood
platelets, and frequently the cytoplasm sends out processes or pseudo-
podia which at times penetrate into the blood channels. The picture
as a whole can scarcely be given any other interpretation than that
proposed by Wright. There are, however, some known facts which,
on the surface, at least, seem to be at variance with this interpretation,
so far as the marrow is concerned. In sections or smears of the
marrow few platelets are found. They are noticeably less numerous
than in the lungs or spleen, and are fewer in number than would be
expected on the theory that they are being constantly produced by the
marrow megacaryocytes. Cramer and Drew have commented upon
this fact, and it will be remembered that in our perfusion experiments
which included the bone marrow, as in those of Drinker and Drinker
in which the marrow alone was perfused, the e~uent was very deficient
in platelets. There was no indication of a supply of these elements in
the marrow comparable to that found for the lungs. Clinical and
experimental data reported from various sources indicate a lack of
correlation between platelets and marrow megacaryocytes. The
platelets may be reduced greatly in number or entirely eliminated
with no obvious change in the number of megacaryocytes, or the
marrow may show no megacaryocytes while the blood stiU contains
platelets (Bianchini, Barbieri, Filo, Lawrence and Mahoney, Stebbins
and Cams, Willi). Observations of this kind indicate the existence of
some unknown factors bearing upon the relationship of the mega-
caryocytes of the marrow to the blood platelets. The participation
of the lungs in the process of platelet production is one such factor
that has not been considered heretofore.
On the histological side alone the connection of the mature form of
megacaryocyte with platelet formation seems so convincing that one
may assume that wherever such cells occur they are capable of dis-
charging this function. As is well known megacaryocytes are found in
several organs, and in the course of development of the fetus a certain
sequence is observed. They appear first in the liver and subsequently
in the spleen and marrow. We have been able to follow this march in
the case of the cat.
In a fetus of about 80 nun. they are just beginning to appear in the marrow of the
long bones. They are few in number and the cytoplasm is as yet immature, in
200 PRODUCTION OF BLOOD PLATELETS IN LUNGS
that platelet granules are not present. In the liver and the spleen, however, fully
developed megacaryocytes are found, those of the liver giving evidence of greater
activity, as indicated by the number that contain fully matured platelet granules
in the cytoplasm. The lungs at this age contain no giant cells. In the circulation
blood platelets are present although few in number. If the theory that they are
formed by megacaryocytes is sound, then at this time only the giant cells of the
liver and spleen take part in the process. In an older embryo, 115 mm:, not far
from term, the megacaryocytes in the liver and spleen were distinctly more
numerous and the presence of processes of the cytoplasm indicated a greater degree
of activity, but the maximum focus of activity still appeared to be in the liver.
The number of platelets in the blood was increased, reaching a figure of 55,000 per
c.mm. for a red cell count of 4,500,000. In the marrow of the femur the number
of giant cells was distinctly greater than in the fetus of 80 ram. as determined from
longitudinal sections through the entire bone. Toward the middle of the shaft
some were found in which platelet granules we#epresent in the cytoplasm.
At birth and shortly afterward the liver still contains megacaryocytes,but some
of them show signs of degeneration in the nucleus, and the seat of activity has
quite evidently been transferred to the spleen and the marrow. In the lungs at
this time megacaryocytes begin to appear, a few being found in each section.
Finally in an examination made of a cat approximately 2 months old the giant cells
of the marrow were numerous and resembled those of the adult in variety and in
evidences of activity, and in the lungs their number was distinctly larger than in
the newly born animal. In the spleen, on the contrary, no megacaryocytes could
be found.
In general, it may be said, for the cat, that several months after
birth and in the adult animal the megacaryocytes are concentrated
chiefly in the marrow and the lungs. In the marrow the histological
picture indicates active platelet production, but this inference is not
supported satisfactorily by the experimental results obtained from
perfusions of the marrow and from actual platelet counts in the venous
blood returning from the marrow. In the lungs, on the other hand,
the histological evidence for active platelet formation by the giant cells
is confirmed by the experimental results described in this paper, and
one is justified in believing that the lungs constitute the main source
of platelet production.
The functional relationship between the megacaryocytes of the
lungs and those of the marrow is uncertain. Three possibilities may
be considered. First, the megacaryocytes of the lungs may be ex-
plained, in accordance with the usual view, as migrants or emboli
from the marrow which have been carried off in the blood stream and
W. H. HOWELL AND D. D. DONAHUE 201
caught mechanically in the lungs where they remain until degeneration
and disintegration occur. We have given reasons for believing that
this view does not fit the facts in the case. Second, it may be sup-
posed that the megacaryocytes of the marrow after reaching a certain
degree of maturity migrate to the lungs where, under different and
presumably more favorable environmental conditions, they enter into
full activity. This view assumes a mechanism of adjustment or
accommodation for which there is no evidence and which seems to be
intrinsically improbable, and it implies also a more or less constant
transfer of megacaryocytes from marrow to lungs which is not borne
out by the results of blood examinations. The third view, which
seems to us the most probable, is that the lung megacaryocytesdevelop
in the lungs from myeloblastic cells in the same manner that they do
in the liver, spleen, and marrow. The reasons for the transfer of mega-
caryocytic activity from liver to spleen, and from spleen to marrow
in the early stages of life are not apparent, but there seems to be no
question that it takes place. In the same sense we may believe that
in extrauterine life the conditions favor the development of these cells
in the marrow and the lungs, and the experimental facts indicate that
the place of greatest functional activity is in the lungs. On the his-
tological evidence, however, one must admit that the megacaryocyte
wherever found has the function or the potential function of producing
platelets from its cytoplasm. It constitutes, so to speak, a unicellar
gland which gives off a solid secretion in the form of platelets. The
eventual solution or disintegration of the platelets presumably adds
to the plasma important constituents the nature and significance of
which are at present not definitely known.
1. A new fixing solution is described, which preserves the platelets
and prevents contact hemolysis of the erythrocytes, so that counts of
both corpuscles may be made in the same preparation.
2. Comparative counts of platelets in arteries and veins show that
arterial blood contains a larger number of platelets than venous blood.
This difference is accentuated under experimental conditions that
cause a reduction in the number of platelets. It is concluded that
new platelets are added to the blood in the capillary areas of the lungs,
202 PRODUCTION O1~ BLOOD PLATELETS IN LUNGS
and that there is a corresponding destruction of platelets as the blood
passes through the capillary areas of the systemic circulation.
3. Perfusion of the lungs with a platelet-preserving solution, com-
pared with that of other organs, gives evidence of the existence of a
source of platelet material in the lungs.
4. Histological examination of the lungs with a technique adequate
to give a differential staining of platelet material demonstrates the
presence of giant cells in the lungs, and supports the view that they
are active in the production of platelets.
5. In extrauterine life giant cells are concentrated in the marrow
and the lungs, with the maximum of their activity in platelet produc-
tion in the lungs.
