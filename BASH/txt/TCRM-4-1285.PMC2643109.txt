Abstract: Amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) was introduced in the late 1990s as a
less toxic alternative to amphotericin B (AmB) deoxycholate. ABLC is a safe and effective
broad-spectrum drug in the treatment of invasive fungal infections in patients with infection
refractory to AmB deoxycholate or in patients intolerant of the same formulation. The drug has
not been rigorously evaluated for primary therapy. Recent availability of several newer potent
and safe drugs has sharply curtailed the use of potentially nephrotoxic ABLC. However, AmB
lipid complex is likely to continue to play a limited albeit signiﬁcant clinical role in view of
the narrow spectrum of activity and signiﬁcant drug-drug interactions of the newer drugs and
emergence of drug-resistant fungi.
Keywords: amphotericin B lipid complex, invasive fungal infections
Introduction
Incidence of invasive fungal infections is steadily on the rise over the past few decades,
mainly due to an increase in the number of immunocompromised hosts, increasing
number of older patients, and a sharp increase in the use of vascular and other devices
(Ostrosky-Zeichner and Pappas 2006; Chamilos et al 2006; Martin et al 2003). Such
infections, in the setting of compromised host defenses, are associated with considerable
morbidity and mortality. Until 2 decades ago, amphotercin B (AmB) deoxycholate
(a polyene) and narrow-spectrum ﬂucytosine were the only available systemic anti-
fungal drugs; serious nephrotoxicity associated with AmB has long hampered its
liberal use. Arrival of a safer class of drugs, triazoles, particularly ﬂuconazole, made
an enormous impact in the outcome of patients with systemic candidiasis. In the late
1990s, almost 40 years after the introduction of AmB deoxycholate, three lipid-based
AmB formulations, namely AmB lipid complex (ABLC), AmB colloidal dispersion
(ABCD) and liposomal AmB were developed to reduce nephrotoxicity without com-
promising efﬁcacy. Additionally, within the past decade, newer triazoles (voriconazole,
posaconazole) and echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin) have
become available, thus now providing several choices to the clinician.
Availability of a large number of antifungal drugs within a relatively short period
has led to clinical dilemmas regarding the appropriate uses of ‘newer’, as well as
‘older’ drugs. This review focuses on the data on the efﬁcacy and safety of AmB
lipid complex and highlights the role of polyenes in the current clinical scene of
changing fungal epidemiology, emergence of antifungal resistance, and expanding
at-risk populations.
AmB remains the antifungal drug with the broadest spectrum of activity, effec-
tive against almost all clinically relevant yeasts and molds. Exceptions to the rule

include Candida lusitaniae (about 20% resistance), Candida
guilliermondi (Hawkins and Baddour 2003), Aspergillus
terreus (Sutton et al 1999), and Scedosporium species
(Gilgado et al 2006). All 3 lipid forms of AmB exhibit similar
spectrum of activity in vitro.
ABLC consists of AmB complexed with 2 phospholipids
in a 1:1 drug to lipid molar ratio. The 2 phospholip-
ids L-α-dimyristoylphosphatidyl choline (DMPC) and
L-α-dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) are present in
a 7:3 molar ratio (Janoff et al 1993). ABLC is characterized
by lipid stabilized AmB aggregates appearing as ribbon-like
structures. After iv administration, ABLC is rapidly cleared
from the blood, and high concentrations are sequestered in
the reticuloendothelial tissues in the liver, spleen, and lung
(Adedoyin et al 1997). At the infected tissue sites, AmB is
thought to be selectively released from the lipid complex by
the fungal lipases. The 3 lipid forms of AmB have distinct
pharmacological proﬁles. For example, in the immunocom-
promised mouse model of invasive pulmonary-aspergillosis,
ABLC (5 mg/kg/d) produced a more rapid fungal clearance
than liposomal AmB (5 mg/kg/d) suggesting that ABLC may
deliver active amphotericin to the lung more rapidly than
liposomal AmB (Lewis et al 2007).
ABLC is US FDA approved for use as second-line
therapy for the treatment of systemic fungal infections in
patients who are refractory to or intolerant of conventional
AmB or other systemic antifunal agents, have renal impair-
ment or other contraindications to AmB, or have developed
AmB nephrotoxicity. Most of the studies with ABLC were
conducted during the 1990s, and hence comparative data
with the newer triazoles and echinocandins are not available.
Such comparative studies are unlikely to be performed. The
dose recommended for use is 5 mg/kg/d, given as a single
iv infusion, for all patients including those with liver or
renal disease.
Data leading to the US FDA approval for clinical use
of ABLC were derived from 556 cases of invasive fungal
infections collected through an open-label, single-patient,
emergency-use study of patients who were refractory to or
intolerant of antifungal therapy (Walsh et al 1998). Most
of these patients had received prior AmB deoxycholate.
A second major data source is the industry supported CLEAR
(Collaborative Exchange of Antifungal Research) registry
which provides data on the efﬁcacy and renal safety of ABLC
from data on 3514 patients who had received the drug during
1996 to 2000 at Ͼ160 North American institutions (Pappas
2005) (Table 1). These registry data have many limitations:
the registry is retrospective; data collection was based on
voluntary reporting with possible selection bias; objectively
deﬁned response criteria were lacking; and follow-up of
patients was limited. The present review is largely based on
the data from the above 2 sources, combined with available
recent data (2003–2007).

Efﬁcacy and safety of ABLC therapy
Invasive candidiasis/candidemia
In the emergency-use study, the overall response rate for
patients with candidiasis (n = 91) was 71% (Walsh et al
1998). Responses were: 67% in disseminated candidiasis
(n = 42); 75% in fungemia (n = 20); and 76% in single-organ
candidiasis (n = 20). No difference in therapeutic responses
was noted for the different candida species. In the large col-
laborative exchange of antifungal research (CLEAR) cohort
registry, ABLC achieved 61% response ( cured or/ improved)
rate in 920 patients infected (invasive or noninvasive) with
candida species; clinical responses were similar in patients
infected with C. albicans and non-albicans candida species
(Ito and Hooshmand-Rad 2005) . Greater than 60% response
rate was documented in patients infected with either Candida
krusei or Candida glabrata (Table 2). Response rates to
C. lusitaniae and C. guilliermondii were 56% (5 of 9 cases)
and 33% (2 of 6 csaes), respectively. In a small (n = 74)
Spanish cohort of patients with hematologic malignancies,
complete/partial response was noted in 6 of 11 patients with
invasive candidiasis; ABLC, administered at 3 mg/kg/d, was
well tolerated (Martino et al 2005).
For invasive candidiasis, the role of polyenes has
markedly diminished with the availability of better-tolerated
echinocandins and the newer azoles. Echinocandins
have good efficacy against fluconazole-susceptible and
ﬂuconazole-resistant candidal species; the newer azoles,
voriconazole and posaconazole, have good activity
against fluconazole-susceptible candidal species and
ﬂuconazole-resistant C.krusei, but their activity against
ﬂuconazole-resistant C. glabrata is suboptimal.
Invasive aspergillosis (IA)
A prospective, randomized trial (of 277 patients) published
in 2002 demonstrated voriconazole to be superior in efﬁcacy
and survival to AmB deoxycholate (1–1.5 mg/kg/d) in the
therapy of invasive aspergillosis (Herbrecht et al 2002).
Response rates of voriconazole and AmB in the overall
study population were 52.8% and 31.6%, respectively. Of
interest, in the allogeneic stem cell group, the response rates
were much lower for both drugs (32.7% for voriconazole and
13.2% for AmB). Since this landmark study, voriconazole
has been accepted as the initial choice of therapy; however,
it is noteworthy that the trial did not use a lipid form of AmB
as a comparator and most patients in the AmB deoxycholate
arm had to stop therapy due to drug intolerance. Availability
of oral and intravenous formulations and good tolerability
proﬁle make voriconazole an attractive agent; however,
the drug may not be an optimal choice in all situations. For
example, patients with breakthrough infection while on
mold-active azole prophylaxis, patients with serious hepatic
impairment, patients with serious cardiac risk factors (eg, QT
interval prolongation) and patients with possible concomitant

zygomycosis are not good candidates for voriconazole. Also,
in voriconazole-intolerant or voriconazole-failed cases of IA,
a polyene or an echinocandin must be considered.
The CLEAR registry assessed 398 patients with IA
receiving ABLC (median dose 4.8 mg/kg/d) (Chandrasekar
and Ito 2005). Common underlying conditions were:
hematopoietic stem cell transplantaion (25%), hematologic
malignancy25%;andsolidorgantransplantation27%.Failure
of prior antifungal therapy (mostly AmB deoxycholate) was
the primary reason for study enrollment. Cure or improved
response was seen in 44% patients and a stable response
in additional 21% patients (Table 3). No antagonism was
observed when ABLC was administered after itraconazole
exposure. When therapy with ABLC was added to itra-
conazole, the response rate was low (27%), indicating the
possibility of maximizing therapy in desperately ill patients.
A 37% response rate was seen in 19 patients infected with
Aspergillus terreus, an innately polyene-resistant species.
As expected, response rate (cured + improved) with ABLC
in those intolerant of AmB (54%) was better compared with
those receiving ABLC after failure of prior therapy (39%).
Similar response rates were seen in patients receiving ABLC
as ﬁrst-line or second-line treatment (intolerant of or refrac-
tory to prior therapy). Recognizing the fact that the CLEAR
database and the study comparing voriconazole to AmB
deoxycholate have large differences, the response rates for
ABLC and voriconazole were similar.
The response rate with ABLC therapy in hematopoietic
stem cell recipients (n = 85) with ABLC was the lowest
(7%–40%) in single-site and multiple-site infections among
different groups (Ito et al 2005). Response rate was 31%
(26 of 85 patients) overall, and 21% (5 of 24) in those with
graft versus host disease. When ABLC was administered as
ﬁrst-line therapy, the response rate was slightly improved
(41%), perhaps implying earlier therapy may have a better
outcome. This compares favorably to the 31% response rate
of voriconazole among allogeneic stem cell recipients in the
Herbrecht study. Serum creatinine doubled in 12% patients
(10 of 85) and 2% required dialysis.
In the emergency-use study, 42% had complete or partial
response with ABLC for invasive aspergillosis (n = 130)
(Walsh et al 1998). Response in single organ extrapulmonary
aspergillosis was better than that with cases of disseminated
aspergillosis.
Voriconazole is useful as primary therapy for invasive
aspergillosis while posaconazole may be considered for sal-
vage therapy (approved in Europe). Itraconazole, given its
drug interaction proﬁle and suboptimal bioavailability, is no
longer an attractive agent. Among echinocandins, caspofungin
is approved for use in salvage therapy; data on primary therapy
are not available. Thus, the role of polyene therapy in IA, as in
candidiasis, has diminished. Among combination drug therapy
strategies, a newer azole (eg, voriconazole) plus an echinocan-
din, based on in vitro and animal data, is currently favored.
Zygomycosis
Zygomycosis is a serious infection of increasing frequency,
particularly in compromised hosts (Kontoyiannis et al 2005;
Roden et al 2005). Among the newer azoles, voriconazole
has no activity against zygomycetes, while oral posacon-
azole has been studied in the salvage setting in a limited
number of patients (n = 91) with a favorable outcome (60%
complete or partial response at 12 weeks, with 21% stable
response), particularly in the setting of surgical debridement

Efﬁcacy and safety of ABLC therapy
and improvement of underlying immune deﬁcit (van Burik
et al 2006).
In the CLEAR database (n = 64), a median daily dose of
4.8 mg/kg ABLC resulted in cure or improvement in 52%
and in stable disease in 20% of patients (Larkin and Montero
2003). With ABLC as second-line therapy (n = 35), response
rates in those refractory to prior therapy and those intolerant
of prior therapy were 48% (11 of 23 patients) and 58% (7 of
12 patients) respectively. As expected, surgical debridement
was performed in most patients.
Therapy with a lipid form of AmB (at 5–10 mg/kg/d)
is the currently accepted approach for zygomycosis until
more data with posaconazole become available. In current
practice, after stabilization is achieved with polyene therapy,
switching over to oral posaconazole (400 mg twice daily)
is becoming common. Duration of therapy remains unclear,
and is usually based on control of infection and correction
of underlying immune deﬁcit. Given the high frequency of
nephrotoxicity with AmB deoxycholate, this formulation is
no longer appropriate for zygomycosis.
Cryptococcosis
With the availability of antiretroviral therapy for the
management of AIDS, the incidence of cryptococcosis has
markedly declined. Cryptococcosis is one of the few fungal
infections for which a polyene is still advocated as primary
therapy. AmB deoxycholate (0.7 mg/kg/d) plus ﬂucytosine
(100 mg/kg/d) for an initial 2 weeks followed by ﬂuconazole
(400 mg/d) for an additional 8 weeks is widely accepted as
the standard treatment (Saag et al 2000).
In the CLEAR database, 101 patients with cryptococcoccal
infection were evaluable (Baddour et al 2005). Response rates
(cured or improved) with ABLC were 65% (51 of 78 patients)
for patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement
and 70% (16 of 23) for those without CNS involvement.
Response rates were 56% (19 of 34 patients) for patients who
were refractory to prior antifungal therapy, and 65% (11 of
17) for patients who were intolerant of prior fungal therapy.
First-line therapy (n = 44) achieved a 75% response rate
while second-line therapy (n = 56) had a 59% response rate.
In the compassionate-use protocol, 11 patients were given
ABLC (median dose 4.9 mg/kg/d) for cryptococcosis; these
patients were refractory to or intolerant of AmB or had pre-
existing renal impairment (Walsh et al 1998). Seven of 11
had complete or partial response. In a study comparing ABLC
(5 mg/kg/d) and AmB deoxycholate (0.7–1.2 mg/kg/d) for
the treatment of patients with AIDS-associated cryptococcal
meningitis, clinical response of 86% (18 of 21 patients) was
observed with the former and 65% (11 of 17 patients) with
the latter (Sharkey et al 1996).
From the above body of data, it may be concluded that
ABLC is an effective drug for the treatment of cryptococcal
infection in patients with refractory to or intolerant of prior
therapy with AmB deoxycholate. Also, ABLC appears at
least as effective as AmB deoxycholate as initial therapy.
Currently, azoles (including voriconazole and posaconazole)
or echinocandins are not considered the drugs of choice for
initial therapy of cryptococcosis.
Fusariosis
Fusariosis is an uncommon fungal infection. Usually it is seen
in compromised patients with prolonged neutropenia or after
cortiosteroid use for graft-versus host disease in allogeneic
stem cell transplant patients. Often the infection presents with
cutaneous lesions and positive blood cultures. The organism,
in clinical laboratories, is not identiﬁed to the species level;
some species are susceptible to AmB (not to voriconazole),
while others may be susceptible only to voriconazole.
Salvage therapy with voriconazole yielded an overall
response rate of 46% in patients with invasive fusa-
riosis (Perfect et al 2003). In the CLEAR database, ABLC
was administered as ﬁrst-line therapy to 8 of 28 (29%)
patients and as second-line treatment to 20 of 28 (71%)
patients; most had infection refractory to prior antifungals
(43%) or demonstrated intolerance of prior antifungals (29%)
(Perfect 2005). ABLC was administered at a median dose of
4.5 mg/kg/d for a median duration of 20.5 days. Of the 26
evaluable patients, 12 (46%) were cured or improved, and
3 (12%) were stabilized after ABLC therapy. Patients with
normal absolute neutrophil counts (ANC Ն 500 cells/mm3
)
at the end of therapy had better outcomes than those who did
not, regardless of neutrophil count at baseline. Median serum
creatinine levels were 1.15 mg/dL and 1.40 mg/dL at the start
and end of therapy, respectively. In the compassionate-use
protocol, 9 of 11 of patients with fusariosis had a complete
or partial response with ABLC (Walsh et al 1998).
Histoplasmosis
Polyenes and itraconazole are the drugs of choice for the
treatment of histoplasmosis. Clinical response rate with
itraconazole or liposomal AmB is excellent (85%); however,
for patients with positive blood culture, more rapid clearance
was achieved with liposomal amphotercin B (Wheat et al
2001). When liposomal AmB at 3 mg/kg/d was compared
with AmB deoxycholate at 0.7 mg/kg/d for therapy of
disseminated histoplasmosis in AIDS patients (n = 81),
Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management 2008:4(6)1290
Chandrasekar
the former had improved success and higher survival rate
(Johnson et al 2002).
In the CLEAR database, 21 of 25 patients (84%) with
histoplasmosis had complete or partial response with ABLC
therapy (Perfect 2005). In patients with severe or life-
threatening histoplasmosis, therapy with a polyene drug is
preferred to an azole.
Other molds
In the CLEAR database, patients with 59 other mold infections
were assessed (Perfect 2005). Pathogenic fungi were Blasto-
myces sp (n = 17), Coccidioides sp (n = 8) and Scedosporium
(n = 11). Median daily dose of ABLC was 4 mg/kg/d and the
median duration of therapy was 14 days. Cured or improved
responses were seen in: blastomycosis – 9 of 14 patients;
coccidioidomycosis–5of8patientsandscedosporiosis–1of8
patients. Responses in other infections were: Acremoniun (2 of
4 patients), Curvularia (3 of 4 patients), Alternaria (3 of 3
patients), Scopulariopsis (0 of 3 patients), Trichoderma
(2 of 2 patients), Dactylaria (1 of 2 patients), Exophiala
(1 of 2 patients), Bipolaris (1 of 1 patient), Phoma and
Paecilomyces (0 of 2 patients).
Special populations
Children
Limited data are available for antifungal therapy in pediatric
patients (Herbrecht et al 2001). In the CLEAR registry, 548
children and adolescents were enrolled to receive ABLC
therapy (Wiley et al 205). Most were either intolerant of
or refractory to conventional antifungal therapy. All had
cancer, or had received a bone marrow, cord blood, or solid
organ transplant and then received ABLC for documented
or suspected invasive fungal infection. A complete or partial
response was seen in 55% patients with an additional 17%
with a stable outcome (Table 4). The drug was well tolerated
with modest renal impairment; it is noteworthy that 72% study
patients had received 1 or more concomitant nephrotoxins.
A subset analysis of the compassionate-use study
demonstrated the efﬁcacy and safety of ABLC in 111 pediatric
patients aged 21 days to 16 years (Walsh et al 1998). Seventy
(38 of 54 patients) had complete or partial response, and no
signiﬁcant changes in serum creatinine levels occurred from
baseline to end of therapy. In a limited retrospective study
of 46 pediatric patients (mean age 10 ± 5 years) with inva-
sive fungal infection and refractory to or intolerant of prior
antifungal therapy, therapy with ABLC had response rates
of 89% for systemic candidiasis (17 of 19 patients) and 78%
for invasive aspergillosis (18 of 23 patients) (Herbrecht et al
2001). The drug, given at a mean daily dose of 4.1 mg/kg/d
for a mean duration of 39 days, was well tolerated.
In neonates with invasive canididiasis, ABLC was well
tolerated and effective both as ﬁrst-line therapy and in those
who failed to respond to prior systemic antifungal treatment
or had drug-associated nephrotoxicity and/or underlying
renal disease (Adler-Shohet et al 2001).
Elderly
From the CLEAR database, Hooshmand-Rad et al (2005)
published their analysis of 572 elderly patients who received
ABLC for proven or suspected invasive fungal infection.
Clinical response was 56% in those Ͼ65 years of age
(n = 572) and 51% in those Ͻ65 years of age (n = 2930)
(p = 0.049). Despite higher pretreatment serum creatinine
values in the elderly (1.7 mg/dL vs 1.4 mg/dL), both groups
showed only a 0.1 mg/ dL rise in median serum creatinine
level from baseline to end of therapy (p = 0.54).

Efﬁcacy and safety of ABLC therapy
infections in solid organ recipients who were refractory
to or intolerant of prior antifungal therapy (mostly AmB
deoxycholate) or had pre-existing renal disease. There were
79 solid organ transplant recipients (heart–25; liver–20;
kidney–17; lung–11; pancreas–1; multiple–5) who received
ABLC (median dose 4 .6 mg/kg/d) for a median duriation of
28 days for the following infections: aspergillosis (n = 39),
candidiasis (n = 20); zygomycosis (n = 8); cryptococcosis and
histoplasmosis (n = 3 each); and blastomycosis, cladosporio-
sis, fusariosis, and infection due to Bipolaris hawaiiensis,
Dactylaria gallopova, and an unspeciﬁed fungus (n = 1 each).
In the 67 evaluable patients, response rate was 58%. Response
rates for candidiasis and aspergillosis were 47% and 71%,
respectively. Mean baseline serum creatinine was 3.2 mg/dL;
64 patients (81%) had stable (n = 37) or improved (n = 27)
serum creatinine at the end of therapy.
Stem cell recipients
Both emergency-use study (59 patients) and the CLEAR
database (Ͼ800 patients) included stem cell recipients with
invasive fungal infection. Among the 59 patients, 31 (53%)
responded to ABLC treatment. Improvement in serum cre-
atinine was noted at weeks 1 to 3 and 6 (Wingard 1997). In
the CLEAR registry, response rates with ABLC among stem
cell recipients were 40% for invasive candidiasis, 40% for
invasive aspergillosis (single site infection), and 13% (1 of
8 patients) for invasive fusariosis.

Walsh et al (1998) reported that ABLC therapy was
associated with a signiﬁcant improvement in renal function,
particularly among those with pre-existing renal insufﬁciency
or nephrotoxicity caused by AmB deoxycholate. Serum
creatinine levels decreased from baseline during the course
of ABLC therapy (p Յ 0.02), and renal function improved
from week 1 to week 6 (p Ͻ 0.0003) in 162 patients with
serum creatinine values Ն2.5 mg/dL on baseline. Table 5
shows the CLEAR data for change in renal function in 3514
ABLC-treated patients (Alexander and Wingard 2005).
Serum creatinine values doubled in 13% of patients, and new
dialysis was needed in 3% of patients. Risk factors identiﬁed
for nephrotoxicity were concomitant treatment with poten-
tially nephrotoxic agents and a baseline serum creatinine
value of Ͻ2 mg/dL. In allogeneic stem cell recipients, 17%
demonstrated end-of-therapy doubling of serum creatinine
levels. In the pediatric population, there were few clinically
signiﬁcant deleterious effects on renal function (Wiley et al
2005). There was no signiﬁcant difference between the rate
of new hemodialysis versus baseline hemodialysis. Whether
rates of nephrotoxicity vary between ABLC and liposomal
AmB remains controversial. While several studies have sug-
gested that the rates of nephrotoxicity are similar, Wingard
et al reported that the baseline creatinine values doubled after
2 weeks in 14.8% (12 of 81 patients) of patients receiving
liposomal AmB, and in 42.3% (33 of 78 patients) receiving
ABLC (Cannon et al 2001; Fleming et al 2001; Wingard et al
2000). Preliminary data of a recent meta-analysis suggested
that the rates are similar (Safdar et al 2007).
Transient infusion-related events include fever, chills,
nausea, and vomiting; most abate within a few days of
initiation of ABLC, and often are managed with premedi-
cation. Such infusion-related effects appear to be less with
liposomal AmB. Other adverse events with ABLC include
hepatotoxicity, hyperkalemia, hypertension, and pulmonary
reactions.
Are AmB and lipid forms of AmB
obsolete?
Despite serious nephrotoxic potential, AmB deoxycholate and
lipid forms of AmB have long enjoyed clinical use, primarily
because other systemic antifungal drugs have been lacking.
Arrival of newer triazoles and echinocandins in the past few
years has changed the situation; because of their safety and
efﬁcacy proﬁles, these drugs are steadily edging out polyenes
from clinical practice. Nevertheless, AmB has a long track
record, possesses a broad spectrum of antifungal activity,
and remains useful particularly in the setting of critically
ill patients with invasive fungal disease where the etiologic
pathogen is not identiﬁed. Moreover, resistance to AmB has
remained rare despite decades of its use, while in contrast,
several reports of resistance to azoles and/or echinocandins
among yeasts and molds have already emerged.
Table 6 lists the potential clinical situations where AmB
deoxycholate or the lipid forms of AmB continue to serve
as useful drugs in clinical practice. With zygomycosis, until
more data become available with posaconazole, the polyenes
remain the primary drugs for initial therapy. As higher doses
are generally favored, lipid forms of AmB are preferred to
AmB deoxycholate to minimize nephrotoxicity. Likewise, in
the management of serious cryptococcosis (eg, cryptococcal
meningitis, disseminated cryptococosis), a polyene drug
in combination with ﬂucytosine is recommended; azoles
(ie, ﬂuconazole) may be useful in maintenance therapy while
echinocandins have no reliable activity against cryptococcus.

Serious endemic mycoses warrant initial therapy with a
polyene drug. For therapy of fusariosis, a polyene drug
and/or voriconazole is recommended for initial therapy,
since the different species have variable susceptibility, and
most hospital laboratories do not identify this organism
to the species level nor perform susceptibility studies.
Although voriconazole has become the drug of choice
for invasive aspergillosis, refractoriness or intolerance
to the drug may be encountered; in such cases, a lipid
form of AmB serves as an effective alternative. Finally,
given its broad spectrum of activity, AmB remains useful
as empiric therapy when an invasive mold infection par-
ticularly zygomycosis, is strongly suspected. In general,
lipid forms of AmB are preferred to AmB deoxycholate
in the aforementioned situations in view of the reduced

Efﬁcacy and safety of ABLC therapy
nephrotoxic potential of the former. It is worth emphasizing
that superiority in efﬁcacy of the lipid forms of AmB over the
deoxycholate formulation has not been established.
In children and neonates, AmB is remarkably well tol-
erated without signiﬁcant nephrotoxicity, hence use of the
polyene may continue in this population. Finally, in resource-
poor countries, since AmB deoxycholate is likely to be much
less expensive than the newer drugs including the lipid forms
of AmB, the polyene may remain an important drug in their
antifungal drug armamentarium.
Conclusion
AmB lipid complex (ABLC) is an effective and safe drug
in the treatment of invasive fungal infections caused by
yeasts and molds in many diverse compromised patient
populations. ABLC causes nephrotoxicity particularly when
used along with other nephrotoxic drugs, but it is much less
toxic than AmB deoxycholate formulation. Its efﬁcacy is
well established in patients with infection refractory to AmB
deoxycholate or in patients who are intolerant of the same
formulation. The drug has not been rigorously evaluated for
use as primary therapy. Its role in current clinical practice
is markedly curtailed, largely due to the recent availability
of effective and better tolerated newer triazoles and echino-
candins. However, concerns with the newer agents such as
limited spectrum of activity, emergence of drug-resistant
fungi and signiﬁcant drug-drug interactions assure the con-
tinued clinical use of the polyene class of drugs.
