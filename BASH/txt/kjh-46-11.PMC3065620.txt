Background
The impact of HLA matching on outcomes of unrelated donor (URD) hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation (HSCT) varies in different racial or ethnic groups. Since little is known
about the impact of such matching on URD HSCT in Korean children, we analyzed this
issue.
Methods
We analyzed the outcomes of 142 patients who underwent URD HSCT at 4 Korean medi-
cal centers. All patient donor pairs were fully typed for HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DR alleles.
Results
At a median follow-up of 22 months, 3-year survival rates for patients with 8, 7, and ≤
6 matched alleles were 88.4%, 70.7%, and 53.6%, respectively. A single mismatch (Mm)
at HLA-B or -C was associated with lower survival compared with that associated with
8 matched alleles. No significant differences were observed between single-allele and
single-antigen Mms with respect to survival rate or acute graft-versus-host disease
(aGVHD) incidence rates. HLA disparity had a greater impact on the survival of patients
with high-risk malignancy than of those with low-risk malignancy. Among pairs with a
single Mm, only locus A showed a significant association and higher risk of grade III-IV
aGVHD compared to those in patients with 8 matched alleles.
Conclusion
Disparity in HLA class I, regardless of antigen or allele Mm, adversely affected both survival
and grade III-IV aGVHD development. An increased number of HLA Mms was associated
with a higher risk of post-transplantation complications. Further investigations using larg-
er cohorts are required to confirm the effects of HLA mismatching on URD HSCT patient
outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT)
is a well-established curative therapy for the treatment of
lymphohematopoietic and congenital metabolic disease. Be-
cause there is a lack of HLA-identical related donors in
approximately 75% of the cases, during the past few years,
an increasing number of HSCTs have been performed using
HLA-matched unrelated donors (URDs) [1]. Employment
of URD introduces a number of questions and problems
in donor selection that do not occur in transplantation from
an HLA-identical sibling donor. The precise impact of HLA
mismatching on HSCT outcomes remains unclear, because
studies on the relative importance of various loci involved
have yielded different results. Nearly every HLA locus has
been reported to influence the outcome of URD HSCT; how-
ever, conflicting data have been obtained [2-4]. In American
patients, a single mismatch (Mm) at HLA-B or -C was better
tolerated than those at HLA-A or -DRB1 [5]. In Japanese

patients, however, the presence of a HLA-A or -B Mm signifi-
cantly reduced survival, whereas a Mm at HLA-C or -DRB1/
DQB1 did not [6]. Molecular typing techniques for all HLA
loci have demonstrated that serological matching is in-
sufficient to ensure an allelic match [7, 8]. High-resolution
DNA-based typing of HLA alleles has markedly improved
donor selection accuracy, resulting in improved HSCT pa-
tient outcomes. However, the relative importance of anti-
genic and allelic Mms remains unclear [5, 9].
The impact of HLA Mms on disease outcomes in Korean
children has not been determined, and the relationship be-
tween Mms and disease status has not been explored. We,
therefore, retrospectively assessed the impact of high-reso-
lution donor-recipient matching results at the HLA-A, -B,
-C, and -DR loci on patient outcomes in 142 Korean children
treated with URD HSCT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
1. Patients
This study included 142 patients aged ≤18 years, who
received HSCT from URDs at 4 medical centers (Asan
Medical Center, Seoul National University Hospital, Samsung
Medical Center, and National Cancer Center) in Korea be-
tween April 2003 and September 2009. The median follow-up
duration was 22 months (range, 1-78 months).
All patient-donor pairs were fully typed for HLA-A, -B,
-C, and -DR alleles. Details of the study population are shown
in Table 1. Underlying malignant diseases included acute lym-
phoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Nonmalignant
diseases included bone marrow failure, immunodeficiency,
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and metabolic disease.
Patients with hematological malignancies were divided into
low-risk and high-risk subgroups based on disease status
at transplantation. Low-risk individuals had ALL or AML
in first complete remission (CR), MDS with either refractory
anemia or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts sub-
types, or CML in first chronic phase (CP). All other hemato-
logic malignancies were considered high risk. Seventy-one
patients were classified as low-risk and 38 as high-risk.
Stem cell sources included bone marrow in 69 (49%) and
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized pe-
ripheral blood in 73 (51%) patients. Recipients of cord blood
were excluded in this study, because HLA Mms may have
a different impact in this patient population.
2. HLA typing and matching
All donors and recipients were HLA-typed both serologi-
cally and using PCR by using sequence-specific primers
(SSPs), and all donor-recipient pairs were fully typed for
HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DR using high-resolution molecular
typing. All Mms were classified according to the loci involved
and whether they were detected at the low- or high-reso-
lution level.
3. Definitions of outcomes
The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), defined
as the time from graft infusion to death from any cause.
Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was defined as death du-
ring continuous CR of the primary disease. Secondary end-
points included neutrophil engraftment, defined as timing
of the first 3 consecutive days on which a patient had neu-
trophil counts ＞0.5×109
/L, the cumulative incidence of
grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and
the cumulative incidence of relapse in patients with malig-
nant disease. aGVHD was diagnosed and graded using estab-
lished criteria [10]. Patients were considered evaluable for
engraftment, if they survived for at least 21 days after HSCT.

4. Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are expressed as median (range),
whereas categorical variables are expressed as proportions
and/or percentages. Descriptive statistical analysis was per-
formed to compare patient baseline and post-transplantation
characteristics. Two-sided Fisher’s exact test was used in
2×2 table analysis. OS curves were calculated using Kaplan-
Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Cumula-
tive incidence curves for TRM and relapse with or without
death were constructed to reflect the time to relapse and
time to transplant-related death as competing risks. Cumulative
incidences were compared using Gray’s test. Both analyses
were performed using Cox regression for OS, TRM and re-
lapse-related death, and logistic regression for aGVHD and
engraftment. Variables considered included HLA match, pa-
tient age, donor-recipient gender match, disease status, stem
cell source, and intensity of conditioning. All reported P-val-
ues are 2-sided, and P-value of ＜0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS Version 18.0 software program or R 2.10.1.
RESULTS
1. Types of HLA Mms present in the study population
Match/Mm characteristics of the 142 donor-recipient pairs
are summarized in Table 2. High-resolution typing (4-digit
level) revealed that 59 (41.5%) of donor-recipient pairs
matched at all 8 loci, 56 (39.4%), had 1 HLA-A, -B, -C,
or -DR Mm, 20 (14.1%), had 2 Mms, and 7 (4.9%) had
3 or more Mms at these loci. Of the 56 single-locus Mms,
25 (44.6%) were detectable upon low-resolution typing and
31 (55.4%) on high-resolution typing.
2. Overall survival
The 3-year OS in all patients was 74.1±4.0%. Univariate
estimates of OS are shown in Table 3. Using multivariate
analysis, HLA matching was shown to be the most significant
factor associated with mortality.

Mm at a single locus was associated with a lower survival
rate than was observed for 8/8 HLA-matched pairs. Table
4 shows the association between HLA Mm and survival.
A single Mm at HLA-B, or -C was associated with a sig-
nificantly lower survival rate compared to that of patients
with 8 matched alleles, whereas a single Mm at HLA-A
or DR was not. Risks associated with single allele vs. single
antigen Mms with regard to OS were not statistically
significant. An increase in the number of HLA Mms was
associated with reduced OS (Fig. 1A). The 3-year survival
rates for patients with 8, 7, and ≤6 matched alleles were
88.4%, 70.7%, and 53.6%, respectively (P=0.006). There was
a significant survival difference between patients with 8
and 7 matched alleles (P=0.015); however, there was no
significant survival difference between patients with 7 and
≤6 matched alleles (P=0.39).
We also evaluated the association between the number
of HLA-Mms and survival in patients with high- or low-risk
hematologic malignancies (Fig. 1B and C). HLA Mms had
a significantly greater effect on the survival of patients with
high- compared to low-risk malignancies (P=0.003). The
adjusted OS hazard ratios for pairs of patients with single
Mms compared to those for high-risk and low-risk patients
with 8 matched alleles were 12.14 (95% CI=1.13-123.62,
P=0.04) and 1.24 (95% CI=0.32-4.86, P=0.76), respectively.
3. Engraftment
In this study, 136 of the 142 patients (95.8%) underwent
successful graft procedures. The median time to neutrophil
engraftment was 14 days (range, 9-35 days). Six patients
(4.2%) showed graft failure; 4 had malignant diseases, and
2 had non-malignant diseases. There was no association be-
tween the numbers of HLA Mms (either allele or antigen)
and engraftment.
4. Acute GVHD
The overall incidences of grade II-IV aGVHD for patients
with 8, 7 and ≤6 matched alleles were 22.0%, 37.5%, and
63.0%, respectively. Additionally, the incidences of grade
III-IV aGVHD in these 3 groups were 6.8%, 23.2%, and
33.2%. An increased number of HLA Mms was associated
with an elevated risk of grade III-IV aGVHD (P=0.003).
No significant difference was observed in aGVHD incidence
between a single high- and a single low-resolution Mm.
Although a single locus Mm was not significantly associated
with grade II-IV aGVHD, the incidence of grade II-IV
aGVHD was significantly higher in recipients with ≥2 Mm
than in recipients with 8 matched alleles (Table 4). Among
pairs with a single locus Mm, only those in whom the Mm
was at HLA-A were at a significantly higher risk of grade

III-IV aGVHD (RR=8.59, 95% CI=1.89-38.88, P=0.005), al-
though a single Mm at locus C generally increased the risk
of grade III-IV aGVHD, with borderline statistical sig-
nificance (RR=3.59, 95% CI=0.93-13.91, P=0.06). Other sig-
nificant non-HLA factors present in the multivariate model
included stem cell source (P=0.05) and conditioning regimen
(P=0.003).
5. Relapse/Relapse-related death
The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse in patients
with malignancies was 21.7±0.3%. There was no association
between the numbers of HLA Mms (either allele or antigen)
and relapse, or between HLA matching status and relapse-re-
lated death. According to multivariate analysis, no non-HLA
factor was associated with relapse.
6. Transplant-related mortality
The 3-year cumulative incidence of TRM is shown in
Fig. 2A. The major cause of TRM was infection. TRM in-
cidence was significantly higher in recipients with a single
Mm at the HLA-B locus than in those with a single Mm
at the other loci, HLA-A, -C, or -DR (33.3 vs. 19.4%, P=
0.007); among 3 patients with HLA-B Mm, 2 died of TRM,
including veno-occlusive disease and infection.
Associations between the number of HLA-Mms and TRM
in patients with high- and low-risk hematologic malignancies
are illustrated in Fig. 2B and C. The number of HLA Mms
had a significantly greater effect on TRM in patients with
high-compared to low-risk disease (P=0.002). Compared
with adjusted hazard ratios of TRM for recipients with 8
matched alleles, the adjusted hazard ratios of TRM for recipi-
ents with ≤6 matched alleles were 51.0 (95% CI=3.89-
669.41, P=0.003) in patients with high-risk disease and 2.55
(95% CI=0.44-14.59, P=0.29) in patients with low-risk
disease. Multivariate analysis identified donor/patient gender
Mm (P=0.04) and conditioning regimen (P=0.02) as sig-
nificant non-HLA factors associated with TRM.
DISCUSSION
Extensive recent research has shown that mismatches at
each HLA locus can affect clinical outcomes of patients un-
dergoing URD HSCT [11-13]. The role of HLA on HSCT
outcomes had not previously been assessed in Korean chil-
dren; thus, we evaluated the effects of patient-donor HLA
compatibility in these children. This is the first multicenter
study to analyze the relative clinical importance of HLA
matching on major transplantation outcomes in Korean chil-
dren. Several important results emerged from our analysis.

First, there were no differences in survival, aGVHD, and
relapse when single allele and single antigen Mms were
compared, in contrast to the common perception that allele
Mms are better tolerated than are antigen Mms. Previous
studies have reported conflicting results, with single allele
and antigen Mms showing either equivalent [4, 5, 9] or
different [14] effects on outcomes. Although particular high-
resolution Mms have been regarded as more permissive than
their low-resolution counterparts, data on pooled high-reso-
lution Mms showed that adverse effects on transplantation
outcomes were detectable [14]. Our results suggest that both
low- and high-resolution Mms should be considered equiv-
alent when determining optimal donor-patient HLA matches.
However, our inability to detect significant differences may
be because the donor-recipient population in this study was
relatively small.
Our results demonstrate the negative effects of a single
Mm on survival. Some Mms exhibit worse transplant out-
comes than other Mms. A recent National Marrow Donor
Program (NMDP) study [14] found that single Mms at
HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DR loci had similar adverse effects
on mortality, and other reports have described a deleterious
effect of HLA-C Mms on survival [3, 14, 15]. In this study,
we found that single Mms at HLA-B and -C, but not at
HLA-A and -DR, were associated with significantly lower
survival rates, compared to those in patients with 8 matched
alleles. These findings agree with the hypothesis that Mms
at some loci are better tolerated than those at the others.
As the strong linkage disequilibrium between HLA-B and
-C results in frequent coordinate matching, information on
both loci is of importance in determining optimal do-
nor-patient HLA matches [16]. Moreover, HLA-A Mms are
associated with a significantly higher risk of grades III-IV
aGVHD. Although reports have yielded different results
when the association between HLA disparity and aGVHD
were compared, our findings confirm that HLA-A Mms have
significant adverse effects on severe aGVHD [14].
An elevated number of HLA Mms also increased the risk
of post-transplantation complications, including poorer over-
all survival, TRM, and aGVHD incidence and severity. In
this study, each additional Mm was associated with a 17-18%
absolute decrease in survival. Most previous studies have
shown that multiple Mms increase mortality and the risk
of post-transplantation complications.
Notably, the impact of HLA Mms differed among patients
at various stages of disease. Some previous studies have re-
ported that high-risk disease before HSCT had a greater
absolute impact on survival than did HLA mismatching [5,
9, 15]. In this study, however, the impact of single HLA
Mms on survival was more detrimental in patients with
high- compared to low-risk malignancies. These differences
may be due to higher incidence of grade III-IV aGVHD
(P=0.05) and the use of a myeloablative conditioning regimen
(P=0.01) in high-risk malignancies compared to those in
low-risk malignancies; differences may also reflect higher
intensities of immunosuppression and the tendency to have
an infection. We also found that TRM rates were proportional
to the extent of HLA mismatching in both the high- and
low-risk disease categories; thus, the greater impact of single
Mms on survival in patients with high- rather than low-risk
disease is likely attributable to augmentation in patients with
higher-risk disease of the negative effect of HLA disparity
associated with TRM. Because the major cause of TRM in
this study was sepsis, early identification and proper treat-
ment of infections is imperative, if HSCT is performed in
a patient with high-risk disease using an incompletely match-
ed donor.
The acceptable Mm level remains controversial. This is
important in donor selection, when a fully matched donor
is not available, and a choice must be made between accepting
a mismatched donor, searching for other sources of stem
cells or a haploidentical donor, and completely avoiding
HSCT. Guidelines of the International Histocompatibility
Working Group (IHWG) state that a full application of the
rules governing the acceptability of HLA Mms should include
side-by-side evaluation of ethnically and racially diverse
transplantation populations (www.ihwg.org). Analysis of
very large numbers of pairs, characterized at high resolution
and for whom complete clinical data are available, is of
crucial importance in addressing locus- and allele-specific
rules for mismatching [17]. The apparent discrepancy be-
tween our results and those of other studies may be attribut-
able to both study power and ethnicity. A discrepancy be-
tween Korean and other patients may reflect disparities in
the HLA and non-HLA genetic backgrounds of the more
homogeneous Korean population compared with more heter-
ogeneous populations. Some HLA alleles and haplotypes are
distributed at different frequencies among various racial/eth-
nic groups [11]. Thus, specific Mms among HLA-loci may
be better tolerated within certain ethnic groups. For example,
a study in Japan suggested that discrepancies of responsible
HLA locus for aGVHD between ethnically diverse HSCT
may be explained by the proportions of nonpermissive Mm
combinations in each HLA locus [18].
Although several studies have found lower relapse risks,
of the graft-vs.-leukemia effect in patients with Mms at mul-
tiple loci or at a specific locus [3, 19], we did not find an
association between HLA disparity and relapse; there may
be an association of donor/patient HLA mismatching with
low rate of discontinuation of immunosuppression and pro-
longed immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD compared to
HLA-matched transplantation. However, as other studies
did not observe an effect of HLA disparity on relapse, further
investigations should be conducted to address this issue [4,
5].
Our present study had several limitations. First, our patient
sample was relatively small and heterogeneous, and trans-
plantation protocols were not uniform. Only 3 patients had
HLA-B Mm; therefore, results should be interpreted with
caution. However, some analyses regarding HLA-B Mm show
a P＜0.05. Second, subset comparisons have specific strengths,
but confounding by Mms at other loci is avoided. Thus,
this method may overlook a functional role of HLA-A, -B,
-C, or -DR mismatching that operates only in combination

HLA matching in URD HSCT 17
with one or more Mms. Membership in groups with double
and triple Mms was too low to permit statistical analysis.
Third, we did not analyze the effect of HLA-DP and -DQ,
which generally showed additive effects when additional
HLA Mms were present at other loci [6, 20].
In summary, we showed that outcomes in single-allele
Mm patients are not equivalent to those in patients with
8/8 matches. Disparity in HLA class I status, regardless of
antigen or allele Mm, had adverse effects on survival and
grade III-IV aGVHD, whereas HLA class II disparities had
little impact on transplantation outcomes. An increased num-
ber of HLA Mms was associated with higher rates of
post-transplantation complications, including poorer surviv-
al and increased aGVHD incidence or severity. HLA dis-
parities impacted survival differently when recipients had
low- or high-risk malignancies. Physicians overseeing HSCT
for high-risk patients using HLA-mismatched donors should
avoid and treat infections and associated complications to
reduce TRM.
This study provides useful information regarding the sig-
nificance of HLA matching on outcomes of Korean pediatric
patients undergoing URD HSCT, thus assisting physicians
in their search for a suitable donor. Further investigations,
including analyses of larger cohorts, are warranted to confirm
the effects of HLA Mms on outcomes of patients undergoing
HSCT.
