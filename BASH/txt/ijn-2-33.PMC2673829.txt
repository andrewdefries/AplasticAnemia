Abstract: Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with
erythropoietin deﬁciency being the major contributing factor. The availability of erythropoiesis-
stimulating agents (ESAs) has been a seminal advance in the treatment of anemia related to
chronic kidney disease. Over the course of the last decade and a half, newer generations of
ESAs have become available. The ﬁrst-generation ESAs or epoetins have a relatively shorter
half-life and have traditionally been administered up to 3 times per week intravenously or
subcutaneously to maintain adequate hemoglobin (Hb) levels. At the turn of the century,
darbepoetin alfa, a hyperglycosylated form, became available for clinical use. It conferred greater
metabolic stability in vivo owing to two additional N-linked carbohydrate chains attached to
the protein backbone and has a half-life 3 times longer than that of epoetin (Macdougall et al
1999). Recently developed and undergoing phase III clinical trials is the third-generation ESA,
Continuous Erythropoiesis Receptor Activator (CERA), which has a methoxy-polyethylene
glycol polymer chain integrated and has a longer elimination half-life than the ﬁrst- and second-
generation ESAs. Its receptor binding characteristics also differ from those of previous ESAs.
Its major advantage is that extended dosing intervals are possible in the management of anemia
related to erythropoietin deﬁciency.
Keywords: CERA, epoetin, anemia, chronic kidney disease
Introduction
Anemia is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and although the cause is usually
multifactorial, it is primarily related to the lack of erythropoietin (EPO) production.
Mortality data from non-randomized studies show an association between anemia and
risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death (Madore et al 1997; Locatelli et al 1998; Ma
et al 1999; Xia et al 1999). However, randomized controlled trials targeting different
hemoglobin (Hb) levels in hemodialysis patients with cardiac disease show conﬂicting
results. Besarab et al (1998), in a study that was prematurely terminated, showed that
in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease, treatment of anemia resulting in higher
targeted Hb led to an increased risk of death. This study was prematurely halted prior
to reaching the pre-speciﬁed statistical stopping boundary. Normalization of Hb levels
in incident hemodialysis patients does not have a beneﬁcial effect on cardiac structure
(Parfrey et al 2005). Recent data suggest an association between high Hb levels and
reduced mortality (Rayner et al 2004; Parfrey et al 2005). Trials in the pre-dialysis
population are not powered to detect such a difference (Pollock and McMahon 2005).
There is emerging evidence to suggest that the adverse effects of anemia are not only
related to Hb levels but also to the low levels of EPO. EPO stimulates the proliferation
and migration of endothelial cells, promotes angiogenesis (Anagnostou et al 1990;
Yamaji et al 1996; Ribatti et al 1999, 2003) and prevents apoptotic injury (Kawakami
et al 2001; Sekiguchi et al 2004). It is becoming evident that the beneﬁts of EPO
treatment may extend above and beyond the treatment of anemia.

Nanomedicines in the treatment of anemia
in renal disease: focus on CERA (Continuous
Erythropoietin Receptor Activator)

Panchapakesan et al
Anemia in renal failure and
traditional treatment options
Prior to the availability of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents
(ESAs), the treatment of anemia related to CKD was limited
to recurrent blood transfusions. Transfusion dependence
was associated with the risks of blood-borne infections, iron
overload, and HLA sensitization, subsequently limiting renal
transplantation opportunities. The development of ESAs has
been a seminal advance in the treatment of anemia. This is
coupled with the use of intravenous iron. The European Best
Practice Guidelines (EBPG) (Locatelli et al 2004) suggest
target Hb levels of >11g/dL within 4 months of starting
therapy. Although there is a lack of consensus surrounding
the desired upper limit of the Hb level due to a lack of
evidence, the EBPG suggest limiting Hb levels to <14g/dL
in hemodialysis patients and to <12g/dL in patients with
severe cardiovascular disease and in patients with diabetes
and peripheral vascular disease. The CARI (Caring for
Australians with Renal Impairment) Guidelines recommend
Hb levels between 12 and 14g/dL in those without proven or
likelysigniﬁcantcardiovasculardiseaseandshouldnotexceed
12g/dL in those with proven or signiﬁcant cardiovascular
disease (Pollock and McMahon 2005). The main concerns
with higher Hb targets include the risk of hypertension and
vascular thrombosis. Iron deﬁciency is common in patients
with CKD and the cause is usually multifactorial. Once ESAs
are commenced there is a rapid depletion of iron stores due to
erythropoiesis. Failure to correct iron deﬁciency commonly
leads to EPO resistance. Iron is usually replaced parenterally
and therapy is individualized based on the results of iron
studies. Sufﬁcient iron should be administered to maintain
a transferrin saturation of >20% and a minimum serum
ferritin of >100μg/L, although the majority would accept that
ferritin should be maintained well above this level. This often
involves ongoing regular doses of intravenous iron.
EPO, a hematopoietic growth factor, was puriﬁed from
the urine of patients with aplastic anemia in 1977 (Miyake
et al 1977), which led to the subsequent cloning of the
human EPO gene in 1985 (Jacobs et al 1985) and the use
of recombinant human EPO (Eschbach et al 1987). It is
a sialoglycoprotein hormone that is immunologically and
biologically indistinguishable from the endogenous form
(Faulds and Sorkin 1989). The ﬁrst ESAs were recombinant
human EPO alpha and beta (epoetins) which differed in their
glycosylation. They were initially administered 2–3 times
per week on the basis of their relatively short biological
half-life (Halstenson et al 1991). However more recently it
is recognized that the dosing interval may be extended to at
least once per week (Barre et al 2004). Darbepoetin alfa, a
second generation ESA, became available at the turn of the
century. Due to its hyperglycosylated structure it has a longer
elimination half-life (Macdougall et al 1999) allowing for an
extended dosing interval. The latest ESA, a third-generation
drug known as CERA (Continuous Erythropoietin Receptor
Activator), has a higher molecular weight at 60kDa and has
a methoxy-polyethylene glycol chain integrated via amide
bonds between the N-terminal amino group of lysine using a
succinimidyl butanoic acid linker (Bailon et al 2003). It has
a signiﬁcantly longer elimination half-life in vivo and allows
for a further extension of dosing intervals.
Mechanism of action and
pharmacokinetics
Receptorbindingcharacteristicsaswellasthepharmacokinetics
of CERA differ quite signiﬁcantly from ﬁrst and second
generation ESAs (Macdougall et al 2003). CERA has a lower
afﬁnity for its receptor and dissociates faster from the soluble
EPO receptor compared with epoetin β, and has a reduced
activity with respect to cellular proliferation in vitro. It is
considered that the binding of CERA to its receptor is too
brief to allow for internalization of the molecule therefore
the repeated binding, stimulation and dissociation leads
to prolonged activity in vivo and an extended elimination
half-life. Pharmacokinetic properties have been studied in
rodent and non-rodent models and the systemic clearance
of CERA has been found to be much lower than that of
epoetin, contributing to an extended elimination half-life and
prolonged stimulation of erythropoiesis (Bailon et al 2003).
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic proﬁle of CERA
in anemic (Hb ≤12g/dL) CKD patients on peritoneal dialysis
have been examined in i.v. and s.c. dosing schedules. These
studies demonstrated prolonged and comparable half-life
for CERA (i.v. or s.c.), suggesting feasibility of extended
dosing intervals in this population (Macdougall et al 2005). In
healthy patients, the pharmacokinetic properties of s.c. CERA
are unaffected by administration site (arm, abdomen, thigh)
(Fishbane et al 2005), allowing for ﬂexibility in the injection
site. An in vitro model showed that there was no effect of
hemodialysis or hemoﬁltration on serum concentrations of
CERA (Dougherty et al 2003).
Efﬁcacy and safety studies
Preclinical studies in vitro
The in vitro erythropoietic activity of CERA has been
assessed by measuring its effect on the proliferation of a
International Journal of Nanomedicine 2007:2(1) 35
CERA in treating anemia of renal disease
human acute myeloid leukaemia cell line (UT-7 cell line)
that expresses the EPO receptor. Compared with epoetin,
CERA stimulated less proliferation of UT-7 cells across a
dose range 0.003–3U/mL. However, in normocythemic mice,
CERA induces greater reticulocytosis compared to epoetin
β (Haselbeck et al 2002). This is possibly attributed to the
binding characteristics and pharmacokinetics as described
above.
Preclinical studies in vivo
Preclinical studies in animal models using intravenous (i.v.)
and subcutaneous (s.c.) CERA, in single and multiple doses,
in the range 0.75–20μg/kg demonstrate CERA to be a more
potent stimulator of erythropoiesis than epoietin with respect
to the magnitude and duration of response (Fishbane et al
2003).
Phase I clinical studies in healthy
volunteers
Phase I studies using single and multiple ascending doses
via intravenous and subcutaneous routes resulted in
dose-dependent increments of reticulocyte counts. In the
randomized single ascending dose studies, healthy subjects
received i.v. CERA in the dose range 0.4–3.2μg/kg or s.c.
CERA in the dose range 0.1–3.2μg/kg vs placebo respectively
(Reigner et al 2003). In the randomized multiple ascending
dose studies, healthy subjects received 3 i.v. doses of CERA
in the dose range 0.4–3.2μg/kg every 3 weeks or 4 s.c. doses
of CERA in the same dose range every fortnightly vs placebo,
respectively. Peak effects in reticulocyte counts were seen at
7 and 10 days after i.v. and s.c. administration respectively.
Repeated dosing had no apparent clinically relevant effect
on pharmacokinetics and accumulation did not occur with 3-
weekly i.v. dosing and was small with fortnightly s.c. dosing.
CERA was generally well tolerated and no serious adverse
events were reported (Dougherty et al 2004).
Phase II clinical studies in anemic
patients
The use of CERA for the treatment of anemia in CKD has
been studied in Phase II clinical trials, both in ESA naïve
dialysis and non-dialysis patients for the correction of anemia
and the maintenance of Hb levels. de Francisco et al (de
Francisco et al 2003) studied the efﬁcacy of s.c. CERA in 61
dialysis patients (≥18 years; Hb 8–11g/dL; on hemodialysis
≥1 month and on peritoneal dialysis ≥2 months). Three dose
levels were tested in sequence, with three dosing intervals in
each sequence. Following a 4-week run-in period, patients
in the ﬁrst sequence were randomized to receive CERA
(0.15μg/kg per week, 0.30μg/kg per 2 weeks, or 0.45μg/kg
per 3 weeks). Patients in the second sequence received
0.3μg/kg per week and those in the third 0.45μg/kg per week.
After 6 weeks, dose adjustments were permitted according to
deﬁned Hb criteria and patients were followed for 12 weeks.
A response was noted in all three dosing intervals and with all
three starting doses. Mean increases in Hb were 0.84, 1.15,
and 1.11g/dL during the ﬁrst 6 weeks of constant dosing
and 1.15, 2.50, and 2.35g/dL during the entire study, in the
low, intermediate, and high dose groups, respectively. Faster
response time was associated with increasing dose with the
median time to response in the low dose group of 52 days,
in the intermediate dose group of 38 days, and in the high
dose group of 30 days. No major adverse effects occurred.
One patient experienced a pruritic rash. Hence this study
showed CERA had a potent erythropoietic activity with a
favorable safety proﬁle. Provenzano et al in the BA16528
study examined the efﬁcacy of subcutaneous CERA in 65
epoetin-naïve non-dialysis patients with CKD. After a 2 week
run-in period, patients were randomized to receive CERA
(0.15μg/kg per week or 0.30μg/kg per week or 0.60μg/kg
per week) once weekly, once every 2 weeks, or once every 3
weeks. Patients were followed for 18 months. Hb increases
occurred in each dose group with mean Hb increases of 0.31,
0.70, and 1.76g/dL during the ﬁrst 6 weeks in the 0.15, 0.30,
and 0.60μg/kg per week groups respectively. The Hb change
from baseline was dose dependent but was independent of
the frequency of administration and was sustained until the
end of the study. The effect on Hb was independent of the
frequency of administration and responses were sustained
until the end of the study (Provenzano et al 2004). This
extended to a long-term Phase II study over a 54-week period
where patients continued to receive their original dose of
s.c. CERA weekly, fortnightly, or once every 3 weeks with
the aim of maintaining Hb levels at 11–12g/dL. During this
study period, mean Hb levels which were measured monthly
were 11.3g/dL with once weekly dosing, 11.4g/dL with
fortnightly dosing, and 11.7g/dL with once every 3 weeks
dosing. CERA was generally well tolerated. Hence CERA
showed sustained and stable control of anemia in non dialysis
patients with CKD.
Phase II studies have also been conducted in anemic
dialysis patients to determine the efficacy of CERA in
maintaining Hb levels (Hb 10–13g/dL). In the ﬁrst study,
patients on 3 times a week i.v. epoietin alfa (dose 80-250IU/
kg per week) were changed to i.v. CERA. Three conversion
International Journal of Nanomedicine 2007:2(1)36
Panchapakesan et al
factors were used to calculate dose, based on the estimated
equi-effective dose of CERA to epoetin: 0.25μg CERA/150
IU epoetin, 0.4/150, and 0.6/150. Once weekly and once
every 2 weeks administration schedules were assessed for
each conversion factor and patients were followed for 19
weeks. The results from the primary efﬁcacy analysis showed
that the 0.6/150 conversion factor was adequate for providing
stable Hb levels in patients treated once a fortnight. These
studies showed that fortnightly i.v. CERA may maintain
stable Hb levels in dialysis patients (Besarab et al 2004).
In the second study by Locatelli et al 137 dialysis patients
previously on s.c. epoetin (1–3x/wk) were randomized to one
of three arms receiving CERA, with the dose administered
estimated to be equivalent to the previous epoetin dose and
data from CERA exposure in healthy volunteers. The median
CERA doses per week in each group were 19μg/kg, 32μg/kg,
and 48μg/kg. Once weekly, once every 3 weeks, and once
every 4 weeks dosing schedules were assessed in each group
and patients were followed for 19 weeks (21 weeks for once
every 4 weeks cohorts) (Locatelli et al 2004). There was a
dose-dependent effect on Hb change from baseline with
mean Hb change of –0.63, –0.10, and 0.48g/dL in each of
the groups from lowest to highest doses respectively. This
dose-ﬁnding study showed that s.c. CERA was effective in
maintaining Hb levels in dialysis patients when administered
every 4 weeks.
Clinical studies in cancer-related anemia
Limited studies to date have been undertaken assessing
CERA in patients with cancer-related anemia. An exploratory
Phase I–II dose escalation study was performed in patients
with multiple myeloma and anemia (Hb ≤11g/dL). CERA
was administered s.c. once every 3 weeks for 6 weeks
with an optional extension to 12 weeks. Initially patients
were randomized to receive doses of 2.0, 3.5, or 5.0μg/kg.
Following review of efﬁcacy and safety data, additional
patients were assigned sequentially to doses of 6.5 and
1.0μg/kg, then 8.0 and 4.2μg/kg. CERA (3.5–8.0μg/kg)
produced a dose-related increase in Hb of 1.6–2.3g/dL. which
resulted in a rapid and sustained Hb increase (Dmoszynska
et al 2004).
Phase III clinical trials
Four Phase III clinical trials for CERA were recently
completed (Roche, data on ﬁle). In these maintenance studies,
dialysis patients on stable maintenance treatment of anemia
with epoietin or darbepoetin were randomized to either
continue their treatment or to change over to CERA every 2
weeks or 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was a change in Hb
concentration between baseline and the evaluation period.
These studies met their primary endpoints and showed that
both routes of administration, ie, s.c. and i.v. at extended
dosing intervals were effective in maintaining Hb levels.
The ﬁrst study was designed to evaluate i.v. CERA (dosed
every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks) for maintenance of Hb in
dialysis patients previously on i.v. epoetin (dosed up to 3
times weekly). The second study was similar to the ﬁrst, but
CERA and epoietin were administered s.c. The third study
was designed to evaluate i.v. CERA (dosed fortnightly) for
maintenance of Hb in dialysis patients previously on i.v.
darbepoetin alfa (dosed once a week or once a fortnight).
The fourth study was designed to evaluate s.c. or i.v.
CERA (dosed once a fortnight) in a pre-ﬁlled syringe in the
maintenance of Hb in dialysis patients previously on epoetin
(dosed up to 3 times weekly). The Phase III correction of
anemia studies in dialysis and non-dialysis patients are
nearing completion.
Safety proﬁle
CERA has been generally well tolerated with no unexpected
safety concerns. In phase II studies in dialysis patients (n=109)
administered i.v. or s.c. CERA for 12 months, the most
common adverse events were hypotension (8.02%), muscle
cramp (4.39%), hypertension (3.05%), headache (2.86%),
and nasopharyngitis (2.10%). The most common serious
adverse events were hypotension (5 events), myocardial
infarction (5 events), cellulitis (4 events) and pancreatitis (4
events). The frequency of the adverse events appeared to be
characteristic of the patient population under study, rather
than being attributable to CERA (Dougherty and Beyer
2005b). In the Phase III trials the common adverse events
in all treatment groups were infections, injuries, procedural
complications, and gastrointestinal disorders. Again these
events were characteristic of the population under study
and not attributable to the study drug. There have been no
reports of pure red cell aplasia with CERA as has occurred
particularly with the ﬁrst-generation ESAs. However, this
remains a potential or theoretical risk. In contrast to the
side-effects reported with the ﬁrst- and second-generation
ESAs, no changes in blood pressure were noted in dialysis
patients after 12 months of treatment with i.v. or s.c. CERA
(Dougherty and Beyer 2005a).
Patient implications
The greatest advantage of CERA over ﬁrst- and second-
generation ESAs is the extended dosing intervals needed
International Journal of Nanomedicine 2007:2(1) 37
CERA in treating anemia of renal disease
to achieve adequate Hb levels for the treatment of anemia
related to CKD and potentially cancer. This has an advantage
not only for health care providers but also for patients,
especially those who self-administer ESAs. For patients
with anemia related to cancers, coinciding chemotherapy and
other parenteral medications provides additional beneﬁts. As
the pharmacodynamics are unaffected by injection sites, this
offers ﬂexibility and convenience to patients, suggesting that
compliance would be increased.
Conclusions
ESAs have revolutionized the treatment of anemia in CKD
and cancers. Although there remains discussion around the
mode of administration and the risk of pure red cell aplasia,
the form of delivery of the ESA (preﬁlled syringe, single- or
multi-use dispensers), difference in discomfort at the injection
site, and so on, the main differentiating factor between the
ESAs relates to their half-life and hence the dosing interval.
First-generation ESAs have a relatively short half-life
resulting in more frequent administration to maintain Hb
levels. Darbepoetin, a second-generation ESA, has a longer
elimination half life (Macdougall et al 2003) both in the
i.v. and s.c. routes of administration. Darbepoetin is widely
used and trials in CKD and dialysis patients have shown that
initial one weekly dose is effective and safe (Macdougall et
al 2003) both in the i.v. and s.c. routes of administration.
Once-weekly darbepoetin alfa is equipotent to thrice-weekly
epoetin (Nissenson et al 2002). Stable patients on once a week
epoetin can be converted to once a fortnight darbepoetin alfa
(Locatelli et al 2003; Brunkhorst et al 2004). Small studies
have shown that monthly administration of darbepoetin was
effective in the treatment of anemia in dialysis and non-
dialysis patients with CKD (Jadoul et al 2004; Ling et al
2005; Theodoridis et al 2005). Hence darbopoetin alfa can
be effectively and safely administered less frequently than
epoetin. It is more potent at longer dosing intervals and at
higher doses (Scott 2002). Initial data from clinical studies
suggest that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
properties of CERA will allow a further increase in the dosing
schedule of CERA. The clinical and economic consequences
remain to be determined in large-scale clinical trials.
