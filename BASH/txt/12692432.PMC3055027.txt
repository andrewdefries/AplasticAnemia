INTRODUCTION
Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) occurs in ap-
proximately 50-60% and is a major cause of morbidity and
mortality of long-term survivors of allogeneic hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (1, 2). Most of clinical manifesta-
tions seen in cGVHD are similar to those in various immune
complex disorders such as collagen vascular diseases with
involvement of oral mucosa and gastrointestinal track, skin
and soft tissue, eye, liver, lung, etc. Although the mecha-
nisms are not well elucidated, the involvement of the kid-
ney and central nervous system seems unusual. Nephrotic
syndrome has been described as one of the clinical forms of
cGVHD, but a limited number of cases with nephrotic syn-
drome after allogeneic HSCT has been described (3-13).
We report a patient with nephrotic syndrome that devel-
oped 22 months after allogeneic HSCT for severe aplastic
anemia with a review of the literature. According to our lit-
erature review, this is the first case of nephropathy after allo-
geneic HSCT in Korea.
CASE REPORT
A 21-yr-old female was admitted to the hospital in Septem-
ber 2001 because of the abrupt development of a nephrotic
syndrome. She was diagnosed as severe aplastic anemia in
April 1998 and received immunosuppressive therapy with
ATG, cyclosporine, and glucocorticoid. Complete remission
was attained after the immnosuppressive therapy, but the
aplastic anemia relapsed after 16 months.
In November 1999, she underwent an allogeneic periph-
eral HSCT from an HLA-identical sibling donor. She received
ATG 90 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg as con-
ditioning regimen and cyclosporine, methotrexate, and glu-
cocorticoid as prophylaxis of GVHD. Engraftment was sus-
tained and there was no acute GVHD. Cyclosporine was
tapered and finally withdrawn after 6 months. After 1 month,
she developed a grade IV cGVHD of gastrointestinal track
with diarrhea and a grade II skin disease with diffuse erythe-
ma requiring the cyclosporine again. After 3 months, the
diarrhea and erythema were subsided and cyclosporine was
gradually tapered off. In February 2001, she never needed
any medications.

Membranous Nephropathy after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell
Transplantation in a Patient with Aplastic Anemia
: A Case Report
Nephrotic syndrome has been described as one of the clinical forms of chronic
graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), but a limited number of cases have been
described. We experienced a young female patient with nephrotic syndrome
developed 22 months after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(HSCT) for severe aplastic anemia. She had been well after successful manage-
ment for gut-limited cGVHD until she developed a clinical nephrotic syndrome
with hypoalbuminemia of 2.0 g/dL and 24-hr urine protein of 6.88 g/dL. On phys-
ical examination and laboratory findings, there was no other evidence of cGVHD.
Clinical and renal biopsy findings were consistent with cGVHD-related membra-
nous nephropathy, and immunosuppressive agents with cyclosporine and pred-
nisone were prescribed. After 3 month of treatment, the proteinuria decreased to
normal range; and the patient from nephrotic syndrome nearly recovered. We
recommend cGVHD-related glomerulonephritis should be considered in all patients
with hypoalbuminemia following allogeneic HSCT, even if there is no other evi-
dence of clinical GVHD.

After 6 months, in August 2001, she developed a clinical
nephrotic syndrome with hypoalbuminemia of 2.0 g/dL and
24-hr urine protein of 6.88 g/dL. She never had renal prob-
lems with routine laboratory findings. On physical exami-
nation, the vital signs were normal and no skin lesion was
observed. Laboratory examination showed normal CBC, CRP,
liver enzymes, renal function, cholesterols, and electrolytes.
Serum immunoglobulin G, A, M and C3, C4 levels were
normal. Urinalysis showed proteinuria and microscopic hema-
turia. Tests for hepatitis B antigen and antibody, hepatitis C,
and antinuclear antibody were all negative.
The renal biopsy contained a total of 12 glomeruli, three
of which were globally sclerotic. The remaining tufts showed
mild thickening of capillary walls. Mesangial cellularity was
not increased. There were patchy foci of tubular atrophy and
striped interstitial fibrosis with a moderately dense mononu-
clear cell infiltrate. Mild arteriolar thickening was present
(Fig. 1). Immunofluorescence study showed diffuse granular
deposits of IgG along the capillary walls. IgA, C1q, C3, IgM,
and fibronogen were negative (rabbit anti-human, FITC,
DAKO). Electron microscopy revealed diffuse thickening of
glomerular basement membranes by epimembranous elec-
tron-dense deposits. These deposits were separated by spike-
like processes or occasionally surrounded by a thin membrane.
The epithelial foot processes were diffusely effaced. There
observed no mesangial deposits (Fig. 2). These clinical and
renal biopsy findings were consistent with chronic GVHD-
related membranous nephropathy, and she was treated with
cyclosporine and prednisone, which has greatly improved
her symptoms and signs related with nephrotic syndrome.
After 3 month of treatment, the proteinuria decreased to nor-
mal range and the nephrotic syndrome nearly recovered.
DISCUSSION
The occurrence of GVHD-related nephropathy after allo-
geneic HSCT is a rare event (14). HSCT-related nephropathy
includes hemolytic uremic syndrome, acute renal failure,
nephrotic syndrome, and chronic renal failure. The main pat-
terns of the early-onset nephropathy after HSCT are known
to be acute renal failure and hemolytic uremic syndrome
related to drugs including cyclosporine or infections. Con-
versely, GVHD-related nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal
failure, and sometimes irradiation-related nephropathy are
the main patterns of the late-onset nephropathy. The most
common type of the late-onset nephropathy after HSCT is
nephrotic syndrome, and the most common pathologic finding
of nephrotic syndrome is membranous nephropathy (12, 13).
But other nonspecific findings, such as mesangiolysis, tubu-
lointerstitial nephritis, and focal segmental glomerulonephritis
have been reported.
It is not uncommon that a late-onset nephropathy simul-
taneously develops with other GVHD symptoms and signs
after insufficient immunosuppression. Therefore the renal
damage seems to be caused by the effects of antibodies induced
by GVHD. Glomerular immune complex formation in chron-
ic GVHD, similar with lupus nephritis, can be caused by
immune complex trapping from the circulation, by binding
of autoantibodies to antigens deposited in the glomerulus,
Fig. 1. Renal biopsy shows mild thickening of the glomerular cap-
illary walls. Mesangial cellularity is not increased (PA-silver stain,
×200).

deposits along the glomerular basement membrane (×11,200).

by direct binding of autoantibodies to intrinsic glomerular
antigens, or by a combination of these mechanisms. The pos-
sible etiologic factors of membranous nephropathy include
infection, autoimmune disorders, cancer, drugs, etc. Ohsawa
et al. (11) reported a glomerular and tubular immune com-
plex deposits in a HSCT recipient and suggested that the
renal deposition of immune complex seemed to be caused by
lodging of circulating immune complex to the glomeruli and
tubules. But the precise mechanisms are still controversial and
direct GVHD-mediated renal injury cannot be completely
excluded. Occasionally de novo cases of nephrotic syndrome
in renal allografts have been found and these suggest that
cellular alloreactivity could induce the membranous nephropa-
thy (15). Experimental data showed that in situ immune com-
plex formation caused by alloreactive T cells could be associ-
ated with the glomerulonephritis (16). Also, Muller et al. (6)
reported that the presence of interstitial CD8 T lympho-
cytes infiltration indicated a GVHD-mediated renal injury.
In our case, glomerular IgG desposits and patchy interstitial
fibrosis with moderate-degree mononuclear cell infiltrates
were observed. And there were no endothelial tubuloreticu-
lar inclusions or mesangial or tubulointerstitial electron-dense
deposits. Cyclosporine has withdrawn for 6 months. These
findings may be encountered in the advanced stages of mem-
branous nephropathy, but also suggest a direct GVHD-medi-
ated renal injury. More interestingly, our case showed only
nephrotic syndrome without other evidence of GVHD-related
symptoms or signs. On our literature review, there are a few
cases with nephrotic syndrome without other evidence of
GNHD-related symptoms or signs (4, 11, 12). Further inves-
tigation on these rare cases may provide valuable insight into
the immunopathogenesis of membranous nephropathy in
allogeneic HSCT recipients.
In conclusion, we recommend cGVHD-related glomeru-
lonephritis should be considered in all patients with hypoal-
buminemia following allogeneic HSCT, even if there is no
evidence of clinical GVHD.
