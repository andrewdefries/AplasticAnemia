Abstract
This is an in-depth review of the history of quinacrine as well as its pharmacokinetic properties and established
record of safety as an FDA-approved drug. The potential uses of quinacrine as an anti-cancer agent are discussed
with particular attention to its actions on nuclear proteins, the arachidonic acid pathway, and multi-drug resistance,
as well as its actions on signaling proteins in the cytoplasm. In particular, quinacrine’s role on the NF-B, p53, and
AKT pathways are summarized.
Nomenclature and chemical grouping
Quinacrine (IUPAC name 4-N-(6-chloro-2-methoxyacri-
din-9-yl)-1-N,1-N-diethylpentane-1,4-diamine) is a het-
erocyclic three-ring compound (Figure 1A), and an
acridine (Figure 1B) derivative (9-aminoacridine). It is
readily available as quinacrine dihydrochloride, the dihy-
drochloride salt of quinacrine, for clinical use. The
interest in quinacrine stems from its long history of
therapeutic uses, as will be discussed in the following
sections, and in particular its potential antineoplastic
activities.
Quinacrine formulations and isomers are known by
numerous designations some of which are: acrichine,
Atabrine®
, atebrine, atebrin, mepacrine, quinacrine dihy-
drochloride, quinacrine dihydrochloride dihydrate,
quinacrine dihyrochloride (R)-isomer, quinacrine dihyr-
ochloride (S)-isomer, quinacrine dimesylate, quinacrine
hydrochloride, quinacrine monoacetate, quinacrine
monohydrochloride, quinacrine monomesylate, quina-
crine (R)-isomer, quinacrine (S)-isomer, and 6-chloro-9-
[[4-(diethylamino)-1 methylbutyl]amino]-2-methoxyacri-
dine. The most commonly used designations for quina-
crine are mepacrine, quinacrine hydrochloride,
quinacrine dihydrochloride, and the registered name
Atabrine®
. Quinacrine is one of several known aminoa-
cridines which include, for example, acridine orange,
acriflavine, aminacrin, amsacrine, ethacridine, nitracrine,
proflavine and tacrine and which have a range of biolo-
gical and therapeutic applications. Table 1 summarizes
some of the key biological and therapeutic applications
of these compounds.
History of quinacrine
Originally developed as pigments and dyes, the pharma-
logical properties of acridine compounds were first
investigated by Ehrlich and Benda in 1912, as antiproto-
zoal agents that act upon trypanosome parasites and
developed further by Carl Browning as antibacterial
agents [1-3]. The use of acridines as antibacterial agents
fell out of favor in the 1940’s after the discovery and
wide spread availability of penicillin to combat bacterial
infections. However, from the 1940’s to the present day
acridines have found wide use as antimalarial agents
with Atabrine®
(quinacrine) being one of the acridine
derivatives successfully used to combat the disease.
Atabrine®
was discovered as part of an intensive antimi-
crobial research program broadly based on biologically
active dyes carried out in 1930’s in the German labora-
tories of I.G. Farbenindustrie. The program covered the
preparation and trial of over 12,000 compounds leading

to the identification of pamaquine and quinacrine as
potential therapeutic agents [4].
Quinacrine was re-discovered in American labora-
tories as “American Atabrine” during the Second World
War when an alternative to quinine was needed for the
treatment of malaria [4]. The outcomes from the use of
quinacrine in the armed forces demonstrated it to be
superior to quinine and made it the official medicine for
the treatment of malaria [5] until 1945 when it was sub-
stituted by chloroquine [6]. Before the substitution, mil-
lions of military personal took Atabrine®
for
prophylaxis. This allowed physicians in the US armed
forces to conduct extensive follow-up studies and pro-
vide health professionals with detailed information on
the side effects and toxicity of quinacrine, making it
among the best studied drugs ever introduced. Three
million soldiers took the drug for up to four years in the
controlled setting of the military service where arguably
compliance and follow up rates are much better than in
a typical study in the civilian population [7-9].
Throughout the years, the use of quinacrine has con-
tinued attaining FDA-approval for the treatment of dis-
eases such as malaria, giardiasis [10-13] and tapeworm
infection [14-16]. Its therapeutic effectiveness has also
been demonstrated in controlled studies in combating
refractory lupus erythematosus [17-22], rheumatoid
arthritis [21,23], and as an adjuvant cancer therapy
[24,25]. In addition, quinacrine has been used as an
intrapleural sclerosing agent to prevent recurrence of
pleural effusion or pneumothorax in patients at high
risk of recurrence, resulting in painless pleurodesis and
remission of fluid and/or air collections [26-30]. Quina-
crine has also been used for regional cancer therapy of
pericardial and abdominal effusions with an ~25-50%
responses rate [31]. Due to its effectiveness as a scleros-
ing agent, quinacrine has also been utilized for contra-
ceptive purposes. It produces an asymptomatic fibrosis
and occlusion of the fallopian canal [32-35]. It should
be noted that for some of these conditions quinacrine
has been superseded by other agents, however the use
of quinacrine has to date not become contraindicated
due to safety concerns. Quinacrine is currently being
clinically tested in the treatment of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease through the National Institute of Aging (NIA)
[ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00183092] and

respiratory stimulant, and in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other central nervous system disorders.
Quinacrine An acridine derivative formerly widely used as an antimalarial but superseded by chloroquine in recent years. It has also been used
as an anthelmintic and in the treatment of giardiasis and malignant effusions as well as a form of contraception/sterilization. It is
used in cell biological experiments as an inhibitor of phospholipase A2.

trial, [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00104663]. In
addition, a trial has recently been completed in the
treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer
through the University of Chicago and Cleveland Biolabs
[ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00417274].
Pharmacokinetics of quinacrine
The typical route of quinacrine administration is orally
with water after a meal [36]. The drug can also be admi-
nistered intralesionally/paralesionally [21,25,37,38], intra-
muscularly, rectally, intravenously [21], transcervically
[34], and interstitially [26-30,39].
It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract
following oral administration [40] with plasma levels
increasing 2-4 hours after administration and reaching a
peak in 8-12 hours [7,21]. Plasma concentration
increases rapidly during the first week and equilibrates
(94%) by the fourth week. Quinacrine is also rapidly
absorbed and distributed after intrapleural, intralesion/
paralesion, and intrauterine administration [41,42]. The
plasma levels of quinacrine remain low in comparison
to tissue concentrations. Peak plasma concentrations of
up to 140 ng/ml (0.32 μM) for quinacrine have been
documented on a standard malaria regimen [8]. It is dis-
tributed throughout the body and its liberation from dif-
ferent tissue compartments is slow. The highest
concentrations are found in the liver, spleen, lungs and
adrenal glands, with liver concentrations reaching
20,000 times that of plasma. The lowest concentrations
of the drug are found in the brain, heart and skeletal
muscle [6,8]. Quinacrine is also heavily deposited in the
skin, fingernails and hair [21]. Spinal fluid concentra-
tions are 1-5% of plasma levels. 80-90% of the drug is
bound to plasma proteins when given at therapeutic
doses and the half life of the drug is five to fourteen
days depending on the dosing regimen [41,43]. Although
small amounts are excreted in bile, sweat, and saliva
[21,40], the major route of quinacrine elimination is via
the renal system which may be enhanced by acidifica-
tion and reduced by alkalinization [6,7].
Reported quinacrine toxicity
Quinacrine has the advantage of a long history of clini-
cal use in the treatment of malaria, so that human toler-
ances are well known. In addition quinacrine has
displayed tissue specificity making its toxicity tolerable
in different therapeutic situations [21,44-46]. The fol-
lowing sections give an overview of the toxicity of qui-
nacrine as it is applicable in the clinical setting.
General toxicity
Mostly minor or reversible adverse reactions include
transient symptoms of mild headache, dizziness, or
gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, anorexia, nausea,
abdominal cramps) which decrease with a reduction in
dosage [21]. These symptoms occur in half of the
patient population receiving 100 mg of quinacrine daily
while almost all patients treated with higher doses
experience some sort of adverse reaction. Some infre-
quent serious side effects of quinacrine have been
reported and will be covered in the following sections.
Gastroenterological and hepatic toxicity
Persistent abdominal cramping or diarrhea has been
reported for patients receiving the drug. These symp-
toms are readily dealt with by co-administration of bis-
muth-containing suspensions or antispasmodic agents.
Long-term high-dose malarial suppressive therapy was
occasionally associated with reversible hepatitis presum-
ably due to quinacrine’s tendency to concentrate in the
liver. Transient lupus associated quinacrine hepatitis
and peritonitis have also been reported, although these
symptoms are attributed to doses three times that of the
recommended dose [47,48].
Ophthalmologic and central nervous system
toxicity
Quinacrine has very low risk of retinal toxicity [49,50].
At doses over 500 mg the drug has the potential to
induce in rare cases a hypersensitivity reaction resulting
in corneal edema, which is reversible [51,52]. Cortical
stimulatory effects of quinacrine were documented in a
study of a group of healthy volunteers given doses of
quinacrine ranging between 200 to 1,200 mg daily for
ten days [53]. At higher doses symptoms may include
restlessness, vertigo, insomnia, nightmares, hyperirrit-
ability, psychosis and convulsions. Although toxic psy-
chosis following quinacrine administration has been
reported [54-56], large scale studies reveal this to be a
rare and quickly reversible event. However it must be
noted that a study of over 7,500 US soldiers given qui-
nacrine (100 mg/day) in World War II revealed a 0.4%
incidence of toxic psychosis [57]. Further investigations
revealed twenty eight (0.1%) CNS-toxic cases among
30,000 treated for malaria [58].
Hematologic toxicity
The most serious potential toxicity of quinacrine is
aplastic anemia. The incidence of aplastic anemia in
World War II soldiers increased after the drugs intro-
duction, but still remained quite low (0.003%) [59].
Reported cases of aplastic anemia have been associated
with patients receiving more than the recommended
daily dose and long treatment periods without having
blood counts checked [60-65]. In considering this toxi-
city it is important to note that the potential lethality of
aplastic anemia is readily preventable due to the early

signs of skin rash. Moreover, hypoplastic anemia can be
identified with frequent routine blood tests [60]. In the
more modern clinical setting 300 mg/day of quinacrine
has been administered and found to be reasonably toler-
ated with no reported incidence of hematologic toxicity
[66].
Dermatologic toxicity
In a study of 120,000 Australian soldiers serving during
the Second World War only 1.6 percent developed
rashes from quinacrine treatment. Eighty percent were
eczematous and twenty percent were lichenoid or exfo-
liative [67]. Lichen planus was observed in 1 of 2,000
soldiers given 100 mg/day and in 1 of 500 given 200
mg/day. The dermatitis quickly resolved upon cessation
of drug administration. Quinacrine can produce a yellow
stain in the skin as well as areas of discoloration appear-
ing like “black and blue marks” or bruises presumably
due to melanin binding [67-69]. Slate-colored pigmenta-
tion of the palate and subungual areas were described in
soldiers treated with quinacrine hydrochloride by Lip-
pard and Kauer [69]. Hyperpigmentation of the oral
mucosa, typically restricted to the hard palate has since
been reported by many others [70]. These marks consist
of membrane bound intracellular granules of quinacrine
that contain large amounts of iron and some sulphur
[67,71-76]. At the doses currently used, approximately
half of the patients receiving the drug develop increased
pigmentation and in half of these patients, an asympto-
matic yellow stain is evident, which is reversible upon
reduction to an average daily dose of <50 mg of the
drug [21].
Carcinogenicity/Tumorigenicity
There have been no studies conducted to investigate the
tumorigenicity of orally administered quinacrine in
humans. The data that exist document the use of quina-
crine in female sterilization. Retrospective analysis
revealed that patients administered with intrauterine
quinacrine had a slight but not statistically significant
increase in the incidence of cancer compared to a con-
trol population. However, the studies concluded that
there was no evidence for an excess risk of cancer devel-
opment [34,77-79].
Conflicting tumorigenicity data have been reported in
short term (up to 30 days) animal studies. Studies in
female mice and rats have shown that quinacrine (at
doses of 30 mg/kg and 22.5 mg/kg, respectively)
enhanced growth of implanted tumor cells and
decreased survival [80,81]. However, other studies in
male mice have shown that quinacrine at doses between
20-25 mg/kg suppress the growth of transplanted
tumors and increase the rate of survival [82-84]. These
inconsistencies may be explained by a recent study that
reveals that dosing schemes in mice that are not equiva-
lent to that used in humans lead to tumor formation
[10]. While tumor formation in mice receiving dosages
that are equivalent to those currently used in the clinic
are equivalent to that of control animals [10].
LD50 established in animal studies
The LD50 of quinacrine hydrochloride for rats is 900
mg/kg by oral administration [85,86]. The LD50 for the
i.p. route for rats has not been estimated, but the
experiments of Keeler and Richardson [87] suggest that
it is approximately 250 mg/kg.
Mechanisms of quinacrine as an anti-cancer agent
Most of the efforts in anti-cancer drug discovery have so
far been focused on identifying drugs which target a sin-
gle protein. Currently there is an increasing recognition
for the need of rationally designed drugs that act on sev-
eral different proteins and pathways [88-90]. Hence
“polypharmacology”, the term used for drugs that bind
to and modulate multiple targets, thereby eliciting sev-
eral clinical effects, is an exciting and developing area of
cancer research [91]. The anti-cancer mechanism of qui-
nacrine is complex, with many potential cellular targets.
This “shotgun” nature of the drug is what may make it
attractive in the treatment of some cancers. The follow-
ing sections describe the different anti-cancer mechan-
isms elicited and signaling pathways modulated by
quinacrine.
Quinacrine intercalates into DNA
DNA is generally considered to be one of the biological
targets for acridine anticancer compounds. There are
three general modes of binding that characterize the
compound interactions with double-stranded DNA:
intercalation, groove binding and covalent binding
[92-94]. Synthetic or natural acridine drugs display vary-
ing chemical and biological properties but they share
the common property of DNA intercalation. This is due
to the presence of an acridine “backbone” that confers a
planar structure to the molecules, allowing them to
intercalate into DNA by stacking between base pairs.
The intercalation of several acridines has been demon-
strated whereby the flat polyaromatic chromophore
inserts between the base pairs of double-helical DNA.
This process is driven by stacking and charge-transfer
interactions between the aromatic systems of the acri-
dine compounds and the DNA bases, resulting in
unwinding of the helix [95,96]. The acridine derivative
quinacrine is no exception, it also binds to DNA by
intercalation [95,97-109]. It should be noted that inter-
calation is not the only type of interaction quinacrine
has with DNA, another involves the diaminobutyl side
chain which interacts with the minor groove of the

DNA and is involved in the stabilization of the double
helix against thermal strand separation [110,111].
Parameters such as fluorescence quantum yield (i.e.
absorption/emission spectra), binding constant, and flex-
ibility in the quinacrine/polynucleotides complexes have
been found to strongly depend on the DNA sequence
[102,112,113]. In general, a clear difference has been found
between the fluorescence quenching of quinacrine when
comparing adenine (A)-thymine (T) rich polynucleotides
to guanine (G)-cytosine (C) containing ones. Fluorescence
emission is enhanced in AT polymers, and a marked
quenching observed in GC polymers [98,100,101,103,
106-108,114]. Fluorescence-assayed preferential binding
studies of quinacrine to DNA reveal that the neighbor
base sequences influence the binding of quinacrine. In
particular the sites where a GC base pair is involved were
found to display high affinities [115]. The high affinity of
quinacrine for DNA via intercalation can be hampered by
denaturation or depurination [114,116].
Acridine interaction with nuclear enzymes -
potential mechanisms for anti-tumor effects
It has been demonstrated that DNA intercalation is
necessary but not sufficient for the antitumor activities
of acridines [109,117,118]. Although the chemothera-
peutic potency of acridines is partly determined by the
strength of DNA binding [117,119-121], the antitumor
properties of acridines are not solely due to their DNA
binding, but also stem from specific interactions with
certain enzymes. Hence the toxicities of acridines are
not largely due to an unspecific toxicity associated with
DNA damage or binding.
Telomerases as acridine targets
The two major classes of enzymes which have been con-
sidered as targets for these intercalating anticancer
drugs are telomerases [122-126] and topoisomerases
[127-131]. Topoisomerases have been well described as
the target of many DNA-binding anti-cancer drugs
while telomerases have more recently been the center of
attention.
Telomerases are not active in normal somatic cells after
birth. However, perhaps as many as 80-90% of cancer
cells have reactivated telomerase [132]. Turning on this
enzyme complex prevents or reverses telomere degrada-
tion and contributes to the growth of a malignant clone
[133]. The inhibition of telomerase in cancer cells leads
to growth arrest and ultimately cell death [132-134].
Acridines have been shown to help form or stabilize
four-stranded intramolecular quadruplex structures (G-
quadruplexes or G-quartets) from the guanine-rich DNA
sequences of telomeres, which inhibit telomerase activity
[123,126]. The formation of G-quadruplexes in telomeric
DNA and the subsequent inhibition of telomerase make
these conformations important as anti-cancer targets,
and the drugs that help to form or stabilize them candi-
dates for chemotherapeutic agents [135,136].
Topoisomerases as acridine targets
Tumor cells are thought to over-express topoisomerase
enzymes to enhance cellular proliferation. As the degree
of topoisomerase poisoning and inhibition is a function
of the amount of the enzyme present, this mechanism
provides a potentially selective mode for killing of
tumor cells [130,137]. By inhibiting the re-ligation activ-
ity of topoisomerase enzymes, acridines convert topoi-
somerases into DNA damaging agents leading to cellular
toxicity and death [117,127-131].
Quinacrine and telomerases
The mechanism of action of quinacrine on telomerase
activity is not well described. Dominick et al. found that
purified E. aediculatus, T. thermophila, and human telo-
merase was inhibited by quinacrine [138]. The banding
patterns of the telomerase products generated in the
presence of quinacrine were, however, not consistent
with typical quadruplex stabilizing compounds which
tend to cause enrichment of products associated with
four repeats of the telomeric sequence [138,139]. Hence
the exact process of quinacrine-induced inhibition of
telomerase remains unclear. It should be noted that a 50
μM concentration of quinacrine was used to achieve tel-
omerase inhibition, a dose well above the concentration
needed to see the cytotoxic effects of quinacrine.
Quinacrine and topoisomerase
Quinacrine is suggested to be a topoisomerase inhibitor
as it displays intercalative activity and structural similar-
ity to other acridines. Furthermore, quinacrine, like
topoisomerase poisons, inhibits DNA repair [140-142].
It also inhibits excision repair processes in E. coli
[143,144] and in human fibroblasts exposed to ultravio-
let light [142,145-147]. In addition, quinacrine also sen-
sitizes cultured HA1 cells (a sub-line of Chinese
hamster ovary cells) to killing by X-rays and it prevents
the repair of single strand breaks [148]. It has further
been shown to sensitize cells when applied at the time
of irradiation or shortly beforehand and to prevent the
enzymatic rejoining of single strand breaks [148]. Hence
it has been postulated that the observed radiosensitiza-
tion is attributable to its capacity to inhibit such repair
processes, in which topoisomerases are implicated
[141,142,147,149]. It has also been hypothesized
[142,146,147] that densely packed chromatin structures
must be transiently loosened by topoisomerase to render
the DNA damage sites accessible to excision repair
enzymes, particularly for access of repair endonuleases
that excise the damaged site [150-152].

It must be noted that the majority of reports which
suggest that quinacrine is a topoisomerase inhibitor do
not provide direct experimental evidence supporting the
topoisomerase inhibitory activity of quinacrine. In one
set of studies the effect of quinacrine on topoisomerase
is assumed from experiments where quinacrine inhibits
UV-induced DNA repair with a Kd of 38.1 μM for
reparative DNA synthesis [142] and 781 μM for inhibi-
tion of DNA incision [146]. Hence in many studies the
effect of quinacrine on topoisomerase is assumed to be
due to the effect on DNA repair and when quinacrine is
shown to inhibit this nuclear enzyme, the concentration
required to induce this effect is quite high.
Although relatively few research reports exist that
study the direct role of quinacrine in topoisomerase
inhibition, a recent report revealed a lack of detectable
topoisomerase interaction for quinacrine at doses up to
11 μM [109]. In another study, an indirect measure of
topoisomerase activity, the P4 DNA unknotting assay,
revealed that a concentration of 50 μM quinacrine was
required to inhibit topoisomerase II P4 unknotting
activity. However, in the same study the lowest IC50 for
growth inhibition was attained in a cell line where drug
resistance should have been encountered if the mechan-
ism of action was due to topoisomerase inhibition [153].
Also in the same investigation, no DNA breakage and
no DNA-protein binding was observed at lower doses of
quinacrine which were observed to have an inhibitory
effect on in vitro growth [153]. The notion that rela-
tively high amounts of quinacrine are needed to inter-
fere topoisomerase was shown by dose-dependent
inhibition of topoisomerase enzyme activity, with 30-
40% inhibition at 20 μM and 80-90% inhibition at 100
μM [141]. In addition, the high (>700 μM) concentra-
tion of quinacrine needed to induce DNA incision
observed by Thielmann et al. [146] hints that enzymes
involved in DNA repolymerization and not topoisome-
rase may be involved. Taken together these finding
indeed support the role of other nuclear enzymes in the
anti-tumor effect observed by quinacrine. From the
body of evidence in the literature it is valid to assume
that the stifled DNA repair observed with quinacrine is
mediated by the inhibition of other enzymes, for
instance repair-specific UV endonucleases, DNA heli-
cases [154], or DNA polymerases [147], but not topoi-
somerases. One can also assume that at lower doses the
effect of quinacrine may not be attributed to its interac-
tion with the DNA and inhibition of nuclear enzymes as
detailed further in later section of this review.
Quinacrine effects on DNA and RNA polymerases
The literature describing the mechanism of quinacrine’s
anti-tumor effect suggests that two candidate families of
nuclear enzymes, DNA polymerase and to a less extent
RNA polymerase, may be involved in the mechanism of
quinacrine’s radiosensitizing ability. Effective nucleotide
excision repair requires DNA gaps be filled by reparative
DNA synthesis. In principle, all DNA polymerases found
in the nucleus may play a role in this gap-filling. The
effects of quinacrine on DNA and RNA polymerase
reactions in vitro shed light on how quinacrine may
inhibit enzymatic polymerization reactions in vivo and
induce anti-tumor effects.
Early experiments have hinted at a mechanism of qui-
nacrine preventing the action of DNA and RNA poly-
merase [155,156]. van Dyke et al. [155] demonstrated
that quinacrine inhibits the incorporation of tritiated
adenosine triphosphate primarily into RNA and DNA of
the erythrocyte-free malaria parasite. In Tetrahymena,
32 μM quinacrine inhibits the synthesis of DNA (almost
completely), RNA (70%), and protein (50%), and almost
completely blocks the incorporation of labeled acetate
into lipid components [156]. Evidence of quinacrine
inhibition of DNA and RNA polymerase has also been
obtained in E. coli K12, with RNA polymerase inhibition
being less sensitive than DNA polymerase to quinacrine
inhibition [110,111]. A Kd in excess of 10 μM is
reported by O’Brien et al. [110] and Hahn et al. [111].
More recent work revealed that when normal rat liver
and Novikoff hepatoma DNA polymerases a, δ, and ε
were treated with a dose range of 0.1 μM to 200 μM
quinacrine, the drug preferentially inhibited the DNA
polymerases from the malignant cells [157]. The IC50
values of quinacrine inhibition were 15.2 μM, 22.6 μM,
and 11.4 μM for DNA polymerase a, δ, and ε, respec-
tively, that were isolated from hepatoma, compared to
that of 92.5, 200, and 146 μM for DNA polymerase a, δ,
and ε isolated from normal rat liver [157]. The observed
differences in DNA polymerase inhibition most likely
reflects differences in the weakening effect on DNA-pro-
tein interactions [157], which in turn suggest a specific
change in the DNA-binding domains of the individual
polymerase enzymes. This hypothesis has been sup-
ported by the discovery of sequence changes of these
DNA-binding domains for human and yeast DNA poly-
merases [158,159].
It should be noted that inhibition of DNA poly-
merases in other experiments is achieved at much
higher concentrations of quinacrine. Inhibition of Hepa-
titis B virus DNA polymerase by quinacrine was only
achieved at over 700 μM [160]. This agrees with the
results of Thielmann et al. [146] where approximately
the same concentration of quinacrine was needed to
induce DNA incision in human fibroblasts. It should
also be noted that using a different system to analyze
the inhibitory effect of quinacrine on Hepatitis B virus
DNA polymerase Hess et al. [161] found quinacrine
only to be effective in the 20 to 50 mM range. Hence

the cytotoxicity and anti-tumor effect of quinacrine
achieved at lower dose well below those needed to gen-
erally inhibit polymerase activity must be attributed to
other cellular mechanisms.
Interaction with and inhibition of proteins
involved in multidrug resistance
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle to the
effective treatment of cancer, as MDR proteins aid in the
active transport of a broad range of anticancer drugs out
of the cancer cells. This export is ATP-dependent, allow-
ing efflux against concentration gradients. An important
set of proteins involved in this export is the ATP-binding
cassette transporter family, which includes P-glycopro-
tein (P-gp). P-gp is encoded by the MDR1 gene and its
overexpression is one of the major underlying mechan-
isms of MDR. The upregulation of P-gp in cancer cells
has made it an attractive therapeutic target for combating
MDR. One hypothesis supposes that P-gp allows cells to
achieve MDR by actively pumping the chemotherapeutic
agent out of the cells, thereby reducing the toxic effect
[162,163]. The interaction of acridine-based chemothera-
peutics with P-gp thus inhibits not only their own efflux
but may also the efflux of co-administered chemothera-
peutics, as well as increasing uptake into cells [164-168].
The interaction of acridine derivatives with proteins
involved in MDR is not related to their DNA intercala-
tion capabilities and appears to be an exciting new strat-
egy for chemotherapy [162,167,169].
Quinacrine is implicated in the reversal of the MDR
phenotype from several studies. It has been shown to
reverse drug resistance to vincristine in a MDR sub-
clone of K562 cells (a human chronic myelogenous leu-
kemia cell line) starting at 5 μM [170]. Furthermore, it
has been demonstrated to induce cytotoxicity, but the
exact mechanism of cell death was not investigated
[170]. The effect of quinacrine in reversing the MDR
phenotype in leukemia cell lines in vitro was also sup-
ported by other investigators who used approximately 6
μM of quinacrine to increase cellular uptake of vincris-
tine. They observed a cytotoxic effect with approxi-
mately 1aμM of quinacrine treatment, reducing cell
growth by 82% when used alone, and almost completely
inhibiting growth when combined with vincristine [171].
These same investigators then went on to conduct in
vivo experiments showing the reversal of vincristine
resistance with addition of 50 or 80 mg/kg/day of quina-
crine [171].
The only direct test of the role of quinacrine as an
inhibitor of P-gp has been conducted by using a multi-
drug resistant human T-cell leukemic cell line which
expresses P-gp as a doublet that can be photaffinitty
labeled by the analog of vinblastine, N(p-azido-[3-125
I]
salicyl)-N’-b- amlnoethylvindesine ([125
I]NASV) [172].
[125
I]NASV specifically binds to P-gp and the inhibition
of its binding was used as a read out for the affinity of
quinacrine for P-gp. In this study the binding affinity of
quinacrine to P-gp was correlated to its ability to
increase vinblastine sensitivity. It is, however, note-
worthy that, although in an earlier investigation pub-
lished by the same authors quinacrine increased the
toxicity of vinblastine (12-fold) and vincristine (15-fold)
at 5 μM and had an IC50 of 14 μM when administered
alone [173], in this subsequent study a 50 μM dose only
partially reduced [125
I]NASV labeled P-gp [172].
The study of quinacrine’s role in MDR has not been
limited to leukemia but it has also been analyzed in
MDR cells from the ovary and prostate cancer. Quina-
crine was reported to affect MDR Chinese hamster
ovary (CHO) cells at 6 μM in studies measuring the
uptake of labeled palmitoyl carnitine and palmitoyl lyso-
phosphatidyicholine. They were more rapidly taken up
by the MDR cells and this uptake was reversed after
quinacrine treatment back to the rates observed with
the parental cell line, hence implicating quinacrine in
reversing the MDR [174]. It also enhanced the activity
of paclitaxel in hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells
both in vitro and in vivo [175]. Quinacrine itself dis-
played IC50 values of 3.1 μM for PC-3, of 4.7 μM for
PC-3M (a MDR sub-clone of the cell line) and of 3.5
μM for DU145 cells. Combination therapy of quinacrine
and paclitaxel were determined to be synergistic in both,
in vitro and in vivo (mouse xenografts) experiments.
The exact mechanism of this synergistic effect was not
studied however, the authors attributed to quinacrine’s
effect on phospholipase A2 (PLA2)[175].
Disruption of the arachidonic acid pathway
Manipulations of the arachidonic acid pathway (Figure
2) have received considerable attention in the chemo-
prevention of cancer [176-180]. Agents which inhibit
this pathway have been demonstrated to hold promise
in the chemoprevention of prostate, gastrointestinal,
lung as well as esophageal cancer [177,181-184].
Although cyclooxygenase has been the focus of many
anti-neoplastic agents targeting the arachidonic acid
pathway [185], other components of the pathway could
potentially also be promising targets. One such putative
target, PLA2, hydrolyzes the sn-2-acyl bond of mem-
brane phospholipids to produce arachidonic acid (Figure
2), which has been implicated in a variety of signal
transduction events, including those regulating malig-
nant cell proliferation [186,187]. Histological studies
suggest that membrane phospholipase A2 expression
levels are associated with tumor aggressiveness in gastric
[188] and breast cancers [189].
Disruption of the arachidonic acid pathway by quina-
crine via inhibition of PLA2, leads to a wide array of

effects. The inhibition of PLA2 [190-193] occurs via qui-
nacrine’s binding to membrane phospholipids (primarily
phosphatidylethanolamine), and subsequent intercalation
into the membrane [194-198] and inhibition of PLA2
membrane binding and activity [190-193,199]. The
decrease in arachidonic acid due to PLA2 inhibition
[199] in turn results in the inhibition of leukotrienes
(LOX activity) and prostanoids (COX activity), as well
as eicosanoids (MOX/CYP450 activity) [193,194,
200-210]. This is of interest since recent reports
implicate an enhanced activity of arachidonic acid path-
way proteins in preventing apoptosis and promoting
tumor progression in head and neck cancer [211-222].
In platelets, the conversion of arachidonic acid to
thromboxane is suppressed by quinacrine [21,206,
210,223]. Thromboxane is a major factor in blocking the
release of arachidonic acid from cellular phospholipases.
In addition, thromboxane is involved in angiogenesis
and the development of tumor metastasis [224-226].
Quinacrine also decreases prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)

production in a dose-dependent manner. Prostaglandin,
PGE2 and the COX2-PGE2 pathway/arachidonic acid
pathway play an important role in the induction of the
pro-inflammatory response and ultimately tumorigenesis
[227-229]. PGE2 levels have been implicated in angio-
genesis, tumor growth and invasion, apoptosis resistance
and suppression of anti-tumor immunity via suppression
of T and NK cells, and amplifying Treg [227,230-232].
The upregulation and pro-oncogenic actions of PGE2
have been demonstrated in head and neck cancer
[222,233-237].
Quinacrine as an inducer of p53 and inhibitor of
the NF-B and AKT pathways
The deleterious roles of p53 inactivation [238,239] and
nuclear factor-kB (NF-B) hyperactivation [240,241] have
been well established in human cancers. They lead to
inhibition of cell death and promotion of oncogenesis.
Cross talk between these two pathways has been identi-
fied and studied (Figure 3). It has been reported that p53
and NF-B repress each other’s activity by competing for
transcriptional proteins such as p300 and CREB-binding
protein (CBP) [242]. One signaling protein known to
influence this competition is IKKa [243,244]. In particu-
lar, IKKa has been implicated in phosphorylating and
directing CBP to participate in either the p53 or NF-B
pathway [243,244]. Another well studied signaling pro-
tein, AKT, can both activate IKKs as well as
phosphorylate and enhance the transcriptional activity of
p65 (NF-B complex protein) [245-247]. In addition it
has been demonstrated that AKT-mediated phosphoryla-
tion of MDM2 inhibits p53 stabilization [248]. Hence, it
is likely that inhibitors of AKT activation could be uti-
lized as anti-cancer agents for the inactivation of p53 and
the inhibition NF-B signaling.
Besides the development of AKT inhibitors, there has
been no concerted effort to rationally design drugs that
can simultaneously activate p53 and inhibit NF-B. The
opposing nature of these pathways suggests that a drug
which activates p53 and simultaneously inhibits NF-B
would have significant clinical potential due to the fact
that it is concomitantly modulating two critical cancer
targets. In addition, a drug capable of affecting both of
these pathways would also be a useful tool to study the
interactions between the opposing p53 and NF-B path-
ways. The literature [249] and further unpublished work
from members of the Tumor Biology Group of NIDCD
at NIH point to quinacrine as being such a drug (Van-
Waes et al., unpublished data).
Quinacrine and p53
Several recent investigations support the notion that
quinacrine-induced cell death is caused by a mechanism
that is independent of DNA damage [250-252]. Quina-
crine has been demonstrated to stabilize p53 in a man-
ner that differs from that of DNA-damage induced p53
stabilization [250,251]. Wang et al. have reported the
ability of quinacrine and other acridine derivatives to
activate wild-type p53 transcription in ovarian cancer,
non-small cell-lung carcinoma and colon adenocarci-
noma cell lines, independent of DNA damage and
MDM2 [251]. This DNA damage- and MDM2-indepen-
dent effect of quinacrine in activating wild-type p53 in a
diverse set of cell lines was supported by Gurova et al.
when they found that quinacrine activates p53 in renal
cell carcinomas, non-small cell lung carcinoma, colon
and breast carcinomas, prostate adenocarcinomas, and
fibrosarcomas [250]. Friedman et al. extended these
findings to reveal that quinacrine activates p53 in several
different head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell
lines with wild-type p53 [249]. The cell death induced
after quinacrine treatment was not only p53 dependent
[250], but also involved Bcl-2-associated X protein
(BAX) [251], thereby indicating an important role of the
mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. This suggests that
other signaling proteins may also be involved in the cell
death induction by quinacrine. The mechanism of p53
activation by quinacrine and its ability to modulate
other signaling proteins may minimize the toxic side
effects seen with treatments using DNA-binding plati-
num agents, making it potentially a desirable anticancer
agent.
Figure 3 Cross talk between NF-B and p53. There are many
lines of crosstalk between the p53 and NF-B pathways. A few of
these are highlighted, such as AKT and the transcriptional co-
activator proteins CREB-binding protein (CBP) and the related p300
protein. AKT can activate both IB kinases (IKKs) and phosphorylate
p65. AKT-mediated MDM2 phosphorylation can also inhibit p53
stabilization. Due to competition for the limited pool of CBP/p300,
this protein also plays a crucial role in determining which pathway
dominates in terms of cellular outcome. In addition, NF-B has
been shown to directly upregulate the levels of MDM2 mRNA and
hence the protein. One promising aspect of quinacrine is its
simultaneous ability to inhibit AKT, to induce the p53 pathway, and
to inhibit the NF-B pathway. Adapted from Dey et al. [279].

Quinacrine and NF-B
The unique mechanism of p53 upregulation which dif-
fers from the genotoxic upregulation of p53 was not
investigated by Wang et al. [251], but Gurova et al.
[250], found the induction of p53 to be linked to the
inhibition of NF-B. These results were later extended
using a skin inflammation mouse model where the con-
tact hypersensitivity (CHS) response to chemical aller-
gen sensitization was evaluated [253]. In this mouse
model the authors identified NF-B to be critical in the
development of the contact hypersensitivity response
and demonstrated that quinacrine reduced CHS by inhi-
biting NF-B activation and as well as cytokines (TNFa,
IL-1b, and CCL21) that are dependent on NF-B activa-
tion [253].
NF-B is also a key regulator of cytokine-induced
expression of endothelial cellular adhesion molecules
(CAMs) [254,255]. The inhibitory effect of quinacrine
on NF-B in this context was supported in experiments
where NiCl2- and CoCl2-induced cellular activation of
ICAM-1 was inhibited by quinacrine [256]. The effect
was attributed to PLA2 because the enzyme causes the
generation of platelet activation factor and eicosanoids
[257], which are thought to play a role in the activation
of NF-B [256].
NF-B has been recently shown to also depend on
arachidonic acid metabolites [258] and upstream inhibi-
tion by quinacrine has been proposed to inhibit the acti-
vation of NF-B due to its inhibitory effects on PLA2
[259]. In a study evaluating the effect of lysophosphati-
dic acid (LPA) on endothelial cell activation, quinacrine
blocked LPA-stimulated activation of NF-B as well as
the increase in expression of genes known to be depen-
dent on the activation of the NF-B transcription factor:
E-selectin, ICAM-1, IL-8, and MCP-1 [260].
Another interesting line of investigation further
revealed that reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) are
implicated in UVB-induced expression of TNFa in kera-
tinocytes and that COX products and, more importantly,
LOX products, also known as eicosanoids, which are
themselves products of an oxidative metabolism, are the
main ROI implicated in this induction [261]. The investi-
gators hypothesize that eicosanoids likely exert their
function through activation of NF-B [261]. They also
attributed the reduction of TNFa mRNA after quinacrine
administration to the inhibitory activity of quinacrine on
PLA2, based on reports showing that UVB can induce
PLA2 in keratinocytes [262-264]. Another study investi-
gating the source of oxygen radicals which activate Kupf-
fer cell NF-B after co-culture with AH70 cells attributed
the attenuation of oxidative NF-B activation to the
PLA2 inhibitory activity of quinacrine [265].
However, because many studies do not directly impli-
cate PLA2 inhibition by quinacrine as the mechanism of
NF-B inhibition and in light of more recent investiga-
tions challenging the notion that quinacrine acts primar-
ily as an inhibitor of PLA2 [200,253,266], quinacrine’s
effect is presumably, at least partially, due to NF-B
inactivation via a mechanism other than PLA2 inhibi-
tion. Pupe et al. [261] present another intriguing
mechanism for NF-B inactivation as their experiments
revealed quinacrine to inhibit UVB-induced IBa degra-
dation. However, this type of inhibition may be tumor-
specific since another mechanism of NF-B inhibition,
nuclear translocation and sequestration of an inactive
complex, has been well documented.
Unlike other NF-B inhibitors, quinacrine does not
inhibit the NF-B pathway via cytoplasmic sequestration
of p65. Instead, published experiments indicate a
mechanism involving confinement of the p65 complex
in the nucleus in an inactive state [250]. The increased
presence of NF-B in the nucleus after quinacrine expo-
sure was supported by experiments revealing increased
DNA binding of NF-B after quinacrine treatment alone
or in combination with TNFa [267]. These experiments
also revealed that quinacrine plus TNFa induced greater
NF-B DNA binding than TNFa treatment alone. The
lack of DNA binding inhibition of NF-B after quina-
crine treatment was also confirmed in a report by Fabbri
et al. [268].
Down-regulation of p65 Ser536 phosphorylation by
IKKa has been suggested as the primary mechanism of
action for quinacrine [250]. The physiological impor-
tance of this inhibition was recently confirmed in the
skin inflammation mouse model described in a previous
section [253]. Further support of this mechanism was
attained by Na et al. when hydrogen peroxide-induced
phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-B was par-
tially inhibited by quinacrine [269]. The effects of quina-
crine on NF-B are in line with its uses in the
treatment of inflammatory diseases as a single agent or
in combination with other medications [21]. As dis-
cussed further below, first hints of the mechanism by
which quinacrine may inhibit the NF-B pathway and
promote the p53 pathway have come from studies with
9-aminoacridine (9AA), which implicated AKT and
mTOR as targets for quinacrine [270].
Quinacrine and AKT
As shown in Figure 3, AKT is involved in the NF-B
and p53 signaling pathways [245,271,272]. AKT phos-
phorylates the p65 subunit of NF-B at Ser536, ulti-
mately stimulating NF-B transcriptional activity
[272,273]. In addition, AKT phosphorylates MDM2 on
Ser166 [271]. AKT phosphorylation of MDM2 induces
translocation of MDM2 into the nucleus and targets
p53 for destruction [271]. Phosphorylated MDM2 also
transports p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where
Ehsanian et al. Cell Communication and Signaling 2011, 9:13
http://www.biosignaling.com/content/9/1/13

it is involved in the induction of p53 degradation
through the proteasome. Therefore, AKT is a critical
signaling protein involved in the suppression of p53
activity. This hypothesis has been supported by experi-
ments demonstrating a correlation between AKT kinase
activity and inhibition of p53 [272].
Guo et al. demonstrated that 9AA inhibits AKT activ-
ity and its phosphorylation at Ser473 [270]. They went
on to show that this inhibition was not a direct effect of
reduced PI3K activity and implicated mTOR in this
inhibition. Hence, it seems that acridines like quinacrine
may be involved in stopping a positive feedback loop
between AKT and mTOR [270]. The inhibition of AKT
activity by 9AA has also been confirmed by other inves-
tigators in a model of human T-cell leukemia virus-
transformed cells [274]. Furthermore, in a study of the
role of arachidonic acid metabolism and epidermal
growth factor (EGF) receptor in neurotensin-induced
prostate cancer cell growth, quinacrine’s activity as an
inhibitor of AKT was reaffirmed. These experiments
revealed quinacrine to inhibit neurotensin-, and to a les-
ser degree EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT
[275].
The multiple actions of quinacrine and its
established history of safety make it an attractive
anti-neoplastic chemotherapeutic agent
Since its discovery as a potent antimalarial compound,
quinacrine has been effective not only in the treatment,
but also as a prophylaxis for malaria as well as a medi-
cation for a wide range of other disorders. Due to its
anti-inflammatory activity in patients with autoimmune
disorders quinacrine has been used to treat lupus
erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, bronchial asthma
and other inflammatory diseases. The safety of and bioa-
vailability of quinacrine has been demonstrated as
patients with these diseases used quinacrine for months
at a time to control their symptoms. The pharmacoki-
netics and safety of quinacrine has been extensively stu-
died as it was administered as a protective measure to
millions of US soldiers in the Pacific region during
World War II.
Some of the more serious side effects of quinacrine
are mild in comparison to other anti-cancer chemother-
apeutics and most of the conditions can be easily
reversed after treatment cessation or dose reduction.
Many of quinacrine’s side effects develop gradually,
starting from minor lesions in the case dermatitis or a
slight decrease in blood counts in the development of
anemia, and have been found to be completely and
easily reversible, if quinacrine use is discontinued at this
early stage [21,49,64,276]. Indeed some of the side
effects exhibited due to quinacrine treatment can be
used in the clinical setting to confirm proper dosing of
the drug in the treatment of cancer patients. The yellow
discoloration of the skin due to the accumulation of the
bright yellow compound would indicate to the clinician
that the drug has reached the equilibrium and as in the
case of squamous cell carcinomas, has potentially
reached areas where tumor has developed.
Furthermore, the polypharmacology of quinacrine
make it an attractive drug in the use of different cancer
types. In addition, as inflammation is now being consid-
ered the seventh hallmark of cancer [277], quinacrine’s
anti-inflammatory effects would seem to increase its
potential utility as a anti-cancer drug. As more research
is being conducted into quinacrine’s mechanisms of
action, investigators have begun to realize that its inter-
actions extend beyond mere DNA binding and effects
on nuclear proteins. Quinacrine has thus been shown to
bind and inhibit proteins involved in multidrug resis-
tance, to disrupt the arachidonic acid pathway, as well
as affecting the p53, NF-B and AKT pathway. Its
effects on multiple key signaling pathways, implicated in
the malignant progression of numerous cancer types,
make quinacrine an exciting candidate as a chemothera-
peutic agent in new types of combination treatments.
Continued research into the mechanisms of this drug is
clearly warranted as it may be used in addition to estab-
lished therapeutic regimes in hopes of ultimately redu-
cing toxic side effects of drugs, such as DNA damaging
agents, currently used in the clinic.
