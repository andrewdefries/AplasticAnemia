Abstract
The genetic factors that underlie the increasing incidence of diabetes with age are poorly understood. We examined
whether telomere length, which is inherited and known to shorten with age, plays a role in the age-dependent increased
incidence of diabetes. We show that in mice with short telomeres, insulin secretion is impaired and leads to glucose
intolerance despite the presence of an intact b-cell mass. In ex vivo studies, short telomeres induced cell-autonomous
defects in b-cells including reduced mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization and Ca2+
influx which limited insulin
release. To examine the mechanism, we looked for evidence of apoptosis but found no baseline increase in b-cells with
short telomeres. However, there was evidence of all the hallmarks of senescence including slower proliferation of b-cells and
accumulation of p16INK4a
. Specifically, we identified gene expression changes in pathways which are essential for Ca2+
-
mediated exocytosis. We also show that telomere length is additive to the damaging effect of endoplasmic reticulum stress
which occurs in the late stages of type 2 diabetes. This additive effect manifests as more severe hyperglycemia in Akita mice
with short telomeres which had a profound loss of b-cell mass and increased b-cell apoptosis. Our data indicate that short
telomeres can affect b-cell metabolism even in the presence of intact b-cell number, thus identifying a novel mechanism of
telomere-mediated disease. They implicate telomere length as a determinant of b-cell function and diabetes pathogenesis.

Introduction
The incidence of type 2 diabetes increases with age and one in
five individuals are affected by the age of 60 [1]. The natural
history of type 2 diabetes is progressive. In its early stages, type 2
diabetes manifests as impaired glucose tolerance and defective
insulin secretion which occur in the presence of an intact b-cell
mass [2]. This is followed by a frank loss of b-cells and a
concomitant need for insulin therapy [2,3,4]. Recent genomic
studies have underscored the influence of inherited factors that
affect b-cell integrity and function in age-related diabetes [5,6,7,8].
While these germline factors are hypothesized to play a role in the
pathogenesis of diabetes, the biology that underlies their increasing
penetrance with age is not understood.
Telomeres shorten progressively with cell division, and short
telomeres activate a DNA damage response that leads to apoptosis
and senescence [9,10]. Telomerase synthesizes new telomere
repeats onto chromosome ends to offset in part this telomere
shortening [11,12]. Mutations in TERT, the telomerase reverse
transcriptase, and TR, the telomerase RNA, cause telomere
shortening and a degenerative organ failure syndrome that
manifests prominently in tissues of rapid turnover: the skin,
mucosa and bone marrow [13,14]. This disease complex is often
recognized in dyskeratosis congenita (DC), a premature aging
syndrome defined by classic mucocutaneous features [15]. In DC
and related disorders, short telomeres cause stem cell loss and
progressive organ dysfunction which leads to premature mortality
due to bone marrow failure and pulmonary fibrosis (reviewed in
[15]). Even when the telomerase locus is wild-type, short telomeres
are sufficient to cause age-associated degenerative disease similar
to the DC phenotype [16,17]. This observation has pointed to
short telomere length as the relevant lesion in the setting of mutant
telomerase genes, and more commonly, because telomere length is
polymorphic, as an important genetic determinant of age-related
disease [17].
Because b-cell function declines with age, we hypothesized that
short telomeres might contribute to b-cell failure and to the
increasing incidence of diabetes with age. We show, in a
genetically defined model, that short telomeres are sufficient to
impair glucose homeostasis. Mice with short telomeres have
defects in insulin release. In ex vivo studies, we show short telomeres
limit insulin exocytosis because of signaling defects. These include

impaired mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarizaion and Ca2+
handling which are essential for intact insulin exocytosis. In the
setting of ER stress, short telomeres compromise b-cell mass and
worsen diabetes severity by inducing apoptosis. We also find a
relatively increased incidence of diabetes in patients with DC who
have short telomeres. Our data implicate telomere length as a
critical determinant of b-cell function and diabetes risk.
Results
Mice with short telomeres have impaired glucose
tolerance and glucose-stimulated insulin release
To test whether short telomeres impair glucose homeostasis, we
studied late generation CAST/EiJ mice that are heterozygous null
for telomerase RNA, mTR+/2
, and have short telomeres (Figure
S1A). Although they were lean, mTR+/2
mice with short
telomeres had fasting hyperglycemia compared with wild-type
mice (Figure 1A and Figure S1B). When challenged in a 2 hour
glucose tolerance test, mTR+/2
mice with short telomeres had
relatively higher serum glucose levels compared with controls
(Figure 1B). To determine whether the glucose intolerance was
due to islet-intrinsic or extrinsic factors, we measured fasting
insulin levels and found mTR+/2
mice with short telomeres had
lower levels (Figure 1C). The insulin level was inappropriately low
even after correcting for the serum glucose (Figure 1D). We next
examined insulin release in response to a glucose stimulus, and
found that mice with short telomeres had impaired insulin
secretion (Figure 1E). There were no impairments in glucose
uptake in an insulin tolerance test indicating mTR+/2
mice with
short telomeres had no defects in peripheral insulin sensitivity
(Figure 1F). To exclude a developmental defect, we examined islet
architecture and histology but did not detect any abnormalities
(Figure S1C–1D). Moreover, when we examined islets for insulitis,
we found no infiltrates. b-cell mass quantifies the total insulin
producing capacity accounting for the insulin positive area, the
total pancreas section area, as well as the pancreas weight [18].
When we measured b-cell mass, we found that it was intact (Figure
1SE). The insulin content and the percent of b-cells per islet were
also intact in mice with short telomeres compared with controls,
and there was no change in individual b-cell size (Figure 1SF–H).
The glucose intolerance, lower insulin levels, and defective
glucose-stimulated insulin release were also present in a second
strain of mice with short telomeres [mTR2/2
fourth generation
(G4) mice] on the C57BL/6 background. In this strain, telomere-
mediated phenotypes are seen only when telomerase is null, and
after successive generations of breeding [10,19] (Figure S2A–2D).
The lower basal insulin levels and glucose-stimulated insulin
release were not seen in early generation mTR2/2
G1 mice which
have long telomeres (Figure S2E–G), indicating that the absence of
telomerase alone was not sufficient to cause these defects. These
data, in two independent genetic backgrounds, indicated that short
telomeres impair glucose tolerance because of defective insulin
release. This defect is independent of b-cell mass, size and insulin
content.
Short telomeres cause mitochondrial dysfunction and
impair Ca2+
handling in islets
To probe the mechanisms underlying the telomere-mediated b-
cell dysfunction, we isolated islets and examined the kinetics of
insulin secretion ex vivo. In response to glucose stimulus, islets from
short telomere mice had defective insulin release in vitro (Figure 2A).
The defects were noted in both the first and second phases of
insulin release, as well as at maximum release induced by arginine
(Figure 2A). Insulin secretion was also impaired when exocytosis
was directly stimulated by KCl depolarization (Figure 2A). These
data established that short telomeres significantly impair insulin
release.
Glucose-stimulated insulin release is signaled by an increase in
the ATP/ADP ratio, closure of ATP-dependent K+
-channels,
depolarization of the b-cell plasma membrane, opening of voltage
dependent L-type Ca2+
-channels and an increase in cytoplasmic
free Ca2+
concentration ([Ca2+
]i), resulting in the release of insulin
containing secretory granules [20]. To define the mechanisms
underlying the telomere-mediated defects in insulin secretion, we
first measured mitochondrial membrane potential in isolated islets
after a glucose stimulus. When the mitochondrial membrane
polarizes, a change in rhodamine 123 fluorescence reflects the
extent of mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization [20]. In
response to glucose, we found a decrease in membrane
hyperpolarization in islets with short telomeres, consistent with a
defect in the respiratory chain (Figure 2B–2C). Since Ca2+
is the
main trigger of exocytosis, we next examined its influx in response
to glucose stimulation and found an impairment in [Ca2+
]i rise in
islets with short telomeres (Figure 2D). It is well-established that
subsequent to glucose stimulation, [Ca2+
]i increases and decreases
in an oscillatory manner, reflecting an intricate balance between
Ca2+
influx over the plasma membrane and Ca2+
mobilization
from intracellular stores [20]. These [Ca2+
]i oscillations are
essential for appropriate b-cell function. Although islets from mice
with short telomeres had intact slow [Ca2+
]i oscillations, there was
a decrease in the frequency of fast [Ca2+
]i oscillations, indicating a
functional defect in b-cell Ca2+
handling (Figure 2E–2G). When
we examined Ca2+
influx over the plasma membrane in the
absence of glucose, we also found impairments in mutant islets
(Figure 2H–2I). Hence, the insulin secretion defect caused by short
telomeres is multi-factorial and mediated by b-cell autonomous
defects in both mitochondrial function as well as deteriorated Ca2+
handling.
Short telomere islets have the hallmarks of senescence
The defects in insulin exocytosis suggested that DNA damage
associated with short telomeres might provoke global b-cell
dysfunction even when b-cell mass is preserved. To test whether
in b-cells with short telomeres there is evidence of DNA damage,
we examined 53BP1 foci and found an increase compared with
controls (Figure 3A). Short telomeres are a potent inducer of
senescence, we therefore examined the hallmarks of senescence
and tested whether there was evidence of impaired proliferation
and accumulation of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors. At 6
weeks of age, b-cells in mTR+/2
mice with short telomeres had a
lower proliferative fraction as measured by Ki-67 immunostaining
of insulin positive cells (Figure 3B). The slower b-cell proliferation
was also detected in C57BL/6 mTR2/2
G4 mice (Figure 3C). We
next isolated islets and quantitated p16INK4a
transcript levels by
real time RT-PCR. p16INK4a
levels increased in wild-type mice
with age, as shown previously [21] (Figure 3D–3E). However, at
every age group we examined, short telomeres induced p16INK4a
prematurely and, by 8 months of age, there was a 3-fold up-
regulation compared to wild-type mice (Figure 3D–3E). The
accumulation of p16INK4a
was a direct consequence of the short
telomeres, not the absence of telomerase, as telomerase null mice
with long telomeres did not show this increase (Figure 3E). The
accumulation was also specific to p16INK4a
and not to other genes
near the INK4a locus (e.g. p15) or other cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors including the p53 target p21 (Figure S3A–3C). There
was a trend toward accumulation of Arf, the other INK4a
transcript, in islets from mice with short telomeres (Figure S3D).
These data indicated that short telomeres impair the cell cycle

progression of b-cells and cause premature accumulation of the
senescence marker p16INK4a
in pancreatic islets.
Short telomeres cause gene-expression changes in
signaling pathways
We next examined the mechanism by which short telomeres may
affect b-cell function in the absence of b-cell loss. Senescence is
associated with altered gene expression signatures that are cell- and
context-dependent [22]. We tested whether transcriptional changes
in islets may explain the functional defects due to short telomeres.
Microarray analysis on purified islets from wild-type and mTR2/2
G4
mice showed differential expression of 1,935 genes: n =1,153
decreased (60%) and n = 782 up-regulated. A unique transcriptional
signature distinguished islets with short telomeres from controls by
clustering analysis (Figure 3F). Gene ontology revealed that multiple
pathways essential for insulin secretion were affected including signal
transduction, Ca2+
-mediated exocytosis, Ca2+
homeostasis, and K+
ion transport (Figure 3G and Table S1). The ontology also implicated
genes involved in cell cycle control and stress response processes
(Figure 3G and Table S1). The genes altered in the stress response
included the Reg gene family which had the highest fold up-
regulation (Figure 3H and Table S1). The Reg genes were initially
identified in the regenerating pancreas, and are known to accumulate
in islets from patients with type 2 diabetes [23,24]. These data
indicated that short telomeres alter islet transcriptional programs; this
signature affects multiple cellular processes which are essential for
insulin secretion.
Decreased b-cell survival due to short telomeres in the
setting of ER stress
Because short telomeres cause b-cell dysfunction, we reasoned
that telomere length will be a modifier of severity in monogenic
forms of diabetes that affect b-cell integrity. We crossed the mTR
null allele in C57BL/6 mice onto the diabetic Akita mouse that
carries a mutation in the insulin gene, Ins2C96Y/WT
, and generated
double mutant mice that have short telomeres (Figure S4A).
Mutations in the insulin gene cause diabetes in humans and in the
Akita mouse where insulin misfolding leads to ER stress and
apoptosis and clinically manifests as irreversible b-cell failure
[25,26,27]. In Ins2C96Y/WT
mice, diabetes developed as expected,
and was severe in males [27]. We therefore studied double mutant
female mice and hypothesized that short telomeres would modulate
disease severity. By 8 months, we found greater impairments in
glucose tolerance in Ins2C96Y/WT
mice that had short telomeres
(Figure 4A). The glucose intolerance was associated with a loss of b-
cell mass which did not occur in Ins2C96Y/WT
mutant mice with
long telomeres (Figure 4B). Ins2C96Y/WT
mice with short telomeres
also had lower serum insulin levels (Figure 4C). Consistent with a b-
cell intrinsic defect, these phenotypes were not due to abnormalities
in insulin resistance (Figure S4B).
We next examined whether short telomeres affected the rate of b-
cell apoptosis due to ER stress in Akita mice. In the absence of ER
stress, the baseline cell death rate of b-cells was low, and there was no
difference between wild-type and short telomere mice (Figure 4D).
However, in the setting of ER stress, we identified a two-fold increase in
TUNEL positive b-cells in Ins2C96Y/WT
mice with short telomeres
compared with Ins2C96Y/WT
(Figure 4D). These data indicated that
short telomeres cause additive b-cell dysfunction in the setting of ER
stress, decreasing the threshold for apoptosis. This effect clinically
manifests as more severe diabetes associated with loss of b-cell mass.
Increased incidence of diabetes in DC
Our data indicated that short telomeres cause b-cell dysfunction
in mice. To address whether telomere length contributes to disease

in humans, we asked whether patients with DC might be at risk for
developing diabetes. We found several published case reports that
have incidentally reported on individuals who carried the
diagnosis of DC and who had impaired glucose homeostasis
[28,29,30]. These individuals were diagnosed with glucose
intolerance or diabetes at 20 months, 21, 22 and 50 years of
age. In our registry of families with DC and related telomere
syndromes, we queried 20 consecutive individuals from 7 families,
and identified 3 individuals who developed insulin-dependent
diabetes prior to the age of 30. The clinical details of 2 of the 3
individuals are listed in Figure S5. Given the expected incidence of
diabetes in this age group (3 per 1000), the likelihood that diabetes
would occur by chance alone is low (P,0.001, chi-square test).
Discussion
The study of the telomerase knockout mouse has particular
significance for understanding the genetics of type 2 diabetes since
the short telomere defect that is present in this model is acquired
universally in human aging. Over the last decade, telomere-
mediated phenotypes identified in the mouse have consistently
converged with the human age-related disease phenotypes [15].
Here we show that short telomeres are sufficient to recapitulate the
glucose intolerance and insulin secretion defects which occur in
the early stages of human age-related diabetes. Telomere length is
a polymorphic trait, and short telomeres are a uniquely inherited
genotype that can cause degenerative disease even when
telomerase is wild-type [17]. In recent cross-sectional studies,
short telomeres have been associated with type 2 diabetes
[31,32,33,34]. Our data indicate that short telomeres are not
simply associated with, but are a relevant modifier of diabetes risk
and severity, and may be a valuable biomarker that identifies
individuals at greatest risk in clinical settings.
In our study of mice with short telomeres, we find both in vivo
and ex vivo defects in b-cell insulin secretion. The insulin secretion
impairments surprisingly occur in the presence of intact insulin
content and b-cell mass. The defective insulin secretion is multi-
factorial and appears to be due to simultaneous, independent
impairments in key exocytosis pathways including glucose-
dependent mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, as well
as glucose-independent defects in Ca2+
handling. Our data
implicate gene expression changes in the setting of senescence as
underlying these defects. The transcriptional changes we identify
affect pathways essential for b-cell function including Ca2+
-mediated exocytosis. These findings are in contrast to a recent
study which reported that insulin secretion defects in late
generation mTR2/2
mice are due to a decrease in insulin positive
cells [35]. Our ex vivo studies indicate that short telomeres are
sufficient to cause insulin secretion defects even when b-cell
number is intact. Our data support a model where short telomeres
induce senescence-associated gene expression changes in b-cells;
this program contributes to defective signaling and clinically
manifests as impaired glucose homeostasis. Short telomeres are
canonically known to cause degenerative disease by inducing a loss
of stem cells [10,16]. Our findings suggest that, in some settings,
even when cell mass is preserved, short telomeres compromise
organ function. Our data therefore provide evidence for a novel
mechanism of telomere-mediated disease where short telomeres
can compromise organ homeostasis in the absence of overt cell
loss.
In the Akita mouse we show that in the setting of ER stress,
short telomeres cause additive injury that results in loss of b-cell
mass. Short telomeres are a potent inducer of cell death [10], and
in the presence of ER stress, the additive damage signals from both
telomere dysfunction and the misfolded protein response evoke an
apoptotic program that is otherwise not apparent in the presence
of short telomeres alone. In contrast to the glucose intolerance we
observed in male mTR2/2
G4 mice, we did not identify baseline
impaired glucose tolerance in female mTR2/2
iG4. This observa-
tion is consistent with the known increased penetrance of b-cell
mediated diabetes in male mice [36]. ER stress and loss of b-cell
mass occur in the late stages of diabetes [2]. Our data indicate that
short telomeres cooperate with ER stress to worsen diabetes
severity and, because they accumulate with age, may contribute to
the progressive natural history of diabetes which culminates in b-
cell loss. Therefore both the senescence and apoptotic downstream
consequences of telomere shortening contribute to the b-cell
degenerative phenotype.
We identified an increased incidence of diabetes in a small
cohort of DC patients with short telomeres. Idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis patients, who also have short telomeres, have been
reported to be more prone to develop diabetes [37,38,39].
Diabetes incidence is known to be increased in other syndromes
associated with DNA damage including Fanconi anemia where
10% of patients are affected [40]. Its association with DC, if
replicated in larger cohorts, would suggest that, in addition to bone
marrow failure and fibrotic disorders, diabetes may be a
manifestation of telomere-mediated disease in syndromes of
telomere shortening, albeit at lower penetrance. In contrast to
the bone marrow failure phenotype which is prominent in the
setting of short telomeres, our data indicate that telomere reserves
limit the function of tissues of relatively slow turnover such as b-
cells. How do we explain that short telomeres limit the function of
tissues of slow turnover? One model is that although b-cell have
slow turnover, they still undergo several fold expansion by
adulthood [41]. Thus although the basal proliferation rate is slow,
cell turnover superimposed on genetically determined shorter
telomere length may be sufficient to precipitate organ dysfunction.
It is also possible that, in addition, short telomere length may be a
first insult that decreases the threshold for sustaining additional
injury that accumulates with age such as ER stress, as our data
indicate. The genetic evidence we show therefore supports that
telomere function is essential for the integrity of tissues of slow
turnover, and indicates that telomere shortening plays a role in a
broader spectrum of specific age-related disorders than previously
appreciated.
In summary, short telomeres limit insulin secretion by affecting
global b-cell signaling in the setting of senescence. With ER stress,

Methods
Mouse studies
Mice were housed at the Johns Hopkins University and all
procedures were approved by its Animal Care and Use Committee
(approval ID MO07M492). We studied mTR+/2
mice on the Cast/
EiJ background that were offspring of heterozygous breeding for 8–
10 generations [16]. C57BL/6 mTR2/2
mice were bred for four
generations [19]. Glucose levels were measured using a home
glucometer. For glucose tolerance tests, mice were fasted overnight
then injected with glucose 2.5 g/kg intraperitoneally. Serum insulin
levels were measured by ELISA (Mercodia). For insulin tolerance
tests, mice were injected with insulin 0.5 U/kg. To quantitate the
insulin positive area, we performed immunohistochemistry on
paraffin-embedded sections, 140 microns apart, and quantitated the
area using Nikon Elements software. b-cell mass was determined by
calculating the ratio of the insulin positive area to total pancreas
sectional area, and multiplying by the pancreas weight [18]. For
insulin content, whole pancreas homogenate was extracted in acid/
ethanol (0.18M HCl/70% ethanol) overnight at 4uC and insulin
levels were determined by ELISA after normalizing for total
protein. We obtained C57BL/6 Ins2C96Y/WT
mice from the
Jackson Laboratory. We generated Ins2C96Y/WT
with short
telomeres using an intergenerational strategy [42]. All experiments
included age-matched male mice, except in the Akita studies where
we studied the more attenuated phenotype in females.
Islet in vitro studies
Dynamic insulin release from islets was analyzed [43]. Insulin
measurements were performed by a microsphere-based two-
photon excitation fluorometer (TPX-technology; ArcDia Diag-
nostics). Insulin data were normalized to DNA content using
PicoGreen (Invitrogen). Mitochondrial membrane potential was
analyzed using rhodamine 123 [44]. To measure [Ca2+
]i. islets
were incubated with 2 mM fura-2 AM, and changes in
fluorescence ratio 340/380 were analyzed [45]. Experiments were

performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M with a fluorescence imaging
system. [Ca2+
]i oscillations were analyzed using power spectral
analysis in Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.) [46]. The amplitudes of
fast and slow oscillations were calculated as the square root of the
total power of periods from 6 to 60 s (FastOsc), and 60 to 600 s
(SlowOsc), respectively [47]. Power spectral density for fast
oscillations was calculated by the Welsh method [45], and
standard fast Fourier transform power spectrum was used for
slow oscillations. The dominant fast and slow periods were
obtained from peaks in respective power spectrum.
Immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR and microarray
We measured telomere length using quantitative fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) [37] and detected DNA damage using
53BP1 immunuofluorescence (Novus) [48]. Antibodies for insulin,
glucagon, somatostatin and Ki-67 were obtained from Dako. We
delivered EdU (2 mg, Invitrogen) over a 14 day period via an
implanted subcutaneous pump (Alzet) and used reagents in Click-iT
EdU (Invitrogen) for detection. For apoptosis studies, we performed
the TUNEL assay (Roche). All histology studies were quantitated
blinded to genotype. For expression studies, we purified islets [49],
and extracted total RNA using RNeasy (Qiagen). To obtain
sufficient RNA, we isolated islets from mTR2/2
mice on the
C57BL/6 background which have larger islets. We performed
quantitative real time RT-PCR using iQ SYBR Green Supermix
(BioRad, Hercules, CA. Primer sequences are listed in Table S2.
The expression of each gene was normalized to Hprt levels.
Transcriptional profiling of purified islets was performed using
Mouse Exon 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix) at the Johns Hopkins
Microarray Facility. CEL file data were extracted and normalized
with PartekH Genomics SuiteTM
software using the Robust
Multichip Analysis algorithm [50]. To explore the broadest range
of transcripts, Affymetrix extended probes were imported, yielding
transcripts of which 112,207 have annotation with 50,601 at the
gene or mRNA-level. Genes with greater than 1.5 fold change and
P-value,0.05 were considered significant. We used the Spotfire
(TIBCO) platform and Gene Ontology (August 2010) to analyze
gene expression. Microarray data is MIAME compliant and that
the raw data has been deposited in GEO (GEO Series GSE25040).
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software
(La Jolla), and means were compared using Student’s t-test.
Subjects and ethics statement
Probands and family members were evaluated through the
Johns Hopkins Hospital, and written informed consent was
obtained from all participants. The Johns Hopkins Medicine
Institutional Review Board approved the study. Individuals were
eligible if they had classic mucocutaneous features of DC, or
carried a mutant telomerase gene. We performed telomere length
analysis using flow-cytometry and FISH, and sequenced the
known DC genes from genomic DNA [37].

with diabetes and dyskeratosis congenita. Case 1 had classic
dyskeratosis congenita features and, in Case 2, we identified a CRG
heterozygous substitution at nucleotide 204 in hTR which impairs
telomerase activity (P,0.001, not shown). B. Case 1 and Case 2
have lymphocyte telomere length below the 1st
percentile compared
with age-matched controls. Percentile lines were generated based on
data from 400 controls. This range is highly predictive of a germline
defect in telomerase (Alder et al PNAS 2008). C. X-linked pattern of
dyskeratosis congenita inheritance in the family for index case 1. D.
The family for index case 2 displays autosomal dominant
inheritance. Both probands have relatives with a history of
pulmonary and liver disease along with aplastic anemia, consistent
with the diagnosis of an inherited telomere syndrome.
