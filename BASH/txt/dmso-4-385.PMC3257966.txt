Abstract: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of anabolic-androgenic
steroids and resistance training (RT) on insulin sensitivity in ovariectomized rats. Adult female
Wistar rats were divided into ten experimental groups (n = 5 animals per group): (1) sedentary
(Sed-Intact); (2) sedentary ovariectomized (Sed-Ovx); (3) sedentary nandrolone (Sed-Intact-ND);
(4) sedentary ovariectomized plus nandrolone (Sed-Ovx-ND); (5) trained (TR-Intact); (6) trained
nandrolone (TR-Intact-ND); (7) trained ovariectomized (TR-Ovx); (8) trained ovariectomized
plus ­nandrolone; (9) trained sham; and (10) trained ovariectomized plus sham. Four sessions of
RT were used, during which the animals climbed a 1.1 m vertical ladder with weights attached to
their tails. The sessions were performed once every 3 days, with between four and nine climbs
and with eight to twelve dynamic movements per climb. To test the sensitivity of insulin in the
pancreas, glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed. For insulin sensitivity, there was
a statistically significant interaction for the TR-Ovx group, which presented higher sensitivity
than the Sed-Intact, Sed-Ovx, and TR-Intact groups. Sed-Intact-ND and TR-Intact-ND groups
exhibited higher values of insulin sensitivity than the Sed-Intact group. Except for theTR-Intact
group, sensitivity was greater in trained groups than in the Sed-Intact group. There was higher
insulin sensitivity in the TR-Intact-ND group than in the Sed-Intact and Sed-Intact-ND groups
(P , 0.05). In conclusion, ovariectomy and short-term RT alone induced no change on insulin
action. Administration of nandrolone decanoate improved insulin action, mainly when it was
associated with RT.

Introduction
Menopause has been associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease,
diabetes, skeletal muscle wasting (sarcopenia), bone mineral density loss (osteopenia),
changes in body composition, lipid profile, fat deposition, and increased inflammatory
markers.1
Ovariectomy is an experimental model used to mimic menopause in animals,
inducing an increase in food intake and body weight, insulin resistance, sarcopenia, and
muscle force generation.2–4
It has been shown that these deleterious effects of ovariectomy
can be partially reversed by exercise training and steroid hormone replacement.2,5,6
Physical training, such as resistance, jumping, or swimming exercise, and wheel or
treadmill running by rats has repeatedly been reported to be associated with enhanced
insulin sensitivity, glucose transportation, increased bone density, improved immune
system, and positive adaptations in cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and adipose
tissue.7–12
However, these positive adaptations in ovariectomized rats have mainly
been observed with long-term exercise training.

Anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) compounds are
synthetic androgens commonly used by athletes to increase
physical strength, endurance, and performance13
and to mod-
ify vascular function.14
Although many studies have examined
physiological, morphological, and psychological responses
to AAS use in males, less is known about the incidence,
patterns, and consequences ofAAS use in females.15–17
AAS
compounds may be used therapeutically in women, usually
in small doses, to treat aplastic anemia and may also be used
as antitumor agents in breast cancer and osteoporosis. In this
regard, AASs such as nandrolone decanoate (ND) modulate
transcription and translation of pancreatic islets cells and
improve insulin action and glucose uptake.15,16
However, it is
important to note that the World Anti-Doping Agency18
lists
ND as a prohibited substance, with use of ND considered
as doping.
Testosterone increases insulin mRNA levels in vitro as
well as in vivo.Additionally, the stimulating effect of testos-
terone is also observed on insulin promoter activity, content,
and release in male rats.19
In this regard, nandrolone and other
anabolic steroids have been used by athletes to build muscle
mass and to enhance weight-lifting performance. A recent
placebo-controlled study showed that supraphysiologic doses
of testosterone resulted in an increase in muscle mass and
strength in humans.20
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first
study to investigate the effects of ovarian hormone absence,
short-term resistance training (RT), and AAS therapy on
glucose tolerance and glucose-stimulated insulin response.
The authors’ initial hypothesis was that resistance exercise
associated with AAS would improve tissue response.
Methods
Animals
Fifty adult female Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus var.
­albinus, Rodentia, Mammalia) from the breeding colony of
the ­Methodist University of Piracicaba, Brazil, were used in
this study. They were approximately 90 days old and had an
initial weight of approximately 250 g, plus or minus 30 g.
The animals were kept in collective cages (five rats per cage)
and they received commercial rodent chow (Labina-Purina,
­Descalvado, São Paulo, Brazil) and water ad libitum. The
room temperature was kept constant at 23°C, plus or minus
2°C, and the room had a cycle of 12 hours of light and 12 hours
of dark, with lights on from 0600 to 1800 hours each day.
The Federal University of São Carlos Committee of
Experimental Animals approved the research (protocol
No. 048/2007). All animal procedures were conducted in
­accordance with the guide for care and use of laboratory
animals from the National Research Council, 1996.
Experimental groups
The experimental design is presented in Table 1. Fifty rats
were randomly distributed into the following ten experimental
groups (n = 5 animals per group): (1) sedentary (Sed-Intact);
(2) sedentary ovariectomized (Sed-Ovx); (3) sedentary
nandrolone (Sed-Intact-ND); (4) sedentary ovariectomized
plus nandrolone (Sed-OVX-ND); (5) trained (TR-Intact);
(6) trained nandrolone (TR-Intact-ND); (7) trained ovariecto-
mized (TR-Ovx); (8) trained ovariectomized plus nandrolone
(TR-OVX-ND); (9) trained sham (TR-Intact-sham); and
(10) trained ovariectomized plus sham (TR-OVX-sham).
The Sed-Intact and Sed-Ovx animals were kept in their
cages for 4 days without any type of exercise. The Sed-Ovx
animals had their ovaries removed.Animals in the ND groups
received an intramuscular injection of ND (Organon do
­Brasil, São Paulo, Brazil) into the hind limb every training
day.Animals in the RT groups underwent four sessions of the
proposed RT protocol. Sham groups received an intramus-
cular injection of the vehicle only (propylene glycol; Galena
Química e Farmacêutica ltda, Campinas, SP, Brazil).
Ovariectomy
Rats were ovariectomized at 90 days of age, according to
the technique described by Kaluo.21
Ethyl ether was used as
anesthetic in all animals undergoing ovariectomy.All animals
were given 1 week of recovery after the surgical procedure.
RT exercise
The four sessions of RT included climbing exercise, and the
sessions were performed once every 3 days. Initially, the rats
were adapted to the RT protocol, which required the animals
to climb a vertical ladder (1.1 × 0.18 m, 2 cm grid, 80° incline)
with weights secured to their tails. The size of the ladder
induced the animals to perform eight to twelve dynamic move-
ments per climb.The load apparatus was secured to the tail by
wrapping the proximal portion of the tail with a self-adhesive
foam strip.AVelcro strap was wrapped around the foam strip
and fastened. With the load apparatus secured to the tail, each
rat was placed at the bottom of the ladder and familiarized with
climbing. If necessary, a stimulus with tweezers was applied
to the animal’s tail to initiate movement. At the top of the
ladder, the rats reached a housing chamber (20 × 20 × 20 cm),
where they were allowed to rest for 120 seconds. This proce-
dure was repeated until the rats voluntarily climbed the ladder
three consecutive times, without stimulus.

Resistance training, anabolic-androgenic steroids, and insulin sensitivity
Three days after this familiarization, the first training ses-
sion took place.The session consisted of four to eight ladder
climbs while carrying progressively heavier loads. For the
initial climb, the load carried was 75% of the animal’s body
mass. After this, an additional 30 g weight was added, until
a load was reached with which the rat could not climb the
entire length of the ladder. Failure was determined when the
animal could not progress up the ladder after three successive
stimuli to the tail. The highest load successfully carried the
entire length of the ladder was considered the rat’s maximal
carrying capacity for that training session. The next training
session consisted of four ladder climbs with 50%, 75%, 90%,
and 100% of the rat’s previous maximal carrying capacity,
determined in the previous session. During subsequent lad-
der climbs, an additional 30 g load was added until a new
maximal carrying capacity was determined.The RT protocol
was adapted from Hornberger and Faccar,9
according to the
needs of the present research.
AAS treatment
Nonphysiologic doses of ND (0.1 mg/kg) diluted in pro-
pylene glycol22
were injected subcutaneously at the triceps
surae on both posterior paws and in an alternating fashion.
The drug was injected after every RT session. This dose is
comparable with the dose reported as being frequently used
for hormone replacement therapy.22,23
The control groups that did not receive AAS treatment
(Sed-Intact, TR-Intact-sham, and TR-OVX-sham) received
the vehicle propylene glycol.24
Insulin sensitivity tests
Glucose tolerance test
Animals were anesthetized with sodium thiopental
(40 mg/kg) (Abbott Laboratorios do Brasil, São Paulo,
Brazil), and glucose solution (1 g/kg), was administered
intraperitoneally after a 4-hour fast for the glucose tolerance
test (GTT). Blood samples were collected before (0 minutes)
and at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 90 minutes after glucose
loading, and glycemia was determined using a glucometer
(Advantage®
; Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN).
Insulin sensitivity was determined by calculating the area
above the curve of the GTT. Lower values of area indicate
higher insulin sensitivity, while higher values of area indicate
lower insulin sensitivity. For animals in the training groups,
the GTT was performed 24 hours after the last RT training
session.
Insulin tolerance test
Twenty-four hours after the GTT, all animals were submit-
ted to an insulin tolerance test (ITT). Briefly, animals were
anesthetized with sodium thiopental (40 mg/kg) and a 1 U/kg
(1 U/mL) dose of fast insulin (Biobrás, São Paulo, Brazil) was
administered intraperitoneally. Blood samples were collected
before (0 minutes) and at 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes after
insulin loading, and glucose was determined by glucometer.
Tissue sensitivity was assayed by calculating the area
above the curve of ITT. Lower values of area indicate higher
tissue sensitivity, while higher values of area indicate lower
tissue sensitivity.

Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean plus or minus the standard
­deviation. The statistical analysis was performed initially
using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test and the homo-
scedasticity test (Bartlett criterion).All variables analyzed in
the study presented normal distribution and homoscedastic-
ity, which allowed the application of the analysis of variance
test (variables: RT + ND + sham × different moments) and
F test. Tukey’s post hoc test was applied in the event of a
significant (P , 0.05) F ratio. The software package Statis-
tica (version 6.1; StatSoft Inc, Tulsa, OK) was used, with a
significance level of 0.05.
Results
Effects of ovariectomy and RT on insulin
and tissue sensitivity
Therewasastatisticallysignificantinteractionamonggroupsfor
insulin sensitivity. The TR-Ovx group presented a lower value
for area above the curve, indicating higher insulin sensitivity
than the Sed-Intact (45.2%), Sed-Ovx (52.4%), and TR-Intact
(32.1%)groups(Figure 1A).Forthetissuesensitivity,therewas
a statistically significant difference only between TR-Ovx and
Sed-Ovxgroups,indicatedbythehigherrateofglucoseremoved
during the GTT in the TR-Ovx group (Figure 1B).
Effects of ovariectomy and ND
The Sed-Intact-ND group presented higher insulin sensitiv-
ity than the other sedentary groups: Sed-Intact, Sed-Ovx,
and Sed-OVX-ND groups being 61.6%, 66.6%, and 66.4%,
respectively (Figure 2A). Similarly, for the tissue ­sensitivity,
the Sed-OVX-ND group presented improved values com-
pared with the Sed-Intact, Sed-Ovx, and Sed-Intact-ND
groups (Figure 2B).
Effects of RT and ND
Therewasaninteractionbetweentheinterventions(RTandND)
in insulin sensitivity. The Sed-Intact-ND and TR-Intact-ND
groups exhibited higher values of insulin sensitivity than the
Sed-Intact group, as shown in Figure 3A. Also, the TR-Intact
group showed reduced insulin sensitivity compared with the
Sed-Intact-ND and TR-Intact-ND groups (Figure 3A). The
TR-Intact-ND group exhibited higher tissue sensitivity than
the Sed-Intact and Sed-Intact-ND groups (Figure 3B).
Effects of ovariectomy, RT, and ND
Except for the TR-Intact group, the trained groups (TR-
Intact-sham, TR-OVX-sham, TR-Ovx, and TR-OVX-ND)
showed greater tissue sensitivity than the Sed-Intact group
(Figure 4A). Moreover, the trained groups TR-Intact-sham,
TR-OVX-sham,TR-Ovx, andTR-OVX-ND exhibited greater
tissue sensitivity than the TR-Intact group (Figure 4A).
TheTR-OVX-ND group showed greater tissue sensitivity
than the Sed-Intact, TR-Ovx, and TR-Intact-sham groups.
Furthermore, theTR-OVX-ND group exhibited higher tissue
sensitivity than the TR-OVX-sham group (Figure 4B).
Discussion
The purpose of the present study was to analyze the influ-
ence of ovariectomy, RT, and AASs on insulin and tissue
­sensitivity. The authors’ initial hypothesis was partially
confirmed, in that ovariectomy and AASs changed tissue
responsivity. Additionally, AASs improved insulin sensitiv-
ity, mainly when associated with RT, short-term RT alone
caused minor effects on glucose homeostasis, and AASs
appeared to modulate insulin action.

AAS administration has been reported to increase the
transcription and translation of insulin from pancreatic
islet cells and to improve insulin action, modulating glu-
cose levels.15,16
Marin et al25
reported that anabolic steroids
alter insulin sensitivity, and therefore a single supraphysi-
ologic dose of ND (250 mg) improved insulin sensitivity,
while a higher dose (500 mg) showed no effects on insulin
sensitivity.
Regarding the effects of RT in intact animals without the
use of exogenous ND, there was no increase in insulin and tis-
sue sensitivity, which might have been related with the short-
term exercise training (Figure 1).This can be partly explained
by a study by Hernandez et al26
in which animals showed a
temporal pattern for changes in rate of glucose uptake after
resistance exercise: glucose uptake initially decreased after a
period of 3 hours and then markedly increased 6 hours later,
remaining elevated 12 hours post exercise in male intact rats.
­Furthermore, chronic exercise training has been reported
to promote an increase in insulin receptors associated with
increased activity of the PI3-kinase intracellular pathway and
the transportation of GLUT4 protein to the plasma mem-
brane, which enhances insulin signaling in tissue.27,28
On the
other hand, Christ et al29
showed that adaptations occurred
during training could lead to improved insulin-stimulated
muscle glucose uptake without affecting insulin receptor
signaling through the PI3-kinase pathway.
Regarding the effects of ND and RT, the present study
revealed that, independently of the training status (sedentary
or trained), the animals that received ND showed higher
sensitivity response, with lower values for area above the
curve. This response could be associated with the capacity
ofAAS administration in modifying influx of calcium related
to insulin secretion.30
In addition, Hernandez et al26
showed
that arterial plasma insulin concentrations are not different
between trained and sedentary groups when measured during
an isotope infusion.

Urtado et al
Ovarian hormones, especially estrogen, participate in
the regulation of the pancreatic secretion of insulin, insu-
lin sensitivity, and carbohydrate metabolism. The absence
of estrogen hormone is associated with several metabolic
disorders such as insulin resistance and altered glucose
metabolism.31–34
The results from the present study revealed
no alteration in insulin tissue sensitivity in ovariectomized
rats. These results might have been associated with short-
term ovariectomy, since a period of 14–21 days seems to be
necessary for postoperative hormonal re-adaptation, as for the
manifestation of the deleterious effects of estrogen absence.26
Furthermore, studies with long-term ovariectomy showed
negative effects of it on the morphology of pancreatic islets,
insulin secretion, and glucose oxidation.35–37
­Ovariectomized
rats submitted to short-term resistance exercise exhibited
an improvement in insulin sensitivity, with lower effects on
peripheral sensitivity.
In this study, administration of ND improved insulin action
and, as a consequence, increased glucose uptake. Hobbs et al38
showed that acute higher doses of ND in humans enhanced
glucoseavailabilitywithnochangeinglucosemetabolism.The
chronic effects of ND require further clinical tests in order to
guaranteeitsuseasatherapeuticdrug.Thus,theresultsfromthe
present study should be considered as preliminary. As well as
this,somelimitationsofthepresentstudyshouldbeconsidered.
For example, the absence of serial measurements after the first
and last RT sessions and 2–4 weeks after the last RT session,
which would clarify if these effects were derived from short-
termRTorsimplyasessionofresistanceexercise.Additionally,
the administration of ether stimulates catecholamine release,
whichmayresultinamoderateriseinbloodglucoseconcentra-
tions and a wide range of other metabolic changes.39
Conclusion
In conclusion, the presented study data provide new
insights into some aspects of the regulation of insulin and
tissue sensitivity. Ovariectomy and short-term RT induced
minor change in insulin tissue sensitivity. Acute adminis-
tration of ND improved insulin action. When associated
with short-term RT, ND also improved insulin and tissue
sensitivity.
