REVIEW
Immunological characteristics of human mesenchymal
stem cells and multipotent adult progenitor cells

Somatic, also termed adult, stem cells are highly attractive biomedical cell candidates because of their extensive replication
potential and functional multilineage differentiation capacity. They can be used for drug and toxicity screenings in preclinical
studies, as in vitro model to study differentiation or for regenerative medicine to aid in the repair of tissues or replace tissues
that are lost upon disease, injury or ageing. Multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are
two types of adult stem cells derived from bone marrow that are currently being used clinically for tissue regeneration and for
their immunomodulatory and trophic effects. This review will give an overview of the phenotypic and functional differences
between human MAPCs and MSCs, with a strong emphasis on their immunological characteristics. Finally, we will discuss the
clinical studies in which MSCs and MAPCs are already used.

COMPARISON OF HUMAN MSCS AND MAPCS
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) co-exist in the bone marrow (BM)
with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and have the potential to
differentiate towards lineages of mesenchymal origin, including bone,
cartilage, fat, connective tissue, smooth muscle and hematopoietic
supportive stroma.1 Although originally isolated from BM, MSCs
have since been isolated from many other tissues, including adipose
tissue, synovial ﬂuid, periosteum, umbilical cord blood and several
fetal tissues.2–5
Once established in culture, MSCs display a variety of cell surface
antigens that may vary depending on the isolation and expansion
methods used. They usually express CD73, CD90 and CD105 and lack
expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II
surface molecules and endothelial (CD31) and hematopoietic-speciﬁc
antigens (CD34, CD45, CD14).1,6 Additional criteria that are used to
deﬁne MSC are their plastic adherence and their capacity to diffe-
rentiate in vitro towards osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes.6
As initial MSC cultures are very heterogeneous, several groups
have proposed speciﬁc cell surface antigens to prospectively isolate
MSCs (for example, STRO1 (stromal precursor antigen 1), VCAM-1
(vascular cell adhesion molecule 1), SH2 (Src homology 2), SH3/
SH4, CD271, GD2 (ganglioside 2), SSEA4 (stage-speciﬁc embryonic
antigen-4)).7–11 However, it was only recently that the exact nature of
human MSCs (hMSCs) in vivo was elucidated. Sachetti et al.12 found
that self-renewing osteoprogenitors in human BM, able to generate
bone, stroma and organize a hematopoietic microenvironment
in vivo, are CD146high (a melanoma-associated cell adhesion
molecule). These CD146þ cells are located in the subendothelial
layer of BM sinusoids and represent adventitial reticular cells, a
subpopulation of pericytes. As pericytes are found in nearly every
other organ, it has been hypothesized that all MSCs found in
different tissues are also derived from the pericyte fraction in
vessels. Indeed, Crisan et al.13 isolated hMSCs based on a
combination of pericyte-expressed antigens (CD146, NG2 (nerve/
glial antigen 2) and PDGFRb (platelet-derived growth factor
receptor-b)) from multiple organs (including skeletal muscle, BM,
umbilical cord blood, placenta, pancreas and white adipose tissue).
Interestingly, they demonstrated that these cells, irrespective of the
tissue of origin, were skeletal myogenic in vivo and ex vivo and
exhibited, at the clonal level, adipo-, osteo- and chondrogenic
potential in vitro and formed calciﬁed tissue in vivo.
In 2002, the group of Catherine Verfaillie described the derivation
of rare cells from rat and mouse BM with characteristics different
from most adult stem cells. The cells, termed multipotent adult
progenitor cells (MAPCs), could proliferate without senescence and
could, at the single cell level, differentiate in vitro into cells of the three
germ layers.14 When injected into the blastocyst, a single MAPC of
one of the murine lines could contribute to most somatic tissues,
albeit in general, the contribution was very low. Upon transplantation
in a non-irradiated recipient, mouse MAPCs engrafted at low levels

into the hematopoietic lineage and the epithelium from the lung, gut
and liver. Rodent MAPCs were cultured at low density and in the
presence of leukemia inhibitory factor, epidermal growth factor (EGF)
and platelet-derived growth factor. They were signiﬁcantly smaller in
size than their MSC counterpart and did not express MHC class I and
CD44 antigens. Like MSCs, they did not express CD45 or other
mature hematopoietic markers.
Since 2003, culture conditions under which rodent MAPCs are
isolated have changed, including isolation and maintenance at 5%
oxygen, use of a different serum and maintenance at higher cell
densities for the ﬁrst 4 weeks in culture, compared with the previously
described MAPCs. These studies have shown that rodent MAPCs can
only be detected after 2–3 months of in vitro culture. This is
associated with an abrupt change in cell morphology accompanied
by the expression of the embryonic stem cell (ESC)-associated
transcription factor Oct4 (but not Nanog and Sox2) and the primitive
endoderm-speciﬁc genes Gata6, Gata4, Sox7 and Sox17.15–17 As such,
rodent MAPCs resemble extraembryonic endoderm cells (Xen cells)18
and extraembryonic endoderm precursor cells (Xen-P cells).19 The
levels of Oct4 mRNA in these newly isolated mouse MAPCs range
from 1% to 10% compared with mouse ESCs and are nearly
equivalent to mouse ESCs for rat MAPCs.15 Compared with the
initially described MAPCs, mouse MAPCs now express high levels of
c-kit and rat MAPCs express high levels of CD31. These high Oct4
MAPCs also show robust differentiation towards endothelium and
hepatocyte-like cells.15 Ross et al.20 showed that MAPCs can form
smooth muscle cells, which are phenotypically and functionally
similar to primary mature smooth muscle cells. A four-step
protocol mimicking the embryonic development of the liver was
developed to allow differentiation of rodent high Oct4 MAPCs, in a
similar fashion as mouse and human ESCs, towards functional
hepatocytes-like cells.21 Rodent MAPCs, like MSCs, also
differentiate towards adipo-, chondro- and osteocytes.15,22 Although
the originally isolated rodent MAPCs differentiated robustly towards
the neuroectodermal lineage, thereby generating neuron-like cells with
electrophysiological properties similar to CNS neurons,23 it is unclear
whether the newer MAPC lines can be differentiated beyond the Sox2/
Pax6 neural progenitor stage.15
Similarly to rodent MAPCs, human MAPCs (hMAPCs) can also be
expanded long term, and several groups have shown that they can
differentiate not only towards mesenchymal cell types (adipocytes,
osteoblasts, chondrocytes and smooth muscle cells) but also towards
endothelium (which can be speciﬁed to both venous and arterial),
skeletal muscle and hepatocyte-like cells.20,24–28 In contrast to rodent
MAPCs, hMAPCs do not require LIF for their self-renewal and do not
express signiﬁcant levels of Oct4. When grafted in vivo in a model of
severe limb ischemia, hMAPCs signiﬁcantly increased angiogenesis
and endogenous stem cell proliferation, leading to less ischemia and
therefore improved skeletal muscle function.29
A recent comparative analysis between hMAPCs and hMSCs has
shown that they can be considered as two distinct cell populations
(Table 1).30 hMAPCs could be expanded in vitro for 470 population
doublings, which was signiﬁcantly longer than hMSCs (20–25
population doublings). Four surface proteins were found to be
differentially expressed: alkaline phosphatase, CD140a and CD140b
were not expressed on hMAPCs, whereas hMSCs expressed alkaline
phosphatase and CD140a at low levels and CD140b at high levels, and
ﬁnally MHC class I was highly expressed on hMSCs but at lower levels
on hMAPCs.
Furthermore, both cell types could differentiate into typical
mesenchymal cell types, including adipocytes, osteoblasts,
chrondocytes and smooth muscle cells, but only hMAPCs showed
robust endothelial differentiation. Finally, a transcriptome analysis
revealed hMAPCs and hMSCs as two distinct cell populations, with
each expressing a set of characteristic genes that correlated with the
functional ability of the cells. Whether hMSCs and hMAPCs represent
truly different cell types in vivo is not known yet, but the study from
Roobrouck et al.30 showed that the in vitro characteristics of the cells
are, at least, partially dependent on the culture conditions.
IMMUNOGENICITY AND IMMUNOMODULATORY CAPACITIES
OF HMSCS IN VITRO
Adaptive immune system
MSCs interact with a wide range of immune cells and their
interaction with allogeneic T cells has been studied by many groups.
First, MSCs have been demonstrated to be poor stimulators of an
in vitro allogeneic T-cell response and fail to induce activation of
allogeneic T cells. To adequately activate T cells, two signals are
required.31 The ﬁrst signal involves the recognition of MHC
molecules together with an antigen on the surface of an antigen-
presenting cell (APC) by the T-cell receptor. Subsequently, T-cell
activation requires a costimulatory signal involving interaction of
CD28 on the T cell with CD80 or CD86 (B7 superfamily) on the APC.
MSCs express low levels of MHC class I molecules on their surface

but lack the expression of MHC class II and the costimulatory
molecules CD80, CD86 or CD40. The expression of both MHC class I
and class II can be upregulated upon stimulation with interferon
(IFN)-g. However, this upregulation was not sufﬁcient to enhance the
immunogenicity of MSCs.32,33 In addition, Klyushnenkova et al.32
showed that the lack of T-cell response was not due to a deﬁciency in
co-stimulatory signals, as retroviral transduction of MSCs with B7-1
or B7-2 did not result in T-cell proliferation. Accordingly, Tse et al.34
showed that IFN-g pretreated MSCs, even in combination with direct
costimulation via an anti-CD28 antibody could not induce a T-cell
proliferative response. Aside from that, they showed that the lack of
proliferation was not due to MSC-induced T-cell apoptosis.
Second, MSCs have been shown to suppress both naive and
memory T lymphocyte activation and proliferation induced by
alloantigens,33,35,36 mitogens35–37 and CD3 and CD28 anti-
bodies.33,38 This suppression is without any MHC restriction as it
can be mediated by both autologous and allogeneic MSCs.35,36,39
Most studies agree that a soluble factor is involved, as MSCs are
suppressive when MSCs and T lymphocytes are separated by a semi-
permeable membrane.
Several candidate mediators have been postulated, but the available
data are often contradictory. A role for transforming growth factor-b
(TGF-b) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been suggested by
Di Nicola et al.36, who found that antibodies against TGF-b and HGF
partially restored proliferation of puriﬁed T cells stimulated with
allogeneic peripheral blood lymphocytes. TGF-b and HGF were not
involved when T cells were stimulated with mitogens37 or when
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were used as responder
cells.34,40 Aggarwal et al.35 demonstrated that inhibition of the
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis abrogated the suppressive effect
of MSCs on T-cell proliferation. PGE2 was found to be constitutively
produced by MSCs, and the production was even enhanced upon
coculture of MSCs with PBMC.34 The attribution of PGE2 in the
suppression by MSC was conﬁrmed by Rasmusson et al.41 who
showed that indomethacin (an inhibitor of PGE2 synthesis) could
restore MSC-mediated suppression of T-cell proliferation, but only
when T cells were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin, and not in a
mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Another candidate mediator has
been suggested by Meisel et al.39 who described a role for indoleamine
2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the suppression by MSCs. The expression of
IDO in professional APCs catalyzes conversion of tryptophan to
kynurenine and has been identiﬁed as a major immunosuppressive
effector pathway that inhibits T-cell responses to autoantigens and
fetal alloantigens in vivo.42 In MSCs, the expression of IDO is not
constitutive but can be induced by IFN-g. Addition of tryptophan
restored T-cell proliferation suppressed by MSCs.39 However, trypto-
phan depletion was not responsible for the immunosuppressive effect
of MSCs when unfractionated PBMCs were used as responder cells.34
Many factors contribute to all these conﬂicting data. The kind of
responder population (unseparated mononuclear cells versus puriﬁed
T cells) as well as the stimulator used might alter the mechanism of
suppression by MSCs. More recently, other mediators in MSC-
mediated immunosuppression have been suggested. The human
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G protein, which is a nonclassical HLA
class I molecule, was found to mediate the suppressive effect
of MSCs through the induction of proliferation of regulatory
T cells.43 MSCs have also been reported to induce the production
of interleukin (IL)-10 by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC), which
in turn trigger the generation of regulatory T cells.44 In addition,
galectins are now emerging as a main regulator of MSC immuno-
suppressive function.45
Di Nicola et al.36 demonstrated that the suppressive effect of
hMSCs on mitogen-induced allogeneic T-cell proliferation is only
transient. This is in contrast to the ﬁndings on murine MSCs, which
induce a condition of anergy due to divisional arrest of T cells in the
G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle.46
Studies on the effect of MSCs on B-cell function have been
performed, although less frequent and leading to conﬂicting results.
In vitro experiments showed that B-cell proliferation was inhibited by
hMSCs through an arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. In
addition, hMSCs inhibited B-cell differentiation because immunoglo-
bulin M (IgM), IgG and IgA production was signiﬁcantly impaired, as
well as chemotaxis.47 By contrast, however, others have reported
stimulatory effects on in vitro activated B cells or plasma cells from
healthy donors or patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.48
Innate immune system
Natural killer (NK) cells are important effector cells of innate
immunity. These cells display spontaneous cytolytic activity against
cells that lack the expression of MHC class I molecules. Moreover, NK
cells are also important graft-versus-leukemia mediators.49 The
function of NK cells is regulated by the balance of the interaction
between activating and inhibiting signals with their cell surface
receptors. MSCs are known to express low levels of MHC class I
molecules, which makes them vulnerable for NK cell-mediated
killing.50 Nevertheless, MSCs are not lysed by freshly isolated
resting NK cells, even despite killer-cell Ig-like receptor mismatch
between MSC and NK cell donors. On the other hand, both
autologous and allogeneic MSCs can be successfully killed by
activated NK cells.51,52 This indicates that interactions between
MHC class I-speciﬁc inhibitory receptors on NK cells and MSCs
are not sufﬁcient to protect MSCs from lysis. It is also known that
MSCs express ligands for activating NK cell receptors on their surface,
like MIC-A (MHC class I-related chain A) and ULBPs (UL16-binding
protein; both ligands of NKG2D) as well as PVR (poliovirus receptor)
and Nectin-2 (both ligands of DNAM-1 (DNAX accessory molecule-1)).
In line with the previously mentioned upregulation of MHC class I on
MSCs upon culture with IFN-g, IFN-g-treated MSCs were less
susceptible to NK cell-mediated lysis.52
In addition, MSCs exert an inhibitory effect on NK cells, affecting
different aspects of NK cell function such as proliferation, cytotoxic
activity and cytokine production. MSCs inhibit the cytokine (IL-2
and IL-15)-driven proliferation of puriﬁed NK cells in a dose-
dependent way.52,53 Even though MSCs did not inhibit the NK cell-
mediated lysis of K562 cells, cytokine-stimulated NK cells cocultured
with MSCs exhibit a reduced cytolytic function against K562 cells.51
Sotiropoulou et al.54 could only demonstrate an impaired cytolytic
function against MHC class I positive tumor targets. Together with
the cytolytic activity, the IFN-g production by NK cells is impaired
after coculture with MSCs.53,54 As for the effect on T cells, the
mechanism of inhibition of MSCs on NK cells is not yet completely
unraveled. Different mediators like PGE2, IDO, TGF-b and HLA-G
have been proposed.53–55
DC have a critical role in adaptive immunity acting as the primary
APC to initiate a T-cell response. This process is essential to initiate
adaptive immunity against foreign antigens, but in case of allogeneic
transplantation with a non-HLA-identical donor, DC can promote
T-cell alloreactivity, leading to graft rejection. Therefore, the interac-
tion between DC and MSCs has been the subject of intensive research.
MSCs have been demonstrated to interfere with DC differentiation,
maturation and function. First, MSCs inhibit the differentiation of
monocytes to immature DC. This effect is reversible and mediated by

PGE2.56,57 Second, consistent data have shown that MSCs interfere
with DC maturation. It has been shown that DC cocultured with
MSCs exposed to maturation factors, such as lipopolysaccharide or
tumor-necrosis factor-a, did not express CD83 and failed to show
upregulation of maturation markers, such as MHC class II, CD40 or
CD86.56,58 In line with these ﬁndings, immature DC generated in the
presence of MSCs were strongly hampered in their ability to induce
activation of T cells. MSC cocultures induced an altered cytokine
expression, with reduced IL-12 and increased IL-10 production.35,58
Additionally, DC cultured with MSCs have been shown to induce
indirect expansion of regulatory T cells. Taken together, these results
suggest that MSCs suppress the differentiation of DC, resulting in the
formation of immature DC that exhibit a suppressor or inhibitory
phenotype.
IMMUNOGENICITY AND IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE CAPACITIES
OF HMAPCS
hMAPCs express low levels of MHC class I and LFA-3 (CD58) and are
negative for MHC class II, the costimulatory molecules CD80, CD86
and CD40 and the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion
molecule 1; CD54).59 Their immune phenotype depends, at least
in vitro, on the local inﬂammatory status of the environment.
hMAPCs do not induce proliferation of allogeneic T cells, and this
is consistent with their immune phenotypic characteristics, such as
the lack of expression of MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules
belonging to the B7-family. Pretreatment with IFN-g, as a model of
an inﬂammatory environment in which cells might be delivered
in vivo, led to the upregulation of MHC class I, MHC class II and
ICAM-I. However, despite this IFN-g pretreatment, hMAPCs still
failed to induce alloreactive T-cell proliferation. hMAPCs do not
induce production of T helper type 1 or 2 cytokines upon coculture
with allogeneic T cells, although low levels of activation markers on
responders T cells were induced.
So far, it has been shown that hMAPCs exert strong immunosup-
pressive effects on T-cell proliferation.59 Furthermore, the suppressive
effect was not inﬂuenced by MHC compatibility as both autologous
and third party stem cells showed similar suppression. These ﬁndings
are of great clinical relevance because hMAPCs are aimed at being
used as an off-the-shelf stem cell product for adoptive cellular
therapy. In addition, hMAPCs suppressed T-cell proliferation of
memory T cells upon stimulation with recall antigens and of
effector T cells during a secondary MLR. Even delayed addition of
hMAPCs to a MLR showed similar hMAPC-induced inhibitory effects
on alloreactive T cells. These data suggest that hMAPCs can also
suppress an ongoing immune response. Importantly, this ﬁnding
indicates that hMAPCs, when used in clinical settings, can be applied
not only for the prevention but also for the treatment of immune-
mediated diseases.
The suppressive effect of hMAPCs was not abrogated by pretreat-
ment with IFN-g. Hence, hMAPCs might remain immunosuppressive
when injected into an inﬂammatory environment in vivo. Third, it
was shown that although hMAPCs strongly suppress T-cell allogeneic
responses during a primary MLR, they do not prevent priming of
T cells, as suppressed T cells show similar secondary responses.
hMAPCs did not induce T-cell anergy. Di Nicola et al.36 however,
reported that the suppressive effect of hMSCs was reversible, but in
their study, T cells were stimulated with a mitogen during the primary
MLR instead of allogeneic PBMCs as in our experiments. In addition,
exogenous rIL-2 could not restore T-cell proliferation suppressed
by hMAPCs.
Subsequently, transwell experiments demonstrated that hMAPCs
still exert a suppressive effect, albeit lower, when they are separated
from the effector T cells via a membrane. This suggests that the
suppression is mediated, at least in part, via a soluble factor, which
blocks T-cell proliferation. This hypothesis is supported by the
immunosuppressive activity of added supernatants from hMAPC-
cultures. However, similar as was shown for hMSCs,34,36 the degree of
suppression was stronger when cell–cell contact was present. This
points to a parallel cell-contact-dependent suppressive activity or to
adhesion of immune cells to MAPCs, which strengthen their
suppressive function through soluble factors. Several candidate
molecules have been proposed as the soluble immunosuppressive
factor produced by hMSCs, although data are contradictory. hMAPCs
displayed increased IDO activity upon IFN-g pretreatment and
partially lost their suppressive effect on T-cell proliferation by
blocking IDO activity. This conﬁrmed that the hMAPC-mediated
suppressive effect is dependent, at least in part, on IDO activity.
Neither a role for PGE2 nor for TGF-b and IL-10 was found. Overall,
hMAPCs have immunosuppressive properties on T-cell alloreactivity
similar as hMSCs, at least in vitro (Figure 1).
CLINICAL EXPERIENCE ON IMMUNOMODULATION BY MSCS
Over the last two decades, MSCs have been brought into the clinic for
several purposes. Initially, MSCs were used in a number of studies to
create cartilage or bone tissue for cell replacement therapy because of
their potential to differentiate towards chondrocytes and osteocytes
in vivo.60 MSCs also contribute to the formation of vessels due to
their capacity to differentiate into vascular smooth muscle cells and
their secretion of ‘trophic’ factors that promote angiogenesis.61,62
Therefore, MSCs are currently being tested for their ability to aid
in the revascularization of ischemic tissues, such as the myocardium,
the brain and the peripheral limb.63–65
Subsequently, the use of MSCs gained interest in the ﬁeld
of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as it was shown
that in immunodeﬁcient mice hematopoietic engraftment could be
enhanced by co-transplanting MSCs.66,67 Furthermore, MSCs produce
several growth factors and cytokines that create a supportive
microenvironment of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.68

In the mid-nineties, the ﬁrst studies were performed to test the
safety of intravenous infusion of autologous hMSCs.69,70 In the
beginning, only patients with hematological malignancies and breast
cancer were studied because of the fear of adverse effects and tumor
formation. Researchers observed that autologous MSC infusion
at the time of HSCT was feasible and safe. Many studies followed
and so far there are no reports of any infusion-related toxicity or
ectopic tissue formation.
Meanwhile, others have studied the inﬂuence of MSCs on the
engraftment of HSCs in a BM graft. In 2002, Lee et al.71 were the ﬁrst
to report the use of allogeneic MSCs in a patient with a hematological
malignancy. They reported a patient with high-risk acute myeloid
leukemia who was transplanted with mobilized peripheral blood
hematopoietic stem cells in combination with BM-derived MSCs
from a HLA-haploidentical donor. The patient engrafted rapidly with
no acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and was
without any leukemia relapse at 31 months after transplantation.
The group of Le Blanc transplanted seven patients in a pilot study
together with HLA-identical MSCs in three cases and haploidentical
MSCs in four cases to enhance engraftment.72 Despite notable
differences in the patient population, sources of HSCs and MSCs
and HLA compatibility, all patients had full donor chimerism within
100 days. Ball et al.73 co-transplanted 14 pediatric patients with
hematological malignancy and immune deﬁciency or nonmalignant
disorder with haploidentical HSCs together with donor-derived
MSCs. Although graft failure in 47 historical controls was 15%, all
patients given MSCs showed sustained hematopoietic engraftment
without any adverse reaction. Haploidentical MSCs have also been
used to enhance hematopoietic reconstitution in a patient suffering
from severe aplastic anemia and a second patient with graft failure
secondary to incomplete engraftment after autologous HSCT for
acute myeloid leukemia.74,75 Despite back-up BM infusion, the graft
failure persisted in the latter patient, and this patient was infused with
MSCs 3 years after the initial HSCT. The authors observed
hematopoietic recovery of polymorphonuclear cells and platelets in
the absence of additional HSC support. The ﬁrst patient only showed
histological improvement in the BM after MSC administration.
Meuleman et al.76 transplanted six patients with graft failure after
allogeneic HSCT with MSCs without HSC co-infusion. Two of the
patients, both transplanted in ﬁrst complete remission, showed rapid
hematopoietic recovery, whereas other patients transplanted at later
stages of their disease were unresponsive.
As it became clear that MSCs have also immunomodulatory
properties, they are currently being evaluated in the clinic for the
prevention and treatment of GVHD, as well as for a number of auto-
immune disorders (for example, Crohn’s disease, multiple sclerosis,
and so on).77,78
In 2005, Lazarus et al.70 reported on a large multicenter clinical trial
with 46 patients with hematological malignancies receiving HLA-
identical sibling HSCs together with donor-derived MSCs. MSC
infusions were well tolerated, without any infusion-related adverse
event, but stromal cell chimerism could only be demonstrated in 2 of
19 examined patients at 6 and 18 months after transplantation.
Moderate-to-severe acute GVHD was seen in 28% of patients, and
chronic GVHD was observed in 61%. Later, in an open-label
randomized clinical trial, HLA-identical sibling-matched HSCs were
transplanted or cotransplanted with MSCs.79 They showed that
cotransplantation of MSCs with HSCs prevented GVHD (11% in
MSC group versus 53% in non-MSC group grades II-IV GVHD). On
the other hand, the relapse rate was obviously higher in the MSC
group than in the control group (60% versus 20%). More recently,
Liu et al.80 conducted a randomized controlled phase II study. A total
of 55 patients diagnosed with leukemia received MSCs at the same
time as haploidentical HSCT. Within 100 days in the treatment group,
platelet recovery was faster, incidence of acute GVHD higher (51.8%
versus 38.9%, respectively), whereas there was less chronic GVHD
(51.4% versus 74.1%, respectively). The overall survival rate did not
signiﬁcantly differ. The authors claim that the heavily pretreated
status of their patients together with the low dose of MSCs
(105 cellskgÀ1) are responsible for the absence of a beneﬁcial effect
of MSCs on the prevention of GVHD.
Based on the demonstration of the ability of MSCs to suppress the
proliferation of activated alloreactive T cells, MSCs were used for the
treatment of acute GVHD. In a landmark case report, Le Blanc et al.81
described the successful therapy of a 9-year-old boy with steroid-
resistant grade IV acute GVHD using haploidentical third-party
MSCs. Reversal of severe gut and liver GVHD was documented and
sustained complete response occurred after the second infusion of
MSCs. Subsequently, the group of Le Blanc treated eight additional
patients with treatment-resistant acute GVHD of which six patients
showed complete response after MSC infusion.82 Some less impressive
reports were published by Muller et al.83 who noted improvement of
GVHD in only two out of seven pediatric patients receiving
haploidentical parental MSCs. Von Bonin et al.84 reported beneﬁcial
effects of third-party MSCs expanded in platelet lysate-containing
medium in 2 of 13 adult patients with acute GVHD. Fang et al.85
reported on ﬁve of six steroid-refractory acute GVHD patients given
adipose-tissue-derived third-party MSCs. Those reports indicate that
patient population, timing of MSC infusion and culture and
expansion methods can largely inﬂuence outcomes. In 2008, the
results of a large multicenter non-randomized phase II trial of the
European Blood and Marrow Transplant MSC consortium, using the
same expansion protocol for the cells and common reagents, were
published and conﬁrmed a beneﬁcial effect.77 Fifty-ﬁve patients with
steroid-resistant severe acute GVHD were included. Patients received
one (n ¼ 27) or more (n ¼ 28) MSC infusions with a median dose
of 106 cellskgÀ1. MSCs were obtained from HLA-identical,
haploidentical or unrelated HLA-mismatched donors. A complete
response was seen in 30 patients (55%). Most interestingly, there was
no difference in response rates with respect to the source of MSCs.
This ﬁnding paves the way for the establishment of large banks of
MSCs enabling rapid availability without the need for HLA typing. In
2010, the abstract of Martin et al.86 reported on the ﬁrst randomized
placebo-controlled multicenter phase III trial for the treatment of
steroid-resistant acute GVHD using large scale expanded MSCs
derived from a healthy third-party donor (Prochymal). In total, 244
patients were enrolled, 163 patients received eight infusions of
Prochymal (dose 2 Â 106 cellskgÀ1) over a period of 4 weeks versus
81 patients who received placebo. Durable complete remission did not
differ between the study groups. However, subgroup analysis
paradoxically showed that patients with gut and liver involvement
had better response rates with Prochymal compared with patients
with skin involvement. Kebriaei et al.87 studied the use of MSCs to
treat newly diagnosed acute GVHD. Patients with grade II–IV were
randomized to receive 2 infusions of either low-dose (2 Â 106
cellskgÀ1) or high-dose (8Â 106 cellskgÀ1) third-party MSCs
(Prochymal) in combination with corticosteroids. The infusions were
well tolerated and the combination of high-dose corticosteroids and
Prochymal resulted in complete and partial response in 77% and 16%
of cases, respectively. There was no difference with respect to safety or
efﬁcacy between the low and high dose of MSCs. Recently, Prochymal
was used to treat 12 children with steroid-refractory grade III–IV

acute GVHD.88 They received 2 or 8 Â 106 cellskgÀ1 twice a week for
4 weeks. Partial and mixed responders received subsequent therapy
for 4 weeks. Clinical response, particularly in the gastro-intestinal
system, was seen in the majority of children (58% complete response,
17% partial response).
Taken together, all studies focusing on the treatment of acute
GVHD with MSC infusions could see a complete or partial response
in the majority of patients. There seemed to be no differences between
using low versus high doses of MSCs or between a single or multiple
infusions of MSCs. In addition, the HLA compatibility between MSC
donor and recipient was not of major importance.
As chronic GVHD still represents substantial morbidity and
mortality after allogeneic HSCT, the number of sporadic reports on
the use of MSCs to treat chronic GVHD are emerging.82,89 Weng
et al.90 reported on 19 patients with steroid-refractory chronic GVHD
treated with MSCs. Partial or complete response was seen in 74% of
the patients. The question whether the established mechanism of
graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) will remain in patients with chronic
GVHD who have been successfully treated needs to be further
addressed.
At the moment, GVHD is by far the most studied therapeutic
application for MSCs. However, clinical trials using MSCs to treat
other auto-immune diseases, for example, Crohn’s disease, multiple
sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and arthritis, are very
promising.63,91–93
CLINICAL EXPERIENCE ON IMMUNOMODULATION BY MAPCS
The extensive proliferation potential of hMAPCs allows banking of
large amounts of cells for their clinical use. Moreover, the immuno-
modulatory properties of hMAPCs make it possible to use them as a
universal donor. Therefore, a clinical grade, large-scale expanded
product has been developed based on the MAPC technology (Multi-
stem). Genomic and epigenetic stability of Multistem during long-
term culture expansion has been conﬁrmed, and preclinical studies
demonstrated the safety of administration in repeat dosing regimens
in BM transplant settings.94,95
Multistem is currently evaluated in a number of phase I/II clinical
trials in patients with stroke, acute myocardial infarction, inﬂamma-
tory bowel disease and for the prevention of GVHD in patients
undergoing BM transplantation.
Last year, clinical results from the phase I trial in acute myocardial
infarction demonstrated the safety of Multistem. Moreover, a bene-
ﬁcial effect was seen, in part, because of their ability to induce
neovascularization through secretion of trophic factors such as VEGF
(vascular endothelial growth factor), IL8 and CXCL5 (C-X-C motif
chemokine ligand 5).96,97 Earlier this year, the results of the phase I
trial for the prevention of GVHD were announced. Single dose and
repeat dose administration of MultiStem was well-tolerated, and a low
incidence of severe acute GVHD was observed.98
CONCLUSION
To bring stem cell-based adoptive therapy with hMAPCs to a
successful clinical application for the control of immunological
disorders, some main concerns need to be further addressed. A ﬁrst
major concern about the in vivo use of hMAPCs is that hMAPCs
might interfere with the normal protective immune responses against
pathogens. We observed that hMAPCs suppress T-cell proliferation
induced by recall antigens. This indicates that the adoptive treatment
with hMAPCs might render the host more vulnerable to infections.
However, different data derived from the clinical use of MSC therapy
in GVHD and allogeneic HSCT showed that anti-viral immune
reactions may normally occur following systemic administration.73,77
A second question regarding the adoptive transfer of immunosup-
pressive cells to prevent GVHD after HSCT involves the inﬂuence of
these immunosuppressive cells on the desired GVL effect. So far, this
has not been studied for hMAPCs. On the contrary and as mentioned
before, suppression of the GVL effect by hMSC therapy has been
reported. Ning et al.79 reported on a randomized clinical trial in
which patients with hematological malignancies received HSCs with
or without hMSCs. They observed that hMSC therapy had a
beneﬁcial effect on the occurrence of GVHD but was associated
with a higher relapse rate. This observation highlights the critical
effects of hMSC therapy on the balance between GVHD and GVL and
underscores the importance of studying further the inﬂuence of
hMAPCs on the GVL effect in allogeneic HSCT.
A third issue is the question of whether the immunosuppressive
capacities of hMAPCs will be inﬂuenced by other immunosuppressive
drugs, and this has thus far not been studied for hMAPCs. Standard
immunosuppressive treatment following allogeneic HSCT or organ
transplantation involves the administration of calcineurin inhibitors,
such as cyclosporine A (CSA), tacrolimus or mycophenolate mofetil
(MMF). These drugs might interfere with the immunosuppressive
effects of hMSCs after adoptive transfer. Le Blanc et al.37 were the ﬁrst
to show an in vitro synergistic effect of CSA on the hMSC-mediated
immunosuppression of T-cell reactivity. However, by contrast, Buron
et al.99 observed that CSA, tacrolimus and rapamycin antagonized
hMSC inhibitory effects, whereas MMF promoted the hMSC
inhibitory effects. In addition, Eggerhofer et al.100 demonstrated in
a rat model of heart transplantation that MSCs and MMF
synergistically prevented inﬁltration of APC and T cells into the
graft. By contrast, calcineurin inhibitors have been shown to abrogate
the immunosuppressive effect of rat MSC therapy.101 These
observations underline the need to study the appropriate drugs in
combination with the adoptive stem cell-mediated immunotherapy.
In conclusion, the use of stem cell-based immunotherapy is very
promising. So far, in vitro studies showed comparable suppressive
effects for hMSCs and hMAPCs, although the broader expansion
capacities of hMAPCs make them more attractive for clinical use.
