Abstract
Background: Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is a cytosolic enzyme highly expressed in hematopoietic precursors from cord
blood and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor mobilized peripheral blood, as well as in bone marrow from patients with acute
myeloblastic leukemia. As regards human normal bone marrow, detailed characterization of ALDH+ cells has been addressed by
one single study (Gentry et al, 2007). The goal of our work was to provide new information about the dissection of normal bone
marrow progenitor cells based upon the simultaneous detection by flow cytometry of ALDH and early hematopoietic antigens,
with particular attention to the expression of ALDH on erythroid precursors. To this aim, we used three kinds of approach: i)
multidimensional analytical flow cytometry, detecting ALDH and early hematopoietic antigens in normal bone marrow; ii)
fluorescence activated cell sorting of distinct subpopulations of progenitor cells, followed by in vitro induction of erythroid
differentiation; iii) detection of ALDH+ cellular subsets in bone marrow from pure red cell aplasia patients.
Results: In normal bone marrow, we identified three populations of cells, namely ALDH+CD34+, ALDH-CD34+ and
ALDH+CD34- (median percentages were 0.52, 0.53 and 0.57, respectively). As compared to ALDH-CD34+ cells, ALDH+CD34+
cells expressed the phenotypic profile of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells, with brighter expression of CD117 and
CD133, accompanied by lower display of CD38 and CD45RA. Of interest, ALDH+CD34- population disclosed a straightforward
erythroid commitment, on the basis of three orders of evidences. First of all, ALDH+CD34- cells showed a CD71bright, CD105+,
CD45- phenotype. Secondly, induction of differentiation experiments evidenced a clear-cut expression of glycophorin A
(CD235a). Finally, ALDH+CD34- precursors were not detectable in patients with pure red cell aplasia (PRCA).
Conclusion: Our study, comparing surface antigen expression of ALDH+/CD34+, ALDH-/CD34+ and ALDH+/CD34-
progenitor cell subsets in human bone marrow, clearly indicated that ALDH+CD34- cells are mainly committed towards
erythropoiesis. To the best of our knowledge this finding is new and could be useful for basic studies about normal
erythropoietic differentiation as well as for enabling the employment of ALDH as a red cell marker in polychromatic flow
cytometry characterization of bone marrow from patients with aplastic anemia and myelodysplasia.

Background
Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is a family of enzymes
involved in metabolism of aldehydes to their correspond-
ing carboxylic acids [1]. It plays an important role in
metabolism of vitamin A as well as in mechanisms of
resistance to alchylating agents, e.g. cyclophosphamide
[2]. For these reasons, ALDH is considered a protecting or
detoxifying enzyme, able to preserve stem cells from cyto-
toxic effects [2-4]. One of the accepted technologies to
identify human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is based
upon flow cytometry (FCM) detection of ALDH enzy-
matic activity [2]. In particular, Storms et al [2] designed a
substrate for ALDH, termed BODIPY aminoacetaldehyde
(BAAA), which consists of an aminoacetaldehyde moiety
bonded to the BODIPY fluorochrome. Once BAAA dif-
fuses freely into cells and it is converted by ALDH into
BODIPY aminoacetate (BAA), it remains trapped intracel-
lularly, so emitting green fluorescence [2].
Recently, the functional role of ALDH has been elucidated
in a study, in which the specific inhibitor of ALDH,
diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), was able to alter the
molecular and cellular mechanisms that control self-
renewal capacity of human HSC [5].
The evidence of ALDH involvement in the physiology of
HSC was further highlighted by a series of studies devoted
to purification/analysis of highly immature progenitor
cells, particularly in human cord blood (CB) as well as in
murine bone marrow (BM) [6-8]. The importance of
ALDH in human hematopoiesis was also testified by a
recent study in which the Authors tried to purify HSCs by
combining FCM cell sorting and Hoechst-33342 efflux
ability (the so called "Side Population") [9]. At variance
with previous findings obtained in mouse, human BM
hematopoietic cells able to exclude Hoechst-33342 did
not correspond to highly immature HSCs. On the other
hand, the Authors proposed that ALDH activity had to be
considered as the reference method for the detection of
immature HSCs in human BM, at the same time empha-
sizing the need of studies about expression pattern of
ALDH in comparison with other hematopoietic cell mark-
ers in this tissue [9].
Thanks to the relevant advances deriving from studies per-
formed by Gentry and coworkers [10,11], it was definitely
understood that ALDHbright cell population in banked
cord blood is highly enriched in hematopoietic colony
forming cells (CFC-H), compared to ALDHdim cell popu-
lations [10]. Moreover, cell sorting of ALDHbright cells in
human BM enables a marked enrichment of CFC-H as
well as of endothelial and fibroblast colonies [11].
Starting from these literature data, we carried out a com-
prehensive FCM characterization of human normal BM by
detecting ALDH in combination with other hematopoi-
etic cell markers. To this aim, we used a multidimensional
polychromatic approach, according to international
guidelines [12].
The goal of our work was to better define the expression
of surface antigens classically associated with early steps of
hematopoiesis such as CD38, CD45RA, CD71, CD105,
CD117 and CD133 in three BM cellular compartments
identified on the basis of ALDH and CD34 expression. We
were also interested to derive information about the pos-
sible erythroid lineage commitment of these identified
subpopulations of cells.
Methods
Normal BM samples were obtained, following informed
consent, from 23 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(age 20–81, median 45) who underwent BM aspiration in
the context of routine clinical practice. All samples
showed complete absence of neoplastic cells when ana-
lyzed by smear morphology, BM biopsy and FCM. Periph-
eral blood counts were in normal ranges. Thus, all BM
aspirates included in the study were operationally consid-
ered as normal. Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients before the study.
Three patients with pure red cell aplasia (PRCA, age 36–
40) were also included in the study. Also in this case, BM
samples were obtained following informed consent.
In the first phase of the study, we analyzed BM cells by
four-color FCM, detecting ALDH activity along with the
expression of a series of hematopoietic antigens. Directly
conjugated fluorescent antibodies were used reacting with
the following antigens: CD34, CD38, CD45, CD45RA,
CD71, CD105, CD117, CD133 and CD235a. In particu-
lar, PE conjugated monoclonal antibodies (MoAb)
against CD133, CD117, CD45RA and CD105 were
obtained from Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach, Ger-
many), Caltag (Burlingame, CA, USA), Beckman-Coulter
(Miami, FL, USA) and R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN,
USA), respectively. PE-conjugated anti-CD38, anti-CD34
and anti-CD235a, along with APC-conjugated anti-CD71,
PE-Cy7 conjugated anti CD34 and PerCP-conjugated anti-
CD45 were purchased from Becton Dickinson (San Jose,
CA, USA).
For all antibody staining experiments, 50 μl of whole BM
sample were incubated at 4°C for 30 min in the presence
of appropriate amount of MoAbs in PBS. Successively, the
mixtures were diluted 1:20 in ammonium chloride
(NH4Cl) lysing solution, then incubated at room temper-
ature for 5 minutes and finally washed with staining
media prior to flow cytometry analysis. In experiments
where BM samples were stained with BAAA and addi-

tional antibodies, the antibody reagents were incubated
with the cells at a concentration of 106 cells/ml for 15
minutes prior to BAAA staining. Cells with low side scatter
and high levels of BAAA staining were defined as "Side
Scatter Low ALDH Bright" (SSCloALDHbr) cells. ALDH
activity was assessed by the BODIPY-based ALDEFLUOR
assay (Becton Dickinson), according to the manufacturer
method. As negative control, we used DEAB, a potent
inhibitor of ALDH activity. Antibody and BAAA stained
cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson) equipped with a 488-nm argon laser
and a 635-nm red diode laser. BODIPY fluorescence was
excited at 488 nm and fluorescence emission was detected
using a standard fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) 530/
30 bandpass filter. Levels of CD antigen expression were
displayed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). The soft-
ware used for cytometric analysis was Paint-a-gate (Becton
Dickinson).
Cell sorting experiments were performed by the cell sorter
FACSAria (Becton Dickinson) equipped with blue, red,
and violet lasers. Dead cells were excluded by analyzing
forward scatter (FSC) vs side scatter (SSC) dot plots. Dou-
blets were excluded by FSC-H vs FSC-A dot plots. Three
populations of cells were sorted: ALDH-CD34+,
ALDH+CD34+ and ALDH+CD34-. In all experiments,
purity was higher than 95% of desired cells.
Immunophenotyping of patients with PRCA was per-
formed by the flow cytometer FACSCanto (Becton Dickin-
son), by using a 5-colour strategy (1st channel: ALDH; 2nd
channel: CD235a-PE; 3rd channel: CD45-PerCP; 4th chan-
nel: CD71-APC; 5th channel: CD34-PE-Cy7).
Induction of differentiation studies were performed
according to Malik et al (13). In brief, ALDH+CD34+ and
ALDH+CD34- cells were purified from three different nor-
mal bone marrow samples and were cultured at a density
of 105 cells/mL in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium
(IMDM; GIBCO, Grand Island, NY), 1% deionized bovine
serum albumin (BSA; Sigma, St Louis, MO), 10-4 mol/L 2-
mercaptoethanol, 10-6 mol/L hydrocortisone, 100 U/mL
penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine with
the following recombinant cytokines: 10 U/mL of recom-
binant human (rH) Epo (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA),
0.001 ng/mL rH granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulat-
ing factor (GM-CSF), and 0.01 U/mL rH interleukin-3 (IL-
3; Immunex Corp, Seattle, WA) and incubated in 5% CO2
at 37°C. We strictly followed the indications of the
reported method [13], culturing ALDH+CD34+ cells and
ALDH+CD34- cells in the aforementioned culture condi-
tions for 4 days in order to demonstrate our hypothesis
that ALDH+CD34- cells were committed erythroid precur-
sors.
Descriptive statistics included medians, lowest and high-
est values, and 95% CI for the medians. Statistical signifi-
cance was assessed by paired Wilcoxon test.
Results
Intracellular fluorescence staining of ALDH was com-
bined with SSC with the aim of facilitating the identifica-
tion of ALDH+ stem cells and progenitor cells. In facts, it
is well known that HSCs and progenitors typically have
low SSC on FACS analysis [14]. A population of cells with
low SSC and high levels of BAAA staining (SSCloALDHbr)
was evident in BM aspirates of all the 23 subjects studied
(Fig 1, panel B). In contrast, when BM aspirate was stained
simultaneously with BAAA and DEAB, a potent inhibitor
of ALDH, no SSCloALDHbr cells were noted (Fig 1, panel
A). The absence of ALDH staining in the presence of
ALDH inhibitor confirms that the presence of SSCloALD-
Hbr population is specifically due to high-level ALDH
activity in these cells.
In order to better define the BM cellular compartments in
terms of ALDH and CD34 expression, we performed a
multimensional FCM analysis using the Paint-a-gate soft-
ware (Becton Dickinson). We identified three distinct
populations of cells in all 23 samples analyzed: ALDH+/
CD34-, ALDH-/CD34+ and ALDH+/CD34+. In particular,
in figure 2 (panel A) we first imposed a green gate on
ALDH+ cells, then a red gate on CD34+ cells (panel B) and
finally the events falling at the same time in the green as
well as red gates were automatically depicted in yellow by
the software. The median percentages of ALDH+/CD34-
(green), ALDH-/CD34+ (red) and ALDH+/CD34+ (yellow)
cells were 0.57% (95% CI for the median 0.40 to 0.76),
0.53% (0.40 to 1.09) and 0.52% (0.24 to 0.68), respec-
tively. The denominator of these percentages was com-
posed by the entire population of nucleated bone marrow
cells following to NH4Cl lysis of mature erythrocytes.
Note that the green population (ALDH+CD34-) was
simultaneously negative for CD34 and CD45 (Fig 2, pan-
els C and D, respectively).
Starting from this point, the work was carried out with the
aim of identifying the immunophenotype of the three
aforementioned cell populations.
Firstly, we focused on differential expression of CD38,
CD45RA, CD117 and CD133 in CD34+ALDH+ and
CD34+ALDH- cells (Table 1). As compared to
CD34+ALDH- cells, CD34+ALDH+ cells were characterized
by lower expression of activation-differentiation antigens
CD38 (median values 154 vs 253, p < 0.01) and CD45RA
(39 vs 140, p < 0.01) and by higher expression of stem cell
antigen CD117 (43 vs 23, p < 0.01) and CD133 (15 vs 9,
p < 0.01).

Taken together, ALDH, CD133 and CD117 compose an
immunophenotypic mosaic related to an undifferentiated
status, while CD38 and CD45RA expression indicates a
higher degree of cell maturation. To confirm this view, fig-
ure 3 shows the inverse correlation between CD38 and
ALDH. Interestingly, in all cases studied the highest
expression of ALDH strictly corresponded to the lowest
expression of CD38.
Our attention was focused on ALDH+/CD34- cell popula-
tion. As shown in Figure 4, ALDH+/CD34- cells (depicted
in blue) were characterized by CD105 bright expression
(panel A) accompanied by CD71 high expression level
(panel B). Moreover, CD105 and CD71 antigens were
tightly co-expressed (Fig. 4, panel C) and overall popula-
tion defined by ALDH, CD105 and CD71 positivity was
also characterized by high volume, as detected by forward
scatter measurement (FSC, Fig. 4, panel D).
Figure 5 shows in a representative case (we studied three
normal BM samples) that isolated ALDH+CD34- cells are
committed towards erythropoiesis, since they can be eas-
ily induced to express GPA/CD235a by a brief cell culture
(4 days) with a medium containing erythropoietin, GM-
CSF and IL3. As shown in the figure, while ALDH+CD34+
cells (panel A) remained GPA-negative following the
exposure to the aforementioned agents, ALDH+CD34-
cells (panel B) were clearly induced to differentiate into
GPA-positive cells.
Figure 6 is the final demonstration, obtained in a disease
model, that ALDH+CD34- cells belong to an early eryth-
roid subpopulation. In facts, PRCA patients are com-
pletely deprived of this cell subpopulation. Figure 6 shows
one representative experiment (we studied three patients)
in which normal bone marrow contains a population of
ALDH+CD34- cells (panel A), which is also CD71bright
(panel C). By contrast, PRCA bone marrow is almost com-
pletely deprived of ALDH+CD34-CD71bright cells (panel B
and D).
Discussion
In spite of the existence of a series of studies describing
ALDH expression in human CB [4,6,8,10], peripheral
blood stem cells [3] and even acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) BM cells [1] data aiming to characterize normal
BM ALDH+ cells are still limited to a few recent reports
[9,11].
The use of NH4Cl lysed, unseparated bone marrow for
immunophenotypic studies is strongly recommended by
clinico-hematological guidelines [12,15]. In this work we
decided to follow these recommendations, so that BM
samples were not processed by density gradient separa-

tion to the aim of avoiding unwanted selection of cell sub-
sets, and, at the same time, of not interfering with assay
interpretation [12].
Our interest in ALDH detection relies on the considera-
tion that FCM based ALDH activity assessment is
exploited in order to evidence a conserved stem cell func-
tion, rather than to merely identify a stem cell antigen
[16].
The first result of this study, based upon the simultaneous
identification of ALDH activity and a detailed immu-
nophenotype profile, is that the contemporary expression
of CD34 and high levels of ALDH is able to identify prim-
itive BM hematopoietic progenitors, clearly expressing
high amounts of CD117 and CD133 as well as low
amounts of CD38 and CD45RA. These data are in keeping
with findings reported by Hess, Pearce and Gentry groups
on CB cells [4,9,10]. They found that ALDHbright cells were
able to give multilineage hematopoietic repopulation
and, when compared to their ALDHlo counterparts, they
expressed higher amounts of CD133, CD31, CD117 and
lower amounts of CD38 [4,9,10].
Our study shares some arguments with the work by Gen-
try et al on human bone marrow [11]. Similarly to our
work, these Authors characterized ALDHbright cells with a
series of MoAbs directed to surface antigens, e.g. CD34,
CD117, CD133, CD105, CD166, CD127, CD38, HLA-DR
and CD45. Nevertheless, there is one difference between
our study and Gentry's work. While Gentry and coworkers
[11] used a 3-color plus 7-AAD (7-amino-actinomycin D)
scheme, thus comparing the expression of ALDH with 2
surface antigens, we combined ALDH analysis with 3 sur-
face antigens. Such a multidimensional strategy allowed
us to obtain the core finding of our work, i.e. the detection
of a consistent population of cells characterized by the
simultaneous presence of CD105, CD71 and ALDH, in
the absence of CD34. In this regard, if ALDH+/CD34- cell
subset may also contain a very rare, primitive stem cell
remains to be demonstrated and it is conceivable that a
specific marker for the selection of human CD34-negative
stem cells needs to be identified before definite conclu-
sions are made, as suggested by other research groups
[9,17,18]. However, in our study the majority of cells we
identified by ALDH+/CD34-/CD45- immunophenotype
appeared to be committed, lineage antigen positive, non-
stem cells. In particular, we demonstrated that these cells
display precise erythroid features, i.e. CD105 and
CD71bright expression in all 23 normal BM samples ana-
lyzed. The expression of these two antigens along with
CD34 negativity is consistent with erythroid precursors
[19,20]. This finding is intriguing because little direct
information is available about the phenotypic features of
erythroid precursors, as these cells are both sparse and dif-
ficult to isolate in sufficient numbers to be studied [19].
In order to further characterize ALDH+CD34- cells we per-
formed cell sorting isolation of ALDH+CD34+ and
ALDH+CD34- cell subsets, followed by short term cell cul-
ture experiments in which we were able to induce the
expression of GPA only on ALDH+CD34- cells. These
experiments, which strictly followed indications by Malik
et al [13] who recapitulated the entire erythropoietic proc-
ess in vitro, were the proof of eythroid commitment of
ALDH+CD34- cells in normal bone marrow.
We also decided to further confirm erythroid commit-
ment of ALDH+CD34- cells in a disease model. Interest-
ingly, we demonstrated that three PRCA patients were
completely devoid of this cellular subset, thus allowing us
to hypothesize the use of this cytometric approach as a
diagnostic tool in this kind of disease.
Taken together, our data indicate ALDH as a suitable tool
to identify early steps of erythropoiesis as well as to isolate
erythroid precursors by cell sorting. Moreover, given the
lack of sufficient numbers of reliable erythroid markers in
diagnostic panels [15,21] ALDH could also have possible
application in the field of PRCA and myelodysplasia FCM
diagnosis.
Analysis of CD34+ gated cells shows that CD38 expressionis inversely correlated with ALDH positivityFigure 3
Analysis of CD34+ gated cells shows that CD38
expression is inversely correlated with ALDH positiv-
ity. Cells with brightest expression of ALDH are completely
negative for CD38 (red cells). This subset corresponds to
very early CD34+ cells. As cell differentiation proceeds, cells
lose ALDH and acquire CD38 (blue cells). Green cells repre-
sent an intermediate stage.

Finally, a possible application of ALDH detection by FCM
to the field of acute leukemia may derive from the study
of Cheung et al [1], in which the authors described ALDH
expression in AML. They noted that in AML patients in
complete remission, a relevant population of cells charac-
terized by high ALDH activity remained [1]. In this regard,
our data concerning multidimensional expression profile
of ALDH combined with other hematopoietic antigens in
normal BM precursors could represent the basis to distin-
guish by FCM leukemic from normal ALDH+ cells.
Conclusion
In this study we demonstrated that ALDH+CD34- cells are
mainly committed towards erythropoiesis. This finding is
new and could be relevant for human physiology studies
about erythropoietic differentiation as well as for propos-
ing the utilization of ALDH as a red cell marker in multi-
dimensional flow cytometry characterization of bone
marrow from patients with aplastic anemia (mainly
PRCA) and myelodysplasia.

Demonstration that ALDH+CD34- cells are committed toward erythropoiesis. Panel A: sorted ALDH+CD34+ cell
fraction, induced to differentiate for 4 days in the presence of erythropoietin, GM-CSF and IL3. Panel B: sorted ALDH+CD34-
cell fraction, induced to differentiate in the same conditions. These results represent a typical experiment of the 3 performed.

Demonstration that PRCA patients are devoid of ALDH+CD34- cell population. Panel A: expression of ALDH and
CD34 in normal bone marrow. Panel B: expression of ALDH and CD34 in PRCA bone marrow (note the striking depletion of
ALDH+CD34- cell population). Panel C: CD71 expression on ALDH+CD34- cells in human normal bone marrow. Panel D:
absence of CD71 expression in PRCA bone marrow.
