Abstract
Introduction: Bilateral macular hemorrhage is a rare ocular finding and to the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report of such hemorrhages as a presentation of drug-induced anemia.
Case presentation: We describe the case of a 14-year-old Caucasian boy who presented with a
toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis and was treated with sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine. Three months
later, he presented with a bilateral macular hemorrhage as a complication of a toxic induced
anemia.
Conclusion: Our patient presented with toxic anemia secondary to the treatment of a very
common disease, ocular toxoplasmosis. Prophylactic use of folinic acid could prevent such
complications but in many cases, it is not prescribed owing to its cost or is mistakenly substituted
with folic acid, which does not present as a valid substitute.
Introduction
Toxoplasmosis is a very common usually benign infection
that becomes clinically important in the case of pregnant
women, immunocompromised patients or when it affects
the eye. Up to 19% of infected patients can present with
ocular retinochoroiditis at some point after being
infected. The patients with ocular toxoplasmosis are usu-
ally treated with an association of sulfadiazine/pyrimeth-
amine or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 4 to 6 weeks
[1,2].
Case presentation
A 14-year-old boy presented to the emergency room with
a 1-week history of sore throat, fever and malaise. He had
been diagnosed with ocular toxoplasmosis 3 months
before presentation and treated with sulfadiazine (4 g/

day), pyrimethamine (25 mg/day) and folinic acid (7.5
mg/day). To note, even though folinic acid was pre-
scribed, the patient was taking folic acid instead because
the latter is much less expensive. He had been using the
medication for two and a half months, until 15 days
before coming to the emergency room. Personal and
familial past medical history were unremarkable. As the
blood work revealed anemia and leucopenia (Hb: 4.2 gm/
dL; 2100 leukocytes/μL [300 neutrophils]; 348,000 plate-
lets/mL), the boy was admitted for further hematologic
investigation.
The patient presented with an intense anemia and severe
neutropenia. Bone marrow aspirate was normocellular
with hyperplasia of the erythrocytic lineage, with mega-
loblastic and dysplasic elements. The granulocytic lineage
showed hypocellularity and dysgranulopoiesis with mat-
uration asynchronism. The megakaryocytic lineage was
preserved and there was a low-grade plasmacytosis of
6.2% of the total cells. These findings were compatible
with drug-induced bone marrow toxicity in response to
pyrimethamine or sulfur.
Four days after admission, the patient complained of poor
vision in the left eye. Visual acuity was 20/30 in the right
eye and counting fingers (CF) at 1 meter in the left. Pupil-
lary reaction, ocular motility, intra-ocular pressure (12
mmHg AO), and anterior segment were normal. Fundus
exam of the right eye revealed sub-retinal hemorrhages,
intra-retinal hemorrhages with a white center and a retin-
ochoroidal scar inferior to the optic nerve head. This reti-
nal scar was compatible with the toxoplasmic infection 3
months before. Fundus exam of the left eye showed a
macular hemorrhage. It was decided to observe and ele-
vated decubitus was recommended so that the blood
could sediment and clear the visual axis.
Two days later, his visual acuity dropped to CF at 1 m in
the right eye, without anterior segment abnormalities. Vis-
ual acuity in the left eye had improved to 20/60 at that
time. Fundus exam revealed bilateral macular hemor-
rhages and some small preretinal hemorrhages in the
mid-periphery of the right eye (Figures 1 and 2). At that
point, the patient's blood work revealed an improvement
in the anemia and leucopenia (Hb: 10.8 gm/dL; 3600 leu-
cocytes/μL; 268,000 platelets/mL).
Again elevated decubitus was recommended. After 4 days,
the visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye and 20/30 in
the left eye, with improvement in the retinal hemorrhages
and inferior deposition of the preretinal blood in both
eyes, clearing the visual axis. After 4 weeks of follow-up,
visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes.
Discussion
The rare, classically called "sub-hyaloid" or "preretinal"
macular hemorrhage is actually located between the
neuro fiber layer and the inner limiting membrane.
Causes of this hemorrhage include Valsalva maneuver,
diabetic retinopathy, retinal branch vein occlusion, rup-
tured macro-aneurism of the retina and shaken baby syn-
drome. Other rare causes include thrombocytopenia
secondary to bone marrow aplasia, leukemia, auto-
immune hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia secondary to
drug toxicity, severe head trauma, bleeding secondary to

intercourse and intraocular pressure variation during
refractive surgery (LASIK). Bilateral macular hemorrhages
are even more uncommon, with a few reports associated
with cases of head trauma, hemolytic anemia and throm-
bocytopenia [3].
In our report, the patient presented the hemorrhage while
admitted in the hospital and being constantly evaluated.
Causes for Valsalva retinopathy were excluded and ane-
mia was the most likely etiology, given that he did not
present with thrombocytopenia during his time at the
hospital. The explanation for retinal hemorrhages in the
presence of anemia without thrombocytopenia is not
clear. Factors such as anoxia, venous stasis, angiospasm,
increased capillary permeability, and thrombocytopenia
have been implicated in the pathogenesis of anemic retin-
opathy [4].
The hematologic investigation, including bone marrow
aspirate, was compatible with drug-induced bone marrow
toxicity in response to pyrimethamine or sulfur [5-8].
Both drugs interfere with the conversion of folate to its
active form, tetrahydrofolate, essential for DNA synthesis.
The inadequate DNA replication leads to deficient hemat-
opoietic cell division, with megaloblastic features, and
granulocytic alterations described above. Clinically,
patients present with anemia which may be accompanied
by leucopenia and thrombocytopenia.
Thirty days following the cessation of the medication, the
patient improved, supporting our hypothesis of drug-
induced medullary toxicity.
Conclusion
Bilateral macular hemorrhages secondary to anemia are
rare and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report of subhyaloid hemorrhage secondary to drug-
induced bone marrow toxicity.
The use of folinic acid in the treatment of toxoplasmosis
could prevent complications from the use of dihydro-
folate reductase inhibitors such as pyrimethamine but is
expensive and not always provided by public health sys-
tems in different countries. The use of folic acid should
not be considered as an alternative because it does not
prevent drug-induced toxicity. Physicians should be aware
of this rare but serious complication of ocular toxoplas-
mosis treatment.
