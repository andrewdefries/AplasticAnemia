Abstract
Background: Secondary bone marrow (BM) myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are increasingly common, as a result of radio
or chemotherapy administered to a majority of cancer patients. Patients with secondary MDS have increased BM cell
apoptosis, which results in BM dysfunction (cytopenias), and an increased risk of developing fatal acute leukemias. In the
present study we asked whether TNF-a, known to regulate cell apoptosis, could modulate the onset of secondary MDS.
Principal Findings: We show that TNF-a is induced by irradiation and regulates BM cells apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In
contrast to irradiated wild type (WT) mice, TNF-a deficient (TNF-a KO) mice or WT mice treated with a TNF-a-neutralizing
antibody were partially protected from the apoptotic effects of irradiation. Next we established a 3-cycle irradiation
protocol, in which mice were sub-lethally irradiated once monthly over a 3 month period. In this model, irradiated WT mice
presented loss of microsatellite markers on BM cells, low white blood cell (WBC) counts, reduced megakaryocyte (MK) and
platelet levels (thrombocytopenia) and macrocytic anemia, phenoypes that suggest the irradiation protocol resulted in BM
dysfunction with clinical features of MDS. In contrast, TNF-a KO mice were protected from the irradiation effects: BM cell
apoptosis following irradiation was significantly reduced, concomitant with sustained BM MK numbers and absence of other
cytopenias. Moreover, irradiated WT mice with long term ($5 months) BM dysfunction had increased BM angiogenesis,
MMPs and VEGF and NFkB p65, suggestive of disease progression.
Conclusion: Taken together, our data shows that TNF-a induction following irradiation modulates BM cell apoptosis and is a
crucial event in BM dysfunction, secondary MDS onset and progression.

Introduction
Tumour Necrosis Factor-a (TNF-a) is a pro-inflammatory
cytokine secreted by activated macrophages and T lymphocytes,
but also by keratinocytes and fibroblasts [reviewed in 1]. Its role in
inflammatory processes is based both on tissue destruction and
subsequent recovery of tissue homeostasis [2]. However, its role in
carcinogenesis is more controversial, since it can selectively cause
apoptosis of tumour endothelial cells via a caspase cascade
[reviewed in 3], but can also promote tumour growth and
metastasis, probably via nuclear factor NF-kB activation [2;
reviewed in 1]. The link between chronic inflammation and cancer
is well demonstrated in the TNF-a-deficient mice model, which is
resistant to skin carcinogenesis. Conversely, the presence of TNF-a
on wild-type (WT) animals increased their susceptibility to tumour
promotion [4]. TNF-a deficiency was associated with reduced
MMP9 expression, which correlated with reduced keratinocyte
migration, limiting skin tumour development [5]. In addition,
several studies have shown a role for TNF-a-induced MMPs in
tumour progression and invasiveness [6–8].
TNF-a has also been implicated in BM diseases such as Fanconi
anemia [9,10], aplastic anemia [11,12] or myelodisplasic syn-
dromes (MDS). Bone marrow failure in MDS involves apoptosis
induction, which may involve TNF-a [13]; persistent BM
dysplasia following benzene exposure has also been associated
with TNF-a polymorphisms [14]. Nevertheless, the therapeutic
efficacy of anti-TNF-a approaches, tested in patients with de novo,
or primary, MDS, has been relatively modest [15–17].
Despite some evidence pointing for a putative role of TNF-a in
regulating BM disease onset, studies exploiting its involvement in
secondary (irradiation-induced) BM failure/MDS are lacking, and
were the subject of the present study. Patients with secondary

MDS (which develop following chemotherapy or radiotherapy for
other cancers) have worse prognosis than primary MDS [18], and
as such it represents a serious complication of cancer treatments.
The data shown in this report identify TNF-a as a key cytokine in
the BM microenvironment, important for cell apoptosis, sensitivity
to irradiation, BM dysfunction and secondary MDS onset and
progression. Anti-TNF strategies may be beneficial for the
treatment of subsets of patients with BM dysfunction/secondary
MDS.
Results
Single Irradiation Induces BM Cell Apoptosis and TNF-a
Production
We reasoned an increase in BM TNF-a might correlate with
BM cell apoptosis induced by irradiation. To test this hypothesis,
we analysed the effects of sub-lethal irradiation in BM cell
turnover over a 3 day (72 h) period (‘‘short-term irradiation
effect’’). As shown in Figure 1A, BM CD11b+ (myeloid) and Sca1+
(haematopoietic precursors) cell apoptosis increases in the initial
18 hours following irradiation, decreasing to control (non-
irradiated) levels by 72 hours. As determined by RQ-PCR, the
BM levels of TNF-a show a similar trend, increasing in the initial
18 hours and returning to control levels after 72 hours (Figure 1B).
TNF-a Induces In Vitro BM Cell Apoptosis
Next we tried to find a causal relationship between the increase
in TNF-a levels and the incidence in BM cell apoptosis following
irradiation. For this purpose, we irradiated whole BM mononu-
clear cells and BM stromal cells in vitro, and measured the levels of
TNF-a released into the culture supernatants by ELISA. As shown
in Figure 2A, irradiation induces TNF-a production by whole BM
and BM stroma.
Next, we hypothesized that TNF-a might be responsible for the
incidence in BM cell apoptosis, and thus neutralizing its activity
might exert a protective effect. Therefore, we exposed subsets of
BM cells to the supernatants described earlier, and tested the
protective effects of adding a TNF-a neutralizing antibody. As
shown in Figure 2B, cells treated with supernatants obtained from
irradiated BM cells show a significantly higher apoptotic index
Figure 1. Irradiation induces BM cell apoptosis which correlates with an increase in TNFa expression. A. Flow cytometry analysis of WT
mouse BM cells shows a rapid increase in CD11b+ and Sca1+ cells apoptosis 6-12 hours after sub-lethal irradiation, returning to normal levels after
72 hrs. B. TNF-a quantification by RQ-PCR on the same samples indicates a rapid increase in TNF-a mRNA after irradiation. The results shown were
obtained from 8 independent experiments using 6 animals per time point.

than those treated with the TNF-a neutralizing antibody and
exposed to the same supernatants. (p,0.05 for Sca1+ and
CD11b+ cells). These experiments suggest that TNF-a released
into culture supernatants of irradiated BM cells induces BM cell
apoptosis in vitro. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude other undis-
closed factor(s) may also promote BM cell apoptosis in response to
the irradiation stimulus.
TNF-a KO Mice Are Partially Resistant to the Apoptotic
Effects of Irradiation
To test the importance of TNF-a in BM apoptosis following
irradiation in vivo, we compared the ‘‘short term irradiation effects’’
in wild type (WT) and TNF-a deficient (KO) mice BM content. As
shown in Figure 3A, as a result of cell apoptosis, the BM cell
number decreases significantly 3 days after sub-lethal irradiation,
returning to control levels by 7 days. In accordance with the in vitro
results, irradiated TNF-a KO mice were partially resistant to the
apoptotic effects of irradiation (the number of BM cells is
significantly higher in TNF-a KO mice BM 3 days after
irradiation, p,0.05).
To overcome possible differences between the BM microenvi-
ronment of TNF-a KO and WT mice, we also tested the effects of
irradiation in the BM content of WT mice treated with anti-TNF-
a Ab. In Figure 3B, a marked decrease in BM cell numbers (higly
significant: p,0.02) was observed in untreated (control) mice
24 hours after irradiation, comparing with Ab-treated animals. In
parallel with these results, flow cytometry analysis for apoptotic
cells showed that the number of Sca1/Annexin V- and CD11b/
Annexin V-positive cells is significantly higher (p,0.01) in control
mice in comparison with anti-TNF-a treated mice, confirming the
apoptotic effect of TNF-a in both precursor and mature BM cells
(Figure 3C). For the other time-points, also a minor protection
from irradiation-induced apoptosis is observed in anti-TNF-a
treated mice (data not shown).
Taken together, these experiments suggest irradiation induces
TNF-a production in the BM, and that the released TNF-a is

partially responsible for the increase in BM cell apoptosis following
irradiation.
3-Cycle Irradiation Protocol Induces BM Dysfunction,
Suggestive of MDS
Next, we developed a 3-cycle irradiation protocol (to test the
‘‘long term effects of irradiation’’), and characterized its effects in
inducing BM dysfunction. First, we showed the irradiation protocol
induces loss of microsatellite markers by BM cells, suggesting it had
carcinogenic/transforming capacity (Supplementary Figure S1).
Concerning the haematological phenotype induced by the irradi-
ation protocol, as shown in Fig 4, three months after the last
irradiation, 3x irradiated mice showed a significant decrease in
circulating white blood cells (WBC), platelets and red blood cells
Figure 3. Sub-lethal irradiation reduces the number of total BM cells, an effect partially dependent on TNF-a. A. WT and TNF-a KO
mice were sub-lethally irradiated and the total number of BM cells was counted as explained in Methods. As shown, TNF-a KO mice were more
resistant to the apoptotic effects of irradiation. On day 3 following irradiation, the number of total BM cells is significantly higher in TNF-a KO mice
than in WT mice. The results shown were obtained from two independent experiments, using 12 animals per experimental group and 3 animals per
time point. *: p,0.05. B. WT mice were injected with PBS (control) or with antibody anti-TNFa prior to sub-lethal irradiation and total BM cells were
counted. Like for TNF-a KO mice, anti-TNFa neutralized mice were more resistent to irradiation; here, the number of total BM cells is significantly
higher (*: p,0.02) by 24 hours after irradiation than in controls. C. The percentage of apoptotic cells 24 hours after irradiation was obtained in
control and neutralized mice by flow cytometry. Both precursor (Sca1+) and myeloid (CD11b+) cells were protected from irradiation-induced
apoptosis in the anti-TNF-a treated mice, where the number of cells positive for annexin V is lower than in the controls. *: p,0.01 for CD11b+; for
Sca1+ a p value could not be calculated due to the absence of Sca1+Annexin+ cells in neutralized mice. The results shown in B and C were obtained
from one experiment, using 12 animals per experimental group and 3 animals per time-point.

(RBC). In addition, 3x irradiated mice showed a significant increase
in MCH-pg Hemoglobin per RBC (Figure 4D), a phenotype usually
seen in macrocytic anemia. Taken together, the concomitant
clinical presentation of cytopenias, thrombocytopenia and anemia,
and the incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities in 3x irradiated
mice, strongly suggests this may be considered a model of BM
dysfunction with clinical features of secondary MDS.
TNF-a KO Mice Are Resistant to the Irradiation-Induced
BM Dysfunction
Having shown TNF-a was involved in the regulation of BM
apoptosis following short-term irradiation, next we tested the
importance of TNF-a in our irradiation-induced model of BM
dysfunction/secondary MDS. As shown in Figure 5A and B, BM cell
apoptosis increased in 3x irradiated WT mice, but was significantly
reduced in 3x irradiated TNF-a KO (p,0.05). Similarly, the
number of MK in BM of 3x irradiated WT mice decreased
significantly (correlating with the reduction in platelet levels,
Figure 4), but was sustained in 3x irradiated TNF-a KO mice
(Fig. 6A, B; the difference in the number of BM MK is significant,
p,0.05). Circulating WBC and RBC were also higher in 3x
irradiated TNF-a KO compared to 3x irradiated WT mice (data not
shown). Taken together, these data suggest that TNF-a KO mice are
resistant to the effects of long-term irradiation. While irradiated WT
mice develop BM dysfunction with clinical features of MDS,
irradiated TNF-a KO mice have sustained BM cell numbers,
including MK and unchanged haematological parameters.
WT Mice with Prolonged BM Dysfunction/MDS Present
Increased BM Angiogenesis, MMPs and NFkB
MDS patients are at a higher risk of developing secondary
acute leukemias [19]. In our model of irradiation-induced BM

dysfunction/secondary MDS, a proportion (40%) of 3x
irradiated WT mice succumb approximately 6-8 months after
the last irradiation (data not shown). We characterized the BM
of mice that presented an MDS-like phenotype beyond 5
months after the last irradiation, and compared it to control
(non-irradiated) WT and TNF-a KO mice BM. As shown in
Figure 7A, 3x irradiated WT mice had increased BM
microvessel density (more and dilated vessels), indicative of
increased angiogenesis. In contrast, TNF-a KO BM had
significantly less microvessel density, as shown by the expression
and quantification of basement membrane markers laminin and
collagen IV (Figure 7B, p,0.05). The BM of 3xirradiated mice
also presented increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Figure 8A),
VEGF and NFkB p65 expression (Figure 8B), while in control
WT or TNF-a KO mice these parameters remain unchanged.
In addition, ex-vivo TNF-a treatment of isolated BM cells
induced VEGF production (data not shown). Taken together,
these data suggest that in 3xirradiated mice sustained BM TNF-
a levels induce MMP activity, VEGF production/release and
NFkB expression, thereby promoting disease progression.
Discussion
In the present report we exploited the possibility that
irradiation, known to induce BM malignant transformation,
namely secondary acute myeloid leukemias [20] and MDS [21],
might act as an inducer of TNF-a in the BM microenvironment,
and studied the consequences of such an increase in the incidence
of BM cell apoptosis and subsequent onset of BM dysfunction.
First, we observed that the effects of whole body ‘‘short term
irradiation’’, resulting in BM cell turnover and subsequent
recovery, correlated with the levels of BM TNF-a. Moreover, in
vitro exposure to supernatants from irradiated BM stroma, treated
or untreated with a neutralizing antibody to TNF-a, demonstrated
the TNF-a released in response to irradiation is partially
responsible for BM cell apoptosis induction. Other studies have
highlighted the role of TNF-a signalling in hematopoietic
progenitor turnover in vitro [22–24]. Accordingly, we demonstrate
in vivo thatWT mice treated with anti-TNF-a Ab as well TNF-a
deficient mice were more resistant to irradiation-induced BM cell
turnover than non-treated WT mice. Irradiation-induced produc-

tion of TNF-a have also been reported in other systems like lung
[25,26], brain [27] and epidermis [28,29] and related with
malignant transformation.
We developed a model of BM dysfunction induced by
prolonged (long-term) irradiation exposure, to study the impor-
tance of BM TNF-a in this setting. Our aim was to establish a
reproducible and clinically relevant model of BM dysfunction that
resembled secondary (that is, resulting from therapy) MDS. It has
been known for several years, that dogs chronically exposed to low
daily doses of whole-body c-radiation are prone to develop
hematologic changes consistent with a myeloproliferative disorder
[30,31]. In our 3-cycle irradiation model (3x irradiation), 40–50%
of WT mice presented low WBC, anemia and thrombocytopenia,
and elevated MCH-Hemoglobin per RBC (indicative of macro-
cytic anemia). These clinical features, together with the incidence
of cytogenetic abnormalities (which in our in vivo model involved
the loss of microsatelite markers in chromosome 2) are strong
indications of an MDS-like phenotype [19]. TNF-a KO mice
subjected to the same irradiation protocol did not develop BM
dysfunction; cell apoptosis in TNF-a KO mice BM was
significantly reduced, resulting in sustained hematopoietic precur-
sor and mature cell levels, including MK. Besides the maintenance
in MK/platelet levels, the circulating WBC and RBC in 3x
irradiated TNF-a KO mice were also similar to control (non-
irradiated) mice (data not shown). Taken together, these data
strongly suggest that TNF-a KO mice are resistant to irradiation-
induced BM dysfunction.
WT mice with sustained MDS-like symptoms beyond 5 months
after the last irradiation had increased BM angiogenesis, as
determined by quantification of laminin staining in BM sections
and also by quantification of collagen IV and laminin in whole BM
extracts (since laminin and collagen IV are components of the
vessels basement membranes), suggestive of disease progression.
The BM of 3x irradiated WT mice also showed increased MMP
activity, increased VEGF and NFkB p65, in contrast to the BM of
3x irradiated TNF-a KO mice, where these parameters were
unchanged. TNF-a is an important modulator of MMP activity,
namely gelatinaseB/MMP9 [32,33] which is crucial for extracel-
lular matrix remodelling and has also been shown to play a pivotal
role in BM recovery following myelosuppression [34]. We
determined the levels of MMP released by irradiated BM stroma
in the presence or absence of a TNF-a neutralizing antibody in
vitro. Under these conditions, MMP-9 activity in culture superna-
tants was diminished in the presence of the TNF-a antibody (data
not shown) suggesting TNF-a release from the irradiated stroma
induces a rapid MMP release.

tained for CD-41, a megakaryocyte marker, shows increased megakaryocytes in TNF-a KO BM. Nuclei are stained in blue with Dapi. Scale bar = 50 mM.

a slight increase following irradiation. These results were obtained from 3 independent experiments, using 3 animals per experimental group.

Therefore, besides inducing cell apoptosis, overproduction of TNF-
a in the BM microenvironment following irradiation, may induce
MMP-9 and possibly other undisclosed factors, contributing towards
degradation of the endothelial basement membrane and release of pro-
angiogenic factors such as VEGF, which in turn may promote
angiogenesis. Moreover, our data also shows that TNF-a stimulates
VEGF production and release from different BM cells, in particular
MK. Concerning the involvement of NFkB, TNF-a has been shown to
exert some of its effects via NF-kB [35,36] The increase in NFkB p65 in
3x irradiated mice suggests this may be a molecular event involved in
BM dysfunction and possibly progression to an MDS-like phenotype
with increased likelihood of developing acute leukemia.
Our recent unpublished data suggested that MK are major
producers of ECM molecules in the BM microenvironment
(manuscript in preparation) namely fibronectin, suggesting their
survival, observed in TNF-a KO mice, and the resistance of TNF-
a KO mice to the effects of irradiation, may involve the
production (maintenance) of such ECM molecules in the BM
microenvironment. Lack of integrin a4 (which, among other
functions is a receptor for fibronectin) has been shown to restrict
stem-cell BM repopulating capacity and to limit BM stem cells self-
renewal [37].
Two recent elegant studies demonstrated unequivocally that the
interaction between hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and the BM
microenvironment is strictly regulated by Rb and retinoic acid
receptor signalling [38,39]. In both situations, the absence of such
proteins resulted in the development of myeloproliferative diseases;
interestingly, in the case of retinoid acid deficiency, transplanting

other ECM proteins also differs between WT mice BM and TNF-a KO mice BM. As determined by RQ-PCR, the expression of laminin and collagen IV is

total BM from TNF-a KO into retinoic acid receptor deficient
mice protected these from myeloproliferative disease. The authors
concluded that TNF-a is one of the mechanisms involved in BM
malignant transformation, particularly in the case of myeloprolif-
erative disease. The data shown in our present report demon-
strates that TNF-a regulates BM cell turnover (apoptosis) induced
by irradiation, conditioning the onset of BM dysfunction and
secondary MDS-like phenotypes; moreover, our data also
highlight a role for TNF-a in modelling the BM microenviron-
ment, contributing towards the progression of secondary MDS.
Strategies to block TNF-a activity, seeking to neutralize its
inflammatory role, have met some success in the treatment of
epithelial cancers, and to a lesser extent also in subsets of patients
with primary MDS, although with varying degrees of therapeutic
benefit [15–17,40]. The fact that TNF-a is a key regulator of BM
cell apoptosis provided the rationale for the use of TNF-a blockers
in primary MDS. Anti-cytokine therapy (amifostine or pentoxifyl-
line and ciprofloxacin with or without dexamethasone) have been
administered to primary MDS patients and the ones with high BM
TNF-a levels have a better chance of responding to such therapy
Figure 8. 3xirradiated WT mice show MMP activation and increased NFkB and VEGF BM levels in BM extracts. A. Whole BM extracts
obtained from control or irradiated WT and TNF-a KO mice were analysed by zymography. As shown by the classical MMP pattern seen in
zymograms, MMP-9, MMP-2 and MMP-7 could be detected in BM extracts from all the mice. However, in irradiated WT mice (with prolonged MDS)
the levels of MMP-9, MMP-2 and active MMP-2 and MMP-7 increased significantly. These results are representative of 3 mice per experimental group.
B. Whole BM extracts were obtained from control or irradiated WT and TNF-a KO mice and analysed by western blotting. The results show a dramatic
increase in NFkB p65 and in VEGF levels in BM extracts from irradiated WT mice with prolonged MDS, while in BM extracts from TNF-a deficient mice
these parameters remain unchanged. These results are representative of 3 mice per experimental group.

[41,42]. Interestingly, in the reported trials patients with secondary
MDS were excluded. The present report shows the apoptotic
effects of TNF-a may be crucial for BM dysfunction and the onset
of secondary MDS; moreover, since TNF-a (directly or indirectly)
regulates ECM turnover and angiogenesis (as shown in our present
study), it may also promote secondary MDS progression.
Taken together, we suggest that BM TNF-a is a critical factor in
the onset and subsequent progression of irradiation-induced BM
dysfunction with clinical features of secondary MDS (shown in vitro
and in vivo), and as such, strategies designed to block the effects of
TNF-a in the BM microenvironment may be an attractive option
to treat patients with secondary MDS.
Materials and Methods
Mice
TNF-a knock-out (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were obtained
from the Jackson Laboratory, maintained on a C57BL/6
background. Animals were kept under specific pathogen-free
conditions and handled in compliance with the Instituto
Gulbenkian de Cieˆncia or the IBMC-INEB Animal House
guidelines and the European Convention.
Bone Marrow Recovery Model
To determine the effects of short term irradiation in BM
turnover and cytokine induction, 10 week-old WT mice were sub-
lethally irradiated (300 cGy) and BM collected (from flushing one
femur cavity with PBS) at different time-points after irradiation
(6 h–72 h, 7 days). Cell suspension was incubated with red cell
lysis buffer (RCLB) for 15 minutes, centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5
minutes and the supernatant (mononucleated BM cells) collected
for further analysis.
In Vivo TNF-a Neutralization
The TNFa neutralizing antibody was delivered to 10 week-old
WT males by intraperitoneal injections of 1 mg daily, beginning
two days prior sub-lethal irradiation. Control animals received
equivalent amounts of PBS. Following irradiation, BM cells were
isolated at different time-points as described above and processed
for flow cytometry.
Apoptosis Determination
The percentage of apoptotic cells during BM recovery following
irradiation was estimated by flow cytometry in TNF-a KO or WT
(neutralized or not with anti-TNF-a antibody) mice. Total BM
mononuclear cells were double-stained with Annexin V-PE (BD
Biosciences) and FITC-conjugated antibodies against lineage
markers, such as CD11b (Biolegend) and Sca1 (BD Biosciences)
for hematopoietic mature (mostly myeloid) and precursor cells,
respectively. The cells where analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer, using the ‘‘Cell Quest’’ software.
BM Dysfunction/MDS Model
Ten week-old TNF-a KO and WT mice were irradiated sub-
lethally monthly over a three month period (3x irradiation).
Haematological parameters (white blood cells, red blood cells,
platelet levels) from irradiated and control mice were determined 7
days after each irradiation and 3–6 months after the last
irradiation. Peripheral blood was collected from the cheek pouch
in EDTA-coated tubes (Multivette 600, Sarstedt, Nu¨mbrecht,
Germany) and analyzed with a Hemavet 950FS cell counter (Drew
Scientific, Oxford, CT, USA). Apoptotic cells in frozen and
paraffin-embedded BM sections, obtained from mice sacrificed at
the same time-points defined above, were detected by transferase-
mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. We used the in
Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD and DAB Substrate Kits
(Roche), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The percentage
of apoptotic cells was determined by counting stained (TUNEL
positive) nuclei in a total of six high power fields (2006
magnification) per condition. These quantifications were done in
triplicate (3 independent counts/BM section).
Finally, when exhibiting signs of disease (such as weight loss,
reduced mobility and starry coating) animals were sacrificed by
CO2 asphyxiation, their BM and other internal organs removed
and processed for further analysis as described below. As a control,
healthy non-irradiated mice were sacrificed at the end of the
experimental period, approximately 6 months after the last
irradiation. Isolated BM cells or BM sections were obtained and
analysed as described below.

Total BM mononuclear cells from WT mice and murine
stromal cell line S17 were cultured in complete RPMI medium,
10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco BRL), overnight (o.n.) at 37uC. For
all experimental procedures, serum was removed from the
cultures. To determine whether irradiation induced TNF-a from
BM cells, and whether this induced TNF-a leads to BM cell
apoptosis, these BM mononucleated cells were irradiated with
1200 cGy; some of them were previously incubated with anti-
mouse TNF-a/TNFSF1A antibody (R&D Systems), at a concen-
tration of 0.06 mg/mL. Twenty four hours after irradiation,
supernatants were collected and added to new BM mononuclear
cell cultures which were incubated or not with the anti-mouse
TNF-a/TNFSF1A antibody and irradiated (1200 rad) or not
(controls) on the following day. At the end of the experiment, the
incidence of apoptosis in BM cells submitted to different
conditions was determined by flow cytometry (see above).
TNF-a and VEGF ELISA
TNF-a and VEGF protein levels were determined by enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, supernatants from
irradiated and non-irradiated BM cells (isolated for lineage surface
markers CD41 (MK), CD11 (myeloid), Flk1 (endothelium) and
sca1 (hematopoietic precursors) and from cultured stromal cells
were collected, and loaded onto an ELISA kit (Calbiochem)
following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Counterstaining and Immunohistochemistry
BM from TNF-a and WT mice were fixed with 2%
paraformaldayde in 0,12 M phosphate buffer pH 7.2 o.n. and
frozen on dry ice embedded in 0,12 M phosphate buffer pH 7.2,
15% sacarose, 7.5% gelatine.
Eight mm sections from frozen BM were stained for basement
membranes with anti-laminin (Sigma), 1:100, and anti-CD41-
FITC for megakaryocytes (Chemicon) antibodies. Briefly, sections
were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS, 0.1%
BSA, o.n., 4uC, incubated in secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit
Alex Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:1000 in PBS, 0.1%
BSA. At the end, slides were mounted on Vectashield mounting-
medium with Dapi (Vector) and analyzed by fluorescence
microscopy on an Axioplan Microscope (Zeiss).
RQ-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from mononuclear BM cells and
cDNA synthesized following conventional protocols. D2Mit447
probe was design for a microsatellite located in a highly instable
region of chromosome 2, prone to be lost after irradiation. TNF-a

and D2Mit447 microssatelite mRNA quantification was per-
formed by real time polimerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) using
the SYBR Green Master Mix kit (Applied Biosystems). Mouse b-
actin gene (endogenous housekeeping gene) was used as standard
reference (normalizer). The relative expression of TNF-a and
D2Mit447 was calculated by using the comparative threshold
cycle (CT) method.
Protein Expression
Total protein extracts from all BM were obtained by lysing the
samples in cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS), in the presence
of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After 30 minutes on ice,
lysates were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4uC and 14000 rpm.
Equal protein amounts from each sample were used for dot-
blotting and western blotting assays.
For dot-blotting, primary antibodies were anti-human fibronec-
tin (Sigma), 1:500, anti-laminin (Sigma), 1:250, anti-collagen IV,
(Chemicon), 1:100 and anti-b-actin (Sigma), 1:250.
For Western blotting the following antibodies and respective
dilutions were used: anti-VEGF (Santa Cruz), 1:400, anti-NFkB
p65 (Santa Cruz), 1:1000, and anti-b-actin (Sigma), 1:250.
For both assays, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in PBS,
1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20 or PBS, 5% milk, depending on the
antibody manufacturer’s protocol, for 1 hour at room temperature.
Secondary antibodies were anti–rabbit IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz),
anti–mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz) and anti–goat IgG-HRP (Santa
Cruz), all at 1:6000. The electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection
system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to visualize the presence of
specific proteins on the nitrocellulose blots. The blots obtained by
dot-blotting were quantified with Image J program and represent
relative expression levels of each protein.
Gelatin Zymography
Presence or absence of latent or active species of MMP-2 and
29 were monitored by gelatin zymography. Briefly, equal volumes
(40 ml) of supernatant obtained from cell cultures, both from bone
marrow mononucleated and stromal cells were mixed with 5x
sample buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% sodium dodecyl
sulfate, 50% glycerol, and bromophenol blue) and loaded onto a
10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel containing 0.12%
gelatin (Sigma Chemical Co.). The gel was run under nonreducing
conditions at constant voltage of 180 V for 5 hours. To remove
SDS and allow the MMPs to renuture, the gel was incubated in
2.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h in an orbital
shaker, and then incubated in low salt collagenase buffer (50 mM
Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.2 M NaCl and 0.02% Brij-35) at
37uC, overnight. To reveal the lysis zones, the gel was stained in
stain/destain solution for 30 minutes, and washed in distilled
water.
Statistical Analysis
Results are expressed as mean 6 standard deviation. Data were
analyzed using the unpaired two-tailed student’s t test or the one-
way ANOVA Turkey test. P values of ,0.05 were considered
significant.
Supporting Information
Figure S1 Irradiation induces the loss of microsatelite markers.
Total BM cells were obtained from control and 3xirradiated mice.
The results show the loss of microssatelite markers (D2Mit230) in
irradiated mice BM cells, suggesting the irradiation protocol
induces chromosomal abnormalities in irradiated mice bone
marrow cells. *: p,0.01
