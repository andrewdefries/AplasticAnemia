A sequence-dependent exonuclease activity from
Tetrahymena thermophila
Hui-I Kao Tom, Carol W Greider*
Abstract
Background: Telomere function requires a highly conserved G rich 3’- overhang. This structure is formed by 5’-
resection of the C-rich telomere strand. However, while many nucleases have been suggested to play a role in
processing, it is not yet clear which nucleases carry out this 5’-resection.
Results: We used biochemical purification to identify a sequence-dependent exonuclease activity in Tetrahymena
thermophila cell extracts. The nuclease activity showed specificity for 5’-ends containing AA or AC sequences, unlike
Exo1, which showed sequence-independent cleavage. The Tetrahymena nuclease was active on both
phosphorylated and unphosphorylated substrates whereas Exo1 requires a 5’-phosphate for cleavage.
Conclusions: The specificities of the enzyme indicate that this novel Tetrahymena exonuclease is distinct from
Exo1 and has properties required for 3’-overhang formations at telomeres.
Background
Functional telomeres are essential for cell survival. Telo-
meres distinguish natural chromosome ends from DNA
breaks. When telomere function is lost, cells arrest and
undergo senescence or apoptosis [1-6]. Normal DNA
replication causes telomere shortening, which is coun-
terbalanced by the extension activity of telomerase [7].
The majority of cancers have telomerase activity, and
this activity is needed for ongoing division of tumor
cells. In somatic cells, telomerase activity is absent or
low. When cell division occurs faster than the ability of
telomerase to elongate telomeres, the short telomeres
limit cell replicative capacity [1,8]. This limited cell divi-
sion underlies diseases of tissue renewal such as dysker-
atosis congenita, aplastic anemia, and pulmonary fibrosis
[9-13]. Thus, telomere length regulation plays a pivotal
role in cancer and in age-related degenerative disease.
Both telomeric DNA structure and telomerase play a
role in establishing telomere length and end protection.
Telomeres have a G-rich 3’-overhang that was first dis-
covered in ciliates [14] and is a conserved feature of tel-
omeres in all eukaryotes [14-21]. This 3’-overhang is the
binding site for essential telomere proteins, such as
Cdc13 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pot1 in
mammals and other species. Loss of the overhangs due
to disruption of the telomere complex, termed shelterin,
leads to telomere-induced DNA damage response and
chromosome end-to-end fusion [22,23]. In addition to
maintenance of DNA ends, the 3’-overhang is essential
for telomerase accessibility. Telomerase recognizes and
elongates single-stranded DNA substrates, but not dou-
ble-stranded substrates [24]. Thus, the processing of
blunt ends, generated by replication, is needed for telo-
merase to elongate telomeres. In vivo, blocking 3’-over-
hang formation in S. cerevisiae blocks the ability of
telomerase to elongate a telomere seed sequence [25].
3’-overhang formation is an active process. In S. cerevi-
siae and mice, generation of the 3’-overhang occurs in
the absence of telomerase [26,27]. In Tetrahymena, a
conditional telomerase protein component (TERT)
knockout cell line showed that telomerase depletion had
relatively little effects on absolute G overhang length,
indicating C-strand degradation, not telomerase elonga-
tion of the G-rich strand, must generate the overhang
structures [28]. Inhibition of Cdk1 blocks C-rich strand
resection, thereby inhibiting 3’-overhang production
[25,29]. These data suggest that there is a nuclease regu-
lated by Cdk1 that processes the telomeres prior to elon-
gation by telomerase. Additional evidence for an active
processing enzyme comes from the fact that both ends of
a chromosome have similar overhang structures.

Replication of a chromosome to the very end is predicted
to generate one chromosome end with a 3’-overhang and
one with a blunt end [30]. However, chromosomes in
ciliates as well as in yeast and mammals have 3’-over-
hangs on both ends, [16,18,31-33], implying at least one
end must be processed to generate the overhang
structure.
Finally, the very precise structure of the telomere
overhangs implies that it is formed by a regulated pro-
cess. The length and sequence of the 3’-overhangs in
Oxytricha and Tetrahymena are surprisingly homoge-
neous [14,16]. In Oxytricha, there is a precise overhang
of two 8 nucleotide 5’-TTTTGGGG-3’ repeats, whereas
in Tetrahymena, the overhangs are either 14-15 or 20-
21 nucleotides in length, and the majority of 5’-strands
end in 3’-CCAACC-5’, or 3’-CAACCC-5’ [16,28]. In
mammals, this overhang length is also conserved [34].
This functional and structural evidence argues for the
existence of a sequence-specific nuclease that processes
telomeres. To investigate the role of 3’-overhang proces-
sing, we set out to identify a telomere-specific nuclease
activity. We chose Tetrahymena to look for processing
activity because it has uniform telomere repeat
sequence, a precise 3’-overhang structure, and a history
as an excellent biochemical source for telomere-proces-
sing factors. Here we describe a sequence-dependent 5’
to 3’ exonuclease activity from Tetrahymena that pro-
cesses the C-strand of telomere substrates in vitro.
Results
To identify an overhang-processing nuclease, we assayed
cell extracts from Tetrahymena [7]. We designed speci-
fic duplex oligonucleotide substrates to detect a telo-
mere-specific nuclease activity (Figure 1A). The duplex
oligonucleotide substrate contains specific non-telomeric
sequences with a biotin moiety that binds to streptavidin
to block non-specific degradation from one end (Addi-
tional file 1, supplementary Figure S1 and Figure 1B,
compare lanes 2 to 3 and lanes 5 to 6). On the other
end, the substrates contained either telomere repeats
(5’-GGGGTT-3’) or non-telomeric sequence. We tested
substrates that were either blunt-ended, or with a 5’- or
a 3’-overhang. To distinguish size changes of the sub-
strates on each strand, we labeled each strand of the
substrate separately in order to monitor processing
occurred on the corresponding strand (Figure 1A).
Identification of a nuclease activity from Tetrahymena
crude extracts with preference for telomere substrates
We initially incubated the non-telomeric and telomeric
blunt-ended substrates with crude Tetrahymena cell
extracts (Figure 1B) and analyzed processing by gel elec-
trophoresis and autoradiography. We observed a nuclease
activity that degraded the telomeric substrate to a greater
degree than the non-telomeric substrate (compare lanes
3 to 6). This activity was robust, strand-specific, and
sequence-dependent. The nuclease cleaved the 5’-strand
of a blunt-ended substrate containing telomere repeats.
To further characterize this nuclease activity, we per-
formed biochemical purification. Extracts were precipi-
tated with ammonium sulfate, and then enriched on
several fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) col-
umns in the following order: Phenyl Sepharose, Affi-Gel
Blue Gel (AGB), Mono-Q, Gel Filtration-Superdex 200,
and Hydroxyapatite (HAP) (Figure 1C). The final active
fractions were concentrated by a Mono-Q or a Q-spin
column. The activity of the fractions from each step of
the purification was analyzed, and the purification was
monitored by Bradford protein assay and SDS-PAGE
(Additional file 2, supplementary Figure S2). The final Q
concentration step showed that the nuclease activity was
highly enriched in three fractions (Additional file 2, sup-
plementary Figure S2B, lanes 4-6). The active fraction
contained low amount of protein, which could only be
visualized on a silver-stained gel (Additional file 2, sup-
plementary Figure S2A, lane 5). The gel filtration step
of the purification indicated the active nuclease was
approximately 100 kDa in size (Figure 1D).
After obtaining highly-active fractions, we character-
ized the specificity of the enzyme; both enzyme titration
and time-course assays showed significant preference for
telomeric over non-telomeric substrates (Figures 2A and
2B). The telomere repeat-containing substrates were
efficiently processed by the nuclease (Figure 2A, lanes
7-12 and Figure 2B, lanes 19-24) throughout the incuba-
tion time while the non-telomeric and 5’-strand labeled
substrates were only minimally degraded (Figure 2A,
lanes 1-6 and Figure 2B, lanes 7-12). Cleavage was spe-
cific to telomeric 5’-strands: the substrates that were
labeled on the 3’-strand showed no degradation by the
nuclease (Figure 2B, lanes 1-6 and 13-18). Thus, proces-
sing of the blunt substrates by this nuclease leads to
3’-overhang formation.
The Tetrahymena nuclease is a DNA exonuclease
We examined whether the Tetrahymena nuclease could
cleave RNA substrates. We tested both non-telomeric
and telomeric DNA (Figure 2C, lanes 1-12) and the cor-
responding RNA (lanes 13-24) in substrate structures as
either heteroduplex DNA/RNA or homoduplex DNA/
DNA or RNA/RNA. The nuclease cleaved the telomeric
DNA substrates in a DNA/DNA homoduplex (lanes
7-9), but showed a lower level of cleavage activity on
the telomeric DNA/RNA in a heteroduplex structure
where the C strand was the DNA strand (lanes 10-12).
No cleavage activity was observed when the C strand
was made of RNA in either RNA/RNA or RNA/DNA
duplexes (lanes 13-24). Thus, we conclude that the

Tetrahymena nuclease is a DNase, specific to cleaving
DNA linkages.
To determine whether the repeat length affected
nuclease cleavage activity, we examined the consequence
of varying the repeat numbers in the telomeric sub-
strates (Figure 3A). We observed substantial cleavage at
similar level on 3-repeat, 4-repeat, and 5-repeat
oligonucleotide, indicating that the cleavage by this Tet-
rahymena nuclease is not affected by telomeric repeat
length.
The lack of length dependence suggested that the
enzyme may be degrading the substrates from the end,
like an exonuclease. Exonuclease activity removes a
mononucleotide from free DNA ends while an

endonuclease removes oligonucleotide at each cleavage
event [35]. To examine the type of degradation this
nuclease exhibits, we used end-labeled substrates rather
than the internally-labeled substrates described above
(Figure 3B). With these end-labeled phosphorylated sub-
strates, we observed cleavage on both non-telomeric and
telomeric substrates (Figure 3B, lanes 2-3 and 5-6), and
the cleavage product was mononucleotide. The
decreased specificity for telomere repeats was due to the
addition of the phosphate on the 5’ strand as described
in detail below. Because the first nucleotides on the
non-telomeric and telomeric substrates were different,
the mononucleotide products exhibited different
mobility on a gel. This data suggested that Tetrahymena
nuclease is an exonuclease.
To further examine the potential exonuclease activity
of the Tetrahymena enzyme, we used oligonucleotides
with specific bonds containing phosphorothioate linkage
modification. This modification blocks cleavage activity
of nucleases. We first tested the internally-labeled sub-
strates that each contained one to several adjacent phos-
phorothioate linkages at positions 1-3, 5-11, 6-7, 7-8,
and 8-9 (counting from the 5’ terminus of the substrate)
(Figure 3C). While the unmodified non-telomeric and
telomeric substrates behaved as expected, we saw com-
plete blockage of nuclease activity when there were

phosphorothioate linkages at position 1-3 (lanes 5-6).
When phosphorothioate linkages were placed at more
internal positions, we saw significant cleavage that did
not extend as far into the DNA as the unmodified sub-
strates, indicating cleavage only occurred up to the
blockage sites (lanes 7-14). To further examine the exo-
nuclease activity, we synthesized substrates with indivi-
dual bonds blocked with phosphorothioate modification
and labeled at the 5’-end (Figure 3D). We tested these
5’-labeled substrates with the Tetrahymena nuclease.
Blockage between nucleotide positions 1-2 significantly
reduced the cleavage by the nuclease (lanes 5-6) whereas
terminal cleavage still occurred on all other substrates
(lanes 7-20). We concluded that the Tetrahymena nucle-
ase activity we isolated is an exonuclease.
When using end-labeled substrates, we also detected a
band that appeared to be larger than a mononucleotide
(indicated by an arrow, Figures 3B and 3D). While the
position of this band first suggested that it might be an
endonucleolytic cleavage product, it was blocked by the
phosphorothioate at the 1-2 position. We tried to map
the size of this product, but its mobility varied depend-
ing on the acrylamide concentration, and it did not line
up with either 3’-phosphate or 5’-phosphate marker lad-
ders (data not shown). We conclude that this may be a
modified nucleotide given that its generation is blocked
by the terminal phosphorothioate linkage.
The Tetrahymena nuclease only cleaves specific
permutations of the 5’-telomeric C-rich strand
To further examine the sequence specificity of the exonu-
clease activity, we examined all the permutations of the
Tetrahymena 6-nucleotide telomeric repeat sequence. Sur-
prisingly, there was significantly more cleavage of telo-
meric substrates with sequences ending in 5’-AA or 5’-CA
while other permutations were not cleaved (Figure 4A).
We also tested telomeric repeat sequences from human
(5’-AACCCT-3’) and yeast (5’-AC1-3-3’) and observed clea-
vage on both of these substrates (Figure 4B). As a negative
control, we tested a random non-telomeric 6-nucleotide
repeat (5’-ATCGTC-3’) and found no significant degrada-
tion (lanes 13-15).
The specificity for certain permutations of the
CCCCAA repeat suggested that there may be an end-
nucleotide sequence preference. Many exonucleases
have been biochemically characterized and have been
grouped based on their processing polarity, domain
similarity, and substrate specificity, such as structure-
specific 5’ nucleases, 3’-5’ exonucleases, metallo-beta-
lactamase family, and single-stranded-specific nucleases
(reviewed in [36-40]). None of these exonucleases that
have been previously characterized show sequences spe-
cificity. Thus, we sought to characterize the sequence
specificity of this Tetrahymena exonuclease in detail.
Since our nuclease is an exonuclease, to examine the
sequence specificity, we compared the activity of the
Tetrahymena exonuclease to the activity of the well-
characterized Exo1 that has been implicated in telomere
processing. Exo1 has a strong preference for cleavage of
DNA with a 5’-phosphate [41]. Thus, we first compared
the cleavage of 5’-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated
substrates with the purified Tetrahymena nuclease
(Figure 5A). Both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated
telomeric substrates were cleaved to a similar extent by
the Tetrahymena nuclease (compare lanes 8 to 4).
There was also an increase in cleavage activity on the
5’-phosphorylated, non-telomeric substrate. While this
non-telomeric cleavage on 5’-phosphorylated substrate
was less extensive than cleavage on the telomeric sub-
strate, this data implies a reduced specificity for telo-
meric substrates on 5’-phosphorylated DNA. We next
utilized human Exo1 in cleavage assays to compare the
biochemical properties of our Tetrahymena nuclease.
For convenience, whenever Exo1 activity is mentioned
in this study, it refers to human Exo1. Enzyme titration
of Exo1 with phosphorylated substrates showed that it
robustly cleaves DNA from 5’-end into the substrate up
to the internal labeling site, releasing the internally
labeled nucleotide that runs at the bottom of the gel
(Figure 5B). However, Exo1 did not show any preference
for telomeric versus non-telomeric substrates (compare
lanes 1-9 to 10-18).
Besides cleavage on single-stranded DNA, Exo1 also
exhibits structural preferences on certain substrates. As
an exonuclease, Exo1 prefers 5’-recessed structures, and
as an endonuclease, it cleaves flapped structures [41,42].
Because of these structural preferences for Exo1, we
tested the specificities of these two nucleases with sub-
strates that had different end structures (Figure 5C). We
designed telomeric, and non-telomeric substrates ending
in either 5’-CGAA or 5’-AATG that were either blunt, or
had a 3’- or 5’-overhang. Using non-phosphorylated sub-
strates, all of the telomeric substrates were actively
cleaved by the Tetrahymena nuclease (lanes 12, 15 and
18). The Exo1 digestions showed a preference for sub-
strates that contained a 3’ overhang (lanes 5, 14 and 23)
as described previously [41]. We also examined the activ-
ities of both enzymes on phosphorylated substrates and
found similar results, although the level of Exo1 cleavage
was higher (data not shown). Since there was no prefer-
ence for the different structures tested with the Tetrahy-
mena exonuclease, we concluded that this enzyme does
not show the structure-dependent activity of Exo1.
Tetrahymena exonuclease shows end-nucleotide
specificity
Because the Tetrahymena exonuclease showed a pre-
ference for AA and CA terminal nucleotides on

nonphosphorylated telomeric substrates (see Figure 4A),
we next ask whether end-sequence specificity is preserved
in the presence of 5’-phosphorylated substrates. We exam-
ined the six different permutations of the telomere repeat
using both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated telo-
meric substrates. The Tetrahymena nuclease showed
sequence preference for AA and CA ending substrates
(Additional file 3, supplementary Figure S3), while Exo1
did not show significant sequence specificity.
We next tested a series of non-telomeric substrates
with all possible permutations of the 5’-terminal two
nucleotides (Figure 6). The substrates were all intern-
ally-labeled. When testing unphosphorylated substrates
(Figure 6A), there was some cleavage of all substrates,
except when G was the terminal nucleotide. There was
a clear preference for substrates ending with an A resi-
due. The order of cleavage preference for the terminal
nucleotide was A>T>C>G (lanes 1-3 and 7-51).

However, the cleavage pattern on these non-telomeric
substrates was limited to terminal nucleotides compared
to the more extensive cleavage of the telomeric sub-
strate (compare lanes 4-6 to 22-24). This difference in
the extent of cleavage may be due to the specific
nucleotide that is exposed next or may be influenced by
contacts with internal nucleotides in the telomere
repeats. The possibility of contacts with internal nucleo-
tides could also explain the low cleavage observed on
yeast repeat sequences ending in 5’-AC when compared
to the Tetrahymena repeat permutation ending in 5’-AC
(Figure 4). Incubation of the Tetrahymena exonuclease
with the same set of sequences that were 5’-phosphory-
lated showed a similar trend of sequence specificity (Fig-
ure 6B). Exo1 was tested along side the Tetrahymena
exonuclease, and it cleaved all phosphorylated substrates
well. However, Exo1 did not show any specificity for the
terminal nucleotide sequences (Figure 6B), note the
similar intensity of the mononucleotide band in every
3rd
lane on the gel. Unphosphorylated substrates were
also cleaved by Exo1 without any sequence preferences,
except that the level of cleavage was lower (Figure 6A).
Together, this data suggests that unlike Exo1, which is a
structure-specific nuclease, the Tetrahymena nuclease is
a sequence-dependent exonuclease.
Discussion
We have identified a sequence-dependent exonuclease
activity that possesses the biochemical properties to pro-
cess C-rich telomere strands and generate 3’ G-strand
overhangs. This 3’-overhang is a ubiquitous structure of
eukaryotic telomeres, and is essential for telomere end
protection and for elongation by telomerase. The Tetra-
hymena nuclease we described is a 100 kDa enzyme
that shows preference for cleaving AA- or CA-ending
residues that are present in the C-strand of telomeric
repeats.
The existence of a telomere-specific nuclease has been
postulated for years. A number of nucleases including
Mre11, Sae2, Dna2, Artemis, Apollo, Werner syndrome
protein (WRN), and Exo1 have been examined for their
role in different aspects of telomere processing
[37,43-52]. Mre11 and WRN are both 3’-5’ nucleases
that have been found associated with telomeres [53-57].
Figure 6 Enriched Tetrahymena nuclease shows sequence-dependant cleavage. Activity of Tetrahymena nuclease (30 ng) and Exo1 (1 fmol
or 0.04 ng) with various unique sequences that end in all combinations of two terminal nucleotides, either unphosphorylated (A) or
phosphorylated (B) were tested. Reactions were performed for 20 min and resolved on 10% urea denaturing polyacrylamide gels. All assays were
run and performed on the same day, and the time for exposure to phosphorimager screens was the same. Substrates used are: S1:S18* (lanes

While the directionality of Mre11 and WRN is not con-
sistent with 5’-strand resection at the telomere, recent
biochemical studies of WRN show a sequence-specific
cleavage on telomeric 3’-overhang [46], suggesting WRN
may pay a role in processing the G-rich overhang
strand.
Sae2, Artemis, Apollo, and Dna2 are 5’ nucleases, but
none of these nucleases show biochemical specificity for
either blunt-ended or telomeric substrates. Apollo, inter-
acts with the telomere-binding protein, TRF2, and
cleaves single-stranded DNA but shows no sequence
preferences in vitro between telomeric repeats and
unique sequences [58,59]. Recent studies have showed
that Apollo is recruited by TRF2 and plays a role in pro-
cessing leading-strand overhangs in mice [51], and
human Apollo cooperates with TRF2 to help resolve
topological stress during telomere replication [60]. Sae2
is an endonuclease with substrate specificity on 3’ over-
hangs, hairpins, and branched DNA [61], and it pro-
cesses hairpin structures and meiotic double-strand
breaks together with MRX/N complex [61-66]. Dna2 is
a multi-functional enzyme that possesses helicase and
single-stranded DNA specific endonuclease activities. In
S. pombe, Dna2 was implicated in telomere 3’-overhang
generation [48], but in vitro, Dna2 shows no sequence
specificity for cleavage of single-stranded DNA (Kao &
Bambara, unpublished results). These differences in bio-
logical specificity indicate that the Tetrahymena exonu-
clease is not the same enzyme as any of these known
5’-3’ nucleases.
Because our enzyme has a 5’-3’ exonuclease activity,
we compared its biochemical properties with Exo1.
Exo1 is a well-characterized 5’-3’ nuclease that plays a
role in multiple DNA metabolic pathways [41], includ-
ing telomere maintenance [44,49,52,67-69]. In vivo evi-
dence suggests that Exo1 contributes to telomere
maintenance [44] and may participate in the generation
of ssDNA at dysfunctional telomeres [52,67]. Studies
have also shown that Exo1 is important in processing
ends for the recombination pathways that allow survi-
vors to grow in the absence of telomerase in yeast [68].
The biochemical specificity we report for the Tetrahy-
mena exonuclease is different from the properties of
Exo1. The Tetrahymena nuclease has specificity for telo-
mere repeats ending in 5’-AA and 5’-CA, but Exo 1 did
not show sequence specificity. In addition, Exo1 shows
much higher activity on phosphorylated substrates ([70],
Figure 6, and Additional file 3, supplementary Figure
S3) while the Tetrahymena exonuclease has significant
activity on both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated
substrates. These differences in specificity indicate that
the Tetrahymena exonuclease that we purified is distinct
from Exo1.
Several lines of evidence indicate that C-strand pro-
cessing is regulated; the precise structure of 3’-over-
hangs in ciliates [14,16,28], the cell cycle-specific
generation of 3’-overhangs in yeast, and the formation
of overhangs in the absence of telomerase [26,27]. This
regulation occurs through both Cdk1 [25,29] and
through telomere-specific binding proteins. Telomere
end-binding proteins, such as TEBP ab heterodimer,
first discovered in Oxytricha [71,72], bind to single-
stranded telomeric DNA through an OB fold and pro-
tect the telomeres from degradation, recombination, and
end-joining [73,74]. In yeast, Cdc13 binds to the single-
stranded overhang, and together with Stn1 and Ten1
[75] protect the ends and play a role in end-processing
and telomere elongation. In mammalian cells, Pot1, a
component of the shelterin complex, binds the single-
stranded overhang through an OB fold domain similar
to the TEBP a [76]. Pot1 also plays a role along with
other shelterin complex components in regulating access
of processing nucleases to telomeres [29,77]. Thus, the
specific action of telomere processing nucleases on telo-
meres will involve interaction with these telomere-speci-
fic binding proteins.
Conclusions
Telomere structure and function is conserved through-
out eukaryotes. Telomerase is present in most eukar-
yotes and is essential for telomere elongation. The
negative feedback mechanism in which telomere-binding
proteins inhibit elongation of long telomeres and allow
the establishment of a telomere length equilibrium
[22,78] is also conserved from yeast to mammals. While
the sequence of telomere-binding proteins in different
organisms differ, the function of these proteins in end
protection and regulation of telomere elongation is
highly conserved [79]. Given this conservation, we think
it is likely that telomere processing is also conserved.
While there are likely multiple factors involved in telo-
mere processing, the sequence-specific properties of the
Tetrahymena exonuclease described here suggest it may
play a role in telomere processing.
Methods
Tetrahymena extracts
Both mated and unmated cell extracts were tested, and
nuclease activity was found in both. Mated cell extracts
were obtained as described previously [80]. Unmated cell
extracts were obtained by growing 36 liters of B2086 Tet-
rahymena cells without starvation or mating steps.
Nuclease Purification
All the purification steps for Tetrahymena nuclease were
carried out at 4°C. Approximately 1 liter of total cell

extracts was first fractionated by (NH4)2SO4 precipita-
tion. The supernatant was collected, and the pellets
were resuspended in TMG+
buffer (TMG: 10 mM Tris,
pH 8.0, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mM b-mercap-
toethanol, 0.1 mM PMSF, with RNase inhibitor and 1×
protease inhibitor cocktail). Nuclease activity was
detected in pellets of 60% and 70% fractions, which
were combined and loaded onto a Phenyl Sepharose col-
umn on an ÄKTA Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography
system, FPLC (GE Healthcare, Amersham Biosciences,
NJ). Proteins were eluted at a gradient of TMG-1.7 M
(NH4)2SO4 to TMG-0 M. Nuclease activity was detected
in TMG 400 mM ~ 500 mM (NH4)2SO4. The positive
fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and then loaded onto an
Affi-Gel Blue Gel column (Bio-Rad, CA). The proteins
were eluted in a gradient from TMG-0M KCl to TMG-
1M KCl, and nuclease activity was detected in TMG
200 mM ~ 400 mM KCl fractions. The positive fractions
were combined, dialyzed, and loaded onto a Mono-Q
column (GE Healthcare, Amersham Biosciences, NJ).
The proteins were eluted with a TMG-0M KCl to
TMG-1M KCl gradient, and active fractions eluted at
TMG 250 mM KCl ~ 400 mM KCl. The nuclease activ-
ity positive fractions were combined, concentrated with
a Q spin column (Viva Science, Germany), and loaded
onto a Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare, Amersham Bios-
ciences, NJ) gel filtration column with TMG-100 mM
KCl buffer. A gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad, CA) was
used to estimate the MW of the nuclease. Kav was cal-
culated by the following equation: Kav = (Ve-Vo)/(Vt-
Vo), where Kav is a constant that is between 0-1, Ve is
elution volume for the protein, Vo is column void
volume (typically, 30% of the total column volume), and
Vt is total bed volume. Kav was then plotted against
Log MW of the standard, which was used to determine
the MW of the nuclease. The nuclease ran at approxi-
mately 100 KDa (Figure 1D). Active fractions were com-
bined and loaded onto a hydroxyapatite, HAP, column
(Bio-Rad, CA). The column was eluted with a gradient
from TMG-0M to TMG-250 mM potassium phosphate,
and the active fractions were found at 15 ~ 60 mM
potassium phosphate. ~ 2,500 fold enriched nuclease
preparation was obtained, and the active and purified
fractions were combined, dialyzed, and concentrated
using a Mono-Q or Q spin column.
Oligonucleotide substrates
The oligonucleotide sequences utilized in this report are
listed in Additional file 4, supplementary Table S1. Oli-
gonucleotides were annealed to generate double-
stranded substrates as described in the figure legends.
A schematic representation of substrates is shown in
Figure 1A and subsequent figures. Each internally-
labeled oligonucleotide substrate was generated by
labeling the downstream primers using [g-32
P]ATP
(6000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Science Products,
MA) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied
Sciences, IN), followed by ligation. End-labeled sub-
strates were obtained by using [g-32
P]ATP (6000 Ci/
mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The biotinylated
substrates and unmodified primers were synthesized by
Operon Biotechnologies, Inc. (Huntsville, AL), and the
RNA-containing and phosphorothioate oligonucleotides
were from Integrated DNA Technology (Coralville, IA).
The 10-nucleotide markers were obtained from GIBCO
(Invitrogen-GIBCO, CA). All radiolabeled primers were
purified by gel isolation from 10% polyacrylamide, 7 M
urea, denaturing gels.
Nuclease assays
Activity assays were performed in reaction buffer that
was adapted from the telomerase assay conditions [24]:
50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol,
50 mM KCl, and 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM spermindine, and
0.1 μl of RNase inhibitor. Exo1 activity was done in a
reaction buffer condition adapted as described previously
[41]: 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.8), 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT,
5 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 100 ug/mL BSA, and
5% glycerol. Each reaction contained 5 fmol substrate
and 25-fold excess of streptavidin in a 20-μl reaction
volume with different amounts of purified nuclease as
indicated in the figure legends. All the assays were prein-
cubated at 30°C for 5 min. to allow streptavidin and bio-
tin binding (Additional file 1, supplementary Figure S1).
The reactions were initiated at 30°C or 37°C (for hExo1)
for 15 or 20 min., and reactions were then stopped by the
addition of 20 μl 2× termination dye (95% formamide (v/
v) with bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol). The heat-
denatured reactions were resolved on either 10% or 15%
polyacrylamide, 7 M urea denaturing gels. Each gel was
quantitated using a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare, NJ)
and analyzed using ImageQuant v1.2 software from
Molecular Dynamics (GE Healthcare, NJ). 10-nucleotide
markers are run and labeled on the left side of all shown
gels. All assays were performed multiple times, and
representative assays are shown.
Additional material
Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure S1 - Majority of
biotinylated substrates were streptavidin bound. A gel-shift assay is
shown in 10% native polyacrylamide gel. Substrates in reaction buffers
(conditions as described in “Methods”) were incubated with and without
streptavidin for 5 min. at 30°C. The mixtures were in 1× DNA loading dye
(0.04% bromophenol blue, 0.04% xylene cyanol, and 5% glycerol) at a
final volume of 12 μl containing a total of 5 fmol substrates. Half of this
mixture was loaded onto a 10% native gel. The gel was then dried and
viewed by PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare, NJ). Lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13,
15, 17, 19, 21, and 23 are substrates without streptavidin, and lanes 2, 4, 6,
8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 are substrates with streptavidin.
