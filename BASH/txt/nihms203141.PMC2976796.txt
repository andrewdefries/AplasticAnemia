Abstract
A non-myeloablative conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine (FLU) and 2 Gy total body
irradiation (TBI) has been used with great experience and engraftment success without promoting
excessive non-relapse mortality (NRM) in medically infirm patients requiring hematopoietic cell
transplantation (HCT). Here, we studied this same low-toxicity regimen as a means to promote
engraftment of unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) in patients with Fanconi
Anemia (FA). All patients tolerated the regimen well with no mucositis or other severe toxicity.
Of six patients transplanted, five achieved stable mixed or full donor chimerism. Acute and
chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in four and three patients, respectively. Three
patients are alive and well a median of 45.9 (range, 20.9–68.1) months after transplant. In
summary, this FLU-based regimen facilitates stable engraftment of unrelated PBSC but is
associated with significant chronic GVHD.

INTRODUCTION
FA is a rare, heterogeneous disorder characterized by progressive marrow failure and
susceptibility to malignancies. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), while the only
known cure for the hematological manifestations of this disease, is associated with
considerable toxicity in FA patients due to their underlying DNA repair defects and inability
to tolerate conventional doses of cytotoxic therapy.1 Studies incorporating reduced doses of
chemotherapy have allowed high rates of engraftment and excellent survival with minimal
toxicity when using human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donors.2 However,
similar results have been more difficult to achieve when using HLA-matched unrelated
donors due to higher rates of both graft rejection and GVHD.3 A retrospective analysis of
unrelated donor transplants conducted by the CIBMTR registry showed a benefit when
using FLU, rather than non-FLU, based regimens.4 However, to promote engraftment in the
unrelated donor setting, FLU historically has been combined with other agents, such as TBI
at moderate doses, which has contributed to additional toxicity.5 In particular, irradiation at
doses exceeding 4–5 Gy has been associated with additional acute toxicity and secondary
malignancies in FA patients, especially squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.6,7
There has also been some precedence in eliminating TBI altogether when using unrelated
donors to reduce these late effects.8 Accordingly, we reasoned that a well-established non-
myeloablative conditioning regimen9,10 typically reserved for high-risk, medically fragile
patients that uses FLU and low-dose TBI, in combination with cyclosporine (CSP) and
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), could also be attempted in FA patients to facilitate
engraftment without excessive toxicity. Even when used to salvage a high-risk, non-FA
population who rejected prior allogeneic transplants, this regimen was able to promote
sustained engraftment in 87% of patients, with four of five patients who failed to engraft
having myelofibrosis.11
This study was also designed to reduce and possibly eliminate the already low-dose of TBI
for future cohorts based on high rates of engraftment. Finally, since we have shown that FA
patients undergoing HLA-matched sibling transplants can tolerate a dose of
cyclophosphamide (CY) 60 mg/kg for conditioning, 32818} we hypothesized that a regimen
that incorporated no alkylating agents and only a low-dose of TBI in the HLA-matched,
unrelated donor setting would also be similarly tolerable. Thus, the goal of this trial was to
evaluate engraftment and toxicity associated with FLU and low dose TBI in patients with
FA.
METHODS
Patient characteristics
Between August 2001 and September 2006, six patients confirmed as having FA by
chromosomal breakage analysis and requiring allogeneic transplantation for aplastic anemia
but having no HLA-matched sibling donors were enrolled on FHCRC Protocol 1444 at four
different centers. Participating centers included Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,
Seattle, WA; Children’s Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL; Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s
Hospital at Vanderbilt, Nashville, TN; and Primary Children’s Medical Center, Salt Lake
City, UT. All patients and/or legal guardians provided informed consent using Institutional
Review Board approved documents. Patients were between the ages of 9.9–12.1 (median,
10.6) years at the time of transplant. Additional patient characteristics are detailed in Table
1.

Donor characteristics
Patients and donors were typed at HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, and DQB1 using high-resolution
DNA-based methods. Donors were matched with the patient for HLA-DRB1 and DQB1,
and either matched (n=4) or mismatched for a single allele at HLA-A, B, or C (n=2). PBSC
were mobilized with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) at a dose of 10 μg/kg
for 5 days. All donors provided informed consent per National Marrow Donor Program
(NMDP) guidelines. Additional donor characteristics can be found in Table 1.
Transplant characteristics
The conditioning regimen consisted of FLU 30 mg/m2 from days −4 to −2 and 2 Gy TBI
day 0.9,10 PBSC were T-cell replete and infused on day 0. Infused cell doses can be found in
Table 1. Post-grafting immunosuppression consisted of CSP from days −3 to +100 then
tapered to day +177, and MMF from days 0 to +40 then tapered to day +96.
Outcome measures and statistical methods
Graft rejection was defined as <5%, mixed chimerism between 5–95%, and full donor
chimerism as >95% donor CD3 chimerism. CD3 chimerism was evaluated on days +28,
+84, and +365 (or more frequently) either by fluorescent in situ hybridization for sex-
mismatched transplants or analysis of genomic DNA for variable number of tandem repeats
for sex-matched transplants. GVHD was graded per established methods.12 Late-onset acute
GVHD was defined as any acute GVHD occurring beyond day +100. An infectious episode
was defined only if a pathogen was identified and treatment prescribed. Due to the small
sample size of this cohort, variables that may have affected outcomes were not incorporated
into a multi-variate analysis. Stopping rules for grade IV regimen-related toxicity prior to
day +28 were not met. Protocol oversight was maintained by a dedicated Data Safety
Monitoring Board which met at a minimum of every 6 months.
RESULTS
Engraftment and hematopoietic recovery
Engraftment was achieved in five of six patients, in whom three developed mixed and two
developed full donor chimerism. Median time to achieve an absolute neutrophil count of
500/mm3 was day +16 (range, +13 to +17) and platelet count >50,000/mm3 without
transfusion was day +15 (range, +14 to +18). All five patients had improvement from
baseline hematological blood counts no matter the extent of donor chimerism. Graft failure
occurred in one patient and was not rectified after a second PBSC transplant on day +34
from the same donor with no additional conditioning. However, engraftment subsequently
was achieved when the patient was conditioned with FLU and antithymocyte globulin prior
to receiving a third PBSC transplant from the same donor. He is currently alive and doing
well with ameliorated blood counts and mixed donor chimerism (Figure 1).
Regimen-related toxicity
One patient experienced nausea and vomiting related to the preparative regimen. Otherwise,
all other patients tolerated the conditioning regimen and PBSC infusion well with no
complications. No patients developed mucositis. Other than transient mild
hyperbilirubinemia in two patients (3.1 and 3.6 mg/dL) within the first 30 days after
transplant, both liver and kidney functions remained within normal limits. No other adverse
regimen-related toxicities were noted within the first 100 days after transplant.

Graft-versus-host disease
Four patients developed acute GVHD with stage II skin (n=3), stage III gut (n=1) and stage
III liver (n=1) resulting in overall grades of acute GVHD of I (n=1), II (n=2), and III (n=1).
In all cases, systemic steroids were given and the MMF taper was held. No patient
developed late-onset acute GVHD. Of the five evaluable patients, three developed refractory
chronic GVHD at 83, 84, and 102 days after HCT that required prolonged treatment with
systemic steroids as well as tertiary immunosuppressive therapy.
Infections
All three patients with chronic GVHD developed multiple episodes of late systemic
infections. Patient 1 had fifteen (bacterial, 10; viral, 4; fungal, 1) infections at a median of
293 (range, 23–690) days, Patient 5 had fourteen (bacterial, 12; viral, 2) infections at a
median of 415 (range,139–741) days, and Patient 6 had twelve (bacterial, 9; viral, 1; fungal,
2) infections at a median of 432 (range, 65–487) days after HCT. Patient 4 was treated for
one bacterial infection before being taken off study for graft rejection, while Patients 2 and
3, neither of whom developed chronic GVHD, had any documented infections.
Overall survival
With a median follow-up of 26 (16.3–68.1) months after HCT, three of six patients are alive
and well. As of last follow-up, all three remain transfusion independent and have not
developed any secondary malignancies to date, and two have discontinued all
immunosuppressive drugs.
DISCUSSION
FA is characterized by an intrinsic sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, and thereby
presents a challenging therapeutic balance between providing enough conditioning to allow
durable engraftment without promoting excessive acute toxicity. Here we studied the use of
FLU in combination with TBI in the conditioning of FA patients prior to unrelated donor
grafts. The regimen which included 2 Gy TBI was well-tolerated and engraftment was
attained in most cases. Similar to what has been reported for non-FA patients transplanted
for malignant diseases,11 these findings demonstrated that low-intensity conditioning with
FLU allowed for stable engraftment. However, chronic refractory GVHD remained a
substantial problem in our population, and novel strategies to reduce GVHD will be required
in future protocols.
Several patients developed late infections complicating their clinical course. Because most
infections were seen years following HCT and only in those patients having chronic GVHD,
it is likely that functional defects from chronic GVHD itself, as well as effects of chronic
immunosuppression, are the likely culprits rather than acute regimen-related toxicity.
The major problem identified with this regimen was the high rate of chronic GVHD, which
contributed to the deaths of three patients. The most likely etiology is the use of G-CSF-
mobilized PBSC grafts, which are associated with higher rates of chronic GVHD compared
to marrow grafts.13,14 Despite the presence of chronic GVHD and the immunological drive
of donor cells to promote GVHD in two of three patients with mixed chimerism, conversion
to full donor chimerism was not observed. The etiology of this is unclear, but similar
observations have been noted when transplanting other non-malignant diseases treated with
a conditioning regimen similar to ours.15 Of note, the long-term significance of prolonged
mixed chimerism is uncertain in FA. Theoretically, while the persistence of residual FA
cells may not necessarily affect long-term engraftment, there is concern that these cells may
transform into leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome over time. However, when evaluating

results of a joint study between our group and Curitiba, Brazil,2 of the 43 patients who
underwent HLA-matched sibling transplantation and conditioned with CY 60 mg/kg, over
half developed mixed donor-host chimerism, and to date none have developed leukemia or
MDS with a median follow-up of 6.7 (range 3.4–10.6) years (personal communication, R.
Pasquini and C. Bonfim). As the follow-up of most patients on this study is still relatively
early, such observations are interesting but the benefit of mixed chimerism cannot be
confirmed without the ongoing longitudinal follow-up. This is in contrast to what has been
reported in the natural history of FA, where without transplant, one study indicated an
actuarial risk is as high as 67% by the age of 40.16
Finally, development of chronic GVHD on our study could be attributed to the inadequacy
of early post-grafting immunosuppression. Although prolonged immunosuppression with
CSP and MMF helped establish stable engraftment in our protocol, the prevention of GVHD
will require a more aggressive elimination of actively proliferating alloreactive donor T cell
clones that emerge early after HCT. One approach worth considering would be using only
marrow grafts to reduce the number of T cells, or adding other agents to target more specific
in vivo T cell depletion, such as either adding antithymocyte globulin during conditioning,
17,18 or as shown in non-FA patients, adding a single dose of CY after HCT.19 Another
approach would be to deplete donor T cells ex vivo and infusing CD34-selected stem cells.
20 It is thus clear from our results and published studies that successor transplant trials for
FA need to incorporate more efficient T cell suppression/depletion strategies while
attempting dose de-escalation or elimination of TBI to decrease toxicity and late-effects.
Other groups have published FLU-based regimens for unrelated donors using marrow and/or
T--cell depletion methods with promising results. Wagner et al. evaluated CIBMTR registry
data demonstrating the survival advantage of FLU-based regimens.4 Yabe et al.17 reported
on 27 FA patients receiving alternative donor transplants, of which 24 received 5–6/6
unrelated donor marrow. Using a regimen containing 3–4.5 Gy thoracoabdominal irradiation
(TAI) or TBI, FLU, CY, and ATG, engraftment was seen in 26/27, acute GVHD grades II-
III in 3/26, and chronic GVHD in 8/26 patients, resulting in an overall survival of 96.3%.
Chaudhury et al.20 reported on alternative donor transplants, of which ten of 18 received
CD34+, T-cell-depleted PBSC or marrow grafts from HLA-matched or mismatched
unrelated donors preceded by 450 cGy TBI, FLU 150 mg/m2, and CY 40 mg/kg. Outcomes
for the entire group showed that all engrafted, one patient developed Grades II-III GVHD
which progressed to chronic GVHD, and the 5-year disease-free survival was 66.6%. Some
groups have also incorporated alemtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against CD52, as a
means to deplete T cells in vivo with promising results.21,22 In contrast, MacMillan et al.5
reported on a TBI dose-escalation study on which 21 of 29 patients received unrelated donor
T-cell depleted marrow grafts. Conditioning included CY 40 mg/kg, TBI 450 or 600 cGy,
and ATG. Results showed that for the entire cohort, engraftment was 63%, grades II-IV
acute GVHD was 32%, chronic GVHD 0%, and 1-year overall survival was low at 34%.
Thus, ongoing prospective trials incorporating minimally toxic yet potently
immunosuppressive strategies are necessary for successfully transplanting patients with FA.
We conclude that in patients with FA, our regimen with FLU and low dose TBI was able to
achieve stable engraftment with minimal early toxicity, but it was associated with
unacceptably high rates of chronic GVHD for this patient population.
