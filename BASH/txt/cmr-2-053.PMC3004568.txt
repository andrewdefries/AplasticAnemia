Abstract: Denileukin diftitox (Ontak®
) is indicated for the treatment of patients with persistent
or recurrent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), a rare lymphoproliferative disorder of the
skin. Denileukin diftitox was the first fusion protein toxin approved for the treatment of a human
disease. This fusion protein toxin combines the IL2 protein with diphtheria toxin, and targets the
CD25 subunit of the IL2 receptor, resulting in the unique delivery of a cytocidal agent to CD-25
bearing T-cells. Historically, immunotherapy targeting malignant T-cells including monoclonal
antibodies has been largely ineffective as cytocidal agents compared to immunotherapy directed
against B-cells such as rituximab. This review will summarize the development of denileukin
diftitox, its proposed mechanism of action, the pivotal clinical trials that led to its FDA approval,
the improvements in quality of life, and the common toxicities experienced during the treatment
of patients with CTCL. CTCL is often a chronic progressive lymphoma requiring the sequential
use of treatments such as retinoids, traditional chemotherapy, or biological response modifiers.
The incorporation of the immunotoxin denileukin diftitox into the sequential or combinatorial
treatment of CTCL will also be addressed.
Keywords: denileukin diftitox, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, fusion protein toxin
Introduction
Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) account for roughly 3% of non-Hodgkin’s lym-
phoma (NHL) and are a heterogenous group of disorders characterized by clonal accu-
mulation of malignant CD4+
or CD8+
T-lymphocytes in the skin. According to a recent
review of the SEER database and other registries, the incidence of CTCL is on the rise;
approximately 6.4 per million persons will be diagnosed with CTCL each year.1
Mycosis fungoides (MF) and its leukemic variant, Sézary syndrome (SS), make
up the majority of CTCL. Treatment algorithms have been developed for MF and
SS and include combined or sequential therapies with multiple skin-directed as well
as systemic agents.2
The NCCN and EORTC also have developed guidelines in the
management of MF and SS. Decisions in initial or subsequent therapies such as skin-
directed therapy, radiation therapy, photopheresis, anti-neoplastic therapies, biologic
therapies, or combined-modality treatment incorporate the disease stage, overall prog-
nosis, and quality-of life of the patient. For early-stage patients in whom remission is
likely, the goal of therapy is to avoid long-term treatment-related toxicities; for patients
with aggressive disease, approaches often include skin-directed as well as systemic
therapies, including biologic or targeted therapy, and chemotherapy.
Staging of patients with MF and SS is essential both for its prognostic value and for
decisions in management. The most commonly used staging system for MF/SS is based

on a tumor-node-metastasis-blood (TNMB) classification
(Table 1).3
When MF is grouped by stage, patients with
patch-plaque disease (stages IA, IB, and IIA) have an excel-
lent survival of more than 12 years; those with tumors or
erythroderma (stages IIB/III) have a median survival of
approximately 4 years; however, those with stage IV which
includes patients with lymph node or visceral involvement,
the median survival is less than 3 years.4
Similarly, SS has
a median survival of less than 3 years.5,6
Kim et al showed
that advanced age, T stage, and presence of extracutaneous
disease correlated with a reduction in survival.7
Many patients die not from their disease, but the infec-
tious complications they develop, likely due to impaired
immunity as well as from immunosuppressive effects of
systemic therapies. One unique feature of this disease is
that as the malignant T-cell clone expands, it does so at the
expense of normal T-cells, creating an immunodeficiency in
numbers of functional T-cells, as well as decreased production
of TH1-type cytokines, and decreased NK cell activity.8
An
important treatment paradigm is to introduce treatments that
do not cause further immune suppression.
Denileukin diftitox (Ontak®
; Eisai Inc.) is a biological
therapeutic agent that is essentially a fusion protein toxin.
A fusion protein toxin combines a targeting ligand such as
a growth factor with a cytocidal moiety such as a plant or
bacterial toxin. Denileukin diftitox uses a truncated diphthe-
ria toxin (DAB389) as the toxophore and this is fused to the
full-length sequence of the IL2 protein. The IL2 moiety of
the molecule directs the fusion toxin to cells bearing IL2R.
Once bound to the IL2R, denileukin diftitox is internalized
via receptor-mediated endocytosis in an acidified vesicle.
Upon internalization and acidification, denileukin diftitox
is proteolytically cleaved within the endosomes to liberate
the enzymatically active portion of the diphtheria toxin.
The fragment of diphtheria toxin is translocated across the
endosomal membrane into the cytosol where it inhibits pro-
tein synthesis via ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor-2,
ultimately resulting in cell death.9,10
The story of the birth of denileukin diftitox is an inter-
esting one, and it is worthwhile to review its development.
Denileukin diftitox was born out of the ongoing discovery
of IL2 and its receptors, and novel bioengineering.
History of IL2, IL2R, and anti-Tac
Since the cloning of the “autocrine T-cell growth factor”,
IL2, in 1983, the IL2 receptor (IL2R) has been the subject
of major investigation. Targeting of IL2R has subsequently
been explored for its therapeutic potential as well as to help
elucidate signal transduction pathways. We know now that
the IL2R is a complex comprised by three parts: the alpha
chain (CD25) which is required for high affinity binding,
the beta chain (CD122) which participates in IL2 and IL15
signal transduction, and the common gamma chain (CD132)
which participates in downstream signal transduction of IL2
and other cytokines.11–14
The generation of an anti-CD25 (anti-Tac) antibody
has helped identify populations of cells where IL2R is
expressed.15
In a normal subject, the IL2R is expressed
mostly at a low level in less than 5% of normal circulating
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). However, the

greatest level of expression of CD25 is seen in the setting
of T-cell malignancies such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma,
and adult T-cell leukemia. It is also highly expressed in
hairy cell leukemia, Hodgkin’s disease, as well as some
B-cell NHLs and histiocytic proliferations. Such observa-
tions are the basis for therapies that target IL2R-expressing
cells. Indeed, high- or intermediate affinity IL2R isoforms
are expressed in at least 50% of CTCL and 25% to 50% of
B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas when tissue is examined
by flow cytometry, and thus make the IL2R an attractive
target for therapy.16
In 1995 Sakaguchi et al discovered that the high affinity
IL2 receptor alpha chain was a reliable cell surface marker
for regulatory T-cells (Tregs).17
CD4+
CD25+
cells were found
to be anergic, failing to proliferate when stimulated by anti-
CD3 antibodies. They also suppressed the growth of CD4+
CD25–
T-cellsinvitro,aswellasanadmixtureofconventional
T-cells. Interestingly, although IL2 was required for their
growth and survival, Tregs did not produce IL2 themselves.18
Since CTCL is considered by some to be a malignant pro-
liferation of T-regs,19
the rationale behind targeting CD25 is
even more robust.
Abnormalities of IL2R were also detected in autoimmune
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythe-
matosus, aplastic anemia, and insulin-dependent diabetes.
Increased expression of  CD25 was also detected in the serum
of patients during solid organ allograft rejection, and in those
with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Since the cloning of
the IL2R receptor, work has been done to exploit the receptor
as a target for therapy in T-cell malignancies, GVHD, and
other autoimmune diseases.
Daclizumab is a humanized anti-Tac monoclonal anti-
body that has been tested in leukemia and lymphoma. In cell
lines, it was thought that daclizumab blocked the interaction
of IL2 and its receptor resulting in cytokine-deprivation-
mediated apoptotic cell death.20
Additionally, based on in vivo
data from mouse models, it was thought that daclizumab also
exerted an effect through an FcR receptor mechanism.21
Clinical trials using daclizumab in adult T-cell leukemia
and lymphoma (ATL) was associated with partial responses
predominantly in patients with smoldering or chronic ATL.
Responding patients were hypothesized to have a blockage
of the IL2–IL2R autocrine pathway.
Unfortunately, unlike other therapeutic monoclonal
antibodies used in the treatment of human malignancies,
daclizumab did not seem to have strong cytocidal activity.
Therefore, other strategies were needed to make use of IL2R
targeting in T-cell malignancies.
The IL2R-diphtheria toxin fusion
protein: DAB486-IL2
In order to target the delivery of a cytocidal moiety to IL2R-
bearing cells, human IL2 was fused to truncated diphtheria
toxin (DT). Unlike daclizumab (anti-Tac), which is a mAb
directed against the CD25 component of the receptor,
DAB486-IL2 contained the full-length sequence of IL2 as
the ligand for the IL2R. The original fusion protein toxin
used a fragment of DT containing methionine plus the first
485 amino acids of DT resulting in the molecule DAB486-
IL2.9,22,23
While this molecule had clinical activity (1 com-
plete response, 2 partial responses, out of 18 patients), the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was only 0.1 mg/kg/day, due
to transaminase elevations.24
Five of 18 patients experienced
fever associated with administration of the fusion protein
toxin that responded to acetaminophen. The anti-tumor effect
of DAB486-IL2 did not correlate with pre- or post-treatment
antibodies to DT, DAB486-IL2, or IL2.
Denileukin diftitox (DAB 389-IL2)
Modifications were made to DAB 486-IL2 by removing
97 amino acids from the native part of the toxin containing
the disulfide bond, resulting in an increase in half-life and
tolerance in animals. This resulted in a 5-fold greater affinity
for IL2R and a 10-fold increase in potency.25,26
The resulting
DAB389-IL2 fusion protein toxin is otherwise known as
denileukin diftitox.
Denileukin diftitox binds to IL2R in the same way as IL2
because it contains the full-length sequence of IL2. This opti-
mized fusion protein toxin binds to a high- or intermediate-
affinity receptor.27,28
Intermediate affinity receptors have
beta (CD122) and gamma (CD132) subunits and bind IL2
with Kd ∼10–9
, and high-affinity receptors have the addition
of the alpha (CD25) subunit and bind IL2 with Kd ∼10–11
.
Once denileukin diftitox binds to IL2R, this molecule is
internalized into the cell where the truncated diphtheria
toxin is cleaved off, liberated into the cytosol, and induces
cell death by causing apoptosis.
A phase I clinical trial using DAB389-IL2 in patients with
lymphomas expressing IL2R (CD25 or CD122) resulted in
an MTD of 27 µg/kg/day.25
Unlike with the first generation
fusion protein toxin, changes in liver function tests were not
dose-limiting. The dose-limiting toxicities that were seen
included asthenia, fever, nausea and vomiting. In addition,
some of the CTCL patients who were treated in this trial
exhibited signs and symptoms of capillary leak syndrome
with edema, hypotension and hypoalbuminemia. Again, the

presence of antibodies to DT, DAB389-IL2, or IL2 pre- and
post-treatment did not prevent treatment responses. The
half-life of DAB 389-IL2 was found to be 72 minutes with
monophasic clearance, and there was no dose accumulation
with repeated doses of the drug.
In this trial, 35 patients had CTCL (30 MF, 4 large cell
CTCL, and 1 cutaneous PTCL), and most were heavily pre-
treated. Of the 35 CTCL patients, 4 (11%) had a complete
response, and 8 (24%) had a partial response. The median
time to response was 2 months and the duration response
ranged from 2 to 39+ weeks (median 10 months). There
was no obvious correlation with the expression of CD122
or CD132.25
In another phase I/II trial using DAB 389-IL2 that
enrolled a more homogenous group of 35 patients with
MF, a dose and schedule of DAB 389-IL2 given over
5 consecutive days of a 21-day cycle was explored. Thirteen
patients (37%) achieved an objective response, including a
complete response in 5 patients (14%). Complete response
was achieved in patients with extensive erythroderma and
tumor-stage mycosis fungoides.29
A smaller trial of 4 heavily pre-treated CTCL patients
who received either 9 (1 patient) or 18 (3 patients) µg/kg/day
of DAB 389-IL2 for 5 days of a 21-day cycle showed
striking results.30
One patient achieved a complete patho-
logical response, and another patient had a complete clinical
response, and the other 2 patients had partial responses.
Similar to prior trials, the duration of response ranged from
5 to 11+ months. There was significant improvement in the
symptoms and quality of life in these patients.
These trials formed the basis of the pivotal phase III
trial of denileukin diftitox.31
This randomized, blinded, mul-
ticenter, parallel group study was designed to evaluate the
efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of two doses of deni-
leukin diftitox in patients with previously treated, advanced
or refractory CTCL. The inclusion criteria required that
patients have 20% of lymphocytes within the skin biopsy
stain positive for CD25. Patients were randomized to receive
either denileukin diftitox 9 or 18 µg/kg/day administered
on 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles, and
were stratified by stage (ie, IIA or IIB). All patients
were monitored for toxicity and clinical efficacy, the latter
being assessed by changes in disease burden and quality of
life measurements.
The study enrolled 71 patients, and 48 (68%) had
advanced disease (stage IIB or greater). Overall, 21 (30%)
of the 71 patients with CTCL treated with denileukin diftitox
had an objective response (20% partial response and 10%
complete response). There was no difference in the overall
response rate between the 9 or 18 µg/kg/day cohorts; how-
ever, a subset analysis of patients with stage IIB disease or
higher, showed a trend towards higher response (P = 0.07).
Quality-of-life improvements following denileukin diftitox
therapy were seen both in responders and in nonresponders,
and this was mainly a result of clinical improvements in
pruritus in 68% of the patients. In patients who responded,
the use of rescue medications such as topical steroids or oral
antihistamines was also decreased.
Fifty of the 71 patients were classified as nonresponders;
however only 2 (3%) of patients had progression of disease.
The remainder of the patients had stable disease (32%), or
withdrew due to intolerance to the therapy (35%) before
they could be assessed. The authors commented that even
in patients who were classified as stable disease, had a signifi­
cant initial response to therapy.
It is again noteworthy that the majority of patients had
detectable levels of antidenileukin diftitox and/or anti-
IL2 after treatment with denileukin diftitox, however, the
presence of these antibodies did not impair the response
to treatment. Curiously, higher antidenileukin diftitox anti-
body levels were associated with a lower incidence of rash,
hypoalbuminemia, and transaminase elevations, but did not
correspond to infusion-related reactions. It is thought that
the development of antibodies to denileukin diftitox may
contribute to the increase in clearance of denileukin diftitox
that was observed by cycle 3.
Negro-Vilar et al reported preliminary results of a
placebo-controlled phase III trial of up to 8 cycles of deni-
leukin diftitox in 144 patients with stage IA to III disease, the
largest CTCL trial to date.32
Patients with at least 3 prior treat-
ments were included. Overall response rates for the placebo,
low-dose (9 µg/kg), and high-dose (18 µg/kg) treatment
arms were 16%, 38%, and 49%, respectively, with median
times to progression of 4, 26, and greater than 32 months,
respectively. In an unpublished meta-analysis of three
phase III clinical trials of denileukin diftitox for the treatment
ofCTCL,Negro-Vilar also reported there was no correlation
between CD25 expression and response.33
Denileukin diftitox in combination
treatments
Since the expression of IL2R has been largely thought to be
important in T-cell targeting of denileukin diftitox, strategies
to upregulate IL2R expression have been explored. Retinoids
have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of MF/SS and
have antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, immune-modulating,

and cellular effects.34
In vitro studies demonstrated that the
retinoid × receptor (RXR) retinoid, bexarotene, at biologically
relevant concentrations of 10(-6) M to 10(-8) M, upregulated
boththep55andp75subunitso f theIL2Randthesusceptibility
of T-cell leukemia cells to denileukin diftitox.35,36
In a phase I
dose-escalation trial, denileukin diftitox 18 µg/kg × 3 days
was administered in combination with oral bexarotene
(75 to 300 mg/day) every 21 days to patients with relapsed
or refractory MF/SS.36
The overall response rate was 70%,
and responders included patients who had stable disease or
no response on denileukin diftitox alone. CD25 expression
on CD4+
cells was measured by immunohistochemistry or
flow cytometry at baseline and after 7 days of bexarotene.
Modulation of the IL2R was seen with doses of bexarotene
150 mg daily and higher. All 4 patients who achieved a CR
and 1 of 3 patients who achieved a PR had evidence of 50%
upregulation after bexarotene treatment. The combination
was tolerated well with no overlapping adverse events.
Arginine butyrate is a histone deacetylase (HDAC)
inhibitor that also has been shown to increase IL2R-beta
(CD122) subunit gene and protein expression.37
While low
dose arginine butyrate showed no growth inhibitor effect of
its own, combination studies with denileukin diftitox in vitro
showed an increase in cytotoxicity. Since HDAC inhibitors
are clinically active compounds in CTCL, combination
therapies to test potential synergism with denileukin diftitox
are warranted.
Improvements of quality of life
CTCL affects numerous dimensions of quality of life (QOL)
due to relentless painful, pruritic and disfiguring lesions.
QOL was evaluated as a secondary endpoint in heavily pre-
treated advanced and/or recurrent CTCL patients enrolled
in the multicenter randomized phase III trial of denileukin
diftitox by Olsen et al using the Functional Assessment of
Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scale.31,38
FACT-G was
developed to measure health-related QOL in patients with
cancer.39
This tool measures four domains of quality of life:
physical, functional, social and emotional well-being, as well
as patient-physician relationships. The physical well-being
scale assesses energy level, pain and side effects of treat-
ment. Relationships with family and friends are addressed
in the social well-being subscale. The emotional well-being
subscale evaluates for anxiety and depression. The ability
to sleep, work and participate in desired leisure activities
are addressed in the functional well-being subscale. The
relationship-with-physician subscale measures satisfaction
with interaction and care provided by the physician.
In the study by Olsen et al the 71 patients who received
denileukin diftitox were administered the FACT-G question-
naire at baseline prior to the start of therapy and prior to
each treatment cycle. In addition, along with each FACT-G
measurement, patients were asked to rate the appearance
of their skin on a 7-point global severity scale. Because the
symptom of pruritus was not specifically addressed in the
physical well-being subscale of the FACT-G, patients were
also asked to rate severity of pruritus on a 10-cm visual
analog scale.38
In the 21 patients who achieved a complete or partial
response to denileukin diftitox, the FACT-G and most indi-
vidual subscale scores improved during the study period
reaching statistical significance by cycle 3 (P  0.05) and
were significantly higher than scores of non-responders at
the completion of the study (P  0.041).38
Additionally for
responders, skin and pruritus severity scores showed sig-
nificant improvement at study end compared with baseline
measurements. Nonresponders also showed brief improve-
ment in QOL while receiving denileukin diftitox, but this
declined with the discontinuation of therapy.
Management of toxicities
Overall, the most commonly reported adverse events (AE)
in the pivotal study by Olsen et al were flu-like symptoms
(85%). These reactions generally improved with an anti-
pyretic, antiemetic, and/or antidiarrheal treatment. Other
common AEs were acute hypersensitivity-type reactions,
asthenia, nausea/vomiting (which led to dehydration in some
patients), and infectious complications. The frequency of
hypersensitivity reactions that occurred during or within
24 hours of drug administration was 60% and improved with
steroid, antihistamine, and acetaminophen pre-medication
prior to subsequent cycles. It should be noted that routine
pre-medication was prohibited in this study. In clinical use,
the routine use of pre-medication does reduce this complica-
tion significantly, however. The incidence of serious infusion
reactions across 3 clinical studies (n = 234 patients) was
8.1%. Various pre-medication protocols have been proposed
including one by Dang et al40
and consists of dexamethasone
4 mg iv, diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg iv, and acetaminophen
650 mg po.
Vascular leak syndrome was reported in 25% of patients
and was defined as hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and
peripheral edema. The vascular leak syndrome occurred
within the first 14 days of treatment and was usually self-
limited. Patients responded well to judicious use of diuretics
for edema, and slow hydration for hypotension. Serum

albumin 3 g/dL and pre-exisiting edema seemed to predict
the development of vascular leak syndrome. The authors
recommend an additional clinical evaluation of the patient
for changes in weight and fluid shifts at least one time within
the first 10 days after treatment begins. The US Food and
Drug Administration boxed warning states that denileukin
diftitox should only be administered in a facility equipped
and staffed for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
All adverse events in the pivotal phase III study were
most severe during the first two cycles of treatment and
then diminished significantly. Hepatic transaminase levels
were commonly elevated, with 19% of patients experiencing
grade 3–4 elevations. Most elevations were observed during
the first therapy cycle and diminished during all subsequent
cycles. Mild elevations in creatinine were noted rarely and
were reversible. There was no significant bone marrow sup-
pression, although lymphocyte counts fluctuated transiently
in 70% of patients. Infections were reported but were con-
sidered typical infections of CTCL patients, and not related
to denileukin diftitox.
Postmarketing reports of serious events include thyrotoxi-
cosis as reported by Ghori et al41
Clinical thyrotoxicosis was
described in 8 patients treated at a single center; 4 patients
developed thyrotoxicosis within days of the first cycle of
denileukin diftitox therapy, and 4 patients after the second
cycle. Symptoms of tremor, tachycardia, nausea, diarrhea,
and weight loss should trigger suspicion of this condition
which resolves after drug discontinuation. Subsequent
clinical hypothyroidism developed in 5 of these patients
requiring thyroid replacement therapy. Loss of visual acuity
and color vision is another black box warning and may have
to do with retinal changes, however the mechanism of this
rare phenomenon is not known.42
Lastly, rhabdomyolysis
has been reported in the context of severe vascular leak,43
and the authors also have independently experienced this
complication in two of their patients.
Conclusion
Denileukin diftitox has made great strides in the treatment
of CTCL since its development 20 years ago. The reported
response rates range from 30% to 50%, and treatment defi-
nitely improves the quality of life of these patients. However,
some questions still remain.
The optimal time to use denileukin diftitox is not well
defined. The toxicity profile and unfavorable schedule of
administration have prevented its use as upfront treatment,
however, denileukin diftitox may be more effective if used
earlier in the course of the disease. While the initial response
rate of denileukin diftitox was 38% in early-stage CTCL, the
median number of prior treatments was five. In less heavily
treated patients, however, the response rate was considerably
higher, 63% and 48%, for early and late stage CTCL, respec-
tively. This suggests that the response rate may be higher in
patients who are treated earlier in the course of their disease.
We are only now beginning to understand how to utilize
denilekin diftitox in combination therapy. A combination trial
of denileukin diftitox with bexarotene has shown increased
activity over monotherapy. Due to non-overlapping toxicity
profiles, denileukin diftitox has also been successfully been
combined with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubin, vin-
cristine and prednisone) for peripheral T-cell lymphoma, sug-
gesting that chemotherapy combinations that incorporate this
immunotoxin may eventually have a place in the treatment
of advanced CTCL. It would also be useful to predict which
patients would benefit most from treatment with denileukin
diftitox. Initally, it was thought that the presence of CD25
was required for entry of the drug into the malignant T-cells,
however, recent evidence has shown durable responses in
patients with CD25− disease. Regardless of these limitations,
this unique immunotoxin has proven itself effective for the
treatment of CTCL, a chronic disease with considerable
morbidity and mortality.
