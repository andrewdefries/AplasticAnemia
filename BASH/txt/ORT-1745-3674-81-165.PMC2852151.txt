Background and purpose Total hip arthroplasties in young
patients have lower long-term survival rates than in older patients.
We evaluated the use of a unique treatment protocol in patients
aged between 40 and 50 years. In all cases we used a cemented
THA, and for acetabular deficiencies we also used impacted bone
grafts together with a cemented cup.
Methods In 140 consecutive patients who were between 40 and
50 years of age at index surgery, 168 cemented total hip prostheses
were evaluated after a mean follow-up time of 10 (2–19) years.
Acetabular deficiencies were reconstructed with wire meshes and
impacted bone grafts with a cemented cup (70 hips). During fol-
low-up, 18 patients died (27 hips); in this group 3 hips (3 patients)
had been revised. None of the patients were lost to follow-up. In all
surviving patients, clinical assessment was performed with hip-
score questions and all radiographs were evaluated.
Results All clinical questionnaires showed an improved clinical
hip score. 29 hips (17%) were revised after a mean of 8 (0.3–18)
years. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a survival of 88%
(95% CI: 82–94) after 10 years with revision of either component
for any reason. Survival with endpoint revision for aseptic loosen-
ing of either component was 94% (95% CI: 90–99) after 10 years.
Interpretation Cemented implants in young patients have sat-
isfying long-term results. Reconstruction of acetabular deficien-
cies with impacted bone grafts show promising results.

The outcome of total hip arthroplasty in patients who are
less than 50 years old is less favorable than in older patients
(Learmonth et al. 2007). Thus, many designs and modifica-
tions have been tried during the past 25 years to improve the
outcome in younger patients, including cemented hips, unce-
mented hips, hybrids, and resurfacing hip arthroplasty.
We have also used cemented total hip implants with a metal-
on-polyethylene bearing in younger patients. In cases of loss
of acetabular bone stock, which is common in these patients,
we have reconstructed the bone defects using bone impaction
grafting and a cemented cup. We have consequently used this
method for the last 30 years, which guarantees no selection
bias using. Being a referral center, we accept all patients, we
do not refer any, and we do not perform surgery on patients
who are part of this cohort outside our center.
We analyzed the outcome for all patients who were between
40 and 50 years of age at the time of surgery, over a 16-year
period.
Patients and methods
Patients
All patients aged between 40 and 50 years who underwent a
primary THA at our department between January 1988 and
July 2004 were included in the study. All indications were
included, with the exception of oncological cases. We only
used cemented THAs, and in cases with acetabular deficien-
cies these defects were reconstructed with bone impaction
grafting together with a cemented cup. 168 consecutive hips in
140 patients (74 females) were operated (Table 1). 28 patients
had a bilateral THA. The mean age at index surgery was 46
(40–49) years. 58 patients were class A, 13 were class B, 49
were class BB, and 48 were class C according to the modified
Charnley classification (Roder et al. 2006).
During follow-up, 18 patients died (27 hips), none of which
were due to causes related to the arthroplasty. All of these
patients were followed until death, and their data are included.
2 patients (2 hips) were unable to have a clinical and radio-
graphic review; both were interviewed by telephone and stated
that the hip was functioning well. The mean follow-up time
for all patients was 9.7 (2.0–19.3) years. The mean follow-up
time for patients who were available for review (deceased and
revised patients excluded) was 10.3 (2.7–19.3) years.

Implants
We used only cemented implants. Femoral stems inserted
were: Exeter (n = 75) (Stryker Howmedica, Newbury, UK),
Charnley/Charnley Elite/Charnley Elite+ (n = 22, 31, and 23,
respectively) (DePuy, Leeds, UK) and the Müller Straight
Stem (n = 17) (Sulzer, Wintherthür, Switzerland). The Charn-
ley stems were the only collared stems used. Mean follow-up
times were 16 years for the Müller implants, 12 years for the
Charnley implants, and 6 years for the Exeter implants.
The acetabular components used were: Exeter/Contempo-
rary cups with an inner diameter of 28 mm (n = 63) and 22
mm (n = 1) (Stryker Howmedica), Charnley/Charnley Elite/
Charnley Elite+/Ogee cups with an inner diameter of 22.225
mm (n = 10) or 28 mm (n = 72) (DePuy) and Müller cups
with an inner diameter of 28 mm (n = 3) and 32 mm (n = 19)
(Sulzer). All cups were made of conventional high-molecular-
weight polyethylene and all femoral heads were made of a
cobalt-chrome alloy; no metal-backed liners or ceramic femo-
ral heads were used.
72 hips (43%) had an acetabular deficiency. According to
the AAOS classification (D’Antonio et al. 1989), 19 hips had
a segmental defect (type I), 41 had a cavitair defect (type II),
and 12 had a combined segmental and cavitair defect (type
III).
Surgery
All patients were given antibiotics prophylactically before
surgery. All operations but one were performed using a pos-
terolateral approach, the exception being anterolateral. No
trochanteric osteotomies were performed. Of the 72 hips with
acetabular deficiencies, in 70 the defect was reconstructed
with bone impaction grafting and, if indicated, metal meshes
(Schreurs et al. 2001). In 2 hips with segmental rim defects,
the defect was reconstructed with a solid graft. In 2 cases only
allograft was used because the femoral head was not suitable
for grafting; in 67 cases autograft was used; in 3 cases both
allograft and autograft were used because of an extensive ace-
tabular defect.
Both prosthetic components were inserted with second- or
third-generation cementing techniques with vacuum-mixed
antibiotic-loaded cement, cement pressurizing with a cement
gun, pulse lavage, and a distal intramedullary femoral plug.
Patients with large acetabular reconstructions were mobi-
lized with partial weight bearing, which was increased to full
weight bearing after 12 weeks. Cases of extensive acetabular
reconstruction had a bed-rest period of up to 6 weeks. Postop-
eratively, patients received oral anticoagulants for 3 months
or low-molecular-weight heparin for 6 weeks. NSAIDs were
given to prevent heterotopic ossification.
Clinical evaluation
All patients were followed periodically at our outpatient clinic
with an interview, a physical examination, and radiographs.
Clinical outcome was evaluated with several questionnaires:
the Harris hip score (HHS) (Harris 1969), the Oxford hip
questionnaire score (OHQS, since 1998) (Dawson et al. 1996)
and visual analog scales (VAS, 0–100) assessing pain at rest,
pain during physical activities (worst score 100), and satisfac-
tion (best score 100). Clinical questionnaires were obtained by
independent researchers at our outpatient clinic.
Radiographic evaluation
The pre- and postoperative anteroposterior and lateral radio-
graphs of every patient were assessed for position (Salvati et al.
1976), incorporation of grafts, acetabular defects (D’Antonio
et al. 1989), position of wire meshes, heterotopic ossifications
(Brooker et al. 1973), polyethylene wear (Dorr and Wan 1996),
rounding-off of the calcar, and radiolucent lines. Loosening of
the cup was defined as a demarcation in ≥ 2 zones around the
acetabular component of ≥ 2 mm, progressive demarcation,
component migration of ≥ 3 mm, component tilting of ≥ 8°,
and/or cement or prosthesis fracture. We recorded the acetabu-
lar radiographic changes according to the zones of DeLee and
Charnley (1976). Determination of cup migration was mea-
sured in relation to the inter-teardrop line instead of the Kohler
line (Goodman et al. 1988). Definite loosening of the stem was
defined according the criteria of Harris et al. (1982). Femoral
radiographic changes were recorded using the Gruen zones.All
measurements were corrected for radiographic magnification.

Statistics
Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival analysis was used to calcu-
late survival rates. Endpoints used for survival analysis were:
revision for any reason, revision for any reason excluding
infections, revision for aseptic loosening, and radiographic
loosening. Survival rates were calculated for the whole THA
and for the cup and stem separately. The survival rates at 10
and 12.5 years are reported, because until 12.5 years more
than 25% of the patients still remained in the study popula-
tion. The Student t-test and chi-squared test were also used.
For finding differences in survival, the log-rank test was used.
A p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Clinical results
All postoperative scores for the clinical questionnaires
improved. The median HHS improved from 51 (2–79) points
(n = 110) to 94 (10–100) points (n = 126) (p < 0.001). The
median OHQs (best score is 12 and the worst score is 60)
improved from 38 (12–57) points (n = 24) to 16 (12–45) points
(n = 121) (p < 0.001). The median postoperative VAS scores
for pain at rest, pain during physical activity, and satisfaction
were 0 (0–80) points (n =126), 0 (0–90) points (n = 126), and
100 (0–100) points (n = 124), respectively.
Revisions
After a mean follow-up of 9.7 (2–19.3) years, 29 hips (17%)
were revised (Table 2). Mean time to revision was 8.1 (0.3–
18.4) years. The main reasons for revision were septic loosen-
ing (n = 5), recurrent dislocation (n = 5), and aseptic loosening
(n = 15). No statistically significant differences were found
between the cups with and without impacted bone grafts in
terms of time to revision and the number of revisions. Remark-
ably, all the hips revised for septic loosening and all the cups
revised because of recurrent dislocations were THAs without
an acetabular reconstruction. Of the hips revised because of
infection, only 1 patient had had an infection within 2 years
(at 0.9 years). All other revisions were performed because of
late infections. 2 stems fractured: in 1 case an Exeter stem
and in the other a Charnley Elite stem. In one patient with a
high dislocation of the hip because of developmental dyspla-
sia (Figure 1A), an acetabular reconstruction was performed
at the original center of rotation and the cup was distalized
(Figure 1B). As a result of this distalization, tension on the
sciatic nerve resulted in a persistent sensory and motor defi-
cit. After 2.4 years, the cup was revised to a higher position
(Figure 1C) and the neurological deficit partly recovered. The
percentages of revisions were spread equally over time for
both implant types and diagnoses.
Radiographic results
For 2 patients, the most recent radiograph was missing. 23
hips were radiographically loose. In 16 of these cases the cup,
in 6 cases the stem, and in 1 case both stem and cup were
loose. 18 were revised.
The average wear in the non-revised hips was 0.11 (0.00–
1.23) mm/year and the average wear in the revised hips was
0.26 (0.00–1.04) mm/year (p < 0.001). Excessive wear of
> 0.1 mm/year was observed in 77 hips (23 revised and 54
unrevised) (p < 0.001). The wear for cups reconstructed with
impacted bone grafts and for cups implanted without bone
grafts was similar. An abnormal position of the cup was not
associated with higher wear. Radiographically loose cups
showed higher wear rates than radiographically stable cups
(mean 0.23 vs. 0.13 mm/year) (p = 0.01).
All grafts became incorporated and none showed signs of
osteolysis. However, in some cases the meshes used blurred
the examination of incorporation of the grafts. Cups recon-
structed with impacted bone grafts showed less radiolucent
lines and less acetabular osteolysis. 51 hips had heterotopic
ossification: 25 of Brooker class I, 16 of class II, and 10 of
class III.
Complications
In addition to the 5 revisions done for recurrent dislocation,
14 other patients (8%) had 1 or more hip dislocations; all of
these were treated nonoperatively. 2 patients had pain and lim-
ited hip motion, and had heterotopic ossifications excised. 4
patients had temporary nerve palsies (3 cases with develop-
mental dysplasia of the hips and 1 case after septic coxitis
in childhood). A postoperative superficial wound infection
occurred in 4 patients and healed with antibiotics. In 1 case,
a postoperative hematoma was evacuated because of pressure
on the sciatic nerve. Cement that had leaked through DHS
screw holes at the greater trochanter was removed because of
pain in 1 patient.
Survival analysis
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with revision of any compo-
nent for any reason as endpoint gave survival rates of 88%
at 10 years and 80% at 12.5 years (Table 3). When infec-
tions were excluded, the survival rates increased to 91% at
10 years and 83% at 12.5 years. Survival with revision of any

component for aseptic loosening as endpoint was 94% at 10
years and 89% at 12.5 years (Figure 2). There were no statisti-
cally significant differences in survival between the different
Charnley classifications. With the endpoints revision for any
reason and revision for aseptic loosening, the survival rates
were similar in patients with bilateral or unilateral THA (p =
0.3 and p = 0.5); thus, no outcome bias concerning bilateral or
unilateral THA was present (Bryant et al. 2006).
Discussion
We believe that our findings are relevant and reliable because
this was a large series of consecutive total hip implantations
with no patients lost during follow-up (Murray et al. 1997).
The approach used was the only one, so no selection bias was
created. Our study is not a single-surgeon study, however; the
operations were performed by several surgeons.
One limitation of our study was the short follow-up in some
patients. Another limitation is that we used different kinds of

implants over time; however, all were cemented with a full
polyethylene cup. The Exeter stems had shorter follow-up;
thus, the long-term follow-up mostly depended on the results
of the Charnley and Müller implants. Nowadays, we only
use the Exeter stem and Exeter/Contemporary cups routinely
in primary THA, and also Müller (32-mm) cups in revision
arthroplasties. Because of the wide range of sizes and offsets
of the Exeter stem, no custom-made implants are necessary.
Several studies have shown that an acetabular reconstruc-
tion with bone impaction grafting creates a unique bone-
cement-cup interface (Heekin et al. 1995, van der Donk et al.
2002). This could be an explanation for the smaller amount of
radiolucent lines we found in the cups reconstructed with bone
impaction grafting, as also reported by De Kam et al. (2009).
Notably, the outcome in our patients who had a cemented
THA and cups reconstructed with bone impaction grafting
are similar to the results of Charnley THA in older patients
(Garellick et al. 1994, Kerboull et al. 2004, Buckwalter et al.
2006, Hulleberg et al. 2008).
Good results of cemented THA, all with the original Charn-
ley prosthesis, in patients under the age of 40 with a mean
follow-up time of longer than 10 years vary between 85% and
93% survival (Joshi et al. 1993, Sochart and Porter 1997, Gar-
cia-Cimbrelo et al. 2000, Chiu et al. 2001). In another study,
the survival of cemented Charnley-Kerboull THA in patients
under and over the age of 40 was the same (90% vs. 89% at 20
years) (Kerboull et al. 2004).
We have not found any reports on uncemented implants in
patients under the age of 40 with a mean follow-up longer
than 10 years and with a survival rate of more than 90% at
10 years, with revision for any reason of any component as
endpoint. If the age limit is increased to include patients under
50, only 1 study has reported a survival rate of > 90% after
10 years of custom-made uncemented implants in 33 patients
(McCullough et al. 2006). McAuley et al. (2004) reported
85% survival at 10 years with revision of any component for
any reason as endpoint, in patients under 40 years of age after
a mean follow-up time of 7 years. In a study on uncemented
THA in patients < 55 years old in the Finnish Arthroplasty
Register, the survival of different kinds of uncemented THAs
at 10 years varied between 62% and 86% (Eskelinen et al.
2006).
In a meta-analysis of published literature comparing
cemented and uncemented THA (Morshed et al. 2007), no
advantage was found in either procedure when failure was
defined as revision of any component or revision of one spe-
cific component. These authors did find a superior survival
with cemented fixation in studies that included patients of all
ages as compared to studies that only included patients who
were 55 years of age or younger.
Higher wear rates and higher revision rates in young patients
have been partly attributed to higher activity levels (Zahiri
et al. 1998, Schmalzried and Huk 2004). We found similar
survival rates in the different Charnley categories. However,
we did not assess activity levels with proven methods such as
questionnaires or accelerometers.
Despite the fact that our clinic is a training university hos-
pital and that these institutions are known to have higher revi-
sion rates (Espehaug et al. 1999), our results are similar to
those obtained with the Charnley cemented THA in younger
patients. Our results highlight the value of cemented THA in
this age-specific patient population. Reconstruction of ace-
tabular defects with bone impaction grafting appears to be a
promising technique.
