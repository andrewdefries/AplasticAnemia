Cell-mediated immunity against polymorphic minor histocompatibility (mH) an-
tigens is assumed to contribute to the development ofgraft-vs.-host disease (GVHD)
and graft rejection in recipients of HLA-identical marrow grafts (1). Although the
effector cell mechanisms underlying both events are not completely understood, it
can be anticipated that the ultimate effect of T lymphocytes directed against mH
antigens depends on the tissue distribution of these molecules.
One ofthe most extensively studied mH antigens is the male-specific antigen H-Y,
which was first discovered as a transplantation barrier in a murine skin graft model
by Eichwald and Slimser (2). In the mouse as well as in man the immune response
to the HY antigen appears to be mainly, though not exclusively, mediated by MHC-
restricted T cells (3-5). This poses major limits to the possibilities to perform tissue
distribution studies for the human HY antigen, which thus depend on the usage
of cellular techniques such as cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In 1977, Goulmy and co-
workers isolated HLA class I-restricted CTLs specific for H-Y from a female patient
after rejection of a marrow graft from her HLA-identical male sibling (5). This was
actually the first report suggesting a role for the HY antigen in human bone marrow
transplantation. In line with this notion, Storb et al. (6) and Kernan et al. (7) identified
male donor sex as a risk factor for graft rejection and failure in transplantation for
aplastic anemia and following T cell depletion. Recently, the role of HY in graft
rejection was further clarified by Voogt et al. (8) who demonstrated that destruction
of male hematopoietic progenitor cells can occur via H-Y-specific cytolysis.
Accordingly, cellular typing for the HY antigen on human skin cells may lead
to a better understanding of the mechanism of GVHD. Human skin is extremely
vulnerable to cell-mediated immunity during GVHD. In particular, young epidermal
keratinocytes seem to be targeted in situ (9). In this article we have used different
H-Y-specific CTL clones and cultured human keratinocytes as an in vitro model
to investigate the susceptibility of male skin cells to H-Y-mediated cytolysis. In con-
trast to what has been found in the mouse (l0), our results demonstrate that HY
determinants in the human skin are functionally accessible to CTLs. Conceivably,

the H-Y antigen can serve as a target structure in the local anti-host immune re-
sponse during GVHD.
Materials and Methods
CTL Clones. The CTL clones, which were obtained by limiting dilution, were an allo-
HLA-A2-specific clone designated IE2 derived from an in vitro MLR (11), an HLA-A2-re-
stricted, HYspecific CTL clone"IR35,"and an HLA-B7-restricted, H-Y-specific CTL clone
"5W4," both obtained from the peripheral blood of in vivo sensitized female patients (12).
Keratinocyte Cultures. Epidermal keratinocytes were obtained from three healthy volunteers
(donor 1, male, HLA-Al,-A2,-B8,-B15; donor 2, male, HLA-A3,-A9,-B7,-B40; donor 3, fe-
male, HLA-A2,-A29,-B7,-B57) and were cultured using a Rheinwald-Green feederlayer tech-
nique (13) with small modifications (14).
Chromium-release Assay. Control cellular typing for HLA-A2 and H-Y of the skin donors
was performed using their T lymphoblasts as target cells in a standard "Cr-release assay
(15). Clone IE2 (i.e., HLA-A2 specific) significantly lysed lymphoblasts obtained from donors
1 and 3, clone IR35 (i.e., A2/HY specific) lysed lymphoblasts from donor 1, whereas clone
.5W4 (i.e., B7/HY specific) lysed lymphoblasts from donor 2 (data shown in the legends to
Figs. 1 and 2, and to Table I). Keratinocytes from these donors were used as target cells in
a modified 4-h "Cr-release assay (de Bueger, M. M., C. A. C. M. van Els, J. Kempenaar,
M. Ponec, and E. Goulmy, manuscript submitted for publication). Briefly, keratinocytes from
subconfluent cultures were harvested and dispensed at 10,000 cells per well in 96-well flat-
bottomed microtiter plates and allowed to attach for 48 h, either in the presence or absence
of 250 U IFN-y/ml for the last 18 h. Approximately 15% of the cells adhered. While ad-
herent, keratinocytes were labeled and incubated in five replicate wells in the presence (E)
or absence (S) ofdifferent numbers ofeffector cells, and in the presence of 1 % Triton X-100
(M). Standard deviations of replicates were <15% and spontaneous release levels were be-
tween 10 and 20%. Specific cytolysis was calculated according to the amount of isotope released
in E, S, and M in the following formula; [(E-S)l(M-S)] x 100%.
Results and Discussion
Detection of HLAA2. Since the expression of MHC class I is a prerequisite for
H-Y detection with the H-Y-specific CTLs, we first explored the cellular recognition
of the HLA-A2 antigen on cultured keratinocytes using the HLA-A2-specific CTL
clone IE2. As is illustrated in Fig. 1 a, keratinocytes of the HLA-A2 +ve donors 1
and 3 were lysed in a dose-dependent manner, whereas keratinocytes of the HLA-
A2-ve donor 2 were not. Herewith, the HLA allotyping on keratinocytes fully cor-
responded to typing on PHA blasts of the same individuals (see legend to Fig. 1).
After treatment with IFN-'y (250 U/ml 18 h) the HLA-A2-specific lysis of keratino-
cytes from the HLA-A2 +ve donors 1 and 3 was significantly enhanced (Fig. 1 b).
Thus, in vitro cultured human keratinocytes are susceptible to cell-mediated lysis
against major alloantigens.
Detection ofA2/H-Y. We then established the cytotoxic activity ofthe HLA-A2-re-
stricted, HYspecific CTL clone IR35 on keratinocytes ofdonors 1, 2, and 3 (Table
I). In two of three experiments, 19-23% of H-Y killing was observed of untreated
keratinocytes ofthe HLA-A2 +ve male donor 1 ; in one ofthree experiments no lysis
was obtained. Unstimulated keratinocytes from the HLA-A2 -ve male donor 2 and
the HLA-A2 +ve female donor 3 were not lysed. After preincubation ofthe keratino-
cytes with IFN-y (250 U/ml/18 h), H-Y-specific cytolysis of the HLA-A2 +ve male
keratinocytes of donor 1 was dramatically enhanced whereas no aspecific lysis of
the other keratinocytes was induced.
Detection of B7/H-Y. To confirm the expression of the cellularly defined HY an-

tigen on keratinocytes in conjunctionwith another restriction element, we performed
a similar set of experiments using the HYspecific, HLA-B7-restricted CTL clone

ever, after IFN-y pretreatment, keratinocytes of the HLA-B7+ve male donor 2, but
not of the HLA-B7-ve male donor 1 and the HLA-B7 +ve female donor 3, were
rendered susceptible to HY-mediated lysis (Fig. 2 b).
This study for the first time clearly demonstrates that the H-Y antigen can be cel-
lularly detected on human keratinocytes by conventional H-Y-specific CTL clones.
Furthermore, the recognition of HY was shown to take place in the context of two

different HLA class I antigens. The implications of these findings are twofold. First,
the recognition of H-Y on keratinocytes through H-Y-specific CTL clones, which
were induced and selected using APCs of lymphoid origin, implies that the cellu-
larly defined human HI'/class I structure apparently adopts asimilar antigenic configu-
ration on these different cell types. In mice, the same could be concluded from ex-
periments carried out in the opposite direction, namely that by in vivo immunization
for H-Y using male keratinocytes, CTLs were obtained that were capable of lysing
male spleen cells (10). Second, the demonstration that destruction of keratinocytes
can occur by H-Y-specific cytolysis clearly sustains the role of HY as a target cell
structure in the epidermal effector phase of GVHD.
In the mouse, a role for mH antigen-specific CTL as proximal mediators in al-
lograft immunity has strongly been promoted by the work of Steinmuller and col-
leagues on the skin-specific mH antigen Epa-1 (16, 17). These investigators reported
the in vivo isolation of H-2-restricted, Epa-1-specific CTL lysing epidermal cells,
fibroblasts, and activated macrophages while unafecting lymphocyte targets. Epa-
1-specific CTL could induce GVHD-like skin lesions when inoculated into the ap-
propriate hosts. Unlike in the Epa-1 system, however, male murine skin cells were
fully resistant to H-2-restricted, HYspecific lysis (10). This finding was even more
puzzling because male epidermal cells were quite capable ofpriming syngeneic fe-
male lymphocytes in vivo for the subsequent generation ofH-Y-specific CTLs. How-
ever, this apparent paradox stands not on itselfsince the failure to lyse murine epidermal
cells with CTL was also found in other non H-2 antigenic systems (Steinmuller,
D., personal communication). It remains unclear, however, why murine but not human
keratinocytes would be refractory to HYspecific lysis. It might be possible that using
keratinocytes in cell suspension induces resistance to cellular killing. In fact, refrac-
toriness ofnonadherent keratinocytes to lysis through conventional anti HLA CTL
has been described in man also (18). Since our results to not agree with this latter
finding our reasoning is that technical aspects such as clonal affinity and target cell
circumstances are of major importance for the detection of HLA and or non-HLA
antigens on nonconventional target cells (de Bueger, M. M., et al., submitted for
publication).
Although we normally observed HLA-A2-directed cytolysis ofnon-IFN-y-treated
adherent human keratinocytes, in the majority of cases pretreatment with IFN-y
VAN ELS ET AL. BRIEF DEFINITIVE REPORT 1473
was needed to upregulate H-Y-specific killing to detectable levels. It would be of in-
terest to know whether the resistance to HYspecific CTLs ofmurine male keratino-
cytes (10) could be overcome by pretreatment with IFN-y. If so, the accessibility
ofthe H-Y antigen to CTLs in human and murine skin would not essentially differ.
IFN-y may enhance HY recognition by different mechanisms, such as upregula-
tion of HLA restriction elements or of the H-Y antigen itself, but also other acces-
sory. structures such as ICAM-1 may play a role (19). Whatever mechanism(s) are
involved, we propose that in situ release of IFN-y, eventually produced by local im-
mune T cells, may effectively enhance the CTL recognition of mH antigens in the
human skin after allogeneic bone marrow grafting.
Summary
We studied the expression of the male-specific mH antigen HY on cultured human
skin cells by investigating their susceptibility to H-Y-specific cytolysis using conven-
tional class I-restricted CTL clones in a modified cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay.
In contrast to what was found in the rodent system, we observed H-Y-specific lysis
of human male keratinocytes. Susceptibility for H-Y-specific lysis was efficiently en-
hanced by exposure of the keratinocytes to IFN-y. Our results demonstrate that human
skin cells are equally sensitive for the activity of H-Y-specific CTLs as target cells
of lymphoid origin. Finally, the cellular recognition of the HY mH antigen in the
skin further supports its possible target function in thelocal graft versus host attack.
