The role of cell-specific metabolism in benzene toxicity was examined in both murine and human
bone marrow. Hemopoietic progenitor cells and stromal cells are important control points for
regulation of hemopoiesis. We show that the selective toxicity of hydroquinone at the level of the
macrophage in murine bone marrow stroma may be explained by a high peroxidase/nicotanimide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced [NAD(P)Hl:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) ratio.
Peroxidases metabolize hydroquinone to the reactive 1,4-benzoquinone, whereas NQO1 reduces
the quinones formed, resulting in detoxification. Peroxidase and NQO1 activity in human stromal
cultures vary as a function of time in culture, with peroxidase activity decreasing and NQO1 activity
increasing with time. Peroxidase activity and, more specifically, myeloperoxidase, which had
previously been considered to be expressed at the promyelocyte level, was detected in murine
lineage-negative and human CD34+ progenitor cells. This provides a metabolic mechanism
whereby phenolic metabolites of benzene can be bioactivated in progenitor cells, which are
considered initial target cells for the development of leukemias. Consequences of a high
peroxidase/NQO1 ratio in HL-60 cells were shown to include hydroquinone-induced apoptosis.
Hydroquinone can also inhibit proteases known to play a role in induction of apoptosis, suggesting
that it may be able to inhibit apoptosis induced by other stimuli. Modulation of apoptosis may lead
to aberrant hemopoiesis and neoplastic progression. This enzyme-directed approach has
identified target cells of the phenolic metabolites of benzene in bone marrow and provided a
metabolic basis for benzene-induced toxicity at the level of the progenitor cell in both murine and
human bone marrow. Environ Health Perspect 104(Suppl 6):1177-1182 (1996)

Introduction
Benzene has been extensively used as a regulation (4). Benzene ranks as the 17th
solvent in industry and was first identified chemical in terms of total annual produc-
as a myelotoxin in 1897 (1). Its leuke- tion in 1994 (5) and therefore represents a
mogenic activity was suggested in 1897 (2) significant occupational hazard. Although
and fully characterized in 1928 (3). The the occupational hazards of benzene are
occupational hazards of benzene have been well characterized, the presence of benzene
the subject of active debate and continuing in cigarette smoke (6) and in gasoline (7)

renders benzene exposure an environ-
mental as well as an occupational problem.
Chronic exposure to benzene results in
progressive deterioration in hemopoietic
function. Anemia, leukopenia, thrombo-
cytopenia, pancytopenia, and aplastic ane-
mia have all been reported after chronic
benzene exposure (8,9). Somewhat para-
doxically, benzene also induces marrow
hyperplasia (9,10). Acute myelogenous
leukemia has been associated most often
with benzene exposure, although other
forms of leukemia have also been reported
(10). It has been noted that leukemia asso-
ciated with benzene exposure frequently
develops following a period ofbone marrow
depression (10,11).
The mechanisms underlying benzene-
induced myelotoxicity and leukemia are
unclear, but there is considerable evidence
that benzene requires metabolic activation
to exert its adverse effects (12). Benzene's
major toxicity is myeloid, but the majority
of benzene metabolism occurs in the liver
(12). Thus, if metabolism is a determinant
of toxicity, either activation of benzene
must occur in the target tissue or metabo-
lites generated in the liver must be trans-
ported to the bone marrow where further
metabolism may play a role in the toxic
process (Figure 1). The major hepatic
metabolites of benzene are phenol, cate-
chol, and hydroquinone (12). Catechol and
hydroquinone have been shown to persist
in bone marrow after benzene exposure
(13). The bone marrow is rich in peroxi-
dase activity (14), and phenolic metabolites
of benzene can be activated by peroxidases
to reactive quinone derivatives (15-18).
Reactive quinones derived from phenolic
metabolites can be detoxified by the
quinone reductase NAD(P)H:quinone oxi-
doreductase (NQOI, DT-diaphorase) (19).

Metabolism ofbenzene is complex, however,
and other metabolites such as benzene
oxide, trans-trans-muconaldehyde, and
1,2,4-benzenetriol have also been proposed
to play a role in benzene toxicity (12,20).
Within the bone marrow, both
hematopoietic progenitor cells and bone
marrow stromal cells are potential targets
of benzene toxicity (10,21,22) (Figure 2).
The progenitor compartment includes
hemopoietic stem cells and the CD34+
compartment contains all clonogenic cells
in human bone marrow, including both
short- and long-term repopulating cells
(23). Progenitor cells are thought to be the
cells of origin for leukemias (24) and are
attractive as potential targets of toxins such
as benzene, whose toxic effects are not
restricted to a single hemopoietic lineage.
The stroma, on the other hand, provides a
supporting framework within the medul-
lary cavity of the bone marrow for the
process of blood cell development (25,26).
Stromal cells are critical in regulation of
normal hemopoiesis (26) and have been
considered as important targets of benzene
toxicity (21,22,27-29). Stromal cells are
intimately associated with developing
blood cells and regulate hemopoiesis via
direct cell-to-cell interactions, the produc-
tion of extracellular matrix components,
and the secretion ofsoluble mediators such
as cytokines and eicosanoids (26,28,30).
Although metabolism is central to ben-
zene toxicity, studies ofthe metabolic capa-
bility of human bone marrow are scarce
and we are not aware ofany studies in crit-
ical cellular subpopulations such as human
stroma and CD34+ cells. In this paper we
examine the enzymology and potential
consequences of cell specific bioactivation
of phenolic metabolites of benzene in both
murine and human bone marrow.

cell line, designated LTF, was obtained
from single-cell clones of long-term bone
marrow cultures and cultured as described
by Thomas et al. (32).

marrow was obtained from healthy
volunteers by aspiration.
For human stroma, the method of
Kojima et al. (34) was used. Mononuclear
cells from bone marrow specimens were
separated on Ficoll/Hypaque and plated at
20 x 106/10 ml of cc-minimal essential
medium (MEM) supplemented with
12.5% horse serum, 12.5% fetal calfserum,
and 10-6 M hydrocortisone in 100x20
mm tissue culture dishes sometimes con-
taining 12-mm round glass cover slips to
facilitate microscopy. Cultures were incu-
bated at 37°C in 5% C02/95% air. Cells
are refed weekly by exchanging half the
medium for fresh medium. Adherent stro-
mal cultures were composed mainly of
fibroblastoid cells with some adipocytes,
macrophages, and endothelial cells.
CD34+ cells were purified using
magnetic bead technology and a Miltenyi
(Miltenyi Biotec, Sunnyvale, CA) CD34+
cell purification kit (QBEND/10, mouse
IgGI). Briefly, cells were labeled with a
modified CD34+ antibody and then puri-
fied using colloidal magnetic beads that
recognize the modified CD34+ antibody.
Cells were purified by two passes through a
magnetized column in the Vario-MACS
system. From a single isolation (50-200
x 106) cell, we obtain 0.5 to 1 x 106 cells of
greater than 96% purity, as assessed by,
flow cytometry (35).
Peroxidase and NQOI Activity
Measurements. In the case of NQO1,
dicoumarol-inhibitable reduction of
dichlorophenolindophenol was followed at
600 nm (36), whereas for peroxidase a
spectrophotometric assay based on the oxi-
dation of tetramethylbenzidine was used
(35). Peroxidase activity was expressed as
absorbance U/4 min/mg protein as described
by Schattenberg et al. (35). Flow cytomet-
ric assays for peroxidase activity were
performed using 2,7-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate (DCFH-DA) as previously
described (35).
Determination ofApoptosis in HL-60
Cells by Fluorescent Microscopy. For
assessment of apoptosis by fluorescent
microscopy, 10 pl of Hoechst 33342 (50
pg/ml) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added
to 0.5 ml of treated cell suspension and
incubated for 10 min at 370C. Cells were
then centrifuged and the supernatant
removed. Propidium iodide was then
added (50 pl 5 pg/ml) and samples kept on
ice until fluorescence microscopy. Hoescht
33342 is a nuclear dye and normal cells
have a blue homogenous nucleus. Apoptotic
cells have condensed and fragmented chro-
matin and frequently show the presence of
apoptotic bodies. Apoptotic cells also show
an elevated fluorescence intensity relative
to control cells (37,38). Cells that appear
pink (i.e., do not exclude propidium
iodide) and do not have condensed chro-
matin are scored as necrotic. For scoring, at
least 200 cells were counted.
Results and Discussion
Stroma is a heterogeneous system contain-
ing different cell types such as fibroblasts,
macrophages, endothelial cells, and
adipocytes. Within murine bone marrow
stroma, the stromal macrophage is selec-
tively sensitive to the toxic effects of the
benzene metabolite hydroquinone (32).
We have shown that this can be explained
on the basis of cell-specific metabolism
within bone marrow stroma (31,39).
Specifically, the bone marrow-derived
macrophage had an increased capability to
activate hydroquinone to the reactive 1,4-
benzoquinone via peroxidatic oxidation
and a decreased ability to detoxify 1,4-ben-
zoquinone via NQO 1 (Figure 3). The con-
cept of the cytotoxicity of phenolics being
influenced by a balance between peroxi-
dase-mediated oxidation and NQO1-
mediated reduction of any reactive
quinones generated was originally devel-
oped by Smart and Zannoni (40). Since
that time, the critical role of both peroxi-
dases and NQO1 in activation and
detoxification respectively in bone marrow
has been supported by many studies
(15-17,41-44). The murine bone mar-
row-derived macrophage also had a
decreased glutathione S-transferase activity
relative to the stromal macrophage and
whole marrow (45). Glutathione content
did not differ between macrophages and
stromal fibroblasts (45), suggesting it did
not play a role in the selective toxicity of
hydroquinone in murine stroma.

In purified murine bone marrow-
derived macrophage cultures, hydroqui-
none reduced detectable interleukin-1
(IL-1) activity, suggesting that hydro-
quinone interfered with macrophage
function by depressing macrophage IL-1
secretion (32). Hydroquinone inhibits
ILla processing from its precursor form
(pre-ILla) to the mature cytokine (ILla) in
murine bone marrow-derived macrophages
and in the P388D1 macrophage monocyte
cell line (46). The protease responsible for
ILaW processing is the enzyme calpain
(47,48) and we have shown that hydro-
quinone decreases calpain activity and con-
tent in bone marrow macrophages (Figure
4). Calpain exists in two isozymic forms-
calpain I and calpain II. The effects of
hydroquinone were specific to calpain II
using immunoblot analysis (49). This

work provides a potential mechanism for
the effects ofhydroquinone on ILla secre-
tion at the level ofthe macrophage in bone
marrow stroma (Figure 4). It also demon-
strates the utility of examining cell-specific
bioactivation in heterogeneous systems and
shows how the data can be used to identify
potential target cells.

by human lymphocytes (51) has been
observed, so metabolism of benzene in situ
in human marrow cannot be discounted.
In preliminary data we have been unable to
detect any metabolism of benzene to phe-
nolics or open-ringed metabolites in
murine bone marrow or in human marrow
mononuclear cells using high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) with con-
ventional UV/visible detection. Clearly,
metabolism studies need to be performed
using much more sensitive methods of
detection such as employing 14C-benzene.
The activity of critical enzymes in
human bone marrow stroma and progeni-
tor populations has not been examined. In
Figure 5 we show preliminary data demon-
strating that the peroxidase and NQO1
activity in human stromal cultures varies as
a function of time in culture. Peroxidase
activity of human stroma decreases with
time in culture whereas the NQO1 activity
increases. Since freshly aspirated human
marrow has high peroxidase and low
NQO1 activity, this suggests that the
metabolic phenotype of mature stoma may
be unrepresentative of human bone mar-
row and influenced by culture conditions
or cell differentiation. Clearly, whether
human stromal cultures, which are used for
toxicological studies, actually bear any
resemblance in a metabolic sense to cells in
marrow is an important question. An alter-
native explanation for this observation is
that stromal microenvironments exist
in situ in bone marrow with low peroxidase
and high NQO1 activity that are not
removed by aspiration.

hematopoietic target cell populations is
unclear. Peroxidase, and specifically myelo-
peroxidase (MPO), has been considered to
be expressed at the level of the promyelo-
cyte (14). The promyelocyte is at a much
later stage of differentiation than myeloid
progenitor cells, which are considered the
target cells for neoplastic transformation in
leukemogenesis. Using both biochemical
and flow cytometric measurements of per-
oxidase activity (Figure 6), we showed that
both murine lineage-negative progenitors
and human CD34+ progenitors expressed
marked peroxidase activity (35). MPO
mRNA was also detected in murine prog-
enitors (35). Strobl et al. have also subdi-
vided the MPO-positive phenotype further
using the CD33+ marker (52). These
authors showed that CD34+, CD33high
cells contained MPO, but that the more
primitive CD34+ CD33low cells did not.
Some potential consequences of an
elevated MPO/NQO1 ratio are shown in
Figure 7. Cells with this metabolic pheno-
type are potential targets of phenolic
metabolites of benzene as a result of bio-
activation and subsequent covalent bind-
ing, altered production of regulators of
hemopoiesis, or apoptosis. It is difficult to

overestimate the role of imbalanced apop-
tosis in hemopoietic disease. Hemopoietic
cells are likely to undergo apoptosis as a
result of growth factor deprivation, tox-
ins, or as an integral part of hemopoiesis
(53-56). Inappropriate apoptosis of prog-
enitor cells would be expected to exert a
profound effect on normal hemopoiesis
(55-57). We have found that hydroqui-
none is a potent inducer ofapoptosis in the
human promyelocytic HL-60 cell line
(Figure 8), which has a high MPO/NQO1
ratio. In preliminary experiments we have
also found that hydroquinone can induce
apoptosis in CD 34+ human progenitor
cells (not shown). This is a potentially
important finding that needs to be pursued.
The data suggest that benzene may
induce its hemopoietic toxicity via induc-
tion of apoptosis. Hydroquinone, however,
can also inhibit the ILI-processing enzyme
calpain, which is known to play a central
role in induction of apoptosis (58). This
raises the fascinating possibility that in
addition to directly inducing apoptosis in
critical cells such as progenitor cells, benzene
and its metabolites may inhibit apoptosis
induced by other stimuli via inhibition of
critical proteases in the apoptotic cascade
such as calpain and interleukin 1 P convert-
ing enzyme (ICE). Inhibited apoptosis has
been associated with neoplastic progression
(55,59,60) and may therefore contribute
to benzene leukemogenesis. Myelodysplastic

myeloid leukemia are both characterized by
a high degree of proliferation, but fully
developed leukemias have a much lower
rate of apoptosis than MDS, resulting in a
more proliferative and lethal condition
(57). Inhibition ofapoptosis may therefore
play a role in the progression of MDS to
acute myeloid leukemia (57).
In summary, we have characterized,
using cell-specific metabolic studies, poten-
tial target cells of benzene toxicity in the
bone marrow. We propose a critical role for
the MPO/NQ01 balance in determining
cellular sensitivity to phenolic metabolites
of benzene. These studies have provided a
metabolic basis for the toxic effects of phe-
nolic metabolites of benzene at the level of
the human progenitor or CD34+ popu-
lation, which are considered the initial
target cells for development of leukemia.
Consequences ofa high MPO/NQO1 ratio
include increased covalent binding, altered
production of stromal-derived regulators,
and apoptosis. Our data suggest that mod-
ulation ofapoptosis in target cells may play
an important role in aberrant hemopoiesis
and neoplastic progression.
