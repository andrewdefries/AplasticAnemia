Background
Hypocellularity of bone marrow (BM), not associated with significant dyshematopoiesis,
is often found in patients with isolated thrombocytopenia, but its clinical implications
have not been studied. We prospectively studied the clinical features and natural history
of these patients.
Methods
Adults with isolated thrombocytopenia (platelet counts ＜100×109
/L) in the absence of
dyshematopoiesis, cytogenetic abnormalities, or megakaryocytic hyperplasia and who
had BM hypocellularity (below 30% in patients aged less than 60 years; below 20% in
patients aged 60 years or more) were enrolled at Chungnam National University Hospital
between January 2002 and December 2006. They were monitored regularly for changes
in platelet counts or development of additional cytopenia.
Results
Twenty patients (17 men and 3 women) were enrolled in the study. The median age was
29 years (range, 18-70 years). At initial presentation, the platelet counts ranged from 12
×109
/L to 99×10
9
/L (median, 63×10
9
/L) and were ＞50×10
9
/L in 16 patients (80%). BM
cellularity ranged from 5% to 25% (median, 15%) and was ≤10% in 6 patients (30%).
During the median 48-month follow-up (range, 12-90 months), platelet counts of 3 of
the 20 patients recovered to normal levels (＞150×109
/L) after 12, 56 and 66 months.
Three patients developed pancytopenia after 11, 70 and 90 months. Two patients were
consistent with moderate aplastic anemia, and 1 was confirmed as having refractory cyto-
penia with multilineage dysplasia. In the remainder of the patients, platelet counts re-
mained unchanged.
Conclusion
Isolated thrombocytopenia accompanied by hypocellular marrow encompasses a group
of heterogeneous conditions.

INTRODUCTION
Acquired thrombocytopenia, not accompanied by anemia
and/or leukopenia (defined as isolated thrombocytopenia),
is observed in amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia [1], in-
fections including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in-
fection [2], nutritional deficiencies [3, 4], alcohol ingestion
[5], and primary or secondary immune thrombocytopenia
(ITP) [6]. A presumptive diagnosis of ITP is made when
the history, physical examination, CBC, and examination
of the peripheral blood smears do not suggest other causes
for thrombocytopenia [7-9]. Bone marrow (BM) examination
is not a prerequisite for the diagnosis of ITP in general
but may be informative in patients older than 60 years,
patients with systemic symptoms or abnormal signs, or pa-
tients for whom splenectomy is being considered [6, 7, 9,
10]. Treatment is rarely indicated in ITP patients with platelet
counts above 50×109
/L in the absence of bleeding, trauma,
or surgery [6, 7, 9, 10]. Thus, many patients with isolated

Thrombocytopenia with hypocellular BM 129
thrombocytopenia do not undergo BM examination.
We observed a group of patients with isolated thrombocy-
topenia, who displayed apparent hypocellularity on BM ex-
amination that was not associated with significant dysplasia
or megakaryocytic hyperplasia. An efficient diagnosis was
challenging in these cases, because hypocellular marrow is
not a recognized manifestation of ITP. If these patients had
not undergone BM examination, they would have been con-
sidered as having ITP. A prospective study on healthy in-
dividuals with sustained platelet counts between 100×109
/L
and 150×109
/L (so called borderline thrombocytopenia) re-
vealed that these individuals had 12% probability of develop-
ing autoimmune disorders within 10 years [6]. However,
the clinical features of isolated thrombocytopenia (platelet
counts ＜100×109
/L) accompanied by hypocellular marrow
and its natural history have not been studied.
The current diagnostic criteria and recommendations for
hematologic disorders originate from Western Europe or
North America, where the epidemiology of hematologic dis-
orders is quite different from that of the Oriental countries.
For example, aplastic anemia (the most common hematologic
disorder showing marrow hypocellularity) is not as prevalent
in western countries as it is in the Korean population [9].
The present study was performed to define the clinical fea-
tures and natural history of isolated thrombocytopenia ac-
companied by marrow hypocellularity without apparent
causes in adults.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
1. Patient eligibility
Adult patients aged 18 years or more with isolated throm-
bocytopenia, who had hypocellular BM (below 30% in pa-
tients aged less than 60 years; below 20% in patients aged
60 years or more) were enrolled at Chungnam National
University Hospital between January 2002 and December
2006. Isolated thrombocytopenia was defined as a condition
characterized by platelet counts below 100×109
/L for longer
than 3 months, with normal WBC (more than 4×109
/L) and
normal hemoglobin levels (12 g/dL or more in women; 13
g/dL or more in men). Pseudothrombocytopenia was ex-
cluded by thorough examination of the peripheral blood
smear. Only patients with normal karyotype hypocellularity
and with no significant dyshematopoiesis (less than 10%
in each lineage) or no relative megakaryocytic hyperplasia
(less than 5 megakaryocytes on average under a high power
field) in the BM study were included. BM specimens were
blindly reviewed by 2 independent pathologists. When the
cellularities were not concordant, the mean of the 2 different
values was accepted as the cellularity. Patients with dis-
cordant decisions on dyshematopoiesis or megakaryocyte hy-
perplasia were excluded. Patients who had viral hepatitis
and those who were positive for anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV)
IgM antibodies, hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen, anti-hep-
atitis C virus (HCV) antibodies, or anti-HIV antibodies were
excluded. Patients with autoimmune disorders were also
excluded. Patients who were positive for anti-platelet anti-
body, platelet-associated antibody, antinuclear antibodies,
lupus anticoagulants, or anti-cardiolipin antibodies and who
displayed low complement (C3 or C4) levels or abnormal
thyroid function tests were excluded, and so were patients
displaying active infections and pregnant women. Patients
with clinical evidence of intravascular hemolysis (reticulocy-
tosis, abnormally high concentration of serum lactate de-
hydrogenase and indirect bilirubin, and abnormally low con-
centration of serum haptoglobin) were excluded. Standard
single-color flow cytometry was performed for screening
of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and patients dis-
playing more than 3% of CD55- or CD59-deficient RBCs
or granulocytes were excluded. In addition to laboratory
investigations for determining eligibility, the serum levels
of erythropoietin (EPO) were measured by radioimmuno-
assay at initial presentation.
2. Follow-up
We followed eligible patients who did not undergo platelet
transfusion or drug therapy. They were regularly monitored
monthly for the first 3 months and then every 3 months
for the remaining period. CBC and reticulocyte counts were
examined at every visit. Routine chemistry, urine analysis,
and studies to rule out systemic lupus erythematosus and
primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome were per-
formed once a year. When the platelet counts decreased
further or when pancytopenia developed, BM examination
was performed along with conventional cytogenetic studies.
3. Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version
18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Correlation efficiencies among
laboratory parameters were calculated according to Pearson’s
principle, and P-value＜0.05 was deemed statistically signi-
ficant.
RESULTS
1. Patient characteristics
Between January 2002 and December 2006, we studied
224 patients with isolated thrombocytopenia by using techni-
ques including BM examination. Among these patients, 20
(17 men and 3 women) were consistent with isolated throm-
bocytopenia accompanied by hypocellular marrow. The me-
dian age of the patients was 29 years (range, 18-70 years)
(Tables 1, 2). Three young male patients aged less than 20
years (UPN 5, 13, and 15) were referred to our hospital
for thrombocytopenia found incidentally during routine lab-
oratory examination for military recruitment. The remainder
of the group was referred from local clinics for further evalua-
tion of thrombocytopenia found during health examination
or during examination for minor illness. One old male patient
(UPN 19) had episodic easy bruising, but symptoms or signs
commonly associated with thrombocytopenia were not ob-
served in the other patients (data not shown).

Thrombocytopenia was typically mild, with platelet counts
ranging from 12×109
/L to 99×10
9
/L (median, 63×10
9
/L). The
platelet counts were above 50×109
/L in 16 patients (80%)
and between 20×109
/L and 50×10
9
/L in 3 patients (15%).
According to the definition of isolated thrombocytopenia
accompanied by hypocellular marrow, anemia was not pres-
ent in these patients. However, 6 of the 20 patients (30%)
had macrocytic red blood cells (mean corpuscular volume,
MCV＞100 fL). MCV ranged from 83.4 to 111.3 fL (median,
95.8 fL) (Tables 1, 2). Serum EPO levels were measured
in 15 patients. Among them, 12 patients (80%) had serum
EPO levels higher than the upper limit of the reference
range (3.7-31.5 mIU/mL), and 3 patients (20%) displayed
levels greater than 3-times the upper limit. No correlation
was observed between serum EPO levels and platelet counts
(R2
=0.0814, P=0.264). In contrast, a weak positive correlation
was observed between serum EPO levels and MCV (R2
=
0.2806, P=0.051) (Fig. 1).
BM cellularity ranged between 5% and 25% (median, 15%)
and was 10% or lower in 6 patients (30%), 11-20% in 13
patients (65%), and 21-25% in 1 patient (5%). Cellular dis-
tribution was even in 14 patients (70%) and uneven in 6
patients (30%) (Table 2, Fig. 2). There was no correlation
between cellular distribution and platelet counts (data not
shown). A weak positive correlation existed between BM
cellularity and platelet counts (R2
=0.2044, P=0.045).
However, BM cellularity did not correlate with hemoglobin
levels (R2
=0.0016, P=0.869) or serum EPO levels (R
2
=0.0046,
P=0.809) (Fig. 1).
2. Clinical outcomes in long-term follow-up
Twenty patients were followed-up for a median of 48
months (range, 12-90 months). Platelet counts in 3 patients
(UPN 1, 6, and 7) had recovered to normal values (＞150×
109
/L) during 12, 56, and 66 months of follow-up, respec-
tively. Conversely, 3 patients (UPN 2, 11, and 14) developed
pancytopenia at 90, 11, and 70 months of follow-up, respec-

tively. Findings in 2 patients (UPN 2 and 11) were consistent
with normal karyotyped moderate aplastic anemia, and 1
patient (UPN 14) was confirmed as having normal kar-
yotyped refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia
(RCMD). No severe aplastic anemia, leukemia, paroxysmal
nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or autoimmune disorders were
observed. The platelet counts remained unchanged in the
remainder of patients during the follow-up for a median
of 27.5 months (range, 12-77 months) (Tables 1, 3). One
patient with aplastic anemia (UPN 11) was placed on im-
munosuppressive therapy consisting of antithymocyte glob-
ulin and cyclosporine, which resulted in complete response.
The RCMD patient underwent allogeneic hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation and has been healthy with normal
CBC for 3 months after transplantation.

DISCUSSION
Recently, a significant increase has been observed in in-
cidentally discovered thrombocytopenia, most likely because
extensive and regular health examinations are being con-
ducted. Mild to moderate thrombocytopenia is also identified
during routine laboratory examination given to young adults
during military recruitment. If the relevant causes for throm-
bocytopenia are not determined in these patients, ITP is
the most suitable diagnosis. However, thrombocytopenia is
difficult to diagnose, if the BM examination reveals a mark-
edly decreased cellularity without significant dysplasia, sug-
gesting myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or megakaryocytic
hyperplasia, suggesting ITP. In some cases, the relative in-
crease in the number of megakaryocytes, despite decreased
cellularity, is evident. This suggests ITP and a likely response
to corticosteroid treatment. In many cases, however, it is
difficult to determine the presence of dyshematopoiesis or
megakaryocytic hyperplasia because of the paucity of the
cells in BM aspirates and marked hypocellularity in BM
biopsies.
A decrease in BM cellularity is observed in several hemato-
logic disorders, including aplastic anemia, hypoplastic MDS,
and hypoplastic leukemia, and distinguishing one from an-
other is not always easy [11-13]. In the present study, only
patients having definite hypocellular marrow, without evi-
dence of megakaryocytic hyperplasia, were included, thereby
precluding the possibility that some of the patients might
have ITP, because marrow hypocellularity is not a compo-
nent of ITP. Although screening for Helicobacter pylori (H.
pylori) infection is currently recommended in the work-up
of adults with typical ITP [9], we did not perform H. pylori
test in the present study because the benefits of testing were
unproven or controversial during the period of patient enroll-
ment. In future studies, sensitive H. pylori testing will be
required.
A prerequisite for aplastic anemia is pancytopenia or bicy-
topenia, in addition to hypoplastic or aplastic marrow. The
patients included in this study did not meet the criteria
for aplastic anemia. Patients showing significant dyshemato-
poiesis or abnormal localization of immature precursors in
BM examination were also excluded from the present study,
even though dysplasia was difficult to assess in some instances
due to the paucity of cells in the aspirates. Immunostain
for CD34, CD117, or myeloperoxidase on BM biopsy speci-
mens has recently been reported to be helpful in distinguish-
ing hypocellular MDS from aplastic anemia [13-15]. In addi-
tion, high-resolution whole-genome tiling path array com-
parative genomic hybridization analysis of CD34+ cells from
patients with MDS having normal karyotypes can reveal
cryptic copy number alterations [16]. However, it remains
unknown whether these additional laboratory studies are
helpful in further defining isolated thrombocytopenia ac-
companied by hypocellular marrow. Although we did not
Korean J Hematol 2011;46:128-34.
Thrombocytopenia with hypocellular BM 133
perform immunostain or molecular examination, the patients
in the present study did not meet the criteria for MDS as
proposed by the WHO [17]. Because it is sometimes difficult
to diagnose low-risk MDS in patients with mild cytopenia,
a provisional diagnosis of idiopathic cytopenia of undeter-
mined significance (ICUS) has been proposed. ICUS was
diagnosed in 10 patients with mild to marked unexplained
cytopenia without definite signs of a myeloid neoplasm [18].
Since all patients displayed normocellular marrow, the pa-
tients in our study could not be classified as having ICUS.
Some of the patients showed an uneven cellular distribution
in the BM study. The clinical implications of this finding,
however, remain unknown, and further studies are required.
In the present study, 2 of 20 patients showed pancytopenia
consistent with aplastic anemia during follow-up, indicating
a subgroup, in which isolated thrombocytopenia accom-
panied by hypocellular marrow can be a prodrome of aplastic
anemia. These patients tended to display higher levels of
serum EPO and larger MCV at initial presentation, suggesting
that anemia was not apparent, because erythropoiesis had
already been stimulated through a compensatory mechanism.
This notion is further supported by a positive correlation
between serum EPO levels and MCV. Therefore, a closer
follow-up is required in patients who display higher serum
EPO levels and larger MCV. One of the 20 patients displayed
MDS 7 years later, indicating that isolated thrombocytopenia
accompanied by hypocellularity can present as an early mani-
festation of MDS. Conversely, the platelet counts were nor-
malized during follow-up in 3 patients, suggesting that iso-
lated thrombocytopenia accompanied by hypocellularity is
a heterogeneous condition and that a subgroup of this dis-
order represents a temporary BM depression of unknown
cause. These observations suggest that longer follow-up is
required even in patients who do not show any changes
in CBC during short-term follow-up. If the patients in the
present study had not undergone BM examination, they
would have been classified as having ITP. Thus, BM examina-
tion may be necessary even in isolated thrombocytopenia,
at least in the Korean subjects. Taken together, these findings
lead us to propose a provisional diagnosis of isolated thrombo-
cytopenia accompanied by hypocellular marrow for patients
who display platelet counts below 100×109
/L and hypocel-
lularity that is not associated with megakaryocytic hyper-
plasia or significant dysplasia on BM examination.
In conclusion, isolated thrombocytopenia accompanied by
hypocellular marrow encompasses a group of heterogeneous
conditions, and its subgroups represent the early manifes-
tations of aplastic anemia, MDS, or temporary BM depression
of unknown cause. Regular follow-up is therefore mandatory
in patients with this condition, and a large-scale observa-
tional study is warranted. In forthcoming studies, vigilant
laboratory investigations, including immunostaining for
CD34, CD117, or myeloperoxidase of BM biopsy specimens
and molecular studies using BM CD34+ cells, may be re-
quired.
