SYNOPSIS
We describe laboratory-conﬁrmed inﬂuenza A pandem-
ic (H1N1) 2009 in 17 hospitalized recipients of a hematopoi-
etic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (8 allogeneic) and in 15
patients with malignancy treated at 6 Australian tertiary cen-
ters during winter 2009. Ten (31.3%) patients were admit-
ted to intensive care, and 9 of them were HSCT recipients.
All recipients of allogeneic HSCT with infection <100 days
posttransplantation or severe graft-versus-host disease
were admitted to an intensive care unit. In-hospital mortality
rate was 21.9% (7/32). The H275Y neuraminidase muta-
tion, which confers oseltamivir resistance developed in 4 of
7 patients with PCR positive for inﬂuenza after >4 days of
oseltamivir therapy. Three of these 4 patients were critically
ill. Oseltamivir resistance in 4 (13.3%) of 30 patients who
were administered oseltamivir highlights the need for ongo-
ing surveillance of such resistance and further research on
optimal antiviral therapy in the immunocompromised.
Immunocompromised patients are at risk for serious
complications from seasonal inﬂuenza (1). This group
of patients has also been disproportionately represented
among those with severe infections from inﬂuenza A pan-
demic (H1N1) 2009, comprising 3.4%–19.6% of patients
admitted to intensive care units in case series from North
America (2–4).
The protective effect of seasonal inﬂuenza vaccination
is reduced in patients with hematologic malignancy and
recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell trans-
plant (HSCT) (5,6). Therefore, these patients are likely to
remain at increased risk for complications from the pan-
demic (H1N1) 2009 virus, despite the availability of an ef-
fective vaccine. Furthermore, the emergence of resistance
to neuraminidase inhibitors may limit the utility of prophy-
laxis in this population (7–12).
During 2009, the predominant strain of inﬂuenza in
Australia was inﬂuenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus
(13,14). In the state of Victoria, after the initial 3 months of
community transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus,
50% of patients who died had an underlying hematologic
malignancy (15). We describe in detail the clinical features,
treatment, and outcomes of immunocompromised patients
hospitalized in 6 tertiary centers in Australia during winter
2009.
Study Design and Population
Six Australian tertiary centers, 5 in Melbourne, Victo-
ria, and 1 in Sydney, New South Wales (NSW), participat-

allogeneic HSCTs for the state. The participating Sydney
center is the largest of 2 centers that perform adult alloge-
neic HSCT for the state of NSW (population 7 million).
Approval for this study was obtained from human research
ethics committees of each center.
Patients were included in the study if they had the fol-
lowing characteristics: 1) >18 years of age hospitalized at
1 of the 5 Melbourne study centers during May 1–August
30, 2009, or hospitalized at the Sydney center during May
1–September 15, 2009; 2) recipient of an HSCT or had an
underlying malignancy (hematologic or solid tumor); and
3) had laboratory-conﬁrmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus
infection identiﬁed by nucleic acid testing (NAT) during
their hospital stay. At each center, investigators were di-
rectly involved in active surveillance and management of
patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009, allowing cases to be
identiﬁed. Data were retrospectively abstracted onto stan-
dardized case record forms.
Inﬂuenza Virus Diagnostics
All cases were conﬁrmed in laboratories whose perfor-
mance is accredited by the National Association of Test-
ing Authorities in Australia. For the Victorian cases, all
but 1 case-patient had laboratory conﬁrmation of pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference
Laboratory (VIDRL) with pandemic (H1N1) 2009–speciﬁc
NAT by using reverse transcriptase–PCR (RT-PCR) as de-
scribed (16). NAT for the other case-patient from Victoria
was performed by the laboratory at the hospital where the
patient was treated. The NSW cases were all conﬁrmed at
the state’s reference laboratory with RT-PCR assays as pre-
viously described (17). Patient specimens had repeat NAT
at the discretion of the treating clinicians. Virus isolates
or clinical samples from patients whose NAT results were
positive after 4 days of oseltamivir therapy were analyzed to
determine the presence of the H275Y neuraminidase (NA)
mutation (N1 numbering) by using either a pyrosequenc-
ing assay (Biotage AB, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, or rolling circle ampliﬁcation
(18). The H275Y mutation confers high-level oseltamivir
resistance and has been detected in all of the oseltamivir-
resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses reported to date,
as well as in local circulating seasonal inﬂuenza A (H1N1)
strains (8,12). Samples also underwent NAT for other re-
spiratory viruses by using a multiplex PCR.
Deﬁnitions and Statistics
Data were stored in Microsoft Access 2003 (Micro-
soft, Redmond, WA, USA), and descriptive statistics were
summarized with proportional outcomes. Nosocomial ac-
quisition was deﬁned as the development of symptoms at-
tributable to pandemic inﬂuenza after 48 hours in the hos-
pital that were not present on admission. Steroid-refractory
or grade III–IV graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) was de-
ﬁned as severe GVHD.
Length of stay was calculated as length of hospital ad-
mission or period of conﬁnement after onset of symptoms
for those with nosocomial acquisition. Epidemic curves for
the 2 states were aligned with epidemic curves of commu-
nity pandemic inﬂuenza activity ascertained from surveil-
lance data (14,19). Daily corticosteroid doses were calcu-
lated by using relative glucocorticoid potency to convert
to prednisolone equivalents, and mean daily values were
determined for patients who received regular intermittent
dosing (20).
Thirty-two patients fulﬁlled the inclusion criteria. Pa-
tient demographics and clinical features are summarized
in Table 1. Seven (21.7%) of the 32 patients died; median
length of stay was 6.5 d (interquartile range 4.0–13.5 d).
Patient Demographics and Baseline Features
Eight patients were recipients of an allogeneic HSCT
(Table 1). Six patients had a human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) matched related, 1 (patient 1) an HLA mismatched
related, and 1 (patient 7) an HLA matched unrelated al-
logeneic HSCT. Patient 6 was the recipient of 2 allogeneic
HSCTs. Three patients (5, 6, and 8) were diagnosed with
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 within 100 days of the allogeneic
HSCT. Six were receiving calcineurin inhibitors. Patient
3 was the only allogeneic HSCT recipient that had docu-
mented recurrence of underlying disease posttransplant.
At the time they sought treatment, all 8 recipients of
autologous HSCT were >2 years posttransplant. These pa-
tients had their malignancy diagnosed between 5 and 8 years
before pandemic (H1N1) 2009, except patient 11, who had
multiple myeloma that had been diagnosed 3 years previ-
ously. All autologous HSCT recipients had a relapse of ma-
lignancy after transplantation, and 7 of these patients were
continuing to receive active treatment for malignancy.
Two patients (26 and 29) who had had recent a diag-
nosis of malignancy were in remission and continuing on
the primary chemotherapy treatment plan. Seven nontrans-
plant recipients had either not shown a response or were
deemed by their treating clinicians to be refractory to their
current treatments. Patient 17 had an inﬂuenza-like illness
(ILI) before admission for chemotherapy and autologous
HSCT (further details below). Sixteen patients (3 alloge-
neic HSCT recipients, 6 autologous HSCT recipients, and
10 nontransplant recipients) were receiving corticosteroids
before the onset of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection. The
mean dose in prednisolone equivalents was 40.9 mg/d
(range 5.0–156 mg/d).
Findings at Initial Visit
Clinical features at patients’ initial visit coincided with
peak activity of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in the Victorian and

NSW communities (Figure; online Technical Appendix,
www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/7/1068-Techapp.pdf). Pa-
tient 17 acquired the infection during interstate travel and
sought treatment in late August, 2 days after return to Mel-
bourne. Four patients had contact with family members
with ILI, and 4 patients had nosocomial acquisition without
an identiﬁable primary or index case (Table 1).
Most patients exhibited fever (94%) and cough (91%).
Dyspnea, sore throat, and rhinorrhea were reported in 53%,
50%, and 50% of patients, respectively. Sixteen patients
(50%) sought treatment within 48 h of symptom onset.
Four patients visited the hospital after experiencing pro-
longed symptoms: for 12 d (patient 4), 14 d (patients 22
and 25), and 21 d (patient 14). Three of these patients had
biphasic illnesses with initial prolonged mild upper respira-
tory tract illnesses and, on examination, had consolidation
shown on chest radiograph. Patient 25 had 2 weeks of dys-
pnea associated with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. Patient 16 sought treatment for shock
and respiratory failure.
Diagnosis of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was conﬁrmed
by NAT of bronchial washings of 3 patients (2, 16, 17).
One of them, patient 17, had symptoms of a viral respira-
tory tract infection for 20 d with negative results for pan-
demic (H1N1) 2009 virus by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal
swab specimens taken 2 and 16 d before bronchoscopy. All

other patients had the diagnosis conﬁrmed on NAT of na-
sopharyngeal swab samples. Six patients (19%) had a base-
line peripheral blood lymphocyte count <200 cells/mL, and
18 (56%) patients had pneumonia shown on baseline chest
radiograph.
Antiviral Therapy
Thirty patients (94%) were administered oseltamivir
therapy. Of these patients, 13 (41%) were administered
therapy within 48 hours, and 16 began therapy >48 hours
after symptom onset. Duration of illness before receiving
oseltamivir was unknown for patient 2. Nine patients re-
ceived NA inhibitors for >5 days. Three of these patients
(1, 12, 18) had a positive NAT result >5 days after oselta-
mivir treatment began. Antimicrobial drug treatment was
changed to zanamir for patients 1 and 8 after they received
initial therapy with oseltamivir (see below). The longest
duration of antiviral therapy was 43 d (patient 1). Patients
15 and 31 had uncomplicated infections and were not ad-
ministered oseltamivir therapy.
Co-pathogens
Four patients had notable co-pathogens identiﬁed. Pa-
tient 2 had 4 concurrent herpesviridae (cytomegalovirus,
Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus 2, and human her-
pesvirus 6) detected by NAT in respiratory specimens and
blood. Treatment for patient 2 included liposomal ampho-
tericin B and foscarnet. Patient 7 had Staphylococcus au-
reus bacteremia from an unrelated source. Patient 17, who
came to transplant with an ILI, had bronchial washings that
were positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 by NAT, galac-
tomannan antigen, and Aspergillus spp. by NAT 5 days af-
ter transplant. Pulmonary nodules consistent with invasive
fungal infection were seen on a high-resolution computed
tomography scan. Patient 13 was infected with respiratory
syncytial virus, which was detected by multiplex NAT on a
nasopharyngeal swab.
Patients Admitted to Intensive Care Unit
Ten (31.3%) patients were admitted to intensive care
(Table 1). In each case, the primary reason for admission to
intensive care was respiratory failure. Seven (70%) of these
patients died, 6 in intensive care and 1 (patient 5) of recur-
rent pneumonia after being discharged from intensive care.
Preterminal events included progressive respiratory failure
(n = 5) and multiorgan failure (n = 2).
All allogeneic HSCT recipients with the following fea-
tures required admission to intensive care for mechanical
ventilation: transplantation within 100 d, severe GVHD,
and nosocomial acquisition of pandemic (H1N1) 2009.
However, onset of symptoms for patient 1 was day 119 af-
ter allogeneic transplantation.
Eight of 10 patients admitted to intensive care had evi-
dence of pneumonia on baseline chest radiograph. Patient

SYNOPSIS
1 initially had normal chest radiograph results, despite the
acute onset of hypoxia. Patient 24 was transferred to inten-
sive care after 3 days in the hospital, at which point bilater-
al inﬁltrates were seen on chest radiograph, and oseltamivir
therapy was begun.
Oseltamivir Resistance
Ten patients had repeat NAT testing to determine clear-
ance of viral shedding. Eight had >1 further positive NAT (2
on sputum, 5 on nasopharyngeal swab specimen, and 1 on
bronchoalveolar lavage sample) after receiving oseltamivir.
Five of these patients had a positive NAT after >5 d of osel-
tamivir therapy. The longest recorded duration of viral shed-
ding during oseltamivir therapy was 28 d (patient 1).
The H275Y NA mutation, a substitution known to
confer a high level of oseltamivir resistance, was detected
in 4 (57%) of 7 patients who had detectable nucleic acid af-
ter >4 d of oseltamivir therapy. These 4 patients comprised
13.3% of the 30 patients who received oseltamivir. The
ﬁndings for the 4 patients who were infected with oselta-
mivir-resistant inﬂuenza virus are summarized in Table 2.
The H275Y mutation was undetectable in initial diagnos-
tic samples from these patients. Additionally, the H275Y
mutation was detected in all available samples collected
from these patients after they received oseltamivir therapy.
Three of the 4 patients who had oseltamivir-resistant pan-
demic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection were HSCT recipients
who had been admitted to intensive care. Virus isolation in
MDCK cells was attempted for the samples that contained
the H275Y mutation but was unsuccessful after 2 passages.
This precluded the use of the phenotypic NA inhibition as-
say to further analyze the samples.
Patient 12, who survived despite shedding oseltami-
vir-resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, had a bipha-
sic clinical course. She initially stabilized while she was
treated with oseltamivir; progressive respiratory failure
then developed, which coincided with her recovery from
neutropenia before later improvement. The other patient
who survived despite shedding oseltamivir-resistant 2009
pandemic (H1N1) virus (patient 20) had an ILI without
pneumonia. Of the 2 patients with resistant isolates who
died, patient 5 ﬁrst experienced the apparent resolution of
pneumonia but later succumbed to recurrent pneumonia,
and patient 1 had persisting pneumonitis despite 36 days of
oseltamivir therapy.
Patient 24 had multiple positive NATs, none with the
H275Y mutant detected. His NAT was positive 4 d after
he began oseltamivir therapy, and he died 1 d after his last
specimen, a nasopharyngeal swab, was collected.
Conclusions
We report a case series of hospitalized cancer patients
with inﬂuenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection
and their outcomes. Patients with hematologic malignan-
cies accounted for 50% of deaths of persons with pandemic
inﬂuenza in Victoria during the ﬁrst 3 months of the pan-
demic (15). The strongest effects of illness from pandemic
inﬂuenza among hospitalized cancer patients in the present
series occurred in HSCT recipients. Nine of the 10 cancer
patients admitted to intensive care were HSCT recipients.
Furthermore, of 7 deaths from pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in
this series of hospitalized cancer patients, 6 occurred in
HSCT recipients (comprising 37.5% of these patients). Our
observations are similar to those seen with seasonal inﬂu-
enza. In a series of hematology patients with respiratory
virus infection, including seasonal inﬂuenza, from 1 large
cancer center, the largest number of infections and deaths
occurred in recipients of allogeneic HSCTs (21). Our ob-
servations support the importance of existing recommen-
dations for control of transmission of inﬂuenza infection in
HSCT recipients during an inﬂuenza pandemic (22).
Half of the 24 cancer patients who had not received an
allogeneic HSCT had underlying multiple myeloma (n = 8)
and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 4). There was also
a paucity of patients with solid tumors (n = 2). The severity
of illness from inﬂuenza in patients who have underlying
multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia has
not previously been widely appreciated, although a high
rate of pneumonic illness from inﬂuenza has previously
been demonstrated at 1 center (21). Patients with multiple
myeloma have impaired cell-mediated immunity, in addi-
tion to humoral immune deﬁcits (6,23,24). All 4 patients
with multiple myeloma admitted to intensive care had pre-
viously received an autologous HSCT, which likely further
compromised immunologic function. They also had been
diagnosed with myeloma for several years.
Bacterial co-pathogens that cause pneumonia were not
identiﬁed in our study cohort. However, patients received
broad-spectrum antibacterial agents on admission. In con-

Oseltamivir Resistance and Pandemic (H1N1) 2009
trast, a small number of investigators have identiﬁed bacte-
rial superinfections in up to 30% of fatal cases of pandemic
inﬂuenza (3,25). For patient 17 in this series, a diagnosis of
pulmonary aspergillosis was made after autologous HSCT,
an association previously reported with seasonal inﬂuenza
in allogeneic HSCT recipients (26).
When there is a circulating strain of inﬂuenza not con-
tained in the recent inﬂuenza vaccine, postexposure oselta-
mivir prophylaxis is an attractive strategy that can prevent
the development of inﬂuenza infection (27–29). Postexpo-
sure prophylaxis of healthcare workers and family members
may reduce the likelihood of exposure through prevention
of inﬂuenza infection in close contacts of HSCT recipients.
Our observations that would support post-exposure osel-
tamivir prophylaxis are 1) 4 of 5 allogeneic HSCT recipi-
ents who died or were admitted to intensive care had either
nosocomial or household acquisition; 2) 5 of 11 HSCT
recipients who had pneumonia before beginning oseltami-
vir therapy died; 3) none of the patients in this study were
known to have received postexposure prophylaxis at the
time of symptom onset, despite use of this strategy during
the study period (29); and 4) 3 patients acquired the infec-
tion in the hospital from unidentiﬁed sources. This nosoco-
mial transmission occurred despite heightened awareness
during this pandemic, which demonstrates the difﬁculties
of effective containment in the hospital setting (28,29).
The ﬁnding of oseltamivir-resistant inﬂuenza virus in
4 of 7 patients with a positive pandemic (H1N1) 2009–spe-
ciﬁc RT-PCR result after >4 d of oseltamivir therapy is a
cause for concern. In Australia, oseltamivir-resistant pan-
demic (H1N1) 2009 has been described in another immu-
nocompromised patient, a renal transplant recipient (30).
No oseltamivir-resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 strains
have been detected in nonhospitalized patients in Australia
(B. Wang and A. Hurt, pers. comm.). The risk of pandem-
ic inﬂuenza developing the H275Y mutation that confers
oseltamivir resistance is considered to be higher in immu-
nocompromised patients (10,12). Immunocompromised
patients have also been overrepresented in deaths associ-
ated with oseltamivir-resistant seasonal inﬂuenza (31,32).
If repeat NAT on respiratory specimens had been routinely
performed for all treated patients in the present series, rates
of oseltamivir resistance may have been even higher than
we observed. Our ﬁndings indicate an urgent need to opti-
mize oseltamivir dosing in immunocompromised patients.
Further research into the role of combination antiviral ther-
apy should be considered (33,34). Immunocompromised
patients should have serial screening for ongoing viral
shedding and oseltamivir resistance. The oseltamivir-resis-
tant H275Y mutants remain susceptible to the alternative
NA inhibitor zanamivir, and therefore the use of this drug
should be considered in patients who are shedding these
viruses (10).
Only 1 of the patients who was in intensive care and
had oseltamivir-resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus sur-
vived. The effects of oseltamivir-resistant inﬂuenza virus
in this patient are uncertain. The deterioration of her con-
dition after initial stabilization may have been related to
development of oseltamivir-resistance and persistent inﬂu-
enza viral replication similar to that seen in a recent case
report (30). Others have shown development of resistance
to oseltamivir within 3 d of therapy (30), and we observed
resistance develop within 4 d for 1 patient. Undoubtedly,
other explanations for her biphasic illness are possible. Im-
mune recovery with resolution of neutropenia may have
enabled viral clearance and recovery.
Universal chemoprophylaxis for HSCT recipients
during an outbreak with an inﬂuenza strain that is not con-
tained in the available inﬂuenza vaccine has been recom-
mended by international guidelines supported by North
American and European Blood and Marrow Transplant
groups, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (22). One
of the study centers instituted universal chemoprophy-
laxis for patients admitted to receive an allogeneic HSCT
after 2 cases of nosocomial-acquired infection before
engraftment (P. Ferguson, pers. comm.). Although the
strategy led to apparent success, with no further nosoco-
mial infections observed, we have concern about this ap-
proach based on 1) the high rate of oseltamivir resistance
(4/30 [13.3%] administered oseltamivir) observed in this
study; 2) overrepresentation of postexposure prophylaxis
in cases of oseltamivir-resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009
inﬂuenza (12); 3) the potential that pandemic (H1N1)
2009 H275Y mutant viruses may transmit and spread
throughout the community, similar to outcomes recently
observed with seasonal inﬂuenza A (H1N1) viruses with
the same H275Y mutation (8,11,35); and 4) the paucity of
hospital-acquired cases seen in this series during height-
ened surveillance and control measures of a pandemic. A
more judicious approach may be surveillance, infection
control measures, and early treatment until vaccination
becomes available (12,22,28). Additionally, education of
patients and their close contacts to facilitate early treat-
ment and avoidance of exposure is essential. When a vac-
cine becomes available, close contacts of those infected,
their family members, and healthcare workers should be
vaccinated.
One of the strengths of this study is the relatively high
coverage of the major hematology centers in a single state,
which reduces the effect of bias on patient ascertainment.
However, patients whose treatment was managed in the
community were excluded, and this information will be es-
sential to our understanding as to which co-factors predict
clinical progression and outcomes for pandemic (H1N1)
2009 infection in immunocompromised patients.

SYNOPSIS
A high rate of oseltamivir resistance developed in criti-
cally ill HSCT recipients, particularly in those who contin-
ued to shed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus after 4 d of os-
eltamivir treatment. Consequently, surveillance, infection
control measures, and early treatment of those at greatest
risk of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection may prove more
useful than universal chemoprophylaxis during an outbreak
with an inﬂuenza strain that is not contained in the available
inﬂuenza vaccine. Continued surveillance for oseltamivir-
resistant inﬂuenza virus strains is needed, particularly in
the immunocompromised.
