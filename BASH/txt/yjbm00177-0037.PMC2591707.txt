OBSERVATIONS RELATED TO PATHOGENESIS OF DENGUE HEMORRHAGIC FEVER.
111. VIROLOGIC STUDIES OF FATAL DISEASE
Virologic study of fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a problem of
special importance to an understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease.
As opposed to experience in patients surviving DHF, virus isolations from
fatal cases are extremely rare, three having so far been reported in the
literature.`2 This report summarizes studies on autopsy materials submitted
to the SEATO Medical Research Virology Department during the period
1962-64.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical materials. Autopsy specimens for virus isolation were collected at the Chil-
dren's, Police, Wachira, Prapinklao, Pramongutklao and Siriraj Hospitals in Bangkok
and Thonburi from April, 1962, through December, 1964. After the patient expired,
the body was usually moved into a refrigerator until autopsy permission. The interval
between death and autopsy was measured in the first 46 study cases and is shown in
Table 1. These cases were all autopsied at the Children's Hospital. Organ sections
were placed in separate containers and transferred to the Virus Laboratory on wet
ice. They were then frozen and stored at -700C.
Venous blood was obtained from some patients with hemorrhagic fever who subse-
quently died. Collection of these specimens has been described.' In other instances
heart blood was drawn immediately after the patient expired, placed at 40C. and
brought to the laboratory. If not already hemolysed, the red cells were separated from
serum. Serum was quick frozen in a dry-ice-alcohol bath and stored at -70°C. until
tested.
Twenty liver specimens were obtained immediately after death by use of Vim-
Silverman needle. These tissues were immediately brought to the laboratory on wet ice.

Autopsy materials were obtained from 27 patients dying of causes other than hemor-
rhagic fever for use in control studies. Final pathologic diagnosis in these cases, with
age and sex of patients shown in parenthesis, are as follows: purulent meningitis
(5mo.F, 1M, 2F, 7M), poliomyelitis (5mo.F, 7mo.M, 4F, 6M), enteritis (8mo.M),
lobar pneumonia (2F), encephalitis (2M,2M,3M,3M,5F,6F,13M), heart failure (1F),
acute bronchitis (3F), diphtheria (3M), aplastic anemia (16F), drug poisoning (1F),
trauma (35M), scleroderma (60F), carcinoma of vulva (29F), carcinoma of gall
bladder (57M), uremia (55M). In 16 cases heart blood was included with autopsy
organs.
Preparation and inoculation of specimens. Each organ was weighed, ground with
purified alundum and diluted 1:10 with 0.75% bovine albumin phosphate buffered
saline (BAPS). Each milliliter contained 500 units of penicillin and kanamycin, and
500 micrograms of streptomycin. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for
10 minutes in Servall SS-34 rotor and the supernatant used for isolation attempts. In
1962 and 1963, serum from heart or venous blood was diluted 1:4 in 0.75%o BAPS. In
1964, dilutions of 1:5, 1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000 were used in a limited number of speci-
mens. Sera in these cases were tested at 1:4, 1:10, 1 :100 and 1:1000. Red blood cells
were washed in 1000 volumes of saline and inoculated into the laboratory host in a
1 :10 suspension.
Virus recovery hosts. One day-old albino Swiss mice were inoculated intracerebrally
and intraperitoneally in doses of 0.01 ml. and 0.02 ml., respectively. Following inocula-
tion, one of two techniques was employed to detect dengue viruses: 1) three blind
passages at 10 day intervals observing mice for sicknesis or death,8 2) challenge of a
portion of inoculated mice at 14 days with 50-100 LD50 of weanling mouse pathogenic
dengue 2 virus.'*
Tissue cultures. BS-C-1, a stable line of African grivet monkey kidney cells, was
used for dengue virus isolation and neutralization tests. Techniques for isolation and
recovery of virus have been described.' Enterovirus recovery attempts were made by
inoculating organ suspensions in primary Macaca irus kidney cells. Preparation of
these cells has been described.8
* The principles of laboratory animal care as promulgated by the National Society
for Medical Research were observed.

Virus identification. Identification of isolated agents was by tissue culture neutraliza-
tion, complement-fixation test of immune serum produced to isolates or plaque reduc-
tion test. Details of these procedures have been described.'
Serology. Hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests were performed by methods de-

RESULTS
Characteristics of population studied
Tables 2-5 describe various characteristics of the population of fatally
ill patients with final clinical or pathological diagnosis of hemorrhagic
fever. The distribution of cases by month shown in Table 2 shows the
seasonal variation and coincides with the period of hemorrhagic fever hos-
pitalization.' The distribution of 169 deaths by day of illness shown in Table
3 resembles data for the day of hospital admission of hemorrhagic fever
patients at Children's Hospital and the Clinical Research Center Study.!
Study of individual cases indicates that death in hemorrhagic fever usually
occurs within 36 hours of admission. This is suggested by the similarity of
day of hospitalization and day of death curves. Age, sex, and ethnic dis-
tribution of cases studied are shown in Tables 4 and 5. These resemble the
distribution of the same groups in total hemorrhagic fever patients as well
as fatal cases reported from Bangkok and Thonburi hospitals in 1962-4.7
In 72 cases from Children's Hospital clinical findings, gross and micro-
scopic autopsy protocols were reviewed by one of us (KV); an additional
68 autopsy protocols by two of us (SBH, SWN). Clinical and autopsy
findings in every case included were compatible with those reported for
dengue hemorrhagic fever.'

virus recovery attempts. Efforts were also made to demonstrate the pres-
ence of viral antigen or of dengue neutralizing substances in autopsy ma-
terials. A dengue 2 strain was isolated from a lymph node suspension from
a two-month old Thai male dying on the fourth day of a febrile disease
characterized by vomiting, diarrhea and a late-appearing maculopapular
rash, and a dengue 2 strain recovered from bone marrow suspension from
a four-year old Thai female with shock syndrome. Serum from this same
patient also contained dengue 2 virus. Table 7 summarizes the methods
employed and the specimens tested. Most of the 1962 and 1963 autopsy
materials were tested in suckling mice by the three blind passage method.
Early in 1964 major viscera and heart bloods from 12 patients at log dilu-
tions (undiluted through 10-3) were inoculated simultaneously into suck-
ling mice and BS-C-1 cells. Three dengue viruses were recovered at a 1:10
dilution of serum in suckling mice, but not from 1 :4 diluted serum; one of
three of these sera yielded a virus from 1:100 dilution on BS-C-1 cell

inoculation. No other viruses were recovered at 1:100 or 1:1000 dilutions
in either host system. As a result of these studies all subsequent virus iso-
lation attempts in tissue culture and suckling mice from serum or plasma
were carried out at a 1 :10 dilution. During the latter half of 1964, specimens
from 43 fatally ill hemorrhagic fever patients were processed in suckling
mice by the dengue 2 challenge technique. Eleven heart bloods from these
patients were processed in BS-C-1 cells with recovery of a dengue type 2
virus from a four-year old Thai female who died within 12 hours of ad-
mission to the CRC Study ward on the second day of illness. This case has
been described elsewhere.9'10
In 1964, 20 liver biopsies obtained immediately after death were tryp-
sinized and inoculated onto BS-C-1 monolayers and into tubes containing
BS-C-1 growth medium. In a few instances viable but sparse growth of
fibroblast-like cells was obtained on primary explant. No cytopathic effect
was noted in primary cultures. BS-C-1 cells inoculated with liver cells did
not resist challenge with a cytopathic virus.
Enterovirus isolation attempts in primary monkey kidney (Macaca irus)
cells were made on specimens from 22 patients. No enteroviruses were re-
covered. However, two agents were isolated in suckling mice that produced
gross and microscopic lesions morphologically identical to those caused by
coxsackie A viruses. These agents were recovered from heart tissue from
a three-year old Thai female dying on the third day of disease and from
the lung of a five-year old Chinese female dying on the fifth day of disease.
Attempt to demonstrate dengue antigen in organs
To determine if inactivated dengue antigen was present in autopsy or-
gans, the liver, heart, lung, kidney, spleen, adrenal, intestine, and brain
suspensions from a four-year old Thai male were diluted 1:10 in saline and
inoculated in 0.01-0.02 ml. amounts intracerebrally and intraperitoneally in
weanling mice three times at weekly intervals. Ten days after the last
inoculation, mice were bled and serum tested for hemagglutination-inhibi-
tion antibodies to dengue 1 and Japanese encephalitis antigens. There was
no detectable HI antibody at a 1 :10 or greater dilution in any mouse serum.
Neutralizing substances in autopsy tissue suspensions
Following these studies, efforts were made to determine whether anti-
dengue substances were present in organ suspensions. Supernatants of or-
gan suspensions, prepared as described for virus isolation attempts, were
diluted to 1:10 or higher in 0.75%o BAPS. To these, serial tenfold dilutions
of prototype dengue viruses types 1-4 were added and the mixtures incu-
bated at 37°C. for one hour. Virus-organ suspensions were then inoculated
in BS-C-1 tubes and tested for presence of interfering agents by the CVR

technique. Table 8 shows that of 11 autopsies so studied, significant anti-
dengue neutralizing substances (LNI>1.7) were found in one or more
organs in seven cases.
Two DHF patients had dengue neutralizing substances in serum, but
not in tissue suspensions; only a few organs were tested in these cases,
however. Some organ suspensions from several of the tested cases neutral-
ized only one dengue virus while serum from the same patient was broadly
reactive. This phenomenon was most extensively documented in case PUO
269. Dengue type 2 viruses were isolated from venous blood obtained on
the second day of illness and from bone marrow obtained at autopsy after
the child had died on her third illness day. Serum obtained at death signifi-
cantly neutralized dengue viruses types 1-4; supernatants of spleen, kidney,
and adrenal suspensions neutralized significant amounts of only dengue 1
virus. In the studied cases, neutralizing activity was found most frequently
in spleen, but often in adrenal, thymus, liver, abdominal lymph nodes and
kidney.
The nature of dengue neutralizing substance was studied in the liver sus-
pension from case TH 406. This suspension, at a 1:50 dilution, neutralized
2.5 logs of dengue type 1, but no significant amount of polio 1, Coxsackie
B 4, Sindbis or dengue type 24 viruses. The same suspension, when in-
cubated for 12 hours at 370C. on BS-C-1 cell sheets, failed to protect these
cells against challenge by approximately 100 TCD50 or InD50 of polio 1,
Coxsackie B 4, Sindbis, dengue 1, or dengue 2 viruses. That neutralization
of dengue viruses was not a general property of human organ homogenates
was evidenced by the failure of many suspensions of various organs to
neutralize dengue viruses and the absence of significant neutralizing activity
in a 1:20 dilution of liver, spleen, kidney, or brain suspensions from a six-
year old Thai female dying of a chronic neurological disease.
Antibody response in fatal hemorrhagic fever
Because of failure to isolate dengue viruses from patients dying of hemor-
rhagic fever, for diagnostic purposes, attempts were made to demonstrate
presence of dengue antibodies in serum in as many cases as possible. Serums
adequate for testing were available for 101 fatal cases. In some of the re-
maining cases, HI antibody content of spleen suspensions were investigated.
A 20%o spleen suspension was made in borate saline, pH9.0. The suspen-
sion was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes in a Servall
centrifuge. The supernate was extracted with kaolin and goose red cell ad-
sorbed precisely as for serum. In the test, initial dilution of spleen suspen-
sions was calculated on the basis of original tissue weight. Serial twofold
dilutions were made, and HI tests conducted in the usual fashion. For 17

patients, spleen suspensions and serum were available allowing comparison
of HI titers. In 15 cases, antibody levels in the two tissues were within two-
fold of each other. Figure 1 shows the HI titers observed in 99 sera and in
spleen suspensions from 26 other fatal hemorrhagic fever cases; all of these
specimens were obtained from children one year old or over.
Because children less than one year old who survive DHF frequently
have a primary dengue antibody response, it was of interest to determine
the type of antibody response found in patients dying of HF in this age
group. As Figure 2 shows, 8 of 20 patients in this group had no detectable
HI antibody at a dilution of 1:20 of serum or spleen suspension. Two pa-
tients had antibody at low levels. Ten patients had antibody at levels sug-
gesting secondary antibody responses. The age of patients with highest
titers is as follows; 5 mo.-1 :1280; 6 mo.-1 :1280; 7 mo.1 :1280 and 1:10,240.
Antibody responses in children 12-24 months old are illustrated in Figure 3.
These resembled the secondary antibody responses seen in children in older
age groups and shown in Figure 1. Antibody titers in fatal hemorrhagic
fever cases over the age of one year were quite different from those ob-
served in a small group of controls (Fig. 4). Extensive HI antibody data
for the normal Bangkok population have been published.87
Data presented elsewhere show that mean HI titers in sera from fatal
hemorrhagic fever cases were lower at every interval after onset of disease
than serum titers in patients who survived DHF.'0 The significance of this
observation is discussed separately.'
DISCUSSION
This paper adds to published reports the recovery of seven dengue viruses
from six patients dying of DHF. Of 169 cases with one or more tissues
tested for virus content, in only two instances were viruses recovered from
tissues other than blood. Despite these isolations, the general experience
was that dengue virus could not be isolated from sera or a wide variety of
organs tested by many different virus isolation techniques. Interpretation
of the failure to isolate dengue viruses, particularly from organs, is difficult
to assess since the site of dengue virus replication in human beings is un-
known. Organs from which dengue has been isolated are: dengue 4 from
liver,' dengue 3 from heart' and dengue 2 from lung' and in our study,
dengue 2 viruses from bone marrow and lymph node. We have also re-
covered dengue viruses from bone marrow suspensions in several DHF
fever patients who survived their disease.'2 Virus recovery rates in these
cases were not higher than from venous blood. The reported isolations of
dengue viruses in organ suspensions do not constitute evidence of virus
replication in those tissues, especially since all viruses isolated were from

different organs. Recovered viruses could have resulted from contamination
of organ by viremic blood or lymph.
It may be argued that the absence of virus at death indicates postmortem
virus destruction. Against this argument are the observations that virus re-
covery rates in blood specimens obtained before death (1/20) and after
death (3/99) were similar. Virus was not recovered from immediate post-
mortem liver biopsies or in autopsies performed soon after death. Further,
in a single case it was not possible to demonstrate development of dengue
antibodies in mice immunized with organ suspensions. Immunofluorescent
studies of human autopsy organs'8 and skin biopsies1' from surviving pa-
tients similarly have been generally negative. Attempts to dissociate virus-
antibody complexes by dilution or dissociation of virus from antibody by
use of fluorocarbons' were unsuccessful. These efforts do not constitute
rigorous exclusion of the presence of either primary or secondary infecting
dengue viruses in tissues of fatal DHF cases. Successful demonstration of
dengue virus in tissue may provide important information concerning the
pathogenetic mechanisms of DHF. This goal should be pursued with more
sophisticated techniques.
The detection of significant amounts of apparently specific dengue neu-
tarlizing substances at 1:20 or higher dilutions of organ suspensions may
explain the low rate of recovery of dengue viruses from various tissues. It
was curious that in several cases monotypic anti-dengue activity was present
in more than one organ suspension while serum neutralized all four virus
types. It may be expected that a considerable dilution of serum is effected
both by tissue itself and during subsequent dilution of preparations in the
laboratory. The antibody detected may, therefore, be the dengue serum
antibody with the highest concentration or highest reactivity. The isolation
of a dengue type 2 virus from one case in which dengue 1 neutralizing
activity was found in organ suspensions suggests the possibility that this
patient had a dengue type 1 infection before her final illness. Her dengue 2
infection may have stimulated the production of high titered dengue 1
antibody as would be expected by the "doctrine of original antigenic sin."
As a second explanation of the observed discrepancy in antibody specificity
in serum and tissue suspension, we suggest that dengue neutralizing anti-
bodies may become associated with and possibly concentrated in tissues
following dengue virus infection and persist in tissue sites for long periods.
As discussed elsewhere' heterologous dengue antibody may mediate cyto-
toxic reactions during secondary dengue infections. If so, it will be im-
portant to determine the antibody immunoglobulin types produced, the fate
and distribution of these following primary and secondary dengue infec-
tions.

The lack of demonstrable etiologic agent in most of these cases should
not be interpreted as weakening the evidence that all or nearly all patients
in this series died during the course of a dengue infection. The clinical ill-
nesses in the reported patients have been reviewed and resemble surviving
documented cases of DHF. Autopsy findings were reviewed and were con-
sistent with the diagnosis. This includes the eight infants less than 12-
months old from whose organs we were unable to recover virus and whose
sera contained no detectable dengue 1 antibody at 1:20 dilution. The sea-
sonal distribution of cases, age, sex, and ethnic distribution, and day of
death all resemble distributions in patients admitted during the same period
who had virologically confirmed DHF. Finally, all but a very small pro-
portion of these patients had dengue HI antibody in serum or spleen sus-
pension. This occurred at titers and a higher frequency than would be
expected in a normal group of the same age and sex composition.
SUMMARY
Tissues from 169 patients dying of hemorrhagic fever in Thailand in
1962-4 were studied for virus recovery or content of dengue virus neutral-
izing substances. That cases studied were dengue hemorrhagic fever is evi-
denced by the following: 1) the day after onset of illness of hospitalization,
month of hospitalization and age, sex, and ethnic group distribution were
similar in fatal cases to those in patients who survived confirmed dengue
hemorrhagic fever, 2) autopsy protocols were reviewed in 140 instances-
all cases were consistent with the reported spectrum of pathologic findings
in Thai hemorrhagic fever and 3) serum or spleen suspensions from 137/
147 fatal cases contained HI antibody to dengue viruses. In 103 isolation
attempts from serum, only four dengue viruses were recovered, three dengue
type 2, one dengue type 1 and one untyped dengue-like virus. Isolation at-
tempts from 523 organs from 98 patients yielded one dengue type 2 virus
from bone marrow and one dengue type 2 virus from lymph node. Efforts
to increase virus recoveries or demonstrate antigen in tissues included
dilution of starting materials, use of suckling mice and tissue culture as
recovery systems, use of explants from fresh postmortem liver biopsies as
a virus recovery system and use of organ suspensions as immunogens and
measurement of development of dengue antibody in mice. These efforts
were uniformly unproductive. A reason for these results may be the pres-
ence of dengue neutralizing substances in suspensions of autopsy organs.
In several instances organ suspensions neutralized only one dengue virus
type while serum from the same patient had broadly heterotypic neutraliz-
ing activity.
