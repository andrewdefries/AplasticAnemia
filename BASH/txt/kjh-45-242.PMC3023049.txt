Background
Cytogenetic abnormalities (CAs) have been reported frequently in patients with otherwise
typical aplastic anemia (AA), but their implications in the prognosis and in the evolution
to hematologic malignancies are controversial.
Methods
We retrospectively analyzed 127 adult AA patients who had successful cytogenetic analy-
sis at initial diagnosis.
Results
The patients were classified into 3 groups according to the initial and follow-up results
of cytogenetic profiles. Group 1 included patients who had persistent AA with normal
cytogenetic profiles (N=117); Group 2, those who had a normal cytogenetic profile at
initial diagnosis but later acquired CA (N=4, 3.1%); and Group 3, those who had CA at
the initial diagnosis, regardless of follow-up cytogenetic status (N=6,4.7%). In Group 2,
2 patients later developed CA without progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); the other 2 patients later progressed to AML. None
of the patients in Group 3 progressed to AML or MDS. There was no significant difference
in overall survival between Groups 1 and 3.
Conclusion
AA patients with CA at initial diagnosis or follow-up may not be at greater risk for evolution
to AML or MDS, or show shorter survival periods. Prospective studies and a larger patient
samples are needed to establish the clinical relevance of CA.

INTRODUCTION
The survival of acquired aplastic anemia (AA) patients has
shown a marked improvement due to immunosuppressive
therapy (IST) and bone marrow transplantation (BMT). This
improved survival creates the opportunity for observing the
long-term course of bone marrow failure syndrome [1, 2].
Technological advances in methods for obtaining complete
chromosomal preparations during metaphase and identifying
cytogenetics (e.g., various banding techniques, fluorescent
in situ hybridization) have allowed cytogenetic studies to
be included in the diagnostic workup and have contributed
prognostic value in several hematological disorders [3].
Cytogenetic abnormalities (CAs) can be observed at initial
diagnosis of AA, may develop spontaneously, or may develop
after years of IST [4-6]. Genomic instability does not appear
to be a rare event in AA, since transient or permanent chro-
mosomal aberrations have been reported with various onset
times. Hence, numerous attempts have been made to de-
termine the clinical implications of CA in AA related to
disease prognosis and to possible evolution into clonal hema-
tologic disorders [7-13]. Some researchers contend that since
AA evolves into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodys-
plastic syndrome (MDS) in approximately 3-13% of all cases
[7], the clonal cytogenetic events in AA over the course
Korean J Hematol 2010;45:242-6.
Aplastic anemia-cytogenetic abnormalities 243
of the disease, as well as at diagnosis, are strongly suggestive
of its preleukemic nature [14-17]. Young patients with hypo-
plastic MDS, especially those with normal cytogenetics, re-
sponded well to IST, which suggests that AA and MDS may
share the same immune pathophysiology for the develop-
ment of pancytopenia [18]. Others insist that the CAs in
AA are associated neither with the natural course nor with
the premalignant characteristics of the disease [8].
　The paucicellularity of the bone marrow makes differential
diagnosis among hypoplastic MDS [19], hypoplastic AML
[20], and AA difficult. Some insist that typical CA, regardless
of bone marrow morphology, could discriminate hypoplastic
MDS from AA [21], but others consider hypoplastic bone
marrow with discrete dysplastic features as hypoplastic MDS
[22]. The discrimination between AA and preleukemia is
important, because they have different natural courses and
warrant different treatment strategies [23]. Therefore, our
aim was to determine the significance of CA in adult acquired
AA by investigating patient survival and progression to other
hematologic diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We retrospectively observed 222 adult patients with ac-
quired AA, who were treated in 4 hospitals located in Busan,
South Korea, between January 1995 and March 2009. Patient
information was obtained by reviewing medical records, ac-
cording to the protocols approved by the Institutional Review
Board (IRB number: 09-10-90). The results of cytogenetic
studies were available for 152 patients.
Chromosomal analysis was performed on 24-48 h syn-
chronized cultures of bone marrow cells. Karyotyping was
done using standard Trypsin-Giemsa banding methods.
Diagnosis and assessment of the disease were based on the
modified Camitta’s criteria. Severe AA required at least 2
of the following criteria: less than 0.5×109
neutrophils/L,
less than 20×109
platelets/L, or less than 1% reticulocytes
(corrected for hematocrit) in the peripheral blood; marked
hypocellularity (less than 25% of normal cellularity) or mod-
erate hypocellularity (25-50% of normal cellularity), with
less than 30% hematopoietic cells remaining in the bone
marrow aspirate [24]. Non-severe AA was defined by hypo-
cellular bone marrow with pancytopenia (without other cri-
teria of severe AA). Morphologically hypoplastic bone mar-
row with dysplastic cells was considered as hypoplastic MDS
and excluded. Clonal CA were defined as 2 or more cells
showing the same chromosomal gain or structural abnormal-
ity, or 3 or more cells with the same chromosomal loss.
At follow-up, the presence of only 1 abnormal cell was
considered sufficient to demonstrate clonal abnormality [25].
A cytogenetic study was considered to have failed, if fewer
than 5 metaphases were seen despite inspection of at least
4 slides. Of the 152 patients with available cytogenetic stud-
ies, 25 patients (15%) were excluded from the analysis be-
cause of a lack of meaningful results (e.g., culture failure
and insufficient number of metaphases).
We grouped patients according to the CA detected at
initial diagnosis or at follow-up and according to progression
to other hematologic disorders. Group 1 included patients
with a normal karyotype at diagnosis and during follow-up,
without evolution into clonal hematologic disorders. Patients
in Group 2 demonstrated a normal cytogenetic profile at
initial diagnosis, but acquired clonal evolution later, and
Group 3 included patients with CA at initial diagnosis, re-
gardless of follow-up cytogenetics.
Means and medians were calculated when appropriate,
continuous variables were compared by the student t-test,
and categorical variables were analyzed by the chi-square
test. The cumulative survival was estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method. The survival rates of patients with
normal and abnormal cytogenetics were compared by the
log-rank test.
RESULTS
We analyzed data from 127 patients on whose samples
successful culture had been performed. The median fol-
low-up period was 46.8 months (range, 0.3-165.8 months).
One hundred and twenty-one patients (95.3%) had normal
karyotypes and 6 (4.7%) showed abnormal karyotypes at
the first chromosomal analysis. Other than sex, there were
no significant differences in baseline characteristics between
the normal and abnormal karyotype groups. The median
age of the latter group was 53 years (range, 25-70), compared
to 47 years (range, 17-83) for those patients with a normal
karyotype. All 6 patients with abnormal karyotypes were
male, and the male to female ratio was 1：1 in the remaining
patients. The ratio of severe AA (SAA) to non-severe AA
(NSAA) for patients with abnormal karyotypes at initial diag-
nosis was 5：1, as compared to 1.4：1 in the remaining
patients. The mean bone marrow cellularity was 13.3% vs.
15.8%, and the number of mean-analyzed cells was 16.4
vs. 18.0 for the normal and abnormal karyotype groups,
respectively.
Patients with abnormal karyotypes at diagnosis showed
no evolution to hematologic disorders; however, of those
with normal cytogenetics at diagnosis, 2 progressed to AML
with clonal evolution (Table 1). The median survival accord-
ing to the severity of AA was 103.3 months in SAA vs.
not yet reached in NSAA (P=0.0014) (Fig. 1).
Among the patients with normal cytogenetics at initial
diagnosis, 117 patients exhibited normal cytogenetics, while
continuing to show AA during follow-up (Group 1). Patients
in Group 1 were treated with IST or BMT in case of SAA.
The 4 patients in Group 2 demonstrated normal cytoge-
netics at initial diagnosis but developed CA during the fol-
low-up period. Of these, 2 did not progress to AML or MDS
at the time of clonal evolution. They showed monosomy
4 and monosomy 7 after 126.0 and 17.7 months of supportive
care, respectively. Both were females (25 and 68 years old)
at diagnosis, respectively. At initial diagnosis, the patient
with monosomy 4 was found to have NSAA, and the patient

with monosomy 7, SAA. They are still alive, having survival
times of 151.0 and 46.2 months, respectively. They do not
require transfusions, nor have they developed any other
hematologic malignancies. The other 2 patients progressed
to AML with structural CA during follow-up assessment.
One of these patients showed complex CA after 2.6 months
of supportive care, and the other patient was characterized
by t(1;11), 51.7 months after IST. They received chemo-
therapy for AML, but both died of sepsis 3 months after
AML diagnosis. The median intervals between the secondary
clonal hematologic disorders and death were 2.6 and 2.9
months, respectively, and their survival time was 5.2 and
54.6 months, respectively.
The 6 patients in Group 3 were diagnosed with AA, and
all demonstrated CA at initial diagnosis. CA was found to
be +8 in 2 cases and +11 in 1 case, -Y in 1 case, t(2;9)/t(1;20)
in 1 case, and t(22;?) in the remaining case. The patient
with +11 received IST and showed a CA of +1 after 23
months. He is still alive and does not require transfusions.
The patient with t(2;9)/t(1;20) and 1 of the patients with
+8 also received IST, but died due to sepsis after 16.4 and
16.8 months, respectively. The patient who had -Y was treat-

ed with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) only,
and the patient died of sepsis after 3.3 months. The remaining
patient with +8 and the patient with t(22;?) received inter-
mittent transfusions and supportive care, and both are still
alive. None of the patients in Group 3 progressed to AML
or MDS (Table 2). Patients in Group 1 did not reach the
median survival time; their mortality rates were 0.19 at 1
year, 0.27 at 2 years, and 0.53 at 5 years. Patients in Group
3 showed a median survival of 16.8 months (P=0.37, com-
pared with Group 1).
Two patients, who were not included in the analysis be-
cause of an unsuccessful culture at initial diagnosis, pro-
gressed to AML or MDS. One of the patients progressed
to AML with +11 after 12.8 months of IST and died of
sepsis 12.2 months after AML diagnosis. The other patient
progressed to MDS with t(1;6) after 28.3 months of oxy-
metholone treatment but died of chronic GVHD 6.3 months
after BMT.
DISCUSSION
Previous studies have estimated CA and genomic in-
stability of AA (at diagnosis or at follow-up) in approximately
4-15% of all cases, but the clinical significance of CA in
AA is still unknown [4-6]. In our study, a review of bone
marrow pathology and of cytogenetics in patients typically
presenting AA by performing peripheral cytopenia and mar-
row pathology showed that the majority of patients had
normal cytogenetics (Group 1), and only 6 patients presented
with clonal CA at initial diagnosis (4.7%) (Group 3). Although
the number of patients analyzed in this study was too small
and the observation period too short to generalize, the clinical
characteristics and the survival data trends demonstrate a
male predominance, an increasing severity, and a tendency
of shorter survival in Group 3 patients than in Group 1
patients.
CAs (e.g., +8, -Y, +11, other structural abnormalities) are
commonly associated with AML or MDS [26, 27]. These
CAs were also observed concurrent with AA diagnosis in
our study. Although only 1 patient in Group 3 underwent
repeated bone marrow examinations, a review of repeated
peripheral blood smear revealed that none of the patients
progressed to other hematologic malignancies. Two patients
in Group 2 later developed numerical CA (monosomy 4
and monosomy 7), but they did not develop AML or MDS.
Although the number of patients in Groups 2 and 3 is too
small to form conclusions, the clonal cytogenetic events in
AA patients does not necessarily imply that AA is a pre-
leukemic syndrome, nor that CA presenting with AA predicts
subsequent AML or MDS development (regardless of IST).
In addition, the full leukemogenic implications of +8 and
−Y are undetermined; however, sole +8 is an insufficient
condition for leukemogenesis [28], and the loss of the Y
chromosome has been observed in the general elderly pop-
ulation, with an incidence similar to that reported for AML
or MDS [29]. The true leukemogenic potential of these chro-
mosomes needs to be investigated. The 2 patients in Group
2, who developed monosomy 7 and monosomy 4 during
follow-up, showed long-term survival in our study. Although
the number of patients is too small and the lack of follow-up
cytogenetics in patients with initial CA makes it difficult
to generalize, the acquisition of monosomal karyotypes in
otherwise typical AA patients may not necessarily mean
a poorer prognosis.
CAs may be adopted by some experts to discriminate be-
tween AA, hypocelluar AML, and hypocellular MDS [30].
Hypocellular bone marrow may obscure the diagnoses of
AA and hypoplastic MDS or AML in cases where cytogenetics
and molecular methods are not available at diagnosis (e.g.,
because of a culture failure). In some cases with pancytopenia,
morphologically diagnosed AA with insufficient cytogenetics
may progress to hematologic malignancies. Therefore, re-
peated follow-up, including bone marrow examination and
cytogenetic analysis, is required to identify misdiagnosed
cases. Moreover, SAA patients whose disease converts to
non-severe AA, or vice versa, and who become independent
of transfusion, need repeated examination of their bone mar-
row for the monitoring of potential evolution to other hema-
tologic malignancies.
CAs are rarely seen in AA. The analysis of 127 AA patients
suggests that, despite the small number of patients with
CA in AA, CA did not affect the survival or evolution into
other hematologic malignancies. As previously reported [8],
adult non-severe AA patients may have CA at initial diagnosis
or at follow-up. More patients and prospective studies are
needed to establish the clinical significance of CA in AA.
