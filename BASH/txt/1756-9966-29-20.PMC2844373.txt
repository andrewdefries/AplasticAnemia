Abstract
Background: To retrospectively review the incidence, treatment efficacy, we followed up newly diagnosed chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients residing in Shanghai during 2001-2006.
Methods: All eligible cases were reviewed with the data of efficacy responses as well as overall survival (OS) and
progression-free survival (PFS) time.
Results: A total of 615 cases entered the study. CML mainly afflicted those aged 40-60 years old and was slightly
more frequent in males than females. More than 85% of the patients were in chronic phase (CP) when diagnosed.
All patients were divided into four groups based on the main regimens - hydroxyurea, interferon alpha (IFN-a),
imatinib, and hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). With the median follow-up of 18 months, imatinib
treatment induced 92.2% complete hematologic responses, and 64.3% complete cytogenetic responses among
CML-CP patients. Overall the therapeutic efficacy in the imatinib group was higher than that in the hydroxyurea or
IFN-a group. Meanwhile, in the imatinib group, all response rates of patients in CP were significantly greater than
that in accelerated or blastic crisis phase. The patients treated with imatinib also showed the most promising
results regarding OS and PFS. Patients receiving HSCT decreased markedly in number with the introduction of
imatinib.
Conclusions: The number of new patients arising in Shanghai increased from 2001 to 2006. There were still
patients receiving hydroxyurea and IFN-a. As the first-line regime for CML, imatinib was less administered in
Shanghai before, but has received considerable development and great responses since 2003.
Introduction
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproli-
ferative disorder associated with chromosomal transloca-
tion between chromosomes 9 and 22, which forms a
fusion gene of BCR-ABL encoding BCR-ABL fusion pro-
tein. The excessive tyrosine kinase activity of this fusion
protein activates multiple signal transduction pathways,
which leads to malignant transformation [1,2].
Previous therapies for CML consisted of hemopoietic
stem cells transplantation (HSCT), interferon alpha
(IFN-a)-based treatment, and simple cell reduction
treatment with hydroxyurea (HU). Diagnostic and thera-
peutic strategies for CML have progressed rapidly since
the first clinical trial of targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
imatinib mesylate (STI571, Glivec or Gleevec; Novartis
Pharma) was conducted in CML patients in 1998. Cur-
rently, imatinib is considered as the first line treatment
regimen for CML [3]. Recently, two additional novel
kinase inhibitors, dasatinib (BMS354825; Sprycel; Bris-
tol-Myers Squibb) [4] and nilotinib (AMN107, nilotinib;
Novartis Pharma) [5], have become available as treat-
ment options for patients who have developed resistance
or those who have shown intolerance to imatinib.
We retrospectively reviewed 615 primary CML
patients administered in Shanghai from 2001 to 2006 in
order to evaluate diagnostic and treatment selection cri-
teria and treatment outcomes for CML.
Materials and methods
This was a retrospective review of local patients initially
diagnosed with any stage of CML during the period Jan-
uary 1, 2001 to December 31, 2006. All patients whose

records were reviewed were registered with the Shanghai
Municipal Center for Disease Control, and validated by
one of the 21 hospitals in Shanghai participating in the
study. The diagnosis was confirmed by bone marrow
biopsy, chromosomal and fusion gene examination.
Medical records for all patients were reviewed retro-
spectively with the follow-up ending on December 31st
,
2007. Demographic data, symptoms, diagnosis, treat-
ment, and prognosis data were collected from clinic
data, written correspondence, and personal interviews.
Hematological response was defined as complete
hematological response (CHR) consisting of white blood
cell count <10 × 109
/L, platelet count <450 × 109
/L,
with no immature granulocytes visible in peripheral
blood, peripheral blood basophilic granulocyte <5%, and
no extramedullary infiltration. Cytogenetic response was
determined by the percentage of cells in metaphase that
were positive for the Ph chromosome in bone marrow.
Cytogenetic responses, based on analysis of 20 cells in
metaphase, were categorized as complete (CCyR, no
cells positive for the Ph chromosome) or partial (1 to 35
percent of cells positive for the Ph chromosome). Major
cytogenetic response (MCyR) was defined as the com-
bined rate of PCyR + CCyR.
Overall survival time (OS) was calculated from the
date of diagnosis to the date of death or last follow-up.
Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured from the
acquisition of remission to the date of progression or
last follow-up. Progression included the progression of
CML from chronic phase (CP) into accelerated phase
(AP) or blastic crisis (BC), or loss of CHR, MCyR, and
CMoR. All safety evaluations were based on National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [6].
Statistical Analysis
Inter-group medians were compared with rank sum test
and inter-group ratios with chi-square test and Fisher’s
exact test. The survival analysis was performed with
Kaplan-Meier curve, and the survival rate and covari-
ables were analyzed with Log-Rank test. All statistical
analysis was assisted with SAS 9.0 (Cary, NC).
Results
Characteristics of the Patients Enrolled
A total of 615 patients were enrolled between January
1st
, 2001 and December 31st
, 2006. There were 325
males (52.8%) and 290 females (47.2%) with the median
age of 49.5 (14-88) years old and a median follow-up
time of 41 (1-78) months.
The number of patients identified generally increased
annually (2001, 72 patients; 2002, 68 patients; 2003, 99
patients; 2004, 113 patients; 2005, 123 patients; and
2006, 140 patients). The age distribution of CML
patients was listed in Figure 1. The patients presented a
wide range of ages; however, high incidence was
observed in the age of 40-50 and 50-60 years old which
accounted for 24.7% (n = 152) and 22.4% (n = 138)
patients, respectively. The majority of patients (86.5%;
n = 532) were in the chronic phase (CP) at initial diag-
nosis. There were 37 patients who presented in the
accelerated phase (AP) (6.0%) and 46 patients in the
blastic crisis (7.5%).
Related Factors of CML Incidence
Past medical history was significant for radiation expo-
sure in four patients, among whom one was a radiolo-
gist. Three patients received radiotherapy because of
other solid tumors with intervals of 6, 38, and 61
months between the radiotherapy and the onset of
CML, respectively. Exposure to chemicals (paint, gaso-
line, and plastic) was documented in 21 patients, among
whom ten were related to the working environment; five
had new apartments decorated within one year before
diagnosis, and six received regular chemotherapy due to
other solid tumors. Family history of hematologic disor-
ders was identified in eight patients, including four
patients of lymphoma, two patients of acute leukemia,
one patient of multiple myeloma, and one patient of
aplastic anemia.
Therapeutic Regimes
In this study, 69 patients could not be followed due to
various reasons, such as lose of contact or lack of clini-
cal data. Data from the remaining 546 patients was
included in the statistical evaluation.
The CML patients in Shanghai received the treatment
of HU, IFN-a with/without Ara-C, imatinib, HSCT, che-
motherapy, and traditional Chinese medicine. HU was
still routinely used for treating almost all phases
of CML, especially in patients in CP (94.1%; n = 514).

Population.

IFN-a with/without Ara-C was also widely used in
almost 74.2% (n = 405) of the patients. Imatinib, which
has been the first line treatment for CML, was used in
less than half of the patients in Shanghai because of its
high cost (41.9%; n = 229). Both chemotherapy (23.6%;
n = 129) and traditional Chinese medicine (18.7%;
n = 102) were adjuvant therapies and were administered
in combination. Chemotherapy was usually employed in
two phases, the hypercellular phase and the disease pro-
gression phase, based on the type of BC (acute non-
lymoblastic or acute lymphoblastic leukemia). The most
common chemotherapy used were homoharringtonine
(HHT), mitoxantrone (MTN), daunorubicin (DNR), ara-
binosylcytosine (Ara-C), and arsenic trioxide (As2O3).
Among the 28 patients who underwent HSCT, 25
received allogeneic related transplantation. The oldest
patient receiving transplantation was 57 years old, and
the median time prior to transplantation was 7.5 (2-36)
months.
Comparison of Efficacy
Four major treatment regimes, including HU, IFN-a
with/without Ara-C, imatinib, and HSCT, were evalu-
ated in this study. The base-line characteristics of the
patients were listed in Table 1. It shows that the efficacy
of current treatment regimens is still unsatisfactory for
both AP and BC patients. Thus, treatment efficacy was
evaluated in CML-CP patients only (Table 2). On the
basis of the median follow-up of 18 months, CHR,
MCyR, and CCyR were achieved in 92.2%, 75.3%, and
64.3% of CML-CP patients, respectively, in the imatinib
group. Rates of all measures of efficacy were substan-
tially higher than those observed in patients who
received either HU or IFN-a with/without Ara-C
(P < 0.0001). However, no significant difference was
found between the imatinib and HSCT groups. The
median interval to CHR was 1.5 months in the imatinib
group, 3 months in the IFN-a group, and 5 months in
the HU group. The median time to CCyR was 9 months
in the imatinib group, whereas it was 24 months in the
IFN-a group. No cytogenetic response could be
achieved in the HU group.
Comparison of overall survival (OS) and progression-free
survival (PFS)
OS and PFS for the major regimens (IFN-a, imatinib and
HSCT) were compared in CP patients, and the results
showed that both OS and PFS were significantly higher in
the imatinib group compared to the IFN-a and HSCT

groups (Figure 2). Estimated three-year and five-year OS
rates were 88.2 ± 2.9% and 85.1 ± 3.2%, respectively,
in patients who received imatinib; 74.7 ± 9.9% and 62.3 ±
14.1%, respectively, in the HSCT group; 83.8 ± 3.1% and
51.2 ± 3.4%, respectively, in the IFN-a group (P = 0.0075).
Estimated three-year and five-year PFS rates were 79.1 ±
2.6% and 73.6 ± 3.8%, respectively, in patients who
received imatinib; 61.1 ± 10.8% and 50.9 ± 12.9%, respec-
tively, in the HSCT group; 60.1 ± 4.1% and 40.2 ± 4.9%,
respectively, in the IFN-a group (P = 0.0021).
Imatinib Treatment
Among the total 229 patients treated with imatinib, 12
received the regimen for less than three months: five
patients due to economic issues, five due to transplanta-
tion, and two due to adverse events. Among the total
217 evaluable patients, 114 received imatinib treatment
as primary therapy and 103 had failed previous IFN-a
treatment. The median time from diagnosis to imatinib
treatment was 28 (4-65) months in the IFN-a failure
group. Treatment efficacy (Table 3), OS and PFS (Figure
3) of imatinib were evaluated based on the stage of the
disease. With the median treatment time of 18 months
(range 4-61), the rates of CHR, MCyR, and CCyR were
significantly higher in CP patients than those in AP and
BC patients. Imatinib treatment as primary therapy was
more efficient than those in patients who had failed
IFN-a. Estimated three-year OS rate and PFS rate were
92.2 ± 3.4% and 85.8 ± 4.3%, respectively, in patients
with CML-CP who received imatinib as primary therapy;
81.3 ± 5.4% and 68.7 ± 6.3%, respectively, in CML-CP
patients who had failed IFN-a; 46.8 ± 13.0% and 39.8 ±
13.2%, respectively, in AP patients and 19.6 ± 7.4% and
10.1 ± 6.5%, respectively, in BC patients (P < 0.0001 and
P < 0.0001, respectively, for OS and PFS).
Adverse Events
The primary side effects reported with IFN-a (+Ara-C)
included fever and myalgia. A total of 25 patients
(12.3%) withdrew due to grade 3 to 4 side effect. How-
ever, only two patients discontinued imatinib treatment
due to intolerance (depression of bone marrow and
edema), both of whom were AP and BC patients. The
most common non-hematologic adverse events reported
with imatinib were moderate (grade 1 or 2) nausea
and vomiting (58.3%), edema (68.9%), myalgia (30%),
and rash (8.2%). Grade 3/4 hematologic depression of
bone marrow was reported in 17.8% of the patients.
Discussion
The treatment of CML has undergone dramatic progress
in recent years. Primary CML patients residing in Shang-
hai were reviewed retrospectively from 2001 to 2006,

with the aim to improve the diagnosis and treatment for
CML in Shanghai and to benefit the large number of
patients afflicted. The number of new patients arising in
Shanghai increased from 2001 to 2006. The demographic
profile of CML patients in our population was similar to
that described in other studies; CML mainly afflicted
those 40-60 years old (47.1%), while fewer patients whose
age more than 60 were affected. CML occurred slightly
more in males than in females. More than 85% patients
were in chronic phase of CML at diagnosis, with <15% in
either AP or BC.
The etiology of CML has yet to be elucidated. Related
factors were preliminarily investigated in the study; how-
ever, further investigation is needed due to lack of con-
trol data from the normal population.
HU and IFN-a were still commonly administered in
Shanghai (especially to the elderly) because of financial
reasons. In the population studied, 78 cases were on HU
monotherapy, and 62.9% of CP patients achieved hema-
tological response, but none of them showed cytogenetic
response. IFN-a achieved lower cytogenetic response
rate, probably associated with nonstandardized medica-
tion in some patients due to side effects and poor compli-
ance. Meanwhile, chromosomes were not re-examined
for about 1/4 of the patients during the period, which
made it unavailable to evaluate the actual efficacy.
Imatinib was administered in a limited number of
patients in Shanghai before 2003 (four in 2001 and seven
in 2002) due to the high costs. With a better understand-
ing of the regimen by both hematologists and patients,
especially after the promotion offered by Glivec Interna-
tional Patient Assistance Program (GIPAP), the number
of CML patients receiving imatinib increased dramati-
cally from 26 patients (26.3%) in 2003, 41 (36.3%) in
2004, and 66 (53.7%) in 2005 to 85 (60.7%) in 2006. All
measures of efficacy were significantly greater in patients
who received imatinib as therapy for CML-CP, with
successively decreasing rates of efficacy observed in those
of AP and BC. Furthermore, primary therapy was more
efficient than those in patients who had failed IFN-a. It
may due to the longer time from initial diagnosis in the
IFN-a failure group, which was about 26 months (3-56
months). Data from the International Randomized Study
of Interferon alpha + Ara-C vs. STI571 in Chronic Mye-
loid Leukemia (IRIS) reported that the efficacy (MCyR
and CCyR) of imatinib would improve further with the
extension of treatment [7,8]. Imatinib also showed the
most promising results in CML-CP patients with regard
to OS and PFS, especially in primary patients.
Resistance to imatinib has been attributed to amplifi-
cation and over-expression of the BCR-ABL gene, point
mutation of the BCR-ABL gene, increased expression of
other tyrosine kinases, or stem cells resistance to drugs
[9-11]. Patients with resistance should be offered trans-
plantations or new drug trials. In this study, only five
were able to receive transplantations due to the lack of
donors. Four patients had entered into the clinical trial
of AMN107 (nilotinib) by the end of 2007. However,
the majority of patients remained on imatinib in combi-
nation with chemotherapy or IFN-a due to the limited
opportunities to participate in the clinical trials of new
drugs in Shanghai.
Due to both limited cases and short follow-up period,
the data of HSTC group was incomplete. The number
of patients who received HSCT has decreased markedly
with the introduction of imatinib into clinical practice
since 2003. The long-term efficacy and prognosis would
be evaluated with the expansion of sample size.
