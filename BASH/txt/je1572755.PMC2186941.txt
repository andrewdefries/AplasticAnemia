A systemic graft-vs.-host reaction (GVHR) 1 induced in nonirradiated recipients can
give rise to a variety of pathological symptoms. One of the possible outcomes is acute
GVH disease (GVHD). After an initial brief phase of lymphoid stimulation (1-3),
acute GVHD rapidly produces suppressive pathological symptoms, such as pancyto-
penia accompanied by aplastic anemia and hypogammaglobulinemia (1-5). A differ-
ent possible consequence of the GVHR is stimulatory GVHD, also referred to as
chronic GVHD. The symptoms of chronic GVHD include a persistent lymphoid
hyperplasia (1-4, 6), hypergammaglobulinemia (2-4, 7, 8), and the formation of
autoantibodies and pathological lesions reminiscent of systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE) and other types of vascular collagen disease (2, 3, 6, 8, 9).2'3
Both types of GVHD can be experimentally induced in nonirradiated F1 hybrid
recipients by the injection of lymphocytes from one of the parental strains. A common
requirement for the induction of both acute and chronic GVHD is the presence of T
lymphocytes in the donor-cell inoculum (3-5, 8, 9).2,3 Which type of GVHD will
develop after the injection of parental T cells appears to depend on the functional
subset of donor T cells activated in the F1 host. Work from this laboratory has shown
that the stimulatory type of GVHD can be induced by alloreactive donor T helper
(TH) cells (2-5, 8, 9) carrying the Lyt-1 +2- phenotype, 3 whereas the induction of acute
GVHD requires both alloreactive TH and T suppressor (Ts) cells (2-5). 3 In the
development of acute GVHD, there appears to be a sequential activation of these two
subsets of donor T cells: first, alloreactive TH cells induce the brief initial phase of

stimulatory symptoms (week 1) and, then (week 2) help to activate the alloreactive Ts
cells (2, 3). The alloreactive donor Ts cells appear to be the final effector cells causing
the rapidly developing suppressive symptoms of acute GVHD (2-5).
Apart from the requirement of donor T cells, another common denominator for the
induction of both types of GVHD is that an H-2 incompatibility between donor and
nonirradiated F1 host is required (3, 5).z Several groups have studied the intra-H-2
differences required for the induction of GVHR (10-15). These studies were limited,
however, to the use of the popliteal lymph node weight assay (15) and the spleen
weight assay (11-14), which were performed at a single point in time, and to the
mortality assay (12-15). The results obtained show that a strong spleen weight
increase as well as a strong popliteal lymph node weight increase is induced across an
I region difference and that only a weak or moderate increase is induced across K or
D region incompatibilities (10, 14). Using irradiated F1 mice as recipients, the
mortality rate was found to be maximal across a total H-2 difference (15). Moderate
mortality rates were found when donor and host differed at either K, I, or D alone
(15).
From studies on the primary antibody response in vitro, on the other hand, it is
known that class II (I-A/I-E) alloantigens preferentially trigger alloreactive TH cells,
which cause the positive allogeneic effect (16),4 and that class-I (K/D) alloantigens
preferentially trigger alloreactive Ts cells, causing the negative allogeneic effect (16).4
In the present investigation, using GVH assays that are able to measure both allohelp
and allosuppression, we studied whether the functional dichotomy between class I
and class II alloantigens exists also in vivo. We asked whether well-defined differences
in class I and/or class II alloantigens can selectively activate, out of a pool of
unselected donor cells, the subpopulation(s) of T cells that cause either stimulatory or
suppressive GVHD. The strains of mice used for this study were C57BL/6 (B6), the
B6 mutant strain B6.C-H-2 bma (bml), which carries a mutation at the K locus (17),
and the B6 mutant strain B6.C-H-2 bmx2 (bml2), which carries a mutation at the I-A
locus of H-2 (18). The results show that, indeed, the dichotomy observed in vitro (16)4
also exists in vivo. An exclusively stimulatory GVHD was induced across a difference
at I-A alone, whereas the induction of suppressive GVHD required a difference at
both I-A and K. By contrast, the K locus difference alone was insufficient for
triggering clear-cut symptoms of either stimulatory or suppressive GVHD.
Materials and Methods
Mice. B6 mice were purchased from Olac 1976 Ltd. (Bicester, Oxon, England). The H-2Kb
mutant strain bm 1 (17) was originally obtained from Dr. D. W. Bailey (The Jackson Laboratory,
Bar Harbor, ME). The H-2 LAb mutant strain bml2 (18) was originally obtained from Dr. R.
W. Melvold (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). Both strains were maintained at our
laboratory by sibling-to-sibling matings. The F1 hybrid mice (B6 × bml), (B6 × bml2), and
(bm 1 × bm 12) were bred in our animal facilities. Sex-matched donor and recipient mice, 8-12
wk old, were used.
PreparationofDonor Cells. Single-cell suspensions of spleen and lymph node cells of B6 donors
were prepared as described (5).
Induction of GVHR. In experiment I, (B6 X bml)F1, (B6 × bml2)F1, and (bml × bml2)Fx
hybrid mice received a total of 108 viable B6 cells consisting of one-third lymph node cells and

two-thirds spleen cells; these cells were administered intravenously in two equal dosages on
days 0 and 7. In experiment II, the three kinds of F1 hybrid mice received a single intravenous
injection of 108 viable B6 spleen cells. Age- and sex-matched noninjected F1 (N F1) mice of the
three strains were used as controls.
ProteinA Plaque-formingCell Assay. To determine the total number of Ig-secretingcells in the
spleens of N F1 mice and in the spleens of F1 mice undergoing a GVHR (GVH F1), a
modification of the protein-A plaque assay was performed as described (19).
Prima~y In Vitro Anti-sheep E~ythrocyte (SRBC) Response. On day 0, a constant number of 5
× 106 spleen cells obtained from N F1 animals were co-cultured with SRBC and increasing
numbers of spleen cells derived from GVH F1 mice (2, 20). Cultures were performed in Falcon
multi-well tissue-culture plates (3008; Falcon Labware, Oxnard, CA) containing 500 /xl of
culture medium. The latter consisted of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 IU/ml), and 2-mercaptoeth-
anol (2 × 10-5 M).
Clinical Signs of GVHR. Twice a week, the GVH F1 were inspected for symptoms of acute
GVHD, such as weight loss, diarrhea, and ruffled fur. The number of dead mice was recorded.
Anemia was determined by biweekly measurement of hematoerit. At weekly intervals, the
GVH F1 mice were tested for elevated proteinuria (->300 mg protein per 100 ml urine) by
means of Albustix test sticks (2872; Miles Laboratories, Ames Div., Elkhart, IN). Previously it
has been shown (21)2 that elevated proteinuria is a reliable indicator of immune-complex
glomerulonephritis (ICGN) in GVH F~ mice.
Detection of Autoantibodies. IgG autoantibodies to erythrocytes were detected by a direct
Coombs' test using a 1:100 diluted, heat-inactivated rabbit-anti-mouseIgG serum, as described
(8). Serum autoantibodiesto thymocytes were detected by a complement-dependentcytotoxicity
test (8), in which ~lCr-labeled thymocytes from normal B6 mice were used as target cells. Mice
were scored positive for autoantibodies against thymocytes when a 1:5 dilution of their serum
lysed _>40%of the target cells. Serum IgG antibodies against nuclear antigens were detected by
an indirect immunofluorescencetechnique, applying fluorescein-labeledrabbit-anti-mouseIgG
serum; cryostat sections of mouse liver were used as antigenic substrate, as described (8). Serum
IgG autoantibodies against double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were determined by an indirect
immunofluorescence technique applying a fluorescein-labeled goat-anti-mouse IgG (Meloy
Laboratories Inc., Springfield, VA); the extranuclear dsDNA of the hemoflagellate Crithidia
luciliae was used as antigenic substrate, as described (8, 22). For the determination of both
antinuclear and anti-dsDNA antibodies, the initial serum dilution was 1:10; the highest serum
dilution at which specific immunofluorescencewas seen was called the titer.
Determination ofICGN. At autopsy, one kidney of each GVH Fa hybrid was snap-frozen and
stored in liquid nitrogen. Cryosections, 4/tm thick, were prepared and incubated for 30 min
with a 1:60 dilution of rabbit-anti-mouseIgG labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (KM 16-
1l-F3; Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service). After a
wash with phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, the sections were mounted with glycerol,
diluted 1:2 phosphate-buffered saline, and examined in a Leitz Orthoplan microscope.
Statistical Significance. Student's t test was applied.

characteristic symptoms of acute GVHD, including a reduced body weight and
reduced hematocrit values (Table I), and died (Fig. 1). In marked contrast, none of

time period between the induction of GVHR and death due to acute GVHD, none
of the (bml ×bm 12)F1 recipients produced detectable amounts of autoantibodies or
had elevated proteinuria (Table II). Thus, the B6 donor cells were incapable of
inducing any symptoms of SLE-like GVHD in recipients differing at both I-A and K.
Also, none of the (B6 × bml)F1 recipients, which differed at the K locus alone,
produced detectable amounts of autoantibodies early during the GVHR; at weeks 8
and 14 only, one-third of these GVH F1 mice had antibodies against nuclear antigens
and 25% had antibodies against dsDNA (Table II). Furthermore, none of the GVH
F1 mice of this group had antibodies against thymocytes in their serum or became
Coombs' positive at any of the time points tested, and, significantly, none of them
developed elevated proteinuria. These findings indicate that an incompatibility at K
alone was insufficient to trigger a full-blown SLE-like syndrome, but, if at all, induced
only mild symptoms of chronic GVHD.
By contrast, 2 wk after the initiation of GVHR the vast majority of the I-A-different
(B6 × bm12)F1 recipients showed autoantibodies to thymocytes and nuclear antigens,
and, during the course of the GVHR, all (B6 × bml2)F1 recipients had these
autoantibodies at one or more of the times tested (Table II). IgG autoantibodies to
dsDNA were detectable from week 4 onwards, and 67% of the (B6 × bml2)Fi
recipients showed these antibodies at one or more times during the GVHR. Moreover,
42% of the GVH F1 mice were Coombs' positive at one or more of the times tested.
Elevated proteinuria occurred in 50% of the GVH (B6 × bml2)F1 recipients. One-
half of the mice with elevated proteinuria also developed ascites, indicating that these
GVH F1 mice had a severe nephrotic syndrome. Those GVH (B6 × bm 12)F1 recipients
which had elevated proteinuria also showed immunohistological evidence of ICGN.
Thus, incompatibility at I-A alone elicited a full-blown SLE-like GVHD.
B CellActivity in the Spleensof the ThreeKinds ofGVH FI Mice. As reported previously
(2), nonirradiated, H-2-different F1 mice developing acute GVHD initially (week 1)
showed a phase of strong B cell stimulation, which rapidly thereafter (week 2,) reversed
to severe B cell suppression. By contrast, Fa mice undergoing chronic GVHD showed
a continuing stimulation of their B cells (2). These observations were made in groups
of identical F1 mice that had been injected with genetically different T cells obtained
from one of the two parental strains, C57BL/10 and DBA/2, respectively. Very
similar results were made in the present study, where we injected genetically identical
donor cells into groups of F1 recipients that carried different H-2 mutations.
Groups of (bml × bml2)Fl, (B6 X bml)Fa, and (B6 × bml2)Fa mice were injected
with l0s B6 spleen cells. After 7 and 17 d, the spleen cells from the GVH F1 mice of
these groups were assayed for the total number of IgG- and IgM-secreting cells.
Groups of syngeneic N F1 mice served as controls. At 7 d after the initiation of the
GVHR, the numbers of IgG- and IgM-secreting cells per 106 spleen cells of the K-
and I-A-different (bml × bml2)F~ recipients were increased by factors of ~5.5 and 2,
respectively (Table III). In addition, the spleen weights of these GVH F1 animals
were increased by a factor of 2.4 (Table IV). At 17 d after the initiation of the GVHR
in such F1 mice, however, the numbers of IgG- and IgM-secreting spleen cells were
decreased by a factor of 3-4 (Table III), although the spleen weights were still
increased (Table IV). These findings indicate that induction of the GVHR in (bml
× bml2)Fx recipients, which differed by mutations at both I-A and K, initially (week

suppression.
At 7 d after the initiation of GVHR in (B6 × bml)F1 mice, which differed by the
K mutation only, the total numbers of IgG- and IgM-secreting cells per 10n spleen
cells were not significantly different from the numbers found in the spleens of the
corresponding N F1 mice (Table III). The spleen weights of these GVH Fa mice were
not significantly different from the spleen weights of N F1 mice (Table IV). At 17 d
762 GRAFT-VS.-HOST DISEASE MUTATIONS AT H-2K AND/OR I-A
after the initiation of the GVHR, the numbers of IgG- and IgM-secreting cells were
per 106 spleen cells slightly but not significantly increased. The mean spleen weight
of these GVH F1 animals was increased by a factor of 1.6 (Table IV). Thus, B6 donor
cells induced neither a strong stimulation nor suppression of the B cells in the K-
different (B6 ×bm 1)F1 recipients, and only a marginal splenomegaly was induced in
these F1 recipients.
7 d after the induction of the GVHR in the I-A-different (B6 × bml2)F1 mice, the
number of lgG-secreting cells per 106 nucleated spleen cells was increased by a factor
of 5.5, and the total number of IgM-secreting cells by a factor of about 1.6 (Table
III). At this point in time, the spleen weights of the GVH (B6 × bml2)F1 mice were
not different from those of the corresponding N F1 mice (Table IV). 17 d after the
initiation of the GVHR, the numbers of IgG- and IgM-secreting cells per 106 spleen
cells were increased by a factor of 5.7 and 3.4, respectively (Table III). At that time,
the spleen weights of the (B6 × bml2)Fa recipients were increased by a factor of 3.5
(Table IV), and the numbers of nucleated cells in the spleens were increased by a
factor of -2 when compared with the numbers in the spleens of N F1 mice. Therefore,
the total numbers of IgG- and IgM-secreting cells in the spleens of (B6 × bml2)Fa
recipients were, in fact, increased by factors of 11 and 7. These findings indicate that
B6 donor cells failed to suppress and exclusively stimulated the B cells of the I-A-
different (B6 × bml2)Fl recipients. Moreover, the number of IgG-secreting cells in
the spleens of the GVH (B6 × bml2)F1 mice, used for the induction of acute and
chronic GVHD (Fig. 1; Tables I and II), was increased by a factor of ~3 at time of
autopsy (day 112 after the induction of the GVHR) (data not shown). This indicates

The Activity of AlloreactiveDonor Tn and Ts Cellsin the Spleensof the ThreeKinds of GVH
FI Mice. It has been shown (2, 20) that spleen cells obtained from nonirradiated F1
mice suffering from acute GVHD (weeks 2-4) suppress the primary anti-SRBC
response of normal Fa spleen cells in vitro. This suppression was due to Fl-specific
alloreactive donor Ts cells (20, 23, 24), the activity of which peaked around day 10
after the initiation of the GVHR (2, 20). By contrast, spleen cells from GVH F1 mice
suffering from stimulatory GVHD failed to suppress the primary anti-SRBC response
of normal F1 spleen cells in vitro (2). To more precisely determine the alloantigens to
which donor TH and Ts cells, respectively, react, spleen cells obtained from the three
kinds of mutant GVH F1 mice were also tested in such an assay system.
As few as 6.4 × 104 spleen cells obtained from GVH (bml × bml2)Fa mice almost
completely suppressed the primary anti-SRBC response of 5 × l0Gnormal (bml ×
bml2)F1 spleen cells (Fig. 2). Thus, a mutation in the F1 recipients at both K and I-
A had led to maximal activation of B6 allosuppressor T cells in week 2 after the
induction of the GVHR. Spleen cells from GVH (B6 × bml)F1 mice, which differ at
the K locus only, also suppressed the primary anti-SRBC of normal (B6 × bml)Fa
spleen cells. This suppression, however, was far less profound when compared with
the suppression induced by GVH (bml × bml2)F1 spleen ceils. Spleen cells from
GVH (B6 × bml2)Fa mice failed to suppress but helped the primary anti-SRBC
response of normal (B6 ×bm 12)F1 spleen cells. Thus, a mutational difference between
donor and host at I-A alone appears to exclusively activate alloreactive donor TH
cells.
Discussion
There is increasing evidence that functionally different subsets of donor T cells,
which may act synergistically as well as antagonistically, are responsible for the wide
spectrum of different pathological GVH symptoms (2-5, 8, 9, 20, 23, 25).3 Hence, in
attempts to dissect the cellular mechanism underlying stimulatory and suppressive
GVH symptoms, respectively, it is crucial that assays be used which reflect the
different and sometimes even antagonistic functions of subsets of donor T cells. The
spleen weight assay and the popliteal lymph node weight assay do not measure
specific cellular function and preferentially reflect stimulatory rather than suppressive
activities of donor T cells. The GVH mortality assay, too, is inadequate because, at
least in nonirradiated recipients, it reflects the activity of alloreactive donor Ts cells
(4), but does not measure allohelp. Moreover, GVH mortality can greatly vary due to
nonimmunological factors, such as the quality of the microflora in the intestine of the
recipients (2, 26).
A GVH assay by which one can measure the activity of both alloreactive donor TH
and Ts cells has been described by Pickel and Hoffmann (20, 23). By using a parent
F1 hybrid combination differing at all of H-2, they showed that spleen cells
obtained from GVH F1 mice on day 3 after the initiation of GVHR exerted a positive
allogeneic effect on the primary anti-SRBC response of N F1 spleen cells in vitro; by
contrast, spleen cells obtained on days 7-20 exerted a negative allogeneic effect (20,
23). Allohelp in this system was provided by Fl-specific Lyt-1+2- donor T cells present
in the spleens of the GVH Fa mice (20, 23), whereas allosuppression was caused by F1-

specific Lyt-l+2 + donor T cells (20, 23, 24). In a preliminary report from our
laboratory, the results obtained by this assay system were found to correlate with the
histopathological changes taking place in the lympho-hemopoietic tissue of H-2-
different GVH F1 mice. It was shown that the activation of allosuppressor donor T
cells preceded and coincided with the pancytopenia characteristic of acute GVHD
(2). In addition, the protein-A PFC assay (19) was used as an indicator of total B cell
activity in the spleens of the GVH Fa mice. This assay, too, clearly reflected the
sequential activation of first allohelper and then allosuppressor donor T cells during
the first 3 wk after the initiation of the GVHR (2).
In the present investigation, the results obtained in H-2-mutant GVH F1 mice by
means of the Pickel and Hoffmann assay and the protein-A PFC assay were compared
with those obtained by more conventional GVH assays. A mutational difference, in
the F1 recipient, solely at I-A was shown to activate exclusively allohelper T cells of
the B6 donor and led to a continuous production of stimulatory GVH symptoms. By
contrast, a mutational difference at both I-A and K led to the sequential activation
of B6 allohelper and allosuppressor T cells. This rapid sequence of differential
alloactivation in vivo was closely paralleled by stimulatory and suppressive GVH
symptoms, respectively, as measured by more conventional GVH assays. A mutational
difference at K alone, however, failed to optimally activate either the allohelper or
the allosuppressor T cells of the B6 donor. The results of our studies are summarized
in Table V.
Induction of an SLE-like Stimulatory GVHD across an I-A Mutation. The bml2 mutant
is of the gain and loss type (27), maps to the I-A subregion (18), and consists of but
a limited number of peptide differences in the Aft polypeptide when compared with
B6 (28). Functional studies have shown that the mutation resulted in strong reciprocal
mixed lymphocyte reactions (18) and the generation of cytotoxic T cells (29) between
B6 and bm 12. By studying the genetic requirements for the induction of abnormal T-
B cell cooperation in vitro, we found that B6 T ceils can optimally help (positive
allogeneic effect), but cannot suppress (negative allogeneic effect) bml2 B cells in a
ROLINK ET AL. 765
primary anti-SRBC response.4Hence, it was concluded that, in vitro, the I-A mutation
difference triggers alloreactive Tri cells and no, or almost no, alloreactive Ts cells.4
The data presented here indicate that an I-A incompatibility in vivo preferentially
triggers the donor T cells responsible for the induction of SLE-like GVHD (Table V);
these T cells are the alloreactive TH cells (8, 9) possessing the Lyt-l+2- phenotype, a
Thus, both in vitro4 and in vivo, an I-A difference triggers alloreactive donor TH cells
and no, or almost no, alloreactive donor Ts cells. In the latter aspect, the I-A
incompatibility differs from an incompatibility at both I-A and K, which causes a
profound allosuppression both in vitro4 and in vivo (Table V).
In a previous paper (9), we showed that an I-E difference between the parental
donor and F1 host led to the induction of SLE-like GVHD. In vitro, the same I-E
difference induced allohelp but no allosuppression. 4 Thus, both in vitro and in vivo
(at least in nonirradiated F1 recipients), class II alloantigens (I-A and I-E) trigger
mainly alloreactive TH cells. It should be noted, however, that Swain and Dutton (30)
were able to measure allosuppression across class II differences only; but, as opposed
to our test system in vitro4and that of Cantor and Boyse (16), Swain and Dutton used
a population of primed spleen cells to which they added T cells differing at class II
alloantigens (30). Furthermore, Klein and Chiang (15), who used F1 recipient mice
that had been irradiated before the induction of GVHR, were able to induce LGVHD
across class II differences only. It is unlikely though that LGVHD in that system was
caused by alloreactive donor TH cells, because Lyt-l+2- donor cells were found to be
incapable of inducing LGVHD in irradiated F1 recipients across a total H-2 differ-
ence.3 One possible explanation for the discrepancy in the outcome of the GVHR in
irradiated and nonirradiated F1 mice differing at class II alloantigens is the difference
in susceptibility to LGVHD in both kinds of F1 recipients. Irradiated recipients are
much more sensitive than nonirradiated ones for the induction of LGVHD (31).
Therefore, it is possible that a low amount of allosuppression, which is ineffective in
nonirradiated F1 recipients, is effective in inducing LGVHD in irradiated F1 recipients.
Neither Acute nor Stimulato(y GVHD Were Induced across a Mutational Difference at the K
Locus Alone. Lymphocytes from bml and B6 produce a positive mixed lymphocyte
reaction in both directions (32), and bml-anti-B6 and B6-anti-bm 1 cytotoxic T cells
can also be generated (33, 34). Biochemical studies showed that the H-2K product of
the bm 1 mutant differs from the product of B6 by only two amino-acid substitutions
(35).
In the present study, the GVHR across this small H-2Kb mutational difference was
studied. Neither acute GVHD nor a full-blown SLE-like GVHD could be induced in
the (B6 × bml)Fa mice by injection of the B6 donor cells (Table V). Similar results
were obtained with combinations involving intra-H-2-recombinant strains that dif-
fered only at K or D (unpublished results). These findings indicate that a solely class
I (K mutation) difference between donor and host cannot optimally trigger the T
cells responsible for the induction of stimulatory GVHD or the T cells that induce
acute GVHD. A possible explanation for this might be the relatively low amount of
allohelp triggered by the H-2Kbmutation. Evidence from three different experimental
systems clearly indicates that the induction of both acute and stimulatory GVHD in
nonirradiated F1 mice requires strong allohelp (2, 20).a Although we4 and others (36,
37) showed that it is possible to generate allohelp as well as allosuppression across this
766 GRAFT-VS.HOST DISEASE MUTATIONS AT H-2K AND/OR I-A
H-2Ku mutation in vitro, the amount of allohelp was low when compared with the
amount triggered by class II molecules.4
The lack of distinct stimulatory and suppressive GVH symptoms triggered by the
H-2Ku mutation cannot be ascribed to a numerical deficit in the corresponding
alloreactive T cells. Swain et al. (36) reported that the precursor frequency of
alloreactive TH cells that can be triggered by the K mutation difference of bml, is
only a factor ~2 lower than the frequency of alloreactive TH cells triggered by a total
H-2 difference. Nevertheless, we found that increasing the number of donor cells (1.6
× l0s instead of 1 X 10s B6 cells) injected into the (B6 × bml)F1 mice still failed to
induce clear-cut stimulatory or suppressive GVHD (data not shown). Alternatively,
certain qualitative differences4 between the allohelper T cells triggered by class I (K
mutant) and class II (I-A mutant) might account for the observed differences in
GVHD elicited by the I-A or I-A plus K mutational differences on the one hand and
the K mutation alone on the other (Table V).
Induction of Acute GVHD across a K Plus I-A Difference. Our findings show that a
mutational difference at both I-A and K, but neither at I-A nor K alone, triggers the
donor T cells capable of inducing acute GVHD (Table V). In previous papers (2-5) 3
from our laboratory, evidence has been provided that acute GVHD is due to the
sequential activation of first alloreactive donor TH and eventually donor Ts cells. The
data presented here strongly support this concept. The stimulatory symptoms observed
in the (bm 1 × bm 12)F1 mice early after the injection of B6 donor cells can be ascribed
to alloreactive donor TH cells activated by the I-A mutation, whereas the ensuing
suppressive symptoms must have been caused by alloreactive donor Ts cells reacting
to the K mutation difference. Since no suppressive symptoms characteristic of acute
GVHD could be induced across a K mutation difference alone, i.e., in the combination
B6 ~ (B6 × bml)F1, obviously the alloreactive donor TH cells, triggered by the I-A
incompatibility, were needed for the activation of the alloreactive donor Ts cells.
Thus, two signals are required for the optimal induction of donor allosuppressor T
cells in vivo: a class II difference (I-A mutation) that elicits maximal allohelp, and the
additional existence of a class I difference (K mutation) to which the donor Ts cells
react. This requirement of both a specific antigenic difference (class I) and maximal
help elicited by a class II difference is identical with the requirements for the optimal
activation of cytotoxic T cells in vitro (38, 39). Furthermore, the need of activated TH
cells for the differentiation from Ts precursor to Ts effector cells follows the general
rules of the T cell circuit formulated by Cantor and Gershon (40). Apparently, this
sequence of events is also required for the induction of the allosuppressive effects
characteristic of acute GVHD.
The small antigenic difference between GVH (B6 X bml2)F1 and GVH (bml ×
bm 12)'F1 mice deserves comment. Although this difference was restricted to but two
amino acids in the K molecule (35), it caused an extraordinary difference in patho-
logical symptoms (Table V). Within the spectrum of GVH symptoms (3), these two
GVH combinations occupy exactly opposite positions, in that the former combination
developed the stimulatory symptoms of SLE-like GVHD, whereas the latter developed
the pancytopenia characteristic of acute GVHD. As we shall discuss below, this
finding might be able to improve our understanding of the association of certain
immunological diseases with structures of the major histocompatibility complex in
man, HLA.
ROLINK ET AL. 767
Comparisonwith EtiologicAgents CausingGVHR-like PathologicalChanges. Essentially
the same spectrum of stimulatory and suppressive symptoms as that induced by the
GVHR has been observed in patients exposed to sensitizing drugs or undergoing viral
infections (3). For instance, some of the patients sensitized to the drug diphenylhy-
dantoin show hypergammaglobulinemia and SLE-like autoantibodies, whereas others,
sensitized to the same drug, show hypogammaglobulinemia and/or aplastic anemia.
A similar GVH-like spectrum of different symptoms has been observed in patients
infected with Epstein-Barr virus (3). In view of this similarity of the pathological
symptoms, it has been postulated that the basic cellular mechanism underlying these
diseases might consist of GVH-like reactions of T cells to autologous lympho-hemo-
poietic cells or macrophages rendered foreign by the drug or the virus (3). Evidence
has been obtained from studies in mice that indeed diphenylhydantoin attaches to
the surface of lymphoid cells and then triggers GVH-like reactions by autologous T
cells (41, 42). The GVHR triggered by small mutational changes in the primary
structure of class I and/or class II alloantigens, as studied in the present investigation,
closely resembles this situation of "altered self." Conceivably, the combined recogni-
tion by autologous T cells of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) structures
and the respective etiologic agent might cause the GVH-like diseases observed in
individuals undergoing viral infections or exposed to sensitizing drugs. Furthermore,
our data indicate that possible somatic mutations that affect the MHC structures of
lymphoid cells might also lead to GVH-like diseases.
As has been discussed in detail elsewhere (9), products of the same locus, HLA-DR,
appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of SLE, irrespective of whether the disease
was idiopathic or induced by a drug. Because HLA-DR is a functional analogue of
the murine I-A/I-E loci (43), it is tempting to speculate that the cellular mechanism
responsible for the induction of SLE in humans is the same as the mechanism
responsible for the induction of SLE-like GVHD in mice (8, 9). By analogy, the
spontaneous development of suppressive GVH-like symptoms in patients might be
due to the combined recognition by autologous T cells of the etiologic agent and class
I as well as class II MHC structures. It is interesting, therefore, that in patients taking
diphenylhydantoin a low serum IgA level was associated with an increased frequency
of HLA-A2 (44). Whether there also exists a correlation with HLA-DR in such
patients is not currently known.
Summary
By induction of a graft-vs.-host reaction (GVHR) in nonirradiated H-2-different F1
mice, one can induce stimulatory pathological symptoms, such as lymphadenopathy
and hypergammaglobulinemia, combined with the production of autoantibodies
characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Alternatively, the GVHR can
lead to the suppressive pathological symptoms, such as pancytopenia and hypogam-
maglobulinemia, characteristic of acute GVH disease (GVHD). Whether stimulatory
or suppressive symptoms are induced by a GVHR depends, in our view (2-4), on the
functional subset of donor T cells activated in the F1 host. The purpose of the present
study was to investigate whether class I and/or class II H-2 alloantigens can selectively
trigger, out of a pool of unselected donor T ceils, those subpopulations of T cells
responsible for the stimulatory and suppressive GVH symptoms, respectively.
For the induction of the GVHR, l0s lymphoid cells from C57BL/6 (B6) donors
768 GRAFT-VS.-HOST DISEASE MUTATIONS AT H-2K AND/OR I-A
were injected into three kinds of F1 hybrid mice, which had been bred from H-2
mutant strains on a B6 background. Whereas the I-A-disparate (B6 X bml2)F1
recipiei~ts exclusively developed stimulatory GVH symptoms, including SLE-like
autoantibodies and immune complex glomerulonephritis, the K locus-disparate (B6
× bml)F1 recipients showed neither clearly stinmlatory nor clearly suppressive GVH
symptoms. In marked contrast, the (bml × bml2)F1 recipients, which differ from the
B6 donor strain by mutations at both K and I-A locus, initially developed stimulatory
GVH symptoms, but rapidly thereafter showed the suppressive pathological symptoms
of acute GVHD and died. Moreover, spleen cells obtained from (B6 X bm 12)F1 mice
injected with B6 donor ceils helped the primary anti-sheep erythrocyte (SRBC)
response of normal (B6 × bml2)F1 spleen cells in vitro, whereas spleen cells (bm l x
bml2)F1 mice injected with B6 donor cells strongly suppressed the primary anti-
SRBC response of normal (bml × bml2)F1 spleen cells. Spleen cells from the K locus-
disparate (B6 × bml)F~ recipients also suppressed the primary anti-SRBC of normal
(B6 × bml)F1 spleen cells; this suppression, however, was weak when compared with
the suppression induced by spleen cells from GVH (bm 1 × bml2)F1 mice.
Taken together, these findings indicate that a small class II (I-A) antigenic difference
suffices to trigger the alloreactive donor T helper cells causing SLE-like GVHD. In
contrast, both class I (H-2K) and class II (I-A) differences are required to trigger the
subsets of donor T ceils responsible for acute GVHD. It appears that atloreactive
donor T helper cells induce the alloreactive T suppressor cells, which then act as the
suppressor effector cells causing the pancytopenia of acute GVHD. These findings
may help to understand the variability of GVH-like diseases caused by a given
etiologic agent, their cellular pathogenesis, and association with certain HLA loci.
