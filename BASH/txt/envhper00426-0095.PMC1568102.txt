Hematotoxicity and Carcinogenicity of
Inhaled Benzene
by Eugene P. Cronkite,* Robert T. Drew,t Tohru Inoue,t
Yoko Hirabayashi,t and James E. Bullis*
CBA/Ca male mice have been exposed to benzene in air at 10, 25, 100, 300, 400, and 3000 ppm for variable
intervals 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for up to 16 weeks. Two weeks of inhaling 10 ppm produced no hematologic
effects; 25 ppm induced a significant lymphopenia. Inhalation of 100, 300, and 400 ppm produced dose-
dependent decreases in blood lymphocytes, bone marrow cellularity, marrow content ofspleen colony-forming
units (CFU-S) and an increased fraction of CFU-S in DNA synthesis. Exposure of mice to 300 ppm for 2, 4,
8, and 16 weeks produced severe lymphopenia and decrease in marrow CFU-S. Recovery was rapid and com-
plete after 2 and 4 weeks of exposure. After 8 and 16 weeks ofexposure, recovery of lymphocytes was com-
plete within 8 weeks. It took 16 weeks for the CFU-S to recover to that of the age-matched controls after
8 weeks of exposure and 25 weeks to recover to age-matched after 16 weeks of exposure. Inhalation of 3000
ppm for 8 days was less damaging than inhalation of300 ppm for 80 days (same integral amount ofbenzene
inhaled). The inhalation of 3000 ppm has not increased the incidence of leukemia or shortened its latency
for development. Inhalation of 300 ppm 6 hr/day for 16 weeks significantly increases the incidence of my-
elogenous neoplasms in male CBA/Ca mice. Inhalation of 100 ppm for same interval does not influence in-
cidence of myelogenous neoplasms but does increase incidence of solid neoplasms particularly in female
CBA/Ca mice. Benzene is a potent carcinogen in CBA/Ca mice.
Introduction
Presumably the first reference in the literature to
harmful effects from benzene is a report ofa case ofpur-
pura in 1897 (1). From 1897 through 1950 there were
sporadic case reports associating exposure to benzene to
the development of purpura and leukemia. These are
summarized by Bernard (2). These anecdotal observa-
tions clearly implicated benzene as a hematotoxin. In
1916-1917 (3,4) there were two studies on the role ofben-
zene as a leukotoxin. These studies investigated the de-
generation and regeneration of hematopoietic tissues of
animals.
The first convincing studies on the possible role ofben-
zene as a leukemogenic agent in human beings were those
ofAksoy et al. (5-8) and Vigliani and Saita (9). Aksoy (5,6)
reported that leukemia in benzene-exposed workers
decreased after the phase-out ofbenzene use in Istanbul,

and there was no leukemia observed in workers during
the last 3 years ofthe last study, implicating benzene as
a probable causative agent in the earlier intervals.
Detailed epidemiological studies have been performed
suggesting that there is a linear no-threshold dose-effect
relationship for induction of leukemia in man (10-13),
which is an unlikely relationship. There are a large num-
ber of uncertainties in the estimation of human cancer
risk because many ofthe important conditions with which
one is concerned lie outside the range of scientific obser-
vation. Infante and White (10,12,13) and the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (14) adopted the un-
proved one-hit linear model, which assumes no threshold
and that every incremental dose of benzene is accompa-
nied by an increment in the excess cancer risk. The one-
hit hypothesis assumes that there is a single, unique
chemical event that is irreversible, and when this event
is in DNA there is no repair ofthe injury. It is well known
that DNA is repaired at times almost completely by
known biochemical mechanisms.
Hoel et al. (15) point out that the relationship between
the applied dose and incidence ofcancer is frequently non-
linear, but the tumor response in some instances is lin-
ear with resultant concentration of DNA adducts in the
target organ. It is reasonable to assume that benzene
metabolites, at least in part, will result in DNA adducts
and that it is unlikely that fhe incidence ofleukemia will

follow a one-hit, no-threshold response to exposure with
graded concentrations of benzene. This may, however,
pertain to adducts of DNA with benzene metabolites.
Previous studies on experimental induction ofleukemia
and other neoplasms by benzene have generally involved
a lifetime exposure. The exposure regimen in the pres-
ent studies was based on the apparent exposure condi-
tions of human beings described by Aksoy et al. (5-8) and
Vigliani and Saita (9). Human beings commence work in
industry at 18 years or older, thus exposure in mice was
commenced at 12 to 14 weeks ofage, when they are sexu-
ally mature. It was assumed that human beings were ex-
posed for 16 weeks, approximately 15% oftheir lives and,
accordingly mice were exposed for about 15% of their
lifespan. The work days were mimicked by exposing mice
6 hr/day, 5 days/week. The general objectives of these
studies were a) to determine early and late effects ofben-
zene on hematopoietic stem cells and early effects on the
early hematopoietic progenitors, b) to compare the
hematologic effects induced by the same total amount of
benzene inhaled over short or long intervals, and c) to ob-
serve for the induction ofleukemia and other neoplasms
by the exposure regimen outlined above to 300 and 100
ppm of inhaled benzene.
Materials and Methods
Benzene Exposure
Mice were exposed to room air or air containing 10, 25,
100, 300, 400, or 3000 ppm benzene in chambers similar
to those described by Hinners et al. (16), an isolation sys-
tem described by Laskin et al. (17), or in glass jar cham-
bers like those described by Leach (18). Benzene concen-
trations were monitored via an automatic gas sampling
system coupled to a gas sampling loop Packard Model 417
gas chromatograph or by wet-chemical spectrophotomet-
ric analysis using a bubbler with ethanol as the absorb-
ing solution. Mice were allowed food and water ad libi-
tum except during exposure periods. Exposures were 6
hr/day, 5 consecutive days/week. When not in exposure
chambers animals were housed in temperature- and
humidity-controlled rooms on a 12-hr light/dark cycle. The
incoming air was passed through HEPA filters and ex-
hausted to the outside. Corn-cob bedding was sterilized
before use and rooms were maintained pathogen free.
Hematopoietic Stem Cells and
Early Progenitors
At various times during and after the exposure period
mice were removed from the control and benzene groups,
anesthetized by ether, bled from the orbital sinus, and
killed by cervical dislocation. Blood counts and assays for
stem cells were performed approximately 18 hr after ter-
mination of the exposure period or at the times desig-
nated. Peripheral blood values were determined with a
Technicon H-1 hematology analyzer.
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) were assayed by
removing hind legs and flushing out the bone marrow
from tibia and femur. Total marrow cellularity was deter-
mined from the resultant suspensions with a Coulter elec-
tronic counter. An aliquot of some bone marrow suspen-
sions was subjected to tritiated thymidine (H3Tdr)
cytocide (19) to determine fraction in DNA synthesis. The
spleen colony assay of Till and McCulloch (20) was used
for determination of the number of pluripotent
hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Recipient
mice were given 850 rad from 250 kVp, 30 mA GE Max-
itron X-ray machine with 1 mm aluminum and 0.5 mm
copper filtration at a dose rate of 90 to 100 rad/min for 2
hr before being used for assay. Fifty thousand nucleated
bone marrow cells from the individual or pooled suspen-
sions above were given IV. The recipients were killed 10
days after injection. The spleens were removed, fixed in
Bouin's solution, and the surface colonies counted.
To test the functional capacity ofthe stem cells in mice
exposed to benzene, a rescue assay was used. Animals
were exposed for 16 weeks to 300 ppm. Benzene-exposed
and sham-exposed, age-matched mice were allowed to re-
cover for more than 2 years (752 days). At that time they
were used as bone marrow donors to start a serial res-
cue assay in which recipients were fatally irradiated (850
rad) and then given 10 bone marrow cells IV from the
sham- or benzene-exposed donor groups. Surviving
recipients at 30 days after rescue transplant were then
used as bone marrow donors for a subsequent rescue as-
say. This procedure was carried out for three successive
rescues.
In selected experiments, assays of early progenitors of
erythrocytic cells and granulocytic cells were performed.
To culture the 2-day erythrocyte colony-forming units
(CFU-E), the method of McLeod et al. (21) was used.
Briefly, control and benzene-treated bone marrow
(femurs and tibias) were harvested in minimum essential
medium with 2% fetal calf serum. The suspensions were
passed through 26- and 27-gauge needles successively.
Total cell counts were determined by Coulter Electronic
Counter. After 48 hr ofincubation, the plasma clots were
fixed in situ in 5% glutaraldehyde, washed in water,
transferred to slides, and stained with benzidine and
hematoxylin. Four clots per group were scored for
erythrocytic colonies containing eight or more benzidine-
positive cells.
Eight-day burst-forming units (BFU-E-8) were cultured
in erythropoietin 2.5 units/mL and pokeweed-mitogen
condition medium (2.5% solution). A pokeweed mitogen-
conditioned medium was prepared as described by John-
son and Metcalf (22). The plasma clots were cultured at
370C, 7% carbon dioxide. Clots were harvested on days
3 and 8. Half the clots were fixed in 5% glutaraldehyde
and stained with benzidine and hematoxylin. Halfofthe
remaining clots were fixed in 10% formalin and stained
with acetylcholine esterase and hematoxylin in order to
identify megakaryocyte-containing clots. The clots were
surveyed at 7.5x magnification and a positive identifica-
tion of the colonies and bursts were made at 40x mag-
nification.
The assays for early progenitors of granulocytes and
98
HEMATOTOXICITY AND CARCINOGENESIS BY BENZENE
macrophages (CFU-G, CFU-GM) were performed in agar
cultures identical to the method of Pike and Robinson
(23).
Mice
In studies on long-term effects ofbenzene on peripheral
blood and HSC and leukemo-carcinogenesis, CBA/Ca
BNL male and female mice were used. Exposure ofmice
was commenced at 84 days ofage. Carcasses of dead mice
were opened and fixed in 5% buffered formalin. Tissues
were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 7 tim, and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin. In the serial rescue and some
other HSC studies, C57BL/6BNL male and female mice
were used. For some studies on the effects of benzene of
hematopoietic stem cells and early hematopoietic progen-
itors, Hale-Stoner BNL mice were used.
Results
Hematopoietic Stem Cells
These observations have been published previously
(24,25). After exposure to 400 ppm benzene, 6 hr/day, the
nucleated bone marrow cell count and the CFU-S per leg
decreased to about 25% of the age-matched controls af-
ter five exposure intervals. Concomitantly, the fraction
of CFU-S in DNA synthesis increased after 5 days ofex-
posure to 40 to 60% compared to 20% ofthe age-matched
controls. This was maintained through 91/2 weeks of ex-
posure. After termination the fraction in DNA synthesis
diminished to the age-matched control level by 15 days.
There was no significant increase during this interval in
the CFU-S level.
In other studies (25), C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 10,
25, 100, 300, or 400 ppm benzene, 6 hr/day, 5 consecutive
days/week, for 2 to 16 weeks. These studies showed no
effect on marrow cellularity after 10 or 25 ppm, with a sig-
nificant diminution in marrow cellularity at exposure to
100 ppm for 2 weeks. Similarly, there was a dose-
dependent effect on diminution of the CFU-S after 100
and 400 ppm. There was also a significant increase in the
fraction in DNA synthesis after 10 exposures to 100 and
400 ppm. Two weeks (10 exposures) to 10, 25, 100, and 400
ppm produced a dose-dependent diminution in lympho-
cytes but no effect upon granulocytes in the peripheral
blood. Two weeks after exposure for 2 or 4 weeks, the
stem cells had returned to the normal age-matched con-
trol level. After 8 weeks ofexposure, it took 16 weeks for
CFU-S to return to that ofthe age-matched controls. Af-
ter 16 weeks ofexposure there was a slow, nearly linear
return for 8 weeks with no further increase at 16 weeks
after exposure, but by 25 weeks the level was that ofthe
age-matched controls. The degree of lymphopenia was
nearly the same after 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks of exposure
with rapid recovery by 8 weeks after exposure to that of
the age-matched control animals.

four exposures there was no significant change in the
CFU-E. However, after 29 days, 48 days, and 65 days
there was a significant diminution in the number of
CFU-E. Seven days after termination of exposure there
had been no recovery, but by 12 days after exposure
there had been a marked increase to greater than twice
that of the age-ma'tched controls.

trol after one exposure. By 29 days after commencement
of exposure (22 exposures) very few 8-day bursts re-
mained assayable. Recovery was incomplete 12 days af-
ter termination of exposure.
Figure 2 also illustrates the changes in granulocyte-
macrophage aggregates seen in the plasma clots. There
is a smaller decrease in their number with recovery to
nearly that ofthe age-matched controls 12 days after ter-
mination of exposure.
Figure 3 illustrates the effect upon the CFU-GM in
agar culture plates. The data are presented as percent of
control and actual number of colonies counted in the
plates from the benzene-treated and the age-matched con-
trol mice. There is a suggestion of an increase in the
CFU-GM after commencement of exposure, but by 30
days there is a significant diminution and an apparent
partial recovery during continued exposure.
The rather marked changes in the assayable, early
erythropoietic progenitors was reflected in a decrease in
the red blood cell counts during the exposure to about 50
to 75% of the age-matched controls. There were lesser,
oscillating changes in the granulocyte level in the blood.
Figure 4 shows the results from the three successive
serial rescue transplants. The effectiveness ofbone mar-
row from sham-exposed donors was compared to that of
bone marrow from mice that had been exposed to ben-
zene 752 days earlier. All transplants consisted of 107
bone marrow cells. In the first rescue of mice that had
received 850 rad, the 30-day survival was 100%. At 290
days after rescue, 7% ofthe mice receiving bone marrow
from sham-exposed donors had died and 36% had died of
those receiving bone marrow from benzene-exposed
donors. Again, in the secondary transplant there were no
30-day deaths in the mice receiving bone marrow from

deaths commenced at 70 days after rescue in those
animals receiving bone marrow from the benzene-
exposed donors whereas there were no deaths in the mice
receiving bone marrow from the sham-exposed until
about 171 days after exposure. In the tertiary rescue the
recipients of the marrow from the original benzene-
exposed donors commenced dying early, and 50% were
dead by 30 days after exposure. By 245 days after ex-
posure 95% were dead, and the last animal died at 595
days after radiation. In contrast, with the mice receiving
marrow from the original sham-exposed, there was only
one death during the first 30 days with 50% ofthe animals
surviving about 375 days and the last animal dying at 594
days after irradiation.
Hematologic Effects of the Same Amount
of Benzene Inhaled over Short or Long
Periods
It was originally intended to compare the effect of in-
halation of benzene over 2 days compared to inhalation
of the same total amount over 20 days. To allow assays
1 day following final exposure, 316 ppm, 6 hr/day, 5
days/week for a total of 19 exposures, was compared to
3000 ppm, 6 hr/day for two successive exposures. Fig-
ure 5 shows the effects upon absolute neutrophil and
lymphocyte counts in the blood. There is a drastic reduc-
tion in the lymphocyte count after 19 exposures to 316
ppm from 7500 lymphocytes to 300 lymphocytes per
microliter. Two-day exposure to 3000 ppm resulted in a
reduction from 6700 in the sham-exposed to 3300/MiL in
the benzene-exposed 1 day after the end of exposure.

Thirty-two days after exposure there was still a marked
reduction in the lymphocyte level in the animals receiv-
ing 316 ppm over 19 days compared to the mice receiv-
ing 3000 ppm over 2 days. These differences still per-
sisted at 66 to 67 days and 214 days after exposure (Table
1).
The neutrophil counts 1 day after exposure showed a
significantly more severe neutropenia in the mice receiv-
ing 316 ppm for 19 exposures than in the mice receiving
3000 ppm in two exposures. Thirty-two days after ex-
posure and 66 to 67 days after exposure a slight neutrope-
nia was still present with no significant difference be-
tween the two exposure regimens. By 214 days after
exposure the mice that had been exposed to 3000 ppm
had recovered, but those that had been exposed to 316
ppm were still neutropenic.
Figure 6 shows the results of inhaled benzene on mar-
row cellularity and CFU-S content. One day after termi-
nation of exposure, the reduction in cellularity in the
animals receiving 316 ppm for 19 days was significantly
greater than that ofthe mice that received 3000 ppm over
2 consecutive days. At 32, 66 to 67, and 214 days after ex-
posure cellularity had returned to that of the sham-
exposed mice. The reduction in CFU-S content 1 day af-
ter exposure in the mice receiving 316 ppm for 19 days
was substantially and significantly greater than in the
animals receiving 3000 ppm for 2 consecutive days.
Thirty-two days after exposure the CFU-S content ofthe
marrow in the mice receiving 316 ppm was significantly
less than that ofthe sham-exposed animals, whereas the
mice that had received 3000 ppm for 2 consecutive days
the CFU-S had returned to that of the sham-exposed
animals. In the 300-ppm group CFU-S content ofmarrow
returned to sham levels by 66 days after exposure. How-
ever, in the 316-ppm group the CFU-S remained signifi-
cantly below the sham levels at 214 days after exposure.

Table 1 shows the actual differential leukocyte counts
in number per microliter in CBA/Ca BNL mice that in-
haled 316 ppm benzene for nineteen 6-hr sessions. All of
the cell types are reduced in number as compared to the
sham-exposed mice at 1 day. All absolute counts except
the large unstained cells (LUG) are depressed at 32, 67,
and 214 da.ys after exposure. Figure 7 shows the serial
changes in the bone marrow cellularity and CFS-S in
C57B1/6BNL mice that inhaled 300 ppm for eighty 6-hr
sessions compared to mice that inhaled 3000 ppm for
eight sessions-the same total amount over one-tenth the
time.
The marrow cellularity and CFU-S ofmice that inhaled
3000 ppm for eight sessions are depressed one day after
termination of exposure but rebound to age-matched con-
trol by 30 days after exposure. The decrease in marrow
cellularity of mice that inhaled 300 ppm for eighty ses-
sions is nearly the same as in mice that inhaled 3000 ppm
for eight sessions, but it takes 60 days to return to the
level of the age-matched, sham-exposed controls. The
CFU-S is decreased to 38% of sham-exposed controls in
mice that inhaled 300 ppm compared to 62% in the mice
that inhaled 3000 ppm. The recovery in the CFU-S was
much slower and incomplete 178 days after exposure.
Mortality and Neoplasia
Figure 8 shows the mortality in sham- and benzene-
exposed male and female CBAiCa BNL mice inhaling 300
ppm benzene 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 16 weeks. Deaths
commenced in the sham-exposed males at about 600 days
of age with a median lifespan of 1030 days compared to
deaths commencing during exposure in the male mice
with a median lifespan of 510 days. The sham-exposed fe-
males commenced dying at about 680 days of age with a
median life-span of 1100 days. This is compared to the fe-
male exposed mice that commenced dying shortly after
end of exposure with a median lifespan of 580 days. Un-
fortunately, the carcasses of the male mice that died dur-

ing exposure were not saved. It is assumed without proof
that they were dying from the sequelae of marrow
hypoplasia.
Figure 9 shows the appearance of myelogenous ne-
oplasms, which is the sum ofneoplasms resembling acute
myeloblastic and chronic granulocytic leukemia. None
were observed in the sham-exposed males. The benzene-
exposed males began to develop myelogenous neoplasms
shortly after exposure, attaining a 19.3% lifetime inci-
dence at about 530 days of age. Females developed my-
elogenous neoplasms later that first appeared at about
350 days of age with a lifetime incidence of 11.1%, com-
pared to a lifetime incidence in the sham-exposed females
of 2%. See Table 2 for statistical significance of differ-
ences.

the sham-exposed animals with first appearance at about
880 days of age in the males attaining a lifetime incidence
of 11.7% in the males and 8.3% in the females. In both
sexes benzene exposure results in an earlier onset in the
appearance of lymphomatous neoplasms to a lifetime in-
cidence of 7.4% in the females and 1.8% in the males. The
lifetime incidence is significantly lower in the benzene-
exposed males, and there is no significant difference in
the benzene-exposed females when compared with their
respective sham-exposed cohorts. It should be noted that
lymphomatous neoplasms occur spontaneously late in the
mouse's life. Due to the high mortality in the benzene-
exposed mice, few animals lived to an age at which these
diseases normally appear. See Table 1 for statistical sig-
nificance.
Figure 11 shows the occurrence of nonhematopoietic
and nonhepatic neoplasms of male and female mice that
inhaled 300 ppm ofbenzene for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week, for
16 weeks. These neoplsams are primarily a combination
of Harderian and Zymbal gland, squamous cell carcinoma,
mammary adenocarcinoma, and papillary adenocarci-
noma of the lung. In sham-exposed male mice these
tumors commenced at 780 days of age with a lifetime in-
cidence of 21.7%. In the benzene-exposed males appear-
ance commenced shortly after cessation of exposure
reaching a lifetime incidence of 52.6% (p > 0.001). In the
female sham-exposed (incidence 35.0%) these tumors com-
menced appearance at about 900 days of age. In the
benzene-exposed females these tumors commenced ap-
pearance at 360 days of age with a lifetime incidence of
79.6% (p > 0.001).
Among males exposed to benzene that died after com-
pletion of exposure and which were neoplasm-free on au-
topsy, one-half (3/6) were found to have hypoplastic or
aplastic bone marrow. This condition was first found at
339 days of age, 143 days after completion of exposure.
Among sham-exposed males, however, while the inci-
dence was similar (13/28), the first appearance was not un-
til 58Q days of age.
Among benzene-exposed females (1/4), the first inci-
dence of marrow failure came at 480 days of age while
among sham-exposed-females, though the incidence was
similar (2/7), the age at onset was much later (949 days
of age). These findings show that in animals that died
without neoplasm bone marrow hypoplasia/aplasia oc-
curred much earlier in benzene-treated groups.
Figure 12 shows the comparison of mortality in male
CBA/Ca BNL mice that inhaled 100 ppm 6 hr/day, 5
days/week, for 16 weeks. The sham-exposed mice com-
menced to die at 630 days ofage compared to deaths dur-
ing exposure to benzene. Unfortunately, the carcasses
were not saved, so cause of death during exposure is not
known. The median survival is 1020 days in sham-
exposed compared to 1000 days in benzene exposed. The

HEMATOTOXICITY AND CARCINOGENESIS BY BENZENE
Discussion
There have been many reports on the effect ofbenzene
on hematopoietic stem cells and early progenitors (24-31).
All studies show that benzene inhalation of 100 ppm or
more reduces the number ofhematopoietic stem cells and
early progenitors. Baarson et al. (28) showed that ex-
posure to 10 ppm 6 hr/day for 5 days/week for 178 days
reduces the BFU-E to 55% of controls after 66 days with
a return to normal despite continued exposure. CFU-E
fell to 5% of the level in sham-exposed mice with only a
modest decrease in red blood cell levels in the blood. If
the CFU-E is an obligatory pathway to the circulating
red cell, one would have expected a severe anemia 15%
ofnormal. As this did not happen, one wonders ifthe ben-
zene metabolites interfere with synthesis or function of
the CFU-E receptors so that the in vitro stimulating
molecules are ineffective. If the in vitro assays are cor-
rect, then the few remaining CFU-E must have a much
greater amplification or the in vitro CFU-E may not rep-
resent an obligatory step in vivo. Baarson et al. (unpub-
lished) found that consumption of 5% ethanol in drinking
water enhanced the effect of 10 ppm benzene in air. Seidel
et al. (31) exposed mice to 300 ppm 6 hr/day, 5 days/week,
for 16 weeks and observed changes in the CFU-E and
CFU-E of lesser magnitude than Baarson et al. (28).
Whether these represent strain differences or differences
in sensitivity ofthe in vitro cultures is unclear. Seidel et
al. (31) also showed that after 4 weeks of sham exposure
and benzene (300 ppm) exposure mice had almost an equal
reticulocyte response to bleeding, suggesting that anemia
to a large extent may be due to hemolysis. We have ob-
served intense hemosiderosis in spleens indicating hemol-
ysis. Our studies in Hale-Stoner male mice exposed to 400
ppm benzene for 9.5 weeks did not develop as severe a
decrease in CFU-E as in the Baarson et al. (28) study.
Whether this is because of strain differences or to differ-
ences in assay system is not known.
Moeschlin and Speck (29) and Kissling and Speck (30)
concluded that administration ofbenzene results in inhi-
bition of DNA synthesis in the bone marrow. The over-
all reduction of DNA synthesis in the bone marrow may
be the result of cell killing. Cronkite et al. (24,25) focused
on the hematopoietic stem cells determining the fraction
in DNA synthesis by 3H-thymidine cytocide. There is a
marked increase in the fraction of CFU-S in DNA syn-
thesis compensating for the reduced number of CFU-S
in the bone marrow, not a decrease in fraction in DNA
synthesis as reported earlier.
The serial transfer of syngeneic bone marrow in irradi-
ated hosts was first reported by van Bekkum and
Weyzen (32). Mice are fatally irradiated and then rescued
by large bone marrow transplant of 106 to 107 syngeneic
bone marrow cells. At variable times after irradiation and
rescue bone marrow transplantation, the survivors are
used for donors in the second rescue. This is repeated un-
til the bone marrow that has never been irradiated be-
comes exhausted. This has been termed decline in colony-
forming ability of marrow cells subjected to serial trans-
plantation into irradiated mice by Siminovitch, Till, and
McCulloch (33). This phenomenon of decline has been
studied by numerous investigators (33-41). Most inves-
tigators believe that the decline is due to exhaustion of
the finite mitotic capacity of the HSC. Our studies (un-
published) indicate that prolonged rests of 100 to 200 days
after three rescue transplants allow the HSC to regain
their mitotic capacity. Brecher et al. (unpublished) believe
decline in mitotic capacity is due to malfunction of the
marrow stroma in failing to provide adequate
hematopoietic molecular regulators. Studies reported
herein clearly show that bone marrow from mice that
have previously been exposed to benzene for 752 days is
less effective in maintaining long-term survival ofrescued
mice and declines more rapidly than the bone marrow
from the sham-exposed donors. Alternative explanations
are possible. The decline may be due to a) a long-standing
genetic injury to the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells
by failure to repair DNA adducts or other injury to DNA;
b) exhaustion ofthe Go stem cells by increasing the frac-
tion that were in DNA synthesis during the 16 weeks of
exposure to benzene thus exhausting the ultimate mitotic
capacity ofthe Go hematopoietic stem cells by repetitive
mitoses early in life; and c) a radiation effect on the
stromal cells ofthe recipient as suggested by Brecher (un-
published). This would suggest that the benzene-treated
stem cells are more susceptible to stromal defect.
The inhalation of316 ppm benzene for 19 days from an
exposure standpoint is equivalent to inhaling 3000 ppm
for 2 days (each equivalent to 6000 ppm days). However,
there are large differences in the hematologic effects. The
longer exposure to a lower concentration of benzene
results in a much greater hematotoxic effect. The greater
effect ofthe lower concentration ofbenzene over a longer
interval might be due to saturation of the enzymes that
metabolize benzene when inhaling 3000 ppm whereas in-
haling 300 ppm rather than 3000 ppm allows a larger frac-
tion of the benzene to be metabolized. This question
might be answered by measuring total phenol production
in both instances. A comparison of the effects of single
doses ofionizing radiation with chronic exposure to ioniz-
ing radiation is of collateral interest. Single doses ofioniz-
ing radiation are much more effective in cell killing and
carcinogenesis than the same amount ofionizing radiation
protracted over a longer time. This is generally assumed
to be due to repair of injury to DNA.
The reverse may be the case with exposure to benzene
with irreparable injury building up with time. In the case
of 3000 ppm benzene exposure for 6 hr/day, there is a
daily 18-hr interval for repair. In the case ofnineteen 6-hr
exposures to 300 ppm benzene 5 days/week, there is also
a daily 18-hr interval for repair and 60 hr from 4:00 P.M.
on Friday to 8:00 A.M. Monday. In the former case there
is either lesser injury or more repair. It had been in-
tended to repeat studies at more concentrations to see if
prolongation ofexposure to the same total amount ofben-
zene would continue to have a greater hematotoxic effect
and whether it would have a greater leukemogenic effect.
The inhalation of300 ppm 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 16
weeks drastically reduces the median survival time and
maximum survival time. A large fraction ofthe reduction

in survival time is due to an earlier onset and higher in-
cidence ofmalignant neoplasms. The deaths that occurred
during exposure are presumed due to the sequelae of
bone marrow-hypoplasia, but this is not known since the
carcasses were not saved. This assumption is supported
by the observation of earlier marrow hypoplasia in
benzene-exposed mice. In males and females there is a
highly significant increased incidence ofmyelogenous ne-
oplasms occurring earlier in life. There is also a very sig-
nificant, earlier and higher incidence ofneoplasms other
than hematopoietic and hepatic. These neoplasms consti-
tute a broad spectrum oftumors including squamous cell
carcinoma, mammary adenocarcinoma, Zymbal and
Harderian gland tumors, and papillary adenocarcinoma
ofthe lung. Lymphomatous neoplasms appear earlier in
the mice exposed to benzene than in the sham-exposed
mice. Lifetime incidence is slightly less in the case ofthe
benzene-exposed females, but in the case of the males is
significantly less.
Hepatic neoplasms appeared sooner in the benzene-
exposed mice with strikingly reduced lifetime incidence.
The reduction in incidence of specific types of neoplasms
in the mouse by benzene exposure is apparently a new
observation. The phenomenon, however, was first ob-
served by Hellman et al. (42) in the Fischer rat exposed
to ionizing radiation. This rat has a high spontaneous in-
cidence of acute myelogenous leukemia. Exposure to
ionizing radiation drastically reduces the incidence ofmy-
elogenous leukemia, but increases the incidence of mam-
mary adenocarcinoma. They termed this a paradoxical re-
sponse to ionizing radiation. Presumably, this is due to
radiosensitivity of the target cells for leukemia that
would produce the neoplasms spontaneously. It is as-
sumed that a comparable mechanism is operating in the
reduction by benzene of the incidence of neoplasms in
CBA/Ca BNL mice that have a high spontaneous inci-
dence. Stoner, Drew, and Bernstein (43) conducted life-
time benzene exposures to hairless mice. The incidence
ofleukemia was not increased. In fact, an interpretation
oftheir data suggests that exposure to benzene by inha-
lation may have suppressed the development ofleukemia.
The first experimental demonstration of carcinogene-
sis by benzene is that of Maltoni and Scarnato (44), who
administered large amounts ofbenzene by stomach tube
for long periods oftime in the Sprague-Dawley rats. They
developed a wide spectrum of malignant and nonmalig-
nant neoplasms.
Snyder et al. (45) exposed C57BL/6 and AKR mice to
300 ppm, 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for a lifetime. There was
a significant increase in the incidence of leukemia and
lymphoma. In studies on rats exposed to 100 ppm for life-
time, a single case of chronic myelogenous leukemia, a
rarity in the rat, was observed by Goldstein et al. (46).
Another study by Snyder et al. (47) showed severe
hematoxicity after inhaling 100 ppm benzene in air, but
no significant increase in hematopoietic neoplasms. There
was a significant increase in the nonhematopoietic neo-
plasms. A recent monograph ou benzene carcinogenicity
by Askoy (48) repeatedly points out that there is no ani-
mal model for benzene induction of acute myelogenous
leukemia. Our studies correct this deficiency.
Harigaya et al. (49) adopted another approach for the
detection of hematotoxicity ofbenzene and possible car-
cinogenic effect. In these studies C57BL/6J mice were ex-
posed to 400 ppm benzene 6 hr/day, for either 9 days or
for 11 consecutive days. Long-term bone marrow cultures
of bone marrow from benzene-exposed mice showed a
progressive reduction in the number of spleen-colony
forming cells compared to bone marrow from control
mice. Different combinations of adherent cells and
reinoculated cells showed that cultures containing bone
marrow cells from benzene-exposed mice had a lower ca-
pacity to maintain stem cell proliferation in normal com-
binations irrespective of whether benzene-exposed mar-
row was in the adherent cell layers or reinoculated cells.
Clearly, benzene inhalation of this magnitude produces
stem cell injury leading to diminished self-replication and
derangement of the adherent marrow population. The
long-term marrow cultures from the benzene-treated
mice did not develop detectable transformation in vitro
throughout the culture period. Neonatal mice inoculated
with cultured cells from the benzene-exposed mice did not
develop leukemia during an 8-month period after inocu-
lation when the study was terminated. Subsequent
studies suggest that a longer exposure of donor mice and
a longer observation of the recipient mice may be indi-
cated.
It has been known for years by the present investiga-
tors that four strains of mice developed an increased in-
cidence ofacute myelogenous leukemia after exposure to
ionizing radiation (50-54). The RFM strain is less desira-
ble because of expense and it has a high spontaneous in-
cidence of acute myeloblastic and other leukemias. The
C3H/He male mouse has a low spontaneous incidence of
acute myeloblastic leukemia, but the female has such a
high and early incidence of mammary neoplasms that it
would be undesirable. The SJL/J mouse is rather expen-
sive and less easily obtained in numbers. The CBA/H
male mouse in England has a very low incidence ofacute
myeloblastic leukemia (< 1%), but responds to exposure
to ionizing radiation with a high incidence. The CBA/Ca
from Jackson Laboratories comes from the same stock as
the CBA/H in England and was therefore chosen as the
best and most economical ofthe four strains known to de-
velop acute myeloblastic leukemia. The choice appears to
have provided a good animal model for the study ofben-
zene leukemogenesis and should be suitable for establish-
ment ofthe needed benzene dose-effect curves for acute
myelogenous and other leukemias. Our data suggest that
there may be an effective time-dose relation (or concen-
tration) of benzene that may not increase the incidence
of myelogenous neoplasms, but will induce other ne-
oplasms. Our data suggest that exposure to 100 ppm ben-
zene 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 16 weeks may be close to
such a time-dose threshold for myelogenous leukemias.
