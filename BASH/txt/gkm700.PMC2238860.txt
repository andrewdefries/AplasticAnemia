ABSTRACT
Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that
extends DNA at the chromosome ends in most
eukaryotes. Since 1985, telomerase has been stud-
ied intensively and components of the telomerase
complex have been identified from over 160 eukary-
otic species. In the last two decades, there has
been a growing interest in studying telomerase
owing to its vital role in chromosome stability and
cellular immortality. To keep up with the remarkable
explosion of knowledge about telomerase, we
compiled information related to telomerase in an
exhaustive database called the Telomerase
Database (http://telomerase.asu.edu/). The Telo-
merase Database provides comprehensive informa-
tion about (i) sequences of the RNA and protein
subunits of telomerase, (ii) sequence alignments
based on the phylogenetic relationship and
structure, (iii) secondary structures of the RNA
component and tertiary structures of various sub-
units of telomerase, (iv) mutations of telomerase
components found in human patients and (v) active
researchers who contributed to the wealth of
current knowledge on telomerase. The information
is hierarchically organized by the components,
i.e. the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT),
telomerase RNA (TR) and other telomerase-
associated proteins. The Telomerase Database is
a useful resource especially for researchers who are
interested in investigating the structure, function,
evolution and medical relevance of the telomerase
enzyme.
INTRODUCTION
Eukaryotic chromosomes are linear DNA molecules
that contain special structures, called telomeres, which
cap the ends of chromosomes to protect against
end-to-end fusion or apoptosis (1,2). With a few excep-
tions from some insects, the telomeric DNA sequences are
usually simple tandem repeats, e.g. (TTAGGG)n as
in humans. During DNA replication, telomeric DNA
shortens progressively mainly due to the end-replication
problem (3,4). To overcome this problem, eukaryotic
cells have evolved with a specialized reverse transcriptase
(RT) enzyme, called telomerase, which functions to
counteract this continuous degradation of telomeres by
adding telomeric DNA repeats to the 30
-ends of chromo-
somes (5).
Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex composed
of two essential core components, the telomerase reverse
transcriptase (TERT) protein and the telomerase RNA
(TR), as well as several telomerase-associated accessorial
proteins. The catalytic TERT protein synthesizes telo-
meric DNA repeats using a short sequence in the TR
component as a template (6,7). The TERT gene was ﬁrst
identiﬁed in 1997 from the ciliate, Euplotes aediculatus
and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (8). Since then,
homologs of TERT have been identiﬁed in 105 species.
TR sequences have currently been identiﬁed in 28 ciliates
(9–11), 14 yeasts (12,13) and 43 vertebrates (14). The
size of TR varies dramatically from 150 nt in ciliates,
to 312–556 nt in vertebrates, and to over 1500 nt in yeasts.
Remarkably, there is no similarity in TR sequence
between these three groups of species. As a result, secon-
dary structure models of TR have been independently
established for each group of species using phylogenetic
comparative analysis. The structures of TR from ciliates,
yeasts and vertebrates share a similar pseudoknot struc-
ture near the template region, but vary substantially due
to additional species-speciﬁc structural elements. For
example, in addition to the universal pseudoknot
domain, vertebrate TR contains the CR4–CR5 domain
which is essential for enzymatic activity and the sno/
scaRNA domain which is critical for TR biogenesis.
Due to its unusual evolutionary divergence, the
telomerase holoenzyme varies signiﬁcantly in its com-
position among diﬀerent groups of species. A large
number of putative telomerase-associated proteins have
been identiﬁed in diﬀerent groups of species through

biochemical analyses such as UV cross-linking or
immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, most of these
proteins interact with telomerase in a species-speciﬁc
manner. For example, the dyskerin protein complex
appears to be associated with vertebrate telomerase (15),
but not with yeast or ciliate telomerases. Since these
associated proteins are not necessary to reconstitute
telomerase activity in vitro, they likely function in the
regulation and/or biogenesis of telomerase in vivo.
However, the actual roles of many of these proteins
remain unknown.
Structural studies of telomerase using NMR and
crystallography have been limited to small structural
domains or elements of the core components, TERT and
TR. For the TERT protein, only the N-terminal TEN
domain of Tetrahymena TERT has been successfully
crystallized and the structure determined (16). However,
the central portion of TERT protein contains seven
motifs called RT motifs (1, 2, A, B, C, D, E) that are
highly conserved among all reverse transcriptases. The
RT domain of TERT likely folds into a structure similar
to the available crystal structures of HIV and MMLV RTs
(17,18). For this reason, the structure of HIV RT domain
has often been used as a structural model for the TERT
RT domain. For the TR component, while the secondary
structure is known, the tertiary structure of the full-length
RNA has not been determined. Nevertheless, NMR
solution structures are available for helix II and stem-
loop IV of Tetrahymena TR (19–21), as well as the
pseudoknot (P2b/P3), P6 and P6.1 helices of human TR
(22–24). While structural studies of small RNA and
protein fragments have provided useful information, the
structure of a catalytically active TR–protein complex will
ultimately help reveal the mechanism of how this unique
DNA polymerase functions.
Telomerase plays a vital role in the cellular immortality
of stem cells. Mutations in telomerase genes aﬀect the
proliferation capacity of stem cells and have been linked
to three human diseases, dyskeratosis congenita (DKC),
aplastic anemia (AA) and idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis
(IPF) (25–27). The reduction of telomerase activity
correlates to telomere shortening and reduced proliferative
capacity in cells from patients. The three types of DKC:
(i) the X-linked-recessive, (ii) autosomal dominant and
(iii) autosomal recessive, have been linked to mutations
in the dyskerin gene (DKC1), TERT and TR genes and
Nop10 gene, respectively (28–31). AA and IPF have been
linked to mutations in both TERT and TR genes
(26,27,32,33). It is puzzling that mutations in the TERT
or TR gene at diﬀerent sites can cause an array of clinical
presentations associated with DKC, AA and/or IPF.
The molecular mechanism explaining the unusual phe-
nomenon of which mutations in the same gene cause these
diseases remains to be elucidated.
The unusual evolutionary divergence of telomerase and
its important role in cancer, aging and human diseases
have attracted a great number of researchers who are
devoted to telomerase research. This database aims to
facilitate and expedite the research on telomerase biology
by providing a comprehensive collection of information as
a useful and accessible resource.
CONTENT OF THE DATABASE
The purpose of the Telomerase Database is to compile and
organize known information about the telomerase ribo-
nucleoprotein. Currently, components of the telomerase
complex have been identiﬁed from over 160 diﬀerent
eukaryotic species. Structural information has also been
available for several domains of the RNA and several
protein subunits. Furthermore, multiple human diseases
such as DKC, AA and IPF have been linked to a large
number of mutations found in telomerase component
genes. In the database, information is organized into
six major pages: (i) Home/Overview, (ii) Sequences,
(iii) Alignments, (iv) Structures, (v) Diseases and (vi)
Researchers. The detailed features of these six main pages
and other sub-level pages are described individually
below.
Overview
The overview page within the main ‘Home’ page gives a
broad and historical introduction to telomerase research
for the general public and research scientists who are
interested in telomerase. It also describes the organization
of the database content, nomenclature of each telomerase
component and other general information.
Sequences
The sequence page includes gene and protein sequences of
telomerase components from over 160 eukaryotic species.
Most sequences were obtained from GenBank (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and have GenBank accession
numbers assigned, while some sequences have not been
deposited and were derived from original publications.
The GenBank records and literature references for each
sequence are provided through hyperlinks to NCBI.
Partial or hypothetical sequences derived from genome
sequencing or EST projects are indicated accordingly.
The main ‘Sequences’ page contains a table summariz-
ing all the sequence data collected in the database.
Sequence data were grouped in taxonomical order
into eight individual tables: vertebrates, invertebrates,
fungi, plants, algae, ciliates, other protists and viruses.
Each table contains sequence data for TERT, TR, other
telomerase-associated components and telomere repeats,
presented as four individual columns. For the TERT and
TR sequences, GenBank accession numbers are shown
and linked directly to the original GenBank records.
While the TERT genes have been identiﬁed in 105 species
spanning across almost every major group of species, the
TR gene has only been identiﬁed in 85 species from three
groups of species, 28 ciliates, 14 yeasts and 43 vertebrates.
To date, TR sequences have not been identiﬁed in
invertebrates, plants, algae and non-ciliate protists.
Interestingly, only 26 among these 164 species have had
both their TERT and TR components identiﬁed. Other
telomerase-associated protein components from human,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe,
Tetrahymena thermophila and Euplotes aediculatus are
listed. Known telomere repeat sequences from 89 species
are shown.

Four sub-level pages, designated as the ‘TR sequences’,
‘TERT sequences’, ‘Other components’ and ‘Telomere
sequences’, provide more detailed information derived
from the primary sequences. For example, in addition
to the GenBank accession numbers, the sub-level TERT
sequences page includes information such as the length,
GC content, sequence in text format and literature
reference of each sequence (Figure 1).
Alignments
The ‘Alignments’ page provides multiple sequence align-
ments for the telomerase core components, TERT and
TR and telomerase-associated proteins such as dyskerin,
Nop10, Gar1, NHP2, Est1 and Est3. To ensure accuracy
of these results, partial and putative sequences were
excluded from the sequence alignment. Due to the
lack of sequence similarity between groups of species,
TR sequences from vertebrates, Saccharomyces,
Kluyveromyces, Tetrahymena, Paramecium and Euplotes
were aligned independently. The alignments of TR
sequences were performed manually based on structural
information and sequence conservation. Compared to
TR, the amino acid sequences of TERT are relatively
conserved across all eukaryotes, especially in the central
RT domain. Nonetheless, the N-terminal and C-terminal
domains of TERT from several species, such as nema-
todes, Plasmodium and sea squirts, are variable contain-
ing truncations, insertions and sequence variations.
To achieve a more accurate and meaningful alignment,
full-length TERT sequences from diﬀerent groups, i.e.
vertebrates, invertebrates, fungi, plants/algae, ciliates and
other protists, were aligned independently. The sequences
of the conserved RT domain from all known TERT
proteins were aligned. The aligned sequences can either be
viewed online in a separate window or be downloaded in
the rich text or plain text ﬁle format. For each sequence
alignment, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using
either the MEGA 3.1 program or the DNAML program
from the Phylip package v.3.66 to reveal the evolutionary
relationship between sequences. The phylogenetic trees
can either be viewed online in a separate window or
downloaded in the JPG or PDF ﬁle format.
Structures
The ‘Structures’ page includes secondary structures for the
TR and tertiary structures of the TR, TERT, telomerase-
associated proteins and telomere-binding proteins.
The secondary structure section includes TRs from
vertebrates, fungi and ciliates. These secondary structure
models were generated based on the sequence alignments
Figure 1. A snapshot of the TERT sequences page of the database. The TERT sequence table includes detailed information for each sequence, i.e.
nucleotide length, GC content, amino acid length, pKi, molecular weight, GenBank accession numbers, sequences in text format and references.
Nucleic Acids Research, 2008, Vol. 36, Database issue D341
as well as published structures. The RNA secondary
structures are available for download in both JPG and
PDF formats and can also be viewed online.
The tertiary structures of diﬀerent telomerase compo-
nents, including TR and TERT fragments, are grouped by
component and sorted by species. The PDB ﬁles that
describe atomic coordinates of the structures are available
for download directly from this database or through links
to the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/).
Diseases
The ‘Diseases’ page summarizes disease-related mutations
found in genes encoding various telomerase components,
TR, TERT, dyskerin encoded by the DKC1 gene and
Nop10. The disease background section brieﬂy describes
the association of telomerase mutations with the three
human diseases, DKC, AA and IPF. DKC has three
distinctive forms, X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant
and autosomal recessive. To date, 25 mutations in TR,
18 mutations in TERT, 44 mutations in the DKC1 gene
and 1 Nop10 mutation have been identiﬁed in patients
with one or more of the three diseases. The positions of
each mutation are indicated on the secondary structure
of the TR component, or on the ﬁgures that illustrate the
organization of protein motifs or the positions of exons
and introns of the protein genes. Detailed information
such as the nucleotide position, identity or nature of the
mutations, the presentation of the disease in patients, and
the literature references that describe the mutation are
listed in individual tables.
Researchers
The last page is the ‘Researchers’ page listing the names
and aﬃliations of over 150 principle investigators who
have and continue to contribute to the wealth of knowl-
edge on the telomerase enzyme. The objective of the list
is to facilitate communications and interactions among
researchers, which will then promote collaborations, e.g.
sharing of reagents, unpublished results or ideas. The large
number of researchers in the telomerase ﬁeld reﬂects the
importance and medical potential of this unique enzyme.
DATABASE ACCESS
The Telomerase Database is accessible via the World
Wide Web at http://telomerase.asu.edu. The database was
constructed with the intention of cross platform/browser
accessibility. The database contents can be easily browsed
using Internet Explorer for PC, Safari for Mac or Firefox
for PC/Mac and the ﬁles can be downloaded in several ﬁle
formats. To create a more uniform user interface, elements
available for download are displayed as hyperlinks for
each of the ﬁle formats, while buttons generate a separate
window for online viewing of sequences, alignments
and structures. Literature references are linked to
PubMed, where the abstracts can be retrieved immedi-
ately. A feedback button has been included in most pages
to allow users to actively participate in the improvement
of the database.
FUTURE WORK
The sequence pages will be expanded as more TR and
TERT sequences are identiﬁed. The sequence alignments
will continuously be reﬁned as new sequences are added to
the database. The collection of RNA secondary structures
will be expanded to ultimately include all identiﬁed TRs.
In the next release, we plan to include more comprehen-
sive information on telomerase-associated proteins and
telomere-binding proteins. The database will be updated
regularly to include newly published sequences and new
mutations identiﬁed from patients.
