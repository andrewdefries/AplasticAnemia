Abstract
Recent studies have suggested that the presence of iron overload prior to stem cell transplantation
is associated with decreased survival. Within these studies, the criteria used to define iron overload
have varied considerably. Given the lack of consensus regarding the definition of iron overload in
the transplant setting, we sought to methodically examine iron status among transplant patients.
We studied 78 consecutive patients at risk for transfusion-related iron overload (diagnoses
included AML, ALL, MDS, and aplastic anemia) who received either autologous or allogeneic stem
cell transplant. Multiple measures of iron status were collected prior to transplantation and
examined for their association with survival. Using this data, three potentially prognostic iron
measures were identified and incorporated into a rational and unified scoring system. The resulting
Transplant Iron Score assigns a point for each of the following variables: (1) greater than 25 red cell
units transfused prior to transplantation; (2) serum ferritin > 1000 ng/ml; and (3) a semi-
quantitative bone marrow iron stain of 6+. In our cohort, the score (range 0 to 3) was more closely
associated with survival than any available single iron parameter. In multivariate analysis, we
observed an independent effect of iron overload on transplant survival (p = 0.01) primarily
attributable to an increase in early treatment-related deaths (p = 0.02) and lethal infections. In
subgroup analysis, the predictive power of the iron score was most pronounced among allogeneic
transplant patients, where a high score (≥ 2) was associated with a 50% absolute decrease in
survival at one year. In summary, our results lend further credence to the notion that iron overload
prior to transplant is detrimental and suggest iron overload may predispose to a higher rate of
lethal infections.

Introduction
Long-standing iron overload can lead to heart and liver
failure, resulting in premature death [1]. As our ability to
treat iron overload improves, it is increasingly important
to identify patients at risk for developing complications
secondary to iron overload. Stem cell transplant patients
are at risk for excess accumulation of iron resulting from
repeated blood transfusions both before and during trans-
plantation [2]. Because of this risk, it is recommended that
transplant survivors with good long-term prognoses be
assessed for iron overload [3]. Because iron overload has
been perceived to be of primarily long term detriment, the
measurement of iron status prior to transplant has not rou-
tinely been performed. However, recent evidence suggests
that the determination of iron status before transplant has
important prognostic implications [4-6].
Iron overload prior to transplantation was initially identi-
fied as a marker of poor prognosis in pediatric β-tha-
lassemia patients [7]. Among those allogeneic transplant
recipients, the presence of iron-induced portal fibrosis or
hepatomegaly was associated with decreased survival. A
later study by Altes et al. suggested that iron overload also
adversely impacted those with hematologic malignancies
[4]. In that study, very high levels of serum ferritin and
transferrin saturation greater than 100% were used as sur-
rogates for iron overload. Meanwhile, a larger study by
Armand et al. defined iron overload based solely on
serum ferritin, using the highest quartile for each disease
type [6]. Using that definition of iron overload, a signifi-
cant association with transplant survival was seen in
patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute
myeloid leukemia (AML).
While each of these retrospective studies suggests that iron
overload adversely affects transplant outcome, the clinical
definition of iron overload varied considerably between
studies. We set out to examine multiple measures of pre-
transplant iron status with the goal of determining which
marker(s) were most closely associated with clinical out-
come following transplant. We chose to study patients at
risk for transfusion related iron overload (diagnoses
included acute leukemia, MDS, and aplastic anemia)
undergoing either autologous or allogeneic transplant.
Three measures related to transfusional iron overload
were closely associated with transplant survival: (1)
number of blood unit transfusions, (2) serum ferritin, and
(3) bone marrow iron stores. These readily available
measures were combined into a clinical scoring system
termed the Transplant Iron Score.
The Transplant Iron Score showed a strong independent
association with overall survival. Our findings further val-
idate the detrimental impact of iron overload in the set-
ting of stem cell transplantation and identify a potential
mechanism of action.
Methods
We evaluated 78 consecutive adult patients admitted to
the Wake Forest transplant unit with a diagnosis of AML,
MDS, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or aplastic
anemia. The included patients were all undergoing their
first hematopoietic stem cell transplant between Septem-
ber 9, 1999 and March 19, 2004. The patient demograph-
ics and characteristics are summarized in Table 1. This
study was approved by both the Protocol Review Com-
mittee of the Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake For-
est University and the Institutional Review Board of Wake
Forest University School of Medicine.
All serum samples were obtained upon admission to our
bone marrow transplant unit, prior to the initiation of the
preparative chemotherapy. Samples were continuously
stored at -20°C, until measurements of iron parameters
were performed. Serum ferritin levels were measured
using a two-site chemiluminometric sandwich immu-
noassay (ADVIA Centaur® Ferritin assay, Bayer Diagnos-
tics, Tarrytown, NY). Transferrin saturation was calculated
using the method by Huebers and Finch [8]. Serum levels
of transferrin receptor (sTfR) were measured using a com-
mercially available sandwich enzyme immunoassay (EIA)
(Ramco Laboratories, Inc. Stafford, TX). C-reactive protein
was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (high sensitivity) kit from American Laboratory
Products Company, Windham, NH. The kit shows no
cross-reactivity against albumin, lysozyme, alpha-1 antit-
rypsin and other acute phase proteins. Values for aspartate
transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), total
bilirubin (TB), and the international normalized ratio
(INR) for blood clotting time were obtained by review of
the medical record. All recorded values were within 1
month of the admission date to our unit.
Bone marrow samples obtained within two months of
transplantation were reviewed by two of the authors for
specimen adequacy (I.M. and Z.L.), and representative
sections of the patient's samples were stained with the
Gomori's iron stain method [9]. Iron content of the bone
marrow was graded by one of the authors (Z.L.) who was
blinded to patients' laboratory and clinical parameters.
Grading of marrow iron stores was scored according to
previously published methods using a 0 to 6+ classifica-
tion scheme described in detail by Gale et al [10]. Higher
grades were associated with increased visible iron with a
score of 6+ having large visible iron clumps that obscure
cellular details. The number of packed red cell blood cell
(pRBC) transfusions prior to transplantation was deter-
mined by blood bank records. The ejection fraction (EF)
for each patient was based on the most recent pre-trans-

plant echocardiogram or MUGA scan. All measures of EF
were performed within 3 months of stem cell transplant.
The highest quartile of total transaminases, TB, and INR
among our study group was used as a surrogate for early
liver dysfunction, while the lowest quartile of EFs was
used to identify early pre-existing heart dysfunction.
Based on univariate quartile analysis, the three iron
parameters with the strongest survival association were
identified. Cutoff values for each parameter were deter-
mined independently using comparative statistics. Using
this method, multiple pre-defined cutoffs were examined
and compared for their association with survival. In order
to maintain an adequate sample size on both sides of the
cutoff, only values within the second and third quartile
were considered. The selected cutoff values demonstrated
the highest ability to discriminate survival based on a
comparative analysis of hazard ratios.
Ultimately, these three iron parameters were incorporated
into a unified scoring system. For each patient, a score was
calculated by assigning a single point for each of the fol-
lowing: (1) serum ferritin ≥ 1,000 ng/mL, (2) greater than
25 transfused units of red cells, and (3) marrow iron stain
of 6+. The sum of points, ranging between 0 and 3, was
defined as the Transplant Iron Score. For missing data, no
points were assigned. In the single patient where less than
two parameters were available for scoring, the iron score
was deemed indeterminate and was excluded from addi-
tional statistical analysis. The remaining 77 patients (99
percent) were included for analysis in our study. To allow
further analysis within our study, a score of two or greater
was deemed "high" and those patients were considered to
have transfusion related iron overload. Meanwhile, a
score of zero or one was classified as a "low" score. For
purposes of comparing the Transplant Iron Score to other
individual or combinations of iron parameters, each iron
parameter was scaled be scored on a 0 to 3 scale. Using
this approach, the individual iron parameters were
divided into one of four quartile groups, similar to the
four possible score groups defined by the Transplant Iron
Score. Based on these groupings, a univariate relative risk
of death was calculated for each iron parameter using haz-
ard regression analysis.
Survival time was measured from the date of transplant to
the date of death or last known follow-up. All data was
censored as of July 1st 2007. The following clinical and
demographic parameters were collected for statistical
analysis: age at the time of transplant, gender, diagnosis,

disease status (no remission, first remission, second
remission), transplant type (autologous, related or unre-
lated allogeneic stem cell transplantation), and cytoge-
netic data for acute myeloid leukemia patients at the time
of diagnosis. Cytogenetic information was grouped into
poor, average and favorable categories based on the study
by Byrd et al [11]. The specific cause of death for each
patient was determined by chart review and categorized
into disease related mortality, treatment related mortality,
or not determined. All deaths following documented dis-
ease relapse were categorized as disease related mortality.
Deaths attributable to treatment related mortality were
further subdivided into deaths resulting from infection,
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), or veno-occlusive dis-
ease (VOD) of the liver. Documented infectious deaths
were defined by the presence of a positive culture. Cases
of suspected lethal infection met strict criteria for sepsis
including radiologic imaging consistent with infection
[12]. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate median
survival and overall survival differences. Cox proportional
hazards regression was used to perform multivariate anal-
ysis. Results were considered significant when p-values
were less than 0.05.
Results
Multiple measures related to iron homeostasis were col-
lected prior to stem cell transplant and are listed in Table
2. The individual iron parameter most closely associated
with overall survival was the transfusion total, defined as
the number of red cell units received prior to transplant.
For each increase in quartile (e.g. 50th to 75th quartile) of
transfused blood, the risk of death following transplant
increased by a factor of 1.4. Serum ferritin was also signif-
icantly associated with transplant survival (p = 0.02),
while the marrow iron stain showed a strong trend
towards statistical significance (p = 0.08). Though not sig-
nificant by quartile analysis, a bone marrow iron stain
score of +6 was significantly associated with increased
mortality (p = 0.04). The number of patients above the
cutoff for transfusion number, ferritin, and iron stain were
30, 41, and 7, respectively. The Transplant Iron Score,
when compared with individual and a combination of
iron parameters, was most closely associated with survival
(p = 0.0006). The risk of death nearly doubled with each
point increase of the Transplant Iron Score.
Trend analysis further supported that higher Transplant
Iron Scores were associated with decreased overall survival
(Figure 1A, p = 0.0003 by log-rank trend). The median
survival for patients with no evidence of iron overload
(score of 0) was estimated at over 6 years. Patients with
higher scores had lower median survival times: 2.4 years
for a score of 1; 6.5 months for a score of 2; and 8 days in
those patients with a score of 3. The 27 patients (35%)
with a high score had a substantially lower median sur-
vival of 5.0 months compared to 29.3 months in those
with a low score (Figure 1B). The unadjusted hazard ratio
associated with a high score was 2.60 (95% CI of 1.47 to
4.61). Our sample size did not allow us to perform rigor-
ous subgroup analyses by disease type, however we did
note that ALL (p = 0.02), AML (p = 0.06), and MDS (p =
0.004) patients with a high iron score exhibited a signifi-
cant decrease in survival. Iron overload also resulted in
decreased survival among aplastic anemia patients, how-
ever this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.35).
The increase in mortality associated with iron overload
resulted primarily from early deaths. In the first six
months following transplant, 56% of those with a high
iron score had died as compared to 22% among those
with a low score (Figure 1B). This equates to a 34% abso-
lute risk associated with transfusion related iron overload

The relative risk represents the relative risk of death associated with each incremental increase in quartile (e.g. 50th to 75th quartile) among the iron
parameters. The following cutoff values were used to assign patients to the various groupings: (1) serum ferritin ≥ 1,000 ng/mL, (2) greater than 25
transfused units of red cells, and (3) bone marrow iron stain of 6+. The Transplant Iron Score is calculated by assigning patients one point for each
of the values above the cutoff.
*The calculated relative risks were scaled (i.e. scored on a 0-3 scale) to allow comparisons to the individual iron quartiles.

within the first six months. Subsequently, mortality rates
were nearly identical between groups after the six-month
time point. The difference in early survival was primarily
due to an increased number of treatment related deaths (p
= 0.018) (Figure 2B). Meanwhile, iron overload was not
associated with a significant increase in relapse rate (p =
0.84) or disease related mortality (p = 0.40). The effect of
iron overload was most pronounced among the patients
undergoing allogeneic transplantation (p < 0.001) with a
50% absolute mortality difference at one year. Addition-
ally, of the 19 allogeneic transplant patients with a high
iron score, only two patients survived more than three
years after transplant.
We further examined the cause of death among the 20
patients that died as a result of treatment related compli-
cations. The majority of these patients (55%) had either
documented (5 patients) or suspected (6 patients) lethal
infection. Furthermore, the rate of infection related mor-
tality was disproportionately high among those with a
high iron score (26%) as compared to those with a low
score (8%) (p = 0.04 by Fisher's exact test). Clinical infor-
mation regarding the 7 patients with a high iron score
with infection-related mortality is detailed in Table 3.
Rates of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and veno-
occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver were statistically sim-
ilar between groups (p = 0.9 and p = 0.3 by Fisher's exact
test, respectively).
Multivariate analysis was used to establish whether the
Transplant Iron Score was independently associated with
transplant survival. Covariables included established pre-
dictors of transplant outcome, such as age, gender, donor-
type, and remission status. In addition to standard trans-

plant risk factors, an inflammatory marker (C-reactive
protein) was included along with measures of end-organ
damage (transaminase levels, INR, TB, and EF). Because
frank organ failure is not likely to be present in eligible
transplant patients, quartiles were used in the evaluation
of end-organ damage in an attempt to identify early organ
damage (i.e. mild transaminitis or a low-normal ejection
fraction). The Transplant Iron Score had a significant
independent effect on overall survival (p = 0.01) (Table
4). Among the subgroup of patients with AML, cytoge-
netic data (a marker for aggressive disease) did not influ-
ence the significance of this finding when added to the
multivariate model. Furthermore, the iron score was inde-
pendently associated with treatment related mortality (p =
0.04), infection related mortality (p = 0.02), and alloge-
neic transplant mortality (p = 0.03). When analyzing the
subgroup of allogeneic transplant patients, a statistically
significant difference in treatment related mortality (p =
0.01) and infection related mortality (p = 0.03) was main-
tained.
Discussion
Estimating systemic iron stores in stem cell transplant
patients is challenging. Serum ferritin has frequently been
used as an estimate of systemic iron stores, but is prone to
false elevation in the setting of inflammation and malig-
nancy [13]. Other blood markers, such as transferrin satu-
ration and soluble transferrin receptor, have proven to be
even less successful in establishing the diagnosis of iron
overload [14,15]. Non-invasive imaging techniques, such
as T2* MRI, show promise for determining tissue iron
stores but have not been extensively studied in transplant
patients [16]. The current "gold standard" for assessing
systemic iron overload remains dependent on liver biopsy
[17]. However, invasive procedures are often not practical
in patients awaiting stem cell transplant, as thrombocyto-
penia and neutropenia are common. Because of these dif-
ficulties, there is no consensus on how to best determine
iron status in the transplant setting [18].
We identified three clinical markers of iron overload that
were associated with decreased survival: (1) transfusion
burden, (2) serum ferritin, and (3) bone marrow iron

stores. Intuitively, each of these is a marker of transfusion
related iron overload, and all have been used separately to
estimate iron overload in transplant and non-transplant
studies [5,6,19]. Each marker we identified also has the
advantage of being readily available in the clinical setting,
as exemplified by the high availability within our study.
In comparison to individual iron parameters, the Trans-
plant Iron Score was more closely associated with trans-
plant outcomes. Specifically, the iron score was more
closely associated with survival than ferritin quartiles,
which have previously been used to estimate pre-trans-
plant iron overload [6]. Additionally, the iron score iden-
tified 35 percent of our study patients as having a "high"
score, whereas quartiles by definition only identify the
highest 25 percent. This suggests the Transplant Iron Score
may be simultaneously more accurate and more inclusive
than other proposed markers of iron overload in the
transplant setting. Further evidence of the potential power
of the iron score was seen in multivariate analysis, where
the iron score maintained significance while controlling
for other risk factors.
Using the Transplant Iron Score, we investigated the
mechanism by which iron overload influences transplant
survival. Classically, excess iron accumulates over decades
resulting in progressive heart and liver dysfunction and
eventually leading to premature death [1]. In contrast, our
results demonstrate that iron overload at the time of trans-
plant results in early mortality, and suggest that this proc-
ess is not dependent on end-organ damage. Also differing
from "classic" iron overload, our data suggests that a rela-
tively low systemic iron burden is sufficient to substan-
tially alter transplant survival. In adults, transfusion with
more than 100 units of blood is generally required prior
to clinical evidence of iron overload [20,21]. Meanwhile,
even our patients with a high iron score had only 46 units
of pRBCs on average. Taken together, our results suggest
that iron overload in the transplant setting influences
mortality by an alternate mechanism of action, differing
from the classic model of chronic free-radical induced
organ damage. Interestingly, the degree of iron overload
necessary to impact transplant survival appears to be sub-
clinical, underscoring the need for a more sensitive clini-
cal marker of iron such as the Transplant Iron Score.
To further explore the mechanism by which iron overload
influences survival, we closely examined the cause of
death for each of the transplant recipients. We observed
that treatment related mortality occurred more frequently
in those patients with a high iron score. The majority of
these deaths resulted from infection, thereby suggesting
that lethal infection is the dominant mechanism by which
iron overload influences transplant survival. While it has
been suggested that iron overload predisposes to infection
[4,5,22], to our knowledge, this is the first report showing
an independent association between iron overload and
infection related mortality.
In addition to adding insight into the mechanism of
action of transplant iron overload, our study also helps to
define its clinical applicability. Specifically, our study
simultaneously compares the impact of iron overload in
both the autologous and allogeneic transplant setting.
Using the Transplant Iron Score to define iron overload in
both groups, we found allogeneic transplant patients to
be at a disproportionately high risk of death associated
with iron overload. Our data suggests that iron overload
as a prognostic marker may be limited to, or at least more
pronounced in, patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell
transplant.
We acknowledge the limitations inherent in our small sin-
gle-institution study and believe that validation of the
Transplant Iron Score is necessary prior to its incorpora-
tion into clinical practice. Nevertheless, our results
strongly support the notion that iron overload prior to
transplant is detrimental and provide rationale to study
chelation therapy within the transplant setting. Typically,
there is only a small window of opportunity between
when a patient is identified as needing transplantation
and when the transplant is undertaken. If patients with
iron overload are detected early in this process, it is con-
ceivable that iron chelation could minimize the negative
impact of iron overload on transplant survival. This excit-
ing possibility merits study in a prospective randomized
