INTRODUCTION
Tuberculosis (TB) is the world’s second most common cause
of death from infectious disease, after HIV/AIDS. There were
an estimated 8.3 million new cases of TB in 2000 and 1.8
million deaths from TB were reported in the same year. More-
over, TB was the cause of 11% of all adult AIDS deaths (1).
TB can cause diverse laboratory abnormalities such as ane-
mia (2, 3), increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (4-6), low
serum albumin level (5, 7), hyponatremia (5), abnormal liver
function (5), leukocytosis (5), and hypocalcemia (7). A num-
ber of studies have documented anemia in patients with TB
(3, 5, 8-11), however, these studies involved only small num-
bers of patients and the results were not uniform. Moreover,
there has been no study on the evolution of TB-associated
anemia after establishment of short-term combination anti-
TB chemotherapy in the 1980s. In this context, we attempt-
ed to characterize TB-associated anemia by clarifying its pre-
valence, characteristics, and evolution with anti-TB treatment
involving large numbers of patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study settings and subjects
We included patients aged 15 yr or older who were diag-
nosed with TB and administered first-line anti-TB medica-
tions between June 2000 and May 2001 at Seoul National
University Hospital, a university-affiliated tertiary referral
hospital. The following cases were diagnosed with TB; pati-
ents with positive smear or culture, compatible pathology
result, positive TB PCR or lymphocyte dominant exudate
pleural effusion with high ADA, low CEA and negative cytol-
ogy. We excluded patients with any other medical conditions
that can cause anemia, such as bleeding, nutritional deficien-
cy, malignancy, AIDS, autoimmune disease, aplastic anemia,
chronic renal disease, chronic liver disease, and taking of medi-
cation that can cause anemia within four weeks. We also ex-
cluded patients who could not be followed up for more than
four weeks. In the analysis of anemia resolution, those patients
were excluded who took iron for more than one month dur-
ing anti-TB medication.
Definition of anemia, its resolution, and good clinical
response to the treatment
The definition of anemia used in this study was hemoglo-
bin concentration less than 13 g/dL in men and 12 g/dL in
women (WHO recommendation) (12). The resolution of an-
emia was defined as a hemoglobin concentration greater than
13 g/dL in men and 12 g/dL in women following two tests
more than a month apart. Good treatment response was de-
fined as negative conversion of sputa and no evidence of relapse

The Prevalence and Evolution of Anemia Associated with Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis (TB) may produce abnormalities in the peripheral blood, including ane-
mia. However, the evolution of TB-associated anemia with short-term combination
anti-TB chemotherapy has not been well elucidated. The aim of this study was to
characterize TB-associated anemia by clarifying its prevalence, characteristics, and
evolution, through involving large numbers of patients with TB. The medical records
of adult patients with TB diagnosed between June 2000 and May 2001 were reviewed.
Among 880 patients with TB, 281 (31.9%) had anemia on diagnosis of TB, however,
the hemoglobin concentration was less than 10 g/dL in only 45 patients (5.0%). Ane-
mia was more frequently associated with the female and old age. Good treatment
response, young age (≤≤65 yr-old) and initial high hemoglobin were the predictive
factor for resolution of anemia. In 202 patients with anemia (71.9%), anemia was
normocytic and normochromic. During or after anti-TB treatment, anemia was re-
solved in 175 (64.6%) out of 271 patients without iron intake. The mean duration
of resolution from the initiation of anti-TB treatment was 118.8±±113.2 days. In con-
clusion, anemia is a common hematological abnormality in patients with TB and
close observation is sufficient for patients with TB-associated anemia, because TB-
associated anemia is usually mild and resolves with anti-TB treatment.

after completion of treatment. Improvement of radiographic
or bronchoscopic findings was also defined as a good treat-
ment response if the result of a sputum study conducted sub-
sequent to treatment was not available.
Data collection and statistical analysis
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of the en-
rolled patients, which included demographic data, the type
of TB, the treatment regimen and duration, and the serial
hemoglobin concentration. Univariate comparisons between
patients with anemia and patients without anemia were per-
formed using Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and
the Student’s t test for continuous variables. All tests of sig-
nificance were two sided, and a p value of less than 0.05 was
considered significant. Multivariate logistic regression anal-
ysis was conducted using SPSS (version 11.0) to identify the
predictor variables for the development of anemia.
RESULTS
Clinical characteristics of enrolled patients
Among the 974 eligible patients, 94 were excluded from
the analysis because they had other medical conditions that
can cause anemia. The excluded patients were 42 with AIDS,
20 with malignant disease who were taking anti-cancer che-
motherapy, 12 with systemic lupus erythematosus, 14 with
liver cirrhosis, and six with other diseases. The clinical data
of the remaining 880 patients were analyzed.
Among the 880 patients, 472 patients (53.6%) were male
and 408 (46.4%) were female. The median age was 44 yr old
(range 15-93). Pulmonary TB was the most common form of
TB (596 patients, 67.7%). Treatment with isoniazid, rifam-
picin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol was applied to 615 pa-
tients (69.9%), and the median treatment period was 211
days (range 28-1,463 days) (Table 1).
Prevalence and characteristics of anemia
Anemia was identified in 281 patients (31.9%) at the time
of diagnosis of TB. 133 (28.2%) of men and 148 (36.3%) of
women with TB had anemia. In 45 patients, the hemoglobin
concentration was less than 10 g/dL. No male patient had a
hemoglobin concentration less than 8.0 g/dL and no female
patient had a hemoglobin concentration less than 7.0 g/dL
(Table 2). Normocytic and normochromic anemia was most
common, and was identified in 202 (71.9%) patients; and
microcytic hypochromic anemia was next common (26 patients,
9.1%) (Table 3). The presence of anemia was associated with
age older than 65 yr and female sex (Table 4).
Evolution of anemia with anti-TB treatment
10 patients with iron replacement during anti-TB medi-
cation were excluded for the analysis of evolution of anemia.
In 175 (64.6%) out of the other 271 patients with TB-asso-
ciated anemia, the anemia resolved during or after comple-
tion of anti-TB treatment. Mean duration from initiation of

treatment to resolution of anemia was 118.8±113.2 days.
Resolution of anemia took longer if the initial hemoglobin
concentration was lower. It took 232.3±179.1 days to res-
olution for patients whose hemoglobin concentrations were
less than 10 g/dL, 152.5±95.5 days for 10.0-10.9 g/dL,
117.8±99.0 days for 11.0-11.9 g/dL, and 71.6±73.8 days
for more than 12.0 g/dL (p=0.02).
Among the other 96 patients with persistent anemia, the
hemoglobin concentration increased more than 1 g/dL in 25
patients and was stationary within 1 g/dL from the initial
level in the other 71 patients. There were no patients in whom
the hemoglobin concentration decreased by more than 1 g/dL.
In 63 of the 71 patients with stable hemoglobin levels, the
initial hemoglobin concentration was greater than 11.0 g/dL.
Seven of the remaining eight patients with persistent anemia,
whose hemoglobin concentration was less than 11.0 g/dL, had
a poor performance status; poor oral intake, severe parkinson-
ism, old age (85 yr old), or were bedridden. The remaining
patient had endometrial polyps with menorrhagia (Fig. 1).
Good treatment response, young age, and initial higher
hemoglobin concentration were related with resolution of
anemia. In multivariate analysis including these three vari-
ables, initial higher hemoglobin was the only predictive fac-
tor for resolution of anemia although younger age and good
treatment response showed marginal association (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
Anemia has been reported in 16% to 94% in patients with
pulmonary TB, (3, 5, 6, 8-11) although a different definition
was applied. These reports recommend TB as one of the dif-
ferential diagnoses of anemia. Anemia occurred in 31.9% of
our patients, but it had a benign course in most cases. TB-
associated anemia completely resolved with anti-TB treat-
ment in 64.5% of patients. In addition, the anemia improved
considerably in the other patients, with rare exceptions.
All chronic infections including TB can cause anemia (13).
Various pathogeneses have been suggested in TB-associated
anemia, but most studies have shown suppression of erythro-
poiesis by inflammatory mediators (2, 3, 5, 14, 15) as a cause
of anemia. Nutritional deficiency (16) and malabsorption syn-
drome (17) can deepen the severity of anemia. However, the
observation that patients with TB-associated anemia display
an absence of bone marrow iron (8, 11) and the same red blood

cell distribution width as that observed with iron-deficiency
anemia (2), suggests that iron-deficiency is a possible cause
of anemia in patients with TB.
Although a normocytic, normochromic anemia was most
common in this study, other types of anemia, including hypo-
chromic microcytic anemia, were not rare. Considering the
diverse morphology of anemia and various suggestions for
the cause of TB-associated anemia, the anemia in patients
with TB may result from several mechanisms instead of one
sole pathogenesis. In addition, that the anemia did not resolve
completely, even after successful treatment in 81 patients with
TB-associated anemia, suggests that anemia of other causes
could have combined with TB-associated anemia.
Female sex and old age were risk factors for TB-associated
anemia in our data. The prevalence of anemia usually increases
with age (18), especially after age 60 yr (19-22). The increas-
ing prevalence of anemia with age has been explained by in-
creased chronic disease, poor nutritional status, decreased mar-
row cellularity (23), and low serum vitamin B12 levels (24).
In this context, old age could be interpreted as a risk factor
for TB-associated anemia. On the other hand, a disturbance
of iron homeostasis develops with increased uptake and reten-
tion of iron within the reticuloendothelial system in chronic
infections such as TB (15, 25, 26). Because iron is important
growth factor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the iron retention
to reticuloendothelial system is considered one of host
defense mechanisms and many therapeutic trials are perform-
ed (27). The effect of iron-retention might be exaggerated
in women with TB because women are more likely than men
to be iron deficient (28). This can explain female sex is the
risk factor of anemia.
Iron retention, erythropoietin response (29), nutritional
state, and malabsorption can improve, as inflammation and
burden of organism decreases by anti-TB medication. This
can explain good treatment response showed tendency toward
resolution of anemia with marginal statistical significance
in our study (OR=2.17, 95% CI 0.96-5.12, p=0.06). The
report association between the resolution of anemia and neg-
ative sputum conversion in pulmonary TB could be appre-
ciated in this context (30).
In conclusion, anemia is a common hematological abnor-
mality in patients with TB. Because TB-associated anemia
is usually mild and resolves with anti-TB treatment, close
observation is sufficient without other cause of the anemia.
