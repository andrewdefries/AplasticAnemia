Retrospective survey for sialidase activity in
Mycoplasma pneumoniae isolates from cases
of community-acquired pneumonia

Abstract
Background: Sialidase is a well-known virulence factor of other respiratory pathogens, but was only recently
documented to occur in some species of Mycoplasma. The sialidase activity expressed can vary quantitatively
among strains within a species of mycoplasma, from undetectable to amounts that correlate positively with strain
virulence. Very few isolates of Mycoplasma pneumoniae had ever been examined for sialidase activity, so it was
unknown whether sialidase may contribute to diseases involving this species.
Findings: No sialidase activity was detected by spectrofluorometric assay of 15 laboratory strains and 91 clinical
isolates of M. pneumoniae banked over many years from patients having radiologically-confirmed, uncomplicated
community-acquired pneumonia.
Conclusions: The annotated genome of strain M129 (GenBank NC_000912, ATCC 29342), also isolated from a
patient with pneumonia, accurately represents the absence of sialidase genes from strains of M. pneumoniae
typically associated with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia. A possible involvement of sialidase in
neurologic or other extra-respiratory manifestations of M. pneumoniae mycoplasmosis remains to be investigated.
Findings
Research objective
Mycoplasma pneumoniae is primarily associated with
interstitial pneumonitis, tracheobronchitis, desquamative
bronchitis and pharyngitis, collectively referred to as pri-
mary atypical pneumonia (PAP) [1,2]. Mycoplasmosis
accounts for 20 - 30% of community-acquired pneumo-
nia (CAP) cases, constituting significant disease and eco-
nomic burdens in North America and Western Europe.
Following its initial association with PAP, other diseases
involving M. pneumoniae invasion of non-respiratory
tissues were reported [Table 1]. Neurologic, dermal,
hemotropic, cardiac, arthritic, hepatic, pancreatic,
nephritic, and musculoskeletal pathologies have been
described[2-12]; many of those diseases occurred secon-
darily to PAP, either through dissemination of M. pneu-
moniae from the respiratory tract, or following
associated autoimmune disorders [3]. Primary extra-
respiratory M. pneumoniae infections in the absence of
PAP, including meningoencephalitis, hepatitis, and
pancreatitis, have also been described [13,14], and
M. pneumoniae has been isolated from the urogenital
tract in the absence of clinical signs.
The majority of studies on clinical aspects of M. pneu-
moniae mycoplasmosis address the diagnosis, treatment
and prevention of CAP, while factors predisposing to
extra-respiratory diseases remain virtually unexplored.
Extracellular “spreading factors” like sialidase are well-
known virulence determinants of other pathogenic
microorganisms, and are targets for chemotherapy in
diseases such as influenza. Sialidase is associated with
systemic dissemination during infection with many bac-
terial species, most notably Streptococcus pneumoniae
and Clostridium perfringens, but such glycosidases were
only recently documented to occur in certain species of
Mycoplasma. The sialidase activity expressed by myco-
plasmas can vary significantly among strains within a
species, from undetectable to amounts that correlate
positively with strain virulence. Very few isolates of

M. pneumoniae have been examined for sialidase activ-
ity, so it was unknown whether sialidase may contribute
either to PAP or to extra-respiratory diseases involving
this species. To establish the baseline frequency of its
occurrance in M. pneumoniae, we conducted a retro-
spective survey for sialidase activity in clinical isolates
associated with respiratory mycoplasmosis.
Methods
Fifteen laboratory strains of M. pneumoniae, including
the well-known virulent strain PI1428 (American Type
Culture Collection accession number 29085, from a
patient with PAP), SAD03, SAD05, TW11-4, 1RCH,
9RCH, 11-61, 104.2, 142-48, 256-8, 541-6, 541-29, 1161,
1311 and 15531, plus 91 clinical isolates from cases of
radiologically-confirmed interstitial pneumonia were
tested. The de-identified clinical isolates had been
banked over a period of many years from patients diag-
nosed with CAP at various locations in the US. They
were isolated from four distinct sites in the respiratory
tract: 61 were from throat swabs, 4 from nasal swabs, 17
from sputum, and 9 from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
The latter were considered by clinicians to be invasive
because they were from patients hospitalized with severe
pneumonia. It was unknown whether any of the patients
had been diagnosed as having pneumonia attributable
solely to M. pneumoniae, or had been treated empiri-
cally with viral neuraminidase inhibitors.
Frozen stocks of mycoplasma were passaged one time
in SP-4 medium supplemented with 10% w/v glucose
and 15% v/v fetal bovine serum at 37°C in ambient air.
Sialidase activity of M. pneumoniae cells suspended in
conditioned medium was assessed using the fluorogenic
substrate 2’-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-a-D-N-acetylneura-
minic acid (MUAN) as previously described [15]. Briefly,
50 μl of stationary phase cultures were added to 50 μl
of 0.35% w/v MUAN in 30 mM sodium acetate buffer,
pH 4.5. Following 60 min incubation at room tempera-
ture, fluorescence at 450 nm was quantitated using a
spectrofluorometer (excitation at 350 nm; cutoff filter at
420 nm). The positive controls were Mycoplasma alliga-
toris strain A21JP2T
, which expresses a cell-associated
sialidase [16], and Type VI sialidase purified from Clos-
tridium perfringens. The negative controls were Myco-
plasma crocodyli strain MP145T
, which does not express
any sialidase, and fresh culture medium.
Results
No sialidase activity was detected in any specimen, thus
there was no evidence that the enzyme contributes to
PAP involving M. pneumoniae. However, the undocu-
mented clinical significance of M. pneumoniae isolation
from these patients is a recognized weakness of this
study. It seems unlikely that potential empiric treatment
with viral neuraminidase inhibitors strictly precluded
isolation of sialidase-positive strains of M. pneumoniae

The primary disease state generated by M. pneumoniae infection is PAP, although many additional clinical manifestations have been reported [2].
Mycoplasmosis due to M. pneumoniae affects numerous organ systems by generating primary lesions in non-respiratory tissues or secondary lesions following
presumed hematogenous spread from the respiratory tract, or by contributing to autoimmune-related disorders. Differences in bacterial or host phenotypes that
explain the diverse clinical outcomes remain essentially unknown.

from any of these patients, but this remains to be defini-
tively established.
The ability of certain M. pneumoniae strains to cause
extra-respiratory mycoplasmosis may require additional
cellular functions, which can be genetically acquired in
vivo from the polymicrobial community within the
human host. The presence of bacterial spreading factors
such as sialidase might explain the differences in clinical
manifestations of infection with certain strains of M.
pneumoniae. Sialidase is a prominent candidate for this
because of its well-documented tendency to be horizon-
tally transferred among bacteria [17]. In addition, quan-
titative variation of sialidase activity among strains of
other pathogenic mycoplasmas ranges from undetectable
to extremely high in significant correlation with strain
invasiveness [18]. A possible involvement of sialidase in
neurologic or other manifestations of invasive disease
remains to be investigated, but a bank of those less
common specimens will be required to determine
whether PAP-associated strains are less likely to express
sialidase activity than strains associated with other out-
comes of M. pneumoniae mycoplasmosis. We conclude
that the annotated genome of the well-known virulent
strain M129 (GenBank accession number NC_000912),
also isolated from a patient with pneumonia (American
Type Culture Collection accession number 29342), accu-
rately represents the absence of sialidase genes from
strains of M. pneumoniae typically associated with
uncomplicated PAP.
