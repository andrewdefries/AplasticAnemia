Infantile spasm is an age-related refractory epilepsy. Topira-
mate is a new anticonvulsant with multiple mechanisms of
action, and it may be effective for treating pediatric epilepsies.
To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of first-line topiramate
treatment for infantile spasm, 20 patients received topiramate
monotherapy during this study. They were treated with an
initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day, with a progressive titration of 1
mg/kg a week until their spasms were controlled and a maxi-
mum dose of 12 mg/kg/day was achieved. The evaluation of
the treatment efficacy was based on the spasm frequency data
that was obtained by the scalp and video-EEG, and by the
parental count of spasm. Thirty percent of the subjects became
spasm-free during the study. Six of 20 subjects (30%) had
cessation of spasm and disappearance of hypsarrhythmia as
seen via the video EEG; four (50%) of eight idiopathic patients
had a response, whereas two (17%) of 12 patients with symp-
tomatic infantile spasm responded. Seventy of the patients,
including the spasm-free patients, had a reduction in their
seizure frequency of more than 50%, and 10% of the patients
had a reduction in their seizure frequency of less than 50%.
The clusters of spasm frequency decreased from 10.6 ± 8.5 to
3.5 ± 1.4 clusters/day. Topiramate is effective and tolerated in
those patients suffering from infantile spasm. Our results
suggest that this drug should be considered as a new first-line
drug for treating infantile spasm.

INTRODUCTION
Infantile spasm is a catastrophic childhood
epilepsy syndrome1
that was first described by
West in 1841.2
The combination of infantile spasm,
a characteristic electroencephalographic pattern
and psychomotor retardation in the majority of
patients is known as West Syndrome.
3
For the management of infantile spasm, ACTH/
steroid or vigabatrin (VGB) are widely and fre-
quently as the first-line of treatment.4,5
Because the
usefulness of these drugs is limited by the occur-
rence of side effects, scientists are searching for
new antiepileptic drugs to treat infantile spasm.6-12
Topiramate (TPM) is a drug with multiple
mechanisms of action, including the state-depen-
dent inhibition of sodium channels, the potentia-
tion of -aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced chloγ -
ride influx, the blockade of glutamate related
excitatory neurotransmission, and the inhibition
of carbonic anhydrase.
13
TMP has been used as a
monotherapy and adjunctive treatment of partial-
onset and generalized tonic-clonic seizure in
adults,14,15
and for partial seizures in children.16
Additionally, TPM is effective when used as ad-
junctive therapy for the management of Lennox-
Gastaut Syndrome.
17
Previous studies have suggested that TPM is
effective for the treatment of infantile spasm
when it is used as an add-on therapy.18
Although
a pilot study attempted to evaluate TPM as a
monotherapy for infantile spasm,
19
there remains
a need for a more effective first-line treatment
with reduced adverse effects. The aim of this
study was to assess the effectiveness and tolera-
bility of TPM when used as the initial treatment
for patients with newly diagnosed infantile
spasm.

tile spasm were treated with TPM between

Topiramate Monotherapy in Infantile Spasm
Yonsei Med J Vol. 47, No. 4, 2006
January 2001 and December 2003. This study in-
cluded 17 male and 3 female subjects between 3
and 24 months of age. Subjects were exhibited an
average of more than one cluster of spasms per
day over one month before the start of TPM
therapy to establish seizure frequency.
The following criteria were used to establish
the diagnosis of infantile spasm: (1) seizures
were characterized by axial muscle flexion, exten-
sion, or mixed spasms. (2) electroencephalo-
graphic findings demonstrated hypsarrhythmia,
modified hypsarrhythmia, or multifocal spike-
wave discharges.
To ensure that we obtained the informed con-
sent of the patients' families, we provided them
with detailed information about the standard
treatment options available for infantile spasm.
We also provided the families with information
on the efficacy and potential side effects of TPM.
Additionally, we educated them about their
children's spasms and asked them to maintain
daily diaries to document the occurrences of the
spasms. Efficacy evaluation was based on cluster
frequency data obtained from using 24-hour
video electroencephalogram (EEG), scalp EEG,
and from analyzing the daily diary of the
children's seizure occurrence. EEG recordings
were performed upon entry into this study and
absence of clusters of spasm at that time, or at
the end of the trial. TPM was given at an initial
dose of 1 mg/kg per day, with a progressive
titration of 1 mg/kg a week until spasms were
controlled, the maximal tolerated dose was
reached, or the maximal dose of 12 mg/kg per
day was achieved. At 12 weeks after the initia-
tion of TPM monotherapy, we analyzed all
patients to measure the effectiveness and toler-
ability of TPM. Evaluation of effects was based
on frequency of the cluster of spasms, with
response defined as cessation of spasms and
disappearance of the hypsarrhythmic EEG pat-
tern. Adverse effects were monitored and
recorded. We obtained blood and urine samples
for routine laboratory examination following the
study period. The routine laboratory examination
included complete blood cell and platelet counts,
electrolyte analysis, urinalysis, and assays for
liver and renal function. Statistical evaluation
was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. A
p values < 0.05 was considered statistically sig-
nificant.
RESULTS
Characteristics of patients
The median age for infantile spasm onset was
6.5 months (range, 3 to 24 months), and the me-
dian follow-up duration of spasms after starting
TPM monotherapy was 15.7 months (range, 4 to
30 months). Flexor spasms were the most com-
ment type of spasm (Table 1).
Etiologies of infantile spasm
Regarding the etiologic factor, eight (40%)
patients had cryptogenic epilepsy. Among the
twelve (60%) symptomatic cases, hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy (HIE) was the most common
underlying etiologic factor, followed by central
nervous system anomaly (Table 2).

Outcomes
Overall, six (30%) patients became spasm-free
for an average of 51 ± 24 days (range, 22 to 87
days) at TPM doses ranging from 4 mg/kg to 12
mg/kg per day. The mean dose of TPM during
stabilization was 9.1 ± 3.1 mg/kg per day. Spasm
frequency decreased 67% from the baseline to the
stabilization phase (Table 3). Seventy percent of
the patients who received TPM, including the six
spasm-free, achieved a 50% reduction in spasm
frequency compared to baseline (Table 3). Mainte-
nance doses ranged between 9 and 12 mg/kg per
day. One patient titrating 5 mg/kg per day had an
increase in spasm frequency. Overall, 6 of 20
patients became free of spasms and hypsarrhy-
thmia. Four (20%) of eight cryptogenic infantile
spasm patients became spasm free, whereas 2
(10%) of 12 symptomatic patients responded. TPM
appeared to be more effective with cryptogenic
than symptomatic epilepsy (Table 4). Of the six
responders, however, there was one (17%) had a
relapse of spasms within four weeks. The four
patients with normalized EEGs remained spasm-
free, while one infant continued to have an ab-
normal EEG pattern with persisting focal spike
discharges, though without relapse of spasms.
Adverse events
Five (25%) patients displayed adverse effects
during titration or stabilization or both. Adverse
effects included sleep disturbance, irritability,
lethargy, rash, and oligohidrosis (Table 5). We ob-
served one case of oligohidrosis in a 6-month-old
female treated with TPM. At that time, one month
after TPM introduction, the TPM dose was titrated
to 4 mg/kg per day. TPM was gradually tapered,

DISCUSSION
Infantile spasm is a catastrophic childhood
epilepsy syndrome1
that is characterized by flexor
or extensor spasm, hypsarrhythmia and psycho-
motor regression. Despite the use of a variety of
therapies for infantile spasm, complete seizure
control is difficult to achieve and the optimal
treatment remains uncertain at best. The efficacy
of the various drugs used in the treatment of
infantile spasm is often difficult to determine
because of the short follow-up periods of the
studies and the lack of data on the long-term
effects.
Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) was
first reported in the 1950s to have rapid effects on
spasms.
20
For approximately 50 years, ACTH has
been widely used as the drug of choice for the
treatment of infantile spasm.4
ACTH induces a
reduction or cessation of spasms and the disap-
pearance of hypsarrhythmia on the EEG in
approximately 50-75% of patients.
21-23
Despite its
efficacy, ACTH has been associated with side
effects, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
hypertension, infection, and electrolyte distur-
bance.
6-10
Furthermore, the relapse rate ranges
from 32% to 87% during corticotropin therapy.24
Although valproate and the benzodiazepines
have therapeutic effects, conventional antiepileptic
drugs are usually ineffective in reducing seizure
activity.25-27
Furthermore, adverse effects on the
fetus, including irreversible hepatotoxicity, have
been associated with the use of valproate.
28
Benzo-
diazepines usually require additional medications,
the use of which can cause defective swallowing
and a tendency for aspiration with higher doses.29
Thus, there is a need for a more effective first
choice drug with reduced side-effect. Because of
recent advances in the understanding of the basic
neuropathology, neuropharmacology, and neuro-
physiology of epilepsy, several new antiepileptic
drugs have been developed and use in therapeutic
trials.
Since vigabatrin (VGB) was first reported as an
add-on therapy for resistant infantile spasm in
1991,30
it has been considered as another drug to
use as first-line therapy for infantile spasm in
many countries outside the United States.5,31
In an
open-label study of VGB as a first-line treatment
for infantile spasm, 26% of the subjects became
spasm free.32
Another study showed that 64% of
the subjects had a clinical response that included
the complete cessation of spasms.33
In our study,
as in the above earlier studies, TPM has shown a
similar reduction of spasm response rates (30% of
the subjects became spasm-free, and 40% of the
subjects experienced more than a 50% reduction
of spasm) as compared with VGB. Several reports
have demonstrated that VGB has excellent
efficacy, with complete control occurring in about
95% to 100% of the patients with infantile spasm
due to tuberous sclerosis.34,35
However, recent
reports of visual field defects associated with VGB
treatment may limit its utility.
11,12,36
Some open-label trials on instituting mono-
therapy or adjunctive therapy with the new antie-
pileptic drugs, including lamotrigine (LTG),
37
felbamate,38
levetiracetam,39
zonisamide (ZNS),40
and topiramate,
19
have reported preliminary evi-
dence for the efficacy of these drugs in treating
infantile spasm. However, there are only limited
reports on using LTG, felbamate and levetirace-
tam in patients with infantile spasm. LTG was
reported to be effective as an add-on therapy for
30 patients with infantile spasm who were
resistant to several other drugs.41
However, this
condition may progress to the potentially life-
threatening Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic
epidermal necrolysis.
42
Because of this possibility,
one recent report suggested the effectiveness of
using low-dose LTG in 3 patients.43
Felbamate
may be effective for infantile spasms, as a re-
sponse was noted in three of four patients. Yet
after reports of aplastic anemia
44
and hepatotoxi-
city,45
the use of felbamate as a treatment option
for infantile spasm may be limited. One case
report described the successful use of levetirace-
tam therapy in an 11-month-old infant with infan-
tile spasms. The dose was gradually increased to
15 mg/kg/day up to a dosage of 60 mg/kg per
day.39
ZNS has been used in Japan since 1989, and
several reports have suggested that ZNS can be
Young-Se Kwon, et al.
Yonsei Med J Vol. 47, No. 4, 2006
effective as the initial treatment for infantile
spasm.40,46,47
However, there is only limited pub-
lished data concerning the use of ZNS for infants
with infantile spasm.
The data on using TPM as a potential first-line
therapy for infantile spasm are relatively scarce.
Glauser et al. first reported that TPM might be
effective as a first-line therapy for infantile
spasm.19
The dose titration schedule of that study
was 2-4 times faster, it was rapidly titrated over
four weeks, and it was increased up to a dosage
of 24 mg/kg per day, a greater dose increase than
in previous pediatric TPM studies.16,48,49
In those
studies, the mean dose of TPM during stabiliza-
tion was 15.0 ± 5.7 mg/kg per day. These studies
showed that 45% of patients became spasm free
and 9 of 11 patients experienced a 50% reduc-
tion in spasm frequency. The slow dose titration
of TPM allowed assessment of the patients' re-
sponses and increased patient tolerability to the
drug.50
The dose range of TPM is 1.2-12 mg/kg
once or twice daily, and a slow titration of 0.5-2
mg/kg/day every 2 weeks was well tolerated and
resulted in only mild to moderate adverse
effects.51
In our study, TPM was initiated at 1 mg/
kg per day and it was slowly titrated over 12
weeks up to a dosage of 12 mg/kg per day. Our
results showed that the mean dose of TPM during
stabilization was 9.1 ± 3.1 mg/kg per day, and
70% of the subjects achieved a 50% reduction
in spasm frequency, including six patients who
became spasm-free. These results suggested that
the maximal therapeutic dose and mean dose of
stabilization are lower than those reported by
previous studies. Despite these differences, there
were no differences in the observed effects of TPM
between the reports.
Although several reports displayed findings
contrary to the current textbook findings, patients
with cryptogenic infantile spasm responded better
to TPM than did the symptomatic patients.46,52
Our data is similar to above the textbook features.
Four of eight cryptogenic patients (50%) had a
normalized EEG and were spasm-free, whereas
only 2 of 12 symptomatic patients (17%) responded.
The observed efficacy of TPM in our study is
similar that observed for VGB in cryptogenic and
symptomatic patients (62% and 29%, respectively).5
The reported side effects of TPM include central
nervous system problems,53
behavioral and cogni-
tive problems,
53
gastrointestinal effects,
54
weight
loss,55
acute angle-closure glaucoma,56
oligohy-
drosis57
and kidney stones.58
Although five
patients in this study manifested adverse effects,
they were mild to moderate in severity. The side
effect profile mainly involved the central nervous
system, and these problems were generally short-
lived. None of the patients in our study developed
weight loss, acute angle-closure glaucoma, or
kidney stones.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that TPM
might be both effective and well tolerated as a
first-line therapy for infantile spasm. We believe
that slow dose titration and a low maximal dose
of TPM should be considered when starting
monotherapy in patients with infantile spasm. Yet
further studies involving a larger numbers of
patients are warranted and will be required to
determine the long-term outcome of the TPM
responders.
