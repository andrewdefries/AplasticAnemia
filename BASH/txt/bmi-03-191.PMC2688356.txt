Abstract: Benzene is used as a general purpose solvent. Benzene metabolism starts from phenol and ends with
p-benzoquinone and o-benzoquinone. Liver injury inducted by benzene still remains a toxicologic problem. Tumor related
genes and immune responsive genes have been studied in patients suffering from benzene exposure. However, gene
expression proﬁles and pathways related to its hepatotoxicity are not known. This study reports the results obtained in
the liver of BALB/C mice (SLC, Inc., Japan) administered 0.05 ml/100 g body weight of 2% benzene for six days. Serum,
ALT, AST and ALP were determined using automated analyzer (Fuji., Japan). Histopathological observations were made
to support gene expression data. c-DNA microarray analyses were performed using Affymetrix Gene-chip system. After
six days of benzene exposure, twenty ﬁve genes were down regulated whereas nineteen genes were up-regulated. These
gene expression changes were found to be related to pathways of biotransformation, detoxiﬁcation, apoptosis, oxidative
stress and cell cycle. It has been shown for the ﬁrst time that genes corresponding to circadian rhythms are affected by
benzene. Results suggest that gene expression proﬁle might serve as potential biomarkers of hepatotoxicity during benzene
exposure.

Introduction
Benzene is widely used as a general purpose industrial solvent. However, it is now used principally
in the synthesis of other chemicals. Its toxic effects on the blood and bone marrow include leuco-
penia, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia and leukemia (Snyder, 2002). Several studies on benzene
have focused on its metabolic pathways to determine its hematotoxicity and leukemogenicity
(Henderson, 1996; Snyder and Hedli, 1996). Metabolism of benzene to reactive metabolites by
hepatic enzymes mainly cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) is a prerequisite to its cyto and genotoxic-
ity (Gut et al. 1996; Valentine et al. 1996). Primary benzene metabolites include phenol, hydro-
quinone, catechol and trans trans muconic acid (Ross, 2000). They interact synergistically and
further exacerbate benzene toxicity (Chen and Eastmond, 1995). This mechanism of multime-
tabolite genotoxicity is another unique aspect of benzene that distinguishes it from other chemicals
in terms of mechanism of its toxicity. Subsequent secondary activation of its metabolites by myelo-
peroxidase (MPO) present in bone marrow results in the production of genotoxic quinines and
reactive oxygen species. They induce hemopoetic cellular damage and dysfunction of bone marrow
stromal cells (Farris et al. 1997). Despite intensive studies over several decades, mechanisms
underlying benzene induced toxicity and leukemogenicity are not yet fully understood. They are
complicated by various pathways including those of metabolism (Snyder and Hedli, 1996), growth
factor regulation (Niculescu, 1995), oxidative stress (Laskin et al. 1996), DNA damage (Lee and
Garner, 1991), cell cycle regulation (Yoon et al. 2001b) and programmed cell death (Ross et al.
1996). To elucidate molecular mechanisms of its toxicity, cDNA microarray analyses have been
performed by several workers. Yoon et al. (2003) performed cDNA microarray analysis to study
the mechanisms of benzene induced hematotoxicity in bone marrow of mouse. Effects of oral
exposure to benzene on gene expression in rat liver were reported by Heijne et al. (2005). Gene
expression changes were attributed to pathways of biotransformation viz. glutathione synthesis,
fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism. Kim et al. (2005) suggested that hydroquinone at least in
192

part, may enhance allergic immune responses of
benzene by inhibiting the production of IL-12
in macrophages. Microarray analysis of periph-
eral blood of benzene exposed workers was
performed by Forrest et al. (2005). They showed
that the altered expression of CXCL16, ZNF331,
JUN and PF4 as potential biomarkers of benzene
exposure. Tumor related (Xia et al. 2005) and
immune responsive genes (Wang et al. 2005)
have also been recorded in patients suffering
from benzene poisoning.
Since global gene expression studies are now
being increasingly used in toxicology (Waters,
et al. 2003), we hypothesized that microarrays
could identify changes in gene expression in the
liver that could be used as new biomarkers of
exposure, identify early effects and provide
information on mechanism of benzene toxicity. In
this study we investigated the changes in gene
expression induced by 24 hrs and six days of
exposure to benzene in the liver of mice to probe
further molecular mechanisms of benzene toxicity.
The overall objective of the study is to identify
potential molecular markers of early effects of
benzene in liver.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Benzene was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(U.S.A.). Trizol was purchased from Invitrogen
(U.S.A.). RNA isolation kit was procured from
Qiagen (Germany).
Animals and treatments
Approximately 9-week old, male BALB/c mice
(SLC, Inc., Japan) were kept in a 12 h light/dark
cycle under controlled temperature and humidity
for 2 weeks in the animal room prior to the exper-
iment. The mice were offered standard food pellets
and water ad libitum. Their body weight averaged
from 24 to 27 g (mean ± S.D. –25.75 ± 0.97).
Pure benzene (99%) was diluted by corn oil so
as to make a 2% (v/v) solution of benzene in corn
oil. 0.05 ml of diluted benzene/100 g body weight
was intraperitoneally injected to mice. 5 benzene
treated mice were sacriﬁced after 24 h of benzene
treatment. While 5 were sacriﬁced after 6 days of
benzene treatment. Parallel controls were also
sacriﬁced simultaneously.
Biochemical analysis
Blood was collected from the inferior vena cava.
Serum was separated by centrifugation. Serum
activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspar-
tate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phospha-
tase (ALP) were determined using automated
Clinical Chemistry Analyzer (Fuji Dri-Chem
3500s, Fujiﬁlm Co., Japan) at each time point. Data
was statistically calculated and signiﬁcance differ-
ence between treated and control groups was tested
using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) fol-
lowed by the Dunnett test. P values less than 0.05
were considered to be signiﬁcant.
Histopathology
Small pieces of liver collected from the mid liver
lobe of all treated and control mice were ﬁxed in
10% neutral buffered formalin, dehydrated in
alcohol, cleared in xylene and embedded in paraf-
fin. Four microns thick paraffin sections thus
prepared using rotary microtome (2165, Leica,
Germany) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin
and examined under light microscope (E400,
Nikon, Japan).
Isolation of RNA
Liver samples were homogenized with 2 mlTrizol®
(Invitrogen, U.S.A.) and mixed with 0.4 ml chlo-
roform. Following centrifugation, aqueous phase
was collected and mixed with isopropanol for pre-
cipitation. RNAprecipitate was washed by ethanol.
Isolated total RNAwas puriﬁed using RNeasy mini
kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufac-
turer’s protocol. The total RNA was quantiﬁed
using NanoDrop®
ND-1000 (NanoDrop, U.S.A.)
and RNA integrity was determined by Agilent
Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agient Technologies, U.S.A.).
Microarray analysis
Affymetrix GeneChip®
Mouse 430A 2.0 contain-
ing over 22,600 probe sets was used for microarray
experiment. Double-stranded cDNA was synthe-
sized from 5 ug of template total RNA using One-
Cycle cDNA Synthesis kit (Affymetrix, U.S.A.),
and biotin labeled cRNA was synthesized using
IVT Labeling kit (Affymetrix, U.S.A.). The
labeled cRNA was purified with GeneChip®
Sample Cleanup Module (Affymetrix, U.S.A.).
The quality and quantity of the cRNAwas checked
by conducting gel electrophoresis and NanoDrop®
193

ND-1000 (NanoDrop, U.S.A.), respectively. Fifteen
micrograms of the puriﬁed cRNA of each sample
was fragmented and hybridized to arrays for 16 h
at 45 °C.All arrays were washed and stained auto-
matically by using a fluidics Station 450
(Affymetrix, U.S.A.) and scanned by GeneChip®
scanner 3000 (Affymetrix, Inc, U.S.A.). All pro-
cedures were performed according to the manufac-
turer’s protocols (Affymetrix, U.S.A.). Image
processing was performed using Affymetrix
GeneChip®
Operating System (GCOS).
Gene expression analysis
The preprocessing procedure of resultant cell
intensity files (CEL) and following statistical
analysis were performed using GenePlex software
version 2.3 (ISTECH Inc., Korea). Microarray data
was globally normalized and used for further
analysis. Total 22,600 probe sets representing over
14,000 mouse genes were applied to gene expres-
sion analysis as well as hierarchical clustering. The
differentially expressed genes were selected at a
minimum 2-fold change after 1 day and 6 days of
benzene treatment compared with the control
group. Data were statistically analyzed by Student’s
t-test and P-values Ͻ0.01 were considered as
statistically signiﬁcant. The selected genes were
ﬁltered by extension GCOS ﬁltering (reference
M1). In addition, the differentially expressed genes
at 6 days treatment group compared with 1day
treatment group were also selected considering the
same criteria (Ն2-fold, P Ͻ 0.01). All selected
genes were analyzed by two-dimensional hierarchi-
cal clustering based on Pearson correlation and
Complete Linkage (Eisen, 1998). Discrepancies
among control, 1 day, and 6 days group were visu-
alized by Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
The classiﬁcation of pathway for interesting genes
was performed using KEGG pathway database.
The selected genes were annotated based on
NetAffx, linked at http://www.affymetrix.com.
Results
Blood biochemistry
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) values increased signiﬁ-
cantly after 24 hours of benzene treatment. How-
ever, on treatment for 6 days, a signiﬁcant decline
in their activity was recorded. Activity of serum
alkaline phosphatase also increased after 24 hours
but declined after six days of benzene treatment
(Fig. 1).
Liver histopathology
Hepatocytes near the centrilobular regions of the
lobule were compared in all the three groups. No
significant histopathological changes were
observed in the liver of mice treated with benzene
for 6 days. However, hypertrophic lesions were
recorded at a few places (Fig. 4). However, micro-
balooning in the hepatocytes was observed in the
liver of mice after 24 hr of benzene treatment.
Large necrotic spaces were wanting (Fig. 3). No
pathological lesions were observed in the liver of
control mice (Fig. 2).
Gene expression proﬁle
Microarray analysis was carried out to determine
differences in hepatic gene expression between
benzene and vehicle (corn oil) treated mice. RNA
integrity was intact (data not shown). Individual
liver samples from treated animals were analysed.
Array based observations were made in triplicate.
Gene expression was analyzed only in animals
treated with benzene for 24 hours and 6 days.
A total of 136 reliable genes were ﬁltered from
22600 probe sets by standard deviation of control
strength after per spot and per chip normalization.
Genes were sorted according to Student’s “t” test
(P values from 0 to Ͻ0.05). Forty four genes were

selected based on the fold difference in at least three
of nine conditions using ANOVA. A summary of
these analyses is presented in table 1. Table 2 lists
genes that changed signiﬁcantly (p Ͻ 0.05→0.01)
in mice liver treated with benzene for six consecu-
tive days. Results exhibiting time dependent
changes in the expression of genes corresponding
to control mice are explained in Figure 5.
Hierarchical clustering of the genes and dura-
tion of treatment with benzene also revealed time
dependent differences in gene expression (Fig. 5).
Figure 6 exhibits principal component analysis
showing gene expression changes.
Interestingly, proteins involved in biosynthesis
of steroids (Hmger), cell cycle (Mcm5 and Mee),
fatty and biosynthesis (Fasn), glutathione
metabolism (Gstm3), glycerolipid metabolism
(Lipg), glycolysis (Pklr), gluconeogenesis, MAPK
signalingpathways(Hspa1a)andpurinemetabolism
(Ecgf1) were found to be induced by benzene.
However, genes responsible for metabolism of
xenobiotics (Cyp2b10), transcription factor
(Gtf2ird1), cell adhesion (Cldn15 and Cldn1), cir-
cadian rhythm (Per3 andArnt1), cytokines (Pdgfc),
and glycine, serine and thireonine metabolism
(Gldc) were down regulated (Table 1).
Important pathways affected after 24 hrs of
benzene treatment included β-cell receptor signal-
ing pathways (Iﬁtm1), cell cycle; signaling path-
way; focal adhesion; Jak-STAT signaling pathway,
circadian rthym (Cry1), cytokine-cytokine receptor
interaction (Ccr5), glutathione metabolism
(Gstm3), hematopoietic cell lineage (Cd24a) and
TGF-beta signaling pathway (Id3 and Id1).
Analysis of pathway level
After t test and fold differences ﬁltering, 44 genes
were found to be up or down regulated by benzene
treatment. Analysis of differentially regulated
genes showed the involvement of calcium signal-
ing pathway, cell adhesion molecules pathway,
circadian rhythms, glutathione-S-transferases and
heat shock proteins in benzene toxicity.
Discussion
It has been accepted now that omic technologies
have signiﬁcant potential in generating novel bio-
markers of exposure, susceptibility and response to
different xenobiotics. Different xenobiotics produce

Minami et al. (2005) in their study on acetamino-
phen (APAP), bromobenzene, carbontetrachloride,
dimethylnitrosamine and thioacetamide identiﬁed
potential biomarkers of their hepatotoxicity. How-
ever, gene expression changes induced by benzene
in the liver are yet to be established. Smith et al.
(2005) showed that toxicogenomics have signiﬁcant
potential in generating biomarkers of benzene
toxicity.Theyidentiﬁedmorethan100differentially
expressed genes, those related to apoptosis and
immune function were most signiﬁcantly affected
in humans occupationally exposed to benzene.
Yoon et al. (2003) investigated benzene induced
hematotoxicity and leukemogenicity using mouse
bone marrow and making cDNA microarray
analysis in C57BL/6, wild type (WT), and p53-
knock out (KO) mice.They suggested that dysfunc-
tion of p53 gene induced fatal problems ﬁnally
resulting in hemopoietic malignancies.

pattern of control group shows similar to 1 day group after benzene treatment). Each row represents a gene on the microarray and each
column represents an individual hepatic mRNA sample of mice. The red and green indicate increased and decreased expression relative to
the control, respectively. The colored branch on each column indicates each sample group: control (Green), 1 day (blue) and 6 days (red)
group after benzene treatment.
Benzene induced gene expression changes in
rat liver after 28 days of oral exposure to benzene
showed disturbances in pathways of biotransforma-
tion, glutathione synthesis, fatty acid and cholesterol
metabolism (Heijne et al. 2005).Wang et al. (2005)
in their study on peripheral white blood cell gene
expression proﬁle of benzene poisoned patients
identiﬁed 38 genes to be associated with benzene

toxicity. Chen et al. (2005) made cDNAmicroarray
analysis of leukocytes in patients of benzene poi-
soning and found 25 genes to be differentially
expressed. Amongst these 16 genes were up-
regulated and 9 genes were down regulated. Some
cDNAreplication and some repair genes associated
with benzene poisoning also showed differential
expression.
Time and dose dependent study on gene expres-
sion made by us shows that after six days of ben-
zene treatment, 44 genes were affected. 25 genes
weredownregulatedand19geneswereupregulated.
This information was further analysed through
KEGG pathway database. Important pathways
affected after 24 hrs of benzene treatment included
β-cell receptor signaling pathways (Iﬁtm1), cell
cycle; signaling pathway; focal adhesion; Jak-
STAT signaling pathway, circadian rthym (Cry1),
cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (Ccr5),
glutathione metabolism (Gstm3), hematopoietic
cell lineage (Cd24a) and TGF-beta signaling path-
way (Id3 and Id1).
We for the ﬁrst time report that circadian rhythm
pathway (Cry1) is also affected by benzene
treatment. Rana et al. (2007) observed that circa-
dian rhythms effect lipid peroxidation induced by
benzene. Susceptibility of humans and rats to ben-
zene during morning and evening was conducted
by Leung and Harrison (1998) and Starek et al.

observed after six days of benzene treatment clearly
shows the inﬂuence of circadian rhythms on ben-
zene toxicity. Circadian rhythms are further regu-
lated by protein synthesis and we show that these
genes too were inﬂuenced by benzene. Present
report conﬁrms the inﬂuence of circadian rhythms
on benzene hepatotoxicity. Rana and Verma (2005)
reviewed the biochemical toxicity of benzene.
However, this new information is expected to help
in understanding the molecular mechanisms of
benzene toxicity.
Interestingly, proteins involved in biosynthesis
of steroids (Hmger), cell cycle (Mcm5 and Mee),
fatty acid biosynthesis (Fasn), glutathione
metabolism (Gstm3), glycerolipid metabolism
(Lipg), glycolysis (Pklr), gluconeogenesis, MAPK
signaling pathways (Hspa1a) and purine metabo-
lism (Ecgf1) were found to be induced by benzene.
However, genes responsible for metabolism of
xenobiotics (Cyp2b10), transcription factor
(Gtf2ird1), cell adhesion (Cldn15 and Cldn1), cir-
cadian rhythm (Per3 andArnt1), cytokines (Pdgfc),
and glycine, serine and thireonine metabolism
(Gldc) were down regulated (Table 1).
Biochemical and histopathological observations
show that six days treatment with benzene encour-
aged an adaptive mechanism in the liver. Gene
expression studies especially those of CYP2610,
CYP4A10 that were found to be down-regulated
ﬁnd support from the biochemical and histopatho-
logical results. Upregulation of Gstm3 and Hspa1a
further suggest a protective mechanism.
The pathway analysis shows the involvement
of calcium signaling, transferases and heat shock
proteins in benzene toxicity. Present observations
offer additional information on the molecular
mechanisms of benzene toxicity. The cDNA
microarray system showed alterations in the
number of benzene affected genes including
physiologic and toxicologic gene repertoires. This
communication provides valuable targets for
future investigations on the benzene induced
toxicity and leukernogenicity.
