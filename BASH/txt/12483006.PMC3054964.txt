INTRODUCTION
Osteonecrosis (ON) can accompany a wide variety of disease
processes, such as trauma, hemoglobinopathy, exogeneous and
endogeneoushypercortisolism,alcoholism,pancreatitis,dysbaric
conditions, and Gaucher’s disease (1-4). Following steroid
therapy the increase in pressure and fat cell volume in the
marrow cavity leads to a collapse of the sinusoids in the femoral
head. This phenomenon may be a contributing factor to some
forms of ON (5-8).
Aplastic anemia is a rare hematologic disorder characterized
by hypocellular fatty marrow (9). The high fat content of the
marrow in aplastic anemia results in high signal intensity (SI)
on magnetic resonance (MR) images, reflecting the prepon-
derance of fatty marrow and the relative lack of hematopoi-
etic marrow (10-15). Using MR imaging, fat conversion has
been observed to occur in the proximal femoral metaphysis of
steroid-treated patients and is increased in osteonecrotic hips
(8, 16-19). Treatment-related ON in patients with aplastic
anemia has been reported in several cases (20-23), but a causal
relationship between aplastic anemia and ON has not yet been
determined.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and
clinical and MR imaging features of ON in the hips of patients
with aplastic anemia whose bone marrow had been replaced
by extensive fat.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
From January 1994 to May 1998, we performed MR imag-
ing in 241 patients with aplastic anemia to assess bone marrow
cellularity at the time of initial diagnosis. They were 125 male
and 116 female patients with a mean age of 31 yr (range, 16-
60 yr). MR imaging of bone marrow was performed with a
0.5 T (Gyroscan T5, Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands)
superconductive MR scanner. The imaging protocol for eval-
uating the cellularity of bone marrow was as follows: sagittal
T1-weighted image (T1W1) (TR/TE=560/30 msec) and short
tau inversion recovery (STIR), (TR/TE/TI=1,400/30/120
msec) images of the lumbar spine with a 5-mm thickness, a
0.5-mm intersection gap, a 205×256 matrix, four-signal
acquisition, and a 350-mm field of view and coronal T1WI of
the pelvis (TR/TE=560/30 msec) with a 6-mm slice thickness
and a 0.6-mm intersection gap. In a limited number of cases
we used a 1.5 T (Magnetom Vision Plus, Siemens, Erlangen,
Germany) superconductive MR scanner and added fat-satu-
rated, enhanced, T1-weighted sequences.
On the coronal T1WI of the pelvis obtained during MR
imaging of the bone marrow, we diagnosed ON and assessed
bilaterality, as well as the extent of ON, and the marrow status
of proximal femoral metaphysis, such as fatty or red, by visual
inspection with the agreement of two radiologists. ON was
diagnosed when the normal intense signal of the marrow fat
was noticeably decreased in the subchondral region of the

Osteonecrosis of the Hip in Patients with Aplastic Anemia
The incidence and clinical and magnetic resonance imaging features of osteonecro-
sis of the hip were evaluated in patients with aplastic anemia. Two hundred and
forty-one patients with aplastic anemia were examined using MR imaging of bone
marrow during the five years from 1994 to 1998. Osteonecrosis of the hip was
observed on MR imaging in nineteen (15 males and 4 females, mean age 35 yr)
of the 241 patients. It was present in both hips in 14 patients, and there were five
cases with unilateral occurrence, with a total of 33 involved hips. All except for five
hips with associated bone marrow edema revealed increased fatty marrow conver-
sion in the proximal femoral metaphysis. In nine patients, osteonecrosis was detect-
ed without any pain. Five patients already had osteonecrosis before any medication
was administered. Twelve patients received antilymphocyte globulin, and seven
patients received a low dose of steroids before the MR diagnosis of osteonecrosis.
Osteonecrosis of the hip frequently develops in patients with aplastic anemia (7.9%),
associated with fatty marrow conversion of the proximal femoral metaphysis .

femoral head, as well as then the border of the necrosis was
demarcated by a rim of low signal (24, 25). The clinical pres-
ence or absence of hip pain and history of medication before
the development of ON were also evaluated.
RESULTS
Among the 241 aplastic anemia patients whose bone mar-
row was examined using MR imaging, we found ON of the
hip in 19 patients. The cumulative incidence of ON of the
hip in patients with aplastic anemia was 7.9%. There were
15 men and 4 women, who ranged in age from 19 to 46 yr
(mean 35 yr).
In 14 of these patients, both hips were affected while five
patients had unilateral ON. Therefore, a total of 33 hips were
involved. In 26 of these hips, the extent of necrosis exceeded
50% of the femoral heads but the remaining seven hips exhib-
ited only small crescentric subchondral defects. Necrotic areas
revealed early change of high SI isointense to adjacent fat mar-
row or only slightly decreased SI. All hips exhibited marked
fatty marrow conversion with the exception of the five hips
associated with marrow edema in the proximal femoral meta-
physis.
Five patients (No. 6, 10, 12, 14, 18) already had ON at the
time of MR imaging despite having no history of previous
medication (Fig. 1). Hip pain was reported in ten of the nine-
teen patients. Twelve patients received antilymphocyte globulin
six months to four years before MR imaging (Fig. 2). In seven
patients, corticosteroid (prednisolone, 4 mg/kg daily initially,
then tailing off to zero over 3 weeks) was also administered
for prevention of serum sickness and androgen was adminis-

there was no evidence of osteonecrosis on the right side, the
proximal femoral metaphysis showed high signal intensity, indicat-
ing that the marrow was predominantly fatty. At the time of this
initial MR imaging, this patient already had an osteonecrosis of the
hip but had no pain; the patient had no history of prior medication.

imaging and clinical findings are summarized in Table 1.
DISCUSSION
Aplastic anemia is a potentially severe marrow disorder char-
acterized by peripheral pancytopenia and marrow that is largely
devoid of hematopoietic cells; while retaining the basic marrow
architecture or stroma, hematopoietic cells are replaced by large
amounts of fat (9). MR imaging has been proposed as a non-
invasive and relatively rapid method for evaluation of the bone
marrow composition. An aplastic marrow demonstrates focal
or diffuse bright SI according to the amount of replaced fatty
marrow on T1WI and fatty infiltration in bone marrow can
be confirmed by fat suppression images (10-14). Meanwhile,
as we evaluated the cellularity of bone marrow using MR
imaging for initial assessment of severity in patients with
aplastic anemia, we found ON of the hip in 19 of the 241
patients with aplastic anemia during the 4 yr and 5 months.
There were few data on the incidence or prevalence of ON
among corticosteroid-treated patients and other groups at risk
(1). A systemic review of the published literature estimated the
incidence of ON of the hip in long-term steroid treatment
after transplantation to be approximately 5 to 10% (26, 27).
ON, especially of the femoral head, in association with chronic
alcoholism is fairly common. The incidence rate among alco-
holics may not be as high as expected with the incidence of
5.3% in medically treated alcoholics (28, 29). Radiographic
and pathologic characteristics of ON in patients with aplastic
anemia are not unique, being evident in cases of bony necrosis
due to other causes.
In hematopoietic marrow, the vascular structure is character-
ized by a rich and arborized sinusoidal system. As fatty marrow
cell masses increase, the sinusoidal system is replaced by cap-
illaries which are sparse. In the fatty marrow, perfusion of the
marrow decreases gradually, and consequent vascularization
of this marrow is ineffective due to venous stasis. As a result
of this characteristic vascular structure, fatty marrow is more
vulnerable to ischemia than hematopoietic marrow (12). Alter-
natively, since ischemia or poor perfusion is known to be a
factor that induces fatty marrow conversion, such conversion
is more accelerated in the marrow cavity where fatty marrow
cells begin to be distributed. MR imaging was used to assess
marrow composition because it provides information on the
amount of fat in bones (8, 10-12, 17, 30-32). In fact patients
with ON have an increased incidence of predominantly fatty
marrow in the intertrochanteric portion of the femur depicted
by MR image (17) and the ratio of fatty marrow conversion
of the proximal femoral metaphysis to that of the greater
trochanter measured on T1WI is increased (16). Therefore
MR imaging has enabled researchers to assess the significant
increase in the conversions of fatty marrow in the proximal
femoral metaphysis and the osteonecrotic hips of patients
treated with steroids (8, 16, 17). In our 28 hips, proximal
femoral metaphysis revealed marked fatty marrow conversion
irrespective of the age of the patient.

treated with antilymphocyte globulin followed by high doses
of corticosteroids. In contrast there were no cases of ON with
aplastic anemia treated with an antilymphocyte globulin but
using a short course of low-dose steroid (20-23). In the present
study, ON was diagnosed in five patients with aplastic anemia
before any medication was administered. Reviewing patients’
medical histories, prior to immunotherapy with antilympho-
cyte globulin had been done six months to four years previous-
ly and during that time corticosteroids were only administered
in small doses for short periods of time (prednisolone, 4 mg/kg
daily, tailing off to zero over three weeks) in order to prevent
serum sickness caused by antilymphocyte globulin therapy.
We therefore speculate that increased fatty infiltration in the
bone marrow of patients with aplastic anemia may be a key
factor in the development of ON of the hip.
Our study has several limitations. First, we assessed fatty
marrow conversion of proximal femoral metaphysis visually
and not quantitatively. Secondly, we could not explain why
only a unilateral hip was involved with ON in five patients
despite the occurrence of bilateral extensive fatty conversion
in the proximal femoral metaphysis. Thirdly, longitudinal MR
imaging was not undertaken, and only five patients (No. 1,
2, 11, 12, 15) had MR imaging before and after development
of ON. Therefore, we must undertake further longitudinal
studies to assess the possible roles of antilymphocyte globulin,
corticosteroid, or combination therapy in the development of
ON in patients with aplastic anemia.
In conclusion, we demonstrated ON of the hip developed
frequently in patients with aplastic anemia, its cumulative
incidence for 4 yr and 5 months being about 7.4%. Increased
fatty marrow conversion of proximal femoral metaphysis may
be associated with ON of the hip in patients with aplastic
anemia.
