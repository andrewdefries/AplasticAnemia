Abstract
Background: Aplastic anemia (AA) is a bone marrow failure syndrome mostly characterized by
an immune-mediated destruction of marrow hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells. The resulting
hypocellularity limits a detailed analysis of the cellular immune response. To overcome this
technical problem we performed a microarray analysis of CD3+ T-cells derived from bone marrow
aspirates and peripheral blood samples of newly diagnosed AA patients and healthy volunteers.
Two AA patients were additionally analyzed after achieving a partial remission following
immunosuppression. The regulation of selected candidate genes was confirmed by real-time RT-
PCR.
Results: Among more than 22.200 transcripts, 583 genes were differentially expressed in the bone
marrow of AA patients compared to healthy controls. Dysregulated genes are involved in T-cell
mediated cytotoxicity, immune response of Th1 differentiated T-cells, and major regulators of
immune function. In hematological remission the expression levels of several candidate genes tend
to normalize, such as immune regulators and genes involved in proinflammatory immune response.
Conclusion: Our study suggests a pivotal role of Th1/Tc1 differentiated T-cells in immune-
mediated marrow destruction of AA patients. Most importantly, immune regulatory genes could
be identified, which are likely involved in the recovery of hematopoiesis and may help to design new
therapeutic strategies in bone marrow failure syndromes.
Background
Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare bone marrow fail-
ure state characterized by marrow hypocellularity and low
peripheral blood cell counts [1]. Although the exact path-
ogenic mechanism is still unknown, beside a primary
stem cell defect [2] and a disturbed microenvironment

[3], pre-/clinical data suggest an immune-mediated
destruction of marrow progenitor/stem cells [1,4]. Similar
to other autoimmune diseases, antigen-specific T cells
could be expanded from the bone marrow of AA patients
and likely mediate organ-specific cytotoxicity to hemat-
opoietic stem cells and progenitor cells [5]. In addition, it
has been reported that the bone marrow of AA patients
contains increased numbers of apoptotic cells [6] and that
hematopoietic stem cells of AA patients express Fas anti-
gen [7]. Peripheral blood and bone marrow T-cells show
signs of activation [8], secrete high levels of interferon-
gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α).
These two cytokines may suppress the proliferation of
early and late hematopoietic progenitor cells and initiate
apoptosis by induction of Fas on CD34+ stem cells [9,10].
Most recently, some groups reported a polarization of
CD4+ T-cells towards a type-1 immune response that leads
to activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells with destruction of
marrow stem cells [11]. However, genes important for the
recruitment of effector T-cells to the bone marrow as tar-
get organ of autoimmunity and regulatory molecules
directing their differentiation have not been identified so
far. Therefore, we performed a microarray study compar-
ing gene expression profiles of circulating and marrow-
derived T-cells at initial presentation and after hematolog-
ical recovery in order to elucidate more details of the
mechanism resulting in severe bone marrow failure.
Results
Microarray analysis
Comparative gene expression profiling was performed in
severe aplastic anemia (SAA) patients and healthy con-
trols by analyzing pooled CD3+ T-cells isolated from
peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) samples
(Table 1). Each oligonucleotide microarray (Affymetrix
HG_U133A) contained 22.218 human probesets and in
our experiments discovered between 48.1% and 53.7%
"present calls" as calculated by the statistical detection
algorithm of Affymetrix. In general, "present calls" of
approximately 50% provide confidential results. Scaled
factors which were used to normalize the arrays to an aver-
age intensity ranged from 0.915 to 1.544 showing the
high reproducibility of the experimental procedure. Fur-
thermore, the hybridisation was monitored by the usage
of hybridisation controls comparing total RNA amount
and final signal intensity on the array (r > 0.99). Taken
together, our data reached a highly acceptable quality
level for further analysis.
To eliminate genes which may be individually regulated
independent of disease we focused in our study only on
genes coregulated in both of the analyzed SAA pools
(pool I and IIa) in comparison to the normal controls
(pool III), each separately for PB and BM samples. The
potentially disease-specific (dys-)regulation comprised a
wide variety of genes belonging to different functional
classes, such as immune response, proliferation/cell
growth, biosynthesis/metabolism, signal transduction
and apoptosis (Figure 1). The most interesting genes are
summarized below, whereas the entire data set is available
at the GEO database [12] under the accession number
GSE3807.
Gene expression profiles of T-cells from SAA patients at
initial diagnosis
The circulating T-cells isolated from the PB samples of
SAA patients exhibited a broadly normal gene expression
profile with dysregulation of only 42 genes (35 up- and 7
downregulated) in both of the analyzed SAA pools. In
contrast, in comparison to the control pool T-cells iso-
lated from BM aspirations showed a dysregulation of 583
genes (125 up- and 458 downregulated), which were
coregulated in both SAA pools. Among the regulated
genes identified in circulating T-cells some were also dif-

ferentially expressed in BM-derived T-lymphocytes (i.e.
IRS2, BASP1, EGR1, Lyn) and other molecules were only
regulated in PB samples (i.e. IL6R, TNFAIP3, BCL3). Dif-
ferentially expressed genes, which were exclusively found
in BM-infiltrating T-cells, were classified into several func-
tional categories (Figure 1). These genes included mole-
cules involved in immune responses and their regulation
with the following fold changes for SAA pool I and IIa,
respectively: PF-4 (-157-fold; -188-fold), CD26 (+2.2-
fold; +2.1-fold), Ncf-1 (-3.9-fold; -2.2-fold), CCR2 (+2.7-
fold; +2.7-fold), CX3CR1 (+4.3-fold; +2.9-fold) and other
chemokine receptors and ligands. Many cytokines/growth
factors and their receptors, which play an important role
in inflammation and endogenous response to infections,
were found to be dysregulated like IL-1α (-25.9-fold; -
40.3-fold), IRAK3 (-5.9; -88-fold), LTβ (+2.2-fold; +2.2-
fold), Toll-like receptor 2 (-10.4-fold; -5.0-fold) and
CIAS1 (-23.5-fold; -6.3-fold). Furthermore molecules
important for the regulation of proliferation and cell
cycling were dysregulated (i.e., SOCS2, JAG1, VEGF,
SKIL). Finally, several transcription factors were found to
be differentially expressed in SAA patients (i.e., STAT1,
STAT5B and IRF2).
To obtain more information, we also set a minimum fold
change of 1.5 revealing an upregulation of genes in BM-
derived CD3+ T-cells from SAA patients playing an impor-
tant role in the regulation of apoptosis, like TRADD (+1.8-
fold; +1.8-fold), TRAF5 (+1.8-fold; +1.8-fold), perforin-1
(+2.2-fold; +1.7-fold), granzyme H (+2.9-fold; +1.8-fold)
and granzyme B (+2.6-fold; +1.5-fold).
In order to examine whether the obtained differential
gene expression profiles in the analyzed SAA patients sim-
ply reflect an over- or under-representation of T-cell sub-
populations, the differential gene expression pattern
identified in circulating T-cells of SAA patients (pool I and
IIa of the PB) were compared with gene expression pro-
files of effector memory versus naive CD4+ and CD8+ T-
cell populations generated from normal donors [13,14].
The comparative analysis of effector memory and naïve
CD4+ (effector memory and naïve CD8+ T-cells, respec-
tively) shows that 301 genes (n = 1360, respectively) are
statistically singificantly regulated in one of the analyzed
subpopulations (p < 0.05, student's t-test). Interestingly,
only 5 (n = 8, respectively) of these genes exhibited a sim-
ilar expression pattern in the circulating CD3+ T-cells of
the SAA patient pools (Figure 2).

Gene expression profiles of CD3+ T-cells from AA patients
in remission
Gene expression profiles (Figure 3) were performed of
CD3+ T-cells isolated from PB and BM samples of 2 SAA
patients after achieving a hematological remission follow-
ing immunosuppressive therapy (pool IIb). Data were
analyzed with statistical tools as described in the method
part and directly compared to their respective gene expres-
sion profile at initial presentation (pool IIa). In order to
provide a better overview, we performed a hierarchical
cluster analysis including genes that tend to normalize
with respect to the gene expression levels detected in the
normal control pools (Figure 4a). In total, we identified
60 of 583 regulated genes in the BM samples of the ana-
lyzed SAA patients turning to nearly normal gene expres-
sion levels after successful immunotherapy. This category
mainly included genes involved in the regulation of
immune response like Ncf1. In the PB samples of the SAA
pool only one of 42 regulated genes (MT1E) tended to
expression levels close to the normal control pool, but its
function in the immune system is unknown.
Furthermore, the comparison of the gene expression pro-
files (pool IIa vs IIb) revealed a group of several genes with
a very high difference (> 4-fold) in the expression level
before and after successful immunotherapy (Figure 4b).
Most of these genes are important during inflammation
and regulation of immune response, such as platelet-fac-
tor 4 (PF4), proteoglycan 2 und 3 (PRG2, PRG3), IL-1α,
IRAK3, osteopontin (SPP1), receptor for Fc fragment of
IgE (FCER1A) or RNASE3. The fold changes of regulated
candidate genes are summarized in Table 2.

genes in CD3+ T-cells of SAA patients. The gene expression data of effector memory T-cell populations were compared
separately for each of 3 normal donors with the mean gene expression level of the respective naive T-cell populations [13, 14].
Significantly regulated genes (p < 0.05, student's t-test) were further analyzed in comparison to the differential gene expression
pattern of SAA patients (pool I and pool IIa of the PB). Number of commonly and differentially expressed genes is shown for
effector memory versus naïve CD4+ T-cells in comparison to circulating CD3+ T-cells of SAA patients (part A) and also for
the respective CD8+ T-cell subpopulations (part B).

Validation of microarray data by real-time RT-PCR
To confirm the microarray results, quantitative real-time
RT-PCR of selected candidate genes was performed using
the original patient sample pools (pool I, IIa) and patient
6 in hematological remission. Because of limited amounts
of pooled RNA, 4 genes were selected for quantification of
gene expression using a new pool of normal BM samples.
Even with this new sample pool the regulation of gene
expression could be confirmed for the 4 analyzed genes
(Figure 5). For example, separate microarray experiments
revealed an increased expression for CD26 in pools I and
IIa (2.17-fold; 2.07-fold), which could be confirmed by
real-time RT-PCR (2.2-fold; 3.5-fold). In general, real-
time RT-PCR results correlated well with the differential
gene expression data of the microarray experiments.
Discussion
In acquired aplastic anemia, the evidence of an autoim-
mune pathogenesis is mostly indirect and the characteri-
zation of the underlying immune response is incomplete
mainly due to technical difficulties resulting from the dis-
ease-specific hypocellularity. However, there is growing
evidence that AA results from autoaggressive destruction
of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors mediated by
T-cells recognizing inciting target antigens [1]. Several
groups have identified clonal T-cell expansion [15-17],
proinflammatory cytokine production [9] and T-cell
mediated cytotoxicity to CD34+ stem cells [5,7] support-
ing an antigen-driven T-cell response. Most recently, we
could characterize the antigen-binding sites of clonally
expanded T-cells in SAA patients and identified the emer-
gence of new T-cell clones after successful immunosup-
pression [18], suggesting a regulatory T-cell population
contributing to the recovery of hematopoiesis. In this
study, we applied microarray technology to characterize
the immune response of the T-cell system in SAA. The
design of our experiments differed from most recently
reported transcript profiles of AA patients [19] in the fol-
lowing important issues: (a) The untreated patients
included in this study were diagnosed as SAA with similar
clinical characteristics, HLA background, response to ther-
apy and without an expanded PNH clone. (b) Gene pro-
files of CD3+ T-cells from PB and BM samples of the same
SAA patients and healthy controls were compared, as the

pathological T-cell response is expected in the bone mar-
row as target organ of AA. (c) Furthermore, the gene pro-
files of SAA patients were comparatively analyzed with
respect to normal gene expression before and after suc-
cessful immunotherapy in order to identify candidate
genes relevant for the recovery of hematopoiesis.
As expected the gene profiles of CD3+ T-cells isolated
from PB samples differed significantly from the expres-
sion pattern found in BM-derived T-cells of SAA patients.
The number of differentially expressed genes in circulat-
ing T-cells of SAA patients compared to healthy controls
was surprisingly low: Only 42 genes were differentially
expressed in peripheral T-cells of the patients pools. Inter-
estingly among these genes, a negative regulator of
cytokine response, the zinc finger protein TNFAIP3, was
upregulated. The induction of TNFAIP3 may result from
cellular counterregulation in response to high serum lev-
els of TNF and IL-1 [20], as this molecule specifically
inhibits the respective signal transduction pathways [21].
Two important multifunctional regulators of hematopoi-
esis, MIP1α [22] and Skil [23], were regulated in both
peripheral and marrow-derived T-cells at initial diagnosis.
Whereas MIP1α exerts potentially suppressive effects on
the early myelopoiesis in AA [24,25], Skil functions as
negative regulator of TGFβ signaling [25] and its induc-
tion may also represent a counterregulatory event.
In comparison to normal controls, marrow-derived CD3+
T-cells showed a large scale of differentially expressed
genes indicating that T-cell dysregulation in the BM as tar-
get organ is a critical part of the pathological immune
response. The regulation of 483 genes also demonstrates
that the bone marrow failure results from a rather com-
plex genetic program involving chemokines, cytokines,
growth factors, and their receptors. We could identify the
induction of several molecules playing key roles in the
regulation of Th1 immune responses, such as CCR2 and
CX3CR1 [26,27], which are also important in other
autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis [28,29],
and CD26, a surface-bound ectopeptidase expressed at
high levels on Th1 differentiated T-cells [30,31]. The

microarray study identified several genes like CD26, PF4
and Ncf1 with distinct immunregulatory functions. As
these candidate genes were responding to successful
immunotherapy, they might play a key role in the
immunpathogenesis of AA and recovery of hematopoiesis
after immunosuppression: Specific blocking of CD26,
which was upregulated at initial diagnosis and normal-
ized in hematological remission, suppresses the prolifera-
tion of autoreactive T-cells with upregulation of TGF-β1
and downregulation of TNF-α [32]; furthermore CD26
favors cytotoxic effector functions in CD8+ T-cells [33].
Specific binding of the chemokine PF4, which was ini-
tially enourmosly downregulated and almost normalized
after immunotherapy, prevents the release of IL-2 and
IFN-γ in activated T-cells and may especially suppress
autoreactive T cells in the presence of proinflammatory
cytokines [34]. Ncf1, a gene important for oxidative burst
formation, regulates the severity of other autoimmune
diseases and modulates (in-)directly the level of T-cell
dependent autoimmune responses [35]. Taken together,
these candidate genes might be highly relevant for the
autoreactive T-cell attack in AA and the induction of
peripheral tolerance with recovery of the hematopoiesis
following immunotherapy.
In contrast to Zeng et al. [19] we could not identify an
upregulation of several other chemokines/-receptors (i.e.,
CCL14, MIP2α, MIP3α, CXCL1 and CXCL12), which play
a role in other autoimmune diseases. Also inconsistent
with already reported transcript profiles [19] we identifed
a downregulation of several molecules involved in innate
immune responses, such as Toll-like receptor 2, IL-1
receptor-associated kinase (IRAK3), IL-1 and its receptor
in our SAA patient pools. The dysregulation of innate
immunity in SAA patients may result in increased proin-
flammatory cytokine production towards bacterial chal-
lenge as observed in IRAK3-/- mice [36]. In accordance to
earlier reports [37,38] we could identify a downregulation
of IL-1α/β in BM-derived T-cells at initial presentation
with normalization of the expression level for IL-1α after
hematological recovery. Interestingly, the administration
of IL-1 accelerates hematopoietic reconstitution after
chemotherapy induced myelosuppression in vivo [37]
underlining its potential role in marrow failure syn-
dromes. Additionally, the gene expression level of an
important regulator of NFκB-dependent proinflamma-
tory signals, CIAS1, was regulated enormously in the pre-
and post-therapeutic SAA pools. Interestingly, mutations
of CIAS1 cause several autoimmune inflammatory syn-
dromes [39,40] and its downregulation in SAA patients
may contribute to the immunpathology of AA by aug-
mentation of proinflammatory signals. As weakly regu-
lated molecules may also have important influence on
disease development, we additionally analyzed the gene
expression profiles for a minimum fold change of 1.5 and
could reveal an upregulation of several genes related to
cell-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis, such as perforin-
1, granzyme H and B [41]. The involvement of cytotoxic
granules in the induction of target cell apoptosis has
already been shown in AA [42] and other autoimmune
disorders [43]. Interestingly, TRAF and TRADD, two medi-
ators of the TNFR familiy for cell activation, survival and
antiapoptotic function [44] were upregulated in BM-
derived T-cells and may be protective for the effector pop-
ulation in the presence of high TNFα levels.
Conclusion
In summary, our microarray study revealed a Th1/Tc1
phenotype in bone marrow-derived T-cells of SAA
patients at initial presentation. Whereas the potential
mechanism for the recruitment of effector T-cell to the
bone marrow remained unclear, we could identify several
regulators highly relevant for the immunpathogenesis of
AA and likely contributing to the recovery of hematopoi-
esis. Especially the identified regulators of proinflamma-
tory cytokine signaling (IRAK3, CIAS) and molecules with
distinct immunregulatory properties in controlling auto-
reactive T-cells (CD26, PF4, Ncf1) may represent potential
targets for the design of new therapeutic strategies.
Methods
Patients and controls
Six patients with newly diagnosed severe aplastic anemia
(SAA) were included in the study after written informed
consent to protocols approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the Medizinische Hochschule Hannover. Bone
marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples were
obtained before (n = 6) and after achieving a hematolog-
ical remission (n = 2) following immunosuppressive ther-
apy with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporin A
(Table 1). The diagnosis of SAA was established by PB
counts and BM biopsy as recommended by the Interna-
tional Study of Aplastic Anemia and Agranulocytosis [45];
severitiy was classified according to the criteria of Camitta
et al. [46]. Control samples from healthy volunteers were
obtained after informed consent according to the institu-
tional guidelines.
Isolation of CD3+ T cells, RNA preparation and sample
pooling
Mononucleated cells of PB and BM were separated by
Ficoll-Hypaque sedimentation (Biochrom AG, Berlin,
Germany). CD3+ T-cells were positively selected using
anti-CD3+ microbeads (Miltenyi-Biotec, Gladbach, Ger-
many) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The
purity of the isolated CD3+ T-cells was controlled by FACS
analysis and was higher than 96% with comparable
CD4+/CD8+ ratios. The residual contaminating cell popu-
lations varied in the isolations from the different donors
and represented natural killer cells (1%–2%), dendritic

cells (< 1%), B cells (< 1%), and monocytes (< 1%). Sub-
sequently, total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). One µg of total RNA
of each preparation, respectively, was pooled seperately
for PB and BM as follows: Patients 1–4 prior to therapy
(pool I), patients 5 and 6 prior to therapy (pool IIa),
patients 5 and 6 after therapy in hematological remission
(pool IIb) and healthy donors 1–3 (pool III).
Affymetrix GeneChip assay
Integrity and quality of total RNA isolated from CD3+ T-
cells were checked using Agilent Technologies 2100 Bio-
analyser (Agilent Technologies, Germany). To obtain
biotinylated cRNA for hybridization a one-cycle target
labeling assay was performed. Therefore double-stranded
cDNA was synthesized from 2 or 4 µg of pooled total RNA
(pools as described above) using T7-oligo(dT)-primers
(Eurogentec, Belgium). After clean-up of the ds-cDNA an
in vitro transcription assay was performed in the presence
of biotinylated nucleotides. The amplified and bioti-
nylated cRNA was cleaned up using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen,
Germany) and its yield was determined by spectrophoto-
metric analysis. For each GeneChip to be analysed, 10 µg
cRNA and additional biotinylated hybridization controls
(BioB, BioC, BioD, and Cre) were fragmented and hybrid-
ized to an identical lot of HG_U133A GeneChip Arrays
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) for 16 h at 45°C. Afterwards
the GeneChips were washed and stained with PE-strepta-
vidin in the Fluidic Station 400 and were read out in the
Agilent GeneArray Scanner 2500. All reactions were per-
formed using standard protocols and equipment supplied
by the manufacturer.
Data analysis
Gene expression levels were determined using the Affyme-
trix Microarray Suite 5.0, MicroDB 3.0 and Affymetrix
Data Mining Tool 3.0. For normalization, all array exper-
iments were scaled to a target intensity of 150, otherwise
using the default values of the Microarray suite as previ-
ously described [47]. Filtering of the results was per-
formed as follows: Genes were considered to be regulated
if their fold change was greater/less than or equal to 2. The
statistical parameter for a significant change was less than
0.01 [p-value for changes called increased (I)] or greater
than 0.99 [p-value for changes called decreased (D)]. In
addition, the signal difference of the respective gene
should be greater than 100.
Furthermore, microarray analyses were performed com-
paring the differential gene expression pattern of SAA
patients (pool I and pool IIa of the PB) with profiles of
naive and effector memory CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell popula-
tions generated from 3 different healthy donors, respec-
tively. For this purpose data available at the EBI Array
Express database [13,14] were normalized using the
Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 [47]. The normalized data
were further analyzed using Affymetrix Assist comparing
the expression data of the effector memory T-cell popula-
tion separately for each donor with the mean gene expres-
sion level of the respective naive T-cell populations. Genes
were considered to be regulated if their fold change was
greater/less than or equal to 2. The statistical parameter
for a significant change was p < 0.05 applying the stu-
dent's t-test.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Real-time RT-PCR was performed to confirm expression
levels of RNA transcripts in pool I, pool IIa, patient 6 after
therapy in hematological remission and 2 additional
healthy donors. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA
using oligo-dT primers and M-MLV polymerase (Invitro-
gen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's recom-
mendations. For relative quantification, RPS9 mRNA
served as an external control. The reactions were per-
formed by the ABI PRISM 7000 cycler (Applied Biosys-
tems, Foster City, CA) using SYBR Green PCR Kit
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with sequence-specific oligonu-
cleotide primers. A threshold was set in the linear part of
the amplification curve, and the number of cycles needed
to reach it was calculated for every gene. This threshold
cycle was used to quantify mRNA levels of the target genes
in the analyzed samples with RPS9 normalization.
