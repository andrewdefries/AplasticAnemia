INTRODUCTION
Bacillus anthracis is the etiological
agent of anthrax, the acute and often fatal
infectious disease of herbivores and
humans and is a threatening agent used in
bioterrorism. It is a member of the B.
cereus group, which includes other spore-
forming soil bacteria commonly isolated in
nature, B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, B.
mycoides, B. weihenstephanensis [1] and
B. pseudomycoides [2]. B. cereus causes
food-borne gastroenteritis and opportunis-
tic infections in immunocompromised
patients [3-6], and other members have
been reported to be potentially enteropath-

There have been many efforts to develop Bacillus anthracis detection assays, but the prob-
lem of false-positive results has often been encountered. Therefore, to validate an assay
for B. anthracis detection, it is critical to examine its specificity with the most closely relat-
ed Bacillus isolates that are available. To define the most closely related Bacillus isolates
to B. anthracis in our Bacillus collections, we analyzed by multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) the phylogeny of 77 closely related Bacillus isolates selected from 264 Bacillus iso-
lates. The selection includes all the Bacillus isolates that have been shown in our previous
studies to produce false-positive results by some anthrax-detection assays. The MLST
phylogenetic analyses revealed that 27 of the non-B. anthracis isolates clustered within the
B. anthracis clade, and four of them (three sequence types, STs) had the highest degree
of genetic relatedness with B. anthracis, 18 (11 STs) had the second highest, and five (five
STs) had the third highest. We anticipate that the inclusion of the 19 ST isolates when ana-
lyzing B. anthracis detection assays will prove to be useful for screening for their specifici-
ty to detect B. anthracis.
ogenic [7-11]. Amongst this group, B.
cereus and B. thuringiensis are genetically
and phenotypically closely related to B.
anthracis, and the unambiguous identifica-
tion of these organisms has been difficult
[12]. However, the unambiguous and rapid
diagnostic detection of B. anthracis is
important for early treatment and control of
anthrax due to its highly pathogenic nature
to animals and humans. Many methods
have been developed to detect B.
anthracis, but these methods have revealed
some undesirable problems. The early
reported PCR-based methods [13-17],
which target only virulence genes located
on the plasmids of B. anthracis, can readi-
ly differentiate vaccine or fully virulent B.
anthracis plasmid genotypes. But when
using these methods, plasmid-cured B.
anthracis [18-21], species containing the
transferred plasmids or virulence genes
[22-31], or near-neighbor species contain-
ing closely-related B. anthracis plasmids
[32] are very difficult to distinguish from
B. anthracis. Therefore, PCR-based meth-
ods targeting the B. anthracis chromosome
for B. anthracis detection have been devel-
oped but suffer from lack of assay speci-
ficity; Ba813 [16, 33, 34], vrrA gene [35-
37], gyrase B gene (gyrB) [38], SG-850
[39], the β subunit of RNA polymerase
gene (rpoβ) [40] and the gyrase A (gyrA)
gene [41].
When these assays were originally
developed, the most closely related
Bacillus species were not examined, and
afterwards the assays were revealed not to
be specific by further examination of other
closely related Bacillus species. In our
previous studies on developing highly spe-
cific PCR detection methods for B.
anthracis (manuscript in preparation and
[12]), we used 272 isolates of bacteria to
verify the specificity of our detection
assay. We compared the specificity of our
detection assay to the specificity of previ-
ously reported B. anthracis detection
assays, and the results revealed that as
many as 42 isolates showed false-positive
results when using one of the previous
detection assays. This result motivated us
to study and define the most closely relat-
ed Bacillus isolates to B. anthracis. Once
we identify Bacillus isolates that are the
most closely related to B. anthracis and
include these isolates first when examin-
ing B. anthracis detection assays, we can
readily screen the specificity of these
assays and search for the highly specific
ones.
For this purpose, we have determined
the most closely related Bacillus isolates
among 77 isolates selected from 264
Bacillus isolates, many of which have
shown false-positive results by the previ-
ously reported assays, by analyzing their
phylogenetic relatedness to B. anthracis
using multilocus sequence typing
(MLST)†
with seven house keeping genes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and DNA isolation
A total of 77 strains used in this study
are shown in Table 1. The strains, except
for B. anthracis, were acquired from the
American Type Culture collection
(Manassas, Virginia), Bacillus Genetic
Stock Center (Department of
Biochemistry, The Ohio State University,
Columbus, Ohio), Deutsche Sammlung
von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen
(Braunschweig, Germany), Korean
Collection for Type Cultures (Dajeon,
Korea) and Korean Culture Center of
Microorganisms (Seoul, Korea), and Dr.
Terrance Leighton (Children’s Hospital
Oakland Research Institute, Oakland,
California). B. anthracis genomic DNA
preparations were a gift from Chung-Ang
University Medical College. Genomic
DNA from other strains was isolated
using the Easy-DNA kit (Invitrogen
Corporation, Carlsbad, California)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
DNA concentrations were determined
spectrophotometrically [42].

4 Kim et al: The most closely related Bacillus isolates to B. anthracis
MLST and data analysis
We amplified fragments of seven
housekeeping genes (glpF, gmk, ilvD, pta,
pur, pycA, and tpi) by PCR as described on
the website for MLST of B. cereus
(www.pubmlst.org/bcereus) using the
standard primers. The PCR fragments
were sequenced in both directions using
the amplification primers to provide
unambiguous sequence data.
The allele sequences were compared
with existing allele sequences on the B.
cereus MLST website using Sequence
Comparator software (www.pubmlst.org/
bcereus) [43] and given new allele num-
bers if they differed from known alleles.
The seven allele numbers define a
sequence type (ST) a number of which was
assigned to each new allele combination.
To improve the discrimination between
divergent lineages, analyses were conduct-
ed after each gene was split into three seg-
ments as described by Helgason et al [44].
Allele numbers were assigned indepen-
dently for each gene region, and the allelic
profiles were then combinations of 21
numbers. To assess the genetic relatedness
among the isolates, a dendrogram based on
the allelic profiles was constructed by
using the unweighted pair group method
with arithmetic means (UPGMA) applied
to a matrix of pairwise distances, defined
as the percentages of allelic differences
between profiles, by means of the MEGA
2.1 analysis package [45]. In addition, the
concatenated sequences for the seven gene
fragments were used for building neighbor-
joining trees using the MEGA software.
The two phylogenentic dendrograms were
compared to determine the most closely
related isolates to B. anthracis.
Standard MLST statistics such as num-
ber of polymorphic sites and allele frequen-
cies were computed by using the START
v1.0.5 (www.pubmlst.org/ bcereus) [43].
RESULTS
Allelic profiles and sequence types
The lengths of the fragments analyzed
ranged from 348 bp (pur) to 504 bp (gmk).
The sequences of the seven gene frag-
ments amplified from the isolates had vari-
able sites from 9.2 percent (tpi) to 27 per-
cent (ilvD), which resulted in 17 to 35 dis-
tinct alleles for the different loci (Table 2).
The average number of alleles per locus
was 29.3. No insertions or deletions were
observed in any of the sequences. The
average dN/dS values ranged from 0.0107
(pta) to 0.0791 (tpi), indicating that most

of the sequence variability identified is
selectively neutral.
Altogether, 48 unique STs were
observed in the 77 isolates (Table 3), and
32 of the STs (67 percent) were identified
only once. Three STs were observed in B.
anthracis isolates, and ST 1 was the most
frequent type of B. anthracis.
Interestingly, even though B. anthracis
isolates did not have the same ST as any
other B. cereus group isolates, some B.
cereus group strains shared one or more
alleles with B. anthracis. B. thuringiensis
BGSC 4AJ1 had four alleles (gmk, pta,
pur, and tpi) that were the same as B.
anthracis; B. thuringiensis BGSC 4AB1
and 4BA1 had three same alleles (gmk,
pta, and pur); B. thuringiensis strains
BGSC 4AY1, 4CC1, Bacillus species 1B,
III, 003, III BL, III BS, IV, DM55, and
PT030101-01 had two same alleles (gmk
and pta); and B. thuringiensis strains
BGSC 4BY1, 4CB1, 4AS1, 97-27, B.
cereus strains BGSC 6E1, 6E2, and KCTC
1661 had the same gmk allele.
Phylogenetic relatedness
To estimate the degree of genetic
relatedness of the closely related Bacillus
isolates to B. anthracis, we constructed
two dendrograms using the improved
MLST methods; one of them was built in
the similar way to the standard MLST but
instead used split profiles of the gene frag-
ments (Table 4) and the other one was
done by the neighbor-joining method
using the concatenated sequences for the
seven gene fragments. Clustering of the
Bacillus isolates in both dendrograms
revealed three major clades (Figures 1 and
2); within clade I, B. anthracis clustered
with many of the B. cereus and B.
thuringiensis isolates; within clade II, B.
cereus and B. thuringiensis, unidentified
Bacillus isolates, and one isolate of B.
mycoides clustered together; and within
clade III, the former dendrogram (Figure
1) showed that many of the B. mycoides
isolates clustered with B. thuringiensis and
B. cereus isolates but the latter one showed
with more reliability that all the B.
mycoides isolates except one clustered
within clade III, separately from the B.
cereus and B. thuringiensis isolates
(Figure 2). However, the Bacillus isolates
clustering with Bacillus anthracis within
the clade I were grouped in a very similar
way in both dendrograms, but in the latter
dendrogram, clade I had six more isolates
than the clade I of the former one; these
isolates clustered within clade II separate-
ly from the clade I of the former one.
Twenty-seven non-B. anthracis isolates
clustered with B. anthracis in clade I of
both dendrograms: B. thuringiensis BGSC
strains 4AJ1, 4AB1, 4BA1, 4CC1, 4AS1,
4AY1, 4BY1, 4CB1, 4CD1, 4Y1, 4BG1,
B. thuringiensis 97-27, B. thuringiensis
KCTC 1014, B. cereus BGSC strains 6E1
and 6E2, B. cereus KCTC 1661, Bacillus
isolates DM55, III, III BL, III BS, IV, 003,
1B, S8553/2, PT030101-01, PT030101-
02, 9594/3. All of these B. cereus group
isolates showed false-positive results in
one or more of the previously reported
assays used for B. anthracis detection in
our previous studies (manuscript in prepa-
ration and [12]). Among these, 4AJ1,
4AB1, 4BA1, and 4CC1 were proximate
to B. anthracis in both dendrograms. 4AJ1
and 4CC1 showed false-positives in two to
three assays used for B. anthracis detec-
tion in our previous studies. The six iso-
lates additionally clustered in clade I of the
second dendrogram include three Bacillus
isolates Rho, S10A, and 11R-1, which
were isolated from the patients and soils of
an unidentified epidemic disease in Korea
and were once the isolates of controversy
due to their connection with anthrax.
DISCUSSION
Of the species in the genus Bacillus, B.
anthracis, B. cereus, and B. thuringiensis

Kim et al: The most closely related Bacillus isolates to B. anthracis 7
stantly provoked a nomenclatural contro-
versy. In fact, a high level of genetic relat-
edness amongst these species has been
demonstrated by whole-genome DNA
hybridization [46, 47], 16S and 23S gene
rRNA sequence analysis [48, 49], sequence
analysis of 16S-23S operons [50, 51],
sequence analysis of the gyrB-gyrA inter-
genic spacer region [50], pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis [52, 53], and restriction
fragmentation pattern analysis of the
genome [54]. All of these methods failed to
completely discriminate the species of the
B. cereus group. There is so little difference
amongst these species that some investiga-
tors have suggested that all these organisms
should be classified as a single species [12,
53]. However, the clinical aspects of the
diseases caused by these species are dis-
tinctively different. B. anthracis causes the
highly fatal disease in humans and animals,
B. cereus causes food-poisoning and oppor-
tunistic infections, and B. thuringiensis is
an insect pathogen. Therefore, despite the
nomenclatural controversy that is encoun-
tered due to the high level of genetic relat-
edness amongst these species, a specific
diagnostic assay to identify B. anthracis is
clearly required.
There have been many efforts to
develop a simple, rapid, and accurate
detection assay for B. anthracis using
advanced molecular biology tools. All the
previously developed methods are good at
detecting B. anthracis, but, however,
many of the developed methods have the
problem of lack of specificity, which can
often lead to false-positive results. If these
detection assays are used for the detection
of B. anthracis in society, the possible
occurrence of false-positives can bring
about a false alarm of anthrax to the com-
munity. The potential consequences result-
ing from the shock and anxiety of a false-
positive result on a community should
never be underestimated, particularly
under the current threat of increased
bioterrorism. Thus, when an assay for B.
anthracis detection is developed or is
being developed, the validation of its
specificity is important.
For the specificity analysis, a number
of similar, but not B. anthracis isolates are
required for the test. The more isolates that

be. However, the test isolates should be
closely related to B. anthracis because
false-positive results often occur in tests
with bacteria that are similar to B.
anthracis. The selection of a limited num-
ber of the most closely related isolates to
B. anthracis will be useful and economi-
cal, especially when time, labor and mate-
rials are limited. In addition, the assays
showing low specificity will be detected
early and discarded, avoiding the possible
wasting of time and resources.
To select these isolates among a num-
ber of Bacillus isolates, their genetic relat-
edness to B. anthracis is usually investigat-
ed by analysis of the genetic diversity
amongst them. For this purpose, various
methods including multilocus enzyme elec-
trophoresis, pulsed-field gel electrophore-
sis, and amplified fragment length poly-
morphism have been used. However, these
methods are difficult to standardize
between laboratories, and it is difficult to
compare the results for large strain collec-
tions. MLST has been developed and has
been used successfully when exploring the
population structure of many important
bacterial pathogens [53, 55-66]. This
method is based on sequencing a number of
essential or housekeeping genes spread
around the bacterial chromosome and is a
method that is unambiguous and truly
portable among laboratories [67]. However,
the standard MLST method, which is based
on the allelic profiles of seven gene frag-
ments, was known to have low resolving
power when constructing a dendrogram
[53]. To improve the resolution, MLST
based on split allele profiles or the concate-
nated sequences for the seven gene frag-
ments was attempted, and the resulting den-
drograms are highly resolved [53, 68].
In this study, we applied the standard
MLST as well as two other improved
MLST methods to construct phylogenetic
dendrograms. The dendrogram constructed
by the standard MLST was lowly resolved
(data not presented). The other two
improved MLST methods provided dendro-
grams that were highly resolved to the sim-
ilar degree, but the MLST using the con-
catenated sequences appeared better and
phylogenetically more reliable than the
gene split MLST because it showed good
clustering of B. mycoides isolates out of the
B. thuringiensis and B. cereus cluster. The
dendrograms constructed by these two
methods revealed three major clades among
the Bacillus isolates tested. The composi-
tion of the Bacillus isolates clustering in
clade I of both dendrograms, within which
all the B. anthracis isolates clustered, were
almost similar except for the fact that the
dendrogram of the second method showed
that clade I had six more isolates than the
clade I of the first dendrogram. Clade I
appeared as a B. anthracis clade, and with-
in this clade many Bacillus isolates were
proximate to B. anthracis. This clade was
composed of the isolates that gave false-
positive results by previously reported
assays for B. anthracis detection, and the
degree of proximity to B. anthracis and the
frequency of false-positive results appeared
correlated. For instance, B. thuringiensis
BGSC 4AJ1, which was shown to give
false-positive results by three of the report-
ed assays in our previous studies was the
most proximate to B. anthracis.
In conclusion, we determined 27
Bacillus isolates that are the most closely
related to B. anthracis amongst 77 Bacillus
isolates as shown in the dendrograms. We
believe that considering these strains when
testing the specificity of newly developing or
already developed assays for the detection of
B. anthracis will prove to be very useful and
will help to lead to the development of more
highly specific detection assays.
