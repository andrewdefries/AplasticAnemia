Abstract
Background: Yeast expression systems with altered N-glycosylation are now available to produce glycoproteins
with homogenous, defined N-glycans. However, data on the behaviour of these strains in high cell density
cultivation are scarce.
Results: Here, we report on cultivations under controlled specific growth rate of a GlycoSwitch-Man5 Pichia
pastoris strain producing Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) at high levels (hundreds of
milligrams per liter). We demonstrate that homogenous Man5GlcNAc2 N-glycosylation of the secreted proteins is
achieved at all specific growth rates tested.
Conclusions: Together, these data illustrate that the GlycoSwitch-Man5 P. pastoris is a robust production strain for
homogenously N-glycosylated proteins.
Background
Despite the availability of five classes of heterologous
protein production platforms (bacteria, yeasts, plants,
insect cells, and mammalian cells), more than 50% of
currently marketed biopharmaceuticals are produced in
mammalian cell lines [1]. This is in part due to the
inability of the remaining four classes to modify glyco-
proteins with human-like oligosaccharides. This is of
importance since protein-bound glycans influence circu-
lation half-life, tissue distribution, and biological activity.
In addition, they may be immunogenic. Therefore, engi-
neering of the glycosylation pathway of most currently
used heterologous protein expression systems is an
active field of research [2].
Although many biopharmaceutical companies have
been experimenting for many years with the methylo-
trophic yeast P. pastoris as an expression system for the
production of therapeutic proteins, the first Pichia pro-
duct approval by the FDA was announced only very
recently (KALBITOR, Dyax Corp.). This now established
regulatory approval pathway, together with the recent
availability of glycoengineered strains that produce het-
erologous proteins predominantly as single glycoforms
[3,4], should pave the way for future biopharmaceutical
production. As a result, batch-to-batch variability is
reduced and downstream processing is facilitated due to
increased product homogeneity. Moreover, pharmacoki-
netic and pharmacodynamic properties can be more
easily controlled and fine-tuned, as has been shown for
human IgG [5] and rat erythropoietin [3].
Over the past decade, we have created several glycoen-
gineered P. pastoris strains each capable of modifying its
glycoproteins with predominantly one defined N-glycan
structure [2,4,6,7]. Recently, we have started to explore
their behavior under controlled bioreactor conditions.
The primary goal of these experiments was to determine
the robustness of our strains in terms of N-glycan
homogeneity and product yield when subjected to differ-
ent growth conditions. In this study, we have used a
glycoengineered P. pastoris strain capable of modifying
its glycoproteins with Man5GlcNAc2 N-glycans to
produce murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-
stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as a test protein.

GM-CSF belongs to a family of colony-stimulating
factors that regulate proliferation and differentiation of
hematopoietic cells [8]. In response to inflammatory sti-
muli, GM-CSF is released by various cell types including
T lymphocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial
cells [9,10]. GM-CSF then activates and enhances the
production and survival of neutrophils, eosinophils, and
macrophages [11].
In the clinic, GM-CSF is used for treatment of neutro-
penia and aplastic anemia following chemotherapy and
greatly reduces the risk of infection associated with bone
marrow transplantation. Its utility in myeloid leukemia
treatment and as a vaccine adjuvant is well established
[12,13]. The two GM-CSF analogs currently on the mar-
ket differ from each other and from the native protein on
two points, primary structure and glycosylation status.
Sargramostim is produced in S. cerevisiae. Like native
GM-CSF, it has 127 amino acids and is glycosylated but
differs from native GM-CSF in molecular mass and in
the substitution of leucine for proline at position 23.
Therapeutic GM-CSF expressed in Escherichia coli is not
glycosylated, has six fewer amino acids than the native
protein, and an extra methionine at position 1 [14].
E. coli-produced GM-CSF is also known as Molgramos-
tim (marketed as Leucomax® by Schering-Plough), but
was never approved for use in the United States by the
FDA because it was associated with a higher incidence of
adverse effects than Sargramostim [14]. The latter pro-
duct is produced in S. cerevisiae and is marketed as Leu-
kine® (Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals).
Murine GM-CSF (mGM-CSF) is a 124 amino acid gly-
coprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 14-33
kDa [15]. It contains two intramolecular disulfide bonds
(Cys51-93, Cys85-118), two potential N-glycosylation
sites (Asn66 and 75) as well as sites of O-glycosylation
[16]. The protein is very resistant to denaturing and pro-
teolytic conditions [15]. Non-glycosylated GM-CSF is
fully biologically active and in fact is up to 10 times more
potent than the fully glycosylated protein. The lower
in vitro biological activity of glycosylated GM-CSF is due
to a reduction in receptor binding affininty [17,18].
Here, we describe the design of a basic but robust fed-
batch fermentation process for the production of a
Man5GlcNAc2 glycoform of mGM-CSF by a glycoengi-
neered P. pastoris strain. This approach allowed for
maximal production at high cell densities while main-
taining N-glycan homogeneity.
Materials and methods
Strains and media
Escherichia coli MC1061 was used as the host strain for
plasmid propagation. The bacteria were cultivated in LB
medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5%
sodium chloride) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin.
The P. pastoris GlycoSwitch-Man5 strain modifies its
glycoproteins predominantly with Man5GlcNAc2 N-
glycans. It only differs from a previously reported
GS115-derived strain in the selection marker used to
engineer the N-glycosylation pathway, blasticidin instead
of zeocine [7].
Small-scale P. pastoris cultivation was performed in
BMGY (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1.34% yeast nitro-
gen base, 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer [pH 6.0],
1% glycerol) and BMMY medium (1% yeast extract, 2%
peptone, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 100 mM potassium
phosphate buffer [pH 6.0], 1% methanol).
Fermentations were performed in FM22 medium [19],
which is deionized water containing (per liter): 42.9 g
KH2PO4, 5.0 g (NH4)2SO4, 1.0 g CaSO4.2H2O, 14.3 g
K2SO4, 11.7 g MgSO4.7H2O, 40.0 g glycerol. Prior to
inoculation, the pH was adjusted to 5.0 with concen-
trated ammonium hydroxide followed by the addition of
8.7 ml of Pichia Trace Metals (PTM1; containing, per
liter, 6.0 g CuSO4.5H2O, 0.08 g NaI, 3.0 g MnSO4.H2O,
0.2 g Na2MoO4.2H2O, 0.02 g H3BO3, 0.5 g CoCl2, 20.0
g ZnCl2, 65 g FeSO4.7H2O, 0.2 g biotin, and 5.0 ml
H2SO4).
Vector construction and transformation
The P. pastoris expression vector pPIC9mGM-CSF con-
tains the mature mouse GM-CSF coding sequence fused
in-frame to the S. cerevisiae alfa mating factor signal
sequence under transcriptional control of the AOX1
promoter. The mGM-CSF ORF was amplified by PCR
using pORF9-mGMCSF (Invivogen) as template and
the oligonucleotides 5’-CTAGCTCGAGAAAAGA-
GAGGCTGAAGCCGCACCCACCCGCTCACCC-3’ and
5’-AGTTTAGCGGCCGCTCATTTTTGGCCTGGTTT
TTTGC-3’ as primers (XhoI and NotI restriction sites
are underlined). Subsequently, an XhoI/NotI fragment
was cloned into the XhoI/NotI opened pPIC9 expression
vector (Invitrogen).
Linearized vectors (SalI) were transformed into P. pas-
toris GS115 and GlycoSwitch-Man5 as described [20],
resulting in GS115mGM-CSF and Man5mGM-CSF,
respectively. Genomic integration was confirmed by per-
forming PCR on genomic DNA.
Small scale shake flask expression conditions
Cells were grown in 10 ml BMGY medium at 30°C. After
48 hours of cultivation, the cells were pelleted by centri-
fugation at 3000g for 5 minutes and resuspended in
BMMY medium. Induction was maintained for another
48 hours by spiking the cultures twice daily with 100 μl
of 100% methanol (1% final concentration). Subsequently,
the cultures were harvested by centrifugation (3000g for
10 minutes) and the supernatants were frozen at -20°C
until further use.

Fermentor setup
Fermentations were carried out in 5-liter BioFlo III or
3000 bioreactors (New Brunswick Scientific) containing
two liters of FM22 medium [19] supplemented with 8.7
ml PTM1 trace salts (added after autoclaving). The tem-
perature was maintained at 30°C and the pH at 5.0
(controlled with concentrated ammonium hydroxide).
The dissolved oxygen (DO) was set to 40% and con-
trolled by an agitation/O2 cascade. Pure oxygen was
supplemented as needed to maintain the DO setpoint. A
part of the off-gas was diverted to an MC-168 methanol
monitor and controller (PTI Instruments) equipped with
a TGS822 methanol sensor (Figaro Engineering), which
were used to maintain a constant level of methanol in
the broth. A methanol feed pump (Model 101U/R,
Watson-Marlow), balance (Model PR1203, Mettler
Toledo) and the MC-168 controller were interfaced with
the NBS-BioCommand supervisory control and data
acquisition software to make a closed-loop feed control
system. The amount of methanol delivered was mea-
sured using a balance as the difference between the
initial mass in the methanol tank and the current mass.
The P. pastoris strain Man5mGM-CSF was grown in a
1-liter shake flask with 300 ml BMGY medium for 20-
24 h at 30°C and 300 rpm to an optical density (at 600
nm) of 4-8. Following microscopic examination for con-
tamination, 100 ml of this pre-culture was used as
inoculum.
To increase cell mass and simultaneously prepare the
cells for induction, a glycerol fed-batch phase was per-
formed. A 1-hour fed-batch period was used at a feed
rate of 20 g 50% w/w glycerol (containing 12 ml PTM1
trace salts per liter) per hour per liter of broth. Follow-
ing the fed-batch phase, a transition phase was applied
to shorten the time required for the cells to fully adapt
to methanol. The transition phase was initiated by the
addition of 1.5 g/l methanol. Simultaneously, the gly-
cerol feed rate was ramped down linearly from 20 g/l/h
to 0 over a 3-h period. By the end of the transition
phase, the cells were fully adapted to methanol, which
was confirmed by a sharp drop in DO [21].
Once the cells were fully adapted to methanol, the
methanol fed-batch phase was started. Methanol supple-
mented with 12 ml of PTM1 per liter was used. Two
feeding strategies were applied. The first was a metha-
nol-excess feed strategy in which the methanol concen-
tration was kept constant at ~2 g/l. This allowed the
maximum specific growth rate (μmax) to be determined.
The second strategy used methanol-limited feeding to
maintain the growth rate below μmax at a constant pre-
determined value. This was achieved by varying the
methanol feed rate (F) exponentially, using the following
equation [21]:
F X V eMeOH
t
= ν μ
( )0 0 (1)
X0 is the cell density and V0 the broth volume at the
start of the feeding profile (t = 0), μ is the desired speci-
fic growth rate (h-1
), and νMeOH is the specific methanol
consumption rate (g/g/h). The latter can be calculated
once μmax and νMeOH, max have been determined empiri-
cally under methanol excess conditions. For a desired μ,
νMeOH is estimated by the following equation:
ν μν μMeOH MeOH= ,max max/ (2)
Equation (2) is based on the assumption that the yield
of biomass to substrate YX/S = μmax/νMeOH,max and is
independent of μ and that the maintenance coefficient is
negligible [21].
Protein purification
All purification steps were conducted at 4°C. A GS115
mGM-CSF-secreting clone was grown in BMGY-
containing shake flasks at 30°C. After 24 hours of culti-
vation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and
mGM-CSF protein expression was induced by resus-
pending the cell pellet in BMMY medium containing 2%
methanol. At 24, 36 and 48 hours of induction, 2%
methanol was added to maintain induction. After 60
hours, five liter of cultivation medium was then obtained
upon centrifugation at 18,000g for 30 minutes. Ammo-
nium sulphate was added to 80% saturation and the sus-
pension was incubated overnight to precipitate the
protein fraction. The protein pellet was isolated by cen-
trifugation at 18,000g for 30 minutes and redissolved in
90 ml of 25 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5, 0.1% CHAPS.
After centrifugation at 40,000g for 30 minutes to remove
a minor non-soluble fraction, this solution was desalted
on a Sephadex G25 column of 475 ml (XK26 × 90 cm,
GE Healthcare) to 25 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5, 0.1%
CHAPS. The desalted protein fraction was loaded on a
20 ml Source 15 S column (XK16 × 10 cm, GE Health-
care) to remove contaminants and potential endotoxins.
After equilibration, mGM-CSF was eluted by a linear
gradient over 20 column volumes of NaCl from 0 to 1
M in 25 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5, 0.1% CHAPS. The
obtained fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The
major mGM-CSF-containing fractions were pooled and
loaded onto a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 prep grade
size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) with PBS as the
elution buffer. Following concentration of the product
peak by ultrafiltration (Vivaspin 20, 3000 MWCO; Sar-
torius Stedim Biotech), the mGM-CSF concentration
was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce) and endo-
toxin levels were determined with the ToxinSensor
Chromogenic LAL Endotoxin Assay Kit (GenScript

USA). The process generated 92 mg mGM-CSF from
5 liter of supernatant (18 mg/l) with a purity >95% based
on SDS-PAGE and an endotoxin level of 0.15 EU/mg.
mGM-CSF activity in murine monocyte differentiation into
dendritic cells
Bone marrow (BM) cells (C57Bl/6 mice) were cultured
for 8 days in dendritic cell (DC) culture medium: RPMI
1640 containing GlutaMAX-I, supplemented with 5%
(vol/vol) FCS, 50 μM b-mercaptoethanol and 20 ng/ml
mGM-CSF, the latter either produced in E. coli (Pepro-
tech) or in-house in P. pastoris. Following differentia-
tion, bone marrow-derived DCs (BM-DCs) were
infected for 24 h with Mycobacterium bovis BCG 1721,
a derivative of M. bovis BCG Pasteur, carrying a non-
restrictive rpsL alteration. Following infection, the BM-
DCs were collected by centrifuging (10 min at 150g and
4°C). After washing in PBS, the cells (both infected and
non-infected) were stained for different cell surface mar-
kers, i.e. CD40-biotin (Pharmingen), CD86-biotin (Phar-
mingen), followed by streptavidin-PE, CD80-PE
(Pharmingen), CD273-PE (Pharmingen), CD274-PE
(Pharmingen), CD1d-PE (eBioscience). The expression
of these surface markers was checked on the CD11c
positive population (a marker for DCs) with CD11c-PE-
Cy5 (eBioscience), which was almost 100% in both pre-
parations. Measurements were performed on a FACSCa-
libur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with
CellQuest software.
Analytical techniques
Secreted proteins were TCA precipitated by adding 10%
v/v 10 mg/ml deoxycholate and 10% trichloro acetic
acid. After centrifugation (20 min at >10.000g and 4°C)
the protein pellet was dissolved in Laemmli loading buf-
fer supplemented with 1 M unbuffered Tris to neutralize
the solution and boiled for 10 minutes. Samples were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 15% gels casted in-house
according to [22]. Proteins were visualized by staining
with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma) or blotted onto
nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C extra, 45 μm,
Amersham Life Science) using the Mini Trans-Blot
Cells from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA). Western blot
analysis [23] was performed using a rat anti-mGM-CSF
monoclonal antibody (Imgenex) at a concentration of
1 μg/ml (2 hours) and a horseradish peroxidase-conju-
gated goat anti-rat IgG (Sigma) as the secondary anti-
body (2 hours). Samples were deglycosylated by
treatment with PNGase F (New England Biolabs). N-
linked oligosaccharides were analyzed by fluorophore-
assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE), with an
ABI 3130 capillary DNA sequencer as described pre-
viously [24].
Cell density was expressed as wet cell weight (WCW).
This was done by sampling duplicate 10 ml aliquots of
the fermentation broth into preweighed 15 ml conical
tubes. The samples were centrifuged at 10.000g, the
supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were
weighed. One gram WCW/l is equivalent to ~0.27 g dry
cells/l ~ 1 OD600 [25].
Murine GM-CSF expression levels were quantified by
ELISA (eBioscience). After correction for cell density,
yields were expressed as milligram per liter fermentation
broth.
Results and Discussion
Expression vector construction and GS115mGM-CSF strain
generation
The sequence encoding the mature mGM-CSF protein
was PCR amplified and cloned in the P. pastoris pPIC9
expression vector, in-frame with the S. cerevisiae a-
mating factor prepropeptide coding sequence and under
transcriptional control of the P. pastoris AOX1 promoter.
The resulting vector was termed pPIC9mGM-CSF (Figure
1A). It has been reported that incorporation of Glu-Ala
repeats immediately following the Kex2p recognition site
can significantly increase Kex2p processing efficiency and
final secreted product yield [26]. Therefore, to enhance
cleavage of the secretion signal, we inserted two Glu-Ala
repeats after the Kex2p recognition site (Figure 1B).
Figure 1 (A) Schematic representation of the pPIC9mGM-CSF
expression vector and (B) Secretion signal processing. The S.
cerevisiae a-factor secretion signal is removed by the consecutive
action of two enzymes: Kex2p cleaves between the arginine and
the glutamic acid residue in the sequence EKREAEA; Ste13p
removes both EA repeats.

The SalI-linearized pPIC9mGM-CSF vector was subse-
quently transformed to the wild type P. pastoris strain
GS115. Twelve individual clones were analyzed by SDS-
PAGE for mGM-CSF secretion in the culture superna-
tant (data not shown). Eleven clones effectively pro-
duced mGM-CSF and the one with the highest
expression level was withheld for further analysis. This
strain was named GS115mGM-CSF. SDS-PAGE analysis
showed that mGM-CSF was produced as three molecu-
lar species ranging in molecular weight from ~14 to ~18
kDa (Figure 2). After de-N-glycosylation with PNGase F,
only one ~14 kDa band remained. Since mGM-CSF has
two potential N-glycosylation sites, this indicates that
the upper and middle bands correspond to mGM-CSF
carrying two and one N-glycans, respectively, while the
minor lower band is non-N-glycosylated mGM-CSF
(Figure 2). Although we did not perform N-terminal
sequencing, the fact that de-N-glycosylated mGM-CSF
appeared on SDS-PAGE (Figure 2) and Western blot
(data not shown) as a protein of ~14 kDa (which corre-
sponds very well with a theoretical molecular weight of
14.1 kDa) indicates that Kex2p processing was very
efficient. After all, non-cleavage of the prepropeptide by
Kex2p would have increased the molecular weight by at
least 9 kDa (not taking into account the contribution
of oligosaccharides attached to the three potential N-
glycosylation sites of the prepropeptide). A potential
downside of this approach, however, is subsequent
incomplete removal of both Glu-Ala repeats by Ste13p,
resulting in a final product with two or four additional
N-terminal amino acids. We did not determine the
extent to which this happened, though, since we were
primarily concerned about introducing additional N-gly-
cosylation sites through inefficient Kex2p processing.
P. pastoris-produced mGM-CSF is biologically active
To ascertain that P. pastoris is a suitable host organism
for the production of biologically active mGM-CSF, the
latter was purified from the culture supernatants of
shake flask cultures of GS115mGM-CSF to a final yield
of ~18 mg/l and an endotoxin content of 0.15 EU/mg.
P. pastoris-produced mGM-CSF was then used head-to-
head against commercially available E. coli-produced
mGM-CSF (Peprotech) to differentiate murine bone
marrow-derived monocytes into dendritic cells (BM-
DC). Similar expression of 6 differentiation/activation-
associated cell surface markers on BM-DCs that were
either differentiated with Pichia-derived or E. coli-
derived mGM-CSF demonstrated that both forms are
equally potent. Additionally, both sets of BM-DCs
responded similarly to an M. bovis BCG infection, con-
firming that differentiation with P. pastoris- or E. coli-
derived mGM-CSF does not induce phenotypic differ-
ences during the differentiation process (Figure 3;
results shown are representative for three independent
experiments). This demonstrates that mGM-CSF
produced in P. pastoris is as biologically active as the
commercial E. coli preparation. As a testament to the
quality of the P. pastoris-derived mGM-CSF, immunolo-
gists in our department have switched to utilizing P.
pastoris-derived mGM-CSF for murine dendritic cell
differentiation.
Man5mGM-CSF strain selection
GlycoSwitch-Man5, a glycoengineered GS115-derived
P. pastoris strain that predominantly modifies its glyco-
proteins with Man5GlcNAc2 N-glycans, was subse-
quently used as the host strain. Upon transformation of
the expression vector pPIC9mGM-CSF to GlycoSwitch-
Man5, 18 individual clones were evaluated for
mGM-CSF expression by SDS-PAGE of the culture
supernatant; 13 (68%) expressed mGM-CSF (data not
shown). These clones were designated Man5mGM-CSF.
As did the wild type strain, the GlycoSwitch-Man5
strain produced mGM-CSF as three distinct glycoforms,
i.e., modified with two, one or no N-glycans (Figure 2).
Figure 2 SDS-PAGE analysis of GS115, GS115mGM-CSF and
Man5mGM-CSF culture supernatant untreated (-) or treated
with PNGase F (+). Mouse GM-CSF appears as three molecular
species ranging in molecular mass from approximately 14 to 18
kDa. Treatment with PNGase F showed that the upper two bands
correspond to mGM-CSF carrying two and one N-glycans, while the
minor lower band (indicated with an arrow) is non-N-glycosylated
mGM-CSF. The extra band indicated with an asterisk in both “+”
lanes is PNGase F. The two bands marked with a bracket in the “+”
lanes are highly N-glycosylated endogenous P. pastoris
glycoproteins that, due to their extensive and heterogeneous
modification with carbohydrates, do not present as one single band
on SDS-PAGE. Upon de-N-glycosylation, however, this heterogeneity
is eliminated, resulting in two clearly defined bands.
Jacobs et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2010, 9:93
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/9/1/93
Page 5 of 9
As a result of the engineered N-glycosylation pathway,
however, both N-glycosylated bands possessed a discern-
ible higher electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE com-
pared to GS115-produced mGM-CSF. De-N-
glycosylation with PNGase F completely eliminated this
difference in molecular weight, indicating that it was
entirely attributable to the presence of different size N-
glycans (Figure 2).
Next, for each Man5mGM-CSF clone, the N-glycans
on secreted glycoproteins were analyzed by DSA-FACE.
Based on mGM-CSF expression levels and N-glycan
homogeneity, one clone was withheld for further analy-
sis. Figure 4 shows DSA-FACE profiles for the selected
Man5mGM-CSF clone. The predominant (>90%) N-
linked glycan was Man5GlcNAc2 (Figure 4, panel 3). For
comparison, glycoproteins secreted by wild type P. pas-
toris (GS115mGM-CSF) were mostly modified with a
heterogeneous array of high-mannose-type N-glycans
(Figure 4, panel 2). A minor fraction (<10%) of the total
N-glycan pool secreted by Man5mGM-CSF was com-
posed of higher molecular weight structures (marked
with an asterisk in Figure 4, panel 3). For the majority
of these peaks, however, in vitro a-1,2-mannosidase
digestion did not cause a shift in mobility, indicating
that these peaks were not the result of incomplete
trimming by the introduced T. reesei a-1,2-mannosidase
(in Figure 4, compare panels 3 and 4).
Maximum specific growth rate (μmax) under methanol
excess conditions
To determine μmax of Man5mGM-CSF when methanol
is in excess, bioreactor fermentations were performed
with a constant methanol concentration (S) of ~2 g/l.
Only minor fluctuations in methanol concentration
were observed throughout the fermentations. μmax and
νMeOH,max were 0.0624 h-1
and 0.0743 g/g WCW/h,
respectively. This corresponds to a YX/S (yield of bio-
mass to substrate) of 0.8398 g/g. For comparison, the
‘empty’ GlycoSwitch-Man5 strain, i.e., GlycoSwitch-
Man5 transformed with pPIC9, had a μmax and νMeOH,
max of 0.0816 h-1
and 0.052 g/g WCW/h, respectively,
corresponding to a YX/S value of 1.569 g/g. These data
illustrate the burden that mGM-CSF expression places
on the cells: μmax of Man5mGM-CSF is about 76% of
μmax of Man5. Moreover, under excess methanol condi-
tions, Man5mGM-CSF is about 50% less efficient in
converting methanol to biomass than GlycoSwitch-
Man5.
Figure 3 P. pastoris-produced mGM-CSF is biologically active.
Mouse bone marrow cells were differentiated into DCs using either
E. coli- (black bars) or P. pastoris-produced (grey bars) mGM-CSF. Six
surface maturation markers were measured by flow cytometry on
non-infected (’none’) or M. bovis BCG-infected BM-DCs (’M. bovis’),
which were also CD11c+. Both mGM-CSF preparations were equally
potent in differentiating bone marrow cells into BM-DCs (similar
expression of cell surface markers). The latter also responded
similarly to a stimulus, i.e., infection with M. bovis BCG, regardless of
the source of mGM-CSF used for differentiation. The percentage of
obtained CD11c+ cells was also very similar for both mGM-CSF
sources (almost 100%; data not shown). This demonstrates that,
based on cell surface marker expression and reaction to M. bovis
BCG infection, both sources of mGM-CSF produced phenotypically
indistinguishable BM-DCs.
Figure 4 DSA-FACE analysis of the total N-glycan pool from
Man5mGM-CSF strain. Panel 1 shows the results for a malto-
dextrose reference. Panels 2 through 5 show the results for N-

Methanol-limited cultures
By substitution of μmax and νMeOH,max into equations (1)
and (2), the methanol feed rate, F, needed to achieve a
desired μ could be estimated by the following equation:
F X V e t
= 1 1907 0 0. ( ) .μ μ (3)
The desired values for μ were set to 0.0156 h-1
(25%
μmax), 0.0312 h-1
(50% μmax) and 0.0468 h-1
(75% μmax).
X0 and V0 were determined just prior to the start of the
methanol feed profile. The actual μ values were 0.015 h-1
,
0.0332 h-1
, and 0.0459 h-1
, which correlated very well to
the desired values. Figure 5 shows the evolution of sev-
eral key parameters over time for the fermentation of
Man5mGM-CSF at 0.015 h-1
(~25% of μmax).
mGM-CSF yield
Protein production kinetics of the four fed-batch fer-
mentation types are shown in Figure 6. Murine GM-
CSF yield per unit volume of fermentation broth
(i.e., after correction for cell density) was maximum by
growing the cells at μ = 0.015 h-1
(24.04% μmax) during
the induction phase. In this way, a volumetric yield of
760 mg/l could be achieved after ~68 h of fermentation.
Although volumetric yields decreased slightly after this
time point, total mGM-CSF levels continued to increase
during the entire course of the fermentation. Higher
growth rates resulted in decreased yields (Table 1). Both
growth at μ = 0.0332 h-1
(53.21% μmax) and μ = 0.0459
h-1
(73.56% μmax) decreased yields by about 15.3%.
Allowing the cells to achieve their maximum growth
rate under methanol conditions (μmax = 0.0624 h-1
)
further decreased mGM-CSF yields by as much as 42%
(442 mg/l). Hence, limiting the growth rate during the
induction phase to ~25% of μmax resulted in maximum
mGM-CSF yield. During the entire course of fermenta-
tion, total recombinant mGM-CSF levels kept increasing
regardless of the specific growth rate (data not shown),
indicating that proteolytic degradation was not a signifi-
cant problem. This is in contrast to many other recom-
binant proteins produced in P. pastoris that get
increasingly degraded during the fermentation [27,28].
Figure 5 Fermentation of Man5mGM-CSF at 0.015 h-1
(~25% of
μmax). Plotted parameters show dissolved oxygen (DO), pH,
temperature, OD600, WCW and biomass during 70 hours of
fermentation. The initial batch was grown in FM22 media
containing 40 g/l glycerol. Following an increase in DO due to
carbon source limitation at around 20 h EFT, the glycerol fed-batch
process was initiated. Glycerol was added at 20 g/l/h for 1 hour.
The transition phase was initiated by the addition of 1.5 g/l
methanol. Simultaneously, the glycerol feed rate was ramped down
linearly from 20 g/l/h to 0 over a 3-h period. By the end of the
transition phase, the cells were fully adapted to methanol, which
was confirmed by a sharp drop in DO. At this point, methanol
feeding was initiated. DO was maintained at 40%.

N-glycan analysis
Fermentation supernatant samples were analyzed by
DSA-FACE (Figure 7). The predominant peak during
the entire course of all fermentations was Man5-
GlcNAc2. Even after >100 hours of fermentation, the
level of N-glycan homogeneity was comparable to the
level obtained in small scale cultures [2]. Since all fer-
mentations were performed under non-selective condi-
tions, this illustrates the stability of the Man5mGM-CSF
strain after multiple generations.
Regardless of the specific growth rate, DSA-FACE ana-
lysis revealed the presence of low-abundance peaks. Sev-
eral of these derive from the cultivation medium (not
shown), but there is a small fraction (<10%) of larger N-
glycan species corresponding to Man6-10GlcNAc2 struc-
tures. These oligosaccharides are believed to be the result
of 1) incomplete processing by the introduced a-1,2-
mannosidase-HDEL, 2) interfering endogenous mannosyl-
transferases, or 3) a combination of those two. Impor-
tantly though, growth under fermentation conditions did
not decrease the conversion efficiency of P. pastoris
hypermannosyl-type N-glycans to Man5GlcNAc2 struc-
tures as compared to small scale cultivation experiments,
again illustrating the robustness of this strain.
Conclusions
In this paper, we describe a basic but robust fed-batch
fermentation protocol for the secreted production of
murine GM-CSF in a glycoengineered P. pastoris strain
that predominantly modifies its glycoproteins with
Man5GlcNAc2 N-glycans. We have shown that growth
rate does not significantly affect N-glycan homogeneity:
regardless of the specific growth rate the predominant
peak during the entire course of all fermentations was
Man5GlcNAc2. There was, however, a clear relationship
between product yield and specific growth rate. Culti-
vation of the cells at ~25% of their maximal growth
rate (μ = 0.015 h-1
) resulted in a volumetric yield of
~760 mg mGM-CSF per liter fermentation broth after
~68 h of fermentation. Higher specific growth rates
during the induction phase resulted in decreased
mGM-CSF yields.
To date, only one similar study has been published. In
this paper, researchers at GlycoFi Inc. (a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Merck & Co Inc.) describe a strain capable
of producing >1g/l of human IgG1 with >90% homoge-
neous Man5GlcNAc2 N-glycans across a range of fer-
mentation conditions [29]. Unfortunately, the report did
not include N-glycan analysis data, which precludes a
more direct comparison with our data.
However, it is clear from both reports that conver-
sion of the P. pastoris N-glycosylation pathway to the
Man5GlcNAc2 structure does not affect the yeast’s phy-
siology much and that such engineered strains are fully
capable of producing diverse mammalian glycoproteins
at high levels, with the desired homogenous N-glycosy-
lation. As the Man5GlcNAc2 structure is the starting
point for buildup of mammalian complex-type N-gly-
cans, future studies will address the behaviour of more
extensively engineered strains in high cell density
cultivation.
