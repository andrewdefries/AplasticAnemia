Abstract
Individual variability in xenobiotic metabolism has been associated with susceptibility to developing complex dis-
eases. Genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism have been evaluated in association studies; the difficulty of obtain-
ing accurate gene frequencies in mixed populations makes interpretation of the results difficult. We sought to
estimate population parameters for the cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase gene families, thus contrib-
uting to studies using these genes as markers. We describe the frequencies of six genes (CYP1A1, CYP2D6,
CYP2E1, GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1) and estimate population parameters in 115 Euro-descendants and 196
Afro-descendants from Curitiba, South of Brazil. PCR-based methods were used for genotyping, and statistical anal-
ysis were performed by AMOVA with ARLEQUIN software. The mutant allele frequencies in the Afro-descendants
and Euro-descendants, respectively, were: CYP1A1*2A = 30.1% and 15.2%; CYP2D6*4 = 14.5% and 21.5%;
CYP2E1*5B = 7.9% and 5%; GSTP1*B = 37.8% and 28.3%. The null genotype frequencies were: GSTM1*0 = 36.8%
and 46.1%; GSTT1*0 = 24.2% and 17.4%.
Key words: CYP, GST, population study.

Genetic marker studies assessing individual back-
grounds from specific populations can provide information
on gene flow, evolutionary history, and population disper-
sions, and can also help in the prediction of risks for partic-
ular diseases. Based on these studies, pharmacogenetic data
have shown significant inter- and intra-population differ-
ences in the metabolism, efficiencies, and toxicities of sev-
eral types of drugs. These findings have important implica-
tions for the management and treatment of human diseases
(Kittles and Weiss, 2003).
Many different enzyme families are involved in xeno-
biotic metabolism, including cytochrome P450 (CYPs) in
phase I, as well as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and
N-acetyl-transferases (NATs) in phase II (Autrup, 2000).
Several genes of the CYP family have been studied in many
populations (e.g., Europeans, Africans, Asians, and their
mixed descendants) in case-control studies of complex dis-
eases. With regard to cancers, these studies focus primarily
on lung, breast, and head and neck tumors (Olshan et al.,
2000; Gajecka et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2005; Leichsenring
et al., 2006; Losi-Guembarovski et al., 2008; Torresan et
al., 2008; Varela-Lema et al., 2008).
Variants of GSTs enzymes have been extensively
studied and were found to be associated with several types
of neoplasias in different populations, such as Europeans
and Euro-descendants (Park et al., 2000; Geisler and
Olshan, 2001; Raimondi et al., 2005; Leichsenring et al.,
2006; Losi-Guembarovski et al., 2008; Torresan et al.,
2008), Africans and Afro-descendants (Dandara et al.,
2002; Enokida et al., 2005), and Asians (Yang et al., 2005).
Other studies involving genes of xenobiotic metabolism
have been performed in order to describe the frequency of
the mutant alleles and genotypes in different healthy popu-
lations (Garte et al., 2001; Gaspar et al., 2002; Menoyo et
al., 2006). Some studies carried out in the Brazilian popula-
tion described mutant allele and genotype frequencies in
several regions (Arruda et al., 1998; Gattás and Soares
Viera, 2000; Gaspar et al., 2002; Losi-Guembarovski et al.,
2002; Rossini et al., 2002; Amorim et al., 2004; Gattás et
al., 2004; Hatagima et al., 2004; Kvitko et al., 2006; Ros-
sini et al., 2006).
In the present report, two distinct groups (Euro-des-
cendants and Afro-descendants) from Curitiba in the South
of Brazil were analyzed in order to describe the frequency
of six metabolic genes (CYP1A1, CYP2E1, CYP2D6,
GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1). The group of Euro-descen-
dants was comprised of 115 healthy individuals (49 males

and 66 females) with an average age of 42.6 ± 7.3 years.
The group of Afro-descendants was comprised of 196
healthy individuals (123 males and 73 females) with an av-
erage age of 33.4 ± 8.6 years. The ethnic differentiation
from these groups was determined through a survey with
self-declared information from the individuals that was at-
tached to the Informed Consent agreement. The blood sam-
ples were collected in the Hematology and Hemotherapy
Center of Paraná State (HEMEPAR), a center for blood do-
nation, by the staff of the Immunogenetics and Histocom-
patibility Laboratory (LIGH). Genomic DNA was isolated
from peripheral white blood cells from all individuals and
sampled by a salting out procedure (Bignon and Fernan-
dez-Viña, 1997). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers
were designed according to the Genome Data Bank. The
genotyping of CYP1A1*2A, CYP2D6*4, CYP2E1*5B, and
GSTP1*B was performed by PCR RFLP according to the
following protocols, respectively: Carstensen et al. (1993),
Sobtia et al. (2005), Kato et al. (1992), and Harries et al.
(1997). GSTM1*0 and GSTT1*0 genotyping was per-
formed by PCR multiplex according to the protocol de-
scribed by Abdel-Rahman et al. (1996).
The allele frequencies of the CYP1A1*2A,
CYP2D6*4, CYP2E*5B, GSTP1*B and the null genotypes
GSTM1*0 and GSTT1*0 were obtained by direct counting.
The Chi-square test was used to: 1) compare the frequen-
cies of dominant and recessive genotypes of the genes
GSTM1*0 and GSTT1*0 in individuals of the Euro and
Afro-descendant groups, 2) verify whether the genes
CYP1A1*2A, CYP2D6*4, CYP2E*5B, and GSTP1*B were
in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), and 3) compare
the frequencies of the mutant allele of these genes and the
genotypes GSTM1*0 and GSTT1*0 with published data.
The frequencies of CYP1A1*2A, CYP2D6*4, CYP2E*5B,
and GSTP1*B, genotyped in 311 unrelated persons (622
chromosomes) in both samples, were compared via the
analysis of the molecular variance (ARLEQUIN 3.1) ac-
cording to Excoffier et al. (1992). The fixation index (Fst)
was estimated for the entire sample.
The two groups studied were in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium with regard to genotype frequencies of the
genes CYP1A1*2A, CYP2D6*4, CYP2E*5B and
GSTP1*B. The mutant allele and null genotype frequencies
found in the present study were compared with others de-
scribed in the literature from both non-Brazilian and Brazil-
ian populations (data presented in Tables 1 and 2). When
our data were compared with literature data from non-
Brazilian Afro-descendants, the frequencies of individuals
with mutant alleles for the genes CYP2D6*4, GSTP1*B
and null genotype GSTM1*0 were not homogeneously dis-
tributed between the populations of this study (Table 1).
We believe that this discrepancy is due to the different
methods used for the classification of ethnic origin among
research groups, in spite of the parental population from
North and South America may have different gene frequen-
cies. In this sense is important to notice that the partial c2
values from our sample were the main responsible for the
observed significance. On the other hand, the frequencies
of individuals with mutant alleles and null genotypes
(GSTM1*0 and GSTT1*0) for the genes studied were ho-
mogeneously distributed between populations when the
non-Brazilian Europeans and Euro-descendants were con-
sidered (Table 1). The frequencies of individuals with mu-
tant alleles and null genotypes in Brazil, both for Afro-and
Euro-descendants were homogeneously distributed
(Table 2).
In the comparison of our groups we noticed that there
was a homogeneous distribution of the frequency of the ge-
notypes GSTM1*0 and GSTT1*0 between the Afro-descen-
dants and Euro-descendants; the differences of the frequen-
cies of individuals with dominant and recessive genotypes,
respectively, were statistically not significant (c2
1 = 2.52;
p ± 0.10 and c2
1 = 1.97; p > 0.10). The analysis of molecular
variance (AMOVA) for the genes CYP1A1*2A,
CYP2D6*4, CYP2E1*5B, and GSTP1*B showed that
97.47% of the component of genetic variance is present
within the ethnic groups and 2.53% (p < 10-4
) between
them. This lower value justify the lower value of the fixa-
tion index or co-ancestry coefficient (Fst = 0.02508 and
0.02565 for Afro- and Euro-descendants, respectively, and
0.02529 for the entire group) observed in this study. Fst, is
computed as a measure of the population division effect
and values up to 0.05 indicate negligible genetic differenti-
ation (Adeyemo et al., 2005).
Biometabolism genes have been widely used in asso-
ciation studies, and they have contributed to the improve-
ment in understanding the genetic basis of quantitative
features (e.g., susceptibility to complex diseases and drug
response). Such studies must consider the impact of the
population stratification and miscegenation degree of the
control population (Ardlie et al., 2002; Freedman et al.,
2004) in order to prevent false associations (Zembrzuski et
al., 2006). When genes with ethnic variation frequencies
are evaluated in association studies (especially in complex
diseases with multiple environmental and genetic factors),
the high-risk group may present a low prevalence of the
high-risk allele if other genetic or environmental risk fac-
tors predominate in that group (Ziv and Burchard, 2003).
The present report provides data that can contribute to
the general profile of frequency and population dynamics
of biometabolizing genes in groups of the Southern Brazil-
ian population. These data constitute a valuable resource
for the planning of future association studies in complex
diseases like cancers.
