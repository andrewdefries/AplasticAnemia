It is well known that during the acute phase of certain viral infections in man, such as
measles (1) and influenza (2), a marked degree ofimmunological unresponsiveness exists,
particularly m cell-mediated immunity. Recent studies on effects of viruses on in vitro
responses of lymphocytes to antigens and mitogens strengthen the view that viruses can
influence lymphocyte functions and indicate that specific viruses may affect selected
classes of lymphoid cells such as T cells (3, 4), monocytes (5, 6), or B cells (7-9) (reviewed
in references 10-13). These findings suggest that it might be possible, by appropriate
choice of virus and experimental conditions, to harness the immunosuppressive capacity
of viruses in an effort to develop a selective strategy for diminishing specific immune
responses found to be clinically harmful. One such untoward response, the graft-vs.-host
reaction, is reported to occur in 70% ofrecipients ofhuman bone marrow transplants, and
is a serious impediment to effective clinical treatment of immunodeficiency syndromes,
aplastic anemias, and leukemias (14).
The present work represents an attempt to suppress graft-vs.-host reactions m an
experimental model using viruses The basis for this approach derives from the observa-
tions that while resting lymphocytes are not permissive for a var:ety of RNA viruses,
activated lymphocytes are capable ofreplicating viruses and may be killed by them in the
process. This serves as the basis for a virus plaque assay for enumerating antigen-
sensitive lymphocytes, by infecting lymphocytes stimulated by a variety of antigens or
m:togens and determining the number of cells capable of preducmg infectious centers
(15) The virus chosen for the studies is vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), 1a relatively
nonpathogenic agent for man although mice are extremely susceptible to it. In previous
:n vitro studies it has been demonstrated that production of vesicular stomatitis wrus
occurred selectively in activated T lymphocytes rather than activated B lymphocytes in
mouse and m man (3, 16).
More recent studies indicate that resting primary lymphocytes in fact may be
infected by VSV, although they are unable to permit replication of the virus.
When such infected cells are subsequently stimulated, the virus is somehow

activated leading to death of the stimulated cell. This has resulted, for example,
in a greater than 99% suppression of thymidine incorporation by lymphocytes
cultured with allogeneic mitomycin C-treated cells in mixed lymphocyte cul-
tures. The precise requirements for establishing a latent or persistent infection
by VSV in primary lymphocytes remain to be established. Nevertheless these
observations suggested the possibility that histoincompatible lymphoid cells
might be infected with VSV, transferred into allogeneic hosts such that activa-
tion of the infected T lymphocytes in the course of initiating a graft-vs.-host
(GVH) reaction might result in the selective destruction of the responding cells.
The present studies are aimed at testing the possibility that such a strategy may
diminish GVH reactions in the mouse.
Materials and Methods
Mice and V~rus. Young adult male A, C57L, and their F~ hybrids, LAF1 mice were obtained
from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine. The stock of VSV, Indiana strain, was
prepared in secondary chick embryo cells as described (17). The titer was 108plaque-forming units
(PFU)/ml as titrated on mouse L cells
Inductmn of GVH Reaction. Peripheral lymph nodes (LN; i.e. axillary, mesentemc, and in-
guinal) were obtained from young adult A, C57L, or LAFI mice Cell suspensions were prepared in
Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and washed. 5 x 10e LN cells were rejected intravenously
into LAF~ mice 1 day after or on the day of 950 R whole body ~/-irradiation (1sTcs ~,-source,
Gammator M; Radiation International, Parsippany, N. J.). In some experiments the parental cells
(107/ml) were incubated before injection with VSV (2-2.5 x 108 PFU/ml) for 2 h at 37°C in HBSS
containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were then washed three times with or without a
subsequent addlhon of 0 02 ml guinea pig anh-VSV, an amount sufficient to neutralize all input
virus (serum titer > 1.10,000). In other experiments, 108 PFU of VSV were injected directly into
the recipient mice at various times after the injection of5 × 10eparental LN cells. Preincubation of
parental cells with mitomycin C (obtained through the courtesy of the Drug Development Branch,
Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md.) was performed by
incubation of 107 cells/ml with 100 ~g mitomycin (Mit.)/ml for 30 rain at 37°C followed by three
washings of the cells. For some experiments, it was necessary to Incubate LN cells with anti-Thy
1.2 before injection. Anti-Thy 1.2 was prepared as described (18), and the conditions of the
incubation were: 3.3 × 106 cells/ml, antl-Thy 1.2, 1/60; and rabbit complement (C), 1/45; 45 minutes
at 37°C.
GVH Assay A modification (19) of the method of Sprent and Miller (20) was used as described.
All mice received an intraperltoneal injection of 25 ~C1 ZH-thymidine (SliT; 0.36 Ci/mmol;
Schwarz/Mann Div., Becton, Dickinson & Co, Orangeburg, N. Y.) 2 h before death, on days 3 and
4 after parental cell injection Mice were killed and their spleens removed. Individual spleens were
quickly teased m ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, placed m tubes, and centri-
fuged at 1,200 rpm at 4°C for 10 mln. The cells were resuspended and incubated for 2-5 min at 37°C
in Tris-buffered lsotomc ammonium chloride as described (19, 21) After two addihonal washings
m PBS the cells were resuspended m 2 ml of 10% TCA and left for 18 h at 4°C. The centrifuged
precipitates of each tube were dissolved in i ml of Nuclear-Chicago Solubilizer (NCS; Amersham/
Searle Corp, Arlington Heights, Ill.) and transferred to scintillation vials containing 10 ml of a
toluene base 1,4-bis[2-(5-phenyloxazolyl)]benzene-scmtlltation fluid. Radioactivity was deter-
mined by B-counting m a Packard series 3003 Tri-Carb liquid scintillation spectrometer (Packard
Instrument Co., Inc, Downers Grove, Ill.).
Fate of Labeled Cells. Parental LN cells (5 × 107/ml) were labeled with 5~Cr (sodium chromate
solution; Amersham/Searle Corp.) at 100 ~C1/ml for 45 rain at 37°C in HBSS containing 5% fetal
calf serum. After washing the cells three times, a portion of the cell preparation was incubated
with VSV as above. 107 cells containing 3.2-5.9 × 105 cpm were then injected intravenously into
LAF~ mice irradiated on the previous day with 950 R whole body ~/-irradiation. On days 1 and 3
postlnjection, recipients were exsanguinated and portions of peripheral blood, spleen, hver, lung,
and peripheral LN were excised and weighed. 5~Cr-containing cells and tissues were counted in a

Results
Inhibition of GVH Reactivity of Parental Cells by VSV. Irradiated LAF~
mice were injected intravenously with 5 × 106 syngeneic or parental LN cells. 3
days after cell injection, a marked DNA synthetic response was observed in the
spleens of mice injected with parental cells, much higher than after injection of
syngeneic cells (Table I). Previous studies have shown, in fact, that syngeneic
cells do not usually cause a significant increase of 3HT incorporation over that
observed in uninjected control mice and that treatment of parental LN cells with
anti-Thy 1.2 plus C brings the level of 3HT incorporation down to that seen with
syngeneic cells (19). Treatment of parental cells with Mit., that is known to
inhibit DNA synthesis (22), also prevents the splenic proliferative response (19).
When recipients of 5 × 106 A (exp. 1, Table I) or C57L (exps. 2 and 3, Table I)
were simultaneously injected with 1.25 × 106 PFU of VSV intravenously, the
resulting GVH activity as measured by ZHT incorporation on day 3 was virtually
completely inhibited. Recipients injected with VSV 1 or 2 days after parental cell
injection still showed a much reduced response, even though the assay was
performed on day 3. Since previous studies clearly showed that a detectable
proliferative response is present on day 2 (19) this indicates that the virus
eradicated an already initiated response. Thus, injection of VSV inhibits the
GVH reaction as detected by the spleen assay.
Because preinfection of lymphocytes was able to block subsequent prolifera-
tion in mixed lymphocyte cultures (reference 13 and unpublished observations),
we attempted to block the GVH reaction by infecting the parental LN cells in
vitro before transferring them to F~ recipients. The cells were infected at a
multiplicity of infection (mot) of 20-25 for 2 h at 37°C and washed three times
before injection. Such preinfected cells failed to generate GVH parental cell

proliferative activity (Table II). The degree of inhibition in exps. 4, 5, and 6
actually amounted to 92, 96, and 85%, respectively. It could be argued that free
virus particles were in the injected cell suspensions despite the extensive wash-
ing of the cells and that it was this free virus rather than lymphocyte-associated
virus that was inhibiting the GVH. To eliminate free infectious virus particles
in the inoculum the cells were incubated for an additional h at 4°C with 1/200
guinea pig anti-VSV serum, a concentration sufficient to neutralize all input
virus particles. After cells so treated were injected into recipients, the GVH was
still markedly suppressed (76% in exp. 4, 83% in exp. 6, and 89% in exp. 7).
Specificity of VSV Immunosuppression. It has been shown that VSV can
inhibit lymphocyte activation induced in vitro by concanavalin A or by the
mixed lymphocyte reaction, but not the one induced by lipopolysaccharide (3),
suggesting a predilection of VSV for T cells. To study further this apparent
inability of VSV to act on non-T cells, F1 bone marrow cells (107 per recipient),
with or without preincubation with VSV, were injected into lethally irradiated
syngeneic recipients and the degree of proliferation in the spleen measured 3
days after cell injection. In neither exp. 4 nor exp. 5 (Table II) was a significant
reduction in proliferation seen after incubation with the virus (Student's t test:
0.1 <P <0.2inexp. 4and0.5<P <0.6inexp. 5).
It was found previously that in GVH reactions intravenous injection of a
mixture of mitomycin C-treated parental LN and anti-Thy 1.2-treated F1 LN
gave a good proliferative response while neither cell type alone synthesized
DNA in appreciable amounts (19). This phenomenon is again demonstrated in
Table III. While neither 5 × l0s syngeneic LN, whether anti-Thy 1.2-treated or
not, nor 5 × 10e Mit.-treated parental LN injected alone resulted in a high
incorporation of 3HT by day 3, the simultaneous injection of both cell types gave
a much higher response (approximately 35 and 59% of the response seen with
untreated parental cells). As was also previously determined, the LAF1 non-T
cells made up the bulk of this syngeneic LN proliferation (19). It should be noted

that incubation of the anti-Thy 1.2-treated F, LN cells with VSV followed by
washing stillallowed them to be recruited by Mit.-treated parental cells(exps. 8
and 9, Table III)although the 3HT incorporation was about half the amount seen
without VSV incubation of the F, cells.This suggested that the non-T elements
were relatively insensitive to the action of VSV, and certainly much less
sensitive than the parental T cellssince their activity was totally abolished by
the same amount of virus (3-4% ofthe response remaining). Itwas of additional
interest to note that Mit.-treated parental LN cells which had been preincu-
bated with VSV were no longer capable of recruiting F, B cells into prolifera-
tion. It appears that the VSV incubation has an even more drastic inhibitory
effect on the T cellsthan Mit. treatment.
Effect of Preincubation with VSV on the Subsequent Homing of Parental LN
Cells in F, Hosts. A possible criticism of the conclusion that VSV suppresses
GVH is that the virus might alter the homing pattern and organ distribution of
parental LN cells, thereby reducing the number of parental cells in the spleens
of recipients (23). Thus, the low 3HT incorporation in the recipients' spleens
could be due to a failure of parental LN to home to spleen instead of an actual
destruction of reactive allogeneic T blasts by VSV. To differentiate between
these possibilities, experiments were performed to examine the effect, if any, of
preincubation with VSV on the fate of injected cells. Parental LN cells were

incubated with VSV (moi 25) as usual. After washing, the cells were intrave-
nously injected and organs were removed 1 and 3 days later. VSV pretreatment
did not cause any reduction in the amount of T-radioactivity present in the
spleen at either time after cell injection (Table IV). It should be noted that a
decrease of as much as 12% (24), which is the percentage of parental cells
estimated to respond against F1 hybrids in the rat and which would have been
destroyed by VSV which infects responding cells, would not be detected in this
type of experiment.
Discussion
The present results demonstrate that VSV infection under appropriate condi-
tions is capable of inhibiting the proliferative phase of the GVH response in
mice. Further, they confirm previous observations made in vitro (3, 16) that
VSV affects primarily T lymphocytes, and indicate that cells preinfected in vitro
are killed by the virus when they are activated against alloantigens in vivo. The
relative resistance of non-T-cell responses and of hematopoietic cells is borne out
by the lack of inhibitory effect of VSV on their proliferation. The B-cell nature of
the resistant recruited cell was established in previous work (19). It is interest-
ing to note, however, that the inhibition of the T-cell response by VSV in the
present studies included an abolition of the recruiting ability of these cells as
well. This might have been expected in view of the fact that VSV rapidly
inhibits host cell macromolecular synthesis upon activation (25-27) and this
would prevent production of a factor responsible for the recruitment of B cells.
No such inhibition is seen when T cells are inhibited merely from proliferating
by mitomycin treatment and can also induce delayed hypersensitivity reactions
(28). In vivo injection of VSV or in vitro treatment by VSV before injection of T
cells appears to lead to a total abolition of both T-cell proliferation and T-cell-
induced responses.
It is of obvious interest to attempt to apply this information to the prevention
or treatment of secondary disease in vivo caused by allogeneic or semiallogeneic
672 VIRAL IMMUNOSUPPRESSION OF THE GRAFT-VS.-HOST REACTION
spleen or bone marrow transplants in irradiated hosts. While preinfection with
VSV can abrogate the reactivity of T cells, the obvious consequence in the
immunologically compromised host would be a viremia and possibly viral dis-
ease. Thus development of this strategy for treatment of humans would require
protection of the host against the consequences of virus infection. Two possibili-
ties for avoiding this complication are envisioned. First, the host could be
protected against VSV by treatment with anti-VSV serum. Preliminary find-
ings (to be published) suggest that suppression of spleen-induced secondary
disease can indeed be effected by prior incubation of the parental spleen cells
with VSV, and that the recipients survive if they are protected from dissemi-
nated virus infection by treatment with anti-VSV antibody. The present results
with anti-VSV antibody incubation before injection of VSV-infected cells also
suggest that virus had been adsorbed and penetrated into the T cells and could
no longer be inhibited from exercising its lytic effect on these cells by anti-VSV.
A second possibility would be to employ temperature-sensitive mutants of the
virus which would be capable of killing the T cells at a nonpermissive tempera-
ture (37°C) without producing infectious virus, as appears to be the case for
certain tissue culture cells (29). Preliminary data indicate this to be possible
with at least two ts mutants of VSV in human lymphocytes (to be published).
In in vitro studies on suppression of mixed lymphocyte cultures it has become
clear that not all preparations of VSV are effective in establishing latent or
persistent infections in lymphocytes. Preliminary evidence suggests that defec-
tive interfering virus particles may play an important role. It will be important,
therefore, to establish the optimal conditions for infecting normal lymphocytes
to achieve maximal selective immunosuppression upon later stimulation.
Woodruffand Woodrufffound that Newcastle disease virus (NDV), another T-
cell specific virus (12), inhibited skin graft rejection in mice (30) but the effect
was only transient in spite of daily injections of virus. These authors suggested
that the effect might be caused by a change in surface structure of the lympho-
cytes which temporarily altered their normal migration pattern in the host (23,
31). It is also possible that during the course of skin graft rejection the recipients
produced antibodies ~o the virus and neutralized its effects.2 In the present
studies, VSV-infected cells showed an undiminished tendency to accumulate in
the spleens of host mice although their proliferation was inhibited. Similarly
McFarland (4) has found that infection of mice with measles virus selectively
inhibits the T-cell helper response, thus reinforcing the impression that selec-
tive T-cell responses may be abrogated by certain viral infections in vivo.
There remain a number of problems to be explored in this model. It will be
important to establish the degree to which B-cell function is restored in the
recipients, particularly in terms of thymus-dependent and thymus-independent
antibody responses. Similarly, it will be of interest to ascertain the degree to

which T-cell reconstitution of the allogeneic spleen occurs, and whether any
helper activity, proliferating activity, or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity can be
developed to unrelated antigens. Finally, the duration of the immunosuppres-
sion of GVH reactions in animals protected against the effects of infectious virus
will be important to determine, in order to learn whether this strategy is
effective only against acute GVH reactions or may also diminish the chronic
manifestations as well.
Summary
Graft-vs.-host (GVH) reactivity of parental lymph node (LN) cells was as-
sayed by measurements of 3H-thymidine incorporation in vivo in spleens of
irradiated F~ recipients. Preincubation of parental LN cells with vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV) for 2 h at 37°C followed by washing resulted in an 85-90%
reduction in splenic radioactivity, as did injection of VSV on days 0-2 after
recipients received untreated parental LN cells. In contrast, 3H-thymidine
incorporation in the spleens or irradiated F~ hosts was not affected by VSV when
F~ bone marrow cells were incubated with the virus. In addition, preincubation
of F1 B cells with VSV still allowed these syngeneic B cells to be recruited into
proliferation by mitomycin-treated parental LN cells. The inhibitory effect of
VSV, thus, seems to be specific for T-cell proliferation. These observations
suggest that viral immunosuppression might be capable of being developed into
a useful strategy for selective deletion of lymphocytes capable of reacting
against histocompatibility antigens and initiating GVH reactions.
