Abstract
Background: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for asthma have been successful in identifying
novel associations which have been well replicated. The aim of this study is to identify the genetic variants that
influence predisposition towards asthma in an ethnic Chinese population in Singapore using a GWAS approach.
Methods: A two-stage GWAS was performed in case samples with allergic asthma, and in control samples without
asthma and atopy. In the discovery stage, 490 case and 490 control samples were analysed by pooled genotyping.
Significant associations from the first stage were evaluated in a replication cohort of 521 case and 524 control
samples in the second stage. The same 980 samples used in the discovery phase were also individually genotyped
for purposes of a combined analysis. An additional 1445 non-asthmatic atopic control samples were also
genotyped.
Results: 19 promising SNPs which passed our genome-wide P value threshold of 5.52 × 10-8
were individually
genotyped. In the combined analysis of 1011 case and 1014 control samples, SNP rs2941504 in PERLD1 on
chromosome 17q12 was found to be significantly associated with asthma at the genotypic level (P = 1.48 × 10-6
,
ORAG = 0.526 (0.369-0.700), ORAA = 0.480 (0.361-0.639)) and at the allelic level (P = 9.56 × 10-6
, OR = 0.745 (0.654-
0.848)). These findings were found to be replicated in 3 other asthma GWAS studies, thus validating our own
results. Analysis against the atopy control samples suggested that the SNP was associated with allergic asthma and
not to either the asthma or allergy components. Genotyping of additional SNPs in 100 kb flanking rs2941504
further confirmed that the association was indeed to PERLD1. PERLD1 is involved in the modification of the
glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors for cell surface markers such as CD48 and CD59 which are known to play
multiple roles in T-cell activation and proliferation.
Conclusions: These findings reveal the association of a PERLD1 as a novel asthma candidate gene and reinforce
the involvement of genes on the 17q12-21 chromosomal region in the etiology of asthma.
Background
Asthma is a highly complex disease of airway inflamma-
tion. The intricacies of asthma are exemplified in its
diverse clinical characteristics in terms of its triggers,
symptoms and presentation, as well as how the disease
is understood at the molecular level. More than 180
genes have been found to be associated with
asthma [1-3]. Recent genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) for asthma have identified novel genes such as
ORMDL3 [4], CHI3L1 [5] and DENND1B [6], and
chromosomal regions such as 9q21.31 [7]. These as well
as other known associations to genes PDE4D [8],
TGFB1, IL1RL1, IL18R1, DPP10 [9], and regions of the
highly replicated 5q31-33 and HLA gene clusters [10,11]
have also been confirmed by other GWAS and meta-
analyses of GWAS for asthma [12,13]. The identification
of many of these novel asthma candidates has widened
the scope of possible mechanisms involved in its etiol-
ogy. The premise that genome-wide association studies
when used as tools to elucidate the genetic variants
associated with complex genetic diseases, will lead to
greater understanding of the underlying biology is being
exemplified in studies on asthma.

Pooled GWAS have been used as an alternative to
large-scale GWAS, especially when performed as part of
a two-stage study design to retain sufficient power to
detect association in a particular sample size [14]. Since
2007, at least 15 separate pooled GWAS have shown
significantly reasonable successes in identifying candi-
date genes for complex diseases such as autism [15],
schizophrenia [16] and atopy [17]. We have also pre-
viously shown that pooled genotyping on the Affymetrix
SNP6.0 platform is sufficiently accurate and reliable in a
case-control study design [18].
In this study, we have carried out a two-stage GWAS
using pooled genotyping in the discovery stage which
we followed up with individual genotyping in a replica-
tion sample set to replicate the associated signals (Figure
1). Additional genotyping was performed using the case
and control samples used in the pools as well as in
atopy control samples.
Methods
Samples
The case and control DNA samples used in this study
were part of a larger cross-sectional epidemiological col-
lection of unrelated adult ethnic Chinese students in the
National University of Singapore who were recruited fol-
lowing standard protocols for written informed consent,
over the span of four years. We have previously shown
that there is negligible population stratification in
samples from our study population [19]. Approval to
conduct the study was obtained from the National Uni-
versity of Singapore Institutional Review Board (NUS-
IRB Reference Code: 07-023 and NUS10-343). Recruit-
ment was performed in compliance with the Helsinki
Declaration.
Genomic DNA was extracted from buccal cells
obtained from a mouthwash in 0.9% saline solution. In
short, the buccal cells were pelleted and lysed; DNA was
extracted using the phenol-chloroform phase-separation
technique [20], purified by two washes in ethanol, with
the DNA pellet resuspended in reduced Tris-EDTA buf-
fer. The quality of the genomic DNA samples was
assessed by gel electrophoresis and through the mea-
surement of light absorption at 260 and 230 nm wave-
lengths. Samples were also quantified in quintuplicate
using the PicoGreen (Molecular Probes Inc. Eugene,
Oregon) dsDNA quantification reagent. We have also
previously shown that these buccal cell-derived genomic
DNA samples were amenable to Sanger sequencing [21]
and individual genome-wide analysis on the Illumina
and Affymetrix platforms [19].
Samples were subsequently stratified into case and
control groups according to their disease status based
on an International Study of Asthma and Allergies in
Childhood (ISAAC)-derived survey questionnaire [22]
and doctor-diagnosis. A skin-prick test for common
local allergens in Singapore (Dermatophagoides
Figure 1 Two-stage study design. Four pools (A-D) of a total of 490 case and 490 control samples were created and subjected to a GWAS in
the discovery phase. Each case-control pool set generated a list of SNPs passing the Bonferroni-corrected cut-off. 19 SNPs which consistently
appeared in multiple lists were short-listed for replication. Following individual genotyping in 521 case and 524 control samples, 2 SNPs
remained significantly associated. These SNPs were subsequently genotyped in the 490 case and 490 control samples to make up a total of 1011
case and 1014 control samples. An additional 1445 atopy control samples were also genotyped.

pteronyssinus, Blomia tropicalis, Elaeis guineensis and
Curvularia lunata) was also performed as a measure of
their atopic status. We have previously shown that skin-
prick reactivity to dust mites Blomia tropicalis and Der-
matophagoides pteronyssinus were highly sensitive and
specific indicators for allergic sensitization in Singa-
pore [23]. Cases were defined as having asthma by a
positive response to the question “Have you ever had
asthma?”, a doctor’s diagnosis and a positive skin prick
reaction (wheal diameter ≥ 3 mm) to either one of the
dust mite allergens. In our sampling frame, 17% of the
samples were considered to be cases. Conversely, a con-
trol answered “No” to the above question, did not have
any symptoms of asthma and also showed no positive
skin prick reactions to any of the allergens evaluated.
About 17% of the sampled individuals were controls. A
subset of the individuals completed lung function and
peak flow reversibility test, as well as a complete physi-
cians’ assessment for asthma (data not shown). This is
done to cross validate our diagnosis as well as classifica-
tion of cases and controls. A third category of indivi-
duals without any symptoms of asthma or diagnosis but
with positive skin-prick responses were selected as ato-
pic controls. Table 1 summarizes the demographics of
the population used in this study.
Pooling
As our cross-sectional sampling was performed in var-
ious stages over a four year period, at the time we car-
ried out the GWAS, a total of 980 case and control
samples were available for genotyping. These samples
were selected for pooling because they fell within a 5%
error margin in the replicate measurements by Pico-
Green. 100 ng from each DNA sample was pooled
together. Pooled DNA samples were re-quantified by
PicoGreen to ensure accuracy of pooling. Four pools of
varying size (from 90-160 samples per pool) were cre-
ated leading up to 490 samples for each study group.
Pooled GWAS
Genotyping of the pooled DNA samples on the Affyme-
trix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix.
Santa Carla, California) platform was outsourced to a
local service provider (Origen Laboratories Pte Ltd) in
Singapore. Each of the eight pooled samples was geno-
typed in triplicate, resulting in the use of 24 microarray
chips to genotype 490 case and 490 control samples.
Allelotyping for pooled genotyping
Allele frequencies for the 906,600 SNPs on the Affyme-
trix SNP6.0 chip were estimated from probe intensities
using the polynomial-based probe specific correction
(PPC) [24] as previously described [18].
Individual genotyping for replication
Genomic DNA samples were diluted to 50 ng/μl prior
to being outsourced to the DNA Sequencing and Geno-
mics Facility at the University of Utah for individual
genotyping on the Illumina BeadXpress platform using
the GoldenGate assay (Illumina, Inc. San Diego, Califor-
nia) and to the SNP Research Facility at the Washington
University in St Louis for genotyping on the Sequenom
platform using the MassARRAY iPlex assay (Sequenom,
Inc. San Diego, California). An additional 521 case and
524 control samples (together with the initial 490 case
and 490 control samples making up a total of 1011
cases and 1014 controls) were individually genotyped to
replicate the observed associations from the discovery
stage. An additional 1445 atopic samples without
asthma were also genotyped (Table 1).
Statistical analysis
Association analysis using the estimated allele frequen-
cies from the pooled genotyping was performed in
R [25] via a Z test and by generating a single-tail P
value for significance.
The genotypes obtained in the replication stage were
analysed using PLINK v1.07 [26] using the full model
association tests (–model) and via Fisher’s exact test
(–fisher). This permitted us to test for association under
the general, multiplicative, additive dominant and reces-
sive genetic models [27]. P values from the tests for
association under the different models are presented as
Pgeneral, Pmultiplicative, Padditive, Pdominant and Precessive.

Pgeneral and Pmultiplicative refer to the P values obtained
from a Fisher’s test performed on the genotype and
allele counts respectively in cases and controls. Padditive
refers to the P value obtained from a Cochran Armitage
Trend test for allele counts in cases and controls. Pdomi-
nant refers to the P values obtained from a Fisher’s test
on the pooled genotype counts of the homozygous
minor and heterozygous genotypes against the homozy-
gous major genotype. Precessive refers to the P value from
a Fisher’s test on the genotype counts of the homozy-
gous minor against the pooled counts of the heterozy-
gous and homozygous major genotypes. Odds ratios are
presented with the 95% confidence interval in parenth-
eses. As we did not have any assumptions on the nature
of the genetic association, association was tested for all
the genetic models. However, only the general and mul-
tiplicative models were considered for determining
whether an association was positive (or not). SNP call
rates (–missing) and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
(–hardy) were also determined as quality control
measures.
Functional prediction of variants
The functional characteristics of tested SNPs were
determined through the use of the online database F-
SNP [28]. Splicing regulation sites were predicted using
Human Splicing Finder [29].
Results
Pooled GWAS
In this study, a pooled GWAS was performed on 490
cases and 490 controls on the Affymetrix SNP6.0 plat-
form (Table 1). Cases were defined as atopic individuals
who have ever had asthma, while controls were neither
atopic nor have ever had symptoms of asthma. As only
ethnic Chinese individuals were selected to participate
in this study, there was no bias or stratification based
on ethnicity. Secondly, as the study samples were
sourced from a cross-sectional sampling frame, selection
bias was also avoided. We have also previously high-
lighted that our study population was notably similar to
the Han Chinese population in Hapmap (CHB) and that
there was negligible population stratification within sam-
ples from our cross-sectional epidemiological
collection [19].
Four pools (A-D in Figure 1) were created within
each study group, and each pool was genotyped in tri-
plicate to account for potential errors due to pooled
genotyping. SNP call rates were better than 96% while
the concordance of probe intensities across replicates
was higher than 97.5%. We have previously shown that
estimated allele frequencies from pooled genotyping on
the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 platform were highly compar-
able to actual allele frequencies obtained from
individual genotyping on the same platform [18]. Esti-
mated allele frequencies for SNPs were calculated from
the measured probe intensities. The allele frequency
estimates were averaged across the three replicates in
each of the 4 pairs of case and control groups. These
averaged estimated allele frequencies were compared
between the study groups via a Z-test to generate 4
sets of P values.
Of the 906,600 SNPs on the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array,
185,875 non-variable and 37,376 non-autosomal SNPs
SNPs were discarded. The remaining 683,349 SNPs
were sorted according to their P values to generate 4
SNP lists. As these P values were solely used to rank the
SNPs for replication and weren’t considered to be indi-
cative of the strength of association, SNPs were selected
for further study using a standard Bonferroni P value
cut-off of 5.52 × 10-8
(a = 0.05 divided by 906,600
SNPs). Furthermore, as only estimated allele frequencies
were available, the obtained P values could merely be
considered indicative of association in a multiplicative
allelic model. Common SNPs (> 5% based on Hapmap
CHB) which were ranked below this cut-off were short
listed from the 4 case-control comparisons. 19 SNPs
were found to consistently appear in at least 2 of these
SNP lists; 18 of which were consistently ranked below
the cut-off in two case-control comparisons while 1 in
three case-control comparisons (Table 2). These 19
SNPs were shortlisted for replication.
Replication
These 19 SNPs were individually genotyped in 1045
samples consisting of 521 case and 524 control samples
(Table 1) in the replication stage. Genotyping success
rate was more than 97% for all SNPs. None of the geno-
typed SNPs showed any major deviation (P value < 1 ×
10-3
) from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. Association
with asthma was tested under the general and multipli-
cative genetic models [27] to account for the genotypic
and allelic effect of these 19 SNPs (Table 3). Since the
gender ratio was skewed in our sample set, we tested
for any gender-related effects by performing the associa-
tion tests in male and female samples separately. No
gender-specific associations were found (data not
shown).
After accounting for multiple testing, one SNP was
found to be significant with a P value less than the Bon-
ferroni-corrected value of 2.63 × 10-3
(0.05/19 SNPs).
This SNP (rs2941504) falls within the gene PERLD1 on
chromosome 17q12 and is coding synonymous. It
showed positive association to asthma in the replication
stage (Pgeneral = 2.60 × 10-3
). While the minor G allele
was present at a lower frequency in cases (MAFcase =
0.305) than in controls (MAFcontrol = 0.359) with an
odds ratio of 0.784 (0.653-0.941), it was not significantly

associated at the allelic level (Pmultiplicative = 9.26 × 10-3
)
after accounting for multiple testing.
The SNP rs2941504 was subsequently genotyped in
the 490 case and 490 control samples used in the
discovery phase, to improve on the sample numbers and
in an attempt to obtain genotype data to perform a
combined analysis. This permitted association testing in
a total of 1011 case and 1014 control samples. Given

this sample size, the frequency of the minor allele in our
genotyped population (MAF = 0.350), the prevalence of
asthma in our cross-sectional sampling frame (17%), and
a genome-wide significance level (a = 5 × 10-8
), we had
80% power, based on joint analysis in a two-staged
study design [30], to detect associations with odds ratios
greater than 1.4 [31]. While either one of the stages of
our study would not have been individually sufficiently
powered, the combined analysis from both stages did
have sufficient power to say that the discovered associa-
tions were indeed true.
The coding SNP, rs2941504, in the PERLD1 gene
showed strong association (Pgeneral = 1.48 × 10-6
) to
asthma (Table 4) in the combined analysis. The genoty-
pic odds ratio of the minor GG genotype as the refer-
ence revealed that it had a moderate effect of between
0.480 and 0.526 over the AA and AG genotypes respec-
tively. The presence of the minor G allele at a signifi-
cantly (Pmultiplicative = 9.56 × 10-6
) higher frequency in
controls than in cases (MAFcontrols = 0.381, MAFcases =
0.315) suggested that it conferred some protection
against asthma (OR: 0.745 (0.654-0.848)). The effect of
the minor allele is seen more pronounced in the reces-
sive genetic model with a Precessive value of 4.34 × 10-7
with odds ratio of 0.503 (0.384-0.658). As there was no
major deviation from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium, the
allelic association as tested by a Cochran-Armitage
trend test generated a P value (Padditive = 1.25 × 10-5
)
which was similar to that obtained from a Fisher’s test
on the allele counts.
Localizing the association signal
To confirm that this association on 17q12 was indeed at
PERLD1 and not at other adjacent genes, tagging was
performed in the 100 kb flanking SNP rs2941504 to
identify additional SNPs for genotyping. Tagging per-
formed using the Hapmap CHB population as a refer-
ence with r2
and MAF cut-offs of 0.8 and 0.05
respectively gave 7 SNPs (including rs2941504) to repre-
sent the region. The 6 additional SNPs were genotyped
across 1011 case and 1014 controls (Table 4). After
accounting for multiple testing, SNPs rs1877031 on
STARD3 and rs1058808 on ERBB2 were found to have
P values less than 8.33 × 10-3
(0.05/6 SNPs). To deter-
mine whether these additional associations were influ-
enced by the strong linkage disequilibrium in the region
to PERLD1 (Figure 2), logistic regression using SNP
rs2941504 as a covariate was performed in PLINK
(–logistic –condition). None of the SNPs remained sig-
nificant in the regression analysis (Table 4). This con-
firmed that genome-wide association signal at 17q12
was indeed due to PERLD1, and not any other gene in
the region.
Genotyping of Atopic Controls
The SNP rs2941504 was also genotyped in an additional
1445 atopic individuals without asthma (Table 1). To
study the effect this SNP had on asthma without consid-
ering the effects of atopy, association was tested between
the 1011 case and 1445 atopy control samples. Associa-
tion was detected at the genotypic (Pgeneral = 2.25 × 10-
2
) and allelic (Pmultiplicative = 6.97 × 10-3
) level with an
allelic odds ratio of 0.845 (0.747-0.954). Similarly, the
effect this SNP had at the level of atopy was also mea-
sured by testing for association between 1445 atopy con-
trols and 1014 non-asthmatic non-atopic controls.
Positive association was detected at the genotypic (Pgen-
eral = 1.96 × 10-3
) as well as the allelic levels

Discussion
At the advent of genome-wide association studies
(GWAS), investigators saw it as a “magic bullet” to deci-
phering the intricacies of complex diseases. While the
initial acceptance was slow due to the massive invest-
ment normally available only to large-scale consortia,
early successes [32], advances in technology and highly
reduced prices have enabled more than 800 GWAS to
be conducted on more than 400 diseases to date [33].
For asthma, recent reviews [34-36] have summarized the
contribution of GWAS to the study of genetics of this
disease. While different GWAS have identified numer-
ous susceptibility variants, the results from these studies
have not been able to fully explain the heritability of
asthma and allergy. While epistasis, gene-environment
interactions, rare and un-detected/un-known variants
have been suggested to account for the “missing” herit-
ability, none of these discount the ability of the GWAS
to highlight important genes that are likely to be
involved in susceptibility to the disease.
This paper presents a genome-wide case-control asso-
ciation study performed using pooled genotyping to
study asthma in an ethnic Chinese population. Giam-
paolo Ricci et al. very recently also published a pooling-
based GWAS on asthma. They tested 269 children of
European descent comparing asthmatics and non-asth-
matics with rhino-conjunctivitis [37]. The strongest
association detected was for a SNP on the C5 gene at a
P value of 1.1 × 10-3
. Our study improves on this with a
larger sample size in the discovery as well as replication
stages, which resulted in associations with higher levels
of significance. Observations from our GWAS were that
multiple SNPs throughout the genome (Table 2) passed
the standard genome-wide threshold of 5.52 × 10-8
in
multiple case versus control comparisons. Replication in
a larger sample set via individual genotyping revealed
that the strongest association signal was at PERLD1 on
chromosome 17.
The 17q chromosomal region has been linked with
asthma and allergy, via both linkage and candidate gene
based studies in the past. Early genome-wide linkage
studies identified associations of the 17q12-23 region to
asthma and atopy in European populations [38,39]. Two

recent meta-analyses of genome-wide linkage screens for
asthma and its associated phenotypes have also indi-
cated the significance of the 17q12-q24 region with
allergic asthma and associated sub-phenotypes [40,41].
Candidate gene-based studies have identified genes such
as CCL2 and CCL5 (17q11-q12), CCL11 and ITGB3
(17q21), and ACE (17q23), which have been found to be
associated and well replicated in multiple popula-
tions [1,2]. The first GWAS for childhood asthma iden-
tified ORMDL3 (and GSDMB) also present in the 17q21
region [4]. This association has also been well replicated
in multiple populations including Scottish, Northern
Europeans, North Americans of European ancestry, Afri-
can, Australian, French-Canadian, Mexicans, Puerto
Ricans, and Koreans [12,13,42-46].
The PERLD1 SNP (rs2941504), whose association we
identified and replicated, was also found to be associated
with asthma in a number of other studies. In one of the
studies which replicated the association on 17q21 to
asthma [44], a GWAS was performed on 4917 case and
34,589 control samples from six European and one Kor-
ean populations. In this study, the presence of the A
allele of SNP rs2941504 was reported to be significantly
associated with asthma with P value of 1.2 × 10-8
and
odds ratio of 1.29; this association remained significant
(P = 3.2 × 10-2
) even after adjusting for the effect of the
originally associated ORMDL3 variant (P = 1.56 × 10-7
).
In another GWAS on asthma [10], 473 cases, 1892
population controls and 363 phenotyped controls of
European descent were genotyped. While the strongest
associations reported were to RAD50 (P = 3.04 × 10-7
)
and HLA-DQB1 (P = 9.55 × 10-6
), two SNPs within
PERLD1 (rs1565922 and rs2941503) also had P values
which were less than 0.05 (P = 4.63 × 10-4
and P = 6.46
× 10-4
). Most recently, a large-scale, consortium-based
GWAS of asthma reiterated the significance of the 17q
region in childhood asthma through the genotyping of
more than 26,000 individuals [12] of European descent.
In this latest study, genes such as ORMDL3 and
GSDMB expectedly showed the strongest significance to
childhood asthma (random-effect P values of 5.24 × 10-
21
and 6.45 × 10-23
respectively). Interestingly, 4 SNPs
within PERLD1 (including rs2941504 which we had
found significant) were also presented with highly signif-
icant P values ranging from 1.26 × 10-7
to 1.74 × 10-10
with odds ratios around 0.84 (0.79-0.90). While none of
the above mentioned studies explicitly mentioned
PERLD1 being associated with asthma, the indicated P
values were either listed in tables within the main text
or in supplementary material. While many studies repli-
cating the association of the 17q region to asthma have
been published, association with SNPs in PERLD1 have
only appeared in the above mentioned three. This sug-
gests that despite the proximity to ORMDL3 and
GSDMB, the association at PERLD1 might possibly be
independent from them. In this study, the genome-wide
signal whose association we confirmed was indeed at
PERLD1 (Table 4) rather than anywhere else in the
region despite the strong linkage disequilibrium to adja-
cent genes on 17q12 (Figure 2). In all, the results from
these different studies rather effectively replicate the
association that we independently discovered through
our own GWAS.
There has been considerable evidence to suggest that
allergic sensitization does not correlate well with allergic
disease presentation [47,48]. As such, many genetic

studies choose to use case-control definitions based
purely on doctor diagnosis or self-reported symptomol-
ogy without taking into account the atopic condition.
This is done to exclude any interference from genes
involved in the general mechanisms of allergy. However,
we feel that not accounting for allergic sensitization
detracts the involvement of immunological mechanisms
from the etiology of allergic disease. We might also be
discrediting the possibility of atopic individuals develop-
ing asthma later on. While this was the impetus for our
use of non-asthmatic, non-atopic controls in our study,
we also genotyped an additional 1445 non-asthmatic
atopic control samples. Doing so allowed us to see the
effect our significant SNP had on atopy itself as well
asthma while disregarding the effects of atopy. Positive
associations at P values less than 0.05 were detected in
both the asthma versus atopy and atopy versus control
comparisons. This suggested that there were indeed sig-
nificant differences between the diseased, healthy and
“intermediate” conditions. This was not unexpected, as
an association to allergic asthma would likely involve
both an ‘asthmatic’ and an ‘allergy’ component. How-
ever, the difference in the P values obtained from a case
versus control comparison (Pgeneral = 1.48 × 10-6
), and
those obtained from a case versus atopy (Pgeneral = 2.25
× 10-2
) or atopy versus control (Pgeneral = 1.96 × 10-3
)
comparisons are suggestive that the association is likely
to allergic asthma and not to either of the conditions
individually (Table 5).
The PERLD1 gene is observed to be in complete link-
age disequilibrium based on the Hapmap CHB reference
population (Figure 3). In other words, rs2941504 was
able to tag all the variation in the whole gene. This sug-
gests that genotyping other variants within the gene
would produce similar associations. Furthermore, any
functional variants within the gene could possibly lead
to variation in gene function. Sequence motif-based pre-
diction of functionality of the SNPs within PERLD1
(based on Hapmap CHB) revealed that most of the
SNPs were likely to be involved in splicing regulation,
either as exon-splicing enhancer or exon-splicing silen-
cer recognition sites (data not shown). Alternative spli-
cing of the mRNA due to the effects of any combination
of these SNPs can possibly result in structural and/or
functional diversification of PERLD1.
PERLD1, originally discovered as PER1 in yeast, was
found to be involved in the lipid remodeling of glycosyl-
phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors [49]. GPI-anchors are
glycolipid moieties which are added on to the C-terminus
of proteins during post-translational modification. Once
attached, the GPI-anchor allows cell-surface proteins such
as CD48 and CD59 to be attached onto the cell mem-
brane [50]. The importance of GPI-anchors in cell-signal-
ing has been observed in mammalian T-cells where cell-
surface molecules which were displayed via GPI-anchors
lost their ability to stimulate T-cell activation and prolif-
eration. This occurred when either the proteins themselves
were inhibited by specific antibodies or their ability to be
displayed on the cell surface was affected through the inhi-
bition of GPI-anchor attachment to their c-terminus [51].
CD48 was found to be a critical effector molecule in cell
adhesion, pathogen recognition, and activation and regula-
tion of various immunoregulatory pathways [52-55].
CD59, the principal ligand for CD2, has been shown to
enhance T-cell activation and proliferation following
cross-linking with CD2 [56]. Both these GPI-anchored
markers were shown to be involved in proliferation of T-
cells in patients suffering from bone marrow failure [57]
and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [58]. The abil-
ity to regulate the activity and proliferative ability of T-
cells through the control of GPI-anchor attachment sug-
gest PERLD1’s involvement in the inflammatory aspect of
asthma.
We understand that the main limitation of this study
is the pooling approach we took in the discovery phase.
The use of pooled genotyping introduces errors due to
array variation [59] as a result of differential hybridiza-
tion of samples within the pool to the various probes of
the array. Secondly, even though we had previously
shown that the estimated allele frequencies obtained
from pooled genotyping highly resemble the actual allele
frequencies of the samples within the pool [18], we still
suspected that they might represent the relative fre-
quency of the allele within the pooled samples rather
than the actual allele frequency of the samples. This
could possibly result in an inflation of the differences in
allele frequencies between case and control pools, and
hence inflated P values and potential false positives.
Lastly, the use of pooled samples means that actual gen-
otypes will not be available thus preventing more
detailed analysis of the nature or model of association.
We solved these issues by firstly genotyping each pool in
triplicate and averaging across the replicates to account
for the error due to the array itself. Secondly, we used the
obtained P values only to rank the SNPs in terms of rela-
tive differences in allele frequencies within each pool pair;
these P values were not considered to be indicative of
strength of association. The commonly employed Bonfer-
roni-corrected genome-wide cut-off was used to narrow
down a list of potential hits. To filter out false positives,
we compared the 4 separate lists of SNPs obtained from
separate analysis of the 4 sets of pools (A-D), and short-
listed SNPs which appeared in 2 or more lists. We
hypothesized that SNPs which passed the cut-off in more
case-control comparisons were more likely to be truly
associated and not just false positive hits. True enough,
the association we are able to replicate (SNP rs2941504 on
PERLD1) was the only one to appear in 3 out of the 4 sets

of shortlisted SNPs; the P value in the 4th
pool set (Pool A,
Table 2) was also relatively lower than any of the other P
values of the remainder 18 shortlisted SNPs. Furthermore,
it was the only SNP out of the 19 shortlisted ones which
remained significant in the replication stage, suggesting
that all the other SNPs were likely to have been false posi-
tives. We also individually genotyped the samples used in
the original pools to permit a combined analysis with the
replication sample set which allowed the elucidation of the
nature of and identification of the best fit model to explain
the observed association. This allowed us to prove that the
association at rs2941504 was indeed real, and not just an
artefact of pooled genotyping in the discovery phase.
Conclusions
In this study, we have overcome the limitations of using
pooled samples in the discovery phase, to identify a
novel asthma gene whose association we replicated in
an independent sample set; this association can also be
corroborated by data from other studies. While it is the
ORMDL3 and GSDMB genes in the 17q21 region that
have been repeatedly linked with asthma in numerous
other populations, it is not unreasonable to expect the
immediately adjacent PERLD1 in the 17q12 region to
also be directly associated with asthma in a Singapore
Chinese population which has yet to be studied for the
disease. The association of this gene offers new insights
into the mechanisms of genetic susceptibility to asthma.
While further studies are needed to investigate its func-
tional relevance to the disease, our identification of
PERLD1 as an asthma gene reinforces the importance of
chromosome 17q12 in the etiology of the disease.
