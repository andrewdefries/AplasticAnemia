INTRODUCTION
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a potentially cura-
tive treatment for patients with acute and chronic leukemia.
However, a substantial proportion of transplant recipients
experience acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) after trans-
plantation; overall, aGVHD above grade II is significantly
associated with treatment-related mortality.
Although supportive care after allogeneic stem cell trans-
plantation (SCT) has improved in recent years, aGVHD re-
mains a life-threatening complication that occurs at trans-
plantation centers and results in significant morbidity and
mortality. The combination of methotrexate (MTx) and cy-
closporine A (CsA) has significantly reduced the incidence
and severity of aGVHD compared to the use of a single agent
(1, 2). In a recent study, investigators found that a high serum
CsA level after transplantation was associated with a relative-
ly low incidence of aGVHD above grade II (3).
In a previous study, the early absolute lymphocyte count
(ALC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level after transplanta-
tion were found to be associated with significant aGVHD (4,
5), while lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) has rarely been stud-
ied. One recent study reported that the serum LDH level was
a significant adverse predictor of outcome in HLA-matched
sibling bone marrow transplants for acute myelogenous leu-
kemia (AML) (6).
Therefore, the present study was performed to evaluate early
risk factors for aGVHD after transplantation, including the
serum levels of LDH, CsA, ALC, and CRP.

Influence of Lactate Dehydrogenase and Cyclosporine A Level on the
Incidence of Acute Graft-versus-host Disease After Allogeneic Stem
Cell Transplantation
Previous reports have suggested that a high serum cyclosporine A (CsA) level could
result in a lower incidence of acute-graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). An elevat-
ed serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level has been reported to be an adverse
predictor of outcome in stem cell transplantation (SCT) for acute myeloid leukemia.
In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the records of 24 patients who received
allogeneic SCT from an HLA-matched sibling donor for acute and chronic myeloge-
nous leukemia. Univariate analysis showed that two factors (the serum CsA level
at the third week after SCT and the LDH level at the third week after SCT) were
significantly associated with the incidence of aGVHD among several variables (age,
sex, stem cell source, cell dose, C-reactive protein, absolute lymphocyte count, condi-
tioning regimens, and time to engraftment). A higher serum level of CsA and lower
serum LDH level at the third week after SCT were associated with a lower incidence
of aGVHD (P=0.015, 0.030). In multivariate analysis, the serum CsA level (hazard
ratio [HR], 0.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.022-0.652, P=0.0014) and serum
LDH level (HR, 6.59; 95% CI, 1.197-36.316, P=0.030) at the third week after SCT
were found to be independent factors that were significantly associated with the
development of aGVHD. We conclude that a high CsA level and low LDH level
might predict a low cumulative incidence of aGVHD after allogeneic transplanta-
tion from a matched sibling donor.

(91.7%) and chronic myelogenous leukemia in 2 patients
(8.3%). The median age of the patients was 41 yr (range 21-
56 yr), and the male-to-female ratio was 1:1 (Table 1).
Conditioning regimens
The conditioning regimen included a combination of flu-
darabine (intravenously, 30 mg/m2
for 6 days) with busulfan
(intravenously, 0.8 mg/kg qid for 2 days) in 20 patients (83.3
%), or a combination of cyclophosphamide (intravenously,
60 mg/kg for 2 days) and busulfan (0.8 mg/kg qid for 2 days)
with or without etoposide (intravenously, 400 mg/m2
for 2
days) in four patients (16.7%) (Table 1).
GVHD prophylaxis
CsA and methotrexate were used for aGVHD prophylaxis.
CsA was administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg per day through
24-hr continuous infusion starting on day -1. The dose of
CsA was titrated and maintained at a serum level between
200 and 400 ng/mL. The MTx dosage was 5 mg/m2
, admin-
istered intravenously on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.
Stem cell support and supportive medication
Mononuclear cells (7.25±4.5×108
/kg), CD3+ cells (6.0±
3.8×108
/kg), and CD34+ cells (2.8±1.6×106
/kg) were
measured in the patients. Granulocyte-colony stimulating
factor was administered daily from day +4. All patients receiv-
ed fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis and acyclovir for viral
prophylaxis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was used as
prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia for at least 6 months.
Engraftment measurement and grading of acute GVHD
Engraftment was defined as an absolute neutrophil count
of ≥500/μL and an unsupported platelet count of ≥20,000/
μL for two consecutive days or detection of donor DNA by
PCR-short tandem repeat (STR). aGVHD was graded uni-
formly according to the Glucksberg criteria (7).
Statistical considerations
The Mann-Whitney test was used for the comparison of
continuous variables. The cumulative incidence of aGVHD
was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-
rank test. In univariate analysis, the serum CsA and LDH
level at the third week after allogeneic transplantation were
found to significantly affect the incidence of aGVHD above
grade II. Cox’s proportional regression was used in multivari-
ate models to predict the relative risk of the two factors, the
CsA and LDH levels, at the third week after transplantation.
All statistical tests were two-sided; P<0.05 was used to indi-
cate statistical significance. Data were analyzed using SPSS
12 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A.) software.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The me-
dian follow-up for the patients was 32 months, with 21 pati-
ents surviving with complete chimerism (87.5%); three pa-
tients relapsed (12.5%) and two patients died. The cumula-
tive incidence of aGVHD above grade II after transplantation
was 33.3% (8 of 24 patients), and the median onset time was
33.5 days (range 24-58 days). Twenty-one patients received
a peripheral blood stem cell graft, while two patients received
a bone marrow graft. All patients were in their first period
of complete remission at the time of transplantation.
Correlation between serum CsA level and cumulative
incidence of aGVHD above grade II
The serum CsA level was measured every other day, and
the CsA dose was adjusted to maintain the serum CsA level
between 200 and 400 ng/mL. When the patients were group-
ed according to the mean serum CsA level during each week,
into the above 300 ng/mL group (mean CsA level 332.1±
15, higher CsA group; HCsA group) and the below 300 ng/
mL group (mean CsA level 231.3±28, lower CsA group;
LCsA group), serum levels in the first and second week were
not correlated with the incidence of aGVHD above grade II
(P=0.320) (Table 4). However, in the third week, the HCsA

aGVHD above grade II compared to the LCsA group (P=
0.015) (Table 2, Fig. 1). There were no significant differences
in sex, age, stem cell source, conditioning regimen, cell dose,
or time to engraftment between the HCsA and the LCsA
group in the third week (Table 2).
The mean CsA level at week three was significantly higher
in patients who developed aGVHD above grade II (P=0.011,
Table 4). However, there were no significant differences in
the mean CsA levels at other weeks between the aGVHD
above grade II present and absent groups.
Correlation between serum LDH level and cumulative
incidence of aGVHD above grade II
The serum LDH level was measured twice a week after
transplantation. When the higher LDH group (HLDH group,
mean LDH ≥470 U/L) and lower LDH group (LLDH group,
mean LDH <470 U/L) were separated by the upper normal
limit (470 U/L), the HLDH group showed a significantly

dence of aGVHD above grade II was significantly higher in
the HLDH group at the third week (P=0.030, Table 3, Fig.
2). In the group of patients with aGVHD above grade II, the
LDH levels at the first and second week were not significant-
ly different (P=0.787, 0.928), but the LDH level at the third
week was significantly higher than that in the non-aGVHD
group (P=0.023) (Table 4).
Correlations between ALC, serum CRP level, and
cumulative incidence of aGVHD above grade II
ALC was measured at the first, second, and third week after
transplantation. ALC levels after transplantation were not
significantly associated with the incidence of aGVHD (Table
4). The serum CRP levels did not differ between the aGVHD
group and non-aGVHD group in the first, second, or third
week (P=0.610, 0.490, 0.653, Table 4).
Risk assessment for aGVHD above grade II using the CsA
and LDH levels at the third week after transplantation
In univariate analysis, the CsA and LDH levels, (not the
CRP or ALC level) at the third week after transplantation
were significantly associated with aGVHD above grade II
(Table 4). In multivariate analysis, the CsA (hazard ratio [HR],
0.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.022-0.652, P=0.014)
and LDH (HR, 6.59; 95% CI, 1.197-36.316, P=0.030) lev-
els at the third week were independent risk factors of cumu-
lative incidence of aGVHD above grade II (Table 5).
These findings prompted us to measure the predictive value
of the combination of these two factors (CsA and LDH) for
the cumulative incidence of aGVHD above grade II. The

DISCUSSION
We investigated the relationships between the development
of aGVHD after matched sibling allogeneic SCT and sever-
al factors, including serum CsA, LDH, CRP, and ALC. CsA
is a potent immunosuppressant that is used for aGVHD pro-
phylaxis. One study indicated that the blood CsA concentra-
tion, especially at the third week after transplantation, was
important in terms of the incidence of aGVHD (3). In this
study, the cumulative incidence of aGVHD above grade II
was not significantly associated with the serum CsA levels at
the first and second week after SCT, but was higher in pati-
ents with third week CsA levels lower than 300 ng/mL (LCsA
group). This could be explained by the fact that the donor
lymphocytes would have proliferated and would have been
more activated at the third week compared to the second week
after SCT, since the median time to leukocyte engraftment is
14 days. If this is the case, the HCsA group would have a lower
incidence of aGVHD at the third week after SCT. Additional-
ly, in this study, an elevated serum CsA level was not associ-
ated with renal toxicity, survival, or the incidence of relapse.
In a previous study, ALC after transplantation was found
to be associated with aGVHD (5). However, in the present
study, despite high-dose conditioning regimens, ALC levels
at day 21 following transplantation varied, and were not found
to be significantly associated with the incidence of aGVHD.
We thought that because ALC included both the host and
donor cells, it did not truly reflect overall donor lymphocyte
activities.
The serum LDH level is a predictive marker of inflamma-
tion or cell turnover. In the present study, only three patients
had fever at the first week after SCT. However, the patients
did not show any evidence of infection or inflammation after
that time. There was also no indication that serum LDH level
should be increasing during this time, such as cell turnover,
hemolysis, or disease reactivation. The LDH level was also
reported to be a prognostic factor in malignancies such as
germ cell tumors (8, 9), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (10, 11),
and small cell lung cancer (12). In a recent study, increased
LDH levels were shown to adversely affect survival; in anoth-
er study, a high LDH level was found to be an independent,
significantly poor prognostic factor following allogeneic trans-
plantation for acute myeloid leukemia (13). The initiation
of aGVHD requires that donor lymphocytes recognize host
alloantigens after host tissue damage due to conditioning
chemotherapy. Serum LDH is a general indicator of tissue
damage (14). In a previous study, elevated LDH was found
to result from cell proliferation (15). Therefore, we thought
that an elevated LDH level after engraftment may be associ-
ated with host organ damage and the repopulation of activat-
ed donor lymphocytes; an elevated LDH level may influence
the cumulative incidence of aGVHD. In the present study,
the LDH levels at the first and second week after transplan-
tation were not found to be associated with the incidence of
aGVHD above grade II. When two groups (HLDH group
vs. LLDH group) were separated by the upper normal limit
of LDH (470 U/L), the HLDH group at the third week had
a tendency to have a higher incidence of aGVHD above grade
II compared to the LLDH group. At the third week after trans-
plantation, the HLDH group showed a more rapid engraft-
ment rate.
CRP is a well-known marker of inflammation, which is
mainly induced by IL-6 (16). IL-6 is produced by many cell
types, including monocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, and
endothelial cells, which may survive the conditioning regimen
and respond to tissue damage caused by high-dose cytotoxic
agents and infections (17). In the present study, CRP levels
during the early post-transplantation period were measured,
and their associations with the incidence of aGVHD were
investigated. However, the impact of CRP on the development
of aGVHD was not found to be significant in this study.
In univariate analysis, two factors (serum CsA and LDH
levels at the third week after transplantation) were found to
be significantly associated with aGVHD above grade II. Four
groups were created by combining these two factors (HCsA+
HLDH group, HCsA+LLDH group, LCsA+HLDH group,
and LCsA+LLDH group). The LCsA+HLDH group had a
significantly higher incidence of aGVHD than other groups,
while the HCsA+LLDH group had a significantly lower
incidence. The HCsA+HLDH group showed a tendency
toward a decreased cumulative incidence of aGVHD com-
pared to the LCsA+LLDH group.
Using Cox regression analysis, an elevated CsA level and
a lower LDH level were the most important parameters, and
were found to be correlated with a lower incidence of aGVHD
above grade II. However, due to the small number of patients
enrolled in this study, a bias may have affected our analysis.
Thus, further, larger-scale studies are needed.
In conclusion, the serum CsA and LDH levels significantly
affect the incidence of aGVHD above grade II in the study
population. The CsA and LDH levels at the third week after
allogeneic stem cell transplantation appear to be the most
important factors related to the incidence of aGVHD. aGVHD
risk assessment using these two simple predictors is valuable
in clinical practice.
