Antibiotic use in 759 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) patients and 589 controls was compared. Neither total antibiotic use (odds
ratio ¼ 0.7, 95% confidence interval ¼ 0.5–1.2), nor antibiotic use by site, was associated with total NHL, or NHL subtypes. There
were no trends with frequency or age at first use (P trend ¼ 0.23 and 0.26, respectively).

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic during the
1980s was paralleled by a 3–4% annual increase in the incidence
of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) (Hartge et al, 1994). However,
NHL incidence had been increasing since before the 1950s (Zheng
et al, 1992), with some levelling off in recent years (Eltom et al,
2002; Morton et al, 2006). The dramatic rise in antibiotic use since
the 1940s has led some scientists to hypothesise that antibiotics
may increase the risk of developing NHL. In vitro evidence
suggests that certain antibiotics are cytotoxic (Robbana-Barnat
et al, 1997; Summan and Cribb, 2002) or genotoxic (Snyder and
Green, 2001), and some may have immunomodulatory effects (Van
et al, 1996). Moreover, chronic infections treated with antibiotics,
such as tuberculosis, have been associated with NHL (Swerdlow,
2003). While case–control studies of self-reported antibiotic use
have found a 30–90% increased risk of NHL (Bernstein and Ross,
1992; Kato et al, 2003; Chang et al, 2005), no associations were
observed in case–control studies utilising pharmacy (Beiderbeck
et al, 2003) or medical record data (Doody et al, 1996). We
investigated the association between NHL and antibiotics in a large
multicentre case–control study (1998–2000) within the United
States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study methods have been described in detail elsewhere (Chatterjee
et al, 2004; Engels et al, 2004; Hartge et al, 2005). Briefly, 1322
newly diagnosed NHL cases were identified from four geographical
regions covered by the National Cancer Institute’s population-
based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer
registries. All cases residing in Iowa and Seattle, and all African-
American cases and a random sample of Caucasian cases residing
in Detroit and Los Angeles, aged 20–74 years, with a first primary
diagnosis of NHL were eligible. Cases were histologically
confirmed and coded according to the International Classification
of Diseases-Oncology, 2nd Edition (Percy et al, 1990). NHL cases
with known HIV infection were excluded.
Eligible controls were aged 20–74 years, resided in one of the
four geographical regions (Iowa, Seattle, Detroit, or Los Angeles)
and had no known history of HIV infection or NHL. Controls
younger than age 65 were identified using a one-step random digit
dialing approach (Casady and Lepowski, 1993). Controls aged 65
years or older were identified from Medicare eligibility files.
Controls were frequency matched to the distribution of cases by
age (5-year age groups), race, gender, and geographic area.
Human subject review boards at the National Cancer Institute
and all participating institutions approved the study. All subjects
provided written informed consent.
To accommodate a large number of questions the study population
was divided into two groups, each receiving a different version of
the computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI). Our analyses are
focused on the group, including all African-American and one half of
all other participants chosen at random, who completed the CAPI
consisting of a detailed medical history questionnaire.

Epidemiology
Subjects were asked to recall if they had ever taken antibiotics,
in the past 1 year, for infections by organ site and procedure.
Information was also obtained about antibiotics used X5 days for
conditions/procedures not listed in the questionnaire. These data
were combined to create an indicator of having ever used
antibiotics. For each positive response information was gathered
about the number of times antibiotics were used and the age at
first use.
Of the 1332 NHL patients assigned to receive the medical history
version of the CAPI, 1017 (76.4%) were contacted. Of these, 175
refused to participate and 83 did not participate for other reasons
including serious illness, cognitive impairment or failure to
respond to multiple contacts. In total, 759 NHL cases (74.6% of
cases approached, 57.0% of eligible cases) participated.
Of the 1419 controls randomly assigned to complete the medical
history CAPI, 1196 (84.3%) were contacted. Of these, 525 refused
and 82 did not participate for other reasons including serious
illness, cognitive impairment, and failure to respond to multiple
contacts. Therefore, 589 controls (49.2% of potential controls
approached, 41.5% of eligible controls) participated.
Unconditional logistic regression analyses in STATA 10.0 (Stata
Corp., College Station, TX, USA) were used to estimate odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations
between NHL and history of antibiotic use, frequency of use and
age at first use of antibiotics (in tertiles). Tertile cut points were
based on the distributions among the controls. Tests for linear
trend across categories were calculated; reported P-values are two-
sided. Additional analyses were performed for the two most
common NHL subtypes, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
and follicular lymphoma, using polytomous logistic regression.
Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, race, study site, and
education.
RESULTS
Cases were similar to controls with respect to age (P ¼ 0.68),
gender (P ¼ 0.38), and education (P ¼ 0.74) but were less likely to
be African-American (P ¼ 0.03) (Table 1).
Overall, antibiotic use was not associated with an increased risk
of NHL or the DLBCL or follicular subtypes. In addition, no
significant trends were observed with increasing frequency, or
increasing age at first use, of antibiotics, Table 2. No significant
associations were observed when we stratified the analyses by age,
centre, or education (data not shown).
More specifically, there were no significant associations between
NHL overall, or NHL subtypes, and use of antibiotics to treat
infections of the upper respiratory tract, eye, ear, gallbladder,
urinary tract, bowel, brain, prostate, or skin, or antibiotics used to
treat pneumonia, tuberculosis or acne, or antibiotics used before
or after dental surgery (data not shown). In addition, no significant
trends were observed between NHL and increasing frequency of
use, or age at first use, of antibiotics for these conditions (data not
shown). However, antibiotic use for genital infections was
inversely associated with NHL (OR ¼ 0.59, 95% CI ¼ 0.39–0.90).
DISCUSSION
Using data collected as part of a large, population-based, case–
control study, we found that antibiotic use was not associated with
an increased risk of NHL overall, or of the two major subtypes,
DLBCL, or follicular lymphoma (FL). An inverse association
between antibiotics used to treat genital infections and NHL was
observed.
A nested case–control study within the PHARMO database of
drug dispensing records in the Netherlands also reported no
significant association between ever use of antibiotics and NHL
(OR ¼ 0.81, 95% CI ¼ 0.51–1.26) (Beiderbeck et al, 2003). Another
study, from two Kaiser Permanente medical care programmes,
found no association between use of chloramphenicol and NHL,
but this study lacked information on other antibiotics (Doody
et al, 1996).
In contrast, most interview-based case–control studies have
reported that antibiotics are associated with a 30–40% increased
risk of NHL (Bernstein and Ross, 1992; Chang et al, 2005) and Kato
et al (2003), found systemic use of penicillin to be associated with
NHL (OR ¼ 1.6, 95% CI ¼ 1.1–2.2). These investigators have
postulated that their findings could be due to a direct carcinogenic
effect of antibiotics, differential recall bias or the possibility that
frequent antibiotic use could be a surrogate marker for chronic
infections or a compromised immune system (Kato et al, 2003;
Chang et al, 2005).
Recall bias is a concern in case–control studies. Poor
correlation between self-reported medication use and prescription
records has been reported (van den Brandt et al, 1991; West et al,
1995). In an attempt to improve recall of self-reported antibiotic
usage, we used a method, described by Klungel et al (2000) in
which participants are asked to recall their use of medications for a
range of conditions. A similar methodological approach was used
in the case–control study by Kato et al (2003); however, our study
was larger and used a more comprehensive assessment of
antibiotic use. In addition, subjects were asked to recall medication
usage more than 1 year prior to diagnosis to reduce the possibility
of reverse causality. Information was not collected about antibiotic
type as it would be difficult to elucidate lifetime use of specific
antibiotics from a case–control study; thus, we were unable to
determine if specific antibiotic types were associated with NHL.
Using diagnostic information from four SEER cancer registries,
stratified analyses showed no significant associations between

antibiotic use and the two main subtypes of NHL: DLBCL and
follicular lymphoma. Although our participation rates for controls
were not optimal and could potentially introduce bias, stratifica-
tion by factors that differed between participants and non-
participants (including age, centre, and education) resulted in no
significant associations with NHL, suggesting that major biases are
unlikely.
An inverse association was observed between antibiotic use for
genital infections and NHL. However, the lack of a biologically
plausible explanation for this association suggests that it may have
resulted by chance since multiple testing was not controlled for in
the stratified analyses.
In summary, our results suggest that antibiotic use does not
increase NHL risk. Antibiotics are a diverse group of drugs with
different mechanisms of action and biological effects (Van et al,
1996). Difficulty of assessing use of specific antibiotics in
questionnaire-based case–control studies, as well as lack of
biological plausibility for a causative association between non-
specific antibiotic use and NHL, suggests that future assessments
of this hypothesis should be conducted using cohort studies, with
documentation of specific antibiotic use from medical records, or
large pharmaceutical data sets.
