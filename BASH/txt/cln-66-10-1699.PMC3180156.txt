OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the association between different inflammatory markers and specific
clinical endpoints in patients with febrile neutropenia.
METHOD: We prospectively evaluated the expression of procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin 8 (IL-8), induced protein-10,
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), two soluble TNF-a receptors (sTNF-R I and sTNF-R II), monocyte chemotactic
protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, and eotaxin in 37 episodes of febrile neutropenia
occurring in 31 hospitalized adult onco-hematologic patients. Peripheral blood samples were collected in the
morning at inclusion (day of fever onset) and on days 1, 3, and 7 after the onset of fever. Approximately 2–3 ml of
plasma was obtained from each blood sample and stored at -80˚C.
RESULTS: The sTNF-R II level at inclusion (day 1), the PCT level on the day of fever onset, and the change (day 3 - day 1) in
the IL-8 and eotaxin levels were significantly higher in patients who died during the 28-day follow-up. A requirement for
early adjustment of antimicrobial treatment was associated with higher day 3 levels of IL-8, sTNF-R II, PCT, and MCP-1.
CONCLUSION: Procalcitonin, sTNF-R II, IL-8, MCP-1, and eotaxin could potentially be used to assess the risk of death
and the requirement for early adjustment of antimicrobial treatment in febrile, neutropenic onco-hematologic
patients. The levels of the other markers showed no association with any of the evaluated endpoints.

INTRODUCTION
Neutropenia, a common feature in onco-hematological
patients undergoing chemotherapy, is one of the most
important risk factors for bacterial and fungal infections.1
Due to the potential life-threatening severity of this
condition, a low threshold of clinical suspicion and prompt
antimicrobial therapy are essential to effectively manage
infectious complications in neutropenic patients.2
However,
identifying infections in this population can be challenging,
and fever is occasionally the only clinical sign.3
Risk stratification is also of the utmost importance when
dealing with febrile neutropenic patients, as they constitute a
heterogeneous population with a variable risk for serious
complications.4-5
Stratification allows the clinician to identify
a subgroup of patients who might be safely treated with oral
antibiotics.6-7
In 1988 and 1992, Talcott et al. proposed and
validated, respectively, a risk model for classifying patients
with febrile neutropenia according to disease burden
(remission vs. activity), presence of comorbidities, and the
source of fever (i.e., community-acquired fever or nosoco-
mial fever).8-9
More recently, in a multicenter observational
study, the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in
Cancer (MASCC) derived a model to identify low-risk
neutropenic patients (those with MASCC score $21 points),
with 71% sensitivity and a 91% positive predictive value.10
Although useful, the Talcott and MASCC models have
several limitations, chiefly their use of subjective, institution-
dependent variables and high misclassification rates.11
Biological markers have been proposed as an additional
tool for risk assessment in patients with febrile neutropenia.
The accuracy and predictive value of these markers have
been tested for clinical and laboratory endpoints (e.g.,
bacteremia and mortality) in small, single-center studies,
but these results have been contradictory.12-15
In general,
these markers are better suited for the identification of

low-risk patients, as they have high negative predictive
values for severe complications.16
In this pilot study, we aimed to evaluate the plasma levels
of different biological markers in febrile neutropenic
patients and assess the relationship between these markers
and detrimental clinical events.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Patients and settings
We conducted a prospective, single-center study of
patients with febrile neutropenia admitted to the hemato-
logical ward of a tertiary general hospital in Belo Horizonte,
Brazil. All adult patients (age $18 years) admitted to the
University Hospital of the Universidade Federal de Minas
Gerais (UH-UFMG) from September 2008 to March 2009
with an onco-hematological diagnosis and febrile neutrope-
nia were evaluated for eligibility. The UH-UFMG is a 460-
bed general hospital that is a regional reference center for
the management of highly complex conditions, including
onco-hematological diseases.
Patients with a neutrophil count less than 1,000/mm3
were evaluated by two dedicated investigators and invited
to participate in the study if they met the following
inclusion criteria: (i) a primary diagnosis of an onco-
hematological disease; (ii) a neutrophil count less than 500
per mm3
or a neutrophil count less than 1,000 per mm3
that
was expected to fall below 500 per mm3
within the next
48 h, with an anticipated duration of neutropenia of at least
six days; (iii) fever, defined as an axillary temperature
greater than 37.8˚C in two consecutive readings at least one
hour apart or a single reading greater than 38.3˚C; and (iv)
either scheduled antibiotic therapy or prior antibiotic
therapy for less than one day. Patients were excluded from
the study if they presented with a fever that was clearly
regarded by the attending physician as being of a non-
infectious origin and for which no antibiotic therapy was
initiated. Finally, inclusion was considered for individual
episodes of febrile neutropenia, and the same patient could
be included more than once, provided the episodes of
febrile neutropenia occurred during different hospitaliza-
tion periods.
The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) antibiotic
therapy for more than 24 h at the time of inclusion or (ii)
presentation with severe organ dysfunction (e.g., use of
vasoactive amines or mechanical ventilation).
The variables recorded included age, gender, comorbid-
ities, source of infection (when known), primary diagnosis
and its state, current antibiotic therapy, and chemother-
apeutic regimens. The presence of comorbidities was
measured using the modified Charlson’s score.17
We also
determined each patient’s MASCC risk index, a scoring
system for identifying low-risk febrile neutropenic cancer
patients10,18
at baseline. Variables recorded daily during the
follow-up included hemodynamic and respiratory para-
meters and any changes in antibiotic therapy. All-cause 28-
day mortality and length of hospital stay were also
recorded.
The Ethics Committee of the Universidade Federal de
Minas Gerais approved this study, and all included patients
provided written, informed consent. In conducting this
study and writing this report, we adhered to the Standard
for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy studies checklist and
recommendations.19
Endpoints
The evaluated endpoints were (i) any change in antibiotic
regimen within the first 72 h of therapy, as determined by
the attending physician; (ii) bacteremia; and (iii) all-cause
28-day mortality.
A change of antibiotic regimen was defined as one of the
following two situations: (i) the addition of a new
antimicrobial agent with a broader or different spectrum
compared with the current treatment, or (ii) a complete
change in the antimicrobial regimen for any reason other
than adverse effects related to the previous agents.
Bacteremia was defined as the growth of any pathogenic
microorganism in one or more blood samples or the growth
of representative skin microorganisms (e.g., coagulase-
negative staphylococci) in at least two blood samples
obtained from different sites.
Procedures
All the included patients underwent a clinical evaluation at
baseline, including clinical anamnesis and a physical examina-
tion. Peripheral blood samples were collected using vacuum
tubes (BD Vacutainer SST II Plus plastic tubes; Becton
Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil) in the
morning on the initial day of fever (inclusion or day 0) and sub-
sequently on days 1, 3, and 7. Approximately 2–3 ml of plasma
was obtained from each blood sample and stored at -80˚C.
The management of patients with febrile neutropenia
followed the recommendations proposed by the Infectious
Diseases Society of America.3
Briefly, two blood culture
samples were obtained for all neutropenic (see the above
inclusion criteria) patients with fever or unexplained clinical
deterioration. Urine cultures and imaging were performed as
clinically indicated. The empirical antibiotic regimen used for
the first episode of febrile neutropenia was monotherapy with
cefepime or a combination of ceftazidime and an aminoglyco-
side. If risk factors for staphylococcal infection were observed
(e.g., catheter-related infection, shock, or mucositis), vanco-
mycin was added to the antimicrobial regimen.
The included patients were followed for 28 days or until
death or transfer/discharge from the hospital, whichever
occurred first.
Laboratory exams
Plasma levels of nine inflammatory molecules were
evaluated in this study: procalcitonin (PCT), induced pro-
tein-10 (IP-10), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), soluble
TNF-a receptors type I and type II (sTNF-R I and sTNF-R II),
interleukin 8 (IL-8), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1),
macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (MIP-1a), and
eotaxin. All assays were performed at the end of the inclusion
period; thus, there was no interference in the management of
the studied patients. Plasma levels of TNF-a, sTNF-R I, sTNF-
R II, MIP-1a, IL-8, eotaxin, IP-10, and MCP-1 were measured
using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA)
(Duoset R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The PCT
level was measured using an enzyme-linked fluorescent
immunoassay (PCT Vidas Brahms, bioMe´rieux, France), with
an assay sensitivity of 0.05 mg/L, which is approximately four
times greater than the mean normal level.

normally distributed variables or as the median and range
for non-normally distributed variables. The data were
analyzed using a x2
test (Yates’ test or Fisher’s exact test),
a two-sample t-test, or a Mann-Whitney U test, as appro-
priate. Age, gender, main hematological diagnosis and all-
cause 28-day mortality were analyzed for the total number
of patients included in the study. All other analyses were
performed taking into account the total number of episodes
of febrile neutropenia included in the study. ROC curves
were constructed to establish the accuracy of each studied
marker in predicting the proposed endpoints. Sensitivity,
specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and
positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated once
the best cut-off levels of these molecules were defined. The
collected data were entered into a relational database (Excel
2000; Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and then converted into
SPSS files (SPSS 15.0; SPSS, Chicago, United States) for
the analyses. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered
significant.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the patients
Overall, 222 episodes of neutropenia were assessed for
eligibility. From these, 37 episodes of febrile neutropenia
observed in 31 patients met the enrollment criteria and were
included in the final analysis. The main characteristics of the
included episodes are shown in Table I. Of the 31 included
patients, 23 (74.2%) were male, and the mean (¡SD) age of
the cohort was 38.5 (¡12.3) years. The main hematological
diagnoses were acute myeloid leukemia (10 episodes;
32.3%), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (7 episodes; 22.5%), or
multiple myeloma (5 episodes; 16.1%) (Table I).
Of the 37 included episodes of febrile neutropenia, 22
(59%) were secondary to chemotherapy for the hematologi-
cal disease, and 15 (41%) episodes occurred after bone
marrow transplantation (9 allogeneic and 6 autologous).
Other than fever, most cases did not present signs or
symptoms suggestive of infection. Mucositis was observed
in eight (21%) episodes. Two patients (2%) presented with
smooth-tissue abscesses.
Based on the MASCC model, 75% of the episodes were
classified as low risk (score $21 points). Furthermore, 21
(59%) episodes had an ECOG of 0 or 1; that is, the patients
were fully active or only physically strenuous activity was
restricted. Finally, as measured using the modified
Charlson’s score, most patients did not present with any
comorbidities (Table I).
Inflammatory molecules and antibiotic regimen
change
In 12 (32%) episodes of febrile neutropenia, a change in
antimicrobial regimen was necessary during the first 72 h of
treatment. The circulating levels of sTNF-R II (p = 0.036), IL-
8 (p = 0.047), MCP-1 (p = 0.008), and PCT (p = 0.038), mea-
sured at day 3, were significantly higher in patients
requiring a change in antibiotic regimen compared with
those not requiring a change. Table II depicts the best cut-off
levels for these markers, as defined by the receiver
operating ROC curve (Figure 1), as well as the correspond-
ing accuracy. Based on these data, the PCT level had the
highest positive predictive value for identifying patients
requiring an adjustment in antimicrobial therapy (83%).
Inflammatory molecules and bacteremia
Of the 37 episodes of febrile neutropenia, 13 (35%)
presented with a positive blood culture during hospitaliza-
tion. Overall, 15 species were isolated, with two patients
presenting with mixed sepsis. Gram-positive (eight cases)
and Gram-negative (seven cases) bacteria were similarly
represented, with coagulase-negative staphylococci, S.
aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa being
the most frequently isolated species. None of the markers
examined showed an association with bacteremia.
Inflammatory molecules and all-cause 28-day
mortality
Nine (29%) of the thirty-one patients died during the follow-
up period. The circulating levels of sTNF-R II measured at day
1 (p = 0.034) and the PCT level measured on the day of fever
presentation (p = 0.024) were lower in patients who survived
compared with the levels in patients who died (Table III).
Additionally, the eotaxin level increased significantly from
day 1 to day 3 (day 3 – day 1) in the patients who died
(p = 0.023), as shown in Table III. Figure 2 shows the ROC
curve used to define the best cut-off levels for these markers
using death as an endpoint. Due to technical reasons, only 24
of the 37 (65%) episodes had the plasma PCT level tested at
inclusion. Therefore, a ROC curve was independently con-
structed for this marker (data not shown). Based on this curve,
a PCT level greater than 1.2 mg/L was associated with 28-day
mortality, with a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 54%.
DISCUSSION
Clinical information is often limited when predicting the
outcome of neutropenic onco-hematological patients. In this
study, 9 (29%) of 31 patients died during the follow-up
period, even though their MASCC score was high.
Conversely, only one death occurred in the patients
classified as high risk based on the MASCC index (data
not shown). Inflammatory markers may be a potential tool
to enhance the accuracy of risk stratification in neutropenic

onco-hematological patients. Several endpoints and multi-
ple inflammatory molecules have been tested in the
literature; however, the available data are contradictory,
and a reliable biomarker has yet to be found.12-13,20
In this pilot study, we were unable to demonstrate any
association between the studied inflammatory molecules
and bacteremia. This finding contrasts with the results of
previous studies.13-14
For instance, Kern and colleagues
evaluated the association between circulating levels of IL-8
and bacteremia resulting from Gram-negative bacilli in 133
patients with febrile neutropenia. They found that IL-8
levels above 2,000 pg/mL on the day of fever predicted
bacteremia, with positive and negative predictive values of
73% and 94%, respectively.14
Lehrnbecher and colleagues
found similar results studying IL-8 and both fungal
infections and bacteremia induced by Gram-negative
bacilli.21
In a smaller sample of neutropenic patients, von
Lilienfeld-Toal et al. demonstrated that, in contrast with the
C-reactive protein level, both the PCT and IL-6 levels were
significantly higher in bacteremic patients than in patients
presenting with pneumonia but not bacteremia, fever of
unknown origin or non-infectious fever.22

The requirement for a change in antibiotic regimen was
used as a surrogate indicator for an inadequate response to
the antimicrobial therapy. The day 3 circulating levels of
PCT, sTNF-R II, IL-8, and MCP-1 were significantly higher
in patients requiring antibiotic regimen modification com-
pared with the levels in patients who were maintained on
their initial regimen. Most importantly, the PCT level on the
day of fever presentation (i.e., at inclusion) and the sTNF-R
II level on day 1 were also associated with all-cause 28-day
mortality, as they were significantly higher in the patients
who died. TNF receptors are expressed on the cell
membrane of virtually all nucleated cells. Following a
bacterial insult, soluble TNF receptors can be detected
earlier than TNF-a; however, their half-life is only 6 to 20
minutes.23
While TNF-R I can mediate almost all TNF-a-
associated activities, at physiological levels, TNF-R II only
shows signal transduction activity in a few cell types, such
as T cells. The inducible expression of TNF-R II might fulfill
other important functions, such as the functional neutraliza-
tion and clearance of TNF from the circulation.24
To the best
of our knowledge, soluble type I and type II TNF receptors
have never been tested as markers for clinical risk
assessment in adult onco-hematological patients.
PCT is a precursor of calcitonin and is expressed by most
parenchymal organs during a systemic inflammatory
response, especially responses associated with bacterial

infections.25
PCT has been investigated in several clinical
settings and has been shown to be a useful diagnostic and
prognostic marker26
as well as a potential therapeutic
guide.27
Along with IL-8 and IL-6, PCT is one of the most
studied biomarkers in neutropenic patients. Even though
some negative results have been published,20
most studies
suggest that PCT has diagnostic potential in neutropenic
patients. In this context, Persson and colleagues demon-
strated that the PCT level rose within two days of the onset
of febrile neutropenia and was sustained in patients who
were more likely to develop severe or unstable infections
compared with patients who presented with no complica-
tions.28
In another study, the same group demonstrated that
the PCT level was more accurate than the C-reactive protein
level in discriminating febrile neutropenic patients with
bacteremia from those without bacteremia;13
similar results
have been published by Massaro et al.29
Finally, in an
observational, multicenter European study with 158 neu-
tropenic patients, Giamarellou and colleagues showed that a
PCT level above 5 ng/mL strongly suggests the presence of
severe sepsis.30
In addition to sTNF-R II, MCP-1, and PCT, the change in
eotaxin levels from day 1 to day 3 was significantly
associated with all-cause 28-day mortality. The eotaxin level
significantly increased from inclusion to the third day of
follow-up in patients who did not survive. This association
between eotaxin level and 28-day mortality in neutropenic
patients was a surprising finding. Eotaxin acts primarily as
a chemokine, recruiting eosinophils via CCR3. Eotaxin has
been shown to play a role in human allergic diseases31
and
can attract cell types other than eosinophils under certain
circumstances.32
However, neither the sTNF receptors nor
eotaxin has been evaluated as a risk factor in febrile
neutropenia.
It should be noted that there are limitations to this study.
First, this was a single-center study with a small number of
patients, which limits the generalizability of the results. For
instance, the small sample size, along with the low
frequency of bacteremia (35%) observed among the studied
patients, might have prevented us from detecting any
association between bacteremia and the investigated mar-
kers. However, this was a pilot study, and these results will
be verified in a larger cohort with a pre-defined sample of
patients. Second, some patients with more than one
neutropenic episode were included, potentially leading to
an underestimation of the number of deaths. Third, only
35% of the studied episodes presented with bacteremia;
most cases of fever were not microbiologically confirmed as
infectious fever. Due to the small number of patients, we
were unable to evaluate patient subgroups (e.g., confirmed
and unconfirmed infections) for the other studied end-
points. Finally, some patients had undergone blood marrow
transplantation, which increases the heterogeneity of the
studied population. As this was an initial, pilot study, some
of these limitations were anticipated. Our group is currently
conducting complementary studies with a larger number of
patients, focusing on the most promising markers.
In conclusion, in this pilot study, we examined the
predictive potential of different biological markers in 37
episodes of febrile neutropenia occurring in 31 patients with
an onco-hematological diagnosis. The PCT, sTNF-R II, IL-8,
eotaxin, and MCP-1 levels, measured at different times
during the first three days of follow-up were significantly
associated with all-cause 28-day mortality and/or the
requirement for a change in antibiotic therapy. None of
the studied molecules were able to differentiate febrile
neutropenic patients with bacteremia from those patients
without bacteremia. Because this was a pilot study, our
findings must be confirmed in a larger prospective, multi-
center cohort.
