BODY COMPOSITION IN EARLY GROWTH:
LESSONS FROM DOMESTIC ANIMALS
J E Harding
Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, New Zealand
The effects of changes in nutrition on body composition
of the growing animal depend on the timing, as well as
severity, duration and nature, of the nutritional insult. In
sheep, both maternal undernutrition around the time of
conception and a high plane of nutrition in a young
mother still growing herself result in impaired maternal
metabolic adaptation to pregnancy, and hence greater
substrate distribution to maternal at the expense of
conceptus tissue accretion. Maternal nutrition in early
pregnancy also determines subsequent growth and body
composition of the offspring, with mild-moderate
maternal undernutrition resulting in offspring of normal
body weight at birth but with increased weight of fat
depots thereafter. Undernutrition in late pregnancy
commonly reduces offspring birthweight, and this in
turn affects later growth and body composition. After
birth, growth of different tissues is strongly influenced
by both prior and current nutritional experiences. Lambs
of lower birthweight take longer to start to gain weight
after birth. They also require a higher feed intake to
attain a given weight gain, and more of that weight is
gained as fat and less as muscle compared with lambs of
higher birthweight. However for a given birthweight,
slower postnatal weight gain is generally associated with
a proportionately greater muscle growth. Rate of growth
also determines other aspects of body composition.
Muscle fibre number, which limits final muscle size, is
generally determined before birth, and indeed before the
last trimester of pregnancy in many species. Lambs
growing rapidly either before or after birth tend to have
proportionately larger livers, whereas chronically slow
growth is associated with reduced liver size relative to
body weight. Similar patterns are seen in the
lymphoreticular tissues such as spleen and thymus. It
seems likely that these variations in body composition
will have important functional consequences for later
health and wellbeing.

Science, University of The Basque Country, Vitoria,

Background and Aims: There are critical periods
during childhood that influence the development of
obesity, including gestation and early infancy. Size at
birth and early postnatal growth are determinants of
adult height and body mass index. The aim of this study
was to assess if birth weight has any effect on body
composition and/or fat distribution in adolescents.
Methods: Body composition was assessed by both
skinfold thickness measurements and dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) in 234 adolescents born at term
(140 females and 94 males), now aged 13-18 y and
living in the city of Zaragoza (AVENA-Zaragoza
cohort). Relative fat distribution was estimated with the
ratio of the subscapular to triceps skinfolds (S/T). Birth
weight and gestational age were assessed by means of a
questionnaire, considering the paediatric neonatal
records.
Results: Birth weight was inversely associated with S/T
ratio (P<0.05) in males and directly associated with
bone mass (P<0.01) and fat free mass (P<0.05) in
females. This association was independent of age,
Tanner stage, gestational age, socioeconomic status,
physical activity and height.
Conclusions: In adolescents born at term, genetic
and/or intrauterine environmental factors that influence
foetal growth and are reflected in birth weight have long
term consequences on bone and muscle mass, measured
by DXA, in females and in subcutaneous fat distribution
in males.
PROGRAMMING OF OBESITY AND INSULIN
RESISTANCE: THE EFFECT OF EARLY CATCH
UP GROWTH – LESSONS FROM ANIMAL
MODELS
C Remacle, B Reusens
Institute of Life Science, University of Louvain,
Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium
Background and Aims: A body of evidence now
suggests that poor intrauterine milieu elicited by
maternal nutritional disturbance or placental
insufficiency may programme susceptibility in the fetus
to later develop chronic degenerative disease such as
diabetes, obesity, hypertension and cardio-vascular
disease. The compatibility of early postnatal nutrition
with fetal experience will also be decisive for the rate of
occurrence of degenerative disease.
Methods: The understanding of mechanisms underlying
the programming of the metabolic syndrome is now
progressing thanks to animal studies in which the fetal
and neonatal environment has been manipulated.
Results: Similarly to data from epidemiological studies
in humans, obesity in rodent models arises principally in
offspring submitted to malnutrition in early stages of
gestation and which presented an early catch-up growth.
Four different pathways for programming obesity may
be proposed: 1) programming central circuits in the
hypothalamic area controlling feeding and metabolism,
2) modification of energy expenditure, 3) generation of
a hormonal context favouring adipose tissue
development, 4) modification of the pools of fat cell
precursors which should lead to hypertrophic /
hyperplastic obesity. These pathways and their
respective importance according to the time-window of
exposure and the type of malnutrition are now subject to
intense study. Studies on the progressive appearance of
insulin resistance in rodents which had been growth-
retarded in utero revealed an increased sensitivity of
target tissues to insulin in young adults, followed by
insulin resistance in older age. The insulin resistance
was associated with changes in expression of key
components of the insulin-signalling cascade in muscle
and adipocytes. The changes in expression of such
molecular markers have been detected also in muscle
- 2 -
and fat biopsies of men with a low birth weight. Possible
molecular mechanisms involved in nutritional
programming are just starting to emerge, such as early
definitive changes in the organelle central to energy
utilisation, i.e. mitochondria, or epigenetic changes in
nuclear DNA.
Conclusions: Animal models provide efficient tools to
reveal the time windows of nutritional experience in
early life favouring later obesity, as well as to decipher
progressively physiological and molecular mechanisms
involved in such metabolic programming.

HUMAN GENOME: IMPLICATIONS FOR
CLINICAL PRACTICE
J-J Cassiman
Center for Human Genetics, University of Leuven,
Belgium
The complete and detailed sequence of a representative
sample of human DNA is almost fully known, except
for a few stretches of hard to sequence DNA. This
historic achievement has already generated a few
surprises. The number of genes (about 25,000) hidden in
the 3 billion nucleotides that make up the human
genome is much smaller than initially expected and is
only slightly higher than in flies, while the total protein
coding sequence is only about 3% of the genome. The
OMIM register at www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Omim/ lists
more than 12,000 entries for monogenic or Mendelian
diseases, including 60 mitochondrial diseases. More
than 7,000 of these have been already mapped to a
particular chromosomal region, while another 2,000
have a definite gene locus. The remaining entries are
only phenotypic descriptions or other entries. The
molecular basis of these diseases is rapidly being
uncovered. In some genes one or a few defects are
responsible for a particular phenotype; in others,
mutations can be scattered all over the gene e.g. the
more than 1000 different mutations in the CFTR gene in
cystic fibrosis. The majority of our normal traits and
diseases are inherited in a multifactorial fashion. This
means that a series of genes (usually tens of genes) are
involved, due to either normal variation in their
sequence or real dysfunctional mutations. In addition,
environmental factors modulate the way in which these
genes influence the final phenotype. Traits inherited in
this fashion are mainly quantitative (measurable) traits
such as height, weight, IQ etc. and show a normal
(Gaussian) distribution in the population. Lamarck, who
in the 19th century claimed that acquired traits can be
inherited, has taken a little revenge in recent years.
Some examples have been found of how nutritional
factors can condition DNA and affect future
generations. As our understanding of the human genome
increases, it has become increasingly clear that our
knowledge is at present largely insufficient to attempt to
explain all the phenotypic variability observed between
individuals affected by the same disease. It is only
gradually that we will unravel all the genetic and
environmental factors responsible for this variability.
Nevertheless, many families can already be helped by
genetic testing in order to identify with precision what
the nature of the disease is and what the recurrence risks
are. Even fairly precise prediction of the risk to develop
a disease in adult life (presymptomatic diagnosis) or of
the susceptibility to develop serious multifactorial
diseases, such as hereditary breast or colorectal cancer,
is available. Nevertheless we have to guarantee our
clients that these tests are done with the best quality
available and in the context of appropriate genetic
counseling.
GENES AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCE IN
ASTHMA AND ATOPY
R Nickel
Department of Pediatric Pneumology and Immunology,
Charité, Berlin, Germany
Background and Aims: Despite a strong genetic basis
for asthma and atopy, no genetic marker(s)
unambiguously associated with atopy-related traits has
yet been identified. Variants in > 100 candidate genes
were associated with atopy-related traits. However,
replication (at least twice) was reported for less than 30
genes. Discrepant results may partly be attributed type 1
and type 2 errors due to small sample sizes or no
correction for multiple tests. Also, different ethnicities
of study populations have to be considered. There is
growing evidence that gene-by-gene- and gene-by-
environment interactions strongly influence disease
susceptibility and that single variant association studies
are not sufficient to identify the genetic basis for atopic
disorders. With regard to the development of asthma and
atopy, environmental factors (e.g. factors associated
with living on a farm, allergen exposure, infections)
appear to be particularly important very early in life.
Methods: Therefore, many gene-by-environment-
interaction studies have been performed in pediatric
populations and birth cohorts.
Results: Strong evidence for interactions has been
presented for genes involved in LPS (lipopoly-
saccharide) binding and signalling: One of the most
extensively examined candidate gene for atopy is CD14,
coding for a receptor for LPS. A CD14 promoter variant
was associated with both, low and high total serum IgE
levels (tIgE), other studies showed no effect on tIgE.
Recent studies that focused on CD14 genotypes and
endotoxin exposure suggest strong gene-by-environment
interactions with the CD14 variant being either
protective or a risk factor for asthma or increased tIgE
dependent on low or high endotoxin exposure. Toll like
receptor (TLR) genes have also been investigated in
asthma and atopy. TLRs are crucial for recognition of
microbial pattern associated molecules. A TLR2 variant
was associated with a decreased risk for asthma, but this
effect was exclusively seen in children living on a farm,
also implying a gene-by-environment interaction.
Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure has been
intensely investigated in gene-by-environment
interaction studies. An example is studies of an IL13
variant within a large German birth cohort. Significant
associations with tIgE and a common promoter variant
were observed at any age from 1 to 7 years. ETS
exposure in utero and/or infancy resulted in even higher
tIgE in children homozygous for the variant, but with no
effect on tIgE in the remaining children.
Conclusions: ETS-, endotoxin- and allergen exposure
are important environmental factors with regard to
asthma and atopy. Exposure can be assessed and
quantified in standardized procedures. Other factors that
- 6 -
may contribute to the increased prevalence of atopy (and
therefore of interest for gene-by-environment interaction
studies) are harder to assess in a standardized fashion
(e.g. diet, infections, medication, stress), which is an
ongoing effort of current birth cohort studies in our
division. Taken together, genetic studies of asthma and
atopy not only require large carefully characterized,
ethnically homogeneous study populations, but also data
on environmental exposure such as endotoxin, ETS and
allergens. Birth cohorts are particularly valuable for
gene-by-environment interaction studies since exposure
can be assessed in early infancy, a most vulnerable
period of life with regard to the development of asthma
and atopy.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF SYSTEMS
BIOLOGY AND HIGH-THROUGHPUT
TECHNOLOGY IN PEDIATRICS
M Benson
Department of Pediatrics, Queen Silvia Children's
Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden
Background and Aims: Complex diseases like
diabetes, allergy and cancer depend on multiple
interacting genes. It is probably not possible to find a
key gene in such diseases, a “silver bullet” that can be
used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. New
technologies, like DNA microarrays allow simultaneous
analysis of expression of all human genes. We have
applied these technologies and systems biology to
allergic rhinitis. The clinical aim is to identify markers
for treatment response. It is possible that similar
principles are generally applicable to complex diseases.
Methods: DNA microarrays, clique-based graph
algorithms, pathway analysis, real-time PCR,
immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, SNP analysis
Results: Getting a functional understanding of the large
datasets generated by DNA microarray studies of
complex diseases is a significant challenge. One such
study may identify hundreds or even thousands of genes
that differ in expression between patients and controls.
While this may be seen as discouraging it does reflect
the complexity of the diseases that we study. Moreover,
if we can get a grip on this complexity this may be used
for clinical purposes, for example to find combinations
of markers for individualized therapy. Systems biology
is an emerging discipline that aims to understand how
complex systems relate to biological effects. One
important theoretical framework is network-based
analysis. In the context of DNA microarray studies,
genes that differ in expression between patients and
controls are organized in gene interaction networks.
Such networks can be analyzed in a top-down fashion.
The idea is the same as a microscopic examination. You
start with a low magnification to identify general
features of the sample and then proceed to detailed
studies of individual cells. A gene interaction network
can be analyzed to find sub-networks or pathways with
distinct functions, such as cell proliferation or apoptosis.
These sub-networks can be further dissected to find up-
stream genes with putative key regulatory functions.
Typically, several sub-networks or pathways are
involved in complex diseases. However, a top-down
analysis may result in identification of combinations of
key genes that can be used for clinical purposes, such as
to find markers for personalized medication. In this
presentation examples from our own research in allergic
disease will be given, as well as from oncological
research. In the latter case customized DNA microarrays
are tried to find gene expression signatures for
personalized medication in breast cancer.
Conclusions: High-throughput studies and systems
biology may contribute to understanding of complex
diseases. A clinical implication may be identification of
markers for personalized medication.
WRITING FOR SUCCESS: OR EVERYTHING I
WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT GETTING
PUBLISHED BUT WAS AFRAID TO ASK!
J W Albarran
University of the West of England, Bristol, UK
Background and Aims: Nurses, whether as academics
or practitioners are increasingly required to disseminate
the findings of research or share ideas and examples of
best practice through publication. Lack of confidence,
time and familiarity with different journal house-styles
are often cited as barriers. These issues will be
considered. Moreover, writing informatively and in an
accessible format is not easy, but it can be learned
through following certain principles, commitment, time
and enthusiasm [1-2]. Aim: The purpose of this
workshop is for delegates to understand how to develop
a successful strategy that will lead to publication in a
peer-reviewed journal.
Methods: The workshop will address the following
areas:
1) Choosing a topic area
2) Decisions about choosing journal (impact factors and
dissemination)
3) Preparing the manuscript (conventions for research
and non-research papers)
4) Multiple publications from research projects
5) Authorship and co-authorship
6) Dealing with reviewers comments
Results: The workshop will be based on a power-point
presentation but delegates will be expected to participate
through open discussion and questions to explore a wide
range of other related issues.
Conclusions: The conclusion will summarise the seven
key stages on preparing a paper for publication
including the importance of considering international
readers.

THE ROLE OF A HOSPITAL PLAY SPECIALIST
IN ENSURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF
LONG-TERM VENTILATED CHILDREN ON AN
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT
L Bassett, C M Pierce
- 7 -
Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Great
Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: Play therapy has been part of
the intensive care service in our hospital since 1996.
Hospital Play Specialists (HPS) work as part of the
multidisciplinary and psychosocial team within the
intensive care unit. We reviewed our experience of play
therapy in long-term patients whilst on intensive care.
Methods: We performed a review of long-term
ventilated patients on our intensive care unit, between
2002-2006 in which we routinely devised 'play
programmes'. The average stay was 12 months. Reason
for contact and outcome were reviewed.
Results: The HPS assessed the child's needs and
devised appropriate programmes for them, which fit a
daily routine. The programme ensured appropriate
stimulation as well as establishing periods of rest and
sleep, whilst still appreciating the child's medical and
nursing input. The programmes changed to fit the child's
development and looked at the psychosocial needs of
the child and the family whilst requiring intensive care.
Examples are given.
Conclusions: A play specialist can become an integral
part of the intensive care unit working alongside the
medical and nursing staff to improve the long-term
patient's development. The HPS teaches nurses and
parents to play within the intensive care environment.
The HPS works with the long-term patient, their family
and the intensive care staff to overcome issues such as
behaviour, eating, and communication problems. The
Play Specialist meets the patient's needs through play;
they provide fun and stimulation trying to provide some
normality in an otherwise stressful and frightening
environment.

5. Disrespect of hospital procedure and staff
SENIOR CLOWNS
1. Being Insensitive
2. Being on an ego trip
3. Not connecting and relatives or staff saying the child
hates clowns when in fact they themselves do
4. Bad communication, not having enough time,
working with no feeling and ignoring the child's feelings
5. Not judging the situation, when a child is diagnosed
as the terminally ill/dying, lack of information on the
child's status and not feeling at your best
Conclusions: This report of the perceptions of Clown
Doctors has shown that there are a number of elements
which enhance a clown doctor encounter with a sick
child.
CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND GENES: A BRIEF
HISTORY, BUT A LOT OF NEWS
S Cunningham
Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal
Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, UK
Cystic Fibrosis, first described in 1938, was quickly
recognised, like so many other conditions as being of
autosomal recessive inheritance. There was
understandable great excitement surrounding the
discovery in 1989 of DeltaF508, the most common gene
mutation for cystic fibrosis. As a recessive single gene
defect disease the possibility of replacing the defective
gene was a stimulating prospect. Seventeen years later,
whilst other single gene defects have been corrected, a
solution to the cystic fibrosis gene defect remains
unresolved. The reasons for this lack of resolution are
frustrating to patients and clinicians, but have opened
novel and fruitful research directions. What can be so
complex about this single gene defect? Firstly, there
isn't just one gene defect, there are no more than 1000
genes identified associated with cystic fibrosis, falling
into five functional classes. Secondly, we have become
increasingly aware that the interplay of ancillary
'modifier' genes play an important but as yet poorly
quantified effect on the principle gene defect. Thirdly,
as with other diseases, the complex evolving phenotype
of cystic fibrosis, incorporates the interplay of genotype
and environment, together with the possible role of
epigenetics (heritable changes in gene function that
occur without a change in the DNA sequence). Together
these factors add a substantial complexity to what was
considered a simple model of disease. Into this
environment, the next generation of pulmonary trials for
correction of the cystic fibrosis gene defect are now
being planned. The first pulmonary trials were
successful (in that gene transfer occurred), but not
- 8 -
enough and side effects too many. Important lessons
were learnt, and following a hiatus to reform the whole
infrastructure of the gene delivery systems further trials
are now planned. There are expected additional
problems in children, not least of which is how will we
know if gene transfer works. Yet children are considered
the linchpin to the success of such studies (repairing the
defect before major pulmonary injury has occurred) and
research is underway to ensure that children should not
be disenfranchised from this major biotechnological
advance.

Background and Aims: Chorioamnionitis is known to
play a central role in its pathogenesis of
bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In clinical practice,
glucocorticoids are used before a premature birth for
their role in pulmonary maturation, decreasing the risk
of morbidity and mortality. However, some animal
studies suggest that they may also have adverse effects
on alveolar development. In this context, we
hypothesized that glucorticoids could major
alveolarization impairment caused by chorioamnionitis.
Methods: We used a model of Escherichia coli
chorioamnionitis in rabbits. Pregnant females (n=20)
receiving an intrauterine inoculation with 103 E. Coli on
day 25 of gestation received antibiotics and either one or
two doses of betamethasone (0,1 mg/kg/dose) or saline
serum, 6 hours after inoculation. Surviving foetuses
were studied at first day after normal delivery. Alveolar
development was compared between the three groups
performing morphometric analysis (n=31).
Inflammatory process was analyzed measuring
cellularity in amniotic fluid and bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid.
Results: With one or two doses of bethamethasone
versus saline serum, a statistically higher mortality rate
(p<0,001) was found and birth weight and lung volume
were significantly decreased (p<0,05). With two doses
of glucocorticoids versus one dose and versus saline
serum, specific alveolar area, intersticium volume,
elastin fibers length and blood vessels volume were
decreased (p<0,05), and alveolar airspace volume was
increased (p<0,05). No significant difference was found
in inflammatory process.
Conclusions: Glucocorticoids major significantly
infectious-induced alveolar impairment in this
experimental model of evolutive antenatal infection,
which confirms their serious potential long term adverse
effects on the preterm lung.

Background and Aims: Little is known about the
structural substrate causing pulmonary abnormalities in
patients with BPD. Aims: First: To develop a scoring
system to standardize the description of lung-CT scans
in BPD. Second: To study long term structural changes
on CT scans in BPD in relation to lung function and
neonatal risk factors.
Methods: Retrospective analysis of lung-CT scans in
BPD. Patients received a lung-CT scan when indicated
by the paediatric pulmonologist. CT scans were scored
for: decreased density/hypovascularity (0-3 points);
linear opacities (0-3 points); bullae (0-3 points); air
trapping (0-1 point); consolidations (0-3 points);
bronchiectasis (0-1 point), and airway wall thickening
(0-1 point). The maximum score could be 85 (=100%).
Three independent readers scored all scans to determine
the reproducibility.
Results: 37 BPD patients were identified. Age at CT
was 2 months to 17 years. Mean CT score was 27%
(range 4-53%). Inter- and intra-observer agreement,
assessed by the intra-class correlation coefficient, was
good (ICC from 0.830 to 0.933). The mean CT score
correlated positively with the mean alveolar pressure
during mechanical ventilation at 24 hours after birth
(R=0.588, p<0.008), and the days of O2 need
postnatally (R=0.530, p<0.002). The mean CT score
correlated negatively with the FEV1 (R=-0.612,
p<0.002).
Conclusions: CT scans in BPD show structural
abnormalities and can be scored in a standardized
reproducable way. The CT score correlated with classic
neonatal risk factors for BPD and lung function at later
age. A prospective study on CT scans in BPD should be
performed in the new era of neonatal care.

Background and Aims: Exercise is a frequently cited
trigger for asthma symptoms in childhood. Any barrier
to physical activity has implications for weight
management and emotional wellbeing. This study aims
to investigate the impact of asthma on children’s
customary activity, body mass index (BMI) and mental
health.
Methods: A controlled, cross-sectional study of
children aged 7-14 attending hospital outpatient clinics,
either for asthma (n=56), or for ENT or dermatological
conditions (n=61). Measures were BMI and
International Task Force classification of obesity.
Parent-rated Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire
(SDQ) assessed children’s mental health and child-rated
Physical Activity Questionnaire (PAQ) assessed total
sedentary and physical activities in previous 24 hours.
Results: The groups were well matched for
demographic variables. The asthma group had higher
BMI (p=0.008) and 21.4% were obese compared to
6.6% in the non-asthma group (OR 3.89, 95% CI 1.17-
12.88). Children with asthma reported fewer physical
activities (p=0.002) but comparable levels of sedentary
activities. Obese children were less active (p=0.008) but
regression analysis showed asthma was the strongest
predictor of lower activity scores, followed by younger
age (adjusted r2 =0.104). The asthma group had higher
levels of emotional difficulties (p=0.05) and, within this
group, PAQ scores negatively correlated with SDQ
scores indicating that more active children had better
mental health (p=0.009). More parents (60.7%) and
children (66.1%) in the asthma group identified the
child’s health as a barrier to exercise compared to the
non-asthma group (p<0.001).
Conclusions: Interventions to promote physical activity
in children with asthma may reduce the risk of obesity
and improve mental health.

Background and Aims: Indomethacin (IN) is used for
PDA closure, but its use is associated with changes in
pulmonary vascular tone. These effects may be due to
endothelin-1 (ET-1). We compared the effects of early
postnatal IN and ibuprofen (IB) on ET-1 and big ET-1
levels in the rat lungs.
Methods: Newborn rats (n=15/group) received IP
injections at birth (P1), P2, and P3 of either saline (Sal);
0.2 mg/kg IN on P1 followed by 0.1 mg/kg on P2 and
P3; 1.0 mg/kg IN on P1 followed by 0.5 mg/kg on P2
and P3; 10 mg/kg IB on P1 followed by 5 mg/kg on P2
and P3; and 50 mg/kg IB on P1 followed by 25 mg/kg
on P2 and P3. At birth, P14 and P21, lung ET-1 and big
ET-1 levels were examined.
Results: ET-1 levels were higher than big ET-1 levels
and remained unchanged from birth through P21 in the
controls. In contrast, big ET-1 levels increased at P14
compared to birth (p<0.05) and P21 (p<0.05). Low-dose
IN increased ET-1 levels compared to Sal (p<0.01),
low-dose IB (p<0.001), high-dose IB (p<0.001), and
high-dose IN (p<0.001). Big ET-1 levels were lower in
all treatment groups (p<0.01).
Conclusions: Suppression of big ET-1 with IN and IB
suggest an interaction between COX and endothelin.
Changes in pulmonary vascular tone with therapeutic
doses of IN may be due to increased production of ET-1.
IB does not have similar effects on pulmonary ET-1
levels.

Hospital, Rome, Italy
Background and Aims: Laryngomalacia is the most
common cause of stridor in infants. Current treatment in
severe forms is aryepiglottoplasty. Little is known about
its effects on respiratory function. The aim was to
evaluate changes in breathing pattern after
aryepiglottoplasty in infants with severe laryngomalacia.
Methods: Twenty infants were studied before and 4-6
weeks after laser CO2 aryepiglottoplasty.
Laryngomalacia was diagnosed clinically and by
laryngo-tracheal endoscopy. Breathing pattern was
studied with an ultrasonic flow-meter measuring: Tidal
Volume (Vt), Respiratory Rate (RR), Time to peak
expiratory flow/expiratory time ratio (tPTEF/Te, an
index of lower airways patency), Mean Expiratory/Mean
Inspiratory Flow ratio (MEF/MIF, an index of upper
airways patency). The patients underwent laser CO2
ariepiglottoplasty and following the procedure were kept
intubated for 24 hrs. The comparison between pre (T1)
and post aryepiglottoplasty (T2) test was done by the
Student's t-test for paired values.
Results: Values are expressed as means ± SD. Infants
were studied at 2.9±1.7 (T1) and 4.5±1.8 (T2) months of
age. Before surgery the breathing pattern was
characterized by low tidal volumes and high tPTEF/Te
and MEF/MIF ratios. After surgery these variables
improved significantly (T1 vs T2: Vt=5.5±1.7 vs 8.0
ml/kg, p<0.001; tPTEF/te=0.34±0.11 vs 0.23±0.11,
p<0.005; MEF/MIF=1.6±0.8 vs 0.9±0.2, p<0.001)
reaching age specific normal values. The surgical
procedure was well tolerated in all infants and no peri-
operative or long term complications were observed.
Conclusions: Laser CO2 aryepiglottoplasty in infancy
is safe and effective and significantly improves
pulmonary function at least in the short term.

Background and Aims: Besides old classification of
Chronic Lung Disease (CLD) - O2-dependency at 36
weeks of postmenstrual age-, recently a new definition
for CLD has been proposed: New Bronchopulmonary-
Dysplasia (BPD), which uses total duration of O2
supplementation and positive pressure requirements to
delineate three degrees of severity: mild, moderate and
severe, according to the respiratory status at 36 weeks
post-menstrual age. Objective of this report is to analyse
the balance of serum pro-inflammatory and pro-
fibrotic/angiogenic cytokine concentrations in relation to
CLD or New BPD definition.
Methods: Thirty-one preterm neonates with a
gestational age of 24 to 29 weeks, previously enrolled in
a randomized clinical trial to compare the effects of
high-frequency oscillatory ventilation versus
intermittent mandatory ventilation in terms of
pulmonary mechanics and lung cytokines, were actually
studied to evaluate their serum cytokine concentration.
At days 1, 3 and 5 after birth, serum samples were
collected until extubation to detect the levels of three
pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1) plus
four profibrotic/angiogenic cytokines (IL-10, TGF- 1,
VEGF, PDGF-BB), and correlation was made with old
CLD or New BPD development.
Results: Ventilation treatments were homogeneously
distributed between the groups and did not interfere with
the results presented here. Old CLD development,
mainly corresponding to the moderate/severe forms of
New BPD, was associated with increased pro-
inflammatory and profibrotic/angiogenic cytokines,
while mild forms of New BPD were only characterized
by increases of pro-fibrotic/angiogenic cytokines.
Conclusions: These data suggest a different balance of
two pathogenic mechanisms in different phases of the
disease.

Background and Aims: TNF-alpha -308 (G/A) has
been associated with increased levels of TNF-alpha,
involved in the BPD development. TGF-beta1-800
(G/A) is in linkage disequilibrium with TGF-beta1-509,
associated with increased production of TGF-beta1, a
marker of fibrotic response in BPD.
Methods: PCR analyses were performed with DNA
extracted from whole blood samples on 55 newborns
with GA <32 wks. 27 newborns with BPD (GA=26.7+/-
1.8wks; BW=821+/-223g) and 28 controls (GA=29.5+/-
1.7wks; BW=1274+/-358g p<0.0001) were studied.
Results: The AA and GA TNF-alpha-308 and the GA
TGF-beta1-800 genotypes occurred more frequently in
infants with BPD (p=0.58 and p=0.54 respectively).
Subdividing newborns according to their genotype,
duration of mechanical ventilation and O2-therapy was
longer in the group TNF-alpha-308 AA/GA and TGF-
beta1-800 GA respect to GG groups (Tab 1-2).
Conclusions: TNF-alpha-308 and TGF-beta1-800
polymorphisms may play a role in susceptibility to
VILI.

Background and Aims: There is no evidence about the
production of neutrophilic alpha-defensins (HNP 1-4) in
preterms BALF and their role as anti-inflammatory
markers.
Methods: We collected 31 BALF samples in 2nd and
3rd day of life from 21 ventilated neonates with RDS
and GA <35 weeks. In 10 patients a second sample was
collected in 5th or 7th day. The mass spectrometry ESI-
ION TRAP plus HPLC have been used for qualitative
and semiquantitative analysis (Massa Area with EIC) of
the alpha-defensins.
- 11 -
Results: The studied population was divided in 2
groups: one of 8 neonates (GA: 27,9+/-4,1 weeks; BW:
1192+/-760 g) with pneumonia in the first week of life
and one of 13 controls (GA: 28,5+/-3,2 weeks; BW:
1190+/-599 g). The alpha-defensins's sum and the
number of PMN have been found significantly higher in
the pneumonia group (Fig.1). Especially in the
pneumonia group, exists a positive significant
correlation between the absolute number of PMN in
BALF and the levels corresponding to semiquantitative
sum of defensins (Fig.2).
Conclusions: These data confirm the prevalent
neutrophilic origin of alpha-defensins and the capacity
of response of immune system during infections in
preterm infants.
RESEARCH IN MEDICINES FOR CHILDREN:
THE NEW REGULATION AND THE ROLE OF
THE EMEA
D Brasseur
University Children's Hospital Queen Fabiola, Brussels,
Belgium and Chair of CHMP/Paediatric Expert Group
at the European Medicines Agency (EMEA), London,
UK
The European Union has since June 2006 a Regulation
on 'Better Medicines for Children'. Currently the
provisions of the text await final implementation: the
new system should be operational in Q2 of 2007 at the
latest. The purposes are to facilitate and increase the
development of medicines for children, promote a high
quality of research, consolidate the ethical approach of
clinical trials. The system hits inevitably new products
at first submission or if claiming a new indication, a new
route of administration, a new dosage or a new
pharmaceutical form. The system is optional for
unpatented drugs. Those still patented get a 6 months
extension of their protection, the others a 10 years
paediatric registration if they comply with the paediatric
investigational plan (PIP). The PIP intents to assure
availability of data and an age appropriate formulation.
PIP means a research and development programme
intended to obtain a paediatric indication. PIP will
specify the timing and measures proposed to assess the
quality, safety and efficacy in all subsets of the
paediatric populations possibly concerned. The scope of
the PIP includes the formulation(s), the preclinical
safety, the clinical efficacy, the pharmaco-vigilance and
any appropriate risk management plan. The timing of
the PIP should be precised. In specific circumstances a
PIP will be waived (likelihood of inefficacy, safety
concerns, conditions occurring in adults only, or some
ages groups might be waived [neonates…]). The PIP
will be assessed by a Paediatric Committee (PECO)
where each member state will be represented, as will be
healthcare professionals and patients/parents (groups).
The PECO will assess the proposed PIP and an
agreement (or deferral/waiver) should be reached before
the submission of the adult (part of the) dossier. If no
discussion of PECO is included in a new application, the
adult dossier cannot be validated. The PECO will also
define compliance criteria that the company should fulfil
before it can be decided that the requirements of the PIP
have been met. This compliance will condition the 6
months extension, whatever the final results of the
studies conducted. A failed PIP can thus lead to the
incentives, provided this 'negative' information is
incorporated in the product information. In order to
facilitate the conduct of the PIP the European Medicines
Agency (EMEA) has set a number of measures:
guidance on quality assessments of paediatric
formulations, guidance on preclinical toxicity studies in
juvenile animals, proposals on PK-PD studies and some
reflection on the paediatric specificity of pharmaco-
vigilance and risk minimisation.

Background and Aims: Opioids are the current
standard for treating moderate and severe NAS.
Clonidine is used widely as a non-opioid alternative for
managing opioid withdrawal in adults. To determine
whether clonidine in combination with tapering doses of
DTO will significantly reduce the length of therapy and
the amount of opioids used in infants with NAS.
Methods: 80 Infants with history of maternal
methadone or heroin use during pregnancy, having 2
consecutive modified Finnegan Scores (MFS) 9 were
randomized to receive clonidine (Duraclon, 1 mcg/kg
q4h) or placebo. Excluded infants were <35 weeks
gestational age, <5th% birthweight, breastfeeding. DTO
dose was increased in 6 steps from 0.2ml q4h up to
0.9ml q3h if 2 consecutive MFS 9. Infants with 2
consecutive MFS 9 on 0.9ml q3h were classified as
- 12 -
treatment failure. Infants were monitored for
hypotension, bradycardia, and oxygen desaturations.
Results: 40 infants were assigned to two groups, that
were similar with regard to maternal and infant
demographic factors. The median length of therapy was
23% shorter for infants in the clonidine group compared
to placebo (11.5±1.8 vs. 14.9±1.2 days, logrank,
p<0.05). The maximum daily dose of DTO tended to be
less (2.4±2.4ml vs. 3.4±2.7ml) (P=0.10) in the clonidine
group. The placebo group had more seizures (3 vs. 0)
and a higher rate of treatment failure (5 vs. 0). Other
adverse events (hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia,
desaturations) were not significantly different.
Conclusions: Clonidine in combination with DTO is
safe and more efficacious than DTO alone for the
treatment of moderate to severe NAS. Supported by
NIDA#IR21DAO16288.

Background and Aims: Indomethacin and ibuprofen
are drugs that are commonly used to treat a patent
ductus arteriosus in premature infants. These drugs are
known to cause acute renal failure in up to 25% of
infants treated. Infants are usually treated between 24-28
weeks gestation at a time when glomerulogenesis is still
occurring. To determine whether there are renal
glomerular and tubular changes found on electron
microscopy (EM) following administration of
indomethacin and ibuprofen to rat pups.
Methods: Rat pups were administered indomethacin
0.1mg/kg or 0.2 mg/kg or ibuprofen 5 mg/kg or 10
mg/kg intraperitoneally for 5 days from day 1 of life
(equivalent to 24-26 weeks gestation in the human).
Control groups consisted of no drug administration and
normal saline administered intraperitoneally. The pups
were sacrificed using carbon dioxide at 14 days of age,
equivalent to term in the human. The systemic
circulation was perfused with heparinized saline,
papaverine, normal saline and fixed with 2.5%
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer. Three
sections were taken for EM examination.
Results: Six pups were included in each group. There
were no glomerular or tubular anomalies in either the
control or the saline group. Mitochondrial changes were
seen in the tubules in both the indomethacin and
ibuprofen treated animals. Changes to the foot processes
and basement membrane of the glomeruli were seen in
both the indomethacin and ibuprofen treated groups.
Conclusions: Indomethacin and ibuprofen affect both
glomeruli and tubules in the developing kidney.
ADENOSINE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF
PERSISTENT PULMONARY HYPERTENSION
OF THE NEWBORN?
T R Thiruchelvam, A J Petros, C M Pierce
Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street
Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: Persistent pulmonary
hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) causes significant
morbidity and mortality. Nitric oxide (iNO) reduces the
need for ECMO in these infants. Adenosine is a potent
pulmonary vasodilator that has also been used in PPHN.
We reviewed our experience of adenosine in this
population.
Methods: Retrospective review of case notes of
neonates admitted to our intensive care between Jan
2001 – Jan 2006 with clinical and echocardiographic
evidence of PPHN. Clinical demographics and therapy
were recorded.
Results: 192 cases of PPHN were admitted. All
received iNO, 26 were given adenosine (50μg/kg/min).
The median age of the whole group was 1d (1-2) and the
adenosine subset 1d (1-2): weights were 3.4kg (3.0-3.7)
and 3.3kg (3.3-3.37) respectively. Oxygenation index
(OI) was 54 (31.8-62) for the adenosine subset (n=26)
compared to 30 (16.4-46.8) for the whole group
(n=192). Adenosine recipients referred for ECMO
(n=10) had an OI of 65 (57-80) with no deaths vs. those
not given adenosine and referred to ECMO (n=39), 48.5
(27-62) (p=0.06), with 8 deaths (p=0.18 Fisher’s exact).
Those not referred to ECMO (n=16) had an OI of 42.5
(28.5-54) and 3 deaths vs. those who did not get
adenosine and not referred to ECMO (n=127), 24
(14-40) (p=0.014) with 15 deaths (p=0.42).
Conclusions: The group receiving adenosine had a
higher OI before needing ECMO, without a higher
mortality rate. Those not needing ECMO also had a
higher OI. Adenosine reduced the need for ECMO. We
need a randomised controlled trial to elucidate the role
of adenosine in PPHN.
USE AND MISUSE OF CORTICOSTEROIDS IN
THE PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT
D Mul, J J Verhoeven, K F M Joosten
Department of Pediatric Intensive Care, Erasmus MC-
Sophia, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Corticosteroid (CS) treatment
is used for several indications in the pediatric intensive
care unit (PICU). However, consensus on which CS to
use and/or its dose is frequently lacking. Given the well
known side-effects of CS on several metabolic and
endocrine pathways careful use of CS should be
considered.
Methods: Retrospective analysis of the use of CS in our
PICU during a random 11-months period in 2005.
Indications, type of CS and dosing values were
collected.
Results: In 109 of 520 PICU admissions (21%) CS were
used. Indications are summarised in the table. Sixty-one
percent of patients were male, mean age was 4.0 yrs
(SD 4.8). Median cumulative dosage (mg/kg) during
- 13 -
admission was 3,2 for prednisone, 1,1 for
dexamethasone and 5,8 for hydrocortisone. For all CS, a
wide range in cumulative dose was observed, mainly
skewed to the higher values: ranges were 0,5-11,2
mg/kg for prednison, 0,2-7,7 mg/kg for dexamethasone
and 1,4 – 30,4 mg/kg for hydrocortisone.
Conclusions: In 21% of PICU admissions, CS were
used in various doses; the choice of CS for specific
indications were not uniform. Cumulative CS doses
differ considerably within identical indications, and
reach values with higher risk for occurrence of
side-effects in metabolic or endocrine pathways.

Background and Aims: The incidence and types of
acute poisonings in children changes over time. This
study was designed to evaluate the clinical course and
outcome of poisonings among children in Oslo, and
findings were compared to a similar study from 1980.
Methods: Prospective observational study including all
children <16 years of age with a main diagnosis of acute
poisoning admitted to hospital or the Central outpatient
clinic in Oslo during two years.
Results: 234 episodes (226 children) of acute poisoning
were included at outpatient clinic (97) or hospital (137).
Annual incidence was 1.2%, significantly lower than in
1980 (p<0.001). Toxic agents were pharmaceuticals
(42%), domestic products (30%) and plants or
mushrooms (16%) in younger children; older children
ingested ethanol (51%) and tablets (47%). No active
treatment was needed in 85% (outpatient clinic) and
26% (hospital). As in 1980, charcoal (40%), gastric
lavage (18%), and emetics (10%) were the most
common hospital treatment, though in reversed order.
Antidotes were only given to hospitalized children
(15%). 9% of all children were comatose. Complications
were seen in 17%, no differences regarding age, gender
or place of treatment. For details about older vs. younger
children, see table 1. All children survived without
sequelae.
Conclusions: Clinical outcome after acute poisonings in
children was good. Incidence was reduced since 1980.
Older children present with more severe poisonings than
younger.

Background and Aims: Movement and anxiety during
echocardiographic study may reduce the reliability and
compromise the quality of echocardiographic images;
sedation is essential component for the procedure
especially in infants. Purpose of this study: To evaluate
the acceptance and effectiveness of intranasal vs. oral
midazolam for infants during the transtorasic
echocardiography.
Methods: A randomized, prospective blinded placebo
controlled study. Seventy-four infants, between the ages
of 6 months to 3 years, presenting for elective
echocardiographic study were divided 3 groups. Oral
midazolam group (group 1) received 0.4 mg-kg-1 of
injectable midazolam mixed with an equal volume of
strawberry fruit, Intranasal midazolam group (group 2)
received 0.2 mg-kg-1, and placebo group (group 3)
received oral strawberry fruit or intranasal serum
physiologic. A blinded echocardiographer assessed the
sedation and echocardiographer's satisfaction scores for
each child, and score for the easiness of administration
was recorded by the nurse.
Results: Intranasal route was more willingly accepted
by infants than oral route (P < 0.001). There was not
significant differences between the group 1 and group 2
for the effect of sedation (P = 0.952), but a very
significant differences between the groups of 1 and 3, 2
and 3 for the echocardiographer's satisfaction (P < 0.001
and P < 0.005, respectively).
Conclusions: Although there was not difference of
sedation score between oral and nasal route, intranasal
midazolam was well accepted than oral midazolam by
infants, and proved that under the effect of midazolam,
echocardiography was studied easily and more reliable
compared the control group.

Background and Aims: ALLO inhibits xanthine
oxidase (XO) and thereby prevents formation of toxic
superoxide-radicals during P-HI and early reperfusion.
Postnatal ALLO does not seem neuroprotective,
probably because treatment is started too late to prevent
the XO-surge. Antenatal ALLO-administration to
mothers during P-HI may provide neuroprotection. This
study evaluated placental passage after ALLO-
administration to mothers during P-HI through
measurement of ALLO and oxypurinol (OXY)
concentrations in mothers and hypoxic fetuses. In a
previous study therapeutic levels (>4mg/L) were
reached in newborns after oral ALLO-administration of
600mg to women in uncomplicated labour (Boda 1999).
Methods: Pregnant ewes at 0.8 of gestation received a
single IV ALLO-dose of 900mg during intermittent
umbilical cord clamping. Women in labour with
GA>36wks and signs of fetal distress received a single
ALLO-dose of 500mg IV or 600mg orally. ALLO and
OXY concentrations were measured in maternal and
umbilical cord (UC) blood.
Results: Therapeutic levels were reached in the ewe and
sheep fetus. In humans iv-administration caused
therapeutic levels in the mother, whereas UC levels
were subtherapeutical. After oral administration levels
were extremely low.
Conclusions: During P-HI high dosed ALLO passes the
sheep placenta. However, iv-ALLO-administration in
humans during P-HI leads to suboptimal fetal levels
(unlike in fetuses without P-HI), probably because of a
compromised placental transfer. We conclude
therapeutic UC levels may be reached by increasing the
iv-dose and oral administration is not indicated in case
of P-HI.

Background and Aims: Propofol (PROP) is widely
used for sedation in children. Until today, there is an
ongoing debate whether PROP exhibits pro- or
anticonvulsant effects, and whether it should be used in
patients with epilepsy. This prospective study was done
to assess seizure like phenomena (SLP) and EEG
changes in children with epilepsy receiving PROP
sedation for MRI studies, and to compare these data to
non-epileptic children.
Methods: We prospectively assessed the occurrence of
SLP and the effects of PROP on the EEG in 25 children
with epilepsy and 25 children with mental retardation
undergoing sedation for MRI studies.
Results: In both groups, no child demonstrated SLP of
epileptic origin during and after PROP sedation.
Immediately after stopping PROP, characteristic EEG
changes in the epilepsy group consisted of increased
beta wave activity (23/25 children), and suppression of
pre-existing theta rhythms (11/16 children). In addition,
16 of 18 children with epilepsy and documented EEG
seizure activity demonstrated suppression of spike-wave
patterns after PROP sedation. In all 25 children with
mental retardation an increase in beta wave activity was
seen. Suppression of theta rhythms occurred in 11 of 12
children at the end of the MRI study. In no child of
either group, a primary occurrence, or an increase in
spike-wave patterns was seen following PROP
administration. The occurrence of beta wave activity
(mental retardation and epilepsy group) and suppression
of spike-wave patterns (epilepsy group) were transient,
and disappeared after 4 hours.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates characteristic,
time-dependent EEG patterns induced by PROP in
children with epilepsy and mental retardation. Our data
support the concept of PROP being a sedative-hypnotic
agent with anti-convulsant properties.

In this presentation we discuss the formation of the
synchronously contracting chambered heart from a
peristaltically contracting linear heart tube. It is
proposed that members of the T-box family of
transcription factors play a crucial role in the formation
of the building plan of the heart. Tbx5 confers cranio-
caudal polarity to the heart tube, whereas Tbx2 and
Tbx3 prevent the cardiac inflow tract, atrioventricular
region, outflow tract, as well as the cardiac inner
curvatures from chamber differentiation. With the
exception of the outflow tract that becomes incorporated
into the ventricles, these regions contribute to the
cardiac conduction system. Tbx1 specifically is involved
- 15 -
in the formation of the outflow tract, whereas Tbx18 is
involved in the formation of the systemic venous
tributaries. One of the most fascinating aspects in the
formation of the heart is the very early development of
the electrical patterning as can be registered by the
ECG, which is the registration of the rhythmic waves of
depolarising activity over the cardiac muscle. In the
mature heart the conduction system is responsible for
the rhythmic excitations and contractions. However, in
chicken embryos a sinusoidal type of ECG can already
be derived from the linear heart tube stages at about two
days of development, and less than one day later when
chamber formation has just been initiated, an adult type
of ECG can be monitored. The question can thus
justifiably be asked whether the presence of an adult
type of ECG in these early embryonic hearts implies the
presence of a conduction system. Generally, the
conduction system is defined as the system of
specialized myocardial tissues responsible for initiation
and propagation of the sinus impulse. If we accept this
functional definition, then the early embryonic heart has
a conduction system, which is already in place, because
there is an adult type of ECG. On the other hand, if we
would apply strict anatomical and histological
definitions, the embryonic heart undeniably lacks a
conduction system. This field of tension concerning the
recognition of the conduction system using
physiological versus anatomical / histological criteria
has led to many controversies in the field.. In this
contribution we discuss the specification of the
embryonic areas that will become chamber and those
areas that will not form chambers and participate in the
formation of the distinct components of the conduction
system. Another intriguing aspect is how during
evolution the cardiac components of the pulmonary
circulation evolved. Recently, a novel cardiac field, the
so-called secondary heart-forming field, has been
described. This field is localized centrally from the
classic cardiac crescent on the embryonic disc. We
discuss the view that the so-called second heart-forming
field contributes to the cardiac components of the
evolutionary new pulmonary circulation, being the right
ventricle and outflow tract as well as the mediastinal
myocardium, which gives rise to the atrial septum and
the dorsal wall of the left atrium. Both types of
myocardium are derived from the mesenchyme that is
localized centrally from the classic cardiac crescent.

Background and Aims: Cardiac output can be
measured using a modified carbon dioxide Fick (mCO2-
F) method. We performed a validation study comparing
mCO2-F method derived cardiac output (QmCO2F)
with measured pulmonary blood flow by an ultrasonic
flowprobe (Qufp).
Methods: The study was approved by the Ethical
Committee on Animal Research and performed in 7
random-bred newborn lambs (2.9 – 6.4 kg). The mCO2-
F method is based on the principle, that in a steady state
carbon dioxide production equals pulmonary carbon
dioxide exchange. Cardiac output was manipulated by
creating hemorrhagic hypotension. Bias, defined as
QmCO2F minus Qufp, was calculated for each
measurement. For every venous sampling site mean bias
with standard deviation (sd), 95% confidence intervals
and limits of agreement (LOA) were calculated. LOA
are defined as mean bias ± 1.96 sd.
Results: The table shows the mean bias in cardiac
output in l/min for the three different venous sample
sites (right atrium, superior vena cava and inferior vena
cava).
Conclusions: Measurement of cardiac output with the
mCO2-F method is reliable in newborn lambs and can
be used for trend monitoring. Venous blood sampling
from the right atrium, superior vena cava or inferior
vena cava can be used for this measurement. The
mCO2-F method is a promising technique that can be
used to measure cardiac output in critically ill newborns.

Background and Aims: Brain natriuretic peptide
(BNP) and Pro brain natriuretic peptide (Pro-BNP) are
useful markers of left ventricular function in adults and
are widely used to diagnose cardiac failure. Their use is
yet to be explored in neonates. Adequate left ventricular
function is vital to maintain sufficient systemic
perfusion in adults and possibly in preterm neonates. We
hypothesize that Pro-BNP can be a useful marker of left
ventricular function in neonates.
Methods: Preterm neonates less than 1500g and less
than 30 weeks were enrolled in the prospective blinded
study. Echocardiographic measurement of Stroke
- 16 -
volume (SV) and left ventricular output (LVO) were
carried out on days 1, 3, and five of life. Pro-BNP levels
were measured at the same time as echo measurement.
Results: Fifteen neonates [gestational age Mean (SD)
27 weeks (1.8), mean weight 1064g (213)] had 44 paired
echocardiography and pro-BNP determinations. Pro-
BNP ranged from 94 to 35353 pmol/L. 18 of 44
echocardiograms showed PDA. In 7 neonates (Group A
in table) average SV and LVO were significantly lower
than in the other 8 (Group B). Pro-BNP had a
statistically significant inverse relationship with both SV
and LVO.
Conclusions: Pro-BNP is a useful indicator of left
ventricular function in neonates. It may have a role in
distinguishing heart from respiratory disease, aid in the
decision of starting ionotropes and monitoring response
to treatment. It may also have a role in assessing
systemic perfusion as an adjunct to blood pressure
monitoring.

Background and Aims: Cardiac output (CO)
measurement in critically ill children is cumbersome,
but may improve haemodynamic management.
Transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) technique has
been used but validation in small children is limited.
This is the first study to compare TPTD with ultrasound
flow probes in a paediatric animal model.
Methods: We prospectively studied 9 mechanically
ventilated and sedated lambs with a median weight of
6.5 kg (4.7 – 12.5 kg) under various circulatory
conditions. TPTD measurements were performed with
ice-cold saline using the PiCCOplus system (Pulsion
Medical Systems). The mean of 4 consecutive
measurements with a normal TPTD curve were
compared to a simultaneous registration of an ultrasound
perivascular flowprobe around the pulmonary artery
(Transonic Systems Inc.).
Results: A total of 65 simultaneous measurements
fulfilled the quality control criteria and were analysed.
Mean CO was 1.8 l/min (range 0.72 – 3.6 l/min). The
figure depicts the Bland Altman analysis for the two
measurement techniques. Bias is 0.3 l/min with a
precision of 0.3 l/min. The correlation coefficient
(pearson) is 0.96 (p < 0.0001).
Conclusions: In this paediatric animal model
transpulmonary thermodilution provides an accurate
measurement of cardiac output, therefore it can be
useful as a monitoring tool in children with
haemodynamic instability.

Background and Aims: Left ventricular hypertrophy
may be partly originated in early life. The aim of this
study was to examine the associations of fetal growth
characteristics in the second and third trimester of
pregnancy and at birth with left cardiac structure in early
infancy.
Methods: This study was embedded in the Generation
R Study, a prospective population-based cohort study
from fetal life until adulthood. Fetal growth
characteristics were assessed by ultrasounds in each
trimester in pregnant women. Echocardiographic
follow-up studies were performed in a subgroup of 791
infants aged 6 weeks and 6 months.
Results: We did not find associations of second
trimester growth characteristics with postnatal cardiac
structures. Third trimester abdominal circumference was
positively associated with postnatal left ventricular mass
and aortic root diameter. For each SD increase in third
trimester abdominal circumference, left ventricular mass
increased by 0.33 (95% CI 0.059, 0.61) grams and aortic
root diameter increased by 0.13 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.22)
mm. Birth weight was associated with aortic root
diameter leading to an increase of 0.21 (95% CI: 0.07,
0.34) mm per SD increase in birth weight. These
associations were adjusted for age, gender, weight and
length. The analyses focused on left cardiac structure at
the age of 6 months are currently undertaken and will be
presented at the congress.
Conclusions: Fetal growth retardation in second half of
pregnancy is associated with persistent smaller left
ventricular mass and aortic root diameter in early
infancy. Follow-up studies are needed to examine if
these cardiac changes will persist throughout childhood.

Background and Aims: Our previous studies have
indicated that an increase in oxidative stress is involved
in the development of pulmonary hypertension in a lamb
model of increased pulmonary blood flow (Shunts).
However, it is not clear whether this is due, at least in
part, to alterations in lung antioxidant enzymes. Thus,
the goal of this study was to determine whether the
expression and activity of lung antioxidant enzymes are
altered during the development of pulmonary
hypertension in Shunt lambs.
Methods: Eighteen fetal lambs underwent in utero
placement of an aortopulmonary vascular graft. Two-,
four, and eight- weeks following spontaneous delivery,
peripheral lung tissue was collected. Expression of
catalase, SODI and SOD2 were evaluated by Western
blotting. Catalase and SOD activities were also
determined. A P <0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results: Catalase expression and activity were
significantly decreased in 2-week Shunt compared to
Controls but this decrease was not maintained at 4- and
8-weeks. No change in SOD1 expression were observed
in Shunts compared to Controls at any age group but
SOD2 expression was found to be decreased at 2-weeks
of age in Shunts. However, no change in total SOD
activity was observed between Shunt and Controls at
any age group
Conclusions: Lung antioxidant enzyme expression and
activites are altered in lambs with increased pulmonary
blood flow and these differences may play a role in the
development of pulmonary hypertension.

Background and Aims: Strain and strain-rate (SR)
measurements from tissue velocity images (TVI) are
noisy. A novel method for noise estimation, based on
the measured variation between two consecutive heart
beats, was used for assessing the optimal settings during
TVI recording and deformation analysis in term
neonates.
Methods: The strain and SR beat to beat variation
(BBV) were assessed in 8 good-quality TVI for each of
the following probe and frame rate (FR) settings (Vivid
7, GE Vingmed, range +/- 16 cm/sec); 5S probe default
FR, 10S default FR and 10S low FR. Two segments per
wall were analysed using 48 different combinations of
region of interest (ROI) size and strain length (SL).
Results: Both BBVs were lower in the 5S than in both
the 10S series (p<0.05). Both BBVs decreased with
increased SL in each series (p<0.05). Except for the 10S
default FR strain BBV (p=0.086) both BBVs decreased
with increased ROI length (p<0.05). Of the combination
of ROI length and SL eligible for two-segment analyses,
the lowest BBVs in all series were found using ROI
length 1 mm and SL 10mm. The optimal ROI width was
smaller using the 10S probe (1mm) than the 5S probe
(3mm).
Conclusions: The BBVs can be used to assess the
optimal settings during TVI recording and analysis. The
BBVs were lower using the 5S probe than the 10S
probe. In two-segment analysis, the optimal ROI length
was 1mm and SL was 10mm, and the optimal ROI
width was 1mm using the 10S probe and 3mm using the
5S probe.

Background and Aims: After the UK neonatal ECMO
trial (1993-1995), a national ECMO service was
established (1996). ELSO reports worldwide decline in
neonatal ECMO. This paper reviews neonatal
respiratory ECMO in the UK focusing on last 10 years.
Methods: Retrospective review: patient demographics;
illness severity; ECMO indication, characteristics and
outcome.
Results: 804 neonates were supported between 1989-
2005. Cases/year and diagnoses are shown in the graph.
Pre-ECMO treatment changed (1993-2005): iNO 0% to
92%; HFOV 0% to 61% and surfactant from 5 to 63%.
No change occurred in the patient age, length of
ventilation and oxygenation index pre-ECMO. The use
of V-V ECMO increased from 40% (1995) to 69%
(2005). Overall survival to discharge was 79%; MAS
96%, PPHN 84%, HMD 90%, sepsis 60%, CDH 55%
and others 24%.
Conclusions: Overall and diagnosis specific survival is
comparable in the UK to worldwide. More babies are
supported for MAS and less with CDH in the UK
compared with ELSO. It is unclear why, despite having
a centralized national ECMO service, the frequency of
neonatal ECMO has not consistently fallen in the UK.

CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS IN NEONATAL
EXTRACORPOREAL MEMBRAN
OXYGENATION (ECMO) - NEW RESULTS

H Wirth, V Varnholt, T H Schaible
NICU, University Childrens Hospital, Mannheim,
Germany
Background and Aims: ECMO is a standard treatment
in the algorithm of neonatal respiratory failure who can
provide oxygenation and may reduce ventilator induced
injury. Furthermore ECMO helps to avoid high doses of
inotropic medications and may help to overcome
pulmonary hypertension. Over the last 20 years marked
changes have occurred by new technical developments
and indications for neonatal ECMO therapy. We
analysed the changes in our ECMO center over this time
period.
Methods: From 1987-2006, 281 neonates were treated
with ECMO in Mannheim. From 1987-1991, 33
patients, from 1992-1996, 68 and from 1997-2001, 85
patients were treated with ECMO. In the last period
from 2002-2006, 95 patients put on either VV or VA-
ECMO.
Results: The over all survival of this 281 neonates were
72,2% (mean; Period 1-4: 60%/64%/76%/77%). The
mean maximum ventilation pressure was 36,1 mbar
(45,4/42,6/35,6/30,4) the average ECMO time was 167h
(83h/109h/162h/223h). The Oxygenation Index (OI)
was calculated of 51,9 before ECMO
(69,5/58,2/62,5/36,0), NO was used in 31%
(0%/25%/38%/41%) and HFOV by 22% of the patients
(84%/28%/9%76%). The indication for ECMO was in
22% MAS (12%/32%/31%/12%) in 50% CDH
(27%/27%/47%778%) and in 28% others
(61%/41%/22%/10%).
Conclusions: The survival after ECMO was increased
in this period. ECMO was started with lower values of
positive inspiratory peak pressures, and therefore lower
oxygenation index. The time under ECMO was longer.
The spectrum has totally changed to the main patient
group of CDH. Although advances in mechanical
ventilation have been made the necessity for ECMO
remains a tool to override several neonatal lung failure.
BRONCHIOLITIS IN EUROPE – A
COMPARATIVE SURVEY
A Seiz
Department of Pediatric Emergency, University
Hospital, Saint Etienne, France
Background and Aims: Bronchiolitis is a common
cause of illness and an increasingly important cause of
hospitalisation. It remains a major concern for
paediatricians and typically affects infants younger than
two years, principally during winter months.
Bronchiolitis is a self-limited illness in most previously
healthy infants and resolves frequently without
complications. However, severely affected infants are at
increased risk for complications. Assessment of disease
severity is very important in the management of
bronchiolitis. Neither for assessment of severity nor for
hospitalisation nor for treatment recommendations are
official criteria in place. Although there is a lack of well
established criteria a number of guidelines have been
published.
Methods: In this comparative survey appropriate
guidelines were taken from the European French and
German speaking paediatric scholarly societies (Austria,
Belgium, France, Germany, and Switzerland). These
guidelines were evaluated to address the issue of
consistency with evidence from large randomised trials,
meta-analyses, and systematic reviews.
Results: In case of bronchiolitis we have consistent
rates in Europe concerning mortality, morbidity, days of
hospitalisation, need of intensive care, and duration of
mechanical ventilation. Despite of this fact clinical
practice and therapeutically recommendations varies
widely. There are remarkable differences in indications
for hospitalisation and treatment proposals.
Conclusions: In the aggregate, evidence from large
randomised trials, meta-analyses, and systematic
reviews should become generally accepted. They should
enter standardised the official recommendations of
paediatric scholarly societies in Europe. This could
render epidemiological research in this field easier
which promotes the comparability and quality rating at
those points where an agreement is not yet achieved.

Background and Aims: Between 2001-2004, 70,301
healthy infants 6-12 weeks old were enrolled from 11
countries in the Rotavirus Efficacy and Safety Trial
(REST) to receive 3 oral doses of PRV expressing
human serotypes G1-4 and P[8] or placebo. Active
surveillance for hospitalizations and ED visits for AGE
was conducted 7, 14, and 42 days after each dose and
every 6 weeks thereafter for up to two years. Three
doses of PRV reduced the rate of G1-4 RV-associated
hospitalizations/ED visits by 94.5% [95% CI: 91.2,
- 19 -
96.6] (N Engl J Med 2006; 354:23-33). We assessed the
rate reductions in all subjects receiving 1 dose.
Methods: The case definition for RV AGE was
vomiting and/or 3 loose stools within 24 hours and RV
detection in stool by EIA. Serotypes were identified by
PCR. Analyses were performed using Poisson
regression.
Results: Mean length of follow-up after the first dose
was 314.5 days in PRV recipients and 314.4 days in
placebo recipients. Rate reduction for
hospitalizations/ED visits due to G1-4 RV AGE
occurring after the first dose was 91.9% [95% CI: 88.0,
94.5] in PRV recipients. Rate reductions for the 5 most
commonly observed serotypes are shown in the table.
Conclusions: PRV consistently decreased
hospitalizations/ED visits for RV AGE caused by each
of the 5 most common serotypes observed in the large
international REST.

Background and Aims: Paediatric Rotavirus
Gastroenteritis (PRG) affects the majority of children
during the first years of life and causes a considerable
medical and economic burden of disease (BOD). In
order to quantify this BOD and the beneficial impact of
preventative vaccination, further understanding of
seasonal and age distribution of PRG is required.
Methods: A prospective, observational, study was
conducted in seven coutries (Belgium, France,
Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom).
Children up to 5 years of age with physician-diagnosed
acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were included. They were
recruited from 12 hospitals, 16 emergency departments
and 139 paediatricians (FP/GP) between Oct 2004 and
Sept 2005. Rotavirus was determined by ELISA testing.
Results: Among 2846 children with AGE, 1102 had
PRG. For the percentage of PRG among AGE see
table1. More than 94% of those presenting with PRG
were aged >=6 months. The temporal distribution of
PRG varied between the winter and summer months,
with a peak between January and March (57% to 64% of
all AGE cases).
Conclusions: More than 94% of PRG presented after
the age of 6 months with the highest proportion of PRG
seen in hospitals. During the winter months, the
majority of AGE cases are due to PRG. Vaccination of
infants against rotavirus infection should significantly
reduce the annual and winter burden of AGE during
early childhood.

Background and Aims: Human Metapneumovirus
(hMPV) is a worldwide distributed pathogen in pediatric
viral respiratory tract infection (VRTI). Earlier
publications suggest milder illness severity in hMPV-
compared to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)-
infection.
Methods: 637 nasopharyngeal aspirates from pediatric
patients were tested by hMPV-PCR in two consecutive
seasons. Risk factors, clinical, and laboratory items were
analyzed. The hMPV-infected patients were compared
with hMPV-negative, RSV-infected patients by matched
pair analysis.
Results: hMPV was detected in 17.9% of all NPA. In
total, 88 hMPV-infected patients with complete dataset
were considered. More than one half of all hMPV
patients were older than 12 months. 45.5% had at least
one risk factor for severe courses of the VRTI; 27.3%
were prematurely born infants, 15.9% with a birth
weight <1500g. Among hMPV-infected patients 39
(44.3%) were coinfected with other respiratory viruses
(RSV in 29.5%). Coinfection did not result in higher
illness severity. On matched pair analysis
(hMPV+/RSV- vs. hMPV-/RSV+) the epidemiological
and clinical features of hMPV-infection were similar to
those of RSV infection although somewhat higher
proportions of patients with hypoxemia on admission
(33 vs. 21%) and of intensive care treatment (20.8 vs.
10.4%) were observed in the hMPV group than in the
RSV group. The hMPV patients more often showed
lobar infiltrates in radiologically chest examination. In
60% of all hMPV-infections, the attending physicians
prescribed antimicrobial chemotherapy.
- 20 -
Conclusions: The earlier assumption that hMPV
infections are milder than RSV infections does not apply
in hospitalized patients (Wilkesmann et al., Eur. J. Ped.,
in press). The first two authors contributed equally to
this work.

Background and Aims: Tetanus is a neurological
disorder with spasticity, muscle spasms and autonomic
disturbances caused by neurotoxin 'tetanospasmin'
produced by clostridium tetani. Tetanus was first
described in Egypt over 3000 years ago and was
prevalent throughout the ancient world. Very few
reviews of tetanus in children are available in India and
other countries. Our aim was to study the mode of
infection, incubation period, period of onset, duration of
spasms, complications, vaccination status and outcome.
Methods: Diagnosis of tetanus was made on clinical
grounds. Cases of tetanus between 1 month and 16 years
of age admitted between August 1999 to December
2002 were evaluated retrospectively. Severity was
graded on the basis of Patel and Joag criteria.
Results: Overall incidence was 1.09%. Out of 40 cases
(M:F=1:1), 27 were discharged, 9 were deaths and 4 had
DAMA (Discharge Against Medical Advise). Traumatic
tetanus (42.5%) was more common than otogenic
(37.5%). The mortality was seen among severe cases
(9 of 10). Severe attack and poor prognosis has been
associated with short incubation period and period of
onset. Thrombophlebitis is the most common
complication encountered followed by lower respiratory
tract infection. Autonomic imbalances continue to be
difficult to treat and associated with high mortality.
Conclusions: Post neonatal tetanus continues to be a
major cause of mortality and morbidity among rural
population in India. An incomplete or poor
immunization status in combination with CSOM and a
high chance of injury to the feet and subsequent
contamination with tetanus bacilli puts the rural poor at
a high risk.

Background and Aims: RSV is the leading cause of
hospitalisation of infants and is an important pathogen
of the elderly and the immunosuppressed. Existing
preventions and treatments are limited. RNAi utilizes
existing ubiquitous cellular proteins to catalyze targeted
mRNA degradation in a sequence-specific manner.
Aims: To evaluate small inhibiting RNAs (siRNA) as
potential antivirals and to test their safety in humans.
Methods: The RSV genome was screened
bioinformatically for consensus sequences across RSV
strains while avoiding human homology by BLAST.
Resulting siRNAs were screened invitro by plaque
reduction. Promising candidates targeting RSV P, N and
L mRNA were screened invivo using BALB/c mouse
models utilizing mismatched siRNA controls. ALN-
RSV01 (N target) was further evaluated by formal
toxicology studies. Single and multiple rising doses of
ALN-RSV01 nasal spray were evaluated in healthy
adults in a double-blind, placebo-(saline)-controlled
phase 1 trial.
Results: Given 4hr before or 24hr after infection, a
single dose (2 mg/kg) of selected P, N or L targeted
siRNAs reduced lung virus by 4 or 3 log pfu/g
respectively and prevented disease (weight loss).
Mismatch siRNA controls showed no viral reduction.
No toxicity was observed in rats and monkeys exposed
IV or to 4 doses via intranasal aspiration (NOEL
>48mg/kg in rats; >24 mg/kg in monkeys). 65 adults
receiving 1.5-150mg of ALN-RSV01 exhibited similar
rates and types of adverse events (AEs) as did placebo
recipients. All AEs were mild.
Conclusions: RNAi may offer a new strategy for RSV
treatment. ALN-RSV01 appears safe and well tolerated
when given intranasally and should undergo further
clinical evaluation. (funding: Alnylam Pharmaceuticals).
EFFECTS OF INITIATION OF CONTINUOUS
RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY ON
HAEMODYNAMICS IN CRITICALLY ILL
CHILDREN
J Brierley, M Richardson, M Peters
Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street
Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: There are no studies analysing
the haemodynamic effects of initiating continuous
venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH) in critically ill
children. Haemodynamic instability is often met by
countering ‘filter-related decreased systemic vascular
resistance (SVR)’ with vasoconstrictors. Newer non-
invasive haemodynamic techniques may allow more
physiological management.
Methods: Prospective observational study of 9 critically
ill children (1-9 years) to define haemodynamic
responses to commencing CVVH. Heart rate (HR),
mean blood pressure (MABP), central venous pressure
(CVP), and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2%)
were directly measured at 15 minutely intervals for an
hour together with cardiac index (CI), SVR index
(SVRi), stroke volume index (SVi) by non-invasive
continuous wave Doppler ultrasound device. (USCOM)
No changes in inotrope or volume administration
occurred during the study. Results: CVVH induced an
- 21 -
initial significant decrease in the volume-related
haemodynamic parameters SVi and CVP. Subsequently
a significant increase in SVRi and decrease in CI were
seen. ScvO2 remained unchanged.
Conclusions: Initiating CVVH in critically ill children
induces hypovolemia leading too a systemic
cardiovascular response of vasoconstriction and overall
decrease in cardiac output. This may represent
haemodilution with lowering of effective inotropic
concentration through increased volume of distribution,
or there may be a direct negative inotropic effect of
initiating CVVH. Physiological based therapy would
consist of increasing inotropes, rather than
vasoconstrictors.

Department of Pediatrics, Amphia
Hospital, Breda, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Dehydration due to
gastroenteritis is a serious health problem in younger
children and accounts for a substantial number of
admissions at paediatric wards. Despite recent
guidelines part of these children are rehydrated with
intravenous fluids and hospitalisation stay is prolonged.
Our objective is to evaluate whether rehydration with
oral rehydration solution during a four-hour period in
the hospital is safe and efficient in children with acute
gastroenteritis. Primary outcome is the success rate, that
is the percentage of children who are successfully
rehydrated and sent home after rehydration. Secondary
outcomes are duration of diarrhea and/or vomiting and
reassessment at the emergency department or
requirement of hospitalisation.
Methods: A total of 102 patients (6 months - 6 years)
admitted with dehydration due to acute gastroenteritis
were enrolled in our study. Exclusion criteria included
invagination, ileus, short bowel syndrome, volvulus,
diabetes mellitus, HUS and underlying severe parenteral
infection. Depending on the severity of dehydration,
patients were rehydrated according to ESPGHAN
guidelines with 50 to 100 ml/kg ORS over four hours,
followed by continuation of the usual diet.
Results: 97 Patients were rehydrated following our
study design. In 80,4% this was successful and in 19,6%
the hospitalisation had to be prolonged. Biochemical
laboratory results and stool cultures were not predictors
of failure and had no extra value in the management.
Conclusions: Our results provide support for successful
rehydration in four hours with ORS® and for reduction
in the need of intravenous therapy and hospitalisation.
After correcting dehydration, early refeeding warrants
lasting hydration.

Medicine, University of Tromsø, Tromsø, Norway
Background and Aims: Emotional and behavioral
problems and reduced social and academic competence
are common in VLBW survivors. Studies often
conclude from parent-report (CBCL) alone. Youth self-
report (YSR) is uncommon.
Methods: Of 265 VLBW preterms born 1978 – 1989,
174 survived to adolescence (65.7%). Those 13 to 18
years were addressed. 156 families were eligible, 99
completed CBCL (63.5%), and 82 completed YSR
(52.6%). CBCL and YSR provide problem and
competence scores. Parents of VLBW adolescents were
compared to parents of normative adolescents, VLBW
adolescents were compared to normative adolescents,
VLBW adolescents and their parents were compared in
pairs. T-tests and Intraclass correlation were used.
Results: Parents of VLBW adolescents reported more
(p<0.01) total, social and attention problems, and less
total and school competence in males, and more
internalizing, social and attention problems, and less
total and school competence in females. VLBW
adolescents males reported less (p<0.01) total,
internalizing, externalizing, and attention problems, and
VLBW adolescents females reported less total,
externalizing, social, and attention problems, compared
to controls. Both gender reported significantly higher
activity competence than controls. Female adolescents,
in contrast to males, reported significant higher problem
scores compared to their parents. Moderate to high
correlations were found, except for externalizing
behavior in females.
Conclusions: According to parents significant
proportions of VLBW adolescents experience more
behavioral problems, and less competence than
normative adolescents. According to VLBW adolescents
they experience less behavioral problems and equal or
higher competence than normative controls. Female
VLBW adolescents have behavioral problems, in
particular externalizing problems, unrecognized by
parents.

Background and Aims: Dexamethasone improves
ventilatory status in BPD, but has a negative impact on
long-term neurodevelopment. Another corticosteroid
with fewer side effects would be welcomed:
hydrocortisone may offer such alternative. We
investigated neurodevelopment and presence of brain
lesions at school age in preterm infants, who had been
prescribed hydrocortisone for BPD.
Methods: 226 preterm born children ( 32 weeks or
birth weight 1500 grams) participated in a cohort study
with 8 years follow-up. They performed five subtests of
the WISC-R, the Visual Motor Integration (VMI) and a
memory test. Motor function was assessed using the
Movement ABC. Brain lesions were documented by
MRI. Sixty-two children who received hydrocortisone
for BPD (5 mg/kg tapered over a minimum period of 22
days, median duration 27.5 days) were compared with
164 controls.
Results: Hydrocortisone-treated infants were younger,
lighter and sicker than their non-steroid counterparts. To
deal with group differences, adjustment for gestational
age, birth weight, gender, need for mechanical
ventilation and small-for-gestational-age was performed.
Adjusted mean IQ, VMI and memory results were the
same in the hydrocortisone and the non-steroid group
(99 vs 101, p:0.62; 97 vs 99, p:0.49, 7.9 vs 7.5, p:0.42
respectively). The incidence of CP in both groups was
equal (11% vs 7%, p:0.97. The Total Impairment Score
in non-CP children was 5.5 in both groups. Occurrence
of brain lesions on MRI and mean midsagittal corpus
callosum area were the same.
Conclusions: Hydrocortisone in the mentioned dose,
administered in the neonatal period for BPD, does not
appear to have long-term effects on neurodevelopment.

Background and Aims: Young adults born very
preterm or with a very-low-birth-weight remain at risk
for physical and neurodevelopmental problems and
lower academic achievement scores. Data however are
scarce, hospital-based, mostly done in small populations
and need further confirmation.
Methods: Infants born below 32 weeks of gestation
and/or with a birth weight less than 1,500 gram in the
Netherlands in 1983 (POPS study), were re-examined at
age 19. Outcomes were adjusted for nonrespondents
using multiple imputation and categorized into none,
mild, moderate and severe problems.
Results: Of 959 surviving young adults, 705 (74%)
were assessed and/or completed the questionnaires.
Moderate or severe problems were present in 4.3% for
cognition, 1.8% for hearing, 1.9% for vision, and 8.1%
for neuromotor functioning. Using the Health Utility
Index and the London Handicap Scale, we found 2.0%
and 4.5%, respectively, of the young adults to have three
or more affected areas in activities and participation.
Special education or lesser level was completed by 24%,
and 7.6% neither had a paid job nor did they follow any
education. Overall, 31.7% suffered from one or more
moderate or severe problems in the assessed areas.
Conclusions: 12.6% young adults born very preterm
and/or with a very-low-birth-weight had moderate or
severe problems in cognitive or neurosensory
functioning. Nearly all young adults were satisfied with
their activities and participation in society. Compared
with the general Dutch population twice as many young
adults born very preterm and/or with a very-low-birth-
weight were poorly educated and three times as many
were neither employed nor in school at age 19.

Background and Aims: Motor problems have been
frequently reported in low birth weight populations, and
may be related to visual, perceptive or proprioceptive
deficits. The aim of this study was to examine the
association between motor skills and vision, perception
and proprioception in adolescents with low birth weight
without cerebral palsy (CP).
Methods: Fifty-one very low birth weight adolescents
(VLBW: birth weight 1500g), 57 term small for
gestational age (SGA: birth weight <10th centile) and 77
term control adolescents (birth weight 10th centile)
without CP were examined by the age of 14. We
performed regression analyses with the total score of the
Movement Assessement Battery for Children
(Movement ABC) as the outcome variable and the
Visuo-Motor Integration test (VMI), the Motor
Coordination and Visual Perception supplementary
tasks, tests of proprioceptive abilities, visual acuity,
contrast sensitivity, strabismus and stereopsis as
independent variables.
Results: Backward stepwise regression suggested that
motor problems in the VLBW group were significantly
explained by poor contrast sensitivity, poor stereopsis
and a low score on the Motor Coordination task. In the
SGA group motor problems were explained by a low
score on the Visual Perception task, whereas poor
proprioception was associated with motor problems in
the control group.
Conclusions: The results suggest that visual deficits are
important factors in explaining motor problems in
VLBW and SGA adolescents, whereas visual functions
in adolescents with normal birth weight do not seem to
limit their motor skills.

Background and Aims: Perinatal information was
obtained on all but two infants with gestational age
(GA) <28 weeks born in Norway in 1999-2000.
Sensorimotor outcome was assessed at 2 years.
Methods: All pediatric departments in Norway
participated. The children had a neurodevelopmental
examination, and predefined outcome data were
registered.
Results: 364 of 464 neonates (79%) were resuscitated,
290 (80%) were discharged. Two died later and 2 were
not traced, leaving 286 (99%) for follow-up. 34 (12%)
had sensorimotor handicaps. 3 of 4 blind had grade 5 or
6 ROP before discharge. 15 of 26 with CP (58%) had
major ultrasound (CUS) pathology as neonates while 11
had normal CUS or grade 1-2 hemorrhage. 19 of 34 with
major CUS findings had no CP or hydrocephalus.
Conclusions: Survival and intact survival decreased
with decreasing GA. For the survivors the handicap rate
increased with decreasing GA except for a low rate at 23
weeks, probably because of a low threshold for stopping
treatment. CUS had only modest predictive value.

Background and Aims: ELBW infants frequently
receive red blood cell transfusions. We previously
conducted a multicentre trial (PINT) to compare rates of
death or major morbidity at hospital discharge of
transfusion at low vs high hemoglobin transfusion
thresholds (PAS 2004: 55, LB15); we showed no
significant differences in outcomes. In our present study
we determined whether or not there were later
differences in death or neurodevelopmental outcome at
eighteen months corrected age.
Methods: ELBW infants <48 hrs of age were
randomized to an algorithm of low or high transfusion
thresholds, max Hgb 135 g/l, min 75 g/l, differing by
10-20 g/L depending on age and respiratory support, and
maintained until discharge. Infants were followed up for
death or neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months
corrected age.
Results: We randomized 451 infants from 10 NICUs.
The groups were well matched for prognostic factors
and baseline hemoglobin level. Median (IQR) birth-
weight was 769 (670-887) g and gestational age 26 (25-
27) weeks. Groups differed in mean hemoglobin level
by approximately 10 g/l from weeks one through twelve.
317 of 338 survivors were available for follow up. There
were no significant differences in primary (table) or in
growth or secondary developmental outcomes.
- 24 -
Conclusions: Maintaining the hemoglobin of ELBW
infants at low rather than high levels with this algorithm
does not result in significant differences in survival or
neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months corrected
age.
CLINICAL PREDICTORS OF OUTCOME IN A

CONTROLLED TRIAL OF WHOLE BODY
HYPOTHERMIA FOR NEONATAL HYPOXIC-

Network, Bethesda, MD, USA
Background and Aims: Whole body hypothermia
reduced the frequency of death or moderate/severe
disabilities in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy (HIE). N Engl J Med 2005:353:1574-
84. Predictors of outcome of whole body cooling have
not been reported to date. To evaluate a) associations
between variables at <6 hours of age with outcome at 18
months.
Methods: Variables examined included pre- and peri-
natal and neonatal variables. Odds ratios and 99%
confidence intervals (OR, 99%CI) were calculated.
Results: The primary outcome was associated with time
to spontaneous respiration >10 min 5.6 (1.4 - 23.2), cord
pH per 0.1 decrease 1.6 (1.1-2.1), base deficit per 1.0
increase 1.1 (1.0-1.3), and severe alteration in either
level of consciousness 4.7 (1.4 - 15.7), spontaneous
activity 5.5 (1.6 -18.7), primitive reflexes 4.1 (1.2 -14.1)
or autonomic system 4.4 (1.2 - 16.2). Among control
group infants, low Apgar scores at 5 mins 4.8 (1.2 –
19.8) and 10 mins 6.1 (1.6 - 23.1), >10 mins to
spontaneous respiration 10.1 (2.6 - 38.8) and severe
alteration in level of consciousness 8.9 (2.2 - 36.6),
spontaneous activity 6.0 (1.6 - 22.8) or primitive
reflexes 6.6 (1.9 - 22.6) were correlated to outcome.
Perinatal variables, seizures, out-born birth and time to
cooling did not impact outcome.
Conclusions: Predictors of outcome for infants
undergoing whole body hypothermia for neonatal HIE
include increasing neonatal acidosis, prolonged time to
spontaneous respiration, and components of the
neurological exam demonstrating encephalopathy.
Maternal variables were not predictive. These findings
will assist in planning future trials of hypothermia for
HIE.

Mère Enfant, CHU de Nantes, France
Background and Aims: Premature birth is stressful and
associated with more long-term stress. To determine, 7
years after discharge, the maternal psychological
consequences of an hospitalisation of a premature infant
less than 32 GA.
Methods: 66 mothers (mean age 30 years)
corresponding to 82 infants (mean gestational age 30 +/-
2.5 weeks, mean birth weight 1435 +/- 417 grams) from
the EPIPAGE cohort in Pays de Loire were eligible and
answered a phone semi structured interview 7 years
after discharge (mean neonatal hospitalisation stay 55
+/- 28 days). We analysed all answer taking neonatal
characteristics and 5 years follow-up of infant into
account.
Results: Remember of neonatal stress remain painful 7
years after discharge. Young maternal age, caesarean
section, maternal hospitalisation in USI, and neonatal
death of a twin are associated with a difficult emotional
feeling. Strictly medical information as CRIB score (p =
0.001) and ultrasound neurological abnormalities (p =
0.003) are significantly associated with an increase
psychological stress. Emotional reactivation of this
stress is still observed 7 years after discharge whatever
the presence or not of poor 5 years-outcome. Maternal
satisfaction of care givers is better for high risk infants
than infants of birth weight > 1500 g (p = 0.041).
Conclusions: There is practical implications to support
parents precociously during hospitalisation and to
continue the long-term psychological follow-up. It
remains most important for care givers to enhance the
quality of medical information even in low risk
situation.
MORAL DILEMMAS IN ETHICAL DECISION
MAKING FOR NURSES: ROLES AND MODELS
J E De Vos, A Van Den Hoogen
Department of Neonatology, WKZ, UMC Utrecht, The
Netherlands
Background and Aims: Nurses roles in ethical decision
making and how nurses are defining an opinion in moral
dilemmas is an issue in neonatology and pediatrics.
Moral dilemmas arise in discussions on whether or not
to start or to continue a treatment for infants in an
intensive care unit.
Methods: Two qualitative studies were done. The
results were analysed by the method of Maso (1994).
Data generation took place by means of semi-structured
interviews with nurses working in the NICU of the
Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis (University Medical
Centre in Utrecht) and by literature study. The moral
model used was the so called 'Model of Nijmegen' for
moral reasoning. The theories on justice and care
perspective of Kohlberg, 1984 and Gilligan, 1985 make
up the study's theoretical framework.
Results: Nurses mainly act as representatives for the
children. They are supporting, assisting and caring. In
their moral reasoning nurses especially focus attention
on the child. In their considerations the following
aspects play a role: the present situation, the future
- 25 -
situation, and the child's environment (parents). The
study's further explores and explains the aspect 'the
child's pain and suffering' and 'looking at the child' as a
part of the specific know-how of nurses.
Conclusions: Nurses need to emphasize more on their
own role and strenghten that role. Integration and
participation of nurses in moral discussions is therefore
open to improvement. The possibility to discuss
emotional aspects is warranted.
PARENTAL PRESENCE DURING
RESUSCITATION
J M Latour
PICU, Erasmus MC - Sophia Children's Hospital,
Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: The current resuscitation
guidelines are supportive to parental presence during
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). However, the
subject remains a controversial issue. The aim is to
determine the pros and cons of the healthcare
professionals’ view of witnessed CPR, to discuss the
parental empowerment and the impact on parents, and to
assess the implication of the current CPR guidelines
regarding parental presence during resuscitation.
Methods: A literature search on parental presence
during CPR was performed. Particular on the issues of
the professionals’ views and attitudes, the impact on
family and parents and the available position statements
of organisations.
Results: Social and cultural differences are diverse and
may influence the parents’ view on witnessed CPR.
However, there is a trend that parents do not like to
leave their child. Those parents who have witnessed
CPR, would wish to stay again. Parental presence during
resuscitation seems to have no long-term adverse
effects. Among professionals, controversies remain on
this subject. Arguments against parental presence range
from traumatic experience of parents to disturbance of
professional performance. However, there is a tendency
to give parents the choice to stay. Most articles conclude
with the words ‘allow, support, encourage, give the
opportunity’ to present the view on parental witnessed
resuscitation. Guidelines are therefore necessary to state
the departments’ vision and practice. An increasing
tendency is observed towards the development of
official position statements. Supposing that the current
data to support parental presence during CPR is
insufficient, the latest CPR guidelines provide a positive
advice towards parental presence.
Conclusions: Although still controversial in many
countries, there is a strong and supportive trend towards
parental presence during resuscitation. More evidence
becomes available on attitudes and the effects on parents
and staff. It is recommended to create guidelines on the
principles of parental presence during resuscitation.
HONESTY WITH MERCY
D E Knight
Evelina Children's Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: Honesty can be considered to
exist along a continuum ranging from dishonesty to
honesty. Every person has their own individual place on
this continuum, dictated by their individual backgrounds
and experiences. It is hoped to encourage bedside
intensive-care nurses to identify where they are on this
continuum and to actively participate in helping render
patients and their families more “ready” for receiving
and coping with bad news.
Methods: The dishonesty/honesty continuum is
identified. With examples from the author’s own
nursing experiences, her movement along this
continuum is illustrated giving rise to her current belief
in honesty with mercy in nurse relationships with
patients and their families. This illustration focuses on
three aspects of honesty: truth-telling, timing and lying.
Also, it highlights the unique position intensive-care
nurses have at the bedside. They often have unique
knowledge of the patients’ and families’ wishes to know
information and the amounts that will be manageable by
them. Similarly, often they can create, or be presented
with, unique opportunities to help vulnerable patients
and their families become receptive to disclosure of
information.
Results: Ideally, practitioners present will: a) reflect on,
and justify, where they are on the dishonesty/honesty
continuum; and b) identify ways they can enhance their
use of their unique positions in helping patients and
families receive bad news.
Conclusions: Bedside nurses can help render patients
and their families more “ready” for bad news and should
actively take on responsibility for this.
CHALLENGING THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF
THE PHILOSOPHY OF 'PARTNERSHIP WITH
PARENTS'
I Coyne, J A Conlon
School of Nursing, Dublin City University, Ireland
Background and Aims: Parent participation is a key
issue in children's health care, both in Ireland and
internationally. Although nurses are expected to enter
into partnership with families in the provision of care,
research on parental participation from the UK, Sweden,
Australia and from the USA indicates that parental
participation is a complex, multidimensional and
problematic concept that nurses find difficult to
understand and apply to practice. This research focuses
on developing an understanding of parents and childrens
experiences of consultation and involvement in care
during periods of hospitalization.
Methods: Previous research in this area has been
descriptive therefore a grounded theory approach was
used to develop a theoretical perspective on parent
participation in order to explain the underlying process.
The data collected contributed to the theoretical
framework which Dr. Imelda Coyne developed in her
PhD, which enhanced the applicability and
generalisability of the theory across many paediatric
settings.
Results: Results indicate that there is a concerning lack
of understanding about the parents role during a childs
hospital admission. Over reliance on parents to
- 26 -
participate, a lack of clarity of the concept 'Partnership'
and factors outside the nurses control are also causing
undue distress.
Conclusions: Parents involvement should be voluntary
and not necessary. A number of factors need to be
addressed in order to ensure this, namely
documentation, staffing levels and a greater
understanding of the concepts particiaption and
partnership.
INVESTIGATION OF CHILDREN'S
EXPERIENCES OF INVOLVEMENT AND
CONSULTATION IN THEIR HEALTH CARE
WITHIN THE HOSPITAL SETTING IN IRELAND
I T Coyne, E Hayes, P Gallagher
School of Nursing, Dublin City University, Ireland
Background and Aims: The past decade has seen the
importance of children’s rights to participation and
consultation established both nationally and
internationally. Yet the evidence suggests that children’s
participation may be more rhetoric than reality. There is
limited empirical data on hospitalised children’s
participation in consultations and decision-making in
Ireland. Hence this paper reports on children’s
experiences of involvement and consultation in their
health care in hospital. Ensuring that the views of
children are taken into account in matters affecting them
is consistent with the vision of the Irish National
Children’s Strategy, which is “an Ireland where children
are respected as young citizens with a valued
contribution to make, and a voice of their own” (2000,
p4). Aims: (a) To describe children’s experiences of
consultation in the healthcare setting. (b) To identify the
factors that enhance or hinder children’s involvement in
consultation and the decision making process. (c) To
explore strategies that will facilitate children’s
participation in their own health care decisions.
Methods: The data were collected through focus
groups, single interviews, and questionnaires. Data were
obtained from children (n = 55) aged from 7 to 18 years
from ten paediatric wards in three hospitals in Ireland.
Results: The findings revealed that the children wanted
to participate in consultations and decisions about their
care, but had varying experiences of involvement. The
children generally experienced problems in having their
voices heard and appeared to occupy a marginalised
position in healthcare interactions.
Conclusions: The findings will be presented and
reviewed in light of existing theoretical frameworks and
published research.
DILEMMA, AN ORGANISATION SUPPORTING
PARENTS OF SERIOUSLY ILL OR
HANDICAPPED CHILDREN DURING THE
PROCESS OF DECISION MAKING

Dilemma Foundation, Utrecht, The Netherlands

Department of Neonatology, Máxima Medical Centre,
Veldhoven, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: End-of-life decisions precede
death in two third of the deaths of children below one
year of age and in an unknown percentage of children
that do not die. Although many of these decisions are
taken in good cooperation between parents and doctors,
both the process of decision making and the decisions
themselves can create an enormous burden for the
parents. During the process of decision making,
caregivers frequently disagree, leaving the parents in
even greater distress. In the Netherlands, termination of
life in newborns with hopeless and unbearable suffering
is considered a criminal offence, even if it takes place on
explicit request of the parents.
Methods: Dilemma is a foundation that supports parents
that have questions about life and death of their
seriously ill or handicapped child, either before or after
birth. Support is provided in the broadest sense, varying
from offering an opportunity to talk, to helping in
finding professionals who can mediate or take over the
existing treatment. Dilemma runs a telephone number,
situated at the desk of the Dutch Paediatric Association.
The foundation’s backbone is a number of volunteers
and a network of independent professional experts.
Results: During the last 10 years some 30 persons
contacted Dilemma each year. Of all questions, 30%
regarded information, 50% counseling and 20%
explicitly requested ending of treatment or ending of
life. The content of the questions regarded medical facts
like prognosis of the disease, risks of operations,
possibilities of other treatments; legal questions like
rights of parents, rights of doctors to continue or end
treatment and the procedure of a law suit. Counseling
was sometimes very practical like helping to arrange a
burial of a very young fetus after abortion or providing
for a second opinion. In all cases the counseling
included the need for conversation, trust and support.
The requests for life ending measures lead to extended
discussions about future perspective of the child, benefit
of treatment, meaning of life and the amount of
suffering a human may endure. In turmoil of feelings,
anxiety, agony, lost of trust, guilt, love and resignation
alternate. Controversies between parents and doctors
have been arisen on continuing or withholding
treatment, parents’ request for purposely ending the life
of their child, insufficient communication, counseling or
support and confusion about the medical treatment.
Conclusions: We conclude that there’s a consistent and
urgent need for consultation and information with
parents who are involved in decisions regarding the
(end-of-life in) sick child. Dilemma provides support in
the broadest sense. In our opinion, the information about
the support that parents seek and the results of our
interventions can be of great value to health care
providers who seek to improve the decision making
process in sick newborns.

PNEUMOCOCCAL CONJUGATE VACCINE:
IMPACT OF PREVENAR IN NORTH AMERICA

THE MANAGEMENT OF FEBRILE CHILDREN
IN THE PNEUMOCOCCAL CONJUGATE
VACCINE ERA
D Isaacman
Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Collegeville, PA, USA
The heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
(Prevenar) has lead to a marked decrease in the
incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease, and
significant changes in the epidemiology of occult
bacteremia. This talk will review the clinical
implications of reductions in invasive pneumococcal
disease as they affect the practicing clinician. Particular
emphasis will be dedicated to the impact of reductions
of pneumococcal bacteremia and meningitis on the
management of fever without source in the child 3-36
months of age.
CHANGES IN THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF
INVASIVE PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE IN
SPAIN
F Gimenez
Servicio de Pediatría, Hospital Torrecardenas, Almería,
Spain
Objective: To describe the global situation of
pneumococcal disease and also the impact of 7-valent
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPn-CRM) in Spain
5y after its commercialization.
Methods: We describe status disease going through all
Spanish data published and accessible. We have to take
into account an important issue: IPD including meningitis
is not a notifiable disease, therefore is difficult to obtain
pre-commercialization data to compare with post-
commercialization data. It is also important to note that
nowadays vaccine coverage is unknown.
Results: In a study conducted in Navarre and Basque
Country, by the second year after 7vPn-CRM
introduction, comparing with pre-vacunal period (1998-
2001) the incidence of IPD decreased by 69.2%, 42.0%
and 39.0% in children <1y, <2y, and <5y respectively.
Focused on Navarre data until 2005 we do not observe
this decrease. The explanation is that the data collection
methodology in Emergency Room Units has substantially
varied, increasing the number of blood cultures
performed, so adjusting IPD rates by blood cultures you
could obtain more reliable data on changes of incidence
(Fig.1).
In Madrid based on the data from hospital discharges
obtained by the Basic Minimal Data Set, a progressive
decrease on the incidence of IPD is detected from 1999
onwards, mainly due to a decrease in pneumococcal
pneumonias. This data along time are among the scarce
data published. The decrease of the incidence affects all
age groups in Madrid, being the most significant decrease
in children <2y and <5y; 30.7% and 28.9% respectively
In the Basque Country and as reported in its
Epidemiology Official Report 2003, the incidence of IPD
considerably decreased in 2002: 73.8% in children <5y.
The currently available data in this Region at the end of
2005, collected in public and private hospitals, indicate
that the reduction in 2005 with respect to 2000 in children
<5y, <2y and <1y are: 55.1%, 65.6%, and 72.8%
respectively.
An increase in incidence and severity of parapneumonic
pleural empyemas has been observed and described in the
international literature for years before the beginning of
the implementation of the 7vPn-CRM. In Spain there are
few data about pneumonia or empyema, according to the
data published it cannot be inferred that bacteremic
pneumococcal pneumonia has increased or that
empyemas are due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. This
situation has been described in countries such as UK,
which has not implemented 7vPn-CRM. There is no study
in the literature that can relate the increase of
pneumococcal pneumonia complicated with empyema
with the implementation of 7vPn-CRM.
Conclusions: A decrease of the incidence of invasive
pneumococcal disease (IPD) has occurred in Spain,
although to a lesser degree than that recorded in countries
such as the USA, which have greater vaccine coverage. In
long-term surveillance studies is necessary adjusting the
results by methodologies changes (blood cultures,
PCR…). The disease burden must continue to be
monitored and analyzed according to the characteristics of
the epidemiological vigilance methods developed in each
Region. The BoH must establish a pneumococcal
surveillance system in Spain to control the pneumococcal
disease at all ages. To conclude, the Health Authorities
should introduce 7vPn-CRM in the National
Immunization Programme in order to be able to control
more effectively severe childhood pneumococcal disease,
as is done in other surrounding countries.

HONORARY LECTURE: THE IMPACT OF
PRENATAL AND POSTNATAL STEROIDS AND
SURFACTANT REPLACEMENT THERAPY ON
THE OUTCOME OF PRE-TERM INFANTS
E Shinwell
Professor of Neonatal Paediatrics, Department of
Neonatology, Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot and
Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel
Background and Aims: Bengt Robertson is a pioneer
of research in lung disease of premature infants. His
work has revolutionized the management and outcome
of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) and
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). In his honor, the
ESPR established this year a Young Investigator’s
Award to stimulate future leaders in the field. This
lecture will trace the development of the major
interventions in the field - surfactant replacement and
pre- and postnatal steroid therapy. The current state of
the art will be reviewed, together with emphasis on the
most recent controversial issues of the day.
Methods: Data will be presented from specific studies,
meta-analyses and systematic review of each of three
issues and their interactions (surfactant, prenatal and
postnatal steroids)
Results: Surfactant therapy significantly reduces the
severity of RDS and its associated mortality. Current
unresolved issues to be discussed include the role of
surfactant therapy in Meconium Aspiration Syndrome
and Adult-type RDS, the use of surfactant at 23-25
weeks of gestation and the definition of the
requirements for an effective synthetic surfactant
preparation based on phospholipids combined with
peptides that simulate the biophysical function of SP-B
and/or SP-C. Antenatal steroid therapy significantly
reduces the incidence of RDS, Intraventricular
Hemorrhage and mortality. Current unresolved issues
that will be discussed include the possibly inadequate
effect of current recommended doses in multiple
pregnancies (Do we need a higher dose?) and
comparison of the effect of different steroid preparations
on White Matter Injury in the premature neonate.
Postnatal steroid therapy significantly reduces the
severity of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia. However,
early postnatal steroid therapy is associated with
increased risk for Cerebral Palsy and
neurodevelopmental delay. Current issues that will be
discussed include the effects of reduced steroid usage at
a population level and the identification of a specific
high-risk group in whom the benefits of therapy may
outweigh the attendant risks.
Conclusions: The prevention and management of
respiratory distress in premature infants has progressed
by leaps and bounds, thanks to pioneering investigators
such as Bengt Robertson and others. However, the
current controversies leave much work for future Young
Investigators.
ALLERGY AND THE GUT
A Nieto
Paediatric Allergy Unit, Childrens Hospital La Fe,
Valencia, Spain
Background and Aims: The gut is the way through
which the greatest number of substances, and the highest
quantities of them come into the body. Many of these
substances have high allergenic properties. At the same
time considerable number of substances that reach the
gut, have enzymatic activity. Thus it is possible that
these substances are able to induce injuries in the
intestinal mucosa, so disrupting the intestinal barrier,
and permitting the pass of allergens into the circulation.
Furthermore, there are many evidences that suggest that
Allergy is a systemic disease, with a local expression.
Thus, and considering the allergic child as a whole, it is
convenient to consider the gut, not as a isolated entity,
but more properly as an organ interconnected with
others which constitute the integral Mucosal Immune
System (MIS). The interactions between different
organs involved in the MIS are critical in the
development of localized symptoms. In consequence,
from an allergologic point of view, the gut should be
observed: A) As a barrier element, that blocks the pass
to the systemic circulation of substances able to develop
systemic or remote localized allergic symptoms. B) As a
crucial element for the development of immunologic
tolerance during the first days/weeks of life. C) As a
direct target organ for digestive allergic sensitizations.
D) As an indirect target organ for allergic sensitizations
acquired through other ways. In the case of predominant
digestive symptoms, diagnostic difficulties are
remarkable, because of: The similarity of digestive
allergic symptoms with other gastro-enterologic
diseases. The existence of different immunologic
mechanisms involved in the development of food
hypersensitivity phenomena. The possibility that the
hypersensitivity phenomenon be locally restricted,
without a detectable systemic reflection. This can
happens in the earlier stages of sensitization.
Conclusions: Anyway, considering the growing
prevalence of allergic disease in industrialized countries,
it is conceivable that digestive allergy is following the
same trend. In consequence, paediatricians should be
aware about this possibility in cases or recurrent or
persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly when
the child has concomitant allergic manifestations in
other organs.

Background and Aims: So far no causal therapy exists
for infants and toddlers with prolonged diarrhoea.
Therefore in a confirmatory, randomized, double-blind
clinical trial the efficacy of the probiotic bacterial strain
E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) as compared to a placebo was
tested.
Methods: 151 children (aged 1 to 47 months, Ø 25)
with unspecific prolonged diarrhoea (> 3 watery or
loose stools without blood in 24 hours of a diarrhoeal
episode, which has been persisting for more than 4
consecutive but less than 14 days) were randomized to
receive either EcN suspension (n = 75) or placebo
(n = 76). All children were dehydrated to a medium
extent (5 - 10% loss of body weight) and received 1 to 3
ml verum or placebo orally per day depending on the
age (1 ml verum contained 10E8 viable EcN bacteria)
for 21 days. At study commencement, rehydration (ORL
according to WHO) was performed once.
Results: Already on day 7 more patients in the EcN
(78.7%) than in the placebo group (59.2%) showed a
reduction of stool frequency to less than 3 watery or
loose stools in 24 hours over a period of at least 4
consecutive days. The response rate increased
continuously as was measured on days 14 (EcN 93.3%,
placebo 65.8%) and 21 (EcN 98.7%, placebo 71.1%).
The two-sample test of rates following a group
sequential test design showed statistically significant
superiority for EcN on both days 14 (p = 0.0017) and 21
(p<0.0001).
Conclusions: Prolonged diarrhoea can be successfully
treated with the probiotic EcN.

Background and Aims: To document the clinical
outcome and evidence of persisting dietary sensitization,
in particular, cow’s milk protein (CMP), in infants with
allergic colitis (AC).
Methods: We carried out a prospective study with
comprehensive immunological, endoscopic, clinical
evaluation and follow up for assessment of in vivo/in
vitro evidence of CMP-sensitivity. 12 AC were
diagnosed, median onset at 6weeks (2 days-7 months).
Clinical CMP-sensitivity was defined by resolution of
bloody diarrhoea on CMP exclusion (with maternal
dairy exclusion or amino-acid formula) and subsequent
rechallenge (open in breast-fed, double-blind challenge
in amino-acid formula fed). Clinical reactions to
sequential dietary antigen introduction during weaning
(soya/wheat/egg etc.) were documented.
Results: 10/12 had CMP-sensitivity, 5/10 showed
positive Th1/Th2 blood mononuclear responses (IFN- ,
IL-4, IL-5 cytokine production by ELISPOT to casein
and/or beta-lactoglobulin), 3/10 with Th2 lamina propria
CMP responses. 9/10 CMP-sensitive-AC were followed
up to median 23m (8-34m). One infant was lost to
follow-up before CMP rechallenge. CMP was tolerated
in 3 cases by 12m, 1 case by 18m and 2 cases by 24m. 3
cases remained CMP-sensitive at 21, 23 and 34m.
Multiple food allergy ( 2 antigens) with gastrointestinal
and/or cutaneous manifestations, both immediate and
delayed-onset, were observed in 6 CMP-sensitive cases
(soya, n=5; eggs, n=3; others, n=2; wheat, n=0).
Unrestricted diet was achieved in just 4/8 CMP-
sensitive-AC in the follow-up.
Conclusions: In this group of AC with early CMP-
sensitisation, clinical resolution and dietary tolerance
were variable and often delayed. Although this may
reflect a selective population, it highlights the
importance of longer term follow-up despite CMP
tolerance by 1yr.

Background and Aims: Health-related-quality-of-life
(HRQoL) is an important indicator of chronic illness,
complementary to clinical variables. Although
overweight and obesity affect HRQoL, very few studies
have assessed this in children and adolescents. In this
study we compared HRQoL of obese adolescents with
normal weight controls and we explored the relation of
Body Mass Index (BMI) with HRQoL.
Methods: Cross-sectional study in 31 adolescents
(12-18 yrs), referred for obesity, compared with 62 age
and sex matched controls. HRQoL was assessed using
the PedsQL and Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ). The
main outcome measure was difference in reported
HRQoL between the 2 groups and the association of
BMI with HRQoL in both groups.
Results: Mean BMI (SD) in patients vs controls was
34.9 (8.8) vs 19.5 (2.2) kg/m2.* In obese adolescents,
lower HRQoL in 3 PedsQL and 3 CHQ scales were
found.* Variance in HRQoL scales that was explained
by obesity ranged from 8% to 17%. BMI z-score was
inversely correlated with 5 PedsQL and 6 CHQ scales*
while the percentage of scale variance explained by
BMI z-score ranged from 5% to 23%. *p.<0.05.
Conclusions: HRQoL in obese adolescents is
significantly poorer than in normal weight controls and
is partially explained by obesity-related comorbidity.
Overall HRQoL was inversely associated with BMI.
When confirmed in other studies (change in) HRQoL
will become an important indicator of impact of obesity
and effect of interventions, complimentary to clinical
variables.

EFFECT OF DOMPERIDONE ON
GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX IN
NEWBORNS ASSESSED BY COMBINED
INTRALUMINAL IMPEDANCE AND PH
MONITORING
F Cresi, C Marinaccio, F Savino, L Silvestro,
R Miniero
Department of Pediatrics, University of Turin, Italy
Background and Aims: Gastroesophageal reflux
(GER) is common in the neonate. If conservative
procedures fail to relieve it, the use of a prokinetic
agents is justified. Domperidone has been shown to
increase LES pressure, to improve esophageal peristalsis
and gastric emptying in children. Aim of this study was
to evaluate effect of domperidone on gastroesophageal
reflux in newborns assessed by combined intraluminal
impedance (MII) and pH monitoring.
Methods: We performed a paired case control study in
26 formula fed newborns with GERD symptoms
referred to our Neonatal Care Unit. The patients were
consecutively enrolled and alternatively assigned to the
case or control group. MII and pH monitoring were
followed for 24 hr. Patients in the treatment group
received domperidone (0.2 mg/Kg dose q8 hr).
Simultaneous MII and pH monitoring identified reflux
episodes and illustrated their duration, height and pH.
Cases were matched to the control group. They were
paired by gestational age and weight. Differences were
evaluated with the t-test for paired values with p<0.05 as
the significance cut-off. Written consent was obtained
from the parents.
Results: Twenty-six (13:13) neonates were studied for a
total of 613,3 hours. The mean reflux duration was
lower for cases than controls (15,0±11,6 vs 21,44±11,3
sec), the reflux frequency was higher for cases than
controls (4,3±1,6 vs 3,0±2,5 episodes/hr), There were no
differences refluxes pH and height between the two
groups.
Conclusions: Efficacy of domperidone in GER
newborns needs to be reconsidered, since prokinetics
could amplify the gastroesophageal dismotility related
to immaturity of gastro-esophageal motor function in
these patients.
INHIBITORY EFFECT THE HERBAL

Background and Aims: Clinical evidence suggests that
a phytotherapeutic formulation containing Matricaria
recutita flowers extract, Foeniculum vulgare fruit extract
and Melissa officinalis aerial parts (ColiMil®) is
effective in the treatment of breastfed colicky infants
(1). We have now investigated the effect of different
dosages of herbal constituents on upper gastrointestinal
transit in mice in vivo to enhance our acknowledgement
on its supposed dose-dependent effect.
Methods: We have used 16 groups of 10 Male ICR
mice (20-22 g) for each experimental group. The mice
received orally 0.1ml/10g mouse of a black marker
(10% charcoal suspension in 5% gum arabic) 1 h before
oral administration of phytotherapeutic formulation
(0.1-0.4 ml/mouse), Matricariae recutita (0.22-0.89
mg/mouse), Foeniculum vulgare (2.05-8.21 mg/mouse)
or Melissa officinalis (1.61-6.46 mg/mouse). After 20
min the mice were killed by asphyxiation with CO2 and
the gastrointestinal tract removed. The distance travelled
by the marker was measured and expressed as a
percentage of the total length of the small intestine from
pylorus to caecum.
Results: The phytotherapeutic formulation dose-
dependently delayed upper gastrointestinal motility [(%
inhibition) 0.1 ml/mouse: 15% ± 6, 0.2 ml/mouse: 26%
± 5; 0.4 ml/mouse: 34% ± 4] (P<0.05). Among the
herbal components, Matricariae recutita and Melissa
officinalis, but not Foeniculum vulgare, reduced
motility.
Conclusions: It is concluded that the phytotherapeutic
formulation reduced upper gastrointestinal motility in
mice with a dose-dependent effect. These experimental
data may be important to better understand the
observation that a phytotherapeutic formulation
improves colic in breastfed infants. Reference:

LUNG DEVELOPMENT AND INFLAMMATION
A H Jobe
Professor of Neonatal Paediatrics, Department of
Pulmonary Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital
Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA
Background and Aims: Inflammation is central to
virtually all lung injury syndromes in the newborn and
adult. I will focus on antenatal and early postnatal
inflammatory effects on the preterm lung, as the effects
are directly relevant to bronchopulmonary dysplasia
(BPD). The chorioamnionitis frequently associated with
preterm delivery has two disparate effects on the fetal
lung - an injury similar to mild BPD with alveolar
simplification and microvascular injury and induced
lung maturation. The lung maturation results in less
clinical RDS but many of these infants progress to BPD,
perhaps because they have augmented inflammatory
responses to postnatal pro-inflammatory stimuli such as
resuscitation, lung stretch, and oxygen exposure.
Methods: We have used fetal sheep models to
demonstrate that intra-amniotic pro-inflammatory
mediators such as E. coli endotoxin, IL-1, or
Ureaplasma organisms cause chorioamnionitis and lung
inflammation. Following the fetal exposures to intra-
amniotic mediators, the fetal lungs are assessed for
inflammation (inflammatory cells, cytokine expression,
vascular injury), and lung maturation (gas exchange,
lung gas volumes, surfactant).
Results: The lung maturation requires the recruitment of
inflammatory cells to the fetal lung (demonstrated by
blocking CD-18 or IL-1 receptors). Lung inflammation
is mild, even with repetitive exposures to the mediators.
- 31 -
The inflammatory exposure also induces maturation of
monocytes to alveolar macrophages and modulates
systemic and lung innate immune responses. Ventilation
of the preterm sheep lung with tidal volumes of 15
ml/kg also initiates recruitment of monocytes and
granulocytes and induces pro-inflammatory cytokine
expression. Subsequent ventilation even after surfactant
treatment further increases the inflammatory response.
Any mechanical ventilation of the preterm lung likely
further promotes inflammation and injury, as does
oxygen exposure.
Conclusions: The combination of antenatal and/or
resuscitation induced injury and modulation of innate
inflammatory responses in the developing lung
contribute to the development of BPD.
SURFACTANTS TODAY AND TOMORROW
H L Halliday
Royal Maternity Hospital and Honorary Professor of
Child Health, Queens University Belfast, Northern
Ireland
Background and Aims: Surfactant treatment is now
about 25 years old and it has undoubtedly had a major
impact on neonatal care and outcomes. The aim was to
search for recent clinical trials of surfactant treatment
and report their results.
Methods: Recent was defined as published between
2000 and 2005. PubMed was searched on
31st December 2005 using the following terms:
surfactant treatment, neonate and clinical trials, with
limits of years 2000 to 2005 and age newborn to 1
month. Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and
systematic reviews of RCTs were given priority and
studies in children, adults and animals were excluded.
Results: Of the 175 papers found in the search about
half were directly related to some aspect of surfactant
treatment. Just over one-half of these were either RCTs
or systematic reviews. Three of the 34 RCTs of
surfactant treatment were excluded as they involved
children or animals. Twenty-nine RCTs studied preterm
babies with RDS and 2 RCTs term neonates with
meconium aspiration. The median sample sizes were 92
and 42 respectively. Eighteen of the RCTs for RDS
compared 2 or more surfactant preparations, with the
most frequently used being Curosurf and Survanta but
altogether 11 different surfactants were studied. Twelve
systematic reviews wewre found and these demonstrated
the superiority of delivery room surfactant over selective
use later in the neonatal unit in babies less than 30
weeks' gestation, natural over synthetic surfactants and
the absence of significant long-term developmental
problems. Of the non-randomised trials those reporting
novel delivery methods, the failure to use evidence-
based guidelines and the clear benefit of surfactant
treatment in babies of less than 25 weeks were the most
interesting.
Conclusions: Surfactant remains one of the most
effective and safest treatments in neonatal medicine.
Prophylactic natural surfactant is the most evidence-
based treatment for babies of less than 30 weeks. Of the
newer synthetic surfactants, only Surfaxin has been
compared with currently used surfactants and systematic
reviews may be needed to determine its role in the
treatment of RDS. Improvement in outcome of babies
less than 25 weeks has been due to a number of
interventions including prenatal steroids, prenatal
antibiotics and postnatal surfactant. RCTs of surfactant
treatment continue to be published remarkably
frequently.
LONG TERM RESPIRATORY OUTCOME
FOLLOWING PRE-TERM DELIVERY
J Stocks
Professor of Neonatal Paediatrics, Respiratory
Physiology, UCL, Institute of Child Health, London, UK
Background and Aims: Advances in neonatal care over
the last three decades have resulted in increased survival
of extremely preterm infants. However, the prevalence
of pulmonary sequelae has not declined as might have
been hoped or expected from improved management,
thereby increasing the burden of respiratory health care
delivery.
Methods: The residual respiratory problems of preterm,
low birth weight infants following discharge from
neonatal intensive care often persist into childhood with
significant respiratory morbidity, including frequent
cough and wheeze. Even in the absence of such
symptoms, there may be sub-clinical changes associated
with airway obstruction, hyperinflation, increased
airway reactivity and exercise limitation. These
problems may improve with age and somatic growth in
some individuals, but remain persistent in others.
Although those who required a high level of intensive
care or who developed chronic lung disease of infancy/
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, are more likely to be
affected beyond infancy, these adverse effects have also
been observed in children born prematurely but without
significant neonatal disease. Improved ongoing
surveillance of individuals born preterm is essential if
we are to understand the mechanisms and long term
impact of such early life insults.
Results: Despite a vast literature regarding respiratory
outcomes of preterm delivery during infancy (see recent
series on Lung Function in Infants with CLDI, in
Pediatric Pulmonology: 2005-2006), relatively little is
known about respiratory health of these subjects during
later childhood and adulthood, particularly in those with
severe neonatal disease in whom survival was so poor
prior to the 1980s. If research into the structural and
functional aspects of lung growth and development
following preterm delivery is to have any impact on
subsequent clinical practice, it is essential to develop
more objective physiological definitions of CLDI and to
discriminate between what we may be able to influence
(i.e. choice of therapeutic modalities) from that which
we cannot (such as effects of low birth weight and sex).
Consequently, research in this field is challenged by the
need to separate the independent effects of a) genetic
predisposition, b) preterm delivery per se, c) intrauterine
growth retardation d) neonatal respiratory disorders and
the related range of treatment strategies and e) impact of
early environmental insults (including exposure to
tobacco products and infections) on subsequent lung
growth and development (see also Stocks J. Pulmonary
- 32 -
function tests in infants and young children. In Chernick
V, Boat TF, Wilmott RW, Bush A, eds. Kendig's
disorders of the respiratory tract in children,
Philadelphia, USA: Elsevier, 2006).
Conclusions: Well designed multidisciplinary studies
are required to follow up graduates of modern neonatal
care, as their outcome may be very different to that of
cohorts recruited thirty, or even ten, years ago. We need
to learn what will happen to the aging lung in these
subjects and whether they are at increased risk of
acquiring early-onset respiratory failure or chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, in order to plan
appropriate services and inform future neonatal care.
A NEW APPROACH TO ACCELERATION OF
FETAL LUNG MATURATION BY
PIOGLITAZONE
F Guthmann, B Rüstow
Department of Neonatology, Charite-CCM, Berlin,
Germany
Background and Aims: The use of antenatal
glucocorticoids is one of the most important reasons for
the decreasing mortality of premature infants. However,
even with doses scaled to match those used in clinical
treatment of humans, side effects occurred in animal
brains. Thus, by studying a new approach we aim to
induce fetal lung maturation either instead of steroids or
supplemental to steroids.
Methods: We determined the expression of i) SP-B
which appears to be the most important apoprotein of
the surfactant with regard to the development of a
respiratory-distress syndrome, ii) SP-C, which increases
surfactant spreading and stability, and iii) ABCA3, a
transporter protein in the membrane of lamellar bodies
whose expression is inducible by corticosteroids in fetal
rat. ABCA3 is expressed in the rat in a development-
specific manner, and is detected earliest at day 20.5, i.e.
shortly before birth.
Results: We found that the PPARgamma ligand
pioglitazone, administered antenatally, induces the
expression of SP-A, B and C 3.6-, 38- and 6,5-fold,
respectively. ABCA3, hardly detectable at day 19.5, was
also drastically increased by pioglitazone as judged by
immunfluorescence. Increased ABCA3 is associated
with enhanced surfactant lipid synthesis. Incorporation
of [3H]palmitate into diacylglycerol or into
phosphatidylcholine increased around 5-fold in lung
homogenates of pioglitazone-treated rats compared to
controls.
Conclusions: We follow from the enhanced
phosphatidylcholine synthesis, the increased expression
of the surfactant apoproteins and ABCA3, a transport
protein being important for the synthesis of surfactant
that the antenatal administration of pioglitazone can
induce the biochemical maturation of the lung.

Background and Aims: ABCA3 is a type II
pneumocyte phospholipid carrier essential for surfactant
synthesis. ABCA3 deficiency causes lethal neonatal
RDS and pediatric interstitial lung disease. Most cases
carry ABCA3 mutations on both alleles. We
investigated relatives of ABCA3-deficient infants for
determining whether heterozygosis leads to subclinical
respiratory impairment.
Methods: Genotype was determined by sequencing of
PCR-amplified genomic DNA in neonates with
suspected genetic surfactant deficiency and relatives.
Airway patency was measured by FEV1 in all, except
neonates in whom tPTEF/Te was used; functional lung
volumes were measured by RV/TLC, except in neonates
in whom Vt was used. Alveolar exchange was measured
by carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (KCO) in
subjects >5 years, and estimated by PaO2/FiO2 ratio <5
years.
Results: Case 1 carried an ABCA3 homozygote
frameshift mutation on exon 23 (3997del AG) leading to
complete ABCA3 deficiency. Case 2 carried biallelic
heterozygote missense mutations on exons 6/7. Both
died in neonatal period. Case 3, who presented moderate
interstial disease from birth, carried a heterozygote
missense mutation on exon 8. No SpB and SpC
mutations were found. 10 heterozygotes were studied,
including case 3. All showed normal airway resistances.
Lung volumes were normal except case 3 (Vt 5.1cc).
Alterations of KCO were found in relatives carrying
C439T and C643T (66.7 vs 95.6% of predictive value),
suggestive of subclinical interstitial disease. PaO2/FiO2
in case 3 was 115 (normal: >200), suggesting
moderate/severe interstitial disease.
Conclusions: Certain heterozygote ABCA3 mutations
may lead to subclinical interstitial lung disease in
children and adults, and may be associated with more
severe pediatric interstitial lung disease.

Hospitals and Clinics, University of Missouri-Kansas
City School of Medicine, Kansas City, MO, USA
Background and Aims: Nitric Oxide (NO) is a
mediator of pulmonary transition to postnatal life.
Prematurity and CLD of prematurity may alter ontogeny
of NOS expression or function of the NO pathways.
NOS presence and NO production in fetal lungs have
not been correlated. One key pathway of NO
- 33 -
metabolism results in nitrotyrosine, a stable, measurable
marker of NO production. We compared, by
semiquantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC), NOS
isoforms and nitrotyrosine at different pulmonary
airway and vascular levels in neonates at different
gestations and severities of CLD.
Methods: Postmortem lung blocks were compared
using IHC, with antibodies to each NOS isoform and
nitrotyrosine. Blinded observers evaluated airway and
vascular trees for staining intensity (0-3 scale). Controls,
postconceptional age 22-42 week infants who died in
<48 hours, were compared to gestational-matched
infants with varying CLD severity.
Results: All three NOS isoforms stained in airway
epithelium (bronchus to alveolus) in control and CLD
groups. Abundance or distribution of NOS-3 airway
staining did not correlate with gestation or CLD
severity. In the vasculature, intense NOS-3, moderate
NOS-2, and inconsistent NOS-1 staining was found.
Nitrotyrosine stained in the pulmonary tree. Compared
to controls where nitrotyrosine staining was minimal,
regardless of gestation, infants with severe CLD
revealed >4 fold increase (p<0.001).
Conclusions: All three NOS isoforms and nitrotyrosine
are detectable by IHC early in lung development. NOS
ontogeny shows no significant changes in abundance or
distribution with advancing gestational age or with
CLD. However, Nitrotyrosine, a marker of NO
production, is significantly increased in severe CLD
airways, which may have clinical implications.
RESPIRATORY COMPLICATIONS IN
CHILDREN WITH NEUROMUSCULAR
DISORDERS
B Fauroux
AP-HP, Hopital Armand Trousseau, Department of
Pediatric Pulmonary, Research Unit INSERM U719,
Universite Pierre et Marie Curie - Paris 6, France
Background and Aims: In patients with neuromuscular
diseases, the development of respiratory muscle
weakness represents the major determinant of the
respiratory morbidity and mortality. As such, the
measurement of lung volumes have been demonstrated
to be an useful marker of the severity of the respiratory
disease in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy
(DMD) (1). Routine evaluation of forced vital capacity
(FVC), maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure and
peak cough flow is suggested early in the course of the
disease by the American Thoracic Society (2). However,
noninvasive volitional tests of lung and respiratory
muscle function can be misleading because these tests
require aptitude, cooperation, motivation and
coordination, which explains that reliable measures may
be difficult to obtain in young children.
Methods: In order to evaluate inspiratory and expiratory
muscle strength in children with various neuromuscular
diseases, 41 patients, aged 2 to 18 years, with DMD
(n=20), spinal amyotrophy (n=8), and congenital
myopathy (n=13), were asked to perform a sniff and a
cough maneuver, as well as a FVC maneuver. In
addition, diaphragmatic strength was assessed by a non-
volitional test, i.e the magnetic stimulation of the
phrenic nerves (TwPdi) (3).
Results: All the patients were able to perform the sniff
and the cough maneuver, whereas only 25 (61%)
patients were able to perform FVC. Sniff
transdiaphragmatic pressure decreased with age in
patients with DMD whereas it increased with age in
patients with spinal amyotrophy and congenital
myopathy. Magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves
was obtained in all patients and in the three groups of
patients, a significant correlation was observed between
the volitional sniff maneuver and the non-volitional test
of diaphragmatic strength, i.e. TwPdi. Also, FVC
correlated with sniff transdiaphragmatic pressure and
cough gastric pressure. In patients with DMD, minute
ventilation and lung volumes, assessed by functional
residual capacity and FVC, decreased with age. Thus, in
DMD patients, the progression of respiratory muscle
weakness with age translates into the development of
alveolar hypoventilation. Indeed, the patients with DMD
who required non-invasive positive pressure ventilation
(NPPV) had significantly weaker inspiratory and
expiratory muscles and a lower FVC than those who did
not need NPPV. Respiratory muscle output, as reflected
by the oesophageal (PTPes) and the diaphragmatic
pressure-time products (PTPdi), which represents the
work of breathing, was also calculated. In all patients,
the PTPes and PTPdi were 2 to 3 times normal values,
whatever the diagnosis and age of the patients. This
increase in respiratory muscle output may be explained
by the microatelectasis, the 'stiffening' and the deformity
of the chest and contributes to the ventilatory imbalance.
Conclusion: In conclusion, the natural history of
respiratory muscle weakness depends on the type of
neuromuscular disease. But in these patients, alveolar
hypoventilation develops as a consequence of the
respiratory muscle weakness. The moderate increase in
respiratory load may contribute further to the ventilatory
imbalance. References: 1. Smith PEM, Calverley PMA,

PHOX2B GENE AND THE INTIMATE
RELATIONSHIP WITH DYSAUTONOMY
C Gaultier
Department of Physiology, Hôpital Robert Debré, Paris,
France
Background and Aims: Congenital central
hypoventilation syndrome, Hirschsprung disease, and
neuroblastomas can occur in combination, and familial
cases have been reported in all three conditions. This
suggests variable expression of a single genetic
abnormality as the common cause to these neural crest
disorders. Because the PHOX2B gene is pivotal in the
- 34 -
development of most relays of the autonomic nervous
system, including all autonomic neural crest derivatives,
it was considered a candidate gene for the above
conditions.
Methods: Molecular genetic analyses were performed
in children with CCHS, Hirschsprung disease, and
neuroblastomas.
Results: Recent studies have shown that: (i) PHOX2B
is the main disease-causing gene for congenital central
hypoventilation syndrome, an autosomal dominant
disorder. Most of the mutations consisted in alanine
expansions within the polyalanine stretch of PHOX2B
exon. (ii) PHOX2B is the first gene for which germline
mutations have been demonstrated to predispose to
neuroblastoma. (iii) Hirschsprung disease was
associated with an intronic single-nucleotide
polymorphism of the PHOX2B gene in a case-control
study.
Conclusions: To clarify the variable clinical expression
of the autonomic nervous system dysfunction observed
in paediatric disorders with dysautonomy, international
databases of clinical symptoms and molecular test
results should be established. Furthermore, the
development of genetic mouse models should help to
improve our understanding of the molecular
mechanisms underlying neural crest disorders.

Background and Aims: To investigate the effects of a
single course of antenatal betamethasone on cognition-
and anxiety-related behavior and synaptophysin- and
microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)- immuno-
reactivity in the adult rat hippocampus.
Methods: On day 20 of gestation pregnant rats were
injected with either 1) 170 g kg-1 body weight of
betamethasone ('clinically-equivalent dose', equivalent
to 12 mg twice, 24 hours apart), 2) Half this dose or 3)
Vehicle. Cognition- and anxiety- related behavior of the
offspring was analyzed at an age of 5 months using the
Morris water maze, object recognition task and open
field test. Subsequently, synaptophysin- and MAP2-
immunoreactivity were measured in the hippocampus.
Results: We report no detrimental effects of antenatal
betamethasone on cognition- and anxiety-related
behavior and synaptophysin-immunoreactivity in the
adult rat. On the other hand, MAP2-immunoreactivity
was decreased by betamethasone in males. The lower
dose had less influence in terms of fetal growth
restriction.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest a permanent
impairment in the hippocampus following a single
course of antenatal betamethasone. Further research
might elucidate whether the betamethasone effect on
hippocampal neurons persists later in life and could
affect the aging process increasing the risk for
neuropathology of the adult. Moreover, lowering the
dose appears to reduce the steroid effect on fetal growth
restriction - known to be associated with an increased
risk of disease in adulthood. (Acknowledgements:

Background and Aims: Babies have been shown to
reproduce mouth opening and closing in response to an
adult model within a few hours after birth. This neonatal
oral imitation is observed only in humans and great apes
such as chimpanzees, indicating that this oral function is
innate and mostly specific in humans. In this study, we
investigated the possibility whether patients with severe
motor dysfunction demonstrated similar imitation seen
in neonate.
Methods: Fourteen patients were included in this study.
They were rarely able to vocalize or move their
extremities voluntarily. First, a therapist sang a favorite
song of each patient for five minutes. Then, the therapist
sang a part of it repeatedly with mouse widely and
slowly open while making eye contact with the patient.
Patients were evaluated as being able to perform oral
imitation when they opened their mouth repeatedly in
response to the therapists’ oral movement.
Results: Seven patients (50%) showed oral imitation.
Three patients did not move their mouth and four were
difficult to be evaluated.
Conclusions: Half of patients with severe motor
dysfunction demonstrated similar oral imitation
observed in neonate, supporting the subcortical control
hypothesis of neonatal imitation. On the other hand,
- 35 -
singing favorite songs was necessary to induce it,
suggesting the involvement of higher brain function.
Imitation is considered to precede theory of mind and
provide an innate foundation for social cognition even in
primitive neonatal imitation. Even patients with severe
motor dysfunction were shown to communicate with
others by oral imitation.

Background and Aims: We determined the factors
associated with electrographic status epilepticus in sleep
(ESES) and sleep-activated epileptiform abnormalities
(SAEA) among children with autism and/or regression
referred for EEG-video studies.
Methods: Data on all children who were referred for
24- hour EEG-video monitoring from 1995-2005 with a
question of possible ESES or SAEA were entered into a
database for analysis. Senior pediatric neurologists
evaluated all children at the time of admission to
determine whether children met diagnostic criteria for
autism or an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), or if they
had isolated language regression (language regression
without autistic features).
Results: 121 children (64% male) were referred for
EEG-video monitoring to evaluate for possible SAEA or
ESES. 56 of 121 (46%) children had language, autistic,
and/or cognitive/behavioral regression. 66 children had
clinical features of autism; 13 children experienced
global autistic regression. Of the 33 children with
isolated language regression, 19 (58%) had SAEA and
11 (33%) had ESES. Only 1 child with ESES did not
have isolated language regression. No child with a
diagnosis of global autistic regression had ESES.
Isolated language regression was strongly associated
with SAEA (odds ratio = 3.07; 95% CI = 1.34, 7.00) and
with ESES (odds ratio = 43.5, 95% CI = 5.33, 355.1).
Autistic features were not associated with ESES (odds
ratio = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.49) and or SAEA (odds
ratio = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.14, 0.67).
Conclusions: Isolated language regression, not autism,
was strongly associated with SAEA and ESES.

Background and Aims: PDS is a rare, autosomal
recessively inherited disorder. Recently PDS was shown
to result from AASDH (antiquitin) deficiency, elevated
levels of both AASA and PA, that can be used to
confirm the diagnosis.
Methods: We reevaluated the recently reported series of
Dutch PDS patients (Arch Dis Child 90:1293-1296) by
measuring AASA and PA in urine and plasma of all
patients (n=13). Because of the ongoing epidemiologic
study newly diagnosed patients could be added (n=6).
Results: AASA was elevated in urine and plasma and
PA in plasma in most suspected PDS patients (Table). In
all patients with definite PDS and in most with probable
or possible PDS according to the criteria published by
Baxter, the diagnosis of PDS could be confirmed. The
birth incidence of 'metabolic proven' PDS in the
Netherlands was calculated to be 1:212,000.
Conclusions: This report is the first nationwide
population-based study on metabolic confirmed PDS.
This study shows that most patients were diagnosed
correctly using the Baxter criteria. Metabolic screening
of the L-lysine metabolism provides a tool to
discriminate between patients with 'classical PDS' and
other types of neonatal seizures including pyridoxine
responsive seizures.

Background and Aims: Hyperoxia and Hyperoxemia-
induced oxidative stress may modulate the expression of
specific genes in various organs. Whereas the effects of
hyperoxia and hyperoxemia on the developing lungs and
retina have been well documented, their effects on
developing brain have not been systematically studied.
Therefore, we examined, in the present study,
differential gene expression in whole brain of neonatal
rats exposed to 3 days of normobaric hyperoxia before
- 36 -
the onset of the clinical signs of pulmonary oxygen
toxicity.
Methods: Sixteen newborn male Sprague Dawley rats
were randomly divided into an hyperoxia-treated group
(72 h, consisting of 98%, 60% and 40% O2 breathing at
days 1-3, respectively), or controls (21% O2) (n=8 in
each group). After 72 hours, the pups were euthanized
and their brain was rapidly removed and analyzed for
differential gene expression, using 9984 oligonucleotide
rat array. Samples from both groups were assigned to
single slides for the purpose of direct (low variance)
comparison. Bonferroni correction was used to control
the experimental Type I error at alpha level of 0.05.
Results: Seventy-two hours of graded exposure to
hyperoxia was not associated with statistically
significant changes in differential gene expression in the
whole brain of newborn rats, as compared to controls.
Conclusions: Seventy-two hours of graded hyperoxia,
in the absence of the clinical signs of pulmonary oxygen
toxicity, does not affect the whole brain differential gene
expression in neonatal rats. Whether hyperoxia in the
newborn rats can modify the genomic profile of
individual neuroanatomical structures requires further
investigation.

Background and Aims: Recently, in both Belgium
(Flanders) and the Netherlands, studies have been done
to get insight in the practice of end-of-life decision-
making for neonates and infants. We compared the
results to gain insight in similarities and differences
between these countries.
Methods: Questionnaires were sent to physicians who
reported the death of a child who died under the age of
one (Belgium: n=292, response 87%; Netherlands:
n=249, response 84%). The questionnaires included
structured questions about whether death had been
preceded by end-of-life decisions, and about the
decision-making process.
Results: In both countries, in about 25% of all deaths a
life-sustaining treatment was withheld. In Belgium a
life-sustaining treatment was less often withdrawn than
in the Netherlands (32%, 50% respectively). In both
countries, in about 40% pain or other symptoms were
alleviated taking into account that death might be
hastened. Drugs were administered with the explicit
intention of hastening death in similar percentages of all
deaths (Belgium: 7%; Netherlands: 9%), but Dutch
physicians more often estimated the shortening of life
more than one week than Belgian physicians. In the
Netherlands, the decision was more often than in
Belgium discussed with parents (96%, 81%
respectively), and with colleague-physicians (94%, 80%
respectively). In Belgium, the decision was discussed
with nurses in 32%, and in the Netherlands in 27%.
Conclusions: End-of-life decision-making in severely
ill neonates and infants seems to be rather similar in
Belgium and the Netherlands. Differences are that
Dutch physicians more often withdraw life-sustaining
treatment and decide to administer drugs with the
intention of hastening death in an earlier stage.
END OF LIFE DECISIONS IN CRITICALLY ILL
INFANTS; DIVERSITY WITHIN EUROPE
P J J Sauer
Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center
Groningen, The Netherlands
Within Europe a variety in opinions exists among
neonatologists and intensivists concerning the question
when to start and when to stop or continue life-saving
treatment in a critically ill infant. In some countries
physicians feel they have the obligation to discuss these
issues with parents and, ultimately, to make decisions
while in other countries physicians are convinced that
these decisions are not part of the medical domain.
Quality of life aspects are taken into account in the
decision-making process in some countries while in
other countries the future quality of life can never be an
argument in these decision-making processes. Next to
the future quality of life, the presence of suffering can
be an aspect in the decision-making process. In some
countries physicians are convinced that all suffering can
always be sufficiently and effectively treated with
medication. In The Netherlands it is accepted that it is
not possible to effectively alleviate suffering in all
patients with medication and that active ending the life
in some infants can be the only way to alleviate
suffering. In these extreme situations actively ending the
life of an infant is considered to be acceptable in The
Netherlands, while in other countries it is considered to
be murder. Are opinions regarding these ethical
questions indeed very different between countries, and if
so, do we know why these differences exist? Or, on the
other hand, is it mainly the way we discuss these
inssues. In my opinion differences in opinion exist.
However, they are not as extreme as they might like.
Secondly, physicians are influenced by the cultural and
religious environment, and also by the legal system. An
open discussion regarding these issues is very important
within Europe. Not that one opinion is superior over the
other, but these discussions can help physicians in
different countries to make their view and thereby the
decision making more clear and explicit. Discussing
these issues therefore is not telling what is wrong and
what is right, but will help to make proper decisions.
Ethics is not the science that makes decisions, but the
science that helps to assistent by formulating the proper
questions in the decision-making process.

- 37 -
Background and Aims: Many deaths on a Paediatric
Intensive Care Unit (PICU) can be anticipated. This
gives an opportunity to share decisions with parents, and
manage a child’s end of life care accordingly. We
present a review of deaths on a PICU over a 30 month
period and three cases to illustrate differences in end of
life care. Methods: The ‘mode’ of death of all children
who died in 2003-2006 was categorised: 1. brain stem
death, 2. unsuccessful attempts at resuscitation, 3.
withdrawal/limitation of therapy. In the latter, the
circumstances leading to this decision were noted along
with the process, timing and place of therapy
withdrawal. Results: There were 53 deaths (6%) out of
883 admissions. In 29 cases (55%), children died
following withdrawal or limitation of therapy. Sixteen
deaths (30%) followed unsuccessful attempts of full
resuscitation. Eight children (15%) died from brain stem
death. In the majority of cases, medical staff initiated
discussions regarding withdrawal of therapy, usually
several discussions took place. Therapy was withdrawn
with family present in all cases. Conclusions: The
majority of deaths on PICU follow withdrawal or
limitation of therapy and can therefore be anticipated.
End of life care is discussed with families, so their
wishes can be taken into account when managing
children dying on PICU. This is a very emotive and
challenging area for intensive care, and raises many
complex ethical and operational issues. The quality of
care at the end of life should be investigated by
examining the family’s perceptions of such care.

Background and Aims: Geographic variations in
physician practices of withdrawal of life sustaining
treatment (WLST) are reported. However, practical
aspects of decision making, the withdrawal process and
how to support bereaved parents are poorly described.
Moreover, parents’ perspectives are infrequently
discussed. Our purpose was to generate key elements of
importance from parents who had experienced WLST in
the NICU. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were
conducted with parents of infants who underwent WLST
within the last 3 years in a tertiary NICU. Parents were
asked to describe the events surrounding discussions of
decision making, WLST, and follow-up care. Interviews
continued to saturation, then were independently coded
and reduced. Results: Seven interviews generated 139
items important to parents, organized into 6 themes:
Communication e.g. not to be given false hope; not to
pass value judgments. Quality of care e.g. continuity of
the care plan; that everything possible has been done.
Quality of life e.g. balance suffering in life against long
term outcome. Decision making e.g. parents feel
supported whatever their decision; parents feel the right
decision was made. WLST e.g. parents be guided
through the steps of WLST. Post-bereavement e.g.
retaining a sense of their child’s identity; availability of
doctors to answer questions. Conclusions: A working
set of items important in the delivery of compassionate
WLST has been generated based on informed parents’
experiences. We are now using these key items to
develop a learning package for teaching WLST in the
NICU. (This project was funded by a resident award
from Physician Services Incorporated, Toronto).

Background and Aims: In a third level university
hospital a review committee on End-of-life care in
Children in the Academic Hospital Maastricht
(RECAM) was formed to review medical decision-
making surrounding the deaths of children younger than
16 years old. Methods: A set of criteria was
formulated: the establishment of diagnosis and
prognosis of the illness, hopeless and unbearable
suffering, communication with the parents, the
consultation with other physicians, and the performance
of the end of life care. Results: The RECAM reviewed
48 cases, in which in 40 cases a medical end-of-life
decision was made. In all cases, the medical decision
was repeatedly discussed with the parents. Other
physicians were consulted. In 22% of the reported cases
current suffering was deemed unbearable, whereas in all
cases unbearable suffering in the future was deemed. In
42% a decision was made to continue or increase the
pain medication without the intention to advance death.
In 23% medication was given with the intention to
advance death. In 10% the RECAM concluded that the
doctor's stated intentions did not correspond to the
medication given. Conclusions: We conclude that all
end-of-life decisions were judged to be in accordance
with criteria of due care. We recommend that all cases
with an intentional shortening of life should be the
object of ethical and legal evaluation by a national
review committee.
SHOULD NEONATES OR INFANTS BE DENIED
THE RIGHT TO LIFE: THE LEGAL
IMPLICATIONS OF LIFE-THREATENING
DECISIONS IN ENGLAND AND WALES
R Stanley
Faculty of Health and Social Care Sciences, Kingston
University and St. George's University of London,
Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, UK
Background and Aims: Children too young and
immature to be competent depend on their parents to
- 38 -
fulfil their rights to good health and medical care. The
advances made by medical technology nevertheless
sometimes confront parents and doctors alike with
difficult dilemmas over what is the appropriate decision
to make. Does a child, for example, have a right to life,
at whatever the cost? In questions like this the medical
profession wields considerable power and it is the
doctors who may in reality decide how best to fulfil a
child's rights. In the event of a dispute between parents
and doctors, the courts may be asked to intervene. At
that point, medical paternalism may be replaced by
judicial paternalism, with the child's own perspectives
slipping into second place. This aim of this analysis of
the neonates' right to life (or death) deals with the extent
to which children's right to life can be endangered by
decisions relating to their. Specifically this discussion
will address 3 objectives: (i) The limits to parents'
powers and the relevance of physical or mental handicap
(ii) A child's right to life and parents' objections to life-
saving treatment. (iii) Withholding treatment from
desperately ill babies.
Methods: This discussion brings together the analytic
methodologies of jurisprudence and philosophy. As
legal philosophy is nothing else that general philosophy
applied to law, it uses the same methodology as
philosophy in general. Legal theory, for its part, lays an
emphasis on plural and interdisciplinary approaches, in
addition to the more traditional analytical methodology.
Results: The law continues to cause difficulties for
doctors and parents who may be unable to determine in
advance what the child's quality of life will be if medical
intervention continues. Doctors have an unenviable task
when managing the treatment of these babies. Although
there have been calls for legislation to clarify the law on
neonaticide, the enormity of the moral and legal
problems facing an intending legislator makes the
prospect of legislation remote. There are obviously no
right or wrong answers, but it is certainly unrealistic to
claim that every child has a right to life; some children
even have the right to die.
Conclusion: Doctors increasingly influence the extent
to which children's rights are protected when decisions
are made regarding treatment. Although they have the
expertise to protect children's medical rights, they are
not necessarily in the best position to advise over rights,
such as a child's right to bodily integrity, to be
consulted, and treated with respect. But whilst doctors
are not always the best judges of what is in the child's
best interests, nor are the parents, who not surprisingly
may find it impossible to be objective over the decisions
to be made. The courts too may lose sight of their duty
to protect the child's own rights from being infringed by
decisions which appear to be in the best interests but
which may be more to do with those of her carers.
Children's rights should not be lost somewhere in the
middle, between parental, medical and judicial
paternalism.

Background and Aims: Recent epidemiological
evidence has shown increased rates of cardiovascular
mortality and associated risk factors in those born small.
However scarce information exists concerning
cardiovascular risk factors in adulthood following
preterm birth, or distinguishing the relative contributions
of length of gestation and fetal growth to small size at
birth.
Methods: Prospective follow-up of 458 thirty-year olds
whose mothers took part in a randomised controlled trial
of antenatal betamethasone for the prevention of
neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (147 born at
term, 311 born preterm). Follow-up assessments
included anthropometry, blood pressure, blood lipids,
early morning cortisol levels and 75g oral glucose
tolerance test.
Results: Gestational age at birth, preterm birth, and
birth weight z score, were not associated with serum
cholesterol, triglyceride or cortisol at age 30. However a
low gestational age at birth, and preterm birth, were
associated with increased systolic blood pressure
(p value for preterm birth=0.009) and insulin resistance
at age 30 (p value for preterm birth=0.006). Birth
weight, adjusted for gestational age, was not associated
with these outcomes.
Conclusions: Adults who were born moderately
preterm have increased blood pressure and insulin
resistance at 30 years of age. Preterm birth rather than
poor fetal growth is the major determinant of this. As
both the incidence of preterm birth and survival amongst
those born preterm are increasing, this group may
contribute an increasing proportion of overall
cardiovascular disease burden in developed countries.

Background and Aims: We reported that the
combination of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
plus predonisolone as the initial treatment of Kawasaki
disease (KD) proved more effective in preventing
coronary artery abnormalities than IVIG alone.
However, the routine use of corticosteroids may demand
careful study because they can be associated with
potential adverse reactions. This study aimed to
demonstrate the effectiveness of IVIG plus
predonisolone by risk stratification.
- 39 -
Methods: 178 KD patients were randomly assigned to
either an IVIG group (n=88) or an IVIG plus
predonisolone (IVIG+PSL) group (n=90). KD patients
were stratified into high or low risk groups by a risk
score developed to predict IVIG unresponsiveness from
a multiple logistic regression analysis using our
institutions 750 consecutive KD patients.
Results: 42 patients in the IVIG group and 45 in the
IVIG+PSL group were classified into the high risk
group. In the low risk group, clinical outcomes were
similar between the two groups (initial treatment failure,
4.3% vs. 0%: recurrence 0% vs. 2.2%: coronary artery
abnormalities, 2.2% vs. 0%, respectively). In the high
risk group, the incidence of initial treatment failure and
coronary artery abnormalities was more frequent in the
IVIG group (initial treatment failure 33.3% vs. 11.1%,
P=0.025: coronary artery abnormalities 21.4% vs. 4.4%,
P=0.023, respectively).
Conclusions: IVIG+PSL improved coronary and
clinical outcomes in the high risk group. If KD patients
are considered at high risk using our risk score, they
should be treated with IVIG+PSL as the initial
treatment.

Background and Aims: To evaluate the effect of being
small for gestational age (SGA), defined as birth weight
less than the fifth percentile for gestational age, on
neonatal mortality and morbidity.
Methods: In this study, prospective data was collected
on all births of 22 to 27 completed weeks of gestation,
or a birth weight of 500 to 999 g born during the years,
1999 and 2000 in Norway. Of 636 births, 174 infants
were stillborn or died in the delivery room, and data
from the remaining 462 were included in the study. Of
these, 86 died in the NICU, 87 (19 percent) infants had
birth weight < 5p (SGA), and 372 (81 percent) infants
had birth weight >= 5p (AGA). Mortality and presence
of selected neonatal morbidity such as severe cerebral
haemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),
periventricular leukomalaci, retinopathy of prematurity,
chronic lung disease (CLD- defined as need of oxygen
at 36 weeks), persistent ductus arteriosus and total days
on ventilator/CPAP were compared between the two
groups.
Results: The SGA infants had an almost fourfold
mortality, a tripled risk of NEC and a doubled risk of
CLD. Similarly, there was an increase in the mean
number of total days on ventilator/CPAP support. There
were no differences between the SGA-group and the
AGA-group in frequency of severe cerebral
haemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, periventricular
leukomalaci, or persistent ductus arteriosus. All
analyzes were adjusted for gestational age.
Conclusions: We found indications of increased
neonatal mortality and morbidity associated with being
born before 28 weeks of gestation and being small-for-
gestational age.

Background and Aims: NO reduces PVR, improves
oxygenation without altering systemic haemodynamics.
Rebound PHT upon withdrawal of NO causes
desaturation, hypotension and major instability.
Sildenafil, a pulmonary vasodilator increases intrinsic
cGMP levels by preventing its breakdown Aim is to
establish whether sildenafil has a role in the preventing
rebound PHT
Methods: Infants ventilated and receiving NO at 5 parts
per million (ppm) or more were eligible. 30 infants were
randomised to enteral sildenafil (0.35mg/kg) or placebo.
NO weaned by 1 ppm every half hour and study drug
given when NO was weaned to 2 ppm. Arterial pressure,
CVP, HR, O2 saturations, ABG and PAP were recorded.
Data expressed as means (SD) or median (ranges)
Results: 15 patients randomised to each group. Median
age (yrs) 0.47 (0.13 – 1.31) for sildenafil and 0.28 (0.1–
0.81) in placebo group. Baseline PAP was 36.5 (12.9)
mmHg in sildenafil group, 30.8 (9.0) mmHg for
placebo. Sildenafil did not cause hypotension,
vasodilation or worsening oxygenation. 4 (28%) in
placebo group suffered rebound PHT needing
recommencement of NO (none in sildenafil group).
Mean PAP (%) between baseline and 1 hour after
stopping NO is shown in fig. Rebound was associated
with increase in ventilation time
Conclusions: Sildenafil is safe and effective for
preventing rebound PHT and also reduced

CORRELATION OF GESTATIONAL AGE WITH
EXPRESSION OF EPITHELIAL SODIUM
CHANNEL (ENaC) IN AIRWAY EPITHELIUM
OF NEWBORN INFANTS
C Janér, O Helve, O Pitkänen, S Andersson
Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Helsinki,
Finland
Background and Aims: The fetal lung is filled with
liquid that is removed perinatally. Animal
experimentation has shown that epithelial sodium
channel (ENaC) is rate limiting for clearance of this
liquid. In the newborn mouse knock-out of the alpha
subunit of the ENaC gene results in early death due to
respiratory distress. Human infants that die of
respiratory distress shortly after birth have been shown
to have a high fluid content of the lungs. Delayed fluid
absorption because of low expression of ENaC may thus
play a role in the pathogenesis of respiratory distress in
the preterm human infant. We therefore studied whether
in the early postnatal period a relationship exists
between airway expression of subunits of ENaC and
gestational age in newborn infants.
Methods: From 74 newborn infants with gestational age
of 26-42 weeks scrape samples from nasal epithelium
were taken within 1-6 hours after birth. The expression
of alpha, beta and gamma subunit of ENaC was
quantified using RT-PCR.
Results: A significant correlation existed between the
expression of alpha ENaC and gestational age at 1-6
hours after birth (n=74, r=0.393, p=0.0006) and at 22-28
hours after birth (n=65, r=0.294, p=0.0175. The
expression of beta ENaC correlated with gestational age
at 1-6 hours after birth (n=72, r=0.2717, p=0.020). In
contrast, there was no significant correlation between
gamma ENaC and gestational age.
Conclusions: Insufficient expression of subunits of
ENaC in airway epithelium during the early postnatal
period may contribute to the pathogenesis of respiratory
distress in the preterm infant.
TRANSPORT OF NEWBORNS WITH ACUTE
LUNG FAILURE IN THE PRE-ECMO
SITUATION AND ON ECMO
M Schindler, S Dahlmann, I Berlett, F Loersch
University Childrens Hospital, Mannheim, Germany
Background and Aims: Although ventilation and
postpartal management of sick newborns has been
optimized, ECMO remains a therapeutic option in the
neonatal intensive care of acute lung failure. The
ECMO-center Mannheim has performed about 300
ECMO cases since 1987, and currently performs about
25 ECMOs per year. 50 infants per year are evaluated
for the option of ECMO-therapy. Half of them are born
at the center and the others are transported to the
ECMO-center. Some children are too ill for
conventional transport, in which case iNO, HFOV or
mobile ECMO is necessary.
Results: In the last 5 years we have transported about
50 newborns to our ECMO-center, more than 70% of
them needing iNO or HFOV. 5 children were
transported under transport ECMO. Last year we started
to installe a special Transport-ECMO unit on a
Transport system, which can be used in a standard
ambulance or by helicopter. On this transportation unit
we use a rollerpump, a ventilator, a heating pump and
12 perfusion pumps. Energy is generated by a UPSU.
During the transport the energy comes from the vehicle
or helicopter. All 5 newborns transported with this unit
have survived and could later have been discharged. The
cannulas are placed either by surgeon from the referring
hospital or by a surgeon accompanying our transport
team.
Conclusions: Special trained transport teams and
special equipment are necessary for transporting
critically ill children. Transport under ECMO is feasible
but remains a high-risk modality that should not replace
the prenatal and early postnatal transport to an ECMO
center.
NEW TECHNOLOGY IN BRAIN IMAGING IN
THE NEONATE
P S Hüppi
Department of Pediatrics, University of Geneva,
Geneva, Switzerland
Despite marked improvements in perinatal practice,
perinatal brain injury remains one of the most common
complications causing chronic handicapping conditions.
In recent years remarkable experimental advances have
elucidated many of the cellular and vascular
mechanisms of perinatal brain damage showing a
correlation between the nature of the injury and the
maturation of the brain. Advanced Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) techniques have recently provided us
with new data on fine structural alteration of the brain in
these high risk newborns and have helped us to
understand the brains structural alterations and their
consequences for later brain development. MRI provides
unequaled sensitivity as compared to CT or ultrasound
for evaluating developmental changes and the
pathological processes in the perinatal brain. Diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI), a recent MR modality which
assesses water diffusion in biological tissues at a
microstructural level, has revealed a powerful technique
to explore the structural basis of normal brain
development. In fact, the tissue organization can be
probed non-invasively, and the age-related changes of
diffusion parameters (mean diffusivity, anisotropy)
- 41 -
reveal important maturational processes, such as white
matter myelination. Early detection of brain injury is
crucial for interventions aimed at preventing and
reversing ongoing injury. DTI can show early changes at
the cellular level that are not detectable by any other
imaging modality. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(MRS) further allows us to some extent to study the
underlying metabolic mechanisms that define the
pathophysiologic events that take place in perinatal
brain injury. Understanding early human brain
connectivity is of great clinical importance, as many
neurological and neurobehavioral disorders have their
origin in early structural and functional cerebral
organization. With the development of 3D fiber
tractography, based on DTI, the maturation of white
matter connectivity can be followed throughout infant
development into adulthood with the potential to study
correlations between abnormalities on DTI and ultimate
neurologic/cognitive outcome. The non-invasive
technique of functional MRI can be considered as the
leading technique for functional exploration of the
infant's brain with localisation of functional brain
activation upon sensory, motor and cognitive tasks.
Advanced MRI in the newborn brain has allowed to
study the structural correlate of early brain development
and plasticity in the developing organism.

Background and Aims: Although lesion topography in
MCAI appears crucial regarding outcome, the earlier the
identification of events leading to structural brain
damage the greater the possibility of intervention. To
define the abnormalities of PD in patients with MCAI
and whether altered PD patters could anticipate the
diagnosis.
Methods: Combined cerebral ultrasound (CUS): To
evaluate changes in parenchymal echogenicity and PD
studies and to assess for symmetry of flow and to
measure blood flow velocity (BFV) -.
Results: 29 infants (BW 2.9±0.7 kg, GA 38±3 wk), who
underwent CUS-PD studies as part of routine work up of
patients with seizures (n=21) or risk factors for brain
injury (n=8) had diagnosis of MCAI (65% on 1st CUS;
mean time between symptoms and CUS diagnosis
34±30 hs). PD showed asymmetric flow (decreased or
absent) in 90% of cases (mean time between symptoms
and PD 21±19 hs). Abnormal PD preceded abnormal
CUS (early-APD) in 5 infants (mean time 54±48 hs).
PD showed higher systolic, diastolic and temporal mean
BFV in the non-affected as compared with the affected
side (p<.01). Comparisons between early-APD and the
remaining infants yielded lower systolic BFV and lower
resistance index (p=.048) in the affected side in the
former, but no differences on PD measurements in the
non-affected side between groups.
Conclusions: MCAI is clearly defined by CUS-PD.
Studies performed soon after onset of symptoms could
depict the earliest events evolving into definite structural
damage. Studies are needed to address whether this
could represent a therapeutic window.

Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden
Background and Aims: Cerebral ventriculomegaly at
term age is an important predictor of adverse
neurological outcome in preterms. It is associated to
intraventricular haemorrhages (IVH) and periventricular
leukomalcia (PVL), but is also observed in preterms
without IVH/ PVL and then representing white matter
loss and global cerebral atrophy. 3D MRI provides a
valid assessment of ventricle volumes. To identify risk
factors for the development of ventriculomegaly we
correlated ventricular volumes at term age to perinatal
data in a population based cohort of extremely low
gestational age (ELGA) infants.
Methods: 34 ELGA infants born in the Stockholm
region were included (mean gestational age 25+3 weeks
(SD 9 days); mean birth weight of 773g (SD 162g)).
Infants were scanned at term equivalent age on a 1.5 T
magnetic resonance system. A T1-weighted 3D-Spoiled-
Gradient-Echo Sequence was used to perform
volumetric measurements. Volume of the lateral
ventricles was measured applying a software based on a
semi-automatic Gradient Vector Flow Active Contour
model.
Results: As expected IVH II-IV (p=0.041) and PVL
(p=0.000) but also postnatal steroids (p=0.017) were
identified as risk factors. In the linear regression
analysis gestational age (p=0.033), days on ventilator
(p=0.006) and cumulative dose of postnatal steroids
(p=0.041) correlated to the ventricular volume at term
age.
Conclusions: Ventriculomegaly can be precisely
quantified by 3D MRI. Our study underlines that besides
IVH and PVL, pulmonary morbidity (including its
therapy (respirator, postnatal steroids)) is an important
factor in the pathogenesis of ventriculomegaly at term
age.

Background and Aims: Amplitude-integrated EEG (a-
EEG, CFM) is widely used in NICU’s. We want to
assess the accuracy of a-EEG in both neonatal seizure
detection and classification of background activity.
Methods: 14 Full term neonates with asphyxia had
seizures recorded on multi-channel EEG. Eight-hours-
EEG segments were scored for onset, location,
amplitude and frequency of electrographic seizures by a
neurophysiologist. A-EEG with single-channel EEG
(C3-4) were scored independently at paper speeds of 6
cm/hour and 30 cm/hour for seizures and amplitude of
the background activity by a neurophysiologist and a
neonatologist.
Results: 412 Seizures (mean 29 per patient, range 3-
144) were detected on EEG. At 6 cm/hour and 30 cm/hr,
a-EEG showed a median seizure detection rate of
respectively 66% (mean 53,6 range 0-100) and 72,9%
(58,2, 0-100). The inter-rater agreement was 80%. The
seizures missed by a-EEG were <50 V in amplitude,
involved temporo-occipital or frontal brain regions, or
contained excess of EEG artefacts. In 3 patients all
seizures were missed. Classification of voltage of
background activity by a-EEG was similar in all
patients.
Conclusions: A-EEG detects slightly more than half the
seizures in asphyxiated neonates. Some seizures started
focally but generalized in the next hours resulting in
detection on a-EEG. However, in low-voltage
background activity all seizures were missed, which
make a multi-channel EEG mandatory. A-EEG appeared
to be a reliable tool in assessing the background EEG
activity that can be of considerable help in
prognostication after birth asphyxia.

Background and Aims: Cerebral blood flow (CBF)
alterations are important in the pathogenesis of neonatal
ischemic brain damage. Estimations of CBF changes in
newborns are mostly based on Doppler velocities in the
basilar (BA) and internal carotid (ICA) arteries. Also
with PC-MRA, blood flow can be obtained, but there is
limited experience with this technique in newborns. Aim
is to compare these two methods.
Methods: We compared BA and left/right-ICA’s
velocities obtained by Doppler velocities with two-
dimensional PC-MRA measured velocities in 18
newborns. Two-D-PC slice was positioned at the skull
base level to measure BA and ICA’s volume flow.
Immediately thereafter Doppler measurements of these
blood vessels were performed. Angle-corrected-time-
averaged flow-velocities were measured over 3-5
cardiac cycles.
Results: Newborns varied in gestational age (range 26-
41 wks), weight (range 1470-5858 g) and age (0-103
days). A significant correlation coefficient was found
between PC-MRA and Doppler velocities in BA and
ICA’s (see figure).
Conclusions: Two dimensional PC-MRA showed a
significant positive correlation with Doppler measured
cerebral velocities. This may open new possibilities for
estimations of cerebral blood flow in ill neonates.

Background and Aims: Premature birth has been
related to delayed brain maturation. However, some
studies suggest that the extrauterine environment
stimulates development, and delayed maturation may
therefore be associated with concomitant risk factors,
rather than preterm birth itself. The possibility of more
rapid maturation of certain brain areas has not yet been
demonstrated. 1) To compare brain maturation in a
sample of preterm neonates and a control group, and
2) to test the effect of postnatal age (PNA) in brain
maturation.
Methods: 27 healthy preterm neonates (mean GA 31w)
and 10 full-term newborns (mean GA 39w) were
included. Both groups were MR scanned at term-
equivalent ages. Diffusion weighted EPI images were
acquired on a Siemens Magneton Trio 3T scanner
(b-value 1000 mm2/s, 6 directions). Fractional
anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient
(ADC) images were calculated, and analysed using
VBM technique: images were spatially normalised to a
study specific template, and SPM2 tools were used for
statistical analysis. We compared FA and ADC images
using the two t-test comparison (control > preterm;
preterm > control).
Results: When compared with the full-term group,
preterm infants at term age showed increased FA in
areas related to visual function. The t-test group
comparison between preterm and controls showed FA
- 43 -
increase in the preterm group at the medial temporal
region, level of the sagittal stratum (SS). Correlation
analysis demonstrated a positive relationship between
FA values and PNA in the preterm group in the same
areas. ADC showed no differences.
Conclusions: This VBM approach to FA images
provides new insight into quantification of WM regional
brain maturation. The differences observed in the SS in
preterm infants compared to controls suggest that visual-
related brain areas (i.e. face perception) may be
stimulated by early experience. Our findings lead to new
investigations evaluating adaptive mechanisms of the
developing brain at early stages. Sponsored by Mats

Background and Aims: One characteristic that makes
human brain so unique is its ability at recognizing. Thus
far little is known about neural mechanisms underling
the capacity to discriminate objects/faces in human
infants, mainly because there are few non-invasive
techniques available. In this study we aimed to
investigate, using a non-invasive technique such as near-
infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), cortical activation-related
haemodynamic changes in response to visual
stimulation in 6-month old infants after exposure to a
known and an unknown face.
Methods: Thirteen infants have been monitored. We
have used 3 different types of visual stimuli: a grey
background (GB), the photo of the mother face (MF)
and the photo of an unknown person (UF). These
images have been presented to the child, on a PC screen,
in the following order: GB – MF – GB – UF, keeping
the environment around the child as quite as possible.
Changes in regional oxy [HbO2], deoxy-[HbH] and total
hemoglobin [Hb tot] have been measured by NIRS in
both temporal and occipital areas.
Results: In the temporal area, [Hb tot] increased
following the presentation of both mother’s face
(+129%, P<0.001) and unknown face (+46%, P<0.001).
No significant changes were observed during GB. In the
occipital area, different kinds of pattern have been
observed.
Conclusions: The increase in [Hb tot] observed in the
temporal area suggest haemodynamic and metabolic
changes coupled to cortical activation in response to
face presentation. A non invasive technique such as
NIRS can be used to assess and follow the emergence
and the development of image processing in infants.

Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Centre for
Perinatal Brain Protection and Repair, University
College London, UK
Background and Aims: Infants with neonatal
encephalopathy and experimental hypoxia-ischemia
(HI) models show rebound brain intracellular alkalosis,
this pH shift is known to correlate with
neurodevelopmental outcome. Here we present an
enhancement of neutral red spectrophotometry allowing
regional pH measurements and creation of pseudocolour
pH maps.
Methods: P7 mice underwent left carotid occlusion and
90 minutes hypoxia. Following neutral red injection,
animals were sacrificed and their brains snap frozen.
The cut surface of the brain was captured using a
camera with narrow bandwidth filters. pH was
calculated using the 540nm/470nm absorbance ratios
and a standard curve of brain homogenates at known
pH.
Results: HI resulted in a profound acidosis on the
operated side; the moderate effects seen on the
contralateral side suggests perfusion steal. Reperfusion
resulted in recovery to normal pH followed by an
alkalotic shift at 6 hours (Figure 1).
Conclusions: These techniques can be used to further
study the effects of pH on histopathological outcome
following neonatal HI.

Background and Aims: Several MR techniques are
used to evaluate the degree of injury after hypoxic-
- 44 -
ischemic insults in the newborn infant. Studies using
single-voxel based techniques to obtain MR spectra
have shown a good correlation between metabolic
alterations and outcome. Objective: To develop and
evaluate a multiple-voxel based MR-spectroscopy
method and correlating metabolic information to the
pattern of injury on conventional MRI and outcome.
Methods: Ten full term infants with severe birth
asphyxia were included, (mean bw 3382 g, Sarnat score
I=(1), II=(8), III=(1)). MRI examination on a 1.5 T MRI
system was done at a median age of 7 days. MR-
spectroscopic imaging was used for each patient 2D-
MRS images were produced for choline, creatine, Naa,
lactate and corresponding ratios using two different echo
times, TE=136ms, TE=272ms, MRSI voxel volume 0.6-
1.1 cm3. A bicubic interpolation was done of the 24x24
pixel images to 256x256 pixel metabolite images with
the anatomical contour superimposed. MR images were
scored by three independent observers using a
predefined scoring system (Barkovich) defining the
pattern of injury; Watershed, Basalganglia/Thalamus
predominant or normal. MRS injury pattern were
scored.
Results: MRI pattern (WS=6 BG=4 N=0) MRSI pattern
(WS=6 BG=4). In 3 infants with normal outcome the
scorings from MRI and MRSI lactate and
lactate/Choline were congruent. (WS=2 BG=1)
Additional information about severity and the extent of
the affected areas were obtained in all infants with
neurological sequelae (n=7).
Conclusions: Metabolic mapping using MRSI is
possible and gives additional valuable clinical
information on brain dammage after birth asphyxia.
3D ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY IN CONGENITAL
HEART DISEASES
P Acar
Department of Paediatric Cardiology, Hôpital des
Enfants, Toulouse, France
Background and Aims: The introduction of real time
three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography has led to its
use in everyday clinical practice.
Methods: The 3D matrix probe enables the
instantaneous acquisition of transthoracic volumes.
Several modes of 3D are available: 3D volume, biplan
and 3D color Doppler.
Results: Real time 3D echocardiography gave a more
accurate description of various congenital heart diseases
as well as valvulopathy, shunt and aorta pathology. Fetal
3D echocardiography is available. Quantitative
measurement of ventricular volumes could be obtained
by 3D echocardiography.
Conclusion: The facility of utilisation of the matrix
probe should lead to routine usage of 3D
echocardiography as with 2D and Doppler method. Its
values should be decisive in many congenital cardiac
lesions requiring surgery or interventional
catheterisation.

Background and Aims: To review the effect of
fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO) at
26-29 w on fetuses with severe congenital
diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and define a strategy for
future clinical trials.
Methods: Eligibility for FETO was single fetus with
severe CDH (lung-to-head ratio (LHR)<1 and
intrathoracic liver) without associated problems. FETO
was at 26-29 wks gestational age (GA). Outcome
measure was postnatal pulmonary outcome i.e. survival
without, or death due to pulmonary hypoplasia and/or
hypertension.
Results: 43 left and 10 right-sided CDH cases had a
median LHR=0.7 prior to FETO (range: 0.5-0.9).
Median operation time of 10 min (range: 3-60).
Amniorrhexis occurred in 26% at <32 wks, in the last
half it was 16%. Median GA at delivery was 35 wks
(range 27-41). Airway patency was restored either
perinatally (n=18) or antenatally at 34 wks (n=35). Early
neonatal survival resp. at discharge were 60% (32/53)
and 51% (27/53). Regression analysis showed that LHR
prior to FETO is predicting survival, increasing from
13% for LHR<0.6 (n=8) to 52% for LHR of
0.6 LHR<0.8 (n=25) and 65% for 0.8 LHR<1 (n=20).
Learning curve is suggested by improving PPROM rates
and higher GA at delivery.
Conclusions: Survival after FETO is dependent on
preoperative LHR and we suggest to report results
likewise. When LHR<0.6 survival rate is 13%, therefore
pulmonary response to very early FETO (<24w) should
be studied. Survival in fetuses with CDH and
0.6 LHR<1.0 is 58%, and in the more common left
sided group, we suggest randomisation against optimal
postnatal care.

Background and Aims: Several studies have been
undertaken on resuscitation with 100% oxygen versus
room air. It has been shown that resuscitation with
100% oxygen has detrimental effects. We wish to
investigate the effects of resuscitation with 100%
oxygen on cerebral damage after hypoxic/ischemic
injury compared to room air.
Methods: Two groups of newborn piglets (12-36 hours)
were studied. They were randomized to either hypoxia
or normoxia. The hypoxic group was randomized to be
resuscitated with either 100% or 21% oxygen. Global
hypoxia was induced by ventilation with 8% oxygen in
N2 until Base Excess < - 20 mmol/L or mean arterial
blood pressure = 15 mmHg. After hypoxia the animals
were observed for 150 min and then euthanized, the
brains removed and the left hemisphere and cerebellum
fixated in 10% buffered formalin. They were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and
immunhistochemistry performed with anti-
Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) antibodies,
MAP-2 being a sensitive marker for ischemic cerebral
damage. The HE-stainings and the immunhisto-
chemistry were evaluated, blinded, by a pathologist.
Results: The sections from cerebellum presented
increased numbers of necrotic purkinjecells in the 100%
oxygen group (75%), compared to the 21% group
(50%). Preliminary data from striatum present
significantly more damage in the 100% group.
Conclusions: 100% oxygen appears to cause increased
necrosis in cerebellum and striatum in newborn piglets.

Background and Aims: Interventions of
“developmental care” are becoming popular in neonatal
units to reduce infants’ distress and promote well-being.
This study, supported by the European Science
Foundation, estimates the frequency and patterns of
implementation in different European countries.
Methods: 279 neonatal units (response rate 78%) in
eight countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy,
Netherlands, UK, Spain and Sweden) answered a
structured questionnaire. Over 2/3 of units were 3rd
level; median number of yearly <1500 gr. admissions
was 57 (from 23 in Sweden to 154 in Netherlands).
Results: Control of lighting was more prevalent than
noise control (moderate lighting 24h in 59% of Units;
quiet times during the day in 40%). Most units used
nesting (73 to 100%), regular variation of infant’s
position (54 to 86%), and pacifier for comfort (69 to
100%). Strategies of pain management included written
guidelines in 58% of units (44% in Italy to 86% in
Netherlands) and a reference person in 48% (15% in
Italy to over 85% in Netherlands and Sweden). Parents
were allowed to visit around the clock in 63% of units
(1/3 in Italy and Spain to 100% in Denmark and
Sweden), and were offered “Kangaroo care” in 74%
(from 35% in Spain to 100% in Sweden and
Netherlands). Formal programs such as Neonatal Infant
Developmental Care and Assessment Program
(NIDCAP) were mostly applied in Denmark, Sweden
and Belgium.
Conclusions: Most units routinely apply measures of
developmental care; such measures, however, are most
often and consistently applied in Sweden and Denmark,
and less often in Italy and Spain.

Background and Aims: Monochorionic (MC)
pregnancies complicated by twin-to-twin transfusion
syndrome (TTTS) are at increased risk for prematurity
as well as perinatal mortality and morbidity. Although
perinatal outcome in TTTS has improved after laser
therapy, neonatal mortality and morbidity remain high.
The respective role of prematurity and of fatal disease
are ill-defined. The objective of this study was to
compare neonatal outcomes between TTTS infants and
dichorionic (DC) twins, and to evaluate the impact of
laser therapy.
Methods: This was a case-control retrospective study
carried out at our center between 2000-2005. Neonatal
outcome was assessed in 97 TTTS infants treated in
utero with laser (n=56 pregnancies). Control group
consisted of 97 DC twins (56 DC pregnancies) delivered
between 24-34 weeks of gestation and matched for
gestational age at birth with the cases.
Results: Gestational age at delivery was similar in both
groups (median=30;0, IQR 28-34wks), as well as birth
weight. Neonatal outcome in TTTS infants was not
significantly different from those of DC infants:
mortality (11.3% vs 12.3%), severe cerebral lesions
(17.9% vs 12.9%). The incidence of adverse neonatal
outcome (death or severe cerebral lesion) was not
different within groups (21% vs 18%). Logistic
regression analysis demonstrated that gestational age
- 46 -
was the only significant factor associated with adverse
neonatal outcome; IUGR, intrauterine death and
chorionicity failed to show any significant effect.
Conclusions: Neonatal mortality and morbidity rates of
TTTS infants treated by laser were not different from
those of DC infants matched for gestational age.
Neonatal outcome was strongly related to prematurity.

Medical Center, Sophia Childrens Hospital, Rotterdam,

Background and Aims: In a previous, randomised
controlled trial of enteral glutamine supplementation in
very low birth weight (VLBW) infants the incidence of
infectious morbidity was decreased in the glutamine-
supplemented group. We hypothesize that glutamine-
enriched enteral nutrition in the neonatal period may
have consequences for the immune response to micro-
organisms and allergic antigens later in life and the
incidence of allergic and infectious disease.
Methods: The parents of 89/102 surviving infants who
participated in the initial study (13 infants died) were
asked to complete a questionnaire on infectious and
allergic disease during the first year of life. The
questionnaire was adapted from two validated
questionnaires, used in the PIAMA Study and the
Generation R Study respectively. Logistic regression
was used for data analysis. Corrections were made for
possible confounding factors, as smoking at home,
childcare attendance, siblings, infection during neonatal
period and parental allergic disease.
Results: 77/89 (86%) questionnaires were completed.
The mean corrected age of the infants was 54.8±5
weeks. There was less atopic dermatitis in the
glutamine-supplemented group (5 versus 20%) was
found: Odds ratio (OR) 0.13 (95% CI 0.02-0.96;
P=0.05), and a trend towards less bronchial
hyperreactivity OR 0.36, (95%CI 0.1-1.25; P=0.11). The
incidence of infections in the first year of life was not
different in the glutamine-supplemented and control
group.
Conclusions: Glutamine-enriched enteral nutrition in
VLBW infants in the neonatal period may contribute to
less allergic disease in the first year of life. Glutamine-
enriched enteral nutrition had no effect on the incidence
of infectious disease during the first year of life.

C Vanhole, H Devlieger, P Casaer
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital UZ
Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium
Background and Aims: The cerebral TOI (tissue
oxygenation index) reflects the cerebral oxygenation. In
this study we analyzed the effect of changes in
glycaemia on the TOI, as measured by NIRS, in
neonates.
Methods: Inclusion criteria were postmenstrual age less
than 32 weeks and weight less than 1500 grams. In all
patients at least 4 hours of continuous monitoring of
TOI with NIRS (NIRO 300, Hamamatsu), glycaemia
(Medtronic MiniMed CGMS System Gold), mean
arterial blood pressure (MABP), saturation and if
possible also tPCO2 was performed during the first days
of life. The means of TOI, glycaemia, tPCO2 and
MABP were calculated. Multiple regression analysis
was performed correcting for saturation, MABP and if
possible tPCO2.
Results: 50 Measurements in 15 infants are analysed. In
a subgroup of 16 measurements, also the tPCO2 was
continuously monitored. In 29 of the 50 measurements
(58%), a significant positive correlation was found
between the TOI and glycaemia after correction for
saturation and MABP. In the subgroup additional
correction for tPCO2 influenced the level of significance
in only 3 of the 16 measurements. None of the patients
suffered from severe hypoglycaemia.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that changes in
glycaemia within the normal ranges and even after
correction for MABP, saturation and tPCO2, had a
direct effect on the cerebral oxygenation in neonates
during the first days of life. In studies regarding cerebral
oxygenation, glycaemia levels should be included.

Background and Aims: To study the effect of
pregnancy complications leading to preterm birth on
outcome of very preterm infants.
Methods: A cohort of NICU admitted infants < 32
weeks, born in 2003-2004 in 6 Italian regions (ACTION
study) was prospectively studied. Pregnancy
complications and cause of preterm birth were grouped
as follows: preterm labour (PTL: including prelabour
rupture of membranes, infection); hypertensive
disorders (HD: hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia,
HELLP); Intra Uterine Growth Restriction (IUGR);
placental haemorrhage; malformations. Outcomes were
in-hospital mortality, and ultrasound-diagnosed white
matter damage (WMD: periventricular leucomalacia
- 47 -
and/or severe intraventricular haemorrhage) among
survivors.
Results: 2953 infants (mean birthweight 1158 g, mean
GA 28+3) were analysed; in-hospital mortality was
17.4%; WMD in survivors was 8.3%. PTL frequency
was 52.1%, HD 20.9%, IUGR 14.2%, haemorrhage
9.9%; malformations 1.6%. PTL was more frequent in
extremely preterms (22-27 weeks), while HD in
intermediate preterm (28-31): GA differences could
confound the association with outcome. In a
multivariate logistic model, after controlling for GA and
others factors influencing outcome (antenatal steroids,
sex, illness severity (CRIB), twin birth, cesarean section,
region), malformations and IUGR were independent risk
factors for mortality (OR=12.0, 95%CI 5.7-25.2, and
1.6, CI 1.1-2.5 respectively), while HD tended to be
protective (OR=0.68, CI 0.45-1.02). Using the same
model, HD was protective against WMD in survivors
(OR=0.55, CI 0.32-0.95).
Conclusions: Different pregnancy complications and
the cause of preterm delivery were differently associated
with mortality and WMD. This points to different
pathways leading to preterm birth and subsequent
damage. Overall, HD seems to be protective against
adverse outcomes in very preterm infants.
NEW DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES IN
RESPIRATORY MEDICINE BEYOND LUNG
FUNCTION: INVESTIGATION AND
MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA
E Baraldi
Department of Paediatrics, University of Padova, Italy
The inflammatory state of asthmatic airways may
correlate weakly with clinical symptoms and lung
function parameters, and that is why the development of
non-invasive methods for inflammatory monitoring is
very important in asthma. Exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)
measurement FENO has been studied extensively,
validated as a non-invasive marker of eosinophilic
airway inflammation in asthma, and standardized for use
in clinical practice. Guidelines for standardized FENO
measurement have been published jointly by ATS and
ERS and normal reference values with the
recommended technique are available for children 4-17
years old. The single breath online method (SBOL) is
the gold standard for FENO measurement in cooperating
children. The child inhales NO-free air to near-total lung
capacity, and then exhales at a constant flow of 50
ml/sec for at least 4 seconds. On-line FENO
measurement during spontaneous breathing has been
applied in children aged 2-5 years old, with the
exhalation flow manually adjusted to 50 ml/sec by
changing the exhalation resistance. The method is not
well standardized, however, and still requires some
passive co-operation. FENO may have a role as a
diagnostic tool. Avital et al. showed that FENO can
differentiate asthmatic young children from non-
asthmatic cases with chronic cough. In addition, in
children with recurrent wheezing, raised FENO values
may be useful in identifying patients most likely to
respond to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). FENO
measurement is also useful in asthma follow-up. In
children, FENO levels have been demonstrated to
predict asthma relapse after discontinuing steroids and
to predict the failure of attempts to reduce ICS dosages.
Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) Exhaled breath
condensate, obtained by cooling exhaled air, contains
water vapor and micro-droplets, the composition of
which is believed to reflect that of the airway lining
fluid. EBC collection is totally non-invasive and easy to
perform even in children. Recommendations have been
recently published on how to collect EBC. The
drawbacks of EBC analysis lie in that the concentrations
of mediators in EBC are low, the anatomical sources of
the compounds measured in EBC are not well defined
and most of the measurements are not done in real time.
A large number of mediators have been measured in
EBC. Markers of oxidative stress- as hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2), isoprostanes, aldehydes and nitrotyrosine- are
increased in asthmatic subjects, while glutathione (a
protective lung antioxidant) is reduced. Beside,
inflammatory metabolites, such as cysteinyl leukotrienes
(Cys-LTs), have been found increased in allergic
asthmatic children, despite corticosteroid treatment.
Also, a reduced EBC pH has been reported in asthmatic
children, suggesting that a dysregulation in airway pH
homeostasis may have a role in asthma pathogenesis.
Conclusion Exhaled nitric oxide has been established as
a marker of eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthma
and recent studies have included FENO measurement in
treatment algorithms. Exhaled breath condensate is a
non-invasive technique for sampling the airways, which
has the potential to offer new insight on lung disease
pathobiology.
IMPACT OF CHANGING PRACTICE WITH THE
USE OF CPAP
T del Moral, N Claure, S Vanbuskirk, E Bancalari
Department of Pediatrics, University of Miami, FL, USA
Background and Aims: Early Continuous Positive
Airway Pressure may reduce lung damage by decreasing
the need for mechanical ventilation and it is increasingly
used as an alternative strategy for ELBW infants with
RDS. The objective of this study was to evaluate
changes in the use of CPAP and the impact of these
changes on the use of surfactant, mechanical ventilation,
oxygen therapy and incidence of BPD.
Methods: The study included 606 neonates with BW
between 500-1000g born at the University of
Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital during two periods
of time (1998 to 2000 and 2002 to 2004). Outcome
variables were compared between the two periods by 2.
All differences reported were statistically significant
(p<0.05).
Results: During the second time period there was an
increased proportion of infants never intubated (5% vs
15%), decrease use of surfactant (66% vs 58%), and a
decreased mechanical ventilation use (intubated at 24
hours 84% vs 71%) and duration (intubated at 7 days
66% vs 51%). These changes were not accompanied by
a lower incidence of BPD. In fact, during the later
period a larger proportion of infants required oxygen
early during their course (O2>21% at 7 days 39% vs
- 48 -
48%) and the incidence of BPD was higher (29% vs
39%).
Conclusions: The reduced use and duration of
mechanical ventilation was not associated with
improved respiratory outcome. The increased use of
supplemental O2 in infants with non-invasive
respiratory support could explain the higher incidence of
BPD in the second time period.
ADDITIVE EFFECTS OF KL4 AND POLYMERS
FOR PREVENTION OF SURFACTANT
INHIBITION
K W Lu, H W Taeusch
Department of Pediatrics, University of California San
Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA, USA
Background and Aims: Inactivation of pulmonary
surfactant is caused by acute lung injuries and interferes
with the effectiveness of surfactant replacement therapy
in these diseases. Surfactant proteins, such as SP-B, and
various ionic and nonionic polymers, such as
hyaluronan (HA) or polyethylene glycol (PEG), can
reduce inhibition of adsorption caused by serum. Our
aim was to understand the interaction between an SP-B
analogue and polymers in preventing serum inhibition of
surfactant.
Methods: We used currently available surfactants,
surfactant lipids, or surfactant lipids with either 0.4 or
0.8 mg/mL of KL4, a synthetic analogue of SP-B
(Discovery Laboratories, Inc, USA). Mixtures (1.25
mg/mL) were studied in a pulsating bubble
surfactometer that measures surface activity. HA 250
kDa, 0.25% w/v, or PEG 10 kDa, 5% w/v, were added
to some mixtures.
Results: As shown in the table, KL4-surfactant 0.8
mg/mL (shaded row) required at least twice the amount
of serum to inhibit activity compared with lipids alone,
KL4-surfactant 0.4 mg/mL, and versus historical data
with beractant, calfactant, or poractant alfa (Lu et al.
Pediatr Res. 2005;57:237).
Conclusions: Adding KL4 to surfactant lipids reduces
serum inhibition in a concentration-dependent manner.
Effects of PEG or HA are most evident in the presence
of either concentration of KL4. These results indicate
additive effects of KL4 and polymers in reducing serum
inhibition. Supported by Discovery Labs.

Gardens Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa
Background and Aims: Nasal CPAP (nCPAP) is
currently used after extubation from mechanical
ventilation. There is, however, uncertainty regarding the
best approach to nCPAP weaning. Objective: To
compare the effectiveness of pressure reduction with
alternating periods of nCPAP with nasal cannula low
flow oxygen ('time off') in weaning very low
birthweight (VLBW) infants from nCPAP.
Methods: Infants <1500g, and stable in <0.3 FIO2 on
nCPAP were randomised to a weaning strategy of either
gradual reduction of nCPAP 'pressure', or increasing
duration of 'time off' nCPAP. Infants were considered
successfully weaned if stable off nCPAP for 7 days.
Results: Median (range) birth weights and gestations
were: 'pressure' group, 940g (614 - 1400g) and 27 (24 -
32) wks; 'time off' group, 1080g (520 - 1496g) and 28
(24 - 31) wks. Median PMA at randomisation 29
(28 - 31) wks for both groups. Of 112 eligible infants,
36 (65%) in the 'pressure' and 21 (37%) in the 'time off'
arms successfully weaned (p=0.006) [95% CI 0.10 -
0.46]. Infants allocated to 'pressure' arm weaned faster
and spent fewer days on nCPAP. Median (range)
duration of weaning via pressure reduction was 1.5 (0.9
- 50.5) days vs. 8.9 (9.0 - 33.3) days in the 'time off'
group. (p= <0.001) Median total time spent on NCPAP
was proportionately shorter in the ' pressure' group [6.0
(2.1 - 60.0) days vs. 13.2 (10.0 - 46.0)] (p= 0.001).
Conclusions: For VLBW infants, gradual reduction in
nCPAP pressure may facilitate more rapid respiratory
weaning compared with periods of increasing time spent
off nCPAP.

Hospital, Gillingham, Kent, UK
Background and Aims: During weaning process from
Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (NCPAP) in
preterm infants, it is unclear whether weaning by
pressure or time of CPAP is more effective. There are
no published data available comparing the two methods.
Methods: A prospective study was designed to compare
the effects of the two different types of weaning, using
infant flow driver. Preterm infants (gestation 24-31
weeks) with respiratory distress syndrome or immature
lungs were randomly allocated to Time weaning or
Pressure weaning and weaned over 6 days. The data
were analysed according to stratification depending on
the gestational age.
Results: 98 Infants (24-27 weeks, n=44 and 28-31
weeks, n=54) were randomised to Pressure (n=49) and
Time (n=49) weaning. In the 24-27 weeks group, 18
(82%) in the pressure arm and 12 (55%) in the time arm
were weaned successfully (p <0.05). Total CPAP days
were 10 and 15 respectively (p <0.05). At 0, 1 and 6
day, there were no differences in the pH, PCO2, FiO2;
number of apnoeas and bradycardias or feeding
tolerance between the two arms. There was a trend of
less hospital days and less oxygen dependency at 36
weeks in the pressure arm. In the 28-31 weeks gestation
group all infants except one in the time arm were
- 49 -
weaned successfully and there was no difference in the
other outcome data.
Conclusions: In infants of gestation 28 weeks onwards,
NCPAP weaning can be successful by either method;
however, in infants of 24-27 weeks gestation pressure
weaning may prove to be more appropriate.

Background and Aims: Chorioamnionitis is frequently
associated with preterm birth and inflammation in fetal
lungs. The fetal lung is immune naive and blood derived
monocytes differentiate into alveolar macrophages
expressing transcription factor PU.1 late in gestation.
Fetal inflammatory responses are minimal to tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in sheep. We hypothesized
that chorioamnionitis induced maturational changes in
the monocytes of the fetal lung.
Methods: Time-mated ewes with singletons received
10mg endotoxin or saline by intra-amniotic injection 2d
or 7d before delivery at 124d gestational age (n=7 per
group, term 150d). Monocytes/macrophages were
isolated with Percoll gradient from the right lung.
Monocytes/macrophages were analyzed and cultured
with recombinant ovine TNF-alpha (50ng/ml,
endotoxin-free).
Results: Macrophages were identified by size and
MHCII expression with 98±12 mean fluorescent units in
controls and 305±41 after 7d. The percentage of
macrophages increased to 90±4% after 7d versus 12±7%
in controls (p<0.05). Macrophages isolated after 2d of
chorioamnionitis produced 28±5μmol hydrogen
peroxide/106 macrophages and 97±13μmol/106 after 7d
when stimulated with TNF-alpha (p<0.05 vs same cells
with media only and controls (11±5μmol/106) which
did not respond to TNF-alpha. Few alveolar
macrophages from controls were positive for PU.1
(8±3%) but 55±10% after 7d (p<0.05).
Conclusions: Pulmonary inflammation recruited
monocytes into the fetal lung which differentiated into
macrophages by expressing PU.1. In vitro responses to
TNF-alpha were induced within 2d of chorioamnionitis.
Chorioamnionitis modulates the function of fetal lung
monocytes consistent with maturation which may affect
subsequent immune responses after preterm birth.

Background and Aims: Effective airway passage of
aerosols in respiratory therapy of neonates is crucial for
a positive outcome. Therefore, devices aimed at
delivering aerosols to the lungs such as inhalers and
nebulisers must be studied thoroughly. For this purpose
we constructed an anatomically correct model of the
upper airways in a 32 weeks gestational age premature
infant. This study describes the construction process,
validation and characterization of this airway model.
Methods: Three-dimensional reconstruction of a three-
planar MRI scan was done using Magics© software
(Materialise™, Munich, Germany) followed by
selection of an optimal air-mucosa threshold. Model
reconstruction was achieved using the generated data
and Selective Laser Sintering Technique. Subsequently,
validation was realized between the original data and a
CT scan of our model by comparison of airway volume
and anatomical reference points.
Results: The construction process proved to have a high
accuracy. The airway volumes of the initial MRI and the
control CT scan showed to be 1277mm3 and 1265mm3,
respectively. The final relative deviation in volume was
0.94 percent.
Conclusions: We constructed an anatomically correct
model of the upper airways of a 32 week-old premature
infant with high accuracy. This model is suitable for
further in vitro measurements such as lung dose
measurements of aerosols.

Background and Aims: Accuracy of QTD FEM, a
relatively non-invasive method applicable in a clinical
setting, to monitor cardiovascular parameters has not yet
been described during TLV. This study evaluates
cardiovascular influence of TLV using QTD FEM in a
controlled animal experimental trial.
Methods: 16 anesthetised-paralysed healthy newborn-
lambs instrumented for monitoring of: 1-Pulmonary
artery (PAP), central venous pressure (CVP) via Swan-
Ganz catheter; 2-Cardiac index (CI), arterial blood
pressure (AP), indexed stroke volume (SVI), systemic
vascular resistance (SVRI), intra-thoracic blood-volume
(ITBI), extra-vascular lung-water (EVLWI) using QTD
fem (PC-8000-PICCO-monitor, Pulsion-Medical-
- 50 -
System, Ge). Following baseline recording, animals
were divided in 2 groups: GV=8, who remained GV at:
Fr=40/min, PiP=15cm. H2O, Peep=5cm.H2O,
FiO2=1.0; TLV=8, whose lungs were filled with
30ml/kg PFOB (F2-chemicals, UK) and then ventilated
with volume-controlled-pressure-limited liquid
ventilator at Fr=3-4/min, Vt=25ml/kg, I/E=1:3,
FiO=1.0. Gas exchanges, Lactate/Pyruvate ratio (L/P)
and cardiovascular parameters were recorded at 30 min
intervals during a 120 min period.
Results: As compared to GV group overall and to
baseline GV, TLV animals demonstrated an increase in
PaCO2, and a decrease in PaO2, but gas exchanges were
maintained in the targeted range. A decrease in pHa was
also observed, with no difference in L/P however. AP
was decreased but maintained in the targeted range.
There was no change in PAP or CVP. CI, SVI and ITBI
were increased, and SVRI was decreased. Moreover, a
30ml/kg increase in EVLWI was demonstrated.
Conclusions: Due to the high thermal conductibility of
PFOB, accuracy of QTD FEM during TLV is
questionable. Nonetheless, this method could be
considered to monitor liquid FRC during TLV.

Background and Aims: Continuous positive airways
pressure (CPAP) is an established technique for
managing acute respiratory failure. Helium-oxygen gas
mixtures (heliox), due to its physical properties, may
enhance the physiological benefits of CPAP if used as
the driving gas. The aim of this study was to assess if
heliox can be safely and effectively used as the driving
gas through an infant flow driver, one of the commonest
CPAP devices in paediatrics.
Methods: The ASL5000 Servo Lung simulator was
used to compare heliox/oxygen mixtures versus
air/oxygen mixtures as the driving gases of the infant
flow driver. Studies were undertaken at 4 different
CPAP settings across varying tidal volumes and
respiratory rates. In each case pressure, flow and volume
changes were measured by the lung simulator. Blender
accuracy was noted as well as noise emission.
Results: 1) Up to 6 cmH20 CPAP pressure was
achievable using heliox. 2) The work of breathing
(WOB) was reduced by up to 60% when using heliox.
3) Maximum gas blender discrepancy using heliox was
10%. 4) CPAP pressure recorded was accurate at all
flow rates up to 15L/min. 5) Noise emission when using
heliox is no more than 1.3 dB greater than with
conventional gases. 6) Heliox-CPAP consumes greater
quantities of gas at all CPAP pressure settings.
Conclusions: Heliox/oxygen gas mixtures can be
effectively used to deliver CPAP by the Infant Flow
Driver. We recommend the following guidelines:
1) Titrate FiO2 administration using the LCD display.
2) Titrate CPAP pressure based on the actual CPAP
pressure displayed.

Background and Aims: Little research has been
conducted in developing countries concerning the
psychological wellbeing of HIV+ve children. This study
aims to investigate the psychological impact of
disclosure of HIV status in Zambian adolescents.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey of HIV+ve Zambian
adolescents, 11-15 years, recruited from the Lusaka
region. Mental health was rated using the youth-report
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQY).
Carers completed the parent version of the SDQ. Audio-
taped semi-structured interviews were conducted.
Transcriptions were subjected to content analysis to
determine participants’ willingness to engage in a peer
support programme.
Results: Participants had high rates of mental health
problems and were more likely to score in the abnormal
range of the SDQY compared to UK norms (OR 2.1, CI
1.4-3.1), with particular difficulties in relation to peer
problems (OR 7.1, CI 4.9, 10.2). The majority of
participants (58.3%) were unaware of their HIV status.
Most (73%) were receiving antiretroviral therapy and
treatment was associated with increased rates of
disclosure (p<0.01). Only 42.5% of children identified
themselves as having a health problem and they had
higher total SDQY scores (p=0.04). ANOVA with
SDQY total scores as the dependent variable found a
main effect of health (p=0.05), but no effect of
disclosure. The covariate age was significant (p=0.03),
with older children having fewer psychological
problems. Three children said they would not wish to
participate in a peer support programme, but 65% gave
clearly positive responses.
Conclusions: Awareness of positive HIV status was not
associated with poorer mental health and disclosure
could facilitate provision of peer support.

Background and Aims: Lenticulostriate vasculopathy
(LSV) (branched echodensities in basal ganglia) has
been frequently reported in newborns with different
- 51 -
disorders. We assessed how often LSV present at term
age was due to postnatally acquired CMV infection.
Methods: All infants <32 weeks of gestation born
between April 2003 and December 2006 and treated in
our NICU were studied. Cranial ultrasonography (CUS)
was performed several times during the first week after
birth and once a week till discharge. The first follow-up
visit at term included CUS. In infants with LSV at term
CMV culture or CMV PCR in urine was performed.
Congenital infection was excluded by a negative CMV
PCR or CMV IgM on the Guthrie card. Birth weight and
gestational age of infants with CMV infection and
without CMV infection were statistically analysed.
Results: Nineteen (4%) of a total of 475 infants <32
weeks assessed at term on follow-up visit developed
LSV. LSV was not seen during the first weeks after
birth but was present at term age. In 5 (26%) infants the
diagnosis of postnatally acquired CMV infection was
confirmed. Infants with CMV infection were younger
and smaller than infants without infection but there was
no statistical difference found (27 wks and 29 wks,
respectively, p=0.35, 950g and 1200g, respectively,
p=0.08). All CMV positive infants had received breast
milk.
Conclusions: LSV can develop weeks after birth in
small preterm infants and can be diagnosed by CUS at
term. In infants receiving breast milk and developing
LSV weeks after birth, postnatally acquired CMV
infection should be investigated.

Background and Aims: Orbital Cellulitis is a potential
serious condition in children. This study is to evaluate
its epidemiology, causative organism, clinical
presentations, and effectiveness of treatments.
Methods: A retrospective review of all children
admitted with diagnosis of Orbital Cellulitis between
1996 to 2004 at University Hospital of Coventry and
Warwickshire.
Results: During this period, 17 cases of Orbital
Cellulitis were analysed. Of these 11 were, males and 6
were females. All patients were documented as had Hib
immunisation. Age of patients ranged from 10 months to
13 years. Out of 17, 11 had restriction of eye movement
4 had altered vision, 4 had proptosis and 3 had
Chemosis. Out of 17 blood, eye swab and nose swab
cultures obtained in 13 patients and results described in
table 1. All patients were treated with antibiotic
combinations described in table 2. All patients were
cured without any complications and sequelae.
Conclusions: With present era of antibiotics, Orbital
Cellulitis can be treated completely without any
sequelae. After the introduction of Hib vaccine, H
influenza is no longer a significant pathogen in orbital
cellulitis.

WBC count.
Methods: Eighty-two children admitted because of
suspected AA classified into two groups: Group 1 (49
children who underwent surgery for AA); and group 2
(33 children with no surgery with diagnosis of non-
specific abdominal pain or sonographic mesenteric
lymphadenitis). WBC count and serum CRP, IL-6 and
LBP were measured on admission.
Results: The results are shown in the table. Optimum
diagnostic cutoff value, area under the ROC curve
(AUC), sensitivity, specificity and positive (PPV) and
negative (NPV) predictive values (percentages) of WBC
count, CRP, IL-6, and LBP for AA.
Conclusions: Only IL-6 showed medium, while other
laboratory markers low diagnostic accuracy for AA in
children. The new laboratory markers, therefore, do not
significantly improve the diagnosis of AA.

Background and Aims: Adolescents comprise a
separate pediatric group with special needs. Aim of the
study was to determine basic knowledge of the risks of
sex and sexual attitudes among Greek adolescents
Methods: 413 adolescents (159 boys and 216 girls),
answered a specific questionnaire. Data analysis was
made with SPSS 8.0.
Results: Knowledge of the risks of sex declared having
87% of the boys and 84% of the girls. 91% of the boys
and 92% of the girls stated that they knew how to
protect themselves. The main sources of knowledge
were reported to be: friends (boys 50%, girls 57%),
parents (boys 32%, girls 14%), media (boys 17%, girls
9%), books (boys 7%, girls 10%), school (boys 4%, girls
12%). Sexually active were 47% of the boys and 31% of
the girls, but of them only 63% of the boys and 74% of
the girls reported using any form of protection. Boys
used exclusively condom, while 70% of the girls used
condom, 8% pill and 10% a combination of both. Only
one unwanted pregnancy was reported, and no sexually
transmitted diseases……!
Conclusions: Approximately half of the boys and one
third of the girls under 18 years reported been sexually
active. Despite the fact that they reported knowledge of
the risks, a significant percentage (37% boys and 26%
girls) practiced no form of protection and near zero
consequences (one wanders). It is evident that an even
more intense and systematic form of information to this
group of young people is desperately required.

Background and Aims: To find out the number of
children who suffered abuse and any signs leading to
identification of non- accidental injury (NAI).
Methods: The case notes of children aged less than 3
years with fractured skull between January 1995 and
December 2004 were evaluated. Several variables,
including age, sex, clinical presentation, mechanism of
injury, fracture type and site, height of fall, and claimed
aetiology associated with injury, were recorded.
Results: A total of 36 children (64% boys 36% girls)
were identified. Twenty three (64%) children were less
than 1 year old. 53% sustained injury from less than one
meter height. 64% had parietal skull fracture and the
other 36% had either occipital, frontal and or mixed
fractures. 61% suffered accidental injury, 22%
suspected of NAI and 17% were proven to have suffered
NAI. 70% occured after drop from carrier's arms or fall
from a height. 36% had head scan and 3 children had
sub/extradural haematoma. Eleven children (31%) had
Skeletal survey and only one was abnormal.
Conclusions: Children and mostly boys who are less
than 1 year old and fall from less than one meter height,
with parietal or mixed fractures, were likely or proven to
have sustained injury from abuse. The two way
communication between health care professionals and
social services has resulted in more cases of child abuse
been identified.

Background and Aims: In the Netherlands children
with Down syndrome (DS) are registered as a part of the
DPSU (Dutch Paediatric Surveillance Unit) since 2003.
The aim of this registration was to enclose the exact data
of incidence at birth, duration and complications of
pregnancy, the clinical symptoms prompting the
diagnoses and associated infant morbidity and mortality.
Methods: Dutch paediatricians have reported newly
diagnosed live born children with DS to the DPSU from
January 1st - December 31st 2003. A questionnaire
collecting demographic and medical data was completed
and was compared to the normal population.
Results: All children with trisomy 21 (182) were
analysed; translocations (7) and mozaicism (3) were
excluded. The prevalence of DS in the Netherlands in
2003 was 16 per 10.000 live born babies (total
prevalence DS, live and stillborn, was 26.8 per 10.000
births). Median age at diagnosis was 1.8 and 10.2 days
in hospital vs home born children. Neonatal and infant
mortality were 1.65% and 4%, respectively.
Characteristics of Down syndrome children vs the
population were: mother's age (33.6 vs 31 yrs),
gestational age (38 vs 39 wks), breast-feeding (51% vs.
78%)*, birth weight ( 3119 vs 3525 gr; 2901 vs 3389
gr)*. (*p<0.05).
Conclusions: This study highlights the characteristics of
DS in the Netherlands. The DS prevalence in the
Netherlands was high. Mortality is higher than in
controls but lower than studies on DS in the recent
literature. This finding underscores the necessity of
assessment of long term morbidity.

Background and Aims: Weight controlling behaviour
was compared in Finnish and Greek adolescents by
gender, weight status and correctness of their opinion of
weight.
Methods: The data comprises Northern Finland 1985/6
birth cohort at age 15-16 and Greek 1983 birth cohort at
age 18. The populations were followed up in 2001 using
similar methods. Self-reported BMI was classified using
IOTF cut-off points. Those who saw themselves more
overweight than they were, were classified to
“overestimated opinion” class, those less to
“underestimated” and the rest to “realistic”. Weight
controlling methods including dieting/fasting, heavy
exercise, vomiting and medication were pooled for the
analysis.
Results: 50% of Finnish girls and 33% of boys, and
56% of Greek girls and 47% of boys controlled their
weight, mostly exercising and dieting. Overall, Greek
adolescents controlled their weight 24% (95% CI 19%,
30%) more often than Finns. Normal weight adolescents
who saw themselves as overweight (i.e. 23% of Finnish
girls, 6% of Finnish boys, 22% of Greek girls and 8% of
Greek boys) controlled their weight as often as
overweight and obese adolescents, and twice as often as
normal weight adolescents who saw their weight
realistically. In Finnish overweight adolescents there
was a positive trend between opinion of weight and
prevalence of weight controlling. This trend was not
seen in Greek overweight adolescents.
Conclusions: Overestimated opinion of weight is
associated with weight control behaviour that can be
harmful. This behaviour is more common in girls than
boys, and more common in Greece than in Finland.
PREVENTING ANAEMIA OF PREMATURITY:
COMBINATION OF DELAYED CORD
CLAMPING (DCC), EARLY IRON AND
RESTRICTED TRANSFUSION REGIME IN
VERY LOW BIRTH WEIGHT INFANTS (VLBW)

University Hospitals, Brighton, UK
Background and Aims: VLBW have a 80% probability
of receiving blood transfusions for anaemia of
prematurity. Studies have investigated the preventative
effect of DCC, high dose iron or costly recombinant
erythropoietin (rh-EPO). We investigated the effect of a
preventative treatment regime of combining DCC of 30
seconds with early start of protein and oral feeds, early
oral iron (6mg/kg from day 7-10 of life, if milk feeds
60ml/kg/day) and a restrictive transfusion schedule
(WHYTE 2004) introduced for VLBW <32 weeks
gestation (GA), <1500g birth weight (BW).
Methods: Data on blood transfusions in VLBW during
the first six weeks of life were collected before the start
of the new combination (Period I) and compared with
data of consecutively born VLBW after the introduction
of the treatment regime (Period II). The day of life,
when milk feeds and oral iron were achieved, was
recorded. Statistical analysis with Wilcoxon signed
ranks test.
Results: VLBW in Period I (n=18, mean BW 955g
SD197) received a median of 4 transfusions [0.75:9]
compared to Period II (n=22 mean BW 950g SD200) of
1.5 transfusions [0.75;5] (p=0.028). Milk feeds of
60ml/kgBW/d were achieved on median day 9 [7;13.5]
and iron was introduced on median day 14 [11:21].
Conclusions: This combination, which has not been
described before, reduced the number of blood
transfusion by half. It was feasible to introduce oral iron
early, but this needs reinforcement so that infants do not
get missed out. Combined with rh-EPO it might even be
more effective.
COMBINED THERAPY WITH PIMECROLIMUS
CREAM 1% AND PROBIOTIC IN CHILDREN
WITH ATOPIC DERMATITIS
M L Aryayev, V N Kukushkin
Department of Pediatrics and Neonatology, Odessa
State Medical University, Odessa, Ukraine
Background and Aims: Pimecrolimus cream 1% and
probiotics have been recently developed for the
treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). The aims of the
study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
combined therapy - pimecrolimus (Elidel®) and
probiotic/prebiotic Lactobacterin plus® (p.Lactobacillus
and lactulose; Ukraine).
Methods: This was a 6-week parallel group study.
Patients in the age of 3-11 years with mild and moderate
AD were randomly assigned to pimecrolimus treatment
group I (n=30) and to pimecrolimus with Lactobacterin
plus® group II (n=30). Efficacy of treatment was
evaluated using Eczema Area and Severity Index
(EASI), Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score,
pruritus severity score.
Results: EASI and IGA scores were similar between
groups at baseline. The median EASI for group I
decreased during the study from 10,6 to 4,7 (55,7%), for
group II – from 9,8 to 3,6 (63,3%). Treatment success,
defined as IGA score 0-1, was achieved in 21 patients in
group I (70,0%) compared with 25 patients in group II
(83,3%; p<0,05). There were more patients who
reported their pruritus to be absent till the study end in
group II (79,8% and 89,3% respectively; p<0,05).
During 6 months after the study the exacerbation of AD
was not noticed in 50,1% patients of group I and in
73,4% patients of group II (p<0,01).
Conclusions: Long-term management with
pimecrolimus cream 1% improves the symptoms and
signs of AD and enhances the quality of life. The
additional administration of probiotic/prebiotic
positively influences the number of flares, the intensity
of pruritus and prevents early exacerbation of AD.

NICU, Catholic University, Rome, Italy
Background and Aims: In very premature infants
discomfort, breaks of the skin, and leaking from the
injection site could be associated to the subcutaneous
injection of recombinant erythropoietin (Epo). We
hypothesized that adding Epo to the intravenous solution
and administering it as a constant infusion (24h) would
result in an erythropoietic effect similar to that seen with
subcutaneous administration. Methods: Infants with
BW <1500 and GA <32 weeks were randomly assigned
at 72 hours of life to receive Epo (300 units/kg, 3 times
a week until 36 complete wks PMA or discharge), either
subcutaneously (ESC) or added to intravenous fluids
(EIV). Results: Sixty infants (30 EIV, BW 1120±280
gm, GA 29.0±2.3 wks; 30 ESC, BW 1190±280 gm, GA
29± 2.1 wks) met the criteria for randomization. The 2
groups did not differ at study entry with respect to the
infants' characteristics, hematologic values, and iron
metabolism. EIV and ESC infants received a similar
number of EPO administrations (19.2±8.8vs19.4±17.7)
and a similar cumulative iron dose (322±169vs301±145
mg). No differences were found between the 2 groups in
phlebotomy losses (27.6±12.7 vs 26.2±13.8 ml),
incidence of transfusions (40.0 vs 36.7%), number of
transfusion per infant (1.0±1.8 vs 0.8±1.9) and
cumulative transfusion volume (44.2±23.8 vs 53.3±32.3
ml). At the end of the study there were no differences in
the reticulocyte count (6.3±2.3 vs 6.1±1.9%), transferrin
saturation (35±12vs33±20%) and ferritin concentrations
(131±152 vs 114±148 ng/ml). Conclusions: In preterm
infants continuous intravenous administration of Epo
resulted in similar effectiveness as subcutaneous dosing.

Background and Aims: Differences in maturation of
the immune system in infancy may be related to
infectious diseases. The aims of this study were to
examine the maturation of the immune system in
healthy infants and its association with prenatal
determinants.
Methods: This study was embedded in the Generation
R Study, a population-based prospective cohort study
from fetal life until adulthood. Blood samples for
measurements of absolute numbers of T-cells, T-helper
cells (CD4+), T-cytotoxic cells (CD8+), B-cells and
NK-cells were collected in a subsample at birth (n =
981) and at the age of 6 months (n = 382). The
measurements are assessed using 6-color flow
cytometry.
Results: Preliminary results in the first 206 (birth) and
160 (age 6 months) infants demonstrated that the mean
difference of absolute numbers of T-cells, T-helper
cells, T-cytotoxic cells and B-cells was 1,74 (standard
error (SE) 0,14) x 109/L, 1,26 (SE 0,11) 109/L, 0,43 (SE
0.04) 109/L and 1,06 (SE 0,07) x 109/L, respectively
(figure 1). Mean difference of absolute numbers of NK-
cells was –0,60 (SE 0,05) x 109/L. Analyses of the
associations with prenatal determinants (maternal
infections, birth weight, gestational age) are currently
undertaken and will be presented additionally.
Conclusions: These preliminary results showed an
increase of the absolute number of T-cells, T-helper
cells, T-cytotoxic cells and B-cells and a decrease of
NK-cells from birth to the age of 6 months.

Background and Aims: Adiponectin secreted from
adipocytes is an antidiabetic, antiatherogenic, and anti-
inflammatory hormon. We aimed to investigate the
serum adiponectin levels in patients with lymphoma at
diagnosis and follow-up.
Methods: 23 newly diagnosed patients with lymphoma
were included in this study. Serum adiponectin levels
were measured at diagnosis and during the following
cycles of chemotherapy. Normal adiponectin level
ranged between 0.5 and 30 g/ml. Body mass index
(BMI), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, LDH and CRP
levels were also detected. Mean and median values were
used for analysis. Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon rank
tests were used to compare for two groups.
Results: There were 11 patients with Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (HL) and 12 with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
(NHL). The age range was between 3 and 17 with a
median of 8 years. Male/female ratio was 15/8. Median
adiponectin levels were 15.2 g/ml and 18.1 g/ml at
diagnosis and follow-up, respectively. 7 patients had
increased adiponectin levels (over 30 g/ml). The
diagnoses of these patients were HL in 5 and NHL in 2
patients. Five of them retained higher levels at the
remission. There was no significant correlation between
adiponectin levels and BMI and LDH.
Conclusions: Adiponectin levels were normal in most
of the patients with lymphoma. This was the first report
that evaluates adiponectin levels in children with
lymphoma.

CENTER EXPERIENCE
R Gil Gómez, A Herrero Hernández,
O Escobosa Sánchez, C Gómez Robles, T Acha García,
A Jurado Ortíz
Hospital Materno-Infantil Carlos Haya, Málaga, Spain
Background and Aims: Children with high risk
neuroblastoma (HRNB) represent the largest
neuroblastoma subgroup. In spite of standard treatment
the 5 years event-free survival rates are >30%. Our aim
is to determine overall survival (Kaplan-Meier) and to
evaluate prognostic factors related to the survival (log-
rank test).
Methods: Retrospective study of 24 HRNB from
January 1981-March 2006. Eligibility criteria: Children
>1 year with stage 4, or stage 2 and 3 with MYCN
amplification. 17/24 males. 22/24 abdominal (14/22
suprarenal) and 2 thoracic. Positive MYCN: 7/14. 19/24
died (3 perioperatory), 4/24 alive with disease, 1/24
alive without disease. Prognostic factors are LDH
(group 1 normal (N) levels, group 2 <x4N, group 3
>x4N), ferritin (normal, <x4N, >x4N), enolase (normal,
<x20N, >x20N), positive catecholamines, positive
MYCN, histology (group 1 neuroblastoma and group 2
ganglioneuroblastoma) and metastasis location (group 1
CNS, skeleton, pleural and lung; group 2 others).
Results: Mean age at diagnosis: 54±46 months. Overall
mean survival: 33 months (17-49), mean follow up 26
months (0-120). High LDH levels involved significant
worse prognosis (p=0.01). Ferritin and enolase levels,
positive catecholamines and metastasis location at
diagnosis were not significant. MYCN positive patients
had 4 months of mean survival (p<0.05). Intermediate
significance (p=0.06) was found from group 1 histology.
Conclusions: Overall mean survival similar to others
pilot studies. Patients with high level of LDH at
diagnosis and positive MYCN had a significant poor
outcome. No conclusive significant results found for the
other prognostic factors, although neuroblastoma is
likely to produce a worse outcome than
ganglioneuroblastoma.

Background and Aims: The role of corticosteroids in
initial treatment of Kawasaki disease (KD) is not
established.
Methods: Between September 2000 and March 2005
we randomly assigned 178 KD patients from 12
hospitals to either an intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG) group (n=88; 1 g/kg for 2 consecutive days) or
an IVIG-plus-corticosteroids (IVIG+PSL) group (n=90).
The primary end point was coronary artery abnormality
(CAA) before a 1-month echocardiographic assessment.
Secondary end points included duration of fever, time
need for normalization of serum C-reactive protein
(CRP), and initial treatment failure requiring additional
therapy. Analyses were based on intention to treat.
Results: Baseline characteristics of groups were similar.
Fewer IVIG+PSL patients had CAA before 1 month
than IVIG patients (2.2% vs. 11.4%, P=0.017). The
duration of fever was shorter (P<0.001) and CRP
decreased more rapidly in the IVIG+PSL group than the
IVIG group (P=0.001). Moreover, initial treatment
failure was less frequent (5.6% vs. 18.2%, P=0.010) in
the IVIG+PSL group. All patients assigned to the
IVIG+PSL group completed treatment without major
side effects.
Conclusions: A combination of corticosteroids and
IVIG improved clinical course and coronary artery
outcome without causing untoward effects in children
with acute KD.

Background and Aims: MCP-1 is involved in the
initiation and progression of tubulointerstitial damage.
We studied the role of MCP-1 in the pathogenesis of
progression of acute pyelonephritis in febrile infants.
Methods: Twenty children were included in the study.
Initial DMSA scan of all patients revealed renal lesions
in 12. Follow-up scans performed six months later in all
patients showed reversible lesions in 3 and renal scars in
9. MCUG performed in all patients revealed significant
vesicureteral reflux (Grade III) in 5/20 and mild reflux
(Grade II) in 2/20. MCP-1 plasma levels on admission
and 3 days after initiation of treatment were measured.
Results: MCP-1 was increased in all patients at
diagnosis of the urinary tract infection (p<0.001). We
compared the values of MCP-1 in patients with normal
DMSA and in patients with renal lesions and we
observed that MCP-1 either remained high or further
increased in patients abnormal DMSA. MCP-1 was not
'affected' by the initiation of treatment in this group of
patients and especially in those patients who ended up
with renal scarring. Similar results were found in the
group of patients with the severe vesicureteral reflux.
- 56 -
MCP-1 also decreased after treatment in the group of
patients with initially normal DMSA, as it also
decreased in the small group of patients with the
reversible lesions.
Conclusions: Apparently, MCP-1 is more than just a
chemoattractant. Its role as a direct elicitor of an
inflammatory response may lead to conclusions with
more clinical aspects regarding the prognosis of an acute
renal damage in humans.
DEVELOPING A MULTI PROFESSIONAL,
MULTI SITE CLINICAL NETWORK TO
ENHANCE THE ACCESS TO ACUTE SERVICES
FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE WITH
LONG TERM VENTILATOR NEEDS
C M Way
PICU, St Georges Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK
Background and Aims: In recent years a number of
government and local reports have highlighted the
challenges of providing high quality services that meet
the needs of technology dependent children. This is
particularly pertinent to the care of children and young
people who are dependant on long-term ventilation, as
their care may become problematic when it needs to be
provided across the geographical and professional
boundaries of different care settings. The purpose of this
project was to develop a multidisciplinary clinical
network between three different but complementary care
settings that provided acute and community services to
local children with LTV needs. Our aim was to insure
the provision of timely, proactive admission to
paediatric intensive/high dependency care for these
children when they became acutely unwell.
Methods:
-A network between the three sites was established.
-The networked established the key issues in providing a
seamless admission pathway for this group of children
and young adults through the three centres were
identified over a 5-month period.
-A collaborative three-centre action plan was then
developed in light of the key issues.
Results: Key Issues identified for the DGH
-DGH staff had anxiety about caring for these
technology dependant children because of the lack of
knowledge and expertise e.g. care of the ventilated
child.
-The DGH had difficulties in providing staff with the
appropriate knowledge and skill to accommodate
admission of acutely unwell technology dependant
children.
-There were both resource and operational issues that
prevented transfer of the sick technology dependant
child to another facility better able to manage the
technology aspects of care. Key issues identified for the
Children’s Trust.
-The Children’s Trust staff perceived they needed
improved immediate access to acute services and
nursing/medical expertise and facilities.
-They felt the current provision for updating knowledge
and skill regarding the care of the ventilator dependent
child needed to be improved, for example, with regard
to: cardio-respiratory assessment, update on recognising
the deteriorating child.
-They had a lack of access to support regarding
equipment and ventilator troubleshooting.
-They felt there was a need for regular multidisciplinary
assessment of this group of children in order to more
proactively treat and manage any acute illness. In a hope
too not only insure timely access to HDU/PICU
facilities but also to reduce the need for this access.
Conclusions: As a result of these key issues we have:-
-Established a monthly outreach clinic at the Children’s
Trust led by the PICU consultant and myself.
-Started to facilitate educational packages across the
three sites in relation to high dependency issues.
-Begun to develop shared clinical and patient transfer
guidelines.
-Developed closer working relationships with all three
centres.
-Began some initial planning to evaluate the
effectiveness of the outreach clinic and its impact on the
quality of care.
CURRENT PRACTICE AND MANAGEMENT OF
CVVH - SETTING THE STANDARD IN
PAEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE
J White
PICU/Forest Ward, Evelina Children's Hospital, Guy's
and St Thomas NHS Trust, London, UK
Inconsistencies in practice and differing levels of
experience dictate that clear standards and guidelines are
available for staff when caring for children who require
CVVH. These standards and guidelines provide
essential support and guidance to both nursing and
medical staff whilst caring for children who require this
complex intervention. In the early 1990's, a core group
of nurses experienced in CVVH, were established. This
group continue to lead and manage this challenging
service. They are responsible for formulating and
guiding practice, and provide support within the
multidisciplinary team. Achievements of the group to
date include:
- Development of a resource booklet? formulation of a
competency document .
- Implementation of an education plan.
The booklet includes guidelines based on current best
evidence. It provides information on all aspects of
CVVH and is utilized by both nurses and doctors when
managing the care of children on CVVH. The
competency document allows 'experts' in the core group
to assess nurses caring for children who require and
receive CVVH, ensuring competencies are met and
standards maintained. Specific CVVH Study Day's and
yearly updates form part of the PICU Education Plan to
ensure nurses are given time to develop their knowledge
and skills in this challenging area. The use of reflection
is encouraged throughout this process. Annual National
CVVH meetings also help to ensure knowledge and
experiences are shared throughout the United Kingdom
and provide the opportunity for staff to discuss their
experiences and best practice. The initial aims of the
group have been achieved and we continue to review
practice whilst evaluating the effectiveness of care

to work collaboratively to meet the educational needs of
the nursing and medical staff whilst caring for children
who require renal replacement therapy in a safe and
consistent environment.
TECHNOLOGICALLY DEPENDENT CHILD
AND INFANT AT HOME
M Johansson
PICU, The Queen Silvia Children's Hospital,
Gothenburg, Sweden
Advances in the care of the critically ill child have
reduced mortality but have also introduced a new group
of patients in our intensive care units. These patients
have a constant need of high technology equipment to
stay alive and the treatment will unfortunately at times
involve prolonged support for weeks, months, years or
even permanently. The required treatment will differ
from oxygen inhalation to ventilator support, extensive
medication to intravenous infusions, peritoneal dialysis
or renal replacement therapy etc. Appropriate care is a
challenge as life in hospital is an unsuitable environment
for these children as well as an inappropriate use of
hospital funding and resources. A transition of care has
to take place and the pathway is important for the
outcome. To shift the responsibility from hospital
professionals toward home care services lies mainly on
the neonatologist, paediatrician or health care
coordinator. It is important to have a strategy and a well-
prepared schedule prior to discharge. Many problems
with technical equipment, home environment, staff etc
will arise during the process and needs to be taken care
of in a professional way. We also need to address
emotional, economical and moral issues related to
caring for a technology- dependent child at home. By
using research, case reports and reflections from parents
I will try to enlighten the physiological, psychological as
well as the social problems we are facing during our
efforts to give a good quality care to the child and
family in the home environment.
FIRST EXPERIENCES WITH INTRAHOSPITAL
TRANSFER OF PRETERM INFANTS AND SICK
NEWBORNS ON A OMNIBED AS TRANSPORT
INKUBATOR (MONITORING, VENTILATOR)
WITHOUT CHANGING THE UNIT
M Schindler, I Berlett, S Dahlmann, F Loersch
University Children's Hospital, Mannheim, Germany
Background and Aims: In the last few years in our
hospital we have to transfer sick newborns from
delivery room to NICU in a transport incubator. These
transports resulting in significant thermal stress,
respiratory and hemodynamic instability. We have
developed a novel device to improve thermoneutral
environment during this early critical phase, which
incorporates an overhead warmer and an incubator. The
purpose of this study was to compare the impact of
using this device on admission thermal stability.
Methods: 35 newborns were included in this cohort
study. Twentyone infants with birth weights of less then
1500g and fourteen sick children (CDH, n=12, CCAM
n=2) were transported in a Giraffe OmniBed from
delivery room to the NICU. After delivery, the babies
were resuscitated in the labor and delivery area using the
device in the open bed, radiant warmer mode and then
transported in closed bed, incubator mode to the NICU
(a distance of approximately 500m).
Results: All initial resuscitation procedures were
performed without any problems using the overhead
mode. The average rectal temperature measured
immediately upon admission to the NICU for all babies
was 36,7 C (median, range 36,2–37,2 C). The average
temperature was 0,4 C higher than in the control group
of 30 babies transported with a conventional transport
incubator.
Conclusions: Using this novel hybrid device for
resuscitation in the delivery room and for transfer to the
NICU resulted in improved thermal stability. This
device allows to initiate and maintain mechanical
ventilation without any disruption and more aspects of
the minimal handling started earlier.

Intensive Care, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London,
UK
Background and Aims: Both palliative care (PC) and
intensive care (IC) provide support to children and
families facing potential or inevitable death. However
the focus of IC is to initiate active treatments, whereas
the philosophy of PC is to enable children to achieve an
optimal quality of life despite no expectation of cure.
The purpose of this study was to determine if families
would choose a PC approach over IC when their child
faces inevitable death.
Methods: Referrals to a PC team were monitored over a
3-year period. The children referred were assessed in 2
groups: those referred to PC before an IC admission and
those referred whilst on IC. Place of death was recorded
for each child.
Results: 203 children were referred to PC, 55 from IC
and 148 from non-IC sources. 125 non-IC referrals died,
only 2 (1.6%) chose to go to IC at the end-of-life. 54
(43%) of them died at home or in a hospice and the
remainder died in hospital. Of the 55 children referred
from IC, 43 were ventilated at the time of referral, 38
died. Only 18 (42%) chose to stay on IC. Nine chose to
go home or to a hospice and 6 transferred to a hospital
nearer to home.
Conclusions: Children and families facing inevitable
death are less likely to choose an IC admission when
supported by a PC service. Families already on IC will
often choose continuing PC support move out of IC to
alternative places under PC.

Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: There is a group of critically ill
children with a prolonged stay on the PICU (> 28 days).
They take a lot of PICU resource utilisation. The daily
care of these children needs special attention of the
nursing staff because the difficulties of dealing with an
uncertain prognosis and increasing demands of the
children and parents. Objective: Investigating the
number of children with a prolonged stay in the last 3
years (2003-2005) in context with the weekly support of
the medical and nursing staff.
Methods: We looked if and when a primary nurse was
appointed to the children, the number of regular
conversations with the parents by doctors together with
nurses, the number of interdisciplinary and
multidisciplinary patient rounds.
Results: In a 3-year period 120 children (equal gender)
with a prolonged stay were admitted. Diagnoses were
mainly children with (multiple) congenital
malformations and tracheal abnormalities. The mean
stay of these children was 85 days (range 28-484). Nine
children were admitted more than once. 25% of the
children died. Regular conferences with all parents took
place once/twice a week. In 19% of the children
interdisciplinary rounds were done and in 12%
multidisciplinary rounds were done. In 68% a primary
nurse was appointed but in the majority these nurses
were appointed half way admission.
Conclusions: There is no well-structured protocol for
children who have a prolonged stay on the ICU
concerning interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary
rounds. There is need for the early introduction of a co-
ordinating primary nurse in the overall support of these
children.
CO-BEDDING PREMATURE BORN
MULTIPLES: AN EVIDENCE-BASED
APPROACH
J M Wielenga
IC Neonatology, Emma Children's Hospital/Academic
Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: After the introduction of
developmental care in 2003, professionals as well as
parents wished to nurse premature born multiples in one
incubator. Co-bedding can be seen as the continuation of
the proximity and interaction experienced during the
intrauterine period of multiple-gestation infants after
birth. It seems reasonably to assume that multiple-
gestation infants are born with expectations based on
their earlier intrauterine experiences. The transition of
multiple-gestation to the extra uterine life can be
simplified through stimuli generated by the continuous
uninterrupted physical contact. The aim of this project
was to study literature and collect information on co-
bedding, mainly on the adverse effects of co-bedding.
The information collected was used to compose a best-
evidence guideline for the new standard of care: co-
bedding premature born multiples.
Methods: The study was carried out in the Emma
Children s Hospital / Academic Medical Center in
Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We used the method of
Critical Appraised Topic (CAT) with the PICO (patient-
intervention-comparison-outcome) system formulated
as: Are multiple borns admitted to the NICU (P) who
are co-bedded (I) instead of single-bedded (C) exposed
to complication risks or physiological instability (O)?
Literature search was performed within PubMed,
Cinahl, Embase and the Cochrane Library.
Results: Literature search resulted in 22 hits until
December 2003: 17 comments and background articles
and 5 scientific papers. From the latter, 3 were selected
based on the strength of the designs of the study; one
randomised, one prospective cohort and one
comparative descriptive design. All studies had small
populations, respectively 37- 22-155 infants and co-
bedding periods varied from 24 hours to 5 days. On
complications and physiological instability, was
reported in 2 out of 3 studies. No adverse effects or
increased infection rates were found. Disruptions of co-
bedding were never necessary. Physiological stability of
co-bedded infants was the same as single-bedded, at
some points significant improvement was found, mainly
on growth and apnoeas (frequency as well as duration).
Co-bedding procedures were described in detail in 2 out
of 3 studies.
Conclusions: Based on the findings we made a
guideline and to introduced co-bedding in two steps. We
started co-bedding with respiratory stable infants after
an evaluation we introduced co-bedding to infants on
CPAP as well. We still monitor each co-bedding
session.

Background and Aims: Materno-foetal and nosocomial
infections are frequent causes of morbidity and mortality
in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Their prognosis
are closely related to early diagnosis and treatment but
clinical signs are very poorly specific nor sensitive. In
this context, paediatricians frequently initiate early
antibiotherapy, exposing non infected newborns to
unnecessary treatment. The aim of our work was to
evaluate the value of procalcitonin (PCT) as an early
and specific marker of perinatal bacterial sepsis.
- 59 -
Methods: Two different studies were conducted. In 197
neonates with suspected materno-foetal infection, serum
procalcitonin and C-Reactive Protein concentrations
were measured simultaneously in umbilical cord blood
and in maternal blood. According to clinical and
bacteriological course, three groups were defined: group
1 = infected (n=16); group 2= colonized (n=20); group 3
= non infected and non colonized In 176 preterm
neonates (mean 29,8). Hospitalised in neonatal intensive
care units more than 48h and with a clinical suspicion of
nosocomial infection, PCT was determined immediatly
and 24 hours later. Two groups were defined: infected
and non infected.
Results: In the population with suspected maternofoetal
infection, a statistically higher serum procalcitonin
concentration was found in the infected group versus
controls and colonized (p<0.05). According to the the
ROC curves, we chose a cut-off point of 0,5 ng/ml for
PCT and 5mg/l for CRP. A PCT value greater or equal
to 0.5 ng/ml was observed in 14/16 infected newborns
and in 2/181 non infected newborns. The CRP dosage
was > 5 mg/l in 8/16 infected newborns. Sensitivity,
specificity, and positive and negative predictive values
were respectively 87.5% (95% confidence interval 71 to
100), 98.7% (97.7 to 99.7), 87.5% (71 to 100), and
98.7% (97.7 to 99.7) for PCT, and 50% (25 to 75), 97%
(94 to 100), 67% (40 to 94), and 94% (81 to 100) for
CRP. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were
respectively 67.3 and 0.13 for PCT and 16.7 and 0.51
for CRP. Maternal PCT serum level was negative in all
cases. In the population with suspected nosocomial
infection, 45 cases were defined as infected, 31
infections were proved by bacteriological cultures. Most
of the proven infections were caused by coagulase
negative staphylocoque (51,6%) and staphylocoque
aureus (22,5%). With the cut off value of 0,5ng/ml, the
sensitivity for diagnosis of bacterial infection was
91,3%, specificity 93,9%, positive predictive value 84%,
negative predictive value 96%. Positive and negative
likelihood ratios was respectively14.9 and 0,09.
Conclusions: Although maternal PCT dosage does not
seem to be informative, serum procalcitonin in cord
blood seems to be a useful and early marker of antenatal
infection. Furthermore, PCT would be an interesting
marker of nosocomial infection. This could improve the
outcome of perinatal infection allowing early treatment
as well as reducing the number of unnecessary
antibiotherapies.
PROCALCITONIN IN PAEDIATRIC
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS FOR THE
EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF BACTERIAL
INFECTION IN FEBRILE INFANTS
A Fernandez Lopez
Spain
Background and Aims: Procalcitonin (PCT) is a
potentially useful marker in pediatric Emergency
Departments (ED). The basic objectives of this study
were to assess the diagnostic performance of PCT for
distinguishing between viral and bacterial infections and
for the early detection of invasive bacterial infections in
febrile children between 1 and 36 months old comparing
it with C-reactive protein (CRP) and to evaluate the
utility of a qualitative rapid test for PCT in ED.
Methods: Prospective, observational and multicenter
study that included 445 children who were treated for
fever in pediatric ED. Quantitative and qualitative
plasma values of PCT and CRP were correlated with the
final diagnosis. To obtain the qualitative level of PCT
the BRAHMS PCT-Q rapid test was used.
Results: Mean PCT and CRP values in viral infections
were 0.26 ng/ml and 15.5 mg/l, respectively. The area
under the curve obtained for PCT in distinguishing
between viral and bacterial infections was 0.82
(sensitivity, 65.5%; specificity, 94.3%; optimum cutoff,
0.53 ng/ml), whereas for CRP it was 0.78 (sensitivity,
63.5%; specificity, 84.2%; optimum cutoff, 27.5 mg/l).
PCT and CRP values in invasive infections (PCT, 24.3
ng/ml; CRP 96.5 mg/l) were significantly higher than
those for noninvasive infections (PCT, 0.32 ng/ml; CRP,
23.4 mg/l). The area under the curve for PCT was 0.95
(sensitivity, 91.3%; specificity, 93.5%; optimum cutoff,
0.59 ng/ml), significantly higher (P < 0.001) than that
obtained for CRP (0.81). The optimum cutoff value for
CRP was >27.5 mg/l with sensitivity and specificity of
78 and 75%, respectively. In infants in whom the
evolution of fever was <12 h (n _ 104), the diagnostic
performance of PCT was also greater than that of CRP
(area under the curve, 0.93 for PCT and 0.69 for CRP; P
< 0.001). A good correlation between the quantitative
values for PCT and the PCT-Q test was obtained in 87%
of cases (kappa index, 0.8). The sensitivity of the PCT-
Q test (cutoff >0.5 ng/ml) for detecting invasive
infections and differentiating them from noninvasive
infections was 90.6%, with a specificity of 83.6%.
Conclusions: PCT offers better specificity than CRP for
differentiating between the viral and bacterial etiology
of the fever with similar sensitivity. PCT offers better
sensibility and specificity than CRP to differentiate
between invasive and noninvasive infection. PCT is
confirmed as an excellent marker in detecting invasive
infections in ED and can even make early detection
possible of invasive infections if the evolution of the
fever is <12 h. The PCT-Q test has a good correlation
with the quantitative values of the marker.

Background and Aims: Distinguishing between
bacterial meningitis (BM) and aseptic meningitis (AM)
in the emergency department (ED) is sometimes
difficult, but could be very helpful to avoid unnecessary
hospitalisations and antibiotic treatments. Five clinical
decision rules combining clinical and biological
parameters available at the time of admission were
proposed in the literatture. We herein report a research
program aiming at identifying the best rule and at
improving it, and we discuss future research issues.
Methods: Data from a retrospective single-center study
(n=166 patients, 20 with BM), a secondary analysis of
the ACTIV/GPIP French prospective registry of BM in
children (n=890), and a retrospective multicenter
European cohort study (6 centers in 5 countries, n=198,
96 with BM) were used (1) to compare existing rules
and identify the ‘‘best’’ one, (2) to validate the ‘‘best’’
rule on a large population of children with BM, (3) to
identify the best biological predictor of BM (serum
procalcitonin -PCT- at the time of admission), (4) to
validate this predictor, and (5) to combine this new
predictor in a new clinical decision rule.
Results: In the single-center study, the best rule
(defined [Dubos, Arch Dis Child, 2006] as the one
yielding 100% sensitivity for BM, the highest specificity
-60%- and the greatest simplicity for a bedside
application) was the Nigrovic rule [Nigrovic, Pediatrics,
2002]: start antibiotics in case of seizure, blood
neutrophil count 10,000/mm3, positive CSF Gram-
staining, CSF protein 80 mg/dL, or CSF neutrophil
count 1,000/mm3. However, this rule only achieved
99.3% sensitivity (95% CI: 98.8–99.9) on a large
population of patients with BM. Both in the single-
center [Dubos, J Pediatr, 2006] and the multicenter
European studies, PCT had the best area under the ROC
curve (0.98, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99), statistically different (p
<0.05) from the other biologic markers. With a 0.5
ng/mL threshold, PCT had 99% sensitivity (95% CI: 94-
100) and 83% specificity (95% CI: 74-90).
Incorporating PCT in a new rule called Meningitest
(start antibiotics in case of seizure, purpura, toxic
appearance, procalcitonin 0.5 ng/mL, positive CSF
Gram-staining, CSF protein 50 mg/dL) had 100%
sensitivity and 56% specificity on the population of the
single-center study.
Conclusions: To distinguish between bacterial and
aseptic meningitis in children in the ED: (1) the
Nigrovic rule is a very sensitive and validated tool but
do not achieve 100% sensitivity, (2) PCT is now
validated as the best biological predictor, (3) a PCT-
based decision rule (the Meningitest) is a promizing tool
that needs further (ongoing) validation. Funding:

Background and Aims: Febrile urinary tract infection
(FUTI) reveals vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in 20-40%
of children. Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is then
recommended systematically, but is painful, expensive,
exposes to radiation and is a posteriori normal in
60-80% of cases. Then, selective approaches for VCUG
are needed. We herein report various strategies proposed
to achieve this goal, and discuss future research issues.
Methods: A retrospective single-center cohort study
(n=136, including 25% patients with VUR), and a
secondary analysis of 8 prospective European cohort
studies (n=398, including 25% patients with VUR) were
performed, and included consecutive patients aged 1
month to 4 years with a first FUTI. The data were used
to evaluate the reproducibility of the clinical decision
rule proposed by Oostenbrink et al [Acta Pediatr, 2000]
aiming at predicting VUR using a risk score combining
clinical (family history of uropathology, male gender,
young age), biological (elevated C-reactive protein) and
radiological (urinary tract dilation on renal ultrasound)
variables. Then, we identified and validated a new
predictor of VUR: a high serum procalcitonin (PCT)
level at the time of diagnosis. Univariate and
multivariate analyses were performed.
Results: The rule proposed by Oostenbrink et al yielded
100% sensitivity and 3% specificity for all-grade VUR
(vs 100% sensitivity and 17% specificity in the original
study), and 93% sensitivity and 13% specificity for
grade 3 VUR (vs 100% sensitivity and 38% specificity
in the original study). Some methodological weaknesses
(variables selection and cotation) may explain this lack
of reproducibility [Leroy, Arch Dis Child, 2006]. Both
in the single-center [Leroy, Pediatrics, 2005] and the
multicenter European study [Leroy, in revision], the
median value of PCT was significantly higher in
children with vs without VUR: 1.6 vs 0.7 ng/mL (p
<0.001). After dichotomisation around a 0.5 ng/mL
threshold, there was a significant association between
VUR and high PCT [OR=2.3, 95% CI 1.3-3.9,
p=0.001]. After logistic-regression adjustment for all
potential confounders (young age, male gender, positive
family history for uropathy, C-reactive protein, urinary
tract dilatation on renal ultrasonography, urine technique
collection - sterile bags vs suprapubic aspiration or
transurethral catheterization), the association remained
significant (OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.4-4.4; p=0.001). The
strength of the relationship increased with the grade of
reflux VUR grade (p <0.001). The sensitivity of PCT
was 75% (95% CI: 66-83) for all-grade VUR and 100%
(95% CI: 81-100) for grade 4 or 5 VUR, both with 43%
specificity (95% CI: 37-48).
- 61 -
Conclusions: The potential contribution of the rule
proposed by Oostenbrink et al seems to be modest. PCT
is a strong, independent and validated predictor for
VUR. It could be used to identify patients with low risk
for VUR to avoid unnecessary VCUG, alone or
combined with other predictors (that need to be
identified and validated) in a new clinical decision rule.
Then, impact studies with cluster randomization will be
needed to evaluate the real impact of this rule in day-to-
day practice. Funding: unrestricted educational grants
were received from AJP, FRM, PHRC AOM 05 110 and

GENETICS IN SEPSIS
J A Hazelzet
PICU, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Sepsis is a polygenic and
complex syndrome that is initiated by infection and is
characterized by a host response which consist of a
systemic inflammatory response. This host response can
be quite different between individuals. Genetic
polymorphisms in this immune response to infection can
partly explain these differences and have been shown to
be associated with clinical outcomes. Functional and
association studies involving genetic polymorphisms in
essential genes. These include specific and aspecific
recognition of pathogen associated microbial patterns,
signaling receptors like Toll-like receptors, primary and
secondary inflammatory proteins like cytokines and
chemokines, and coagulation and fibrinolysis factors
These polymorphisms have provided important insights
into the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of
sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. The advancement of
high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
genotyping will provide valuable information on the
interaction of multiple allelic variants and clinical
outcome. More precise categorization of patients based
on genetic background is likely to lead to individualized
targeted treatment. A specific example of pediatric
sepsis is the meningococcal sepsis. The clinical
presentation of infections caused by Neisseria
meningitidis is highly diverse. Some patients develop
meningitis, and others present with sepsis or even septic
shock. Genetic differences might explain this diversity.
Genetic polymorphisms among components of the host
response have been shown to be involved in the
susceptibility, severity, and outcome of meningococcal
disease.
Methods: Literature search and own findings.
Results: An overview will be given of the most recently
found polymorphism and their possible impact in the
host response.
Conclusions: Future therapeutic trials as well as actual
treatment regimens for patients with sepsis are likely to
be designed to target specific genotypes and associated
cellular responses, maximizing clinical response and
patient safety.
IMMUNE DEPRESSION IN POST SEPSIS
J A Carcillo
Department of Critical Care Medicine and Pediatrics,
University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA
Background and Aims: Nosocomial sepsis is a leading
cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill
neonates and children. This lecture will describe the
elements of CRitical Illness Stress-induced Immune
Suppression (CRISIS) as a cause of nosocomial sepsis.
Methods: Immune phenotyping and immune
modulation findings from our center, as well as an
evidenced based review of basic and clinical literature
on this topic, will be presented.
Results: Nosocomial sepsis and mortality risk is
predicted by the presence of neutropenia, absolute
lymphocyte count < 1,000, and monocyte HLA-DR
expression < 30% or whole blood TNF response to LPS
< 200 pg/mL. Stress or medication induced lymphocyte
apoptosis leads to monocyte deactivation
(immunoparalysis). Monocyte deactivation leads to the
inability of adherent PMNs to apoptose (ARDS). These
conditions can be effectively reversed with nutritional
and medical strategies.
Conclusions: The study and implementation of
immunephenotype-directed therapies are warranted to
address the epidemic of nosocomial sepsis in newborns
and children.
HEMODYNAMIC CHANGES DURING
HEMOFILTRATION IN MENINGOCOCCAL
SEPTICAEMIA
P Maheshwari, R Chhabra, M Clement, C DeMunter
PICU, St Mary's Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: There is good theoretical
background for the treatment of severe sepsis with
haemofiltration. The aim was to review the
cardiovascular effects of veno-venous haemofiltration in
severe meningococcal septic shock.
Methods: All patients with severe meningococcal sepsis
who were hemofiltered in our paediatric intensive care
unit were included in the study. Parameters including
inotropic requirement, metabolic acidosis, fluid
requirement and blood lactate were recorded 12 hours
before starting hemofiltration, at the time of starting, 6,
12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after initiating
hemofiltration.
Results: 27 patients from 6 months to 16 years of age
(median 5.5 years) with increasing fluid and inotropic
requirements, anuria, worsening lactic acidemia and
base deficits were hemofiltered within 48 hours of
admission. Three patients died of fulminant
cardiovascular shock within the first 12 hours of their
admission and all within 4 hours of initiating
haemofiltration. They were not included in the
following analysis. The mean PRISM score among the
24 survivors was 64.7. At the time of initiation of
haemofiltration, patients were on a mean adrenaline
infusion of 2.35mcg/Kg/min and a mean noradrenaline
infusion of 0.95 mcg/Kg/min. There was a rapid and
significant improvement in cardiovascular status after a
mean of 6 hours of initiation of haemofiltration: Blood
pressure stabilised and fluid requirements decreased.
Base deficit improved, blood lactic acid levels and doses
- 62 -
of adrenaline and noradrenaline all rapidly reduced
(p value <0.0001) by ANOVA.
Conclusions: The initiation of haemofiltration in cases
of severe meningococcal septicaemia was associated
with rapid improvements in cardiovascular status.

Background and Aims: To investigate the influence of
one single bolus of etomidate used for intubation on
adrenal function in children with meningococcal sepsis.
Methods: Retrospective study of 60 children admitted
between 1997 and 2004 to the PICU with
meningococcal sepsis, not treated with steroids. Adrenal
hormone concentrations were determined as soon as
possible after PICU admission, 12 and 24 hours
thereafter. To assess disease severity, PRISM score and
selected laboratory parameters were determined.
Results: On admission, before blood was drawn, 23
children had been intubated with etomidate, 8 without
etomidate and 29 were not intubated. Children who were
intubated had significantly higher disease severity
parameters, whereas none of these parameters
significantly differed between children who were
intubated with or without etomidate. Children who
received etomidate had significantly lower ratios of
cortisol over ACTH and lower ratios of cortisol over 11-
deoxycortisol than those who did not receive etomidate
(figure). Arterial glucose levels were significantly lower
in children who were intubated with etomidate than in
children who were not intubated. Eight children died, 7
of them had received etomidate. Within 24h
cortisol/ACTH ratios increased significantly in children
who had received etomidate, but not in children who
had not receive etomidate, resulting in comparable
cortisol/ACTH ratios 24h after admission.
Conclusions: Our data imply that even one single bolus
of etomidate negatively influences adrenal function and
thereby might increase risk of death.

Background and Aims: To evaluate markers of
infection in critically ill children, comparing
lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), soluble CD14 (sCD14),
procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP).
Methods: Prospective observational study in the level
III multidisciplinary paediatric intensive care unit.
Forty-nine children with systemic inflammatory
response syndrome (SIRS) and suspected infection were
classified into two groups: SIRS – sepsis (n = 30) and
SIRS – no sepsis (n = 19). The median age was 2.4
years. The disease severity was high (mean PRISM III
score= 16.5). Serum concentrations of LBP, LPS,
sCD14, PCT and CRP were measured on two
consecutive days. Area under the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), sensitivity,
specificity and predictive values were evaluated.
Correlations between markers of infection were
examined.
Results: Serum LBP was significantly higher in
children with SIRS - sepsis than in children with non-
infectious SIRS at both time points (day 0 p < 0.0001,
day 1 p = 0.003). AUC on the day of suspected infection
was 0.82 for LBP, 0.72 for LPS, 0.53 for sCD14, 0.76
for PCT, and 0.69 for CRP. Positive correlation was
found between LBP and CRP, and between CRP and
PCT concentrations in children with SIRS – sepsis. PCT
and sCD14 concentrations were significantly higher in
children with a high PRISM III score.
Conclusions: In critically ill children LBP on the first
day of suspected infection is a better marker of sepsis
than LPS, sCD14, PCT and CRP. LBP is correlated with
CRP in children with sepsis.

Background and Aims: Croup syndrome is a common
diagnosis in paediatrics with a benign, self-limited
course. Only patients with inspiratory stridor at rest and
respiratory distress are hospitalized and about 1%
require intubation. However, bacterial tracheitis,
pneumonia, and sepsis can complicate croup syndrome
and significantly increase morbidity and mortality.
Beside the “classical” respiratory problems there is little
awareness about these potentially life-threatening
- 63 -
complications among paediatricians. This study aims to
provide data about the incidence and prognosis of sepsis
in croup-patients. Methods: In this observational single
centre study all children admitted to our 16-beds,
tertiary level paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) due
to severe croup syndrome were retrieved from the
prospective database. Results: Over a 14 year period, 63
patients with 65 episodes of croup syndromes required
mechanical ventilation for an average duration of 4.2 d
(range 0.1-23.8 d). 10 patients (15%) fulfilled the
criteria of severe sepsis or septic shock. In 80% bacterial
cultures of tracheal aspirates were positive. 5 children
survived after 9.6 d (2-14.3) of mechanical ventilation;
in this group circulatory failure was present in 80%. The
other 5 patients died after a ventilation period of 0.8 d
(0.1-2.7). Main cause of death were persistent hypoxic
respiratory failure and brain death after pre-hospital
cardiac arrest. Conclusions: Risk for severe sepsis or
septic shock in patients with mechanical ventilation due
to croup induced respiratory failure is 15% with a
mortality of 50%. Croup-patients with significant
respiratory complications should carefully be monitored
for sepsis-syndromes with additional organ failures.

Multidisciplinary Pediatric Intensive Care Unit,
Hôpital de Bicêtre, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France
Background and Aims: To characterize clinical
spectrum of severe imported malaria in children living
in non-endemic region.
Methods: Retrospective study of all children admitted
in a single tertiary pediatric ICU over a 15 years period.
Severe imported malaria was considered if severe
malaria met 2001 WHO criteria and occurred in children
after returning from a travel in endemic region.
Results: Twenty-eight children with a mean age of 6.0
± 4.2 years-old were identified. In all but one with
Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium falciparum was found.
On admission, the most frequently encountered
symptoms were fever (96%), abdominal symptoms
(89%) and apathy (57%). Seizures occurred in 32%,
including three patients with status epilepticus. 29% of
the patients displayed a dehydration >10%. Nine
patients were mechanically ventilated, seven for a
comatos state and two for an ARDS. Two patients
presented a hypovolemic shock. Neuromalaria was
diagnosed in 11 patients (39%). Four patients (14%) had
a renal failure requiring renal replacement, two a liver
failure and three a disseminated intravascular
coagulation. Nine patients (32%) displayed one or two
failing organs and four patients (14%), three or more
organs. No children died and no children had
neurological sequel.
Conclusions: This is the largest reported series of
severe imported malaria in children. Clinical spectrum
of severe imported malaria in children living in non-
endemic region significantly differs from the one in
endemic region and classically described in the
literature.
MECHANISMS OF VASCULAR

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is characterized by a
phase of arrest in vascular development associated with
vasoobliteration, which is followed by an ischemic
phase resulting in neovascularization. Major factors
involved in vascular degeneration include a suppression
in VEGF expression combined with a rise in reactive
oxygen species and corresponding peroxidation
products. On one hand, ischemia-induced retinal (rather
than preretinal) neovascularization can be considered
beneficial in salvaging the tissue. Yet, despite
production of angiogenic factors and nitric oxide within
ischemic tissues, compensatory ingrowth of new vessels
fails to provide adequate vascularization. Thus, we
hypothesized that local factors counter efficient
revascularization via nitrosative stress related pathways.
Along with hypoxia, ischemia also produces a
concomitant elevation of CO2. In the developing
subject, hypercapnia has been associated with the
development of ROP in humans and confirmed
experimentally. However, the significance of
hypercapnia, particularly on neovascularization, has
been relatively overlooked compared to the numerous
studies on hypoxia. We investigated the mechanisms by
which hypercapnia impair vascular development. We
found that acute and prolonged CO2 exposures inhibit
developmental neovascularization of the retinal
vasculature, as well as revascularization of the ischemic
retina. This was associated with increased eNOS,
generation of highly reactive nitrogen species (including
peroxynitrite) and downregulation of the pro-survival
and angiogenic PGE2 receptor, EP3; VEGF and its
receptors were not affected. NOS inhibitors as well as
peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst FeTPPS prevented
hypercapnia-induced vasoattenuation. Furthermore, we
illustrate that in vitro CO2 results in a NO-dependent
microvascular endothelial cell (EC) protein nitration and
cell death. Mediators of nitrosative stress remain for the
most part unknown. Trans-arachidonic acids (TAAs) are
recently described major products of NO2' radical-
mediated isomerization of arachidonic acid, and their
formation is enhanced by high CO2 levels; we explored
if and how TAAs reproduce biological effects of
nitrosative stress. TAAs are generated in our model of
retinal microangiopathy in vivo in a NO-dependent
manner. TAAs induced a selective time- and
concentration-dependent cell death of ECs in vitro, and
resulted in retinal microvascular degeneration ex and in
vivo. These effects are mediated by an upregulation of
the anti-angiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1),
independently of classic arachidonic acid metabolism;
accordingly, TAA-induced vasoobliteration was
prevented by selective neutralizing antibodies to TSP-1
as well as to its receptor CD-36. In summary, our
findings uncover previously undescribed mechanisms of
- 64 -
hypercapnia-induced cytotoxicity, specifically as it
pertains to nitrosative stress in microvascular injury, and
provide insight into therapeutic avenues in the
management of disorders involving nitrosative stress
such as ischemic retinopathies and possibly
encephalopathies commonly encountered in the
immature subject. Finally, the dogma regarding safety of
hypercapnia may need to be revisited.
PREVENTION OF RETINOPATHY OF
PREMATURITY

Memorial Hospital, Morristown, NJ, USA
Background and Aims: Oxygen was discovered more
than 200 years ago and it has been administered to more
infants in the world than any other neonatal treatment.
However, we still do not fully know how much is wise
to give or how much infants actually need in relation to
variations in illness and gestational and postnatal age.
“Too much oxygen” damages the retina and now we
know that it increases risk for serious illnesses like
cancer. In many places, and even in the recent literature,
there is a debate about using 21% O2 versus 100% or
‘pure’ oxygen during resuscitation. This practice cannot
be a correct practice for many infants, since it excludes
or limits a more reasonable practice, a practice based on
using an ‘adequate’ dose of oxygen (anywhere from
21% to 100%), assessing each infant’s needs with an
accurate pulse oximeter, targeting for an “acceptable”
SpO2 and using a blender to be able to administer the
needed oxygen dose for that target. Measuring FiO2 and
O2 saturation accurately with a state of the art monitor
which incorporates new technologies can today be done
routinely from the time of birth in preterm infants
treated through out the world. ROP is the most common
cause of blindness but many cases can be prevented by
practicing differently.
Methods: I will review in some detail how much we
know and do not know about oxygenation, alveolar gas
equation, normal PaO2 and O2 saturation when
breathing room air and when breathing oxygen. I will
also review pulse oximetry in neonatal medicine,
including the most important aspects of SpO2 and the
significant differences in saturation monitors in the
market. I will review our peer reviewed publications in
relation to prevention of ROP and oxygenation and
some related publications by other investigators.
Results: Many SpO2 monitors have high rates of false
alarms, are not accurate in eliminating noise, have
‘holding periods’ and are more sensitive to light and
motion artifacts, not functioning well when clinicians
need them the most. In addition, some monitors in the
market read 1.5% - 4% higher or lower than other
monitors, even in very stable conditions. Masimo SET
technology is the one with greater and most refined
accuracy to resolve most artifacts and to increase
sensitivity at low blood flow, pulse amplitude and blood
oxygenation values, ensuring better clinical care. More
than 90 manuscripts in peer reviewed journals are
evidence of the better sensitivity and specificity of this
technology. I will present data from our publications and
from unpublished work about how the practice of
avoiding hyperoxia (i.e.: SpO2 > 95% when breathing
O2) has been associated with markedly reduced rates of
ROP and also with less severe ROP. Avoiding
hyperoxia may also be beneficial for conditions like
BPD, periventricular leukomalacia, infection and cancer
and to avoid oxidative stress which influences apoptosis
and cell growth.
Conclusions: Some cases of ROP are associated to
inadequate practices and can be prevented by using
adequate SpO2 technology and by changing those
practices.

Background and Aims: Oxidative stress associated
with reoxygenation may be responsible for short and
long-term pathological consequences. Our aim was to
study the effect of acute hypoxia and reoxygenation
with room air or 40%, 60% or 100% oxygen upon
urinary markers of oxidative stress, which could be a
useful non-invasive tool for monitoring patients in the
clinical setting.
Methods: Piglets were asphyxiated following a
standardized model, and resuscitated with 21%, 40%,
60% or 100% oxygen. Once recovered and stabilized,
piglets were sacrificed. Urine samples were collected. 8-
oxo-DHG and 2DG as well as ortotyrosine and
phenylalanine were determined by mass spectrometry.
Results: Quotient of 8-oxo-DHG/2DG as well as o-
tyrosine/phenylalanine ratios were significantly higher
in piglets resuscitated with high oxygen concentrations
(DHG/DG: RAR 5.23 vs OXR100:18.5 microm/L; p<
0.01 and TYR/PHE: RAR 19.07 vs OXR100: 148.7
microm/L; p<0.001). Moreover there was a significant
correlation between the oxygen concentration used at
resuscitation and TYR/PHE ratio.
Conclusions: Acute hypoxia during asphyxia and the
use of high oxygen concentrations during resuscitation
cause oxidation of DNA and PHENYLALANINE.
These markers can be easily determined in urine and
may be useful as clinical tools in the follow-up of these
patients. TYR/PHE is especially sensible.

Background and Aims: Recent experimental studies
suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
can play an important role in the development of
retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The aim of the study
was analysis of: (1) correlation between serum
concentration of VEGF during the first month of life and
the risk of ROP (2) association of T (-460C) and G
(+405C) polymorphisms of VEGF gene with ROP.
Methods: 128 newborns with mean birthweight 1073g
were included into prospective study. Concentrations of
VEGF were measured by Elisa assay in the 2nd, 3rd and
4th weeks of life. Molecular studies of VEGF
polymorphisms were performed with PCR-RFLP and
RG-PCR. The infants were divided into 2 groups: A) no
ROP or ROP not requiring treatment (n=92) and 2) ROP
requiring lasertherapy (n=36).
Results: The serum VEGF concentrations were similar
in both groups. The frequency of VEGF -460 TT allele
was higher in the treated group (35 vs 24%; p=0,1).
Moreover, the VEGF serum concentrations were higher
in the TT carriers than TC or CC infants (898 vs 688
and 684pg/ml; p=0.02). The frequency of +405CC allele
was also higher (14 vs 5%; p=0.07) in the treated group,
but G (+405C) polymorphism did not influence VEGF
serum concentration. VEGF -460TT/+405CC haplotype
was more prevalent in the treated group (21 vs 2%;
p=0.016).
Conclusions: -460TT/+405CC allele carrier state can be
associated with the risk of progressive ROP and the
VEGF serum concentration is higher in the -460TT
carriers. (Study partially supported by State Committee

Background and Aims: NB breathing room air (RA)
have normal SpO2 of 95-100% but keeping SpO2
95-100% in NB breathing FiO2>21% can cause
hyperoxia. In 2003, we described that SpO2 85-95% is
associated with less morbidity. There is concern that
these SpO2 levels may cause persistent or intermittent
hypoxemia. Objective: to evaluate PaO2 at different
SpO2 levels in NB with arterial catheters.
Methods: Prospective comparison of PaO2 and SpO2 in
stable NB in 4 NICU’s of 2 countries. PaO2 obtained for
clinical indications; simultaneous SpO2 was recorded at
the time of the arterial gas. Comparisons were made
only in stable NB if the SpO2 changed <1% before,
during and after the collection of the sample. Statistics:
Chi square, Fishers, bivariate and multivariate analysis.
Results: 310 SpO2 values in 70 NB; 30% of the
samples from NB in RA. GA and BW: 26.5±2.2w and
900±280g. NB in RA: median SpO2 96% (88-100%);
with SpO2 85-93%, PaO2 was 51.9±8mmHg, median of
53 (39-65). When SpO2>94%, PaO2 was
65.1±17mmHg, median 64 (39-113). NB breathing
FiO2>21%: A) With SpO2 85-93%, PaO2 was
52.3±9mmHg, median 53 (29-83); PaO2 of 40-80mmHg
in > 90%. B) With SpO2>94%, PaO2 was
71.9±25mmHg, median 63 (38-164) (p 0.001vs infants
with SpO2 85-93%); 19% of the PaO2 values were
>85mmHg.
Conclusions: NB breathing FiO2>21%: I) Normoxemia
is more frequent with SpO2 85-93% than with
SpO2>94%; II) SpO2 85-93% avoids abnormally high
PaO2 and is infrequently associated with low PaO2;
III) SpO2 >94% is associated with hyperoxia, which
may be of risk in some NB receiving FiO2>21%.

Background and Aims: Antioxidant enyzme
expression matures in the last weeks of gestation. Thus,
extremely preterm infants are prone to reactive oxygen
derived lung injury. However, prenatal corticosteroids
(PCTS) improve postnatal adaptation in these infants.
We hypothesize that PCTS favor glutathione cycle
enzyme maturation and expression thus reducing
alveolar damage.
Methods: Premature infants <28 wks gestation
receiving (CORT; n=15) and not receiving NOCORT;
n=12) antenatal glucocorticoids were enrolled. In cord
blood samples and venous blood at 7 d postnatally total
erythrocyte GSH and GSSG, as well as GPx and
GReductase activities were determined by methods
previously described (Vento M el al JPediatr 2003).
Supplemental oxygen given was registered along the
study.
Results: CORT group had significantly higher
GSH/GSSG ratio at birth (p<0.01) and 1 week thereafter
(p<0.05) as compared to NOCORT group. Moreover,
GPx and GReductase activities where also higher in the
CORT group at birth (p<0.05) and one week thereafter
(p<0.05) than in the NOCORT group. The oxygen needs
for the CORT group was significantly lower than in the
NOCORT group at 7 days of life (p<0.05).
Conclusions: Prenatal corticosteroids activate
glutathione redox cycle improving postnatal adaptation
of extremely preterm infants.

Background and Aims: ROP is a two-phase disease in
which effects of hyperoxia, hypoxia and reactive O2
species (ROS) lead to abnormal retinal vascularization,
particularly in ELGANS. We hypothesized that the
highest risk ELGANS (<25wks) might benefit most
(largest effect size) from rhSOD reduction of ROS.
Effects on the smallest ELGANS may have been
obscured by the total cohort analysis performed in the
last rhSOD (Ferring) trial (for the prevention of
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in infants under
1250g (Pediatrics, 111:469, 2003)).
Methods: In that trial, 302 infants were randomized to
intratracheal (IT) rhSOD or placebo at birth and every
48h while intubated.
Results: IT administration was associated with
prolonged, increased serum (and theoretically
intraocular) levels. More rhSOD doses were given with
decreasing GA (longer intubation). ROP risk increased
with decreasing GA. Analysis of the entire cohort
revealed no significant differences in the incidence
(64% v. 60%) or the severity [worse than stage 2 (>S2)]
of ROP in placebo v. rhSOD treated infants. When a
more detailed sub-group analysis (Fisher’s exact test)
was performed on 72 infants <26wk, 66% of rhSOD
treated infants (n=38) developed ROP compared to 85%
in controls (n=34)(P=0.06). For infants <25wk (n=24),
40% of rhSOD and 85% of controls developed any ROP
(P=0.03)(>50% incidence reduction), and fewer rhSOD
treated infants had ROP >S2 (10%) compared to
controls (36%)(P=0.17).
Conclusions: This post-hoc analysis suggests rhSOD
treatment may reduce the incidence and severity of ROP
in the most premature infants (more doses with longer
intubattion). This has important implications in trials of
rhSOD to prevent BPD in high-risk ELGANs.
MICROCIRCULATORY ANALYSIS USING
SIDESTREAM DARK FIELD (SDF) IMAGING IN
SEPSIS
C Ince
Department of Physiology, Academic Medical Center,
University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands
Sublingual OPS (orthogonal polarization spectral)
imaging has revealed the central role of the
microcirculation in the pathophysiology, outcome and
treatment of sepsis by its ability to visualise the
microcirculation in great detail under clinical conditions.
Of particular importance in this context has been the
response of the smallest microvessels, the capillaries.
OPS imaging illuminates the tissues with polarized
green light and measures the reflected light from the
tissue surface after filtering out the polarized portion of
the reflected light. A clinical scoring system was
developed to quantify images in septic patients (1).
However OPS imaging was found to lacks sensitivity to
study in detail capillary kinetics and morphology. We
recently introduced SDF (Sidestream Dark Field)
imaging as a new way of clinical observation of the
microcirculation. In this modality a light guide imaging
the microcirculation is surrounded by light emitting
diodes (LED) of a wavelength (530nm) absorbed by the
hemoglobin of erythrocytes so that they can be clearly
observed as flowing cells. Covered by a disposable cap
the probe is placed on tissue surfaces. The light from the
concentrically placed LED's at the tip of the probe
directly penetrate deep into the tissue illuminating the
microcirculation. By not being in direct optical contact
with the sensing central core of the probe no direct
surface reflections interfere with the image of the
microcirculation and remarkable clear images can be
observed. The deeper sublingual arterioles as well as the
glcocalyx lining of the endothelial cells can also be
clearly observed. Improved image quality allows better
computer automatic analysis of the images and the low
energy requirement of SDF imaging further enhances its
utility by allowing battery and/or portable computer
operation. It is expected that SDF imaging will provide
an improved imaging modality of the microcirculation
in sepsis especially in pediatriatic patients 1. Boerma

UNRAVELING THE REACTIONS OF NITRIC
OXIDE, NITRITE AND HEMOGLOBIN IN
HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS
M T Gladwin
Department of Critical Care Medicine, National Heart
Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA
Nitric oxide (NO) plays a fundamental role in
maintaining normal vasomotor tone. Recent data
implicate a critical function for hemoglobin and the
erythrocyte in regulating the activity of NO in the
vascular compartment. Intravascular hemolysis releases
hemoglobin from the red blood cell into plasma (plasma
cell-free plasma Hemoglobin), which is then able to
scavenge endothelial derived NO 600-fold faster than
erythrocytic hemoglobin, thereby disrupting NO
homoestasis. This may lead to vasoconstriction,
decreased blood flow, platelet activation, increased
- 67 -
endothelin-1 expression (ET-1), and end-organ injury,
and thus suggesting a novel mechanism of disease for
hereditary and acquired hemolytic conditions such as
sickle cell disease and cardiopulmonary bypass. In
addition to providing an NO scavenging role in the
physiological regulation of NO-dependent vasodilation,
hemoglobin and the erythrocyte may deliver NO as the
hemoglobin deoxygenates. While this process has
previously been ascribed to S-nitrosated hemoglobin,
recent data from our laboratories suggest that
deoxygenated hemoglobin reduces nitrite to NO and
vasodilates the human circulation along the
physiological oxygen gradient. This newly described
role of hemoglobin as a nitrite reductase is discussed in
the context of blood flow regulation, oxygen sensing,
and nitrite-based therapeutics. Reiter CD, Wang X,

Background and Aims: Quantification of the cerebral
oxygenation in intensive care is relevant. Spatially
resolved near-infrared spectroscopy is suitable, but
accuracy is insufficient (1). Our aim was to quantify the
precision of the cerebral Tissue Oxygenation Index
(c-TOI) doing repeated measurements to see if
imprecision could explain the lack of accuracy.
Methods: Twenty-five mature and 37 premature infants
were examined using the NIRO300 oximeter
(Hamamatsu). The handheld optode was re-sited in
different parieto-temporal positions three to nine times
within 20 minutes. One-way ANOVA was used to
estimate variability.
Results: The mean age at study was 19±6 hours. GA
was 39.7±1.3 and 28.2±2.6 weeks and arterial oxygen
saturation 96±2.5% and 96±2.8%, respectively. 5/37 of
the premature infants were mechanically ventilated.
Mean c-TOI was 74.7± 7.8% and 74.6±8.5%. The
within-infant variation in the two groups was 5.8%
versus 5.2% (NS). The between-infants variation was
5.2% versus 6.9% (p<0.005).
Conclusions: The 5-6% precision of c-TOI was not
good taking the population standard deviation of 5-7%
into consideration and corresponds almost exactly to the
limits of agreement of +/-12% in reference (1). The
mean c-TOI was similar in the two groups, but the
between-infant variation in the premature group was
higher. This could reflect greater heterogeneity. Since c-
TOI is partly venous (2/3) and partly arteriel (1/3), an
arterial oxygen saturation of 96% and a c-TOI of 75%
corresponds to a venous saturation of 65%, which is
normal. This work has been supported by the Ludvig og

Background and Aims: Voltage-gated potassium
channels (Kv) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) have been
involved in several forms of human and experimental
pulmonary hypertension. We have reported that the
TXA2 analog U46619, via activation of TP receptors
and PKCz, inhibited Kv currents in rat pulmonary artery
(PA) smooth muscle cells, increased cytosolic calcium
and induced a contractile response in isolated rat and
piglet PA. Herein, we have analyzed the role of reactive
oxygen species in the signalling pathway.
Methods: U46619-evoked changes in contractility,
dichlorofluorescein fluorescence (an indicator of
intracellular hydrogen peroxide), and Kv currents (using
the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp
technique) were analyzed in adult rat PA.
Results: In rat PA, U46619 increased dichloro-
fluorescein fluorescence and this effect was prevented
by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin and by
polyethylenglycol-catalase (PEG-catalase, a membrane
permeable form of catalase). U46619 inhibited Kv
currents in native PASMC and these effects were
strongly inhibited by apocynin. The contractile
responses to U46619 in isolated pulmonary arteries were
inhibited by PEG-catalase and the NADPH oxidase
inhibitors DPI and apocynin. The membrane permeable
hydroperoxide t-butyl hydroperoxide also inhibited Kv
currents and induced a contractile response in PA.
Conclusions: Activation of NADPH oxidase and the
subsequent production of hydrogen peroxide are
involved in the Kv channel inhibition and the contractile
response induced by TP receptor activation in rat PA.

Background and Aims: The early diagnosis of neonatal
infection remains a challenge. Recent studies using
Optical Polarizated Spectral (OPS) imaging techniques,
have reported microcirculatory alterations in adult
patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. The
objective of this study was to compare microcirculatory
flow and vascular density between healthy (H) and sick
newborns (I) with neonatal infection.
Methods: We obtained prospectively OPS images from
the ear conch of 45 infants on their 1st, 2nd and 3rd day
of life. Infection was defined as IL-6>50pg/mL and
CRP>0,5 mg/dL. The OPS sequences were analyzed
off-line, blinded to clinical status of the infant, using a
semiquantitative assessment of flow based on the work
of De Backer and Boerma.
Results: In the 14 infants of group I the percentage of
vessels with impaired flow was significantly elevated
(mean I [95%CI]: 34% [20-47] vs. H: 9% [6-13]
p<0,0001) whereas the trend to lower vascular density
did not reach statistical significance (I: 6,1 [4,67 -
7,51]vs. H: 6,5 [5,12- 7,88] vessels/mm). Most episodes
of infection were not severe (geometrical mean of max.
CRP :1,4 [95%CI: 0,92- 2,2] mg/dL ; IL-6: 87,1 [16,8-
450,1] pg/mL). Birth weight an gestational age did not
differ between the groups.
Conclusions: Even in infants with mild to moderate
signs of infection, microcirculatory flow is impaired in a
large proportion of vessels early in the course of disease.
Since these changes can be easily recognized at the
external ear, an on-line evaluation of microcirculatory
flow could be an important screening tool for infection
in the future.

Background and Aims: There is abnormal peripheral
microvascular function in Pre-eclampsia (PE). We have
shown that fetal sex alters maternal microvascular
function. It is known that males dominate the poor
outcomes in PE (20). We hypothesised that neonatal
microvascular function would be altered following PE
and be further influenced by sex.
Methods: Peripheral microvascular responses were
examined using Laser Doppler flowmetry. Term control
infants (n=31) and infants of PE mothers (n=33) where
studied at 6 hours and days 1, 3, and 5-7. Baseline
perfusion and vasodilatory response to local thermal
stimulation and post-occlusive reperfusion were
measured.
Results: Baseline blood flow significantly increased
from 6 hours to 7 days of age in the PE group (Kruskal-
Wallis ANOVA, P<0.01). No temporal change was seen
in the controls. Within the PE group, male infants where
significantly more vasodilated than females at 6 hours
(median 13.5 vs 5.9 PU, P=0.0289) but not at 72 hours
of age. No sex-specific difference was observed in the
controls. No significant differences in vasodilatory
response to dynamic testing were observed in either
group at any time point or by sex.
Conclusions: Following PE infants vasodilate, but not
following normotensive pregnancy. The mechanisms of
microvascular dysfunction in PE are poorly understood
but circulating vasoconstictors play an important role.
These may also effect the fetal circulation. The observed
differences in microvascular function may be a release
phenomenon. In keeping with our previous work we
have demonstrated sex significantly influences
microvascular function. This could explain the excess of
male morbidity and mortality following PE.

Background and Aims: A prominent feature of sepsis
is dysfunction of the microcirculation, with impaired
perfusion and regional tissue oxygenation. Orthogonal
Polarisation Spectral imaging (OPS imaging) is a non-
invasive technique that has recently been developed for
the study of the microcirculation of mucous membranes
and the surface of solid organs. In adults this technique
has been proven valuable to predict organ failure and
mortality. The aim was to evaluate the feasibility of
OPS imaging in children and to determine baseline data
of the microcirculation and to evaluate microcirculation
in critically ill children.
Methods: The microvascular network of the oral
mucosa was studied. The effect of temperature, blood
pressure, hemoglobin concentration and pH were
studied. Baseline data were determined.
Results: We found a significant negative correlation
between age and the FCD. There were no significant
relationships between the FCD and temperature, blood
pressure and pH. Furthermore we evaluated the
microcirculation of critically ill children and the effect
of ECMO on the microcirculation.
Conclusions: Microcirculatory parameters of the oral
mucosa can be measured in absolute values in children
by OPS imaging. We have successfully determined
baseline data of the oral microcirculation, which could
serve as reference values for critically ill children. The
- 69 -
method has been proven useful and is a promising
research tool.

Background and Aims: This interactive session aims to
discuss and explore the roles and responsibilities of the
PICU and NICU nurse in caring for the dying child or
infant and their family. This important aspect of nursing
care challenges even the most experienced nurse. We
will share our experiences and generate ideas about best
practice through facilitation of audience participation.
Methods: The experience of caring for the dying infant
or child in the critical care setting is one which
challenges the multidisciplinary team greatly. At a time
of immense emotional distress, it is essential that the
nurse provides timely, compassionate and therapeutic
care for the patient and their family. Insensitive,
unhelpful and misguided care can have a lasting
negative impact on the grieving process for the family.
It is therefore essential that we provide the best care we
can to support the family during this difficult time.
Results: The presenters will share with you their
individual experiences and knowledge of caring for the
dying infant and child. The session will:
• Share the practical issues around caring for the dying
patient and their family.
• Explore the complex communication issues with the
patient, parents, siblings, family members and members
of the multidisciplinary team.
• Discuss the after care required for family members.
• Explore how we can best support and develop other
nurses and members of the multidisciplinary team in
providing best practice.
• Explore the legislative, spiritual, cultural, professional
and ethical issues around providing care in the UK and
The Netherlands.
Conclusions: The last section of this session will
concentrate on facilitating discussion and debate from
the European audience. Both presenters will collate the
generated ideas of good practice during the session and
conclude the session with a summary of best practice.
PARENTAL CHOICE IN PLACE OF DEATH:
GUIDELINES FOR TERMINAL EXTUBATION
OUTSIDE PICU
A P Anderson, F Craig
Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: To develop guidelines for
terminal extubation outside PICU.
Methods: Retrospective case review of four children
whose families have requested terminal extubation to
occur outside PICU. Key aspects of care were identified
along with difficulties encountered. Based on this
experience comprehensive guidelines were developed.
Results: Four families requested for terminal extubation
to occur outside PICU. One family chose to be at home
and two families chose to go to a hospice local to their
homes. The fourth family were unable to be
accommodated in their request due to difficulties with
local service provision. In all cases, local services
requested PICU staff to perform the terminal extubation.
Aspects of care highlighted when considering terminal
extubation outside PICU were divided into five key
areas:
1. Availability of PICU resources for transfer.
2. Planning for anticipated symptoms including
medication and education of families and local staff;
particularly if death is not imminent on extubation.
3. Availability and experience of local medical and
nursing services.
4. The training needs, supervision and clinical
competence of PICU staff to provide terminal
extubation outside normal working environment.
5. Making provision for care and place of care after
death.
Conclusions: Extubation outside PICU is a feasible
option and it is hoped that with the guidelines
developed, more families will be able to benefit from
this option. When a child's death is inevitable, the focus
of hope changes, the how, when and where becomes
important.

Background and Aims: Care of children at the end of
life involves ethical dilemmas and difficult decisions.
Empirical research on these decisions focuses
predominantly on the physicians' role. Little is known
about the role of the pediatric nurses. This paper reports
the findings of a study that evaluates the attitude of
nurses regarding end-of-life decisions in children. The
study also reports their involvement in the decision-
making process and their participation in the
accomplishment of the decision.
Methods: Anonymous questionnaire was send to nurses
working in 5 different pediatric intensive care settings,
in Belgium.
Results: 63% of the nurses completed their
questionnaire. 84% of them were confronted at least
once with end-of-life decision the last 2 years and 73%
wanted to be involved in making the decision of end-of-
life. 66% of the nurses played an active role in the
preparation as well as the accomplishment of the
decision. 60% of the nurses assisted the physician in the
accomplishment of the decision, 50% carried out the
decision themselves in the presence of the physician.
Almost the majority of the respondent nurses (92%)
- 70 -
state that in certain situations it would be preferable not
further to treat the child, 6% of the respondents would
never participate in any type of end-of-life decision in
children.
Conclusions: The majority of the nurses were
confronted with end-of-life decisions in children. 66%
played an active role in the accomplishment of the
decision, but only 50% of them were involved in the
decision-making process.

Background and Aims: An individual peer support
network could be an effective intervention to help
parents deal with the stress of having a baby in the
NICU. This study aims to assess the stress of parents
while their infants are in the NICU and to evaluate the
effectiveness, in alleviating stress, of a parent to parent
support program.
Methods: Mothers of infants with a birth weight
< 1500g were randomized to a control or an intervention
group. Those in the intervention group were paired with
volunteer parents who had previously had a premature
infant. These volunteers were trained according to the
Parent Partners Listener Training Program (George
Washington University). Both groups answered the
NICU Family Needs Inventory (NFNI) and the Parental
Stressor Scale (PSS) during the first and sixth weeks
after admission to NICU. Outcome data were analyzed
in an intention to treat basis using T-test.
Results: The PSS scores were significantly higher after
six weeks when compared with base line (2.9+0.9 vs
2.4+0.7, p = 0.006). There were not statistically
significant differences in PSS (3.0+0.8 vs 2.7+0.9) or
NFNI scores (2.9+1.1 vs 2.6+1.1) between the control
and intervention groups after six weeks.
Conclusions: These results demonstrated that the stress
level of mothers of premature infants increases after the
infant have been in the NICU for a few weeks. The
parent support program was not effective in decreasing
the level of parental stress during this initial period of
maternal adaptation to the NICU. Studies to measure the
long-term effects of this intervention are needed.

MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY: NEONATAL
ADAPTATION OF THE MAJOR FIRST LINE
DEFENCE SYSTEM
P Brandtzaeg

Immunopathology (LIIPAT), Institute of Pathology,
University of Oslo, Rikshospitalet University Hospital,
Oslo, Norway
The vast majority of immunological challenges
confronting the body make contact with mucosal
surfaces, including infectious agents and foreign
proteins. To maintain homeostasis in the extensive and
vulnerable mucosae, they are protected by specialized
mechanisms of immune protection. Numerous genes are
involved in the regulation of both innate (natural) and
adaptive (acquired) immunity, with a variety of
modifications introduced over million of years. Two-
layered adaptive mucosal immunity: In the process of
evolution, the mucosal immune system has generated
two layers of non-inflammatory defence: (i) immune
exclusion performed by secretory IgA antibodies to
modulate or inhibit surface colonization of
microorganisms and dampen penetration of potentially
dangerous soluble factors; and (ii) suppressive
mechanisms to avoid local and peripheral
hypersensitivity to innocuous antigens, particularly food
proteins and components of commensal bacteria. When
induced via the gut, the latter phenomenon is called 'oral
- 71 -
tolerance', which appears be a rather robust adaptive
immune function in view of the fact that large amounts
of food proteins pass through the gut, while overt and
persistent food allergy is not so common. Neonatal
immune adaptation: The neonatal period is particularly
critical, both with regard to infections and priming for
allergic disease. This is so because the mucosal barrier
function and the immunoregulatory network are poorly
developed for a variable period after birth, and
successful neonatal immune adaptation to exogenous
stimuli is crucial to health. Notably, mucosal
homeostasis depends on appropriate microbial
colonization as well as adequate timing and dose of
foreign food proteins when first introduced in the diet.
Dendritic cells are 'decision makers' in the immune
system when they perform their antigen-presenting
function, thus linking innate and adaptive immunity by
sensing the exogenous impact (e.g. conserved microbial
molecular patterns) on the mucosa. A balanced
indigenous microbiota is apparently required to drive the
normal development of both mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue and the secretory IgA system as well as
mucosally induced tolerance mechanisms such as the
generation of regulatory T cells. Moreover, the
properties of dendritic cells also appear to be influenced
by dietary factors such as vitamin A. Other dietary
factors including lipids, particularly the polyunsaturated
n-3 fatty acids in fish oil, can likewise in several ways
have a beneficial effect on the developing
immunophenotype of the infant. The same is true for
breast milk, which provides both immunoregulatory
factors and secretory antibodies reinforcing the infant's
mucosal barrier.
MECHANISM OF ALLERGIC SENSITIZATION:
THE HYGIENE HYPOTHESIS
E Isolauri
Department of Paediatrics, University of Turku, Finland
Background and Aims: The hygiene hypothesis
conceives the increase in atopic disease to be related to
reduced exposure to microbes early in life.
Methods: The Nutrition, Allergy, Mucosal Immunology
and Intestinal Microbiota (NAMI) research group has
evaluated the host-microbe interaction in performing
studies on:
1. The Association: Mode of delivery-gut microbiota-
risk of atopic disease.
2. Clinical Intervention: Probiotics in nutritional
management/ risk reduction of atopic disease.
3. Mechanisms: Probiotic / microbiota effects /
Pathogenesis of disease.
Results: The microbial provocation is originally
obtained from the mother. How the microbiota is
originated, depends on genetics, mode of delivery, early
feeding strategies and the hygienic conditions. The
NAMI research group has provided evidence for an
extended hygiene hypothesis. This unifying theory that
early and constant microbial stimulus from the gut
microbiota may outweigh that of occasional infections
provides an explanation for the simultaneous increase of
autoimmunity and inflammatory bowel disease (TH1
mediated) and allergic diseases (TH2 mediated).
Specific strains of the healthy gut microbiota
(probiotics) were shown to counter allergy by generation
of anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 and transforming
growth factor-beta produced by Tr1- and TH3 cells,
respectively, which have a vital role both in suppression
of TH2-induced allergic inflammation, induction of oral
tolerance, and IgA production, an indispensable
component of the mucosal immune defence. The
probiotic effects in atopic disease have been attributed
to restoration to normal of increased intestinal
permeability and unbalanced gut microbiota,
improvement of the intestine's immunological barrier
functions, and reduced generation of proinflammatory
cytokines characteristic of local and systemic allergic
inflammation. Gut microbiota provide again
maturational signals for the gut-associated lymphoid
tissue, particularly for the IgA plasma cells, conferring
the first line of host immunological defence. Probiotics
have also been show to exert distinct effects on antigen
transport, depending on the food matrix, for example the
quality of protein in the diet. In a rodent model mucosal
transport of degraded macromolecules has been found to
be stimulated when Lactobacillus GG is administered
together with unhydrolyzed protein, but reduced when
administered with hydrolyzed protein. Such protein may
thus stimulate the humoral immunity in the gut, but also
affect on the induction of oral tolerance, as antigen
degradation is an indispensable component in the
acquisition of mucosal tolerance. Moreover,
polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to affect
the growth and adhesion of probiotics, and the
protective effect of probiotics appear to evolve in joint
action with the dietary intake of particular nutrients
reducing the risk of allergic disease. These advances
have prompted enthusiasm in the scientific community
and food industry and have fuelled research activities
currently focusing firstly on identification of specific
strains with anti-allergenic potential, and secondly on
the question how food matrix and dietary content
interact with the most efficacious probiotic strains.
Conclusions: Taken together, probiotic effects
evidently act cooperatively with other nutritional
compounds. In the future, the properties of specific
probiotics, and their combinations, in an optimal food
matrix, might be exploited in the development of
specific prophylactic and therapeutic interventions.
CHANGE IN NURSING PRACTICE STARTS
WITH YOU!
W De Groot-Bolluijt
GrootBolwerk, Maasdijk, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Nursing is an innovative and
dynamic profession. Since the early days of Florence
Nightingale, nursing practice has changed dramatically
in order to provide better care and improve the outcome
of the patient’s illness. The latest development in
nursing is the change towards evidence based practice.
Knowing the newest developments does not seem to be
sufficient for making a change effective. Providing
knowledge by education, training and symposia does
often not have the required results. Change Management
gives realization in different aspects necessary for
- 72 -
implementing an innovation. The aim of this workshop
is to present the Change Work Model to obtain practical
skills for a successful implementation of innovations.
Methods: The Change Work Model is based on
concepts of various theories of change management and
learning styles. In addition, unit culture and innovation
techniques are also incorporated in this model. The
assumptions of the concepts within the Change Work
Model are based on the available literature and are
connected within a framework in the set up of the
Change Work Model. The model is based on the
assumption that before implementing an innovation,
nurses have to know the different aspects of change.
How they experience there own role and learning styles,
the culture of there working place and what they expect
from innovation. After the explanation of the theory, the
participants will work with checklists based on the
different aspects with examples from daily practice. The
Change Work Model will lead nurses to become aware
of their own role and learning styles, recognise the
impact of the organization's culture and to identify
recommendations to implement change.
Results: With the Change Work Model different aspects
will be important for innovation towards the daily
practice. Changing can not only be done through
projects in the entire organisation. The workshop
sustains working with changes on an individual level
and makes the own role of the nurse clear. It also offers
tools to work with in a team. As a result, nurses obtain a
better understanding of the mechanics and processes
involved in innovation. They can use the different
aspects of change and this will help them to work on
innovation and successful change. Consequently the
patient will benefit from any quality improvement in
nursing practice.
Conclusions: The Change Work Model guides nurses
through a systematic process of change to implement
innovations into practice. This model is based on a
framework of change management theory, research and
clinical experience. The Model is a practical guidance
for the individual nurses and applicable in every unit
regardless the unit culture. In the rapid changing world
of PICU and NICU, nurses need to develop their
practice and account for their roles in changing practice.
The infants and children on the NICU and PICU will
benefit from our attitude. Change in nursing practice
starts with you!

Background and Aims: The need for family support in
intensive care unit is well documented (1). Parents have
always offered uniquely understanding support in shared
situations. They have an altruistic desire to help others
or' give back' into the setting which has had enormous
impact on their family. In partnership with
professionals, parents can use this compassion and
experience, if trained and supported properly, to help
other families. In line with government Patient and
Public Involvement Strategies and feedback from our
intensive care family group a Parent Telephone Support
Network (PTSN) was developed and supported by
hospital trust management. The aim of the service is to
provide unique support for anyone directly affected by
an admission to intensive care. Using this to
complement the multidisciplinary psychosocial support
already offered, thus enhancing the wider support
mechanisms available for families.
Methods: Fifteen parents/carers participated in initial
training sessions consisting of simulated phone calls,
useful skills and helpful strategies to provide confidence
in providing this support.
Results: There are three PTSN sessions a week when
callers can be connected to a supporter. Supervision and
support is provided by the Family Liaison Sisters. Initial
feedback from users and supporters is excellent.
Conclusions: Future aims are to expand the service by
increasing the number of sessions that are offered.

Street Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: The hospitalisation of a child
in intensive care is known to be a stressful experience
for parents that may affect family functioning. However,
little is known about the time course and the
relationships between parental stress and the child's
actual or expected recovery. This research project was
conducted to investigate pre- and post-operative parental
stress and to examine the influencing factors during the
postoperative period.
Methods: An exploratory, descriptive study was
undertaken, using triangulation of methods, to explore
parental stress, expectations and perceptions regarding
their child's recovery from cardiac surgery. Structured
interviews were conducted with the parents of 117
children pre-operatively and on days 1, 3, 5, 8 and 15
postoperatively (whilst child still in hospital). Parents
independently completed a validated parent stressor
scales.
Results: Parent stress remained high throughout their
child's hospitalisation, regardless of severity of illness.
The main themes of parents' expressed concerns were:
Parental expectations/perceptions versus actual illness;
Changing perceptions over time; and dominance of
parental concerns for their child over their own
concerns. There were few differences between mothers'
and fathers' concerns. Parents whose children had no
previous surgery voiced more concerns regarding pain
and discomfort, whereas parents of children who had
undergone previous surgery were more concerned with
complications and physical issues. Parents born outside
- 73 -
the UK whose first language was not English had higher
stress levels and more concerns.
Conclusions: These findings indicate the negative
impact of children's surgery and intensive care
hospitalisation on parents and identify specific areas for
interventions to improve parental support and coping.
THE FETAL ORIGINS OF INSULIN
RESISTANCE AND THE METABOLIC
SYNDROME
C Lévy-Marchal
INSERM U690, Robert Debré Hospital, Paris, France
Over the past fifteen years, a large body of studies has
evidenced the relation between SGA (small for
gestational age) and the increased risk of insulin-
resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases
later in life. The first reports focused on elderly and in
populations where the prevalence of diabetes is already
high. The association with insulin resistance and the
metabolic syndrome was later extended to young adults
and to prepubertal children. Our research programme is
based on a large community-based cohort where all
subjects were carefully selected on birth data and
gathers 734 SGA subjects (birth weight < 10th
percentile) and 886 AGA (adapted for gestational age)
subjects (25 < BW <75 perc.) born 1971-85. In these
adults born SGA, we have reported a number of
malfunctions of the adipose tissue persisting after
puberty (22 yr. old) suggesting an abnormal adipose
tissue which could participate to insulin-resistance and
the metabolic syndrome : - They show an excess of fat
mass, preferentially abdominal, without obesity - Insulin
action on lipolysis is reduced and FFA release is not
suppressed under physiological insulin concentrations -
An excessive lipolysis in response to catecholamines
was observed by microdialysis of the abdominal adipose
tissue - Leptin levels show an impaired regulation
during catch-up and are low in adults - Adiponectin
levels are low and the and insulin-sensitizing action is
impaired. - Pro12Ala of PPAR actually enhances IR in
the SGA individuals whereas it shows a insulin-
sensitizing effect in AGA's, attesting for a real
interaction with the fetal environment. and this
observation has been replicated in two independent
cohorts At the same time the different features of MS
(hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose
tolerance) were manifested in these SGA subjects and
were clustering around IR. However, the phenotype was
mild meaning that the differences between the subjects
born SGA and their pairs born adapted for gestational
age (AGA) were indeed significant for all features but of
low magnitude. As a matter of fact, the proportion of
disorders of glucose tolerance was low but twice as high
in SGA in comparison to AGA (3.8% vs 1.6%) and that
of MS six fold higher (2.3% vs 0.4%). We hypothesize
that the adipose tissue, which is a major target of fetal
growth restriction, is a key-tissue responsible for the
metabolic complications and that the process extends
beyond the perinatal period and continues to evolve in
adults.
CONTROLLED TRIAL OF EARLY LOW-DOSE
HYDROCORTISONE TREATMENT IN
PREVENTION OF BRONCHOPULMONARY
DYSPLASIA IN PRETERM INFANTS: A TWO-
YEAR FOLLOW-UP

Department of Pediatrics, University of Oulu, Finland
Background and Aims: Dexamethasone treatment is
associated with increased the risk of cerebral palsy (CP)
among VLBW infants. Early hydrocortisone (HC)
treatment may decrease the incidence of BPD, but no
follow up studies have been published so far. Here we
present the first preliminary results.
Methods: 51 infants enrolled in a blinded, controlled
trial evaluating the effectiveness of postnatal early HC
treatment in prevention of BPD were reviewed.
According to present results the infants who had low
cortisol values before the supplementation had less
severe respiratory course and lower incidence of BPD;
however, the infant with high endogenous cortisol had
no benefit (J Pediatrics 2005). Here we report the results
of physical growth and neurodevelopmental outcome at
corrected age of two years.
Results: The growth characteristics were similar in both
groups. The mean IQ evaluated by Griffiths
Developmental Scale was 94.8 ± 21.2 in BM and 99.2 ±
12.4 in placebo groups (P=0.45). The mean IQ was 97.3
± 6.8 in BM and 95.9 ± 14.9 in placebo group among
infants with low cortisol values (stimulated cortisol <
270 nmol/l) after birth (P=0.95). The mean IQ was 91.6
± 26.9 in BM and 100.1 ± 12.6 in placebo group among
infant with high cortisol values after birth (P=0.82).
Conclusions: Early low dose HC had no detectable
effect on the growth or neurologic outcome at 2 years of
adjusted age. The sample size was not calculated to find
a difference. We propose that in subsequent trials
studying the efficacy and safety of HC supplementation,
there is a need to analyze endogenous cortisol levels.
HC or placebo (HC 2.0 mg/kg i.v. divided into three
doses for 2 days, 1.5 mg/kg i.v. at 8-hour intervals for 2
days and 0.75 mg/kg i.v. divided into two doses for 6
days.

Background and Aims: Chorioamnionitis and fetal
systemic inflammation are associated with a reduction in
respiratory distress syndrome but an increase in
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD has been
associated with an impaired lung development marked
by a rearrangement of elastin deposition. We
hypothesized that elastin was part of the structural
changes induced by inflammation after intravenous
E.coli endotoxin injection into fetal sheep.

Methods: Fetal sheep were chronically instrumented at
107d gestational age and delivered at 117d (term 147d).
The control group (n=6) received saline injection and
the study group (n=7) 100ng endotoxin intravenously.
Lung tissues were stained for nuclear factor (NF)-
kappaB for proinflammatory gene transcription, for
surfactant protein B (SP-B) for maturation and for
elastin for structural remodeling. Staining intensity was
analyzed in a four step semi-quantative scale.
Results: NF-kappaB was detected in the nucleus of
endothelial cells after endotoxin (median 3; interquartile
range 2.7 – 3.5; p<0.05 versus 1;0.4 – 1.6; in controls).
SP-B was detected in alveolar type II cells in the
endotoxin group (3;2.3-3.6; p<0.05 versus 1;0.6 – 2.2 in
controls). Elastin was stained around pulmonary blood
vessels in both control and endotoxin group. Elastin
fibers were detected in alveolar crests after intravenous
endotoxin but in not the control group.
Conclusions: Intravenous injection of endotoxin caused
inflammation and maturation in the fetal lungs. Elastin
fiber deposition in the fetal lung indicated fetal lung
injury and remodeling. These early, strictly intra-
uterinely induced changes may be a considerate
predisposing step to the postnatal development of BPD.

Background and Aims: Recent studies have shown that
low birth weight infants are at risk of increased arterial
blood pressure (ABP) in adulthood. Previous works
from our centre and others suggest that ABP and arterial
stiffness (AS) are increased in adolescents who were
born preterm. Study aims were to characterize AS and
ABP in young adults who were born preterm with an
appropriate birth weight for gestational age compared to
a control group born at term with an appropriate birth
weight.
Methods: Systemic ABP was measured with an
automated oscillometric device. AS was estimated by
pulse wave velocity (PWV) between carotid and radial
arteries. Increased PWV was considered to correspond
to increased AS.
Results: 32 adults were studied at a mean (SD) age of
20.8 (1.5) years. Gestational age of adults who were
born preterm was 32.6 (2.2) gestation weeks. They had a
significantly higher systolic (122 ±13 vs. 112±8 mmHg,
p<0.01), mean (89±5 vs. 85±4 mmHg, p<0.05) and
diastolic blood pressure (69±4 vs. 65±4 mmHg p<0.05),
and a significantly increased pulse pressure (53±11 vs.
46 ±7 mmHg, p<0.05) and PWV (7±0.8 vs. 6.4±0.8 m/s,
p<0.05).
Conclusions: Young adults whose low birth weight is
due to preterm birth have increased ABP and AS. It can
be speculated that preterm birth is involved in the early
programming of arterial disease in adulthood through
increased AS.

Background and Aims: Low birth weight is associated
with increased risk of cardiovascular disease,
hypertension and type 2 diabetes in adulthood.
Mechanisms are incompletely known. DNA methylation
may be a common link underlying the association
between adverse fetal growth and elevated risk of later
chronic diseases. We aimed at determining the
methylation profiles of IGF2, H19 (epigenetically
deregulated domains in Beckwith-Wiedeman syndrome)
and PEG1/MEST DMRs (Differentially Methylated
Regions) in placental tissues of pregnancies complicated
by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and
uncomplicated pregnancies.
Methods: Placental villi samples and maternal
peripheral blood lymphocytes were obtained from IUGR
pregnancies and controls (n = 17, n = 30, respectively),
after informed consent. Protocols for the study were
approved by the institutional Ethics Committee.
Bisulfite conversion and pyrosequencing technology
were used to characterize individual specific
methylation profiles in the IGF2, H19 and PEG1/MEST
DMRs.
Results: In H19-IGF2 domain, specific methylation
profiles were similar in maternal bloods cells and
placental villi samples. However, average methylation
in this cluster appeared decreased in placenta villi
samples of IUGR pregnancies versus controls at full
term gestation. Similar results were observed on some
CpG dinucleotide for PEG1/MEST DMR.
Conclusions: Differential methylation profiles affect
IGF2, H19 and PEG1/MEST genes in IUGR
pregnancies. Early nutritional status may influence the
regulation of imprinted genes. DNA methylation
modifications may induce persistent dysregulation of
gene expression and be involved in the pathogenic
process underlying early programming of later diseases
in low birth weight infants.

Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Division of the Russian
Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk, Russia
Background and Aims: In this study, we used mice,
with targeted deletion of the tachykinin 1 (TAC1 -/-)
gene, lacking neurokinin A (NKA) and substance P
(SP). Especially SP is known to be involved in
respiratory rhythm and pattern generating mechanisms.
Methods: We employed in vivo and in vitro approaches
to study hypoxic response and changes in
chemosensitivity in knock-out mice vs. wild type (WT).
In vivo, the effects of intermittent hypoxia (IH) and
moderate hypercapnia, were studied using whole-body
flow plethysmoraphy at postnatal days 2-3 and 8-10. In
vitro, anoxic responses, as well as the effects of
hypocapnic and hypercapnic conditions were
investigated in brainstem-spinal cord preparation at
postnatal day 2.
Results: In vivo, an attenuated hypoxic response to IH
in knock-out animals (postnatal day 8-10) was observed.
Moreover, sigh activity was also considerably affected
during IH in both age groups, demonstrating
significantly stronger increase in knock-out mice. As
with in vivo, there were no differences between TAC1 -
/- and WT mice in in vitro anoxic frequency responses.
However, in TAC1 -/- mice, the burst amplitude
reduction during the anoxic response was significantly
more resilient and the recovery period, when the burst
amplitude was restored after the initial part of anoxic
response, was significantly shorter as compared to WT
mice. Conclusions: Thus, our data suggest that
deficiency in SP and NKA, considerably modify the
respiratory rhythm and pattern generating networks in
mice and is particularly affecting the respiratory
behaviour during hypoxia. This data contributes to the
understanding of disorders such as SIDS.

Background and Aims: Cerebral circulation is
pressure-passive in LBWI with ESH who receive VPS
(Pellicer et al, Pediatrics 2005). VPS is controversial as
was associated with severe periventricular hemorrhage
(PVH). There is no prospective information on VPS and
morbidity. Objectives: Prospective study to evaluate the
influence of ESH and VPS on neurodevelopment.
Methods: LBWI with ESH (<24h of life) (group S)
were assigned randomly to receive dopamine (2.5-10
g/kg/ min) or epinephrine (0.125-0.5 g/kg/ min) in
stepwise manner until target blood pressure was attained
(treatment success, subgroup TS). Controls (C) were
patients without ESH who had parental consent.
Outcome measures: cerebral ultrasound (CUS) up to 40
wk, structured neurological evaluation (every 3 months)
and neurodevelopmental test at 2-3 years.
Results: 130 patients were included (S=60, TS=38;
C=71). 16 infants died; follow-up rate was 88%. Group
S had lower birth weight and GA than group C (p<.001).
Groups did not differ with respect to initial CUSs;
however, final CUSs revealed higher rates of severe
PVH in group S (p<.05), and higher rates of normal
CUS in group C (p<.01). Only the latter remained when
subgroup TS and group C were compared (p<.01).
Multivariate analysis showed no association between
final CUS and VPS. No differences were found on
neurological exams or adverse outcome (death or
cerebral palsy or severe neurodevelopmental delay)
between groups.
Conclusions: Cautious use of VPS to treat ESH in
LBWI appears safe. Appropriate study designs should
address whether bringing systemic blood pressure to a
normal range will improve outcome.

On Behalf of The
Dutch POPS-19 Collaborative Study Group
Background and Aims: Infants born very preterm or
with low very low birthweight are at increased risk of
cognitive deficits. Follow-up data into young adulthood
however are scarce. We examined the impact of
prematurity, intrauterine growth, and environment on
cognitive function in young adults born very preterm or
with very low birthweight. Methods: A cohort of 562
(59%) infants born in the Netherlands in 1983 (POPS
study) before 32 weeks of gestation and/or with
birthweight less than 1,500 gram had cognitive
assessment at age 19 years. Results: The cohort’s mean
IQ was 100.2 (SD15.0) and did not differ from that in
the Dutch norm sample. Adjusted for the other factors,
children with a handicap at age 5 (8.8% of participants)
scored 17.0 mean IQ points lower at age 19 years.
Participants with high-educated parents scored 11.4
mean IQ points higher than those with low-educated
parents. One SD more in birthweight resulted in 2.5 and
one week in gestational age in 1.2 mean IQ points more.
Males scored 4.0 mean IQ points higher than females
and participants born of younger mothers scored 3.0
- 76 -
mean IQ points lower than those born of mothers aged
25-30 years. Conclusions: Intrauterine growth,
prematurity, environment and neonatal complications
are of predictive value for later cognitive function.
Infants at high biological risk can compensate for their
cognitive impairment in a stimulating environment and
the good cognitive outcome at young adulthood in these
survivors from the early neonatal intensive care era
seems mainly due to socioeconomic advantages of the
Dutch society, representative for most Western
societies.

Background and Aims: To investigate the impact of
perinatal brain injury associated with cystic white matter
damage (WMD) on the developing preterm brain, we
analyzed biomarkers specific for inflammatory
responses in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of preterm
infants who develop post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus
(PHHC).
Methods: 22 preterm infants with PHHC undergoing
serial reservoir puncture were included in the study.
Patients were grouped according to the diagnosis of
signs of cystic WMD on ultrasound at day 28 postnatal
age (pna). Group A: 9 infants with PHHC without signs
of cystic WMD (median gestational age 27+5 weeks).
Group B: 13 infants with PHHC and cystic WMD
(median gestational age 27+3 weeks). Samples were
analyzed at first ventriculostomy (median day 26 pna).
16 age-matched preterm infants with lumbar puncture
for the exclusion of meningitis served as controls. CSF
concentrations of IL-1beta, IL-18 and IFN-gamma were
analysed using ELISA.
Results: Table 1.
Conclusions: IL-1beta and IL-18 seem to be involved in
a chronic inflammatory process in patients with PHHC.
IFN-gamma levels in the CSF may specifically
distinguish the inflammatory process taking place in
WMD from that in PHHC and serve as a clinical marker
of cystic WMD.
NEWLY EMERGING VIRAL INFECTIONS
A D M E Osterhaus
Department of Virology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The
Netherlands
In the past century, pandemic outbreaks of influenza and
AIDS have cost the lives of tens of millions of people.
These events were all caused by multiple introductions
of animal viruses - influenza A viruses and SIV of birds
and non-human primates respectively - into the human
population. Besides these introductions causing major
pandemics in humans, a large number of other virus
infections have spilled over from animal reservoirs to
humans or other susceptible species, resulting in
considerable morbidity and mortality as 'virgin soil'
epidemics. The most recent examples in humans are the
introduction of SARS coronavirus and influenza A
viruses (H5N1 and H7N7) from the animal world, which
caused global concern about their potential to be at the
origin of new pandemics. Over the last decades there
seems to be a dramatic increase in the emergence or re-
emergence of virus threats in humans and animals
worldwide. A long list of exotic names like Ebola,
Lassa, Rift-Valley, Crimea-Congo, Hendra, Nipah and
West-Nile is the illustration of names of just some of the
places associated with the origin of viruses that crossed
the species boundary to humans, with dramatic
consequences in the last ten years alone. Similarly,
recent mass mortalities among wild aquatic and
terrestrial mammals caused by previously known and
newly discovered morbiliviruses, as well as outbreaks of
hog cholera, foot-and-mouth disease and fowl plague
among domestic animals, highlight this trend. Although
improved detection and surveillance techniques, as well
as increased media attention may have contributed to
our perception of an increase in the incidence of
outbreaks of virus infections, it is becoming more and
more clear that major changes in our modern society
increasingly create new opportunities for virus
infections to emerge: a complex mix of changes in
social environments, medical and agricultural
technologies and ecosystems continues to create new
niches for viruses to cross species boundaries and to
rapidly adapt to new species. In combating this global
threat, we should make optimal use of the new tools
provided by the unprecedented advances made in the
research areas of virology, molecular biology,
immunology, epidemiology, genomics and
bioinformatics. Serious investment in these areas in the
future will not only be highly cost-effective but will also
save many lives of humans and animals. In addition,
better collaboration and coordination between all the
stakeholders is urgently needed, to establish early
warning systems and effective preparedness plans.

Background and Aims: Physician-diagnosed uro-
genital tract infections in pregnancy are associated with
low birth weight and premature birth. The aims of this
study were to assess the association of subjective
urogenital complaints in different trimesters of
pregnancy with birth weight and gestational age.
Methods: This study was embedded in the Generation
R Study, a population-based prospective cohort study
from fetal life until adulthood in Rotterdam, The
Netherlands (2002-2006). Urogenital complaints were
assessed by questionnaires in each trimester in pregnant
women. Complaints were categorized in mild urethral
complaints, mild vaginal complaints and more severe
complaints (bleeding after sexual intercourse, non-
painful ulceration, enlarged lymph nodes in the groin).
Birth outcomes were obtained from midwife and
hospital registries. The present analysis was based on
6,680 prenatally included women with complete
records.
Results: In the first trimester mild urethral and more
severe complaints were associated with a decrease in
birth weight in the offspring of -33 (95% confidence
interval (CI): -70,-3) and -66 (95% CI:-107,-24) grams
respectively, after adjustment for gestational age,
ethnicity and education of the mother. We did not find
any associations for mild vaginal complaints. Having
four or more complaints was associated with a decrease
in birth weight of -53 (95% CI:-96,-11) grams. For
urethral complaints, similar associations were found in
the second and third trimester. There was no effect on
gestational age.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that having
urethral or more severe complaints during pregnancy
seems to have an adverse effect on birth weight in the
offspring.

and Italian Neonatal Network, Lecco, Italy
Background and Aims: To estimate incidence and non-
nutritional risk factors for NEC.
Methods: Analysis of a cohort of 2135 VLBWI infants,
born in Lombardy (Italy) in 1999-2002 and admitted to
14 Intensive Care Units, participating to the Network
Neonatale Lombardo. Mean GA was 29.3 weeks; mean
birthweight was 1101 g. Definitions of the Vermont-
Oxford network, including NEC definition, were used.
Logistic models (adjusting for GA, congenital
anomalies, birthweight < 10 centile, twinning, 1-minute
Apgar, sex, type of delivery, location of birth) were used
to estimate and test the association of factors with NEC.
Results: NEC incidence was 3.2% overall (2.0%
'medical' NEC, 1.2% 'surgical'); frequency was higher at
low GA: 10.1% at 23-26 weeks vs 2.6% at 27-29. A
wide variation was observed among different units
(from 0 to 7%). Risk factors for NEC were late-onset
sepsis (Odds Ratio: 6.05; 95%CI: 3.18-11.50) and patent
ductus arteriosus (OR: 2.05; CI: 1.10-3.82), while
mechanical ventilation failed to reach statistical
significance (OR: 2.47; CI: 0.95-6.41, P=0.062). Use of
surfactant (OR: 0.42; CI: 0.19-0.91) and umbilical
venous catheter (OR: 0.37; CI: 0.18- 0.75) were
negatively associated to NEC. Neonates with NEC
experienced a 3-fold increase in mortality (33.3% vs
10.3, without difference between medical and surgical
NEC), and had a longer length-of-stay in the hospital
(average increase 13 days, adjusted for confounders and
procedures).
Conclusions: Many non-nutritional factors influence
NEC incidence. NEC frequency varies among neonatal
units, perhaps reflecting different nutritional and non-
nutritional policies. Our data confirm that NEC has an
impact on mortality and length-of-stay in VLBWI.

Background and Aims: Mitochondrial haplotype H is
common in European populations and associated with
improved survival and higher core temperatures in
adults with gram-negative sepsis (Baudouin et al.
Mitochondrial DNA and survival after sepsis: a
prospective study. Lancet 2005; 366:2118-2199).
Methods: Genotyping of mitochondrial haplotype H in
a large, prospectively enrolled cohort of VLBW-infants.
Infants with different mitochondrial haplotype were
compared with regard to body temperature at admission,
sepsis prevalence and outcome.
Results: Genotyping was successful in 809 VLBW-
infants. Infants carrying the haplotype H (n=351, 43%)
were not different to non-carriers with regard to
gestational age (29.1 vs. 29.1 weeks), birth weight (1110
vs. 1094 grams) or body temperature at admission (36.5
vs. 36.5 degrees centigrade). Non-carriers of
mitochondrial haplotype H had a higher risk of blood-
culture-proven sepsis (24.2% vs. 17.7%, p=0.025,
- 78 -
Fisher’s exact test). The rate of sepsis with coagulase
negative staphylococci was not different between non-
carriers and carriers of mitochondrial haplotype H
(11.1% vs. 9.4%). Sepsis due to other bacteria was
significantly more common in non-carriers of
mitochondrial haplotype H (14.6% vs. 8% in carriers of
haplotype H, p=0.004, Fisher’s exact-test). This was
also true, if only the prevalence of gram-negative sepsis
was analysed (6.6% vs. 3.1% in carriers of
mitochondrial haplotype H, p=0.035, Fisher’s exact
test). Mortality was not different between non-carriers
and carriers of haplotype H who developed sepsis
(13.4% vs. 7.1%).
Conclusions: VLBW-infants carrying the mitochondrial
haplotype H have a lower risk of developing blood-
culture-positive sepsis during their stay in the hospital.

STREPTOCOCCAL INVASIVE DISEASE - THE
PORTUGUESE PSU RESULTS
M T Neto, A Nunes, M Mateus
Portuguese Paediatric Surveillance Unit, Lisbon,
Portugal
Background and Aims: Group B Streptococcus (GBS)
is the most common cause of invasive disease in the
neonate. Our aim was 1) To assess the epidemiology of
GBS infection <90 days of life; 2) To determine if
prophylaxis of early-onset GBS neonatal infection can
be based only on risk factors.
Methods: National epidemiologic surveillance.
Duration - 4 years - April 1st, 2001 to 31st March, 2005.
Case definition: any infant <90 days with GBS positive
culture in any supposed sterile fluid or place - blood,
CSF or joint aspirate.
Results: 241 cases of GBS invasive disease were
reported (estimated incidence - 0.5/1000LB). Infection
occurred <7 days in 199 newborns (82%) and >7 days in
42 - 28 until 28 days and 14 after. The incidence of
early-onset and late-onset infection was respectively
0.44/1000LB and 0.1/1000LB; 196 were term babies
(81%) 166 of whom became hill < 7 days (69% of all).
There were 227 positive blood cultures, 46 meningitis
and 48 pneumonia. Mothers of 45/166 (27%) term
babies with early-onset infection had intrapartum fever
or membranes rupture >18 hours. Lethality - 6.6%
(16/241) - 6.5% <7d and 7.1%>7d; 15.5% in preterm,
4.6% in term babies, 18% in VLBW.
Conclusions: GBS infection is predominantly an early
infection of the term baby and is rare after the first
month of life; its lethality is higher in preterm and
VLBW infants. GBS prophylaxis based on risk factors
would leave undetected 73% of term babies with early-
onset disease suggesting that, in Portugal, universal
GBS screening should be advised.

Background and Aims: S. epidermidis is the most
frequent cause of nosocomial infections, particularly in
patients with indwelling catheters. Biofilm production
has a central role in pathogenesis. PIA, encoded by the
icaADBC locus, is the main component of biofilms. We
previously demonstrated that ethanol enhances S.
epidermidis biofilm production. Bacteriostatic 0.9%
NaCl, water and heparin sodium solution used in
hospitals, contain 0.9% -1% benzyl alcohol as
preservative. We hypothesized that benzyl alcohol-
containing solutions can enhance biofilm formation in S.
epidermidis.
Methods: We studied 10 S. epidermidis strains obtained
from blood cultures of infants and hands of nurses in
neonatal intensive care unit. All strains had the same
PFGE pattern and contained icaADBC locus. Biofilm
production was quantified using microtiter plate assay in
plain media and media supplemented with bacteriostatic
0.9%NaCl, water or heparin sodium solution containing
benzyl alcohol, as well as with the same solutions
without benzyl alcohol (controls).
Results: Despite having an indistinguishable PFGE
pattern, tested strains differed in ability to form
biofilms. Six strains that were low biofilm producers in
plain media displayed a significant enhancement
(p<0.01) in biofilm production when media was
supplemented with less the 0.7% benzyl alcohol-
containing solutions. One strain was consistently strong
biofilm producer and three strains did not produce
biofilms in tested conditions.
Conclusions: 1. Benzyl alcohol, preservative in
solutions widely used in the hospitals, enhances
production of biofilm by certain S. epidermidis strains.
2. It is a major cause for concern that pathogenic
potential of S. epidermidis is influenced by solutions
administered through indwelling catheters.

Background and Aims: Small for gestational age
(SGA) infants with very low birthweight (VLBW,
<1500g) are at increased mortality risk in comparison to
their appropriate weight for gestational age (AGA)
peers, while effects on their morbidity are less clear. The
aim of this multicenter analysis was to investigate
whether SGA-neonates are at increased risk of
nosocomial infections (NI).
Methods: The German national surveillance system for
NIs in NICUs includes data from VLBW infants
admitted to one of 47 large NICUs. Data from n=6681
infants, born 2000-2004, were available. Growth
retardation was defined as birthweight <10th percentile,
AGA as birthweight between the 10th and 90th
percentile. Outcome variables were nosocomial sepsis,
pneumonia, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).
Univariable data analyses, logistic.
Results: After applying pre-specified inclusion criteria
n=2918 SGA- and AGA-neonates (24-regression, and
general estimating equation models were performed, the
latter to appreciate data clustering within NICUs. 28
weeks) were selected, 13% (n=392) SGA- and 87%
(n=2526) AGA-infants. Thirty three percent had at least
one episode of sepsis, 42% of the SGA- and 31% of the
AGA infants (adjusted Odds Ratio 1.41, 95%
Confidence Interval 1.05-1.89). Pneumonia was
diagnosed in 6%, 8.4% in SGA- and 5.5% in AGA
newborns (adj. OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.05-2.36). A similar
proportion experienced NEC (5%), 7% SGA- and 5% of
AGA-infants (adj. OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.75-1.94).
Conclusions: Growth retarded preterm infants appear to
be at increased risk of nosocomial infections. These
results should prompt more research on possible
immunity deficiencies and their sequelae in preterm
SGA newborns.
HYPERGLYCAEMIC EPISODES (HE) AS AN
EARLY MARKER OF SEPSIS IN PREMATURE
INFANTS LESS THAN 30 WEEKS GESTATION
AND LESS THAN 1000G BIRTHWEIGHT (ELBW)
J R Fernandez Alvarez, T Dygas, P Amess, H Rabe
Trevor Mann Baby Unit, Royal Sussex County Hospital,
Brighton, East Sussex, UK
Background and Aims: Early diagnosis of sepsis in
preterms is difficult. Platelet count and CRP are
specific, but late markers of sepsis. IL-6/IL-8 are
sensitive, but expensive early markers. ELBW newborns
have 18 times more HE than those >2000g. The aim was
to investigate the use of HE in the early diagnosis of
sepsis in ELBW newborns.
Methods: Retrospective analysis of data from ELBW
newborns with 1 HE (>144mg/dl) was performed.
Onset, duration and frequency of HE, glucose intake,
medication and glucose values before, during and after
HE were recorded. Frequency of sepsis (pos. blood
culture, and/or CRP >10mg/l and/or thrombocytopaenia
<150000/microliter) and temporal relation to HE were
recorded. Results are given as median.
Results: 8 preterms (26 weeks and 733g) with a total of
12 HE (1.5/patient) were identified. Blood glucose was
180mg/dl during HE and 90mg/dl 24h before/after HE
(p=0.005 compared to pre-values and p=0.002 compared
to post-values). HE occurred on day 4-5 and lasted for 4
days. Glucose-intake was 9mg/kg/min. Sepsis was
detected 18 times during 53 days of stay (2.3/patient and
1/23 days). Sepsis-workup was performed 3 days after
begin of HE (p=0.025). Sepsis was diagnosed 3 days
later in 11/12 HE (p=0.004). 11/18 septic episodes
presented with HE (p=0.35). Sensitivity and positive
predictive value for HE as early marker of sepsis were
61% and 92%.
Conclusions: ELBW newborns have HE that may be
associated with sepsis. HE seem to indicate sepsis
earlier and more specifically than other markers such as
CRP and thrombocytopaenia.

Background and Aims: A constant infusion rate over
24h results in a better bactericidal efficacy of
vancomycin since it’s action is time-dependent.
Proposed dosage schedules (Palowtsky 1998, Borderon
1994) are complex leadind to low serum vancomycin
concentrations and unconstant bacteriological efficiency
(personal data). We evaluated a new simplified dosage
schedule based on body weight and serum creatinine.
Methods: Prospective data collection during routine use
of vancomycin in premature neonates. In case of
suspected septicemia gram-positive infections blood was
collected for culture and creatinine measurement before
antibiotic administration. Starting vancomycin dosage
was 25 or 15 mg/kg/d during the first period and 30 or
20 mg/kg/d during the second period whether serum
creatinine was below or above 90μmol/L, regardless of
gestational or postconceptional age. Then blood
sampling was performed 48h after the initiation of
treatment (blood culture, serum vancomycin). Required
therapeutic range was 10-25mg/L.
Results: Between June 2002 and April 2005, 118
neonates were evaluated (Period 1:76, Period 2:42). At
T1, 77% (91/118) had serum vancomycin concentrations
within the required range, with an improvement between
period1 and period2. Half (58/118, 49%) had confirmed
infection. The cure rates of sepsis related to
staphylococcus were respectively 75% and 96% 48h and
96h after the beginning of antibiotic treatment.
Conclusions: Using that improved new dosage schedule
most premature neonates had serum vancomycin
concentrations within the required therapeutic range and
the bactericial efficacy was satisfactory.

Background and Aims: Amylin is a novel 37 amino
acid peptide that is co-secreted with insulin from the
pancreas in response to food intake. As a potent
inhibitor of gastric motility it plays an important role in
the control of carbohydrate absorption by regulating the
efflux from the stomach to the small bowel. Feed
intolerance results in prolonged parenteral fluid therapy,
increased hospital stay, increased risk of sepsis and
consequently increased cost of treatment. We
hypothesized that amylin levels may be raised in
newborns with feed intolerance. We aimed to determine
the relationship between amylin levels and gastric
emptying in newborns with feed intolerance.
Methods: Blood from a serial sample of 16 infants
greater than 24 weeks gestation was analysed for amylin
levels. Feed intolerance was defined as gastric residual
volume of greater than 50% of previous 4 hour feed
volume on two consecutive occasions. Eight infants
were classified as feed-intolerant (nTOL) and 8 as feed-
tolerant (TOL).
Results: (Table: mean (SD) and [ranges]). The mean
serum amylin concentration was significantly higher in
feed intolerant group.
Conclusions: Amylin levels are elevated in newborns
with feed intolerance and may play a role in delaying
establishment of enteral nutrition in this population.

Background and Aims: Low birth weight is associated
with increased risk of arterial hypertension and
metabolic diseases in adulthood. Rapid postnatal growth
may constitute an additional risk. AIM: to investigate
the effects of postnatal overfeeding (OF) after IUGR in
aged rats.
Methods: 4 groups of animals were investigated: group
I, controls; group II, offspring of dams fed low protein
diet (LP, caseine 9%);group III, postnatal OF (reduction
of litter size); group IV, LP rats exposed to postnatal
OF. Glomerular number, SBP, intra-peritoneal glucose
test, and renal function (GFR) were evaluated at
different ages up to 22 months.
Results: (meam+/-SEM). LP rats had 20% birth weigt
and 38% glomerular number reduction in comparison
with control (p<0.01). LP+OF rats caught up the weight
of control within the first 15 postnatal days. In
comparison with control, SBP was higher in LP+OF at 4
wks (+17 mmHg, p<0.05) wich remained elevated at 12
months. In comparison with controls, LP+OF had
glucose intolerance at 12 months, 2 fold elevated
proteinuria at 4 months, progressive decline of GFR
with age occuring principally in males, a reduction of
kidney weight (1.84+/-0.1 g vs 2.06 +/-0.1, p<0.05), and
increased glomerular volume (+50%). Histologic
examination showed marked glomerular injury with
tubular hypertrophy.
Conclusions: Early catch-up growth in IUGR enhances
alterations of SBP, GT and renal function in adult rats.
Postnatal overfeeding may amplify single nephron
hyperfiltration resulting over a long time to glomerular
sclerosis and reduction of renal functions. The gender
seems inflence these effects.

Background and Aims: Gastrointestinal intolerance is
a well known problem among very-low-birth-weight
(VLBW) infants. Parenteral nutrition during long
periods is therefore needed, which increase the risk for
both delayed growth and morbity. Previous studies has
shown that feeding given as a slow rate infusion
enhances duodenal motor function and decrease energy
expenditure when compared to bolus feeding. The aim
- 81 -
of the study was to compare the effects of continuous
versus intermittent feeding on gastrointestinal tolerance
and growth in VLBW-infants.
Methods: In a randomized, controlled trial conducted at
three neonatal units, seventy premature infants, with a
gestational age 24-29 weeks and birth weights < 1200
grams, were assigned to one of three feeding methods:
1. Continuous nasogastric feeding, 2. Intermittent
nasogastric feeding or 3. Intermittent orogastric feeding.
Feeding was initiated within 30 hours of birth. Daily
enteral and parenteral volumes, caloric and protein
intakes, growth, enteral intolerance and clinical
complications were collected. Cox regression analysis
was used to determine primary outcome, the time to
achieve full enteral feeding.
Results: The continuous fed infants achieved full
enteral feeding significantly faster than intermittently
fed infants, hazard ratio (HR) 1.86 (95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.07-3.22). In stratified analysis according
to birth weight, the improvement was even more
pronounced in the smallest infants, <850 grams,
adjusted HR = 4.13 (95% CI: 1.48-11.53). Growth rate
was significantly faster among the continuous fed
infants (p 0.002).
Conclusions: In VLBW-infants continuous feeding
seems to be a more beneficial alternative compared to
intermittent feeding with regard to gastrointestinal
tolerance and growth.

Background and Aims: Recently, we demonstrated
that administration of parenteral amino acids (AA)
immediately after birth to premature infants is safe and
results in positive nitrogen balances via increased
protein synthesis. Apart from whole body effects, we
wanted to determine organ specific effects of early AA
administration. Albumin is an organ specific parameter
produced in the liver and often found to be in low
concentrations in premature infants. We hypothesised
that the fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of albumin
increases in premature infants if AA are administered
immediately following birth. The FSR represents the
fraction that is renewed per unit of time.
Methods: Premature infants (<1500 g) received the first
two postnatal days either solely glucose (control group,
n=5) or glucose and AA (intervention group, n=6). On
the second day of life, both groups received a primed
continuous infusion of [1-13C] leucine and blood was
sampled after 5 and 6 hours. Albumin was extracted
from the plasma, hydrolyzed, derivatized, and leucine
isotopomers were subsequently measured with a gas
chromatography - combustion - isotope ratio mass
spectrometer (GC-C-IRMS). Plasma alpha-
ketoisocaproate was measured by GC-MS and used as
an intracellular leucine precursor.
Results: Birth weight and gestational age were not
different between infants in the control (986 ± 284 g;
27.9 ± 2.2 wks) and intervention groups (930 ± 143 g;
27.8 ± 1.8 wks). The control group had a lower FSR
(14.8 ± 6.0%/d) than the infants who also received AA
(23.9 ± 6.2%/d) (p=0.036).
Conclusions: AA administration immediately after birth
to premature neonates increases the FSR of albumin.

Netherlands
Background and Aims: Cyst(e)ine is a non-essential
amino acid in adult humans. It can be synthesized from
methionine by transsulfuration and this is regulated
through the enzyme cystathionase. Cyst(e)ine is
considered as a conditionally essential amino acid in
preterm infants due to low cystathionase activity.
However, the cyst(e)ine requirement in infants is not
defined. Aim is to determine the cyst(e)ine requirement
in preterm infants with a gestational age of 26 to 29
weeks at the age of 35 to 37 weeks by use of indicator
amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique.
Methods: Twenty-five preterm infants (gestational age
28.1 wk ± 1.2 wk SD, BW 1.05 kg ± 0.21 kg SD) who
tolerated full enteral feeding, were randomly assigned to
one of the graded cyst(e)ine test diets (11, 22, 32, 43, 65
mg cyst(e)ine/100 ml formula). After 24 hours of
adaptation, cyst(e)ine requirement was determined by
using [1-13C]phenylalanine hydroxylation. 13CO2
release from [1-13C]phenylalanine was measured by
isotopic ratio mass spectrometry and linear regression
was used to calculate the cyst(e)ine requirement.
Results: Graded dietary cyst(e)ine levels did not show a
significant decrease in fractional [1-13C]phenylalanine
oxidation. Linear regression of the data showed that the
slope was not different from zero (p=0.29), indicating
that cyst(e)ine is not essential.
Conclusions: From these data we can conclude that
cyst(e)ine is not an essential amino acid in VLBW
premature infants receiving full enteral feeding at
postnatal age of two months. These data do not support
the hypothesis that cystathionase activity is limited in
two-month-old premature infants.

Background and Aims: To examine whether
supplementing formula with oligosaccharide mixture
may modulate bilirubin total (BT) levels in formula fed
infants during the first weeks of life by modification of
intestinal microflora.
Methods: 76 full-term infants were double blind
randomly allocated into two groups to receive either
supplementation of oligosacharides (GOS/FOS ratio 9:1,
0.8 g/100ml (n=37) or maltodexrine (n=39), from birth.
BT (TcB) level was determined by multiwavelength
spectral analysis, (BiliCheck) within 2 hours after birth
(T0), 24hs (T2), 72 hs (T4) and at completed 28 (T8)
days of life. Capillary hematocrit (Ht) was further
determined.
Results: Groups were comparable for birth weight,
gestational age, maternal age, type of delivery, baseline
(T0) serum TcB level, and HT level. Pattern of TcB
significantly differed between groups through the study
(p<0.01; Anova for repeated measures). Infants in
supplemented group exhibited lower plasma TcB levels
than placebo group from 72 h of life onwards : T4
difference was -2.41mg/dl, p<0.010. At T8, mean TcB
level was 2.4 mg/dl (gos-fos) vs. 3.0mg/dl (placebo). Ht
significantly decreased from birth to day 28 in both
groups (P<0.0001) but no difference between groups
was found (P>0.55).
Conclusions: We observed significantly lowers
bilirubin level after 72 hours of life in formula fed
infants, supplementation of a mixture of gos-fos. It may
be hypothesize that stimulating the intestinal growth of
bifidobacteria and lactobacilli they enhances bilirubin
excretion by reducing it to urobilinoids. Larger
randomized trials would be of interest to evaluate
prophylactic and therapeutic use of gos-fos in neonatal
hyperbilirubinemia.

Background and Aims: As there are still no proposed
guidelines about post-discharge nutrition, we evaluated
growth and whole-body mineralization in VLBW
infants fed preterm (PF) or term (TF) formula.
Methods: Double-blind randomized study in preterm
infants randomized at discharge (T0) to be fed PF or TF.
Subjects were fed PF or TF until one month after
theoretical term (T1). Then, all subjects received TF
until 3 months after theoretical term (T2).
Anthropometric data and whole-body Dual-energy X-
ray Absorptiometry were assessed at T0, T1 and T2.
Statistical differences between the 2 feeding groups
assessed using t-test or Mann-Whitney.
Results: Clinical characteristics were similar between
the 2 feeding groups at birth and at T0 (PF, n=23:
PNA=44 15, BW=1989 115g - TF, n=24: PNA=45 15
d, BW=2016 94g). Body weight at T1 (PF=4533 984g
vs TF=4144 675g, p=0.12) and T2, bone mineral
content (BMC) at T1 (PF=71 23g vs TF=60 16g,
p=0.07) tended to be higher in PF group than in TF
group. At T2, BMC was significantly higher in PF group
than in TF group (104 29g vs 88 17g, p=0.03).
Difference in BMC was related to an increase in bone
mineral density and persisted when BMC was expressed
as g per kg BW.
Conclusions: Four months after discharge, we observed
a better growth and whole-body mineralization in
VLBW infants fed PF than in those fed TF during the
first two months after discharge. It could be of particular
interest at this early stage of development. Study funded

Background and Aims: Breast milk fed preterm
neonates need to be fortified to achieve adequate weight
gain. The composition of the available fortifiers differs
and has a potential influence on acid load. Since the
introduction of a new commercially available human
milk fortifier in our neonatal unit we observed an
increased incidence of metabolic acidosis. Therefore, we
compared the effect of two different fortifiers on the
development of metabolic acidosis and weight gain.
Methods: Preterm infants on >100ml/kg oral feeds with
mothers milk only were randomised and supplemented
with fortifiers. Clinical and laboratory parameters were
collected using a standardised protocol. In case of
acidosis (BE<-6mmol/L) the other fortifier was fed after
recovery of the metabolic status.
Results: 34 infants were studied, fortifier 1 (n=15, 30.0
weeks ± 3.4, birthweight: 1282g ± 488), fortifier 2
(n=19, 29.3 weeks ± 3.4, birthweight: 1247g ± 464).
Acidosis (BE: -6.1 to -9.3 mmol/L) developed 3 infants
with fortifier 1, 6 with fortifier 2 (p= .36). Most of these
had a birthweight <1000g. Acidotic infants <1000g
seem to develop a stronger temporary decrease in daily
weight gain with longer time of supplementation.
Discontinuation of the fortifier resulted in normalization
of the acid base status. After cross-over (n=6) all infants
developed metabolic acidosis within 4 days.
- 83 -
Conclusions: The present study shows that breast milk
fortifier can have clinical impact on the acid base status
and weight gain of preterm neonates.
IS INTRAPARTUM ASPHYXIA PREVENTABLE?
AT WHAT COST?
J C Becher, B J Stenson, A J Lyon
Department of Neonatology, Royal Infirmary of
Edinburgh, Scotland
Background and Aims: Recent evidence suggests that
asphyxia-related perinatal mortality and morbidity
(ARMM) are declining. We wished to examine local
delivery unit trends in ARMM and operative deliveries
between 1994-2005.
Methods: Records of all full-term inborn admissions
were retrospectively reviewed for the diagnosis of
‘hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy’ (HIE) and related
diagnoses. Accuracy of diagnosis was verified. Three-
year moving averages of HIE, full-term intrapartum
stillbirths, delivery room asphyxial neonatal deaths, and
full-term operative deliveries were calculated and trends
analysed with the Chi-square test.
Results: There were 116 infants with HIE, 7
intrapartum stillbirths and 2 delivery room deaths.
ARMM fell progressively from 2.86/1000 births to
0.91/1000 births (p<0.001). The incidence of HIE
declined steadily from 2.41 to 0.77/1000 livebirths
(p<0.001). Operative deliveries increased from 28.1-
42.7% (p<0.001).
Conclusions: ARMM declined significantly over 12
years associated with a large increase in operative
deliveries. Expeditious delivery may have prevented a
small number of ARMM, but the associated morbidity
of an escalating operative delivery rate needs evaluation.

Background and Aims: Valid estimation of preterm
infants’ survival to discharge requires studies of
geographically defined populations.
Methods: As part of a larger research project on Very
Preterm Pregnancies and Births (ACTION), an area-
based study was carried out including all births and late
terminations of pregnancies occurred in 2003-2004 in
four Italian regions: Friuli Venezia Giulia, Toscana,
Lazio and Marche. Data on maternal characteristics,
pregnancy and, for liveborn, admission to Neonatal
Intensive Care Units (NICUs) were collected.
Results: 2410 events were recorded: 1745 livebirths
(82%), 378 stillbirths (18%) and 287 late terminations
(12%). Children of foreign women contributed to 22%
of total births, and multiples to about 25%. The
proportion of livebirths ranged from 18% at 22 to 94%
at 31 weeks gestation. 1710 infants (98% of liveborn)
were admitted to NICU. Survival to discharge was 82%
among NICUs admissions (from 6% at 22 to 96% at 31
weeks), 81% among livebirths, and only 66% when all
births were considered.
Conclusions: Estimates of survival of preterm infants
change according to the selected denominator. These
findings have implications for parents' counselling
during pregnancy.

Background and Aims: Dopplersonography has shown
a sharp increase in diastolic blood flow velocity in
cerebral arteries following PDA closure. Using near-
infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) we aimed to assess acute
effects of surgical closure on cerebral oxygenation and
cerebral blood volume (CBV).
Methods: Ten preterm infants, birth weight 590 – 1070
g (median 748 g), gestational age 23 - 27 wks (median
24 wks) were studied during surgery (day 12 - 22 of life;
median 14). Using NIRS, changes in concentrations of
cerebral oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin
were measured, and changes in CBV and cerebral
oxygenation were calculated. Heart rate, arterial oxygen
saturation (pulse oxymetry), tcPO2, tcPCO2, and blood
pressure were registered simultaneously.
Results: During the first two minutes after closure CBV
increased significantly (+0.14 mg/100 mg tissue; SE
0.97; p=0.004) and returned to baseline at 2 to 5
minutes. Cerebral oxygenation did not change
significantly (-0.05 μmol/l; SE 0.97; p=0.9) but arterial
oxygen saturation decreased (2.8%; SE 0.4; p<0.0001).
At 5 to 10 minutes after closure tcPCO2 decreased (-3.4
mbar; SE 1.2; p=0.02) and heart rate increased (+2.0
- 84 -
bpm; SE 0.7; p=0.02). Blood pressure did not change
significantly.
Conclusions: NIRS was an appropriate tool to assess
changes in CBV and cerebral oxygenation. Surgical
closure of PDA induced an acute increase of CBV.

Mantua, Italy
Background and Aims: Benefits and safety of mild-
moderate hypothermia (34-35,5 C and 33-34,5 C
respectively) to treat perinatal asphyxia are documented.
In animal studies, neuroprotective effect seems to be
proportional to the depth of hypothermia but with more
side effects. The aim of this study is to determine the
safety of hypothermia to 30-33 C in term asphyxiated
infants. Mortality, major neurologic abnormalities and
major RMI cerebral lesions are described, comparing
these results with historical controls.
Methods: Term infants admitted for perinatal asphyxia
were enrolled within 6 hours after birth and treated with
hypothermia (rectal temperatures around 30-33 C) for
72 hours. Neurological abnormalities and RMI cerebral
lesions were evaluated.
Results: Fourteen patients were treated with whole body
cooling to 30-33 C. The mean gestational age was 39.4
(2.1) weeks, pre-treatment arterial pH 6.9 (0.1), BE-17.2
(5) and lactate 14.3 (5.6) mmol/L. Hypothermia was
started at 3.1 (1.6) hours of age and mean rectal
temperature was 32.1 C (0.9). Three subjects presented
pneumonia on their 2nd-3rd day of life, recovered after
antibiotic therapy. Brain RMI documented major
cerebral lesions only in one case who also presented a
severe psychomotor delay. Comparing these data with
clinical outcome and neuroimaging lesions of an
untreated group with similar characteristics at birth, we
obtained statistically significant better results (p<0,05).
We did not observe any difference between the groups
treated with different depths (mild-moderate deep) of
hypothermia.
Conclusions: By our preliminary data, it appears that
hypothermic treatment between 30-33 C is safe and
neuroprotective. Further studies are mandatory to
confirm these data.

Background and Aims: An objective definition of
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is required to
interpret trial outcomes and provide a baseline for
prognostic studies. Reduced ventilation/perfusion ratio
(VA/Q) and increased right to left shunt can be
determined non-invasively by plotting oxygen saturation
(SpO2) against inspired oxygen pressure (PIO2).
Reduced VA/Q causes a right shift of the SpO2 against
PIO2 curve. We describe the reduced VA/Q and shunt
in infants with BPD.
Methods: 21 preterm infants with BPD were studied at
36 weeks CGA. PIO2 was varied in steps to cause SpO2
to vary between 86-94%. Pairs of SpO2 and PIO2
values were plotted and analysed to derive reduced
VA/Q and shunt.
Results: In every infant the SpO2 vs PIO2 curve was
shifted to the right of normal due to reduced VA/Q.
Mean right shift was 16.5 kPa (normal 6kPa). Three
infants plots enclosed. Shunt was small in all cases
mean 8.9%. The degree of right shift was strongly
predictive of the PIO2 required to achieve any SpO2
within the range 86-94%, (R2>0.9), permitting shift and
VA/Q to be determined from a single pair of SpO2 and
PIO2 values in this range.
Conclusions: Reduced VA/Q ratio is the dominant gas
exchange defect in BPD. This can be described by the
right shift of the SpO2 vs PIO2 relationship. A single
pair of SpO2 and PIO2 values predicts VA/Q ratio and
provides graded physiologically objective measure of
BPD disease severity.

Background and Aims: Controversy continues
regarding initiation of life supporting measures in
infants born before 25 weeks gestation, with wide
variations between units and between different
countries. In Western Australia (WA) a long standing
permissive approach to the support of these infants and
centralisation of perinatal services has allowed us to
examine resource use and long term outcome in a
regional study of this small group in relation to the
wider picture of perinatal care. Aims: 1. To demonstrate
trends in survival <25 weeks since 1992. 2. To examine
resource use in WA, (hospital days, respiratory support
days, estimated dollar costs) 3. To assess frequency and
severity of disability from 1992-2002.
- 85 -
Methods: Overlapping cohorts were analysed for
Survival (1992-2004, n=378), Resource use (2002-2004,
n=69 of all 5,713 neonatal admissions), and Outcome
(1992-2002, n=151). Severe disability was defined as
nonambulant cerebral palsy (CP), or DQ/IQ > 3sd below
mean, or blind.
Results: Admissions <25w represented 0.1% of all
regional births, <1.5% of NICU admissions, 8% of
<33w admissions. Survivors at 22w (8), 23w (48) and
24w (95) represented 5% of all <33w survivors. NICU
survival rates increased from 38% to 71%. <25w infants
accounted for 8% of patient stay days, 27% of
respiratory support days, and 11% of estimated NICU
costs. Severe disability occurred in 10% of survivors.
There were no blind or nonambulant CP cases.
Conclusions: In this regional study, births <25w are
infrequent, but do account for a disproportionate amount
of nursery resources. Ninety percent of the survivors are
not severely disabled.

Background and Aims: The quality of mother-infant
interaction is important for very premature (VP) infants
who are at risk for cognitive delay. This study aims to
investigate the impact of a very premature twin birth on
parenting stress, maternal responsiveness and quality of
mother-infant interaction.
Methods: Mothers of 17 VP twins (<32 weeks
gestation), drawn from a parenting intervention study,
formed the study sample. The target twin was chosen at
random. Each mother was matched for age, educational
attainment and parity with a singleton mother. At 3
months corrected age mothers were videotaped whilst
attempting to teach their infant a developmentally
appropriate task. Videos were rated using The Nursing
Child Assessment Teaching Scale (NCATS) to assess
the quality of both caregiver and infant interactions. The
responsivity subscale of the HOME was also
administered and mothers completed the short-form
Parenting Stress Index.
Results: During one to one interaction, maternal
NCATS scores were similar between groups but twin
infants had lower NCATS scores than singletons,
indicating less clear and responsive interactions
(p<0.04). This effect remained even after controlling for
infant factors. Twin mothers had lower HOME scores
(p<0.03) and 24% of twin mothers had clinically high
levels of parenting stress compared to none in the
singleton group (p=0.05).
Conclusions: Mothers of twins reported high levels of
stress and twins received less responsive day to day
care. This may explain the poorer quality of
communication shown by twins during one to one
interactions and suggests that twin status may be an
additional vulnerability factor for very premature
infants.

Background and Aims: We previously demonstrated
that treatment with the Topiramate immediately after
unilateral cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in neonatal
rats extended the therapeutic window of post-HI
hypothermic neuroprotection, in terms of both function
and neuropathology. To begin to address whether this
effect of Topiramate is generalizable to other
anticonvulsants, we tested phenobarbital (PB) in a
similar paradigm.
Methods: P7 rats underwent right carotid ligation
followed by 90 min in 8% O2. Fifteen min after HI, rats
received PB 40 mg/kg (n=12) or saline vehicle (n=11).
Beginning 3 hr after HI all rats underwent 3 hr
hypothermia (HT) in a 27 C incubator. One wk later
lateral vibrissae stimulated forepaw placing was
evaluated in 10 trials/side, followed by quantitation of
ipsilateral damage severity [%left-right difference =
100*(L-R)/L] in cortex, striatum and hippocampus.
Results: On P14, the contralateral vibrissae-stimulated
placing deficit typical of HI was attenuated in the
PB+delayed HT (PB+dHT) group compared to the
delayed HT (dHT) group [median (IQR) PB+dHT: 9
(2.5) vs. dHT 5 (5.5), P<0.05 Mann-Whitney]. In
contrast damage severity was not attenuated in the
PB+dHT group, compared to dHT alone (%damage
mean ±SD, PB+dHT vs. dHT: cortex, 41.5±30.5 vs.
49.5±30.4, striatum 44.5±30.4 vs. 56.2±29.7,
hippocampus 52.4±30 vs. 62.1±28.1, p=NS).
Conclusions: An anticonvulsant dose of PB did not
restore the protective effect of delayed hypothermia on
post-HI neuropathology, although there was a
dissociated beneficial effect on a sensorimotor function
measure. Thus the efficacy of Topiramate in extending
the therapeutic window of HT does not represent a
generalized effect of anticonvulsant therapy in neonatal
rodent HI.
NEW TRENDS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF
NEONATAL BRAIN INJURY
M Thoresen
Department of Clinical Sciences, St. Michael's Hospital,
Bristol, UK
Perinatal asphyxial encephalopathy remains an
important complication in newborn infants occurring in
1-2/1000 births in Europe and is associated with a high
risk of death or major neurological and
- 86 -
neurodevelopmental abnormalities in survivors.
Experimental and clinical studies show that following
asphyxia, multiple inter-related pathophysiological
processes that culminate in necrotic and apoptotic cell
death occur over a prolonged period. Experimentally,
hypothermia ameliorates these processes and reduces
the severity of cerebral injury. Recently completed trials
of treatment with moderate induced hypothermia
following perinatal asphyxial encephalopathy confirm
that clinically significant improvement in outcome is
possible. When hypothermia will be used as standard
treatment for all infants with severe asphyxia we are
faced with several questions. Which early entry criteria
do we use? How do we cool? Is head cooling or total
body cooling best? Should this intervention only be
applied in level III units or is there also a place for
treatment in local hospitals? Temperature management
after brain injury is important, in particular avoiding
rebound hyperthermia which easily occurs when
circulation is restored. Number needed to treat was 6 in
the 2 large clinical trials published in 20051,2 meaning
that 5 out of 6 children treated did not have an effect of
hypothermic treatment. Are there more options? Adding
additional drugs to hypothermia? There are recent
experimental studies suggesting a variety of drugs that
might add to the neuroprotection and these will be
reviewed. References: 1. Gluckman PD, Wyatt JS,

Background and Aims: In the developing human brain,
periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is the predominant
white matter injury underlying the development of
cerebral palsy. Our group recently showed that short
exposure to high oxygen levels can trigger apoptosis in
immature, but not in mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) in
vitro. 17 -estradiol (E2) plays an important role in the
development and function of the CNS. The sudden drop
in circulating estrogen after birth may aggravate the
susceptibility to oxidative stress in premature infants.
We examined the effect of E2, and phytoestrogens on
hyperoxia-induced cell death in immature rat OLs.
Methods: Primary OL cultures were subjected to
80%O2 in the presence or absence of estrogen (10-6-10-
10M). LDH assay was used to assess cell viability. OL
maturation status and caspase-3 activation were studied
by immunochemistry. Immunoblot analysis was used to
quantify ER expression, and demonstrated an
upregulation of ER- after E2-pretreatment.
Results: E2, stigmasterol, and -sitosterol, but not
campesterol or genistein, produced significant dose-
dependent protection against oxygen-induced apoptotic
cell death in OLs. In addition, we studied the impact of
E2 on the expression of the pro-apoptotic receptor Fas.
Treatment with E2 prevented hyperoxia-induced Fas-
upregulation. Finally, we found by immunoblot analysis
that E2 antagonizes hyperoxia-induced inactivation of
ERK1/2 and AKT, key kinases of the MAPK and PI3-
kinase cell survival promoting pathways, respectively.
Conclusions: These results may be relevant to concerns
regarding oxidative injury to the premature infant brain,
both at normal and at high oxygen levels, and suggest a
possible role for estrogens in the prevention of PVL.

Kinderspital Beider Basel, Switzerland
Background and Aims: Advances in neonatal medicine
have improved survival of premature and term infants.
Unfortunately survivors of premature birth often suffer
from neurologic morbidity. Clinical studies have
identified hyperoxia as a risk factor for cerebral palsy.
Experimental studies show that short exposure to high
oxygen levels can trigger neurodegeneration in the
developing rat brain. This neuronal death is associated
with reduced expression of neurotrophins and decreased
concentrations of survival-promoting proteins. To
explore further pathogenetic mechanisms, we
investigated the impact of supraphysiological oxygen
levels on members of the proapoptotic Fas (CD95/APO-
1) signalling pathway: Fas-Ligand, caspase-8, caspase-
9, caspase-3, FADD and FLIP.
Methods: Six day old rats were exposed with their
mothers to 80% O2 and were sacrificed at defined time
points (2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 hrs). Brains were either
examined histologically to visualize degenerating cells
or were processed for molecular studies.
Results: Oxygen exposure triggered cell death in the
thalamus and cortex peaking at 12 to 24 hrs. Increased
levels for Fas and Fas-Ligand mRNA were found at 12
and 24h. Immunoblot assays of thalamus tissue for
caspase-8 were upregulated at 48 hrs, for caspase-9 and
FADD at 48 and 72 hrs, for Caspase-3 at 24 and 48 hrs
and for FLIP long and short at 24 to 48 hrs.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that upregulation
of the pro-apoptotic Fas system and his signalling
pathway may contribute to oxygen-induced cell death in
the developing brain.

Background and Aims: Fetal inflammatory response
appears an important cause of damage in the immature
brain. The hippocampal slice culture enables study of
the interaction between induced inflammation and
ischemia and of subsequent neuronal damage in the
immature brain. Methods: Hippocampal slices from
BALB/C mice obtained at P5, placed on Millicell
culture inserts and grown in vitro for 8 days.
Hippocampal slices co-incubated with/without LPS, 1
microg/ml for 24 h and thereafter subjected to oxygen-
glucose deprivation for 15 min. Cytokine levels (IL-6,
IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-12p40 and MCP-1)
and nitric oxide production determined at repeated time
points. Cell death was determined with propidium
iodide (PI) measured by fluorescent light michroscopy
and digital image analysis. Results: Hippocampal slices
pre-exposed to LPS before in vitro ischemia exhibited
increased PI determined cell death in regions CA1-3 and
dentate gyrus from 4 and up to 72 h after in vitro
ischemia (p<0.01). Immunostaining confirmed increased
neuronal depletion and microglial activation in LPS pre-
exposed slices. LPS exposure without subsequent in
vitro ischemia was not associated with neuronal cell
death. Hippocampal slices secreted increased levels of
TNF-alpha, IL-6 and MCP-1 at 12 and 24 h during LPS
exposure (p<0.01) whereas only MCP-1 (p<0.01) was
increased after in vitro ischemia in LPS pre-exposed
slices. Conclusions: Exposure to LPS prior to in vitro
ischemia increases and extends neuronal death in a
juvenile murine hippocampal slice culture. This is
associated with increased microglial activation and with
increased secretion of MCP-1. Sole exposure to LPS
was not associated with neuronal cell death.

Klinikum, Berlin, Germany
Background and Aims: In premature infants oxygen
free radicals are associated with subsequent diseases like
retinopathia of prematurity and bronchopulmonal
dysplasia. Recent studies in brain tissue samples have
shown that nonphysiologic oxygen levels play a key role
in induction of apoptosis in the developing brain. As
female preterm infants consistently revealed a better
neurological outcome then males, estrogen is considered
to be neuroprotective in the premature brain. Astrocytes
appear to have a critical role in protection and survival
of neurons in the brain. As one of the glial cell types
they have a great potential for possible involvement in
the mediation of estrogen neuroprotective effects. Cell
cultures of astrocytes have not yet been investigated
concerning their behaviour in hyperoxic environment.
The aim of our study was to analyze whether astrocytes
in cell cultures are damaged by hyperoxia and whether
estrogen can protect them against apoptosis.
Methods: Cell cultures of astrocytes (rat brain glial
cells, C6) were cultivated in 80% compared to 21%
oxygen environment and in different concentrations of
17beta-estradiol. Apoptosis was verified with caspase 3
staining by flow cytometric analysis.
Results: The presence of estrogen receptors alpha and
beta in astrocytes was confirmed by RT-PCR.
Astrocytes underwent sixfold more apoptosis when
cultivated in hyperoxia compared to normoxia. Addition
of estrogen reduced apoptosis in hyperoxia by 20%.
Conclusions: Hyperoxia induces apoptosis in astrocytes
and estrogen seems to be a protecting factor for
astrocytes in hyperoxia.

Background and Aims: Neurogenesis is completed
after birth, whereas gliogenic activities remain intense
during the postnatal period in the rat cortex. Little is
known about the effects of HI on these critical postnatal
processes. The aim is to study the glial proliferation
after HI injury in the P3 rat parietal cortex (PCx).
Methods: P3 rats had right carotid ligation and 30'
exposure to 6%O2. Glial markers were used: GFAP,
NG2, RIP. Brdu was injected 24h after HI and brains
collected 48h, 72h and 7d after HI. Another group had
Brdu injection 7d after HI and brain collected at 8d.
Within the PCx proliferation was measured by counting
double-labelled cells. The ipsilateral PCx was compared
to the contralateral using the Wilcoxon test. Results: In
the ipsilateral PCx: GFAP and RIP were increased at all
time-points; NG2 was increased at 48h and 72h. In all
groups GFAP/Brdu astrocytes were increased.
NG2/Brdu cells in the 24-48h and 24-72h groups and
RIP/Brdu cells in the 24h-7d group were also increased
in the HI PCx. In the 7d-8d group a significant increase
of GFAP/Brdu, NG2/Brdu and RIP/Brdu was present.
Conclusions: These data show significant modifications
in the glial architecture of the PCx after mild HI injury
that could contribute to long-term alterations in cerebral
development after neonatal injury.

Background and Aims: Studies show hyperoxia results
in apoptosis in immature murine brains, however, little
is known about hyperoxia’s effect on neural
progenitor/stem cells in developing brains. Our study
attempts to determine effects of exposure to 96%
oxygen versus room air on neural progenitor/stem cells
in newborn mice.
Methods: Pups expressing green fluorescent protein
(GFP) under nestin gene control were randomized into 2
groups (n=5/group). P5 animals were subjected to
normoxia (FiO2-0.21), or hyperoxia (FiO2-0.96), for 90
minutes then injected with BrDu x3 over 24 hours and
euthanized. Apoptotic-like changes were determined by
TUNEL staining. Immunohistochemistry was used to
assess lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage
with 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and 8-hydroxy-2-
deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) monoclonal antibodies.
Proliferation was assessed using anti-BrdU antibody.
Nestin+ cells were identified by immunofluorescent
microscopy. Cells were counted in 20 fields in cortical
and ventricular/subventricular zones (VZ). Values are
expressed in mean SD, and normalized with methyl-
green staining.
Results: Neural cells showed weak HNE
immunoreactivity in cortex and VZ controls. Hyperoxic
pups showed increased HNE immunoreactivity and
number in cortex (568±164 vs. 55±24; p=0.0001) and
VZ (311±103 vs. 784±9; p=0.01). 8OHdG+ cells were
increased in hyperoxia cortex (96±47 vs. 10±6,
p=0.032). Cortical TUNEL+ cells were increased in
hyperoxia vs. normoxia (8901±1821 vs. 1930±717,
p=0.0001). GFP+/BrdU+ cortical cells increased in
hyperoxia vs. controls (11120±4536 vs. 1987±1242,
p=0.028).
Conclusions: Data suggests exposure to high oxygen
concentrations increase oxidative stress markers and
apoptotic-like cell death in developing murine brains.
We continue to investigate the increased proliferation of
neural progenitor/stem cells in cortex of hyperoxic pups.

Background and Aims: Hypothermia has been shown
to improve the outcome of perinatal hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy (HIE) within the laboratory and clinical
setting. Currently the physiologic mechanisms of how
hypothermia leads to neuroprotection are not fully
understood. Our objective was to evaluate the role of
hypothermia on EPO receptor expression and to
determine if hypothermia plus EPO has an effect on
cellular signaling.
Methods: Isolated cultures of E18 rat cortical neurons
were obtained from Genlantis. Cells were fully
differentiate for 5 days and then exposed to either
hypothermia or allowed to remain at 37 C. Anti-rabbit
EPO receptor antibody was used in conjunction with
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-
rabbit IgG for immunostaining. Calcium signaling was
studied with the indicator dye Fluo-4 AM.
Results: Using fluorescent microscopy and
immunohistochemistry, we identified a more than 3 fold
increase in EPO receptor expression in E18 cortical
neurons after prior exposure to hypothermia. EPO
dependent intracellular calcium signaling was increased
by more than 2 fold by prior exposure to hypothermia.
Western blot analysis demonstrated a similar increase in
EPO receptor expression caused by hypothermia alone
as was demonstrated with a 1 hour period of hypoxia.
Conclusions: In isolated cortical neurons exposure to
hypothermia alone can increase EPO receptor
expression, and hypothermia plus EPO combined to
significantly increase calcium signaling. Our results
suggest that hypothermia-induced EPO receptor
upregulation could be a mechanism for the
neuroprotective effect of hypothermia previously
described. We are currently examining the combined
effects of hypoxia followed by hypothermia on EPO
receptor expression and cellular signaling.

Background and Aims: Inflammation is regarded a
main cause of cerebral damage, and is believed to be
exacerbated by hypoxia. Nicotine has been shown to
have anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties in
experimental studies. We wish to assess the effect of
nicotine on newborn piglet’s ability to tolerate hypoxia.
Methods: Four groups of newborn piglets (12-36 hours)
were studied: In two groups animals were randomized to
receive either saline or nicotine prior to hypoxia, in two
other groups they received nicotine or saline without
hypoxia. Global hypoxia was induced by ventilation
with 8% oxygen in N2 until Base Excess (BE) < - 20
mmol/L or mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) = 15
mmHg. Microdialysis probes were stereotactically
inserted into the striatum before the experiment started,
- 89 -
to measure glycerol, a marker of hypoxic injury.
Results: Mean time of hypoxia was 66.5 min. (SD 19.7)
in the saline group, and 103.8 min. (SD 28.2) in the
nicotine treated group (p=0.036). BE and pH were lower
in the nicotine pretreated group (p=0.11 and 0.05) at
time of resuscitation, MABP was not significantly
different. There were no significant differences at the
end of the experiment. Microdialysis showed no
differences between the two groups regarding glycerol
in striatum.
Conclusions: The difference in time till ended hypoxia
could, partly, be explained by the fact that nicotine
activates the sympathetic nervous system. There are no
indicators of negative effects of nicotine in this study;
on the contrary the nicotine treated piglets did not show
higher values of glycerol despite longer time till ended
hypoxia.
THE A-B-C OF STREPTOCOCCAL INFECTIONS
IN THE PICU

Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical
Center Utrecht, The Netherlands
The group A streptococcus (GAS), also known as
Streptococcus pyogenes, causes a wide range of
infections and complications. It is the most frequent
cause of bacterial pharyngitis. But it can also cause a
variety of cutaneous and invasive infections, such as
pyoderma, erysipelas, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis,
Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) and myositis, and other
complications such as rheumatic fever and acute
glomerulonephritis. Although the global burden of GAS
infections it not known it has been described that at least
517.000 people die each year due to severe GAS
infections, eg acute rheumatic fever and invasive
infections. Therefore, GAS figures among the 10 major
human pathogens worldwide, only clearly exceeded by
HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and Streptococcus
pneumoniae. GAS is a well known cause of severe
infections and sepsis/shock in the pediatric intensive
care unit (PICU) with a reported mortality rate of
15-25%. The wide range of diseases by GAS with
varying severity has been postulated to be due to
phenotypic variation in GAS. Differences in virulence
factor productions, in ability to invade human epithelial
cells and in secretion of high concentrations of
exotoxins (A-B-C) are described. However, very
recently the difference between a simple GAS
pharyngeal disease and a more disseminated, severe
disease, eg. Toxic Shock Syndrome or necrotizing
fasciitis, is traced to mutations in two regulatory genes.
A single mutation in a global two-component signalling
locus, the so-called Control of virulence R/S (CovRS)
system, alters expression of 10-15% of the genes. The
mutation in CovRS shifts the expression from a
pharyngeal transcriptome (PTP) to an invasive
transcriptome (ITP), which can result in more invasive
disease in human and mice. By ongoing knowledge at
the molecular and gene-expression level, it becomes
more and more clear how bacteria interact with their
hosts to cause a range of diseases that are associated
with infection. As translational medicine, from
laboratory to bedside (PICU), develops further it will be
possible to treat patients in the future more directly at
the molecular-level of their disease. Also the
development of a vaccine against GAS is a possibility to
reduce the colonisation of tonsils and eliminate the
dreadful forms of streptococcal infections. In the mean
time the treatment of invasive GAS infections includes
management of the complications of sepsis, aggressive
surgical debridement if a site of infection is identified
and antibiotics for the underlying infection. GAS
remains susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. However,
clinical failures of penicillin therapy for streptococcal
infections do occur. Therefore, Clindamycin is
recommended in invasive GAS infections together with
penicillin or a carbapenem. Infections with GAS are still
an important cause of morbidity and mortality,
especially in less developed countries, and its global
importance has been under-estimated. By new
developments in molecular and translational medicine in
the near future it will be possible to improve outcome in
GAS infections substantially.

Background and Aims: Infants with a progressive
posthaemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD) have
been treated in our neonatal intensive care unit with a
ventricular reservoir since 1992. The incidence of
infection using this invasive procedure was studied
retrospectively.
Methods: Between January 1992 and December 2003,
76 preterm infants were treated with a ventricular
reservoir. Infants admitted during two subsequent
periods were analysed, group 1:1992-1997 (n=26) and
group 2:1998-2003 (n=50). Clinical characteristics and
number of reservoir punctures were evaluated.
Furthermore the incidence of complications over time
was assessed, with a focus on the occurrence of
infection of the reservoir.
Results: The number of punctures did not change
during both periods. Infection was significantly less
common during the second period, 2/50 (4%), compared
to the first period, 5/26 (19,2%), p=.029.
Conclusions: The use of a ventricular reservoir is a safe
therapy to ensure adequate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
removal in preterm infants with PHVD. In experienced
hands the incidence of infection of the ventricular
reservoir or major complications remains within
acceptable limits.

Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Physicians and nurses on a
Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) are being
confronted with a diversity of patients wounds. Wounds
were being observed subjectively by physicians and
nurses. A wound care assessment tool was not used. Our
PICU is organized with a Patient Data Management
System (PDMS). This PDMS system provides the PICU
staff the possibility to develop a digital photo
registration of the wound that can be downloaded to the
PDMS system. The aim of this project is to use the
developed digital photo system in the PDMS to guide
the process of wound care and eventually improve
wound rehabilitation in the critically ill child.
Methods: Photos are made by using a digital camera.
After taken the photo of the wound, the photo is
downloaded into the Picture Archiving and
Communication System (PACS). Photos are linked to
the PDMS, to the family name and patient identification
number. Photos can be shown on the bedside computer.
Results: With the help of a simple digital registration of
a wound in our PDMS, everybody can see and compare
the development and the healing process of the wounds
of the patient. During the daily medical and nursing
rounds the photos are reviewed and if necessary the
wound care therapy is changed. This results in an
objective wound judgment, assessment and wound care,
which prevents mistakes.
Conclusions: Digital photo registration in combination
with a PDMS does not only lead to an objective wound
care assessment, but also to an unambiguous way of
wound care.

THE 'NEW' APPROACH TO THE
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF
BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA
S H Abman, J P Kinsella
Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado
School of Medicine, The Children's Hospital, Denver,
CO, USA
Background and Aims: Despite surfactant therapy and
improvements in perinatal care, premature infants
remain at high risk for the development of
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Strong preclinical
data demonstrated that impaired production of nitric
oxide (NO) contributes to the pathogenesis of abnormal
alveolar and vascular growth in experimental models of
BPD, and that prolonged treatment with inhaled NO
(iNO) improves lung structure and function in neonatal
animals. However, whether iNO therapy could improve
long-term outcomes of premature newborns remains
uncertain. We hypothesized that prolonged treatment
with low doses of iNO would reduce the incidence of
BPD without worsening brain injury. We further
hypothesized that the effects of iNO therapy may be
partly dependent upon the degree of prematurity.
Methods: We conducted an IRB-approved, multicenter
randomized trial at 16 centers to determine the effects of
iNO in preterm newborns (gestational age < 34 weeks;
BW, 500 – 1250 gms) who required intubation and
mechanical ventilation during the first 48 hours of life.
Newborns were stratified by BW strata (500-749 g,
750 – 999 g, or 1000 – 1250 g) prior to randomization to
iNO (5 ppm) or placebo gas. Assignment remained
masked to care providers and families. BPD was defined
by an oxygen requirement and abnormal chest x-ray at
36 weeks corrected age. Cranial ultrasounds were
obtained prior to enrollment (for baseline incidence of
intraventricular hemorrhage), at 7-14 days, and at more
than 30 days of age. Power analysis determined that 792
infants were needed to detect a reduction in the
incidence of death and BPD from 60% to 50%, given a
statistical power of 80% and a 2-sided alpha of 0.05.
Results: Of the 4562 infants screened, 1921 met
enrollment criteria, and 793 infants were enrolled: 398
to receive inhaled NO and 395 for placebo. The most
common reason for ineligibility was nCPAP or expected
early extubation. Mean BW (786 g), gestational age
(25.6 weeks), male gender (53%), and use of antenatal
steroids (79%) in the iNO group were not different from
controls. Age at randomization (30 hours), oxygenation
index (5.4), surfactant use (78%), use of high-frequency
ventilation (29%) and related baseline characteristics in
the iNO patients were also not different from controls.
Patients were treated with a mean duration of 12 days.
Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of
death and BPD; however, for infants between 1000-
1250 g, iNO reduced BPD and death or BPD by 50%
(p<0.001) and 40% (p<0.004), respectively. INO
therapy also reduced the incidence of IVH, PVL or
ventriculomegaly from 24% to 17% (p=0.03) for the
entire group, but was most marked in the 750-999 g
substratum.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that low dose iNO
did not reduce the incidence of BPD for the overall
group, but reduced BPD by 50% in infants over 1000g
- 91 -
at birth. However, iNO markedly reduced signs of brain
injury for the overall group. Mechanisms underlying
these responses are uncertain, but likely reflect the
important influence of early versus later stages of lung
development among the premature newborns, and may
reflect distal organ effects of iNO therapy.
NOVEL DEVELOPMENTS IN VACCINOLOGY
R Moxon
Oxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics,
University of Oxford, UK
Immunisation is currently the most effective public
health tool for reducing the enormous global morbidity
and mortality from infections. In humans, effective
vaccines are second only to the availability of clean
water in terms of their impact on reducing the burden of
infections. In humans, vaccines have eliminated or
substantially reduced at least nine major viral and
bacterial infections. These successes must be viewed in
the context of the huge unmet challenges for which
novel developments in vaccines can provide enormous
benefits in the future. The challenge of providing
improved or novel vaccines comes at a time when the
rise in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance poses
diabolical problems and the global spread of pathogens
is increasingly facilitated by unprecedented population
densities in megacities, rapidity of travel, complex food
chains and the many natural and human- inflicted
disasters that disrupt societal infrastructures. This
discussion will focus selectively on some of the
potential opportunities provided by the application of
'cutting edge' science for the improvement of our current
vaccines and future development of novel vaccines.
VACCINATION AND OTITIS MEDIA
R Dagan
Pediatric Infectious Disease Unit, Soroka University
Medical Center and the Faculty of Health Sciences,
Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel
Background and Aims: Otitis media (OM) is the most
common bacterial infection in children aged < 5 years
for which antibiotic treatment is prescribed worldwide.
Although most of the time this entity resolves
spontaneously it is associated with morbidity, family
dysfunction, antibiotic use and burden on the medical
system. Efforts to reduce the burden of OM by
vaccination have not been extremely rewarding, but
some progress has been made. Methods: Review of the
topic. Results: The first obvious step would be to
reduce viral infections leading secondarily to OM. In the
modern era, the only viral vaccine with proven effect on
AOM is the influenza virus vaccine. Both the
inactivated and the live virus showed some effect, but
since influenza virus has only a limited season yearly
the effect on the overall OM rate is far from being
remarkable. Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) b vaccine did
not reduce OM since most Hi causing OM are
nontypable (NTHi) and not Hib. The newly developed
pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have all been
shown to reduce > 50% of the OM caused by the
serotypes included in the vaccines, but some
replacement with serotypes not included in the vaccines
and non pneumococcal organisms was demonstrated to
reduce the overall effect of pneumococcal vaccines. The
effect of PCV on the reduction of recurrent OM, OM
with effusion, the need for ventilation tubes and frequent
visits for AOM has been suggested, and the real impact
is still being studied. Aiming with PCV at those with
established recurrent OM has proved disappointing.
PCVs can reduce OM caused by antibiotic-resistant S.
pneumoniae but the continued overuse of antibiotics is
responsible for the increase in antibiotic resistance in
non-vaccine serotypes. A newly developed PCV with an
outer membrane protein for Hi (PnPD) is suggested to
reduce also OM caused by Hi, but confirmation studies
are needed. New protein vaccines with proteins for Hi,
S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis are under
development, but still far from being studied clinically.
Conclusions: Some vaccine can advance OM burden
but at least in the next 1-2 decades OM will continue to
be an important disease in children.

INFLAMMATION, PRETERM DELIVERY AND
THE CNS
H Hagberg
Perinatal Center, Sahlgrenska Academy, East Hospital,
KK, Goteborg, Sweden
Infection causes spontaneous preterm delivery
especially at low gestation (<30 weeks). These
infections can be in the urinary tract, peritoneal cavity
(appendicitis), oral cavity (periodontal disease) or be
systemic suggesting transplacental passage for some of
these infections. More commonly, however, microbes
are believed to ascend into the uterine cavity from the
lower genital tract. A maternal inflammation is induced
with infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the
chorioamniotic membranes and in the chorion plate of
the placenta. Eventually, inflammatory cells accumulate
also in the umbilical cord indicating a fetal
inflammatory response. Indeed, a multitude of cytokines
and chemokines accumulate in the cervicovaginal fluid,
amniotic fluid and fetal blood and the levels exhibit an
association with preterm delivery and neonatal
morbidity. Except for treatment of urinary tract
infections, antibiotic treatment of patients with bacterial
- 92 -
vaginosis or those presenting with preterm contractions
have not been successful in prolongation of pregnancy
or in reducing neonatal morbidity. This could be due to
1. that preterm birth has multiple causes and, hence,
only infectious-related preterm birth could be expected
to respond to anti-microbial treatment. 2. Infection
induces inflammation which is considered to be critical
for induction of preterm birth and neonatal organ
damage. Antibiotics may have to be combined with anti-
inflammatory therapies to be effective, e.g. progesterone
and corticosteroids have both proved beneficial and they
are both strong anti-inflammatory agents. 3. The
infectious/inflammatory process starts early in gestation
and treatment at the time of preterm contractions may be
too late. Indeed, it has been shown that the presence of
ureaplasma Urealyticym or increased cytokines in the
amniotic fluid at midgestation predict late
abortions/preterm birth. We hypothesize that such
chronic “low-intensity” inflammation during pregnancy
may be critical not only with respect to preterm birth but
also to long-term CNS development, vulnerability and
injury. Systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) in adult animals induces upregulation of
cytokines and activation of microglia in the brain, which
was accompanied by a substantial decrease in CNS
neurogenesis. High doses of LPS applied between the
chorio-amniotic membranes in pregnant mice at
embryonic day (ED) 15 (75% gestation) induces preterm
birth. However, much lower doses of LPS at ED 15 does
not induce preterm birth but elicits a chronic state of
CNS inflammation and the animals develop more
extensive brain lesions if later exposed to hypoxia-
ischemia during postnatal life (Wang et al. 2006).
Furthermore, maternal LPS induces inflammation,
hypomyelination and cell death in the brain of the
postnatal offspring. Intrauterine infection causes preterm
birth in a subset of patients. Clinical and experimental
studies suggest that the inflammatory process starts
early in gestation. The immuno-inflammatory activation
during pregnancy may have programming long-term
influences on CNS development and vulnerability.

Knowledge continues to accumulate from perinatal and
neonatal inflammation research suggesting that each
solution to a riddle in this field is accompanied by the
appearance of (at least two) new ones. This reminds us
of the mythical serpent Hydra, one of whose nine heads
was immortal. The beast quickly grew two new heads
for each one Hercules chopped off. Recent research
suggests that inflammatory processes play a role in
most, if not all, neonatal disorders of the brain, eye,
lung, and gut. Moreover, systemic inflammation issues
require close attention. We should not surrender to
complexity, but take it as a stimulation to move ahead.
The traditional view that the immune system's primary
task is to maintain health by fending off 'non-self' has
been challenged by Polly Matzinger (Science, 2002),
who suggests to give 'danger' the role of the offender.
Her model proposes that alarm signals from stressed
tissues rather than specific forms of antigen define the
design of the immune response. Although this theory
might explain some non-self-tolerance phenomena
rather elegantly, we are now obviously left with the task
to identify and characterize the alarm signals proposed
by the theory. Much of the danger theory revolves
around the mechanisms of adaptive immunity (i.e., T-
cell activation). Thus, we will need to clarify whether
the innate immune response itself constitutes a danger
signal, and how much of the danger signal we call
'inflammation' causes damage in and of itself. Finally,
we need to figure out how we can prevent the
consequences of such danger. For those who consider
adult medicine less than straight forward, fetal / neonatal
medicine might look like Wonderland - a strange world,
where almost nothing is to be taken at face value and
apparent paradoxes wait for us at every corner. Here are
three rather simplistic examples: antenatal infection
reduces postnatal respiratory distress, but increases the
risk for longterm bronchopulmonary dysplasia
(Watterberg et al, 1996); antenatal glucocorticoids
reduce the risk of developmental disability, while
neonatal glucocorticoids increase the risk (O'Shea &
Doyle, 2001); maternal, but not fetal, administration of
steroids reduce growth (Newnham et al, 1999). In this
presentation, we offer speculations about potential
future developments in perinatal and neonatal care in
order to begin planning preventive intervention. Much
of the work that needs to be done involves concepts
such as signal detection, characterization of danger, and
intervention design. Extreme caution needs to be exerted
when working on these issues, because inflammation
might (in part) be beneficial. Therefore, anti-
inflammatory strategies are likely to come from the
armamentarium of double-edged swords. According to
Greek mythology, Hydra was eventually killed only
because Iolaus helped his uncle to chop off the immortal
ninth head. Unfortunately, because Hercules had not
managed to do it all by himself, the success was not
counted towards his ten labors. Still, we believe that it
will take exactly this kind of teamwork to eventually
reduce the dangers brought to perinatal Wonderland by
inflammation.

Background and Aims: Resuscitation at birth with pure
oxygen is associated with long term detrimental effects.
We tested if there is a dose-response correlation
between oxygen level and subsequent changes in
antioxidant capacity and gene expression.
Methods: Piglets (12-36h) underwent hypoxia until BE-
20mmol/l or blood pressure <15mmHg, and were then
resuscitated for 15 min with 21%, 40%, 60% and 100%
oxygen (n=12, n=10, n=10, n=10, baseline n=10) and
thereafter observed for 1h. To study gene-expression we
used GeneChip® Porcine Genome Array. The
Microarrays were performed through isolation of RNA
from snap frozen lung tissue. DNA repair activities
counteracting the effect of base lesions on DNA,
including oxidative damages, were monitored in cell-
free protein-extracts.
Results: The 100%, 60%, 40% and 21% group had a
mean arterial pO2 value at respectively 41.7, 26.1, 20.0
and 12.4 kPa after 15min of resuscitation, (p<0.001).
Total-antioxidant-capacity were significantly lower in
lung-tissue from piglets resuscitated with 40, 60 or
100% oxygen compared to 21%, (p<0,02). The
Microarray-study in the room-air and 100% group,
showed significant difference in gene-expression
profiles for genes related to cell-replication and
inflammatory response. The capacity to repair base
lesions on DNA was significantly reduced after
resuscitation.
Conclusions: Hypoxia and subsequent resuscitation for
15 min with high percentage oxygen gives a dose
dependent hyperoxia with increased oxidative stress and
risk of cell damage and long term consequences such as
accumulation of mutations in the genome. Hyperoxia
leads to changes in expression of genes related to cell-
replication and inflammatory response compared to
room-air resuscitation.

Background and Aims: Inflammation due to perinatal
infection and asphyxia may cause damage to various
tissues and very often to the immature brain of the fetus
and the newborn. Previously we have shown that the
neonatal immune system has the ability to produce
increased chemokine protein levels in the serum during
the inflammatory response caused by perinatal infection
and asphyxia. The aim of our present study was to
investigate mRNA levels of the proinflammatory
chemokines IL-8 and MCP-1 in infected and
asphyxiated neonates.
Methods: Forty-two premature neonates were studied;
11 with perinatal infection (PI), 16 with perinatal
asphyxia (PA) and 15, without PA and PI, were used as
controls. IL-8 and MCP-1 mRNA levels were
investigated in whole blood and in PHA-activated
lymphocytes using semi-quantitative PCR and real time
PCR, respectively.
Results: IL-8 mRNA levels were significantly increased
in whole blood both during PA and PI, while MCP-1
mRNA levels were not. In vitro activated lymphocytes
expressed significantly increased IL-8 mRNA levels
during PI, whereas no increase was observed during PA.
MCP-1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in
activated lymphocytes during perinatal asphyxia while
no increase was observed during PI.
Conclusions: Our data show that chemokine mRNA
levels expressed by activated lymphocytes during
inflammation caused by perinatal infections are different
to those expressed during perinatal asphyxia. These
findings might have important implications during the
administration of specific chemokine antagonists in
order to prevent or reduce tissue damage caused by
inflammation.

Background and Aims: Exposure towards hyperoxia
and nitric oxide (NO) occur frequently during the
treatment of neonatal hypoxic pulmonary failure. To
analyse the response of neonatal polymorphonuclear
neutrophils (PMN) to hyperoxia and NO in vitro.
Methods: Neonatal cord blood was exposed to 100%
oxygen, NO 20ppm plus 100% oxygen, and NO 20ppm
for 30 minutes. Flow cytometry was used to quantify
production of nitric oxide by measurement of the
intracellular dye DAF-2 DA.
Results: DAF-2 DA signals following equilibration
with room air were used as controls. Exposure to 100%
oxygen increased NO production significantly when
compared to NO 20ppm plus 100% oxygen (p=0,031)
and to NO 20ppm alone (p=0,006).
Conclusions: Exposure of human PMN cells to
hyperoxia induces intracellular upregulation of
endogenous NO production, whereas exposure to
exogenous NO does not. Hyperoxia - whether in
combination with NO or not – can lead to NO-induced
apoptosis. This needs to be taken into account in the
treatment of clinical conditions requiring high
inspiratory concentrations of oxygen and/or inhaled NO.

Background and Aims: Several retrospective studies
have shown chorioamnionitis to be associated with
adverse neonatal outcome. However, findings have been
contradictory and despite the fact that chorioamnionitis
is an important cause of preterm delivery, few studies
have adjusted their data for gestational age. Our aim was
to compare short-term outcome parameters between
patients with and without chorioamnionitis in a large
prospective study.
Methods: Over a two-year period all infants born in the
Erasmus MC at 32 weeks gestation were prospectively
included in this study. Relevant clinical data and
placental histopathology were obtained from each
infant. Outcome parameters were compared between
infants with histological chorioamnionitis (HC) and
those without (non-HC).
Results: 303 Patients were included, 119 (39.3%) of
whom had HC. Patient characteristics and outcome
parameters are summarised in the table. After correction
for gestational age differences, the only relevant
outcome parameter significantly associated with HC
was NEC.
Conclusions: In this prospective study,
chorioamnionitis was not shown to be associated with
adverse neonatal outcome after correction for
gestational age. An increased incidence of NEC after
HC was found, but larger studies are needed to confirm
this association. Our findings are in contrast with earlier
retrospective studies, most of which have not adjusted
for gestational age. This study shows that the impact of
chorioamnionitis on short-term outcome is mainly
mediated through its causal relationship with preterm
delivery.

Background and Aims: Intrahepatic cholestasis of
pregnancy (ICP) is associated with an increased risk of
RDS in near term neonates. [1] The diagnosis of bile
acid pneumonia has been proposed on the basis of a
causative role of bile acids (BA) [2]. Because hyaline
membranes have been demonstrated in rabbits after
tracheal instillation of BA [3] we hypothesized that
abnormally high BA levels in ICP could reverse the
reaction of phospholipase-A2 in the alveoli, leading to a
lack of surfactant. Finding detectable BA in the lung of
affected infants could strongly support this hypothesis.
Methods: We measured BA levels in broncho-alveolar
lavage (BALF) of 4 neonates affected by BA pneumonia
and in 7 control infants, matched for gestational age,
who required mechanical ventilation for reasons
different from lung diseases. BA were analyzed, as
previously published, [4] in the first day of life.
Maternal and neonatal plasma BA levels were also
recorded.
Results: BA were detected in BALF of infants affected
by BA pneumonia (median: 0.77 mol/l; i.q. range:
0.43-2.8; p < 0.001) and were absent in controls.
Conclusions: Newborn infants from normal pregnancies
do not have BA in the lungs. Our study demonstrates
that abnormally high BA during ICP pregnancies pass
into the alveoli of the newborn and produce a secondary
surfactant deficiency reversing the phospholipase-A2
reaction.
LUNG HEALING IN ARDS: ROLE OF ION
CHANNELS
U H Thome
Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulm, Germany
Background and Aims: The prenatal lung works as an
exocrine gland and secretes fluid, which contributes to
amniotic fluid and facilitates lung growth. After birth,
fluid secretion has to cease as any excess fluid in the
alveolar space will hamper gas exchange. Furthermore,
excess fluid must be absorbed out of the alveolar space
(alveolar fluid clearance). This is one of the most
important processes in the transition to extrauterine life,
and continuously thereafter. Expression of fluid by the
birth canal is of minor importance. Cell physiologic and
animal studies have elucidated the transport mechanisms
and carrier proteins involved. Sodium ions are taken up
by alveolar type II cells, previously known as the
producers of surfactant, through epithelial sodium
channels located in the apical membrane, and are
actively extruded into the interstitial space by Na, K-
ATPases in the basolateral membrane. Water follows
passively the resulting osmotic forces. The fluid is
removed from the interstitial space by blood capillaries
and lymph vessels.
Methods: In respiratory distress syndrome, impaired
epithelial transport and increased epithelial leakage
result in increased alveolar fluid content, leading to
impaired gas exchange and surfactant inactivation.
- 95 -
Clinical studies have shown that the survival of patients
suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome is
dependent on the activity of their alveolar fluid
clearance. Likewise, the severity of respiratory distress
in premature infants is linked to the activity of epithelial
sodium transport mechanisms.
Results: Alveolar fluid clearance is currently much less
amenable by therapeutic intervention than surfactant
deficiency. Research has been directed towards potential
therapies to stimulate alveolar fluid clearance and
improve the clinical outcome of patients with severe
lung failure. Potential therapies include such diverse
options as beta-receptor agonists, steroid hormones,
potassium channel activators, diuretics, and transfer of
various genes by viral vectors. All these options are
currently under investigation in cell culture experiments,
animal and human studies. While there is not yet an
established therapy available, the first promising
randomized trial has been published this year.
Conclusions: The importance of alveolar fluid
clearance for surviving severe lung failure is
increasingly recognized. The mechanisms have been
elucidated, and therapies to improve alveolar fluid
clearance are under investigation.
SURFACTANT IN PEDIATRIC ARDS
L Gortner
Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital,
Homburg, Germany
Background and Aims: Secondary surfactant
deficiency and increased pulmonary vasculare are the
mainstays of pediatric ARDS. This disorder still is
characterized by a substantial mortality and se-vere
long-term sequelae. It was thus the aim, to assess the
efficacy of surfactant treat-ment in pediatric ARDS after
having established its efficacy in neonates with RDS.
Methods: Two controlled clinical trials have been
conducted, investigating natural surfactant preparations
in pediatric ARDS (1, 2), a number of studies described
its effects in case-series, however, without enrolling
controls.
Results: Main endpoint in study 1 was improvement in
oxygenation (pao2/Fio2) at 48 hours, in study 2
ventilator free days and mortality. In study 1 improved
oxygenation was observed in surfactant treated children,
however, mortality and days on the ventilator were
unchanged between both groups. In study 2, ventilator
free days were not significantly different between both
groups, however, mor-tality was increased in the
placebo group (OR1.32/CI1.15 - 4.85). In both studies,
im-proved oxygenation was observed within the first
hours of the surfactant treatment. Mean mortality in both
studies was 23% in surfactant treated children (23/97)
compared with 40% (36/90) in the control group.
Response to and mortality after surfactant seemed to be
influenced most prominently in primary ARDS
compared to secondary ARDS, i.e. isolated ARDS
without underlying severe illness.
Conclusions: Further trials with clearly defined
subgroups of children with primary ARDS should be
carried out in order to better describe the effect of
surfactant treatment in pediatric ARDS. 1. Möller JC,

Background and Aims: In the etiology of damage to
the immature brain, RDS-induced disturbances in
cerebral oxygenation, hemodynamics and lack of
cerebral autoregulation play an important role. To
examine the effect of the type of ventilatory support
(CPAP, SIMV, HFOV) on cerebral oxygenation, brain
perfusion and activity, arterial O2 saturation (SaO2),
NIRS-determined cerebral O2-supply (ScO2) and O2-
extraction (FTOE: (SaO2-ScO2/SaO2)), blood pressure
(MABP) and amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) were
monitored during the first 72 hours of life.
Methods: From 36 preterms (GA <32 wks) with
surfactant-dependent RDS 10, 14 and 12 were treated
with CPAP with InSurE procedure (Intubation,
Surfactant, Ectubation), synchronized intermittend
mandatory ventilation (SIMV) or high frequency
oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) respectively. From each
patient an average of a 60 min reliable monitoring
period was used every 6 hours (from birth up to day 3)
for SaO2, ScO2, FTOE, MABP and aEEG. Correlation
coefficients between MABP and ScO2 and between
MABP and FTOE were determined every 15 min to
detect possible lack of autoregulation.
Results: In CPAP/InSurE infants were signifantly
higher MABPs and aEEg-activity, ScO2 and FTOE
showed a clearly higher and lower trend respectively
and there were less periods of significant correlations
between MABP and ScO2/FTOE as compared to
SIMV/HFOV infants.
Conclusions: RDS-treatment using CPAP/InSurE was
associated with a better cerebral oxygenation, more
stable blood pressures and less periods of lack of
cerebral autoregulation.

- 96 -
Background and Aims: Furosemide, a potent inhibitor
of Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC), has been used
repetitively for neonates with pulmonary disease. In
airway smooth muscle cells it was suggested, that
Furosemide inhibits cell proliferation. Yet the effect of
Furosemide on alveolar epithelial cell proliferation has
not been studied.
Methods: NKCC expression and distribution in alveolar
epithelial cells (A549 cells) were assessed by
immunoblotting and -staining. To test the effect of
Furosemide on cell proliferation, alveolar epithelial cells
(A549-cells) were cultured with Furosemide, at 0-1200
μM. At 96 hours proliferation was determined by cell
count related to seeded cells. Cell DNA-content was
studied in permeabilized cells by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) using propidium iodide.
Proliferating cells were defined as high-DNA-cells
(double DNA content, G2 / mitotic), whereas low DNA-
cells were assumed to be in G1-phase.
Results: On both immunoblot and immunostaining
NKCC was abundantly expressed in the cells. On
confocal microscopy cotransporter was located to the
basolateral membrane of the cells. Cell count after 96
hours decreased significantly with increased Furosemide
concentration. Cell DNA analysis showed an increase of
cells in G1-phase with increased Furosemide. Proportion
of proliferating cells (G2 / mitotic) decreased
significantly with Furosemide concentration.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that Furosemide, at
concentrations comparable to those after Furosemide-
instillation, inhibits cell proliferation of alveolar
epithelial cells in vitro. However cellular mechanisms of
inhibition remain unclear. According to our data the
application of Furosemide to the premature lung (e.g. in
small infants) might influence lung development, yet
further studies are mandatory.

Background and Aims: Many infants who are
extubated after initial surfactant administration require
reintubation. Repeated or prolonged reintubation may
place them at higher risk of adverse outcomes. We
examined extubation and reintubation rates and their
impact on key clinical outcomes in infants treated with
lucinactant vs colfosceril and beractant from the
SELECT trial (Moya, et al. Pediatrics. 2005;115:1018)
and vs poractant from the STAR trial (Sinha, et al.
Pediatrics. 2005;115:1030).
Methods: The rates of initial extubation, subsequent
reintubation, and death or BPD were compared using
logistic regression adjusted for birth weight stratum and
center.
Results: Overall rates of extubation were similar across
treatments in both trials (range 80.6%-83.9% for all
randomized neonates; P=ns). The reintubation rate
following initial extubation was significantly lower
(P<.05) for infants treated with lucinactant compared
with beractant or poractant (Table). Proportionally more
lucinactant-treated infants who were extubated survived
compared with other surfactants, but this difference did
not reach significance. Survival without BPD at 36 wk
PMA among infants extubated favored lucinactant vs
colfosceril (72.2% vs 66.0%, P=.034).
Conclusions: Initial extubation rates were similar
among infants treated with lucinactant and other
surfactants; the rate of subsequent reintubation was
significantly lower with lucinactant. Major morbidity
and mortality in reintubated patients also were lower
with lucinactant, mirroring primary observations
previously reported. Supported by Discovery

Intensive Care, Children's Hospital, Luzern, Switzerland
Background and Aims: As inhaled therapy in preterm
infants with IRDS (Infant Respiratory Distress
Syndrome) or CLD (Chronic Lung Disease) is difficult,
the current therapy consists of Surfactant instilled
through a tracheal tube or systemic steroids applied
orally or intravenously. Current commercially available
inhalation devices are not suitable for this age group.
New mesh devices able to produce very small particles
may allow age specific aerosol therapy and may be
applicable even in preterm infants. This in vitro study
assesses the particle size of nebulised aerosols and the
distribution in the upper airways and estimates a
predicted lung dose for preterm infants.
Methods: Budesonide was nebulised through a standard
e-Flow device (Pari GmbH, Starnberg, Germany) with
two different perforated vibrating membranes (3.5μm
and 2.5μm pore diameter) attached to an upper airway
model of a 32 weeks gestational age preterm infant by a
face mask followed by an NG (New Generation)
impactor. Particle size distribution as well as lung dose
were expressed as a percentage of the total dose and
assessed using an HPLC-method.
Results: Median mass aerodynamic diameter (MMAD)
of particles reaching the lungs was 1.6μm with a
geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 1.5. Comparison
- 97 -
of the two membranes showed a lung deposition of 17%
± 1.055 and 23% ± 1.087 for the greater (3.5μm) and
smaller (2.5μm) pores, respectively.
Conclusions: The difference between the two
membranes is statistically significant (Mann-Whitney-
U-Test, p<0.0001). Furthermore, we conclude that
aerosols applied to preterm infants of 32 weeks of
gestational age should have a MMAD of <1.6μm.

Background and Aims: Diaphragmatic hernia (DH) is
associated with high mortality and morbidity. Fetal
tracheal occlusion (FETO) has been suggested to
accelerate lung growth and development in DH. We
evaluated the effect of FETO on lung growth and
postnatal lung tissue mechanics.
Methods: Left sided DH was surgically created in fetal
rabbits at 23 days of gestation (term 31 days). 5 days
later, FETO was performed and compared to non-FETO
and sham operated animals. At term, fetuses were
delivered by cesarean section. Lung to body weight ratio
(LBWR), total lung capacity (TLC), dynamic
compliance (Crs) and resistance (Rrs) were measured. In
addition we measured lung input impedance by forced
oscillation technique (FOT) and lung tissue elastance
(HL), tissue resistance (GL), hysteresivity eta (GL/HL)
and small airway resistance (Raw) were calculated from
impedance data.
Results: LBWR was significantly increased in FETO-
animals compared to DH (0.024 ±0.006 vs. 0.010±0.004
g/g, p=0.005). FETO increased TLC from 16.3±2.6 to
19.6±3.7 (p=0.1) and significantly increased Crs but had
no effect on Rrs. FETO had no effect on HL but resulted
in increased GL. In contrast, FETO resulted in a
significant decrease of Rn in these animals.
Conclusions: These data suggest that changes of Crs in
DH, due to FETO are rather a result of small airway and
lung volume distention. According to our data, FETO
potentially increases resistive forces of lung tissue
(Gtiss). In our rodent DH-model FETO does not affect
lung tissue elastance, deteriorated by DH.

Department of Pediatric Intensive Care, Erasmus MC-
Sophia, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: In critically ill children
hyperglycaemia (>8 mmol/L) is associated with an
increased mortality but it is not known if insulin therapy
will improve outcome. Aim of the study was to evaluate
a hyperglycaemic treatment protocol trying to lower
blood glucose < 8 mmol/L within 12 hours after start of
insulin treatment in critically ill children admitted to the
PICU.
Methods: Retrospective evaluation of the incidence and
treatment of hyperglycaemia of all children admitted to
the PICU in relation to the glucose intake.
Results: In a 4 months period in 80 non-diabetic
children blood glucose control was done within 24 hours
after admission to the PICU. In 33/80 of the children
blood glucose was initially >8 mmol/L (mean 10,5
mmol/L). The glucose intake in only 5 children was
according to the protocol (in 6 too high and in 22 too
low). Excluded for treatment were 20 children because a
second blood glucose was normalised (13x) and various
other reasons (7x). The mean interval between the first
and second blood glucose control was 120 min. Eight
children were treated according the protocol. Mean
duration of treatment was 55 hours (range 8-128 hr). In
7 of the 8 children within 12 hours (mean 10,5 hr) blood
glucose was <8 mmol/L. No hypoglycaemia occurred.
Conclusions: In a high percentage of children admitted
to the PICU hyperglycaemia was present but treatment
was done in a selected group safely. The glucose intake
was only in 15% according the protocol. The awareness
of blood glucose control needs more attention.

Clinical Research Department, Laurel, MD, USA
Background and Aims: Thermoregulation is a critical
component of neonatal care. Yet many of the practices
surrounding thermoregulation have not been re-tested
despite the marked changes in viability has over the last
4 decades. With this foundation, one should realize that
approximately 50% of global NICUs practice baby-
control philosophies of thermoregulation while the rest
practice an air-control philosophy. Is the evidence base
all that is should or could be?
Methods: Thirty preterm infants < 1500g were
randomized to either Giraffe baby control mode or
Giraffe air control mode. The Giraffe was set-up and
pre-warmed according to manufacturer’s guidelines in
closed bed/incubator/manual mode. The initial thermal
goal was to maintain central skin temperature at 36.5
- 98 -
degrees C in both groups and rectal temperature within a
range of 36.8 to 37.3 degrees C. Added humidity was
controlled at 60-80%. Physiological variables were
measured each minute over the period of data collection.
Results: The table demonstrates key outcomes in this
study population.
Conclusions: In this study, baby control seems to
provide better control of preterm newborn infant
temperature as compared to air control.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PROGRAMME TO

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN RISK
MANAGEMENT
I M Thruston, L Singharam Chettair, J Enterkin
Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Evelina Childrens'
Hospital, Guys' and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust,
London, UK
Background and Aims: Patients deserve and expect
safe care and the identification and prevention of
adverse incidents has become an important part of
Clinical Governance. Errors are usually complex and
caused or exacerbated by many interacting causes.
People make mistakes and poor systems increase the
likelihood of error. Reporting and monitoring of adverse
incidents helps facilitate learning and allow the direction
of future preventative strategies.
Methods: A strategy developed and introduced by the
PICU Education and Management teams, to reduce
adverse incidents, is a programme to increase staffs'
awareness of their roles and responsibilities in risk
management. The programme includes presentations
from the National Patient Safety Agency and the Trust
Clinical Risk Team, feedback of local adverse incident
follow up and analysis, group work and presentation of
their work. Group work may involve a snapshot audit of
prescription errors, for example, from which the group
will then identify a project they will undertake over
several months. Their projects will include findings and
proposed action plans and they will present their work to
the rest of the PICU team by way of oral and poster
presentations.
Results: Staff report; increased awareness of the
benefits of reporting and monitoring actual or potential
incidents, increased motivation to participate in action
planning of preventative strategies and the development
of skills and experience of change management. The
programme has been well evaluated.
Conclusions: The programme has the effect of staff
having a better understanding of the causes of adverse
incidents and becoming more aware of the risk
management process.

(NICU's) in The Netherlands; and to identify underlying
system factors of incidents related to medication,
mechanical ventilation and vascular catheters.
Methods: Study design: Prospective multicenter study.
In July 2005, voluntary, non-anonymous, non-punitive
incident reporting was introduced in eight level III
NICU's and one paediatric surgical intensive care. An
incident was defined as any unintended event which
(could have) reduced the safety margin for the patient.
Multidisciplinary committees analysed incidents
pertaining to medication, intravascular catheters and
mechanical ventilation for underlying root causes, using
the PRISMA methodology ( statistics of 0.68 for inter-
rater reliability). We describe results of the first six
months of reporting.
Results: There were 2728 incident reports describing
2804 incidents, among 1853 admissions. The figure
shows incident categories with frequencies. Death was
attributed to an incident in two patients. Thirty-one
patients experienced major harm with expected
increased hospital stay, mainly due to incidents relating
to mechanical ventilation (7/31) and intravascular
catheters (7/31). Out of 2067 minor incidents, 585
(28%) had the potential to cause major harm. Root
causes consisted of 8% technical, 27% organizational,
62% human and 3% patient-related failures.
Conclusions: A specialty-based, multicenter database
can identify useful information about the etiology and
severity of incidents in a short period of time, creating
the opportunity for system-oriented preventive
strategies.

NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION DURING
PREGNANCY AND LACTATION
R Bergmann
Department of Pediatrics, Charité Virchow Klinikum,
Berlin, Germany
The nutritional status of pregnant and lactating women
has implications not only for their own health, but also
for that of their infants. The consequences of insufficient
or excessive intake of macro- and micro-nutrients
influence the outcome of pregnancy, and may also have
long-term effects on the health of the child and the
future adult. An optimal supply of all important vitamins
and minerals is thus essential for pregnant women. Their
requirements with respect to a number of vitamins and
minerals are considerably higher than those of women
who are not pregnant. As these additional requirements
cannot always be satisfied by a normal diet - even in
societies with an abundance of food - micronutrient
deficiencies occur (hidden hunger), and since detailed
individualised nutritional supply levels cannot always be
verified, dietary supplements seem advisable for all
pregnant women. These supplements may even contain
'functional foods'; foodstuffs whose function goes
beyond simply covering nutritional requirements, and
which are beneficial to the health of the mother and her
infant. The presentation will address the nutrients of
special relevance for the pregnant woman and the fetus,
and also their importance as supplements during
pregnancy.
ABSORBING OR METABOLIZING? THE ROLE
OF THE NEONATAL GUT WITH REGARD TO
THE DIET
J B van Goudoever
Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology,
Sophia Children's Hospital, Erasmus Medical Center,
Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: The portal-drained viscera
(stomach, intestine, pancreas and spleen) have a much
higher rate of both energy expenditure and protein
synthesis than can be estimated on the basis of their
weight. A high utilization rate of dietary nutrients by the
portal-drained viscera might result in a low systemic
availability, which determines whole-body growth.
Methods: From studies in our multiple catheterisized
piglet model we conclude that more than half of the
dietary protein intake is utilized within the portal-
drained viscera and that amino acids are a major fuel
source for the visceral organs.
Results: Specific stable isotope studies reveal that there
are large differences in utilization rate amongst the
different amino acids. The majority of the results
obtained from the piglet studies can be extrapolated to
the human (preterm) infant. First-pass, splanchnic
uptake of lysine and threonine differ substantially, while
non-essential amino acids are oxidized to a great extend
in the human gut. Methionine is an important precursor
of intestinally derived homocysteine.
Conclusions: Overall, these studies indicate that gut
amino acid metabolism has a great impact on systemic
availability and hence growth and health in the neonate.
FEEDING THE EXTREMELY LOW BIRTH
WEIGHT INFANT
R J Cooke
Division of Neonatology, University of Tennessee
Center for Health Sciences, Memphis, TN, USA
Nutrition plays a critical role during growth and
development; the greater the growth rate the more
critical the role, and none more so than that between 24
weeks of gestation and 2-3 months postnatal age, a time
when even short periods of malnutrition has long term
effects on growth and development. Studies show that
under-nutrition and growth retardation are universal in
preterm infants; the more immature the infant the
greater the degree of under-nutrition and growth
retardation. Whether this is entirely preventable or not is
unclear. What is clear is that there are 'critical periods' in
a preterm infant's life during which the extent of under-
nutrition and, therefore, growth retardation might be
minimized, thus improving outcome in these high-risk
infants.
MAKING OF THE BRAIN: GENETIC AND
EPIGENETIC REGULATIONS. FROM
MOLECULAR BIOLOGY TO CONSCIOUSNESS
J-P Changeux
Institut Pasteur, Paris, France
In the course of human evolution, the complexity of
brain connectivity increasesd dramatically, while that of
the genome did not change significantly. Several genetic
mechanisms may plausible account for this paradoxical
non-linear relationship such as the spatiotemporal and
combinatorial action of developmental genes ie
homeotic genes, microcephaly genes and/or several
others. Alternatively, the state of activity
(evoked/spontaneous) of the developing brain, during
foetal life and in the newborn, may contribute to the
development of brain organisation via ' epigenetic '
mechanisms such as the selective
stabilisation/elimination of developing synapses. Still,
such processes are expected to be limited by a ' genetic
envelope' which may include genes like those
responsible for dyslexia, autism or fragile-X mental
retardation. The mechanism of epigenesis by selective
stabilisation of synapses was investigated using
molecular biology techniques with the nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), the best known
neurotransmitter-gated ion channel. Studies with mice
deleted for defined subunits of the nAChR revealed a
contribution of the spontaneous activity of the retina to
the development of the adult visual pathways and maps.
Moreover, the analysis of the transcriptional regulation
of nAChR genes by electrical activity/neurotrophic
factors during motor endplate morphogenesis
established causal links between membrane electrical
activity and nAChR genes promoters through
- 100 -
transcription factors and second messenger pathways. In
the brain, an efficient in vivo method involving the
selective reexpression of defined genes by stereotaxic
injections of lentiviral vectors is used to investigate the
plasticity of adult brain circuits in cognitive learning.
The importance of epigenetic regulation of synapse
development (and its pathologies) in early learning
processes, in cognitive and/or conscious functions and
in cultural evolution, is discussed in the case of the
development of the newborn infant and its pathologies
such as autism, ADHD, sudden infant death disease.

MECHANISM OF BRAIN INJURY AND
NEUROPROTECTION
R C Tasker
Department of Paediatrics, Cambridge University
Clinical School and Department of Paediatric Intensive
Care, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK
Background and Aims: There are a number of
mechanisms that appear to contribute to brain injury
occurring after focal and global ischaemia. Experimental
models have improved our understanding of
neuropathology and support a glutamate hypothesis of
hypoxic-ischaemic brain damage. Substantial evidence
indicates that antagonists of ion channel-linked
glutamate receptors can reduce damage. In focal
ischaemia, this is true for both N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) antagonists and for non-NMDA
(kainate/AMPA) antagonists. In such models, the
magnitude of infarct reduction is typically in the order
of 25 to 30%. Moving away from the direct effect of the
receptor, there are either upstream or downstream sites
for drug action. For example, upstream, glibenclamide
(acting at the ATP sensitive potassium channel)
prolongs the period over which hypoxia can be
tolerated. Alternatively, downstream, dantrolene (acting
at the endoplasmic reticulum to limit NMDA-initiated,
calcium-mediated, calcium release from the ER pool)
limits the induction of apoptosis.
Methods: To date, many pharmacological approaches,
or combination of approaches, have been applied to
animal models, with beneficial effects, which promise
efficacy in patients. The NMDA receptor story, although
teaching us much about pathophysiology, is an example
where basic science has failed to deliver a significant
clinical outcome. However, when it comes to extending
experimental studies to clinical research trials there are
some key questions.
Results: A variety of promising, strongly
neuroprotective, agents have been identified by studies
in animal models. Despite this advance, translation to
clinical practice has not been forthcoming.
Unfortunately, the process of converting a promising
drug effect in the laboratory to a clinically useful test
product may be fraught with difficulty. (1) Do we know
that the agent is getting to the site where we think its
mechanism of action takes place? (2) Do we understand
the mechanism of how a drug or agent is acting in a
given experimental model? Although perhaps obvious,
this may not always be the case. (3) Does the ability to
protect neurons in one animal model extrapolate to
similar activity in other animal models? (4) Man may
exhibit important differences to the experimental model
in relation to disease-, anatomy-, sex- or age-specific
factors. (5) Laboratory studies are biased towards
inducing poorer outcomes, as this makes quantification
easier. (6) Issues concerning the drug itself: What are its
effects in the human being?; Can it cross the blood-brain
barrier?, How is it metabolised?; What are the
interactions?; Is it protein bound? etc.
Conclusions: There are now other areas of acute
neurotoxicity that are gaining interest in the wider field
of neuroprotection from hypoxia-ischaemia. These
include a role for: (1) The cerebral inflammatory
response, (2) Ischaemic preconditioning and ischaemic
tolerance, and (3) The pH paradox.
PAIN: NOT ONLY THE BRAIN
P G Jorens

Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital of Antwerp,
Edegem, Belgium
Background and Aims: Addressing pain, an inevitable
phenomenon from birth until death, in infants and
children is an important task for health care workers.
Although some progress has been made, many children
do not receive adequate attention to their pain.
Methods: Current literature highlights a significant
deficiency in our ability to assess pain, to understand the
physiopathology and the pharmacokinetics and
dynamics of analgesic drugs in this population A review
of the topic and the current literature is given.
Results: Children involved in trauma and undergoing
major surgery need fast and effective analgesia. Painful
procedures are the principal memory in survivors of
childhood cancer. However, also neuropathic pain and
other forms of chronic pain affect a large number of
children. Children with a variety of genetic disorders
may develop chronic pain as their life progresses. The
reasons for a low availability of data in children are
widespread. The diversity and developmental range of
the paediatric population have enormous implications
for the design and conduct of clinical research and the
interpretation of research findings. Inappropriate pain
assessment is likely to be an important contributor to the
poor pain management in children. The problem of
differentiating postoperative pain from fear and anger in
toddlers …. Nursing and physician alike remain
confused as to the dividing line between conscious
sedation and pure pain management. The traditional
definitions of pain require self-reporting: a contributing
factor is the children’s difficulty in expressing their pain
- 101 -
to those taking care of them in a way that is understood.
Behaviour is a useful measure and indicator of pain in
neonates and infants and a behavioural pain assessment
tool might be necessary. Whatever scale is used, it is
important but frequently neglected to ensure that it is
appropriate for the cognitive development, personality
and condition of the child. Incorporating both
pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies is
as necessary in children as in adults. Hardly any
paediatric data are available on pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of many drugs and are usually
extrapolated from adult data. Recent but limited
characterisation of the developmental pharmacokinetics
of opioid analgesics, paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs has however improved dosing in
children. Oral solutions can now be used in neonates.
Intravenous paracetamol offers increased dosing
accuracy. Moreover, the paediatric population has
access to unique formulations: the use of topical creams
of a local anaesthetic, otic analgesia and rectal
administration, although many children dislike the latter
route.
Conclusions: As it is recently recognised that pain and
its management may have consequences for later pain-
related behaviour and perception, all human beings have
the right to adequate pain control whether they can self-
report or not. There is an enormous potential for future
research and a pressing need for further clinical
development in the field of paediatric pain. Current
recommendations are frequently not based on the
highest possible level of evidence. Although pain
measurement and treatment has progressed substantially
over the last decade, improvement in all aspects of pain
documentation in children is needed to improve pain
management and probably outcomes in this precious
population.
THE ASSESSMENT OF PAIN IN PRE- OR NON-
VERBAL CHILDREN
L S Franck
Professor and Chair of Children's Nursing Research,
Centre for Nursing and Allied Health Professions
Research, Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond
Street Hospital for Children, London, UK
Despite over 30 years of research regarding
measurement of pain in infants and children, there is no
consensus regarding the optimal measures for research
or to guide clinical management. At last count, there
were over 40 published assessment scales for measuring
pain in infants and children in the hospital setting. While
it has been generally recognized that pain is a complex
multidimensional experience, attention in pediatric pain
measurement studies has remained largely focused on
pain intensity, to the exclusion of measuring the
meaning of the pain and its affective and behavioral
consequences. There are numerous tools for assessment
of acute pain in infants, but few have been shown to be
valid for assessment of persistent pain or postoperative
pain in critically children. More worrying, there remains
minimal integration of pain measurement with pain
treatment. Pain intensity scores have been successfully
used to demonstrate the efficacy of analgesics in clinical
trials. However, none of the published assessment scales
provide evidence for implementing one treatment versus
another for any given pain score. Possibly as a
consequence of that lack of evidence, there is low
compliance with pain assessment documentation in
many units that have implemented standardized scales.
If the measurement of pain does not lead to a treatment
decision, and the effectiveness of that decision is not
demonstrated by a meaningful change in the scale, what
is the utility of the measure? Recent research suggests
that specific behavioral and physiological indicators are
valid and reliable proxy measures for pain in non-verbal
children. The best indicators may vary based on age,
severity of illness, degree of neurological impairment,
context and type of observer (healthcare professional or
parent. Nevertheless, numerous challenges remain in
discriminating pain-related signs of distress from other
etiologies. Recommendations for pain assessment in
preverbal children will be suggested based on current
evidence.
NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL PAIN
MANAGEMENT IN THE INFANT AND CHILD
I Harth
PICU, Children's Hospital Johannes Gutenberg
University, Mainz, Germany
Background and Aims: Critically ill children and
infants might experience a stay on a PICU with a lot of
stressors which may cause pain, discomfort and
suffering. Providing comfort to these patients is a core
duty of the nursing profession. Optimal pain
management is based on a holistic approach which
includes the set up of a proper pain diagnosis according
to the child’s individual needs and its developmental
level and it considers both pharmacological and non-
pharmacological interventions.
Results: Aim of this lecture is to show up not only the
different techniques of non-pharmacological pain
management. From a broader perspective some basic
but important aspects of non-pharmacological pain
management have found their place i.e. in the creation
of a family friendly PICU environment or in the
definition of primary nursing care goals.
Conclusions: Non-pharmacological pain management
methods are well documented in literature and belong to
one of the two supporting pillars of pain relief.
However, pharmacological and non-pharmacological
pain management should never replace one with another
but should be applied in synergy.

Paediatric ICU, Great Ormond Street Hospital for
Sick Children, London, UK
Background and Aims: The Glasgow Coma Scale is
not always easy to score and its reliability has been
questioned. We hypothesised that the Motor subscore
would be at least as effective in predicting outcome
from coma in children.
Methods: CATS provides emergency secondary
transport of critically ill children (UK). During a 9-
month period we studied all patients with altered
consciousness, not caused by drugs, chronic disease,
convulsions or cardio-respiratory failure. For each case
we collected the GCS at referral or pre-intubation.
Outcome was evaluated upon discharge using a three
level ordinal scale (adapted from Fiser DH, J. Ped.
1992; 121:68-74).
Results: 113 patients were identified but in 49 adequate
data were not available. There were no significant
differences between cases with and without adequate
data for inclusion. Of the 64 cases 32 were neurotrauma
patients, 32 had other reasons for altered consciousness:
CNS infection, diabetic ketoacidosis…. Outcome was
good in 44 patients; 8 showed moderate to severe
disability; 12 died. Proportional odds models were fitted
for various choices of predictive variables: GCS, age,
diagnosis…. For each we calculated Somers' Dxy as a
measure of the predictive accuracy of the model. Overall
the difference between all models was small. The
highest Dxy value (0.852) was found for the model with
the GCS Motor score included linearly.
Conclusions: The Motor subscore has at least the same
predictive ability as the total GCS. It is our opinion that,
especially in children, the total GCS is unnecessary
complicated.
VALUE OF REPEAT CT SCANNING FOR
INVESTIGATION OF INTRACTABLE
INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION IN
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY
L E Loh, Q Mok
Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street
Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: Patients with traumatic brain
injury (TBI) frequently require urgent repeat CT scans
to determine if there is a surgically treatable cause for
their intractable intracranial hypertension. This involves
transfer of the ventilated patient from the intensive care
unit to the scanning suite, with its antecedent risks. The
aim of the study was to determine how frequently these
CT scans showed abnormalities where surgery could
have improved intracranial hypertension refractory to
medical intervention, and if there were clinical
parameters that could predict this.
Methods: This was a retrospective study of patients
admitted to our tertiary pediatric intensive care unit
(PICU) with TBI requiring intracranial pressure (ICP)
monitoring. Patient notes, computerised observation
charts and CT scans were reviewed. Scans were reported
independently by neuroradiologists not involved in the
patients’ clinical care.
Results: 88 patients with TBI requiring ICP monitoring
were admitted in the 5 years between 2000-2005 to the
PICU. The majority had urgent repeat CT scanning
because of persistently raised ICP. This led to surgical
intervention in only 7 (8%) patients. In all these patients
this requirement could have been predicted from
haemodynamic variables and other signs suggestive of
uncal herniation.
Conclusions: In the majority of patients repeat CT
scans did not show any abnormality that resulted in a
change in management strategy. In patients that required
surgical intervention following CT scanning, there were
clear signs suggestive of early uncal herniation. This
may be useful in predicting clinically who could benefit
from surgical intervention and minimise unnecessary
transfers for scans.
THE INFLUENCE OF PRE-
CARDIOPULMONARY CEREBRAL
RESUSCITATION FACTORS ON SURVIVAL
RATE IN CHILDREN
G van Berlaer, V Van Gorp, S Hachimi-Idrissi
Department of Pediatric Critical Care, Academical
Hospital, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium
Background and Aims: The outcome of children after
resuscitation for cardiopulmonary arrest is poor. Our
aim is to describe a large pediatric population who
developed a pre-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest
(PCPA) and to outline the influence of the pre-
cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPCR) factors
on survival rate. An evaluation is made of the influence
of applied CPCR guidelines on these children’s
outcome.
Methods: From 1991 till 2005, clinical records of all
patients younger than 16 years with PCPA were
reviewed. All data were prospectively registered using a
uniform standard registry, and adjusted to the Utstein
style report. The studied pre-CPCR factors were
restricted to age, site and cause of PCPA, bystander
CPCR, time to intubation and to administration of drugs,
initial cardiac rhythm and respiratory pattern on arrival
of the mobile intensive care unit team.
Results: Out of all registered patients with prehospital
cardiopulmonary arrest, we review all children. We
present the most common sites and causes of PCPA, the
number of attempted CPCR and achievement of
restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). We
compare the influence of initial cardiac rhythms and
initial respiratory patterns on the percentage of ROSC
and regaining of consciousness. We compare results of
CPCR performed by lay bystanders or by EMS-
personnel, skilled in pediatric life support, to study the
influence on survival rate and neurological outcome.
Conclusions: Rapid intervention and resuscitation by
EMS-bystanders skilled in pediatric life support
increases survival rate and neurological outcome in
- 103 -
children. Therefore CPCR training, appropriate
equipment and rapid intervention are mandatory.
TRANSPORT OF NEWBORNS WITH ACUTE
LUNG FAILURE ON ECMO
F Loersch, S T Hien, M Kratz, S Demirakca,
C H v. Buch, S T Loff, T H Schaible
NICU, University Childrens Hospital, Mannheim,
Germany
Background and Aims: Although ventilation and
postpartal management of sick newborns has been
optimized, ECMO remains a therapeutic option in the
neonatal intensive care of acute lung failure. The
ECMO-center Mannheim has performed about 281
ECMO cases since 1987, and currently performs about
25 ECMOs per year. 50 infants per year are evaluated
for the option of ECMO therapy. Half of them are born
at the center and the others are transported to the ECMO
center. Some children are too ill for conventional
transport, in which case transport using mobile ECMO
is necessary.
Results: 2005 we have installed a special Transport-
ECMO unit on a normal Ferrno Transport system in our
ECMO-center, which can be used in a standard
ambulance or helicopter. On the unit we use a
rollerpump (NovaCirc), a Stephan ventilator, a heating
pump (Aquatherm 660) and 6 perfusion pumps. Energy
is generated by a UPSU (uninterrupted power supply
unit). During the transport the energy comes from the
vehicle. The cannulas are placed either by surgeon from
the referring hospital or by a surgeon accompanying our
transport team. All 6 newborns with was transported on
this unit have survived and could later been discharged
and left the hospital.
Conclusions: Special equipment and specially trained
transport teams are necessary for transporting critically
ill children. Transport under ECMO is feasible but
remains a high-risk modality that should not replace the
prenatal and early postnatal transport to an ECMO
center. In some cases this can be a rescue therapy.

Corporeal Life Support Service, Royal Hospital for Sick
Children, Glasgow, UK
Background and Aims: ECLS is an established therapy
for neonates with a high-risk of death from respiratory
failure and is available in 4 UK centres. No standardised
criteria for initiating ECLS transfer exist although the
oxygenation index (OI) has been used historically. To
review factors influencing the decision to commence
ECLS for infants transferred to Glasgow as potential
candidates for ECLS.
Methods: A retrospective case note review
incorporating the West of Scotland Neonatal Transport
Database. Factors influencing ECLS requirement were
identified using bi-variate correlation. Binary logistic
regression was used to identify independent
determinants of ECLS requirement. SPSS® was used
for all analyses.
Results: Fifty-two infants were referred to the Glasgow
ECLS between March 2003 and March 2006, 49 of
whom were subsequently deemed suitable for transfer.
Thirty infants (61%) subsequently received ECLS.
ECLS requirement correlated strongly with oxygen
requirement (FiO2) (r=0.47, p=0.01), OI (r=0.41,
p=0.04), and mean airway pressure (MAP) (r=0.37,
p=0.08) at referral. It did not correlate with pO2 at
referral. Oxygen requirement and OI again correlated
with ECLS requirement at arrival at the ECLS centre.
Using binary logistic regression analysis, with referral
FiO2, MAP, and OI as covariates, FiO2 was a
significant independent predictor of ECLS requirement
(OR 1.18; 95% C.I. 1.04 - 1.33). MAP and OI were not
significant predictors in the model.
Conclusions: FiO2 is a better predictor of the
requirement for ECLS than OI at referral. Infants with a
high FiO2 who are suitable candidates for ECLS should
be discussed early with the ECLS centre to optimise
treatment options.
FULMINANT LIVER FAILURE IN INFANTS AND

Department of Pediatrics, Bicêtre Hospital, Le Kremlin-
Bicêtre, France
Background and Aims: To report a 20 years
experience of managing fulminant liver failure (FLF) in
infants and children.
Methods: Retrospective analysis from 1986 to 1996 and
prospectively maintained data base since 1996 was used
to identify infants and children admitted in a 22 beds
multidisciplinary ICU of a University Hospital, national
referral centre for pediatric liver disease.
Results: 200 patients were admitted for FLF with a
mean age of 4.0 ± 4.6 years-old, including 82 infants
(41%) of <1 year-old. A third of all FLF in infants
occurred within the last three years. In infants,
metabolic causes represented 43% of FLF cases
followed by viral FLF (21%). In children, viral (28%)
and non-A non-B-non-C FLF (26%) represented more
than half of the cases. Emergency liver transplantation
was performed in 44.9% of all patients (52% of children
and 33% of infants). Overall mortality was 41%,
reaching 52% in infants. 34% patients undergoing ELT
died. Death occurred within a mean time of 11±19.6
days after PICU admission. In 43 patients, ELT was
contra-indicated, all died. Survival in the 157 patients in
whom ELT was performed or was not indicated was
74%.
Conclusions: We report the largest pediatric series of
FLF and discuss epidemiology, outcome and
management.

BRAIN INJURY AND DYSFUNCTION DUE TO
METABOLIC DISEASES
F J Eyskens
Department of Metabolic Diseases, Queen Paola
Children's Hospital;Department of Paediatrics,
University Hospital of Antwerp, Laboratory for the
Study of Metabolic Diseases, Antwerp, Belgium
Background and Aims: Inborn errors of metabolism
are genetic disorders due to the deficiency of specific
enzymes and proteins involved in catabolic or anabolic
pathways, energy metabolism, transport/carriers, ion
channels, receptors and signalling. Most of these
diseases manifest during (early) childhood and affect the
nervous system more often than any other organ system.
Early diagnosis is important because treatment, if
available, may prevent acute metabolic attacks and
mental retardation, epilepsy, severe brain damage, or
death; and is also a prerequisite for optimal genetic
counselling. The ideal classification of metabolic
encephalopathies should be based on cause and
pathogenesis. In a recent paper (Ref.: A. Simons,
F. Eyskens et al. European Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry, 2006) we reported on the intelligence scores
and the psychiatric pathology of distinct groups of
children with metabolic diseases. Based on this study I
would divide the neurometabolic disorders roughly in
different subgroups: the “intoxication group1”(including
PKU, galactosemia, organic acidurias and urea cycle
disorders), the “substrate and enzymatic disorders of
energy metabolism group” (including glycogenoses,
neoglucogenesis and fatty acid oxidation disorders that
have hypoglycaemia in common), the “mitochondrial
respiratory chain defects group”, the “storage disorders
group” and the”deficiency disorders group”. This rough
classification based on pathophysiologic processes
provides insight in the different mechanisms giving rise
to metabolic encephalopathies.
Methods: The study population of the referred paper
consisted of 53 children between 0 and 18 years of age.
Diagnostic assessment included a semi-structured
interview, self-report questionnaires and a standard
intelligence test. Case reports of different metabolic
diseases not included in the paper will be discussed:
Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia, Canavan’s Disease,
peroxisomal disorders, lysosomal storage disorders,
Smith-Lemly-Opitz syndrome, Cerebrotendinous
Xanthomatosis, CDG syndrome, L-serine biosynthesis
defects, disorders of creatine metabolism, folate receptor
antibodies, pyridoxine dependency, and
neurotransmitter defects. Besides functional
disturbances, developmental structural brain defects,
neuronal and glial cell loss, demyelination /
leucodystrophy and stroke or stroke-like injury to the
brain are common in metabolic diseases. NMR imaging
of the brain can reveal specific abnormalities, e.g. Leigh
syndrome and Canavan’s disease, as well as aspecific
abnormalities, e.g. corpus callosum agenesia/ hypoplasia
and neuronal migratory disturbances. Special
extraneural abnormalities should be looked for:
dysmorphic features, cardiac involvement,
hepatosplenomegaly, skin disturbances,…
Results: In our study in 40% of the children older than 5
years, a child psychiatric diagnosis was made. While
CBCL total and internalizing scores did not differ
between metabolic disease groups, the CBCL
externalizing scores for some groups did (e.g. ADHD),
especially in the “intoxication group” with
phenylketonuria as the most prevalent disorder. Two
fifths of the children showed a below normal
intelligence, while a performal-verbal IQ discrepancy
was found in half of the children, especially in the
“intoxication group”. Of the school aged children almost
one third attended a special needs school.
Conclusions: Our results suggest substantial psychiatric
problems besides neurological disturbances in children
with a metabolic disease. Further study on larger groups
is warranted, which should enable further comparison of
patients affected by specific metabolic diseases
improving our insight in the pathogenesis of brain injury
and dysfunction.

Background and Aims: Intrauterine growth retardation
(IUGR) has been related to several health risks,
generally identified in small-for-gestational age (SGA)
individuals. We aimed to evaluate the impact of IUGR
on body composition and hormonal status in newborns
of small and appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA)
birthweight.
Methods: 4 monthly ultrasound examinations were
performed in 145 women at risk of IUGR. Intrauterine
growth slope (IUGS) was calculated as fetal weight
percentiles change and IUGR defined as its reduction by
more than 20 percentiles. SGA was defined as
birthweight below the 10th percentile. Newborns were
stratified into 4 groups: SGA-IUGR (n=27),
'constitutional' SGA (SGA-C, n=21), AGA-IUGR
(n=42) and 'constitutional' AGA (AGA-C, n=55). Cord
insulin and IGF-I concentrations were determined.
DEXA scan was performed at postnatal day 3.
Results: Fat mass percent were similar between SGA-
IUGR and SGA-C newborns (14.9±6.2 vs. 15.2±6.8%,
p=0.9), but significantly lower in AGA-IUGR vs. AGA-
C group (17.0±6.5 vs. 19.8±6.6%, p=0.01). Insulin
concentration was lowest in SGA-IUGR and highest in
AGA-C group, but the difference failed to reach
statistical significance. IGF-I levels were decreased in
SGA-IUGR vs. SGA-C and in AGA-IUGR vs. AGA-C
groups (28.5±16.5 vs. 43.9±26.8 ng/ml, p=0.009 and
52.8±29.8 vs. 65.4±26.3 ng/ml, p=0.02). In multivariate
analysis, birthweight was related to IUGS (r=0.6,
p<0.0001) and cord IGF-I (r=0.22, p=0.001), and
- 105 -
infant's adiposity to IUGS (r=0.45, p<0.0001), cord
insulin (r=0.23, p=0.02) and IGF-I concentrations
(r=0.2, p=0.04).
Conclusions: Fetal growth restriction affects body
composition and hormonal parameters even in newborns
of normal birthweight, suggesting these individuals
could be exposed to similar metabolic risks as SGA.

Background and Aims: The pathway linking
intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) with an
increased risk of type 2 diabetes is still not clear. We
hypothesised that maternal insulin sensitivity could be
related to fetal growth pattern.
Methods: Fetal growth was estimated by four monthly
ultrasound examinations from 22 to 36 gestational
weeks (GW) in 145 women with normal glucose
tolerance. IUGR was defined as a reduction in estimated
fetal weight by more than 20 percentiles. Small or
appropriate-for-gestational age (SGA/AGA) size was
defined as birthweight below/superior the 10th
percentile, respectively. At birth, infants were stratified
into 4 groups: SGA-IUGR (n=27), ‘constitutional’ SGA
(SGA-C, n=21), AGA-IUGR (n=42) and ‘constitutional’
AGA (AGA-C, n=55). Maternal fasting insulin and
glycaemia were determined at 22-24 GW. IGF-I and
insulin were measured in cord blood. DEXA scan in
newborns was performed at postnatal day 3.
Results: Maternal insulin resistance index (HOMA) at
22-24 GW was similar in SGA-IUGR and SGA-C
groups, but was significantly lower in AGA-IUGR vs.
AGA-C group. Maternal HOMA at 22-24 GW was
directly related to pre-pregnancy BMI (r=0.46,
p<0.0001), weight gain throughout pregnancy (r=0.2,
p=0.05), infants’ birthweight (r=0.2, p=0.05) and
percent of fat mass (r=0.3, p=0.016), cord insulin
(r=0.32, p=0.006) and IGF-I concentration (r=0.19,
p=0.06). In a multivariate analysis, birthweight was best
related to cord IGF-I concentration (r=0.46, p=0.0002),
gestational age (r=0.45, p<0.0001) and maternal HOMA
at 22-24 GW (r=0.23, p=0.01).
Conclusions: Maternal insulin resistance in mid-
pregnancy is directly related to fetal growth, infants’
birthweight and adiposity, probably reflecting a better
substrate delivery to fetus.

Background and Aims: Ghrelin stimulates GH release
and appetite, modulates carbohydrate metabolism and
insulin secretion and ultimately influences energy
balance and fat storage in the human body. The human
placenta expresses ghrelin at the mRNA level. It
remains unclear if the placenta releases ghrelin, a
possibly important growth factor for fetal growth into
the fetal or maternal circulation. Aim: Investigation of
placental ghrelin release into the fetal or maternal
circulation.
Methods: 14 placentas at term; dual in vitro placenta
perfusion for 6h for determination of ghrelin-, hCG- and
leptin- release; and glucose consumption, lactate
production, creatinine transfer (controls for normal
placental function). Ghrelin mRNA was measured by
quantitative PCR.
Results: Ghrelin was released into the maternal and into
the fetal circuit. The release rate into the maternal was
130 ± 100pg/g/h and into the fetal circuit 38 ± 36
pg/g/h. HCG release rates: maternal 62 ± 43 IU/g/min;
fetal 0.3 ± 0.2 IU/g/min; leptin release rates: maternal:
234 ± 92 ng/g/min; fetal 4 ± 2 ng/g/min. Normal ranges
for glucose consumption, lactate production and
creatinine transfer. In addition, ghrelin was clearly
expressed in placental homogenates at the mRNA level
(ghrelin/ß-actin mRNA: before perfusion 0.87±0.54,
after perfusion 1.29±0.33).
Conclusions: For the first time we could demonstrate
placental release of ghrelin. It was preferentially
released into the maternal circulation (70%), but it was
also released to a high amount (30%) into the fetal
circulation. Placental ghrelin is possibly involved in
growth and energy metabolism of the growing fetus in
concert with other placental hormones especially leptin
and resistin.

Background and Aims: Plasma L-arginine

who developed necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Term
infants who were homozygous (CC) for a C-to-A
nucleotide transversion (T1405N) in the gene-encoding
carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase I (CPSI) had lower L-
arginine concentrations than infants with the AA
genotype (Pearson et al., N Engl J Med 2001; 344:1832-

CPSI variants were determined in 16 preterm infants
with NEC (Bell stage II or greater, gestational age 30
wk), 29 preterm infants without NEC (gestational age
30 wk) and 25 healthy term infants. Results: Sepsis
was diagnosed more frequently in NEC infants (P=
0.031), whereas no significant differences in other
baseline characteristics and perinatal complications were
found between the two preterm populations. Prevalence
of the CC genotype was significantly higher in the NEC
population (CC:AC:AA = 81%:12.5%:6.5%) than in the
term control population (CC:AC:AA = 44%:48%:8%,
P=0.042) but no significant difference (P=0.10) was
found with the preterm control population (CC:AC:AA
= 52%:34%:14%). The NEC population did not conform
to Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for the CPS1 T1405N
polymorphism. Conclusions: Although they are limited
by the small sample size, our results suggest that the
T1405N variant of CPSI might be associated with the
risk of NEC in the preterm infant. Further study is
required to confirm these results in a larger cohort.

Background and Aims: Leptin regulates energy
balance and exerts an insulin sensitizing effect, while
adiponectin increases insulin action in muscle and liver
and exerts anti-atherogenic effects. This study
investigated the release of these two adipocytokines in
the blood of mothers (MP), and their single IUGR or
AGA fetuses (UC) and neonates on day 1 (N1) and 4
(N4) postnatally.
Methods: Plasma levels of adipocytokines were
measured by radioimmunoassays (LINCO Research,
USA) in 20 IUGR and 20 AGA mother-infant sets.
Results: Leptin levels were higher, while adiponectin
levels were lower in IUGR compared to AGA mothers
[32.5±3.7 vs 23.8±3.4microg/L and 5.4±0.9 vs
8.1±1.6mg/L respectively (p<0.01)]. These
adipocytokines are positively correlated only in AGA
mothers (r=0.512, p<0.02). In both groups, offspring’s
leptin levels decline significantly from UC to N1 and
stabilized up to N4, and this decline is more pronounced
in IUGR, while adiponectin levels demonstrated an
inverse profile.
Conclusions: The higher leptin levels in association
with lower adiponectin levels in IUGR vs AGA mothers
possibly reflect their state of inflammation and chronic
stress, which finally results to restricted fetal growth.
Moreover, the positive association between leptin and
adiponectin levels observed only in AGA mothers could
rather indicate that a compensatory mechanism is
functional in AGA mothers to counteract the
inflammatory state of parturition. This innovative
finding may serve to predict outcome in pregnancies at
risk. The pronounced leptin decline in IUGR from UC
to N1 may result from combination of intrauterine
stress, leading to higher fetal levels and decreased
adipose tissue, resulting to lower extrauterine levels.

Background and Aims: RANKL (receptor activator of
NF- B ligand) belongs to the tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) ligand family and is crucial for osteoclast
formation. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a member of the
TNF receptor superfamily inhibits osteoclastogenesis
and bone resorption. This study aimed to investigate
RANKL and OPG in full term intrauterine growth
restricted (IUGR-below the 10th customized centile)
and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) fetuses (UC)
and neonates on day 1 (N1) and 4 (N4) postpartum, as
well as in their mothers (MS) before delivery.
Methods: RANKL and OPG were measured by enzyme
immunoassays in the serum of 20 IUGR and 20 AGA
mother-infant sets.
Results: OPG levels were significantly higher in MS
than UC, N1 and N4 in both groups (in all cases p<0.01)
and RANKL levels were significantly higher in N4 than
MS, UC and N1 (in all cases p<0.02). In the AGA group
a negative correlation was documented between N1 and
N4 OPG levels and birthweight (r= -0.589, p=0.006 and
r=-0.530, p=0.016 respectively) as well as centiles
(r=-0.640, p=0.002, and r=-0.666, p=0.001
respectively). Furthermore, a negative correlation
between MS RANKL and MS OPG was found (r=-
0.484, p=0.03) in the AGA group.
Conclusions: In conclusion, maternal OPG levels are
increased before delivery, possibly due to placental
production. Increased N4 RANKL levels could be
attributed to postnatal bone remodeling. The negative
association of OPG with birthweight and centile could
imply its protective role to diminished bone
mineralization. Lastly, the negative correlation of MS
RANKL to MS OPG reinforces their role in bone
homeostasis.

Background and Aims: The aim was to investigate
urinary excretion rates of glucocorticoid metabolites
(GM) in well and ill preterm infants (PI) > 30 wks.
Methods: Illness severity was measured by the score for
neonatal acute physiology (SNAP). GM were profiled
by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in 24-h
urinary samples. Excretion rates of GM were summed to
calculate cortisol production rates (CPR) in 61 well
(mean±SD: 33.6±1.7wks) and 20 ill (33.2±1.6wks) PI.
Results: During the 1st week of life, SNAP were
significantly higher in the group of ill PI (p<0.01)
compared to well PI except day 2 (p=0.06). Medians of
CPR (μg/kg/d per mg creatinine) in ill (well) PI were at
1st day: 31 (28); 2nd day: 24 (28), 3rd day: 27 (26); 5th
day: 28 (17); 2nd week: 20 (19); 3rd week: 17 (19); 4th
week: 16 (16) and 2nd month: 17 (23). There was a
significant correlation between the maximum of SNAP
and the maximum of CPR (OR 3.7, 95%CI 1.2-11.5);
p=0.02) in a regression model which comprised
gestational age (p=0.004), mode of delivery (NS),
gender (NS) and the administration of prenatal steroids
(NS) as co-variables. The CPR of PI > 30 wks were
1.5-3 times lower compared to PI < 30 wks (J Clin
Endocrinol Metab 2005;90:5737).
Conclusions: In contrast to PI < 30 wks, there was a
positive correlation between severity of illness and CPR
in PI > 30 wks, indicating a maturation of the adrenal
stress response. This maturation was concurrently
associated with significantly lower CPR compared to PI
< 30 wks.

Background and Aims: Major changes in bone mineral
density (BMD) occur during puberty. Few studies have
shown no impairment in BMD during GnRH agonist
therapy in girls with precocious (PP) and early puberty
(EP) using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA).
Quantitative Ultra Sound (QUS) technology, which
evaluates bone strength (BS), has not been studied in
this group yet. Our objective was to evaluate BMD, BS
and bone metabolism in girls with PP/EP during
treatment with GnRH agonist.
Methods: We evaluated 25 girls: 10 with PP (age<8)
and 15 with EP (8<age<9). BMD was measured by both
DXA (Hologic QDR 4500) and QUS (Omnisense
7000P) at baseline, after 6 and 12 months from onset of
therapy. Biochemical markers of bone turnover-serum
Bone Specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BSALP) and
urinary Deoxypyridinoline\Creatinine (DPD\CR) were
also measured.
Results: Mean lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck
(FN) BMD measured by DXA were significantly low at
baseline (LS: p<0.0001, FN: p<0.002). BS measured by
QUS was significantly lower at the radius (p<0.001) but
normal at the tibia. There was no significant change in
BMD and BS throughout the first year of therapy.
Serum BSALP measurements were appropriate for age
and pubertal stage at baseline. Urinary DPD\CR
measurements were significantly high (p< 0.001) at
baseline. Both metabolic parameters did not differ
significantly during the first year of therapy.
Conclusions: Girls with central PP and EP have low
BMD and BS for chronological age and increased bone
resorption markers. These parameters do not change
significantly during the first year of therapy with GnRH
agonist.

Background and Aims: Good knowledge on
susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori (HP) isolates to
antibiotics of choix allows improving HP eradication
rate in the treatment. The present study was to assess
resistance rate to metronidazole (Metro), clarithromycin
(Clar) và amoxicillin (Amox) of HP isolates from
children, according to sex, age group and period of time.
Methods: Retrospective study investigated resistance
rate and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of HP
isolates from 282 children under 18 years during a
period from 1993 to 2002 to Metro using agar disk
diffusion method, to Clar and Amox using E-test.
Results: Resistance rate of HP isolates was 37,5% to
Metro, 25,8% to Clar and 7,3% to both. No isolate
- 108 -
resistant to Amox was identified. The rate of resistance
to Metro was 52,3% in isolates from children above 10
years old and 30,5% in those from younger (p<0,03),
and 50,8% from those isolated between 1993 and 1995,
37,9% in those from 1996 and 1999 and 21,9% in those
from 2000 and 2002 (p<0,004). MICs in Metro resistant
isolated in 2000-2002 isolates were significantly higher
than those in 1996-1999 (p<0,005) and those in
1993-1995 (p<0,0001). MICs in Clar resistant isolates in
2000-2002 were significantly lower than those in 1996-
1999 (p<0,01). MICs in isolates dually resistant to
Metro and Clar were significantly higher than those in
single resistant ones (p <0,01) and p<0,005,
respectively).
Conclusions: There was a high rate of HP isolates
resistant to Metro and Clar in children, according to sex,
age group and time while no isolate resistant to Amox
was found.

Background and Aims: Knowing the epidemiology of
invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children is
important, mainly when the introduction of
antipneumococcal vaccine in inmunization schedules is
considered.
Methods: Clinical records of all children under 14 years
of age, with confirmed IPD from 1989 to 2005 were
reviewed. Main clinical and laboratory data, serogroups,
and antimicrobial resistance pattern were analyzed.
Serotyping was performed at the National Microbiology
Center (Madrid). Rates of IPD were calculated.
Results: There were 83 cases of IPD, and 48% of the
cases occurred in children under 2 years old. Rates of
IPD rose from 7.8 to 30.0 cases per 100,000 children in
the 1989-1991 and 2003-2005 periods, respectively
(p< 0.05). Underlying disease was present in 13% of
patients and two patients died. Main sites of infection
were: bacteraemia/sepsis (80.2%), with associated
pneumonia in 34.5% of them; and meningitis (16.1%).
Serum levels of CRP and procalcitonine were elevated
in 83.3% and 55.6% of test performed, respectively.
Throughout the study, resistance to penicillin declined
from 40% to 14.3% (p< 0.036), while resistance to
erythromycin and cefotaxime has not changed. The most
frequent serogroups were 19, 23, 14 and 6, and overall
62.4% are included in heptavalent vaccine. In the last 4
years, serotypes more frequently isolated were 19A,
18C, 6A and 19F.
Conclusions: This study shows that rates of IPD in
children have increased in the last 16 years in our
hospital. The most prevalent serogroups isolated are
included in the heptavalent vaccine, but serotypes 19A
and 6A also have increased in the last 4 years.

Background and Aims: Adequate hand hygiene is
widely accepted as the cornerstone in nosocomial
infection control. The overall compliance with hand
hygiene is considered to be poor in different studies and
difficult to enhance. A multifaceted campaign showed to
be the best way to improve the behavior towards hand
hygiene. We evaluated the effectiveness of an education
program on compliance with hand hygiene in a neonatal
intensive care unit (NICU).
Methods: The study was performed on the NICU (level
IV) of Erasmus MC – Sophia Children’s Hospital. The
education program (intervention) was based on Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, the
observed practice prior to the intervention and the
Theory of Planned Behavior (attitude, subjective norms,
perceived behavior control). An interrupted time series
study was performed by guided observations of hygienic
behavior of health care workers. The mean dry time
after disinfection and the amount of used hand alcohol
were measured. Two pre-intervention observations took
place in the period January 2005 – May 2005 and the
first post-intervention observations took place in the
period December 2005 - March 2006.
Results: The results of the first (n = 222) and second
(n=378) pre-intervention observations and one post-
intervention measurement (n=241) showed respectively
a median (SD) dry time of 5 (±7), 7 (±9) and 12 (±8)
seconds (P < .05). The amount of used hand alcohol for
each unit increased from 51.9-55.3 ml/ bed to 65.4
ml/bed after intervention.
Conclusions: The multifaceted education program seem
to improve hand hygiene.

PICU, St Mary's Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: To determine the incidence
and risk factors for invasive fungal infection in our
Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).
Methods: Case records of patients admitted from
August 2002 to August 2005 were reviewed. Data
collected included underlying medical condition, site of
infection, associated bacterial and viral infections,
antimicrobial and antifungal treatment and mortality.
Results: 1300 patients were admitted to PICU in the
study period. 176 of these stayed for >5 days. Of these
176, 29 (16%) developed fungal infection, 28 with
candida and 1 with aspergillus flavus. 3 (10%) of these
had an underlying immune deficiency. Candida species
cultured were albicans (23), tropicalis (3), parapsilosis
- 109 -
(1) and krusei (1). Fungi were cultured from blood (5),
urine (10), endotracheal secretions (9) or in catheters in
sterile sites (9), either alone or in combination. 26 (90%)
were on antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired infection
but only 1 (3%) was on fluconazole prophylaxis. 1 (3%)
of patients with fungal infection died. In the remaining
147 patients, 115 (66%) were on antibiotics to cover
hospital-acquired infection and 12 (8%) patients were
receiving fluconazole prophylaxis. There was no
significant difference in the proportion of patients on
nosocomial antibiotic cover or on fluconazole
prophylaxis between the two groups (p=ns, Fisher’s
exact test).
Conclusions: All patients with invasive fungal infection
required a prolonged stay of >5 days on PICU. Almost
all were on treatment with antibiotics to cover hospital-
acquired infection at the time of diagnosis. Further work
is required to elucidate the role of prophylactic
fluconazole in PICU.
PREDICTING SEVERE BACTERIAL INFECTION
IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN WITH FEVER
WITHOUT A SOURCE

Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova, Italy
Background and Aims: Fever without a source (FWS)
is a common reason for children to visit the Pediatric
Emergency Department (PED) and it remains a
challenge for the clinician to early detect severe
bacterial infections (SBI). Our aims were to assess the
incidence of SBI in an unselected population of children
< 36 months attending our PED and to compare the
performance of different biological markers in detecting
these infections.
Methods: Over a 12 months period all children aged 7
days - 36 months admitted for FWS were prospectively
included. Patients underwent diagnostic tests according
to the guidelines in use. Clinical and laboratory
parameters - C-Reactive Protein (CRP), White Blood
Cell (WBC) count, Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) -
were collected and compared in relationship to
microbiological results. Specificity, sensitivity,
multilevel likelihood ratios and ROC curve analysis
were calculated.
Results: 385 patients were included; 75 (19.5%) had the
final diagnosis of SBI, mostly represented by acute
pyelonephritis. No difference was found in the clinical
parameters between children with and without a SBI. Of
the laboratory parameters CRP obtained the best
sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood
ratio values. Area under ROC curve was 0.881 (IC 95%
0.824 – 0.925) for CRP, 0.779 (IC 95% 0.710 – 0.838)
for WBC count, and 0.782 (IC 95% 0.713 – 0.841) for
ANC.
Conclusions: The risk of SBI is still high in this post-
HIB vaccine era. CRP is superior to clinical parameters
and to other more conventional marker in predicting
which children have a SBI and need prompt antibiotic
treatment.

Background and Aims: More than 60% of VAP
episodes are related to aerobic gram negative bacteria,
predominantly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Acinetobacter spp. The pathogenesis of VAP can be
related to bacteria translocation from oropharynx to
tracheobronchial tree. The aim of the study was to
describe characteristics of gram negative pathogens
colonization of children's oropharyngeal secretion,
through different oral care methods.
Methods: Prospective randomized controlled study
realized in a University Hospital PICU in the city of S?o
Paulo, Brazil. The study was approved by the ethics
research committee. The sample was composed of 56
children, 29 (51.8%) in Control Group-CG (non-
pharmacological intervention) and 27 (48.2%) in
Experimental Group-EG (0.12% chlorhexidine).
Microbiological cultures of oropharyngeal were
obtained 24, 48 and 96 hours after admission and
analyzed according to bacterial identification data and
antimicrobial resistance.
Results: The majority of the sample was composed of
children in preschool age (4.5±4.7), males (62.5%),
white (67.8%), eutrophic (50.0%), with surgical
diagnosis (55.3%) and emergency admissions (51.8%).
Gram negative were isolated in 39 (50%) of 78 CG
cultures and in 43 (60.6%) of the 71 in EG; 28 (30.8%)
in CG were pathogens and 26 (35.2%) in EG. In CG
42.8% and EG 50.0% of pathogens presented antibiotic
resistance to more than 14 groups of antibiotics. The
main pathogens (CG;EG) identified were Acinetobacter
baumanii (28.0%;3.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosas
(24.0%;19.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (20.0%; 32.0%)
and Enterobacter spp (12.0%;29.0%). Conclusions: The
use of 0.12% chlorexidine don't reduce the number of
cultures with gram negative pathogens in the EG.
Pathogens frequency was different between the studied
groups. Acknowledgments: Dr. Pedreira acknowledges

Background and Aims: Purpose of the work was to
study prevalence of allergic rhinitis and clinical-allergic
peculiarities of allergic rhinitis together with bronchial
asthma in population of school-age children in Tbilisi.
- 110 -
Methods: The researches were conducted based on
questioning of random and representative groups of
school-age children, by the cross-section method of
epidemiologic research. At the first stage of research
work, there were questioned 3000 children from 6 to 17;
at the second stage clinical-allergological researches
were conducted with 256 randomly selected children
with the signs of rhinitis.
Results: According to the obtained results, prevalence
of allergic rhinitis was 13.2%. In 19.1% of cases,
allergic rhinitis was accompanied with bronchial asthma
and in 8% of the patients there was indicated bronchial
spasm of physical load (verified as clinically, also
through the test with physical load), coughing version of
asthma was observed in 4.5% of children. Rhinitis
among Tbilisi children population was 13.2%. There is
revealed high frequency (p<0.001) of late diagnostics
and prevalence of light and medium intermitting forms
of allergic rhinitis.
Conclusions: Combination of inherited predisposition
to allergy with the atopic dermatitis, in the in the
anamnesis of children with the increased level of
general IgE in the blood serum may be considered as
early diagnostic predictor of atopic phenotype as for the
allergic rhinitis, also for its combination with the
bronchial asthma.

Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Ventilated, critically ill
children commonly receive sedative and analgesic drugs
to ease their mental burden, anxiety and pain, induced
by frightening or painful interventions and
environmental factors in the pediatric intensive care unit
(PICU). Intravenous opioids (such as morphine and
fentanyl) and benzodiazepines (such as midazolam) are
the most used drugs for this purpose. Abrupt
discontinuation or rapid tapering off after long-term
administration may lead to problems of tolerance,
physiological or psychological dependence and
withdrawal symptoms. The aim of this study was to
describe the frequency of withdrawal symptoms and the
correlation between total doses of benzodiazepine or
opioids and withdrawal symptoms.
Methods: This prospective study was performed in
children admitted to the PICU of the Erasmus MC –
Sophia Children’s Hospital, Rotterdam, The
Netherlands. Patients were included if midazolam and/or
opioids were administrated for more than 5 days.
Withdrawal symptoms were assessed using the Sophia
Benzodiazepine & Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SBOWS),
which includes all withdrawal symptoms described in
the pediatric literature. Withdrawal symptoms were
observed by the caregiving nurse.
Results: 2188 observation in 79 children were recorded.
Forty-two percent were performed within 24h after
decreasing or discontinuation of medication (decrease
group). Symptoms representing overstimulation of the
Central Nervous System such as anxiety, agitation,
grimacing, sleep disturbance, increased muscle tension
and movement disorder were observed in more than
10% of the observations. In the category
gastrointestinal-dysfunction diarrhea and gastric
retention were mostly observed (respectively 14.5% and
13.0%). Tachypnea, fever, sweating and hypertension
were observed in more than 13% of the observations as
manifestation of autonomic dysfunction. There are
hardly any differences detected in the frequency of the
24 withdrawal symptoms between total dataset and the
decrease group. The Spearman Rank Correlation
coefficient (rs) for the relation between total doses of
midazolam and maximum sum score (of the SBOWS)
was 0.51 (p<0.001). The correlation between total doses
of opioids and the maximum sum score was an rs of
0.39 (p=0.001). The correlation between duration of
administered medication and maximum sum score was
an rs of 0.52 (p<0.001).
Conclusions: This study gives a complete overview of
the frequency of the 24 withdrawal symptoms in
children after decrease and/or discontinuation of
benzodiazepines and/or opioids. There is insufficient
evidence to state that withdrawal symptoms with a
frequency < 10% can be included in a clinical
withdrawal scale. Duration and high doses of
benzodiazepines and/or opioids are risk factors for
development of withdrawal symptoms in children. The
SBOWS should be the basis for further development of
a withdrawal assessment tool. Further prospective
research of symptoms with low frequency of occurrence
and coherence as well as research into the
interdependency of symptoms is recommended.
HOW RELIABLE DO WE ASSESS PAIN IN THE
LONG RUN?

Pediatric Surgical Intensive Care Unit, Erasmus MC-
Sophia's Children Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: In 1999 our Pediatric Surgical
Intensive Care Unit implemented the COMFORT
behavior scale in daily practice combined with a
treatment algorithm. All nurses were trained in pain
assessment and each had to perform ten assessments
with a trained nurse to determine interrater reliability
using the linearly weighted Cohen’s Kappa. Since than
pain assessment became standard of care with. In 2004
and 2005 14787 combined COMFORT behavior and
Visual Analogue Scale pain scores were assessed in 612
patients. Although from the outside this seemed
satisfactory we questioned the (interrater) reliability of
scoring by the nurses. This study aimed to determine
current interrater reliability.
Methods: Nurses assessed COMFORT behavior and a
Numeric Rating for pain and distress at bedside.
Linearly weighted Cohen’s Kappa was calculated and
compared with the previous one in eight nurses. In
addition the Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for
COMFORT total score and NRS pain and distress was
calculated.
- 111 -
Results: Eight nurses assessed 78 paired scores in ten
infants. Interrater reliability ranged from 0.21 to 0.64
and was poor to moderate. The ICC for COMFORT
total score was 0.60, for NRS pain 0.55 and for NRS
distress 0.46. Analysis on item level showed large
discrepancy in scoring for muscle tone (kappa 0.13) and
facial tension (kappa 0.23) and acceptable kappa’s for
crying (0.73) or respiratory response (0.67).
Conclusions: Despite satisfactory frequency of pain
assessment, interrater reliability between experienced
nurses on our PSICU was poor. In future clear
instruction is required to maintain an acceptable level of
scoring.

Medicine, University of Siena, Italy
Background and Aims: We know the importance of
parents' collaboration in helping children to cope with
pain by their presence and distraction. We recently
successfully used this approach in neonatal analgesia.
We also know the capturing power of television on
children. The difference between these two approaches
is that the former is active and involves affectivity,
though fear may be transmitted to the child, whereas the
latter is passive. Our aim was to assess the analgesic
effect of active and passive distraction (parent and
television) during venipuncture.
Methods: We studied 69 children aged 7-12 years
undergoing venipuncture. The children were randomly
divided into three groups: a control group (C) without
any distraction procedure, a group TV in which passive
distraction was used, using a TV cartoon, and a group M
in which mothers performed active distraction. Both
mothers and children scored pain after the procedure.
Results: Main pain levels rated by the children were
23.04 (SD= 24.57), 17.39 (SD= 21.36) and 8.91 (SD=
8.65) for C, M, and TV groups respectively. Main pain
levels rated by mothers were 21.30 (SD= 19.9), 23.04
(SD= 18.39) and 12.17 (SD= 12.14) for C, M, and TV
groups respectively. Scores assigned by mothers and
children indicated that procedures performed during TV
watching were less painful (p<0.05) than control and
procedures performed during active distraction.
Conclusions: TV watching was more effective than
active distraction. This was due the emotional
participation of mothers in the active procedure, or of
the distracting power of television.

Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Princess
Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Australia
Background and Aims: The Bispectral index (BIS) is a
processed EEG parameter that indicates the hypnotic
effects of anaesthetic and sedative agents on the brain.
BIS may be useful in achieving optimal level of sedation
and preventing oversedation in the paediatric intensive
care unit (PICU) patient. The objectives of this study
were to evaluate the clinical utility of the Bispectral
index (BIS) monitoring in titrating sedative agents when
compared with Standard Practice (SP) and to determine
the correlation of the BIS and the level of sedation,
using the Modified Motor Activity Assessment Scale
(MMAAS).
Methods: This single blind randomised controlled study
was conducted in the paediatric intensive care unit of a
tertiary referral hospital in Western Australia. Following
parental consent, ventilated children requiring sedation
were randomly assigned to the BIS-guided sedation
group or the control group (standard practice).
Results: Data from 75 children provided 1168 valid
paired observations. The median age was 16.6 months,
ranging between 0.9 and 208.7 months. Preliminary
results indicated a 10% increase of midazolam (0.09 and
0.1 mg/Kg/h) and opioids (48 and 53 mcg/Kg/h) in the
BIS group. The median correlation coefficient between
MMAAS and BIS was 0.25 (range -0.78 and 0.87) in the
control group.
Conclusions: BIS-guided sedation does not seem to
help reducing the amount of midazolam in sedated
children when compared to the MMAAS. However,
these results are preliminary and should be interpreted
with caution. Further investigation is required to
determine the specific situations in which the BIS could
be useful in the management of sedation in the PICU.

Background and Aims: Sleep is of great importance to
hospitalized patients. Sleep facilitates recovery. PICU's
are characterized by intense activity day and night; the
work of the nursing staff involves noise and requires
light, which may result in sleep disturbances. The
purpose of this study was to evaluate sleep disturbances
in the PICU. Methods: Sleep patterns of 30 children
were monitored by Actigraphy and Manual sound level
meter from 7pm till 7am the next morning. Factors may
interrupt sleep were monitored. Results: Thirty children
(19M/11F) were observed. All were fully conscious, not
treated by any hypnotics or sedatives and no history of
sleep disorders. Their mean age was 6±4 years. Average
total sleep time was 4±2 hours, with a sleep efficiency
of 40±21%. A significant negative correlation existed
between sleep efficiency and the nursing staff activity
level (r= -0.53, p<0.05), total general activities
(r= -0.51, p<0.05), light above the patient (r= -0.73,
p<0.001), the instrumentation level (r= -0.56, p<0.001)
and the average noise level (r= -0.74, p<0.001).
- 112 -
Similarly, total sleep time correlated negatively with
these factors (r= -0.49, -0.39, -0.48 and -0.62, p<0.05
for all. Conclusions: Childrens' sleep pattern in the
PICU is severely disturbed. Nursing staff is unaware of
the importance of efficient sleep, which facilitates
recovery. Future studies should focus on the outcome
effects of modifying these preventable adverse factors.
Most of the disturbances are preventable during night.
HALLUCINATORY EXPERIENCES REPORTED

PICU, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: Our aim was to establish, by
direct interview, the extent and nature of children’s
hallucinations following a paediatric intensive care
(PIC) admission. We hypothesized that the association
between delusional memories and posttraumatic stress
reported in adult intensive care survivors would also
apply to children.
Methods: The setting was a 20 bed general PIC unit in a
tertiary referral Children’s Hospital. Children (n=102),
aged 7 – 17y, were interviewed 3 months after discharge
using the ICU Memory Tool (Jones et al 2000) and the
CRIES PTSD scale (Perrin et al 2005).
Results: Thirty-three children (32%) reported at least
one delusional memory. Of these 25 reported having
hallucinations and 8 vivid or bizarre dreams. There was
a significant association between prevalence of
hallucinations and length of time on morphine: 0/10
(0%) in the no morphine group, 7/45 (16%) in morphine
for <2days and 17/47 (36%) in the morphine >2 days
group ( 2 =8.84, p = 0.012). The association with
midazolam was not significant ( 2 = 2.60, p = 0.279).
Posttraumatic stress scores at 3 months were
significantly associated with the presence of
hallucinations (p = 0.002) and with emergency
admission (p = 0.002). Extent of factual memory of
admission was not related to subsequent posttraumatic
stress.
Conclusions: These results highlight the importance of
direct interviews with children in ascertaining the
presence of hallucinations after a PIC admission. We
propose that improved management of these distressing
symptoms in children may lead to a reduction in short
term distress and better longer-term psychological
adjustment.
THERAPY OF PERSISTENT DUCTUS
ARTERIOSUS IN PRETERM INFANTS - WHY,
WHEN AND HOW?
A H G Von Der Wense
Department of Neonatology and Paediatric Intensive
Care, Altonaer Kinderkrankenhaus, Hamburg, Germany
Background and Aims: Patency of the ductus
arteriosus (PDA) is one of the most frequent problems
complicating the clinical course of very low and
especially extreme low birth weight infants (VLBW,
ELBW). Thus a large number of preventive,
prophylactic or therapeutic strategies have been
developed over the last 30 years to minimize the
incidence of PDA and its potentially harmful
consequences. Recent clinical trials and metaanalyses
will be discussed concerning efficacy in closure of PDA
as well as side effects of pharmacological treatment and
longterm outcome variables.
Methods: Literature Review and Prospective Cohort
Study in the Hamburg Ibuprofen Trial.
Results: Ibuprofen (IBU) and Indomethacin (INDO)
have been intensively studied for pharmacological
closure of PDA. Metaanalyses and several trials have
shown comparable efficacy for inducing closure of PDA
in VLBW-Infants. Closure rates between 60 and 90%
for VLBW infants and around 40-60% for ELBW
infants have been reported for early treatment of PDA.
Acute side effects are favouring IBU, because it has less
vasoconstricive potential especially for renal perfusion.
The occurence of oliguria is significantly lower for IBU
compared to INDO. Furthermore less influence on
cerebral perfusion has been shown for IBU, thus
avoiding cerebral vasoconstriction. Mesenteric blood
flow is significantly lower after treatment with INDO.
Two studies have raised concern about a higher rate of
chronic lung disease (defined as the need for oxygen
therapy at 28 days) for the IBU group. However these
findings have not been reported by other groups, and
pulmonary outcome at 36 weeks of gestation was not
investigated, although this is far more clinically
relevant. Optimal timing of treatment still remains
controversial. INDO has been shown to reduce the
incidence of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH),
when used prophylactically during the first days of life.
The rate of PDA and surgical intervention was also
significantly lower. However long term outcome has
been disappointing for the treatment group, showing no
reduction of developmental deficit or infantile cerebral
palsy. IBU as well has been investigated for
prophylactic treatment. Incidence of PDA and surgical
closure was also significantly reduced. There was no
clear effect on IVH. One trial was stopped after
occurrence of severe pulmonary hypertension in three
patients. At the moment prophylactic use of INDO is
questionable and of IBU is not recommended. Number
needed to treat (NNT) for reduction of PDA surgery is
20 and for reduction of severe IVH 25, showing a high
proportion of 'overtreated infants' in the prophylactic
regimen.
Conclusions: IBU and INDO are both equally effective
in pharmacological closure of PDA. IBU has
significantly less acute side effects when used in an
'early therapeutic strategy' e.g. from day 3 of life.
- 113 -
Cerebral perfusion is not altered. Prophylactic use of
both drugs is potentially harmful, especially for infants
at low risk for development of hemodynamic relevant
PDA. Pulmonary hypertension should be excluded prior
to treatment with cyclooxigenase inhibitors. Our own
treatment strategy derived from the Hamburg Ibuprofen
study is presented.
IBUPROFEN TREATMENT OF PATENT
DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS IN PRETERM INFANT,
EXPERIENCE FROM STOCKHOLM
S Johansson
Department of Woman and Child Health, Karolinska
Institutet, Stockhom, Sweden
Background and Aims: Ibuprofen treatment of patent
ductus arteriosus (PDA) was introduced at the
Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden in
2001. During the years 2001 to 2004 clinical data was
prospectively collected on all infant treated with
ibuprofen, to assess renal function and clinical outcome.
Methods: 83 infants (mean gestational age 27 weeks,
standard deviation 2 weeks) with echocardiographic
PDA-diagnosis received 98 courses of ibuprofen
(10+5+5 mg/kg). Renal function and water balance were
measured by urinary output and s-creatinine, s-urea and
s-sodium. Short term closure was assessed by
echocardiography 18-24 hours after completed
ibuprofen course. Surgical closure rate was assessed at
discharge. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was
defined as need of supplementary oxygen at 36
postconceptional age.
Results: There was a transient reduction in renal
function after the first and second dose of ibuprofen.
After the third dose, renal function was not different
from pre-treatment values. Short term closure was
achieved in most infants, but the rate was lowest (71%)
among 23-24 week infants. Relapses were also common
in this group, due to septicemias. Final non-surgical
closure rate ranged from 57% among 23-24 week
infants to 94% among infants born 29 weeks.
Accordingly, surgical closure rates varied between 43%
to 6%. The BPD rate was 44% in this cohort.
Conclusions: Ibuprofen PDA-treatment was associated
with a transient renal dysfunction. The decrease in renal
function was small but surveillance of renal function is
indicated during ibuprofen treatment. Short term PDA
closure with ibuprofen was achieved in most infants, but
final non-surgical closure rate was low among infants
born at 23-24 weeks. Whether optimized ibuprofen
treatment strategies, such as earlier initation of
treatment, could decrease surgical closure rate among
the most immature infants remains to be determined.
The BPD rate of 44% was comparable to the rate among
indomethacin treated infants in 1997-1999 (45%).
IBUPROFEN, BILIRUBIN AND ALBUMIN: THE
IMPORTANCE OF A BALANCE
B Van Overmeire
Neonatology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Antwerp
University Hospital, Belgium
Ibuprofen at a dosing scheme of 10-5-5 mg/kg at 24 hour
intervals is increasingly used as an alternative to
indomethacin for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus
in premature infants. Because ibuprofen is highly bound
to albumin it may interfere with bilirubin-albumin binding
and increase the free fraction of bilirubin, augmenting the
risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity.
A large interindividual variation in ibuprofen
pharmacokinetics has been demonstrated in newborns.
One hour after the first dose, ibuprofen plasma levels are
reported to vary from 31 to 280 mg/L. Ibuprofen is
mainly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 complex and
more specifically by the CYP2C8 and CYP2C9
subfamily. Maturation of CYP2C increases fast after
birth, reaching 30% of adult activity by one month of age.
Ibuprofen clearance is highly variable among individual
neonates and increases with advancing postnatal age.
Ibuprofen serum half-lives decreased from 43 hours at age
3 days to 27 hours at age 5 days. Additionally, the
pharmacokinetics may also be influenced by the presence
of a ductal shunt. The volume of distribution changed
more pronounced in infants with a closing ductus.
Ibuprofen is 95% bound to albumin and may interfere
with bilirubin-albumin binding, thereby increasing the
free fraction of bilirubin and induce a higher risk of
bilirubin encephalopathy. High ibuprofen serum levels
have been shown to have comparable displacing effects
on free bilirubin as sulfizoxazole, a drug that has caused
bilirubin encephalopathy in neonatal infants. Free
bilirubin is superior to total bilirubin concentration in
predicting the risk for bilirubin toxicity. The risk of
inducing kernicterus depends on the concentration of
ibuprofen, the binding constants of albumin for ibuprofen
and bilirubin, and the bilirubin load at the moment when
ibuprofen is administered. Albumin-ibuprofen binding is
variable between neonates and probably also changes in
time. On the first day after birth the biliubin pool is
usually low, but increases steadily in the first week of life.
In many neonatal intensive care units patent ductus
arteriosus is preferentially treated when first signs of left
to right ductal shunt develop, typically at the moment
when the bilirubin pool is increased.
Several methods for the measurement of free bilirubin, or
indirectly by the assessment of albumin binding, were
developed. Recently an improved peroxidase assay has
been developed with minimal serum dilution and two
enzyme concentrations, yielding more accurate results.
In order to better understand the interactions between
ibuprofen, albumin and bilirubin, the concentration of
these molecules were analysed in plasma simultaneously
with free bilirubin levels, before and after the
administration of successive doses of ibuprofen in
neonates of varying gestational and postnatal age with
patent ductus arteriosus. The infants were followed-up
after discharge and were screened for possible hearing
deficits. No significant changes of free bilirubin
concentrations were observed after the administration of
ibuprofen. There was no correlation between these
changes and the increase of ibuprofen levels. Free
bilirubin increased inversely proportional to birth weight.
No clinical signs of bilirubin neurotoxicity could be
detected in surviving infants.
First results seem to demonstrate that the risk of bilirubin
encephalopathy is not increased after treatment with
ibuprofen at a dosing scheme of 10-5-5 mg/kg, with peak
- 114 -
levels below 60 mg/L and total bilirubin concentrations
below 10mg/dL. However, when higher doses are applied
in sick infants, the risk of kernicterus may markedly
increase.

Background and Aims: Probiotics may have
immunomodulatory functions, exerting beneficial
effects in allergic disease. We investigated whether
prolonged daily consumption of Lactobacillus casei DN-
114 001 fermented milk improve clinical and
immunological condition of children aged 3-6 years
allergic to inhalants.
Methods: In a randomised-controlled multicentric trial
patients were randomly assigned to receive for one year
100 ml per day of L. casei DN-114 001 fermented milk
(109 cells/ml), or no probiotics (controls). Clinical
evaluations occurred every 3 months. Faecal flora
composition was assessed every 6 months (30 treated,
15 controls). Outcome measures were allergy-related
signs incidence, infections incidence/severity, IgE-G-A
serological levels (baseline vs 12 months).
Results: Participants (187; 92 treated) were similar
regarding gestational age, breastfeeding, family
smokers, pets, siblings, day-care admission.
Supplemented children exibited less rhinitis episodes
than controls up to T6 [mean-SD: 0,6 (1) vs 0,9 (1,1) at
T3, p= 0,031; 1 (2,6) vs 1,6 (2) at T6, p=0,027]. Asthma
and infections incidence/severity did not differ between
groups. IgE mean % variation increased in controls at
T12 vs baseline (+ 25%; p< 0,01) but not in the treated
group (+8%; p=0,59). IgG and IgA mean % variation
significantly increased in treated group (+6,3% and
+11,5% respectively; p< 0,01) but not in controls (2,4%
and 3,7% respectively; p=0,34 and 0,19). Faecal
analysis showed Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 in the
gut flora of 78% of supplemented children through the
study period.
Conclusions: Long-term daily consumption of
Lactobacillus Casei DN-114 001 fermented milk may
positively influence on the clinical and immunological
status of allergic children.

Background and Aims: The supply of LC-PUFAs to
the foetus and infant is associated with growth. Our aim
was to study the growth of children whose mothers had
received a vitamin-mineral-supplement during
pregnancy and lactation with additional
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) compared to those without
DHA-supplement.
Methods: At 22 weeks of gestation 144 mothers were
enrolled to a randomised controlled double blind clinical
trial on the effects of a daily intake of a vitamin-mineral
supplement up to 37 weeks and voluntarily up to 3
months of lactation. 0.2 g DHA was added to one
supplement (DHA-group). Of the 116 term newborns,
measured at ages 1 and 3 months, finally 69 children (no
significant selection bias) were followed up to 21
months. For statistical analysis of their growth (length,
weight, BMI, head circumference) linear mixed models
were used.
Results: At birth, anthropometric values were nearly
identical in both groups. But a significant time
dependent effect was observed for the DHA-group in
weight (p=0.049) and BMI (p=0.044), when taking into
account sex, gestational and chronological age of the
infant, the mother’s education, parity, BMI, gestational
weight gain and breast-feeding. After controlling for all
influential variables, in 21 months old infants of the
DHA-group, weight was significantly lower by -0.6 kg
(p=0.006), and BMI by -0.77 kg/m2 (p=0.031), while
head circumference was slightly larger and length was
similar in both groups.
Conclusions: The lasting favourable of DHA-
supplementation of pregnant and lactating mothers on
the BMI of their 21 months old infants could be due to
metabolic programming.

Background and Aims: The choice of formula for
infants born to HIV positive mothers in developing
countries who choose not to breast feed must be made
with the aim of ensuring the least risk of infection and
optimal growth. We investigated the effects of
acidification and addition of probiotics in two separate
but similar studies. Methods: Full term healthy infants
born to HIV positive mothers who had decided not to
breast feed were randomized within a week of birth to
either a standard starter formula, an acidified starter
formula or an acidified formula containing probiotics
(Bifido-bacterium lactis 2 X 107 cfu/g). The studies
were double blind and anthropometric measurements
were analyzed up to age 4 months. Results: A total of
333 infants were enrolled in the two studies of whom
271 were followed so that HIV status and growth
parameters could be analyzed. There were no
- 115 -
differences between those fed standard formulas and
acidified formulas without probiotics. The 98 infants fed
formula containing probiotics gained an average of
2.6g/day more than those without probiotics
(95%CI=[0.5;4.7]; p=0.015. A total of 34 infants were
HIV positive but there was no effect on weight gain
when only HIV positive infants were compared
(-4.3g/day - 95%CI=[-11.3;2.7]; p=0.22 NS). There
were no differences in the occurrence of gastrointestinal
or respiratory problems. Conclusions: Feeding infants
born to HIV positive mothers an acidified starter
formula with probiotics was safe and had a positive
effect on weight gain. Formulas and funding for these
studies was provided by Nestle Nutrition, Switzerland.

Background and Aims: Catch-up growth is essential in
preterm infants to ensure adequate development.
However, high rates of catch-up growth in early life
may increase the risk of obesity later on. We had
previously established that a blend of ingredients
increased growth recovery after neonatal stress in rats.
We aimed to: 1) Identify the ingredient(s) responsible
for this effect, and 2) Determine whether the nutritional
intervention affected body composition.
Methods: Rat pups were exposed to intermittent
maternal deprivation from postnatal days 2 to 14. After
precocious weaning, pups were fed from day 15 till day
35 with either a control diet or a similar diet adapted to
contain either LC-PUFA, inulin + galacto-
oligosaccharides, L. paracasei CNCM I-2116 or a blend
containing all ingredients. Animals from the non-
stressed control group were weaned at day 21 and fed
with the control diet until day 35.
Results: Body weight gain normalized by food intake
was lower in stressed animals receiving control diet or
individual ingredients than in non-stressed animals.
Only the blend diet restored this parameter relative to
the control non-stressed animals while no significant
differences were found in the fat pad weight between
these two groups.
Conclusions: A diet combining LC-PUFA, an
oligosaccharide mix and L. paracasei was able to restore
the growth rate that had been impaired by neonatal
stress and precocious weaning. This was linked to
improved food efficiency resulting from the synergy of
at least two of the ingredients and was not associated to
increased adiposity.

Background and Aims: The aim was to evaluate the
effects on growth, tolerance and effects on morbidity of
a new starter formula containing a probiotic (B longum
BL999) and prebiotics.
Methods: 138 healthy newborns were enrolled and
randomized in a prospective double blind study and
follow-up to 4 months of age. 69 newborns received the
experimental formula containing a probiotic
(Bifidobacterium longum ATCC BAA-999, - 2x107
cfu/g) and 4 g/L of a mixture of prebiotics (10% short
chain FOS, 90% GOS). The other 69 received a
commercially available formula (Nan® -Nestlé). Both
formulas contained LC-Pufas.
Results: Equivalence in weight gain could be
successfully shown. The difference in weight gain from
enrolment to 4 months was +1.1 g/day in the treatment
group, the 90% confidence interval (-1.0, 3.2) being
within the equivalence boundaries of ±±3.9 g/day. No
statistical difference could be found for length, head
circumference and BMI. The experimental group had
higher daily intake at the end of the trial ( = +82.35
ml/day, p=0.02), presented a higher stool frequency than
controls ( =0.35±0.14 /day, p=0.018), less green
(p=0.004) and more yellow (p=0.005) stools, less
flatulence (p=0.051) and less constipation (p=0.02) and
showed a trend to have less respiratory tract infections
(17 vs. 27, p= 0.088 NS).
Conclusions: Feeding a starter formula containing a
probiotic (B longum BL999) and prebiotics (FOS/GOS)
is safe in term of growth development, is well tolerated
and has a positive impact on nutritional tolerance,
reducing constipation. A tendency to a reduction in the
incidence of respiratory tract infections was observed.

Background and Aims: Protein and mineral enriched
post discharge formula probably improves growth of

seem to develop in the first weeks after discharge. Until
what age this formula is beneficial and whether the body
composition is influenced is unclear. Growth and body
composition of preterm infants fed enriched formula
- 116 -
until term or 6 months corrected age (CA) are
compared.
Methods: At term, preterm infants (bw 1500 gram
and/or ga 32 weeks) were randomized to a post
discharge formula (n=30, PDF) or a term formula (n=26,
TF). A control group of 12 infants was exclusively
breast fed until at least 3 months CA (BM). Until term,
all infants received preterm formula or fortified breast
milk. Anthropometry was performed at 0, 3 and 6
months CA. Body composition was measured by DXA
at 0 and 6 months CA.
Results: Preliminary results of the first 68 infants
participating in this blinded controlled study showed
only significant differences in the change in body
composition and not in growth (table). The differences
were merely found between formula-fed and BM infants
and mainly occurred in boys.
Conclusions: Normocaloric enriched formula after term
did not affect growth or body composition in formula-
fed preterm infants. Breast milk fed infants showed less
bone acquirement and a smaller increase in fat
percentage compared with normocaloric formula-fed
infants, however this did not result in a different bone
and fat mass at 6 months corrected age.
GENES AND RDS
M Hallman
Department of Pediatrics, University of Oulu, Finland
Background and Aims: Respiratory distress syndrome
(RDS) is a multifactorial developmental disease caused
by lung immaturity and presenting as high-permeability
lung edema (“hyaline membrane disease”). It is
characterized by a transient deficiency of alveolar
surfactant during the first week of life and a secondary
lung injury. During the first few days of life, the
alveolar surfactant pool size increases in size, reaching
the controls within the first week.
Methods: Here we describe the approach how to define
the genetic contribution to disease and discuss the
polymorphisms some genes that associate with
respiratory disease. The candidate genes studied thus far
have been chosen on the basis of phenotype respiratory
failure in lack-of-function mutations involving genes
encoding surfactant proteins (SP) (SP-B, SP-C), on the
basis of the regulatory role in the surfactant metabolism
and in the host defense (SP-A), and on the basis of the
established relationship to another generalized lung
disease (G protein-coupled receptor for asthma
susceptibility, GPR154 alias GPRA).
Results: The allelic variants of the genes encoding the
surfactant proteins (SP) SP-A1, SP-A2, SP-B, and SP-C
have been associated with RDS. Specific alleles affect
different risk categories, as defined by the degree of
prematurity, uterine size, or multiple pregnancy. The
main SP-A haplotype, interactively with the SP-B
Ile131Thr polymorphism and with constitutional and
environmental factors, influence the risk. Case reports
on mutations with partially functional SP-B have been
published. The genetic susceptibility factors depend on
the degree of prematurity at birth, consistent with
sequential differentiation of the lung and gestation-
dependent differences in clinical presentation.
According to recent report SP-C 138Asn associated with
RDS in extremely preterm infants (Rova et al. Eur J
Hum Gen 2004:12;312). In contrast, the near term
infants with RDS may share the same susceptibility and
protective GPRA haplotypes with asthma populations
(Pulkkinen, Haataja, et al. Ann Med 2006 in press). The
preferentially type 2 cell expressed genes involved in
processing of the surfactant complex (such as ATP-
binding cassette transporter 3, ABCA3) will likely serve
as candidate genes in future studies.
Conclusions: RDS associated with near-term and term
births may have a different genetic predisposition and
pathobiochemistry compared to RDS after very preterm
birth. Other multifactorial lung diseases may share some
genetic susceptibility factors with RDS. As we learn
more about the molecular consequences of allelic
variation, new therapies based on a new generation of
surfactant diagnostics and individualized therapies may
follow.

Background and Aims: Intrauterine infection is an
important cause of spontaneous preterm birth. However,
evidence based etiology of viral infection is still lacking.
This study aims to test the hypothesis that detection of
adenovirus in placenta tissue is associated with preterm
birth and to determine the placental histopathological
findings.
Methods: Placentas were collected from 193 deliveries,
71 premature deliveries and 122 at term. Detection of
adenovirus genome was tested by PCR assay. Placental
histology and immunohistochemistry with monoclonal
antibody CD45 were evaluated for signs of
inflammatory reaction in the positive for adenovirus
samples.
- 117 -
Results: Adenoviral genome was isolated in 54/193 of
placentas (28%). The frequency of placental adenovirus
detection in preterm versus term was significantly
increased {(29/71=41% versus 25/122= 20%; P=0.002,
OR=2.6 (95% CI 1.4-5.1)}. Stratification by gestational
age (GA) revealed a stronger association as GA
decreased (GA 29 weeks: OR=2.8; 95% CI 1.1-7.0 and
GA 30-33: OR=2.7; 95% CI 1.1-6.5). In the subgroup
34-36 weeks GA the association was no longer
significant (OR= 2.6; 95% CI 0.9-7.0). Adenoviral
genome detection followed the seasonal variation of
adenovirus respiratory infections (beginning of March to
end of June). Chronic villitis was present in 39.5% of
adenovirus-positive placentas without any difference
between term and preterm births.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that there is an
association between placental adenoviral genome
detection and spontaneous early premature birth.
Histological placental infection does not appear to be
the only mechanism inducing preterm labor. In addition,
the presence of adenoviral DNA does not necessarily
result in placental inflammation.
IMPAIRED CELLULAR IMMUNITY MAY
EXPLAIN HIGHER INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY
OF RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS IN
CHILDREN WITH DOWN SYNDROME

University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The
Netherlands
Background and Aims: Children with Down syndrome
have an increased susceptibility to infections, probably
due to an altered cellular and humoral immune response.
In this study the frequency of infections and
hospitalization of children with Down syndrome was
compared to healthy sibs and related to differences in
their cellular immunity.
Methods: Parents of 62 children with Down syndrome
and 57 of their healthy sibs were interviewed about the
frequency of infections and hospitalizations due to
infection. Also T-cell characteristics were analysed in
both groups.
Results: The frequency of respiratory tract infections
and associated hospitalization were higher in children
with Down syndrome (p<0.05; Table 1). The absolute
counts of total lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, CD4
positive T-lymphocytes and CD8 positive T-
lymphocytes were lower in Down children, especially in
the age group 2-5 years (p<0.05; data not shown).
Conclusions: The frequency of respiratory tract
infections and associated hospitalization is increased in
children with Down syndrome, compared to their
healthy sibs. Lower T-cell counts in children with Down
syndrome (partially) explain this finding.

Background and Aims: To evaluate trends of neonatal
respiratory distress (RD) regarding incidence, treatment
and mortality in a geographically defined population
over 30 years.
Methods: A questionnaire was sent to all primary,
secondary and tertiary neonatal units in Switzerland
every ten years between 1974 and 2004 asking for the
number of hospitalized patients with RD and hyaline
membrane disease (HMD), their treatment and
mortality. RD was defined as the presence of two of the
following symptoms for more than 15 minutes:
tachypnoe (>60/min), nasal flaring, retractions, central
cyanosis in room air and expiratory grunting.
Results: Number (mean: 5’300/year) and rate of
hospitalized newborns (7%) was stable over the 30
years. The proportion of patients with RD increased
from 1.9% to 3.8% of all lifeborns (mean: 78’800/year)
and from 29.7% to 52.8% of all hospitalized newborns.
The rate of HMD remained stable at around 8.5% of all
hospitalized patients. Treatment of RD changed
significantly over the three decades: mechanical
ventilation decreased from 31.4% to 16.3%, use of
CPAP increased from 8.8% in 1994 to 25.9% in 2004
and application of surfactant in HMD (introduced after
1984) raised to 48% in 1994 and 53% in 2004. Mortality
of patients with RD decreased from 15.5% (1974) to
3.5% (2004).
Conclusions: Whereas the introduction of preventive
and therapeutic means helped to stabilize the rate of
HMD and to decrease mortality over the last three
decades, the incidence of neonatal RD has almost
doubled in the same period, in particular in the
population with birth weight of >2500g.

Background and Aims: The incidence of SIRS may
have a genetic predisposition. Functionally significant
polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding Macrophage
Inhibitory Factor (MIF: -173) the RAGE receptor
(AGER 374A) the TLR4 receptor (+896A) were studied
in children admitted to 2 PICUs after informed consent
and LREC approval.. All of these SNPs down regulate
the host’s ability to mount an inflammatory response
and should be more prevalent in children without SIRS.
Methods: A total of 225 children from 2 centres were
recruited. Phenotype/genotype relationships were
analysed (225 children) using Pearson 2 statistics.
Phenotype was defined by the presence or absence of
SIRS as well as SOFA, PELOD and PIM scores.
Genotyping was performed using Taqman™ PCR.
Results: These are presented in Table 1.
Conclusions: Despite previously described associations
between MBL polymorphisms locus and susceptibility
to SIRS we were unable to demonstrate a similar
association with the 2 SNPs studied.

Background and Aims: Metachromatic
Leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare and fatal
demyelinating lysosomal storage disorder, due to the
inherited deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme
arylsulfatase A (ARSA). Currently no valid therapeutic
options are available for affected patients. Previously
described correlations between clinical presentation and
either residual enzymatic activity or common mutations
resulted respectively poorly informative or helpful in
predicting patient’s prognosis only in a minority of
MLD patients harboring common mutations.
Methods: We analyzed the complete ARSA gene in 23
MLD patients that we followed with periodical clinical
and instrumental evaluations.
Results: By examining the data obtained from
neurophysiologic and neuroradiologic evaluations of our
patients’ cohort and by critical reevaluation of the
existing literature, we demonstrated the occurrence of a
precise correlation between ARSA gene mutations and
age of onset and disease progression. This correlation
was evident not only for common mutations, but, most
importantly, for rare ones. Moreover, in the
absence/delay of molecular diagnosis, or in case of
newly identified mutations, the involvement of
peripheral nervous system since disease onset resulted a
sensitive prognostic marker for prediction of a severe
progression.
Conclusions: These data provide information on disease
prognosis and management, which can be useful for
prenatal testing, and patients’ selection for current and
future therapeutic options, such as hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation and gene therapy.

Ethics Working Group, Confederation of European
Specialists in Paediatrics, Kessel-Lo, Belgium
The Declaration of Helsinki (1964-2004) from the
World Medical Association provides the cornerstone for
ethics in biomedical research. This document has
become the focal point for debate regarding the ethical
acceptability of the conditions for medical research.
Helsinki has played a determining role in the
development of international and national guidelines
and regulations in research. In the area of paediatric
research, Helsinki has posed new questions and
challenges, and it has both reflected and pushed the
development of US, European, and international
considerations regarding the development of health
interventions for children. Within Europe, and CESP in
particular, the Declaration of Helsinki has played a
pivotal role in reflections on, and the promotion of,
ethical research in children. The presentation will show
the impact of the Declaration of Helsinki and the
international discussion on ethics in biomedical research
on paediatric research in Europe.

CROSS AGENCY WORKING AND
INFORMATION SHARING
T Berney
Prudhoe Hospital, Prudhoe, Northumberland, UK
Medical confidentiality, a contract that is at the heart of
the doctor-patient relationship, is complicated by the
inclusion of other parties: A. On the child's part, this is
an inevitable element for, as a minor, his/her interests
are represented by the parent. As the child moves
through adolescence, their right to privacy requires the
exclusion of the parent from the confidential
relationship, a process that is complicated by anything
that impairs the child's autonomy (notably intellectual
disability). Events such as abuse by the parents or
parental psychiatric disturbance, mean that their can be
so great a divergence between parental interests and the
child's. If the child does not have the competence to be a
full partner in the confidential relationship, the doctor
may find that this is then with a proxy outside the
family. B. On the doctor's part, good medical care
increasingly requires a team approach by an ill-defined
and variable group that is multidisciplinary and
multiagency. The boundaries of these teams often are so
diffuse and extensive as to be incomprehensible to a
child and family. They extend to include not just the
people the patient actually sees treating them but also
laboratory and pharmacy staff and, linked I a more
indirect fashion,. people such as the student and the
administrator. The team may include people employed
by other agencies - notably teacher and social worker -
the discipline not necessarily being a guide to the
employer. The difficulty is not only that different
agencies have different concepts and thresholds of
confidentiality but also that they have different reasons
for their involvement; they have their own agendas. A
concrete indicator of confidentiality is the circulation list
for clinical letters for it indicates the boundary of
confidentiality for that particular matter. Especially
where it includes the patient (a practice recently
introduced in England) for the practice defines the
extent to which the patient has the authority to control
the distribution of personal information. The letter also
defines their status in relation to their parents - are they
addressed to the patient or to the parents - as well as that
of other professionals involved in their care. Certain
issues regularly present the paediatrician with their own
difficulties such as the pregnant minor who does not
want their family to know, and the family in conflict
(short of clear-cut child abuse) who do not want other
agencies to be brought in. Child abuse brings its own
particular problems where the paediatrician can find
disclosure that is in his patient's best interests (to
prevent further injury to the child) shifting to disclosure
that is in the public interest (to prevent injury to other
children). Although the determinant of the degree of
disclosure is governed by the 'need to know,' partial
disclosure is not simple and, once the process has
started, it can be very unclear as to who has what
responsibility for continued confidentiality.
PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY IN
CHILDREN'S HEALTHCARE
P Thornton
Pear Tree Surgery, Kingsbury, Warwickshire, UK
It would be difficult to name a democracy in the
Western World that pays less respect to confidential
medical information than the United Kingdom.” It
would be easy to dismiss such criticism if it hadn’t come
from such an authoritive source. Dr John Havard was
speaking in 1989. He was then the secretary of the
British Medical Association (BMA), a barrister as well
as being qualified in medicine. In 2006, day in day out
large numbers of patients divulge highly sensitive
information to doctors and the information does not
seem to leak out into the public domain. From the
perspective of the doctor in clinical practice it is easy to
assume that is no great problem with medical
confidentiality. So was Havard wrong? Do patients with
hold important information from clinicians? What has
happened to standards, custom and practice in the
interim? Does current practice meet the requirements of
the Data Protection and Human Rights Acts? How will
the migration to electronic records improve or diminish
privacy for patients? At its Annual Representative
Meeting in June, the BMA changed its policy. They now
demand that patients should give explicit consent before
information is transferred on to the national database –
an “opt-in”. Connecting for Health are recommending
that information be transferred to the national spine
having simply informed patients by leaflet of the
database proposals. They regard it as sufficient to give
patients the facility to “opt-out”. But the “opt out” they
are offering is simply the use of software safeguards to
block the sharing of information via the database. It
remains their intention that “People should not be
offered the choice to opt out of recording their
healthcare data on National Care Records service.”And
this is against a the background of connecting for health
documents which confirm that the software safeguards
on offer – metaphorically dubbed “sealed envelopes” -
are not yet written and tested, will not be available in
time for the initial proposed uploads of summary
information from GP systems, will never work in
respect of scanned images of correspondence and can be
over ridden, contrary to the wishes of the patient.
Conflated with all of this we have the proposed national
Identity register and the two children’s registers by
which information about children and their parents will
be required to be shared.

PNEUMOCOCCAL CONJUGATE VACCINE:
IMPACT OF PREVENAR IN NORTH AMERICA
J D Kellner
Alberta, Canada
The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7,
Prevenar) was licensed and recommended for routine
use in all infants and high-risk children in the USA in
2000 and in Canada in 2001. Prevenar has been very
effective in both countries. Data from post-licensure
studies will be presented that show Prevenar has been
highly effective to prevent invasive pneumococcal
disease in vaccine recipients. Data will also be presented
to show the large indirect effect (herd immunity) in un-
immunized children and adults. Overall, more than 2
cases of invasive pneumococcal disease are prevented
indirectly for every case prevented directly. Another
benefit of Prevenar has been a reduction in the
prevalence of antibiotic resistant pneumococcal
infections. The impact of replacement disease with non-
vaccine serotypes has been small.
ROTAVIRUS INFECTIONS–THE VIRUS AND ITS
DISEASE, WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
K Johansen
Department of Virology, Immunology and Vaccinology
Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control, Sweden
Rotavirus infections are the leading cause of severe
dehydrating gastroenteritis, responsible for ~600,000
deaths per year worldwide in children less than 5 years of
age. Almost all children in developed and developing
countries acquire their first episode of rotavirus-induced
infection before their fifth birthday. Although >80% of
deaths due to rotaviruses occur in children in developing
countries significant morbidity and occasional deaths
occur in developed countries. Examination of rotavirus-
induced annual hospitalisation incidence from several
industrialized countries demonstrated a median rate of
445 per 100 000 children. The spectrum of symptoms that
rotaviruses induce ranges from mild, watery diarrhoea of
limited duration to fever, profuse diarrhoea and frequent
vomiting that may result in severe dehydration leading to
electrolyte imbalance and possibly death. It is difficult to
predict which child will develop severe disease and
complications to rotavirus-induced infections in
industrialized countries are poorly quantified. Rotavirus is
a well-known cause of community-acquired diarrhoea but
it is less well recognized as a major cause of nosocomial
infection in children although it is found consistently to
be one of the most common causes of hospital-acquired
diarrhoea. Two proteins of the outer capsid (VP4 and
VP7) induce neutralizing antibodies and are used for
genotyping, G-typing (the glycoprotein VP7) and P-
typing (the protease cleaving protein VP4). Due to the
segmented nature of the rotavirus genome (consisting of
11 segments of dsRNA) rotaviruses can reassort during
infection with multiple virus strains. Rotaviruses have
been detected in many species of wild and domestic
animals. Theoretically ~110 reassortments are possible
but it has been shown repeatedly in studies from different
parts of the world that G1, G2, G3, G4 and G9 contribute
to >95% of all rotavirus-induced diarrhoea. It will be
difficult to eradicate rotaviruses this is why a reasonable
goal for rotavirus vaccination is to eliminate severe
disease and hospitalization and decrease the total number
of rotavirus-induced infections.
PAEDIATRIC ROTAVIRUS GASTROENTERITIS:
TIME FOR VACCINATION!
F Gimenez-Sanchez
Advisory Committee of Vaccines, Spanish Association of
Pediatrics, Paediatric Infectious Diseases, Torrecardenas
Hospital, Almeria, Spain
The availability of rotavirus vaccination to reduce
Paediatric Rotavirus Gastroenteritis (PRG) burden in
Europe has stimulated efforts to characterize the real
burden of rotavirus. It is estimated that PRG results in
relatively few deaths per year in Europe, however, nearly
every child in Europe is infected with rotavirus by age 5
years and the majority will have gastroenteritis, resulting
in about 2.8 million cases cared at home, 700,000
outpatient visits and 87,000 hospitalisations.
A prospective, observational study (REVEAL) conducted
in seven study areas (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy,
Spain, Sweden, UK) between October 2004 to September
2005 confirmed the high burden of rotavirus infections in
Europe: 95% of PRG cases were in children above 6
months of age with more than 50% of hospitalisations and
emergency department visits due to PRGE. The mean
duration of hospitalisation varied between 2.5 to 5 days
with at least one parent who had to miss work in 66% of
families with a hospitalised child. In addition to causing
morbidity and mortality in children, Paediatric Rotavirus
Gastroenteritis creates a major economic burden on health
care systems and families in Europe. Recent study
(REVEAL) found that five globally common rotaviruses
serotypes (G1,G2,G3,G4 & G9) represent more than
98.5% of the circulating rotavirus strains in Europe.
Almost two decades ago, studies demonstrated that
rotaviruses serotypes (G1,G2,G3,G4) were predominant
with an emerging novel rotavirus type: G9. To effectively
reduce Paediatric Rotavirus Burden, a rotavirus vaccine
should have demonstrated its efficacy against those five
predominant rotavirus serotypes. Despite the significant
morbidity and costs associated with Rotavirus in Europe,
there is always a need to raise awareness of the rotavirus
disease among European physicians and policy-makers in
order to help the decision-making process about
recommendation and use of rotavirus vaccination in each
country. In industrialised countries, if widely used,
rotavirus vaccination could substantially reduce the
number and associated costs of child hospitalisations and
clinical visits for acute diarrhoea as well as office visits
and burden on the family.
ROTATEQ®: ENSURE SUCCESSFUL
VACCINATION
P Heaton
Merck Research Laboratories, USA
The pentavalent human-bovine (WC3) reassortant
rotavirus vaccine (RotaTeq® - Merck & Co., Inc.) was
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and
- 119b -
the European Medicines Agency earlier this year, with
registration and/or filing in multiple countries. The
vaccine, which is provided in a ready-to-use liquid
formulation, was demonstrated to be generally well
tolerated and efficacious in Phase III studies conducted in
11 countries worldwide, preventing 98% of severe
rotavirus gastroenteritis and reducing rotavirus-related
hospitalizations and emergency visits by 95%.
Reductions in rotavirus-related health care contacts were
comparable across geographic regions and across
different serotypes including G1, G2, G3, G4, and
P1A[8]-containing G9 strains. The vaccine did not show
evidence of an increase in intussusception and was well
tolerated with respect to other adverse experiences of
special clinical interest for rotavirus vaccines, including
fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. This presentation will
provide an update of the clinical safety and efficacy data
from the Phase III studies.

Background and Aims: As the structure and financing
of health and pharmaceutical care changes, families
provide increasingly complex home oxygen treatment
for their chronically ill children who are oxygen
dependent.
Methods: We describe the clinical care of a child who
was born prematurely and developed severe respiratory
distress syndrome requiring ventilation in special care
baby unit.
Results: The Child stayed in special care baby unit for
several weeks and developed chronic lung disease. Once
the decision was made that the patient is fit to go home
on oxygen treatment, a planning meeting took place for
discharge. An individualized care plan was drawn up.
Prior to discharge, the parents received advice on the
use of equipments, administration of medication and
oxygen treatment. The factors contributing to create a
serious stress within a family, the impact of chronic lung
disease and delivery of home oxygen treatment on the
family and the child will be discussed.
Conclusions: Families require information and
assistance in using home oxygen. Adequate support for
care giving families extends well beyond teaching them
medical,pharmaceutical and technical care.It is the role
of doctors,pharmacists and nurses to advocate for
restructuring of health services on the use of home
oxygen treatment for the chronically ill patients.

NEUROTOXICITY OF HYPEROXIA IN
CORTICAL NEURONAL CULTURE
M Toennessen, M Berns, B Gerstner, M Obladen
Department of Neonatology, Charité Virchow Hospital,
Berlin, Germany
Background and Aims: A growing body of evidence
indicates that hyperoxia affects apoptotic processes
especially in unmature neuronal cells of premature
infants. In the developing rat brain and in cell culture
hyperoxia has been identified to cause
neurodegeneration. We therefore examined the effects
of hyperoxia in cultured rat neuronal cells at different
maturation stages.
Methods: Primary cortical neuronal cultures were
prepared from Wistar rat embryos at 18 days gestation
and exposed to hyperoxia (80%) for 48 h at different
maturation stages (division 7 for immature neuronal
culture, and division 14 for mature neuronal culture).
Control cells were kept in normoxia. Cell viability was
assessed by the methyltetrazolium method (MTT) and
lactate dehydrogenase release (LDH). Cells showed
morphologic changes consistent with apoptosis.
Involvement of caspases was shown by assessment of
caspase-3-like-activity, and accumulation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) was shown by CM-H2DCF-DA-
assay.
Results: Hyperoxia reduced cell viability by 29.1% vs
controls (p<0.05) at division 7 and by 18,3% vs controls
(p<0.05) at division 14 whereas LDH release
significantly increased. Exposure to hyperoxia leads to
oxidative stress and time dependent accumulation of
ROS [127.5% after 6 h exposure, and 202.8% after 24 h
exposure to hyperoxia vs controls (p<0.05)]. Hyperoxia
caused a significant increase of caspase-3-like-activity
after a 24 h period (150.9%) vs control (p<0.05).
Conclusions: We conclude that a hyperoxia leads to
apoptosis of especially immature neurons. We speculate
that in premature infants oxygen exposure may
exacerbate neuronal damage and contribute to
neurological impairment.

n=6) or WIN + the CB2 antagonist SR144528 (2 mg/kg;
n=6) were administered. Control group had sham
surgery without hypoxia or treatment. Brain magnetic
resonance imaging (T2WI, DWI, ADC maps) was
performed at 24h, 72h and 7 days after HI (Biospec
47/40, 7 Tesla). Then, rats were perfused with 4%
paraformaldehyde and brains removed for Nissl staining
and GFAP inmmunofluorescence.
Results: 24 h after HI, vehicle rats showed in MRI an
ipsilateral area of mixed edema (T2WI augmented and
ADC reduced; 17.2±2.6% of brain volume), which
evolved to necrosis at 7 d (T2WI and ADC augmented;
16.4±1.6%). In WIN, MRI at 24 h was similar to
vehicle, but damaged area evolved to T2WI
hyperintense area reduction (6.6±1.2%, ANOVA
p<0.05) and ADC normalization. In agreement, number
of viable neurones increased and reactive gliosis was
reduced in cortex in WIN as compared with vehicle. The
antagonism of CB1 or CB2 receptors reversed the
effects of WIN.
Conclusions: Administration of the cannabinoid
WIN55212 after HI reduced brain damage seemingly by
promoting the salvage of viable tissue. Supported by

NEUROTOXICITY OF BILIRUBIN AND
IBUPROFEN IN CORTICAL NEURONAL
CULTURE

Department of Neonatology, Charité, Campus Virchow
Klinikum, Berlin, Germany
Background and Aims: Preterm infants are on risk for
bilirubin associated brain damage. In cell cultures
bilirubin causes neuronal apoptosis and necrosis.
Ibuprofen is used for closing the ductus arteriosus which
usually occurs at an age when hyperbilirubinemia is on
its maximum. Ibuprofen interferes with bilirubin–
albumin-binding. We therefore examined the effects of
bilirubin in combination with ibuprofen in rat neuronal
cultures.
Methods: Primary cortical neuronal cultures were
prepared from Wistar rat embryos at 18 days gestation
and exposed to ibuprofen (7.5-1000 μg/ml) alone or in
combination with bilirubin (1-10 μM) for 48 h. Control
cells were kept in normoxia. Cell viability was assessed
by the methyltetrazolium method (MTT) and lactate
dehydrogenase release (LDH). DNA-fragments as
marker of apoptosis was measured by elisa.
Results: Incubation with increasing concentrations of
ibuprofen reduced cell viability by 68% vs controls
(p<0.05) above a concentration of 125 μg/ml whereas
LDH release increased from 29% to 36% above 62.5
μg/ml (p<0.01). Placebo did not affect cell viability.
Coincubation with bilirubin (10 μM) and 250 μg/ml
ibuprofen caused significant (p<0.01) additional loss of
MTT cleavage and increased LDH release. DNA-
fragmentation increased likewise.
Conclusions: We conclude that coincubation of
ibuprofen in suprtherapeutic and bilirubin in low
concentration results in stronger detrimental effects on
neurons than ibuprofen or bilirubin alone. Our results
- 124 -
suggest that exposure of preterm infants to ibuprofen
may increase the risk for bilirubin encephalopathy.

Background and Aims: Previous studies have shown
that resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound found in
grapes and wine, has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory
properties in experimental models of ischemia-
reperfusion injuries. Aim of this study was to investigate
whether resveratrol: a) has neuroprotective effect on
hypoxia-ischemia (HI) induced brain damage in
neonatal rats and b) exerts its action through inhibition
of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).
Methods: At postnatal day 7 rats were separated into 3
groups: A (control) sham operated, B (HI) ligated and
exposed to hypoxia for 1h and C (R-HI) post-treated
with resveratrol (90mg/kg in 2 equal doses). At P10,
based on the gross morphologic appearance of the
infarction, brains were grouped in 4 categories (normal,
mild, moderate and severe). Histological analysis was
performed at the level of dorsal hippocampus according
to a semiquantitative 5-point scale. iNOS expression
was estimated using immunohistochemistry.
Results: Neonatal HI resulted in extensive neuronal
damage that was limited after resveratrol administration
(p<0.05). The majority of the R-HI group exhibit normal
to mild damage and histologic evaluation showed a
significant protection of cells in the cerebral cortex and
hippocampus. Immunohistochemical study showed that
1h of hypoxia led to the increased iNOS
immunoreactivity in the hippocampus and the
boundaries of the damaged cerebral cortex whereas
resveratrol diminished iNOS expression.
Conclusions: Resveratrol attenuated the effects of HI on
the neonatal brain by reducing the progression of
neuronal injury. iNOS inhibition seems to be implicated
in its action. The results of the present study are
encouraging for the contribution of this natural
phytoalexin to neuroprotection.

Background and Aims: The astroglial protein S100 is a
marker of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) leakage and an
early indicator of brain damage. To evaluate the
neuroprotective efficacy of MgSO4 treatment in a
hypoxic-ischemic event (HI) using protein S100 as brain
damaged tissue-marker in preterm lambs.
Methods: 20 fetal lambs (133 days) were randomly
assigned to: One control group (sacrificed 3 hour after
delivery) and three hypoxic-ischemic groups (one
immediately sacrificed and two others receiving or not
400 mg/kg of MgSO4 during 20 minutes and sacrificed
3 hours after HI event). Injury was induced by partial
occlusion of umbilical cord during 60 minutes. Brains
were fixed, divided in different regions, disgregated and
immunolabelled for protein S100. Samples were
analyzed by flow citometry and positive cells were
evaluated. One-factor ANOVA was performed (p<0.05).
Results: HI group sacrificed immediately after the
injury (0h) did not show differences of S100 levels in
comparison to control one in all brain regions (cortex:
56.8 ± 13 vs. 59 ± 16%; inner zones: 57.4 ± 9.3 vs. 56.6
± 12.1%, respectively). However, S100 levels were
significantly decreased in the group sacrificed 3 hours
after HI injury in comparison to control and 0h HI group
(cortex: 8.6 ± 5.2%; inner zones: 8.2 ± 5.5%). The
administration of MgSO4 give rise to values similar to
control group (cortex: 63.6 ± 9.7%; inner zones: 53.4 ±
9.5%).
Conclusions: Our results show that MgSO4 treatment
after the HI event maintains protein S100 levels similar
to control group, suggesting that MgSO4 treatment
avoids the BBB dysfunction. Grants: 9/UPV00077.327-

Background and Aims: Defining outcome in HIE is
important, especially in Sarnat grade II, for counselling
parents and early therapeutic intervention.
Methods: Case report: Female, outborn, GA 41 weeks,
spontaneous delivery, AS 2-3-5, umbilical artery pH 7.1,
BE -16 mmol/L, meconium stained amniotic fluid,
intubated and ventilated at birth. Referred to our NICU
at 2 hrs of life for asphyxia and meconium inhalation.
Sarnat 2 HIE was diagnosed on admission. At 12 hrs of
life, clinical seizures appeared, amplitude-EEG showed
a discontinuous normal voltage pattern that recovered to
normal (CNV) at 20 hrs with epileptic activity until 25
hrs. At 4 days, after crises of apnoea and bradycardia, a-
EEG showed a CNV pattern with recurrent seizures.
Traditional EEG showed left temporal regions spikes.
- 125 -
At 6 days 1H-MRS detected a reduction of NAA/Cr and
an increase of lactate and lipids in the left frontal-
parietal white matter; a reduction of ADC was observed
in the same areas. First day cranial ultrasound showed
parasagittal hyperechogenicity no longer visible after 2
wks. 1H-MRS and DWI at 6 months were normal.
Results: Outcome showed no sensorineural deficits;
general movements, neurological examination and
psychomotor development were normal at 6 months
(GQ 125).
Conclusions: Although ultrasound, DWI and 1H-MRS
were all abnormal in the 1st wk of life, the patient
showed a normal outcome at 6 months of age. The only
normal examination in the first 24 hrs of life was the a-
EEG, suggesting, as reported in literature, the high
accuracy of this tool in predicting outcome.

Background and Aims: In a randomized controlled
trial erythropoietin (epo) was given to preterm infants to
study potential neuroprotective effects. Within this
framework the aim was to assess, whether the relatively
high dose of epo affects the cerebral blood circulation.
Methods: Sixteen newborn infants with 28.8±2.2 weeks
gestational age and 1167±382g birthweight were
enrolled and received either 3000U/kg epo (epo-group,
N=10) or placebo (placebo-group, N=6) i.v. A near
infrared spectroscopy sensor (HamamatsuTM
NIRO-300)
was placed on the head of each infant. The differences
between the baseline before the injection and the first
(period A) and second 10min (period B) and the
following 30 min (period C) after injection were
calculated for tissue oxygenation index (TOI) and
hemoglobin index (THI) and compared between the two
groups.
Results: The demographic data was similar between
both groups, only the Apgar score at 1 min was
significantly lower for the placebo-group. The following
differences±SE were observed for the periods A, B, C,
respectively: TOI (in %): -1.7±1.0, -4.3±2.1, -5.8±2.7,
THI (in μM): 0.1±1.9, -2.2±4.2, -3.9±4.5. None of the
differences was statistically significant (p>0.05),
although for all differences in TOI there was a trend
(p<0.1). The initial TOI before the injection was
considerably but not significantly higher by 10.6±6.7%
in the epo-group, which may be a factor contributing to
the decrease in TOI in this group. Despite the decrease
the mean TOI in the epo-group remained higher than in
the placebo-group throughout the observation period.
Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest that
erythropoietin may affect cerebral blood circulation.

Background and Aims: NIRS is a successful technique
to measure cerebral oxygenation, but its use is limited to
cortical zones. So, the combination with experimental
procedures, like transient time flow or microspheres
injection, is a better approach to determine regional or
total cerebral perfusion. To compare cortical
oxygenation measured by NIRS and transient time flow
of hypoxic piglets induced by 8% FiO2.
Methods: 6 piglets with 5-9 postnatal days were used
(86/609 EC). Animals were tracheostomised and IPPV
was established. Lung mechanics (VT, Raw, CL, din)
were determined. Femoral artery catheter was placed to
obtain blood samples, to measure cardiac output (CO),
heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). A
transient time flow probe was placed around carotid
artery to measure cerebral blood flow (CF). Cerebral
oxygenation was determined by NIRS. Hypoxia was
induced by reduction of FiO2 at 8% during 20 min. Data
represented by mean ± SD. One-factor ANOVA was
performed (p<0.05).
Results: After hypoxia, gas exchange was PaO2: 38±11
mmHg; PaCO2: 41±10 mmHg; pH: 7.1±0.1. No
changes were observed on lung mechanics. Hypoxia
induced a decreased on: CO 1.0±0.2 vs 0.5±0.3
L/min/kg; CF 77±35 vs 38±23 mL/min; HR 259±22 vs
177±56 bpm; MAP 88±11 vs 31±5 mmHg. Satured
(O2Hb: -0.3±1.9 vs -20.4±9.9), desatured (cHb: 0.5±2.3
vs 9.6±2.2) and total (HHb: 0.4±1.4 vs 29.9±9.8)
hemoglobin demonstrated a significantly change.
Conclusions: Transient changes on cerebral
oxygenation are demonstrated by NIRS. Hypoxia
produced a severe hemodynamic compromise,
correlated to a decrease on cerebral blood flow and
oxygenation. Grants: C03/11; FIS PI030987 &

Background and Aims: An on-line neonatal seizure
detection algorithm (Navakatikyan et al) based on wave-
- 126 -
sequence analysis previously compared favourably
against the Gotman et al (1997) algorithm (Sensa
software 5.4) on a dataset of conventional multi-channel
EEG. However, devices with a limited number of
channels are important for long-term monitoring and
ICU. Aim of the study was to evaluate the Navakatikyan
algorithm on a two-channel EEG dataset.
Methods: The Navakatikyan algorithm was assessed on
56 one-hour two-channel EEG files (BRM2 Brain
Monitor, BrainZ Instruments Ltd, New Zealand). The
records were independently marked for seizures by four
pediatric neurologists. Performance of the Navakatikyan
algorithm was compared to the performance of the
Gotman algorithm against each of the four specialists.
Performance of the specialists was also compared
against each other. Conservative and liberal assessments
of algorithm performance were used, based on detected
seizure duration.
Results: Conservative assessment: Sensitivities of the
Navakatikyan algorithm, the Gotman algorithm and the
specialists were 59, 16 and 76%, respectively. Positive
predictive values (PPV) were 63, 56 and 76%.
Correlations were 0.56, 0.25 and 0.71. Liberal
assessment: Sensitivities were 82, 70 and 84%. PPVs
were 70, 59 and 84%. Rates of false positives per hour
were 0.7, 2.8 and 1.2, respectively. Thus, in all
categories the Navakatikyan algorithm performed better
than the Gotman algorithm, with similar performance to
that of the neurologists.
Conclusions: The Navakatikyan algorithm performed
well and provides a basis for major improvements in
neonatal seizure detection. References: Navakatikyan at

Background and Aims: During the last few years it is
possible to use continuous EEG to monitor brain
function. ECMO represent a high risk procedure where
monitoring cerebral function could be critical to help
clinical decisions. Compare Cerebral Function
Monitoring (CFM) with classical two channel EEG and
biespectral index (BIS) in newborns during ECMO
support.
Methods: Prospective observational study with CMF
using the Olympic CMF 6000 and continuous EEG with
CSA and BIS. The quality and characteristic of the
traces and diagnostic support were analyzed.
Results: From July 2003 until January 2006, 22
newborns on ECMO were studied. 44,5% of them were
Cardiac ECMO in congenital cardiac malformations
during post surgery. 13,6% of all patients required
cardiopulmonary resuscitation or had severe hypoxemia
before ECMO. Seizure activity was recorded in 31% of
all. Mean duration of CFM was 120 hours and 26 min,
the dominant patter was the discontinuous normal
voltage pattern. The low voltage in the left brain
hemisphere by edema did not modified mono-channel
aEEG. Only when high doses of analgesic agents were
used the amplitutude of the traces were reduced: burst
suppression and continuous low voltage with BIS of
< 30. Only seizures accompanied by worsening of base
activity anticipate severe neurological complications
confirmed by neuro-image.
Conclusions: CFM is a helpful monitoring system in
patients on ECMO. Gives information about seizures
activity and have a prognostic value depending on the
background patterns.

Background and Aims: Nitric oxide is involved in the
pathophysiology of seizures in a multifunctional way.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of nNOS
inhibition on seizures-induced neurodegeneration, by
examining the expression of BAX, an apoptosis marker.
Methods: Wistar rats (10-11-d-old) were divided into 4
groups: A, B, C and D (control). Groups A, B and C
were subjected to hypoxic conditions. At P21-P22, rats
of groups B and C were administered with kainic acid
(KA 10mg/kg i.p) and group C was pre-treated with 7NI
(50mg/kg i.p). The BAX and nNOS expression was
examined by immunohistochemistry in the rat
hippocampus at 4,24,48 and 72 hours after KA
administration and prolonged seizures.
Results: In the H/KA group, nNOS expression is
increased at 4h, compared to control, with especially
strong immunostaining in normal neurons at 24h. In the
7NI group, expression is obviously reduced at 4h,
increased at 24h, although at lower levels than group B.
At 48h, both group B and C present the baseline level.
In H/KA group the induction of BAX immunoreactivity
is apparent at 4h, with stronger immunostaining in
degenerated neurons, becomes more intense at 24h, both
in normal and dying neurons and is reduced after 48h in
intact neurons. In comparison with the 7NI group, there
is a moderate difference starting at 24 hours, in favor of
the 7NI group.
Conclusions: The inhibition of nNOS following the
administration of 7NI had a moderate effect on the BAX
expression, indicating a slight attenuation of seizures-
induced apoptotic cell death.

Background and Aims: Cerebral palsy (CP) is a
nonprogressive motor disorder caused by white matter
damage in the developing brain. It is often accompanied
with neurocognitive and sensory disabilities. The cause
and pathogenesis of CP is multifactorial and continues
to be poorly understood. Chorioamnionitis, clinically
silent or manifest, has been reported to be a risk factor
for CP both in term and preterm infants. IL1beta gene
was mapped to chromosome 2q14 and a few
polymorphisms associated with altered IL1beta
production have been described. Increased IL1beta
levels have been found in peripheral blood in septic
neonates and can be associated with the development of
cerebral palsy. The aim of our study was to estimate
allelic frequency for two promoter SNPs in IL1beta
gene, -31 and -511 in the children with CP.
Methods: DNAs obtained from peripheral blood of 27
CP patients and 162 unrelated healthy volunteers were
genotyped for the IL1beta -31 and -511 SNP using real-
time PCR TaqMan® SNP genotyping assays.
Results: IL1beta allele variants -31T and -511C were
more common in the population with cerebral palsy in
the comparison to healthy volunteers.
Conclusions: The significance of the association
between IL1beta gene polymorphisms and cerebral
palsy has to be investigated in the future studies. This
work was supported by grant #0098108 from the

Background and Aims: Studies about prognostic value
of cerebral US have consisted of small numbers of
patients and have showed contrasting results. US is a
safe and greatly used bedside examination and it is
useful to continue to report data about its prognostic
value.
Methods: 26 newborns affected by HIE (Sarnat
grading) were studied by US in the first 72 hrs of life.
Pathological US were defined having diffuse
hyperecogenicity and slit ventricles, isolated parasagittal
hyperecogenicity, talamic and basal ganglia
hyperecogenicity. At 12-18 months of life a motor
evaluation and a psychomotor assessment (Griffith test)
were performed by an expert psychiatrist and
psychologist. Visual and hearing function were
evaluated during the first year of life. Motor outcome
was classified as normal, transient hypertonia and
cerebral palsy.
Results: 17 patients had a normal motor outcome, 6
developed transient hypertonia and 3 cerebral palsy.
PPV of US for CP and transient hypertonia were 50%
(CI 24-50%) and 75% (CI 47-91%) (p<0.01),
respectively; NPV were 100% (CI 91-100%) and 83%
(CI 71-91%) (p<0.01). Among brain lesions,
parasagittal hyperecogenicity resulted in normal
outcome, basal ganglia hyperecogenicity in transient
hypertonia and diffuse brain damage in CP. Mean (SD)
general quotient in normal and abnormal US were 103
(12) and 72 (30) (p=0.006), respectively. Visual
impairment was detected in 8 children and was not
predictable by US (p>0.05).
Conclusions: Early US imaging is quite accurate in
predicting CP in patients affected by HIE, especially
when diffuse brain edema is detected. Isolated
parasagittal or basal ganglia hyperecogenicity do not
correlate with poor outcome.

Background and Aims: Superoxide dismutase-1
(SOD-1) plays an important role in oxygen radical brain
homeostasis. Neonatal transgenic mice overexpressing
SOD-1 are more susceptible to hypoxic injury than adult
transgenic mice. The activity of SOD-1 is higher in full
term infants than in preterm infants. SOD-1 activity in
newborn transgenic mice was assessed for 10 days.
Methods: 6 heterozygote litters with a total of 33 light
producing transgenic reporter mice (CD-1-Tg(Sod1-
luc)Xen), containing a 15.5kb mouse superoxide
dismutase-1 (SOD-1) gene promoter, were imaged using
the Xenogen imaging system. This includes a CCD
camera to detect luminescence in luciferin injected
mice. SOD-1 Activity (luminescence expressed as
photons) was observed primarily in the brain, liver and
skin.
Results: Newborn mice show a near 2-fold activity of
SOD-1 in the brain during the first day of life compared
to the activity at 10 days, with a significant rise from
day 1 compared to day 5 (p<0.0001). The activity
peaked at day 5 with a 2.5-fold increase compared to the
activity at day 10 (p<0.0001).
Conclusions: There is a statistically significant dynamic
change in SOD-1 during the first days of life. This may
play an important role in oxygen tolerance in the
newborn.

Shore Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia
Background and Aims: Applying positive pressure
ventilation to premature infants may diminish cerebral
blood flow and cardiac output. Low brain and upper
body flow (superior vena cava flow, SVC) is a risk
factor for cerebral ischaemia and intraventricular
haemorrhage in preterm infants, with previous research
showing mean airway pressure as a significant
determinant of SVC flow. It is not known whether this is
a direct effect of positive pressure ventilation or a
reflection of severity of lung disease. We investigated
the effect of increasing PEEP on systemic blood flow at
different gestations and with increasing postnatal age.
Methods: Ventilated newborns were measured before
and 10 minutes after increasing PEEP from 5 to 8
cmH2O. Simultaneous echocardiographic and
respiratory function measurements were collected
between 3 and 9 hours of age, then daily if still
ventilated.
Results: Sixty-nine studies in 50 infants were
performed. Overall, increased PEEP was associated with
a significant reduction in right ventricular output (mean
difference -12 ml/kg/min), but not in SVC flow, or left
pulmonary or middle cerebral artery mean velocities.
Lung compliance was increased and lung resistance
decreased after 10 minutes of higher PEEP (mean
difference +0.08 ml/cmH2O/kg and -16 cmH2O/L/s).
There was a weak positive correlation between change
in SVC flow and change in lung compliance.
Conclusions: A short-term increase in PEEP does not
lead to a significant change in systemic blood flow in
most infants. The intervention can improve dynamic
lung function, especially airway resistance.
Improvements in compliance tend to be associated with
improvements in blood flow.

Background and Aims: Atherosclerosis and childhood
obesity are the most frequent disorders in Czech
population. Influence of the genetic factors on
atherosclerosis and obesity is known. We analyzed
relationship between anthropometric, biochemical
values and genetic polymorphisms in apolipoprotein B
gene.
Methods: We collected and tested from January 1999 to
December 2004, 51 patients with artherosclerosis and 99
patients with childhood obesity. In both groups we
analyzed by basic molecular genetic techniques (blood
sample DNA isolation, polymerase chain reaction,
restriction fragment length polymorphisms method and
electrophoresis) two promotor Apo B gene
polymorphisms.
Results: Anthropometric and biochemical data were
compared with tested genetic polymorphisms
(Mendelian randomization). Linkage between low
density lipoprotein level (T allele presented) and
cholesterol, LDL and apolipoprotein B levels (CC
genotype presented) were observed different.
Conclusions: We suppose that atherosclerosis and
childhood obesity are pathological units influenced by
wide range of genes. Possible linkage between Apo B
gene promotor polymorphisms occurrence and
biochemical levels of relevant protein products is
described. Genotype - phenotype relationship and
anthropometric consequences of tested gene
polymorphisms are discussed. This study was supported
by Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, Czech
Republic, grant no. 1M06014.

Background and Aims: There are several brands of
pulse oximeters, but accuracy and reliability differ and
there is lack of validation in neonates. We wanted to
compare the accuracy of three pulse oximeters
compared with arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), and
time consumption to a stable value.
Methods: The measurements were performed on
neonates who needed an arterial line. SaO2 was
measured from blood sample taken from an umbilical
artery catheter and analysed with a RadiometerABL735.
The pulse oximeters used were NellcorOxiMaxN-550.
MasimoSETRadicalTM
. MiniCorrOximeterBCI3402. 42
measurements were performed on 21 patients, GA 23.4-
41.3 weeks, age 1-25 days. On each infant, two different
random monitors were used, on two different feet. The
- 129 -
time until a stable SpO2 was registered, and a SaO2 was
measured.
Results: The monitors had a tendency to show lower
values when SaO2 was high and opposite when SaO2
was low. The mean absolute deviation was 2.79, 1.96
and 3.19 respectively. Gender, gestational age, age and
blood pressure did not influence the results. There were
no significant differences in time to stable values.
Conclusions: Presumed that arterial oxygen saturation
is the true value, there were significant difference
between the monitors in accuracy and reliability. This is
of importance when used as a screening tool for
congenital heart diseases.

Background and Aims: Cardiac tumors are rare in
infants and children but are a serious cause of morbidity
and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the clinical
characteristics of our patients with cardiac tumor.
Methods: 13 patients with cardiac tumor diagnosed
between 1994 and 2005 were evaluated retrospectively.
There was a clear male predominance, M : F = 12:1.
Three patients also had congenital heart disease (1 ASD,
1 VSD, and 1 VSD and pulmonary stenosis).
Results: Age range was 5 days to 3 years. Clinical
presentation was with a cardiac murmur in 7 patients,
syncope in two, and convulsion in one. In two patients
echocardiography was made for other reasons. One
patient was diagnosed with antenatal ultrasonography.
Four patients underwent surgery for resection of the
tumor and only biopsy was made in two.
Histopathologic diagnosis was rhabdomyoma in three,
fibroma in one, myxoma in one, and malignant
mesenchymal tumor in one patient. Seven patients had
been diagnosed by echocardiography. Four patients had
tuberosclerosis and three of them had rhabdomyoma.
The patient with tuberosclerosis and multiple cardiac
masses with no histopathological diagnosis died due to
intractable supraventricular tachycardia. The patient
with malignant mesenchymal tumor died after the
operation. One patient with a mass in the left ventricle
who could not have operation was learned to die later
on.
Conclusions: Cardiac tumors are rare in children and
should be suspected in case of cardiac murmur, syncope,
and cerebrovascular events. Prognosis is usually poor in
unresectable cases.
FALSE TENDONS AS A ANATOMIC
SUBSTRATE FOR IDIOPATHIC VENTRICULAR
TACHYCARDIA
M I Kelmendi, R H Bejiqi
Department of Cardiology, University Children's
Hospital, Prishtina, Serbia and Montenegro
Background and Aims: Left ventricular false tendons
(FT) are fibrous or fibromuscular bands that stretch
across the left ventricle from the septum to the free wall.
They are the most frequent cause of innocent murmur in
childhood and can be seen in up to 50% of children
examined with 2D echo. Numerous reports indicate the
incidence of the coexistence of left ventricular false
tendons and premature ventricular contractions. The aim
of this study is to determine the incidence of false
tendons in children with heart murmur and to stress the
link between false tendons and idiopathic ventricular
tachicardia in some of those cases.
Methods: 2015 children with heart murmur are
examined at University Children's Hospital Echo lab,
using Doppler echo with it's modalities.
Results: Most of examined children showed a various
congenital and acquired heart disease, while in 274 pts
(13.6%) were detected only left ventricular false
tendons. There were different types of FT: thin, thick,
longitudinal, transversal, multiple .... A small number of
pts with false tendons have other congenital or acquired
heart disease, and 220 of these patients (80.3%) were
judged to have no underlying heart disease. Of 220
subjects with FT, 12 (5.5%) manifested premature
ventricular contractions; two children of this group
underwent catheter ablation.
Conclusions: Like other authors data, our results
indicate false tendons may play an etiologic role in the
genesis of premature ventricular complexes in
apparently normal heart.

Medical University, Donetsk, Ukraine
Background and Aims: The heart arrhythmias (HA)
make influence not only a physical condition of the
child, but also on psychology of his behaviour,
emotional reactions, his place in a social life that is why
the effective help to this patients is impossible without
the evaluation of quality of life (Qol). To study the Qol
in children with HA.
Methods: 97 children (53 girls and 44 boys) at the age
6-18 years old with different HA were examined. All
children completed the own special questionnaire
'Assessment of the quality of life in children with heart
arrhythmias' (UA, Pat. 12262, 61 10/02,
200509883).
Results: At receipt actively showed complaints only
half of patients with HA, at other examined they have
been revealed at testing. Decrease in Qol have noted in
78,9±5,4% of children with HA, thus in 35,1±6,3% of
children it has been considerably lowered. Main causes
- 130 -
of decrease in Qol were disturbances of psycho-
emotional status (85,6±3,6%): the increased anxiety,
irritability, various disturbances of a dream, fears, fast
fatigue and the general weakness, melancholy, grief.
Disturbances of health’s state have noted in 78,9±5,4%
of patients with HA due to headache, cardiac pain,
dizziness, frequent pulse.
Conclusions: Disturbances of psycho-emotional and the
vegetative status in children with HA are such
significant for the patients, as the symptoms of
arrhythmia. Received data grounded the inclusion to the
therapy of the children with HA the psychotherapeutic
measures, vegetative system stabilizing and
psychopharmacological medicines with the purpose to
optimize children’s treatment, as an alternative to anti-
arrhythmic drugs, dangerous in this age.

Background and Aims: Elevation of low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a recognised risk factor
for premature atherosclerosis and such elevations have
their antecedents in the paediatric population. This study
evaluated the frequency of elevated LDL cholesterol in
children and adolescents in whom one parent had a
history of premature ischaemic heart disease.
Methods: The Cardiac Rehabilitation database at Mayo
General Hospital was searched between 2001 – 2005 to
determine individuals with a history of premature (< 55
years) ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Parents were
subsequently surveyed to determine the number of
children. Inclusion criteria were children and
adolescents 8 – 18 years having one parent with
premature IHD. Patients had a fasting lipid profile and
results were classified as acceptable, borderline/high or
high in accordance with American Academy of
Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines. Those with high levels
were screened for secondary causes of hyperlipidaemia.
Normative data inclusive of height and weight were
obtained and parental risk factor profiles were
ascertained.
Results: Fifty-two parents had a total of 97 children and
adolescents who were eligible for screening. Ninety-
three initially consented and fasting lipid profiles were
obtained in 82 children (84.5%). Reasons for non-
participation included potential school loss and needle
phobia. Prevalences of high and borderline/high LDL
cholesterol were (7/82) 8.5% and (17/82) 20.7%
respectively.
Conclusions: Given the high incidence of abnormal
results, screening of high risk children and adolescents
is prudent, however follow-up care must be offered to
this population.

Background and Aims: Problem of heart arrhythmias
during the last decennial event is one of the most actual
in children’s cardiology. In last years appears all more
given in favour of participations of intracellular
infectious agents in genesis and rates of progressing
number of cardiovascular diseases. Purpose: To study
the presence of row the intracellular pathogens
infections beside the children with heart arrhythmias.
Methods: 52 children (20 boys and 32 girls) at the age
from 6 month to 16 years with different heart
arrhythmias were examined. All children the serological
diagnostics of specific antibody of class IgG to row of
infectious agents (herpes simplex virus,
cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, chlamydia
pneumoniae) was conducted; the DNA of this infectious
agents defined a method of polymerase chain reactions.
Results: The diagnostically significant subtitles of
antibody of class IgG to different intracellular pathogens
infections are discovered beside all examined children
with heart arrhythmias (100,0%). The DNA of the
intracellular pathogens infections took place in 40
(76,9%) children with heart arrhythmias, herewith
herpes simplex virus I type beside 23 (45,0%) patients,
Epstein-Barr virus – beside 16 (30,0%) children, the
association of Epstein-Barr virus and herpes simplex
virus I type – beside 13 (25,0%) examined patients.
Conclusions: The results of conducting studies are
indicative of intracellular pathogens infections in 100%
children with heart arrhythmias. The received data
allowed authors to suppose a probability of a heart
arrhythmias occurrence as a result of pathological
influence of intracellular infections. It is reason for
expansions of diagnostic complex with the purpose to
optimize of their treatment.

Department of Cardiology, University Children's
Hospital, Skopje, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Ventricular arrhythmias (VA)
in children are less common than supraventricular and
they are occurring more frequently after repairing of
congenital heart disease, especially of complex CHD.
The aim of the study is assessment of clinical features
and treatment of VA.
Methods: The used methods were: Clinical
examination, 12 channels electrocardiography, 2D
Doppler Collor echocardiography and Holter ECG.
Results: For the period of 10 year (1996-2005) we
found out VA in 48 pts, mean aged 8,7y +/- 2,4. Three
- 131 -
of pts had ventricular tachycardia (VT), the other 45
premature ventricular contraction (PVC) >= Lown class
III. All children with VT had symptoms, but in group of
children with PVC only 10 had a chest pain and
discomfort. Structurally normal heart had 17 pts,
secondary cardiomyopathia 2, Sy WPW 3, CHD after
repair 26 (T. Fallot 8, Atrial septal defect 7, ventricular
septal defect 5, transposition of the great arteries 4,
canalis atrioventricularis 1 and double outlet right
ventricle 1). Children with PVC were treated with
Amiodarone 25/45, Propafenon 12/45, and Propranolol
1/45; in a group with VT one child was treated with
Lidocaine and the other 2 with electrocardioversion.
PVC were successfully treated in 42/48 pts, 3/48 had
resistant PVC. VT was stopped and converted in sinus
rhythm in all three children. Later one child of them
died from chronic heart failure.
Conclusions: VA is very dangerous heart rhythm
disturbance especially in children with heart diseases.
For these reason they must be discovered at time and
treated to avoid sudden death.

Cardiac Intensive Care Department, Jo Ann Medical
Center, Tbilisi, Georgia
Background and Aims: During last years increased the
number of publications describing the efficacy of
Sildenafil in treatment of infants and children with
pulmonary hypertension (PH) of different etiologies. In
this regard we present two cases in which sildenafil was
used to treat acute PH in infants after CPB cardiac
surgery, as a last resort, instead of switching patient on
ECMO, for lack of iNO (only one iNO delivery system
is available in our facility and in both cases it was
occupied by another patient).
Methods: Two infants with VSD, 9 and 2 months old
(second one with Down syndrome) were presented after
cardiac surgery in which PH developed postoperatively
within 48 hours. Despite of hyperventilation, high FiO2,
deep sedation and I.V. nitroglycerin, PH persisted, after
approval of ethic committee and written consent of
parents, sildenafil 0,5 mg/kg every 6 hours via NG tube
was started. Systemic, pulmonary arterial pressures,
arterial pulsoximetry, ABG were measured during study
period.
Results: In one patient MPAP decreased by 51,3% after
40 min. and in second - by 42,7% after 120 min. of
sildenafil administration, without any changes of
systemic hemodynamics. Nitroglycerin was
discontinued after 24 hours of stability. Patients were
extubated on postoperative days VII and V, discharged
from hospital on days XII and XIV, respectively.
Conclusions: We discuss potential use of sildenafil for
treatment of PH after open heart surgery in infants,
particularly under circumstances where, due to limited
resources, iNO is not available. However, more research
is needed to establish efficacy of sildenafil.

Background and Aims: TAR- Syndrome is autosom-
recessive inherited disease, more often in girls. It is
manifested since birth with a group of symptoms
dominated by hypopplasio radii billateralis (100%),
more rare of ulnas in (20%). Very often this syndrome is
accompanied with CHD (ASD or TOF).
Thrombocytopenia dominated from the beginning and
presented anaemia is in correlation with haemorrhagic
diathesis. There are presented two girls with TAR-
syndromes from the same mother, but from two
marriages.
Methods: History, x-ray of extremitas, haematological
findings, echocardiography.
Results: History: In first marriage mother has one
healthy boy and one with TAR-syndrome verificated.
This girl has died when she was sixth months old of
intracranial haemorrhagic. First husband also died in
accident. In her second marriage mother has another girl
with morphology of TAR-syndrome. X-Ray of
extremitas: In both girls radius billateralis are absent and
second girl has also aplasio humeri billateralis. Lab:
Both girls has had haemorrhagic purpura since the
second month of life and extreme thrombocytopenia has
been registrated (30*10^9/L), haemostatic factors are in
order, anaemia is presented (Hgb-60g/L, HCT-o.18,
WBC-38*10^9/L). Echocardiography: First girl has
restrictive ASD, Cardiogram of both girls was regular.
Conclusions: Girls are from two different marriages in
different times (difference is five years) and for this fen
omen it has no explanation.

Background and Aims: Estimates suggests that the
22q11 deletion occurs in approximately 1 in 4000 live
births. The majority of patients have conotruncal
anomalies within DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial
syndrome and conotruncal anomaly face syndrome.
Microdeletion of chromosomal region 22q11 is
recognised by fluorescence in situ hybridization
technique. The aim of the study was to determine the
frequency of the 22q11 deletion in children with
conotruncal cardiac defects.
Methods: There were evaluated fifty children diagnosed
with conotruncal anomalies who were admitted to the
- 132 -
Department of Cardiology in the Third Pediatric Clinic,
Cluj-Napoca. Nine of them presented additional
extracardiac clinical features. Fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed to detect
22q11 deletion.
Results: The forms of congenital cardiac defects
included in the study were: tetralogy of Fallot in 28
patients (56%), transposition of great arteries in 10 cases
(20%), double outlet right ventricle in 8 children (16%)
and total anomalous pulmonary venous connection in 4
patients (8%). Additional extracardiac defects were
represented by narrow palpebral fissures, congenital
coloboma, velopharyngeal dysfunction, simian crease,
auricular anomalies, defects of the nasal pyramid,
mental delay, motor retardation and situs inversus. The
FISH test evidenced the 22q11 microdeletion in 9
patients (18%), 7 of them with additional extracardiac
anomalies.
Conclusions: The frequency of 22q11 deletion in
patients with conotruncal cardiac defects was of 18%,
the majority of these had additional extracardiac
anomalies, mainly facial defects.

Background and Aims: The 11q deletion disorder
(Jacobsen syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder with
variable phenotype (Grossfeld, P.D. et al. Am J Med
Genet A. 2004 Aug 15;129(1):51-61). Cardiac
anomalies has been described: mainly ventricular septal
defect (VSD) or left sided obstructive lesions. So far
pulmonary hypertension (PHT) has never been reported
in patients with Jacobsen syndrome.
Methods: Observational study (case report).
Results: Case report: a female patient with antenatal
suspected cardiac anomalies. Postnatally, ultrasound
revealed a ventricular and atrial septal defect while the
ductus arteriosus was still open. Other findings were
mild dysmorphic features, one-sided renal dysplasia and
thrombocytopenia. Chromosomal analysis showed
deletion of chromosome 11q. Cardiac catheterization at
age 3 weeks confirmed severe PHT (120 mmHg; aortic
pressure 70mmHg), restrictive VSD and ductus and no
aortic arch obstruction at that time. PHT was rapidly
progressive and did not respond to oxygen and nitric
oxide. Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
was instituted and additionally treatment with Sildenafil,
Bosentan and Prostacyclin was started. After 2 weeks
ECMO treatment was stopped. Due to anuria and weak
leg pulses an aortic arch gradient was suspected. Repeat
cardiac catheterization now revealed a hypoplastic
transverse arch with an important gradient. Emergency
balloon dilatation was attempted. Unfortunately, the
patient died of a profuse bleeding few hours after
balloon dilatation. Autopsy was not performed.
Conclusions: The finding of severe pulmonary
hypertension adds to the possibly lethal features in
Jacobsen syndrome, while aortic arch obstruction may
occur at an unusual level (transverse aorta).
THE MORPHOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF
HEART IN CHILDREN WITH CONGENITAL
HEART-DISEASES IN COMBINATION WITH A
INTRACELLULAR INFECTION

Department of Post-Diploma Education, Donetsk State
Medical University, Donetsk, Ukraine
Background and Aims: To study the morphological
structure of heart of children with congenital heart-
diseases (CHD), associated with a intracellular
infection.
Methods: 15 children (8 girls, 7 boys) from 5 month to
14 years with the different types of CHD (atrial septal
defect, ventricular septal defect, coarctation of the aorta,
patent ductus arteriosus, diseases of Fallot) were
inspected. Specific IgG to herpes simplex virus,
cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, chlamydia
pneumoniae, toxoplasma gondii were determined by the
method of enzyme immunoassay. A polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) to those exciters in the serum and
intraoperative bioptates of the tissues of heart was
conducted. The morphological study of intraoperative
bioptates of the tissues of heart was conducted by a light
microscopy.
Results: For all inspected children with CHD specific
IgG is discovered in diagnostically meaningful titles.
Thus in 7 (58,3%) cases found out IgG to the different
associations of the explored intracellular exciters.
Accordant to the data of PCR of serum, the DNA of the
explored exciters found out in 4 (26,7%) examined
patients, in intraoperative bioptate of endomyocardium –
in 3 (20,0%) children with CHD. At morphological
research of intraoperative bioptates of the tissues of
heart the signs of inflammatory changes were exposed
in 93,3% children. In 10 (66,7%) children displays of
acute inflammatory process took place. The markers of
the earlier inflammatory process – at 4 (26,7%)
examined patients.
Conclusions: Results testify that presence in the
organism of children with CHD persistence infections
can be accompanied with inflammatory changes in
tissues of heart.

Background and Aims: Prophylactic indomethacin
(pIND) is effective in reducing symptomatic PDA
- 133 -
(sPDA) requiring medical or surgical closure. Our aim
was (1) to determine whether the short term effects of
pIND were replicable in our population and (2) to
compare the likely effectiveness of 3 different strategies
for preventing or treating sPDA.
Methods: We reviewed case notes of babies with a birth
weight of <1250g treated with pIND. Information was
collected on the incidence of sPDA requiring a further
course of indomethacin and/or ductal ligation and these
rates were compared with previously reported rates of
sPDA. Three strategies of preventing or treating sPDA
in babies < 1250g were modelled using these data:
(1) prophylaxis; (2) symptomatic treatment and
(3) ‘selective’ prophylaxis of extremely preterm babies.
Results: During a 12 month period, 124 babies were
treated with pIND. The rate of sPDA (ie. failure rate of
pIND) was 16% and the incidence of ductal ligation was
4%. These figures are consistent with previously
reported data. For a hypothetical population of 100
babies < 1250 g, the table summarises potential benefits
against indomethacin exposure:
Conclusions: The short-term efficacy of prophylactic
indomethacin in our unselected population was similar
to that in previously reported trials. Targetting
prophylaxis at a higher risk population of extremely
preterm infants may allow reduced exposure to
indomethacin but risks increasing the number of ductal
ligations.

Background and Aims: Primary cardiac tumors are
rare, and myxomas constitute about 50% of primary
cardiac tumors in patients of all ages. Myxomas are
mostly localized in the left atrium (75%), and generally
friable, pedinculated, gelatinous benign tumors often
presents with cardiac obstruction and emboli. Here, we
report a case of myxoma localized in left ventricular free
wall caused syncope and cardiac arrest in a child.
Methods: An 11 years-old girl admitted to our hospital
cause of syncope, cardiac arrest, and following
consciousnesses. We learned that she was previously
healthy; after the beden e itimi lesson she had chest
pain and in the hospital she suddenly felt down with
cardiac arrest. After the cardiopulmonary resuscitation
she transported to our hospital while she was intubated.
We evaluated the patient, and echocardiography showed
an intracardiac pedinculated tumor localized in the left
ventricle free wall below the papillary muscle. The
tumor was totally resected by transmitral approach; it
was pathologically a simple myxoma. The child was
discharged after 5 days surgery without complication.
Conclusions: A very rare localization of myxoma, a
primary cardiac tumor, was presented because of
unusual clinical picture that ventricular fibrillation and
cardiac arrest. Cardiac tumors must be thought in such
clinical conditions.
THE ROLE OF ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY ON
EVALUATION OF THE SEVERITY OF MITRAL
REGURGITATION
M I Kelmendi, R H Bejiqi
Department of Cardiology, University Children's
Hospital, Prishtina, Kosova
Background and Aims: Echocardiography with
Doppler has recently emerged as the method of choice
for the non-invasive detection and evaluation of the
severity and etiology of valvular regurgitation. There are
many, qualitative and quantitative echocardiographic
parameters that can provide assessment of valvular
regurgitation.
Methods: A retrospective study of children with
rheumatic mitral regurgitation, examined at University
Children's Hospital, Prishtina. Following
recommendations of the American Society of
Echocardiography, six qualitative and quantitative
parameters are used for assessing mitral valve
regurgitation: regurgitant jet area, vena contracta, PISA,
pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary venous flow
pattern and left atrium size.
Results: There have been diagnosed 74 children with
rheumatic mitral regurgitation, 50 (67.5%) of them as a
pure mitral regurgitation and 24 (32.5%) combined with
aortic or tricuspid regurgitation. Using mentioned
criteria, the mitral regurgitation quantification has been
calculated as: mild in 36 pts (48.6%), moderate in 31
(41.9%) and severe regurgitation in 7 (9.4%).
Conclusions: The aproach to the evaluation of mitral
regurgitation severity ideally integrates multiple
parameters rather than depending on a single
measurement. this helps minimize the effects of
technical or measurement errors that are inherent to each
method previously discussed.

(PDA) is a frequent complication in the clinical course
of Very Low Birthweight Infants (VLBW). Our aim was
to evaluate PDA in preterm infants in our Neonatal

Methods: Retrospective review from data base of
inborn preterm infants (<33 weeks) admitted from
01/01/95 to 31/12/05. Diagnosis of PDA: 1) Birth
weight (BW) > 1000 gr., with clinical signs, confirmed
by echocardiography, 2) BW < 1000 gr., all had
echocardiography for diagnosis in the first 48-72 hours
of life. We analyzed epidemiologic data, clinical
features, echocardiographic findings, treatment and
outcome.
Results: Of 730 babies of < 33 weeks admitted into the
NICU, 148 had PDA (incidence 20.2%). 75 were male.
Mean BW: 933 +/- 256 g, gestational age: 27.2 +/- 2
weeks. Clinical features: 60/148 (40.5%) infants were
asymptomatic, 88 symptomatic: murmur 60/148
(40.5%), signs of congestive heart failure signs 21
(14%), other 7. Echocardiography: mean diameter PDA
2.14 +/- 0.7 mm, pulmonary hypertension 100 (67.5%).
Treatment: 128 (86%) indomethacin, 8 ibuprofen, ductal
closure achieved in 88 (68%) and 3 (37%) cases
respectively. 30 infants needed surgical ligation. 40
(31.2%) patients presented side effects after indometacin
(renal and digestive). Global mortality: 21.6%.
Conclusions: Incidence of PDA is high in preterm
infants. Clinical presentation is in most of the patients
either absent or mild. Early echocardiography diagnoses
half the cases, before clinical signs appear.
Indomethacin is the main treatment with an acceptable
rate of ductus closure, but frequent side effects.

Background and Aims: The benefit of nutritional
support in critically ill children gains growing
awareness, however assessment of the nutritional status
is not yet part of the routine admission. More recently
studies have emphasised the search for barriers to
adequate nutrition. The objectives are to assess the
nutritional status upon admission to the paediatric
intensive care unit (PICU), to evaluate the prescribed
and received calories during PICU stay and to identify
factors confounding the actual intake.
Methods: During the 4-month-study-period patients
with an expected PICU stay of 72 hours were
prospectively included. On admission anthropometric
measurements were performed. Daily calories
prescribed and actually delivered were recorded and
compared to estimated energy requirements (EER). The
reasons for decreasing the nutritional support were
registered in parallel.
Results: Fifty-two out of 298 patients (17.4%) were
included. Sixty percent (31/52) were acutely or
chronically malnourished according to the definition of
Waterlow. The median ratio of actual calories delivered
to EER was below 0.8 on day 3, 7, 14 and 21 in 68%,
17%, 13% and 7% of the cases, respectively. A
difference 5 cal/kg/day between prescribed and
delivered calories was observed in 231/589 of recorded
days (39%) for enteral nutrition (EN) and 0.1% for
parenteral nutrition. The decrease of EN was mainly due
to extubation, imaging studies and procedures.
Conclusions: Our study shows that despite a high
prevalence of malnutrition among the PICU population,
EER are not covered in a proportion of patients because
of ongoing interventions. We believe that specific
strategies may prevent this “procedure-induced” calorie
deficit.
DAILY ORAL SUPPLEMENTATION WITH L.
PARACASEI CNCM I-2116 LEADS TO A DOWN -
MODULATION OF MILK PROTEIN
HYPERSENSITIVITY IN MICE

A Mercenier
Department of Nutrition and Health, Nestlé Research
Center, Lausanne, Switzerland
Background and Aims: Cow’s milk allergy is one of
the leading causes of food allergy in children.
Sensitisation to milk proteins occurs early in life,
leading to atopic symptoms. Some clinical studies
showed that probiotic treatment of “at risk” infants
might prevent them from allergic symptoms, in
particular from atopic dermatitis. Here, we use a milk
hypersensitivity mouse model to evaluate beneficial
effect of the probiotic L. paracasei CNCM I-2116 on the
onset of atopic symptoms.
Methods: C3H/HeJ mice were sensitised 4 times with
whey proteins associated with cholera toxin, once a
week. All trial long, mice were receiving either L.
paracasei CNCM I-2116 (5.108cfu/mL) or
maltodextrine (matrix control) in drinking water. One
week after last sensitisation, mice were orally
challenged with b-lactoglobulin and symptoms
(scratching, puffiness and activity loss) were followed
for 45 min. At sacrifice, blood and faeces were collected
for seric IgE, IgG1, MMCP1, histamine and faecal IgA.
Faecal probiotic were recurrently counted during trial.
Results: Mice treated with maltodextrine showed a high
symptom score (4.1) compared to L. paracasei CNCM I-
2116 treated mice (1.3). This significant difference
could be correlated to a similar trend observed with
MMCP1, histamine, total IgE and specific IgG1 levels.
Conclusions: This preliminary data first indicates that
this experimental model is suitable to evaluate
preventive effect of probiotics in allergy. Secondly, this
study provides the evidence that probiotics can modulate
food hypersensitisation in mice. Indeed, we demonstrate
that daily administration of L. paracasei CNCM I-2116
protect mice from cow’s milk protein hypersensitivity.

O Amato, V Puricelli, S Montella, F Mosca
NICU, Clinica Mangiagalli (IRCCS), University of
Milan, Italy
Background and Aims: Body composition (BC)
assessment in premature infants is important for
nutritional support as protein intake influences body fat
retention. To examine postnatal changes in BC in
preterm compared to full term infants.
Methods: BC (%fat) was assessed using a new air
displacement system (PEA POD, LMI Concord, CA) in
19 Caucasian PT (mean GA 31 wks ± 2,4; mean BW
1332 g ± 370) and in 52 Caucasian FT exclusively
breast fed. In PT fat mass was evaluated at term adjusted
age, 1,2 and 3 months of corrected age and in FT within
72 hours of life, at 1,2 and 3 months. The
protein/100Kcal intake in PT up to term adjusted age:
3.1-2.7 g. Thereafter PT were fed standard formula.
Results: The mean fat of PT at term adjusted age was
higher than that of FT at birth (13.5%±3.6 vs
6.8%±3.94, p<.001). No significant difference was
found between mean fat of PT and FT at 1 (19.3%± 4.3
vs 17.2%±4.27), 2 (23.1%±2.3 vs 23.7%±3.9) and 3
months (24.6±4.1 vs 27.3%±4.03). Mean weight was
lower in PT at term adjusted age compared to FT at birth
(2577±281 vs 3236± 443,7 p<.001) and in PT compared
to FT assessed at 1 month. (3755± 501 vs 4359±622.5
p<.05).
Conclusions: Our data show that PT have fat mass at
term-adjusted age higher than FT at birth. Body weight
assessment does not provide information about BC.
High protein and energy intake could play an important
role in body fat retention in the first week of postnatal
life.
MARKERS OF INSULIN RESISTANCE
SYNDROME IN OBESE CHILDREN AND
ADOLESCENTS
E Papadopoulou, E Giahnakis, M Avanidi,
N M Fitrolaki, H Maniadaki, M Kalmanti
Department of Pediatrics, University of Crete,
Heraklion, Crete, Greece
Background and Aims: The prevalence of metabolic
syndrome (MS) or insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) is
high among obese children and adolescents, and
increases with worsening obesity. All or some of the
following characterizes the IRS: obesity, impaired
glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.
The use of hematological and non-hematological
markers to screen for IRS in this population remains a
necessity.
Methods: We reviewed data from 76 obese children,
including 33 females (43.4%) and 43 males (56.6%),
with a mean age of 10.3 years (range 3-16), who were
followed in our Childhood Obesity Clinic. BMI (kg/m²),
waist circumference (WC, in cm), fasting glucose (fG,
in mg/dL), fasting insulin (fI, in U/mL), HOMA-IR
index [Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin
Resistance =fI×fG/22.5], systolic and diastolic blood
pressure (BP), fasting triglycerides (fT, in mg/dL), and
atheromatic index (AI=total cholesterol/HDL) were
measured in every patient. Descriptive statistics and
difference of means of variables (independent samples T
test) were used. Correlations were considered as
significant at the 0.01 or 0.05 levels (2-tailed).
Results: A number of correlations between the markers
examined for IRS were observed: 1) fI is strongly
correlated with WC and BMI; 2) HOMA-IR is strongly
correlated with WC, fG, BMI, and fI; 3) Systolic and
diastolic BP are significantly correlated with WC, BMI,
fI and HOMA-IR. There was no a positive association
of fT and AI with the other markers of IRS.
Conclusions: Waist circumference may be a non-
invasive and low-cost marker of insulin resistance
syndrome, whereas fasting triglycerides and atheromatic
index probably cannot be used as early marker of this
syndrome.
THE EFFECT OF CHRONIC FETAL
UNDERNUTRITION AND HYPOXEMIA ON THE
FETAL RESPONSE TO ACUTE HYPOXIA
T Mulder, E Villamor, Z Gura, C E Blanco,
Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital
Maastricht, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: In most species fetal
glucocorticoid activity increases late in gestation and is
closely associated with maturational processes, essential
for postnatal survival. However, fetal exposure to excess
glucocorticoids is one mechanism suggested to
contribute to adult cardiovascular disease. Objective: To
describe the effect of chronic under nutrition and
hypoxia on fetal glucocorticoid levels in an mother
independent animal model.
Methods: Three groups of fertilised eggs of White
Leghorn chicken were incubated: 1) Chronic hypoxia
group: incubation in a hypoxic (15% O2) environment
2) Malnutrition group: incubation after removal of 10%
of the egg's albumin in a normoxemic environment
3) Control group: incubation in a normoxemic
environment without albumin removal. Plasma
corticosterone was measured in blood samples from the
chorio-allantoic artery. In each group 10 chick embryos
were measured at day 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 of
incubation (complete incubation time 21 days).
Results: Both chronic under nutrition and hypoxia
caused a significant reduction of embryo weight (E18:
24.6 g vs 20.5 g and 21.9 g respectively) with significant
sparing of the heart and brain weights. Control chicken
embryos showed an increase in corticosterone levels late
in incubation which was attenuated by chronic hypoxia
(25.9 nmol/l vs 15.3 nmol/l) but not by under nutrition.
Conclusions: Chronic hypoxia resulted in a reduced
surge for glucocorticoids. Chronic under nutrition had
no effect. This gives support to the hypothesis that
maternal glucocorticoids are responsible for the fetal
exposure to excess glucocorticoids in fetal growth
retardation.

Background and Aims: To develop a novel method for
the simultaneous determination of uric acid (a low-
molecular weight antioxidant) and of malondialdehyde
(MDA, indicator of lipid peroxidation) in reflex tears of
healthy and children with insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus (IDDM) by high performance capillary
electrophoresis.
Methods: Tear samples were collected with pre-
weighted strip filter papers, extracted with a low pH
phosphate buffer containing EDTA and were stored at -
70°C in the presence of 2,6-di-tetrabutyl-4-
methylphenol (BHT). Tears’ proteins were removed
after centrifugation through centricon-3 membranes.
Recovery values for all analytes were over 90%.
Analyte separation is achieved in a 25 mM borate
buffer, pH 10.0, containing 100 mM sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) at the temperature of 25 oC and 20 kV
(normal polarity). Reproducibility tests measuring both
migration times and peak areas gave low relative
standard deviation values. Calibration graphs were
linear and the detection limits, defined as a signal to
noise ratio of 3:1, were are 0.50, and 1.25 micromol for
uric acid and MDA, respectively.
Results: Preliminary results showed significantly lower
levels of uric acid in tears of diabetic children (median
5.27, range 1.28-27.02 micromol/L) than those of
healthy subjects (median 28.3, range 9.6-34.6
micromol/L). Levels of MDA in tears of diabetic
children (median 0.86, range 0-3.79 micromol/L) were
significantly higher compared to normal controls
(median 0.01 range 0-0.69 micromol/L).
Conclusions: The results suggest an increased oxidative
stress in tear film of children with IDDM which may
render them more susceptible to ocular surface
disorders.
PULMONARY STRETCH RECEPTOR ACTIVITY
RELATED TO THE ENERGY STORAGE OF
NORMAL AND SURFACTANT-DEPLETED
LUNGS DURING SPONTANEOUS BREATHING
R Sindelar, G Sedin, A Jonzon
Department of Women's and Children's Health,
University Children's Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden
Background and Aims: Vagal input from slowly
adapting pulmonary stretch receptors (PSRs) is
important for establishing regular breathing, normal
surfactant function and normal pulmonary gas exchange
at birth with the least work of breathing and without
overextending the lung. Our aim was to study the
response of PSRs to changes in energy storage of the
lungs under conditions encountered in newborn infants.
Methods: Single units of PSRs were recorded in seven
anaesthetised, spontaneously breathing young cats,
before and after lung lavage and then after surfactant
instillation. PSRs were classified as high threshold (HT)
and low threshold (LT) receptors. Instantaneous impulse
frequency (fimp) of PSRs was related to transpulmonary
pressure (Ptp), tidal volume (VT), and inspiratory time.
The PSR fimp was normalised (fN) to the energy
storage of the lung during inspiration (sigmadeltaP*V).
Results: Before lung lavage, all PSRs had the same fN
(0.41±0.03 impulses*s-1/L*kPa*10-4; ±S.E.M.), which
decreased after lung lavage (0.17±0.07 impulses*s-
1/L*kPa*10-4) and increased after surfactant instillation
to the pre-lavage level (0.45±0.12 impulses*s-
1/L*kPa*10-4; p<0.01, respectively). A high inverse
relationship between fN and inspiratory time was
observed for HT PSRs only, and was lost after lung
lavage and not re-established after surfactant instillation.
Conclusions: All PSRs responded similarly to the
energy storage of the lung in all lung conditions studied,
where more peripherally situated receptors (HT) were
sensitive to the rate of accumulated energy in normal
lungs only. Thus the lung protective and regulatory
function of PSRs might be related to the energy storage
of the lung.

Center, Nestec Ltd., Lausanne, Switzerland
Background and Aims: Epidemiological studies have
pointed to a role of the intestinal microbiota in atopic
diseases in infants. Increasing evidences suggest that
intake of some probiotic bacteria reduces risk of atopic
dermatitis (AD) in children. The NC/Nga mouse model
of AD has an environmental etiology, which probably
includes microbial stimuli. Thus representing an
appropriate model for testing potential efficacy of
dietary interventions. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the effect of a probiotic strain Lactobacillus
rhamnosus CGMCC1.3724 on the development of AD
in NC/Nga mice and document the potential underlying
mechanism.
Methods: Pregnant NC/Nga mice received either sterile
drinking water or water containing probiotics one week
before delivery and this treatment was maintained until
weaning. Weaning pups (n=10 per group) received
water containing or not probiotics. Pups were
transferred and kept into non-air controlled environment
until 12 weeks of age. Clinical skin severity scores,
scratching behavior, plasma concentrations of total IgE,
and IFN-g and IL-10 mRNA expression levels in dorsal
skin biopsies were examined in the two groups of pups.
- 137 -
Results: Oral administration of L. rhamnosus
CGMCC1.3724 was able to prevent the development of
high AD clinical scores. The scratching frequency was
also reduced. Plasma IgE levels were significantly lower
in the probiotic-supplemented group compared to
controls. Skin’s expression levels of IFN-g in probiotic-
supplemented mice were much higher than those of
control mice. IL-10 levels remained unchanged between
the two groups.
Conclusions: Continuous supplementation with L.
rhamnosus CGMCC1.3724 prevented the development
of AD in NC/Nga mice when given to pregnant mothers
and pups.

Hospital, University of Athens, Greece
Background and Aims: To monitor the rates of
exclusive breast feeding in Greek maternities and four
weeks after discharge, and to determine whether or not
supplementation in the hospital may alter to exclusive
breastfeeding once discharged.
Methods: We questioned 4310 Greek mothers from
seven representative hospitals on the fourth day in
maternity and postpartum. Odds ratios were calculated
to estimate the effects of health system, socio-
demographic, psychosocial and environmental factors
on the initiation of exclusive breast feeding and on the
possible change from partial and formula feeding in the
hospital to exclusive breast feeding at home, one month
after discharge.
Results: In maternities, the breast-feeding initiation rate
was 85%, whereas the rate of exclusive breast feeding
was only 23%. The initiation of exclusive breast feeding
was significantly positively associated with delivery at a
hospital with Baby-Friendly characteristics, early infant-
to-breast contact, rooming-in, vaginal delivery, young
maternal age, living in a less crowded home, high
education of paternal grandmother, previous experience
of breast feeding and delivery in autumn-winter. One
month postpartum the rate of breast feeding declined
slightly to 79%, whereas exclusive breast feeding rose to
61%. The strongest determinants for the above rise of
exclusive breastfeeding were lack of rooming-in and
previous breastfeeding experience. Women with no
experience were less likely to change to exclusive breast
feeding compared to primiparae.
Conclusions: The re-establishment of exclusive breast
feeding after hospital discharge suggests that hospital
practices have a reversible impact as women are capable
of overcoming a bad start in hospital.

Background and Aims: The aim of the study is to
determine if nutrition during the first month of life is
significantly associated with growth and/or pulmonary
function at 1 year of infants with bronchopulmonary
dysplasia (BPD).
Methods: Growth and pulmonary function at 1 year
were prospectively assessed for 27 preterm infants
(mean GA ± SD = 27.6±1.9wks; birth weight =
851±174g) with BPD (i.e., O2 requirement for more
than 28 days). Growth z-scores were calculated by using
the EuroGrowth Project growth curves. Functional
residual capacity (FRC) was assessed (n=27) with the
nitrogen washout method and the partial forced
expiratory flow (Vmax FRC) (n=23) with the jacket
method. Total energy and protein intakes during the first
5 weeks of life were determined from the medical chart.
Results: Height and weight z-score at 1 year were
significantly correlated with the first 2 weeks
cumulative protein intake (r=0.485, p=0.016) and 5
weeks energy intake (r=0.436, p=0.033), respectively.
FRC expressed as percent of predicted value, but not
Vmax FRC, was significantly correlated with the first 2
(r=0.447, p=0.029) and 5 weeks protein intake (r=0.445,
p=0.029). By using a stepwise regression model, which
included gender, birth weight z-score, postnatal age, and
in-utero growth, the first 2 and 5 weeks protein intake,
respectively, were the strongest predictors for height z-
score and FRC at 1 year.
Conclusions: In preterm infants with BPD, early protein
intake is significantly associated with catch-up growth
in length and pulmonary function at 1 year of age.

Background and Aims: To assess the influence of
different ventilatory modes on VCO2, VO2, and
respiratory quotient (RQ) using a new compact modular
metabolic monitor (M-COVX) and its impact on
measured resting energy expenditure (MEE).
Methods: The REE was measured at three different
modes of ventilation (PRVC, SIMV, BIVENT) and
compared to equations commonly used to predict resting
- 138 -
energy expenditure (REE) in mechanically ventilated
children.
Results: 103 pulmonary gas exchange measurements
were recorded using the M-COVX monitor at the three
ventilatory modes, sequentially. The patients were
sedated and/or paralyzed and in a stable condition. Each
measurement consisted of five consecutive 1-min
readings of VO2 and VCO2. MEE did not differ
significantly between PRVC (879±21 kcal/d), SIMV
(897±21 kcal/d), BIVENT (945±26 kcal/d). RQ
(.82±.01). and VCO2 (123±4 ml/min) were higher in the
BIVENT mode when compared to PRVC (.78±.01,
p=.002 and 102±2 ml/min, p<.0001, respectively). All
three modes displayed good agreement, and only energy
intake and temperature were independently associated
with MEE (p<.001). When paired differences between
equations and calorimetry were tested, Caldwell-
Kennedy equation showed the lowest mean MEE-REE
difference (-65±13 kcal/d, p<.0001) and Seashore and
Schofield equations exhibited the highest 95%
Confidence Interval of the Difference (-473.7 to -421
kcal/d and -307 to -226 kcal/d for upper and lower CI,
respectively, p<.0001).
Conclusions: The M-COVX is not influenced by the
different modes of ventilation in clinically stable,
adequately sedated critically ill children. None of the
commonly used equations is suitable to predict REE in
various modes of mechanical ventilation.

Background and Aims: Understanding the factors that
promote or prevent from breast feeding initiation in a
given society may substantially contribute to better
breastfeeding rates. The aim of this study was to assess
breast feeding rates in Crete, Greece and to identify
maternal and perinatal factors influencing the maternal
decision to breastfeed or not breastfeed.
Methods: A prospective cohort study using both a
questionnaire and follow-up telephone interviews.
Setting: Public and private maternity wards of
Heraklion, Crete, Greece. A sample of 1,049 mothers in
early parturition was interviewed during their stay in the
maternity ward. Investigated variables included
demographics, family size, past breast feeding
experience, social support, tobacco use and presence of
complications during pregnancy and labor.
Results: Of the 1049 participants, 942 (89.7%) intended
to breastfeed their infants. Of these 942 mothers, 619
(65.7%) were still breastfeeding at month 1 post-partum
but only 161 (17.1%) were still breastfeeding at month 6
post-partum. Maternal factors negatively affecting
breast feeding initiation were indigenous vs. immigrant
mothers (p<0.05), advanced age (p<0.05), caesarean
section (p<0.05), lack of breastfeeding experience
(p<0.0001) and tobacco use (p<0.001). Infant-related
factors negatively affecting breast feeding initiation
were prematurity (p<0.005), admission to neonatal ward
(p<0.0001) and male gender (p<=0.05).
Conclusions: Our results suggest that several of the
factors negatively affecting breastfeeding initiation rates
are liable to early intervention and prevention. Health
professionals involved in perinatal medicine share a
considerable part of responsibility for the low
breastfeeding rates.

Background and Aims: Leptin is a hormone excreting
from adipose tissue and bound to hypothalamus. Leptin
is implicated in appetite control, temperature up-
regulation and energy expenditure. Our study’s aim was
to determine the impact of feeding on leptin secretion in
a population of preterm neonates.
Methods: Leptin study was a prospective one, enrolling
87 preterms born at the hospital. Ethics Committee
Approval and parental informed consent were obtained.
Eligible neonates were all preterms (<37 weeks of
gestation, according to Dubowitz criteria). All neonates
were fed within 4-6 hours after birth the same volume
according to weight and day. For example on day 1 they
received 30 ml/kg with an increment of 30 ml/kg/per
day till maximum 250 ml/kg/per day. Neonates were fed
the same formula and breast fed infants were excluded
as well as those with respiratory distress, birth injury,
vomiting, diarrhea, necrotising enterocolitis. Blood
sampling during the first 6 hours of life and repeated
sampling on day 26 of feeding for serial leptin
measurements.
Results: 87 neonates mean gestational age 34.13 (SD:
1.04), mean birth weight 2047.73 gr (SD: 217.15) were
enrolled in the study. 87 were sampled on day 1 of life
and 76 on day 16. Mean leptin value on day 1 was 2.44
pmol (SD: 5.845), and on day 16 mean leptin value was
1.477 pmol (SD: 1.240). T-test for paired samples gave
statistic difference in 95% confidence interval with (2-
tail significance: 0.029) on leptin value between day 1
and 16.
Conclusions: Leptin is greatly influenced by food
augmentation in preterm infants.
ANTIOXIDANT AND PEROXIDE CONTENT OF
MILK FROM MOTHERS WHO DELIVERED AT
TERM AND PRETERM NEWBORN INFANTS
D Turoli, M Condo', R Zanini, R Bellu'
NICU, Ospedale 'Manzoni', Lecco, Italy
Background and Aims: Evidence indicates that source
of oxidants can be a challenge to the immature
antioxidant defenses of the newborn infant and that
human milk contains many antioxidant considered to
- 139 -
prevent diseases mediated by oxygen free radicals in
very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. In previous
studies we investigated human and formula milk
antioxidant and peroxide load. In the present study we
investigated antioxidant and peroxide load of preterm vs
term human milk.
Methods: We measured with spectrophotometric
methods the lipid peroxides (LPOx), conjugated diene
(CD) and T-BARS (pro-oxidants) and the total
antioxidant activity (TAA) content of 26 milk samples,
10 from mothers who delivered at term newborns and 16
from mothers who delivered preterm (24-32 weeks
gestational age) newborns. Mean values and standard
deviations were calculated and analyzed by Student's
t-test.
Results: Results are shown in table. No significant
differences were noted between term and preterm
human milk.
Conclusions: Milk from mothers who delivered term or
preterm did not show any significant differences as
regard to total antioxidant content and peroxide load,
thus indicating similar resistance to oxidative stress.
These in vivo data agree with in vitro studies (Friel JK,
Pediatr Res 2002).

Background and Aims: Microcirculation is impaired in
sepsis. The non-invasive spectroscopic device
Mediscan-2000 detects changes in CR earlier than
clinical capillary refill time in sepsis. It measures total
haemoglobin in capillaries using a probe with a short
pathlength. In term newborns measurement of
central/peripheral temperature gradient helps
recognising sepsis. The axilla is useful for core
temperature monitoring in afebrile neonates. Aim was to
assess the value of axillary and central/peripheral
temperature measurements in ELBW newborns in
comparison to CR measured by Mediscan-2000 in
sepsis.
Methods: Axillary, abdominal skin and shin
temperatures were recorded when bloods taken for
sepsis. Within 2h spectroscopic measurement of CR was
performed at the forearm using a defined pressure
stimulation. Time between end of pressure stimulation
and resulting peak of CR was calculated. Infants served
as their own controls without sepsis. Results are given
as median.
Results: 10 septic ELBW newborns (27 weeks, 990g)
were recruited. CR increased from 4.5s without sepsis to
6s during sepsis (p=0.017). No significant change in
axillary, skin or shin temperatures and skin-shin
gradient. Axillary-shin or skin-shin gradients were
equally significantly different (p=0.005) with and
without sepsis. CR correlated significantly with each
other (r=0.67, p=0.035) during both periods. No
significant correlations of the temperatures and/or
gradients except for axillary and abdominal skin
temperature during sepsis (r=0.85, p=0.002).
Conclusions: ELBW newborns have central/peripheral
temperature differences that do not vary with sepsis
despite changes in microcirculation suggesting an
incomplete temperature control mechanism. Axillary
and abdominal skin temperature and skin-shin gradient
are not helpful detecting sepsis.

Background and Aims: Describe postnatal growth of
preterm very low birth weight infants (VLBWI).
Evaluate the impact of prenatal growth, maturity, acute
and chronic illness in postnatal growth.
Methods: Retrospective analysis of VLBWI with
gestational age (GA) under 33 weeks born at a single
institution between 2002 and 2005. Growth was
evaluated at birth, 28 days of postnatal life and 36 weeks
of postconceptional age. Acute illness was defined as
the need of mechanical ventilation for more than three
days (MV), high frequency ventilation (HFV) or late
sepsis. Chronic illness was defined as
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Prenatal growth
was evaluated by Z score at birth. We defined small for
gestational age (SGA) as birth weight (BW) under 10
percentil (Alexander curves). Statistical analysis was
performed using SPSS.
Results: 472 newborns were included. BW was
1072,6±252 grams and GA 28,7±2,2weeks. 18,8% were
SGA. 61,5% needed MV; 21% HFV; 27,2% had late
sepsis and 17,2% BPD. oAll infants had lower Z scores
at 36 weeks than at birth. Difference of Z score between
birth and 36 weeks was higher in babies under 29 GA.
Acute, chronic illness and SGA favours postnatal
undernutrition (PU). In multivariant logistic analysis,
birth weight Z score protected against PU (OR 0, 16);
lower GA (OR=4,3), need of HFV (OR=3,1) and BPD
(OR=4,3) increased the risk of PU.
Conclusions: oPU is universal in VLBWI. oIn utero
growth protect against PU. Inmaturity, acute and chronic
illness are risk factors for PU. oAll infants should be
monitored specially those with higher risk.

Background and Aims: Little is known about thyroid
function in obese adolescents. A possible relationship
between thyroid function and adipose tissue metabolism
in human has been suggested. To examine the
relationship between thyroid hormones and body mass
index. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out
in Lar province and its' vicinity in south of Iran. By
stepwise random sampling from all public girls' high
schools, 227 subjects (aged 12 - 21) were selected.
Serum samples were collected and assayed for
Triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), thyroid
stimulating hormone (TSH), reverse triiodothyronine
(rT3), free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3).
Weight and height were measured and body mass index
(BMI) were calculated (weight / height²). Subgroup
analysis was done according to body mass index.
Results: TSH and rT3 were correlated with BMI
(r = 0.66, P = 0.001 and r = 0.65, P = 0.001
respectively). Adolescent girls with BMI >25 kg/m²
showed higher serum TSH and rT3 than subjects with
BMI < 25 kg/m² (P=0.001). Conclusions: Our data
showed that, although thyroid function was normal in
the studied subjects, TSH and rT3 were positively
correlated to BMI. TSH and rT3 could present a marker
of altered energy balance in overweight and obese
adolescent girls.

Background and Aims: The gut hormone peptide YY
(PYY) 3-36, one of the two main isoforms of PYY, has
been suggested to posses an antiorexigenic action in
animals and human adults. However, its circulating
levels and function have not been studied in neonates.
The aim of this study was to determine the circulating
concentrations of PYY3-36 in preterm and full term
infants and to examine their correlations with the
infants' anthropometric characteristics, food intake,
growth rates and the circulating levels of hormones
involved in the regulation of metabolism, total PYY,
ghrelin, leptin, insulin and adiponectin.
Methods: Serum levels of the above mentioned
hormones were measured by RIA in 62 preterm infants
(gestational age 32.0±2.1 weeks, postnatal age
40.9±14.8 days) and 15 full term infants of a
comparable postnatal age. All the infants were formula-
fed on demand.
Results: PYY3-36 concentrations were significantly
higher in preterm (543.7±157.6 ng/L) than full term
infants (350.9 ± 114.1 ng/L, p<0.001). PYY3-36
accounted for 48% and 42% of total PYY basal plasma
immunoreactivity in preterm and full term infants,
respectively, and correlated negatively with the infants'
BMI and positively with serum ghrelin concentrations in
preterm and full term infants. There was no significant
correlation between PYY3-36 and caloric intake, weight
gain or any of the other hormones studied.
Conclusions: PYY3-36 accounts for a high percentage
of total PYY immunoreactivity in neonates, similarly to
adults. Along with the orexigenic peptide ghrelin it
seems to play a central role in the regulation of
metabolism; however, its specific functions and
physiologic significance in neonates remain to be
elucidated.

Background and Aims: The optimal timing of
clamping the umbilical cord in preterm infants at birth is
the subject of continuing debate. New studies were
published since the last systematic review on the effects
of a brief delay in cord clamping time on the outcome of
babies born prematurely was published and a new
review is warranted.
Methods: Retrospective meta-analysis of randomised
trials in preterm infants. Data collected from published
studies systematically searched and analysed according
to the rules and regulations of the Cochrane
collaboration. Inclusion: All infants born below 37
weeks gestation and enrolled into randomised trials of
delayed cord clamping versus immediate cord clamping
after birth.
Results: Ten studies describing a total of 454 preterm
infants were identified which met the inclusion and
assessment criteria. Major benefits of the intervention
were higher circulating blood volume during the first 24
hours of life, less need for blood transfusions (p =
0.004) and less incidence of intraventricular
haemorrhage (p = 0.002).
Conclusions: The procedure of a delayed cord clamping
time of at least 30 seconds is safe to use and does not
compromise the preterm infant in the initial post partum
adaptation phase. It should be introduced as a routine
procedure.

Background and Aims: This study aimed at analyzing
host and donor-derived hematopoiesis of mixed
chimeras, created by prenatal bone marrow
transplantation (PBMT), without the influence of
cytoablation and immunosuppression.
Methods: Gestational day 14 FVB/N (H-2Kq) fetuses
were transplanted with C57BL/6 (H-2Kb) marrow cells
at a dose of 5-10x106. Recipients with chimerism levels
>10%, at 1 month old, were examined monthly for
donor-derived CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45R, CD11b and
Gr1 cells.
Results: Ten high-level chimeras were enrolled (Fig a).
The levels of different lineage antigens didn’t fluctuate
over 6 months except for significantly lower levels of
CD8+ (P=0.004) and CD45R+ cells (P=0.002) at month
1 (Fig b). Apart from CD45R (P=0.003), all lineage
antigens displayed steady fractions of donor-derived
cells within 6 months (Fig c). In donor-cell population,
CD11b+ (P=0.001) and Gr1+ (P<0.001) cells showed
significantly higher expression, reciprocally with lower
expression of CD3+ (P=0.002) and CD8+ (P<0.001)
cells, at month 1 than at later time-points (Fig d).
Conclusions: Successful engraftment by PBMT started
as higher expression of donor myeloid cells and
disproportionate domination of donor B-cells. Overall,
lymphoid reconstitution was superior to myeloid
reconstitution, mirroring the clinical success of PBMT
only in diseases with lymphoid but not myeloid defects.

Background and Aims: Several cases reports in the
literature brought to discussion the distinction criteria
between fetus in fetu and teratoma. It has been
suggested that considerable overlap exist between the
two conditions, making sometimes their distinction a
complex task.
Methods: We present a clinical case of a boy, born at
34 weeks, evaluated for a capsulated abdominal mass
with left uretero-hydronephrosis, diagnosed at the
31st week.
Results: He was only son of young, healthy, non-
consanguineous parents. Pregnancy complicated with
gestational diabetes. Birth by caesarean section,
APGAR 5/8/8, adequate anthropometry for gestational
age. A post-natal CT scan showed an expansive
retroperitoneal lesion, from kidneys to pelvis, sacro and
coccyx, with solid, cystic and fatty areas; aspirative
biopsy was inconclusive; he underwent surgery on day 9
with partial resection of the lesion; it revealed a 33g,
6x4x4cm fragment with a broken capsule, cystic and
solid components, with mature neuro-epithelial
(encephalic, choroidal plexus, ependyma), adipose and
foetal epithelial tissues; no immature tissue found. A
new procedure to remove the remaining, 8 months later,
resulted in a 133g, 9x8x5 cm mass, partially capsulated,
yellowish, with small cavities fulfilled with brown
material; mature tissues, with organized components of
nervous system, respiratory and digestive apparatus,
liver pancreas, thymus, nervous ganglia, skin and
adnexa, musculoskeletal and brown adipose tissues;
cartilage and several focus of calcification.
Conclusions: This case presents features of both
teratoma and fetus in fetu. The assumption of one of the
diagnosis has prognostic implications, with resulting
differences in clinical follow up and expectations about
the child's future health.

Background and Aims: Chylothorax is an
accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the pleural space and
commonly develops after cardio-thoracic surgery or
secondary to thrombosis and/or high pressure in the
superior vena cava. Antithrombin (AT) is the most
important natural inhibitor of the coagulation cascade.
While inherited deficiency of AT is rare in the general
population, acquired deficiency is frequently observed
in patients with liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, and
after major surgery, particularly cardiac surgery. The
study determines whether increased AT loss is present
in newborn and children with chylothorax after cardiac
surgery.
Methods: The plasma and pleural effusion samples of
children with chylothorax and with non-chylous pleural
effusion were assayed for AT activity. Chylous samples
were collected on day 2 to 4 postoperatively when
chylothorax diagnosis was confirmed.
Results: Ten children with chylothorax and five
children with non-chylous pleural effusion were
- 142 -
investigated. Mean antithrombin activity was
statistically significant increased in chylous samples
(32.2±11.4%) compared to non-chylous samples
(14.4±13.9), and significantly decreased in plasma of
children with chylothorax (44.6±15.4%) compared to
children with non-chylous pleural effusion
(69.9±22.4%). Seven of ten children with chylous and
none of the children without chylous developed
thrombosis (p<0.007).
Conclusions: Increased loss of AT is present in children
with chylothorax, potentially predisposing these
children to an increased risk of thrombosis. Thus,
repeated AT substitution on a regular base should be
considered in critically ill children with chylothorax.

Background and Aims: To study the fecal level of
calprotectin in relation to mode of delivery and feeding,
both factors reported to influence type of bacterial gut
colonization and thus potentially also the granulocyte
reponse.
Methods: We measured fecal calprotectin values in spot
samples of faeces from 244 infants at age 4, 10, 30 and
120 days. Wilcoxon signed rank test and Mann-Whitney
U Test were used for comparisons.
Results: Calprotectin levels increased from day 4 to day
30 in all infants (p= 0.007), followed by a significant
decrease by day 120 (p<0.001). The formula fed infants
had lower calprotectin levels at day 30 than those
breastfed (p=0.01), and the initial rise in calprotectin
level from day 4-10 was lower in the infants delivered
by C-section compared to those delivered vaginally
(p=0.009), also when stratified according to mode of
feeding (p=0.022). A stratified analysis among the
infants delivered by C-section demonstrated a lower
fecal calprotectin average between day 10 and 30 in the
formula versus breast fed group (p= 0.013). An effect of
formula feeding in the infants delivered vaginally
(7/160) could not be calculated because of too small
numbers included so far.
Conclusions: The initial increase in calprotectin level
has previously been reported and may reflect increased
migration of neutrophile granulocytes into the gut lumen
as an early immunologic adaption to the first bacterial
colonization. The levels though seem influenced both by
mode of delivery and feeding, possibly due to associated
differences in the bacterial colonization of the gut and
the resulting innate immune response.

Background and Aims: Cellular immunity plays a
crucial role in the cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection,
and substantial populations of CMV-specific T cells
accumulate throughout life. However, although CMV
infection occurs during childhood, little is know about
the quality of T cell responses in pediatric populations.
Methods: We screened a large Japanese population
(1036 individuals) and analysed the CD8+ T cell
responses to CMV, comparing these to responses in
children, young and elderly adults. The frequencies,
phenotype and function CD8+ T cells for two
immunodominant epitopes from pp65 were measured
cross-sectionally.
Results: We observed consistently high frequency and
phenotypically 'mature' (CD27 low, CD28 low,
CD45RA+) CMV-specific CD8+ T cell responses in
children, including those studied in the first year of life.
These CD8+ T cells retained functionality across all age
groups, and showed evidence of memory 'inflation' at a
population level through adult life.
Conclusions: CMV consistently elicits a very strong
CD8+ T cell response in infants and large pools of CMV
specific CD8+ T cells are maintained throughout
childhood. The presence of CMV may considerably
mould the CD8+ T cell compartment over time, but the
relative frequencies of CMV-specific cells do not show
evidence of a population-level increase during
childhood and young adulthood. This contrasts with the
marked expansion ('inflation') of such CD8+ T cells in
older adults. The strong and sustained responses to
CMV observed in children suggest that vaccine
strategies aiming to elicit protective CD8+ T cell
responses to major pathogens (such as HIV, HCV,
malaria or CMV itself) might be successful in younger
children.

Background and Aims: Annexin V is a phospholipid-
binding glycoprotein with anticoagulant activity. It is
expressed by trophoblast cells and its preferential
binding substrate is phosphatidylserine. As the gamete is
fertilized, the trophoblast expresses phosphatidylserine
for binding to the endometrial surface. In the normal
embryo, annexin V binds to phosphatidylserine as a
- 143 -
protective anticoagulant mechanism. In women with
recurrent fetal losses, placental annexin V is decreased.
We have conducted a study on the prevalence of serum
anti-annexin V antibodies in relation to pregnancy
failures in women with and without the history of fetal
losses and/or premature births.
Methods: We have screened serum samples of 13
women (29.7 +/- 2.3 years of age) with no antecedent of
thromboembolic or autoimmune diseases but manifest
recurrent pregnancy losses and/or premature births; 14
serum samples of women (33.7 +/- 4.2 years) with
sterility but without history of fetal losses; and serum
samples of 14 women (38.4 +/- 7.3 years) with SLE and
no coincidental history of reproductive failure. IgG and
IgM anti-annexin V, anti-cardiolipin, anti-
phosphatidylserine and anti-ethanolamine antibodies
were determined in all serum samples, with no
awareness of the outcome of pregnancies.
Results: Patients with pregnancy losses and/or
premature births showed significantly increased levels
of IgG anti-annexin V antibodies as compared to the
patients without miscarriages/premature deliveries
(p=0.005). Neither IgG/IgM anti-cardiolipin, beta-2-
glycoprotein-1, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidy-
lethanolamine levels nor IgM anti-annexin levels were
significantly different between the groups.
Conclusions: Anti-Annexin V antibodies were the only
ones significantly associated with child losses.

Budapest, Hungary
Background and Aims: In the last 15 years Hungarian
children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) were
treated according to the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster
(BFM) German protocols. Aim of the present study was
to summarize our experience with these protocols, to
assess the survival rates and to compare the Hungarian
data with the international results.
Methods: Between 1990 and 2004 230 children,
diagnosed with NHL were treated according to BFM
protocols in Hungary. The male-to-female ratio was
2.59 : 1, the mean age at the time of diagnosis was 10
years and 1 month.
Results: Among the 230 children, 28 (12%) had stage I
disease, 65 (28%) stage II, 92 (40%) stage III and 45
(20%) stage IV. Ninety-one children had non-B, 108 B-
NHL and 31 anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).
Twenty-eight patients had relapse after a mean time of
13 months from the time of the initial diagnosis. In the
over mentioned period, 16 children underwent
autologous stem-cell transplantation. Nine patients with
B-NHL got anti-CD-20 immunotherapy. Five year
overall survival (OS) of our patients is 78%±3%, event-
free survival (EFS) is 75%±3%, the mean follow-up
time of 6 years. The 5-year OS and EFS rates were not
statistical different in the three histology groups (OS:
72%±5%, 83%±4% and 80%±7% in non-B-, B-NHL
and ALCL; EFS: 69%±5%, 81%±4% and 74%±8% in
non-B-, B-NHL and ALCL).
Conclusions: NHL has quite good prognosis among the
malignant pediatric diseases. The Hungarian results are
comparable with other international data. In the last five
years the OS is about 10 percent better than it was
before.

Medical University, Lodz,
Poland
Background and Aims: It is still unclear what the best
re-immunization strategy for children recovered from
ALL is. Recently, the loss of humoral immunity to viral
antigens has been described, suggesting the need for
revaccinating patients. This study aimed to evaluate
serological and immunological status in children
recovered fom ALL.
Methods: The study involved 30 children aged 5 to 17,
after chemotherapy which ended from 12 months to 5
years before. Before the leukaemia was diagnosed all of
them had been immunized according to Polish National
Immunization Program. We analyzed levels of serum
antibodies against 3 polio viruses, measles, mumps and
rubella by enzyme immunoassays. IgG, IgA, IgM serum
concentrations and some parameters of cell mediated
immunity were determined. Non-immune children were
given boosters and revaccination responses were
studied.
Results: (1) Approximately 70% of investigated
children did not have a protective level of antibodies
against 3 polio viruses, 80% did not show protective
level against measles despite immunization before ALL
diagnosis. (2) Analysis of post re-immunization
response showed high percentage of children with
protective level of antibodies: for polio 1 and 2-100%,
polio 3-90%, measles and mumps 87%, rubella 100%.
Conclusions: (1) No significant impairment of humoral
and cell mediated immunity as a possible
contraindication for the use of attenuated vaccine was
found. (2) Our finding of loss in antibodies in children
treated with chemotherapy suggests that reimmunization
is necessary after the treatment is completed. Children
recovered from ALL should be vaccinated according to
individual immunization schedule based on the results
of serological and immunological testing.

Background and Aims: Consumption coagulopathy
(CC) is characterized by the abnormally regulated
activation of procoagulant pathways resulting in
decreased levels of hemostatic components. Here, we
tested the hypothesis of a subclinical CC status in high-
risk infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit
(NICU) who subsequently developed hemorrhage (H).
Methods: A total of 88, consecutively admitted,
newborns (gestation: 32.9 ± 3.93 wk; birthweight:
1927 ± 835 g), were screened for coagulation. The
coagulation screening panel, performed < 1st hour after
birth, included: prothrombin time (PT), International
Normalized Ratio (INR), activated partial
thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, proteins C and
S, antithrombin III (AT3), D-dimers (D-D), and platelet
(PLT) counts. Absolute values were converted into
multiple of medians (MoMs) for gestational age.
Hematocrit (Hct) was also recorded.
Results: H occurred in 14 (15.9%) cases at a mean time
of 1.5 ±0.77 days from admission, with severe life-
threatening bleeding in 4 cases (4.5% of the total; 28%
of the bleeding group). Development of H was
associated with a significantly prolonged aPTT (3.0
MoMs, 95% CI: 1.63-3.0 vs. 0.49 MoMs, 95% CI: 0.43-
0.56, p<0.0001) and high frequency of
thrombocytopenia (PLT<150,000/mmc) at the time of
admission (28.6% vs. 1.3%, p=0.0007). Gestational age,
birth weight, gender ratio, PT, INR, AT3, D-D, proteins
C and S, and initial Hct were comparable between
groups (p>0.22).
Conclusions: These findings suggest that
(i) development of H is significantly associated with
early laboratory signs of asymptomatic compensated
CC; and (ii) the combination of aPTT and platelet
counts could provide a first level screening to identify
the condition.

Children's Hospital, Skopje, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Idiopathic pulmonary
hemosiderosis (IPH) is uncommon in children. A triad
of hemoptysis, iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and diffuse
pulmonary infiltrates characterized pulmonary
hemosiderosis.
Methods: The subject of this study were 43 patients
with IPH diagnosed from 1969 to 2005 at the
Hematology-Oncology department, Pediatric clinic in
Skopje. Statistical analysis was performed.
Results: Mean age at diagnosis was 6±3,64 years, the
gender distribution was almost equal. At diagnosis all
patients had anemia and pulmonary infiltrates, 26
(60,4%) had dyspnea, 10 (23,2%) had tachycardia, 5
(11,6%) had hemoptysis, and 16 (37,2%) had icterus.
The level of hemoglobin was usually between 40-70
gr/l. The diagnosis was based on history, presence of
anemia and characteristic chest x-ray, and was
confirmed by showing macrophages laden with
hemosiderin in gastric washings or bronchoalveolar
lavage. The initial treatment consisted of prednisone in
40 patients (93%). Ten patients (23,2%) required long-
term corticosteroids because of recurrent attacks and 17
patients (39,5%) required other immunosuppressants
(imuran or leuceran) in addition to prednisone to control
their hemoptysis. Eight patients (18,6%) died of acute
massive pulmonary hemorrhage, 3 patients have been
cured (with long-term follow up of 22,25 and 30 years
and being without treatment of 18,11 and 19 years
respectively). Five-year survival for IPH patients in our
study was 80% (by Kaplan Meier method).
Conclusions: Sudden decrease in hemoglobin and
hematocrit associated with the onset of active
respiratory disease is strongly suggestive of IPH.
Hemosiderin laden macrophages are diagnostic for IPH.
Early and long-term immunosuppressive therapy may
improve the prognosis.

Background and Aims: Identification of iron
deficiency (ID) is essential to prompt early treatment to
prevent long-term systemic complications, including
cognitive impairment in children. Reticulocyte
haemoglobin content (CHr) provides a real time
assessment of erythropoietic activity. The diagnostic
efficiency of CHr was investigated for the detection of
ID in a pediatric population using five different cutoff
levels of biochemical markers.
Methods: A descriptive transversal study of an urban
population aged 6 months to 14 years-old with risk
factors for ID or ID anemia was carried out. Levels of
red blood cell indices, CHr, serum ferritin, trasferrin
saturation, transferrin, serum iron and total iron binding
capacity were measured.
Results: Samples were obtained for 237 children (mean
age 63.7 months, male:female ratio 1.08:1). ID and ID
anemia mean prevalence was 17% and 5%, respectively.
A multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis
identified CHr as the best multivariate predictor of iron
deficiency. Each unit increase in CHr lowered the risk
of iron deficiency by 63% (1 – OR). A CHr cutoff value
of 25 pg had a sensitivity of 86%, 88.8% and 97.4% and
a specificity of 81.4%, 81.4% and 77.6% for the
diagnosis of ID, ID with or without anemia and ID
anemia, respectively.
- 145 -
Conclusions: A CHr level of less than 25 pg was the
strongest predictor of ID and ID anemia. Our study
supports that a panel based exclusively on hematologic
indices including CHr is a valid alternative to the
traditional biochemical panel for the diagnosis of ID
with or without anemia in children.

Background and Aims: Iron deficiency anemia is a
prevalent health problem world wide. We aimed to
assess if health education programme could be used
with exiting health resources to reduce the incidence of
IDA in a population in high risk.
Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study. A
total of 310 recorded on the child health computer
registers were participated. Children were recruited at
one month age and randomized into control and
intervention groups. Families in the intervention group
received specific health education information at two six
and eight month age by face to face contact, giving
information on iron and iron deficiency anemia and their
prevention and dietary health education. The control
group received standard health education as delivered by
nurses in the well baby clinic. Hemoglobin, ferriten,
MCV and iron estimation and the estimation of the diet
at one year age were also performed. The data analyzed
by EP info using X2 test for analyzing different groups.
Results: A total of 287 children completed the study.
Fifty four (38%) of the control group and forty two
(29%) of the intervention group were anemic as defined
by hemoglobin less than 11gr/dl (P value: N.S). NO
significant difference was found in the values of ferritin,
MCV and hemoglobin in the two groups. There was no
difference in the iron content of the diet offered to the
two groups of children.
Conclusions: Effective prevention strategies are needed
and further research is warranted.
CORD BLOOD IGE (CB-IGE) LEVELS AND THE
DEVELOPMENT OF ALLERGY DURING THE
FIRST YEAR OF LIFE

Clinical Hospital MSWiA, Warsaw, Poland
Background and Aims: It is crucial to have a method
for selecting high risk infants and preventing atopic
disorders. Probably essential significance has a CB-IgE.
The goals of this study were: Appreciation whether CB
tIgE and sIgE predicts the development of atopic
diseases in early infancy and analyze the factors
affecting on CB-IgE.
Methods: 207 randomized term neonates were being
included in a prospective cohort study, 173 responses
were obtained. Total and specific (for children’s food,
wheat/grass and HDM) CB-IgE levels were determined
using the immunoassay test. The cohort was observed
prospectively for 12 months and we performed
questionnaires (after birth, in 6 and 12 month).
Results: CB-IgE level was between 0,0-23,08 IU/ml
(mean 0,549 IU/ml). We detected sIgE in 34 newborns
(40 positive tests). 42% of the infants had atopic
symptoms. The major disease was atopic dermatitis
(36,4%). The hazard for developing atopy symptoms
was higher in boys, children with family history of
atopy and passive tobacco smoke exposure. The
pregnant complications, caesarean section and early
eggs intake increased risk for onset atopy diseases.
Exclusive breast-feeding was protective factor. The
male gender, the pregnant complication and number of
sibling increased total CB-IgE levels. No correlation
was seen between family history of atopy, parental
smoking and CB-IgE.
Conclusions: There is no correlation between total and
specific CB-IgE levels and presence of atopic
symptoms. Total and specific CB-IgE level with atopy
family history cannot be used as the indicators for
selecting high risk of infants. The best method for
selecting high risk infants is precise medical history.

Background and Aims: To evaluate the clinical
characteristics, treatment regimens, and outcome of the
patients with Hodgkin’s disease.
Methods: 614 patients diagnosed with Hodgkin’s
disease between 1972 and 2006 were retrospectively
evaluated. All patients were treated with chemotherapy
with/o radiotherapy. Chemotherapeutic regimens
included COPP derivatives (cyclophosphamide or
mustargen + oncovin + prednisolone + procarbazine),
ABVD (Adriamycin + Bleomycin + Dacarbazine +
Vinblastine), or alternated ABVD/COPP. Staging was
done according to Ann Arbor classification system and
histopathologic examination was done according to Rye
system. Mean and median values were used for the
demographic characteristics. Kaplan-Meier survival
curves were used for survival analysis. The patient
groups were compared in terms of survival duration
using a log-rank test.
Results: There were 452 males and 162 females with a
median age of 8 years (2 to 21). 183 patients had B
symptoms. Stage distributions were 165, 185, 145, and
119 patients in stage I, II, III, and IV, respectively.
Histopathologic subtypes were mixed cellularity,
nodular sclerosis, lymphocytic predominance,
lymphocytic depletion, and unclassified in 344, 90, 62,
- 146 -
46, 71 patients, respectively. Overall (OS), and event-
free survival (EFS) rates in whole group were 83 and
60%. OS rates were 79%, 95.6%, 91.8% in regimens of
COPP (n=402), ABVD (n=94), and alternated
ABVD/COPP (n=65) (p=0.02). The other significant
prognostic factors on survival were stage (p=0.0001), B
symptoms (p=0.0001), and age (p=0.01).
Conclusions: This is one of the largest series in a single
center. ABVD regimen has the best survival rates and
should be used for treatment of patients with Hodgkin’s
disease.

Background and Aims: The immunoregulatory
abnormalities, including abnormal cytokine production,
are thought to be important in the pathogenesis of JIA.
However, the key mediators have not yet been
elucidated. To determine the serum and synovial fluid
levels of IL-18 in patients with JIA, and to explore the
association of those levels with the status and activity of
disease.
Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 81
children with JIA (31 with oligoarticular, 33 with
polyarticular and 17 with systemic JIA). Synovial fluid
samples were collected from 16 children with
pauciarticular JIA. Concentrations of IL-18 were
determined using commercial kits
Results: Patients with systemic JIA had higher serum
levels of IL-18 than patients with other forms of JIA or
control children, both during the active (median, range:
6240, 1600 – 78750 pg/mL) and inactive (1615, 513 –
3270 pg/mL) phase of disease (ANOVA, P<0.05).
Levels of IL-18 in sera of children with pauciarticular
JIA (255, 89 – 4342 pg/mL) were similar to the
corresponding synovial fluid levels (217, 89 – 1245
pg/mL). Serum levels of IL-18 were proportional to the
ESR and CRP, but inversely proportional to the
haemoglobin levels.
Conclusions: As IL-18 appears to be an important
mediator of systemic JIA, its inhibition might be a base
for a successful therapeutic approach.

Background and Aims: The thalassemias, a group of
inherited disorders of hemoglobin synthesis. This
disease was regarded as very rare in Poland. The aim of
the present investigation was to investigate thalassemia
in children who had been referred to a Hematological
Clinic in Warsaw for hypochromic anemia.
Methods: 25 children (14 male and 11 female), aged
1- 17 years (average 7.7 years) with microcytic anemia,
who had unsuccessfully been treated by family doctors
with ferrous were examined for thalassemia. Levels of
iron, ferritin, TIBC, transferrin saturation, bilirubin
hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) and hemoglobin F (HbF) were
evaluated. Family blood count was also evaluated.
Results: Average hemoglobin level was 11.15g/dl
(9.2-11.8g/dl) and erythrocyte count was 5.52mln/mm3
(5.65-6.3 mln/mm3). Average mean cell volume
(MCV - 63.5 fl /55-75 fl/) and mean cell hemoglobin
(MCH - 20.25 fl /55-75 fl/) were below normal. Average
MCHC, RDW, iron, ferritin and bilirubin levels were
normal. HbA2 had increased in 8 children and HbF in 3
children. There was an increase in both HbA2 and HbF
in 10 children. In three children genotypes confirmed
the presence of mutations. Thalassemia was detected
in one of the children (M.G.) and thalassemia ß in
another. No clinical symptoms of thalassemia were
found in any of the children. In 11 adult relations similar
deviations were observed in blood count (low Hb, MCV
and hight RBC level). Thalassemia had not been
diagnosed in these people earlier.
Conclusions: Thalassemia should be considered in
differential diagnosis of children with microcytic
anemia in Poland.

Amaliada, Greece
Background and Aims: It is well known that the
number of platelets is related to many factors including
infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
effects of bronchiolitis on platelets.
Methods: The admitted patients diagnosed with
bronchiolitis and had at least one complete blood count
(CBC) performed from the same Coulter analyzer were
included in this study. The CBC, the sedimentation rate
(SR) and the clinical characteristics such as age and
days of hospitalization, were recorded.
Results: From 116 patients studied, 63.8% had
thrombocytosis (platelet number >500x 103cells/mm3).
The mean platelet number (Plt) was 452±154
x103cells/mm3. The patients had mean SR 24 ± 17
mm/h, mean white blood count (WBC) 10.9 ± 4
x103cells/mm3 and mean hemoglobin (Hb) 11.3 ± 1.6
gr/dl. The Plt had positive linear relationship with the
patients’ age (R2=0.210, p<0.0001) and the SR
((R2=0.167, p<0.0001). However, negative linear
relationship was shown between the Plt and the Hb
- 147 -
(R2=0.183, p<0.0001). Statistical significant differences
were reported comparing the Plt of the patients with
high SR (>50mm/h) and low SR (<50mm/h) (p=0.009)
and the patients with high WBC (>15 x103cells/mm3)
and low WBC (<15 x103cells/mm3), (p=0.001).
Interestingly, significant difference was shown
comparing the SR value of the patients with high Plt
(>500x103cells/mm3) and low Plt
(< 500x103cells/mm3), (p=0.0001).
Conclusions: Thrombocytosis is a very common
finding in patients with bronchiolitis. The age of the
patient and the degree of inflammation are affecting the
platelet number.

Background and Aims: Predictions of intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIG) unresponsiveness in Kawasaki
disease (KD) are difficult. The aim of this study was to
establish predictive models of being an IVIG
nonresponder. Methods: We reviewed clinical records
of 546 consecutive KD patients (development data set).
A predictive model was estimated from multiple logistic
regression analysis and additional validation was
performed on an independent dataset of 204 consecutive
KD patients (validation data set). To increase the
usefulness of this risk stratification in clinical practice,
we approximated it with a simple scoring model where
integer score points were assigned to each variable.
Results: A seven variable logistic model was
constructed, including day of illness at initial treatment,
age in months, percentage of white blood cells
representing neutrophils, platelet count, and serum
aspartate aminotransferase, sodium, and C-reactive
protein, that generated an area under the receiver-
operating-characteristics curve of 0.84 and 0.90 for the
development and validation data sets, respectively.
Using both data sets, the seven variables were used to
generate a simple scoring model that gave an area under
the receiver-operating-characteristics curve of 0.85. For
a cutoff of 0.15 or more in the logistic regression model
and 4 points or more in the simple scoring model,
sensitivity and specificity were 86% and 67% in the
logistic model; and 86% and 68% in the simple scoring
model. The kappa statistic is 0.67, indicating good
agreement between logistic and simple scoring models.
Conclusions: Our predictive models showed high
sensitivity and specificity in identifying IVIG
unresponsiveness among KD patients.

Background and Aims: Respiratory syncytial virus is a
major cause of viral bronchiolitis during infancy. Host
response is important for disease susceptibility and
severity but not yet fully elucidated. Methods: To study
this response we used microarray to measure mRNA
gene expression in whole blood of five male infants
hospitalised with RSV, subtype B, bronchiolitis versus
five one year old male controls exposed to RSV during
infancy without bronchiolitis. Gene expression levels
were further evaluated in a quantitative real-time PCR
study with TaqMan Low Density Array cards in an
extended population of 18 infants hospitalised with this
disease. Results: Among the 30 genes most
differentially expressed by microarray nearly 50% were
involved in immunological processes. Among these
were the upregulated interferon stimulated genes IFI27,
IFI44, EIF2AK2, IFI44L, OAS3 and G1P2 and the
downregulated genes CLC, HLA-DQA1 and HLA-
DRB4 (tab). When performing PCR on some of these
genes IFI27 was upregulated in all but one infant, and
CLC was downregulated in all 18 infants. Conclusions:
IFI27 is upregulated and CLC is downregulated in
whole blood of infants hospitalised with RSV, subtype
B, bronchiolitis when compared with one year old
controls exposed to RSV without bronchiolitis during
infancy.

Merck Research Laboratories, West Point, PA, USA
Background and Aims: Measles, mumps, rubella, and
varicella are serious viral diseases worldwide. A
combination vaccine, ProQuad®, was developed for
their prevention.
Methods: 5446 children, 12-23 months, received a
single dose of ProQuad® in 4 clinical studies. A subset
of 1035 children received a second dose of ProQuad®
~3 months later. M-M-R®II and VARIVAX® were
provided as control. Serum was obtained prior to and 6
weeks after each vaccination and antigens were
evaluated by ELISA or gpELISA. Safety was evaluated
for 6 weeks postvaccination.
Results: The rate of seroconversion ( 1.25 gpELISA
units/mL) to varicella was 97.9% and 99.5% after one
and two doses, respectively. Titers 5 gpELISA
units/mL generally correlate with protection against
varicella disease; the rate was 91.2% and 99.4% after
one and two doses, respectively. Responses to measles,
mumps, and rubella were 97.4% after one and two
doses. The response rates to all 4 antigens after a single
dose of ProQuad® were similar to those after M-M-
R®II and VARIVAX®. The proportion of subjects with
at least one adverse experience (AE) was comparable
between ProQuad® recipients and recipients of M M
R®II and VARIVAX®. The most commonly reported
vaccine-related systemic AEs after ProQuad® were
fever, irritability, measles-like rash and varicella-like
rash. Fever was transient without long-term sequelae.
The AE incidence following a second dose was
generally lower than following the first dose.
Conclusions: ProQuad® is generally well tolerated and
highly immunogenic for measles, mumps, rubella, and
varicella following one and two doses, at levels which
have been shown to correlate with protection.

Background and Aims: Congenital infection with
Toxoplasma gondii is mainly subclinical, it initially
goes unnoticed, but if it is untreated, babies can later
develop sequelae. Until now, postnatal diagnosis was
made by the detection of specific antibodies,
nevertheless transplacentally acquired maternal IgG can
interfere at this level and neonatal IgM or IgA
production can be largely variable. Furthermore, current
diagnostic methods are not sufficiently sensitive and
frequently fail to establish the diagnosis before one year
of age: tests for IgM and IgA antibodies identify up to
75% infected babies. The aim of our study was to
evaluate the specific cellular immunity to T. gondii
antigens in newborns with different immunological
assays, in order to provide an accurate diagnosis of
congenital infection as early as possible.
Methods: We tested IFN-g production, T lymphocyte
proliferation and the expression of activation antigens
CD25 and HLA-DR on T lymphocyte membrane on
infected and non infected neonates at different ages.
Results: All the employed assays showed good
sensitivity and specificity with the cut-off values defined
in the study. Furthermore, immunological tests let us
find 2/9 infected neonates which were negative with
serological tests before three months of age. Moreover,
we observed that specific T lymphocyte response
increased with age in treated infected neonates,
suggesting that therapy does not affect lymphocyte
activity.
Conclusions: Our results confirm the usefulness of
cellular immunity evaluation in association with
serological investigations for an early diagnosis of
congenital toxoplasmosis.

Background and Aims: Tuberculosis remains a leading
cause of death from any single infectious disease
accounting for over a quarter of all avoidable deaths.
Children with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI)
represent the future reservoir from which adult cases
will arise. This study aims to describe the incidence and
to investigate the usefulness of tuberculin skin test
(TST) for diagnosis of LTBI among internationally
adopted children of our area.
Methods: TST reaction size was recorded for 100
school aged internationally adopted children ranging in
age from 6 to 14 years old. Two groups of children were
identified: First group (A) consisted of 54 children that
were born in Greece and weren't BCG immunized and
the second group (B) included 46 children who were
born in a TB endemic country, had at least one foreign
parent and were BCG immunized at birth.
Results: The mean age of children was 7.1 years. In 44
(81.4%) children of group A and 30 (65.2%) of group B
was found induration 5mm. In 22% of children of both
groups was confirmed LTBI. Chest radiography was
done for all children with induration of 15mm or more
and for BCG- immunized children with induration
- 149 -
10mm. None of our patients was found to have active
TB disease.
Conclusions: The result indicates that the use of TST in
the diagnosis of LTBI may not be affected by BCG
vaccination at birth. The prevalence of latent
tuberculosis infection among internationally adopted
children is high and warrants an expansion of contact
investigation. TB prevention strategy targeting children
of foreign origin is imperative.

Background and Aims: The recent wide application of
the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7-PCV)
has contributed in the prevention of invasive
pneumococcal disease. And in certain countries is
recommended for all children under 2 years of age. The
schedule for 7-PCV is 4 doses if started under 7 months
of age but older children need less doses. This study is
designed to evaluate the quantitative response of the
antibody against Pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide,
before and after the administration of 7-PCV in children
1-4 years old and the correlation of the results with age
and dose regimen.
Methods: Blood was drawn from 22 Greek children
before and 3-4 weeks after the administration of 7-PCV.
The children were classified in two age groups: A:6
children 12-23 months and B:16 children 2-4 years old.
Group A received two 7-PCV doses, while Group B
received one dose of the vaccine. Pneumococcal
anticapsular antibodies (anti-PCP) were measured in
serum by an enzyme immunoassay (ELISA). Antibody
response to 7-PCV was estimated using an antibody
increase factor (IF) which was calculated as follows:
IF=anti-PCPafter7-PCV/anti-PCPbefore 7-PCV.
Results: Group A children had significantly higher IF
score compared to the older children (P=0.008). A
3–fold increase in antibody levels was observed in 4/6
(66,7%) and 3/16 (18,75%) Group A and B respectively.
Conclusions: The administration of two 7-PCV doses
results in satisfactory anti-PCP levels in children of
12-23 months of age. In older children, the antibody
response to the administration of one 7-PCV dose was
not considered to be satisfactory. Further studies will
support the need or not for a booster dose in older
children.

Background and Aims: CMV is the most frequent
cause of congenital infections. Prematurity itself brings
immunodeficiency due to immaturity of immune system
that can facilitate infection process. Moreover, CMV
infection can further compromise the immune system of
premature infants. To assess changes of humoral and
cellular immunity parameters in infants with congenital
and early postnatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
To use the results as a tool for better timing of
vaccination in premature infants.
Methods: Assessment of humoral and cellular
immunity parameters - IgG, IgA, IgM levels, T and B
lymphocytes, NK cells, T lymphocytes subpopulations,
T lymphocytes transformation after mitogen stimulation
- in a group of infants with congenital or early acquired
postnatal CMV infection at 1 year of corrected age.
Results are compared with age specific normal values.
The intensity of urine CMV shedding served as marker
of the CMV infection activity. The examination was
made from treatment reasons in the sake of patients, not
for study reasons.
Results: 10 children with active CMV infection were
examined. Hypoimmunoglobulinemia IgA was found in
all cases, combined IgG and IgA in 2 and IgG, IgA and
IgM in 4 cases. The results of cellular immunity
examination show dysregulation rather than deficiency.
The intensity of virus urine shedding was very high in
patients with organ involvement.
Conclusions: Infants with congenital or early postnatal
CMV infection can have compromised immunity. The
immunity assessment and the intensity of virus shedding
can be a useful tool for the proper timing of vaccination
with vivid vaccines especially in premature infants.

Department of Immunology, Clinic for Children’s
Diseases, Skopje, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Haemophilus Influenzae is one
of the most important bacterial agents of upper
respiratory tract infections, and one of the main causes
of severe invasive bacterial disease in children under 6
years of age. With introduction of conjugated
polisaharide Hib vaccine, protection from this serious
agent is achieved. The aim was to protect our
immunodeficient patients or patients with suspected
immunodeficiency suffering of frequent upper
respiratory tract infections caused with Haemophilus
Influenzae type b with Hib vaccine, because regular
immunization against this agent in our country is not
introduced yet.
Methods: On the Department of Immunology at the
Clinic for Children`s Disease in Skopje, 67 patients,
aged from 1 to 5 years, were immunized with
- 150 -
conjugated Hib vaccines. They were followed up during
the next 24 hours, and then, every 3 months in the next
two years.
Results: There were not adverse post vaccine reactions
during the first 24 hours or later. During the next two
years, Haemophilus Influenzae type b was not isolated,
neither in nose nor oropharynx and no one case of Hib
disease had appear, except in one case, when after one
year of immunization, Haemophilus Influenzae type b
was found again in upper respiratory tract, but without
Hib disease manifested.
Conclusions: Immunization with conjugated Hib
vaccine of our patients came out as safe and effective,
resulting decreased morbidity connected with Hib
disease. Immunization with conjugated Hib vaccine in
all our immunodeficient patients is necessary, as well as
introduction of this Hib vaccine in regular program for
immunization in our country.

Background and Aims: Diagnosis of toxic shock
syndrome (TSS) is based on clinical criteria. It has
similarities with diseases that are mediated by toxins,
both from the clinical and the immunological points of
view. Proinflammatory cytokines play a role in the
pathogenics, similar to what occurs in Kawasaki's
disease (KD), which is also diagnosed clinically.
Methods: A four-year-old girl with high fever,
vomiting, abdominalgia, and headache for 48 hours, was
referred to our hospital. She presented conjunctival
hyperemia without secretion, very hyperemic oral
mucosa, dry cracking lips and palmoplantar erythema.
On admission temperature was 39 C, heart rate 145
bpm, and blood pressure 95/60 mmHg. She had not
urinated since the night before admission.
Results: Laboratory tests showed: leucocytosis,
thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular
coagulation, high plasma C-reactive protein level and
elevated ESR. Renal and hepatic study was normal.
Creatine kinase levels and antistreptolysin-O titres were
normal. Blood, urinary and cerebrospinal fluid cultures
were negative. Echocardiograph was normal. The
rheumatic disease study was negative. Needed intensive
care and was administered dopamine, cefotaxima and
teicoplanina, intravenous immunoglobulins and aspirin.
Remained feverish and with periungueal desquamation.
The polymorphous skin rash eased in one week.
Favorable evolution, presenting generalized skin
desquamation at 2 weeks.
Conclusions: Our patient was diagnosed with TSS and
was treated aggressively. Given the diagnostic doubt
about atypical KD endovenous gammaglobulins were
administered, due to the higher cardiological risk and
because children with TSS can benefit from its
administration. Similarities with syndromes triggered by
bacterial antigens make differential diagnosis very
difficult on occasions.

Background and Aims: The endothelium of blood
vessels has important role in forming of immunological
response, its modulation and regulation. The
immunological response has manifestation of vasculitis,
purpura, etc. Our aim is to present 'the path' of our
patient to the final diagnosis and all differential
diagnostic problems.
Methods: Our patient was 11 months male baby,
extremely upset, with high temperature and enlarged-
swollen neck noduli lymphatici. He has been
ambulatory treated with antibiotics for seven days
without any results. The second day after hospitalization
exanthema rash showed up all over the body. The
treatment with anti allergic therapy showed no results,
too. Punction of the neck noduli lymphatici was realized
without any suppuration – it eliminated neck’s
phlegmona. The consultation with ORL specialist and
infectiologist from Clinical center- Skopje didn’t give
final diagnosis. The baby was transported to the Clinic
of Pediatrics in Skopje in difficult condition. Several
diagnoses have lead us to diagnosis of M. Kawasaki.
Results: The treatment with immunoglobulin and
aspirin has shown the first positive results.
Conclusions: M. Kawasaki was noticed for the first
time in Japan 1967 with unknown etiology. The patient
was male baby less than 5 years. The provocation factor
is staphylococcus endotoxin B. Complete clinical
investigation is necessary for determining the final
diagnosis of the immunological response of the
endothelium and realization of the necessary therapy.

Background and Aims: Typical cat-scratch disease
(CSD) is a self limiting infectious disease present with
lymphadenopathy in a patient with a history of cat
contact. Cases of bone involvement in patients with cat-
scratch disease are rare.
Methods: We describe a case of a 11 year old boy with
prolonged fever, inguinal lyphadenitis and osteomyelitis
after being scratched by a kitten.
- 151 -
Results: The physical examination revealed enlarged
lymph node in right inguinal. Serum titer for Bartonella
henselae was positive (IgM 80, IgG 1024). Scintigraphy
revealed a pathological focus of 8th rib and right parietal
bone. MRI of the skeletal bone revealed pathological
changes of 8th vertebra with associated rib and changes
on the right iliac bone. After observing MRI signs of
bone lesion a combination of rifampicin and
azithromycin in period of 6 weeks was given.
Conclusions: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the
best methods for osteomyelitis providing detailed
anatomical information especially in vertebral and
pelvis osteomyelitis. Our case confirms reports that MRI
has an excellent diagnostic accuracy and is more reliable
for the detection and evaluation of the bone lesions of
CSD osteomyelitis than scintigraphy and computerised
tomography.

Background and Aims: Infective mononucleosis is a
viral disease caused by EBV (Epstein-Barr virus). It is
characterised with changes of lymphocyte in fact
monocyte segment and clinical expression of higher
body temperature, tonsylopharingitis and an
enlargement of lymphatic glands, splenogalis, and
appear of atypic lymphocyte in the peripheral blood.
EBV is lymphocytropic toward B-lymphocytes which
are in same time receptors C3d components of
complements. The injection of EBV in the epitel cells
and B-lymphocytes is by tonsils and Waldeyers ring in
oropharings. When the virus is in B-lymphocytes, it can
cause cytolysis in those cells (sometimes this infection
is missing - when the DNA virus is build in the infected
genome of infected B-lymphocytes.
Methods: Laboratory tests, atypic lymphocyte and
monocyte, specific reactions, evident disease, materials
from clinic for children disease - Hematooncology,
Childrens Hospital - Bukurest/Skopje (Macedonia).
Results: With aim to get a complete knowledge of
expansion of this type of illness from October until
December, which have been already written: of 137 sick
people, from the age of 0-4 years are 39, and from 11-15
years old are 98 infected.
Conclusions: Bad economical environment is a cause
for appearance of subclinical form of infective
mononucleosis in the early age of life, and also among
the puberty population.

Background and Aims: Coronary sequelae that persist
after Kawasaki disease (KD) have been associated with
obstructive changes of coronary blood vessels in
adolescents and young adults. However, little is known
about the association between sequelae late after KD
and inflammatory markers, which are potential
mediators and markers for atherogenesis. The aim of our
study to evaluate the prognostic role of CRP as an
inflammatory marker in patients with KD as regards late
cardiac complications.
Methods: Retrospective study was performed to test the
hypothesis that coronary sequelae are associated with
elevated levels of inflammatory markers especially CRP
in patients after KD (3 and 6 months). Levels of high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) was reviewed 53
patients diagnosed as classical KD and divided into 3
groups according to the coronary artery lesions (CALs):
KD patients without CALs (n=40); KD with regressed
CALs (n= 8); and KD with persistent CALs, such as
persistent aneurysms, stenosis, and occlusion (n=5).
Results: CRP levels were significantly elevated in a KD
group with persistent CALs compared with other KD
groups. Regression analyses supported the association
between the coronary artery lesions and elevated level
of CRP.
Conclusions: The persistence of coronary lesions after
KD was independently associated with elevated level of
CRP suggesting that inflammation may be a novel
functional aspect of coronary artery diseases late after
KD.

Korinthos, Korinthos, Greece
Background and Aims: Immunization is an effective
strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality among
children. The objective of the study is to determine the
vaccination status among gipsy children of our region.
Methods: The study was carried out to assess the
vaccination coverage by comprehensive analysis of
routinely collected child immunization cards of gipsy
outpatients ranging in age from 2 months to 14 years
old, who were admitted to the emergency paediatric
department of our hospital for the period 2003-2005.
The sample consisted of 425 children (203 males and
222 females).
Results: Complete age-appropriate vaccination
coverage for all vaccines recommended by the National
Immunisation Program was 21%. Immunization
coverage (three doses) was 55% for diphtheria-
pertussis- tetanus, 58.7% for poliomyelitis, 35% for
Haemophilus influenza and 61.3% for hepatitis B and
42.8% for first dose measles- rubella- mumps.
Immunization coverage was 88% for measles (one dose)
and 46.8% for tuberculosis.
Conclusions: A high proportion of gipsy children of all
ages did not have an age appropriate vaccination status.
- 152 -
The immunization coverage is too low to prevent
epidemics in our region. Targeted parental education
and timely vaccination strategies would be of essential
value for individual and community protection against
common preventable diseases.
AUDIT OF CENTRAL LINE INFECTIONS ON
PICU

PICU, Alder Hey Hospital, Liverpool, 2
PICU,
Birmingham Children's Hospital, Birmingham, UK
Background and Aims: A working party had been
formed in a tertiary children’s hospital to look at the
management of central venous lines. Information on
positive cultures was available from the microbiology
department. However there was a lack of denominator
information i.e. number of lines inserted, type of lines,
average duration of placement, reasons for removal etc.
An audit was undertaken on PICU to address some of
these issues.
Methods: Information on the patients, line and infection
data was collected over a 2 months period (11/04-01/05)
on all PICU patients who had a central venous line
during their stay. Data continued to be collected until
the line was removed.
Results: More than half of the 124 line episodes were in
cardiac patients, 16% of all patients were
immunocompromised. 1/3rd of the lines inserted were
heparinised. Nearly 60% of the lines were placed into
the internal jugular veins, 35% into the femoral veins.
2/3rds of the lines were in situ for less than 7 days, 15
lines were removed because of suspected infection. Of
these only 5 were the source of the infection. However
on routine cultures of line tips 1/3rd were colonised
significantly without causing clinical concern.
Conclusions: Our audit did not show significant
microbiological differences in the type of central line
used (heparinised versus non-heparinised), site of
insertion nor how long the line was in situ. The high rate
of significant colonisation without clinical correlate led
to the recommendation to suspend the routine
microbiological work-up of the line tips.

Background and Aims: Community-acquired
pneumonia (CAP) is a frequent cause of children's
hospitalization. Few studies have systematically
analyzed the presence of viruses in children with CAP,
main objective of this work.
Methods: Prospective study in children between 1-36
months of age diagnosed with CAP (clinical and
radiology) that required emergency attention between
october-1-2004/september-30-2005. Inhaled naso-
pharynx virus influenza A/B, RSV, Parainfluenza,
Adenovirus, Metapneumovirus (hMPV), Coronavirus
and Rhinovirus presence were investigated by means of
cell culture and/or polymerase chain reaction.
Results: 241 children presented CAP. 77 cases were not
included because of partial data and/or paternal non
consent. The 164 included cases (91 male children and
72 female children), had an average age of 19.7 months
(2-36 months) and 50 cases (30%) were under 12
months. Viruses were identified in 104 cases (63%), 37
in children under 12 months (74%) and 67 in children
above 12 months (59%) (p=0.06). The most frequent
virus was the rhinovirus with 27 cases (25,9%) followed
by RSV (24%) and other virus (33.6%). Coinfections
were found in 17 patients (16.3%). 85/164 children were
admitted (58 infected with virus), 8 of them to the PICU
ward. A virus was found in 26 out of 34 who needed
oxygen therapy (76%) (the most frequent RSV, n=8).
There were no deaths.
Conclusions: Viruses are frequently detected in
children under 3 years with CAP, being Rhinovirus and
RSV the most prevalent. The results suggest that the
viruses are cause or cofactors in most of the cases of
CAP among children.

Background and Aims: To determine if preterm birth
alters socioeconomic status, psychological functioning
and health related quality of life (HRQoL) in adulthood.
Methods: Prospective follow-up of 192 adult offspring
whose mothers took part in a randomised controlled trial
of antenatal betamethasone for the prevention of
neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (66 born at term,
126 born preterm). Cognitive functioning was assessed
using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence.
Working memory and attention was assessed using the
Benton Visual Retention Test, the Paced Auditory Serial
Addition Test and the Brown Attention Deficit Disorder
Scale. Psychiatric morbidity was assessed using the
Beck Depression Inventory II, the State-Trait Anxiety
Inventory and the Schizotypy Traits Questionnaire.
Handedness was assessed using the Edinburgh
Handedness Inventory. HRQoL was assessed using the
Short Form 36 Health Survey.
Results: Moderate prematurity (median gestation 34
weeks, mean birth weight 1,946g) did not alter later
marital status, educational attainment, socioeconomic
status, cognitive functioning, working memory,
attention, or symptoms of anxiety or schizotypy at
thirty-one years of age. Prematurity was associated with
fewer symptoms of depression and higher levels of
satisfaction in three of the eight HRQoL domains
measured (bodily pain, general health perception and
social functioning).
- 153 -
Conclusions: Adults who were born moderately
preterm have socioeconomic status, psychological
functioning and HRQoL consistent with those who were
born at term. This good long-term outcome cannot be
extrapolated to those with early childhood disability or
very low birth weights.

University College London, UK
Background and Aims: The cognitive outcome of
preterm children with perinatal brain injury is still
poorly understood. Injury often involves periventricular
white matter tracts, which are essential for speech and
language functions. The study aimed to carry out a
comprehensive assessment of speech, language and
literacy abilities in preterm children aged 10-16 years
with perinatal brain injury, and investigate associations
with structural and functional imaging findings.
Methods: A cross sectional study of a cohort of children
born <33 weeks gestation treated at a single tertiary
neonatal unit. Children with unilateral or bilateral
lesions on neonatal cranial ultrasound were eligible for
inclusion in the study. Outcome was assessed using
standardised tests of auditory processing (SCAN-A),
speech (VMPAC, GFTA) and language functions
including tests of grammar (TROG-2), expressive and
receptive language (CELF-3 UK, EOWPVT,
ROWPVT), and phonological (CTOPP) and literacy
(WORD) abilities. Neuroimaging included conventional
structural MRI (T1, T2 weighted sequences) for visual
assessment of lesions, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
for assessment of white matter integrity, and functional
MRI (fMRI) to determine language lateralisation and
reorganisation.
Results: Preliminary data in ten cases demonstrated a
wide range of language skills from low to high levels of
functioning, and normal speech outcome in the absence
of a relationship to standard neuroradiological findings.
Conclusions: There is variability in the profile of
language abilities in pre-term children with perinatal
brain injury, which does not appear to be associated
with findings on conventional structural MRI. However,
it is expected that quantitative DTI measures will be
more sensitive to white matter injury.

Background and Aims: The aim of this study was to
investigate white matter (WM) abnormalities in a cohort
of extremely low gestational age infants (ELGA
<27+0w) born in Stockholm 2004-2006.
Methods: 61 infants underwent magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI, Philips Intera 1.5T) at term-equivalent
age and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI, 6 diffusion
directions) data of high quality was acquired in 32
infants with mean gestational age (GA) 25+3w (23+5-
26+6). Four regions of interest were chosen: The genu
and the splenium of corpus callosum, the posterior limb
of the internal capsule (PLIC) and the total WM at the
level of centrum semiovale. Apparent Diffusion
Coefficient (ADC) and Fractional Anisotropy (FA)
values were measured.
Results: FA and ADC values were not influenced by
GA at birth. Mean FA of the total white matter was
lower in infants with diffuse excessive high signal
intensities (DESHI) than in infants without DESHI
(p<0.05). Moreover, low FA values in PLIC correlated
to low Apgar scores (p<0.05).
Conclusions: We have obtained DTI in a cohort of
ELGA infants. FA and ADC values did not change with
GA, possibly due to the narrow range of GA in this
cohort. In agreement with a previous study (Counsell et
al, Pediatrics 2006), we found changes in diffusion in
infants with DESHIs, indicating altered WM
organisation. Interestingly, FA values in the PLIC at
term-equivalent age also varied with Apgar score,
indicating early impact on WM microstructure in a
region where MRI findings correlates to later outcome.

Background and Aims: Previous studies have shown
that zinc supplementation has a positive short-term
influence on growth; however, the long-term effect of
zinc on growth and mental development of preterm
infants has not been well studied, and these were our
aims.
Methods: We studied 40 preterm infants fed with a
standard term-infant formula supplemented with zinc
(SG, n=20, BW:1645+440 g; GA: 32.2+2.3 w) or
without supplementation (CG, n= 20, BW: 1700+326 g.;
GA: 32.1+2.0 w) from 36 weeks postconceptional age
until 6 months corrected postnatal age (CA). At 9 and 12
months CA and at 4 years of age anthropometric
variables and total body water (TBW) estimated by
- 154 -
bioelectrical impedance (BI) were measured. Mental
development (McCarthy scale) was evaluated at four
years of age.
Results: On admission the SG and CG (W: 2.27+0.28
vs 2.28+0.14 kg; length: 45.2+2.0 vs 45.9+1.6 cm) did
not differ in the variables studied. Analysis of variance
test for repeated measurements showed significant
differences between groups in length (p=0.005) and
TBW (p=0.02), with higher values in the SG at 9
(length: 72.6+1.9 vs 70.9+2.0 cm; TBW: 4.5+0.5 vs
4.1 +0.4 kg) and 12 months (length: 77.0+2.5 vs
74.8+2.1 cm; TBW: 6.0+0.7 vs 5.6+0.6 kg) and at 4
years of age (length: 105.1+3.3 vs 102.5+3.0 cm; TBW:
10.5+1.0 vs 9.7+1.0 kg). There were no significant
differences between groups in the mental age (4.1+0.6
vs 4.3+0.3 years).
Conclusions: Premature infants receiving zinc
supplementation showed increased long-term linear
growth at four years of age, but no difference in mental
development was observed.

Background and Aims: The olfactory system is
functional at birth and learned responses to odours have
been demonstrated during the first postnatal days.
Labour contractions and vaginal delivery activate the
locus coeruleus and result in a massive release of
norepinephrine that rapidly declines during the first 1-2
hours after birth. Norepinephrine and locus coeruleus
activity have been implicated in olfactory learning in
rodent pups. We therefore hypothesized that a brief
window of time immediately after delivery may be a
particularly sensitive period for the development of
olfactory learning by human neonates.
Methods: Vaginally delivered infants were exposed to
an odorant for 30 min. Beginning 4 -54 min. after birth
(Early exposure) or 12-h post-partum (Late exposure).
Several days later they were tested for their responses to
the exposure odour versus an unfamiliar odour or an
odourless control stimulus.
Results: Infants that had been exposed to an odorant
immediately after birth spent significantly more time
oriented towards that scent rather than a novel odour, or
an odourless stimulus, during subsequent test trials. In
contrast, infants in the Late exposure condition did not
respond preferentially to the exposure odour.
Conclusions: Infants in the Early exposure group, but
not those in the Late exposure group, became familiar
with the exposure odour and retained a memory trace of
it during the test trials. Newborn infants are
physiologically prepared for efficient olfactory learning
within a limited interval of time shortly after birth.
IS HISTOLOGICAL CHORIOAMNIONITIS A
NEUROPROTECTIVE FACTOR FOR ELBW?

Centre Hospitalier Intercommunal de Creteil, Creteil,
France
Background and Aims: The rapid evolution in the care
of extremely premature babies requires evaluation of
neurological outcome of infants treated. This study aims
to evaluate known and possible risk factors of poor
neurological outcome in a population of inborn ELBW
<28wk GA. Using an ongoing systematic study of
placentas, we tried to evaluate the role of histological
chorioamnionitis (CAM) as a risk factor for poor
neurological outcome.
Methods: Retrospective monocentric study.
Neurological outcome was assessed at minimum age
one year or later. A logistic regression model was used
to analyse perinatal data, medical interventions and
postnatal morbidity. Histological analysis of the
placenta for CAM was available for 90% of the
population.
Results: 133 inborn ELBW <28wk GA were admitted
between 2000 and 2004. Among 105 survivors, 92
(87.6%) underwent neuro-developmental evaluation at
25 months median age (11-65 months). 25 (27.1%) had
an abnormal neurological examination; strabismus or
need for visual correction 7, isolated motor dysfunction:
7, global developmental delay:11. Factors associated
(p<0.1) with poor neurological outcome were: venous
umbilical catheterisation, postnatal systemic steroids,
fluid load before day 3, and length of mechanical
ventilation, central venous catheterisation or Doxapram
therapy. Surprisingly, the absence of histological CAM
(p=0,03) was also associated with abnormal
neurological outcome and remains the only independent
risk factor for poor neurological outcome after
multivariate analysis. The analysis of clinical versus
histological CAM as risk factors was not done.
Conclusions: Risk factors for abnormal neurological
outcomes in this population include common factors and
more unusual factors such as the absence of histological
CAM.

Netherlands
Background and Aims: A reliable method to assess the
presence of brain damage in infants is Prechtl's method
of the qualitative judgement of general movements
(GMs). The quality of GMs in preterm infants at
postnatal day 1 has not been investigated so far. Our aim
was to determine the quality of GMs in preterm infants
at postnatal day 1, and its relationship with perinatal
variables.
- 155 -
Methods: In 27 preterm infants, video recordings of
GMs were performed within 24h after birth and at
weekly intervals. The quality of GMs was assessed as
normal, abnormal or hypokinesia (H). Normal GMs are
movements that involve the whole body in a complex
sequence with variable intensity, force and speed.
Abnormal GMs lack complexity and variability. H is
defined as absence of GMs during at least 45 minutes
recording.
Results: All infants showed GMs of abnormal quality at
postnatal day 1. Eleven infants (41%) were hypokinetic.
H occurred more often in infants born before 30 weeks
of GA than in infants born after 30 weeks (10/17 vs
1/10, p<0.05). Perinatal metabolic acidosis (base excess
-5) occurred more often in hypokinetic infants than in
infants with abnormal GMs (10/11 vs 7/16, p<0.05). H
disappeared in all infants, and 13 infants had normal
GMs after 2 weeks.
Conclusions: H is common at postnatal day 1 in
preterm infants, especially at gestational ages <30
weeks. Perinatal hypoxia, reflected in metabolic
acidosis, may affect the quality of GMs at postnatal
day 1.

Background and Aims: Behavioural problems in
extremely preterm infants had not been paid much
attention to, although parents often focus on this issue.
We aimed to examine the prevalence of behavioural
problems in a cohort of extremely preterm infants.
Methods: Data from all liveborn infants (GA <27 wk)
born 2000 to 2002 at University Hospital Essen were
recorded. Survivors had been followed-up by clinical
examination and Bayley Scales II. Additionally, at 17 to
59 months corrected age, child behaviour was evaluated
by Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL) filled out by the
mothers.
Results: 79 infants were admitted. Forty-six (88%) of
52 survivors were followed-up. Birth weight: 360g -
1300g (median 680g), gestational age: 22-26 wk
(median 25 wk). Behaviour Rating Scales of Bayley II
were questionable in 7 and non-optimal in 3 children. 30
(83%) mothers of the 36 children who showed a normal
behaviour in the Bayley Scales filled out the CBCL: 5
(17%) children showed an abnormal total problem score
(1 'clinical range', 4 'borderline'). 12 (40%) children
were rated abnormal in one or several CBCL-Scales
(7 in >2 scales), mainly for the 'withdrawn' and the
'emotionally reactive' scales. In the DMS-Oriented
Scales 8 children showed abnormal behaviour
(4 'clinical range').
Conclusions: CBCL was a helpful tool to detect
behavioural problems missed by Bayley Scales II. 33%
of our extremely preterm infants with a normal score in
Bayley Behaviour Rating Scales showed behavioural
problems in CBCL-Scales.

Background and Aims: Follow-up data show a
constantly high rate of disability among extremely
preterm infants. Therefore, it is important to assess
short- and long-term outcome regularly to detect
changes.
Methods: Data from liveborn infants (GA <27 wk) born
01/2003 to 06/2004 were recorded. Children were
assessed at 18 months (17-22) corrected age by clinical
examination, Bayley Scales II, Child Behaviour Check
List (CBCL), assessment of height, body weight, head
circumference.
Results: 41 infants were born. Birth weight: 355g -
1100g (median 711g). 14 infants (34%) died, 8 in the
delivery room (22wk: 5/5; 23wk: 3/8), 6 in the NICU
(24wk: 4/10; 25wk: 1/9; 26wk: 1/9). There were ten
cases of IVH (I 5, II 4, III 1) and 15 of BPD among the
27 survivors. Follow-up is completed in 21 infants
(23 wk: 4/5; 24 wks: 6/6; 25wks: 5/8; 26 wks: 6/8).
Bayley Scales: Mental development-Scores (MDI) were
>84 in 17, 84-70 in 2, and <70 in 2 infants. Motor
development-Scores (PDI) were >84 in 17, 84-70 in 3,
and <70 in 1 infant. Behaviour Rating Scales were
questionable in 1 and non-optimal in 2 children. CBCL
of 11 children showed normal behaviour in 7 children,
abnormal (clinical) in 1, and behaviour at risk
(borderline) in 3 children. Height, body weight, and
head circumference were below 2 SD in (3/21), (5/21),
(7/21). One child died three months after assessment.
Conclusions: 18-months outcome data of this recent
cohort of extremely preterm infants were better than
expected. However, neurodevelopment has to be re-
evaluated at school age.

Background and Aims: The fetal inflammatory
response syndrome plays a central role in the
pathogenesis of white matter damage, i.e. cystic
periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) in the preterm
- 156 -
infant. High levels of proinflammatory cytokines
including interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been observed in
autopsies of brains of these infants. Thus, an association
between IL-6 -174 (G/G, G/C or C/C) polymorphism,
affecting IL-6 transcription rate and plasma cytokine
levels, and development of PVL might be hypothesized.
Methods: The study group (cases) compromised infants
with diagnosis of cystic PVL out of a single centre
cohort from 1988 to 2005 and their parents. The control
group (controls) included healthy newborns born
between April and June 2002. Analysis of IL-6 -174
polymorphisms was performed in cases and their parents
from venous blood samples after parental informed
consent and in controls from umbilical cord blood
samples. Samples were stored at -200 Celsius. IL-6
genotyping was performed using a polymerase chain
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
(PCR-RFLP) technique. The study was approved by the
local ethic committee. Results: Fifty-two cases (and 44
mothers) were enrolled and compared to 395 controls.
Differences regarding G/G, C/C, and G/C
polymorphisms were not significant between groups. An
increased rate of the IL-6-174 (C/C) polymorphism was
found in mothers of cases with history of
chorioamnionitis (7/23, 30.4%; p=0.0192).
Conclusions: We found a significant association
between IL-6-174 (C/C) polymorphism in mothers with
chorioamnionitis and preterm birth with subsequent
development of cystic PVL. In case of preterm PROM
knowledge of this polymorphism might influence timing
of delivery.

Background and Aims: Parenchymal lesions and
intraventricular haemorrhages in neonatal cerebral
ultrasound (US) are known as the most informative
neonatal prognostic findings. The prognostic value of
US ventriculomegaly is less documented. To estimate
developmental delay (DD) and cerebral palsy (CP)
occurrence at two years in children with isolated
ventriculomegaly at discharge vs. no abnormal US
findings.
Methods: Cohort study of VLBW or < 32 weeks infants
born in a single center (1991-2002). Data were collected
prospectively on US protocolised exams at 2, 7, 28 days
and at discharge: for each type of lesion, the more
severe was included. DD and motor development were
assessed at two years as part of a standardised follow-up
programme. Results: 1015 VLBW babies were born
during the 12 year study period; from this analysis were
excluded 190 who died, 29 with major malformations,
15 with incompleted US protocol, 90 lost-to-follow-up
and 259 with abnormal neonatal US findings other than
isolated ventriculomegaly. Assessment at 2 years was
performed on 346 children with normal neonatal US and
on 87 children with isolated ventriculomegaly. Children
with ventriculomegaly had shown lower birthweight,
lower GA and higher morbidity. DD was present in
9.2% (32/346) of the children with normal US and in
20.6% (18/87) of the children with isolated
ventriculomegaly (odds ratio 2.6; 1.3-5.0). No
differences were found in CP rates between groups.
Conclusions: Children with isolated ventriculomegaly
showed a two-fold increased risk of developmental
delay compared with children with no US abnormalities
at discharge.

Background and Aims: The risks of triple pregnancies
are related to perinatal morbidity, but several other
factors can influence development. The aims of this
study are: 1) To identify significant perinatal and
postnatal variables on triplets’ development; 2) To
compare development of triplets followed at the
Developmental Clinic with those not followed and with
age-matched controls.
Methods: We assessed retrospectively 15 sets of triplets
born between 1998 and 2004. The triplets were divided
in Group A (9 sets) followed at Developmental Clinic
and Group B (6 sets), called for evaluation later.
Medical records were reviewed for perinatal variables.
Griffiths’ scale was used for developmental assessment.
Both groups were compared with each other and with
age-matched control groups. Statistical analysis was
performed with SPSS 12, considering significant
p<0.05.
Results: Statistical analysis comparing neonatal
variables and Griffiths’ total developmental quotient
(DQ) is shown in Table 1. When compared to age-
matched controls DQs from group A were statistically
similar, while DQs from group B were significantly
lower.
Conclusions: Despite a more severe perinatal course,
followed triplets had higher DQs than not followed
ones. Better outcomes of babies that were followed
could relate to anticipation of developmental issues and
increased support to the family. Social-familial factors
should be taken into account and subject to further
research. Triplets, whatever their perinatal course,
should be followed after discharge.

Background and Aims: Hemorheological and
metabolic disorders in hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy require the beginning of early correction
of these disorders as soon as possible and explains the
search of new methods of treatment for newborns with
this pathology.
Methods: To evaluate efficacy of Solkoseryl in the
complex therapy of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in
newborns. Thirty newborns with hypoxic
encephalopathy were studied. Solkoseryl was prescribed
in dose 0.3-0.5 ml (4% solution) per kg/body mass in a
day. The indications for prescription were marked
hypoxic-ischemic disorders identified with use of
neurosonography, computed tomography and dopplero-
graphy. Solkoseryl was prescribed during the period of
ear rehabilitation of hypoxic-ischemic disorders. The
course of treatment was 10-20 injections. If it was
necessary the course of therapy repeated every 4-6
weeks. Therapy was performed in 30 preterm infants.
Results: There is noted positive dynamics of
neurological disorders regress: restoration of
consciousness with appearance of attempts of visual
contact with a child. Improvement of emotional sphere,
restoration of the functions such as swallowing and
suckling. The methods of neurovisualization were used
for diagnosis of stopping of postischemic necrosis, as
well as increase in blood flow velocity in the vertebro-
basilar bed.
Conclusions: The active strategy in relation to infants
with heavy hypoxic-ischemic disorders in the neonatal
period including metabolic therapy with preparation
Solkosery resulted in improvement of prognosis that is
confirmed both by neurosonographic monitoring and
dopplerography findings.

Background and Aims: To analyse the effectiveness of
therapeutic touch on weight, number of postnatal
complications, hospital stay and parent satisfaction of
premature newborns.
Methods: A random, controlled, experimental study in
the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in Virgin Macarena
University Hospital of premature newborns who are
randomly assigned to the control group and who fulfil
the established protocol of the inclusion criteria for the
following two years of study. To determine the sample
size, weight gain is used as the main variable. We are
considering approximately 80 subjects in the study (40
per group), to try to find a minimum relevant difference
of 50gr, considering an alpha 0.025 as a significant
level, and a unilateral character of the test hypothesis
potency at 80%. Data collection is done in a specifically
designed registry, where the measures of variable results
are reflected: Weight, postnatal complications, hospital
stay, parent satisfaction and control variables. Statistical
descriptions for the experimental and control group will
be calculated. In order to compare quantitative
information between the groups, a Student T test for
independent samples or non parametric test U of Mann-
Whitney.
Results: To date there are 11 children included in the
study with a predicted 40 total by October, 2006, which
will provide more conclusive results.
Conclusions: The conclusions will be presentable upon
the inclusion of up to 40 participants as outlined in the
results.

Background and Aims: Our understanding of the
influence of perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia (HI) on the
brainstem in preterm infants remains very limited. To
further the understanding we examined functional status
of the auditory brainstem following high-rate click
stimulation in preterm infants.
Methods: The subjects were 35 preterm infants who
had clinical signs of perinatal HI and a depression of
Apgar score ( 6 at 5 min), with gestation 28-36 wks.
The controls were 35 age-matched preterm infants with
no perinatal problems. Brainstem auditory evoked
response (BAER) was studied using maximum length
sequence at 37-42 wks postconceptional age.
Results: The preterm infants with perinatal HI showed a
significantly prolonged wave V latency at the highest
click rate 910/s (ANOVA p <0.05) and prolonged I-V
interval at very high rates 455/s and 910/s (p<0.01 and
0.001). I-III interval was similar to the controls. III-V
interval was significantly prolonged at all click rates
(91-910/s), particularly at the very high rates (p<0.05-
0.001). III-V/I-III interval ratio also increased
significantly at all rates. Wave III amplitude was smaller
at all rates (p <0.05-0.01). Wave V amplitude was
significant smaller at 455/s and 910/s (p <0.01, 0.001).
- 158 -
These abnormalities became more significant with the
increase in click rate.
Conclusions: BAER variables, mainly reflecting central
auditory function, in preterm infants after HI were
generally near normal at lower rates of clicks but
abnormal at very higher rates (455/s and 910/s). Central
impairment due to perinatal HI in preterm infants is
unlikely to recover completely within a relatively short
period.

Background and Aims: The differential diagnosis of
neonatal hypotonia is extensive. This complicates the
diagnostic process, also the absence of a practical quick-
scan diagnostic procedure delays the diagnostic process.
Survival is uncertain. Our aim was to evaluate
retrospectively the relative prevalence, causes and
survival of neonatal hypotonia in newborns admitted to
a level three NICU.
Methods: A retrospective cohort study of neonates
presenting with neonatal hypotonia from January 1990
to January 1994 and from December 1996 to December
1999. Patients were subdivided into practical categories
of neonatal hypotonia and the mortality rate was
determined. The diagnostic procedure was evaluated.
Results: Discharge records of 134 patients with
neonatal hypotonia were found. The study cohort was
subdivided into the following 7 practical categories:
asphyxia and/or intracranial bleeding (n=97), infection
(n=5), medication (n=3), neuro-metabolic disorders
(n=8), chromosomal disorders (n=7), syndromal
disorders (n=8) and idiopathic neonatal hypotonia with
total recovery (n=6). Total mortality rate was 45%
(n=60). The mortality rate in each category: asphyxia
and/or intracranial bleeding 40% (n=39), infection 60%
(n=3), medication 33% (n=1), neuro-metabolic disorders
100% (n=8), chromosomal disorders 57% (n=4),
syndromal disorders 63% (n=5).
Conclusions: The majority of neonatal hypotonia was
acquired perinatal, especially by asphyxia and/or
intracranial bleeding. 17,5% was caused by an innate
disorder. Mortality rate by innate disorders was very
high, 17 out of 23 (74%). All patients with a neuro-
metabolic disorder died. In all patients with neonatal
hypotonia the diagnostic procedure should include
cerebral MRI and EEG; secondly metabolic and genetic
assessment is indicated in hypotonic patients without
asphyxia/intracranial bleeding or perinatal infection.

Background and Aims: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is
the most frequent cause of mortality and disability in
children between 0-14 years of age. Although diffuse
TBI represents the most common type of pediatric head
trauma, there are few available experimental models to
address the developmentally dependent response to such
injury. We utilized a new rat model of diffuse TBI to
study the graded response to head injury as a function of
developmental age.
Methods: TBI was induced in 7-day old rats using the
Cernak diffuse injury model. Edema formation was
assessed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
imaging, bioenergetic state by magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, blood brain barrier permeability by
extravasation of Evans blue, functional outcome by
motor and cognitive tests, and morphological changes
by histology and immunohistochemistry.
Results: Injury induced vasogenic brain edema
beginning 20 min post-injury and becoming primarily
cytotoxic by 24 h. There were no significant changes in
brain energy metabolism after moderate trauma,
suggesting a greater capacity of the immature brain to
maintain normal cerebral bioenergetics after injury
compared to adult animals. Diffuse morphological
changes were found in the cortex, hippocampus,
thalamus, and cerebellum of injured pups, including
activation of microglia, caspase-3 and apoptosis
inducible factor (AIF). These histological and
histochemical changes were associated with long- term
motor and cognitive deficits.
Conclusions: Our findings underscore the differences in
the pathophysiology of TBI between young animals and
adults and suggest that this new experimental model
may be useful for evaluating differences in injury
mechanisms and therapy as a function of developmental
age.

Background and Aims: Congenital malformations
(CM) are defined as abnormal structure of the organism
resulting from disrupted embryogenesis. Regarding
different criteria and authors, the incidence of CM at
newborns is between 2 – 7%. The aim of this paper was
to determine the incidence of CM at liveborns delivered
at SHGO Cair, Skopje, during the five years period
(2000-2004). Also, the distribution among organ
systems had been analysed.
Methods: A retrospective analysis of 19097 liveborns
delivered at SHGO Cair, during 2000-2004, has been
- 159 -
performed. Database (Access 2000) from Neonatal Unit
has been used. The incidence and percentage of CM
among different systems have been determined.
Results: Among a total of 19097 leveborns, 736 or
3,85% have had CM. The incidence between different
years was: 4,28% in 2000, 3,92% - 2001, 3,79% - 2002,
3,20% - 2003 and 3,98% in 2004. Regarding different
organ systems, the distribution was: 58,1% of all CM
were the anomalies of musculoskeletal system, 14,6% -
cardiopathies, 8,1% - anomalies of uro-genial system,
7,2% - CM of gastro-intestinal system, etc.
Conclusions: During the five years period, the
incidence of CM is 3,85%, which is in accordance with
data from literature. Among years, the incidence varies
from 3,2 to 4,3%. The anomalies of musculoskeletal
system are the most frequent, followed by those from
cardiovascular, uro-genital, gastro-intestinal and central
nervous system. Congenital malformations still remain
an important medical and social problem requesting
more serious nationwide engagement.

Background and Aims: Visfatin is a recently
discovered cytokine that is preferentially produced in
visceral adipose tissue. Its role appears to be
controversial; on one hand, it facilitates fat deposition
and increases in states of insulin resistance; on the other
hand, it has been documented to exert insulin-mimetic
effects in various tissues. This study aimed to
investigate visfatin levels in full-term intrauterine
growth restricted (IUGR- below the 10th customized
centile) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA)
fetuses (UC) and neonates on day 1 (N1) and 4 (N4)
postpartum, as well as in their mothers (MS) before
delivery.
Methods: Blood serum visfatin levels were measured in
20 IUGR and 20 AGA mother-infant sets by enzyme
immunoassay.
Results: N1 and N4 visfatin levels were significantly
higher in IUGR compared with AGA neonates (p=0.011
and p=0.026, respectively). In the AGA group, a
positive correlation was demonstrated between N1
visfatin levels and infant centiles (r=0.452, p=0.045);
additionally, a similar correlation was found between
N4 visfatin levels and infant centiles, as well as birth
weight (r=0.455, p=0.044, and r=0.558, p=0.011,
respectively). Finally, in the IUGR group, a negative
correlation was documented between MS visfatin levels
and infant centiles (r=-0.643, p=-0.002).
Conclusions: Insulin resistance in IUGR neonates could
possibly explain high N1 and N4 visfatin levels. The
strong association between visfatin levels and centiles in
AGA neonates could be attributed to its production in
adipose tissue. Pathology in pregnancy, leading to
IUGR, could also be responsible for maternal visfatin
levels.

Background and Aims: Alarms in a neonatal intensive
care unit are triggered by vital signs measurements
crossing preset thresholds. This is a crude way of
drawing attention to changes in the physiological state
of an infant, having low specificity and being affected
by artifactual measurements. We aimed to construct a
statistical model which could be used to infer clinically
significant physiological changepoints at the cotside.
Methods: A factorial switching Kalman filter (FSKF)
was used to model monitoring data. In previous work
such a model has been used to identify monitoring
artifacts. An extra factor (referred to as the 'X-factor')
was added, accounting for observations not
corresponding to either a baby's baseline dynamics or to
any known artifactual patterns. Given test data, the
FSKF can then infer the probability that the X-factor
was active at any point. Eight test periods of monitoring
data, 1-3 hours in duration and containing different
types of physiological change, were taken from 4
infants. Measurements consisted of heart rate, blood
pressures, and SpO2 sampled at 1 Hz. An experienced
clinician annotated the times that significant
physiological changes occurred, which was used as a
gold standard.
Results: FSKF inferences were compared against the
gold standard using Receiver Operating Characteristics
(ROC) curves. Evaluations were performed for different
categories of physiological change, with the results
shown in the table.
Conclusions: The FSKF model can be effective in
identifying some types of clinically significant
physiological changes in neonates.

Background and Aims: P.Ox display of HR and SpO2
is a useful guide during intubation attempts (Intub) and
- 160 -
surfactant administration (Surf). Video-recording of
resuscitations enables critical review and quality
improvement.
Methods: We evaluated HR and SpO2 values during
resuscitations of 33 infants < 1250 gm; 28 were
intubated for surfactant. We video-recorded P.Ox
readings combined with the baby using a specially
designed mobile video system.
Results: Infants arrived on the bed at 22.5 +/- 8 s. Initial
P.Ox readings were at 1 min 49 s +/- 30 s after birth (all
by 3 min); 24 +/- 25 s (Median 14 s) after sensor
connected. Initial HR: <100 bpm in 9/33, >100 bpm in
24/33; and SpO2: <60% in 12/33, 60-80% in 7/33,
>80% in 14/33. HR remained >100 bpm during 39/42
Intub, and SpO2 remained within 15% of baseline in
39/42 Intub. After successful intubations, 3/28 had
delayed improvement of SpO2 until ETT pulled back;
all other 25/28 had increasing SpO2 within 5-10 s of
completion. Surf was tolerated well in 24/28. However,
2 infants (both 750-999 gm) decreased SpO2 to 77%
and 68%, and 2 infants (both 500-749 gm) decreased
SpO2 to 36% and 27% - the latter with bradycardia -
related to insufficient ventilation and weaned FiO2. All
recovered with increased ventilation and FiO2.
Conclusions: HR and SpO2 readings were readily
obtained and helped guide adjustments to ventilation
and FiO2, timing and duration of Intub attempts, as well
as aid assessment of ETT position and tolerance to Surf
administration. Supported by Nellcor (Tyco).
NEONATAL OUTCOMES IN ASSISTED TWIN
PREGNANCIES: INTRACYTOPLASMIC SPERM

Catholic University of Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy
Background and Aims: The Assisted Reproductive
Techniques (ART) have become a routine infertility
treatment. International data suggest the high rates of
multiple pregnancies, prematurity, low birth-weight, and
neonatal morbility in ART conceived births. The aim of
this study is to compare perinatal and neonatal outcomes
in IVF twin pregnancies to those conceived by ICSI
delivered at Gemelli Hospital.
Methods: We studied 29 assisted twin pregnancies: 12
ICSI and 17 IVF. All twins were evaluated for prenatal
outcomes (maternal age, pregnancy complications and
placentation) and neonatal outcomes (gestational age,
birth-weight, small-for-gestational-age (SGA), birth-
weight discordance >20%, depression at birth, major
neonatal diseases, NICU admissions and neonatal
mortality).
Results: Data concerning prenatal outcomes, gestational
age, birth-weight, rate of SGA, birth-weight
discordance, depression at birth and neonatal mortality,
were similar in the two groups. A significantly higher
rate of ICSI twins affected by major neonatal diseases
(50% vs 20.6%, p <0.05) and of NICU admissions (50%
vs 11.8%, p 0.002) was observed comparing the two
groups. No significant differences were observed in
prenatal outcomes, gestational age and birth-weight
matching the twins of the two groups according to the
presence of major neonatal diseases and NICU
admission. In the ICSI group we observed: one case of
anencephaly, two cases of pharmacologically treated
PDA and one case of surgically treated NEC.
Conclusions: Our study suggests a significantly higher
rate of neonatal morbidity in ICSI twins than IVF twins.
The adverse neonatal outcomes in ICSI group could be
due to micromanipulation of gametes. Further studies
are necessary to confirm these findings.

Background and Aims: Very low birth weight infants
need close control of their thermal environment in order
to maintain their optimal temperature. Transepidermal
water loss plays an important role in energy loss in case
the humidity setting is inadequate. An optimal humidity
protocol could lead to a reduction of time to regain birth
weight. Aim of this study is to compare the effect of a
mandatory and free chosen incubator humidity strategy
to increase weight in preterm infants within the first two
weeks of life.
Methods: Two groups of premature infants of 24-30
weeks gestational age and with a birth weight less than
1500 gram were studied in a prospective randomized
controlled way. The Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis
was used to compare days to regain birth weight.
Results: 136 infants were enrolled, 71 infants in the
control group and 65 infants in the experimental group.
The demographic characteristics were not statistically
different between both groups birth weight (0.981 +
0.245 vs 0.991 + 0.213) kg, mean gestational age (27.7
weeks + 1.7 vs 27.7 +1.6). Analysis shows an equal
number of days to regain birth weight in the control and
experimental group (mean 9 vs. 9 days 95% CI 8-10 vs
7-11). In addition the mean infants central temperature
during the first 14 days was not significant different.
Conclusions: Both humidification strategies are
associated with similar outcomes.

Institute, Stockholm, Sweden
Background and Aims: To determine length of
hospital stay (LOS) for moderately preterm infants
during the last twenty years and to identify factors
affecting the number of bed-days.
- 161 -
Methods: Review of LOS for all infants delivered
between 30 to 34 gestational weeks during 1983, 1988,
1993, 1998 and 2002. Exclusion criteria: life threatening
abnormalities, chromosomal anomalies and death during
hospitalization.
Results: 564 included infants accounted for 20% of
admissions and 48% of bed-days in the neonatal unit.
Between 1983 and 2002, maternal age and use of nasal
continuous positive airway pressure increased, use of
antibiotics and mechanical ventilation decreased,
whereas distributions for gestational age, birth weight,
gender, smallness for gestational age, low Apgar score
or RDS incidence did not change. For healthy inborn
singletons discharged at home, LOS decreased from
1983 (28 ± 11 d, mean ± SD values) to 2002 (14 ± 7 d,
p < 0.05). Infants born more immature had longer LOS,
but postconceptional age at discharge did not differ
between age groups.
Conclusions: LOS for moderately preterm infants has
decreased as a result of individualized neonatal care and
organization of homecare support. Shorter LOS is of
benefit for the family, prevents overcrowding in the
NICU and has important economic implications.

Background and Aims: The provision of a
comprehensive programme of postgraduate education
for trainees in neonatology can be a challenge for
individual centres. Reasons for this include the small
numbers of trainees in any one hospital and time
constraints. The Internet offers the potential for the
development of educational programmes which are
standardised, flexible and widely accessible, irrespective
of time and place. We report initial data concerning a
multi-national European Commission funded project
designed to provide a collaborative educational
programme covering topics defined in the European
training syllabus.
Methods: Six modules, incorporating a range of
multimedia and case-based scenarios, have been
developed for delivery within a “virtual learning
environment”. Topics include: neurology, ethics,
epidemiology, nutrition, respiration and early care of the
very low birthweight baby. Cross-cultural collaborative
learning is promoted by internet-based discussions
which are facilitated by a team of online tutors.
Recruitment of trainees was via e-mail contact with
members from the European Society of Paediatric
Research (ESPR).
Results: 107 doctors from 15 countries have been
enrolled. At the programme mid-point 77% were still
participating of whom 67% provided evaluation data:
90% reported that the programme provides “added
value” to their training, characterised as an “increase in
the level of knowledge, the “sharing of knowledge and
experience” and the “quality of the learning
experience”. The main limiting factor has been time.
Conclusions: Neonatal trainees require flexible,
structured educational opportunities involving the
sharing of clinical practice and experience. Online
learning may help meet this demand and provide a focus
for future ESPR educational programmes.

Background and Aims: Steady blood flow between the
foetus and the placenta is crucial for normal prenatal
development. Since with the exception of the foetal end
the umbilical cord lacks innervation, we hypothesised
the presence of specialized pacemaker cells in the wall
of the umbilical vessels that might contribute to the
coordinated function of smooth muscle cells. C-kit
protein is considered to be a specific marker for
pacemaker cells in the gastrointestinal tract, known as
interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) and c-kit-
immunoreactive pacemaker cells have recently been
discovered in the rabbit portal vein.
Methods: C-kit antibody was used on paraffin and on
ultrathin sections of umbilical veins obtained from
normal-term vaginal deliveries. C-kit-immunoreactivity
was visualized by diaminobenzidine (DAB) and 5nm
gold-conjugated antibody.
Results: In paraffin sections a dense network of c-kit-
immunoreactive cells was visible under the endothelial
cell layer. The c-kit-immunoreactive cells had an
irregular shape and numerous long processes extending
to neighbouring cells. At the ultrastructural level, c-kit-
immunoreactivity was most often seen in the cell
processes. DAB precipitate and gold particles were
localized around the endoplasmic reticulum, transport
vesicles and caveolae.
Conclusions: Based on their c-kit-immunoreactivity and
on their morphological characteristics we assume that
the c-kit-labelled cells in the wall of the umbilical vein
are ICC-like cells. ICC-like cells in human blood vessels
have not been identified previously. In the human
umbilical vein, the ICC-like cells may play an important
role in the regulation of peristaltic-like waves of
- 162 -
umbilical smooth muscle cells thereby ensuring a steady
foeto-placental blood flow.
THE CONCEPT OF CHRONIC PAIN IN THE
NEONATE, A DELPHI SURVEY
C J L M Van Ganzewinkel
NICU, Máxima Medical Centre, Veldhoven, The
Netherlands
Background and Aims: A literature review revealed
that the concept of chronic pain in the newborn has
hardly received attention in pain research.
Conceptualisation is required to develop evidence based
pain assessment methods and to validate medical and
nursing interventions.
Methods: A Delphi survey consisting of 3 rounds was
conducted in an international and multidisciplinary
panel of experts. The first round consisted of three open-
ended questions and aimed at identifying the opinion of
the experts on the definition, aetiology and diagnostic
determinants of chronic pain. The two subsequent
rounds aimed at reaching consensus on the opinions.
Results: Four of the originally 11 invited experts
entered the study. 3 experts were included following
recommendation by originally invited experts. In
defining chronic pain the factor time was found to be
essential. Necrotising enterocolitis is thought to be an
aetiological determinant. None of the diagnostic
determinants seemed to have sufficient sensitivity and
specificity to be useful in the assessment of chronic
pain. Several experts stated that chronic pain and stress
were interrelated.
Conclusions: This study showed some methodological
imperfections in both design and process. It is hardly
possible to reach valid conclusions. We propose to
speak in terms of ‘prolonged pain’, not chronic pain.
This study suggests that prolonged pain in the newborn
is pain lasting longer than 7 days. Prolonged pain is
suggested to result from or can even exist in absence of
noxious stimuli. Necrotising enterocolitis is suggested to
be an important aetiological determinant. In this study,
no diagnostic determinant with sufficient sensitivity and
specificity was identified.

Background and Aims: Neonatal clinical examination
for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) remains
controversial in relation to its sensitivity and specificity.
This study evaluates the accuracy of neonatal hip
examination in detection of truly dislocated hips.
Methods: Infants born National Maternity Hospital
January 2004- December 2005 included. Following
clinical suspicion of dislocated/dislocatable hip by
consultant paediatrician, hip ultrasound day 3
performed. Infants with dislocated hips with dysplasia
on ultrasound, treated with Pavlik harness; infants with
dysplasia or mild instability followed with 8 week
ultrasound or referred to orthopaedics. 8 week hip
ultrasound performed for all infants with stable hips on
exam but who met following criteria: (1) 1st degree
relative with DDH; (2) breech; (3) persistant 'click'. All
ultrasounds performed by same consultant paediatric
radiologist (VBD).
Results: 15988 infants born during study period. 58
with unstable hips day 2 examination had day 3
ultrasound. Scan findings: 43 infants had dislocated
hip(s), 5 had normal acetabuli with mildly subluxable
hip(s), 2 had dysplasia, 8 normals. Thus neonatal exam
for truly dislocated hips had positive pickup rate:
74.14% (43/58) and false positive rate: 25.86% (15/58).
45 (77.59%) infants treated with Pavlik harness, 13
(22.41%) followed with serial ultrasounds, no active
intervention required. Based on above criteria, 1604 hip
ultrasounds performed at 8 weeks. Scan findings:4
(0.25%) infants had dislocated hips, 50 (3.12%) had
dysplasia. In high risk infants, hip exam day 2 had false
negative rate: 0.25%.
Conclusions: Use of early hip ultrasound to inform the
management of infants with clinically unstable hips
reduces risk of unnecessary treatment by abduction
splinting.
SERUM ALBUMIN AS A PREDICTOR OF
MORTALITY IN PRETERM INFANTS
I Morris, E J Molloy
Department of Neonatology, National Maternity
Hospital, Dublin, Ireland
Background and Aims: Albumin has long been
recognised as a predictor of patient outcome in adult
medicine. However, its use as a prognostic tool remains
less clear in paediatrics, particularly in neonates. We
aimed to evaluate the use of serum albumin in neonates
as a predictor of morbidity and mortality.
Methods: All neonates <1500g delivered in a tertiary
referral centre were included over a 1 year period. The
relationship between earliest and lowest recorded serum
albumin levels and mortality and morbidity (incidence
of IVH, NEC, and length of hospital stay) was
evaluated.
Results: 115 infants were included with a mean
(standard deviation) gestational age of 28.3 (2.7) weeks
and birth weight of 1070 (275)g. There was a
statistically significant association between lowest
albumin levels and mortality (p= <0.001), which
remained when adjusting for birth weight and
gestational age (p=0.002). There was also an association
with incidence of NEC (p=0.027) although this did not
remain with adjustment (p=0.067). There was no
significant association between lowest albumin and
either IVH (p=0.298), or length of hospital stay
(p=0.379).
Conclusions: Although serum albumin did not predict
morbidity, there was a statistically significant
association with neonatal mortality in preterm infants.

EARLY BLOOD LACTATE CONCENTRATION
AND CRIB SCORE AS PREDICTORS OF
MORTALITY IN VERY LOW BIRTH WEIGHT
BABIES

R W Cooke, C W Yoxall
Department of Neonatology, Liverpool Women's
Hospital, Liverpool, UK
Background and Aims: Early identification of very
low birth weight (VLBW) babies with a high risk of
mortality may be beneficial. Blood lactate
concentrations ([L]) have been shown to be associated
with adverse outcomes in other critically ill patient
groups. The aim of this study was to investigate the
predictive value of [L] in VLBW babies and to compare
this with CRIB score.
Methods: All babies admitted to the neonatal unit with
a birth weight of less than 1501 grams during 2001-2004
were included. CRIB score, [L] in the first 12 hours and
clinical outcome were obtained.
Results: Out of 409 babies, CRIB score was available in
327 babies and [L] in 374 babies. First [L] was
significantly higher in babies who died compared to
those who survived (median (range) 9.17 (1.26 to 21.1)
mmol/L vs 3.64 (0.67 to 17.9) mmol/L, p<0.0001). The
highest [L] in the first 12 hours also was significantly
higher in those who died compared to those who
survived (10.20 (3.37 to 26) mmol/L vs 3.84 (1.05 to
20.7) mmol/L, p<0.0001). The area under the ROC
curves for predicting death for first [L] and highest [L]
respectively were 0.772 (95% CI 0.694-0.850) and
0.854 (95% CI 0.799-0.908). For CRIB score, the area
under the ROC curve was 0.932 (95% CI 0.893-0.968).
Conclusions: Early hyperlactataemia is a predictor of
death in VLBW babies. However, it does not appear to
be better than CRIB score.

Background and Aims: A prospective study involving
900 uneventful, term, singleton pregnancies undergoing
elective Caesarean section. The aim of the study was to
evaluate if acid-base status at birth and early neonatal
outcome were statistically different in women
undergoing general vs spinal and epidural anesthesia.
Methods: Acid-base assessment at birth was derived
from blood samples obtained either from umbilical cord
artery and vein. Neonatal outcome measurements
considered were 1- and 5-min Apgar score 3, transfer
to NICU, need for ventilation, neonatal seizures,
hypotonia and coma, neonatal hypoglicemia and
survival.
Results: Fetal oxygenation as expressed by an umbilical
cord artery PO2 showed higher values in women under
general when compared to both spinal and epidural
anaesthesia. Newborns in the epidural group
demonstrated an higher pH higher BB. Early neonatal
outcome showed statistical significant differences with
regards to neonatal depression (1-min Apgar score 3)
between general anaesthesia and spinal and need for
assisted ventilation, between general and spinal and
epidural group.
Conclusions: General anaesthesia showed the highest
umbilical artery PO2 values although epidural
anaesthesia can be considered the method of choice in
terms of highest metabolic parameters and lowest
neonatal complications. General anaesthesia was
associated with the highest incidence of neonatal
depression although transient in duration and not severe
in degree.

Medicine, Tel Aviv, Israel
Background and Aims: It has been suggested that
phototherapy might increase hemolysis, due to increase
in heme oxygenase activity and/or oxidative injury to
the red blood cells membrane. The objective of the
study was to test the hypothesis that ETCO
concentrations, an index of hemoglobin degradation,
increase during phototherapy and decrease after its
interruption in jaundiced neonates.
Methods: ETCOc concentration was measured using a
CO breath analyzer, in 38 infants who developed
hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy. ETCOc
measurements were performed before and at 12, 24 and
48 hours of phototherapy and again before phototherapy
interruption and 12 hours afterward. Analyses were by
repeated measures ANOVA.
Results: Mean ETCOc before phototherapy was 2.4±0.6
ppm. No significant change in ETCOc occurred at 12,
24 and 48 hours of phototherapy (2.3±0.6ppm,
2.5±0.8ppm and 2.8±1 ppm respectively), neither 12
after phototherapy interruption. Nine out of 38 infants
(23%) had ABO incompatibility (positive direct
Coombs test). Mean ETCOc before phototherapy was
higher in these infants than in the others (2.8±0.4
compared with 2.2±0.5 ppm) (p = 0.006), but remained
also stable during the study period (2.3±1.1ppm,
3.2±0.8ppm, 3.3±1ppm and 3.0±1.1ppm at 12, 24 48
hours of phototherapy and 12 hours after its interruption,
respectively).
Conclusions: Phototherapy does not appear to increase
the rate of hemolysis, as demonstrated by the lack of
change in ETCO concentration during phototherapy and
after its interruption. Even in the presence of an existing
hemolytic process, phototherapy does not affect the rate
of hemoglobin degradation.

Background and Aims: The 10-point Apgar score has
successfully been used to assess the conditions and
prognosis of newborn infants since >50 years. However,
the relationship between Apgar scores and early
neonatal biochemistry remains unclear. Methods: A
total of 750 newborns (gestational age: 38.77 ± 2.25 wk;
birth weight 3195 ± 610 g) were evaluated for Apgar
scores at 1-min (APG-1) and 5-min (APG-5) of life.
Biochemical data were assessed by micro-methods on
capillary blood sampling 1 h after birth. Associations
between APG-1 or APG-5 and biochemical variables
were tested using Spearman's coefficient of rank
correlation (rho). Results: APG-1 was positively
correlated with blood pH (rho=0.258, p=0.0097), pO2
(0.269, p=0.0345), O2-saturation (0.271, p=0.0068),
O2-Hb (0.278, p=0.0055), Co-Hb (0.214, p=0.0328),
Na+ (0.241, p=0.0161), ABE (0.211, p=0.0345), and
HCO3- (0.226, p=0.0242), while was inversely related
to Hb-H (-0.248, p=0.0136) and met-Hb (-0.257,
p=0.0101). APG-5 was positively correlated with blood
pH (0.336, p=0.0008), pO2 (0.328, p=0.0010), O2-
saturation (0.337, p=0.0008), O2-Hb (0.341, p=0.0007),
Co-Hb (0.212, p=0.0349), Na+ (0.230, p=0.0217), ABE
(0.278, p=0.0055), and HCO3- (0.285, p=0.0045), while
was inversely correlated with Hb-H (-0.328, p=0.0011)
and met-Hb (-0.295, p=0.0032). APG-5, but not APG-1,
was positively related to Hct (0.226, p=0.0238). No
significant relationships with pCO2, total Hb, Hb-F,
glucose, Na+, K+, Ca++, Cl-, lactate, total bilirubin, or
SBE were evidenced. Conclusions: APG-1 and APG-5
are significantly linked to newborn's oxygenation,
although the strength of the observed associations is
weak.

Background and Aims: The value of the subjective
color component of Apgar score remains controversial.
Our aim was to objectively evaluate skin color in the
Apgar color classes: 0 (“blue” or pale) -1 (“pink” body
with “blue” extremities)-2 (entire body “pink”).
Methods: Skin color at 1, 5, and 10 min was rated in
Caucasian term newborns (n=50) and simultaneously
measured at 3 body sites (abdomen, hand, and foot) with
a portable spectrophotometer unit (400-700 nm
wavelengths range; standard D65 illuminant). “Pink”
control newborns (n= 50; age: 4 h) were also measured.
Spectral reflectance curves were analyzed and distances
( E) between colors for different body sites and color
classes were calculated (Colormedica software package,
IntexSystem).
Results: The E between Apgar color classes 0-1 and
1-2 were 4.16 ± 1.05 and 4.62 ± 0.18 for the abdomen
site, i.e., > 4-folds the psychophysical limit of ~1 E.
By contrast, a significant overlap among color classes
for the extremities was observed (p 0.25). E between
the Apgar color class 2 (i.e., “pink”) and controls) was
8.81 ± 5.64 (body site: abdomen) that is almost 9-folds
the psychophysical limit.
Conclusions: (1) Color variations among the Apgar’s
color classes are extremely wide, with significant
overlapping due to subjective classification; (2) color
class 2 is significantly different from the “pink” color,
as rated outside the early postnatal period, and the pink
color as intended in standard colorimetry. These data
indicate that the color component of the Apgar score
should be replaced by objective measures.

Background and Aims: Sepsis due to fungi accounts
for 9-12% of late-onset sepsis (LOS) among very low
birth weight (VLBW) infants, and is associated with
significant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this
population-based study was to evaluate the perinatal and
neonatal risk factors for fungal LOS, as compared to
bacterial LOS, in VLBW infants.
Methods: This is a population-based observational
study including all VLBW infants born in all 28 NICUs
in Israel. From 1995 through 2002, the Israel National
VLBW infant database gathered information on 11830
infants. The study population comprised 3054 infants
with one or more events of LOS. Univariate analysis
and logistic regression models were used to compare
infants with fungal sepsis only (n=179) and those with
bacterial sepsis only (n=2630), regarding various
perinatal and neonatal risk factors.
Results: The mean birth weight and gestational age of
infants with Candida LOS were significantly lower (940
± 271g; 27.1 ± 2.5 weeks) than those of the bacterial
LOS group (1027 ± 255 g; 28.3 ± 2.5 weeks) (p<0.001).
Logistic regression analysis shows that Candida sepsis,
- 165 -
as compared to bacterial sepsis, was independently
associated with decreasing gestational age and
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). In addition, BPD
only (OR 1.84; 95% C.I.:1.03-3.23) and BPD with
postnatal steroid therapy (OR 2.66; 95% C.I.: 1.59-4.46)
were independently associated with an increased risk for
Candida sepsis.
Conclusions: Compared to bacterial LOS, Candida LOS
in VLBW infants was independently associated with
decreasing gestational age and bronchopulmonary
dysplasia (BPD), especially when BPD was
accompanied with postnatal steroid therapy.

Preto, São Paulo, Brazil
Background and Aims: CMV specific humoral
immunity in pregnant women may play a role against
viral reactivation and congenital infection. We
compared CMV neutralizing (NTR) antibody titers
between transmitter (T) and non-transmitter (NT)
mothers.
Methods: Serum samples were obtained in the first
weeks of pregnancy (median= 13 weeks) and at delivery
from 26 mothers of infants identified as congenitally
infected by CMV (T) and 26 mothers of non-infected
infants (NT). CMV- neutralizing activity was quantified
by a microneutralization assay in the presence of guinea
pig complement with the AD169 CMV strain. In a
subset of (T) mothers the neutralization assay was also
performed with the viral isolate from the respective
infant.
Results: Maternal age was similar in both groups
(median=19 years). All mothers were found to be CMV
seropositive at first weeks of gestation. By then, lower
geometric mean titer of neutralizing activity was
detected in T mothers (87; range: 8-256) than in NT
mothers (131; 32-256) (p<0.01). Significant NTR titer
increments were detected in both groups from gestation
to delivery. However, reflecting higher increments
among T mothers, geometric mean titers were similar in
T (262; range: 64-512) and NT (236; 128-512) mothers
(p=0.17) at delivery. The use of infant CMV isolates for
testing NTR activity in T mothers revealed comparable
results to those found with CMV AD169 strains.
Conclusions: Low titers of neutralizing antibodies to
CMV in the first weeks of gestation are a correlate of
transmission of intrauterine CMV infection suggesting
that high titers are protective of its occurrence. Funded

Background and Aims: Reducing the use of antibiotics
in non-infected individuals has been identified as a
potential strategy to reduce the emergence of
multiresistant pathogens in the hospital environment. In
response to local research and audit findings we have
altered our practice: Antibiotics are stopped after
36hours if cultures are negative and the baby is well. A
direct computer link between the blood culture analyser
and the unit allows 24 hour access to blood culture
status. An audit was performed to measure the impact of
these changes on the number of antibiotic doses
administered on our unit.
Methods: The case notes of a random 5% sample of
babies with blood cultures taken before and after the
new policies were examined. Demographics, clinical
outcomes and number of antibiotic doses received by
each baby were recorded.
Results: Gestational age, birth weight, gender and age
were similar in both groups. There was no significant
difference in the duration of hospitalisation or mortality
rate between the 2 groups. The median (range) number
of antibiotic doses per baby in 1998 was 25 (0 to 231)
versus 14 (0 to 233) in 2004 (p=0.021). The estimated
reduction in total doses is 11000 per year (30 per day).
The pattern of antibiotic use had also changed.
Conclusions: Significant reduction of the number of
antibiotic doses administered can be safely achieved,
decreasing nursing workload and babies’ exposure to the
hazards of intravenous drug therapy, and possibly
helping to reduce the chances of the emergence of
antibiotic resistant bacteria.

Department Neonatology, Leiden University Medical
Centre, Juliana's Children's Hospital, The Hague, The
Netherlands
Background and Aims: Neonates at risk for sepsis
receive empirical antimicrobial treatment for 72 hours,
pending negative culture results. Benefits to minimise
treatment duration are evident. The Bactec 9240 detects
100% positive blood cultures within 30 hours. Thus, can
length of antibiotic therapy be shortened in these
neonates? The aim of this study is to determine the time
at which neonatal blood cultures can be considered
negative.
Methods: In a one-year (2005) prospective study we
collected 249 blood cultures from neonates admitted to
our neonatal unit. Time to positivity (TTP) (the time
- 166 -
between culture sampling and the moment the
neonatologist received the results) was calculated.
Incubation time was automatically registered.
Results: 48 out of 249 blood cultures were positive
(20%). 98% (47/48) of the positive cultures were
detected within 48 hours (figure). One sample had a
TTP of 50 hours. Maximum incubation time was 29,6
hours.
Conclusions: In clinical practice neonatal blood
cultures can be considered negative at 48 hours. We
suggest that antibiotic treatment for 48-hours in
asymptomatic neonates is sufficient. Logistic
optimisation can further reduce treatment duration.
IMMIGRATION FROM EASTERN EUROPE:
REAPPEARANCE OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS
IN THE ITALIAN POPULATION

Bologna, Bologna, Italy
Background and Aims: To evaluate the prevalence of
syphilis in pregnancy and congenital syphilis (CS) in an
Italian city, in relation to the increased immigration
flow.
Methods: A prospective surveillance study was carried
out in Bologna, Italy, from November 2000 to July
2005. All pregnant women were screened for syphilis at
delivery by enzymatic immunoassay. Positive samples
were then analysed by T. pallidum haemoagglutination
assay (TPHA), Western Blot (WB) and rapid plasma
reagin (RPR) tests. Infants born to seropositive mothers
were enrolled in a prospective follow-up.
Results: During the study period 16932 women gave
birth to 17238 infants. 79 infants were born to 70
mothers seropositive at delivery. The syphilis
seroprevalence in pregnant women was 0.41, but the
immigrant women were more likely to be seropositive
than Italian women (p=.0001). 8 women (11.4%), 7
from Eastern Europe, were found positive only at
delivery as they did not receive any prenatal care. Eight
infants (11.6%) born to mothers found to have syphilis
at delivery were all asymptomatic. 5 had both reactive
IgM WB and RPR tests and were considered as infants
with highly probable disease. All 5 infants were born to
mothers coming from Eastern Europe. Three out of five
were preterm.
Conclusions: The prevalence of CS in our area is 0.33
per 1000 live births, and it rises to 5.9 per 1000 live
births in infants born to mothers from Eastern Europe.
Therefore a closer prenatal screening for syphilis is
advisable for immigrant women to prevent CS.
TREATMENT OF NEONATES WITH CENTRAL
VENOUS CATHETER RELATED COAGUALSE-
NEGATIVE STAPHYLOCOCCAL SEPSIS USING
CONTINUOUS-INFUSION VANCOMYCIN
THERAPY
A B Kapetanakis, S Bradley, K Farrer
Regional Neonatal Unit, St George's Hospital, London,
UK
Background and Aims: Coagulase negative
staphylococci (CONS) are the most common cause of
catheter related blood stream infection (CR-BSI) in
neonates. Removal of the central venous catheters
(CVC’s) is often necessary. Attempts to treat using
conventional vancomycin dosing without removal of the
CVC’s have limited success. Vancomycin exhibits time
dependent activity. Continuous infusion (CI) of the drug
improves serum concentrations and bactericidal activity.
Methods: Prospective data collection from infants
treated for CR-BSITreatment was commenced using CI
Vancomycin administered via the CVC. All received a
loading dose (15mg/kg) followed by CI. The starting
doses were 15mg/kg/day-30mg/kg/day depending on
initial serum creatinine level. Blood cultures where
obtained before and during the antibiotic treatment, CRP
and serum creatinine were monitored. Vancomycin
levels were obtained at 24-48 hour intervals and the
dose adjusted accordingly. Target Vancomycin
concentrations were15-25mcg/ml.
Results: Mean (±Standard Deviation) 47 infants were
treated.7 had Broviac (BC), 40 Percutaneous-inserted
Catheters (PICC’s) 59 treatment episodes were
evaluated (14 in the BC group, 45 in the PICC group).
The gestational age was 25.1 (±3.2) weeks, the birth
weight was 0.74 (±0.8) KgPICC’s where in place for 22
(±0.9) days and the BC’s for 70.6 (±19) days. The
treatment duration was 7.8 (±0.7) days in the infants
with PICC,13.2 (±6.6) days in the infants with BC. All
patients had clinical improvement before the antibiotic
course was completed.
Conclusions: CONS CR-BSI was successfully treated
using CI vancomycin allowing for CVC’s retention. CI
vancomycin may offer advantages in treatment of
CONS sepsis when the CVC cannot be removed.

Background and Aims: Neonatal meningitis has a high
mortality and frequent neurological sequelae. The
importance of a lumbar puncture (LP) as part of the
diagnostic evaluation of neonates with suspected sepsis
has been subject of debate. Neonatologists often defer
the LP when evaluating the very low birth weight
(VLBW) infant (<1500 gram). We evaluated the utility
of LP's done routinely as part of complete workup in
neonatal sepsis.
Methods: A retrospective study was conducted to
evaluate LP's performed in VLBW infants admitted
between January 1, 1997, and January 1, 2004 who
survived for at least 3 days at the neonatal intensive care
unit (NICU) of Erasmus MC – Sophia Children’s
Hospital. Excluded were patients with posthemorrhagic
hydrocephalus requiring treatment. Late-onset
meningitis was defined by a CSF culture positive for
bacteria or fungi.
Results: Of 1443 VLBW infants, 798 LP’s were
performed in 544 patients. Thirteen infants had late-
onset meningitis acquired at the NICU. Thirty-one
percent of the infants had seizures. The cultured
microorganisms from CSF causing meningitis were -
hemolytic streptococcus group B (n=1), Escherichia coli
(n=3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1), Staphylococcus
aureus (n=3), Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (n=3),
Candida albicans (n=2). Only 1 of 13 (8%) infants with
meningitis had negative blood cultures.
Conclusions: Since only 1,6% of all LP's showed
meningitis, it is questionable whether LP's should be
routine investigation in VLWB infants suspected of an
infection. We suggest performing a LP in the presence
of seizures and/or in patients with blood cultures
positive for non-CoNS microorganisms.

University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary
Background and Aims: Breastfeeding and breast milk
has many known advantages, both to newborns and to
mothers. However, breast milk can also be the source of
infections transmitted from mothers to newborns, and
CMV transmission is probably the most common one.
Premature infants who acquire postnatal CMV infection
may develop a sepsis-like syndrome characterized by
respiratory distress, jaundice, hepato-splenomegaly,
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphocytosis. The
aim of our study was to estimate the significance of the
postnatal CMV infection in preterm infants.
Methods: In order to estimate the rate of severe CMV
infection the records of 413 preterm infants with birth
weight under 1500 g were reviewed retrospectively.
Own breast milk was universally administered from the
first day of life.
Results: The number of infants who had symptoms and
laboratory abnormalities that might have caused by
CMV was 30. Two of them had sepsis-like syndrome.
There is no screening for CMV among infants fed by
breast milk in our protocol, antibody measurement is
done when CMV is the possible causative agent of the
clinical and laboratory abnormalities. Only 5 infants of
the 30 presented positive result. There was no infant
death linked to CMV among the 413 preterm neonates.
Conclusions: In the light of the low number of serious
cases probably attributable to CMV, the fresh breast
milk may have potential risk for CMV infection in
premature infants, but the well known advantages of
breast milk outweigh this effect. Methods for milk
treatment and prevention of CMV infection are still
being under evaluation.
IMPACT OF MATERNAL CHORIOAMNIONITIS
ON OUTCOMES IN 28-32 WEEKS GESTATION
INFANTS
S Bhargava, M Khashu
BC Children's Hospital and University of British
Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada
Background and Aims: Histological chorioamnionitis
has been associated with preterm birth, major perinatal
morbidity and neonatal death. We investigated whether
clinical diagnosis of chorioamnionitis in a preterm
cohort would impact on need for resuscitation, neonatal
mortality and infant mortality.
Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of data from
the BC Perinatal Database Registry and Perinatal
Reporting Tool of the BC Reproductive Care Program.
We compared need for resuscitation at delivery,
neonatal and infant mortality among 28-32 weeks
gestation infants born between 1st April 1999 and
31st March 2002, with and without a clinical diagnosis
of maternal chorioamnionitis. Statistical analysis was
performed with chi-square test. Resuscitation was
defined as use of IPPV by mask or ETT, chest
compression, or drugs for resuscitation.
Results: A total of 1141 live born infants were delivered
at 28-32 weeks gestation during the study period.
Outcome measures are depicted in the table.
Conclusions: A clinical diagnosis of maternal
chorioamnionitis increased the risk of need for
resuscitation suggesting that these infants were born in a
worse clinical condition. However, neonatal and infant
mortality was not affected by a clinical diagnosis of
maternal chorioamnionitis in this preterm cohort.

Background and Aims: Antimicrobial peptides are
present in amniotic fluid and their activities increase
with perinatal infection. Our aim is to examine whether
the maternal steroid treatment affects the antimicrobial
peptides activities in amniotic fluid.
Methods: Amniotic fluids from eleven infants were
examined. Five of all were with maternal steroid and six
without steroid. The gestational ages and birth weights
of the former and later groups were 30 ± 1.8w and 1063
± 391g, 33 ± 2.5w and 1658 ± 625g, respectively.
Maternal betamethazone (12mg) treatments were
intramuscularly carried out twice before birth. The
collected amniotic fluid was adjusted with 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). For enrichment of
proteins/peptides these solutions were passed through
OASIS columns at 4 C and eluted peptides/proteins
were lyophilized. These samples were analyzed for
antimicrobial activity against Bacillus megaterium
(strain Bm11), using an inhibition zone assay.
Lysozyme activity also was examined with Micrococcus
luteus cell walls. LL-37 was measured with ELISA.
Results: The diameters of inhibition zone assay against
Bm11 with and without maternal steroid were 4.8 ± 0.4
and 5.2 ± 0.6mm, respectively, and they were no
significant. There were also no significant in lysozyme
activity between the two groups. On the other hand, the
LL-37 concentrations with maternal steroid were
significantly lower than without one (5.0±2.5;
11.8±6.0ng/ml, p<0.05).
Conclusions: In this study, the maternal steroid
treatment does not strongly seem to affect antimicrobial
peptides activities in amniotic fluid, but partially seem
to affect the peptides that are inductive with
inflammation such as LL-37.

Background and Aims: We carried out a retrospective
study on the decreasing rate of vertically transmitted
(mother to child) HIV infection, after following a
specific protocol.
Methods: Since the year 1997 the protocol consists in:
administering Zidovudin (following the ACTG076
protocol) to both the pregnant woman and the newborn,
programmed cesarean delivery at the 38^ week of
pregnancy and prohibiting breast feeding. A series of
controls were carried out in all newborns from the
moment of birth till the age of 12 months.
Results: From January 1997 to December 2005, we
examined 58 newborn babies; after the first year follow-
up just a child (1,7%) resulted positive for HIV and this
was the child delivered naturally through the vaginal
canal due to a precipitated birth. We analysed and
compared these results with those during the period
from 1994 to 1996 when this protocol was not yet
adopted and it resulted that out of the 36 children
delivered during this period, the HIV virus was
transmitted in 5 (13,9%) cases. A cause to an increase in
premature births in the presence of both HIV and other
sexually or blood transmitted diseases (hepatitis,
condylomatosis, genital herpes, syphilis) as was being
found in 32 pregnant women, i.e. from 13% in women
with only HIV infection to 25% in those with HIV
associated to other diseases.
Conclusions: In conclusion we believe that this protocol
is efficient in modifying the number of vertically
transmitted infections and we therefore sustain that it is
absolutely important carrying out an HIV test in every
pregnant woman.

Background and Aims: Invasive candidiasis is an
important cause of morbidity and mortality in very low
birth weight (VLBW) infants in neonatal intensive care
units. Occasionally, despite administration of
amphotericin B invasive candidiasis is complicated by
persistent fungemia. Caspofungin is a novel antifungal
agent. The experience of caspofungin use is very limited
in neonates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
effectiveness of caspofungin in VLBW (<1500 gr)
infants with persistent candidemia.
Methods: Retrospective analysis of the blood cultures
in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of University of
Patras was performed.
Results: During the last year six VLBW infants
presented with invasive infection from candida species,
five from candida albicans and one from candida
parapsilosis. Initially, liposomal amphotericin was
started in a dose of 4-5 mg/kg/day. Despite the removal
of existing central lines the candidemia persisted in four
infants and caspofungin was added in a dose of 1
mg/kg/day for the first two days and 2 mg/kg/day for the
next days. In two of them with fungal endocarditis
caspofungin was ineffective and replaced with
fluconazole, after 24 and 15 days of treatment,
respectively. In the rest two of the infants the blood
cultures became negative and they received caspofungin
for a total of 4 weeks.
- 169 -
Conclusions: The introduction of new antifungal drugs
could be useful in cases of preterm infants with
persistent fungemia.

Background and Aims: Neonatal bacterial infections
result in considerable morbidity and mortality.
Antibiotics still remain major treatments. Occurrence of
resistant bacterial strains increases every year.
Bacteriophages and antibacterial substances of plant
origin may be considered as alternative medicine. To
examine the epidemiology of neonatal microflora and
study sensitivity of separated strains on antibiotics,
bacteriophages and Tea antibacterials.
Methods: Specimens were collected at Neonatology
Departments of Maternity Hospitals in Tbilisi during 10
months. Smears were collected from Women’s vagina
before labor, from the neonates’ oral cavity and nose
immediately after birth and within 12, 24, 48 and 72
hours. Processing of specimens was performed by
standard bacteriological methods. In some cases
identification was made by API-tests. Sensitivity of the
isolated strains to antibiotics was studied by disc
diffusion method and phage sensitivity – by spot test
followed by titration using double layer method.
Results: 75 bacterial cultures were isolated from 78
mothers and newborns, 57 from them were identified.
The gram-negative bacterial flora (mostly Pseudomonas
aeruginosa) was prevalent in pregnant women, in the
hospital environment and in the neonates in first 48
hours. After 48 hours from birth gram-positive bacteria
(prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus) were revealed.
Resistance to antibiotics was revealed in 72% of strains.
The susceptibility to various bacteriophages (Pyophage,
Intestyphage, Enterophage, SPS-phage) showed high
phage (>50%) and tea antibacterials–sensitivity.
Conclusions: The results demonstrated high potential of
using bacteriophage and Antibacterials of plant origin
preparations for prevention and complex (together with
antibiotics) treatment of bacterial infections.
RETINOPATHY OF PREMATURITY
C C Loureiro, L Winckler
Pediatric Service, Hospital de Santo André, Leiria,
Portugal
Background and Aims: Retinopathy of prematurity
(ROP) is a vasoproliferative retinopathy that might
affect premature children and, in its most severe form,
result in the detachment of the retina and blindness. Our
aim was to characterize the children admitted in our
intermediate care unit (UCEP) with criteria to be
submitted to ROP screen, and the ophthalmologic
evaluation and orientation they were submitted to.
Methods: Descriptive retrospective study involving
children born (in-born/out-born) with gestational age
(GA) 30 week’s and/or with BW 1500g between
July/1999-June/2005, admitted at UCEP. The results
were obtained by means of consultation of the
individual child hospital process.
Results: Of 141 children studied, the GA has varied
between 24 and 37 week’s and the BW balanced
between 470g and 1710g. Eighty six percent of children
were screened and in 14% of cases no screening report
was found. Nineteen percent of screened children had
ROP. Twenty four percent of children with ROP had
BW inferior to 1250g and inferior to 1000g in 36% of
cases. Seventy one percent of ROP cases were stage 1
disease and 21% were stage 2 or greater. Children with
stage 1 ROP disease had a mean GA of 28 week’s with
a mean BW of 1017g while stage 2 ROP mean GA was
26 week’s and the mean BW was 742g. ROP
spontaneous regression has occurred in 70% of cases
and 22% of children developed cicatricial lesion.
Conclusions: ROP prevalence is greater in children
with smaller GA and BW. In most cases of low severity
disease spontaneous resolution has occurred.

Background and Aims: Whenever late-onset sepsis
(LOS) is suspected, empiric anti-microbial therapy
(AMT) is initiated after sepsis work up. To evaluate the
clinical, interventional and laboratory predictors of
LOS, and the appropriateness of empiric AMT in
neonatal LOS.
Methods: Medical records of all neonates admitted to a
tertiary NICU during a 1-year period were reviewed. Of
352 neonates, 84 developed 96 suspected septic events
beyond 3 days of age. LOS definition: clinical signs of
sepsis + positive blood and/or urine and/or CSF culture.
Clinical and laboratory abnormalities at onset of sepsis,
AMT instituted, and microbiological data were
recorded.
Results: Of the 96 events of suspected LOS, 26 (27.0%)
had positive blood cultures, with coagulase-negative
Staphylococcus (CoNS), Klebsiella and Candida
accounting for 22/26 (84.7%) of these events. In four
out of 75 events (5.3%), urine culture was positive.
Logistic regression multivariate analysis showed that
birth weight (OR=0.9, 95%CI: 0.82-0.99; p=0.031),
- 170 -
apnea/bradycardia (OR=3.16, 95%CI: 1.08-9.25;
p=0.036), and platelet count <100,000/mm3 (OR=7.04,
95%CI:1.21-40.9; p=0.03) were significantly associated
with LOS. In 26/29 (89.7%) of proven septic events,
empirical AMT was started after sepsis work up, mostly
vancomycin 18/29 (62.0%), imipenem 14/29 (48.3%),
and amphotericin B 9/29 (31.0%). The causative
pathogen was sensitive to the prescribed AMT in 24/26
(92.3%) of proven septic events.
Conclusions: Significant predictors of LOS include
lower birth weight, apnea/bradycardia and
thrombocytopenia. Empirical AMT was initiated in 90%
of proven septic events and was appropriate in 92.3%.
Empiric coverage of CoNS, Klebsiella and fungi should
be considered, based on infant’s condition and local
microbiological data.

Background and Aims: In UK, there are nationally
agreed guidelines for screening for retinopathy of
prematurity (ROP), treatment thresholds and the
maximum interval between the identification of
threshold disease and treatment. There are no guidelines
for analgaesia or anaesthesia for the baby during
treatment and we are aware of differences in clinical
practise across UK. The present survey was conducted
across UK regional neonatal units (NNU) to evaluate the
management of babies during ROP treatment and to
assess associated problems.
Methods: A questionnaire on anaesthesia for ROP
treatment was sent to 21 regional NNU in UK.
Results: 15 of 21 (71.4%) NNU responded. 5 units
(33.3%) use general anaesthesia (GA) in theatre. 2 units
(13.4%) use sedation and/or local anaesthesia (SLA) in
the NNU. 8 units (53.3%) use sedation, paralysis and
ventilation (SPV) on the NNU. 4 of the 5 units that use
GA in theatre have reported delay in treatment beyond
the recommended time because of lack of theatre
availability. Both units that use SLA on the NNU
reported the need for emergency intubation in some
infants. In the 8 units that used SPV on the NNU, there
were no delays in treatment and the only reported
adverse event was the need for emergency reintubation
in one infant at one centre.
Conclusions: The findings from this survey suggest that
SPV on the NNU provides safe care for babies having
ROP treatment and avoids delays caused by availability
of anaesthetic or theatre resources.

Background and Aims: The retinopathy of prematurity
(ROP) is the first cause of blindness in the infant
population. Many factors have been legated to the
pathogenesis of this illness. Methods: A prospective
study with premature babies of less than 32 weeks and /
or less than 1500 grs was designed. We have determined
every week since the delivery till 39 weeks of corrected
gestational age the seric levels of insulin growth factor
type 1 (IGF1) and the echo-doppler of the central retinal
artery. An ophthalmologic exam was made to check if
ROP was present. Results: 35 patients included, 12 with
retinopathy and 23 with not. Mean weight at delivery
was 1130 grs and 1460 grs respectively (p < 0.05).
There was not difference between both groups in
function of the sex, mean gestational age, childbirth
type, oxygenation time, bronchopulmonary dysplasia,
intracranial haemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus,
erythropoietin treatment and central retinal artery echo-
doppler. Children with retinopathy had more sepsis
(p < 0.05) and lower levels of IGF1. Conclusions: Seric
levels of IGF1 at the 3rd week after delivery are
predictive of ROP (p < 0.05). Low weight at delivery
and sepsis during the first weeks of life are clearly
related with retinopathy. No difference was found in
doppler of central retinal artery, probably due to the
complexity of the technique and its low reproducibility.

Background and Aims: 1. To assess the incidence of
ROP, including severe forms of the disease that required
treatment in preemies included in a regional screening
programme. 2. To assess whether the screening criteria
used in developed countries are appropriate for our
population.
Methods: All babies born Sept 2002 – Dec 2005 with
gestational age (GA) <= 32 weeks and birth weight
(BW) <= 1500 g, plus infants with GA > 32 weeks and
- 171 -
BW > 1500 g with perinatal complicated progress were
included in study.
Results: 884 preemies were examined - 447 (50.5%)
had ROP, 122/884 (13.8%) with severe ROP requiring
laser photocoagulation. The latter had mean ± SEM GA
was 29.2 ± 0,336 wks (range 25 – 33) and mean ± SEM
BW 1245 ± 52 g (range 750 – 1800). In addition, 15
infants presented at the first examination with advanced
stages of ROP (>=4). Among those with ROP, 48/447
(10.7%) had GA > 32 weeks and 113/447 (25.3%) had
BW > 1500 g. Similarly, of those 122/447 (27.3%) with
severe ROP, 7/122 (5.7%) had GA > 32 weeks and
30/122 (24.6%) had BW > 1500 g, in recent months
with an increased incidence of ROP in babies with BW
> 1800 g. These would have been missed if we would
have applied exclusively selection criteria used in
developed countries.
Conclusions: Screening criteria published and used in
the developed countries are too narrow for our
population. We propose the extension of these criteria,
for Romania, to GA <= 34 weeks and BW <= 2000 g.

University of Brussels, Brussels, Belgium
Background and Aims: Oxidative stress (OS) might be
an important contributor to neonatal complications.
Effects of OS on DNA damage are not well documented
in this age group. Aim of the study: To investigate in
vitro DNA damage and repair after OS in healthy term
newborns compared to adults and to analyse the
importance of genotypes in the DNA repair systems.
Methods: Lymphocytes from cord blood and adult
peripheral blood from ten mother-daughter couples were
exposed in vitro to H2O2. Genotoxic effects were tested
using alkaline comet assay and micronucleus assay.
Secondly genotypes of some important repair genes
were defined for all individuals.
Results: Initial DNA damage was similar for neonates
compared to their mothers but because of a better DNA
repair capacity final DNA damage was lower for
newborns. When correlating DNA damage to the
different genotypes, only MTHFR222 variant genotype
had a significant negative effect. The amount of fixed
DNA damage was not significantly different.
Multivariate analysis showed a significant protective
effect of maternal antioxidant supplementation during
pregnancy.
Conclusions: Term newborns tend to have a better
DNA repair capacity after OS compared to adults. A
better knowledge of the influence of the genotypes of
DNA repair genes should allow a better understanding
of individual susceptibility to OS. This is a preliminary
study to assess healthy newborn's sensitivity to DNA
damage after OS. Further studies concerning the
premature infants are planned.

Background and Aims: Antenatal maternal steroid
therapy has been proved to improve the pulmonary
maturation in preterm infants. However, few data on
antioxidant ability have been noted. Our aims are to
evaluate the effects of therapy and delivery modes to
erythrocyte antioxyenzymes activity of preterm infants.
Methods: Prospective study was performed from
June 2001 to May 2002. Preterm infants with gestational
age 25 to 30 weeks were included in this study. Blood
was taken from umbilical arterial line or radial artery
within the first 24 hours. Erythrocytes were collected by
centrifugation and washed with cold saline. Erythrocyte
antioxyenzymes (SOD, catalase, cellular glutathione
peroxidase) activity were measured by Bioxytech SOD-
525, Catalase-520, and GPx-340 and corrected by the
hemoglobin level. Antenatal steroid therapy, mode of
delivery, cumulative oxygen administration, and
patient’s data were collected from chart review. Student
t test and ANOVA were used to evaluate groups of data.
Results: 34 preterm infants were included in our study.
Among them, 16 did and 12 did not receive antenatal
steroid therapy. 6 cases were uncertain. There were no
differences in gestational age, enzyme activity, and
cumulative oxygen administration among the 3 groups.
Birth weight of treatment group was significantly lower
(p=0.015). Of all cases, 9 were vaginal delivery and 25
were caesarean section. The erythrocyte SOD activity
was lower in caesarean section group (p=0.021).
Conclusions: Antenatal maternal steroid therapy didn’t
seem to affect the activity of erythrocyte
antioxyenzymes of preterm infants. Infants delivered
through caesarean section have lower SOD activity,
which may indicate lower oxidative stress.

Background and Aims: To analyze the repercussion
that delivery type (spontaneous vaginal vs Cesarean
section) could have on oxidative stress levels, quantified
by hydroperoxide concentration in erythrocyte
membranes, as well as in the antioxidant catalase
activity in preterm newborns (PTN), in the first week of
life.
Methods: 84 PTN with gestational ages between 26-36
weeks, and birth weight between 630-2500 g. Samples
were obtained from umbilical cord and at 3 h, 72 h and 7
days of life, measuring hydroperoxide membrane levels
(H2O2, ng/ml), as well as the catalase erythrocyte
activity. The preterms were subdivided in two groups:
Group A, 27 neonates born by spontaneous vaginal
delivery and Group B, 57 newborn delivered by
Cesarean section. Statistical analysis: t Student test.
Results: H2O2: We report a greater level of
hydroperoxides in umbilical cord erythrocytes of
preterms delivered by Cesarean section, (p<0,005).
From 3rd h of life, the evolution and levels of H2O2 are
comparable between both groups. Catalase: Major level
of enzymatic catalase activity in preterms borns by
spontaneous vaginal delivery, especially in umbilical
cord and at 3rd h of life, with significant differences
(p<0,005) in umbilical cord.
Conclusions: The birth by Cesarean delivery section
induces a disbalance between oxidative stress levels and
its compensating enzymatic mechanisms in preterms;
that is rapidly compensated in the first hours of life,
presenting later a similar evolution in both delivery
types.

Background and Aims: The knowledge about the
oxidative stress levels in newborn babies of very low
weight (<1500 g at birth) and his evolution in the first
days is still very scarce, for what we realize a
comparative study of the levels of membrane
erythrocyte hydroperoxides in newborns at term and
preterm, analyzing his evolution in the first week of life.
Methods: 147 newborns subdivided in three groups:
Control (CG): 63 newborn at term of weight adequate to
gestational age; group A (GA), 57 very-low-birth-
weight preterms (<1500 g; VLBW); group B (BG): 27
preterm of 1500-2500 g. Blood samples of umbilical
cord and at 3 h of life (in all groups), and at 72 h and 7
days in preterm groups, to quantify membrane
erythrocyte hydroperoxides (H2O2) levels. Statistic:
Two way (groups, hours of life) ANOVA.
Results: H2O2 values minors in the CG that in both
groups of prematures, in umbilical cord and at 3 h of
life, with p<0,005 in both determinations. The evolution
of H2O2 levels in the first 7 days was similar in both
groups of preterms, with mean concentration greater in
the BG and significant differences at 72 h and 7 days.
Conclusions: There are greater levels of oxidative stress
in preterms than at term. Surprisingly, the concentration
is higher in >1500g group than in VLBW group. We
need new studies that extend the knowledge on this fact.

Background and Aims: Single umbilical artery (SUA)
is one of the most frequent congenital malformations in
humans. Associated malformations are usually
diagnosed prenatally or neonatally. Postnatal
development of children with SUA is studied.
Methods: Case-control study. Cases: SUA fetuses
(diagnosed by prenatal ultrasonography) during the
period 2002-2004 in a third level reference Pediatric
hospital. Two matched controls per case (same day,
same ecographist, alleatory match). Data: revision of
clinical records and interview with parents.
Results: 40 Cases, 80 Controls. 15% Cases, 1’49%
Controls died during the prenatal and perinatal period
(all of them diagnosed prenatally as having severe
anomalies). Small for gestational age and intrauterine
growth retardation: 25% Cases, 6’25% Controls. Even
when no associated anomalies were diagnosed, SUA
newborns weighted less. Prematurity: 15’63% Cases,
12’12% Controls. Weight percentile after 1 year of life:
p 49’2 Cases, p 56’35 Controls. Age at walking: 13’61m
Cases, 12’38m Controls; 7’5% of cases could not walk
at 14 months or more (all controls did). Urinary tract
infection (UTI): 10% Cases, 1’47% Controls. A renal
pelvic dilatation detected prenatally, hipospadias and
preauricular appendices diagnosed at birth and a colonic
malformation diagnosed at 2 years of age are found in
the case group. No other malformations are observed
postnatally. Hospital admissions: 20’69% Cases, 8’82%
Controls.
Conclusions: Our study suggests that SUA detected
prenatally is associated with malformations and
perinatal death, low birthweight and prematurity.
Children with an isolated SUA (no associated anomalies
detected) weight less, start walking later and suffer more
UTI and hospital admissions.

Background and Aims: Many neonatal diseases are
associated with oxidative stress. It is likely that
intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is also connected
with the attack of free radicals. We presumed that IUGR
is a consequence of a foetomaternal blood flow disorder.
Red blood cells (RBCs) have specific properties, which
enable them to reach all tissues. The membrane structure
is developed to result in a special shape and elasticity. If
the integrity of the membrane is damaged, RBCs lose
this shape and elasticity and may undergo haemolysis.
Consequently, the tissues obtain less oxygen and
nutriment. Our study deals with lipid peroxidation (LP)
and rheological properties of the RBC membranes.
Methods: 156 full-term mature neonates of either sex,
born between weeks 37 and 40 were included, 127 of
them with normal weight (3425 ± 450g) and 29 neonates
with IUGR (2125 ± 305g). We determined the
erythrocyte ghost damage, the LP and filtration speed of
the RBCs.
Results: LP in the control group was 0.055 nM
MDA/mg protein, while that in the IUGR group was
0.13 nM MDA/mg protein. LP of erythrocyte ghost was
5.9 nM MDA/ml in the control and 9.01 nM MDA/ml in
IUGR group. The rheological parameters of control
neonates had more favourable values than that of IUGR
newborn (relative filtration speed: 0.67 vs. 0.59; cell
transit time: 9.56 vs. 11.69; clogging rate: 5.04 vs. 3.14
×10-3). All differences are significant.
Conclusions: We found a relationship between the LP
in the foetomaternal blood stream and IUGR.

Background and Aims: The gold standard to asses
hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates remains the serum
bilirubin measurement. Unfortunately, this is invasive,
painful, and costly. Bilimed®, a new transcutaneous
bilirubinometer, suggests more accuracy compare to the
existing non-invasive bilirubinometers because of its
new technology, it includes different ethnic skin colors,
does not need contact with the skin during measurement,
and generates no additional costs per measurement. Aim
was to assess the agreement between this new
transcutaneous bilirubinometer and serum bilirubin.
Methods: The Bilimed® was applied on the sternum of
preterm and term infants, including different ethnic
colors of skin. Serum bilirubin concentration was
determined simultaneously. The agreement between
both methods was assessed by the method of Bland-
Altman.
Results: A total of 117 measurements in 99 term
newborn infants (group1), 47 measurements in 37
preterm infants between 34 - 36 6/7 gestational weeks
(group 2) and 21 measurements in 13 preterm infants
between 28 - 33 6/7 gestational weeks (group 3) were
performed. The mean deviation and variability (+/-2SD)
of the transcutaneous values and serum bilirubin in
group 1 were: -14 (+/-144) (figure 1), in group 2: +16
(+/-91) and in group 3: -8 (+/-76) mcmol/l. Although
most points lie within the limits of agreement, these
limits are too wide to be acceptable in a clinical setting.
Moreover, there seems to be a trend towards less good
agreement with increasing bilirubin values.
Conclusions: Despite its new technology the new
transcutaneous bilirubinometer has no considerable
advantages, and more specifically no greater agreement
compared to the existing non invasive bilirubinometer.

Gurion University of The Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel
Background and Aims: In the absence of a measure for
assessing the incidence or severity of post-discharge
bilirubin morbidity, surveillance of the rate of hospital
readmission has been suggested to assess this potential.
Methods: The rate of readmission for neonatal
hyperbilirubinemia was determined in term and near-
term neonates cared for in the well baby nurseries of the
Shaare Zedek Medical Center. Severity of
hyperbilirubinemia and etiological categories were
compared between those who required phototherapy
either during birth hospitalization or readmission.
Results: During 2001-2002 there were 19,437 live
births, of whom 342 (1.8%) were treated with
phototherapy. 74 of these (0.38% of total) were
readmitted for primary phototherapy. Mean ± SD
plasma total bilirubin at onset of phototherapy was 14.7
± 3.0 mg/dL (upper range 21.0 mg/dL) in the birth
hospitalized neonates and 18.5 ± 1.7 mg/dL (upper
range 26.0 mg/dL) in those readmitted (p<0.0001). Four
required exchange transfusion (3 during birth
hospitalization and 1 readmitted). Mean weight change
from birth to readmission was -3.5 ± 1.7%. Among
those treated during the birth hospitalization the
majority had a hemolytic etiology for their jaundice
whereas in 52% of the readmitted neonates breast
feeding was the only identifiable risk factor. No infant
in either group had signs of bilirubin encephalopathy.
Conclusions: Potentially severe post-discharge
hyperbilirubinemia requiring readmission may occur in
the absence of identifiable predictive risk factors other
than breastfeeding. All neonates should be vigilantly
observed for hyperbilirubinemia in the immediate post-
discharge period.

Background and Aims: A salient feature of recent
guidelines for the management of neonatal
hyperbilirubinemia is the assessment of risk for severe
hyperbilirubinemia in part by means of evaluation of
clinical risk factors. However, clinical risk factors are
not apparent in many cases with severe
hyperbilirubinemia. Objective: To analyze the
incidence, etiology, treatment, and outcome of term and
near-term newborns (GA 35) with bilirubin levels 20
mg/dl.
Methods: Newborns were identified using computer
databases from a cohort of 14,129 infants (1998-2005).
Data on clinical manifestations, etiology, treatment, and
follow-up were obtained.
Results: 78 newborns had bilirubin levels 20 mg/dl
(5.5 in 1000 newborn infants); none 29 mg/dl. No
acute neurological symptoms were observed in any
infant. One required exchange transfusion. A cause for
hyperbilirubinemia was identified in 37 infants (47%):
14 isoimmunization (9 O/A, 4 O/B, 1 Rh), 9
dehydration, 2 infection, 3 neonatal hepatic disease, 9
other. Most infants did not require in-hospital follow-up;
among those followed, 5 showed unexpected elevation
of transaminases, 2 of them had alfa1-antitrypsin
deficiency (Pi:MS, Pi:MZ). No differences were found
between infants with and without identified cause for
gestational age, maximum bilirubin, and days of
phototherapy; birth weight was lower in infants with
identified cause (2952±364 vs 3189±482, p<0.05).
Conclusions: 1) Unrecognized mild alterations in the
metabolism of bilirubin might underlie significant
hyperbilirubinemia without apparent cause. Follow-up
including hepatic function tests might help to identify
families at risk for severe hyperbilirubinemia of genetic
origin. 2) Adequate management of known risk factors,
such as Rh isoimmunization, precludes severe
hyperbilirubinemia in these infants.
VALIDATING A COMPUTER TOOL WHICH
HELPS TO USE THE AAP GUIDELINE ON
HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA

Unitat de Neonatología Hospital Sant Joan de Reus,
Reus, Spain
Background and Aims: The AAP guidelines for
evaluating the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia in the
newborn changed in 2004. The clinical decision to
initiate treatment with phototherapy or exchange
transfusion is subject to many errors. Objectives Aware
of this problem, we designed a spreadsheet (NeoBili),
which helps to interpret bilirubin levels according to the
infant’s age in hours and helps to take into account the
clinical risk factors.
Methods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted
with simulated clinical cases. In this preliminary study,
one hundred and eighty simulated cases were performed
by two groups, one of paediatricians and another of
paediatric residents. The main variables measured were
the number of errors (“minor” and “major”) and the time
taken to make the decision.
Results: Without computer support, 32 “minor” errors
out of 90 cases were made. The number of errors
decreased to 13 when NeoBili was used (p=0.002).
Major errors also decreased when the computer was
used (from 6 to 2 out of 90 simulations), although this
difference was not significant (p=0.27). As far as the
time taken to make the decision, the group of paediatric
was the one that benefited most from using the
computer: the time taken to solve 10 cases reduced from
16.25 min. to 10.5 min.
Conclusions: The test we carried out with simulated
clinical cases shows that many errors are made in the
management of hyperbilirubinemia. Neobili helped
clinicians to make fewer errors and also saved them
time.

Background and Aims: Neonatal jaundice (NJ) is a
common condition and usually a benign transitional
event that resolves without treatment. The aim of this
study was to determine the correlation of gender and
mode of delivery with the values of bilirubin in healthy
full- term neonates.
Methods: Serum total bilirubin (TSB) measurements
were initially made at the 24th hour of life and repeated
daily for the next 4 days) in 198 full-term healthy breast
feeding newborns born in a regional hospital and
correlated with gender and mode of delivery. (n=198,
males=104- females=94, median Birth Weight = 3230
g).
Results: Clinically detectable jaundice was present in
177 (84.8%) newborns. When comparing males with
females, differences were detected in max TSB (6.74 +/-
2.8 vs. 7.56 +/- 2.3 mg%). TSB level of 6 mg/dl at 24
+/- 6 hr was presented in 50 (25.2%) infants. Of these
29 (58%) were females and 21 (42%) males, and 30
(60%) were born after spontaneous delivery and 20
(40%) after caesarean section and 9 (18%) were defined
to have significant hyperbilirubinemia, and
phototherapy treatment was started. Compared with
newborns not noted to be jaundiced on the first day,
newborns noted to be jaundiced within 24 hours were
more likely to receive phototherapy (18% vs. 1.2%).
- 175 -
Conclusions: Maximum value of TSB in our sample
was higher in females when compared with males.
Although no differences were detected in mode of
gestation of total sample, spontaneous delivery
correlated with influencing of TSB on the first day.
THE IMPACT OF BACTERIEMIA ON JAUNDICE
WHICH REQUIRED EXCHANGE TRANSFUSION
IN NEONATES
N Tekin, A Aksit
Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology,
Eskisehir Osmangazi University Medical Faculty,
Eskisehir, Turkey
Background and Aims: In recent years the need for
exchange transfusion in neonatal jaundice was
decreased with improvement in perinatal care in Turkey.
Rh incompatibility cases reduced while the cases with
unknown etiology increased. This study was designed to
evaluate the incidence of bacteriemia in the infants who
received exchange transfusion in the last two years.
Methods: This study was performed in Osmangazi
University Medical Faculty Hospital which is a tertiary
level perinatal center. We reviewed the charts of the
infants with a gestational age >/= 36 weeks who
received exchange transfusion for indirect
hyperbilirubinemia. Sixty one infants were found
suitable for evaluation from January 2004 to November
2005. Mean gestational age was 39.1±1.31 weeks, and
birth weight was 3187.5±573.63 grams. As our routine
procedure, blood cultures of all the infants were taken
before and after the exchange transfusion and antibiotic
treatment were started.
Results: Mean value of bilirubin level was 26.69± 6.48
on admission who received exchange transfusion.
Sixteen infants had a positive coombs test with ABO
incompatibility in 9 and Rh incompatibility in 6 of them.
In remaining 45 infants, pathogen microorganisms were
detected in 22 of the blood cultures taken just before the
exchange transfusion, S aureus was the most common
one. None of the infants had clinical evidence of
infection and the mean duration of hospital stay was
5.47±3.2.
Conclusions: We suggested that the infection could be
the triggering factor for hyperbilirubinemia and
treatment with exchange transfusion in the early,
asymptomatic stage of infection prevented the
progression of disease.
A CASE OF RHIZOMELIC
CHONDRODYSPLASIA PUNCTATA, TYPE I

Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology,
Eskisehir Osmangazi University Medical Faculty,
Eskisehir, Turkey
Background and Aims: To report a case of rhizomelic
chondrodysplasia punctata and discuss differential
diagnosis of this rare condition from other
chondrodysplasias.
Methods: A 12-day-old male infant whose
anthropometric measurements all below the 10th
percentile presented with respiratory distress. He had
rhizomelic micromelia, joint contractures, pes
equinovarus deformity and bilateral cataracts, low grade
systolic heart murmur on physical examination and
roentgenogram showed short humerus and femur,
punctate calcifications and abnormal ossification in
metaphyses and epiphysis. Echocardiography revealed
secundum ASD and PDA.
Results: Presence of short humerus and femur, punctate
calcification of the cartilage, congenital cataracts and
respiratory problems are satisfactory for clinical
diagnosis and to distinguish from other types of punctate
calcifications such as X linked chondrodysplasia
punctata, the multiple forms of Zellweger syndrome,
maternal ingestion of certain anticoagulants in early
pregnancy.
Conclusions: Rhizomelic form of chondrodysplasia
punctata is a rare multisystem peroxisomal disorder.
Usually diagnosis is based on clinical and radiological
criteria, but demonstrating biochemical abnormalities;
impairment of plasmalogen biosythesis and elevated
phytanic acid will be helpful to assess the underlying
mechanism.

Background and Aims: Walker-Warburg syndrome is
characterised by congenital muscular dystrophy in
conjunction with severe brain malformations and ocular
abnormalities. Also known as HARD +/- E syndrome
hydrocephalous (H). Agyria (A), retinal dysplasia (RD)
with or without encephaloceole (+/-E) the condition is
usually lethal within the first few months of life. This
extremely rare autosomal recessive congenital muscular
dystrophy is one of more than 35 genetic conditions now
known to occur in the highly consanguineous Irish
Traveller Population.
Methods: We report a family (including a detailed
family pedigree) from the Irish Traveller Community
who have 2 infants diagnosed with the
dystroglycanopathy; 4 of mother's siblings were also
affected.
Results: The genotype (POMT1 mutation) and
phenotype are described.
Conclusions: Identification of the unique mutation in
this ethnic group allows timely prenatal diagnosis,
management and genetic counselling.

Department of Pediatric Surgery,
Pediatric Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Italy
Background and Aims: Hepatic tumors in children are
uncommon (2-3% of pediatric tumors). However,
infantile hemangioendothelioma is the most frequent
benign vascular liver tumor in infancy. Although they
are usually benign tumors, they may be life-threatening
if haemodynamic or hematologic complications are
associated.
Methods: Case report.
Results: A preterm newborn (35 g.e.) presented with a
neonatal depression and palpable abdominal mass. The
patient had signs of heart failure, anemia (hematocrito
33%) and thrombocytopenia (59.000 platelets/mm3);
coagulation tests proved Quick index of 43%. Serum -
fetoprotein level was 9451 ng/mL. Angio-magnectic
resonance demonstrated a left intraperitoneal tumor in
close relationship with the left hepatic lobe. Vascular
study showed involvement of celliaco trunk and upper
mesenteryc artery and drainage by dilated suprahepatic
left vein. The tumor was completely removed surgically.
It was necessary to resect the left hepatic lobe and
transverse colon. Macroscopy view showed a gray-red
exophytic tumor and an arterio-venous malformation.
Histologic analysis demonstrated hemangiondothelioma
with necrotic areas and not infiltrated limits. Fifteen
days after surgery the patient presented acholic
depositions, jaundice and hypertransaminasemia, study
slope.
Conclusions: Most of these tumors spontaneously
regress. Patients with small lesions don't need treatment,
but those with big size tumors or symptomatic require
aggressive management with surgical or medical
treatment (steroids, alpha-interferon or vincristine). In
this case, surgical resection was indicated because of
haemodynamic inestability and tumor size. Despite the
benign histological findings of these tumors, some
hemangioendotheliomes can develop malignant
behaviour, so a long term follow-up is important for the
evolution of treatment response.
AUDIT OF TRISOMY 13 AND 18 CASES OVER A
TEN YEAR PERIOD IN IRELAND
N Ni Shuibhne, R Howell, A J Green, S A Lynch
The National Centre for Medical Genetics, Our Lady's
Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin, Ireland
Background and Aims: In Western Europe the
majority of cases of trisomy 13 and 18 are detected
antenatally through routine anomaly ultrasound
screening. Routine screening is not uniform in Ireland
and antenatal detection is much lower.
Methods: We performed an audit of cases of trisomy 13
and 18 made by our Cytogenetics department from
1995-2005.
Results: There were 90 cases of Trisomy 13 diagnosed
from 1995-2005. Of these only 28 were diagnosed by
amniocentesis and three by chorionic villus sampling
(CVS). There were twelve cases of trisomy 13 during
that time period seen by clinical geneticists. Of these
cases, the mean maternal age was 36 years. Five had
abnormal antenatal ultrasounds, mean birth weight was
2.4kg, mean gestation 30/40, two had caesarean sections
and survival ranged from three days to two months.
There were 177 cases of trisomy 18seen in the same
period of ten years. Of these 77 were diagnosed through
amniocentesis and four cases through CVS. There were
16 cases of Trisomy 18 seen by clinical geneticists. The
mean maternal age was 33 years. Only two babies had
evidence of intrauterine growth retardation on antenatal
ultrasound. Mean birth weight was 1.7kg, mean
gestation 37/40, four babies had caesarean sections and
survival ranged from one hour to two weeks.
Conclusions: Antenatal detection of trisomy 13 and 18
is still low in Ireland. Antenatal detection can facilitate
conservative management. We recommend offering
routine antenatal anomaly ultrasound scan at mid-
gestation.

Background and Aims: Infants of diabetic mothers
(IDMs) frequently feed less well than normal
counterparts. Our goal was to evaluate sucking patterns
in IDMs to objectively demonstrate any difference in
these patterns.
Methods: Term healthy IDMs whose mothers were
managed with either insulin or diet alone (insulin and
diet groups respectively) were compared to matched
normal infants (control group). Sucking parameters were
recorded over 5 minutes’ bottle feedings with the Kron’s
Apparatus on the third day of life. Student’s t-test was
used to compare continuous variables and X2 test for
categorical variables.
Results: The study included 47 IDMs (16 insulin group
and 31 diet group) and 55 normal infants (control
group). There were significant differences in the total
number of sucks and total number of bursts between the
insulin and the control groups (table 1). The insulin
group averaged 5.2 fewer bursts and 42 fewer sucks
(P=0.013 and P=0.04 respectively). However, there
were no differences between the diet and the control
groups.
Conclusions: A poorer feeding performance was found
among infants of the insulin group but not of the diet
group. This poorer performance during the early
neonatal period may have been due to immaturity of the
sucking mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this
- 177 -
is the first report of nutritive sucking behavior in IDMs.
NUTRIENT DEFICITS IN VLBW INFANTS:
CURRENT NUTRITION PRACTICE IS NOT
GOOD ENOUGH

A Urs, M Vaithianathan
Neonatal Unit, Leicester Royal Infirmary, University
Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Leicester, UK
Background and Aims: Under nutrition and extra
uterine growth restriction is a major problem in very low
birth weight (VLBW) infants. We evaluated daily
nutrient intake in VLBW infants during first four weeks
of life and compared with the recommended dietary
intake (RDI) to quantify nutrient deficits accrued in the
neonatal period.
Methods: Daily nutrient intakes were analysed in
VLBW infants (birth weight 1250g) admitted to our
NICU between 01/01/05 and 31/12/05. Neonates with
major congenital malformations and abdominal surgical
problems were excluded. Actual intake of calories and
protein (both enteral and parenteral) was subtracted
from RDI (120Kcal/kg/day, 3.8 g of protein/kg/day) and
nutritional deficits calculated. Data are expressed as
mean ± standard deviation.
Results: During the study period, 47 infants (birth
weight 926±49.5g; gestational age 28±3.5 weeks) were
eligible for inclusion. The weekly and cumulative
energy and protein intakes and deficits during the
neonatal period are depicted in the table.
Conclusions: Our results corroborate previous evidence
that current nutrition practice leads to significant
nutrient deficits in VLBW infants. Although there was
progressive improvement, deficits were still significant,
especially for protein. Since sub-optimal nutrition may
be rate limiting on clinical outcome, there is urgent need
to evaluate and practice more aggressive nutritional
management in this fragile population.

Background and Aims: Several studies have described
reduced plasma concentrations of arginine, the substrate
for nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in infants with
necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). It is currently not
known what the level of the plasma concentrations of
the endogenous NOS inhibitor asymmetric
dimethylarginine (ADMA) is in patients with NEC. We
investigated whether plasma concentrations of arginine,
ADMA and their ratio differ between premature infants
with and without NEC, and within the NEC group
between survivors and non-survivors.
Methods: In a prospective case-control study, arginine,
and ADMA concentrations were measured in 10
premature infants with NEC (mean (SD) gestational age
197 (15) days, birthweight 1089 (367) g), and 10
matched control infants (gestational age 201 (14) days,
birthweight 1063 (209) g), admitted to the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit.
Results: In the premature infants with NEC, arginine
and ADMA concentrations, and the arginine/ADMA
ratio were lower, compared to infants without NEC:
median 21.40 vs 48.15, p=0.001; 0.587 vs 0.821,
p=0.015; and 36.55 vs 68.82, p=0.023 respectively. In
the NEC group, arginine and the arginine/ADMA ratio
were lower in non-surviving than in surviving infants:
median 14.65 vs 33.75, p=0.01; and 32.02 vs 47.47,
p=0.038 respectively.
Conclusions: In premature infants with NEC not only
the NOS substrate arginine, but also the endogenous
NOS inhibitor ADMA and the arginine/ADMA ratio are
lower than in infants without NEC. In addition, a low
arginine and arginine/ADMA ratio are associated with
mortality in infants with NEC. A diminished nitric oxide
production may be involved in the pathology of NEC.

Background and Aims: Necrotizing Enterocolitis
(NEC) is a worrisome acquired gastrointestinal disease
in VLBWI. We aim to monitor the population
epidemiology and clinical outcomes of NEC in VLBWI.
Methods: The National Registry of VLBWI Database
(1996-2004) was used for NEC-related morbidity and
mortality risk analysis. Bell’s stage II-III cases were
considered.
Results: In 1996-2004, 8567 VLBWI (2952 ELBWI)
were registered in Portugal. The incidence of NEC was
765 VLBWI (8,3%), 324 with NEC II-III (3,8%), 194
among ELBWI (6,6%). While global incidence of NEC
and NEC II-III showed a wide annual variation,
incidence of NEC IIIb significantly reduced (r=-0,73).
There was significant association of NEC II-III to
gestational age <30 weeks, birth weight <1000g,
umbilical arterial catheter and indometacin
administration. 111 (34,4%) of NEC II-III cases were
submitted to surgery. NEC caused death of 0,95% of the
VLBWI and 2% of ELBWI. Lethality in stages II-III
was 25% and 43% in stage IIIb. The lethality observed
in the newborns with stage IIIb was reduced to 36,5%
when submitted to surgery (RR 0,63; 95%CI 0,43-0,92).
The risk of death was 49% for NEC IIIb ELBWI, but it
lowered to 39% when submitted to surgical intervention
(RR 0,56; 95%CI 0,38-0,82).
Conclusions: Data from a complete national
population-based dataset certainly explain differences
from previous studies based exclusively on VLBWI
treated in level III NICU. A reduction of the incidence
of NEC IIIb is apparent. The reduction of the death risk
among grade IIIb ELBWI when submitted to surgery
denotes the importance of early diagnosis and
intervention.

Background and Aims: The preterm infant frequently
experiences oral feeding difficulties, because of brain
stem immaturity and oral disorders due to inadequate
oral stimulations in neonatal period (poor and painful
stimuli). Oral stimulations before feeding or oral support
measures seem to enhance suck and swallow
coordination of the preterm infant. The aim of our study
was to assess the beneficial effects of oral stimulation
and support on preterm sucking performance.
Methods: 51 preterm infants born before 34 weeks
gestationnel age were randomised into 3 experimental
groups according to oral stimulation program and oral
support measures, realised independently or combined,
and control group. The oral stimulation program was
administered once per day for 14 consecutive days,
before tube enteral feeding then the bottle feeding was
introduced. Oral support was administered once per day,
during transition from tube to independent oral feeding.
Suction’s strength (exprimed in mmHg) and frequency
(measured in percentage of all sucking burst length
during the entire recording) were regularly evaluated by
a pressure transducer.
Results: The sucking strength increased significantly
(cf. graph) and sucking rate had a tendency to increase
(p=0.1). These effects were earlier and longer in the
time when oral stimulation program and oral support
measures were associated.
Conclusions: A prefeeding oral stimulation program
and oral support measures, provided combined or
indepedently, enhance sucking performance of preterm
infant in regard to sucking strength and frequency.
DIAPHRAGMATIC ENDURANCE FOLLOWING
ABDOMINAL DEFECT REPAIR IN
GASTROSCHISIS INFANTS
G Dimitriou, C Agakidis, G F Rafferty, A Greenough
Division of Asthma, Allergy and Lung Biology, Guy’s,
King’s and St Thomas’ Medical School, London, UK
Background and Aims: It has been shown that
diaphragmatic strength postoperatively is impaired in
infants with gastroschisis. Diaphragmatic tension-time
index (TTdi), which describes the pressure-generating
activity of the diaphragm, is a measure of diaphragmatic
endurance and hence a high TTdi can predict
diaphragmatic fatigue. The aim of this study was to test
the hypothesis that infants who had surgical repair of
gastroschisis would have impaired diaphragmatic
endurance.
Methods: Twenty gastroschisis and twenty control
infants, median gestational age 37 weeks were studied.
TTdi was assessed in gastroschisis infants and controls
matched to gestational age. TTdi was calculated as the
product of the mean to the maximum transdiaphragmatic
pressure (Pdimean/Pdimax) and the inspiratory duty
cycle (Ti/Ttot). Transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) was
calculated by subtraction of oesophageal from gastric
pressure measured using a Gaeltec dual pressure
catheter during quiet breathing. The Pdimean during a
breath was electronically determined over the
inspiratory time interval where the Pdimax was the
largest transdiaphragmatic pressure generated during
airway occlusions performed at the end of a crying
effort. The inspiratory duty cycle was calculated using
the oesophageal and transdiaphragmatic pressure
signals.
Results: The gastroschisis infants had higher TTdi than
the controls (median 0.053 range 0.026 to 0.081 versus
median 0.040, median 0.022 to 0.084, respectively, p =
0.0186).
- 179 -
Conclusions: These results suggest that shortly after the
abdominal wall repair, gastroschisis infants have
impaired diaphragmatic endurance.

Hospital, Athens, Greece
Background and Aims: The aim of the study was to
evaluate the effect of Glutamine supplementation on the
intestinal permeability of preterm infants and
contribution to growth. Methods: In a prospective
randomized study, 74 healthy premature neonates of less
than 2000gr. birth weight, born at gestational age of 26
– 34 weeks, were included. Fourty one neonates
(Glutamine group) received a preterm formula,
supplemented with Glutamine 0,3gr. per kg, whereas the
other thirty four neonates were fed with non
supplemented formula (control group).
Lactulose/mannitol excretion ratio in urine samples was
used to measure the intestinal permeability and was
performed three times: a) at birth b) at the age of 7days
c) at the age of 1-month. Results: There was no
signifact difference in anthropometric measurements
between the two groups, at the time of birth. At the age
of 1-month, the head circumference and the weight were
statistically higher in Glutamine group: (HC p < 0,001)
(WG p= 0,001) as compared to the control group. The
L/M ratio, although lower in the Glutamine group, did
not reach however statistical significancy (p = 0,392).
Conclusions: The administration of Glutamine leads to
significant increase of the anthropometric parameters
and to lower intestinal permeability. Further studies will
be needed using higher doses of glutamine in order to
confirm preliminary results.

London, UK
Background and Aims: Abdominal distension in
severe necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) may cause an
abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). In other
scenarios (e.g. abdominal trauma) multi-organ failure
(MOF) is accelerated by a reduction in venous return
and increased systemic vascular resistance secondary to
the ACS. While semi-elective abdominal drainage is a
recognised approach to perforated NEC, the acute
haemodynamic impact of emergency abdominal
drainage (EAD) has not been reported. We hypothesised
that ACS can be a contributor to the MOF of NEC and
that EAD improves cardiorespiratory function
immediately in these most severely ill premature infants.
Methods: Six infants (corrected gestation 25-33 weeks,
weight 0.77-2.2Kg) with stage III NEC, and profound
cardiorespiratory failure (despite volume resuscitation >
60ml/kg, epinephrine > 0.5 mcg/kg/min) on admission
had clinical ACS and underwent EAD. Cardiac Index
(cardiac output/body surface area) was assessed with the
non-invasive USCOM device immediately prior to and
within 6 min of drainage. Oxygenation index
(OI =FiO2xMean Airway Pressure/PaO2) was noted
before and <60 min after drainage. Results: Emergency
abdominal drainage was associated with a rapid
improvement in cardio-respiratory status in each case
without other interventions. Initial measures of cardiac
index were low in every case but increased by 71-283%,
(p=0.03 Wilcoxon signed ranks, Figure). High initial
oxygenation index values (median 56), fell by between
27-56%, (p=0.03. Wilcoxon signed ranks).
Conclusions: Abdominal compartment syndrome
contributes to the severity of multiple organ failure in
severe NEC. Emergency abdominal drainage is
associated with an immediate improvement in
cardiorespiratory status.

Background and Aims: The aim of the study was to
evaluate the effect of Bifidobacterium lactis
supplementation on the intestinal permeability of
preterm infants and its contribution to growth.
Methods: In a prospective randomized study, 75
healthy premature neonates of less than 2000 gr. birth
weight, born at gestational age of 26-36 weeks, were
included. Forty-one neonates (probiotic group) received
a preterm formula to which B.lactis was added, whereas
the other thirty-four neonates were fed with an un-
supplemented pre-term formula (control group). The
intestinal permeability was examined three times using a
sugar permeability absorption test, by introducing orally
mannitol and lactulose and assessing their concentration
in urine samples: a) at birth b) seven days after the
initiation of feeding and, c) at the age of 1 month or 21-
25 days after the onset of enteral feeding.
- 180 -
Results: Head circumference was statistically higher in
infants receiving probiotic (P=0,001) at the age of one
month. Between groups, comparison showed that L/M
ratio in the probiotic group was significantly lower in
comparison with the control group (p=0,003) due to
decrease in lactulose absorption from the gut.
Conclusions: The administration of the probiotic
B.lactis to preterm leads to significant decrease of
intestinal permeability (or increase of the gut barrier).
This could be one of the mechanisms through which
probiotics reduce bacterial translocation and allergic
disease.
NEONATAL DEHYDRATION - WHY
INCREASING INCIDENCE?
M Reilev, O Pryds, K Børch
Department of Childcare, Hvidovre Hospital, Hvidovre,
Denmark
Background and Aims: Neonatal dehydration with
hypernatraemia is a serious condition with risk of
cerebral damage and death. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the incidence of dehydration among readmitted
neonates and to determine related complications.
Methods: A retrospective study was conducted at
Hvidovre Hospital over a 5-year period to identify term
or near-term infants (>35 weeks of gestation) who were
admitted with a weight loss >10%. Infants admitted
between the third and the 14th day of life having a
discharge diagnosis code indicating dehydration were
included.
Results: During the period a total of 89 infants were
admitted with dehydration -24 had hypernatraemia.
They were born primarily to primiparous women
(72.3%) and 9 were heavy for gestational age (HGA).
All were breastfed and only three received
supplementation prior to readmission. The weight loss
ranged between 270 and 1100 grams (corresponding to
10.1–29.7% of birth weight) with a serum sodium
concentration being proportionally related to the relative
weight loss (range: 135-175 mmol/l). Lethargy and
jaundice were frequent symptoms. Cerebral
complications occurred for eight infants and two
developed permanent brain damage. There were no
deaths. The incidence of dehydration increased from 2.1
to 4.9 during the period.
Conclusions: Breastfeeding should be encouraged but
supplementation may be necessary for some neonates.
Infants born to primiparous women and HGA infants
need special attention. Infants at risk could be identified
by regular weighing from day 4 – 5 at latest.
Supplementation and follow-up should be instituted if
necessary.
INTESTINAL PROTECTION BY ACTIVATION
OF PPAR GAMMA

Department of Neonatology, Charité Campus Mitte,
Berlin, Germany
Background and Aims: Prematurity remains the main
but less understood risk factor for necrotising
enterocolitis (NEC) – the most devastating intestinal
emergency in premature infants. The molecular
mechanisms of immaturity are still unclear, nutrition
with breast milk is known to act prophylactic. We aimed
to specify prophylactic peptides, which are
developmentally expressed, and induced by activation of
transcriptional factor PPARg.
Methods: Intestinal expression of haeme oxygenase-1
(HO-1), and treefoil factor 3 (TFF3) was measured by
quantitative PCR and western blot analysis in rats before
(d18, d20 post conceptionem), and after birth (d2 p.n.)
comparing the effects of PPARg activation (oral
application of Pioglitazone to the mother). Early
enterocolitis was induced in dam-fed newborn rats by
hypercapnia/reoxygenation (H/R) in Pioglitazone treated
animals. Capase 3 activation was detected
calorimetically.
Results: Unlike to d18 rats we found a significant
increase in intestinal TFF3 expression after PPARg
activation in d20 rats. 48 h after H/R we saw an
anctivtion of Caspase 3 in dam fed animals. This effect
could be abrogated by maternal application of
Pioglitazone, and was associated with an increase in
HO-1 expression in newborn rats.
Conclusions: Oral application of Pioglitazone to rats
during pregnancy provides an effective strategy to
induce intestinal TFF3, which is known to act protective
in the intestine. After birth PPARg activation induces a
rise in HO-1 expression and ameliorates harming effects
of H/R. By this Pioglitazone acts protective via two
peptides and could reveal a new strategy in the
prevention of NEC.

difference was found between breast milk leptin, insulin,
GH ve IGF concentrations before and after feeding.
However, the mean fasting breast milk ghrelin
concentration was higher than postprandial levels
(mean±SD; 1215,2 ± 692,2 pg/mL vs 785,2 ± 666,7
- 181 -
pg/mL) (p<0.05). Postprandial serum GH, IGF and
insulin levels were higher than fasting levels in both
groups (p<0.05). Fasting serum ghrelin concentrations
(2515,9 ± 592,2 pg/mL) were higher than postprandial
serum concentrations (951,2 ± 384,2 pg/mL) (p=0.000)
in breastfed infants. No difference was found between
the serum concentrations of ghrelin before and after
feeding (1639,1 ± 435,7 pg/mL vs 1427,2 ±365,4
pg/mL, respectively) in formula fed infants (p>0.05). In
both groups, fasting and postprandial serum leptin levels
were similar (p>0.05).
Conclusions: It is concluded that ghrelin but not leptin
seems to be an important factor for stimulating feeding.
It is also an interesting finding that formula feeding did
not affect serum ghrelin levels in contrast to breast
feeding.

Hospital, Oxford, UK
Background and Aims: Epidermal growth factor
(EGF) is an amino acid polypeptide that has been shown
to promote mucosal healing and intestinal growth in
experimental models and has a potential role in the
aetiology and treatment of NEC. We have previously
shown that EGF measurement in saliva was relatively
consistent and reproducible as compared to other bodily
fluids. The aim of this study was to determine the
normal levels of salivary EGF in a cohort of pre-term
infants.
Methods: With appropriate ethical approval and
informed consent, saliva was collected using a suction
catheter from all normal pre-term infants admitted to our
unit over a 9 month period. The samples were
immediately frozen at -20 C and analysed using an
ELISA assay. All results are expressed as mean values
with standard deviation.
Results: A total of 60 samples were collected and
analysed from 25 babies. The mean gestation and weight
of the patients was 32.2 (+/-5.50) weeks and 1954.44
(+/-1045.7) grams respectively. None of the patients had
clinical or serum markers of sepsis or NEC. All infants
were given maternal breast milk started at the mean age
of 5 (+/-3.47) days. The mean EGF values were 676.95
(+/-168.47) pg/ml. There was no correlation between the
EGF values and differences in gestation, birth weight or
timing of initiating enteral feeds.
Conclusions: This study provides a useful baseline of
salivary EGF values in normal pre-term infants. This
data may have important implications for understanding
the aetiology of NEC and in the design of novel
therapies for this condition.

Background and Aims: To reduce mean duration of
time taken for VLBW infants (birth weight < 1500
grams) to attain a weight of 2 kg, by 15% over 6
months.
Methods: A multidisciplinary team involving
neonatologists, nurse managers and dietitian was
formed. Nutritional interventions were introduced based
on evidence in the literature. New parenteral nutrition
policies (early initiation of total parenteral nutrition,
rapid advancement of amino-acids, lipids, glucose) and
new enteral nutrition policies (standardization of
definition of minimal enteral nutrition, revision of rate
of feed increment, encouragement of use of breast milk,
introduction of ad-lib feeding, use of preterm milk
formula instead of term milk formula when breast milk
was not available) were implemented using a clinical
pathway in December 2004. An audit on the clinical
pathway was carried out from December 2004 to
May 2005.
Results: 59 VLBWs were enrolled in study. Mean
weights on days 14 and 21 showed an improving trend
indicating a possible effect of revised parenteral and
enteral nutrition policies. There was a 21% reduction in
the time taken to reach a discharge weight of 2kg (60
days versus 47.6 days). The incidence of necrotising
entercolitis remained low despite more aggressive
enteral feeding guidelines.
Conclusions: We achieved a 21% reduction in the time
taken to achieve a weight of 2 kg. Early discharge
means a shortened length of stay, reducing cost of
hospitalization. Good nutrition ensures a good start in
life for this group of vulnerable infants. The use of
evidence-based medicine and a multidisciplinary
approach helped to improve our clinical practice.

Background and Aims: Gastrotonometry, a method
developed for the measurement of the partial pressure of
carbon dioxide (PgCO2) in the gastrointestinal tract.
The main field of application is to monitor the condition
of patients in critical states. Although it is widely
applied in adult intensive care, its use is limited in
paediatrics. Our main aim was to develop a method with
- 182 -
which gastrotonometric examinations can be performed
on neonates and infants, without difficulties.
Methods: A newly developed balloon-free probe was
used. 29 neonates and infants requiring intensive care
were monitored (age: 2 - 456 days, weight: 1200 -
6700g). Paediatric Index of Mortality scores, PCO2 gap
values, acid base parameters and intramucosal pH
values were measured/calculated. Results of surviving
and non-surviving patients were compared with
unpaired, two-tailed Student’s test.
Results: Examinations could be easily performed. Out
of the 29 patients 7 died. PIM scores (35.1 ± 19.6%
versus 14.6 ± 14.8%), as well as PCO2 gap values
(13.48 ± 9.30 mmHg versus 8.43 ± 6.54mHg) and
systemic-intramucosal pH differences (0.124 ± 0.074
versus 0.079 ± 0.054) were significantly higher in the
non-surviving group of patients.
Conclusions: The new gastrotonometric probe is easily
applicable even in infants. Residents and nurses can
perform the examinations, too. Worsening
gastrotonometric parameters may predict adverse
outcome.

Background and Aims: Classical risk factors for
necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) are prematurity,
hypoxia/ischemia, cardiac malformation, anaemia, and
formula feeding. In a recent study, an association
between maternal HIV infection and NEC has been
observed in preterm neonates (Desfrere et al. 2005). We
report about a term infant that developed NEC without
identifiable risk factors other than exposure to maternal
HIV infection and to antiretroviral medication.
Methods: Case report.
Results: The 21 year old G1 P1 from Kamerun started
using nevirapine, lamivudine and zidovudine at 31
gestational weeks, viral load decreased from 55.800 to
64 cop/ml prenatally, CD4-cells were normal. Postnatal
adaptation of the newborn was uneventful, birthweight
was 3015g, APGAR scores at 1, 5 and 10 minutes were
6, 10 and 10, respectively. The male infant was
delivered by elective Cesarean section at 37 +4 weeks of
gestation to an HIV positive mother. Postnatal
transmission prophylaxis was performed with
intravenous zidovudine 1.3mg/kg body weight four
times daily. On the fifth day of life, the infant developed
clinical signs of sepsis, interleukin-6 of 50.000ng/nl and
granulocytopenia of 1.3/nl confirmed the diagnosis. An
abdominal x-ray revealed pronounced intestinal
pneumatosis. Besides antibiotic treatment and feeding
abstinence, symptoms deteriorated, and the infant
underwent surgical resection of perforated and necrotic
bowel. Re-anastomosis was performed at four weeks of
age. Vertical HIV-1 infection could be excluded after
three consecutive HIV-DNA polymerase chain reaction
tests at three months.
Conclusions: Exposure to HIV and antiretroviral drugs
is associated with NEC in preterm and term infants.

Background and Aims: Neonatal gastric perforation is
a rare occurrence of often unknown etiology. Our aim is
to explore a case of a term-born neonate with gastric
perforation.
Methods: Fungal and bacterial cultures of blood and
peritoneal fluid. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining of
tissue specimens.
Results: A 37-week boy of 3050 g birth weight was
born vaginally after an uneventful pregnancy. In the 2nd
day of life he became irritable and febrile, and antibiotic
treatment was initiated. Abdominal distention developed
within 4 hours; X-rays showed pneumoperitoneum.
Laparotomy revealed a gastric perforation with
peritonitis. Recurrent perforations were sutured at 9 and
12 days. Candida albicans grew from peritoneal fluid at
2 and from blood at 9 days. PAS staining revealed
fungal spores and filaments in the muscular gastric wall.
Fluconazole was started at 9 days, and liposomal
amphotericin B at 12 days. Granulocyte colony
stimulating factor was administered. At 3 weeks, the
wound and fascia ruptured. Coagulase-negative
Staphylococcus species grew from the peritoneal fluid.
Due to infection the fascia was not reconstructed until at
4 weeks. Wide-spread skin necrosis, severe respiratory
problems and bleeding tendency developed. Fungal
blood cultures remained positive, and fluconazole was
substituted with caspofungin. Granulocyte transfusions
were administered. The infection subsided gradually.
The first negative fungal blood culture was obtained at
23 days, and antifungal treatment discontinued at 53
days. The wound healed well. No increased
susceptibility to infections was noted by one year of age.
Conclusions: Fungal infection and early antifungal
therapy should be considered in term newborns with
gastric perforation.

- 183 -
Background and Aims: Aim of the study was to assess
present nutritional status of children aged 5-6 years and
to identify possible factors influencing growth pattern.
Methods: The cross–sectional study covered randomly
selected 754 children of 5-6 years old. The percentiles
and Z scores of weight for age and for height, height for
age, BMI and the percentile and Z score of BMI were
calculated using EPI INFO program. To identify factors
influencing child growth were used special
questionnaire.
Results: The results revealed prevalence of children
with overweight. The growth depend on the child sex,
the high weight for age is more frequent in girls while
height for age in boys. Approximately 13 per cent of
children’s BMI is under 5 percentile, 18 percent of
children have risk of overweight and 16 percent have
overweight. Genetic factors such as low
anthropometrical indices of parents, poor feeding
practices of the children are suggested reasons for the
low BMI. Length and weight of child at birth showed
significant correlations with height at 5 years.
Socioeconomic factors appeared to be of little
importance as determinants of growth. At the same time
income and per capita food expenditure was positively
correlated with nutritional status.
Conclusions: We can conclude that factors influencing
child growth can be considered as risk factors for
growth and could be used to identify households at risk
of malnutrition, as well as for overweight.

Korinthos, Korinthos, Greece
Background and Aims: Poisoning represents one of the
most common medical emergencies encountered in
childhood. This study was performed to contribute
epidemiological data regarding poisonings in childhood.
Methods: Medical records of 707 children admitted in
our paediatric department for acute poisoning, were
studied. The mean age of the population was 3.2 ± 1.2
years. Results: During the period 1996- 2005, 707
patients, with acute poisoning were admitted in
Paediatric Ward (4.71% of total admissions). The
number of cases increased over the 10-year period. The
seasonal distributions in poisoning patients suggested a
peak on summer (30.3%) and lower numbers on spring
(25.6%), winter (22.3%) and autumn (21.8%). Male
exposures were more prevalent than females
(57.1%vs.42.9%) The etiology most often involved was:
accidental (95.9%), followed by intentional (2.9%) and
undetermined (1.2%). The most commonly implicated
substance categories recorded were: drugs 49.1%
(347/707), especially paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, antihistamines and antibiotics,
cigarette 14.1% (100/707), agricultural drugs 13.2%
(94/707), detergents 12.4% (88/707), alcohol 4%
(28/707), other hazard factors 7.2% (50/707) such as
carbohydrates, carbon monoxide inhalation and plants.
In the majority of cases, complications were mild or
absent and no deaths were recorded.
Conclusions: Accidental poisoning exposures from
drugs, cigarettes and household and agricultural
products remain a significant problem. Severe
symptoms have rarely been observed in drug poisonings
in childhood. The frequency of accidental poisoning in
childhood merits more widespread public education
aimed at preventing exposure to toxic substances.

Background and Aims: The prevalence of smoking
during pregnancy in Ribeirão Preto, one of the richest
cities in the country, was significantly higher (21.4%)
than in São Luís (5.9%), a less developed city. To assess
which variables, especially socioeconomic factors,
explain the higher prevalence of smoking during
pregnancy in the more developed city.
Methods: Two cohort studies were conducted, one in
Ribeirão Preto, in 1994, on a sample of 2846 puerperae,
and the other in São Luís, in 1997/98, on a sample of
2445 puerperae. Logistic regression was used to analyze
the interactions between the factors studied and the city.
Results: In multivariable analysis, the variables
associated with smoking habit in São Luís were a
household with five or more persons (OR 1.72), having
five or more children (OR 2.10), smoking habit of the
companion (OR 2.20) and age of 35 years or more (OR
1.98). Age of less than 20 years was a protective factor
(OR 0.55). In Ribeirão Preto there was association with
low educational level (OR 2.18) and with smoking habit
of the companion (OR 3.25). Receiving prenatal care
was a strong protective factor (OR 0.24). There was a
significant interaction between city and mother working
outside the home, maternal age and prenatal care visits.
However the variables explained little of the difference
in maternal smoking between the two cities.
Conclusions: The variables of the model, especially
income or educational level, provided little explanation
of the higher prevalence of smoking during pregnancy
in the more developed city. Funded by FAPESP and
CNPq.

Background and Aims: Brazil has the highest cesarean
section rate in the world which is higher in a more
developed region, the Southeast, as compared to a less
developed one, the Northeast. To assess which variables
explain the higher cesarean section rate in the more
developed region.
Methods: 2,846 puerperae were evaluated in Ribeirão
Preto (RP), in the Southeast, in 1994, and 2,445 in São
Luís (SL), in the Northeast region. A Poisson regression
model was used to calculate non-adjusted and adjusted
risk estimates. Variables were also adjusted one at a
time in a combined model, including the variable 'city'
in order to identify which variables could explain the
difference in the rate between the two cities.
Results: The cesarean section rate was 50.8% in RP and
33.7% in SL. Practically the same variables were
associated with cesarean delivery in the two towns: age
of 35 years or more (RR 1.45 for RP and 1.54 for SL),
adequate prenatal care (RR 1.24 and 1.29) and delivery
performed by the same doctor who had provided
prenatal care (RR 2.17 and 1.66). Association with
marital status was observed only in São Luís (RR 1.19).
Adjusted analysis in a combined model revealed that the
variables 'category of admission' and 'the same doctor
providing prenatal care and performing delivery'
explained together 90.2% of the difference in cesarean
section rate between the two cities.
Conclusions: Difference in cesarean section rate
between the two cities was explained predominantly by
the physician factor. Funded by FAPESP and CNPq.

Background and Aims: Air pollution affect children in
a particular way, since their respiratory system is still in
development and airways are more vulnerable. The aim
of this work is to investigate atmospheric environment
effects, such as air pollution and meteorological
conditions, on a children population, between 0 and 15
years old, who attend Barreiro city hospital urgencies
with respiratory problems.
Methods: Pollutants and meteorological variables were
measured by stations distributed in the city. To study the
possible relation between environmental factors and
children health, children number admitted in paediatric
urgency service, their symptomatology, meteorological
variables and atmospheric pollutants, descriptive
statistics was made and Pearson correlation coefficients
were calculated.
Results: In the studied period, 958 children were
admitted in city Hospital urgency with respiratory
problems, being 28% for cough, 40% for respiratory
syndrome and 32% for asthma. A negative correlation
between children number and temperature and a positive
correlation with relative humidity was observed.
Concerning the relation between children number and
pollutants concentration, weak but positive correlations
were found for CO and NOx. Remain pollutants were
negatively correlated.
Conclusions: The complexity of intervenient factors
between health and atmospheric environment relation,
are the reason for such weak correlations. Time factors
such as weekdays, annual seasonality, epidemics among
others are called confusion factors and will be
introduced in further studies to achieve better
correlations.

Clinic, Santa Maria Hospital, Lisbon, Portugal
Background and Aims: Cardiovascular disease is an
important cause of morbidity and mortality and can
compromise the graft survival. Aims: Evaluate the
prevalence of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease,
including hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia and
hyperhomocysteinemia and search possible correlation
between themselves.
Methods: Prospective transversal study in patients
between 0 and 19 years old. Hypertension was
considerate when systolic or diastolic blood pressure
was greater then the 95th centile for age, sex and height
and when was introduced antihypertensive therapy.
Obesity with BMI>25; Hypercholesterolemia serum
total cholesterol > 200 mg/dl, Hypertriglyceridemia
serum total triglycerides >200mg/dl, hyperhomo-
cysteinemia serum total homocysteine > 11,3 μmol/l.
Descriptive statistics was made with SPSS-12.0 and
Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated.
Results: In population of 22 patients were identified at
less one risk factor in 19 (86%) and in 17 had 2 or more
risk factors. Hypertension was the alteration more
prevalent 19/22 (86%), after hyperhomocysteinemia in
12 (54,5%) and Hypercholesterolemia in 11/22 (50%).
Obesity and Hypertriglyceridemia were found in 6
(27,2%) and 4 (18,1%) respectively. Positive and
significantly correlation were found for
Hyperhomocysteinemia and Hypercholesterolemia
(r=0,44, p=0,035).
Conclusions: The prevalence of risk factors for
cardiovascular disease is high and is frequent
association between risk factors. In these study positive
correlation were found for Hyperhomocysteinemia and
Hypercholesterolemia. It is necessary improve this
alterations for to assure greater graft survival with best
life quality for patients.

Background and Aims: The obesity in Croatia,
likewise in all over the world, is getting wide
proportions. The early recognition of children with
higher risk of obesity should contribute to the
prevention of different chronic diseases. The relation
between the birth weight (BW) and the total overweight
(TO) (BMI 85 centils) and obesity (BMI 95 centils)
at 7, 11 and 15 years of age were analysed.
Methods: Prospective study of child growth has been
made on children (n=1.721) growing up in the same
social-economical situation in Trogir, Croatia. The BW
prediction on TO or obesity during childhood was
estimated by logistical regression.
Results: The incidence of TO and obesity didn't differ
according the sex (p=0.999) and age (p=0.999). The
examines with BW 4000g showed higher incidence of
TO (14.8% vs 9.62% vs 5%) and obesity (11,72% vs
3.33% vs 3.86%) compared to the children of the same
age whose BW was 2500-3999g and <2500g (p< 0.001
all). For boys aged 11, the increased BW by 100g
increased the obesity risk by 10.6% (p=0.022) and girls
aged 15 by 18.2% (p=0.015). The increased BW by 100
g increased the TO risk by 8.9% for girls aged 11
(p=0.006), for boys aged 15 by 10% (p=0.007) and for
girls aged 15 by 11.1% (p=0.011).
Conclusions: TO and obesity manifestations during
childhood is significantly connected with BW values.
While analysing the obesity factor during childhood, we
recommend that BW should also be taken into
consideration, especially for children with BW 4000g.

Background and Aims: YUSAD study is prospective
five-year study that begun in 1998. Aim of our study
was to monitor levels of LDL, HDL and ApoA lipid
fractions between boys and girls during 5 year period
within YUSAD study group.
Methods: We analyzed separately LDL, HDL, ApoA1
and ApoA2 lipid fractions in two populations of
children (10 years population and 15 years population).
Results were compared with nomograms for age and
gender.
Results: In 3525 children age of 10 years (49.82% girls
and 50.18% boys) and in 3439 children age of 15 years
(49.98% girls and 50.02% boys), LDL, HDL, ApoA1
and ApoA2 lipid fractions were (median value ±
standard deviation): Girls: LDL 2,73±0,81 and
2,48±0,90; HDL 1,42±0,37 and 1,53±0,48; ApoA1
1,54±0,28 and 1,45±0,25; ApoA2 0,38±0,06 and
0,34±0,35. Boys: LDL 2,63±0,74 and 2,28±0,86; HDL
1,45±0,37 and 1,44±0,44; ApoA1 1,60±0,30 and
1,37±0,28; ApoA2 0,39±0,06 and 0,37±0,71.
Conclusions: Higher values of LDL and HDL lipid
fractions but not significant were detected in girls in
both age populations except for HDL levels in 10 year
age group. Higher values of ApoA1 and ApoA2 lipid
fractions but not significant were detected in boys in
both age populations except for ApoA1 levels in 15 year
age group.

Background and Aims: There are no data regarding
prevalence of sleep-wake disturbances in Romanian
population. The aim of this study was to estimate the
prevalence and risk factors of sleep-wake disturbances
among children 3 to 16 years old.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in
Brasov County inwhich there are 400.000 inhabitants.
All the 6 districts were involved, schools from
eachdistrict were randomly selected and we performed
systematic sampling for determination of 17 schools.
We used modified Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ)
– validated and reability scale. Romanian translation
was done and stability of the questionnaire was tested on
a study group of 43 patients before the study. We
evaluated 725 children’s with a mean age of 11, 85±5,03
years.
Results: There were 357 females (49,25%). Habitual
snorers were in 69 cases from which 28 females
(40,57%). Excessive daytime sleepiness evaluated by
Epworth Sleepiness Scale was 8,2 +/- 3,4 overall, 11,23
+/- 5,8 in habitual snorer group and 6,2 +/- 2,4 in
nonsnorer group (p<0,01). Fragmented sleep at least 2
nights per week in 21,09% of cases, sleep talking at
least 2 nights per week in 20,13%, nightmares in 8,82%.
Difficulty falling asleep was founded as a rare problem
in 52,27%, 1-2 times per week in 3,31%, 3-4 times in
6.06% and 5-7 times in 4,82%. Co-sleeping was a rare
problem in 21,51%, 1-2 times per week in 19,71%, 3-4
times in 29,10%, 5-7 times per week in 15,44%.
Conclusions: Sleep-wake disturbances are frequent and
unrecognized pathology.

Background and Aims: Lead poisoning is still very
common in our countries and children are the first
affected because of the ingestion of old paint chips and
dust containing a high percentage of lead. The ingestion
of contaminated tap water or the use of kohl are among
other well-known potential sources. We identified a
relatively unknown source of lead intoxication involving
a young moroccan child and his family: The metal
teapot.
Methods: A thorough discussion with the family lead us
to think to the traditional metallic teapot used by the
whole family as source of the intoxication. Lead
concentration in spout, lid and brewed tea from 8 similar
teapots was tested.
Results: A high blood lead level (BLL) confirmed the
lead intoxication of a Moroccan child. The BLL of 18
other members of his family aged from 1 day to 43 years
were also abnormal. Testing for classical sources of lead
intoxication was negative. The analysis on similar
teapots showed high lead contents with a large variation
of lead concentrations in relation with models.
Conclusions: These kind of metallic teapots as source
of lead intoxication represents a real public health
problem because these kinds of teapots are frequently
used by migrant population and in the catering sector.
Therefore, we want to draw attention to this relatively
unknown potential source of lead, namely the teapots,
particularly in regards to young children and to the
aspects of familial poisoning.
KNOWLEDGE OF TOXICITY OF ELEMENTAL
MERCURY AMONG INNER-CITY POPULATION
P O Ozuah, J E Romm
Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Albert Einstein
College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA
Background and Aims: Published reports suggest that
inner city populations may be exposed to elemental
mercury via ritualistic usage. It is not known if this
population is aware of the risks of mercury exposure.
Objective: To assess awareness of risks associated with
use of elemental mercury among an inner city
population.
Methods: Cross-sectional survey of subjects recruited
from a community in which reports suggest ritualistic
use of elemental mercury may be prevalent. A 23-item
questionnaire was interviewer-administered to all
subjects. We inquired about awareness of potential
toxicity associated with different ritualistic uses of
elemental mercury, knowledge of the routes of
exposure, and methods to limit exposure.
Results: 1000 subjects participated, of whom 43% were
African American and 42% were Hispanic or Latino.
47% of participants did not know that boiling mercury
may result in poisoning, 44% did not know that burning
mercury was harmful, and 40% were unaware that
sprinkling mercury in the house was harmful. Similarly,
81% did not know that children breathe in more vapors
than adults living in the same household, 71% did not
know that mercury should not be flushed down the
toilet, and 47% did not know that mercury vapors were
harmful. 88% of subjects incorrectly thought that most
cases of mercury poisoning were caused by handling
mercury with bare hands.
Conclusions: A substantial number of subjects did not
know that practices associated with ritualistic uses of
mercury might lead to toxicity.

Background and Aims: It is known that adolescents’
behavior is different than that of other pediatric age
groups and they tend to take risks regardless of
consequences. Aim of the study was to determine
factors affecting risky behavior among sexually active
Greek adolescents.
Methods: Of 413 adolescents (159 boys and 216 girls),
which came for various reasons to the outpatient
adolescent clinic over a period of 18 months and
answered a specific questionnaire, 142 reported to be
sexually active (75 boys and 67 girls), mean age 17,5
years. Of them only 63% of the boys and 74% of the
girls reported using any form of protection. Data
analysis was made with SPSS 8.0.
Results: More boys than girls are sexually active under
the age of 18 (P=0.028) and start sexual activity at a
younger age (P=0,005). Boys starting sex at an older age
tend more frequently to use contraception (P=0,015).
Adolescents drinking alcohol were more likely to be
smoking cigarettes (P=0,0001). Adolescents drinking
and/or smoking were more likely to have sexual activity
(P=0,0001 for both). Relations with parents did not
show any correlation with initiation of sexual activity
though there was a correlation (P=0,06) between poor
relationship with parents and amount of consumed
alcohol.
Conclusions: Drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes
were significantly correlated with sexual activity under
the age of 18. It also appears that other factors, outside
the home and the relations with parents are affecting
initiation of sexual activity in Greek adolescents.

Background and Aims: Febrile seizures are common
cause of admission and hospitalisation in a paediatric
clinic in Greece.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study to
examine the epidemiology and clinical features of
hospitalised children with febrile seizures admitted in a
5-year period. A total of 248 children, median age 1.5
(range 0.5-11.5 yrs), were included in our study.
Results: In 50% of the cases, the convulsions occurred
in children under 2yrs and in 82% it was the first
episode. The ratio of boys to girls was 1.8:1. In 4.6% of
cases, there was a family history of febrile seizures. The
average duration of seizures was 2 min (range 0-9 min)
with a predominance of generalised tonic-clonic crisis.
The episode occurred 8h (range 0-96h) from the onset of
fever (39.3±0.69 oC) and in 96% was not recurrent. The
duration of hospitalisation was 3d (range 1-14d). There
was a seasonal variation with a predominance of winter
(33%) and spring (28%) months. Lumbar puncture was
performed in 14% of cases. Upper respiratory tract viral
infection (44%), tonsilitis (18%), otitis media (15%),
gastroenteritis (9%) were the most common causes of
fever. Anticonvulsant therapy was needed in 2.7% of
patients.
Conclusions: Febrile seizures usually occur in
otherwise normal children and are brief, generalised and
relatively benign. First febrile seizures should be
evaluated by a physician to rule out serious underlying
disease. A careful history and thorough physical
examination are essential. Treatment of most febrile
seizures consists of fever control and parental
counseling.
MYOTENOFASCIOTOMY TREATMENT FOR
CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY
I G Nazarov
Medical University of Moscow, Moscow, Russia
Background and Aims: The contractures of muscles
are an important consequence of spasticity that children
with CP suffer. These contractures are retracted fibres of
soft tissues that have no more vitality, like, muscle
fibres, fasciaes, aponeurotic fibres, muscle tendon fibres
and ligaments produced by the degenerative process of
dystrophy and this has a negative influence on all areas
of the locomotor apparatus functions. The aim of this
valuation is to demonstrate the possible optimisation of
CP children with spastic forms of rehabilitation.
Methods: The Miotenofasciotomy eliminates muscle
contractures of upper and lower extremities and those in
the postural muscles of the body. Clinical methods for
medical examination and recordings were made to 107
Spanish patients with CP who were operated using this
surgery treatment. The period of time they were
operated is from March 2005 until April 2006. These
patients had different forms of CP like, spastic forms
and mixed (spastic-hiperkinnetic and spastic-distonic
forms).
Results: In all cases, children obtained positive results
due to the elimination of muscle contractures, for
example, liberation of movements, elimination of
several forms of deformities in upper and lower
extremities, improvement of balance and postures, and
in some of the cases, they have been able to start
walking with walkers, crutches or by themselves.
Conclusions: The Miotenofasciotomy, together with
other therapies, optimise the rehabilitation of children
with spastic forms of CP.

Background and Aims: The authors intend to present
the pulmonary complications of various forms of
muscular atrophies. These complications have been
severe in type I and II of the disease and only transitory
in type III. These complications have consisted of
bacterial pulmonary infections that finally ended in
death in the two cases with type I and II disease.
Methods: There are presented 3 cases of spinal
muscular atrophy with 3 types of disease. A 1 month old
infant with generalized hypotonia having the appearance
of a doll. The final diagnosis is Werdnig-Hoffmann
disease type 1. The second case, a 7 month old infant is
brought for a severe generalized hypotonia beginning at
the age of 6-7 months. Established the diagnosis: Spinal
muscular atrophy type 2. The third case is seen for a
severe scoliosis and in the end the diagnosis was type 3
spinal muscular atrophy.
Results: In the first case the diagnosis was established
by molecular genetics which showed mutations of the
gene coding SMN on chromosome 5. The evolution was
lethal in the second case the diagnosis was established
by muscular biopsy, which showed denervated skeletal
muscles with atrophy had congenital hypothyroidism
and rickets as associated pathology. The evolution was
finally lethal. In the third case the infections have been
controlled and the child maintained the motor
acquisitions.
Conclusions: The evolution of cases with spinal
muscular atrophy is usually severe, with an elevated
mortality rate.

Crete, Greece
Background and Aims: Idiopathic intracranial
hypertension (I.I.H.) is uncommon in children. It is
critical to recognize the warning signs and symptoms to
prevent devastating ophthalmologic complications.
Obesity has been reported as an important risk factor for
I.I.H.
Methods: We report two cases of obese adolescent
patients who were diagnosed with I.I.H. Case 1: A 13-
year-old obese male, with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of
32,8 presented with diplopia and neck pain during the
last 15 days. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was
- 188 -
870mmH20, with normal CSF content. Case 2: A 13-
year-old obese female, with a BMI of 28 presented with
headache, nausea and occasional vomiting during the
last 10 days and diplopia the last 2 days. She referred
use of minocyclin as treatment for acnes. CSF pressure
was 420mm H20, with normal CSF content and blood
pressure. In both cases neurologic examination revealed
VI cranial nerve palsy, ophthalmologic examination
revealed papilledema, blood chemistry was normal and
brain MRI was unremarkable. Both patients started
treatment with acetazolamide and were put on a low
calorie diet. During the following 3 months papilledema
gradually resolved and treatment was tapered while they
remained symptom free.
Results: In both cases patients were obese (>95th
percentile), although the use of minocyclin of the second
patient may have contribute in the development of IIH.
Conclusions: Obesity may constitute a more relevant
risk factor for IIH in the pediatric and adolescent
population in the next years, as its prevalence increases
among that population.
EVALUATION OF THE SPECIFIC
DYSMORPHIC FEATURES IN
MULTIMALFORMATIVE SYNDROMES

M Krstevska-Konstantinova
Department of Endocrinology and Genetics, Pediatric
Clinic, Skopje, Macedonia
Background and Aims: The combination of minor and
major dysmorphic malformations is unique in various
multimalformative syndromes. Some of them are well-
known and easy to recognize, but in the majority of the
cases evaluation of spectrum of present anomalies is
time-consuming and difficult. Some of the minor
dysmorphic stigmata (hypertelorism, epicantus,
clinodactylia) are more frequent and present in many
syndromes, thus are not informative. Appearance of
specific pattern of dysmorphic features (lobulated
tongue, creases of the ear lobules, iris spots) can help in
syndrome delineation.
Methods: Evaluation of 250 children with various
congenital malformations was done. The children were
divided in 4 groups and subgroups according to the
etiology. Malformations and combination of
malformations (both minor and major) of head, neck,
extremities and organs were analyzed.
Results: The mean number of minor anomalies in the
group of children with chromosomal disorders was 38
and 24 per child in the group of nonchromosomal
syndromes. The most frequent minor anomalies were
eye slanting and space (21%), ear position and modeling
(16%) and hair pattern (14%), finger length and
abnormal dermatoglyphes (28%). The significant
association in several combinations between minor and
major anomalies was noticed, such as hypertelorism and
heart defect; posteriorly rotated ears with kidney
anomalies, etc. In some syndromes specific minor
malformations were found and discussed.
Conclusions: In the era of powerful, but expensive
genetic testing, it is important to set the investigation in
proper direction. Recognizing the pattern of minor and
major malformations in children with multimalformative
syndromes is essential step in delineating the specific
syndrome.

Servicio de Pediatria, Hospital de León, León, Spain
Background and Aims: Venipuncture is the painful
procedure more used in pediatrics and in that way it's
seen for allied health personnel and for parents. This
study measures the pain caused by venipuncture in
children under three years old, judging the differences
which can be attributed to sex.
Methods: Prospective, cross-sectional and observational
study in 30 infants, with a mean age of 16,3 months,
which venipuncture was carried out to performing a
renal scan. Bell pain rating scale was applied in all of
them, which takes into account behavioral parameters -
facial expression, motor activity, body language, cry and
solace and biological ones - heart rate (HR), blood
pressure (BP) and O2 saturation (SAT); and pain is
classified in: Absence of pain, moderate pain and
intense pain. Results were compared using the Mann-
Whitney U, Wilcoxon and 2 test, as appropriate.
Results: Venipuncture didn't cause measurable pain in
26,6% of children; it caused moderate pain in 56,6% and
intense pain in 16,6%. There was no difference between
sexes in the intensity of pain detected by total score on
the scale (p= 0, 54) or by distribution in pain ranges
(p= 0, 89). Venipuncture caused a significant increase in
HR (p= 0, 025) and in BP (p< 0, 0001). There weren't
significant changes in SAT and behavior sings in any of
the children.
Conclusions: Venipuncture cause moderate or intense
pain around of 75% of our patients. In our group of
children (under 3 years old) we haven't detected
measurable differences in pain caused by venipuncture
which depends on sex.

Background and Aims: The presence of two genetic
disorders in a single patient is uncommon. We describe
a case of a child with Finnish type congenital nephrotic
syndrome diagnosed in the neonatal period and a urea
cycle disorder diagnosed later.
Results: Newborn admitted at Neonatal Unity at D2
because of respiratory distress. Euthocic delivery at 35th
week of gestational age. Large placenta. Diagnostic of
nephrotic syndrome at 8th of life. Infectious causes of
congenital nephrotic syndrome were excluded. He
started therapy with albumin, furosemid, aspirin,
- 189 -
captopril, levotiroxine, calcium carbonate, D vitamin,
imunoglobulin infusions and erythropoietin. At 2 month
the renal biopsy confirmed Finnish type nephrotic
syndrome and began indometacin. Because of arterial
hypertension, he was medicated with losartan and
nifedipine. At 3 month, he presented with respiratory
distress, seizures, multiorgan failure and coma. Of the
laboratorial analysis we emphasize severe metabolic
acidosis and ammonia >1000 ug/dl. The child started
peritoneal dialysis and was medicated with arginine,
carnitine, phenylbutyrate and benzoate. Metabolic defect
workup: increased urine and plasma argininosuccinic
acid levels, increased plasma citrulline levels and
diminished plasma arginine levels. Diagnose confirmed
with Argininosuccinic acid lyase assay. Cerebral
magnetic resonance showed '…global atrophy…'. He
had several catheter sepsis. At 12 month he died of a
Steven Johnson Syndrome.
Conclusions: Finnish type nephrotic syndrome and
Argininosuccinate lyase deficiency are rare autosomal
recessive diseases. In the first, an intensive medical
treatment followed by renal transplantation, leads to a
remarkable reduction of mortality. In the second, early
diagnosis of hyperammonaemia is necessary to improve
survival.
URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS (UTI) IN
CHILDREN. HOW NECESSARY IS IT TO
OBTAIN A URINE CULTURE UNDER
TREATMENT?

Piraeus, Greece
Background and Aims: Obtaining a urine culture
sample on the 3rd day of treatment in a child with a
urinary tract infection (UTI) in order to assess response
to therapy has become standard practice in pediatric
departments. The aim of our study was to examine
whether that practice is necessary to perform in a child
who otherwise has signs of clinical improvement and is
receiving the appropriate antibiotic therapy (according
to the sensitivity of the isolated pathogen).
Methods: We examined the records of children with
UTIs admitted to our department during a five year
period (2000-2005). Urinary cultures were taken in 310
children (138 boys-172 girls, 15 days-14 yrs old) with
established UTIs on the 3rd day of a treatment
compatible with sensitivity of the offending pathogen to
the appropriate antibiotic. 16.1% of cultures were taken
as freshly voided urine, 0.6% with a suprapubic
puncture, 12.9% with the use of a catheter and 70.3%
using a bag.
Results: 307/310 (99%) came up with either sterile or
negative cultures on the 3rd day. Only 3 (1%) continued
to have positive cultures. Further evaluation revealed the
presence of a renal abscess in 1, bilateral double pelvis
and ureters with ureterocystic junction stenosis in the
other and the last had developed resistance to the initial
amoxicillin regimen.
Conclusions: Urinary cultures taken under treatment are
totally unnecessary in children who otherwise show
improved clinical status and should only be reserved for
cases with none or partial improvement as well as those
with major congenital renal abnormalities.

Children’s Hospital “P&A. Kyriakou”, Athens, Greece
Background and Aims: Isolated significant hematuria
in children can be a sign of numerous causes, benign or
not. At those children an evaluation of renal function
can be made with the use of urine beta2-microglobulin
(b2-MG) and alpha1-microglobulin (a1-MG) which are
indices of renal tubular damage and urine microalbumin
(L) which is an index of renal glomerular damage. Our
aim was to measure b2-MG, a1-MG and L in children
with hematuria in a routine urinalysis without obvious
proteinuria.
Methods: First morning void urine samples were
collected from 678 healthy children (403 boys and 275
girls) 7-12 years old and from 72 children (37 boys and
35 girls, mean age 9,9 ± 1,8yrs) with hematuria without
proteinuria in urinalysis. Beta2-microglobulin, alpha1-
microglobulin and microalbumin levels were measured
with the nephelometry method and expressed as mg/L.
Results: There was a statistically significant elevation
of microalbumin and alpha1-microglobulin in children
with hematuria (median values of 51,8 and 7,74
respectively) in relation with healthy children (median
values 13,2 and 5,58 respectively). No significant
correlation was found for beta2-microglobulin between
the two groups.
Conclusions: Children with hematuria in urinalysis
have elevated values of microalbumin and alpha1-
microglobulin, indicating mild renal damage.

Background and Aims: Ectopic kidney is poorly
visualized with ultrasound. Other imaging methods are
mandatory when the patients present with
microhematuria and non-specific low abdominal pains.
The aim of this work was to present a boy who
developed hydronephrosis in ectopic kidney.
- 190 -
Methods: Standard clinical laboratory and radiographic
methods including ultrasonography, radionuclide
studies, IVP and CT scanning.
Results: A ten year old boy presented with non-
glomerular hematuria. Ultrasound scan, radionclide
studies and IVP revealed a well functioning ectopic left
kidney (pelvic ectopia). Four years after diagnosis of
ectopia the boy complained to lower abdominal pains
and urinalyses showed non-glomerula microscopic
hematuria. The US poorly visualized the left kidney, on
plain X-ray there was a calculus, which was located in
the pyelon of the left kidney causing obstruction and
hydronephrosis (IVP, CT scan, diuretic scintigraphy).
The boy underwent surgery for extraction of the
calculus. Conclusions: Children with ectopic kidneys
and non-glomerular hematuria should undergo
additional imaging studies. Ultrasound scanning does
not allow good visualization of calculi and
hydronephrosis in ectopic kidneys.

Background and Aims: There is evidence that
congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract
(CAKUT) have genetic basis. The aim of this study is to
present a family in which the father and his child, who
was born after in vitro fertilization (IVF), were found to
have CAKUT. Methods: Ultrasound, radionuclide and
X ray studies were performed to define the type of
CAKUT. Results: The index case was born after IVF.
He was the very one of three babies who survived. He
was treated in the ICU for the immaturity and
respiratory distress. As a consequence of neonatal brain
damage, he developed cerebral paralysis. On imaging,
he was found to have unilateral hydronephrosis on the
right side. An ureterocella was demonstrated with
ultrasound, IVP and VCUG and the boy underwent
surgery. The postoperative course was uneventful and
his renal function was normal. The both parents were
screened for CAKUT. The father was found to have
small hypoplastic right kidney. Conclusions: IVF is
incriminated for higher incidence of congenital
anomalies in babies born after this procedure. In our
case we can speculate about genetic basis of the
CAKUT in the parent and his child; it is known that
CAKUT may be associated with anomalies of funiculus
spermaticus, which is responsible for father's infertility.

Background and Aims: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is
a common urinary tract malformation. Occasionally
urolithiasis may be found in children with VUR. The
aim of this work was to present an association (by
chance) of two urologic conditions in a child.
Methods: Standard clinical, biochemical, and imaging
studies for evaluation of the kidneys and urinary tract.
Results: One year old male infant presented with
symptomatic urinary tract infection. Cystographic study
revealed left sided vesicoureteral refllux grade III. The
child was given regular hemoprophylaxis. After three
years of conservative treatment, the reflux resolved.
Laboratory studies revealed persistent microscopic
hematuria of non-glomerular origine. The ultrasound
scanning did not find any abnormality. Six months later
moderate left sided hydronephrosis was noted. This
prompted X-ray study which demonstrated big calculus
in the lower portion of the left ureter. Metabolic studies
established cystinuria. The calculus was surgically
removed. On surgery prevesical stesnosis of the left
ureter was seen. The child was given alkali therapy and
new calculi were not seen during the follow up.
Conclusions: Persistent non-glomerular hematuria
should prompt investigation of the urinary tract.
Although ultrasound is a non invasive method, it is
insufficient to demonstrate ureteral stones, for this
purpose X-ray studies are still needed.

Background and Aims: Hematuria represents a serious
differential diagnostic problem to the pediatrician. The
aim of this study was to describe a pediatric patient with
recurrent attacks of gross hematuria, who was found to
suffer from nutcracker-phenomenon.
Methods: The source of hematuria was evaluated by the
use of SDS-PAG electrophoresis of urinary proteins
using frozen urine sample. Doppler ultrasound was
performed to diagnose nutcracker phenomenon.
Results: A 10 year old boy had recurrent short lasting
episodes of painless gross hematuria. In one attack urine
sample was obtained and frozen until analysis. SDS-
PAG electrophoresis showed non-glomerular type of
hematuria on the basis of presence of clear fractions of
apolipoprotein A-1, IgG and alfa-2-macroglobulin. This
indicated searching for non-glomerular causes of the
bleeding. Ultrasound and Doppler study demonstrated
nutcracker phenomenon (left renal vein entrapment
between aorta and superior mesenteric artery).
Conclusions: Pediatricians should think about
nutcracker phenomenon as a cause of non-glomerular
bleeding. SDS-PAG electrophoresis is a useful tool for
- 191 -
differentiation glomerular from nonglomerular
hematurias, particularly when fresh-voided urine
samples are not available.

Department of Metabolism, University Hospital-
Pediatric Clinic, Skopje, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Pompe disease also known as
Glycogen storage disease type II (GSD-II), is a rare
autosomal recessive lisosomal disorder caused by
inherited deficiency of acid alpha - glucosidase. The
most severe is the classic infantile-onset form with
prominent cardiomegaly, hipotonia, and death priop to
first year of life. We report an infant with the classical
course of the infantile-onset Pompe disease, who died at
4,5 months of age due to pneumonia and hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.
Methods: The diagnosis was based on physical
examination, cardiology investigation, serum CPK
assay, and autopsy study.
Results: The patient was admitted to the hospital at 3,5
months of age due to generalized muscle weakness,
feeding and respiratory difficulties. Rapidly increased
hypotonia, respiratory distress, progressive
macroglossia, and cardiomegaly characterized
progression of the disease. Left ventricular thickening
increased over time. EKG showed a shortened PR
interval and large QRS complexes. Despite the profound
hypotonia muscles had firm and hypertrophic
appearance.
Conclusions: Death occurred within one month of
hospitalization due to cardiorespiratory failure. On
autopsy glycogen had accumulated in the liver,
myocardium, and skeletal muscle.

considered an important risk factor for the development
of renal insufficiency. Some anatomical abnormalities of
the urinary system predispose to infection, and their
correction is sometimes necessary to solve the problem.
The authors report a clinical case of a rare urological
malformation in a girl with multiple urinary infections.
Methods: Revision of the clinical case by medical and
image registrations.
Results: Girl, 10 years old, was admitted at the age of 8
for investigation of frequent urinary infections and
urological malformation presented on image evaluation.
Their parents were addicted to drugs, and the pregnancy
was not under surveillance. Delivery took place in the
hospital at term. Good height and weight evolution and
no pathological important events until the age of 6 years
old, when she had the first urinary infection. Subsequent
evaluation revealed a triplicated collecting system with
upper pole ureterohydronephrosis, and a left upper pole
nephrectomy was realized. The patient did not have any
other urogenital anomaly.
Conclusions: Despite ureteral duplication is a frequent
urological anomaly, the presence of three ureters
occurring in the same side, in a complete or incomplete
form, is a true rarity. Since the first description of
ureteral triplication by Wrany in 1870, about 100 cases
have been reported and paediatric cases are fewer. The
authors report this case in spite of it rarity and the
difficulty of the diagnosis. A thorough evaluation of
such an anomaly is essential for effective management.
A COMPREHENSIVE CONSERVATIVE
MANAGEMENT FOR END-STAGE RENAL
FAILURE
A J Al Mosawi
Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital in Al
Kadhimiyia, Baghdad, Iraq
Background and Aims: The appropriate dietary and
pharmacologic management (conservative measures) of
patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) includes:
protein and phosphorus restriction, calorie and water
soluble vitamins supplementation, phosphate binders,
etc. With appropriate dietary and pharmacologic
management, patients with non-terminal chronic renal
failure (CRF) can be maintained surprisingly well, and
the transition from non-terminal CRF to end-stage-renal
failure ESRF represents a small decrement of renal
function resulting in a large physiologic hurdle for the
patient. Conservative measures can only be successful in
non- terminal CRF, and patients with ESRF can't sustain
life in the absence of renal replacement therapy. The
addition to these effective traditional measures, an agent
enhance fecal nitrogen excretion can possibly bridge this
gap resulting from this small decrement of renal
function obviating the need for RRT for some period of
time. A novel regimen combining the traditional
conservative management of CRF with addition of
Acacia gum (AG) 1g/kg /day has been reported to
provide patients with ESRF dialysis freedom. Aim: To
describe the longest period of dialysis freedom (3-year)
achieved in history with this novel form of RRT.
Methods: An 11-year-old girl with ESRF who initially
required 4 sessions of intermittent peritoneal dialysis to
control uremic symptoms despite conservative
measures. Thereafter, managed with a novel regimen
combining the traditional conservative management of
CRF including low protein diet with addition of Acacia
gum (AG) 1g/kg /day. One year dialysis and improve
well- being was achieved [Published in October issue of
Pediatric Nephrology 2004]. This patient continued the
previously described regimen for additional two years.
Results: During these 2 years she continue in
experiencing improved well- being and good
participation in outdoor activities, had never been
acidotic or experienced any uremic symptoms. A
maximum urea level of 127mg /dl and a serum
- 192 -
creatinine of 5 mg/dl were noted during a period of
decreases adherence to dietary restriction and less
compliance to AG therapy. Periods of decreased
compliance with other pharmacologic therapies such as
iron and erythropoietin, calcium carbonate, and one-
alphacalcidol. Was associated with hypochromic
microcytic anemia and renal osteoystrophy. These
problems of anemia and renal ostedystrophy were
solved by returning to the strict adherence to all of the
items of the regimen.
Conclusions: This is the first paper describing three
years dialysis freedom in a child with ESRF.
EARLY ONSET END-STAGE RENAL FAILURE
IN OCULO-CEREBRO-RENAL PHENOTYPE:
NOVEL OCCURRENCE
A J Al Mosawi
Head of the Department of Pediatrics, University
Hospital, Al Kadhimiyia, Baghdad, Iraq
Background and Aims: The Oculo-cerebro-renal
syndrome (OCRS) is a rare disorder characterized by
congenital ocular and cerebral defects, and renal tubular
dysfunction with later renal onset of renal failure during
the fourth. The paper reports the novel occurrence of
early end-stage renal failure (ESRF) in OCRS
phenotype.
Methods: From 1994 to 2005 four patients (two boys
and two girls) with OCRS phenotype were observed. All
of them have congenital cataract(s), hypotonia and
hyporeflexia and renal dysfunction.
Results: The ocular abnormalities in three patients were
similar to those reported in the classical OCRS of Lowe
consisting of cataract(s) and glaucoma. One patient
(boy) has immature cataracts, and bilateral congenital
chorioretinal hypoplasia. The 2 boys have nystagmus
during infancy, in one of them nystagmus was not
present at the time of referral. All the patients have
hypotonia and hyporeflexia characteristic of Lowe
OCRS. In one patient (girl) hypotonia and hyporeflexia
occurred late and was not present during the first 3 years
of life. Three patients have global developmental delay.
One patient has normal IQ and her language was well
developed. All the patients reached ESRF during the
first 6 years of life and required dialysis. All of them
have microscopic hematuria, albuminuria, and casturia
suggesting glomerular disorder. None of them have
evidence of renal tubular dysfunction. Three patients
died from uremia during the first decade of life. It was
not possible to follow the fourth patient.
Conclusions: This is the first paper reporting early
onset of ESRF during the first decade of life.
UNILATERAL RENAL AGENESIS ASSOCIATED
WITH 76TH CASE OF COFFIN-SIRIS
SYNDROME IN THE WORLD
A J Al Mosawi
Head of Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital
Al Kadhimiyia, Baghdad, Iraq
Background and Aims: Coffin Siris syndrome (CSS) is
a rare clinical syndrome of unknown etiology, first
described by Coffin GS and Siris E in 3 unrelated girls
with mental retardation and absent nails and terminal
phalanx of the fifth finger in 1970. Until now only 75
cases have been reported. Renal agenesis has been
reported infrequently in CSS.
Methods: Patient: A 4 years old dysmorphic and
mentally retarded girl. She was born at 30 weeks of
gestation by cesarean delivery because of lack of
progress of labour. Her weight was 1.75 kg. During
infancy feeding difficulties was prominent. Her
development was retarded with no language
development, gross motor milestones was slightly better
than other fields of development. She didn't have any
urinary complaint. Her growth was retarded with all of
her parameters below the third centiles. She has coarse
facial features with thick eyebrows, mild left ptosis big
mouth, thick prominent lips facial hypertrichosis and
low nuchal hair line. Her hands showed single palmer
creases, fingers and nails were small; the terminal
phalanges of her fingers were small with hypoplastic
changes more severe on the little finger of the right
hand.
Results: Radiological examination showed hypoplastic
distal phalanges with rudimentary terminal phalanx of
the right fifth digit. Abdominal sonography revealed
absence the right kidney with no other abnormality.
Brain CT scan and chromosomal analysis showed
normal findings has been reported from USA, Europe,
Turkey, Japan, and India.
Conclusions: 76th patient with CSS, and the first Arab
with CSS, associated unilateral renal agenesis, an
infrequently reported association.
ASSESSMENT OF FEVER, WBC, ESR AND CRP
IN THE FIRST URINARY TRACT INFECTION IN
CHILDREN
A Nickavar
Department of Pediatrics, Hazrat Rassoul Hospital,
Tehran, Iran
Background and Aims: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is
one of the most common infections in children, which in
the form of acute pyelonephritis with delayed and
improper treatment leads to kidney scarring,
hypertention and renal failure. The present study was
done for the evaluation of important differentiating
parameters in pyelonephritis and cystitis.
Methods: This cross sectional study was performed in
96 patients with the first attack of UTI during 3 years.
Acute pyelonephritis diagnosed by DMSA scan in 71
cases. Parameters such as fever, ESR, CRP, and WBC
were analysed in these two disease.
Results: Most of the patients were female. 75% of cases
had less than 5 years and the most prevalent symptoms
were fever, dysuria, urinary frequency, incontinence,
and flank pain. The most common isolated germ was E
coli. Bilateral renal involvement was reported in 48
patients in DMSA scan. CRP (qualitative) was positive
in 40 cases of pyelonephritis (14% 1+, 7% 2+, 35% 3+,
35% negative and undetermined in 9%) and 6 with
cystitis (8% 2+, 16% 3+,64% negative and 12%
- 193 -
undetected). Fever, ESR and WBC were not important
statistical parameters in differentiating pyelonephritis
and cystitis.
Conclusions: CRP is the most valuable laboratory
parameter which could be used reliably for the
assessment of pyelonephritis.

Background and Aims: Investigation of urinary tract
infection (UTI) in first simple febrile convulsion is
controversy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
incidence of urinary tract infection in children with
simple febrile convulsion
Methods: All children with diagnosis of first simple
febrile convulsion that admitted to hospital of Imam,
Oromieh, Iran between January 2003 and December
2004 were included in the study. A first simple febrile
convulsion and UTI work-up including lumbar puncture,
complete blood count, CRP, ESR, blood glucose, serum
calcium, serum electrolytes, renal function tests,
urinalysis, urine culture, blood culture were performed
in all patients. Chest X-ray, EEG and CT scan were
requested in suspected cases. Patients with UTI, defined
as more than 100,000 colony-forming units per milliliter
of a single pathogen obtained by midstream urine
collection, were evaluated for renal imaging.
Results: Two hundred fifty one consecutive cases aged
6-60 months were evaluated. The simple febrile
convulsion work-up of patients other than UTI did not
demonstrate any significant underlying disorder. Renal
function tests were within normal levels in all patients.
Four urinary tract infections with grade 4 reflux were
diagnosed
Conclusions: It is of importance that UTI was presented
initially with simple febrile convulsion. It is well known
that UTI is a common cause of high fever. Urine culture
should be considered in work-up of the children with
first simple febrile convulsion.

Background and Aims: The prevention and notice of
using ring procedure in circumcision especially in early
infancy.
Methods: Case study: The patients that circumcision is
done with ring they have had fullness in kidney before
of ring dropping.
Results: 1. We have to use ring with caution because it
may be give hydronephrosis or urination problem
especially before dropping of ring. 2. The infant with
ring shouldn't be closed with diaper. 3. The ring method
can be used only with serious observation.
Conclusions: The neonate and infants have narrow duct
for urination and they closed with diaper and when they
undergo to ring procedure they urination and kidney
problem is increased. So it is better we don't do the ring
procedure in early infant or it have to do with caution.

Background and Aims: The aggressive and severe
supervision have to do in patients with ring circumcision
because it may induce obstruction in urinogenitary duct.
Applying of ring method in circumcision should be done
with precaution.
Methods: We studied this article with case study. In my
patients that undergone ring circumcision, when we
used from catheter they have not any problem but after
removing catheter they have had fullness in U.G system.
Results: 1. The ring method is not very good procedure
in circumcision especially in early infancy because it
may be induced or increased urethral obstruction.
Conclusions: In my study, all patients when we use
catheter in urinary system, the patient have no problem
but when we removed it the patient have fullness in U.G
system in scan and sonography. We noticed when we
use catheter the patients had no problem in sono and
scan but after removing catheter they found problem in
scan and sonography.

Children’s Hospital “P&A. Kyriakou”, Athens, Greece
Background and Aims: It is well established that, for
both children and adults, elevated values of urine beta2-
microglobulin (b2-MG) and alpha1-microglobulin (a1-
MG) are indices of renal tubular damage and elevated
urine microalbumin (L) is an index of renal glomerular
damage. Measurement of these indices at first morning
void urine samples is corresponding quite accurately
with the 24 hour urine sample and is much more
convenient to obtain in children. Our aim was to
evaluate the normal range of L, b2-MG and a1-MG in
healthy children using first morning void urine samples.
Methods: First morning void urine samples were
collected from 678 healthy children (384 boys and 294
girls) 7-12 years old. Children with a history of urinary
tract infections or other renal disease, with febrile
disease the last 15 days, abnormal findings in urinalysis
or drug treatment of any kind were excluded from our
study. Beta2-microglobulin, alpha1-microglobulin and
- 194 -
microalbumin were measured with the nephelometry
method.
Results: See table.
Conclusions: Knowledge of normal value range of
urine beta2-microglobulin, alpha1-microglobulin and
microalbumin in healthy children is essential in order to
evaluate renal tubular and glomerular function.

Background and Aims: Congenital urinary tract
anomalies are often in children. We present a case of
late detected urinary tract malformation. We
investigated a 12 years boy with fever and urinary tract
infection. The ultrasound examination showed
ureterohydronephrosis on the left side and one 4x3 cm
cystic formation. Acute pyelonephritis was severe with
abdominal and lumbal pain, high temperature and
laboratory findings for developing urosepsis.
Methods: CT abdomen showed hydronephrotic left
kidney with reduction of the parenchyma and
pyonephros. Radionuclide renal scanning (DMSA) was
pathological with a functional left kidney. Conventional
radio-opaque voiding cystourethrography (VCUG)
confirmed the diagnosis of stenosis prevesicalis with
ureterohydronephrosis of the left side.
Results: The patient was undergoing on surgical
treatment with percutaneus nephroureterostomia. The
performed pyelography from the nephroureterostomia
showed the results of dilated ureter (24 mm) with
stenosis prevesicalis on the left side. The surgeon had
drained 10 liters liquid out of the kidney.
Conclusions: We had stabilised the clinical symptoms.
After one month drainage of the kidney we did not have
better function of the kidney and we had done the
unilateral nephrectomia. The patient has been stabilized
without any further urinary tract infection. Urinary tract
malformations should be recognised early after birth not
as a late complication.

Background and Aims: VEGF is a potent endothelial
cell growth factor expressed in normal lung tissue. This
study was performed to investigate the expression of
VEGF in development rat lung under basal conditions
and after hypoxia and oxidative stress.
Methods: We evaluated pulmonary VEGF expression
in rats at 0 and 14 days of life. At 4-8 hours of life
newborn rats were exposed in sequential way during 2
hours in hypoxia, and recovered in >95% oxygen or
21% oxygen; the control group were exposed in 21%
oxygen. For VEGF inmunostaining, the lungs were
fixed by intratracheal instillation 4% paraformaldehyde
and paraffin embedded for tissue sections.
Inmunohistochemistry was performed on lung tissue
sections by using 1:100 dilution of rabbit anti-human
VEGF. We used a semiquantitative assessment of
VEGF inmunostained, were assigned a relative value
from 0 (minimal) to 4 (most intense).
Results: The 14 days groups had decreased VEGF
inmunostaining compared with 0 days group in the same
situation. The group exposed to hypoxia had increased
VEGF inmunostaining. The group recovered in >95%
oxygen had decreased VEGF inmunostaining compared
with the group recovered in 21% oxygen in the alveolar
epithelium, cells of the interstice and cells of the
bronchi; this find was strong in 14 days samples.
Conclusions: The VEGF is expressed during postnatal
rat lung development. The hypoxia may increase VEGF
expression. These date suggest that acute oxidant injury
in newborn rat lung resulted in decreased epithelial
VEGF expression.

Background and Aims: Preterm birth might
permanently affect vascular structure and growth. We
have previously found reduced diameter in the distal
part of the aorta of adolescents born preterm. In the
present study, we hypothesized that subjects born
preterm have smaller aortas throughout the vessel course
and investigated this hypothesis using MRI.
Methods: 88 healthy adolescents (mean age 15 y) were
included in the study; 46 born preterm weighing less
than 1500g at birth and 42 controls born at term. Each
participant underwent a single scanning session on a 1.5
- 195 -
T MR scanner. The protocol included a pulse-gated
Fiesta sequence with 25 images within the heart cycle.
Six 5mm thick slices were positioned 4.5cm apart, along
the descending aorta. The first slice was positioned just
below the iliac bifurcation. The aortas were segmented
using a subpixel-precision Active Contour Model
implemented in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick,
Massachusetts, USA), permitting automatic calculations
of end-diastolic aortic cross sectional areas. Blood
pressure and heart rate were also recorded.
Results: Subjects born preterm had 15.4-19.8%
narrower aortic lumen on all levels, as compared to
controls (p < 0.001). This difference remained highly
significant when correcting for body surface.
Adolescents born preterm also had higher systolic and
diastolic blood pressure. In multivariate analysis, BP
correlated to height and preterm birth, but not to aortic
luminal area or gender.
Conclusions: Preterm birth is associated with general
aortic narrowing and higher BP in adolescence. The
long-term cardiovascular consequences of these findings
remain to be studied.
LOW FOLATE IN PREGNANCY - A
PREVENTABLE PERINATAL RISK FACTOR
FOR CORONARY HEART DISEASE?
H Martin, B Lindblad, M Norman
Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden
Background and Aims: Low folate levels during
pregnancy correlate with low birth weight (LBW), a
perinatal risk factor for later coronary disease. Our aim
was to study the relations between levels of folate,
vitamin B12 and homocysteine (Hcy) and vascular
endothelial dysfunction – a key factor in early
pathophysiology of coronary heart disease – in newborn
infants with low or normal birth weight, and their
mothers.
Methods: We used a laser-Doppler technique to
measure skin perfusion before and after transdermal
iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh; an endothelium-
dependent vasodilator). Red blood cell (RBC) folate,
vitamin B12 and Hcy levels were measured in all
subjects.
Results: The perfusion response to ACh was lower
(p<0.001) in LBW infants (n=30, mean birth weight
2394 g) than in normal birth weight controls (n=52,
mean birth weight 3571 g). The neonatal ACh response
correlated with the RBC folate levels, both in infants
(r=0.43, p=0.003) and their mothers (r=0.36, p=0.004).
We found no significant difference between the folate
levels of LBW and control infants (p=0.11) but the
mothers of LBW infants had lower RBC folate levels
than mothers of control infants (p=0.02). The levels of
vitamin B12 and Hcy were similar in the two groups and
no correlations were found between the levels of
vitamin B12 or Hcy and endothelial function.
Conclusions: The data presented here provide the first
evidence for a relation between low folate levels in
pregnancy and vascular endothelial dysfunction in the
developing human fetus. Low folate levels late in
pregnancy may be a preventable perinatal risk factor for
coronary heart disease.
EFFECTS OF ORAL AND VAGINAL
INDOMETHACIN ON PULMONARY NITRIC

Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA, 2

Gynecology, Miller Children's Hospital, Long Beach,
CA, USA
Background and Aims: Antenatal indomethacin is
associated with PPHN. Nitric oxide (NO) is a
pulmonary vasodilator and its inhibition results in
elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. Endothelin-1
(ET-1) is a vasoconstrictor that mediates pulmonary
hypertension. Using a rabbit model for preterm birth, we
compared the effects of oral and vaginal indomethacin
on NO, cGMP, ET-1, and big ET-1 in fetal rabbit lungs.
Methods: Pregnant rabbits (n=6/group) were induced
with RU486, prior to administration of oral
indomethacin (OI, 20 mg); oral vehicle (OV); vaginal
indomethacin (VI, 20 mg in cocoa butter); or vaginal
cocoa butter (placebo, VP) once daily for 2 days. At
delivery, fetal lung NO metabolites (NOx), cGMP, ET-
1, and big ET-1 were measured.
Results: OI increased fetal lung NOx levels (60.6±1.5
mol/mg protein, p<0.01) compared to OV (41.2±4.1),
VI (42.7±1.4), and VP (31.7±1.8). OI caused a similar
increase in ET-1 levels (9.6±1.3 pg/mg protein, p<0.01)
compared to OV (3.83±1.22), VI (1.5±0.5), and VP
(3.58±1.1). cGMP levels (pmol/mg protein) were higher
with VI (23.9±1.9, p<0.05) than OI (16.6±1.3)
treatment. VI treatment also resulted in higher big ET-1
levels (0.24±0.05 pg/mg protein, p<0.01) compared to
OI (0.04±0.04), OV (0.04±0.02), and VP (0.0±0.0).
Data are mean±SEM.
Conclusions: Maternal administration of oral
indomethacin increases fetal pulmonary ET-1 levels, an
effect that may be responsible in part, for pulmonary
hypertension. Increased NO production may be a
compensatory response to the ET-1-induced vascular
tone. Vaginal indomethacin does not appear to have
similar effects on NO and ET-1 despite elevated big ET-
1 and cGMP.

Background and Aims: Tumor necrosis factor–
(TNF– ) is one of the main cytokines of inflammatory
- 196 -
and immunological response. It displays cytotoxic
activity by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
in cell, which disturbs prooxidation - antioxidation
balance, thus causing oxidative stress which initiates
lipid peroxidation processes. The latest research proved
that ROS are involved in the regulating of ICAM-1 and
PECAM-1 expression on the endothelial cells. In the
present study, we examined an effect of oxidative stress
(determining by malonyldialdehyde content) induced by
TNF– on ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 expression on
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).
Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were
cultured in a standard medium (M 199). The culture
cells were incubated for 6 hours with a TNF– (10, 20,
40 ng/ml). In the HUVEC lysate, malonyldialdehyde
(MDA), marker of fatty acids peroxidation, was
measured by HPLC method. Expression levels of
ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 were quantified by flow
cytometry.
Results: It was proved that MDA content in the control
culture cells was 12,92±1,02 nmol/mg protein. In the
cultures stimulated by TNF- in concentrations 10, 20,
40 ng/ml, MDA content increased to 14,34±1,05;
16,48±1,21 and 17,39±3,01 nmol/mg protein
respectively. In the control culture cells expression of
ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 amounted to 28,4±0,55% and
20,9±0,35% respectively. After HUVEC stimulation
with 10, 20, 40 ng/ml TNF– , expression of ICAM-1
and PECAM-1 increased statistically significantly to
65,1±3,76 and 80,4±3,32; 70,0±3,94 and 83,4±2,27;
73,1±5,30 and 86,5±0,69 respectively for ICAM-1 and
PECAM-1.
Conclusions: Tumor necrosis factor– induced ICAM-1
and PECAM-1 expression on HUVEC by generating of
oxidative stress.

Background and Aims: High glucose concentrations
disturb oxidation-reduction reaction leading to the
increase of reactive oxygen species production. ROS are
involved in ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 expression on
endothelial cells. Erythropoietin displays cytoprotective
effects. We examined an influence of oxidative stress
induced by high glucose concentrations on ICAM-1 and
PECAM-1 expression and an effect of Epo.
Methods: Some HUVEC were pretreated (24 hours)
with Epo (20 IU/ml). The control culture cells and the
cells from Epo were incubated for 48 hours with glucose
in concentrations 5,5; 11,1 and 22,2 mmol/l. In the
HUVEC lysate malonyldialdehyde, was measured by
HPLC. Expression of ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 were
quantified by flow cytometry.
Results: In the cultures stimulated by glucose
(concentrations: 11,1 and 22,2 mmol/l), MDA content
increased form 12,92±1,02 (control culture) to
18,15±1,26 and 21,50±2,49 nmol/mg protein
respectively. It was significantly statistically higher than
MDA content in the cultures pretreated with Epo
15,06±1,12 and 18,98±1,56 nmol/mg protein
respectively. 60+60+45After HUVEC stimulation with
glucose (concentrations: 11,1 and 22,2 mmol/l)
expression of ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 increased from
28,4±0,55 to 29,6±3,99 and 47,2±4,80 for ICAM-1 and
from 20,9±0,35 to 26,2±3,33 and 44,88±5,16% for
PECAM-1. It was significantly statistically less than
ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 expression in the cultures
pretreated with Epo 60,1±2,61 and 58,1±2,46% (11,1
mmol/l of glucose) and 60,4±1,51 and 57,9±1,24%
(22,2 mmol/l of glucose) respectively.
Conclusions: Erythropoietin inhibits oxidative stress
induced by high glucose concentrations. High ICAM-1
and PECAM-1 expression on HUVEC pretreated with
Epo is a consequence of higher stimulation activity of
Epo in comparison to high glucose concentrations.

Background and Aims: Magnesium sulfate is
nowadays suggested as a neuroprotective agent in
VLBW. We evaluated whether they might have an
effect on lipid peroxidation of erythrocytes membranes.
Methods: The study groups consist of neonates
( 1500g) born from mother receiving prenatally
magnesium sulphate (n=24) and control group (n=20)
without MgSO4. Lipid peroxidation in erythrocyte
ghosts was determined as thiobarbituric acid reacting
substances (TBARS). We have compared the TBARS
level assessed in umbilical blood cord and after 24h of
life. Simultaneously, the differences in neonatal
outcome between antenatally exposed to MgSO4
neonates (n=78) and control group (n=293) VLBW
neonates were analyzed.
Results: After the birth, the mean Mg2+ serum
concentration in control group was 0.73 mM, and
1.27mM after 24 h of life. In MgSO4-treated group,
these values were 1.13 and 1.38, respectively. In
erythrocyte membranes of control group the amount of
TBARS was twice as high (mean 1,84; and 1.99 after 24
h) as in Mg-treated newborns during examined period
- 197 -
(mean 1.21 and 1.34 /10 g of protein, respectively). A
statistically significant correlation was found between
antenatal Mg treatment and BPD (r= -0,23, p<0,001) as
well as severe IVH (r=-0,18, p<0,05; only in group
1000-1500g). These observations were confirmed by
multiple logistic regression analysis which also revealed
that both BPD and severe IVH were negatively
associated with Mg-administration.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that prenatal
administration of magnesium sulfate significantly
altered lipid peroxidation measured as a TBARS. It is
possible that observed effect could explain the reduced
rate of BPD and severe IVH in magnesium treated
group. Supported in part by the Grants no. 5P05E 09224

Background and Aims: Bronchoscopy is probably
under-used procedure, usually because its diagnostic
potential in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is
underrated. The study was carried out to evaluate the
contribution of flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FFB)
and BAL to the clinical management of patients in a
NICU. Setting and design: A retrospective study based
on medical records in a nine-bed NICU of a tertiary care
hospital.
Methods: Twenty seven procedures were performed,
for the following causes: search for airways anatomic
pathologies (7); treatment of atelectasis and installation
of surfactant (6); BAL (7), noisy breathing (2), aid to
difficult intubation (1), aid to difficult extubation (3) and
tracheotomy evaluation (2).
Results: Eleven procedures had more than one cause.
Airway pathology was observed in 11 procedures. BAL
results changed antimicrobial treatment in 4 of 7 cases,
with clinical improvement in 3 cases. Treatment of
atelectasis was successful in 6 of 6 cases. No procedure-
related mortality, life-threatening complications, or
significant changes in patient status occurred.
Conclusions: Anesthesia and mechanical ventilation
make FFB so safe that the NICU patient must be
gravelly ill, or have gross reduction in his respiratory
reserve, before bronchoscopy becomes dangerous. FFB
should be considered to be a NICU staff expertise.
POSTNATAL CHANGES OF PULMONARY

University of Debrecen, Hungary
Background and Aims: Haemodynamic impact of
ductal shunting occurs earlier than clinical symptoms
develop. Timing of PDA treatment remains
controversial.
Methods: We conducted a prospective analyses in
infants who were 29 weeks of gestation. In 24 infants
(mean: 760 g, 25.5 weeks) serial echocardiography were
performed on 1,2,3,7 postnatal days, and when PDA
was clinically suspected. The diameter of ductus
arteriosus (DA) was assessed, and pulmonary vascular
resistance (PVR) was estimated (velocity of tricuspid
and pulmonary insufficiency, pulmonary acceleration
time, direction and velocity of ductal shunting). PDA
treatment was indicated when clinical or
echocardiographic signs of volume overload were
present. We collected data on presence of IVH grade I-
IV and BPD. Patients were divided into two subgroups
at the end of study period: infants who later developed
PDA necessiating treatment (group I, n=8) and who
didn’t (group II, n=16).
Results: No infant found with elevated PVR on the 3rd
postnatal day. That time occurance of ductal diameter
above 1.5 mm were 75% in group I. On contrary we
found only one infant with PDA (1.2mm) in group II.
BPD and IVH grade I-IV were more common in group I
than in group II (62.5% versus 31.25% and 50% versus
25%).
Conclusions: In ELBW infants PVR falls in much the
same time frame as in full-term infants, on the day 3
PVR is low. DA diameter measured on day 3 can predict
persistent ductal patency. Symptomatic, or even some
forms of presymptomatic PDA treatment given later
than day 3 may be ineffective in prevention of PDA
associated adverse outcomes.

Background and Aims: It is proposed that endothelial
cell dysfunction, as a central pathogenic feature of
preeclampsia is caused by circulating unknown factors
produced by placenta in the blood of women with
preeclampsia. In this study we investigated the effect of
such factors in the serum from preeclamptic mother or
her neonatal umbilical vein on the activity of sICAM-1
and apoptosis in cultured human umbilical venous
endothelial cells.
Methods: Quantitive determinations of sICAM-1 and
apoptosis were detected from isolated and cultured
HUVEC supernatants which were incubated with serum
samples for 48 hours. The serum samples were collected
from preeclamptic mother and her neonatal cord blood
- 198 -
in pairs according to gestational age and were
compaired to nonpreeclamptic control groups.
Results: 1) sICAM-1 levels was significantly higher
levels in the maternal groups compared to corresponding
cord groups (P<0.001). The preterm maternal groups
showed higher levels than term maternal groups
(P<0.001). The preeclamptic preterm mother groups
showed elevated level compared to other mother groups
and the existence of preterm delivery affects sICAM-1
level more importantly than the existence of
preeclampsia. 2) In TUNEL stain: Preeclamptic preterm
mother group showed increased number of apoptotic
nuclei compaired to other groups. The neonatal cord
groups of preterm preeclampsia showed no apoptotic
body on cultured HUVEC.
Conclusions: Unknown circulating factors in
preeclamptic preterm mother activate expression of
sICAM-1 and apoptosis in cultured human umbilical
venous endothelial cells. But the fetal circulation may
not be affected by the factor(s) that lead to disturbed
endothelial cell function in women with preterm
preeclampsia.
IBUPROFEN TREATMENT OF PATENT
DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS IS ASSOCIATED WITH

Department of Woman and Child Health, Karolinska
Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden
Background and Aims: PDA-treatment with ibuprofen
has been associated with little renal function
impairment. We assessed urinary function during
ibuprofen treatment, in a clinical setting.
Methods: 83 infants (mean GA 27 wks, SD=2 wks)
with echocardiographic PDA-diagnosis received
ibuprofen (10+5+5 mg/kg). Pharmacological closure
rate was 80%.
Results: There was a transient reduction in renal
function after the first and second dose (Table 1). After
the third dose, renal function was not different from pre-
treatment values.
Conclusions: Ibuprofen PDA-treatment is associated
with transient renal dysfunction. This decrease in renal
function seems small but surveillance of renal function
is indicated during ibuprofen PDA-treatment.

Department of Woman and Child Health, Karolinska
Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden
Background and Aims: Most published data on
ibuprofen treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
have included few infants born at 23-24 gestational
weeks. We determined PDA closure rates, stratified by
gestational age, in a cohort of preterm infants with PDA,
admitted to Karolinska University Hospital.
Methods: During 2001-2004, 83 consecutive infants
(mean gestational age 27 weeks, SD=2 weeks) received
ibuprofen treatment due to echocardiographically
confirmed PDA. Short term closure was assessed by
echocardiography 18-24 hours after completed
ibuprofen course. Surgical closure rate was assessed at
discharge.
Results: Short term closure was achieved in most
infants, but the rate was lowest (71%) among 23-24
week infants. Relapses were also common in this group.
Final non-surgical closure rate ranged from 57% among
23-24 week infants to 94% among infants born >28
weeks. Accordingly, surgical closure rates varied
between 43% to 6%.
Conclusions: Short term PDA closure with ibuprofen
was achieved in most infants, but final non-surgical
closure rate was low among infants born at 23-24
weeks. Whether optimized ibuprofen treatment
strategies, such as earlier initation of treatment, could
decrease surgical closure rate among the most immature
infants remains to be determined.

Background and Aims: Prophylactic treatment with
prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors (PSI) can
unnecessarily exposes infants to a drug. Alternative to
routine prophylactic use of PSI is early treatment of
patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The aim of the study
was evaluation of prognostic value of early
echocardiographic study with respect to PDA in later
life.
Methods: 60 preemies with mean birthweight 1087g
were included into prospective study. The cardiac scans
were performed at the entry into the study (at the age
12-48 hour of life) and further in case of suspicion of
PDA or obligatory at the 7th and 28th day of life. There
was no prophylactic or treatment use of PSI during the
study. Newborns were divided into 2 cohorts: With
significant left to right shunt requiring ligation of PDA
(n=16) or without significant PDA (n=44).
- 199 -
Results: At the entry into the study the mean internal
diameter of DA (2.6 vs 0.9 mm/kg;p< 0.01), mean CI
Ao (2.96 vs 2.37 l/min./m2;p< 0.01) and fE (43 vs
34m/s;p= 0.02) were significantly higher in the treated
group. There was no difference in mean values of other
echocardiographic parameters studied. Sensitivity,
specifity, predictive value of selected variables were
presented in the table.
Conclusions: Early echocardiographic study possesses
negative predictive value for persistence of DA and by
this means can help to avoid unnecessary use of
prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors in VLBW infants.

Background and Aims: Aim of the present study was
to analyse the influence of in utero exposure to smoking
on peripheral oxygenation in healthy term neonates.
Methods: 13 term healthy neonates with in utero
exposure to smoking were compared to 13 term healthy
neonates without in utero exposure to smoking.
Measurements were performed during first week of life.
Neonates were matched for gestational age, actual
weight and postnatal age at time of measurement.
Peripheral oxygenation was measured by near infrared
spectroscopy (NIRS) in combination with the venous
occlusion method on the left forearm. Fractional oxygen
extraction (FOE) and tissue oxygenation index (TOI)
were analysed. Central and peripheral temperatures were
measured continuously. By means of pulsoximetry heart
rate and peripheral arterial oxygen saturation were
measured continuously. Arterial blood pressure was
measured before and after venous occlusions.
Results: FOE tended to be higher and TOI tended to be
lower in the group with in utero exposure to smoking
(0.38±0.07;66±6%) compared to the group without in
utero exposure (0.34±0.06;63±9%). FOE and TOI did
not change with age in the group with in utero exposure
to smoking and, whereas FOE increased and TOI
decreased significantly with increasing age in the group
without in utero exposure. There was no significant
difference between the two groups in birth weight, arm
circumferences, arterial blood pressure, arterial oxygen
saturation and heart rate.
Conclusions: In these preliminary results healthy term
neonates demonstrated influence of in utero exposure to
smoking on FOE and TOI in the first week of life.
BIRTHWEIGHT AND GESTATIONAL AGE ARE
PREDICTORS OF DUCTAL CLOSURE
FOLLOWING IBUPROFEN TREATMENT
G J Richards, A Johnson, G F Fox, M E Campbell
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, St Thomas' Hospital,
London, UK
Background and Aims: Lower gestational age is a
recognised risk factor for the development of a clinically
significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Rates of
successful PDA closure with indomethacin treatment are
reduced in extremely premature infants. There are no
data describing the rate of PDA closure following
intravenous (IV) ibuprofen treatment in the most
immature infants.
Methods: Data were collected on all babies <1000g
birthweight admitted to a tertiary NICU who received
IV ibuprofen for treatment of a clinically symptomatic
PDA. A successful outcome was defined as PDA
closure following a course of ibuprofen treatment, data
were analysed for factors influencing treatment
outcome.
Results: We identified 132 babies who had a PDA
treated with IV ibuprofen, mean birthweight (±SD) was
752±135g and gestational age 25.6±1.4 weeks. The
overall PDA closure rate was 48.5% (64/132). Infants
who failed to close their PDA were significantly lighter
(p=0.012) and less mature (p=0.011). Risk factors
significantly associated with reduced PDA closure rates
were gestational age < 26 weeks (OR 0.23, 95% CI
0.11-0.49; p<0.001); and birthweight <750g (OR 0.30,
CI 0.15-0.61; p=0.002). Neither age at treatment nor sex
significantly affected treatment outcome.
Conclusions: The rates of PDA treatment failure
following a course of IV ibuprofen were 67.2% in
infants <750g birthweight and 68.1% in infants <26
weeks gestation. These data demonstrate that the
efficacy of IV ibuprofen therapy for inducing PDA
closure in this population of high risk babies is both
birthweight and gestational age dependant.

Background and Aims: To assess the cost-utility of
Palivizumab, a prevention against respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV) in children with congenital heart disease
(CHD) in a German health care setting.
Methods: A decision tree model was used to estimate
the cost-effectiveness of Palivizumab. The data sources
included published literature, the Palivizumab pivotal
trials, official price/tariff lists and national population
statistics. The study was conducted from the perspective
of the health care purchaser (HCP) (primary analysis)
and society (secondary analysis).
- 200 -
Results: From the perspective of the HCP, the
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was
€5,013/quality adjusted life year (QALY) without
discounting; and was €18,266/QALY discounted. The
results from the societal perspective were substantially
more cost-effective. The ICER was €2,615/QALY
without discounting, and €9,529/QALY with
discounting. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed
the robustness of the model.
Conclusions: This study showed that Palivizumab
provides a cost-effective prevention against RSV
infections in children with CHD in Germany.
SURGICAL PDA LIGATION ACUTELY
REDUCES VENTILATORY REQUIREMENTS IN
BABIES <1500G BIRTHWEIGHT
S A Hoodbhoy, H Cutting, M E Campbell
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, St Thomas' Hospital,
London, UK
Background and Aims: A patent ductus arteriosus
(PDA) is associated with increased pulmonary
morbidity in premature babies. There are few published
data describing the acute effects of PDA ligation on
ventilatory status in this population.
Methods: Mechanically ventilated infants <1500g
birthweight undergoing surgical PDA ligation were
studied. Acid-base variables, ventilatory and
haemodynamic data were collected pre-operatively, then
at 3 and 24 hours post ligation.
Results: 32 infants were studied, mean (±SD)
birthweight 761.6±170g, gestation 25.6±1.4 weeks and
age at surgery 33.7±12.9 days. There were no significant
changes in pH, PaCO2, lactate or mean blood pressure
over the study time period. Ventilatory parameters
significantly decreased following surgery (see Table).
Conclusions: These data demonstrate a significant
decrease in mean airway pressure within 24 hours of
PDA ligation. These changes likely reflect improved
pulmonary compliance consequent upon reduced ductal
shunting.

Augustin, St. Augustin, Germany
Background and Aims: Acute myocardial infarction in
preterm and term neonates usually is a rare event
associated to a high mortality rate. Apart from neonatal
myocarditis and anatomical malformations of the
coronary arteries it may occur after thromboembolic
occlusion of the coronary arteries.
Methods: We report on two neonates with acute left
heart failure after myocardial infarction due to
thromboembolic occlusion of the left coronary artery
(LCA).
Results: In both cases the diagnosis could be
established via immediate echocardiography at the
bedside. Rapid onset of systemic thrombolysis with r-
TPA after cardiopulmonary resuscitation succeeded in
restoration of the myocardial function. In the first case
recurrent thrombi at the apex of the left ventricle and
adherent to the atrioventricular septum occurred. In the
other case the thrombus could be dissoluted entirely.
Both infants developed arrhythmias, i.e. complete AV-
block as well as ventricular and supraventricular
extrasystoles. The first patient died in terminal heart
failure after futile intensive care management including
inotropes and antiarrhythmic drugs while the
arrhythmias of the second infant could be treated
successfully. In both cases no underlying thrombogenic
disorder could be detected.
Conclusions: Due to the foudroyant course of cardial
decompensation the verification of an acute myocardial
infarction in the neonate is often only detectable in
postmortem examination. Immediate echocardiography
at the bedside may reveal thromboembolic occlusion of
the LCA as a possible cause. Systemic thrombolysis
with r-TPA is estimated to be the only curative therapy.
Furthermore, a rapid initiation of advanced intensive
care management is mandatory.

Sciences University, Isfahan, Iran
Background and Aims: The aim of study was
determination of the effect of deep massage method on
weight gain of LOW infants.
Methods: This is a quasi experimental study which was
conducted on 54 LOW infants in hospitals was
conducted by convenient sampling method. They were
assigned to two groups of 27 infants. One of the groups
received deep massage respectively. This group was
compared with a control group receiving no massage.
Criteria for inclusion in the study were: birth weight
<2500g, age <18 days, breast-feeding, the Iranian race,
absence of diseases. Data was collected through
observations, interviews and measuring weight by
special scales of infants weighing (seco). Each infant in
the treatment group received deep massage for three 15-
minute periods, 30-45 minutes after feeding in the
morning, afternoon and evening for 10 consecutive
days. Weight of infants was measured in the beginning
of the study and 10 days after it. To data was analysis by
t-test and paired t-test.
Results: The groups did not differ significantly on
matched variables. Means of weight gain within groups,
before and after of the study were statistical different.
Also t test showed a significant difference between two
- 201 -
groups. The treatment group was significantly gaining
weight better than control group.
Conclusions: These findings show that deep massage
enhances weight gain in low birth weight infants. Thus,
it can decrease infant's mortality and morbidity, the two
most important indexes of health in the world.
RELATION BETWEEN FAMILIES
FUNCTIONING AND SELF CONCEPT, A
COMPARATIVE STUDY IN HIGH SCHOOL
BOYS AND GIRLS OF ISFAHAN (IRAN)
M Golchin
Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Isfahan Medical
Sciences University, Isfahan, Iran
Background and Aims: Determining relation between
families functioning and self concept in high school
children.
Methods: The study was done according to cross
sectional backward manner. 892 male and female
students were chosen randomly from different high
schools of the Isfahan city. They filled out
Questionnaire for Self Concept based on Rajers
character test and also BLOOM Questionnaire for
family functioning. Family functioning were classified
in three levels: good, intermediate, and poor. They also
were classified according to their normal distribution of
normal condition of society including one SD Data were
analyzed by SPSS using Spearman Coefficient
correlation and t test.
Results: Most of boys described level of family
function to be good (41%), and most of girls (37.4%)
reported the same item to be intermediate. Results of t
test showed that family functioning for girls and boys
were significantly different (t=-7.4, P = 0.016), also
results of Spearman Coefficient correlation showed
significant relation between family functioning and self-
concept of youth (r = - 0.4, P<0.0001).
Conclusions: This study confirms the Significant
difference between family functioning for high school
girls and boys, may be due to self-sense of limitation for
girls or their sense about family attention to boys, so
they are falsely unsatisfied. This study confirms reverse
relationship between family functioning and self-
concept; we found that the more desired family
functioning, the more desired would be self-concept and
the above findings are compatible with other findings in
setting like this.

Background and Aims: Children are increasingly
being exposed to genetic information, but how they
make sense of genetics, or how best to communicate
with children about genetics, remains unclear. Thus, this
study examines children’s perceptions of genetic
illnesses and understanding of probabilistic information.
Methods: Children’s perceptions of genetics were
explored through a write-and-draw task. A probabilistic
choice task including label, percentage, ratio and pie
chart formats examined understanding of probability.
One condition included a mixture of formats.
Results: 106 children aged 7.01 to 11.06 years old
completed the probabilistic choice task. Age
significantly affected understanding of all formats,
except from percentage. 10-11 year olds understood pie
charts better than other formats whilst mixed formats
significantly decreased understanding (p<.001). 7-9 year
old children understood labels, percentages and pie
charts significantly better than ratios (p=.001) or mixed
formats (p=<.001). Thirty-seven children completed the
write-and-draw task. Analysis showed children actively
construct their understanding of genetics, gathering
information from various informal sources. Genetic tests
were predominantly understood as paternity tests which
appeared to be linked to coverage in daytime chat-shows
that children watched. Children evidenced learning the
language of genetics, but their understanding often
lagged behind their vocabulary.
Conclusions: Format significantly affects
comprehension of probabilistic information. All children
understood pie charts the best. The write-and-draw task
provided vital insights into children’s understanding and
possible anxieties regarding genetics, highlighting the
influence of media in the development of such
knowledge. This study represents an important first step
in understanding how to communicate with children
about genetics.
THE MAGIC OF THE WORDS: THE IMPACT OF
STORYTELLING ON SICK CHILDREN

Copenhagen, Denmark
Background and Aims: Children and their parents need
all possible support to cope with the challenges they
face through long term treatment. Storytelling have a
comeback, which has inspired to let two professional
storytellers, 'The Blue Witch' of 'Bowler Granny', tell
stories for sick children. The aim of the study was to get
experience with the impact of storytelling on severe sick
children. An intermediate aim was to stimulate the
children's desire for reading, and to give both children
and their parents a coping strategy through their long
term stay at the hospital.
Methods: Data was collected through observations and
videoshuts of the episodes with storytelling, and from
questionnaires to the parents, and the logbooks of the
storytellers. The target group were children between 3
and 9 years old, who spoke Danish, and who were
treated for a severe, acute or chronic, disease. Data was
collected through 3 weeks. 5 children were followed in
between 3 and 8 story episodes (13 hours of
videotaping).
- 202 -
Results: Children, parents and staff found that
storytelling had an important impact on the child's
wellbeing and coping with the hospital stay. Storytelling
increased the quality of the contact between children
and their parents. Some children formulated their
difficult situation, by engaging themselves in forming
the story. Parents read more books for their child, than
they did before. The staff found that the method was
useful in their spare contact with the child.
Conclusions: The pilot study point at storytelling as
meaningful coping strategy for children suffering from
serious diseases and further investigation is relevant.

Faculty of Nursing, University of Athens, Greece
Background and Aims: Today, some people still
address children with disabilities with prejudice that
leaves them with unhappy feelings. This problem
becomes more intense when health professionals and
especially nurses have not the proper sensitivity and
attitude toward them. We aimed to study perceptions
and attitudes of nurse professionals and nursing students
towards children with disabilities.
Methods: The study population included 228 (52%)
first year nursing students, 90 (20%) postgraduate
nursing students 123 (28%) nurse professionals who
work in pediatric hospitals in Athens. Participants have
answered the questionnaire of Yuker, Block and
Younng. Statistical analysis was performed with
statistical package SPSS 13.0 and has included t-test and
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).
Results: The mean age of first year nursing students
was 17,8 years, of postgraduate nursing students 27
years and that of nurse professionals 35,3 years. Of the
participants 81% (n=359) were women. Women
presented with more positive feelings toward the
children with disabilities compared to men (p=0,04).
Postgraduate nursing students were more positive
toward disabled children compared the other two groups
(p=0,00), while the attitude of first year nursing students
was more positive compared to that of nurse
professionals (p=0,047). Age did not have statistically
significant relation.
Conclusions: Nurse professionals, despite the fact that
they come more often in contact with handicapped
children, maintain more negative attitude toward them
compared with the other two groups. There is a need for
constant systematic informative intervention in order to
achieve better social acceptance of children with
disabilities.

University Hospital, Hillerod, Denmark
Background and Aims: In Denmark sick newborns and
premature infants are separated from their mothers (and
fathers) when admitted at NICU/PICU. This has been
practise in the past and still is. Parents do not in all
NICUs have unlimited access to their infants. When
transported in ambulances they are not allowed either.
The aim for most Danish NICUs care is that parents
should have an unlimited access, to their children. We
suggest that this will enable the parents to obtain self
confidence in abilities to take care of their child, and
thus be able to act and decide advocating their child's
best interests. As a result the families regain the
autonomy and their parental competence, which was
disturbed by hospitalisation in NICU.
Methods: A national SIG-group organized under The
Danish Paediatric Nurse Association, has during the last
years had focus on facilitating the implementation of
Family Centred Care. As a group we have taught and
informed about this subject, during national conferences
and teaching sessions using expert nurses, psychologist,
master NIDCAP-Trainers, family- therapists and
hospital priests.
Results: We have noticed an increased attention
towards the subject and there has been an overwhelming
participation at our courses both in number and quality
of debate.
Conclusions: Considering the ideal of 'family centred
care' we recognize there is still a long way to go in
changing 'ward cultures' as well as physical realities
(including room for a mothers bed with her infant or
child). However we consider NICU care in Denmark
moving forward in the right direction.
NURSING ATTITUDE TOWARDS END OF LIFE
DECISIONS – HOW WE DEAL WITH IT!
M Cicak Novak, M Novak
Division for Neonatology and Intensive Care,
Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Center
Zagreb, Croatia
Background and Aims: Most deaths in pediatric
intensive care unit are not unexpected; they follow
limitation or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment
(LST). The nursing stuff attitude towards such decisions
between nurses in neonatal, pediatric, adult
neurosurgical intensive care unit, and general pediatric
ward was investigated.
Methods: A prospective, descriptive study based on a
survey was conducted. A questionnaire was sent to
nurses from all the mentioned divisions. The attitude
about active/passive euthanasia; nursing care at the end
of life; pain management; symptom management;
ethical/legal issues; cultural and especially religious
consideration in end-of life care; communication with
parents/family and family presence; grief, loss, and
bereavement; achieving quality at the end of life. The
opinion about nursing role in LST withdrawal decisions
was investigated.
- 203 -
Results: Summary statistics is presented.
Conclusions: Uniformly, most of the participants
considered active euthanasia as an at least unacceptable
practice, but opinions about LST withdrawal differed
significantly between nurses in pediatric/neonatal units,
general pediatric wards and adult units. Interestingly, the
opinions about nursing role in LST withdrawal decision
making differed between the groups, but between the
members of the groups, too.
PARENTING IN NICU
L W Wellejus, B Pallesgaard
Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark
Background and Aims: In Denmark the parents are
alowed in the NICU 24 hours a day. The staff offer a lot
of time, teaching the parents how to nurse their infant
meening bathing the infant, changing the diper, taking
care of the tubefeeding and many other things. The
parents learn all these things very early in the pathway.
This means that the infant very ealy are nursed mainly
from their parents hands.
Methods: Even very sick infants will be nursed and
held by their parents as much as possible. It is very
important for us, that the infants as erly as possible are
taken out of the incubator to lay on their mothers or
fathers chest, so they can share the feeling of one-
anothers skin ('kangaru-method'). We do that even with
infants in the respirator. In very rare cases, where the
infants need to stay in the incubator (eg. with thorax-
drains), we teach the parents how to sit by the incubator
with their hands quiet around the infant.
Results: By having the parents in the unit as much as
possible, continuity is gained regarding who is touching
and handling the infant and the parents are ealy in the
infants life, which in many ways is a caotic beginning of
life for the sick ore premature born infant. Another good
thing is that the milk-production increases, so the
mother are able to give her own milk to her own baby.
Conclusions: Many advantages for both infants and
parents physically, psychologically and socially.

T Moreno, C Schüffelmann, F Ruza
PICU, La Paz Children's Hospital, Madrid, Spain
Background and Aims: To evaluate the end-of-life
care in a PICU from parental and staff point of view, to
compare perceptions, and to get information to design
proper guidelines.
Methods: Parents of patients died from 2001 to 2003
and staff completed one questionnaire designed to test
the information, the environment, the accuracy of care
in the moment of death, and bereavement care.
Results: A total of 43 PICU workers (69%) filled the
questionnaire. Finally, 29 questionnaires were obtained
from interviews or mail (30% of possible). Parents
judged information better than staff, especially (p<0,05)
relating therapy choices, understanding, and prognosis.
Around 80% of respondents demanded one only
spokesman. Near 60% of respondents thought that
visiting time was not sufficient, parents are informed of
imminent death for a not familiar doctor, and parents
guess that children are going to die before being
informed of this possibility. Seventy-six per cent of
parents judged as positive to be by their children's side
when died versus 35% of staff (p<0,05). Almost 75% of
staff states that withdrawal of life support is raised not
often enough. Seventy-two per cent of staff thinks that
psychological support is necessary for parents, vs. one
third of parents.
Conclusions: We have got a complete perspective of
the end-of-life care we provide. We have identified
skills and pitfalls about of information, family role,
emotional support for families and staff, and withdrawal
of life support. We have tried to use this information to
improve by several actions, including the design of a
clinical pathway for end-of-life care.

Background and Aims: Aim of this study is to focus in
problems arising in families with children suffering
from chronic diseases
Methods: In total 17 families were studied in Thrace,
Greece. A questionnaire was completed assessing
children and parents’ everyday problems. A special
concern was given to brothers and sisters of children
with a chronic disease. We did not ask any questions to
the young patients themselves.
Results: In total, 21 healthy children of the study
families were asked, with a median age of 10,4±2,7
years old. The 90% accepted that the sickness of their
brother/sister had affected dramatically their lives.
“Living like - ill” was the referred problem by 77% of
children. The 34% had been bothered by the special life-
style determined by numerous Hospital admissions of a
family member, while 60% had noticed a big share of
parents care was always missing. A 5% stated that they
were afraid of getting sick and die. Parents’ answers
were matching to their children impressions, as they
accepted that the psychological impact on their families
was crucial for their lives. Behavioral problems (~50%),
development and learning difficulties (25%) of the
healthy children were reported. All parents accepted that
they were incapable to provide equal attention and care
to their children.
Conclusions: Family care should be given in families
with children suffering from chronic diseases. General
Doctors, social workers and Hospital services might be
the ideal functional parts of the unsolved puzzle.

CAN PALLIATIVE CARE OUTREACH OFFER
AN ALTERNATIVE TO PICU?
A P Anderson, F Craig
Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: Clinicians have a duty not to
ask families to consent to a treatment that does not have
a realistic chance of recovery. We investigate the scope
for a palliative care outreach service and determine if
this may help children and families avoid inappropriate
PICU admission.
Methods: A retrospective case note review of children,
known to the palliative care service, who were referred
to PICU, by their local hospital during an acute illness.
Results: Over a two year period, six children, known to
the palliative service, between 2-18 months prior to the
acute presentation at their local hospital, were identified.
Treatment of acute deterioration had been previously
discussed with all families. Two had agreed to a 'do not
resuscitate order' (DNR). The remainder said they would
only make a decision when the time arose. Palliative
care service was contacted directly by five local
hospitals and in one case by the family. Palliative care
provided outreach to all 6 families on the day of request
and each case was discussed with PICU. In two cases,
admission was felt to be appropriate. The two admitted
to PICU were both discharged home within 48hrs. Of
the remaining four children: 3 died in their local hospital
and one survived their acute episode. At follow no
families regretted their decision.
Conclusions: PICU should be offered when there is a
realistic chance of a reversible component of the acutely
presenting symptom or illness. Involvement of palliative
care, as an outreach service, during an acute episode,
can prevent inappropriate PICU admissions.

Background and Aims: The oropharyngeal
colonization of critical care patients has been described
as capable of increasing nosocomial infections. The
oropharynx is usually considered the main reservoir of
bacterial colonies in the upper airways. The aim of this
study was to verify the oropharyngeal colonization of
children at the first 24 hours of admission in a PICU.
Methods: Prospective study realized in a University
Hospital PICU in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. The
study was approved by the ethics research committee.
The sample was composed of 32 children.
Microbiological cultures were obtained during the first
24 hours after children's admission, and collected
swabbing by tonsils and pharyngeal areas. The collected
oropharyngeal secretion were inoculated on culture
media and incubated according to atmosphere,
temperature, time and humidity standards.
Results: The children presented an average of 3.6 years
old, 62.5% were male, and 78.1% received mechanical
ventilation. Pathogens were identified in 12 (37.5%) of
the 32 oropharyngeal cultures analyzed. The pathogens
identified in this cultures were: Klebsiella pneumoniae
(21.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (21.4%), Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (14.4%), Enterobacter spp (14.4%),
Escherichia coli (7.1%), Proteus mirabillis (7.1%),
Acinetobacter baumanii (7.1%) and Morganella
morganii (7.1%). Clinical characteristics were analyzed
according to the identification of Normal (NF) or
Pathogenic Flora (PF): Length of stay in hospital
(NF18.0 days; PF26.7 days) and PICU (NF5.7 days;
PF8.2 days); elective (NF76.5%; PF23.5%) or
emergency (NF46.7% ; PF53.3%) admission; clinical
(NF55.5%; PF45.5%) or surgical (NF75.0%; PF25.0%)
diagnosis.
Conclusions: The main pathogens identified were gram
negative and presence of pathogenic flora increased
hospital and PICU length of stay. Acknowledgments:

CLINICAL UTILITY OF THE
MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASSESSMENT PAIN
SCALE
A S Ramelet
School of Nursing and Midwifery, Curtin University of
Technology and Nursing Research, Princess Margaret
Hospital for Children, Perth, WA, Australia
Background and Aims: Even if an assessment tool has
sound psychometric properties, if it is not feasible for
use in a clinical setting or does not provide useful
clinical information, then it is of little value to
clinicians. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical
utility of the Multidimensional Assessment Pain Scale
(MAPS) for critically ill young preverbal children.
Methods: Usefulness of the MAPS was tested in a
convenience sample of 19 children aged between 0 and
31 months who had major surgery at a tertiary referral
hospital in Western Australia. The other components of
clinical utility, such as ease of use, format and scoring,
were evaluated by 17 staff nurses who completed an
anonymous 5-point Lykert type scale questionnaire.
Results: MAPS scores decreased significantly by 4
points (40% of total score) after the administration of a
potent dose of morphine (p<0.001). Internal consistency
of the MAPS was poor (Cronbach’s alpha 0.26), but
would increase to 0.80 if the physiologic item was
deleted. However, the actual decreases of heart rate,
systolic, mean, and diastolic arterial pressure after a
potent bolus of morphine (p<0.001) suggested that this
item should be modified rather than deleted. The MAPS,
as evaluated by 17 nurses (57% response rate), proved
to be clinically useful, with a median of 2 (range 4) in
all components.
Conclusions: This study showed that the MAPS is
sensitive to analgesics and clinically useful, yet the item
“vital sign” required some amendments. For clinical
application, it is recommended to use the revised version
of the MAPS.

G N Feketea, A J Patsoura, A G Eliades, D D Gionis,
J H Papadatos
PICU, “P.&A. Kyriakou” Children’s Hospital, Athens,
Greece
Background and Aims: Despite advances in antibiotic
therapy strategies and in pediatric intensive care,
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia remains a serious
infection.
Methods: Treatment, complication and outcome of
children with severe Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia
were reviewed.
Results: Eight children (age 1-29 months) were
identified with S. aureus pneumonia over the 3-year
study period (1,3% of all admission). The mean age was
7,25 months (range 1-29), 5/8 children-under 3 months.
Two children (25%) were presented with CA-MRSA.
Reasons for ICU admission were respiratory failure –
hypoxemia (8/8), convulsions (2/8), and septic shock
(3/8). Three children required inotropic support but none
patient had endocarditis. Renal failure was not occurred.
A coagulopathy was seen in 5 children on presentation.
5/8 children required mechanical ventilation for mean
10,8 days (range 4-26). Despite aggressive treatment
with Teicoplanin or Vancomycin (4/8) two children died
while 3/8 children had complications requiring
prolonged antimicrobial therapy. Teicoplanin or
Vancomycin was the initial treatment in 4/8 cases and
few hours later in the other 4/8. The decisions were
taken when susceptibility results were known or due to
poor clinical course. Six children presented
pneumothorax and/or pleural empyema witch needed
drainage, 5 by thoracocentesis and 1 by thoracotomy.
Conclusions: Initial empirical antibiotic treatment for
infant with suspected pneumonia and/or pleural
empyema for which S.aureus is a possible pathogen,
should include an agent that is active against the CA-
MRSA. Infants under 3 months old with S.aureus
pneumonia need usually PICU. Aggressive drainage of
purulent collection or surgical incision and drainage of
large empyema is preferable.

(IBIMET-CNR), Florence, Italy
Background and Aims: Emerging concern exists about
possible health effects of climate change. Summer 2003
is known as the hottest in the last 400 years in Northern
Europe. Although a possible effect of high air
temperature on TSH levels has been previously reported
in experimental models, to date no information exists on
this phenomenon in human newborns. We tested the
hypothesis that neonatal blood TSH concentrations on
day 3 are inversely related with the air temperature, as
assessed on a congenital hypothyroidism (CH) mass
screening program.
Methods: Whole blood T4 and TSH concentrations on
day 3 were evaluated in 32,091 newborns in South-
Eastern Tuscany, Italy, sampled from January 1999 to
December 2003. Monthly air temperatures for 9 weather
stations covering the geographical area of birth were
obtained from the regional database. Cases with proven
CH or other known thyroid diseases were excluded from
the study. T4 and TSH concentrations on filter paper-
adsorbed whole blood specimens (DELFIA) were
evaluated.
Results: Year 2003 was associated with decreased
median TSH concentrations as compared to the
preceding years (p=0.003), and significant relationships
between monthly TSH and temperature (minimum: r=-
0.5438, p<0.0001; median: r=-0.5066, p=0.0001;
maximum r=-0.5260, p<0.0001) were observed. By
contrast, no significant relationship between blood T4
and environmental temperature was evidenced. TSH
was found to be thermostable at 47 C for 7 days.
Conclusions: Our findings indicate relationship
between high environmental temperature and early low
neonatal TSH concentrations. The observation reveals a
previously unrecognized, possible direct effect of
climate change on human health, whose possible long-
term consequences need to be investigated.

Background and Aims: Preterm birth is followed by an
immediate decrease in circulatory levels of IGF-1. The
aim of the study was to evaluate effect of intravenous
administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) on levels of
IGF-1 in preterm infants.
Methods: FFP from adult donors was administered to
17 infants (mean GA 25.5 wks) at a median (range) age
of 3 (1-29) days. Serum IGF-1 was analyzed in
administered FFP, in neonatal blood before and after
FFP transfusion, and 6, 12, 24 and 48 h later.
- 206 -
Results: FFP was administered with a mean (SD)
volume of 10.9 (2.0) ml/kg during 90-240 min. Mean
(range) IGF-1 concentration in administered FFP was
127 (77-171) ng/ml. Immediately after FFP
administration, mean levels of IGF-1 had increased from
12 to 26 ng/ml (p<0.001). Mean levels of IGF-1
remained higher at 6 h (16 ng/ml) (p=0.003) and 12 h
(16 ng/ml) (p=0.012) after transfusion, as compared
with levels before transfusion. Mean (SEM) levels see
fig.
Conclusions: Infusion of plasma in neonates elevates
IGF-1 levels to a variable degree during 12 but not 24
hours. The results may serve as a basis for further
studies on the role of IGF-1 as a neuro- and
vasoprotective agent in preterm infants.

Background and Aims: Definition of optimal levels of
blood glucose in newborns remains controversial. Very
Low Birth Weight (VLBW) infants are at a higher risk
for disturbances in glucose homeostasis. Hypoglycaemia
may worsen neurodevelopmental outcomes, while
hyperglycaemia contributes to risk of intraventricular
haemorrhage and sepsis. Our aims were to study actual
levels of blood glucose in VLBW infants and to validate
a method of continuous glucose monitoring in these
patients.
Methods: Extremely premature VLBW infants
receiving intensive care were recruited within the first
24 hours from delivery. A subcutaneous sensor
connected to a Continuous Glucose Monitoring
System® (Medtronics) was maintained during 7 days or
until dysfunction. Management of patients followed
usual standard protocols.
Results: 38 patients (20 male and 18 female) were
included over 17 months. Mean gestational age was
27,58 2,06 weeks. Mean weight, length and cranial
circumference were 962,22±199,47g, 35,85 2,90 cm
and 25,24 1,96 cm. Perinatal history and complications
were the usual in extremely premature babies.
Continuous monitoring lasted an average of 7,84±1,99
days per patient. Hyperglycemia was detected in 22
(57,90%) patients and lasted a mean of 20,33±30,13
hours, while 14 (36,8%) presented with hypoglycaemia,
for a mean of 2,45±2,3 hours. Some of these values
were not detected by intermitent sampling.
Conclusions: Continuous glucose monitoring reveals
frequent alterations of glucose levels in VLBW infants,
more than expected by intermittent capillary sampling.
Further studies should clarify relevance of hyper and
hypoglycaemia in short and long term outcomes of
premature babies. Real-time continuous glucose
monitoring may be useful in management of VLBW
infants under intensive care.

Background and Aims: There's a lack of clinical
information as regard to the incidence and etiology of
neonatal pneumonia due to uncertainty of case
definitions, rate differences in patient populations, and
ascertainment bias. To establish the incidence and
investigate the common infectious etiologies of non-
nosocomial neonatal pneumonia in northern Taiwan.
Methods: This is a retrospective study by reviewing
medical records from 2000 to 2005. Those who had the
diagnosis of pneumonia with disease onset prior to or
upon admission, or no later than the first 96 hours of
hospital stay, who also had simultaneous laboratory
studies for infectious microorganism and changes on the
chest x-ray, were included in the study. They were
divided into early and late onset pneumonia, indicating
pneumonia in infants younger and older than 48 hours of
age.
Results: The total admission to NICU was 11000 for the
study period. There were 223 non-nosocomial
pneumonia (2.0% of NICU admissions), 35 of them
early and 188 late. In the early pneumonia, they were all
of bacterial origin, including Gr. B streptococcus (GBS)
(16), Staph. Aureus (5), E. coli (3), Listeria (3). In the
late pneumonia, there were 123 by RSV, 16 by
Chlamydia, and 49 (26%) by bacteria: Non-typable H.
influenzae (12), E.coli (12), Staph. Aureus (10), and
other pathogens (15).
Conclusions: The results of this study serve as valuable
guides for selecting antimicrobial agents for non-
nosocomial neonatal pneumonia. All the early and 26%
of the late onset neonatal pneumonia are caused by
bacteria, in which GBS and nontypable H. Influenzae
are the leading causes.

Background and Aims: Despite beneficial effects of
neonatal Dexamethasone (Dex) in preterm infants with
chronic lung disease on the short term, there are
multiple side-effects such as transient myocardial
hypertrophy and hypertension. We reported a temporary
suppression of cardiomyocyte proliferation in neonatal
rats after neonatal Dex, possibly inducing persistent
alterations in cardiac morphology (Basic Res Cardiol
2006). Our aim was to perform histopathological
investigations after neonatal Dex in the juvenile and
adult rat heart.
Methods: Rat pups received Dex on day 1, 2 and 3 of
life (0.5, 0.3 and 0.1ug/g ip). Control pups received
saline (Sal). At 4, 8 and 50 week of life the rats were
sacrificed (n=8/group). Anatomic data were collected
and heart tissue sections were stained with HE,
Cadherin-PAS and Sirius Red for cardiomyocyte
morphometry and collagen determination.
Results: Cardiomyocyte length of the Dex-treated rats
was significantly increased compared to control in all
three age groups. In the 8- and 50-week-old Dex-treated
rats this was associated with an increased cross sectional
area and volume, indicating cellular hypertrophy.
Collagen content increased with age and was higher in
the Dex groups (only significant at 50 weeks).
Conclusions: Neonatal Dex affects normal growth of
the heart resulting in hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes and
increased collagen deposition in the adult rat heart.
Previous studies in rats have shown premature death and
suggested cardiac failure. Therefore cardiovascular
follow-up for preterm infants treated with
glucocorticosteroids is mandatory.
MELATONIN AND RETARDATION OF CNS
DEVELOPMENT IN IUGR NEWBORN INFANTS

Department of Physiology and Pathology of Newborn of
D.O. Ott Research Institute of Obstetrics and
Gynecology RAMS, St. Petersburg, Russia
Background and Aims: The aim of this study is to
assess the role of melatonin (MT) in pathogenesis of
retardation CNS development and perinatal pathology in
IUGR newborn infants.
Methods: Clinical and laboratory investigations with
electropoligraphic characteristics of the cycle
organization of sleep were performed in 112 IUGR and
63 normal full term neonates (control group).
Expression of MT in platelets and their aggregation
activity were investigated. Excretion of the main MT
metabolite 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (6SMT) in diurnal
(09.00 to 21.00 h) and nocturnal urine (21.00 to 09.00 h)
in 1, 4, 10 days of life were determined.
Results: The results showed that the excretion of 6SMT
was significantly lower in IUGR neonates in diurnal and
nocturnal urine (4,5±1,0 ng/ml and 3,6 ±1,1 ng/ml) than
in the control group infants (14,1±2,2ng/ml and 7,7 ±1,7
ng/ml respectively) during first 10 days of life. Platelet’s
expression of MT was lowed and their aggregation
activity was increased in IUGR neonates which had a 2-
4 week delay in the formation of passive, active tonuses
and an inborn reflexes. It combined with the non-
differentiated state in the sleep structure and correlated
with functional disturbances of CNS, hemodynamic
disorders and microcirculation in lungs. Retardation of
psychomotor development took place by the end of the
first year of life.
Conclusions: MT as the neurotransmitter and
endogenous antioxidant plays an important role in the
adaptation to hypoxia and development CNS function in
early ontogenesis. It may potentially be useful for
restore and development CNS function in IUGR
neonates.

Background and Aims: Respiratory distress syndrome
(RDS) - severe consequence of prematurity leads to
further complications including persistent ductus
arteriosus (PDA). The goal of the study is to test
hypothesis that severity of RDS increases risk of PDA in
VLBWI.
Methods: 51 VLBWI admitted to Neonatal Intensive
Care Unit till the second day of life between January
2004 and October 2005 were included into study group.
Blood gases were checked on admission and in day 3,
pulsoximetry saturations (SpO2) were continuously
recorded during first week of hospitalization. Chest X-
ray (CXR) was taken on admission, the severity of RDS
was graded (scale 0-4). Echocardiographic evaluation of
hemodynamic significance of PDA was performed in
day 1 and 7, the study group was divided into PDA (-)
- 208 -
and PDA (+). SpO2, FiO2/pO2, pH and severity of RDS
in CXR were compared in both groups.
Results: Results are shown in the table.
Conclusions: PDA (+) patients revealed higher grade of
RDS in CXR, lower: pO2/FiO2 in day 1 and pH in the
day 3. They also had longer and deeper episodes of
desaturations. The severity of RDS increases risk of
PDA in VLBWI.
VOLUME OF ACTIVITY AND NURSES'
STAFFING LEVEL IN NEONATAL INTENSIVE
CARE UNITS. RESULTS OF A REPEATED
MEASURE CROSS SECTIONAL STUDY IN
ITALY

Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Bambino Gesù Children's
Hospital, Rome, Italy
Background and Aims: Volume of activity and staff
workload in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs)
could be relevant to the quality of care and outcome of
high risk infants. The aims of our study were to describe
the distribution of some variables reflecting the volume
of activity of Italian NICUs, and to investigate the
relationship between these variables and the staffing
level.
Methods: One hundred and four NICUs participated in
a nationwide investigation from May to December 2005.
The following data were collected monthly at specified
points in time, representing both weekdays and
weekends, and including all possible nursing shifts:
Number of ventilated or NCPAP-cared infants
(intensive patients, IPs), Number of nurses in the
intensive care section (ICN) of each NICU, and Infant to
Staff ratio (ISr), calculated dividing IPs by ICN.
Medians and Interquartile ranges (IQR) of each variable
were calculated, and their distribution and possible
variations over time were assessed.
Results: The distribution of the relevant variables did
not vary significantly over time; therefore pooled data
were used for further evaluation. Medians (IQR) were: 2
(1.12-3.31) for IPs; 2 (1.50-2.69) for ICN; and 1 (0.65-
1.50) for ISr. The mean values of ISr were 0.44, 0.92,
1.26, and 1.74, respectively, from the lowest to the
highest quartile of IPs’ distribution (p<0.05, Bonferroni
test).
Conclusions: In Italian NICUs the Infant to Staff ratio
is less favourable when the volume of activity is high,
suggesting an inefficient distribution of human
resources.
BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) WAVES ARE DUE TO
NORADRENALINE SURGES IN NEWBORN
INFANTS
B Wefers, S Cunningham, J Quinn, N McIntosh
Department of Neonatology, University of Edinburgh,
Edinburgh, UK
Background and Aims: Maintenance of BP within a
'normal range' is important for perfusion of vital organs
and avoidance of perfusion related insults to the
neonatal brain. Hypertensive neonatal BP waves have
been described by our research team and have been
linked to more severe neonatal illness. An increased risk
of cerebral pathology in these infants has been
postulated. However the mechanism behind these waves
remained unclear (Cunningham et.al., 1993). We
investigated plasma catecholamine levels when
hypertensive BP waves were observed.
Methods: Trained clinical staff notified the investigator
when hypertensive BP waves were seen on the
computerised trend monitoring system (CPTM). Blood
samples were taken at the peak and trough of BP waves
from the indwelling arterial line used to monitor the
infant's BP. Catecholamine levels were analysed using
High Performance Liquid Chromatography with dual
electrode coulochem detection. Mean BP recorded by
CPTM at the time of sampling was correlated to plasma
adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine levels using the
Wilcoxon signed ranked test.
Results: In 5 infants (7 paired samples) the mean BP
and noradrenaline levels were significantly correlated
(p=0.021), while mean BP and dopamine levels were
not (p=0.487). Adrenaline was mainly undetectable. The
association between plasma noradrenaline levels and
mean BP was independent of absolute plasma
noradrenaline levels and concurrent therapeutic
dopamine infusion (2 infants).
Conclusions: Hypertensive BP waves in neonates are
induced by a surge in plasma noradrenaline; the reason
for this surge has not been elicited.

Background and Aims: The development of pediatric
intensive care (IC) has contributed to improved survival
in critically ill children. Little is known about long term
physical sequelae in pediatric IC survivors, but they
might resemble the findings in adult IC survivors.
Awareness of sequelae due to the original illness and its
treatment may result in changes in management during
the acute phase. The purpose of this study was to
evaluate physical sequelae of survivors of Pediatric
Intensive Care Units (PICU).
Methods: From December 2002 through October 2005
all acute admissions to our PICU, were examined in the
- 209 -
out-patient follow-up clinic, three months after
discharge. A pediatric intensivist evaluated physical
sequelae by standardized history taking and physical
examination.
Results: 116 of 250 eligible patients were evaluated.
Patient characteristics, PIM II score, length of stay and
length of mechanical ventilation did not differ
statistically significant between participants and non-
participants. 55 patients suffered a chronic illness after
discharge. Ten patients complained of concentration
disturbances, 17 of behavioral problems, and 10 of
sleeping problems. Nine of 40 school-age children had
problems at school. Neurological abnormalities were
seen in 24 children, post thrombotic syndrome after a
central venous catheter in 3 and hoarseness after
extubation in 3 children.
Conclusions: PICU survivors have various, but
substantial physical sequelae three months after
discharge. Almost 50% of patients have a chronic illness
and almost 20% of patients have neurological problems.
Further research is warranted to determine risk factors
and methods to prevent sequelae due to intensive care
treatment.

Background and Aims: Overall mortality in PICU is 4-
7%, but the mortality in the group children with a length
of stay of more than 1 month (> 4 times median duration
of stay) might be much higher.
Methods: Children up to the age of 18 who fulfilled the
criteria of prolonged stay (> 28 days) were included in
our University children's hospital and multidisciplinary
intensive care unit. The design was a retrospective
analysis over a 3-year interval (2003-2005).
Results: A total of 120 children (equal gender) had a
prolonged stay. Mean length of stay was 82 days (range
29-500). The mean age was 2 years (range 0-18 years).
Main underlying diagnoses were congenital: heart
diseases and gastrointestinal diseases and acquired and
congenital malformations of the airway with a total of
48% of all admission days. Thirty two children died
(26%), mean hospital stay until death 75 days (range 30-
220). Among the nonsurvivers, 5 of 32 children were
withhold from life support. In 15 of 32 cases the
terminal event preceding death was withdrawal of life-
sustaining treatment.
Conclusions: Children with prolonged stay at the ICU
have a higher unexpected incidence of mortality. A
multidisciplinary management approach of the care and
cure for these children is needed to reach maximum
opportunities. We suggest the institution of
multidisciplinary staff meetings after a prolonged stay of
28 days, which are automatically announced by our
patient data management system in order to reach better
medical insight and to determine guidelines and
boundaries of future treatment modalities.
ORGAN DONATION FROM A PEDIATRIC
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT IN GREECE
F C Nikolaou, K G Papazoglou, J H Papadatos
Intensive Care Unit, Children's Hospital 'P&A.
Kyriakou', Athens, Greece
Background and Aims: Current demand for organs far
surpasses availability all over the world, waiting lists are
long and many people die before the organ they
desperately need becomes available. The purpose of this
paper is to estimate the number of potential donors and
the organ donation/transplantation rate in the pediatric
population.
Methods: All deaths in the PICU at the Children
Hospital “P & A Kyriakou” during the last ten years
were checked for brain death (BD). These patients were
valued as possible organ and tissue donors. The number
of donors and the causes for not donation were
estimated.
Results: During the study period 191 children died, of
whom 101 (52.8%) were confirmed as brain stem death.
The main cause of BD was the traumatic brain injury
(TBI) (39.6%). Potential organ donors were 47 (46.5%)
and 23 (22.8%) were potential tissue donors. Medical
contraindications to organ donation had 31 (30.7%).
Donors according to update criteria became 11 children
(15.7%). The main causes of no-donation were:
(a) death during the first day of admission in PICU
(11.4%) (b) family’s refusal (14.5%) (unfamiliar idea,
religious causes) (c) judicial reasons (5.7%) (child
abuse) (d) inability in approach the donor family (53%)
(14 organ donors and all tissue donors).
Conclusions: Children with TBI are the most frequently
BD potential donors. The organ donation rate could
increase with the reduction of losses due to donor
management (further work in medical stuff), reduction
the family’s refusal (education in school and
community, publicity) and increase the family’s
approach.

Children’s Hospital AMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Admission to a Pediatric
Intensive Care Unit (PICU) is a stressful event
associated with both psychological and physical long
term consequences. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD) has been frequently mentioned as a
psychological consequence. The purpose of this study
was to examine the prevalence of PTSD in families after
an acute PICU admission and to determine the
- 210 -
contribution of different medical risk factors to the
development of PTSD.
Methods: From December 2002 through October 2005
we did follow-up research in the Emma’s children’s
hospital, Amsterdam. Families filled out PTSD
questionnaires three months after discharge. A total of
143 families participated in this study with 27 children
older than 8 years, 140 mothers and 107 fathers.
Results: Data-analysis showed that in total 9 (33.3%) of
the 27 children had scores in the clinical range (scores
38) meaning further treatment is indicated. From these
9 children 3 (11.1%) met the criteria for severe PTSD
(scores 47). For parents, the complete triad of PTSD
clusters could be diagnosed in 15.0% (n = 21) of the
mothers and 9.3% (n = 10) of the fathers. In 6 families
PTSD was diagnosed in both parents. Furthermore the
analysis showed no associations between the PTSD
scores in families and the medical risk factors.
Conclusions: An unexpected admission to a PICU is a
stressful event associated with a heightened risk for
developing PTSD in families. These results underline
the importance of systematic psychological follow-up
research in the PICU. Further research is necessary to
identify risk factors for PTSD in families.

Children, Glasgow, UK
Background and Aims: ECLS is an established therapy
for neonates with a high risk of death from respiratory
failure and is available in 4 UK centres. No standardised
criteria for initiating ECLS transfer exist although the
oxygenation index (OI) has been used historically. Aim:
To review factors influencing the mortality of infants
transferred to Glasgow as potential candidates for
ECLS.
Methods: A retrospective case note review
incorporating the West of Scotland Neonatal Transport
Database. Factors influencing survival were identified
using bi-variate correlation. Binary logistic regression
was used to identify independent determinants of
survival. SPSS® was used for all analyses.
Results: Fifty-two infants were referred to the Glasgow
ECLS between March 2003 and March 2006, 49 of
whom were subsequently deemed suitable for transfer.
No deaths occurred during transfer. Referral diagnoses
included Meconium Aspiration Syndrome (n=16),
Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn
(n=17), Septicaemia (n=4), and Congenital
Diaphragmatic Hernia (n=7). Thirty infants (61%)
subsequently received ECLS. Of the 49 infants
transferred 86% (n=42) survived to discharge. No
clinical or laboratory factors were identified that
significantly predicted survival. In particular, indices of
oxygenation at the time of referral (OI r=0.04, p=0.76;
FiO2 r=0.10, p=0.94), base hospital blood gas
parameters and arrival blood gas parameters did not
predict survival.
Conclusions: Numerical predictors of illness severity,
such as the OI, are poor determinants of survival
following ECLS. The condition of the infant, based
upon clinical experience, must remain the best indicator
of need for transfer.
END-OF-LIFE DECISIONS AND

Childrens Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Many neonatologists in
European countries set limits to intensive care treatment
(Cuttini, 2000). In Belgium and The Netherlands
approximately 60% of all deaths are preceded by an
end-of-life decision (Provoost 2005 and Vrakking
2005). The end-of-life decision is sometimes followed
by the use of drugs to alleviate pain and discomfort. A
retrospective and prospective study to get more insight
into reasons for withdrawal and medication prescribed
was performed.
Methods: Many neonatologists in European countries
set limits to intensive care treatment (Cuttini, 2000). In
Belgium and The Netherlands approximately 60% of all
deaths are preceded by an end-of-life decision (Provoost
2005 and Vrakking 2005). The end-of-life decision is
sometimes followed by the use of drugs to alleviate pain
and discomfort. A retrospective and prospective study to
get more insight into reasons for withdrawal and
medication prescribed was performed.
Results: The proportion of neonatal deaths (2002-2004)
that were preceded by end-of-life decisions was 61/119
(51%). Drugs to alleviate pain and discomfort were used
but most patient files did not give exact information
about medication dosage or its clinical effect. In the
prospective study of 2005 (Jan-Sept) 42 infants died, in
26 (61%) an end-of-life decision was made. 22/26
(85%) patients received drugs to in the period after
withdrawal of treatment.
Conclusions: The practice of end-of-life decisions in
neonates is stable. Drugs seem to be used more
frequently in 2005, which might be caused by improved
registration or an increase in use because of an altered
attitude towards suffering around death.

- 211 -
Background and Aims: Acute pain caused by common
minor procedures, such as venipuncture, can be a major
source of distress for hospitalized children. Our
objective is to explore the efficacy of a mixture of
lidocaine and prilocaine cream [Eutectic mixture of
local anesthetics (EMLA)] and of other social
parameters such as educational status in reducing pain
during venipuncture.
Methods: 97 children aged from 3 to 14 years old, who
were hospitalized and required venipuncture, were
enrolled in a randomized, single blind placebo
controlled trial. They were randomized in two-treatment
groups 1) EMLA cream, 2) placebo cream. Either
EMLA or placebo cream were applied 60 minutes
before the procedure. Children rated the pain using the
revised Wong- Baker Faces pain scale with scores
ranging from 0 to 10.
Results: Age was found to be high correlated with pain
score (p-value <0,001), which was also found to be
statistically significant higher in children in the placebo
group (p<0,001). Children accompanied by mothers
with university education experienced less pain than
those with mothers of elementary education (p=0,022).
Finally it is interesting that 10,8% of the children of the
EMLA group reported pain scores >8 while 32,6% of
the children of the placebo group reported pain scores
<2.
Conclusions: EMLA is effective in minimizing
procedural pain during venipuncture with better results
in older children who have mothers with university
education. However the final outcome is affected by
various individual factors and it is difficult to be
predicted in advance.
A CASE OF ACCIDENTAL STAGGERED
PARACETAMOL OVERDOSE

Department of Paediatrics, Whiston Hospital,
Liverpool, UK
Background and Aims: Liquid paracetemol
formulations are available in 120mg/5ml dosages over
the counter in UK. With their common usage in
children, parents assume that doses abroad are the same.
This can lead to accidental overdose with therapeutic
intent.
Methods: Case Report.
Results: A 14 months old boy was admitted with three-
day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. On closer
questioning the parents reported that during their
holiday in Spain one week previously, Spanish hospital
prescribed paracetamol (fig1) containing 100mg/ml to
control the pyrexia. As the written instruction and the
explanation of the dosage were in Spanish, the parents
did not understand clearly. They had therefore been
giving 5 ml of Spanish concentrated paracetamol
assuming that it contained only 120 mg. This child
weighed 10.4Kg; therefore he was receiving nearly
300mg/Kg/day of Paracetamol. He was treated with N-
acetylcysteine, as advised by the National Poisons
Information Service (NPIS).
Conclusions: Accidental overdoses have been reported
with 'therapeutic intent'1, 2. This case highlights the
importance of taking a full drug history in every patient
including not only how much has been prescribed, but
how much has actually been taken. In a society where
holidays abroad are very common, this also highlights
the need for good communication between the doctor
and patient especially if it is in foreign language.

Background and Aims: Atypical auditory event-related
potentials (AERPs) of preterm infants correlated with 2-
year development (Fellman et al. Pediatr
Res.2004;56:291-7). We compared the 5-year AERPs
and neurocognition to infant AERPs.
Methods: Preterm small (SGA, n=13; birthweight
844±287 g, 28.1±2.3 gestational weeks, gw) and
appropriate for gestational age (AGA, n=14; 1002±236
g, 27.0±1.9 gw), and control (n=13; 3856±466 g,
40.3±1.6 gw) children were assessed at 0, 6, 12 months,
and 5 years with a frequency odd-ball using a standard
100-ms harmonic tone of 500-Hz, and a deviant tone of
750-Hz of fundamental frequency. At age five novel
sounds representing environmental noises were added.
The full-scale intelligence quotient (FS-IQ) of the
preterm children was assessed (WPPSI-R).
Results: The FS-IQs (mean±SD) were 97±24 (SGA)
and 98±16 (AGA). Positive peak amplitude at 100 ms
both to frequency and novel deviants were smaller in
SGA than in controls (P<0.001 and P<0.04), and tended
to be smaller than in AGA (P<0.07 and P<0.06).
Negative peak at 250 ms to novel sound tended to be
more negative in SGA than in AGA (P<0.08). Negative
peak at 250ms correlated inversely (P<0.05) with FS-IQ
- 212 -
to frequency deviant in electrodes Cz (r=-0,51) and Pz
(r=-0.45) and to novel sound in C3, C4, and Pz (r=-0.43
to -0.44). Preterm had smaller amplitude responses than
control children to standard stimuli and frequency
deviants at latency windows 150-250 and 250-350 ms at
different study ages.
Conclusions: AERP abnormalities may suggest
different pattern of brain maturation in preterm children.

Background and Aims: Children with cerebral palsy
(CP) had varieties in the temperaments and
developmental functions. This study investigated the
relationships of developmental functions and
temperaments in children with CP.
Methods: We collected 126 children with spastic CP
and 66 children with normal-development children, aged
3-6 years. Children with CP were divided into 3 groups:
Hemiplegia (n=21), diplegia (n=60), and quadriplegia
(n=45). All children completed Chinese Children
Temperamental Inventory (CCTI) (9 temperament
dimensions), and Chinese Children Developmental
Inventory (CCDI) (8 functional domains) assessments.
Children with CP also received assessments of CP
classification and Gross Motor Functional Classification
System (GMFCS). The one way ANOVA and
correlation analysis were used for statistical analysis. It
was considered as statistically significant if P <0.05.
Results: Children with CP showed lesser approach and
persistence, lower adaptability, and higher responsive
threshold than control group (p<0.05). And children
with spastic quadriplegia showed lower adaptability and
lesser persistence than CP with diplegia or hemiplegia
(p<0.05). Correlation analysis showed development
quotients (DQs) of all developmental functions were
highly correlated with GMFCS scales and CP
classifications (p<0.01). The DQs of most
developmental functions were positively correlated with
adaptability and persistence (p<0.05), and were
negatively correlated with responsive threshold
(p<0.05).
Conclusions: Some temperaments varied in children
with CP having different classifications. The CP
severity and classification played dominant roles in
determining all developmental functions in children
with CP. The temperaments, particularly adaptability,
persistence, and responsive threshold, were also related
to most developmental functions.

Background and Aims: Prolonged seizures during
development may cause permanent dysfunction of
neurons and mossy fiber sprouting, resulting to long-
term cognitive dysfunction. Inhibition of NO production
is suggested to result in both neuroprotection and
neurodestructive outcome. Our aim is to examine the
implication of NO in long-term neurological
disturbances, caused by hypoxia/kainic acid induced
prolonged seizures.
Methods: Wistar rats (10-11-d-old) were divided into 4
groups: A, B, C and D (control) A, B, C groups were
subjected to hypoxia, induced by decreasing O2
concentration from 7% to 4% within 15 minutes. At
P21-P22, rats of groups B and C were administered with
KA (10mg/kg i.p.) Animals of group C were pre-treated
with 7-Nitroindazole (50mg/kg i.p). Visualization of the
mossy fibers sprouting was examined with Timm
staining at PND75. Cognitive function was assessed
with the passive avoidance and the water-maze tests for
5 consecutive days, at PND 65 and 70, respectively.
Results: In the passive avoidance test, the 7NI group
presented better performance compared with the H/KA
group, particularly the last day of trials. In the water-
maze test, all the examined groups significantly
improved their performance during the trial period and
especially 7NI group reached the level of control
groups. According to Timms staining scores, 7NI
attenuated the mossy fiber sprouting during adulthood.
Conclusions: Our findings indicate that hypoxic
seizures during development followed by prolonged
seizures at later stages cause axonal growth and
neurological dysfunction and suggest that NO may
modulate seizure-induced hippocampal mossy fiber
sprouting and play a role in long-term disturbances,
observed in cognitive function.

Background and Aims: Prognosis at school age of
fetuses with IMVM, defined as cerebral ventricles with
a 10-15 mm atrial diameter, remains unknown, despite
conjecture that there is functional deterioration with age.
To study the outcome for school age children that had
been diagnosed prenatally with IMVM.
Methods: We studied 25 cases of IMVM obstetric
diagnoses from the ultrasound lab archives. After birth,
isolated VM was confirmed in 23 cases; in 2 cases VM
was associated with periventricular leukomalacia and
Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, respectively. We
were able to contact 21 out of 25 patients for follow-up.
Outcome was assessed at age 6-8 years with the
Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children and the test of
Visuo-Motor Integration (VMI) in 14 children and in 7
others by structured telephone interviews.
Results: Mean (SD) IQ and VMI score were 110.8
(12.1) and 110.6 (14.9), respectively in 12/14 children;
2/14 children, in which VM resulted not isolated after
birth, were not evaluable due to severe psychomotor
deficit. All the 7 children analyzed by telephone had a
normal psychomotor development, good school
performance and no need for a supporting teacher.
Conclusions: Of the 21 children followed at school age,
19 (90.5%) showed normal outcome while 2 (9.5%),
where VM was not isolated after birth, showed severe
psychomotor delay. Our results suggest that there is no
functional deterioration with age associated with
confirmed postnatal diagnosis of IMVM. These data are
very useful in helping counseling parents with a fetus
affected by IMVM.

Tashkent, Uzbekistan
Background and Aims: The significance of the
problem of early identification and medico-social
rehabilitation of children with minimal brain
dysfunction (MBD) is explained by growing worsening
of the state of nervous-psychic health of children,
including increase in frequency of intellectual and
speech deviations. Purpose: To identify and study risk
factors of MBD in children of young school age.
Methods: Investigation was carried out on 57 patients
with MBD and 20 healthy children aged from 3 to 5
years. Studying of pre- and perinatal medical history of
patients and healthy children the pathological factors
were the following: anemia in mother during pregnancy
(64% and 59%), toxicosis (52% and 47%), pathological
labors (29% and 8%), risk of pregnancy interruption
(20,5% and 12%), frequent respiratory diseases (8,8%
and 3,6%), group of Rh-factor (2,3% and 0%), birth
injury (33,7% and 17%), gestosis (8,8% and 3,3%).
Results: Studying of medical history of healthy children
showed the presence of above-mentioned risk factors
but of less severity. Anemia and toxicoses of mothers
during pregnancy were almost similar both in group of
study and healthy children. However, in group of sick
children in the medical history there was noted
additionally risk factors with birth trauma of different
severity degree which, probably, in combination had
reliable unfavorable effect on pregnancy and labor
outcome.
Conclusions: Analysis of data obtained allowed to
conclude that for development of MBD the combination
of some factors but not single are of importance that
requires from neurologists, neonatologists and
pediatricians to concentrate their attention for
management of this category of patients.

Background and Aims: Posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) describes a syndrome of distress that develops
after exposure to events or circumstances that involved
actual death, injury or a threat to the physical integrity
of oneself or others. This study examined prospectively
posttraumatic stress symptomatology in relation to
neuroendocrine and inflammatory factors after the event
in children and adolescents hospitalized for road
accidents
Methods: 60 children and adolescents involved in
motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) were studied
immediately after hospitalization, and at 1 month and 6
months later. Both parents and self-reported instruments
were used: Children's PTSD–Reaction Index and
Kiddie-SADS semi-structured interview. Serum cortisol,
interleukin-6 and plasma catecholamine concentrations
were measured with appropriate methodology.
Furthermore, salivary cortisol was measured in samples
collected serially five times a day.
Results: a) 38% of victims presented with PTSD at the
1 month assessment and 20% at the 6 month follow-up.
b) Salivary cortisol concentrations at 12.00, 18.00 and
21.00hrs were significantly elevated (p=0.034, p=0.006
and p=0.007) immediately after the accident, in those
who subsequently developed PTSD at the 1 month
assessment. Salivary cortisol levels at baseline were
even higher in those presented with PTSD 6 months
later: (12.00: p=0.003, 15.00 hrs: p=0.014, 18.00 hrs:
p=0.004 and 21.00 hrs p=0.000). IL-6 concentrations
after the accident were elevated in those who developed
PTSD 1- and 6-months later (p=0.003 and p=0.0001
respectively).
Conclusions: Increased evening and night salivary
cortisol and/or increased serum IL-6 concentrations
- 214 -
immediately after the accident, could be predictive
markers of subsequent PTSD development in children.

Background and Aims: Causes of growth failure in
children with severe neurological impairment remain
often unclear. Our aim was to study, in preterm infants
with cystic periventricular leukomalacia (CPVL), the
prevalence and risk factors of poor growth at 2 years of
corrected age.
Methods: The population consisted of all preterm
admitted to our NICU from 1997 to 2003 with cranial
ultrasound evidence of periventricular cystic white
matter lesions. Growth failure at 2 years was defined, in
infants with weight z score at birth - 2, as z score < -2;
in those with weight z score at birth already < -2, as z
score fall of another standard deviation.
Results: Out of the 26 children who were studied (GA
29.9±2.9 wks, BW1340±530 g) 14 showed growth
failure (W zs -3.2±1.0) and 12 did not (W zs -0.6±0.8).
During the hospital stay, growth retarded infants had
similar baseline characteristics, early growth patterns,
prevalence of intraventricular hemorrhage and grade of
CPVL. During the follow up period, the frequency of
rehospitalization (2.5±0.6 vs 0.75±0.7; p:0.03), oral
feeding impairment (36% vs 0%, p<0.05), and the
proportion of infants not able to walk independently
(50% vs 0%, p<0.05) resulted significantly higher in the
growth retarded group.
Conclusions: At 2 years of corrected age 53.8% of
premature infants with CPVL were growth retarded. In
this population risk factors associated with growth
failure were oral feeding impairment, rehospitalization
and severe motor disability.

Background and Aims: Resolution between colors is
based on E, an euclidean distance in the non-euclidean
perceptual color space. The Farnsworth-Munsell 100
Hue (FM100-H) test is a widely used qualitative tool for
screening and classification of color vision anomalies.
However, the relationship between test performance and
quantitative color variables is unclear. Here, we tested
color vision in healthy children as a function of the
quantitative color variables of different hues in the
FM100-H test.
Methods: Color vision was tested in a total of 41
healthy children aged 9 to 11 years, using the FM100-H
test (Munsell Color Co.), consisting in rearranging in
sequence 85 different color caps according to hue. All
the caps were measured using a portable portable
spectrophotometer unit (400-700 nm wavelengths range;
standard D65 illuminant) and color was expressed in
terms of CIE-L*a*b* and L*C*H* color coordinates.
E values between consecutive colors were computed
using a color software package (Colormedica,
IntexSystem). Test results were expressed as squared
total error sum TES) and percentage of errors in the
sequence.
Results: All children had test results within normal
limits for age TES =9.54±2.29). Error percentage for
single sequences (21,95%, inter-quartile range: 9.7-
32.93) was unrelated to E (rho= -0.001, p=0.9923), L
(rho= 0.040, p=0.7186) a (rho=0.207, p=0.0594), b
(rho=-0.107, p=0.3309) or H (rho=-0.084, p=0.4453),
while was inversely related to saturation differences
( C: rho= -0.297, p=0.0067) between consecutive hues
and color axis (blue-yellow errors> red-green errors,
p=0.0024).
Conclusions: Performance in the FM100-H test is based
on saturation differences between consecutive hues and
axis.

Background and Aims: The prevalence of ADHD
world wide is controversial. Although most studies
place it in 3-5%. Publications in English language
regarding this issue in Arab children are lacking. We
aimed by this study to evaluate the prevalence rate of
ADHD in Israeli Arab school children.
Methods: The instruments we used for screening for
symptoms of ADHD were the ADHD rating scale IV
and the abbreviated Connor's scale. The sample of the
study that was taken included 4639 school children of
both sexes between 6-12 years age from 11 schools in
three locations in the center of Israel. Location I is a
village of less than 10,000 residents, location II is a
small town of 22000 residents and location III is a big
- 215 -
town of 35000 residents. The forms were filled by the
teachers or by psychological consultants and teachers.
Results: The analysis of the data obtained showed high
prevalence of ADHD in these children. It was
22.7%,16.3% and 16.9% in locations I, II, III when the
DSM IV scale was used and 18.3%, 13.2% and 11.5%
when the abbreviated Connor's scale was used,
respectively. Boys scored consistently higher than girls
in both instruments used.
Conclusions: The prevalence of ADHD seems high in
this population and further studies and controlled,
should be conducted to determine the adequate
prevalence of this disorder.

Background and Aims: To explore differences in
background factors and outcome between convulsive
status epilepticus (CSE, seizures lasting over 30
minutes) and shorter convulsions in children.
Methods: Retrospectively reviewed medical records
and treatment charts of all children (up to 16 years) who
had been admitted to the Pediatric Emergency Room or
Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of Tampere University
Hospital, between 1993 and 2002, due to convulsive
seizures lasting over 5 minutes.
Results: There were 187 episodes of CSE and 152
seizure episodes lasting shorter time in 234 children
with mean follow-up time of 2.0 years after the index
seizure episode. CSE associated significantly with acute
and remote symptomatic etiologies (vs. idiopathic or
febrile etiology, p<0.001). Eleven (5.9%) CSE and 39
(25.6%) seizures lasting 5-29 minutes ended
spontaneously (p<0.001). The treatment delay (time
from the beginning of seizure to the anticonvulsive
treatment) was 20 minutes in CSE group and 7 minutes
in the comparison group (p=0.08). Mortality in these
two groups was 1.7% and 0.4%, and new epilepsy
occurred in 12.8% and 20.0%, respectively. Other
neurological morbidity was associated with etiology
(p=0.004) but not with seizure duration.
Conclusions: The etiology of the seizure episode was
the major determinant for neurological outcome and it
was significantly different in CSE group and in 5-29-
minute seizure group. Rapidly induced treatment may
prevent seizure prolongation and the overall outcome of
prolonged seizures in children seems to be good.

Background and Aims: Neonatal encephalopathy due
to perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia is often associated with
alterations in the development of specific cognitive
abilities. This cognitive impairment may only be
recognized when examining specific areas of cognition.
The aim of our study was to examine later
neuropsychological functioning in children who, as
newborns, had been included in the study of different
biochemical markers of hypoxia and ischaemia in the
serum and CSF.
Methods: Twenty-one children who suffered perinatal
hypoxia took part in the study and completed a 9-
neuropsychological-test-battery (WISC-III, WMS-R,
VMI, Rey complex figure, Trail making test, Corsi
block-tapping task, COWAT, Test of verbal fluency and
Stroop colour test). The children were between 11 and
16 years old (average 13). Their neonatal indicators of
perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia included Apgar scores,
ultrasound findings and different biochemical markers
(lactate, lactate dehydrogenase and creatin kinase) in the
serum and CSF.
Results: With regard to reference values, the group of
children included in the study, displayed the most
cognitive deficits in visuo-motor skills and executive
function. Neuropsychological test results correlated with
creatin kinase in the CSF (r = .33) and serum (r = .45),
memory scores being more closely associated with LDH
in the CFS (r = .41, p = .06) and serum (r = .54, p = .01).
Apgar scores and ultrasound findings had less predictive
power.
Conclusion: The results indicate that biochemical
markers of neonatal hypoxia-ischaemia creatin kinase in
CSF and serum and lactate dehydrogenase in the serum
are better long-term predictors of neuropsychological
impairment than Apgar scores and ultrasound findings.

Santa Maria, Santa Maria Hospital, Lisbon, Portugal
Background and Aims: To evaluate age of independent
gait in children with Down Syndrome followed at the
Child Development Department of the University
Hospital of Lisbon.
Methods: Clinical reports of 125 children with Down
Syndrome were retrospectively reviewed for
demographic data, age of mother at birth of child,
- 216 -
chromosome defects, age of beginning of intervention
programme, associated disorders, age of independent
gait and developmental assessment at 12 and 36 months
of age using the Ruth Griffiths Mental Developmental
Scale.
Results: Mean of age of mother at birth of the child was
31.1 years with pre-natal diagnosis in five cases. Mean
age of children at the beginning of the intervention
programme was 9.15 months (in the 78 cases in which
this item was recorded). Mean age of independent gait
was 24.12 months in the entire sample and 25.3 in
children with heart disease (12 of which had heart
surgery). As for development assessment, mean GQ
score at 12 months was 76.14% and 66.4% at 36
months.
Conclusions: No data existed in Portugal concerning
mean age of independent gait in children with Down
Syndrome, but our results are similar to those described
in literature. Presence of heart disease, which could play
delay developmental skills, did not significantly
influence age of independent gait. Probably, on the first
years of life, more time of the intervention programme
should be spent with verbal and non verbal cognition
rather than with motor skills, which come naturally.

Background and Aims: From ancient times people
have considered epilepsy as a very dark disease, also the
people who suffered it. This kind of people have leaved
in a very bad situation because of the people reject, they
have a poor quality of life even if they were childs with
any known about life.
Methods: We applied an Spanish scale to know how do
this patients live, how do they react with the
environment, school, family and doctors. We made a 10-
year-old-study to get as much information as we could
and to know how to work with all those patients.
Results: We find out that CAVE, the scale we used
have to be modified to be able to apply in our country,
because most of the times the results didn't show what
was really happening with these kind of patients or their
relatives.
Conclusions: We suggest that the scale be modified and
apply in all the epileptic patients we see in consults, not
only our group of West Syndrome if it is real that they
were the most affected group, also their relatives.

Background and Aims: Spasticity of lower limbs is a
challenging problem for children with motor impairment
due to cerebral palsy. For many years, treatment has
centered on the use of physiotherapy and orthoses to
overcome these problems. Intramuscular botulinum
toxin (BT-A) offers a targeted form of therapy to reduce
spasticity in specific muscle groups, though the high
cost is a limiting factor for it's ready application in the
developing countries. We tried to compare the
effectiveness of it's different doses to choose the least
expensive regimen which produces the desired effect.
Methods: Forty-five patients with spastic diplegia were
enrolled, and were randomly divided into 3 groups each
with 15 patients. Patients in the first group received 5
units/kg/leg of BT-A, and the patients in the 2nd and 3rd
groups received 10 and 15 units/kg/ leg of BT-A
respectively. The outcome was assessed six weeks later
by video gait analysis, gross motor function measure
(GMFM), and passive ankle dorsiflexion.
Results: Video gait analysis and GMFM showed the
best results in the 2nd group with the 10units/kg/leg
dose. The difference in passive dorsiflexion was not
statistically significant in the 3 groups.
Conclusions: The study gives further support to the use
of intramuscular botulinum toxin as an adjunct to
conventional physiotherapy and orthoses to reduce
spasticity in children with spastic diplegia. Since this
therapy is considered as a relatively expensive treatment
in developing countries, and considering that the best
outcome was seen with 10units/kg/leg of BT-A, we
discourage using higher doses of the drug for these
patients.

Background and Aims: The deformities of the equine
feet of children with CP are the consequences of
contractures of soft tissues. The elimination of these
contractures that would permit increasing the capacity of
movement would favour the development of the motor
system.
Methods: the surgical intervention that I practice to
eliminate the contractures of the soft tissues for 10
years, consists of performing small surgical incisions in
the contracted fibers. In order to carry this out, one uses
a sharp scalpel that allows one to surgically intervene
- 217 -
just subcutaneously. The patient will find the post-
operation to experience very little trauma. In order to
conduct this research, 188 equine feet were operated on
120 children. Traditional methods were used for the
medical research before and after these operations and at
the end of 1-4 years after the operations were
performed.
Results: The results demonstrate that in 181 operated
feet, 90 degrees and less of the angle of the tibia-foot
was decreased. In addition, the surface of the sole of the
foot was increased. Also, the elimination of the pain
syndrome, verticalization of the patients was proven to
improve the balance, the capacity of movement and
displacements. In the remaining 7 feet, beneficial results
were found as well, but to a lesser degree.
Conclusions: This research show that it is necessary
that orthopaedic surgery has an important place in the
treatment of equine feet in order to optimize the
rehabilitation of the children with Spastic Cerebral
Palsy.

Background and Aims: To study the association
between smoking in pregnancy and psychiatric
symptoms in the adolescent offspring.
Methods: 84 adolescents born by women who had been
randomly selected before week 20 of pregnancy as
participants in a multicenter study were examined at age
14 years. At enrolment of the pregnant mothers, 32 of
84 indicated that they were smokers. At follow up the
adolescents’ scores on the Achenbach System of
Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA), Autism
Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), ADHD-
Rating Scale IV and Children's Global Assessment
Scale (CGAS) were recorded. In addition IQ was
estimated through four subscales of WISC-III.
Socioeconomic status (SES) was assessed through
Hollingshead’s Two factor Index, and maternal distress
using the Symptom Checklist-90-R.
Results: Adolescents who were born by smokers had
significantly higher total scores on all instruments when
scored by mother (Table), father or teacher than
adolescents of non-smokers. All caregivers consistently
scored adolescents of smokers higher on the ASEBA
subscores delinquent and aggressive behaviour, and
social problems.
Conclusions: Smoking in pregnancy is associated with
more psychiatric symptoms in adolescence, especially
rule-breaking and aggressive behaviour, and other social
problems.

Background and Aims: Children with cerebral palsy
have functional prognosis dependent mainly on their
neurologic impairment, as long as life expectancy is
related to respiratory complications. We analyzed
respiratory complications of the children with cerebral
palsy admitted in IMCC.
Methods: Retrospective study of a case series of 24
children with cerebral palsy admitted for respiratory
episodes, compared with a control group, age matched,
neurologically unafected. We studied risk factors,
airway protection reflexes, reccurence frequency, long-
of-stay, clinical forms, complications, treatment,
outcome.
Results: The mean age was 62.53 months (0-216), with
sex ratio of 1.4:1 (M:F). See table. These children
presented more severe respiratory infections episodes,
sometimes protracted. Two patients had documented
tuberculosis. Respiratory failure and athelectasis were
the most frequent complications.
Conclusions: (1) Distrophy and abandon are frequently
associated risk factors. (2) Airway protection reflexes
impairment was present in 91.66%; in some cases we
tried to improve them using captopril. (3) Almost 100%
had lower airway infection. (4) High reccurence rate
may lead to antibiotic resistance; in 54.16% expensive
antibiotics were needed (e.g. cephalosporines,
vancomycine). (5) Long-of-stay and parenteral
antibiotic treatment were longer in the study group.
(6) More than two thirds presented at least one serious
complication. (7) Mortality was higher in the study
group.

Background and Aims: A hypoxic-ischaemic insult is
one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in
term infants. To initiate neuroprotective interventions,
early indicators of brain damage are required. The
protein 14-3-3 family are a group of highly conserved
proteins ubiquitously expressed in a wide range of
organisms. In spite of reports in adult animals and
humans, protein 14-3-3 has never been measured
following a hypoxic-ischaemic insult in a newborn
animal experiment. We measured protein 14-3-3 in the
CSF of newborn rats following a HI insult .
Methods: 10-day-old rats were exposed to hypoxia-
ischaemia using the Levine model. CSF was collected
regularly after the insult. A control group was subjected
to sham surgery but not to the HI insult. Protein 14-3-3g
was quantified by Western blotting. The rats were
sacrificed and the brains taken for histological
examination.
Results: In the control group, protein 14-3-3 did not
increase significantly over time. In the study group,
there was a significant increase in protein14-3-3 as early
as 2 hours after the end of the insult, peaking at 4 to 6
hours and returning to basal levels by 72 hours.
Conclusions: Protein 14-3-3 increases in the CSF of
newborn rats following a HI insult. The presence of
protein 14-3-3 in CSF is a good indicator for neuronal
loss or damage. Before protein 14-3-3 may be used to
guide clinicians to accurately predict outcome and time
of an insult to potentially initiate neural rescue therapies,
these results have to be verified in humans and protein
14-3-3 measured in blood.

Background and Aims: Campylobacter jejuni
(C. jejuni) is known as a common causative agent of
acute bacterial gastroenteritis in the world. It is not
distinguishable by a routine coproculture. The
prevalence of C. jejuni among other bacterial agents of
acute diarrhea is investigated in this cross- sectional
study.
Methods: In a period of three months, 114 fecal
specimens were collected from patients aged 2-58 years
with acute diarrhea, referring to Nemazi hospital,
Shiraz, Iran. All samples were tested for identifying
bacterial pathogens causing acute diarrhea.
Results: Of 40 positive samples for bacterial enteric
pathogens, the overall prevalence of C. jejuni was 9.6%
compared to Salmonella spp and Shigella spp with
15.8% and 9.6% respectively. Maximum prevalence of
C. Jejuni was observed in patients aged 11-15. All of
these agents of diarrhea were most frequent in females
(P<0.05).
Conclusions: This study revealed the significance
(P<0.05) of C. jejuni among other bacterial agents of
acute gastroenteritis in Shiraz, Iran.

Background and Aims: Infantil colic is one of the most
commonly encountered problems in the early neonatal
period. Inspite of everything the aetiology of the
disorder is still an enigma. Natural course of the
infantile colic, with a spontaneous disapperance of
symtoms at 3-4 months of age, makes research on this
disorder more difficult than usually. Still, it is a loss that
intestinal function has not been monitored over a longer
period in order to study whether the abnormality persists
later in infancy or childhood.
Methods: Questionnaires.
Results: The occurrence of infantil colic has been
studied at 100 neonates who came for a normal check up
after suffering a neonatal risk period at our department.
Our conclusion about the main reason for the origin of
infantil colic presented was: 1. inadequate interaction
between mother and infant 25%; 2. hypertonicity and
immaturity of gastrointestinal tract 35%; 3. Reaction to
cow’s milk or other food constituens in 50%. According
to the prognosis on the behaviour and temperament
scales the only difference was that the colic infants were
more emotional than the other infants. There were some
basic criteria for association with the infantil colic like:
sleep disorders, fussiness, aggresiveness and mostly
crying. Also they refused certain meals.
Conclusions: We need to make a follow up study in
order to find the clue to the enigma of infantil colic that
probably lies in the physiology of the problem.

Background and Aims: Recent studies from Europe
and the USA indicate that iron deficiency (ID) is present
in approximately 7% of children less than two years old.
- 219 -
Previous prevalence estimates of ID in New Zealand
(NZ) have used hospitalised samples or biased
community samples. The aims were to estimate the
prevalence of ID in NZ children aged 6 to 23 months
and the factors associated with ID.
Methods: An ethnically stratified random sample of
well children aged 6 to 23 months from Auckland, NZ.
Iron status was determined in 380 children enrolled
from 1999 to 2002. ID was defined as abnormal values
for 2 or more of serum ferritin (<10 mg/L), iron
saturation (<10%) and red cell distribution width
(>14%). Logistic regression analysis was used to
calculate odds ratios and from these, relative risks (RR)
& 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated.
Results: ID was present in 24% (95% CI 19-29%). In a
multivariate analysis there was an increased risk (RR,
95% CI) of ID associated with an elevated C-reactive
protein (2.20, 1.02-3.42), low serum vitamin A (2.38,
1.23-3.53), enrolment during summer (2.48, 1.14-3.98),
increased body mass (2.86, 1.32-4.55), breastfeeding
after age six months (2.21, 1.13-3.67), and not receiving
iron-fortified formula (2.08, 1.04-3.30).
Conclusions: ID is prevalent in the first two years of
life in NZ. Seasonal and dietary rather than demographic
factors identify children at increased risk. To reduce the
prevalence of ID in NZ iron supplementation of breast
fed infants and the use of iron-fortified formula past age
12 months should be considered.

Background and Aims: In recent years Vitamin D
deficiency has re-emerged as a child health issue in
Europe, the USA and also the Middle-East. New
Zealand is a sunny country that has never considered the
need for routine vitamin D supplementation. To estimate
the prevalence of low vitamin D in young children and
the factors associated with low vitamin D.
Methods: An ethnically stratified random sample of
well children aged 6 to 23 months resident in Auckland,
New Zealand. Serum 25-hydroxy-vitaminD3 was
measured in 353 children enrolled from 1999 to 2002.
Low vitamin D was defined as less than 27.5 nmol/L.
Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds
ratios and from these, relative risks (RR) & 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were estimated.
Results: Low vitamin D was present in 46 (10%, 95%
CI 7-13%) of 353 children. After adjustment for sunlight
exposure, gestation, number of siblings, household
crowding and income there was an increased risk (RR,
95% CI) of low vitamin D status associated with
enrolment during winter (16.53, 1.02-46.06), Pacific
Island (9.79, 2.74-21.94) or Maori ethnicity (5.80, 1.51-
16.13) and not having any infant or follow-on formula
(6.07, 2.87-9.37).
Conclusions: Low vitamin D is prevalent in the first
two years of life in New Zealand. The prevalence varies
with season. Children of non-European ethnicity and
children who don't receive iron fortified formula are at
increased risk. Infant vitamin D supplementation should
be considered as part of New Zealand's child health
policy.

Background and Aims: Elevated homocysteine levels
have been identified as an independent risk factor for
atherosclerosis. The purpose of our study was to
evaluate the possible effect of growth hormone
deficiency as well as recombinant human growth
hormone (rhGH) replacement therapy on serum
homocysteine (Hcy) levels in children with growth
hormone deficiency.
Methods: 11 children (8 boys and 3 girls) with a mean
age of 10.6±1.98 yrs and established growth hormone
deficiency (<10 ng/ml) on at least two provocative tests
(Insulin, clonidine or glucagon) comprised the study
group. Serum homocysteine levels were measured
before and at 2, 3, 6 and 12 months of rhGH therapy
which was administered at a dose of 0.5IU/kg/week S.C.
All children were instructed to receive the same
appropriate diet for their age for at least 7 days before
blood sampling. The Wilcoxon-signed rank test was
used for comparison purposes.
Results: Our evidence show significantly reduced
homocysteine levels by 12 months of therapy. Results
are summarized on the table.*Data represent median
values.
Conclusions: rhGH therapy significantly reduces total
homocysteine levels by 12 months of therapy. However,
given the small number of patients, further studies will
be required to clarify whether these results may
significantly influence prevention of cardiovascular
disease in adulthood.

Background and Aims: Growth hormone participates
in the regulation of serum lipid and lipoprotein levels.
The study's aim evaluates the possible effects of rhGH
treatment on cholesterol, lipoprotein A and
apolipoprotein A and B levels of children with
established growth hormone deficiency.
Methods: 11 children (8 boys, 3 girls) with a mean age
of 10.6±1.98 yrs and established growth hormone
deficiency (<10 ng/ml) on at least two provocative tests
(Insulin, clonidine or glucagon) comprised the study
group. Serum total cholesterol (HDL+LDL), Lp(A) as
well as apoA and apoB levels were measured before and
at 2, 3, 6 and 12 months of rhGH therapy administered
at a dose of 0.5IU/kg/week S.C. All children were
instructed to receive the same appropriate diet for their
age for at least 7 days before blood sampling.
Results: Our evidence show significantly reduced total
cholesterol levels along with reduced LDL levels and
significantly elevated HDL levels by 12 months of
therapy. Additionally, Lp(A) levels significantly
increase, whereas apoA and apoB remained unaltered.
(See table for results).*median.
Conclusions: rhGH therapy significantly reduces total
cholesterol levels and induces a significant increase of
protective LpA levels. A larger confirmatory cohort
study is under way for verification of the above.

Heraklion, Crete, Greece
Background and Aims: Childhood obesity may be
associated with disorders of thyroid gland. We
investigated the frequency of thyroid dysfunction (TD)
in overweight and obese children.
Methods: We reviewed data from 135 obese and
overweight children, including 65 females (48.5%) and
70 males (51.4%), with a mean age 10.7±3.12 years,
followed in our Childhood Obesity Clinic. The mean
weight was 61.6±22.7 kg and the mean BMI was 29±4.9
kg/m². TSH ( U/mL), FT3 (pg/ mL), FT4 (ng/dL),
thyroid antithyroglobulin, and thyroid antiperoxidase
antibodies, were measured in every patient. The
existence of positive TD family history was recorded.
Subjects were stratified according to age-specific groups
(A: 2.5-10yrs, B: 10-17 yrs), and BMI-subgroups
(1: BMI<25, 2: 25 BMI<30, 3: BMI 30).
Results: TD was detected in 31 children (22.9%), with a
positive TD-family-history in 7 of these (22.5%). There
were 2 patients with decreased TSH, 18 with
eythyroidism and elevated TSH, 3 with elevated TSH
and positive thyroid autoantibodies or abnormal thyroid
hormones, 4 with elevated FT3, and 4 patients with
positive thyroid autoantibodies. In group A (52/135,
38.5%), 13/52 children (25%) had TD (subgroups A1:
23.8%, A2: 25%, A3: 28,5%). In group B (83/135,
61.4%), 18/83 children (21.4%) had TD (subgroups B1:
16.6%, B2: 16.2%, B3: 27.5%). There was no statistical
significant correlation of TD with the age-specific
groups or the BMI-subgroups of the obese children.
Conclusions: One out of four obese or overweight
children presents thyroid dysfunction, particularly
elevated TSH levels and/or positive thyroid
autoantibodies. A thyroid screening has to be included
in the diagnostic approach of the obese children.

Background and Aims: To evaluate the visual
abnormalities preceding the retinopathy in children with
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) with
contrast sensitivity testing (CS).
Methods: Sixty patients with IDDM (age range 8-18
years, mean 13.73±3.15 years) with a mean duration of
disease 5.9±3.8 years and a mean HbA1c of 8.26±1.93%
were studied. All patients had normal visual acuity
(> or = 1.0) and no visible diabetic retinopathy. Control
group consisted of 35 healthy subjects (age range 8-18
years; mean 12.1±3.11 years) with normal visual acuity.
Ophthalmoscopy and retinal photography were used to
determine the presence or absence of diabetic
retinopathy. CS was assessed with a CSV-1000 contrast
testing instrument, testing for four spatial frequencies, 3,
6, 12 and 18 cycles per degree (cpd). Patients’ CS
values were correlated to the variables age, duration of
disease and glycemic control (mean value of the last
four determinations of HbAlc).
Results: Contrast sensitivity function was significantly
impaired in patients with IDDM. The reduction was
statistically significant in all spatial frequencies
compared with the control group (p<0.05). Contrast
thresholds were inversely related to HbA1c levels in 3
and 6 cpd (linear regression r=-0.38, p<0.05 and
r=-0.33, p<0.05, respectively) but age and duration of
disease did not show any significant correlation.
Conclusions: Patients with IDDM demonstrate
abnormal contrast sensitivity. The results suggest that an
early dysfunction in visual pathway may occur without
visible retina involvement. CS testing can detect early
changes in the visual function of diabetic children.

Background and Aims: This study evaluated the
relationship between diet, anthropometry, blood lipids
and atherogenic risk in 70 healthy Spanish children
between 6-12 years.
Methods: Evaluation of the diet, anthropometry (body
mass index-BMI, skinfolds and perimeters) and PA
proofs were made. Spectrophotometry: total cholesterol
(TC), cholesterol joined to high (HDLc) and very low
(VLDLc) density lipoproteins, triglycerides (TG) in
mg/dL. Friedwald's formula: (LDLc). Atherogenic ratios
(ATI1)= LDLc/HDLc and (ATI2)= (VLDLc+LDLc) /
HDLc. Statistical analysis: Student/Welch 't' test,
Pearson and Spearman. *:p<0.05; **:p<0.01.
Results: 100% of the children had excess intake of total
fat (>80 g/day) and saturated fatty acids (>8g) and the
80% showed excess of cholesterol (>300 mg/day) in
their diet. The 57% had excess intake of kilocalories
(>2450 kcal/day) but deficiencies of calcium (90%),
iodine (76%) and phosporum (22%). Boys: Overweight:
26.2%, obesity: 7.1%. Girls: Overweight: 25%, obesity:
10.7%. Correlations established: BMI and TG, VLDLc,
ATI1 y ATI2 (r=0.389**; r=0.290**; r=0.434**,
r=0.553**), respectively; BMI and HDLc (r=-0.366**).
The relation of the BMI to measured skinfolds (biceps,
triceps, subescapular and abdominal) were: r=0.860**,
r=0.859**, r=0.826** and r=0.788**. 11.1% of children
had TC> P95 (200 mg/dl), 14.8% of them had TG>P95
(110 mg/dl) and 3.7% had LDLc>P95 (150 mg/dl). 30%
of the children didn´t practise PA and 27% PA
frequently.
Conclusions: A high % of the children studied showed
overweight and obesity, high BMI, plasma TG, VLDLc,
elevated AT and low HDLc. These factors could be
influenced by the diet and the PA and could predispose
to future cardiovascular diseases in the adulthood.

Background and Aims: In Italy about 8% of newborns
are born to foreign mothers. Despite growing concerns
about ethnic inequalities in pregnancy outcome, little is
known about the health of these infants when born
severely preterm. This study compares neonatal
outcomes of Foreign Mothers’ (FMs) and Italian
Mothers’ (IMs) very preterm babies in a large area-
based national cohort.
Methods: The study population consisted of 2897
infants, gestational age 22-31 wks, born in six Italian
regions during 2003-2004 and admitted to NICUs.
Socio-demographic maternal information, including
citizenship, and perinatal data were collected as part of
the Italian project on Very Preterm Pregnancies and
Births (ACTION). The main outcomes were in-hospital
mortality and a combination of mortality and severe
morbidity (intraventricular hemorrhage intraventricular
of grade III-IV, periventricular leukomalacia and
bronchopulmonary dysplasia) at discharge. The Cox
proportional hazards and logistic regression analysis
were used to model the two outcomes.
Results: 628 infants (22% of total) were born to FMs.
Compared to IMs’ infants, they were more often
severely preterm (38.1% vs 28.7% in 22-27 wks
category); less often from multiple pregnancy (22.8% vs
29.1%); experienced a lower use of prenatal steroids
(71.4% vs 80.5%), and higher in-hospital mortality
(20.2% vs 16.6%) and combined mortality/morbidity
(34.2% vs 31%). However, when potential confounders
were adjusted for, FMs’ babies had no greater risk of
mortality (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.74-1.15) or
mortality/morbidity (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.68-1.13).
Conclusions: When relevant risk factors are taken into
account, neonatal outcomes of FMs’ very preterm
infants were comparable to those of IMs.

Background and Aims: Pre eclampsia along with its
complications continues to be one of the major causes of
maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. In spite of so
many researches, the pathology of pre eclampsia has not
yet been fully elucidated. The purpose of the study was
to determine whether maternal serum levels of androgen
and progesterone, are higher in patient with pre
eclampsia than in matched control subjects.
Methods: Serum progesterone, total testosterone, free
testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone levels were
measured in 19 subjects in third trimester of pregnancy
with documented pre eclampsia and 17 healthy
normotensive women with similar maternal and
gestational age. All subjects were primigravida women
with singleton pregnancy who were visited in Kosar
Medical center in Uromiyeh.
- 222 -
Results: There were no significant difference between
two groups in maternal age, gestational age and body
mass index. Progesterone and free testosterone levels
were significantly lower (P=0.01) in patients with pre
eclampsia (75.1.±8.6 ng/dl and 2.27±1.74 pg/dl,
respectively) than in control group (111.6±9.71ng/dl and
3.73±1.31 pg/dl, respectively). There were no
significant difference in total testosterone and
dehydroepiandrosterone levels between cases
(1.02±0.10 ng/dl and 0.99±0.13 μg/dl respectively) and
controls (1.37±.019 ng/dl and 0.98±5.15 μg/dl
respectively.
Conclusions: Accentuated sex hormone binding
globulin increase in pre eclampsia is the cause of
significant decreased free testosterone of pre eclamptic
cases. Levels of progesterone were pathologically and
significantly lower in pre eclamptic cases than control
women with similar age, gestational age and body mass
index. Keyword: Pre eclampsia, androgen, progesterone,

GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY IN SHORT
STATURED CHILDREN
S Abtahi, M R Khazaee
Department of Pediatrics, Mashhad Azad University,
22 Bahman Hospital, Mashhad, Khorasan, Iran
Background and Aims: One of the causes of growth
failure is Growth Hormone Deficiency, that usually
shows a growth pattern of less than 2 inches a year.
Sometimes there is a deficiency of other pituitary
hormones resulting in Hypopituitarism.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey. A total of 293
children were referred for growth hormone evaluation.
All the patients underwent thorough clinical evaluation
including recording of height, weight, presence of
chronic diseases and malnutrition. Twenty children were
excluded for various reasons. Screening for GH
deficiency was carried out by exercise stimulation test
and/or L-dopa stimulation test. The children with GH
level < 10 mIU/L on screening tests were provisionally
considered to have GH deficiency. These children
underwent insulin tolerance test (ITT).
Results: Out of 273 children, 189 were subjected to
both exercise and L-dopa stimulation test, while 60
patients underwent only exercise stimulation test. The
remaining 24 patients were subjected to L-dopa
administration alone because of their physical weakness
or inability to perform exercise. Sixty-six patients
exhibited GH levels < 10 mIU/L on screening tests. The
frequency of GH deficiency was found to be 24.17% on
screening. Out of these 66 patients, 54 underwent an
ITT, while 12 patients did not report back for the test.
Thirty-eight children showed lack of response on ITT,
therefore, after ITT, the frequency of GH deficiency was
revealed to be 13.9%.
Conclusions: GH deficiency is responsible for about
14% cases of short stature in a hospital setting.
Screening tests showed a positive predictive value of
70.4% and a false positivity of 6.8%.

Royal Infirmary, Leicester, UK
Background and Aims: Extrauterine growth
retardation is a major clinical problem in very low birth
infants (VLBW). Parenteral Nutrition (PN) serves to
achieve rapid maximal nutrition in early postnatal life.
Since there is no consensus with regard to optimal
neonatal PN practice, we aimed to ascertain current
practice regarding prescribed PN glucose, protein and
lipid intake in early postnatal period in the VLBW in the
United Kingdom.
Methods: Survey questionnaire was emailed to hospital
neonatal pharmacists serving level 3 and major level 2
units in the UK. Survey data items were static numerical
information regarding PN prescription until
establishment of full PN. Data are expressed as median
and range.
Results: A response was obtained from 46 (71.8%)
units (70% of level 3 and 75% of level 2). 25 out of 46
centres (54%) initiated PN on day 1. Full PN was
achieved by day 5 (range 4-10). Comparison of
prescribed PN with RDA demonstrated a deficit of
477.9 kcal/kg and 1.65gm/kg nitrogen protein in the first
10 days of life (see table).
Conclusions: There is diverse practice with regard to
neonatal PN prescription in the UK. In view of
difficulties in establishment of enteral feeding in
VLBW, current PN practice would entail a significant
calorie and protein deficit during early postnatal life and
warrants a review.

Background and Aims: To evaluate GH-IGF-I axis
before and after paediatric cardiac surgery and to
determine influencing factors.
Methods: Observational study with 49 children
undergoing cardiac surgery divided according to age
into: infants (n=19), young children (n=20) and
teenagers (n=10). Measurements were: GH profiles after
surgery and IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-1 levels before,
at end of surgery, 12 and 24 hours thereafter.
Results: At start of surgery, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 SD-
scores were lower than reference values and related to
low weight SD-scores and cyanosis. At end of surgery,
mean-GH levels were elevated and related inversely to
high-dose glucocorticoid and dopamine administration,
but not to IL-6 levels. Glucose levels were higher in
patients who received glucocorticoids than in those who
did not. At end of surgery, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 SD-
scores related to the percentage plasma administered
during surgery, and not to IL-6 or GH levels. At start of
surgery, IGFBP-1 related to insulin levels, but at end of
surgery to IL-6 levels. Twenty-four hours after cardiac
surgery, IGF-I, IGFBP-3 SD-scores and IGFBP-1 levels
returned to the initial values at start of surgery.
Conclusions: At start of surgery low IGF-I related to
underweight and low IGFBP-3 to cyanosis.
Glucocorticoids and dopamine had significant influence
on GH and percentage plasma on IGF-I and IGFBP-3
levels, whereas IL-6 levels had no significant influence.
Glucocorticoid administration during surgery was
associated with higher glucose levels. Already the day
after surgery, IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-1 levels had
returned to the initial values at start of surgery.

School of Medical Sciences, Tehran University of
Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran
Background and Aims: Malnutrition is common in
developing and under developing countries and Urinary
tract infection (UTI) is a well-recognized complication
in malnourished children.
Methods: We examined the incidence of UTI,
bacteriuria and pyuria in malnourished children. Of 61
patients (19 boys), 1 had severe, 15 had moderate and
45 had mild malnutrition. A normally nourished control
matched for age, sex and presence of fever was
included. Clean catch midstream urine specimens from
patients and control group were examined
microscopically and cultured.
Results: The incidence of UTI, bacteriuria and pyuria in
malnourished subjects was 44%, 44% and 13%
respectively. The incidence of UTI, bacteriuria and
pyuria in control children was 19%, 19% and 11%
respectively. E. coli is predominantly an organism
isolated in patient and control group.
Conclusions: Our observations show that malnourished
children are at risk for UTI. Urinalysis and urine culture
is useful for screening for UTI in these subjects.

Background and Aims: The incidence of type I
diabetes mellitus (T1DM) has recently increased in
some countries. The purpose of this study is to ascertain
the incidence of T1DM in our population during
1990-2004, and detect any increasing trend.
Methods: All cases of newly diagnosed T1DM children
under the age of 15 years were registered and relevant
information was obtained. The population demographic
data were provided by the Ministry of Finance and
statistical analysis was processed with SPSS.
Results: The mean overall annual incidence of T1DM
during this 15-year period was: 11.95 /100000 with a
statistically significant increase in the last five years.
The incidence during the 5-year periods was as follow:
(90-94): 10.50/100000, (95-99): 10.80/100000 (p: 0.55)
and (00-04): 14.80/100000 (p: 0.0014). The overall
female: male ratio was 1.06:1. There is a gender
influence on the age of onset as more males manifest
T1DM before age 6 yr and after 13 yr. There was a
significant variation in the number of newly diagnosed
patients during spring compared to autumn (p=0.023)
and winter (p=0.002). There is also a statistically
significant difference in cases diagnosed in summer
compared to winter (p=0.012). Seasonal variation was
marginal for patients diagnosed in the preschool age
(0-4.99 years) and interestingly abolished in cases
diagnosed during the period of high incidence
2000-2004.
Conclusions: The overall incidence of T1DM in Cyprus
has increased during the last 5 years. The gender
differences in the age of onset could be explained by the
combination of genetic loading and pubertal hormonal
changes.

Pediatric Clinic, Venizeleio General Hospital, Iraklio,
Crete, Greece
Background and Aims: Mediterranean diet (a greater
intake of olive oil, cereals, legumes, fruits and
vegetables) and physical activity seem to have been
- 224 -
modified. We examined trends in diet, activity and the
prevalence of obesity among a population of preschool
children in our city.
Methods: Questionnaires about dietary habits, outdoor
physical activity and time spent on TV, were completed
by the parents of 380 children aged 3-6 years. 100 of the
children were weighted and measured for height and
their BMI was calculated.
Results: 43 (11%) out of 380 children never take
breakfast. 41 (11%) consume junk food every day and
19 (5%) never consume junk food. Only 145 (38%)
children consume fruit and vegetables daily and 7 (2%)
never eat fruit and vegetables. 90% of the children share
at least one meal with their whole family, but the rest
10% share none. 258 (68%) watch TV every day and
34% spend 2-3 hours daily on TV. 140 (37%) rarely
play outside and only 20 (5%) play more than 3 hours
per day in parks or playgrounds. BMI was estimated for
100 children, 52 were boys. 33% of those were
overweight (BMI 75th - 95th percentile) and 12% were
obese (BMI> 95th percentile).
Conclusions: The diet of our children, and their
physical activity have been influenced by the western
lifestyle. Those changes result in high prevalence of
obesity in preschool children. This should lead
prevention strategies to focus on promoting
Mediterranean lifestyle which has been proven healthier.

Department of Pediatrics, General Hospital of Nikea,
Piraeus, Greece
Background and Aims: Adequate Ca uptake in
childhood is essential in preventing osteoporotic
changes later in adulthood. The aim of our study was the
determination of the amount of daily calcium intake of
school aged children of our country.
Methods: We diligently investigated the possible Ca
sources contained in the diet of 712 children (368 boys-
344 girls) 6-12 years old living in an urban district by
filling in a special questionnaire after interviewing their
parents.
Results: The daily Ca (mg) intake per age and sex
appears on the table. 95.8% of children 6 yrs old have
adequate calcium intake (above the recommended for
age, >450mg/24h), along with 81.8% of children 7-10
yrs old (>550mg/24h). On the contrary, only 31,6% of
children 11-12 yrs old have adequate daily calcium
intake (>800mg/24h).
Conclusions: Daily calcium intake is satisfactory up to
the age of 10. However, it decreases significantly
thereafter, making the threat of osteoporosis more likely
in future.
HEPATOSPLENIC AND MULTIFOCAL BONE

Background and Aims: We describe a child with
prolonged fever of unknown origin and prominent
skeletal pain who had hepatic and splenic abscesses and
multifocal bone disease caused by Bartonella infection.
Methods: Radiologic studies, including plain films,
radionuclide scintigraphy and computed tomography,
yielded positive results.
Results: Microbiologic diagnoses were established
serologically.
Conclusions: Several atypical presentations of cat-
scratch disease (CSD) have been recognized, including
encephalopathy, Parinaud’s oculoglandular disease,
hepatic and splenic abscesses, osteomyelitis with lytic
bone lesions, neuroretinitis and prolonged fever without
source.

Department of Pediatric Intensive Care, Hospital de
Dona Estefânia, Lisbon, Portugal
Background and Aims: Hemorrhagic shock and
encephalopathy syndrome is a severe disease of
unknown aetiology with significant mortality and
neurological morbidity. It affects previously healthy
infants of less than 1 year of age.
Methods: Clinical case.
Results: We describe a previously healthy five-month-
old infant found unresponsive and with gasping
respirations by his mother. He was taken to the
emergency department of the regional hospital where he
developed seizure activity. Physical examination
revealed auricular temperature of 41ºC, gasping
breathing pattern, hypotension and poor perfusion. Later
then, he started to bleed from puncture sites. He initiated
antiepileptic drugs, cardiovascular and respiratory
support measures and was transferred to our facility.
The seizure activity was refractory to benzodiazepines,
phenytoin and responded to fenobarbital. Laboratory
data revealed severe metabolic acidosis, abnormal renal
functions, hypoglicemia, consumption coagulopathy and
increased transaminase and CPK levels. Computed
tomography of the head revealed no mass, hemorrhage
or midline shift. Cerebrospinal fluid analyses were
normal. Blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid cultures
were negative. Ammonia levels were normal. Serologic
test for hantaviruses and arboviruses were negative. He
required continuous midazolan infusions, phenytoin and
fenobarbital for seizure control, vasopressor and blood
transfusions for cardiovascular support and mechanical
ventilation. Despite aggressive management, his
neurological condition deteriorated with signs of raised
- 225 -
intracranial pressure and died on the 7th day of
admission.
Conclusions: Although rare, hemorrhagic shock and
encephalopathy syndrome should be considered in the
differential diagnosis of shock, convulsions and coma,
coagulopathy, fever, metabolic acidosis and hepatorenal
dysfunction.

Background and Aims: In Poland acute poisoning in
children is estimated of approximately 80000 cases a
year. 1,5% of them require PICU admittance, 120 of
them die. One of the most serious clinical courses
leading to multi organ failure is observed in acute
chromium-copper intoxication. The aim of the study
was to analyse the outcome of such cases.
Methods: Three children admitted to our PICU during
the last 5 years with signs of multi organ failure
following accidental digestion of wood preservative
products. Two girls (age 4 and 11 years) and one boy
(age 5) referred to the PICU in 47, 80 and 94 hours after
intoxication.
Results: On admission cardiovascular, renal and liver
failure as well as ARDS and brain oedema had been
diagnosed. The oldest girl required CPR immediately
and died 1 hour later. Two other patients were electively
intubated and ventilated using PRVC mode. Both of
them were qualified for urgent combined liver-kidney
transplantation. As a bridge before transplantation the
extracorporeal MARS procedure was started. In each
case two MARS sessions were performed. Despite of
intensive treatment both children died in 137 and 51
hours after admission (184 and 145 hours after
intoxication). At the meantime no required organ for the
transplantation was available. Post mortem analysis
confirmed lethal chromium and copper concentration in
blood and tissues.
Conclusions: Despite of significant progress in multi
organ failure the outcome of chromium-copper acute
intoxication still remains fatal.

Background and Aims: To find the incidence of the
Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) in our unit, the time of
occurrence and the risk factors in order to establish a
strategy for prevention.
Methods: The population studied was represented by
the Very Low Birth Weight Infants (VLBW) born
between January 2004-January 2006. The diagnosis of
PDA was established both clinically and by ultrasound.
The treatment options were represented by fluid
restriction only or fluid restriction + indomethacin i.v.
Results: In the study period, there were born 112
VLBW infants. The incidence of PDA was 29.5% (31
cases). There were 2 period at risk for the occurrence of
PDA – days of life 2-3 (12 cases) and 14 (7 cases). The
risk factors identified were represented by the excess of
fluids administered to the PDA group in the first 2 days
of life (p< 0.004) and fluids over 140 ml/kg in days
13-14 (p<0.0056). From the 31 cases, the date rate was
5/16 in the early group (days 2-3) and 2/15 in the rest of
the babies. The fluid restriction was efficient in closing
the PDA in 20/31 cases and Indomethacin (1 course of 3
doses) closed the PDA in another 4 cases.
Conclusions: PDA appears in the case of excess fluid
administration in a VLBW neonate. The periods of
maximum risk are days 2-3 of life and day 14 of life.
Fluid restriction resulted in closure of 2/3 of the PDA.

Background and Aims: Mortality is an easily
measurable outcome following PICU. We were
interested in identifying other less easily measurable
adverse outcomes including physical and psychological
morbidity in patients and their carers. In January 2002
we established a PICU follow-up clinic to identify these
outcomes and offer appropriate support.
Methods: Patients admitted to a tertiary PICU
(oncology, hepatology, renal and general paediatric)
ventilated for >24 hours, and alive at three months post
discharge were offered clinic appointments. We carried
out a retrospective review of clinic records of 54
consecutive patients invited to clinic during 2002-3.
Results: Of 54 patients, 31 (56.4%) attended, 22
(40.7%) failed to attend and 1 patient died before
attendance. Patients were more likely to attend if they
lived locally (54.8% attenders v 46.5% nonattenders), or
were admitted from the general paediatric population
with respiratory or infectious diseases (65.38%).
Reasons for non attendance included continued
hospitalisation and ongoing outpatient treatment under a
tertiary specialist. In 18 (58%) of attenders there were
no problems. Morbidity was identified in 10 (32%) of
patients. Soft tissue injury including pressure sores (4),
nail bed injury (1) extravasation injury (1) were
- 226 -
commonest. 1 patient suffered an arterial injury
requiring revascularisation. 4 patients complained of
severe emergence phenomenon. 1 patient, 1 sibling and
4 parents were identified as suffering Post-traumatic
stress disorder.
Conclusions: PICU follow-up clinics can provide useful
information regarding physical and psychological
morbidity in patients and carers. Patients are more likely
to attend if they live locally and are not requiring long
term specialist follow up.

Background and Aims: Pectus excavatum a chest wall
deformity seen in children is determined by the excess
growth of the chondrocostal cartilage. A new
nonsurgical alternative approach for treatment of this
malformation could consist in control of the cartilage
growth.
Methods: The local and systemic effects of human
growth hormone, injected at the surface of intact
chondrocostal cartilage in Sprague Dawley rats were
studied. Two weeks old rats (n=16) were divided into an
experimental E and a control C group. The chondro-
costal cartilages of the right hemi thorax were injected
every two days for 21 days. Body weight and blood
concentration of the growth hormone, was measured one
hour after the injection. Chondro-costal cartilage was
harvested for histological analysis.
Results: Blood analysis one hour after local injection,
showed a significant increase in growth hormone levels
in the experimental group compared with the control (C)
group ; E group; 61.14 ± 35.87 U.I. / ml vs. C group;
0.15 ± 2.56 U.I. /ml, p 0.003 The growth hormone
injected, did not influence the body weight of the rats in
the experimental group when compared with the control
group E ; 26.12 ± 25.52 gr. vs. C 22.87 ± 34.98 gr.,
p 0.7953 Histological analysis confirmed the presence
of ossification and calus formation at the site of
injection and modified shape of the cartilage was noted
at gross inspection.
Conclusions: These results encourage us to further
investigate the possibility of a locally applied therapy in
case of pectus excavatum.
OUTCOMES OF PATIENTS REQUIRING
PAEDIATRIC RESPIRATORY ECMO SUPPORT

Department of Cardiac Critical Care, Great Ormond
Street Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: Paediatric respiratory is one of
the most diverse groups of patients supported with
ECMO, with a total of 3,064 paediatric respiratory cases
on the ELSO registry, and an overall survival to
discharge of 56%. There is little published descriptive
data on this group. Our aims were to analyse the
background and clinical course of children requiring
respiratory ECMO support, in particular to assess the
effects of pre-existing co-morbidity on ECMO need and
outcome, and the changes in respiratory ECMO support
over the last 12 years in our institution.
Methods: Retrospective review of paediatric respiratory
ECMO cases at Great Ormond Street Hospital between
July 1992 – December 2005, with no cardiac lesions or
primary cardiac reason for ECMO support.
Results: 123 cases were supported over the study
period. The overall survival to hospital discharge was
61.8%. Median duration of ECMO support was 9 days.
A high proportion (50.4%) of children had pre-existing
co-morbidities. Of patients who survived discharge from
hospital, there was a late survival of 59.3%, with post
discharge deaths ranging from 14 days to 4.4 years after
ECMO support. Amongst patients with comorbidities,
there was significantly lower survival in those with
chromosomal defects, sickle cell disease, tracheal
patients, and patients with haematological or
oncological diagnoses.
Conclusions: A high proportion had a pre-existing
medical condition that put them at increased risk of
critical illness. Co-morbidity was also associated with a
high proportion of late mortality. Survival, as expected,
depends on underlying condition and reason for ECMO,
ranging from 31-100%.

Background and Aims: In our study we monitored
children from YUSAD study group that begun 8 years
ago. Aim of our study was to determine the movement
of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in children
and Body Mass Index (BMI) during 5 year period.
Methods: Clinical examination was performed and
blood pressure (BP) was measured. Results were
compared with nomograms for age and gender.
Results: Systolic BP was analyzed in 4243 children.
Diastolic BP was analyzed in 3048 children. During 5
years of follow-up period in 3.55% of children systolic
BP worsened and in 2.92% of children systolic BP
improved. In 1.93% of children diastolic BP worsened
- 227 -
and in 0.78% of children diastolic BP improved. In 3525
children age of 10 years (49.82% girls and 50.18%
boys) and in 3439 children age of 15 years (49.98% girls
and 50.02% boys), BMI was (median value ± standard
deviation): Girls: BMI 16,96±2,91 and 20,54±3,41.
Boys: BMI 17,16±2,82 and 17,18±2,98.
Conclusions: During 5 year period increase and
decrease in values of systolic BP were frequent than
same changements of diastolic BP. During same period
elevation of BMI in girls compared to boys was
detected.

Macedonia
Background and Aims: Cardio-vascular diseases have
become a leading in the world. Arterioscleriscleroses
starts during childhood, but clinical occurrence is later
in life. Aim of this work is to show risk factors for
occurrence of arteriosclerosis and cardio-vascular
diseases at children.
Methods: Interview screening of 250 children (age of
13 and 14) of their weight, frequency of sport or fitness
activity, time spent watching television, nutritious habits
and smocking in the family.
Results: From total number of screened, 130 were girls,
120 boys. Obesity was found with 7% of girls and 13%
of boys.
Conclusions: An average child at the age of 13 ate junk
food, watch TV for 3-5 hours a day, doesn't do sports
(or unsatisfactory), and is passive smoker. So, still in the
school age all factors of risk for arterioscleroses are
present. There is need of huge action for promoting
healthy lifestyle and eliminating bad habits. This will
not only prevent cardio-vascular diseases, but it will also
bring more quality and balance in life.

Background and Aims: The aim of this study was to
audit the management of post cardiac surgical
chylothorax in children presenting in Tertiary
Cardiology Center and compare the practice against the
local guidelines.
Methods: Records of children presenting to Alder Hey
Children's hospital Cardiology ward for Open Heart
Cardiac surgeries during Jan 2000 - Dec 2004 were
randomly analysed using a structured chylothorax
pathway proforma covering assessment and
management. Retrospective, Single Institute, Random
case note analysis.
Results: 72 children developed chylothorax as post
operative complication and records of 35 were randomly
selected and analysed.11/35 (31.4%) were neonates and
12/35 (34.2%) were between 1-12 months age group.
Fallot's repair (14%) and Cavo- pulmonary shunt
(11.4%) were a common cause for chylothorax. 21
(60%) were tested for chyle due to the macroscopic
appearance of pleural fluid and 7 (20%) for effusions
persisting for more than 48hours. 26 (74%) were
managed on Monogen feeds alone, 4 (11.4%) with
Octreotide, 1 with TPN and 3 (8.5%) did not require any
treatment. The median number of days chest drains were
in-situ in all the cases was 12 (Range 4-27 days) and the
length of stay in hospital with uncomplicated
chylothorax was 21 days (Range 6-49). The morbidity
associated with chylothorax resulting in prolonged
length of stay in hospital was 21 days (Range 6-49) and
prolonged chest drain in-situ was 12 days (Range 4 -
27). In Monogen resistant cases, Octreotide remains an
effective alternative for treatment as observed in 4
(11.4%) cases.
Conclusion: Monogen feeds remain the first line
management of post cardiac surgical chylothorax.

Background and Aims: Primary persistent
hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycemia of infancy is a rare
disorder which is currently difficult to treat. Diazoxide
treatment remains the mainstay of medical therapy.
Tolerance of diazoxide is usually excellent, but several
side effects of this drug have been described.
Methods: We present 4 month old girl who developed
pulmonary hypertension, heart failure and neutropenia
during diazoxide therapy. The patient was 3 months old
infant, affected by persistent and severe hypoglycemia.
Hyperinsulinism diagnosed and she was treated with
octreotide (10 /kg/day). Then diazoxide (15mg/kg/day)
was added, because of inadequate control of blood
glucose. After ten days later, she became dyspneic.
- 228 -
Echocardiography revealed moderate pulmonary
hypertension, RA/LA enlargement and LV enlargement.
Although she administered iloprost, her clinical
condition worsened and referred to our pediatric
intensive care unit.
Results: On admission to pediatric intensive care unit,
she had tachycardia, dyspnea, cyanosis, low oxygen
saturation and CVP 15 cmH2O. She was intubated and
required mechanical ventilation and her white blood cell
count: 3900 mm3. Because of side-effects, diazoxide
was stopped on the 13th day. During the next three days
his respiratory and hemodynamic status dramatically
improved and she was weaned from mechanical
ventilation. Control white blood cell count was 8800
mm3 and control echocardiography showed reduction of
PAP to 20 mmHg and resolution of atrial and ventricular
enlargement.
Conclusions: Pediatric physicians should be in mind of
pulmonary hypertension, heart failure and neutropenia
developing during diazoxide therapy.

Background and Aims: The purpose of this report is to
evaluate the results of the screening program for
Congenital Hypothyroidism (CH) in the Greek Cypriot
population, which was introduced in 1990.
Methods: During 1990 - 2003, 127530 neonates were
screened with TSH determination. Permanent CH was
proven after discontinuation of treatment at age 3 years.
SPSS was used for statistical analysis
Results: Permanent CH was diagnosed on 70 infants -
incidence 1/ 1820, with a female/male ratio 2.05 /1. The
most common clinical findings were: Omphalocele
(61%) and large anterior fontanelle (49%). The more
delayed the bone maturation, the lower were initial T4
levels (p=0.005). Bone maturation was more delayed in
thyroid agenesis (p=0.049). Scintigraphy of the thyroid
with TC 99 revealed: Ectopia in 38%, thyroid agenesis
in 36%, thyroid hypoplasia 24% and dyshormono-
genesis in 1.7%. Children with transient CH had initially
lower T4 and higher TSH values, although initial TSH
levels failed to predict the nature of CH. Children with
transient CH required less thyroxine dosage to maintain
normal thyroid hormone levels. The TSH level was
normalized before the age of 2 months with a starting
L-thyroxine dose of 10mcg/kg/daily. The developmental
outcome of the children is within the normal range.
Conclusions: The incidence of CH in Greek Cypriots is
1/1820 live births. The most common etiology is thyroid
dysgenesis. Initial T4 levels correlated with the degree
of skeletal maturation, and the etiology. Initial TSH
level, although lower in children with transient CH,
could not predict the nature of CH.

Klinikum, Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany
Background and Aims: Programmed proliferative
degeneration of the human fetal ductus arteriosus (DA)
in preparation for its definite postnatal closure has a
large developmental variability and is controlled by
several signalling pathways. VEGF plays an important
role in the formation of the neointima and vasa vasorum
ingrowth during permanent closure of the DA.
Methods: We examined ductal protein expression of
VEGF, VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 in 51 human fetal
autopsy DA specimens between 11-38 weeks of
gestation which were collected over 12 months at the
Charité Department of Paidopathology. According to
their histological maturity specimens were classified
using a new maturity score. Immunohistochemistry was
performed on paraformaldehyde-fixed specimens
following a standard protocol. Immunohistochemical
staining was evaluated semiquantitatively by three
independent observers using a discrete scale with 0.5
intervals varying from '0' for no staining to '3' for strong
staining.
Results: VEGF, VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2- staining was
detected in all three maturity stages. VEGF-staining was
localized perinuclearly in all three vascular regions and
did not alter during development. VEGF-R1 expression
was profound in the endothelium in early maturity
stages and decreased during development. In contrast
VEGF-R2 predominated in later developmental stages
in the muscular layer.
Conclusions: Our results emphasize the importance of
VEGF as a mediator during proliferative degeneration of
the fetal ductus and support the hypothesis that VEGF-
R1 is required for normal blood vessel development
during embryogenesis while VEGF-R2 is the
predominant receptor in later angiogenic signalling.

Background and Aims: To investigate the relation of
serum leptin levels with nutritional status and with
hemodynamic and echocardiographic parameters in
patients with left-to-right shunt.
Methods: From January till December 2004, 40 patients
with left-to-right shunt aged 3 months to 2 years old
were included in the study. Cardiac diagnoses included
20 ventricular septal defect (VSD), 5 atrial septal defect
(ASD), 6 patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and 9 patients
with a combination of VSD, ASD or PDA. The patients
above 80% of their ideal weight for height were group 1
and those below 80% were group 2. Echocardiographic
parameters included left ventricular mass index
(LVM/h2.7) and relative wall thickness. Pulmonary
artery pressure and ratio of pulmonary to systemic flow
(Qp/Qs) were determined during cardiac catheterization.
The serum leptin, glucose and insulin levels were
measured after 8 hours of fasting.
Results: Serum leptin levels were lower in patients with
body weight less than 80% of ideal weight for height
than those above 80% (2.27±1.20 vs 2.58±0.92 ng/mL,
p=0.041) and in patients with pulmonary hypertension
(PH) than those without (2.15±1.28 vs 2.67±0.80,
p=0.011). The LVM index was greater in patients with
PH. Serum leptin levels showed a negative correlation
with pulmonary artery pressure, Qp/Qs, and LVM
index.
Conclusions: Patients with left-to right shunt lesions
having PH and high pulmonary to systemic flow ratio
have lower weight and height. Their serum leptin levels
are also lower which may be related to their cardiac
hypertrophy.

Hospital for Sick Children, Belfast, UK
Background and Aims: For parents of children with
complex congenital heart disease, the immediate period
following discharge from hospital is an anxious time.
Many families feel isolated and need access to
professional help at times other than their regular
review. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of
videoconferencing to support families at home and its
effect on parental anxiety and use of NHS services.
Methods: Randomised controlled clinical trial
comparing a videoconferencing protocol with regular
telephone contacts or “usual” out patient follow up
currently provided. Inclusion criteria: 1. Severe
congenital heart defect and 2. Significant support
anticipated after discharge. Qualitative and quantitative
data (including O2 saturations & STAI questionnaires)
collected to assess impact of videoconferencing service
on families’ quality of life and use of NHS services.
Results: 50 families: Videoconference support n=21,
Telephone support n=16, “Usual follow up” n=13. Age
range: 1 month – 3 years. No. videoconferences: Range
6-15, Mean 8. 100% parents felt the videoconferences
beneficial and reassuring. 72% of videoconference
advice would have been different if telephone only
available, 58% telephone advice may have been
different if videoconferencing available. Preliminary
results suggest videoconferencing provides significant
benefits over telephone follow-up in providing
reassurance and support. No situations of clinical risk or
near misses. Initially, start up and running costs were
high but these are now significantly reduced.
Conclusions: Initial results suggest that
videoconferencing provides significant benefits over
telephone follow-up in providing reassurance and
support to families of children with severe congenital
heart disease. There are obvious applications for this
study in other medical specialities.

Background and Aims: Septic shock (SS) is a life-
threatening disease, characterized by impaired
myocardial contractility and loss of vascular tone, often
requiring treatment with vasocontrictive agents (VA).
Data on the long term effects of SS and VA on the
developing myocardium in SS-survivors are lacking. We
hypothesize that the combination of the underlying
illness and the side-effects of its treatment will result in
permanent damage of the developing heart in children.
Methods: SS survivors admitted to our tertiary PICU
between 1995 and 2004 who had received 24 hours
administration of VA's were included. Cardiac function
was evaluated by ECG in rest and during exercise (when
> 7 years), 24-hours-ECG-registration and echo-
cardiography. Age at admission and follow-up, severity
of illness (PIM II score), length of PICU stay were
evaluated.
Results: Ninety of 124 eligible patients were evaluated.
In 14 patients abnormalities were detected; such as
episodes of ventricular extrasystole during and after
exercise (n= 3), rhythm disturbances on 24-hours-ECG
registration (n=2), mild left ventricular hypertrophy
(n=1) and mild systolic dysfunction of the right ventricle
(n=8) on echocardiography. Patient characteristics were
not statistically different between patients with and
without abnormalities.
Conclusions: A 15% prevalence of ventricular
dysrhythmia and/or mild dysfunction of the right
ventricle is seen in 90 SS survivors, 1-10 yrs after
admission. Since ventricular rhythm disturbances could
lead to sudden cardiac death and the meaning of this
dysfunction of the right ventricle in developing children
is not known, long term follow-up of survivors of SS in
childhood is essential.

Background and Aims: Chronic Granulomatous
Disease (CGD), an inherited disorder of phagocytic
cells, results from inability of phagocytes to undergo the
respiratory burst to kill certain types of bacteria and
fungi leading to life-threatening infections. Our aim was
reviewing clinical, analytical and epidemiological
features in patients diagnosed of CGD in our hospital.
Methods: clinical charts of 12 patients diagnosed during
childhood in our centre between 1980 to 2005 were
retrospectively reviewed.
Results: All males. Median age at diagnose: 36.5
months. Onset symptoms: lymphadenitis and cervical
abscesses 3/12 (Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia
liquefaciens y Klebsiella sp.), pneumonia 3/12,
(Rhodococcus equi, Salmonella typhimurium and
Pneumocistis jiroveci), osteomyelitis 1/12 (Aspergilus
sp.), septicaemia 1/12 (Staphylococcus aureus), urinary
tract infections 1/12 (Klebsiella sp.), aphtous ulcers of
the mouth 1/12 and Crohn like colitis 1/12. Initial
diagnostic by Nitroblue Tetrazolium Test (NBT) and
confirmed by oxidation flux citometry test 9/12 and
genetics (gp91phox) 8/12. Patients presented 83
infections: abscesses (26), pneumonia (10),
lymphadenitis (9), enteric infections (7), septicaemia
(4), osteomyelitis (3) and others (24). Responsible
microorganisms (38): Aspergillus sp. (10),
Staphylococcus sp. (5), Salmonella sp (4), Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (4), and others (15). Patients were treated
with interferon-gamma (5/12) and received prophylactic
itraconazole (9/12) and/or cotrimoxazole (11/12). Four
patients died: 2 septicaemia (invasive aspergillosis,
unidentified negative gram bacillary infection), 1
disseminated leishmaniasis, 1 kidney transplant
complications.
Conclusions: clinical suspicion and flow citometry are
basic in diagnosing CGD patients and related familiars.
Specific prophylaxis and medical care should be
promptly established to prevent severe infections.
Interferon-gamma has been intermittently used although
its use remains controversial.

Background and Aims: The decision to treat children
with cancer on a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) is
difficult because they suffer from an acute life
threatening illness superimposed on a chronic life
threatening disease. Recent data show improvement in
outcome for critically ill cancer patients requiring PICU
support. However, commonly used risk scores fail to
predict acute mortality in these patients. To assess acute
outcome of pediatric hemato-oncology patients admitted
to the PICU for reasons other than routine postoperative
care and to validate a new risk score.
Methods: Retrospective analysis.
Results: 90 PICU admissions (2000-2005) of 67
children with hemato-oncological disease. 18 children
died on the PICU (mortality rate 20%). 28 admissions
(31%) occurred during or after Hematopoietic Stem Cell
Transplantation (HSCT) with higher mortality rate
(36%). In the HSCT group, 4 patients died from disease
progression and 6 from transplant related complications.
In the non HSCT group 6 children died from disease
progression. For 56 admissions sufficient data were
available to calculate Pediatric Risk of Mortality
(PRISM) score and a novel risk score described by
Meyer et al. Median PRISM score was higher in non
survivors (9, range 0-18) as compared to survivors (4,
range 0-20) with significant overlap. Novel risk scores
varied from 0 to 4 in non survivors (median 1) and from
0 to 5 in survivors (median 1).
Conclusions: Good short term survival (80%). Worse
outcome when admission after HSCT (64%). Disease
progression and HSCT related complications mean
causes of death. Novel risk score failed to distinguish
survivors from non survivors.

Background and Aims: Cystatin, a proteinase
inhibitor, is involved in the intracellular catabolism of
proteins. We aimed to investigate the changes and
clinical value of the serum Cystatin C (CysC)
concentration in children with lymphomas.
Methods: 23 newly diagnosed patients with lymphoma
were included in this study. Male/female ratio was 15/8
with a median age of 8 years (range: 3-17 years). Eleven
patients were Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) and 12 were
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Cystatin C was
studied at the time of diagnosis and in remission.
Results: In whole group, CysC concentrations at
diagnosis and remission were 0.92±0.28 mg/L and
0.89±0.2 mg/L, respectively (p=0.7). In NHL group,
CysC concentrations at diagnosis and remission were
0.87±0.25 mg/L and 0.86±0.18 mg/L, respectively
(p=0.9). The CysC concentration of the HL group at
diagnosis and remission were 0.92±0.14 mg/L and
0.98±0.36 mg/L, respectively (p=0.67). No significant
- 231 -
difference was observed between HL (0.95±0.35 mg/L)
and NHL (0.94±0.33 mg/L) groups statistically. Cystatin
C concentrations in localized and advanced disease were
1.07±0.38 mg/L and 0.89±0.3 mg/L, respectively
(p=0.31). Cystatin C concentrations of the patients with
localized and advanced HL were 1.11±0.4 mg/L and
0.77±0.14 mg/L, respectively, (p=0.1). In one patient
with localized NHL, CysC concentration was 0.85
mg/L, whereas in patients with advanced NHL, CysC
concentration was 0.95±0.35 mg/L.
Conclusions: Even though patient population is a small
group in this study, CysC level was higher in localized
than advanced disease. This study has been supported
by a grant from Terry Fox Research Foundation
RBC TRANSFUSIONS IN THE PEDIATRIC
INTENSIVE CARE DEPARTMENT: THE
EFFECT OF EDUCATION
D Bogaert, K F M Joosten
Department of Pediatric Intensive Care, Erasmus MC-
Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: A paucity of clinical evidence
with respect to red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in
critically ill children has resulted in a large variation in
transfusion practice and guidelines among paediatric
intensivists. The lack of consensus might result in the
use of liberal hemoglobin (Hb) thresholds for RBC
transfusions. However, in critically ill adults a restrictive
transfusion strategy (Hb <4.3 mmol/L) has been shown
to be at least as effective as and possibly superior to a
liberal regime. The aim of the study was to evaluate the
effect of education on the transfusion practice in our
PICU.
Methods: All RBC transfusions prescribed between
April 2005 and March 2006 with respect to age, Hb
threshold and transfusion volume were analysed and
compared with a similar survey performed between
April 2004 and April 2005. All first RBC transfusions
per child per admittance were included in the analysis.
Results: 30 of the 540 admitted children received a
RBC transfusion (5.6%) compared to 56 of 591 children
admitted (9.5%) in the year previously. The average
RBC transfusion threshold was 4.6 mmol/L (range 2.8-
6.3) compared to 5.2 mmol/L (range 2.6-6.6). A
transfusion threshold of Hb <5.6 and <5.2 mmol/L was
recorded in 94% and 83% of these children,
respectively, versus 78% and 52% in the year
previously.
Conclusions: After education a trend towards lower Hb
transfusion thresholds was noticed even in the absence
of RBC transfusion guidelines. We hypothesize that the
introduction of universal RBC transfusion guidelines
will maximize this policy.

Gruta, Poland
Background and Aims: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA)
is the most common nutritional problem in the world.
The aim of the study was to assess the frequency of iron
deficiency (ID) and the occurrence of IDA in children
treated by family doctor in the Polish countryside.
Methods: A prospective observational cohort study of
146 healthy 7-to 48-month-old-infants from a village,
primary care clinic were screened for ID between
September 2005 and November 2005, and followed up
for a median of 24 months. ID (serum iron <50μg/dl)
and IDA (hemoglobin < 11g/dl or/and serum iron
<50μg/dl) were diagnosed. No symptoms of anemia
were noted. Health Found only these tests are available
for doctors in such clinics.
Results: Of 146 infants enrolled, 13 (11%) had ID and
23 (15.7%) had IDA. Average hemoglobin (Hb-12.3)
levels, erythrocyte count (RBC-4.8), mean cell volume
(MCV-78.1) and serum iron (Fe-81) were normal. Hb
level <11g/dl was observed in 16 children. Iron level <
50ug/dl (normal range 50-170) was detected in 13
children. Ferrous treatment was started in 25 children.
Conclusions: We suggest that all children aged 12-48
months should be screening for IDA. Determination of
hemoglobin is not the optimal way to identify children
at risk from effects of iron deficiency as it identify
patients who are iron-deficient but are not anemic.

and Transfusiology, Warsaw, Poland
Background and Aims: Hereditary spherocytosis (HS)
is the most common haemolytic anaemia in Poland.
Until recently, it has been thought, that thalassaemia is
not present among Polish population.
Methods: A 10-month-old girl, whose mother,
grandmother and aunt suffer from HS, was admitted for
diagnosis of anaemia. To check for HS we performed
AGLT and EMA test, which binds specifically to the
band 3 at lysine–430 and specific proteins’ defects by
quantification of erythrocyte membrane proteins
(calculated as g/106cells) by SDS–PAGE method. To
evaluate the genetic basis of thalassaemia, we isolated
the DNA from leukocytes and we sequenced the
promoter region, 5’UTR,3’UTR,3exons and its flanking
regions of the -globin gene. Subsequently, we used
PCR reaction to detect -thalassaemia deletions.
Results: Successive blood chemistry tests (performed at
follow-ups) showed microcytic anaemia (Hb:10.6-
2.3g/dl; RBC:4.59-5.17M/μL; MCV:55.2-63.1fl;
MCH:23.1-22.4pg) with marginally elevated
- 232 -
reticulocytes (17-22%). Bilirubin level was normal or
slightly elevated (0.5mg%-2.1mg%). Lactic
dehydrogenase was elevated (LDH:733U/L). Ferrum
level was first decreased (46μg/dl), but returned to
normal after treatment (83μg/dl). The initially normal
ferritin level (43,4μg/dl), increased subsequently to
167μg/dl. AGLT was abnormal (170sec.)-less than 5
minutes. EMA was abnormal (61.04%), with protein
band 3 deficiency. We diagnosed hereditary
spherocytosis. The MCV and MCH were markedly
below the normal levels, diagnostic investigations for
thalassaemia were performed. The levels of HbA2-3%
and HbF-0,6% were normal. Direct sequencing of -
globin gene did not show any nucleotide changes in
DNA sequence. The results of the PCR assays showed
the 3.7kb deletion one of -globin gene, indicating
+thalassaemia.
Conclusions: We diagnosed -thalassaemia ( /- 3.7)
in a girl with hereditary spherocytosis.

Department of Pediatrics,
Hospital of Amaliada, Amaliada, Greece
Background and Aims: It is well known that the
inflammation affects the platelet number. The aim of
this study was to evaluate the effects of inflammation on
platelet indices.
Methods: The admitted patients in a 12 month period,
having at least one complete blood count (CBC) from
the same coulter analyzer, were included in this study.
The CBC, including the platelet indices: mean platelet
volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW) and
platelet crit (PltCr) and the ESR were recorded.
Results: 1548 patients were included in the study. They
had mean platelet number (Plt) 413±174 x
103cells/mm3 and mean ESR 32 ±27 mm/h. The Plt and
platelet indices showed statistically significant
differences between the patients with high ESR
(>50mm/h) and the ones with low ESR (<50mm/h): (Plt
p<0.0001, MPV p=0.04, PDW p=0.02, PltCr p<0.01).
Grouping the patients according to their WBC; Group I:
WBC <4 x 103cells/mm3, Group II: WBC 4 - 15 x
103cells/mm3, Group III: WBC>15 x 103cells/mm3)
statistically significant differences of the above
parameters were recorded among the three groups: Plt
(p<0.0001), MPV (p<0.0001), PDW (p<0,0001), PltCr
(p<0.0001). Interestingly, the differences remained
significant even when the platelet parameters were
compared between the patients with high WBC >15 x
103cells/mm3 and low WBC<15 x 103cells/mm3.
However, no differences were documented between the
neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients.
Conclusions: The degree of inflammation affects the
platelet number and the platelet indices.

Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, St James University
Hospital, Leeds, UK
Background and Aims: To assess outcome of children
admitted to a tertiary PICU with Haematological /
Oncological disorders between January 2000 - 2005.
Methods: Retrospective review of case notes. Patients
admitted solely for stem cell harvest were excluded.
Results: 183 patients, mean age 7.4 years (range 3
weeks - 19 years) with Haematological / oncological
disorders were admitted during this period. Main
diagnoses were Leukaemia (36.6%), Lymphoma
(16.9%), soft tissue tumours (28.4%), other
haematological disorders (8.2%), CNS tumours (5.5%)
and bone tumours (5.5%). Indications for admission
included respiratory failure (38.4%) haemodynamic
support (22.4%) post operative care (20.8%), others
(18.4%). Febrile neutropenia (42.6%) and culture
proven sepsis (33.3%) were common problems.
Bacterial sepsis was identified in (63.9%) fungal (18%),
viral (6.5%) and mixed infections in (11.4%). Mean
duration of stay was 4.6 days. (Range 4 hours - 57 days)
Overall mortality rate was 17.5%. (Range 8.7 - 25% per
year). Mortality was highest in the bone tumour group
(25%) and lowest in the CNS tumour group (0%). 13
patients (7.1%) required renal replacement therapy. The
mortality in this group was 53.8%. Febrile neutropenia
and culture proven sepsis were associated with increased
mortality (21.8% and 26.2%). Mortality was highest in
patients with mixed (71.5%) and fungal (36.4%)
infection. Patients with negative cultures were more
likely to be discharged <48 hours (62.2% v 34.1%).
Conclusions: Overall mortality in haematology /
oncology patients admitted to PICU is 17.5%. Increased
duration of stay, culture positive sepsis and renal
replacement therapy are associated with worse outcome.
FOOD ALLERGY: CAN PRICK TEST OR CAP
VALUES PREDICT THE RESULT OF AN ORAL

Pediatría, Hospital Severo Ochoa, Leganés (Madrid),
Spain
Background and Aims: Cow’s milk protein, egg and
fish are the most common causes of food allergy. Oral
provocation challenge is election test for diagnosis. The
objective of this study is to know if we can establish a
cut off point in prick test and specific IgE values to
avoid oral provocation challenge and its possible
adverse effects.
Methods: We studied three groups of patients that had
allergy to cow´s milk protein, egg and fish with a CAP
- 233 -
value higher than 0,35 or prick test higher than 3 mm.
We collected their prick test and CAP values and we
analysed with ROC curves which cuttoff point we can
establish over of which it is very likely a positive result
of open oral provocation challenge. It is used SPSS 13.0
version program.
Results: We collected 255 patients with cow´s milk
protein allergy, 125 with egg allergy and 57 with fish
allergy. It was impossible to establish a cut off for prick
and CAP values in patients with cow´s milk protein, egg
and fish allergy because of the cut off obtained is the
highest value in all cases. (Cow´s milk protein: Prick:
16mm, CAP: 100; Egg: Prick: 11mm, CAP: 3,86; Fish:
Prick: 17mm, CAP: 12,5).
Conclusions: There is not a CAP or prick test value
over than which we can predict a positive result of oral
provocation challenge. At present oral provocation
challenge is the election test to diagnosis food allergy.

Background and Aims: FA, an autosomal recessive
chromosomal instability disorder, characterized by
congenital anomalies, is the commonest type of
inherited bone marrow failure syndrome. Objective: To
describe clinical and genetic features in three patients
with FA.
Methods: Clinical and genetic examinations was
performed.
Results: Girl 10 year old, twin from a homozygote
pregnancy. In the skin some cafe-au-lait spots (>11)
paraxial right lateral polydactyly. Pancytopenia; bone
marrow: aplastic hemoglobin electrophoresis: Hb F-
16.5% hypometropy. Karyotype: about 8% of analyzed
cells with chromatics and isochromatics, chromosomal
breakings and gaps. By the induction with DEB the
number of cells with instability increased in 10% with
the presence of radial figures of asymmetric type
between the non homologue chromosomes. Girl, the
other twin. Café-au-lait spots (>14), lingual frenulum.
Hb F-15.2% Karyotype: 20% of cells the same
abnormality increased in 22% by the induction with
DEB. Boy 4 years old: vescico-urethral reflux, at
voiding cystography, horseshoe kidney, pelvic position.
Café-au-lait spots, (>11). The thumbs of the right hand
rudimental; thumb of left hand-distal phalange duplex.
Hb F- 11.4%; kariotype: 2% of analyzed cells - the same
alterations, increased in 12%, by the induction with
DEB, presence of bicentric chromosome.
Conclusions: New discoveries in molecular biology and
genetics have unveiled some of the mysteries of bone
marrow failure syndromes. FA is a rare disorder with
variable organ abnormalities, some relatively common,
but some other rarely associated with the disease
recognition of unusual pathologies is important in order
to improve the diagnostic.

Children's Hospital, Nijmegen, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: We report the first case of
factor suppletion therapy in a premature infant with
haemophilia B and the first case of haemophilia A in a
premature born twin. Factor suppletion, control regime
and the question whether to use a central venous
catheter are discussed.
Methods: The administration of recombinant factor
concentrate was started immediately after birth in all
cases, to prevent the occurrence of intracranial
haemorrhage (ICH) and haemorrhage due to iatrogenic
injuries. Control of factor levels took place via heel
stabs or venipuncture in two cases. These infants were
given factor suppletion with minimal monitoring of the
factor level. The third infant received a central venous
catheter (CVC), which provided continuous access and
intensive monitoring of the factor level.
Results: No bleeding, thrombosis or inhibitor formation
associated with factor suppletion therapy was noted in
any of the three cases. A CVC-related sepsis was seen
which needed withdrawal of the CVC. ICH was seen in
two infants in spite of factor suppletion therapy.
However, in one of these cases, ICH was related to
diffuse intravasal clotting accompanying a sepsis in
absence of a CVC. This lead to the death of the infant,
in spite of optimal treatment.
Conclusions: Recombinant factor concentrate seems to
be safe and effective for treatment of haemophilia in
premature infants. It may reduce the occurrence of ICH.
The first choice of venous access for factor suppletion
and control should be a peripheral vein. Moreover, when
it concerns a prophylactic therapy, insertion of a CVC is
not indicated.
RISK FACTORS FOR INTRAOCLUAR
ADVANCED RETINOBLASTOMA

Clinica de Retinoblastoma - INP, Mexico DF, Mexico
Background and Aims: Retinoblastoma (RB) is the
most frequent malignant eye tumor in childhood. There
is no international agreement about risk factors for
metastatic disease. The aim of this paper is to present
the results from a retrospective study of patients
diagnosed and treated with advanced eye disease from
Mexico.
Methods: An analysis was carried out reviewing the
clinical characteristics of patients with unilateral
advanced ocular stages of RB, treated between 1994 and
2004. All patients were treated with ocular enucleation
as first treatment, The data included for the analysis
was: age at diagnosis, sex, ocular staging, anatomic site
- 234 -
of tumor involvement within the eye (choroids, lamina
cribosa), chemotherapy treatment scheme and status at
the last contact.
Results: From 1990 to 2004, 195 patients were
diagnosed and treated with advanced ocular RB; age
range was from 1 to 169 months (mean= 29.27). The
pathologist report showed choroidal involvement in 166
(83.4%) cases, and lamina cribrosa involvement in 66
(33.2%) cases. Received chemotherapy 113 (56.8%)
patients and 86 (43.2%) did not received any schema.
Overall survival was of 96.98% at 187 months of follow
up; there were no differences in overall survival within
or between groups when we compared choroidal or
lamina cribrosa affection (log rank =1.70, DF=3,
sig=.6368).
Conclusions: In our series as others, choroidal and post
lamina cribrosa involment are not risk factors to
developing metastatic disease could be treated only with
enucleation.

Yazd Medical University, Yazd, Iran
Background and Aims: Allergic rhinitis is an
increasing problem worldwide. Aeroallergens are the
most important allergens as the cause of respiratory
allergies. Air pollution and outdoor and indoor allergen
exposures may be the cause, and indoor allergens are
more important especially in children and adults with
perennial allergic rhinitis. Cockroach allergens are
among the most important and increasingly observed
cause of sensitization in allergic patients.
Methods: In our study 258 patients with allergic rhinitis
were studied and skin prick test performed to determine
the allergen sensitizations.
Results: In 137 patients (53%) cockroach allergy were
detected and in 22 patients (9%) it was the only
sensitization. In 102 patients (38%), other allergens,
mostly aeroallergens including botanical allergens,
mites and moulds were causative. 19 patients (9%)
showed no sensitizations. In the second stage of the
study skin prick test was performed on cockroach-
sensitized patients for 2 types of cockroaches, Bellattella
germanica & Bellattela Americana. 68 patients (49%)
showed sensitization to both types, 49 patients (36%)
were sensitized to B. germanica and 20 patients (15%)
to B. Americana.
Conclusions: B.germanica with 45% prevalence in all
patients with allergic rhinitis were shown to be one of
the most prevalent aeroallergens leading to signs and
symptoms of allergic rhinitis.
HUMORAL IMMUNITY IN CHILDREN FROM
TRANSYLVANIA REGION, ROMANIA

Pediatric Clinic II, Cluj-Napoca, Romania
Background and Aims: The characteristics of humoral
immunity in healthy children are well known from birth
through adolescence and so are its modifications in
different pathological states. We aimed to study the
humoral immunity in healthy children in the
geographical region of Transylvania.
Methods: We realised a 5 years prospective study on
193 healthy children of different ages. The criteria of
inclusion in the group were: the absence of any
infectious pathology during the last 3 months and the
absence of any chronical disease that would modify the
immune status. The values obtained have been
compared to those of a similar group in other regions.
The statistical processing has been made in the EPI–
INFO–5 programme, the comparison between values
has been made with the aid of the multifactorial variable
test.
Results: We have set the limits of the values, the
average and the Standard Deviation according to age
groups, concerning the seric level of the main
immunoglobuline classes. Analyzing similar groups
from two different regions of Romania, we didn’t find
any significant differencies. The comparision with
values of similar studies from literature shows
significant differences for the same age groups.
Conclusions: In area influenced by the same
environmental factors, with a relatively homogeneous
population, genetically and socio-economically, the
immune status is set between limits that can be
considered normal only for that area. In order to
estimate the immune status of a certain subject,
reference has to be made to another witness of the same
age, in the same geographical area.

Background and Aims: Spontaneous Deep Vein
Thrombosis (DVT) is extremely rare (1/51,000) in
children. We report a case of Spontaneous DVT of left
popliteal vein in a 5-year-old boy.
Methods: He presented to us with one-day history of
left calf pain, refusal of walking, hot, tender, and
swollen left calf. In view of the high D-Dimer and
clinical presentation, Venography was performed and
this confirmed the diagnosis of DVT of left popliteal
vein. There was no clinical evidence of pulmonary
embolism (PE). No cause was found on extensive
investigations.
Results: He was managed with anticoagulants and
discharged home on oral Warfarin.
Conclusions: This case highlights that though the DVT
is very rare in paediatric patients, it does occur.
Paediatricians must consider DVT in their differential
diagnosis when children present with leg pain. DVT is
rare, but can be serious, and treatment guidelines
validated in children are not available. There is a need
for an evidence based approach using information from
International Registries.

CLINICAL CORRELATES OF EARLY
READMISSION FOR SICKLE CELL DISEASE
VASO-OCLUSSIVE CRISIS
C C Skae, D Brijlall, M McGuire, P O Ozuah
Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Albert Einstein
College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA
Background and Aims: Some patients admitted for
sickle cell vasoocclusive crisis (VOC) are readmitted
within 14 days. We wondered whether there were
differences between those patients with frequent
admissions/year versus those without. Objective: To
identify the clinical correlates of patients with early
readmission for VOC.
Methods: Case-control cohort study between 1/1/2000
and 12/1/2004. Cases were readmitted within 14 days,
but did not have frequent yearly admissions for VOC.
Controls were readmitted within 14 days and had 5 or
more admissions for VOC in a given calendar year.
Cases and controls were matched for age, gender, and
ethnicity. Bivariate analyses and conditional logistic
regression assessed relative contribution of independent
variables.
Results: Of 132 early readmissions, 44 were cases and
88 were controls. Cases/Controls were successfully
matched (mean age 13 yrs vs. 14.8 yrs; for both 50%
were male, 92% Black). Cases were significantly more
likely to have higher pain scores in the 24 hours
preceding discharge, including maximum pain score/24
hours (3.6 for cases vs. 2.4 for controls; p = .048), and
average pain score/24 hours (2.9 vs. 1.7; p = .018). No
significant differences were found between the groups in
mean length of stay for index admission (6.1 vs. 5.4),
admission hemoglobin (8.5 vs. 9.5), days to readmission
(5.1 vs. 6.4), mean LOS for readmission (6.5 vs. 6.0),
and discharge hemoglobin (8.7 vs. 9.3).
Conclusions: Early readmission for VOC in patients
without frequent admissions for VOC was associated
with higher pain scores in the 24 hours preceding
discharge.
CORRELATION BETWEEN INITIAL
SYMPTOMS OF FOOD ALLERGIES AND
CLINICAL MANIFESTATION IN ORAL
PROVOCATION CHALLENGES. ARE THEY
SAFE?

Madrid, Spain
Background and Aims: Cow’s milk protein, eggs,
dried fruits and fish are the most common causes of
food allergy in pediatric age. Opened oral provocation
challenge is esencial for diagnosis, but when it is
positive, could we predict clinical syntoms? The
objetive is to describe if initial symptomalogy of disease
can predict what kind of symptoms we will found in
case of positive oral provocation.
Methods: We made a prospective study of oral
provocation challenges that we did in our Pediatrics
Service in year 2005. Variables collected were food
involved, initial symptoms, oral provocation test
symptoms and severity of them compared with previous.
Results: 366 oral provocation challenges achieved. We
found 116 (31,7%) with a positive result; skin
manifestations (53,4%), gastrointestinal (18,1%),
multiorganic (22,4%) y anaphylaxia (6%). These
symptoms were similar than initial in 50% of cases,
more severe in 25,9% and less important in 10,3%. In
function of food more frecuently implicated: Egg:
changes 50,8%; severe 34,9%; similar 61,9%; light
3,2%. Cow’s milk protein: changes 73,1%; severe
26,9%; similar 53,8%; light 19,2%. Fish: changes
30,8%; severe 7,7%; similar 76,9%; light 15,4%.
Conclusions: 1. Egg, cow's milk and fish are the more
common food allergy in our population. 2. Cow's Milk
Protein were the least predectible oral provocation
challenges of all in symptoms during the test. 3. Egg
was the food with more severe symptoms in a bigger
number of cases.
ROLE OF TLR4 AND CD14 IN LPS-INDUCED IL-
8, TNF-ALPHA AND IL-10 RELEASE IN
NEONATES
E Levi, A Mouchtouri, K Xini, S Fotopoulos,
M Xanthou
Neonatal Immunology Laboratory, B NICU, 'Agia
Sophia' Childrens Hospital, Athens, Greece
Background and Aims: Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 and
CD14, expressed on leukocytes, bind to LPS on
pathogens and trigger cytokines release. Previously we
demonstrated increased TLR4 expression and IL-8
release following LPS stimulation in neonates compared
to adults. However, the role of TLR4 and CD14 in LPS-
induced cytokine release is not clear. Aim: To
investigate CD14 expression and the role of TLR4 and
CD14 in LPS-induced IL-8, TNF-alpha and IL-10
release in neonates.
Methods: Peripheral blood from 15 preterm, 15 full
term neonates and 15 adults was cultured with LPS.
CD14 expression on leukocytes was measured by flow
cytometry. TLR4 and CD14 function was inhibited
using blocking antibodies. Cytokine release was assayed
by ELISA.
Results: Neonates exhibited increased CD14 expression
following LPS stimulation, as compared to adults.
Blocking of TLR4 inhibited LPS-induced IL-8 release
significantly more in preterms (38%) than in adults
(14%). CD14 blockade resulted in an even greater
inhibition (80%) on IL-8 release, similar in all groups.
Blocking of both TLR4 and CD14 did not result in a
further increase in the inhibition of IL-8 release. TLR4
blockade inhibited (60%) LPS-induced TNF-alpha and
IL-10 release, while CD14 blockade completely
inhibited (100%) TNF-alpha and IL-10 release in all
groups.
Conclusions: Preterms appear to dependent more on
TLR4 for IL-8 release than adults. CD14 is critical for
LPS-induced IL-8, TNF-a and IL-10 release, whereas
the role of TLR4 is less prominent, suggesting that other
- 236 -
TLRs are also involved. LPS-induced IL-8 release
depends not only on CD14 and TLR4 signalling but also
on other immune receptors.

Background and Aims: Despite advances in critical
care, morbidity and fatality rates of invasive
pneumococcal disease remain high. Cytokines play a
crucial role in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal
infection. We investigated the role of the polysaccharide
capsule and pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA),
both established virulence factors, in cytokine
production using serotype 3 strain WU2 (caps+/PspA+),
its PspA-negative encapsulated mutant JY1123
(caps+/PspA-) and its unencapsulated PspA-negative
mutant DW3.8. (caps-/PspA-).
Methods: Cytokine production by human PBMCs and
peritoneal macrophages (PM) of TLR2 and -4 knockout
mice and NF B dependent CD25-expression on TLR2
and -4 transfected CHO-cells.
Results: WU2 (caps+/PspA+) and its mutant JY1123
(caps+/PspA-) induced similar amounts of cytokines in
human PBMC, whereas the unencapsulated mutant
DW3.8 (PspA-) was significantly more potent. A TLR4
inhibitory antibody significantly inhibited TNFa
production by DW3.8 but not by the encapsulated
maternal strain WU2. In PM of TLR2-deficient mice,
cytokines by the WU2 strain were reduced to baseline
levels, whereas significant production was seen by the
capsule-negative DW3.8. PM of TLR4 deficient mice
showed an attenuated response to DW3.8. Similar CD25
was induced in TLR2 transfected CHO-cells by WU2
and DW3.8.
Conclusions: The capsular polysaccharide impedes
TLR-mediated cytokine production by S. pneumoniae.
In the presence of capsule, signaling is mainly via
TLR2, whereas in the absence of capsule other - more
potent - pathways are engaged, and TLR4 is of
importance in this signaling.
ARE WE GETTING BETTER? DRAMATIC
CHANGES IN MORTALITY IN CHILDREN
WITH SEPSIS AND PURPURA IN ROTTERDAM
S C A T Verbruggen, C M P Buysse, M de Hoog,
J A Hazelzet, K F M Joosten
Pediatric Intensive Care, Erasmus MC-Sophia
Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Meningococcal sepsis and
septic shock is a fulminant disease in young, previously
healthy children. In our PICU, overall mortality due to
sepsis and purpura was 16.1% over the past 18 years.
Since 2001 a marked drop in mortality was observed.
Methods: Between 1988 and 2006 all patients (1 month
-18 yrs) consecutively admitted with sepsis and purpura
were analysed. Retrospective comparison of two time
periods (1989-2001 (A) and 2001-2006 (B)) of inotropic
and vasopressor use in relation with severity of disease
and outcome.
Results: 285 patients were admitted with sepsis and
purpura, 45 non-survivors (16.1%). 218 patients were
admitted in period A and 67 patients were admitted in
period B. Between period A and B there was no
significant difference in age (mean 5 vs. 5,2 yrs, range
0,3 - 17 vs. 0,3 - 15,8), sex and PRISM score (18 vs. 20)
but a significant difference in mortality (20% vs. 1%).
Dopamine was significantly more used in time period A
(p< 0.05). In time period B the level of norepinephrine
used was significantly higher (0.2 vs. 0.6
microgram/kg/min (p<0.05)). There was no difference
in dobutamine use, the combination of dobutamine and
norepinephrine and overall vasopressor score in the 2
time periods.
Conclusions: We observed a dramatic decrease in
mortality in children with meningococcal sepsis since
2001 with a change in the use of dopamine and the level
of norepinephrine. It is questionable of the changes in
inotropic use might have influenced mortality and others
factors have to be determined.

Background and Aims: Fulminant meningococcal
sepsis (FMS) is a life threatening infection that can lead
to shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC). Although mortality has decreased during the last
decade morbidity is still high and 10-20% of the
survivors suffer from disabling limb ischemia because
of arterial thrombotic occlusion. Therefore thrombolytic
therapy could have therapeutic possibilities. We
describe our experiences with this treatment.
Methods: As an adjunct to our normal intensive care
management we treated four children with FMS and
severe limb ischemia with thrombolytic therapy using
recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA).
Results: The table depicts various patient
characteristics. Thrombolytic therapy consisted of rt-PA
in a dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg/hr for several hours. All
children were also treated with fresh frozen plasma.
Three patients had a marked clinical response with
return of peripheral pulsations and improvement of skin
perfusion shortly after initiation of rt-PA therapy. No
patient had signs of cerebral bleeding. One patient died
with extensive necrosis and all children suffered from
adrenal insufficiency.
- 237 -
Conclusions: Thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA can
potentially prevent from serious disabling limb
amputations. However the benefits must always be
weighted against possible bleeding complications.

Background and Aims: This study was undertaken to
investigate clinical features of fulminant (lethal within
72 hours of onset of illness) late-onset sepsis (LOS) in
the neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and
antimicrobial resistance.
Methods: Retrospective analysis of the medical records
was conducted of LOS (occurring after 3 days of age) in
infants in a NICU over a 5-year period (2001-2005).
Results: The mainly causative organisms of LOS were
S. aures (27%), S. epidemidisis (22%), Candida sp.
(19%), Enterococcus sp. (7%) and Klebsiella sp. (7%),
and fulminant infection was developed in 11 (4%) of
them. Frequency of fulminant LOS was highest for
Klebsiella sp., 5 of 24 (21%), and followed by E. coli, 1
of 10 (10%). Although Gram-positive organisms caused
211 (59%) episodes of LOS, fulminant sepsis was
considerably low: Enterococcus sp. with 4% and S.
aures with 2%. Also Candida sp. had a 3% rate there. In
rate of antimicrobial resistance, S. aures was 74% to
oxacillin and Enterococcus sp. was 23% to vancomycin.
Resistant rate to cefotaxime of Klebsiella sp. and E. coli
was 46% and 33% respectively, and all 6 (18%)
organisms causing fulminant sepsis of them were
resistant to cefotaxime.
Conclusions: Fulminant LOS in the neonates is strongly
associated with Klebsiella infection (P<0.005), and a
proper drug choice is necessary based on the major
pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns in each
one of the NICUs to prevent acute death.
A RANDOMIZED STUDY OF ORAL CARE
INFLUENCE ON OROPHARYNGEAL
COLONIZATION OF CRITICALLY ILL
CHILDREN
D M Kusahara, M A S Peterlini, W B Carvalho,
M L G Pedreira
Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil
Background and Aims: The oropharyngeal
colonization by endogenous flora or pathogens obtained
exogenously from the intensive care environment has
been described as one of the major routes for acquiring
VAP. Oral care intervention has been described as
capable to prevent VAP in adult patients. The aim of
this study was to analyze the influence of oral care
interventions on oropharyngeal colonization of critically
ill children.
Methods: Prospective randomized controlled study
realized in a PICU in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. The
research was approved by the ethics in research
committee. The sample was composed of 56 children,
29 (51.8%) in the Control Group-CG (mechanical
intervention) and 27 (48.2%) in the Experimental
Group-EG (0.12% chlorhexidine). Microbiological
cultures of oropharyngeal secretions was obtained 24
(CI), 48 (CII) and 96 (CIII) hours after admission.
Results: No significant difference in the groups was
verified regarding children's characteristics: age
(p=0.854), gender (p=0.945), skin color (p=0.983),
nutritional status (p=0.531), clinical conditions of mouth
(p=0.414) and teeth (p=0.343) and, infections (p=0.222)
at admission. The main microorganisms identified were
Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus epidermidis,
Moraxella spp, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas
aeruginosus, Acinetobacter baumanni, Enterobacter ssp,
and Klebsiella pneumoniae. No global significant
influence of oral care on microorganisms colonization
was observed: CI to CII (p=0.085) and CII to CIII
(p=0.927). An increase of pathogens was observed in
CG at CII (33.3%) and CIII (30.8%); in EG increase
was only observed at CIII (25.0%).
Conclusions: There was no significant differences on
the global analyzes of pathogens colonization in the
studied groups, nonetheless a lower increase of
pathogens was observed in the EG. Acknowledgments:

Background and Aims: White blood cells (WBC, C-
reactive protein (CRP) and sedimentation rate (SE) are
important predictors of bacterial infections. Evaluation
of WBC, CRP, SE, and fever (F) in early diagnosis of
bacterial infection.
Methods: This study involved 198 hospitalised and 96
treated in primary pediatric care settings. Hospitalised
patients are divided in two groups. 1a with serious
bacterial infection (SBI), 1b viral infections. Outpatients
are also divided in two groups. 2a bacterial infections
and 2b viral infections. Diagnostic criteria where blood
culture, urine culture, cerebro spinal fluid culture,
pharynheal swab, chest x-ray. Values of WBC, CRP, SE
and F where estimated at the beginning of the disease
and are compared with definitive diagnosis. Beginning
- 238 -
of disease is defined to be 3, 69th day for hospitalised
patients and 2, 69th day for outpatients.
Results: Values of WBC, CRP, SE and F are compared
between each others, such as between the groups
(Mann-Whitney U test, ANOVA). There is no
significant difference between hospitalised and
outpatients concerning WBC and SE. 1a group has
significantly higher WBC and SE than 1b group
(p<0.001) 1a group has significantly higher SE than 1b
group (p<0.001), and 2a group has significantly higher
SE than 1b. Fever and CRP where significantly higher
in hospitalised than outpatient group (p<0.001). 1b
group has significantly lower fever than 2a group and 2b
group (p<0.001). 1a group and 2a group have
significantly higher CRP than 1b group and 2b group.
Conclusions: CRP and fever are better early predictors
of bacterial infections than SE and WBC.
NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS AMONG
VENTILATED PRETERM INFANTS
E Petkovska, S Jancevska
Department of Neonatology, University Clinic of
Gynecology and Obstetrics, Skopje, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Neonatal nosocomial infection
(NI) is a very important cause of mortality and
morbidity among ventilated infants in neonatal intensive
care units (NICU). The aim of this study was to
calculate the incidence and to identify the risk factors
for NI among ventilated preterm infants in NICU.
Methods: We performed a prospective study during a
period of 2 years (2003/2004) among ventilated preterm
infants in NICU at University Clinic of Gynecology and
Obstetrics in Skopje-tertiary care center for 'transport-
in-utero'. Infections were defined as nosocomial when
occurring >48 hours after birth.
Results: 123 discharged patients who were ventilated
are included. 87/123 (70.7%) had conventional
mechanical ventilation (CMV) and 36/123 (29.3%) had
nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP)
treatment. 31/123 (25.2%) patients experienced 40 NI
during this period. 16/36 (44.4%) NCPAP ventilated
patients had NI vs. 15/87 (17.2%) patients treated with
CMV (p<0.05). Sepsis represents the most common NI,
followed by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
9/15 (60%) of patients with NI treated with CMV had
VAP vs. 2/16 (12.5%) of NCPAP ventilated ones
(p<0.05). The rate of sepsis was not significantly
different between two ventilated groups of patients.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonie
were the most frequently isolated microorganisms from
endotratracheal positive aspirates, while Streptococcus
epidermidis and Staphylococcs aureus were the
microorganisms most frequently isolated in positive
blood cultures.
Conclusions: This study demonstrated a high incidence
of NI among ventilated preterm infants, related to type
of mechanical ventilation, interventions and process of
care in our NICU. The results will be used for further
surveillance and improving of prevention strategies in
our NICU.
MENINGOCOCCAL CLUSTERS - NOT GONE
YET!

Department of Paediatrics, Our Lady of Lourdes
Hospital, Drogheda, Co. Louth, Ireland
Background and Aims: Meningococcal C vaccine
introduced in Ireland in October 2000 has had a major
impact in reducing mortality in Meningococcal sepsis.
Clusters of group B disease have not been reported in
Ireland.
Methods: We describe a cluster of Meningococcal
group B serogroup diseases occurring in the North-
eastern Health board region.
Results: A six-week-old male infant presented to the
emergency department with a disseminated pupuric
rash. Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, inotropic
agents, and ventilation the infant died four hours after
presentation. Meningococcal PCR revealed group B
serogroup. Four hours later on the same day, a fifteen-
month-old female infant presented with a one-day
history of vomiting, pyrexia, and petechial rash.
Meningococcal PCR grew group b serogroup with the
same subtype as the first case. The third case was a
fourteen- month old infant who had been unwell the
previous week and had a 12-hour history of petechial
rash, pyrexia and lethargy. Meningococcal PCR again
revealed serogroup b with same subtype. The fourth
case, a ten-month-old female infant was a first cousin of
the third case and had been in contact with him 48 hours
prior to his admission. Meningococcal PCR again
revealed group B serogroup however with a different
subtype.
Conclusions: Our cluster of four cases of serogroup b
invasive Meningococcal disease in one week constitutes
a cluster hitherto unreported in Ireland. This cluster
highlights the ongoing burden of group B disease and
the challenge of finding an effective vaccine.

Background and Aims: Invasive fungal infection is an
increasingly common cause of mortality and morbidity
in very low birth weight (VLBW) babies. We aimed to
evaluate the impact of selective fluconazole prophylaxis
on incidence of invasive fungal infection, examine cost
implications and emergence of fluconazole resistance in
Neonatal Intensive Care.
Methods: Retrospective study of babies < 1500g birth
weight admitted to NICU in a period 1 year before and
after implementation of an antifungal prophylaxis
guideline. Eligibility: Birth weight < 1500g with an
additional risk factor: (1) Colonization of candida
- 239 -
species from surface sites with a central venous catheter,
(2) 3rd generation Cephalosporin treatment or (3) total
duration of antibiotic therapy >10 days. Prophylaxis
consists of: Fluconazole 6mg/kg for 3 weeks. Dose
interval every 72 hours during the first 2 weeks of life.
Thereafter, dose interval reduced to 48 hourly until 3
weeks old when daily fluconazole is given.
Results: One hundred and twenty-one and 107 VLBW
infants admitted in year before and after guideline. Data
available in 110 and 100 charts respectively. Six (6/121)
babies developed invasive fungal sepsis before the
guideline compared with only one (1/107) after. The
cost of prophylaxis was less than that of treating infants
with fungal sepsis prior to the guidelines. There was no
evidence of emerging resistance to standard anti-fungal
treatments.
Conclusions: Selective anti-fungal prophylaxis has
reduced invasive fungal sepsis in our unit. Prophylactic
therapy with fluconazole is relatively inexpensive. There
was no evidence of fluconazole resistance emerging.

Background and Aims: Even in the antibiotic era,
streptococci infected healthy infants/children may
require PICU admission because of serious and life-
threatening conditions. Differently from multi-resistent
Gram negative bacteria or fungi, which are increasingly
recovered in PICU setting, antibiotic susceptibility did
not represent the main problem we encountered in our 3
patients with streptococcal sepsis.
Methods: Illustrative cases. Setting: Pediatric Intensive
Care Unit at a University Hospital.
Results: Clinical experiences including 3 sepsis
episodes from different streptococcal strains are
reported. All children were previously healthy and no
predisposing factors were identifyied. Main PICU
complications and their management are illustrated in
Table 1.
Conclusions: Streptococcal infections remain diffusely
present among pediatric population, while severe and
life-threatening cases have become consistently rarer.
Even in previously healthy infants/children - in the
absence of antibiotic-resistant streptococcal species (due
to increasing penicillin resistance or intermediate
susceptibility) - a rapidly evolving picture of sepsis and
septic shock may occur. Emergency physicians and
intensivist should be aware of these uncommon
complications, needing a complex physiopathological
support besides antimicrobials. In our experience, only a
highly individualised approach permitted to achieve a
significant improvement of the patient clinical status.

Background and Aims: Meningococcal disease (MCD)
is responsible for a large number of deaths among
children worldwide. Diagnosing meningococcal
septicaemia is simple when it presents with classical
signs, especially the purpuric rash. However,
meningococcaemia may present as a febrile illness
mimicking common childhood illnesses. In these
circumstances, misdiagnosis results in significant
morbidity or death. This study assesses the diagnostic
accuracy of procalcitonin in the setting of
meningococcal disease.
Methods: Clinical and laboratory data in two
emergency department cohorts (A and B) were analysed
between 2002 and 2005, within New Zealand's
serogroup B epidemic.
Results: Cohort A consisted of 84 children (<14 years
old), with confirmed MCD. Cohort B consisted of 1003
consecutively recruited emergency department febrile
children, with 18 cases of MCD diagnosed. Within the
MCD cohort (cohort A), the procalcitonin geometric
mean was 21.6ng/mL. The overall sensitivity of
procalcitonin, using a 2.0ng/mL cut-off (as defined by
the ROC analysis in cohort B), was 0.96 (95% CI 0.90-
0.99). Procalcitonin was correlated with whole blood
meningococcal load (r=0.47) and Glasgow
Meningococcal Sepsis Prognostic Score (r=0.42). Mean
whole blood meningococcal load was 3.7 Log10
- 240 -
cfu/mL. Within the febrile presentation cohort (cohort
B) the specificity of procalcitonin in MCD was 0.84
(95% CI 0.82-0.86), positive and negative likelihood
ratios were 6.0 and 0.05 respectively, and sensitivity
was 0.94 (95% CI 0.73-0.99). The area under the ROC
curve was 0.93 (SE 0.04).
Conclusions: Procalcitonin is an important clinical tool
in children with non-specific febrile illnesses when the
possibility of meningococcal disease is present. The
diagnostic accuracy surpasses other laboratory markers.

Background and Aims: In the absence of universal
varicella vaccination in France, we describe the clinical
features of paediatric varicella patients admitted through
the emergency department (ED) of the Armand-
Trousseau Children hospital in Paris and the evolution
in reasons of admission during a longitudinal period of
eleven years.
Methods: Retrospective cohort study from March 1990
to February 2001.
Results: 108 children were hospitalized for varicella
during these 11 years, of whom, 64 (60%) were under 2
years of age. All but one were immunocompetent. The
main cause of admission was the presence of at least one
complication (83,3%) classified as: cutaneous (34%,
cutaneous superinfections), digestive (19,8,%, mainly
food intolerance), respiratory (17,6%, mainly
bronchiolitis and pneumonia), neurological (15,3%,
mainly febrile seizures) and Ear-Nose-Throat
complications (8,8%, mainly acute otitis media). During
the studied period, the annual number of hospitalizations
increased. The rate of complications as a cause for
hospitalization remained stable but cutaneous
superinfections emerged as the first complication.

Background and Aims: Pediatrics units are risky units
regarding the nosocomial infections. The aim of this
study is to evaluate the hand washing practices and
bacterial hand floras of the student nurses doing
applications in pediatrics units.
Methods: The study was carried out in March 2006,
with the participation of 41 students. The data regarding
the hand washing practices of the students was collected
by means of the questionnaire. In the study the hand
flora samples were taken. After putting 0.9% NaCl in
glass tubes and sterilizing in autoclave, the samples
were taken from the hand palms and fingers by rubbing
with a sterile cotton-rod. The sowing was carried out in
a way that one colony fell to 5% sheep blood agar. The
samples were evaluated after a 48-hour incubation
period in a 5-10% CO2 environment in 37 C. The
percentage method and chi-square test were used in the
statistical evaluation.
Results: Of the samples taken pre hand washing,
coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) reproduced in
58.6%, while alpha hemolytic streptococcus reproduced
in 2.4%. Of the samples taken post hand washing, CNS
reproduced in 39%, alpha hemolytic streptococcus
reproduced in 2.4%. There found to be a statistically
meaningful difference between the floras before and
after the hand washing (p < 0.05).
Conclusions: In order to prevent the contamination of
the probable nosocomial pathogens, the subjects of
proper hand washing techniques and the protection
against the hospital infections should be given
importance in the clinic education of the students.
DETERMINATION OF ANTIBIOTIC
RESISTANCE OF COMMON BACTERIAL
NEONATAL PATHOGENS IN A NICU WITHIN A

Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, General Hospital of
Nikea, Piraeus, Greece
Background and Aims: Neonatal infections constitute
the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality.
The study's aim was to detect possible changes in
antibiotic resistance of the most common bacterial
pathogens involved in early (EO) (<72h), late (72h-28d)
(LO) and very late onset (>28d) (VLO) neonatal
infections in a NICU within a two year period (2004-
2005).
Methods: 44 positive blood culture confirmed
septicemias were recorded in 37 neonates (full
term+premature) out of 656 admissions (6.7%) in 2
years. Of those 9%, 61.3% and 29.5% were EO, LO and
VLO infections respectively. Staph.epidermidis was the
- 241 -
predominant isolated pathogen in each of these periods
followed by group B Streptococcus in EO infections,
Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter div. Klebsiella sp,
Candida and Enterococcus in LO infections and
Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus sp. Klebsiella sp,
and Candida in VLO infections.
Results: Staph.epidermidis proved resistant to -
lactams, whereas emerging resistance developed to
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, gentamycin, fusidic
acid and clindamycin. However, it remained highly
sensitive to teichoplanin and vancomycin. Although
Enterobacter cloacae has developed partial and/or
complete resistance to -lactams, cephalosporins,
aminoglycosides, aztreonam and piperacillin /
tazobactam, it is sensitive to carbapenems. Citrobacter
behaves in a similar manner displaying complete
resistance to -lactams, cephalosporins,
aminoglycosides and aztreonam, partial resistance to
piperacillin/tazobactam and increased sensitivity to the
use of carbapenems and cefoxitin. Finally, Enteroccocus
is sensitive to most antibiotic categories ( -lactams,
aminoglycosides, carbapenems) whereas Klebsiella and
Candida respond to the use of piperacillin/tazobactam,
carbapenems and flucytosine, respectively.
Conclusions: Knowledge of emerging resistance to
antibiotics is imperative in planning treatment and
therapeutic modalities for infection control.

Background and Aims: The aim of the present work
was to evaluate the usefulness of a real-time PCR assay
for the detection of Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) and
genogrouping on skin lesion biopsies in patients with
purpura fulminans (PF).
Methods: Monocentric retrospective study. All patients
admitted between January 2000 and January 2006 to
ICU with a final diagnosis of PF and for which skin
biopsy and blood cultures were performed were
included. These samples were used for culture and real-
time PCR amplification. Quantitative variables were
compared using McNemar's test. p value of < 0.05 was
considered significant.
Results: Forty patients (31 children and 9 adults) were
included. When Nm PCR was performed on skin biopsy
(34 cases), results were positive in 100% of the cases
compared to only 14,7% for skin culture (p=0.0001).
PCR genogrouping on skin biopsy was positive in
58,8% of the cases compared to 14,7% for skin culture
(p=0.007). When Nm PCR was performed both on skin
biopsy and blood (17 cases), results for skin biopsy were
positive in 100% of the cases compared to 58.82% for
blood (p=0.0233). PCR genogrouping on skin biopsy
was positive in 58,8% of the cases compared to 35,3%
for blood (p=0.045).
Conclusions: In all the samples (skin biopsy, blood, and
cerebrospinal fluid) PCR was better than methods of
culture. In suspected PF cases, skin biopsy provides a
better chance to identify Nm and its genogroup than
blood, especially when PCR methods are used. This
could help the implementation of public health
interventions, especially concerning a vaccination
policy.
BLOOD CULTURE ISOLATES DURING 10
YEARS IN A TERTIARY PEDIATRIC
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Coimbra’s Paediatric
Hospital, Coimbra, Portugal
Background and Aims: Sepsis is a common cause of
morbidity and death in critically ill patients, and blood
culture (BC) samples are drawn in an effort to identify a
responsible pathogen and guide therapeutic. The authors
analysed positive BC from the Paediatric Intensive Care
Unit (PICU) and the annual evolution of antimicrobial
susceptibility.
Methods: All medical records and database of children
with BC 48h after admission, from 1996 to 2005 were
retrospectively reviewed.
Results: The total number of children admitted during
this period was 3469. A BC was obtained from 1512
children and yielded a pathogen in 186 cases (12,3%
positive BC; 5,4/100 admissions). The mean distribution
of positive BC per year was 18,6 (range from 36 in 1997
to 8 in 2004). Gram-positive bacteria dominated with
coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) as the most
frequent isolate in 67 cases (32%). Following CoNS, the
4 most frequent isolates were: E. coli in 15 (8%),
Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 10 (5,4%), Enterococcus in
10 (5,4%) and Staphylococcus aureus in 11 (5,9%).
There were 4/11 cases (36%) of Methicillin-resistant S.
aureus (MRSA). Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus
Pneumoniae hasn’t been found. An intravascular
catheter was present more often when CoNS were
isolated as compared to other organisms.
Conclusions: Our microbiological pattern is dominated
by gram-positive flora, which is in agreement with
previous studies. MRSA increased from 21% (in a prior
10-year survey of our PICU) to 36%, being all
susceptible to vancomycin. Prevention and control
strategies should focus on MRSA, among others.

Background and Aims: To describe the neurological
complications of varicella infection in immuno-
competent children.
Methods: Clinical records of patients older than 1
month of age admitted with varicella from 1987 to 2005
were reviewed. Immunodepressed patients were
excluded.
Results: During the study, 374 patients were admitted
with varicella, 61 with neurological complications
(16%). Cerebellitis was the most frequent complication
observed (n=19) and the one which appears the latest
(6.2±2.7 days from the beginning of exanthema). Febrile
seizures appear early (1.7±0.9 days) and occur in
younger children than encephalitis and meningitis do.
The CSF analyse was normal in cerebellitis. 80% of
meningitis presented more than 100 cels/mL leukocyte
count and an elevated protein concentration (> 90
mg/dL) in CSF sample. 66% of encephalitis cases
presented a moderated increase of protein concentration
(45-90 mg/dL) and of leukocyte count. (10-100
cels/mL). Varicella-zoster virus serology was made in
CSF in 5 cases (3 meningitis and 2 encephalitis), being
positive in 4. PCR was made in CSF in 3 patients with
encephalitis, being negative in all of them. Admission
time was shorter in seizures (5±2 days) and longer in
encephalitis (10.8±4 days). All cases cured with out
sequels. In the first 15 years, 3.6 cases/year were
diagnosed and in the last 4 years, 1.7 cases/year.
Conclusions: Age of patient, time pass from the
beginning of exanthema, symptoms and CSF analyse
allow us to distinguish the three more frequent
complications. These seem to be decreasing, probably
due to the increase rate of vaccination.

Background and Aims: We aimed to determinate the
incidence of term newborns with birth asphyxia
transported by the transport teams of Paris area, to
analyse the difficulties of management and identify
which of them require new therapeutic strategies.
Methods: A prospective study was performed among
term babies from six months in 2002 in paediatric
transport team units. Inclusion criteria were the
association of one criterion of foetal distress during
delivery and at least one criterion of neonatal asphyxia
or one criterion of anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.
Data were analysed with Epi-info.
Results: 1576 newborns were transported. 101 were
included (mean gestational age: 39,3 +/ -1,7 weeks;
mean birth weight: 3155 +/- 627g). Half of them were
born in level one maternities. 87 received resuscitation
care and 20 had a10 min Apgar <5. For 50% of them,
the request for transfer was 55 min after birth and
transportation of the neonates was completed after 3
hours. 86 were referring with ventilatory support. Four
were included in hypothermia protocol at arrival in
intensive care unit, 31 had a severe encephalopathy, 22
had multiple organ failure, 26 died. Babies with 10 min
Apgar score <5, or who arrived in intensive care unit
after 3 hours of life had more severe morbidity.
Conclusions: Paediatric transport teams transfer babies
with critical initial state. Neurological and systemic
complications are severe. Request for transfer should be
made earlier in order to enable a better impact of new
neuroprotective strategies.

USA
Background and Aims: Pediatric CT imaging
frequently requires the administration of oral contrast.
Dilute gastrograffin can be consumed (either orally or
via nasogastric tube) up to 500 ml volume, with a
typical “NPO” time interval of 30-90 minutes between
ingestion and acquisition of CT images. Many pediatric
patients require sedation to ensure immobility. The
aspiration risk of pediatric patient’s with oral contrast
who undergo subsequent sedation for CT imaging, has
never been specifically studied.
Methods: At Boston Children’s Hospital, there is a
defined sedation protocol for patient’s undergoing CT
sedation after ingestion of oral gastrograffin. There are
defined clinical criteria which must be met for a patient
to receive sedation. Absolute contraindications would
include uncontrolled/unpredictable vomiting or
gastroesophageal reflux, or a positive swallow study.
Sedation consists of intravenous pentobarbital with
fentanyl, if needed. A computerized sedation database
tracks patient demographics and outcome. This database
was retrospectively queried for aspiration events on all
patients who received oral contrast with subsequent
sedation since 1997.
Results: Since 1997, there have been a total of 4.126
sedations for CT imaging. 492 patients received oral
contrast1.5% dilute gastrograffin. There was one
incident of vomiting which occurred after the study,
with no subsequent sequela. Patient suffered no hypoxia,
oxygen desaturation, need for airway management
(positive pressure ventilation or endotracheal intubation)
or clinically recognized aspiration.
Conclusions: The ingestion of dilute oral gastrograffin
prior to pediatric sedation for CT imaging studies
appears to be safe for patients who do not have
uncontrolled gastroesophageal reflux or vomiting.

Background and Aims: To find out if there are
differences in the regime of prescribing of stimulant and
non-stimulant medications in Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) patients who are
treated by Paediatricians and Child Psychiatrists.
Methods: We reviewed the case notes of ADHD
patients aged 15 to 16 years old who were treated in a
Paediatric Service in Doncaster and a neighbouring
CAMHS Service in Rotherham. A total of 71 patients
were identified. Forty four (62%) children were treated
by paediatricians and 27 (38%) were treated by
Psychiatrists.
Results: Short acting Methylphenidate was prescribed
more by Paediatricians than by Psychiatrists (61%
versus 11%) respectively. Long acting Methylphenidate
was prescribed more by Psychiatrists than by
Paediatricians (74% versus 18%) respectively.
Dexamphetamine was given to 20% of patients
attending Paediatric Services compared to none (0%)
patients attending CAMHS Services. Atomixitine was
given to 7.4% of patients attending CAMHS compared
to none (0%) patients attending the Paediatric Services.
Conclusions: Psychiatrists tend to prescribe more the
newer generation long acting stimulant (Concerta) and
non-stimulant (Atomixitine) medications, which are
known to be more expensive but also more preferable by
patients and teachers as they are given once daily in the
morning. The new NICE guidelines 2006 on the use of
medications for ADHD should be used step by step by
Paediatricians and Psychiatrists in order to avoid huge
differences in prescribing, reduce cost of spending on
drugs if necessary, and increase patients' confidence in
our treatment regime.

Department of Paediatrics, Southend University
Hospital, Westcliff on sea, Essex, UK, 2
School and Child
Health, Ramsgate, Kent, UK
Background and Aims: ADHD is a lifespan disorder
and there is often a need for long term medication.
Involving children and their carers in the choice of
formulations and delivery methods promotes
concordance. Data on children's choice of ADHD
medication is scanty. The objective of this survey was to
investigate the children's views and choice of
formulations, delivery methods, duration of action and
the preferred mode and source of receiving information
about medication and side effects.
Methods: Views of randomly selected children
attending ADHD clinics in South Essex and East Kent
was obtained using an anonymised questionnaire. Each
responses was rated from 0-10 (Likert scales).
Results: 122 questionnaires were analysed using SPSS
version 10. Around 20% children preferred syrup. 80%
wanted a flavoured medication. (40% strawberry
flavour). 94% wanted a round tablet. (70% pea size).
42% wanted the effect of the drug to last 24 hours. Only
1% wanted information from the Doctors. 86%
preferred the cartoons followed by the internet as a
mode of receiving information.
Conclusions: Children's choice of medicine can be
diverse in nature. Majority of children in an ADHD
clinic sample preferred a pea size, round tablet of
strawberry flavour that worked for 24 hours. Larger
studies of this nature are warranted to improve children's
drug compliance.

Background and Aims: Postpartum depression have
important implications for both mother and child health.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the associations of
postpartum depression both with infants’ feeding, sleep,
growth, and developmental patterns, and with infants’
behavioral states, as perceived by such mothers at each
visit during follow-up.
Methods: The study was conducted at the 1st, 2nd, 4th,
6th, 9th, and 12th well-child visits. One hundred and
three mothers and infants were participated to the study
during the first month. At the end of the study sixty-
eight mother-infant pairs regularly attended the whole
visits. Self-report questionnaires have been applied to
mothers with the purpose of eliciting infant feeding and
sleep patterns, maternal sleep patterns, and the maternal
perception of infant behavior at each visit. Denver II
Developmental Screening test has been employed to
infants, and the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale
(EPDS) has been employed to mothers at each visit.
Results: Mothers with higher depression scores were
more inclined to report infant feeding and sleep
problems, and infant colic. They perceived their infants
more hardly controlled, unhappy, disturbed, frequently
crying, and hardly-cared. The infants’ daily weight gain
was found sufficient. EPDS mean scores at the first
month visit and the second month visit were relatively
higher.
Conclusions: Mothers with depressive symptoms
especially at early stages after delivery may define
problems associated to their infants’ feeding, sleep,
colic, and behavior. Well-child visits provide an
appropriate setting for diagnosing maternal postpartum
depression, and preventing probable negative impacts of
such depression on infants.

Background and Aims: We know that exposure to and
absorption of safety education help inspire effective
personal action to reduce the injury risks. The aim of
this study was examine the effectiveness of two
different child accident prevention education program to
engagement in home safety practices prevent injuries to
pre-school children’s family.
Methods: This study was performed in Ankara, Turkey.
Seventy-four parents were coming for well-child visit to
Ankara University, Social Pediatrics Department for
their children, were participated to the study. Forty-
seven parents (almost mothers) were taken an interactive
education program for home safety practices prevent
injuries in the hospital. An education brochure was just
given to other twenty-seven parents. One month later,
home safety practices of these two groups’ parents were
evaluated with a home visit and researchers measured
knowledge level of the mothers about injury risks.
Results: The knowledge levels of the mothers in
interactive education group were significantly higher
than the other mothers’. There were many hazards
identified in the homes studied, but no difference
between both groups. However, safety improvement
was significantly higher in the interactive education
group.
Conclusions: Parental attitudes are an important
consideration in designing successful injury
interventions. Our results suggest that the focused to
home safety education in hospital was an effective
intervention in knowledge of parents and home safety
practices for prevent injuries of their children.

American Academy of Pediatrics,
North Washington, DC, USA
Background and Aims: Securing public support for
medical research and education depends heavily upon
developing effective communication with policymakers,
elected and appointed, the media and the public at large.
Effective advocacy also requires the research
community to coordinate efforts and to present a
coherent, unified message. Methods: In North America,
three major societies representing pediatric
investigators, scholars and academic administrators are
the American Pediatric Society, Assn of American
Pediatric Chairs (AMSPDC) and Society for Pediatric
Research. For 22 years advocacy/public affairs of these
three major societies have been conducted by a joint
Public Policy Council (PPC) with two members from
each who also serve as representatives to the AAMC
Council of Academic Societies and to the American
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Federal
Government Affairs. Logistical and advocacy support is
provided by the AAP capital office and activities are
coordinated via a monthly conference call. Results: As
measured by impact at the annual spring meeting of the
Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS), the PPC has had
significant success. A comprehensive report of
legislative and government affairs relevant to research
and education appears in the annual PAS meeting
program. The PPC has organized a major plenary
symposium for 13 years on topics such as training of
subspecialty pediatricians, clinical trial registries, ethics
of research in children and resident work hours. A
legislative breakfast has been conducted for 20 years.
Most significantly, the PPC has been a vehicle to unite
the American pediatric community to work collectively
for common goals. Conclusions: Coordination of public
policy/advocacy activities by three major American
pediatric socities through a common Public Policy
Council has enhanced visibility within the academic
community and more effectively serves academic
pediatrics.

Background and Aims: Clinical decision making has
three integrated phases: diagnosis, assessment of
severity, and management. Clinical decision making is
difficult due to the overlapings of the various types of
conditions. We developed a computerized triage system
(CTS) based on diagnosis algorithm and have validated
it’s accuracy.
Methods: All children visited the Pediatric Department
of the Yokohama Municipal Citizens' Hospital for the
year 2004. The patient's guardian input the patient's
general conditions and symptoms into the CTS. The
system then measured the severity level:
mild/moderate/severe (includes life threatening level).
After the examination of the patient, the Physician input
the severity level. We verified and analyzed the
difference between the CTS’ data and the Physician's
data.
Results: The data used were the 1367 randomly
sampled from the 20851 patients' visitings. The severity
level measured by the CTS was: mild 804, moderate 316
and severe 247. The severity level given by the
Physician was: mild 1107, moderate 238 and severe 22.
We put them into the 'required-for-treatment' group or
'no-treatment-needed' group for analysis. Sensitivity was
100%, specificity was 72.6%, positive predictive value
(PPV) was 46.1% and negative predictive value was
100%.
- 245 -
Conclusions: Approximately 50% of the patients was
over-triaged by the system, but there was no
underestimate. In the case of the severity level judged
mild, by the CTS, was accurate. This system will not
only support the patient, but also the Resident's decision
making for severity. In the near future, we are sure that
new CTS will provide both specificity and PPV over
80%.

Background and Aims: To evaluate the performance of
the PRISM III 24h predictive model in our PICU
setting.
Methods: Prospective observational cohort study of 300
consecutive pts. Prism III 24h predicted mortality rate
was estimated with the free for 60 days PICUEs
software version 3.2 trial. Values are mean ± SEM, p
value was set at .05.
Results: 92.3% of our pts were medical pediatric
emergencies. Mean age was 54.26 ± 2.8 mo, mean
PRISM III 24h was 8.97 ± 0.45 given a predicted
mortality rate of 11.16 ± 0.19. Overall mortality rate
was 9.7%. The performance of PRISM III scores were
assessed through discrimination and calibration
measures. Utilisation of receiver operating
characteristics (ROC) curve showed good discrimination
capability of the PRISM III scoring system for the
whole population (.892, p = .00; C.I.: .821 to .963). The
stratified performance for all age groups of the PRISM
III score in predicting mortality has been evaluated by
the Hosmer and Lemeshow’s Goodness -of- Fit Test and
showed a good calibration capability in the whole
population ( ² (3) = .234, p = .972). The Standardised
Mortality Ratio (SMR) was .87. Efficiency at admission
(mortality risk > 1%) was 76.7%.
Conclusions: PRISM III 24h performed well in
predicting the overall mortality on the whole population
of our PICU for all age groups. Effectiveness and
efficiency of our PICU population was met by an
international standard.

of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA
Background and Aims: Infants weighing less than 400
g at birth rarely survive, and little information is
available on the characteristics and outcomes of the few
survivors. In 2000, we developed the Tiniest Babies
Registry, a web-based registry of survivors with birth
weight below 400 g. The purpose of the Registry was to
collect and make available information on these
extraordinary infants.
Methods: Reports of surviving infants with birth weight
below 400 g were collected from medical and lay
publications, both print and web reports, and additional
cases were submitted by parents or medical personnel to
the Tiniest Babies Registry web site. In recent years,
most cases have been submitted by the parents and
validated by a treating neonatologist.
Results: The Registry is located at
http://www.medicine.uiowa.edu/tiniestbabies. On 1
April 2006, the Registry contained 75 infants with birth
weights ranging from 260 to 397 g and gestational ages
from 23 to 34 weeks. All infants in the Registry were
small for gestational age; 58 (77%) are girls. The
continents of birth are North America 57, Europe 14,
Asia 4. The decades of birth are 1930s 3, 1980s 7, 1990s
26, 2000s (6 years) 39. Most children have
developmental sequelae and lingering health issues. The
majority who have reached school age are in regular
classes, although some require special educational
services.
Conclusions: The Tiniest Babies Registry provides a
repository of information about the world’s smallest
surviving infants, those born weighing less than 400 g.
The predicament of these extremely vulnerable children
is daunting but not hopeless.
AIDS ORPHANS – OPTIMISING CARE FOR HIV
INFECTED CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES
C Neves, M J Brito
Department of Paediatrics, Hospital Fernando Fonseca,
Amadora, Portugal
Background and Aims: The large number of HIV-
infected women of childbearing age has resulted in a
secondary epidemics of AIDS ORPHANS defined as a
child who has lost one or both parents. A family care
providing specialist and counseling services for families
living with HIV. The purpose of this study was to
characterize the problems concerning orphan hood.
Methods: Retrospective analysis, of orphans children
born to HIV mothers, between 1999 and 2004 (6 years).
Sociodemographic data, nuclear family history, legal
issues and social situation were analysed.
Results: A total of 405 HIV families were observed,
with 429 children. Less than a quarter (24%) of children
were cared for by both parents, 53% by mother alone
and 11% by guardians or foster parents. There are 43
(10%) of orphans and 12 (27,9%) of them are HIV1
infection. The majority of the parents 38 (88,3%) came
from a Portuguese Speaking African Country and 17
(44,7%) were illegal in our country. All of them have
poor social-economical status and 18,6% have poor
housing and stay at slum. Fourteen (32,5%) of orphans
are adopted inside family and 5 (11,6%) siblings are
severely separated and adopted from different families.
- 246 -
The most of all (95,3%) have support from the social
service and two children return to its native country.
Conclusions: A strategy of care should be shared with
primary care, pediatricians should become aware of
local laws and community resources, and initiate
discussion early in the course of parenteral illness to
facilitate planning for the future care and custody of
children.

Background and Aims: Patient Safety Leadership
Walkrounds is an effective method to develop and
maintain a safety culture. Walkrounds contribute to
identify latent conditions within the system. Unlike
active failures, latent conditions can be identified and
remedied before an adverse event occurs. This leads to
proactive rather than reactive risk management. We
chose walkrounds, because the clinical setting, as a
semi-intensive paediatric unit, is a high-risk area for
sentinel events. The aim of this project is to proceed a
self-sustaining culture of safety whereby each
individual, is preoccupied with safety, and armed with
the skills to evaluate his or hers environment for
potential harm, and make appropriate changes.
Methods: It's a quality improvement design. Before and
after description is done by a Hospital Survey Safety
Culture Questionnaire. The intervention is three
walkrounds during the period from September 2005 to
September 2006.
Results: The first safety culture survey indicates that
overall perception of patient safety is positive. The
communication is open, and the answers indicate that
the culture is a nonpunitive response to error. Yet there's
room to improvement. Presently we have finished two
walkrounds and identified up to nine safety issues. The
issues have potential to harm patients. The first theme
we analyzed was the patient record. The second
walkround initiate qualitative interviews to investigate
parents and children perspective of safety.
Conclusions: It's clear that the concept proceed a
culture of safety. It visualized immediately for leaders in
a constructive way, what nurses, doctors, children and
their parents in an every day occurrence are concerned
about.

Background and Aims: In the Netherlands 95% of all
children age 0-4 year are participating in a preventive
public health care system. A. What are the possibilities
of this preventive program in screening on inherited
diseases with consequences for the family members
and/or the child? B. What is the frequency of complex
congenital disorders, demanding specific care and how
is this provided?
Methods: During a period of 5 months a genetic trained
paediatrician replaced the preventive child health care
physicians in 92 different health care sessions. Standard
procedures were followed including standard family
history, physical examination and motor and speech
development.
Results: 1085 children were examined: A) *22 (2%)
children showed on physical examination a symptom,
possibly part of a syndrome*16 (1.4%) family histories
were positive for disorders with a risk for the child and
or other family members. 7 parents were aware of the
risk. B) *7 (0.7%) children had a disorder that needed
multidisciplinary care. They visited 3-6 different
healthcare providers from the academic working sub
specialist to the local dietician on the basis of each
symptom separately. One child received integrated care.
Conclusions: With a family-history-questionnaire in a
child health preventive screening program genetic health
risks for child and family members can be detected.
Once a risk is established care is divided between
different (sub) specialists and other local healthcare
providers. Possibilities of prevention on the basis of
genetics need adjustment of health care systems and
training of healthcare providers.

Background and Aims: Pediatric trauma is the first
cause of death in children. General Medicine has been
strengthened as a specialty throughout Greece during
past decade. Aim of this study is to report the experience
of General Practitioners in pediatric trauma in Thrace,
Greece.
Methods: In total 1250 cases of pediatric trauma were
treated in Health Center of Iasmos during past decade.
The children were 767 male, and 483 female, with a
median age of 8±2,57 years old. General Practition
applied was reported and evaluated. A categorization in
three groups was made, according to age: A (<2
months), B (1-5 years old) and C (5-14 years old).
Results: Falls from adults’ bed were the first cause of
pediatric trauma in group A, burns were the first cause
in group B, and falls outside home were first in group C.
There were no deaths and major trauma cases were
transported to Hospitals of Thrace. The percentage of
need for immediate transportation was 22,16%, while
recommendations for visiting a Hospital in case of
- 247 -
arising symptoms were given in 32,24%. The rest of
cases were treated by general doctors. Information to
schools and parents was given in annual meetings and
events organized by the Health Center of Iasmos in co-
operation with the Scientific Committee of Hospitals of
Thrace.
Conclusions: Pediatric trauma is a very common
problem for peripheral Health Centers. General Doctors
have managed to offer primary care to injured children,
decide and organize transportation to Hospital when
needed and contribute in prevention via educational
events.
SPECTRUM OF SERVICES IN A PEDIATRIC,
NON-UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL: THE DRG
(DIAGNOSIS RELATED GROUPS)
PERSPECTIVE
M L Losa
Department of Pediatrics, Ostschweizer Kinderspital,
St. Gallen, Switzerland
Background and Aims: The reimbursement of
hospitals by means of patient classifications schemes is
actively discussed in Switzerland. In view of the
experiences from Germany, considerable problems with
financing are to be feared equally in Switzerland
particularly for pediatric hospitals and departments.
Methods: The patient data for 2004 and 2005 were
processed by a DRG-Grouper (APDRG-Grouper version
1.5, swiss-cw version 5.1). The resulting DRG-data
were analysed using MS-Excel tables.
Results: 6258 cases were grouped. Out of 641 possible
DRGs, 264 got at least one case. 28% of the cases were
grouped in Major Diagnostic Categories (MDC) 6 and 4
(diseases and disorders of the respiratory or
gastrointestinal system). The DRGs 777 (disorders of
the digestive tract without complications, age <18 years)
and 775 (bronchitis and asthma, without complications,
age <18 years) represented 22% of the cases. With a
cost weight (cw version 5.1) of 0.403 and 0.304
respectively these DRGs are among those with the
lowest valuation. The Case Mix Index (CMI) of the
hospital was 0.794 in 2004 and 0.832 in 2005.
Conclusions: The DRG analysis shows the following
features: 1. High in homogeneity (many DRG groups
/few cases). 2. Few low-valued DRGs with many
patients. 3. The gross CMI of a tertiary children's
hospital is comparable to that of a medium-sized adult's
hospital without tertiary services. It is obvious to
pediatric health professionals that this constellation will
be the likely origin of financial problems but this has
still to be proven by detailed data on services and costs.

Background and Aims: Implementing and maintaining
a Patient Data management System (PDMS) is an
ongoing process. Eight years after the implementation of
the PDMS, we experienced that complete and accurate
recording of data was not self-evident. As missing or
unvalidated data may negatively influence care of the
patients we used a multilevel approach to improve
completeness. The aim is to improve the documentation
of the clinical data by the PICU physicians and nurses.
Methods: On the technical level, we have tailored the
PDMS to meet our recording needs, by adding icons that
launched a number of automatic data entries to the
system. After a procedure, e.g. an arterial line insertion,
the application will, after clicking an icon, launch an
orderset and document an event automatically. By a
'breakthrough'-approach physicians and nurses were
stimulated to improve documentation and to do this on
an unambiguous manner. During the process we
collected different real time variables related to
procedures and compared these with the imported events
by the PICU staff. Every month, the results were
presented graphically to the team.
Results: Since the implementation, September 2005,
correctly documentation of intubation procedures in
patients increased of 20 to 73%. Arterial procedures
increased of 29 to 63%. However, we also learned that
completeness needs continuous attention, as we noticed
a decrease in completeness in months when the research
team did not present the graph to the staff.
Conclusions: Both technical improvements and
personal strategies are needed to improve
documentation completeness in a PDMS. Motivation of
the staff needs continuous attention.

FRACTURES, ARE WE RECOGNISING THE
SIGNS OF NON-ACCIDENTAL INJURY?
T W Bourke, V K Kumar, N P Corrigan
Department of Paediatrics, Altnagelvin Area Hospital,
Londonderry, Northern Ireland, UK
Background and Aims: A child injury surveillance
proforma exists in our emergency department to help
distinguish accidental injuries from those requiring
further expert assessment. We wished to establish if this
proforma was being used effectively in patients with
identifiable risk factors for non-accidental injury (NAI).
Methods: All patients under three years of age with
skull and long bone fractures attending our emergency
department in a one-year period were identified. Notes
were retrospectively audited for documentation of
proven risk factors for NAI.
Results: 389 children under 3 attended with injuries in
the study period of which 56 (14%) met the inclusion
criteria. Notes were available for 56 (100%) patients.
Incomplete documentation of risk factors was noted in
18 (32%). One or more risk factors were noted in 23
- 248 -
(46%). The child injury surveillance proforma was
partially or fully completed in only 6 (23%) of these. A
social services referral was made for 1 (4%).
Conclusions: The child injury surveillance proforma is
not being completed in many children at potential risk of
NAI. This may contribute to under-recognition of cases
requiring referral for further expert assessment.
Appropriate use of a child injury surveillance proforma
combined with a comprehensive system of child
protection training may help prevent this.

Illinois University, Springfield, IL, USA
Background and Aims: Patent ductus arteriosus [PDA]
is a frequent and potentially pathologic condition in
preterm infants. A simple bedside screening tool to
assess ductal patency would assist in the care of
extremely low birthweight [ELBW] infants. Our aim
was to study the utility of near-infrared spectroscopy
[NIRS] to identify a hemodynamically significant PDA
in ELBW infants.
Methods: Tissue oxygen saturation was measured by
NIRS in the lungs, brain, skeletal muscle and kidney of
20 ELBW infants. Comparisons were made between the
tissue saturation in these organs and the presence or
absence of a significant PDA by echocardiography. All
studies were performed within the first 2 weeks of life.
Results: A tissue saturation less than 50 in the kidney
identified a significant PDA on the initial evaluation
(positive predictive value [PPV] = .86, negative
predictive value [NPV] = .92, P <.01) and in paired
comparisons before and after closure of the PDA with
indomethacin (P = .05). A ratio of the tissue saturation
in the lung to the tissue saturation in the kidney of >1.0
predicted a significant PDA on the initial evaluations
(PPV = .85, NPV = .83, P <.01) and on all evaluations
(PPV = .93, NPV = .78, P <.01). This ratio also declined
significantly after closure of the PDA with indomethacin
(P = .01).
Conclusions: A portable NIRS device shows
encouraging efficacy in identifying a hemodynamically
significant PDA in ELBW infants and in assessing
pharmacologic closure of the PDA.
THE PROGNOSTIC VALUE OF AMPLITUDE
INTEGRATED EEG IN NEONATAL
SEPSIS/MENINGITIS
H J ter Horst, H de Vries, A F Bos
Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center

Background and Aims: Amplitude integrated EEG
(aEEG) is a powerful tool to predict neurological
outcome following asphyxia. Neonatal sepsis/meningitis
is also known to cause mortality and neurological
morbidity. We aimed to investigate the longitudinal
course and prognostic value of aEEG traces in newborns
suffering sepsis/meningitis.
Methods: Medical records of 13 infants that had
suffered from sepsis/meningitis and had aEEG
recordings were retrospectively investigated. Mean
gestational age was 39,3 weeks; birth weight 3490
grams. 12 infants suffered from meninigitis (11 bacterial
[2 E. Coli/9 GBS], 1 viral [enterovirus]); 1 infant had an
E. Coli-sepsis. AEEG recordings were assessed by
pattern recognition: background pattern, presence of
sleep wake cycling (SWC) and epileptic activity (EA)
were appraised. Recordings during the first 72 hours
were used for analysis. 2 infants died; 3 had an
abnormal neurologic development and 8 were normal at
follow up.
Results: 6 aEEGs had low voltage background patterns
(flat trace [FT], continuous low voltage [CLV] or burst
suppression [BS]). A normal background pattern
(discontinuous [DNV] or continuous normal voltage
[CNV]) was predictive for a normal outcome (Mann-
Whitney U; p < 0.05). 7 infants had epileptic activity
(EA) on their aEEGs. EA on aEEG was significantly
more frequent in infants with an adverse outcome
(Mann-Whitney U; p < 0.05). Sleep wake cycling
(SWC) appeared in 10 infants. Appearance of SWC was
more frequent in infants with normal outcome. (Mann-
Whitney U; p < 0.01).
Conclusions: Severely abnormal background patterns
(FT, CLV and BS), EA and absence of SWC on aEEG
are predictive for adverse outcome in infants suffering
from neonatal sepsis/meningitis.

Background and Aims: Amplitude integrated EEG
(aEEG) changes with gestational age (GA). Brain
activity is dependent on cerebral perfusion and
oxygenation. Brain ischemia is a major factor
contributing to development of periventricular
leucomalacia (PVL). We aimed to investigate if PVL
and hypotension influence aEEG in preterms during the
first weeks of life.
Methods: AEEG was recorded in 13 infants with GA of
26-32,9 weeks (median 31 wk), birth weight was 635-
1805 gram (median 1200 g). Longitudinal aEEG was
digitally recorded at weekly intervals until discharge.
AEEG was assessed by pattern recognition. In addition
the highest, lowest and mean values of the 5th, 50th and
95th centile of aEEG amplitudes were calculated. PVL
was diagnosed by serial cranial ultrasound and
hypotension by the necessity for vaso-active agents.
Results: 56 recordings (median of 3 (range 2-8) per
infant) were assessed. AEEGs were mainly
discontinuous with sleep wake cycling during first
- 249 -
recording. With increasing postmenstrual age continuity
increased, also reflected by an increase of the mean
values of 5th and 50th centiles (r=0.46, p<0.001 and
r=0.61, p<0.01 respectively). Infants with PVL grade I
(n=5) had lower values for lowest 5th and highest 5th
and 50th centiles (p< 0.05). Infants suffering
hypotension (n=3) had lower values for all centiles but
one (lowest 95th centile) (p< 0.05).
Conclusions: Digital recording makes it possible to
assess aEEG in more detail. In case of hypotension and
PVL grade I aEEG amplitudes are lower. This may be
the result of lower cerebral perfusion and might have
implications for managing hypotension in preterms.
REGIONAL BLOOD FLOW ADAPTATION IN
THE WEEK FOLLOWING SURGICAL PDA
LIGATION

Department of Neonatal, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS
Foundation Trust, London, UK
Background and Aims: Abnormalities in regional
blood flow have been reported in babies with a patent
ductus arteriosus (PDA). Our aim was to describe
regional vascular adaptation to surgical PDA ligation in
infants <1500g.
Methods: Doppler measurements of average velocity
(AV) from middle cerebral (MCA), celiac (CA), and
superior mesenteric (SMA) arteries were performed pre-
operatively, at 3-6 hours, 24 hours and 1 week post
ligation.
Results: We studied 13 infants, birthweight 802+/-222g,
GA 25.9+/-1.3 weeks and age at surgery 28+/-10.4 days.
Data are presented as mean (+/-SD) or median (IQR). (*
p<0.05 vs pre-op)
Conclusions: AV increased significantly in all vessels;
however the pattern of change differed between vessels
suggesting region specific adaptations. These data
suggest lush blood flow in the splanchnic bed
immediately after surgery and may indicate increased
vulnerability to gut injury in the early post-operative
period.

Background and Aims: To evaluate the correlation
between cerebral blood velocities by pulsed Doppler
ultrasound, severity of hypoxic ischaemic
encephalopathy (HIE) and outcome at 1 year's age in
asphyxiated newborns.
Methods: Thirty term infants (GA 37-42 weeks) with
birth asphyxia (5 min Apgar 5 or less) and 30 healthy
age-and sex-matched controls underwent pulsed
Doppler ultrasound examinations three times during the
first 24 hours of life. Systolic cerebral blood flow
velocities (SCBFV) of anterior cerebral (ACA), basilar
(BA) and internal carotid (ICA) arteries were measured.
HIE was graded using modified Sarnat criteria (stage 0-
3). Motor development by Alberta Infant Motor Scale
(AIMS) was assessed at 1 year's age.
Results: The SCBFVs during the first 24 hours of life
were similar in infants with or without HIE.
Asphyxiated infants with abnormal outcome at 1 year's
age (n = 6) had significantly higher SCBFV in all three
arteries at 24 hours of age than asphyxiated infants with
normal outcome (n = 21); in the ACA (50.8 cm/s (17.5)
vs. 32.5 cm/s (6.6), p = 0.034); in the BA (59.3 cm/s
(12.9) vs. 38.5 cm/s (9.2), p = 0.001; in the ICA (56.2
cm/s (6.8) vs. 41.0 cm/s (9.9), p = 0.04). AIMS points
(maximum 58) at 1 year's age were significantly lower
in asphyxiated infants with abnormal outcome than
other asphyxiated infants (40.3 (7.6) vs. 53.7 (4.0),
p = 0.003).
Conclusions: High SCBFV during the first 24 hours of
life seems to predict adverse outcome better than HIE
symptoms in infants with birth asphyxia.

newborns result in measurable changes in frontal theta
(3-6 Hz) activity, attenuated by oral glucose. We aimed
at investigating the type and magnitude of frontal EEG
responses to nociceptive stimuli in a larger group,
undergoing different types of noxious procedures.
Methods: Healthy term infants were investigated
(n=72), 28 (group 1) underwent a heel prick (non skin-
breaking procedure from the Neonatal Behavior
Assessment Scale). Prior to the heel-prick, 16 of the 28
infants received oral glucose and 12 water (randomised,
double-blind). Group 2 (n=21) underwent a venous
blood sample from the dorsum of the hand, and group 3
(n=23) capillary heel blood sampling for metabolic
- 250 -
screening. EEG was recorded from five derivations (F3,
F4, Cz, P3 and P4), the infants were videotaped and
assessed with the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP).
EEG power ( V2) within the theta band (3 to 6 Hz) was
calculated, an asymmetry index between right and left
frontal activity was derived using natural logarithms.
Non-parametric tests were used.
Results: In group 1, infants given glucose had lower
PIPP than those given water (p<0.05). There were no
consistent correlations between PIPP, PNA or
gestational age, and EEG power measures. There was no
change in EEG asymmetry; i.e. absolute and relative
theta power for right frontal activity in comparison to
left frontal activity.
Conclusions: The present results demonstrate that EEG
theta activity is not informative in assessing infant’s
response to noxious stimulus.
ORAL HYPERTONIC GLUCOSE FOR
ANALGESIA IN PRETERM NEWBORNS

Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Alzahra
Hospital, Isfahan, Iran
Background and Aims: A number of studies have
shown that orally administered sweet tasting solutions
reduce signs of pain during painful procedures in the
term newborns. The aim of the present study was to
compared the pain reducing effect of orally administered
glucose with that of placebo during venipuncture in
preterm infants.
Methods: A Randomized, double- blind, placebo
controlled trial was carried out at the neonatal intensive
care unit at the Alzahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran from
June to September 2005. Thirty six preterm newborns
(gestational age 28-34 weeks; postnatal age (1-14 days)
undergoing venipuncture for clinical purposes, were
enrolled in the study. Each infant was assessed two
times receiving 1 ml 30% glucose or 1 ml sterile water
by mouth, 2 minutes before venipuncture. The
behavioral pain reactions were scored with the
Premature Infant Pain Profile and duration of crying and
heart rate were measured.
Results: The PIPP scores were significantly lower in the
glucose group compared with the placebo group
(8.94±3.013 VS 11.44±3.42 respectively, P<0.001). The
duration of crying in the first 3 minutes was
significantly lower in 30% glucose compared with
placebo group (24.1±18.48 VS 39.6±26.8 respectively,
P=0.002).
Conclusions: We found that 30% glucose may be a
useful and safe analgesic for minor procedures in
preterm newborns.

Background and Aims: Newborns delivered by
vacuum extraction quite often represent a group of
infants with a haemodynamic instability. The
conventional means to measure the haemodynamic
status are not sensitive enough to assess the severity of
general, and more specifically of cerebral circulatory
imbalance. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to
study cerebral tissue oxygenation during postnatal
adaptation in these infants.
Methods: 15 newborn infants delivered by vacuum
extraction (group 1) due to fetal distress were enrolled in
this study. Immediately after birth and again after 12-24
hours of life, a near-infrared sensor (NIRO-300TM
Hamamatsu Japan) was placed over the right forehead
of the infant. The tissue haemoglobin index (THI),
oxygenation index (TOI), arterial oxygen saturation
(pre-ductal tcSaO2) and heart rate (HR) were recorded.
Mean values were calculated for the first 0-5, 5-10 and
10-15 minutes and for the measurement at 12-24 hours
(median 21 hours) of life and compared by Wilcoxon
test to 15 healthy newborns infants delivered by elective
caesarean section (group 2).
Results: No statistically significant differences of THI,
TOI, tcSaO2 and HR were observed between the two
groups. There was a trend for higher mean values of HR
and THI in infants born by vacuum extraction (group 1).
By 21 hours, the THI remained higher by 55,3% (=19.7
μM) in group 1 compared to group 2. This difference
was not significant (p=0.108), possibly due to the large
variability within the groups.
Conclusions: The postnatal adaptation of cerebral
oxygenation in newborn infants delivered by vacuum
extraction following fetal distress is similar to healthy
infants.

Background and Aims: To evaluate the role of
integrating ultrasound with antenatal ultrafast MRI
(Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in the prenatal diagnosis
of fetal malformations during 2nd and 3rd trimester of
pregnancy.
- 251 -
Methods: 2D-3D ultrasound (US) and targeted ultrafast
MRI have been used to detect a panel of fetal
malformations.
Results: Two cases of bilateral severe hydrocephalus of
whom one associated with Dandy-Walker syndrome,
one case of cleft lip and palate of whom the latter
undiagnosed by 2D-3D US, one case of right lung
sequestration, one case of placental pathology, one case
of renal dysplasia with associated ureterocele and one
case of meconium peritonitis due to ileal atresia were
diagnosed.
Conclusions: Targeted antenatal ultrafast MRI enhance
the prenatal diagnosis of fetal malformation especially
those cases regarding the definition of brain structures,
soft tissues and abdominal mass. The integration of
ultrasound with antenatal MRI may lead to better
definition of the anatomical landmarks of the fetal
malformations thus improving the prenatal counselling
of the patient and the parental decision-making strategy.
SERIAL CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW PROFILES
OF PRETERM AND TERM NEONATES

Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania Hospital,
Children's Hospital, University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia, PA, USA
Background and Aims: Cerebral blood flow (CBF)
disregulation as measured by Pourcelot’s resistive index
(RI) is GA dependent and may play a significant role in
the development of poor neurologic outcome of infants
with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and hypoxic-
ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Objective: To generate
normal reference data for neonates of different BW and
GA, and compare it to those with cerebral pathology.
Methods: Spectral Doppler blood flow profiles of the
anterior cerebral (ACA) and middle cerebral (MCA)
arteries were obtained using an Acuson XP color and
Duplex Doppler units with a 5.0/7.5 MHertz specter
probe. RI was calculated as (peak systolic velocity–end
diastolic velocity)/peak systolic velocity.
Results: Data from 400 normal infants (Group1, BW
1923±686g, GA 32.7±3.3wks) are compared to 46 with
Grade I-II IVH (Group 2, BW 1567±765g, GA
30.1±4.0wks), 14 with Grade III-IV IVH (Group 3, BW
985±345g, GA 26.7±2.5wks), and 12 with HIE (Group
4, BW 2481±1048g, GA 34.9±5.1 wks). ACA RI’s for
groups 1 to 4 were 0.74±0.08, 0.75±0.10, 0.71±0.11,
0.67±0.12SD respectively. MCA RI’s for groups 1 to 4
were 0.73±0.07, 0.77±0.07, 0.72±0.06, 0.67±0.12SD
respectively. In normals, mean RI decreased
significantly with increasing GA and BW. RI decreased
significantly with increased severity of cerebral
pathology. Neurodevelopmental screening at 2 years
was abnormal for 52% of HIE infants, 18% of grade 3-4
IVH/PVL infants as compared to 4% of matched
controls. Lowest RI (<0.5) correlated with mortality and
worst long-term outcome.
Conclusions: Doppler ultrasonography of cerebral
arteries may provide a means of identifying infants at
risk for cerebral vascular insult and poor outcomes.

Hospital, Rouen, France
Background and Aims: In adults under mechanical
ventilation, endotracheal suctioning (ES) increases
cerebral blood flow (CBF). In neonates, the effects of
ES on CBF are poorly described. To evaluate the effects
of ES on CBF velocity (CBFV) in ventilated neonates,
analyzing the respective influence of i) gestational age
and ii) perinatal asphyxia (PA).
Methods: 26 ventilated neonates, born at different term,
aged 1 to 48 hours, without sedation, with PA or not
('PA' and 'no PA' groups) were prospectively enrolled
after parental informed consent. CBFV was measured in
the pericalleous artery during 2 successive ES. The
primary end point was the variation of the mean
velocities (Vm). Results were analyzed with Student
T-test or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.
Results: Basal Vm was higher in the 'PA' group when
compared to the 'no PA' group (18,2±5,9 cm/s versus
12,8±4,6 cm/s, mean±SD, p=0,019). In the 'no PA'
group, Vm increased by 32,5±20,3% after the 1st ES
(p<0,001). Vm 2 mn after the 1st ES remained increased
when compared to basal Vm. The 2nd ES tended to
further increase Vm. In the 'PA' group, Vm did not vary
significantly after ES. Gestational age did not influence
these results.
Conclusions: We observed an increase in CBFV,
probably due to increased CBF, after ES in ventilated
newborns without PA. PA was associated with a higher
CBFV apart from any ES but the ES then did not induce
any further variation. Analyzing the effects of sedatives
on this PA-related elevated CBF, the pathophysiological
significance of which remains unknown, is an
interesting matter of research.

Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy
Background and Aims: Surgery for CDH induces a
reduction in cerebral blood volume and oxygenation.
Our aim was to identify in which phase of the surgical
procedure these changes occur preferentially.
Methods: Fourteen CDH infants were operated at a
median age of 3.8 days. Surgery was divided into 3
phases: Removal of viscera from the chest (P1), Closure
of diaphragm (P2), Repositioning of viscera into the
abdomen (P3). SaO2, Heart Rate and Mean Arterial
- 252 -
Blood Pressure (MABP) were continuously monitored
and, if necessary, FiO2 was adjusted to maintain SaO2
>80%. Changes in Tissue Oxygenation Index (TOI, %)
and total cerebral haemoglobin (tHb, mM/l), with
respect to initial baseline, were assessed by NIRS.
Values obtained at the beginning and at the end of each
phase were expressed as means±SD and compared by
the Student’s t-test for paired values.
Results: FiO2, SaO2 and MABP did not change
significantly during surgery. The lowest value of TOI
was reached at P1 in 1/14 patients, at P2 in 9/14 and at
P3 in 4/14 babies. During P1, TOI and tHb did not
change significantly; during P2 TOI (70.7±10.8 vs
64.4±11.2%, p<0.01) and tHb (+1.7±0.01 vs -2.6±0.01,
p<0.05) decreased significantly; during P3 TOI
decreased further initially (63.4±9.3) and recovered
partially at the end (66.4±10.3).
Conclusions: Our results show that, for cerebral
haemodynamics, the most critical phase of surgical
repair of CDH is the closure of the diaphragmatic
defect, when the compression of the inferior vena cava
is more marked and could impair venous return.
EXTERNAL VENTRICULAR DRAINAGE WITH
TEFLON SCREW FOR TREATMENT OF
RAPIDLY PROGRESSIVE POSTHEMORRAGIC
HYDROCEPHALUS IN PREMATURE NEWBORN

Dipartimento di Anestesia e Rianimazione Pediatrica,
Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy
Background and Aims: Thirteen premature newborn,
birthweight 1250g (745-1965) with rapidly progressive
posthemorragic hydrocephalus were treated by external
ventricular drainage with teflon screw. Seven patients
suffered from intra ventricular hemorrage grade 3 and
six grade 4.
Methods: The drainage was placed at day 8,4+/-2 after
intra ventricular hemorrage occurred and was kept in
place 33,4+/- 6 days, the longest period being 46 days.
Monitoring of intracranial pressure was performed while
the drainage was in place.
Results: One of thirteen patients died for causes
unrelated to external ventricular hemorrage. Twelve
patiens survived. In 3 of 12 surviving patients
progressive posthemorragic hydrocephalus recurred
after removal of the drainage and required definitive
shunt implantation. For the remaining 9 patients no
further therapy was necessary. Bacterial cultures from
cerebro spinal fluid were negative in 11 patients and
positive in 2 patients. No chemical or biochemical
evidence of ventriculitis was noted. In 3 patients
neurological development was classified as normal, 8
patients experienced mild or moderate paresis and
development delay; one patient was severely retarded.
Visual deficits were absent in 7 patients, in one patient
total blindness was present and in 4 patients strabismus.
Conclusions: This study reports a 25% incidence of
hydrocephalus recurrence and definitive shunt
implantation. Precoucious drainage, monitoring of
intracranial pressure, daily cerebral echograpy and
cerebro spinal fluid protein less than 100mg/dl before
external ventricular drainage removal are probably
useful means to achieve a low rate of definitive shunt
implantation.
EFFECTIVENESS OF A BRIEF COURSE IN
INTERPRETING AMPLITUDE INTEGRATED
ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAMS IN TERM
NEWBORN

E Vasconcellos
Miami Children's Hospital, Miami, FL, USA
Background and Aims: Routine monitoring and
interpretation of newborn brain activity using
conventional electroencephalogram (EEG) in Neonatal
Intensive Care Units (NICUs) is difficult. Amplitude-
integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) technology
may help NICU personnel evaluate neonatal brain
activity in a rapid, non-invasive, and cost-effective
manner. Whether NICU personnel could learn to
recognize patterns of aEEG/EEG tracings in term
newborns after a brief introductory training.
Methods: Eleven physicians and twenty seven nurses
without training in brain monitoring interpretation
participated in a pre-test, a brief interactive training
course to interpreter neonatal aEEG/EEG patterns, and a
follow-up post-course test to interpret these tracings.
Twenty five tracings of normal function, brain injury,
seizures, and artifacts obtained from a 2 channel
aEEG/EEG 'Brain Z monitor' were shown to
participants. Twelve questions were given pre and post
training. Answers were blindly scored. Chi-square was
used for statistical analysis.
Results: Four hundred fifty six answers were analyzed.
We found significant improvement in correct
interpretations of aEEG/EEG monitor tracings between
the pre and post test respectively: Normal tracing 10/38
vs. 38/38 (p<0.001); bilateral brain injury 1/38 vs. 37/38
(p<0.001); unilateral brain injury 7/38 vs. 34/38
(p<0.001); seizures 1/38 vs. 31/38 (p<0.001); status
epilecticus 1/38 vs. 34/38 (p<0.001); artifact 1/38 vs.
36/38 (p<0.001).
Conclusions: This study shows that a brief instructional
course on interpretation of aEEG/EEG tracings can be
effective in improving NICU personnel's recognition of
normal and abnormal term neonatal brain patterns.

Background and Aims: Neuroradiological pictures and
clinical patterns of two cases of severe neonatal
hypoglycaemia: Case 1. A term male three days old with
- 253 -
poor feeding in the last 12 hours. He showed signs of
dehydration, neurological deterioration and generalized
seizures associated with severe hypoglycaemia and
metabolic acidosis. Case 2: A term male born by
cesarean delivery after an uneventful pregnancy that
presented micropenis, respiratory distress and severe
hypoglycaemia whenever glucose infusion was reduced
or interrupted. Endocrine study revealed multiple
pituitary hormone deficiencies.
Methods: Brain imaging at 1.5 Tesla consists of
saggital T1, axial TSE T2, coronal FLAIR and diffusion.
Case 1: the follow-up MRI included 3D T1 and venous
MRA. Case 2: the sella was evaluated with high
resolution T1 3D.
Results: Case 1: Simetric diffuse effacement of
posterior parieto-occipital sulci was associated with T2
hyperintensity, increased diffusion, and decreased ADC
indicating citotoxic edema. An abnormal deep
parafacine left vein is noted with absent straight sinus
and vein of Galen. Mielination and cortical structures
were normal. The abnormal vein was confirmed on
MRA, draining to a small irregular posterior superior
sagital sinus. The torcula and transverse sinuses were
normal. Case 2: The cerebrum, sulci and mielination
were normal. The sella was small, with ectopic bright
spot in diencephalon and absent pituitary stalk.
Conclusions: There are few reports relating
neuroimaging findings in neonatal hypoglycaemia. We
report two cases of severe neonatal hypoglycaemia
where neuroimaging demostrated significant findings on
MRI.

State Medical University, Tbilisi, Georgia
Background and Aims: Intrauterine infections are one
of the main causes of neonatal and infant morbidity and
mortality. Early diagnostics and appropriate treatment of
these diseases is very important. The aim of the study
was to evaluate the efficacy of brain ultrasound
examination (BUE) for diagnostics of intrauterine
infections.
Methods: We studied 0-3 month’s age 150 children
with diagnosis of sepsis, perinatal encephalopathy,
intracranial hypertension, and prolonged neonatal
jaundice. BUE was conducted for every patient and in
case of special changes that characterized infections
(calzificats, edema, periventricular ishemia, microcysts,
and ventriculomegalia) were studied special Ig M and
IgG by immunofermental assay. The elevation of
specific antibodies more then 4 times in second analyzes
comparing to first one was considered as diagnostic
criteria of intrauterine infections.
Results: The results of the study showed that 32 patients
(36%) had the changes, that characterized infections and
in all these patients the ethnologic factors of intrauterine
infections (cytomegalovirus, herpes, toxoplazma,
chlamidia) by immuno-fermental assay were discovered.
In the Control group the patients with no changes of the
BUE intrauterine infections were diagnosed only in 3
cases (chlamidia, herpes).
Conclusions: We conclude that BUE is cost-effective
method for early diagnostic of the intrauterine
infections.
THE CONTRIBUTION OF NEUROIMAGING IN
NEONATAL PATHOLOGY
G C Zaharie
Department of Neonatology, University of Medicine and
Pharmacy 'Iuliu Hatieganu', Cluj-Napoca, Romania
Background and Aims: The investigation want to re-
evaluate neuroimaging in newborn infants with neonatal
hypoxic pathology.
Methods: Complete neurologic examination, EEG,
transfontanellar ultrasonography, CT or MRI were
carried out in 8 newborns with severe neonatal asphixia
10 days after birth and at the age of 3 months.
Results: MRI was performed at the age of 10 days in 5
newborns with neurologic syndrome since the first day
of life, revealing various aspects of cerebral ischemia.
At the age of 3 months, in three of these, the neurologic
examination revealed spastic paraplegia, MRI detecting
marked brain atrophy. In one case with normal
neurologic examination, EEG and MRI were within
normal range at the age of 10 days, at 3 months changes
in the neurologic picture were noted, with the
occurrence of spastic paraplegia, changes in the EEG,
the MRI aspect remaining normal. In one case with
neonatal asphixia and DIC, the neurologic examination
and EEG were within normal range, with multiple
superficial and deep hemorrhagic foci at MRI, and at the
age of 3 months the neurologic examination and EEG
being normal and MRI much improved. Cerebral
hemorrhage degree IV with secondary hydrocephalia
was diagnosed in 2 premature infants aged 29 and 30
weeks respectively, with improvements in the CT after
performing ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. Cerebral
malformations were diagnosed based on the MRI and
CT performed.
Conclusions: MRI correlated with the neurologic
picture in 87.5% of the cases. Neuroimaging is a marker
of the course of cerebral distress.
SENSORIAL SATURATION FOR NEONATAL
ANALGESIA

Departments of Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Reproduction
Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy
Background and Aims: Sensorial Saturation is a
procedure in which touch, massage, taste, voice, smell
and sight compete with pain, producing almost complete
analgesia during heelprick in neonates. SS is an
apparently complex manoeuvre, but when correctly
explained it is easily learnt. In the present paper we
studied its feasibility, assessing whether a long training
is really needed to achieve good results.
Methods: We enrolled 66 consecutive babies and
divided them randomly into three groups which received
- 254 -
the following forms of analgesia: glucose plus sucking
(A), sensorial saturation performed by nurses (B);
sensorial saturation performed by mothers (C). We did
not use perfume on the caregivers’ hands, so that babies
could smell the natural scent of the hands. We assessed
pain level by the ABC scale.
Results: Median scores of groups A, B and C were: 1
(0-6), 0 (0-4) and 0 (0-6) respectively. Mean scores
were: 0.6, 0.6 and 1.7 and standard errors were 0.38,
0.22 and 0.32 respectively. Scores of groups B and C
were significantly lower than that of A (p = 0.03 and
0.006 respectively). No significant difference was found
between values of scores of groups B and C.
Conclusions: Even without the use of perfume on the
hands, SS was effective as an analgesic manoeuvre. It
made no difference whether SS was performed by
mothers who applied it for the first time or experienced
nurses: SS is rapid to learn and any caregiver (mother,
pediatrician or nurse) can effectively use it.

Background and Aims: Pregnant women with hyper
pigmented skin or wearing veils are at risk of vitamin D
deficiency. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in
pregnant women and their newborn infants is unknown.
Our aim is to determine the prevalence of vitamin D
deficiency in newborns of mothers at risk in the
Netherlands.
Methods: All pregnant women visiting our outpatient
clinic of the obstetric department between April 2004
and February 2006 were encountered to participate in
our study. The risk group consisted of women with
tinted or dark skin and women wearing veils. The
control group consisted of Caucasian women.
Information was obtained through a questionnaire about
pigmentation of skin, race, sun exposure, dressing
habits, use of vitamins and patient history, including
clinical symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. Blood
samples were collected from the mothers at the end of
third trimester. The umbilical cord blood was tested on
25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3,
alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, calcium and
phosphorus, in 87 newborns. Vitamin D deficiency in
the newborn was defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 < 25
nmol/l.
Results: Of 87 newborn infants 37 were vitamin D
deficient (16% of the newborns of Caucasian mothers,
39% of the newborns of mothers with tinted skin, 44%
of the newborns of mothers with dark skin and 91% of
the newborns of veiled mothers).
Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency is frequently seen in
newborns born to mothers at risk. Clinical implications
of vitamin D deficiency for the newborn infants are
unknown and need further investigation.

Background and Aims: Chorioamnionitis is an
important cause of preterm birth and is associated with
major neurological morbidity. We hypothesised that
chorioamnionitis in preterm infants is associated with
postnatal hypotension, a known etiological factor in the
development of neurological morbidity.
Methods: Over a two-year period all infants born in the
Erasmus MC at 32 weeks gestation were included.
Relevant clinical data and placental histopathology were
obtained from each infant. Blood pressure values were
recorded during the first three postnatal days, clustered
in four-hour periods, and compared between patients
with histological chorioamnionitis (HC) and those
without (non-HC).
Results: 303 Patients were included, 119 (39.3%) of
whom had HC. HC patients had significantly lower
diastolic and mean blood pressures at several time
points during the first three days after birth. The largest
differences were present in the diastolic blood pressure
between 36 and 72 hours. However, patients with HC
had a significantly lower gestational age (28.2 ±2.0
versus 29.6 ±1.7, p<0.001). When blood pressures were
compared after stratification for gestational age no
significant differences were present. There were no
differences in treatment with vasopressors, inotropes or
volume expansion between the two groups. Also, the
incidence of septicemia during the study period was
similar.
Conclusions: After correction for gestational age
differences, there was no association between
histological chorioamnionitis and blood pressure during
the first three postnatal days in preterm infants born at
32 weeks gestation. Thus, low early postnatal blood
pressure values do not seem to explain the increased
incidence of neurological morbidity after
chorioamnionitis in preterm infants.

Background and Aims: Emerging clinical and
experimental evidence indicates a link between small
size at birth and cardiovascular risk in adult life. The
relationship with hypertension remains controversial.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological
day/night variations of blood pressure in two subgroups
of children as a function of the posterior communicating
arteries (PCoAs).
Methods: A total of 26, randomly selected SGA
children participated to the study (age, M SD: 9.45 ±
2.08 yr). A 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
(SpaceLabs 90207) was carried out and the population
was subdivided into 2 groups, based on transcranial
doppler evidence of bilateral non-functioning PcoAs
(PcoA-positive vs. bil-PCoA-negative). Day-to-night
variations in systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean
(MBP) blood pressure were the main outcome measures.
Results: 65.4% children were found to be PcoA-
positive vs. 34.6% bil-PCoA-negative. The groups were
comparable for blood pressure percentiles for age,
gender, gestational age at birth, birth weight SDS, and
auxometric growth (p 0.35). PcoA-positive children
showed significantly reduced day-night variations in
SBP (7.16 4.93% vs. 16.6 5.55%, p= 0.0002), DBP
(14.28 8.92% vs. 24.96 7.62%, p=0.0056) and MBP
(9.84 8.49% vs. 21.2 7.31%, p=0.0024), had a
significantly higher frequency of history of pregnancy-
induced hypertension (p= 0.0144), and their mothers
showed a significantly increased right-side carotid
intima-media thickness (p=0.0277), as compared to the
bil-PcoA-negative population.
Conclusions: Our data suggest the existence of two
phenotypically distinct SGA children populations, at
possibly different risk of developing hypertension in
adult life.

Background and Aims: An acute thymic involution in
human fetuses and newborns has been described in
very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants with histological
chorioamnionitis. However, its underlying mechanisms
remain to be clarified. We tested the hypothesis that an
activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenals (HPA)
axis in VLBW infants with acute thymic involution at
birth.
Methods: 107 VLBW newborns (28.7 ± 3.1 wk
gestation; 1078 ± 292 g) were examined. Thymic size
was measured on standard chest radiographs at birth,
and expressed as the ratio between the transverse
diameter of the cardiothymic image at the level of the
carina (CT) and that of the thorax (T). CT/T< 0.28 was
considered to indicate small thymus. Plasma cortisol
(Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics) and ACTH (DPC
Immunolyte) concentrations were determined on days 1
(d-1) and 7 (d-7), and at 1 month (mo-1).
Results: 32.7% (35/107) of the newborns showed a
CT/T < 0.28. As compared with those with normal
thymic size, infants with small thymus had significantly
increased cortisol on d-1 (~4.5-folds) [median: 19.0
(95% C.I:13.04-37.81) vs. 4.19 (3.21-5.34) g/dL,
p<0.0001)] and d-7 (~1.7-folds) [7.96 (5.73-9.93) vs.
4.48 (2.33-8.17) g/dL, p=0.0293)], together with
higher ACTH concentrations on d-1 (~1.8-folds) [25.6
(15.32-60.58) vs. 14.0 (10.70-18.16) pg/mL, p=
0.0180)]. No significant differences for cortisol at mo-1
(p=0.9485), or ACTH concentrations on d-7 (p=0.6713)
and mo-1 (p=0.5006) were evidenced.
Conclusions: Our data indicated the presence of a
previously unrecognized activation of the HPA axis life
in VLBW newborns with a small thymus at birth.

Background and Aims: Factors present in early life
can increase the risk of asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR),
and atopic dermatitis (AD). The aim of the study was
analysis of the prevalence of wheezing and diagnosis of:
asthma, AR, and AD in 5-7 years old very low
birthweight infants.
Methods: 108 children with mean birthweight 1090g
were evaluated by standardized ISAAC (International
Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood)
questionnaire at the age of 5-7 years. Total IgE level,
specific IgE, lymphocyte Th1/Th2 ratio and skin prick
- 256 -
tests were done. Prevalence of allergic disorders among
VLBW infants was compared to ISAAC regional data.
Results: The prevalence of wheezing ever (47.2 vs
28.6%) and wheezing last year (25 vs 13.6%) were
higher in the VLBW infants. Number of children with
asthma diagnosis was higher in the VLBW group (23.1
vs 5.8%). The prevalence of AR ever symptoms (34.3 vs
33.6%) and established AR diagnosis (19.4 vs 21.1%)
were similar in both cohorts. The prevalence of AD ever
and AD in the last year was lower in the VLBW group
(16 vs 25,2%, and 5.5 vs 15.3%). Elevated IgE levels
were detected in 31%, positive prick test occurred in
13.6%, and lymphocyte Th1/Th2 ratio<1 in 21.5% of
VLBW infants.
Conclusions: Higher prevalence of wheezing ever,
wheezing last year and diagnosed asthma, along with
similar prevalence of AR and AD in both cohorts
suggest that symptoms of asthma in 5-7 years old
VLBW infants are associated with persistent bronchial
hyperreactivity rather than atopic asthma. (Study

Background and Aims: Very preterm infants are
known to have ongoing health problems after discharge
with respiratory illnesses and neurodevelopmental delay
being common. This study examines the health service
contacts of a representative regional cohort of very
preterm infants to 4 years.
Methods: Between July 1998 and November 2000, 100
preterm babies were recruited and 104 term born control
infants were selected when aged 2. General Practitioner
(GP), hospital outpatient and admissions from discharge
to 4 years were collated and compared.
Results: Complete data was available for 92 very
preterm and 71 controls children. Up to age 2 both
groups had similar rates of GP contacts despite preterm
children having more frequent hospital outpatient visits
(most frequently for neurodevelopmental follow-up) and
hospital admissions, After age 2 the GP visits became
significantly higher in the preterm children (p<0.001).
Respiratory diagnoses were significantly higher in the
very preterm children for admissions and GP visits >2
years. Ophthalmology, otolaryngology and orthopaedics
were the predominant surgical specialties accessed as
outpatients and inpatients particularly after age 2. From
age 2 years hospital admission continued to be
significantly higher in the preterm (p<0.001).
Conclusions: Babies born very preterm have more
frequent GP and outpatient visits and hospital
admissions up to age 4 years. Compared to age <2,
respiratory illnesses have reduced as reason for hospital
admissions but increased as reason for GP visits in the
preterm group. Surgical specialties were used more
frequently at age 2-3 years. These findings confirm the
high health utilisation of very preterm infants to age 4.

Background and Aims: There is conflicting evidence
on the effect of prenatal betamethasone administration
on renal drug clearance [1,2]. We therefore wanted to
document and quantify the impact of betamethasone
administration on vancomycin in the first month of life.
Methods: Population pharmacokinetics of vancomycin
in neonates were estimated in a cohort of 214 premature
neonates (24-34 weeks) with a postnatal age of 11.9
(1-27) days. Covariate analysis included weight,
postmenstrual age (PMA), serum creatinine, use of
inotropes, positive blood culture, use of respiratory
support, administration of ibuprofen as well as maternal
betamethasone administration.
Results: A one-compartment linear disposition model
with zero order input and first order elimination was
used to describe data on 604 observations. Clearance
increased from 0.897 L/h/70kg at 24 weeks PMA to
2.02 L/h/70kg by 34 weeks. Between subject variability
was 18.6%, between occasion variability 12.2%. The
use of ibuprofen reduced clearance (18%). Overall 82%
of the variability was predictable. Size explained 49%,
PMA 18% and renal function 34%. There was no effect
of betamethasone on vancomycin clearance.
Conclusions: Size, renal function and postmenstrual age
are the major contributors to clearance variability in
premature neonates. Prenatal betamethasone
administration had no independent effect on
vancomycin clearance in the first month of postnatal
life. [1] Van den Anker JN et al. Ped Research

Background and Aims: There is evidence that IUGR
fetuses alter in utero nutrient metabolism in order to
survive their environment, and this fetal adaptation is
associated with long term health disorders. The ability to
identify a population of IUGR neonates who
demonstrate abnormal protein metabolism would enable
an investigation of infant feeding strategies that could
ameliorate long-term adverse health outcomes.
Methods: The goal of this study was to determine if
preterm infants with definitive IUGR demonstrate
abnormal postnatal nitrogen metabolism in the
immediate postnatal period when compared to AGA
infants of comparable gestational age. All infants
received exclusive parenteral nutrition. IUGR infants
were pair matched with AGA controls for the following
parameters by order of importance to the study outcome:
protein intake, gestational age, hours of age at study,
energy intake. The primary outcome variable was
protein balance as determined by the nitrogen balance
method.
Results: Data from 16 IUGR/AGA pairs are shown in
the table. Analysis by paired t-test, though mean + SEM
data is presented; p<0.05 considered significant.
Conclusions: Although this study was not able to detect
differences in estimated protein accretion rates in IUGR
vs AGA preterm neonates, these differences may exist,
and studies using different experimental strategies may
be able to define these differences.
PERINATAL FACTORS INFLUENCING LATER
GROWTH OUTCOME IN VERY PRETERM
INFANTS

C Romagnoli
NICU, Catholic University, Rome, Italy
Background and Aims: Poor growth during the early
years is well documented in children born prematurely
but the relation between perinatal morbidity and
subsequent growth retardation is poorly understood. Our
aim was to determine, in children born AGA at GA 30
weeks, the main perinatal factors predictive of growth
patterns at corrected age of 36 months.
Methods: The growth outcome of 133 infants (GA
27.8±1.5 wks, BW 1017±208 g) discharged from our
NICU between 1996 and 2002 was assessed at 36
months of corrected age. Poor growth was defined as a
Zs. <-1.28.
Results: At 36 months of age the children were slightly
smaller on average in the three growth measures: Z
scores were -1.02±1.29 for Weight, -0.90±1.09 for
Height and -0.72±1.07 for Head Circumference; 45.9%
of children had poor growth in W, 34.6% in H and
30.3% in HC. During hospitalization weight growth
retarded children showed higher CRIB score (3.7 vs 2.6;
p <0.05), more days of oxygen therapy (40.4 vs 25.1; p
<0.05) and a greater Zs fall between birth and discharge
(-1.06 vs -0.81; p<0.05). Multiple logistic analysis
identified ZsW change between birth and discharge (OR
0.44; Ic95% 0.24,0.81), male gender (OR 0.11; Ic95%
0.05,0.53) and ZsW at birth (OR 0.08; Ic95% 0.01,0.65)
as the best predictors for poor later growth. A similar
model was predictive for H and HC poor growth.
Conclusions: In very premature infants growth during
early postnatal period could predict the growth
retardation at 3 years of corrected age.

Background and Aims: The aim of the study was
estimation of the leptin level in the umbilical cord blood
in newborns in connection to their gestational age,
gender and somatic parameters.
Methods: A cohort of 301 newborns born between
01.01.04 - 30.06.05 in Neonatal Dept. Medical
University of Gda sk was examined. Antropometric
measurements were taken. Samples of the umbilical
cord blood were collected after birth and leptin
concentration was analysed by standard RIA method.
Results: We stated significantly lower leptin level in
prematures (6,88 + 6,49 ng/ml) comparing to mature
children (13,8 + 9,81 ng/ml) (p<0,01). Taking birth
weight into account as a nutritional state criterium we
affirm that the lowest leptin concentration was observed
in < 3000 g group (8, 41 + 6,07 ng/ml). The
significantly highest level (p<0,01) was observed in
> 4000 g group (20,52 + 12,83 ng/ml). Significantly
higher (p<0,05) leptin level was observed in female
children (14,9 + 9,4 ng/ml vs 12,6 + 10,13 ng/ml). There
were no differences in P.I. between premature and
mature newborns. P.I. was significantly higher in male
newborns. In the age of 6 and 12 months 86% of
newborns with birth weight > 90 percentile were still
characterized by the same > 90 body mass percentile.
Conclusions: Both the small and the large birth weight
are connected with similarly low and high leptinaemia.
According to ' fetal programming' theory large birth
weight causes higher probability of patophysiological
(especially obesity) disturbances. The risk of diabetes in
future is also more often in these children.

Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece
Background and Aims: The risks and benefits of
prophylactic iron supplementation in pregnant women
who are not iron deficient remains a source of
controversy. Elevated iron stores during pregnancy have
recently been linked to maternal complications and
perinatal risks to their offspring (Scholl 2005, Viteri
2005). The aim of this study was to determine if there is
an association between maternal iron status, under
prophylactic iron supplementation, and perinatal-
neonatal outcomes.
Methods: Full blood count and serum ferritin
concentrations were measured at delivery in 42 high risk
neonates (IUGR, IDM, prematures) (group A), and 29
healthy term neonates (group B) and their mothers.
Serum soluble transferin receptor (TfR) was measured at
birth in all neonates. Each group was divided in 3
subgroups according to mothers’ ferritin levels.
Results: Iron repleted mothers were found only in group
A. The incidence of gestational diabetes (GD) and/or
IUGR was higher (p<0.04) in mothers with high
ferritine levels ( g/l) (table). Ferritin concentration was
significantly lower in mothers compared to their
neonates (p<0.0001). High risk neonates (group A) had
lower ferritin levels compared to healthy term neonates
(p<0.0005). Neonatal TfR levels (mg/L) were higher in
group A compared to group B (p<0.05).
Conclusions: Elevated iron stores during pregnancy
might predispose to GD and IUGR. Maternal iron
deficiency does not affect iron status in the neonate. In
high risk neonates iron stores are lower than in term
neonates.

Background and Aims: Low neonatal plasma cortisol
is associated with morbidity in very preterm infants.
Later, other studies show increased salivary cortisol
responses in such infants, and children born preterm are
at risk for higher blood pressure. The aim was to
investigate salivary cortisol responses and blood
pressure in adolescents born preterm before and after
MRI, a potentially stressful situation.
Methods: Forty-nine adolescents, age 12-17 years, born
preterm (birth weight < 1500g) and 43 controls born at
term, age 12-16 years. Salivary cortisol was measured
before and after MRI. Subjects also answered a
validated questionnaire, including 12 items, about
perceived stress. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures
were measured before MRI.
Results: Before MRI median (range) salivary cortisol
was 4.6 nmol/L (1.2-39) in the preterm group and 3.7
nmol/L (0.8-192) in controls (p=0.87), and after MRI
2.9 nmol/L (0.8-30) and 3.5 nmol/L (1.0-186,
respectively (p=0.68). Most children expressed little
stress in relation to the MRI, the preterm group scored
lower for feeling of pressure before (p=0.04), but also
expressed feelings of less energy after the MRI
(p=0.028). There were no differences between the
groups in blood pressure in this study population. There
were no gender differences in salivary cortisol or blood
pressure, but in boys born preterm pre-MRI salivary
cortisol and systolic blood pressure correlated (rs=0.6,
p<0.004).
Conclusions: This study did not find significant
differences in stress responses between adolescents born
preterm (BW<1500 g) and controls born at term.

Background and Aims: According to the 'fetal origin
of adult disease' hypothesis, intrauterine growth
restriction (IUGR) is associated with later
hypercholesterolemia and occurrence of the metabolic
syndrome. This study aimed to investigate lipid status
during intrauterine and early postnatal life in 20 IUGR
(birth weight below the 10th customized centile) and 20
appropriate for gestational age (AGA) fetuses (UC), and
newborns on days 1 (N1) and 4 (N4), and to assess the
ratio of total cholesterol levels to the ponderal index
[PI= weight(kg)/height(m)³], which is an anthropometric
method, used to diagnose impaired fetal growth.
Methods: Total cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride levels
were measured by an automatic clinical chemistry
analyzer (ADVIA 1650, Bayer Diagnostics, Tarrytown,
NY, USA). LDL was determined by using the
Friedewald equation.
Results: Absolute total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and
triglyceride levels were similar in both groups at all time
points studied (UC, N1 and N4). The ratio of total
cholesterol to PI was significantly increased in IUGR
versus AGA fetuses (2.94+/-0.87 versus 2.46+/-0.49.,
p=0.042) and neonates on day 1 (3.06+/-0.83 versus
2.58+/-0.54, p=0.039).
Conclusions: Although lipid levels do not differ
between both groups, total cholesterol to ponderal index
ratio is increased in IUGR versus AGA fetuses and
newborns. This finding possibly indicates existence of
hypercholesterolemia and impaired fetal liver function,
- 259 -
evident from the early postnatal life and due to the
adverse intrauterine environment. Thus, the 'fetal origin
of adult disease' hypothesis is reinforced.

Background and Aims: The clinical spectra of infants
of diabetic mothers (IDMs) encountered in the past 20
years were retrospectively analyzed to clarify the
prognosis.
Methods: IDMs were divided into three groups
according to years born. Group 1 consists of 166 infants
born from 1984 to 1989, Group 2 of 192 infants from
1994 to 1997, and Group 3 of 173 infants from 2000 to
2003. The frequencies of complications such as heavy
for dates, prematurity, asphyxia, hypoglycemia,
polycythemia, hypocalcemia, hyperbilirubinemia,
congenital malformations, respiratory dysfunctions, and
myocardial hypertrophy were determined. Mortality rate
were also evaluated.
Results: During the study period 754 (12.5%) IDMs
were born out of 6042 births. Major congenital
malformations were observed in 3.8% infants including
1.5% cardiac anomalies. Each one case of VACTER
association and caudal regression syndrome were born
from untreated mothers during early pregnancy. Two
infants died due to VACTER association and extreme
prematurity. The rates of all complications in Group 2
were lower than Group 1, but they reascended in Group
3, which included highest frequency of the mothers
complicated with retinopathy and/or nephropathy
(12.7% (22/173)). Among 22 pregnancies, 15 were
terminated prematurely for the treatment of mothers,
and eventually 6 of them were born <1500g.
Conclusions: Even under the tight control at our special
Diabetes Center, the incidences of complications in
IDMs from mothers untreated at the beginning of
pregnancy were not low enough. We emphasize further
improvements in health education and treatment for
diabetic women before and during pregnancy.

Background and Aims: To assess the differences in
weight gain during hospitalization in premature
newborn.
Methods: Design: retrospective comparison from 1990
to 2004, in three year periods. Population: newborn 32
week of gestation or less, born within the hospital.
Exclusion criteria: death during hospitalization, major
congenital malformation, transfer to other centres and
hospitalization of less than 14 days. Study variables:
date of birth, birth and discharge weight and respective z
score (Z1 and Z2), gestation, number of foetuses, sex,
CRIB score, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing
enterocolitis, postnatal corticoids treatment, diuretic
treatment, hospital stay and mortality.
Results: A total of 1192 premature were included and
552 excluded. Comparing the five three-years periods,
there were not differences in Z1, sex distribution, CRIB
and hospital stay. Mortality decreased and
bronchopulmonary dysplasia increased from 1990 to
1995, with no significant changes from 1996 to 2004.
Daily weight gain and z difference (Z2 - Z1) were worse
during 1996-98 period (14.2 g/day and -1.74
respectively) and better during 2002-04 (16.74 g/day
and -1,33 respectively), (p < 0.001). These differences
were also significant in all birth weight and gestational
groups. Postnatal treatment with corticoids was 14.6%
during 1996-98 period and 0.3% during 2001-04
(p<0.001), and diuretics treatment 23.4% and 12.6%
respectively (p<0.001).
Conclusions: Medical practices influence weight gain
during hospitalization. An 24% improvement on z score
difference (Z2 - Z1), comparing 1996-98 and 2002-04
periods, is coincidental with a dramatic decrease in
corticoids and diuretics postnatal treatments, and
probably, with less liquids restriction.

Background and Aims: The aim of this study was to
determine if the degree of the placental insufficiency is
associated with intestinal dysfunction and if this affects
infants growth and length of hospital stay.
Methods: All infants between 30- 34 weeks Gestation
Age (wGA), were divided into two groups based on the
results of Doppler studies. Patients with documented
normal +/- 2 SD Pulsatility Index (PI) in arteries
umbilicalis were allocated to Group I while patients
with PI> +2 SD were in Group II.
Results: A total of 56 infants were identified. Four had
lethal malformation and were excluded. Eleven patients
had inconclusive Pulsatily Index (PI). 33 patients had
PI±2 SD (Group I) and eight Group II (PI > +2SD). All
infants received mothers own milk or bank milk from
day one.
Conclusions: We found correlation between placental
insufficiency and postnatal intestinal dysfunction in
premature infants. Neonates with Pulsatility Index > +2

controversy. Elevated iron stores during pregnancy have
recently been linked to maternal complications and
perinatal risks to their offspring (Scholl 2005, Viteri
2005). The aim of this study was to determine if there is
an association between maternal iron status, under
prophylactic iron supplementation, and perinatal-
neonatal outcomes.
Methods: Full blood count and serum ferritin
concentrations were measured at delivery in 42 high risk
neonates (IUGR, IDM, prematures) (group A), and 29
healthy term neonates (group B) and their mothers.
Serum soluble transferin receptor (TfR) was measured at
birth in all neonates. Each group was divided in 3
subgroups according to mothers’ ferritin levels.
Results: Iron repleted mothers were found only in group
A. The incidence of gestational diabetes (GD) and/or
IUGR was higher (p<0.04) in mothers with high
ferritine levels ( g/l) (table). Ferritin concentration was
significantly lower in mothers compared to their
neonates (p<0.0001). High risk neonates (group A) had
lower ferritin levels compared to healthy term neonates
(p<0.0005). Neonatal TfR levels (mg/L) were higher in
group A compared to group B (p<0.05).
Conclusions: Elevated iron stores during pregnancy
might predispose to GD and IUGR. Maternal iron
deficiency does not affect iron status in the neonate. In
high risk neonates iron stores are lower than in term
neonates.

Background and Aims: Low neonatal plasma cortisol
is associated with morbidity in very preterm infants.
Later, other studies show increased salivary cortisol
responses in such infants, and children born preterm are
at risk for higher blood pressure. The aim was to
investigate salivary cortisol responses and blood
pressure in adolescents born preterm before and after
MRI, a potentially stressful situation.
Methods: Forty-nine adolescents, age 12-17 years, born
preterm (birth weight < 1500g) and 43 controls born at
term, age 12-16 years. Salivary cortisol was measured
before and after MRI. Subjects also answered a
validated questionnaire, including 12 items, about
perceived stress. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures
were measured before MRI.
Results: Before MRI median (range) salivary cortisol
was 4.6 nmol/L (1.2-39) in the preterm group and 3.7
nmol/L (0.8-192) in controls (p=0.87), and after MRI
2.9 nmol/L (0.8-30) and 3.5 nmol/L (1.0-186,
respectively (p=0.68). Most children expressed little
stress in relation to the MRI, the preterm group scored
lower for feeling of pressure before (p=0.04), but also
expressed feelings of less energy after the MRI
(p=0.028). There were no differences between the
groups in blood pressure in this study population. There
were no gender differences in salivary cortisol or blood
pressure, but in boys born preterm pre-MRI salivary
cortisol and systolic blood pressure correlated (rs=0.6,
p<0.004).
Conclusions: This study did not find significant
differences in stress responses between adolescents born
preterm (BW<1500 g) and controls born at term.

Background and Aims: According to the 'fetal origin
of adult disease' hypothesis, intrauterine growth
restriction (IUGR) is associated with later
hypercholesterolemia and occurrence of the metabolic
syndrome. This study aimed to investigate lipid status
during intrauterine and early postnatal life in 20 IUGR
(birth weight below the 10th customized centile) and 20
appropriate for gestational age (AGA) fetuses (UC), and
newborns on days 1 (N1) and 4 (N4), and to assess the
ratio of total cholesterol levels to the ponderal index
[PI= weight(kg)/height(m)³], which is an anthropometric
method, used to diagnose impaired fetal growth.
Methods: Total cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride levels
were measured by an automatic clinical chemistry
analyzer (ADVIA 1650, Bayer Diagnostics, Tarrytown,
NY, USA). LDL was determined by using the
Friedewald equation.
Results: Absolute total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and
triglyceride levels were similar in both groups at all time
points studied (UC, N1 and N4). The ratio of total
cholesterol to PI was significantly increased in IUGR
versus AGA fetuses (2.94+/-0.87 versus 2.46+/-0.49.,
p=0.042) and neonates on day 1 (3.06+/-0.83 versus
2.58+/-0.54, p=0.039).
Conclusions: Although lipid levels do not differ
between both groups, total cholesterol to ponderal index
ratio is increased in IUGR versus AGA fetuses and
newborns. This finding possibly indicates existence of
hypercholesterolemia and impaired fetal liver function,
- 261 -
age, height, weight, parity, smoking habits and infant
sex. Estimated marginal means are presented in the table
below. Each of the 7 sub-domains showed similar
associations except for ‘barriers to housing and
services’.
Conclusions: Gestational age and birth weight are
associated with IMD and some, but not all of its sub-
domains. Studies evaluating perinatal outcome could use
IMD to take account of specific patterns of deprivation.

Background and Aims: Multiple pregnancies, both
spontaneous and iatrogenic, are an important component
of VLBWI incidence. Our aim was to monitor
epidemiology and clinical outcomes of VLBWI from
multiple pregnancies.
Methods: Data from the National Registry of VLBWI
(1996-2004) was used for risk analysis of morbidity and
mortality of VLBWI from multiple pregnancies.
VLBWI singletons were considered as having basal risk.
VLBWI from highest order multiple pregnancies (>4)
were not considered. Analysis of iatrogenic multiple
pregnancies was not a purpose.
Results: Amongst the 8567 registered VLBWI, 2249
(26%) were multiples (1852 twins, 346 triplets, 40
quadruplets and 11 of higher order). Since 2001, the rate
of multiples has been decreasing. Some major outcome
risk indicators, as mortality and HMD, were better for
triplets and quadruples than for singletons and twins. No
difference was proved for less frequent events, such as
surfactant administration, PDA, IVH 3-4, NEC II-III or
NEC-related surgery. Perinatal risk factors were
consistently less severe among triplets and quadruples
than singletons and twins: absence of prenatal care,
absence of prenatal steroids, iatrogenic prematurity,
CRIB, NTISS, gestational age, and birth weight. Level
of neonatal care was similar whichever the number of
foetuses was.
Conclusions: During this period, the improved prenatal
and perinatal care of VLBWI from higher order multiple
pregnancies was associated to lower than expected
mortality and morbidity risks (even lower than single
pregnancies). The role of assisted reproduction
techniques can not be analysed from these database.
Optimal prenatal and perinatal care should be achieved
on every pregnancy, despite the number of foetuses.

Background and Aims: The aim of the present study
was to evaluate the short-term clinical outcomes of
NIDCAP® as compared to conventional care (CC).
Methods: A prospective phase lag cohort study
performed in a tertiary level NICU in the Netherlands.
Infants born before 30 weeks of gestational age were
included, 26 infants in the CC group and 25 infants in
the NIDCAP® group. Primary outcome of the study was
length of NICU stay.
Results: In the CC group mean days of NICU stay was
38 days (SD 25, range 9-99), in the NIDCAP group this
was 49 days (SD 28, range 13-123) (p=0.131). Birth
weight, gestational age, and pneumonia were
statistically significant independent determinants of
length of NICU stay; they explained 55% of variation.
No difference in days of mechanical ventilation was
seen. The NIDCAP group had significantly more days
of respiratory support: median (IQR) days: 53 (32.5-
90.0) versus 22 (10.5-62.8) (p=0.021). After adjustment
in a multivariate regression model for the significant
differences between both groups no difference in days
of respiratory support were seen anymore. Cranial
ultrasound findings differed significantly: in the
NIDCAP group only one infant with severely abnormal
findings, in the CC group 7 infants (plus 2 deceased,
treatment withdrawn due to severe neurological
condition) had severely abnormal findings (p=0.054).
Conclusions: The results of the present study provide
no evidence for a beneficial effect of NIDCAP® care on
length of NICU stay, respiratory support, feeding
progress and growth. A possible beneficial effect was
seen with respect to cranial ultra sound findings.
IMPACT OF DELIVERY ROOM
CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION (DR-
CPR) ON AGE AT THE TIME OF DEATH (LOS)
IN INFANTS<1,200G (ELBW)
A Castillo, R Deulofeut, A Sola
Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA
Background and Aims: Delayed mortality may be
associated with prolonged suffering and also with
emotional, economic and resource costs. The influence
on this variability of DR-CPR has not been investigated.
The objective was to analyze if the LOS in ELBW is
different in those who received DR-CPR compared to
those who died but did not require DR-CPR.
Methods: Analysis of all ELBW who died and had been
born at two Emory perinatal centers in the last 5 years.
- 262 -
Exclusion criteria were major congenital malformations
and provision of comfort care. DR-CPR was defined as
chest compression and/or epinephrine use in the delivery
room (DR).
Results: 87 infants met enrollment criteria; 26 of them
(30%) received DR-CPR. 25% died in first day (d); 18%
at 1-3d; 5% between 4-7d; 29% between 8-28d and
23%>28d of age. The DR-CPR group was similar to the
no DR-CPR group in birth weight [726±160vs.731±176]
and gestational age [24.8±1.9vs.25.3±2.2]. The average
LOS was widely variable, [21.8±47 vs.
30.7±56.9;p=0.669]. Death in the DR [27% vs.
0%;p=0.000], in the first 12 hours of life [38% vs.
7%;p=0.001] and in the first d (42% vs. 20%;p=0.047)
was more frequent in DR-CPR group. Death after 28d
was 11.5% in DR-CPRvs.26.6% in no DR-CPR infants
(p=0.2); and the median LOS was 156.00dvs 41.00d,
respectively.
Conclusions: A large proportion of the infants <1,200g
who die do so after a prolonged LOS. Exposure to DR-
CPR is associated with a higher proportion of early
mortality. Infants exposed to DR-CPR who survive>28d
die after a prolonged LOS. It remains to be determined
if criteria can be identified to avoid delaying the
inevitable.
NASOGASTRIC TUBE POSITION IN NICU
CHILDREN
J de Boer, B J Smit
Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology,
Erasmus MC - Sophia, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: In the NICU, nasogastric tube
placement is an essential procedure that is considered
relatively safe. In adult patients however, tube
placement errors are common, with tubes being
positioned in the esophagus, the intestines, and the
respiratory tract. Incidentally even perforations into the
pleural space are mentioned. Errors may occur both
during insertion and due to migration over time. In
neonates only few studies on tube placement were
performed. Improper positions were mentioned in 38%
to 55% of cases (Weibley et al., 1987). With regard to
patient safety, these are alarming numbers. To establish
the validity of these figures for our own NICU, we
conducted a retrospective study of tube position on
X-rays in a one-year patient cohort.
Methods: The first available X-ray from all NICU
patients with visible nasogastric tube position admitted
through 2005 was reviewed. Trained medical students
categorized them according to previously set decision
rules as ‘correct’, ‘incorrect’ or ‘sub-optimal’ (in the
stomach but excessively long).
Results: Until now, 99 X-rays were classified (± 30% of
the patient cohort). Kappa was .68, indicating
substantial inter-rater agreement. Correct placement was
concluded in 32%, incorrect placement in 19%, and sub-
optimal placement in 32% of cases.
Conclusions: As misplacement appears to be a relevant
problem in our NICU, this study will be continued.
Proper standardized methods for placement and
checking the position of nasogastric tubes should be
developed and refined to improve patient safety.
SHOULD VERY PRETERM BABIES BE GIVEN
HYDROCORTISONE AT BIRTH?
M Watkinson, C Rose
Neonatal Unit, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital,
Birmingham, UK
Background and Aims: To measure the incidence of
early (first 24 hours of life) hypotension in very preterm
(< 27 weeks) infants. To review hydrocortisone in its
treatment.
Methods: An analysis of hypotension in 52 babies,
median (range) gestation 25 (23-26) weeks.
Hypotension was defined as a mean blood pressure
(mmHg) less than the gestation (weeks).
Results: 32 (62%) were hypotensive. 22 received fluid
aliquots of 10 ml/kg. All of these also had dopamine, 12
dobutamine and 5 norepinephrine. Those receiving
norepinephrine were already on > 20 g/kg/min of
dobutamine, and dobutamine was started only after the
dopamine reached > 20 g/kg/min. 13 of the 21,
including all who had dobutamine and norepinephrine,
received hydrocortisone. Of the 10 hypotensive babies
who did not receive a fluid bolus all received dopamine,
two had hydrocortisone. Overall 15 (29%) of the babies
received hydrocortisone at 2.5mg/kg 6 hourly.19 (59%)
of the hypotensive babies died, compared to 4 (20%) of
20 non-hypotensive babies – (difference = 39%; 95% CI
16,50%).
Conclusions: Early hypotension was associated with a
significantly higher mortality. Hydrocortisone is an
effective treatment for neonatal hypotension but it takes
some hours to work, and we gave it late in the therapy
sequence. Nearly a third of the babies received it. Would
its administration during resuscitation reduce the
incidence of early hypotension in the very preterm
infant? The potential risks of hydrocortisone given in
this way are undefined. There is therefore equipoise that
would justify a RCT of hydrocortisone at birth of very
preterm babies.
SURVIVAL AT THE LIMITS OF VIABILITY -
PREDICTIVE VALUE THE APGAR SCORE AT
MINUTE 1
O Genzel-Boroviczeny, J Hempelman
Department of Neonatology, University Childrens
Hospital LMU, Munich, Germany
Background and Aims: Is an APGAR 1 at minute 1
predictive for survival of extremely premature infants,
who have been actively resuscitated and admitted to an
neonatal intensive care unit?
Methods: Chart review of all infants with gestational
ages (GA) < 27 completed weeks over a 5 year period.
Values as median [95% CI].
Results: Of the 237 infants, 29 had APGAR scores 1at
minute (G1) and 208 > 1 (G2). There was no sig.
difference in delivery modus, but infants in G1 were
intubated more frequently (93% vs 77%, p=0,04) and
earlier (2 minutes [2,3; 6,7] vs 5 min [7,5; 10]). Despite
earlier intervention mortality was sig. higher in G1 (62%
vs 17%; p<0,0001), but age at death did not differ (G1:
3,5 d [1;30] vs. G2: 6 d [6;44]. There was a small but
sig. difference in GA (24 wks [23,9;24,7] vs 25 wks
- 263 -
[24,7;25,0] p=0,008) and birthweight (617g [579;678]
vs 700 g [694; 752] p=0,02) Subgroup analysis of
survivors (n=11) and non-survivors (n=18) of the G1
infants revealed birth weight and sex as the best
predictors of survival. With an APGAR 1 at the first
minute a male infant with GA 23 weeks and BW 500 g
has a mortality rate of 92%.
Conclusions: Despite successful resuscitation, infants at
the limits of viability have a very poor prognosis for
survival when presenting with bradycardia, cyanosis and
no respiratory efforts (APGAR=1) at birth. This
information may be helpful for prenatal counseling and
for the decision making in the delivery room.
TWIN TRANSFUSION SYNDROME CAUSING
CUTANEOUS ERYTHROPOIESIS
F Duque, J Campos, R Henriques
Neonatology Unit, Maternidade Daniel de Matos,
Coimbra’s University Hospital, Coimbra, Portugal
Background and Aims: In the newborn infant, the most
common cause of blueberry muffin skin lesions is
cutaneous erythropoiesis, due to intrauterine viral
infection. Also have been described in congenital
leukaemia and neuroblastoma, and rarely reported in
twin transfusion syndrome.
Methods: We report a case of female twins born to a
38-year-old blood type O, Rh-positive mother, by
caesarean section, at 33 weeks of a monochorial
gestation. Maternal rubella and cytomegalovirus titers
indicated immunity at two weeks of gestation.
Pregnancy was not complicated by known viral
exposures, maternal illness or rashes.
Results: Twin A, who weighed 1.965 g was noted to be
plethoric. Twin B, a 1.250 g newborn, was extremely
pale, had hepatomegaly and bluish-red papular skin
lesions, with 3-6 mm in diameter, distributed over the
face, trunk and limbs. She was intubated and ventilated.
Initial laboratory evaluation showed a hematocrit of
13.7% and haemoglobin 4.0 g/dl (twin A hematocrit was
73.1% and haemoglobin 24.6 g/dl), WBC count was
16.900/ l and the platelet count was 85.000/ l. The
patient received a transfusion of packed RBCs. She had
congestive heart failure treated with inotropics and
metabolic acidosis. Cytomegalovirus and syphilis
serologic testing were negative. She had a favourable
clinical evolution, remained well after discharge and
spontaneous resolution of the cutaneous eruption
occurred.
Conclusions: Cutaneous erythropoiesis in this case of
twin transfusion syndrome is considered to be due to
persistence or reactivation of fetal dermal erythropoies,
secondary to prolonged severe intrauterine anemia.

Background and Aims: Antibiotic therapy is
frequently initiated at birth, because the is no rapid and
reliable diagnostic test for identifying the infected
neonates. To determine prospectively the negative
predictive value of simultaneous measurement of 6
cytokines for diagnosing early onset neonatal infection
(EONI).
Methods: Neonates were included if they required
biological and bacteriological evaluation for a
presumptive diagnosis of EONI within 6 hours of life.
After parental consent, a simultaneous measurement of
6 cytokines (IL-1 , IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF )
was performed using the Cytometry Bead Array (CBA)
technique. Exhaustive data were collected from the
medical record of each neonate to allow classification in
3 diagnostic categories (definite, probable, excluded).
Results: Neonates were included if they required
biological and bacteriological evaluation for a
presumptive diagnosis of EONI within 6 hours of life.
After parental consent, a simultaneaus measurement of 6
cytokines (IL-1 , IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF )
was performed using the Cytometry Bead Array (CBA)

medical record of each neonate to allow classification in
3 diagnostic categories (definite, probable, excluded.
Conclusions: The measurement of IL-6 and IL-8 levels,
using the CBA technique, should be effective in
reducing unnecessary antibiotic therapy at birth.

Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Skopje, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Early neonatal sepsis can be
caused by an extraordinary variety of microorganisams.
Early recognition, early diagnosis and treatment is
essential, because the risk of morbidity and mortality
can develop. The aim of our paper is to inform for
incidence of early onset sepsis in our neonatal unit
during last two years.
Methods: The incidence of early onset sepsis was
evaluated by retrospective analysis, using our database
results, enrolling all high risk for neonatal sepsis
newborns and positive blood cultures before 48 hours of
live.
Results: During last two years with approximate 6425
deliveries, we studied 193 neonates clinically and
microbiologically. Bacterial sepsis was confirmed in 6
cases. Between them 4 were premature and 2 were
mature newborns.
Conclusions: We conclude that incidence of the early
onset neonatal bacterial sepsis is higher in population of
preterm, than in population of the term newborns 0,96%.
Results that we found are similar in literature.

Background and Aims: Neonatal herpes simplex virus
(HSV) infection is one of the life-threatening infections
of newborns. Infections are categorized by extent of
disease into skin/eye/ mouth, central nervous system and
disseminated disease categories. Each disease category
is responsible for roughly one third of neonatal
infections. We aim in this article guideline on the
diagnosis, prevention and effective management of
neonatal (HSV) infection.
Methods: This paper focuses on the advances that have
been made in our understanding of the pathogenesis,
diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of (HSV)
infections.
Results: Many of the infections result from
asymptomatic cervical shedding of virus after a primary
episode of genital HSV in the third trimester. Infection
may occur in uterus, by transplacental or ascending
infection, by exposure to genital lesions during delivery,
or postnatal from relatives or attendants. Most cases of
neonatal HSV disease are caused by HSV type 2.
Diagnosis of neonatal infection requires a very high
level of clinical awareness. Direct immunofluorescence
and cultures are reliable diagnostic tests. Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful diagnostic tool that
has supplanted brain biopsy as the modality of choice
for diagnosing HSV CNS disease.
Conclusions: Careful physical examination and
appropriate investigations of the infant should
accurately identify the infection in the majority of cases.
Monitoring of hydration and renal function as well as
meticulous supportive care of a very sick infant is also
required. Treatment is recommended where diagnosis is
confirmed or there is a high level of suspicion.

Background and Aims: Newborns are in risk of acute
bacterial infection for numerous reasons. One of the
risks is preterm delivery. Morbidity and mortality are
also higher in preterm newborns. To estimate how often
the bacteria is found in umbilical cord blood in preterm
and term newborns.
Methods: We prospectively reviewed umbilical cord
blood samples of all preterm newborns and randomly
chosen term newborns during 3 months period in
Clinical of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Podgorica.
Results: 123 samples are examined, out of which 24 are
from preterm and 99 from term newborns. 4 out of 99
were positive and among preterms, none had positive
result.
Conclusions: This investigation has demonstrated that
bacterias are not found more often in preterm than in
term newborns. Therefore, we can conclude that other
factors have role in appearance of infection in preterm
newborns.

Departamento de Pediatria, Hospital Fernando
Fonseca, Amadora, Portugal
Background and Aims: Respiratory Syncicial Virus
(RSV) infections are rare in Neonatal Intensive Care
Units (NICU). However, nosocomial outbreaks occur,
leading to major morbidity among premature babies,
especially those with chronic lung disease (CLD).
Characterization of RSV infection in the NICU, clinical
and economic evaluation.
Methods: Characterization of RSV infection in the
NICU, clinical and economic evaluation.
Results: Twenty four (2,8%) out of 865 neonates had
RSV infection: 21 cases were studied. Incidence was
higher in 2003 (71,4%), during January (5/21) and
December (3/21). The mean age of infected infants was
40 days with mean gestational age (GA) and birth
weight of 29 weeks and 1273g respectively. Mean
weight at onset of symptoms was 1629g. Six infants
(28%) had CLD. Three infants (14,3%) required
intubation and one (4,8%) non invasive mechanical
ventilation. There were no deaths morbidity had
additional charges: Expenses with diagnosis tests and a
prolonged stay of 49 days, with costs of 16 959 Euros.
Conclusions: Reduction in RSV infection in 2004 was
probably due to restriction of visits and reinforcement of
prevention measures. Severity of infection was related
to lower GA (p= 0,002) and BW (p=0,011), lower
weight at onset of the symptoms (p=0,001). Morbidity
lead to a more prolonged stay of length with economic,
clinical and social repercussions.

Background and Aims: Emerging evidence indicates a
link between intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and
major adult-onset diseases. Here, we describe previously
unrecognized, phenotypical features in children with
idiopathic IUGR/SGA.
Methods: A total of 77 Italian children (age: 9.45 ±
2.08 years) with antenatally diagnosed IUGR and SGA
birth were examined, and subdivided into two groups
(“variant” vs. controls) according to auricle morphology
deviation from normal. The following variables were
determined: 1) external ear auricle geometry [maximum
width of longest axis (LA); shortest axis (SA); distance
of SA from the lowest auricle point (SA-D); SA/LA and
LA/SA-D ratios]; 2) posterior communicating arteries
(PCoAs) function (increased flow velocity in the
posterior cerebral artery>20% during ipsilateral
compression of the common carotid artery) (transcranial
doppler ultrasonography; Philips Sonos 5500);
3) articular mobility (Beighton’s 9-point scale); 4) skin
softness; and 5) distortion product evoked otoacoustic
emissions (DPOAEs) (ILO 292 DP Echoport).
Results: A total of 27/77 (35.06%) children showed a
variant auricle shape. Lower SA-D/LA ratio and higher
SA/LA and SA-D asymmetry indices (p<0.0001),
excess of bilaterally non-functioning PCoAs
(p<0.0001), higher Beighton’s scores (p<0.0001),
excessive skin softness (p<0.0001), and evidence of
bilateral DPOAEs notches (p<0.0001), as compared to
the control IUGR/SGA subjects.
Conclusions: The phenotype of the described
IUGR/SGA variant is likely the consequence of a large
developmental field disturbance occurring early in
embryogenesis. We propose that the observed
phenotypical constellation may represent an
unrecognized variant of IUGR. Further research is
needed in order to assess its frequency, geographic
distribution and possible relationships with long-term
prognosis.

Background and Aims: The study aims to assess the
impact of neonatal resuscitation program (APA/AHA)
on the management and outcome of the birth asphyxia
and to determine differences between the approaches to
resuscitation in trained and untrained maternity houses.
Methods: The multi-center study was conducted in 12
randomly selected maternity houses; I group include (8
trained institutions) and the control II group (4 untrained
institutions). Information was collected using special
record form.
Results: The results emphasized significant difference
in conducting of resuscitation procedures between
groups. The nessessity of resuscitation in I group was
8,2%, while in II group 14,3%. In the second group
initial steps of resuscitation were conducted only in
4,6%, in I group in all cases of resuscitation. The usage
of medications was higher in II group (8,8%) then in I
(0,79%). For infants of I group requiring resuscitation
statistical significance is achieved between the 1 and 5
minute Apgar score, (p< 0.05), comparing to II group.
The incidence of RDS, Asphyxia and MAS was higher
in the II group, as well as referrals to high level
hospitals. In II group thermal control was neglected
body temperature was measured only in 26,6%
compared to I group (72,7%).
Conclusions: The introduction of NRP was associated
with significant improvement in evaluation and
management of the neonates in delivery room.
DO WE GET MORE HIGH RISK NEWBORNS?
E M Zisovska, J T Zivkovik, L B Spasova
Department of Neonatology, Obstetric and Gynecology
Clinic, Skopje, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Annual perinatal data show
changes in some perinatal indicators, especially for high
risk newborns who takes the greatest part in morbidity
and mortality rates. The aim is to present prematurity
rate, the incidence of Small for Gestational Age babies
(SGA) and Large for GA babies (LGA) in non selected
neonatal population throughout Macedonia in last 5
years (2000-2004) and to find the trends.
Methods: Annual perinatal reports, retrospective
population study using epidemiological method.
Results: the most striking is the decreasing number of
live births in last five years, starting from 25255 (2000)
to 22836 (2004) (decrease of 10,6% for 5 years).
Unfortunately, the prematurity rate has an increasing
tendency, from 5,1% (2000) to 6,3% (2004), an increase
of 23%, and this group has the highest risk for survival
and morbidity. The percent of SGA babies has increased
from 9,45% to 10,6%, (increase 12%), and LGA from
6,8% to 7,4% (increase 8,8%). On the other side, there is
a great improvement of the obstetric care, and the
percent of pregnant women who have 5 and more
antenatal controls (as standard) is higher, in 2000-
48,8% and in 2004-60,8%. This fact suggests that
despite the better obstetric and perinatal care, the
number of high risk newborns is getting higher.
Conclusions: : There are a lot of reasons why we get
these results (social, economic, etc). Although at the
first sight it is not too great increase, it means a lot,
because the trend towards getting more risky newborns
is obvious and happened within short period of
investigation.
NEONATAL HEMOCHROMATOSIS –
SUCCESSFUL SHORT TIME OUTCOME

Background and Aims: Neonatal hemochromatosis
(NH) is a rare disease of gestation associated with fetal
- 266 -
liver injury and extrahepatic siderosis. The etiology of
NH is not fully understood, but the gene mutation that
causes NH has not been identified. The alloimmune
etiology has been suggested.
Methods: We describe a case of NH in a term baby with
successful short time outcome.
Results: The baby was born on 40th week of gestation
with birthweight 3754 g and Apgar score 8/7/7 with
manifested haemorrhagic syndrome. Early neonatal
period complicated with severe anemia, thrombo-
cytopenia (18x10 l), hepatosplenomegalia, respiratory
disorders and hepatic insufficiency, which culminated in
remarkable cholestasis (S-Bil-conj 249 mmol/l; S-AST
630 U/l, S-ALT 516 U/l) and severe iron overload (S-
Ferritin 7417 mg/l, S-TRFsat 99,1%) at the age of 2
weeks. Cholestasis and iron deposition was confirmed
by liver biopsy. Hemotransfusion, thrombomass and
intravenous immunglobulin transfusions were applied.
DNA-based test for the gene mutation showed the child
to be a heterosygote for the mutation C282Y. Primary
possible etiological factors as hepatotropic infections,
metabolic and autoimmune diseases were excluded.
With iron reduction therapy (Desferal, antioxidants,
erythropoetin), laboratory findings (total bilirubin,
aminotransferases, ferritin and transferrin saturation)
gradually returned to normal at the age of 4-5 months.
The baby had normal neurodevelopment and normal
hepatic function nonetheless moderate
hepatosplenomegaly at the end of first half-year of life.
Conclusions: Severe NH was diagnosed after birth by
clinical, biochemical and liver biopsy findings. On the
bases of successful recovery from severe NH the
alloimmune neonatal hemochromatosis can be
suggested.
GROWTH-RESTRICTION AND FETAL
DISTRESS - AN INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR
FOR MATERNAL AND NEONATAL
MORBIDITY
E Petkovska, S Jancevska
Department of Neonatology, University Clinic of
Gynecology and Obstetrics, Skopje, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Growth-restricted infants do
not tolerate the stress of delivery a well as normally
grown infants. They are more prone to intrapartum
distress, operative way of delivery and perinatal
asphyxia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
contribution of the fetal distress and growth-restriction
as combined pathology to maternal and neonatal
morbidity.
Methods: We have done a prospective study of early
maternal and neonatal complications on 160 growth-
restricted infants and compared with 200 normal
pregnancies. We used SPSS 1.1 and Statgraf for WIN
2.1 statistical programs. Results were compared by
Pearson Chi-Square (p<0.05) and Logistic regression
analyses.
Results: Operative way of delivery had 52 (66.3%)/54
growth-restricted pregnancies with fetal distress vs. 47
(44.34%)/106 growth-restricted pregnancies without
fetal distress (p<0.05). Perinatal asphyxia had 37
((68.52%)/54 growth-restricted infants with fetal
distress vs. 20 (18.87%)/106 growth-restricted infants
without fetal distress (p<0.05). The combination of
growth-restriction and fetal distress was found to be an
independent risk factor for cesarean section (OR
32.64;95%CI:7.55-141.0) and perinatal asphyxia (OR
9.36;95%CI:4.41-19.86).
Conclusions: Growth-restricted fetuses should be
monitored carefully and continuously during delivery. In
the face of deteriorating fetal status, a cesarean section
should be performed. Because growth-restricted infants
are more prone to hypoxemia during delivery, neonatal
team capable of managing perinatal asphyxia should be
available at the time of delivery. Growth-restriction and
fetal distress as combined pathology is multiplicity the
risk for early maternal and neonatal morbidity. Close
collaboration between obstetricians and neonatologist is
essential for adequate care of the growth-restricted
fetuses.
THE USE OF 20% ALBUMIN IN THE
NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT
I Morris, E J Molloy
Department of Neonatology, National Maternity
Hospital, Dublin, Ireland
Background and Aims: There is a paucity of evidence
for the use of 20% albumin in neonates. We aimed to
evaluate 20% human albumin use in neonates and assess
its efficacy in the management of hypoalbuminemia.
Methods: All infants treated with 20% albumin infusion
in a tertiary referral maternity hospital were included.
Records were reviewed to identify patient
demographics, indications for albumin treatment, means
of administration, duration of hospital stay, mortality,
morbidity and any evidence or suggestion of adverse
reactions to albumin administration.
Results: 30 infants (9 Female, 21 Male) were included
with a mean gestational age of 32.2+/-5.3 and birth
weight of 1893+/- 1136g. The mean number of hours
ventilated was 263 hours and 17 had positive blood
cultures. There was a wide variation in albumin use in a
single institution. Concurrent frusemide increased in
urine output was observed (p=0.02) and albumin levels
increased following albumin infusion (mean rise 6.67g/l,
p=<0.05) for 48hours. No adverse events were
associated with albumin administration.
Conclusions: Neonatal serum albumin can be increased
by 20% albumin infusion albeit briefly and urine output
enhanced by concurrent frusemide administration.
However prospective randomised controlled trials are
needed to further assess efficacy of 20% human albumin
administration in neonates and devise standardized
clinical guidelines.
NON SPECIFIC PRESENTATIONS OF
NEONATAL URINARY TRACT INFECTION
P A Valencia, B Chandler, A Soliz
Division of Neonatology, Miami Children's Hospital,
Miami, FL, USA
Background and Aims: Urinary tract infections (UTI)
in neonates can result in significant acute and long term
complications. Febrile neonates are routinely screened
- 267 -
for UTI; but neonates with UTI could be afebrile and
present with nonspecific symptoms or be asymptomatic
and the diagnosis could be missed. The purpose of this
study was to describe the different presentations of UTI
in neonates admitted from home to our Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Miami Children's
Hospital (MCH).
Methods: We reviewed the medical records of newborn
infants from 37 to 44 weeks post conceptional age at the
time of admission from home to our NICU and
diagnosed with UTI for the time period from 2000 to
2006. UTI was defined as the presence of greater than
10,000 colony forming units of bacteria in a urine
sample obtained by urethral catheterization.
Results: Seventy patients were included in the study.
The most frequent presentations of illness were: fever
(49%), irritability (27%), emesis (18%), and jaundice
(10%), Of 36 afebrile patients, 11 presented with emesis
(30%), 5 with jaundice (13%), and 3 with irritability
(8.3%). Other presentations included decreased oral
intake, hypoactivity, diarrhea, apnea and hypotonia.
Only 1 patient was asymptomatic. The presentation of
emesis without fever as sign of UTI was more frequent
in the past 2 years when screening of more babies with
emesis began.
Conclusions: The diagnosis of UTI in neonates who
present with symptoms other than fever needs to be
considered. Afebrile infants with emesis and other non-
specific symptoms should be screened for UTI.

Pediatrics, Athens University, Medical School, Athens,
Greece
Background and Aims: Cystatin C, an endogenous
marker of renal function, correlating better with
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) than creatinine, presents
higher serum levels immediately after birth, followed by
a considerable decrease, due to postnatal renal
maturation. Animal studies have shown that intrauterine
growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with reduction
in nephron number and increased glomeruli size, leading
to hyperfiltration and hypertension later in life. This
study aimed to investigate serum cystatin levels in
IUGR (<10th customized centile, due to gestational
pathology) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA)
full term fetuses and neonates on postnatal day 1 and 4,
as well as their mothers.
Methods: Serum cystatin C levels were measured by
enzyme immunoassay in 20 IUGR and 20 AGA mother-
infant sets.
Results: Fetal Cystatin C levels were significantly
higher in the AGA than in the IUGR group (p=0.001).
No correlation was found in the IUGR and AGA group
between maternal levels, and fetal, neonatal day 1 or
neonatal day 4 levels.
Conclusions: In conclusion, fetal cystatin C serum
levels are lower in the IUGR group, possibly due to
increased glomeruli size and subsequent hyperfiltration.
In addition, triggered renal maturation, consequent to
intrauterine stress could be also responsible. The lack of
correlation between fetal and maternal cystatin C levels
may imply its exclusively neonatal origin, as it has been
previously reported that this substance does not cross
the placental barrier.

Background and Aims: To describe a case of
congenital mesoblastic nephroma (CMN) in a premature
child in conjunction with maternal hypertension during
pregnancy including prenatal diagnosis, complications,
and treatment.
Methods: Presenting signs and symptoms of mother and
child, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of the patient.
Results: Hypertension was found in a 25 year old
pregnant women without any other symptoms or signs
of preeclampsia. Fetal ultrasound examination showed
polyhydramnion and an abdominal tumor arising from
the right kidney. By 30 weeks of gestation the boy was
born spontaneously, birth weight was 1450g. Physical
examination revealed a right upper quadrant mass. Due
to respiratory distress syndrome diagnosed shortly after
birth the patient needed mechanical ventilation for 3
days. Hypertension with a maximum systolic blood
pressure of 129 mmHg and elevated serum renin
concentration of 10858 μU/ml (normal 11-147 μU/ml)
was found at day 3. Abdominal ultrasound and magnetic
resonance imaging confirmed a tumor of 4,2 x 3,9 x 4,2
cm arising from the right kidney. On day 19 after
delivery a right-sided tumor nephrectomy was
performed. The blood pressure immediately returned
normal without any treatment. Histologically, tumor
specimens were classified as classic, focally cellular
CMN.
Conclusions: Unexplained maternal hypertension may
be the presenting symptom of congenital mesoblastic
nephroma.

Background and Aims: To determine if sevoflurane,
an inhaled anesthetic agent, can be used with safety and
efficacity for premedication of intubation in term and
preterm neonates.
Methods: A prospective randomised controlled non-
blinded study in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit.
Minute by minute heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood
pressure, transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2), and
number of bradycardia (HR < 100 bpm) and
desaturation (SpO2 < 85% for more than 30 seconds)
were noted from 5 minutes before to 10 minutes after
intubation. Operator experience, facility and number of
attempts were collected.
Results: 33 neonates (19 in the study group and 14 in
the control group) were randomly allocated to receive
sevoflurane (concentrations varying from 2 to 5%) or no
premedication (preoxygenation with 100% oxygen
alone) before their intubation. No major adverse events
were noted in the study group (hypotension (37,5% vs
37,5%, NS), number of desaturation (37,5% vs 44,5%,
NS)). Hypertension (56,3% vs 25%, p=0,04) and
incidence of bradycardias (44,4% vs 8,3%, p<0,01)
were greater in the control group. Intubation was easier
in the study group : no movements: 95,5% vs 28%
(p<0,005), good glottis visualisation: 73% vs 33%
(p=0,013). The failure rate was lower in the study group
(25% vs 39%), but this difference was not statistically
significant.
Conclusions: Premedication for intubation with
sevoflurane in neonates is well tolerated, even in the less
mature. It facilitates the condition of intubation and
leads to less adverse events. Other studies are necessary
to confirm these preliminary results.
CLINICAL RELIABILITY OF TWO PAIN
SCALES FOR NEWBORNS
C V Bellieni, S Perrone, F Bagnoli, G Buonocore
Department of Pediatrics, University of Siena, Siena,
Italy
Background and Aims: We studied the reliability of
two of them.
Methods: We studied two groups of babies during a
heelprick. The first group of 20 premature babies was
studied using the PIPP scale, and the second group of 20
term babies was studied with the NIPS scale. We
compared the pain scores given by nurse A who took the
blood sample with those given by nurse B who was
present during heelprick and those of nurse C who
watched later the video clip of the blood sampling.
Results: NIPS: 8/20 scores were different between
nurse A and nurse C; but only in 1 case this difference
was >2. In the case of nurse B, the differences from
nurse C were 12/20 and also in this case only 1 baby
was scored with a score difference >2. The scores of
nurse B did not differ significantly from those of nurse
A. PIPP: 16/20 scores were different between nurse A
and nurse C; in 9 case this difference was >2. In the case
of nurse B, the differences from nurse C were 17/20 and
in this case 6 babies obtained a score difference >2. The
number of scores of nurse A diverging from reference
was not statistically significant.
Conclusions: Though both scales are good for research
studies, further efforts to find reliable tools to assess
neonatal pain in a clinical set are needed.

Public Health Agency of Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada
Background and Aims: Encephalopathy incidence due
to severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (NH) has
increased, attributed to conservative jaundice
management and earlier newborn discharge. Neonatal
herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection has changed in
prevalence, presentation and infection types. Mortality
remains high despite improved diagnostic tests and
antiviral therapy. NH and HSV study results were
compared on incidence, maternal and newborn profiles,
and burden of illness to better define clinical and public
health impacts. Timely diagnosis of congenital
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains important.
Methods: Over 2400 paediatricians monthly report rare
diseases according to preset protocols. Confidentiality is
mandatory. All studies receive ethical approval.
Results: The CPSP confirmed 259 NH cases in term
neonates. A high percentage of discharged newborns
(72%) were readmitted at an early age of five days with
high-unconjugated bilirubin (median: 471 μ mole/L).
Majorities were only breastfed (81%) with over
representation of non-white ethnic groups. Exchange
transfusions were performed in 22%. Evidence of
clinical bilirubin encephalopathy was present at
discharge in 5%. Canada established a national
incidence rate of 5.9/100,000 live births for HSV with
fatality rates of 16%. HSV-1 disease accounted for 63%
of cases. Localized disease to skin, eye and mucosa
represented 60% of cases. High percentage of mothers
were unaware of previous HSV infection prior to
delivery and mothers under 20 years of age were
disproportionately represented. A survey pre-CMV
study documented diagnostic approaches of
respondents.
Conclusions: Systematic analyses and interpretation of
this surveillance identified important medical and public
health actions that will benefit children and their
families.

Background and Aims: Based on the analysis of
newborns illness severity were introduced mortality
prediction scores. The objective was to compare the
prediction efficiency for mortality and disabilities
- 269 -
(chronic lung disease, hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and
prematurely retinopathy), among two methods applied
on low birth weight newborns. They are the Clinical
Risk Index for Babies (CRIB) and the Score for
Neonatal Acute Physiology Perinatal Extension
(SNAPPE-II).
Methods: Were included 60 newborns with birth weight
less than 1500g and/or gestational age under 32 weeks.
We also compared mortality with birth weight,
gestational age, APGAR and others risk factors.
Results: The average birth weight was 1083g
(S.D.323g) and gestational age of 29w (S.D. of 2.7). To
APGAR, 31.7% had a score lower than 7 in the 5th life
minute. For the CRIB, the found average value was 6.48
(S.D 6.1) and, for the SNAPPE-II was 29.1 (S.D. 27.0).
These variables had statistics significance for mortality
(p<0.001) with qui-square test. The gestational age
lower than 30 weeks, showed a relative risk of 2.46
(CI=1.16-5.23), the birth weight a R.R. of 4.7 (CI=1.28-
17.24), the 5th minute APGAR <7 a RR of 2.0
(CI=1.11-3.58), the CRIB with R.R. of 2.48 (CI=1.43-
4.27) and the SNAPPE-II with R.R. of 3.58 (CI=1.22-
10.45). After logistic regression, only the birth weight
showed significance (p=0.01). Neither methods predict
disabilities.
Conclusions: We can conclude that birth weight was
the most efficient variable to predict mortality in these
studied premature newborns. However, we indicate the
CRIB for initial illness severity evaluation due to its
easier use.

Health, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK
Background and Aims: Although the limits of survival
for premature infants are continually being pushed back,
infants born extremely prematurely are characterized by
high rates of mortality and neurodevelopmental
disability. Consequently the treatment of extremely
premature infants is contentious and health
professionals’ views may vary, with possible
implications for both clinical practice and infant
outcomes. This study aims to use qualitative methods to
investigate health professionals’ attitudes to the care of
extremely premature infants.
Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted
with UK health professionals involved in the care of
extremely premature infants. Interviews were
transcribed verbatim and subjected to theme analysis.
Results: Major themes emerging from the data
included: Parental Involvement in the Decision Making
Process – a number of participants held strong and
opposing views regarding the appropriateness and
feasibility of allowing parents to be involved in care
decisions; Infant Quality of Life – participants’ care
decisions were strongly influenced by infants’ quality of
life rather than endorsing life at all costs; Treatment
Protocols – participants’ views regarding the
appropriateness of strict rules and protocols in the care
of extremely premature infants varied;
Depersonalization – some participants described
disengaging from emotionally difficult situations; Cost
of Care – several participants questioned whether the
resources involved in caring for extremely premature
infants could be justified.
Conclusions: Health professionals’ attitudes to the care
of extremely premature infants are multidimensional
and often polarized. Quantitative research is needed to
examine factors influencing views and to determine the
impact of practitioners’ attitudes on clinical decision
making and infant outcomes.

Mallorca, Spain
Background and Aims: The care of premature infants
is a matter of a great importance and of considerable
interest during the last two centuries. In 1898 premature
births ranged from 15 to 30 per cent of all births in
Europe and in USA. The aim of this paper is to describe
the recommendations published in some scientific
articles about the care of premature infants at the end of
the XIX century in Europe.
Methods: The recommendations written in these three
articles: Incubators and milk laboratory feeding (1897);
the care and feeding of premature infants (1898) and
The care of premature and feeble infants (1898) have
been analyzed.
Results: As Flacker said 'the principles to be observed
in the care of premature babies can be deduced from de
conditions of intrauterine life'. The technological
advances as the incubators or the artificial feeding were
the mean purposes that the authors written in their
papers. The temperature of a child born must be
conserved with an incubator as the employed by Denuce
(1857), Credé (1884) or Tarnier (1880). Breastfeeding
was recommended as the best way to fed premature
infants but when this option was impossible, laboratory
milk, was chosen despite to be very expensive for some
families.
Conclusions: As the papers analyzed show, the
physicians were worried about the high rate of
premature babies in their countries, so they tried to
answer to the babies needs with the technology available
at that time, such as incubators and laboratory milk.

Background and Aims: End-tidal carbon monoxide
production, corrected for ambient CO (ETCOc), is
associated with severity of respiratory distress syndrome
(RDS) in premature infants and may be used in the
prediction of chronic lung disease. In term infants
ETCOc measurements are validated as parameter for
hemolytic disease. However, normal values for ETCOc
among preterm infants are not available. To obtain
these, we measured ETCOc in term and preterm infants
during the first week of life and compared these with
ETCOc during hemolysis.
Methods: Using the COCO2 Puff End-Tidal Breath
Analyzer (Everest Biomed Instr, Chesterfield, MO)
ETCOc (ppm) was measured in healthy preterm and
term infants from non-smoking mothers, at days 1, 3, 5
and 7, together with serum bilirubin and hematocrit
(Ht).
Results: 61 infants were included: 24 GA 32 wks; 20
GA 32-37 wks; 13 healthy term infants and 4 with AO-
hemolytic disease. Mean±SD ETCOc values were not
different between groups (Figure). ETCOc was
increased during hemolysis (days 1 and 3), showing
higher values than in healthy preterm and term infants
(p< 0.001).
Conclusions: ETCOc measurements are similar in
healthy preterm infants and term infants during the first
week of life. ETCOc is increased during hemolysis.

Background and Aims: Medication errors occur in
relation to the many steps involved in the process of
drug use in neonates. To err is human, so errors should
not be considered as punishable acts, but rather there
causes should be analysed to prevent new incidents. We
aim to report the effect on the error rate of the simple
review and registration of medication use, before a
specific preventive strategy was implemented.
Methods: Deviations from drug use related to legibility,
dose, units, route of administration, and dosing intervals
were prospectively registered in a level III regional
NICU. The study was planed in three steps: a pilot phase
(n=122 drug prescriptions and their transcriptions by
nurses) to know the incidence of errors; a full phase
(n=4,182 observations) before any intervention was
implemented, and a final one to measure the effect of
the preventives on error rate. We report the results of the
first two phases.
Results: Prescription errors were detected in 35.2% and
20.6%, of the pilot and full phase, respectively. The
incidence of all types of drug prescription errors was
smaller in the second phase, except for route of
administration. The rate of transcription errors was
similar in both phases (21.5 vs 23.7%).
Conclusions: We observed that the presence of a person
reviewing and registering the drug administration
records had itself a positive impact on the overall drug
administration process. This should be taken in
consideration when evaluating the efficacy of specific
interventions to prevent medication errors.

Clinics, Zwolle, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: In newborns measurement of
glucosuria by means of a visually readabile teststrip
(glucostick) is a frequently used test. The newborn’s
urine can be collected by putting a piece of cloth in the
diaper. After compression of the wetted cloth urine can
be evacuated with a syringe and subsequently applicated
to the teststrip (dripstick method). Alternatively
teststrips are frequently interpreted after pressing the
strip in a wet diaper for a few seconds (diaperstick
method). The aim of this study was to compare both
methods in measuring glucosuria.
Methods: In 47 premature newborns 201 urinesamples
ere tested both with the diaperstickmethod and the
dripstickmethod. Two different manufacturers were
used: Multistick (Bayer) and Combur3Test (Roche).
Results of both type of strips are categorized as 0, +, ++,
+++ or ++++, in ascending degree of glucosuria. All
samples were interpreted by the same investigator.
Results: The proportion of agreement between the
diaperstickmethod and the dripstickmethod was 0,35 in
the 100 samples tested with the Multistick and 0,64 in
the 101 samples tested with the Combur3Test. The
weighted Kappa using the Multistick was 0,54 (95%-CI
0,42-0,66) and using the Combur3Test 0,45 (95%-CI
0,34-0,55).
Conclusions: In both the Multistick and the
Combur3Test the agreement between the
dripstickmethod and the diaperstick method is moderate.
We speculate that the dripstickmethod is more sensitive
for the measurement of glucosuria in newborns than the
diapermethod.

Background and Aims: Fetal bone accumulation in
calcium and phosphorus occurs in the last trimester of
pregnancy. Thus, preterm infants, and specially those
undergoing intensive care and thereby periods of non
optimal nutrition are at risk of osteopenia. Measuring
the speed of ultrasound (SOS) in bones is a promising,
bed-side and radiation-free means of assessing bone
mineralization with the potential to replace the current
bone-mineral density assessment techniques which
produce ionizing radiation.
Methods: SOS was measured using the Sunlight
Omnisense Premier 7000® (mean of 3 cycles) in the
right tibial cortex of premature infants born before 32
wks gestation at 4 weeks of age. Bone mineral content
(BMC; g) and bone mineral density (BMD; g/cm2) were
determined the same day by the DEXA ODR-1500
Hologic® with integrated Infant Whole Body software.
Results: A total of 60 measurements of SOS and 20
assessments of osteodensitometry (DEXA) were
performed in 20 preterm infants (median GA 30 3/7
wks, BW 1175 g). The intra-rater reliability of SOS
measurements was 0.904. The linear relationship
between SOS and tibial BMC was y=-0.0017x + 5.764;
r2=0.071, and between SOS and tibial BMD y=-0.011x
+ 0.082; r2=0.043.
Conclusions: There was no close relationship between
SOS and BMC or BMD as measured over the tibia. This
may be due to the fact that SOS and DEXA measure
different aspects of bone mineralization and structure,
and therefore that they cannot be used interchangeably.

Department of Paediatrics and Neonatology, Faculty of
Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic
Background and Aims: Inadequate capacity of energy
production due to delayed biosynthesis and proper
assembly of respiratory chain complexes in the inner
mitochondrial membrane may play an important role in
the neonatal morbidity, especially in very premature
neonates.
Methods: The activities and amount of respiratory chain
(RC) complexes and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)
were analyzed in isolated muscle mitochondria obtained
at autopsy in 19 premature neonates using
spectrophotometric and radioenzymatic methods,
Western blotting and Blue-native electrophoresis. Two
groups of children recommended to muscle biopsy at the
age of 0.5-2 and 3-18 years served as controls.
Results: In premature neonates, the protein amount of
PDH and RC complexes I, III, IV and V were lower in
all analyzed samples in comparison with older children.
The activities of PDH and RC complexes I+III, II+III,
III and IV were lower in premature neonates in
comparison with older children. No differences were
found for complex II, only the activity of complex I was
higher in premature neonates than in older children.
PDH activity was lower in premature neonates with
hyperlactacidemia >5.9 mmol/l in comparison with
neonates with normal or mild increase of lactate.
Conclusions: Our study suggests, that in critically ill
premature neonates the activities and amount of
respiratory chain complexes and PDH in muscle
mitochondria are lower in comparison with older
children. The lower functional capacity of energy
production in premature neonates is influenced by the
delay in maturation of mitochondrial complexes
combined with increased protein degradation during
infection. This work was supported by IGA-MZ

Background and Aims: Recent evidences suggested
that elevated plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine
(ADMA) levels can be regarded as a marker of
endothelial dysfunction that mediates cardiovascular
morbidity. It may have a role in the cardiopulmonary
adaptation of the neonate. The present study was
undertaken to investigate the perinatal NO metabolism
by measuring l-arginine, ADMA, and symmetrical
dimethylarginine (SDMA) in cord blood, and in
peripheral plasma of the neonate.
Methods: Ten newborn infants of healthy mothers were
selected for the study. The mean birth weight and
gestational age of the newborn infants were 3330 g and
39.6 weeks (ranges 2560-4070 g and 39-40 weeks),
respectively. Blood samples were taken from the
umbilical vein and artery, and by venepuncture on the
second day of life into tubes in ice water containing
EDTA. Plasma concentrations of l-arginine, ADMA and
SDMA were measured by liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry method.
Results: L-arginine concentration in venous cord blood
(73.89±4.37 μmol/l,) was significantly higher than that
of umbilical artery (63.03±4.15 μmol/l; p<0.01). By the
second postnatal day l-arginine concentration markedly
fell to a value of 34.78±4.32 μmol/l (p<0.001). The
pattern of ADMA concentrations was similar to that of
l-arginine, its highest level was found in the umbilical
vein (1.06±0.08) followed by a slight decline in
umbilical artery (0.90±0.09; p<0.03) and by a further
fall on day 2 postnatally (0.66±0.05; p<0.001). A
statistically significant veno-arterious difference was
seen in cord blood SDMA levels (p<0.05), but their
postnatal fall did not occur.
- 272 -
Conclusions: Our data suggest that fetoplacental
ADMA has an important role in the circulatory
adaptation of the neonate.

NICU, Clinica Mangiagalli (IRCCS), University of
Milan, Milan, Italy
Background and Aims: Preterm infants (PT) have an
increased risk of low bone mass. Ultrasound velocity
[speed of sound (SOS)] has been proposed as a non
invasive, non ionizing and portable method of
evaluation of bone status. Several observations in PT at
birth show a significantly lower SOS than in term
infants (FT). To compare SOS of PT assessed at term
adjusted age to SOS of FT assessed within 72 hours of
life.
Methods: 29 PT (13 males; mean gestational age (GA)
31.2 wk; mean birth weight (BW) 1361 g±329; and 82
FT infants (46 males; mean BW 3218 g±418) at birth.
Body length (BL) was measured to the nearest 0,1 cm
on a Harpenden neonatometer (Holtain Ltd, UK) and
knee-heel length (TL) was measured using a heel-knee
caliper (Chasmors Ltd, UK). Bone status was evaluated
in the midpoint of the right tibia by quantitative
ultrasound (CS probe), Sunlight Omnisense (Sunlight
Medical Ltd, Israel) and expressed as the mean of three
SOS values assessed by the same operator.
Results: Mean SOS ±SD in PT was significantly lower
than SOS in FT (2894 ±214 vs 3042 ±138; p<0.001).
GA (r=0.50: p<0.05) was significantly correlated to
SOS in PT. No difference was found related to BW, BL,
TL, gender, and being SGA.
Conclusions: Bone mineralization in PT is significantly
lower than in FT. Our preliminary data suggest that
ultrasound velocity could be a non invasive procedure,
suitable for longitudinal studies in order to monitor bone
status in patients at high risk of bone breakability.

University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary
Background and Aims: To provide normal glucose
homeostasis for extremely immature newborns at the
early postnatal age represents a significant therapeutic
goal for the neonatal intensive care team. Physiologic
blood glucose levels and metabolism are critical factors
for disease-free survival. We were seeking early clinical
and laboratory signs which could detect or predict
disturbances of glucose metabolism and indication for
insulin treatment.
Methods: In a retrospective analysis we studied 169
extremely immature newborns with post menstrual
gestational age less than 26 weeks. Continuous insulin
infusion was initiated for those who developed
hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia. Each day of the first two
weeks of life insulin-, glucose intake were recorded
besides the parameters of ventilation therapy, blood gas,
ion values, glucose-, lactate concentrations, temperature
support, and other vital signs, treatments.
Results: Insulin treatment was initiated for 64 newborns
of the 169 extremely immature patients. The survival
rate for those patients who do not required insulin was
68%, and for those who needed continuous insulin
infusion was 61%. The insulin treatment group was
divided into two arms, the first who survived and the
second who does not survived the neonatal age. Our
results showed that besides glucose and potassium
levels, the metabolic acidosis, high blood lactate, low
carbon dioxide (independent from ventilatory therapy),
low body temperature, especially in the not surviving
group are significant risk factors for insulin treatment.
Conclusions: Early insulin intervention is critical for
controlling high glucose and potassium levels, and in the
decision making process the above introduced risk
factors might have benefits.

Background and Aims: Importance of performing
neonatal screening programs for congenital
hypothyreoidism, phenylketonuria and congenital
adrenal hyperplasia for Macedonian children.
Methods: NSCH was introduced in the Republic of
Macedonia in April 2002. 51200 newborns from the
Republic (exceptions Skopje and Bitola with children
screened in the neighboring pediatric laboratory) were
screened. For 10 months NSPKU and NSCAH also
functioned and 28600 children were screened for PKU,
9258 for CAH. A new design of the filter paper and
instructions were applied. Education was organized in
the delivery wards throughout Macedonia. A central
laboratory was set out and links with a reference
laboratory were established. Blood was collected (days
2-5 after birth) on filter paper and enzymatically assayed
for TSH, phenylalanine and 17 hydroxy progesterone.
Results: Seven children were screened positive with
high values of TSH. Venous samples confirmed the
diagnosis (low T4 and high TSH values). The thyroid
was hypoplasic/ectopic on ultrasound. In five cases
treatment begun in the first two weeks of life. Two
unfortunate exceptions were due to a temporary lack of
reagents or change in a home address. 7 detected
hypothyroid children out of 51200 screened suggest an
- 273 -
incidence of 1:7314 newborns. No case of PKU or CAH
was detected. So far no false-positive or false-negative
results were noticed. No recalls were realized for PKU
or CAH. However, 56 children (9.14%) with border line
screening results for TSH were recalled for additional
tests which proved to be within normal range.
Conclusions: The data suggest a need for
institualisation of the screening programs.

Background and Aims: There are several causes for
alterations of thyroid function. Quite prominent are
iodine deficiency during the perinatal period, and
exposure to an iodine excess, caused by iodine-
containing antiseptics (10,000 μg of iodine /mL) and
radiologic contrast media (250- 370 mg of iodine /mL).
The aim is to bring to the attention, that even a minor
iodine-overload may impair thyroid function during a
period of development when thyroid hormones are very
important for the brain.
Methods: Thyroid function and iodine excretion were
analysed at different postnatal ages.
Results: No dysfunction was found in the Screening
Program for congenital hypothyroidism before excess
iodine exposure, and with urinary iodine excretions
below 50 μg/L. After exposure, iodine in serum was
>100 μg/dL and in urine 200-6000 μg/L. Transient
hypothyroidism (Total serum thyroxine <4 ng/dL and
thyroid stimulating hormone levels > 10 mU/L) was
present in 4 patients after skin disinfection during
surgical procedures, 3 patients after gastrografin, 2
patient after angiography; another 2 patients presented
transient hyperthyrotropinaemia. Treatment with
thyroxine was started in all patients.
Conclusions: The precocious diagnosis and treatment of
the alterations of thyroid function associated with iodine
excess, could have beneficial effects in the prevention of
developmental abnormalities. We suggest a protocol to
evaluate thyroid function when iodine compounds are
used, either topically, as enema, or intravenously,
because of the blocking effect of iodine excess in the
thyroid gland. The risk of transient hypothyroidism may
be avoided by the use of iodine-free compounds.
Chlorhexidine should be used for skin disinfection and
surgery.

Background and Aims: Although hyperglycaemia is a
common problem in VLBW infants, there is a lack of
consensus with regard to its management. We
investigated current practice regarding management of
neonatal hyperglycaemia across the UK. Our aim was to
ascertain the working definition and management
strategy of neonatal hyperglycaemia in major neonatal
units across the UK.
Methods: Survey questionnaire was emailed to
consultants working in units with >6 NICU cots.
Results: 50% of 50 units have responded to date. 84%
respondents considered that incidence of hyperglycemia
is maximum in infants <1kg. 32% respondents use blood
glucose alone [median >10 (range 7-15mmol/L)], 44%
respondents use glucose > 10mmol/L and glycosuria,
and 24% use glucose >10mmol/L, glycosuria and
osmotic diuresis as their working definition of
hyperglycemia. Except one unit, all others use a
combination of decreased glucose delivery and insulin
for management of hyperglycemia.
Conclusions: There is a wide variation in practice
regarding management of neonatal hyperglycaemia. The
median glucose delivery rate conforms to optimal
delivery of 6-9mg/kg/min and suggests that a high
glucose delivery is not the predominant factor leading to
neonatal hyperglycaemia. The high proportion of units
practising glucose restriction warrants a review of
optimal nutritional strategy in this already malnourished
fragile population.

Background and Aims: Cryptorchidism occurs in 2-
5% of full term boys at birth. Because an undescended
testis may represent an atrophic or vanishing testis, it
has been suggested to use ultrasonography or even MRI
to verify its presence. The objective of this study was to
evaluate the rate of testicular descent in full term infants
with at least 1 non palpable testes at birth.
Methods: 5250 male infants were checked during a
period of 14 months. Infants with non palpable
unilateral or bilateral testis at the first examination, were
reexamined daily until their discharge (day 2-3 of life)
and weekly thereafter until the age of 2 weeks.
Premature infants delivered before 37 weeks of
- 274 -
gestation or those with additional genital anomalies
were excluded form the study.
Results: Forty one male infants were diagnosed as
having at least one non palpable testicle. In 8 infants
both testes were non palpable. 5 out of 41 diagnosed
infants (5 out of 49 testes) were lost to follow up. Of the
44 remaining testes, 26 (59%) became palpable within 3
days. Thirteen additional testes were palpable 4-14 days
later, 39 out of 44 (88%) were palpated within 2 weeks.
By 2 weeks of age all non-palpable testes that became
palpable were located in the inguinal canal.
Conclusions: A majority (88%) of non-palpable testes
at birth descend into the inguinal canal within 2 weeks.
We speculate that reexamination of these infants at the
age of 2 weeks will preclude unnecessary imaging
studies in most of them.

Background and Aims: Early diagnosis and treatment
of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) (~ 1/3000-1/4000
live births) prevent severe mental retardation in affected
patients. Only ~5% of the CH infants are detected by
clinical criteria before the results of the T4/TSH
population screening. As anemia is a frequent finding in
CH and depends on the degree of hypothyroidism, we
tested the hypothesis of a decreased reflectance in the
red section of the visible spectrum on blood spots from
CH newborns.
Methods: Spectrophotometry on filter paper-adsorbed
dried blood spots was performed for 16 CH newborns
and 322 matched control newborns. Coordinates in the
standard CIE-L*a*b* and L*C*H* space colors and
spectral reflectance curves were obtained (portable
spectrophotometer; 400-700 nm wavelengths range;
standard D65 illuminant) and computed by a color
software package (Colormedica, IntexSystem).
Accuracy of spectrophotometry in identifying CH
samples was evaluated by Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
Results: CH blood showed lower a*, b*, and C* values,
and higher H* (p<0.0001), with a significantly lower
reflectance in the 600-700 nm wavelengths range, as
compared to control samples (p<0.0001), whereas no
significant differences were observed for the adsorbing
paper samples. Values of H*>45.1 identified CH with
100% sensitivity, 87.3% specificity (AUC: 0.957, 95%
C.I.: 0.930-0.976, p<0.0001), while a* 12.87
discriminated CH specimens from controls with 100%
sensitivity and 87.3% specificity (AUC:0.939, 95% C.I.:
0.908-0.962, p<0.0001).
Conclusions: These findings could help CH screening
centres in selecting samples with highest priority, hence
possibly further anticipating the time at diagnosis and
hormonal replacement treatment in affected newborns.

Background and Aims: We can find the hyperglycemia
at the condition of acute illness easily. There is a report
that hyperglycemia cause the increase of morbidity and
mortality of many diseases. The purpose of this study is
to know how can the hyperglycemia influence to the
preterm infants 48 hours after be born.
Methods: A retrospective chart review for 77 premature
infants who were admitted to Pochun CHA University
neonatal intensive care unit between January 2002 and
March 2005 was done. They are all less than gestational
age 30 weeks. Infants were divided into two groups
depending upon their glucose level. One is the
hyperglycemia infants group whose glucose level is at
least one time more than 150mg/dL (n=38), the other is
the non-hyperglycemia infants group whose glucose
level is less than 150mg/dL (n=39).
Results: The average of the glucose level in the
hyperglycemia infants group is 222±65mg/dL, and the
non-hyperglycemia infants group is 112±22mg/dL. A
death rate of the hyperglycemia infants group is 42.1%
but the non-hyperglycemia infants group is 12.8%. The
death rate of the hyperglycemia infants group is higher
than non-hyperglycemia infants group definitely
P<0.01). There are no differences between two groups
of the rest which are initial clinical characteristics,
clinical features, clinical courses and complications.
Conclusions: We can bring to a conclusion that the
early hyperglycemia influence to the death rate of the
less than 30 weeks infants, and more positive treatment
of the early hyperglycemia will be help to the
improvement of the clinical progress.

Background and Aims: The present study examines
the relationship between the prenatal exposure to
Organochlorine Compounds (OCs) and their bio-
accumulate in fatty tissues with the LC-PUFA n3
plasma concentrations.
Methods: 72 Spanish mother-baby pairs were analysed.
Plasma phospholipids n-3 and n-6 PUFAs (in mg/dl)
and OCs (in ng/ml) were obtained in mother’s and
neonates’ plasma using Gas Chromatography-Mass
Spectrometry. The study has the corresponding ethical
approval. ANOVA, General Lineal Model and
correlations were done using SPSS Version 12.0.
*:p<0.05.
Results: OCs were found in different concentrations in
all the samples studied {Lindane: 88%, Vinclozolina:
96%, DDE: 99%, o,pDDT: 96.5%, Endosulfan sulphate:
97%..}. Plasma OCs concentrations were closely
correlated between mothers and their neonates. Positive
correlations between linoleic acid, acid araquidonic
(AA), as well as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) with some
of the OCs analysed were found. Some of the OCs
analysed resulted significantly lower in the mothers who
had higher levels of plasma phospholipids DHA at
delivery (underaverage of DHA vs upperaverage of
DHA: Endosulfan-II: 0.43 0.25 vs 0.20 0.03*;
Endosulfan-eter: 3.63 2.91 vs 0.22 0.05*). However,
most of the OCs resulted significantly higher depending
on plasma phospholipids AA concentrations at delivery
{underaverage of AA vs upperaverage of AA:
Endosulfan-I: 0.08 0.015 vs 0.18 0.04*; Dieldrin:
0.22 0.05 vs 0.66 0.13*; 0.54 0.05 vs 0.91 0.16*}.
Conclusions: Mothers with high DHA levels and low
AA levels in plasma had less concentrations of OCs and
consecuently less amount of these contaminants
achieved the foetus during pregnancy. This study is
partially financed by INMA Spanish Network of

Neonatal Unit, Juliana Childrens Hospital, The Hague,
The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Around 5% of infants born
through meconium stained amniotic fluid develop
meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Meconium, a
highly viscous substance, causes small airway
obstruction leading to airtrapping and atelectasis, in
addition to effects of local inflammation. Meconium
contains gastrointestinal secretions, cellular debris and
proinflammatory factors. DNA could contribute to the
viscosity of meconium, analogous to the situation in
sputum in cystic fibrosis patients. RhDNase treatment of
these patients induces mucolysis and improves airway
patency. Meconiumlysis based on DNA degradation
may create new therapeutic approaches in newborns
with MAS. We hypothesized that rhDNase decreases
meconium viscosity.
Methods: Sterile meconium samples were incubated
with rhDNase or PBS as control. Final concentrations of
substrate varied from 250 to 1000 microgram per gram
meconium. Viscosity was measured with the CAP 2000
viscometer. For each sample, the arithmetic mean of
three measurements was calculated.
Results: Meconium viscosity (in mPa.s) decreased
significantly (figure 1) with rhDNase and control
(p< 0.000; 95% CL: 14.8%-98.5%). There was no
significant decrease in viscosity between meconium
treated with 250 μg and 1000 μg rhDNAse or PBS
(p=0.106; 95%CL: -4.4%-12.1%).
Conclusions: In vitro, both rhDNase and PBS decrease
meconium viscosity significantly, an effect attributable
to dilution as no difference was found between
rhDNAse and PBS. Possibly, the rhDNAse is
inactivated by meconium or the DNA content in
meconium is too low. Moreover, other factors than
DNA could be primarily responsible for the visco-elastic
properties of meconium.

Background and Aims: Oxidative stress is associated
with severe complications of prematurity, such as
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular
leukomalacia, and necrotising enterocolitis. Glutathione
is the major intracellular antioxidant with a mean
fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of 65% in healthy adults
[Lyons, 2000]. The FSR reflects the fraction that is
renewed per unit of time. Our aim was to determine the
FSR of glutathione in preterm infants, receiving only
glucose, on the second postnatal day.
Methods: Preterm infants with a birth weight <1000
gram were given a primed continuous infusion of
[1-13C]glycine. Blood was sampled after 4, 5, and 6
hours. [1-13C]glycine incorporated in glutathione was
measured with liquid chromatography – istope ratio
mass spectrometry (IRMS). As a precursor for
glutathione synthesis, intracellular free [1-13C]glycine
enrichment was measured with gas chromatography –
IRMS.
Results: Glutathione FSR of eight preterm infants (birth
weight 807 ± 130 g, gestational age 27 1/7 ± 1 5/7
weeks), receiving only glucose (6.0 mg/(kg×min)), were
- 276 -
measured on postnatal day 2. Glycine enrichment
reached a plateau within 4 hours after start of
administration (4.55 ± 0.99 mole percent excess).
Glutathione FSR was found to be 44 ± 5%/day.
Conclusions: Preterm infants, receiving glucose only,
have a low FSR of glutathione as compared to healthy
adults.

Department of Pediatrics, Newborn Section,
Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Hospital
de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil
Background and Aims: Some VLBW infants present
growth retardation in infancy. Aim: Evaluate risk factors
for growth failure at 1 year corrected age of newborns
with birth weight 1500 grams.
Methods: A cohort of newborns with birth weight
1500 grams admitted between 11/2003 to 12/2004 was
followed up to 12 months corrected age. Weight, length
and head circumference were plotted on NCHS curves.
The group was divided in relation to Z score: <2 SD and
2 SD. Birth weight, gestational age, adequacy to
gestational age, length of hospital stay, maternal
education, hospital readmission were compared between
both groups. Birth weight 750 grams, presence of
PIVH and/or PVL, clinical sepsis and maternal
education 9 years were also analyzed.
Results: 116 patients were admitted, 32 died, 14 never
returned to follow up clinic, 5 died during the follow
and 11 were lost. 54 newborns were included in the
study. Head circumference, length and weight were < 2
SD in 6, 7 and 9 newborns respectively. No studied risk
factor was associated to low head circumference or
length. Low gestational age was associated to weight
< 2 SD (p=0.024). There was a significant statistical
association between one year low weight and birth
weight 750 grams, presence of PIVH and/or PVL,
clinical sepsis and maternal education 9 years
(p=0.037).
Conclusions: Birth weight 750 grams, presence of
PIVH and/or PVL, clinical sepsis and maternal
education 9 years are important risk factors for growth
failure in VLBW infants.

Background and Aims: Advantages of early enteral
nutrition on preterm infants are widely described in
literature. In the year 2000, in our unit, we started to
introduced nutritional guidelines, to promote enteral
nutrition in VLBW and ELBW. Aim of the study is to
verify the effects of nutritional changes on several
clinical indicators, confronting 1998-99 and 2003-04
periods.
Methods: All ELBW (group A) and VLBW (group B)
infants consecutively admitted to our NICU in the two-
years period of 1998–99 – newborn under older
nutritional guidelines – and 2003-04 – implemented
guidelines - were included in the study. Significant
changes of policies regarded introduction of human milk
bank, schedule for increasing enteral nutrition and
management of feeding intolerance. A comparison
between the two year-periods was performed inside both
groups A and B. Between two-year periods, as clinical
indicators, we analyzed: Days under parenteral nutrition,
(total and partial), regaining of birthweight, type of
feeding at discharge, growth patterns during
hospitalization (average growth) and at discharge
(weight, length and head circumference), days of
hospitalization, incidence of surgical necrotizing
enterocolitis (NEC). For statistical purposes we used the
c-square test, Student’s t-test and Mann-Whitney test.
Results: Most relevant differences regarded: Days of
hospitalization, gestational age at discharge, days of
parenteral nutrition, average growth during
hospitalization.
Conclusions: Our results confirm literature about
advantages of early enteral nutrition on VLBW and
ELBW. In daily practice positive effects was evident
even for nursing management, money and resource
saving, “care” practices.

Bonn, Bonn, Germany
Background and Aims: Copper, through its role as a
cofactor for lysyl oxidase is essential for cross-links in
collagen and elastin. Studies in copper deficient animals
demonstrated that impaired mechanical strength was
related to defects in the collagen component of the bone
thus facilitating pathological fracturing of the bone.
Methods: We report on a female preterm infant of 25th
week of gestation with multiple spontaneous fractures
most probably due to alimentary copper deficiency.
Results: In the tenth week of life a spontaneous fracture
of the femur developed, shortly afterwards multiple
fractures of both upper and lower limbs were observed.
After exclusion of vitamin D deficiency as well as close
observation of calcium/phosphate metabolism low
copper levels (5.6μmol/l normal range 5.0-11.6μmol/l)
and ceruloplasmin levels (0.084g/l, normal range 0.15-
0.56g/l) were detectable. Radiological findings showed
no evidence of osteogenesis imperfecta but signs
compatible to copper deficiency. At this time the infant
was fed with a copper depleted formula because of
severe cholestasis. After augmented substitution of
- 277 -
copper, no more fractures occurred and bone changes
regressed.
Conclusions: Apart from a central position in the
collagen metabolism copper is required for the function
of at least 30 more proteins including superoxide
dismutase, cytochrome C oxidase, tyrosinase and
dopamine-beta-hydroxylase. As sufficient copper stores
are established only in the last period of gestation very
premature infants are at risk for copper deficiency
leading to impaired mechanical strength of the
developing bones. In severe osteopenia of prematurity
copper deficiency should be considered in the
differential diagnosis.

Department of Neonatology, Special Hospital of
Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Skopje, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Newborns with intrauterine
growth restriction, because of placental insufitiention
and chronic hypoxia, have high risk for asphyxia and
other pathological conditions. Aim of the study is to
establish perinatal morbidity of full term IUGR babies,
by analysis of frequency of perinatal asphyxia,
meconium aspiration syndroma (MAS) and hypooxic-
ishemic encephalopathy (HIE).
Methods: 3190 liveborn have been analysed in the
study, born in 2004, in SHGO-Cair, Skopje. Full term
IUGR babies are 282 (8,8%), and full term babies with
normal fetal growth are 2764 (77,2%). Computer data
and neonatal histories data have been analysed.
Results: Perinatal morbidity has been analysed up to
appearance of asphyxia, MAS and HIE. Full term IUGR
babies have higher frequency of these conditions in
contrasting to normal growth babies: 1. Asphyxia at 7
(2,48%) babies vs. 36 (1,3%); 2. MAS at 2 (0,7%)
babies vs. 10 (0,36%); 3. HIE at 2 (0,70%) vs. 8
(0,28%).
Conclusions: Full term IUGR babies have higher
frequency of pathological conditions like asphyxia,
MAS and HIE in contrasting to full term babies with
normal fetal growth. To prevent these conditions, there
is need for introducing an adequate antenatal and
intrapartal management, by: antenatal screening for fetal
growth restriction, early detection of fetal distress,
pregnancy interruption in the cases where is necessary
and adequate neonatal resuscitation.

Portugal
Background and Aims: The hepatitis A vaccine is
available in Portugal, but not worldwide. The prevalence
of this infection is decreasing in developed countries but
outbreaks can occur, usually among socio-economic
deprived groups like gipsy communities. Objectives: To
evaluate the development of a hepatitis A outbreak and
the preventive measures taken to its control.
Methods: The prevention procedures carried out
between the identification of the index case and the end
of the outbreak were analysed.
Results: Hepatitis A virus infection (HAV) was
identified in 7 gipsy children aged between 3 and 11
years-old, between October and December 2005. Some
of these children were members of the same family and
others attended the same school in a suburban
neighbourhood of Lisbon. After the alert launched by
the hospital, the local health authorities started a
community intervention with the involvement of Town
Hall, local schools and a non-governmental agency. In
January 2006 a vaccination programme was initiated in
the gipsy community and in the local school. The
programme occurred in 3 stages because 1 new case was
found after the first stage and other case after the
second. In the local school, HAV vaccines were given to
71 (100%) children and 14 (78%) employees. In the
community 197 (71%) children were vaccinated. The
global coverage was 79%. The outbreak was
successfully controlled.
Conclusions: The notification of some infectious
diseases like HAV infection is obligatory in Portugal.
This is very important in public health because it can
allow fast and effective measures to outbreak control.
ROTAVIRUS ACUTE GASTROENTERITIS:
CLINICAL BURDEN AND PREDICTORS OF
SEVERITY IN A PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY
DEPARTMENT

L Da Dalt
Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova,
Padova, Italy
Background and Aims: Rotavirus gastroenteritis still
causes clinical and social burden in all developed
countries, but Italian epidemiological data are old and
inaccurate. Our aims therefore were to evaluate the
impact of acute gastroenteritis in children <5 years, in
terms of access to a Pediatric Emergency Department
(PED) and hospitalization; to compare epidemiologic
and clinical characteristics of rotavirus related
gastroenteritis to those caused by other pathogens.
Methods: This is a one-year prospective observational
study, including children <5 years, admitted with
community acquired gastroenteritis to our PED.
Demographic, clinical, socio-economical data were
collected; rotavirus was detected by an
immunocromatographic rapid stool test. We performed
descriptive two-variable analyses to compare rotavirus
and non-rotavirus gastroenteritis and a multiple logistic
regression for predictors of hospitalization.
Results: Annual access rate to our PED due to acute
gastroenteritis resulted 4.1/100 inhabitants <5y; 46,9%
of them were infected by rotavirus. Annual rate of
- 278 -
hospitalization was 5,2/1000, with rotaviral positivity of
56%. In comparison to other pathogens, rotaviral
infection was associated with higher clinical severity
(number of daily diarrheic episodes, number of
vomiting, level of fever, severity of dehydration,
metabolic acidosis, ketonuria). At the multi-variable
analysis, predictors of hospitalization resulted age < 3
months (OR=70.89) and presence of moderate-severe
dehydration (OR=3.87).
Conclusions: In our area rotavirus gastroenteritis
represents an important cause of admission to PED and
of hospitalization, with higher severity in respect to
other pathogens. These results can be useful in planning
strategies of prevention and of active immunization.

Department of Pediatrics, Thriasion General Hospital,
Athens, Greece
Background and Aims: Measles continues to be a
menace to millions of children worldwide. Currently,
the World Health Organization (WHO) has set up a
number of programs to reduce measles mortality
worldwide by 50% by the end of 2005. The last 25 years
4 major outbreaks of measles occurred in Greece, last
being on 1996. In late November 2005 a cluster of
confirmed measles cases was reported among preschool
children in North of Greece.
Methods: This abstract describes an outbreak, 3 months
later in West Athens (South Greece) and examines the
characteristics of the children affected, with particular
reference to immunisation history and socioeconomic
status.
Results: From February 2006 to April 2006, 30 cases
were diagnosed in our hospital. 40% of all cases were
aged under 12 months, 90% were 5 years or under. All
cases had no record of receiving any measles vaccine.
All children were from a racial/ethnic minority
(gypsies), having parents with low educational status,
and belonging to a very poor household. Serological
analysis (measles specific IgM) was carried out on 10
patients blood samples. Urinary and saliva samples of
these patients were also tested for measles virus by
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. (RT-
PCR). 30% of cases needed hospitalisation.1% were
transferred to a Paediatric Infectious Disease
Department.
Conclusions: Unvaccinated children are clustered
geographically and socioeconomically. Greece needs to
reach the WHO objective of measles elimination by
2010 and the interventions need to be specifically
designed and targeted toward racial/ethnic minorities
who choose for their children not to receive any
vaccinations.

Background and Aims: Intra familial pathway has
been considered as an important way for person-to-
person transmission of H. pylori infection. However,
very few studies involved all household members into
study population. The present study aimed at
investigating the relationship between H. pylori
infection in children and the other household members.
Methods: This community-based cross-sectional study
was carried out on 533 participants from 135 households
with multiple generations living in the same household.
Results: H. pylori infection in children was found
significantly associated with the infection in mothers
[OR (95% CI): 2.50 (1.19 - 5.26)], even after being
adjusted for sex, age group and sibling number [adjusted
OR (95% CI): 2.47 (1.12 - 5.47)]. It was also
significantly associated with the infection in both
parents [adjusted OR (95% CI): 4.14 (1.29 - 13.23)]. No
significant association between H. pylori infection in the
father, grandparent(s), uncle or aunt with that in their
children was found.
Conclusions: Results from the present study showed
intra familial transmission in a multi-generation
population and supported the hypothesis of person-to-
person transmission of H. pylori infection.

Background and Aims: This presentation describes the
epidemiology, clinical course and outcome of children
admitted to a tertiary paediatric intensive care unit
(PICU) with Meningococcal disease (MD). Temporal
trends are explored and three predictors of survival are
compared.
Methods: Retrospective case note analysis of all PICU
admissions diagnosed clinically with MD. Data
collected: demographics, mortality prediction scores,
treatment, and outcome.
- 279 -
Results: Between 1997 and 2005 the PICU admitted
106 children with MD. The median age was 2.5 years.
Fifty-four percent of admissions were male. There were
6 deaths, (mortality 5.7%). Detailed information was
available for 102 patients. Of these, 17 suffered
predominantly meningitis and 79 predominantly
septicaemia, 6 had mixed disease. Ninety-two children
required mechanical ventilation, 74 required inotropes
and 14 required haemofiltration. Eighty-four percent of
survivors had no lasting morbidity. Compared to the
group that died or survived with disability, intact
survivors had significantly lower mean (SD) PRISM
score 11.9 (6.5) vs. 19.9 (8.2), p< 0.001, Glasgow
Meningococcal Septicaemia Prognostic (GMSP) score
5.4 (2.7) vs. 8.2 (3.6), p<0.001 and Platelet-Neutrophil
product 2,156 (2,038) vs. 884 (1,133), p <0.01.
Referrals from within the hospital had lower mean
PRISM 9.4 (6.7) compared to outside referrals PRISM
15.1 (7.4), p<0.001. Logistic regression proved PRISM
best predicted survival in the group as a whole, although
GMSP best predicted survival of meningitis.
Conclusions: Increasingly, due to centralisation of MD
care, patients referred to PICU have poorer prognostic
scores and require more intensive treatment. Prognostic
scores are useful but should reflect the disease process
to which they are applied.

Background and Aims: Two new vaccines against
rotavirus (RV) infection will be available in Belgium
later this year. Both are very effective in reducing the
rate of serious rotavirus gastroenteritis and associated
hospitalisations. In Belgium no official data are
available about the burden from rotavirus disease. The
data from the last three rotavirus gastroenteritis seasons
in our department were retrospectively analysed.
Methods: All stool samples, sent to our clinical
microbiology laboratory between June 2002 and June
2005 for the detection of RV were taken into account:
Result (positive/negative), date of sample, age of the
patient, hospitalisation characteristics.
Results: see fig 1
Conclusions: National data are necessary to calculate
the health profit and financial repercussion of the
introduction of a vaccine against rotavirus. The results
will depend on the vaccination schedule and the vaccine
coverage. If the vaccine protects almost totally against
hospitalisation, a substantial reduction in hospitalisation
days can be expected for most pediatric wards.

University of Patras, Patras, Greece
Background and Aims: To study the demographic and
epidemiologic data of aseptic meningitis in the
childhood population of Achaia, a prefecture of Western
Greece during the last five years.
Methods: Children (age < 14 years) with aseptic
meningitis admitted to the Pediatric Clinic and/or
reported to the regional Department of Health from
1/1/01-31/12/2005 and coming from Achaia were
included in the study. The demographic and
epidemiologic data were analysed. Diagnosis was based
on clinical picture, elevated CSF white cells with
lymphocyte predominate and negative CSF and blood
culture. No patient received antibiotic treatment.
Results: During 2001 to 2005 there were 115 (48.7%)
patients with aseptic meningitis among the 236
meningitis patients. Seventy-five (65.2%) of them were
males and 40 (34.8%) females. The mean age of the
patients was 7.55 + 3.95 (range 0.08 to 14) years. Fifty
patients (43.5%) were recorded during the summer and
44 (38.3%) during the spring. Exacerbations of the
disease were observed during 2001; there were recorded
80 (69.6%) cases. The annual incidence of the disease
per 100000 children was 39.5, while during the
exacerbation-period of 2001 reached 137.8. Complete
recovery without complications occurred in all patients.
Conclusions: Aseptic meningitis is common during
summer and spring. The annual incidence during the last
five years was 39.5 with exacerbation occurring during
2001. The disease affects young children, more often
males than females. The course was favourable in all
cases.

Background and Aims: In an earlier study it was
established that during the decade 1991 to 2000
bacterial meningitis was rare in rural areas of W.
Greece. This study was conducted in order to investigate
if the incidence of bacterial meningitis in children
during 2001 to 2005 continues to remain low in rural
regions and high in urban and suburban settings in the
same areas of W. Greece.
Methods: Included were all children with proven or
suspected bacterial meningitis in W. Greece from 2001
to 2005. There were 42 children with proven and 79
children with suspected bacterial meningitis. All cases
of proven or suspected bacterial meningitis had
pleiocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid with
predominance of polymorphonuclear leucocytes and
compatible clinical picture. Proven bacterial meningitis
fulfilled in addition one or more of the following
criteria: (a) positive blood/CSF culture, (b) positive
Gram stain or latex agglutination.
Results: The annual incidence of proven bacterial
meningitis was 1.95 (38 cases) per 10,000 children in
urban areas, 1.92 (2 cases) in suburban and 0.23 (2
cases) in rural areas. In cases of suspected bacterial
meningitis the incidence per 10,000 children was 3.39
(66 cases), 7.69 (8 cases) and 0.58 (5 cases),
respectively. Only two of the 38 cases of Haemophilus
influenzae type b, Neisseria meningitidis or
Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis came from rural
areas.
Conclusions: Children living in rural areas continue to
be spared from bacterial meningitis compared to those
living in urban and suburban regions, since bacterial
meningitis appeared extremely rare in the rural settings.

Background and Aims: Bacterial infection is common
among very low birth weigh (VLBW) infants as a
consequence of weak immune system. In this study an
analysis of infections in the intensive care nursery of the
Shiraz Nemazi hospital was made over a two year
period.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study the data were
extracted from files of 416 infants admitted in nursery of
the Shiraz Nemazi hospital during a two year period
(2002-2003). The frequencies of different infections,
prevalent isolated bacteria along with their demographic
data were analyzed.
Results: Among 416 VLBW infants 262 (63%) were
male and 154 (37%) were female. The most prevalent
infections were pulmonary and gastrointestinal
infections. The mean hospitalization time was 7 days
with the range of 1-64 days and the mean age of
infection was 5 days with the range of 1-30 days. 19.2%
of infants diagnosed to be suffered from infection and
79.8% from other non-infectious diseases. The most
frequent microbes isolated were: Escherichia coli 9.1%,
Acenitobacter spp 7.7%, Kelebsiella spp 4.8%,
Pseudomonas Spp 4.3%, Staphylococcus aureus 3.4%,
Candida albicans 1.9%, Staphylococcus epidermidis
1.6%, Streptococcus faecalis 1.4% and Enetrobacter spp
1.1%.
Conclusions: This study confirms the necessity of
expanding management programs for prevention of
nosocomial infections, improving sampling and
microbial isolation procedures and precise clinical
diagnosis.

Atención Medica, Instituto Pedro Kourí, Hospital
Ciudad de la Habana, Ciudad de la Habana, Cuba
Background and Aims: Since 1986 a controlled
program is established in primary health care in Cuba to
reduce vertical transmission.
Methods: Each HIV+ pregnant woman who decides to
keep her pregnant receive ZDV; 600 mg daily from
week 14 to 38 when Caesarean operation is carried out.
During his first 6 weeks, the child receives AZT
(2mg/Kg/dose) every 6 hours. Evolution of these
children is made in IPK external office, where they are
studied to determine HIV infection Infected children are
treated with antiretrovirals, according to opportunistic
diseases, CD4 and viral load. Quantification of CD4 is
determined by flow cytometry, using a FACScan
cytometer from Becton Dickinson. Quantification of
viral RNA levels was made through the Nuclisens
system from Biomerieux.
Results: A total of 1386 seropositive women have been
reported since January 1, 1986 to February 28, 2006 (18,
6%) of all the seropositive cases of the country (1386/
7109), 216 (15,5%) have given birth a total of 233
children (15 women have delivered twice and 2 have
twins); 26 of 233 are HIV+ (11,1%), 22 classified as
AIDS (22/26=84,6%), 13 are under treatment with
HAART; 9 (9/26=34,6%) died and 4 are asymptomatic.
No infection was demonstrated in 126 children by PCR
and Western Blot (126/233=54,0%) and 78 (78/233=33,
4%) are still under study.
Conclusions: The program and prevention and control
of vertical transmission is effective as the amount of
infected children is low similar to that developed
countries.
IMMUNIZATION STATUS REGARDING
HEPATITIS B OF CHILDREN 2 TO 6 Y. O. IN
THE ISLAND OF THERA, GREECE
S S Katinakis, M Triantafyllou
Department of Pediatrics, Thera Health Center, Thera,
Greece
Background and Aims: Immunizations are vital for the
prevention of infections in pediatrics. Aim of this study
was to determine the immunization status of children 2
to 6 years of age regarding Hepatitis B, in the Greek
island of Thera (Santorini).
- 281 -
Methods: Data were collected from the immunization
records of 591 children (304 boys and 287 girls) (332
Greek) aged 2 to 6 years, who were examined for
various reasons at the public Health Center of Thera,
during a period of 6 months (1-11-2005 to 30-4-2006).
Fully immunized were considered the children who had
received three doses of the vaccine with at least 6
months interval between the first and the third dose.
Results: 96.6% of the children were fully immunized,
2.8% were incompletely immunized and only 0.7% had
not received any dose of Hepatitis B vaccine. Among
the Greek children, 97.3% were fully immunized, while
the foreign children were fully immunized at a 95.3%
rate. Most children lacking doses of vaccination were
among the younger ones, which shows that they were
just neglecting to follow the vaccination schedule
strictly, while 2 out of the 4 unimmunized children had
parents who refused to vaccinate their children as a
principle.
Conclusions: In the island of Thera, Hepatitis B
immunization is carried out at a satisfactory rate and we
are contented with the compliance of the people, both
Greek and foreign.

Background and Aims: Breastfeeding is well known to
affect neonatal and infantile colonization by
microorganisms. Nasal carriage of Staphylococcus
aureus is a risk factor for invasive disease. The aim of
the study was to assess the protective role of
breastfeeding on the nasal carriage of S. aureus.
Methods: We conducted a prospective community-
based study of breastfeeding in Crete, Greece. A
randomised sample of 1049 pairs (mother-infant) was
formed. The epidemiology of staphylococcal carriage
was examined for 62 healthy infants (31 fully, 17
partially breast-fed and 14 bottle fed) at six months after
birth.
Results: Among the 31 exclusively breast-fed infants, 9
were colonized by S. aureus strains, of whom 3 were
methicillin-resistant. Among the 31 partially breast-fed
or bottle-fed infants, 7 were colonized by S. aureus
strains, of whom 6 were methicillin-resistant. Exclusive
breastfeeding was associated with somehow higher rates
of S. aureus carriage (odds ratio 1.40; 95% confidence
intervals 0.45 to 4.41), however MRSA carriage was
higher among partially breast-fed and bottle-fed infants
than in their exclusively breast-fed peers (odds ratio
2.24; 95% confidence intervals 0.51 to 9.91).
Conclusions: The findings of this small cohort suggest
that exclusively breast-fed infants, although equally or
even more often colonized by S. aureus, present with
decreased frequency of methicillin-resistant strains.
Larger cohorts are required to demonstrate this
protective effect of breastfeeding, if any.
MORBIDITY OF DISEASE WHO ARE LIABLE
TO REGULAR VACCINATION IN A PERIOD OF
TEN YEARS
R A Brezovska
Pediatrics Medical Center, Gostivar, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Review of the representation
of contagious diseases that are liable to regular
vaccination in Gostivar. Review of morbidity of
Varicelae that is not liable to obligatory vaccine and
observe the effects of vaccination and the need to bring
regular vaccination for Varicelae.
Methods: In R. Macedonia is conducting obligatory
vaccination against: TBC Morbili, Rubeola, Parotitis
Epidemica, Diptheria, Tetanus, Pertusis, Poliomielitis,
and not for Varicelae. Against Hepatitis B the
vaccination is obligatory from November 2005. To
elaborate the material the facts were taken from monthly
reports and reporting lists of sick people in period from
1996 until 2005. The city of Gostivar has around
110.000 people from mixed national and social structure
and the morbidity we get from formula.
Results: The contagious diseases which are obligate for
vaccination have very low morbidity and that is for high
surround of 95% vaccined people. In 2005 there is
appearance of Parotitis in epidemic form on people born
in 1990-93. That is for low vaccination from 35%
because of lack of vaccine against Parotitis from
independence of the state. There has not been ill people
from Poliomielitis and Diptheria, but 2 people died from
Tetanus in 2003 and 2005. There is high morbidity from
Varicelae 250 cases in year of children until 7 years old
but also there is cases of adults.
Conclusions: With vaccination successfully are
prevented contagious diseases. Considering the fact that
high morbidity from Varicelae especially in early child
age is necessary to bring in continuer vaccination
against Varicelae.

Background and Aims: The aim of this study was to
determine the molecular epidemiology and incidence of
pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae during
a 5 years period.
Methods: Retrospective study including patients aged
< 19 years old with clinical diagnosis of pneumonia or
empyema with S.pneumoniae isolated by culture from
2000 to 2005. Annual incidence rates were calculated
per 100,000 children < 19 years old from Health Area of
- 282 -
our center. Serotype and Multi Locus Sequence Typing
(MLST) was made to a subset of strains. Pre-PCV7
period was defined as 2000-2002 and the post-PCV7
was defined as 2003-2005.
Results: A total of 48 episodes of pneumococcal
pneumonia were identified in 47 patients, mean age
3,8y. Strains were recovered from blood (17), pleural
efussions (25), both (2) and bronchoalveolar lavage (4).
Annual incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia
increased from 2,4 per 100.000 children during pre-
PCV7 period to 5,9 episodes per 100.000 during post-
vacunal period. Most frequent serotypes were serotype 1
(12 cases), 14 (10 cases), 5 (5 cases) and 19A (5 cases).
Strains serotype distribution varied between first period
and second: 7-valent vaccine serotypes (7VS) (45,5%
vs. 25,7%), vaccine-related (7VRS) (18,2% vs. 20%)
and non-vaccine serotypes (7NVS) (36,4% vs 54,3%).
MLST performed showed that the majority of serotype
1s were of known serotype 1 sequence types (ST 306
and ST 304).
Conclusions: The increase of pneumonia and empyema
in our area may be associated with infection due to non-
vaccine serotypes. Serotype 1 clones may be related to
this fact.

Background and Aims: Describe the physicians' and
parents' opinions about the chicken pox vaccination.
Methods: Cross sectional pharmaco-epidemiological
study conducted in three European countries (France,
Italy, Germany) with the same protocol including a
physician opinion questionnaire, a clinical form
describing the vaccine and a parents' self administered
questionnaire.
Results: 186 French, 509 German and 170 Italian
paediatricians have participated to the study and
respectively 878 French, 2380 German and 182 Italian
patients. Among the paediatricians involved,
respectively 52.2%, 67.7% and 39.0% systematically
recommended chickenpox vaccination for children and
estimate that 56.2%, 70.3%, 63.6% of parents accept it.
Among those who accepted, the most relevant
arguments in convincing them are: The availability of an
effective and well-tolerated vaccine (78.7%, 78.7%,
77,7%) and information on the seriousness of the
disease (67,8%, 77.4%, 73,5%). Paediatricians indicate
that the main reasons why parents refuse are the
perception that chickenpox is a harmless disease
(82.6%, 88.1%, 51.0%). A sub-analysis of parents who
were initially reluctant showed that refusal was
essentially due to the fear of vaccine complications
(57.6%, 58.8%, 92.9%) as well as the increasing number
of vaccinations (37.5%, 45.4%, 42.9%). 22.5%, 25.0%
and 36.1% of the practitioners administered chickenpox
vaccine at the same time than MMR vaccine. For some
parents, acceptance could potentially be enhanced by the
co-administration of varicella vaccine with MMR.
Conclusions: In the three European countries parents
readily accept chickenpox vaccination when the
practitioner recommends it and/or when they are
appropriately informed both about the potential severity
of varicella disease and the safety of the vaccine.

St. Orsola-Malpighi General Hospital, University of
Bologna, Bologna, Italy
Background and Aims: Paediatric HIV infection is
mainly the consequence of perinatal transmission. Since
1994 has been adopted antiviral-prophylaxis in the
mothers and in the newborns (P076). In developed
countries, these measures associated with cesarean
delivery have reduced the transmission rate from 36% to
2%.
Methods: We conduced a retrospective study from 1985
to 2005 in St. Orsola Hospital to evaluate the different
incidence of HIV perinatal transmission.
Results: During the study period 173 HIV-seropositive
women delivered 194 newborns. 88% came from Italy
and 50% acquired infection from drug abuse. After 2002
the source of infection changed; most women acquired
HIV sexually. 37% of mothers were co-infected with
HCV. After 1996, 82% of the women completed
antiviral-prophylaxis during the prenatal and intra-
partum period, as did 89% of newborns. 2 babies had
low birth weight (<1500gr), and 2 babies were less than
30 weeks of GA. HIV infection was diagnosed in 17
newborns (8.7%). Since 1997 there have been 5 cases of
infected children; in four cases the mother was not
treated during pregnancy and labour while all the babies
underwent a correct prophylaxis.
Conclusions: 1) the number of mothers treated with
antiviral prophylaxis during pregnancy and labour
progressively and significantly increased (8% after 1996
vs 21% before 1996). 2) Also the number of
newborns with completed antiviral prophylaxis
significantly increased (89% after 1996 vs 29% before
1996) 3) Consequent cumulative incidence decreased
with the implementation of guidelines: after 1995 only 5
babies infected/ 85 babies at risk (5.9%), before 1995 12
infected/ 109 babies at risk (11%).

2. With complete and aggressive treatment of giardia the
risk of hepatitis B virus is reduced.
- 283 -
Methods: This problem is completed inquired and is
continued from text book especially pharmacology,
immunology, pathology.
Results: We will have to be serious with Jiardia
infection and taking medicine in this infection should be
totally completed. When Jiardia infection is eradicated,
the risk of infection with hepatitis B is decreased.
Conclusions: Giardia have symbiosis with hepatitis B
virus. The risk for other is decreased, when one of them
is cured. Jiardia vs symbiosis with hepatitis B virus.
This problem is cleared ours and we can prove it.

Pediatric Critical Care Unit, Hospital Sant Joan de
Deu, Barcelona, Spain
Background and Aims: About 15-20% of infants with
bronchiolitis are admitted at PICU, and 30-40% of these
cases become mechanical ventilated. To analyze
bronchiolitis ventilatory support characteristics, the last
years.
Methods: Prospective and observational study from
infants with bronchiolitis admitted at PICU during 2004-
2005. We compared data obtained with 2002-03 period.
Results: Data from 72 patients were collected. 45 were
male (62.5%) with a mean age of 1.93 months
(SD±2.69). In the 34.7% of cases, risk factors for
bronchiolitis were found. Almost one quarter were
premature at birth, whom 6 received specific anti
Respiratory Syncitial Virus (RSV) antibodies. RSV was
positive in 52.8% of cases, with significant differences
from 2002-03 period (79.2%), p<0.03. Exclusive non-
invasive ventilation with nasal CPAP or BiPAP was
required in 22% of all cases, and 12.5% previous to
intubation. Duration of non-invasive ventilation was 1.9
days range 1-8 days. Mechanical ventilation was
required in 38 cases (52.8%) and high frequency
ventilation was used in two infants. Indication for
mechanical ventilation was respiratory distress in 60%
and apnea in 21.1%. No differences were found regard
ventilation requirements and risk factors, or SRV
diagnosis, nor previous VNI. Mean stay in PICU was
5.3 days (SD±4.94). Including gravity score, all results
were comparable with 2002-2003. Last period active
humidification was systematically used, the time on
mechanical ventilation was lower but without
statistically different (5.13 versus 6.8).
Conclusions: Non-invasive ventilotherapy is useful in
bronchiolitis. Decreases in duration of mechanical
ventilation may be related to the systematic use of
humidification.

Hospital, Salford, UK
Background and Aims: Preterm infants with variable
lung compliance are at risk of volume induced lung
injury. Volume controlled ventilation (VCV) differs
from pressure limited ventilation (PLV) in terms of gas
delivery target, which is tidal volume in VCV rather
than pressure in PLV. This study was planned to
compare the efficacy and safety of VCV to PLV in very
premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome
(RDS) requiring mechanical ventilation.
Methods: 109 newborns weighing 600-1500 g and
24-32 weeks gestation with RDS were randomized to
either VCV or PLV, and treated with a standardized
protocol. The two modalities were compared by
determining the time required to achieve pre-determined
'success' criteria, based on either the Alveolar-arterial
oxygen gradient [<13 kPa] or the mean airway pressure
[< 8 cm H2O]. Analysis was done on an intention to
treat basis.
Results: Out of 109 babies enrolled, there were 57 in
the VCV group and 52 in the PLV group. Mean time to
reach success criteria was 23 hrs in VCV group
compared to 33 hrs in PLV (p=0.15). However this
difference between VCV and PLV was more striking in
babies weighing less than 1000g (21 vs. 58 hrs; p=0.03)
and amongst those who had moderate to severe
respiratory failure (27 vs 59 hrs; p=0.03) respectively.
There were 5 deaths in the VCV group and 10 in PLV
(p=0.10). The incidence of other complications was
similar in two groups.
Conclusions: VCV is safe and efficacious in extremely
low birth weight infants and may have advantages over
traditional methods of ventilation.

Health System, Ann Arbor, MI, USA
Background and Aims: Pressure Support Ventilation
(PSV) is a patient-triggered, pressure-limited, flow-
cycled mode of ventilation which provides an
inspiratory “pressure boost” during spontaneous
breathing. This study was planned to evaluate the effect
of varying levels of pressure support with synchronized
intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV). Methods:
In randomized crossover trial, breath-to-breath
pulmonary mechanics data were collected from 10
premature infants during three modes of ventilation -
SIMV alone, SIMV with partial PSV, and SIMV with
full PSV. Full PSV provided 5-8 ml/kg and Partial PSV
2.5-4 ml/kg of expired Tidal volume (Vte). Results: A
total of 19,112 breaths were analysed. The Minute
Ventilation (Ve) and Respiratory Rate (RR) improved
with the addition of pressure support
(Table 1). Conclusions: Pressure Support Ventilation
improves the efficiency of breathing during mechanical
- 284 -
ventilation and the improvement is proportional to the
level of support provided.

Background and Aims: Invasive mechanical
ventilation impairs cardiac output in children and adults.
N-CPAP is widely used in neonatal intensive care, as
yet, hemodynamic consequences have not been
investigated.
Methods: A prospective study to assess the
hemodynamic effects has been conducted in 21 preterm
babies (8 males, 13 females) < 1500g by two-
dimensional M-mode and pulsed Doppler
echocardiography during and one hour after
discontinuation of n-CPAP.
Results: Gestational age was 28.0 ± 1.9 weeks
(mean±SD), birth weight 1000 ± 238 g, age at study
entry 200 ± 155 hours, total maintenance fluid 154 ± 42
mL/kg/day, level of n-CPAP was 4.4 ± 0.9 cmH2O.
None of the babies received inotropic support. N-CPAP
did not cause any significant difference in any
parameters measured (Wilcoxon Test): stroke volume
3.1 ± 1.0 mL (without n-CPAP) vs. 3.1 ± 1.0 mL (with
n-CPAP), cardiac output 500 ± 176 mL/min vs. 487 ±
156 mL/min, left ventricular diastolic diameter 1.24 ±
0.14 cm vs. 1.22 ± 0.15 cm, fractional shortening 0.29 ±
0.04% vs. 0.30 ± 0.05%, aortic velocity-time integral
8.70 ± 1.65 cm vs. 8.64 ± 1.80 cm. Level of n-CPAP did
not influence cardiac output (Kruskal-Wallis).
Conclusions: N-CPAP (up to 7 cmH2O) has no
hemodynamic effect in preterm babies. Our data imply
that there is no need to withhold n-CPAP support in
order to avoid circulatory compromise in small preterm
babies.

Background and Aims: The acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory process which
develops following a multitude of direct or indirect lung
insults, manifested by refractory hypoxemia and
respiratory failure, still associated with high morbidity
and mortality rates. The aim of this study was to
investigate the incidence, predisposing factors, clinical
course, management and outcomes in children with
ARDS, and to identify variables related with higher
mortality.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records
of all children discharged with the diagnosis of ARDS in
our tertiary paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), from
2001 to 2005. Those who met the American-European
Consensus definition criteria of ARDS were included.
Results: Twenty-nine children were identified as having
ARDS, representing 2.7% of all PICU admission.
Median age (interquartile range) was 29 months
(14-60.5). The most common predisposing factors were
sepsis/septic shock (34,5%) and pneumonia (34.5%).
The mean values SD) of PaO2/FiO2, oxygenation
index and A-aDO2 on the 1st 24h were 85.3 29.1,
26.9 11.0 and 490.7 109.3, respectively. The means
values SD) of maximal peak inspiratory pressure
(PIP), airway median pressure (MAP) and positive end-
expiratory pressure (PEEP) were 38.9 5.8, 20.6 4.5 and
7.98 2.5 cmH2O, respectively. Mortality rate was
34.5% (n=10). Duration of PICU´s stay and ventilator
treatment was shorter for nonsurvivors (p<0.05).
Conclusions: There were no significant differences in
respiratory parameters between survivors and
nonsurvivors. We speculate that early mortality is more
related to the severity of the underlying disease than
with the respiratory failure itself.
HELIOX IN PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY AND
CRITICAL CARE SETTING
A Deep, M Choudhary, P Habibi
PICU, St. Mary's Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: Heliox-21 has a lower density
than air which allows movement of gas with less driving
pressure and better ventilation down to the alveolar level
Methods: Cases managed with heliox in emergency
department and PICU of a tertiary care hospital.
Results: Heliox in Post-Extubation Stridor: A 10 month
old infant was admitted with respiratory failure.
Following extubation she developed stridor and was
treated with heliox-21. Patient rapidly settled following
heliox-21 therapy, stridor score decreased to 4/11 from
9/11 and after 5 hours heliox-21 was stopped. Patient
required only 1 dose of nebulised adrenaline and heliox-
21 was used as the driving gas at a flow rate of 12 l/min.
Heliox in Asthma: A 2 year old was admitted with an
acute asthma Wood's asthma score was 7/10. He was on
high doses of salbutamol and aminophylline. He was
started on heliox-21 and after 20 minutes there was an
improvement in clinical condition. and reduction in
asthma severity score to 4/10. Heliox-21 therapy was
continued for 6 hours, requirements for bronchodilators
decreased and he did not require ventilation. Heliox in
Croup: 2 year old girl presented with marked respiratory
distress. Stridor score on admission was 7/11 and
- 285 -
heliox-21 was commenced immediately in A&E. There
was increase in saturation to 94% within 10 minutes of
starting heliox-21. Stridor score fell to zero after 7 hours
of starting heliox and the patient did not require further
adrenaline nebulisers.
Conclusions: It has a potential for use as 1st line for
many respiratory conditions in children averting need
for PICU.
SURFACTANT INSTILLATION VIA
BRONCHOSCOPY IN PRETERM INFANTS
WITH RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME

Neonatal and Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Major
City Hospital, Verona, Italy
Background and Aims: Surfactant therapy is widely
used in newborn infants with respiratory distress
syndrome (RDS). As a rescue treatment, it generally
requires tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.
We investigated the safety and efficacy of surfactant
instillation through a fiberoptic bronchoscope, thus
avoiding intubation.
Methods: Preterm newborns (< 36 weeks GA) with
RDS, requiring nasal CPAP and FiO2 > 30% to
maintain SatO2 > 92%, were eligible for the study.
After topical anaesthesia (1% lidocaine) and mild
sedation (midazolam 0.1 mg.kg-1), a fiberoptic
endoscope with operative channel (Wolf 2.5 mm, Pentax
3.5 mm) was inserted into the trachea. 200 mg. kg-1 of
natural surfactant (Curosurf®, Chiesi) were directly
instilled into the airway. Immediately after instillation, a
short course of manual bagging was provided, in order
to favour a better distribution of surfactant. Parental
informed consent and approval by the local review
committee were obtained.
Results: 13 newborns (6 male) with RDS were enrolled
in a 24-month period. Median weight and gestational
age (range) were 1470 g (770-2360) and 31 GA (24-34).
The procedure was well tolerated and no complications
were observed. In two patients the procedure was briefly
interrupted due to mild desaturation episodes. All
infants showed a prompt improvement of oxygenation,
respiratory distress and radiological findings. 10/13
patients were subsequently managed without the need of
tracheal intubation.
Conclusions: We suggest direct instillation of surfactant
via bronchoscopy is a feasible, safe and effective
technique in newborns with moderate RDS. Larger
controlled studies are needed to compare this method
with the standard administration by tracheal intubation.

M L Franco, B Bernardo, E Zamora, S Marin,
C López Menchero, V Perez Sheriff
Department of Pediatrics, Hospital General
Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, Spain
Background and Aims: Synchronized nasal ventilation
(SNIPPV) could be a useful method to prevent in some
situations the need of intubation and minimize the need
for prolonged mechanical ventilation in order to reduce
ventilator-induced trauma and oxygen toxicity. To
analyzed the efficacy and safety of SNIPPV to prevent
intubation in RDS of prematurity. The study was
designed as a preliminary pilot study prior to a
randomized controlled trial.
Methods: Prospective observational study of non
invasive respiratory support in preterm newborns with
RDS, using a flow sensor synchronizing nasal ventilator,
'Giulia'. Initial settings were: PIP limited at 16-17
cmH2O; PEEP 5cmH2O; Ti 0,35s; respiratory
frequency of back-up of 35 rpm; FiO2 adjusted to keep
saturations at 88-92%. We analyzed the need of invasive
mechanical ventilation as failure of SNIPPV, the
incidence of air leak and gastrointestinal side effects.
Results: SNIPPV was used in 8 patients: 6 after
surfactant administration during the first 2 hours of live
and two as a rescue therapy after extubation failure in
nasal-CPAP. The gestational age range from 25 to 34
weeks. Two patients required mechanical ventilation
secondary to increased oxygen requirement. 6 patients
were successfully ventilated during 48 hours. There
were no adverse effects.
Conclusions: SNIPPV using a flow sensor device for
triggering in an assist /control can be used in some
preterms with RDS. The technique is safe and easy to
use. Comments: We are conducting a randomized
controlled trial to compare SNIPPV to n-CPAP to
prevent invasive mechanical ventilation.

Background and Aims: The application of a
continuous distending pressure has been show to have
some benefits in the treatment of preterm infants with
respiratory distress syndrome. To determine if apply
early continuous distending pressure (CPAP) at delivery
prevents intubation and surfactant therapy in preterm
infants and to identify adverse effects associated with
failure of early CPAP therapy.
Methods: Prospective observational study comprising
liveborn infants with birthweight < 1500 g. Exclusion
criteria were respiratory effort absence at birth,
congenital malformations and outdoor delivery. CPAP
was applied with Neopuff® device immediately after
delivery to establish a functional residual capacity,
maintained during transport to the NICU and then
switch to Infant Flow Driver® Nasal CPAP system.
Therapy success was defined as no requirement
endotracheal intubation in the first 72 hours of life.
Results: 32 infants received CPAP at delivery room
(gestational age 28+6 [25 - 33] weeks; birth weight
- 286 -
1190 [894 - 1500] g; 66% male and 34% female). 9
infants (28%) required intubation and surfactant therapy.
The differences between failure and success groups
were: GA, BW, chorioamnionitis prevalence and
antenatal steroids therapy; only GA was statistically
significant (p 0,049). In early CPAP successful group,
none of the infants showed adverse effects as pulmonary
air leak, intraventricular haemorrhage, or retinopathy of
prematurity.
Conclusions: Respiratory support in premature infants
based on early CPAP is a safe method even in extremely
premature infants.

Universitario Gregorio Marañon, Madrid, Spain
Background and Aims: Mechanical ventilation is a
major contributing factor of Chronic Lung Disease of
Infancy (CLD). To evaluate the outcome of preterm
babies with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and to
determine weather the need for conventional ventilation
could be reduced with the use of nasal CPAP from
delivery or the combination of nasal CPAP following
Intubation for surfactant administration and extubation
(INSURE).
Methods: Retrospective study in the NICU of the HGU
'Gregorio Marañón' (January 2004-December 2005) of
all inborn premature infants of less than 32 weeks GA
and RDS. We describe 4 respiratory support groups:
1: Oxygen therapy (nasals prongs), 2: Nasal CPAP from
delivery, 3: INSURE, 4: Early surfactant followed by
mechanical ventilation (> 2 hours). Surfactant was given
when FiO2>30% was reached.
Results: 202 infants were analysed and treated as
follows: Group 1: 49 (24,3%), group 2: 30 (14,9%),
group 3: 47 (23,3%), and group 4: 76 (37,6%). The rate
of air leak was 2%,13,3%, 0%, 22,4% for groups 1, 2, 3
and 4. Mechanical ventilation was initiated in 23,3% of
group 2 and 17% of 3. The rate of CLD: 0%, 6,7%,
8,5%, 34,2% for groups 1, 2, 3 and 4. Significant
differences in the rate of CLD were found when the
diagnostic chorioamnionitis were present (p=0,000
Fisher exact test) and between groups 3 and 4
(p=0,001.). Logistic regression showed that this
significance could not be explained by GA.
Conclusions: Compared with the group of mechanical
ventilation, INSURE was significantly associated to less
BPD, independent of the gestational age.

Fonseca, Amadora, Portugal
Background and Aims: High frequency oscillatory
ventilation (HFOV) is an important advance in the
treatment of children with respiratory distress.
Advantages include less ventilator-induced lung injury
and less incidence of air-leak. Our purpose was to
describe the experience with HFOV (Sensormedics
3100A) in our unit.
Methods: Retrospective study of all children ventilated
in HFOV (January 2002-December 2005). Demographic
data, blood gases, ventilatory parameters and
complications during conventional ventilation (CV) and
HFOV analysed.
Results: Thirty four children ventilated with HFOV,
mean age of 5,2 ± 7,47 months (min 0,3; max 36).
Pneumonia diagnosed in 26, bronchiolitis in 5, ARDS in
15 and MODS in 5. Etiologic agent isolated in 22: VSR
in 9 (26,5%) and adenovirus in 5 (14,7%). Twenty nine
ventilated in CV before HFOV (mean maximum
parameters: PEEP: 6±3,8, PIP: 25±5,6; FiO2: 70±27,
RR: 57,4±5,6. HFOV initiated due to persistent
hypercapnia with respiratory acidosis in 22 (64,7%) and
severe hypoxemia/hypercapnia in 7. Mean maximum
parameters in HFOV were: amplitude: 52±12,6; MAP
19±4,5; frequency 9,7±0,9; FiO2: 74,5±26,2 and a mean
duration of 4,3±4,1 days. Significant improvement in
capilar pH and pCO2 occurred at 1,6,12 and 24h after
HFOV onset. (p<0,05). Nine air-leak syndromes
occurred (7 pneumothorax: 3 occurring in CV and 3
during ventilation with inflating bag). Mortality rate was
32,4%.
Conclusions: HFOV represents an additional option for
acute respiratory failure, facilitating CO2 elimination
and avoiding aggressive conventional ventilation. It
should be used as a protective lung strategy, and not
only as a rescue option. No complications directly
related with it occurring in our study.

PICU, Department of Paediatrics, Hospital Fernando
Fonseca, Amadora, Portugal
Background and Aims: Non-invasive ventilation
(NIV) is being increasingly used in children with acute
respiratory failure, preventing complications associated
with mechanical ventilation. We have recently
introduced NIV for children with acute respiratory
failure. This study describes our experience.
Methods: Prospective study of all patients who
underwent NIV (November 2005 to March 2006).
Demographic data analysed. Heart and respiratory rate,
SaO2, blood gases evaluated before and at 2, 6 12, and
24 hours after NIV.
Results: Thirty five patients included (36 NIV trials).
Mean age 6,3 ± 20,6 months (median: 1; min 0,3; max
120 months). CPAP used in 32 and BiPAP in 4 patients.
Diagnosis: bronchiolitis in 26 (72,3%), pneumonia in 7
(19,4%) patients. Indications for NIV: acute
hypercapnic and hypoxemic respiratory failure (33),
apnea (4), acute exacerbation of pulmonary chronic
disease (3), upper airway obstruction (2). There was a
- 287 -
significant improvement in respiratory and heart rates,
pH, pCO2 at 6, 12 and 24 hours after NIV onset
(p<0,05) (table). Mean duration of NIV was 51,8 ± 40,6
hours. Sedation with chloral hydrate used in 17 (47,2%).
Six patients required conventional mechanical
ventilation. There were no major complications related
with NIV.
Conclusions: NIV can be effective for children and
infants with acute respiratory failure, preventing some
patients from deteriorating and/or from being ventilated.
THE ROLE OF HFOV IN PEDIATRIC
INTENSIVE CARE – AN ANALYSYS OF THE
SITUATION IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC
D Blazek, P Pavlicek, D Hechtova, K Dlask
Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care
Medicine, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech
Republic
Background and Aims: HFOV was introduced to
clinical use in the early eighties and after 1984 first
clinical trials on HFOV ventilation were performed. In
1995 HFOV was approved by FDA as a medical tool for
treating ARDS in children. Since then several ICU in
the Czech Republic uses this ventilatory strategy in
treatment of severe respiratory failure in children.
Methods: We used a general questionaire to investigate
the use of HFOV in treatment of severe respiratory
failure in children in Prague (4 workplaces), Brno,
Olomouc and Ostrava. The age spectrum of patients,
indications for use of HFOV, how early the method was
applied and the efficiency of HFOV were followed. The
data from each workplace were processed and results
compared.
Results: The experience in use of HFOV in treatment of
respiratory failure in the Czech Republic differ. HFOV
is a standart part of nearly all treatment protocols in
neonatal RDS therapy. The use of the method in higher
age groups of patients is slightly different in different
ICU’s.
Conclusions: The use of HFOV in the Czech Republic
is recognised as one of the standards in treatment of
severe respiratory failure. More common is its use in
neonatal RDS therapy; the criteria, timing and indication
of this method in treatment of ALI/ARDS in higher age
groups are not in general agreement/united.
HOME-BASED PULMONARY VENTILATION –

Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care
Medicine, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech
Republic
Background and Aims: There has been a dramatic
progress in the artificial lung ventilation since its origins
in the fifties. The application of the newest technical
discoveries enabled to develop ventilators providing not
only the basic lung ventilation but also allowing for a
significant comfort to the patient during
prolonged periods of the ventilation. The development
of his type of respirators represented the beginning of
the era of home-based ventilation.
Methods: The transition from hospital-based to home-
based ventilation required to address economic, medical,
technical and psychosocial aspects. The centers for
education and training of the patient's family members
have been formed in the large state and university
hospitals.
Results: It was shown that: a) HCV is more economic
than long term hospitalization. b) HCV represents a
significant improvement in the quality of life of a
chronically ventilated patient. The program of home
care ventilation is being developed in the Czech
Republic for last seven years. Our PICU program
involves currently five permanet patients and many
others are beeing enrolled all over the Czech Republic.
The most common diagnosis are neuromuscular
disorders, cystic fibrosis, sleep apnea syndrom and
deformities of the skeleton, posttraumatic spinal chord
lesion etc.
Conclusions: The program of the HCV is developing
succesfully. We have overcame the initial
legislative and funding problems. The HCV became an
accepted trend in the Czech Republic and its importance
is due to all advantages on a rise.

Background and Aims: Decision-making whether or
not to extubate a premature infant is extremely complex
and based largely on clinical experience. A decision-
support tool can be used to aid inexperienced clinicians
in their decision-making and assist in decreasing the
number of false-positive (i.e. infants extubated too
early) and false-negative cases. Aim: To test a
previously developed web-based decision-support tool
employing an artificial neural network (ANN).
Methods: An ANN developed for the prediction of
extubation outcome in mechanically ventilated
premature infants was tested using data from 102 infants
with birth weights (BW) ranging from 590–3200 grams.
Proportions of failed and successful extubations
were compared for clinicians and the ANN for the entire
sample and by BW categories (<900g, 900 and
1500g, >1500g).
- 288 -
Results: 80 infants were determined as ready for
extubation. Of those, 13 infants had to be reintubated
within 48 hours of extubation. Overall the ANN
predicted 84% correctly, 79% successful extubations
and 5% failures. 11% were incorrectly classified as
successful and 5% as failures. Overall agreement
between experienced clinicians and the ANN was 63%
(p<0.0001); for infants with BW <900g the agreement
was 58% compared to 44% for birth weight >1500g and
84% for infants with BW between 900g and 1500g.
Conclusions: The ANN as a predictive tool can provide
decision-support to inexperienced clinicians in
determining when to extubate a premature infant in any
NICU. Further enhancement of the ANN predictions
through training with newly collected data for BW
below 900g and above 1500g will create potential for
integration with broader clinical management systems.

Background and Aims: Partial liquid ventilation is an
successful experimental therapy used in the respiratory
distress syndrome in immature newborns. To investigate
the influence of partial liquid ventilation on pulmonary
recruitment and on brain damage in an experimental
model of asphyctic preterm lambs.
Methods: 12 fetal lambs of 125-133 days of
developmental age (term: 145 days) were subjected to
hypoxic-ischemic event (HI) by partial occlusion of
umbilical cord during 60 minutes. Animals were
randomly allocated to: Control group, sacrificed
immediately after HI event (Control, n=3), controlled
mechanical ventilation group (CMV, n=6) and partial
liquid ventilation group (PLV, n=3) treated with 30
ml/kg of perfluorodecalin and both sacrificed after 3
hours. Lungs and brains were fixed by perfusion and
embedded in paraffin wax. Lungs sections were stained
with hematoxylin-eosin for morphometric studies
(percentage of air space, alveolar surface, alveolar
perimeter and wall thickness). Brain sections were
immunostained by TUNEL method for apoptotic cell
count. One-factor ANOVA was performed (p<0.05).
Results: In the lung, both ventilatory therapies showed
significant differences in all the studied parameters in
comparison to the control group. Moreover, PLV group
improved the alveolar expansion in relation to the CMV
group (alveolar surface: 3925±1322 vs. 2146±1010
μm2; alveolar perimeter: 283±61 vs. 249±65 μm). In
relation to brain lesion, CMV group showed a higher
apoptotic cell count (83±11) in comparison to both
control (18±8) and PLV groups (34±12).
Conclusions: Our results suggest that PLV improves the
alveolar recruitment without adverse effect on the brain
injury in preterm lambs. Grants: 9/UPV00077.327-

Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA
Background and Aims: Extremely preterm infants
often develop chronic lung disease (CLD) characterized
by heterogeneous aeration, poorly supported, floppy
airways and air trapping. High-frequency jet ventilation
(HFJV) with high end-expiratory pressure (optimal lung
volume strategy, OLVS) may improve airway patency,
lead to better gas distribution, improve gas exchange
and facilitate extubation. To explore, in a pilot trial, the
effect of HFJV on oxygenation, ventilation, and ease of
extubation in preterm infants with evolving CLD and
refractory respiratory failure (RRF).
Methods: From 9/02 to 10/04 twelve episodes of RRF
developed in 10 ventilated extremely immature infants
with evolving CLD (10 on conventional and 2 on high-
frequency oscillation). Chorioamnionitis was confirmed
in all infants, patent ductus arteriosus was ligated in 5
patients and Ureaplasma urealyticum was cultured from
trachea in 4 patients. HFJV (Life Pulse, Bunnell Inc)
with OLVS was initiated when oxygenation index (OI)
> 10 or tidal volume (Vt) 7ml/kg were required to
maintain PaCO2 < 60 mmHg. Inspiratory time 0.02 and
frequency 310-420/min were set initially with
adjustment of pressure amplitude to keep PaCO2 45-55
mmHg. Ventilatory stabilization and weaning from
mechanical ventilation with extubation to nasal CPAP
were the goals of this approach. Gas exchange data were
analyzed by ANOVA for repeated measures.
Results: Ten patients on 11 occasions of RRF were
extubated to nasal CPAP successfully in a median of
15.5 days. Nine of ten patients survived (1 died of
Cantrell´s Pentalogy), all required supplemental O2 at
36 weeks. PaCO2 fell within 1 hour after the initiation
of HFJV and OI decreased by 24 hours. Both remained
significantly lower until successful extubation
(p < 0.02).
Conclusions: Compared to conventional ventilation or
HFOV, HFJV used with OLVS improves gas exchange
and may facilitate weaning from MV in extremely
immature infants with evolving CLD. These
encouraging pilot data support a larger clinical trial.

RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME IN
NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT
L T Neskovska, R D Stojkovska
Department of Neonatology, City Hospital, Kumanovo,
Macedonia
Background and Aims: Respiratory distress syndrome
(RDS) is one of the most common pathologies in
neonatal ICU and a significant cause of neonatal
mortality. Elaboration of RDS in newborns according to
the etiology, treatment and outcome.
Methods: Newborns delivered at the Gynaecology and
Obstetrics Ward in Kumanovo during the period of 2003
and 2004. Clinical, laboratory, microbiological and
radiology methods.
Results: 3365 newborns were treated at the Nursery
Ward. 225 (6.68%) were found to suffer from RD.
According to aetiology they have been categorized in
the following way: 1. Pulmonary origin *RDS through
immaturity -158 (70.22%) *RDS through co natal
Bronchopneumonia - 10 (4.44%) *Transitory tachypnea
- 4 (1.77%) *Aspiration Bronchopneumonia - 3 (1.33%)
*Labour asphyxia - 32 (14.22%) 2. Extra-pulmonary
origin *Phrenic hernia - 2 (0.88%) *Cardiopathio
congenita - 2 (0.88%) *Sepsis - 14 (6.22%) Apart from
applying appropriate therapy, all newborns had
undergone oxygen-therapy in order to meet the newborn
needs and the severity of the disease. The main goal in
treating newborns suffering from RD was maintaining
acid-base status, saturation SaO2, from 88-92% at the
initial period up to 92-98%. In order to achieve
satisfactory level, heated and moistened oxygen was
administrated by using special suit and mask. Out of the
total number of newborns suffering from RDS, 178
(79.11%) were sent to tertian level for further treatment.
Death rate at RD is high and counts 83.9%.
Conclusions: RDS in the examined population was
common cause for admission to the ICU and a cause for
death as well.
SUCROSE 24% DURING HEELSTICK LESS
EFFECTIVE FOR INFANTS BEYOND
NEONATAL AGE?
H te Beest, I van't Wout, M van Dijk
Pediatric Surgical Intensive Care Unit, Erasmus MC-
Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Oral sucrose has a known
analgesic effect in (premature) neonates during
heelstick. Contradictory results have been reported
concerning the efficacy of sucrose during painful
procedures in older infants. We conducted a study aimed
to determine the usefulness and efficacy of sucrose in
neonates and infants younger than 4 months on our
Pediatric Surgical Intensive Care Unit, a group which
comprizes 46% of total patients.
Methods: Eligible children received 1 ml of sucrose
24% through a syringe in combination with a pacifier 2
minutes before heelstick. During the procedure, a nurse
assessed pain using the COMFORT Behavior Scale and
noted heart rate and oxygen saturation (registered every
30 seconds) for comparison with baseline values (mean
of previous 6 hours). COMFORT behavior scores
exceeding 16 indicate pain.
Results: During 10 weeks 38 assessments were
performed in 17 infants (4 girls and 13 boys) with mean
postnatal age 24 days (range 2 to 108 days). The median
pain score was 14 (range 9 to 24). Pain scores exceeded
16, and thus indicated pain, in 11 observations (29%), in
three of which the infant underwent suctioning just
before or during the procedure. Median heart rate
increase was 16; oxygen saturations did not change
substantially. The correlation between postnatal age and
mean COMFORT behavior score during heelstick was
0.59 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.83, n=17).
Conclusions: Administering sucrose before heelstick to
infants seems less effective than in neonates. However,
our sample was small and we will need more data to
confirm our observations.

Department of Pediatric Intensive Care, Erasmus MC-
Sophia, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: To study current strategies of
national PICU's in treatment of hyperglycaemia in
critically ill children. To design a protocol for treatment
of hyperglycaemia with insulin for critically ill children.
Methods: Survey by a questionnaire sent to the 8
PICU's in the Netherlands. Literature search of protocols
used in adult studies. Retrospective analysis of children
treated with insulin in the past years on our PICU.
Results: In 2 of the 7 PICU's a protocol was present.
Treatment starts in 4 PICU's after two blood glucose-
measurements >10 mmol/l, in one >8,3 mmol/l and in
one >11 mmol/l. In 6 of the 7 PICU's a standard amount
of glucose was given on admission. The start doses of
insulin was in 5 PICU's 0.02 IU/kg/hr, in one PICU
between 0,05 and 0,1 IU/kg/hr and in one PICU the start
doses varied. In 6 of the 7 PICU's control of blood
glucose after start treatment was done after 1 hour All
centres are willing to participate in a national (nurse
driven) protocol. The final design of our protocol
consisted an age dependent standard glucose intake (2-6
mg/kg/min), an insulin starting dose depending from the
initial glucose level (0,02-0,05 IU/kg/hr). The dose of
insulin was adjusted depending from the decrease or
increase of the glucose level.
Conclusions: A protocol was designed based on
standard glucose intake and varying the amount of
insulin depending from the level of glucose and the
decrease and increase of glucose levels. Most PICU's
are willing to participate in a national nurse driven
protocol.
ESTABLISHING A KNOWLEDGE CENTRE FOR
BREASTFEEDING INFANTS WITH SPECIAL
NEEDS

Knowledge Centre for Breastfeeding Infants With
Special Needs, Rigshospitalet University Hospital,
Copenhagen, Denmark
Background and Aims: Premature infants, sick
newborns, infants and children with a variety of
diagnoses have problems in establishing breastfeeding
and maintaining breastfeeding. The National Hospital in
Denmark, Rigshospitalet, is establishing a Knowledge
Centre for Breastfeeding Infants with Special Needs.
Successful fundraising has made a 3 years project
possible.
Methods: The Knowledge Centre gather, systematize
and develop knowledge and experiences both at the
Rigshospitalet as well as national and international.
Together with literature searches this will be the basis
for guidelines in breastfeeding infants with special
needs. In cooperation with the neonatal and paediatric
departments the Knowledge Centre will develop
practice in Rigshospitalet that care, treatment and
counselling in relation to breastfeeding infants with
special needs, will be uniform, evidence based and off
high quality. The Knowledge Centre will identify areas
off research and bring up to date the latest knowledge in
the area. One topic of interest is breastfeeding premature
infants still in need off CPAP-treatment. The homepage
off the Knowledge Centre will ensure knowledge
sharing.
Results: Establishing the Knowledge Centre began
September 2005.
VALIDATION OF THE IRMA TRUPOINT
BLOOD ANALYSIS SYSTEM FOR USE IN
NEONATAL/PEDIATRIC ECMO APPLICATIONS
R Groenewegen, J Wierema, D Tibboel
PICU, Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Children's
Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Extracorporeal Membrane
Oxygenation (ECMO), a high technology intervention
for newborns and children suffering from severe
cardiopulmonary disorders is associated with significant
morbidity. Close surveillance of blood gases and
electrolytes is required to ensure physiologic function.
An evaluation was conducted to assess the bedside
IRMA TRUpoint . Blood Analysis System (NJ, USA),
when used by nursing and medical staff to monitor
ECMO patients.
Methods: Blood collected from neonatal and pediatric
ECMO patients was analyzed for blood gases and
electrolytes using the TRUpoint and the laboratory
reference analyzer, ABL Radiometer (Copenhagen,
Denmark). Blood gas data were evaluated by linear
regression, electrolytes for statistical difference
(p <0.05) by Student's t-test.
Results: See Table.
Conclusions: Blood gases and electrolytes all show
strong agreement with the laboratory analyzer. Results
from critical tests can be used to assess ECMO patient
status and modulate therapeutic strategies in a similar
manner whether the result is from the TRUpoint or the
laboratory. One major advantage of using a bedside
device is to obtain data within minutes from blood
sampling. This eliminates delays inherent to sending
samples for laboratory analysis, allowing faster response
time for critical interventions.
NASAL CONTINUOS POSITIVE AIRWAY
PRESSURE (N-CPAP)
B Pallesgaard, L T Larsen
NICU, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark
Background and Aims: In Denmark infants with lung
injuries and breathing problems have previously been
treated with N-CPAP for many years. Even extreme
premature infants and infants with severe lung problems
can be treated with N-CPAP. Respirator is often avoided
when using N-CPAP or only used for a short time if the
infant needs Surfactant. Mechanical Ventilation is
practically never used more than one week.
Methods: Our N-CPAP system is almost like infant-
flow just simpler and not as heavy and big. The
N-CPAP treatment is often introduced with 6-8 cm of
water or flow 12-13 L/min and reduced to 4 cm or
8 L/min to decline the treatment.
Results: The treatment with N-CPAP is more gentle for
the infants lungs. In Denmark infants seldom have
Broncho-pulmonal-dysplasia - not even extreme
premature infants.
Conclusions: Socially it is easier for the parents to
handle their infant - regarding bathing, changing diaper
or to sit with their infant. Psychologically N-CPAP is
more gentle for the infant because it isn't medicated in
any way. It can move freely and has very little or no
pain and discomfort.

Background and Aims: In the literature it is important
for mothers to problem solving related with taking care
of their newborns. Because of that, nurses have to
identify if and when mothers need support after the
assessment of the care ability of mothers performed by
nurses. The purpose of this study was to assess and
compare the problem solving skills related with baby
care of mothers who have normal or premature
newborns.
- 291 -
Methods: This study is a descriptive and comparative
study. The research to place at the government hospital
in Sakarya. The samples in the research were volunteer
participant mothers who have normal neonates and
premature newborns. All of the test subjects were
healthy newborns, normal or premature. There were 43
of normal newborns and 43 of premature newborns
chosen for the study. Data was obtained using an
'Introductory Information Form' and 'Problem-Solving
Skills Assessment Questionnaire: How I Deal with
Problems Regarding Care of my Baby'.
Results: In a test taken by 43 woman with normal
newborn babies. The average points scored reached
198.16 ± 19.57. In the same test taken by 43 women
with premature born babies, the average points scored
was 157.18 ± 35.23. Significant difference was found
between two groups (t=6.66; p=0.03).
Conclusions: Mothers who have premature babies need
more support to develop their problem solving skills
regarding care of their baby.

Background and Aims: Fetal growth restriction is
associated with chronic fetal under nutrition and
hypoxemia and is known to result in life long alterations
in HPA and other hormone axis (2004, Fowden &
Forhead). Aim: To study the effect of chronic under
nutrition and hypoxia on the fetal response to acute
stress late in gestation.
Methods: Three groups of fertilised eggs of White
Leghorn chicken were incubated: 1) Chronic hypoxia
group: incubation in a hypoxic (15% O2) environment.
2) Malnutrition group: incubation after removal of 10%
of the egg's albumin in a normoxemic environment.
3) Control group. At day 18, the eggs were exposed to a
5-minute challenge of acute hypoxia (5% of oxygen).
Plasma corticosterone and catecholamines were
measured at baseline and after the acute hypoxic
challenge.
Results: Chronic hypoxia resulted in elevated
catecholamine levels in baseline conditions (epinephrine
2.7 vs 0.7 nmol/l) whereas corticosterone level was
decreased (15.3 vs 25.9 nmol/l). After the acute hypoxic
insult catecholamine levels increased markedly without
any difference between the groups. Corticosterone
increased also, however to a significant lower level in
the chronic hypoxia group (18,9 vs 34.6 nmol/l).
Chronic under nutrition had no influence on the stress
response.
Conclusions: Chronic fetal hypoxemia resulted in
elevated baseline catecholamine levels and decreased
corticosterone levels. In response to acute hypoxia
catecholamine release was unaffected but corticosteron
release was blunted. Chronic under nutrition did not
affect baseline levels nor the response to acute hypoxia.
THE EFFICACY OF INTRA-TRACHEAL

OF VENTILATED CHILDREN WITH STATUS
ASTHMATICUSAND BRONCHIOLITIS WITH
PERSISTENT RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS

Evelina Childrens Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: Mucous plugging of the
airways may play a central role in ventilated patients
with status asthmaticus and bronchiolitis where
respiratory acidosis is progressive despite optimising
conventional therapy. In both conditions airway
secretions may be rich in extracellular DNA.1,2. The
aim of this study was to demonstrate if the mucolytic
action of intra-tracheal DNAse could improve gas
exchange in a cohort of ventilated patients with
refractory hypercarbia (pCO2 > 8kPa, pH< 7.2).
Methods: Retrospective review of patients meeting
criteria.
Results: See chart.
Conclusions: Intratracheal DNAse therapy was
associated with a significant reduction in arterial pCO2
in a cohort of patients with severe airway obstruction
and respiratory acidosis in both asthma and
bronchiolitis. This is most likely due to enhanced
mucous clearance and hence reduction in airflow
obstruction. Further studies are warranted.
INTRAVENOUS SALBUTAMOL THERAPY AND
KETONURIA: A DOSE DEPENDENT
METABOLIC ADVERSE EFFECT
P Maheshwari, R Chhabra, P Ramnarayan
PICU, St Mary's Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: To study the metabolic adverse
effects of intravenous salbutamol in acute severe
asthma.
Methods: Consecutive referrals of acute severe asthma
to a regional transport service, who were on intravenous
salbutamol were studied. Patients were divided in 2
groups based on salbutamol infusion rate (group 1: 3
mcg/kg/min, group 2: 3-5 mcg/kg/min). Heart rate,
respiratory rate, blood glucose levels, serum bicarbonate
- 292 -
levels, base deficit, serum lactate and urine ketones on
dipstix at 4 and 12 hours after starting salbutamol
infusion were recorded.
Results: Both the groups were comparable with regard
to age and weight. All patients in both the groups had
received hydrocortisone; 2 patients in group 1 and 7 in
group 2 were on aminophylline infusion; 2 patients in
group 1 and 8 patients in group 2 had received
magnesium sulphate bolus intravenously. There was
significant ketonuria in group 2 compared to group 1
(Fischer exact test, p value <0.01). There was no
significant difference between the groups with respect to
aminophylline infusion or magnesium sulphate (p value
>0.05). Blood glucose and base deficit were increased
although there was no significant difference in both the
groups. There was no significant difference in heart rate
(p value 0.319) and respiratory rate (p value 0.269) in
both the groups. There was no significant difference in
serum bicarbonate (p value >0.05) and serum lactate
(p value >0.05) at 4 and 12 hours after starting
salbutamol infusion.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that salbutamol
infusion in doses >3 mcg/kg/min causes significant
ketonuria associated with acidosis.

Department of Paediatrics, Public Hospital, Kumanovo,
Macedonia
Background and Aims: Bronchial asthma, a frequent
disease in the childhood is a serious problem in
anesthesiology. The basic problem is endotracheal
intubations as a possible provocative factor of
bronchospasam in the tracheobronchial three.
Methods: The aim of this study is to present a case a of
six year old boy, bronchial asthma patient of 4 years,
who had to be urgently operated on appendix. The
patient at the moment has been in a symptom-free
period, the last asthmatic episode and the last
glucocorticoid administration had been 3 months ago.
Results: The patient was premeditated by Amp. Atropin
0,3 mg, Amp. Phenergan 20 mg, Amp. Dalantin 40 mg;
i.m. single dose of Solu-Cortef 100mg was applicated
i.v. to prevent bronchospasm during the intubation. The
intubations was done in deep anesthesia with Thiopental
100mg and Pavulin 1mg (initial barbiturate narcosis) 30
minutes after the premedication. 3% halothane was
given as an initial dosage, 1-2% was given as a
maintaining dosage. The appendectomy was performed
with in 30 min. While the duration of the narcosis was
50 minutes. The extubation was done in deep anesthesia
by Halothane - at the end of inspirium to prevent
laryngo-spasm. Due to preventive steps there was not
any attack of bronchospasam during the operation and
the postoperative course.
Conclusions: The patients with bronchial asthma are
serious problem for the Anaesthesiologists. Preventive
steps (adequate premedication and deepness of the
narcosis, the moment of the etubation) are necessary to
avoid respiratory complications.

Background and Aims: Regarding the suggestion that
regular exercise and physical fitness are protective
against asthma, the study was aimed to explore the
impact of sedentary regimen, through duration of
television (TV) watching, on asthma in young
adolescents.
Methods: Self-reported data obtained through ISAAC
phase 3 questionnaire on asthma and environmental
questionnaire from 3,026 children aged 13/14 years
from randomly selected schools in Skopje, the capital of
Macedonia, were analysed. The relationship between
wheeze or asthma 'ever' (W or A), current wheeze
(W12), current speech-limiting wheeze (WS12), current
exercise-induced wheeze (EW12), current dry night-
cough (NC12) and daily TV watching, adjusted for body
mass index, indoor air pollution, cat and dog ownership,
was investigated. Odds ratios in logistic regression for
statistic analysis of data were performed.
Results: A positive association between TV watching
more than 3 hours daily and W12 (OR 1.38, 95% CI
1.04-1.82 p=0.026), and EW12 (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.10-
1.71 p=0.006) was established. A significant association
between TV watching and asthma severity or ever-
diagnosed asthma was not found.
Conclusions: It seems that being sedentary and lack of
physical fitness increase the risk of current wheeze and
exercise-induced wheeze in young adolescents.
ATOPIC DERMATITIS AND FAMILY HISTORY
OF ALLERGIC DISEASES IN ASTHMATIC AND
NON ASTHMATIC CHILDREN
I B Sokolovski, J B Minov
Department of Pediatrics, Public Health Center, Skopje,
Macedonia
Background and Aims: Bronchial asthma is the most
frequent chronic diseases in childhood. It is well known
fact that infants suffered from atopic dermatitis (AD)
and/or positive family history of allergic diseases have
higher risk to develop asthma. The aim of our study is to
compare the prevalence of AD and positive family
history of allergic diseases in children with asthma and
nonasthmatic children.
Methods: Personal history of AD and family history of
allergic diseases were compared at 60 children with
asthma (36 boys and 24 girls) aged 10-14, mean age
12,5 (3,8) and equal number of nonasthmatic children
matched by sex and age. The data obtained were
statistically analysed by descriptive and inferential
methods.
- 293 -
Results: AD precedes asthma in 45% of children with
asthma (46% of the boys and 42% of the girls). The
prevalence of AD was significantly higher in asthmatic
compared to nonasthmatic children (45% vs 11%
p< 0,01). Positive family history of allergic diseases had
37,5% 0f children with asthma (38,5 of the boys and
35,7 of the girls) and its prevalence was significantly
higher compared to nonasthmatic children (37,5% vs
2,5%, p<0,01).
Conclusions: Our results confirm the role of AD and
positive family history of allergic diseases as risk factors
for childhood asthma.
ALLERGIC RHINITIS IN CORRELATION WITH
ASTHMA BRONCHIALE IN CHILDHOOD
S V Stankovic
Department of Paediatrics, General Hospital,
Kumanovo, Macedonia
Background and Aims: The aim of the study is to
present the incidence of the allergic rhinitis in
correlation with the asthma bronchiale in childhood.
Methods: The date for our investigation were received
from the medical documentation at The Paediatric
Pulmonology Ambulance in Kumanovo. The diagnosis
was determined on the basis of anamnesis, clinical and
laboratory examinations according standard diagnostic
criteria from diagnosing allergic rhinitis and asthma
bronchiale.
Results: We monitored 165 patients (from 1 to 14
years) with diagnosed asthma bronchiale. The majority
of them 89 or 53,9% had additional symptoms of
allergic rhinitis. In 26 or 29,2% of the cases had both
disorders appeared at the same time. 47 or 52,8% of the
patients get allergic rhinitis first and 16 or 18% asthma.
The most common allergic rhinitis was found in age
group of 6-14 years.
Conclusions: Asthma bronchiale is frequently
accompanying by allergic rhinitis. Our results
correspond with the literature, it is proved that allergic
rhinitis is precipitating factor for asthma bronchiale.
Early diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is of a great
importance due to tamely undertaking of preventive
measures and treatment of allergic rhinitis as real risk
for development of asthma bronchiale.
CONTROLLING PAEDIATRIC ASTHMA - OUR
EXPERIENCE
S V Stankovic, A S Sulejmani, M S Mihajlovska,
R D Stojkovska
Department of Paediatrics, General Hospital,
Kumanovo, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Good compliance and
education the children and their parents are very
important for controlling child asthma. We want to
present our results of 8 year's work in paediatric asthma
following the GINA guidelines.
Methods: We selected our patients in two groups to
base oneself on monitoring their asthma control.
Results: In first group had 137 children with nearly
controlled asthma. There were good compliance with
themselves asthma management plan, by regular
monthly visits, ongoing education and working together
with children and their parents. In second group had 93
children with uncontrolled asthma. 37 of them had not
any daily anti-inflammatory therapy, 29 had
inappropriate inhalation technique and 25 didn't use
spacer or face mask. In 41 patients therapy didn't
correlate with asthma severity. In 19 cases was found
parents fear of side effects, in 33 had financial
difficulties in families that limited therapy. Also in 17
case persisted in keeping their pets and 39 had parents'
smokers. In 43 patients were identified more then one
factor for uncontrolling asthma. In I group we noted
regular visits in all patients (at 1-6 month) but in II
group 79% patients went to doctor only worsening of
them disease. PEF variability were less then 20% (I
group) versus greater then 20-30% (II group). In I group
we found diminished emergency visits (by 71%) and
hospitalizations (by 49%) in relation II group during the
same period. That showed significantly reduction cost of
care in I versus II group.
Conclusions: This study demonstrated that good doctor-
patient partnership is the key to controlled child asthma.
NASAL AND BLOOD EOSINOPHILIA IN
CHILDREN WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA,
SEASONAL AND PERENNIAL ALLERGIC
RHINITIS

Pediatric Clinic, University Hospital 'Alexandrovska',
Sofia, Bulgaria
Background and Aims: Allergic diseases are a major
reason for blood eosinophilia among children and adult
population. Cytological assessment of nasal smear and
determination of eosinophil count in differential analysis
of blood are important laboratory methods in diagnostic
approach of allergic diseases.
Methods: Children were divided into three groups. First
group included 37 patients with bronchial asthma with
mean age 5.3 years (mean eosinophil percentage in nasal
smear- 4% and 2% eosinophils in blood differential
analysis). Second group was formed of 11 children with
both asthma and seasonal allergic rhinitis with mean age
9.3 years (mean percentage of eosinophils in nasal
smear was the highest in this group – 7%, in differential
count – 3%). And third group include 5 patients with
asthma and perennial allergic rhinitis with mean age
12.8 years (mean percentage of eosinophils in nasal
smear – 5%, blood eosinophils – 3%).
Results: Analyzing results from the three groups
regarding patient’s age is obvious that mean age in
second and third group is higher than in the first group.
In the same groups is higher the percentage of mean
nasal and blood eosinophilia. The highest nasal
eosinophilia is found in children with asthma and
seasonal allergic rhinitis.
Conclusions: Determination of nasal and peripheral
(blood) eosinophilia are important diagnostic methods in
children with bronchial asthma and co-existing seasonal
or perennial allergic rhinitis.

CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA UNDERGOING
FOOD CHALLENGES
A Krogulska, K Wasowska-Królikowska, J Dynowski,
B Trzezwinska
Department of Allergology, Gastroenterology and
Nutrition for Children, Medical University Lodz, Poland
Background and Aims: It has been shown that food
allergy does not always manifest within the respiratory
tract in such as obvious way as: Dyspnea, cough or
wheezing. The aim of the study was to evaluate the
influence of food allergens on bronchial reactivity in
children with asthma challenged with food.
Methods: A total of 95 patients (age range 6 to 18
years, mean 10 years) with atopic asthma were
evaluated for food allergy by means of questionnaire,
skin prick testing, specific IgE tests (Pharmacia CAP
System FEIA) and DBPCFC. Bronchial hyperreactivity
was measured by methacholine inhalation challenges
performed before and after DBPCFC in 34 asthmatic
patients suspected of food allergy.
Results: Food allergy was confirmed by DBPCFC in 11
asthmatic children. The mean FEV1 before and after
food challenges in the positive group was 2.25±0.87 l
and 2.15±1.02 l respectively which was not significantly
different (p>0.05). The mean PC20 in positive group
was 1.41±1.39 mg/ml and 0.96±0.93 mg/ml before and
after food challenge respectively which was not
significantly different (p>0.05). In the negative group
the mean PC20 was 2.07±3.34 and 2.06±3.35 before and
after challenge respectively (p>0.05).
Conclusions: Food allergy was present in 11.6%
children with asthma. Food challenges in these children
increased bronchial reactivity, without exacerbation.
Food allergies in asthmatic children can present not only
with most commonly reported gastrointestinal
symptoms and skin rash, but also with increased
bronchial reactivity. Evaluation of food allergy in
patients with asthma is indicated.
BRONCHIAL HYPERREACTIVITY IN
CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA
A Krogulska, K Wasowska-Królikowska
Department of Allergology, Gastroenterology and
Nutrition for Children, Medical University Lodz, Poland
Background and Aims: Bronchial hyperreactivity
(BHR) is a characteristic feature of asthma, but is
neither specific nor constant. Bronchial hyperreactivity
can be evaluated by methacholin inhalation challenge
(MIC) which assesses a non-specific airway
hyperresponsiveness. The aim of the study was to
evaluate bronchial hyperreactivity in children with
asthma and its correlation with clinically relevant
parameters such as age, sex, weight, height, parameters
of ventilation, atopy, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and
clinical course.
Methods: A total of 74 patients (age range 6 to 18
years) with atopic asthma were evaluated for bronchial
hyperreactivity, using methacholin challenge testing
(two-minute tidal breathing dosing protocol).
Results: On the basis of the performed study, BHR was
recognized in 68 (91.9%) children. Mild hyperreactivity
was found most often. Borderline values of PC20 were
determined in 10.8% of children, normal values of PC20
in 8.1% of children. PC20 positively correlated with
ventilation parameters of small bronchi, but did not
correlate with other spirometric parameters. PC20 had a
positive correlation with positive skin prick tests. The
correlation between BHR and therapy with ICS was
detected. There was no correlation between PC20 and
age, sex, weight, height.
Conclusions: Increased BHR was related to episodes of
infections and dyspnea. BHR is more common in
children with positive skin prick test. Therapy with ICS
reduces BHR.

Background and Aims: We did exercise tests with
crying, swallowing, stepping and feeding them that we
found many patients whom they haven't had symptoms
in normal activity but after introduction of exercise the
symptoms appeared.
Methods: Case Study.
Results: The Exercise test is a very useful tool in rapid
diagnosis in respiratory problems.
Conclusions: We did investigations.

Background and Aims: It is known that atopic
individuals may present one or more allergic entities,
beginning with the cow milk proteins allergy,
continuing with atopic dermatitis, the allergic rhinitis,
than bronchial asthma. The authors' objective is to find
the ways to stop the allergy march.
Methods: In this study were included all the patients
hospitalized in Paediatric Clinic II Cluj-Napoca between
2003-2005, who presented at least one of the allergic
features. There were applied measures to prevent the
expression of other ways of going on of the allergic
march. Therefore, at the patients which presented
allergic symptoms at cow milk proteins, these proteins
were replaced with hydrolyzed hypoallergenic proteins;
at the patients with atopic dermatitis there were initiated
preventive measures to remove the offending allergens
from the patient's environment, and specific treatment
with antihistaminic drugs and topic treatment with
cortisone and elidel.
Results: In Pediatric Clinic II there were registered
during the period of two years 114 patients with
bronchial asthma, 46 patients with atopic dermatitis, 38
- 295 -
with cow milk proteins allergy, 57 patients with
bronchial asthma and rhinitis and 21 cases of allergic
rhinitis. From the 38 cases diagnosed with cow milk
allergy, only five of them evolved subsequent with
atopic dermatitis because of disregarding of the diet and
medication indicated. From 46 patients with atopic
dermatitis, only two developed allergic rhinitis and none
of them asthma.
Conclusions: The use of appropriate preventive and
therapeutic strategies stops or limits the development of
more allergic entities on the same individual.

adolescents aged 13/14 years from randomly selected
schools in Skopje were analysed. The relationship
between allergic rhinitis symptoms 'ever', current
allergic rhinitis symptoms, current allergic
rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms, interference with daily
activities because of current rhinitis symptoms, hay
fever 'ever' and daily TV watching, adjusted for body
mass index, indoor air pollution, cat and dog ownership,
was investigated. Odds ratios in binary logistic
regression for statistic analysis of data were performed.
Results: A positive association between TV watching
more than 3 hours daily and allergic rhinitis symptoms
'ever' (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.43 p=0.029) was
established. A significant association between TV
watching and current allergic rhinitis symptoms, their
severity or ever-diagnosed hay fever was not found.
Conclusions: It seems that being sedentary and lack of
physical fitness do not influence allergic rhinitis in
young adolescents.
PLASTIC BRONCHITIS AS A RESULT OF
ASTHMA AND BRONCHIECTASIS AT THE
SAME TIME: WHAT IS THE FIRST?
M Maneva, Z Sarevska, L Stojanovska
Institute for Respiratory Diseases in Children-Kozle,
Skopje, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Plastic bronchitis is defined as
a presence of acute or recurrent development of
bronchial casts, which causes obstruction of airways,
associated between the other with asthma or
bronchiectasis.
Methods: A 14 years old girl, otherwise healthy, who
had cough during last 4 months, was admitted. She was
treated four times to her age of 16 yr. The lung findings
were from pneumonia to repeated pleuropneumonies left
clinically, on X-ray and echo chest.
Results: Lab investigations (blood count, sweet and TB
tests, echinococcosis, and blood culture) were normal.
Sputum: M.catarrhalis or Str.pneumoniae. Functional
tests- from normal to obstruction and restriction. Skin
prick test was positive to Dermatophagoides. Fiberoptic
and rigid bronchoscopy: bronchial casts in the left
bronchial tree. Pathological findings: Fragments
consisting fibrin and eosinophilic infiltrates. Patient was
initially treated with standard therapy for pneumonia
and bronchial obstruction, later with topic steroid. She
was well one year, than she needs admissions several
times because of progression of disease when were
found out this typically signs of plastic bronchitis. At
the end of the course of disease left bronchiectasis was
developed. Finally, results of her healthy is unknown,
she never had come to us, again.
Conclusions: Our case shows pneumonia as first
condition, asthma as second, and finally, repeated left
pleuro-pneumonies with plastic bronchitis were the base
for development of bronchiectasis. We think that in that
case, circulus viciosus was made. Bronchoscopic
exploration is the unique method in diagnosis and
therapy of bronchitis plastica.
PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM DUE TO SEVERE
ASTHMA ATTACKS IN CHILDREN
L Petrusevska-Kolekevska, B Manceva, B Dimceva
Institute for Respiratory Diseases in Children-Kozle,
Skopje, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Although pneumotorax may
occur in patients with asthma it rarely occurs
spontaneously during an acute exacerbation in children
To show four children with pneumomediastinum
because of uncontrolled and under diagnosed asthma
disease.
Methods: In a period of ten years four children in our
Institute appeared with pneumomediastinum due to
asthma attacks. All necessary investigations were done.
Results: All of the patients had sudden onset of
symptoms, positive family history for atopy, positive
skin prick tests and increased IgE levels in serum. Two
of them have had pneumo-mediastinum in the last year
(asthma attacks were ignored from parents and
physicians). None of them was asthma prevented. In
three patients additional diagnosis was pneumonia.
Conclusions: Lack of recognition of life-threatening
asthma in children can have devastating consequences.
In efficient implementation of guidelines for treating
asthma still exist.

- 296 -
Department of Pediatrics, General University Hospital,
Heraklio, Crete, Greece
Background and Aims: Asthma treatment with
corticosteroids should be guided by symptoms and lung
function. Once asthma is controlled, the dose of
corticosteroids should be reduced to the lowest possible
and effective dose according to the standard guidelines.
Symptoms often deteriorate in well-controlled
asthmatics after a step down in therapy. We aimed to
assess the safety and the lung function changes in
asthmatic children after steroid step down.
Methods: 54 children (35 male) with moderate
persistent asthma aged (mean±SD) 10.13± 3.29 yrs that
their inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were reduced in a 3-
6month interval were studied. Asthma control, quality of
life and medication were recorded in all children.
Results: In 18.5% (10/54) of the patients receiving
median (range) 450 (200-1000) mcg budesonide the ICS
were stopped. There was no difference in FEV1%
predicted (mean±SD) before and after the steroid
discontinuation (108.7±6 vs 115.7±9, p=0.62). In 44/54
(81.5%) of the asthmatics the median (range) dose of
ICS was reduced significantly [500(200-1000) vs 320
(160-750) mcg, p<0.0001). The FEV1% predicted
(mean±SD) of those patients after the steroid step down
was slightly increased (109.8±18.9 vs 120±18.36,
p=0.012). In none of the 54 asthmatic children asthma
control was lost or any change at their quality of life was
exhibited, after the decrease or discontinuation of their
ICS treatment.
Conclusions: The reduction of inhaled corticosteroids
seems to be safe for the asthmatic children and the
young patient should be revaluated every 3-6 months to
avoid treatment with doses of ICS much higher than the
effective dose for the asthma severity.

Pediatric Clinic, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia
Background and Aims: The aim of this study was to
evaluate quality of life (QoL) in pediatric patients with
atopic diseases.
Methods: We evaluated QoL in 132 asthma patients by
using Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire
(PAQLQ), 122 patients with allergic rhinitis by using
Pediatric Rhiniconjuctivitis Quality of Life
Questionnaire (PRQLQ) and 40 patients with atopic
dermatitis by using Childhood Atopic Dermatitis Impact
Scale (CADIS). Severity of atopic diseases was made
with GINA (for asthma), ARIA (for allergic rhinitis) and
SCORAD (for atopic dermatitis) classification.
Results: The evaluation and analysis of questionnaires
showed that there is a statistically significant correlation
of overall QoL scores and severity of atopic diseases.
Conclusions: This study shows that children with atopic
diseases have significant impairment on HRQoL. With
medical categorization of severity of atopic diseases,
which is priory based severity of symptoms, we can
assess a degree of HRQoL impairment.
WHEEZING EPISODES AND VASCULAR
ANOMALIES IN CHILDHOOD
O Zafirovski, J Buzarov, S Galbova, M Caparoska,
V Stevic
Institute for Respiratory Diseases in Children - Kozle,
Skopje, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Congenital cardiovascular
anomalies are rare but treatable cause of stridor in the
paediatric population. It has been estimated that up to
3% of the population have congenital anomalies of the
aortic arch complex and we feel that many patients
currently being diagnosed as having recurrent croup or
atypical asthma with recidivate wheezing episodes must
be excluded from this group.
Methods: We had 10 cases of congenital vascular
anomalies causing tracheobronchial compression and
wheezing episodes with following diagnosis: Arcus
aortae duplex (2); right sided aortal arch with left
ligamentum arteriosum and ductus arteriosus persistence
(1); Anomalous arteria innominata (6); Anomalous
initial point of the left pulmonary arteria (1). Presenting
symptoms included stridor (100%), persistent cough
(70%), chronic dyspnoea (70%), recurring respiratory
tract infections (80%) and dysphagia (20%).
Results: Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were
diagnostics in all cases. They were our investigation of
choice. Two (20%) underwent aortopexy, 3 (30%) had
division of the non-dominant aortic arch and 5 (50%)
were managed conservatively. They were followed for
up to six years post-operatively and 80% had complete
resolution of their symptoms.
Conclusions: In recidivate wheezing episodes we have
to think about vascular anomalies, especially in small
children. We feel that only a high clinical index of
suspicion will enable these potentially fatal anomalies to
be diagnosed.

Spain
Background and Aims: Study the incidence of urinary
malformations (UM) during the period 1997-2005.
Methods: A total number of 42361 newborns born alive
were delivered during this period in our hospital. Babies
that had been diagnosed during pregnancy were
observed and confirmed the malformation. In addition
all newborns that had to be hospitalized underwent
abdominal ultrasound.
Results: The total number of malformations was 630
(14,87%), 255 (40,51%) had to be hospitalized and 375
(59,48%) did not need hospitalization. UM has had an
increment in incidence during the years studied in this
period. Year 1997 7/4183 (0,64%) versus year 2006
166/9173 (1,80%). All the incidence index studied were
elevated. Less than 2500 gr. 159/859 (18,50%); less
- 297 -
than 37 weeks 166/859 (19,32%) and incidence of twins
was 37/859 (4,30%); low birth weight 37/859 (6,98%).
The relation male/female was 3:1.
Conclusions: The increment in incidence during the
years studied seems to be due to a more accurate
diagnose in pregnancy. The data obtained leads us to the
conclusion that the real incidence of UM must be much
higher than that obtained from the papers in this matter.
The more accurate prenatal diagnosis corresponded to
Q60 (CIE 10) and Q61. The concern is that only 9/25
urinary infections had prenatal diagnosis of UM.
HUMAN PARECHOVIRUS TYPE 3
RESPONSIBLE FOR TWO FATAL CASES OF
NEONATAL ENCEPHALITIS
C D Aarts-Tesselaar, P Govaert, A Vossen,
M de Hoog, K F M Joosten
Department of Paediatric Intensive Care, Erasmus MC,
Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Picornaviruses form a diverse
group of small, non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA
viruses. Parechoviruses belong to the picornavirus
family and are well known human pathogens
responsible for several clinical manifestations including
encephalitis in neonates and young children. We report
two cases of fatal neonatal encephalitis caused by
human parechovirus type 3 (HPEV3).
Methods: Two neonates (3 and 5 weeks old) were
referred to the paediatric intensive care unit because of
respiratory insufficiency and refractory convulsions
irresponsive to therapy. Despite intensive care and
extensive anticonvulsant treatment, both children
developed general brain damage. No curative treatment
was available and both children died. Investigation by
EEG, ultrasound and MRI was conducted to explore the
extensiveness of brain damage. Throat, nasopharyngeal
and rectal swabs, cerebrospinal fluid and serum was
collected and analysed by PCR and
immunofluorescence assay.
Results: Numerous EEG’s revealed progressive
multifocal epileptic activity in both children. Ultrasound
documented discrete ventriculomegaly and hyperechoic
white matter. MRI confirmed extensive loss of white
matter, diffuse edema, slit ventricles and white basal
ganglia, verifying (viral) encephalitis. HPEV3 was
isolated from the throat and nasopharyngeal swabs and
its genome was detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid. In
addition, HPEV3 was found in post mortal samples of
brain and lung tissue. The samples were negative for
other tested viruses.
Conclusions: Human parechoviruses can be responsible
for severe central nervous system infections leading to
death in neonates. Extensive viral cultures and
visualisation of the brain were clue to final diagnosis.

Background and Aims: Varicella is normally a benign
disease of childhood, but has potentially serious
complications. Varicella epidemiology is changing with
increasing use of varicella vaccine and data concerning
hospitalizations is still incomplete. Our aim is to
evaluate the complications of varicella in hospitalized
children and its relation with age, type of exposure,
underlying disease and the previous therapy.
Methods: Prospective study from January 2005 to
March 2006, of children and adolescents hospitalized
with varicella in Hospital Dona Estefânia and Hospital
Fernando Fonseca. Demographic, clinical features,
laboratory, therapy and evolution were analysed, using
SPSS for Windows.
Results: During the study period 58 children were
hospitalized. The median age was 2,5 years (range 10
days to 13 years). Nine (15,5%) children had underlying
disease. The reason for admission was complicated
varicella in 45 (77,6%); varicella during hospitalization
in 5 (8,6%); nosocomial varicella in 4 (6,9%) and risk of
severe varicella in 4 cases (6,8%). The complications
were cutaneous in 27 patients (46,6%), neurological in 7
(12,1%); respiratory in 6 (10,3%), digestive in 3 (5,2%)
and osteoarticular in 2 (3,4%). The mean length of
hospital stay was 6 days (range: 2 to 122 days) and the
mean associated cost per patient was 1996 Euros.
Conclusions: This study suggests a high morbidity
associated with varicella and its complications, as well
as high social and economic costs of this disease. The
national survey that has been set up since January 2006
in Portugal is important on the definition of subsequent
strategies for the country.

Background and Aims: The aim of our study was to
model the typical CSF findings of enteroviral meningitis
(80% of all aseptic meningitis) in children with the gold
standard of diagnosis, the PCR.
Methods: 34 children between 3 months and 12 years
admitted to SKMC from January 2005 to January 2006
were included. The diagnostic criteria were the presence
of RT-PCR enterovirus RNA (Roche Lightcycler) and
CSF pleocytosis of greater than 5 cell/mm3.
Results: The median length of stay (LOS) was 48 hours.
The mean (SD) serum WBC was 12.2 (3.6) and serum
PMN 77% (12.3). By multiple regression with LOS as
the dependent variable and using CSF PMN, CSF
glucose, serum WBC and serum PMN as predictors,
only CSF PMN was included in the model, with higher
CSF PMN being associated with shorter LOS (t = -
3.389, P = 0.002).

Conclusions: It is not unusual for neutrophils to
dominate in enteroviral meningitis. This description may
help physicians better evaluate their decision to start or
withhold antibiotics and avoid unnecessary co-
morbidity.

Background and Aims: In Mexico, there are limited
data that describe the burden of invasive pneumococcal
disease (IPD), serotype distribution, antibiotic
susceptibility and epidemiology. Knowledge resistance
is important for determining appropriate therapy for the
patient presenting to the hospital with an illness for
which Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) is a possible
cause.
Methods: Is an analytic study of 168 hospitalized
patients without pneumoccal vaccine and with IPD who
had Sp isolated in a sterile fluid between January 1997
and august 2004.
Results: In 168 patients with IPD, 107 male; we
isolated 168 Sp: 73 blood, 41 cerebrospinal fluid, 25
pleural fluid,11 peritoneal fluid, 6 joint fluid, 8 urine
and 4 mastoid fluid. Were 60.1% of the patient with
underlying disease. The case fatality rate was 28.5%,
associated with pneumococcal serotype and without
association with antibiotic susceptibility. Overall rates
of resistance, were as follows: penicillin, 62.5%; and
cefotaxima 23.3%. Underlying disease was significantly
associated with mortality (OR 5.4 (2.5-18.3); IC 95%:
p < 0.05). The serotypes significantly associated with
mortality were: 14. 6B, 23F, 6A, 19F and 19A.
Conclusions: Trend analysis indicated that mortality in
IPD have association with underlying disease. Five Sp
serotypes whit significant association with mortality are
in a 7-valent pneumoccocal conjugate vaccine (PCV7).
This fact is important because the PCV7 application
should be key for mortality prevention in IPD. The high
rates of resistant to –lactamics make necessary the
creation of a National System for knowledge of
serotypes and resistant of Sp in our country.
SECONDARY PROPHYLAXIS WITH
CLINDAMYCIN IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS

Hospital, Barcelona, Spain
Background and Aims: Recurrent skin abscesses are
relatively common in paediatrics. Use of clindamycin
therapy as secondary prophylaxis in adults has been
described for more than 20 years. However, pediatric
literature is scarce. Our aim was to describe efficacy,
tolerability and adverse effects of oral clindamycin in
immunocompetent children with recurrent skin
abscesses.
Methods: Medical charts of 16 patients attending our
centre from March 2002 to March 2006 were
prospectively reviewed. Group A received oral
clindamycin (150mg/1.73m2/day qd) during 3 months.
Group B did not receive clindamycin because inability
to swallow capsules, intolerance or family decision.
Topic mupirocine was used in nasal carriers of S. aureus
(SA).
Results: Ten patients received clindamycin, 6 did not.
No patient presented immunity abnormalities (normal
neutrophils oxidative burst, IgE and CD18). Sex: A:
60% females; B: 67% females. Median age at diagnose:
A: 10 yo; B: 6 yo. Underlying skin abnormalities: A:
5/10; B: 1/6. Median pre-treatment skin
infections/patient: A: 6; B: 3. Surgical drainage: A:
7/10; B: 2/6. Nasal carriers of SA: A: 1/9; B: 2/6. Skin
infections in relatives: A: 7/10; B: 4/6. Nasal carriers of
SA relatives: A: 2/9; B: 2/6. Post-clindamycin follow-up
in Group A: 5 months (1-14m);1 mild cellulitis. Follow-
up in Group B: 5 months (1-15m): no further skin
infections.
Conclusions: Oral clindamycin could be effective as
secondary prophylaxis in pediatric patients with
recurrent skin abscesses. Lower incidence and severity
of previous infections in group B could explain their
good evolution. Future studies are needed to determine
the role of prophylactic clindamycin in these patients.

Background and Aims: Children are frequent passive
smokers due to the active smoking of their guardians.
Our aim was to quantify the exposure of children to
smoke, to assess this exposure with regards to family
demographics and to present the perceptions of parents
regarding passive smoking of their children.
Methods: One hundred children (from 2.5 to 14 years
old, median age 4.5+/- 1.2) were enrolled that presented
either with chronic cough or for a routine follow-up.
Results: Data were collected from 12 fathers and 88
mothers, with a median age of 35+/- 6.2. Ten percent
- 299 -
have finished primary education, 30% secondary
education and 60% had an academic degree. Eighty
percent lived in a city, while 20% in a rural area, 70% in
a block of flats and 30% in a detached house. Sixty two
fathers were active smokers (median age that they
started smoking 17.49+/- 1.92, median number of
cigarettes per day 22.58 +/- 14.11) and 47 mothers
(median age that they started smoking 18.95+/- 2.44,
median number of cigarettes per day 18.05+/- 10.55).
Fifty eight percent of smoking parents smoke in the
house and of them 68% smoke in the presence of their
child. Of the 100 families, 67% allow guests to smoke
indoors, 95% believe that passive smoking is harmful
for their child, while 80% state that parental smoking is
a bad imitating influence for their child.
Conclusions: Passive smoking is quite frequent even in
children with respiratory symptoms and reflects their
parents’ perceptions regarding this habit.
RECURRENT CHEST INFECTIONS AND
PRIMARY PULMONARY TUMORS
I M Velissariou, E Latoufi
Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Athens Medical Centre,
Athens, Greece
Background and Aims: Primary tumors of the lung are
extremely rare in children and can occasionally present
as recurrent lower respiratory tract infections.
Methods: We present 2 cases of rare lung neoplasms
that were enrolled over a 3 year period, a 9 year old boy
and a 10 year old girl. Both children had documented
previous hospitalizations in the last few months due to
recurrent chest infections. Both cases were subjected to
a bronchoscopy that revealed a space occupying lesion
which was blocking the right main bronchus and the left
main bronchus, respectively. Biopsies were collected.
Computed tomography of the lung confirmed the
presence of a tumor.
Results: Both patients had a surgical exploration, during
which both tumors were removed following
bronchotomy of the right and left main bronchus,
respectively. The histological findings were suggestive
of adenocarcinomas of low differentiation. A complete
surgical excision was accomplished in both cases, hence
neither received any other treatment. Both had an
unremarkable postoperative period. Until the present
time, neither has shown any evidence of relapse.
Conclusions: Bronchoscopy and computed tomography
may be of use in children with recurrent episodes of
lower respiratory tract infections, as they may reveal the
presence of a rare primary pulmonary tumor that would
otherwise remain undiagnosed.

Detsko Oddelenie-Opsta Bolnica, Tetovo, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Respiratory diseases are the
frequent pathology in the infantile age. Aim: To present
the representation of the most frequent causes for
pneumonia.
Methods: A group of 215 patients was analysed, all
hospitalized in the Children's Department in the period
from 2002-2004 in the age of 0-3 years.
Results: Anamnestically 95,0% of the children had
information for cough, 93% were treated ambulant with
antibiotic. Auscultatory at 52% of the cases were with
crepitations, and Rtg-finding with present parenchyma
changes. On all the children a bacteriological
examination was realised on a drainage secretion At
49% (105) of the children the finding was positive.
Among them the most frequent bacteriological causes
were: -Streptococcus pneurnoniae among 39, 9 children
-Hemoplilus influensae 36 children -Staphylococcus
aureus 27 children -Pseudornonas auriginosa 2, 0
children According to the examination, children were
put on an antibiotic therapy.
Conclusions: Pneumonia in the early children's age still
has a significant role in the low-respiratory pathology.

Hospital, Vila Franca de Xira, Portugal
Background and Aims: Atypical pneumonia is the
main clinical presentation of infection to Mycoplasma
pneumoniae, but this bacteria is also responsible for
other manifestations with or without respiratory
involvement. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
epidemiology, presentation, clinical curse, therapeutic
and prognosis of this infection.
Methods: A retrospective review of 20 cases of
infection to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, confirmed by
ELISA, hospitalized in a six year period (February of
2000 to February of 2006) in a paediatric unit.
Results: During the study period we identified 20 cases
in children aged 9 months to 13 years (mean age 6
years), 50% female. Ten days was the average interval
between the initial symptoms and the admittance.
Before hospitalization 50% of the children were on
antibiotic therapies. In 75% fever was present and in
55% pneumonia was the clinical presentation (3 with
atelectasis and 1 with pleural effusion). In four children
there were other respiratory involvements. Five children
had skin involvement and four had osteoarticular
manifestations. Empiric antibiotic was prescribed in
70% of the cases. The clinical course was good in all
patients but two of them had a slow evolution towards
complete resolution.
Conclusions: With this study we pretend to demonstrate
the heterogeneity of the clinical presentation of the
infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and the frequent
good prognosis with spontaneous resolution.

Background and Aims: Community acquired
pneumonia (CAP) is still actual problem and the most
often cause for hospitalization of children in our
country. The aim of this study is to analyses dynamics,
frequency and diagnosis of this disease.
Methods: From the total number of 1750 patients at the
Department for acute respiratory diseases in preschool
and school children, 1458 (83.3%) histories of patients
with confirmed pneumonia were elaborated,
retrospectively. In the 5 years period till 2006 yr.,
number of hospitalizations was as follows:
220/320/310/263/345.
Results: Patients were at the age of 3 to 16 yr. (mean
8.5 yr.). Dominant symptoms were high temperature in
70%, rough cough -91%, difficult breathing in 12.4%,
hemopthysis -1.3%. Auscultatory finding with
crepitations was presented in 49% of the patients. Lung
radiograms contributed to pneumonia with right lung
domination. As diagnostic we used echo-sonography
and bronchological exploration on the breathing tree
(therapeutically, too). Laboratory findings were in
contribution with bacterial pneumonia. Etiologic
diagnosis was made only in 460 (31.5%) patients with
pneumonia. The most frequent causes were
Str.pneumonia-210 (45.6%), H.influenzae-190 (41.3%),
M.catarrhalis- 45 (9.7%), M.pneumoniae- 11 (2.3%).
Massive pneumonia was presented in 137 (9.36%)
patients (with atelectasis-19 (16.7%) and pleura
involving -34 (24.8%). Treatment duration was
approximately 7 to 10 days with favorable outcome,
except in 5 children.
Conclusions: CAP actuality without tends of decreasing
was shown in this study. CAP etiologic diagnosis is a
problem, too, especially important in order to fast,
adequate diagnosis, therapy and sequels prevention
(particularly in severe forms of pneumonia).

Methods: Medical documentation from the department
for acute respiratory diseases was retrospectively
analyzed for a period January 2000 to December 2005
yr.
Results: The total number of treated children was 2178.
From them, 36 (1.65%) were with CE. The frequency of
the disease, regarding each year properly was almost
constant; age of patients: 3 - 14 yr. (middle age=9 yr.).
Urban area place of living - 22 (61.5%) children. Lower
socioeconomic background and bed hygiene standards -
20 (55.5%) Cysts localization: in lungs-36 (100%), in
liver-15 (41.6%), in brain- 1 (2.7%). Surgical treatment
with good outcome - 36 (100%) children.
Conclusions: CE is our permanent medical and social
problem, also. Imperative is to emphasis preventive
activities included in a national and regional net of
control programs.

Background and Aims: Human Metapneumovirus
(hMPV) has been described as a causative agent for
acute respiratory tract infections and is considered one
of the main causes of hospitalisation for such infections
in young children worldwide. Currently, there is a
requirement for an antigen detection assay for
respiratory screening. Here we describe an antigen
detection system utilising a combination of monoclonal
antibodies directed to major hMPV proteins.
Methods: The performance characteristics of the
immunoassay system were evaluated using panels of
confirmed hMPV positive or negative respiratory
samples.
Results: The prototype assay results exhibited close
correlation to PCR data. A high level of specificity was
demonstrated with a panel of potentially cross-reactive,
non-hMPV, specimens. The newly developed
immunoassay has been found to be reactive with hMPV
subgroups 1 and 2 of genotypes A and B from viral
culture.
Conclusions: This efficient, specific assay may have
useful implications in hMPV detection in respiratory
specimens and/or in culture confirmation.

Background and Aims: Tobacco smoke is one of the
most important preventable environmental risk factors
to which children are exposed. Though most parents are
aware of the importance of protecting their children
from tobacco smoke exposure and of strategies for
prevention, children's exposure mainly transpires at
home. Objective of the study was to reveal attitudes
among Greek parents of school aged children towards
children's tobacco smoke exposure.
- 301 -
Methods: : Data derived from a sample of smoking and
nonsmoking parents (n=938) of 6 to 13 years old
children living in Attica. They answered a questionnaire
on their opinions and attitudes regarding children's
passive smoking. Data analysis was made with SPSS
10.0.
Results: 90.9% of parents said that they were informed
about tobacco smoke's effects on health. In 63% of
families there was one parent who smoked and in 25%
both parents were smokers. Of them, 59% smoke
indoors. 3 out of 5 parents stated that they allow their
guests to smoke indoors. Fathers use to smoke in the car
in the presence of their children more than mothers do
and 64.8% of them stated that their children complained
about that at least once in the past.
Conclusions: Results indicate that Greek parents need
more specific scientific guidance from experts, even
though the majority of them stated that they are well
informed and they take some kind of precaution. There
is great need for more intense efforts (e.g. policies, mass
media campaigns) to convince smokers to quit or at least
avoid indoors smoking.

PICU, P.&A. Kyriakou Children’s Hospital, Athens,
Greece
Background and Aims: To determine the demographic
characteristics, seasonal distribution, and complication
associated with RSV bronchiolitis in PICU.
Methods: Twenty-five children with RSV infection
were admitted on PICU over a 3-year period study.
Their medical charts were reviewed.
Results: Males were affected more that females with a
ratio 2,12:1. The epidemy appeared in December and
disappeared in May, with a peak of incidence during
March (40% of cases). More than half of hospitalized
children (56%) were between 35-60 days of age. The
indications for ICU admission were respiratory distress
in 76% of cases, apnea (20%) and sepsis (4%). One
child presented with pneumotorax. Mean PICU length
of stay was 6,44 days (SD 3,92). Most of children had
no underlying disease (76%). A small percentage (16%)
of children presented fever. Six children from the 25,
needed mechanical ventilation (mean 7,3 days) because
of apnea (33%) or severe respiratory distress (66%).
One child with positive urine culture was infected by
RSV during hospitalization for urine infection. No
children had positive microbiological cultures upon
PICU admission. Three children had seizures during
their hospitalization; one of them had febrile
convulsions and the other two manifested seizures after
their extubation.
Conclusions: Now days, most of the neonates treated in
a NICU are immunized against RSV with palivizumab.
That is the reason why the number of neonates having
RSV infection and underlying disease has decreased. A
risk factor for sever RSV infection remain small age.
Very few infants had a bacterial infection as a secondary
infection after RSV bronchiolitis.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae respiratory infections and
their diagnostic.
Methods: In all 33 children diagnosed and treated for
M. pneumoniae respiratory infections, in pneumo-
allergology pediatric service, CHU Tirana, during
period October 2004 - May 2005. Diagnosis of M.
pneumoniae infections is based on positive specific
IgM&IgG antibodies for M. pneumoniae.
Results: In 82 serologic tests done, results that 33 of
them, 40.2% are infected with M. pneumoniae. The age
of sick children varies between 2months-13 years. The
age most affected is between 4-9 years (42.4%), age 1-4
year (21.2%), age 1 month-1 year (18.2%), age 9-14
years (18.2%) of cases. Clinical aspect of M.
pneumoniae infections has been varied:
Bronchopneumonia in 48.5%, pneumonia in 12.1%,
bronchiolitis 18.2%, tracheo-bronchitis 9.1% and
spasmodic cough 12.1% of cases. The essential clinical
sign has been cough in 100% of cases, fever in 30.3% of
cases. Roentgenographic examination has described
interstitial bronchopneumonia in 48.5% of cases,
pneumonic infiltrates in 18.2%, hilar lymphadenopatia
in 18.2%, pleural fluid in 6%, normal aspect in 9.1% of
cases. Positive serology for IgM was in 66.7% and
positive for IgM&IgG in 33.3% of cases, which
demonstrates that a great number of patients have
recidivate infections or have been diagnosed after 1-2
months. In 39.4% of cases M.Pneumoniae infections
have been associated with pathology like TBC, viral
hepatitis, asthma, bronchectasie, leucosis.
Conclusions: It's evident an elevation of M.
pneumoniae respiratory infections. A high percentage of
this infection is presented in infants of first months of
life.

Background and Aims: Modern scientific
investigations in pediatric immunology allowed to
obtain new data concerning pathogenic aspects of
asthma formation. But some questions of clinical and
immunological accordance remain still undiscussed. The
aim of the work was to investigate clinical and
immunological peculiarities of asthma in children.
Methods: Clinical, allergological, instrumental,
immunological (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD23, IgA, M, G, E,
IL-4, -INF) were used.
Results: Constant increase of CD23 cells (p<0.001)
quantity in blood serum in children with asthma was
revealed both in attack and remission period. CD23 cells
content correlates with increase of IgE concentration
- 302 -
( =0.32; p<0.001) and decrease of serum IgA level
( =0.29; p<0.01). The dysbalance of cytokines was
found even if the quantity dispersion of T-cells kept
normal ratio: increase of IL-4 level (p<0.001) and
decrease of . -INF (p<0.01).
Conclusions: Firm immunological changes such as
hypofunction of I type T-helpers and stimulation of II
type T-helpers in children with asthma were found.

Background and Aims: Biotin is a coenzyme for four
carboxylases, intervening in gluconeogenisis, fatty acid
synthesis and amino acid catabolism. The defect in
biotin metabolism has variable manifestations, including
hypotonia, seizures, cutaneous changes, deafness and
alopecia.
Methods: We presented a clinical case of a six month
old boy, referred for single seizure without fever.
Results: He was only son of young, healthy, non-
consanguineous parents. Born by caesarean section at 40
weeks of gestation, Apgar 9/10; CMV seroconversion
during 2nd trimester; CMV antigen in urine was
negative. Ophthalmologic and auditory tests were
normal. Transfontanelar ultrasonography showed small
subependimary haemorrhage, with complete resolution
at 6 months. In the 3rd month, discrete global hypotonia
was described, without other findings. By 6 months he
suffered a single afebrile seizure, with spontaneous
resolution. The clinical observation, EEG and cerebral
MRI where normal; the metabolic study revealed
elevation of ammonia and traces of 3-hidroxi-isovaleric
acid; serum biotiniadse activity was diminished (3,24
nmol/min/ml) - biotinidase deficiency. During this
period it was observed a discrete delay in language area,
without other alteration in growth and development. He
initiated supplementation with biotin 5mg at 14 months
and never had other episode of seizures; now with 25
months he as a completely normal growth and
development for his age.
Conclusions: The biotinidase deficit is a disorder with
gradual manifestations, and may have episodes of
remission, associated with varying degrees of biotin in
diet. This diagnosis must be considered precociously in
children with neurological disorders because late
diagnosed patients often have psychomotor retardation
and permanent neurological damage.

Background and Aims: As there are differences in
cognitive recovery after similar traumatic brain injuries
in childhood, the pathophysiology can not be longer
explained only by the known prognostic factors as:
injury mechanism, -type, -severity and location. Our
study investigated the influence of apolipoprotein (Apo)
E- polymorphism as modulating genetic factor in post-
traumatic regeneration, emphasizing the significance on
cognitive development.
Methods: After an Apo E typing, 38 adults, who had
suffered a severe traumatic brain injury in childhood,
received neurological, cognitive and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) investigations by a standardized
protocol. The mean age of the patients was 23 years
with a mean of 17 years follow- up time after the initial
brain injury.
Results: 8 (21%) had an Apo E4 allele. While they
showed retrospectively a longer and more severe initial
post- traumatic course with longer vigilance
disturbances, no significant differences in neurological
disability and MRI examinations could be found.
Whereas the Apo E4- group showed statistically
significant worse cognitive results in the “Diagnosticum
für Cerebralschädigung (DCS)” and the Hamburg-
Wechsler- intelligence- test (HAWIE), emphasizing
concentration, figural memory skills and staying power.
Conclusions: The ApoE- polymorphism influences the
post- traumatic outcome, increasing the risk of a poorer
cognitive development, specially for concentration,
memory and staying power skills through the ApoE 4-
allele. It therefore implicates a genetically determined,
inborn vulnerability to traumatic brain lesions.
OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE MANAGEMENT
OF THE CADAVERIC ORGAN DONORS IN THE
PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT AND
ANAESTHESIA DURING ORGAN HARVEST
D Blazek, P Pavlicek, D Hechtova, K Dlask
Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care
Medicine, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech
Republic
Background and Aims: In the last years there has been
seen the ever increasing number of the patients awaiting
an organ transplant as the only curative treatment of
their disease shifts the off-age limits of suitable
cadaveric organ donors to both higher age limits (above
age of 60) as well as lower ones in the case of pediatric
donors.
Methods: This report presents authors' experience based
on the care of 36 cadaveric donors since 1993.
Results: The authors suggest some principles of the care
of the potential donor in the pediatric intensive care unit,
specifically in comparison to the care of the adult donor.
A special attention is given to the issues of assessment
of the 'brain death', the tests prior to the PGA and the
actual arrangement of the cerebral PGA. The importance
of the continuity of the intensive care before and also
- 303 -
after establishing the diagnosis of brain death is
emphasized. The stress is put on the ventilation,
cardiovascular system, arrhythmias, hemostasis, body
temperature, infection prevention and intensive
continuous monitoring of the vital functions of both the
recipient and donor. Specific details of anaesthesia
during the procedure are discussed.
Conclusions: In the last section the authors address
variety of sensitive issues regarding legislation, previous
informed consent, the consent of the pediatric patient's
family and the influence of their involvement on the
number of successful donations. They also discuss the
maintenance of the medical record and overall approach
to the management of the pediatric cadaveric donor in
the settings of intensive care unit.

H Boigner, G Mostafa, A Pollak
PICU, University Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria
Background and Aims: Hepatic encephalopathy
remains a harassing challenge in pediatric critical care.
High mortality and the risk of permanent neurological
damage explain the need for a rapid available effective
detoxification procedure particularly if liver
transplantation cannot be carried out in short time.
Albumin dialysis was used successfully in adults for this
indication already.
Methods: In 3 children albumin dialysis was performed
(using the MARS system in two patients and single pass
albumin dialysis in one) to prevent (in one child with
proven mushroom intoxication) and to treat (in two
children suffering from biliary atresia and from
autoimmune hepatitis) hepatic encephalopathy
documented clinically and by EEG.
Results: Values of age and weight of patients were 20, 7
months and 16 years; 15, 8 and 39 kilograms. Values
and admission were: ALAT (133, 3840, 52 U/l),
bilirubin (0,4; 18,89; 1,72 mg/dL), INR (0,97; 5,83;1,9)
and ammonia (21, 75, 84 mcmol/l). All children
survived without neurological deficit.
Conclusions: Albumin dialysis can be performed
successfully also in children in order to prevent or to
treat hepatic encephalopathy.

Background and Aims: Attention Deficit/Hyper-
activity disorder, which affects between 3% and 5% of
children, is characterized by different levels of
hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention that give rise
to important academic, social and emotional problems.
The aim of treatment is to improve symptoms and well
being for the child and close contacts. The authors
propose to study symptoms severity and quality of life
of children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
before and after starting treatment with metylphenidate.
Methods: The sample included 40 children with the
diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder,
aged between 6 and 10 years old, who were referred to
the pediatric development and psychology consultation.
The Conners Questionnaire was answered by parents
and teachers before and one month after the child started
treatment with metylphenidate, to confirm diagnosis and
to evaluate symptoms severity. The Pediatric Quality of
life Inventory was used to measure child's functioning
on four major domains (physical, emotional, social and
academic) and was answered only by parents before and
after starting treatment.
Results: The study evidenced a strong correlation
between symptoms severity and quality of life. In
overall, after starting treatment there was a reduction in
symptoms and improvement in the quality of life,
specially on emotional, social and academic levels.
Conclusions: Attention deficit/Hyperactivity disorder in
children has an important impact on quality of life,
which could substantially interfere with their future.
Both symptoms measurement and knowledge about
those quality of life domains which are mostly affected
are important to define treatment needs.

Background and Aims: Autism and related pervasive
developmental disorders are characterized by patterns of
delay and deviance in the development of social,
communicative and cognitive skills. These conditions
present particular challenges for clinicians and require
care and coordination of multiple professionals. The
authors propose to study clinical features and outcome
of children with diagnosis of autism and related
disorders, two years after starting specific intervention.
Methods: The sample included 80 children with
diagnosis of autism and related disorders. Their clinical
reports were reviewed and data was collected regarding
clinical features, laboratory and imagiological
evaluation, differential diagnosis, treatment plan and
multidisciplinary intervention. The Childhood Autism
Rating Scale, by the time of diagnosis and after two
years of follow-up, has been evaluated. A standardized
parent interview has been performed concerning their
point of view about improvement in social and
communicative behavior and autonomy.
Results: In overall, after starting specific
multidisciplinary intervention, there was an
- 304 -
improvement in problematic behavior, social skills and
relationships, and educational functioning.
Conclusions: Long term evaluation and monitoring of
autistic children requires a team of qualified
professionals: pediatricians, child psychiatrists,
psychologists, therapists and special educators,
establishing goals for educational/social intervention,
symptoms improvement and family counselling and
support.

University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK
Background and Aims: Fetal death in a twin
conception during second and third trimester is
associated with increased risk of cerebral injury in the
surviving twin (ST). The aim of this study is to test the
hypothesis that even early fetal losses, the vanishing
twin (VT), may be associated with an increased risk of
cerebral impairment in the ST.
Methods: 362 pregnant women attending Liverpool
Women's Hospital between May 1999 and May 2001
were recruited. Women were classified according to the
first ultrasound scan into three groups - 1) VT group
2) Twin group 3) Singleton group. VT group is further
classified into 'Definite' and 'Possible'. Children from
these pregnancies were assessed at 1 year of age for
their development and neurological function using the
Griffiths Mental and Developmental Scales and
Optimality score.
Results: Children from 229 pregnancies (63.2%)
attended the assessment. Information on children from
further 21 (5.8%) pregnancies is obtained through a
review of hospital records. Cerebral impairment is noted
in 2 children from VT group, 2 from the Twin group and
none from the singleton group. When cases with
'Definite' VT are considered there is a significant
difference between the VT and singleton group (RR 6.1
[CI 1.5 to 8.3; p= 0.03]).
Conclusions: Although, when cases with 'Definite' VT
were examined, there is a statistically significant
association with cerebral impairment in the ST, it is
possible that this may be a statistical type I error.
Further studies with larger sample size are required to
establish a definitive conclusion.

Background and Aims: AAP made recommendations
about when phototherapy (PT) should be initiated, but
not about when it should be discontinued. We compared
two groups of jaundiced newborns randomized to one of
two targets of bilirubin (TSB) concentration for photo-
discontinuation.
Methods: Term infants under phototherapy were
randomly assigned to two TSB groups for photo-
interruption: a high threshold group (photo-interruption
when bilirubin decreased to 1 mg/dL below the limit for
starting phototherapy and a low threshold group (when
bilirubin decreased to 3 mg/dL below that limit).
Results: Mean bilirubin at phototherapy start was
similar in both groups. Bilirubin rebound at 10 and 28
hours after photo-interruption was similar in both
groups. Phototherapy duration and length of stay were
shorter in the high than in the low threshold group
(p=0.03 and p=0.05, respectively). Re-phototherapy was
needed similarly in both groups. In the presence of
hemolysis or G6PD deficiency, 28% of infants required
re-phototherapy compared with 8.3% when such factors
were not present (p=0.066).
Conclusions: Phototherapy may be shortened by using
higher bilirubin limits for photo-interruption. In
hemolytic or G6PD deficient infants, they should be
followed for longer periods since a substantial number
may need re-phototherapy.

Background and Aims: The onset of infantile spasms
is a neurological emergency requiring urgent treatment.
Recent research indicates a superior efficacy of steroids
over vigabatrin as first line treatment of infantile
spasms, except in infants with Tuberous Sclerosis.
Methods: We describe five infants with serious adverse
effects whilst on synacthen therapy, two of which were
life threatening.
Results: Three infants were diagnosed with idiopathic
infantile spasms and two had pre-existing brain injury.
Age at onset was between 6 weeks and nine months.
Steroids were commenced after vigabatrin in 2 cases
and as third line in 3 cases because of resistant seizures.
We used Synacthen depot 0.5mg alternate days
(equivalent to 40iu ACTH) following the
recommendations of this UK study. All our infants
became seizure free on Synacthen therapy and
hypsarrythmia resolved in all infants. Adverse effects
began between 3 and 8 weeks of treatment and included
excessive weight gain and hypertension in five by day
- 305 -
18, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in four infants by
day 21. Two of these infants had associated respiratory
distress and cardiac failure. Two infants had evidence of
steroid myopathy. All infants required anti hypertensive
therapy. Hypertension and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
resolved on cessation of Synacthen and institution of
beta-blocker and diuretic treatment. Steroid myopathy
and weight gain were more resistant to treatment.
Conclusions: Synacthen is effective in the treatment of
infantile spasms but we would caution against its use
beyond 2-3 weeks. Echocardiography should be
considered in infants who develop hypertension on
steroids.

Korinthos, Korinthos, Greece
Background and Aims: Febrile Seizures (FS) are the
commonest cause of convulsions in children under five
years of age. The purpose of this study was to perform
an analysis of a group of children with FS in order to
determine the correlation between FS and the results of
laboratory examination.
Methods: We reviewed clinical records of 50 children
aged 11 months to 5 years old, who were admitted for
episode of febrile convulsion in our paediatric
department, between January 2004 and December 2005.
We have studied serum levels of sodium, potassium,
calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium and blood levels
of glucose in our sample.
Results: Of the 50 children, 35 had simple and 15 had
complex initial febrile seizures. The median age was 27
months. Total calcium levels were lower in those
children with simple convulsions in comparison with
those having complicated convulsions (9.3+/-1.22mg/dl,
n = 35, and 9.5+/-1.63 mg/dl, n = 15, respectively), but
the serum potassium, phosphorus and magnesium levels
showed no statistically significant differences between
the patient groups. The sodium concentrations were
lowest in children with simple convulsions in
comparison with those having complicated convulsions
(137.22 +/- 2.76mmol/lt and 138.42 +/- 2.58mmol/lt,
respectively). In 72.43% of children blood levels of
glucose were>110 mg/dl.
Conclusions: Serum levels of sodium and calcium were
related to type of febrile convulsions. Blood glucose
levels were significantly elevated in children with
febrile seizures. These findings suggest that electrolytes
serum levels should be measured in all children with
febrile seizures, especially when the history is not clear
or unknown.

Background and Aims: Haemorrhagic stroke in infants
and children represents both an important cause of
morbidity/mortality and an emerging area for clinical
research. Differently from adult cerebrovascular disease,
intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) in pediatrics has
different causes, locations and mechanisms. Our aim is
to analyse the clinical features, risk factors and
outcomes of a large cohort of infants/children with ICH
admitted to a tertiary hospital PICU over a 12-year
period.
Methods: We perform a retrospective review of all non-
traumatic ICH admitted to the PICU of Catholic
University Gemelli Hospital, Rome, between January
1993 and January 2005. Prematurity ICH was ruled out.
During the study period 98 patients with non-traumatic
ICH were admitted. All cases were investigated with
neuroimaging (cerebral CT, MRI or angiography) and
other diagnostic procedures as required.
Results: Vascular malformations accounted for 46% of
ICH admissions (followed by 16% each for
malignancy/coagulopathies, about 11% each for
infections/undetermined). Overall PICU mortality was
24.5% (24/98), largely depending on diagnosis (15.5%
vascular malformations, 50% malignancy, 31.2%
coagulopathies/congenital syndromes, 40% infections,
27.2% undetermined origin). Neurological
impairment/need for respiratory support at presentation
were predictive of poor outcome in PICU.
Conclusions: Epidemiological studies revealed that ICH
resulted as common as ischemic strokes in children,
even when neonatal ICH and traumatic lesions were
ruled out. Recently, an increasing interest regarding ICH
has been raised by innovative therapy introduction (i.e.
recombinant factor VII) for limitation of early
hemorrhage growth, reducing the high risk from
continued bleeding. Further studies are required in
pediatric emergency and intensive care to evaluate its
possible application.

Background and Aims: Measurements of health-
related quality of life is an important issue in epilepsy.
There are actually several psychometric validated scales
in order to evaluate this aspects. Quality of Life in
Epilepsy Inventory for Adolescents (QOLIE-AD-48) it's
a self-reported scale used by adolescents for evaluation
quality of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate
psychometric properties of Romanian version of
QOLIE-AD-48.
Methods: We translated and back translated original
version of QOLIE-AD-48 and adapt culturally for
Romanian people. The 8 subscales - epilepsy impact,
- 306 -
memory/concentration, attitudes toward epilepsy,
physical functioning, stigma, social support, school
behaviour, health perceptions, and a total summary
score were evaluated at 204 Romanian adolescents with
epilepsy.
Results: Internal consistency reliability estimated by
Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.81 for the summary
score and between range of 0.75 to 0.90 for subscales.
We performed test-retest reliability at 3 weeks period
and we found a 0.79 for the summary score. Overall
patients with more severe and more frequent seizures
and lower socioeconomic status reported a poorer
quality of life. We identified risk factors for each of 8
subscales.
Conclusions: Quality of life of epileptic patients could
be measured using the Romanian version of QOLIE-
AD-48 that is a valid instruments. Future studies are
needed to compare this scale with others scales
evaluating quality of life in epilepsy.

Sciences, Imam Ali Hospital, Zahedan, Iran
Background and Aims: Chronic daily headaches can
be a difficult problem in children as well as adults.
About half of the cases of chronic daily headaches in
adults are thought to be due to medication-overuse
headache, and treatment consists of discontinuation of
these analgesics. Since many patients are also treated
with preventive agents at the time of analgesic
withdrawal, it is difficult to determine whether
discontinuation alone is the most effective treatment.
Methods: A prospective study was performed to
evaluate the outcomes of 22 children (ages 5–15 years)
with medication-overuse headache 1 month after
withdrawal of analgesics: 10 children received daily
doses of a preventive medication, and 12 received no
preventive medication. Headache reduction was
assessed 1 month later.
Results: There was no significant difference in the
percentage, with 90% or greater headache reduction at 1
month between children who were solely treated by
withdrawal of analgesic drugs and those receiving
preventive medications (60% vs 54%, respectively). We
did not find any influence of age or gender on outcomes.
A previous duration of headaches over 1 years was
negatively correlated with overall outcome.
Conclusions: We advise discontinuation of analgesics
in all children with medication-overuse headache,
without the necessity for starting daily preventive agents
concurrently. Only if headaches persist after 1 month,
the preventive therapy may be added.
PERIPHERAL PARESIS OF FACIAL NERVE IN
CRETE, GREECE

Heraklion, Crete, Greece
Background and Aims: Peripheral paresis of facial
nerve is usually a complication, of acute or chronic
inflammation of middle ear, but also can be idiopathic.
In rare cases it can be associated with ear herpes Zoster
virus. The aim of the present study is the assessment of
influence of corticosteroids on the physical course of the
facial nerve peripheral paresis in children, admitted to
the referral University Hospital of Heraklion, during the
5-year period 2001-2005 were included. Irrelevantly of
the reason caused the disease, the administration of
corticosteroids seems not to affect hospitalization time
and the decline of symptoms.
Methods: 11 children were studied (9 girls and 2 boys)
with age ranging from 20 months to 11 years (mean
9.02). Blood and virological tests were held in all
children. Ophthalmologic assessment was held in 7
children, otorhinolaryngologic assessment in 9 children,
2 children underwent MRI investigation and CT was
done in 1 child.
Results: Evidence of viral origin was found in 1 (CMV)
and of bacterial origin in 5 (Rickettsia conorii,
Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 3,2 cases respectively). At
5 children, blood and virological results were negative.
Ophthalmologic and otorhinolaryngologic assessment,
CT and MRI did not demonstrate any pathological signs.
Conclusions: More girls were affected by the disease.
Hospitalization term lasted 2 days. Corticosteroids
neither affected the hospitalization time nor seem to
promote the remission of symptoms. None of the
children showed reversion or complications. The disease
isn't characterized by considerable geographic variations
in etiology.
STATUS EPILEPTICUS: A FREQUENT CAUSE
OF ADMISSION IN PICU

G Ladopoulos, M Tamiolaki
PICU Department, Ippokration General Hospital of
Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece
Background and Aims: Status Epilepticus (SE) is a
frequent cause of admission in PICU. In order to
determine the causes of refractory SE as well as to
evaluate the effectiveness of treatment protocols, we
studied retrorpectively the files of patients admitted to
our PICU with the diagnosis of SE in a 3 years period.
Methods: During the last 3 years, 44 patients were
admitted to our PICU with SE, a number that reflects
10% of total admissions. Thirty four (78%) of these
patients were transported sedated and incubated from
other hospitals. Midazolam was the main anesthetic
agent used. Effectiveness of treatment was confirmed by
clinical criteria and continuous EEG monitoring.
Results: Acute symptomatic SE mainly due to CNS
infection was documented in 20 cases (45,4%),
idiopathic SE in 2 cases (4.5%) and febrile SE in 8 cases
(18,1%). SE as manifestation of chronic neurological
disorder was observed in 14 cases (31,8%). Eight
patients were intubated because of respiratory
depression and the rest because of refractory SE. There
were 4 deaths, 4 patients recovered without other
- 307 -
anticonvulsant treatment and 36 patients recovered with
one or more anticonvulsant medications.
Conclusions: CNS infection and chronic neurological
disorders are the main causes of SE in children. First
line treatment is often not fully applied because of
respiratory depression or fear of IV administration of a
benzodiazepine in the upsence of proper monitoring. As
a result a conciderably high number of patients are
intubated, sedated and transported to PICU.
POSTERIOR CRANIAL FOSSA TUMOR

Departament of Pediatrics, Hospital São João, Porto,
Portugal
Background and Aims: The eradication of congenital
syphilis has remained an elusive goal of public health
policy. Wordwide, syphilis remains as a significant
cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality.
Neurosyphilis is believed to occur in 60 percent of these
infants. Neurosyphilis is a pleomorphic disease, causing
clinical pictures that occasionally mimic other better
known neurological diseases.
Methods: The authors present a clinical case of a six
year-old girl, brought to the emergency department
complaining of headaches, balance disturbances,
dysarthria and vomiting, that evolved for the course of
three weeks. Initial cerebral computerized tomography
scan showed a posterior cranial fossa lesion, with mass
effect.
Results: Complementary study was performed in order
to rule out neoplastic and inflammatory/infectious
disease. CSF examination by polymerase chain reaction
was positive for Treponema pallidum and
hystopathologic findings of the brain biopsy suggested
features of syphilitic gumma. The treatment consisted of
Penicilin G and dexametasone, with favorable clinical
and imagiologic outcome.
Conclusions: Cerebral gumma is considered a rare
complication of neurosyphilis in children. The authors'
intention is to emphasize the importance of considering
the diagnosis of syphilitic gumma in children with
neurologic symptoms and a previous history of
congenital syphilis. Polymerase chain reaction has
proven to be a useful tool in establishing this often
difficult diagnosis.

Heraklion, Heraklion, Crete, Greece
Background and Aims: The optimal treatment of
refractory convulsive status epilepticus (RCSE) has not
been defined. The aim of our study was to determine the
characteristics and treatment modalities in the
management of RCSE in a PICU.
Methods: Nineteen children with RCSE are described.
The incidence was 2.7% of total admissions in a five
year period and the age at the onset ranged between 40
days and 14 years (12 girls, 7 boys). Clinical
characteristics and treatment algorithms were correlated
with the need for mechanical ventilation (MV), length of
stay (LOS) and length of MV (LOMV).
Results: The most frequent primary diseases were
neurodegenerative diseases (38.9%) and
encephalitis/encephalopathy (33.3%), mostly presented
as generalized refractory status (72.2%). Five (27.8%)
children were controlled with phenytoin, phenobarbital,
or valproate. The third line anticonvulsive treatment in
PICU included continuous midazolam infusion 44.4%,
high dose phenobarbital 5.6%, and propofol or pentothal
(burst suppression coma) 16.7%. Half of the patients
required MV (50%), 16.7% had >4 days LOMV and
21.1% >10 days LOS. None of the patients died.
Regarding the need for MV, only primary disease
(p<.05) and degree of anticonvulsive treatment (p<.04)
differ significantly. In a logistic regression model, only
primary disease was independently correlated with the
need for mechanical ventilation support (p<.0001).
Conclusions: Third-line treatment is used in ¾ of
children with RCSE. The need for mechanical
ventilation is influenced by primary disease and the
degree of treatment. An ideal new drug for RCSE
having the ability to stop seizures more effectively and
safely than current drugs is urgently needed.

PICU, Hippokration Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece
Background and Aims: The use of continuous EEG
monitoring has been proposed for evaluation of
increased ICP, ischemic events, level of sedation, status
epilepticus, non convulsive seizures, metabolic
disorders, intracerebral tumors and all etiologies of
coma. We present the use of continuous EEG
monitoring with the Infinity Express EEG pod, Siemens
SC 9000 XL monitor in the assessment of treatment
results in patients with status epilepticus treated in our
PICU.
Methods: Continuous EEG monitoring was applied in 8
patients aged from 2 months to 9 years admitted in our
ICU during the last two years. Status epilepticus was the
main symptom in all patients and the underlying disease
was encephalitis in 2 patients, metabolic disorder in 1,
hypoxic encephalopathy in 1, sepsis in 1 and in 3
patients no profound etiology was found. All patients
needed sedation and mechanical ventilation.
Results: Continuous EEG monitoring proved to be
useful in determining the duration and level of
pentobarbital coma needed in 3 of our patients with
intractable status epilepticus. It also helped in the
recognition of subclinical seizures in 5 patients.
Continuous EEG monitoring proved to be valuable for
the evaluation of anticonvulsant treatment with
combination of 3 drugs in 3 patients, 2 drugs in 1 patient
and 1 drug in 4 patients. It has also proved the
- 308 -
effectiveness of pyridoxine administration as
anticonvulsive therapy in 3 patients < 1 year old.
Conclusions: Continuous EEG monitoring provided
valuable information about subclinical seizures,
effectiveness of treatment and level of anesthesia in our
patients.

Background and Aims: Finapres technology allows for
continuous non-invasive measurement of finger blood
pressure and has proven to be accurate in adults. A
prototype pediatric device (PFINAP) has been
developed and accuracy in children has been
demonstrated in an earlier study. Aim of this study was
to assess the adequacy of PFINAP in detecting blood
pressure changes in children.
Methods: Fifteen anesthetized children with a median
age of 11 months (2 months – 7 years) and a median
body weight of 10 kg (4 – 31) undergoing congenital
cardiac surgery were included in the study. PFINAP and
intra arterial blood pressure (IAP) were recorded
simultaneously during the procedure. The four largest
IAP variations within a 5 minute interval were identified
from each procedure. Afterwards, PFINAP was
compared with IAP for these blood pressure changes.
Results: In 17 of 27 attempts (63%) a non-invasive
signal was obtainable. The average bias (PFINAP –
IAP) for mean arterial pressure was –8,8 mmHg (SD
7,2). The figure shows the changes in PFINAP
compared to the changes in IAP for mean arterial
pressure. The correlation is 0.98 (spearman) with p <
0.0001.
Conclusions: This prototype pediatric Finapres device
closely follows arterial blood pressure changes in
children. However, further technical development is
necessary before clinical application is feasible during
surgery.

Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Radboud
University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The
Netherlands
Background and Aims: Cardiac output (CO)
measurement in critically ill children is cumbersome,
but may improve hemodynamic management. Following
a primary calibration, arterial pulse contour cardiac
output (PCCO) provides a fast and accurate beat-to-beat
measurement of CO in adults with special relevance to
changes in CO. Aim of this study was to determine the
accuracy of PCCO in critically ill small children.
Methods: We prospectively studied 13 mechanically
ventilated and sedated children with a median age of 2.3
years (2 months - 8 years) in our paediatric intensive
care unit. Transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) with
ice cold saline was considered clinical gold standard.
Measurements were performed using the PiCCOplus
system with software version 6 (Pulsion Medical
Systems) incorporating both PCCO and TPTD
techniques. PCCO and TPTD were recorded
simultaneously and relative changes were compared at
various intervals.
Results: A total of 144 paired measurements were
analysed. Mean CO was 2,2 l/min (0.5 – 5.3 l/min).
With a mean interval of 7 hours (10 min – 47 hrs)
changes in PCCO were compared to changes in TPTD.
The figure shows these relative changes. The correlation
coefficient (Pearson) was 0.5 (p < 0.01).
Conclusions: In critically ill children the arterial pulse
contour method is not an accurate method to track
changes in cardiac output.

Background and Aims: The few studies conducted in
children suggest that BNP could be a useful biomarker
in the diagnosis and follow-up of cardiac function after
surgery. The aim of the present study was to measure
BNP in children undergoing cardiac surgery and to
evaluate its relationship with their clinical outcome.
Methods: Prospective observational study in 55
consecutive patients admitted to the pediatric intensive
care unit (PICU) after cardiac surgery. BNP levels were
determined by an inmunochemiluminiscent assay
(ADVIA Centaur, Bayer) at four different times: before
surgery (T0) and on first, second and third day after
surgery (T1, T2, T3). BNP concentrations were
examined in relation to: mean duration of PICU stay
(MS), days on mechanical ventilation (MV), inotropic
score (IS) ( gr/Kg/min dopamine x1+dobutamine x1+
epinephrine x100) and worst PELOD score (PS) at 24,
48 and 72 hours following surgery. Data are shown as
median (P25-P75), differences were assessed by the
Mann-Whitney U test and correlation between variables
by Spearman rank correlation test.
Results: We found that postoperative maximum BNP
values were significantly correlated with clinical
parameters of severity. Furthermore, those patients who
stayed at the PICU > 4 days, were on MV > 24h, with IS
> 5, lactate >2 mmol/L or PELOD score > 11 showed
higher BNP concentrations in the early postoperative
period.
Conclusions: BNP levels on the first day after surgery
were related with the severity of heart failure. Therefore,
postoperative BNP could be a useful marker in the
assessment and management of cardiac function in
pediatric patients.

Background and Aims: The aim of the present study
was the analysis of blood pressure regulation in children
and adolescents after treatment with cardiotoxic
antracyclines for oncological diseases.
Methods: Thirty one subjects treated with antracycline
(A) and 11 subjects treated with different drugs (nonA)
were investigated twice (interval between investigations
from 1 to 9 years) in the range between 1 and 18 years
after the treatment. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was
determined from 5 minutes beat-to-beat recording of
systolic (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and inter-
beat intervals (IBI). The values of all these parameters
were compared with the values obtained by the identical
method in 339 healthy children and adolescents (N).
Because the investigated subjects were of different age
the measured values were normalized for age 16 years
by linear regression and only normalized values were
further analyzed.
Results: There was no difference between A, nonA and
N in BRS and IBI. SBP and DBP were significantly
lower in A (A: 102.±10.7/59.7±8.9 versus N:
114.1±12.4/69.0±9.5 mmHg; p<0.001/p<0.001; mean
from two investigations). SBP but not DBP was also
lower in nonA (102.7±15.2/64.5±11.9 mmHg;
p<0.01/no significant) than in N. The correlation
coefficient between time after treatment and SBP in A
was -0.11 in SBP (insignificant), and -0.06 in DBP
(insignificant). It indicates that there is not a trend to the
normalization.
Conclusions: The anthracyline oncological therapy in
children decreases SBP and DBP and within 20 years
after treatment there is not a trend toward normal values.
BRS was not influenced by antracycline treatment.

Background and Aims: The risk of impaired
neurodevelopmental outcome remains a challenge in the
treatment of very premature infants. Disturbances of
cerebral blood flow play an important role in the
pathogenesis of intraventricular haemorrhage and
periventricular leukomalacia. A patent ductus arteriosus
(PDA) may cause hypoperfusion of the immature brain.
Kluckow et al. have shown that systemic blood flow can
be estimated by measuring flow in the superior vena
cava (SVC). The aim of this study was to gather
experience with this method, and to investigate the
relation between ductal flow and SVC-flow in healthy
term infants.
Methods: Healthy term infants were enrolled
consecutively during spring 2005 and underwent
echocardiographic investigation on the first, second and
third day of life. SVC-flow was measured according to
the method of Kluckow et al.
Results: 49 infants (25 male) were enrolled. Median
gestational age was 41 weeks and mean birthweight was
3670 g. 27 complete data sets were evaluated. Reasons
for dropout were pneumothorax (1), VSD (1),
phototherapy (3), early discharge (1), and various
technical problems (16). Mean SVC-flow was 59, 52
and 45 ml/kg/min on the first, second and third day. On
day one, there was a trend towards increasing SVC-flow
with decreasing ductal flow.
Conclusions: With some practice, SVC-flow
measurement can be performed as part of a standard
neonatal echocardiographic investigation. In healthy
term infants with normal closure of the duct, SVC-flow
seems to be rather constant during the first three days of
life. Further studies are needed to investigate the
influence of a PDA on SVC-flow.

HIGH FREQUENCY OSCILLATORY
VENTILATION DOES NOT IMPAIR CARDIAC
OUTPUT IN INFANTS WITH ISOLATED
RESPIRATORY FAILURE
J Brierley, T Thiruchelvam, M Peters
Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street
Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: The impact of the higher mean
airway pressure (MAP) during high frequency
oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) compared to
conventional ventilation on haemodynamics remains
uncertain. HFOV may decrease right ventricular venous
return due to higher intrathoracic pressures or lost
respiratory muscle pump. Newer non-invasive
techniques allow accurate haemodynamics in smaller
children than previously possible. We hypothesised
HFOV would have no significant impact on Cardiac
Output (CO) expressed-Cardiac Index=CO/body surface
area (CI) or Blood Pressure (BP).
Methods: Ten isolated respiratory failure infants had
baseline haemodynamic assessment before HFOV and
after 1 and 5 mins of HFOV using continuous wave
non-invasive Doppler ultrasound. (USCOM).
Diagnoses: 6 RSV, 1 metapneumovirus, 1 adenovirus
and 2 pneumococcal pneumonia. No volume
administered or inotropes (all< 5mcg/kg/min dopamine)
altered during study.
Results: MAP pre =19.7 + 2.8 post = 21.6 + 2.4. Mean
change of cardiac index from baseline -0.03 l/min/m2
(95%CI= -0.15 to +0.08, p=0.63, paired t-test) at 1 min,
and -0.07 (-0.21 to + 0.07, p=0.4) at 5 mins
Conclusions: No statistically or clinically significant
impact of HFOV on CO is shown as measured HFOV
effects fall within expected errors of the technique. The
increased MAP and effects of HFOV mechanics do not
decrease CO in infants with single-organ respiratory
failure. Concerns over deleterious effects of HFOV on
CO appear unfounded in cardiovascularly stable infants,
despite high MAPS. Although some fall in BP occurred
this is not the important parameter.

Background and Aims: B-type natriuretic peptide
(BNP) and pro-atrial natriuretic (pro-BNP) are both
secreted by the atrium in response to volume loading.
BNP is useful in predicting the magnitude of shunting
through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature
neonates. We hypothesized that pro-BNP may be useful
in the early diagnosis of a PDA and in monitoring
treatment response.
Methods: Preterm neonates with weights <1500g and
</=30 weeks underwent an echocardiogram on day 1
and day 3 of life coupled with a pro-BNP assay.
Neonates who did not have a PDA underwent a repeat
echo and BNP measurement on day 5. In patients who
received treatment for a PDA, an echo and BNP were
repeated 48 hours after completion of treatment.
Results: A total of 14 neonates [mean (SD) weight
1083g (259), mean gestation 27 weeks (1.8)] had a total
of 39 paired echocardiographs and Pro-BNP levels
assays. Infants that required PDA treatment had a
significantly higher pro-BNP level (pmol/L) on day 3 of
life which decreased post treatment to levels similar to
the non PDA group.
Conclusions: Elevated Pro-BNP is a good early
predictor of the presence of a haemodynamically
significant duct. Day one levels may have a role in
predicting which neonates will develop a PDA.
Successful closure of PDA is reflected by a decrease in
the pro-BNP levels to values comparable to those of
neonates with no duct and may have a role in replacing
echo to confirm duct closure.

Background and Aims: Patent Ductus Arteriosus
(PDA) is a significant cause of morbidity in premature
neonates. We aim to assess the significance of LVO in
maintaining good perfusion in the descending aorta
(DAo) and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) in
premature neonates and demonstrate the negative impact
of a PDA on systemic blood flow in the setting of poor
LVO.
Methods: Premature neonates less than 1500g were
included in this prospective observational study.
Echocardiographic evaluation was carried out on days 1,
3 and 5 of life. In neonates requiring treatment of PDA,
a further echo was carried out to confirm closure. LVO,
systolic and mean velocities of the SMA and DAo were
measured.
- 311 -
Results: 14 neonates underwent 42 echos with 126
measurements of LVO coupled with DAo and SMA
flow. 6 neonates improved their LVO in the first three
days of life compared to 8 neonates that that did not
[mean (SD) birth weight 1.127g (209), and 1.016g (204)
respectively]. Poor LVO was associated with reduced
systolic and mean velocities of SMA and DAo and
increased incidence of absent end diastolic flow.
Conclusions: LVO up-regulation in the first 3 days of
life may be vital to improve systemic perfusion in
preterm neonates. Failure of LVO up-regulation is
associated with reduced superior mesenteric and
descending aorta perfusion. The presence of a PDA in
the setting of a poor LVO exacerbates this phenomenon.
DIURESIS FOLLOWING INDOMETHACIN
TREATMENT IN PRETERM INFANTS WITH
PERSISTENT DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS IS
DEPENDENT ON FLUID INTAKE BEFORE
TREATMENT
C M Lameijer, M van Stuijvenberg, A F Bos
Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology,
University Medical Center, Groningen, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Indomethacin treatment leads
to a transient decline in diuresis in many preterm
infants. Administration of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors to
hypovolaemic patients bears a significant risk of renal
failure. The severity of side-effects following
indomethacin treatment in preterm infants might be
influenced by fluid management. The aim of this study
was to determine the relationship between fluid intake
before and diuresis following indomethacin treatment
for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).
Methods: We retrospectively studied all preterm infants
born in 2004 and admitted to the NICU, University
Medical Centre Groningen, who were treated with
indomethacin for PDA. Fluid intake and diuresis were
determined on a daily basis, from 2 days before
indomethacin treatment up to 5 days after treatment.
Results: 24 preterm infants were included, gestational
age median 28 w (range: 25-31 w), birth weight median
993 g (range: 675-1840 g). Following indomethacin
treatment, diuresis decreased in all infants to a minimum
of (median) 48 ml/kg/24h (range 13-98 ml/kg/24h) on
day 1 (range 0-4 days). A lower fluid intake before
treatment was associated with a stronger decline in
diuresis on day 1 to 4 following treatment (Spearman’s
r=0.545, p=0.011 for fluid intake 2 days before and
r=0.670, p<0.001 for fluid intake 1 day before
treatment). Gestational age, postnatal day of treatment
with indomethacin and success of ductal closure did not
influence the severity of the decline in diuresis.
Conclusions: A higher fluid intake before indomethacin
treatment might reduce the severity of the decline in
diuresis after treatment.

Background and Aims: Severe pertussis in young
infants remains difficult to treat. Pertussis is prevalent in
New Zealand and thus many infants are hospitalised
with severe pertussis. The study aims were to describe
children with pertussis who required intensive care.
Methods: An audit in Auckland, New Zealand, of all
pertussis admissions to the national paediatric intensive
care unit (PICU) 1991-2003.
Results: 72 children were admitted to PICU, 97% <12
months old. The annual number increased with time
(p = 0.04). 40 children (56%) had coughed for <8 days
before admission. Apnoea or paroxysmal cough were
present in 33 (83%) of these 40. Of the 72 children 19%
were readmitted to PICU. Those readmitted presented
with more atypical disease, had a shorter first admission
but longer total PICU admission (9 versus 5 days,
p=0.009). 35 (49%) children received assisted
ventilation. 4 children died. 9 of 58 children from
Auckland either died (3), or had subsequent respiratory
or neurodevelopmental problems (6). There was an
increased risk (RR, 95% CI) of death or disability
associated with an elevated lymphocyte count (5.26,
1.48-12.85), seizures or encephalopathy (5.38, 1.54-
8.44), shock (6.80, 2.22-8.95), abnormal neurological
signs (8.82, 3.10-14.56), readmission to PICU (4.31,
1.36-8.41), intubation/ventilation (14.43, 3.64-31.24),
and receiving inotropes (14.33, 1.73-16.41) or nitric
oxide (8.80, 3.50-10.98).
Conclusions: Apnoea and paroxysmal cough are key
symptoms in those with shorter cough duration. Death
or disability are frequent. Clinical factors define
children at increased risk of these poor outcomes. Early
discharge from PICU is associated with an increased
risk of readmission and poor outcome.

Background and Aims: The aim of the study is to
evaluate the effects of autologues fibrin glue use after
tonsillectomy.
Methods: Two groups of patients underwent
tonsillectomy in endotracheal anesthesia. All patients
were previously tested on coagulation status/disorders.
In all 22 patients of the first group, immediately after
- 312 -
tonsillectomy, tonsillar fossae were filled up with
autologues fibrin glue with 4% Lidocaine. Three of the
patients had some coagulation disorders (extended
protrombine time or extended partial trombine time). In
20 patients of second group, mono or bipolar electro-
cutter to stop bleeding, was used.
Results: Wong-Baker pain scale was used for
postoperative pain prediction after operation and during
first four postoperative days, in regular time periods.
Bleeding within 24 hours after operation, were
considered as early postoperative bleeding.
Postoperative pains in patients of the first group last 2-3
days and after that time were very week, while in second
group pains last 7 to 10 days. There were no
postoperative bleeding in both groups.
Conclusions: These results suggest that the use of
autologues fibrin glue with lidocaine applied in tonsillar
fossae after tonsillectomy reduce postoperative pains
and period to normal nourishment. Haemostatic effect of
autologues fibrin glue has shown as perfect, without
early and postoperative bleeding even in patients with
coagulation disorders.

Background and Aims: After impressive results in the
treatment of respiratory failure in preterm infants, naturl
surfactant has been proposed in lung pathologies
involving suspected surfactant deficiency: bronchiolitis,
pneumonia, aspiration and chest trauma, which can lead
to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Methods: A.D., an 18 months-old infant, had febrile
seizure and loss of conscience. At the admission he was
connected to the ventilator limiting tindal volume of less
than 8ml/kg; fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.6;
peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of less then 36 mm
mmHg, ventilation rate of 36 b/min. The chest x ray was
characterized by aspiration syndrome and pneumotorax.
The severe respiratory distress and the ventilatory
parameters led us to consider the use of surfactant. We
supply surfactant by intratracheal instillation at the dose
of 0.5ml/kg (CUROSURF).
Results: It was observed a rapid and persistent
improvement after the somministration of surfactant
during the first 4 hours. In fact, after 4 hours we could
modify ventilatory parameters using FiO2 values near
the 0.21 and using CPAP ventilation. Even the X ray
was clearly improved. The patient was extubated and he
was discharged three days after.
Conclusions: Surfactant dysfunction probably plays a
role in the pathophysiology of severe paediatric ARDS
triggered by pneumonia, or aspiration syndrome etc., as
it was found that surfactant instillation rapidly improved
gas exchange in many cases of infants and children as
described in literature. Larger randomized controlled
studies are necessary to evaluate the effects of surfactant
treatment on morbidity and mortality.

(glaucoma, retinal ablation and retrobulbar mass).
Methods: Six year old girl with incontinentio pigmenti,
neonatal diagnosed and eye complications. The
diagnoses was performed by clinical signs and
laboratory methods dermal biopsy, EKG, X-rays of
chest, ultrasound, MRI and genetic analyses).
Results: A 6 year girl was first observed neonatal.
Blisters and erythema in linear fashion were present.
Dermal histology showed acantotic Malpighi structures,
intracellular edema and vesicles filled with eosinofils.
The perivesicular epiderm was filled with eosinophil
cells, as well as the upper and middle dermis. At the age
of 6 year she has normal stature (75 percentile on the
growth curve), bird facies and long and hyperextensive
fingers. Rare teeth were also noted. The hair is thin and
moderately sparse. Two supernumerary nipples are
present under the normal ones. Additionally she was
found to have mitral valve prolapse (EKG, X-rays of the
chest, ultrasound). Left eye glaucoma (treated with anti-
glaucomatous drugs) was found. Retinal ablatia was also
present on the same glaucomatous eye. Retrobulbar
tumorous mass with features of connective tissue was
found on ultrasound and MRI. The family history was
uneventful. Genetic diagnosis for the eventual IP2 type
(NEMO gene) is pending.
Conclusions: The association between IP and
glaucoma, retinal ablation and retrobulbar mass is of
interest because of the combination of these rare
conditions.

Italy
Background and Aims: MELAS (mitochondrial
myopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) is a
fairly common metabolic syndrome characterised by
various clinical manifestations. The majority of patients
with MELAS are adults younger than 40 years. A
relatively small number of diagnoses have been
confirmed on the basis of muscle biopsy in childhood,
while diagnosis is rarely performed in infancy. We
describe a young infant with an abrupt and fatal onset of
MELAS.
Methods: The subject was a 4-month female infant,
born at term by consanguineous parents. The neonatal
period was uneventful. Family history revealed a sister
- 313 -
who died at 2 years of age with MELAS and respiratory
failure. Muscle biopsy showed multiple enzymatic
deficits of respiratory chain complexes (I, II, III, IV and
citrate synthase).
Results: The patient was referred to our Unit for a
stroke-like episode with loss of conscience, circulatory
failure, seizures and apnoea. On day 1, CT scan and
cerebral MRI revealed severe bilateral parieto-temporo-
occipital ischemic lesions. Main laboratory findings
included lactic acidosis, hypoglicemia, AST/ALT
elevation and progressive renal failure. No signs of
sepsis were found. Despite aggressive treatment, the
patient died on day 7, due to progressive multiple organ
failure. Muscle biopsy showed the same multiple
deficits of respiratory chain complexes found in the
patient’s sister.
Conclusions: Stroke and fatal multiorgan failure in
infants may be a sudden presentation of a mitochondrial
disease. MELAS should be suspected in any infant with
these symptoms. Once the diagnosis is confirmed,
aggressive treatment must be attempted and genetic
counselling to parents provided.
HAEMOPHAGOCYTIC
LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS AND PAEDIATRIC
INTENSIVE CARE ADMISSIONS
O Kapellou, P Lister
PICU, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust,
London, UK
Background and Aims: Haemophagocytic Lympho-
histiocytosis (HLH) is a rare cause of Multi Organ
Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS). Our data of patients
with HLH admitted to intensive care from January 1993
to January 2001 showed poor outcome, despite
treatment, with 15 out of 16 children dying due to
multiorgan failure. Recently an overall survival of
58.5% was reported after haematopoietic stem cell
transplantation. We wanted to review outcomes over the
last 5 years and compare to the earlier period.
Methods: Retrospective review of the medical records
of children admitted to PICU with HLH from February
2001 to March 2006.
Results: We identified 14 patients with 19 admission
episodes. They all had failure of 2 or more organ
systems on admission. 5 patients died during their
admission. All the death episodes had 4 or more systems
failing on admission in PICU. 3 of the 5 newly
diagnosed patients died. 3 of the deaths were during the
first PICU admission. 3 had Bone Marrow transplant
and survived their admission.
Conclusions: There seems to be an improvement in the
episode outcome of the PICU admissions with MODS
due to HLH.
UTILITY OF OESOPHAGEAL DOPPLER
MONITORING IN FLUID MANAGEMENT IN
PAEDIATRIC SEPTIC SHOCK
R Chhabra, P Maheshwari, A Desai, S Nadel,
D P Inwald
PICU, St Mary's Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: To determine the utility of
oesophageal Doppler monitoring in the assessment and
management of fluid status in paediatric septic shock.
Methods: 8 patients with inotrope-dependent septic
shock were studied, with a median age of 12 months
(range 6 months-2 years) and weight of 10 kg (5-12 kg).
A KDP72 oesophageal Doppler probe (Deltex Medical,
UK) was inserted. Stroke volume and cardiac output
were calculated from aortic blood flow velocity using
nomograms based on age, weight and height. Flow time
corrected for heart rate (FTc), which provides an index
of preload, was also measured. The patients received 16
boluses of 4.5% albumin solution (10mls/kg) prescribed
on the basis of decreased FTc, indicative of
hypovolaemia. Heart rate (HR, bpm), mean arterial
blood pressure (MAP, mmHg), lactate (mmol/l), cardiac
index (CI, l/min/m2) and FTc (ms) were recorded before
and after the fluid bolus. Inotropic support remained
unchanged between paired measurements.
Results: Administration of fluid was associated with
significant increases in FTc from 307 (+7) to 332 (+10),
p=0.0008 (mean + 95% confidence limits, paired t-test),
CI from 3.17 (+0.31) to 3.55 (+0.33), p=0.01 and MAP
from 58 (+6) to 62 (+5), p=0.02. There were significant
decreases in HR from 163 (+9) to 158 (+8), p=0.02 and
lactate from 1.6 (+0.3) to 1.4 (+0.3), p=0.003. Increase
in FTc following fluid correlated with increase in CI
(p=0.02).
Conclusions: These findings support the use of the
oesophageal Doppler monitoring in the management of
fluid status in septic shock in children.

ACTIVITY (UK) 1998 - 2003 AS RECORDED BY
THE HOSPITAL EPISODE STATISTICS
DATABASE
H Livingston, S M Whiteley
Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, St James's University
Hospital, Leeds, UK
Background and Aims: The hospital episode statistics
database 1 (HES) provides information on all inpatients
admitted to NHS hospitals in England from 1989
onwards. We examined the data held in relation to PICU
admissions, to identify trends in activity and PICU
outcome.
Methods: A search strategy was devised to identify the
number of admissions to general paediatric intensive
care units for the period 1998-2003. The data was
stratified for age, mode of original admission to both
hospital and PICU (acute/elective), source of admission
to PICU and mortality.
Results: The HES query returned large quantities of
useful data. Key findings are shown below.
Conclusions: The hospital episode statistics database
provides useful information describing the activity of
paediatric critical care facilities throughout England.
This data will provide a useful comparison to the
prospective data set being collected by the UK
Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANET).

Background and Aims: A reliable highly spesific and
sensitive marker which could be helpful in neutropenic
fever is needed. This study was planned to evaluate the
diagnostic value of C-reactive protein (CRP),
interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor- (TNF- ),
interleukin-1 (IL-1), procalcitonin (PCT), erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) in pediatric neutropenic fever
patients with documented infection and no documented
infections (FUO).
Methods: We have evaluated the diagnostic value of the
parameters in determining the infection and optimum
time to collect samples in febrile episodes of 20
different neutropenic patients.
Results: When serum levels of all parameters at the
0,8,24 and 48th hours of administration at hospital were
compared in documented infections and FUO, we found
no statistically significant difference in both group and
sequential analysis did not show any difference in both
group. There is no significant difference in all
parameters in all durations found in the patients with
short (< 7 days) and long ( 7 days) duration of
neutropenia. The PCT levels in all time period were
found to be stastistically significantly higher in patients
with fever lasting more than 3 days when compared to
the patients with fever less than 3 days.
Conclusions: All of the reactants failed to differentiate
the patients with FUO and documented infections or
estimate the duration of neutropenia, severity of the
disease and duration of fever. Only PCT levels were
found to be useful in prediction of duration of fever. For
this reason, multicentral large studies with should be
done to determine the exact place of PCT in neutropenic
fever.

Background and Aims: In vitro studies have shown
that carotenoids are antioxidants and immune
modulators. VLBW infants may be deficient in
carotenoids since carotenoids are not present in total
parenteral nutrition (TPN), the main feeding source of
these infants in the first week of life. We studied the role
of carotenoids as antioxidants and have shown that low
beta-carotene intake and plasma levels are associated
with an increased incidence of BPD. In this study we
evaluated the role of carotenoids as immune modulators
and studied whether carotenoid levels are related to the
occurrence of late onset sepsis (LOS).
Methods: Plasma concentrations of - and -carotene,
lycopene, lutein, vitamin A and the vitamin
E/cholesterol ratio were studied at days 1, 3, 7 and 21 in
a group of 109 preterm infants: 76 control, 33 with LOS.
LOS was defined as clinical or culture proven sepsis > 3
days of age.
Results: In the LOS group gestational age did not differ,
birth weight was lower and TPN duration was longer
(all p<0.001); concentrations of vitamin A (day 7,
p<0.001) and -carotene (day 3, p<0.004; day 7,
p<0.001) were lower. Concentrations of lycopene,
lutein, -carotene and vitamin E/cholesterol ratios did
not differ between groups.
Conclusions: Low concentrations of -carotene and
vitamin A are associated with an increased risk of LOS
and supplementation in TPN may be necessary. Since
other carotenoids did not differ between groups, we
speculate that lower concentrations of -carotene and
vitamin A in LOS infants cannot only be due to longer
TPN duration.
BIOELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE ANALYSIS AND
SERUM LEPTIN IN HEALTHY INFANTS IN THE
FIRST YEAR OF LIFE: RELATION TO THE
KIND OF EARLY FEEDING

C Guidi, E Palumeri, R Oggero, R Miniero
Department of Pediatrics, “Regina Margherita”
Children’s Hospital, Torino, Italy
Background and Aims: Bioelectrical impedance
analysis (BIA) estimates body composition through the
measurement of resistance (R), reactance (Xc) and
phase angle (PA). R is high in adipose tissue, Xc and PA
are indicators of body cellular mass. Leptin, mainly
synthesized by the adipose tissue, is also produced by
mammary epithelial cells and secreted into breast milk.
We studied the relationships between serum leptin
concentration and BIA measurements in infants in the
first year of life according to the kind of early feeding.
Methods: We studied 90 healthy term infants aged 0-12
months, 48 exclusively breast fed (BF) for at least 4
months and 42 formula fed (FF). Serum leptin
concentration was determined by RIA test; BIA was
performed by a single-frequency, phase-sensitive
impedance analyser.
Results: In FF infants aged 0-4 months we observed a
negative correlation between leptin and Xc (n=23; r=-
0.421; P=0.045) and leptin and PA (r=-0.521; P=0.011).
- 315 -
In BF infants aged 8-12 months a negative correlation
between leptin and R (n=20; r=-0.521; P=0.018)
emerged.
Conclusions: Diet-related differences in serum leptin
concentration (1) and the different correlations observed
in BF and FF infants between serum leptin and BIA
parameters support a possible influence of early feeding
on body composition later in life. We might speculate
that only in FF infants serum leptin could be an
indicator of fat mass, because BF ones receive an
exogenous source of leptin from breast milk.

Background and Aims: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) - is
characterized by early airway inflammation and
recurrent respiratory infections. The aim of study was to
evaluate the relationships between lung infections and
production of main cytocines of Th1 and Th2 –
lymphocytes- IFN- and IL-4 in CF children with
obstructive syndrome.
Methods: Levels of IL-4 and IFN- and total IgE in
serum were detected by ELISA method.
Results: Frequency of S.aureus infection (71,4%) was
higher than Ps. aeruginosa infection (28,6%, p<0,05) in
children with moderate CF. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
was predominant pathogen in CF children with severe
obstructive syndrome (100%). The total IgE
concentration in serum of these patients was 4-5 times
higher than in the healthy children. Opposite the normal
level of IgE was in 35% of CF patients with S.aureus.
Significant increasing of IL-4 in serum in children with
severe obstructive syndrome compared with moderate
and healthy children was shown. In the same time the
level of IFN- was higher in moderate obstructive lung
syndrome (Table N1).
Conclusions: These date, whilst confirming the
importance of Th1-type CD4 cells and IFN- in
moderate course of CF, also suggest that the presence of
Th2 lymphocytes may contribute to tissue damage
associated with Ps.aeruginosa chronic lung infection.

Background and Aims: The combined treatment with
gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRH)
and growth hormone (GH) has been beneficial in
increasing final height in girls with precocious or early
puberty with or without GH deficiency and in girls with
ISS. The hope that interrupting puberty might increase
adult height has led to the thought of using combined
treatment in girls with Turner syndrome (TS) and
spontaneous puberty (SP).
Methods: Three girls with TS and SP were involved.
They started treatment with GH at the age of diagnosis
(4.5, 10.0, 10.0 years). All of them entered puberty
spontaneously at the age of 10.9, 11.0 and 10.2 years
respectively. After the confirmation of their pubertal
onset with LHRH stimulation test, GnRH analogue
treatment was added. Auxological and pubertal
development were evaluated at 3-6 months intervals.
Bone age (BA) was also determined using the Greulich
and Pyle method. The special CDC TS-charts were
used.
Results: Just before staring GH treatment, the mean
height was 0.63±0.92 SDS whereas just before adding
GnRH analogue was 1.11±0.46 SDS (p=0.18)
( SDS:0.48). After a mean duration of 22.50±2.12
months of combined treatment the mean height was
2.11±0.85 SDS (p=0.10) ( SDS:1.00). BA was not
significantly advanced.
Conclusions: Combined treatment with GnRH analogue
and GH seems to improve height in girls with TS and SP
probably more rather than GH treatment alone. There
were only 3 patients and definite conclusions will arise
after the patients reach their final heights. However we
should always consider the economical and ethical cost
for such therapies.

Background and Aims: The baby friendly hospital
intiative is considered one of the most successful
international efforts ever performed to protect, promote
and support breast feeding. Objective of this study was
detrmine the level of implementation to each of ten steps
and to analyze the relationship between the
implementation for each of ten steps and selected
demographic characteristics.
Methods: A descriptive survey was conducted in
Khuramshahr (a city in Khuzestan, Southwestern of
Iran) in 2004. 376 women who attendies to health
centers for receiving health care were participated in this
study. They had done delivery in Valiasr hospital (baby
friendly hospital) during last year. An 27-
itemsquestionnaire was fulled by trained questioners.
Observation and questionnaire were instruments for data
collection .
- 316 -
Results: The average breast feeding initiation rate was
95.9% in the hospital three of ten steps were
implemented with a low adherence rate (steps: 6,7,10).
Three steps were implemented with a moderate
adherence rate (steps :3,4,5) The highest implementation
rate observed in step of 6 (95.9%) and the lowest rate
was related to implementation of step of 8 (66.5%). Two
way ANOVA revealed that women who had a Cesarean
Section experienced a significant difference in the
initiation and continue to breastfeeding (p<0.001).
Conclusions: The implantation of ten steps overall is
relatively good, but maternity services must increase
their efforts to consistently implement the ten steps, to
become more baby friendly and to more fully establish a
breast feeding culture within their institutions. Key
words: Baby friendly hospital, ten steps to successful
breastfeeding.

Background and Aims: The obesity epidemic is a
growing concern in the developing countries. The aim of
the study was to compare the somatometric parameters
of children living in urban/rural areas and Gypsy
children.
Methods: A total of 343 children were included in the
study; Group A: 208 city children, Group B: 99 children
from rural areas and Group C: 36 Gypsy children. The
age, sex, weight, height, and the body mass index (BMI)
were recorded.
Results: The mean (sd) of BMIs were; Group A:
BMI=19.44 (4.09), Group B: BMI=19.55 (3.55), Group
C: BMI=18.15 (2.6). No statistical differences were
reported among the 3 groups. BMI<18 and BMI>25 was
documented in 43% and 9.6% of city children, 40% and
7% of children from rural areas and 58% and 0% of
Gypsy children, respectively. Importantly, a positive
linear relationship was reported between BMI and age in
children from Group A (R2=0.218, p<0.001) and from
Group B (R2= 0.184, p<0.0001). Moreover, the
differences in BMI were more prominent in children
older than 10 years in Group A (p<0.001) and Group B
(p<0.001) Those differences were not seen in Gypsy
children.
Conclusions: There were no differences in BMI among
children living in urban, rural areas and Gypsy children.
About half of the children had BMI < 18. One out of 10
of city children were overweight. None of the Gypsy
children were overweight. The higher prevalence of
overweight was particularly large in older children.

Background and Aims: Bronchiectasis is a
morphological term used to describe abnormal
irreversibly dilated and often thick walled bronchi.
However, the precise relationship between the clinical
features, radiological, and histological findings in
children is unknown. Chest High Resolution Computed
Tomography, has greatly improved our ability to
recognise this condition and has now replaced
bronchography as the 'gold standard' imaging modality
for diagnosing bronchiectasis.
Methods: We present two boys, 6 and a 3 years old of
age, admitted to our department with lower lobe
consolidation and digital clubbing. Both children were
treated several times with antibiotics for radiologically
diagnosed pneumonias with the symptoms started before
their first year of life. They have also received treatment
for asthma on many occasions.
Results: In view of persistence of chest radiographic
abnormalities we performed a chest HRCT that revealed
bronchiectatic changes at the right middle lobe and
thickening of bronchial walls in the right and left lower
lobes in both children. The patients were investigated to
determine the aetiology of bronchiectasis, with
bronchoscopy, measurement of serum immunoglobulins
(Igs), IgG subclasses, specific antibody responses to
tetanus toxoid, and to the capsular polysaccharides of
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus
pneumoniae. Bacterial culture of bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL) fluid and Sweat tests were also performed. Both
patients received a 3 weeks course of oral antibiotics
and regular chest physiotherapy
Conclusions: Bronchiectasis should be suspected in
children with recurrent bronchitis or pneumonia, and
when despite appropriate therapy, pulmonary infiltrates
or atelectasis persist 12 weeks beyond the index illness.
NUTRITION AND PREVALENCE OF
CONSTIPATION IN LESS THAN 2 YEARS OF
INFANT

Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Alzahra
Hospital, Isfahan, Iran
Background and Aims: Constipation is one of the
common gastrointestinal problems in infant. This
research has been done in order to determine
constipation prevalence as well as the relationship
between the age and kind of nutrition with constipation
prevalence in infants
Methods: A cross-sectional study dine on 350 infants
aged 1-24 months referred to 3 teaching pediatric
climatic in Isfahan during 4 month in 2004. The bowel
habits less than two times per week or having hard and
dried stool is that meant by constipation. To compare
constipation prevalence and stool consistency in
different groups a Chi square test was used, and to
compare the frequency of bowel habit an ANOVA test
was used.
Results: 350 infants under the study showed the
constipation prevalence in different groups as follows:
- 317 -
76 breast - fed infants aged 1-6 months (5.2%
constipation), 44 formula - fed infants aged 1-6 months
(11.4% constipation), 19 both breast and formula - fed
infants aged 1-6 months (10.6% constipation), 119
breast infants aged 6-24 months (7.6% constipation), 58
formula - fed infants aged 6-24 months (19%
constipation), 34 both breast and formula - fed infants
aged 6-24 months (11.8% constipation).
Conclusions: Considering the obtained results for
different aged groups. It can be concluded that
constipation prevalence in formulae -fed infants in more
than breast fed infants. Constipation prevalence in two
groups doesn't show any significant difference. The
average frequency of bowel habit in breast - fed infants
is more than formula - fed.

Background and Aims: Obesity is growing problem
among children in developed countries as in transitional
countries as Croatia today. The cause of obesity is not
simple and there is more than one condition causing
final problem. The aim of this study is to found out how
cultural, geographical and religious habits, social status
and family life style influence the child obesity.
Methods: We investigated social and psychological
status and eating disorders in obese children in five
counties in Croatia (three in continental and two in
costal part of country). In five paediatric practice in
primary care, body mass index were calculated for
children from two to 16 years old, during one month
period. Children belonging above 85% (nearly 300)
were included in study. A questionnaire consisted of
several parts investigate social and psychological status
and eating disorders, including child's habits and activity
at home, kindergarten and school, and was filled up by
paediatrician and clinical psychologist with active
participation of parents.
Results: The results indicate importance and influence
of family life style and social and psychological identity
and nutrition in kindergarten and school on obesity
prevalence. The results will be of great importance for
guidelines for prevention of obesity among children and
education of parents, nursing, teachers and children
from early age to adolescence.
Conclusions: It is of great importance for obese
children to be aware of their physical appearance, their
status in families, schools or kindergartens and with
proper education try to pass over difficulties and to raise
the quality of future life.

Background and Aims: Two children with short
stature, triangular face, prominent forehead,
clinodactuly, subcutaneous fat tissue hypoplasia were
diagnosed as Russel-Silver syndrome. Normal
intelligence was assessed in both cases. Moderate
hemihypertrophy was noted in both children. In
addition, the girl had a 2 cm shorter leg.
Methods: The girl was born small for gestational age
(birth weight 1700 g and length 40 cm), while the boy
was a term born child with weight and height within
normal limits. The boys bone age (BA) was significantly
retarded (at age of 11 years, BA was 5), the girls BA
was 3 months at the age of two. The tests for pituitary
reserve were normal in both of them.
Results: Children's height at the beginning of the
growth hormone treatment was significantly lower for
age and sex (-3.5 SDS for the girl and -4 SDS for the
boy). The first year height gain for the boy was 13 cm,
and his final height is 158 centimeters after five years of
treatment. It is of note that the parents voluntarily
discontinued the GH treatment and that this is the
probably one of the reasons that he did not reach the
target height of 169 cm. The first year gain for the girl
was 10 cm. Initially well bellow the third percentile on
the growth chart she reached the 3rd percentille in the
course of treatment. She is still GH treated and is
growing on the third percentile.
Conclusions: Both children responded favorably on the
GH treatment.

Children’s Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Although hospitalized children
are at risk of malnutrition, routine nutritional screening
is impeded by lack of a simple nutritional screening
tool. The aim of the study was to assess the feasibility of
performing a nutritional risk screening instrument, and
to relate the nutritional risk score to anthropometric
parameters.
Methods: Cross-sectional pilot study at medium care
units of two pediatric hospitals, in all admitted children
aged > 14 days. Measurements of weight, length and
mid upper arm circumference were performed. The
screening instrument consisted of 6 items: (1) Subjective
clinical assessment (2) Underlying pathology
(3) Diarrhea, vomiting, loss of fluids or dysphagia
(4) Decreased food intake (5) Weight loss or poor
weight increase (6) Poor length growth.
Results: A total of 108 children were included (median
age of 5.1 years and median hospital stay 3 days). Items
- 318 -
1-5 of the screening instrument were successfully scored
in 87-100% of children, but item 6 could only be
answered in 64%. Total scores including items 1-5 were
obtained and nutritional risk was scored as none in 25%,
moderate in 57% and high in 18% of children. The
median SD-scores for anthropometric measurements
were significantly different between the risk groups,
with the high risk group having the lowest SD-scores.
Conclusions: Standard nutritional risk screening using a
simple questionnaire was possible in the majority of
children and the overall score was related to
anthropometric parameters. Awareness for malnutrition
can be increased by using a nutritional screening tool,
but further prospective investigation is needed.

Background and Aims: Our purpose was to investigate
the relationship between the risk factors for metabolic
syndrome and the plasma C-reactive protein (CRP)
concentration as measured by high-sensitive CRP assay
in children and adolescents.
Methods: We studied 74 children and adolescents. The
ages ranged from 6,5 to 17 years old. Body mass index,
triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
fasting glucose, insulin, systolic and diastolic blood
pressures, and CRP were measured. Blood pressure was
measured three times while seated and it was averaged
for analysis. The degree of insulin resistance was
determined with the use of homeostasis model
assessment (HOMA) and it was calculated as the
product of fasting plasma insulin level (mu/ml) and the
fasting plasma glucose level (mmoles/lt) divided by
22,5.
Results: There were statistically significant positive
correlations for CRP with body mass index (Spearman's,
r = 0,592, p<0,01), triglycerides (r =0,244, p<0,05),
diastolic blood pressure (r =0,351, p<0,01) and
homeostasis model assessment (r = 0,464, p< 0,01).
High-density lipoprotein cholesterol showed a
significant negative correlation with CRP (r = -0,366,
p<0,01). No correlation was found with systolic blood
pressure and with fasting glucose.
Conclusions: These results indicate that CRP, a marker
of inflammation that underlies atherosclerosis, is
associated with almost all metabolic syndrome risk
factors in children and adolescents.

Unit, Venizelio General Hospital, Heraklio, Crete,
Greece
Background and Aims: The metabolic syndrome in
adults is correlated with higher cardiovascular risk.
Recently, several studies discuss the presence of
metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents. Our
purpose was to calculate of the frequency of metabolic
syndrome in three groups of children and adolescents
according Body Mass Index (BMI). 1) BMI> 95th
percentile (obese), 2) 95th <BMI> 85th (overweight)
and 3) BMI <85th percentile.
Methods: We studied 106 obese, 30 overweight
children and 36 with BMI < 85th percentile who were
examined in the Pediatric Obesity Unit in our hospital.
The ages ranged from 6,5 to 17 years old. Blood
samples were received from all children after 12 hours
night fasting and glucose, triglycerides and HDL were
calculated. Blood pressure was also measured. The
children of our study were considered to have metabolic
syndrome if they completed 4 out of 5 of the following
criteria according age and sex: BMI > 85th percentile,
systolic pressure or/and diastolic pressure > 95th
percentile, triglycerides > 95th percentile, HDL < 5th
percentile and fasting glucose > 110 mg/dl.
Results: 11 out of 106 (10,36%) of the obese children
completed the criteria for metabolic syndrome. The
youngest child was a boy 6,5 years old. Only 2 out of
the 30 (6,6%) overweight children also completed the
necessary conditions for metabolic syndrome. In the
group with BMI <85th percentile there was not found
any child with metabolic syndrome.
Conclusions: The relatively high frequency of
metabolic syndrome in obese children should alert us in
maximizing our efforts towards prevention and
treatment of obesity.
PAEDIATRIC HYPONATRAEMIA: INCIDENCE,
AETIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
A M Mc Morrow, N P Corrigan
Department of Paediatric, Altnagelvin Area Hospital,
Londonderry, UK
Background and Aims: Recent publicity has
highlighted the potentially catastrophic results of
paediatric hyponatraemia. Little data exists however on
the overall incidence and course of uncomplicated
hyponatraemia in general paediatric practice.
Methods: All children admitted to Altnagelvin Hospital
over a 21-month period with hyponatraemia (<133)
were identified using our laboratory database. Newborns
and infants in NICU were excluded. Retrospective chart
review enabled data collection regarding incidence,
aetiology and management.
Results: 6,276 children were admitted to Altnagelvin
Hospital over the study period. 153 patients (2.4%) had
at least one documented episode of hyponatraemia
(medical 68% vs surgical 32%). Of 105 medical
children, the most common diagnoses were
gastroenteritis (25%), viral infections (25%) and lower
respiratory tract infection (21%). Of 21 general surgical
children, acute appendicitis accounted for 50%. The
- 319 -
incidence of hyponatraemia complicating acute
appendicitis was 11%. The primary pathophysiological
trigger for the hyponatraemia was attributable to SIADH
in 66% of children overall. Hyponatraemia was a
presenting feature in 88% of children. Intravenous fluid
therapy was prescribed for 61% of children. 0.45%
saline / dextrose (64%) and isotonic saline solutions
(27%) comprised the majority of prescribed fluids with
no children receiving solution 18. Fluid volumes were
given as maintenance in 60%, restricted in 31% and
potentially generous in 7%. No serious complications of
hyponatraemia were identified.
Conclusions: Hyponatraemia is a common complication
of acute illness in both medical and surgical children,
with SIADH as the primary mechanism. Very hypotonic
intravenous solutions are no longer being prescribed, in
keeping with regional guidelines.

Department of Children's Allergology, Gastroenterology
and Nutrition, Poland
Background and Aims: Enteral nutrition (EN) is a
preferable alimentation form for children with acute
pancreatitis (AP). The subject of the study was
evaluation EN tolerance in AP patients hospitalized in
Children's Allergology, Gastroenterology and Nutrition
Department of Medical University in ód , in
2005-2006.
Methods: Retrospective analysis involved the course of
EN: duration, amount of calories, change of body
weight and clinical tolerance of EN in 13 patients aged
from 4,5 to 18 years (average 10,6 ± 3,96), with 16
episodes observed. Low-fat, half-elementary diet was
applied by nasojejunal catheter, using pomp.
Results: 13 episodes AP were mild and 3 severe (2
pseudocysts and 1 rupture of pancreas, all treated by
drainage). AP etiology: abdominal trauma (n=4),
hereditary AP (n=1, 4 episodes), pancreas divisum
(n=1), cholelithiasis (n=1), infectious AP (n=2), post
valproic acid (n=1), idiopatic (n=3). EN time: 5 to 46
days (average 19±10,99); the shortest course -
hereditary AP (average 8±2,58), the longest - in
posttraumatic AP (average 28,5 ±12,28). By EN we
ensured the supply of 42,6±13,28 kcal/kg per day on
average, reaching rise of body weight 900±678,23 g
(2,68±2,02%) in 6 children; the initial weight -2 and
decrease - 8 patients (average 600±538,52g;
1,37±1,02%). Undesirable effects (nausea, diarrhoea,
vomitus) were observed in 6 patients (37%): 3 (19%) -
were passing, 3 (19%) - needed modification of
nutritional therapy (2 - lower dose of EN, 1 - TPN).
Conclusions: EN is well tolerated by children with mild
AP. The patients with posttraumatic AP, developing
complications, may cause worse EN tolerance.

Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Benha
University, Tukh, Kaliobia, Egypt
Background and Aims: Congenital chloride diarrhea
(CCD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder, is
characterized by sustained watery diarrhea (due to
defect of active Chloride/HCO3 exchange in ileum and
colon) with high fecal chloride. The estimated incidence
of CCD was 1 in 14000 in Kuwait reported in 1989.
Aim of our study was to spotlight the common
presentation of infants with CCD which appears not to
be an uncommon disorder in Kuwait for early
management and prevention of complications.
Methods: : Reviewing the inpatient database of
Pediatric Department of Al-Adan Hospital, Kuwait for
patients who were admitted as chronic diarrhea in the
first year of life, 12 patients were diagnosed as CCD.
The diagnosis of CCD was based on antenatal and early
infantile presentation and confirmed by laboratory
finding of excess chloride loss in stool and low serum
chloride level.
Results: All 12 patients were born to consanguineous
parents, had antenatal history of IUGR, polyhydramnios
and distended hypoechoic fetal bowel and presented
with abdominal distension, hypotonia and muscle
wasting. Whereas, 10 patients (90%) were delivered
prematurely, and 9 patients (75%) had absence of
normal meconium at birth. Our patients showed
significant decrease in serum sodium, potassium,
chloride and urine chloride compared with the average
for age and had significant increase in serum
bicarbonates, plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone
and stool chloride.
Conclusions: High index of suspicious and awareness
should be considered for early diagnosis of CCD in this
population especially in the presence of consanguineous
marriage and the characteristic features in antenatal
ultrasound for early investigations and appropriate
management.
OUT OF HOSPITAL CARDIAC ARREST IN A
PEDIATRIC POPULATION: AN
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
G van Berlaer, V Van Gorp, S Hachimi-Idrissi
Department of Pediatric Critical Care, Academical
Hospital of the 'Vrije Universiteit Brussel', Brussels,
Belgium
Background and Aims: Resuscitation for pre-hospital
cardio-pulmonary arrest (PCPA) in children has a very
poor outcome. We believe that training Emergency
Medical Service personnel in pediatric life support skills
improves survival rate and neurological outcome. Our
aim is to describe a large pediatric population who
developed PCPA, and to outline the influence of pre-
cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPCR) factors
on survival rate.
Methods: From 1991 till 2005, clinical records of all
patients younger than 16 years with PCPA were
reviewed. All data were prospectively registered using a
uniform standard registry, and adjusted to the Utstein
style report. The studied pre-CPCR factors were
- 320 -
restricted to age, site and cause of PCPA, bystander
CPCR (lay or skilled), time to intubation and
administration of drugs, initial cardiac rhythm and
respiratory pattern on arrival of the mobile intensive
care unit team.
Results: Out of all data of registered pediatric patients
with PCPA, we present their median age, sites and
causes of PCPA, the number of dead on arrival, the
number of attempted CPCR and achievement of
restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). We
compare the influence of different initial cardiac
rhythms and respiratory patterns on the percentage of
ROSC and regaining of consciousness. We also
compare results of CPCR performed by lay bystanders
or by EMS-personnel as a witness, skilled in pediatric
life support, on survival rate and neurological outcome.
Conclusions: Rapid intervention and resuscitation by
EMS-bystanders skilled in pediatric life support
increases survival rate and neurological outcome in
children. For this reason CPCR training, appropriate
equipment and rapid intervention are mandatory.

Background and Aims: Head to tail fusion of ABL
protooncogene from chromosome 9 to breakpoint
cluster region (BCR) on chromosome 22 generates a
hybrid BCR/ABL gene. This hybrid is found in adult
and in childhood myelogenous leucemia. In addition, the
same fusion is found in 2-10% of childhood
lymphoblastic leucemias. Since this BCR/ABL fusion is
an ominous prognostic factor (conferring drug
resistance) its early determination is important for the
choice of the intensity of the treatment protocol.
Methods: We analyzed 52 children with acute
leucaemias for the BCR/ABL fusion. DNA was isolated
and RTPCR was performed with specific primers.
Results: Among 42 children with acute lymphoblastic
leucaemias and 6 children with acute myeloic leucemia
no BCR/ABL fusion was found. One out of four
children with chronic myelogenous leucemia was
BCR/ABL positive (25%). Hyperleucocitosis and skin
haemathomas were initial signs. Cytological and
cytochemical analysis confirmed a chronic myelogenous
leucemia. A chemotherapy was started and bone marrow
transplantation was performed.
Conclusions: Further monitoring of the patient for
BCR-ABL fusion is in progress.
CLINICAL COURSE AND TREATMENT

DERMATITIS
N Kavlashvili, M Kherkheulidze, N Adamia
State Medical University, Tbilisi, Georgia
Background and Aims: Recently prevalence of allergic
disorders and among them atopic dermatitis is quite high
(10-20% according data of different countries) and have
increasing tendency. So, atopic dermatitis remains one
of the serious problems of pediatricians. The aim of our
study was to assess clinical course of atopic dermatitis
in children using SCORAD index.
Methods: We studied 32 patients aged 1-6 year, who
admitted to M. Guramishvili Pediatric clinic in
2005-2006 year. All patients fulfilled the criteria of
Hannifin and Rajka at least 3 major and 3 minor criteria
for diagnosis of atopic dermatitis. The SCORAD index
was used to evaluate severity of disease. Were assessed
objective signs - spread of lesions, intensity (erythema,
edema, oozing, excoriation, lichenification, xerosis) and
subjective signs (pruritus and sleeping disorders).
Results: The mean SCORAD index before treatment
was 45,9. Treatment was conducted by Advantan
(Methylprednisolole aceponate - 0,15) – corticosteroid
for topical use. Advantan was used once a day on
damaged skin. On third-forth days of treatment was
founded improvement of clinical (SCORAD index
decreases) and subjective signs. After 7 days of
treatment in 70% of patients and after 10 days in rest
30% was observed clinical remission of disease (The
mean SCORAD index after treatment was 5.6).
Conclusions: So, we can conclude that SCORAD index
is effective and easy method for evaluation of treatment
efficacy and clinical course of atopic dermatitis in
children.
TUBULAR AND GLOMRULAR FUNCTION IN
MAJOR TALASSEMIA
S Sadeghi Bojd
Department of Pediatrics, Zahedan Medical Sciences,
Zahedan, Iran
Background and Aims: Thalassemia is a heterogenous
groups of disease and are the most common genetic
disorder on a worldwide basin. The severity correlated
with the degree of anemia, hyper transfusion and iron
chelating therapy This study is designed to define renal
tubular and glumerolar abnormalities with beta
thalassemia and to correlate the renal finding with
clinical parameters.
Methods: One hundred sixty six patients (mean age
13.34), mean weight (31.78) were studied. The patients
were 96 male (57.8%) and 70 female (42.8%). 24 hours
urine secretion was collected and was examined for
level of Na, K, Creatinin, Mg, Uric acid, Beta 2
Microglobulin, Protein, Ca and Phospharose.
Results: 78.3% of patients had normal GFR and 21.7%
had abnormal GFR. The mean of tubular parameters
such as protein, phospharose, Uric acid, Na, Beta 2
Microglobulin, were higher than normal level.
Significantly higher levels of Uric acid, P, Na, Beta 2
MG, were found compared with normal level.
Conclusions: Correlation was not found between serum
ferritin and urine parameters.(p<0.01). We do not know
that the degree of renal dysfunction correlated to
response to therapy (Iron chelation), frequent
transfusion and/or splenectomy, or not? Further study in
particular long term follow up in thalassemic patients
- 321 -
after efficient iron chelation and hypertransfusion is
needed to clarify our observation.

Background and Aims: Paroxysmal Cold
Hemoglobinuria (PCH) is characterised by a sudden
onset of hemoglobinuria either spontaneously or after
exposure to cold. The authors illustrate some of the
difficulties in making the diagnosis of this very rare
condition in childhood and discuss the benefits of early
communication between the on call Paediatrician and
Haematologist.
Methods: We report on the clinical and laboratory
findings of a 3 years old boy who presented with coryzal
symptoms, cough, fever and 'blackcurrant juice'
coloured urine which was initially thought to be
haematuria. Two weeks prior to this episode he has had
chicken pox. Examination showed pallor, congested
tonsils, suprapubic tenderness, ankle oedema and
periorbital swelling.
Results: Blood investigations showed haemoglobin
6.4gr/dL, normal U/E's and LFT's but haemolysed
potassium and bilirubin. Urinalysis showed 3+ of blood
and red cell casts but no red cells. Direct Coombs and
Donath-Landsteiner Tests were positive. The patient
received blood transfusion due to drop of his Hb to 5.3
gr/dL and deterioration of some of his vital signs.
Conclusions: PCH pose a challenge for Paediatricians
as it is very rare disease and mimics other conditions. It
should be considered in every patient with sudden drop
in hemoglobin and hemoglobinuria.
HENOCH-SCHONLEIN PURPURA. OUR
EXPERIENCES
V P Zlatkovska
Department of Pediatrics, Opsta Bolnica, Stip,
Macedonia
Background and Aims: HSP is generally
hypersensitive vasculitis on smaller blood vessels, with
unknown ethyopathogenesis. Children are most
common susceptible group. It is characterized by triad
of symptoms: on the skin, joints and gastrointestinal
track. Renal involvement is also frequent, while CNS,
testicals and lungs are less frequent attacked. To present
experience with children treated for HSP in our
institution. Treatment, analysis and monitoring.
Methods: A retrospective study on 4 patients treated on
HSP in 2003-2005. All four of them were children.
Three girls and one boy, with average age of 5 years,
corresponding to literature.
Results: On girls, signs typical for HSP were
developed. On male patient the first signs developed on
testicals. At the latter phase, the rash developed on
typical locations. Arthromialgies were present on all of
the patients. GIT symptoms were identified through
colicky and vomiting. Kidney disorder developed on
one of the patient, accompanied with long term rash,
hematuria and proteinuria. Peak of the disease lasted for
2 weeks. One of the patients recurred, with equal
severity of the disease (rash, gastrointestinal pain and
HS nephrite). The treatment was untypical: rest, anti-
inflammatory drugs, vitamins, and in cases of infection
therapy with antibiotics was applied. In cases of severe
abdominal pain and kidney involvement, corticosteroids
were applied as well. Soon after their admission, disease
signs disappeared.
Conclusions: HSP has a self-limiting condition, but
needs close follow-up of the patients. If there is no
kidney disorder, as a result to HSP, generally this
disease has excellent prognosis.
SEVERE CHILDHOOD DERMATOMYOSITIS
COMPLICATED WITH PANCREATITIS
E G Martinez Iriart, D Bottaro, A Pizzo, G Ortellao,

Department of Medicine, Children Hospital 'Dr Ricardo
Gutierrez', Buenos Aires, Argentina
Background and Aims: Dermatomyositis (DM) is an
idiopathic rheumatologic disease with characteristic
cutaneous and muscular findings. DM is a systemic
disorder that frequently affects the joints, esophagus,
lungs, and less commonly, the heart. Pancreatitis and
hepatitis are extremely rare and are associated to severe
forms of the disease.
Methods: We report a 3-years-old male, previously
healthy, who developed malar rash, cutaneous ulcers on
axillary area, generalized lymphadenopathy,
poliarthritis, hepatomegaly, poliarthritis, myalgias and
muscular weakness. Laboratory: Anemia. Functional
hepatic and muscular laboratory: Elevated levels of
serum hepatic enzymes, aldolasa, CPK and LDH. FAN,
ANA, ASMA, JO1, LCM, MI2: Negative. Virals and
parasitic serology: Negatives. PPD: Negative. IgG, IgM,
IgA, C4 elevated. C3: Normal electromyography:
Inflammatory myopathy. Deglutition tests: Oronasal
reflux with active disease who develops abdominal pain.
Ocular fundus examination: Normal. Diagnostic of
severe form of DM was done and successive treatments
with intravenous gammaglobulin, corticosteroids,
methothrexate and cyclophosphamide were carried out.
During the clinical course he developed pancreatitis. It
required intensive care. The patient improved and he re-
initiated primary DM treatment.
Results: Pancreatitis, if it appears, demands us to
diagnose infectious and toxic (drug-induced) etiology.
Hepatitis and pancreatitis, excluded infectious and toxic
etiology, must be considered as several forms of DM.
We wish to alert physicians that pancreatitis may
develop in childhood dermatomyositis. It should be
considered as a differential diagnosis in the child
findings.
Conclusions: Hepatitis and pancreatitis, although rare,
are reported in pediatric patients and must be consider a
severe form of the disease and requires intensive and
aggressive treatments.

Department of Medicine, Children Hospital 'Dr Ricardo
Gutierrez', Buenos Aires, Argentina
Background and Aims: Systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE) is an autoimmune disease that causes
disseminated tisular inflammation. Hydroxyclhoroquine
is an effective antilupus drug with phototoxic side
effects.
Methods: We report a case of juvenile SLE with
photosensivity associated to hydroxycloroquine. We
present a female adolescent who developed in the last
year neumonitis, poliserositis, miocarditis, malar
erythema, arterial hypertension and pancytopaenia.
Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-DNA antibodies
were positives. She was treated with corticosteroids and
hydroxycloroquine.12 months later, she presented
progressive photosensivity leading to generalizated
erythrodermia. Treatment with local and oral
hydrocortisone and antibiotics was unsuccessful. Skin
biopsy revealed Interphase dermatitis. Suspecting drug
sensivity hydroxycloroquine was interrupted and the
patient improved.
Results: Hydroxycloroquin has effective response in the
treatment of SLE with muscular and skin involvement.
But hydroxycloroquine photosensitivity also occurred.
Physicians must consider it as differential diagnosis of
re-activated SLE.
Conclusions: 1) Differential diagnoses of a patient with
active SLE and photosensivity is often difficult. 2) Skin
biopsy can be used to diagnose this entity 3) We must
consider hydroxycloroquin photosensivity in a patient
with poor response to standard therapy.

Background and Aims: Thalasemia major - a problem
in the Strumica region, Republic of Macedonia, in the
1990-2003 period. Thalasemia, also known as
Mediterranean anaemia, are quantitative disorders in the
normal globulin chain synthesis, building blocks of
haemoglobin. The thalasemia is encountered around the
Mediterranean, which is also the region the city of
Strumica and its county belongs to.
Methods: A review of clinical histories of patients
treated of the aforementioned disease at the hospital in
Strumica during 1990-2003.
Results: In this period we had 6 children aged 6-18
years. All but one (the oldest) underwent splenectomy,
and afterwards received a supstitution of washed
Eryhtrocytes once a month, as well as Desferal
parenterally. Each child was hospitalized ten times a
year. Out of total number of hospitalizations, in this
period, these patients account for 40 days. Genetic
examination performed in 4 children (oldest in their
families). Thanks to the preventive pregnancy screening,
only one additional case was included in year 1997. The
oldest patient treated from Thalasemia major, passed
away in January 2004, at the age of 18; the diagnosis
was Myocardiopathia chronica decompensate.
Conclusions: Thalasemia major is a real problem in our
region and we must always think about this disease.
ERYTHEMA NODOSUM – CASE REPORT OF
FOUR DIFFERENT ETIOLOGIES
C Dâmaso, P Ferreira, C Constantino, A Casimiro,
F Cunha
Serviço de Pediatria, Hospital Reynaldo dos Santos,
Vila Franca de Xira, Portugal
Background and Aims: Erythema nodosum (EN) is an
acute, nodular, erythematous eruption, usually limited to
the extensor aspects of lower legs. EN is presumed to be
a hypersensitivity reaction and may occur in association
with several systemic diseases, drug therapies and may
be idiopathic. The authors describe the clinical
presentation, investigation pathways, clinical course and
treatment outcomes of four patients with EN.
Methods: Review of four patient's files followed in our
Paediatric Department.
Results: Four patients with EN clinical diagnosis were
studied (1 boy-3 girls), aged 7 -12 years, who had a 2
year follow-up after initial diagnosis. Two patients
required admission to the hospital and two were
followed exclusively in the outpatient clinic. All started
with the typical clinical picture, with fever and painful,
red nodules on the legs. None had history of drug use,
known exposure to tuberculosis or diarrhea. Blood tests
showed increased acute reactants; Tuberculin Skin Test
(Mantoux) was negative as were product cultures. Upon
extensive investigation based on this same clinical
presentation, the etiology of three cases was determined:
case 1 - post- Streptococcal pharyngitis; case 2 -
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); case 3 - acute
Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. In the fourth case,
after exhaustion of investigation pathways, an idiopathic
EN was assumed. Treatment directed to the underlying
etiology was ensued and all four cases had a good
clinical outcome.
Conclusions: EN is a hypersensitivity reaction with
many etiologies. Although usually a self limited
condition, it can be the first manifestation of an
underlying chronic disease.

Background and Aims: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)
in the newborn is an uncommon presenting
manifestation of hemophilia, occurring with an
incidence of 1-4%, however, it has dramatic
consequences. Apart from its high mortality rate, over
50% of survivors are left with psychoneurological
sequelae, especially seizures and motor impairment.
Methods: A male full-term infant with birth weight of 4
kg was born into a family without history of hemophilia.
He was born with vaginal delivery, soon after birth, the
child became irritable and difficult to feed. He was
found to be hypoactive with full anterior fontanelle and
cyanosis, the patient’s head circumference (HC) was 37
cm, heart rate was 170/min, respiratory rate was 66/min,
and BP was 90/60 mm Hg. He was immediately
transferred to NICU for close observation, but he
deteriorated and became semiconscious, with shallow
breathing.
Results: Arterial blood gas analysis showed respiratory
acidosis that was managed with assisted ventilation.
ICH was highly suspected and confirmed by CT scan of
the head. The patient was screened for hemophilia on
the second day after birth. PTT was raised (120 seconds,
control 34 seconds) and factor VIII was 1 u/ml.
Conclusions: Appropriate doses of cryoprecipitate were
infused every 12 hours to raise factor VIII level to more
than 50 units/ml. Infusion of cryoprecipitate was
continued for 16 days. A few days later, the patient
regained consciousness, was crying for feeds and
suckling well, and was moving all the limbs, though
with slight increase in the tone. He was, extubated from
the ventilator.
REVERSIBLE MODERATE THROMBOPENIA IN
A 11 YEAR OLD CHILD TREATED WITH
VALPROATE
N Boutrid, H Rahmoune, H Allas
Mansourah Pediatric Hospital, Constantine, Algeria
Background and Aims: It is well known that therapy
with valproate may induce a thrombocytopenia. In this
case report, a 11-year-old child having symptomatic
epilepsy - Petit Mal - was under Valproate since age 8
years.
Methods: Regular controls of liver enzymes and blood
counts were ruled, and a thrombopenia was discovered,
without any clinical feature, after the girl received
Valproate (750 mg/day) for 2 years. Blood count
showed moderate thrombocytopenia of 89 GIGA/L
(normal: 150-450 GIGA/L), with normal coagulation
parameters.
Results: Simple survey, with weekly clinical controls
and periodic platelet counts, noted spontaneous
remission, and the thrombocyte count normalized within
4 months.
Conclusions: No screening methods preview presence
of a severe or fatal Valproate therapy complication.
Therefore clinical and biological controls are indicated
for patients under valproate.

OF 36 CHILDREN WITH FANCONI ANEMIA
S Ansari, N Ahanchi, T Sadedel, M Hashemi
Department of Hematology, Iran University, Ali Asghar
Children's Hospital, Tehran, Iran
Background and Aims: Fanconi anemia is the most
form of inherited aplastic anemia and characterized by
progressive bone marrow failure, congenital anomalies
and cancer susceptibility. Common anomalies are
skeletal abnormalities, skin pigmentation disorder, short
stature, head abnormalities, kidney and gonad disorders
respectively. Complication of fanconi anemia including
leukemia, liver tumors in 5% and other cancers occurs
in 5% of them. In this study, in addition of clinical and
radiologic investigation of children with fanconi anemia,
survival, prognostic factors and complication of disease
were also determined.
Methods: This retrospective analytic cross-sectional
study was carried out on 36 patients with fanconi
anemia who were diagnosed in Ali Asghar Children’s
Hospital from 1985-2002. Data was analyzed by Spss
software.
Results: Skeletal abnormalities was most common
congenital anomalies and other anomalies were skin
pigmentation disorder, short stature, kidney disorder,
microcephaly and male genital disorder respectively. 5
and 10 years survival rates of fanconi anemia patients
were 80%, 71% respectively. In bivariate analysis, the
age at diagnosis correlated with survival rate
significantly (p=0.006) and patients with age less than
10 years at diagnosis had more survival rate than others.
In our study, prevalence of kidney disorder as a
congenital anomalies is more than other investigation
and in contrast, frequency of short stature,
microcephaly, skin pigmentation and male genitalia
disorder are less than others.
Conclusions: Complication of fanconi anemia including
leukemia, because of defective DNA repair in
approximately 10% of patients, liver tumors in 5%. One
of considerable result of this research is absence of
neoplastic.

Background and Aims: Hoenoch Schonlein vasculitis
may present with very atypical features, particularly in
very young infants. In this work we present a 3 year old
female who initially presented with very unusual
localization of angioedema in lumbar region.
Methods: A descriptive case, standard clinical
laboratory and serologic investigations.
Results: A three year old female presented with pains in
ankles and knees. The joints were swollen and tender.
There was a sudden appearance of a soft tissue
formation in the lumbar region. Laboratory revealed
increased ASTO titer (600 U/l) suggesting diagnosis of
rheumatic fever. The treatment with oral penicillin V
was started. The throat swab was negative. Two days
latter a purpuric rash developed over lower extremities,
characteristic for Hoenoch Schonelin purpura. Analysis
of the urine did not reveal renal affection. There were no
abdominal symptoms. Angioedema in the lumbar region
resolved spontaneously.
Conclusions: This young female presented very
atypical features of Hoenoch Schonlein vasculitis:
arthritis preceding appearance of purpura, mimicking
rheumatic fever. Although angioedema may be seen in
Hoenoch Schonlein patients, lumbar localization is very
unusual.

Background and Aims: Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA)
in children is common nutritional problem all over the
world. The aim of our study was to investigate the
prevalence and associated background factors of iron
deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) in
infants aged 9 to 12 months in Estonia.
Methods: Every second child aged 9–12 months was
randomly selected from primary medical centres in 7
counties from all over Estonia. A questionnaire
concerning eating habits and lifestyle was sent to their
parents. Thirty six percent (n=195) of contacted families
agreed to participate in the study. Haemoglobin (Hb),
mean corpuscular volume (MCV), serum ferritin,
soluble transferrin receptors (TfR) and C-reactive
protein (CRP) were measured in 171 infants. Anaemia
was defined as Hb < 105 g/l, and iron deficiency (ID) as
ferritin < 12 μg/L and MCV < 74 fl.
Results: The prevalence of ID was 14.0% and IDA
9.4%. Birthweight (BW) less than 3000 g was the main
associated background factor for ID (OR=9.4;
p<0.0005). Infants fed with breast-milk and solid food
had lower ferritin concentration than infants fed with
formula and solid food [18.5 μg/L (95% CI 14.0-23.0)
vs. 32.8 μg/L (26.6-39) (p<0.005)].
Conclusions: IDA was common in infants aged 9-12
months in Estonia. The main associated background
factor for ID was BW less than 3000 g.

Background and Aims: Maternal immunization may
protect young infants by provision of passive immunity.
Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PSV) has been
shown to elicit protective levels of antibodies in normal
pregnant women and their infants. We evaluated
immunogenicity of PSV vaccine in HIV-infected
(HIV+) pregnant women and the antibody kinetics from
birth to 6 months of age.
Methods: Serotype-specific antibodies to 6 capsular
pneumococcal polysaccharides (CPs) (1, 3, 5, 6B, 9V
and 14) were quantified before PSV immunization
(gestational age of 32-34 wks) and at delivery in 44
(HIV+) pregnant women and in their infants at birth, 1,
2, 3 and 6 months. All mothers had prevaccination
(PRV) CD4+ counts > 200/mm3, 97.7% were
asymptomatic, and 97.8% received antiretroviral
prophylaxis. Anti-CPs antibodies were measured with
an ELISA.
Results: Overall, PRV antibodies > 1.3 ug/ml were
found in 48 to 82% of the women. Significant increases
in postvaccination antibody concentrations were found
for all serotypes except CP 3. At delivery, higher
antibody levels were detected in mothers (1.3-9.2 ug/ml)
than in neonates (0.7-4.4 ug/ml). Placental transfer
ratios (newborn/mother) ranged from 47-59%.
Protective levels of antibodies were estimated for CPs 5,
6B, 9V and 14 in neonates, and for CPs 5, 6B and 14 in
1 month infants. Except for S14, lower than protective
levels were estimated for 5/6 serotypes in infants >=2
months.
Conclusions: Although (HIV+) mothers respond to
most CPs present in PSV, maternal vaccination is not
adequate to maintain protective levels of anti-CPs
antibodies in infants due to the limitations of placental
transport. Funded by FAPESP, Brazil.
DOPPLER ASSESSMENT OF THE MIDDLE
CEREBRAL ARTERIES BY TWO DIFFERENT
APPROACHES
S J Moltu, E Schumacher, T Stiris
Division of Neonatology, Ullevaal University Hospital,
Oslo, Norway
Background and Aims: Cerebral ultrasound is a well
established method to assess brain integrity in the
preterm infant. The major cerebral lesions in these
- 325 -
infants are of circulatory origin and pulsed and color
Doppler evaluation has become an important tool for
studying cerebral hemodynamics. To aim for minimal
handling of the premature infants, we wanted to
investigate whether measuring blood flow velocity
toward or away from the transducer probe gave equal
blood flow velocity (BFV) estimates within the same
vessel, thus enabling us to measure both middle cerebral
arteries (MCA’s) from one side only.
Methods: Using an 8.5 Hz probe BFV was measured in
the right and left MCA by placing the probe over the
respective temporal template. In addition to the flow
estimates of the ipsilateral vessel, we also obtained the
negative BFV estimate of the contra lateral vessel (flow
away from the probe). The same procedure was repeated
from the opposite side and ultimately the two separate
estimates were compared. The order of left and right
was chosen randomly.
Results: The intraclass correlation coefficient was used
for comparison between the two methods of
measurements. There was a strong concordance between
the flow velocity estimates with an Inter-Item
Correlation matrix of 0.831.
Conclusions: Our results depicts that measuring blood
flow velocity toward or away from the transducer probe
gives equal estimates, hence allowing measurements of
the right and left MCA from just one side, and thereby
avoiding having to turn the head from one side to
another in the often unstable premature infant.

Background and Aims: To evaluate immunological
secretory memory, we studied production of s-IgA
specific for E. coli (Anti-Ec-s-IgA) in mothers' milk of
different ethnia previously exposed to poor conditions,
but living in Italy in adequate conditions. Moreover, we
explored cytokines levels (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10). 112
colostrums samples were included into the study: 24
from European Eastern Countries (EEC), 24 from Asia,
24 from Africa, 40 from Italy.
Methods: Anti-Ec-s-IgA and cytokines were quantified
by ELISA technique. Statistic analysis was performed
with respect to Italians. Univariate analysis was
performed for Anti-Ec- s-IgA and cytokines. Multiple
Regression was performed when residence period, home
returns and cytokines concentration were considered
explication variables (EV).
Results: Foreign milk presented higher levels of Anti-
Ec-s-IgA than Italians, for Asian women the difference
was significant (p=0.007). Asian and African's milk
(p=0.031, p=0.015) reported significant higher
concentration when data were corrected for EV. A
positive correlation between Anti-Ec-s-IgA and IL-8
was always observed (p=0.01). Milk from EEC revealed
the highest IL-8 levels (p=0.026). Milk from Asians
presented IL-6 greatest concentration (p=0.004).
Africans reported IL-10 littlest concentration (p=0.046).
Conclusions: High levels of Anti-Ec-s-IgA in foreign
milk may due to mothers' previous exposition. Since all
mothers in Italy were in adequate conditions, this could
be the expression of a secretory immunologic memory.
The highest amounts of IL-8 in EEC milk and of IL-6 in
Asian milk may promote defense mechanisms useful
where infections are severe. Opposite IL-10, a down-
regulator of pro-inflammatory cytokine, is less useful in
those countries where stimulatory mediators are
required to defeat environmental infections.
RIGHT ILIAC FOSSA GROANS - REMEMBER
WORMS!

Department of Surgery, William Harvey Hospital,
Ashford, UK
Background and Aims: Enterobius vermicularis
(pinworm) infestation is a recognized but often forgotten
cause of acute right iliac fossa pain especially in
children. It is a ubiquitous parasite of man transmitted
faeco-orally that resides primarily in the caecum. The
aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and
clinico-pathological findings in children undergoing
appendicectomy.
Methods: A retrospective review of all
appendicectomies in patients below the age of 21
between January 2004 and July 2005. Data on clinical
presentation and pathological findings were recorded.
Results: Of a total of 369 appendicectomies, 18 (4.9%)
had Enterobius vermicularis on histology. There were
12 females and 6 males with a mean age of 13 years.
Their mean duration of symptoms was 2.4 days,
temperature 37.1o C and WBC 8.7 X 109/L. There was
no histological evidence of acute inflammation in 16
appendices and in the remaining 2 the inflammation was
graded as only very mild.
Conclusions: Enterobius vermicularis is a significant
cause of right iliac fossa pain in children and should be
considered in the differential diagnosis of acute
appendicitis. It is not associated with acute
inflammatory changes in the appendix.
LEMIERRE'S SYNDROME WITH BENIGN
PROGNOSIS: A CASE REPORT
R Fernandes, J Caiado, F Prata, A Mouzinho,
P Valente
Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Paediatrics,
Santa Maria's Hospital, Lisbon, Portugal
Background and Aims: Lemierre’s syndrome is a rare
form of septicaemia caused by the anaerobic gram-
negative bacterium Fusobacterium Necrophorum. The
characteristic clinical picture follows oropharyngeal
infections and includes septic thrombophlebitis of the
internal jugular vein. It may be complicated by
multisystem septic embolism and a high mortality, but
less severe cases have also been described. The aim of
- 326 -
this report is to stress the need for a high index of
suspicion to prompt diagnosis, and to discuss current
therapeutic options.
Methods: Case-report.
Results: We present a case of a previously healthy
eleven-year old girl with a transient episode of mild sore
throat followed a week later by fever, a prominent
cervical abscess and elevated laboratory inflammatory
markers. Early surgical debridement was performed and
the patient received amoxicillin-clavulanate with
metronidazol for eight days and improved considerably.
Fusobacterium Necrophorum was isolated from the
drained purulent material and a right vein jugular vein
thrombosis was confirmed by neck ultrasonography.
The antibiotic therapy was maintained for three weeks
with clindamycin, along with short-duration (two
weeks) anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin. No
systemic complications were identified and there were
no sequelae at follow-up.
Conclusions: The benign nature of this case, after
adequate management, highlights the role of both
imaging and microbiology techniques in diagnosis.
Appropriate therapy includes adequate antibiotic
treatment and early surgical intervention, if required.
The role of anticoagulation remains controversial.

Background and Aims: In clinical practice in
neutropenic fever patients with no microbiologically and
clinically defined infection, the decision for the
clinicians when to stop antibiotic therapy or the risk of
underestimating an occult infection is the main problem.
A reliable highly specific and sensitive marker which
could be helpful in early prediction of infection in
neutropenic fever is needed in the era of antibiotic
resistance.
Methods: We have evaluated the diagnostic value of
Procalcitonin (PCT) compared with C-reactive protein
(CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in
predicting the infection in neutropenic fever patients and
durational change for 48 (at 0,8,24,48 hour) hours of
these parameters in the presence of defined infection in
60 febrile episodes of 49 patients.
Results: PCT and CRP levels were significantly higher
in neutropenic fever patients than afebrile cancer
patients (p<0.001) throughout the study period, but ESR
levels did not show any significant difference (p>0.05).
In sequential analysis of the patients without
documented infections, the median of PCT
concentrations show tendency to fall after the 8th hour
of onset of fever, while in patients with documented
infection those normalized after the 48th hour.
Sequential analysis of median PCT levels were found to
decrease in 48 hours period in patients with fever lasting
in 72 hours while in patients with prolonged fever PCT
sustained its level in overall period.
Conclusions: In conclusion, our study suggests PCT
when measured periodically is more useful diagnostic
inflammatory parameter in pediatric neutropenic fever
patients than CRP in both estimating the duration and
origin of fever and deciding the antimicrobial choice.

Amadora, Portugal
Background and Aims: Bacterial meningitis is a
serious infection in pediatric age, associated with high
risk of complications and sequelae. Objective: To
characterize the etiology and evolution of bacterial
meningitis and evaluate risk factors associated with poor
prognosis.
Methods: Retrospective study, between July 1996 and
December 2005, of all children admitted with bacterial
meningitis. Analysed demographic, clinical, laboratory
and evolution data. SPSS 13.0 for Windows was used
for statistical analysis.
Results: Total of 107 cases were observed; 49,5% less
than 2 years old and 43,4% had chronic disease. All
children were immunized against Haemophilus
influenzae, 4,1% had pneumococcal vaccine and 3,1%
meningocococal C vaccine. Ethiologic diagnosis made
in 65 (60,7%) cases; Neisseria meningitidis (32),
Streptococus pneumoniae (22), Haemophilus influenzae
(3), Streptococcus agalactae (4) and others (5).
Complications occurred in 25% cases: seizures (14),
coma (8), cranial nerve paralysis (6), cerebral stroke (6),
motor disabilities (4), hydrocephalus (4) and others (11).
Sequelae occurred in 14% cases: hearing loss (8),
mental disabilities (7), motor disabilities (5), epilepsy
(5) and others (5). One child died. complications were
associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae
(58,3%vs15,9%, p=0,006, Exp(B) 21,472), CSF
glucose<30mg/dL (68,2%vs28,6%, p=0,011, Exp(B)
8,900) and sepsis (44,4%vs20,3%; p=0,014, Exp(B)
10,813). Risk factors for sequelae where Streptococcus
pneumoniae (69,2 vs21,8%, p=0,009, Exp(B) 11,127)
and CSF glucose <30mg/dL (83,3%vs31%, p=0,047,
Exp(B)10,468).
Conclusions: Bacterial meningitis is an important cause
of morbility in pediatric age. Specific immunizations
and other intervention strategies can modified in the
future the epidemiology of this disease.

Background and Aims: The correct use of antibiotics
is the most effective way to prevent bacterial resistance.
- 327 -
The knowledge and control of its prescription should be
a constant concern of the Hospital's Committee for
Infection Control. Hospital Dona Estefania is a referral
paediatric hospital with a high risk maternity with
obstetrical clinics. Our aim was to quantify the
expenditure on intravenous antibiotics in a tertiary
paediatric hospital with obstetrical clinics.
Methods: The source of data were the Pharmacy's and
the Institute for Informatics and Financial Management
files. For each intravenous antibiotic the expenditure in
g, costs in Euros and per g were evaluated for the years
of 2003-2004.
Results: Penicillin's were the main group of antibiotics
prescribed (43% of the total of prescriptions, 32% of the
total of expenditure) followed by the group of second
generation cephalosporins (20%; 27%),
aminoglycosides (13%; 3%) and third generation
cephalosporins (9%; 16%). Amongst penicillin's the
most prescribed were benzylpenicillins, ampicillin and
amoxycillin/clavulanic acid while amongst first and
second generation cephalosporins it was cefoxitin
(70%). Cefazolin, the antibiotic advised for surgical
prophylaxis, accounted for 9%. Amongst
aminoglycosides, gentamicin was the most frequently
used (90%) while for third generation cephalosporins it
was ceftriaxone, followed by cefotaxime and
ceftazidime The expenditure with intravenous
antibiotics accounted for 62% of the total expenses with
antibiotics, 32% with anti infectious agents and 6.1%of
the total therapeutic charge.
Conclusions: Intravenous antibiotics use in Dona
Estefania hospital seems very reasonable. Prescriptions
follow ancient teachings with preference for old
antibiotics but surgical prophylaxis has to be improved.

Background and Aims: Parainfluenza type 3 virus
(PIV-3) is an important nosocomial pathogen causing
pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants. We report an
outbreak of PIV-3 respiratory infection in the
Department of Neonatology of KKH in June 2005. This
is the second PIV-3 outbreak in our unit after the first in
December 1994.
Methods: Retrospective review of the clinical
characteristics and outcome of 7 infants tested positive
for PIV-3 on nasopharyngeal aspirate in June 2005.
Results: 7 cases were infected with PIV-3 during this
outbreak. Mean birthweight of affected infants was
1370g (range 740g-2585g) and mean gestational age
was 29 weeks (range 24-35 weeks). Apnoeas and
bradycardias were the significant symptoms in 3 infants.
5 infants had progressive respiratory distress while 2
infants had flu-like illness. 5 infants required ventilatory
support. There were no deaths. The index case was an
infant with chronic lung disease who was on oxygen
supplementation and subsequently required ventilatory
support with nasal CPAP +6 with increasing oxygen
requirements. She continues to have severe post-viral
hyper-reactivity and is still hospitalised. Early
identification with strict cohorting of infected cases was
implemented. Contact tracing and screening of contact
cases was done. Hand hygiene precautions were
reinforced.
Conclusions: PIV-3 respiratory infections in infants can
present with non-specific symptoms, leading to
significant morbidity. Early recognition of symptoms
and detection is necessary to limit extent of infection,
institute ventilatory support promptly and avoid
unnecessary investigations and treatment. Though
infrequent, nosocomial respiratory infection is a
significant cause of morbidity in infants, especially in
those with underlying pulmonary pathology.
A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE
REPORTS OF ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE
PROGRAMME FOR INFECTION CONTROL IN
1999 AND 2005 – DEPARTMENT OF
NEONATOLOGY
M Dzarlieva
Department of Neonatology, Hospital, Bitola,
Macedonia
Background and Aims: The Epidemiology Service
does four visits on average over one year. Each one of
those visits contains from 15 to 20 smear samples, based
on variation of requirements. To compare the
microbiological analysis of the smears collected in 1999
with the ones collected in 2005.
Methods: The material used were the reports of
nosocomial infections of the Epidemiology Service in
these two different years.
Results: In 1999, from the total number of 482 smear
samples collected from around the hospital, 58 (12.0%)
were positive, 13 of which (23.6%) were from a smaller
collection of 55 samples taken at the Department of
Neonatology. As a figure form the overall hospital
collection, these 13 represent 22.4% of the entirety of
positive ones. The sample contained 24 smears from
objects of general use, 7 obtained from noses, 12 from
skin and 12 from eyes. In 2005, from the total number of
397 smear samples, 114 (28.7%) were diagnosed
positive. From the collected 37 samples at The
Department of Neonatology, 12 were positive, which
makes up 10.5% from the entire number of smears
accumulated from the whole hospital. The sample of
positive ones consisted of 23 smear samples from
objects of general use, 7 from noses, 4 from eyes, 2
from skin and 1 from a breast.
Conclusions: The reduction from 22.4% in 1999 to
10.5% in 2005 of positive isolations can be perceived
very evidently.
NON TYPABLE HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE

Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Athens Medical Centre,
Athens, Greece
Background and Aims: Meningitis due to CSF leakage
is a complication of skull base trauma. There is,
however, no clear consensus regarding the use of
antibiotic prophylaxis following such trauma.
Methods: A 3 year old girl was hospitalized for acute
meningitis, occurring 24 hours after an orbito-maxillar
trauma.
Results: The girl was previously healthy and vaccinated
for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus
influenzae. She was involved in a car crash, causing her
an injury of the left eye and maxilla. Initial cranial-facial
X-ray was unremarkable. Fever and vomiting began 12
hours after the injury, followed by nuchal rigidity and
impaired consciousness. In addition to a left lower
eyelid haematoma, a purulent conjunctivitis and
nasopharyngeal congestion were noticed. CSF contained
6000 cells/mm3 and culture yielded 140 CFU/ml of non
typable Haemophilus influenzae beta-lactamase
positive. Nasopharyngeal aspirate culture performed
after one dose of ceftriaxone yielded Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis and
Staphylococcus aureus. Computed tomography
documented a medial wall fracture of the orbit.
Bacteriological eradication was sustained 48 hours after
the beginning of ceftriaxone, which was continued for
14 days intravenously. Amoxicillin-clavulanate and
rifampicin were then administered orally for 14 days for
prophylaxis, with no relapse during this period.
Conclusions: In skull base trauma of young children,
CSF leakage should be investigated thoroughly and
antibiotic prophylaxis for meningitis may be considered.
Purulent conjunctivitis and nasopharyngeal congestion
could indicate a rapid onset of this complication.

Background and Aims: To investigate the phenotypes
of Haemophilus influenzae isolated from low respiratory
tract infection children and the manifestations of these
cases.
Methods: Sputum specimens for bacterial cultures,
were collected in all low respiratory tract infection
children during August 2001 to July 2002, and clinical
materials were collected in cases whose etiology were
identified as Haemophilus influenzae. Serotypes were
performed with slide agglutination method, and the
sensitivities of 216 strains of Haemophilus influenzae
against 13 antibiotics were determined in vitro by disc
diffusion methods.
Results: Of all 216 strains isolated from low respiratory
tract infection children, 82 strains (38.0%) were typable
and 89.0% of them belonged to type d, followed by type
c (6.1%), f (2.4%), b (1.2%) and a (1.2%), while 134
strains (62.0%) were nontypable. Higher incidence of
typable Haemophilus influenzae was found in male
(61/142, 43.0%) than that in female (21/74,28.4%) and
the difference was significant P<0.05. Thirty-nine
isolates (18.1%) were -lactamase-positive and 10
strains could not grow on medium in antibiotics
sensitivity test. Of all 206 isolates tested successfully,
83.5% were susceptible to ampicillin, and the sensitivity
rates to cefaclor, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and
clarithromycin were as high as 98.5%, 99.5%, 99.5%
and 91.7%, respectively. All strains were sensitive to
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin/sulbactan and
imipenem.
Conclusions: Both nontypable and type d are major
cause in low respiratory tract infection in children due to
Haemophilus influenzae, and ampicillin or other -
lactam actibiotics are still the choices for treatment of
infections with Haemophilus influenzae.

Background and Aims: Il-6 is early and sensitive
marker, CRP is late and specific, but elastase is a direct
measure for the granulocytes. The aim is to assess
correlation between Il-6, elastase and CRP in preterm
infants as early markers.
Methods: 18 infected premature infants with proven
sepsis were analized at the NICU with BW in average
2.74 kg. and GA 35 ± 5.2. There were 3 blood samples:
1) at the admission before given antibiotics 2) after 48-
72h. 3) after 5-7 days. The group was analysed and
compared for a range of perinatal and neonatal factors
and analysed using ANOVA for conttinuous variables
and contingency tables for categorical variables.
Results: The results revealed that the concentration of
Il-6 is statistically significant in infants with bacterial
infection on first day of life compared with control. The
severity of the disease correlates with the risk for death
in the first 24-48h. A significant correlation between Il-6
and CRP showed that higher Il-6 and lower CRP in the
first analysis and if higher the concentration of CRP and
Il-6 the infection is more severe. All infants with sepsis
showed statistically higher values of elastase after 24h.
Conclusions: Careful monitoring of the dynamics of
CRP and Il-6 are useful in administrating antibiotics. Il-
6 is early and sensitive marker and CRP is late and
specific, but the combination of both is the most secure
marker. So if both are negative after 48h. the treatment
with antibiotics should be cut off. Elastase is a good
marker for the follow up.

Background and Aims: Botulism is a rare condition,
caused by a neurotoxin produced from Clostridium
botulinum.
Results: A 12 years old adolescent was brought to the
Emergency Room with blurred vision and diplopia
initiated in the previously 12h. He also mentioned
constipation in the formerly 2 days and paresthesias in
the earlier 4 days. One week sooner, he had abdominal
pain and diarrhea that last 1 day. He mentioned the
ingestion of commercially produced mushrooms and
fast-food 1 day before. It was only found dilated pupils.
The routine analysis and the cerebral TC didn’t show
any alteration. At that time foodborne botulism was
thought. In the next 12h he developed ptosis and
extraocular muscle weakness. Serum and stools
specimens were collected. It was administrated trivalent
antitoxin. Five days after admission he as initiated
weakness and diminished tendons reflexes of the upper
extremities. The lumbar puncture performed was
normal. The electromyography revealed an incremental
increase in amplitude to rapid repetitive stimulation.
Since then the clinical features suffered a favourable
evolution. Nine days after admission it was confirmed
the diagnosis by the identification of the B toxin. He
was released home. Six months later is physical exam
was normal.
Conclusions: In the reported cases in our country the
antitoxin administration was not performed but the
evolution were less favourable than in our case. It’s
essential to make survey’s in our country to question
legitimise of the antitoxin administration, one that it was
only found B and E type, and not the lethally A type.

Deu, Barcelona, Spain
Background and Aims: Bacterial infection in
bronchiolitis is usual although is more frequent and
serious in PICU patients. To characterize bacterial
infections in infants with bronchiolitis at PICU.
Methods: Prospective, observational study. Data from
infants with bronchiolitis admitted at PICU from 2004
to 2005 was collected and compared with 2002-2003
period. CDC definitions for nosocomial infection were
used.
Results: Were enrolled 72 patients, 45 were male
(62.5%). Mean age was 1.93 (DS±2.69) months and
23.6% were expremature. Wood Downes-modified
score gravity at admission was 10.6 (DS±2.8).
Respiratory Syncitial virus was positive in 52.8%.
Antibiotherapy was indicated in 40 cases (55.6%)
related to clinical infection suspicion (7.5%), chest-ray
alterations (41.6%) analytic suspicion (43.9%) and other
causes (7%). Final diagnostics were respiratory tract
infection in 30 cases (41.6%), urinary tract infections in
4 (5.6%) and 6 sepsis (8.3%). There was isolated some
bacteria in 35% from antibiotic treated infants. In
tracheal sample were 5 Haemophilus influenzae, 3
streptococcues pneumoniae and 1 moraxella catarralis;
in urine culture 2 E.coli, 1 Enterobacter cloacae and 1
candida sp; and a Streptococcus pneumoniae from blood
isolation. Fourteen infants required ionotropics related
to bacterial infection. The PICU stay was significative
longer in infants with infectious complication (mean 4.2
days versus 6.4) p=0.04. Any infected patients become
exitus. All data was similar to 2002-03 years, despite
antibiotherapy: indicated in 88.3% patients, p= 0.03.
Conclusions: Respiratory tract infection was the most
frequent bacterial infection in bronchiolitis. It results in
a higher morbidity and longer stay at PICU.

Background and Aims: Kawasaki disease is an acute
systemic vasculitis that occurs predominantly in
children younger than 5 years of age. The cause of
Kawasaki disease remains unknown. On the basis of
clinical and epidemiologic features, Kawasaki disease is
widely believed to have an infectious cause.
Methods: Case: A 9-month-old female infant was
admitted to our hospital for the treatment of fever of
unknown origin. She had erythema of the oral and
pharyngeal mucosa, nonexudative conjunctivitis, and
extreme irritability. Her leukocyte was 23.100/mm³;
hemoglobin level was 10.1 g/dl; C-reactive protein level
was 146 mg/L, and ESR was 116 mm/h. No bacterial or
fungal agent grew on cultures of blood or urine samples.
The results of serologic tests for CMV IgM and IgG
were positive. CMV DNA was identified by polymerase
chain reaction in a blood sample. Echocardiogram
showed a slight dilatation of the coronary arteries and
pericardial effusion. The diagnosis was Kawasaki
disease.
Conclusions: Our case report suggests that patients with
Kawasaki Disease should be tested for CMV infection,
and the results of that observation imply something
more than coincidence.
REALIZATION OF CALENDAR OF
VACCINATIONS IN PUBLIC AND NOT-PUBLIC
PRACTICES
A Nitsch-Osuch, E Gyrczuk, A Wardyn
Department of Family Medicine, Warsaw, Poland
Background and Aims: Polish calendar of vaccinations
consists of: obligatory (paid by government) and
recommended (paid by patients) vaccinations (including
- 330 -
for example acellular pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae,
varicella, hepatitis A vaccinations).
Methods: The aim of our study was to find out
differences in realization of the calendar of vaccinations
in public family practices (PFP) and non-public family
practices (NFP).
Results: We compared the realization of calendar of
vaccinations in one public and one non-public family
practice in 2005. We estimated number of dosages of
recommended vaccinations (including acellular pertussis
and Haemophilus influenzae vaccinations) in public and
non-public family practice. There were 287 and 143
children aged 0-24 months respectively in NPF and PFP.
In the non-public family practice 838/842 (99%)
dosages of DTPa were administrated while in public
family practice only 67/384 (17,5%) dosages of DTPa
were given (the rest were the whole cell pertussis
vaccine - DTPw). In a NPF all children were vaccinated
against Haemophilus influenzae while in a PFP - 19/143
(19%) children.
Conclusions: The recommend vaccinations are more
often prescribed in non-public family practice. It may be
a result of: better financial status of patients who belong
to nonpublic family practice, better contact between
doctors and patents (patients) in non-public practices
(doctors have more time for visits so they are able to
explain and encourage parents to use recommended
vaccines). The aim of public family practices should be
more often usage of recommended vaccines among their
patients.

Background and Aims: Atypical KD is defined as a
fever of more than five days duration in the presence of
less than four of the five classical clinical criteria. Here
we report one child with marked pulmonary symptoms
in the course of Kawasaki disease who was initially
diagnosed with pneumonia.
Methods: A 2 year old, previously healthy boy, was
hospitalised with prolonged fever and 'unresolving
pneumonia'. He developed a temperature up to 40 C and
was initially diagnosed as having bullous myringitis; he
was treated with Amoxycillin. On the fifth day of fever
he was referred to the emergency department for further
evaluation. The only positive physical examination
findings were mild oropharyngeal erythema, small
submandibular lymph nodes, and left bullous myringitis.
There were no respiratory symptoms or signs.
Results: Initial laboratory results showed leucocytosis
with mildly elevated ESR and CRP. Chest radiographs
revealed consolidation in the upper part of the right
lobe. He was treated with IV Ceftriaxone for 3 days but
the fever persisted, although the XR findings were
resolved. His 8 th day of the illness he developed
conjunctivitis and cheilitis and was treated with IVIG as
an atypical Kawasaki. The fever subsided after 24 hrs
and on the 10th day marked thrombocytosis was noted.
There were no Coronary Arteries Aneurysms (CAA) on
echocardiograms performed on 2nd and 6th week of
illness.
Conclusions: In summary, we have shown that atypical
KD can present as prolonged fever with lobar
pneumonia. Early clinical suspicion and therapy can
reduce the risk of developing CAA .
A CASE OF MILIARY T.B. WITH

Department of Pediatrics, Isfahan University of Medical
Sciences, Isfahan, Iran
Background and Aims: Tuberculosis is a contagious
infectious disease that is still common in Iran. It may
appear in different patterns. Its symptoms are depends
on host immunity, age and disease severity. Miliary T.B
and meningitis usually occurs in early years of life.
Pulmonary symptoms, hepatosplenomegally,
generalized lymphadenopathy are seen in military form
Methods: It is a case report article.
Results: We report a 5 year old girl with miliary T.B
and meningitis without hepatosplenomegally. She was
referred to pediatrics emergency room with fever and
productive cough. She had been sick since 6 months
ago. She complained from fever, lymph node
enlargement and diaphoresis. This patient had been
maltreated as a case of asthma due to dyspnea,
productive cough and fever. She has also has been
treated with so many antibiotics. Even laryngoscopy
was done purposelessly. Unfortunately these drugs had
postponed the patient's diagnosis and treatment.
Conclusions: T.B evaluation is suggested in children
with chronic cough, fever and weight loss and especially
brain C.T scan may help us to evaluate military T.B
cases who are suffering from meningitis too.

Paediatric Service, Hospital São João de Deus, Vila
Nova de Famalicão, Portugal
Background and Aims: Kawasaki Disease (KD) is a
syndrome of unknown etiology, defined by well
established clinical features (Classical Kawasaki
Disease). In the last years, it has been recognised forms
of the disease that do not full fill sufficient clinical
criteria (Incomplete Kawasaki Disease) most in infants
who have higher risk of cardiovascular disease. The
presence of additional laboratory or ecographic criteria,
establish the diagnosis in this cases and the need of
treatment.
Methods: Revision the clinical cases of incomplete
Kawasaki Disease by medical registrations.
Results: We had two cases on infants during 2005. A
six months old boy admitted with 3 days of fever and
macular rash. On fifth day of disease began bilateral
- 331 -
conjunctival injection, fissured lips and skin
descamation. He presented leucocitosis, elevated C-
reactive protein and erythrosedimentation rate, increase
platelet count and sterile pyuria. A two months old girl
admitted with fever, irritability and diffuse
maculopapular rash with perineal descamation for 24
hours. Extremities changes with desquamation on the
9th day. She had elevated C-reactive protein and
transaminases, anemia, increased platelet count, low
albumin and pyuria. Both infants had normal
ecocardiographic studies and began treatment with
immunoglobulin and salicilate, with good clinical
response.
Conclusions: Early treatment of KD is important for
minimise the risk of cardiovascular disease and have a
better outcome. It is important to recognise incomplete
forms of the disease or occurrence in infancy to
establish early treatment.

Background and Aims: Meningococcal disease (MCD)
is responsible for a large number of deaths among
children. This study assessed the intervals between
symptom onset, clinical assessment and antibiotic
administration.
Methods: A retrospective review of hospital records
and laboratory data of confirmed and presumed MCD
deaths in children aged 0-18 in New Zealand during the
serogroup B epidemic 1991-2004.
Results: Clinical records were available on 82 of 135
(61%) fatal cases. Confirmed MCD was present in 79%.
Clinical diagnosis from the records suggested 52% with
septicaemia alone, 41% with mixed disease, and 5%
with meningitis alone. The median age was 2 years
(range 0-18). 59% (48) of the cohort had one or more
consultations with a doctor prior to hospital presentation
yet only 38% (18) received antibiotics prior to hospital
presentation. Only 60% of patients received antibiotics
within 2 hours of their first medical consultation. Death
occurred rapidly within the cohort with 76% dying
within 24 hours of hospital presentation.
Conclusions: Deaths from MCD in our cohort occurred
rapidly, which is common to all MCD death cohorts.
Although early antibiotic administration has been shown
to save lives, many of those who died did not receive
antibiotics at the earliest opportunity. A delay of more
than two hours was seen in 40% of the cohort. The
availability of improved diagnostic markers is urgently
required to ensure antibiotics are administered at the
earliest possible opportunity.
INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND UNEXPECTED
DEATH OF CHILDREN - PROBLEMS, REASONS
AND PROGNOSIS
N P Skorodumova
Chair of Children Disease and Children Infections,
Donetsk State Medical University, Donetsk, Ukraine
Background and Aims: Infections play the main role
among the reasons of unexpected death of children.
Methods: We have analyzed 80 cases of unexpected
death of children of the first year, which took place in
out of hospital departments. In 88,7% of children the
death took place on the background of non-diagnostic
infections diseases (meningococcous infection,
encephalitis, leptomeningitis, generalized viral, viral-
bacterial infection).
Results: The main reasons of death in group of neuro-
infectious were: infectious-toxic shock, edema of brain
end lungs, acute adrenal deficiency, syndrome of
disseminated intravascular coagulation. Death of 68,7%
of children took place on the background of the acute
respiratory viral infection because of reason of edema
and swelling of brain, acute violation of
microcirculation, cardiopulmonary deficiency. Gealin
membranes were discovered in 8% of children. Children
of 6-12 months died more often, men (52,1%0, with low
weight in birth, with the indexes of Apgar scale low than
6. As a rule, (95,4%) children died at night during
sleeping, more often in autumn-winter season, of the
year. 54,7% of mothers were before 20 years old, 32,1%
were exposure of much artificial abortion, in 38% of
women the pregnancy developed with toxicosis, 39,1%
smoked during pregnancy, 31% of women drenched,
24,1% took different medicines.
Conclusions: The totality of enumerated negative
factors determine the prognosis of development of
unexpected death in children and dictate the necessity of
detachment of them in «risk group» the elaboration of
schema of clinical examination.

Background and Aims: To determine the epidem-
iology and antifungal susceptibility of blood and lung
fungal infections, in PICU patients.
Methods: Retrospective study. All patients admitted to
the PICU over a 6year period (2000-2006) with blood
and/or Bal cultures positive for fungal infection. The
Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) were
determined.
Results: 66 patients (35 girls, 31 boys), mean age 4
years. 5 of them (7,8%) had a blood positive infection:
isolates were 60% Candida (20% C.Albicans, 20%
C.Tropicalis, 20% C.Mananis) and 40% Aspergillus
Flavus. In 61 children (92,4%) with Bal positive
infections: 67% had Candida, 26% Aspergillus,7% both.
Candida group: 9% C.Albicans, 17% C.Tropicalis, 15%
- 332 -
C.Parapsilosis, 5% C.Quilliermondii, 2% C.Glabrata,
2% C.Krusei. Aspergillus group: 50% A.Fumigatus,
31%A.Flavus, 7% A.Restrictum, 6% A.Penicillioides,
6% A.Terreus. In 44% cultures were (+) on admission,
in 56% became (+) after a mean of 16 days and sterile
after a mean of 17 days. E-test susceptibility for
Candida: AmphotericineB > Ketoconazole >
Intraconazole > 5Fluorocytocine > Voriconazole > F
luconazole > Caspofungine and for
Aspergillus:AmphotericineB > Voriconazole >
Ketoconazole > Caspofungine >Intraconazole >
5Fluorocytocine.
Conclusions: Blood fungal infections mortality was
80% compared to Bal (Candida 24%, Aspergillus 37%).
C.Albicans is the commonest pathogen with a shift
toward non Albicans spp during the last 3 years.
AmphotericineB remains the drug of choice for Candida
and Aspergillus.

Background and Aims: The emergence of MRSA in a
critical care setting in a developing country has both
health related concerns as well as serious financial
implications.
Methods: A one year prospective study was undertaken
to study the microbiological profile of nosocomial
infections in PICU from April 2000 to March 2001. In
September 2000, MRSA was isolated from the patients
and the environmental samples were sent for phage
typing. During the outbreak, an MRSA case was defined
as any patient in the PICU with MRSA colonization or
clinical disease. Before sending for phage typing, the
Staph aureus cultures were subcultured. All bacterial
isolates were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity testing.
Results: 6 patients had MRSA isolated from their blood.
All these patients had copious secretions requiring
frequent suctioning. The duration of stay in PICU before
MRSA was isolated ranged from 5 days to 22 days. All
MRSA isolates were highly drug resistant being
sensitive only to vancomycin and rifampicin. Phage
typing of MRSA isolated from these patients as well as
those from portable suction pump revealed non-typable
MRSA, thus tracing the sources of outbreak to the
portable suction pump. The PICU remained closed for 2
wks until two sets of surveillance cultures were
negative.
Conclusions: This outbreak demonstrated that lack of
adherence to infection control guidelines in a intensive
care setup can lead to grave consequences. It also
demonstrates the role of extensive surveillance (both
environmental and personnel) in the event of an
outbreak of nosocomial infection in an intensive care
unit.
A DEDICATED PAEDIATRIC RETRIEVAL
TEAM CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE
MANAGEMENT OF PERSISTENT PULMONARY
HYPERTENSION OF THE NEWBORN
A Deep, A Desai, A Petros, D Lutman, M Montgomery
The Children's Acute Transport Service, London, UK
Background and Aims: The Children’s Acute
Transport Service (CATS) transports over 1200
critically ill children/neonates (>85% ventilated)
annually. We aimed to audit outborn cases of persistent
pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)
referred for ECMO.
Methods: Case note audit of 135 consecutive cases
(November 2001-August 2005).
Results: Two did not require transport. Of the
remaining 133 (male:female 1.7:1) the commonest
aetiology was meconium aspiration (48%). Median (+
interquartile range) gestational age was 38 (34-40)
weeks, age at referral 19.2 (9-31) hours, and weight 3.2
(2.8-3.62) kg. Stabilisation time was 153.5 (125-195)
minutes, 111 (83%) received 20ppm nitric oxide, and
two died with the CATS team present. Twenty (15%)
underwent ECMO. Calculated risk of mortality deduced
from PIM2 scores was higher for neonates referred aged
<12 cf >12 hours (n=48 vs 42: Risk of mortality - 29.2
vs. 21.1 respectively, p=0.02), and >24 cf <24 hours
(n=35 vs 90, Risk of mortality-22.5 vs 25.15
respectively, p=0.04). Stabilization times were 153.5
(110-195), 152.5 (130-182.5), 150 (130-185) and 157.5
(127.5-180) min for <12, >12, <24, and >24
respectively.
Conclusions: (1) Risk of mortality calculated from
PIM2 scores was inversely related to post-natal age,
consistent with worse disease severity or lack of time for
initial dynamic pulmonary vascular resistance to relax.
(2) Stabilisation times were independent of PIM2.
(3) Despite outborn neonates referred for ECMO being
likely to represent more severe PPHN, mortality was
only 1.5%: an experienced specialist service can safely
transfer the majority of even severe PPHN cases.
ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA PREVENTION IN
INFANTS, USING ACE INHIBITORS
P Avram, M Craiu, A V Cochino
Institute for Mother and Child Care, Bucharest,
Romania
Background and Aims: In adults studies, protective
respiratory outcome was documented for ACE-
inhibitors treatment. 1. ACE inhibitors play a role in
setting the threshold for the cough and swallowing
reflex in humans. 2. No data is available for pediatric
population.
Methods: Six months case control prospective study in
6 infants with severe neurologic impairment (birth
asphyxia). They were treated by nasogastric (NG) tube,
with captopril (0.7-1 mg/kg/day). Control group: 14
infants, admitted in the same unit. All patients had
cardiovascular assessment (exclusion criteria included
congenital heart disease and hypotension).
Results: In the captopril group, 2 episodes of aspiration
pneumonia (2 cases/3 patient-year); were documented
- 333 -
(clinically and radiologically) in control group were 20
such episodes (20/7 patient-year). Four of the episodes
from the control group and none from the captopril
group were severe and prolonged, eventually receiving
mechanical ventilation. None of the children died.
Conclusions: 1. Captopril has proven efficiency in
preventing aspiration pneumonia in neurological
compromized patients (OR=0.23 for pneumonia in the
captopril group). 2. There were no secondary effects
related to captopril at the used dosage. 3. Further studies
are required to document these findings. Bibliography:

Background and Aims: The rate of varicella and the
persistence of varicella antibody after a one dose
regimen of varicella virus vaccine in healthy children, in
a Polish village, were compared after 46 days and after
13 months.
Methods: 106 healthy children (5 9girls, 47 boys), with
no history of varicella, were vaccinated with
VARILRIX® (GSK) between March and April 2004.
The subjects were aged 9 months to 12 years (median-
47 months). After 46 days (group-VE1) and 13 months
(group-VE2), the concentration of IgG-antibody against
VZV was measured using the ELISA IgGTestkit.
Results: No local or general symptoms were observed
after vaccination. Two vaccinated children with
borderline values (9-11VE) developed a mild form of
varicella one year after completing the vaccination
regimen. 46 days after vaccination the seroconversion
rate was 103 (97.2%) of 106. The seroconversion rate
was 83 (78.3%) of 106 patients 13 months after
vaccination. The GMT in group VE1 was 19.4 (95%CI-
9.5,23.1) and 15.0 (95%CI-15.5,23.1) in group VE2
respectively and was significantly lower after one year
(p<0.001). In both groups no significant statistical
differences were noted between antibody levels in girls
(VE1-19.0; VE2-15.1) and boys (VE1-19.8;VE2-14.9).
In children under 7 years of age (N=58) and in older
children (N=48) there were no significant statistical
differences between antibody levels both after 46 days
and 13 months (VE1-17.9;VE2-14.6 and VE1-21.3;
VE2-15.5 respectively).
Conclusions: Varicella vaccine was 98.1% effective in
preventing varicella. After one year, antibody titers were
negative in 21.7% children. Booster vaccinations or a
two dose regimen of varicella vaccine might be
considered to prevent breakthrough infection.

Background and Aims: Recording of clinical-
epidemiological data from children with measles from
9/2005 until 7/2006.
Methods: 112 children, 1:1 male-female ratio, aged 7
months -12 years old (mean age 3yo), verified by Elisa
and indirect immunofluorescence.
Results: Population distribution: 50% Roma, 25%
Greek, 25% children of immigrants. 97% were not
vaccinated, 3% received one dose MMR. 22% were <24
months old, 65.5% 2-5 yo, 12.5% over 6 yo. Mean
duration of hospitalization was 4.5 days. Serological
confirmation was established in 4 cases (3.5%) that
clinical data was insufficient. In 41% the manifestations
were atypical. Complications rose in 91%, 72% as upper
respiratory infections, 3% as GI complications, 3% as
CNS involvement of which two children were admitted
in the ICU. The outcome was excellent in all cases.
Source of infection was family 31% and 12.5%
Outpatient-clinic visit, compatible with the incubation
time.
Conclusions: 1. The clinical outcome was excellent.
2. The Roma population has a significant number of
children that are not vaccinated. 3. The atypical clinical
manifestations may be contributed at the small age of
the children (<15 m.o.) and possibly at the virulence of
measles virus. 4. The outbreak is a critical alert for the
intensification of measles vaccination in Greece.

subsystem is organised in 3 regions: North, Center and
South. Center Region transfer was extended to children
up to 14, since 2004. The authors aim to describe the
neonatal and paediatric transport model of Portuguese
Center Region and present the quantity and nature of the
transfers.
Methods: To describe the neonatal and paediatric
transport model, of Portuguese Center Region and
present transfers' data during 1991-2005.
Results: Regionalisation Center Net comprehends 3
tertiary care hospitals (Polyvalent Intensive Care Unit in
Hospital Pediátrico de Coimbra, headquarters of
coordination of the transport service and 2 NICU in
Maternities) and 8 secondary care hospitals that cover
an area of 23.672Km2 and a population of 16.900 live
- 334 -
birth/year and 261.000 children up to 14 years. The team
includes an intensive care senior paediatrician and nurse
available by a single phone number 24h/day. There were
2997 transfers (not transported 51: dead prior to team
arrival - 31; without indication - 20). They were 2480
newborns (<1000g: 8,9%, 1000-1499g: 17,4%, 1500-
2499g: 25,7%), 443 infants and 36 children. Boys -
60%. The main diagnoses were: prematurity,
cardiorespiratory problems and malformations. Medical
procedures: mechanical ventilation - 47,8%, inotropics -
25,8%; central catheterization - 41,7%, surfactant
administration - 7%. Destination: NICU/PICU - 48,4%,
surgery-14,8%, secondary care hospitals - 21,1%,
complementary exams - 15,7%.
Conclusions: Throughout 15 years, our transfer system,
as a part of Regionalisation, proved its effectiveness and
efficiency, and with the same team it was possible to
extend it to children up to 14 years.

Department of Paediatrics, Craigavon Area Hospital,
Portadown, Co. Armagh, Northern Ireland
Background and Aims: Sick or injured children may
initially present to a unit, which provides adequate
resuscitation or stabilisation but is unable to offer
intensive care management. Such children must be
transported to another hospital or department. At present
there is no regional paediatric retrieval service in
Northern Ireland. Our aim was to review the transfer of
critically ill children from a non-tertiary care hospital to
the regional paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in the
Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, Northern
Ireland.
Methods: A forum was created using teleconferencing
facilities to present, discuss and critically evaluate
recently transferred cases. These cases were appraised
by expert review and involved the multidisciplinary
team involved in paediatric transport.
Results: Teleconferencing sessions have allowed
multidisciplinary learning and identified areas for
practice development; including documentation, clinical
guidelines, fluid/airway management and drug
administration. An inter-departmental group has been
established to progress these developments locally.
Conclusions: This review is facilitating non-tertiary
units to develop 'best practice', training and
multidisciplinary care-pathways in paediatric transport.
This model has been extended to create a network
involving a three-way teleconference between two non-
tertiary units and the regional PICU. We have found that
teleconferencing is popular with all staff incorporated
into an education program and permits sharing of
knowledge in a no-blame format with a greater
understanding of each other's capabilities and
limitations. This model may also benefit regions that
already have an established transport service, including
education and retention of skills for trainees who are no
longer involved in paediatric transfer.
INTRAOSSEOUS NEEDLE IN PAEDIATRIC
CRITICAL CARE TRANSPORT SETTING

Children's Acute Transport Services, London, UK
Background and Aims: To describe the frequency,
efficacy and complications of intraosseous needle (IO)
use for venous access during intensive care transport of
critically ill children. Setting: Paediatric critical care
transports performed by regionalized retrieval service.
Methods: Retrospective chart review was performed
from Nov 2001-Nov 2005. All children who were
referred for retrieval and required IO access during
resuscitation at hospital or during transport were
included. SPSS 10.0 was used for data analysis.
Results: 144 IO were placed in 114 children (54 males
and 60 females; 1.7% of all retrievals in that period)
during resuscitation and/or transport. Majority of
children (100/114, 87.7%) were transported to an
intensive care unit after successful resuscitation; 14
children died at the referring institution with the
retrieval team. Mean age was 12.8 ± 21.2 month (range:
1 days – 180 months) and mean weight was 8.0 ± 5.3
kg. IO’s were placed by referring paediatricians on
retrieval team’s advice in 64.9% children and by the
retrieval team in 25.4%. An average of 1.3 attempts
were made (maximum 5 attempts), with a first attempt
success rate of 82.5%. The IO was maintained for 4.2 ±
1.5 hours (range 2-9 hours). The main admitting
diagnoses included sepsis (23.7%), cardiac (21.9%) and
respiratory distress (19.3%). IO placement was mainly
for difficult intravenous access (55.8%),
cardiopulmonary arrest (25.4%) and shock (18.4%).
Complications were seen in 16.7% cases, mainly
displacement and local infiltration.
Conclusions: Intraosseous needle constitutes an
important means of venous access for initial
resuscitation and subsequent transport in critically ill
children.

Background and Aims: In the past the contagious
diseases have been taking many human lives or have left
difficult consequences on the human organisms with
permanent impairment. The source of contamination is
an ill person contaminated with this disease. The
provoker is the polio virus. The aim of the work is to
present the percentage of primovaccine and revaccine
coverage on pre-school and school children as well as
the morbidity and the epidemiology in the Medicine
Centre in Demir Kapija.
- 335 -
Methods: For the production of these materials there
are used vaccination cards and contagious diseases
evidence books for the period 1995- 2005.
Results: Results are shown numerically, tabularly.
Conclusions: The successfully carried out
vaccineprofilax 98.8% is a method for extermination
(eradication) of polio in our country. We hope it will
remain like that in the next millennium, too.
AN IMPORTED CASE OF CHOLERA

Department of Paediatrics, Hospital Fernando Fonseca,
Amadora, Portugal
Background and Aims: Even though cholera no longer
poses a threat to developed countries it is still able to be
imported from areas where it remains a devastating
cause of death. One should know when to suspect it,
effective methods for isolation of the Vibrio cholerae,
how to provide prompt treatment and management of
the contacts in order to avoid a major public-health
disaster.
Methods: Clinical case presentation.
Results: An eleven-year old girl was admitted to the
emergency unit in hypovolemic shock. She had arrived
in Portugal from Guinea-Bissau just the previous day.
Vomits and diarrhoea started 6 hours before admission.
Signs of severe dehydration were present along with
metabolic acidosis (pH:7.09, HCO3:15.3, EB:-14.6),
hyponatraemia (Na+:129mmol/L) and acute renal failure
(creatinine:2.3mg/dL). It was then observed profuse
painless diarrhoea with watery stools resembling 'rice
water' and facing this clinical picture cholera was
suspected. Fluid replacement was immediately started
along with doxycycline. In the first 24 hours she had lost
up to a total of 11 litres of stools. The local health
authority was reported and management of contacts
proceeded. On the 5th day diarrhoea and clinical
complications were solved. After two attempts,
diagnosis was finally confirmed by isolation of Vibrio
cholerae - serogroup O1 Inaba when alkaline peptone
water was used.
Conclusions: In Portugal throughout many decades
there were no reports of cholera, what made this case a
special challenge in diagnosis. Nowadays, one should
never underestimate the risk of importing highly
contagious disease and the possibility of an outbreak if
proper measures and diagnosis is delayed.
MORTALITY RATES OF A DEDICATED
PAEDIATRIC RETRIEVAL SERVICE

The Children's Acute Transport Service, London, UK
Background and Aims: The Children's Acute
Transport Service (CATS) is a dedicated transport
service for critically ill children and neonates requiring
Intensive care in North London. We reviewed data for
patients over a one year period to determine the
mortality rate from point of referral.
Methods: A retrospective review was performed of all
patients referred who died from December 2003 -
November 2004. Data extracted included death before
CATS mobilisation, death in presence of the CATS
team, death in presence of other teams, and death on
PICU within 6 hours of arrival. Calculated risk of
mortality (from PIM2) was reported.
Results: A total of 1658 patients were referred. The
mortality rate of patients referred was 7%. No patients
died on transport. 20 deaths occurred prior to CATS
mobilisation, 9 in the presence of the CATS team at the
referring unit and 2 when other teams were present. 19
deaths occurred in the PICU after transfer by CATS.
The calculated risk of mortality (from PIM2) of these 19
patients was 89.7 (IQR 78.6-94.9).
Conclusions: Our data support the view that a dedicated
retrieval service can successfully transfer extremely sick
children without mortality during transfer. Earlier
referral may enable a reduction in the number of deaths
at the referring institution.

Background and Aims: Hospital-acquired infections
are usual in PICU. It results in a higher morbidity and
mortality. Deaths attributable to nosocomial infection in
PICU are estimated in 11%. To describe the
epidemiology of nosocomial infections in our PICU.
Methods: Prospective and observational study was
performed in our unit from October to December 2005.
CDC definitions for nosocomial infections were used.
Results: Medical data from 134 patients was analyzed.
Were exposed to central venous catheter (CVC) 107
patients, to ventiloteraphy 67 and to urological catheter
110. Mean exposition days was 7.4 ± 7.1, 4.1 ± 4.0 and
5.0 ± 4.8 respectively with a mean stay in PICU of 5.3 ±
4.5 days. Twenty patients suffered nosocomial infection,
with 22 episodes (15% from patients exposed and 10%
of total admissions). Infection rate was 6,0
infections/100 patients-days stay and 11,0 infections/
100 admissions. The infection site was: urinary tract in
10 cases (45.5%), 3 primary bloodstream infection
(13.6%), pneumonia and respiratory tract infections in 6
(27.6%), septicemia related to CVC in 2 patients and
one case of bronchiolitis. The more frequent germs
isolated were enterobacterias (E coli and Enterobacter
sp): 7 cases in the urinary cultures, 3 in blood sample
and one in bronchoalveolar lavage. Length of exposition
to extern devices and stay in PICU (13.6 versus 3.9
- 336 -
days) were significantly longer in patients with
nosocomial infections, p 0.02.
Conclusions: Tract urinary and respiratory infections
were the most common nosocomial sites of infection.
Surveillance and prevention strategies are essential in
care units.
IMPROVING TRANSPORT MEDICINE: THE
IMPACT OF REFLECTIVE PRACTICE
T Vince
Childrens Acute Transport Service, London, UK
Background and Aims: Reflective practice is a useful
skill for all doctors to help maximise the learning benefit
of their experiences. This is imperative in critical care
transport where trainees work in foreign, exposed
environments. Consequently, critical examination of
practice is essential. This study evaluates the effect of
reflective practice on a group of paediatric critical care
trainees during an attachment to a specialised retrieval
service.
Methods: Trainees already maintained a mandatory
logbook of their retrievals. After receiving instruction
and on-going support, trainees recorded retrievals as
episodes of reflection over an 8-month. The impact on
trainees was gauged using semi-structured
questionnaires and interviews. These techniques also
explored factors that facilitated or hindered reflective
practice.
Results: Despite intensity of work and time constraints,
trainees were able to reflect on their practice. They
perceived benefits both in clinical management skills
and professional development, particularly in areas not
covered by conventional training. There was broad
agreement on organisational factors (time, service
requirements and training) as facilitators of reflection
and both organisational (time and extra work) and
emotional factors (fear of criticism, fear of competency
assessment) as barriers. Trainees were reluctant to
document reflections and preferred oral group sessions.
Conclusions: This study confirms that reflective
practice is beneficial. It is well suited to transport
medicine and may be used to augment current paediatric
training. However, some doctors will always find the
process unacceptable and implementing mandatory
reflection is likely to be counterproductive. Finding
suitable alternatives is challenging.

Background and Aims: Chorioamnionitis is a purulent
infection causing prematurity, neonatal sepsis and death.
Usual treatment ( -lactams and aminoglycosides) is not
optimal with the persistence of foetal bacteremia. So we
studied the efficacy of ciprofloxacin, active in pus and
not used in this indication, in a rabbit model of
chorioamnionitis.
Methods: 12 h after the intrauterine inoculation of E.
coli, 6 pregnant rabbits were treated with ciprofloxacin
(30mg/kg IV), 6 with ciprofloxacin + gentamicin
(10mg/kg IM) and 4 others were untreated (controls). At
12, 36 and 60 h after inoculation, caesarian was
performed. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by
the fœtal survival, maternal and foetal blood cultures
and tissular and amniotic liquid cultures.
Results: 60 h after inoculation, none of the untreated
fetus survived, the survival rate was significantly
increased in the ciprofloxacin and the ciprofloxacin +
gentamicin groups (46,7% and 71,2% with p=0,02 and
p=0,0003 vs untreated respectively). Ciprofloxacin
produced a dramatic reduction of fœtal bacteremia and
the sterilisation of maternal blood culture after 48h. The
association with gentamicin allowed the sterilization of
all the maternal and survival fœtal blood cultures as
soon as 24 h of treatment. The quantitative cultures of
amniotic liquid, lung, brain, liver and placenta were
significantly reduced after a 24h-treatment in the two
treated groups (p <0,001 vs controls).
Conclusions: Ciprofloxacin appears as an efficient
treatment of acute chorioamnionitis with better survival
rates and decreased quantitative blood cultures. The
addition of gentamicin improves the in vivo activity
with faster and greater bactericidal effect.
INSULIN RESISTANCE IN CHILDREN WITH
MENINGOCOCCAL SEPSIS: DOES IT OCCUR?
J J Verhoeven, A C S Hokken-Koelega, M den Brinker,
K F M Joosten
Department of Pediatric Intensive Care, Erasmus MC
Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Hyperglycemia (glucose > 8
mmol/l) in critically ill children with various diseases is
associated with increased mortality. It is not known
whether insulin therapy will be beneficial and which
children should be treated. The objective was to
investigate the occurrence of insulin resistance by
analyzing blood glucose levels in relation with insulin
levels in children with meningococcal sepsis.
Methods: Prospective observational study. In all
children with meningococcal sepsis on the pediatric
intensive care between October 1997 and May 2004
blood levels of glucose and insulin were analyzed on
admission and related with glucose intake and
corticosteroid use.
Results: 78 Children were included (59% male), mean
age 5,3 years (1 month-16 years), mean PRISM score
21. 10 children did not survive (13%). Hyperglycemia
was found in 38%. Non-survivors had a significant
lower blood glucose level compared to survivors (5 vs 8
mmol/l). High insulin glucose ratios were found both in
the group with low glucose (<4 mmol/l) and high
glucose (>11 mmol/l).
Conclusions: Hyperglycemia occurred in 40% of the
patients. In the group with hyperglycemia >11 mmol/l
the highest insulin-glucose ratios were seen, suggesting
insulin resistance. Hyperglycemia > 11 mmol/l was
- 337 -
correlated with higher age, higher glucose intake and
corticosteroid use.
EFFECT OF BETAMETHASONE ON CEREBRAL
BLOOD FLOW VELOCITIES IN PRETERM
NEONATES WITH SEVERE
BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA

J C Picaud
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Arnaud de Villeneuve
Hospital, University Hospital of Montpellier, France
Background and Aims: In fetal sheep, betamethasone
administration in late gestation exerts a major
vasoconstrictor effect on cerebral blood flow. In human
preterm infants, postnatal corticosteroids are associated
with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental delay, but
little is known about the haemodynamic involvement in
the occurrence of cerebral injury. We aimed to assess
the effects on cerebral blood flow velocities (CBFV) of
betamethasone (BM) given to premature infants for the
treatment of exceptionally severe bronchopulmonary
dysplasia (ESBPD).
Methods: We prospectively measured CBFV in
subjects treated with BM for ESBPD and life-
threatening conditions. BM dosage was 0.5-0.5-0.5-0.3-
0.3-0.1mg/kg/d. After standardization of the procedure,
CBFV were recorded in the anterior cerebral (ACA) and
the lenticulostriate arteries (LSA) before and 2 hours
after each dose of BM. Results expressed as mean
(SEM) and analyzed using repeated-measure ANOVAs.
Results: Ten neonates [BW:737(46)g, GA:25.5 (0.3)
weeks] were studied at 34(3) days of life. In the ACA
and LSA, both systolic (S) and diastolic (D) velocities
significantly decreased during BM treatment. The
resistance index (RI) increased in the ACA over the
treatment period [baseline: 0.78 (0.01), d1: 0.83 (0.02)*,
d3: 0.83 (0.01)*, d5: 0.89 (0.01)*, d8: 0.81 (0.01),
p<0.05], whereas the increase in LSA was significant
only at day3.
Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis of a
vasoconstrictor effect of betamethasone in premature
infants with ESBPD. This effect may be implicated in
the occurrence of brain injury and later neuro-
developmental delay in this specific population.
DELAYED NEURAL CONDUCTION IN THE
AUDITORY BRAINSTEM IN PRETERM
INFANTS WITH CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE
Z D Jiang, D M Brosi, A R Wilkinson
Department of Pediatrics, University of Oxford, John
Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK
Background and Aims: Neonatal chronic lung disease
(CLD) is known to affect growth and development of
the immature brain. However, it is not known whether
infants with neonatal CLD are at risk of auditory
deficits. This study aims to detect functional
abnormality in the auditory brainstem at term in preterm
infants with CLD.
Methods: We recruited 25 preterm infants who suffered
neonatal CLD, with gestational age 23-30 wks. None
had any concomitant other major perinatal problems. At
37-42 wks postconceptional age, brainstem auditory
evoked response (BAER) was recorded with clicks of
21-91/s.
Results: Compared to those recorded in normal term
controls, BAER wave V latency and I-V and III-V
interpeak intervals in the CLD infants increased
significantly (ANOVA p <0.01-0.001). The latencies of
waves I and III did not differ significantly from the
controls. However, no abnormalities were found in
BAER wave amplitudes. These BAER findings were
seen at all click rates 21-91/s, although the increase in
III-V interval tended to be more significant at higher
rates compared to those at lower rates. Click rate-
dependent changes in BAER variables in the CLD
infants were generally similar to the term controls,
although slightly different.
Conclusions: BAER components, mainly reflecting
central auditory function, in the preterm infants with
CLD increased significantly. The increase in wave V
latency and I-V interval is due to the increase in III-V
interval. These results suggest that there is delayed
neural conduction in the more central portion of the
auditory brainstem following neonatal CLD.
PILOT STUDY USING NIRO-200 IN VERY LOW
BIRTH WEIGHT (VLBW) INFANTS TO ASSESS
CEREBRAL AUTOREGULATION
A C Doolan, A R Twomey
National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, Ireland
Background and Aims: Near Infrared Spectroscopy
(NIRO) uses light spectroscopy, to provide us with
information about oxygenation within the tissues,
measuring changes in the concentration of oxygenated
haemoglobin (Hb02), deoxygenated haemoglobin
(HHb), total haemoglobin (HbT), tissue oxygenation
index (TOI) and tissue haemoglobin index (THI), thus
giving us information about brain oxygenation, cerebral
blood volume and cerebral blood flow.
Methods: The aim was to observe if infants <1.5kg
demonstrated evidence of cerebral autoregulation in
response to position changes. A total of 12 VLBW
babies were observed on Day 1, 2 and 3. The NIRO-200
(Hamamatsu) was used to record Hb02, HHb, HbT, TOI
and THI. The changes in these variables in response to
the tilt and changes in vital signs were recorded. Infants
with a CRIB score of 6+ were considered separately to
those who were assigned a score of 5 or less.
Results: Of the 12 babies included, 8 were male and 4
were female with an average gestation of 29+4 and
weight of 1.08kg. There were 8 babies in the group with
CRIB score of 5 or less, with 4 babies in the more
unwell group. Statistically significant differences were
- 338 -
seen in the two group's response to tilt. Stable babies
had an increase in HbO2 and HbT and an increase in
BP. Sicker babies tended to drop their HbO2, HbT and
THI and BP.
Conclusions: The purpose of our study was to observe
the effect of change in position in VLBW infants. Our
study would suggest that more unstable babies show
impaired cerebral autoregulation.
ULTRASOUND DIAGNOSIS OF HYPOXIC-
ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY IN NEWBORNS
B A Burov
Tashkent Medical Institute of Postgraduate Education,
Tashkent, Uzbekistan
Background and Aims: Hypoxic-ischemic damages of
the brain in newborns is the significant current problem
of neonatology. The lesions of the nervous system
account for 50% in the structure of the pediatric
disability. The diseases of nervous system are related to
perinatal factors in 70-80%.
Methods: Neurological symptoms do not always reflect
the character and severity degree of the central nervous
system damage, and so ultrasound diagnosis has the
important role in the identification of these pathologies.
Neurosonography is one of the current methods of
ultrasound diagnosis of encephalopathy.
Results: Investigation was carried out on 110 premature
newborns with encephalopathy. There were studied data
of medical history, risk factors of the period of
gestation. There was noted high frequency of preterm
deliveries. Among the neurological symptoms the
symptom of Grefe, strained look, pathological increase
in muscular tone, clonic-tonic convulsions are prevailed.
Neurosonography of 38 (34,55%) infants revealed
isolated peri-intraventricular hemorrhages of the 1st
degree and hemorrhages of the second degree were
found in 12 (10,91%). Peri-intraventricular hemorrhages
of the 3 degree were found in 27 patients (24,55%).
Conclusions: Thus, neurosonography in the complex
investigation of newborns with hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy appeared to be highly effective reliable
methods of early diagnosis of cerebral pathology which
may be recommended to perform from the 3rd day of
life. This method allows to identify predominantly
changes of hemorrhagic character (peri- and
intraventricular) hemorrhages in the brain of different
severity.
OUTCOME OF INFANTS EXCLUDED FROM A
HYPOTHERMIA TRIAL BY AMPLITUDE-EEG

College, London, UK
Background and Aims: Infants with hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy (HIE) were excluded from a recent
hypothermia trial if an analog aEEG (Lectromed)
tracing failed to meet criteria for moderate-to-severe
abnormality. Expertly interpreted aEEG is predictive of
outcome of HIE; yet, its prognostic utility by novice or
infrequent users is uncertain.
Methods: Cases were ascertained from the recruitment
log from a single study center. 25 infants >=36 wks with
birth depression and moderate-to-severe HIE in the first
5.5h of life were logged over 2 years. 12 were
randomized, 1 was ineligible because of equipment
malfunction, and 12 did not meet aEEG criteria.
Results: Of the 12 excluded infants, 3 were lost to
followup and 1 died neonatally with severe HIE. Of 8
with 3-6 yrs followup; 50% had spastic or athetoid CP,
microcephaly and developmental delay, one had ADHD,
and three were normal.
Conclusions: There was a high burden of death or
severe disability in infants excluded based on criteria
intended to enhance specificity. Possible explanations
include (i) the cause of birth depression and CP might
not have been acute perinatal HI; or (ii) the aEEG step
may have excluded patients that might have benefited. A
limitation of the Lectromed aEEG was inability to
evaluate raw EEG. With new monitors, and raw EEG
review capability, the role of “aEEG” in patient
selection may need to be re-evaluated. We speculate that
the new digital EEG monitors might play a greater role
in enhancing sensitivity of ascertainment of eligible
infants than in excluding candidates from a safe and
effective therapeutic intervention.

Netherlands
Background and Aims: Perinatal asphyxia is one of the
major causes of neonatal death. During hypoxia,
reactive oxygen species are formed by reperfusion and
by resuscitation with 100% oxygen. Reactive oxygen
species cause brain injury and organ failure. Glutathione
(GSH) is the major intracellular antioxidant. It protects
cells against the toxic effects of these reactive oxygen
species. The fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of
glutathione in healthy adults is 65 ± 13%/day [Lyons,
2000]. Our aim is to quantify the FSR of glutathione in
term asphyxiated infants, shortly after birth.
Methods: Neonates with a gestational age > 35 weeks,
umbilical pH < 7.10 and 5 min Apgar score < 7 were
included. To quantify glutathione synthesis, we infused
[1-13C]glycine between 48 and 96 hours after the
hypoxic event. Blood was sampled after 4, 5 and 6
hours. Free [1-13C]glycine enrichment was measured by
gas chromatography - isotope ratio mass spectrometry
(IRMS) and was used as a precursor for glutathione
synthesis. Labelled glycine incorporation in glutathione
was measured by liquid chromatography - IRMS.
Results: The four infants were measured on postnatal
day 3 and reached a plateau within 4 hours. See table.
- 339 -
Conclusions: Neonates (>35 weeks) with asphyxia have
a low FSR of glutathione as compared to healthy adults.

Background and Aims: Hypothermia (HT),
administered after hypoxia-ischaemia (HI) in newborn
infants, is neuroprotective. However, the long-term
efficacy is uncertain and the number to treat is 6.
Experimental models show that the inert gas Xenon
(Xe) protects the brain after HI. Preliminary work
combining the two treatments to enhance
neuroprotection shows great promise. Xe has a high
density and viscosity, and at high concentration (70%)
can cause respiratory depression. Moderate Xe
concentration (50%) does not depress respiration at
normothermia (NT) but the effect of the combination on
respiration in neonates is unknown. Thus, our aim was
to examine the respiratory effects of 50% Xe and HT
after HI in the neonatal rat.
Methods: 29, 7-day-old (P7) Wistar rats underwent
ligation of the left common carotid artery, followed by
90 minutes of hypoxia (8% oxygen) at NT. Pups were
then randomised to receive 5h of: Air/NT, Air/HT, 50%
Xe/NT or 50% Xe/HT. Sampling of blood gases was
performed immediately after the treatment period.
Results: Measured respiratory outcomes (pH, pCO2 and
lactate) and HCO3 were not significantly affected by 5h
of 50% Xenon or HT alone, nor the combination, after
HI. pO2 was significantly higher in the 50% Xe/NT
group than the Air/HT group, apparently reflecting the
variability of this measure in mixed arterial-venous
samples.
Conclusions: The combination of 50% Xenon and
hypothermia for 5 hours following HI does not depress
respiration in the neonatal rat. For further clinical trials
we would suggest that 50% Xenon is a safe and
effective concentration to use in combination with
hypothermia.

Background and Aims: The aim of this study is to
investigate the relationship between serum levels of
S-100 and Tau protein and bilirubin encephalopathy
findings in neonates.
Methods: Sixty one jaundiced and 28 healthy term
newborns were included. Serum levels of S-100 and Tau
protein were analysed by ELISA. Neurological
examination, Electroencephalogram (EEG), otoacustic
emission (OAE), brainstem auditory evoked response
(BAER) were done in infants on admission and at the
age of three months.
Results: Mean serum levels of Tau and S-100 protein
(183.6 9.6 pg/mL, 151.1 18.2 ng/L) in jaundiced infant
was higher than in controls (245.5 64.6 pg/mL,
979.6 986.7 ng/L) (p<0.000, p<0.000) respectively.
There were significant positive correlations between
total bilirubin concentrations and serum Tau protein
(r=0.825, p=0.000) and serum S-100 protein
concentrations (r=0.794, p=0.000). In jaundice group, 8
cases had EEG abnormalities, 9 cases had BAER
abnormalities and 6 cases failed OAE, while no
abnormality were detected in controls. In infants whose
bilirubin levels higher than 20mg/dl, 10 were hypotonic
and 22 had poor sucking on admission, but there are no
clinical abnormalities in jaundiced infants whose
bilirubin levels lower than 20mg/dl. In the age of three
months-old, all previous abnormalities were
disappeared.
Conclusions: Serum Tau and S-100 proteins can be
used as markers of bilirubin induced neurotoxicity in
neonates. Vigintiphobia could be a reality.

University, Medical School, Athens, Greece
Background and Aims: Intrauterine growth restricted
(IUGR) are fetuses with estimated weight <10th
customized centile, displaying signs of chronic
malnutrition and hypoxia, possibly leading to brain
sparing effect. Neurotrophins, [Nerve Growth Factor
(NGF), Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF),
Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), Neurotrophin-4 (NT- 4)] are
important for pre- and postnatal brain development. This
study investigated circulating levels of NGF, BDNF,
NT-3 and NT-4 in IUGR and appropriate for gestational
age (AGA) term fetuses and neonates and their mothers.
Methods: BDNF, NGF, NT-4, NT-3 were determined
by enzyme immunoassays in the plasma of 60 mothers
(MS) and their 30 IUGR and 30 AGA fetuses (UC) and
neonates on postnatal day 1 (N1) and 4 (N4).
- 340 -
Results: No statistically significant differences were
observed between IUGR and AGA MS, UC, N1 and N4
of BDNF, NT-3 and NT-4 levels. NGF levels were
significantly higher in AGA than IUGR MS (p=0.007),
UC (p=0.01), N1 (p=0.043) and N4 (p=0.003) and
positively correlated with the infants’ centiles and
birthweights. IUGR and AGA maternal neurotrophin
levels were higher than respective fetal and neonatal
levels. Neurotrophin levels showed no correlation with
gender or delivery mode in both groups.
Conclusions: The brain sparing effect, caused by fetal
hypoxia, could be responsible for similar BDNF, NT-3
and NT-4 levels in IUGR and AGA fullterm fetuses and
neonates. NGF levels positively correlated with infants’
customized centile and birthweight, thus they were
higher in AGA. Elevated maternal neurotrophin levels
could reflect nervous system maturity. No
differentiation in neurotrophin levels among genders
might imply their similar neurodevelopment.

Background and Aims: We investigated the effect of
hGH on newborn rat brain superoxide dismutase (SOD),
glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels
in hypoxic-ischemic newborn rats.
Methods: Forty-eight 7 days old newborn rats were
randomised to healthy (n:15), hypoxic ischemic (H-I,
n:18) and GH administered hypoxic ischemic (GH-HI,
n:15) group. Permanent, left common carotid ligation
was performed in the hypoxic ischemic groups. In the
GH-HI group, 50 mg/kg s.c. hGH was administered just
before carotid artery ligation. After 2 hours of
hypoxemia rats were decapitated. Right and left cerebral
hemispheres (CHs) and cerebellum-brain stem (C-BS)
were separated.
Results: GSH levels of each region were not
statistically different from each other in and between the
groups. SOD levels were higher in CBSs compared to
CHs (p<0, 01). CHs and C-BS MDA levels were similar
in the control and H-I groups but MDA levels of both
CHs in GH-HI group were significantly higher than the
levels of H-I group. Left CH of GH-HI group was also
higher compared to left CH of the control group (p=0,
045) while there was no difference between right CHs.
In GH-HI group left CH MDA level was higher than C-
BS (p=0,03). MDA levels of the C-BSs did not differ
between groups (p>0, 05).
Conclusions: In conclusion, although we have not
evaluated the effect of GH histopathologically,
increased lipid peroxidation especially in the hypoxic-
ischemic (left) hemisphere of the GH treated rats might
suggest that GH treatment may be harmful in hypoxic
ischemic encephalopathy.
NEONATAL BRAIN INJURY - HYPOXIA PLUS
INFECTION. WHICH IS THE OUTCOME?
M Craiu, A V Cochino, P Avram
Institute for Mother and Child Care, Bucharest,
Romania
Background and Aims: As stated in literature, the
association between hypoxia and infection is a
worsening factor of neonatal brain injury. We performed
a 2 years study, to determine the value of the risk
increment in this concern.
Methods: This is a retrospective case control study. The
data were gathered from clinical files of 2004-2005. The
infected group: 11 newborns with documented infection
and hypoxic/ischemic brain damage. The control group:
27 newborns with perinatal brain damage. We have
evaluated the risk factor distribution, especially the
infection, and the severity of neurologic impairment, as
documented by clinical and transfontanelar echographic
(TFE) evaluation.
Results: No significant Apgar scores differences were
found between the two groups (mean Apgar scores at 1
minute: 5.75 in infected, versus 5.5 in control group).
The mean number of clinical signs of neurologic
impairment was 3.63/patient as compared to
2.44/patient, in the control group. Cerebral edema and
dilated lateral ventriculi, as evaluated by TFE, were
more frequent in the infected group. There were 18.51%
patients with a normal TFE in the control group but
none in the infected group.
Conclusions: 1. Infection presence worsens the clinical
and TFE aspect of newborns with hypoxic brain injury
(clinical and imagistic proves). 2. Other important risk
factors were: birth at home, lack of pregnancy follow-
up, maternal infection during gestation and prolonged
ruptured membranes. 3. Gestation follow-up, economic
development (related to hospital versus home birth) and
infection control might improve neurologic outcome of
newborns.
LEPTIN RECEPTOR EXPRESSION IN THE
BRAIN OF NEWBORN RATS DECREASES
FOLLOWING HYPEROXIA AND INCREASES
AFTER INJURY CAUSED BY PHORBOLESTER
C Peiser, P Koehne, M Dzietko, O Polley, M Obladen,

Department of Neonatology, Charité Virchow-Campus,
Berlin, Germany
Background and Aims: Leptin is a pleitropic
proteohormone and cytokine, which acts by binding at
the long isoform of the leptin receptor (OB-Rb). Next to
metabolic and immunomodulating functions, leptin also
promotes angiogenesis, takes part in brain development,
and plays a role in neuroprotection. The aim of this
study was to investigate OB-Rb expression in the brain
of newborn rats in relation to neurodegeneration, either
induced by hyperoxic or inflammatory brain injury, both
important causes of neonatral neurodegeneration.
Methods: 6 d old Wistar rat pups were either subjected
to 80% oxygen or treated with phorbolester by injecting
500 μg intraperitoneally. After 0, 2, 6, 12 and 24 h of
exposition animals (n = 5 per group) were sacrificed and
- 341 -
the brain cortices were processed for molecular
experiments on mRNA (quantitative RT-PCR) and
protein (Western blot) levels using OB-Rb specific
primers and antibodies.
Results: In association with hyperoxia a decrease in
OB-Rb mRNA and protein expression down to about
40% of the basal level of the control animals was noted.
In case of phorbolester treatment we have seen an
increase of OB-Rb expression up to about 170%
compared to the controls. The effects had their
maximum / minimum after 6-12 h on the transcriptional
and after 24 h on the translational level.
Conclusions: Exposure to hyperoxia or treatment with
phorbolester induce statistically significant time-
dependent changes in OB-Rb expression, indicating the
influence of the leptin system in neuronal injury to the
immature brain caused by hyperoxic or inflammatory
brain injury.

Background and Aims: Cerebral ventriculomegaly at
term equivalent age is an predictor of adverse outcome
in preterms. It can easily be detected with cranial
ultrasound (US), whereas 3D MRI provides a valid
assessment of ventricle volumes. Previous studies have
found limited correlations between 2D ventricular US
measurements and 3D MRI volumes; however CSF
volumes were not subdivided into extracerebral and
ventricular CSF.
Methods: Paired cranial MRI and US scans in a
population based cohort of 43 ELGA infants were
obtained. Infants were scanned at term equivalent age on
a 1.5T MRI system. To segment the lateral ventricles, an
image processing software was developed using a semi-
automatic Active Contour model. Cranial US was
performed in the coronal and parasagittal planes through
the anterior fontanelle. Five different ventricular
dimensions were measured on each side.
Results: Correlations (r2) between MRI volumes of US
measurements of the frontal horns (coronal short axis:
right 0.91, left 0.82, long axis right 0.74, left 0.67;
sagittal frontal horn height right 0.88, left 0.70) and
ventricular midbody (right 0.83, left 0.80) were
consistently good to excellent. Highest correlation was
achieved by combining the coronal frontal horn
measurements to a frontal horn product (=short
axis*long axis; right 0.95, left 0.92). The thalamus-
occipital horn distance showed the poorest correlation
(right 0.53, left 0.37).
Conclusions: We have been able to show that 2D
ultrasound measurements of the frontal horns and
midbody have a very good correlation to the total
ventricular volume measured by MRI. This study
underlines the reliability and value of neonatal cranial
ultrasound.

Hospital, Bristol, UK
Background and Aims: aEEG is an important tool in
the evaluation of neonatal brain activity and prediction
of outcome. Changes in aEEG related to changes in CPP
were studied.
Methods: Five piglets (<24 hours old) were
anaesthetised. Four mls of high hematocrit blood were
injected into the lateral ventricles over two hours (1),
under continuous intracranial pressure (ICP), invasive
mean arterial pressure (MAP) and aEEG monitoring.
Post-injection ultrasonography confirmed the intra-
ventricular location of the injected blood.
Results: The median of the maximal ICP was 25 mmHg
at 80-100 minutes after the commencement of injection.
The median of the lowest CPP was 18 mmHg (range
8 - 40 mmHg) and occurred at the time of maximal ICP.
Maximal drop in aEEG baseline occurred during the
period of lowest CPP in four piglets. Recovery occurred
within 15 minutes of return to baseline CPP (Figure 1).
Conclusions: Reduction in aEEG upper and lower
voltage margin correlates with reduced CPP
in this model 1). aEEG may be useful as a physiological
marker of poor brain perfusion.

THE EFFECT OF INTRAVENTRICULAR
HEMORRHAGE ON SIMULTANEOUSLY
RECORDED TWO-CHANNEL AEEG IN
NEWBORN RAT PUPS
A M Tucker, C E Hobbs, K Aquilina, M Thoresen
Dept of Child Health (CSSB), University of Bristol, UK
Background and Aims: Intraventricular hemorrhage
(IVH) is associated with a high incidence of disability or
mortality, particularly in cases involving
posthaemorrhagic ventricular dilatation
(hydrocephalus). Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG)
allows continuous monitoring of cerebral activity and is
a strong predictor of neurodevelopmental outcome.
Analysis of simultaneously-recorded aEEG during and
after IVH may elucidate the effect of IVH on brain
function, including the occurrence of seizures.
Methods: Using our IVH model (Cherian, 2003), 80-μL
of citrated rat blood was infused into alternate lateral
ventricles of 12, anaesthetized Wistar rat pups on
postnatal day (P) 7 and P8. Continuous, two-channel
aEEG (BRM2, BrainZ Instruments Ltd, NZ) was
recorded from each hemisphere; before (baseline),
during and after the infusion of blood, until the needle
was removed. The aEEG recording was made on both
days of the blood injection (P7 and P8).
Results: During infusion, there was a dramatic
depression in both upper and lower voltage margins and
a shrinking of overall trace bandwidth representing a
nearly isoelectric trace pattern bilaterally. Changes in
aEEG background activity were delayed by 3 minutes
from the beginning of blood infusion. The effect of IVH
on aEEG was more profound on the first day of infusion
than on the second.
Conclusions: This study confirms that IVH has a
significant effect on overall aEEG background activity,
notably upper and lower voltage margins and trace
bandwidth, in the newborn rat.
EFFECT OF CHRONIC FETAL HYPOXIA ON

Department of Neonatology, Maastricht University
Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: The processes of pulmonary
growth and maturation are critical in preparing the fetus
for postnatal life. Previous studies suggest a modulatory
effect of prenatal hypoxia on lung development. We
hypothesise that normal surfactant development is
altered by chronic prenatal hypoxia in the chicken fetus.
Methods: White Leghorn fertilised eggs were incubated
at either room air or 15% hypoxia from day 6 of the 21-
day incubation period. Normoxic and hypoxic chick
embryos were sacrificed at either day 16 (n=15 for each
group) or day 19 (n=15 for each group). Lungs were
excised and total protein was measured in the
homogenate. After butanol extraction, total
phospholipids (PL) and disaturated phospholipids
(DSPL) were measured. Surfactant protein B (SP-B)
was measured by ELISA.
Results: The main results are summarised in the table.
Chronic fetal hypoxia was associated with lower birth
weight. Lung PL and DSPL, mainly derived from
surfactant, were significantly decreased at day 19. Lung
SP-B content was lower after hypoxia, however no
effect was seen after correction for either total protein or
lung weight.
Conclusions: Chronic fetal hypoxia was associated with
a decrease in whole lung surfactant content in the chick
embryo on day 19. Further research is aimed at
investigating the underlying mechanisms and
determining the effect of variation in exposure time and
severity of hypoxia.

Background and Aims: No reliable maternal predictors
of adverse neonatal outcome at ELCS are known to
date.
Methods: The value of maternal pulse oximetry
[perfusion index (PI), pulse rate (PR), and oximetry
(SpO2)] monitoring during the elective cesarean section
(ELCS) in identifying newborns with adverse
respiratory outcome was assessed in a prospective case-
control study. ELCS was sub-divided into 9 phases.
Analysis of pulse oximetry-derived signals, systolic
(sys-BP), diastolic (dia-BP) and differential (diff-BP)
blood pressure were recorded during the ELCS in 44
healthy mothers as a function of neonatal morbidity.
- 343 -
Maternal arterial and newborn cord blood gas analysis
and placental histology were performed.
Results: Significant variations in PI (p<0,0001), PR
(p<0,0001), SpO2 (p<0,0001), sys BP (p<0,001) and dia
BP (p<0,001) were observed. 13.6% of newborns
showed early postnatal complications and increased
illness severity scores (p<0.0001). In 4/6 cases a
subclinical chorioamnionitis was evidenced. Their
mothers showed significantly decreased PI (p<0.0001),
and SpO2 (p<0.0001), increased PR (p<0.0001), with
increased sys-BP (p=0.0039) and diaBP (p=0.0331) as
compared to controls. A maternal PI 2.15 during the
pre-anesthesia phase of the ELCS showed N% 94.9%
sensitivity (95% CI: 82.6-99.2) and 70.2% specificity
(95% CI: 60.4-78.8) in identifying cases from controls
(AUC = 0.881, SE: 0.028; 95% CI: 0.816-0.929; p
<0.0001).
Conclusions: Our findings indicate that a decreased PI
value occurring in the pre-anesthesiology phase of the
ELCS is a maternal predictor of increased neonatal
morbidity, and is significantly related to subclinical
placental inflammatory disease. These observations
suggest the feasibility of a noninvasive pulse-oximeter
prenatal screening of high risk newborns in ELCS.

Background and Aims: Endostatin (ES) is a potent
angiogenesis inhibitor. Angiogenesis is central for the
development of the human lung. The role of ES in the
development of the human lung and connection to
chronic lung disease remains unclear. We set out to
study the role of ES in the developing human lung, and
in acute and chronic lung injury in the preterm infant.
Methods: 9 fetuses, 14 control neonates without
primary lung disease, 14 preterm infants with
respiratory distress syndrome, and 8 infants with
bronchopulmonary dysplasia were included in the
immunohistochemistry study. Tracheal aspirate fluid
samples of intubated very low birth weight infants
during postnatal weeks 1-5 were analyzed with ELISA.
Results: Endothelial cell staining was positive for ES in
all 45 samples. Staining of epithelial cells (cuboidal,
bronchiolar and alveolar) was seen mostly in fetuses as
well as late RDS and BPD cases. Staining in alveolar
macrophages was most abundant in late RDS and BPD
cases. ES was expressed consistently in tracheal aspirate
fluid, being highest during the first postnatal day.
Higher ES concentrations correlated with parameters
reflecting lower lung maturity.
Conclusions: The pattern of pulmonary ES protein
expression in immunohistochemistry and consistent ES
protein appearance in tracheal aspirate fluid in human
preterm infants indicate a role in the physiological
development of the lung. An increase in ES expression
postnatally could indicate a disruption in the normal
development of the lung and contribute to chronic lung
injury.

Background and Aims: ECMO is a lifesaving
intervention, its role on CDH survival is still
controversial. We examined the relationship between
ECMO and its effect on CDH survival in our NICU over
15 years (1991-2005).
Methods: In 15 years, our NICU received 280 patients
with CDH. For evaluation and interpretation of different
management protocols, this period was divided into 3
periods: The unit received 38 patients with CDH (19
ECMO) in 1991-1995, 58 (29) in 1996-2000 and 184
(88) in 2001-2005.
Results: Antenatal Diagnosis was known in 11 cases
(29%) in the first and 133 (72%) in the last period.
Number of patients requiring ECMO decreased during
these periods (55%, 50%, 48%). Concerning the last
hundred patients, rate of ECMO felt to 35%. Survival
after ECMO changed from 34% to 76% to 64%. Overall
mortality in CDH was reduced from 50% to 24% to
20%. Most patients who died in last 5 years didn't get
surgery because of evidence of poor survival according
to selection criteria and management protocol.
Conclusions: ECMO may be used to overwhelm
associated pulmonary hypertension in CDH and seems
to have an impact on improved survival. The study
underlines importance of referral to specialized units to
develop experience and to standardize treatment
algorithms even for patients with poor prognosis.
Although 50% of CDH patients required ECMO during
the different time periods, overall-mortality and
mortality under ECMO was reduced dramatically over
time. Improvement of selection-criteria to estimate
perinatale risk and further outcome analysis is needed to
optimize the use of ECMO in CDH.

Background and Aims: Mutations in the ABCA3 gene
are associated with neonatal and pediatric lung disease.
However, clinical and histological phenotypes vary
widely. Our aim was to identify diagnostic criteria for
ABCA3 deficiency.
Methods: 6 neonates with progressive unexplained
respiratory failure underwent lung biopsy. Standard
staining and immunohistochemestry for SpB, proSpB,
proSpC were performed on formalin-fixed/paraffin-
embedded sections. Electron microscopy was done with
lead citrate/uranyl acetate contrast and after
immunogold staining. ABCA3, SpB and SpC coding
exons were sequenced on PCR-amplified genomic DNA
from patients’ leukocytes; when possible, gene
transcription (mRNA) was measured by real-time RT-
PCR on lung tissue and protein expression by
immunofluorescence on frozen lung sections.
Results: None carried SpB/SpC mutations. Case 1
carried a homozygote frameshift ABCA3 mutation, and
had no ABCA3 expression. Cases 2, 3 and 4 carried
double, bi-allelic heterozygote ABCA3 mutations.
ABCA3 expression was normal on case 2, present but
mislocated on case 3 and markedly decreased on case 4,
where mRNA was also reduced. In case 5, in whom a
single ABCA3 mutation was found, both ABCA3
mRNA and protein were increased; proSpB was normal,
but mature SpB was decreased. In case 6, despite no
ABCA3 mutations could be found and mRNA was
twofold increased, there was a marked decrease in
protein expression. In all patients, lamellar bodies were
smaller than normal, almost completely deficient in
pseudomyelin structures (intracellular surfactant), most
containing a dense core.
Conclusions: Although mutational pattern and
molecular mechanisms are various, including
trancription abortion (1) or decrease (4), translational
(6), trafficking (3) and/or functional (2,5) defects,
ABCA3 is characterized by typical lamellar body
alterations.

Background and Aims: Intrahepatic cholestasis of
pregnancy (ICP) has an incidence ranging from 0.1% to
1.5% of pregnancies in Europe. We recently
demonstrated that ICP is significantly associated with
the occurrence of RDS in the newborn but we failed to
find a direct correlation between maternal or neonatal
BA levels and the RDS occurrence. We looked for a
scoring system able to predict the occurrence of
neonatal RDS in infants from ICP mothers.
Methods: We reviewed our database about 70
pregnancies complicated by ICP from 2000 to 2003 and
we elaborated a risk index which includes factors
significantly related to the RDS occurrence in the
multivariate analysis: exposure time to abnormal
maternal BA levels (ET), maternal BA levels at delivery
and gestational age (GA). RDS risk index = BA ( mol/l)
x ET (days) / GA (days). The risk index was then
prospectively verified in 30 neonates born from ICP
pregnancies in 2004-2005.
Results: ROC analysis showed 9 to be the cut-off value
with the highest sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0.75;
p = 0.004). With a mean RDS incidence of 28% in
newborns from ICP pregnancies, having a positive score
increases this risk to 62% while a negative score
decreases it to 5% in the validation cohort (sensitivity
80%; specificity 87.5%).
Conclusions: Perinatal management of ICP pregnancies
is still questioned because mechanisms of foetal
morbidity are unknown and perinatal complications are
not easily predicted. Our risk index is useful to identify
those infants deserving special nursery surveillance for
RDS occurrence.

Background and Aims: RDS and BPD are
characterized by inflammation, destruction and repair in
the premature lung. We hypothesized that the cord blood
levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10, proinflammatory
IL-12, and the balance between the two cytokines
related to Th1 response and IFN-gamma production
would be useful in predicting the occurrence of RDS
and BPD in premature babies.
Methods: Cord blood samples from 56 premature
infants born at Ewha Womans University Mok Dong
Hospital from January 2003 to June 2005 were studied
after prior parental consent at mid pregnancy. Cord
blood of infants with maternal history of
chorioamnionitis, maternal infections, and major
congenital anomalies were excluded. The cord blood
were stored in -70 and IL-10 and IL-12 levels were
measured with ELISA. A retrospective study of the
medical records was performed for clinical data.
Results: The mean gestational age of the infants was
30.5 ± 2.5 weeks. Thirty- two infants (57.1%) were
diagnosed with RDS and 18 infants (32.1%) were
diagnosed with BPD. Higher IL-10 levels were
demonstrated in the RDS group. (3.03 ± 4.79 pg/ml vs.
1.02 ± 0.90 pg/ml :p<0.05). No significant difference
were found in IL-12 and IL-12/IL-10 ratios in the RDS
and non-RDS group. IL-10, IL-12 and IL-12/IL-10 ratio
did not differ in the BPD and non-BPD group.
Conclusions: High IL-10 levels in premature infants
with RDS suggests that inflammation may be an
important component in the pathogenesis of RDS.
Whereas the pathogenesis of BPD involves more
- 345 -
complicated postnatal factors and cannot be explained
solely via cord blood cytokine levels.

Background and Aims: Plasma brain-type natriuretic
peptide (BNP) is secret by cardiac ventricular myocytes
in response to pressure or volume overload. The aim of
this study was to determine the relationship between the
severity of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and
plasma levels of NT pro-BNP.
Methods: Plasma levels of NT pro-BNP were measured
in premature neonates (< 34 wks gestation), at 24 hours
(day 1), 7, 14 and 21 days of life and in 18 term
neonates without RDS and congenital heart disease at 24
hours of life. Levels of NT pro-BNP were compared
between premature neonates with and without RDS and
term neonates.
Results: 45 premature neonates, F25 / M20, GA 30 (25-
33) wks, BW 1290 (500-2220) g. RDS occurred in 21
(47%) neonates. Comparative analysis revealed a
significant increase in plasma level of NT pro-BNP at
24 hours (p=0,001) and day 7 (p=0,015) of life in
patients with RDS. Plasmatic levels of NT pro-BNP at
24 hours of age were significantly increased in patients
with severe RDS than in patients with mild RDS
(p<0,001) or moderate RDS (p<0,002), after adjustment
for GA and BW.
Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that plasma levels
of NT pro-BNP are directly related to increasing
severity of RDS in neonates, and decrease during the
neonatal period, suggesting a close relation to the
functional impairment of pulmonary hemodynamic
changes associated with RDS.

Background and Aims: The clinical spectrum of
congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung
(CCAML) ranges from severe respiratory distress to
asymptomatic lesions. The objective of this study was to
review our experience with CCAML.
Methods: A retrospective chart review in five tertiary
medical centers in the north of Portugal, between 1999
and 2005.
Results: 15 neonates with CCAML, 9F/6M, BW 3100
(645–3975) g, GA 38 (24–40) wks. Antenatal diagnosis
was performed in 11 (73%) cases, at a median age of 22
(19-30) wks. Spontaneous in utero regression of the
lesion was observed in 2 cases. Antenatal intervention
was performed in 1 fetus (pleurocentesis and
thoracoamniotic shunting) with impending hydrops. The
lesion was right sided in 6 (40%), left sided in 8 (53%)
and bilateral in 1 (7%) case. Six neonates became
symptomatic during the neonatal period (respiratory
distress) and 1 after the neonatal period (spontaneous
pneumothorax). Seven patients underwent thoracotomy
and appropriate excisional surgery. Histological
examination showed definitive features of CCAML
(type I = 4; type II = 1; type III = 2). Two neonates
deceased (a 24 wks GA with a type III CCAML; a 38
wks GA neonate with a type I CCAML). Eight (53%)
patients are asymptomatic and did not undergo surgery.
Conclusions: Antenatally diagnosed CCAML has a
good prognosis in the absence of severe fetal distress;
treatment of asymptomatic CCAML is controversial;
surgery may be advocated because of the low morbidity
and the prevention of late complications, as malignancy.

Background and Aims: Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is
used to treat persistent pulmonary hypertension of
newborn (PPHN). The use of intravenous prostacyclin
(IVP), another pulmonary vasodilatator, is limited
because of systemic hypotensive effects. Our objective
was to investigate the hemodynamic dose-related side
effects of IVP in prenatally diagnosed isolated
congenital diaphragmatic hernia (PDICDH) presenting
PPHN despite iNO.
Methods: Data from 16 consecutive neonates with
PDICDH admitted between December 1999 and
September 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. iNO (20
ppm) was started with mechanical ventilation.
Intravenous prostacyclin was secondary infused in case
of PPHN despite iNO, suspected from pre and
postductal peripheral oxygen saturation difference and
- 346 -
confirmed by US scan. IVP was adapted from the
repeated PPNH evaluation. Systemic hypotension was
treated with dopamine or noradrenaline. IVP doses were
recorded during the rise of doses. Concomitantly, blood
lactate levels, dopamine and noradrenalin doses, hourly
trends in blood pressure and urine output were recorded.
Statistical analysis used ANOVA tests. Results are
presented as median [min-max].
Results: Two babies died at day 1. IVP was started at
2[2-6] nanog/Kg/min and increased to 23[4-41]
nanog/Kg/min at 29[7-34] hours. Nine babies received
vasoconstrictor therapy (dopamine, 15[10-40] ug/kg/min
and/or noradrenalin, 0.10[0.06-0.25] ug/kg/min). Low
urine output was observed during the first hours.
Statistical analysis did not shown any effect of IVP on
MAP or urine output. Low lactate levels (1.8[1.4 ;2.4])
suggest the absence of associated shock.
Conclusions: In our experience, the use of IVP in
PDICDH presenting despite iNO is safe. Hypotension is
frequent but easily controlled with vasoconstrictor
therapy.

Department of Paediatrics, North Middlesex
University Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: The discharge criteria and
weaning protocols of CLD babies going home on
oxygen vary between neonatal units. If pCO2 is raised,
pO2 will be reduced and there will be an increased risk
of desaturation. Infants with CLD at Homerton are
discharged home with oxygen if their pCO2 is >6.0 kPa.
The aim is to inform a hypothesis that monitoring of
capillary pCO2 is an efficient and reliable method to
identify CLD infants who need oxygen at home.
Methods: This is a retrospective study of all infants
discharged on home oxygen from 2000 to 2004. Infants
were followed up at home and capillary blood gases
collected at 1 or 2 monthly intervals at clinic visits.
Results: Results are expressed as median (range). 55
infants born at a gestational age of 26 (23-32) weeks and
birth weight 900 (618-1530) g were discharged on home
oxygen. The pC02 and weight at discharge were 7.2 (5 -
11.4) kPa and 3.3 (2.2-6.1) kg respectively. The length
of hospital stay was 105 (50-222) days. The corrected
gestational age when stopping oxygen therapy
completely was 56 (45-104) weeks. 20 infants (36%)
had 39 hospital admissions with respiratory illnesses in
the year following discharge.
Conclusions: PCO2 is inversely proportional to pO2
(alveolar-air equation). Because measurement of pCO2
is less time consuming than 24 hour saturation
monitoring it confers a potential financial benefit.
Further studies are required to determine how different
methods used in assessing infants’ oxygen requirements
compare in terms of clinical and economic factors.

Background and Aims: Current recommendations for
prophylactic surfactant use for prevention of RDS in
ELBW infants do not include recommendations on
threshold GAThis study aims to determine the impact of
prophylactic versus curative surfactant administration in
a population of inborn ELBW infants at 27 wk GA.
Methods: Bi-centric retrospective study from 2 NICUs
with comparable recruitment, but different surfactant
use policies (prophylactic surfactant <28 wk GA for
centre 1 (C1) and <27 wk GA for centre 2 (C2).),
comparing results for ELBW for 27 wk GA. ELBW for
26 wk and 28 wk GA were included to assess bias due
to inter-hospital variations.
Results: 290 infants were included. Significant
differences between C1 versus C2 include: medical
treatment of PDA (58% vs 31%, p<0.01), post natal
steroids (27% vs 0%, p<0.01), pulmonary haemorrhage
(2% vs 10%, p<0.01), nosocomial septicaemia (8% vs
17%, p<0.05), BPD36wk-free survival (80% vs 57%,
p=0.01) and length of hospital stay (82+/-23 d vs 89+/-
28 d, p<0.05). There was no significant difference in
cerebral ultrasound scan lesions or mortality rates. In the
27wk GA subgroup, intubation rates were comparable
(100% vs 93%, p=0.19), but surfactant use was different
(100% vs 66%, p<0,05). RDS was less severe in C1 at
27wk GA, (but not at 26wk and 28wk GA) (oxygenation
index >10 : 8% vs 24%, p=0,07; HFV as rescue: 6% vs
27%, p<0,02). BPD 36wk-free survival rate was higher
in C1 (83% vs 59%, p<0.05).
Conclusions: Prophylactic surfactant use for 27 wk GA
ELBW does not lead to excessive intubation rates and
might reduce the severity of the initial respiratory
disease.

Background and Aims: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia
(BPD) continues to be one of the most common long-
term complications of preterm birth. BPD is currently
infrequent in infants with birth weight greater than
1200 g or > 30 weeks’ gestation against a reported BPD
- 347 -
prevalence of about 30% among extremely low birth
weight (ELBW) infants, as an increasing number of
them survive. Although a new form is emerging, BPD is
very often preceded by the use of mechanical ventilation
early in life. A very low prevalence of BPD in our
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), commonly using a
minimal handling ventilatory approach, has recently
been reported. The aim of this study was to compare
survival rate and in our ELBW infants population
between two different time periods (period 2: last 42
months vs. period 1: July 1, 1986 -June 30, 2002).
Methods: Frequencies of oxygen-dependency 28 days
(BPD 28-d) and/or oxygen-dependency 36 weeks
postmenstrual age plus oxygen-dependency 28 days
(BPD 36 wk) and survival rates for the selected time
periods were obtained.
Results: Survival rate in the latter period was 80.6%
(50/62) vs. 45% (72/160) of the previous period (p =
0.0007). The frequency of BPD 28-d was 34% (17/50)
as compared to 25% (18/72) (p= 0.3803). Likewise, the
frequency of BPD 36 wk was 8% (4/50) vs. 1/72
(1.38%) (P=0.1577).
Conclusions: These findings strongly suggest that an
increased survival rate among ELBW infants population
does not necessarily negatively reflect on the incidence
of BPD in a NICU commonly using a minimal handling
approach.

Background and Aims: We aimed to study the
correlation between the severity of Respiratory Distress
Syndrome (RDS) and tracheal procalcitonin levels in
premature babies.
Methods: 60 premature babies with RDS with a mean
gestational age of 29,5 1,8 (26-32) weeks and mean
birth weight of 1017,8 168,3 (650-1300) g were
included in the study. Tracheal aspirates were collected
on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28 if the babies were still
on ventilator, and procalcitonin levels were studied.
Results: Procalcitonin levels were highest on day 5 in
all patients. Although there was a positive correlation
between Oxygen index (OI) and alveolar-arterial O2
(AaDO2) levels and procalcitonin; procalcitonin levels
were not statistically different in patients who developed
chronic lung disease.
Conclusions: Correlation between OI/ AaDO2 and
procalcitonin may suggest procalcitonin level
monitorization in babies with RDS.
USE OF SILDENAFIL IN THREE CASES OF
NEONATAL PULMONARY HYPERTENSION

R Astolfi, G Compagnoni
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, 'Carlo Poma' Hospital,
Mantua, Italy
Background and Aims: The neonatal pulmonary
hypertension (PPHN) (1,9% alive births) is
characterized by persistent high pulmonary vascular
resistances. Therapy can be based on the use of selective
vasodilatators like epoprostenol and inhaled nitric oxide
(iNO), expensive, not so easy to use and toxic.
Sildenafil, vasodilatator developed for the treatment of
the erectile dysfunction, has been recently proposed as
alternative or associative therapy, because of its
efficacy, safety, low cost, easiness to use.
Methods: Study show the clinical history of three
newborns (> 33 weeks G.A.) with acute respiratory
distress syndrome (RDS) caused by early onset sepsis
and pulmonary hypertension, efficacy treated with
Sildenafil.
Results: All cases developed RDS. They started with
mechanical conventional ventilation and surfactant
therapy without any improvement. Echocardiography
showed pulmonary hypertension, right-left shunt in the
ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale, for which they start
high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) and
therapy with iNO, without clinical improvement. Then
they started oral Sildenafil (2 mg/Kg/6h) and in the first
hour after, a significant and progressive improvement in
oxygenation, with reduction of AaDO2 was observed.
The therapy was maintained for 36 - 48 h, with definite
resolution.
Conclusions: These cases demonstrate the beneficial
pulmonary vasodilatator effect of sildenafil in PPHN
after the conventional treatment failure outlines the
absence of rebound effect after iNO suspension. Such
preliminary data suggest the opportunity of a
multicentric, randomized trial in order to demonstrate
the real effectiveness and the absence of adverse effects
of the sildenafil in the treatment of the neonatale
pulmonary hypertension.
ORAL SILDENAFIL (VIAGRA) TREATMENT OF
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION IN A PRETERM
NEONATE WITH SEVERE IUGR
K Bohlin, M Bartocci, M Blennow, B Sahlgren
Karolinska Institutet, Division of Pediatrics, Karolinska
University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden
Background and Aims: The phosphodiesterase
inhibitor sildenafil is a selective pulmonary vasodilator
and a promising new treatment option in pulmonary
hypertension. In neonates, sildenafil has mainly been
used for refractory cases in addition to inhaled nitric
oxide (iNO). Placental insufficiency with intrauterine
growth restriction (IUGR) may impair lung
development and sildenafil has experimentally been
shown to promote alveolar growth and lung
angiogenesis.
Methods: We report a case of severe pulmonary
hypertension in a preterm infant with pronounced
IUGR, gestational age 28 weeks, birth weight 450 g.
Results: The patient presented with only mild
respiratory symptoms, but deteriorated on day of life 2
with signs of pulmonary hemorrhage and required
mechanical ventilation for 4 days. Echocardiography at
- 348 -
that time revealed only moderately elevated pulmonary
resistance. Over the first 3 weeks of life, pulmonary
artery pressure increased until reaching supra-systemic
levels of 100 mmHg with signs of right ventricular
failure. Despite the severe pulmonary hypertension, the
infant was not in respiratory failure and iNO treatment
would have required placing the infant on mechanical
ventilation. Inhaled iloprost showed only transient
effect. Hence, oral sildenafil was administered
(4mg/kg/d). There was a rapid treatment response with
decreasing pulmonary artery pressure over the first
week. Treatment was continued for three months and
resulted in a complete recovery and no evidence of
rebound pulmonary hypertension.
Conclusions: Oral sildenafil as single therapy was
effective in a preterm infant with pulmonary
hypertension believed to be mainly due to structural
changes in the pulmonary vessels secondary to extreme
IUGR.
NEONATAL PERSISTENT PULMONARY
HYPERTENSION REFRACTORY TO INHALED
NITRIC OXIDE TREATED WITH MILRINONE:
PRESENTATION OF A CASE

M Stronati
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, IRCCS Policlinico San
Matteo, Pavia, Italy
Background and Aims: Current therapy of persistent
pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)
consists of optimal lung inflation, hemodynamic support
and selective vasodilatation with inhaled nitric oxide
(NO). However, not all infants will respond. Several
animal studies have demonstrated that Milrinone, a
phosphodiesterase III inhibitor routinely used to prevent
post-operative cardiac failure in infants dilates the
pulmonary vessels. We present a case of PPHN treated
with a combination of NO and Milrinone.
Methods: A 38- week-gestation female infant (birth
weight: 3680 g.) was born by elective caesarean section.
Respiratory failure was developed shortly after birth.
Echocardiogram confirmed PPHN: estimated right
ventricle systolic pressure of 64 mmHg and bidirectional
flow through a large PFO and PDA. Fever, neutropenia,
increased C-reactive protein were also developed.
Despite full ventilation she remained hypoxemic and
NO was administered at maximum dose of 26 ppm, but
the initial good response did not last long. Milrinone i.v.
was started at 0,25mcg/kg/min, then increased at
0,75mcg/kg/min. Milrinone and NO were discontinued
8 days later and the infant was extubated.
Results: After Milrinone administration, oxygenation
improved within few hours, she developed systemic
hypotension refractory to dopamine (15 /Kg/min) but
responsive to adrenaline (0,1 mcg/kg/min). Seizures
were developed prior to Milrinone infusion but head
ultrasound does not demonstrate signs of cerebral
hemorrhage.
Conclusions: PPHN was secondary to sepsis and there
was no sustained response to NO. The use of Milrinone
has determinate the complete resolution, suggesting,
according to the recent data in literature, that may be an
adjunctive treatment in the management of PPHN.
CONGENITAL IDIOPATHIC CHYLOTHORAX:
REPORT OF TWO CASES
A Nika, N Iacovidou, S Mouskou,
H Dellagrammaticas
Neonatal Department, Aglaia Kyriakou Childrens
Hospital, Athens, Greece
Background and Aims: Chylothorax is the
accumulation of chyle in the pleural space. The
congenital idiopathic form is rare, being more common
in males.
Methods: Case 1Bilateral chylothorax was diagnosed in
a male fetus and pleuroamniotic tubes were inserted at
31 weeks and maintained until birth at 32+2 weeks
gestation. After birth the pleural effusion resolved on the
left side within 48 hours and the chest tube was
removed. However reappearance of the infusion of
increasing volume on the right side required multiple
insertions of chest tubes. The course was further
complicated by systemic fungal infection requiring
removal of the two drains on the right side both of
which grew Candida albicans. Repeated thoracocenteses
were subsequently performed and a trial of the
somatostatin analogue, ocreotide was finally associated
with successful resolution of the pleural effusion.
Results: Case 2 Fetal hydrops was diagnosed in a male
infant at 32weeks and in utero effusion punction was
performed. Following premature labour the infant was
born by caesarean section at 34 weeks gestation. At
birth bilateral thoracic drains were inserted. He received
parenteral nutrition for 10 days followed by gradual
introduction of an MCT diet. He had an uncomplicated
hospital stay being extubated on day 5 with complete
resolution of the effusions and drain removal on day 10.
Conclusions: We report two cases of congenital
idiopathic chylothorax diagnosed antenatally. Parents
were unrelated and caryotype was normal on both cases.
Postnatal management was conservative and both made
full recovery.
TRACHEAL BRONCHUS SUPPLYING THE
RIGHT AND MIDDLE LOBE: A CASE REPORT
IN A PREMATURE NEONATE
A Nika, N Iacovidou, A Alexaki, H Dellagrammaticas
Neonatal Department, Aglaia Kyriakou Childrens
Hospital, Athens, Greece
Background and Aims: Tracheal bronchus
encompasses a variety of congenital anomalies
diagnosed with increasing frequency as a result of
refinements of diagnosing imaging and endoscopy. It is
a recognized cause of respiratory morbidity in children
and association with other structural airway anomalies,
cardiac defects, Down’s and VACTERL syndrome have
been described. We report an apparently unique case of
Rt tracheal bronchus supplying the whole right upper
and right middle lobe in a premature neonate and its
association with vascular anomalies and dysplastic
changes in the liver.
- 349 -
Methods: His hospital course was complicated by long
term ventilation following persistent Rt lobe atelectasis
and consequently almost massive collapse of the Rt
lung. Bronchoscopy and airway imaging confirmed the
presence of tracheal stenosis and tracheal bronchus. The
infant had a stormy course and died at the age of 4
months.
Results: Autopsy studies revealed an anomalous
bronchus arising at an angle of 90 degrees below the
stenotic trachea and bifurcating in the Rt upper and Rt
middle lobe bronchus. Associated malformations
included vascular anomalies, a VSD and histologic
changes in the liver resembling haepatoblastoma.
Conclusions: Tracheal bronchus can interfere with
routine care of children in NICU and it is important for
neonatologists to consider early the potential for tracheal
bronchus to cause or be associated with pulmonary
problems in complicated cases.

Background and Aims: The rapid development of
neonatal intensive care may widen the performance
differences between centres. We need up-to-date
comparison of outcomes on prematurely born infants
treated in different hospitals. Our aim was to test the
hypothesis that the level of the delivery hospital affects
one-year mortality of very preterm infants in Finland.
Methods: This Medical Birth Register study included
all Finnish delivery hospitals with very preterm births in
2000 through to 2003. There were 2291 infants born
very prematurely (gestational age below 32 weeks or
birth weight 1500 grams or less) in 14 level II (central)
or 5 level III (university) hospitals during the study
period. The main outcome measure was one-year
mortality.
Results: The adjusted total one-year mortality and one-
year mortality of live born infants were increased in
level II hospitals compared to level III hospitals, OR 3.8
(95% CI 2.8 to 5.2) and OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.3 to 3.3),
respectively. The total one-year mortality was increased
in very preterm infants born outside office hours, OR
1.8 (CI 1.3 to 2.3). Theoretically, if all the very preterm
infants would have been born in level III hospitals, 69
out of the 170 infants who died would have survived.
Calculating from the data of live born infants only, 18
out of 45 would have survived.
Conclusions: More efficient centralisation of very
preterm deliveries would increase one-year survival of
very preterm infants in Finland.

Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA
Background and Aims: Under current practices of
selective resuscitation in the United States, most infants
born at 20-24 weeks gestation are not resuscitated.
Recently-issued guidelines on enforcement of federal
laws defining “born-alive” infants may affect physician
resuscitation practices. Under these guidelines,
withholding of “appropriate medical care” could be
construed as a violation of Child Abuse Prevention
Treatment Act or the Emergency Medical Treatment and
Labor Act. We wished to examine the theoretical effects
of enforcement of this federal legislation by comparing
routine resuscitation were this legislation enforced to
current selective resuscitation practices.
Methods: We designed a decision analysis model
comparing current individualized resuscitation practices
to the enforced resuscitating of all potentially-viable
infants (20-24 wks GA) whether born after preterm
delivery (PTD) or elective termination of pregnancy
(TAb). We used a theoretical US-population cohort with
primary outcomes as maternal quality-adjusted life years
(QALYs), numbers of moderately/severely disabled
survivors, and costs.
Results: When all 20-24 wk GA infants are resuscitated,
maternal QALYs fell from 23.76 to 23.71 per woman
for PTD and from 26.11 to 26.06 per woman for TAb.
Costs per pregnancy increased from US$10,562 to
US$21,402 for PTD and from US$1080 to US$1870 for
TAb. In addition, mandated resuscitation would save 49
moderately/severely disabled infants, but only 30
unaffected survivors. These findings were persistently
true with sensitivity analyses.
Conclusions: Enforced resuscitation of all neonates 20-
24 wks GA increases perinatal care costs and worsens
maternal outcomes. Compared to selective
individualized resuscitation, mandated resuscitation of
live-born immature infants would not improve health
care costs nor quality of life.

Background and Aims: NO maintains uterine
quiescence and promotes cervical ripening via cGMP
and cAMP. Suppression of cAMP in amniotic fluid is
associated with fetal distress. The effects of oral and
vaginal indomethacin on NO, cGMP and cAMP were
examined in a rabbit model for preterm birth.
Methods: Pregnant rabbits (n=6/group) were induced
with RU486 prior to administration of oral indomethacin
(OI, 20 mg); oral vehicle (OV); vaginal indomethacin
(VI, 20 mg in cocoa butter); or cocoa butter only
(placebo, VP) once daily for 2 days. Uterus, cervix, fetal
membranes and amniotic fluid were analyzed for NO
metabolites (NOx), cGMP and cAMP levels.
Results: VI delayed delivery >72 hours in 100% of the
rabbits. VI significantly increased NOx levels in the
uterus and fetal membranes (p<0.01 vs VP), cGMP in
the fetal membranes (p<0.01 vs OV and OI), and cAMP
in the amniotic fluid (p<0.05 vs VP). OI increased NOx
in the amniotic fluid (p<0.05 vs OV), cGMP in the
cervix (p<0.05 vs OV), and cAMP in the uterus (p<0.05
vs OV and VI). Conversely, OI suppressed cAMP in the
amniotic fluid (p<0.01 vs. OV and VI).
Conclusions: The effects of VI on NOx, cGMP and
cAMP suggest a mechanism in part, for its tocolytic
effects. Suppression of amniotic fluid cAMP with OI
may represent elevated vasoconstrictor prostaglandins
and fetal distress. We propose that VI is as effective as
oral for prolonging gestation and may be considered as
an alternate method for tocolysis.

Background and Aims: Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate
(DEHP), the most commonly used plasticiser in flexible
polyvinylchloride (PVC) formulations, is a widespread
ubiquitous environmental contaminant. To date, little
information exists on the potential role of exposure to
DEHP and its primary active metabolite, mono-
ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), on early pregnancy
development. The aim of the present study was to
evaluate the concentration in maternal circulation of
DEHP and/or MEHP in women with high risk of
spontaneous miscarriage.
Methods: Three groups of pregnant women were
enrolled: Threatened miscarriage (n=17), complete
miscarriage (n=20) and healthy pregnancy (n=20).
Serum DEHP and MEHP concentrations were measured
by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).
Results: Detectable serum MEHP was found in 95%,
82.3%, and 65% of the samples from miscarriages,
threatened miscarriage and control subjects,
respectively, while serum DEHP was detectable in
100%, 100% and 95%, respectively. Detectable serum
MEHP and DEHP were found in 95%, 82.3% in patients
with miscarriage and threatened miscarriage,
respectively, as compared to 60% of the control
subjects. Patients with miscarriages showed
significantly increased serum MEHP concentrations
(median: 0.445 μg/ml [0.37-0.50], range:0-1.1), as
compared to controls (0.32 μg/ml [0-0.39], range:
0-1.55; p=0.0066), while a non-significant trend was
observed for patients with threatened miscarriage. In the
presence of serum DEHP and MEHP, patients with
miscarriage showed a relative risk of 1.58 folds (95%
C.I.:1.09 -2.29), as compared to the control women. In
contrast, no significant differences were observed for
serum DEHP concentrations.
Conclusions: These findings indicate that human
phthalate exposure is significantly associated with fetal
loss.
LONG-TERM OUTCOME OF VERY LOW BIRTH

Maternal and Perinatal Center, Tokyo Women's
Medical University, Tokyo, Japan
Background and Aims: The long-term outcome of
VLBWI that could be complicated by maternal diabetes
mellitus (DM) is not known. We investigated influence
of maternal DM on the outcome of VLBWI admitted in
TWMU Hospital from 1984 to 2003.
Methods: Mortality and neurological impairment (after
following for more than 18 mo) rates were compared in
singleton VLBWI (BW<1500 g) born to mothers with
DM (IDMs, n=30, 3 with gestational DM) and without
DM (controls, n=421, excluding cases with maternal
complications before pregnancy). Numbers of infants
for long-term follow-up were 18 vs 332 (IDMs vs
controls).
Results: There were no differences between IDMs and
controls in the mean BW (1075 vs 1033 g) or GA (29.8
vs 29.0 wks). SGA rate was slightly higher in IDMs (47
vs 37%). There was no significant difference in long-
term mortality rate (10 vs 8.3%). No significant
difference was found in rates of cerebral palsy (0 vs
11%), visual impairment (0 vs 1.5%), and hearing
impairment (0 vs 1.2%). Mental retardation was found
more often in IDMs, but not significantly (16.7 vs
8.1%). Cognitive tests at 6 and 9 yrs showed lower
tendency in PIQ in IDMs. Overall prevalence
categorized as normal in the follow-up was 67% in
IDMs and 72% in controls.
Conclusions: There was no significant increase in
mortality and major impairment rates in VLBWI born to
DM mothers compared to controls. Since prematurity
seems to affect the outcome of the infants, appropriate
control of diabetic mothers preventing premature
delivery is important.

Neonatology, 'Panait Sarbu' Hospital, Bucharest,
Romania
Background and Aims: To follow the somatic and
neurobehavioral outcome at 2 years of age for children
from pregnancies obtained after in vitro fertilization
(IVF).
Methods: There were formed 2 groups: One from
children born after IVF procedures and one control
group from children born after normal pregnancies, all
born at term. They were followed at 21-24 months by
Bayley Infant Neurodevelopmental Screener (BINS).
There were noted: The total score, the risk group, the
scores obtained at different items, weight and head
circumference. For comparisons between the 2 samples
there was used the Chi Square test (statistically
significant for p< 0.05).
Results: There were 30 children in the IVF group and
30 in the control group. There were no significant
differences regarding birth weight (p<0.24), gestational
age (p,0.97). The BINS scores were all in the low risk
zone in both groups. There was no difference from the
point of view of the weight percentile (IVF/control) 56
(+28.1)/54 (+20.24) (p<0.43), head circumference: 56
(+23.57)/61 (+30.2) (p<0.54). If there are compared in
the IVF sample the singletons with the twins (22/8
cases) there are statistically significant differences
between the 2 groups (singletons/twins) total score:
11,18 (+1.77) /10.5 (+0.5) (p < 0.03605), weight
percentile: 66.36 (+25.69)/27.5 (+2.88) (p< 0.01501),
head circumference percentile 65 (+21.33)/33.75
(+11.87) (p< 0.04990).
Conclusions: The children born at term after IVF are
not different from the other children born at term
regarding the neurobehavioral and somatic
development. In the group of IVF children, the twins
have a greater risk for abnormalities in the BINS score
and somatic growth than the singletons.
HOME OXYGENOTHERAPY IN CHILDREN
WITH BPD: 10 YEARS‘ EXPERIENCE AT
NEONATAL TERTIARY CENTRE IN PLZEN
J Dort, E Dortova
Department of Neonatology, Charles University
Hospital, Plzen, Czech Republic
Background and Aims: To evaluate the contribution of
home oxygenotherapy (OT) to the treatment of infants
with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD occurs
in a significant proportion of very and extremely low
birth weight infants in the Czech Republic as in other
developed countries. OT is an important therapeutic tool
of their treatment.
Methods: A retrospective cohort study of infants with
BPD on home OT. Authors describe the way
oxygenotherapy is conducted at home conditions under
supervision of skilled Neonatologist.
Results: Since 1996 a group of 21 children received
home OT. Mean gestational age was 25.8 wks, mean
birth weight 733 grams, average length of home OT was
173 days. 3 infants died during home OT, 2 of them had
the new form of BPD.
Conclusions: Main advantages of home OT are:
Considerably shorter hospital stay thus eliminating
nosocomial infection risk, psychomotor development
and mother - child bonding is better at home, and costs
are lower. The mobility when using liquid oxygen
container is excellent. No serious complications
occurred.
OUTCOMES IN MODERATELY PREMATURE
INFANTS IN THE NICU
I Rod, T Farstad
Department of Neonatology, Akershus University
Hospital, Nordbyhagen, Norway
Background and Aims: Newborns 30- 34 weeks
gestational age (wGA) make up to 20- 25% of all
admission to NICU. The aim of present study was to
describe the NICU and post discharge course of this
group.
Methods: Hospital based prospective study done by
chart review and post discharge charts from hospital and
outpatient clinic.
Results: During the five years period a cohort of 182
infants born with 30- 34 w GA (2.2% of all inborn) were
identified. 90/182 (49%) were delivered by caesarean
section, 92 (51%) were male, 32 ± 2 wGA (mean± SD),
BW 1761± 410 g. 91% were AGA, 2,7% were SGA and
4,9% were LGA. Four needed resuscitation with
intubations at delivery room. 1/3 were suspected to have
sepsis and treated with antibiotics, 70% needed
phototherapy. 12/182 were surfactant treated, 10%
needed mechanical ventilation and 82/182 (45%) needed
NCPAP support. 1/3 were given oxygen for 6.3± 4.6
days. There was a tendency toward male gender in
association with longer need for ventilatory support.
Four infants had IVH and to had seizures. Length of stay
(LOS) was 33.3 ± 16.3 days however 16 (8.8%) infants
stay longer at NICU than 40 wGA. 54 infants were later
hospitalised.
Conclusions: Moderately premature infants experience
significant morbidity during and after NICU stay.
EARLY HOME SENDING FOR PREMATURES
A Kyhnæ
NICU, Hvidovre Hospital, Hvidovre, Denmark
Background and Aims: At Hvidovre Hospital we are
offering the families the possibility for Early Home
Sending (EHS). This means that the parents can take
their infant home when he/she no longer needs
surveillance, are after 34 GA but still needs feeding
help. It gives the parents opportunity to re-establish a
normal family life with their infant in well known
- 352 -
surroundings. Being at EHS means that the family are at
home with their infant, getting a visit from a NICU
nurse once a week, and goes to the NICU for at control
also once a week.
Methods: The parents are being introduced to the EHS
in the beginning of the admitting to the NICU, and about
2 weeks before expected EHS we start preparing the
parents in going home with their infant. They learn how
to tube feed their infant, and how to place the feeding
tube. Both parents learn first aid to infants. We have a
conversation with the parents regarding their
expectations, plans and practical things.
Results: By offering the parents this opportunity for the
last period of the infants admittance, we strengthen their
development of parents competence, and give them the
opportunity to be with their infant day and night.
Conclusions: The attachment between the parents and
the infant is strengthening. Better possibilities to
establish the lactation. Often the mother gets more milk
to her infant, because she can practice skin to skin the
whole day.
EARLY OXIDATIVE STRESS IN DOWN’S
SYNDROME PREGNANCIES

Department of Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Reproductive
Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy
Background and Aims: Individuals with Down
syndrome (DS) have signs of fetal growth restriction
(FGR) and possible brain damage prior to birth.
Increased oxidative stress (OS) in brains of fetuses with
DS has been proposed on the basis of evidence of
impaired metabolism of oxygen free radicals and
enhanced lipid peroxidation in vitro. We recently
demonstrated that isoprostanes (IPs), a new marker of
free radical-catalyzed lipid peroxidation, are a reliable
marker of early OS in amniotic fluid of pregnancies with
FGR. We test the hypothesis that oxidative stress occurs
early in DS pregnancies.
Methods: Concentrations of IPs were measured by
colorimetric enzyme immunoassay in amniotic fluid
samples from 56 normal (group I), 23 growth restricted
(group II) and 10 DS (group III) fetuses, diagnosed by
karyotype analysis of amniotic cells.
Results: Concentrations of IPs were highest in group III
(595.15; 542.96-631.64 pg/ml, median; 95% CI),
followed by group II (155; 130.57-172.23 pg/ml) and
group I (67; 49.82-98.38; p<0.0001). No overlap of
values was observed between normal and DS gestations.
Concentrations over 400 pg/ml were only found in
pregnancies with DS fetuses.
Conclusions: IP concentrations in amniotic fluid of
pregnancies with DS fetuses was greater than in
pregnancies with FGR. OS occurs even more in
pregnancies with DS fetuses due to an imbalance
between oxidant generation and antioxidant capacity.
We believe that this study will add important
information on the role of OS in the DS. Prenatal
antioxidant therapy, if effective, could represent a
possible therapeutic strategy to improve the quality of
life in the DS population.

Background and Aims: This prospective study
investigated whether the odds of receiving a red blood
cell transfusion in premature infants can be predicted at
birth and for whom of these infants harvesting of cord
blood for autologous transfusion within 30 days after
birth would be worthwhile. Methods: Characteristics
were evaluated from 288 premature infants with a
gestational age between 24 and 36 weeks who were
admitted to our neonatal centre. In 144 (63%) of these
infants cord blood collection was attempted and the
early transfusion needs could be compared with the
amount of cord blood available for transfusion.
Results: Sixty-nine of 114 (61%) inborn infants with a
gestational age of less than 32 weeks received one or
more erythrocyte transfusions. Apgar score at 1 minute
of less than 6 and gestational age of less than 32 weeks
were independently associated with the chance of
receiving a transfusion. In 46% at least 15 ml of cord
blood per kg of birth weight was collected in 41% this
would have been sufficient to cover their early
transfusion needs. Conclusions: The decision to collect
cord blood for postnatal transfusion can be made just
after labour. The collection of cord blood is most
effective and efficient for premature infants between 29
and 31 weeks of gestation. For infants less than 29
weeks of gestation, the technical aspects of umbilical
cord blood collection need improvement. This pilot
study requires a prospective clinical study to evaluate
the proportion of premature infants that can be fully or
substantially supported with autologous cord blood.

Background and Aims: The aim of this pilot study was
to assess red cell volume (RCV) and to correlate RCV
with hematocrit (Hct) in VLBW infants. Evidence
suggests that the current practice of Hct to predict RCV
is not always an accurate measure of available cells for
oxygen delivery to the tissues.
Methods: Eleven Infants (24 - 29.6 weeks gestation,
birth weight 830- 1,250 gm and were transfused
between 7 and 27 days of life) were enrolled in the study
with parental permission. Before and after transfusion,
0.2 mL of blood was withdrawn. Using flow cytometry,
the percentage of red blood cells (RBCs) containing
- 353 -
fetal hemoglobin (HgF) were estimated by staining with
a fluorescent antibody to the gamma chains of HgF after
glutaraldehyde fixation and Triton permeabilization of
the RBCs in the pre- and post-transfusion samples. The
difference between HgF and HgA in the post-transfusion
sample allows for estimates of the pre-transfusion RCV.
Prior validation of this method in preterm infants using
the biotin method showed a correlation of 0.99.
Results: The mean RCV was 21 ±4.3, mL/kg (SD). The
pre-transfusion hematocrit was 30.4 +4.2%. The
correlation between the pre-transfusion Hct and RCV
was 0.7.
Conclusions: Hematocrit appears to overestimate RCV
by 30%. This flow cytometry technique may serve as a
useful method for the estimate of RCV in VLBW
infants.

Pathology, Luton and Dunstable Hospital, Luton, UK
Background and Aims: Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
and sepsis can both present with non-specific signs like
apnea and bradycardia in preterm neonates. Biochemical
markers like B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is known
to have positive correlation with hemodynamically
significant PDA, but debate about the threshold value
continues. Procalcitonin (PCT) and high-sensitive c-
reactive protein (hsCRP) are sensitive markers of sepsis,
but little data on their physiological values exists in
preterms. Our study aims at 1) finding the physiological
range of BNP, hsCRP and PCT during the first 8 weeks
in neonates born at 24-32 weeks gestation and 2)
whether serial measurement of BNP, hsCRP and PCT
can support or exclude the diagnoses of PDA and sepsis
in this group.
Methods: Serial measurement of BNP, hsCRP and PCT
are done weekly for first 8 weeks in preterm neonates of
24-32 weeks gestation. Echocardiography done to
diagnose / follow up PDA. Blood cultures taken as
clinically indicated.
Results: Examples of diagnostic performance (cut-off;
specificity; sensitivity; PPV; NPV; LR(+); LR(-)): BNP
(110 ng/ml: 96%; 56%; 83%; 86%; 14; 0.46); hsCRP
(0.5 mg/L: 56%; 79%; 61%; 80%; 1.8; 2.7); PCT (0.5
ng/ml: 50%; 88%; 80%; 70%; 4.2; 1.8). Further details,
ROC analysis, performance at various concentrations
and analysis of false positive / negative results will be
presented.
Conclusions: BNP, hsCRP and PCT in preterms are
variable. However, serial monitoring of BNP can
confirm persistence or closure of ductus arteriosus. In
preterms hsCRP is a better marker of sepsis than CRP.
Procalcitonin adds little to hsCRP to diagnose sepsis in
this group.
PILOT STUDY USING NIRO-200 TO OBSERVE
TISSUE OXYGENATION INDEX IN THE FIRST
THREE DAYS OF LIFE IN VERY LOW BIRTH
WEIGHT INFANTS
A C Doolan, A R Twomey
National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, Ireland
Background and Aims: Near Infrared Spectroscopy
(NIRO) uses light spectroscopy, to provide us with
information about oxygenation within the tissues (in this
application in the brain). The aims were to measure the
Tissue Oxygenation Index (TOI) of Very Low Birth
Weight babies (VLBW) over the first three days of life
and to determine if the TOI was different in sicker
infants.
Methods: A total of 12 VLBW babies were observed on
Day 1, 2 and 3. These babies were assigned a CRIB
score. The NIRO-200 (Hamamatsu) was used to record
the TOI. The average TOI was calculated for each baby.
The TOI in babies with a CRIB score of 6 and above
was then compared to babies with a CRIB score of 5 and
below.
Results: Of the 12 babies included, 8 were male and 4
were female, with an average gestational age of 29+4
(standard deviation 2.3, CI 1.3) and weight of 1.08kg
(CI 0.16). The average TOI on Day 1, 2 and 3 was
73.07% (CI 3.63), 70.05% (CI 4.45) and 75.94% (4.2)
respectively. Infants with a CRIB score of 5 or below
had a TOI of 76%, 74% and 79% in the first three days
of life, while more unwell infants had a TOI of 67%
(p 0.007), 63% (p 0.01) and 68% (p 0.017).
Conclusions: In this group the TOI remained stable in
the first days of life. However infants who were more
unwell had significantly lower TOI despite no difference
in the oxygen saturations or blood pressure.

Background and Aims: Meconium aspiration
syndrome (MAS), an important cause of respiratory
distress in term newborns, has a complex and not well
defined pathophysiology. We have previously shown
that meconium is a potent activator of the complement
system in vitro. MAS is associated with a systemic
inflammatory response reflected by cytokine production
in vivo in a newborn pig model. We investigated
whether complement contributed to the inflammatory
reaction in MAS and whether CD14-dependent
signalling was involved in meconium-induced cytokine
production.
Methods: Human whole blood and cord blood collected
from different donors were incubated with meconium
for 4 hours in the prescence or abscence of anti-CD14
and/or monoclonal antibodies blocking complement
(anti-factor D and anti-C2). Proinflammatory cytokines
- 354 -
and the terminal complement complex (TCC) were
measured.
Results: Complement inhibition completely blocked
meconium-induced TCC formation whereas anti-CD14
had no effect on TCC. IL-6 and IL-1 beta production
was markedly reduced by CD14 inhibition but only
slightly by blocking complement. TNF alpha production
was markedly inhibited (>50%) by blocking either
complement or CD14. Interestingly, the combined
inhibition of CD14 and complement completely
abolished the production of all three cytokines.
Conclusions: Meconium-induced cytokine production
is mediated by both complement and CD14. Combined
inhibition of these two effector mechanisms may be an
interesting therapeutic approach to reduce the
inflammatory reaction in MAS.

Background and Aims: Microparticles are
procoagulant vesicles shed from an activated platelet
membrane. They provide a catalytic phospolipid surface
for assembly of factors Xa, Va, and Ca+2
(prothrombinase complex), accelerating blood
coagulation. Therefore they play main hemostatic
function. We have tested whether there is or not
activation of blood platelets in healthy term newborns in
umbilical artery expressed by the increase the
percentage of microparticles and whether gender affect
or not?
Methods: 55 healthy term newborns, 25 girls and 30
boys were introduced to this studies. Microparticles was
tested in umbilical artery. Microparticles positively
labelled with CD61 were calculated in flow cytometer.
Results: The percentage of microparticles in healthy
term newborns was 4,32. Our attention has been
directed whether gender affect or not the tested
parameter. In female newborns on resting platelets we
have noted the percentage of microparticles 4,67 and in
male 4,02. One can pay attention for big differences
between minimal and maximal values in both genders.
The percentage of microparticles in adults is 0,76.
Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate 5-fold increase
of the percentage of microparticles in healthy term
newborns in comparison to adults. The activation of
platelets measured as percentage of microparticles is
higher in female newborns than male newborns.

Background and Aims: Poor head growth in the
postnatal period after preterm birth correlates strongly
with minor motor deficits. Abnormal individual head
circumference measurements may indicate neurological
abnormalities or inadequate brain growth. The late
intrauterine and early postnatal periods in human
development are characterised by high growth velocity,
particularly of the brain. To investigate if Occipito-
frontal circumference[OFC] is measured at birth in
Preterm infants (< 33 weeks gestation).
Methods: 50 Preterm infants born less than 33 weeks
gestation and admitted to SCBU from 2004 - 2005 were
studied. Infants transferred from other units were
excluded. Data collected: Gestation, birth weight, if
birth OFC was measured/not, day OFC measured,
ventilated or Cpap used on day 1. Method:
Retrospective analysis of case notes and growth chart.
Results: Mean [s.d] of gestation and birth weight were
29.15 weeks [1.9] and 1319 grams [356.45]
respectively. 14[28%] infants had their birth OFC
measured and 36[72%] did not have their birth OFC
measured. Gestational age [G.A] and birth weight [B.W]
were negatively correlated with OFC measurement day.
[Pearson correlation for [G.A] -0.60, p<0.0001] & B.W:
[ -0.55, p<0.0001]. There is no significant difference in
ventilation [Fisher's exact test p=0.2] or cpap on day 1
[Fisher's exact test, p=0.3] between the babies whose
OFC was and wasn't measured at birth.
Conclusions: OFC measurement is delayed in preterm
and very low birth weight infants. This group needs
- 355 -
monitoring of head growth for future neurodevelopment
monitoring. Every available opportunity needs to be
used for measuring OFC early.

Background and Aims: The Clinical Risk Index for
Babies (CRIB) was derived and validated almost a
decade ago. This analysis describes the predictive ability
of CRIB for in-hospital mortality and morbidity in a
more recent European cohort of very preterm babies
(VPBs).
Methods: The study population consisted of 4,989
VPBs (22-31 wks of gestational age) born in ten
European regions during 2003 and admitted to neonatal
care. Perinatal information, including CRIB variables
and health outcomes until final discharge or death were
collected. 4156 babies had complete data for CRIB
score (83.3% of entire cohort). To evaluate the
performance of CRIB score we chose as neonatal
outcome in-hospital mortality and in-hospital mortality
or morbidity (intraventricular haemorrhage of grade III-
IV and/or periventricular leukomalacia and/or
bronchopulmonary dysplasia). To examine the
discrimination of the CRIB score, we estimated the Area
Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC)
with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).
Results: The median CRIB in the cohort was 2. The
estimated AUROC for in-hospital mortality was 0.87
(95% CIs 0.86-0.88), ranging from 0.77 (95% CIs 0.74-
0.80) for France to 0.93 (95% CIs 0.91-0.96) for Poland.
The estimated AUROC for in-hospital
mortality/morbidity were always lower compared to
estimates for in-hospital mortality (0.81; 95% CIs 0.80-
0.82), ranging from 0.70 (95% CIs 0.67-0.73) for France
to 0.89 (95% CIs 0.85-0.92) for Poland.
Conclusions: The CRIB performed well in all regions
in predicting mortality, but less well for predicting a
composite variable combining mortality and morbidity.
Further analysis should compare the validity of the
CRIB score with other neonatal severity variables.
VERY LOW BIRTH WEIGHT CHILDREN AT
FIVE YEARS OF AGE
C Nascimento, L Mendes, F Torgal, R Gouveia
Department of Child Development, Hospital de Santa
Maria, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal
Background and Aims: To assess psycho-motor
development and neuro-behavioural impairment in very
low birth weight children (VLBW) followed at the Child
Development Department of the University Hospital of
Lisbon.
Methods: The A. analysed 68 clinical records of VLBW
children followed at the Child Development
Department, between January 1992 and June 2000, for
obstetrical and perinatal data. The Griffiths Mental
Developmental Scale was used to assess psycho-motor
development.
Results: Of the 68 cases, 18% had a birth weight below
750 gr, 22% between 750 gr and 1000 gr, 32% between
1000 gr and 1250 gr and 28% between 1250 gr and 1500
gr. Only 4% of children were born at term, and 47% had
a gestational age below 29 weeks. Maternal disease was
found in 28% of cases and obstetrical complications
occurred in 72%. Foetal disease was found in 16% of
cases. The main perinatal problems were: respiratory
distress, septicaemia, high bilirrubin levels, intra-
ventricular haemorrhage and anaemia. At 5 years of age
22% of children had mental retardation. More cases of
mental retardation were found in children with birth
weight below 1000 gr. Most children did not have major
visual or hearing impairment. Cerebral palsy (all forms)
was found in 29% of cases and autism spectrum disorder
in 3%. Hyperactive and inattentive behaviour was found
in 20%.
Conclusions: VLBW children are at a greater risk of
developing psycho-motor and neuro-behavioural
impairment. It is therefore important that they be
followed at a Child Development Clinic, in order to get
appropriate intervention and to improve prognosis.

Background and Aims: To evaluate whether a birth
weight (BW) < 1250 g and/or gestational age (GA) < 30
weeks could provide a safe screening guideline for
identification of all infants at risk for threshold ROP in
the central Netherlands.
Methods: Data of 521 infants admitted between 2000
and 2005 and completely screened for ROP according to
the Dutch national guideline (BW < 1500 g and/or GA
< 32 weeks or preterms treated 3 days with FiO2
0.4) were retrospectively studied. Incidence and severity
of ROP were analysed as well as risk factors for ROP.
Statistics: logistic regression.
Results: Incidence of ROP was 24.9%. Incidence of
ROP stage 1 was 17.5%, ROP stage 2 6.1% and ROP
stage 3, 1.3%. Incidence of infants treated for threshold
ROP was 0.8%. Mean GA of infants with ROP stage 3
was 26.9 ± 0.9 weeks (range 25.6-28.1 weeks), mean
BW 830 ± 214 g (range 580-1270 g). Independent risk
factors for ROP were gestational age, postnatal steroids
and patent ductus arteriosus. Using the guideline of GA
- 356 -
< 30 weeks and/or BW < 1250 g no infants with ROP
stage 3 would have been missed, 21.3% of the infants of
the study group could have been excluded from
screening, 6.7% of the infants with ROP stage 1 would
have been missed.
Conclusions: Although GA is a significant risk factor
for ROP in our study group, the screening guideline for
ROP can be safely lowered to GA < 30 weeks and/or
BW < 1250 g in the central Netherlands.
CARE-ASSISTANTS ON THE NICU
Y Hoekstra, H M Kolenbrander-Buurman
Erasmus MC-Sophia, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Since 2003 we work in our
hospital, the Erasmus MC-Sophia in Rotterdam, on the
implementation of the NIDCAP (Newborn
Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment
Program). This involves a lot of changes in the care of
the infant and the involvement of the parents. The care
will change from task oriented to patient oriented care.
Methods: To reduce the stress of the infant we wanted
to take care with two persons. We prefer to do this with
one of the parents. Our NICU is a large unit with a lot of
very premature and very sick infants. We often work
with less staff. Parents could not always be there
because of different reasons (possibilities to stay at the
bedside, region and culture). Since two years we work in
the Erasmus MC-Sophia with care-assistants. These
people (with different background), have had a special
individual training. During the care they give support to
the baby with containment and consulates the infants.
Also for other tasks they could be asked for.
Results: Giving continue support and containment
during and after the care reduces the stress of the infant.
The baby is more relaxed, has less changes in vital
functions and recovers faster after the care giving.
Conclusions: From our experience we can say that the
care-assistants have a very important task in supporting
the infants, but only when the parents are not able to be
there.
TWIN-TWIN TRANSFUSION SYNDROME: A
REVIEW
J Campos, F Duque, P Lapa, R Henriques
Department of Obstetrics and Neonatology, Coimbra’s
University Hospital, Coimbra, Portugal
Background and Aims: To determine the incidence,
complications, management and outcome of infants with
twin-twin transfusion syndrome over a period of five
years.
Methods: Retrospective review of all infants with twin-
twin transfusion syndrome born in our department
during a period of five years (January 2001 to December
2005). Twin-twin transfusion syndrome was diagnosed
in monochorionic twins if one had olygoamnios and was
pale and the other had hydramnios and was plethoric
with a haemoglobin difference >5g/dl and/or birth
weight differences >15%.
Results: Sixteen (2,75%) of the 582 twin pairs had
twin-twin transfusion syndrome. Decompression
amniocentesis was performed in 4 cases (50%) and 2
(25%) performed laser of the placental anastomosis. Of
the 16 infants, 14 (88%) were girls and 2 (12%) were
boys. Their mean birth weight was 1055g (range 490-
2290) and gestation was 28,8 weeks (range 25-36). The
mean intrapair haemoglobin difference was 7,2 g/dl and
the mean intrapair birth weight difference was 20%.
Seven (44%) infants died in utero (five donors and two
recipients) and the rest nine (56%) were admitted to our
neonatal unit. Of those admitted, 8 had respiratory
distress, 2 had hypotension, 4 had anemia and 5 had
hyperbilirrubinemia. Transfontanelar ultrasound
revealed one intraventricular hemorrhage (III-IV) which
evolution was to hydrocephaly. There was one neonatal
death.
Conclusions: Although the incidence of twin-twin
transfusion syndrome is low (2,75%), it is an important
phenomenon in view of its association with morbidity
and mortality in the affected twins. Prompt recognition
and management of the haemodynamic and
haematological problems of infants with this syndrome
is essential for a better outcome.

Background and Aims: The relationship of maternal
underweight with breastfeeding has been scantily
investigated. The aim of this survey was to examine the
relationship of low versus normal prepregnant body
mass index (BMI) with breastfeeding practices of
healthy infants.
Methods: This prospective observational survey
recruited 1272 mother-infant pairs among births
occurred at the San Paolo Hospital in Milan, Italy.
Infants with birthweight < 2500 g and/or gestational age
<37 weeks, and overweight or obese women (BMI >26
kg/m2 according to the Institute of Medicine) were
excluded. Prepregnant BMI was calculated from self-
reported weight before pregnancy and height measured
at the hospital. Underweight was defined as BMI < 19.8
kg/m2. Women were interviewed via telephone through
12 months postdelivery about breastfeeding.
Breastfeeding was classified according to the World
Health Organization.
Results: The participation rate was 100% and 88.9% at
baseline and after 12 months, respectively. A total of
410 (32.4%) mothers was underweight. Initiation of
breastfeeding was 97%. High vs. low maternal
education level (odds ratio [OR]=1.41), primiparous
status (OR=1.35), caesarian section (OR=0.74), and
birthweight of the infant (£ vs. > 4000 g, OR=1.89)
were associated with low BMI. At multiple analyses, no
significant difference was found between underweight
and normal weight women for initiation or duration of
breastfeeding (mean adjusted difference, 95%
- 357 -
confidence interval [95%CI], 0.4 [-0.1; 0.9] months) or
exclusive breastfeeding (0.1 [-0.1; 0.3] months).
Conclusions: Underweight versus normal weight
mothers of healthy term infants may be not at increased
risk for not initiating or shorter breastfeeding.

Background and Aims: Cohen syndrome is a rare
autosomal recessive disorder, prevalent in the Finnish
and Jewish populations. Mutations in COH 1, a large
gene on chromosome 8 produce a complex phenotype
which evolves with age. The features are a characteristic
facies, non- progressive mental retardation and motor
delay, microcephaly, neutropenia and recurrent minor
infections in the first 6 years of life, long tapering
fingers and toes, prominent central incisors, truncal
obesity from mid childhood, a warm and socialable
personality and a progressive chorioretinal dystrophy
which causes almost total blindness by adulthood. We
report our recent finding of 5 cases from three different
families from the highly consanguineous Irish Traveller
community. We are aware of a sixth case in a UK bases
Irish Traveller child.
Methods: Clinical assessment, molecular genetic
testing, detailed family pedigrees, estimation of
prevalence using Traveller population data from the
2002 Government of Ireland census.
Results: All cases have an identical homozygote
c.4471G>T mutation in the COH 1 gene. We estimate a
minimum prevalence of Cohen syndrome of 8 per 1000
Irish Traveller children in the County Galway region of
the West of Ireland and 0.5 per 1000 in the Republic of
Ireland.
Conclusions: A diagnosis of Cohen Syndrome should
be considered in any child from this population who
presents with developmental delay and microcephaly.
Because the mutation in this ethnic group is now known
molecular confirmation is easy and pre natal testing is
possible.

Background and Aims: Hearing loss (HL) is likely to
be the most common congenital abnormality in humans.
As early detection and intervention is critical to prevent
the adverse consequences of a delayed diagnosis on
speech, language and cognitive development. As 33-
50% of all congenital HLs cannot be detected in a
selective hearing risk, use of universal neonatal hearing
screening (UNHS) programs is expanding. Aims: We
tested the value of an UNHS protocol, based on a
Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAEs)
two-stage strategy.
Methods: TEOAEs (292 DP Echoport OAE Analyzer)
were combined to diagnostic ABR evaluation (Amplaid
MK12) in newborns at high audiologic risk according to
the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing. A total of
18,774 infants were screened (April 1, 1998 - March 27,
2006). Accuracy of the UNHS strategy in predicting
congenital HL was evaluated by Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
Results: Prevalence for all HLs in the neonatal period
was 1.81/1000 l.b. (34/18,774), with bilateral HL in
1.44/1000 l.b. (27/18,774) [low-risk rate: 0.46/1,000 l.b
(8/17,476); high risk infants rate: 14.63/1,000 l.b
(19/1298)]. All HL infants were diagnosed < 3 and
received intervention <6 months' age. ROC curves
results showed 100% sensitivity (95% C.I.: 89.0-100)
and 99.3% specificity (95% C.I.: 99.2-99.4) of the
TEOAEs two-stage strategy in detecting congenital HLs
[area under the ROC curve: 0.997 (95% C.I.: 0.995-
0.997)].
Conclusions: (1) The epidemiology of congenital HLs
widely justifies UNHS; and (2) a two-stage TEOAEs-
based screening for congenital HL is feasible, minimally
invasive and accurate in the early detection of
congenital HL.

Background and Aims: Otitis media with effusion
(OME) has the highest incidence in children younger
than 2 years, and is a leading cause of acquired hearing
loss. Cumulating evidence indicates that histological
chorioamnionitis (HCA) is a often subclinical cause of
preterm birth and neonatal morbidity, linked to a fetal
inflammatory response syndrome. Here, we tested the
hypothesis of an association between OME during the
first year of life and HCA.
Methods: A total of 243, randomly selected, infants
born< 37 weeks’ gestation (gestational age of 31.9 ± 3.3
weeks; birth weight: 1725 ± 660 g) were examined
during the first year of life for the presence of OME
[diagnostic criteria: (1) Type B tympanogram; (2)
ipsilateral absence of transient evoked otoacoustic
emissions responses; and (3) ipsilaterally increased
threshold at auditory brain responses]. Placental
- 358 -
histology was performed for all cases and HCA was
defined as 10 polymorphonuclear leukocytes /field in
10 nonadjacent 400-power fields in membranes and/or
placental chorionic plate.
Results: 17.28% (42/243) prevalence of OME, [15.22%
(37/243)=bilateral OME] and 23.45% (57/243)
prevalence of HCA were observed. OME was detected
at a mean age of 6 ± 3.6 months (range: 1-12) in 85.96%
(49/57) of infants born with HCA vs. 10.21% (19/186)
of those without HCA (p<0.0001). OME was
significantly related to HCA (adjusted O.R.: 56.22, 95%
CI: 25.84-122.33, p<0.0001) and small for gestation
birth (adjusted O.R.: 6.95, 95% CI: 3.09-15.65,
p<0.0001).
Conclusions: HCA is a major risk factor for OME in
preterm infants during the first year of life.

Background and Aims: Due to important etiology of
mortality in neonatal unit is premature birth and its
complication are varied in others society, the present
study was performed in order to determined mortality,
morbidity and length of hospitalization in premature
infants in Shahid Beheshti Hospital in Kashan.
Methods: The records of all premature neonates that
admitted into the Neonatal Unit of the University
Teaching Hospital Shahid Beheshti from October 2001
to October 2002 were retrospectively analyzed in order
to determine the outcome and mortality of premature
new borns.
Results: There were 408 neonates admissions in during
study that 112 of which was premature. Of the 112
enrolled subjects three records was incomplete and
excluded from study. Of 109 children 59 (54.1) were
male and 50 subject (45.9) were female. Mean birth
weight was 1866±391 gr and mean gestational age was
33.6 weeks. Common morbidity was sepsis (80.7%),
neonatal jaundice (49.5%), anemia (52.2%), respiratory
distress syndrome (40.3%), hypocalcaemia (33%) and
hypoglycemia (25.6%), asphyxia (16.5%),
pneumothorax (5.6%), DIC (13.7%), meconium
aspiration (1.8%) and convulsion was (5.5%). The
average length of stay in hospital of the surviving
children was 15.7 days. Mortality in premature birth was
28.4%.
Conclusions: It is inconsiderable that 27.5% of
neonates that admitted in unit neonates are premature
also mortality and morbidity in this children is high.

Background and Aims: Life-threatening extravasation
complications are occasionally associated with
peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs)
placement. Uncommonly, severe complications may
occur even after several days of correct PICC function.
Methods: Illustrative case.
Results: A 630 g premature newborn (25 weeks
gestation) was electively intubated at birth and
underwent HFOV for 2 days due to neonatal RDS. On
the 3rd day of life a 27 G PICC was insterted, with
radiological control. On the 29th day, while on CPAP,
HFOV was reinstituted due to apneic episodes.
Thereafter, an increasing respiratory distress and
hemodynamic compromise rapidly developed. Chest X-
ray revealed a bilateral pleural effusion with increasing
cardiomegaly ; 2DEcho showed a 'swinging heart' with
marked pericardial effusion. The diastolic volume
resulted reduced, thereby impairing LV outflow.
Suddenly, the infant became severely hypotensive and
bradycardic. A rescue emergency pericardiocentesis
[6 mL] avoided the impending cardiogenic shock. A
right chest tube was inserted draining 26 mL of milky
fluid. Recovered pleural and pericardial effusion fluid
analysis was similar to the intravenous fluids given
through PICC. Subsequently, oxygenation markedly
improved and ventilator settings could be greatly
reduced; inotropes were no longer required. Chest X
rays confirmed the lung clearing.
Conclusions: Cardiac tamponade represents an
emergency situation leading to a fatal outcome without
early diagnosis/timely intervention. Pericardial effusion
and cardiac tamponade have been reported in 1-3% of
neonates with PICC (30-50% mortality). The
coexistence of acute pericardial and bilateral pleural
effusions from parenteral fluid extravasation remains a
very uncommon finding.

Background and Aims: The aim of this article is to
present the most common raesons for transport of the
newborns who urgently need to be treated adequately at
the department of the intensive care (NICU). The basic
- 359 -
goal is to identify and reduce the reasons that directly
contributed to it.
Methods: Database of the department of the newborn
infants had been used and analysis of gestation age and
clinical diagnoses of infants vas done. The analysed
material covers period from January 2001 to December
2005.
Results: Three hundred and two newborns (1,65%) out
of 18288 live born infants have been transported during
2001- 2005. One hundred eighty nine of them (62,58%),
have been transported to the Clinic for Children' s
diseases at NICU. The most common diagnosis were:
premature with RDSy 115 (60,85%), aspiration syndrom
29 (15,34%), perinatal asphyxia was diagnosed in 19
(10,05%), 13 (6,88%) showed sings of HIE (hypoxic-
ischemic encephalophaty) and congenital malformation
was diagnosis in13 (6,88%) newborns. Sixty-one
(32,27%) of the newborns were below 33 gestational
ege and 90 (47,62%) were below 37 gestational week
(GW).
Conclusions: These carefully made analyses confirm
that priority for transport to NICU, have those diagnosed
with Praematurus and RDSy, and newborns with
gestation age below 33 GW. On the whole, all these
analyses and results clearly state the idea of urgent
improvement of prenatal protection of the pregnant
women, regular follow up of pregnancy and immediate
transfer to the adequate clinic.

Background and Aims: In most cases acute diarrhoea
will be self-limiting. For children health risks may arise
when diarrhoea lasts longer than 3 days. The purpose of
the present trial was to normalize the stool frequency of
infants and toddlers suffering from acute diarrhoea by
administering the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN)
quicker than with placebo.
Methods: In total, 113 children (aged 2 to 47 months)
with > 3 watery or loose stools in 24 hours were
randomized to either verum (EcN suspension with 10E8
viable EcN per ml, n = 55) or placebo (n = 58) in a
confirmative, double-blind clinical trial. Depending on
the age of patients 1-3 ml per day were administered
orally.
Results: As a reason for the diarrhoea viral infection
was stated in 31%, bacterial infection in 11.5%, and
unspecific infection in the rest of the children. Onset of
the response to treatment (reduction of stool frequency
to 3 watery or loose stools in 24 hours over a period of
at least 2 consecutive days) in the EcN group was more
rapid (median of 2.5 days) than in the placebo group
(median of 4.8 days), a significant difference of 2.3 days
(p = 0.0007, Kaplan-Meier analysis). The number of
patients showing response was significantly higher
(p = 0.0003) in the EcN (94.5%) than in the placebo
group (67.2%).
Conclusions: EcN showed significant superiority
compared to placebo in the treatment of acute diarrhoea
in infants and toddlers. This concerns the time to
response as well as the response rate.
INTESTINAL PARASITIC INFECTIONS AND
ANTHROPOMETRIC INDICATORS OF
CHILDREN GROWTH: A LARGE POPULATION-
BASED SURVEY
J Nematian, A Gholamrezanezhad, E Nematian
Department of Mycology and Parasitology, Faculty of
Medicine, Azad University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran
Background and Aims: School children carry the
heaviest burden of morbidity of intestinal parasitic
infections. There are numerous data suggestive of their
adverse effect on children growth. In the present study,
the association between previously undiagnosed
intestinal parasitic infections and children growth was
assessed cross-sectionally.
Methods: 19213 elementary school children were
selected randomly. The physical growth of these
children was investigated by taking anthropometric
measurements which included body weight and standing
height and Z-scores were calculated using New Anthro
1.02 software (CDC/WHO, 1999). Coproparasitoscopic
examination was also done with three different methods.
The association between intestinal parasitic infection
and growth was analyzed with multivariable models
adjusted for the influence of age and polyparasitism.
Results: The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection
was 18.4%. The prevalence of stunting (3.8% Vs.
2.8%), wasting (22.7% Vs. 20.4%) and also the
combination of stunting-wasting (3.7% Vs. 2.8%) was
significantly higher in those children involved by
parasitic infections as compared with uninfected
children (all P<0.01); Only Giardia lamblia infection
and Enterobius vermicularis infections were
significantly associated with reductions in height for age
(stunting) and weight for height (wasting). There was
not such reduction in infections by Ascaris lumbricodes,
Trichiuris trichiura, Hookworms, Blastocystis hominis,
Hymenolepis nana, and Entamoeba coli.
Conclusions: The data confirmed the high prevalence of
previously undiagnosed intestinal parasitic infections
and highlighted important interactions between nutrition
and parasites. These data strongly support the need for
school health programmes aimed at reducing the
prevalence of infection in schoolchildren (particularly
Giardiasis and Enterobiasis), with potentially beneficial
effects on educational outcomes.

EFFECTS OF NUTRITIONAL AND
PSYCHOSUPPORTIVE INTERVENTIONS ON
THE COURSE OF INFANTILE COLIC – FIRST
RESULTS OF A PROSPECTIVE CLINICAL
STUDY
K Sargsyan, K Burmucic, M Dunitz-Scheer,
A C Hauer
University Hospital for Children and Adolescent Health,
Graz, Austria
Background and Aims: Infantile colic is a syndrome
characterized by paroxysmal and inconsolable crying
without identifiable cause in healthy infant. The aim is
the evaluation of a nutritional (lactose reduced partially
hydrolysed study formula vs. standard formula) and a
psychosupportive intervention in “colicky” babies.
Methods: Inclusion criteria are “Wessels’s” criteria,
exclusion criteria are potential organic causes for a
colicky state. Study infants are randomly assigned to
following groups: 1) Nutritional intervention group
(study formula) 2) Nutritional control group 1 (standard
formula) 3) psychosupportive intervention group (3 x 45
min. psychotherapy) 4) Nutritional plus
psychosupportive intervention group 5) Nutritional
observational group (breastfed babies). Infants of group
3 and 4 are seen by the recruiting paediatrician and the
psychotherapist on 3 occasions (4-6 weeks); those of
group 1, 2, and 5 have only 2 assessment. At recruitment
questionnaires are filled in and videotaping of typical
feeding scene is performed. Pain scales are used to
check continuously colic intensity and quantity.
Results: Our results indicate that infants of groups 1, 3
and 4 had an improved state after 2 weeks.
Their”colicky” state was reduced by 50.3%, 51.1%,
69.5% resp.
Conclusions: We conclude that dietary intervention
study formula should be combined with
psychosupportive intervention to ameliorate the colicky
state in these infants. Higher numbers of patients are
required to confirm our observations so far. This work
was supported by Nutricia Research Foundation.

Background and Aims: The prevalence of celiac
disease among children with type I diabetes mellitus
exceeds the prevalence of the condition in the general
population. To investigate the prevalence of celiac
disease in the large cohort of children and adolescents
with type I diabetes mellitus was the aim of the study.
Methods: 765 children from the Podkarpatian Region
with diabetes type I diagnosed in years 1990-2005 were
enrolled into the study. Prospective serologic screening
was performed in 355 children with diabetes diagnosed
during 5 consecutive years between January 2000 and
December 2005. Among 410 children with diabetes
diagnosed in the period of 10 years - between January
1990 and December 1999, serologic tests for celiac
disease were performed exclusively in children with
clinical symptoms of malabsorption syndrome.
Intestinal biopsy was performed in all children with
positive results of serologic tests.
Results: Celiac disease was diagnosed in 8 out of 355
children (2,25%) screened in the years 2000-2005 and in
3 out of 410 children with diabetes mellitus type I
diagnosed in the years 1990-1999.
Conclusions: The prevalence of celiac disease in
children and adolescents with diabetes type I in south-
eastern Poland is relatively low. Screening for celiac
disease in type I diabetes, although costly, was an
effective method to detect silent form of the disease.

Background and Aims: Gastro-esophageal reflux
(GER) is a recognized complication of congenital
diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), yet its mechanism has not
been clarified. In the first years after CDH repair the
incidence of GER varies from 20-72%. Long term
follow up studies are scarce while most are based on
small numbers of patients. The goal of this study was to
determine the incidence of GER after CDH using a
standardized symptom checklist for increased risk of
GER in CDH survivors and to identify predictive
variables for GER following CDH.
Methods: During a period of 18 years, 70 of 159
patients (44%) with high-risk CDH survived after
surgery. 55 of the 70 survivors (79%) (mean age 12.1
years ± 3.4; range 6-18 years) completed a standardized
questionnaire (C. Manterola, 2002). Patient who had a
score indicating increased risk of GER were referred for
gastroscopy and pH-metry.
Results: GER in the first years after repair was proven
in 23 of 55 patients (42%). Nine of them underwent a
surgical antireflux-procedure within 2 years after CDH
repair. At the time of follow-up 10 of 55 patients (18%)
had symptoms indicating an increased risk of GER. In 5
GER was confirmed. All responded well to proton pump
inhibitors. There were no perinatal or postnatal risk
factors associated with long term GER.
Conclusions: CDH survivors are at risk for (sub-
clinical) GER, although no predictive variables could be
identified. Long-term follow-up for all CDH patients
focusing on GER is justified to prevent adverse
consequences, such as chronic esophagitis and Barrett’s
esophagus.

CELIAC DISEASE IN CHILDREN. ITS
RELATION WITH HEART INVOLVEMENT
P Sciacca, C Mattia, M Spina, G Distefano
Department of Pediatrics, University of Catania,
Catania, Italy
Background and Aims: Coeliac disease (CD), is a
permanent gluten intolerance occurring in genetically
susceptible subjects. Recent report have correlated cases
of dilated cardiomyopathy with CD in adults. For this
reason we started a systematic cardiac evaluation of
children with CD.
Methods: We studied 40 children with CD diagnosis
(TTGa dosing). Medium age 5,35 y; medium weight
15,5 Kg. We performed an echocardiography when CD
diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy and a second
Echo2d 12 months after beginning of gluten free diet
(GFD). Control group was of 20 healthy children.
Results: In the 1 Echo2d we observed 8 (20%) children
with mild heart involvement: slight mitral valve
regurgitation (MVr) in 5; slight aortic valve
regurgitation in 2 ; pulmonary and tricuspid valve
regurgitation in 1 and impaired ejection fraction (EF)
(0,58) in 1. In the 2 Echo2d all valve regurgitations had
regressed except 1 case of MVr. The patient with
impaired EF had significant improvement from 0,58 to
0,78. In these 8 patients medium EF value was of 0,61 ±
0,025 in the 1 examination and 0,72 ± 0,066 after 1 year
of GFD (p<0,001). TTGa medium values passed from
381 ± 45,72 to 15,20 ± 2,62 UI/l.
Conclusions: Our preliminary data show that, as in
adults, children with CD are at risk of reversible heart
involvement. The pathogenetic mechanisms may be
linked to chronic malabsorption or to an associated
autoimmune process. Recently has been demonstrated
an upregulation of transglutaminase II mRNA in rat
models of heart failure.

Background and Aims: The prevalence of liver disease
(LD) associated with cystic fibrosis (CF) is increasing as
the population of patients with CF lives longer, and this
may have a negative prognostic impact. The aim of
study was to analyze the results from screening program
for diagnosis of LD in CF.
Methods: All patients older than 3 years (n=52),
regularly followed at the CF Centre in Skopje were
screening for LD through clinical, biochemical, echo
graphic, and hepatobiliary scintigraphic assessment. LD
was defined by the finding of hepatomegaly and/or
splenomegaly; significant and persistent increased of at
least two serum liver enzyme levels; suggestive
ultrasonographic abnormalities (score >4); and
morphologic or functional scintigraphic abnormalities.
Results: According to our predefined criteria, 18
patients (34.6%) were classified as having LD, three of
them with portal hypertension. Clinical presentations of
LD had 6 (33.3%), abnormal liver blood test results 12
(66.6%), ultrasound abnormalities 18 (100%), and
scintigraphic abnormalities 13 (72.2%) of the patients
with LD. Prevalence of LD increased with age (average
13.2±5.3 years in the LD group vs. 9.9±5.6 years in the
no LD group). A male predominance was found in the
group with LD (72%). Pancreatic insufficiency was
present in all patients with LD. Genetic analysis show
higher frequency of F508 mutation in LD group
(77.8%) vs. no LD group (66.2%). All patients with LD
had severe mutations: F508, G542X, N1303K,
CFTRdel.21Kb, 1811+1G C, and Y1092X.
Conclusions: Hepatic screening enable early
identification of patients with LD and early therapeutic
intervention for prevention of liver complications.

Background and Aims: In adults difficulties in
nutritional support following pentobarbital coma are
repeatedly shown. In contrast no data are available in
children. We determined the tolerance and adequacy of
feeding in children receiving continuous pentobarbital
infusion during pharmacological induced coma in a
retrospective data analysis in 2003-2005.
Methods: Children were eligible for the study if they
received at least 48 hours continuous pentobarbital as
treatment modality for refractory seizures. Desired
intake and the type of formula was guided by a
nutritional protocol and adjusted to the child's condition
by the attending intensivist. Actual energy intake was
recorded, compared to measured energy expenditure
(MEE) in 5 patients and compared with calculated
resting energy expenditure (REE) in 3 patients.
Results: Eight children were eligible. The mean age was
4 years (range 0-13). During 94 pentobarbital coma days
a total of 63 records of feeding days were recorded.
Seven patients were successfully fed on a duodenal tube.
Enteral feeding was given in 87% of the children. The
MEE of the 5 measured children was 25% lower in
comparison to calculated REE.
Conclusions: This study shows that children requiring
continuous pentobarbital during pharmacological coma
tolerated enteral feeding well but have a decreased
energy expenditure and a considerable risk of
overfeeding.

Background and Aims: As birth weight predicts infant
outcome, growth and development, determining the risk
for intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is important
in prenatal care. In this study we aimed to compare the
blood lead levels of maternal-cord pairs, in normal and
IUGR term neonates in Isfahan city.
Methods: From April 2005 to December 2005, blood
lead levels were measured in umbilical cord and
maternal venous blood samples in 32 mother-infant
pairs with IUGR full term neonates and 34 mother-
infant pairs with normal full term neonates. Blood-lead
levels were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry.
Results: The mean lead concentration in neonates of
IUGR and normal groups were not significantly
different (107.47 +/- 16.75 vs. 113.08 +/- 19.08 μg/L,
respectively p=0.2). The mean lead concentration in
mothers of IUGR group was lower than normal groups,
but this difference was not significant (124.56 +/- 19.71
vs.135.26 +/- 26.91 μg/L, respectively, p=0.07).
Maternal lead levels were strongly related with cord
blood in both IUGR and normal groups (r=0.8, and
p<0.0001). Maternal and cord blood lead levels were not
correlated with birth weight of newborns in neither
group. Overall, 65.6% of IUGR neonates and 76.5% of
normal neonates were above the critical level defined
for lead poisoning as > 100 μg/L by the centers for
disease control.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that whole blood lead
was not related to the birth weight; in addition, there
were remarkable lead burdens on both the mothers and
their neonates in this industrial area.

Background and Aims: Cystic fibrosis (CF) associated
hepatobiliary disease include many expressions like:
liver disease (LD), neonatal cholestasis, cholelithiasis,
microgallbladder, common bile duct stenosis. LD is
frecquently associated with severe genotype. The aim of
the study was to evaluate the genotype impact on CF
associated hepatobiliary disease.
Methods: Lot study included patients with typical CF,
n=85 patients (0-18 years old), followed up by clinical
assessment, biochemical markers, ultrasound
examinations and in some cases liver biopsy. All were
genetically tested for the most common 29 CF
mutations.
Results: Hepatobiliary disease was diagnosed in 36
patients (42,35%); in 56 children younger then 10 years,
only 11,76% had liver disease, 2 associated neonatal
cholestasis (F508 homozygous). 30,59% of children
(older than 10 years) had hepatobiliary expression; in 8
children of patients, multilobular cirrhosis was
diagnosed, four of them confirmed by biopsy. Genotype
structure of 85 patients revealed 32 F508 homozygous
genotypes, 22 - F508/X, 5 non - F508/X and 26
unknown (X/X), the frequency of F508 allele being
50,58%. Severe liver disease developed in 7 patients, 4
children with F508 homozygous genotype. Among 32
F508 homozygous genotypes, only 15,29% had a
hepatobiliary expression.
Conclusions: We could not establish a specific
correlation between HD expressions and a certain
mutation. The heterogeneous phenotypes in CF patients
having the same genotype suggest that other
environmental and/or genetic factors are implicated.

Background and Aims: We perform the appendectomy
through a single periumbilical incision. Using a double
channel laparoscope we locate and exteriorize the
appendix and then proceed to remove it in the standard
fashion. We studied this practice to determine if this
technique makes it possible to make use of the
advantages of laparoscopic surgery and of open surgery,
decreasing costs without increasing the rate of
complications.
Methods: The study group was made up of
transumbilical appendectomies (TA) for acute,
uncomplicated appendicitis carried out in 2004 and
2005. The control group consisted of a group of open
appendectomies (OA) performed for acute,
uncomplicated appendicitis in our department in 2002
and 2003. Both study groups were comparable.
Results: We performed a total of 208 TA of which 162
were due to uncomplicated appendicitis. The mean
hospital stay was 2.84 days (versus 4.83 days with OA)
(significant difference). Infectious complications
presented in 4.29% (versus 1.75% in the OA group)
(this difference was not significant). Postoperative pain
and need for analgesia were less in the TA group than in
the OA (difference did not reach significance). The
savings resulting from the transumbilical technique
represents some 90,561.97€ / year compared with the
- 363 -
cost that laparoscopic appendectomy would incur, and
some 42,232.37€ / year versus traditional, open surgery.
Conclusions: Once the learning curve is overcome, we
trust that the percentage of infectious complications will
decline sharply. This technique is highly beneficial
because it improves the postoperative recovery with
unbeatable esthetic results. The decreased costs should
serve to promote its use.

Background and Aims: To determine prognostic
factors associated with isolated intestinal perforation of
the newborn.
Methods: Data of newborns with intestinal perforation,
but without NEC and intestinal malformation, were
collected retrospectively from in-patient medical record
of 2 neonatal units over a 5-year period. Periventricular
white matter damage (WMD) was considered present on
cranial US if cystic periventricular leukomalacia,
echodensities persisting for more than 14d without cyst
formation, periventricular parenchymal hemorrhagic
involvement or ventricular dilatation associated with
transient periventricular echodensities was detected.
Results: Among the 30 infants (mean GA±SD =
29 ± 3.9 wks; birth weight = 1126 ± 571 g) included, 13
(43%) died and WMD was present in 9 cases (31%).
Materno-fetal infection, antenatal use of cortisteroid,
GA, birth weight, pH at birth, postnatal age, positive
blood culture, or CRP at time of intestinal perforation
were not significantly associated with death or WMD. In
contrast, white blood cell (WBC) count was
significantly higher in infants who had WMD (33 ± 18
vs. 9 ± 8 x109/L, p=0.004) and tended to be higher in
infants who died (24 ± 20 vs. 12 ± 12 x109/L, p=0.07).
Infants with a WBC count above 20 x109/L had a
significant risk of death (OR=9; 95%CI =1-63) and
WMD (OR=19; 95%CI =2-170).
Conclusions: WBC count at time of intestinal
perforation is a strong predictor of death or WMD. This
suggests that the cascade of events that lead to adverse
outcomes of newborns with isolated intestinal
perforation is mediated by a profound inflammatory
response.

Background and Aims: To determine if functional
recurrent abdominal pain in pediatric age (RAF), can
predict gastrointestinal or extra digestive functional
disorders.
Methods: Retrospective longitudinal design of cases
and controls. Symptoms-based diagnostic criteria (Roma
II) were used to classify the patients with RAF between
1992-1998. The average time since discharge was 7,76
+ 1,4 years. The control group (matched for age and sex
with the case group) were patients from a primary care
center who didn't have RAF. When former consent was
obtained, we realized a telephone interview that
evaluated the presence of pain, its characteristics,
symptoms associated and repercussion in life quality.
The study was approved by our Ethic Committee.
Statistic comparison with Fischer test.
Results: We studied 116 patients (58 cases/58 controls),
the average of age was 16,2 + 3,16 in both (62%
women). From the RAF patients 25 (43,1%) continued
with abdominal pain (66% women) and 22 (37,9%)
from the control group (77% women) (p>0,05),
although 10/25 in the cases group consider that pain is a
important limitation for their quality of life, and only
3/22 in the control group (p=0,056). Another symptoms
compatible with functional gastrointestinal disorders
were presented in 15/25 cases and 10/22 controls.
Another symptoms were, respectively cases/controls:
migraine 18/8 (p<0,05), constipation 9/11 (p>0,05) and
maladaptative behavioral responses 17/14 (p>0,05).
Conclusions: There is a elevated prevalence of RAF
and other functional disorders in adolescents and young
adults as many cases as controls, although cases patients
with pediatric RAF have more migraine prevalence,
with significance statistics.

Dublin, Ireland
Background and Aims: The diencephalon is the most
rostal part of the brain stem and includes the thalamus,
hypothalamus, pituitary and pineal glands and the
structures surrounding the third ventricle. Lesions
(usually neoplasms) of this region produce a complex of
symptoms and signs thought to be related to
hypothalamic dysfunction although the exact
mechanisms behind the complex phenotype remain
unexplained. This particular form of failure to thrive
occurs in the setting of elevated growth hormone levels.
The condition first came to medical attention at the
annual general meeting of the British Paediatric
Association in 1951 when Russell described the typical
features. In descending order of frequency these are
emaciation, increased alertness, hyperkinesis, vomiting,
euphoria, nystagmus, irritability, hydrocephalous and
optic atrophy. We report a female infant who presented
at 16 months of age with severe generalised lipoatrophy,
- 364 -
constipation, a normal developmental profile and a
subtle rotatory nystagmus which was initially
overlooked.
Methods: Clinical assessment, clinical photographs and
brain imaging at diagnosis and at follow up post
chemotherapy one year later.
Results: The tumor has shrunk, constipation has
resolved. Weight gain is restored and normal
development continues.
Conclusions: Diencephalic syndrome should be
considered as a diagnosis in any child with infancy onset
failure to thrive despite adequate caloric intake and
normal absorptive function of the small bowel and an
inappropriate euphoric mood with or without
neurological signs. Long term survival is possible if
control can be achieved.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 'CHILD
FEEDING' BEHAVIOUR OF MOTHERS AND
F.T.T IN THEIR CHILDREN
A Amini
Department of Pediatrics, Medicine Faculty, Isfahan
University, Isfahan, Iran
Background and Aims: Some children with F.T.T have
no organic diseases and their F.T.T may be due to
mother-infant relationship during child feeding. The
major goal of this study is to find that which elements in
maternal 'child feeding' behaviour could lead to F.T.T.
Methods: To do this study we chose 50 children with
F.T.T and without any organic diseases and 100 healthy
children as control group. All children were between 2-
30 months. The study was done in four health care
centers in Isfahan city. At first, all children had
complete physical examination and evaluation of growth
cards. The behavior and reactions of each mother to her
child's feeding habits was checked by interview with
mothers and a standard questionnaire sheet. The data
was evaluated by Mann-Whitney formula and
calculation of P-values. The P-value<0.05 was accepted
as valuable difference between 2 groups.
Results: The factors that have no relationship with
F.T.T were: age of mothers, educational status of
mothers, preparing special foods for children and having
snack between meals. Effective factors in prevention of
F.T.T were: Doesn't be worry when the child refuses to
eat. Doesn't control the child behavior when he/she
spills the food. oRestarting spoon feeding again and
again, when child refuses to feed with spoon.
Conclusions: Not only amount of food is important in
prevention of F.T.T but also behavior of mother versus
feeding habits of child has important role in prevention
of F.T.T. By knowing this fact and reminding it to
mothers we can decrease incidence of F.T.T in children
without any extra costs.

Background and Aims: Premature babies with
respiratory distress syndrome (RDSy) on continuous
positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy can be feed.
We confirmed relation between wrong nutrition
management steps and premature infant's disturbing
during the CPAP-nasal prongs therapy.
Methods: We analyzed one group of 25 premature
babies from 27 to 31 gestation weeks. All babies were
with respiratory distress syndrome problems and had
non-invasive mechanical support. CPAP-NP type
therapy gives opportunities to feed babies.
Results: The most frequently falls in a baby's feed
preparing and realization are:
The baby is not in a supine position with the head
elevated about 30 degrees.
The baby has a pain by nasal prongs wrong position,
The frequently or out of suction nasal cavities, mouth
and pharynx,
Do not pass an oro/naso-gastric tube and aspirate the
stomach air and other contents,
Do not remove the tube father aspiration,
Do not feed the baby by gravidity but by pressure,
Do not remove the feeding tube the stomach.
Every of this falls produces bay's uncomfortable, an
exiting, a crying and movements. Vomits was presented
in quarter of group. An aspiration was confirmed in 2
babies.
Conclusions: Small changes in nutrition management
produce big problems. So, CPAP-NP advantages
transform to CPAP-NP disadvantages.

Background and Aims: Importance of early detection
of (echography, amniocentosis, genetic counselling and
prenatal therapy and laboratory diagnosis) anomalies of
Git and anomalies of diaphragm - impact onto adequate
treatment and final outcome.
Methods: Prospectus monitoring for four year period
(2001 - 2005) of the frequency of the above mentioned
anomalies at newborn children cured in Neonatology
Center.
Results: Results for the above mentioned period: total
2980 newborn children were under the cure. Total 50%
of those children with the anomalies had joint
anomalies, out of which 25% jeopardized life of patients
and required urgent surgery intervention. According to
our data, 21% out of total number of all anomalies refers
to Git anomalies. Half of those are anorectal anomalies,
congenital anomalies, anomalies of heart and big blood
arteries make 20%, urinary tract anomalies 10%, CNS
anomalies 4%, while remaining 45% refers to other
anomalies (respiratory tract, chromosomopathies, etc).
Esolagus atresia in sample amounts to 5,7%, diaphragm
- 365 -
hernia 0,5%, i.e. 1 in 1000 babies born alive or 1 in
1000 babies born dead. In total sample, prematurus were
1,8 temporarius (hypotrophicus 4,4%).
Conclusions: Survival in the group of children with
diaphragmal hernia is 96%, specifically in the group of
children with highest percentage of prenatally
determined diagnosis. All the children were at
Mechanical ventilation and surgical treatment was made
within 24 hours upon reception.

Background and Aims: Pruritus related to cholestasis,
is a serious and difficult clinical problem to manage, and
when intractable, represents an indication for liver
transplantation. Its etiology is unknown, most
therapeutic modalities are empirical, and none are
universally satisfactory. The Molecular Adsorbents
Recirculating System (MARS) is a novel dialysis
technology which efficiently removes albumin bound
substances (including bile salts), with promising
preliminary results in the management of cholestatic
disease. Our aim was to evaluate the usefulness of
MARS in relieving cholestasis associated resistant
pruritus in a child with Allagile Syndrome.
Methods: A 9 year old boy with Allagile syndrome with
intractable pruritus, associated with a complex
congenital heart disease and moderate renal dysfunction,
was studied. He had received standard and second line
anti-pruritic medication without symptomatic relief,
being send to our institution for evaluation of the
possibility of liver transplantation. In spite of his clinical
condition, liver transplant was contra-indicated and he
was proposed for realization of albumin dialysis
(MARS).
Results: He underwent two sessions of MARS with
seven hours each. The procedure was well tolerated and
resulted in a relief of pruritus as well as in a decline of
plasma bilirubin (from 93 umol/l to 70,5 umol/l).
Despite of the increased serum bile acid levels there was
a change in their plasma profile. After one month, the
child showed sustained improvement of pruritus and a
further decline of bilirubin levels.
Conclusions: In our case, MARS revealed to be a safe
and effective tool in the management of cholestatic
pruritus resistant to conventional therapy.

Background and Aims: Management of neonatal
hydronephrosis is a clinical challenge. In our study we
evaluated the outcome of renal function in small
children with neonatal hydronephrosis after surgically
repair according to indication criteria for surgery.
Methods: Neonatal hydronephrosis was diagnosed in 38
children. In 28 asymptomatic neonates diagnosed by
ultrasound, the indication for surgery was low renal
function at the first diuretic radionuclide renography in
11 patients (Group A), progressive pelvicalyceal
dilatation in 11 (Group B) and progressive decline in
split renal function in 6 (Group C). In another 10
symptomatic neonates or infants, surgery was indicated
because of urosepsis (group D).
Results: The renal function before and after surgery was
28% and 32% in Group A, 47% and 46% in Group B,
40% and 47% in Group C and 48% and 44% in group D,
respectively. A decrease of renal function after surgery
was observed only in two patients from the Group A
(23% to 17% and 24% to 14%). In the Group C, all
patients regained the level of their original renal
function with no irreversible deterioration.
Conclusions: Increase in renal function after surgery is
hardly to be expected in children with primarily
hypofunctional kidney and hydronephrosis. Renal
function was stable in operated children because of
progressive dilatation. Preoperative deterioration of
renal function was reversible in all patients.
Symptomatic patients with urosepsis had normal renal
function before and after surgery.

Background and Aims: Mutations in the NPHS1 gene
encoding nephrin, major protein of slit-diaphragm, are
responsible for the development of an autosomal
recessive nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type
(CNF). Therefore, it raises the question whether the
NPHS1 mutations might play a role in the pathogenesis
of proteinuria in other renal diseases. The aim of our
study was to evaluate the association between G349A,
C881T, G1223A and A3330G NPHS1 mutation and
both the predisposition to mesangial proliferation and
- 366 -
prognosis in children with idiopathic nephrotic
syndrome (INS) with histologic manifestation of diffuse
mesangial hypercellurarity (DMH).
Methods: The study group consisted of 56 children with
DMH and 105 healthy children as controls. The C881T
NPHS1 mutation was investigated using PCR-RFLP
technique. G349A, G1223A and A3330G NPHS1
mutation were investigated using PCR-OLA technique.
Results: No significant difference in genotype
frequency has been observed between both groups. In
addition, no significant differences with respect to
various genotypes in the DMH group were noted for
frequency of primary steroid-resistance as well as for
gender, age of INS onset, INS recurrences, creatinine
and cholesterol concentrations in serum, frequency of
increased systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure.
Conclusions: The results of our preliminary study
suggest the lack of association between the G349A,
C881T, G1223A and A3330G NPHS1 mutation and
both the predisposition to DMH and prognosis in Polish
INS children with histologic manifestation of diffuse
mesangial hypercellularity.

Background and Aims: The identification of Urinary
Tract Infection (UTI) in the emergency department
which leads to early diagnosis and adequate treatment is
imperative for the prevention of chronic renal damage.
Our aim was to describe the laboratory and clinical
features of urinary tract infections in childhood in an
emergency department.
Methods: By reviewing medical charts for patients
admitted to the pediatric emergency department of our
hospital between January 2004 and December 2005, we
identified and enrolled patients 14 years of age or less in
which defended UTI that was confirmed by positive
urine culture.
Results: 336 patients ranging from 4 weeks to 14 years
of age (2-13years on the average) made up our sample.
Urine colony count and culture were done on the
suspected cases. UTI was 1.38 times more frequent in
girls. 33.03% of children with UTI were hospitalized.
21.7% of the patients were found in urinalysis to have 5
white blood cells or fewer per high power field and
12.3% had positive nitrite reaction. Escherichia coli was
the most common organism isolated (78.0%), followed
by Klebsiella (11.8%), Proteus (6.1%), Staphylococcus
(3.1%) and Pseudomonas (1%). The most common
clinical presentations were fever (87%), abdominal or
suprapubic pain (22%), dysuria (14%), failure to thrive
(13%), malodorous urine or hematuria (8%), febrile
convulsions (4.5%). 92% of the patients did not have
another potential source for their fever.
Conclusions: UTI is prevalent in young children,
particularly females, without a definite source of fever.
Specific clinical signs and symptoms of UTI are
uncommon. Therefore, a UTI should be considered in
all children with a fever in whom other sources have
been excluded. Urinalysis provides presumptive
evidence of infection, whereas urine culture is
definitive.

Background and Aims: To document maturational
changes of in vivo CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activity in the
first months of life.
Methods: The relative contribution of tramadol,
O-demethyl tramadol (M1, CYP2D6) and N-demethyl
tramadol (M2, CYP3A4) to overall renal tramadol
elimination was calculated during continuous
intravenous administration of tramadol. The [log M/M1
/ log M/M2] ratio was calculated to compare CYP2D6
versus CYP3A4 ontogeny and correlations with the
postmenstrual age were investigated.
Results: Of the total amount tramadol administered,
34.5% (SD 6.1) was retrieved in the urine as parent
compound or metabolite in 25 neonates and young
infants (PMA 25-53 weeks). This retrieval primarily
consisted of tramadol 79% (SD 18), M1 contributed
10% (SD 17) and M2 3% (SD 3.4). The mean [log
M/M1 / log M/M2] ratio was 0.65 (SD 0.54) and a
significant inverse correlation between [log M/M1 / log
M/M2] ratio and PMA (r2 = - 0.26, 95% CI for
r = - 0.76 to – 0.13) was observed.
Conclusions: PMA is the most important variable
observed in the maturational changes of both in vivo
CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activity [1] Compared to
developmental changes in CYP2D6 activity, CYP3A4
activity is relatively delayed in the first months of life
[2]. However, the overall weak correlations reflect that
PMA only in part explains the interindividual variability
observed. [1] Allegaert K et al. Eur J Clin Pharmacol

Background and Aims: Urinary infections are frequent
problem in the pediatric practice. During every unclear
febrile condition we should consider the possibility of a
urinary infection. Aim: On time diagnosing and
- 367 -
treatment of the urinary infections for on time
prevention of damaging the kidney function.
Methods: Processed data of 630 children age 0-18 years
in a period of 2 years. Analytical and descriptive
methods were used.
Results: Urinoculture is taken from 259 children and 74
children were positive. Echerichia coli was found in 34
children (45,94%), E.Coli haemolytica with 15 children
(20,7%), Proteus mirabilis is isolated with 11 children
(14,8%) and in some cases Klebsiela and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa were isolated. Recidivicious infections were
found with 17 children (22,9%), out of which 3 children
were diagnosed with VUR. The children were treated
with Cefixime, Amoxiciline+Clavulonic acid and
Trimetoprim+ Sulfonamid depending from the
antibiogram. With all the children we reached
negativization of the urinocultures and the lab results
while the children with VUR are under regular
nephrologic control of the pediatric clinics.
Conclusions: 1. Every febrile condition deserves
routine analyses of the urine, with on time diagnosing.
2. Every on time diagnosing and treatment successfully
prevent the kidney damage.

Background and Aims: The role of acute peritoneal
dialysis (APD) in the treatment of critically ill children
was assessed.
Methods: The records of children in whom APD was
performed because of acute renal failure (ARF) in our
PICU from 1997 to 2003 period were reviewed.
Results: Of 42 APD treated children, 10 had known
preexisting renal disease, and 32 did not. Causes of ARF
in 32 children without known preexisting renal disease
included open-heart surgery for congenital heart disease
repair (12 children), hemolytic-uremic syndrome (3
children), newborn sepsis with consequent MOSF (12
neonates), and miscellaneous (5 patients). Mean age of
32 children without known underlying renal disease was
30.91 ± 39.353 months (range 9 hours to 150 mo), and
mean body weight (BW) was 12,272 ± 12.075kg (range
from 1.97 to 55 kg). Mean age of 10 children with
known renal disease was 110 ± 52.398 months (range 24
to 192 mo), and mean BW was 23.25 ± 13.875 kg
(range 8 to 56 kg). Total mortality rate was 45.23% (19
of 42 children died), but all children with previously
known renal disease and all children with HUS
survived.
Conclusions: PD remains a suitable modality choice for
the treatment of children with ARF in the era of
continuous renal replacement therapies, mainly in the
youngest infants. Further studies are needed to better
define the role of each modality in the pediatric ARF
management.

Background and Aims: There is growing evidence that
urinary tract malformation (UTM) have genetic basis.
The aim of this study was to evaluate prevalence of
UTM in families of index children with established
diagnosis of UTM.
Methods: One hundred and nineteen families agreed to
participate in this study. The diagnosis of UTM in index
patients was established with ultrasound, radionuclide
and X-ray studies. Available family relatives were
investigated non-invasively with ultrasound scanning. If
serious abnormality was detected by US, they were
referred to their physician for further work up.
Results: There were 300 relatives (111 mothers, 103
fathers, 38 male siblings and 48 female siblings). In 42
families at least one relative was found to have UTM
(35.3%). Among 300 relatives there were 50 with UTM
(16.7%). The prevalence of UTM in parents [35 out of
214 (16.3%)] did not statistically differ from that in
siblings [15 out of 86 (17.4%)], P>0.05. The most
common UTM's among family relatives were: duplex
anomalies, simple cysts and hypoplastic kidneys. One
parent had terminal uremia. Serious UTM in relatives
were considered if there was need for
surgical/conservative treatment or strict follow up (16
out of 50).
Conclusions: Ultrasound scanning is useful non-
invasive screening tool for detection of UTM among
family relatives of index children with diagnosed UTM.
The true prevalence of UTM in relatives is most likely
higher than 16.7% since invasive studies were not
performed due to ethical limitations.

Background and Aims: Assessment of renal function
by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is essential in the
evaluation of the critically ill pediatric patient. The
objectives of this study were: to compare plasma
Cystatin C (CysC), Schwartz´s Formula (CcrFS) and
Creatinine clearance (Ccr24) for the estimation of GFR
- 368 -
and to asses the efficacy of CysC in quantifying
significant changes in renal function.
Methods: Prospective observational study in 64
consecutive children admitted to the pediatric intensive
care unit (PICU) after cardiac surgery. Cr, CysC, and
24h urinary creatinine were determined on the second
and fourth day after admission. Cr was measured by
Jaffé´s method and CysC by an automated
inmunonephelometric assay (Dade Behring). GFR was
estimated by Schwartz´s formula, by Ccr24 and by a
equation based on CysC: (FGcysc=4.32+80.35/CysC).
Diuresis, furosemide administration or necessity of
continuous hemofiltration (HF) were also recorded.
Renal impairment was defined as 50% decrease in GFR
assessed by CcrFS. Correlation between different
methods was evaluated by Spearman rank correlation
and sensitivity by ROC curve analysis.
Results: FGcysc was significantly correlated with CcrFs
(r=0.82) and CCr24 (r=0.77). CysC (AUC=0.90)
showed similar sensitivity to CCrFS (AUC=0.84) and to
CCr24 (0.84) in the detection of a decrease of GFR
>50%. But CysC (AUC=0.90) sensitivity to predict the
necessity of HF was better than the exhibited by CCr24
(AUC=0.75) and CCrFs (AUC=0.70).
Conclusions: CysC and FGcysc are closely correlated
with GFR estimated by both CCrFS and CCr24 in
critically ill patients. CysC proved to be a sensitive and
specific biomarker to detect renal dysfunction after
cardiac surgery.

Medicine, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK
Background and Aims: We report of a fifteen year old
patient with developmental delay, auto-selective
vegetarian diet and seizures in his past history who was
admitted with the diagnosis of status epilepticus.
Subsequently he was diagnosed to have
hyperammonaemic encephalopathy due to an urea cycle
defect.
Methods: A 15 year old boy was referred due to
progressive lethargy and prolonged seizures after having
been pyrexial for one week. He was treated with
anticonvulsants and started on antimicrobial treatment
for meningitis cover. His CT Head showed no
abnormalities. His past medical history revealed global
development delay and seizures. He had a dairy and egg
allergy diagnosed and is currently living on an auto-
selective vegetarian diet.
Results: 24 hours after stopping sedation the patient
remained comatosed with abnormal posturing and
abnormal tone. An EEG showed severe non-specific
encephalopathy. A metabolic screen revealed a
hyperammonaemia which together with his history of
protein avoidance and developmental delay suggested a
urea cycle defect. Treatment consisted of
haemofiltration, nitrogen scavengers and arginine
supplementation. Neurologically the patient improved to
a pre-admission mental state within the next week.
Plasma amino acids showed elevated citrulline and
argininoaccinic acid which prompted the diagnosis of
argininosuccinic aciduria. This diagnosis was confirmed
by enzyme analysis.
Conclusions: Metabolic disorders should be included in
the diffential diagnosis of encephalopathic patients
regardless of the patient's age. This case demonstrates
how important a good history is, as this patient showed
multiple signs and symptoms indicating a urea cycle
defect. Early recognition and treatment might have
avoided neurological handicap.

Background and Aims: Metastatic calcification (MC)
(or calcific uremic arteriolopathy) is the most common
extra-osseous calcification in end stage renal disease.
Ulceration and necrosis of involved areas may carry a
high mortality rate. MC has been rarely described as a
complication of short-term acute renal failure and the
therapeutic role of sodium thiosulfate has been seldom
reported.
Methods: A 10-month-old male developed acute renal
failure due to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and
needed acute peritoneal dialysis, using regular Ca (3.5
meq/L) dialysate. Intravenous Ca was given for
hypocalcemia and depressed myocardial function. High
serum Ca P products values (> 70 mg2/dl2) were
controlled with diet, enteral calcium salts and 1- -(OH)
D3.
Results: On hospital day 10, a painful and swollen left
arm was found. Radiographies and bone scan revealed
diffuse calcification and MDP uptake in the muscles
around the humerus and axilla. Dialysis solution was
switched to low-calcium and later stopped, as well as
enteral calcium salts. Intravenous sodium thiosulfate
(100 mg/kg/day) was given for 12 days. Improvement in
arm movement and resolution of local pain were seen
after 6 weeks. X- ray and bone scan revealed resolution
of MC.
Conclusions: MC, a known complication of prolonged
ESRD, is herein described for the first time in the setup
of acute renal failure. Sodium thiosulfate (in addition to
the withdrawal of enteral calcium and vitamin D) was
associated with the resolution of MC. The exact duration
of this treatment in acute renal failure is unclear.

Background and Aims: Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome
(HUS) is the most common cause of acute renal failure
(ARF) in young children. Anuric post-diarrhea HUS has
a good outcome when treated aggressively i.e. with
conventional renal replacement therapy (RRT).
Continuous Veno-Venous HemoDiaFiltration
(CVVHDF) is an alternative RRT to peritoneal dialysis
and we describe 3 cases treated successfully with
CVVHDF.
Methods: Cases series.
Results: At 11 months, 2½ years and 4 ½ years children
have been admitted in our pediatric intensive care unit
with typical sporadic post-diarrhea HUS. All three
developed, 5 to 15 days after an acute gastro-enteritis,
an ARF with moderate hypertension, uremia, hemolytic
anemia with schizocytosis, thrombopenia and anuria
despite medical treatment (normal saline loading and
RBC transfusion, with continuous IV diuretic therapy).
We didn't find any causal microbial agent for these
patients. All three benefited of CVVHDF by a double
lumen catheter with heparin anticoagulation despite of
low platelets account. Hypertension, fluid overload and
metabolic disorders were corrected in the first 24 hours,
for a mean duration of CRRT of 53 hours, without any
complication. All three patients recuperated a normal
renal function without hypertension and one had a
residual proteinuria.
Conclusions: Continuous veno-venous hemo-
diafiltration is a safe technique for renal replacement
therapy in post-diarrhea acquired microangiopathy. We
prefer CVVHDF to peritoneal dialysis because it is a
more effective therapy for the management of
hydroelectrolytic balance and for the optimal control of
intakes (total fluids, proteins and calories).
DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF URINARY
TRACT INFECTION (UTI) IN OUR MEDIUM
DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE
I Ledesma, L M Rodríguez, S Lapeña, B Herrero,
M C De Fuentes, M T Fernández, R Álvarez
Servicio de Pediatria, Hospital de León, León, Spain
Background and Aims: To know the frequency with
which UTI is diagnosed in our medium during the first
year of life, the method used for its diagnosis and the
treatment and imaging studies recommended.
Methods: The parents of 472 children born in our
hospital were surveyed to find out whether the children
had been diagnosed with UTI in their first year. If the
answer was positive, they were questioned about the age
of the child at diagnosis, the use of uroculture, the
method to collect urine samples, whether they needed to
be hospitalized and the form of treatment, and what
imaging studies were practiced.
Results: 24 children had been diagnosed with UTI
during their first year. 5 of those had been diagnosed
during their first month. All had been diagnosed through
uroculture and the method used to collect urine samples
was transurethral catheterization in 15 cases and
collecting bag in the remaining. 16 children were
hospitalized and the treatment was exclusively oral in 9
cases. Ultrasonography was used with 23 of the 24
patients, and cystourethrography wasn’t performed in
1/3 of the children. Scintigraphy was carried out in 18 of
the 24 cases.
Conclusions: There’s a very high incidence of UTI in
our medium during the first year. However, in more than
a third of the cases, the diagnosis is not reached through
reliable samples. The percentage of children
hospitalized and with parenteral treatment is high,
although, 1/3 of the patients didn’t undergo some of the
studies recommended for infants with UTI.

Barcelona, Spain
Background and Aims: Ornithine transcarbamylase
(OTC) deficiency, is a chronic X-linked disease with
hyperammonemic outbreaks featuring seizures and
encephalopathy.
Methods: Four female cases are reported herein.
Results: 1. A full-term female with hyperammonemic
coma (580 micromol/L) requiring peritoneal dialysis.
Several outbreaks with common infections despite early
treatment. At 16-year-old, she was admitted because of
generalized seizure with moderate hyperammonemia.
Nowadays, she is 18-year-old and she has important
mental retardation. 2. A 23-month-old child with Reye-
like syndrome (ammonia: 300 micromol/L) requiring K
vitamin. Increased levels of urine orotic, glutammine
and alanine. Clinical improvement with citruline,
sodium benzoate, carnitine and hypoproteic diet. Acute
relapses occurred during upper airway infections. After
eleven years follow-up, she shows moderate mental
retardation and behavioral problems. 3. A 3-year-old girl
with hyperammonemic coma (568 micromol/L).
Previous history of restlessness, hypotonia and monthly
vomiting since 18 months. Plasmatic levels of glutamine
and urine orotate were increased. Hyperammonemic
outbursts during upper airway infections occurred until
she underwent tonsilectomy. Since then she has held a
normal mental development and good schooling. 4. A 3-
year-old infant was admitted because of vomiting,
headache, ataxy and lethargy. Hyperammonemia of 539
micromol/L. Increased ammonia and urine orotate after
protein overload. Relapses occurred during catabolic
illnesses. Nowadays her IQ is on the lower level of the
normal range.
Conclusions: OTC deficiency usually has a more
benign course in women. Diagnosis and early treatment
with limited protein intake and ammonia removers
(phenilbutirate, sodium benzoate), along with a strict
follow-up, imply an increase of the survival.
Nevertheless, eventual relapses can limit
neuropsychological development.

Department of Pediatrics, Ali Ebne Abitaleb Hospital,
Zahedan Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran
Background and Aims: Urinary tract infection is one
of the most common and most important of infection
complaints in children. Idiopathic hypercalciuria is a
common metabolic abnormality in children of all ages.
There is evidence of an association of idiopathic
hypercalciuria with nephrolithiasis hematuria and
osteoporosis. Hypercalciuria is believed to be the cause
of variety of urinary tract complaints in children such as
UTI. The aim of this study to evaluate the Zahedan.
Prevalence of hypercalciuria in children with UTI in
children hospital in Iran.
Methods: We studied seventy children (3 month - 15
years) with urinary tract infection one month after
recovery and negative urine Culture and compared with
control group (normal children) without UTI in the same
range of age for hypercalciuria.
Results: In 70 patients with urinary tract (F/M=1)
34.2% had idiopathic hypercalciuria and in control
group (48.5% female-51.9% male) 14.2% had
hypercalciuria. Idiopathic hypercalciuria were the most
common in 1- 5 years old group and females. The
patients with hypercalciuria often had recurrent UTI and
upper urinary tract infection.
Conclusions: We conclude that hypercalciuria may be
important contributing factor in urinary tract infection
and almost often it ameliorate after treatment. The
severe inflammation of the kidney may explain this
complication ca oxalate crystals may damage uroepithial
and it suspiteble the patient for urinary tract infection.

Background and Aims: Vesicoureteral reflux is a
common anomaly in children with urinary tract
infection. The presence of reflux, especially high grade
reflux, is the most important risk of definitive renal
scarring. Controversy remains if now days, with the
routine use of prenatal echography, renal ultrasound has
additional diagnostic value in the study of
uncomplicated urinary tract infection. We analysed
clinical, biochemical and imaging parameters associated
with vesicoureteral reflux to determine the adjusted
value of renal ultrasound.
Methods: Prospective study of 383 infants with first
episode of febrile ITU. There were analysed as predictor
variables of vesicoureteral reflux: Age, sex, days of
fever after therapy, leucocytosis (>15000), CRP (> 20
mg/l), and ultrasonography. Variables that result
significant in univariate analysis with p <0,15 were
introduced in a logistic regression. Adjusted OR of
significant variables with p <0,1 were used in a Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve Analysis
Results: None had obstructive uropathy. In univariant
analysis only age more than a year, days of fever after
therapy and abnormal ultrasound were significantly
associated with vecoureteral reflux, p <0,01, p 0,001 and
p<0,001 respectively. In the logistic regression all of
them continued significant, adjusted OR (CI 95%) 1,78
(1,04-3,04), 1,72 (1,06-2,83) and 3,23 (1,9-5,47). Area
under curve was 0,693 (0,634-0,753). The model was
poorly predictive: Sensitivity 26%, specificity 91%,
LR+ 3,02, LR- 0,81, probability post positive test 53%
and probability post negative test 28%.
Conclusions: Predictive value for vesicoureteral reflux
of clinical variables and renal ultrasound are low,
cystouretrography is obligatory in the study of a infant
with first urinary tract infection.

Background and Aims: Ureteropelvic junction
obstruction is the most common urinary tract obstruction
in children. The aim of the present study was to evaluate
the renal function before and after Anderson-Hynes
pyeloplasty in children diagnosed of ureteropelvic
junction obstruction.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed two groups of
patients with unilateral ureteropelvic obstuction divided
by mode of presentation. Group 1: 31 children
diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. Group 2: 11 patients
with symptomatic hydronephrosis. All prenatal
diagnosis had obstuctive pattern on 99 TC
Mercaptoacetyltriglycine Scintigraphy normalized after
pyeloplasty. Descriptive statistic is expressed as median
and interquartile range. Age for surgery was : 0,83 years
(0,38-1,46) and 8,45 years (6,71-11,83) (median and
interquartile) respectively. The paired Wilcoxon and
Spearman rank test for nonparametric data were used for
statistical analysis.
Results: There was statistical differences between renal
function before and after pyeloplasty: Prenatal 40%
(33%-47%), 45% (36%-50%) p<0,05. Symptomatic
40% (36%-46%), 45% (40%-47%) p<0,01. No
correlation was found between age of surgery and
improvement in renal function p 0,87. A negative
correlation (correlation coefficient -0,77, p<0,01) was
detected among renal function prior surgery and
improvement after on symptomatic group. Prenatal
group didn’t show a significant correlation.
Conclusions: Our follow up of obstruction prenatally
diagnosed permitted the observation of this children in a
critical interval, avoiding permanent loss of renal
function and averting unnecessary surgical procedures.
We didn’t observe any correlation between age of
surgery and improvement of renal function, that in fact
showed little amelioration, suggesting that renal injury
- 371 -
is probably present in utero. The symptomatic group
evidenced amelioration in less severe affected patients.

Background and Aims: Guidelines from the American
Academy of Pediatrics recommend renal ultrasound and
voiding cystouretrography for young children after first
urinary tract infection. The non-invasive nature, the lack
of radiation, and the low cost of renal ultrasound have
made it an ideal tool for the initial screening
investigation in children with febrile urinary tract
infection. We evaluate the sensitivity and predictive
value of renal ultrasound for vesicoureteral reflux in the
diagnostic workup of urinary tract infections within the
first 24 months of life.
Methods: Prospective study of 383 infants hospitalized
with first febrile urinary tract infection. All of them had
a normal prenatal ultrasound. 141 (36,8%) were males
and 242 (63,2%) were females. 291 (76%) were younger
than a year. Ultrasonography was performed at
hospitalization and cystography was carried out four
weeks later. Analysis of frequencies was done with the
chi square test. Kendall's Tau-b was used as a measure
of ordinal association. Sensitivity, specificity and
predictive values for vesicoureteral reflux were
calculated.
Results: 124 infants (27,2%) had vesicoureteral reflux.
91 (23,8%) had small reflux (1-3) and 13 (3,4%) had
high grade (4-5). Ultrasonography was abnormal in 86
(22,5%). Pathological ultrasound was more frequent in
the reflux group (p < 0,001). Whereas, there was a mild
ordinal association between grade of reflux and
ultrasound result; Kendall's Tau-b 0,269 (p<0,001).
Sensitivity and specificity were 39% and 84%
respectively (PPV 48%, PNV 79%, LR -0,72 and Post-
test negative probability 21%).
Conclusions: Renal ultrasound is not a reliable
procedure to predict vesicoureteral reflux in infants.

Background and Aims: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused
by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR) gene. Defects in the CFTR gene cause
abnormal chloride conductance across the apical
membrane of epithelial cells. It results in progressive
lung disease and also affects different organs. With
longer life expectancy other complications of CF have
become more apparent.
Methods: We present a patient with CF and
symptomatic nephrolithiasis
Results: Several stones were evident in both kidneys.
Hyperoxaluria and Hypocitraturia were evidenced in the
twenty four urine sample, 141 mg/ 24 h / 1,73 m2 and
206 mg/24h/1,73 m2 (177 mg citrate/gr creatinine),
respectively.
Conclusions: Nephrolithiasis should be present in the
differential diagnosis of a patient with CF who has
abdominal pain and urinary excretion of oxalate and
citrate should be investigated.
CPR AND UNCONTROLLED TIDAL VOLUMES
(TV) IN THE DELIVERY ROOM (DR) -
INCREASED RISK FOR
BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA (BPD) IN
VERY PRETERM INFANTS<1250G (VLBW)?
A Castillo, R Deulofeut, A Sola
Department of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine, Emory
University, Atlanta, GA, USA
Background and Aims: BPD is multi-factorial. It is
unknown if VLBW likely to be exposed to brief periods
of “uncontrolled” ventilation, like those requiring “full”
DR-cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DR-CPR), are at a
higher risk for BPD. The objective was to determine if
DR-CPR is associated with BPD in VLBW.
Methods: Analysis of a prospectively collected
database of all VLBW infants admitted to two Emory
University NICU’s from 1/00-12/04 that survived to 36
weeks post-conceptional age (PCA). Exclusion criteria
were major congenital malformations. DR-CPR was
defined as intubation and manual ventilation with chest
compression and/or epinephrine use in the DR. The
primary outcome variable was BPD, defined as the need
for oxygen at 36 weeks PCA. Statistical analysis
included bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic
regression.
Results: 443 infants met enrollment criteria and 57
(13%) were exposed to DR-CPR. Gestational age
[26.7±2.1vs.27.3±2.3;p=0.498], were similar between
DR-CPR and non DR-CPR groups. The proportion of
infants with BPD (61%vs.38%:p=0.001) was
significantly higher in the infants treated with DR-CPR
than in the infants in the non DR-CPR group[OR=2.7
(95%CI=01.51-4.73)] and than the intubated infants
without DR-CPR (61%vs.45%:p=0.019)[OR=1.92
(95%CI=1.07-3.43)] Additionally, these infants who
were intubated but did not receive DR-CPR had higher
- 372 -
rate of BPD (45% vs.16%; p=0.000) than those who
were not intubated [OR=4.34 (95%CI=2.45-7.68)].
Conclusions: DR-CPR is associated with a higher risk
for BPD in VLBW infants. This lends support to the
hypothesis that a brief period of artificial poorly
controlled delivery of TV in the DR may be sufficient to
produce significant lung injury and predispose to BPD.
THE ROUTINE USE OF NASAL CONTINUOUS
POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE AS PRIMARY
SUPPORT IN RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
SYNDROME MAY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT
DELAY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF
SYNTHETIC SURFACTANT
C J Dewhurst, L Phillips, D Roghan
Department of Paediatrics, Countess of Chester
Hospital NHS Trust, Chester, Cheshire, UK
Background and Aims: In infants judged to be at risk
of developing RDS, early prophylactic administration of
synthetic surfactant has been demonstrated to improve
clinical outcome. Increasingly NCPAP is being used in
such infants for respiratory support. It was our unit's
policy that babies who commenced NCPAP did not
receive prophylactic surfactant. The aims of this study
were to identify factors that could predict which babies
would 'fail' on NCPAP support and need subsequent
surfactant administration and ventilation.
Methods: Retrospective study of 70 case notes picked
at random, of babies born between May 03 to May 05 at
less than 33 completed weeks gestation, were reviewed
and data collected on their early respiratory course. This
data was entered into Microsoft Excel and analysed.
Results: Sixteen (23%) babies received NCPAP as
primary support for RDS, with 6 (38%) requiring
subsequent ventilation. Birth weight differed between
the CPAP successes and failures (1519g vs 1283g, p
value = 0.1). All babies over 1400g succeeded on
CPAP. 60% of babies under 1400g required subsequent
ventilation with surfactant administration delayed by on
average 9.8 hours. There was no difference in sex,
gerstation, Apgar score or complication rates between
the two groups.
Conclusions: Using NCPAP as primary support for
respiratory distress syndrome in infants less than 1400g
should be undertaken with caution as it may result in a
delay of surfactant administration. Further, larger
studies are required to identify factors that predict cpap
success or failure.
PREDICTIVE VALUE OF DIFFERENT
PARAMETERS FOR OPTIMAL
ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE POSITION IN
NEONATES

K P Bach, J I M L Verbeke, R M van Elburg
Department of Pediatrics, Subdivision of Neonatology,
VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The
Netherlands
Background and Aims: Simple parameters to estimate
the optimal endotracheal tube (ETT) position are
warranted as chest radiography is considered the gold
standard for ETT position. To estimate the optimal ETT
position in AGA and SGA neonates, we studied both
retrospectively and prospectively the predictive value of
birthweight, weight at intubation, and birth length. In
addition, we studied only prospectively sternum length,
foot length and nose-tragus distance.
Methods: Neonates who were nasotracheally intubated
were studied retrospectively and prospectively. Values
of birthweight, weight at intubation, birth length,
sternum length, foot length and nose-tragus distance
were measured. After correction for neutral head
position, optimal ETT position in chest radiograph was
defined as the position of the tip between 5 mm above
tracheal bifurcation and the level of the first thoracic
vertebra. Only the first intubation in each patient was
used for statistical analysis.
Results: In the retrospective and prospective study 28
and 42 neonates were included respectively (gestational
age 26-42 weeks, birthweight 609-4680 grams).
Birthweight correlated best with optimal ETT position
(r2=0,82). The best intra-class correlation was tubedepth
(mm) = 11,71*birth weight (kg) + 70,78 (r2 = 0,90).
Predictive values for optimal ETT position in AGA
(AGA + SGA) infants were birthweight 73% (69%),
weight at intubation 62% (57%), birth length 69%
(61%), foot length 63% (66%), sternum length 66%
(60%), and nose-tragus distance 60% (63%).
Conclusions: Birthweight is the best predictor for
optimal ETT position in nasotracheally intubated
neonates. However, chest radiography remains
necessary to check for the optimal position.
BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA AND
VENTILATION MODE
T Farstad, M Olsen
Department of Neonatology, Akershus University
Hospital, Norbyhagen, Norway
Background and Aims: Major risk factors in
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) are prematurity,
barotrauma, oxygen therapy, and perinatal infections.
The aim of this study was to investigate how mechanical
ventilation and early nasal CPAP (NCPAP) correlate
with incidence of BPD.
Methods: Infants with Birth Weight (BW) <1 500 g and
Gestation Age (GA) < 34 weeks were identified from
prospective NICU records. Data were analyzed to
predict risk factors associated with occurrence of BPD.
Diagnosis was based on radiological findings and
oxygen dependency at postconceptional age of 36
weeks.
Results: Mean (SD) BW was 1020 (242)g and GA
27(2) wks for the whole group. 18% of infants fulfilled
criteria for BPD. 28% received only NCPAP, 68% were
intubated and received surfactant within one hour after
birth.
Conclusions: There seems to be a correlation between
need for mechanical ventilation for longer than 5 days
and BPD. NCPAP for less than 14 days seems to protect
against BPD However, early surfactant treatment is not
associated with lower BPD incidence.

Background and Aims: Objective was to describe the
use of a multi-disciplinary approach to sepsis
surveillance and evaluate impact on outcome.
Methods: 215 children supported with ECMO January
1999 - December 2004 were included. A
multidisciplinary team met monthly to evaluate cases of
sepsis and update unit policies. Changes in practice were
made at the end of 2001 in order to tackle a high rate of
sepsis: 1) re-education, 2) introduction of electively pre-
primed ECMO circuits and 3) preference for neck rather
than chest cannulation in cardiac patients. Prophylactic
antibiotics were used for 24 hours for procedures.
Results: Over the study period, 39 children had 47
septic episodes, with a rate of 24.9 per 1000 ECMO
days. Multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that
infection was associated with duration of support (OR
1.24, 95% CI 1.15, 1.35 per day) and case-type: closed
versus open chest was protective in cardiac patients (OR
0.08 95% CI 0.01, 0.50). Infection increased the odds of
death by 2.01 (95% CI 1.00, 4.05) but this effect was
less important than case-type and ECMO days. After
policy changes, there was reduced sepsis in respiratory
patients: neonates 28.0 to 6.6 and paediatrics 42.4 to
16.9 episodes per 1000 ECMO days. Despite policy
changes, sepsis remained a problem in cardiac patients
with open sternum: 65.1 per 1000 ECMO days.
Conclusions: ECMO support is high-risk for
nosocomial infection, especially cardiac patients with
open sternum for whom antibiotic prophylaxis is
justified. Multi-disciplinary surveillance offers an
excellent approach for quality improvement in this
challenging field.

Background and Aims: Midazolam is one of the most
widely used sedative agents in the pediatric intensive
care unit (PICU). We tested the hypothesis that
midazolam requirements during prolonged mechanical
ventilation in critically ill children is age dependent.
Methods: Chart records of all children (28 days - 18
year) who were admitted to the PICU between January
1st 2002 and January 1st 2005 were retrospectively
analyzed. Inclusion criteria were controlled mechanical
ventilation for at least five days and initial sedation with
midazolam. The total daily dosage per kilogram body
weight of midazolam and other sedatives were
calculated during the first five days. Statistical analysis
was carried out by means of SPSS 11.
Results: A total of 1186 children were admitted, of
which fifty-eight children fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
The children were divided into three age groups: 28
days - 1 year (n=28), 1-4 years (n=16), older than 4
years (n=14). Within two days after start of mechanical
ventilation the children age 1-4 years received the
maximum midazolam dosage (0.3 mg/kg/hr). In
addition, the total daily dosage of midazolam was higher
at all days compared to the other two age groups. At day
5, 14.3% of children 28 days – 1 year and 7.1% of
children older than 4 years could be adequately sedated
with only midazolam, in contrast none of the children
between 1-4 years.
Conclusions: Children between 1-4 years required more
midazolam as compared to children who are younger or
older and also required several sedative agents in order
to achieve adequate sedation.
CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA - A
15 YEAR SURVEY
E Santos, C Veiga, J Peixoto, L Carvalho, J F Neves
Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Coimbra’s Paediatric
Hospital, Coimbra, Portugal
Background and Aims: Congenital Diaphragmatic
Hernia (CDH) is a condition with a significant
morbidity and mortality, with new treatment strategies
assayed in the last two decades. Coimbra’s Paediatric
Intensive Care Unit (PICU) is the referral neonatal
surgical center of Portugal’s central region since the last
25 years. The authors report on the incidence of CDH in
the region and the effect of delayed surgery on
mortality.
Methods: A retrospective analysis of demographic data
and prognostic risk factors were made including all the
newborn with CDH admitted to PICU during the last 15
years. The newborns were submitted to a similar
protocol management except for high frequency
oscillatory ventilation (HFO) (>1995) and inhaled nitric
oxide (iNO) (> 1998).
Results: Sixty neonates had a diagnosis of CDH, with
an incidence of 2.2 cases/ 10000 life births. Forty one of
them were submitted to conventional ventilatory support
only, and 18 required HFO ventilation. Eight required in
addition iNO. Seven newborns died before surgery (6 in
the first 24 hours of life). Surgery was delayed in 33 of
the 53 patients and no deaths occurred in this group. In
the remaining 20 newborns, 5 died (25%; p=0,005). The
survival rate at discharge was 80%.
- 374 -
Conclusions: The low incidence of CDH in our region,
might be underestimated by hidden mortality before
admission in PICU. No mortality was observed in
patients submitted to delayed surgery. The majority of
deaths occurred in the first 24 hours, meaning the failure
of achieving adequate pulmonary hypertension control.

Background and Aims: Congenital diaphragmatic
hernia (CDH) is the result of incomplete fusion or
hypoplasy of one or more of the embryonic components
of diaphragm, with an estimated incidence of 1/2000 to
1/5000 births. Morgagni hernia is the least common type
of CDH and most are diagnosed late because patients
can be asymptomatic or present with non-specific
respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. Bochdaleck
hernia is the most common type of CDH and, unlike
Morgagni’s, most are dignosed either antenatally or will
present with respiratory distress in the first few hours of
life. However, some present beyond the neonatal period,
posing considerable diagnostic challenges. Chest
radiograph is the first and most important diagnostic
tool.
Methods: Two cases are reported of late presenting
CDH. The first is a Morgagni hernia detected in the
chest radiograph of a four month old healthy female
infant with first episode of respiratory distress syndrome
and confirmed with toracoabdominal ultrasound and
computed tomogram. The second is a Bochdaleck hernia
diagnosed in a six month old (cronologic) preterm male
infant in an abdominal ultrasound for gastroesophageal
reflux research, during etiologic investigation of
persistent respiratory distress syndrome.
Results: In both cases, the defect was repaired promptly
after diagnosis, with full recovery of respiratory
function and no recurrence in the follow-up.
Conclusions: We dicuss the diagnostic importance of
chest radiograph in the first episode of respiratory
distress that doesn’t improve with appropriate theraputic
measures, as the diagnostic possibility of respiratory
congenital anatomic anomaly must always be
considered in this instance.

Background and Aims: Foreign body aspiration is a
serious situation which may result into respiratory
distress, pulmonary lesion or even death. More than two
thirds of foreign body aspiration cases occur among
children under 3 years old and organic materials are the
most commonly aspirated. Diagnosis is frequently
difficult and delayed, as in about half of the cases the
chocking episode is missed, there is a wide range of
clinical presentation, which frequently mimics other
illnesses, and none of the imaging methods employed in
such cases are diagnostic. Bronchoscopy is frequently
necessary for diagnosis and treatment. When diagnosis
is delayed, complications of a retained foreign body
such as unresolving pneumonia, lung abscess, recurrent
haemoptysis and bronchiectasis may occur.
Methods: The authors present three cases of foreign
body aspiration (sunflower seeds) in patients at different
ages and with different clinical presentations; all had a
delay in diagnosis ranging from days to months.
Results: All cases were diagnosed and treated with
bronchoscopy, with immediate recovery from
respiratory symptoms.
Conclusions: These cases demonstrate that a high index
of suspicion and a careful history in a child with
persistent/recurrent respiratory symptoms, along with
bronchoscopy, are the cornerstones of diagnosis and
treatment of foreign body in the airway.
TRACHEO-ESOPHAGEAL FISTULA: IS
CHRONIC PULMONARY DISEASE POSSIBLE?

Institute for Respiratory Diseases in Children-Kozle,
Skopje, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Tracheo-esophageal fistula
(TEF) is congenital anomaly of two types: With and
without atresio oesophagi. Late sequels are possible like
bronchiectasis as result of recurrent respiratory
infections or aspiration.
Methods: We would like to describe case of a boy who
was born with atresio oesophagy and TEF, which were
corrected with surgery, the second day after birth. After
that, he had a great number of hospitalizations because
of pneumonias e aspirationem, strydor, and cough.
During the first year, oesophagus balloon dilatation was
made. In this period, bronchoscopy exploration showed
bronchomalatio, as a result of surgery. Because of
recurrent symptoms, many investigations were made
when a boy was 5 years old.
Results: Lab tests results (SE, blood count,
immunoglobulins, sweet test, and other) were in regular
values. Chest X-ray: bilateral patchy infiltrates,
hyperinflation. Bronchoscopic findings: Tracheomalatio
in middle part of trachea (surgery side); generally white
mucus and like casts in bronchus of middle lobe.
Perfusion scan: Left-hypoperfusio of posterior and
latero-basal segments at the lower lobe; right -
subsegmental changes in postero-basal segment at the
lower lobe. HRCT: Proximal part of trachea with
membranous part thickness (3-4 cm), thickness of the
bronchi wall for a middle and upper lobe.
- 375 -
Conclusions: In our case, at this moment, chronic
pulmonary disease is not evident. Our patient likes
healthy. We proved only tracheomalatio, probably
transitory, as a surgery sequel, some changes in
perfusion and bronchi walls. Further follow-up is
necessary.
EVENTRATION OF THE DIAPHRAGM - CASE
REPORT
D Dervishov
Children Hospital, Veles, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Relaxation and atrophy of the
diaphragm is also called event ration. In that situation
diaphragm is having high position, causing prolapse of
organs in thorax cavity, compression on lungs and
dislocation mediastinal organs on the opposite site.
Goal: To present 6 months old baby hospitalised on the
Children's Department in Medical centre in Veles.
Methods: Heteroanamnesis, clinical examination, RTG
of lungs, ultrasonography and CTM of diaphragm,
laboratory analysis
Results: Six months old boy conscious, febrile with
tachydyspnea. On auscultation crude vesicular breathing
and tiny and middle wet bronchitis snores with
prolonged expiration.
Conclusions: Examinations RTG of lungs: High
position of the right part of diaphragm (picture 1).
Ultrasonography: Eventration of diaphragm in her
medial and frontal part with normal density. In elevated
part is noted liver tissue (picture 2). KTM of diaphragm:
Mediastinum is normal. Scintigraphy: From 14th to 19th
is detected liver issue on the right side like result of
eventrated (hypoplastic) diaphragm (picture 3).
Laboratory analysis. After treatment with antibiotics,
i.v. and inhalator corticosteroids, oxygen, the patient is
sent in Clinical centre on Surgery department.
Conclusion: Eventration of diaphragm is rear disease
with incidence of 10% of all congenital diaphragm
disorders. The treatment of choice is surgical.

B Mladenovic
Institute for Respiratory Diseases in Children, Kozle-
Skopje, Macedonia
Background and Aims: The causes of recurrent
spasmodic croup are unclear. The acute onset of the
attacks without signs of acute infection, the short
duration (few hours or less) and usually excellent
respond to a symptomatic therapy, show that allergy
may play an important role. The aim of this study is to
determinate the probably role of allergy as etiological
factor of recurrent spasmodic croup.
Methods: A group of 75 children with anamnesis of
recurrent croup episodes who were performed to skin
prick tests was analyzed. The evidence of family and
personal atopy was explored. The most frequent
allergens were determined.
Results: 49 children (65,3%) from this group had
positive skin prick test. 29 of them had another allergy
comorbidity (asthma, dermatitis allergica, rhinitis
allergica). 11 children from the 26 with negative prick
skin tests had positive anamnesis for personal or/and
family allergy: 6 dermatitis atopica, 2 asthma, 5
recidivate bronchoobstructive episodes,7 positive
anamnesis of asthma. Only in 11 children (21, 3%) there
was no evidence for allergy. The most frequent positive
allergens were: pollens 18 children, Dermatofagoides
pteronnysimmus 16 children and etc.
Conclusions: It appears that allergy is an important
factor in etiology of recurrent spasmodic croup in
children.
VENTILATORY STRATEGIES IN BELGIAN
NICUS
I Van Herreweghe, G Delanghe, E Chevalier,
R Ciardelli, D Haumont
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Saint-Pierre University
Hospital, Brussels, Belgium
Background and Aims: In 2004 all Belgian NICU
admissions were registered in a national database. One
fifth of the babies was hospitalised for respiratory
distress syndrome (RDS). Evidence based guidelines on
ventilatory strategies and surfactant administration are
well established. The aim of this study was to compare
among the different NICU centres the application of
these strategies and the pulmonary outcome in Very
Low Birth-weight Infants (VLBWI).
Methods: Records of 840 VLBWI were analysed.
Duration of endotracheal ventilation and CPAP,
surfactant administration, chronic lung disease (CLD) at
36 weeks, presence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)
(grade 3 or>) and steroid use were recorded.
Results: 538 infants (68% of all VLBWI) had diagnosis
of RDS. Of the 495 intubated infants 80% were treated
with surfactant (inter-centre range 56% to 100%). The
mean gestational age in this group was significantly
lower (27.6 +/- 1.9 weeks versus 28.4+/- 1.8 weeks;
p<0.0001). Below 28 weeks 83% were treated. CPAP
use varied among centres (median CPAP ventilation
days: range 1.0 to 43.0 days). Steroids were used in 35%
of the infants (range 0% to 64%). CLD occurred in
11.5% of the babies (range 0% to 42%) receiving
steroids in 50% (range 0 to 100%). ROP was found in
5% of the survivors and was related to gestational age.
Only 7 of 17 centres reported ROP.
Conclusions: In Belgian NICUs there are large inter-
centre variations in medical strategies for RDS. Existing
evidence based guidelines were not systematically
applied. Establishing national guidelines on surfactant
use and ventilation seems necessary.

Background and Aims: Problem statement: High
morbidity of Bronchial asthma; High rate of temporary
or chronicle disability, caused by allergic diseases.
Methods: Problem statement: High morbidity of
Bronchial asthma; High rate of temporary or chronicle
disability, caused by allergic diseases; Sometimes
doctors are unable to manage well bronchial asthma
(BA), because of neglected early diagnostic.
Results: Study findings confirm causal connection (with
high relative risk) and significant probability of the
disease (with high attributive risk), with 'major risk
factors': allergic diseases and atopic dermatitis in
relatives and with 'minor risk factors': allergic rhinitis.
Relatively weak risk factors (with low relative risk), but
with high prevalence in child population in Batumi were
found: respiratory infections and bottle-feeding.
According to finding data indoor ecological factors (dust
collectors, humidity, mould, active cigarette smoking,
house heating and number of family members) have
significant influence on sensibility occurrence frequency
to house dust mite, mould fungi and other everyday
allergens and bronchial asthma formation in children.
Conclusions: Revealing individual and population risk
phenomenology of bronchial asthma in children
population in Batumi, on the basis of that the most of
risk factors can be monitored, will promote asthma
prevention and population health care, which is more
rational and cost-effective.
DETERMINANTS OF PROLONGED ASTHMA
HOSPITALIZATION IN INNER-CITY
CHILDREN

Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Albert Einstein
College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA
Background and Aims: Identifying the factors
associated with prolonged asthma hospitalizations for
this population may help to decrease length of stay and
reduce hospital costs. Objective: To identify
determinants of prolonged hospitalization in inner-city
minority children with asthma.
Methods: Retrospective cohort study between 1/1/98-
10/1/04. Long-stay group defined as children
hospitalized with asthma for more than 3 days. Short-
stay group were hospitalized 3 days or less. Bivariate
analyses (t-test, chi-square test) and logistic regression
were used.
Results: Of 479 subjects, 60% were Hispanic, 36%
African American, 64% male and the mean age was 6.6
years (SD 5.3). Mean length of stay was 3.1 days (SD
1.7). 30% of subjects were in the long-stay group; and
were older (7.6 years vs 6.1 years, p=.006), had greater
mean number of lifetime asthma admissions (8.2 vs 3.8,
p=.002) and were more likely to receive a pulmonary
consultation during the index hospitalization (OR 4.2,
95% CI 2.6-6.9). Long-stay group were also more likely
to be admitted to the ICU (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.6-4.2) and
to require oxygen supplementation (OR 3.2, 95% CI
2.1-4.9) during the index hospitalization. Using logistic
regression, oxygen requirement, multiple asthma
admissions, and pulmonary consultation during the
index admission were independent predictors of
prolonged hospitalization. We found no significant
group differences on exposure to environmental triggers,
mean number of days with worsening asthma symptoms
and home management prior to admission.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that inner-city
children with more severe asthma have longer hospital
stay.

Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain
Background and Aims: To compare the effect of
synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV)
vs. synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with
volume-guarantee (SIMV + VG) on tidal volume (VT),
peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), mean airway pressure
(MAP), oxygen saturation (SpO2) in the extreme
premature.
Methods: A total of 58 VLBW were randomised to
receive SIMV or SIMV+VG from 30 min after the first
surfactant dose until extubation or failure of ventilation
mode or dead.
Results: There were no differences in demographic
variables in the two groups. In the first 48 hours airway
pressure was higher in SIMV (PIP 18.7±2.9 vs 14.9±1.9,
p <0.0001 / MAP 7.7± 1.7 vs 5.3± 0.91, p <0.001), VT
vas lower and less variable during SIMV+VG (6.2±1.1
vs 4.7±0.9, p <0.0001) for similar CO2 concentration
(45.8±6.6 in SIMV vs 48.6±6.1 in SIMV+VG, NS). In
SIMV group there were three episodes hypocarbia vs
none in de SIMV+VG group. There was lower FiO2
(27.7±4.5 vs 25.1±3.6, p 0,03) for similar SpO2 during
SIMV+VG.
Conclusions: SIMV+VG appears to be more effective
and less dangerous than SIMV. Less pressure is needed
to obtain similar blood gases. Lower and more stable
VT are recorded, with less episodes of hypocarbia.

Background and Aims: Several animal models have
been proposed to study the pathophysiology of
congenital diaphragmatic hernia (DH). Surgical
induction of DH in fetal rabbits during the
pseudoglandular phase has been shown to induce severe
pulmonary hypoplasia, but functional studies in this
model are scarce. We aimed to measure neonatal
pulmonary impedance and related it to the severity of
lung hypoplasia.
Methods: DH was surgically created in rabbits at 23
days of gestation. Following cesarean delivery at term
(31 days) pups were subjected to measurement of total
lung capacity (TLC), lung to body weight ratio (LBWR)
and lung impedance by forced oscillation technique.
Airway resistance (Raw), elastance (HL), tissue
damping (GL) and hysteresivity (GL/HL) were
calculated from impedance data.
Results: 12 DH fetuses and 15 controls were available
for final analysis. LBWR and TLC were significantly
lower in the DH group compared to gestational and age
matched controls (p<0.001). Raw, HL, GL and
hysteresivity were significantly increased in DH fetuses.
Group differences in tissue mechanics were best
described by hysteresivity, indicating a dominant
contribution of lung tissue mechanics to DH-induced
lung hypoplasia.
Conclusions: We successfully introduced lung
impedance measurement by forced oscillation technique
in neonatal rabbits. Following surgical induction of DH
in the pseudoglandular phase, they have, next to
morphological evidence of pulmonary hypoplasia,
changes in lung mechanics. Our results for lung tissue
mechanics support the concept of delayed pulmonary
tissue modeling. We propose to use functional studies in
future experiments when evaluating prenatal
interventions aimed at reversing pulmonary hypoplasia.

Background and Aims: Joubert Syndrome (JS) is a
rare genetic brain malformation characterized by
absence or underdevelopment of cerebellar vermis. The
common features of JS in infants include hyperpnea,
nystigmus, mental retardation, and ataxia. The purpose
of study is to increase awareness for the clinical and
neuroimaging findings of Joubert syndrome for the
correct diagnosis of this rare congenital malformation.
Methods: Eight patients with Joubert syndrome were
identified from 3 hospital pediatric departments
databases covering a 5-year period. Criteria for
diagnosis included absent or markedly hypoplastic
cerebellar vermis, abnormal eye movements, and
developmental delay. Radiological scans reports,
clinical notes, biochemical results and opthalmological
evaluation were available for all the 8 patients. 6 cases
were clinically reviewed to assess visual
electrophysiology and 2 patients had died.
Results: Cerebellar vermis hypoplasia/aplasia and apnea
were present in all patients, polydactly in 1 of 8, renal
problems with cysts in 3 patients and 4 of 6 had
abnormal electroretinograms (ERGs). Blood
investigations of organic acids, amino acids and very-
long-chain fatty acid, were normal in the 7 patients
tested.
Conclusions: JS is a rare genetic brain malformation
with association of retinal dystrophy and renal
abnormalities. The retinal dystrophy may be
progressive. The prognosis of patients depends mainly
on the degree of brain malformation.

Background and Aims: To evaluate a commercially
available vibrating bladder stimulator for use in
reducing the time spent waiting for children to produce a
urine sample in acute paediatrics.
Methods: All non-continent children needing a urine
sample attending a children’s emergency department
were included. Exclusions were neuro-anatomical
abnormalities and those who were too unwell. After
informed consent, children were randomised either to an
“advice” group, given an advice sheet of traditional
methods for urine stimulation, or a “device” group,
where they were offered the use of a bladder stimulator.
Both were administered by the parents. Ethics
committee approval was granted.
Results: 110 patients consented, from which we had 97
datasets (48 advice, 49 device). 11 advice and 15 device
children left the department without a sample being
obtained (not significant). Mean waiting time was 1
hour and 2 minutes. 61% in the advice group waited for
over one hour compared to 46% in the device group
(p=0.15). and a mean reduction in waiting times by 18
minutes (p=0.2). Kaplan-Meyer plot identified a
population of children who may benefit from bladder
stimulation.
Conclusions: There is a trend towards reduced waiting
times when the bladder is vibrated by a device compared
to traditional methods. However, we still had a
significant waiting time even with use of the stimulator.
The device is noisy and can frighten small children.
Although the use of this cheap and easily available
device may reduce waiting times, the search for a
reliable urinary stimulator in children continues.

Background and Aims: Atopic dermatitis - common
inflammatory skin disease, with an high prevalence in
children and infants. The aim of this study was to
investigate clinical efficacy of the new steroid-free
Ascancol - bentonite gel in patients with atopic
dermatitis.
Methods: The study was designed as open-controlled,
80 children aged 36 month to 14 years with Atopic
Dermatitis were randomized 1:1 to a Ascancol-based
regimen (n=40) or a conventional treatment (hormonal,
symptomatic indifferent ointments) regimen (n=40). All
patients underwent a 3-9 months (catamnesis) run-in
period, to assess their baseline conditions. The
effectiveness of the treatment is evaluated by
determining the index SCORAD until and after the
treatment.
Results: The results shows that in patients with severe
atopic dermatitis there were no significant differences
among the clinical features, basal symptoms or atopic
status between the children with administration of
Ascancol and OSMF for external use. Ascancol was
effective in 66,7% of cases (significant improvement in
46,7%, improvement in-26, 7%); in cases of intertrigo
significant improvement in 75%, improvement in 25%
of patients; in cases of Eczema - significant
improvement in 48%, improvement in 25% of patients;
ill health-in 13% of patients with eczema (dry) and
neurodermitis.
Conclusions: Generalizing results according to
SCORAD index, in AD monotherapy with Ascancol and
with OSMF, according to comparison data of drying and
antipruritic effects, Ascancol is preferential than OSMF
for external use, especially in early childhood.

Health Care Unit of Ferrara, Emilia-Romagna Region,
Italy
Background and Aims: In Italy, the enlarged practice
of international adoptions and increasing immigration of
children highlights the need to adequate Italian public
health services. In particular, international adopted
children represent a group with unique health care
needs. Data from published studies suggest that the risk
of serious infections in adoptees is low, although
evidence-based medicine on which to base screening
protocols for this segment of population is lacking.
Methods: All health and vaccination records of some
child immigrated or internationally adopted in Ferrara,
Italy, were reviewed. If a reliable immunization record
is presented, one need not repeat the vaccines or check
titers. In absence of documentation, routine serological
screening tests for diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis and
hepatitis B have been performed. A tuberculin skin test
was performed on someone, and a chest radiograph had
been obtained for any individual with a positive PPD. In
addition, special screening tests (e.g., for malaria,
hepatitis C, MMR) were indicated by paediatricians on
the basis of specific child's age and/or acute medical
needs.
Results: This study started one year ago. Of 94
immigrants notified in the same period, 72 (76,5%) were
sent referral letters. Most of the others lacked valid
addresses. Of the 44 (46.8%) who were examined, 26
(59%) were serologically screened, 15 (34%) were
recommended vaccination, and 14 (31.8%) completed it.
Conclusions: Indicators based on measurements of
health in foreign or adopted children are important for
identifying problems and priorities, changes over time,
and newly emergent issues in a newly segment of Italian
population.

problems during growing. According to the obtain
antybiograms most often proved evokers are:
Straphyloccocus Beta haemiliticus, pyogenus,
Haemophylus infl, Staphylococus aureus. Fourteen of
twenty children have been expose to surgery and their
health problems were improved and the condition of
other six children remain the same.
Conclusions: According to opinion of ENT specialist
Tonsilloadenoidectomia should be used to all children
with chronicle infected Waldeyerov lymphatic in order
to prevent possible complications.

Department of Immunology, University Children's
Hospital Skopje, Skopje, Macedonia
Background and Aims: Present the clinical and
immunological characteristics of acute nonbacterial
respiratory tract infections in preschool children.
Methods: 38 children with bronchopneumonia at age of
6 months to 7 years, hospitalized at Department of
Immunology, were investigated. Pneumoslide M
(Vircell) - immunflurescent test for detection of specific
IgM and IgG antibodies was performed.
Results: 20 children (57%) had positive result for more
than one infection. The most frequent was Mycoplasma
pneumonia infection - 17 children (48.6%), from which
12 had co-infection. The frequency of the other present
infections was as follows: Adenovirus and Influenza B
infection in 12 children (31.5%), Parainfluenza in 10
children (28.6%) and RSV in 9 children (25.7%).
Laboratory tests of children with Mycoplasma infection
showed: CRP=34 ± 33g/l, ESR 35.7 ± 36 mm and
normal level of immunoglobulin. Children with
Adenovirus showed increased level of inflammatory
markers (ESR=52 ± 25 mm, CRP=57 ± 66 g/l), IgM
(1.28 ± 0.7 g/l) and a lower level of IgA (0.79 ± 0.6 g/l).
Urticaria or exanthematous rash were connected with
Mycoplasma pneumonia infection (35%), RSV (33%)
and 25% with adenovirus and influenza B infection.
Children with isolated viral infection had significantly
lower level of ESR, IgA and IgM (p<0.05) compared
with children with more infections.
Conclusions: Nonbacterial infections are common in
preschool children with acute respiratory tract infection.
The children are competent to produce specific
antibodies, which is stronger if there is more than one
infection. The most frequent is Mycoplasma pneumonia
infection with most common clinical sign of urticaria or
exanthematous rash.

Korinthos, Korinthos, Greece
Background and Aims: Community-acquired
Pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common infections
in the pediatric age group and one of the leading
diagnoses that result in overnight hospital admission for
children. The aim of the study was to evaluate the
clinical and epidemiological characteristics of children
hospitalized for pneumonia in our geographic area.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical
records of 37 children hospitalized for pneumonia
confirmed by radiological images, total leucocyte count
(>15.000/ml) and C-reactive protein value (>80mg/l).
Age, sex, symptoms on admission, diagnosis, seasonal
variation and outcome were evaluated. All patients were
followed-up for 15 to 30 days after diagnosis to
ascertain outcome.
Results: Between February 2005 and January 2006, 37
children aged 3 months to 14 years old with pneumonia
were enrolled. The mean age was 5.6 ±1.2 years. There
were 18 (49%) boys and 19 (51%) girls. A total of 8%
were aged less than 6 months. The individual
background was unremarkable in 27 (73%) children.
The main symptoms were fever (86%), cough (22.3%),
general malaise (14.9%), respiratory distress (9.2%),
thoracic pain (3.3%), and headache (1.2%). During the
winter months, there was up to a 50% increase in the
number of cases compared with the summer months.
Outcome was favorable in all children.
Conclusions: CAP in hospitalized children is most
frequent in previously healthy children, especially aged
2 to 6 years old, with fever nonspecific signs and
symptoms that are similar to those of other infections
and respiratory processes. Recommendations for
diagnosing and treating CAP may be advisable.
DEVELOPING INFECTION CONTROL
STRATEGY: RISK FACTOR ANALYSIS IN
TERTIARY REFERRAL UNIT FROM ROMANIA
P Avram, M Craiu, A V Cochino
Institute for Mother and Child Care, Bucharest,
Romania
Background and Aims: Before 1989, in Romania,
nosocomial infections were exceptionally reported. To
improve infection control in our ICU, we conducted a
case series study.
Methods: Two years (2004-2005) retrospective study in
17 infants, admitted in ICU. Control group: 46 infants,
admitted in the same period, for documented
noninfectious causes. We studied comparative risk
factors (sex, socials, gestationals, birth related, invasive
procedures, septic work-up, antibiotic treatment).
Results: Identified pathogens: Klebsiella spp. (47.05%),
E.coli (29.4%), Staphylococcus spp. (17.64%),
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.76%), enterococcus
(5.88%), resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.88%).
Risk factors (table). Five infants expired - 2 from the
infected group (infection-related death OR=2.87).
Conclusions: 1. Most pathogens were gram negative
rods (76.47%), Klebsiella dominating (47.05%).
2. Multiresistant strains frequency was higher in 2004;
similar findings regarding concomitant multiple
bacterial infection. 3. Home delivery was the most
important risk factor for severe neonatal infection.
4. Empiric treatment with antibiotics before referral
increases the chance of severe bacterial infection
(OR=1.9). 5. Prematurity was not a significant risk
factor; probably related to advanced care provided.
Neither were invasive procedures (MV, central lines).
6. In 2005 were admitted 854 more patients than in
2004; still, the relative reduction of severe infection
frequency was 20.17%.

Background and Aims: The aim of this study was to
establish the profile of genetic disorders and congenital
malformation in children less than 15 years old in an
Israeli Arab town.
Methods: We studied 7200 children in an Arab town in
the center of Israel, over a six-year period. The study
was partly conducted prospectively and partly
retrospectively. The prospective part, which comprised
all the children born after January 1998, and the
retrospective part was concerned with children who
were born prior to January 1998 by examining the
medical records of the children. The cut off age for these
children was the 15th birthday. The genetic disorder and
major congenital malformations were recorded.
Results: 514 (71.4/1000) had genetic disorders or
congenital malformations. 39 (7.6%) had multiple
malformations and 430 (83.7%) had involvement of
single system. The most common system with isolated
single malformation was cardiovascular 109 (21.2%)
and in other systems it was in the CNS, Genitourinary,
Ophthalmological, Dermatological, Gastrointestinal,
Musculoskeletal, Hematological/Immunological and Ear
and Nose: 85 (18%), 85 (18%), 44 (8.6%), 29 (5.6%),
27 (5.27%), 22 (4.3%), 14 (2.7%) and 8 (1.55%)
respectively. Twelve (1.6%) of the multiple anomalies
were syndromes and twenty seven children had
abnormalities which could not be classified. The
prevalence of defined and suspected autosomal
recessive disorders in the population was 1:90.
Conclusions: Each village and town in this high risk
community has its own genetic and congenital
malformations. Suitable comprehensive plan for
prevention is warranted.
THE ROLE OF PEDIATRICIANS IN
PROPHYLAXIS OF DENTAL CARIES
A Nitsch-Osuch, E Gyrczuk, A Wardyn
Department of Family Medicine, Medical University of
Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland
Background and Aims: Dental caries (DC) is an
infectious and preventable disease of a great social
impact. In Polish pre-school children DC is present in
more than 90%. The aim of a pediatrician should be to
prevent DC by education of children and their parents
regarding hygienic and nutritional habits and fluoride
supplementation. Our task has been to learn parents
knowledge concerning prophylactic procedures
connected with DC in their preschool children.
Methods: We obtained fulfilled surveys with questions
about prevention of DC from 98 parents of children
attending to one of public day care facilities in Warsaw.
Results: Most of parents (76%) self estimated their
knowledge about prophylaxis of DC as being 'not
enough'. Only in 38% parents the main source of
information about DC was medical staff (61% learnt
some information from popular newspapers). The mean
age of first visit of a child to a dentist was 3,6 years. In
parents opinion pediatrician was not oriented for
prophylaxis of dental caries (88% opinions). Only 56%
of them were provided by pediatricians with some
peaces of advice regarding oral hygiene, fluoride
supplementation or nutritional habits - playing the role
in prophylaxis of DC.
Conclusions: Our results show that pediatricians are not
active enough in a field of DC prophylaxis. Parents are
not aware enough how to prevent DC in their children.
We should encourage pediatricians to educate their
patients in a field of oral hygiene, nutritional habits, safe
fluoride supplementation.
BREASTFEEDING THE PREMATURE INFANT
R Maastrup
NICU, Rigshospitalet, University Hospital,
Copenhagen, Denmark
Background and Aims: A great number of the
premature infants are not able to suck at birth due to
their immaturity. This challenges the nurse at her
professional efforts to create frames and expectation for
breastfeeding, and to give support and counselling to the
mother for a successfully breastfeeding before
discharge.
Methods: A breastfeeding policy is developed: Already
the first day the mother will be informed about the
importance of breastfeeding for the premature infant and
encouraged in expressing her milk. Written material is
distributed to support oral information. The
breastfeeding process, “The Milky-Way” is a guideline
in transitioning the premature infant from tube-feeding
to exclusively breastfeeding. The first step on “The
Milky Way” is skin-to-skin contact. This is easy as in
Denmark we mostly use nasal-CPAP rather than
ventilator treatment when possible. As soon as the infant
is stabile with nasal-CPAP it will be put to the mother’s
breast to smell and taste and suck for pleasure. This will
help the infant to be able to suck sooner when strong
enough. The transitioning process will often take time
for the premature infant, from days to weeks. During
this period the parents and nurse will make daily
evaluation of the infant’s maturity and abilities as for the
plan of breastfeeding.
Results: All mothers start expressing milk. All infants
receive skin-to-skin contact, and all infants suck for
pleasure. 67% of the infants are exclusive breastfed at
discharge and 15% partial breastfed.
- 381 -
Conclusions: Breastfeeding is science for the nurse but
art for the mother.
DEVELOPMENT AND APPLIANCE OF
EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL TO PREPARE
CHILDREN AND PARENTS TO
VENOPUNCTURE
M L G Pedreira, M A M Pettengill, A R Bezerra,
V Guarise
Department of Nursing, Federal University of São
Paulo, São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil
Background and Aims: Many children and their
parents consider venopuncture as one of the most
traumatic event during illness and hospitalization
because of their fear of needles and pain. There are
evidences relating parent's anxiety during venopuncture
and children's stress. Considering that both children and
their parents should be prepared for this situation, it is
essential to elaborate strategies and instruments, in order
to meet their needs, such as the development of
educational and instructional material regarding
venopuncture. The aim of this paper is to describe the
material's construction and its appliance in clinical
setting.
Methods: A participant methodological framework was
performed in a pediatric unit of a public teaching
hospital in São Paulo city, Brazil. In order to be
acquainted with the scientific evidences, a literature
review was carried out. After that, a field phase was
conducted, applying qualitative contend analysis to
understand the child and parents' needs of information
allied to venopunction, in their perspective, as well in
the professionals. Data were compared and organized in
a creative book format. Finally, three specialists and the
subjects validated the material.
Results: The book has been systematically applied with
children and their parents before the venopuncture
procedure. They reveal their satisfaction with the
preparation for the procedure with the educational
material, acknowledging its importance.
Conclusions: The evaluation disclose that it is a very
significant instrument to be used in nursing practice
with children and their parents because attend their
needs of information and strengthen their capacity to
participate in the care, which contributes to minimize
their fear and anxiety.

TAKING IT GLOBAL
C D Philips, W Moulsdale, M DeLand
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Sunnybrook and Womens
Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada
Background and Aims: Canadian Neonatal Network
and The Shanghai Children's Hospital of Fudan
University launched, in October 2005, the People's
Republic of China Neonatal Nurses Training Program.
This global partnership is aimed at improving the
quality and efficacy of neonatal care in China, and
provides a unique opportunity for nurses to participate
in an evidence-based clinical collaboration. Specific
objectives of the program include, establishing a centre
dedicated to training neonatal nurses, as well as
establishing a national standard for neonatal nursing
education in China.
Methods: Planning an international training program
requires a focused and committed management team.
Essential elements include developing the content and
methods for its’ delivery, as well as strategizing
logistical details, from immigration requirements, to the
preparation and printing of course materials. This
dynamic process is ongoing and must include
evaluation, and creative problem solving at every stage
of program development.
Results: Benefits of our successful international
exchange of knowledge included, increased cross-
cultural awareness, personal and professional
development and potential for international research
collaboration.
Conclusions: The value of mentorship in adult learning
is increasingly recognized. This global initiative places
an emphasis on mentorship, while encouraging
leadership and helping to establish excellence in clinical
practice in order to advance neonatal nursing
worldwide. The collaboration recognizes, realizes, and
enhances the impact of nursing, while developing a new
avenue for professional enrichment. Developing
exciting new ways to utilize knowledge and experience
leads to increased job satisfaction, staff retention, and
morale. The ultimate goal of targeted international
academic exchange however is improved patient and
family outcomes.
PRACTICE EDUCATOR ON THE PEDIATRIC
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT: A MUCH-NEEDED
PROFESSIONAL!
R F W Van Den Berg, A P Verest, I van 't Wout,
M van Dijk
Department of Pediatric Surgery, Erasmus MC-Sophia
Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: There is a clear role for the
practice educator in the pediatric intensive care
environment considering the high nursing shortages and
turnover of patients. Supervising adults requires skills
such as teaching at the learner's level, helping learners to
use their knowledge and skills, and adapting supervision
to individual needs. This study evaluates the work of
two practice educators in pediatric intensive care.
Methods: The two practice educators of the Pediatric
Surgical Intensive Care Unit of the Erasmus MC-Sophia
Children's Hospital retrospectively classified focus of
their supervision during the previous two years broadly
as follows: Knowledge/skills, psychological and
supportive. Thirty-eight nurse students were asked to
provide a strength/weakness analysis and information on
prior education and working experience.
Results: From October 2003 to October 2005 two
practice educators supervised a total of 38 students.
Median age of the 34 female and 4 male students was 29
years (range 21 to 41 years). They were training for
general pediatric nurse (n=10), high care nurse (n=16),
or pediatric intensive care nurse (n=12). Supervision
focused on knowledge/skills in 16 (42.1%), supportive
- 382 -
and/or psychological in 5 (13.1%), and on all three or
two areas including knowledge/skills in 17 students
(44.8%). Six students struggled with their student role.
Strengths and weaknesses mentioned were
giving/receiving feedback, perfectionist, connect theory
and practice.
Conclusions: Focus and intensity of supervision in
pediatric intensive care should be geared to a student's
work experience, educational level, personality and life
experience, and require flexible and highly
individualized approach from the practice educator.
CLINICAL SUPERVISION IN PRACTICE
I M Thruston
Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Evelina Childrens'
Hospital, Guys' and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust,
London, UK
Background and Aims: Clinical Supervision is an
effective process in reducing stress and burnout that
staff working in critical care areas can experience.
Clinical Supervision has been defined as ‘A formal
process of professional support and learning which
enables individual practitioners to develop knowledge
and competence, assume responsibility for their own
practice, and enhance consumer protection and safety of
care in complex clinical situations. It is central to the
process of learning and to the expansion of the scope of
practice and should be seen as the means for
encouraging self-assessment and analytic and reflective
skills’ (Department of Health, (DOH) 1994).
Methods: Supervisory models are useful to provide
structure and direction to clinical supervision sessions.
Guided reflection offers an effective way of structuring
clinical supervision and is central to the process. Many
methods for reflection have been identified and different
models have been designed.
Results: Benefits of Clinical Supervision have been
shown in recruitment and retention and continuing
professional development. Participants of supervision
have reported increased competence, confidence,
increased job satisfaction and accountability, feeling
valued and supported, reduced stress, reduced sickness,
professional development, improved teamwork, and
healthier work environment.
Conclusions: Clinical supervision requires
organisational endorsement and commitment and
stakeholders want evidence of its effectiveness. Clinical
supervision is supported both at national and local level.
Guys’ and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust endorses
clinical supervision in its’ ‘Nursing and Midwifery
Strategy’ and actively encourages staff to take part in it.
Clinical supervision is an essential component of the
clinical governance framework to support and safeguard
quality practice.
NURSING INDICATORS IC NEONATOLOGY
A T A M Claassen
Department of Neonatology, Emma Children's Hospital,
Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: To test the 'List of
requirements of the Nursing Care within the
Neonatology Department' (1997). The current testing
methods are time consuming and labour-intensive. To
develop a set of indicators derived from the norms in the
list of requirements. With these indicators the nurses
should be able to monitor and direct the delivered care
by themselves, and receive continuous feedback of the
quality-level of nursing practice.
Methods: The project consists of a development,
realization and after-care phase. In the development
phase the indicators are developed stepwise. Based on
set criteria selections were made. An indicator-
development-form describes the method of
measurement, the applied criteria and the method of
collecting data. During the realization phase the
developed indicators will be measured supported by an
instruction-measurement-form, which enables every
nurse to perform the test (once a month, takes about 3
hours). Results are published monthly on a poster. In the
after-care phase, the results are evaluated. When the
results are repeatedly below the norm for a specific
indicator, an improvement project is started.
Results: Since the beginning of the project (2003), a
total of 20 indicators are tested, 3 improvement projects
are finalized and 2 new projects are started. The
improvement projects are coordinated by nurses. Overall
these results lead to critical contemplation and reflection
in our department. Employees feel responsible for the
results, and thus for delivering high-quality-care.
Conclusions: In our Neonatology department we
showed with a small set of indicators important aspects
of nursing care can be measured.

Pediatric Intensive Care
Unit, Hospital São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil
Background and Aims: Oral care has been described
as capable to prevent VAP, reducing duration of
mechanical ventilation, length of stay (LOS) and use of
systemic antibiotics in adult patients. The aim of this
study was to compare the duration of mechanical
ventilation and LOS of children in a PICU, according
oral care intervention.
Methods: Prospective randomized study realized in a
PICU in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. The research was
approved by the ethics committee. The sample was
composed of 56 children, 29 (51.8%) in Control Group-
CG (mechanical intervention) and 27 (48.2%) in
Experimental Group-EG (0.12% chlorhexidine); 47
(83.9%) children received mechanical ventilation.
Complementary variables of children's characteristics
and intensive care were collected. Significance level (p)
was set at 5%.
Results: There was no significant influence of oral care
intervention on duration of mechanical ventilation (CG
- 383 -
122.6±120.0; EG 147.4±157.4 hours; p= 0.670) and
LOS (CG 6.0± 4.4; EG 6.4±7.6 days; p=0.218). The
results demonstrated no significant differences between
the distribution of demographic characteristics of the
sample in the groups: age (p=0.854), gender (0.945),
skin color (0.983), nutritional status (0.531), clinical
conditions of mouth (0.414), teeth (0.343), presence of
infections (0.222) at admission, tracheal intubation
status (0.716), and use of enteral tubes (0.712).
Conclusions: There was no significant influence of the
studied oral care interventions on the duration of
mechanical ventilation and PICU's LOS.

NASAL CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY
PRESSURE IN SEVERE ACUTE
BRONCHIOLITIS: EVALUATION OF TIME
CONSUMPTION FOR NURSES
C Veyssiere, H Guerrini, A Louis, S Essouri,
D Devictor
Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, CHU Kremlin Bicêtre,
Kremlin Bicêtre, France
Background and Aims: Nasal continuous positive
airway pressure (NCPAP) in severe acute bronchiolitis
is now more largely use. The assistance time spent by
nurses in relation to ventilatory support either NCPAP
or tracheal ventilation was retrospectively studied.
Methods: 71 infants were included during the 2 last
epidemia (2004-2005 and 2005-2006), 42 received
NCPAP and 29 were intubated. Quantification of nurse's
act (suctioning practices, comfort and relation care) was
noted for each infant during the first 24 hours of stay.
Results: General characteristics were similar for the 2
populations with a mean age of 4.9 ± 2.3 weeks and a
mean weight of 4 ± 0.8 kilos. Requirement of suctioning
practices per day is significantly decreased in the
NCPAP group (12 ± 2 versus 31 ± 4, p<0.01). Need of
comfort care (massage and installation) per day is
significantly decreased in the NCPAP group compared
to the intubation group (6.6 ± 1.4 versus 12 ± 1.4,
p<0.01). No sedation is required during NCPAP
allowing a better infant-parent relation and setting in the
arms of parents. Length of respiratory support and stay
were reduce in the NCPAP group (p<0.002).
Conclusions: This study seems to favour a low time
spent by nurses in relation to ventilatory time during
NCPAP for severe acute bronchiolitis allowing them to
spent more time for parents-infant relation.

Paediatric and
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street
Hospital for Children NHS Trust, London, UK
Background and Aims: Conflict between health
professionals and families within the intensive care
setting is increasing. A new avenue for resolution of
potential conflicts within our unit (PICU) came via the
Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) in 2002.
Methods: We performed a review of formal complaints
to our hospital and later to PALS between 2001-2004.
Point of contact and reason for contact and outcome
were reviewed.
Results: Between 2001-4 our hospital received 542
formal complaints. Referrals to PALS were 470 for the
period 2002-4 of which 32 were in respect of intensive
care, 9 (3.54%) in 2001-2 dropping to 3 in 2002-3
(1.67%) and 2 in 2003-4 after the arrival of PALS.
Content of complaints about PICU altered significantly
after arrival of PALS.
Conclusions: A liaison service can become an intergral
part of intensive care working alongside the medical and
nursing staff to improve communication and family
satisfaction. Cases involving end of life care and
treatment decisions may on occasion cause significant
conflict for staff and families. An approach based on
impartial mediation meets the needs of the family and
staff and can prove significantly successful in the de-
escalation and resolution of conflicts and the subsequent
reduction of complaints received.
TOWARDS DEBRIEFING ON THE PICU!
O Stoffels, J Reuselaars, R J Houmes, A van den Bos,
I van 't Wout, D Tibboel, M van Dijk
Pediatric Surgical Intensive Care Unit, Erasmus MC-
Sophia, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: Critical Incident Stress
Debriefing (CISD), was developed in 1983 to manage
stress for workers in high risk workplaces such as the
emergency room. CISD sessions help participants: (1) to
verbalize distress; (2) to form appropriate concepts
about stress reactions before false interpretations of the
experience are formed; and (3) to return to routine
functioning. Debriefing has not yet gained ground in
pediatric intensive care despite high incidences of
distressing and acute situations. To determine the need
- 384 -
for debriefing, we asked our PICU caregivers to assess
stressful incidents in which they had been involved.
Methods: Caregivers completed a six-item
questionnaire after watching videotaped material of
incidents in which they had participated, such as
resuscitation during ECMO and care of a patient with
neurotrauma. The questionnaire included closed
questions about communication, safety and negative
emotions afterwards. Total score could range from 0 (no
impact) to 18 (serious impact of incident).
Results: Eighteen questionnaires were returned from
twelve nurses and six physicians. Thirteen respondents
(72%) agreed that there had been stress/turmoil on the
ward. Ten respondents (61%) judged division of roles as
unclear. Seven reported ineffective communication
(39%), and three unsafety (17%). Median total score
was 6.5 for physicians and 7.5 for nurses.
Conclusions: This questionnaire could be valuable to
evaluate the impact of incidents in the PICU
environment, both on nurses and physicians. More data
are required to confirm these findings and to determine
elements (severity of illness or collaboration in the
team) of greatest impact.
EVELINA CHILDRENS HOSPITAL (ECH): A
NEW PAEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE (PICU)
D C A Mangani, T J Fox
PICU, Forest Ward, Evelina Childrens Hospital,
London, UK
Background and Aims: Guy's & St Thomas PICU have
been based at Guy's site for the past 20 years. Finally on
the 17th October 2005 they moved into a new location
to the new children's hospital at the St Thomas site
which is the beginning of a new era for PICU.
Methods: The aim of this presentation is to concentrate
on the planning involved in moving an entire
department from one hospital to another and to show the
benefits PICU have gained since moving from a 12
funded bed unit to a 20 bedded unit which is now all
located on the same floor (previously on two floors) and
in close proximity to cardiac theatres and others
departments. The move was performed in one day with
in-house South Thames Retrieval Service.
Results: Advantages state of the art medical equipment
(pendants, monitoring) PICU located on the same floor.
In close proximity to Cardiac Theatres and recovery.
South Thames Retrieval Service operating within PICU.
Effective communication and control of medical
equipment (wireless).
Conclusions: The patients and the PICU can only
benefit from having a new unit which is in close
proximity to other essential departments with a unit
which has been specifically designed to make life easier.

Children’s Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Background and Aims: The Neonatal Intensive Care
Unit (NICU) was the last intensive care unit of the
Erasmus MC - Sophia Children’s Hospital, which had to
implement the Patient Data Management System
(PDMS). The aim is to work with a PDMS-template that
covers the complete nursing record and part of the
medical record of the patients in the NICU.
Methods: In the development of a PDMS-template for
the NICU, the PDMS-template of the PICU was
reviewed for its usage and compatibility of the NICU
care processes. The advantage of using the PICU-
template might save time and the administrative
differences between the NICU and the PICU might be
reduced to a better cooperation between healthcare
professionals of both units. A group of 2 physicians, 1
nurse practitioner and 17 nurses were trained in the
PDMS programme. The professionals placed the data of
30 neonates in the PICU-template and concluded that
many specific items could not be placed in this template.
Results: The data for the neonatal population missing in
the PICU-template were for example: Gestational age,
weights, accuracy of calculations and treatments. The
professionals advised to make a separate NICU-template
and a list of recommendations was established based
upon the experiences of the 30 neonatal cases. Based on
these recommendations, the system administrator made
a specific NICU-template.
Conclusions: It is not possible to convert the current
PICU-template of the PDMS into a NICU-template. The
PICU-template can be used as a basic template to
develop a specific NICU-template.

Background and Aims: Appropriate feeding,
immunization and periodic health controls have an
impact on pediatric health care. The aim of this study
was to assess protective behaviour of families with
children between the age of 0-16 years concerning
immunization, nutrition and periodic health care.
Methods: Inclusion criteria for this cross- sectional,
descriptive study were, having child/ children between
the age of 0-16 years, sharing the same domicile with
them, giving informed consent to participate in the
study. The study group (n=368) was randomly selected
among mothers fulfilling the above criteria. Data were
collected during one year between February 2003-2005.
For socio-demographic inquiry a semistructured
questionnaire consisting of 19 questions was used. After
test-retest procedures these 10 items likert scale (1=low
importance, 10=utmost importance) questions were used
- 385 -
to assess mothers' attitudes towards their offsprings'
immunization, nutrition, and periodic health care.
Results: The scores for immunization (9.4±1.2) was
leading, nutrition (8.5±1.4) and periodic health care
(8.2±1.6) were found relatively less important by the
mothers. The attributed importance to nutrition and
periodic health care was significantly increasing with
higher education levels (r=0.34, p<0.001; r=0.24,
p<0.001, respectively) while there was no correlation
with immunization and mothers' education level (r=0.1,
p=0.06).
Conclusions: In spite of globalization children are still
dying due to malnutrition and preventable diseases in
the world. Families should be educated in terms of child
care emphasizing the importance of nutrition,
immunization and periodic health care. This study
suggests that childhood vaccines are well known and
appreciated by mothers of all levels of education.

Background and Aims: Feeding dies suggest that
feeding tolerance is better in preterm infants fed formulas
containing hydrolyzed whey proteins. However, concern
also exists about the biologic value of such formula. We
speculated that tolerance, and, therefore, growth would be
better in preterm infants fed hydrolyzed whey-based
formula when compared to a standard preterm infant
formula.
Methods: In a single-center, double-blind randomized
controlled trial, infants weighing < or = 1750g at birth, <
or = 34 weeks gestation, and tolerating 150cc/k/day
enterally for >24 hours were randomized to receive
standard premature infant formula (Group A) or a
premature infant formula containing 100% hydrolyzed
whey protein (Group B) for 3 weeks. Anthropometry and
blood chemistries (BUN, total protein, albumin) were
determined at the beginning of the study and weekly
thereafter. At the end of the study, plasma amino acids,
fatty acids, transferrin, and retinol binding protein were
also determined. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-
treat basis and a per protocol basis. According to data
distribution, a difference in weight gain of 3 g/d would be
significant. Primary outcome was weight gain; secondary
outcomes were feeding tolerance and gains in length and
head circumference.
Results: Of the 80 infants enrolled, 74 completed the
study; 2 were never started due to age, 2 were lost to
follow-up, and 2 were lost due to sepsis, 1 of whom had
NEC. Two infants (1 from each group)were dropped
from the per protocol data due to lack of compliance but
were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. No
significant difference was found between treatment
groups for demographics, protocol compliance, or gains
in weight (0.9g/d difference, p 0.54) length (0.434mm/wk
difference, p 0.51), or head circumference (0.328mm/wk,
p 0.44). There were 2 episodes of feeding intolerance, 1
in each group. Two adverse events (1 NEC, Group A; 1
GBS sepsis, Group B) were also equally distributed.
Conclusions: Preterm infants fed hydrolyzed whey
protein-based formula have equivalent growth compared
to preterm infants fed standard non-hydrolyzed whey-
casein based formula.
