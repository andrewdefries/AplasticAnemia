Summary
Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a syndrome characterized by a
severe normocytic anaemia, reticulocytopenia, and absence of
erythroblasts from an otherwise normal bone marrow. Primary
PRCA, or secondary PRCA which has not responded to
treatment of the underlying disease, is treated as an immuno-
logically-mediated disease. Although vigorous immunosup-
pressive treatments induce and maintain remissions in a
majority of patients, they carry an increased risk of serious
complications. Corticosteroids were used in the treatment of
PRCA and this has been considered the treatment of ﬁrst
choice although relapse is not uncommon. Cyclosporine A
(CsA) has become established as one of the leading drugs for
treatment of PRCA. However, common concerns have been
the number of patients treated with CsA who achieve sustained
remissions and the number that relapse. This article reviews
the current status of CsA therapy and compares it to other
treatments for diverse PRCAs.

Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), a disorder ﬁrst characterized in
1922 (Kaznelson, 1922), is a syndrome characterized by severe
normochromic, normocytic anaemia associated with reticulo-
cytopenia and absence of erythroblasts from an otherwise
normal bone marrow. PRCA may appear as a congenital
disorder or occur as an acquired syndrome. The acquired form
of PRCA presents either as an acute self-limited disease,
predominantly seen in children, or as a chronic illness that is
more frequently seen in adults. It may present as a primary
haematological disorder in the absence of any other disease, or
secondary to parvovirus infection, collagen vascular disease,
leukaemia, lymphoma, thymoma, solid tumors, treatment with
recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) or other drugs,
ABO-incompatible haematopoietic stem cell transplantation
and pregnancy. Depending on the cause, the course can be
acute and self-limiting or chronic with rare spontaneous
remissions (Dessypris, 1988; Dessypris & Lipton, 2004).
Primary, or secondary PRCA not responding to treatment of
the underlying diseases, is treated as an immunologically-
mediated disease, based on a number of studies implicating a
pathological role of serum auto-antibodies, natural killer (NK)
cell-mediated or T lymphocyte-mediated effects impairing
various stages and mechanisms of erythropoiesis as extensively
reviewed by Fisch et al (2000). The major objective in the
treatment of PRCA is to induce a remission with the recovery
of erythropoiesis, thus providing relief from transfusions and
avoiding transfusion-associated problems. The therapeutic
plan usually focuses on the sequential use of various immu-
nosuppressive therapies until a remission is obtained. Remis-
sions have been achieved by treatment with corticosteroids
(CS), cyclophosphamide (CY), cyclosporine A (CsA), anti-
thymocyte globulin (ATG), splenectomy, and plasmapheresis
(Dessypris & Lipton, 2004). More recently, the efﬁcacies of the
anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab (Zecca et al,
2001), and anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, alemtuzumab
(Willis et al, 2001), to induce remissions of therapy-resistant
PRCA have also been reported.
In general, remission can be easily achieved in the majority
of patients. To date, the efﬁcacy of CS, CY and CsA for patients
with primary or secondary PRCA has been reported to be
between 30–62%, 7–20% and 65–87%, respectively (Clark
et al, 1984; Dessypris, 1988; Raghavachar, 1990; Marmont,
1991; Lacy et al, 1996; Mamiya et al, 1997). The efﬁcacy of a
combination of CY and CS for refractory patients has been
reported to be between 40–60% (Clark et al, 1984; Dessypris,
1988, Mamiya et al, 1997). Since the initial cases were
successfully treated by Totterman et al (1984), CsA has
established itself as one of the leading drugs for the treatment

of PRCA. However, concern has centred around the precise
number of patients treated with CsA who achieve a sustained
remission and the number who relapse. In 1988, Dessypris
pointed out that treatment of PRCA with CsA appeared to be
very promising, but that such treatment should be considered
still experimental, and that further studies were necessary to
determine the effectiveness of this drug, the optimal and least
toxic dosage, the minimum duration of therapy for induction
of remission, and whether or not there was a need for
maintenance treatment (Dessypris, 1988). An advantage of CsA
therapy for PRCA has long remained unclear, as comparing
one therapeutic approach to another has been almost impos-
sible because the disease is so rare that controlled studies could
not be performed. However, the number of patients treated
with CsA has accumulated over two decades, which made it
possible to conduct an analytical study. The present paper
reviews the current status of CsA therapy, comparing it to
other treatments for the diverse types of acquired PRCA except
for transient erythroblastopenia of childhood.
Diagnosis and initial evaluation
Pure red cell aplasia in adults can be easily diagnosed when
isolated anaemia, in the presence of normal white cell and
platelet counts, is associated with a marrow of normal
cellularity in which there is an almost complete absence of
erythroblasts but normal myeloid cells and megakaryocytes
(Dessypris & Lipton, 2004). The classiﬁcation of the clinical
course (acute or chronic) and pathogenesis, such as secondary
or idiopathic (no deﬁnite underlying disease) is essential to
select the optimal therapeutic modality. Evaluations for the
possible causes of PRCA should include a previous history of
drug use and toxins or infections, liver and kidney functions,
immunological examination including auto-antibodies, a bone
marrow examination including morphology, chromosome and
rearrangement of T cell receptor (TCR) analysis, peripheral-
blood ﬂow cytometry, virological examination including
parvovirus B19 DNA, and computed tomography and/or
magnetic resonance imaging examinations to rule out the
presence of thymoma and neoplasms.
Today, a careful assessment of the increase of large granular
lymphocytes (LGLs) is especially critical and an analysis of
immunophenotype and TCR rearrangement of lymphocytes
may be essential for ruling out LGL leukaemia, also referred
to as granular lymphocyte proliferative disorders (GLPD)
(Oshimi et al, 1993) or lymphoproliferative disease of gran-
ular lymphocytes (LDGL) (Go et al, 2001). LGL leukaemia
was the most common underlying disease of secondary PRCA
in a single institutional study from the United States, and the
second most common cause in Japan (Lacy et al, 1996;
Mamiya et al, 1997; Sawada et al, 2007). Since the diagnosis
of LGL leukemia is somewhat difﬁcult in patients without
lymphocytosis, this group of patients can be misdiagnosed as
idiopathic PRCA although LGL leukemia-associated PRCA
may require a different treatment for the primary disease. It is
a heterogeneous disorder characterized by a persistent
increase in the number of peripheral blood LGLs, and the
majority of patients have a clonal rearrangement of T-cell
receptors (Oshimi et al, 1993; Semenzato et al, 1997; Chan
et al, 2001). Clonal disorders of LGLs arise from either
mature T lymphocytes or NK cells, and may be indolent or
behave as an aggressive disease. T-cell LGL leukaemia is the
most common form of clonal LGL disorders and most cases
behave in an indolent fashion. Neutropenia is the most
frequent cytopenia in T-cell LGL leukaemia, and anaemia
occurs in 48% of the patients (Loughran, 1993; Lamy &
Loughran, 1998, 2003).
The evidence of a granular lymphocytosis greater than
2 · 109
/l lasting for more than 6 months has been regarded as
the criteria for deﬁning the disease (Loughran & Starkebaum,
1987; Semenzato et al, 1987; Oshimi, 1988). However, the
normal range for peripheral blood LGL counts is
0Æ223 ± 0Æ099 · 109
/l (Loughran et al, 1987) and clonal disease
has been documented in 8% of patients when absolute LGL
counts are between 0Æ6 to 1Æ0 · 109
/l (Loughran, 1993). Thus,
an expansion of a restricted LGL subset demonstrates the
diagnosis of LGL-leukaemia and a 6-month follow-up criterion
is not necessary when clonality is established (Semenzato et al,
1997). The characteristic ﬁnding is the presence of increased
numbers of LGL, usually identiﬁed by a greater size than
normal lymphocytes, abundant pale cytoplasm, and prominent
azurophilic granules. However, these features may vary, even
among cells from the same patient (Loughran, 1993). The
granulation can range from ﬁne to coarse, and some cells may
have otherwise characteristic features but lack granules
(sometimes called large agranular lymphocytes) (Bassan et al,
1986). Occasionally, clonally expanded lymphocytes with a
characteristic CD3+
, CD57+
phenotype may not have LGL
morphology on a peripheral smear (Ahern et al, 1990) but may
represent in vivo antigen-activated cytotoxic effector T cells. An
increase of CD3+
/CD56)
or CD3)
/CD56+
cells by peripheral-
blood ﬂow cytometry and/or an inverted CD4+
/CD8+
cell ratio
(<1Æ0) suggests the existence of LGL leukaemia (Gonzales-
Chambers et al, 1992).
Initial management
During the initial evaluation, red cell transfusions can be given
as necessary. In cases supposed to be primary idiopathic
PRCA, it would be preferable to wait for at least a month
before instituting speciﬁc treatment, with the rationale that
10–12% of PRCA patients run a short and self-limited course
(Dessypris, 1988). If, after such a waiting period, no signs of
recovery of erythropoiesis appear, speciﬁc treatment should be
instituted. Many of the secondary PRCAs are due to drugs and
disappear when the drug is stopped. Those secondary to
parvovirus B19 can be treated with intravenous immunoglob-
ulin. Secondary PRCA not responding to treatment of the
underlying diseases and primary PRCA are treated as immu-
nologically-mediated diseases.

Immunosuppressive therapy
Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids (CS) were the ﬁrst immunosuppressive drugs
used in the treatment of PRCA and so far have been considered
the treatment of ﬁrst choice, especially in young adults (Clark
et al, 1984; Dessypris, 1988; Charles et al, 1996; Dessypris &
Lipton, 2004). The details of CS therapy are described elsewhere
(Dessypris, 1988; Dessypris & Lipton, 2004). In an era when
CsA was not yet available, Clark et al (1984) reported the largest
series of PRCA patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy
and showed that 10/27 (37%) patients with acquired PRCA
responded to CS within a mean period of 2Æ5 weeks. Compa-
rable results of CS treatment were obtained at other institu-
tions, ranging from 30–62% (Dessypris, 1988; Raghavachar,
1990; Marmont, 1991; Lacy et al, 1996; Mamiya et al, 1997).
One of the important drawbacks of CS is that relapse is not
uncommon: 80% of patients relapsed, as the dosage was
tapered, during the 24 months after remission (Clark et al,
1984). The principal reason for discontinuing the drug, despite
subsequent recurrence of anaemia, was the presence of
unacceptable side effects, such as myopathy, infection, hyper-
glycemia, and compression fractures at the dose required to
maintain remission. Treatment of relapses was successful, with
10/13 (77%) patients entering a second or third remission, and
the median survival in patients with primary idiopathic PRCA
was 14 years (Clark et al, 1984). Cytotoxic drugs administered
in combination with CS were the most effective form of
treatment in this study, producing 18/32 (56%) remissions.
Although such vigorous immunosuppressive treatment is
capable of inducing and maintaining remission in a majority
of patients, it carries increased risks of serious infections,
malignancy, and sterility (Clark et al, 1984). Thus, an individ-
ualized approach to management of PRCA has been widely
accepted, i.e. escalating therapy in proportion to the severity of
the disease for those patients who have failed CS therapy.
Cyclosporin A
Raghavachar (1990) reviewed the treatment of PRCA, focusing
on the results of cyclosporin A (CsA) therapy, in 43 patients.
He showed that the overall response rate to CsA is excellent
(65%) and proposed that CsA should be the ﬁrst drug to be
given in acquired PRCA. Of note is that a high dosage was used
in order to obtain these results (12 mg/kg per day). Compa-
rable results of CsA treatment have been obtained at other
institutions, ranging from 65–87% (Dessypris, 1988; Marmont,
1991; Means et al, 1991; Lacy et al, 1996; Mamiya et al, 1997;
Sawada et al, 2007). Mamiya et al (1997) reviewed the clinical
features of 150 patients with acquired PRCA in Japan. In their
surveillance, CsA was given to 38 patients in a daily dose of
200–600 mg (most often 200–300 mg) and 31 (82%) showed
haematological recovery. The response rate to CsA was 87% in
the patients with primary PRCA and 73% in those with
secondary PRCA, which encouraged them to recommend CsA
therapy as ﬁrst-line therapy for this disease.
Recently, The Japan PRCA Collaborative Study Group
conducted a nationwide survey in Japan between 1990 and
2006 (Sawada et al, 2007). From a total of 185 patients,
consisting of 73 primary idiopathic and 112 secondary PRCA
cases, 62 patients with primary idiopathic PRCA were evalu-
ated, which is the largest and the longest follow-up study so
far. Although a retrospective one, this study, for the ﬁrst time,
answered many of the unknown questions concerning CsA
therapy. The remission induction therapies for these patients
by CsA and CS produced remissions in 74% and 60% of
patients, respectively. The initial dose of CsA for the respond-
ing patients was 4Æ8 ± 1Æ2 mg/kg (mean ± SD, n = 23) with a
range of 2Æ9–7Æ6 mg/kg body weight. Patients treated with
CsA alone (n = 23) became transfusion-independent by
82 ± 200 d, with a range up to 910 d, after the start of
therapy. Fifteen patients (65%) achieved transfusion-indepen-
dence within 2 weeks, 17 patients (74%) within 1 month and
18 patients (78%) within 3 months. Salvage immunosuppres-
sive treatment achieved remissions in 58 patients (94%).
Forty-one and 15 patients were maintained on CsA ± CS
(CsA-containing group) or CS alone (CS-group), respectively.
The median relapse-free survival (RFS; estimated as trans-
fusion-free survival) in the CsA-containing group was
103 months, signiﬁcantly longer (P < 0Æ01) than that seen in
the CS-group (33 months). Thus, combined CsA therapy can
sustain a longer duration of initial remission than CS, however,
discontinuation of maintenance therapy was strongly corre-
lated with relapse (P < 0Æ001) and caused relapses with a
median of 3 months with a range of 1Æ5–40 months. In
contrast, 88% of relapses in the CS-group occurred during
maintenance prednisolone (PSL) therapy (Sawada et al, 2007).
To¨tterman et al (1989) also reported that PRCA patients did
not remain in remission after CsA was stopped. An important
question is whether or not the maintenance of patients in
remission may have a beneﬁcial inﬂuence on survival. One
study (Sawada et al, 2007) reported an estimated median OS of
the CsA-containing group of 12 years, which was not signif-
icantly different than the CS-group, while the 10-year OS in all
patients was 95% and the median OS had not yet been reached
in all patients. Of importance is the fact that the CsA is
required to maintain remissions (Sawada et al, 2007) and the
decreased probability of relapse and requirement of red cell
transfusions reduces the dangers of hemolysis, infections and
iron overload with possible superoxide damage to body tissues.
CsA is more expensive than CS and requires renal function to
be monitored, but it seems to be important to prevent relapses
and to sustain remissions in primary idiopathic PRCA.
Although higher doses of CsA, such as 12 mg/kg per day have
been used for patients with PRCA (Raghavachar, 1990), this
dosage has been toxic for Japanese PRCA patients. Since
cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes, involved in CsA metabolism,
have a variable frequency of a reduced function allele
depending on race and each individual (Bladford, 2004), the

most important therapeutic index should be trough CsA levels.
Caucasian patients with anti-EPO antibody-related PRCA have
been successfully treated with CsA alone at a dose of 200 mg/d
(or 100 mg twice daily) (Verhelst et al, 2004; Rossert et al,
2005). Since organ transplantations have shown that long-term
immunosuppression is associated with post-transplant
malignancies (Cattran et al, 1995; Young et al, 2006), contin-
uous and careful follow-up is required for patients receiving
long-term CsA therapy.
Cytotoxic immunosuppressive drugs
Patients with an absolute contraindication for CsA or patients
refractory to CsA may be treated with CS or a combination of
CS and other immunosuppressives. Cyclophosphamide (CY)
has been the principal alkylating agent utilized as an immuno-
suppressive drug in PRCA. The details of CY therapy are
described elsewhere (Dessypris, 1988; Dessypris & Lipton,
2004). The initial dosage of CY is 50 mg/d p.o. and PSL at a
dose of 20–30 mg/d is added in the absence of any contrain-
dication. If the white blood cell and platelet counts allow, it is
increased by 50 mg weekly or biweekly to a maximum of
150 mg daily until remission occurs or bone marrow suppres-
sion develops. The mean time to response is approximately 11
to 12 weeks with an overall response rate of 40 to 60%. When
response occurs, the dose of PSL is tapered, and then the dose of
CY is progressively decreased and eventually discontinued after
3–4 months from the time of normalization of haematocrit.
The duration of remission induced by CY seems to be
prolonged as compared to remissions induced by CS (Clark
et al, 1984; Firkin & Maher, 1988; Go et al, 2001). LGL
leukaemia-associated PRCA has been primarily treated with
chemotherapy, such as CY with or without CS, CsA, CS or
methotrexate (Dhodapkar et al, 1994; Loughran et al, 1994;
Lacy et al, 1996; Yamada et al, 1997; Sood et al, 1998;
Hamidou et al, 2000; Go et al, 2001; Battiwalla et al, 2003;
Osuji et al, 2006). The combination of CY plus CS is associated
with a longer duration of response than CS alone (Dhodapkar
et al, 1994; Lacy et al, 1996; Go et al, 2001). The overall
response to initial CY ± CS therapy has been reported to be 66
to 100 % (Yamada et al, 1997; Go et al, 2003) and the median
duration of response is 32 months (Go et al, 2003).
In one study, none of the patients with a response to
cytotoxic agents had relapses (Lacy et al, 1996), but the other
studies reported that a substantial number of patients relapsed
when the CY was withdrawn (Zaentz et al, 1976; Clark et al,
1984). Maintenance CY therapy may prevent relapse, however,
recognition of a variety of toxicities, particularly concerns
about the long-term risk of malignancy and gonadal toxicity,
often lead clinicians to consider less toxic alternative medica-
tions whenever possible (Csuka et al, 1986; Hoffman et al,
1992). These toxicity risks from alkylating agents are related to
the cumulative dose of the medication (Reinhold-Keller et al,
2000) and the duration of therapy (Radis et al, 1995). Thus,
the best role of CY therapy for PRCA might be to induce
remissions using oral treatment lasting not longer than six
months, with a switch to less toxic medication, such as CsA,
for maintenance, but no controlled studies exist and this is
purely speculative. It has been reported that crossover to
azathioprine was effective in patients initially unresponsive to
CY and vice versa (Firkin & Maher, 1988).
Anti-thymocyte globulin
In the largest series of nine PRCA patients treated with anti-
thymocyte globulin (ATG) at a dose of 15 mg/kg per day for
10 d, six responded to therapy, ﬁve with normal haematocrits
and one with a stable haematocrit of 32% (Abkowitz et al,
1986). Three remained in complete remission and two
relapsed, which suggests that ATG is an effective form of
treatment. However, this is an expensive and conﬁning therapy
that requires hospitalization because of a possible anaphylactic
reaction.
Alemtuzumab
The anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab (Cam-
path-1H) is a humanized IgG1j monoclonal antibody directed
against the CD52 antigen, present on B and T lymphocytes,
NK cells, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells and eosino-
phils but not on human haemopoietic stem cells (Hale, 2001).
The rationale behind the use of alemtuzumab in refractory
cytopenias is that T-lymphocytes are thought to play an
important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune cytopenias,
as they are involved in the control of expansion of immuno-
globulin-producing, auto-reactive B-lymphocyte clones (Willis
et al, 2001). Willis et al (2001) reported the effect of treatment
with alemtuzumab followed by CsA administration in 21
patients with severe and life-threatening autoimmune cytope-
nias including four patients with PRCA. A response was seen in
2/4 patients with PRCA, although one patient relapsed at
7 months when the CsA blood level was suboptimal. One
patient with PRCA in association with low-grade non-Hodg-
kin lymphoma died from high-grade transformation at
16 months while still in remission from the PRCA. Ru and
Liebman (2003) reported two patients with chronic lympho-
cytic leukaemia (CLL) and a CD8 T-LGL leukaemia who were
refractory to multiple treatments for PRCA. When both
patients were treated with alemtuzumab, there was a rapid
increase in the reticulocyte count that occurred as early as the
third infusion. At the time reporting, both patients had been in
PRCA remission for 9 and 5 months, respectively. These
results indicated that alemtuzumab is an alternative option in
the treatment of patients with refractory PRCA, however,
relapse can occur and a signiﬁcant number of patients need
maintenance therapy with CsA after alemtuzumab treatment.
Therefore, it remains uncertain whether alemtuzumab can
induce a maintenance-free haematological response in PRCA.
The use of alemutuzumab should be limited to patients with
PRCA who are refractory to conventional immunosuppressive

therapy because of the limited information and high risk of
infections.
Rituximab
Rituximab is a genetically engineered chimeric mouse/human
monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 molecule present
on mature B cells, which are the precursors of autoantibody-
producing plasma cells. Rituximab can selectively deplete
B-cells by mechanisms including antibody-dependent cell-
mediated cytotoxicity, complement-mediated cytotoxicity and
inhibition of cell proliferation with direct induction of B-cell
apoptosis (Smith, 2003). Rituximab has been found to be useful
in treating primary autoimmune hemolytic anaemia and
thrombocytopenia (Quartier et al, 2001; Stasi et al, 2001) and
several reports have shown that PRCA was successfully treated
with rituximab in patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative
disorders mainly consisting of CLL (Batlle et al, 2002; Ghazal,
2002; Gupta et al, 2002; Hegde et al, 2002; Ru & Liebman,
2003; Pantelidou et al, 2004; Narra et al, 2006). The maximum
time for onset of response was 4 weeks. In two cases, where
PRCA and the primary disorder were simultaneously diag-
nosed, rituximab led to response in both PRCA and the primary
disorder (Narra et al, 2006). One patient had a response to
rituximab lasting only 4 weeks, but then responded to
alemtuzumab (Ru & Liebman, 2003). No signiﬁcant side effects
were reported in any of these patients treated with rituximab.
Dungarwalla et al (2007) have shown that the results of
rituximab therapy in patients with severe, resistant and life-
threatening PRCA refractory to conventional immunosuppres-
sion are disappointing. In their pilot study, all three of these
patients with idiopathic PRCA did not respond to a conven-
tional dose of rituximab (375 mg/m2
) weekly for 4 weeks.
Other therapeutic options
Intravenous immunoglobulin
In immunocompromised hosts, such as recipients of organ
transplantation (Wong et al, 1999), patients infected with
human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) (Frickhofen et al, 1990)
or receiving chemotherapy (Song et al, 2002; Isobe et al, 2004),
acute or chronic anaemia can develop following parvovirus
B19 infection due to the lack of the production of speciﬁc
antibodies. Chronic B19 infection-related PRCA is a treatable
anaemia and demonstration of the virus DNA in blood by the
polymerase chain reaction or dot-blot hybridization assays is
essential. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) contains neu-
tralizing antibody against parvovirus B19 and has been
reported to be effective for chronic B19 infection-related
anaemia in immunocompromised hosts. Recurrence of anae-
mia is common in HIV-infected patients with low CD4+
T-cell
counts (<0Æ08  0Æ1 · 109
/l) and requires additional IVIG
(Ramratnam et al, 1995). Anti-retroviral therapy may resolve
chronic anaemia in HIV-infected patients (Mylonakis et al,
1999). IVIG may also be effective for PRCA due to parvovirus
B19 in patients treated with rituximab (Sharma et al, 2000;
Song et al, 2002). Alemtuzumab causes prolonged, severe CD4
and CD8 lymphopenia (Keating et al, 2002) and PRCA due to
parvovirus B19 infection in a patient with cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma treated with alemtuzumab has been reported
(Herbert et al, 2003). Tacrolimus (FK506) is often associated
with chronic B19 infection-associated anaemia in organ
transplant recipients and cessation of tacrolimus or replace-
ment with other immunosuppressants results in an improve-
ment of anaemia (Wong et al, 1999).
Thymectomy
Surgical resection of thymomas has been recommended as the
initial treatment of thymoma-associated PRCA, with an
expected haematological response rate of 25–30% (Zeok et al,
1979). In recent reports, resection of the thymoma by itself was
effective in remitting the anaemia in only a small percentage of
patients (Mamiya et al, 1997; Thompson & Steensma, 2006)
and a signiﬁcant fraction of patients developed PRCA after
thymectomy (Suzuki et al, 2003; Thompson & Steensma, 2006;
Hirokawa et al, 2008). Although the pathogenesis of thymo-
ma-associated PRCA remains to be elucidated, there exist two
potential mechanisms. Thymoma itself alters the subset and/or
the repertoires of T lymphocytes, leading to the production of
autoaggressive T-cell clones (Hoffacker et al, 2000). Another
intriguing possibility is that thymectomy may represent a risk
for the development of systemic autoimmune disorders over
years (Gerli et al, 1999).
Thompson and Steensma (2006) reported that surgical
resection of thymoma was insufﬁcient for normalization of
erythropoiesis in all 13 patients so treated, but immunosup-
pressive therapy was effective as an adjuvant treatment.
Immunosuppressive therapy including CS, CY and CsA has
been reported to be useful in cases with thymoma-associated
PRCA (Marmont et al, 1975; Garcia Vela et al, 1993; Charles
et al, 1996; Thompson & Steensma, 2006), but optimal
management of this disorder has remained unclear. Recently,
it has been reported that thymoma-associated PRCA showed
an excellent response to CsA and CsA-containing regiments
were effective in preventing relapse (Hirokawa et al, 2008).
Splenectomy, plasmapheresis, and bone marrow transplan-
tation have been used on rare occasions and can be tried if all
else fails.
Peptide-based EPO receptor agonist
Krantz and Kao (1967), for the ﬁrst time, reported that plasma
from a patient with PRCA inhibited haem synthesis by the
patient’s own bone marrow cells in vitro. The serum of patients
with anti- EPO antibody-related PRCA also inhibited the
growth of erythroid progenitor cells in vitro (Casadevall et al,
2002). PRCA due to autoantibodies against endogenous EPO
occurs but is rare in patients who have never been treated with

recombinant human EPO (rhEPO). rhEPO-related PRCA
reached a peak incidence mainly in Europe in 2001 to 2002,
largely related to a change of formulation, and of uncoated
rubber stoppers (leachates present), in a particular rhEPO
product, Eprex, and subcutaneous administration (Casadevall
et al, 2002; Rossert et al, 2004).
The two most important initial steps in the management of
anti-EPO antibody-mediated PRCA are transfusions for
symptomatic anaemia and stopping the administration of
rhEPO (Rossert et al, 2004). Since PRCA in this setting is
immune-mediated, and since spontaneous remissions after
cessation of rhEPO therapy are rare, immunosuppressive
therapy should be provided in most cases (Verhelst et al, 2004;
Rossert et al, 2005). Anti-rhEPO antibodies cross-react not
only with the endogenous hormone, but also with all rhEPO
molecules, including darbepoetin alfa (Casadevall et al, 2002).
Rechallenge with rhEPO preparations may cause an anamnes-
tic antibody response, making it less possible for the antibody
to either spontaneously disappear or return to clinically
unimportant levels, and may induce the formation of allergic
skin and systemic reactions (Weber et al, 2002).
Recently, a novel peptide-based EPO receptor agonist called
Hematide, which does not cross-react with anti-EPO antibod-
ies, has been developed (Stead et al, 2006). Hematide is a
synthetic, dimeric peptidic erythropoiesis-stimulating agent
covalently linked to polyethylene glycol and is being developed
for the treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal
failure and cancer. Because its primary amino acid sequence is
unrelated to that of rhEPO, Hematide is unlikely to induce a
cross-reactive immune response against endogenous EPO and
is reported to correct anaemia induced by anti-rhEPO
antibodies in a rat PRCA model (Woodburn et al, 2007).

Thus, a recent animal study suggested that a possible
alternative strategy might be to administer Hematide to
patients with PRCA due to anti-rhEPO antibodies, which
should enable ongoing stimulation of erythropoiesis.
Future prospects: proposal for a ﬁrst-line therapy in
primary acquired PRCA
There are several options for inducing remission of PRCA, but
many patients with acquired PRCA require immunosuppres-
sive therapy to maintain remissions. As summarized in Table I,
CS, CsA and CY plus CS are almost equally effective for
inducing remissions of PRCA, but the most important
difference between these agents is the feasibility of long-term
maintenance. Although the relapsed patients can be re-treated
with the same agents, such as CS or CS plus CY, the cumulative
side effects and toxicity become unacceptable. Considering the
recurrent nature of acquired PRCA, we suggest CsA as ﬁrst-
line therapy for these patients at a dose of 2Æ5–3 mg/kg twice
daily to achieve trough CsA levels of 150–250 ng/ml for a
maximum of three to four months. This trough CsA level has
been empirically determined according to a consensus from a
multicentre randomized study in Japan for aplastic anaemia
(Teramura et al, 2007). Maintenance therapy with CsA is a
requisite for most patients to prevent relapse. Since nephro-
toxicity constitutes the major limiting side effect of CsA,
careful and progressive decrease of the dosage to the minimum
required for maintenance of remission is appropriate. The
mean maintenance dose of CsA in Japanese patients who were
continuing their ﬁrst remission for more than 24 months was
2Æ2 ± 0Æ8 mg/kg per day with a range of 1Æ1–3Æ8 mg/kg per day,
40% of the initial dose (Sawada et al, 2007), which suggests
difﬁculty in reducing CsA under this dosage to maintain
remissions. Adequate prevention and treatment of infections
secondary to immunosuppression are also necessary for
successful management of these patients.
