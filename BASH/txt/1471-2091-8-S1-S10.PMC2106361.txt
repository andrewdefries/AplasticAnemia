Abstract
Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by aplastic anemia, cancer/leukemia
susceptibility and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, such as cisplatin. To date, 12
FA gene products have been identified, which cooperate in a common DNA damage-activated
signaling pathway regulating DNA repair (the FA pathway). Eight FA proteins form a nuclear
complex harboring E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (the FA core complex) that, in response to DNA
damage, mediates the monoubiquitylation of the FA protein FANCD2. Monoubiquitylated
FANCD2 colocalizes in nuclear foci with proteins involved in DNA repair, including BRCA1,
FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCN/PALB2 and RAD51. All these factors are required for cellular
resistance to DNA crosslinking agents. The inactivation of the FA pathway has also been observed
in a wide variety of human cancers and is implicated in the sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA
crosslinking agents. Drugs that inhibit the FA pathway may be useful chemosensitizers in the
treatment of cancer.

Protein pathway in the disease
Fanconi anemia
Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal or X-linked reces-
sive disease characterized by chromosomal instability and
cancer susceptibility. All FA complementation groups
(discussed below) except FA-B are inherited autosomally
[1,2]. FA prevalence is estimated to be 1–5 per million and
the frequency of heterozygous carriers to be 1 in 300 [3,4].
Notwithstanding the small number of FA patients, this
disease constitutes a dynamic research area because the FA
pathway plays a crucial role in preventing genomic insta-
bility and provides an attractive model for understanding
the interplay between DNA repair and ubiquitin biology
in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy (reviewed in [5-15]).
The clinical course and the treatment of FA have been
extensively reviewed elsewhere [3,4,16]. Clinically, FA is
characterized by childhood onset aplastic anemia,
increased cancer/leukemia susceptibility and develop-
mental defects. Typically, FA patients develop bone mar-
row failure leading to aplastic anemia during the first
decade of life and at least 20% develop malignancies.
Most commonly, these include acute myelogenous leuke-
mia and myelodysplastic syndrome, but also head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma, gynecological squamous
cell carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and liver, brain,
skin and renal tumors [17-19]. FA subtypes FA-D1 and FA-
N are associated with increased predisposition to medul-
loblastoma, Wilms' tumor and acute leukemia in early
childhood, and are clinically different from the other FA

subtypes [20-24]. Common developmental defects
observed in FA are short stature, developmental disability
and abnormalities of the skin, upper extremities, head,
eyes, kidneys and ears [3]. In addition, male FA patients
often present abnormal gonads [3].
FA cells are hypersensitive to treatment with DNA
crosslinking agents such as cisplatin, mitomycin C
(MMC), melphalan and diepoxybutane [25], leading to
increased chromosome breakage [25,26].
The Fanconi anemia pathway
Proteins involved in the Fanconi anemia pathway
FA can be divided into at least thirteen complementation
groups (FA-A, -B, -C, -D1, -D2, -E, -F, -G, -I, -J, -L, -M and
-N), of which the responsible genes for all groups except
FA-I have been identified (summarized in Table 1)
[6,23,24,27-30]. All FA proteins are required for cellular
resistance to DNA crosslinking agents [6] and are consid-
ered to cooperate in a common pathway (the FA pathway)
that regulates the sensing, signaling and/or repair of inter-
strand DNA crosslinks (Figure 1). FA proteins are closely
related to the breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility genes
products BRCA1 and BRCA2, and to their partner pro-
teins, as described below. FANCD1 (mutated in FA-D1) is
identical to BRCA2[31] and the most recently identified
FA gene, FANCN, is in fact PALB2 (partner and localizer of
BRCA2) [23,24], a crucial regulator of the BRCA2 protein
[32]. Additionally, FANCJ is identical to BACH1/
BRIP1[29,30,33], a DNA helicase that interacts directly
with BRCA1. Furthermore, FANCD2, FANCD1/BRCA2,
FANCN/PALB2 and BRCA1 colocalize in nuclear foci at
the site of DNA damage [32][34,35] and BRCA1 itself is
required for efficient nuclear foci formation of FANCD2
[34,36]. In light of these interplays between FA and BRCA
proteins, the FA pathway is also called the “FA-BRCA path-
way” [5] or “FA-BRCA network” [11].
The FA core complex and monoubiquitylation of FANCD2
Ubiquitin plays a crucial role in the regulation of the FA
pathway. Eight FA proteins (FANCA, FANCB, FANCC,
FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL and FANCM), a newly
identified FANCM-interacting protein called FAAP24
(FANCA-associated polypeptide) [137] and an unidenti-
fied factor called FAAP100 form a nuclear protein com-
plex (the FA core complex) required for
monoubiquitylation of FANCD2 on lysine 561
[27,34,37,38]. One of the components of the FA core
complex, FANCL, has a PHD (plant homeodomain) fin-
ger/RING finger domain exhibiting auto-ubiquitin ligase
activity in vitro[38][39-41]. FANCL associates through its
PHD/RING finger domain with UBE2T, a ubiquitin con-
jugating enzyme (E2), which is also required for in vivo
FANCD2 monoubiquitylation [42]. Taken together, the
FA core complex is assumed to constitute a multi-subunit
E3 ubiquitin ligase complex for FANCD2, in which
FANCL is the catalytic E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit. The cat-
alytic activity of this complex appears to be regulated
through the inhibitory auto-monoubiquitylation of
UBE2T, stimulated in the presence of FANCL [42]. How-
ever, as the direct monoubiquitylation of FANCD2 by the
FA core complex has not been reconstituted so far in vitro,
the existence of other E2 and E3 enzymes responsible for
FANCD2 monoubiquitylation (and somehow controlled
by the FA core complex, the E2 activity of UBE2T and the
E3 activity of FANCL) cannot be ruled out formally.
Even though a direct DNA binding activity has been dem-
onstrated for unmodified FANCD2 in vitro[43], monou-
biquitylation of the protein is required for its
translocation to chromatin in vivo and nuclear foci forma-
tion at the site of DNA damage, as well as for cellular
resistance to DNA crosslinking agents [34,44]. FANCD2
monoubiquitylation and nuclear foci formation occur in
response to DNA damaging agents (ionizing radiation,
UV light irradiation, DNA crosslinking agents, hydroxyu-
rea, etc.) and during S phase of the cell cycle even in the
absence of exogenous DNA damage [34,45]. A DNA dam-
age-activated signaling kinase, ATR, and a single-strand
DNA binding protein complex, RPA, are required for DNA
damage-inducible monoubiquitylation and foci forma-
tion of FANCD2, indicating an upstream role for these fac-
tors in the activation of the FA pathway [46]. The exact
signal and activation cascade required for FANCD2
monoubiquitylation, however, remain elusive. The exist-
ence of a specific FANCD2 receptor responsible for
recruitment of the monoubiquitylated protein to chroma-
tin has also been proposed [44], but not demonstrated to
date.
Roles for the FA core complex in DNA enzymatic processing
The FA core complex is not simply the ubiquitin ligase
complex for FANCD2. In addition to its requirement for
FANCD2 monoubiquitylation, the FA core complex is
required for the translocation into chromatin of monou-
biquitylated FANCD2, and for cellular resistance to inter-
strand DNA crosslinks even if FANCD2 is localized in
chromatin, as elegantly demonstrated in chicken DT40
cells using FANCD2–monoubiquitin and FANCD2–his-
tone H2B chimeric proteins [47]. In addition, one compo-
nent of the FA core complex, FANCM, harbors DNA
helicase motifs, a degenerate nuclease motif and in vitro
DNA-stimulated ATPase and translocase activities [27].
The newly identified FAAP24 protein, in complex with
FANCM, has been shown to preferentially bind to ssDNA
and branched DNA structures [137]. Speculatively,
FANCM DNA translocase activity could play an important
role in displacing the FA core complex along the DNA,
allowing DNA damage recognition, or FAAP24 specificity
for ssDNA structures may target FANCM and the FA core

complex to abnormal, branched DNA structures. In sum-
mary, the FA core complex itself can interact with DNA
and displays some important functions outside of
FANCD2 monoubiquitylation.
Furthermore, the FA core complex forms a larger complex
with BLM, RPA and topoisomerase IIIα called BRAFT (for
BLM, RPA, FA, and topoisomerase IIIα). Although the
functional relevance of BRAFT is not clear, it harbors a
DNA unwinding activity potentially relevant for DNA
repair [37].
Negative regulation of the Fanconi anemia pathway by FANCD2
deubiquitylation
FANCD2 monoubiquitylation is a regulated and reversi-
ble process. USP1, a deubiquitylating enzyme, removes
ubiquitin from monoubiquitylated FANCD2, therefore
negatively regulating the FA pathway [48]. Interestingly,
USP1 also deubiquitylates monoubiquitylated PCNA
(proliferating cell nuclear antigen), a DNA polymerase
processivity factor [49]. PCNA monoubiquitylation leads
to the switch from a replicative polymerase to a transle-
sion synthesis (TLS) polymerase at the site of stalled rep-
lication forks [50] and participates in the bypass of DNA
lesion. Monoubiquitylation of PCNA is dependent on
RAD6 (an E2) and RAD18 (an E3) [51], but is independ-
ent of the FA core complex. Therefore, these two pathways
(the FA pathway and TLS activation through PCNA
monoubiquitylation) have different activation mecha-
nisms, but share a common shutoff mechanism.
The Fanconi anemia pathway and DNA repair
Interestingly, some TLS polymerases are also implicated in
cellular resistance to interstrand DNA crosslinks [52]. For
example, mutations in TLS polymerase-encoding REV3 or
REV1 have been shown to be epistatic with FANCC muta-
tions for crosslinker hypersensitivity in chicken DT40 cells
[53]. Furthermore, REV1 and FANCD2 colocalize in
nuclear foci [53], which could suggest a possible interac-
tion between them. The possible interplay of FA proteins

Current model of the Fanconi anemia pathwayFigure 1
Current model of the Fanconi anemia pathway. (Adapted with modifications from “The molecular pathogenesis of Fan-
coni anemia: recent progress” Taniguchi T and D'Andrea AD. Blood, Jun 2006; 107: 4223 – 4233. [6]) Eight FA proteins
(FANC-A, -B, -C, -E, -F, -G, -L and -M), a FANCM-interacting protein called FAAP24 and an unidentified factor (FAAP100)
form a nuclear complex (the FA core complex) with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. FANCL is the catalytic subunit of the complex
and directly interacts with the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBE2T through its PHD/RING domain. UBE2T can be inacti-
vated by auto-monoubiquitylation on lysine 91 (K91), but is suggested to form a thioester intermediate with ubiquitin through
it's catalytic cysteine 86 (C86) when taking part in the ubiquitylation of FANCD2 (see below). The FA core complex, BLM, RPA
and topoisomerase IIIα form a larger super-complex called BRAFT. Note that for diagrammatic purposes the FA core complex
is shown here interacting with the FAAP100 subunit, but in reality the quaternary structure of the BRAFT complex is
unknown. In response to exogenous DNA damage, or during normal S phase progression, the FANCD2 protein is monoubiq-
uitylated on lysine 561 (K561) in an FA core complex- and UBE2T-dependent manner. DNA damage-induced monoubiquityla-
tion of FANCD2 also requires ATR and RPA. Monoubiquitylation of FANCD2 targets the protein into nuclear foci where it
co-localizes with BRCA1, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCN/PALB2, RAD51, FANCJ/BRIP1 and other proteins. At least some com-
ponents of the FA core complex (FANCC, FANCE and FANCG) also form nuclear foci. All of these factors are required for
cellular resistance to DNA crosslinking agents. Monoubiquitylation of PCNA on lysine 164 (K164) requires RAD6 as an E2 and
RAD18 as an E3, but not the FA core complex. In turn, modification of PCNA causes recruitment of translesion synthesis
(TLS) DNA polymerases at the site of stalled replication forks. USP1 deubiquitylates both PCNA and FANCD2, negatively reg-
ulating both the Fanconi anemia pathway and monoubiquitylation of PCNA.

and TLS polymerases in a common pathway regulating
the bypass of DNA damage, however, remains to be clari-
fied.
One of the most important issues to clarify concerning the
role of the FA pathway in DNA repair is how FA proteins
(the FA core complex, FANCD2, FANCD1/BRCA2,
FANCN/PALB2, FANCJ/BRIP1/BACH1) and other factors
(RAD51, BRCA1, BLM, TLS polymerases etc.) cooperate to
sense, signal and repair DNA crosslinks.
In nuclear foci, FANCD2 colocalizes with factors known
to be involved in DNA repair and/or DNA damage
response, such as BRCA1, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCN /
PALB2, RAD51, BLM, RPA and ATR [32,34-36,45,46].
FANCD2 also partially colocalizes with FANCJ/BRIP1/
BACH1 [33] and NBS1, part of the MRE11–RAD50–NBS1
complex implicated in the recognition and early signaliza-
tion of damaged DNA [54]. Among the subunits of the FA
core complex, at least FANCC and FANCE are reported to
colocalize with FANCD2 in nuclear foci [47,55], and
FANCG with BRCA2 and RAD51 [56]. All these factors are
required for cellular resistance to interstrand DNA
crosslinking agents.
Among FA proteins, FANCD1/BRCA2 and FANCJ/BRIP1/
BACH1 are neither part of the FA core complex nor
required for FANCD2 monoubiquitylation or foci forma-
tion [28,31]. They may work downstream of FANCD2
monoubiquitylation and/or in another pathway. Interest-
ingly, these proteins have been strongly linked to DNA
double-strand breaks repair by homologous recombina-
tion (HR) [33,57]. Specifically, FANCD1/BRCA2 regulates
HR by controlling the activity of RAD51, the eukaryotic
homolog of bacterial RecA [57,58]. FANCD1/BRCA2 sta-
bility and localization in nuclear structures (chromatin
and nuclear matrix) is in turn regulated by FANCN/PALB2
[32]. Whether FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCN/PALB2 and
RAD51 act downstream or independently of monoubiq-
uitylated FANCD2 and other FA proteins remains unclear.
Evidence in favor of a regulatory role for the FA pathway
on FANCD1/BRCA2 and RAD51 function comes from
reports that monoubiquitylated FANCD2 is required for
both the loading of FANCD1/BRCA2 onto damaged chro-
matin and the increase in FANCD1/BRCA2 and RAD51
nuclear foci in response to DNA damage [35]. However,
the requirement for the FA core complex and FANCD2 in
efficient RAD51 foci formation in response to DNA dam-
age [35,59,60], as well as the efficiency of HR in FA cells
(reviewed in reference [6]), remain controversial.
FANCD1/BRCA2- and FANCN/PALB2-deficient cells have
a clear defect in RAD51 foci formation and HR efficiency
[23,32,57,61-63]. In other FA cells, at least mild defects in
HR have been documented [33,53,62,64-67], although
other reports show normal HR efficiency in these cells
[68-70].
FANCJ/BRIP1/BACH1 has DNA-dependent ATPase activ-
ity and 5′–3′ DNA helicase activity, and directly binds to
the phospho-protein binding BRCT (BRCA1 carboxyl-ter-
minal domain [72,73]) of BRCA1 [71]. How FANCJ/
BRIP1/BACH1 interacts with other FA proteins has not
been reported, except for partial colocalization with
FANCD2 in nuclear foci [33]. Though RAD51 foci forma-
tion is normal in FA-J cells (deficient in FANCJ/BRIP1/
BACH1) [63], HR efficiency appears to be affected [33].
Taken together, these evidences suggest that FANCD2
plays a role in regulating DNA repair (especially of inter-
strand DNA crosslinks) in chromatin in cooperation with
BRCA1, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCJ/BRIP1/BACH1, the FA
core complex and other factors, but the precise mecha-
nism by which this occurs remains unknown. The highly
regulated process of FANCD2 monoubiquitylation could
play a crucial role in orienting the repair of DNA damage
to HR and/or in attracting TLS polymerases to sites of
DNA damage.
Other roles for the Fanconi anemia proteins outside of DNA repair
Several FA proteins function outside of DNA crosslink
repair. For example, the phosphorylation of FANCD2 at
serine 222 by ATM kinase in response to ionizing radia-
tion is required for the establishment of IR-induced intra-
S phase checkpoint, but is not required for resistance to
DNA crosslinking agents [74]. Additionally, FANCC
(localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus) is impli-
cated in several cytoplasmic functions, such as JAK/STAT
and apoptotic signaling [75-80].
Alterations in the Fanconi anemia pathway in human
cancer in the general (non-FA) population
FA patients have an increased risk of developing leukemia
and solid tumors, but alterations in the FA pathway have
also been reported in a wide variety of human cancers in
the general (non-FA) population [81-94] (reviewed in ref-
erences [6,10]). Abnormalities in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in
cancer have been reviewed elsewhere [95]. Methylation of
FANCF, leading to its decreased expression, has been
reported in ovarian cancer [81,82], breast cancer [84],
non-small cell lung cancer [85], cervical cancer [86], tes-
ticular cancer [87], head and neck squamous cell carci-
noma [85], and granulosa cell tumors of the ovary [83].
Inherited and somatic mutations of FANCC and FANCG
have been detected in a subset of young onset pancreatic
cancer [89,96]. Additionally, inherited mono-allelic
mutations in BACH1/BRIP1/FANCJ and FANCN/PALB2
have been recently implicated in breast cancer predisposi-
tion (familial breast cancer) [97][23,24], suggesting that
these genes may be the low penetrance breast/ovarian

cancer susceptibility genes researchers have been looking
for to explain the non-BRCA1/non-BRCA2 cases. Because
the integrity of the FA pathway is crucial for cellular resist-
ance to interstrand DNA crosslinking agents (cisplatin,
MMC, melphalan, etc.), tumors with defects in the path-
way may be hypersensitive to these agents. In fact, in some
cancer cell lines (human ovarian cancer cell lines (TOV-
21G and 2008) [81], human myeloma cell lines (8226
and U266) [98] and a human pancreatic cancer cell line
(PL11) [99]), the integrity of the FA pathway is a determi-
nant of cisplatin (or melphalan) resistance in vitro or in
vivo (mouse xenograft model) [81,98-100].
Disease models, knockouts, assays
Generation of various knockout murine models for FA
(Fanca[101,102], Fancc[103,104], Fancg[105,106],
Fancd2[107], Fanca-Fancc double [108], Fancl/Pog[109]
and Fancd1/Brca2 [110] ) have been reported. These FA
mice display similar phenotypes to that of human FA
patients, for example chromosome instability, defective
germ cell development and sensitivity to DNA crosslink-
ing agents. Although FA mice do not spontaneously
develop bone marrow failure (except for mouse models of
the FA-D1 group, harboring homozygous hypomorphic
mutations in Fancd1/Brca2[110]), treatment with MMC
causes bone marrow failure in Fancc knockout mice [111].
The reason for the absence of spontaneous bone marrow
failure in FA mice is still unknown. Several FA mice
(Fancd2[107], Fanca[102] and Fancc [112]) are reported
to develop tumors including adenocarcinoma, lym-
phoma, sarcoma and ovarian granulosa cell tumor. In
addition, many Brca1- and Brca2-deficient mouse models
with cancer susceptibility have been generated (reviewed
in reference [113]). FA mice are useful tools to test the
applicability of new FA treatment modalities, such as gene
therapy [114-120], ex vivo manipulation of hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells [121] and cytokine treatment [122].
Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, Xenopus and zebrafish
homologs of FA genes have been more recently identified
(Table 1). The FA gene network is conserved from
zebrafish [123] and Xenopus[124] to human, while only
FANCD2, FANCL and FANCM have Drosophila homologs
[125], and FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCD2 (FCD-2), FANCJ
and FANCM have homologs in C. elegans[126] (Table 1).
Drosophila and C. elegans models will therefore be useful
for testing the functions of key proteins in the FA pathway.
As only FANCD2, FANCL and FANCM are present in Dro-
sophila, these proteins may constitute the minimal FA
pathway machinery. In turn, C. elegans may enable a bet-
ter understanding of the roles of FANCD1/BRCA2 and
FANCJ in the context of the minimal machinery consti-
tuted by FANCD2 and FANCM. As with vertebrate
mutants, Drosophila fancd2 and fancl mutants, as well as C.
elegans fancd2 mutants, show hypersensitivity to DNA
crosslinking agents [125,126]. Drosophila and C. elegans
models may, therefore, be useful to dissect the roles and
regulations of the FA pathway in a less complex network.
The zebrafish model may prove a valuable tool with
which to investigate the impact of FA pathway failure on
development as fancd2-deficient zebrafish embryos
develop similar defects to those found in children with
FA, including shortened body length, microcephaly
(small head) and microphthalmia (small eyes) [127]. The
Xenopus model mostly constitutes a powerful tool with
which to investigate the regulation of the FA pathway in
vitro through cell-free assay systems using replicating egg
extracts [124]. Such assays could also be utilized for
screening drugs that modulate the FA pathway.
Disease targets and ligands
The FA pathway is required for cellular resistance to DNA
crosslinking agents, including widely used anti-cancer
drugs such as cisplatin, MMC and melphalan. As such,
inhibition of the FA pathway will lead to sensitization of
tumor cells to these drugs. Therefore, the FA pathway is an
attractive target for developing small molecule inhibitors
that may be clinically useful as chemosensitizers in the
treatment of cancer. As described above, the FA pathway
involves formation of a multi-subunit protein complex
harboring E3 ligase activity, several enzymes (ubiquitin
ligase and conjugating enzyme, deubiquitinating enzyme,
kinase, ATPase/DNA translocase and ATPase/helicase)
and many protein–protein or protein–DNA interactions.
All of these components are potential targets for small
molecule inhibitors of the FA pathway.
Drug development targeting the FA pathway is still in the
early stages, and therefore not much information is avail-
able. A high-throughput cell-based screening assay for
small molecule inhibitors of the FA pathway has, how-
ever, been developed by Alan D'Andrea (Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute), Toshiyasu Taniguchi (Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center) and their colleagues [128]. In
this screen, inhibition of DNA damage-induced FANCD2
nuclear foci formation was utilized as a readout. Contin-
ued screening is ongoing and a partial result focusing on
one inhibitor, curcumin (diferuloylmethane), has been
published [128]. Curcumin is a low-molecular-weight
polyphenol derived from the rhizome Curcuma longa and
is the principal ingredient in the spice turmeric [129].
Curcumin inhibits FANCD2 monoubiquitylation and
nuclear foci formation, although its exact target in the FA
pathway has not been identified [128]. However, curcu-
min sensitizes an ovarian cancer cell line to cisplatin in an
FA pathway-dependent manner, suggesting that curcumin
sensitization of cisplatin mostly occurs through FA path-
way inhibition [128]. In order to establish curcumin as a
useful cisplatin chemosensitizer, a detailed isobologram
analysis of combinations of curcumin with cisplatin, in

vivo studies using mouse models, and identification of the
target of curcumin in the FA pathway are required.
New frontiers in drug discovery
Elucidating the mechanism of action of the candidate
inhibitors identified in the above-mentioned screen [128]
will be crucial for development of specific and effective
inhibitors of the FA pathway, and for further understand-
ing the regulation of the FA pathway. Precise analyses of
the effects of each drug on individual steps in the FA path-
way will be required to identify their specific targets. These
analyses will include in vitro ATR kinase assay, in vitro
UBE2T and FANCL autoubiquitylation assays, assessment
of FA core complex formation and evaluation of nuclear
foci formation of DNA repair proteins including BRCA1.
A better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms, as
well as the identification of new partners of the FA path-
way, is also crucial for the identification and development
of FA pathway inhibitors. Although multiple groups have
been working on structural analysis of FA proteins
[130,131], so far few FA protein crystal structures
(BRCA2/FANCD1 [130] and FANCF [131]) have been
reported, but such studies could provide useful informa-
tion for drug design as well as for elucidation of the targets
of the candidate inhibitors.
