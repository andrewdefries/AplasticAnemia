Abstract
Background: The population of survivors following allogeneic HSCT continues to increase, and yet their
experiences of recovery and long-term survivorship have not been fully characterized. This paper presents a study
protocol examining over time the functional status, psychosocial adjustment, health-related quality of life, and
symptom experience of survivors who have undergone allogeneic transplantation. The aims of the study are to: 1)
explore the patterns of change in these health outcomes during the survivorship phase; 2) characterize subgroups
of survivors experiencing adverse outcomes; and 3) examine relationships among outcomes and demographic and
clinical factors (such as age, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and disease relapse).
Methods: In this longitudinal observational study, adults who survive a minimum of 3 years from date of
allogeneic transplantation complete a series of questionnaires annually. Demographic and clinical data are
collected along with a series of patient-reported outcome measures, specifically: 1) Medical Outcomes Study SF- 36;
2) Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) - General, 3) FACIT-Fatigue; 4) FACIT- Spiritual; 5)
Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale; 6) Rotterdam Symptom Checklist-Revised; and 7) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index.
Conclusions: This study will provide multidimensional patient-reported outcomes data to expand the
understanding of the survivorship experience across the trajectory of allogeneic transplantation recovery. There are
a number of inherent challenges in recruiting and retaining a diverse and representative sample of long-term
transplant survivors. Study results will contribute to an understanding of outcomes experienced by transplant
survivors, including those with chronic GVHD, malignant disease relapse, and other late effects following allogeneic
transplantation.

Introduction
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(HSCT) is an established and potentially curative treat-
ment for various hematologic diseases [1-3]. More than
50 years after the first reports of bone marrow grafting,
the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) reports
approximately 20,000 allogeneic transplants in the U.S.
annually [4]. Allogeneic HSCT has become standard
therapy for patients with a wide variety of indications
[5]; coupled with the increased availability of unrelated
donors, and the use of cord blood as a stem cell source
[6], the number of transplant recipients continues to
grow.
The toxicity profile associated with an allogeneic
HSCT is prominent. Significant toxicities result from
the intense chemotherapy and radiotherapy utilized to

prepare recipients, and from acute and chronic graft-
versus-host disease (GVHD) that results from donor
anti-host immune response against normal host tissues.
Despite the toxicities, most 2-year survivors are cured of
their original disease, yet their mortality rate remains
higher than that of an age-matched healthy population
[7]. The 3-year mortality following allogeneic HSCT
ranges from 30-60%, depending upon factors such as
age, co-morbid illness, malignant disease status at the
time of transplantation, intensity of the preparative regi-
men, source of stem cell graft, and the extent of histo-
incompatibility between donor and recipient [8,9].
Although there are an estimated 150,000 individuals
living in the US who have survived 5 years or more fol-
lowing allogeneic HSCT [6], the patterns of recovery
relative to functional status, psychosocial adjustment,
quality of life and symptom distress in survivors 3 or
more years following transplant are not fully under-
stood. There have been several recent systematic reviews
[10,11], but our knowledge of the recovery process is
incomplete. For example, survivors of autologous HSCT
are included in many of the study samples [11]; how-
ever, these observations may not generalize to survivors
of allogeneic HSCT. Whereas the early recovery period
following autologous and allogeneic HSCT may be
somewhat comparable, allogeneic HSCT survivors
encounter unique complications, such as acute and
chronic GVHD and opportunistic infections related to
the need for prolonged courses of immunosuppression.
These conditions can be anticipated to substantially
shape the symptom experience, functional status, psy-
chosocial health, and health-related quality of life
(HRQL) experienced by long-term survivors of allo-
geneic HSCT. Previously studied samples have also
tended to represent a limited range of cultural and eth-
nic diversity, and there has also been a trend for HSCT
survivor studies to utilize cross-sectional rather than
longitudinal designs.
The experience of subpopulations of transplant survi-
vors, such as those receiving reduced intensity condi-
tioning (RIC) regimens, has not been fully characterized.
The availability of RIC regimens has extended the elig-
ibility for allogeneic HSCT to patients with solid tumors,
those who are older than 55 years of age, and/or those
with significant co-morbidities. Importantly, long-term
quality of life outcomes in survivors of such RIC regi-
mens have had only limited evaluation [12,13].
Improved knowledge of the pattern and correlates of
recovery and long-term survivorship can be applied to
inform screening/surveillance in transplant survivors,
and would guide the development and testing of sup-
portive care strategies to improve clinical outcomes in
this patient population. This paper presents the rationale
for and design of a longitudinal study to examine
functional status, adjustment, quality of life, and symp-
toms in a diverse sample of English and Spanish speak-
ing adult patients who have survived 3 years or more
following an allogeneic HSCT, some of whom are
experiencing late effects of transplantation, including
chronic GVHD and disease relapse.
Background
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) defines cancer
survivors as individuals “who have been diagnosed with
cancer and the people in their lives who are affected by
the diagnosis, including family members, friends, and
caregivers” [14]. The evidence base examining outcomes
in cancer survivors continues to grow; however, allo-
geneic HSCT survivors are under-represented in these
studies and have some unique needs due to the intensity
of the treatment, requirement for prolonged immuno-
suppression, and their risk for a range of late health
effects. Individuals who receive allogeneic HSCT require
close surveillance for a wide range of complications and
health effects that may be anticipated to occur during
the early (HSCT day to day 100), mid- (day 100 to 1
year), and long-term (beyond 1 year) phases of recovery
[15,16]. Despite reports of negative physical and psycho-
social sequelae and poor health-related quality of life
(HRQL) early after HSCT [17,18], several studies suggest
that by the fifth year of recovery, the majority of long-
term allogeneic HSCT survivors report good to excellent
HRQL relative to healthy populations and relative to
patients with other chronic diseases [19-22]. However,
there is variability in the pattern of recovery, and some
survivors experience persistent and late effects of the
conditioning regimen and transplantation procedure.
Research exploring the functional status of patients
who have undergone an HSCT suggests considerable
variability in the pace and extent of functional recovery.
Although most patients experience some level of func-
tional impairment in the period immediately following
the transplant, the majority report gradual improvement
over time with functional status comparable, in 1 or
more dimensions, to age-matched healthy individuals
[23-27]. Some studies have documented that 5-year sur-
vivors return to a level of physical function comparable
to their pre-transplant baseline [28] or to a level of phy-
sical function on par with that observed in survivors
who received conventional dose chemotherapy only
[29]. On the other hand, investigators have described
functional impairments in 10-year survivors relative to
population norms [25,29,30]. Residual difficulties
reported by survivors include impairments in physical
and cognitive function [24,31-33], as well as restricted
role and occupational functioning [24,27,33,34].
Few studies have explored functional status longitud-
inally following allogeneic HSCT. For example, a small

sample of 16 participants reported little change in func-
tional status beyond a mean of 28 months post trans-
plant, thereby suggesting that a recovery plateau in
terms of functional status may be achieved at approxi-
mately 2 years post-HSCT [33]. Similarly, most
improvements in physical functioning occurred between
90 days and 2 years post transplant, with complete
recovery for about 75% of patients by 2 years; nonethe-
less, an additional 10-20% of patients made some
improvement in functioning between 2 and 4 years
post-transplant [35]. In contrast, particularly in patients
older than 25 at the time of HSCT, recovery may be
non-linear, with functional status continuing to improve
significantly with time, suggesting that relative to
younger survivors, the trajectory of recovery in older
patients may be somewhat delayed [17].
A major factor associated with impairments in func-
tional status following HSCT is chronic GVHD. The
incidence of chronic GVHD is estimated to range from
30% to 70% based in part on the degree of HLA mis-
match between the HSCT donor and recipient [36]. Sur-
vivors experiencing chronic GVHD report impairments
related to physical functioning, incomplete resumption
of social function, and sexual dysfunction [17,37-41].
Chronic GVHD has also been associated with greater
psychological and social dysfunction [25,28].
Psychological and social recovery lags behind physical
recovery in allogeneic HSCT survivors [28]. When com-
pared to controls or chemotherapy-only survivors [29],
allogeneic HSCT survivors report impairments in social
and emotional functioning at 5 [30] and 10 [29] years
following transplantation. Research suggests that the
experience of long-term survivorship after allogeneic
HSCT, associated symptoms, and late effects can cause
negative changes in self-concept [42] and mood distur-
bance [32,43] including depression [32,35,44], anxiety
[35,45], and psychosocial distress [32,46]. The impact on
social recovery includes diminished social relationships
and social function [32,47,48]. The rate of return to
work is quite variable, with reports ranging from 50-
84% [23,25,28]. In the family unit, concern over family
well-being has been documented as a source of stress
for HSCT recipients [43], and there is evidence that
transplant survivors and their partners experience poor
dyadic adjustment [32]. Difficulties relative to sexual
function (desire, arousal, and orgasm) are often reported
as an issue by HSCT survivors [23,24,45,49-52], with
survivors of HSCT reporting higher psychosexual dys-
function compared with healthy subjects [34].
There is little systematic information to characterize
the symptom experience of allogeneic HSCT survivors.
Survivors who were 5-10 years post-transplant reported
more symptoms than healthy controls [30] and survivors
from chemotherapy alone [29]. Studies suggest that
discomforting physical symptoms such as fatigue
[25,27,53-55], dyspnea [24], problems with sleep quality
[27,45,56], taste changes [45], oral dryness [47], eye pro-
blems [25,45], skin dryness [27], joint stiffness [25,27],
memory problems [25], cough [45], vaginal dryness and
dyspareunia [17], which may or may not be directly
attributable to chronic GVHD, are prevalent in trans-
plant survivors across the survivorship continuum.
Little is known about how these symptoms evolve
across time or the consequences of symptom burden for
functional status and psychosocial health [25,27].
Research suggests that some improvements occur in the
prevalence and severity of distressing symptoms across
the first 5 years of recovery following allogeneic HSCT
[43]. However, studies suggest that symptoms such as
moderate-to-severe fatigue, skin dryness, pain, joint stiff-
ness, eye symptoms, dyspnea, and problems with sleep
remain prominent difficulties [23,25,27,29,30,38,
45,52,56]. In correlational analyses, greater physical
symptom distress was associated with higher levels of
psychological distress and maladjustment [22,43,57,58],
and inferior HRQL [34]. In a mixed sample of autolo-
gous and allogeneic HSCT survivors in which non-fati-
gued and severely fatigued survivors were compared,
HSCT survivors with severe fatigue reported signifi-
cantly more sleep disturbance on single-item measures
of sleep quality or insomnia [55].
Despite the persistence of discomforting symptoms,
problems with functional status and psychosocial well-
being, survivors report that they would make the same
choice again to undergo HSCT [20,27,59]. Indeed, there
is evidence that with long-term survivorship may come
salutary effects including spiritual growth, greater appre-
ciation for life, and enhanced interpersonal relationships
[60]. In support of this conclusion, it has been observed
that survivors who were 3 or more years post-transplant
reported higher scores in the domains of social func-
tioning, mental health, and vitality when compared to
normative scores. In addition, psychological, interperso-
nal, and spiritual growth has been reported when com-
pared to an age- and gender-matched healthy
comparison group [32]. Studies in allogeneic HSCT sur-
vivors also suggest that meaning in life, defined as the
general sense that one’s life has purpose and coherence,
is positively related to several indicators of psychological
adjustment [61] and improved functioning [45].
The recovery process following allogeneic HSCT
appears to be nonlinear and unique for each individual.
For example, qualitative data indicates that there may be
transitions in the sense of meaning and coherence
across the survivorship journey [62]. A period of griev-
ing and life re-evaluation may be experienced during the
third year post-HSCT, whereas through the fifth year
post-HSCT and beyond, those survivors with residual

physical problems report despair and concern about
their futures [63]. Similarly a temporary decline in
HRQL may occur at 10 years post-transplant, followed
by a return to previously enjoyed levels. These observa-
tions suggest that the 10-year post-transplant anniver-
sary may induce a transient increase in anxiety that
reverses once the milestone is passed [23].
This study was designed to overcome many of the
aforementioned limitations of the current literature and
to address an important gap in understanding by offer-
ing a prospective, longitudinal, multidimensional exami-
nation of functional status, psychosocial adjustment,
HRQL, and symptoms in a cohort of survivors 3 or
more years following allogeneic HSCT. Such knowledge
can be applied to strengthen clinician decision-making,
and to allow patients and families to anticipate the pro-
cess of recovery and optimize their self-management.
This research will also provide valuable information
needed for the development and testing of interventions
for patients at high risk for poor health outcomes during
the survivorship phase.
Methods/Design
Study Design
This is an ongoing prospective, longitudinal, observa-
tional study, in which adult patients who have survived
a minimum of 3 years from date of allogeneic HSCT
complete an annual survey using a variety of patient-
reported outcome measures. Survivors are approached
for participation within 60 days of their annual trans-
plant follow-up, with subsequent yearly surveys linked
to the date of their enrollment.
Study Aims
A revised version of the Wilson and Cleary [64] model
of health-related quality of life is applied to describe the
relationships among conceptually distinct dimensions
and make explicit the health concepts that are related to
HRQL. The major health concepts evaluated in this
study are obtained by patient self-report and include:
physical and mental functioning, HRQL, psychosocial
adjustment, and spiritual well-being. Aspects of the
symptom experience evaluated in this study include
physical and psychological symptom distress, fatigue,
and sleep quality. The primary aim of the study is to
explore the patterns of change in the major health out-
comes during the survivorship phase. We hypothesize
that functional status, psychosocial adjustment, cancer
specific quality of life, or symptoms will vary over 3
sequential annual time points as a function of 1 or more
clinical covariates in patients 3 or more years following
allogeneic HSCT. Secondary aims of the study include
1) to characterize groups of survivors at risk for impair-
ment; and 2) to explore relationships between a wide
array of demographic, clinical factors, and health out-
comes determined to be critical during survivorship
phase.
Sample Recruitment
Approval to conduct the study was obtained through the
National Heart Lung and Blood Institute’s intramural
institutional review board. Participants are eligible to
participate if they are: 1) ≥3 years post-first allogeneic
HSCT; 2) ≥18 years of age; 3) able to read and speak
English or Spanish; and 4) have a life expectancy of at
least 6 months. Each potential subject is approached,
and, if willing to participate, provides written informed
consent.
The goal is to recruit survivors during their face-to-
face outpatient follow-up with the transplant team.
Although the majority of subjects return at annual inter-
vals for in-person clinical follow-up, this number
decreases as the time from allogeneic HSCT increases.
When a subject does not return for an in-person clinical
follow-up, contact is made to confirm the mailing
address and evaluate their clinical status. Study materials
are subsequently mailed with instructions and pre-paid
materials for survey return.
Study Procedures
Recruiting a diverse sample relative to race/ethnicity and
language has implications for the selection of the survey
instruments and for resource management including the
budget and workload management among study team
members. At the time of study initiation, we determined
that enrolling Spanish-speaking subjects who were pre-
dominantly from Latin America and relatively unaccul-
turated, was not only feasible but would make a
substantive contribution to our understanding of the
post-transplant survivorship experience. The contextual
model of HRQL informed the selection of variables that
describe the cultural and socio-ecological characteristics
of our sample, and guided the development of hypoth-
eses about the effects of these characteristics on func-
tional status, the symptom experience, and HRQL in
transplant survivors [65]. The contextual model of
HRQL model extends the predominantly individual-cen-
tered HRQL paradigm to include contextual factors
such as acculturation, social support, living arrange-
ments, and country of residence which may be central
to quality of life outcomes among ethnically and socio-
economically diverse populations.
All measures selected for this study are available in
both English and Spanish, although this is not true of all
possible measures considered for the study. Beyond the
selection of a measure, investigators may also incur
additional licensing fees for measures in each language
beyond English. Additional budget considerations
Bevans et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes 2011, 9:24
http://www.hqlo.com/content/9/1/24
Page 4 of 9
include mailing fees for subjects who do not return at
least annually for clinical follow-ups, and/or who reside
outside of the United States. Multiple clinicians who are
fluent in Spanish serve as associate investigators on the
study, providing language concordance to facilitate the
consent process, survey administration and the collec-
tion of clinical data when appropriate.
Although the focus of the research is on aggregated
group data, individual subject surveys are reviewed in
real-time for clinically meaningful responses that might
require immediate assessment and possible interven-
tion. To address the ethical concerns in sharing these
data between the research and the clinical teams, the
informed consent process encourages subjects to com-
municate directly with their clinical provider if they
identify a concern during survey completion. In addi-
tion, the study team discusses directly with individual
subjects any concerns that are identified through sur-
vey responses, and recommends further discussion
with their clinical providers. Evidence suggests that
HSCT clinicians may not fully appreciate the declines
in well-being or psychosocial health experienced by
transplant survivors [49]; therefore, study team mem-
bers with expertise in particular areas (e.g. fatigue
management, sleep quality, psychological adjustment)
offered the primary care team referral suggestions,
when appropriate.
Measurement
Physical and Mental Health is measured using the Med-
ical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short Form 36 (SF-36). The
SF-36 is a 36-item self-report measure of physical and
mental health [66]. The 36 items evaluate 8 factors
including: physical functioning, physical role function-
ing, emotional role functioning, social functioning, bod-
ily pain, mental health, vitality, and general health. In
addition to the individual subscale scores, 2 component
summary scores, physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) are
computed through aggregation of the subscales. The SF-
36 was translated into Spanish through the International
Quality of Life Assessment Project. Strong evidence of
internal consistency reliability and construct validity has
also been documented in Spanish-speaking samples
[67-70].
Health-related quality of life (HRQL) is measured with
the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General
Version 4 (FACT-G). The FACT-G is a 27-item self-
report disease-specific quality of life (QOL) question-
naire that is divided into 4 primary domains: physical,
social/family, emotional well-being, and functional well-
being. The FACT-G provides an overall QOL score and
also a score for each subscale. The Spanish version of
the FACT-G (version 4) has demonstrated construct
validity and evidence of strong internal consistency
reliability (a = 0.89) in various groups of Spanish speak-
ing oncology patients [71-74].
Psychosocial adjustment is measured with the Psycho-
social Adjustment to Illness Scale-Self Report (PAIS-
SR). The PAIS-SR is a 46-item measure of psychosocial
adjustment to illness in terms of 7 primary domains of
adjustment: health care orientation, vocational environ-
ment, domestic environment, sexual relationships,
extended family relationships, social environment, and
psychological distress [75,76]. The PAIS-SR provides a
PAIS Total Adjustment Score in addition to a score for
each subscale. The PAIS-SR is also available in Spanish
with evidence of internal consistency reliability (a =
0.72) in a mixed sample of Hispanic and non-Hispanic
women with cancer [77].
Physical and psychological symptoms are assessed with
the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL). The RSCL is
a 39-item self-report questionnaire measuring the qual-
ity of life in terms of 4 domains: physical symptoms dis-
tress, psychological distress, activity level, and overall
global life quality in various types of cancer patients
undergoing various treatments [78,79]. For this study,
only the physical symptom distress and psychological
distress are assessed. The physical symptoms distress
scale consists of 23 items referring to different physical
symptoms that are general (e.g. headaches) or cancer
specific (e.g. gastrointestinal distress). The psychological
distress scale consists of 7 items that reflect psychologi-
cal symptoms that may be experienced by cancer
patients. A Spanish version of the Rotterdam Symptom
Checklist is also available and has demonstrated strong
internal consistency reliability (a = 0.76 PSDS; a = 0.80
PDS) and construct validity in Spanish-speaking cancer
patients [21].
Fatigue and Spiritual Well-Being are measured with
domain-specific subscales of the Functional Assessment
of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT). The FACIT-Fatigue
scale is a 13-item self-report measure of cancer related
fatigue [73]. The FACIT-Spiritual is a 12-item measure
of spiritual well-being in patients with a chronic illness,
including cancer [73,80]. The FACIT-Fatigue and the
FACIT-Spiritual have been translated into Spanish with
evidence of reliability in Spanish-speaking cancer
patients [73,74,80].
Sleep Quality is measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep
Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI is an 18-item self-
report measure of perceived sleep quality. The PSQI
provides a global score as well as domain scores for sub-
jective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habi-
tual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping
medications, and daytime dysfunction [81]. Although
evidence of validity and acceptable reliability have been
reported for the English version [82], the psychometric
properties for the Spanish language version of the PSQI

have not been reported, although the PSQI has been
used to evaluate sleep quality in Spanish-speaking
women with gynecological and breast cancer [83].
Self-reported demographic variables include age, gen-
der, race, ethnicity, marital status, number of children,
current living arrangement, employment status, educa-
tion level, health insurance status, primary language,
acculturation [84], country of current residence, birth,
and when diagnosed with transplant-related illness.
Clinical variables relative to the transplant procedure
and current clinical status are abstracted primarily from
the clinical research record and include primary disease,
intensity of conditioning regimen (i.e. reduced vs. mye-
loablative conditioning), date of transplant, degree of
donor-recipient HLA match, donor stem cell source,
current stage of disease, performance status, current
anti-cancer treatment, history of acute [85] and chronic
GVHD, current grade [86] and severity [87] of chronic
GVHD, and the intensity of current immunosuppressive
regimen.
Data Analysis
The primary objective is to describe the patterns of
change in functional status, psychosocial adjustment,
symptoms, and cancer-specific HRQL following allo-
geneic HSCT in patients ≥3 years from allogeneic
HSCT. Data from a recently completed study of HRQL
following allogeneic HSCT was used to determine the
detectable effect size relative to the primary research
questions with a sample of size 80 and an alpha level of
0.05 [12]. In that study, no difference in fit between a
model that assumed compound symmetry and one that
assumed an unstructured covariance matrix was found.
Thus, we assumed compound symmetry in estimating
power. Estimated correlations across various measure-
ment times (day 0 to day 30, day 30 to day 100, day 0
to day 100) were 0.25 for the FACT-G, 0.48 for the PCS
dimension of the SF-36 and 0.52 for the MCS dimen-
sion of the SF-36; however, we realize that the correla-
tions might lessen due to a reduction in error variance
across the 3 years that subjects participate. Means on
the PCS dimension of the SF-36 ranged from 35 to 40
with standard deviations ranging from 8 to 10 based on
samples of 58 to 75 subjects. MCS means ranged from
44 to 49 with standard deviations from 9 to 10.5, again
for samples of 58 to 75 subjects. Because these are
normed scores, we can assume that the means and stan-
dard deviations will be in these ranges for the 3 years of
data collection.
We examined the detectable effect size under several
options, and made assumptions that: 1) means would be
in the same range for the 3 time periods that we pro-
posed to measure; 2) correlations across time would be
no higher than we found in the earlier study and might,
in fact, be lower; and 3) standard deviations would be in
a comparable range to prior studies. The parameters to
estimate the effect size were varied so that it could be
detected under different scenarios assuming a 1-way
repeated measures design. The level of significance was
fixed at 0.05, sample size fixed at 80, and power fixed at
80%. On that basis, we are confident we will be able to
detect a small effect size for our 3 primary scales. All
calculations were completed using nQuery Advisor®
(Statistical Solutions Ltd, Boston, MA).
Descriptive statistics were used to describe the clinical
and demographic characteristics of the subjects. For all
analyses, significance was set at a=0.05 including post-
hoc analyses which will be exploratory. In addition, time
post-transplant was examined as a covariate in the ana-
lyses. If the time post transplant was found to be signifi-
cant, a separate analysis was performed with
stratification of the subjects into patient subgroups by
year post-transplant (e.g. 3-5 years and 6 or more years).
The study involves repeated measurements over time;
therefore, methods of longitudinal analysis, such as
mixed-effects models will be used to evaluate change
over time for the primary analyses. Covariates, including
biologic, physiologic, and treatment-related factors, are
anticipated to influence HRQL and will be incorporated
into the cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis as
appropriate. Prior research suggests that the condition-
ing regimen [22], age at transplantation [27], indication
for transplant (non-malignant hematological conditions,
such as aplastic anemia, versus malignant conditions)
[50], type of transplant (matched sibling versus unre-
lated donor) [49] and the number of post-transplant
complications experienced [17] all influence overall
HRQL, as well as functional status and psychosocial
health. Chronic GVHD is consistently a negative predic-
tor of HRQL outcomes [27,35,88], and more intensive
regimens of immunosuppression have been shown to
contribute to adverse changes in functional performance
in chronic GVHD [41].
Additional analysis is exploratory and hypotheses gen-
erating to examine the relationships among study vari-
ables and change across annual time points for
individual variables. Methods of correlation and regres-
sion analysis will be used to evaluate the relationships
between outcomes of interest and study variables.
Because the study involves repeated measurements,
methods of longitudinal analysis, such as the generalized
estimating equations, mixed-effects models and growth
mixture modeling will be used to evaluate change in
health outcomes over time.
Discussion
This longitudinal observational study will improve the
understanding of variations in, and predictors of, the

patient experience of allogeneic transplant survivor-
ship, in particular, new understanding related to
aspects of the patient experience that have been pre-
viously understudied, including fatigue, sleep quality,
symptom distress, and psychosocial adjustment. Sub-
jects are enrolled 3 or more years beyond the date of
HSCT–a time when the survivor is beyond the greatest
risk for disease- or treatment-related mortality and is
likely to have fully reintegrated [89] into social roles
that were relinquished during the acute treatment
phase. As more attention is given to characterizing the
effects of treatment on survivors and their families,
this study will determine the prevalence and associa-
tions between relevant factors and define subsets of
patients at highest risk for poor outcomes. These aims
will be accomplished with a longitudinal design and in
a sample comprised exclusively of survivors of allo-
geneic HSCT. The study will be further enriched by
the inclusion of subgroups that have been understu-
died in prior stem cell transplant survivorship research,
including Spanish speakers, and individuals undergoing
reduced intensity transplantation or receiving treat-
ment for disease relapse following transplantation. The
knowledge gained from this study will refine an under-
standing of the patient experience of transplant survi-
vors, generate testable hypotheses for future research,
direct priorities in the development, and testing of
supportive care interventions for survivors of allo-
geneic transplant.
