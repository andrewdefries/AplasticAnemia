INTRODUCTION
Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA-matc-
hed related donor is the treatment of choice for children and
young adults with severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Patients
without an appropriate sibling donor usually receive immuno-
suppressive therapy, and those who fail it, undergo BMT from
an HLA-matched unrelated donor. Umbilical cord blood tr-
ansplantation (UCBT) has become an alternative option in
various diseases since the first transplantation to treat a patient
with Fanconi anemia was successful in 1988 (1). However,
unrelated donor UCBT has not yet been recommended for
SAA patients due to the high risk of graft failure and com-
plications (2). Here we report the case of a girl who success-
fully underwent two-unit UCBT after engraftment failure
with a single unit.
CASE REPORT
A 3-yr-old girl, whose blood type was A+, was admitted
to our hospital for easy bruisibility. Her initial peripheral blood
cell count showed 3.28×109
/L white blood cell (WBC) with
2% neutrophils, 96% lymphocytes, 1% monocyte and 1%
eosinophil, 7.0 g/dL hemoglobin with 19.2% hematocrit,
0.8% reticulocyte and 5×109
/L platelet. A bone marrow
study revealed hypocellular marrow (10% to 20% cellulari-
ty) with a marked decrease of normal hematopoietic cells. This
led to the diagnosis of SAA. As the patient had no siblings,
she underwent immunosuppressive therapy with anti-lym-
phocyte globulin and cyclosporine A for six months without
response. Then she received oxymetholone and prednisolone
for three years with intermittent transfusions of more than
30 units of packed red blood cell (RBC) and 30 units of pla-
teletpheresis. However, oxymetholone was stopped because
she developed a hepatic adenoma. At seven years of age, a sin-
gle-unit UCBT from an AB+ male donor was performed with
5/6 HLA-matched unit, which contained 2.06×107
/kg nucle-
ated cells with 0.64×105
/kg CD34+
cells (Table 1). The con-
ditioning regimen was composed of fludarabine (180 mg/m2
),
busulfan (6.4 mg/kg), anti-thymocyte globulin (10 mg/kg)
and total lymphoid irradiation (2 Gy). Graft-versus-host dis-
ease (GVHD) prophylaxis was done with cyclosporine A and
methylprednisolone. The first UCBT failed due to an engraft-
ment failure.
Three months after the first UCBT, two-unit UCBT was

Successful Salvage Unrelated Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation
with Two Units After Engraftment Failure with Single Unit in Severe
Aplastic Anemia
Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) patients without an HLA-matched sibling donor need
alternative treatment options. Umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) has be-
come an alternative means for treating various diseases, but it has not been proved
to be a satisfactory method to treat SAA. Here, we report the case of a girl who un-
derwent successful two-unit UCBT after engraftment failure with a single unit. Two-
unit UCBT is proposed to have better engraftment potential and to offer a better
chance of survival, according to some reports. Increased cell dose and graft-ver-
sus-graft reaction could contribute to these advantages. With this promising result,
two-unit UCBT could be an alternative treatment option for patients with SAA with-
out an HLA-matched donor.

Two-unit Cord Blood Transplantation in Aplastic Anemia 745
conducted. Two units of cord blood were infused after con-
ditioning with fludarabine (180 mg/m2
), busulfan (6.4 mg/
kg) and total body irradiation (4 Gy). She received GVHD
prophylaxis with cyclosporine A and methylprednisolone.
Other supportive care was performed according to the guide-
lines for stem cell transplantation at our center (3, 4). The
engraftment was achieved with 6/6 HLA-matched unit con-
taining 2.27×107
/kg nucleated cells and 0.57×105
/kg
CD34+
cells. But the other 5/6 HLA-matched unit contain-
ing 2.21×107
/kg nucleated cells with 1.15×105
/kg CD34+
cells disappeared (Table 1). The engrafted unit came from
an A+ male donor, while the other was from a B+ male. The
number of days required to reach an absolute neutrophil count
more than 0.5×109
/L and 1.0×109
/L was 18 days and 22
days, respectively. Spontaneous platelet recovery to more than
20×109
/L and 50×109
/L required 112 and 123 days, respec-
tively. Complete donor chimerism was confirmed through
the analysis of short tandem repeat regions and fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) of XY chromosome (Table 2).
After transplantation, grade II acute GVHD developed
and was controlled with a steroid. She was also treated with
ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus antigenemia detected on
routine examination. Hepatic adenoma has been routinely
followed up with abdomen sonography and α-fetoprotein
without interval change. Up to two years and seven months
after the two-unit UCBT, complete donor chimerism has
been maintained with a normal blood cell count.
DISCUSSION
Since the first successful UCBT to treat a patient with Fan-
coni anemia in 1988 (1), UCBT has become an alternative
option to treat a number of malignant or nonmalignant hema-
tologic diseases. UCBT has the advantage of rapid availabil-
ity and low risk of severe acute GVHD. However, it has been
proposed that UCBT is limited by graft cell dose. Wagner
et al. (5) demonstrate the importance of graft CD34+
cell dose
in determining the outcome after unrelated donor UCBT.
To augment infused cell dose, ex vivo expansion of hematopoi-
etic stem cells and transplantation of multiple umbilical cord
blood units has been attempted.
In some studies, two-unit UCBT is proposed to have bet-
ter engraftment potential and to offer a better chance of sur-
vival than single unit UCBT (4, 6). Recently, there was a
report of a successful second transplantation with two unre-
lated cord blood units for early graft failure after first hemato-
poietic stem cell transplantation (7). The mechanisms of these
additional advantages of two-unit UCBT are not fully under-
stood. Increase of the cell dose could be a contributing factor,
and graft-versus-graft reaction between two units also could
be another factor. In previous reports on two-unit UCBT, re-
sults showed the dominancy of one unit in most of the cases.
The mechanism of determining the dominancy is not known
yet, but the number of CD3+
cells and degree of HLA mis-
match has been reported as related factors (4, 6).
In our case, the patient underwent a successful two-unit
UCBT after engraftment failure with a single-unit UCBT.
With this promising result, two-unit UCBT could be an alt-
ernative treatment option in SAA patients without an HLA-
matched donor. Also, further investigation about the mech-
anism of engraftment in two-unit UCBT may extend the
field of stem cell transplantation.
