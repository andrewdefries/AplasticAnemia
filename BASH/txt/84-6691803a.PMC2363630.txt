Human telomeres are regions at the chromosomal ends that play
an important role in the structure and function of chromosomes. In
normal somatic cells telomeres are shortened with every cell divi-
sion, and when a critical size is reached, cells lose their prolifera-
tive potential (Harley et al, 1990; Hastie et al, 1990; Harley, 1997).
Also in purified haematopoietic stem cells telomeric DNA appears
to shorten with each cell division and thus with age (Vaziri et al,
1994; Lansdorp, 1995). A number of studies have indicated a
possible accelerated shortening of telomere length in haemato-
poietic stem cells, due to proliferative stress following peripheral
blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) (Shapiro et al, 1996;
Notaro et al, 1997; Akiyama et al, 1998; Ball et al, 1998; Wynn
et al, 1998; Lee et al, 1999; Akiyama et al, 2000). Although low
levels of telomerase- a ribonucleoprotein that synthesizes telom-
eric DNA-can be determined in CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells,
this appears to be insufficient to compensate increased shortening
of telomere length (Notaro et al, 1997). Because of possible
negative long-term effects of this shortening, including possible
cytogenetic abnormalities (Ball et al, 1998; Ohyashiki et al, 1999),
genomic instability preceding myelodysplastic syndromes
(Ohyashiki et al, 1994) and reduced response following
haematopoietic stress (Rudolph et al, 1999), this is clearly of clin-
ical interest. However, most data so far are obtained from alloge-
netic transplantation settings (Notaro et al, 1997; Ball et al, 1998;
Wynn et al, 1998; Lee et al, 1999; Akiyama et al, 2000), in paedi-
atric patients. Fewer data are available on the effect of autologous
PBSCT (Shapiro et al, 1996; Akiyama et al, 1998; Lee et al, 1999;
Akiyama et al, 2000), while paired data including pre-treatment
samples are lacking.
As telomere length of nucleated blood cells was shown to be
widely variable between age-matched individuals (Notaro et al,
1997; Akiyama et al, 1998; Ball et al, 1998; Wynn et al, 1998; Lee et
al, 1999), prospective paired data are essential for determining the
impact of autologous PBSCT on this possible ageing process.
Therefore, we prospectively studied leukocyte telomere length and
telomerase activity in a group of high-risk breast cancer patients
randomized to receive either adjuvant standard-dose chemotherapy,
or adjuvant high-dose chemotherapy and PBSCT (De Vries et al,
1996). Paired samples before and after these treatments were
compared, allowing assessment of the impact of standard and high-
dose chemotherapy on telomere length and telomerase activity.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients included in this study participated in a national random-
ized adjuvant breast carcinoma study (De Vries et al, 1996).
Chemotherapy naive breast cancer patients with 4 or more tumour-
involved axillary lymph nodes (stage II and III), ≤55 years of age
with negative chest X-ray, liver ultrasound and bone scan, were
randomized to receive 5 courses of standard-dose chemotherapy

Summary High-dose chemotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) may accelerate telomere length loss in
haematopoietic stem cells. As data including pre-and post-treatment samples are lacking, we studied leukocyte telomere length and
telomerase activity before and after treatment in breast cancer patients randomized to receive 5 adjuvant courses FEC (5-FU, epirubicin and
cyclophosphamide) (n = 17), or 4 × FEC followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, carboplatin and autologous PBSCT (n = 16).
Haemoglobin, MCV, leukocyte-and platelet numbers were assessed prior to (t0
), 5 months after (t1
) and 9 months after chemotherapy (t2
);
these parameters were decreased at t1
and t2
compared to t0
(high-dose: all parameters; standard-dose: leukocytes and platelets), and all
parameters were lower after high-dose than standard-dose treatment at t1
. Paired individual leukocyte samples of t0
and t1
showed telomere
length change (determined by telomere restricted fragment (TRF) assay) ranging from +0.8 to –2.2 kb, with a decreased TRF length in 9
patients of both groups. Telomerase activity (determined by TRAP assay) was below detection limit in leukocyte samples of t0
and t1
. Thus,
standard-and high-dose chemotherapy negatively affect haematological reconstitution in this setting. In individual patients, telomere length
can be remarkably changed following haematological proliferative stress after treatment. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign

followed by radiotherapy, or 4 courses of the same combination
chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy, PBSCT and
radiotherapy. These groups will be referred to as the standard-dose
group, and the high-dose group, respectively. The combination
chemotherapy consisted of 5-fluorouracil (500 mg m–2
), epirubicin
(90 mg m–2
) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg m–2
), administered
intravenously once every 3 weeks. For the high-dose group, PBSC
were mobilized following the third or last course of FEC with
daily subcutaneous recombinant human granulocyte-colony stim-
ulating growth factor (rhG-CSF, 263 µg), from day 2 of the course.
Leucapheresis was performed from day 9 of this course, until
≥5.106
CD34+ cells kg–1
body weight (as determined by flow cyto-
metric analysis with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled anti-
CD34 antibody directed against the HPCA-2 epitope on
CD34+ cells, Becton Dickinson, Leiden, the Netherlands) were
obtained. High-dose chemotherapy consisted of cyclophos-
phamide (1500 mg m–2
), thiotepa (120 mg m–2
) and carboplatin
(400 mg m–2
) on days -6, -5, -4 and -3, followed by reinfusion of
PBSC on day 0. After reinfusion, daily subcutaneous rhG-CSF
was administered until the leukocyte count exceeded 3.109
l–1
.
Locoregional radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions) was adminis-
tered after completion of the chemotherapy scheme with sufficient
bone marrow recovery (defined as platelets >100.109
l–1
). Oral
tamoxifen 40 mg daily was administered after platelet recovery for
2 years, in both groups. The study, and the collection of blood
samples as described, was approved by the Medical Ethical
Committee of the University Hospital Groningen. All patients
gave informed consent.
Sampling times
Blood samples were collected from all consecutive patients
randomized in this study from May 1997 until January 1999.
Sampling times were: t0
: directly prior to start of chemotherapy; t1
:
5 months after completion of chemotherapy; t2
: 9 months after
completion of chemotherapy.
Telomere length was measured in samples from t0
and t1
. In a
number of these samples it was also possible to measure telomerase
activity. Haematological examinations, e.g. haemoglobin, mean
corpuscular volume (MCV), leukocytes, and platelets were
performed at t0
, t1
as well as t2
. Haematological parameters were
considered normal with haemoglobin ≥ 7.45 mmol l–1
, MCV
80–96 fl, leukocytes ≥ 4.0.109
l–1
and platelets ≥150.109
l–1
(Barbui
et al, 1996).
Analysis of telomere length
In blood samples from t0
and t1
, lysis of erythrocytes was
performed with an ammonium chloride solution (155 mM NH4
Cl,
10 mM potassium hydrogen carbonate, 0.1 mM sodium ethylene
diamine tetra acetate, EDTA). The remaining nucleated cell frac-
tion was then washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution
(0.14 M NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 6.4 mM Na2
HPO4
.2H2
O, 1.5 mM
KH2
PO4
, pH 7.4). After centrifugation (150 g, for 10 min) the
supernatant was decanted and 1.106
cells of the pellet of nucleated
cells were transferred onto a slide for assessment of the leukocyte
differentiation. The remaining pellet of nucleated cells was stored
at –80˚C. This erythrocyte lysis procedure was performed in
accordance with Wynn et al (1998).
In the nucleated leukocyte cell fraction, mean telomere length
was determined by the terminal restriction fragment (TRF) assay
according to Harley et al (1990), with minor modifications. DNA
was isolated using the salt extraction method as described by
Miller et al (1988). 5 µg DNA was digested overnight at 37˚C
using 20 U RsaI and 20 U HinfI (Roche Diagnostics, Almere, The
Netherlands). Digested DNA was electrophorexed in a 0.6%
agarose gel in 0.5× Tris-borate EDTA buffer overnight at 50 V.
DNA was depurinated with 0.25 M HCl, denatured in 0.5 M
NaOH and 1.5 M NaCl and neutralized in 0.5 M Tris/HCl
(pH = 7.5) and 1.5 M NaCl, after which the DNA was transferred
to a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Diagnostics,
Almere, The Netherlands) using 10× SSC overnight and dried for
2 hours at 80˚C. Prehybridization, hybridization with 5 ng ml–1
probe and washing were performed according to TeloQuant assay
(PharMingen, San Diego). Preincubation, incubation with 1:5000
alkaline phosphatase conjugated streptavidine and washing were
performed according to biotin luminescence detection kit instruc-
tions (Roche Diagnostics, Almere, The Netherlands). Telomeric
smears were visualized by incubation of the membrane with
the chemiluminescence substrate CPD-Star (1:100), according
to the supplied instructions (Tropix, Westburg, Leusden, the
Netherlands) and exposure to a film. Films were analysed using a
scanner and Diversity One PDI computer software (Pharmacia
Biotech, Roosendaal, the Netherlands). The mean TRF lengths
were calculated with the formula: mean TRF length =
∑(ODi
)/∑(ODi
/Li
), in which ODi
is the density output and Li
is the
length of the DNA at row i (normally a Gaussian curve was
obtained) (Wynn et al, 1998). For standardization, DNA isolated
from leukocytes (one sample) of one healthy donor was included
on all gels. The mean TRF length of the leukocytes of the donor
was 7.3 kb. TRF lengths from patient samples were normalized to
the TRF length of the healthy donor sample, which was set at 7.3
kb for each gel analysed. Paired patient samples were always
analysed on the same gel. The intra-assay variance coefficient in
this study was determined to be 1.4% (95% CI) after analysis of 10
aliquots of the control healthy donor sample on one gel, resulting
in a mean measurement variance for each sample of ± 100 bp.
Therefore, samples of individual patients with a difference in TRF
value < 0.2 kb were considered equal. As control, the plasmid
pTSK8 (linearized with Kpnl; a kind gift from Dr Royle, Leicester,
UK) was used, which contains approximately 200 base pairs (bp) of
TTAGGG repeats (Royle et al, 1992). TRF length change (∆ TRF
length) was defined as the TRF value at t1
minus the value at t0
.
Telomerase activity (the TRAP assay)
After obtaining the nucleated leukocyte cell fraction as described
above, 1.106
leukocytes per telomerase activity assay were lysed in
100 µl TRAP lysis buffer (0.5% CHAPS; 10 mM Tris/HCl
(pH7.5); 1 mM MgCl2
; 1 mM EGTA; 10% glycerol; 5 mM β-
mercaptoethanol; 0.1 mM PMSF) and incubated on ice for 25 min.
After centrifugation at 15 000 g for 20 min at 4˚C, the supernatant
was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80˚C until
further processing.
The TRAP assay was performed as previously described
(Wisman et al, 1998). In short, telomerase activity levels in leuko-
cytes were determined with a fluorescence-based telomeric repeat
amplification protocol assay using GLC4
cells (Zijlstra et al, 1987)
as standard in each assay. Peaks representing telomerase activity in
GLC4
cell equivalents were summed, then relatively expressed to
telomerase activity of 100 GLC4
cell equivalents (set at 100%) and
normalized to the signal of modified-internal telomerase assay

standard (M-ITAS). For the samples (1.105
cells and 1.104
cells)
the peaks representing telomerase activity were also summed and
normalized to the signal of M-ITAS, thereafter the relative
telomerase activity of the leukocytes was correlated to GLC4
cell
number (relative quantification comparable to 10 GLC4
cell equiv-
alents = 10 U).
Statistics
Mean TRF length and telomerase activity in blood samples from in
individual patients were compared from t0
and t1
, and statistically
analysed with the Wilcoxon signed ranks test for paired samples.
Comparisons of haematological parameters and leukocyte differ-
entiations between the standard-and high-dose groups, were
performed with the Student’s t-test for independent samples, and
comparisons between time points in both groups were performed
with the t-test for paired samples. Correlations between TRF data,
telomerase activity, numbers of CD34+ cells and haematological
examinations were examined with the Pearson correlation test. All
analyses were performed using the statistical analysis program
SPSS. A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Patients
The standard-dose group consisted of 17 patients, and the high-
dose group of 16. Mean age at the start of treatment was 44.0 years
(range 29–54 years) and 44.6 years (range 37–54 years) in these
groups respectively (NS). Mean period between blood samples of
t0
and t1
was 32 weeks in the standard-dose group, and 37 weeks in
the high-dose group (NS).
Haematological parameters
The analysis of haematological parameters is reflected in Figure 1.
Leukocytes
Compared to the standard-dose group, leukocyte counts were
lower in the high-dose group at t1
(standard-dose: mean at t1
5.9.109
l–1
, high-dose: mean 4.1.109
l–1
, P = 0.008; leukocytes <
4.0.109
l–1
in 2/17 versus 7/16 patients respectively). At t2
this
difference was not observed.
Compared to t0
, a decreased leukocyte count was shown at t1
in paired samples after both standard- and high-dose treatment
(P < 0.001); this difference remained present at t2
in both groups
(Figure 1A).
Platelets
Compared to the standard-dose group, platelet counts were lower
in the high-dose group at t1
(standard-dose: mean at t1
220.109
l–1
,
high-dose: mean 137.109
l–1
, P < 0.001; platelets < 150.109
l–1
in
0/17 versus 11/16 patients respectively). At t2
this difference was
not observed.
Compared to t0
, a decreased leukocyte count was shown at t1
in paired samples after both standard-and high-dose treatment
(P < 0.001); this difference remained present at t2
in both groups
(Figure 1B).
Haemoglobin
In the standard-dose group, haemoglobin values were not different
at t0
, t1
and t2
. Compared to the standard-dose group, haemoglobin
was lower in the high-dose group at t1
(standard-dose: mean at t1
8.0 mmol l–1
, high-dose: mean 6.7 mmol l–1
, P < 0.001; haemo-
globin < 7.45 mmol l–1
in 2/17 versus 14/16 patients respectively)
as well as at t2
(P = 0.003).
Compared to t0
, a decreased haemoglobin was observed at t1
in
paired samples after high-dose treatment (P < 0.001); this diffe-
rence remained present at t2
(Figure 1C).
MCV
In the standard-dose group, MCV values were not different at t0
, t1
and t2
. Compared to the standard-dose group, MCV values were
increased in the high-dose group at t1
(standard-dose: mean at t1
90.9 fl, high-dose: mean 97.9 fl, P < 0.001; MCV > 96 fl in 2/17
versus 10/16 patients respectively), but not at t2
.
Compared to t0
, an increased MCV value was observed at t1
in
paired samples after high-dose treatment (P < 0.001); this diffe-
rence remained present at t2
(Figure 1D).
CD34+ cell number and haematological parameters
At t1
in the high-dose group, the number of reinfused CD34+ cells
(times 106
per kg body weight) correlated positively with the
number of leukocytes (r = 0.63; P = 0.009) and platelets (r = 0.77;
P < 0.001), and negatively with MCV (r = –0.6, P = 0.014). No
relation between haemoglobin and CD34+ cells was found. At t2
,
no correlation between CD34+ cells and haematological parame-
ters was observed.
Telomere length and telomerase activity
TRF length (mean of all patients at t0
8.1 kb, SD 1.4) was in the
same range as previously reported in cross-sectional studies

(Akiyama et al, 1998; Ball et al, 1998; Wynn et al, 1998; Lee et al,
1999). As shown in Figure 2, TRF length decreased in 9 patients of
each group when t0
and t1
samples were compared, and 4 patients
from the standard-and 5 patients from the high-dose group showed
a TRF length increase (mean ∆ TRF length of both groups:
–0.2 kb, SD 0.6; range ∆ TRF length: standard-dose group: +0.4 to
–2.2 kb; high-dose group +0.8 to –1.1 kb). Paired analysis of t0
and
t1
samples showed overall no effect on TRF length of either treat-
ment arm (standard-dose group: P = 0.069; high-dose group:
P = 0.67) or of treatment in general (both groups together:
P = 0.148). A representative blot is shown in Figure 3. No differ-
ence in leukocyte differentiation was found when t0
and t1
samples
were compared of both groups, and no difference between the
groups was observed at t0
or t1
.
In the high-dose group, no correlation between reinfused
CD34+ cells and actual TRF length at t1
, or ∆ TRF length could be
observed (Figure 4).
Also the relation between haematological parameters haemo-
globin, MCV, leukocyte and platelet counts at t1
and t2
and TRF
length, or ∆ TRF length was evaluated. No correlation between
these haematological parameters and (∆) TRF length could be
observed.
In 9 patients from each group, paired leukocyte sample size also
allowed measurement of telomerase activity at t0
and t1
. This
included the samples with maximum TRF length increase or
decrease of both groups. Telomerase activity in all of these patient
samples was below the reliable detection limit of 10 U (equivalent
to 10 GLC4 cells) per 1.105
leukocytes (Wisman et al, 1998), in
both groups at t0
and t1
. This activity level is comparable with
telomerase activity found in leukocytes from healthy controls
(Wolthers et al, 1999). Therefore, no strong up-regulation of
telomerase activity was observed, also not in patients with
increased TRF lengths after treatment.
DISCUSSION
The perception that haematopoietic proliferative stress may acce-
lerate the ageing of haematopoietic stem cells has gained interest, in
view of the widespread use of haematopoietic stem cell transplan-
tations for various clinical conditions. Evidence for accelerated
telomere shortening after haematopoietic stem cell transplanta-
tions was found in a number of studies (Shapiro et al, 1996;
Notaro et al, 1997; Akiyama et al, 1998; Ball et al, 1998; Wynn et
al, 1998; Lee et al, 1999; Akiyama et al, 2000). Most data were
derived from paediatric patients with haematological malignan-
cies, and frequently mean TRF lengths after therapy were
compared to mean TRF lengths of age-matched controls.
However, mean TRF length of nucleated blood cells has been
shown to be widely variable between these controls (Notaro et al,
1997; Akiyama et al, 1998; Ball et al, 1998; Wynn et al, 1998;
Lee et al, 1999). Additionally, samples were drawn at a wide
range of time after PBSCT, ranging from 1.6 months (Lee et al,
1999) to over 10 years (Akiyama et al, 1998; Wynn et al, 1999).
Finally, as TRF dynamics were shown to be different in the
various stages of life (Zeichner et al, 1999), predictive value for
the adult setting may not automatically be assumed from these
paediatric data. Therefore, we studied mean leukocyte TRF
length in paired samples before and after treatment, in a group of
high-risk breast cancer patients randomized to receive either

adjuvant standard-dose chemotherapy, or adjuvant high-dose
chemotherapy and PBSCT. These treatment modalities are
frequently used for breast cancer (Antman et al, 1997), and their
induction of haematopoietic stress and possible consequent effect
on individual TRF length could be assessed. TRF length measure-
ment in this study was performed based on the commonly used
procedure by Harley et al (1990), and care was taken to stan-
dardize measurements. In analogy to the pioneering study by
Wynn et al (1998), we chose unselected leukocytes to measure
TRF length and telomerase activity in. In recent studies, it has
been suggested that lymphocytes may have a larger TRF length
than neutrophils (Wynn et al, 1999; Robertson et al, 2000).
Although TRF length of T lymphocytes and neutrophils was
shown to be equally affected by stem cell transplantation (Wynn
et al, 1999), in case of a change in the relative proportions of these
cells, it might be slightly more difficult to draw conclusions from
overall leukocyte TRF length. However, in this study no diffe-
rence in the leukocyte differentiations was found in either group
before or after treatment, and TRF length in our leukocyte
samples is therefore unlikely to be affected by such a difference.
Furthermore, variable differences of TRF length of neutrophils
and T lymphocytes have been reported, ranging from approxi-
mately 1 kb (Wynn et al, 1999) to none (Martens et al, 2000). In
light of these data, we consider leukocytes, in line with Wynn et al
(1998), sufficient for the purpose of this study.
Haematopoietic proliferative stress to achieve haematological
reconstitution after treatment, was analysed by means of haemato-
logical parameters in peripheral blood, until 9 months after treat-
ment. A clear negative effect on all haematological parameters was
seen after high-dose treatment, and 9 months later still no recovery
was made to the pre-treatment level. Even after standard-dose treat-
ment, leukocyte and platelet counts were significantly affected for
at least 9 months. A long-term impact of PBSCT on haematological
reconstitution was observed in haematological malignancies
(Barbui et al, 1996). Our data appear to support this in the solid
tumour setting also, but data from longer follow-up periods are
needed to confirm this. In line with previous studies (Faucher et al,
1996; Bernstein et al, 1998), we found that the number of reinfused
CD34+ cells correlated with leukocyte and platelet numbers as well
as MCV values, shortly after high-dose treatment.
Following the evident haematopoietic stress induced by both
treatment arms (and PBSCT in particular), TRF length was clearly
changed in individual patients. The majority of patients (n = 9 in
both arms) showed a TRF length decrease at t1
, but also remark-
able TRF length increases were observed; no significant decrease
due to either treatment was found in paired samples. The high-dose
treatment scheme used in this study is classically combined with
stem cell support in view of its profound myolotoxicity, causing
prolonged life threatening marrow aplasia (Ayash et al, 1993;
Antman et al, 1994). It is possible that in individual patients the
lack of TRF length decrease due to treatment may be interpreted as
a sign of insufficient treatment toxicity, as stem cells remaining in
the patient after high-dose treatment will have an impact on the
requirements to divide for haematopoietic reconstitution. In line
with the presumed ablative nature of the treatment regimen in our
study however, its profound impact on haematological parameters
is clear. The maximum myelosuppression at t1
and the (partial)
haematological recovery at t2
, indicate haematopoietic prolifera-
tive stress at the time-point at which TRF length was measured
(at t1
). Full recovery of haematological parameters after this high-
dose treatment may actually take years (Nieboer et al, 2000), and
the impact of this lengthy process on TRF length changes at later
time-points than t1
is currently being studied.
The detection of a distinct increase of TRF length in some
patients was surprising. We hypothesized that up-regulation of
telomerase activity in response to replicative stress might be
responsible for this, in agreement with in vitro studies with puri-
fied CD34+ cells (Engelhardt et al, 1997; Yui et al, 1999).
However, in our samples telomerase activity remained unde-
tectable after treatment. In drawing conclusions from this, it
should be considered that telomerase activity is a much more
dynamic parameter than TRF length. Possibly, telomerase activity
changes took place at other time-points than were measured in this
study. Furthermore, in contrast to the comparable TRF length of
leukocytes and CD34+ cells (Kronenwett et al, 1996), telomerase
activity in purified CD34+ cells is likely higher than in terminally
differentiated cells such as leukocytes (Engelhardt et al, 1997).
CD34+ cell numbers in our study were not related to (∆) TRF
length. Previously, it was assumed that if small numbers of CD34+
cells are reinfused, these cells may have to undergo more cell divi-
sions than larger numbers, for a similar net haematopoietic effect
(Notaro et al, 1997). However, no relationship was found between
the degree of TRF length shortening and the number of reinfused
CD34+ cells in recent studies (Lee et al, 1999; Wynn et al, 1999)
and our data support this. Possibly, in vitro culturing of CD34+
cells may provide more insight into the balance between cell
proliferation and the ability to upregulate telomerase activity in
individuals, leading to (change of) telomere length in vivo.
Disturbances in this balance may be related to haematological
malignancies (Engelhardt et al, 2000). In this respect, the ability to
measure TRF length in individual chromosomes or cells by means
of flow cytometry (Rufer et al, 1998) or in situ hybridization
(Martens et al, 2000) may be of interest. It remains conceivable
that a rapid TRF decrease, predisposes for long-term effects such
as secondary malignancies in individual patients. This has to be
evaluated after a longer period of follow-up.
In conclusion, in this study we found that standard-and high-
dose chemotherapy (in particular) negatively affect haematolo-
gical reconstitution. Leukocyte TRF length was remarkably
changed in individual patients after treatment, showing both
decrease (in the majority of patients), as well as increase.
Therefore, although no accelerated telomere loss was observed in
general, TRF length was clearly affected following proliferative
stress in this setting.
