ITD-Flt3 mutations are detected in leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. While antagonizing
Survivin normalizes ITD-Flt3-induced acute leukemia, it also impairs hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function, indicating that
identiﬁcation of diﬀerences in signaling pathways downstream of Survivin between LSC and HSC are crucial to develop selective
Survivin-based therapeutic strategies for AML. Using a Survivin-deletion model, we identiﬁed 1,096 genes regulated by Survivin
in ITD-Flt3-transformed c-kit+, Sca-1+, and lineageneg (KSL) cells, of which 137 are deregulated in human LSC. Of the 137, 124
genes were regulated by Survivin exclusively in ITD-Flt3+ KSL cells but not in normal CD34neg KSL cells. Survivin-regulated genes
in LSC connect through a network associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway and falls into various
functional categories independent of eﬀects on apoptosis. Pathways downstream of Survivin in LSC that are distinct from HSC
can be potentially targeted for selective anti-LSC therapy.
1. Introduction
Survivin has been implicated in regulation of apoptosis,
cell division, and cell cycle both in cancer cells and nor-
mal tissues, through caspase-dependent and -independent
mechanisms [1–3]. We previously showed that Survivin is
expressed and growth factor regulated in human CD34+ cells
[4–6]. Antagonizing Survivin impairs production of mouse
bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro [4, 7]
and conditional Survivin gene deletion in vivo in mice leads
to bone marrow ablation as a result of loss of hematopoietic
stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) [8]. In contrast to tight
regulation of Survivin by hematopoietic growth factors in
normal CD34+ cells, deregulated expression of Survivin
is frequently observed in hematological diseases, particu-
larly those associated with hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
expansion. For instance, Survivin is aberrantly overexpressed
in acute myeloid leukemia [9, 10] but downregulated in
marrow cells of patients with aplastic anemia where HSPC
are signiﬁcantly reduced [11]. These ﬁndings suggest that
Survivin regulates HSPC fate under normal and pathological
conditions.
We previously reported that ITD-Flt3 mutations found
in ∼25–30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) and strongly associated with poor prognosis [12–14],
increase expression of Survivin. Survivin mediates aberrant
hematopoietic cell proliferation induced by ITD-Flt3 and
regulates development of ITD-Flt3+ acute leukemia, sug-
gesting that antagonizing Survivin may provide therapeutic
beneﬁt for patients with AML expressing ITD-Flt3 [14]. Sur-
vivin is the fourth most highly expressed transcript in cancer
[15] and is commonly associated with a higher proliferative
index, reduced apoptosis, resistance to chemotherapy and
increased rate of tumor recurrence in cancer cells, making
anti-Survivin therapy an attractive strategy in cancer [3].
Several anti-Survivin preclinical trials in solid tumor models
2 Journal of Oncology
show that disrupting Survivin can reduce tumor growth [1–
3]. However, studies from our group and others indicate
that Survivin regulates normal HSPC [4, 7, 8], suggesting
that targeting Survivin will likely result in hematopoietic
toxicity. Therefore, identiﬁcation of diﬀerences in signaling
cascades downstream of Survivin between normal HSPC and
cancer stem cells (CSC) or leukemia stem cells (LSC) are
required to pinpoint targets that can eﬀectively eradicate
CSC/LSC with little toxicity on HSC. Previous reports show
that ITD-Flt3 mutations are present in human LSC [13]
and genes expressed in AML stem cells are deregulated
[16]. The primary purpose of this study was to identify
downstream Survivin signaling pathways in LSC that are
distinct from normal HSC. Using ITD-Flt3 transformed c-
kit+, Sca-1+, and lineageneg (KSL) cells from conditional
Survivin knockout mice as surrogates for AML stem cells and
littermate controls, we identiﬁed a panel of genes that are
speciﬁcally regulated by Survivin in ITD-Flt3 transformed
KSL cells and known to be deregulated in human LSC.
The data identify selective signaling pathways downstream of
Survivin in LSC that are distinct from normal HSC that can
be potentially targeted for selective anti-LSC therapy.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Antibodies and Cytokines. Anti-Fcγ-III/II receptor anti-
body, APC conjugated antimouse c-kit (clone 2B8), biotin-
conjugated anti-Sca-1 (E13-161.7), R-Phycoerythrin (PE)
conjugated anti-mouse CD3 (clone 143-2C11), GR-1 (clone
RB6-8C5), B220 (clone RA3-6B2), Mac1 (clone M1/70),
Ter119 (clone Ter119), rat IgG2a, rat IgG2b, hamster IgG,
and Streptavidin-PE-Cy7 were purchased from BD Bio-
sciences (San Diego, CA). Recombinant human Flt3 ligand
(FL) and Thrombopoietin (Tpo) were provided by Amgen,
Thousand Oaks, CA. Recombinant murine stem cell factor
(rmSCF) was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis,
MN). Tamoxifen and 4-hydroxy (4OH) tamoxifen were from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
2.2. Cell Culture, Plasmid Transfection, Retrovirus Transduc-
tion, and In Vitro Survivin Gene Deletion. Mice with the
Survivin gene ﬂanked by loxP sites and a Tamoxifen-
inducible form of Cre (Cre-ER) were reported previously
[14]. All mice were housed in microisolators with continuous
access to rodent chow and acidiﬁed water. The Indiana Uni-
versity School of Medicine IACUC approved all experimental
procedures. Retrovirus transduction of ITD-Flt3 into mouse
bone marrow cells was carried out as described [14]. Brieﬂy,
bone marrow cells from littermate control Survivinﬂox/ﬂox or
CreER-Survivinﬂox/ﬂox mice were transduced with ITD-Flt3
(N51) in MSCV-IRES-EGFP vector [17]. Seventy-two hours
after sequential transduction, the medium was replaced with
IMDM containing 10% FBS and the cells were incubated for
14 days without growth factors in the presence of 1uM of
4OH-Tamoxifen to induce Survivin gene deletion. All cells
were cultured in triplicates in two independent experiments.
Viable cells were enumerated using trypan blue exclusion and
GFP+, c-kit+, Sca-1+, and lineage negative (KSL) cells were
sorted on day 14 by FACSAria (BD Biosciences). Sorted cells
were immediately lysed and subjected to diﬀerential mRNA
microarray analysis.
2.3. In Vivo Survivin Deletion. Survivinﬂox/ﬂox and CreER-
Survivinﬂox/ﬂox mice were treated with 5 mg Tamoxifen
(5 mg/mouse i.p.) for 3 consecutive days and allowed to rest
for 3 days, and Tamoxifen was administered for 3 additional
days. Fourteen days after the ﬁnal Tamoxifen injection,
marrow cells were harvested, stained with anti-CD34, c-kit,
Sca-1, and lineage markers and CD34neg KSL cells isolated by
FACSAria for mRNA microarray analysis.
2.4. mRNA Microarray. Sorted cells were immediately lysed
and subjected to diﬀerential mRNA microarray analysis.
Microarray analysis was performed on a fee basis by Miltenyi
Biotec (Auburn, CA). Brieﬂy, 250 nanograms of each cDNA
were used as template for Cy3 and Cy5 labeling which
was performed according to Miltenyi Biotec’s proprietary
protocol. Equal amounts of labeled cDNAs from Tamoxifen-
treated Survivinﬂox/ﬂox and CreER-Survivinﬂox/ﬂox mice or
those cells expressing ITD-Flt3 were hybridized overnight
(17 hours, 65◦
C) to Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Oligo
Microarrays (44 K) according to the manufacturers’ pro-
tocol. Fluorescence signals of the hybridized microarrays
were detected using Agilent’s DNA microarray scanner
(Agilent, Palo Alto, USA). The Agilent Feature Extraction
Software (FES) was used to read out and process the
microarray image ﬁles. The software determines feature
intensities and ratios (including background subtraction
and normalization), rejects outliers, and calculates statistical
conﬁdences (P-values). For determination of diﬀerential
gene expression, FES derived output data ﬁles were fur-
ther analyzed using the Rosetta Resolverˆa gene expression
data analysis system (Rosetta Biosoftware, Seattle, USA).
Signiﬁcantly regulated genes were annotated and assigned to
functional categories using the DAVID 2008 (the Database
for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery;
http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp) program [18]. Func-
tional networks of the genes regulated by Survivin was visu-
alized using Cytoscape software: http://www.cytoscape.org/
[19].
3. Results
3.1. Reduction in Proliferation ITD-Flt3 Transformed KSL
Cells by Survivin Deletion Is Associated with Alteration of
Expression of 1,096 Genes Classiﬁed into Various Biological
Functions. While incubation of marrow cells transduced
with wild-type Flt3 in IMDM containing 10% FBS without
hematopoietic any growth factors failed to support KSL
proliferation, overexpression of ITD-Flt3-EGFP in primary
mouse bone marrow cells results in the ability of KSL cells to
proliferate in the same culture condition without additional
any hematopoietic growth factors as we reported, indicating
that ITD-Flt3 is suﬃcient to transform primitive HSPC [14].
Incubation of ITD-Flt3 transduced marrow cells derived
from CreER-Survivinﬂox/ﬂox mice with 1uM 4OH-Tamoxifen
signiﬁcantly reduced factor-independent KSL cells on day 14

Figure 1: The eﬀect of Survivin deletion on the number of KSL cells transformed by ITD-Flt3 (a) The KSL cells transformed by ITD-Flt3
were FACS sorted using GFP as a marker. Marrow cells derived from littermate control Survivinﬂox/ﬂox or CreER-Survivinﬂox/ﬂox mice were
transduced with ITD-Flt3 (N51) in MSCV-IRES-EGFP vector. Seventy-two hours after transduction, the medium was replaced with IMDM
containing 10%FBS and the cells were incubated for 14 days in the presence of 1uM of 4OH-Tamoxifen without hematopoietic growth
factors. GFP+, c-kit+, Sca-1+, and lineage-negative (KSL) cells shown in red box were sorted on day 14 by FACSAria (BD Biosciences).

manner (Figure 1), conﬁrming that Survivin is required for
factor independent growth of ITD-Flt3 transformed KSL
cells.
To investigate the mechanism by which Survivin reg-
ulates aberrant proliferation of ITD-Flt3 transformed KSL
cells, mRNA expression was compared between ITD-Flt3
transformed Survivinﬂox/ﬂox and CreER-Survivinﬂox/ﬂox KSL
using mRNA microarrays. Although inhibition of Survivin
mRNA expression in CreER-Survivinﬂox/ﬂox KSL cells by
4OH-Tamoxifen was only 50% compared to control, the
mRNA microarray identiﬁed 1,096 transcripts diﬀerentially
regulated by Survivin. These genes were classiﬁed based
on biological process and molecular function deﬁned by
Gene Ontology Term (http://www.geneontology.org/) using
DAVID 2008 program (Figure 2). Representative groups for
biological process include phosphate metabolic process, cell
cycle, cell division, response to DNA damage stimulus, RNA
biosynthetic process and transcription (Figure 2(a), P <
.02). Ion-binding, nucleotide-binding, DNA-binding, and
protein kinase activity were the top 4 signiﬁcantly enriched
categories in molecular function deﬁned by Gene Ontology
database (Figure 2(b), P < .02). The list of genes classiﬁed by
biological process and molecular function are listed in sup-
plementary Table S1 available at doi:10.1155/2011/946936.
3.2. Survivin Modulates Expression of Genes Deregulated in
Human AML LSC. The requirement of Survivin for the self-
renewing capability of ITD-Flt3 transformed KSL cells or
CFU [14] and the presence of ITD-Flt3 in LSC [13] strongly
suggests that Survivin is important for LSC fate decisions
resulting from deregulated gene expression. We compared
1,096 diﬀerentially expressed genes in Survivin deleted ITD-
Flt3+KSL cells with the existing deregulated gene expression
database for human AML stem cells [16]. Out of 1,096 genes
regulated by Survivin in KSL cells transformed by ITD-Flt3,
137 genes are also listed in the deregulated molecules
in human AML stem cells (Tables 1(a)–1(d)) [16]. The
relationship between Survivin and LSC on the modulation

Figure 2: Classiﬁcation of the Survivin regulated genes in ITD-Flt3 transformed KSL cells. The 1,096 genes identiﬁed by Survivin gene
deletion were classiﬁed into biological process (a) and molecular function (b) deﬁned by Gene Ontology (GO) Term using DAVID program
(P < .02). Genes for which annotations could not be assigned were excluded. Representative functional categories are shown in the ﬁgures
because of redundancies in classiﬁcation categories. The complete Gene ID and annotations are listed in Supplementary Table S1 available
at doi:10.1155/2011/946936.
of the gene expression is illustrated in Figure 3(a). Of the 137
genes identiﬁed, 79 genes were downregulated by Survivin
deletion while 58 genes were upregulated, implying that
these genes are conversely increased and decreased by the
presence of Survivin in LSC (Figure 3(a)). In contrast, 92
genes were upregulated and 45 genes were downregulated by
LSC. Among the 79 genes downregulated genes by Survivin
deletion, 55 transcripts were upregulated (Figure 3(a) and
Table 1(a)) whereas 24 genes were downregulated by LSC
(Figure 3(a) and Table 1(c)). Similarly, out of 58 upregulated
transcripts by Survivin deletion, 21 genes were downregu-
lated (Figure 3(a) and Table 1(b)) and 37 genes were upreg-
ulated in LSC (Figure 3(a) and Table 1(d)) (Figure 3(a)).
Next, we classiﬁed the 137 genes into functional anno-
tation groups using the DAVID program (P < .05,
Figure 3(b)). Signiﬁcantly enriched functional groups were
annotated as phosphoprotein, nucleus, acetylation, cell cycle,
ATP binding, regulation of EGF signaling pathway, cell
adhesion and others. The size of each circle in Figure 3(b)
represents the number of genes involved in each functional
category and the thickness of the line indicates the number
of genes shared with any function, suggesting enrichment
of the gene groups with functional redundancy. Among
the molecules most frequently shared within the functional
groups include BGLAP, Chrac1, Hmgb1 and Smarce1.
Similarly, 76 genes upregulated or downregulated both by
Survivin and LSC (55 + 21 genes shown in Figure 1(a))
were functionally classiﬁed (Figure 3(c)). Phosphoprotein,
acetylation, DNA binding, ATP binding and DNA replication
were signiﬁcantly enriched.
The 1,096 diﬀerentially Survivin-regulated genes were
also searched against the list of genes expressed in mouse
HSC [20]. We identiﬁed 94 diﬀerentially expressed genes
in the list of genes that include HSC. There were 45 genes
whose expression was selectively enriched in HSC compared
to other populations (Table 2). Crem, Emp1, Hmga2, Lrrn1,
Maﬀ, Myef2, Rps4x, and Sos1 listed in HSC database are
also deregulated in LSC. We next compared the human
LSC associated 137 genes regulated by Survivin in ITD-
Flt3+KSL cells with diﬀerentially regulated genes in normal
bone marrow CD34neg KSL cells obtained from CreER-
Survivinﬂox/ﬂox and control Survivinﬂox/ﬂox mice following
Survivin deletion. Tamoxifen reduced Survivin expression
by 10-fold in CD34neg KSL cells from CreER-Survivinﬂox/ﬂox
mice compared to control Survivinﬂox/ﬂox in two independent
experiments. Out of 137 genes, Arg2, Med25, Pmaip1, Pola2,
Ube3b, Ephb2 and Rab18 were diﬀerentially regulated in
both ITD-Flt3+KSL cells and normal CD34neg KLS cells by
Survivin deletion. In contrast, Cenpa, Cpd, Myef2, Nmt2,
Taf1b and Tmpo were downregulated in ITD-Flt3+KSL cells
while they were upregulated in normal CD34neg KSL cells by
Survivin deletion. These ﬁndings suggest that the 124 genes
are regulated by Survivin exclusively in ITD-Flt3+KSL cells
but not in CD34neg KSL cells. The complete list of the genes
regulated by Survivin in CD34neg KSL cells will be reported
elsewhere (manuscript in preparation).

3.3. Survivin Modulates Gene Expression in LSC That Con-
nects Through a Functional Signaling Network Associated
with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Signaling Pathway.
Functional annotation analysis indicates that genes related
with dorsoventral axis formation or epidermal growth factor
receptor signaling pathway (EGFR) are signiﬁcantly enriched
in the shared genes associated with LSC and Survivin
signaling in KEGG database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/)
(P < .03). Similarly, genes associated with regulation of
EGFR signaling pathway are enriched in the Gene Ontology
database (P < .02). Our analysis shows that 13 molecules
shared by LSC and Survivin signaling are mapped on a
functional signaling network that connects through the
EGFR pathway (Figure 4).
4. Discussion
Survivin deletion in ITD-Flt3 transformed KSL cells results
in a signiﬁcant reduction in growth factor-independent pro-
liferation coincident with growth inhibition. Our data shows
that Survivin deletion modulates gene expression of 1,096
genes that are associated with various cellular and metabolic
functions. Comparison of the 1,096 Survivin regulated genes
in ITD-Flt3+KSL cells with 3,005 diﬀerentially regulated
genes in the human AML stem cell database identiﬁed
137 shared genes. Functional classiﬁcation of these 137
genes indicates they connect through a functional signaling
network associated with EGFR signaling pathway and aﬀect
various biological and molecular processes. Comparison of
the 137 Survivin-regulated genes in LSC with transcripts
regulated by Survivin in normal CD34neg KSL cells show
that 124 genes are regulated by Survivin exclusively in ITD-
Flt3+KSL cells and not in normal HSC. These data suggest
that Survivin contributes to deregulation of gene expression
in AML stem cells via selective signaling pathways distinct
from normal HSC that can be potentially targeted for
therapeutic beneﬁt.
There is no direct evidence that Survivin directly reg-
ulates gene transcription; however, modulation of Survivin
can clearly aﬀect transcription in cancer cells [21–23] and
transgenic expression of Survivin alters the expression of
multiple genes in the bladder [24].
The involvement of Survivin in transcriptional regula-
tion is consistent with the fact that Bir1, a Caenorhabditis

and Survivin in ITD-Flt3+KSL cells. Arrow bars in the quadrant indicate the direction of gene regulation by Survivin or LSC. The top-
right corner shows 55 genes upregulated by both LSC and Survivin (downregulated by Survivin gene deletion), whereas bottom-left corner
represents 21 genes downregulated by both LSC and Survivin (upregulated by Survivin gene deletion). The top left corner shows 24 genes

genes shown in Figure 3(a)) were functionally classiﬁed by DAVID software and visualized by Cytoscapse program as shown in Figure 3(b).

elegans homologue of Survivin, regulates transcription, most
likely through Histone phosphorylation by Aurora kinase
[25]. Survivin is essential for activation of Aurora kinase
that phosphorylates Histone H3 [26, 27], an event required
for transcriptional regulation [28–30] and cytokinesis [31],
suggesting that Survivin may regulate transcription via
Aurora kinase mediated Histone H3 phosphorylation. Over
expression of Survivin also leads to phosphorylation of
the Sp1 transcription factor [21]. Since microarray analysis
was performed on lineage marker negative viable cells that
express GFP, c-kit, and Sca-1 and survived in culture, it
is unlikely that the eﬀects of Survivin on gene expression
is a consequence of KSL apoptosis, although we cannot
rule out indirect eﬀects resulting from cell cycle arrest as a
consequence of Survivin deletion.
Survivin is known to inhibit caspases 3, 7, and 10 that
mediate apoptosis [1–3]. Our functional annotation analysis
of the genes regulated by Survivin indicates that Survivin
modulates a number of genes that aﬀect multiple biological
processes and molecular functions, although inhibition of
Survivin mRNA expression in CreER-Survivinﬂox/ﬂox KSL
cells by 4OH-Tamoxifen was only 50% compared to control.
While incompleteness of the gene deletion may aﬀect
the downstream signals, signiﬁcant reduction of total cell
number was observed. Since Survivin deletion induces cell
death, the deleted cells are likely no longer present in the
culture at the time of cell harvest for analyses, resulting
in an underestimate of the eﬃciency of Survivin gene
deletion and likely represents Survivin expression in cells
that have escaped the Tamoxifen-induced deletion. The
genes aﬀected by Survivin deletion were classiﬁed into
cell cycle, adhesion, DNA replication, transcriptional factor
binding, acetylation, phosphorylation, and polymerase. We
did not observe changes in genes that mediate apoptosis.
These results suggest that Survivin can regulate ITD-Flt3
transformed KSL cell fate independent of its activity as a
caspase inhibitor. More importantly, comparison of the 1,096
Survivin regulated genes in ITD-Flt3+KLS cells with the

Figure 4: Genes regulated by Survivin in ITD-Flt3+KSL cells and deregulated in LSC are mapped on functional signaling network associated
with epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway. Epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway (EGFR) is signiﬁcantly
enriched in the shared genes associated with LSC and Survivin signaling by pathway enrichment analysis in KEGG and Gene Ontology
database. Our analysis shows that 13 molecules shared by LSC and Survivin signaling are mapped on a functional signaling network
associated with EGFR. The network was created based on KEGG database using Cytoscape software. Green circle and red circle represents

human AML stem cell database demonstrates that 137 genes
(12.4%) modulated by Survivin are also deregulated in LSCs.
Functional annotation analysis indicates that genes related
to dorsoventral axis formation or epidermal growth factor
receptor signaling pathway (EGFR) are signiﬁcantly enriched
in the shared genes associated with LSC and Survivin
signaling, even though the number of molecules detected
that associates with EGFR signaling is small. EGFR signaling
activates signaling cascades involved in cell proliferation,
such as Src, Sos, and MAP-kinases, and is known to be
dysregulated in solid tumors [32, 33]. Our data also indicates
that Survivin modulates expression of several genes that
connect through the EGFR signaling pathway (Figure 4),
suggesting a potential role of EGFR signaling downstream
of Survivin in AML stem cells, despite the fact that EGFR is
not usually upregulated in AML cells [34]. However, recent
studies indicate an antineoplastic eﬀect of an EGFR inhibitor
in AML via oﬀ-target eﬀects [34, 35]. Thus, our data would
support EGFR signaling as a candidate pathway for treatment
of patients with AML.
While Survivin is not listed in the LSC database [16],
it is expressed at higher levels in AML cells compared to
normal CD34+ cells [9, 10]. Our data clearly show that
Survivin aﬀects expression of 137 genes associated with LSC
and reduces aberrant KSL proliferation induced by ITD-
Flt3. This ﬁnding suggests that antagonizing Survivin in LSC
may normalize expression of the deregulated genes, which in
turn can inhibit their aberrant proliferation. Since Survivin

is expressed and regulated in normal CD34+ cells [4, 6] and
antagonizing Survivin reduces normal HSPC in vivo [8], it
is likely that Survivin deletion will aﬀect normal HSC in
the patients. Although direct comparison of gene expression
in in vitro ITD-Flt3+KSL cells with in vivo CD34neg KSL
cells may not necessarily provide deﬁnite diﬀerences in
Survivin signaling between these populations in vivo, we
found that 124 out of 137 Survivin associated genes shared
by ITD-Flt3+KSL cells and human LSC were not regulated
in normal CD34neg KSL cells by Survivin. This disparity
of downstream signaling of Survivin between normal and
transformed HSC may represent as a means of identifying
novel therapeutic targets against LSC that would thereby
supplant direct Survivin disruption which would otherwise
toxic to normal HSC.
5. Conclusion
We identiﬁed genes regulated by Survivin in ITD-Flt3
transformed KSL cells that are deregulated in human AML
stem cells that are distinct from normal HSC. This study
will facilitate the identiﬁcation of speciﬁc therapeutic targets
downstream of Survivin to eradicate LSC without aﬀecting
normal HSC.
