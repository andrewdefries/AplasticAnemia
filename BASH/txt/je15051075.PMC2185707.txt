MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX-RESTRICTED
ANTIBODY REACTIVITY MAINLY, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY,
DIRECTED AGAINST CELLS FROM MALE DONORS*

Extensive studies in the mouse have shown that cell-mediated lympholysis can
occur against virus-infected (1) or chemically modified (2) target cells if the cytolytic
effector cell shares an H-2 determinant with the target cell. The same holds true for
the minor histocompatibility antigens such as H-Y (3, 4). More recent studies have
shown that the same phenomenon can be observed in man. Our group has described
a patient (Mrs. R.) suffering from aplastic anemia whose lymphocytes were able to
kill the lymphoeytes of her HLA-identical brother and all other HLA-A2-positive
males (5). Cells from HLA-A2-negative males and all females (with two possible
exceptions, vide infra) were not killed.
When the serum of Mrs. R. (serum R.) 1was tested for the presence of lympholytic
antibodies it was found that complement-dependent cytolytic antibodies were present
that reacted with part of the cells stained with anti-Ig fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC). It appeared ,possible that this antibody recognized a hitherto undescribed,
possibly non-HLA specificity.
In this article we will describe the results obtained so far with the serum R. This
serum demonstrates the presence of an antibody with an almost perfect correlation
with HLA-A2-restricted H-Y killing in the cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) test
described by Goulmy et al. (6). This serum is unique because it is the first example of
an HLA-A2-restricted antibody directed against a non-HLA antigen. We will show
furthermore that this serum reacts only with part of the mononuclear cells from
peripheral blood and that the antibody in it can be found in the IgM fraction.
Materials and Methods
Serum. The serum R. used for the experiments was obtained from a female patient suffering
from apiastic anemia. She was 46 yr old and married. From five pregnancies, two boys and
three girls were delivered. From March 25th, 1975 until April 25th, 1975 she received 19 buffy
coat-free blood transfusions and from March 14th, 1975 until May 1st, 1975, she received 40
platelet transfusions.

From these platelet transfusions, 36 were donaled by male donors. Her HLA type is HLA-
A2, B40, Bw6, Cw3, DRw6/A2, BI2, Bw4, DRw4. On May 9th, 1975 she received a bone
marrow graft from her HLA-identical brolher after anti-lymphocyte globulin (ALG) pretreat-
ment. There was a temporary take, but the graft was rejected after 20 d. The serum we used for
the experiments to be described, however, was obtained before the bone marrow transplantation.
Cells. Mononuclear cells were obtained from tILA-A, -B, -C, and -DR typed healthy panel
donors and from healthy family members. From each donor, 3-5 ml heparin blood was drawn,
diluted with an equal amount of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and after layering over a
Ficoll-Isopaque (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Div. of Pharmaeia, Inc., Piscataway, N. J.) (7)
gradient (density, 1.077), the tubes were centrifuged for 15 min at 1,000 g. The cells in the
interface were, after washing with PBS-1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) used in the two-color
fluorescence (TCF) method as described by van Rood et al. (8) with a few modifications. As a
screening method, we used a microtest in HAMAX plates (Moss, Norway). Because only part
of the cells reacted, the results could only be evaluated by counting the percentage of the cells
that had been lysed. For that reason a macro TCF method was used.
Macro TCF Test. The test was performed as follows: two drops (:t: 0.05 ml) of antiserum
were incubated with 1 or 2 million mononuclear cells. These cells were labeled (in a volume of
0.5 ml) for 5 min at 37°C with FITC-labeled anti-Ig (Behring-Werke AG, Marburg/Lahn,
West Germany) diluted 1:3 with PBS in a silieonized test tube (8 × 0.8 cm) for 60 min at
20°C. After this incubation time, 10 drops of rabbit complement were added, the suspension
carefully mixed with a Pasteur capillary pipette, and incubated again for 2 h at 20°C.
Finally, two drops of ethidium bromide, 1:70 dilution in 5% EDTA in PBS of a concentrated
solution (100 p,g/ml) were added, gently mixed with a Pasteur pipette, incubated for 15 rain at
room temperature and the tube was centrifuged for 5 min at 600 g. The supernate was removed
and the sediment was transferred to a slide and covered with a coverglass. With a normal
microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, West Germany) with a two-wavelength illuminator after
Ploem (9), and 500 × magnification 200 to 300 cells were evaluated.
As a control, AB serum from a nontransfused, healthy male donor was used. In a TCF
preparation, one can identify T cells (not labeled by the anti-Ig-FITC; these cells can thus only
be seen with phase contrast) and monocytes (small green spots on the membrane; these cells do
not cap under the conditions described above), and B cells (green caps, and occasional
interrupted green lines). When a cell is dead the ethidium bromide stains the nucleus with a
red fluorescence. The green and red fluorescence can be seen simultaneously by appropriate use
of filters (8).
National Institutes of Health (NIH) Cytotoxicity Method. We used the normal standard NIH
method as described in the manual of tissue-typing techniques (10). The method used was,
briefly: serum and cells were incubated for 30 rain at room temperature in a micro-culture
tissue plate (catalog No. 1/5682; C. A. Greiner und Sfhn, West Germany) under paraffin oil.
Then normal rabbit complement was added and the mixture was incubated for another 60 rain
at room temperature. The reading was done with an inverted phase-contrast microscope after
the addition of eosin and after formalin fixation.
Serum Absorptions. Frozen mononuclear cells obtained from several (five-six) donors as
described above and pooled, were used for absorption of serum R. 40 million cells were used to
absorb 0.1 ml serum. All absorptions were done at room temperature. The lymphocytes were
divided into aliquots and spun for 10 rain at 20,000 g. The serum was added to the dry sediment
in the first tube, mixed well, incubated for 30 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant serum
was aspirated and added to the second tube with lymphocytes, mixed again, incubated for 30
min, and centrifuged. The absorbed serum was stored at -20°C until further use.
Indirect Immunofluorescence. One drop (+ 0.025 ml) serum and one drop mononuclear cells
containing 0.5-1 million cells were incubated in a silieonized glass tube (8 × 0.8 cm) for 30
min at 20°C. The sediment was washed three times with PBS-I% BSA, and then incubated
with one drop of the F(ab')2 preparation of a tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled
goat anti-human IgG (Fc), or one drop of the F(ab')2 preparation ofa FITC-labeled goat anti-
human anti IgM (Fc), or one drop of FITC-labeled goat anti-human anti IgA (Fc) (Nordic,
Tilburg, The Netherlands).
Marking of Monocytes with Latex. 5 ml heparin blood was shaken for 30 min in a 37°C
waterbath with 0.05 ml latex suspension (1-4 × 10x°particles per ml, DIFCO-BACTOLATEX
A. VANLEEUWEN, E. GOULMY, AND J. J. VANROOD 1077
0.81, Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.). Then the blood was diluted with an equal volume of
PBS and layered on Ficoll-Isopaque. Subsequently the tubes were spun for 15 min at 1,200 g.
The cells from the interface were washed twice with PBS-I% BSA and then incubated for 5
min at 37°C with FITC-labeled anti-Ig (Behring-Werke AG), diluted 1:3 with PBS.
Serum Fractionation. 5 ml of serum R. was fractionated on a Sephadex G-200 column
(Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Div. of Pharmacia, Inc.; 2.5 X 90 era) and eluted with PBS.
Fractions of 99 drops were collected and the IgM-, IgG-, and albumin-rich fractions were
pooled. These pools were desalted on a Sephadex G-25 coarse column (2.5 X 45 era) in 0.1 M
NH4HCOa. The protein-rich void-volume fractions were pooled and lyophilized. For testing in
the serological assays, the lyophilized pools were dissolved in 1 ml PBS. Particulate matter was
removed by centrifugation at 5,000 g for 20 min. The three fractions were also subjected to
immuno-eleetrophoresis to detect contaminations in the fractions with other Ig.
Results
First, we established whether the cells which were killed by serum R. were T cells,
B cells, and/or monocytes. From Table I it appears that only a part of the mononuclear
cells labeled with anti-Ig was reacting with the antibody. The monocytes were
differentiated from the B cells by treatment of the blood with latex. Because serum R.
did not react with latex-phagocytosing cells, it was concluded that it reacted with the
B cells only.
Next, the mononuclear cells of unrelated individuals was reacted with serum R. 14
cells showed a kill which was 19% or higher of the Ig-labeled mononuclear cells and
16 cells (including the patients' own cells) showed a kill of 6% or lower. Of two donors,
one of which was Mrs. R.'s mother, 13% of the Ig-labeled cells were killed. It was
decided that if 10% or less of the cells were killed, the reaction would be scored as
negative and that if 15% or more were killed, the reaction would be scored as positive.
A percentage kill of 10-15% would be considered as doubtful or unclassifiable.
To determine the optimal temperature for the reaction in the TCF method, serum
R. was titrated in normal AB serum and tested at 10°C, 20°C, and 37°C. At 10°C,
only weak antibody activity was demonstrated. Incubation at 37°C resulted in a
lower titer than incubation at 20°C. Moreover at 37°C a high background of dead T
cells and monocytes was found. On the basis of these findings all tests were done at
20°C. Serum R. did not contain an autologous antibody as was demonstrated by
testing the serum with Mrs. R.'s own cells.
From serum R. IgM-, IgG-, and albumin-rich fractions were prepared. Table II
shows the results of the reactions with HLA-A2-positive male and HLA-A2-positive
female cells with the IgM, IgG, and albumin serum fractions. It is apparent that the
activity was found in the IgM fraction. This fraction was not completely free of IgG,
but because the IgG fraction did not react with HLA-A2-positive male cells, we must
conclude that the antibody activity is located in the IgM fraction of the serum.
Moreover, we could prove with the indirect immunofluorescence method using F(ab')~
fragments of anti-IgM, anti-IgG, and anti-IgA that the HLA-A2-positive male cells
only react with anti-IgM and not with anti-IgG or anti-IgA.
Several sera samples were obtained from patient R. over a period of >1 yr.
Antibody activity was found in the anti-IgM fraction only (Fig. 1), and declined after
~1 yr. The antibody was stable at -20°C for several years.
When the serum of Mrs. R. was tested in the macro TCF test against a panel of
unrelated individuals consisting of 14 HLA-A2-positive male donors, 7 HLA-A2-
negative male donors, 7 HLA-A2-positive female donors, and 4 HLA-A2-negative

female donors, all the results that typed for HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DR were obtained
as shown in Table III. The serological data are given in the right-hand column. This
column indicates the percentage of anti-Ig FITC-labeled cells that were killed.
An almost perfect correlation between the lysis induced by the lymphocytes of Mrs.
R. in the CML test and the complement-dependent lysis with the serum of the same
patient was observed.
All HLA-A2-positive male donors were positive, and all HLA-A2-negative male
donors were negative. From the HLA-A2-positive female donors, two gave a borderline
positive reaction (A. J. and M. S., both 13%). The last one is the mother of the patient.
The HLA-A2-negative female donors all gave negative reactions.
Comparison of the last two columns from this table show that there exists excellent
agreement between the results obtained with the CML method and those obtained
with the TCF method.
Table IV shows the results of the absorption with pools of different cell combina-
tions. Only HLA-A2-positive males were able to absorb the antibody from the serum.
The only exception was found when serum R. was absorbed with the lymphocytes of
the mother. After absorption, no antibody activity was demonstrated anymore in the
serum R. against an HLA-A2 male donor.
Discussion
The complement lymphocytotoxic activity found in serum R. is, in all probability,
a result of an antibody. This conclusion is based on the findings that it reacted with
part of the mononuclear cells, recognized a polymorphic determinant, was stable at
-20°C for several years, and could be absorbed by cells carrying the corresponding
specificities (A2-positive males), but not by other ceils from other donors. Lastly, the
antibody activity was shown to be in the IgM fraction, both on the basis of serum
fractionation and immunofluorescence studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first description of an MHC-restricted antibody.
That the reaction observed is antibody dependent appears thus to be well estab-
lished. Far less clear is the character of the antigen(s) with which the antibody reacts.
That the HLA-A2 antigens are involved seems to be certain. The problem lies in the
definition of the characterization of the other antigen. In the beginning it was thought

to be due to an extra antibody with another specificity. This assumption was
analogous to the one made by Goulmy et al. (5, 6) when they described the HLA-A2-
restricted, cell-mediated, anti-H-Y killing of the lymphoeytes of Mrs. R. Then also, a
few HLA-A2-positive female cells were found which were lysed by Mrs. R.'s lympho-

the existence of a weak extra antibody becomes, however, rather unlikely because at
least one of these female cells was able to absorb all antibody reactivity against the
male A2-positive cells from the serum. We could assume the presence of two poten-
tiating or complementing antibodies, one an anti,HLA-A2 and the other an anti-H-
Y. One would then have to postulate that, with a few exceptions, only when a cell
presents both the HLA-A2 and H-Y antigen will lysis occur. Occasionally, an HLA-
A2-positive female cell will be lysed by the anti-HLA-A2 alone. This explanation is,

in all probability, incorrect because we then expect that HLA-A2-negative males and
HLA-A2-positive females would be able to absorb the antibody, and this appears not
to be the case (Table IV).
Furthermore, Mrs. R. is HLA-A2 homozygous positive, which almost excludes the
possibility that she can make an anti-HLA-A2 antibody. A possibility which cannot
be ruled out is that the non-HLA antigen is not coded for by the H-Y chromosome,
but by an autosomal chromosome that is involved in either the development of
maleness or the expression of H-Y. This explanation is not very satisfying either
because it would imply that the two females, A. J. and M. S., would be, in this regard,
different from the other four HLA-A2-positive females and we have no evidence for
this.
It is clear that serum R. should not only be studied by cytotoxicity, but by other
techniques as well. We have started such a study with immunofluorescence. (Fig. 1).
More-sensitive techniques, including cell-surface-labeling techniques, will be nec-
essary to study not only the distribution of the antigen(s) involved, but the character
of the antigen as well. If we assume on the basis of the absorption experiments that
only one antibody is responsible, then logically the next question is whether this
antibody reacts with an antigen that arises through an interaction of HLA-A2 with
the non-HLA antigen (whether this is H-Y or something else is, in this context,
irrelevant) or whether the simultaneous presence of HLA-A2 and the non-HLA
antigen in the same cell induces a neo-antigen.
The striking similarity of the results in the CML test and the complement-
dependent cytotoxicity test shown in Table III raises the question, which cannot yet
be answered: What is the relation of the antigen recognized by the antibody vis-a-vis
the determinant interacting with the cytolytic cell?
The apparent contradiction of the good correlation between the serological detec-
tion of a polymorphic antigen present on part of the B cells and the killing in the
CML test of phytohemagglutinin blasts which are thought to arise predominantly
from T cells becomes understandable in the light of our finding that the antigen can
be shown to be present on T cells by immunofluorescence (A. van Leeuwen and J. J.
van Rood. Manuscript in preparation.).
It should be of interest to look for H-Y antibodies in the sera of other patients
whose lymphocytes show an HLA-restricted, anti-H-Y CML killing and for that
1082 MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX-RESTRICTED ANTIBODY
matter in the sera of all patients whose lymphocytes show a direct positive CML test.
One could even speculate that (some) CML reactions are a result of similar antibodies
and are thus in fact not cytotoxic T lymphocytes but antibody-dependent cell-
mediated cytotoxicity reactions. This seems, however, unlikely because the CML
reactions are done with three-times-washed lymphocytes in the absence of serum from
patients. Furthermore, ,absorptions on monolayers demonstrated the clonality of
cytotoxic T lymphocytes with MHC-restricted, anti-H-Y specificity (13). It is, in this
context, appropriate to emphasize that we would have missed the antibody in the
serum of Mrs. R. if we had not used the TCF test that enabled us to detect that a
small part of the mononuclear cells from peripheral blood were killed.
Preliminary results with cells from patients with abnormal chromosome patterns
have provided already interesting information on sexual differentiation. It might well
be that this serum and other similar ones might open new avenues in immunogenetics
and might be essential in the unraveling of the altered-self versus dual-recognition
dilemma by immunological methods.
Summary
An IgM antibody, present in the serum of a female patient with aplastic anemia,
is described that reacted in a modified complement-dependent cytotoxicity test with
a subset of the B cells from HLA-A2-positive, but not HLA-A2-negative males. With
the exception of two HLA-A2-positive females, the antibody did not react with other
cells from either HLA-A2-positive or HLA-2-negative females. The cells of one of
these and from HLA-A2-positive males were able to absorb the antibody from the
serum. Cells from other donors were unable to absorb the antibodies.
The mononuclear cells of the same patient were cytolytic in cell-mediated lym-
pholysis (CML) for phytohemagglutinin blasts from all HLA-A2-positive males and
one of the females reacting with antibody, but not with blasts from HLA-A2-negative
males and all other females. Thus, the results obtained with the antibody in the
complement-dependent cytotoxicity test showed an almost perfect correlation with
cytolysis in CML tests.
These results suggest that the IgM antibody may be the first example with major
histocompatibility complex restriction. Because the antibody reacted with the cells
from two female donors, the restricting determinant is not, in all probability, the H-
Y determinant.
