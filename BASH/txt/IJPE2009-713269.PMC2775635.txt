Objectives. To determine if the low iron state described in obese children is associated with the chronic inﬂammatory state seen in
obesity. Study Design. Obese children age from 2 to 19 years seen at a weight management clinic were studied prospectively. Data
were collected on age, gender, BMI, BMI z-score, serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, high
sensitivity creactive protein (hs-crp), and hemoglobin concentration. Results. 107 subjects were studied. Hs-crp levels correlated
positively with BMI (P < .001) and BMI z-score (P = .005) and negatively with serum iron (P = .002). 11.2% of subjects had
low serum iron. Median serum iron was signiﬁcantly lower for subjects with American Heart Association high risk hs-crp values
(>3 mg/L) compared to those with low risk hs-crp (<1 mg/L), (65 mcg/dL versus 96 mcg/dL, P = .016). After adjusting for age,
gender, and BMI z-score, serum iron was still negatively associated with hs-crp (P = .048). Conclusions. We conclude that the
chronic inﬂammation of obesity results in the low iron state previously reported in obese children, similar to what is seen in other
inﬂammatory diseases.

1. Introduction
Obesity is a substantial cause of morbidity among children.
Diseases such as hypertension, hyperinsulinemia, depres-
sion, sleep apnea, and type 2 diabetes mellitus are all
associated with pediatric obesity. It has been noted that obese
children have a higher incidence of low serum iron than
nonobese children [1–3]. Furthermore, data-based reviews
have shown obese children to have additional measures
of iron status such as ferritin, transferrin saturation, and
free erythrocyte protoporphyrin that are consistent with
iron deﬁciency at a high frequency [4, 5]. Obesity con-
tributes to an inﬂammatory state, with elevated markers
of inﬂammation such as high sensitivity c-reactive protein
(hs-crp) [6–9]. Obese children have higher values of hs-
crp than nonobese children, indicating that even very
early obesity is associated with inﬂammation [10]. Chronic
inﬂammation can lead to abnormal iron homeostasis by
decreasing intestinal absorption of iron and promoting its
sequestration into storage pools, such as macrophages of the
reticuloendothelial system, thereby lowering circulating iron
[11]. There thus exists a potential association between the
inﬂammation of obesity and the low iron state of obesity.
Such an association has been demonstrated in obese adults,
but not children [12].
We sought to determine prospectively if the low iron state
described with obesity is associated with the inﬂammation
seen in obese children and to assess associations of inﬂam-
matory markers with other markers of iron status and Body
Mass Index (BMI) in these children.
2. Patients and Methods
2.1. Patients. Over a 20-month period (10/15/2006 to 07/16/
2008), children age from 2 to 19 years old seen at Baystate
2 International Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology
Children’s Hospital Pediatric Weight Management Program
with obesity (BMI greater than 95% for age) were screened
with a questionnaire. Patients without an identiﬁed risk
for iron deﬁciency or a red cell disorder (heavy menstrual
periods, known bleeding from a gastrointestinal site, known
elevated levels of lead, thalassemia, sickle cell disease, sider-
oblastic anemia, aplastic anemia, vegan diet) or a disorder
associated with inﬂammation (inﬂammatory bowel disease,
autoimmune disease, cancer treated within the last year)
and those not taking iron supplements were eligible. Data
on age, gender, BMI, and BMI z-score were collected using
the Pediatric Endocrinology Dynamic Record Organizer
((PEDRO), a commercial software program that utilizes the
year 2000 growth charts). Subjects had blood samples drawn
for complete blood count, serum iron, ferritin, transferrin
saturation (serum iron/total iron binding capacity), free
erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP), and hs-crp.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Baystate Medical Center. All subjects signed written
informed consent or had parental consent with, if appropri-
ate for developmental level, child assent.
2.2. Assessment of Iron Status, Anemia, and Inﬂammation.
Iron status was assessed by serum iron (Roche Diagnostics
Modular P analyzer), ferritin (Roche Diagnostics E170 ana-
lyzer), transferrin saturation (Roche Diagnostics Modular P
analyzer), and FEP (Lab Corp of America). Low iron was
deﬁned as serum iron less than 45 mcg/dL. This value was
chosen because it was below the lower 5th percentile for
all age groups represented in the study and, for consistency
across studies, it had been used previously [2, 13]. Iron
deﬁciency was deﬁned with the combination of ferritin,
transferrin saturation, and FEP; if 2 of the 3 labs were
abnormal for age, a subject was classiﬁed as iron deﬁcient.
These criteria have been used in the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III and in the
previous studies on pediatric obesity and iron deﬁciency
[4, 14] (Table 1a).
Hemoglobin concentration was measured (Sysmex XE-
2100) to assess for anemia, with cutoﬀ values based on the
5th percentile for a reference group [14] (Table 1b).
High sensitivity crp (Roche Diagnostics Modular P
analyzer) was used as a marker of inﬂammation. Hs-crp
values were classiﬁed by American Heart Association (AHA)
standards for risk for cardiovascular disease: Low (<1 mg/L),
Intermediate (1–3 mg/L), or High (>3 mg/L).
2.3. Statistical Analysis. The distributions of all variables
were examined. Those that were approximately normally
distributed are reported with means and standard devia-
tions. Nonnormally distributed variables are reported with
medians and ranges. Since many variables did not meet
assumptions of normality, nonparametric statistics were
employed. Associations among variables which were at least
ordinally scaled were estimated using the Spearman rank
correlation. When comparing ordinal data across categorical
variables, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for cate-
gorical variables with two groups and the Kruskal-Wallis

test was used for categorical variables with three or more
groups. When a signiﬁcant global test was achieved using
the Kruskal-Wallis test, Bonferroni’s adjustment for multi-
ple comparisons was applied to the pairwise comparisons
of groups. Unconditional logistic regression was used to
determine the independent association between iron status
and hs-crp, adjusting for potential confounders. All analyses
were conducted using Stata (v.10.1, College Station, TX).
Associations were considered signiﬁcant at a critical level of
5%.
3. Results
3.1. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics (Table 2). 176
subjects were enrolled; 107 (60.8%) completed laboratory
testing adequate to assess iron status and inﬂammation.
There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in mean age, mean
BMI/BMI z-score, or gender distribution for subjects who
had laboratory studies drawn and those who did not.
3.2. Low Iron (Serum Iron <45 mcg/dL) (Table 3). 12 subjects
(11.2%) were classiﬁed as having low iron. Mean hs-crp was
higher in the low iron group than in the normal iron group,
although this did not reach signiﬁcance. Mean hemoglobin
was signiﬁcantly lower in the low iron group compared to

the normal iron group. All additional measures of iron status
were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between the two groups, with
ferritin and transferrin saturation lower and FEP higher in
the low iron group than in the normal iron group. There were
no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in BMI, BMI z-score, age, or gender
between the two groups.
3.3. Iron Deﬁciency and Anemia. 2 subjects (1.9%) met
NHANES criteria for iron deﬁciency. Neither subject had
anemia. 106 subjects had hemoglobin concentration mea-
sured. One subject (0.9%) had a hemoglobin concentration
that was low for age and gender; all iron studies in this subject
were above cutoﬀ values.
3.4. Hs-crp (Figure 1). 87 (81%) of subjects had hs-crp
levels classiﬁed as either AHA intermediate or high risk
for cardiovascular disease. The group of subjects with high
risk hs-crp had signiﬁcantly lower median serum iron than
those classiﬁed as low risk (65 mcg/dL, range 23–123 versus
96 mcg/dL, range 46–156, P = .016). Mean BMI was higher
in the high risk group compared to the low risk group
(36.4 kg/m2 ± 7.3 versus 32.1 kg/m2 ± 6.2, P = .008). There
were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in age, gender, or BMI z-score
among the three risk groups.

negatively with serum iron (r = −0.29, P = .002), transferrin
saturation (r = −0.21, P = .033), and hemoglobin (r =

4. Discussion
This prospective study establishes the association between
the inﬂammatory state, as identiﬁed by hs-crp, and the low
iron state described in pediatric obesity. It also shows that
the inﬂammation of obesity disturbs basic iron homeostasis
as early as childhood and adolescence. Identiﬁcation of the
probable cause of the iron deﬁciency reported in obese
children is especially important because this age group
is particularly susceptible to the negative eﬀects of iron
deﬁciency, as discussed later.
Previous reports have proposed diﬀerent mechanisms
to explain the high rate of iron deﬁciency among obese
children, including consumption of high calorie, iron-poor
diets, sedentary lifestyle resulting in decreased myoglobin
breakdown, and increased iron requirements for increased
red cell mass. Our data support that it is the inﬂammation of
obesity that negatively inﬂuences iron homeostasis. A similar
association has been described in adults [12]. Anty et al.
reported on obese adult women undergoing bariatric surgery
who, when their BMI decreased postoperatively, showed a
decrease in levels of crp with an associated improvement in
markers of iron status, further suggesting that it is obesity
that leads to inﬂammation which in turn contributes to
abnormal measures of iron homeostasis [15].
It is known that obesity is associated with chronic
low levels of inﬂammation [16]. Adipose tissue secretes
a variety of proinﬂammatory cytokines including tumor
necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 [16, 17]. The positive
association of hs-crp with ferritin and negative associations
with serum iron, transferrin saturation and hemoglobin,
as shown in this study, are characteristic of inﬂammation’s
eﬀects on measurements of iron homeostasis. A potential
mechanism explaining the impact of obesity on iron sta-
tus may involve the increased production of the protein

hepcidin. Hepcidin is a key regulator of iron homeostasis,
decreasing intestinal iron absorption and promoting iron
sequestration in macrophages, eﬀectively lowering serum
iron and the bioavailability of iron. Hepcidin is produced
primarily in the liver but is expressed in adipose tissue as
well [18]. Its expression is increased by interleukin-6, which
is higher in obese than nonobese children. In addition, there
are data to suggest that hepcidin expression is increased by
the adipose-derived hormone leptin [19].
In an attempt to isolate obesity’s inﬂuence on iron status,
subjects at risk for iron deﬁciency were excluded. Because
of this, iron deﬁciency, as deﬁned by NHANES criteria, in
this screened population, was not as prevalent as in reviews
of unscreened obese children [4]. When our rate of iron
deﬁciency (1.9%) is added to the rate reported for nonobese
children (2.1%), one gets a rate of iron deﬁciency closer to
the 5.5% described for obese children [4]. Thus, the reported
increase in iron deﬁciency among obese children may be
attributable to the inﬂammation of obesity and its eﬀects on
measures of iron status.
Potential complications of iron deﬁciency during child-
hood and adolescence include poorer cognition, worse
school achievement, and more behavior problems than in
children without iron deﬁciency [20–22]. Cournot et al. in
a prospective study found an association between higher
BMI and lower cognitive scores in middle aged men and
women, but iron status was not assessed [23]. We are
unaware of such descriptions in children but future research
could investigate associations between BMI, iron status, and
cognitive function.
In addition to its impact on iron homeostasis, inﬂam-
mation is associated with the development of cardiovascular
disease in adults. This study conﬁrms elevated levels of hs-
crp in obese children as well as the positive association
between hs-crp and BMI/BMI z-score [24, 25]. That is,
the more obese a child is, the more systemic inﬂammation
they are exposed to. The majority of the children in this
study were signiﬁcantly obese, with a mean BMI z-score of
2.5 and had levels of hs-crp at intermediate or high risk
for cardiovascular disease according to adult studies [26].
The full eﬀects of years of such inﬂammation on children’s
cardiovascular health have yet to be determined. Baker et al.
showed that an elevated BMI in childhood was associated
with signiﬁcantly increased risk of both fatal and nonfatal
coronary heart disease later in life [27].
A potential limit of this study is that although at the
time of enrollment subjects were screened for risks of
inﬂammation, some subjects had blood drawn days or weeks
later and could have been ill at the time of phlebotomy thus
raising hs-crp levels above baseline. While possibly impacting
lab variables such as hs-crp, ferritin, or iron, such a situation
would not account for the positive association of hs-crp and
BMI/BMI z-score. Although we demonstrated correlations
between BMI/BMI z-score and hs-crp as well as between
hs-crp and measurements of iron status, without nonobese
subjects, it is diﬃcult to assess the degree of eﬀect weight
status has on hs-crp and iron status.
These data raise several questions for future childhood
obesity research. It has been demonstrated that weight loss
is associated with reduction in crp [15, 28]. Does weight loss
improve iron status in children as it has been suggested to do
in some adults [15]? Is oral iron supplementation suﬃcient
to correct low serum iron? Do anti-inﬂammatory medicines
alter iron status in obese children? Does the low iron state of
obesity contribute to poor neurocognitive function? Does the
inﬂammation of obesity alter metabolism of other essential
trace elements, such as zinc, copper, and selenium? Future
research may address some of these questions.
This study provides the probable link between two
long-known important aspects of pediatric obesity—chronic
inﬂammation and abnormal, low iron status. It illustrates
the pervasive nature that obesity has on children and their
health, aﬀecting even essential mineral metabolism, and
shows that such eﬀects start early in the disease, during
International Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology 5
childhood. Such data could ultimately be used to support
evidence-driven public health policy and prevention of the
disease.
