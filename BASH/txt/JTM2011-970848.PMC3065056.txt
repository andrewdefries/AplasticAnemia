Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is responsible for a broad range of infections.
We report the case of a 46-year-old gentleman with a history of untreated, uncomplicated Hepatitis C who presented
with a 2-month history of back pain and was found to have abscesses in his psoas and right paraspinal muscles with
subsequent lumbar spine osteomyelitis. Despite drainage and appropriate antibiotic management the patient’s clinical condition
deteriorated and he developed new upper extremity weakness and sensory deﬁcits on physical exam. Repeat imaging showed
new, severe compression of the spinal cord and cauda equina from C1 to the sacrum by a spinal epidural abscess. After
surgical intervention and continued medical therapy, the patient recovered completely. This case illustrates a case of CA-MRSA
pyomyositis that progressed to lumbar osteomyelitis and a spinal epidural abscess extending the entire length of the spinal
canal.
1. Introduction
The diﬀerential diagnosis of fever and back pain in
an intravenous drug abuser is broad. Pyomyositis is an
intramuscular abscess of the large skeletal muscle groups
with most initial cases in the tropics but with increasing
worldwide distribution in nontropical areas as well. It is
often not diagnosed until the later stages of infection [1].
Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, laboratory,
and radiologic ﬁndings [1, 2]. Once treatment is begun,
outcome generally correlates with the extent of disease. We
present a case of primary pyomyositis with osteomyelitis
that, despite appropriate antibiotics and drainage, progressed
and extended into the epidural space, compressing the entire
spinal column. The objectives of this paper are to: (1) present
a case of progressive pyomyositis and (2) review the diagnosis
and treatment of an infection that has been increasing in
incidence in tropical and temperate climates.
2. Case
A 46-year-old gentleman presented to the hospital complain-
ing of right paraspinal back pain of 2-month duration with
increasing intensity. In the days prior to admission, he had
also noticed fevers, decreased appetite and overall malaise.
The patient had a medical history of uncomplicated,
untreated genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) and dyspepsia.
Surgical history was unremarkable. He was not taking any
medications. He lived at home with his mother. His last
reported IV drug use was two months prior. He continued to
smoke a pack of cigarettes a day and denied alcohol use. He
was heterosexual and denied unsafe sexual practices. There
was no recent travel and no history of trauma. He reported
an allergic reaction to penicillin.
Initial physical examination revealed a temperature of
102.2 degrees Farenheit, a heart rate of 137 beats per minute,
a blood pressure of 109/71 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of

Figure 1: Saggittal thoracolumbar spine MRI with STIR (short T1/tau inversion recovery): day 1 (a) and day 11 (b). Serial MRI images of
the thoracic and sacral spinal cord from hospitalization day 1 (a) and day 11 (b) using STIR (short T1/tau inversion recovery) sequences.
Panel A shows a 12 × 3 cm multiloculated abscess of the right paraspinal musculature in the L2–L5 region, and subtle enhancement of the
L3-L4 transverse processes, consistent with osteomyelitis. There is no epidural abscess. The MRI in (b) shows extensive rim enhancement of

16 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 97% on
room air. The patient was in moderate distress and appeared
ill. His cardiovascular exam revealed a regular tachycardia,
without murmurs, rubs or gallops. His lungs were clear
and his abdominal exam was unremarkable. His back exam
revealed spinal tenderness from L2 through L4 without
ﬂuctuance or costovertebral angle tenderness. His extremity
exam was signiﬁcant for a right-sided psoas sign, otherwise,
strength and range of motion was intact. Neurologically there
were no cranial nerves deﬁcits, reﬂexes were symmetrical and
normal, and distal sensation was intact. Dermatologic exam
was unremarkable.
Laboratory data revealed a white blood cell count of
11.2 × 103
cells/mm, a hemoglobin of 11.2 gm/dL, and
platelets of 220 × 109
/L. Sodium was 131 mEq/L and the
remainder of his chemistry panel, coagulation studies and
liver function tests were normal. There was no anion gap.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 80 mm/hr. An initial
chest X-ray was normal. Blood and urine cultures were
drawn and the patient was started on vancomycin. A mag-
netic resonance image (MRI) with gadolinium contrast of
the lumbar and thoracic spine done on the day of admission
revealed a large multiloculated abscess measuring 12 cm
craniocaudally by 3 cm axially within the right posterior
paraspinal musculature from L2 through L5, with subtle
enhancement of the L3 and L4 right transverse processes
consistent with osteomyelitis. There was dural enhancement
at L3 and L4 but no epidural abscess (Figure 1(a)), and
his cervical spine was unremarkable (Figure 2(a)). A pigtail
catheter drain was inserted into the paraspinal abscess on
hospital day 2. Blood and abscess cultures grew methicillin-
resistant Stapyolococcus aureus (MRSA) sensitive to van-
comycin with a minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]
of ≤0.5 μg/mL.
The patient improved clinically by hospital day 5. White
blood cell count, which initially had increased, trended
down to normal. His catheter was not draining any ﬂuid.
The peak vancomycin level measured on day three was
32 mcg/mL, with a trough of 12 mcg/mL. A transesophageal
echocardiogram ordered on admission for initial concern
for endocarditis revealed a small ﬁlamentous echodensity
in the right anterior mitral valve leaﬂet consistent with
a small ruptured chordae without evidence of vegetations
of valvular regurgitation. A human immunodeﬁciency virus
(HIV) antibody test was negative. His HCV viral load
was 1.32 × 106
, with a normal alpha-fetoprotein level and
an ultrasound consistent with cirrhosis but without focal
masses. Surveillance cultures remained with no growth. The
patient inadvertently removed the pigtail catheter 4 days after
insertion, on hospital day 6. He remained afebrile.
On hospital day 11, the patient complained of new onset
tingling in his ﬁngertips bilaterally with upper extremity
weakness and minimal discomfort of his shoulders and chest
muscles. Exam at this time showed no meningismus, normal
cranial nerve function and reﬂexes. Strength was decreased
bilaterally and symmetrically on shoulder abduction (2/5),
elbow ﬂexion and extension (4/5), abductor pollicis brevis
function (3/5), ﬁnger abduction (4/5) and ﬁnger extension
(3/5). There was continued, decreased right paraspinal
tenderness but an improved psoas sign, with no new ﬁndings

otherwise. A repeat MRI performed at this time revealed an
extensive rim-enhancing epidural collection posterior to the
spinal cord and cauda equina that extended from the level of
the ﬁrst cervical vertebra to the sacrum, with continuous and
severe cord compression against the anterior spinal column
(Figures 1(b) and 2(b)) consistent with a large spinal epidural
abscess.
The patient was emergently taken to the operating
room on day 11 for decompression and epidural abscess
debridement. Cultures taken from the epidural abscess
intraoperatively grew MRSA, and the MIC to vancomycin
remained <0.5 ug/mL in this culture, which excluded both
a vancomycin intermediate resistant organism (where the
deﬁned MIC is between 4–8 ug/mL) and a fully vancomycin
resistant organism (where the MIC is ≥16 ug/mL). He had
no neurological impairment and was discharged on hospital
day 18 to a short-term rehabilitation center for physical and
occupational therapy and a six-week course of intravenous
vancomycin, chosen based on microbiological culture data,
where he recovered without sequelae.
3. Discussion
Pyomyositis is a suppurative infection of the large skele-
tal muscles without an apparent spread from contiguous
structures. Initially reported largely in the tropics, it has
become a disease of worldwide occurrence, with many cases
reported in temperate climates [1]. Thought to be due to
seeding of a muscle from transient bacteremia, the exact
pathophysiology is unknown, as only 5% to 37% of patients
with pyomyositis are bacteremic [1]. Staphylococcus aureus is
responsible for greater than 70% of infections [2], though
multiple other organisms have been reported [3]. Cases of
MRSA pyomyositis have been increasing reported to date [4].
Comorbid conditions may contribute to the pathogenesis
of pyomyositis, with approximately half of infected patients
having diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, aplastic anemia, sickle
cell disease, rheumatologic disease, malignancy, a history of
intravenous drug use or being immunosuppressed either by
the use of a medication or by HIV [5, 6].
The most commonly involved muscles are those in the
thigh and gluteal region, though infection of the deltoid,
psoas, biceps, gastrocnemius, and paraspinal region have also
been reported [6]. Classically, pyomyositis is described as
occurring in three stages [1]. Stage 1 manifests as crampy
muscle pain and low grade fever. There is often no sign
of underlying muscle or soft tissue swelling or infection.
Patients often do not present at this stage due to the vague
nature of the complaints. If they are seen by a physician,
the condition is often misdiagnosed. Stage 2 begins two to
three weeks after the initial onset of symptoms and includes
worsening muscle pain, swelling, erythema and fever.
A localized purulent collection has developed by this stage,
and patients often seek medical attention. If patients are
not treated in this stage, they progress to stage 3, which
include sepsis and clinical signs of toxicity. Diagnosis involves
recognition of the appropriate signs and symptoms as well as
a high index of suspicion.
Adjunctive laboratory testing is often not helpful, with
variations in the white blood cell count, C-reactive protein
and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate being dependent
on underlying diseases, especially, HIV, and often being
nonspeciﬁc [7]. Despite obvious muscle destruction, serum
creatine kinase and aldolase are often normal [8]. Blood

cultures are positive only in a minority of patients. MRI
with gadolinium contrast is the preferred diagnostic test,
if available, showing low signal intensity on T1 weighted
images and high signal intensity with diﬀuse borders and
contrast enhancement of T2 weighted images [9]. It is often
diﬃcult to diagnose without MRI given the vague and
subacute presentation. While other imaging modalities have
been used in resource-poor settings, MRI with gadolinium
contrast is the gold-standard imaging test especially in
cases of infections that aﬀect more than the extremities,
as it can provide a more speciﬁc diagnosis if there are
multiple infections simultaneously (i.e., pyomyositis and
osteomyelitis, as in this case) [10].
Treatment of pyomyositis is dependent on the stage of
the infection at diagnosis [1]. Stage 1 can be treated with
oral antibiotics. More advanced stages require intravenous
antibiotics with initial broad coverage for all potential
pathogens, keeping in mind that patients with underlying
medical comorbidities have a higher risk of gram-negative
infections. Often times, interventional radiology or surgical
intervention is necessary to drain abscesses and ﬂuid collec-
tions. Complications of pyomyositis include muscle scarring,
residual weakness, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, pericarditis
and septic shock, among others [1]. With appropriate
therapy, patients usually recover well without sequelae.
What is unique to the present case is that the patient’s
infection progressed despite appropriate antibiotic ther-
apy and drainage. It also highlights the close anatomical
relationship of the involved progressive infection: the ini-
tial pyomyositis of the paraspinal muscle, which lies just
posterior to the lumbar transverse processes, and psoas
muscle, which abuts the lateral portion of the vertebral
body, had eroded into the lumbar vertebrae and eventually
extended into the spinal canal. Despite the dramatic clinical
deterioration of our patient, he made a complete recovery
without any permanent neurological deﬁcits.
