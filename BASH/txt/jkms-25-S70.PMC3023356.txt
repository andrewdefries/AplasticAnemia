Ionizing Radiation-induced Diseases in Korea
Radiation risk has become well known through epidemiological studies of clinically or
occupationally exposed populations, animal experiments, and in vitro studies; however, the
study of radiation related or induced disease has been limited in Korea. This study is to find
the level of occupational radiation exposure for various kinds of accidents, compensated
occupational diseases, related studies, and estimations on future occupational disease risks.
Research data of related institutions were additionally investigated. About 67% of 62,553
radiation workers had no exposure or less than 1.2 mSv per year. The 5 reported cases on
radiation accident patients in Korea occurred during nondestructive testing. According to
the recent rapid increase in the number of workers exposed to radiation, a higher social
recognition of cancer, and an increasing cancer mortality rate, it is expected that
occupational disease compensation will rapidly increase as well. Therefore, it is important to
develop scientific and objective decision methods, such as probability of causation and
screening dose in the establishment of an exposure and health surveillance system.

Occupation & Environmental Medicine
INTRODUCTION
Ionizing radiation (radiation) is defined as the energy required
to remove electrons from a molecule (1) and a radiation worker
is defined as one who is exposed or possibly exposed to radia-
tion due to work-related activities. As in most countries, radia-
tion is a unique toxic agent controlled by the Atomic Energy Act
(Atomic Act) and Medical Service Act (Medical Act), and man-
aged by the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act). Ra-
diation-induced disease can be divided into radiation injury
and cancer. The main cause of radiation injury is accidental
overexposure that is usually reported as a skin burn.
  In the latter part of the 1990s, claims for compensation of ra-
diation-related cancer have increased. In 2000, acute myelocyt-
ic leukemia from radiation exposure was formally approved as
an occupational disease (2) by the administrative courts. After
the radiation-related industry was established in Korea, the first
formal case of a radiation accident occurred at the Atomic En-
ergy Research Institute in 1961 (3). From 1961 to 1969, 32 acci-
dents were reported. Among them was a case of over-exposure
up to 1.3 Sv to the entire body due to mismanipulation at a Co-
balt-60 gamma irradiation facility.
  According to the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety (KINS), 27
cases of occupational radiation exposure accidents were report-
ed from1984to2005(4),withadditionalradiationinjuryreports
coming from related academic societies. Anxiety related to ra-
diation exposure have caused many controversies for related
industrial nuclear development and are a result of high profile
accidents, such as the 1986 Chernobyl accident in the Ukraine
and the anencephaly case of an inhabitant in Korea near the
Yonggwang Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) in 1989. An epidemio-
logical study on the NPP and nearby residents was commenced
because of the anencephaly case; in addition, a follow-up study
on cancer incidence and mortality is ongoing in the area. Re-
cently, a lawsuit regarding occupation-related syndactyly was
decided, with the court ruling there was no causal relationship
(2008gahap6865); however, this illustrates that radiation anxi-
ety is still a current social issue.
  To investigate radiation-induced disease in Korea, we first
analyzed the level of occupational radiation exposure, searched
for various kinds of cases for related accidents and occupational
diseases,andthenestimatedrelatedandfutureresearch.Itshould
be noted that the Ministry of Education Science and Technolo-
gy (MEST), Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA), and
the Ministry of Employment and Labor (MOEL) manage Kore-
an radiation workers separately; therefore, it is necessary to un-
derstand the current system and recommend future changes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The search for articles related to Korea were restricted to Eng-
lish-language publications published by December 31, 2009,

and was carried out using Medical Subject Heading search
terms(Keywords:radiation, protection,occupationalexposure,
nuclear power plant, Korea, Korean) of MEDLINE, a search en-
gine of the National Library of Medicine.
  In Korea, searches were conducted using the Research Infor-
mation Service System, National Digital Science Links (Key
words: radiation, accident, disease). Other sources for publica-
tions included individual journals such as the Journal of Korean
NuclearSociety,JournalofKoreanAssociationofRadiationPro-
tection, Korean Journal of Dermatology, Korean Journal of Oc-
cupational and Environmental Medicine, and Journal of Pre-
ventive Medicine and Public Health; the references cited in the
text of selected papers were also searched. In addition, to inves-
tigate the level of exposure and health management, research
materials from KINS, MOEL, and the Occupational Safety and
Health Research Institute (OSHRI) were analyzed. The workers’
number of compensation claims on occupational disease pre-
dicted using the method of Jeong et al. (5).
RESULTS
There were 62,554 occupational radiation workers in nuclear
power plants, medical fields, industry, and miscellaneous posi-
tions as of 2006. The occupational categories of these workers
were medical 53%, nuclear power plants 21.3%, and industry
17.5% (Table 1).
  There were 8 reported cases of health disorders due to radia-
tion accidents(exceptformedicalfields)inKorea.Thetotal sub-
jects to exposure were 15 males that had radiation burns that
occurred during non-destructive testing (Table 2).

  The radiation management systems are shown in Table 6.
Radiation-related acts consist of the OSH Act, Atomic Act, and
MedicalAct.EachActtargetsdifferentsubjects.TheMedical Act
covers health care workers exposed to radiation. The Atomic
Act is applied to all workers in atomic power plants and in non-
destructive testing industry. The OSH Act covers all workers ex-
posed to radiation, but does not require to keep the record of
exposure dose while the Atomic and Medical Acts do.
 
DISCUSSION
MEST and KFDA established databases on present occupation-
al exposure status. Lee (6) reported on established occupational
exposure levels and the unmanaged data of air-crews, as they
were not yet classified as radiation workers in Korea. Upon this,
KINS published a report on the radiation exposure level for the
Korean population (7). As nuclear and medical radiation work-
ers were legally required to wear a dosimeter and a dosimetry
record system was legally enacted, it was possible to acquire
dose information. For aircrews, even though exposure manage-
ment has not been undertaken, it was possible to use a cumula-
tive calculation program to analyze cosmic rays on some flight
routes. In this study, coal miners exposed to radon and diag-
nostic radiography technicians at animal hospitals were ex-
cluded (7).
  In2006,therewere62,554radiationworkers,and67%ofthese
people were shown to have no exposure or less than 1.2 mSv
per year, which was consistent with the general distribution of
radiation workers (8). The exposure limit in Korea must not cur-
rently exceed 100 mSv per 5 yr and 50 mSv per 1 yr. Workers re-
ceiving a dose of more than 20 mSv totaled approximately 0.3%
and showed that the exposure dose has been managed well (7).
However, according to Lee et al. (9) who compiled exposure re-
cords of KFDA from 1996 to 2006, the highest exposures (classi-

  Table 4 shows results of workers’ compensation claims on
occupational diseases. The first claim for occupational disease
of a nuclear power plant worker was acute myelocytic leukemia
in 1988; however, it was dismissed. In 2000, acute myelocytic
leukemia of a nuclear power plant worker who had performed
welding operations at the nuclear power plant was the first ap-
proved case.
  Of the predicted number of compensations for occupational
diseases in 2015, the approval possibility for leukemia (except
chronic lymphocytic leukemia) was the highest. The numbers
of approval possibility for leukemia were predicted to be 0.406,
0.472, and 0.622 at significance levels of 90%, 95%, and 99%, re-
spectively. The significance levels for colon cancer were 0.008,

fied by occupation) were for radiation technologists with an av-
erage annual effective dose of 1.83 mSv; the average of all occu-
pational workers was 0.94 mSv. The level of radiation exposure
has decreased every year and suggests that exposure manage-
ment has improved.
  In 1976, the only reported death by radiation exposure was
caused by a safety failure at the irradiation room of the Korea
Atomic Energy Research Institute (10). However, the most com-
mon injured parts of the body in radiation accidents were the
hands,oftenduetounrecognizedradiationexposureinthenon-
destructive testing industry (4).
  There were 5 reported cases of radiation exposure in Korea
that occurred during non-destructive testing, with 12 males ex-
periencing radiation burns (Table 2). The current status of pri-
mary radiation accident in Korea has been posted on the relat-
ed homepage of the KINS (rasis.kins.re.kr/) (Table 3).
  Radiation is classified as a confirmed carcinogen by the In-
ternational Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). It is known
that (except for mesothelioma and chronic lymphocytic leuke-
mia), radiation causes almost all kinds of cancers (1). Due to
the increase in number of radiation-related workers and the
higher social recognition of occupational disease (particularly
cancer), the claim for occupational disease compensation re-
lated to radiation exposure has been increasing. In 1998, a male
NPPworkermadeaclaimforcompensationduetooccupation-
related radiation exposure causing cancer. However, this case
was dismissed because there was no documented radiation ex-

After that, an NPP welder with acute myelocytic leukemia be-
came the first approved case, and it provided an opportunity to
study the availability of probability of causation (PoC) for a sci-
entific approach to occupational diseases (11). After the adop-
tion of a PoC assessment for occupational diseases, the occu-
pational disease review committee of the OHSRI has used it to
discuss the causal relationship between radiation exposure and
diseases. However, some unfavorable cases were later approved
by the administrative courts (4).
  Decision-making has become more important and the num-
ber of radiation workers and the necessity for radiation-induced
occupationaldiseasecompensationhasincreased.Thoughcan-
cer does not exhibit any special aspects related to radiation, an
objective statistical measurement, the PoC, has been defined
below to assess the contribution of radiation exposure to the
development of cancer in a radiation worker (12).
 
PoC=
RadRisk
×100%
BaseRisk+RadRisk
  BaseRisk refers to the baseline cancer risk of the general pop-
ulation, while RadRisk is the excess cancer risk due to radiation
exposure. Therefore, PoC measures the rate of the cancer risk
increased by radiation exposure to the total cancer risk of the
population exposed to radiation; when that value exceeds 50%
it was considered that the cancer was due to radiation exposure.
  In 1985 (13), the National Institute of Health used PoC to as-
sess the radiation causality of cancer in radiation workers, and
theNationalInstituteforOccupationalSafetyandHealth(NIOSH)
developed the NIOSH-Interactive RadioEpidemiological Pro-
gram (www.niosh-irep.com/irep_niosh) as a PoC calculation
program based on the National Cancer Institute-Centers for Dis-
ease Control model and has operated it until now (14), the US
Department of Energy (DOE) is currently judging a request for
radiation-induced occupational disease compensation raised
by the US DOE or nuclear weapons-related workers on the ba-
sis of the 99% upper confidence limit of PoC.
  In 1999, the Korea Radiation Risk and Assigned Share (KOR-
RAS) first developed a PoC calculation program for radiation
workers in Korea (15). KORRAS provided various modes of PoC
point estimates, and it was suggested to use the largest estimate
of PoC for a person who developed cancer. However, various
uncertainties existed in the PoC calculation. Therefore, the PoC
shouldbepresentedasadistributionorconfidenceintervalthat
better reflects these uncertainties, rather than a single point es-
timate. Currently, the Radiation Health Research Institute-Pro-
gramforEstimatingtheProbabilityofCausation(RHRI-PEPC)is
evaluating the radiation causality of cancer in Korean radiation
workers (11) that reflects background mortality, incidence, and
the smoking rate in Korea; in addition, the study is based on the
most recent NCI-CDC mode. RHRI-PEPC is also using a com-
puter program developed to calculate the distribution of PoC.
  It is expected that the number of radiation workers will in-
crease continuously, leading to increased cancer incidence and
mortality; as a result there is a possibility that claims for occu-
pational disease compensation will also increase. Therefore, the
social costs of occupational disease will need to be evaluated.
To solve this problem, it is necessary to introduce a screening
dose. The US Department of Veterans Affairs used a screening
dose that considered the uncertainty of PoC on the basis of a
calculation model that judged requests for radiation-induced
occupationaldiseasecompensationbyveterans(16).Thisscreen-
ing dosecanalsobeusedtoestimatethenumberofpersonswho
may possibly be approved for future occupational disease com-
pensation. Jeong et al. (5) proposed a screening dose through
the use of exposure data of MEST and estimating the numbers
of compensation cases for occupational disease. The numbers
of compensation cases that would be approved as occupational
disease for the next decade were predicted to be 3-5 workers,
4-6 workers, and 6-10 workers at the significance levels of 90%,
95%, 99%, respectively.

ed in1992tocomprehensivelyverifythehypothesisofthestudy:
‘Can the operation of NPP casually increase the incidence risk
in nearby residents and workers?’ (17). This study was conduct-
ed by Seoul National University and supported by MEST. The
cohort was included in the international collaborative study of
cancer risks among workers in the nuclear industry (8). The fol-
low-up on cancer incidence and mortality for NPP nearby resi-
dents (n=10,548) and the control group (n=23,041), and NPP
workers (n=8,552), and the control group (n=9,096) will be fin-
ished in 2011 (17). In contrast, the epidemiological study for all
Korea NPP workers was finished by the Radiation Health Re-
search Institute; the results did not show an increase in cancer
incidence or mortality according to radiation exposure dose
until now (2, 18, 19).

pensationledtoarecenthealthstatussurveyforradiationwork-
ers conductedbytheOHSRIinKorea(4).Thestudyshowedthat
the incidence of thyroid cancer in radiation workers may be
higher than other occupations through the use of MEST radia-
tion worker exposure data and National Health Insurance Cor-
poration admission data (20). However, it cannot exclude the
mass screening effects and further study will be needed.
  The KFDA manages medical radiation workers and estab-
lished a cohort study using exposure records (21). Lee et al. (9)
arranged exposure records by using the KFDA database from
1996to2006.Radiationtechnologistswereexposedtoarelative-
ly highradiationdoseandtheaverageannualeffectivedosewas

  Korean radiation workers are regulated by three acts, the
Jin Y-W, et al.  •  Ionizing Radiation-induced Diseases in Korea

Atomic Act, the Medical Act, and the OSH Act. However, there
were some mismatches or non-organized points for the expo-
sure measurement and health management. Recently, Kim (22)
made some suggestions following a health management survey
of radiation workers: 1) Radiation measurement is regulated by
theAtomicActandMedicalAct,sotheOSHActcanfollowthese
acts and 2) Health management of radiation workers, that in-
cludeshealthexaminationsandeducation,shouldbeorganized
by the Medical Act.
  The OSH Act needs to reestablish health management to the
notified user. At present, the OSH Act designates general man-
agement, including health education and a special health ex-
amination to the notified user. However, the Atomic Act has no
special regulation because the exposure level was very low (22).
Therefore,Kim(22)suggestedthattheAtomicActwouldbemore
applicable. There are currently no regulations for air-crews and
veterinary hospital radiation workers and the above criteria
should be applied to them. The occurrence of radiation and ac-
cidents will most likely decrease if a consistency can be main-
tained.
  Radiation-induced disease can be divided into radiation in-
jury and radiation-induced cancers; it is expected that these in-
juries will be reduced in the future. However, the cancer mor-
tality for 65 yr-old Korean men was 27.7% in 2008 (23) and is ex-
pected to remain the same in the future (24). This situation will
leadtoadrasticincreaseinclaimsforoccupationaldiseasecom-
pensation.Therefore,establishingascientificandobjectivejudg-
ing systemusingPoCandscreeningdosewouldsavesocialcosts
and better judge the work related occupational disease. In ad-
dition, the radiation-related acts that have not been consistent-
ly managed need to be rearranged and reestablished, with a re-
organization of the exposure assessment, record system, and
health surveillance system for all radiation workers.
