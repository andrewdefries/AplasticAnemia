Abstract
Introduction: Glycogen storage disease type Ib is an autosomal recessive transmitted disorder of glycogen metabolism caused
by mutations in the glucose-6-phosphate translocase gene on chromosome 11q23 and leads to disturbed glycogenolysis as well
as gluconeogenesis. Besides hepatomegaly, growth retardation, hypoglycemia, hyperlactatemia, hyperuricemia and
hyperlipidemia, patients suffer from neutropenia associated with functional defects predisposing for severe infections. In order
to attenuate these complications, long-term treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is common but this is
associated with an increased risk for acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes in patients with inherited bone
marrow failures such as severe congenital neutropenia. Onset of these myeloid malignancies is linked to cytogenetic aberrations
involving chromosome 7. In addition, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is known to stimulate proliferation of monosomy 7
cells in vitro. To our knowledge, we report for the first time a case report of a patient with glycogen storage disease type Ib,
who developed acute myeloid leukemia with a classical monosomy 7 and acute myeloid leukemia-associated translocation
t(3;8)(q26;q24) after 14 years of continuous treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.
Case presentation: A 28-year-old Turkish man with glycogen storage disease type Ib was admitted to our department because
of dyspnea and increasing fatigue. He also presented with gum bleeding, bone pain in his legs, night sweats, recurrent episodes
of fever with temperatures up to 39°C and hepatosplenomegaly.
A blood count taken on the day of admission showed pancytopenia and a differential count displayed 30% blasts. A bone marrow
biopsy was taken which showed a hypercellular marrow with dysplastic features of all three cell lines, while blast count was 20%.
Classical cytogenetic analyses as well as fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a monosomy 7 with a translocation
t(3;8)(q26;q24). Based on these findings, the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was made.
Conclusion: Our observations suggest that bone marrow examinations including cytogenetic analysis should be carried out on
a regular basis in patients with glycogen storage disease type Ib who are on long-term treatment with granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor for severe neutropenia, since this treatment might also contribute to an increased risk for acute myeloid
leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.

Introduction
Glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSD-Ib), one of over 12
inherited metabolic disorders of glycogen metabolism, is
an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the
glucose-6-phosphate translocase (G6PT) gene on chro-
mosome 11q23. As a result of the G6PT deficiency, gly-
cogenolysis as well as gluconeogenesis is disturbed.
Patients suffer from hepatomegaly, growth retardation,
hypoglycemia, hyperlactatemia, hyperuricemia and
hyperlipidemia. The disease is further characterized by
neutropenia associated with functional defects predispos-
ing for severe infections including perioral and perianal
ulcers as well as inflammatory bowel disease. In order to
attenuate these complications, long-term treatment with
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is com-
mon [1].
Case presentation
We report the case of a 28-year-old Turkish man with a
GSD-Ib who received treatment with G-CSF for 14 years
because of disease-associated neutropenia. He has now
developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with mono-
somy 7 and translocation t(3;8)(q26;q24). Admission to
our hospital was required because of dyspnea and increas-
ing fatigue. He also presented with gum bleeding, bone
pain in his legs, night sweats, and recurrent episodes of
fever with temperatures up to 39°C.
At the age of 1 year, a liver biopsy including enzyme func-
tion tests, which was performed because of hepatomegaly,
recurrent hypoglycemia, growth retardation and bacterial
infections of the upper respiratory system, confirmed the
diagnosis GSD-Ib. As accessible in 1999, a mutational
analysis of peripheral blood cells showed a homozygous
mutation of exon 8 of the G6PT-locus (GPTL c.1211 del
CT/c.1211 del CT) confirming this diagnosis. In the past,
he had experienced recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia
and hyperlactatemia associated with severe metabolic
decompensations often requiring hospitalization. In
order to prevent these metabolic disturbances, a special
diet consisting of regular, carbohydrate-rich meals every 2
hours and ingestion of uncooked cornstarch twice per
night was necessary. Because of relapsing oral and peri-
anal aphthous ulcers as a result of severe neutropenia and
neutrophilic dysfunction as indicated by a decreased
deoxyglucose uptake, he received either filgrastim or
lenograstim from the age of 15 years at different dose lev-
els. In detail, cumulative duration of G-CSF therapy was
12.84 years and time-averaged dose was 2.83 μg/kg/day,
leading to a total cumulative dose 13,729 μg/kg. An
increase in white blood cell (WBC) count from baseline
values of 3200/μl with a median of 14% neutrophils to a
WBC count of 4245/μl with a median of 38% neutrophils
could be achieved. The rise in neutrophil counts led to a
substantial reduction in infectious complications. Bone
marrow examinations were performed four times since
the beginning of G-CSF treatment. The last examination
was carried out at the age of 22 years showing no signs of
leukemic transformation.
The patient is retarded in growth with a size of 160 cm and
a body weight of 50 kg. The color of his skin is pale and
he has hardly any secondary body hair. We found a few
aphthous ulcers scattered in the oral cavity and mucosa
bleeding. As confirmed by abdominal sonography, the
patient had hepatosplenomegaly (liver 124 mm cranio-
caudal diameter × 148 mm dorsoventral diameter in
medioclavicular line, spleen length 138 mm × depth 57
mm). Blood count taken at the day of admission showed
pancytopenia with a WBC count of 2.000/μl, reduced
hemoglobin of 4.2 g/dl with normal erythrocyte indices
and a platelet count of 71 × 103/μl. Differential count was
as follows: 62% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, 4% mature
neutrophilic granulocytes and 30% blasts. A first bone
marrow biopsy was taken showing a hypercellular mar-
row with dysplastic features of all three cell lines, while
blast count was 20%. This result was confirmed by flow
cytometry analysis with 30% CD34 positive cells.
The patient received four units of packed erythrocytes,
which led to an increase in hemoglobin concentration to
10.1 g/dl. Empiric antimicrobial treatment was started
because of recurrent fever and rising serum levels of the C-
reactive protein. Despite X-ray examination of his thorax,
laboratory and microbial analysis of urine and feces and
daily physical examination, no source of infection could
be found. Since the serum level of procalcitonin as a pos-
sible marker for an infection was normal, we interpreted
the fever as disease-related. As a consequence of the dis-
continuation of G-CSF administration, the leukocyte
count declined to 800/μl, while the proportion of blasts in
the peripheral blood was 4%. The rest of the white blood
cells were lymphocytes without any mature neutrophils.
The platelet count decreased to 36.000/μl with an ongo-
ing need for red blood cell transfusions. A second bone
marrow biopsy was performed still showing an elevated
blast count of 21% with the same features of dysplasia
(Figure 1). Classical cytogenetic analyses showed a mono-
somy 7 in 33 of 34 analyzed metaphases with a transloca-
tion t(3;8)(q26;q24). Monosomy 7 as well as
translocation t(3;8)(q26;q24) was confirmed by fluores-
cence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 78.5% of the exam-
ined metaphases (Figure 2). Based on these findings, the
diagnosis of an acute myeloid leukemia with multilineage
dysplasia with a typical monosomy 7 and translocation
t(3;8)(q26;24) was made.
In the light of the increased risk profile of this patient due
to his metabolic disorder and the low response rate to
conventional chemotherapy of patients with chromo-

some 7 abnormalities, we administered a first course of
DNA methyl transferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine (151 mg
absolute subcutaneously daily for 5 days). This decision
was made because chromosome 7 alterations predict
response to treatment with this drug in patients with mye-
lodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or AML [2]. At the time of
writing this report, 100 days after the beginning of the first
course of the epigenetic therapy, the patient is still alive.
Transfusion-dependent pancytopenia persists, which is in
line with prior studies showing a response to 5-azacyti-
dine after 3 or 4 cycles [2]. Administration of a second
course of 5-azacytidine was avoided by infectious compli-
cations until now. Because patients with chromosome 7
abnormalities have a poor prognosis, the use of myeloab-
lative conditioning therapy allogeneic blood stem cell
transplantation with his Human Leukocyte Antigen
(HLA) identical twin sister is envisaged for the patient.
Discussion
As in our patient, neutropenia and neutrophilic dysfunc-
tion are characteristic findings in patients with GSD-Ib
leading to an increased risk of infectious diseases. Some of

the molecular mechanisms underlying the neutrophilic
dysfunctions in patients with GSD-Ib were unraveled by
Kim et al. [3]. For instance, neutrophil granulocytes
exhibit impaired respiratory burst as well as impaired
chemotaxis and calcium flux. The neutrophils also have
an increased preponderance for apoptosis which contrib-
utes to the development of neutropenia. The major reason
for these disturbances is the G6PT-defiency in the endo-
plasmic reticulum (ER) membrane of neutrophils result-
ing in a lack of glucose and increased oxidative stress [3].
The results of our genome-wide expression data on
CD34+ cells from bone marrow of normal donors (data
not shown) suggest that G6PT is normally expressed in
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. A G6PT-defi-
ciency in the CD34+ progenitor might therefore be of
functional relevance, in particular for the regular differen-
tiation along the myeloid pathway while erythropoiesis
and thrombopoiesis are not affected.
There are two case histories in the literature reporting on
patients with GSD-Ib who had developed AML. One of
them received G-CSF over a period of 6 years, while the
other did not receive the growth factor. Cytogenetic anal-
ysis in the patient being treated with G-CSF showed a nor-
mal 46 XX karyotype in 3 cells and a 47 XX +10 karyotype
in 1 cell [4,5]. Thus, considering the low incidence of
GSD-1b, neither an increased intrinsic risk for AML nor an
association between G-CSF treatment and evolution of
myeloid neoplasms has been noted so far [6].
With regard to neutropenia, we will place this case in the
context of other inherited bone marrow failures with iso-
lated neutropenias such as severe congenital neutropenia
(SCN) or Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS). These
diseases are associated with an enhanced risk for AML or
MDS [7]. In addition to this intrinsic risk, the likelihood
of developing myeloid neoplasms may also increase as a
result of long-term treatment with G-CSF as shown by the
data from the French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Study
Group and the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International
Registry [8,9]. Onset of AML or MDS in these patients is
linked to cytogenetic aberrations involving chromosome
7 in up to 76% of patients with SCN and 66% of patients
with SDS, respectively. Long-term treatment with G-CSF is
also associated with evolution of MDS in patients with
aplastic anemia involving monosomy 7 in up to 58% of
the patients [6,7]. In the light of these findings, it is inter-
esting to note that G-CSF is known to stimulate prolifera-
tion of monosomy 7 cells in vitro [10].
With regard to GSD-Ib, Donadieu et al. reported on a sur-
vey of 15 patients who were treated with G-CSF because of
disease-related neutropenia [8]. In this context, it is worth
noting that in our patient, the total cumulative duration
of G-CSF therapy (12.84 years) was much longer than in
the group reported by Donadieu et al. (median 2.8 years,
range 0.1 to 8.8 years) whereas the time-averaged dose
and total cumulative dose were comparable. Within this
group of patients, there was no case of AML and no obser-
vations with regard to clonogenic evolution or structural
or numeric aberrations of chromosome 7 [8].
Interestingly in our patient, at the age of 22 years, a cytoge-
netic analysis of bone marrow cells showed a monosomy
7 in 4.8% of the metaphases. This proportion was esti-
mated under cut-off and considered as pathologically
irrelevant. In the light of the actual finding with 78.5% of
the metaphases bearing the monosomy 7, we conclude
that the treatment with G-CSF might have contributed to
the gradual expansion of the monosomy 7 clone over
time. This view is supported by the finding of the translo-
cation t(3;8)(q26;24) which had not been found on the
occasion of the examination at the age of 22 years. This
reciprocal translocation is known to lead to an aberrant
expression of the proto-oncogene EVI1 and has been
implicated to be a pathophysically relevant aberration for
the development of an AML [11]. Thus, it might be postu-
lated that, during the expansion of the hematopoietic
stem cell clone bearing the monosomy 7 favored by con-
tinuous stimulation with G-CSF, the additional occur-
rence of the translocation t(3;8)(q26;24) was an
important step for leukemogenesis.
Conclusion
As a result of our observations, we suggest that bone mar-
row examinations including cytogenetic analysis should
be carried out on a regular basis in patients with GSD-Ib
who are on long-term treatment with G-CSF for severe
neutropenia, since G-CSF might also contribute to the
development of myeloid malignancies in these patients.
