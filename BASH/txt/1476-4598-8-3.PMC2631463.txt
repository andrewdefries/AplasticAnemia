Abstract
Cellular immortalization is a crucial step during the development of human cancer. Primary
mammalian cells reach replicative exhaustion after several passages in vitro, a process called
replicative senescence. During such a state of permanent growth arrest, senescent cells are
refractory to physiological proliferation stimuli: they have altered cell morphology and gene
expression patterns, although they remain viable with preserved metabolic activity. Interestingly,
senescent cells have also been detected in vivo in human tumors, particularly in benign lesions.
Senescence is a mechanism that limits cellular lifespan and constitutes a barrier against cellular
immortalization. During immortalization, cells acquire genetic alterations that override senescence.
Tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes are closely involved in senescence, as their knockdown
and ectopic expression confer immortality and senescence induction, respectively. By using high
throughput genetic screening to search for genes involved in senescence, several candidate
oncogenes and putative tumor suppressor genes have been recently isolated, including subtypes of
micro-RNAs. These findings offer new perspectives in the modulation of senescence and open new
approaches for cancer therapy.
Background
Primary mammalian cells reach proliferative exhaustion
after serial passage in culture, resulting in a permanent
and irreversible cell-cycle arrest [1]. This process, termed
replicative senescence, is characterized by a drastic pheno-
typic change in the cells, compared to their proliferating
counterparts [2]. The precise number of replicative dou-
blings exhibited by cultured cells before they reach senes-
cence depends on the species from which the cells are
derived, the tissue of origin, and the age of the donor
organism. Senescent cells are characterized by expression
of β-galactosidase, PAI-1 overexpression (plasminogen
activator protein 1) and altered cell morphology charac-
terized by giant cell size, increased cytoplasmic granularity
and a single large nucleus (Figure 1). Senescent cells,
arrested in G1 phase of the cell cycle, remain viable and
metabolically active and possess a characteristic transcrip-
tional prolife that distinguishes them from quiescent cells
[3]. In order to form tumors, incipient cancer cells must
breach this senescence barrier that normally limits their
proliferative potential.
Approximately one-fourth of people in the developed
world experience cancer during their life time. Cancer cells
display several hallmarks that can be distinguished from
those of normal counterparts. These include immortaliza-
tion or bypass of senescence, evasion of apoptosis and
anti-growth signals, growth factor independence,

enhanced glycolysis, anchorage-independence, resistance
to contact inhibition, angiogenesis, degradation of matrix
components, invasion, migration, etc. These properties
may provide good targets for anti-cancer drugs, such as
DNA damaging, anti-angiogenic, differentiation-induc-
ing, or apoptosis-inducing agents. It is likely that senes-
cent cells will ultimately be cleared by phagocytosis,
although it has not beeen clearly demonstrated for the
senescent state [4]. For example, senescent neutrophils
might face phagocytosis through an unknown mecha-
nism [5] and focal enrichment of lysosome-related β-
galactosidase activity at autodigestive vacuoles showed
that aged human fibroblast arrested in replicative senes-
cence might eliminate themselves by autophagy [6].
Interestingly, senescent cells have recently been detected
during tumorigenesis in mouse models and in human
tumors, particularly in benign lesions [7,8], and their
appearance is possibly relevant to tumor progression.
There are examples of in vivo senescent cells that may
reside for years in tissue, such as the senescent melano-
cytes of moles of nervi. Other senescent cells can be rap-
idly removed as tumors progress, for example in the case
of liver carcinomas [9,10].
The cellular senescence observed in tissue culture might
constitute a good model for understanding the signifi-
cance of senescence in vivo. Recent attempts at screening
cells for the ability to bypass senescence have identified
several putative novel oncogenes and tumor suppressor
genes. Genes whose ectopic expression results in replica-
tive senescence are considered potential oncogenes [11]
and are overexpressed in some types of cancer [12,13]. On
the other hand, genes whose inactivation results in cellu-
lar immortalization are potential tumor suppressor genes
[14,15] and are found to be downregulated in tumor-res-

escape from senescence.

ident tissues [16,17]. Therefore, senescence is considered
an anti-tumorigenic mechanism for avoiding indefinite
cell proliferation when a genetic alteration has occurred.
An important issue to consider in a senescence-based ther-
apy is the fact that the ultimate destiny of a senescence cell
is its terminal arrest (Figure 1). In this regard a metaboli-
cally arrested cell is not responsive to mitogenic signals
and it is quite unlikely that it resumes proliferation. If
senescent cells are able to reside for years in tissue, an epi-
genetic change could lead to escape from senescence.
Therefore future research should also focus on discovering
senescence markers that can be used for monitoring in vivo
the presence/absence of senescent cells. Recent progress in
the biology of cellular senescence provides another clue to
understanding the mechanism of cancer progression, as
well as to development of new anti-cancer drugs. This fact
suggests that senescence-inducing mechanisms might be
applicable as cancer therapies in the future.
Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes
The best characterized example of oncogene-induced
senescence is the response of normal fibroblasts to expres-
sion of an activated allele of H-ras (H-rasV12). Normal ras
proteins are important for transducing mitogenic signals
in the cell and are mutated to constitutively active forms
in approximately 20% of human cancers [18]. These acti-
vated alleles contribute to transformation in human can-
cer by increasing proliferation, and invasion of tumors, as
well as desensitizing cells to apoptosis [19]. All human
normal cells with intact p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb)
pathways enter into senesce in response to RAS. Expres-
sion of viral oncoproteins that disrupt these pathways,
such as simian virus 40 (SV40) T Ag, human papillomavi-
rus E6 or E7, or adenovirus E1A, block senescence and
cooperate with RAS to transform cells [20]. In contrast
than in human cells where the p16/Rb pathway plays a
more significant role, in murine cells, an intact p53/Arf
pathway is required for RAS-induced senescence.
It is of note that SIS and OIS can be bypassed partially by
inactivation of tumor suppressors, including the p53 or
Rb axis, implicating the involvement of several tumor
suppressor genes in these stress-induced senescence proc-
esses (Figure 2). In cancerous cells or tissues, tumor sup-
pressor genes may be inactivated by either deletion of one
or both alleles, promoter methylation, splice-site muta-
tions or nonsense mutations, or a combination of these.
Alternatively, mutations in tumor suppressor genes can
provide a dominant negative protein that interferes with
the wild-type protein produced by the other allele, as is
the case for several p53 mutants. Such genetic alterations
result in a complete absence or partial reduction of the
tumor suppressor protein, conferring a selective advan-
tage in clonal selection for tumor progression.
The presence of senescent cells has been demonstrated in
vivo to positively correlate with aging, illustrating that the
in vitro observation of replicative senescence is applicable
to the events in vivo [21]. Recently, a significant in vivo role
for the process of senescence was demonstrated. Several
groups have shown that benign tumors contain senescent
cells and that these cells fully disappeared in the malig-
nant counterparts of the described tumors. As the process
of senescence is observed both in vitro and in vivo [2,7,22],
tumor suppressor activation can be another target of can-
cer therapy in vivo. Promising results have been recently
reported in a murine model where complete tumor regres-
sion could be provoked by p53 activation [10,23,24]. In
vitro restoration of p53 function triggers dramatic and
rapid induction of p53 target genes, as well as apoptosis.
While several groups have reported similar effects, it is not
just p53 status itself that determines therapeutic efficacy
of p53 restoration, but also the status of p53-activating
signals that pre-exist, or can be induced, in tumor cells.
Although this situation would not be exactly the same as
that which occurs in human cancer (where p53 is affected
or the p53 pathway is corrupted), regression of these
tumors was closely correlated with the presence of senes-
cent cells. Thus, these studies provide the first evidence
that senescence induction in vivo can be a crucial mecha-
nism of tumor clearance. It would be worthwhile to fur-
ther investigate whether p53 activating chemicals, such as
quiacrine, might be beneficial for cancer patients.
The ARF/INK4a (Alternative Reading Frame) locus
encodes two distinct tumor suppressors, ARF (p14ARF in
humans and p19ARF in mice) and p16INK4A. p16INK4A and
ARF respectively regulate the pRB and p53 pathways of
senescence and tumor suppression [25]. p16INK4A binds
and inhibits cyclin-D-dependent kinases CDK4 and
CDK6. Such kinases have oncogenic potential because
they phosphorylate the retinoblastoma family of tumor
suppressors Rb, p107 and p130, which are negative regu-
lators of the cell cycle (Figure 2). ARF is an antagonist for
Mdm2, which regulates p53 stability through its p53-
degrading ubiquitin ligase activity. ARF sequesters
hmdm2 through its translocation to the nucleolus and the
final consequence is p53 activation and stabilization.
During replicative senescence in vitro, the accumulation of
these tumor suppressors (p53, ARF, INK4A) or their
downstream targets (p21Cip1) is observed [26]. Oncogenic
insults also upregulate these genes, including p53, ARF,
INK4, and p21Cip1. It is noteworthy that the ectopic
expression of these tumor suppressors (ARF, INK4,
p21Cip1) can provoke a senescence-like phenotype in pri-
mary or immortalized cells.
All of these senescence-inducing tumor suppressor genes
may also be targets of anti-cancer drugs. Several ARF tran-
Molecular Cancer 2009, 8:3 http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/8/1/3

scriptional repressors have been identified in a senescence
bypass screen, including TBX2 [27] and Zbtb7 or poke-
mon [28]. INK4 is known to be regulated by the Ets tran-
scriptional family. These regulators for ARF/INK4 might
be good candidates for anti-cancer drugs through modu-
lation of their senescence effect. However, as is often the
case with p53, the inactivation of the ARF/INK4a locus by
complete deletion or by aberrant promoter methylation is
very common, being present in about 30% of all known
types of malignancies. Presumably, in cancer cells harbor-
ing genetic inactivation of this locus, the modulation of
ARF/INK4 function would be less effective as cancer treat-
ment.
Alternatively, a CDK inhibitor may be a good tool, as both
the ARF/p53 and INK4/Rb axis exert their tumor suppress-
ing function partially via inactivation of CDK4. Several
small chemical modulators for CDK kinases are currently
under investigation in clinical trials. So far, these are not
CDK4-specific inhibitors, but rather pan-CDK inhibitors,
such as Fravopiridol, UCN-01, Roscovitine, and
BMS387032. The anti-cancer effects of these compounds
mainly result in induction of apoptosis rather than prov-
ocation of senescence. This is possible because CDKs play
additional and essential roles beyond cell cycle control,
including transcription, DNA repair, migration, and secre-
tion.
Telomeres
Human telomeres consist of tandem repetitive arrays of
the hexameric sequence TTAGGG. Overall telomere sizes
range from 15 kb at birth to <5 kb in old individuals, as
telomeres become progressively shorter with every round
of cell division in normal cells [29]. The length of telom-
eric DNA decreases progressively in primary cells as they
replicate. The ends of telomeres are protected and regu-
lated by telomere-binding proteins and form a special lar-
iat-like structure called the T-loop. Telomerase is a
complex cellular ribonucleoprotein enzyme composed of
a number of distinct subunits responsible for adding telo-

meric repeats to the 3'ends of chromosomes. It has two
major components, an enzymatic human telomerase tran-
scriptase catalytic subunit hTERT, and a RNA component
hTERC. Telomerase uses its integral RNA component as a
template in order to synthesize telomeric DNA directly
onto the ends of chromosomes. Primary normal human
cells stably expressing transfected telomerase can divide
indefinitely, providing direct evidence that telomere
shortening has a causal effect on replicative senescence
[30]. The enzyme is normally expressed in very few pri-
mary cells such as embryonic stem cells [18]. Interest-
ingly, some viral oncoproteins are able to modulate
telomerase expression and inhibition of telomerase limits
the growth of human cancer cells [19,20]. Telomerase is
also present in adult male germline cells, but it is undetec-
table in most normal somatic cells, with the exception of
proliferative cells of renewal tissues. It has been reported
that several human diseases, such as dyskeratosis, congen-
ital or aplastic anemia, are caused by the mutations in
genes encoding components of telomerase or telomere-
binding proteins. These mutations cause low telomerase
activity, accelerated telomere shortening, and diminished
proliferative capacity of hematopoietic progenitors.
Cellular senescence is a process that is triggered not only
by telomeric erosion but also by other forms of stress. Sev-
eral factors provoke senescence in a telomere-independ-
ent manner. Stress-induced senescence (SIS) can be
induced by DNA damage, ionizing radiation such as X-
rays or UV, and oxidative stress. Oncogene-induced senes-
cence (OIS) can be induced by oncogenic activation. The
most well-defined model of oncogene induced-senes-
cence is shown by an activated allele of the ras gene
(rasV12) whose overexpression is accompanied by a con-
comitant accumulation of p53 and p16INK4A proteins [21].
Interestingly, it has been shown that adenomas from mice
expressing a single activated K-ras allele undergo senes-
cence in vivo [7]. Several oncogenes are known to induce a
senescence response upon overexpression: ras, raf, MEK,
Akt, E2F1/3, mos, PTEN, NF1, Stat5, KLF-4, and Runx.
When senescence is induced by a stimuli such as onco-
genic ras or raf, by epigenetic changes, or by oxidative
damage, the ectopic expression of hTERT cannot confer
the senescence-bypassing effect [31]. However, in several
cases of telomere-independent senescence, the initiating
event can be triggered by a common mechanism. For
example, cellular damage caused by these stresses would
be recognized by cellular sensors of the DNA damage
checkpoint apparatus, leading to the activation of cell
cycle checkpoint responses, including ataxia telangiectasia
mutated ATM-Chk2 kinase and ATR/Chk1 signaling, and
recruitment of DNA repair foci. Tumor cells in clinical
specimens from various tissues such as breast and lung
carcinomas often show constitutive activation of DNA
damage signaling, including activated forms of check-
point kinases ATM and Chk2, phosphorylated histone
H2AX and p53, and foci formation by proteins such as
53BP1. In this way, phosphorylated p53 is stabilized and
protected from destruction. Indeed a single dsDNA break
occurring anywhere in the genome seems sufficient to
induce a measurable increase in p53 levels. The cellular
effects of p53 are mediated by its ability to transactivate
specific genes, including p21Cip1, 14-3-3-σ or Puma [32],
or its ability to induce downregulation of specific proteins
such as CDK4 and cyclin E [25]. Activation of DNA dam-
age signaling may be followed by changes in chromatin
structure as the formation of senescence-associated-hete-
rochromatin foci (SAHFs) [26]. SAHFs accumulate during
oncogene-induced senescence and are thought to stably
suppress the expression of E2F target genes by recruiting
Rb and heterochromatin proteins.
Telomerase activity is detected in approximately 90% of
all malignant tumors in comparison with their normal
counterparts. This suggests that telomerase may be a suit-
able target for anti-cancer drugs. It was demonstrated that
siRNA against telomerase or overexpression of a domi-
nant-negative mutant of telomerase abolished telomerase
activity and resulted in entry of cells into crisis [33]. Sev-
eral clinical trials targeting telomerase are ongoing for
advanced cancer patients. These include immunotherapy
(a vaccine against telomerase), inhibitory compounds
against telomerase activity (a telomerase template antago-
nist), and the modulation of telomeric structure (telomes-
tatin). The expected outcome of telomerase inhibition
should not only be to slow tumor growth, but also to
diminish the possibility of induced apoptosis, for the fol-
lowing reasons: The tumor suppressor p53 is presumed to
sense dysfunctional telomeres as damaged DNA, where-
upon it elicits the senescence response at least in part by
increasing expression of the cell cycle inhibitory protein,
p21Cip1. This, in turn, prevents the inactivation of p53
[34,35]. Thus, in p53-intact cells, accelerated telomeric
shortening by telomerase inhibitors could be sensed by
the p53 pathway and would be followed by initiation of
massive apoptotic death.
Telomerase activity is a useful prognosis indicator of the
outcome of neuroblastomas that are usually encountered
in very young children. Telomerase activity should be
incorporated into the clinical investigation of each indi-
vidual neuroblastoma at the time of diagnosis because its
mere presence/absence is sufficient basis for predicting
disease outcome [36]. Therefore, neuroblastomas would
be good candidates for the above-mentioned telomerase
inhibitors.

Micro-RNAs
Micro-RNAs (miRNA) are a novel class of non-protein
encoding genes that have appeared to play an important
role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expres-
sion [37]. Mature miRNAs are double-stranded RNA mol-
ecules ~22 nucleotides in length that are the product of
several processing steps of PolII-transcribed primary RNA
transcripts. The final step in the miRNA pathway is the
loading of one of the mature RNA strands into the RNA-
induced silencing complex (RISC) that subsequently
binds to a mRNA with a certain degree of complementa-
rity, often in the 3'UTR of the mRNA. Depending on the
degree of complementarity, miRNAs are involved in
sequence-specific degradation of mRNAs or inhibition of
protein translation [38]. One miRNA can control the
expression of many different genes, and it is speculated
that 20–30% of total gene expression may be regulated by
miRNAs. Bioinformatics approaches have identified 300
human miRNA genes, but more recent work has predicted
the number to be closer to 1,000 [39]. Recent studies have
shown that miRNA expression profiles are different
between normal and tumor tissues [38,39]. Interestingly,
downregulation of subsets of miRNAs is a common find-
ing in some tumors. The discovery that miRNA silencing
could revert the tumorigenic phenotype of the colon can-
cer cell line HCT116 unveils a novel regulatory mecha-
nism in cancer proliferation [40].
Recently, several laboratories have reported that members
of the miR-34 family are direct targets of p53, which
induces apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and senescence [41-
43]. Several miRNAs are significantly induced by p53,
including miR-16, which targets the oncogene bcl-2; and
let-7, which downregulates ras and HMGA2. Among the
mi-RNAs repressed by p53 is miR-221 which downregu-
lates p27.
In a genetic screen to identify miRNAs characterized by
their ability to bypass senescence induced by oncogenic
Ras (OIS), miR-372 and miR-373 were identified [44].
This study was performed in partially immortalized
IMR90 fibroblast. These miRNAs are considered novel
oncogenes participating in the development of human
testicular germ cell tumors by numbing the p53 pathway
and promoting tumorigenic growth in the presence of
wild-type p53. Importantly, the fact that miR-373 is able
to form foci in soft-agar assays shows its transforming
capability. On the contrary, introduction of miR-34a and
miR-34b/c into primary human diploid fibroblasts
induced cellular senescence [45]. Tumor cells also showed
signs of senescence after introduction of ectopic miR-34a
[46]. Downregulation of miR-138 is associated with over-
expression of telomerase and the acquisition of malignant
behavior in human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell lines
[47]. Thereby, it is expected that targeting miR-138 would
be useful as a diagnostic tool or might contribute to the
development of new strategic treatments for specific kinds
of carcinomas as already suggested for miR-378 [48].
Oxidative stress
Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) can produce serious dam-
age in cells [49]. Cumulative oxidative damage causes or
accelerates senescence, while immortalized cells are resist-
ant to the senescence effect of oxidative damage. The most
dramatic observations have been reported when cells have
been exposed to different oxygen concentrations. When
oxygen is reduced from 20% to 1–5%, human diploid
fibroblasts increase their replicative life-span between 20–
50% [49]. In this sense, the modulation of oxidative stress
could be another target of cancer therapy.
It has been reported that enhanced glycolysis via ectopic
expression of a glycolytic enzyme (phosphoglycerate
mutase; PGM) immortalizes primary MEFs, protecting
them from oxidative damage [50]. Enhanced glycolysis is
a well-known property of most cancerous cells and tis-
sues, commonly referred to as the Warburg effect. This
property is well utilized in clinical practice for the detec-
tion of metastatic tumor mass through positron-emission
scanning of 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose [51]. Thus,
inhibition of glycolysis may represent an alternative ther-
apy for cancer treatment. PGM inhibition in primary
MEFs induced premature senescence. Indeed, the PGM
inhibitor MJE3 has been identified as the most potent
anti-proliferative reagent via chemical screening in breast
cancer cells [50].
Currently several glycolitic inhibitors with promising
results in cultured cells and animal models are being
tested in clinical trials. For example, preclinical studies
include 3-Bromopyruvate (3-BrPA) in clinical trials (I/II).
A compound at a further stage of testing is 2-Deoxyglu-
cose (2-DG), in clinical trials (II/III). 3-BrPA inhibits hex-
okinase causing a depletion in ATP leading to massive cell
death in those cells with respiration defects. 2-DG is an
agent that is phosphorylated by hexokinase, but it cannot
be further metabolized and thus blocks glucose metabo-
lism [52]. 2-DG has shown promising results enhancing
significantly the anti-cancer activity of adriamycin and
paclitaxel in mice bearing human osteosarcoma and non-
small-cell lung cancer xenographs [53].
Collectively, senescence induction would be a good tool
for cancer treatment in the future. A personalized genetic
test of the status of several oncogenes and tumor suppres-
sors, including ras, p53, p16INK4A, ARF and hTERT, should
be carefully examined before senescence-induction treat-
ment. Once the status of these senescence-associated
genes is known, it should be easier to predict the sensitiv-

ity or resistance of a tumor to senescence-induction treat-
ment.
Epigenetics
Epigenetic changes occur constantly in wild-type mam-
malian cells as a dinamic feature that involves the activa-
tion/inactivation of numerous genes. Examples of
epigenetic changes are: methylation of DNA, histone
deacetylation, ubiquitination and phosphorylation. Over-
all these changes, DNA methylation is considered to play
an essential role in cellular senescence and aging [54]. It
has been demonstrated that the methylation level in the
genome decrease gradually during SIS as well as replica-
tive senescence. This has been associated with the reduc-
tion in the expression of the methylation enzyme
DNMT1. Such changes reflect global hypomethylation as
a distinct feature of senescent cells [55]. SIS share some
features of replicative senescence, such as basic biological
characteristics and global hypomethylation while there
are slight differences in the profile of methylation-associ-
ated enzyme expression. Aging is accompanied by
changes in DNA methylation in tumor suppressor genes
and by stochastic methylation events through the
genome. Thereby, aging-related random methylation has
been proposed to occur as a result of failure of methyl-
transferase activity, and/or exposure to environmental fac-
tors and health of the individual [56].
The pattern of altered gene expression or epigenetic
changes is of major importance in common malignancies.
DNA methylation patterns are severely affected in cancer.
p16INK4A, possibly after p53, is the most important tumor
suppressor gene altered in human cancer. Methylation of
the p16INK4A promoter implies p16INK4A silencing and sub-
sequently the loss of the p16INK4A protein. p16INK4A pro-
moter methylation occurs in specific cancers as breast and
hepatocellular carcinoma. Importantly, promoter hyper-
methylation of the p16INK4A gene is associated with poor
prognosis in recurrent early-stage hepatocellular carci-
noma [57]. However, although a great number of tumor
suppressor genes are hypermethylated in regions rich in
CpG (CpG island); paradoxically the general pattern of
the cancer genome is a general DNA hypomethylation.
Interestingly, epigenetic changes that occur in cellular
senescence in vitro in HMECs constitute again a good
model to recapitulate the adquisition of premalignant
lesions in vivo [58]. For example p16INK4A inactivation by
promoter methylation is one early event that contribute to
HMEC immortalization. Interestingly, our group have
recently identified in a loss-of-function genetic screen the
methylation enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase
(SAHH). SAHH inactivation bypass replicative senescence
and induces immortalization in primary murine cells
affecting both the p53 and pRb pathways [17]. In addi-
tion, SAHH has been found altered in human tumors at
mRNA and protein levels suggesting that it could be a
putative novel tumor suppressor gene [17]. The fact that
SAHH is able to modulate senescence reinforces the
importance of methylation enzymes in immortalization
and cancer development.
In order to stimulate the expression of those tumor sup-
pressor genes silenced in cancer, much attention has
recently been focused on developing small molecule
inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases that could be used
as anti-cancer drugs such as 5-Azacytidine and 5'-Aza-2'-
deoxycytidine (decitabine). Surprinsingly, they have been
quite effective in leukemias, however in solid tumors they
have not been very successful. Importantly, the lack of p53
inducibility of apoptotic genes, has been restored by treat-
ment with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine suggesting that epige-
netic cancer therapy is possible for some cancers in
combination with forced p53 activation [59]. Impor-
tantly, while the acquisition of spontaneous mutations
that disable p53 or pRB in a resting cell without DNA rep-
lication seems rather unlikely, epigenetic changes might
occur in senescent cells. If this represents an additional
barrier to take into account before applying a senescence
induced anti-cancer therapy, it deserves deeply and exten-
sive investigations.
Conclusion
Cellular senescence has become an attractive therapeutic
concept because mimics programmed cell death by
excluding cells from active progression through the cell
cycle. As an intact apoptotic machinery is unavailable in
most established malignancies, a senescence-induced
mechanism emerges as a back-up program to substitute
for or to reinforce an insufficient apoptotic response.
Importantly, the therapeutic potential of senescence
induction strongly relies on the irreversibility of this proc-
ess. Although, it has not been formally tested whether
drug-inducible senescence is a complete reversible proc-
ess, the acquisition of spontaneous mutations that disable
p53 or pRB in a resting cell without DNA replication
seems rather unlikely. Thereby it would be very interesting
for preclinical investigations to explore future therapies
which directly prompt a clear senescence response as
those observed in vitro (Figure 3). It would be tempting to
speculate that the combination of a senescence induced
therapy and a conventional therapy might cooperate to
entirely abolish cancer.
