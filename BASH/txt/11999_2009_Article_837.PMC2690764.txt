Abstract Although uncemented cup implants frequently
are used in young patients, we believe long-term survival
rates of cups in these patients are somewhat disappointing,
and therefore we have continued to use cemented cups in
primary THA, even in young patients. However, in cases of
acetabular bone stock defects, we also use bone impaction
grafting. We prospectively followed 130 patients with 175
cemented cups; no patients were lost to followup. The
mean age of the patients at surgery was 31 years (range,
16–39 years). An acetabular reconstruction with bone
impaction grafting was performed in 84 hips (48%). The
minimum followup was 2 years (average, 8.1 years; range,
2.0–18.5 years). Twenty-one of the 175 cups (12%) were
revised at an average of 8.1 years (range, 2.0–18.5 years).
Reasons for revision were infection (one early, seven late),
recurrent dislocations (two), traumatic loosening (one), and
aseptic loosening (10). The 10-year survival rate of all
cemented cups with end point of revision for any cause was
85%. Survival with end point of aseptic loosening of all
cups was 92%. Survival with end point of revision for
aseptic loosening was 90% for the cups without impaction
grafting and 95% for the cups with impaction grafting. We
believe cemented acetabular cups in young patients have
acceptable midterm survival; however, in the case of ace-
tabular bone defects, we recommend reconstruction with
impaction grafting.

Introduction
Obtaining a satisfying long-term survival of THAs in
patients younger than 40 years remains a challenge. Young
patients must function longer with their THA than the
typical patient who has a THA, and they also engage in a
higher level of activity, which is associated with higher
revision rates [19, 27]. Therefore, this population is more
dependent on durable implants with excellent long-term
survival. Although stem survival is acceptable in most
studies, in general, cup survival is the weakest link in
patients younger than 40 years [5, 8, 9, 15, 18, 20, 25]. The
difference in reported survival rates between the cup and
stem varies from 1% (97% [stem] versus 96% [cup] [18])
to 11% (98.3% [stem] versus 87.6% [cup] [20]). Despite
attempts to improve cup designs and using new materials in
THA, the acetabular component still shows lower survival
rates than femoral implants.
One popular option is to implant uncemented acetabular
cups in young patients as part of a total uncemented THA
or hybrid THA (uncemented cup, cemented stem).

[1, 24, 35], we always have implanted cemented cups in
patients of all ages, but with one substantial modiﬁcation:
in all patients with substantial acetabular bone stock deﬁ-
ciencies, we have reconstructed this bone stock loss using
impaction bone grafting with a cemented cup. Secondary
osteoarthritis resulting from underlying diseases in these
young patients often is seen with associated loss of ace-
tabular bone stock (for example, in developmental
dysplasia of the hips and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis).
With this approach using cemented cups in young
patients for many years, we asked whether there were any
differences between cemented cups in young patients
(younger than 40 years) with and without reconstruction
with impaction grafting concerning (1) clinical scores, (2)
revisions, (3) complications, (4) radiographic appearances,
(5) polyethylene wear, and (6) survival.
Materials and Methods
We retrospectively reviewed prospectively collected data
of all 130 patients (175 hips) who had a primary THA in
our department between January 1988 and July 2004 and
who were younger than 40 years at the time of index sur-
gery. We used a cemented femoral stem and cemented
acetabular polyethylene cup in all patients. In patients with
acetabular bone deﬁciencies, these deﬁciencies were
reconstructed with the impaction grafting technique. The
decision to use bone impaction grafting was made based on
the preoperative radiographs in combination with intraop-
erative ﬁndings. A trial cup was placed on the transverse
ligament; in the case of a protrusion hip or a superolateral
rim defect, a reconstruction was performed. Eighty-four
hips (48%) had impaction grafting whereas 91 (52%) did
not have impaction grafting. Because a cemented THA was
our only treatment technique, patients with all diagnoses
were included (Table 1). The majority (62%) of the
patients had developmental dysplasia of the hips, rheu-
matoid arthritis, or corticosteroid-induced avascular
necrosis. Fifty-ﬁve (42%) patients were males and 75
(58%) were females. Eighty-nine (51%) THAs were on the
left side and 86 (49%) were on the right. Forty-ﬁve (35%)
patients had bilateral THAs. The average age of the
patients at index surgery was 31.3 years (range, 16–
39 years). The mean body mass index was 25.5 (range,
17.9–36.3). According to the classiﬁcation of Charnley [7],
46 hips were in Category A, 71 in B, and 58 in C. We
followed all patients in this prospective cohort on a regular
basis and the minimum followup was 2 years (average,
8.1 years; range, 2.0–18.5 years) after surgery. During
followup, six patients (eight hips) died of causes not related
to the hip or hip surgery. All patients who died were

followed on a regular basis and their data included; none
had revision surgery. Of the original group of 175 cups, the
data of only one patient were incomplete. Based on a
telephone interview, the prosthesis of this patient func-
tioned well; however, a recent radiograph was missing.
We categorized acetabular defects in accordance with
the classiﬁcation system of the American Academy of
Orthopaedic Surgeons [10]. Eighty-six hips (49%) had an
acetabular deﬁciency. Type I segmental deﬁciencies
occurred in 16 hips, Type II cavitary defects in 39 hips, and
Type III combined deﬁciencies in 29 hips. One patient (two
hips) had ankylosis of the hips, a Type V deﬁciency. Using
impaction grafting, we reconstructed all deﬁciencies,
including mild cavitary defects; however most were larger
defects.
Differences between the two groups (with and without
impaction grafting) were analyzed regarding diagnosis and
gender (chi square test, both p = 0.001). In the group with
an acetabular reconstruction, a larger proportion was
female and was diagnosed with developmental dysplasia of
the hips compared with the group without reconstruction.
There were no differences regarding age at surgery, side,
bilateral THAs, followup, type of cup used, cup inner
diameter, and body mass index between the two groups.
Two-thirds of the operations (67%) were performed by
or under the supervision of two senior faculty orthopaedic
surgeons (BWS, JWMG). A posterolateral approach with-
out trochanteric osteotomy was used in all hips, with the
exception of two. Intraoperatively, in one patient, a pre-
planned Sugioka procedure was converted to a THA;
however, a trochanteric osteotomy already had been per-
formed. In the other patient, a trochanteric osteotomy was
performed in a technically demanding hip with a short
femoral neck. In one patient, an additional anterior
approach was needed because of ankylosis of the hip. All
acetabular deﬁciencies were reconstructed (with the
exception of one case) with impaction grafting using
autografts and/or allografts in 84 hips (48%); this technique
has been described in detail [28–30]. Segmental bone
defects ﬁrst were reconstructed with wire meshes before
the morselized bone graft was impacted and a conventional
full polyethylene cup was cemented. In one patient, we
reconstructed a lateral rim deﬁciency without impaction
grafting using a solid autograft ﬁxed with two screws. In
one of the ankylosed hips (Type V deﬁciency), we did not
use impaction grafting. We used allografts only with
impaction grafting in four hips (4.8%), autografts only in
72 hips (85.7%), and combined allografts and autografts in
eight hips (9.5%). Allografts were used when the original
femoral head was not large enough to reconstruct the defect
or in cases with pathologic femoral heads (for example,
avascular necrosis of the femoral head). In three cases,
instead of a solitary metal mesh, a solid fragment was used
in combination with impaction grafting. In two of these
cases, a minor segmental defect in the medial wall was
closed using a cortical-trabecular fragment of a femoral
head. A wire mesh was placed medial on top of the frag-
ment and the acetabulum was reconstructed with impaction
grafting. In the third case, a cortical head fragment was
used to support the anterior rim together with a rim mesh in
a reconstruction. The number of femoral heads used as
grafts varied from one to four. In 40 hips (48%), metal wire
mesh was used for acetabular reconstruction with impac-
tion grafting (10 medial wall meshes, 39 rim meshes). In
nine early cases, we placed a mesh on top of the bone graft
just before cementation, but this mesh was not part of a
segmental defect reconstruction. However, after we real-
ized this mesh did not add any stability to the
reconstruction and there were no signs of damaging of the
graft or graft healing by direct contact with cement, we
abandoned the use of a mesh for this purpose.
We used 79 (45%) ExeterTM

cups with
an inner diameter of 28 mm (n = 75) and 22.225 mm
(n = 5) (Stryker Howmedica, Newbury, UK), 71 (41%)
Charnley1
EliteTM
cups with an inner diameter of
22.225 mm (n = 6) or 28 mm (n = 65) (DePuy, Leeds,
UK), and 25 (14%) Mu¨ller/AlloPro cups with an inner
diameter of 32 mm (n = 19), 28 mm (n = 2), or
22.225 mm (n = 4) (Sulzer, Winterthur, Switzerland). For
the femoral component, we used an ExeterTM
stem in 111
cases, a Charnley1
EliteTM
stem in 48 cases, and a Mu¨ller
stem in 16 cases. All femoral heads used were made of a
cobalt-chrome alloy; no ceramic implants were used.
We cemented acetabular components with a third-gen-
eration cementing technique. In the directly cemented cups,
after reaming, multiple small drill holes were made with a
2.6-mm drill. After using pulse lavage, vacuum-mixed
cement was injected directly from the cement gun and the
cement was pressurized by a seal. In cases of reconstruc-
tion with bone grafts, we reamed the acetabulum, made
multiple drill holes in sclerotic areas, and irrigated the
acetabulum. Next the bone graft was impacted. Again,
vacuum-mixed cement was injected and pressurized and
the cup was inserted. Before 1989, we used Palacos1
bone
cement (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany); however, since
1989, we have used Surgical Simplex1
(Stryker How-
medica). In 165 cases (94%), cement loaded with
antibiotics was used. All patients received antibiotic pro-
phylaxis consisting of 2 g cefazolin intravenously just
before surgery. Other precautionary measures to prevent
infections were use of an operating theater with laminar
airﬂow and use of two pairs of sterile gloves.
Postoperatively, all patients received thrombosis pro-
phylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin for 6 weeks,
or before 1999, with acenocoumarol (the individual dosage
regimens regulated with regular coagulation tests) for

3 months. To prevent heterotopic ossiﬁcation, we used
nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 7 days.
In six patients in whom NSAIDs were contraindicated, we
administered one dose (7 Gy) of radiotherapy 1 day
postoperatively.
Patients without acetabular reconstruction were mobi-
lized under supervision of a physiotherapist after 1 or
2 days. Full weightbearing was increased in 2 to 6 weeks
with the aid of one or two crutches. The patients who
underwent impaction grafting were mobilized according to
a modiﬁed protocol; in the ﬁrst 6 weeks, only 10%
weightbearing was allowed and then 6 to 12 weeks of 50%
weightbearing using two crutches was allowed. After
12 weeks, full weightbearing mobilization was allowed.
Thirty-one hips had such an extensive reconstruction of
major defects that several weeks of bed rest were main-
tained ranging from 1 to 6 weeks. We used this modiﬁed
mobilization protocol to ensure graft incorporation before
full weightbearing.
Routine followups were scheduled at 6 weeks; 3, 6, and
12 months; and yearly or biannually thereafter. At our
outpatient clinic, student researchers not participating in
the treatment performed clinical analysis using the Harris
hip score [17], the Oxford Hip Questionnaire Score (since
1998) [11], and visual analog scales for pain during rest
and physical activity on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 100
(unbearable pain). We report the clinical scores of all
patients excluding the 21 patients whose hips were revised
during followup.
All anteroposterior pelvis and lateral radiographs of all
hips were analyzed on a consensus basis by two of the
authors (DCJDK, BWS). Radiographic evaluation included
assessment of cup position, loosening of the acetabular
component, polyethylene wear, presence of osteolysis,
structural quality of the bone graft, application and position
of the meshes, migration, heterotopic ossiﬁcation, and
fracture of the cement, mesh, or prosthesis. Radiolucent
lines and osteolysis were recorded according to the three
acetabular zones as described by DeLee and Charnley [12].
Radiographic loosening was deﬁned as 2 mm or greater
demarcation in two or three zones around the acetabular
component, progressive demarcation, 3 mm or greater
component migration, 5° or greater component tilting, and/
or cement or prosthesis fracture. We determined cup
migration ([ 3-mm shift in any direction or [ 5° tilting) in
relation to the interteardrop line instead of the Kohler line
[16]. Position of the cup of 45° ± 10° was considered
normal [26]. We calculated polyethylene wear using the
method of Dorr and Wan [13]. All measurements were
corrected for magniﬁcation. Heterotopic ossiﬁcation was
classiﬁed according to the system of Brooker et al. [6].
Graft incorporation was deﬁned as the presence of the
crossing of trabecular bone on the bone-graft interface on

the radiographs. Clinical failure was deﬁned as the need for
revision of the acetabular component for any reason.
We calculated Kaplan-Meier curves to study the sur-
vival (time to revision). The end points were (1) cup
revision for any reason, (2) cup revision for any reason
excluding infections, (3) cup revision for aseptic loosening,
and (4) radiographic signs of cup loosening. With an
average followup of 8.1 years, 30% of all patients had a
followup longer than 10 years. The log-rank test was used
to test the differences in survival between cups with and
without impaction grafting. Differences in outcomes
between the groups were determined with the Student’s t-
test (continuous variables after checking for normal dis-
tribution) or chi square test (nominal variables).
Results
The outcome of the Harris hip score and the Oxford Hip
Questionnaire Score improved (p \ 0.0001) after surgery
for both groups; there were no differences in preoperative
and postoperative clinical outcomes between the cups with
and without acetabular reconstruction (Table 2). The
postoperative experienced pain score was low.
The number of revisions in the groups with and without
bone grafts was not different (p = 0.152). At last followup,
21 of the 175 cups (12%) had been revised, seven of which
had reconstruction with impaction grafting (Table 3).
Reasons for revision were infection (eight), recurrent dis-
locations (two), traumatic loosening (one), and aseptic
loosening (10). Revision for aseptic loosening was per-
formed in 10 acetabular implants (5.7%). The cup only was
revised in eight cases and the cup and stem were revised in
two cases. Four of the 10 revised cups had reconstruction
with impaction grafting and six cups were implanted with
standard techniques without any graft. The failed cups
reconstructed with impaction grafting were revised after
4.1, 9.8, 16.2, and 16.8 years (average, 11.7 years). The six
directly cemented cups were revised after an average of
4.0 years (range, 1.1–10.0 years). The time to revision for
aseptic loosening was longer (p = 0.032) for the recon-
structed cups with impaction grafting than for the cups
implanted with standard techniques. The eight infected hips
(4.6%) all had revision because of culture-proven infection

of the implant. The average time to revision for septic
loosening was 5.3 years (range, 2.2–8.1 years). Staphylo-
coccus epidermidis was isolated in three, Staphylococcus
aureus in two, Proprioni in two, Pseudomonas aeruginosa
in one, and Streptococcus oralis in one. As a result of
recurrent dislocations, two cups (1.1%) were revised at 3.5
and 8.6 years after the index operation. One implant (0.6%)
was radiographically and clinically loose after trauma and
needed revision of both components.
We observed similar (p = 0.959) numbers of overall
complications in the groups with and without bone grafts.
However, dislocations were more common (p = 0.045) in
the group without bone grafts than in the group with bone
grafts (15 versus 5, respectively). Patients without recon-
struction with impaction grafting had an increased
dislocation chance of 1:2.9. During followup, there were
nine intraoperative complications and 30 postoperative
complications (Table 4). One additional stem was revised
because of aseptic loosening and two femoral heads were
exchanged because of recurrent dislocations. Seven hips
underwent additional surgery because of postoperative
complications (Table 4).
There were no differences between the cups with and
without acetabular reconstruction concerning the occur-
rence of cup migration, radiographic loosening, or the
presence of osteolysis, cysts, and abnormal cup position
(Table 5). Cups with impaction grafting had fewer radio-
lucent lines (p = 0.02) and fewer lines in Zone I
(p = 0.001) (Table 5). All lines, except two, were on the
bone-cement interface. In 28 (48%) of the 58 cups with
radiolucent lines, the lines were progressive. Of the 175
hips, 160 were radiographically stable (Fig. 1). Fifteen
cups were difﬁcult to evaluate because of overlap of the
metal mesh (11 Zone I; four Zones I + II). We observed
graft osteolysis in only one patient with impaction grafting;
all other grafts were fully incorporated. The hip revised
because of traumatic loosening had a fracture in Zone II of
the acetabulum; no other fractures were seen. Fifteen
(8.6%) cups were radiographically loose, three had cup
migration (after 1.8, 9.8, and 11.2 years postoperatively),
and 12 had evident radiolucent lines in all zones and/or
severe osteolysis; 12 of these cups were revised (Table 3).
There was no difference in polyethylene wear rates
between the cups with and without impaction grafting
(p = 0.539 in 154 unrevised cups and p = 0.525 in the 21
revised cups) (Table 5). When looking at all cups (with and
without acetabular reconstruction), the revised and radio-
graphically loose cups had more wear compared with the
cups that were not revised (both p \ 0.0001). Patients with
an abnormal position of the cup had similar (p = 0.196)
polyethylene wear rates to those who had a normal posi-
tion. Analysis of polyethylene wear rates of cups with
different inner diameters showed no differences
(independent t test, 22 versus 28 mm: p = 0.135, 22 versus
32 mm: p = 0.484, 28 versus 32 mm: p = 0.620).
There were no differences in survival after 10 years
between the groups with and without bone impaction
grafting (Table 6). The midterm survival rates of all
cemented polyethylene cups varied from 85% to 92% at
10 years with four end points (Table 6; Figs. 2, 3). Cup
survival with an end point of radiographic loosening was
89% (95% conﬁdence interval, 83%–95%).
Discussion
The use of cemented THA in young patients is not very
popular and most surgeons will use uncemented or will
resurface hips in these patients. However, we have con-
tinued to use only cemented implants in THA even in

young patients. In our view, the real challenge in THA in
these young patients is to manage the commonly seen
acetabular deﬁciencies. In cases of acetabular defects, we
reconstruct these deﬁciencies with impaction bone grafting.
We questioned whether there was a difference in clinical
outcome, revisions, complications, radiographic appear-
ances, polyethylene wear, and survival between the cups
implanted with an acetabular reconstruction with impaction
grafting and those implanted with standard cementing
techniques.
Our study has several limitations: short followup, lack of
assessment of activity levels, clinical interobserver vari-
ability, heterogeneous group, no comparison with other
reconstruction techniques, and different types of implants
used. With no patients lost to followup, our followup is
representative and reliable for the midterm results [22], and
long-term followup ([ 15 years) was not available at the
time of this review. Our results can be biased by an
important factor we did not evaluate: the level of activity.
Theoretically, with restoration of the affected hip(s) into
well-functioning artiﬁcial joints, most patients will increase
their level of activity. However, young patients undergoing
THA with acetabular deﬁciencies and therefore more
complex reconstructions could still have a lower level of
activity after surgery relative to primary cemented cups.
However, the average wear of the cups with impaction
grafting was the same as the cups without impaction
grafting (both 0.08 mm/year). Provided that activity is a
major cause of polyethylene wear, this might imply the
level of activity is similar in these two groups. Several
studies suggest the revision and polyethylene wear rates are
correlated to level of activity [2, 19, 27, 31, 38]. Additional
research on level of activity and impaction grafting in
young patients is necessary to conﬁrm this hypothesis. The
clinical questionnaires were obtained by student research-
ers who did not participate in the treatment. Multiple
researchers were involved in the data collection and
interobserver variability has not been tested; however, all
researchers were trained and supervised to obtain these
questionnaires correctly.

The clinical scores were comparable between the two
groups and comparable to published scores (Table 7).
Although the cups reconstructed with bone impaction
grafting were the more demanding procedures, no clinical
differences were seen.
Although revision rates in both groups were comparable,
the time to revision was longer in the cups reconstructed
with bone impaction grafting. We have no clear explana-
tion for this observation; possibly the cement-bone
interface was better in cups with bone impaction grafting
with better interdigitation of the cement into the bone [36].
This also may explain the lower incidence of radiolucent
lines in the cups reconstructed with bone impaction graft-
ing. The number of revisions for septic loosening was
relatively high during this midterm followup study (4.6%).
Only one septic loosening likely was related to the surgery;

we considered all other infections acute hematogenous
infections of previously well-functioning prostheses. The
use of corticosteroids and newer rheumatic disease-
modifying drugs, which were used in most of the infection
cases, can explain this higher risk of infection [3, 4].
Sochart and Porter [33] had only two infectionsin their study,
but both were in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Still, our
revision rate for septic loosening of 4.6% is relatively high
in contrast to other studies, such as that of Joshi et al. [18],
with an infection rate of 1.3%. Remarkably, many septic
loosenings occurred late ([ 2 years postoperatively).
The cups reconstructed with impaction grafting showed
fewer complications by having fewer dislocations than the
cups implanted by standard techniques. This might be
attributed to the different mobilization protocol for the
patients who received cups with impaction grafting.
Immobilization is associated with lower dislocation rates
[21]. The overall dislocation rate in our study was 11.4%,
which is relatively high. However, subluxation rates in
young patients having THA have been reported to be as
much as 18.2% [14]. The overall complication rate of 17%
(30 postoperative complications) is also relatively high.
Joshi et al. [18] reported a complication rate of 11.5% in
cemented hips and Duffy et al. [15] reported a complica-
tion rate of 12% during the perioperative period.
As expected, revised and radiographically loose cups
showed more polyethylene wear. This is consistent with
previous reports showing wear particles are associated with
osteolysis in THA [27, 33, 37]. The average wear rate of
the cups of 0.08 mm/year is within the normal limits,
keeping in mind that wear in younger patients can be 33%
to 40% higher than wear in older patients [27]. In a large
study of 226 hips in patients younger than 40 years with a
Charnley1
prosthesis, Sochart and Porter [33] reported an
average wear rate of 0.08 to 0.10 mm/year in the nonre-
vised cups, which is comparable to our results. Wan et al.
[37] found a correlation between inclination of the cup and
higher/lower wear rates. However, we did not observe
higher wear with abnormal position or inner cup diameter.
The observed overall midterm survival of cemented
polyethylene cups in patients younger than 40 years in our
study was acceptable. Especially in these young patients,
there is a need for total hip implants with proven long-term
survival [20]. Although the use of uncemented prostheses
in these young patients is very popular, literature regarding

long-term outcome of THA in patients younger than
40 years concerns mainly studies of cemented implants and
less about uncemented implants (Table 8) [5, 8, 9, 15, 18,
20, 25, 32–34]. A limitation of the reported midterm or
long-term results of uncemented cups is the fact that in
these studies ﬁrst-generation uncemented cups were used.
The long-term outcome of improved newer uncemented
cup designs remains unclear. Most of these older cup
designs no longer are available. The only report of unce-
mented cups at 15 years after surgery with an end point of
revision for any reason showed a survival rate of 54% [20].
This is less favorable than the results of cemented cups at
that time (Table 8). Sochart and Porter [34] had survival
rates of 71% and 68% at 20 and 25 years, respectively, for
cemented Charnley1
cups. The survival of the acetabular
uncemented cups with an end point of revision for aseptic
loosening in patients younger than 40 years reported in one
study was 85% [15], in contrast to a survival rate of 96%
after 10 years of the Charnley1
cups in the study by Joshi
et al. [18]. We found a survival rate with cemented cups of
92% at 10 years with an end point of revision for aseptic
loosening.
A remarkable ﬁnding of our study was the survival of
cups with acetabular reconstructions with impaction
grafting was at least comparable to the survival of stan-
dard cemented cups, especially considering the more
difﬁcult hips of our study population needed reconstruc-
tion with impaction grafting. Our data on the cemented
cups with impaction grafting showed similar survival,
where rather lower survival rates would be expected. The
outcome of these cups reconstructed with impaction
grafting even fulﬁlled the NICE criteria (a survival
of [ 90% after 10 years) [23], with a survival rate of
91% at 10 years with an end point of revision for any
reason. The survival rates of the cemented cups in our
study are comparable to those reported for cemented cups
[8, 18, 34].
Although cemented cups are not commonly used in
young patients, our data suggest cemented conventional
polyethylene cups are still a good option in THA in young
patients. Even reconstruction of (severe) acetabular deﬁ-
ciencies with impaction grafting and a cemented
conventional polyethylene cup produced very acceptable
survival rates, comparable to the rates of cemented cups
implanted in acetabuli without deﬁciencies with standard
cementing techniques.
