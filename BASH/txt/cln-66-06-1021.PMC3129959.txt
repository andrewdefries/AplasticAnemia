OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to characterize the neuroinfection profile in a tertiary neurological ward.
INTRODUCTION: Neuroinfection is a worldwide concern and bacterial meningitis, tetanus and cerebral malaria have
been reported as the commonest causes in developing countries.
METHODS: From 1999 to 2007, all patients admitted to the Neurology Ward of Hospital das Clı´nicas, Sa˜o Paulo
University School of Medicine because of neuroinfection had their medical records reviewed. Age, gender,
immunological status, neurological syndrome at presentation, infectious agent and clinical outcome were recorded.
RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy four cases of neuroinfectious diseases accounted for 4.2% of ward admissions
and the identification of infectious agent was successful in 81% of cases. Mean age was 40.5¡13.4 years, 63.8%
were male, 19.7% were immunocompromised patients and meningoencephalitis was the most common clinical
presentation despite infectious agent. Viruses and bacteria were equally responsible for 29.4% of neuroinfectious
diseases; parasitic, fungal and prion infections accounted for 28%, 9.6% and 3.5% respectively. Human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Treponema pallidum,
Taenia solium, Schistosoma mansoni, Cryptococcus neoformans and Histoplasma capsulatum were the more
common infectious pathogens in the patients. Infection mortality rate was 14.2%, of which 62.3% occurred in
immunocompetent patients.
CONCLUSION: Our institution appeared to share some results with developed and developing countries.
Comparison with literature may be considered as quality control to health assistance.

INTRODUCTION
Neuroinfection is a worldwide concern and an important
cause of morbidity and mortality. Bacterial meningitis,
tetanus and cerebral malaria have been reported as the
commonest causes of neuroinfection in developing coun-
tries.1,2
Mainly resulting from African countries, these data
may not only reflect the poorest communities of developing
countries, but also the inadequacy of hospital infrastructure
and laboratory resources associated with civil war in many
of these countries.3
However, differences in economical,
political and climatic characteristics, and quality of health
assistance, could contribute to distinct epidemiological data.
The current study was undertaken to determine the
frequency and characterize clinical aspects of neuroinfection
admitted to our tropical neurological ward.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This retrospective study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of Hospital das Clı´nicas, Sa˜o Paulo University
School of Medicine, Brazil. Our tertiary teaching hospital
has 970 beds, of which 26 belong to the Neurology Division
which also has an infectious diseases ward that receives the
majority of infectious cases. From 12 December 1999 to 12
December 2007, all patients admitted because of neuroinfec-
tion had their medical records reviewed. The main inclusion
criterion was positive infectious pathogen identification,
including our previously reported cases.4,5
Although we
had patients with undetermined infectious agents, we also
included patients who had neurological manifestations and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities that suggested
infectious disease. Clinical improvement occurring after
antibiotic treatment and other non-infectious etiologies were
excluded. Age, gender, immunological status, neurological

syndrome, infectious agent and clinical outcome were
recorded when the inclusion criteria had been fulfilled.
Neurological syndromes were classified as: meningitis;
meningoencephalitis; stroke; and, myelitis.6
Confirmed by
electroneuromyographic studies, peripheral nervous system
(PNS) encompassed spinal roots, plexuses or peripheral
nerve affection.7
Clinical involvement of cerebellar and/or
brain stem structures was recorded as posterior fossa and
brain space occupying lesion was applied when abscess or
granuloma were seen during imaging studies despite
neurological signs. Simultaneous or serial inflammation of
the meninges, brain, medulla and spinal roots were
classified as overlap involvement. Computerized tomogra-
phy (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and extensive
blood and CSF analyses were carried out in all patients. The
infectious agent was identified from CSF (Gram staining,
culture, antibody detection or protein chain reaction) or
nervous tissue samples (histology and/or culture). The
outcome was classified as death, and unaltered or improved
based on neurological examination at hospital discharge.
RESULTS
Between 1999 and 2007, 8760 patients were admitted.
Cerebrovascular diseases and pulse therapy for multiple
sclerosis and non-infectious inflammatory neuropathies
were the main reasons for admission. Initial diagnosis of
neuroinfection occurred in 416 patients, but 42 were
excluded after laboratorial investigation: systemic lupus
erythematosus (3), chronic idiopathic meningitis with low
glucose level (1), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (2), Behc¸et
disease (17), sarcoidosis (5), meningeal carcinomatosis (2),
undetermined eosynophilic meningitis (2) and Rasmussen’s
encephalitis (10). The inclusion criteria were fulfilled by 374
patients (4.2%, 374/8760), mean age was 40.5¡13.4 years
(range: 13–88 years), and 63.8% were male. Sixty-nine
(18.4%, 69/374) patients were immunocompromised as a
result of solid organ transplantation (7), acquired immuno-
deficiency syndrome (AIDS; 42), diabetes mellitus (7),
chronic hepatopathy (3), systemic lupus erythematosus (4),
aplastic anemia (2), neoplasia (2) and T-cell dysfunction (2).
The most common clinical presentation was meningoence-
phalitis (211/374) in immunocompromised and non-mmu-
nocompromised patients (Table 1). The infectious pathogen
was identified in 81% (303/374) of cases, and presumed
viral and bacterial neuroinfections were assumed in 8% (30/
374) and 10.9% (41/374) of patients, respectively.
Virus accounted for 29.4% (110/374) of admissions
(Table 2). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was the
most commonly identified virus with self-limited aseptic
meningoencephalitis during the seroconversion period,
followed closely by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1). Three
non-immunocompromised-patients with HSV1 infection
died as a result of hemorrhagic form despite serial treatment
with acyclovir, intravenous methylprednisolone, pulse
therapy and plasmapheresis. JC virus (JCV) infection
occurred in association with immunodeficiency (one patient
had ovarian cancer and two had AIDS).
Also, 29.4% (110/374) of admissions were as a result of
bacterial infection (Table 3). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was
the main pathogen identified by positive polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) in 82.6% (19/23) of patients and histological
study in the remainder. Another important agent was
Treponema pallidum. Although intravenous penicillin G (24
million/day) had been administered for 21 days, no response
was observed in two patients with progressive general
paresis and only slight improvement occurred in patients
with meningovascular syphilis. PNS involvement was
commonly observed in bacterial infection. Polyradiculitis
was diagnosed in two patients with tuberculosis and
peripheral neuropathy appeared with Mycobacterium leprae
(three), and Bartonella henselae (one) infection.
Parasites comprised 28% (105/374) of neurology ward
(NW) admissions, of which Taenia solium and Schistosoma
mansoni were the most common. Accounting for 64.8% of
parasitic infection, all cases of T. solium presented with
meningoencephalitis in 66 non-immunocompromised and
two immunocompromised patients. Status epilepticus
owing to the degenerating intraparechymatous larval form
of T. solium was the main clinical presentation (n = 55).
Moreover, intraventricular vesicles caused ventriculitis in
three non-immunocompromised patients, two of whom
underwent endoscopic resection and one died. In addition,
two other non-immunocompromised patients developed
hydrocephalus owing to racemous cysts in the spinal cord
with clinical improvement after ventricular drainage. S.
mansoni was identified in 21 (20%) non-immunocompro-
mised patients representing the most important cause of
myelitis (n = 20) in our series; however, one presented with
stroke. Antiparasitic drugs were only used in neurocysti-
cercosis and schistosomiasis when parasitic eggs had been
found in stools or a rectal biopsy. Schistosoma japonicum
caused brain space occupying lesion in one non-immuno-
compromised patient who had just returned from Japan.

(five immunocompromised-patients), Pseudallescheria boydii
(two non-immunocompromised patients, one immunocom-
promised patient), and Aspergillus fumigatus (two immuno-
compromised patients). In addition, Cladophialophora batiana,
Phialophora fonsecae and Chromomycetes accounted with one
non-immunocompromised patient each and Candida sp. and
Rhodotorula sp. with one immunocompromised-patient each.
Particularly, zygomicosis occurred in five diabetic patients
with disseminated cerebral presentation.
Progressive dementia, myoclonus and periodic sharp
wave complexes on electroencephalogram (EEG) were
present in all patients with prion disease (n = 13).
Moreover, clinical and electrophysiological features of
inferior motor neuron disorder were seen in three patients,
and 14.3.3 protein was present in four patients in whom
PCR analysis was carried out.
Considering the clinical outcome, 14.2% (53/374) of
patients died, of whom 62.3% (33/53) were non-immuno-
compromised patients (Table 4). Despite having neurologi-
cal disability at hospital discharge, 82% (307/374) of
patients had improved neurological status (Table 5). All
patients with presumed viral infection (n = 30) and 34% (14/
41) of patients with undetermined bacterial meningitis were
asymptomatic at hospital discharge.
DISCUSSION
In our study, neuroinfection predominated in young
adults and males. Considering similar results published by
Chapp-Jumbo (mean age 34.1 years, 62.9% males) in Africa
and Tan et al. (mean age 42.5 years, 56% males) in North-
America,8,9
these data did not seem to be influenced by
geographical area or quality of health assistance and could
reflect high environmental exposition (recreational and
working activities) of young persons, particularly males.
In comparison to developed countries’ data, our admis-
sion and agent identification rates were closer to the data
series published by Tan et al (3.8% and 68.9%, respectively)
than African teaching infectious disease ward, where
admission rates ranged from 11% to 23% and the identifica-
tion rate was 45%.8,9,10
In addition, the frequency of
undetermined neuroinfection was less than 31% in Tan
et al.9
As reported by these authors, undetermined
neuroinfection was frequently diagnosed in non-immuno-
compromised patients in our series. Indeed, our neuroinfec-
tion mortality was closer to rates in North America that
ranged from 1.7% to 12% than the 47% reported by Chapp-
Jumbo.8,9,11
Analogously to North-American NW results,9
prion and fungi were the more important lethal agents in
our patients. However, a high mortality of fungal infection
was a common finding, not only in North-American, but
also in African studies.8,10,12
In our study, pathogen identification occurred in 81% of
patients, being higher than results reported in developed
countries.9,11
It could possibly be an overestimation as a
result of our inclusion criterion requiring positive agent
identification, which could also explain 100% identification
in parasitic and fungal infections. Another contributing
factor was virus recognition in more than 72% of menin-
goencephalitis cases. According to the literature, virus
identification ranged from 15.3% to 81.5% with the highest
values being observed in industrialized countries.13
Particularly in suspected viral neuroinfection, we follow
the international consensus that recommends repetition of
virological tests in serum and CFS.14
Ordinary agents
causing meningococcal, pneumococcal, streptococcal, sta-
phylococcal and hemophilus meningitis were not observed
in our series possibly as a result of referral bias. For
example, common causes of meningitis could be treated by
the Internal Medicine or Infectious Diseases services of our
hospital whose patients were not included in our study or
could be referred to Hospital Emı´lio Ribas, which is an
infectious diseases center located in same geographical area
as our institution.

Some infectious diseases are commonly associated with
under-development. Considering that more than 90% of
tuberculosis cases in the world are found in developing
countries,15
it is not surprising that neurotuberculosis was the
most frequent bacterial infection in our series. Moreover,
neglected tropical diseases have high morbidity with neuro-
paludism and schistosomiasis being the first and second
identified causes in Africa, respectively.10,16
Similar to these
reports, our series showed a great number of parasitic diseases
in which cysticercosis and schistosomiasis were the main
causes with low mortality and high morbidity. Cysticercosis
has been considered as a biological marker of social and
economic development, an identified cause of epilepsy in
26.3% to 53.8% of patients, and is endemic in most of
developing countries.17,18
In addition, more than 200 million
people have schistosomiasis in tropical countries and 600
million people live in its transmission zones, where the snail
habitat has increased as a result of the implementation of
agriculture and fresh water exposition combined with lack of
sanitary systems.19
Brazil is considered the country most
affected by schistosomiasis in the Americas and takes part in
one of the American developing vaccine programs.20,21
Schistosomiasis has been associated with liver fibrosis, portal
hypertension and hepatosplenomegaly as the more severe
clinical impairments, but our study showed myelitis as
another infection-associated disability. According to
Wadhwa et al,22
C. neoformans was the most common cause
of fungal meningitis in our series. However, some reports
showed other agents, such as Candida albicans in an African
study or aspergillosis and zygomicosis in an Indian patholo-
gical report, in which cryptococcosis accounted for 2% of
histological samples.12,23
Histoplasma capsulatum was the
second more frequent fungus in our cases, possibly because
of its high prevalence in Brazil.24
Also, regional variability in
the fungal aetiological spectrum would possibly be expected
in countries that have continental dimensions with distinct
ecological settings.
CONCLUSION
This retrospective study had methodological limitations
related to scarce epidemiological reports from tropical
countries. Taking into account the characteristics of our
institution, our results did not represent a tropical neuroin-
fection profile but could be considered as a panel commonly
found in other tropical tertiary NW and certainly different
from infectious disease ward admissions at same institution.
Although comparison with literature data could be a matter
of debate owing to differences in health facilities, period and
design of studies, and type of population or ward, it could
be used as a tool to control the quality of health assistance.
