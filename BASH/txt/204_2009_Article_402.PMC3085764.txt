Abstract Benzene is one of the most prominent occupa-
tional and environmental pollutants. The substance is a
proven human carcinogen that induces hematologic
malignancies in humans, probably at even low doses. Yet
knowledge of the mechanisms leading to benzene-induced
carcinogenesis is still incomplete. Benzene itself is not
genotoxic. The generation of carcinogenic metabolites
involves the production of oxidized intermediates such as
catechol, hydroquinone and para-benzoquinone (p-BQ) in
the liver. Further activation to the ultimate carcinogenic
intermediates is most probably catalyzed by myeloperoxi-
dase (MPO). Yet the products of the MPO pathway have
not been identiWed. If an oxidized benzene metabolite
such as p-BQ was actually the precursor for the ultimate
carcinogenic benzene metabolite and further activation
proceeds via MPO mediated reactions, it should be possi-
ble to activate p-BQ to a genotoxic compound in vitro.
We tested this hypothesis with phorbol-12-acetate-13-
myristate (PMA) activated peripheral blood cells exposed
to p-BQ, using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus test.
Addition of 20–28 ng/ml PMA caused a signiWcant
increase of micronuclei at low and non-cytotoxic p-BQ
concentrations between 0.04 and 0.2 g/ml (0.37–
1.85 M). Thus with PMA or p-BQ alone no reproducible
elevation of micronuclei was seen up to toxic concentra-
tions. PMA and p-BQ induce micronuclei when adminis-
tered jointly. Our results add further support to the
hypothesis that MPO is a key enzyme in the activation of
benzene.

Introduction
Benzene [CAS 71-43-2] is widely used as a solvent and an
intermediate in chemical syntheses. In addition, occupa-
tional exposure occurs in oil reWneries and coke oven
plants. Environmental exposure is nearly exclusively
caused by benzene contained in gasoline. Benzene is a
proven human carcinogen probably even at low doses.
Particular concern has been aroused by two independent
studies that showed a possible contribution of environmen-
tal benzene exposure to childhood leukemia (Crosignani
et al. 2004; SteVen et al. 2004). Furthermore, acute hemato-
toxicity in adults can occur at atmospheric concentrations
below 1 ppm benzene (Lan et al. 2004). Despite its
outstanding importance as an ubiquitous, highly toxic

pollutant, knowledge of the mechanisms of benzene toxicity
is still incomplete. Although a variety of eVects on bone
marrow can be demonstrated it is not yet clear that which
metabolites are most important in either benzene-induced
aplastic anemia or leukemia. Benzene metabolism alone is
insuYcient to fully describe benzene toxicity. The impact
of benzene metabolites on bone marrow cells must be fully
explored to determine how benzene exposure can result in
decreased viability or genetic toxicity to cells in the bone
marrow (Snyder 2007). Moreover, the reason for the
observed species diVerences in benzene toxicity between
experimental animals and humans is unclear: whereas
hematopoietic malignancies occur in humans, benzene
produces a variety of tumors in rats and mice (Maltoni et al.
1985; National Toxicology Program 1986). Furthermore, it
is disputed if benzene induces only leukemia in humans
(Lamm et al. 2005; Seidler et al. 2007) or a broader spec-
trum of hematologic malignancies (Hayes et al. 1997;
Mehlman 2004; Smith et al. 2007).
The answers for these open questions are strongly ham-
pered by the complex and not yet fully clariWed metabolism
of benzene. Initially, benzene is oxidized to metabolites
such as 1,2-benzenediol [CAS No. 120-80-9] (catechol),
hydroquinone [CAS 123-31-9] and p-BQ [CAS 106-51-4]
in the liver, primarily by cytochrome P450 2E1. Since ben-
zene does not induce liver tumors and human exposure is
predominantly associated with disorders of the hematopoi-
etic system, it was concluded that myeloperoxidase (MPO)
mediated reactions are involved in the generation of the
ultimate carcinogenic metabolites (Hayes et al. 1997; Smith
et al. 2007; Environmental Protection Agency USA 1998).
Actually, benzene causes malignancies in experimental ani-
mals preferentially in peroxidase rich tissues (Maltoni et al.
1985; National Toxicology Program 1986).
Benzene-induced oxidative DNA damage is enhanced in
PMA-stimulated cells in vitro and in LPS-treated animals
(Tuo et al. 1999). Consequently it was proposed that “per-
oxidatic metabolism of benzene’s phenolic metabolites
may be responsible for the increased free radical activity
and toxicity produced by benzene in bone marrow, and that
free radicals contribute, at least in part, to the toxic and
leukemogenic eVects of benzene” (Subrahmanyam et al.
1991). However, direct evidence for MPO mediated gener-
ation of genotoxic metabolites does not exist and benzene
adducts which were detected in humans and experimental
animals could not be identiWed (Bechtold et al. 1992;
Krewet et al. 1993; McDonald et al. 1994; Creek et al.
1997).
Human MPO is expressed at high levels in the bone mar-
row and in peripheral blood cells such as neutrophils and
monocytes. The enzyme is stored in “large dense azurophil
granules” (Bainton et al. 1971) and is released during host
defence and inXammatory reactions, parallel to the genera-
tion of H2O2 and HOCl. MPO activation can be experimen-
tally induced by PMA (phorbol-12-acetate-13-myristate) or
LPS (bacterial lipopolysaccharide). MPO is proposed to
play a major role in the generation of tissue damage caused
by chronic inXammation (Winterbourn 2002). Reactions
accompanying MPO activation are suggested to take part in
the toxiWcation of oxidizable substances (Winterbourn
2002; Trush 1984; Eastmond and Smith 1990) or may act
as co-factor in chemical carcinogenesis (Coussens and
Werb 2002).
Benzene is one of the few strong carcinogens that yield
negative results in in vitro mutagenicity tests (Zarani et al.
1999), whereas genotoxic eVects are observed in vivo
(Tweats et al. 2007). In addition, genotoxicity of benzene
metabolites such as hydroquinone, catechol and p-BQ is
absent or weak at toxic concentrations (Ludewig et al.
1989; Yager et al. 1990; Lévay and Bodell 1992). This
most probably reXects the inability of in vitro systems to
model a complex metabolism and interactions of diVerent
metabolizing compartments.
However, if an intermediate such as p-BQ is actually the
precursor for the ultimate carcinogenic benzene metabolite
and further activation proceeds via MPO mediated reac-
tions, it should be possible to activate p-BQ to a genotoxic
compound in vitro. Since benzene exposure leads to clasto-
genic eVects (Smith et al. 2007; Tough et al. 1970; Forni
1971; Picciano 1979; Popp et al. 1992; Tompa et al. 1994;
Rothman et al. 1995, 1996; Smith et al. 1998; Zhang et al.
1998, 2005), micronuclei should be suitable endpoints to
monitor such eVects.
Treatment of HL-60 cells with 3 M p-BQ caused a
threefold reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cell
proliferation and prolonged phosphorylation of ERK1/2
proteins. Catalase or the MEK protein inhibitor PD98059
reduced cell recruitment into the S-phase and ERK1/2
protein phosphorylation. Thus, p-BQ is able to induce
ROS and cell proliferation. This would theoretically
enhance the vulnerability of the exposed cells (Ruiz-Ramos
et al. 2005).
Therefore, we proposed that the combination of p-BQ
and PMA might be especially eVective to investigate p-BQ
activation by PMA and investigated if p-BQ can be
activated by MPO mediated reactions by using the cytoki-
nesis-block micronucleus technique and PMA activated
peripheral human blood mononuclear cells.

Micronucleus test
The cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay was carried out
according to Fenech (1993) using primary human lymphocytes
from three diVerent donors (donor 1 was a 45-year-old
male smoker; donor 2 a 47-year-old female non-smoker
and donor 3 a 38-year-old male non-smoker). Blood was
collected by venipuncture in Sodium-heparin tubes
(Sarstedt AG & Co, Nümbrecht, Germany), diluted 1:1 in
phosphate buVered saline (PBS) and separated by a
FICOLL gradient (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany) for
isolation of lymphocytes. Approximately 1.2 £ 106
cells
were seeded in 2.5 ml RPMI medium each (ICN, Eschwege,
Germany) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS)
(Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany). Lymphocytes were
stimulated by adding 5 g/ml phytohemagglutinin (Bio-
chrom KG, Berlin, Germany) and cultivated at 37°C,
100% humidity and 5% CO2 for 70 h. PMA and p-BQ
were added simultaneously 24 after having started the
cultures. Cell division was blocked 44 h after starting the
cultures by adding 4.5 g/ml cytochalasin-B (Sigma-
Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany).
Without addition of PMA, up to 5 g/ml p-BQ (mini-
mum 97% purity, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany)
were applied to the cultures (2.5 ml). Co-incubation with
PMA was initially done using 24–80 ng PMA and up to
1 g/ml p-BQ. PMA was processed as follows: PMA was
dissolved in DMSO (1 mg/ml) and stored in 10 l aliquots
at ¡18°C. Prior to the addition to the cultures PMA was
mixed with 990 l medium. Mitomycin C (Sigma-Aldrich)
served as positive control. One sample without addition of
p-BQ and PMA served as negative control as did another
sample with addition of PMA only.
Lymphocytes were sampled 68 h after having started the
cultures and 28 h after addition of cytochalasin-B by centri-
fugation for 5 min at 175£g and 20°C. Hypotonic treat-
ment was performed by careful resuspension of the cells in
5 ml hypotonic saline (0.07 M KCl/0.15 M NaCl). Cells
were collected for 5 min at 175£g and 20°C immediately
after the addition of hypotonic solution. The cell pellet was
resuspended in 3 ml ice cold methanol/acetic acid (4:1).
Cell Wxation was performed twice. Finally the cells were
pelleted for 5 min at 4°C and 175£g and transferred onto
ice cold degreased slides. The slides were randomized and
subsequently stained with 3% Giemsa R66 ‘Gurr’ (BDH,
Promochem GmbH, Wesel, Germany) for 7 min.
Six independent experiments were performed for donor
1 and four experiments each for donors 2 and 3. For each
experiment blood was freshly collected and each single
experiment was done on a diVerent date. At least Wve con-
centrations were examined. Cell viability was determined
by trypan blue exclusion test (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)
and additionally by evaluation of the nuclear division index
(NDI, Eastmond and Tucker 1989). Cell scoring was
done according to the criteria outlined by Fenech (1993).
Binucleated cells and cells not containing more than four
micronuclei with preserved cytoplasm were counted.
Additional acceptance criteria for a genotoxic eVect
were: positive- and solvent control within the historical
range, signiWcantly elevated frequency of micronuclei
exceeding the respective control (0 g/ml p-BQ with or
without PMA) at non-toxic concentrations and unchanged
pH. More than one succeeding concentration yielding total
cell counts below 1,000 binucleated cells, a NDI < 1.4 and
viability below 60% were regarded as toxic.
Statistics
The micronucleus rates of selected experiments were com-
pared to the rates of negative controls with PMA and with-
out p-BQ, and additionally to the rates of negative controls
without PMA and without p-BQ using Fisher’s exact test.
The Cochrane-Armitage test was applied to selected dose
samples to test positive trends. SAS 9.2 software was used
for all calculations (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
Results
The concentration range for the tests was initially deter-
mined using between 24 and 80 ng/ml PMA in combination
with up to 8.0 g/ml p-BQ. At and above 32 ng/ml PMA
(70 ng/2.5 ml medium) toxicity and strong variations of the
eVects occurred (data not shown). In single concentration
range Wnding experiments PMA concentrations at and
above 32 ng/ml caused a signiWcant increase of micronuclei
(example shown in Table 1, experiment 2). However, these
eVects were poorly reproducible and most probably attrib-
utable to toxicity.
In some concentration range Wnding experiments signiW-
cantly elevated micronuclei counts occurred with addition
of p-BQ alone at and above 4 g/ml (example shown in
Table 1, experiment 11). Yet these eVects were as well
poorly reproducible and attributable to toxicity.
In single concentration range Wnding experiments in
which PMA concentrations at and above 32 ng/ml were
used, elevation of micronuclei showed a bimodal distribu-
tion. This appeared without noticeable eVects on the NDI.
In case of bimodal distribution of elevated micronuclei,
the second elevation occurred at about 60% cytotoxicity
(example shown in Table 1, experiments 1 and 2). In
another set of experiments weak PMA genotoxicity
occurred and the combination with p-BQ yielded a strong
synergistic elevation of micronuclei.
With the aim to improve reproducibility, we performed
a more detailed analysis of the p-BQ concentration range

by applying 20–28 ng/ml (0.37–1.85 M) PMA. Under
these conditions, a signiWcant increase of micronuclei
occurred between 0.04 and 0.2 g p-BQ: In 4 out of 11
experiments using 20–28 ng/ml PMA, signiWcance was
reached in terms of a positive trend test (experiments 7, 9,
12 and 14). In six experiments (experiments 1, 3, 4, 5, 6
and 8) at least one concentration yielded a signiWcant
elevation of micronuclei compared to the control with
addition of PMA. In two experiments (experiments 7 and
12) signiWcant elevated micronuclei occurred in combina-
tion with a positive trend test and in two experiments with
addition of 20 ng/ml PMA neither a positive trend test nor
a signiWcant elevation was seen (experiments 10 and 13).
Viability—according to the trypane exclusion test—con-
stituted 70–90% and only minor changes in the NDI were
seen (Table 1).

Discussion
Central questions concerning benzene toxicity are still
unanswered: why is benzene such a potent carcinogen
whereas compounds with a similar chemical structure such
as phenol, hydroquinone or p-BQ are not (although they are
metabolites of benzene)? Does benzene cause the formation
of mutagenic DNA-adducts or rather act by a clastogenic
eVect? Why are only hematopoietic malignancies seen in
humans whereas a broader tumor spectrum occurs in exper-
imental animals? Are only myeloic stem cells targets of
benzene toxicity in humans? Since no convincing evidence
for genotoxic eVects of p-BQ, phenol, 1,2-benzenediol or
hydroquinone exists, do other benzene metabolites contrib-
ute to benzene carcinogenicity instead? An appropriate in
vitro system could help to answer these open questions.
We observed a signiWcant elevation of micronuclei at
very low, non-cytotoxic concentrations between 0.04 and
0.2 g/ml p-BQ using PMA activated peripheral blood
cells. This is the Wrst report that shows genotoxic eVects of
p-BQ in peripheral blood cells at non-toxic concentrations
and the Wrst direct evidence for in vitro activation of a ben-
zene metabolite by PMA inducible reactions. Notably, we
achieved positive results at very low p-BQ concentrations
between 0.37 and 1.85 M, whereas in formerly published
investigations p-BQ alone induced an elevation of micronu-
clei only at toxic concentrations above 35 M in V79 cells
(Ludewig et al. 1989) and at and above 2.5 M in human
lymphocytes (Yager et al. 1990). Treatment of HL-60 cells
with cytotoxic concentrations of 500 M hydroquinone and
250 M 1,2,4,-benzenetriole resulted in the formation of a
single DNA adduct in HL-60 cells which was detected by
32
P-postlabelling. We could not reproduce former positive
results using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus technique,
human lymphocytes and up to 46.3 M p-BQ without addi-
tion of PMA. Only addition of PMA at relatively low con-
centrations resulted in reproducible p-BQ genotoxicity.
These eVects occurred at a narrow concentration range
between 20 and 28 ng PMA. Toxicity at and above 32 ng/ml
PMA masked genotoxic eVects of p-BQ; whereas addition
of less than 24 ng/ml PMA yielded only weak eVects.
Cytotoxic artifacts are often misinterpreted as genotoxic
eVects when using in vitro assays and eukaryotic cells
(Kirkland et al. 2007). The in vitro micronucleus test how-
ever allows the parallel investigation of the nuclear division
index or the mitotic index to monitor cytotoxicity, and eval-
uation of binucleated (vital) cells can avoid the inclusion of
damaged cells (Fenech 1993). Admittedly in our experi-
ments concentrations at and above 32 ng/ml PMA yielded
inconclusive results and poor reproducibility, even at con-
centrations which did not appreciably aVect the NDI. Some
of these experiments showed a bimodal elevation of micro-
nuclei, Wrst between 0.04–0.2 g/ml p-BQ and 28–32 ng/ml
PMA; second at and above 0.4 g/ml p-BQ and, according
to the typane blue exclusion test, at about 60% cytotoxicity
(Table 1). This second elevation might be caused by cyto-
toxic artefacts.
Acceptance criteria for a positive in vitro micronucleus
test are not consistently used. A previous publication of the
“Gesellschaft für Umwelt-Mutationsforschung” deWned a
dose–eVect relationship as follows: if there were at least
two consecutive concentrations having increased aberration
frequencies and the eVect of the higher concentration was
more pronounced than that of the lower, this was regarded
as dose–eVect relationship. A doubling over control was not
necessarily considered adequate by itself (Miller et al.
1998). According to a more recent publication a dose-
related increase in micronuclei frequencies (e.g. trend test)
which exceeds statistically signiWcantly the upper limit of
the historical and concurrent negative control (chi-square or
Fisher’s exact test) or at least a twofold increase over mean
control micronuclei frequencies are required for a positive
call. If a chemical meets all these criteria, it is proposed to
be considered clearly positive. If a chemical satisWes none
of these criteria, it should be considered clearly negative
(Corvi et al. 2008).
In 2 out of 11 of our experiments in which 20 and 28 ng/ml
PMA were applied, we achieved a signiWcant dose–
response according to the Cochrane-Armitage test and a
statistically signiWcant deviation from the concurrent nega-
tive control according to the Fisher’s exact test. Two exper-
iments were clearly negative, in both we had applied 20 ng/
ml PMA. Accordingly the minimal eVective PMA dose
concerning p-BQ activation was between 20 and 24 ng/ml
PMA. The remaining experiments showed a signiWcant ele-
vation according to a positive trend test or a positive
Fisher’s exact test.
The concentration range for a genotoxic eVect is very
narrow, most probably because the dose–response could be
inXuenced by cytotoxic eVects of both PMA and p-BQ. In
addition, the concentration range can vary from donor to
donor and test to test because the amount of inducible cells
may be diVerent and the PMA response may be modiWed by
genetic- or life style factors. In fact, donor 1 showed the
strongest variations in the results and a dose–response rela-
tionship could not be established. Interestingly donor 1 was
the only smoker. However, we did not systematically eval-
uate a possible smoking eVect on the results.
Phorbol-12-acetate-13-myristate induced peripheral
blood cells are routinely used as a model for the investiga-
tion of inXammation and might enable the investigation of
the role of inXammation in chemically induced carcinogen-
esis (Eastmond and Smith 1990). PMA induces oxidative
bursts (Walrand et al. 2003) and oxidative DNA damage
(Dzarlieva-Petrusevska and Füsenig 1985; Petrusevska
et al. 1988). An inXuence of PMA on the generation of
728 Arch Toxicol (2009) 83:721–729
123
benzene-induced oxidative DNA damage in rats was shown
(Subrahmanyam et al. 1991). Toxic eVects of PMA are
mediated by MPO induction. MPO and other peroxidases
catalyze the generation of hypochloric acid from H2O2 and
Cl¡
(Aucherè and Capeillère-Blandin 1999), reactions of
phenolic compounds (Eastmond et al. 1986) and 1,2-ben-
zenediol to highly reactive intermediates. The binding of
1,2-benzenediol peroxidation products to N-7 guanine and
N-3 adenine results in DNA depurination (Cavalieri et al.
2002). Accordingly, benzene-induced oxidative DNA dam-
age is enhanced in PMA-stimulated cells in vitro and in
LPS-treated animals (Tuo et al. 1999). Altogether evidence
points towards peroxidase mediated benzene toxicity.
Physiologically MPO is released during host defence
and inXammatory reactions, parallel to the generation of
H2O2. The enzyme was proposed to be involved in the gen-
eration of tissue damage caused by chronic inXammation
(Winterbourn 2002). Reactions accompanying MPO activa-
tion were suggested to take part in the toxiWcation of oxy-
gen reactive substances (Winterbourn 2002; Trush 1984;
Eastmond and Smith 1990) or to act as co-factor in chemi-
cal carcinogenesis (Coussens and Werb 2002). Activation
of p-BQ via PMA-induced reactions which is shown in our
experiments, may provide an experimental approach to test
this hypothesis in vitro. Furthermore our results will enable
the comparative investigation of other benzene metabolites
such as HQ or catechol.
In conclusion, p-BQ can be activated to genotoxic inter-
mediates when administered jointly with PMA. Our results
conWrm the hypothesis that MPO is a key enzyme in the
activation of benzene.
