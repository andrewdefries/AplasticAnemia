Abstract
Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an inducible heme-degrading
enzyme, is expressed by macrophages and endothelial cells in
response to various stresses. Because ferritin synthesis is
stimulated by Fe2+, which is a product of heme degradation, we
examined the relation between HO-1 and ferritin levels in the
serum of patients with hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS), adult-
onset Still's disease (ASD), and other diseases that may cause
hyperferritinemia. Seven patients with HPS, 10 with ASD, 73
with other rheumatic diseases, 20 with liver diseases, 10
recipients of repeated blood transfusion because of
hematological disorders, and 22 healthy volunteers were
enrolled. Serum HO-1 and ferritin levels were determined by
ELISA. Expression of HO-1 mRNA and protein by peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was determined by real-time
PCR and immunocytochemical techniques, respectively. Serum
levels of HO-1 were significantly higher in patients with active
HPS and ASD than in the other groups (P < 0.01). HO-1 levels
were not elevated in patients with other causes of
hyperferritinemia but were moderately elevated in patients with
dermatomyositis/polymyositis. Among patients with HPS and
ASD, serum HO-1 levels correlated closely with serum ferritin
levels, and the levels of both returned to normal after therapy had
induced remission. Increased expression of HO-1 mRNA was
confirmed in PBMCs from some patients with HPS and ASD.
Hyperferritinemia correlated closely with increased serum HO-1
in patients with HPS and ASD but not other conditions,
indicating that measurement of serum HO-1 and ferritin levels
would be useful in the differential diagnosis of hyperferritinemia
and perhaps also in monitoring disease activity in HPS and
ASD.
Introduction
Heme oxygenase (HO) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conver-
sion of heme into CO, Fe2+, and biliverdin [1,2]. HO-1, an
inducible form of HO, is a 32-kD heat shock protein expressed
in response to various noxious stimuli including heavy metals,
hyperoxia, hypoxia, endotoxin, hydrogen peroxide, and inflam-
matory cytokines [1,2]. Evidence suggests that increased
expression of HO-1 can benefit the host in a variety of patho-
logical conditions [1-5]. In this context, our research team has
found that HO-1 gene therapy is useful for lipopolysaccharide-
induced lung injury [6], influenza viral pneumonia [7], bleomy-
cin-induced pulmonary fibrosis [8], and chronic respiratory
infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice [9]. We also
found that chemically induced HO-1 was of benefit in lupus
nephritis [10]. On the other hand, a deficiency in HO-1 expres-
sion is associated with severe chronic inflammation, as shown
in studies of HO-1 knockout mice (mice in which the gene for
HO-1 had been inactivated) and a patient with HO-1 defi-
ciency [11-13]. This observation is consistent with HO-1 hav-
ing a physiological effect in protecting against inflammation.

Products of heme degradation mediate the protective effects
of HO-1. CO suppresses apoptosis, macrophage activation,
and the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, nitrite oxide,
and prostaglandins [1,2,14]. Biliverdin is converted into
bilirubin, an antioxidant [1,2,15-18]. Fe2+, which itself has toxic
effects by inducing the formation of free radicals, stimulates
the production of ferritin [19]. Ferritin acts as an antioxidant
and detoxifies Fe2+ [19]. Thus, the heme degradation products
and the metabolic derivatives generated by HO-1 suppress
toxic events in cells.
Regulation of HO-1 is of particular interest in the inflammation
associated with hyperferritinemia, as is the case in hemo-
phagocytic syndrome (HPS) and adult-onset Still's disease
(ASD), because HO-1 can be involved in increased ferritin in
these conditions [1,2]. HPS is a serious, life-threatening con-
dition, which is characterized by cytopenia due to hemophago-
cytosis [20-22]. The disease is subdivided into two
categories, familial lymphohistiocytosis and secondary HPS,
the latter of which is associated with rheumatic diseases such
as systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, viral infection,
and certain malignancies [20].
Like children with Still's disease, patients with ASD present
with high fever, arthralgia, typical skin rash, hepatosplenomeg-
aly, and leukocytosis [20,21]. HPS and ASD share several
clinical features, including high fever, hepatosplenomegaly,
lymphadenopathy, liver injury, and coagulopathy [20,21]. The
observation that severe ASD is sometimes complicated by
HPS is consistent with the suggestion that a common patho-
physiology may link these two diseases [20,21,23].
Recent studies have shown that dysfunction of natural killer
(NK) cells due to mutations of the genes for perforin and Munc
13-4 leads to familial lymphohistiocytosis, whereas it has been
suggested that decreased NK cell activity and abnormal levels
of perforin are involved in the macrophage activation syndrome
of systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis [20]. Dysfunc-
tion of NK and cytotoxic cells may lead to inadequate control
of cellular immune responses, resulting in systemic macro-
phage activation, which is implicated in the development of
both diseases of HPS and ASD. Subsequently, excessive pro-
duction of proinflammatory cytokines and active infiltration of
macrophages into vital organs have been observed [20,21].
Increased serum ferritin is characteristic of, but not specific
for, both diseases, because it is also elevated in various other
conditions [23,24]. For example, patients with hyperferritine-
mia who have rheumatic or liver disease or who receive fre-
quent transfusions because of hematological diseases often
develop cytopenia and high fever resembling these signs in
HPS.
Lack of specific disease markers often delays diagnosis of
HPS and ASD, with potentially lethal consequences [21]. The
present study shows that serum HO-1 levels are significantly
increased in patients with active HPS and ASD but not in
patients with hyperferritinemia due to other causes. Moreover,
there is a close correlation between serum HO-1 levels and
the disease activity in HPS and ASD.
Materials and methods
Patients
All patients enrolled in this study were being treated at the
Yokohama City University Hospital, the Yokohama City Univer-
sity Medical Center Hospital, or the National Hospital Organi-
zation Yokohama Medical Center (Table 1). Seven patients
with secondary HPS met the diagnostic guideline for hemo-
phagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [22,25], except as regards
hypertriglyceridemia and hypofibrinogenemia, neither of which
is generally applicable to secondary HPS in adults. In these
seven patients, the underlying diseases were systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) in two; hematological malignancy,
including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and
acute myeloid leukemia, in three; and ASD and viral infection
in the others. The patients having more than two lineages of
cytopenia, liver dysfunction, fever above 39°C, and hyperfer-
ritinemia were categorized as having active disease. Remis-
sion of the diseases was defined as disappearance of these
findings after therapy. Ten patients with ASD met the criteria
of Cush [26] and Yamaguchi [27] and their colleagues. An
ASD patient who also met the diagnostic guidelines for hemo-
phagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was classified in the HPS
group in this study. Patients with active ASD were those pre-
senting with polyarthritis, typical skin rashes, and fever above
39°C, in addition to hyperferritinemia. When the symptoms
and signs had subsided, the patients were considered to be in
remission.
We also studied 73 patients with other rheumatic diseases,
including 30 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 18 with SLE, 9
with dermatomyositis/polymyositis (DM/PM), and 16 with
Behçet's disease (BD). The diagnosis of individual diseases
was based on the following criteria: for RA, the 1987 Ameri-
can College of Rheumatology (formerly, the American Rheu-
matism Association) criteria [28]; for SLE, the 1997 updating
of the American College of Rheumatology revised criteria for
the classification of systemic lupus erythematosus [29]; for
polymyositis and dermatomyositis, the diagnostic criteria
described by Bohan and Peter [30,31]; and for Behçet's dis-
ease, the International Study Group criteria for diagnosis of
Behçet's disease [32]. The disease activity was evaluated at
the time of blood sampling. All of the RA patients were consid-
ered to have active disease, because their disease activity
scores (DAS) based on 28 joints and C-reactive protein (CRP)
(DAS28-CRP) were more than 3.2 [33]. The mean CRP level
at the time of blood sampling was 2.4 ± 2.7 mg/dl. On the
basis of the Systemic Lupus Disease Activity Index [34], 12 of
the 18 SLE patients had a score above 9 and were regarded
as having active disease, while the other 6 were in remission.
Two other SLE patients who met the diagnostic guidelines for
Available online http://arthritis-research.com/content/7/3/R616
R618
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis were included in the
HPS group [22,25]. All of the DM/PM patients had active dis-
eases, inasmuch as their creatine kinase concentrations were
more than twice the normal upper limit and they had muscle
weakness and/or active interstitial pneumonia. Six of the 16
BD patients presented active symptoms of uveitis, erythema
nodosum, genital ulcers, deep vein thrombus, central nervous
system involvement, arterial occlusion, or gastrointestinal
lesions in addition to positive CRP, indicating active disease;
the other 10 were regarded as having inactive disease.
Twenty patients with liver diseases were enrolled in this study
(Table 1). Of the five with acute hepatitis, three had hepatitis
B, one had drug-induced hepatitis, and one had Epstein–Barr
viral hepatitis. The seven patients with chronic hepatitis
included one with hepatitis B and six with hepatitis C. Serum
alanine aminotransferase levels were measured as an indicator
of liver injury. The means ± standard deviations (IU/l) found for
these 20 patients were as follows: acute hepatitis, 770.0 ±
568.6; chronic hepatitis, 61.9 ± 28.9; liver cirrhosis, 59.0 ±
24.0; hepatocellular carcinoma, 27.5 ± 14.8; primary biliary
cirrhosis, 98.5 ± 14.1; autoimmune hepatitis, 259; and alco-
holic hepatitis, 56.
Ten patients who had received frequent blood transfusions
were also included. The underlying hematological diseases
were myelodysplastic syndrome in six patients and aplastic
anemia in four. Healthy volunteers served as normal controls.
All the studies were performed after obtaining written informed
consent, which was approved by the local Institutional Review
Board.
ELISA
Serum ferritin and HO-1 levels were measured by an EIA
detection system (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan), and a human HO-1
ELISA kit (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada), respectively. Concen-
trations of serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were deter-
mined by specific ELISA systems using pairs of capture and
biotin-conjugated detecting antibodies, which were pur-
chased from R&D (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Serum IL-18 level

was determined using a human IL-18 ELISA kit in accordance
with the manufacturer's protocol (MBL, Nagoya, Japan).
Cell preparation and culture
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by
centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque (ICN, Aurora, OH, USA).
106cells/ml were cultured with 100 µM hemin (Sigma-Aldrich,
Saint Louis, MO, USA) in Hepes modified RPMI 1640 (Sigma-
Aldrich) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Equitech-Bio, Kerr-
ville, TX, USA), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 U/ml
penicillin, plus 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) in a
5% CO2 in an air incubator at 37°C for 24 hours.
Real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cells by using TRIzol reagent (Inv-
itrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Reverse transcription was per-
formed using a SuperScript™ reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen). Panels of primers of human HO-1 and glyceralde-
hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA were pur-
chased from PE Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA).
Real-time PCR was performed using a TaqMan Universal Mas-
ter Mix (PE Applied Biosystems), and the data were analyzed
by the ABI prism 7700 sequence detection system (PE
Applied Biosystems). Briefly, 1/50 amounts of of cDNA
derived from 1 µg of total RNA, 200 nmol/l of probe, and 800
nmol/l of primers were incubated in 25 µl at 50°C for 2min and
95°C for 10min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15s and
60°C for 1 min. The amounts of cDNA obtained from transcrip-
tions of mRNA were semiquantified in comparison with those
of serially diluted standard cDNA, which was prepared using
a conventional PCR technique. The expression level of HO-1
mRNA in a sample was expressed as arbitrary units, which
were determined by the formula 1AU = (HO-1 mRNA/GAPDH
mRNA) × 100.
Immunocytochemistry
Cells expressing HO-1 were determined with anti-HO-1 mon-
oclonal antibody (Stressgen) using a Dako LSAB2 kit (Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark).
Statistical analysis
The Mann–Whitney U test, the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and
multiple regression analyses were used to test for differences.
P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Values
are reported as means ± standard deviations.
Results
Increased serum HO-1 levels in patients with HPS and
ASD
Serum HO-1 levels in patients with inflammatory rheumatic
diseases were monitored by ELISA. In the healthy controls,
only very low levels of serum HO-1 were detectable (2.6 ± 1.3
ng/ml) (Fig. 1). Age and sex did not influence HO-1 levels. In
contrast, HO-1 levels were significantly elevated in patients
with active ASD and HPS (Table 1; Fig. 1). HO-1 protein lev-
els exceeded 10 ng/ml in all but one patient with ASD, who
was classified as having active disease in the study because
of high fever with elevated levels of CRP and ferritin during
maintenance therapy with a low dose of prednisolone (PSL).
However, the clinical manifestations were less serious and
serum ferritin was lower (1201 ng/ml) than in any other patient
with active ASD in this study. Although subjects with active
DM/PM also had significantly increased serum HO-1 levels
(Table 1; P = 0.001), these were still significantly lower than
in subjects with active HPS or ADS (P = 0.0007 and P =
0.003, respectively). Serum HO-1 levels were not increased in
other rheumatic diseases including RA, SLE, and BD, regard-
less of disease activity (except for two patients with SLE com-
plicated by HPS) (Table 1). These findings suggest that
increased serum HO-1 levels are characteristic of active ASD
and HPS.
Serum HO-1 is a marker of disease severity in HPS and
ASD
Serum HO-1 levels were monitored before and after remis-
sion-inducing therapy that included corticosteroids with or
without cyclosporin A in three patients with HPS and five with
ASD. Serum HO-1 levels were significantly reduced after suc-
cessful therapy (Fig. 2a) (P = 0.0078).

Serum HO-1 and ferritin were serially monitored in one patient
with ASD and one with HPS during the course of disease (Fig.
2b,c). A 34-year-old man admitted with fever, polyarthralgia,
sore throat, and salmon-pink rashes was diagnosed with ASD
(Fig. 2b). When this patient was admitted, his serum concen-
trations of both HO-1 and ferritin were extremely elevated
(182 ng/ml and 6,855 ng/ml, respectively). Treatment with
methylprednisolone (mPSL) pulse therapy (1,000 mg/day for
3 days) followed by oral PSL (60 mg/day) and cyclosporin A
(200 mg/day) led to clinical remission. Associated with this
response to therapy, serum HO-1 levels gradually decreased
to the normal range over 2 months, as did levels of ferritin and
CRP. PSL was tapered to 30 mg/day without relapse.
In a 45-year-old woman with SLE admitted with high fever and
cytopenia (Fig. 2c), bone marrow aspiration revealed hemo-
phagocytosis, and her serum ferritin level was 4,588 ng/ml,
resulting in a diagnosis of HPS complicated with SLE (the
Systemic Lupus Disease Activity Index score was 9). On
admission, increased serum HO-1 (74.8 ng/ml) was noted.
mPSL pulse therapy (1,000 mg/day for 3 days) followed by
oral PSL (60 mg/day) and intravenous gamma globulin (17.5
g/day for 5 days) temporarily reduced her fever and CRP lev-
els. Despite these treatments, serum ferritin and HO-1 peaked
at 25,070 ng/ml and 214 ng/ml, respectively. A second
course of mPSL pulse therapy also failed, but the patient's
condition gradually improved after initiation of cyclosporin A
(200 mg/day). Serum levels of CRP, ferritin, and HO-1
reached normal levels by two months after admission. PSL
was tapered to 30 mg/day without exacerbation. These
findings suggest that the serum HO-1 level is closely corre-
lated with disease activity during the clinical course in patients
with HPS and ASD.
We next examined the relation between the serum HO-1 level
and other laboratory parameters in the patients with HPS and
ASD. Because serum ferritin was widely accepted as a moni-
toring marker for the diseases, the data included in the analysis
were those found when the ferritin level was highest in individ-
ual patients during the whole study. The results indicate that
serum HO-1 correlates closely with serum ferritin (P = 0.0048,
Fig. 3a) but not CRP or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels
(Fig. 3b,c), a finding consistent with an association between
HO-1 and hyperferritinemia in patients with HPS and ASD.
We also measured serum levels of IL-18 and TNF-α, both of
which have been shown to be elevated in patients with HPS

and ASD [35,36]. However, we did not find any correlation
between serum level of HO-1 and those of cytokines (data not
shown).
Increased serum HO-1 level is not always associated
with hyperferritinemia
Besides being found in patients with HPS and ASD, hyperfer-
ritinemia is also found in patients with liver diseases and in
recipients of frequent blood transfusions. Because ferritin syn-
thesis is stimulated by Fe2+, which is generated by HO-1-
mediated heme degradation, hyperferritinemia might be
caused by high HO-1 activity, irrespective of the underlying
diseases. To examine this possibility, the relation between
serum HO-1 and ferritin was evaluated in all patient groups. A
total of 37 patients had serum ferritin levels >500 ng/ml, which
is the cutoff level in the revised diagnostic criteria for HLH
[22,25]. Serum HO-1 levels exceeded 10 ng/ml in 7 of 7 HPS
patients and in 9 of 10 ASD patients but in only 2 of 20
patients with other diseases (one with dermatomyositis and
the other with Epstein–Barr hepatitis) (Fig. 4). Of all the sub-
jects studied, only one person, with dermatomyositis, had
serum HO-1 >10 ng/ml but serum ferritin <500 ng/ml. Thus,
simultaneous elevation of serum ferritin and HO-1 was much
more common in patients with ASD and HPS than any other
disease studied.
HO-1 is up-regulated in PBMCs from some, but not all,
patients with active HPS and ASD
Yachie and colleagues reported that PBMCs from children
with acute inflammatory illness express elevated HO-1 mRNA
levels [37]. In our study, HO-1 mRNA expression in PBMCs
was semiquantified using real-time PCR. We found that
PBMCs from 3 of 5 patients with active HPS and 3 of 10 with
active ASD had HO-1 mRNA expression exceeding the mean
+ 2 standard deviations of healthy controls, whereas no such
elevations were found in PBMCs from patients with other
rheumatic diseases, irrespective of disease activity (Fig. 5a).
The six patients with increased mRNA expression universally
manifested elevated serum HO-1 protein levels. Moreover,
HO-1 mRNA expression fell when remission was induced in
two patients with HPS and one with ASD (Fig. 5b). Changes
in HO-1 mRNA expression mirrored changes in serum HO-1
protein levels in a 45-year-old woman (Fig. 5c). This patient,
who had had ASD for 4 years and maintained remission with
PSL (20 mg/day), was admitted to our hospital because of
high fever and cytopenia. Bone marrow aspiration revealed
hemophagocytosis, indicating that the patient's ASD was
complicated with HPS. Besides increased serum ferritin
(8,690 ng/ml) and HO-1 (40.4 ng/ml), HO-1 mRNA expres-
sion in PBMCs was much higher than that of healthy controls.
Immunocytochemistry showed that HO-1-expressing cells
were found in hemin-treated, but not untreated, PBMCs from
normal donors (Fig. 6a,b), whereas HO-1 proteins were
stained in freshly isolated PBMCs, mainly monocytes, from the
patient (Fig. 6c). After clinical remission was achieved by
mPSL pulse therapy and subsequent oral PSL, HO-1 mRNA
in PBMCs was reduced in parallel with serum HO-1 and ferri-
tin levels (Fig. 5c). These data indicate that circulating PBMCs
may contribute to increased serum HO-1 protein levels in
some subjects. However, since HO-1 mRNA expression was
normal in PBMCs from 9 of 15 patients with active HPS and
ASD, despite elevated serum HO-1, it is clear that PBMCs are
not a critical source of circulating HO-1.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that serum HO-1 levels are elevated
in patients with active HPS and ASD, and that these levels
correlate closely with disease activity, irrespective of underly-
ing conditions and clinical phenotypes. Serum HO-1 levels
were also slightly elevated in some patients with DM/PM, but
not to the degree of patients with HPS or ASD.
Yachie and colleagues reported that HO-1 mRNA levels were
elevated in PBMCs from children with acute inflammatory ill-
ness and suggested that HO-1 is up-regulated when cells are
stressed [37]. It has been shown that HO-1 is cytoprotective
in a number of pathological conditions [1,2], although an
excess of HO-1 can also injure cells [38-40]. In the current
study, increased serum HO-1 was present only in patients with
active disease, although it is unclear whether HO-1 was play-
ing a protective or harmful role in these subjects.

Very high levels of serum ferritin are widely used as a marker
for HPS and ASD [20,21,23], although the mechanism under-
lying this increase in ferritin is unknown. The current work doc-
uments a significant correlation between serum HO-1 and
ferritin levels in HPS and ASD patients. Increased HO-1 activ-
ity generates Fe2+, a heme catabolyzed product of HO-1,
which acts as a potent stimulator of ferritin synthesis [19].
Indeed, it has been shown that more Fe2+ is sequestered by
ferritin in ASD patients than in healthy controls, whereas the
iron saturation of individual ferritin molecules was decreased
[41]. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that
increased HO-1 contributes to hyperferritinemia in ASD and
HPS. Alternatively, because Nrf2 (nuclear factor, erythroid
derived 2, like 2) regulates transcription of HO-1 and ferritin
genes, activation of the transcription factor may be involved in
simultaneous overproduction of both molecules [42,43]. On
the other hand, it is plausible that an HO-1-independent or an
Nrf2-independent mechanism or both are responsible for the
elevation in serum ferritin level in subjects with liver disease
and frequent transfusions.
Sources of circulating HO-1 in patients with HPS and ASD
remain undetermined. These diseases are recognized as mac-
rophage-activation diseases, because increased proinflamma-
tory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-18 are dominantly
produced by macrophages [20,21,25,35,36]. Moreover, HPS
and severe ASD are characterized by the proliferation of mac-
rophages that phagocytose hematopoietic cells in the bone
marrow and their subsequent infiltration into other organs,
accounting in part for the systemic clinical symptoms of these
diseases [20]. In response to various stresses, HO-1 is
strongly expressed in cells of the macrophage lineage, includ-
ing circulating monocytes [37]. We found that PBMCs from
some, but not all, HPS and ASD patients with elevated serum
HO-1 levels overexpressed HO-1 mRNA. It therefore seems
that serum HO-1 proteins may be partly derived from circulat-

ing monocytes in ASD and HPS patients, although other
sources of HO-1 must also be involved.
Useful diagnostic criteria for familial hemophagocytic lympho-
histiocytosis [22,25] are well established, whereas it is some-
times hard to diagnose secondary HPS, especially in adults.
Although the diagnosis requires the histological identification
of hemophagocytosis in organs, the findings are often difficult
to prove even by biopsies of the bone marrow, lymph nodes,
and liver [21,44]. Depressed NK cell activity and increased
soluble IL-2 receptor levels are helpful but are not specific for
the disease. In the early stage of ASD, the diagnostic criteria
[26,27] are not satisfied in some patients.
Hyperferritinemia is found not only in HPS and ASD, but also
in other rheumatic diseases, liver diseases, and hematological
disorders with frequent transfusions. All of these diseases can
be accompanied by cytopenia and/or high fever, leading to dif-
ficulty of differential diagnosis. Since no disease-specific find-
ings have been established, it is important to exclude other
diseases. The delay associated with examinations may delay
the initiation of critically needed therapies. On the other hand,
it is prompt, simple, noninvasive, and informative to measure
serum HO-1 levels by ELISA in such situations.
In contrast to the case with HPS and ASD, hyperferritinemia is
not associated with elevated serum HO-1 levels in patients
with liver disease or hematological diseases requiring frequent
transfusions. This clear distinction suggests that the
combination of increased serum HO-1 plus ferritin provides
greater specificity in the diagnosis of HPS and ASD.
Conclusion
The present study shows that serum HO-1 is a novel marker
for the diagnosis of HPS and ASD and for monitoring disease
activity. Further studies are required to determine the mecha-
nism and sources of increased serum HO-1 in these diseases.
Clarification of the relation between HO-1 and ferritin metabo-
lism will shed further light on the pathogenesis of HPS and
ASD.
