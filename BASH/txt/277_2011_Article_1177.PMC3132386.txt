Abstract Flow cytometric analysis of GPI-anchored pro-
teins (GPI-AP) is the gold standard for diagnosis of
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Due to
therapy options and the relevance of GPI-deficient clones
for prognosis in aplastic anaemia detection of PNH is
gaining importance. However, no generally accepted
standard has been established. This study analysed the
usefulness of a flow cytometric panel with CD58, CD59 on
reticulocytes and erythrocytes, CD24/CD66b and CD16,
FLAER on granulocytes and CD14, and CD48 on mono-
cytes. Actual cut-off (mean+2 SD) for GPI-deficient cells
was established in healthy blood donors. We studied 1,296
flow cytometric results of 803 patients. Serial monitoring
was analysed during a median follow-up of 1,039 days in
155 patients. Of all, 22% and 48% of 155 follow-up
patients. showed significant GPI-AP-deficiency at time of
initial analyses. During follow-up in 9%, a new PNH
diagnosis, and in 28%, a significant change of size or
lineage involvement was demonstrated. Highly significant
correlations for GPI-AP deficiency were found within one
cell lineage (r2
=0.61–0.95, p<0.0001) and between the
different cell lineages (r2
=0.49–0.88, p<0.0001). Especial-
ly for detection of small GPI-deficient populations, retic-
ulocytes and monocytes proved to be sensitive diagnostic
tools. Our data showed superiority of reticulocyte analyses
compared with erythrocyte analyses due to transfusion and
hemolysis independency especially in cases with small
GPI-deficient populations. In conclusion, a screening panel
of at least two different GPI-AP markers on granulocytes,
erythrocytes, and reticulocytes provides a simple and rapid
method to detect even small GPI-deficient populations.
Among the markers in our panel, CD58 and CD59 on
reticulocytes, CD24/66b, and eventually FLAER on gran-
ulocytes as well as CD14 on monocytes were most effective
for flow cytometric diagnosis of GPI deficiency.

Introduction
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired
hematopoietic stem cell disease [1, 2]. Pathophysiologi-
cally, it is based on somatic mutations of the X-linked
phosphatidyl-inositol-glycan gene [3, 4] which result in a
partial or absolute deficiency of GPI-linked proteins [5]. The
lack of GPI-linked proteins leads to the clinical features
chronic intravascular hemolytic anaemia and thromboembo-
lism [31, 32]. The role of GPI-AP in bone marrow failure
which is often associated with PNH is less clear [6].
Measurement of GPI-anchored proteins expression by
flow cytometry is nowadays the gold standard for labora-
BH and HS contributed equally to this manuscript.

tory diagnosis of PNH and has replaced the Ham test and
the sucrose lysis test (sugar water test) [7, 8]. Flow
cytometry allows a sensitive and specific detection of even
small GPI-deficient populations and a quantification of
PNH cell populations in various cell lineages. This
quantification is especially important, as the estimated size
and type of the involved cell lineages correlates with
different clinical manifestations of the disease [14]. For
instance, patients with more than 20% type III deficiency
on red cells mostly have clinically significant hemolysis,
while nearly half of patients with more than 50% GPI
deficiency on the granulocytes suffer from venous throm-
bosis in the first 10 years after initial diagnosis [15].
Therefore, the size of the GPI-AP-deficient population on
granulocytes is a prognostic factor for vascular events,
which have been shown to be the key determinant of
prognosis with the most important impact on life expectan-
cy. Remarkably, clone size and cell lineage involvement
can change over time [6, 12, 21]. This leads to the need of
follow-up investigations to initiate appropriate therapeutic
approaches. Beside initial diagnosis, flow cytometry in
particular, enables serial monitoring during the course of
the disease [9–12]. This allows ontime determination of
therapeutic decisions like initiation of prophylactic anti-
coagulation [15] or application of the C5-antibody eculizu-
mab, which has already proven to reduce hemolytic activity
and thromboembolic events [16–19]. Additionally, thera-
peutic effects may be monitored via flow cytometric
analysis of GPI deficiency. Disappearance of the GPI-
deficient populations indicates effective therapy after stem
cell transplantation, while increase of the GPI-deficient
erythrocyte populations upon eculizumab therapy is pre-
sumable due to a decrease of hemolytic activity with the
result of a prolonged red blood cell (RBC) survival [18].
Although flow cytometric analysis of GPI-AP is the gold
standard for diagnosis of PNH for years, there are no
detailed international or even nationwide rules to determine
minimal demands for PNH diagnosis based on flow
cytometry. There exists just a general advice of the
International PNH Interest Group (IPIG) to examine at
least erythrocytes and granulocytes for diagnosis of PNH
[21]. No consensus recommendations are available for the
choice of GPI-AP markers or even the cell populations
which should be examined. Thus, results from different
laboratories are often difficult to compare and false-
negative or false-positive results are not a rare event.
Moreover, most tests are influenced by hemolytic crises or
RBC transfusions as they rely on GPI deficiency of
erythrocytes. Therefore, in this study, we retrospectively
analysed the results of our routine diagnostics of the last
5 years to assess the most suitable GPI markers and cell
populations for a sensitive, valid, and rapid GPI-AP flow
cytometric analysis for diagnosis and serial testing.
Design and methods
Patients
Flow cytometric GPI-AP analysis was performed in 803
patients suffering from PNH or suspected GPI-deficient
populations. The reason for flow cytometric analysis as
reported by the treating physician were the following
diagnoses or suspected diagnoses: PNH in 67 patients,
hemolysis in 77 patients, aplastic anaemia or trilineage
cytopenia in 291 patients, MDS in 44 patients, single lineage
or bilineage cytopenia in 76 patients, unclear thromboembolic
events or ischemias in 49 patients, other hematologic diseases
in 25 patients, and insufficient information in 174 patients. In
the majority of the patients, blood was sent for routine
diagnostic assessment to our reference diagnostic laboratory
at the Institute of Clinical Transfusion Medicine and
Immunogenetics Ulm for analysis of GPI deficiency as a
diagnostic routine procedure in patients with bone marrow
failure, hemolytic anaemia, iron deficiency anaemia, throm-
bosis, or abdominal pain of unknown origin. Some of the
analyses were performed as diagnostic test in clinical trials
after informed consent and ethical committee approval of the
trial. Patients were included in the follow-up analysis if at least
two GPI-AP assessments with a minimum interval of 3 months
were available (n=155 patients). At time of initial GPI-AP
analysis, blood count was available in 89 of the 155 follow-
up patients; in this patients group, 48/89 patients showed
neutropenia with <0.5 G/l and 70/89 patients had thrombo-
penia with <100 G/l. Patients with eculizumab treatment
were censored at the date of first eculizumab application, and
GPI-AP assessment of these patients during eculizumab
therapy were not included in the analyses presented here.
Five patients who received allogeneic stem cell transplanta-
tion were not censored for analysis.
The pattern of lineage involvement and the suitability of
various lineages and markers in the peripheral blood for
detection of GPI-deficient populations were statistical
analysed retrospectively in all patients. For follow-up, the
size of GPI-deficient populations as well as the evolution of
lineage involvement was investigated.
Two-color flow cytometry
Immunophenotyping was performed as previously de-
scribed [12]. Flow cytometric examinations (1,296) per-
formed between March 2003 and August 2008 were
analysed. Peripheral blood (PB) was obtained by venous
puncture using Na-EDTA or citrate as anti-coagulant. All
incubations were performed at room temperature in the
dark. We used the flow cytometric analysis of CD58 and
CD59 on reticulocytes and erythrocytes and of CD66b/
CD24 and CD16 on granulocytes as mandatory markers for
888 Ann Hematol (2011) 90:887–899
our screening panel. The expressions of CD14 and CD48
on monocytes as well as CD48/CD19 and CD48/CD3 on
lymphocytes were used as optional markers to fully assess
lineage involvement. In 584 cases, a combination of
CD66b/CD24, CD16, and FLAER [23], a fluorochrome-
labelled modified bacterial toxin which binds directly to the
GPI anchor was used to confirm the diagnosis. Staining of
the reticulocytes by the RNA dye thiazol orange allowed a
separate analysis of erythrocytes and reticulocytes.
Staining of erythrocytes and reticulocytes (no wash, stain,
no lyse protocol)
A volume of 100 μL of 1:10 diluted PB in PBS without
Ca2+
/Mg2+
(PAA Laboratories, Paching, Austria) was used
for each assay. As isotype control, diluted PB was
incubated with 20 μL of IgG*PE, clone ×40 (BD
Immunocytometry Systems, Heidelberg, Germany). De-
tection of GPI-deficient erythrocytes and reticulocytes
was performed by staining 100 μL of diluted PB with
either 20 μL of CD58*PE, clone AICD58 (Beckman
Coulter Immunotech, Krefeld, Germany) or 20 μL of
CD*59 PE, clone p282 (H19) (BD Pharmingen, Heidelberg,
Germany). After 20 min, cells were washed once by addition
of 1 mL PBS without Ca2+
/Mg2+
followed by centrifugation
at 5,900×g for 0.5–1 min. The cells of all three assays were
resuspended in 1 mL of ReticCOUNT Reagent (BD
Immunocytometry Systems) and incubated for 20 min–1 h
to stain RNA of reticulocytes before analysis by flow
cytometry (Fig. 1).
Staining of granulocytes, monocytes (no wash, stain, lyse
protocol)
To consider the contribution of different autofluorescences,
separate isotype controls were performed for granulocytes

0.8×106
–1.6×106
leukocytes each, were incubated with
20 μL of IgG*FITC and 20 μL of IgG* PE clone ×40 (both
BD Immunocytometry Systems). Analysis of granulocytes
was performed by staining PB with 10 μL of CD24*FITC,
clone SN3 (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany), 10 μL of
CD66b*FITC, clone 80H3 (Beckman Coulter Immuno-
tech), and 20 μL of CD11b*PE, clone D12 (BD Immuno-
cytometry Systems). In a separate assay, the corresponding
amount of PB was incubated with 10 μL of CD16*FITC,
clone NKP15 and 20 μL of CD11b*PE, clone D12 (both
BD Immunocytometry Systems). For analysis of mono-
cytes, PB was incubated either with 20 μL of CD14*FITC,
clone MOP9 and 20 μL of CD33*PE, clone P67.6 (both
BD Immunocytometry Systems) or 20 μL of CD48*FITC,
clone J4.57 (Beckman Coulter Immunotech) and
20 μL*CD33, clone P67.6 (BD Immunocytometry Sys-
tems), respectively. After 20–30 min, cells were washed
once by addition of 1 mL PBS without Ca2+
/Mg2+
and
centrifugation by 5,900×g for 0.5–1 min. Lysis of eryth-
rocytes was performed by resuspension of the cell pellets in
100 μL OptiLyse B (Beckman Coulter Immunotech),
incubation for 7–15 min, addition of 1 mL aqua followed
by vigorous mixing, and incubation for another 5–15 min.
After lysis of erythrocytes, cells were washed twice using
1 mL PBS without Ca2+
/Mg2+
and resuspended 300–
800 μL PBS without Ca2+
/Mg2+
for flow cytometry
analysis.
Staining of granulocytes (wash, lyse, stain protocol)
For detection of GPI-deficient granulocytes by FLAER
(FITC labeled aerolysin, Protox Biotech, Victoria, Canada),
a volume of PB blood containing approximately 2×105
neutrophils was washed with the fivefold volume of PBS
without Ca2+
/Mg2+
, and the supernatant was discarded.
Erythrocytes were lysed as described above using half the
volume of OptiLyse B and aqua and washed twice, using
PBS without Ca2+
/Mg2+
. Half of the remaining cells were
stained with 2–5 μL of a 1:10 dilution of IgG*PE, clone
×40 (BD Immunocytometry Systems) in PBS, the other half
of the cells was stained with a 1:50 dilution of CD16*PE,
clone 3G8 (BD Pharmingen) in PBS and 0.5–5 μL FLAER,
respectively. After 20–30 min, 1 mL of PBS without Ca2+
/
Mg2+
was added, supernatant was removed after centrifu-
gation at 5,900×g for 30 s–1 min, and cells were
resuspended in 300–800 μL of PBS without Ca2+
/Mg2+
.
Normal range—cut off values of GPI deficiency
In the 5-year observation period every week, healthy blood
donors (overall n=268) were tested for GPI deficiency to
establish cut-off values (mean+2 SD) for GPI-deficient
cells. In respect of variabilities in antibody efficiency, we
updated this cut-off every 6 months with the results of the
last 50–60 examined healthy donors. The valid cut-offs at
the end of the 5-year observation period (overall results of
the 268 healthy donors were put in parentheses) were:
reticulocytes CD58, 0.5% (1.0%), reticulocytes CD 59,
1.9% (2.0%), erythrocytes CD58, 0.1% (0.2%), erythro-
cytes CD59, 0.5% (0.8%), granulocytes CD66b/CD24,
0.1% (0.7%), granulocytes CD16, 1.0 % (1.2%), gran-
ulocytes FLAER*,CD16, 0.3 % (1.2%); monocytes
CD14, 2.5 % (3.3%), monocytes CD48, 1.1% (1.1%).
For flow cytometric diagnosis of a PNH cell population,
at least two cell lineages with significant GPI-deficient
populations were required. Significant GPI-deficient pop-
ulations are defined if all examined markers (minimum, 2)
were exceeding the cut-off value.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses of the data were carried out in Microsoft
Office Access 2003 and GraphPad PRISM, version 4.00.
Used tests were linear regression, including correlations,
coefficient of correlation, and confidence interval as well as
scatter plots. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered as
statistically significant.
Results
Patient characteristics
Patient characteristics for the examined 803 patients (416
male; 382 female) were as follows: the patient age ranged
from 0.4 to 90.7 years (median age, 32.4 years) with no
relevant differences between men (52%) and women (48%)
(Table 1). At initial GPI-AP flow cytometry, 176 of all
patients (22%) were diagnosed with PNH typical GPI-
deficient populations (Fig. 2). The groups with and without
PNH diagnosis at time of initial GPI-AP analysis do not
differ significantly in age and sex distribution. For detailed
patient characteristics, see Table 1.
In the follow-up cohort, 155 patients and 625 flow
cytometric analyses were evaluated (median number of
analyses per patient, 3; range from 2 to 26) for a median
follow-up duration of 1,039 days. Patient characteristics of
the follow-up group are summarised in Table 1.
Blood count was evaluable in 89 of these patients at the
time of initial assessment and in 120 patients at time of the
last examination. Thrombocytopenia<100 G/l was obtained
in 62% at the initial examination and in 43% at the last
examination. Leukocytopenia<0.5 G/l was initially
obtained in 36% and decreased to 18% at the final
investigation (see data supplements).

Flow cytometric results
Analysis of different GPI-anchored markers in the same cell
lineage
Primarily, we compared all flow cytometric results (includ-
ing the follow-up analyses) within each separate cell
lineage to assess the correlation of the various GPI-linked
markers. We found a highly significant correlation between
the markers CD58 and CD59 on reticulocytes (r2
=0.95,
p<0.0001; n=1,284) and erythrocytes (r2
=0.86, p<
0.0001; n=1,284), between CD24/66b and CD16 or
between CD24/66b and CD16, FLAER on granulocytes
(r2
=0.76, p<0.0001; n=1248), and between CD14 and
CD48 on monocytes (r2
=0.62, p<0.0001; n=599)
(Fig. 3). If we restricted the analysis to the first GPI-AP
flow cytometric analysis in each patient, the correlation
did not change considerably (Fig. 3).
Marker analysis between different cell lineages
In a second step, we compared the sizes of various GPI-
marker negative populations in different cell lineages. This
analysis was initially performed for all GPI-AP flow
cytometric results in patients with flow cytometric diagno-
sis of PNH. The following significant correlations were
obtained: CD58-negative reticulocytes and CD58-negative
erythrocytes (n=457, r2
=0.63, p<0.0001), CD59-negative
reticulocytes and CD59-negative erythrocytes (n=455, r2
=
0.61, p<0.0001), CD59-negative reticulocytes and CD24/
D66b-negative granulocytes (n=450, r2
=0.60, p<0.0001),
CD59-negative reticulocytes and CD14-negative mono-
cytes (n=381, r2
=0.68, p<0.0001), CD59-negative eryth-
rocytes and CD24/66b-negative granulocytes (n=449, r2
=
0.33, p<0.0001), CD14-negative monocytes and CD24/
66b-negative granulocytes (n=423, r2
=0.84, p<0.0001),
CD48-negative monocytes and CD24/66b-negative granu-
locytes (n=421, r2
=0.48, p<0.0001) (Fig. 4).
In a second step, the analysis was restricted to the first
flow cytometric analysis of each patient with flow
cytometric diagnosis of PNH. There were no significant
differences between both analyses (Fig. 4).

CD66b-negative granulocyte population, we defined two
different subgroups based on a CD24/CD66b-negative-
granulocyte population <10% or ≥10% at the first investi-
gation. The largest median GPI-deficient population in the
subgroup with <10% CD24/66b-negative granulocyte pop-
ulations was observed for CD14 on monocytes, CD16 or
CD16, FLAER on granulocytes, and CD59 on reticulo-
cytes. In the subgroup, with ≥10% CD24/CD66b-negative-
granulocyte population, the largest median GPI-deficient
population was shown for CD14 on monocytes, CD24/66b
and CD16 as well as CD16, FLAER on granulocytes, and
CD59 on reticulocytes (Fig. 5).
Follow-up analysis
We analysed repeated measurements of GPI-AP expression
on reticulocytes, erythrocytes, granulocytes, and monocytes
in 155 patients (Fig. 6) in order to study the dynamics of
GPI-AP deficient cell populations over time. Since it has
been demonstrated that treatment with eculizumab changes,
the relative proportion of GPI-AP deficient red cells [19],
patients who received eculizumab treatment were censored
at start of this treatment. Median number of analyses per
patient was 3 and the median follow-up duration was
1,039 days (minimum 90 days, maximum 1,903 days).
Initially, 75 (48%) of these patients were diagnosed with
PNH. The longitudinal studies revealed different patterns of
GPI-AP expression during the follow-up period (Figs. 2, 6,
and 7): (A) no significant GPI-AP deficiency fulfilling our
criteria for flow cytometric PNH diagnosis during the
whole investigation period; (B) new flow cytometric
diagnosis of PNH during follow-up after a normal GPI-
AP expression at first investigation; (C) flow cytometric
diagnosis of PNH at initial analysis with stable size of GPI-
deficient granulocyte population during follow-up (defined as
GPI-deficient granulocyte population stable <50% or ≥50%);
(D) flow cytometric diagnosis of PNH at initial analysis with

during longitudinal analysis; (F) disappearance of the PNH
typical GPI-AP deficiency below our criteria for flow
cytometric PNH diagnosis. The cut-off granulocyte clone size
of </≥50% as sign of a relevant quantitative change in clone
size was chosen because of published data about the impact of
this relative proportion for thromboembolic events [15].
Patient characteristics, number of examinations, and duration
of follow-up are summarised in Table 1. In detail, 9% of the
80 patients with no PNH typical GPI-AP deficiency in the
first analysis developed flow cytometric PNH diagnosis
during follow-up (group B). In three of these seven cases
detected during follow-up, diagnosis was based on signifi-
cant GPI-AP-deficient populations on monocytes and gran-
ulocytes. Of the follow-up patients, 28% showed a
significant change of GPI-AP deficiency on granulocytes or
lineage involvement. Moreover, 5 out of the 75 patients
initially diagnosed with PNH developed an emerging GPI-
deficient population on an additional cell lineage or showed
less involved cell lineages during follow-up (group D2 and
E2). In 11% of all cases with flow cytometric diagnosis of
PNH, a significant change of GPI-deficient granulocyte
population occurred (group D1 and E1). In the group of the
seen patients with decrease of GPI-deficient granulocyte
population or disappearance of significant GPI-AP deficien-
cy in a cell line (E1 and E2), two patients received allogeneic
stem cell transplantation, and two patients were treated with
ATG-based immunosuppressive therapy. Only three of these
seven patients suffered from a classical PNH, while four
were diagnosed with associated bone marrow failure
syndromes. All three patients with classical PNH showed a
decrease of GPI-AP deficient population on granulocytes
and no change in cell lineage involvement. Additionally,
eight patients (11%) fulfilled no longer the flow cytometric
criteria of PNH during follow-up (group F). Half of these
eight patients received an ATG-based immunosuppression
and four patients (one was treated for MDS) received an
allogeneic stem cell transplantation before the PNH typical
GPI-AP deficient population pattern disappeared. A sponta-

Discussion
Flow cytometry of GPI-AP is considered to be the gold
standard of PNH diagnosis. CD55 and CD59 expression on
erythrocytes are most frequently used for screening of PNH
[6, 7, 9–14, 21, 22]. Our presented data show that addition
of further antibodies against GPI-linked antigens on
different cell lineages considerably improves the sensitivity
and validity of the method. Among the markers evaluated,
we recommend a panel including at least the following
markers: CD58 and CD59 for reticulocytes and erythro-
cytes a combination of CD24/66b and eventually FLAER
on the granulocytes and CD14 on monocytes.
It has been shown that detection of GPI-deficient
reticulocytes is more sensitive than analysis of erythrocytes,
and reticulocytes better correlates with proportion of GPI-
deficient white cells. The remarkable worse correlation
between erythrocytes and granulocytes compared to the
correlation of reticulocytes and granulocytes (Fig. 4) and

the larger GPI-deficient populations in reticulocyte than
erythrocyte (Fig. 5) are probably caused by RBC trans-
fusions, hemolytic crises, and a shorter life span of PNH
erythrocytes [24, 25]. As reticulocytes are less affected by
these events, their examination for GPI-AP deficiency is
especially suitable for diagnosis of involvement of the red
cell lineage if there are small GPI-deficient granulocyte
populations below 10%. Nevertheless, the most interna-
tional recommendations for flow cytometry still favour
erythrocyte analysis. Our data emphasise the importance of
reticulocyte analysis. Even if reticulocyte clone size
correlates well with white cell clone size, both should be
tested to confirm the flow cytometric diagnosis of PNH
because alteration of GPI-AP on leukocytes can be a sign of
granulocytic/monocytic dysplasia and immaturity ([30],
data supplements) in the context of various myeloid
diseases or cytolysis. Due to our results, participation of
leukocytes is detected best by examination of CD14-
deficiency on monocytes (Fig. 5). Therefore, additional
examination of monocytes provides a higher detection

sensitivity of GPI-AP deficiency especially in patients with
small GPI-deficient granulocyte populations <10%. In fact,
the marker combination CD24/66b and CD16 seems to be
suitable in sensitivity and validity to detect GPI-deficient
granulocytes in our analysis.
Follow-up examination is recommended by the Interna-
tional PNH Interest Group (IPIG) in case of bone marrow
failure syndromes [21] even in case of initially normal flow
cytometric analysis. Moreover, regular follow-up studies
are indicated in case of known PNH to detect substantial
changes in GPI-AP-deficient population size or cell lineage
involvement, as both situations may prompt therapeutic
consequences or may demonstrate effect of therapeutic
interventions. Therefore, we evaluated our panel on
different cell lineages for longitudinal monitoring of GPI-
deficient populations to determine the frequency of significant
changes in cell lineage involvement and GPI-deficient popula-
tion size. Our definition of a relevant change in GPI-deficient
population size (</≥50% GPI deficiency on granulocytes) is
based on data published by Hall et al. [15], demonstrating that
patients with a GPI-deficient population on granulocytes
≥50% have a significant higher risk of thromboembolic
events. Our results again support the importance of GPI-AP
measurement on reticulocytes to obtain results independent of
hemolytic crisis and RBC transfusions.
The described flow cytometry panel could be used for
serial monitoring during follow-up to detect evolution of
GPI-AP deficient populations and to assess therapy effects.
Although follow-up investigations were performed only in
a minority of patients with initially normal results (80 out of
627 patients), in seven of the follow-up patients, PNH was
newly diagnosed. Based on our follow-up data with a
relevant proportion of newly developing GPI-AP-deficient
populations and significant changes in the size of GPI-AP-
deficient populations, repeated GPI-AP analysis in regular
intervals should be performed, like it is recommended by
the International PNH Interest Group (IPIG) [21]. Another
interesting fact in our follow-up data is the absence of
spontaneous remissions of PNH typical GPI-AP-deficient
populations which had been reported. A study with 35
patients referred a rate of 15% spontaneous remissions [6]
in PNH patients, but available GPI-AP flow cytometric
results and even HAM-test were limited in this study. All
observed remissions in our patient group happened in the
context of stem cell transplantation or intensified immuno-
suppressive therapy especially in patients with AA-PNH
syndrome. The reported three patients with classical PNH
and decrease of the GPI-AP deficient population on
granulocytes below 50% developed an increase over 50%
GPI-deficient cells on the granulocytes during further
follow-up.
Generally, expression of GPI-anchored proteins should
be analysed in all situations suspicious of PNH and in bone
marrow failure syndromes [20]. According to our data,
measurement of at least two different GPI-anchored
proteins on granulocytes, erythrocytes, and reticulocytes
provides a simple and rapid method to detect even small
GPI-deficient populations. Measurement of erythrocytes
only includes the pitfall of false-negative results or false
low values of GPI-deficient populations. On the contrary,
examination of GPI deficiency on reticulocytes additionally
prevents false positive interpretation of significant GPI-
deficient populations on the leukocytes (data supplements).
GPI-AP deficiencies without clinical PNH were reported in
the context of other hematologic diseases or after
immunosuppressive therapy [26] as well as in healthy
individuals [27, 28]. Our data demonstrate that in patients
with small GPI-deficient populations, these can in partic-
ular be detected on monocytes. In conclusion, we
recommend a flow cytometric screening panel with the
markers CD58 and CD59 on reticulocytes and erythro-
cytes as well as with the markers CD24/66b and CD16 on
granulocytes for initial diagnosis and monitoring during
follow-up. In case of significant GPI-AP-deficient popu-
lation in a minimum of one cell lineage, the analysis
should be extended to the markers CD14 and CD48 on
monocytes. Furthermore, we advise a serial monitoring for
PNH patients as well as for patients with bone marrow

Recently, Richards et al. [29] showed that a relevant
proportion of laboratories doing PNH testing by flow
cytometry have significant problems with regard to false-
positive and false-negative results. On the other hand, due
to the advent of a new targeted therapy option, early
diagnosis and serial monitoring of PNH is gaining
importance for a better patient management [17]. As a
consequence, there is the urgent need for optimised flow
cytometric protocols in PNH diagnosis. In conclusion, this
analysis has demonstrated that the described flow cytomet-
ric method offers significant benefits in sensitivity and
validity in PNH testing and can be therefore recommended
for a wider use.
