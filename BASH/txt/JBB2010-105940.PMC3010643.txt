Compared to bone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from human origin or from other species, the in vitro
expansion and puriﬁcation of murine MSCs (mMSCs) is much more diﬃcult because of the low MSC yield and the unwanted
growth of non-MSCs in the in vitro expansion cultures. We describe a modiﬁed protocol to isolate and expand murine BM
derived MSCs based on the combination of mechanical crushing and collagenase digestion at the moment of harvest, followed
by an immunodepletion step using microbeads coated with CD11b, CD45 and CD34 antibodies. The number of isolated mMSCs
as estimated by colony forming unit-ﬁbroblast (CFU-F) assay showed that this modiﬁed isolation method could yield 70.0%
more primary colonies. After immunodepletion, a homogenous mMSC population could already be obtained after two passages.
Immunodepleted mMSCs (ID-mMSCs) are uniformly positive for stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1), CD90, CD105 and CD73 cell
surface markers, but negative for the hematopoietic surface markers CD14, CD34 and CD45. Moreover the immunodepleted
cell population exhibits more diﬀerentiation potential into adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages. Our data illustrate
the development of an eﬃcient and reliable expansion protocol increasing the yield and purity of mMSCs and reducing the overall
expansion time.
1. Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells are self-renewing and multipotent
progenitors that can diﬀerentiate into a variety of cell types,
including adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myocytes,
hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, neurons, and beta-pancreatic
islets cells [1–4]. BM is the most common source of MSCs.
However, MSCs have also been isolated from various other
sources, namely, placenta, amniotic ﬂuid, cord blood, fetal
liver, and adipose tissue [5–9]. MSCs have been referred by
other terminology such as colony-forming ﬁbroblastic cells,
marrow stromal stem cells, and mesenchymal progenitor
cells [10–12]. At present, MSCs are reported to possess,
besides their multipotent diﬀerentiation capacity, also other
properties such as low immunogenicity and tissue-homing
ability making them an attractive tool for cell-mediated
therapy in several diseases processes, including tissue injury
and tissue degeneration as well as graft-versus-host disease
[13–16].
MSCs have been successfully isolated and characterized
from BM samples of many species including human, rabbit,
rat, sheep, goat, rhesus monkeys, dog, and pig through
their preferential attachment to tissue culture plastic [17–
25]. In contrast, the isolation and puriﬁcation of mMSCs
from BM has been more diﬃcult than that from human
and other species whose marrow adherent cells are relatively
homogenous and contain a high percentage of MSCs. The
future use of MSCs for human disease therapies depends on
the establishment of representative and eﬃcient preclinical
animal models. In many respects, a murine model is an ideal
model to study the cell biology and the therapeutic potential
of MSCs. The standard method of plastic adherence has,
2 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology
however, proven ineﬀective to yield relatively pure mMSCs
populations since various hematopoietic cell lineages survive
and/or proliferate on stromal layers, even in the absence of
exogenous cytokines [26]. The majority of the contaminated
hematopoietic cells can be removed after a prolonged
expansion time by frequent subculturing. The MSCs diﬀer-
entiation potentials might, however, decrease during long-
term in vitro culture. In addition, several reports suggest that
mMSCs can undergo spontaneous transformation following
long term in vitro culture [27–29]. So far, several techniques
have been described to reduce or eliminate non-MSCs from
plastic adherent murine BM cultures, including the use of
low-density culture, frequent medium change, and positive
and negative selection [30–37]. However, none of these
techniques has gained widespread acceptance so far. It is,
therefore, still necessary to develop a standardized, reliable,
and easy-to-perform method to obtain high amounts of
puriﬁed mMSCs, but with reduced expansion time to avoid
possible transformation and to retain the diﬀerentiation
potential of the expanded stem cells. Our present study
aimed to develop an improved method to increase the yield
and purity of culture-expanded mMSCs.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. mMSCs Modiﬁed Harvest and Primary Culture.
C57BL/KaLwRij mice (Harlan CPB, The Netherlands), 6–8
weeks old, were sacriﬁced by cervical dislocation. The hind
legs and vertebrae were dissected and carefully cleaned
from adherent tissues. The standard accepted isolation for
BM-derived MSCs was to ﬂush BM cells from hind legs [38].
Here, we modiﬁed the harvest protocol. After the tips of each
bone were removed and the BM was collected by ﬂushing
out the content of femurs and tibias with RPMI 1640 (Lonza,
Verviers, Belgium), we further chopped the femurs, tibias
and vertebrae into ﬁne pieces (1-2 mm) with a scalpel and
crushed gently with the back side of a 5-ml syringe in RPMI
1640. Next, the bone fragments were transferred into a 50 ml
polypropylene tube with 10 ml 0.25% Collagenase A solution
(Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The
tube with bone fragments and Collagenase A solution was
placed in 37◦
C water bath for 30 minutes. Next phosphate
buﬀered saline (PBS) was added to a ﬁnal volume of 30 ml.
When the fragments were settled, supernatant was collected,
mixed with the previously harvested cells, and ﬁltered
through 70-μm nylon mesh ﬁlter. Cells were then washed
twice with PBS, and subsequently nucleated and viable cells
were counted in a hemocytometer using 3% Acetic acid
with Crystal Violet and Trypan Blue, respectively. Cells were
plated at 1 × 106
cells/cm2 in McCoy’s 5A media (Lonza,
Verviers, Belgium) containing 20% mesenchymal stem cell
stimulatory supplements for mouse (Stem Cell Technologies,
Vancouver, BC, Canada), 1% L-glutamine(Lonza, Verviers,
Belgium), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza, Verviers,
Belgium). The culture was kept in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2
incubator at 37◦
C for 24–48 hours, followed by removal
of nonadherent cells with PBS and replacement with fresh
complete medium. All of the procedures involving mice were
approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments,
VUB (license no. LA1230281).
2.2. Increasing the Purity of in Vitro Expanded mMSCs by
Immunodepletion and mMSCs Subculture. After about 7–
10 days, when primary cultures (passage 0) became nearly
conﬂuent, the cells were detached with 0.25% trypsin/0.02%
EDTA for 5 minutes at 37◦
C. The residual cells which were
not detached within 5 minutes were collected by gentle
scraping using a cell scraper. The cells were resuspended
in 1 ml 0.1%BSA/PBS, followed by an immunodepletion
using anti-CD11b, CD34, CD45-conjugated Dynabeads M-
280 Streptavidin superparamagnetic polystyrene beads (In
vitrogen Dynal AS, Oslo, Norway) according to the man-
ufacturer’s instruction. In brief, Dynabeads were washed
with 0.1%BSA/PBS for 5 times and then precoated with the
following biotinylated antibodies, respectively, at appropriate
concentration (5–10 μg antibodies per mg Dynabeads M-
280 streptavidin) by incubation for 30 minutes at room
temperature using gentle rotation: Biotin antimouse CD11b,
CD34 and CD45 (eBioscience, San Diego, USA). Three
consecutive rounds of immunodepletion using antibodies
against CD11b, CD34 and CD45, respectively, were per-
formed for depleting contaminated non-MSCs. In each case,
cells and antibody conjugated Dynabeads were thoroughly
mixed at a ratio of 1 cell: 5 beads and incubated on the rotator
for 30 minutes at 4◦
C. Then, cells were washed using a Dynal
MPC to remove unbound cells. The immunodepleted cells
were suspended in complete medium, plated in one T-25
ﬂask at 1000 cells/cm2 (Nunc, VWR International, Leuven,
Belgium) followed by incubation in a 37◦
C with 5% CO2
humidiﬁed incubator. Culture medium was changed every
3-4 days until cell culture reached 80%–90% conﬂuence. At
that point cells were trypsinized (passage 1) and plated in
one T-75 ﬂask at 1000 cells/cm2. Subsequent passages were
performed similarly, but split ratios were 1 : 2 (T-75 ﬂask).
2.3. CFU-F Assay. The CFU-F assay was performed as
described previously [39]. In brief, 1 × 106
nucleated cells
obtained from fresh BM were plated into each well of
a six-well plate and incubated for 10 days in humidiﬁed
atmosphere (37◦
C, 5% CO2). Culture medium was changed
on days 3 and 8 of culture. Subsequently, cultures were ﬁxed
and stained with Giemsa. The number of colonies displaying
ﬁve or more cells with spindled mMSCs morphology was
scored under an inverted microscope. Colonies whose mor-
phology clearly diﬀered from the mMSC morphology were
excluded from the results. This assay was performed using
BM samples from 10 mice (for 5 mice, cells were isolated
using Collagenase, while for 5 other mice cells were isolated
without Collagenase). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate.
2.4. Growth Curve and Doubling Time. Passage 1 mMSCs
were plated in 6-well culture plates at 2000 cells/well in
medium with 20% mesenchymal stem cell stimulatory
supplements or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells from
each well were trypsinized and counted in duplicate with a
hemocytometer every two days until day 12. The doubling

anti-mouse IgG served as negative controls. After 30 minutes,
unbound antibody was washed with 2 ml 1%HuAlb/PBS.
Next, the cells were incubated with 10 μL mouse antirat
ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) antibody at 4◦
C for 30
minutes followed by a wash with 2 ml 1%HuAlb/PBS. The
cell pellets were resuspended in 600 μl PBS and examined by
ﬂow cytometry (Coulter Epics XL-MCL, Brussels, Belgium)
with 5,000 events being recorded for each condition. The
results were analyzed by cell quest software and WinMDI 2.8
software was used to create the histograms.
2.6. Diﬀerentiation Assays
2.6.1. Adipogenic Diﬀerentiation. For adipogenic diﬀerenti-
ation, 2 × 105
P3 mMSCs were seeded into a well of a
6-well plate (Nunc, VWR International, Leuven, Belgium)
and fed every 2-3 days by replacing the complete medium
until a conﬂuent cell layer was formed. Then cells, were
stimulated to diﬀerentiate into the adipogenic lineage by
submitting them to three cycles of alternating culture
in adipogenic induction medium (LONZA, Walkersville,
USA) and adipogenic maintenance medium (LONZA, Walk-
ersville, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. The adipogenic induction medium contains according
to the manufacture Insulin (recombinant), L-glutamine,
MCGS, dexamethasone, indomethacin, IBMX (3-isobuty-l-
methyl-xanthine), and Pen/Strep, while the the Adipogenic
Maintenance Medium includes insulin (recombinant), L-
Glutamine, MCGS, and pen/strep. At the end of these
cycles, cells were grown for another 7 days in adipogenic
maintenance medium. As a control MSC were grown in
Adipogenic Maintenance Medium only to exclude sponta-
neous adipogenic diﬀerentiation. To visualize adipocytes,
cells were stained with Oil Red O (Sigma, Bornem, Belgium)
[40].
2.6.2. Osteogenic Diﬀerentiation. Osteogenic diﬀerentiation
was induced by exposing 3 × 104
P3 mMSCs to osteogenic
induction medium (LONZA, Walkersville, USA) into a
well of a 6-well plate. The medium was changed every 3
to 4 days. As a negative control, cells were cultured in
complete medium and medium was changed at the same
frequency as that for the diﬀerentiating MSC. The osteogenic
induction medium contains according to the manufacturer
dexamethasone, L-Glutamine, ascorbate, Pen/Strep, MCGS,
and glycerophosphate. To verify osteogenic diﬀerentiation,
von Kossa’s method was used to stain calcium deposits
[41].
Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology 5
2.6.3. Chondrogenic Diﬀerentiation. In order to induce chon-
drogenic diﬀerentiation 2.5 × 105
P3 mMSCs were washed
twice in incomplete chondrogenesis induction medium
(LONZA, Walkersville, USA). Cells were then sedimented
by centrifugation at 150 g for 5 minutes and 0.5 mL com-
plete chondrogenesis induction medium (LONZA, Walk-
ersville, USA) was added to the cell pellet. Incomplete
chondrogenesis induction medium contains according to
the manufacturer dexamethasone, ascorbate, ITS + supple-
ment, pen/strep, sodium pyruvate, Proline and L-Glutamine.
Complete medium was made by adding 5 μL TGFβ3
(LONZA, Walkersville, USA) to 1 mL incomplete medium.
The medium was changed every 3 to 4 days. After 21 days
of culture, the pellets were embedded in paraﬃn, cut into
4 μm sections and immunohistochemically stained by A
rabbit polyclonal anticollagen II antibody (NCL-COLL-IIp,
NovoCastra, Prosan, Merelbeke, Belgium).
2.7. Statistical Analysis. Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed
by comparing mean values (±SD) using Mann Whitney test.
P < .05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
As shown in the ﬂow chart (Figure 1), the isolation and
expansion method of BM-derived mMSCs includes a combi-
nation of mechanical bone crushing, enzymatic treatment of
bone fragments, and ﬂushing out BM cells at the harvest step
with immunodepletion of CD11b+, CD34+, and CD45+
cells in the following culture step.
The number of BM-nucleated cells harvested with the
modiﬁed method was 19.4% higher than the number of BM
nucleated cells obtained by the standard method although
this diﬀerence was not signiﬁcant (data not shown). How-
ever, with the modiﬁed harvest method, the mean number of
colonies was 70.0% more than the mean number of colonies
obtained by the standard method (P < .05) (Figure 2(a)).
The number of colonies displaying ﬁve or more cells was
scored under an inverted microscope (Figure 2(c)). Colonies
with four cells were counted when one of them presented
two nuclei. Colonies whose morphology clearly diﬀered
from the mMSC morphology were excluded from the
results. We compared medium with fetal bovine serum
(FBS) to medium with mesenchymal stem cell stimulatory
supplements (mouse) from Stem cell technologies and
found that cells cultured with Mesenchymal Stem Cell
Stimulatory Supplements showed a higher proliferation rate
(Figure 3).
Using the standard expansion conditions, cultures usu-
ally remained morphologically heterogeneous at passage 2,
presenting round, polygonal, spindle-shaped, and ﬂattened
cells (Figure 4). Some degree of morphological heterogene-
ity could still be observed up to passage 6–8 (data not
shown). However, using the immunodepletion step, much
less heterogeneity could be observed, and at passage 2, a
homogeneous population of spindle-shaped cells could be
observed. The doubling time of ID-mMSCs was found to be
46.9 ± 1.78 h.

Cultured cells already appeared homogeneous already at passage
2 while controls remain heterogeneous (×100). Representative
pictures are shown, n = 6/group, scale bar = 100μm.
We further investigated whether the two diﬀerent harvest
methods had an eﬀect on the yields of ID-mMSCs. The result
showed that using the same immunodepletion procedure,
the ID-mMSC yield with the standard isolation method
was 3.7%, while the yield with the modiﬁed isolation
method could reach up to 6.6% (Figure 5(a)), conﬁrming
that our modiﬁed isolation method results in a higher mMSC
harvest.
The cells (cultured with and without immunodepletion)
were further analyzed for cell surface antigens at passage
3. Results showed that ID-mMSCs were strongly positive
for CD90, CD73 and Sca-1, but totally negative for CD14,
CD34, and CD45 (Figure 5(b)). The cell population cul-
tured without immunodepletion showed signiﬁcantly less
expression of CD90, CD73, and Sca-1 but more expression
of CD45 compared with ID-mMSCs (Figure 5(c)). Without
immunodepletion mMSCs still seemed to be contaminated
with hematopoietic cells after 5-6 passages, which was
consistent with the morphological observations.
Tri-lineage diﬀerentiation abilities of cells cultured with
and without immunodepletion were tested at passage 3.
When cultured in adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondro-
genic media, cells were able to diﬀerentiate exclusively into
adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes as determined by

tively. However, the diﬀerentiation abilities were signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent. The extent of adipogenic diﬀerentiation was quan-
tiﬁed by counting Oil red O-positive cells per cm2. As shown
in Figure 6(a), the amount of Oil red O-positive cells in the
immunodepleted group was signiﬁcantly higher than that
of the control group. When osteogenic diﬀerentiation was
examined using a bone nodule formation assay, von Kossa
staining revealed that cells cultured after immunodepletion
produced signiﬁcantly more calcium nodules than cells
cultured without immunodepletion (Figure 6(b)). In accor-
dance, chondrogenic diﬀerentiation of ID-cells was more
pronounced compared to control cells (Figure 6(c)). These
data indicate that a higher purity of multipotent mouse
MSCs can be achieved after immunodepletion of CD11b,
CD34, and CD45 positive cells. Moreover, we observed that
late passage ID-mMSCs (at passage 8) retained their robust
capacity to diﬀerentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and
chondrocytes (Figure 7).
4. Discussion
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have generated a great
deal of interest and promise as a potential source of cells
for cell-based therapeutic strategies for tissue repair and
regenerative diseases, primarily owing to their intrinsic
ability to self renew and diﬀerentiate into functional cell
types that constitute the tissue in which they exist. At
present, there is also a great interest for genetically modiﬁed
MSCs in cell-based therapy for cancers based on the
rationale of tumor-homing properties of MSCs. However,
most of MSC therapeutic applications are still in preclinical
studies.
Friedenstein and his colleagues ﬁrstly established MSCs
culture from guinea pig by virtue of MSCs preferential
attachment to plastic ﬂasks [38], and the original method
has been further used for the culture BM MSCs from human
and other experimental animals [17–22]. This method
has, however, proven ineﬃcient for mMSCs due to low
mMSCs number and contamination of hematopoietic cells
in the cultures. To solve this problem, many groups have
developed various modiﬁed mMSCs culture conditions to
obtain suﬃcient numbers of cells in the shortest time and
with the highest homogeneity. Kopen et al. ﬁrstly developed
a method to eliminate myelopoietic cells using an anti-
CD11b antibody, but this protocol could not deplete all
the hematopoietic cells [33]. Baddoo et al. presented a
modiﬁed puriﬁcation approach based on immunodepletion

of CD11b/CD34/CD45 positive cells from cultured BM
cells [34]. In one study, positive selection was performed
in an attempt to obtain a more homogeneous mMSCs
population [32]. But since there is no speciﬁc marker for
MSCs, other non-MSCs were unavoidable introduced into
the cultures. Moreover, several other techniques, includ-
ing optimization of culture density and frequent medium
change, have also been proposed but these protocols are
not standardized [30, 31]. Therefore, it remains necessary
to develop a reliable and easy method to isolate and
expand a homogeneous population of mMSCs from mouse
BM.
The standard method that is used for isolation of murine
BM-derived MSCs is to ﬂush BM cells from hind legs of
mice. However, with this method, the frequency of collected
MSCs is rather low [42]. Our harvest method involves not
only ﬂushing out BM cells, but also crushing the bones of
hind legs and vertebrae as well as enzymatical treatment
of the bones with Collagenase (Figure 1(a)). Stromal cells
are present in the endosteum whereas mature hematopoietic
cells exist in the center of the BM [43, 44]. Because of this
deep location, it is diﬃcult to obtain enough MSCs even after
strong ﬂushing during marrow cell harvest. In this study,
using the modiﬁed isolation method, we could isolate 19.4%
more BM-nucleated cells than the standard method. CFU-F
assay, which was used to detect and evaluate the frequency of
the MSCs in fresh BM, has furthermore been used to validate
the eﬀectiveness of this modiﬁed method (Figures 2(b) and
2(c)).
After harvesting BM with our modiﬁed protocol, we
performed magnetic cell sorting after the ﬁrst passage using
negative selection with CD11b/CD34/CD45 antibodies-
coupled microbeads as proposed by Baddoo et al. [34]
(Figure 1(b)). Two consecutive rounds of immunodepletion,
removing respectively CD11b-positive monocytic cells and
CD34-positive hematopoietic stem cells can deplete the
major part of contaminated cells, and the third round
of CD45-positive cells depletion could further eliminate
all residual contaminated hematopoietic cells. We found
that after immunodepletion the MSCs population appeared
much more homogeneous showing mostly spindle-shaped,
cells (Figure 4), while under the standard expansion condi-
tions, cultures usually remained morphologically highly het-
erogeneous until passage 5-6, presenting round, polygonal,
spindle-shaped and ﬂattened cells. Some degree of morpho-
logical heterogeneity could still be observed up to passage
6–8 or more. Although the CD11b/CD34/CD45 immunode-
pletion protocol did remove almost all the contaminated
hematopoietic cells from the BM cultures, we have to notice
that the nucleated cell yield in our mouse strain was low after
the immunodepletion step in combination with the standard
harvest method (3.7% on average). However, we observed
that after CD11b/CD34/CD45 immunodepletion in combi-
nation with our modiﬁed BM harvest method, the yield of
nucleated cells was nearly twice higher (Figure 5(a)). The
immunodepleted cells cultured up to passage 3 were positive
for CD90, CD73, and Sca-1 but totally negative for CD14,
CD34, and CD45 (Figure 5(b)), while control cells were still
signiﬁcantly contaminated with CD45+ cells and slightly
contaminated with CD14+ and CD34+ cells (Figure 5(c)).
In addition to morphology and phenotype, the biological
property that uniquely identiﬁes MSCs is their capacity for
tri-lineage mesenchymal diﬀerentiation. So, we further tested
the tri-lineage diﬀerentiation ability of ID-mMSCs and
control cells at passage 3. ID-mMSCs and control cells were
both able to diﬀerentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and
chondrocytes determined by Oil Red O, von Kossa and type
II collagen staining when exposed to respectively adipogenic,
osteogenic, and chondrogenic media. However, with the
same initial cell numbers and induction conditions, ID-
mMSCs exhibited a more vigorous tri-lineage diﬀerentiation
potential as compared to the control cells (Figure 6) and
can retain their robust diﬀerentiation potential at least until
passage 8 (Figure 7). Based on the morphology, phenotype,
and diﬀerentiation potential in vitro, we can conclude that
immunodepleted mMSCs are more puriﬁed in the early
passages.

5. Conclusion
Taken together, the current study presents an eﬀective,
quick and easy-to-perform method for enrichment and
puriﬁcation of murine BM derived mesenchymal stem cells
in vitro by combining mechanical crushing and Collage-
nase treatment at the moment of harvest and a negative
immunodepletion step during the in vitro expansion culture.
This protocol can facilitate the in vitro and in vivo study of
mMSCs, both for examining their biological properties as
well as their therapeutic potential in various murine disease
models.
