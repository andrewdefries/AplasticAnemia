Abstract
GATA-2 is an essential transcription factor in the hematopoietic system that is expressed in
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitors. Complete deficiency of GATA-2 in the
mouse leads to severe anemia and embryonic lethality. The role of GATA-2 and dosage effects
of this transcription factor in HSC development within the embryo and adult are largely unex-
plored. Here we examined the effects of GATA-2 gene dosage on the generation and expansion
of HSCs in several hematopoietic sites throughout mouse development. We show that a haploid
dose of GATA-2 severely reduces production and expansion of HSCs specifically in the aorta-
gonad-mesonephros region (which autonomously generates the first HSCs), whereas quantitative
reduction of HSCs is minimal or unchanged in yolk sac, fetal liver, and adult bone marrow.
However, HSCs in all these ontogenically distinct anatomical sites are qualitatively defective in
serial or competitive transplantation assays. Also, cytotoxic drug-induced regeneration studies
show a clear GATA-2 dose–related proliferation defect in adult bone marrow. Thus, GATA-2
plays at least two functionally distinct roles during ontogeny of HSCs: the production and ex-
pansion of HSCs in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros and the proliferation of HSCs in the adult
bone marrow.

Introduction
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) at the foundation of the
adult hematopoietic differentiation hierarchy have the ability
to self-renew and produce all the distinct blood cell lineages
(1, 2). HSCs capable of complete long-term hematopoietic
repopulation of irradiated adult recipients are first generated
in the aorta-gonads-mesonephros (AGM) region at mid–
embryonic day (E)10.5 (3, 4) and localize to the dorsal aorta,
vitelline, and umbilical arteries (5). Subsequently, at mid/late
E11, HSC activity is also found in the yolk sac (YS) and fetal
liver (FL). HSC activity increases significantly in E11 AGM
and E12 YS when they are cultured as whole tissue explants
for 3 d (3, 6). Although the spatial and temporal appearance
of HSCs during development has been described and quanti-
tated, the molecular mechanisms underlying HSC genera-
tion, expansion, and maintenance are not well explored.
One molecule important during hematopoietic ontogeny is
GATA-2, a member of the GATA family of zinc finger
transcription factors (7, 8). RT-PCR analysis shows high
expression of GATA-2 in adult hematopoietic progenitor
cells and HSCs (9, 10). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry,
in situ hybridization, and transgenic analyses show GATA-2
expression as early as E8 in the para-aortic splanchnopleura
(precursor tissue to AGM) and subsequently in the AGM
(11, 12). In the E11.5 AGM, GATA-2 is expressed in the
aortic endothelium and neighboring mesenchymal cells,
which are both considered putative hemogenic cell popula-
tions. Embryos lacking GATA-2 are anemic, have moder-
ately reduced numbers of primitive erythroid cells and he-

matopoietic progenitor cells (13), and die at E10.5, the
time of HSC induction and expansion. Due to this lethal-
ity, the role of GATA-2 has been examined mainly by in
vitro colony-forming assays of cells from early embryonic
tissues and hematopoietic cultures of GATA-2Ϫ/Ϫ embry-
onic stem (ES) cells. In both cases, hematopoietic progeni-
tor numbers are severely reduced. Further studies in chi-
meric mice produced with GATA-2Ϫ/Ϫ ES cells show no
contribution of the mutant cells to any hematopoietic tis-
sues. Together, these data indicate that GATA-2 is crucial
for the maintenance, proliferation, and/or survival of im-
mature hematopoietic progenitors (13).
The function of GATA-2 had also been studied through
enforced overexpression achieved by retroviral transduc-
tion or transfection of genes encoding either a wild-type
GATA-2 or an inducible GATA-2–estrogen receptor (ER)
fusion protein (12, 14–19). Irrespective of these attempts, a
simple conclusion on the function of GATA-2 in the
HSCs or progenitor cells is difficult. On one hand, expres-
sion of the inducible form of GATA-2–ER fusion protein
in the multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell line FDCP
promotes differentiation (17). On the other hand, constitu-
tive expression of GATA-2 in murine BM cells blocked
progenitor-derived colony formation (14). The opposing
results may be due to the cell types chosen for these exper-
iments. However, it is also suggested that the biochemical
behavior of the artificially generated GATA-2–ER fusion
protein may not be the same as the wild-type unmodified
GATA-2 protein (18). Thus, the most relevant data on
GATA-2 dose effects on hematopoiesis may be best ob-
tained within the physiological context of the whole or-
ganism wherein GATA-2 is expressed under the endoge-
nous regulatory machinery in the appropriate cell types.
The study of transcription factor dose and function at the
earliest stages of hematopoietic development is of particular
interest for an understanding of HSC generation. Studies on
the runx1 transcription factor have shown that a haploid
dose results in changes in HSC induction, expansion, and
distribution in the midgestation mouse embryo (20). More-
over, haploinsufficiency of human Runx1 (AML-1) results
in thromobocytopenia and a propensity to develop myeloid
leukemia (21). Recently, a correlation between a reduction
in GATA-2 expression and aplastic anemia (22) has been
demonstrated. Hence, to further understand the role of
GATA-2 in the ontogeny of HSCs we examined the effects
of GATA-2 haploinsufficiency on induction and expansion
of HSCs during development by in vivo hematopoietic
transplantation assays and phenotypic analysis of compound
transgenic embryos (GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ–Ly-6A GFP) (23).
Here we present data showing that the numbers of he-
matopoietic progenitors in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ embryos are re-
duced. More importantly, we observe a dramatic quantita-
tive reduction in HSC activity specifically in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ
AGMs and a further reduction in the serial repopulating
ability of these HSCs. In contrast, GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ HSC num-
bers appear quantitatively normal in the adult BM but are
qualitatively defective in the setting of competitive trans-
plantation. In addition, GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ HSCs exhibit a delay
in regeneration of the hematopoietic system after cytotoxic
drug challenge, suggesting that GATA-2 levels play a role
in HSC proliferation. Thus, GATA-2 plays functionally
distinct roles in the production of HSCs in the AGM re-
gion and the proliferation of HSCs throughout ontogeny.
Materials and Methods
GATA-2 Mutant Mice and Embryos. GATA-2 mutant mice
(13) were backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 background for over
10 generations and were housed in the Erasmus Medical Center
Animal unit according to the institution guidelines with food and
water provided ad libitum. The day of vaginal plug discovery
from overnight matings (GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ male ϫ C57BL/6 GATA-
2ϩ/ϩ or GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ female) was counted as day 0. Pregnant
dams were killed and embryos isolated from the uterus as de-
scribed previously (24). Embryos (E10–E11) were staged by
counting somite pairs (25). Genotyping was performed by
PCR as described previously (13). Compound transgenic em-
bryos were obtained by mating Ly-6A GFP hemizygous (23) and
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ mice.
Dissection, Explant Culture, Cell Preparation, and In Vivo Trans-
plantation. Dissections, tissue explants, and cell preparation were
performed as described previously (24). Recipient mice (C57BL/6
or [129Sv ϫ C57BL/6] F1 females, 8–16 wk old) received a split
dose of 1,000 rad (for colony-forming unit–spleen [CFU-S11]),
900 rad (for HSCs), or 640 rad (for competitive repopulation as-
say) at a 3-h interval from a 137Cs source on the day of donor cell
injection. Cells were injected i.v. into the tail veins. Except for
CFU-S, serial, and competitive transplantation assays, 2 ϫ 105 fe-
male spleen cells from the recipient strain were coinjected to pro-
vide short-term survival. Secondary transplantations were per-
formed with 3 ϫ 106 BM cells from the primary recipients. Cell
dose for competitive repopulation assays was 3 ϫ 105–3 ϫ 107.
Injected animals were provided with 0.16% Neomycin (Sigma-
Aldrich)-supplemented water. For CFU-S11, recipients were killed
at 11 d posttransplantation by cervical dislocation, spleens iso-
lated, and microscopic colonies scored after fixing with Teley-
nesnicki’s solution overnight.
Semiquantitative PCR for Donor Contribution. Blood, tissue, or
specific cell lineage DNA (100 ng) was used for semiquantitative
PCR to detect the donor HSC contribution to the recipient. For
male-derived donor cells, YMT-specific PCR (350-bp product)
was used together with myogenin-specific PCR (250 bp) for
DNA normalization. The detection of GATA-2 mutant–derived
donor cells was performed with GATA-2/NEO (950 bp) and
GATA-2 wild-type (600 bp) PCR. Primers and PCR conditions
were as previously described (4, 13).
Cell Sorting and Flow Cytometry Analysis. FACS was per-
formed on a FACS Vantage SE (Becton Dickinson) (23), and
flow cytometric analyses were performed on a FACSCalibur dual
laser instrument (Becton Dickinson) with CellQuest software
(BD Bioscience). Staining of embryonic tissue cell suspensions
was performed in PBS supplemented with 10% FCS, and 2 ␮g/
ml 7AAD (Molecular Probes) was added for dead cell exclusion.
Staining of adult HSCs was performed in PBS supplemented with
0.5% BSA. Biotin-conjugated anti–Gr-1 (ER-MP20) was a gift
from Dr. P.J.M. Leenen (Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Nether-
lands). All other antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences
including APC-conjugated anti–c-kit (clone 2B8), PE-conju-
gated anti–Sca-1 (clone D7), PerCP-Cy5.5–conjugated anti-
CD8a (clone 53–6.7), anti-B220 (clone RA3-6B2), anti-CD19

(1D3), anti-CD11b (anti–Mac-1, clone M1/70), and biotin-con-
jugated anti-CD3 (145-2C11), anti-CD4 (H129.19), Ly-76 (TER-
119), anti-IgM (II/41), and anti-NK1.1 (PK136). A secondary
step was sometimes performed with streptavidin-conjugated
PerCP-Cy5.5 (BD Biosciences).
Immunohistochemistry. Embryos were fixed for 30 min with
2% paraformaldehyde/PBS at 4ЊC and equilibrated in 20% su-
crose/PBS overnight at 4ЊC. They were immersed in Tissue Tek,
quick frozen on dry ice, and stored at Ϫ80ЊC until ready for use.
Serial cryosections (10 ␮m) were treated in 100% cold acetone
for 10 min, washed three times with PBS (0.05% Tween),
blocked with 0.5% BSA and 50% vol/vol Avidin D block solu-
tion (Vector Laboratories) for 15 min, washed three times,
blocked with Biotin blocking solution (Vector Laboratories) for
15 min, and washed three times. Subsequently, sections were in-
cubated with a biotin-conjugated anti-CD34 (clone RAM34;
BD Biosciences) diluted 1:50 in 1% BSA/0.05% Tween/PBS at
room temperature for 1 h, washed three times, incubated with
the detection reagent Streptavidin-Cy5 (Rockland) diluted 1:500
in 1% BSA/0.05% Tween/PBS at room temperature for 30 min,
washed three times, dehydrated in ethanol (from 70 to 100%),
and mounted with vectashield (Vector Laboratories).
Confocal images were taken of every tenth section starting
caudally at the point where the urogenital ridges first appeared up
to the rostral bifurcation of the dorsal aorta.
5-Fluorouracil Treatment. GATA-2ϩ/ϩ and GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ mice
(9–10 wk old) were i.v. injected with 150 mg 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU; Sigma-Aldrich) per 10 g body weight. Treated mice were
then killed at 4, 8, 12, and 16 d posttreatment, and BM cells were
isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry and in vitro culture assay.
Progenitor Colony Assay. BM cells were plated in triplicates
from 2 ϫ 104 to 5 ϫ 105 cells per plate in methylcellulose medium
(Methocult GF M3434; StemCell Technologies Inc.) supple-
mented with stem cell factor (SCF), IL-3, IL-6, and Epo. All cul-
tures were incubated at 37ЊC in a humidified chamber under 5%
CO2. Colony-forming unit–granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM)
were scored with an inverted microscope at day 7 of the culture.
Results
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGM and YS Explants Contain Fewer CFU-
S11. To investigate if GATA-2 gene dosage affects the
production of hematopoietic progenitors during develop-
ment, colony-forming unit spleen activity was assayed at
11 d postinjection (CFU-S11) so as to measure the more
immature erythro-myeloid progenitors. AGM, YS, and FL
were isolated from GATA-2ϩ/ϩ and GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ embryos
at E10.5–E12, explant cultured, and cells transplanted into
irradiated adult recipients (Fig. 1). At all time points tested,
CFU-S11 activity was detected both in GATA-2ϩ/ϩ and
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGM, YS, and FL explants (Fig. 2). As ex-
pected from previous data (3), high numbers of E10.5
CFU-S11 are first detected in the GATA-2ϩ/ϩ AGM ex-
plants, they increase at E11, and thereafter decline in num-
ber. In GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGM and YS explants, CFU-S11
were reduced by three- to ninefold and one- to fourfold,
respectively, compared with wild-type tissues. In contrast,
CFU-S11 activity in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ FL explants was normal.
No reductions in FL CFU-S11 numbers were observed at
any time. Therefore, GATA-2 gene dosage affects the
generation and/or proliferation of immature hematopoi-
etic progenitor cells in the YS and AGM of the midgesta-
tion embryo.
HSC Activity Is Severely Reduced in the GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ
AGMs. To investigate if GATA-2 dose also affects mid-
gestation HSC development, we performed the most strin-
gent functional HSC test: the long-term, high level, multi-
lineage repopulation of irradiated adult mouse recipients.
E11 and E12 GATA-2ϩ/ϩ and GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGM, YS,
and FL cells were transplanted directly into irradiated
adult recipients (Fig. 1). Engraftment by GATA-2ϩ/ϩ and
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ cells was assayed by semiquantitative PCR
of the male Y chromosome–specific marker Ymt and the
GATA-2/NEO mutant allele (respectively) in recipient pe-
ripheral blood DNA at 4 mo posttransplantation. Only
those recipients showing Ͼ10% engraftment with donor-
marked cells were considered positive for high level repop-
ulation. PCR results of one representative experiment are
shown in Fig. 3. Briefly, each recipient received one-third
of the cells obtained from an individually prepared E12 tis-
sue (0.33 tissue equivalents). At 4 mo postinjection, prog-
eny of transplanted GATA-2ϩ/ϩ AGM cells were found in
the peripheral blood of five out of eight recipients (Ymt

cells in GATA-2 mutant embryonic tissues. GATA-2ϩ/ϩ, GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ,
and GATA-2Ϫ/Ϫ AGM regions, YS, and FL were harvested from midgesta-
tion mouse embryos. In some cases (left) they were then cultured for 3 d
as whole tissue explants before preparation of single cell suspensions and
injection into irradiated adult recipients to assay for CFU-S11 or HSCs. In
some cases (right), single cell suspensions were prepared directly from
freshly isolated tissues and injected into irradiated adult recipients for
HSC activity.

PCR). In contrast, reduced HSC activity was found in E12
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGMs. Only one out of six recipients was
highly engrafted (GATA-2 mutant and Ymt PCR). Simi-
larly, recipients transplanted with YS cells revealed some
reduction of HSC activity in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ embryos. How-
ever, no reduction in HSC activity was found in GATA-
2ϩ/Ϫ FLs. Further analysis of recipients repopulated with
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ cells revealed high level multilineage engraft-
ment within all hematopoietic tissues (blood, thymus, LNs,
BM, and spleen) and subsets tested (splenic T and B lym-
phocytes, erythroid and myeloid cells) (not depicted).
The cumulative results of all transplantation experiments
are shown in Table I and reveal that at both E11 and E12,
HSC activity is severely reduced in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGMs.
The percentage of recipients repopulated with E11 GATA-
2ϩ/Ϫ AGM cells is only 6%, whereas 25% of recipients are
repopulated with E11 GATA-2ϩ/ϩ AGM cells. This repre-
sents a greater than fourfold decrease in HSC activity in
E11 GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGMs. Furthermore, at E12 GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ
AGMs are ninefold reduced in HSC activity compared
with GATA-2ϩ/ϩ AGMs. Reductions in the HSC activity
of GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ YS and FL tissues are less severe and stage
dependent. The percentage of mice repopulated by E11
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ YS (23%) is comparable to that of GATA-2ϩ/ϩ
YS (28%), and the FL at this stage contains only limited
HSC activity. However, at E12 slight reductions in HSC

contained Ͼ60 sp. *Significant difference in the CFU-S11 number between GATA-2ϩ/ϩ and GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ tissue explants: AGM E11.0, P Ͻ 0.001;

explants in comparison to the GATA-2ϩ/ϩ explants, whereas the FL CFU-S11 numbers are unaffected.

from E12 GATA-2ϩ/ϩ and ϩ/Ϫ tissues, respectively. Each sample
was analyzed with primers specific for Y chromosome (ymt),
and GATA-2 (GATA-2/NEO for targeted allele). DNA samples
were normalized by PCR with two endogenous gene controls
(myo, myogenin; GATA-2, wild-type allele). Control DNA: 0,

DNA mixed with female DNA. Only when the donor

activity are observed for both GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ YS and FL (1.6-
and 1.3-fold, respectively) compared with GATA-2ϩ/ϩ tis-
sues. Thus, two copies of the GATA-2 gene are required
for the normal generation, expansion, and/or survival of
HSCs in the AGM region.
Ex Vivo Expansion and Maintenance of AGM HSC Activity
Is Sensitive to GATA-2 Dose. Since it was shown previ-
ously that HSC activity generated in the AGM can be am-
plified (either by induction or proliferation) when whole
tissues are cultured for 3 d (3), we examined the effects of
GATA-2 gene dosage on HSCs in such explant cultures of
AGM, YS, and FL from GATA-2ϩ/ϩ and GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ
embryos. Tissues (E10.5–E12) were dissected, cultured as
explants for 3 d, made into a single cell suspension, and in-
jected into irradiated adult recipients (Fig. 1). Repopula-
tion was measured at 4 mo posttransplantation, and only
those recipients showing Ͼ10% donor cell multilineage he-
matopoietic repopulation (measured in several hematopoi-
etic tissues and lineages) were considered positive. The re-
sults are summarized in Table II.
Compared with the results of the direct transplantation
experiments (Table I), GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGM explants were
even more severely reduced in the HSC activity. At E10.5,
only 8% of recipients receiving GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGM cells
were repopulated, representing an eightfold decrease in
HSC activity from GATA-2ϩ/ϩ AGM cells. The GATA-
2ϩ/Ϫ cell contribution to the various hematopoietic organs
(thymus, spleen, LN, and BM) and purified cell lineages (B
and T lymphocytes, myeloid and erythroid) was tested and
found to be multipotent, thus demonstrating that GATA-
2ϩ/Ϫ AGMs do generate functional HSCs, albeit at much
reduced levels. At later developmental time points (E11,
E11.5, and E12), HSC activity, although increasing in
GATA-2ϩ/ϩ AGM explants, is completely absent from
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGM explants. As seen in the GATA-2ϩ/ϩ
AGM explants, HSC generation and expansion occurs from

(E12). Thus, the severely reduced HSC activity in GATA-
2ϩ/Ϫ AGM explants can be attributed to reduced HSC ex-
pansion, survival, and/or homing in the irradiated recipient.
The HSC activity of GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ YS and FL explants
was also reduced in comparison to the GATA-2ϩ/ϩ ex-
plants. However, this reduction was only slight compared
with the AGM. At the first appearance of HSCs in the YS
on E11, GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ YS HSC activity begins to decrease
and by E12 is decreased by 1.8-fold from GATA-2ϩ/ϩ YS.
The decrease in YS explant HSC activity at E12 corre-
sponds with that seen in the directly transplanted YS, sug-
gesting that the expansion but not the maintenance of YS
HSC activity is sensitive to GATA-2 dose.
Similarly, we observed slight reductions in the HSC ac-
tivity of GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ FL explants. At the first appearance
of HSCs in FL explants on E11.5, HSC activity is reduced
from 24% of recipients repopulated with GATA-2ϩ/ϩ cells
to 11% repopulated with GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ cells, representing a
2.2-fold decrease in HSC activity. At E12, GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ FL
explants show a 1.7-fold decrease in HSC activity. The
changes in FL HSC activity with time are most likely re-
lated to the numbers of incoming HSCs from the AGM
and YS. Thus, these findings suggest GATA-2 dose affects
the expansion but not the survival of HSCs in the FL.
The Onset of HSC Activity in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ Embryos Is
Normal. Previously, we reported CFU-S11 and HSC defi-
ciencies in embryos with a haploid dose of the runx1 tran-
scription factor (20). The spatial distribution of HSC activ-
ity was altered and an unexpected early appearance of HSC
activity was found in runx1ϩ/Ϫ AGM and YS. To examine
if there was also a premature appearance of HSC activity in
GATA-2 mutant embryos, AGM and YS explants from
early E10 (31–35 somite pairs) GATA-2ϩ/ϩ, GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ,
and GATA-2Ϫ/Ϫ embryos were isolated, cultured for 3 d,
and cells were transplanted into irradiated adult recipients.
As shown in Table II, although high tissue equivalents (up
to five) of cells from GATA-2 mutant (ϩ/Ϫ and Ϫ/Ϫ)
AGM and YS explants were injected, HSC activity was not
detected in any of the recipients. Also, GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ E10.5
YS and E10.5 and E11 FL explants showed no HSC activ-
ity. However, HSC activity initiates normally in GATA-
2ϩ/Ϫ AGM explants at E10.5 at the same stage as in the
GATA-2ϩ/ϩ AGM. HSCs also appear at normal time
points in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ YS and FL explants (E11 and E11.5,
respectively). Therefore, we conclude that HSC induction
initiates on schedule and that there is no early onset of
HSC activity in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGM, YS, or FL.
Serial Transplantation Potential of Midgestation HSCs Is Se-
verely Reduced. HSC self-renewal can be tested by serial
transplantation of HSCs from primary to secondary recipi-
ents. Since we found that GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGM HSCs are se-
verely reduced in their expansion, we examined whether
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ embryo-derived HSCs are as potent in their
serial repopulation ability as wild-type HSCs. Whole BM
cells from primary recipient mice showing high donor con-
tribution from transplanted E12 GATA-2ϩ/ϩ or GATA-
2ϩ/Ϫ AGM, YS, and FL cells were injected into irradiated
secondary adult recipients. Consistent with previous pub-
lished results, GATA-2ϩ/ϩ AGM-, YS-, and FL-derived
HSCs can successfully reconstitute secondary recipients;
100% of secondary recipients were repopulated with HSCs
from primary recipients of these midgestation tissues (Table
I). In contrast, HSCs from a primary GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGM
recipient failed to repopulate any of the secondary recipi-
ents analyzed (0%; zero out of three). Reduced HSC activ-
ity was also observed in the secondary recipients receiving
BM cells from GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ YS and FL primary recipients
(44% compared with 100% recipient repopulation with
GATA-2ϩ/ϩ primary BM cells). These results demonstrate
that GATA-2 dose affects HSC serial repopulation ability
and suggests a defect in HSC self-renewal.
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ BM HSCs Are at a Competitive Disadvan-
tage. The decreased serial repopulation ability of embryo-
derived HSCs prompted us to investigate if adult BM HSCs
are also affected by a reduction in GATA-2 dose. Initially,
we injected limiting doses of GATA-2ϩ/ϩ and GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ
BM cells into lethally irradiated adult recipients but found

cells were transplanted into sublethally irradiated

HSC competition in repopulation. The y axis

no quantitative differences in repopulation. Hence, we per-
formed reciprocal competitive transplantations in which dif-
ferent concentrations of unmanipulated GATA-2ϩ/ϩ and
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ BM cells were injected into sublethally irradi-
ated GATA-2ϩ/ϩ and GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ adult recipients.
When 3 ϫ 105 whole GATA-2ϩ/ϩ BM cells were trans-
planted into GATA-2ϩ/ϩ adult recipients, long-term high
level donor contribution was found in two out of five
(40%) recipients, whereas GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ cells at this dose
provided no repopulation (zero out of five recipients; 0%)
(Fig. 4). Only at a 10-fold higher cell dose were the
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ cells able to repopulate four out of seven
(57%) recipients. A dose of 3 ϫ 106 GATA-2ϩ/ϩ cells re-
populated almost all recipients (six out of seven; 86%),
whereas 3 ϫ 107 GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ cells were required for re-
population of all recipients (five out of five; 100%). To fur-
ther examine the competitive abilities of GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ cells,
GATA-2ϩ/ϩ cells were injected into sublethally irradiated
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ recipients. Only 3 ϫ 105 (or fewer) wild-type
cells were required to fully out-compete all the GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ
HSCs in the recipients. Thus, GATA-2ϩ/ϩ HSCs compete
more effectively against GATA-2ϩ/ϩ HSCs than do
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ HSCs, demonstrating that GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ adult
BM contains fewer HSCs or that these HSCs are qualita-
tively less potent.
GATA-2 Dose Affects the Number of Phenotypically Defined
HSCs in the Embryo But Not the Adult. Our in vivo trans-
plantation results clearly show that GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ HSC ac-
tivity is affected throughout development. To more specif-
ically investigate the cell types that are affected in the
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ mice, we crossed the GATA-2 mutant allele
into Ly-6A GFP transgenic mice, in which HSCs can be
detected by the expression of the green fluorescent protein
(GFP) reporter under the transcriptional control of Ly-6A
regulatory sequences (26). Ly-6A encodes the Sca-1 surface
glycoprotein that is expressed on HSCs. Previously, we
have shown that all AGM, FL, and adult BM HSCs express
the Ly-6A GFP transgene and that GFP expression is
highly restricted in the AGM region to a few aortic endo-
thelial cells and hematopoietic clusters (23, 27).
To determine whether GATA-2 dose affects these cells,
we examined transverse sections through the E11 dorsal
aorta from compound transgenics (Ly-6A GFP–GATA-
2ϩ/ϩ and Ly-6A GFP–GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ). As shown in repre-
sentative sections in Fig. 5 A, GFP-positive cells are de-
creased in number in the GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ aorta compared
with the GATA-2ϩ/ϩ aorta. Quantitations were performed
by counting GFP-positive and CD34-positive cells in 37
aorta sections from each genotype (CD34 immunostaining
of endothelial cells provided a normalization control). GFP-
positive cells were present but decreased by a factor of 10
or more in the GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ aortas. Hence, GATA-2 hap-
loinsufficiency leads to a significant decrease in HSCs and/
or HSC precursors in the AGM.
Flow cytometric analyses were performed to verify these
results and to examine if the phenotypic HSC content of
the other hematopoietic tissues was also changed. As shown
in Fig. 5 B, in such compound transgenic embryos a sixfold
decrease in GFP-positive cells in the E11 GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ
aorta was found compared with GATA-2ϩ/ϩ aorta. E11
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ YS showed a 1.9-fold decrease in GFP-posi-
tive cells. However, no decrease was found in E11 GATA-

total, four embryos were analyzed (2 embryos and a

Flow cytometric analysis of phenotypically defined
HSCs was performed on (B) embryonic hemato-
poietic tissues and (C) adult BM. Expression of the
Ly-6A GFP HSC marker was analyzed on E11
aorta, YS, and FL cells. Adult BM cells were ana-
lyzed for the percentage of cells in the LinϪ fraction
that are Sca-1ϩc-kitϩ. Percentages of GFPϩ cells in
the embryonic tissue and Sca-1ϩc-kitϩ cells enclosed

2ϩ/Ϫ FL. Similarly, no difference in the percentages of
HSCs as defined by the LinϪSca-1ϩc-kitϩ (LSK) pheno-
type was found when GATA-2ϩ/ϩ and GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ adult
BM was analyzed (Fig. 5 C). Together, these phenotypic
data support the transplantation data in showing that HSCs
are quantitatively decreased in the AGM but that HSCs in-
crease to normal numbers in the FL and adult BM.
Cytotoxic Drug Treatment Reveals a Proliferation Defect in
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ BM HSCs. To test if the qualitative defect
in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ HSCs is related to proliferation, GATA-
2ϩ/ϩ and GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ mice were treated with the cyto-
toxic drug 5-FU (28). At 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 d after treat-
ment, BM cells were tested in in vitro assays and analyzed
by flow cytometry for evidence of hematopoietic regenera-
tion. As shown in Fig. 6 A, both GATA-2ϩ/ϩ and GATA-
2ϩ/Ϫ mice showed similar reductions in total BM cell num-
ber at 4 d post 5-FU. Total BM cell numbers increased to
starting numbers by 16 d post–5-FU. No significant differ-
ences were observed between the number of total GATA-
2ϩ/ϩ and GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ BM cells at any time point. In addi-
tion, no defect in hematopoietic differentiation was
observed in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ BM cells, as flow cytometric
analysis showed the presence of all three lineages, lym-
phoid, myeloid, and erythroid at similar levels in GATA-
2ϩ/ϩ and GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ BM (not depicted).
To investigate whether specific immature hematopoietic
progenitors were affected in 5-FU–treated GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ mice,
we performed in vitro colony assays for CFU-GM. As
shown in Fig. 6, B and C, the starting frequency and number
of CFU-GM were the same in GATA-2ϩ/ϩ and GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ
BM. At 4 d post 5-FU treatment, frequency and number of
CFU-GM reached a similar low point in both GATA-2ϩ/ϩ
and GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ BM. However, at 12 d after 5-FU treat-
ment, CFU-GM frequency and number in GATA-2ϩ/ϩ
BM reached higher or the same levels as the untreated BM,
whereas the GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ BM CFU-GM frequency and
number remained low (P Ͻ 0.008 and 0.002, respectively).
Only at day 16 after 5-FU treatment did GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ CFU-
GM frequency and number reach the same levels as in un-
treated BM. Thus, the 4 d delay in the regeneration of
CFU-GM in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ BM suggests a GATA-2 dose–
related proliferation defect acting within these progenitors.
Alternatively, a GATA-2 dose–related proliferation defect
acts within HSCs and only secondarily influences CFU-GM.
To test this, we analyzed the regeneration of HSCs. We
performed flow cytometric analysis for LSK BM cells at 0, 4,
8, 12, and 16 d post–5-FU treatment. In both GATA-2ϩ/ϩ
and GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ BM, HSC percentages and absolute num-
bers were similarly reduced at 4 d post–5-FU treatment (Fig.
6, D and E). Both GATA-2ϩ/ϩ and GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ BM HSC
percentages and numbers began recovering at day 8 post–5-
FU, when they surpassed the initial percentages and num-
bers. However, GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ BM HSC numbers remained
significantly lower than in GATA-2ϩ/ϩ BM at both day 8

frequency of CFU-GM in 104 BM cells, and (C) the total
number of CFU-GM in the BM (two tibias plus two femurs).

and 12 post–5-FU treatment (p Ͻ 0.04). Furthermore,
whereas GATA-2ϩ/ϩ HSC numbers peaked at day 12 post-
treatment and declined thereafter, GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ HSC num-
bers increased slowly up to day 16 post–5-FU treatment.
The finding that HSC expansion in 5-FU–treated GATA-
2ϩ/Ϫ mice is delayed by at least 4 d strongly suggests a
GATA-2 dose–dependent proliferation defect in HSCs.
Discussion
The data presented here show for the first time that a full
dose of GATA-2 is required during embryonic and adult
stages for quantitatively and qualitatively normal HSC ac-
tivity in vivo. Although HSCs are most likely not produced
in GATA-2Ϫ/Ϫ embryos, the effects of GATA-2 haplo-
insufficiency had been largely unexplored because such
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ animals grow normally and present an overtly
normal adult hematologic profile. Here we have shown
that with only half the dose of GATA-2, HSC numbers are
severely and specifically reduced in the AGM region,
where the first induction and expansion of HSCs is occur-
ring during midgestation. Moreover, AGM HSC quality is
compromised. Thereafter, in the other tissues harboring
HSCs, quantitative deficiencies in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ HSCs ap-
pear to be compensated through normal (albeit delayed)
expansion of HSCs, but qualitative deficiencies are retained
through to adulthood. Therefore, given that only a few
HSCs out of the whole cohort of HSCs are actively con-
tributing to the hematopoietic system at any one time (29,
30) and that GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ cells are not defective in differen-
tiation, no general hematologic defects would be expected
in haploinsufficient adults. Only through stringent in vivo
transplantations or cytotoxic stress are HSC functional de-
fects observable. The results of these experiments strongly
suggest an essential role for GATA-2 in the induction and
expansion of the first HSCs in the AGM and an additional,
distinctive role for GATA-2 in the proliferation of HSCs.
HSC Quantitative Processes Are Altered in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ
Mice. In in vivo transplantation experiments we show
quantitatively reduced HSC activity in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ em-
bryos. The four- to ninefold decrease in HSC activity in
E11/E12 GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGMs compared with GATA-2ϩ/ϩ
AGMs is the consequence of fewer HSCs, as aorta sections
and flow cytometric analysis show a sixfold decrease in
phenotypically defined HSCs. Hence, GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGMs
can neither expand nor maintain HSCs compared with
GATA-2ϩ/ϩ AGMs. In contrast, HSCs are expanded and
maintained in E11/E12 GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ YS (at a slightly de-
creased number), with the fold decrease in phenotypically
defined HSCs in the YS corresponding closely to the fold
decrease in HSC activity. Considering the fact that HSCs
are first detected in the AGM region and then in the YS
and FL, the reduced HSC content of the GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ YS
and FL may well be a secondary effect of the reduction in
the GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGM region.
Our in vivo analyses for hematopoietic progenitor cells
in the AGM region and the YS show that CFU-S11 are also
GATA-2 dose dependent. These data are consistent with
previous in vitro studies on GATA-2Ϫ/Ϫ YS and ES cells
(13, 31), showing much reduced hematopoietic progenitor
activity. The reduced CFU-S11 activity in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ
AGMs and YSs could further be a consequence of the re-
duced HSC activity we detected in these tissues. However,
the source of cells providing the CFU-S11 activity in the
embryo is not clear. Whereas in the adult, hematopoietic
progenitor cells are derived from HSCs, in the preE10.5
AGM region and the YS they may be derived from he-
mangioblasts and/or hemogenic endothelium rather than
via a HSC ancestor. Hence, GATA-2 may act directly on
the in vivo generation, survival, and/or expansion of the
hematopoietic progenitor cells, HSCs, and/or their direct
precursors in the AGM and YS.
The YS as a Compensatory Generator of HSCs Independent
of GATA-2 Dose. For over three decades, the origins of
adult HSCs have been a focus of research. The view that
the mammalian YS is able to provide hematopoietic cells
that migrate and colonize the FL and then the BM during
the neonatal/adult stages has been altered by the finding
that the first fully functional adult HSCs are autonomously
generated in the AGM region. Shortly thereafter, the YS
contains HSCs, but due to the experimental constraints of
mammalian embryos, it is difficult to definitively demon-
strate whether these HSCs are AGM derived or autono-
mously generated in the YS. Recent data suggest that in-
deed YS can autonomously generate and expand HSCs (6)
and putative pre-HSCs (32). Since we observe a dramatic
reduction of HSCs in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGMs but only a slight
reduction of HSCs in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ YSs, our transplantation
data support the notion of YS HSC generation potential
(albeit in a GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ embryo). However, since HSCs
are still generated in the GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGM 1 d earlier than
in the YS, it remains possible that YS HSCs are AGM
derived. Interestingly, the reduced HSC activity in the
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ YS can be expanded to a magnitude compa-
rable to that of the GATA-2ϩ/ϩ YS in explant cultures,
suggesting that at least some of the reduced activity in the
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ YS is a secondary effect of the reduction of
HSCs in the AGM. Furthermore, GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ HSC num-
bers are compensated to normal levels in the adult, possibly
due to HSC generation and expansion in the YS and the
further expansion in the FL and BM. Notwithstanding,
these data imply that the underlying molecular mechanisms
in which the AGM generates, maintains, and expands
HSCs are different from that of the YS. The AGM region
is exquisitely sensitive to the level of the GATA-2 dose,
whereas the YS is much less sensitive. Hence, the HSC de-
fects in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGMs do not result in severe anemia
in adults since GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ YS can generate and/or ex-
pand sufficient HSCs irrespective of the haploinsufficiency.
HSC Qualitative Processes Are Altered in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ
Mice. The results of adult BM competitive transplantation
experiments clearly demonstrate a qualitative difference be-
tween the GATA-2ϩ/ϩ and GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ HSCs. The high
percentage of GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ mice engrafted with GATA-
Role of GATA-2 in Hematopoietic Stem Cells880
2ϩ/ϩ cells, even at low donor cell numbers, demonstrate
that GATA-2ϩ/ϩ BM HSCs have a proliferative advantage
over the GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ BM HSCs. In the reciprocal trans-
plantation in which GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ BM cells were trans-
planted into GATA-2ϩ/ϩ recipients, high numbers of cells
were needed to obtain a high percentage of donor-engrafted
recipient mice and thus imply that: (a) the number of
HSCs in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ BM is quantitatively reduced; (b) the
GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ HSCs have a lower proliferative advantage
over the GATA-2ϩ/ϩ HSCs; and/or (c) the homing effi-
ciency is lower for GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ–derived HSCs. The fact
that no significant difference in the percentage or absolute
number of LSK BM cells was found between GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ
and wild-type BM indicates that the decreased HSC activ-
ity is not due to a quantitative decrease in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ BM
HSCs. However, the delayed expansion of HSCs in the
5-FU recovery experiments does strongly suggest that the
major GATA-2 dose-dependent defect is in HSC prolifera-
tion. Although homing of HSCs is not required in this
experimental scenario, we cannot exclude an additional
GATA-2 dose–dependent defect in homing.
How Does GATA-2 Dose Affect the Quantitative and Qual-
itative Development of HSCs? We propose here that the
GATA-2 dose effects we observe in the AGM act at the
level of the hemogenic cells that differentiate into HSCs.
Normally, a full dose of GATA-2 is required for the gener-
ation, maintenance, and/or expansion of these precursor
cells. In the haploinsufficient AGM region, these he-
mogenic cells fail to differentiate, survive, and/or divide.
However, owing to the stochastic nature of gene expres-
sion, some hemogenic cells still achieve a threshold level of
GATA-2 protein, and therefore, the target genes (which
are needed for the differentiation, survival and/or division
of the precursor cells) can be activated at some low fre-
quency in the E10.5 AGM. The outcome of GATA-2
haploinsufficiency is then a small production of HSCs fol-
lowed by an overall reduction in the absolute number of
AGM HSCs that we can detect functionally in our trans-
plantation assay and phenotypically in immunostained sec-
tions and flow cytometry analysis.
Recent GATA-2 expression data in the AGM support
the notion of a role for GATA-2 in hemogenic precursors.
Transgenic embryos with a GFP marker under the control
of GATA-2 transcriptional regulatory sequences show high
levels of GATA-2 expression in CD45Ϫ AGM cells with
hemogenic potential and a significant decrease in the per-
centage of CD45ϩ cells in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ E11.5 AGMs (12).
Moreover, during midgestation, at the time of the first in-
duction of HSCs, GATA-2 is expressed in the endothelial
cells lining the dorsal aorta and some underlying mesenchy-
mal cells. Hence, high GATA-2 expression in hemogenic
cells of the AGM suggests that GATA-2 is acting on the
cells just immediately preceding the induction of HSCs.
Since GATA-2 is a transcription factor, its target genes
within hemogenic AGM cells are of particular interest. Sev-
eral markers of AGM HSCs and aortic hemogenic cells
have been recently described: the Ly-6A (Sca-1) cell surface
glycoprotein (23, 33) and Runx-1 transcription factor (27).
These molecules are overlapping with GATA-2 in their ex-
pression patterns in hemogenic cells of the dorsal aorta.
Targeted mutation of these genes results in qualitative and/
or quantitative defects in HSCs. Whereas Ly-6AϪ/Ϫ em-
bryos thrive into adulthood with no or little effect on HSC
generation in the embryo, functional analyses of HSCs de-
rived from Ly-6AϪ/Ϫ mutant BM show defects in their self-
renewal ability (34), similar to our findings in GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ
BM. In contrast, runx-1Ϫ/Ϫ embryos are completely devoid
of HSCs and exhibit FL anemia leading to lethality at E12
(35–37). Moreover, runx-1 haploinsufficiency leads to a
premature extinction of AGM HSCs (20). Hence, the Ly-
6A and runx-1 genes could be targets of GATA-2 or, alter-
natively, contribute to the activation of the same pathways
for HSC self-renewal and/or HSC generation. At present,
although many GATA consensus-binding sites appear in
the sequences surrounding these genes, there is no in vivo
data showing that any of these sites are functional.
Nonetheless, two bona fide target genes of GATA-2
have been proposed. These are SCL/tal-1, an essential early
hematopoietic transcription factor and E4bp4, a transcrip-
tion factor implicated in cell survival. In vivo studies show
that GATA-2 forms a multiprotein complex with Fli-1 and
Elf-1 that binds the SCL enhancer and activates the expres-
sion in HSCs, endothelial cells, and their bipotent progeni-
tor, the hemangioblast (38). However, in vivo mutation
analysis on the HSC-specific GATA sites within the SCL
locus affects SCL expression not only in the AGM but also
in YS and FL (38). Therefore, it is unlikely that the selec-
tive defect in the GATA-2ϩ/Ϫ AGM HSCs can be attrib-
uted to defective SCL expression. Chromatin immunopre-
cipitation studies on BaF3 cell line stimulated with IL-3
show that GATA-2 binds to a sequence downstream of the
transcriptional start site of E4bp4 and is necessary for tran-
scriptional activation of this gene (39). Considering that IL-3
is a survival factor for HSCs, it is plausible that GATA-2 is
involved in the activation of this pathway.
In conclusion, GATA-2 dosage is important in regula-
tion of HSC production and expansion. Haploinsufficiency
of GATA-2 results in quantitative decreases in HSCs in the
AGM and qualitative defects in HSCs in both the embry-
onic-derived and adult BM HSCs. The pivotal importance
of GATA-2 in these processes within HSCs now awaits the
identification of the relevant target genes and the functional
cascades that GATA-2 activates, most likely in concert
with other factors in multiprotein complexes.
