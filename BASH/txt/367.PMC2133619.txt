THE EFFECT OF DIET ON THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF
THE CANINE HEMATOPOIETIC FUNCTION TO
DAMAGE BY AMIDOPYRINE

(Fromthe Hospital of The RockefellerInstitutefor MedicalResearch)
PLATE 10
(Received for publication, May 29, 1937)
The association of amidopyrine administration with the occurrence
of acute agranulocytosis in human beings has been pointed out in a
number of communications (1-4). However, attempts to confirm
by experimentation the hypothesis of a toxic effect of amidopyrine
on hematopoiesis have failed signally. Although in rare instances a
decrease in the number of circulating granulocytes has been reported
to follow the administration of amidopyrine to animals, such results
have been so irregular as to throw serious doubt on the rSle of the
drug as an inhibitor of blood formation.
Miller (5) and Climenko (6) have published evidence that in animals
fed amidopyrine in solution, histological examination of the bone
marrow discloses definite pathological changes even though no marked
decrease in the numbers of granulocytes in the circulating blood is
present. Miller and Rhoads (7), in a study of the hematological
changes associated with acute black tongue in dogs, reported that the
acute stomatitis was occasionally associated with a decreased number
of granulocytes in the peripheral blood. Histological studies of bone
marrow removed at the height of the granulopenia revealed a relative
decrease of mature hematopoietic elements. The change observed
presented certain similarities to the pathological alteration of the
bone marrow in acute granulopenia of man.
In the case of acute stomatitis and granulopenia of the dog, the
etiology is apparent; it is the feeding of a particular diet. In acute
granulopenia of man the pathological changes are in certain respects
similar to those of the dog, but the cause is obscure although amido-
367
368 DAM_AGE BY AMIDOPYRIN-E TO IIEM_ATOPOEETIC EUNCTION
pyrine administration appears to play some part. It seemed possible
then, that a faulty dietary might well be one factor at least which
increased the susceptibility to the toxic effect of amidopyrine. To
substantiate this hypothesis experiment should prove that a dose of
amidopyrine which is ineffective alone will cause a well defined dis-
turbance of hematopoiesis when it is added to a diet which is not by
itself causative of symptoms. Such experiments have been performed,
but paradoxically, the resulting disturbance of the circulating blood
cells manifested itself in the erythrocytes rather than in the leuko-
cytes. The results are reported in this communication.
The experiments dealing with the effects of aromatic compounds on
hematopoiesis have been reviewed recently in detail by Hamilton (8)
and by Kracke (9) and need no discussion here. It suffices to state
that the picture of progressive anemia, entirely similar to aplastic
anemia in man, has not been encountered. Sudden and severe de-
creases in number of white cells have been the rule. This last fact
led Kracke (1) to suggest that the r61e of amidopyrine in granulopenia
was one similar to that of benzol in the blood dyscrasias which are
due to that chemical.
The part played by diet in controlling the susceptibility of individ-
uals to poisoning by aromatic compounds was suggested by studies
of trinitrotoluol poisoning in Great Britain during the World War (10).
Furthermore, Biberfeld (11) had observed that an inadequate dietary
rendered rabbits susceptible to poisoning by amounts of methol which
were non-toxic to animals fed a normal diet.
Methods
The animals employed were mongrel dogs of about 7 kilos in average weight.
They were kept under standard conditions in individual cages with bedding of
wood shavings.
The so called normal diet was one which is fed as routine; and empirically is
known to be capable of maintaining dogsin goodhealth over a period of several
years. It is a mixture of cookedbeef, bread, and dog biscuit. The black tongue
diet was that described by Goldberger (12). It is known to cause acute black
tongue when fed, without supplement, for a period of from 5 to 10 weeks. In an
extensive study the feedingof this diet has never been known to cause symptoms
in previously normal dogs after a shorter interval. The diet was composedof the
followingingredients.

The corn meal, peas, and casein were mixed and cooked for 2 hours in a steam
cooker. The remaining ingredients were then added and thoroughly mixed.
The dogs were fed daily and were allowed to eat as much as they chose.
Blood was taken from the jugular vein in a standard amount of potassium
oxalate for routine examinations. Determinations of the number of erythrocytes
and leukocytes were made in standard pipettes and counting chambers. The
hemoglobin was estimated by the Sahli method, employing a glass standard.
The Sahli tubes were carefully calibrated and checked at frequent intervals by
the O2-combining capacity method of Van Slyke (13).
The amidopyrine used was lot 1,433, manufactured by the H. A. Metz Labora-
tories, New York. It was administered by stomach tube in a 5 per cent solution
in water. Mild heating was required to effect a solution of that strength.
General Results
The effect of the administration of 0.5 gin. of amidopyrine daily was
tested on two groups of dogs. One group of 12 was fed the Gold-
berger black tongue diet and the other group of 3 received the normal
diet. In the first group (Table I), severe ulcerative stomatitis and
profound anemia appeared between the 2nd and 9th weeks of treat-
ment in 9. Three dogs, Nos. 2, 11, and 12, failed to develop severe
anemia. Anorexia, loss of weight, and diarrhea were marked features.
No striking granulopenia was observed. The bone marrows of the
animals which died revealed a suppression of hematopoietic maturation.
In the control group of animals (Table II) which were subjected to the
370 DAMAGE BY AMIDOPYRINE TO HEMATOPOIETIC FUNCTION
same medication but were fed the normal diet, no symptoms resulted.
The experiment was repeated, employing larger doses of amidopyrine
(Tables III and IV). Both stomatifis and anemia were severe in the
animals fed the black tongue diet, but in those fed the normal diet
only a mild anemia resulted. No distinct granulopenia occurred at
any time in any experimental animal although histological study of
the bone marrows of the animals which died showed a well defined
interferencewith maturation of both red and white cells.
Anemia
The fall of erythrocyte levels was rapid in those animals in which
anemia occurred. In the group fed amidopyrineplus the diet produc-
ing black tongue, the anemia was profound, the erythrocyte count in
some instances reaching 50 per cent or less of the original level. In
general, the fall of hemoglobinlevels paralleled the fall in erythrocytes,
giving a color index which is approximately normal for the dog.
Marked variation in size and shape of erythrocyteswas a feature at the
height of the anemia. Reticulocyte counts were not done. There
was no increase in the bilirubin content of the serum as indicated by
the icterus index.
Stomatitis
The stomatitis appearing in those dogs fed the black tongue diet
supplemented by amidopyrine was somewhat similar to that seen
when the diet alone was fed for a longer period of time. The first
manifestation was a marked dusky red coloration of the entire oral
and pharyngeal mucous membrane. Mter a short time, small, dis-
crete ulcerations appeared, most frequently just anterior to the
pharyngeal pillars. These showed a base covered by yellow necrotic
material and a raised, injected margin. At this stage, salivation was
severe. In some instances the ulceration remained localized, and in
others it progressed until multiple, coalescent lesions were present and
were covered by a membrane of necrotic material. The loss of tissue
was more severe, though more localized, than that seen in most in-
stances of black tongue due to feeding alone.

Pathological Changes of the Bone Marrow
In Figs. 1 and 2 are shown low and high power photomicrographs of
the bone marrow of dog 3, which developed severe anemia and died
following the combination of feeding the black tongue diet and the
daily administration of 0.5 gin. of amidopyrine. Similar changes
were seen in other animals which died.
The normal arrangement of femoral bone marrow in the dog is
almost completely obliterated. Instead of well defined islands of
orderly hematopoiesis, the cells are scattered irregularly throughout
the marrow tissue (compare with Fig. 3 which shows normal canine,
femoral marrow). There is a striking suppression of maturation,
particularly as concerns the cells of the erythropoietic series. Normo-
blasts and late erythroblasts are almost completely absent. A very
definite increase in young cells has taken place as shown by the pres-
ence of many undifferentiated forms which vary somewhat in size.
The most common one is a small, round cell with a small amount of
basophilic cytoplasm and a deeply staining nucleus containing a very
large amount of chromatin. This is held to be the primitive erythro-
poietic cell of Sabin (14). Various modifications of the primitive cell
are present; some have more cytoplasm and a looser arrangement of
nuclear chromatin. All of the stages in development up to that of the
erythroblast are represented but only a few examples of more mature
red cells are at hand.
An interference with the maturation of the granulocytes is less
marked but is definite, in spite of the absence of granulopenia in the
circulating blood. Granular leukocytes and their precursors are pres-
ent in reduced numbers in the marrow. Furthermore, they show
well defined evidence of damage as indicated by pyknosis of nuclei,
abnormal size and shape, and irregular staining. No interference with
the megakaryocytes can be made out.
Experiment 1. Table I. Text-Fig. 1
In this experiment, 12 dogs fed the black tongue diet received 0.5
gm. of amidopyrine daily. The results can best be seen by examina-
tion of the protocol of an animal which is typical of the series. It
should be noted that in this instance the oral lesions appeared in less
372 DAM.AGE BY AMIDOPYRINE TO HEM_ATOPOIETIC FUNCTION
than 10 days after the experimental diet feeding was begun, whereas
such changes have never been observed in this laboratory from diet
feeding alone before the 5th week.

anemia and one died. In the remaining 2, treatment was discontinued
and recovery ensued. One striking discrepancy between this experi-
ment and Experiment 1, in which only 0.5 gin. of amidopyrine was
administered daily, was observed. The animals receiving a smaller
amount of the drug all showed ulceration of the oral mucosa, whereas
those given a larger amount did not manifest that change. No
explanation is at hand for this difference.

Experiment 4. Table IV. Text-Fig. 4
This experiment served as a control on Experiment 3. 5 animals
were fed the normal diet and at the same time given 2 gin. of amidopy-
fine daily. The results are shown in Table IV. In contrast to the
animals of Experiment 2, which received the same diet but only 0.5
gin. of amidopyrine daily, those given the larger amount of the drug
did evince a definite fall in erythrocyte values. At no time, however,
were mouth lesions or evidence of gastro-intestinal tract involvement,
such as diarrhea, present. The animals continued to eat well and
remained in relatively good health. The grade of anemia encountered
in this group was not as severe as that seen in the animals fed the
black tongue diet. In further experiments of this type similar results
have been encountered. Whereas some depression of erythrocyte
levels can be caused by the prolonged administration of large amounts
of amidopyrine, it is irregular and of mild degree.

Experiment 5. Text-Fig. 5
As a supplement to the studies which have been described, this
experiment tested the effect of administering 0.5 gin. of amidopyrine
daily to 2 dogs over long periods of the feeding of both good and bad
diets.
The results are presented in Text-fig. 5. The administration of the
drug during a period of normal diet feedingwas without marked effect.
When the black tongue diet was fed and the drug administration was
continued, there was a pronounced decline of the blood values to low
levels. When vegex, a commercial yeast preparation, was adminis-
tered in amounts which wereknown to be effectivein the prevention of
black tongue, a remission of the anemia was effected. The blood was
maintained at levels approaching the normal as long as the vegex
supplement was continued, but fell when it was omitted. This was
true in spite of the fact that the amidopyrine administration was con-
tinued throughout the course of the study.
DISCUSSION
In the experiments reported, anemia was brought about in dogs fed
the black tongue diet by the administration of amounts of amidopy-
fine which were without effect when given to dogs fed a normal diet.
When sufficient amounts of the drag were administered to dogs fed
the normal diet, an anemia did result. It was not as severe as that
caused by administering amidopyrine to animals on the inadequate
diet and was not associated with stomatitis. Ulceration of the oral
and pharyngeal mucous membrane was a striking feature when arnido-
pyrine administration was combined with the inadequate diet. That
the anemia and stomatitis were not due to the diet alone is clear from
the fact that they occurred before they could be expected if only the
special diet was fed. Moreover, they were more severe than are the
changes of black tongue and were of a somewhat different character.
The absence of leukopenia was remarkable, particularly since it
would have been expected, at least in a mild degree, from the histolog-
ical appearance of the bone marrow. From this fact it would appear
that the action of amidopyrine is neither exactly that of benzol nor
of the black tongue diet alone. On the other hand, the toxic effect
380 DAMAGE BY AM/DOPYRINE TO HEMATOPOIETIC ~UNCTION
on the bone marrow of the administration of an aromatic compound is
so dependent upon such factors as dosage, diet, route of administra-
tion, and host susceptibility that it is difficult to prognosticate what
the effect will be in a given instance.
The histological alterations of the bone marrow were of particular
interest. They appeared to be similar to those described in a case of
benzol poisoning by Andersen (15) and also to those seen in several
cases of aplastic anemia studied in this laboratory in which no history
of exposure to benzol was available.
One aspect of the experiments deserves special consideration; the
fact that the combination of amidopyrine administration and the diet
feeding gave a pathological result not wholly dissimilar from that fol-
lowing a sufficientlylong period of the diet feeding alone. The stoma-
titis was similar to that of some cases of acute black tongue, though
different in minor details from most. Anemia of mild degree has been
reported to occur irregularly in recurrent, chronic black tongue by
Rhoads and Miller (16) and Spies (17). A suppression of maturation
of the hematopoietic elements of the bone marrow has been described
in both acute and chronic black tongue by the same authors. The
suggestion may be advanced that the factor in the diet which makes it
productive of black tongue is an aromatic compound or that the diet
renders the body incapable of detoxifying some aromatic compound,
either present in the diet or a product of intrinsic metabolic formation.
Further experiments dealing with this subject are in progress.
SLr~y AND CONCLUSION
i. By feeding dogs a black tongue diet and at the same time ad-
ministering amidopyrine, acute stomatitis and anemia may be pro-
duced.
2. Both stomatitis and anemia occur some time before they could
be expected to appear as result of the diet feeding alone.
3. The anemia is associated with suppression of maturation of the
hematopoietic bone marrow elements.
