The hypothesis is presented that a human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) or a related agent
produces a lytic response of T cells manifested by the acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS) and a proliferative response represented by the adult leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) syn-
dromes. The sequence or cascade of T-cell events following loss of T4 helper cells in AIDS in-
cludes reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus and a B-cell cascade of cytomegalovirus, resulting in
Kaposi sarcoma in genetically susceptible persons, and of other intracellular agents (CNS
viruses, M. avium intracellulari, T. gondii); opportunistic infections also occur. A comparison
of AIDS and ATL syndromes is presented and the details of the B-cell cascade are outlined.
The usefulness of prospective serological/immunological studies is discussed in an effort to
determine the temporal sequence of infection by the candidate agents and their relation to the
appearance of T4/T8 reversal and of the clinical features of AIDS.
A total of 3,000 cases and 1,283 deaths (43 percent) from the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) have been reported from 42 states, the District of
Columbia, and Puerto Rico from June 1981 to December 19, 1983 [1] that meet the
Centers for Disease Control definition. This does not include 42 children under
five years with an AIDS-like syndrome. Figure 1 presents the sequence of events as
recorded in periodic reports from the Centers for Disease Control up to June 1983.
The cause or causes of this syndrome are currently unknown, as is its pathogenesis
and the sequence of immunological events. This paper proposes that a human T-cell
leukemia-like virus is one cause of AIDS. The general concept is advanced that
HTLV infection of T4 lymphocytes and EBV infection of B lymphocytes can lead to
a proliferative or lytic response depending on the circumstances of infection, each of
which may lead to a cascade of secondary events. The possible consequences of
B-cell infection by EBV have been presented previously [2-5].
THE T-CELL CASCADE
The possibility of a virus capable of inducing a proliferative sequence in T
lymphocytes in humans was suggested by the lymphatic tumors produced in non-
human primates by Herpes ateles and H. saimiri viruses and in herpes infections of
other animals [6]. Two new developments suggest a T-cell retrovirus may cause
317
The concepts in this paper have arisen while working on EBV under research grants from the National
Institutes of Health, the most current of which is CA 30433.

disease in humans. First, investigators at the U.S. National Cancer Institute [7,8], as
well as Japanese workers [9,10], have demonstrated virological and antibody
evidence of a human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) in patients with human T-cell
leukemia or lymphomas and have defined its unusual epidemiological occurrence in
adults, in blacks and Japanese, and geographically in southern Japan, southern
U.S., and in the Caribbean islands. Antibody has been found in family contacts of
cases and in healthy persons in endemic areas [8,9]. Both the leukemia and the
presence of antibody in healthy persons are limited to adults, suggesting the
possibility of a sexually transmitted agent as in HSV-2. The second development is
the occurrence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in male
homosexuals, hemophiliacs, heroin and other drug users (including amyl nitrate),
and Haitians [11,12]. The high-risk group is expanding to include infants and
children in the families of AIDS patients, as well as recipients of their blood.
Epidemiologically, this suggests the possibility of spread by sexual activity, blood
and blood products, and by vertical transmission. These routes are similar to
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and raise concern about the potential spread of AIDS, as is
true of HBV, in nursery schools, daycare centers, prisons, recruit camps, and other
settings where close and prolonged contact and poor hygenic practices occur,
sometimes attended by drug use, or exposure to blood via bites or scratches, or

homosexual practices. Fortunately, no spread to hospital personnel or casual con-
tacts of AIDS patients has been reported. Probably the agent is not as contagious as
HBV in these circumstances. Immunologically, AIDS is characterized by a reversal
of the helper (OKT4): suppressor (OKT8) ratio [13]. Whether the primary event is a
decrease in helper cells, as might occur from the direct lytic effect of a virus, or an
early increase in suppressor and cytotoxic T cells which then leads to decreased
helper T cells is under study. Asymptomatic reversal of the helper: suppressor ratio
is common in homosexuals [13] but clinically severe and often fatal manifestations
appear which include Pneumocystis carinii, cerebral toxoplasmosis, Kaposi sar-
comas and B-cell lymphomas, and a wide variety of other opportunistic infections.
B lymphocytes are also involved in AIDS, as shown by an increased number of cells
secreting immunoglobulins and decreased B-cell proliferative responses to T-cell-
independent B-cell mitogens; this evidence is suggestive of an in vitro polyclonal ac-
tivation of B cells [14].
There is increasing interest in the possibility that some cases of AIDS are due to a
"new" virus or viruses capable of infecting T cells and possibly imported from the
Caribbean or Haiti. HTLV or a related agent is one good biological and geographic
candidate for the causative virus in AIDS; other causative agents may also exist.
Given a specific virus capable of infecting T cells, especially helper T cells, one can
imagine a sequence of events that could lead to the various manifestations of AIDS
and predict new ones. Figure 2 represents a hypothetical T-cell cascade. The concept
of a T-cell cascade was suggested by Pagano [15] and HTLV as a possible cause pro-
posed by Gellman and Gallo [16] at a recent meeting in New York City. HTLV ap-
parently infects helper cells preferentially [7]. As this essay is being completed, scien-
tific evidence supporting the possible role of HTLV in AIDS has appeared from the
National Cancer Institute and other centers [17] as well as possible evidence of per-
son-to-person [18-19] and perinatal transmission [19]. The details of this relation-
ship to HTLV have just been published in a series of five papers in Science [20-24].
319PATHOGENESIS OF AIDS
They document the presence of antibody to cell membrane antigens of HTLV in sera
from 19 of 75 AIDS patients (25.3 percent) and in 6 of 23 (26 percent) of patients
with the lymphadenopathy syndrome (LAS) as compared with only 1 of 71 matched
and 0/118 unmatched homosexual controls and in none of 139 blood donors [21];
HTLV-DNA or viral isolates have been found in 3/35 AIDS patients, one of which
has been identified as HTLV-1 [23]; a French group has isolated another distinct
type of HTLV from the lymph node of a patient with LAS which cross-reacted
serologically with HTLV-1 antigens [24]. These results suggest a possible pathogenic
role of HTLV-like retroviruses in AIDS but don't exclude the possibility that HTLV-
like agents are secondary invaders. The presence of antibody to HTLV in only 25.3
percent of AIDS patients could be due to lack of sensitivity of the test, to HTLV-like
agents that don't react to the antigen used, or to the existence of other causative
agents. The low isolation rate of only 8.6 percent could be due to lack of sensitivity
to the test system, to loss or destruction of T4 infected cells, or to other causes. Con-
firmation and extension of the data by others will be needed as well as prospective,
incidence studies as discussed later in this paper.
The following discussion is based on the hypothesis that HTLV or related agent is
one of the causes of AIDS. Infection of T4 (helper) cells by such a virus might initi-
ate either a proliferative T-cell response resulting in the adult leukemia/lymphoma
(ATL) syndrome [8] or a lytic response leading to AIDS. The ATL syndrome is seen
primarily in adults of both sexes, in Japanese in southern Japan, and in the Carib-
bean islands and southern U.S. [8,9]. AIDS has been recognized primarily in young
and middle-aged adult males in the U.S., Haiti, and some foreign countries. No out-
break of the AIDS syndrome has been reported from southern Japan where up to 30
percent of healthy adults including both males and females have HTLV anti-
body [8,9] although one case has recently been noted [25]. The factors that lead to a
lytic or proliferative response to HTLV are unknown, as are the different geo-
graphic and ethnic differences. Certainly, behavioral and sexual practices differ, as
could the portal of entry of the agent in the leukemia/lymphoma syndrome and in
AIDS, or a different strain of HTLV is involved that is lytic.
The factors resulting in a direct lytic effect of HTLV-like virus in AIDS could be
due to antigenic bombardment with diverse infectious agents as seen in many active
urban homosexuals, to an unusual portal of entry of HTLV, or to large dosage of
the virus (many and multiple partners). The trauma and bleeding associated with ac-
tive anal intercourse in the passive partner could lead to viral entry into the blood
stream. The occurrence of AIDS in hemophiliacs might be related to repeated ad-
ministrations of Factor VIII or blood transfusions which might contain HTLV; in
Haitians the factors are unclear but are probably behavioral rather than ethnic in
character. The lytic effect could also be a secondary event resulting from an initial
increase in suppressor and cytotoxic T-cell activity, as seen in infectious mono-
nucleosis [1-5,26-27] and due to neo-antigens induced on T cells by HTLV, or to
other agents. Whatever its genesis, the lytic effect on helper T cells impairs a key link
in our cell-mediated immune system. This could lead to (1) impaired surveillance of
malignant cells, (2) reactivation of latent viruses, especially herpes viruses and latent
CNS viruses, (3) reactivation of certain intracellular agents (M. avium intracellulari,
T. gondii) and other opportunistic infections (Pneumocystis carinii, candida, and
the like), and (4) impairment of the primary immune response to these agents. This
latter problem is of major importance in homosexuals who are exposed to multiple
partners, multiple antigens, and multiple portals of entry. The reactivation of EBV
320 ALFRED S. EVANS
PATHOGENESIS OF AIDS 321
and cytomeglovirus (CMV) is of special interest. EBV reactivation in B lymphocytes
could lead to polyclonal B-cell proliferation [14], high EBV antibody titers, and the
whole cascade of EBV events as discussed below. CMV reactivation, or the lack of
control of a primary infection, might be manifested as an acute CMV mononucleo-
sis syndrome, as lymphadenitis, or, in a more chronic phase, as Kaposi's sar-
coma [14]. Like T. gondii, latent viruses in the central nervous systems also might
reactivate such pathogens as papova and measles viruses, leading to progressive mul-
tifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
(SSPE). The potential spectrum of the acute and chronic consequences of AIDS is
not yet fully known and as more persons with T4/T8 disturbances are followed
longer, new manifestations may be recognized. The current status of HTLV in leu-
kemia/lymphoma and in AIDS has been well summarized in a recent editorial [26].
THE B-CELL CASCADE
Re-activation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) present in infected B cells may occur in
patients with AIDS as manifested by an increase in EBV antibody titer, by poly-
clonal expansion of B cells, immunoglobulin production, and by the appearance of
B-cell lymphomas. The cascade of events following primary EBV infection can be of
proliferative or, less commonly, of a lytic nature. These possible outcomes are pre-
sented in Fig. 3 as derived from previous work [2-4].
The proliferative events include the transformation and "immortalization" of B
lymphocytes and a polyclonal B-cell expansion. A wide spectrum of antibodies are
produced by B cells, including antibodies to various EBV antigens, the heterophile
antibody, and a variety of auto-antibodies [2]. The induction of new antigens on the
surface of B cells by EBV evokes a vigorous T-cell response in older children and
young adults that is manifested as infectious mononucleosis. These proliferative
events are usually brought under control through suppressor and cytotoxic T-lym-
phocyte activity as well as non-specific "killer" T lymphocytes early in disease. This
makes infectious mononucleosis usually a benign and self-limited disease [2,27,28].

When B-cell proliferation is left unchecked as a result of a genetic (X-linked) or an
acquired defect in T-cell responsiveness, then acute lymphoblastic sarcoma may
result [29-31]. When EBV infection occurs early in infancy in Africa there may be
impairment of an appropriate cytotoxic and suppressor T-cell response and an aug-
mentation of B-cell proliferation from the polyclonal B-cell mitogenic effect of
holendemic malaria [32]. This leads to a chromosomal change in the rapidly pro-
liferating B cells, usually a translocation of a piece of chromosome 8 to chromosome
14 (14q + translocation) which renders one B cell malignant, and the monoclonal
tumor known as African Burkitt lymphoma (ABL) arises from this event, with a
peak around age seven to nine [33]. There is also strong virologic association of EBV
to nasopharyngeal cancer manifested by high antibody titers and the presence of
EBV genome in tumor cells [34]. The tumor occurs in adults with tenfold higher in-
cidence in Chinese. High EBV antibodies also occur in 30-40 percent of Hodgkin's
disease (HD) [35-36] even prior to diagnoses [37], but the genome has not been
demonstrated in HD tissue [38]. The proliferating B cells also produce increased im-
munoglobulins of various types, EBV and heterophile antibodies, and a plethora of
connective tissue and other autoantibodies [39]. The lytic effect may occur in the
X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome [29] and result in B-cell loss, hypo- or ag-
gammaglobulinemia, or aplastic anemia.
PROOF OF HYPOTHESIS
The role of HTLV and of other candidate agents (CMV, HBV, and so on) in the
causation of AIDS can only be established, in the author's view, by prospective
serological/immunological studies as proposed at a recent National Institutes of
Health Workshop on the Epidemiology of AIDS [40], or by a suitable laboratory
model, if one can be found.
The advantages of prospective (cohort) serological/immunological studies are
(1) the incidence of infection, disease, and death can be measured in a defined group
of persons, (2) susceptibility can often be determined at the start of the study by the
presence or absence of antibody or other markers, (3) the sequence and temporal
relation of serologic and immunologic events can be ascertained, (4) the risk of
developing a disease can be calculated in relation to seroconversion to various
microbial agents as well as to other risk factors, (5) both clues to the etiology and to
pathogenesis can be uncovered, (6) given a known etiologic agent the biologic spec-
trum of response can be measured both quantitatively in terms of severity and
qualitatively in terms of the various clinical syndromes manifested, (7) the ratio of
inapparent to apparent infection (subclinical:clinical) is determinable, and (8) se-
rum, secretions, and other materials can be obtained serially, frozen away, and
tested later. The possible methods of analysis include (1) analysis and testing of the
entire cohort at the start, during, and at the end of a defined period, (2) analysis and
follow-up of the susceptible group alone, or (3) a case/control analysis based on
retrospective analysis and testing of those who developed the disease as compared to
persons shown to be susceptible at the start but who did not develop the disease [46].
In the understanding of the etiology of AIDS the most critical issue is the tem-
poral relationship of infection by various candidate agents to the inversion of the
T4/T8 ratio and of other immunologic markers (beta 2 microglobulin, alpha inter-
feron, thymosin), and to the development of the clinical symptoms of AIDS. It must
be shown that infection with the candidate agent precedes these events, and that the
incidence of infection (manifested by viral isolation and/or antibody seroconver-
sion) is significantly higher in those that develop AIDS than in those who do not.
322 ALFRED S. EVANS
PATHOGENESIS OF AIDS
Similar epidemiological techniques have been very useful in establishing the causal
role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in infectious mononucleosis [40,41] and in African
Burkitt lymphoma [34].
In the study of AIDS, I suggest selection of exposed (homosexual, intravenous
drug users, hemophiliacs) and unexposed persons to the known risk factors of AIDS.
At the start, one should obtain detailed questionnaire data related to various possi-
ble risk factors and appropriate specimens. Next, identify those who are "suscep-
tible" as determined by: (1) no clinical feature of AIDS or its prodrome, (2) normal
immune system (normal T4/T8 ratio and/or normal alpha thymosin or acid labile
interferon), and (3) absence of antibody to HTLV and normal EBV and CMV anti-
body levels (if possible to test). This susceptible group should be serially followed
for evidence of changes in the immune system and seroconversion or for a rise in
titer to candidate agents; of greatest interest are the serologic changes that accom-
pany or precede a detectable change in an immunologic marker, especially T4/T8
alteration. The initial screening for "susceptibility" may be expensive and time-
consuming but attention directed at this group alone, rather than the whole cohort,
may save money and effort in the end. The need for inclusion of a non-exposed
group in the cohort is that serologic and immunologic events unrelated to the eti-
ology of AIDS or antibody increases may occur that play no role in the pathogenesis
of AIDS. The endpoints to be determined are the occurrence of infection, of immu-
nologic changes or other markers, and of the clinical manifestations of AIDS. The
size of the cohort needed to identify the risk factors and etiologic agent(s) ofAIDS is
not clear. My estimate is that of 1,000 active urban homosexuals only about 50 per-
cent or 500 would be "susceptible" (with a normal T4/T8 and alpha thymosin level)
and that 10 percent ofthese (50) might be "infected" per year, of whom perhaps 2-10
percent (one to five persons) would develop clinical manifestations of AIDS. For
comparison, a prospective study of 1,400 West Point cadets for the role of EBV in
infectious mononucleosis showed 437 were susceptible at the start (lacked EBV an-
tibody), 54 were infected during the first year, and there were 15 clinical cases of in-
fectious mononucleosis [42]. Thus, a cohort of considerable size may be required to
yield many cases of AIDS. Concentrating on a high-risk, susceptible population and
a susceptible heterosexual control group would seem to be the most efficient ap-
proach. If AIDS is due to a single transmissible agent then great geographical dif-
ferences might exist in these estimates, depending upon whether or not the agent has
been introduced, the prevalence of infected persons in the community, and the prob-
ability of an infected person and a susceptible coming into appropriate contact. As
of this writing, five prospective studies with approximately 1,000 homosexuals in
each have been funded by NIH in five urban centers. Sera already collected in the
hepatitis B vaccine trial in homosexuals in New York City [43] could also be tested to
determine if the incidence of HTLV (or other) infection was higher in those persons
later developing AIDS than in those remaining normal. Unfortunately, lymphocytes
were not collected and frozen away in that study so that the relationship of infection
to T4/T8 conversion can not be measured. The study of hemophiliacs who sub-
sequently developed AIDS and of the donors to the pool of Factor VIII, as recently
reported [44], provides another opportunity for testing antibody levels in donors
and patients as compared with controls., Investigation of high-risk groups other than
homosexuals has the advantage of freedom from multiple infections but the dis-
advantage of a lower risk. Recommendations of the NIH workshop [45] for epi-
demiological approaches are scheduled for publication in the Journal ofInfectious
Diseases.

DISCUSSION
In the classical sequence of investigating an epidemic there comes a time when a
hypothesis that best fits the assembled facts is made. Then one sets out to prove or
disprove the hypothesis. Several other authors have presented theirs on AIDS
[46-48]. In general, most investigators feel that the concept of a transmissible agent
is the most likely. Among the leading candidate agents and their proponents are
cytomegalovirus [48-49], Epstein-Barr virus [46], hepatitis B virus and/or its associ-
ated Delta agent [50-51], and a human T-cell leukemia or related retrovirus [21-24].
The hypothesis presented in this paper is that an HTLV-like virus, or related retro-
virus, best meets the biological characteristics of the cause of AIDS. In this concept
infection of T4 cells leads to the lysis and/or suppression by T8 cells which initiates
the reactivation of EBV, CMV, and other latent viral, bacterial, and fungal agents.
The major limitation to the current evidence for this, or any other candidate agent,
is that only prevalence data for antibody are available. As emphasized at a recent
NIH workshop on AIDS [40] and in this paper we need careful, prospective, sero-
logic and immunological studies of susceptible persons (with a normal T4/T8 ratio)
who are at high risk in order to ascertain the temporal sequence of infection of
various candidate agents in relation to the appearance of changes in the immune
system, to various markers (acid labile interferon, beta-2-microglobulin, thymosin),
and to the prodromata and early clinical features of AIDS.
There are critics with arguments against the role of HTLV as a cause of AIDS [52]:
there is no direct evidence that HTLV is cytopathogenic, that a normal T4/T8 ratio
was found in a patient with lymphadenopathy from whom an HTLV virus was
isolated, and that the tropism for T cells does not directly explain Kaposi sarcoma,
the undifferentiated non-Hodgkin's type of lymphoma, or the Burkitt type of lym-
phoma reported in AIDS patients (which I think are the result of reactivation of
CMV and EBV, respectively). Other critiques state that the antibody has been de-
tected in only 25 percent of AIDS patients, that it may be a cross-reacting, non-
HTLV-induced membrane component, and that antibody titers are usually very low,
perhaps representing a latent, reactivated virus. These problems may relate to (1) the
sensitivity of the test procedure, (2) the use of a HTLV antigen not closely enough
related to the retrovirus causing AIDS, and (3) that primary infection leads to a poor
humoral response in an immunocompromised homosexual host. It is also true that
only a few isolations (about 3 of 33) of HTLV-like viruses have been made from
AIDS patients. These poor results may relate to low sensitivity of the isolation tech-
niques for the virus or to the low number of infected T4 cells available when sam-
pled. In mny view, the evidence of transmission of AIDS via blood or blood products,
even though rare, gives strong support to the concept that an infectious agent in the
blood can transmit AIDS even to relatively healthy recipients [43]. If the subclinical:
clinical ratio of infection to disease is high, then we must be concerned about the
prevalence of unrecognized infection and the duration of an unrecognized infectious
state in high-risk populations. I feel that the agent responsible is probably newly in-
troduced into the U.S. and that a HTLV-like agent is a strong candidate for causa-
tion.
ADDENDUM
Strong evidence implicating a HTLV-like virus, one termed HTLV-III, has been
presented by Gallo and his group at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in a series
of four papers in the May 4, 1984, issue of Science [53-56]. Similar data for a virus
324 ALFRED S. EVANS
PATHOGENESIS OF AIDS 325
called lymphadenopathy virus (LAV) are emerging from Vilmer et al. at the Pasteur
Institute [57,58]. It is probable that HTLV-III and LAV are closely related, if not
identical. The NCI group has isolated HTLV from 18/25 (72 percent) of pre-AIDS
patients, 22/26 (85 percent) of AIDS patients, 0/115 heterosexuals, and one of
22 healthy homosexuals (the one positive later developed AIDS); the French have
12 isolates. Serologically 43/49 (88 percent) of AIDS patients have antibody to
HTLV-III as well as 11/14 (79 percent) of mild AIDS, 7/17 (41.2 percent) healthy
homosexuals, and only one of 186 (0.5 percent) normal controls. HTLV produces
lysis of T4 helper cells and shows serological cross-reactions with membrane tests for
HTLV-I and HTLV-II.
