Abstract
Background: Mutations in the gene coding for the RNA component of telomerase, hTERC, have been
found in autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita (DC) and aplastic anemia. Paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a clonal blood disorder associated with aplastic anemia and characterized by the
presence of one or more clones of blood cells lacking glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored proteins
due to a somatic mutation in the PIGA gene.
Methods: We searched for mutations in DNA extracted from PNH patients by amplification of the hTERC
gene and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC). After a mutation was found in a
potential transcription factor binding site in one patient electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to
detect binding of transcription factors to that site. The effect of the mutation on the function of the
promoter was tested by transient transfection constructs in which the promoter is used to drive a
reporter gene.
Results: Here we report the finding of a novel promoter mutation (-99C->G) in the hTERC gene in a
patient with PNH. The mutation disrupts an Sp1 binding site and destroys its ability to bind Sp1. Transient
transfection assays show that mutations in this hTERC site including C-99G cause either up- or down-
regulation of promoter activity and suggest that the site regulates core promoter activity in a context
dependent manner in cancer cells.
Conclusions: These data are the first report of an hTERC promoter mutation from a patient sample which
can modulate core promoter activity in vitro, raising the possibility that the mutation may affect the
transcription of the gene in hematopoietic stem cells in vivo, and that dysregulation of telomerase may play
a role in the development of bone marrow failure and the evolution of PNH clones.

Background
Dyskeratosis congenita is an inherited bone marrow fail-
ure syndrome whose characteristic features are nail dystro-
phy, abnormal skin pigmentation and mucosal
leucoplakia [1]. There are X-linked, autosomal dominant
and recessive forms of the disease. The X-linked form is
due to mutations in the gene, DKC1, which codes for the
nucleolar protein dyskerin [2]. Dyskerin is a component
of snoRNP complexes involved in rRNA maturation [3]
and is also associated with the telomerase complex [4].
Autosomal dominant DC is due to mutations in the gene,
hTERC [5] encoding the telomerase RNA component, sug-
gesting the pathology of DC is largely due to defective tel-
omerase. The recent finding of hTERC mutations in cases
presenting with aplastic anaemia [6,7] has introduced the
possibility that defects in telomerase may be more wide-
spread than previously thought.
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is a clonal
blood disorder which often develops in association with
aplastic anaemia [8]. In PNH a somatic mutation in the
PIGA gene disrupts the synthesis of GPI anchors resulting
in the growth of one or more clones of GPI- blood cells
(which lack GPI anchored proteins such as CD55 and
CD59) [9]. It is presumed that these cells survive in the
aplastic marrow because they evade the insult that is kill-
ing the other cells (GPI+) and leading to aplasia [8]. The
nature of the insult is not known but it is presumed to
involve one or more GPI linked proteins. PNH is not
known to be inherited. While there are cases of familial or
constitutional AA the vast majority of cases are idiopathic.
However the observation that idiopathic AA often occurs
after exposure to a drug or other chemical that many peo-
ple are exposed to suggests that there may be a genetic pre-
disposition to the development of AA. Here we present a
case of PNH in which the proband was found to have a
mutation in an Sp1 binding site in the promoter of
hTERC. In vitro analysis of the mutated promoter suggests
the mutation may affect hTERC promoter activity and
thus might influence telomerase levels.
Methods
Case History
An 18 year-old Turkish man presented with a three month
history of fatigue, nose and gum bleeding. He was found
to have pancytopenia at his local Hospital and was
referred to the Haematology Department of the Cerrah-
pasa Medical Faculty (University of Istanbul) in August
2001 for further management. His past medical history
was unremarkable and there was no recent exposure to
chemicals or drugs. Physical examination was unremarka-
ble except for marked pallor and petechiae. Spleen was
not palpable. His initial investigations were as follows:
Hb 4.1 g/dl, WBC 1.4 × 109/l (0.6 × 109/l neutrophils),
platelets 10.0 × 109/l, reticulocytes 0.4%, MCV 115.4 fl.
Blood film showed anisocytosis with prominent poikilo-
cytes and polychromasia. The serum iron, iron binding
capacity, vitamin B12, folic acid and haptoglobin meas-
urements were within the normal range. His LDH and
indirect bilirubin were slightly elevated.
Bone marrow biopsy revealed variable cellularity between
<5% to 60%. Cellular parts of the marrow displayed focal
erythroid hyperplasia with megaloblastoid and dyseryth-
ropoietic features. Myelopoiesis was relatively reduced
and some megakaryocytes were present.
Direct Coombs test was negative. Hemosiderinuria was
detected. Flow cytometric analysis revealed absence of
CD55 and CD59 on all granulocytes consistent with a
diagnosis of PNH. He was initially treated with pred-
nisolone (1 mg/kg/day). A moderate increase in the Hb
level and reticulocyte counts (4.6%) was noted lasting a
few weeks. No improvement was seen in the leucocyte
and platelet counts. In November 2001 his blood count
was as follows: Hb 4.7 g/dl, WBC 2.4 × 109/l, platelets
17.0 × 109/l. He was cushingoid and developed steroid
induced myopathy. The prednisolone was discontinued
and he was supported with erythrocyte and platelet trans-
fusions. His blood counts were January 2002 (Hb: 4.5 g/
dl, WBC 2.5 × 109/l, platelets 60 × 109/l), December 2003
(Hb:5.5 g/dl, WBC 2.9 × 109/l, Hct: 16%, platelets 13 ×
109/l). In July 2002 an archived DNA sample was sent to
the Department of Heamatology, Hammersmith Hospital
to screen for mutations in the hTERC gene. In December
2003 DNA extracted from a buccal smear was screened for
hTERC mutations.
Mutation analysis
A 654 bp fragment encompassing the hTERC gene was
amplified by PCR with the primer pair 5'
TCATGGCCGGAAATGGAACT3' and
5'GGGTGACGGATGCGCACGAT3' using the conditions
described previously [5]. Fragments were screened for
mutation by denaturing high performance liquid chroma-
tography (dHPLC) using the Transgenomic WAVE DNA
fragment analysis system. When an abnormal pattern of
elution was observed, the sample was re-amplified and
subjected to direct sequence analysis by BigDye chain ter-
mination cycle sequencing. The products of the reaction
were run on a 3700 DNA analyser and the sequences read
using the EditView automated DNA sequence viewer
(Applied Biosystems Inc). Restriction enzyme digestion of
PCR products was carried out according to manufacturers
instructions (New England Biolabs).
Construction of reporter plasmids and mutagenesis
Primers carrying restriction sites were used for PCR with
hProm867 as the template to generate a series of 5' and 3'
terminal deletions with compatible ends for cloning as

Xho I/Hind III fragments into the multiple cloning region
of the promoter-less luciferase vector pGL3-basic
(Promega, Madison, WI). A two step cloning strategy was
used for site-directed mutagenesis to prevent unexpected
mutations in luciferase reporter vectors; (i) an hTR 176 bp
fragment (2923 wt, spanning from -107 to +69 bp) was
cloned into the Xho I/Hind III sites in pCR-Script™ plasmid
vector (Stratagene, La, Jolla CA), which was used as tem-
plate for PCR using a QuikChange™ site-directed muta-
genesis kit (Stratagene, La, Jolla CA) following the
manufacturer's instructions. (ii) All mutation fragments
were reconstructed into the Xho I/Hind III sites of pGL3-
basic vectors and verified by DNA sequencing. Primers
carrying the mutations and a second set of primers for
subcloning were designed. The PCR reaction was per-
formed with these primers and 2923 wt or 2925 wt as
template to create single-site mutation constructs. The
double-site mutation construct, mSp1(2), harbouring a
C-101A/C-100A double substitution, or No-Sp1, har-
bouring both the C-101A/C-100A double substitution
and an ATGT substitution in site Sp1.1 were generated in
several separate PCR reactions using mSp1.2 constructs as
template. Minimal promoter mutation constructs based
on 2925 wt contained the PNH C-99G mutation in site
Sp1.2. The following oligonucleotides were used as PCR
primers:
hTR23(+69 to +46) Hind III, 5'-cgcaagcttTACGCCCTTCT-

Transfection and dual-luciferase reporter assay
3.0 µg of hTERC promoter plasmids containing firefly
luciferase reporters were cotransfected into 5637 bladder
cancer cells with an internal Renilla luciferase control,
pRL-SV40 (Promega) using Superfect Transfection Rea-
gent (Qiagen) as previously described [10,11]. The total
amount of DNA was kept constant at 10 µg with Salmon
sperm DNA. The activity of both firefly and Renilla luci-
ferase was determined 48 h later using the Dual Luciferase
Assay kit (Promega). A minimum of three independent
transfections were performed in duplicate and specific
hTERC promoter activity was normalized to protein as
described elsewhere [10-12].
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs)
Nuclear extracts from cultured 5637 cells were made
according to our previous study [10]. EMSAs were per-
formed using the EMSA kit (Promega, E3300). 5.0 µg of
nuclear extract proteins were incubated in 15 µl of reac-
tion containing 4% glycerol, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithi-
othreitol (DTT), 0.5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-
HCl, pH7.5 and 2.0 µg poly(dI-dC) with or without 100-
fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA competitors on ice
for 15 min, followed by addition of the radiolabelled
probe. All DNA-protein complexes were resolved by elec-
trophoresis on 5% native polyacrylamide.
Results
In a screen of aplastic anemia samples for hTERC muta-
tions we found a changed dHPLC elution pattern in a
Turkish PNH patient. We subsequently analysed 12 other
PNH patients in our collection and all appeared normal
on dHPLC. DNA sequence analysis showed that the
abnormal sample was heterozygous for a C->G substitu-
tion, 99 bp upstream of the hTERC transcript (Figure 1).
Since this mutation results in the loss of an AvaI site
present in the normal hTERC gene, we were able to con-
firm the presence of both mutant and normal alleles in
this sample by restriction enzyme digestion of the appro-
priate PCR product (data not shown). This mutation was
detected by dHPLC analysis in DNA extracted from a buc-
cal smear taken from the patient, indicating the mutation
is constitutional. It was not detected by denaturing HPLC
analysis in 100 ethnically matched DNA samples. The C-
99 residue is located in a core binding sequence for the
Sp1 transcription factor (site Sp1.2 [11]). The mutation
changes this sequence from 5'CCGCCC3' to
5'CCGCCG3'. We postulated that the mutation might dis-
rupt the Sp1 binding to the hTERC promoter. Initial anal-
ysis of transcription factor binding sites in the mutant
sequence using the TRANSFAC search tool revealed that
the predicted Sp1.2 binding site was lost in the patient
mutant sequence.
In order to determine whether the patient C-99G muta-
tion functionally affects Sp1 binding to the Sp1.2 site, we
first examined the ability of the mutant sequence to bind
Sp1/Sp3 in electromobility shift assays (EMSA). We previ-
ously demonstrated by supershift analysis that Sp1/Sp3
bind double stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to
the Sp1.2 site with low affinity in vitro but do not bind an
oligo in which C-101/C-100 are replaced with AA [13]
(Figure 2, h41 m). We now constructed oligos in which C-
99 was replaced with A (h43 m) or with the G substitution

found in the patient (h42 m). Excess of either cold A-99
or patient G-99 mutant failed to compete with the wild
type Sp1.2 oligo for Sp1/Sp3 binding, indicating that an
hTERC promoter mutation identified in the PNH patient
disrupts the ability of Sp1/Sp3 to bind a regulatory site in
the core promoter. To confirm disruption of Sp1/Sp3
binding, labelled h42 m and h43 m oligos were incubated
with 5637 cell nuclear extract, but did not form retarded
complexes although complex formation was seen with the
wild type Sp1.2 oligo (data not shown).
To investigate whether the loss of Sp1/Sp3 binding might
have functional effects on the activity of the hTERC core
promoter we constructed wild type and mutant hTERC-
luciferase reporter plasmids and analysed relative luci-
ferase activity by transient transfection in 5637 bladder
cancer cells. We previously showed that the activity of the
core hTERC promoter is regulated by Sp1 sites
surrounding the CCAAT box (Sp1.1 and Sp1.2) and by
Sp1 sites downstream of the transcriptional start site
which have a general repressive role (Sp1.3 and Sp1.4).
Removal of the downstream sequence encompassing
nucleotides +11 to +69 leads to an approximately 2.5-fold
induction in core promoter activity [11,13]. We now
examined the effects of the patient C-99G mutation on

hTERC promoter activity in the absence of downstream
negative regulation using this minimal construct compris-
ing Sp1.2, CCAAT and Sp1.1 (nucleotides -107 to +10).
Consistent with our previous analysis, mutation of the
Sp1.1 site led to strong induction of core promoter activ-
ity, confirming a repressive role for this site (figure 3C). In
the minimal promoter context a single mutant construct
harbouring the Sp1.2 C-99G mutation had an increased
reporter activity, suggesting that this site acts as a repressor
of transcription. Additionally, the combined ablation of
both Sp1.2 by the PNH C-99G substitution and Sp1.1 led
to a weak further increase in promoter activity relative to
the Sp1.1 single mutant. Interestingly, we previously
observed that inactivation of Sp1/Sp3 binding to Sp1.2 in
the context of the larger core promoter (-107 to +69) by a
C-101A/C-100A double substitution (mSp1.2, figure 3B)
results in a slight decrease of hTERC promoter activity,
identifying Sp1.2 as a positive regulator of hTERC tran-
scription (compare figures 3B, re-analysed and re-plotted
previous observations, and 3C).
Thus, the role of Sp1.2 would appear to be dependent on
the promoter context. Since both mutations have been
shown to disrupt Sp1/Sp3 binding, the present results
extend our view of the role of Sp1.2 in the core hTERC
promoter, suggesting that Sp1.2 may act as both a positive
and a negative regulatory site. This would be consistent
with the ability of Sp1 sites to bind both positive or nega-
tive regulators and may also be consistent with a scenario
in which co-operativity with downstream binding factors
might recruit specific factors in a context dependent man-
ner. In totality, the data confirm the role of Sp1.2 as a
functional regulator of the hTERC promoter and provide
the first evidence that a bona fide hTERC promoter muta-
tion found in a human pathology may modulate core
hTERC promoter activity in vitro.
Discussion
The hTERC mutation described in this study affects the
core consensus sequence for one of 4 Sp1 binding sites in
the core hTERC promoter [13]. EMSA analysis indicated
that the pathogenic mutation destroyed the binding of the
transcriptional regulators Sp1 and Sp3 to this site (termed
Sp1.2). Transient transfection of hTERC promoter-luci-
ferase constructs confirmed that this site is a functional
regulator of hTERC core promoter activity and that intro-
duction of the patient mutation at this site modulates core
hTERC promoter activity. Our data show that Sp1.2 has
the capacity to mediate both positive and negative regula-
tion of hTERC, in a context dependent manner depending
on the other sites available for transcription factor bind-
ing in the core promoter. This raises the possibility that
Sp1.2 might exhibit functional co-operativity in vivo and
that its role might vary, possibly even in a cell-specific
manner, depending on the full complement of factors
bound to the core promoter.
It is tempting to speculate that mutation of Sp1.2 might
contribute to the pathogenesis of PNH, especially given
recent reports implicating perturbation of hTERC steady
state levels in dyskeratosis congenita and in idiopathic
aplastic anaemia [5-7]. The picture that is emerging is one
in which the role of hTERC levels in the regulation of tel-
omerase in non-malignant tissues may be more important
than was previously thought. In support of this argument
are the findings that haploinsufficiency of the telomerase
RNA component is sufficient to result in shortened telom-
eres both in autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita
in humans and in mTerc+/- heterozygous mice [5,14]. In X-
linked DC the mutations in DKC1 are thought to act by
reducing the stability of hTERC leading to decreased tel-
omerase levels [4], though they may also act through a
defect in rRNA production [15]. Nevertheless it is interest-
ing that amongst the DKC1 mutations is a point mutation
in a conserved Sp1 binding site in the promoter [16]that
in vitro has been shown to reduce transcription of the gene
[17].
Conclusions
This is the first report of a hTERC mutation in a patient
with PNH. This has important implications for the con-
ventional model of PNH development. It is generally
accepted that two factors are required for the development
of PNH. One is bone marrow failure, in fact PNH clones
are found in ~30% of AA patients and ~20% of myelodys-
plasia (MDS) patients. The second factor is a pathogenic
PIGA mutation. The PNH clone is thought to expand
because the GPI- cells have a growth or survival advantage
over the GPI+ clones in the context of an aplastic bone
marrow. The nature of the survival advantage is unknown
but is thought to be mediated via one or more GPI linked
proteins by an immunological mechanism. The implica-
tions of the present findings are that aplastic anaemia
caused by a genetic mechanism can also lead to PNH, sug-
gesting the growth advantage of GPI- cells may be more
subtle than resistance to cell killing via GPI linked pro-
teins. It has been known for some time that cells from
patients with aplastic anemia have significantly shorter
telomeres than cells from matched controls [18-20]. This
could be due to a direct effect on telomere synthesis or an
indirect effect through for example increased cell death
leading to increased proliferation of a smaller number of
progenitor cells. Studies on PNH patients' telomere
lengths have been inconsistent [18,19] but a recent study
of 10 patients with primary classical PNH showed granu-
locytes with significantly shorter telomeres than controls
[21]. Moreover both GPI- and GPI+ cells showed telomere
shortening suggesting it reflects the underlying aplastic
anemia rather than the proliferation of the PNH clone. It
BMC Blood Disorders 2004, 4 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2326/4/3

remains to be seen if hTERC mutations or other genetic
disturbances of the telomere maintenance pathway are
the exception or the rule in AA and PNH.
