Introduction
Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
(BMMSCs) have been identified as a population of
postnatal stem cells with the potential to self-renew and
differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes,
and neural cells [1-5]. BMMSCs also exhibit immuno­
modulatory and regulatory effects on T and B lympho­
cytes, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells, indicating
an attractive feature for cell therapy [6-11]. In addition,
culture expanded BMMSCs may fail to express MHC-
class II antigens on their surfaces, therefore allogenic
BMMSCs have been used in treating a variety of diseases
such as acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) [12-14],
ame­lio­rat­ing Hematopoietic Stem Cell engraftment [15,
16], and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [17].
Recently, mesenchymal stem cells derived from other
tissues have also been found to possess immuno­
modulatory functions [18-20] which offer opportunities
to find more effective and feasible mesenchymal stem cell
sources for cell therapies.
Stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth
(SHED) have been isolated from naturally exfoliated
deciduous teeth with the capacity to differentiate into
osteogenic and odontogenic cells, adipocytes, and neural
cells [21]. As neural crest cell-associated postnatal stem
cells, SHED express a variety of neural cell markers
including nestin, beta III tubulin, GAD, NeuN, GFAP,
NFM, and CNPase [21]. Also, SHED are able to form
bone when transplanted in vivo [22] and offer obvious
bone regeneration for repairing calvarial defects in a
mouse model [23]. It is unknown whether SHED possess
Abstract
Introduction: Stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) have been identified as a population of
postnatal stem cells capable of differentiating into osteogenic and odontogenic cells, adipogenic cells, and neural
cells. Herein we have characterized mesenchymal stem cell properties of SHED in comparison to human bone
marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs).
Methods: We used in vitro stem cell analysis approaches, including flow cytometry, inductive differentiation,
telomerase activity, and Western blot analysis to assess multipotent differentiation of SHED and in vivo implantation
to assess tissue regeneration of SHED. In addition, we utilized systemic SHED transplantation to treat systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE)-like MRL/lpr mice.
Results: We found that SHED are capable of differentiating into osteogenic and adipogenic cells, expressing
mesenchymal surface molecules (STRO-1, CD146, SSEA4, CD73, CD105, and CD166), and activating multiple signaling
pathways, including TGFβ, ERK, Akt, Wnt, and PDGF. Recently, BMMSCs were shown to possess an immunomodulatory
function that leads to successful therapies for immune diseases. We examined the immunomodulatory properties
of SHED in comparison to BMMSCs and found that SHED had significant effects on inhibiting T helper 17 (Th17) cells
in vitro. Moreover, we found that SHED transplantation is capable of effectively reversing SLE-associated disorders in
MRL/lpr mice. At the cellular level, SHED transplantation elevated the ratio of regulatory T cells (Tregs) via Th17 cells.
Conclusions: These data suggest that SHED are an accessible and feasible mesenchymal stem cell source for treating
immune disorders like SLE.

this study, we compare immuno-regulatory properties
between SHED and BMMSCs and utilize SHED trans­
plantation to treat SLE-like diseases in a murine model.
Materials and methods
Mice
C57BL/6J and C3MRL-Faslpr
/J (MRL/lpr) mice (female,
six- to seven-week-old) were purchased from the Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Beige nude/nude Xid
(III) mice (female, 8- to 12-week-old) were purchased

Results
SHED possess mesenchymal stem cell properties
Although SHED are capable of differentiating into a
variety of cell types [21], their detailed mesenchymal
stem cell properties remain to be elucidated. Herein, we
used flow cytometry, immunoblot analysis, and immuno­
cytostaining analysis to demonstrate that SHED at passage
3 expressed many mesenchymal surface markers,
including STRO-1, SSEA4, CD73, CD105, CD146, and
CD166 but were negative for CD34 and CD45 (Figures 1A-
1C). In comparison to BMMSCs, SHED expressed
significantly higher levels of STRO-1 and CD146, and
lower levels of CD105 (Figure 1A). Additionally, SHED
showed significantly high numbers of single colony
clusters (colony-forming units-fibroblastic; CFU-F) and an
elevated cell proliferation rate compared to BMMSCs
(Figures 1D and 1E). This elevated proliferative capacity
may be associated with the significantly increased telo­
merase activity in SHED (Figure 1F).
To compare osteogenic differentiation of SHED with
BMMSCs, multiple colony-derived SHED at passage 3
were supplemented with L-ascorbate-2-phosphate, dexa­
metha­sone, and inorganic phosphate to induce
mineraliza­tion in vitro as described previously [21]. After
one week of induction, SHED were similar to BMMSCs,
showing significantly increased alkaline phosphatase
(ALP) activity (Figure 2A) and the number of ALP-
positive cells by flow cytometric analysis (Figure 2B), and
expression of elevated levels of ALP, Runt related
transcription factor 2 (Runx2), dentin sialoprotein (DSP),
and osteocalcin (OCN) by immunoblot analysis
(Figure  2C). Alizarin Red-positive nodule formation in
SHED and BMSMC cultures was notified after four
weeks of osteogenic induction, indicating calcium accu­
mu­lation in vitro (Figures 2D and 2E). However, SHED
suffered remarkable impairment of adipogenic differen­
tiation, as shown by decreased numbers of lipid-specific
Oil red O-positive cells and reduced expression of
adipocyte-specific molecules, peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor g2 (PPARg2) and lipoprotein lipase
(LPL) when compared to BMMSCs (Figures 2F-2H). To
validate the capacity of forming mineralized tissue in
vivo by SHED, ex vivo expanded-SHED were
transplanted into immunocompromised mice with
hydroxyapatite/tri­calcium phosphate (HA/TCP) as a
carrier. SHED formed a similar amount of mineralized
tissue and a reduced amount of hematopoietic marrow
components when compared to BMMSC transplants
(Figures 2I-2K). Next, we confirmed that SHED were
similar to BMMSCs in activation of multiple signaling
pathways, including TGFβ, ERK, Akt, Wnt, and PDGF
(Figures 2L-2P).
Interplays between SHED and T-lymphocytes
In order to compare the immunomodulatory capacity of
SHED with BMMSCs, anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies with
TGFβ/IL-6 were added to the co-cultures of SHED or
BMMSCs with naïve T cells, which were purified from
human PBMNCs, levels of IL17+
IFNg-
Th17 cells and
IL17 were significantly reduced in SHED and BMMSC
groups compared to the naïve T cell group (Figure 3A). It
appeared that SHED showed a significant inhibiting
effect in reducing IL17 levels when compared to
BMMSCs (Figure 3B). Our previous report indicated that
activated T cells induce apoptosis of BMMSCs through
the Fas/FasL pathway [28]. To determine whether activated
T cells also directly impinge on SHED, as occurs in
BMMSCs, SHED were co-cultured with human PBMNCs
activated by anti-CD3 specific antibody treatment. We
found that the activated PBMNCs were able to induce
part of SHED death in the co-culture system (Figure 3C).
When SHED were separated from PBMNCs using a
Transwell co-culture system or treated using anti-FasL
neutralizing antibody, SHED failed to show the cell death
(Figure 3C), suggesting that direct cell-cell contact and
the Fas/FasL pathway are required for inducing SHED
death by activated splenocytes. Next, we confirmed that
SHED express Fas by immunoblot analysis (Figure 3D).

dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was
used to confirm that the SHED death was due to cell
apoptosis (Figure 3E).
SHED transplantation improves SLE phenotypes in
MRL/lpr mice
Our previous study showed that systemic infusion of
BMMSCs offers appropriate treatment for SLE disorders
in human patients and SLE-like MRL/lpr mice [17]. Here
we selected SLE-like mice at 16 weeks of age to infuse
SHED for treating SLE disorders using BMMSCs as a
control (Figure 4A). It is known that autoantibodies play
a crucial role in SLE patients. Our previous study showed
a remarkable increase in the levels of autoantibodies
including anti-double strand DNA (dsDNA) IgG and IgM
antibodies, and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) in the peri­
pheral blood [17]. As seen in BMMSC trans­plan­tation,
SHED transplantation resulted in a significant reduction
in serum levels of anti-dsDNA IgG and IgM, and ANA
antibodies (Figures 4B-4D).
Histological analysis with hematoxylin and eosin,
trichrome, and periodic acid-Schiff staining revealed that
Figure 1. Characterization of SHED in comparison to BMMSCs. (A) Flow cytometric analysis of cultured SHED at passage 3 revealed expression
of STRO-1 (12.06%), CD146 (48.39%), SSEA4 (85.40%), CD73 (91.93%), CD105 (6.77%), CD166 (63.65%), but was negative for surface molecules CD34
and CD45. SHED express high levels of STRO-1 and CD146 (n = 5; P <0.05) and low level of CD105 (n = 5; P <0.01) compared to expression levels of
STRO-1 (8.36%), CD146 (31.19%), and CD105 (13.27%) in BMMSCs. These signals are shown as the red area. Solid lines indicate signals for isotype
matched control antibodies. M1 window show the positive expression defined as the level of fluorescence greater than 99% of the corresponding
isoytpe-matched control antibodies. Representative histograms are shown among five donors. (B) Immunoblot analysis confirmed expression of
CD73, CD105 and CD166 in SHED and BMMSCs. Representative images of n = 5 donors are presented as results. (C) Immunofluoresence confirmed
that SHED express STRO-1, CD146, and SSEA4 along with negative for CD34 and CD45. Red fluorescence indicates the expression of cell surface
markers. Blue cell nuclei were stained by DAPI. Images were representative data of independent experiment (n = 5) with consistent results
(Bar = 50µm). (D) SHED were able to form significantly high numbers of single colonies than BMMSCs when 1x 106
cells were plated at a low density
(*P <0.05) and cultured for 10 days. (E) The proliferation rates of SHED and BMMSCs were assessed by co-culture with BrdU for 18 hours. The number
of BrdU-positive cells was presented as a percentage of the total number of cells counted from five replicate cultures. SHED showed a significantly
higher proliferation rate in comparison to BMMSCs (**P <0.01). (F) SHED showed a high activity of telomerase compared to BMMSCs assessed by
real time PCR. HEK293T cells (239T) were used as a positive control and heat inactivated 293T (H.I.) cells were used as a negative control. The activity
was indicated by a PCR cycle threshold and averaged from three replicated cultures (***P <0.001).

SHED transplantation was similar to BMMSC
transplantation in recovery of SLE-associated renal
disorders, such as nephritis with glomerular basal
membrane disorder and messangial proliferation in
MRL/lpr mice (Figure 4E). ELISA data showed that SHED
and BMMSC transplantation was able to reduce the urine
C3 level and elevate the serum C3 level (Figure 4F). Also,
SHED transplantation significantly reduced urine protein
levels compared to BMMSC transplantation (Figure 4G).
Moreover, SHED and BMMSC transplantation signifi­
cantly elevated creatinine levels in urine and reduced
creatinine levels in serum (Figure 4H). This experimental
evidence indicated that SHED transplantation is an
effective approach for treating SLE disorders.
Figure 2. Mesenchymal stem cell properties of SHED. (A-E) SHED showed a similar osteogenic differentiation potential to BMMSCs. After one
week culture induction under osteogenic conditions, ALP activity and numbers of ALP positive cells in SHED and BMMSCs were significantly higher
than that of the control SHED and BMMSCs, respectively, by ALP staining (Representative of n = 5) (A) and flow cytometric analysis (Representative
of n = 3) (B). Meanwhile, immunoblot analysis showed that the osteogenic induction elevates expression levels of ALP, Runx2, DSP, and OCN in
SHED and BMMSCs (C) (***P <0.001, n = 5). β-actin was used as an internal control. After four weeks culture induction in osteogenic medium, SHED
showed increased capacity of forming mineralized nodules as assessed by alizarin red staining (Representative of n = 5). (D). Alizarin red-positive
area corresponding to total area was averaged from five independent groups (E). (F-H) SHED showed reduced potential of differentiating into
adipocytes compared to BMMSCs. Three weeks post adipogenic induction, lipid accumulation in SHED was less than that in BMMSCs by Oil-red O
staining (Representative of n = 5). (F). Number of oil-red O-positive (Oil-Red-O+) cells was calculated as a percentage to total cells and averaged
from five independent cultures (G) (*P <0.05). Immunoblot assay indicated that SHED expressed lower levels of adipocyte-specific molecules LPL
and PPARγ than BMMSCs at three weeks post adipogenic culture (H). Three independent assays showed the similar results. (I-K) SHED were capable
of forming mineralized tissue when transplanted subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice using HA/TCP as a carrier (Representative of n
= 3). (I). It appeared that SHED form similar amounts of mineralized tissue as seen in a BMMSC transplant (Representative of n = 3) (I, J), but they
generated significantly less bone marrow elements than BMMSCs (K). Newly formed mineralized tissue and bone marrow areas were calculated as
a percentage of the total area and averaged from three independent transplant assays (***P <0.001). B = bone, BM = bone marrow, C =: connective
tissue, H =: hydroxyapatite and tricalcium carrier. (L-P) SHED and BMMSCs express multiple signaling pathways during culture expansion at passage
3. SHED and BMMSCs expressed TGFβ receptor I and II, Smad 2 and phosphorylated Smad 2 (L); P38, phosphorylated P38, ERK, and phosphorylated
ERK (M); Akt and phosphorylated Akt (N); N-cadherin and β-catenin (O); PDGF receptor and Ang-1 (P). Representative image of n = 5.

SHED transplantation regulates ratio ofTregs andTh17 cells
Tregs prevent pathogenic autoimmunity by suppressing
proliferation and production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines in effector immune cells, such as helper T-
lymphocytes [30]. In contrast, Th17 cells that produce
IL17 are inflammatory cells responsible for the patho­
genesis of autoimmune diseases [31] and bone destruc­
tion [32]. Our previous study suggested that BMMSC
transplantation affects the immune balance between
Tregs and Th17 cells in SLE-like disorders [17]. Here we
found that SHED transplantation showed more signifi­
cant effect in up-regulating the ratio of Treg and Th17
cells in comparison to BMMSC transplantation in MRL/
lpr mice (Figures 5A-5C). Both SHED and BMMSC trans­
plantations showed no significant changes in the level of
IL10 and IL6 in MRL/lpr mice (Figures 5D and 5E);
however, SHED transplantation provided a remarkable
reduction of TH17 cells and IL17 level in MRL/lpr mice
when compared to BMMSC transplantation (Figures 5C
and 5F).
Our previous study suggested that BMMSC trans­
plantation-mediated therapy in SLE-like mice may
associate with the reconstructing trabecular bone [17].
Here we found SHED were also capable of reconstructing
trabecular bone in MRL/lpr mice (Figure 6A). In contrast
to BMMSC/osteoblast lineage, osteoclasts play a
significant role in the maintenance of bone homeostasis
by the bone resorption function. We compared SHED
transplantation with BMMSC transplantation in inhibit­
ing osteoclast activity in MRL/lpr mice and found that
both SHED and BMMSC transplantation were able to
reduce the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase
(TRAP)-positive osteoclasts in the distal femur epiphysis
of MRL/lpr mice (Figure 6B), serum levels of runt-related
NF-kB ligand (RANKL), a critical factor for
osteoclastogenesis (Figure 6C), and bone resorption
marker C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (CTX;)
as compared to untreated MRL/lpr mice (Figure 6D).
Discussion
BMMSCs have been successfully utilized to treat a variety
of human diseases, such as bone fracture [33], severe
aplastic anemia [34], acute GVHD [13], and SLE [17].
SLE is a common and potentially fatal immune disease in
Figure 3. SHED interplay with T-lymphocytes. (A, B) Under the anti-CD3 and CD28 antibody along with TGFβ1 and IL-2 stimulation, SHED
showed a significant effect in reducing Th17 cell levels as seen in BMMSCs (A), however, SHED exhibited a significant capacity of inhibiting
IL17 levels than BMMSCs (B) (n = 3, *P <0.05,***P <0.001). (C) PBMNCs activated by anti-CD3 antibody (@CD3Ab, 1 µg/ml) were capable of
inducing significant SHED and BMMSC death as shown by toulidin blue staining. When cells were cultured in an indirect co-culture system using
Transwell,activated slpenocytes they failed to induce SHED and BMMSC death. Neutralization with anti-FasL antibody (@FasLAb, 1 µg/ml) blocked
PBMNC-induced SHED and BMMSC death. Representative of n = 3. (D) SHED express a higher level of Fas in comparison to that in BMMSCs by
immunoblotting. Three independent experiments showed similar results. Representative of n = 3. (E) SHED death caused by active PBMNCs is
through an apoptotic pathway according to the TUNEL staining. The SHED death rate was similar to BMMSCs. The percentage of TUNEL-positive
(TUNEL+) nuclei was indicated to the total number of MSCs and averaged from five replicated cultures (***P <0.005).

which autoantibodies damage multiple organs, including
the kidneys, cardiovascular system, nervous system,
joints, and skin [35]. The pathology of SLE involves the
destruction of targeted organ tissues and accumulation of
auto-reactive lymphocytes and immune complexes.
Although intensity and organ involvement vary
significantly among SLE patients, abnormalities of T and
B lymphocytes are universal [35-37]. Moreover, SLE
provokes multifaceted immune modulation, including
both deficiency and hyperactivity of the immune system.
An understanding of the underlying pathology is crucial
to developing optimal therapies for the restoration of
immune homeostasis without compromising the protec­
tive immune responses to pathogens [38]. MRL/lpr mice
were generated by the insertion of the early transposable
element ETn in the Fas gene, which causes a striking
reduction in Fas mRNA expression and is associated
clinically with marked acceleration of the lupus-like
disease [39]. Levels of circulating immune complexes rise
enormously from about three months of age in MRL-lpr/
lpr but not in MRL mice. In this study, we used MRL/lpr
mice as a SLE mouse model to indicate that SHED are an
appropriate population of postnatal stem cells for SLE
treatment as seen in BMMSC-mediated therapy.
SHED are derived from a very accessible tissue resource
and capable of providing enough cells for potential
clinical application via high proliferation rate and
expression of telomerase [21]. The reason that SHED
transplantation showed optimal therapeutic effect may
be associated with the fact that SHED showed superior
immunomodulatory effects compared to BMMSCs in
terms of recovering Tregs/Th17 ratio and reducing Th17
Figure 4. SHED transplantation reduced levels of autoantibodies and improved renal function in MRL/lpr mice. Figure 4A shows the
scheme of SHED and BMMSC transplantation procedures. (B-D) ELISA quantified that levels of anti dsDNA IgG (B), IgM (C) and nuclear (D)
antibodies (ANA) (mean ± SD) were significantly reduced in the peripheral blood of SHED and BMMSC treated MRL/lpr mice (n = 6) when
compared to un-treated MRL/lpr mice c (n = 6) (***P <0.001). It appeared that SHED transplantation resulted in a more significant reduction in anti
IgG when compared to BMMSC transplantation (B). (E) MRL/lpr mice showed renal disorders such as nephritis with glomerular basal membrane
disorder and mesangium cell over-growth. SHED and BMSSC transplantation resulted in a reduced basal membrane disorder and mesangium
cell over-growth in glomerular (G) (upper panels, H&E staining; middle panels, trichrome staining; lower panels, periodic acid-schiff staining).
Representative images of un-treated, SHED and BMMSC MRL/lpr (n = 6). (F) ELISA analysis showed that SHED transplantation has the same effect
as seen in BMMSC transplantation in significantly reducing C3 level in urine and elevating C3 level in serum (n = 6, *P <0.05, **P <0.01). (G) SHED
transplantation significantly reduced urine protein levels (mean ± SD) compared to BMMSC transplanted MRL/lpr mice (n = 6). (***P <0.001).
(H) Markedly increased urine creatinine and reduced serum creatinine were observed in SHED and BMMSC transplanted MRL/lpr mice (n = 6)
compared to un-treated MRL/lpr mice (n = 6, ***P <0.001, **P <0.01).

cell levels in peripheral blood. In addition, SHED
transplantation, as seen in BMMSC transplantation, is
capable of recovering trabecular bone and inhibiting
osteoclast activity, suggesting that SHED transplantation,
as seen in BMMSC transplantation, could lead the
reconstruction of osteoblastic niche to improve SLE
disorders in SLE patients and a SLE-like murine model
[17]. Therefore, SHED may be an appropriate stem cell
resource for treating immune disorders via improved
immuno­modulatory properties. Systemic infusion of
SHED fails to show a significant promoting Treg level in
SLE-like mice as seen in an in vitro co-culture system,
which may be associated with a complex in vivo condition
that hardly compares to a simple co-culture system.
However, SHED infusion resulted in a significantly up-
regulated level of the ratio between Tregs and Th17 cells.
This is an important index indicating immunomodulatory
function of SHED due to the fact that Tregs prevent
autoimmunity and Th17 cells promote autoimmunity and
inflammation [40].
The transition from deciduous teeth to adult perma­
nent teeth is a unique and dynamic process in which the
development and eruption of permanent teeth is
coordinated with the resorption of deciduous teeth. We
found that exfoliated deciduous tooth crowns contain a
remnant of living pulp comprised of a normal dental pulp
structure, including connective tissue, blood vessels, and
odontoblasts [21]. We demonstrated that these remnants
of pulp tissues in exfoliated deciduous teeth contain
SHED [21]. These studies provide the first evi­dence that a
naturally occurring exfoliated organ contains stem cells
with the ability to form multiple phenotypes, and that
these stem cells may offer a unique stem cell resource for
potential clinical applications. SHED are very easily
acquired from exfoliated teeth and can be expanded ex
vivo to achieve sufficient numbers of cells for tissue
regeneration such as repairing parietal defects [24].
Conclusions
SHED possess similar stem cell properties as those seen
in BMMSCs, including osteo/odontogenic and adipo­
genic differentiation in vitro, forming mineralized tissue
in vivo, and expression of extensive mesenchymal stem
cell markers. Moreover, systemic SHED trans­plantation
is capable of offering similar, if not better, therapeutic
effect on SLE murine model, suggesting that easily
accessed SHED may be a feasible stem cell source for
stem cell therapies.
