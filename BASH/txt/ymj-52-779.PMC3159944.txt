Purpose: In this study, we analyzed a cohort of children with chronic graft-versus-
host disease (GvHD) according to the NIH consensus classification (NCC) in order
to observe whether global assessment at diagnosis correlates with GvHD-specific
endpoints. We then studied the clinical course of these patients, specifically with re-
gards to episodes of GvHD exacerbation requiring treatment escalation. Materials
and Methods: Recipients of either allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT)
or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from January 2006 to August
2008 at the Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea were evalu-
ated for chronic GvHD, which was diagnosed according to the NCC. The course of
chronic GvHD in these patients was then followed. Results: Of 59 evaluable pa-
tients, 23 developed chronic GvHD for a cumulative incidence of 39.3%. Upon mul-
tivariate analysis, previous acute GvHD (≥grade II) had a significant impact on
chronic GvHD incidence. With a median duration of systemic treatment for chronic
GvHD of 501 days, no significant relationship was found between initial global se-
verity of chronic GvHD and either duration of immunosuppressive treatment or final
clinical response to treatment. Fifteen patients (65%) experienced at least one epi-
sode of chronic GvHD exacerbation during the period of follow-up, with a median
of four exacerbations in the subgroup of patients who experienced such events. Lung
GvHD resulted in the highest number of exacerbations per diagnosed patient, fol-
lowed by oral GvHD. Conclusion:Analysis of this small cohort indicates that global
assessment as proposed by the NCC may have limited correlations with GvHD-spe-
cific endpoints, possibly due to the favorable response of children to treatment.

INTRODUCTION
The multitude of manifestations of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) has
made its accurate diagnosis and classification a difficult task. The initial classifica-
tion of chronic GvHD into limited and extensive forms1
was subsequently revised
into a scheme that further elaborated on the types of organ involvement that char-
acterize these subtypes.2
In 2005, the NIH reported a consensus criteria (NCC) for

cohort of pediatric recipients of either allogeneic bone mar-
row (BMT) or G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cell
transplantation (PBSCT) to observe the prognostic potential
of the NCC, especially with regards to the global severity rat-
ing. Specifically, we assessed whether global severity at diag-
nosis correlates with GvHD-specific endpoints such as dura-
tion of systemic immunosuppressive treatment (IST), and
overall clinical response to IST at the last follow-up. Correla-
tion between global severity at diagnosis and GvHD-specific
endpoints was shown in one adult-based study.5
In contrast to
these findings, our hypothesis was that initial severity as mea-
sured by the NCC has limited prognostic value with regards
to these GvHD-specific endpoints in children. Second, we at-
tempted to characterize in detail the clinical course of chronic
GvHD diagnosed in our cohort of pediatric patients, especial-
ly GvHD aggravation during the period of systemic IST.
MATERIALSAND METHODS
　　　
Chronic GvHD cohort
Consecutive pediatric recipients of either allogeneic BMT
or PBSCT from January 2006 to August 2008 at the De-
partment of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea,
Seoul, Korea were evaluated for chronic GvHD. Only pa-
tients who survived the initial 100 days after transplantation
were included in this evaluation. In order to create a unified
cohort for the study of chronic GvHD, recipients of addi-
tional stem cells, in the form of donor lymphocyte infusion
or booster infusion, were excluded, as were recipients of G-
CSF mobilized bone marrow. The study design received
approval from the institutional review board of Seoul Saint
Mary’s Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea.
Overall, among the 59 patients included in the initial
evaluation, chronic GvHD as specified by the NCC was di-
agnosed in 23 patients at a mean duration of 6.7 months
(range: 1.8-23.8 months) after HSCT for a four-year cumu-
lative incidence of 39.3%. The median duration of follow-
up from diagnosis of chronic GvHD was 26.1 months
(range: 8.1-45.6 months). The pertinent clinical characteris-
tics of this chronic GvHD cohort are shown in Table 1.
Transplantation procedure and acute GvHD
Donor and recipient pairs were fully matched by HLA-A,
B and DR at the molecular level, and both related and unre-
lated transplantations were included in the study cohort.
The patients received either TBI-based conditioning regi-
the diagnosis and staging of chronic GvHD, taking into ac-
count novel manifestations of chronic GvHD in the setting
of post-transplantation immunomodulation,3
and a key ele-
ment of this NCC diagnosis and staging is a global severity
rating of chronic GvHD based on the extent of each organ’s
involvement. Since the announcement of this most recent
diagnostic scheme, several authors have reported on a ret-
rospective reclassification of chronic GvHD utilizing the
NCC, based mostly on the adult hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) population, with conflicting results
on the prognostic utility of the NCC.4-6
Published reports on
the application of the NCC in the pediatric HSCT popula-
tion are lacking, yet the need for a standard and valid diag-
nostic scheme is urgent, considering the importance of ac-
curate reporting of chronic GvHD severity at diagnosis and
throughout treatment.
In this study, our objectives were twofold: first, we retro-
spectively reclassified chronic GvHD according to NCC in a

persistent acute GvHD as chronic GvHD,9
patients lacking
diagnostic GI criteria and complaining of common GI symp-
toms such as vomiting, diarrhea and weight loss were not
scored as having chronic GI GvHD unless a biopsy speci-
men proved otherwise.
Scoring of hepatic GvHD may also lend itself to inaccu-
racy as the NCC provides neither diagnostic nor distinctive
criteria for chronic liver GvHD, and scoring of liver in-
volvement is based on elevation of serum bilirubin or liver
enzymes, the etiology of which may be multifactorial.10
A
transient elevation of liver enzymes of greater than five
times the upper normal limit is sufficient for a score of 3
and hence, classification as severe chronic GvHD in a pa-
tient, even if other physical findings that are more diagnos-
tic for chronic GvHD are of mild severity. Yet, hepatic in-
volvement may be common enough to have a significant
impact on the severity rating of many of these patients.Aliv-
er biopsy may aid in diagnosing chronic liver GvHD with
greater certainty, but such a biopsy was not undertaken in
the cohort of patients. In order to resolve this problem, sever-
ity rating was done for each patient in two ways, both includ-
ing and without the organ score for hepatic involvement.
Chronic GvHD study endpoints
Two endpoints were used in this study to decide upon the fi-
nal outcome of chronic GvHD: duration of systemic IST, and
overall clinical status of chronic GvHD at last follow-up.
The duration of systemic IST for chronic GvHD, defined
from the date of chronic GvHD diagnosis to the end of sys-
temic IST, was calculated for each patient. Then, the NCC
global severity rating at chronic GvHD diagnosis was eval-
uated as a potential prognostic factor for predicting discon-
tinuation of systemic IST. Attempts were made to taper and
stop systemic IST within 18 months of initiation if the pa-
tient showed resolution of signs and symptoms.
The duration of systemic IST may not reflect the actual sta-
tus of chronic GvHD at the last follow-up as treatment may
continue despite clinical improvement of chronic GvHD
signs and symptoms. For a more direct indication of chron-
ic GvHD status, each patient’s chronic GvHD at the last
follow-up was classified as follows: ‘resolved’, indicating
eradication of all signs and symptoms of chronic GvHD
with systemic IST stopped; ‘controlled’, indicating improved
condition with continued or tapered IST; and ‘persistent’,
representing continued signs and symptoms of chronic
GvHD, or aggravation at last follow-up despite treatment.
Patient death that was directly related to chronic GvHD
mens (total body irradiation, cytarabine, cyclophospha-
mide) or non-TBI-based regimens (busulfan, cyclophos-
phamide; busulfan, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, anti-
thymocyte globulin (ATG); busulfan, fludarabine±ATG;
fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, ATG). GvHD prophylaxis
included either cyclosporine with 4 scheduled doses of
mini-dose methotrexate or cyclosporine alone. Administra-
tion of min-dose methotrexate was withheld with the devel-
opment of mucositis requiring analgesia.
The severity and extent of acute GvHD were graded ac-
cording to previous consensus criteria.7
With regards to the
temporal pattern of acute GvHD onset, delayed onset acute
GvHD (after day 100) as characterized in the NCC was re-
corded in an attempt to fully classify chronic GvHD into
the classic chronic GvHD and overlap syndrome subtypes.
Diagnosis and classification of chronic GvHD
Diagnosis
Retrospective diagnosis of chronic GvHD was based strict-
ly on the NCC. For the diagnosis of chronic GvHD in organs
that could prove more problematic, lung GvHD was diag-
nosed without a biopsy if the patient complained of symp-
toms such as cough and dyspnea, the radiologic findings on
the chest computed tomography were consistent with air
trapping without overt areas of consolidation, and the pa-
rameters on the pulmonary function test indicated an ob-
structive pattern of lung disease. Overall, in the diagnosis of
chronic lung GvHD, efforts were made to differentiate bron-
chiolitis obliterans syndrome from bronchiolitis obliterans or-
ganizing pneumonia.8
Diagnostic criteria for chronic GvHD of the GI tract were
limited to esophageal webs or strictures of the esophagus,
and other more common symptoms such as vomiting and
diarrhea did not qualify for a diagnosis of chronic GvHD.
Also, as outlined in the NCC, hyperbilirubinemia or ele-
vation of AST, ALT or other liver parameters alone were
not sufficient for the diagnosis of chronic GvHD.
Severity of chronic GvHD
After diagnosis of chronic GvHD, organ-specific scoring
and severity assignment as “mild”, “moderate”, and “se-
vere”, as outlined in the NCC, were done for each patient.
For strict classification of chronic GvHD, additional rules
were implemented for the scoring of GI tract GvHD and
hepatic GvHD. In light of the NCC’s classification of a de-
layed type of acute GvHD, and the potential to misdiagnose

univariate study included previous acute GvHD of grade II
or above (p<0.001), patient age (p=0.044), and underlying
disease (p=0.089) (Table 2). However, upon multivariate
analysis, only preceding acute GvHD of grade II or above
proved to have a significant impact on chronic GvHD inci-
dence (HR 5.79, 95% CI 2.06-16.24, p=0.001).
Diagnosis and classification of chronic GvHD
Diagnosis
The most common organ for diagnosis of chronic GvHD
was the oral cavity (N=15, 65%), followed by the skin (N=3,
13%), lungs (N=3, 13%) and eyes (N=2, 9%). At diagnosis,
one patient showed signs consistent with overlap syndrome
(diagnosis of ocular GvHD combined with persistent acute
skin GvHD), while the others were classified as classic
chronic GvHD.
Global severity at diagnosis
Initial global severity was evaluated in all patients both
with and without consideration of liver GvHD. With a strict
application of NCC and eliminating potential liver involve-
ment unconfirmed by biopsy, summation of initial global
severity resulted in 14 patients with mild (61%), six patients
with moderate (26%) and three patients with severe chronic
GvHD (13%). Inclusion of liver function abnormalities at
diagnosis as a manifestation of chronic GvHD led to five
patients with mild chronic GvHD being reclassified as hav-
ing moderate chronic GvHD, resulting in nine patients with
mild (39%), 11 with moderate (48%) and three with severe
chronic GvHD (13%).
Global severity at diagnosis and chronic GvHD
prognostic parameters
Duration of systemic IST
The median duration of systemic IST for the cohort was
501 days (range: 151-1,368). Sixteen of the 23 patients
(70%) had systemic IST stopped at last follow-up for a prob-
ability of systemic IST withdrawal at three years of 68.7%
(Fig. 1A). No significant relationship was found between
initial global severity of chronic GvHD and duration of sys-
temic IST (p=0.617) (Fig. 1B). Similarly, a second assess-
ment of initial global severity that included possible hepatic
GvHD did not alter the lack of association between initial
GvHD severity and duration of systemic IST (p=0.647)
(Fig. 1C).
was also recorded. Again, the NCC global severity rating at
chronic GvHD diagnosis was assessed as a prognostic fac-
tor for these definitions of chronic GvHD status.
Course of systemic IST for chronic GvHD
The number of organs involved and the actual sites of chron-
ic GvHD for each patient during the course of systemic IST
were recorded. Medications administered as systemic IST,
first-line therapy or otherwise, were also summarized.
An important event during the course of chronic GvHD
treatment is an increase in the dose of systemic IST, the ad-
dition of other immunosuppressive agents to those given
previously, or the reinstitution of systemic IST after previ-
ous withdrawal due either to aggravation of chronic GvHD
signs and symptoms or lengthy persistence without waning
despite treatment. Such ‘exacerbation’of chronic GvHD re-
quiring strengthened systemic IST have been reported to
show significant associations with survival endpoints.11,12
The number of such exacerbations, and the organs in which
these exacerbations occurred were analyzed in each patient.
Statistical analysis
The following factors were analyzed for possibly contribu-
tingto chronic GvHD incidence using a Cox proportional
hazards regression model: age of patient and donor, gender,
underlying disease, donor type, cell source, donor-recipient
sex mismatch, HLA-C mismatch, ABO mismatch, condi-
tioning regimen, GvHD prophylaxis, and preceding acute
GvHD of grade II or above. Risk factors for chronic GvHD
incidence with a p value of <0.1 on univariate study were
selected for multivariate analysis. Overall incidence of chron-
ic GvHD and probability of systemic IST withdrawal were
calculated using a cumulative incidence function with death
as a competing risk event. Comparisons of the probability
of systemic IST withdrawal according to the initial chronic
GvHD severity were done using Gray’s test. Correlations
between initial chronic GvHD severity and clinical response
to IST at the last follow-up were done using Fisher’s exact
test. The significance level was set at p<0.05. Statistical
analysis was done on R package, version 2.10.1 (available
at http://CRAN.R-project.org).

At the last follow-up, 16 patients (70%) showed resolution

Chronic GvHD exacerbation
Overall, 57 episodes of chronic GvHD exacerbation requir-
ing strengthened systemic IST occurred throughout the fol-
low-up period. Of these 57 episodes, 41 (72%) were treated
by increasing the dosage of the previously administered
IST, four (7%) were treated by adding another immunosup-
pressive agent to the previous regimen, 11 (19%) were treat-
ed by reinitiating systemic IST that had been stopped, and
one (2%) was treated by both increasing the dosage of the
previous IST and adding a second medication to the regimen.
Fifteen patients (65%) experienced at least one episode
of chronic GvHD exacerbation during the period of follow-
up. In these patients, the median number of chronic GvHD
exacerbations was four episodes (range: 1-10). With regards
to the organ in which chronic GvHD exacerbation occurred,
the oral cavity was the most common organ of exacerbation
with 35 episodes, followed by the lung with 13 episodes,
the skin with nine episodes, and the eye with three. Howev-
er, when this crude number of total exacerbation episodes
per organ was adjusted for the number of patients who ex-
perienced chronic GvHD in that specific organ, lung GvHD
showed the highest frequency of exacerbation, with 2.2 ex-
acerbations per patient, followed by oral GvHD with 1.6.
Clinical course of patients with chronic lung GvHD
The course of lung GvHD, which resulted in the highest
number of exacerbations per patient, was analyzed as a sub-
set (Table 4). All six patients with lung GvHD were 10 years
old or older at the time of HSCT, had underlying malignan-
cy, were recipients of PBSCT, and had experienced prior
acute GvHD. At the last follow-up, two patients had resolu-
tion of lung GvHD (withdrawal of systemic IST), three pa-
tients had control of lung GvHD, and one patient, who had
chronic GvHD involvement in five other organs, died. Sys-
temic IST was comprised of steroids+cyclosporine in five
patients, while one patient also received mycophenolate
mofetil for 10 months. Other supportive systemic agents in-
cluded macrolide antibiotics as anti-inflammatory agents,
xanthine derivatives, and β2-agonists, while inhaled ste-
roids and bronchodilators were also administered.
DISCUSSION
Although undertaken with a small cohort of patients, this
study has significance because it adds to the limited body of
research on the application of the NCC to children with
No significant correlation was noted between initial se-
verity at onset of chronic GvHD (without consideration of
possible hepatic GvHD) and response to IST at the last fol-
low-up (p=0.098) (Table 3). A similar lack of correlation
was also found between the initial severity of chronic GvHD
including assessment of hepatic GvHD, and final response
to IST (p=0.277).
Clinical course of chronic GvHD
Overall organ involvement
After initial diagnosis, the median number of organs involved
with chronic GvHD for each patient throughout the period of
follow-up was three (range: 1-6). Oral GvHD was the most
common manifestation (n=22), followed by skin (n=14), liver
(n=12), eye (n=10), lung (n=6), and joints (n=1) (Fig. 2).
Treatment of chronic GvHD
Systemic IST included steroids±calcineurin inhibitor in 22
patients (96%). Sixteen patients were treated with steroids
and cyclosporine, five were given steroids only, and one pa-
tient received steroids and cyclosporine alternate with ta-
crolimus. Only one patient (4%) was treated with a second-
line immunosuppressive agent for chronic GvHD: steroids
and cyclosporine combined with mycophenolate mofetil.

tient, treatment consisted of first line IST (steroid±calcineurin
inhibitor), further emphasizing the relatively positive response
to treatment of chronic GvHD in this cohort of children.
The median duration of systemic IST in our cohort was
501 days. Two previous studies on a cohort that included
adult HSCT recipients reported median systemic IST dura-
tions of 272 days15
and 23 months,16
but an accurate com-
parison with our study may not be possible due to the differ-
ent lengths of follow-up after diagnosis of chronic GvHD.
Notably, 65% of patients experienced at least one exacer-
bation of chronic GvHD necessitating systemic IST escala-
tion, with a median of four exacerbations in the subgroup
of patients with such an event. Considering that a maximum
of three such “flare-ups” per patient were documented in
one adult patient-based study,11
the number of exacerba-
tions per child is considerable and may represent attempts
to minimize steroid administration. Consistent with its poor
prognosis, lung GvHD resulted in the largest number of
such exacerbations when adjusted for the number of pa-
tients with site-specific involvement. However, in our cohort,
despite the high frequency of exacerbations, all but one pa-
tient with lung GvHD had either resolved or controlled
symptoms at the last follow-up, with first line IST as the
mainstay of treatment.
After lung GvHD, oral GvHD resulted in the most exac-
erbations per diagnosed patient. This result is perhaps not
surprising considering that the oral cavity was responsible
for the greatest number of initial chronic GvHD diagnoses,
as well as being the most commonly involved organ in over-
all chronic GvHD. However, the frequency with which oral
GvHD was encountered also emphasizes the need to mini-
chronic GvHD, as well as outlining in detail the clinical
course and response to systemic IST in children, especially
with regards to GvHD exacerbation requiring IST incre-
mentation.
With regards to risk factors for chronic GvHD incidence,
only antecedent acute GvHD of grade II or above proved to
have a significant impact on multivariate analysis. Previous
studies have shown that variables such as older patient age
and malignant disease also act as significant risk factors,13,14
and our results emphasize the pivotal role of previous acute
GvHD in subsequent chronic GvHD incidence. Also, upon
diagnosis of chronic GvHD, overlap syndrome as proposed
by the NCC was observed only in one patient, in contrast to
studies including adult patients in which this GvHD entity
accounted for a much greater proportion of post-day 100
GvHD.4,5
One important classification proposed by the NCC is a
global assessment of GvHD based on the severity of involve-
ment in each organ. Our study shows that such a global as-
sessment at initial diagnosis of chronic GvHD has prognos-
tic correlations with neither duration of systemic IST, which
is a commonly used endpoint in the study of chronic GvHD,
nor with the overall response to systemic IST at the end of
follow-up, a parameter that was defined specifically in this
study. In the pediatric HSCT population, the prognostic utili-
ty of the boundaries of global assessment may be blurred
by the more favorable outcome of chronic GvHD in children
as compared to adults, which was confirmed in our study in
which 83% of patients had either resolution of chronic
GvHD with discontinuation of systemic IST, or improved
symptoms with continued systemic IST. In all but one pa-

mize systemic IST escalation as a response to GvHD ag-
gravation, possibly through local therapeutic measures such
as topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors.17
Although more than 80% of the chronic GvHD cohort
had either resolution or control of symptoms at the last fol-
low-up, complications resulting from systemic IST remain
an important issue. Twelve patients (52%) were diagnosed
with either osteopenia or osteoporosis on post-transplanta-
tion bone densitometry. Other endocrine problems such as
growth hormone deficiency and gonadal deficiency were
also diagnosed. Long term evaluation of such problems re-
mains a critical part of chronic GvHD care, especially in
the pediatric setting.
One significant limitation of our data is the diagnostic un-
certainty of chronic hepatic GvHD due to lack of biopsy cor-
roboration. However, the NCC does not outline criteria for
the diagnosis of chronic GvHD through hepatic involvement
alone, and a diagnosis requires distinction from acute GvHD.
Hence, evaluation of global severity was done both with and
without incorporation of possible chronic hepatic GvHD for
a strict application of the NCC. Diagnosis of lung GvHD
also proved problematic, as none of our patients deemed to
have pulmonary involvement had undergone lung biopsy.
Another important limitation of our study was the small
number of children that formed the chronic GvHD cohort;
inclusion of more patients may have led to greater statistical
significance than can be currently extrapolated. The NCC
should, therefore, be given further evaluation in a larger co-
hort of children with chronic GvHD.
In conclusion, our evaluation of the NCC found the glob-
al assessment to have limited prognostic correlation with
valid chronic GvHD endpoints such as duration of systemic
IST, possibly due to the comparably favorable clinical course
of pediatric chronic GvHD.Although the majority of patients
in the cohort had chronic GvHD controlled at last follow-up,
multiple exacerbations were frequent in the course of treat-
ment. Trials of localized therapy, especially for oral GvHD,
are warranted as a first-line response to symptom aggravation
in order to minimize treatment-related complications.
