INTRODUCTION
Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a well established
treatment modality in severe aplastic anemia (SAA). In patients
with SAA who have HLA-identical, related donors, BMT is
usually considered the treatment of choice. The use of antithy-
mocyte globulin (ATG) or antilymphocyte globulin (ALG),
given alone (1) or together with high-dose prednisolone (2)
or androgens (3), is accepted as an effective form of treatment
for SAA patients who do not have a compatible donor. The
aim of the present study was to compare the treatment out-
comes of BMT and immunosuppressive therapy (IS) in pa-
tients with SAA at a single institution between 1990 and1999.
We speculated that the analysis of cases where modern sup-
portive care has been given would be more likely to yield reli-
able data as a comparison of two treatment modalities. Since
1985, the authors group, the hemato-oncology team in Seoul
National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea, has treated patient
with SAA via either immunosuppressive treatment or BMT
on the basis of the availability of a eligible bone marrow donor.
Because morbidity and mortality from BMT increase with
the patients age, BMT is not usually recommended for pati-
ents older than 50 yr of age. Thus, for older patients and for
patients who do not have a matched, related donor, immuno-
suppressive therapy is usually recommended as primary the-
rapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients eligible for this study were 96 patients diagnosed
as having SAA according to the International Aplastic Ane-
mia Study Group diagnostic criteria (4). These criteria include
the presence of at least two of the following three peripheral
blood findings: 1) a neutrophil count of less than 0.5 109
/L,
2) a corrected reticulocyte count of less than 1%, and 3) a pla-
telet count of less than 20 109
/L. And the marrow cellu-
larity less than 25% was added to the criteria. Among SAA,
a neutrophil count of less than 0.2 109
/L has been recognized
as a bad prognosis factor (5). So, such patients were further
classified as very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) group. Before
therapy, diagnoses were confirmed by aspirates and biopsies

The present study represents an analysis of 96 patients with severe aplastic ane-
mia (SAA) treated in Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea between 1990
and 1999. Twenty-two patients were treated by allogeneic bone marrow transplan-
tation (BMT) from HLA identical sibling donors and 74 by immunosuppressive ther-
apy (IS) with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or antilymphocyte globulin (ALG). There
was no statistical difference between the two treatment groups in age, sex, dis-
ease duration, and previous transfusion amount. In the BMT group, grade II-IV
acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) develeped in 10% and chronic GVHD
occurred in 33% of patient. Only one patient died from complication of transplan-
tation (veno-occlusive disease). Of 74 patients who received IS treatment, 45%
achieved a complete or partial response. Twenty patients died among IS treatment
group. Major causes of death were hemorrhage (40%) and infection (55%). In the
BMT group, the 5-yr overall survival (OS) was 95% after a median follow-up of 42
months. In the IS group, the 5-yr OS was 70% after a median follow-up of 49 mo-
nths (p=0.04). In conclusion, the long-term survival rates of SAA in Koreans receiv-
ing BMT or IS were excellent compared with the Western data. Further evalua-
tion on the prognosis of aplastic anemia in Asians should be done.

of bone marrow and by cytogenetic studies of bone marrow
cells. They were treated between January 1990 and Decem-
ber 1999. During the study period, we offered BMT to pati-
ents with SAA who were younger than 50 yr of age and had
HLA matched related donors. Patients without such donors
received IS therapy with an antithymocyte globulin-based or
antilymphocyte globulin-based regimen. Twenty-two patients
were given an HLA identical sibling transplant and 74 patients
were given IS. Patient characteristics by treatment group are
shown in Table 1. The groups were comparable in age, sex,
disease duration, previous red cell transfusion, absolute neu-
trophil count, and disease severity.
Treatment Regimens
Among 22 patients who received a bone marrow transplant,
17 were conditioned with cyclophosphamide and total lym-
phoid irradiation (CY/TLI). In CY/TLI regimen, patients
received CY 50 mg/kg, i.v. on each of four consecutive days
(total 200 mg/kg), followed by single-fraction 500 cGy TLI.
In two patients, besides cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg), unir-
radiated viable donor buffy coat cells after the bone marrow
infusion (CY/buffy) were used in an attempt to enhance engraft-
ment. Two patients received horse antihuman thymocyte glob-
ulin (30 mg/kg 3 days), in addition to cyclophosphamide
(CY/ATG). In one patient whose preceding disease was par-
oxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, busulfan and cyclophos-
phamide (BU/CY) were used as a conditioning regimen.
Busulfan (1 mg/kg according to the actual body weight) was
administered four times per day for four consecutive days
from day -7 to day -4. Cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg accord-
ing to the ideal body weight) was administered on days -3
and -2. Table 2 shows the conditioning regimens and engraft-
ment data of BMT recipients. In all patients, cyclosporin A
(CSA) and methotrexate (MTX) were used for prevention fo
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). It consisted of a short course
of MTX, 15 mg/m2
intravenously on day 1 and 10 mg/m2
on
days 3, 6, and 11, plus cyclosporine (3 mg/ kg/d), continu-
ous infusion since day 1. Conversion to oral CSA was done

when signs of gastrointestinal toxicity subsided, and the dose
was accommodated according to the CSA blood levels. CSA
was discontinued at 6 months after BMT unless the evidence
of GVHD was present. Acute GVHD was graded from 0 to
IV according to the Thomas criteria (6), and chronic GVHD
was defined and classified by the Sullivans criteria (7). Veno-
occlusive disease of the liver (VOD) was defined as an increase
in bilirubin level greater than 2 mg/dL with at least two of
three of the followings: hepatomegaly, ascites, and greater than
5% body weight gain (8).
Among 74 patients who received IS therapy, 38 (51%) pati-
ents received ATG 20 mg/kg/day by intravenous infusion for
eight consecutive days (ATG regimen); 17 (23%) patients,
ATG 40 mg/kg/day for four consecutive days combined with
cyclosporine from day 14 (5 mg/kg) (ATG/CSP regimen); 19
(26%) patients, ALG 10 mg/kg/day for five days (ALG regi-
men) (Table 4). Patients were premedicated with acetaminop-
hen 600 mg and diphenhydramine 50 mg and hydrocortisone
50 mg before ATG or ALG infusion. All patients received cor-
ticosteroidsduring ATG or ALG therapy to reduce side effects.
Criteria for response to immunosuppressive therapy
We defined nonresponders as patients whose peripheral
blood counts did not improve until day 180 and patients who
died before day 180. For responders, the degree of response
was assessed when the maximum improvement in peripher-
al blood counts occurred. The following definitions of response
were used: 1) complete responders attained a hematocrit of
35% or greater, an absolute neutrophil count of 1.0 109
/L
or greater, and a platelet count of 100 109
/L without trans-
fusion; 2) partial responders achieved a sustained improvement
in any of the following measurements: neutrophil count incre-
ment by 0.5 109
/L above the baseline, platelet count incr-
ement by 30 109
/L above the baseline, or no need for red
blood cell transfusions. Documentation of an improvement in
hematologic parameters required three or more values obtained
more than 1 week apart.
Stastical analysis
Overall survival curves were obtained using Kaplan-Meier
product-limit estimates, and comparisons between curves were
based on the log-rank statistic. All p values were two-sided.
Means were compared using Student t-test. Categoric vari-
ables were compared using chi-square test. The analysis was
performed on an IBM personal computer with SAS statistical
software.
RESULTS
Bone marrow transplantation
Engraftment was defined as an absolute neutrophil count
(ANC) >500/ L for three consecutive days, and independen-
cy of transfusion. All patients attained successful engraftment.
The median time to recovery of ANC to 500/ L was 17 days
after transplantation (range, 12-27 days), and platelet counts
to 20,000/ L and transfusion independency occurred 21 days
after transplantation (range 13-67 days). Only one patient
experienced marrow graft rejection at 75 days after transplan-
tation. She received a second transplantation from the same
*TRM: treatment-related mortality (death by causes other than relapse).

in a cured state.
Acute GVHD occurred in five patients (23%), but grade II
to IV acute GVHD has been seen in only two patients (10%,
II:1, III:1). Treatment of acute GVHD consisted of cortico-
steroid and cyclosporine, alone or in combination, but grade I
acute GVHD of skin was usually observed without treatment.
The resolution of GVHD was the rule in all cases. Chronic
GVHD, on the other hand, was observed in 7 out of 21 pati-
ents who survived more than 100 days posttransplant (33%,
limited in 4 and extensive in 3). Hepatic veno-occlusive dis-
ease (VOD) occurred in 2 out of 22 patients (9%). It was the
cause of death in one. Myelodysplastic syndrome or other he-
matologic malignancies were not developed in transplant re-
cipients. Other complications such as interstitial pneumoni-
tis (IP) were not noted. Table 3 shows the outcome of BMT.
Immunosuppressive therapy
The clinical response to IS therapy is shown in Table 4.
Responses were observed in 33 (45%) of 74 adult patients
treated with IS therapy including 16 (22%) with complete
and 17 (23%) with partial responses. No response was seen
in 41 patients (55%). Among 12 VSAA patients, 4 (33%)
were responders. Among the other SAA 62 patients, 29 (47%)
were responders. There was a tendency of a lower response
rate in VSAA, but it was not statistically significant. IS regi-
men did not influence the response rate, either. The response
rates were 53% in ATG/CSP regimen, 44% in ATG regimen,
and 37% in ALG regimen. Response to IS did not correlate
with the disease duration, previous RBC transfusion, patient
age, or sex.
Long-term complications of IS therapy included recur-
rent aplasia in 4 patients among 33 responding patients
(12%), evolution to a myelodysplastic syndrome or acute
leukemia in 2 (3%) patients, and appearance of paroxysmal
nocturnal hemoglobinuria in 2 (3%) patients (Table 4). The
probability of developing a clonal stem cell disorder after IS
therapy (4 of 74 patients) or BMT (0 of 22 patients) was dif-
ferent, but did not reach statistical significance.
Survival analysis
Fig. 1 illustrates the overall 5-yr survival of 96 patients
according to treatment: 95% for BMT and 70% for IS. The
difference was statistically significant (p=0.04). In the IS treat-
ment group, the survival correlated with response: at 5 yr, the
survival rates for responders and nonresponders were 95% and
51%, respectively (Fig. 2, p=0.0004). The response to IS was
the only factor associated with improved survival. In patients
receiving BMT, no factor was significantly associated with
improved survival. Disease severity and age did not influence
the survival rate in either groups. Two patients died in the
BMT group. Severe VOD was the cause of death in one and
the other died from traffic accident in a cured state. For patients
receiving IS treatment, infection and hemorrhage were major
causes of death (55% and 40% of deaths, respectively). Caus-
es of death for all patients are listed in Tables 3 and 4. Besides
survival rate, the quality of life of the two groups was different.
The surviving patients receiving BMT had a median Karnof-
sky score of 100%. By contrast, the median Karnofsky score
of the patients receiving IS was 80%.
DISCUSSION
During the study period, we offered BMT to patients
with SAA who were younger than 50 yr of age and had HLA
matched related donors. Patients without such donors received
IS therapy with an antithymocyte globulin-based or anti-
lymphocyte globulin-based regimen. The range of age dif-
fered between groups because there was no upper age restric-
tion for patients receiving IS therapy, however the difference
was not statistically significant. In the previous study, a high-

er absolute neutrophil count has been correlated with both an
increased rate of response to IS therapy and an increased sur-
vival rate (9). For patients receiving IS therapy, a higher absolute
neutrophil count may indicate that the bone marrow has a
reversible stem-cell injury and thus is capable of autologous
recovery. The association between a higher absolute neutrophil
count before treatment and improved survival of the patients
who received IS therapy was reported (SAA vs. VSAA; 47%
vs. 27% in 15-yr OS, p=0.002) (10). However this was not
observed in our series (SAA vs. VSAA; 71% vs. 67% in 5-yr
OS).
Experimental studies in animals and analysis of human
transplantation data suggest that transfusion-induced sensi-
tization to minor histocompatibility antigens is the princi-
pal pathogenic mechanism of marrow graft failure/rejection
(11, 12). The importance of restricting transfusion whenever
possible and of performing marrow transplantation as soon as
possible has been regarded as essential if a suitable donor is
available. But the majority of patients require blood transfu-
sion in the pretransplant period and such support should
not be withheld on the basis that future graft rejection risks
may be increased. In fact, small amounts of transfusion did
not influence the engraftment after BMT in several reports
(13, 14). In our series, all patients receiving BMT except one
patient had received multiple transfusions, however the rejec-
tion occurred in only one patient. In addition, there was no
difference in the survival rate according to the transfusion
amount. Thus, on the basis of our result, previous multiple
transfusions should not be regarded as a contraindication of
BMT. The transfusion amount did not influence the survival
rate in the IS group, either, as in our series.
Most studies have indicated that long-term survival of BMT
recipients is significantly lower for patients older than 20 yr
than for those who are younger (15). As explanations, in youn-
ger patients, GVHD incidence and severity are reduced and
graft rejection is rare. There are a couple of surprising points
in our results as far as age is concerned. Statistically there was
no survival difference according to age. Therefore, based on the
encouraging results of the present study, more liberal entry
into a marrow transplantation program may be acceptable if
age is the only unfavorable factor. Age, also, did not influence
the survival rate of IS group in our series.
Above-mentioned observations (pretreatment neutrophil
count, pretreatment transfusion amount, and patient age were
not correlated with survival rates in our series) have not been
documented in other reports, published in Western countries.
This might be due to the small sample size, but there is a some
possibility that the prognosis of aplastic anemia in Asians, at
least in Koreans, is very good. In fact the 5-yr OS rates for
patients receiving BMT and IS were 95% and 70%, respec-
tively, in our series. In other published papers about Korean
patients with SAA (16, 17), similar good results were report-
ed. In these papers, the overall survivals were 80% (patients
receiving BMT), 97% (patients responding to IS therapy), and
45% (patients not responding to IS therapy). By contrast, actu-
arial survival rates in the European Bone Marrow Transplan-
tation Registry for patients receiving BMT and IS were infe-
rior to our results (63% and 61%, respectively, at 6 yr) (5). In
another Western report (18), similar results (72% for BMT
and 45% for IS) was observed. There have been a few reports
suggesting that the race of the recipients is a factor of prog-
nostic relevance especially in transplantation (19-21). Accord-
ing to the Klingemanns report, Black patients transplanted
for aplastic anemia had a significantly lower incidence of sus-
tained engraftment and inferior survival when compared with
Caucasians and Asians. And Asian patients with SAA who
received BMT had a tendency of higher survival rate compared
with Caucasians and Blacks. There was a tendency of a lower
incidence of graft failure in Asians compared to Caucasians
(12.5% vs. 19%), but the difference did not reach a statisti-
cal significance. Another explanation for a superior result of
BMT recipients in our series compared with Western BMT
recipients is that the incidence of acute GVHD was very low.
The low incidence of early death of BMT recipients (1/22, 5%)
in this series might be due to the low incidence (2/22, 9%)
of acute GVHD. Thus, it might have contributed to the long-
term survival of BMT recipients.
Immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin
or antilymphocyte globulin is used as an alternative to BMT.
Long-term follow-up reports from the European SAA Work-
ing Party, however, showed no survival plateau has yet been
achieved (22). Development of a clonal malignant disease was
even noted in 14% of patients who survived longer than 2 yr.
Compared to BMT, uncertain curability and probability of
secondary hematologic malignancies are known as unfavorable
factors of IS therapy.
Thirty-three out of 74 patients (45%) treated at our insti-
tution responded to IS therapy. This figure is quite similar to
that in a previous report (22). Several early attempts to improve
the outcome of ATG-treated patients were not successful. Re-
peated administration of ATG did not improve response or
survival rates (23). A randomized placebo-controlled trial at
UCLA showed no difference in response or survival rates be-
tween patients treated with ATG and androgens compared
with those receiving ATG alone (24). The combined use of
cyclosporine and ATG resulted in significantly improved re-
sponse rates compared with ATG administration alone in a
randomized study by the German Aplastic Anemia Group,
but differences in survival were not observed between the treat-
ment groups (25). In our study, we used three regimens of IS,
i.e., ATG alone, ALG alone, and ATG combined with cyclo-
sporine. There were no differences in response and survival
rate.
Crump et al. (26) recently conducted a trial in which all
adult SAA patients were initially treated with immunosup-
pressive therapy and only those who did not respond were
considered for BMT. This strategy resulted in an 80% 5-yr
actuarial survival rate for 31 aplastic anemia patients. In our
Severe Aplastic Anemia: BMT vs. Immunosuppressive Therapy 369
series, the OS of responders to IS therapy was 95%, and it was
comparable to the BMT group. So, the authors think that IS
therapy as a primary treatment is a plausible option, especial-
ly in high-risk patients. The BMT salvage approach may be
appropriate for patients with moderate aplastic anemia or for
a subset of SAA patients who are at increased risk for BMT-
related complications. Further study should be done on this
point.
As previously mentioned, the long-term survival rate in the
IS group (70%) in our series is superior to the Western results.
The authors think that two factors have contributed to this.
One is that the incidence of recurrent aplasia in our series (4/
33, 12%) was lower than those of the Western reports (32%
and 36%, respectively) (10, 27). The other is that the incidence
of clonal evolution such as acute myelogenous leukemia or
myelodysplastic syndrome (3%) was very low compared with
those of the Western reports (13% and 9%, respectively) (10,
18). These low incidences of late complications might result
in excellent long-term survival rate in patients receiving IS.
Further studies on the characteristics of aplastic anemia in
Asians should be done.
The use of immunosuppressive therapy and BMT has dra-
matically improved the survival of aplastic anemia patients.
Refinements in the use of these treatment modalities and
supportive care will further enhance the long-term outlook
for aplastic anemia patients.
