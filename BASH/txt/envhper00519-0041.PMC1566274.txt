This article is a discussion of occupational cancer in Italy. The introduction provides the necessary
context of Italian industrialization and occupational health regulation. This is followed by a review
of Italian epidemiologic studies of occupational cancer risks considered in terms of relative
measures of risk and attributable risk of carcinogenic agents or exposure circumstances. We
attempt to establish the number of workers exposed to carcinogens in Italy and the intensity of
their exposures. Finally, the Italian system of compensation for occupational cancer is discussed.
Several cohort and case-control studies have addressed the issue of occupational risks, mostly
among male workers. The results of these studies suggest that the growing incidence of and
mortality by mesothelioma is explained by the widespread and intense exposure to asbestos in
some Italian industrial settings. A high attributable risk of lung tumors among male populations in
industrial areas of northern Italy is explained by occupational exposures. However, insufficient
data are available for clear definition of the extent and intensity of occupational exposure to
carcinogenic substances. In Italy, we must prioritize and maximize resources in occupational
cancer epidemiology and revitalize the role of national institutions. Recent legislation has
established new regulations on the handling of carcinogenic substances in industrial settings, a
new list of occupational diseases, and a national registry of mesothelioma linked to asbestos
exposure. These legislative changes are expected to have positive effects. - Environ Health

Background
Industializaton
In Italy the Industrial Revolution began in
the early nineteenth century, considerably
later than in other European countries such
as England, France, and Germany. It first
affected the textile and metallurgical indus-
tries in the North. The production demands
for the two World Wars accelerated indus-
trial development, which progressed at a
tremendous pace after the 1950s. Italy's
entrance into the European Economic
Community (EEC) in 1957 stimulated
development of the automobile industry,
mechanical and precision metalworking,
and the chemical industry.

Thus, northern Italy developed an
industrial structure comparable to those of
other areas of northwestern Europe; south-
ern Italy, however, retained its original
agricultural orientation. This gap between
the industrial development of the North
and that of the rest of the country per-
sisted, even though some large metallurgi-
cal enterprises and chemical facilities
settled in the South.
Italy is remarkable for good manufac-
turing based on unskilled labor and for
exploiting few of her own raw materials,
although there has been mining of asbestos
(chrysotile), bauxite, coal, iron, lead, mer-
cury, pyrites, sulfur, and talc. Italy also has
a longstanding shipping tradition, and
there are dockyards in both the North and
the South.
In the 1960s the Italian Industrial
Revolution got a second wind in the rapid
growth of small- and medium-size indus-
tries. Small firms producing the same prod-
uct tended to cluster in particular areas.
Large firms broke up into networks of
smaller specialized artisan or family-run
enterprises. These specialized enterprises
employed local labor, so that particular areas
became known for producing products
such as ceramics, tiles, eye glasses, shoes,
silk dyeing, furniture, or tinned food.
Thus, by the end of the 1960s, most
Italian firms were small or medium size;
40% of the work force worked in enter-
prises employing 11 to 500 workers, and 3
million workers were artisans. In the
1970s, 7 million Italians were industrial
workers, 1.2 million were employed in
agriculture, 3.3 million in tertiary activi-
ties, and 1.8 million in public administra-
tion. A further 7 million were believed to
be involved in the underground ("black")
economy, meaning they worked in unregis-
tered firms or without paying for social
security. One million ofthese workers were
working two or even three jobs simultane-
ously. Women were an important part of
this underground work force (1).
Subsequent census data suggest that
important changes in the distribution ofthe
work force have taken place since the
1970s. Between the 1970s and the 1990s,
the number ofpeople working in office jobs
doubled, and there was a 10% reduction in
both the agricultural and the industrial
work force (2,3) (Table 1).
Women worked in selected industrial
and agricultural jobs but were virtually
absent in other sectors. In some cases this
was because these jobs were traditionally
reserved for men and in others it was
because of regulations. For example,
women could not be employed in mining,
in physically demanding jobs, or, during
pregnancy, in jobs involving exposure to
agents with a reproductive hazard.
In the early twentieth century and
again during the autarchy era of the 1940s,
poverty forced many workers and their
families to migrate to other European
countries or overseas. Between 1876 and
1985, 26 million Italians emigrated,
mainly from the South and the mountain-
ous areas of northern Italy. In addition,
there was a great deal of seasonal and tem-
porary migration of Italians workers, who
thus became known as birds of passage.
Abroad, they were employed in dangerous
jobs, where they often contracted occupa-
tional diseases. An example of this is the
persistence of high mortality rates in Italy
due to silicosis (4). The economic boom of

Reglation ofCacidnogenicExpsue
inWorkplaces
Since its introduction, Italian legislation on
workers' health protection has been domi-
nated by the concept oftechnologic feasibil-
ity. The early model of worker protection
stressed the need to update technology
rather than the need to control levels of
exposure in the factory. A notable exception
was the introduction of legislation on min-
ing and tunneling in the 1950s. The law
required periodic measurement of dust and
of the proportion of free silica in respirable
dust, lung X-rays for exposed workers, and
establishment of an independent body of
inspectors. The data collected by these
inspectors have never been submitted to for-
mal validation except in specific instances.
This indicates that the epidemiology of
occupational diseases and exposure assess-
ment was a low priority in Italy until the
late 1970s.
Exposures were measured more exten-
sively after the 1970s in response to union
demand. The battle for a better work
environment was thus limited to large facto-
ries, mostly in the North, in which the
unions had a strong voice; i.e., it was limited
to relatively few industrial populations.
The concept of acceptable levels was
not introduced until the late 1970s, when
EEC directives established acceptable levels
for some carcinogenic agents such as
asbestos, benzene, vinyl chloride, and some
aromatic amines. Legislation was recently
introduced on carcinogenic exposures at
work. Only during the last 15 years has
there been a decrease in intensity of expo-
sures at workplaces; this has been docu-
mented in the cases of asbestos, mercury,
and styrene (5-8).
Few chemicals have been banned in
Italy because of their carcinogenic risk. In
1964 benzene was prohibited in the manu-
facture of glues and varnishes because of
the high number of leukemia cases
detected among shoemakers, printers, and
rubber workers. Some aromatic amines
were banned because of the high relative
risk of bladder tumors among dyestuff
workers exposed to o-toluidine and 4,4'-
methylenebis(2-methylaniline) (9).
Other carcinogenic agents were prohib-
ited for agricultural uses (arsenic, mercury,
2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid), after
similar bans had been applied in other
countries. Finally, in 1992 Italy banned the
production, commercialization, and import
ofall asbestos fibers.
Until 1978, a technical body of the
Labour Ministry was in charge of inspect-
ing factories and verifying the application
of laws and regulations. At that time, the
prevention of occupational diseases was a
low priority because of limited resources
and the prevailing emphasis on the pre-
vention of accidents in the workplace. In
the 1978 health reform legislation, the
responsibility for the evaluation of occu-
pational health was transferred to the
Ministry of Health. Thereafter, a network
of occupational health units was devel-
oped as part of the National Health
Service. These units were aimed specifi-
cally at the detection and prevention of
occupational disease and had the right to
inspect workplaces. However, they were
not adequately supported and maintained
in southern Italy, and there was a lack of
central coordination.

OCCUPATIONAL CANCER IN ITALY
Review of Italian
Epidemiologic Studies on
Occupational Cancer Risk
Cohort and Case-Control Studies
In this section, we present a systematic
review of Italian studies on the association
between cancer and agents or activities in
the workplace. These studies appeared in
peer-reviewed journals between 1975 and
1994. They were traced by a search
through MEDLINE and CANCERLIST.
Case-series and descriptive epidemiologic
studies are excluded from this review.
However, the results of several descriptive
studies on mesotheliomas will be discussed
because they are directly relevant to
occupational cancer risks.
Most epidemiologic studies on occupa-
tional cancer risks were conducted from
1975 to 1994 because the discipline
emerged in Italy after the mid-1970s. This
review presents estimates of attributable
risk among the exposed (ARe) and the
general population (ARp).
A number of cohort studies (Tables
2-4) (10-78) and case-control studies
(Table 5) (79-122) have been published.
These two types of studies share several
characteristics: the populations studied were
primarily in northern and central Italy, the
studies were often conducted in coopera-
tion with the occupational health units of
the National Health Service; the studies
tended to be small (33% of cohort studies
were based on less than 20,000 person-years
offollow-up).
The cohort studies (Table 2) began ear-
lier and are more numerous than the case-
control studies. Because employee records
are kept in factories, cohort studies are fea-
sible and can attain a satisfactory level of
completeness and accuracy, with munici-
palities cooperating in providing the vital
status of subjects and, where appropriate,
the cause of death. However, inadequate
exposure data impaired exposure assessment
(only 36% of cohort studies had hygiene
data collected at the factories under investi-
gation). Rarely has a cohort study been
conducted in a large factory or in a number
of factories exposed to the same risk. The
notable exceptions are those conducted in
cooperation with the International Agency
for Research on Cancer on vinyl chloride
producers and on workers exposed to
styrene in reinforced plastic manufacturing
plants. Often the agents under study were
those for which the evidence of carcino-
genicity in humans was already defined.
Most studies were ofmale subjects.
Cohort studies often detected elevated
risks for all cancer mortality-up to rela-
tive risk (RR) of2.7-because ofhigh risks
of tumors of the respiratory tract (RR val-
ues from 1.5 to 6.9 for lung cancer; from
5.6 to 150 for primary pleural cancer; from
1.8 to 4.5 for cancer of the larynx). The
highest RR values were detected for pri-
mary pleural cancer among workers
exposed to asbestos and for cancer of the
bladder (RR values up to 30.6) among
dyestuff producers (Table 3). These risk
estimates suggest that the intensity ofoccu-
pational exposure to some carcinogenic
agents has been very high in the past.
In cohort studies that use the general
population as a reference, lack of data
about patterns of exposure to risk factors
and confounding factors in the general
population can lead to spurious estimates
ofattributable risk (AR).
Cohort studies can be used, however, to
compute estimates of AR among the
exposed (ARe: RR -1/RR x 100) (Table
4). It is not surprising, considering that
only studies with significantly increased
RR values are reported in Table 3, that
high ARe were derived. An ARe ofapproxi-
mately 100% for pleural cancer was found
among those exposed to asbestos and for
bladder tumors among those exposed to
dyestuffs. ARe values ranging from 33 to
8% for lung cancer and 23 to 58% for all
cancers were observed among those
exposed to asbestos, silica, and polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
For case-control studies, we report AR
values. Occasionally, we estimated the AR
percentage in the population (AR,p) from
case-control studies on the basis of the fol-
lowing formula: AR%= (OR -1)/OR x Pe,
where OR is the age-adjusted odds ratio and
Pe is the proportion ofexposed cases. This is
the only approach that was feasible because
direct access to the data was not possible.
Among the Italian case-control studies,
a few produced estimates ofAR values for
nasal cancer from wood and leather dust
exposures and for pleural cancer from
asbestos exposure. A more substantial num-
ber of case-control studies of lung cancer
have been specifically aimed at computing
AR values from occupational exposures
(Table 5). For unbiased estimates, the
studies on lung cancer were based on popu-
lation, and the probability and intensity of
exposure was evaluated by hygienists from
working histories derived from face-to-face
interviews. These studies, carried out in
northern Italy from 1983 to 1992, investi-
gated the incidence or mortality in the male
population from 1976 to 1986. We made
no attempt to combine the results of these
studies, even though this might have been
useful (123). In the general male population
(the study base), the ARp for lung cancer
from occupational agents evaluated as car-
cinogenic to humans varied from 12 to
39%. Estimates increased to ARp 25.5 to
48.1% when exposure to agents "probably"
carcinogenic to humans were included.
Occupational exposure to asbestos explains
the largest percentage ofARp in two studies
(20% oflung cancer in the male population
in the dockyard town ofTrieste in northern
Italy; 50% of respiratory cancer in the male
population of a restricted area of northern
Italy where most of the work force of a fac-
tory was recruited) (102,111,112). Among
those exposed, the AR values varied from 31
to 84% for occupational exposure to agents
that have been proven to be carcinogenic.
Exposure to leather dust resulted in a
very high ARp (92%) for nasal cavity can-
cers in a population-based case-control
study performed in an area where shoe
manufacturing was the dominant industry
(90). An ARe up to 80% was reported
among subjects occupationally exposed to
both leather and wood dust in a hospital-
based study involving several areas where
employment was predominantly in shoe
and furniture production (114).
Only one population-based case-control
study on bladder cancer has been done in
Italy to date, although there have been
several hospital-based studies. The popu-
lation-based study was carried out in an
industrialized area near Genoa. No estimate
has been made ofARp due to exposures to
risk factors ofindustrial origin; however, sig-
nificant excesses due to dyestuff production
and PAHs have been observed (99).
A limitation of ARs is that they are
time- and place-specific, i.e., they express
exposure circumstances of the location and
the time in which each study was con-
ducted. If studies are conducted in areas
with a high prevalence ofhigh-risk occupa-
tions, the estimates could overestimate the
risks among other populations or at the
national level. However, as previously
mentioned several areas of Italy are highly
specialized in similar productions, and esti-
mates derived in any of these areas should
be reasonably expended in others.
Record-Lnk-age Studies
In recent years, some surveys on mortality
alone have linked occupation or most
recent job (as recorded in census findings)
with mortality (as recorded on death

certificates) among subjects economically
active at the time of the census. In one of
these studies, deaths that occurred from
November 1981 to April 1982 in Italy
among approximately 13 million residents
18 to 64 years of age at the time of the
1981 census were analyzed using a
case-control approach (124). In another
study, 435,609 residents ofTurin 18 to 64
years of age, as listed in the 1981 census
records, were followed until 1989 (125).
The national study had a significant
percentage of unlinked subjects (16%),
and its results may be distorted by a selec-
tion bias due to the short follow-up time
and its proximity to the census. Cause-
specific RR values by occupation were
estimated as sex- and age-adjusted Mantel-
Haenzel odds ratios (all causes of death
except the one of interest included in the
referent series; all occupations other than
the one of interest classified as nonex-
posed). In the Turin study, sex-, age-, and
cause-specific standard mortality ratios
(SMRs) were computed using the rates of
the whole population under study to
obtain expected deaths. Subjects who
migrated from the area after the census
were not followed up (15.4%).
The studies provided information on
12 occupational categories indcluding farm-
ing, mining, and the chemical, metal, tex-
tile, leather and shoe, rubber, and plastics
and 44 specific causes of death including
several cancer sites, myocardial infarction,
respiratory diseases, cirrhosis, accidents.
Separate studies have been done on women
(126) and farmers (127).
Manual workers were shown to have a
significantly higher relative risk of mortal-
ity than nonmanual workers (125).
Increased RR values for several cancer sites
were observed in several occupations: lung
cancer in metal, iron and steel, and trans-
port workers; and liver cancer in rubber-,
chemical-, and trade-sector workers.
A summary ARp of all the statistically
significant excesses of lung cancer that
could be attributed to occupational differ-
ences was attained by calculating the
number of excess deaths for each profes-
sion showing an RR greater than 1 (p <
0.01 and more than five deaths observed)
and the proportion of such excess deaths
in respect to all observed deaths. These
AR values were not derived from either
estimates of exposures to predefined
chemicals or agents or from the entire
working history of each subject. The
higher value from lung cancer observed in
the Italian population (ARp, 6%) com-
pared to the value observed in the popula-
tion of Turin (AR, 4%) is surprising
because Turin is a lighly industrialized
area. However, considering the follow-up
period in the national study, this might
indicate a greater intensity in earlier expo-
sures. Despite the limitations of these
studies, the results confirm that a signifi-
cant percentage of lung tumors have
resulted from occupational exposures,
even in recent times.

Mesothelioma Due to Asbestos
in Italy
The mining of asbestos in Italy began
in 1870. The Balangero mine in the
northern Italian Alps was a rich source of
chrysotile, and this availability encouraged
Italian consumption of raw asbestos. Both
amosite and crocidolite have been exten-
sively used in Italy. For example, amosite
was used in pipe insulation and in ship-
yards as insulation applied in spray form;
crocidolite (which was not banned until
1986) was used as insulation for railway
carriages and was also applied in spray
form. The consumption of raw asbestos
increased sharply after the 1950s, when it
became comparable to that of the United
Kingdom and France. However, it was not
until the 1970s that the intensity of expo-
sure to asbestos in workplaces began to
be controlled.
The cancer registries of Genoa and
Trieste are now recording the world's
highest incidence rates of mesothelioma
(pleural and peritoneal combined) among
males: 5 + 0.4 and 6.36 + 0.85 age-stan-
dard rate x 100,000 (world population as
standard), respectively (128). High inci-
dent rates of mesothelioma have also been
266
observed in the female populations of both
cities (0.92 + 0.17 and 0.56 + 0.25,
respectively); that of Genoa's female popu-
lation is the highest worldwide. Because
women do not work in shipyards of either
city, environmental exposures would
appear to be the most plausible explana-
tion for this high incidence of meso-
thelioma (128).
High rates of mortality from primary
pleural tumors were observed in several
shipyard areas of Italy: Trieste, Genoa,
Gorizia, Venice, La Spezia, Taranto,
Leghorn, and Naples. They were also
observed in areas of Piedmont and
Lombardy where asbestos has been used in
textile production, automobile brakes, and
in asbestos cement manufacture (129). A
positive correlation was observed between
areas with high mortality rates from pleural
and peritoneal tumors (130) and areas in
which numerous compensations have been
awarded (131).
The high rates of mesothelioma
detected in descriptive epidemiologic
studies have been investigated and
explained as being the result of high
risks among shipyard, asbestos cement
manufacturers, and textile asbestos workers
(11,132-135).
Attempts to Estimate the
Number of Workers Exposed
to Carcinogens and the
Intensity of Their Exposures
Systematic data on the number of workers
exposed to carcinogens are not available in
italy. Estimates have been made in the con-
text of population-based case-control
studies (Table 4). These studies, however,
have been conducted for the most part in
northern Italy, and the data they provide are
rather heterogeneous because of the various
methods of exposure assessment used. It is
difficult, therefore, to judge whether results
ofthese studies reflect genuine differences or
merely differences ofapproach.
To overcome this difficulty, we have
chosen three recent studies in which study
designs were similar (population-based
case-control studies, with control groups
that are random samples of the general
population) (112,136) and whose com-
mon methodology led to a particular accu-
racy in the assessment of exposure. We
have reconsidered the original data of these
studies, one of which was on cancer of the
larynx, one on hematolymphopoietic
malignancies, and one on lung cancer. The
study on cancer of the larynx used the

OCCUPATIONAL CANCER IN ITALY
work histories since 1944 of 799 randomly
selected male controls residing in the heav-
ily industrialized areas ofTurin and Varese.
The study on hematolymphopoietic malig-
nancies analyzed the lifetime occupations
of 1,386 controls (731 men and 655
women) from nine areas of Italy. The
study on lung cancer analyzed the lifetime
work histories of 755 male controls from
Trieste. Information about risk factors was
collected through person-to-person inter-
views. In all three studies, job titles and
economic activities were coded with the 5-
digit International Standard Classification
of Occupations (137) and/or the 4-digit
International Standard Classification of all
Economic Activities (138,139). A team of
industrial hygienists (or agronomists, in the
case of the first study) assessed the proba-
bility of a person being exposed to various
agents on an ordinal scale (i.e., unexposed,
possibly exposed, certainly exposed,
certainly exposed at high levels).
There has been a historical develop-
ment in the methods for exposure assess-
ment in the context of population-based
studies. The study of hematolympho-
poietic malignancies, in particular, reflects
this development, which consisted of
a) the use ofjob-specific forms (in addition
to the general occupational history) in
occupational interviews, and b) the stan-
dardization of exposure assessment proce-
dures by experts, including the evaluation
ofinter-rate agreement (136).
We used only a fraction of the infor-
mation available in these studies for our
estimates. In our preliminary analysis of
the study of hematolymphopoietic malig-
nancies, for example, we only considered
the frequency of having been certainly
exposed. More detailed information on
intensity and probability will be forthcoming
in future studies.
In the study of cancer of the larynx,
7.8% of subjects were certainly exposed to
asbestos in their work histories. This is
because the study was carried out in heavily
industrialized areas. Exposure began
around 1944 and was mainly in the metal
products industry.
In the study of hematolymphopoietic
malignancies, 35 men (4.8%) and 6 women
(1%) were certainly exposed to asbestos.
Since about 1954, the construction indus-
try was the employment sector in which
more frequently exposure occurred; 26 men
(3.5%) and 4 women (0.6%) were certainly
exposed to benzene. Among the men, most
of these exposures occurred before 1964
(when the law was changed), and only four
exposures began after that date (three in
construction and one in the metal industry).
The lung cancer study in Trieste
assessed the cancer risk from exposure to
asbestos (used in shipbuilding, Trieste's
largest single industry) and PAHs (used
mainly in steel foundries and metal work-
ing, both ofwhich are also large employers
in the area). Ninety-four of the 755 con-
trols (12%) were certainly exposed to
asbestos and 36 (3.4%) were certainly
exposed to PAHs.
These three studies have limitations:
they considered only a few carcinogens,
they studied a relatively small number of
subjects, and the areas where they were
conducted were not selected to be repre-
sentative of the general Italian population.
It is possible nevertheless to make some
comments on asbestos exposure in Italy in
the light ofthe results ofthese studies.
The proportion of controls exposed to
asbestos varies between 12% in an area
dominated by a single industry (shipbuild-
ing) and 4.8% in the combined results
from nine areas with different levels of
industrialization (induding areas in central
and southern Italy). The intermediate
value of 7.8% in Varese and Turin makes
sense, when considering the previously
mentioned extremes. Furthermore, the
results suggest that the construction indus-
try is the source of workers' more recent
exposure to asbestos.
Compensation for
Occupational Cancer
Italy has had a system for compensation for
injuries in the workplace since 1898 and for
occupational diseases since 1934. This sys-
tem is based on the principle that the work-
place can be hazardous and employees must,
therefore, be insured under a national insur-
ance program at the employer's expense, the
cost to be determined by the extent of the
estimated risk. Ifa worker has an accident or
contracts an occupational disease, the cost
of treatment will be reimbursed to the
National Health System by the insurers.
The worker will receive compensation if he
is disabled to the extent that his original
capacity to work is decreased by 1 1 % or
more; he is also compensated ifhis employer
did not pay the insurance.
However, the system has always differen-
tiated between compensation for accidents
and compensation for diseases. The category
ofaccidents at work is rather broad, includ-
ing those in itinere, whereas diseases are
more strictly defined as those caused by
work. Furthermore, the percentage of
disablement as a result ofan accident is easier
to calculate than that caused by diease.
Since 1988, Italy has had a mixed
system for compensating for occupational
diseases. A list has been compiled of occu-
pational diseases and the right to compen-
sation if a causal link is proven between an
exposure and a disease (140). Items on the
list fall into two distinct group-one in
which the disease can vary but the etiologic
agent is clearly defined (e.g., diseases
caused by lead); and one in which both the
disease and the agent are clearly defined
(e.g., skin diseases caused by cement). A
similar distinction is made among occupa-
tional cancers, for example, diseases caused
by chromium (lung cancers among those
exposed to hexavalent chromium could be
included in this category) and mesothe-
lioma caused by asbestos (in which both
the cancer and the agent are specified).
The current list was introduced in 1994.
It includes 58 categories for industrial and
27 for agricultural activities (140). A dis-
tinction is thus made between industrial and
agricultural claims. Agricultural workers get
less compensation; they have only been
compensated for occupational diseases since
1958. This difference in compensation is
only partly explained by genuine differences
in exposure situations. The current list
devotes far more space to occupational
cancer than the previous list. It includes all
occupational exposures recognized by the
International Agency ofResearch on Cancer
and the Italian National Toxicology
Committee as having "sufficient evidence"
ofcarcinogenicity.
Limitations ofthe Italian system ofcom-
pensation for occupational cancer are the
following: it is extremely rigid, it allows few
workers actually to receive compensation,
and it tends to discourage daims. We con-
sider each ofthese problems individually.
The Italian system is rigid because it has
shown little ability to evolve over time in
response to new knowledge and conditions.
The list of diseases for which one can be
compensated has been revised only 6 times
since its introduction in 1934. The 1994
list replaced a list on the books since 1975.
Italian legislation does not require regular
updating of the list, and there is no perma-
nent independent committee of experts to
suggest change whenever the need arises.
Lack of consideration on new epidemio-
logic findings linking exposures and dis-
eases has meant that new diseases are not
added to the list when they should be. A
striking example of this is mesothelioma
due to occupational asbestos exposure:

May 1999 267
MERLER ET AL.
mesothelioma, in the absence of asbestosis
(which was listed), was not included in the
list until 1994 (141). For decades before
that, studies on mesothelioma in Italy
clearly argued for the need to update the
compensation system for cancer caused
by asbestos.
Few Italian workers actually receive
compensation for occupational cancer
(Table 6) (142). Since 1988 when the
mixed system was introduced, 53% of the
466 daims for cancer have been rejected by
the insurer in charge of the largest number
ofindustrial workers. Fortunately, the 1994
list could be applied to past claims still
under scrutiny, so the number of awards
has recently increased. Nevertheless, many
claimants have been turned away. The long
latency period of occupational diseases, the
low profile that the National Health System
gives to the link between diseases and occu-
pational exposures, and the lack ofan active
search for occupational diseases and of
proper registries for some of those already
known all help explain the low number of
requests for compensation.
Finally, the Italian system ofcompensa-
tion actually discourages claims. No effort
is made to inform workers of their rights.
Instead, the system maintains a passive
attitude of replying to requests if there are
any. If a claim is made, a worker cannot
approach the system as an individual. The
assistance of trade union institutes is usually
needed to follow the overall process from
daim to the final decision on compensation.

Finally, some working populations are
dealing with special insurers. Recently, rail-
way workers affected by mesotheliomas due
to occupational exposures to asbestos reacted
energetically against this state of affairs.
When, even after 1994, all requests for
compensation were denied, railway workers
and their relatives went to court to over-
turn the rejections oftheir insurance claim.
Conclusions
The extent and severity of occupational
cancer in Italy cannot be adequately
described because of lack of information
on the number of workers exposed to car-
cinogenic substances, the intensity of these
exposures, and the variation over time. No
inquiry has been made at the national level,
and any such inquiry would encounter dif-
ficulties in finding, compiling, and inter-
preting information collected at the local
level by the occupational health units of
the National Health Service. The National
Institute of Occupational Health has a low
profile, and funding ofprojects on occupa-
tional cancer risks has been too modest.
Some epidemiologic research has been
done nonetheless (Tables 2-5) to investi-
gate causal associations between exposure
and disease where an agent is suspected of
being a carcinogenic risk or of quantifying
the impact of exposures to known carcino-
gens. However, few ofthese studies investi-
gated the same risk in various industries
and few attained sufficient statistical power
and/or a gradient in exposure intensities.
The largest Italian industries-produc-
ers of cars, chemicals and petrochemicals,
pharmaceuticals, etc.-have not been the
subject of epidemiologic studies on cancer
risk because they did not wish to partici-
pate in such studies. Companies known to
use carcinogens often avoid or impede epi-
demiologic studies because they do not
appreciate the public health benefit and
fear liability.
The planned extension of record-link-
age studies may constitute an alternative
way to obtain new epidemiologic data.
Italy should follow the example of other
countries that require firms upon liquida-
tion to release their employee records to
national institutes.
Italy needs to prioritize and maximize
resources in occupational cancer epidemi-
ology and to revitalize the role of national
institutions. A national registry of
mesotheliomas linked to asbestos exposure
has recently been established on the sugges-
tion of a European Directive. A national
registry of cancer cases suspected to be of
occupational origin has been recom-
mended in the legislation on carcinogenic
substances at work. If these projects are
pursued, we can expect a positive effect on
the prevention and diagnosis of and com-
pensation for occupational cancers.
