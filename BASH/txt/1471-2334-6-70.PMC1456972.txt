Abstract
Background: Mycobacterium haemophilum is a slow-growing, fastidious, iron-requiring
microorganism that, relative to other non-tuberculous mycobacterial species, has rarely been
documented as a cause of human infection. This microorganism appears to be acquired via
environmental exposure although its natural habitat and mode of acquisition are unknown. It has
primarily been implicated as a cause of ulcerating cutaneous or subcutaneous nodular skin lesions,
particularly in immunocompromised patients, although infections at extracutaneous sites have also
been described. Osteomyelitis, while rarely documented, appears to be an important complication
of infection with M. haemophilum in these patients.
Case presentation: We describe a unique case of culture-confirmed M. haemophilum
osteomyelitis in an adult woman with polycythemia vera and review the world literature on bone
infections due to this organism.
Conclusion: Mycobacterium haemophilum is an important but infrequently encountered cause of
osteomyelitis in immunocompromised patients, often requiring months to years of medical
therapy, with or without surgery, to effect a clinical cure.
Background
Mycobacterium haemophilum is a slow-growing, fastidious,
iron-requiring microorganism that, relative to other non-
tuberculous mycobacterial species, has rarely been docu-
mented as a cause of human infection. This microorgan-
ism appears to be acquired from environmental exposure
although its natural habitat and mode of acquisition are
unknown. It has primarily been implicated as a cause of
ulcerating cutaneous or subcutaneous nodular skin
lesions, particularly in immunocompromised patients,
although infections at extracutaneous sites have also been
described. Like other nontuberculous mycobacteria, M.
haemophilum can cause chronic cervicofacial lymphadeni-
tis, particularly in immunocompetent children [1-3].
Osteomyelitis, while rarely documented, appears to be an
important complication of infection with M. haemophilum
in these patients. We report a case of M. haemophilum
osteomyelitis in a patient with polycythemia vera and
provide a summary review of the world literature on M.
haemophilum bone infections.
Case presentation
A 56-year-old businesswoman with a 16-year history of
polycythemia vera, apparently well controlled with busul-
fan, presented for medical attention with a 1-month his-
tory of painful ulcerating nodular skin lesions on her right
wrist and right ankle. The lesions were biopsied, with
Ziehl-Neelsen stains demonstrating the presence of acid-

fast bacilli (AFB). She had lived in Canada for most of her
adult life aside from yearly, extended vacations in Ari-
zona, USA. She was not aware of any contact with tuber-
culous individuals, and had no history of exposure to fish
tanks. She recalled experiencing minor trauma to her right
wrist just prior to the emergence of the nodular lesions. A
Mantoux test was not performed. Physical examination
revealed tender nodular and erythematous ankle and
wrist lesions (3 cm and 1 cm in diameter, respectively),
with full thickness skin ulceration. Chest X-ray was nor-
mal. While awaiting culture results, she was started on
clarithromycin 500 mg orally twice daily, ciprofloxacin
500 mg orally twice daily, and rifabutin 300 mg orally
once daily, after which her wrist lesion slowly healed. The
ankle lesion did not respond significantly to medical ther-
apy. X-rays demonstrated osteolysis of the distal tibia con-
sistent with osteomyelitis. She developed gastrointestinal
intolerance to ciprofloxacin and rifabutin, and was con-
tinued on clarithromycin alone. At this time, her poly-
cythemia treatment was subsequently switched from
busulfan to hydroxyurea. The wrist and ankle bone biopsy
specimens were inoculated onto plain and hemin-supple-
mented Middlebrook 7H10 agar media and BACTEC 12B
blood culture bottles incubated at 30°C in an aerobic
atmosphere (National Mycobacteriology Laboratory,
Edmonton, Canada). After 1 and 6 weeks, respectively,
growth of acid-fast bacilli was observed only on the
hemin-supplemented Middlebrook slants inoculated
with the wrist and ankle specimens and definitively iden-
tified as M. haemophilum by high-performance liquid
chromatography (Laboratoire de sante publique du Que-
bec, Montreal, Canada). Susceptibility testing was per-
formed using Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) on
Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with sheep blood.
The organism was susceptible to clarithromycin (MIC ≤
16 µg/ml) and rifabutin (MIC ≤ 0.12 µg/ml) but resistant
to ciprofloxacin (MIC 4 µg/ml), amikacin (MIC ≥ 8 µg/
ml), and ethambutol (MIC ≥ 8 µg/ml) based on unofficial
breakpoints proposed by the National Mycobacteriology
Laboratory, Edmonton, Canada. Re-biopsy of the ankle
lesion demonstrated the presence of AFB but no evidence
of superinfection with other pathogens. An HIV test was
ordered at this time but was negative. An MRI scan 6
months later demonstrated a significant soft tissue
inflammatory mass underlying the ulcer with extension
through the cortex of the tibia and into the marrow cavity.
After debridement, the ulcer began to granulate and heal
over. After one year of follow-up, our patient's ankle
lesion had completely epithelialized, aside from the
development of a small intermittently draining sinus.
Repeat MRI another 6 months later demonstrated resolu-
tion of the original soft tissue inflammatory mass but
without evidence of bony healing. She improved after 2
years of clarithromycin therapy, with plans to continue
therapy indefinitely until there was radiologic evidence of
bony healing, although she eventually died of transforma-
tion to acute leukemia.
Discussion
Mycobacterium haemophilum is a slow-growing, fastidious,
nontuberculous mycobacterial species that was first iso-
lated and described by Sompolinsky in 1978, who recov-
ered the organism from chronic ulcerating subcutaneous
lesions in a woman with Hodgkin's disease [4]. Since
then, approximately 100 cases of infection have been
described worldwide, with the majority of affected indi-
viduals being immunocompromised by virtue of organ or
bone marrow transplantation, haematological malig-
nancy, or advanced HIV infection/AIDS [2,5-12]. In such
individuals, the classical clinical presentation has been
that of multiple tender ulcerating cutaneous or subcutane-
ous nodular skin lesions, commonly on the extremities
and often overlying joints [2,5-12]. Occasionally, lesions
have been associated with cellulitis or complicated by
abscess formation, fistula development, osteomyelitis,
septic arthritis, or bacteremia [2,5-7,9-11]. Cases of pneu-
monia, pulmonary nodules, or sinusitis without skin
lesions have also been described in both immunocom-
promised and immunocompetent individuals [2,3,5-7,9-
12]. Several cases of localized lymphadenitis, particularly
of the cervical, submandibular, and perihilar regions,
have been reported in immunocompetent patients, espe-
cially children [1-3].
The natural habitat and mode of acquisition of M. haemo-
philum are unknown. However, the geographic distribu-
tion of M. haemophilum is thought to be ubiquitous [2,9].
Evidence from reported cases points to an environmental
reservoir, possibly aquatic, although attempts to recover
the organism through environmental sampling have been
unsuccessful [2,13]. A few patients have reported anteced-
ent trauma at the site of infection [11,13]. Although the
pathophysiology of M. haemophilum infection is not well
understood, cell-mediated immunity appears to play a
key role in disease pathogenesis and outcome [10,11].
In common with most other nontuberculous mycobacte-
rial infections, disease is usually chronic [2]. The organ-
ism is difficult to cultivate in the laboratory, and is unique
among the mycobacteria in its requirement for iron-con-
taining compounds in growth media [2]. Furthermore, M.
haemophilum requires low incubation temperatures (30–
32°C) for growth [2]. Hence, cases of infection due to M.
haemophilum are likely under-reported. However,
advances in molecular biology have greatly facilitated our
understanding of the clinical spectrum of infection caused
by this microorganism and have paved the way for sensi-
tive and specific detection of M. haemophilum directly
from clinical specimens or for definitive characterization
of suspect clinical isolates using tools such as PCR, real-

time PCR, or 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing

Mycobacterium haemophilum appears to be the most impor-
tant cause of non-tuberculous mycobacterial osteomyeli-
tis infections in humans [6,16-26]. Over 30 cases of M.
haemophilum bone infections have been described to date,
with most occurring in patients with advanced HIV dis-
ease or bone marrow/solid organ transplants (Table 1)
[2,5-7,9-12,17-28]. Infections may involve multiple sites,
are frequently associated with septic arthritis and/or over-
lying cutaneous infection, and usually involve the bones
of the foot, ankle, knee, elbow, and fingers [2,5-7,9-12,17-
28]. These and other sites may be involved via contiguous
spread or hematogenous dissemination from a pulmo-
nary or cutaneous source. Affected patients may or may
not report a history of antecedent trauma. Infections of
bone typically develop over the course of several weeks.
Plain film radiographs and MRI scans often reveal well-
marginated osteolysis, cortical bone destruction, and
adjacent soft tissue inflammation [21]. In a 3-year review
of atypical mycobacterial skeletal infections in 25 HIV-
infected patients, M. haemophilum accounted for 44% (11/
25) of cases, followed by infection with M. kansasi and M.
avium-intracellulare [6]. A study from January 1989 to Sep-
tember 1991 at seven metropolitan hospitals in New York
City identified 13 patients with culture-confirmed M. hae-
mophilum infections (11 with HIV infection and 2 with
bone marrow transplants), of which 6 had osteomyelitis
[11]. While our case may be the first report of M. haemo-
philum osteomyelitis in a patient with polycythemia vera,
our patient's predisposition to infection was likely a result
of myelosuppression from long-term busulfan/hydroxyu-
rea therapy. A case of fatal disseminated non-M. haemo-
philum atypical mycobacterial infection was reported in a
woman with pulmonary fibrosis secondary to long-term
busulfan use [29].
Most strains of M. haemophilum demonstrate in-vitro sus-
ceptibility to ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, rifamycins,
and clofazimine [2,7,8,12,30]. Isolates are usually resist-
ant to isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, while
susceptibility to doxycycline, minocycline, amikacin, and
para-aminosalcylic acid is variable [2,7,8,12,30]. There is
no consensus on the optimal modality or duration of
treatment of M. haemophilum bone infections. However,
successful treatment of osteomyelitis may require several
months of antimicrobial therapy but should be guided by
the patient's underlying condition and clinical response.
Based on information from previously reported cases,
combinations of drugs, including ciprofloxacin, clarithro-
mycin, and/or rifabutin appear to be associated with the
greatest potential success when used for the treatment of
osteomyelitis or localized skin and soft tissue infection
[2,5-7,10-12,20,31]. Patients should be monitored peri-
odically while on combinations of rifamycins and mac-
rolides due to the potential for drug-drug interactions.
Rifabutin induces hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes,
which may result in increased metabolism of clarithromy-
cin, leading to potentially subtherapeutic concentrations
of the latter drug. However, clarithromycin inhibits the
hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymatic pathway, leading to
potentially toxic concentrations of rifabutin [23,31].
Rifamycins should not be used alone due to the potential
for rapid development of resistance. Patients with local-
ized disease usually respond favorably to medical treat-
ment, although deaths have been reported, especially for
disseminated infection [2,7,8,10,12]. It has been observed
that improvement of immune function during the course
of disease may lead to an improve outcome [9] but this
has not been well documented in osteomyelitis cases. Sur-
gery has occasionally been used, often in combination
with antimicrobial agents, for the treatment of M. haemo-
philum bone infections but the impact of surgery on
patient outcome is unknown.
Conclusion
M. haemophilum is a clinically significant mycobacterial
species with a predilection for causing bone infection in
immunocompromised individuals. In the appropriate
clinical setting, M. haemophilum osteomyelitis should be
considered in the differential diagnosis of immunocom-
promised patient presenting with nodular or ulcerative
skin lesions in conjunction radiographic evidence of adja-
cent bone destruction, especially if tissue biopsies reveal
the presence of AFB. Successful outcomes usually require
months or even years of medical therapy.
