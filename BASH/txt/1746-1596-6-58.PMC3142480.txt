Abstract
Background: The tumor suppressor gene p53 is involved in the control of cell proliferation, particularly in stressed
cells. p 53 gene mutations are the most frequent genetic event found in human cancers. Fanconi Anemia (FA) is
the most common representative of inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) with a leukemic propensity.
P 53 DNA alteration has not been studied before in Egyptian children with FA.
Patients and methods: we investigated p53 mutation in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of forty children,
FA (n = 10), acquired aplastic anemia (AAA) (n = 10), and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) as a control (n = 20),
using real-time PCR by TaqMan probe assay
Results: Mutation of p53 gene was demonstrated in the BM of 90% (9/10) of children with FA, compared to 10%
(1/10) in AAA (p < 0.001), while, no p53 DNA mutation was seen in the control group. A positive correlation
between DNA breakage and presence of p53 mutation was seen in FA (p < 0.02, r0.81).
Conclusion: mutation of p53 gene in hypoplastic marrow especially FA may represent an early indicator of
significant DNA genetic alteration with cancer propensity.
Introduction
Patients with IBMFS are at increased risk of malignant
transformation, possibly due to cell cycle deregulation as
marked by the over expression of cell cycle markers as
p53 and Ki-67 [1,2]. Fanconi’s anemia (FA), the most
common disorder of IBMFS, is a rare autosomal reces-
sive disorder (prevalence of 1-5 per million) with bone
marrow failure, developmental anomalies, and predispo-
sition to leukemia and solid tumors [3-5].
The p53 gene plays a major role in cell-cycle regula-
tion, particularly in the presence of a genetic alteration
in DNA, a critical step for the initiation of leukemogen-
esis [6].
In healthy humans, the p53 protein is continually pro-
duced and degraded in the cell. However, it becomes
activated in response to multiple types of stresses, which
include DNA damage, oxidative stress, osmotic shock,
ribonucleotide depletion and deregulated oncogene
expression [7]. More than 50% of human tumors con-
tain a mutation or a deletion in the p53 gene. Increasing
the expression of p53 gene, which is a tumour suppres-
sor gene involved in the apoptotsis, and the control of
cell proliferation may be a good way to treat tumors or
prevent them from spreading. Thus, restoring endogen-
ous p53 function as the use of gene therapy holds a lot
of promise in future treatment of malignancies [8-10].
Since p53 is not over expressed in the BM of hemato-
logically normal individuals [11,12]. We hypothesized
that DNA damage and cancer predisposition in BM fail-
ure disorders could be related to p53 gene alterations.
We studied the expression of p53 mutation, as a marker
of cell cycle dysregulation, in BM of children with FA as
well as children with AAA.

stuttered, microcephally, brown skin pigmentation and
twins boys from another family, they had short stut-
tered, microcephally, brown skin pigmentation, one of
them diagnosed AML at date of presentation ) and
other 20 child with ITP (7 males and 13 females) as a
control. The age of children at presentation in the study
ranged from 4 to 14 years. They were visiting the
Hematology Outpatient Clinic, Pediatric Department,
Sohag University Hospital. Family history was recorded
in pre-designed proforms and a detailed pedigree was
taken in each case. Informed consent was taken from
the patients or/and their parents in case of younger. All
patients in the study and the control groups were sub-
jected to clinical examination laboratory investigations
including peripheral hemogram, bone marrow aspiration
(BMA). Trephine bone marrow biopsy (BMB) for cases
with marrow hypoplasia. Mytomycin C (MMC) stress
test and detection of p53 gene mutation were done in
all patients of the study and the control groups.
Methods
All the study populations were subjected to:
-Routine investigations (random blood sugar, renal
function tests and liver function testes on CX-9 Beck-
man - coulter., France ).
- Complete blood count (Cell Dyne - 2700, Abbott
Lab., USA).
- Assessment of BM cellularity:
BMA samples were obtained from all patients of the
study and the control groups by anterior superior iliac
spine approach. The smears were stained by ordinary
stains, examined for the cellular morphology. BMB was
done to all patients with hypoplastic marrow, it per-
formed under general anesthesia, through posterior
superior iliac spine approach by Islamic biopsy needle
No. 8, No. 12. Paraffin’s embedded sections were exam-
ined by H & E stain for detection of marrow architec-
ture and cellularity, reticuline stain was used to detect
marrow fibrosis. BM cellularity was independently and
blindly graded according to Frisch and Lewis [13]: defi-
nite hypercellularity (grade 6); moderate hypercellularity
(grade 5); normal cellularity (grade 4); mild hypocellular-
ity (grade 3); moderate hypocellularity (grade 2) and,
severe hypocellularity (grade 1), Figure 1.
- Mitomycin C (MMC) stress test: induced chromo-
somal breakage study was carried out on peripheral
blood samples or BMA in severe hypoplasia according
to a published method [14]. 3-5 ml of whole blood or/B.
M was delivered into Green-top (sodium heparin) tube
(s). The blood was transferred to a flask containing cell
culture media and a cell mitogen, phytohemagglutinin
(PHA) for lymphocyte stimulation. The cells are incu-
bated at 37°C for 66 to 72 hours. MMC (40 ng/mg) is
added to cultures about 48 hours prior to harvesting the
cells for chromosomes studies. Sets of untreated cultures
were performed for all the study population samples to
serve as a base line, a healthy control samples were
done to evaluate the results. In the harvest process, the
cells are exposed to colcemid and hypotonic solution,
and fixed with glacial acetic acid and methanol. Meta-
phase cells were dropped onto slides; at least 20 meta-
phases (stained with Giemsa) were analyzed from each
culture (MMC-treated, untreated and healthy control).
The MMC-induced chromosomal breakages were then
compared to those in the baseline (untreated) culture in
all patients groups and healthy control samples. Various
chromosome anomalies can be induced with MMC, but
in FA, the most specific anomalies are radial configura-
tions and increase breakage. Total radials in 20 cells and
the percentage of cells with radials are calculated for the
patients groups (hypoplasia, ITP) and the healthy con-
trol. Achromatic areas more than a chromosomal width
were scored as breaks. The breaks and radial figures
were expressed in percent, i.e. number of breaks or
radial figures/number of mitotic figures × 100, Figure 2.
- Diagnosis of hereditary aplastic anemia (FA) was
done in Sohag University Hospital, Pediatric and Clinical
Pathology Department depending on personal and
family history, physical examination, peripheral blood,
bone marrow and MMC test.
- Detection of p53 gene mutation: was performed in
Suiz Canal University Hospital, Clinical Pathology Dept.,
p53 DNA was extracted from BM samples using the
AxyPrep blood genomic DNA Miniprep kit according to
manufacturer’s instructions (AXYGEN Biosciences, CA,
USA). p53 DNA amplification was performed by real-
time PCR using TaqMan probe technique in a total
volume of 100 μl that included: 10 × Buffer (10 μL),
dNTPs Mix 200 nM (2 μL), Forward primer (5’-
CCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTG-3’) 900 nM (10 μL),
Reverse primer (5’-ATGGCCATGGTGCGGAC-3’) 900
nM (10 μL), TaqMan Probe (5’-FAM-CCAACCCC
CGCCCGGCA-TAMRA-3’) 300 nM (10 μL), Hot Start
Taq polymerase 2.5 U (0.5 μL), MgCl2 100 mM (5 μL),
H2O (42.5 μL), and p53 DNA template (10 μL). PCR
amplification was done in Rotor-Gene™ 6000 real-time
rotary analyzer (Corbett Research Pty Ltd, Mortlake,
NSW, Australia) using the following protocol: (95°C for
7 min) for one cycle, followed by a three-step program:
(96°C for 45 Sec), (56°C for 1 min) and, (72°C for 30
Sec) for 40 cycles. And,(30° for 10 sec) for one cycle. (N.
B primers, Taqman probe, and master mix were pro-
vided by Bioron GmbH, Germany).

Values were expressed as mean ± S.D and percentages
as appropriate. t-test was used for peripheral blood vari-
ables.p53 was compared between groups using Fisher
exact test.
Results
Characteristics of the study population are demonstrated
in (table 1):
Regarding the age, FA children are the youngest one
at time of presentaion comparing to AAA and ITP (p <
0.001). Sex distribution is equal in FA (50% for both
sex), in AAA is (40% males, 60% females), and in ITP
the females are predominant (35% males, 65% females).
The peripheral blood and the BM findings are illu-
strated in (table 2, Figure 1), TLC is highly significant
decrease in FA patients and in AAA (p < 0.001). Hb
showed a significant decrease in FA and AAA (p < 0.05),
MCV is highly significant increase in FA (p < 0.001). Pla-
telets count shows severe thrombocytopenia in ITP,
moderate to severe thrombocytopenia in FA and mild
thrombocytopenia in AAA. Increase in megakaryocytes is
present in marrow aspirates from ITP, hypocellular mar-
row is found in both FA and AAA samples. BMB demon-
strates that, the hypoplasia grade 1,2,3 are present in 8
cases with FA (80%), and in 6 cases with AAA(60%).
Marrow fibrosis is present in 3 cases with AAA (30%).
MMC stress test is illustrated in (table 3, Figure 2),
where increase in chromosomal breakage and radial
chromatin formation are found in FA patients, normal
induction time in AAA and ITP comparing to healthy
test control.
P53 gene mutation in the study population (table 4),
p53 gene mutation expression was significantly higher in
FA (80%) compared to AAA (10%) and control group
(0%) (p < 0.001).
DNA breakage and p53: a positive correlation between
DNA breakage and p53 mutation was demonstrated in
FA patients (p < 0.02, r0.81).
Discussion
p53 protein over expression in IBMFS may represent an
early indicator of significant DNA genetic alteration,
which is a crucial step in the process of leukemogenesis.
Thus, up regulation p53 mutation gene in our FA
patients may reflect a state of reaction to cell stress
mostly related to DNA damage as previously reported
[6]. This activation was explained previously by a drastic
increase in the half-life of the p53 protein, leading to a
quick accumulation of p53 in stressed cells [15].
P53 mutation was not expressed in most AAA
patients (90%) and all control group patients (ITP)
(100%) as previously described [12]. To ensure that cells
under non-stressed conditions (as in AAA and control
group) are able to grow, p53 sets up a negative feedback
loop by inducing a protein called Mdm2 [16]. Mdm2 is
able to both inhibit the transcriptional regulation by p53
[17] and, degrade it thus, maintaining p53 inactive until
it is required [18-20].
Expression p 53mutation was significantly up regu-
lated in the marrow samples of FA patients (80%). This
probably reflected a functional up-regulation of p53
gene to provide additional protection for cells with
damaged and potentially hazardous DNA. Apart from

two FA patients who showed no expression of p53
mutation in the BM, a good concordance between p53
mutation gene expression and FA was observed. Of note
is that these two patients had moderate DNA breakage
points and normal BM cellularity. Despite the small
number of patients, which, is a limitation of this study,
we conclude that FA in Egyptian children is associated
with an up regulation of p53 gene mutation which
could explain the tendency of those patients to develop
malignancies, on the other hand the AAA, only one case
(10%) showed the expression of the mutant p53, this
case has a severe hypoplastic marrow which postulate
the possible oncogenic cause in AAA. However, future
studies on larger population are warranted [21].
