Abstract
Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) leads to a prolonged state of
immunodeficiency and requires reconstitution of normal T-cell immunity. Signal joint T-cell receptor excision DNA
circles (sjTRECs) are markers of developmental proximity to the thymus that have been used to evaluate thymic
function related to T-cell immune reconstitution after HSCT. To assess the proliferative history in different T-cell
receptor beta variable region (TRBV) subfamilies of T cells after HSCT, expansion of TRBV subfamily-naive T cells was
determined by analysis of a series of TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs.
Methods: sjTRECs levels were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 43 Chinese acute leukemia patients who underwent allo-HSCT. Twenty-
three TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs were amplified by semi-nested PCR. Sixteen age-matched healthy volunteers served as
normal controls.
Results: sjTRECs levels were low or undetectable in the first 6 weeks after allo-HSCT and increased after 8 weeks
post HSCT; however, sjTRECs levels at week 20 post-HSCT were still less than normal controls. Frequencies of TRBV
subfamily sjTRECs in PBMCs from recipients at week 8 post-HSCT (29.17 ± 20.97%) or at week 16 post-HSCT (38.33
± 9.03%) were significantly lower than those in donors (47.92 ± 13.82%) or recipients at pre-HSCT (45.83 ± 14.03%).
However, frequencies of TRBV subfamily sjTRECs in recipients at week 30 post-HSCT (42.71 ± 21.62%) were similar
to those in donors and recipients at pre-HSCT. sjTRECs levels in donors had a positive linear correlation with
sjTRECs levels in recipients within 8-12 weeks post-HSCT. Patients with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or
chronic GVHD had profoundly reduced TRECs levels during the first year post-HSCT. Frequencies of BV22-BD1
sjTRECs and BV23-BD1 sjTRECs in patients with GVHD were significantly lower than those in recipients at pre-HSCT,
and the frequencies of BV22-BD1 sjTRECs in patients with GVHD were significantly lower than those in donors.
Conclusions: Reconstitution of thymic output function resulted in a period of immunodeficiency, with low or
undetectable TRECs after transplantation, although fludarabine-based dose-reduced conditioning regimens were
used. GVHD could affect reconstitution of thymic output function and reduce sjTRECs levels and frequencies of
TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs. Low frequency of BV22-BD1 and BV23-BD1 sjTRECs might be associated with GVHD.

Background
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-
HSCT) provides a potentially curing treatment for
refractory hematopoietic malignancies and is often the
only available treatment for acute leukemia. The trans-
plantation procedure/conditioning regimen generally
leads to a prolonged state of immunodeficiency, charac-
terized by persistent low levels of naïve T cells. Success-
ful allo-HSCT requires reconstitution of normal T-cell
immunity. The T-cell population can be regenerated
through two different pathways [1]. The thymic-inde-
pendent pathway involves expansion of graft-derived
mature donor T cells, whereas the thymic-dependent
pathway involves regeneration of T cells with a more
diverse T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire from graft-
derived precursor cells. Because thymic function is
necessary for de novo generation of T cells after trans-
plantation, quantification of T-cell receptor excision
DNA circles (TRECs) in peripheral blood T cells can be
used to determine the potential function of T lympho-
poiesis after HSCT [2]. Signal joint T-cell receptor exci-
sion DNA circles (sjTRECs) are the products of
rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gene, leading to
the excision of circular DNA fragments from genomic
DNA during thymocyte development. Quantification of
sjTRECs in peripheral blood, as a measure of thymic
function, overcomes the disadvantages associated with
the use of T-cell surface molecules, such as CD45RA, as
markers for recent thymic emigrants (RTEs). Thus,
sjTRECs are markers of developmental proximity to the
thymus and their concentrations in peripheral blood can
be used to estimate thymic output and evaluate thymic
function in patients after stem cell transplantation.
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major compli-
cation following allo-HSCT [3-5]. Poor reconstitution of
T-cell immunity (including reconstitution of recent thy-
mic output function) has been associated with GVHD.
GVHD may predict low TRECs levels and slow naïve T-
cell recovery [6,7]. However, most previously published
studies have focused only on the total number of RTEs,
as measured by quantitative analysis of total sjTRECs.
This approach does not consider the complexity of thy-
mic output and T-cell proliferation in different TRBV
subfamilies, which is an important factor in immune
competence. To assess the proliferative history in differ-
ent TRBV subfamilies of T cells, expansion of particular
TRBV subfamily T cells has been recently determined
by quantitative analysis of a series of TRBV-BD1
sjTRECs [8-11]. However, T-cell proliferation in differ-
ent TRBV subfamilies after allo-HSCT remains poorly
understood.
The main objective of the present study was to inves-
tigate reconstitution of recent thymic output function
after allo-HSCT through analysis of total sjTRECs and
TRBV subfamily sjTRECs. Analysis of TRBV subfamily
sjTRECs frequencies may be beneficial for evaluating T-
cell reconstitution in acute leukemia patients after allo-
HSCT and may further support and explain reconstitu-
tion of RTEs measured by quantitative detection of total
sjTRECs.
Materials and methods
Patients
Forty-three acute leukemia patients (median age, 30.6 ±
10.2 years; range, 17-52 years; classified according to the
French-American-British (FAB) criteria as 27 cases of
acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 16 cases of acute
myeloid leukemia (AML)) underwent allo-HSCT. All
patients had received fludarabine-based, dose-reduced
conditioning regimens (including low-dose fludarabine
30 mg/m2
·d × 3-5 d; total dose 90-150 mg/m2
) and
were full donor chimeras in remission. Transplanted
cells were obtained from the bone marrow or peripheral
blood of an HLA genotypically identical sibling (median
age, 32.1 ± 8.2 years; range, 20-49 years). No specific
procedure was performed to enrich or deplete a specific
cell population. Acute GVHD (aGVHD) and chronic
GVHD (cGVHD) were diagnosed and graded as
described previously [12]. Peripheral blood was obtained
from 16 age-matched healthy volunteers (median age,
30.8 ± 7.6 years; range, 17-48 years). Patient blood sam-
ples were collected at pre-HSCT and every 2 weeks
after allo-HSCT and at GVHD onset, and subsequently
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were sepa-
rated from freshly drawn anticoagulated blood using
Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. All pro-
cedures were conducted in accordance with the guide-
lines of the Medical Ethics Committees of the health
bureau of Guangdong Province, China. Samples were
collected with informed consent.
Flow cytometry
The following fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) - or
phycoerythrin (PE) - labeled monoclonal antibodies
were used: mouse anti-human CD4, CD8, CD45RA, and
CD45RO (BD BioSciences, USA). Stainings were per-
formed by incubating cells with the appropriate pool of
antibodies for 30 min at 4°C followed by a series of
washes with phosphate-buffered saline solution supple-
mented with 2% fetal calf serum. Isotype-matched
FITC-labeled mouse IgG served as the negative control.
DNA extraction
Total DNA from distinct cell populations was extracted
using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Ger-
many). The quality of DNA was analyzed in 1% agarose
gels stained with ethidium bromide, and the concentra-
tion was determined by spectrophotometric analysis at

260 and 280 nm (Lambda 45 UV/VIS Spectrometer;
Perkin Elmer, USA).
Quantification of sjTRECs by real-time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)
The sjTRECs levels were detected by quantitative real-
time PCR. DNA extraction of PBMCs was performed
using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Ger-
many). To precisely determine the percentage of cells
carrying sjTRECs, we used a duplex vector that included
a fragment of the δRec-ψJa sjTREC and a fragment of
the RAG2 gene, constructed by Prof. C.A. Schmidt
[13,14]. RAG2 was first cloned in the T-A acceptor site,
and subsequently the TREC was cloned into the EcoR V
restriction site of the TOPO TA vector. Based on the
DNA concentration, standard dilutions of the vector
from 107
to 101
copies were prepared. Briefly, 50-μL
PCR reactions were performed with approximately 100
ng of genomic DNA, 25 pmol of each primer, 10 nmol
of each dNTP, 1.25 U of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase, 5
pmol of 6-FAM-TAMRA probe, and PCR buffer with
4.5 mM MgCl2. After an initial denaturation at 95°C for
5 min, 45 cycles consisting of 95°C for 30 s and 67°C
for 1 min were performed. The amplification was per-
formed on MJ Research DNA Engine Opticon 2 PCR
cycler (BIO-RAD, USA).
Semi-nested PCR
Twenty-three TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs were amplified by
semi-nested PCR using 0.325 μg of genomic DNA, cor-
responding to 5 × 104
PBMCs. Two nested 5’-TRBD1
primers, located upstream of the segment, and 23 BV
primers (BV1-19 and BV21-24; rearrangement of BV20
does not generate a sjTREC because of its reverse orien-
tation) were used [14]. In the first-round PCR, aliquots
of the DNA (2 μl) were amplified in 10-μl reactions
with one of the 23 BV primers (antisense) and a BD1
primer (sense primer); the final reaction mixture con-
tained 0.375 μM of sense and antisense primers, 0.1
mM of dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 × PCR buffer, and 1
U of Taq polymerase (Promega, USA). Amplification
was performed as described previously [14].
Statistical analyses
The correlation of sjTRECs levels between pre-HSCT
and post-HSCT and that of sjTRECs levels between
donors and recipients after allo-HSCT were analyzed
using the Pearson correlation test. The Mann-Whitney
U-test was used to compare the difference in levels or
frequencies of sjTRECs or TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs. The
Fisher exact test was used to compare the frequency of
TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs in PBMCs between patients at
GVHD onset and patients at pre-HSCT or donors. Data
were analyzed using the SPSS software (ver. 13.0) and
differences were considered statistically significant when
the P-value was less than 0.05.
Results
RTEs of healthy controls, donors, and recipients
In the present study, donors and normal controls were
of similar age to the recipients, with ages ranging mostly
from 20 to 35 years. We found no significant correlation
between sjTRECs levels and age in the healthy controls,
donor group, or recipient group at pre-HSCT (r =
-0.001, -0.110, -0.232, respectively; P = 0.998, 0.664,
0.286, respectively) and no significant age-associated
correlation of the numbers of the TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs
subfamily in the healthy controls, donor group, or reci-
pient group (r = -0.591, 0.455, 0.543, respectively; P =
0.072, 0.441, 0.457, respectively). No significant correla-
tion was found between the sjTRECs levels after allo-
HSCT and age of the recipients (r = -0.197; P = 0.107),
or between the numbers of the TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs
subfamily after allo-HSCT and age of recipients (r =
0.422; P = 0.071).
The sjTRECs levels in PBMCs from healthy controls
(3.011 ± 0.838 copies per 1000 PBMCs) were higher
than those in the donor group (1.299 ± 1.573 copies per
1000 PBMCs) and in the recipients group at pre-HSCT
(1.367 ± 2.102 copies per 1000 PBMCs) (P = 0.000,
0.000, respectively). No statistical correlation was found
between sjTRECs levels in recipients at pre-HSCT and
those within 12 weeks post-HSCT (including the ~4
weeks post-HSCT group, 4-8 weeks post-HSCT group,
and 8-12 weeks post-HSCT group) (r = -0.197, 0.527,
-0.214, respectively; P = 0.562, 0.145, 0.527, respectively).
No statistical correlation was also found between
sjTRECs levels in donors and the sjTRECs levels within
8 weeks post-HSCT (including the ~4 weeks post-HSCT
group and the 4-8 weeks post-HSCT group) (r = -0.153,
-0.160; P = 0.771, 0.638). However, the sjTRECs levels
in donors showed a positive linear correlation with the
sjTRECs levels in recipients within 8-12 weeks post-
HSCT (r = 0.869; P = 0.011).

T cells remained at low levels within 8
weeks after HSCT, and higher after week 12 post-HSCT
(P = 0.003). Within 8 weeks post-HSCT, the CD45RO+
T cells that expanded were predominant, but after week

T cells predominated
over CD45RO+
T cells in PBMCs (P = 0.000).
The sjTRECs levels were low or undetectable in the
first 6 weeks after allo-HSCT (Figure 2). The mean
sjTRECs levels were lowered from 0.971 ± 1.462 copies
per 1000 PBMCs at week 2 to 0.918 ± 1.055 copies per
1000 PBMCs at week 4, and near baseline at week 6
(0.107 ± 0.108 copies per 1000 PBMCs) after transplan-
tation. The sjTRECs levels increased after week 8 post-
HSCT. The sjTRECs levels at week 20 after allo-HSCT
(1.247 ± 1.100 copies per 1000 PBMCs) were similar to
the sjTRECs levels at pre-HSCT (1.119 ± 1.549 copies
per 1000 PBMCs; P = 0.870); however, they were still
lower than the normal controls (3.011 ± 0.838 copies
per 1000 PBMCs; P = 0.001). Additionally, four recipi-
ents (three cases of AML and one case of ALL) had an
early relapse after allo-HSCT, and their sjTRECs levels
in PBMCs returned to the baseline or were undetectable
(their sjTRECs levels before allo-HSCT were 1.028,
4.035, 3.122, and 0.027 copies per 1000 PBMCs,
respectively).
Samples were amplified to estimate the frequency of
TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs and sequences of the junction
regions of each TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs were confirmed by
direct sequencing of PCR products (data not shown).
Comparison of the frequencies of TRBV subfamily
sjTRECs at the 5 × 104
PBMC level among donors, reci-
pients at pre-HSCT, and recipients within 30 weeks
post-HSCT (including the week 4 post-HSCT, week 8
post-HSCT, week 16 post-HSCT, and week 30 post-
HSCT groups) revealed that the frequencies of TRBV
subfamily sjTRECs in recipients at week 8 post-HSCT
(29.17 ± 20.97%) or at week 16 post-HSCT (38.33 ±
9.03%) were significantly lower than in donors (47.92 ±
13.82%) or recipients at pre-HSCT (45.83 ± 14.03%; P <
0.05). The frequency of TRBV subfamily sjTRECs in
recipients at week 30 post-HSCT (42.71 ± 21.62%) was
similar to that in donors or recipients at pre-HSCT (Fig-
ure 3). Low frequencies of particular TRBV subfamily
sjTRECs were found in recipients at pre-HSCT (BV2-
BD1, BV3-BD1, BV7-BD1, BV8-BD1, BV9-BD1, BV12-
BD1, and BV17-BD1 sjTRECs), in the week 4 post-
HSCT group (BV7-BD1, BV9-BD1, BV12-BD1, BV17-
BD1, and BV18-BD1 sjTRECs), in the week 8 post-
HSCT group (BV2-BD1, BV3-BD1, BV7-BD1, BV9-BD1,
BV12-BD1, BV17-BD1, BV22-BD1, and BV23-BD1
sjTRECs), in the week 16 post-HSCT group (BV1-BD1,
BV3-BD1, BV5-BD1, BV7-BD1, BV9-BD1, BV12-BD1,
and BV22-BD1 sjTRECs), and in the week 30 post-
HSCT group (BV23-BD1 sjTRECs).
Figure 2 Changes of sjTRECs levels in the early period after allo-HSCT. The sjTRECs levels of recipients at pre-HSCT were lower than the
sjTRECs levels of the normal controls. The sjTRECs levels were near the baseline at week 6 post-HSCT and increased after 8 weeks post-HSCT. But
the sjTRECs levels at week 20 after HSCT were still lower than the normal controls. Error bars represent the SEM. The squares represent the mean

Changes in the recent thymic output function with GVHD
The sjTRECs levels were measured in patients who had
no episodes of GVHD and patients at acute or chronic
GVHD onset. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the differ-
ence in sjTRECs levels between recipients with GVHD
and recipients without GVHD within 2 years post-
HSCT was statistically significant. The sjTRECs levels in
patients with aGVHD or cGVHD were low or undetect-
able during the first year post-HSCT. With clinical
immune treatment, sjTRECs levels in some cGVHD
patients had increased after 2 years post-HSCT. Addi-
tionally, we found that one patient with immune treat-
ment for cGVHD experienced a rise in sjTRECs levels
(1.325 copies/1000 PBMCs) after 4 years post-HSCT.
Comparison of the frequencies of 23 TRBV-BD1
sjTRECs among patients with GVHD, donors, and reci-
pients at pre-HSCT showed that the frequencies of
BV22-BD1 sjTRECs and BV23-BD1 sjTRECs in patients
with GVHD were significantly lower than those in reci-
pients at pre-HSCT (P = 0.039, 0.012), and the frequen-
cies of BV22-BD1 sjTRECs in patients with GVHD were
significantly lower than those in donors (P = 0.003).
However, no significant difference was found in the fre-
quencies of other TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs among groups of
patients with GVHD and donors and recipients at pre-
HSCT (P > 0.05; Figure 4).
Discussion
During TCR rearrangement processes in the thymus, by-
products in the form of sjTRECs are considered to be a
valuable tool to estimate thymic function [14]. Quantita-
tive analysis of δRec-ψJa sjTRECs provides information
about total thymic output and TRBV-BD sjTRECs speci-
fic for each TRBV subfamily allow determination of the
proliferative history of a particular TRBV subfamily
[8-11]. In the present study, we detected both δRec-ψJa
sjTRECs and TRBV-BD sjTRECs to evaluate not only
the recent total naïve T-cell output but also the specific
TRBV subfamily naïve T-cell output from the thymus in
patients after HSCT.
The sjTRECs levels in recipients before allo-HSCT
were lower than those in healthy controls, suggesting
that recipients still had a low thymus output function
before allo-HSCT. Also, sjTRECs levels in donors were
lower than those in healthy controls. The cause may be
that the blood samples of donors were collected after
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobiliza-
tion, and G-CSF can influence T-cell immunity. Pre-
vious studies have indicated that age was a crucial factor
determining the contribution of thymic output to T-cell
recovery post-HSCT[6,7,15-18]. Patient age might be the
single most important factor determining the success of
immune reconstitution post-HSCT and whether thymic-
dependent or -independent pathways contribute to T-
cell reconstitution post-HSCT. Thymic function and
sjTRECs levels normally decrease with age. However, in
the present study, we did not observe such a correlation
between sjTRECs levels and age or between the num-
bers of TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs and age in healthy controls,
the donor group, or the recipient group. Additionally,
no statistical correlation was noted between the sjTRECs
levels after allo-HSCT and age of recipients. The cause
may be that the chosen ages of normal individuals,
donors, and recipients mainly ranged from 20 to 35
years old, and for that narrow range of age, the

immunological index of thymic function, such as
sjTRECs levels or the numbers of TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs,
demonstrates no significant age-associated correlation.
The early post-transplant period is characterized by
profound immunodeficiency and recovery of a self-
restricted, diverse T-cell repertoire is dependent on thy-
mic production of T cells from hematopoietic progeni-
tors. The appearance of sjTRECs after transplantation
was associated with the emergence of phenotypically
naïve T cells. Bahceci et al. measured the highest TRECs
counts 2 weeks after non-myeloablative HSCT and
observed a gradual decrease in TRECs numbers up to 6
months after HSCT, indicating that T-cell reconstitution
was due rather to post-thymic T-cell expansion than to
thymopoiesis [19]. However, Przybylski et al. [20]
observed an increase in TRECs counts after an initial
drop to undetectable levels, starting 2-3 months after
HSCT and reaching a plateau 6 months after HSCT,
indicating ongoing thymic output. Although fludara-
bine-based, non-myeloablative conditioning was per-
formed in both studies, the regimen used in the Bahceci
study (125 mg/m2
fludarabine) was milder than that in
the Przybylski study (180 mg/m2
fludarabine). The dif-
ferences in TRECs counts after HSCT might be due to
different pre-transplantation conditioning. In the present
study, we found that most recipients experienced a per-
iod of immunodeficiency with low or almost undetect-
able TRECs numbers at the early stage after
transplantation, although all patients had received dose-
reduced conditioning regimens (including low-dose flu-
darabine (90-150 mg/m2
)). The sjTRECs levels were
lowered, from 0.971 ± 1.462 copies per 1000 PBMCs at
week 2 to 0.918 ± 1.055 copies per 1000 PBMCs at
week 4, near baseline at week 6 after transplant, and
increased after week 8. The sjTRECs levels at week 20
after allo-HSCT were elevated and similar to sjTRECs
levels at pre-HSCT, but were still lower than the normal
controls. We also found that CD45RA+
T cells predomi-
nated over CD45RO+
T cells in PBMCs after week 8
post-HSCT. These results confirmed that sjTRECs levels
in PBMCs were restored in the short-term post-HSCT
(within 12 weeks) via peripheral expansion of graft-
derived mature T cells, and subsequently thymic-depen-
dent T-cell recovery from graft-derived precursor cells
predominated. Additionally, we found that sjTRECs
levels in donors demonstrated a positive linear correla-
tion with sjTRECs levels in recipients within 8-12 weeks
post-HSCT. This corresponds to CD45RO+
T-cell
expansion, which predominated within 8 weeks post-
HSCT. It also suggests that higher sjTRECs levels in
donors should be beneficial to transplant recipients to
rapidly reconstitute a functional immune system.
Most published studies of T-cell reconstitution have
relied on post-transplantation measurement of TRECs
and TRBV repertoire diversity [21]. Previous studies
have focused only on the total number of RTEs, as mea-
sured by quantitative analysis of total sjTRECs. This
approach does not examine the role of different TRBV
subfamilies in T-cell proliferation and the complexity of
thymic output. Additionally, analyzing the changes of
the TRBV repertoire cannot indicate the source of the
specific T-cell clones that came from the expansion of
graft-derived mature donor T cells or the regeneration
of T cells after thymic output from graft-derived precur-
sor cells. To assess the proliferative history in different
TRBV subfamilies of T cells, as in our previous study,
we analyzed 23 subfamilies of TRBV-DB1 sjTRECs in
AML patients and observed a significantly lower fre-
quency of TRBV-DB1 sjTRECs [10]. In the present
study, we observed that frequencies of TRBV subfamily
sjTRECs in recipients at week 8 post-HSCT or at week
16 post-HSCT were significantly lower than those in
donors or recipients at pre-HSCT. The frequencies of
TRBV subfamily sjTRECs in recipients at week 30 post-
HSCT were similar to those in donors or recipients at
pre-HSCT, except that the TRBV23-BD1 subfamily
sjTRECs remained at a low frequency. The results
further support and explain the reconstitution of RTEs

numbers in peripheral blood of acute leukemia patients
after HSCT, as measured by quantitative detection of
total sjTRECs.
GVHD has been demonstrated to have an adverse
effect on thymic output, using sjTRECs to measure thy-
mic output [22]. Przybylski et al. [20] found that recov-
ery of TRECs after non-myeloablative allo-HSCT was
not correlated with the onset of GVHD. Similarly, no
effect of GVHD on TRECs was found in patients after
non-myeloablative HSCT in Bahceci’s research [19]. In
the present study, sjTRECs levels were measured in
patients who had no episode of GVHD or in patients at
acute or chronic GVHD onset. The sjTRECs levels in
patients with GVHD were low or undetectable for the
first 6 months post-HSCT. Patients with acute GVHD
or chronic GVHD had profoundly reduced sjTRECs
levels during the first year post-HSCT. However, with
clinical immune treatment, sjTRECs levels in some
cGVHD patients could increase after 2 years post-
HSCT. Notably, frequencies of BV22-BD1 and BV23-
BD1 sjTRECs in patients with GVHD were significantly
lower than those in recipients at pre-HSCT, and fre-
quencies of BV22-BD1 sjTRECs in patients with GVHD
were significantly lower than those in donors. These
results indicated that GVHD could affect reconstitution
of thymic output function and reduce sjTRECs levels
and frequencies of TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs subfamilies, par-
ticularly BV22-BD1 and BV23-BD1 sjTRECs.
Previous studies had shown that the persistence of low
sjTRECs numbers was associated with a higher inci-
dence of GVHD [2,23], infection [6], and leukemic
relapse [7]. Our study revealed that four recipients had
early relapse after allo-HSCT and their sjTRECs levels
in PBMCs returned to baseline or were undetectable,
suggesting that sjTRECs could be a potentially relevant
prognostic factor for acute leukemia patients who
receive allo-HSCT.
In conclusion, analysis of the frequency of TRBV sub-
family sjTRECs further support and coincide with quanti-
tative detection of total sjTRECs, and whether low
frequency of BV22-BD1 and BV23-BD1 sjTRECs subfa-
milies after HSCT might be associated with GVHD
remains to be determined. Measuring and analyzing total
sjTRECs levels and TRBV subfamily sjTRECs frequencies
during immune reconstitution after HSCT would be use-
ful to determine the status of thymic output function and
ability of T-cell immune reconstitution more precisely,
and may be beneficial in evaluating T-cell reconstitution
in acute leukemia patients after allo-HSCT.
