Abstract
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine whether α-galactosylceramide
(α-GalCer), a synthetic glycolipid agonist of natural killer T (NKT) cells, can ameliorate ex-
ercise-induced immune imbalance. Methods: Eight-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats
were trained with a progressively increasing load for 9 weeks. At 36 h and at 7 d after
training, groups of rats were euthanized. The whole blood was used to detect hemoglo-
bin(Hb), plasma was analyzed for hormones testosterone(T) and corticosterone(C), and
spleen was harvested for detecting NKT cells and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin (IL)-4
producing cells. Results: Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant differ-
ences between training and time in Series 1. The results showed, at 36h after training, that
the decrease in Hb, T and C concentration reflected overtraining or excessive exercise. At 7
d after training, NKT cell populations decreased, and a T helper 1/T helper 2 (Th1/Th2)
lymphocyte imbalance occurred. In Series 2, α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), an NKT cell
activator was found to enhance NKT cell numbers by 69% and shift the Th1/Th2 lymphocyte
imbalance by observably decreasing the frequency of IL-4 secreting cells. Conclusion: These
data showed that, in addition to Th1/Th2 self-regulation, α-GalCer played an important
modulatory role in the exercise-induced Th1/Th2 lymphocyte imbalance, which may be
correlative with NKT immunoregulatory cells.

Introduction
At present, the exercise immunology field is be-
coming increasingly interested in the relationship
between T helper (Th) lymphocytes and immuno-
suppression during overtraining, excessive exercise,
or fatigue[1]. Th lymphocytes represent two distinct
functional subsets: Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes. Th1
lymphocytes are associated with cell-mediated im-
munity (CMI) and the killing of intracellular patho-
gens, while Th2 lymphocytes are associated with
humoral immunity and antibody production. Accu-
mulating evidence suggests that overtrained athletes
exhibit an immune polarization toward the Th2 phe-
notype[1, 2], and it is known that Th1 and Th2 are
regulated reciprocally[1]. Therefore, a shift in favor of
Th2 may suppress CMI and render athlete’s suscepti-
ble to viral infection. Thus, shifting this cytokine bal-
ance away from Th2 and back towards a Th1 profile
might help to reconcile the exercise-induced immune
imbalance.
CD1d-restricted NKT cells expressing both in-
variant T-cell receptors (TCRs)and NK cell receptors
are an important immunoregulatory cell subset active
during the immune differentiation towards Th1 or
Th2[3]. We have recently found that defective NKT

cell function is related to the emergence of exer-
cise-induced immunosuppression [4, 5]. Previous
studies have reported that activated natural killer T
cells (NKT cells) regulate immune responses such as
tumor rejection and autoimmunity by producing
IFN-γ and IL-4[6, 7]. But an important unresolved
issue concerning NKT cells is that they may be able to
display flexibility in their cytokine response. No data
are available on the potential for specific NKT cell
ligands to modulate the exercise-induced imbalance
between Th1 and Th2 cells. IFN-γ and IL-4 are re-
spectively typical Th1 and Th2 related cytokines. Most
of researchers now agree that these two cytokines can
evaluate Th1/Th2 differentiation. Since up-regulation
of Th2 lymphocytes is believed to be decisive for ex-
ercised-induced immune suppression conditions [1],
we hypothesize that whether NKT activation can shift
this cytokine balance away from Th2 (a typital cyto-
kine:IL-4) and back towards a Th1 (a typital cytokine:
IFN-γ) profile by the pattern of secreted cytokines.The
present work was undertaken to explore this possibil-
ity in an animal model of exercise-induced immuno-
suppression induced by overtraining or excessive
exercise. We investigated the effects of
α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), a synthetic glycol-
ipid activator of NKT cells [8], the Th1/Th2 lympho-
cyte balance during overtraining or excessive exercise.
Materials and methods
Animals and exercise protocols
Series 1
Female Sprague-Dawley rats, body mass 228 ±
1.4 g, aged two months were supplied by the Second
Military Medical University (Shanghai, China), All the
animals received humane care in compliance with the
university’s guidelines. All rats were housed (2 per
cage) in 48 cm×25 cm polypropylene cages that con-
tained sawdust bedding. A standard 12-h light-dark
cycle was used during the experiment period. Food
and tap water were available ad libitum. The progres-
sive load training performed by the training groups
consisted of treadmill running on a motordriven
treadmill (DSPT202, qianjiang technology company,
Hangzhou, China), 6 days a week. The complete
training program is shown in Table 1. The training
protocol was determined by a modified program re-
ferring to our previous experiment [9].) At the same
time, the control group was handled and exposed to
the treadmill to control for stress of treadmill envi-
ronment. The experimental protocol was approved by
the Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experi-
mentation of Shanghai University of Sports. The ani-
mals were sacrificed 36h after training to avoid the
acute effect of exercise. In addition, to investigate the
training-induced chronic effects on immune system,
other groups were sacrificed at 7d after training.
Twenty-four female Sprague-Dawley rats were ran-
domly divided into 4 groups: 36 h quiet control
group; 36 h post-training group; 7 d quiet control
group; 7 d post-training group. At 36 h and 7 d after
training, groups of rats were sacrificed, peripheral
blood, plasma and spleens samples were prepared,
and the following variables were measured: plasma
testosterone and corticosterone concentration, pe-
ripheral blood hemoglobin, spleen NKT cells and cy-
tokines (IFN-γ and IL-4).

Series 2
Based on series 1 results, to assess whether
α-GalCer, a synthetic glycolipid agonist of natural
killer T (NKT) cells, can ameliorate exercise-induced
immune imbalance, eighteen animals were divided
into three groups at random: a quiet control group,
post-training control group and post-training
α-GalCer treated group. After the progressive load
training, post-training α-GalCer treated group re-
ceived α-GalCer (Alexis Biochemicals, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) injection 2 times in a week (i.p. at a dose of 100
μg /kg body mass) [10, 11]. The other two groups
were treated i.p. with vehicle alone (0.15% polysor-
bate-20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) under the
same time schedule. Then rats were killed at 7 d
post-training. In order to minimize any diurnal varia-
tion, sampling was performed between 08:00 and l0:00
in all experiments.
Sample collection
The animals were anesthetized with 1% pellto-
barbitalum Natricum (1ml/100g) (wegene
bio-technology company, Shanghai, China). Tube A
and B were heparinized. Peripheral blood was col-
lected in these two tubes from the inferior vena cava.
Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2009, 5

340
The whole blood(50 μl) in tube A is used to detect
hemoglobin. Tube B (500 μl peripheral blood) was
centrifuged at 800g for 20 min. The plasma was col-
lected and stored at -20 oC for testosterone and corti-
costerone analysis. Spleens were harvested and put in
RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen Corporation, Carls-
bad, California, USA) and single spleen cell suspen-
sion was prepared by processing the spleen using a
200-mm nylon mesh. The spleen cell was directly col-
lected in a 35 mm dish which was filled with 4 ml
EZ-Sep Mouse 1X Lymphocyte Separation Medium
(Dakewe Biotech Company Ltd, Shenzhen, China).
Then the cell suspension in Lymphocyte Separation
Medium was transferred into a 15 ml centrifuge tube.
PRIM 1640 medium (1 ml) was layed on it. The tube
was centrifuged at 800g for 30 min at 4 °C. Red blood
cells and dead cells were deposited at the bottom.
Lymphocytes at the interface were collected. Cell
concentration and viability were determined using a
cell counting chamber (Paul Marienfeld GmbH & Co.
KG, Lauda-konigshofen, Germany).
Hemoglobin (Hb) determination
Hb was analyzed by an automatic cytometer
(BC-3000, Shenzhen Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics
CO., Ltd., Shenzhen, China).
Plasma testosterone (T) and corticosterone (C)
ELISA
Plasma testosterone (T) and corticosterone (C)
was measured using ELISA kits purchased from Ad-
litteram Diagnostic Laboratories (Chicago, USA). The
intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) for the T and
C kit was less than 5%. The interassay CV was less
than 10%. Absorbance was read at 450 nm wavelength
using a microplate reader (Bio-rad 550, Bio-Rad
Laboratories. Hercules, California, USA).
Cytokine ELISPOT
Rat IFN-γ and IL-4 ELISPOT kits were pur-
chased from U-CyTech Biosciences (Utrecht, Nether-
lands). Cytokine production by lymphocytes was de-
termined by a modified ELISPOT assay originally
developed by Sedgwick[12] and Czerkinsky[13].
Firstly, we coated 96-well PVDF membrane-bottom
plates(U-CyTech Biosciences) with anti-rat IFN-γ or
IL-4 capture antibody according to manufacturer’s
instructions. After 18 hours, unoccupied sites were
blocked with Bloching solution R(offered by rat
ELISPOT kit). Then, single spleen cell suspensions
were added at different concentrations (3 × 104
cells/well for interferon-γ; 60 × 104 cells/well for IL-4)
in a 100 μl volume of serum-free lymphocyte medium
(Lympho-SpotTM Medium, U-CyTech Biosciences).
For stimulation, spleen cells were incubated with
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA,
Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, USA.) (2.5 ng/ml for de-
tecting IFN-γ or 10 ng/ml for detecting IL-4) and
ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) (0.05
μg/ml for detecting IFN-γ; 0.2 μg/ml for detecting
IL-4). After that, other steps were performed using rat
ELISPOT kit according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. The number of spots was enumerated using an
automated ELISPOT analyzer (BioReader 4000,
Bio-Sys, Karben, Germany) designed to detect spots
with predetermined criteria based on size, shape, and
colorimetric density. Results were expressed by SFC
(spot forming cell).
Flow cytometry for NKT cell
Single spleen cell suspensions (5×105 cells) were
stained with anti-rat CD3 monoclonal antibody [14,
15] and anti-rat CD161a (NKR-P1A) monoclonal an-
tibody (this antibody reacts with NKR-P1A expressed
on all natural killer cells and a small subset of T lym-
phocytes[16]. PE-conjugated A85-1 mAb (anti-mouse
IgG1) was used as isotype control. After staining, red
blood cells were lysed with OptiLyse C Lysing Solu-
tion (Beckman Coulter, California, USA). Finally, the
cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckman
Coulter) using a Coulter EPICS XLTM flow cytometer
with the System ⅡTM software. NKT (NKR-P1+ TCR+)
cells were defined as cells that express both the T cell
receptor and the NK receptor, as described by Oh-
kawa A[17] and Kiyomoto T [18]. Anti-rat CD3-FITC
and anti-rat CD161a-PE (NKR-P1A) monoclonal an-
tibodies were purchased from BD PharMingen (New
Jersey, USA).
Statistical analysis
The effect of training and time was examined by
2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in Series 1.
When a significant effect occurred, paired t-test
analyses were carried out for all indexes. Compari-
sons of data among each experimental group were
performed using one-way ANOVA in Series 2. Data
are presented as means ± standard deviation (SD). A
Spearman rank data correlation analysis was per-
formed to test for correlations. Values of p<0.05 were
considered significant.
Results
In series 1, two-way ANOVA analysis showed a
significant effect of training and time (Table 2). At 36h
post-training, the whole blood Hb, plasma T and C
concentrations were significantly decreased in re-
sponse to exercise training (p < 0.01) (Table 2). At 7 d
after training, the whole blood Hb, plasma T and C
Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2009, 5

concentration was not significantly different from
controls (Table 2). Neither the NKT cell frequency nor
the balance of Th1/Th2 cytokine secretion was sig-
nificantly altered 36 h post-training (Table 2). How-
ever, at 7 d post-training, there was a significant de-
crease in NKT cell frequency compared with controls
(p < 0.01). Furthermore, we observed significant re-
ductions in IFN-γ producing cells (p < 0.05) and sig-
nificant increases in IL-4 producing cells (p < 0.01) in
response to exercise training at this time point when
compared to controls (Table 2). Taken together, these
data showed that exercise training altered Th1/Th2
balance and the frequency of NKT in spleens. Inter-
estingly, NKT cell frequency correlated inversely with
IL-4-producting cells (r = 0.583, p < 0.05).
In series 2, after training, α-GalCer treatment
(twice in the week following training) significant in-
creased the exercise training-induced reduction of
NKT cells compared with untreated training group (p
< 0.05). Moreover, α-GalCer injection significantly
reduced the exercise-induced increase in IL-4 pro-
ducing cells compared with untreated training group
(p < 0.01), while not affecting the number of IFN-γ
producing cells (Figure 1). Thus, we observed that
α-GalCer injection normalized the levels of NKT cells
and IL-4 producing cells in response to exercise
training after training.

Discussion and Conclusions
Reductions in Hb, T and C are often associated
with markers of overtraining[19]. The present study
showed, at 36 h post-training, trained rats had a sig-
nificantly lower Hb, T and C concentration than con-
trol rats indicating an overtrained state. Our previous
work and other researches have found that over-
training in rats provokes the changes of the immune
parameters measured, such as the T cell and B cell
proliferative activity, immunoglobulin [20, 21].
However, there was no data showing the change of
Th1/Th2 lymphocyte in rats after overtraining, ex-
cessive exercise, or fatigue. Therefore, in our work, we
Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2009, 5

342
examined the short-term and long-term effect of
overtraining on Th1/Th2 lymphocytes subsets. Our
result showed a cumulative effect of training, and
thus displayed a more chronic form of immunosup-
pression. This study is the first to demonstrate that
overtraining not only results in an imbalance of
Th1/Th2 lymphocytes, but also lead to changes in
NKT cells as we found a significant exercise-induced
reduction 7 days post-training. NKT cell frequency
was inversely correlated with IL-4-producting cells.
However, we could not establish that the NKT cell
up-regulation was directly related to the decreasing of
IL-4-producting cells.
NKT cells may be able to display flexibility in
their cytokine response and become polarized in ei-
ther the Th1 or Th2 direction. Ligand-activated NKT
cells were originally reported to favor the develop-
ment of a Th2 response, because they were thought to
be primarily IL-4–producing cells in the initial phase
of an immune response. Consistent with this,
α-GalCer was shown to protect in animal models of
Th1-dominated autoimmune disease, such as type1
diabetes [22, 23] and experimental autoimmune en-
cephalomyelitis [24, 25], by inducing Th2 polarization.
However, it has become clear more recently that NKT
cells are not essential for establishing a Th2 response,
as evidenced by the fact that intact Th2 responses are
retained in CD1d- or β2-microglobulin–deficient mice,
which are devoid of NKT cells [26]. Further, some
studies have demonstrated that activated NKT cells
skew immune responses in the opposite direc-
tion--toward the Th1 type [27-30]. Recently, it has
been reported that α-GalCer prevents allergic airway
inflammation, possibly through increased IFN-γ
production, together with the reduced Th2 cytokine
expression by ligand-activated NKT cells [31]. These
data suggest that ligand-activated NKT cells may also
contribute to Th1-mediated responses. Collectively
these data reveal that NKT cell regulation of Th1/Th2
is a complex issue.
Until now, there have been no studies investi-
gating the relativity between NKT cells and Th1/Th2
lymphocyte imbalance after overtraining, excessive
exercise, or fatigue. In the present study, a synthetic
glycolipid agonist of NKT cells, α-GalCer, was used to
demonstrate that NKT cell suppression brought on by
overtraining can be relieved, and that the overtrain-
ing-induced Th1/Th2 lymphocyte imbalance can be
ameliorated. α-GalCer was shown to improve NKT
cell frequencies by about 69% and overtrain-
ing-induced Th1/Th2 lymphocyte imbalance was
prevented by observably decreasing the frequency of
IL-4 secreting cells. Our data showed that α-GalCer
inhibited the exercise-induced increase in Th2 im-
mune responses. Although it is now clear that
α-GalCer is a potent stimulator of cytokine produc-
tion by NKT cells, α-GalCer maybe also activates NK
cells, conventional T cells, and B cells. Therefore,
CD1d or NKT cells knockout rat should be established
if we want to get the conclusion that the NKT cell
upregulation is directly related to the changes of the
cytokine profile. Our results only suggested that
α-GalCer’ effect on the exercise-induced Th1/Th2
lymphocyte imbalance may be correlative with NKT
immunoregulatory cells. Further studies are needed
to verify this postulate. This is the first report to
demonstrate a potential role for α-GalCer in the
treatment of exercise-induced immune imbalance,
which might represent a strategy for the treatment
this exercise-induced disorder.
In conclusion, α-GalCer played an important
modulatory role in the exercise-induced Th1/Th2
lymphocyte imbalance, which may be correlative with
NKT immunoregulatory cells. Since athletes with
immune imbalance have reduced numbers of NKT
cells, therapies aimed at the in vivo activation of NKT
cells maybe help maintain normal immune function in
athletes. Additionally, our finding that NKT cells are
capable of expansion after repeated in vivo activation
may have implications for designing NKT cell-based
therapies for other chronic immunological diseases.
