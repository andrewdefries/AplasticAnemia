CORTISONE AND ACTH IN HYPOPLASTIC ANEMIA*
A. J. ERSLEV, C. K. IVERSON,t AND F. D. LAWRASONt
For many years hypoplastic or aplastic anemia has been identified with
a confusing group of pancytopenias which are refractory to treatment.
Recently The Committee for Clarification of the Nomenclature of Cells and
Diseases of the Blood and Blood-forming Organs has redefined the term
hypoplastic anemia and discarded the term aplastic anemia."3 Hypoplastic
anemia is defined by this committee as a pancytopenia caused by actual
hypocellularity of the bone marrow. This definition probably embraces
many diseases with different etiologies but it does place in a single category
all cases of pancytopenia due to hypocellularity of the bone marrow.
In most reports of pancytopenias which are refractory to treatment no
clear differentiation has been made between cases with hypocellularity and
those with hypercellularity of the marrow. This fact makes it hard to draw
conclusions concerning the etiology and prognosis of true hypoplastic
anemia. There seem to be two distinct types of hypoplastic anemia. One is
acute and fulminating and usually is associated with a definite history of
exposure to an agent toxic for bone marrow. Avoidance of exposure to this
agent not infrequently is followed by spontaneous recovery. The other type
is chronic and slowly progressive over a period of months or years. In most
of the chronic cases it is not possible to obtain a history of significant
exposure to toxins. Recovery from the chronic type of hypoplastic anemia
occurs only rarely and unpredictably and apparently is spontaneous rather
than due to any specific treatment. No agent has been found which will
induce regeneration of the bone marrow in acute or chronic hypoplastic
anemia.
Soon after the introduction of cortisone and ACTH in the treatment of
a variety of diseases it was discovered that they would often correct a
complicating anemia or leukopenia. These findings suggested that cortisone
and ACTH had a stimulatory effect on hematopoiesis and might be useful
in the treatment of hypoplastic anemia.2
The response of normal bone marrow to cortisone and ACTH has not
been fully evaluated. Hills"0 and Forsham7 reported a moderate neutrophilic
leukocytosis in normal individuals four hours after a single dose of ACTH
but this observation can hardly be interpreted as evidence for stimulation of
bone marrow. Administration of ACTH over a period of several days,

however, produced a marked neutrophilia in two normal volunteers.10 On
the other hand, there have been no reports of significant changes in the
number of reticulocytes, red blood cells, and platelets or in the bone marrow
of normal individuals following administration of ACTH or cortisone. The
eosinopenic effect of cortisone and ACTH probably is unrelated to bone
marrow function.6
Although cortisone and ACTH have frequently corrected a mild compli-
cating anemia or leukopenia in patients with chronic rheumatoid arthritis6"8
or disseminated lupus erythematosis,15 this response usually has been associ-
ated with general improvement in the signs and symptoms of the underlying
disease. In patients with severe hematological diseases such as acute leuke-
mia,3'11 idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura,8 agranulocytosis,l and ac-
quired hemolytic anemia,' the effect of ACTH or cortisone has occasionally
been striking and has produced an almost complete reversal of the bone
marrow to normal. However, in both instances it has been felt that the
hematological remissions were not due to a direct stimulating effect of the
hormones on the bone marrow, but rather to a suppression of the underlying
disorder.
Yet it seems possible that cortisone and ACTH may have a direct
stimulating effect on bone marrow. Hill and Hunter9 have reported four
cases of refractory anemia with isolated hypoplasia of the erythropoietic
tissue where ACTH caused a dramatic remission in one case and delayed,
more questionable remissions in the other three. In the discussion of
their paper, four similar cases were reported, all of whom responded well
to ACTH. A small but definite leukocytosis and reticulocytosis were seen
in all of twenty cases of diffuse collagen diseases treated by S. C. Finch.
Rosenberg has reported leukocytosis up to 20,000-25,000 in some cases
following the administration of corticotrophins.'2 Furthermore, spontaneous
adrenal hyperactivity, such as is seen in Cushing's disease, usually is
accompanied by leukocytosis,5 and occasionally by a true polycythemia.'
In order to test the effect of cortisone or ACTH on an inactive hypo-
plastic bone marrow six cases of hypoplastic anemia were treated with
these hormones.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The cases presented were admitted for study to the Grace-New Haven Community
Hospital during the past year. Each patient had a marked leukopenia, thrombocyto-
penia, and normochromic anemia. Bone marrow aspirations and biopsies revealed fatty
replacement of the marrows, with a relative increase in the number of lymphocytes and
plasma cells. Five cases were diagnosed as having chronic hypoplastic anemia, while
one case (IV) had acute hypoplastic anemia. In one of the chronic cases (V) and in
the acute case (IV) there were histories of brief exposure to subtoxic doses of benzol
many months prior to the onset of symptoms. Case VI (reported through the courtesy
of Dr. David H. Clement) a young boy, aged seven, also had multiple congenital
malformations which suggested a diagnosis of Fanconi's syndrome. However, the pan-
cytopenia had not been present before the age of three (Table 1).

Five patients received cortisone acetate (Merck and Co.) and one patient received
ACTH (Armour) (Table 1). Transfusions and antibiotics were administered when
necessary. Every other day the patients had leucocyte counts, reticulocyte counts,
platelet counts (Rees-Ecker method), and hemoglobin determinations (photoelectric
determination of oxyhemoglobin). Bone marrow aspirations (BM on graphs) from
multiple sites, with examination of marrow particles squeezed between two slides,
were carried out before and after the course of therapy.

RESULTS
All six cases uniformly failed to respond to cortisone or ACTH. In Case
V there was a definite but temporary rise in the number of leukocytes,
platelets, and reticulocytes, but repeated bone marrow aspirations and one
bone marrow biopsy did not reveal the slightest increase in activity (Graph
3). In cases II, III, and VI a moderate but short lasting rise in the number
of neutrophilic leukocytes occurred and in case I there was a rise in the
number of reticulocytes (Graphs 1, 2, and 3). However, the bone marrows
in all cases remained hypoplastic without exhibiting signs of regeneration.
The purpuric tendencies, increased capillary fragilities, or prolonged
bleeding times were not altered by treatment in any of the six cases.
DIscUSSION
In the last few years cortisone and ACTH have been used more or less
empirically in the treatment of many diseases. Hematological remissions
YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
have been reported in a number of these, such as acute leukemia, diffuse
collagen diseases, agranulocytosis, refractory anemia, acquired hemolytic
anemia and essential thrombocytopenic purpura. A polymorphonuclear
leukocytosis and a reticulocytosis have also been observed in many patients
during treatment. These observations led to the suggestion that ACTH and
cortisone exert a direct effect on hematopoietic tissue and might be of value
in the treatment of patients with a deficiency in function of the bone marrow
such as that which occurs in patients with hypoplastic anemia.'

Hypoplastic anemia is defined as a pancytopenia caused by a hypocellular
bone marrow.'3 This hypoplasia is probably due to an eradication or a
depression of normal hematopoietic tissue. In the acute type of hypoplastic
anemia there is often a history of repeated or excessive exposure to a
substance toxic for bone marrow or to irradiation. The acute fulminating
course of the disease seems to indicate that a toxic destruction of bone
marrow rather than a depression has taken place. In this type it is unlikely
that any bone marrow stimulant would be of much therapeutic value. In the
chronic type there is usually no convincing history of exposure to excessive
doses of an agent toxic for bone marrow. Furthermore, the chronic course
of the disease makes it unlikely that acute destruction of the hematopoietic
tissue has occurred. The failure to develop extramedullary hematopoiesis
and the striking morphological resemblance between the bone marrow in
48
CORTISONE IN ANEMIA
chronic hypoplastic anemia and normal, inactive yellow bone marrow sug-
gest that the hypoplasia is caused by a chronic depression of hematopoietic
tissue. Small doses of various toxins might in some way cause this cellular
depression either directly or by interfering with the production of a normal
hematopoietic stimulant. In any case, it seems possible that the bone marrow
of chronic hypoplastic anemia is merely dormant and potentially able to
respond if exposed to the proper stimulating agent.

CASE Ir TM. CASE M RW
ACTH or cortisone was administered to five cases of chronic and one
case of acute hypoplastic anemia in doses which have induced hematological
remissions in other diseases. However, in these six cases the bone marrow
failed to respond and the pancytopenia progressed unchecked. The small rise
in the number of leukocytes and reticulocytes observed in some of the
patients was not sustained or associated with any bone marrow changes and
probably was caused by a release of preformed elements into the circulation.
In the literature only brief mention has been made of similar cases of
true hypoplastic anemia treated with cortisone or ACTH.6' ', 15,16 The
results seem to have been poor except for one case9 where there was a very
suggestive regeneration of the erythropoitic tissue but no improvement of
the leukopenia or thrombocytopenia.
Assuming that the bone marrow in chronic hypoplastic anemia is merely
inactive and not irrevocably damaged, the results in the five cases presented
49
50 YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
here strongly suggest that cortisone and ACTH have no direct stimulating
action on bone marrow. The hematological remissions described following
treatment with ACTH and cortisone in a number of diseases were probably
the result of more normal conditions which prevailed after a primary dis-
order had been corrected, rather than the result of a direct stimulation of
the marrow. The sustained leukocytosis and reticulocytosis observed in
some cases treated with these hormones cannot be explained at present.
SUMMARY
. Five cases of chronic and one case of acute hypoplastic anemia were
treated with cortisone or ACTH for from 7 to 20 days. No significant
changes were observed in the hypoplastic bone marrows. Aside from small,
temporary changes in the leukocyte and reticulocyte counts, the pancyto-
penia continued unchecked.
