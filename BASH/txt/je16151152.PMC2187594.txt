A possible role for natural killer (NK)~ cells in regulating hematopoiesis was
originally suggested by Cudkowicz and Hochman (1) and Kiessling et al. (2), in
the mouse system. These authors showed that parental hematopoietic or lymph-
oid grafts do not survive in lethally irradiated F1 hybrids, even though these
animals are universal recipients of grafts of other types of parental tissues.
Experiments (3, 4) evaluating the formation of colonies or the proliferation of
bone marrow stem cells in the recipient spleen showed that cells with NK
characteristics are responsible for the graft rejection. Direct destruction of bone
marrow cells in vivo by NK cells has also been observed in experiments in which
the clearance of ~25I-uridine-labeled bone marrow cells after intravenous inoc-
ulation was measured (5). In humans, NK cells have been shown to react with
cells from different lineages at early stages of differentiation, such as immature
thyrnocytes (6, 7), bone marrow cells (6), and myeloid leukemic cells (8). Lym-
phocytes with NK cell characteristics are able to inhibit both myeloid and
erythroid colony formation in vitro (9-15). There is also evidence for a possible
pathogenetic in vivo role of such suppressor lymphocytes in patients with pure
red cell aplasia associated with B cell chronic lymphatic leukemia (16, 17), aplastic
anemia (18), and, more recently, in patients with NK lymphocytosis, in which
the salient clinical feature is neutropenia (19, 20).
Inhibition of hematopoiesis in vitro has been variously ascribed to direct
interaction of NK cells with sensitive immature hemopoietic cell targets (6, 8,
1!), to release of soluble factors from lymphocytes upon allogeneic or mitogenic
stimulation (21, 22), or to both mechanisms operating together. Several soluble
cell products, produced by different cell types, have also been shown to mediate
suppression of hematopoietic colony formation. Among these are: (a) lactoferrin,

which acts on macrophages to inhibit the production of colony-stimulatingfactor
(CSF) for granulocyte-monocyte colony-forming units (CFU-GM), and the mac-
rophage-dependent induction of CSF production by T cells (23); (b) isoferritin
and acidic isoferritin (or leukemia-inhibiting activity) (24); (c) prostaglandins (25);
and (d) interferon (IFN)-,, -/3,and -y (22, 26). Tumor necrosis factor, produced
by endotoxin-stimulated macrophages (27, 28) and B cell lines, and lymphotoxins,
produced mainly by T and B cells upon antigenic or mitogenic stimulation (29),
are two other classes of cytostatic/cytotoxicfactors that could affect proliferation
of hematopoietic precursors. Upon interaction with NK-sensitive target cells,
NK cells release a cytotoxic factor (NKCF) that may be the mediator of NK cell
cytotoxicity (30).
To determine whether NK cells participate in hemopoietic homeostasis, either
by direct cell-to-cell contact or through release of soluble factors, we studied the
effect of highly homogeneous NK cell preparations and soluble factors derived
from them on colony formation from bone marrow cells. We report here that
human NK cells in vitro inhibit growth of multipotent, early CFU-GM and
erythroid precursor ceils from ailogeneic and autologous bone marrow cells.
Upon culture with bone marrow cell preparations enriched for precursor cells
and with NK-sensitive target cells, human NK cells release a factor(s) able to
inhibit colony growth with the same specificity as the effector NK cells.
Materials and Methods
Cell Lines. The human erythromyeloidleukemic cell line K562, the macrophage line
U937, the B cell line Raji, and the mouse mastocytoma line P815y were maintained in
culture in RPMI 1640 medium (Flow Laboratories, Inc., Rockville, MD) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Flow Laboratories, Inc.). All cell lines used were
repeatedly tested and constantly found free of mycoplasma contamination by Hoechst
fluorescent staining for cytoplasmic DNA and by direct anaerobic agar-plate cultivation.
Monoclonal Antibodies. Antibody B73.1 (IgG1) reacts with the receptor for the Fc
fragment of IgG (FcR) present on human NK cells and neutrophilic granulocytes, and
detects virtually all resting and IFN-induced NK cells (31, 32); antibody B36.1 (IgG2b)
reacts with the 69,000 dalton surface molecule (T1 antigen) present on all peripheral
blood T cells (32); B116.1 (IgG2a) reacts with the 30,000 and 32,000 dalton chains that
constitute the T8 antigen on suppressor/cytotoxic T cellsand on a proportion of NK cells
(32); B66.6 (IgGl) reacts with the 55,000 dalton protein that constitutes the T4 antigen
present on helper T cells. These antibodies, and the anti-HLA-DR common determinant
antibody B33.1 (IgG2a) (32, 33) have all been produced in our laboratory. The anti-NK
antibody N901 (IgGl) (34) was kindly provided by Dr. J. Griffin (Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute, Boston, MA). Antibody HNK-1 (IgM)(35), which reacts with a variable propor-
tion of NK and T cells in the peripheral blood (31, 36), was produced from cellcultures
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville,MD).Supernatants from
the hybrid cell lineswere used throughout this study.
Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes (PBL) and PBL Subpopulations. Peripheral blood was
obtained by venipuncture from healthy donors and anticoagulated with preservative-free
heparin. Mononuclear cells were prepared by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll/
Hypaque (F/H) (1.077 4- 0.01 g/ml) and depleted of monocytes by adherence to plastic
for 45 min at 37°C. PBL subpopulations were obtained by indirect rosetting of antibody-
sensitized PBL with CrCl3-treated, anti-mouse Ig-coated sheep erythrocytes (E),accord-
ing to our previously described technique (31, 33). The goat F(ab')z anti-mouse Ig
(Cappel Laboratories, CochranviUe, PA) used was preabsorbed with human Ig and
immunopurified on a mouse Ig-CNBr Sepharose (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala,
Sweden) column as described (3I). Both antibody-positive (rosetting) and -negative (non-
1154 INHIBITION OF HEMOPOIETIC COLONIES BY NK CELLS
rosetting) populations were recovered after F/H density gradient centrifugation, and
contaminating E were lysed hypotonically.
Bone Marrow Cell Preparations. Rib bone marrow cells were purified from specimens
(kindly provided by Dr. P. Addonizio, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) which
were routinely removed during thoracic surgery. The marrow was collected in sterile
RPMI 1640-10% FBS and sequentially flushed with medium through 18, 23, and 27
gauge needles, and the cell suspension was layered on an F/H density gradient (1.077 g/
ml). Mononuclear cells collected at the interface were washed three times with RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. In the indicated experiments, the mononuclear cells
were depleted of mature monocytes and other adherent cells by two cycles of adherence
to plastic surfaces. The resulting population was further separated into HLA-DR÷ and
HLA-DR- ceils by indirect rosetting (as described above) after sensitizing the cells with
monoclonal antibody B33.1. Approximately 10-15% of the bone marrow cells were
recovered in the HLA-DR÷ fraction, which contained virtually all CFU-GM.
Bone Marrow Colonies. CFU-GEMM (mixed granulocytes, erythroid, monocyte, and
megakaryocyte CFU) were set up using a modification of the method of Fauser and
Messner (37). Briefly, bone marrow cells were resuspended (105/ml) in 0.9% methylcel-
lulose (Fisher Scientific Co., Pittsburgh, PA) in RPMI 1640 containing 30% FBS, 5%
conditioned medium from phytohemagglutinin (PHA-HA 15; Wellcome Research Labo-
ratories, Beckenham, England)-stimulated (7-d culture) peripheral blood leukocytes (PHA-
CM) (106/ml) (38), 5 X 10-5 M 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis,
MO), and human urine erythropoietin (1 IU/ml) (EPO) (lot 1668; Toyobo Co. Ltd., New
York). 1-ml aliquots of the cell suspension were seeded into 35-mm culture petri dishes
(Lux Scientific, Inc., Newbury Park, CA) and cultured at 37°C in a 5% COs humidified
atmosphere in air. The number of colonies was scored on day 14 of culture. Mixed
colonies were individually harvested from the dishes, smears were prepared, and morpho-
logical analysis was performed after staining with Wright's-Giemsa.
The BFU-E (burst-forming units, erythroid) assay was performed according to Ogawa
(39). Bone marrow cells were suspended (105/ml) in 0.8% methylcellulose (Fisher Scientific
Co.) in a medium (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, NY) containing 30% FBS, 1%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Calbiochem-Behring Corp., La Jolla, CA), 10-4 M 2-ME,
and human EPO (2 IU/ml). 1-ml aliquots of the cells were cultured and scored on day 14
of culture as described for CFU-GEMM. Cell aggregates containing >500 cells were
scored as colonies.
The CFU-E (CFU, erythroid) assay was performed using the same experimental
conditions as for BFU-E, but were scored on day 7 of culture. Cell aggregates containing
>10 but <500 cells were scored as colonies.
The CFU-GM assay was performed according to the method of Pike and Robinson
(40), with slight modification. Medium conditioned by the Detroit 554 cell line (DET-
CM), kindly provided by Dr. R. K. Shadduck (Montefiore Hospital, University of Pitts-
burgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA), was used as a source of colony-stimulating
factor (CSF) (41). Bone marrow cells were resuspended (105]ml) in 0.3% agar (Difco
Laboratories, Inc., Detroit, MI) in supplemented McCoy's medium (Gibco Laboratories),
containing 10% CSF. The cells were cultured as described above, and colonies (aggregates
containing >50 cells) were scored on days 7 and 14 of culture. Colony growth on day 7
evaluates differentiation and proliferation of more mature GM precursor cells (late CFU-
GM); colony growth on day 14 evaluates these parameters in more primitive cells (early
CFU-GM). All cultures were performed in triplicate. The results for CFU-GEMM are
expressed as number of colonies per 106 plated cells; those of BFU-E, CFU-E, and CFU-
GM are expressed as number of colonies per 105 plated cells. The same lots of FBS, EPO,
DET-CM, and PHA-CM were used throughout.
Assayfor Inhibition of Colony Growth by PBL and PBL Subsets. To test the direct effect
of PBL on bone marrow colony formation, effector cells (PBL or PBL subpopulations)
were incubated for 18 h at 37°C in RPMI 1640, 10% FBS in a humdified 5% COs
atmosphere in air with bone marrow cells at a 2:1 ratio of PBL to bone marrow cell (final
cell concentration, 3 X 106 cells/ml). The cells were then washed three times with RPMI
DEGL1ANTONI ET AL. 1155
1640, 10% FBS, and plated (105 bone marrow cells per dish) for the different types of
colonies as described above. In each experiment, colony formation by precursor cells
possibly present in the PBL preparations was tested under the same experimental condi-
tions described above using 2 x 105 PBL/dish. The effect of soluble factors on colony
formation was tested by adding supernatants (100 #1 or the quantities indicated in Fig. I)
at the time of addition of the bone marrow cells or at the indicated time after seeding to
triplicate dishes.
ProductionofSupernatant Fluidsfrom PBL CoculturedWith CellLines or WithBoneMarrow
Cells. PBL and the different PBL subpopulations were resuspended (5 × 106 cells/ml)
in RPMI 1640, 10% FBS with or without 103 U/ml partially purified IFN-a (106 U/mg;
Interferon Sciences, New Brunswick, NJ) and incubated for 18 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2
humidified atmosphere in tissue culture flasks (Falcon Labware, Becton, Dickinson & Co.,
Oxnard, CA). After culture, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (pH 7.2), and resuspended (3 × 106/ml) in RPMI 1640, 10% FBS containing
K562, Raji, or P815y cells (6 × 105/ml final concentration). After 6 h culture at 37°C,
the cells were centrifuged and cell-free supernatants were harvested. Control supernatants
were prepared using either effector or target cells alone under the same experimental
conditions as above. Supernatants were also obtained using as inducers either total
mononuclear bone marrow cells, nonadherent mononuclear bone marrow cells, or HLA-
DR (+ and -) bone marrow subpopulations (3 × 106 cells/ml final concentration).
Supernatants were either used immediately or kept frozen at -70 °C until used.
[SH]Thymidine ([~H]TdR) Incorporation. Nonadherent mononuclear bone marrow
cells, HLA-DR (+ and -) subpopulations obtained therefrom, and cell lines lines (Raji,
U937, P815y) were resuspended in RPMI 1640 10% FBS supplemented or not with
DET-CM (10% final concentration) and PBL supernatant prepared as described above
(50% final concentration). 200 #1 of the cell suspension (5 × 10" cells) were plated in each
well of flat-bottomed microtiter tissue cuhure~lates and cultured for 96 h at 37°C. 6 h
before harvesting, the cells were pulsed with [ H]TdR (sp act, 2 Ci/mmol; New England
Nuclear, Boston, MA) at 2 #Ci/weil. The cells were collected on glass fiber filters using
an automatic cell harvester (Skatron Co., Sterling, VA), and cell-incorporated [~H]TdR
was assayed by liquid scintillation counting.
Results
Inhibition of Bone Marrow Hematopoietic Colonies by Human NK Cells. Human
bone marrow cells were preincubated for 18 h at 37 °C with allogeneic PBL and
then washed and plated for colony formation. Growth of early CFU-GM and
CFU-E was significantly inhibited, compared with that of bone marrow cells
incubated without PBL, whereas late CFU-GM and BFU-E were not affected
(Table I). The inhibitory effect exerted by PBL was enhanced when PBL were
preincubated with IFN. The number of colonies formed by 2 × 10~ total PBL
alone was 1.7 _+ 1.8 early CFU-GM, 2.0 + 1.4 BFU-E, and 0.5 + 0.8 CFU-
GEMM. HLA-DR + PBL preparations formed 4.7 ___1.4 early CFU-GM and 2.0
+ 0.0 BFU-E; no late CFU-GM or CFU-E was ever derived from peripheral
blood. PBL were separated into B73.1 (+ and -) cells by indirect rosetting, and
allogeneic bone marrow cells were preincubated before plating with the two
lymphocyte subsets, each separately. B73.1 + cells inhibited formation of CFU-
GEMM, CFU-E, and early CFU-GM, but they did not inhibit either BFU-E or
late CFU-GM colony growth. The inhibitory effect was increased when the
B73.1 + cells were pretreated with IFN, whereas no significant inhibition of
colony formation was observed after preincubation of bone marrow cells with
B73.1- cells, even when they were prestimulated with IFN-a.

lated with purified IFN-a (10s U/ml per 5 × 108 cells), and then cultured in the presence of
K562 cells. Increasing amounts of cell-free supernatants were added to mononuclear cells
from one bone marrow sample during CFU-GM colony growth assay. Colonies were scored
on day 7 (A) and on day 14 (0) of culture. Error bars represent standard deviation. The

was observed with supernatants from IFN-a-treated PBL. No inhibition of colony
formation was observed using supernatants obtained from either B73.1- cells or
from both B73.1 (+ and -) cells incubated with the NK-insensitive target Raji
or with HLA-DR- bone marrow cells, independent of IFN prestimulation. The
inhibitory effect of the NK-derived supernatants on early CFU-GM colony
formation was dose dependent (Fig. 1) and reached a plateau starting at super-
natant concentrations of 10% (100 gi/dish). By contrast, even 200 pl supernatant
per dish failed to inhibit late CFU-GM. When supernatants produced by PBL
cultured with K562 target cells were tested for their effect on the growth of
different types of colonies, the results were similar. As shown in Fig. 2, super-
natants from total PBL and, to a greater extent, those from B73.1 ÷ PBL,
significantly inhibited CFU-GEMM, CFU-E, and early CFU-GM colony forma-
tion, but not BFU-E and late CFU-GM. This pattern of reactivity is analogous
to that observed upon direct incubation of bone marrow cells with PBL subpop-
ulations, without a change in the specificity. Pretreatment of PBL with IFN-a
increased the level of inhibition obtained with the supernatants. Supernatants
from B73.1- PBL, with or without prestimulation by IFN-a, did not inhibit
colony formation.
Lymphocyte Subset that Inhibits Early CFU-GM Growth Also Produces Colony-
inhibiting Activity (CIA). To test whether the PBL subset able to directly inhibit
colony formation was also responsible for the production of CIA, the effect of
preincubation of the bone marrow cells with the different lymphocyte subsets on
early CFU-GM colony formation was compared with that of supernatants from
the same PBL subsets cultured with K562 cells. The large majority of cells that
directly inhibited CFU-GM and that produced CIA were recovered in the B73.1 ÷
and in the N901 + population (Table III), which also contained the cells with NK
activity (not shown). Cells bearing HLA-DR antigens or T ceil-specific B36.1
(Leu-1) or B66.6 (T4) antigens were unable to mediate either activity even after
IFN induction. Cells suppressing colony formation as well as those producing
CIA-containing supernatants were almost equally distributed among the HNK-1
(+ and -) and the B116.1 (T8) (+ and -) subsets. However, the B116.1 + subset

treatment increased the efficiency of the cell subsets able to mediate both
activities.
CIA-containing Supernatants Inhibit Colony Formation by Autologous Bone Mar-
row. Supernatants from B73.1 (+ and -) cells were tested for CIA on autologous
bone marrow ceils (Table IV). Supernatants obtained from both subpopulations
cultured in the absence of inducer did not have any effect on either CFU-GM
(early and late) or BFU-E. Supernatants produced by B73.1 + cells (but not by
the respective B73.1- population), upon culture with K562 cells, were able to
inhibit early CFU-GM but not BFU-E colony formation when tested on autolo-
gous bone marrow cells. Slight inhibition was also observed on late CFU-GM
colony growth.

1162 INHIBITION OF HEMOPOIETIC COLONIES BY NK CELLS
Discussion
We have shown that human NK cells exert an inhibitory effect on hematopoi-
etic cells and that, when cultured with either HLA-DR+ bone marrow cells or
NK-sensitive target cells, they produce a soluble factor(s) that inhibits in vitro
colony formation from allogeneic and autologous bone marrow cells.
Colony growth of CFU-GEMM, CFU-E, and early CFU-GM was significantly
inhibited when bone marrow ceils were preincubated with PBL, and this inhibi-
tion was enhanced in IFN-treated PBL. No effect on the number of BFU-E or
late CFU-GM was observed. Our results from experiments using purified lym-
phocyte preparations show that inhibition with identical specificity is obtained
when B73.1 + NK cells are incubated with bone marrow cells. These data confirm
and extend previous reports showing that cell preparations enriched for NK cells
on the basis of their physical properties (density) (9) or surface phenotype (e.g.,
HNK-1 + cells [15], FcR+ [11, 16, 18], E-rosetting and -nonrosetting cells [13,
14]) suppress CFU-E, BFU-E, and CFU-GM bone marrow colonies. We now
report that proliferation and differentiation of muitipotent CFU-GEMM precur-
sor cells are also efficiently inhibited by NK cells. These data, showing that the
most primitive precursor cells identifiable in humans are inhibited by NK cells
in vitro, are similar to the data reported in the murine model in vivo, in which
NK cells appear to affect pluripotent stem cells (1, 2). Our data contrast with
previous studies which indicated that 7-d CFU-GM are inhibited by NK cell-
containing PBL preparations (9-15). There are two likely possibilities to account
for this discrepancy. First, in those studies, IFN-3, might have been produced
during the culture that acted synergistically with NK-CIA to inhibit late CFU-
GM growth. We did not detect significant amounts of IFN in our supernatants;
however, particular batches of FBS or CSF preparations may either induce or
contain different quantities of IFN-'y, contributing to the observed effect. Alter-
natively, different CSF preparations may drive myeloid differentiation differently
and thus the difference in results may only be superficial. The inability of NK
cells to suppress BFU-E colonies is consistent with findings in other studies (15,
16), which have all shown that this type of colony is much more resistant to the
inhibitory effect of NK cells than are CFU-E or CFU-GM. In our experiments,
the number of precursor cells present in the PBL preparations added to the
bone marrow cells was not sufficient to affect the measured extent of inhibition,
due to the low PBL-to-bone marrow cell ratio used. However, the possibility
remains that some of the PBL preparations produced factors that enhanced
colony formation, thereby partially or completely masking the inhibitory effects.
Due to the difficulty in obtaining peripheral blood and bone marrow samples
from the same donors, all the experiments of NK cell-mediated inhibition were
done in ailogeneic combinations. However, previous studies (13, 18) have shown
that the effect of NK cells on colony formation is identical in allogeneic and
autologous combinations and that a genetic restriction, as described for bone
marrow rejection in the murine system (1, 2), can not be readily demonstrated
in vitro with human cells.
Previous studies on the effect of human NK cells on hematopoiesis did not
unambiguously characterize effector cells as NK cells on the basis of specific
surface markers; thus, a role for effector cells other than NK was not excluded.
DEGLIANTONI ET AL. 1163
Using NK cells purified on the basis of two independent NK-specific surface
antigens, i.e., the FcR for immune complexes detected by antibody B73.1 (31,
32) and the antigen detected by antibody N901 (34), we determined that the
cells responsible for both spontaneous and IFN-induced cell-mediated colony
suppression were NK ceils. Moreover, the results of independent experiments
with cell populations enriched for or depleted of NK cells, using a series of
monoclonal antibodies reacting with antigens specifically present on different
lymphocyte subsets, confirm that the cells inhibiting colony formation bear only,
and all, those markers known to be present on fresh NK cells (32, 36). The
absence of colony inhibition with HLA-DR÷ or T 1 antigen (B36.1 +) lymphocytes
excludes a role for monocytes and B cells, or for T cells, respectively, in mediating
the inhibitory effect. Like NK cells, the cells responsible for colony inhibition
are distributed among both B116.1 (TS) (+ and -) (36, 42) and HNK-1 (+ and
-) (36, 43) lymphocytes. Alloantigen-stimulated cytotoxic T8 + T lymphocytes
have been shown to suppress CFU-C colony formation (45). Under our experi-
mental conditions, only cells with the NK phenotype, within the T8 ÷ population,
and not T8 ÷ T cells, are responsible for the inhibition of colonies, because T8 +
cells purified from cells previously depleted of B73.1 + NK cells are not inhibitory.
In all cell preparations depleted of NK cells, including B73.1- cells, production
of a modest, but significant, level of CIA was occasionally observed, especially
after IFN-o~ pretreatment of the cells. In the latter case, the supernatants have
been shown to contain small titers of IFN, always <10 U/ml. This level of IFN-
a, in control experiments, induced only minimal inhibition of colony formation,
but may contribute to the observed inhibition by these supernatants. We also
cannot exclude the possibility of a small contamination, by a few NK cells or by
other cells with IFN-induced, NK-like activity, of the NK cell-depleted prepa-
ration.
The inhibitory effect exerted by NK cells could be mediated through direct
cell-to-cell contact that results in killing of the precursor cells, or through release
of cytotoxic or cytostatic factors, either acting at distance or concentrated in the
milieu surrounding the target cells. Because immature hemopoietic (lymphoid
or myeloid) cells had been shown to be targets for NK cell-dependent killing (4,
6-8), and because NK cells can be induced to produce several soluble factors
upon culture with NK-sensitive target cells (30) or when stimulated by several
inducers (45), we tested supernatants from NK cells cocultured with NK-sensitive
and -insensitive targets or with allogeneic bone marrow ceils for their effect on
colony formation. Supernatants from 6-h cultures of NK cells with NK-sensitive
K562 or HLA-DR÷ bone marrow cells, but not with the NK-insensitive Raji or
with HLA-DR- bone marrow cells, contained a factor (NK-CIA) that inhibited
colonies with the same pattern of specificity as NK cells. Further, the population
with NK cell characteristics responsible for cell-mediated colony suppression was
also responsible for the NK-CIA production induced by K562 and by bone
marrow cells. NK-CIA suppresses colony formation from bone marrow cells that
are both autologous and allogeneic to the producer lymphocytes. NK cells
produce NK cytotoxic factor (NKCF) (30) under all the experimental conditions
in which NK-CIA is produced. Mycoplasm contamination does not account for
NK-CIA and NKCF production because (a) the bone marrow cells used for the
1164 INHIBITION OF HEMOPO1ETIC COLONIES BY NK CELLS
induction were freshly obtained, and (b) all the cell lines used (both inducers and
noninducers of NK-CIA) were constantly found to be free of mycoplasma
contamination. The production of NK-CIA during incubation of NK cells with
bone marrow cells and the identical specificity of colony inhibition mediated
directly by NK cells or by NK-CIA strongly suggest that the effect of NK cells
on hematopoietic progenitors is partially or completely mediated through the
release of NK-CIA. The concentration of NK-CIA that was reached in the
medium during the preincubation of NK cells with bone marrow cells in the
experiments of direct cell-mediated inhibition is sufficient to account for the
inhibitory effect of NK cells. The fact that both the hematopoietic precursor
cells affected by NK cells and the cells inducing NK-CIA (and NKCF) production
are contained in the HLA-DR÷ fraction of bone marrow cells suggests that the
same cells that act as target cells for NK cells, also induce production of NK-
CIA. Similarly, a good, although not absolute, correlation has been shown (30)
between sensitivity of cell lines to NK cells and their ability to induce NKCF
production. Several pieces of correlative evidence suggest that NKCF and NK-
CIA activity might be mediated by the same factor, and studies are in progress
for the biochemical identification of this factor. Neither a nor ~, IFN was present
at a significant level in the NK-CIA preparation, and antisera or monoclonal
antibodies against the two types of IFN did not block the activity of NK-CIA.2
However, IFN-y acts synergisticallywith NK-CIA, and the simultaneous addition
to the colony assay of IFN-y and NK-CIA resulted in significant inhibition of
late (day 7) CFU-GM colonies that are not inhibited by either factor separately,z
The effect of NK-CIA on the bone marrow precursor cells may be cytotoxic
or cytostatic and it is difficult, at present, to distinguish between these two
possibilities. Massive toxicity in bone marrow preparations incubated with NK-
CIA was not evidenced in the dye exclusion assay. A modest cytotoxicityon bone
marrow cells, mediated by NK cell-enriched PBL, was demonstrated in 5~Cr
release assay, but we could not demonstrate a significant cytotoxicity of NK-
CIA-containing supernatants, even when HLA-DR+bone marrow cells were used
as targets, in the same types of assays. These findings may depend on the fact
that the proportion of target cells lysed by NK-CIA is low within bone marrow
cells, and only the colony inhibition test is sensitive for NK-CIA detection.
Alternatively, NK-CIA might affect proliferation, as suggested by the observation
that NK-CIA-containing supernatants inhibited [~H]TdR incorporation in 4-d
culture of CSF-induced HLA-DR÷ bone marrow cells. Significant [3H]TdR
incorporation was observed in the HLA-DR÷ cells and also in the HLA-DR-
population upon CSF induction, probably due to relatively mature cells (e.g.,
promyelocytes) in the latter subset still able to proliferate in response to CSF.
NK-CIA inhibited [~H]TdR incorporation only from proliferating HLA-DR+
and not from HLA-DR- cells. This may depend on lack of NK-CIA receptors or
on resistance of more mature cells to the cytotoxic or cytostatic effect of NK-
CIA. The effect of NK-CIA on the precursor cells occurred in the first 2 d of
culture; after that time, at 37°C, the activity of NK-CIA was completely lost.

DEGLIANTONI ET AL. 1165
Several lines of evidence suggest that NK-CIA acts directly on the precursor cells
and that its action is not mediated through activation of other cell types. The
nonadherent HLA-DR+ bone marrow cells that we used were depleted of mature
monocytes/macrophages, T cells, and NK cells, as well as of cells of myeioid or
erythroid lineage more mature than blasts; colony growth was still inhibited by
NK-CIA. These cell preparations can also effectively absorb NK-CIA activity,
whereas HLA-DR~-cells cannot. 2 Inhibition of colony formation was observed
when total or HLA-DR+ bone marrow cells were incubated for 6 h at 20°C with
NK-CIA-containing supernatants, washed, and cultured in standard medium.
Thus, the initial binding of NK-CIA is sufficient to determine inhibition of
proliferation of precursor cells. However, inhibition of early CFU-GM was still
observed when the NK-CIA was added at up to the 6th d of culture. After day
7, no inhibition could be induced by NK-CIA, suggesting that GM precursor
cells have matured in vitro to an NK-CIA-resistant stage, possibly analogous to
that of the day 7 late CFU-GM present in the bone marrow. The differential
sensitivity of early and late CFU-GM to NK-CIA does not seem to be only
quantitative, because doses of NK-CIA up to 10-fold higher than those effective
on early CFU-GM were still inactive on late colonies. The possibility remains
that different types of CSF, inducing differentiation along slightly different
myeloid, monocytic, or mixed pathways of differentiation, may affect in different
ways the ability to respond to NK-CIA.
The results reported here, showing that human NK cells and their soluble
products are effective in vitro in controlling hematopoiesis, may be important to
understanding both physiological and pathological conditions in which alterations
of the hematopoietic system are observed. The data support the hypothesis that
the NK cell subset, which in normal donors constitutes ~15% of the total
peripheral blood mononuclear cell population, plays a primary role in the
homeostasis of the hematopoietic system.
Summary
Incubation of human peripheral blood iymphocytes with bone marrow cells
resulted in significant inhibition of colony formation by committed myeloid and
erythroid cells. Using positively selected homogeneous natural killer (NK) cell
preparations and lymphocyte subpopulations depleted of or enriched for NK
cells, we definitively characterize as NK cells the cells in normal peripheral blood
that are responsible for inhibition of bone marrow colony growth. The inhibitory
effect of NK cells on hematopoiesis can be mediated by a soluble factor that is
produced only by NK cells upon culture with HLA-DR+ hematopoietic cells and
with NK-sensitive cell lines. Both NK cells and the NK-produced, colony-inhibit-
ing activity (NK-CIA) are suppressive for allogeneic and autologous bone marrow
CFU-GEMM (colony-forming units, granuiocyte, e(ythroid, monocyte, mega-
karyocyte), CFU-E (CFU, erythroid), and early CFU-GM (CFU, granulocyte,
monocyte), but not for either BFU-E (burst-forming units, erythroid) or late
CFU-GM. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was inhibited by NK-CIA-containing
supernatants in HLA-DR + but not HLA-DR- bone marrow cell populations
stimulated to proliferative by colony-stimulating factor (CSF). These data suggest
that the NK cell-mediated inhibitory effect on proliferation and differentiation
1166 INHIBITION OF HEMOPOIETIC COLONIES BY NK CELLS
of hematopoietic precursor cells is mediated in part or completely by the secreted
NK-CIA. The concentration of NK-CIA reached in the supernatant of the
mixture of NK cell-containing lymphocyte populations with bone marrow cells
is sufficient to account for the inhibitory effect mediated by NK cells. Our data
support the hypothesis that human NK cells play a major role in the control of
hematopoiesis, down-regulating it under conditions in which the NK cells are
functionally activated.
