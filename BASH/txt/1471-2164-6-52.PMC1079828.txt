Abstract
Background: Quantitative trait locus (QTL) theory predicts that genetic influence on complex
traits involves multiple genes of small effect size. To detect QTL associations of small effect size,
large samples and systematic screens of thousands of DNA markers are required. An efficient
solution is to genotype case and control DNA pools using SNP microarrays. We demonstrate that
this is practical using DNA pools of 100 individuals.
Results: Using standard microarray protocols for the Affymetrix GeneChip® Mapping 10 K Array
Xba 131, we show that relative allele signal (RAS) values provide a quantitative index of allele
frequencies in pooled DNA that correlate 0.986 with allele frequencies for 104 SNPs that were
genotyped individually for 100 individuals. The sensitivity of the assay was demonstrated empirically
in a spiking experiment in which 15% and 20% of one individual's DNA was added to a DNA pool.
Conclusion: We conclude that this approach, which we call SNP-MaP (SNP microarrays and
pooling), is rapid, cost effective and promises to be a valuable initial screening method in the hunt
for QTLs.
Background
The success of linkage mapping in Mendelian traits led to
great optimism that the same approach could be har-
nessed to identify genes in disorders or traits without clear
Mendelian inheritance patterns, so called complex or
quantitative traits. In contrast to phenotypes that are con-
trolled by single genes, in complex traits there is no clear-
cut mode of transmission. It is likely that quantitative
traits are influenced by many genes of small effect size
(called quantitative trait loci, QTLs), with factors such as
gene-gene interactions (epistasis), pleiotropy, and gene-
environment interactions complicating matters further
[1,2].
Although many linkage screens for complex disorders
have been reported, linkage studies are underpowered to
detect genes of small effect size [3]. In contrast, case-con-
trol association analysis, even using stringent significance

levels, promises to provide the power required to detect
QTLs that are too weak to be detected by linkage analysis
alone [2]. However, this power comes at an expense, as a
systematic genome wide association study requires very
large numbers of DNA markers, perhaps as many as
500,000 [4,5]. Furthermore, the ability to detect QTLs of
small effect size requires large samples. For example, 80%
power (p < .01, two tailed) to detect an effect of 0.5% in
an unselected sample requires samples of at least 1000
individuals [6].
Consequently, considerable effort has gone into develop-
ing high-throughput genotyping methodologies that
allow the genotyping of dense marker sets in large sample
sizes quickly, accurately, with minimal optimisation and
very low unit cost [7]. Until such technologies become
widely available, one way to address the cost, time and
labour involved in using large sample sizes is to perform
analyses not on individual DNA samples, but on pools
made up of DNA from multiple individuals for cases and
for controls, a technique that can dramatically reduce the
genotyping burden [8]. There is a growing literature
addressing methodological issues such as DNA pool con-
struction, genotyping assays, and statistical analysis [9-
12], and the strengths and weaknesses of DNA pooling
have recently been reviewed [13]. DNA pooling has been
used successfully to identify replicated associations with
complex traits [14-16]. However, using the current SNP
genotyping methodologies on DNA pools even for a small
number of DNA pools for a dense marker set is still
labour-intensive and expensive. One solution to the prob-
lem of genotyping many DNA markers is SNP genotyping
microarrays which use a one-primer assay to genotype
thousands of SNPs, offering the first real hope of a system-
atic survey of DNA variation in the human genome. How-
ever, microarrays can be used only once and are expensive
in studies consisting of the large samples needed to detect
QTLs of small effect size. One solution to the QTL conun-
drum is to combine both DNA pooling and SNP microar-
rays, an approach that we call SNP-MaP (SNP microarrays
and pooling), which can dramatically reduce the cost of
screening large numbers of SNPs on large samples.
We hypothesised that quantitative estimates of allele fre-
quencies – especially the relative allele frequencies com-
paring groups like cases and controls – can be derived
from pooled DNA using SNP genotyping microarrays,
similar to the way that expression microarrays estimate
quantitative frequencies for mRNA transcripts [17].
Affymetrix software (GDAS) uses the hybridisation fluo-
rescence signals from the SNP microarrays to generate
'Relative Allele Signals' (RAS), a ratio of the measurement
of allele A to the summed measurement of alleles A and B.
Thus, RAS values vary between 0.0 and 1.0. Two inde-
pendent RAS values are derived for each SNP from the
sense strand (RAS1) and the anti-sense strand (RAS2). As
explained in the Methods, Affymetrix software plots RAS1
scores against RAS2 scores and uses empirically derived
clustering information to trichotomise these RAS scores as
genotypes for DNA of an individual. RAS values near 0.0
are identified as a BB homozygote, 0.5 as an AB heterozy-
gote, and 1.0 as an AA homozygote. We propose that RAS
values can be used as quantitative indexes of allele fre-
quencies in DNA pools.
The purpose of our current report is to follow up our pre-
vious study that addressed the feasibility of SNP-MaP
[18]. We explore the reliability validity and sensitivity of
SNP-MaP in greater detail using Affymetrix GeneChip®
Mapping 10 K Array Xba 131 which genotypes more than
10,000 SNPs.
We constructed a control DNA pool consisting of 100
individuals independently three times (control pool A, B,
and C), each assayed on triplicate microarrays. We used
these replicate control pools to assess the reliability of esti-
mating allele frequencies from pooled DNA. To assess
validity and sensitivity, we compared allele frequency esti-
mates from microarray assays using pooled DNA to indi-
vidual genotyping. In addition, in order to assess
sensitivity experimentally, we reconstructed two 'case'
DNA pools that differed by 15% and 20% in allele fre-
quencies from the controls by spiking an aliquot of a con-
trol pool with an individual's DNA who was also
individually genotyped on the microarray. Each case pool
was assayed on duplicate microarrays.
Results
Validation of pool construction
Before using the microarrays, we genotyped the 9 DNA
pools for 3 SNPs using SNaPshot™ ddNTP primer exten-
sion reaction kit (Applied Biosystems©) in order to con-
firm that the control DNA pools A, B and C were
representative of the 100 individuals used to construct the
pools. The results indicated that pool construction was
valid in that, for the three SNPs, the pools yielded similar
allele frequency estimates. Most importantly, these esti-
mates, and especially their averages across the pools, are
highly similar to the allele frequencies based on individ-
ual genotyping. For example, the average pooled allele fre-
quencies (corrected for k see below and Methods) and
individual genotyping allele frequencies, respectively,
were 0.914 and 0.918 for rs1003063, 0.438 and 0.464 for
rs15643193, and 0.639 and 0.634 for rs956122. SNaP-
shot™ has previously been shown to estimate pool allele
frequencies with a high degree of accuracy if k is applied
[12].

Summary of 10 K GeneChip results for pooled DNA
We consistently obtained good signal detection rates
across all 14 microarrays used in the study, with an aver-
age signal detection of 83.9% (range of 60.54% to
98.59%) using the default analysis parameters. SNPs were
excluded if there was inadequate discrimination between
specific versus non-specific hybridisation of DNA to the
probes.
We obtained RAS1 and RAS2 values for 6077 SNPs across
all 9 microarrays for the control pools A, B and C. For the
spiked pools, RAS1 and RAS2 values were obtained for
9908 SNPs for the 15% spiked pool and 6668 SNPs for
the 20% spiked pools.
Validation: comparing allele frequencies from pooled DNA
and population estimates
We have previously shown that an average of RAS1 and
RAS2 values (RASav) estimate pooled allele frequencies
more accurately then RAS1 or RAS2 alone [18].
RASav values were calculated for each SNP on the 3 micro-
arrays for each of the 3 DNA control pools. These RASav
values were then averaged across the 9 microarrays. The
resulting allelic frequency estimates from pooled DNA
were correlated with SNP allele frequencies determined by
individually genotyping for an independent Caucasian
sample. The latter data are publicly available from the
NetAffx™ Analysis Centre https://www.affymetrix.com/
analysis/netaffx/index.affx, a web-based tool providing
extensive annotation for each SNP on the 10 k microarray
derived from Affymetrix internal validation studies.
Figure 1a shows a scatterplot between the RASav estimates
of allele frequencies for pooled DNA versus the allele fre-
quency estimates from individual genotyping for 11,533
SNPs. The correlation between the pooled DNA and indi-
vidual genotyping estimates is 0.901, indicating that RAS
values can be used to provide a valid quantitative measure
of allele frequency in pooled DNA. Nonetheless, the abso-
lute mean difference between microarray estimates of
pooled allele frequencies and NetAffx™ population allele
frequencies was 0.094 but varies widely (Min 0.00, Max
0.619).
In Figure 1a, the allele frequency estimates from pooled
DNA were not corrected for unequal amplification of the
two alleles that can occur with pooled DNA. That is, when
two alleles are present in equal amounts (as in hetero-
zygous individuals), the allele measurements obtained
should be of equal size or intensity. However, for to
various reasons [19] equal representation of alleles may
not occur.

This bias is corrected by applying a factor, k [20], where k
= A/B, using the equation: A = A/(A+kB), where A and B
are the measurements of the A and B alleles. k corrections
for the SNPs on the Affymetrix 10 K microarray were avail-
able from a panel of 33 Caucasian individuals assayed on
separate microarrays and applied to each SNP (see
Methods).
The range of k values is very tight, with only a handful of
outliers considering the enormous number of SNPs under
investigation. 6,813 of 10,084 SNPs have k values ranging
from 0.5 to 1.5 (we would expect k to be 1 if both alleles
were being measured equally). The averaged k over
10,088 SNPs is 1.14, median = 0.94, max = 93, min = 0.0.
It should be noted that in relation to a case-control study
design, unless k is extreme and allele frequencies rare, k
correction would not significantly impact on relative allele
frequency differences between cases and controls,
although absolute allele frequency estimates would alter.
In other words, although k correction is needed to com-
pare allelic frequency estimates from pooled DNA and
individual genotyping, it is not needed for comparisons
between cases and controls.
Figure 1b shows the tighter scatter around the line of best
fit when the pooled estimates are k-corrected. The correla-
tion between the pooled and individual genotyping esti-
mates increased from 0.901 to 0.953. The mean difference
between k-corrected microarray estimates and NetAffx™ is
also attenuated from .094 to .064.
Validation: comparing allele frequencies for pooled DNA
and individual genotyping
In addition to using the NetAffx™ population data, we
individually genotyped the 100 individuals used to con-
struct the control pool for 104 SNPs. The results are
shown in Figure 2. As expected, the 104 SNP allele fre-
quencies generated by the micorarrays are highly corre-
lated (0.924) with the NetAffx™ population data, and
correlate even better with the individual genotyping data
for individuals in the pool (0.942). The mean difference
between microarray estimates and individual genotyping
was .077. When k correction was applied, the correlation
between k-corrected microarray estimates and individual
genotyping increased to 0.986, and the mean difference
between k-corrected microarray estimates was attenuated
from .077 to .036.
Estimation of experimental errors
The previous analyses are based on RASav values averaged
across the 9 microarrays. In order to assess the technical
reliability of deriving allele frequency estimates from the
DNA pools, we compared RASav for the three technical
replicates within each DNA pool and between the three
DNA pools. (See Figure 3.) As expected given the high cor-
relation between pooled estimates and individual geno-
typing, correlations of RASav values within pool triplicates
are very high (0.945 to 0.968), as are correlations between
pools (0.94 to 0.982). The dispersion of the RASav values
cross the nine control microarrays is encouragingly nar-
row: all but 19 SEMs are under 0.1 and 8,695 are 0.025 or
less.
For those SNPs where we have RAS values across all 9
pools (n = 6077), the median standard deviation is .042.
Using this figure to estimate the power of a hypothetical
experiment where we have the same number of case
pools, for a .05 significance level we would have 80%
power to detect an allelic frequency difference of 0.05, and
virtual certainty of detecting an allelic frequency differ-
ence of 0.10.
By fitting a random intercept model for each SNP to the 9
RASav values, it is possible to estimate the variance compo-
nents attributable to pool construction (τ) and the meas-
urement error (σ). σ and τ are assumed to be
independently normally distributed. The distribution of
is quite similar to the overall standard deviation (see
figure 3) because tau is, as expected, quite small, ranging
from 9 × 10-7 to 2 × 10-4, with a median of 3 × 10-5. An esti-
mate of 1 × 10-4 has been made from comparable pools
using different methods [21].

Sensitivity
The sensitivity of SNP-MaP was assessed empirically in a
spiking experiment in which 15% and 20% of one indi-
vidual's DNA was added to control pool D to create two
new pools analogous to 'case' pools. Each of the spiked
pools was assessed on duplicate microarrays. The
individual's DNA was also genotyped on a microarray in
order to calculate the allelic frequencies of the spiked
pools.
Based on the power calculations presented above, in this
spiking experiment we would expect to have roughly 52%
power to detect allelic frequency differences of 0.10
between the control and spiked pools. This is less than the
power estimate from the control DNA pools because here
we have only two replicates of each spiked pool, and nine
replicates of the control pool, which is equivalent to hav-
ing equal groups of n = 3.27 (the harmonic mean of 9 and
2). The expected differences in the spiked pool are
dependent upon the original allele frequencies in the con-
trol pool because we used a fixed total amount of (i.e. the
amount of pool DNA is reduced to make room for the
spike DNA). For the SNPs where the expected allele fre-
quency difference in the 15% and 20% spiked pools was
more than 0.10 and we had complete data (n = 658), a sig-
nificant t-test difference was observed for 379 SNPs
(58%), supporting our predicted power calculations. As
shown in Table 2, the observed and predicted differences
between spiked ('case') and control correspond well on
average over the entire frequency range, although the pre-
dicted allele frequency differences are greater than the
observed differences. The expected allele frequencies are
calculated from frequencies measured in the control
pools, and are greatest for low frequency alleles, some of
which appear low by chance due to measurement error.
The apparent bias shown in table 2 is thus due to regres-
sion to the mean.
Discussion
We have demonstrated that the SNP-MaP method can
tackle the QTL problem of large samples and large num-
bers of SNPs. Specifically, allele frequencies can be accu-
rately estimated from pooled DNA allelotyped on
microarrays using the sophisticated allele-specific hybrid-
isation method packaged in the commercially available
Affymetrix GeneChip® system. The validity and sensitivity
of the SNP-MaP method was shown by the correlation of
0.986 between estimates of allele frequency from pooled
DNA and individual genotyping. The sensitivity 'spiking'
experiment confirmed these estimates, suggesting that
case-control pool allele frequency differences on the order
of 0.10 could be detected above the noise of measurement
error using this method. With this level of sensitivity, the
SNP-MaP approach should be able to detect QTLs of mod-
est effect size if large samples are used. The benefit of DNA
pooling is that large samples cost no more to genotype
than small samples.
These results make it reasonable to proceed to case-con-
trol studies of complex traits. For example, we are using
the SNP-MaP method in a large-scale study of children of
low versus high reading ability. In an actual association
study, sampling variation is added to the parameters con-
sidered in the present study which focused on technical
replicates within and between DNA pools of the same
group of individuals and compared allele frequency esti-
mates for pooled DNA from this group of individuals to
individual genotyping. However, in an actual association
study, pooled DNA estimates are not compared within
and between pools of the same individuals but rather
between different pools consisting of different individu-
als. For this reason, in an actual association study, sam-
pling variation would be considered and could be
estimated parametrically by including in the design sub-
pools of independent samples of cases and controls. This
would permit the use of standard parametric statistics
comparing the mean allelic frequencies of cases and con-
trols in which N is the number of subpools. In addition,
using at least two microarrays on each subpool would
alleviate technical variation between microarrays and sub-
pools. It should be emphasised that DNA pooling is best

construed as nominating SNPs that are then confirmed
with individual genotyping.
We have used the quantitative RAS values, designed to
produce a robust allele call when assessed for individuals,
to estimate allele frequencies for pooled DNA. It is likely
that a more elegant way can be found to derive an allele
frequency estimate from the 40 oligonucleotide probes
present for each SNP (20 matches and 20 mis-matches).
For example, it has been reported in a study of gene
expression differences that increased power can be
obtained by testing for differences for each probe rather
than for differences averaged over the entire probe set
level [22].
The tests used here were not corrected for multiple testing
because the intent is to use this method not as a definitive
analysis, but rather as a rapid initial screen to reduce the
number of candidate SNPs to be submitted to individual
genotyping for the large samples needed to detect QTLs of
small effect size. With 10,000 SNPs, a large number of
false positive results are expected by chance and so we rec-
ommend using a multi-stage replication design in order to
balance false positives and false negatives in the selection
of SNPs for individual genotyping [13].
Our analyses of SNP-MaP were based on the 10,000 SNP
microarray, but should also be applicable to the 100 k
Affymetrix GeneChip® system launched in June 2004 and
the 500 k Affymetrix GeneChip® system scheduled for the
end of 2005. Although the SNPs on the Affymetrix arrays
are chosen on the basis of coverage of the whole genome
(not on the basis of functionality or location in or near
coding regions), 500,000 SNPS approaches a comprehen-
sive genome scan for association based on linkage
disequilibrium. The SNP-MaP approach will also be rele-
vant to other types of SNP microarrays such as a microar-
ray that emerges from the exon re-sequencing project at
the Sanger Centre which aims to identify all nonsynony-
mous (nsSNPs), which are likely to be functional because
the polymorphism involves an amino acid difference in
translation. Microarrays with functional SNPs will facili-
tate direct association analyses with increased power as
compared to indirect association analyses based on link-
age disequilibrium [23].
Conclusion
In summary, we have shown that the SNP-MaP method is
a reliable and powerful approach to screen thousands of
loci using large sample sizes. Employing case-control
designs using SNP-MaP will speed-up the SNP nomina-
tion process for individual genotyping, and thus help
detect SNPs of small effect size more efficiently.
Methods
Samples
The sample consisted of 100 Caucasian individuals (51
females and 49 males) randomly selected from an ongo-
ing study of cognitive ability that is described elsewhere
[24].
DNA quantification and pool construction
DNA samples were quantified using a spectrophotometer
(260 nm), and diluted in Te buffer (0.1 mM EDTA, 10
mM Tris HCL, pH 8.0) to a target concentration of 100 ng/
µl, before being quantified using fluorimetry (Picogreen®
dsDNA quantitation reagent Cambridge Bioscience, U.K)
and diluted further to a target concentration of 50 ng/µl (±
5%). Pools were constructed independently in triplicate
by combining 50 ng of DNA from each individual, pro-
ducing a final pool concentration of 35.5 ng/µl.
An aliquot of control pool D was reconstructed to form
artificial 'case' pools by replacing 15 and 20% of the pool
sample with the same quantity of DNA of one genotyped
individual (the spike). This changes the quantities of alle-
les present in a way that depends on their frequency in the
pool and the genotype of the spike.
Validation of pool construction
Three SNPs chosen from the microarray set were geno-
typed independently in duplicate on the three replicate
control DNA pools, A, B and C using SNaPshot™, a com-
mercially available dideoxynucleotide primer extension
kit (PE applied biosystems). Electrophoresis of the sam-
ples was performed on an ABI Prism® 3100 genetic ana-
lyser, analysed with Genotyper® 3.7, and the allele
frequencies derived from peak heights.
The correction factor, k, was calculated by individually
genotyping seven known heterozygous individuals using
the SNaPshot™ method for each of the three SNPs. The
pooled allele frequency estimates were then corrected
using the equation A = A/(A+kB), where A and B are the
peak heights of alleles A and B respectively.
Individual genotyping
104 randomly chosen SNPs from the microarray were
genotyped in the 100 individuals that were used to con-
struct the DNA control pool. The individual genotyping
was outsourced to Kbiosciences, who use a mixture of
competitive allele specific PCR (KASPar) and TaqMan
genotyping assays http://www.kbioscience.co.uk/.
Genotyping DNA pools on the microarray
The individual spike DNA and 13 pooled DNA samples
were genotyped using Affymetrix GeneChip® Mapping 10
K Array Xba 131. Standard procedures and default analy-
sis parameters for individual DNA samples were

employed, and each assay was independently amplified
before hybridization. The scans were performed using
GCOS V1.0 and the images (cel.files) were analyzed using
GDAS V2.0.
Derivation of allele frequencies from pooled DNA
The Affymetrix microarray uses a probe quartet as the
basic unit for detecting different genotypes with a DNA
sample. Each probe quartet consists of a perfect match
(PM) and a mis-match (MM) probe for alleles A and B on
both the sense and anti-sense strands. To make the geno-
typing more reliable, 7 probe quartets are used, with the
polymorphic nucleotide having different shifts from the
center of the 25-mer probe sequence. The best five quar-
tets are used to create 40 hybridization intensity values.
A detection filter automatically blocks weak or unreliable
signals by comparing the discrimination between perfect
match and mis-match cells using the formula (PM-MM)/
(PM + MM). Feature extraction processes the intensity val-
ues for all SNPs that pass the pre-determined discrimina-
tion threshold.
In feature extraction, PM probes for the sense strand of
allele A (PMA) are corrected for the noise of non-specific
hybridisation by averaging the mis-match values of both
alleles (A and B) on the sense strand [(MMA + MMB)/2]
and subtracting this from the PMA value. This procedure
for correcting the sense strand of allele A is repeated for
the anti-sense strand of allele A, the sense strand of allele
B and the anti-sense strand of allele B, resulting in four rel-
ative intensity values.
Relative allele signals (RAS) are then calculated for the
sense (RAS1) and anti-sense strands (RAS2) using the
formula [PMA/ (PMA + PMB)]. This is done for each of the
five quartets for each SNP and the median RAS1 and
median RAS2 value is used to identify genotypes for indi-
vidual DNA [25]. Plotting RAS1 scores against RAS2
scores, a clustering algorithm is used to determine indi-
vidual genotypes. That is, if the two RAS values cluster
near 0.0, they are identified as a BB homozygote; 0.5 for
an AB heterozygote, and 1.0 for an AA homozygote.
Affymetrix software (GDAS) incorporates empirically
derived boundaries for each genotype's cluster, which is
used to indicate genotypes; RAS scores falling outside
these cluster boundaries are not assigned genotypes. For
pooled DNA, we used only the detection filter, feature
extraction processes, and RAS scores, disregarding the
automated genotype calls. We used the average of the
sense (RAS1) and anti-sense RAS2; RASav as an estimate of
allele frequency in the DNA pools.
As mentioned, a correction factor, k, is used to improve
the accuracy of allele frequency estimates from pooled
DNA. k was empirically derived from a panel of 33 indi-
viduals assayed on microarrays. k was calculated for each
strand by dividing the mean of allele A (RAS1 or RAS2) by
the mean of allele B (1 minus allele A). The mean of RAS1
and RAS2 was calculated by averaging a set of RAS1 and
RAS2 scores from a panel of between 1 and 33 hetero-
zygous individuals. In total, we obtained an estimate of k
for 10,084 SNPs. Derivation and implementation of k in
correcting pooled DNA estimates of allele frequency using
microarrays are described in detail elsewhere [26].
Authors' contributions
EM and LB constructed the DNA pools, performed the
microarray assays (with assistance from LL and CF), statis-
tical analysis (with LS), and drafted the manuscript (with
LS). AC and VH performed the assays used to estimate k.
RP, IC, LS and CF conceived and designed the study. All
authors read and approved the final manuscript.

Table 1: Predicted and observed allele frequency differences.
The predicted allele frequency differences are the differences we
would expect to see based on the allele frequency estimates
from the control pools and the genotype of the spiker. The
observed allele frequency differences are the actual frequencies
observed in the spiked pool as compared to the control pools.
Number of SNPs range between 459 and 2621.
