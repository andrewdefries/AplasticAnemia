Pruritus ani is an unpleasant cutaneous sensation that induces the desire to scratch the skin around the anal orifice. It may
start insidiously and appears in 1% to 5% of the population. It is classified as primary (idiopathic) pruritus ani when no
cause can be found. However, as 25% to 75% of cases have co-existing pathology, a detailed history and examination are
necessary. The goal of treatment is asymptomatic, intact, dry, clean perianal skin with reversal of morphological changes.
The management of pruritus ani is directed towards the underlying cause. If the diagnosis is idiopathic pruritus ani, the
patients can still be managed with great success by eliminating of irritants and scratching, by giving general advice regard-
ing hygiene and lifestyle modification and by using active treatment measures.
Keywords: Idiopathic pruritus ani; Active treatment measures
Secondary pruritus ani is diagnosed when an underlying cause can
be identified and treatment leads to an improvement in the pruri-
tus ani [4].
There exists a long list of specific disease entities that may cause
pruritus ani, and these are usually categorized into infectious and
non-infectious causes. The most prevalent anorectal diseases re-
lated with pruritus ani are hemorrhoids and anal fissures; others
are anal fistulas, abscesses, proctitis, rectal cancer, adenomatous
polyps, etc. Skin disorders as etiologic factor are contact dermatitis,
lichen planus, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, vitiligo, squamous
cell carcinomas, Paget’s disease, etc. Infectious disease, such as in-
fections due to bacteria and fungus, should not be overlooked [5].
Fungal infections have been reported to account for up to 15% of
the underlying causes of pruritus ani, and other infections, such
as those due to viruses, parasites (pinworms), etc., are also causes
of pruritus ani. Medications, such as tetracycline, colchcine, quin-
idine, local anesthetics, neomycin, etc., and systemic diseases, such
as diabetes, lymphoma, obstructive jaundice, thyroid dysfunction,
leukemia, chronic renal failure, and aplastic anemia, are considered
as causative factors. Some studies have reported that pruritus ani
was reduced within 2 weeks after avoiding specific foods, such as
tomatoes, chocolate, citric fruits, spices, coffee (including both caf-
feinated and decaffeinated), tea, cola, beer, milk and other dairy
products [4, 6, 7]. Psychological factors, such as anxiety, agitation,
and stress, may also cause pruritus ani [8]. Others are fecal incon-
tinence, excessive humidity, the use of soap, excess scrubbing of
the anus, chronic diarrhea, and menopause (Table 1).
The pathophysiology of pruritus ani has not been elucidated yet.
It has been hypothesized that when sensory nerves in the perianal
INTRODUCTION
Pruritus ani is an unpleasant cutaneous sensation, and its symp-
toms are characterized by varying degrees of itching around the
anal orifice [1]. Pruritus ani is a common proctological problem,
and many physicians believe that it reflects hemorrhoidal disease.
The exact incidence worldwide is unknown, but men are affected
more often than women by a ratio of 4:1. Most patients are dis-
tributed in the 30-70 age group and it is particularly prevalent in
the 40-60 age group [2, 3]. This article addresses the etiology of
pruritus ani, its underlying disease, and current medical treatments
for pruritus ani.
ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Pruritus ani may have various causes, and it has been divided into
two subtypes: idiopathic and secondary. Idiopathic pruritus ani
accounts for 25-75% of pruritus ani cases depending on investiga-
tors, and it is diagnosed in cases in which no etiology can be found.

area are stimulated, skin irritation and subsequent pruritis is in-
duced; consequently, the skin is excessively scratched, which causes
skin injury. Fecal contamination due to abnormal transient inter-
nal sphincter relaxation has also been reported to result in a sub-
sequent perianal itching problem. Feces contain endopeptidases
of bacterial origin, in addition to potential allergens and bacteria.
These enzymes are capable of causing both itching and inflamma-
tion.
SYMPTOMS AND PHYSICAL FINDINGS
The main symptom of pruritus ani is the untolerable impulse to
scratch the perianal area. Although that symptom can occur at any
time, it is most common following a bowel movement, especially
after liquid stools, and at bedtime, just before falling asleep. Some
patients also experience intense itching during the night. As the
area of involvement spreads and the intensity of itching increases,
the patients reflexively begin scratching and clawing at the skin.
This leads to further skin damage, excoriation, and potentially a
secondary skin infection.
Gordon classified pruritus ani into three clinical stages accord-
ing to the skin condition. In stage 0, the skin appears normal. In
stage 1, the skin is red and inflamed. In stage 2, the patient presents
with white lichenified skin. In stage 3, the patient presents with li-
chenified skin, as well as coarse ridges of skin and often ulcerations
secondary to scratching. The skin lesions of pruritus ani caused
by food often have symmetric shapes.
A carefully taken history can often aid in identifying the cause of
pruritus. This history should include any change in bowel habit and
details of any other previous or current dermatological or gastro-
intestinal problems. Clinicians should ask patients about the onset
of symptoms and the relationship of the onset to diet, medication
and anal hygiene practices. Pruritus ani can be caused by infesta-
tion with enterobius vermicularis, or pinworms, especially in chil-
dren. The worms emerge from the anal canal at night and early
morning; thus, pruritus is worst at those times. Sticky-tape tests
should be performed for identifying the eggs or adult worms mi-
croscopically. Pruritus ani may develop due to gynecological causes
in female patients; thus, pruritus on the perineal region caused by
vaginal discharge or urinary incontinence should be considered.
Infectious diseases, such as cervicitis, trichomoniasis and candidi-
asis, should be considered. Although rare, for postmenopausal
women showing atrophic vaginitis findings, together with hot
flushes due to hormonal changes, symptoms may be ameliorated
by hormone replacement therapy.
At the visual inspection, maceration, erythema, desquamation
or lichenification of the skin may be observed, and to assess the
secondary causes of pruritus, which can be inferred from abnor-
malities of the sphincter and from the history of disease, digital rec-
tal examination and anoscopic examination should be performed.
Gayle et al. reported that the risk of harboring a neoplastic lesion
was significantly related to the duration of symptoms and to an age
greater than 50 years. They concluded that pruritus ani was fre-
quently a symptom attributable to other colonic and anorectal pa-
thologies. Thus, the presence of prutitus ani of long duration, which
is refractory to medical treatment, should alert the physician to
the possibility of underlying colonic or anorectal neoplastic pa-
thologies. Colonoscopy and other aggressive modalities involving
the lower gastrointestinal tract are required [6]. If pruritus ani that
does not respond to two to three weeks of conservative treatment,
efforts should be made to find underlying diseases that may have
been easily overlooked. This can be done by aggressively perform-
ing a biopsy on the area that is thought to be most appropriate for
rendering a clinical diagnosis.
TREATMENT
Treatment should be directed toward finding the underlying dis-
eases. Most patients with secondary pruritus ani are improved af-
ter correction of the causative agent. For patients who are thought

Pruritus Ani

be suffering from idiopathic pruritus ani whose causative cannot
be found, life style modification should be suggested (Table 2). Gen-
erally, the perianal skin should be maintained dry and clean and
have weak acidity. Particularly, patients should be educated to clean
the perianal area with water after defecation and to avoid severe
rubbing. The anus should be dried with a hair dryer or carefully
tapped with cottons swabs [9]. When a bidet is used, it is better to
use warm water and relatively low water pressure to avoid irrita-
tion of the anus [10]. In regard to clothes, it is recommended to
avoid underwear that cannot absorb sweat well and to wear loose
cotton underwear [7, 9]. The use of topical steroids, anti-histamine
agents, and sedatives may be of help. However, topical corticoste-
roids, especially if used for a long period, can cause atrophy, bac-
terial and fungal infections, allergic contact dermatitis, telangiec-
tasia, purpura, and/or scar formation. Thus, their long-term use
should be avoided. In addition, if constipation or defecation dis-
order is present, appropriate laxatives, as well as a high-fiber diet,
may be of help.
Psyllium agents are of help in reducing the injury to the anal ca-
nal and in maintaining better hygiene of the perianal area. In ad-
dition, it is important to educate patients to avoid foods and drinks
that exacerbate itching. As mentioned above, coffee, tea, cola, choc-
olate, and beer are considered to be causes of pruritus. In regard
to coffee, Friend [7] have stated that coffee is associated with the
induction of pruritus ani and that one hour after coffee consump-
tion, the resting anal pressure is decreased [4, 11]. However, gen-
erally, the direct association of coffee with the induction of pruritus
is not clear, and more accurate studies are required. Generally,
many cases of pruritus ani can be treated readily by improving di-
etary habits, correcting bowel habits, and avoiding certain mechan-
ical or chemical irritations.
For patients with persistent and severe pruritus that cannot be
treated by general conservative methods, aggressive therapies have
been attempted. For mild and moderate levels of pruritus ani in
which skin discoloration in the perianal area is not severe, topical
ointments, such as 1% hydrocortisone, can be applied [2, 3]. How-
ever, once the symptoms have improved, steroid use should be dis-
continued, if possible, and replaced with other barrier creams, such
as zinc oxide, and the side effects caused by the indiscriminate use
of steroid cream should be explained sufficiently to the patient by
the primary doctor. For severe pruritus ani cases with severe skin
discoloration of the perianal area, a strong steroid must be used
for a short time, but topical treatments that are longer than several
weeks are not generally recommended. Until now, a clear criterion
for the duration of steroid use has not been established. Al-Gh-
naniem et al. [12] reported that 1% hydrocortisone application for
the treatment of pruritus ani resulted in a 68% improvement in
symptoms compared to the placebo group. Although some inves-
tigators have stated that the local immune suppressor tacrolimus
might be of help in preventing skin atrophy and anti-fungal effects,
such data have not yet been reported [13].
Lysy et al. [14] reported that 0.006% topical capsaicin ointment
was applied to 44 patients with incurable pruritus ani that was un-
responsive to menthol treatments three times a day and that 31
patients showed an improvement of symptoms. Capsaicin is a nat-
ural alkaloid extracted from red chili peppers. Its pharmacological
action is mainly depletion of substance P (neuropeptide) from sen-
sory neurons. Generally, it has been used as a treatment for rheu-
matoid arthritis and neuralgia. Capsaicin causes a mild perianal
burning sensation, but a concentration of 0.006% capsaicin rather
than 1% or 0.5% is effective in alleviating pruritus ani without the
significant burning sensation associated with more concentrated
preparations. In the future, the topical application of capsaicin may
be of help in treating pruritus ani, if the side effects of the long-term
use of steroids or cases unresponsive to other topical therapies are
considered.
Since the intradermal injection of methylene blue for the treat-
ment of refractory pruritus ani was introduced by Rygick in 1968,
diverse treatments have been attempted [15]. The mechanism of
methylene blue’s exerting therapeutic effects on pruritus ani has
not been elucidated yet. Methylene blue may be directly toxic to
the nerves supplying the perianal skin, thus suppressing the desire
to scratch and disrupting the vicious itch-scratch-itch cycle [16].
According to studies that have been reported until now, good out-
comes have been reported in 64% to 100% of the patients treated
with methylene blue. Recently, some investigators stated that in-
tradermal injection of 0.5-1.0% methylene blue mixed with lido-
caine and a steroid had good outcomes for the treatment of intrac-
table pruritus ani [17, 18]. Although there have been some reports
on complications after tattooing, such as decreased perianal sen-
Table 2. Instructions for patients
During bath or shower, wash the outside of the anal area with water. Do not use soap or salt in the anal area.
Avoid abrasive trauma or vigorous rubbing by patting the skin dry with a soft towel or by using a hair dryer at low heat.
During the day and bedtime, it may be helpful to apply a thin cotton pledget directly into the anal crease.
Avoid use of toilet paper.
A warm sitz bath for 5 minutes two to three times a day is recommended.
Maintain a soft, large and nonirritating stool by eating a high fiber diet. Use a bulking agent if not constipated.
Avoid foods that cause bowel irritation and that induce itching.
Wear loose underwear.

sation, transient fecal incontinence and local inflammatory reac-
tions in the injection area, it was well tolerated by the patients and
resulted in no severe complications [19]. Therefore, it can be used
to treat incurable pruritus ani [20].
CONCLUSION
Pruritus ani may manifest in response to various causes, particu-
larly, dermal lesions, or diverse conditions of the anorectum. Hence,
in outpatient clinics, attempts should aggressively be made to find
its causes. Ultimately, it should be adjusted to the improvement of
the symptoms and the consequent secondary skin discoloration.
If the cause cannot be determined despite such efforts, the pruri-
tus ani should be considered as idiopathic and management of the
condition should focus on reducing the source of irritation, chang-
ing of lifestyle, and improving perianal hygiene [20]. In conclusion,
for obtaining successful results from the treatment of pruritus ani,
first of all, it is better to inform patients of the precise proceeding
of the disease, the treatment strategies, and the possibility of re-
currence, and the disease should be managed continuously.
