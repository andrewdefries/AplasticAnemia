INTRODUCTION: Minor histocompatibility antigen HA-1 (MiHAg-HA-1) disparity between a patient and his or her
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genoidentical donor has been widely associated with an increased risk of graft-
versus-host disease following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of HA-1 disparity on the incidence of both acute and chronic graft-versus-host
disease in Tunisian recipients of hematopoietic stem cells.
METHODS: A total of 60 patients and their 60 respective sibling hematopoietic stem cell donors were enrolled in this
study. All patients prophylactically received cyclosporine A and/or methotrexate for graft-versus-host disease. An
HA-1 genotyping assay was performed with the SSP-PCR method, and HLA-A*0201- and/or HLA-A*0206-positive
samples were identified using the Luminex HLA typing method.
RESULTS: The Luminex HLA typing assay showed that 54 patients were positive for either the HLA-A*0201 or HLA-
A*0206 alleles. Among these cases, six pairs were mismatched for MiHAg-HA-1. Both acute and chronic graft-versus-
host disease occurred in four mismatched patients (Fisher’s p-values were 0.044 and 0.170, respectively). A univariate
logistic regression model analysis showed that only acute graft-versus-host disease may be affected by recipient
MiHAg-HA-1 disparity (p: 0.041, OR: 6.727), while chronic graft-versus-host disease correlates with both age and
recipient/donor sex mismatch (p: 0.014, OR: 8.556 and p: 0.033, OR: 8.664, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Our findings support previously reported data suggesting a significant association between HA-1
disparity and the risk of acute graft-versus-host disease following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

INTRODUCTION
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the major cause of
mortality and morbidity following an allogeneic hemato-
poietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).1–4
This complication has been widely linked to immunoge-
netic causes, such as a disparity between the recipient and
his or her human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genoidentical
donor for certain non-HLA antigens, called minor histo-
compatibility antigens (MiHAgs).2,4–6
These antigens are
endogenously synthesized polymorphic products that can
be recognized by alloreactive T cells only in the context of
major histocompatibility complex molecules (HLA).6–9
The
importance of MiHAgs, encoded by sex-linked or autosomal
loci, in the occurrence of GVHD has been demonstrated
previously.2–4,6
Disparity in a limited number of immunodominant
MiHAgs may be sufficient to cause acute GVHD, but the
available data do not permit definitive conclusions.5,10–16
Donor/recipient disparity for HA-1, the most extensively
studied MiHAg and whose expression is limited to hema-
topoietic cells, was initially correlated with acute GVHD in
studies involving small numbers of patients.5,12–14
In
analyses of larger cohorts, however, this disparity was not
significantly associated with the development of acute
GVHD.17–20
Thus, additional studies in other populations

of the same area of research are needed to confirm the
previous result and define the effect of HA-1 disparity on
GVHD occurrence following HSCT.
The minor histocompatibility antigen HA-1 was initially
identified by a cytotoxic T cells clone that was recovered from
a marrow transplant recipient with GVHD.21
This antigen is a
nonapeptide that is part of a protein encoded by the HMHA1
gene that maps to chromosome 19p13.3.22
This gene has
two allelic versions differing at positions 500 (rs3764653)
and 504 (rs1801284) of the cDNA sequence, resulting in
a single amino acid polymorphism.23
The HMHA1H
allele encodes histidine (HA-1H
) at position 3 of the peptide
(VLHDDLLEA), whereas the HMHA1R
allele encodes
arginine (HA-1R
) at the same position. The HLA-A*0201
and HLA-A*0206 molecules have high affinities for the HA-
1H
peptide, and the generated antigen/MHC complex is
recognized by HA-1-specific cytotoxic T cells.23,24
Unlike this
peptide, the HA-1R
peptide does not generate a detectable
immune response.23
HA-1-positive individuals can be either
homozygous or heterozygous carriers of the HA-1H
peptide.
Thus, an HA-1 mismatch is defined by the presence of the
HA-1H
allele in the host and not the donor.
Tunisia is a small North African country characterized
by a mixed origin and a high rate of consanguinity.25,26
Recently, we performed a population genetic study, focus-
ing on HMHA-1 gene polymorphisms in Tunisians.27
In
this study, we found a noticeable probability that a Tunisian
recipient of HSCs may be positive for HA-1/HLA-A*0201.
Consequently, we examined the effect of HA-1 mismatch on
the occurrence of GVHD. To achieve this purpose, a cohort
of HSC recipients and their HLA-identical siblings was
selected to conduct this retrospective study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
To participate in this study, informed consent was
obtained from all participants and/or their families accord-
ing to a protocol approved by the Ethical Committee for
Scientific and Medical Research of the National Blood
Transfusion Center of Tunis (Tunisia).
Patient selection
Because HA-1 antigen presentation is restricted to the
HLA-A*0201 and HLA-A*0206 molecules, we selected only
HLA-A2-positive samples to perform this study. The cohort
comprised 120 individuals: 60 patients and their 60
respective sibling hematopoietic stem cell donors. All
subjects were Tunisian. The patients underwent HLA-
matched HSCT in the National Bone Marrow Transplan-
tation Centre of Tunis between 2000 and 2009. All patients
prophylactically received cyclosporine A and/or metho-
trexate for GVHD and had grades 0–I or II–IV acute GVHD.
See Table 1 for other clinical characteristics.
DNA samples
EDTA-treated blood samples were collected from all
individuals prior to HSCT. DNA was purified from
peripheral blood leukocytes using a DNA Blood Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Leiden, the Netherlands) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions.
GVHD grading
The diagnosis and grading of acute and chronic GVHD
were defined according to Seattle Transplant Team criteria.28
HA-1 genotyping
HA-1 genotyping was performed using a previously
described allele-specific PCR method.22
This SSP-PCR
method uses two sets of primers: set 1 has a forward
common primer and two allele-specific reverse primers, and
set 2 has a reverse common primer and two allele-specific
forward primers. The allele-specific primers target the
polymorphic region that encodes the HA-1H
or HA-1R
allele. All primers were synthesized as oligonucleotides
(Invitrogen Corporation, CA, USA).
PCR amplification was carried out in a final volume of
10 mL containing 200 mM of each dNTP, 0.2 mM of each
primer (which detects a specific allele), 0.2 mM of control
primers (which detect a sequence from the HGH allele), and
1.5 mM MgCl2 in 2 mL of 56 Green Buffer (Promega Cor-
poration, USA). Each PCR was performed using 150 ng of
genomic DNA and 0.4 units of Taq polymerase (GoTaqTM
DNA Polymerase, Promega Corporation, USA).
The amplification protocol was 94˚C for 5 min followed
by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94˚C for 30 s, annealing at
61˚C for 40 s, and elongation at 72˚C for 30 s; the final
elongation step was 72˚C for 5 min (Gene Amp PCR System
9600, Perkin Elmer, CT, USA). The PCR products were
visualized on agarose gels (1.5%) with UV illumination and
photodocumented (UViTechTM
, Germany).
HLA-A*0201/HLA-A*0206 allele typing
Because HA-1 antigen presentation is restricted to HLA-
A*0201 and HLA-A*0206 molecules, only carriers of these
alleles were selected for the statistical analysis. All patients
and donors were previously typed as HLA-A2-positive using
standard clinical laboratory techniques with serological or
molecular testing methods (One Lambda, USA and Innogenetics,
Belgium). HLA-A*0201 and HLA-A*0206 allele typing was
initially performed with LuminexTM
technology (One Lambda
Corporation, USA) and was confirmed in some cases with the
SSP-PCR method (One Lambda Corporation, USA).
Statistical analysis
The association between HA-1 mismatch and the inci-
dence of either acute or chronic GVHD was evaluated using
Fisher’s exact test. The odds ratios for univariate and

multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze
the correlations between risk factors and the probabilities of
acute and chronic GVHD. All statistical analyses were
performed with SPSS software (v. 17.0).
RESULTS
Among 60 HLA-A2-positive patient/donor pairs, the
LuminexTM
molecular genotyping assay showed that
53 cases were positive for the HLA-A*0201 allele, and 1 pair
carried the HLA-A*0206 variant. The remaining six cases
expressed the HLA-A*0205 allele and were excluded from
the statistical analysis. Thus, 54 pairs were carriers of the
specific HLA molecules needed for HA-1 peptide presenta-
tion. When typed for this MiHAg, only six pairs were
mismatched (11.11%) vs. forty-eight identical pairs (88.89%).
Acute GVHD of grades II–IV occurred in only four HA-1
mismatched recipients vs. eleven matched pairs (Table 2).
Like the majority of cases, these four patients had received
CSA and MTX as prophylaxis for GVHD. When treated in
a univariate logistic regression model, HA-1 disparity
appeared to be correlated with an increased risk of acute
GVHD (p: 0.041, OR: 6.727) but showed only a trend toward
significance in the multivariate logistic regression analysis.
Furthermore, acute GVHD was not influenced by factors
such as sex mismatch, conditioning and patient age. All
results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.
With regard to chronic GVHD, this outcome occurred in
13 HA-1-matched pairs vs. only 4 mismatched pairs. When
we compared its incidence between HA-1-matched and
mismatched recipients, we found no significant difference.
This finding was determined from a statistical analysis
using Fisher’s exact test and verified with univariate and
multivariate logistic regression models (Tables 2 and 3).
Interestingly, chronic GVHD may be significantly promoted
by both donor/recipient sex mismatch and patient age
(adulthood). A total of 82.4% of patients who developed
chronic GVHD were sex mismatched with their siblings,
and 94.11% of patients who developed this outcome were
adults. None of the other risk factors, including condition-
ing and malignancy, were significant in the paradigm of
chronic GVHD incidence.
DISCUSSION
GVHD is one of the major complications of allogeneic
HSCT, even in an HLA genoidentity context.1–4
Disparity
between a recipient and his or her HLA-identical sibling for
certain minor histocompatibility antigens may be sufficient
to cause GVHD following HSCT.2,4–6
Based on these data,
we investigated the effect of recipient MiHAg-HA-1 dis-
parity on GVHD occurrence in a Tunisian series of HSC
allografts. After screening an HLA-A*0201/HLA-A*0206-
positive cohort, we performed HA-1 typing for each
recipient/donor pair. The correlation analysis showed that
acute GVHD may be affected by HA-1 mismatch because
Fisher’s p-value for this relationship was 0.044. This result
was confirmed by the univariate logistic regression analysis,
but in the multivariate regression model, we noticed only a
trend toward an increased probability of Acute GVHD of
grades II–IV. The same multivariate analysis showed no
significant association between risk factors such as patient
age, conditioning or sex mismatch and the incidence of
acute GVHD. As expected, our data support previously
reported findings correlating acute GVHD occurrence with
recipient HA-1 disparity,5,12–14
but a definitive conclusion
cannot be deduced. This fact may be explained by the
prophylactic protocol received by patients enrolled in each
study. Thus, we believe that the actual effect of HA-1
disparity cannot be evaluated in subjects who receive CSA
and MTX to prevent GVHD occurrence. Likewise, differ-
ences in the methods used for sample selection or GVHD
grading could affect the level of significance. In our opinion,
to assess this relationship more accurately, we need to
investigate the effect of HA-1 disparity in a universal
context, particularly in patients who have not received
GVHD prophylaxis. We believe that this procedure may be
feasible if it is performed first in murine models and then in
human patients.
Our study showed that chronic GVHD may be affected by
both donor/recipient sex mismatch and adulthood but not
by HA-1 disparity. Statistically, 82.4% of patients who
developed chronic GVHD were sex mismatched with their
HLA-identical siblings (recipient sex-ratio: 1.33). Further-
more, patient age appeared to be a critical player in chronic
GVHD onset because 94.11% of those patients who
developed chronic GVHD were adults. Both sex mismatch
and adulthood have been described as favorable conditions
for the occurrence of these effects, especially through T cells

alloreactivity against Y-encoded antigens when the recipi-
ent/donor pairs have different genders.5,29–31
Thus, our
findings are in agreement with those findings reported by
Gallardo et al.; in their large pool of patients, they found no
association between chronic GVHD and HA-1 disparity.13
On the other hand, chronic GVHD may be affected by
acute GVHD status. This outcome occurred in 53% of
patients who developed acute GVHD (data not shown). This
fact may be explained by the presence of T cells that are
primed by chronic antigen stimulation due to the presence
of ubiquitous MiHAgs.3
Our findings support previous data
qualifying acute GVHD as the main risk factor for the
development of chronic GVHD,32
but future studies are
needed to investigate the role of regulatory T cells, B cells
and other immune cells. In this regard, recent data have
suggested a critical role for humoral immunity in the
chronic GVHD paradigm because there is a strong correla-
tion between this outcome and both increased numbers of B
cells with altered Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9) responses and
the presence of antibodies against some minor histocompat-
ibility antigens.30,32–33
In conclusion, this study showed that acute GVHD but
not chronic GVHD may be affected by HA-1 disparity in
Tunisian HSC recipients. Consequently, we believe that
HA-1 typing may be useful in cases where there is more
than one HSC donor, which occurs frequently in Tunisian
families (data not shown). Overall, we believe that our results
are significant and can encourage further study in this area
of cell therapy in Tunisia because this study is the first to
report the role of immunogenetic markers in the occurrence
of GVHD. It will be important, however, to expand the
patient cohort and investigate the effects of HA-1 disparity
on other endpoints, including leukemia relapse, disease-free
survival and overall survival.
