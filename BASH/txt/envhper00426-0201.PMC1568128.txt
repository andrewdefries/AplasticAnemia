A retrospective cohort study was carried out in 1982-1983 among 28,460 benzene-exposed workers (15,643
males, 12,817 females) from 233 factories and 28,257 control workers (16,621 males, 12,366 females) from 83
factories in 12 large cities in China. All-cause mortality was significantly higher among the exposed
(265.46/100,000 person-years) than among the unexposed (139.06/100,000 person-years), as was mortality from
all malignant neoplasms (123.21/100,000 versus 54.7/100,000, respectively). For certain cancers, increased mor-
tality was noted among benzene-expoged males in comparison with that among unexposed males; the stan-
dardized mortality ratios (SMR) were elevated for leukemia (SMR = 5.74), lung cancer (SMR = 2.31), pri-
mary hepatocarcinoma (SMR = 1.12), and stomach cancer (SMR = 1.22). For females only leukemia occurred
in excess among the exposed. Risk of leukemia rose as duration to exposure to benzene increased up to 15
years, and then declined with additional years of exposure. Leukemia occurred among some workers with
as little as 6 to 10 ppm average exposure and 50 ppm-years (or possibly less) cumulative lifetime exposure
(based on all available measurements for the exposed work units). Among the 30 leukemia cases identified
in the exposed cohort, the proportion of subjects with acute lymphocytic leukemia was substantially lower
and the proportion with acute nonlymphocytic leukemias was higher than in the general population. Dur-
ing 1972 to 1981, the annual incidence of leukemia ranged from 5.83 to 28.33 per 100,000 with higher rates
occurring in the interval 1977 to 1981 than in the earlier years ofthe study period. Future studies should evalu-
ate more precisely the relationship between exposure levels, job title, and development of leukemia among
cases and noncases within the exposed cohort.

leukemia (1-3). A retrospective cohort investigation car-
ried out in the People's Republic of China during 1982 to
1983 among 28,460 benzene-exposed workers (15,643
males, 12,817 females) from 233 factories and 28,257 con-
trol workers (16,621 males, 12,336 females) from 83 fac-
tories in 12 large cities in China, provided additional evi-
dence supporting the benzene-leukemia association (4,5).
More detailed information about the relationship of aver-
age and cumulative lifetime benzene levels and duration
of exposure with development of leukemia is presented.
The types ofleukemia that occurred among the exposed
cohort are compared with the distribution of leukemia
types among the general population. All-cause mortality
as well as mortality from specific types of malignancies
in addition to leukemia is discussed.
Subjects and Methods
Benzene-exposed subjects were identified in work units
from 233 factories in 12 cities in China including Shang-
hai, Tianjin, Chengdu, Chongqing, Harbin, Shenyang,
Jinzhou, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng, Guangzhou, and
Nanchang. The primary types offactories or manufactur-

ing processes involving benzene exposure were spray or
brush painting, shoe manufacturing, synthetic rubber
production, leather processing, organic chemical, and
adhesive production facilities. An exposed subject had to
be working in an operation involving benzene exposure
for at least 6 months during the period January 1, 1972,
through December 31, 1981. There were 28,460 workers
(16,621 males, 12,336 females), with 178,556 person-years
of follow-up among the exposed.
Subjects in the control group consisted of28,257 work-
ers (16,621 males, 12,336 females) employed 6 months or
more during the same time interval as the cases, selected
from 83 factories in the same eities. Controls were em-
ployed in the manufacture of mechanical instruments,
textiles, and in clothing production and were not exposed
to benzene or any other known occupational carcinogen.
The sex and age distribution was similar to those of
benzene-exposed workers. For the unexposed group
there were 199,201 person-years of follow-up.
Exposed and unexposed workers were followed-up
from January 1, 1972, through December 31, 1981, using
factory (monthly or annual) salary lists to obtain informa-
tion about current status including continued employ-
ment, retirement, transfer, as well as vital status. Fac-
tory and hospital medical records were the source of
information about history of benzene poisoning, aplastic
anemia, leukemia, and other malignancies. Additional in-
formation about history ofmalignancies, malignant, and
nonmalignant causes of death, as well as history of smok-
ing was obtained from a number of possible sources.
These included interviews with subjects, their next-of-
kin; mailed questionnaires sent to family members of de-
ceased subjects; letters of inquiry sent to families or fac-
tories for workers who had transferred jobs; and hospital
death certificates or death registration forms kept on file
at the subject's local neighborhood police station. For de-
ceased subjects, date and cause of death, date of diagno-
sis of malignancies, and hospital of diagnosis were ab-
stracted from death certificates and hospital records.
Detailed information about histopathology, clinical, and
laboratory parameters was obtained for all subjects with
leukemia, aplastic anemia, and other hematopoietic and
lymphatic malignancies.
Factory records and interviews with factory supervi-
sors and subjects were the source of information about
products manufactured, raw materials used, production
processes, intermediates, and occupational history of sub-
jects. To determine benzene levels, data were abstracted
from factory records about benzene air level measure-
ments, benzene concentration levels in solvents, paint,
glue, adhesives, etc., and factories' records about environ-
mental measures and protective devices used to reduce
workers' benzene exposure.
All of the factories included in the benzene-exposed
group had records detailing benzene concentrations in
products used and air level measurements. Control fac-
tories were selected from among those with no evidence
of benzene, radiation, or other carcinogenic exposures.
Among the factories identified as having benzene-
exposed work units, the participation rate of these facil-
ities in the study was 99.2%, compared with 98.7% among
non-exposed factories.
Criteria used to designate benzene poisoning were
based on the "Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment of
Benzene Poisoning" published in 1974 by the Ministry of
Public Health (6). Cases of leukemia and aplastic anemia
were diagnosed at hospital departments ofinternal med-
icine and hematology and were classified for study pur-
poses as follows: a) grade I, II, bone marrow aspirate
and/or biopsy, blood smears, and other histopathologic
data used to confirm diagnosis, b) grade III,. diagnosis
based on clinical evaluation, c) grade IV, diagnosis in-
ferrred after death in the absence of clinical data. Among
the accepted leukemia study cases, 96.7% met the criteria
for grades I-II, whereas only 3.3% (1 case) were classi-
fied as grade III.
Data were collected at all collaborating factories, hospi-
tals, district health stations, etc., using a standardized ap-
proach. All forms and data items were checked following
abstraction, and missing values and errors were cor-
rected. Inaccurate or incomplete data that could not be
corrected were not included in the analyses.
Results
For males and females, age-adjusted all-cause mortal-
ity was significantly higher among the benzene-exposed
than among control workers (Table 1). For most age
groups evaluated, age-specific mortality was higher
among exposed workers 25 years ofage and older, except
for males ages 60 to 69 and females ages 30 to 34 and 55
to 64 as shown in Table 1.
All-cancer mortality was significantly higher among ex-
posed males under age 70 compared with unexposed
males (Table 2). For males aged 30 to 45 the cancer death
rate was more than twice as high among the exposed than
the unexposed, as seen in Table 2. The reverse was noted
for females, with cancer mortality actually higher among
the unexposed compared with the benzene-exposed
group.
Significantly elevated standardized mortality ratios
(SMRs) were noted among exposed compared with unex-
posed males for leukemia (SMR = 5.74) and lung cancer
(SMR = 2.31), whereas elevated but nonsignificant SMRs
were noted for cancers ofthe liver, stomach, esophagus,
intestine, nasopharynx, and lymphosarcoma, as shown in
Figure 1. With the exception of an elevated SMR for
leukemia, no major differences were found between ex-
posed and unexposed females (Fig. 1).
The distribution of cancer deaths by site, sex, and rank
among benzene-exposed and control workers is shown in
Table 3. The rank by cancer site on a national basis is also
provided for comparison. For exposed subjects, leukemia
is the fourth-ranked site for males and the first-ranked
site for females, whereas nationally leukemia is only the
seventh most common malignancy. For exposed males,
lung cancer is first, and for exposed females second com-
pared with its rank as the fifth most common site nation-
ally.

Though not shown, leukemia mortality among male
benzene-exposed smokers (91.1 per 100,000, unadjusted
by age) was not higher than leukemia mortality among
male exposed nonsmokers (128.2 per 100,000, unad-
justed). However, lung cancer mortality in males was sig-
nificantly higher among smokers in the benzene-exposed
group than among smokers in this cohort as shown in Ta-
ble 4. It is surprising to note that non-smokers in the
benzene-exposed group had substantially higher lung can-
cer mortality than nonsmokers in the control group, as
well as smokers (Table 4), though not statistically signif-
icant.
The relative risk ofleukemia increased with longer du-
ration of benzene exposure up to 15 years and then
declined with additional years of exposure. Figure 2 rep-
resents an orthogonal polynomial curve graphed using
the function of y = 15.024 + 3.67x - 0.117 x2, where y
is the risk of leukemia (mortality of leukemia in the ben-
zene exposed group/mortality of leukemia in the control
group) and x is the duration ofbenzene exposure in years.
For each of the 30 benzene-exposed leukemia cases,
average and cumulative lifetime levels of exposure were
estimated using all available measurements (Table 5). The
minimum average exposure was 6.5 mg/m3 and the
lowest cumulative lifetime exposure was estimated to be
33.2 mg/m3 years, as shown in Table 5. It is also interest-
ing to note that three cases had a lifetime cumulative ex-

nonlymphocytic leukemia compared with 50.1% of the
leukemia cases from the general population. Only 10% of
the cases among the exposed group had acute lympho-
cytic leukemia compared with 23.5% in the general popu-
lation.
Although the data are shown, the incidence ofleukemia
was higher in the later 5 years of the study period
(19.79/100,000) than in the earlier years (10.79/100,000).
However, the number of cases is too small to provide sta-
ble annual estimates.
Discussion
The substantially elevated risks for leukemia observed
for both males and females in the benzene-exposed cohort
confirm findings from earlier clinical reports and epidemi-
ologic studies. In 1928, Delore and Borgomano first
reported cases of benzene-caused leukemia in Italy (1).
Vigliani and Saita later estimated a 20-fold higher risk of
acute leukemia among printing shop workers and shoe-
makers in Milan and Pavia who were exposed to benzene
(7). Among atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, risk of leukemia was about 2.5-fold higher in
those with a past history ofexposure to benzene and med-
ical X-rays than in those without such exposures (8). Ak-
soy et al. identified 34 leukemia cases diagnosed during
1967 to 1975 among 28,500 shoemakers in Istanbul, Tur-
key, estimating an incidence of 13 per 100,000 compared
with approximately 6 per 100,000 in the general popula-
tion (9). An SMR of 5.6 for leukemia was noted in a
retrospective cohort study ofPliofilm workers employed
in factories in Akron, Ohio (10,11); for workers exposed
to benzene more than 5 years, the SMR for leukemia was
21.
Although there have been case reports of other malig-
nancies associated with benzene exposure (1), the current
investigation is one of the first analytic studies demon-
strating a significant excess of lung cancer and suggest-
ing possible increases of stomach, liver, esophagus, intes-
tine, and nasopharyngeal cancer, as well as lymphosar-
coma. The excess risk of leukemia among female workers
exposed to benzene has also not previously been
reported.
This retrospective cohort study was also one ofthe first
to evaluate the effect of smoking on cancer outcomes
among benzene-exposed and unexposed workers. No ef-
fect was found for smoking on leukemia mortality. Risk
of lung cancer was slightly higher among smokers than
among nonsmokers in the benzene-exposed group. How-
ever, nonsmokers among the benzene-exposed had a sig-
nificantly higher mortality than nonsmokers in the con-
trol group, suggesting that lung cancer was more
strongly related to benzene exposure than to smoking.
These surprising results require additional evaluation.

The findings of leukemia risk subsequent to relatively
low estimated average and cumulative lifetime benzene
exposure supports a recent report by Rinsky et al. (12).
However, these findings must be interpreted cautiously
because the estimated average and cumulative lifetime
benzene exposure levels are based on relatively few
measurements. In addition, it would be useful to evalu-
ate differences in average and cumulative benzene ex-
posure between leukemia cases and non-cases randomly
selected from the exposed cohort in order to more com-
pletely evaluate the relationship of benzene exposure
with development of leukemia.
This investigation is one of a few to evaluate the types
of leukemia occurring among benzene-exposed and com-
pare this distribution to that observed in a general popu-
lation. The results support findings from other studies of
an excess of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia among
benzene-exposed subjects (1,7-11).

STUDY OF LEUKEMIA AND OTHER CANCERS IN BENZENE WORKERS 213
One of the somewhat surprising findings in this
retrospective cohort study was the increase in all-cause
mortality. Further evaluation is underway to identify the
specific diseases primarily responsible for the excess, as
well as possible reasons for a relative deficit of these con-
ditions among the unexposed. Other reasons that might
explain the excess of deaths due to all causes and all
malignancies will also be examined in an expansion of the
present study conducted in collaboration with the U.S.
National Cancer Institute.
Preliminary findings suggest a risk ofleukemia, primar-
ily acute nonlymphocytic in type, from relatively low
average and cumulative benzene exposure. Risk ofleuke-
mia is elevated in females exposed to benzene, as well as
males, although the former do not seem to develop other
types of malignancies in excess following this exposure.
In summary, the present study has suggested that other
cancers, as well as some nonmalignant conditions, may be
associated with benzene exposure. Future studies should
evaluate more precisely and, in relation to nonleukemia
cases, the relationship between levels ofexposure and de-
velopment of leukemia. In addition, it would be useful to
determine which industries, occupations, and particular
job titles are linked with higher risks. Finally, possible
modifying factors affecting occurrence of leukemia (such
as radiaton, medications, other occupational exposures,
etc.) should be evaluated in nested case-control leukemia
studies, undertaken within large benzene-exposed co-
horts.
