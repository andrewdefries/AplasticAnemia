Occupational Lymphohematopoietic Cancer in Korea
The purpose of this study was to review the existing studies on lymphohematopoietic (LHP)
cancer in Korea, estimate the prevalence of workers exposed to carcinogens, and determine
the population attributable fraction (PAF) of leukemia. Two case series and 4 case reports
were reviewed. Using official statistics, the prevalence of benzene exposure and ionizing
radiation exposure was estimated. Based on the prevalence of exposure and the relative
risk, The PAF of leukemia was calculated. Between 1996 and 2005, 51 cases of LHP cancer
were reported from the compensation system. Greater than 50% of occupational LHP
cancer was leukemia, and the most important cause was benzene. In a cohort study, the
standardized incidence ratio was 2.71 (95% CI, 0.56–7.91). The prevalence of exposure was
2.5% and 2.2% in 1995 and 2000, respectively. Using the 1995 prevalence, 3.6-4.8% and
0.1% of cases with leukemia were attributable to benzene and ionizing radiation exposure,
respectively, which resulted in 39.7-51.4 cases per year. Benzene is the most important
cause of occupational leukemia in Korea. Considering the estimated PAF in this study, the
annual number of occupational LHP cancer (51 cases during 10-yr period), might be under-
reported within the compensation system.

REVIEW
Occupation & Environmental Medicine
INTRODUCTION
Lymphohematopoietic (LHP) cancers are amongst the most
commonwork-relatedmalignancies(1).TheInternationalAgen-
cy for Research on Cancer (IARC) (2) has strong evidence that
exposure to benzene, ethylene oxide, 1,3-butadiene, ionizing
radiation, and boot and shoe manufacturing and repair signifi-
cantlyincreasestheriskfordevelopingleukemiaandnon-Hodg-
kin lymphoma.
  Following the industrialization of Korea since 1960, the pet-
rochemical manufacturing industry expanded between 1970
and 1980 (3). Expenditures for benzene and 1,3-butadiene in-
creased and reached 3.9 and 0.9 million tons, respectively, by
1998 (4). Ionizing radiation was introduced in 1978 in nuclear
powerplantsandworkplacesusingnon-destructiveinstruments.
Medical professionals using radiography-generating devices
existed in Korea before 1970 (5). Official records of occupation-
al-related LHP cancer during 1960-1980 are not available; how-
ever, two cases of aplastic anemia in workers exposed to ben-
zene have been reported in historical records (6).
  Official statistics for occupational-related cancers in Korea
relies on reporting from the Korea Workers Compensation and
Welfare Service (COMWEL), which has been in existence since
1992. Workers’ compensation reports of LHP cancers, especially
leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, are the second most
commonoccupational-relatedcancersinKorea(7-15),asbased
on an epidemiologic investigation by the Occupational Safety
and Health Research Institute (OSHRI) of the Korea Occupa-
tional Safety and Health Agency (KOSHA). Annual compensa-
tion for LHP cancers has been reported in less than 10 cases (7,
11); however, these investigations were related to compensa-
tion issues, and the results do not reflect the total occurrence of
occupation-related LHP cancers in Korea.
  The global attributed fraction of occupational-related leuke-
mia, reported in a project conducted by the World Health Orga-
nization (WHO), is 2% of the population attributable fraction
(PAF) (1). Similarly, an estimate of the number of Korean work-
ers affected was attempted by Cho et al. (16), who reported that
0.8% of leukemias were attributable to occupational exposure
(16). A total of 2,289 cases of leukemia were registered in the
Central National Cancer Registry of Korea in 2005 (17); howev-
er, according to the estimation by Driscoll et al. (1), more than
45 cases of leukemia per year might be attributed to occupation-
al exposure. These estimates are proportional, and therefore
dependent on the prevalence of occupational and other carci-
nogenic risk factors in a population.
  To reveal the detailed features of occupational LHP cancers
in Korean workers, several studies on this topic have been con-
ducted which have reported the relative risk of benzene and
ionizing radiation exposure in Korean workers, and provided
useful information on prevalence of these cancers in Korean
workers (3, 14, 15, 18).

  The purpose of this study was to review the reported cases of
occupational-related LHP and studies on LHP cancers in Korea.
We also estimated the prevalence of risk factors regarding occu-
pational-related LHP cancers in Korean workers using official
statistics (19). With the estimated prevalence, we calculated the
PAF of leukemia in Korea and compared this data with the PAF
of leukemia from other reports using Levin’s formula (20).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Review of published studies
Theauthorsreviewedpreviouslypublishedcasesofoccupation-
al-related LHP cancer. Cases of LHP cancer from the workers’
compensation system have been reported in two studies. Kang
et al. (7) analyzed cancer cases, including reports of 10 LHP can-
cers which had been investigated by OSHRI/KOSHA during
1992-2000, included in the data from COMWEL that accounts
for related occupational diseases. Ahn (11) analyzed all com-
pensated LHP cases between 1996 and 2005 from the COMW-
EL data.
  In reviewing studies on occupational carcinogenic factors
and cancers in Korean workers, the authors selected 4 articles
which had been conducted since 2006. A study on occupation-
related LHP cancers and benzene exposure was conducted in
Korea (18). A cohort study involving benzene- and 1,3-butadi-
ene-exposed workers reported in 2010 from the petrochemical
industry focused on highly exposed groups (3). Another cohort
study involving iron steel workers also reported LHP cancer
morbidity which was apparently related to benzene exposure
(15). Lastly, a study focused on radiation-exposed workers in
Korea in 2008 (14). One of these reviewed studies reported the
estimation of the PAF in Korea (16).
Estimation of the prevalence of exposure
The prevalence of exposure of carcinogenic LHP cancers was
estimated in workers exposed to benzene and ionizing radia-
tion. The prevalence was used for calculating the PAF of LHP
cancers among total cancer mortality and incidence in 2005.
Considering the 5-10 yr latent period for LHP cancers (21) relat-
ed to benzene or ionizing radiation exposure, we estimated the
prevalence of exposure in the population for 1995 and 2000.
Benzene-exposedworkerswereestimatedbasedonthenational
survey of mining and manufacturing industries from the Kore-
an Statistical Information Service (KSIS) (19). Benzene has been
reported to be used in the petrochemical, shoe-making, and
painting-related industries, thus we determined the number of
workers in those industries from the KSIS system.
  Becauseofalackofinformation,1,3-butadiene-exposedwork-
ers were not included in this estimation of the prevalence. How-
ever, the major proportion of 1,3-butadiene was produced in
the petrochemical industry, therefore most 1,3-butadiene ex-
posures were included in the benzene-exposed workers.
  Ionizing radiation exposures have occurred in special indus-
tries, and are strictly controlled by government organizations.
The ionizing radiation-exposed population has been estimated
based on the number of radioisotopes used in industries from
the statistics of the Korea Radioisotope Association (5) and mul-
tiplying by the average number of workers.
  According to KSIS, the economically-active population count
in Korea in 1995 was 20.85 million (22). The survey from KSIS
was conducted on workers employed in manufacturing and
mining industries, which totaled 4.5 million. Notably excluded
were the workers in other industries and unemployed workers.
  To adjust for this bias, the authors adopted the following pro-
cess,accordingtotheIARCreportoncausesofcancersinFrance
(23).
  Step 1: The exposed proportion of workers for each carcino-
gen using the denominator was used according to
thesourceoftheinformationoftheeachcarcinogen.
  Step 2: The industries other than manufacturing or mining
included 13.7 million workers. This population was
susceptible to exposure, but at a much lower level
thanworkersinmanufacturingormining.One-fourth
of the prevalence estimated in Step 1 was applied to
this population.
  Step 3: Unemployed workers among the economically-ac-
tive population numbered 2.9 million. Because this
population could have been exposed during a previ-
ous occupation before the unemployed period, we
considered that unemployed workers had an occu-
pational prevalence of exposure equal to one-fourth
of the prevalence estimated in Step 1.
  Step 4: The population of individuals more than 65 yr of age
(2.6 million) might have past exposures which could
be higher than present levels, accounting for the de-
crease in exposure from occupational carcinogens.
We applied a correction factor of 1.25 to the preva-
lence of occupational exposure computed for the
overall economically-active population (Steps 1-3).
  Step 5: The prevalence from Step 1 was derived from cross-
sectional studies, which is based only on the last job
held. Hence, for the estimation of lifetime occupa-
tional prevalence of exposure, a factor of 4 was ap-
plied. This was based on the report involving the
lifetime turnover rate from the Korea Employment
Information System (24).
Calculation of the PAF
The relative risk (RR) reported the IARC, which was adopted in
the report demonstrating PAF analysis (23), was reviewed. Stud-
ies ontheRRofoccupation-relatedleukemiafromKoreanwork-
ers exposed to benzene (3, 18) and radiation (14) were also re-

viewed. A RR of 3.3 for leukemia from benzene exposure was
calculated from the IARC report (23), and 2.7 was calculated
from the Korean workers report (3). A RR for leukemia from
ionizing radiation was calculated to be 1.22 from the combined
analysis of the studies from the USA, UK, and Canada (25), and
0.59 from the Korean workers report (14).
  The PAF was calculated (vide infra) as the function of the RR
and the prevalence of exposure, as described by Levin (20).
PAF=P×(RR-1)/[P×(RR-1)+1]
P: prevalence of the workers exposed to a carcinogen
RR: relative risk
  The annual reports from the National Cancer Center of Korea
and KOSIS were used to calculate the mortality of leukemia (n=
670) (22) and the incidence (n=1,063) (17) of leukemia among
persons aged from 15-60 yr in 2005.
RESULTS
Case reports and case series
Baak et al. (13) reported a case of aplastic anemia from the pet-
rochemical industry in 1999. The workers were in a petroleum
resin-producing factory and had been exposed to a low-level of
benzene while packaging the powder resin and pouring lime
into a deactivation tank. The airborne benzene level was approx-
imately 0.28 ppm.
  Kang et al. (7) reported 34 cases of LHP cancers investigated
by OSHRI/KOSHA between 1992 and 2000. After the investiga-
tion,10of34caseswerefoundtobework-relatedcases(Table1).
There were 3 cases of acute myeloid leukemia, 4 cases of myelo-
dysplasticsyndrome,1caseofmyelofibrosis,1caseofnon-Hodg-
kin’s lymphoma,and1caseofmultiplemyeloma.Allofthecases
were male workers (32-58 yr of age). Four cases of LHP cancers
were determined not to be work-related based on the investiga-
tion by OSHRI/KOSHA. All cases, but one, were shown to be
benzene-related cancers. The length of employment was be-
tween 4 and 21 yr (Table 1).
  Ahn (11) reviewed 51 cases of LHP cancers, which had been
accepted for payment by COMWEL during 1996-2005 (Table 2).
The most common LHP cancer was myeloid leukemia, which
occurred in 21 among 51 cases. Lymphoid leukemia and aplas-
tic anemia were shown in 7 cases. Other cancers included non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (n=6), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=4),
multiple myeloma (n=2), and others (n=3). All but 3 cases in-

volvedmaleworkers.Themostcommoncausativeagentofcom-
pensated LHP cancers was benzene (n=43). Among the 43 ben-
zene exposure cases, 14 were shown to be due to pure benzene
exposure. Others were exposed to benzene through an impuri-
ty in mixtures, such as cement, solvent, cleaning agents, and
hardener. The records of exposure for benzene were available
in 16 of the cases, which ranged from 0.08-6.54 ppm. Ionizing
radiation exposure cases were determined in four workers (a
radiologist in a hospital, a radiation safety manager at a univer-
sity, a welder in a nuclear power plant, and a technician in a ra-
diation apparatus manufacturer). The amount of radiation ex-
posurefrom3ofthecaseswas0.49,19.9and31.8mSv.Themean
latency was 15.5 yr (16.1 yr for benzene and 9.5 yr for ionizing
radiation).
 
Cohort studies
The first attempt for a cohort study on occupation-related can-
cers in the Korean working population was conducted by Ahn
(18) (Table 3). This cohort involved recruiting workers who re-
ceived workers’ medical monitoring for occupational exposure
to carcinogens, including benzene. The cohort included 24,279
workers who received medical monitoring from 2000-2004.
Among the total cohort, 16,288 workers were exposed to ben-
zene. To calculate the standardized rate ratio (SRR), an internal
comparison group was selected from the workers who were not
exposedtobenzeneinthecohort.TheSRRwas0.38(range,0.05–
3.10) for the incidence of LHP cancer, and 1.82 (range, 0.51-6.5)
for LHP cancer admissions.
  Another cohort study on benzene- and 1,3-butadiene-ex-
posed workers was conducted at the petrochemical complex
located in the southern part of Korea (Yeosu and Kwangyang
regions; Table 3) (3). This cohort consisted of 43,000 workers,
temporary construction workers who were supposedly exposed
to the highest levels of benzene. During the benzene manufac-
turing process in the petrochemical industries, the construction
workers did the maintenance work of connecting, disconnect-
ing, evacuating,andcleaningthevariousvesselsandpipes. Dur-
ing these processes, which were referred to as the ‘shut down’
process, the workers were exposed to benzene levels of up to
hundreds of ppm. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was
1.46 (95% CI, 0.39–2.78) for leukemia and 1.24 (95% CI, 0.15–
4.47)fornon-Hodgkin’slymphoma.Thestandardizedincidence
ratio (SIR) was 2.71 (95% CI, 0.56–7.91) for leukemia and 1.83
(95% CI, 0.38-5.34) for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

Based on the results, the incidence of LHP cancer compared to

duction process in the plants (SRR, 3.46; 95% CI, 1.02-8.91).
  Cancer mortality and morbidity in Korean workers exposed
to ionizing radiation was described for the first time in 2008
(Table 3) (14). The mean cumulative exposure dose of radiation
was6.4mSv.Amajorityofthestudypopulation(68.9%)hadbeen
exposed to 0.01-9.99 mSv; however, only 2.5% of them were ex-
posed to more than 50 mSv. The SMR for leukemia and non-
Hodgkin’slymphomawas0.59(95%CI,0.28-1.06)and1.26(95%
CI, 0.63-2.22), respectively.

Prevalence of exposure and the PAF
Themajorindustriesrelatedtobenzeneexposureareshoemak-
ing, painting, and printing and petrochemicals (Table 4). The
number of workers exposed to benzene and ionizing radiation
were 130,674 in 1995 and 125,049 in 2000. Compared to 1995,
the number of petrochemicals and shoe manufacturers was
decreased, while the painting, printing, and ionizing radiation
industries increased in number in 2000.
  After applying the correction process, as described in the
Methods section, the prevalence of benzene- and ionizing radi-
ation-exposed workers was 2.51% and 2.21% in 1995 and 2000,
respectively.
  Using the 1995 prevalence of exposure, 4.8% of leukemias
were attributable to benzene and 0.1% to radiation (Table 5).
Using the prevalence from 2000, the PAF was lower than that
based on the prevalence in 1995. Because the Korean RR of ra-
diation exposure was less than 1, the PAF based on the RR of
Korean workers was lower than the PAF based on the IARC.
DISCUSSION
Greater than 50% of the reported occupational LHP cancers
have been leukemia and lymphoma since 1996 (Tables 1, 2).
Most of the reported LHP cancers in this review were related to
compensation issues. The compensation of diseases from oc-
cupational exposure has been based on the public insurance
system since 1963 and the premium should be paid by the em-
ployer. Therefore, the compensated cancers could not represent
the total number of occupational LHP cancers in Korea.
  Thedecision-makingprocessforcompensationatCOMWEL,
especially on the topic of cancers from occupational exposure,
largely depends on the epidemiologic investigations of OSHRI/
KOSHA.Duetothelackofprofessionalinvestigationproficiency,
COMWEL requested a scientific decision on the work-related-
ness of the cancer cases from OSHRI/KOSHA since 1992 (Table
1). Through cooperation between COMWEL and OSHRI, the
decision regarding the work-relatedness of LHP cancers was
reasonably accurate.
  The major etiologic agents of occupational LHP cancer in
this review were restricted to benzene and ionizing radiation
(Table 2). Although 1,3-butadiene and ethylene oxide are listed

asIARCgroup1carcinogens,theexposureassessment for those
agents in Korea is conducted very irregularly.
  The most common causative agents of compensated LHP
cancers were due to benzene exposure (83%). According to the
investigation of the individual cases (11), only 14 cases, mainly
from the petrochemical industry, of the 43 benzene exposure
cases were related to pure benzene exposure. Other cases were
found because of exposure to benzene as an impurity in mix-
tures and the levels of exposure for benzene were relatively low
(<1 ppm).
  The levels of benzene exposure in Korea have decreased con-
tinuously. The Occupational Exposure Level (OEL) in Korea for
benzene was 25 ppm until 1970, according to the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of Korea. With this Act, there wasenforce-
ment of regulations for worker’s safety and health by the Minis-
try of Employment and Labor; the OEL was 10 ppm until 2003.
The average level of exposure of benzene in the leather and
chemical product industries was 2–23 ppm, with a wide range
of 0.1-56.9 (26). After 2003, the OEL of benzene was lowered to
1 ppm. As a result of this, the average airborne concentration of
benzene in most industries was less than 1 ppm, except for the
temporary workers in the petrochemical plants (3).
  Only 51 cases of LHP during a span of 10 yr were compensat-
ed inKorea,whichseemstobelowcomparedtoGermany,where
153 leukemia cases were compensated between 1991 and 1994
(27). However in Italy, only 10 cases of leukemia (28) were com-
pensated between 1989 and 1994, which is similar with Korea.
  Using 1995 prevalence of exposure levels, 3.6-4.8% of leuke-
mia were expected to be attributable to benzene exposure and
0.1% for radiation exposure (Table 5). Therefore, annually 39.7-
51.4 cases of leukemia are supposed to be caused by workplace
exposures. Thus, there might be more workers that are lost in
the compensation system.
  Using the prevalence levels of 2000, the PAFs were lower than
those using 1995 prevalence levels. Based on the level of expo-
sure of major carcinogenic factors, benzene exposure was de-
creased after 2000, and the PAF using the 2000 exposure preva-
lence was lower than the PAFs using the 1995 prevalence.
  The PAF of leukemia in this study was similar to the reported
levels from France in 2000 (4.1%) (23). The possibility of under-

izing radiation and benzene exposure. The 1,3-butadiene and
ethylene oxide were confirmed carcinogens by IARC and the
LHP cancers attributed to occupational exposure might be high-
er if the information from these carcinogens was included.
  In conclusion, leukemias related to benzene exposure are the
most important diseases which are attributed to occupational
exposure. Although the compensated cases are less than 10 cas-
es per year, according to the estimated PAF for leukemias in this
study, the annual cases of occupation-related leukemia are cal-
culated to be between 39.7 and 51.4 cases, which implies an
under-reporting in the compensation system. Several studies
for occupation-based LHP cancers have been reported since
1995, most of these are case reports or case series. Further re-
search into long-term follow-up studies is necessary.
