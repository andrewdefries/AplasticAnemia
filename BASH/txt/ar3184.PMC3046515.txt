Abstract
Introduction: While the role of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in the management of lupus nephritis has been
increasingly recognized, limited information is available regarding its efficacy and safety as a long-term
maintenance treatment. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of MMF as
maintenance therapy for proliferative lupus nephritis.
Methods: Thirty-three consecutive patients with proliferative lupus nephritis received induction therapy with five
to seven monthly intravenous (iv) pulses of cyclophosphamide (CYC) plus iv steroids followed by oral MMF 2 g/day
as maintenance therapy for a median time of 29 months (range 9 to 71 months). Primary end points were the
achievement of renal remission, complete renal remission, disease remission - renal and extrarenal -, the occurrence
of renal relapse, chronic renal failure and death. Secondary end points were the extrarenal disease activity and
drug adverse events. The clinical and laboratory parameters were compared during follow-up by means of
nonparametric statistical tests. Time to event analysis was performed according to the Kaplan-Meier method.
Results: A significant improvement of all renal parameters was observed at the end of the induction treatment
and at the latest follow-up compared to baseline. The rate of patients achieving renal remission until the end of
follow-up was 73%, whereas that of complete renal remission was 58%. The median survival times in the Kaplan-
Meier analyses were 7 and 16 months, respectively. Remission was maintained in all but four (12%) patients who
relapsed within 19 to 39 months after initial response. At the end of follow-up, 51% of the patients had reached
disease remission. The median survival time of disease remission was 18 months. Extrarenal manifestations were
well controlled in most of the patients. In one patient receiving MMF, extrarenal activity led to treatment
discontinuation. Non life-threatening drug adverse events developed in 18 patients (58%) and included infections,
amenorrhea, myelotoxicity, gastrointestinal complications, hypercholesterolemia, alopecia and drug intolerance.
None of the patients developed chronic renal insufficiency or died from any cause.
Conclusions: MMF appeared to be efficacious and safe as maintenance treatment for proliferative lupus nephritis.
Introduction
Lupus nephritis, particularly the proliferative form, is
among the most common and severe manifestations of
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) leading to signifi-
cant morbidity and mortality if left untreated [1]. Ther-
apy aims to prevent evolution to end-stage renal disease
and reduce mortality by early induction of remission
and long-term prevention of recurrence. Intermittent
intravenous (iv) pulses of cyclophosphamide (CYC) in
combination with iv or oral steroids have been the stan-
dard of care for induction of remission, with long-term
quarterly iv CYC pulses used as remission maintenance
treatment [2,3]. However, the benefits of CYC have
been limited by the significant drug-related toxicities
including sustained amenorrhea as well as the possibility
of no response or relapse in a substantial number of
these patients [4-6]. In this context, alternative thera-
peutic modalities and the use of less toxic agents, such

as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or azathioprine, have
been sought [7,8].
MMF is a relatively new immunosuppressive agent
initially used in solid organ transplantation with selec-
tive inhibitory effects on activated T and B lymphocytes.
In recent years, MMF has been considered an important
alternative agent for lupus nephritis refractory to other
treatments and has also been studied as an induction
therapy agent with promising results and mild toxicity
[9-13]. However, recent prospective data have failed to
demonstrate the superiority of MMF over iv CYC as an
induction therapy [14]. Sequential regimens of short-
term iv CYC followed by either MMF or azathioprine
maintenance therapy have been shown to be efficacious
and safe in reducing the long-term exposure to CYC,
mainly in African-American or Hispanic patients [15].
The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effi-
cacy and safety profile of MMF as maintenance therapy
for proliferative lupus nephritis in a single center cohort
of patients with proliferative lupus nephritis.
Materials and methods
Study design
Thirty-three consecutive patients with proliferative lupus
nephritis class III (n = 20), IV (n = 7) or V with III/IV
lesions (n = 6) according to the revised World Health
Organization (WHO) classification [16] were recruited
and prospectively followed up between 2001 and 2008.
All patients received induction therapy with five to
seven iv monthly pulses of CYC 1 g/m2
(five pulses
n = 5; six pulses n = 24; seven pulses n = 4) in associa-
tion with iv pulses of 1 g methylprednisolone [2] fol-
lowed by 2 g/day MMF according to a standardized
protocol. The five patients who stopped induction ther-
apy at five CYC pulses developed CYC-related drug side
effects, while the four patients who received seven CYC
pulses had active deteriorating renal disease. All patients
fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)
classification criteria for SLE [17]. Exclusion criteria
included non-adherence to the treatment protocol as
well as irregular or lost follow-up (n = 3). Patients with-
out renal biopsy or with a histological diagnosis of
nephritis more than two months prior to treatment
initiation were excluded from the study (n = 1).
All patients receiving CYC also received mesna
(sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulfonate at three-fourths of
the CYC dose) to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis and 16
mg of ondansetron to prevent nausea and vomiting with
every CYC pulse. Oral methylprednisolone was given in
all but one patient at the dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day for
mild to moderate and severe extrarenal manifestations,
respectively, with subsequent dose tapering based on
extrarenal activity. As severe extrarenal manifestations
were considered the involvement of the central nervous
system, myocarditis, mesenteric vasculitis, hemolytic or
aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia < 50,000/mm3
, leu-
copenia < 1,000/mm3
, while as mild to moderate the
presence of general symptoms, joint involvement, myal-
gias, acute rash, oral ulcers, serositis, myositis, pneumo-
nitis, hepatosplenomegaly/increased liver enzymes,
leucopenia > 1,000/mm3
and thrombocytopenia
> 50,000/mm3
. No patient required the administration
of iv steroids during the maintenance treatment.
Patients were followed up every month during induc-
tion therapy and every three months during mainte-
nance treatment. During each visit the patients were
evaluated by a complete physical examination as well as
routine laboratory testing (blood count, biochemical
tests, inflammatory markers, urine analysis and measure-
ment of proteinuria in 24-hour urine collection). More-
over, drug side effects were recorded. The European
Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement (ECLAM) score
[18] was recorded at baseline, at the end of the induc-
tion treatment and at the latest follow-up. Renal-biopsy
specimens were examined by light microscopy and
immunofluorescence. Activity and chronicity indexes
were estimated according to the scoring system of Aus-
tin et al. [19]. The presence of crescents (≥ 1/biopsy
specimen), fibrinoid necrosis/karyorrhexis (≥ 1/biopsy
specimen), interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and glo-
merulosclerosis (≥ 1 lesion/biopsy specimen) was also
recorded.
Informed consent was obtained from all patients. The
design of the work has been approved by the hospital
ethical committee and the study has been carried out in
accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medi-
cal Association.
End points and definitions
Primary end points were the achievement of renal
remission, complete renal remission, disease remission,
the occurrence of renal relapse, chronic renal failure
and death. Secondary end points were the extrarenal
disease activity and medication-related adverse events.
Renal remission was defined as the presence of all the
criteria below in at least two measurements one month
apart: a.) a decrease of ≥ 50% in proteinuria and protei-
nuria < 3 g/24 h; b.) absence of hematuria (red blood
cells (RBCs) ≤ 5 hpf); c.) absence of pyuria (white blood
cells (WBCs) ≤ 5 hpf), d.) absence of cellular casts (<1
hpf); and e.) stable (fluctuations within 10% of the initial
value) glomerular filtration rate (GFR) if baseline serum
creatinine < 2 mg/dl or improvement ≥ 30% if baseline
serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dl. Renal relapse was defined
as an: a.) increase of ≥ 50% in proteinuria and protei-
nuria > 1 g/24 h, and/or b.) hematuria (RBCs > 5 hpf),
and/or c.) pyuria (WBCs > 5 hpf), and/or d.) cellular
casts (≥ 1 hpf), and/or e.) a decrease of ≥ 30% in GFR in

at least two measurements. Complete renal remission
was considered if the patients presented with all the cri-
teria below in at least two measurements one month
apart: a.) proteinuria 24 h ≤ 500 mg, b.) RBCs ≤ 5
hpf, c.) WBCs ≤ 5 hpf, d.) absence of cellular casts (<1
hpf), and e.) GFR of ≥ 80 ml/minute/1.733
. Chronic
renal failure was considered the sustained increase (for
more than four months) in serum creatinine to at least
twice the baseline value or the need for long-term dialy-
sis, or renal transplantation. The above definitions were
met according to the ACR response criteria for prolif-
erative and membranous renal disease in SLE clinical
trials [20]. The Modification of Diet and Renal Disease
(MDRD) equation was used to determine GFR [21].
Only causes of renal abnormalities attributed to lupus
nephritis were taken into consideration in the above
definitions and other possible causes were always
excluded. Disease remission was defined as the combi-
nation of complete renal remission and absence of
extrarenal manifestations. Myelotoxicity was defined by
the presence of cytopenia along with consistent features
of myelosuppression on bone marrow biopsy. Amenor-
rhea was defined as the loss of three or more menstrual
cycles, whereas sustained amenorrhea as the lack of
menses for at least 12 months.
Statistical analysis
Scaled and/or ordinal patient characteristics were com-
pared during follow-up using the Wilcoxon test for
paired observations and nominal parameters using the
McNemar test. Time to event analysis was performed
according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Results were
considered significant when P-values were ≤ 0.05. Ana-
lysis was conducted in SPSS version 13. All P-values are
two-tailed.
Results
Patient characteristics at baseline and during follow-up
The baseline patient characteristics are shown in Tables
1 and 2. The median duration of treatment was 29
months (range 9-71), while the median oral methylpred-
nisolone dose until the end of follow-up was 7.6 (range
0-21.2) mg. Most patients had focal proliferative glomer-
ulonephritis. Moderate activity and relatively low chroni-
city indexes were observed in renal biopsy (median 4
and 1, respectively). Adverse predictive factors such as
proteinuria of nephrotic range, low GFR, crescents, fibri-
noid necrosis, interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis
were present in 36%, 58%, 31%, 27%, 53% and 53% of
patients, respectively. Renal function deteriorated in 8
patients promptly after treatment initiation, while five of
them presented with acute renal insufficiency. Hyperten-
sion was present in all but one of these patients at
baseline.
Proteinuria resolved in 19 out of 29 (65%) patients
within a median time of eight (range 1 to 30) months
(Figure 1), whereas GFR normalized in 10 out of 19
(53%) patients within 10.5 (3 to 21) months (Figure 2).
In six out of the eight patients with rapid renal function
deterioration shortly after onset of treatment, GFR rates
did not return to normal, however, at the end of follow-
up, in all eight patients serum creatinine levels reached
at least the baseline values. None of the patients
received renal replacement therapy. Hematuria remitted
in 21 out of 29 (72%) patients after a median (range)
time of two (1 to 12) months and pyuria in 12 out of 18
(67%) patients within six (1 to 10) months.
A significant improvement of all renal parameters as
well as ECLAM score was observed at the end of the
induction treatment and at the latest follow-up com-
pared to baseline (Table 2). A comparison between the
end of the induction therapy and the end of follow-up
revealed that certain parameters such as GFR and pro-
teinuria were further improved during the maintenance
treatment, however, with the most sharp changes being
observed during the induction treatment with CYC
(Table 2). Interestingly, when GFR values of the 19

improvement was demonstrated during the maintenance
but not during the induction treatment (Table 2).
Outcome measures
Primary end points
Renal remission Fifteen out of 33 patients (45%)
reached renal remission until the end of the induction
treatment, whereas at the end of follow-up, the rates of
patients achieving renal remission were 73% (Table 2).
The median renal remission time in the Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis was seven months (Figure 3).
Complete renal remission Complete renal remission
was achieved in 8 out of 33 patients (24%) at the end of
the induction phase, while rates of complete remission
of renal disease significantly increased to 58% (19

remission (12%) (Table 2, Figure 5). The time from
remission to relapse ranged between 19 and 39 months,
while the time from baseline to relapse ranged between
25 and 41 months. One patient was in both renal and
complete renal remission for 19 months when she pre-
sented pyuria, a slight increase in proteinuria (600 mg
in 24-hour urine collection), associated with fever, a vas-
culitic finger rash and an elevated erythrocyte sedimen-
tation rate. Another patient being in renal and complete
renal remission for 39 and 38 months, respectively, pre-
sented with hematuria. The third patient was in renal
remission for 28 months, nevertheless, a low level of
proteinuria (500 mg in 24-hour urine collection)
persisted during follow-up. She relapsed with hematuria
as well as an increase in proteinuria (1.1 g in 24-hour
urine collection). Finally, the fourth patient was in renal
remission for 33 months, and complete renal remission
for 27 months, when proteinuria of 1.1 g in 24-hour
urine collection as well as hypertension were observed.
The mean ECLAM score of these four patients at the
time of relapse was 5.1.
Disease remission Disease remission was observed in
four patients (12%) at the end of the induction treat-
ment. At the end of follow-up, 17 out of 33 (51%)
patients had reached disease remission (Table 2). The
median survival time in the Kaplan-Meier analysis was

Chronic renal failure-death None of the patients
developed chronic renal insufficiency or died.
Secondary end points
Extrarenal manifestations Extrarenal manifestations at
baseline and during follow-up as well as the time to
resolution of each symptom are shown in Table 3. The
majority of the initial extrarenal manifestations resolved
during the induction treatment; however, in some
patients, the resolution of skin involvement, serositis,
anemia and leucopenia was observed during the mainte-
nance treatment (Table 3). Joint involvement, rash, con-
stitutional symptoms and leucopenia were among the
most frequently observed extrarenal manifestations dur-
ing follow-up (Table 3). MMF was discontinued in one
patient who developed shrinking lung syndrome 11
months after the onset of treatment.
Side effects Eighteen out of the 33 patients experienced
drug side effects (54%), (10 CYC-related and 12
MMF-related). Eight patients (24%) experienced severe
infections during follow-up; three during the induction
treatment (one fungal vaginitis, one systemic CMV
infection, one sinusitis) and five during the maintenance
treatment (four herpes zoster infections, one chlamydia-
related myocarditis). Amenorrhea developed in 14% (4/
28) of women and sustained amenorrhea in 4% (1/28).
Three patients had CYC-related myelotoxicity.
One patient developed a CYC-related infusion reaction
(3%). No hemorrhagic cystitis was observed. Alopecia
developed in one patient during MMF treatment (3%).
Transient gastrointestinal complications were experi-
enced by two patients during the maintenance treatment
(6%) (one ulcerative gastritis, one gastrointestinal dis-
comfort). Finally, hypercholesterolemia developed in
four patients (12%) treated with MMF.
Discussion
In the present study we aimed to investigate the safety
and efficacy of MMF as sequential maintenance therapy
for proliferative lupus nephritis following induction
treatment with a short-course of iv CYC. Satisfactory
response rates and acceptable tolerance profile were
observed in most patients. Remission as well as com-
plete renal remission occurred in a high percentage of
patients, 73% and 58%, respectively, while relapse rates
were low (12%). No severe complications such as
chronic renal failure or death from any cause occurred.
Moreover, a complete resolution of disease activity -
renal and extrarenal - was evident in half of patients
(51%).
Disease activity was suppressed in the majority of
patients at the end of the induction treatment as evi-
denced by a significant improvement of all renal para-
meters. Furthermore, the majority of extrarenal
manifestations resolved within the first months of treat-
ment. Sequential therapy with MMF led to further
improvement in renal disease outcome and maintained

the initial response in the majority of patients. It is of
note that renal remission occurred more frequently dur-
ing induction therapy, whereas complete renal remission
as well as disease remission were usually observed sub-
sequently, during the maintenance treatment. At this
point, we should emphasize the potential benefit from iv
corticosteroid pulses in addition to CYC during the
induction therapy. Given that previous evidence sup-
ports the beneficial role of iv corticosteroids over pulse
CYC alone in the preservation of renal function in the
long-term follow-up, we cannot exclude a long-term
benefit from the use of iv methylprednisolone pulses in
our patients [2].
While the majority of data regarding the therapeutic
role of MMF is limited to lupus nephritis, its efficacy in
lupus-related non-renal manifestations has not been
widely studied. Limited evidence indicates that MMF
may be effective in refractory hematological and derma-
tological manifestations; a reduced disease activity, as
assessed by the SLEDAI (SLE disease activity index) and
a significant reduction in the oral corticosteroid dose
have also been described [22-25]. A recently published,
multicenter, randomized clinical trial showed that MMF
is a suitable alternative to CYC for the treatment of
renal and non-renal disease manifestations in patients
with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis [26]. In agreement
with these observations, in our study, most of the base-
line extrarenal manifestations resolved after treatment
onset and new manifestations occurred relatively rarely.
In regard to toxicity, treatment with MMF after a
short-course of CYC was shown to be safe and well tol-
erated in most of our patients. Infections, despite their
severity, did not lead to life-threatening complications.
On the other hand, gastrointestinal intolerance due to
MMF was rare and reversible and the majority of
women preserved ovarian function. This observation is
in accord with the study of Ioannidis et al. suggesting
that patients at high risk are those who exceed the total
CYC dose of 12 g per body surface [4]. In regard to
myelotoxicity, MMF was shown to be safe since overt
bone marrow suppression was a complication of CYC
and not MMF in our study, although serious myelotoxi-
city due to CYC has been previously reported to be
rather uncommon [27]. Notably, no episodes of hemor-
rhagic cystitis occurred.
The decision on the maintenance treatment of prolif-
erative lupus nephritis is an important issue in clinical
practice. There is only one published randomized trial
in the literature, the Contreras trial, providing data on
patients treated with MMF maintenance therapy after a
short course of iv CYC [15]. Our study supports the
observations previously described with comparable renal
remission and relapse rates. Moreover, a similar propor-
tion of patients developed infections and nausea/
vomiting, while the rates of women with sustained ame-
norrhea were comparable. In contrast to the study by
Contreras et al., where one death (5%) due to severe
infection and one episode of chronic renal failure (5%)
occurred, in our study such outcomes were not
observed. In a more recent retrospective study from
Turkey including patients with proliferative but also
membranous nephritis receiving the above sequential
regimen, disease outcomes similar to ours were reported
[28]. Nevertheless, diarrhea due to MMF was more fre-
quently described in this cohort.
The comparison of MMF to the standard therapy of
long-term iv CYC pulses as maintenance therapies for
proliferative lupus nephritis has been studied in the trial
by Contreras et al. MMF was shown to be superior over
CYC both in terms of renal relapse and drug side effects
(infections, amenorrhea, leucopenia). In line with these
observations, we recently demonstrated a five-fold lower
risk of sustained amenorrhea after a short duration
treatment with CYC followed by MMF compared to
long-term CYC administration (51% vs. 4%) [29]. More-
over, unpublished data on a historical cohort of 46
patients treated with long-term intermittent CYC pulses
in our department, matched for age, sex and renal dis-
ease severity with the prospectively evaluated popula-
tion, demonstrated fewer relapses during MMF
maintenance treatment (12% vs. 22%), while remission
rates between patients treated with CYC-MMF and the
historical cohort were similar (73% vs. 70%). The exist-
ing literature on lupus nephritis treated with intermit-
tent iv CYC pulses reveals similar concussions.
Approximately 15 to 38% of patients did not respond to
treatment with CYC in previous studies, while renal
relapse occurred in 37% and 40% of patients in two stu-
dies and at a lower percentage (14%) in another one
[2,5,6,14,15,30-32]. Taking into consideration that renal
flares have been previously shown to be strong predic-
tors of poor long-term renal outcome due to their
potential for cumulative damage [33], the combination
CYC-MMF emphasizes a potentially better long-term
efficacy of MMF vs. CYC as maintenance therapy.
In addition to the end points studied by Contreras et
al., in our study, we evaluated the achievement of com-
plete renal remission. Interestingly, when compared to
the historical cohort, MMF seemed to be superior over
long-term intermittent CYC pulses (58% compared to
37% of the patients went into complete renal remission).
The role of complete renal remission for renal and
patient survival was investigated in the study by Chen et
al. [34]. The renal survival at 10 years was 94% for com-
plete remission, 45% for partial, and 19% for no remis-
sion, while the patient survival without end-stage renal
disease at 10 years was 92% for complete, 43% for par-
tial, and 13% for no remission. The above observation

emphasizes the potential beneficial role of MMF for
renal and patient survival in the long-term.
On the other hand, the already reported evidence on
the use of azathioprine in the maintenance therapy of
lupus nephritis has shown similar efficacy and toxicity
to MMF [11,15,28]. Compared to the present results,
sequential regimens of short-term CYC followed by
azathioprine usually demonstrated slightly higher relapse
rates; approximately 30% vs. 12% [7,11,15]. In our cen-
ter, limited information is yet available regarding the use
of azathioprine following induction therapy with iv CYC.
More data are awaited in order to draw conclusions
based on our population regarding the optimal substi-
tute for CYC in the maintenance therapy of proliferative
lupus nephritis.
The optimal treatment duration in patients with
remitting proliferative lupus nephritis treated with MMF
has not been clarified. Prospective controlled studies are
awaited to address what is the optimal MMF dosage
used for maintenance of remission and whether remis-
sion-maintenance therapy with MMF can be reduced or
withdrawn safely. Preliminary, yet unpublished, data
from our department support the possibility of gradual
drug discontinuation in responders. Reducing MMF >
1.5 years after the achievement of remission and/or
complete remission may warrant drug tapering without
disease flaring.
Finally, our results should be interpreted in the con-
text of potential limitations. The present study is an
observational study and is limited by the absence of a
randomized control group. Moreover, we should take
into consideration that our cohort consisted of Cauca-
sian patients. Since a better response to MMF has been
previously demonstrated by non-Caucasian patients
[12,14], our results might not have wide application.
Nevertheless, the present study provides valuable infor-
mation on the critical issue of maintenance treatment
decision in lupus nephritis given the significant number
of SLE patients studied, the long period of follow-up,
the stringent definitions used for all the investigated
parameters and clinical outcomes, and the opportunity
to have detailed information on the patients’ characteris-
tics during a regular follow-up. Moreover, our results
are strengthened by the comparison to an historic con-
trol group. Of course, larger controlled trials would
ascertain our observations.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the present study supports the efficacy
and safety of MMF as maintenance treatment for prolif-
erative lupus nephritis following an intensive induction
therapy with a short-course of iv CYC. The benefit of
MMF may translate to improved complete renal remis-
sion and relapse rates as well as reduction in CYC-
associated toxicity, which predicts a better long-term
disease outcome. Moreover, MMF appears to have bene-
ficial effects in controlling the extrarenal manifestations
of SLE.
