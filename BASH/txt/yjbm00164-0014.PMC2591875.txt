A relationship between serum muramidase (lysozyme) activity and granulocyte
kinetics has been described (1-5). Increased turnover of polymorphonuclear leu-
kocytes and monocytes usually is associated withi increased serum muramidase
activity. Conditions associated with reduced numbers of granulocytes, such as
aplastic anemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia, frequently have reduced serum
muramidase activity(3,4). Nitrogen mustard-induced granulocytopenia in rabbits
results in reduction in serum muramidase activity whereas rapid granulocyte de-
struction in response to an injection of antigranulocyte serum causes a transitory
increase in serum muramidase activity(6). These clinical observations and experi-
ments all are in accord witlh the concept that most of the serum muramiclase is
lerived from the degradation of granulocytes and monocytes, and that a direct
quantitative relationslhip exists between the turnover of these cells and serum
enzyme activity. These studies suggest the possibility that tissue muramidase may
be mostly of leukocyte origin. In order to test this hypotlhesis, the distribution of
muramidase in serum ancd tissues was studied in rats treated with intravenous
nitrogen mustard and correlatedl with changes in circulating leukocytes and tissue
hiistology. The total animal muramidase pool was also estimated.
METHODS
All studlies were performiedI on male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-300 g.
They were mainitained on a stanclard lab chow and water ad lib.

Total rat muramiclase activities were determined by two different techniques,
eaclh carried out oni 24-36 rats. The first techniquLe involved (leatlh by cervical dis-
locationi after wlhich the entire animal was passed through a meat grinder. Total
rat muramiclase activity was calculated from the results of mturamidase assay of
aliquots (of hoomogenates) of this material. The second metho(d consistedl of
cervical dislocation deatlh followed by individual organ muramiclase assay with
summation of the results for each animal in order to (letermine total rat enzyme
activity. Total marrow mass and serum volume were estimated on the basis of
publislhed standard values(7,8).
The effect of severe granulocytopenia on organ muramidase activity was deter-
mined in a group of 36 rats. Freshly prepared nitrogen mustard in a dose of 0.1
mg/kg was administere(d to 30 of the rats. At 24 h intervals therea7fter, ancl for
the next 8 (lays two or more animals were killed by means of rapid exsanguina-
tion wlhile und(ler etlher narcosis. Aluramidase activity was (letermined for each
organ or tissue removed. The remaining rats served as controls. Each control
animal was given saline in place of nitrogen mustard and then killed for tissue
murami(lase activity after rapid exsanguination. The combined daily results for
each organ in the nitrogen mustard group was expressed as percentage of the
combined results for each organ in the control group. Total and differential
leukocyte counts andl hiistologic sections of tissue were performed by routine
methods.
The technique for the extraction of muramidase was a modification of the
methocl described by Cohn and Hirsch(9). Each organ was rinsed in cold normal
saline and weighed. Aliquiots from representative portions of each organ were
place(l in 0.40 MI sucrose. For bone marrow determinations, identical lengths of
femur were fluslhed repeatedly with known volumes of sucrose solution. The
organs were lhomogenized and pH shocked with acetic and hydroclhloric acids to
pH 2 and then returned to pH 5.5-6.0 with sodium hydroxidle solution. After
brief centrifuLgation, the suipernatant factions were assayedl for enzyme activity.
Serum and urine samples were assayed directly. All assays were performed on
lysoplates using the technique of Osserman and Lawlor(10). Furtlher purified
amorphous muramidase for standards was obtained by bentonite extraction and
dialysis(I 1).
Using lysoplate assay techniqIue, colinear straight lines were obtained when the
logarithm of purified rat organ muramidase or human monocytic leukemic
urinary muramidase activity was plotted against the diameter of lytic zones in
agarose gels containing Micrococcuis lysodcikticnis, a substrate of mturamidase.
Standards were obtained from muiramidase purified from urinie of patients with
monocytic leukemia. This was compared on a weight-for-weight basis with mura-
midase of similar purity of rat tissue origin and the enzymes from the two species
were shown to lhave equivalent activity at all concentrations. Therefore, the more
plentiful human muramidase was substituted for standards for all the studies.
Egg wlhite muramidase was several times less active oIn a weight-for-weight basis
than either of the mammalian enzymes.

MURAMIDASE DISTRIBUTION
RESULTS
Table 1 shiows the muramidase concentration and total content of various rat
organs. It canl be seen that lung, kidney, spleen, and bone marrow are the most
active. Large and small intestine, adrenal, salivary gland, and liver are in the
intermediate range. Heart, muscle, fat, and brain lhave appreciably smaller en-
zyme concentrations. The average total white cell count in these animals was
16,850/mM3, and the absoltute granulocyte count was 5280/mM3. Total murami-
(lase distribution by organ is shown in Fig. 1. Gut, kidney, bone marrow, and
lung account for about 75% of the total. It also is apparent that serum murami-
dase is, quantitatively speaking, an insignificant part of the total animal
muramidase pool.
Direct assay of totally homogenized rats revealed 45.0 mg of rat kidney mura-
midase (RKM) equivalents/300-g male rat. liis represented an average of 150-g
RKNI equivalents per gram of rat tissue. Total animal muramidase calculated on
the basis of the sum of individual organ and tissue activities was 46.5 mg RKM
equiivalents, a figure in good agreement with that obtained by direct total animal
assay.
Rats treated with nitrogen mustard demonstrated three types of change in
muramidase activity (Fig. 2 and Table 2). The most frequent change was a pro-
gressive decrease in organ muramidase activity (luring the 3 to 4 postinjection

days followed by rapid recovery. This general pattern, with a few minor excep-
tions, was characteristic of spleen, kidney, intestine, fat, brain, heart, liver, and
adrenal. Serum muramidase activity increased during the first 12 h, but then fell
sharply during the next 3 days. Absolute granulocyte counts dropped to 12% of
normal during Days 4 and 5 after nitrogen mustard, after which there was rapid
recovery. Histologic examination of splenic tissue demonstrated marked hypo-
cellularity on Days 2 through 5 after treatment. Kidney muramidase activity
tended to fall more slowly, but the ultimate decrease was comparable to that of
most other organs. No alterations in microscopic structure were noted. There was

and 3).
DISCUSSION
In general, the distribution of tissue muramidase in the rat reported here is in
reasonable agreement with the results of Suu(12), Speece(13), and Perri(14). The
magnitude of the tissue enzyme concentrations, however, are different in this
study ciue to tlifferences in extraction techniques and the use of rat kidney mura-
midase standarclization of the reported tissue enzyme concentrations, rather
than egg white muramidase. By both lysoplate and turbidimetric methods it has
been shown that egg white muramidlase and mammalian muramidase have very
different activities. Furthermore, in both types of assay procedure, differences in
activity were noted in a fixed ratio but varied with the initial concentration.
The reasons for this are not clear but cast some doubt on the quantitative validity
of previous mammalian stutdies whiclh used egg white muramidase as standards
of assay. In the population of rats studied, the total white cell counts anti dif-
ferential cell counts agreed well with known literature values(15) suggesting the
presence of normal leukokinetics. It is also clear that the muramidase which was
assayed within tissues could not represent serum contamination since microgramis
of enzyme per gram of tissue exceeded serum levels in almost all organs. Thus,
serum contamination would serve to lower average muramidase content per gram
of tissue.
The effects of nitrogen mustard in the experimental animal have been well
documented(16). Generally, there is a rapid lymphocytopenia which lasts 5 days
to 2 weeks. Soon after the administration of nitrogen mustard intravenously, a
transient granulocytosis is followed by a profound granulocytopenia with gradual
recovery over a 5- to 7-day period if the animal survives. In the present studies,
after treatment with nitrogen mustard, a marked but very brief lymphocytosis
was noted, after which granulocyte and lymphocyte counts were depressed. It is
not surprising that during the early period of granulocytopenia during which
time there is a period of considerable injury to mature leukocytes, there is a
transient rise in serum muramidase. This is consistent with the findings of
Kerby(17) and Fink(6), who showed that in vivo leukocyte injury resulted in
transient elevations in serum muramidase levels. Urine assays during this period
failed to reveal the presence of any muramidase.
These results suggest that serum muramidase levels are a reflection of the de-
gree of active granulocytopoiesis, and that organ muramidase levels may reflect
the granulocyte mass within the organ. For example, most animals treated with
nitrogen mustard develop the picture of an acute exudative pneumonia with in-
filtration of numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Lungs assayed for mura-
midase during this period are richer in muramidase than normal controls at a
time when most organs have less than 50% of the normal muramidase con-
tent(16). Examination of the relative time course of serum, kidney, and other
organ muramidase change versus alterations in granulocyte count provided fur-
468
MIURAMIDASE DISTRIBUTION
tlher eviclence for this relation. Peripheral blood granulocyte counts fell rapidly
and reaclhed very low levels before serum and organ muramidase activities began
to fall. With the exception of the salivary gland the decline in organ muramidase
had a time sequence change similar to that observed for tissue granulocyte deple-
tion after nitrogen mtustard(16). WVhether these enzyme activity reductions repre-
sented a drop in the numbers of macrophages or granuilocytes contained within
these tissues or simply a loss of muramidase from the parenchyma of the tissue
cannot be stated by simple histologic examination alone. Indirect evidence at the
present time, however, strongly favors leukocytes as the major source of mura-
midase for most tissues of the body. Finally, chronologically, kidney muramidase
levels declined most slowly, though eventually reaching very low levels as com-
pared with controls. This delay is consistent with the role of the kidney as an
excretory organ. Recovery of renal muramidase levels appeared to be delayed
until after the return of serum levels toward normal.
It was interesting to note that serum muramidase began to return to normal
values before the reappearance of circulating granulocytes(6). This suggests that
proliferating granulocytes in the bone marrow may release muramidase. A pre-
liminary study of quantitative variations of muramidase within bone marrow of
rats treated with nitrogen mustar(d was undertaken. It revealed normal or elevatecl
muramidase levels in marrow for all but the second and third day after treatment
when there was a modest reduction in muramidase content. This seems to indi-
cate that ineffective granulopoiesis in the marrow before the release of cells into
the circulating pool of granulocytes, accompanied by normal marrow muramidase
levels, may explain the early recovery of serum muramidase.
As shown in the results section, salivary gland showed no significant decrease in
muramidase content during the course of treatment with nitrogen mustard. In
addition, adrenal gland showed only very small decreases in muramidase and in
some cases there were modest increases. It has long been known that saliva is a
riclh source of muramidase(18). The enzyme may either be elaborated by the
salivary glands or concentrated from the serum and then excreted. Recently it
has been demonstrated that tear muramidase is not derived from blood leukocytes
and that lacrimal gland muramidase production probably is entirely indepen-
dent(19). This study provides strong evidence that the production of muramidase
in salivary glands also may be autonomous.
In general, data from the nitrogen mustard studies described suggests that
variations in serum and organ muramidase are temporally and causally related
to variations in leukokinetics, with the exceptions described above. Serum mura-
midase is a reasonable mirror of changes in total body muramidase stores in the
rat. The rapid (lisappearance and return of a major portion of the body's total
muramidase is consistent with a recent report of a serum T1,2 of less than 2 h(20).
SUMMARY
Studies of muramidase distribution in the rat revealed that bone marrow,
kidney, spleen, and lung were the richest sources of enzyme followed by salivary
gland, intestine, adrenal, and liver. Serum levels were lower than those of most

organs and quantitatively represented but 10% of the total animal lysozyme pool
at any one moment. Nitrogen mustard depressed serum and organ muramidase
levels in most tissues in proportion to reduction in the number of circulating
granulocytes. The exception of salivary gland to this relationship suggests that
its production of muramidase is autonomous. Serum muramidase was found to
be an accurate mirror of clhanges in total body muramidase stores.
