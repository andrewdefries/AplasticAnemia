Background/Aims: The distribution of blood lipids, glucose
and their determinants in thalassemic patients with chronic
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has rarely been investigated.
Thus, we aimed to investigate the relationship between both
liver histologic ﬁndings and viral markers and serum lipids in
thalassemic patients chronically infected with HCV. Methods:
We enrolled 280 polytransfused thalassemic patients with
chronic hepatitis C. HCV viral load was determined using the
Amplicor test. Genotyping was performed using genotype
speciﬁc primers. Fasting serum lipid, glucose, ferritin and liv-
er function enzyme concentrations were measured. A modi-
ﬁed Knodell scoring system was used to stage liver ﬁbrosis
and to grade necroinﬂammatory activity. Perls’ staining was
used to assess hepatic siderosis. Results: Just one subject
had total cholesterol >200 mg/dL, and 7% had triglycerides
>150 mg/dL. The mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C) and glucose levels were 37 and 104 (97-111) mg/
dL, respectively. Viral markers, liver histological ﬁndings and
aminotransferase activity were not associated with serum
lipid levels. Serum triglycerides, total cholesterol and ferritin
were independent risk factors for impaired glucose tolerance
or diabetes in these patients. Conclusions: The majority of
the patients had blood lipid levels (with the exception of HDL)
within the deﬁned normal range; viral and liver histological
factors do not appear to play a significant role in changing
the levels of serum lipids or glucose in these patients. (Gut

INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis C is a major health problem in the world,1
for which
thalassemia patients are at a higher risk.2
Metabolic syndrome is
a risk factor for progression of liver diseases as well. As the liver
is the main determinant of serum lipoprotein synthesis and lipid
metabolism, chronic liver diseases are often accompanied with
an impaired lipid metabolism.3
The relation between low levels
of serum cholesterol, particularly low-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol (LDL-C) and severity of liver disease has previously been
described.4
Lower total cholesterol and LDL-C levels were also
described in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients.5,6
Total se-
rum cholesterol and LDL-C have even been proposed to be pre-
dictors of response to interferon in HCV infected patients.7
Fur-
thermore, it was determined that patients with chronic hepatitis
C had lower total cholesterol levels in comparison with patients
chronically infected with hepatitis B.8
An association between
HCV infection and lipid metabolism has been described as well.
Bonding of HCV to VLDL or LDL could facilitate its entry via the
LDL receptor.9-11
These findings suggest that plasma lipids play
an important role in the pathogenesis of HCV infection. Major
beta-thalassemic patients are the most affected group of pa-
tients chronically infected with HCV. It is well known that beta-
thalassemia is associated with changes in plasma lipids. A low
total cholesterol levels caused by a significant decrease in both
LDL-C and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) have
been described previously in beta-thalassemia,12
but findings for
triglycerides were heterogeneous.13,14
In spite of the possible role
of serum lipids in pathogenesis of HCV infection and implica-
tion of liver disease caused by hypertransfusion in thalassemic
patients, data regarding the distribution of blood lipids among
thalassemic patients with chronic HCV infection are lacking.
Alavian SM, et al: Lipid Profiles and Hepatitis C Viral Markers in HCV-Infected Thalassemic Patients 349
Therefore, in this study we aimed to investigate the distribution
of serum lipids in beta-thalassemic patients with chronic HCV
infection, and to determine if there are any correlations between
serum lipid levels and viral load, HCV genotype, liver histology
and serum iron.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
1. Study design
This study was designed as an observational study to investi-
gate lipid and glucose levels and their relation with viral mark-
ers and liver histologic findings in 280 HCV infected major-
thalassemic patients.
2. Patients
From a total of three hundred thalassemia patients with es-
tablished diagnosis of chronic HCV (positive polymerase chain
reaction [PCR] for the last 6 months and liver histologic pattern
of chronic hepatitis), 280 were enrolled in the present study.
Twenty patients refused to participate or went to other centers
to start treatment. Among all patients, 269 (96.1%) were major
thalassemic patients receiving regular blood transfusions at 2-
to 4-week intervals to maintain the level of hemoglobin at 10-
13 g/dL along with regular therapy with deferoxamine while 11
(3.9%) had thalassemia-intermedia and received hydroxyurea
and blood transfusion at long intervals. Informed consent has
been obtained from patients at registration time. Sixty-seven
subjects with previous liver biopsies performed more than four
years ago refused to undergo another liver biopsy. Thus, their
liver histologic findings were considered missing.
3. Laboratory assessment
Serum lipid and glucose concentration were determined after
an overnight fast of 12 and 9 hours respectively. Alanine ami-
notransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline
phosphatase (ALP), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were detected
using ELISA. Serum ferritin concentration was measured by
applying IRMA. Triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL-C, and
LDL-C were measured enzymatically with commercial kits and
automated analyzer. LDL-C was calculated using the Friedwald
formula: (total cholesterol)-(HDL-C)-1/5(triglycerides).15
The
body mass index (BMI) was calculated in accordance with the
formula of weight (kg) divided by height2
(m2
).16
4. Deﬁnitions
Subjects with a previously established diagnosis of diabetes,
currently taking any form of insulin injections or hypoglyce-
mic drugs and/or fasting blood glucose level >126 mg/dL were
categorized as diabetes and > 110 mg/dL as significant enough
insulin resistance (impaired glucose tolerance). As well as fast-
ing blood glucose, the cut off point for triglyceride, total cho-
lesterol was set at 150 and 200 mg/dL accordingly, with respect
to World Health Organization (WHO) definition of metabolic
syndrome. HDL-C <40 for males and <50 for females were also
considered low. It is noteworthy that none of our patients were
taking lipid lowering agents. Fasting blood glucose was above
110 mg/dL in all diabetic patients.
5. Histologic evaluation
All subjects underwent percutaneous liver biopsy by Meng-
hini needles. Each biopsy specimen was evaluated according
to the modified Knodell score grading and staging system. A
scale of 0-18 (modified HAI grading) was applied for grading of
necroinflammatory activity and a scale of 0-6 (modified stag-
ing) was applied for staging of liver fibrosis and architectural
disturbances. Then, staging and grading of liver damage were
categorized into three levels of mild, moderate and severe. 0-6
for grading and 0-2 for staging were designated as mild, 7-12
and 3-4 as moderate and 13-18 and 5-6 as severe. Perls’ stain-
ing with score of 0-4 was applied to assess hepatic siderosis. 0-2
was designated as mild, 3 as moderate and 4 as severe.
6. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and PCR procedure
All PCR procedures and genotyping were performed as de-
scribed previously.17
7. Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are presented as mean values with 95%
confidence interval. However, qualitative and discrete variables
are presented as absolute and relative frequencies in the form
of percentage. Chi-square test was applied to assess associations
between categorical variables. Because of great sample size and
power, comparisons between continuous and categorical vari-
ables were performed by Student’s t-test and one-way ANOVA
regardless of considering normal distribution or homogeneity
of variances. Correlations between lipids levels and age, liver
enzymes, ferritin, glucose, viral load, and BMI were evaluated
by the calculation of Pearson’s correlation coefficient. All com-
putations were carried out using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) while the graphs were provided by Stata SE
version 8.0 (Stata Co., College Station, TX, USA). The probabil-
ity value (p) <0.05 was regarded statistically significant.
RESULTS
1. Patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics
Table 1 has summarized our subjects’ demographic and base-
line clinical characteristics. The mean age of our patients was
24 years (ranging from 11 to 54) and 59% of them were male.
Only 2 patients (0.7%) had received their first transfusion after
1996, the year in which anti-HCV screening was established in
Iran. 183 (65%) of subjects were splenectomized with mean age
of 13 years at the time of procedure. The most frequent HCV
genotypes were genotype 1 (57%) followed by 3 (35%). Fifty-
350 Gut and Liver, Vol. 5, No. 3, September 2011
three out of 280 subjects (24%) had severe liver fibrosis and 9
subjects (4%) had severe necroinflammatory. 21.1% of subjects
had normal serum ALT level.
2. Blood lipids and glucose distribution
The mean values of the investigated blood lipids and glucose
are presented in Table 2. Furthermore, Fig. 1 illustrates the dis-
tribution of total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglyceride and glu-
cose levels. Mean total cholesterol, LDL, triglyceride and glucose
varied within normal values (<200 mg/dL for total and LDL-C,
150 mg/dL for triglyceride, and 110 mg/dL for glucose). In addi-
tion, just one of the participants had total and HDL-cholesterol
levels above 200 mg/dL and only 7% of subjects had higher
than 150 mg/dL triglyceride. In contrast to above results, 151
(72%) of our subjects had low HDL-C levels (<40 mg/dL for men
and <50 mg/dL for women). In this study, 50% of men and 65%
of women with normal total cholesterol levels (i.e., <200 mg/
dL) had lower than 40 and 50 mg/dL HDL-C levels, respectively.
Mean triglyceride was also low (108 mg/dL), and 12% of men
and 18% of women had triglyceride levels higher than 150 mg/
dL. Finally, mean LDL-C level was also low (51 mg/dL) and only
one participant had LDL-C level higher than 200 mg/dL.
Thirty-nine subjects (14%) had previously established diagno-
sis of diabetes mellitus (15 males and 24 females) and 31 (79%)
of them were taking anti-hyperglycemic agents. We have found
another 9 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (>110 mg/
dL). Mean serum glucose level was 104 mg/dL (97-111) that
varied in border line and in range of impaired fasting glucose
tolerance.
It is known that age is a factor that correlates well with blood

lipids and glucose levels. In our study, using Pearson’s cor-
relation coefficient, no statistically significant association was
found between age, all blood lipids and glucose measurements.
This was true even after adjustment of sex, viral markers and
liver histologic findings. Serum ferritin was significantly as-
sociated with total cholesterol (p=0.001) and serum glucose
level (p=0.02) (Fig. 2). Patients with diabetes mellitus had higher
levels of serum ferritin than patients with normal fasting blood
glucose (2,602 vs 1,877, p=0.01).
3. Impact of liver histology and viral markers on serum lip-
ids and glucose levels
Fig. 2 has presented distribution of various serum lipids and
glucose according to ALT, serum HCV-RNA, and serum fer-
ritin. As it is visually obvious, there were no linear or curvular
relation between any of serum lipids, glucose and HCV-RNA.
Serum ferritin was only correlated with total cholesterol and
serum glucose (p=0.001 and 0.02, respectively).
Fig. 3 has depicted serum lipid and glucose levels according
to stage of liver fibrosis, necroinflammatory activity, siderosis
and infecting genotypes. It is visually evident from Fig. 3 that
there were no significant differences in serum lipids and glucose
levels. To evaluate the probable association between glucose
intolerance and stage of liver disturbances chi-square test was
used. No association was found between presence of insulin re-
sistance and stage and grade of liver disease and siderosis even
after adjustment of sex.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated the distribution of blood lipids
and glucose in a sample of Iranian beta-thalassemic major pa-
tients with chronic hepatitis C infection. To our knowledge, this
work was the largest scale study of blood lipids among these
patients. We found that nearly all of the participants had normal
total cholesterol and LDL-C levels. In contrast, a considerable
proportion of our patients had very low HDL-C levels. We also
showed that there was no correlation between serum HCV-RNA
copies, HCV genotypes, aminotransferase activities and blood
lipids and glucose in thalassemic patients. Only serum ferritin
correlated with total cholesterol and serum glucose (p=0.001
and 0.02, respectively).

level of total cholesterol. A recent report from Azizi et al.18
which enrolled healthy children and adolescents from Iran has
suggested that 16% of males and females at our patients’ ages
had high total cholesterol. According to the previous studies, it
is known that patients with beta-thalassemia major have lower
total cholesterol levels compared with healthy individuals of
the same age.19
Based on the previous findings in thalassemic
patients, we also observed low mean LDL-C levels in our sub-
jects. It is of interest that just three subjects had higher than 95
mg/dL LDL-C levels. On the contrary, Azizi et al.18
reported that
17% of males and females with ages similar to our patients had
above 130 mg/dL levels of LDL-C. Mean triglyceride was also
low in our patients. Nineteen (7%) participants had triglyceride
levels of higher than 150 mg/dL. In our study, thalassemic men
had higher total cholesterol and LDL-C than thalassemic women
(p=0.001 and 0.02). This is reciprocal to Azizi et al.’s findings
in healthy children and adolescents18
and others.20
The majority
of our participants had very low HDL-C levels. It has previously
been described that low HDL-C is the most common type of
dyslipidemia in Iranian healthy adults.21
Hypocholesterolemia as
well as low serum concentration of other lipids have been ex-
plained in various chronic anemic disorders such as thalassemia
major, thalassemia intermedia and aplastic anemia.22-24
Several
mechanisms including plasma dilution resulting from anemia,
increased cholesterol requirement associated with erythroid hy-
perplasia, macrophage system activation with cytokine release,

354 Gut and Liver, Vol. 5, No. 3, September 2011
increased cholesterol uptake by the reticuloendotial system, and
liver injury secondary to iron overload have been proposed.25
In
our study, we showed that chronic HCV infection does not alter
pattern of serum lipids in thalassemic patients.
Forty-eight subjects (18%) had previous established diagnosis
of diabetes mellitus or had impaired glucose tolerance in our
study. Ghoddusi et al.26
and Hadaegh et al.27
previously reported
the prevalence of diabetes in Iranian general population to be
around 11.0%.26
Since we did not have control group, apply-
ing binomial test showed glucose intolerance in our study to be
significantly higher than what was reported in Iranian general
population (p=0.001). Serum total cholesterol and triglyceride
were significantly higher in subjects with serum glucose >110
mg/dL (p=0.02 and 0.006, respectively) which was similar to
what Ghoddusi et al. have described in diabetic patients.26,27
It
is determined that thalassemic patients had significantly higher
insulin resistance than healthy controls.28
Dmochowski et al.28
have also explained that decreased hepatic extraction of insulin,
but not higher excretion of pancreas beta-cells, is responsible
for higher serum insulin level in thalassemic patients. Reduction
in capability of liver to extract serum insulin as a result of in-
flammation and fibrosis caused by HCV infection and resultant
higher serum insulin as well as low age of our subjects can ex-
plain our findings. We also indicated that distribution of mean
serum fasting blood glucose in our participants is in border line
of impaired tolerance. Hence, thalassemic patients with HCV
infection may have very high rate of diabetes mellitus in 3rd or
4th decades of their lives. We also showed that serum glucose is
significantly correlated with serum iron, and more effective iron
chelation therapy in these patients can avert or postpone devel-
opment of diabetes mellitus.
2. Implication of chronic HCV infection on serum lipids and
glucose of thalassemic patients
In non-thalassemic HCV infected patients, it has previously
been explained that there are association among metabolic
syndrome, serum level of glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride and
ALT levels as well as HCV viral load and genotype 1 and 2.29,30
Petit et al.31
have also described a correlation between hypo-
betalipoproteinemia and liver fibrosis and viral load. Maeno et
al.32
by applying insulin homeostasis assessment model on 56
non-thalassemic HCV infected subjects revealed that insulin
resistance increased parallel with the progression of fibrosis. As
presented in Figs. 2 and 3, in spite of enough sample size, we
could not find any significant association of serum lipids and
glucose with liver histologic findings, aminotransferase activity
as well as serum HCV-RNA and HCV genotype in thalassemic
patients with HCV infection.32
Siagris et al.3
have also revealed
that steatosis in HCV infected thalassemic patients is lower than
HCV infected patients.
We showed that in our thalassemic patients, serum glucose
is not significantly associated with liver fibrosis, necroinflam-
matory and aminotransferase activities as well as virologic
markers such as genotype and HCV-RNA. Genotype 2 had the
highest mean blood glucose level. However, this difference was
not significant applying one-way ANOVA. Serum glucose level
had an increasing trend toward higher degrees of fibrosis and
lower degrees of inflammation. This trend was not statistically
significant (Fig. 3). Previously, it has been discovered that HCV
infection in absence of liver cirrhosis can induce insulin resis-
tance and liver iron deposition and TNF-alpha was introduced
as culprit mechanisms.33,34
In our study on thalassemic patients,
serum glucose was not different between various grades of liver
siderosis, but it significantly correlated with serum ferritin. This
implies that iron can cause peripheral insulin resistance besides
hepatic injury reported in other studies.33,35
To our knowledge,
relation of serum glucose and insulin resistance with HCV viral
markers is not well understood. In thalassemic patients we could
not find any relation either. However, this issue needs more mo-
lecular and clinical investigations.
The present study revealed that HCV infected patients with
beta-thalassemia major have blood lipid and lipoprotein levels
within the normal range. An exception is the observed very low
HDL -C levels. Viral markers, liver histologic findings as well
as liver enzymes do not seem to play any role in determining
serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in thalassemic patients.
Serum triglyceride, total cholesterol and serum iron can be in-
dependent risk factors of glucose intolerance in HCV infected
thalassemic patients.
