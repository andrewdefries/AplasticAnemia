Abstract
Introduction: A brain abscess is a focal, intracerebral infection that begins as a localized area of
cerebritis and develops into a collection of pus surrounded by a well-vascularized capsule.
Case presentation: An 18 year old male was diagnosed to have culture-negative bilateral subdural
empyema, which was drained and the patient was discharged, only to return 3 months later with a left
temporo-parietal abscess that was drained and continued to show no growth on cultures and was
non-responsive to multiple antibiotics. As a final effort, chloramphenicol therapy was begun and the
patient showed immediate improvement and made a relatively uneventful recovery.
Conclusion: Chloramphenicol is an antimicrobial agent used rarely today in the United States
because of its associated adverse effects. But the fact remains, that it is a broad-spectrum agent that is
highly effective against many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, spirochetes, chlamydiae, and
rickettsia. Due to its ability to achieve high concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid we would advise
it as second line therapy for culture negative brain abscesses.
Introduction
Intracranial abscesses are a life-threatening condition, and
include brain abscess, subdural empyema and intracranial
epidural abscess. A brain abscess is a focal, intracerebral
infection that begins as a localized area of cerebritis and
develops into a collection of pus surrounded by a well-
vascularized capsule [1]. Most brain abscesses are caused by
injury or local infection, or by a focus of infection in a
contiguous structure (40-50%) [2,3]. Brain abscesses can
also be caused by hematogenous or metastatic spread from a
distant focus of infection (25%) or can be cryptogenic
(15%). Fever, headache, altered consciousness, and hemi-
paresis are the most common manifestations [4]. Treatment
of brain abscess requires a combination of antimicrobials,
surgical intervention, and eradication of primary infected
foci. We describe a case of a multi-antibiotic resistant
brain abscess that was found to be sensitive only to
chloramphenicol.
Case presentation
An 18-year-old Arab male from Saudi Arabia, presented
with headache and vomiting. The patient was irritable,

confused, and febrile. He had neck rigidity and left sided
hemiplegia. Investigations revealed a high white blood
cell count. CT scan and MRI of brain showed extensive
subdural collection of pus bilaterally, more so on the right
side.
Subdural empyema was drained through bilateral burr
holes. Patient received metronidazole and ceftriaxone. Pus
was cultured but showed no growth even after 21 days. The
patient’s condition improved and he was discharged after
3 weeks.
Three months later he was brought to the Emergency
Room with headache and altered sensorium. CT scan of
brain with contrast showed a ring enhancing lesion in
the left temporo-parietal region. Keeping in view his past
history and radiological features of the lesion, a diagnosis
of cerebral abscess was made. The abscess was approached
through a burr hole and thick yellow pus was aspirated. A
drain was left in the abscess cavity. As before, there was no
growth on bacterial or fungal cultures.
Cefotaxime, penicillin and metronidazole were given,
but fever and neck stiffness persisted. After twelve days,
antibiotics were changed to metronidazole, vancomycin
and amikacin. The patient continued to deteriorate and a
week later ceftazidime and teicoplanin therapy was begun,
without any improvement.
After five days, intravenous chloramphenicol was given for
three days and then orally for another four days, after which
no more chloramphenicol was available at our institution.
Following this short course of chloramphenicol therapy,
the patient’s fever subsided, WBC count returned to
normal, and there were clear signs of clinical improvement.
CT scan was repeated and showed resolution of abscess
cavity.
The patient continued to improve and became conscious.
He became mobile and was discharged after a total of three
months in-hospital stay. A follow up in clinic three weeks
later, showed almost complete neurological recovery with
mild weakness on right side and a slight limp on walking.
Conclusion
Despitetheadventofmodernneurosurgicaltechniques,new
antibiotics, and new powerful imaging technologies, brain
abscess remains a potentially fatal central nervous system
infection. Studies have shown that penicillin, ampicillin,
cefuroxime,chloramphenicol,rifampicin,trimethoprim,co-
trimoxazole, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, clindamycin and
metronidazole, all achieve therapeutic concentrations in
brain tissue and intracranial pus [1,4]. The antibiotics of
choice to be used empirically are crystalline penicillin,
chloramphenicol, and metronidazole, followed by
definitive therapy based on the sensitivity pattern of the
causative organisms. There is a recent trend toward the
avoidance of chloramphenicol [1]. Chloramphenicol is an
antimicrobial agent used rarely today in the United States
because of its associated adverse effects, particularly idiosyn-
cratic aplastic anemia. At one time it was hailed as a broad
spectrum agent highly effective against many gram-positive
and gram-negative bacteria, spirochetes, chlamydiae, and
rickettsia. Chloramphenicol had a major role in the
treatment of meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae,
Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis because
of its bactericidal activity against these organisms and the
ability to achieve high concentrations in the cerebrospinal
fluid [5].
Chloramphenicol continues to play a major role in the
treatment of serious infections in developing countries
and may be of great therapeutic benefit for the manage-
ment of life-threatening drug-resistant infections or in
persons who are allergic to penicillin [6]. It is important,
therefore, that we reacquaint ourselves with this potent
antimicrobial. We report this case as chloramphenicol,
despite its potential side-effects, can potentially be a highly
useful antibiotic in brain infections when cultures are
negative and identification of the offending pathogen
becomes difficult, and other antimicrobials have failed.
Due to its ability to achieve high concentrations in the
cerebrospinal fluid and potent bactericidal activity against
a myriad of organisms we would advise it as second line
therapy for culture negative brain abscesses.
