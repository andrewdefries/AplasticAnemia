Various Effects of Arsenic in Japan
Depending on Type of Exposure
by Kenzaburo Tsuchiya*
Since 1955, a number of outbreaks of arsenic poisoning have occurred throughout Japan among
industrial workers and the general population. The sources and types of exposure differ according to the
incident, and the victims vary in sex and age. These incidents include arsenic poisoning in milk, soy sauce,
and well water, pollution originating from the Toroku Mine on the island of Kyushu, the Matsuo Mine in
Shimane Prefecture, and Saganoseki Smelter on Kyushu. The type, routes, and dose of exposure as well
as major symptoms are given. The clinical signs and symptoms are discussed in relation to the various
types ofexposure which occurred in these incidents. Dose-response relationships will be considered where
data are available.
Arsenic Poisoning in
Powdered Milk
In early summer 1955, outbreaks of a disease
characterized by anorexia, anemia, skin rash and/or
pigmentation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever,
and bloated abdomen occurred among infants, most
of whom were less than 12 months of age. Three
infants died at the beginning of August and the
number of cases reported continued to increase. On
August 20, it was confirmed that these cases were
limited to those infants who were bottle fed. From
the clinical symptoms, heavy metal poisoning was
suspected, and arsenic was identified in Morinaga
MF powdered milk by the Department of Legal
Medicine of Okayama University. On August 24,
the sale of this milk was banned. Extensive inves-
tigation and examinations of bottle-fed infants were
carried out in the western part of Japan where the
milk had been distributed. As a result of these in-
vestigations, the Ministry of Health and Welfare on
June 9, 1956, announced a total of 12,131 victims,
including 130 fatalities. An extensive review of this
incident has been published by the Okayama pre-
fectural government (1).
The route of arsenic contamination was as fol-
lows: One plant of the Morinaga Milk Company
located in the city of Tokushima on the island of
*Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.
Shikoku added sodium phosphate to the milk as a
stabilizer. This sodium phosphate is a by-product of
the process in which aluminum is produced from
bauxite. This by-product consists of approximately
45% crystal water, 14% P205, 28% Na2O, 2% V205,
and 6% As205. This by-product was recrystallized
by another company which failed to completely re-
move the arsenic. The chemical formula of the
compound found in the milk was later identified as:
2Na3 (PO.} * AsO., VO.I) * NaF * 18H20, in which
arsenic was pentavalent. The final product of MF
milk contained 21-34 ug arsenic per gram; the con-
centration of arsenic differed by lot number. The
first poisoned milk was produced on April 12, 1955
and the final contaminated lot on August 13 of the
same year. Some lots produced within the same
period contained no arsenic, so it is difficult to esti-
mate just how much arsenic was ingested in each
case, but it is assumed that a total of 2.5 mg arsenic
was ingested by an infant one month old, 3.2 mg by
those 2 months old, and 4.6 mg by those 6 months
old. The poisoned infants were treated by BAL and
other therapy. Although 130 infants died, the symp-
toms disappeared in the infants who survived. In
June 1956 health examinations were conducted on
the survivors, and it was diagnosed that most of the
infants suffered no abnormality (2). It seemed that
the incident had concluded.
However, 13 years later, a group of nurses,
schoolteachers, and medical students visited the
August 1977 35
families of the survivors and provoked discussion
among scientists concerning the residual effects on
those who had been poisoned in infancy. The
nurses, teachers, and medical students reported
that residual effects did exist. The reports from this
time on become very complicated as politics and
public opinion entered the picture.
More than 200 papers, including oral presenta-
tions in medical conferences, on clinical signs and
symptoms and autopsy findings were reported in
the period from 1955 to 1975. The main acute symp-
toms were fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia.
Another characteristic symptom was melanosis.
Miyata, Kosho, and Nagai (3) reported that the
liver could be felt in most cases. Blood tests showed
slight anemia, leucopenia, relative lymphocytosis,
and leuconeutrophilia. However, no symptoms of
the cerebral nervous system or the circulatory sys-
tem were noted.
Other clinical symptoms as reported by
Hamamoto (4) are shown in Table 1. According to
Hamamoto, other reports of arsenic poisoning such
as the beer poisoning incident in Manchester, Eng-
land, had not cited fever, but in the Morinaga milk
incident, fever was present in most cases. Further-
more, in the Morinaga incident, symptoms of
neuritis were not observed. Even electromyelo-
grams indicated no symptoms of the peripheral ner-
vous system. Hamamoto mentions that the most
remarkable effect of BAL treatment was the rapid
gain in body weight. With regard to dose-response
relationship, Hamamoto estimated that infants 3
months old or over developed symptoms after in-
gesting 90-140 mg arsenic oxide.
Fourteen years after the poisoning occurred, a
series of follow-up studies were performed by
groups of university researchers and practicing
physicians. A great number of symptoms were
noted in the children who had ingested the poisoned
milk. However, all the records had not been kept
over the 14 years. Other problems also complicated
the investigations, as it appears that some parents
desiring compensation indicated that their child had
been poisoned, where in actuality he or she had not,
and some other parents whose child had actually
ingested the contaminated milk denied the fact for
various personal reasons.
There are a number of reports on the youngsters
who ingested the contaminated milk in infancy. The
following discussion is based mainly on reports by
Toyoshima and Sumi (5), Yamasaki et al. (6), Ohira
and Aoyama (7), Yuwasa (8), Kawatsu et al. (9),
Ohtori, Tsukamoto, and Bessho (10), and Nishida
(I1). Some of these studies discuss the relationship
between arsenic poisoning and symptoms. It is not
my intention here to discuss the cause-effect rela-

tionship of arsenic and these symptoms. One point
I do wish to discuss is the possible effect of arsenic
on the central nervous system, e.g., the paper by
Ohira and Aoyama (7) reported the results of elec-
troencephalograms as shown in Table 2. This table
indicates a statistically significant difference in ab-
normal findings between the breast-fed group of in-
fants and the Morinaga milk group. However, it is
difficult to conclude from this study alone that arse-
nic was actually the cause of effects on the central
nervous system because the number of cases of ab-
normal findings are too few. In his report in 1955,
Hamamoto (4) found only four cases of en-
cephalopathy (with convulsions) out of the 61 who
suffered acute poisoning. It seems that these symp-
toms were caused by the inflammation of the cere-
bral membrane and not by disturbance to the cere-
bral parenchyma itself. Yuwasa (8) in 1970 and 1971
reported higher prevalence of epilepsy among the
arsenic-poisoned children than in control children.
Tamura et al. (12) examined whether or not arse-
nic is transferred into the brain through the blood-
brain barrier in animal experiments and found that
arsenic in the brain and liver did not increase after 2
weeks of oral administration of arsenic in milk,
whereas the content in the kidney increased. In this
experiment 650 ppm As203 in milk was adminis-
tered over a period of 35 days.
Tsutusmi (13) gave rats, mice, and rabbits sodium
arsenate radioisotope by forced oral administration
and reported the intake of arsenic by the brain. In
rabbits the intake by the brain was lower than that
by the other organs. In rats the brain intake was the
second lowest after nails. In mice, however, it was
the third highest, after the liver and kidney. The
transfer of arsenic to the brain through the blood-
brain barrier is an important subject for investiga-
tion in future studies.
Soy Sauce Poisoning
In 1956 approximately 400 persons ingested soy
sauce contaminated by arsenic in Ube, a city in
western Japan. Of these, 220 were examined by
Mizuta (14). After two days of ingestion of the soy
sauce, many victims developed edema and gastro-
intestinal symptoms followed by skin changes and
later by symptoms of the peripheral nervous system
(Fig. 1). Even though the ingestion of the contami-
nated soy sauce continued, the symptoms
weakened after 5 to 6 days. The symptoms disap-
peared two weeks after cessation of exposure.
Polyneuritis appeared in the third to fourth week of
exposure. The liver was swollen and abnormal
EKG findings were noted in 80% of those persons
examined. (In the Morinaga incident, only about
40% showed abnormal EKGs.) Abnormal knee
jerks developed remarkably after two weeks of ex-
posure. As for eye symptoms, conjunctivitis, cen-
tral scotoma, and retinitis of the optical nerve were
observed. Many of the victims showed anemia with
leucopenia, relative lymphocytosis, and basophilic
headache eye discharge n=50

stippled red cells. No remarkable changes were
noted in the bone marrow picture. Occult blood was
noted in feces, stomach and duodenal juice. In-
creased excretion of arsenic in urine was noted two
weeks after cessation of exposure. The duration of
ingestion of contaminated soy sauce was 2-3 weeks.
The arsenic concentration was 90-100 ,ug/ml. There
was no fatality in this incident.
Well Water Poisoning
In 1959, about 60 cases of arsenic poisoning were
identified by the Department of Dermatology,
Niigata University School of Medicine. The source
was found to be well water. In the town of Nakajo,
Niigata Prefecture, there was a plant which had
been producing arsenic sulfide for over 100 years.
FIGURE 2. As concentrations in well water by distance from
factory
Waste water from the factory contaminated the
well water drunk by inhabitants living near the fac-
tory. A number of the wells were connected to each
other by ground water. The higher concentrations
were evident in those wells closest to the factory,
and the concentrations decreased with distance
from the factory. It is important in terms of dose-
response relationship to note that all 60 cases of
arsenic poisoning were clustered within a distance
of 400 meters from the factory where the concentra-
tions were 0.05 ppm and over (Fig. 2). As levels in
water from many of the wells in this area exceeded
1-2 ppm, with a maximum of 3 ppm. The patients
complained of fatigue and some had fever. How-
ever, the most important chronic symptoms were
skin changes, including keratosis, melanosis, scal-
ing, and leucoderma. The actual number poisoned
as determined by clinical symptoms was 60, but 90
were suspected cases, and of the 90, 48% showed
anemia, 30% showed swollen liver, and fewer
showed abnormal EKGs, proteinuria, accelerated
knee reflex, pallor, joint pain, swelling of the lymph
nodes, swelling of the spleen, and jaundice (16).
Terada et al. (17) discussed the nature of the
anemia observed in many cases and 50% of the pa-
tients with anemia showed normochromic anemia
and 30% showed hyperchromic anemia. There was
no significant decrease of serum ion in those victims
with leucopenia. Terada et al. concluded that the
anemia observed resembled aplastic anemia. How-
ever, bone marrow pictures showed stimulation of
the red cell system, thus contradicting the picture of
aplastic anemia.
Another important finding in this study was that
there was no relationship between skin symptoms
and arsenic levels in hair, i.e., one case showed no
skin symptoms, although arsenic level in hair
showed 77 ppm, while another case showed ad-
vanced skin symptoms with arsenic level in hair of
less than 5 ppm. It should also be pointed out that
no case of cancer was reported in this incident.
Toroku Mine Incident
Toroku is a small village in the southern part of
the island of Kyushu with a total population of less
than 300. There is a mine located there which pro-
duced arsenic oxide until operations ceased about
15 years ago. In 1971, a schoolteacher raised the
question that health of school children in the town
may have been affected in the past by air pollution
by sulfur dioxide and arsenic. The prefectural gov-
ernment began epidemiological investigations that
same year with the cooperation of the medical
community in the area. According to the investiga-

tion of the environment, food and water were found
not to be contaminated by arsenic, but a survey of
the dust collected from ceiling boards in private
homes showed high concentrations of arsenic in
those homes which were located close to the roast-
ing furnace of the smelter. From this it was con-
cluded that while the factory was in operation, there
did exist pollution by arsenic as well as by sulfur
dioxide. A total of 24 persons living near the mine
showed pigmentation, leucoderma, and/or hyper-
keratosis of the skin, which were assumed to have
been caused by arsenic. However, a problem ex-
ists, in that some of those who showed skin changes
worked for the mining company on a part-time
basis, bringing ore and roasting it in their own
homes. It was difficult to distinguish those who had
practiced such work and those who had not, since
for personal reasons, many did not wish to indicate
the fact to investigators. However, as shown in Ta-
bles 3 and 4 it is evident that there exists a relation-
ship between the prevalence of skin changes and
distance from the smelter (18). The relationship be-
tween the two factors becomes more evident when
those with confirmed occupational exposure are
excluded, as shown in Table 5.
leucoderma with one case of Bowen's disease. In
the past medical histories of those persons, inci-
dences of respiratory disease as well as of eye dis-
eases were slightly higher than those of control sub-
jects. A few cases of lung cancer were noted among
inhabitants and occupationally exposed workers,
which may possibly be related to the exposure to
arsenic as well as to sulfur dioxide. However, the
number of cases of lung cancer was too small to
confirm the existence of a relationship.
Sasagadani Mine Incident
The Sasagadani mine located in Shimane Prefec-
ture in western Japan which produced copper and
arsenic trioxide started operations about 700 years
ago and was closed down in 1949 due to insufficient
production. Several rivers flow from the area near
the mine, and the occurrence ofagricultural damage
was noticed as early as 1884. In 1950, four dams
were constructed as a countermeasure against such
damage. The hamlet closest to the mine was located
about 1-2 km from the mine, so air pollution
originating from the mine was most likely very
slight. Extensive investigations of the environment,

The characteristics of exposure and effects in this
area were as follow. The route of exposure was via
the respiratory system. Chemical substances were
not only As203 but also SO2 from the stack, al-
though the smelter closed down before determina-
tions could be made as to just how much. The in-
habitants, particularly those living near the smelter,
had been exposed to those chemicals, but some of
them had been exposed occupationally on either a
full or part-time basis and the effects included
mainly skin changes, such as pigmentation or
particularly drinking water and house dust, and
health examinations were performed on about 1000
inhabitants in 1970. Health examinations were con-
ducted by the Tottori University School of
Medicine (19, 20). Arsenic concentrations in drink-
ing water of 200 families living within a 7-km radius
of the mine were checked. The highest concentra-
tion found was 0.125 ppm in the well water of one
family; 0.07 ppm was the next highest, and most
wells showed As concentrations of 0.05 ppm or
trace or nondetectable amounts. The arsenic con-
August 1977 39
centrations in vegetables consumed in the same
hamlets were determined, but most showed less
than 0.1 ppm and the majority 0.05 ppm or less.
Thus it was assumed that environmental pollution
was not very great in this area, and if it had occurred,
the route of exposure was most likely via drink-
ing water. The Tottori University Study Group de-
termined seven persons as suffering arsenic poison-
ing and five other persons as suspected of such.
However, among the seven, six persons had had a
history of working in the mine. Those with occupa-
tional exposure showed skin changes such as pig-
mentation, leucoderma or keratosis, and in one
case, lung cancer was also detected. This patient
died of lung cancer at the age of 66 years. One
person, 77 years of age without occupational ex-
posure, had hypochromic microcytic anemia fol-
lowing an operation for stomach cancer and irri-
tated seborrheic keratosis of the skin, slight
neurogenic changes, and moderate hearing loss.
Since these changes are usually seen after stomach
surgery or in aged people, there was no confirmed
evidence of arsenic poisoning.
Among the five suspected cases, there were three
persons who had had no occupational exposure. Of
these, two were a married couple, the wife was sus-
pected as suffering Banti syndrome and the hus-
band was diagnosed as suffering from liver cir-
rhosis. The study group suspected these two cases
as suffering from arsenic poisoning because their
drinking water contained 0.125 ppm arsenic, and
arsenic concentrations in hair and nails of the hus-
band were rather high, i.e., 1.4 ppm and 11.1 ppm,
respectively. In the third person, a woman 46 years
of age, the study group suspected arsenic poisoning
because of increased eosinophiles in peripheral
blood, hyposensitivity of the extremities, and hear-
ing loss in the high frequency range. The arsenic
concentrations in hair and nails of this woman were
low and arsenic in drinking water was nondetecta-
ble. In this case, there were no skin changes.

trol areas, as well as among those with and without
a history of occupational exposure in the observa-
tion area. Higher prevalences of abnormal EMG
findings were observed in the observation area and
in those with occupational exposure. Abnormal
findings among control subjects were also found to
increase with age. The prevalence of abnormal
EMG findings between occupationally exposed and
nonoccupationally exposed persons was greater
among females than among males.
Most of the cases which were confirmed as suf-
fering arsenic poisoning had been occupationally
exposed, and the effects of arsenic on the general
population are not very clear. If there were effects,
they were very slight, with the exception ofthe case
of the married couple whose drinking water showed
a high concentration of arsenic. This case also indi-
cated that the relationships between arsenic poison-
ing and Banti syndrome and arsenic poisoning and
liver cirrhosis should be further investigated. Ab-
normal EMG findings or subclinical peripheral
neuropathy due to arsenic exposure should also be
closely studied in the future.
Saganoseki Copper Smelter
Incident
This incident is a case of occupational exposure.
Kuratsune et al. (21) in 1974 were the first to report
lung cancer due to arsenic exposure in Japan.
Another important aspect of this report is that high
lung cancer mortality among males was discovered
accidentally in a small town in the course of a
routine vital statistics investigation by the loral
health department (Table 5). These men had been
employees of the copper smelter. Based on this in-
formation, Kuratsune et al. performed a case-
control study which also appeared in the same re-
port in 1974.
Of a total of 19 cases of lung cancer, 11 persons
had worked in the copper smelter. It was not con-
firmed whether these persons had perforation ofthe
nasal septum, skin changes, anemia, or other typi-
cal symptoms of arsenic poisoning.
Discussion and Conclusion
In this presentation various effects due to arsenic
exposure which occurred in Japan have been de-
scribed and the dose, duration, and route of expos-
ure are summarized in Table 6. In the Morinaga
milk incident, the infants were exposed to relatively
high doses of arsenic in powdered milk and the vic-
tims developed acute symptoms of the gastrointes-
tinal tract, and in some cases, symptoms of the cen-

tral nervous system, anemia, neuropathy, car-
diovascular and skin changes, but no cancers. It is
not clear whether the symptoms of the central
nervous system were due to the stimulation of the
cerebral membrane or to organic changes of the
cerebral parenchyma. It is important to note that
the development of some possible changes of the
brain as indicated by EEG and possibly by the
higher incidence of epilepsy occurred at a later
stage-as late as 15 years after clinical changes had
disappeared. No other study has reported the de-
velopment of chronic encephalopathy among heav-
ily exposed children or adults.
Cancer or Bowen's disease due to arsenic poison-
ing among the Japanese people have not been fre-
quently reported in spite of numerous reports of
skin changes, including keratosis. It is noted that
skin cancer occurs much less frequently among the
Japanese population than among caucasian popula-
tions.
Another important question after having re-
viewed these episodes is whether arsenic is related
to the causation of liver cirrhosis. In incidences re-
ported in Japan, there is no increased prevalence of
liver cirrhosis among those exposed to arsenic. In
the Sasagadani incident, the married couple who
had been drinking water containing 0.125 ppm arse-
nic showed liver cirrhosis (the husband) and Banti
syndrome (the wife). However, since no cases of
either disease have been observed among those
who suffered heavier exposure, the relationship be-
tween these diseases and arsenic are still open to
question.
In the soy sauce incident, it was noted that the
symptoms improved even while the ingestion of the
contaminated soy sauce was still in progress. The
mechanism of this phenomenon should be further
investigated.
The report on the increased prevalence of ab-
normality of EMG findings is also of interest, since
prolongation of electric conduction velocity has
been reported in persons whose blood lead level
was lower than 70 ,ig/100 ml (22).
Since there have been no other reports on the
increased risk of lung cancer due to arsenic among
occupationally exposed workers in Japan, and also
since the induction of lung cancer by arsenic in
animal experiments has not been successful, the
direct relationship between arsenic and lung cancer
is still open to question. In the Saganoseki copper
smelter incident, attention should be drawn to the
fact that those workers of the smelter had also been
exposed rather heavily to substances other than ar-
senic, including polynuclear organic substances,
sulfur dioxide, and possibly to other chemical sub-
stances.
Future studies on arsenic poisoning are recom-
mended to include the following: (1) transfer of ar-
senic to the brain through the blood-brain barrier,
particularly in young organisms; (2) subclinical ef-
fects of arsenic in the peripheral nervous system;
(3) relationship between arsenic or co-substance
and cirrhosis or angiosarcoma of the liver; (4)
cocarcinogenic substances or mechanism of the de-
velopment oflung cancer due to arsenic; (5) adapta-
tion mechanism; (6) difference of effects by type of
inorganic compound.
