Pseudomonas aeruginosa Bacteremia in Children Over Ten
Consecutive Years: Analysis of Clinical Characteristics, Risk
Factors of Multi-drug Resistance and Clinical Outcomes
This study aimed to evaluate the clinical profiles, antibiotic susceptibility, risk factors of
multi-drug resistance (MDR) and outcomes of P. aeruginosa bacteremia in children by
retrospective methods at a tertiary teaching children’s hospital in Seoul, Korea during
2000-2009. A total of 62 episodes were evaluated and 59 patients (95.2%) had underlying
diseases. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that an intensive care unit (ICU) stay within
the previous one month was the only independent risk factor for MDR P. aeruginosa
bacteremia (odds ratio [OR], 6.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-35.8, P = 0.023). The
overall fatality rate associated with P. aeruginosa bacteremia was 14.5% (9 of 62). The
fatality rate in patients with MDR P. aeruginosa was 57.1%, compared with 9.1% in non-
MDR patients (OR 13.3; 95% CI 2.3-77.2, P = 0.006). However, the presence of
respiratory difficulty was the only independent risk factor for overall fatality associated
with P. aeruginosa bacteremia according to multivariate analysis (OR 51.0; 95% CI 7.0-
369.0, P < 0.001). A previous ICU stay and presentation with respiratory difficulty were
associated with acquisition of MDR P. aeruginosa and a higher fatality rate, respectively.
Future efforts should focus on the prevention and treatment of P. aeruginosa bacteremia
in high-risk children.

INTRODUCTION
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an aerobic Gram-negative organism
that is commonly discovered in soil, water, and plants, rarely
causes illness in healthy people (1). However, P. aeruginosa sep-
sis often occurs in patients with burns, malignancies or immu-
nodeficiency or in preterm infants (1). Most of these infections
are nosocomially acquired (1). P. aeruginosa is a virulent organ-
ism that is susceptible to a limited number of antibiotic agents
including antipseudomonal penicillins and cephalosporins, car-
bapenems, fluoroquinolones and ciprofloxacin (2-4). Despite
recent improvements in therapy, P. aeruginosa bacteremia re-
mains fatal in more than 20% of cases (5). In a recent large mul-
ticenter study of all age groups, P. aeruginosa bloodstream in-
fection (BSI) was associated with crude mortality rates of 39%
in all patients and 48% in intensive care unit patients (6).
  The outcome of P. aeruginosa bacteremia has been shown to
be related to microbial (7, 8) and host factors (9-11) and treat-
ment (10-12). Understanding these factors may provide an im-
provement in treatment outcome.
  Despite an abundance of studies on the risk factors for multi-
drug resistance (MDR) and mortality of P. aeruginosa bactere-
mia, relatively few studies on P. aeruginosa bacteremia in chil-
dren have been reported in recent years (13-16). We conducted
an analysis of 62 pediatric patients with P. aeruginosa bactere-
mia at a tertiary care children’s hospital during a recent ten-year
period. We investigated the risk factors for acquisition of MDR
P. aeruginosa and the mortality rate associated with P. aerugi-
nosa bacteremia as well as its clinical characteristics and antibi-
otic susceptibility.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a retrospective analysis conducted at the Seoul Nation-
al University Children’s Hospital (SNUCH), a 300-bed tertiary
care university hospital and pediatric referral center located in
Seoul, Korea.
Study population
From January 2000 through December 2009, we studied pediat-
ric patients younger than 18 yr of age who had at least one posi-
tive blood culture for P. aeruginosa during hospitalization. The

collected data included age, gender, type of acquisition, under-
lying disease, previous antimicrobial therapy, neutropenia, use
of immunosuppressive treatment, prior surgery, use of vascular
or urinary catheters, invasive procedures during the prior 72 hr,
use of a mechanical ventilator within the previous month, pres-
ence of initial septic shock, respiratory difficulty, renal insuffi-
ciency, hepatic dysfunction, antibiotic susceptibility, MDR, and
treatment outcome.
Definitions
The presence of P. aeruginosa bacteremia was defined as the
isolation of P. aeruginosa in a blood culture (12). Only the firstP.
aeruginosa isolate, during a single clinical event, was included
in the analysis. However, it was considered as a non-related, in-
dependentepisode,ifmorethanoneepisodewasoccurredwith
more than a two-week interval in a same patient who had been
properly treated and clinically cured (17).
  Septic shock was defined as sepsis and hypotension (18) (sys-
tolic blood pressure [BP] < 70 mmHg in infant; < 70 + [2 × age in
year]afteroneyearofage)orneedforavasopressortomaintain
blood pressure (12). The primary focus of infection was defined
as a culture-positive site and/or a clinically evident site of infec-
tion concomitant with bacteremia (19). Diagnosis of catheter-
related bacteremia was defined as P. aeruginosa bacteremia in
a patient who had an intravascular device and more than one
positive blood culture result from the peripheral vein, clinical
manifestations of infection (e.g., fever, chills, and/or hypoten-
sion), and no apparent source for BSI (with the exception of the
catheter). One of the following should be present: a positive re-
sult of semiquantitative (> 15 colony-forming unit per catheter
segment) or differential time to positivity (growth in a culture of
blood obtained through a catheter hub detected via an auto-
mated blood culture system at least 2 hr earlier than a culture of
simultaneously drawn peripheral blood of equal volume) (20).
Prior steroid use was defined as at least 2 mg/kg/day or ≥ 20 mg
of prednisone daily for at least ten of the 30 days before the di-
agnosis of bacteremia. Patients who had malignant disease, pre-
mature babies, and patients receiving steroid therapy were clas-
sified as immunocompromised (19).
  The empirical antimicrobial therapy was considered appro-
priate if the causative organism was susceptible to at least one
oftheprescribedantimicrobialsaccordingtoaninvitrotestwith-
in 24 hr after blood culture sampling (12, 19).
Microbiology and antibiotic susceptibility
P. aeruginosa isolates obtained from the blood of patients at the
SNUCH during the study period from January 2000 through
December2009werecollectedandstoredat-70°C.Speciesiden-
tification was carried out using VITEK-GNI cards (BioMerieux,
Hazelwood, MO, USA) from 2000 to 2006 and was performed
using the VITEK II system (BioMerieux) or Microscan system
(MicroScan®
WalkAway 96 plus system, Siemens Healthcare
Diagnostics Inc., West Sacramento, CA, USA) after 2006.
  Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the disk
diffusion method recommended by the CLSI guidelines (21) or
the automatically calculated minimal inhibitory concentration
(MIC) method of VITEK or a Microscan system. The tested an-
tibiotics included amikacin, aztreonam, cefepime, ceftazidime,
ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, piperacillin, piperacillin/
tazobactam, and tobramycin. Intermediate susceptibility to an
antibiotic was considered as resistance, in correspondence with
clinical practice. MDR was defined as a lack of susceptibility to
three or more of the following antibiotics: 1) ciprofloxacin; 2)
imipenem; 3) gentamicin, tobramycin, or amikacin; 4) ceftazi-
dime or cefepime; and 5) piperacillin or piperacillin-tazobac-
tam (22).
Statistical analysis
Potential risk factors for MDR P. aeruginosa bacteremia and
mortality were identified using univariate analysis, and Fisher’s
exact test was used for categorical variables. Variables for which
the P value was < 0.05 in univariate analysis were included in a
logistic regression model for multivariable analysis using a back-
ward-Wald selection process. A P value < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. A statistical package (SPSS, version 17.0,
SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all analyses.
 
Ethics statement
This study was approved by the institutional review board of the
Seoul National University Hospital (IRB registration number H-
1007-151-324). Informed consent was exempted by the board.
RESULTS
Epidemiology and demographic characteristics
During the period from January 2000 to December 2009, a total
of 75 patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia were identified at
the SNUCH. On average, 7.5 episodes of P. aeruginosa bactere-
mia occurredinoneyearwitharangeof1-15casesperyear.The
meanincidencerate(±standarddeviation;SD)was0.09(±0.05)
episodes/1,000 patient-admission days per year. Among the 75
casesofP.aeruginosabacteremia,medicalrecordswereunavail-
able for 13 (17.3%) patients, which were excluded from clinical
analysis and as a result, a total of 62 episodes was analyzed in
this study.
  The mean (± SD) age of the patients was 6.5 (± 5.5) yr old
(range;0-17yrold),and40(64.5%)patientsweremale(Table1).
P. aeruginosa bacteremia occurred in a mean of 29.5 hospital-
days.
  Fifty-nine (95.2%) of 62 patients had underlying disease. The
most common underlying diseases were hematological and on-
cological disease; 58.1% (36/62) of the patients had neutrope-

nia with an absolute neutrophil count < 500 cells/μL at the on-
set of bacteremia. Three patients (4.8%) had no underlying dis-
ease, andallofthesepatientswereyoungerthanoneyearofage.
Theinitialdiagnosesinthesethreewerepneumoniawithpleural
effusion, severe skin infection, and bacteremia without focus.
  At the onset of bacteremia, 40 patients (64.5%) had infection
foci. The most common infection site was the lung (22.6%; 14/
62), followed by skin and soft tissue (16.1%; 10/62) and central
catheter-related infection (11.3%; 7/62). Primary sites of infec-
tion could not be elucidated in 35.5% (22/62) cases.
Antimicrobial susceptibility
Of the 62 P. aeruginosa isolates, the resistance rates for the anti-
biotics were as follows; 24.2% for aztreonam, 16.1% for imipen-
em, 14.5% for gentamicin, 12.9% for piperacillin and piperacil-
lin/tazobactam,and11.3%forcefepimeandceftazidime,respec-
tively.
  Sevenisolates(11.3%)showedMDRphenotypes,fiveofwhich
were identified in 2003; remaining two isolates were identified
in each year of 2005 and 2008, separately. For the MDR pheno-
types, there was no overlapping patient. P. aeruginosa isolates
with cefepime, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam resis-
tance showed MDR phenotypes substantially. Pan-drug resis-
tance for P. aeruginosa was not yet identified in this study. Only
one (1.6%) isolate was resistant against amikacin. All of the iso-
lates tested were susceptible to ciprofloxacin.
Risk factors for MDR P. aeruginosa bacteremia
The variables considered as possible risk factors for acquisition
of MDR-P. aeruginosa are shown in Table 2. In the univariate
analysis, MDR-P. aeruginosa cases were more frequently asso-
ciated with previous extended-spectrum cephalosporin use
within one month (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.2-31.1), an intensive care
unit (ICU) stay (OR, 6.8; 95% CI, 1.3-35.8), and a long hospital
stay (> 30 days) (OR, 5.3; 95% CI, 1.0-27.4).
  An ICU stay within the previous one month was the only sta-
tistically-significant risk factor for MDR acquisition in the mul-
tivariate analysis, adjusted for age and gender in addition to the
variables with P < 0.05 in the univariate analysis (adjusted OR,
6.8; 95% CI, 1.3-35.8, P = 0.023)
Clinical outcomes of P. aeruginosa bacteremia
The overall case fatality associated with P. aeruginosa bactere-
mia was 14.5% (9 of 62). The fatality rate of the MDR-P. aerugi-
nosa group was 57.1% (4/7) compared with 9.1% (5/55) in the
non-MDR group (OR, 13.3; 95% CI, 2.3-77.2, P = 0.006).
  A higher fatality rate was observed in the cases with the fol-
lowing factors by the univariate analysis; pulmonary infection,
presentation with septic shock, respiratory difficulty, renal in-
sufficiency, andantibiogramofMDRphenotype(Table3).Pres-

DISCUSSION
The objective of the present retrospective study was to evaluate
the clinical patterns, antibiotic sensitivity, independent risk fac-
tors for MDR and treatment outcomes of P. aeruginosa bactere-
mia in children. We found that fifty-nine (95.2%) of 62 patients
had underlying disease, seven isolates (11.3%) showed MDR
phenotypes,andoverallcasefatalitywas14.5%(9of62).Wealso
foundthatICUstaywithinthepreviousonemonthwasindepen-
dently associated with the development of MDR P. aeruginosa
bacteremia, and presentation with respiratory difficulty was an
independent risk factor for all-cause fatality due to P. aerugino-
sa bacteremia. Previous investigations have already described
riskfactorsofanMDRphenotypeinP. aeruginosainfection.Cao
et al. (4) demonstrated that the use of imipenem or meropen-
em and mechanical ventilation were independent risk factors
for MDR P. aeruginosa infections. Johnson et al. (22) document-
ed thatprevioustransplantation,hospital-acquiredBSI and ICU
admission in the year before MDR P. aeruginosa BSI were inde-
pendent risk factors. Gulay et al. (23) showed that the major risk
factorsforinfectionorcolonizationwithMDRP.aeruginosawere
prolonged stay in the ICU, previous and lengthy imipenem us-
age, and mechanical ventilation. To our knowledge, our study
provides the first data revealing the risk factors of an MDR P. ae-
ruginosa infections among pediatric groups based on the 10 yr
observation, in which previous ICU stay was found to be a risk
factor of MDR P. aeruginosa infection. It may be hypothesized
that colonization of P. aeruginosa in the ICU can cause infection
and may be a risk factor for MDR P. aeruginosa infection.
  Recently, resistance to antimicrobial agents of P. aeruginosa
has become a more serious clinical problem (3, 24, 25). More-
over, prevalence of MDR phenotype is increasing among P. ae-
ruginosa in adult patients (26, 27). However, we were unable to
demonstrate an increased imipenem-resistance or MDR phe-
notypes of P. aeruginosa bacteremia during the study period.
This phenomenon might be associated with the small number
of cases in this study. Furthermore, all isolates were susceptible
to ciprofloxacin, which differs from results from another study

(28). Recently the resistance rate for quinolone among E. coli
and K. pneumoniae blood isolates obtained from children in
our institute was increasing accompanying with an increment
of quinolone usuage (unpublished data). As a result, continu-
ous monitoring should be manditory for increasing trends of
MDR phenotypes or quinolone resistance among P. aeruginosa
isolates in pediatric hospitals.
  Infections caused by MDR P. aeruginosa are difficult to treat
(4). Our results show the case fatality for MDR group to be as
high as 50% and higher than that in the non-MDR group, even
though some studies have suggested that MDR phenotype is
not a predictor for fatality with P. aeruginosa (4, 22). This fatality
rate was consistent with the result of an earlier study which re-
portedthattheoddsofdeathinpatientswithMDRP.aeruginosa
bacteremia was 3.9 (95% CI, 1.42-10.78, P = 0.002) times higher
than that for patients with non-MDR P. aeruginosa (16).
  The fatality rate associated with P. aeruginosa bacteremia is
higherthanthoseofallotherbacteremiainthehospitalsettings.
Thus, appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy is of particular
importance in these cases. There are several studies emphasiz-
ing theimportanceofappropriateinitialantimicrobialtreatment
(11, 12, 29). Kang et al. (12) emphasized that delayed effective
antimicrobialtherapyforP.aeruginosabacteremia,presentation
with septic shock, pneumonia and increasing APACHE II score
tended to be related to higher mortality. However, in another
study, inactive empiric antibiotic therapy was not an indepen-
dent predictor of mortality with MDR P. aeruginosa infection,
but the authors postulated a small number of patients who re-
ceivedinappropriateempirictherapy(4.6%;23/503)asthecause
(22). In the current study, the initial appropriateness of antibiot-
ics was not a predictor of fatality like a previous study (22). This
result was probably due to the small number (14.5%) of the pa-
tients who had initially received inappropriate empirical thera-
py and who then later received the appropriate antibiotics.
  In a pediatric study, Grisaru-Soen et al. (14) demonstrated
that underlying disease was the only factor correlated with mor-
tality according to multiple regression analysis. In our study,
most of the P. aeruginosa bacteremia cases occurred to the pa-
tients with underlying disease, but underlying disease was not
an independent risk factor (data was not shown). In our study,
the presence of respiratory difficulty was the only independent
risk factor related to overall fatality.
  This study has several limitations. First, it was retrospective
and performed at a single health-care center. Therefore, the re-
sults are not representative of all pediatric patients in Korea.
Second, we did not conduct an analysis of the genotypes of the
P.aeruginosaisolatesanddidnotelucidateclusteredoccurrence
of MDR phenotypes in 2003. Third, for the outcome analysis,
the formal severity of the illness scores could not be calculated
due to the retrospective nature of this study and to the absence
of certain data in the medical records.
  However, this study has some advantages. Our hospital is a
referral institution and a university-affiliated tertiary hospital
with relatively many pediatric patients diagnosed with P. aeru-
ginosa bacteremia. In addition, this study included for invasive
P. aeruginosa isolates obtained over a consecutive 10 yr.
  Inconclusion,ourstudyrevealedthatapreviousICUstaywas
associated with acquisition of MDR P. aeruginosa and presen-
tation with respiratory difficulty was independent predictors of
fatal outcomes among pediatric patients with P. aeruginosa bac-
teremia. P. aeruginosa bacteremia has become a major concern
not only for adults but also for children with underlying disease
who are at high risk for health care-associated infection. Con-
tinuous monitoring is required for early detection of increment
of MDR or PDR-phenotypes among P. aeruginosa isolates and
for timely management of patients with probably higher fatality
rate. Additionally, future efforts should be concentrated on the
prevention and treatment of P. aeruginosa bacteremia in high-
risk children.

AUTHOR SUMMARY
Pseudomonas aeruginosa Bacteremia in Children Over Ten Consecutive Years:
Analysis of Clinical Characteristics, Risk Factors of Multi-drug Resistance and
Clinical Outcomes
Mi Ae Yang, Jina Lee, Eun Hwa Choi, and Hoan Jong Lee
This study aimed to evaluate the clinical profiles, antibiotic susceptibility, risk factors of multi-drug resistance (MDR) and outcomes
of P. aeruginosa bacteremia in children. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of pediatric patients with P. aeruginosa
bacteremia at a tertiary children’s hospital in Seoul, Korea from January 2000 to December 2009. A total of 62 episodes were
evaluated. An intensive care unit (ICU) stay within the previous one month was the only independent risk factor for MDR P.
aeruginosa bacteremia. The overall fatality rate associated with P. aeruginosa bacteremia was 14.5%. The fatality rate in patients
with MDR P. aeruginosa was 57.1%, compared with 9.1% in non-MDR patients. However, the presence of respiratory difficulty
was the only independent risk factor for overall fatality associated with P. aeruginosa bacteremia. A previous ICU stay and
presentation with respiratory difficulty were associated with acquisition of MDR P. aeruginosa and a higher fatality rate, respectively.
