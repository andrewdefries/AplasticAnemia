INTRODUCTION
Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver is a severe com-
plication of intensive chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation (HSCT). The incidence rate of VOD ranges
from 5% to 60%, and the mortality rate is as high as 50%
in some studies (1-4). In children who have undergone HSCT,
the incidence of VOD ranges from 22% to 28%, and the mor-
tality rate is reported to be up to 47% (5-8). VOD is charac-
terized by right upper quadrant pain, hepatomegaly, fluid
retention, ascites, weight gain and hyperbilirubinemia occur-
ring by day 20 after HSCT (1).
Reported risk factors for developing VOD include pre-
HSCT liver dysfunction, poor performance status, female gen-
der, advanced disease status at the time of transplantation,
prior hepatic irradiation, vancomycin or amphotericin B use
in the early post transplantation period, HLA mismatch-relat-
ed or -unrelated donor transplantation, and use of busulfan
(Bu) or total body irradiation (TBI) as a conditioning regimen
(2, 5-11). An important new risk factor for VOD is adminis-
tration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg), an anti-CD33
monoclonal antibody (12-17).
The prevention of fatal VOD is an obvious priority. The
prophylactic use of drugs such as heparin or prostaglandin E1
(PGE1) has a beneficial effect in preventing VOD development.
Some reports show that continuous infusion of low dose hep-
arin is highly effective in preventing VOD after HSCT with-
out an added risk of bleeding (18, 19). PGE1 is a vasodilator
with inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation and prothrom-
bolytic activity (20). Gluckman et al. reported that the use of
prophylactic PGE1 via continuous intravenous infusion dec-
reased the overall incidence of VOD, although they did not
use lipo-PGE1 (21). Cho et al. reported the possible beneficial
effect of lipo-PGE1 to prevent development of VOD, whereas
they did not compare the efficacy with control group (22).
The purpose of the present single center study was to iden-
tify VOD risk factors and the effect of prophylactic low-dose
heparin or PGE1 on pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic
HSCT.

Prophylactic Low-dose Heparin or Prostaglandin E1 may Prevent
Severe Veno-occlusive Disease of the Liver after Allogeneic
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Korean Children
Studies investigating the effect of prophylactic drugs on hepatic veno-occlusive dis-
ease (VOD) development are rare in children that have undergone allogeneic he-
matopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This study examined risk factors for
VOD, the effect of prophylactic low-dose heparin or lipo-prostaglandin E1 (lipo-PGE1)
and the survival rate at day +100 in children undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Eighty
five children underwent HSCT between June 1997 and September 2004. Patients
were diagnosed and classified as having mild, moderate or severe VOD according
to Seattle clinical criteria. Among 85 patients, 25 (29%) developed VOD. VOD occurr-
ed more frequently in patients receiving busulfan-based conditioning (24/65, 37%)
than in those receiving TBI-based (1/10, 10%) or other (0/10, 0%) regimens (p<0.05).
The incidence of VOD was lower in patients with non-malignant disease compared
to those with malignant disease (p<0.05). Survival at day +100 for non-VOD patients
was better than that for VOD patients (92% vs. 76%, p<0.05). No patients receiving
prophylactic heparin or lipo-PGE1 were found to develop severe VOD, whereas 5
of 35 patients not receiving such prophylaxis developed severe VOD. Given severe
VOD is associated with a high mortality rate, this study indicates that prophylactic
heparin or lipo-PGE1 may decrease mortality in children undergoing HSCT.

at the Asan Medical Center between June 1997 and Septem-
ber 2004 were enrolled. Four patients who died of causes other
than VOD before day +21 were subsequently excluded. The
medical records of the remaining 85 patients were retrospec-
tively reviewed.
Risk factors for development of VOD
The following parameters were evaluated to determine their
status as risk factors for the development of VOD: 1) patient-
related factors: age at time of HSCT, disease status at the time
of transplantation, viral serology results in both donor and
recipient, and liver function before HSCT; 2) transplantation-
related factors: stem cell source, HLA matching, condition-
ing regimen and prophylactic treatment for VOD.
Risk factors for the severity of VOD
The following factors were evaluated to determine their
effect on the severity of VOD: maximum level of total serum
bilirubin, maximum level of serum aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase
(ALP), maximum level of serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN),
serum creatinine (Cr) and post-transplantation weight gain.
Classification of disease status
Diseases were divided into three groups according to type
and status at the time of transplantation: 1) non-malignant
diseases, including severe aplastic anemia (SAA), pure red cell
anemia (PRCA), chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and
hemophagocytic lymphoproliferate histiocytosis (HLH) in
second remission, 2) early stage hematologic malignancies,
including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the first
or second complete remission, acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
in the first complete remission, myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase,
acute mixed lineage leukemia (AMLL) in the first complete
remission and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML),
3) advanced stage hematologic malignancies, including ALL
in greater than the second complete remission, CML in the
accelerated phase, AMLL beyond the first complete remission
and acute leukemia in partial remission.
VOD definition and severity
Definition: Seattle clinical criteria were used for VOD diag-
nosis. A diagnosis of VOD required two of the following
within 20 days of transplantation; serum bilirubin >2 mg/
dL (34 M/L), hepatomegaly and weight gain >2% over
baseline.
Severity: The severity of VOD was classified as mild, mod-
erate or severe. Mild VOD was defined as the absence of adverse
effects of liver dysfunction with complete resolution of symp-
toms and signs. Moderate VOD was characterized as the ad-
verse effects of liver dysfunction requiring therapy such as
diuretics for fluid retention and analgesics for pain. Severe
VOD was defined as the persistence of symptoms after day
100 or death before day 100 with ongoing VOD.
Prophylactic treatment for VOD
Prophylactic heparin (Heparin sodium, Hanlim, Seoul,
Korea) was administered using the dose 100 U/kg/day in con-
tinuous intravenous infusion, starting on day -7 until day
+30. Heparin was discontinued if testing found the activated
partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) had increased by 1.2-fold
over normal, or if there were any major bleeding episodes.
Lipo-PGE1 (Eglandin; alprostadil, Welfide, Osaka, Japan) was
continuously intravenously infused at a dose of 1 g/kg/day
from day +1 until day +30. Patients were assigned to receive
or not receive prophylaxis according to the decision of each
physician.
Statistical methods
Associations between VOD, potential risk factors and pro-
phylaxis were tested by univariate analyses using the chi-square
test or Fisher’s exact test for comparing categorical variables,
and t tests for comparing continuous variables. Variables asso-
ciated with a p<0.1 in univariate analysis were fitted to a logis-
tic regression model for multivariate analysis. Analysis of sur-
vival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-
rank test. All data were analyzed using SPSS version 11.5.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Patient characteristics at the time of transplantation are
shown in Table 1. The median age at HSCT was 7.3 yr (range:
0.6 to 15.6 yr). Of a total of 85 patients, 11 received trans-
plantation for non-malignant disease and 74 for malignant
disease. Of the 74 patients with malignant disease, 11 were
transplanted in the advanced stage of the disease. Condition-
ing regimens were Bu-based for 65 patients (oral Bu for 33,
intravenous Bu for 32), TBI-based for 10, and other regimens
in 10 patients that included a case of non-myeloablative con-
ditioning.
Incidence of VOD
VOD developed in 25 of 85 patients (29%) with the medi-
an diagnosis day being 11.4 (range: day -4 to day +21). Of
25 patients, 12 had mild VOD (48%), 8 had moderate VOD
(32%) and 5 had severe VOD (20%).
Risk factors for the development of VOD
Univariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors
for VOD (Table 2). Age at transplantation, stem cell source
and HLA matching were found not to be risk factors. Simi-
larly, viral status including CMV, HSV, HBV and HCV for
either donor or recipient at transplantation had no significant
influence on development of VOD. In contrast, disease sta-
tus was identified as a risk factor, with none of 13 non-malig-
nant disease patients developing VOD, while 20 of 61 patients
with early stage hematologic malignancy (36%) and 5 of 11
patients with advanced stage hematologic malignancy (45%)
developing VOD (p<0.03). The type of conditioning regimen
was also found to affect VOD development (p=0.02), with

Bu-based regimens associated with an incidence of 37%, TBI-
based regimens associated with an incidence of 10%, and
other conditioning regimens associated with an incidence of
0%. There was no difference in VOD incidence according
to the formulation of Bu (41% for oral Bu vs. 34% for intra-
venous Bu, p=0.80). Prophylactic treatment with either low-
dose heparin (2/10, 20%) or lipo-PGE1 (14/40, 35%) showed
no difference on development of VOD (p=0.53).
Pre-transplantation liver function
Pre-transplantation liver function and albumin levels were
similar for both VOD and non-VOD patients (Table 3). The
incidence of VOD in patients with normal liver function (AST
<40 IU/L, ALT <40 IU/L, total bilirubin <1.2 mg/dL and
albumin >3 g/dL) was 27% (18/68) and that in patients with
abnormal liver function was 42% (7/17). However there was
no significant difference in the incidence of VOD between
two groups (p=0.37).
Severity of VOD
The median for development of mild/moderate VOD was
day +12 (range: -4 to +21), while the median for severe VOD
was day +7 (range: +2 to +15) (p>0.05). There were no sig-
nificant differences in maximum levels of AST, ALT, total
bilirubin and ALP after transplantation between patients with
mild/moderate VOD and those with severe VOD. While the
raw data suggested higher total bilirubin levels in severe VOD
compared to mild/moderate VOD patients, statistical analysis
did not find this difference significant. Ascites developed in
8 of 20 (40%) mild/moderate VOD patients and 4 of 5 (80%)
severe VOD patients (p>0.05). There was no significant differ-
ence between the two groups in terms of maximum serum
BUN or Cr after transplantation. While renal dysfunction that
elevated serum Cr more than twice the baseline level or re-
quired dialysis was more frequent in patients with severe
VOD, the difference from mild/moderate VOD patients was
not statistically significant. However, renal dysfunction was
less frequent in patients with mild VOD compared to patients
with moderate or severe VOD (p=0.03). The occurrence of
pulmonary dysfunction was more common in severe VOD
compared to mild/moderate VOD patients (Table 4).

Prophylaxis and VOD severity
Of the 85 patients, 50 received prophylactic low-dose hep-
arin or lipo-PGE1 treatment for VOD and 35 did not. Al-
though the overall incidence of VOD did not differ between
treated and non-treated patients (16/50 vs. 9/35, respective-
ly), fewer patients receiving prophylaxis developed severe VOD
compared to patients who did not receive prophylaxis (0/50
vs. 5/35, respectively, p=0.02) (Table 5). None of patients who
received either lipo-PGE1 or heparin developed severe VOD.
Survival
All 5 patients with severe VOD died of causes directly att-
ributable to VOD, leading to an estimated survival rate of 0%
at 100 days posttransplant. In contrast, the survival rate for
patients with mild/moderate VOD was 95%, and for patients
without VOD the rate was 92% (p<0.01) (Fig. 1).
DISCUSSION
Hepatic VOD is one of the most common life-threatening
complications that can occur during HSCT. The incidence
of VOD is reported to range from 5% to 60% in adults (1-
4, 21, 23), and the incidence of post-transplantation VOD
in children is reported to range from 18% to 28%, with the
ranges probably reflecting the differences in conditioning
regimens, type of graft and patient characteristics (5-8, 24,
25). Comparable to those results, the present retrospective
study found that the incidence of hepatic VOD in pediatric
patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT was 29%.
Pre-HSCT risk factors for VOD development include old
age, elevated transaminases prior to conditioning therapy,
previous abdominal radiation and advanced disease (2, 9).
Our study found that age at HSCT and pre-transplantation
liver function were not risk factors, whereas presence of hema-
tologic malignancy was a risk factor. Reported HSCT-relat-
ed risk factors for VOD development include conditioning
regimen, degree of HLA matching, donor type and positive
CMV serology in the recipient (2, 9, 24, 25). In particular,
others report a higher incidence of VOD in patients receiving
Bu and cyclophosphamide (Cy) compared with those receiv-
ing TBI and Cy (26). Similarly, in this study the incidence of
VOD in patients using Bu and Cy was 30%, and the inci-
dence of VOD in patients using TBI and Cy was 10%. These
data indicate that Bu and Cy conditioning was a risk factor
for VOD development, although there was no difference in
VOD incidence according to the formulation of Bu. There-
fore, the higher incidence of VOD in malignancy compared
to non-malignant disease might be associated with condition-
ing regimens including Bu or TBI that were not used in non-
malignant disease. Unlike Carreras et al. (2), the present study
found that the degree of HLA matching was not a risk factor.
We also found that the incidence of VOD was not affected
by stem cell source or viral serology status (CMV, HSV, HBV,
HCV) of either the donor or recipient at transplantation. Pre-
vious studies have reported that maximum total bilirubin,
maximum BUN, maximum Cr and maximum AST levels
were higher in severe VOD compared to mild/moderate VOD
patients (23, 25).
A previous retrospective study of pediatric patients found
that severe VOD was diagnosed earlier than mild/moderate
VOD, and that the former was associated with a high inci-
dence of ascites, pulmonary dysfunction and renal dysfunc-
tion (25). A study of adults reported that ascites, pleural effu-
sion and renal dysfunction were common in severe VOD (23).
In our study, maximum levels of total bilirubin and AST did
not differ between mild/moderate and severe VOD patients.
However, it may be difficult to draw firm conclusions from
these observations as this study included only a relatively small
number of severe VOD patients. Possibly reflecting this, al-
though the raw data showed ascites (80%) and renal dysfunc-
tion (80%) were observed more frequently in severe VOD
patients compared to mild/moderate VOD patients, this dif-
ference did not reach statistical significance. We found that
pulmonary dysfunction requiring O2 supply or intubation
occurred more frequently in severe VOD than in mild/mod-
erate VOD patients, as reported elsewhere (23).
Recently, several centers conducted studies examining the
use of defibrotide (DF) to treat VOD. A multicenter study
found the complete response rate in severe VOD patients was
50% for pediatric patients (27) and 36% in children and adults
(28).
While DF is a partially successful therapeutic treatment
for severe VOD, administration of prophylactic treatments
is generally considered a superior strategy. However, currently
there are no effective prophylactic treatments for VOD. Pro-
phylactic strategies have included administration of low-dose
heparin or PGE1. One randomized study has demonstrated
that low-dose heparin reduced the overall incidence of VOD
(18). There has been a few trials reporting that PGE1 or lipo-
PGE1 is an effective prophylacxis for VOD (21, 22). The lim-
ited number of studies in this area indicates there is a criti-
cal lack of data regarding these putative prophylactic appro-
aches for VOD.
We found that neither prophylactic low-dose heparin nor
lipo-PGE1 reduced the incidence of VOD. However, these
prophylactic strategies reduced the severity of VOD, with
no patients treated with low-dose heparin or lipo-PGE1 found
to develop severe VOD. However development of severe VOD
was not different between patients receiving low-dose hep-
arin and those receiving lipo-PGE1. This observation may
have particular clinical significance given that no severe VOD
patients survived more than 100 days in the present study,
whereas the non-severe VOD survival rate was greater than
90%. In regard to mortality rates reported by others, Barker
et al. (24) found that the post-transplantation mortality rate
at day 100 was 38.5%, and that severe VOD was associated
with a mortality rate of 98% by day 100 after HSCT.
The present study made a number of significant findings.
First, pediatric patients with non-malignant disease developed
VOD less frequently than those with malignant disease, and
the stage of hematologic malignancy did not affect the inci-
dence of VOD. Second, pediatric patients who received Bu-
based conditioning regimens developed VOD more frequently
than those receiving TBI-based or other regimens. Finally,
VOD was less severe in pediatric patients administered pro-
phylactic lipo-PGE1 or low-dose heparin. These data indicate
that administration of prophylactic low-dose heparin or lipo-
PGE1 may improve outcomes after HSCT in children. The
present findings highlight the need for a randomized prospec-
tive study using a larger cohort.
