Abstract: Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT) is a rare inherited autosomal recessive disorder that presents with
thrombocytopenia and absence of megakaryocytes. It presents with bleeding recognized on day 1 of life or at least within the first month.
The cause for this disorder appears to be a mutation in the gene for the thrombopoeitin (TPO) receptor, c-Mpl, despite high ­levels
of serum TPO. Patients with severe Type I-CAMT carry nonsense Mpl mutations which causes a complete loss of the TPO receptor
whereas those with Type II CAMT carry missense mutations in the Mpl gene affecting the extracellular domain of the TPO receptor.
Differential diagnosis for severe CAMT includes thrombocytopenia with absent radii (TAR) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS).
The primary treatment for CAMT is bone marrow transplantation. Bone Marrow/Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) is the only thing that
ultimately cures this genetic disease. Newer modalities are on the way, such as TPO-mimetics for binding towards partially functioning
c-Mpl receptors and gene therapy. Prognosis of CAMT patients is poor, because all develop in childhood a tri-linear marrow aplasia
that is always fatal when untreated. Thirty percent of patients with CAMT die due to bleeding complications and 20% -due to HSCT if
it has been done.

Background
Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia
(CAMT) is a rare autosomal recessive bone mar-
row failure syndrome that presents with severe
­thrombocytopenia which can evolve into aplastic
anemia and leukemia.1–3
The disorder is expressed
in infancy with or without physical anomalies.4,5
It is
often recognized on day 1 of life or at least within
the first month. It is often initially confused with fetal
and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, but the
neonate fails to improve and responds only to plate-
let transfusion. Eventually, a diagnostic bone marrow
is performed which can be technically difficult in a
neonate.
A recent classification was proposed in 2005
­supported by several other reports based on the course
on outcome of the disease as follows;1,5
a.	 Type I—early onset of severe pancytopenia,
decreased bone marrow activity and very low
platelet counts. In this group, there is complete
loss of functional c-Mpl. Median platelet count is
usually 21 × 109
/L or below.5
b.	 Type II—milder form with transient increases
of platelet counts up to nearly normal values
­during the first year of life and an onset of bone
­marrow failure at age 3 to 6 years or later. In this
group, there are partially functional receptors for
the c-Mpl gene. Median platelet count is usually
35 × 109
/L to 132 × 109
/L.
c.	 Type III—there is ineffective megakaryopoeisis
with no defects in the c-Mpl gene.
Presentation
The primary manifestations are ­thrombocytopenia
and megakaryocytopenia or low numbers of ­platelets
and megakaryocytes. There is an absence of mega-
karyocytes in the bone marrow with no associated
­physical abnormalities.6
Platelet size is usually
normal.7
­Bleeding is of primary concern: cutane-
ous, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and intracranial
hemorrhage.5,7
However, the presence of a ­normal
number of ­megakaryocytes on an initial bone
­marrow aspirate should not exclude CAMT from the
­differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia within
the first year of life.3
Platelet counts among neonates are usually in
the level of 150  ×  109
/L. In patients with neonatal
­thrombocytopenia, infants may show a pattern of
low/low-normal platelet counts (100–200  ×  109
/L),
with levels falling to as much as 50–100  ×  109
/L
at 4–5  days and returns to normal at 7–10  days.
Late-onset ­neonatal thrombocytopenia presents
­usually after the first 3 days of life wherein platelet
counts often drops rapidly to levels of 50 × 109
/L or
even more.8
The reasons why we have to suspect hereditary
thrombocytopenia which includes;7,9
1.	 Familial history of thrombocytopenia, especially
parent-child or maternal uncle-nephew.
2.	 Lack of platelet response to autoimmune thrombo-
cytopenia therapies.
3.	 Diagnostic features on smear such as abnormal
size platelets, absence of platelet alpha granules,
Dohle-like bodies or microcytosis.
4.	 Bleeding out of proportion to the platelet count.
5.	 Onset at birth.
6.	 Associated features such as absent radii, mental
retardation, renal failure, high tone hearing loss,
cataracts or the development of leukemia.
7.	 Persistence of a stable level of ­thrombocytopenia
for years. Some patients may present with pete-
chial purpura, cranial hematoma or recurrent
rectorrhagia.
Pathophysiology
The majority of patients have a mutation in the
gene for the thrombopoeitin (TPO) receptor, c-Mpl,
resulting in high levels of serum TPO.1,10
TPO
binding stimulates both early and late phases of
megakaryocytopoiesis, increasing the number, size,
and ploidy of ­megakaryocytes, and promoting the
expression of platelet-specific markers. TPO also
maintains the numbers of hematopoietic stem cells
thus, any abnormalities contribute to the occurrence
of both thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia in CAMT
patients. In addition, there may be ­abnormalities with
the central nervous system including the ­cerebrum
and ­cerebellum which could cause symptoms.10
­Animals deficient for TPO or c-Mpl have a 90%
reduction of megakaryocytic precursor cells and a
60%–80% decrease of both erythroid and myeloid
progenitors.11
TPO, also known as c-Mpl ligand is a cytokine
that plays a central role in megakaryopeoiesis by
Review of inherited thrombocytopenia
Clinical Medicine Insights: Pathology 2010:3	 27
­influencing the development and maturation of mega-
karyocytes and platelet production from ­hematopoetic
stem cells. TPO exerts its biological effects through
the TPO receptor, c-Mpl. C-Mpl is a member of the
cytokine receptor superfamily and its function is
restricted to hematopoietic tissues and cells, such as
bone marrow, spleen, fetal liver and CD34+ cells.
Stimulation of c-mpl with TPO results in the acti-
vation of tyrosine kinase (Tyk2) and Janus kinase
(JAK2) family members, which in turn phosphorylate
Stat5 and Stat3, causing their nuclear translocation
and the ­transcription of Stat responsive genes.12–18
Bone marrow failure in CAMT is congenital.
The pathophysiology of bone marrow failure in
CAMT is not completely understood. It has been
hypothesized that TPO and c-Mpl are necessary
for the growth and maintenance of the hematopoi-
etic stem cell population.1,19,
This has been shown
both in vitro and in vivo with murine models.
C-mpl −/− mice have demonstrated a deficiency
in megakaryocytes with severe thrombocytopenia
and high serum TPO levels similar to humans with
CAMT.20
While widely thought to be a platelet disor-
der, amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia frequently
is associated with the development of aplastic
­anemia. Of the ­congenital bone marrow ­failure syn-
dromes causing aplastic anemia, CAMT is the most
likely to present in the neonatal period. Although the
mechanisms leading to aplasia are unknown, the age
of onset has been reported to depend on the sever-
ity of the c-MPL ­functional defect. The percentage
of bone marrow cells ­expressing tumor necrosis
factor-a and ­interferon-g increases during pancy-
topenia. As in other bone marrow failure diseases,
these inhibitory cytokines contributed to the pancy-
topenia.19
A global reduction in hematopoietic pro-
genitor cells was also seen in these c-mpl ­knockout
mice. Marrow ­repopulation studies in c-mpl −/−
mice have also shown decreased engraftment com-
pared to c-mpl + mice. These ­studies indicate that
c-mpl is necessary for hematopoietic progenitor cell
development.21,22
Genetics
The myeloproliferative (Mpl) genes in patients with
CAMTwereanalyzedandreportedinsome­literatures.
The defects concern the incapacity of the TPO to
­fulfill its normal thrombopoeitic role as a result of
the abnormalities in the c-Mpl gene that encodes the
TPO receptor.23–25
Two heterozygous mutations of
the c-Mpl gene: a gln 186-to-ter substitution in exon
4 and a single nucleotide deletion in exon 10 were
found in some patients with CAMT.10
Patients with
severe Type I CAMT carries nonsense MPLmutations
which causes a complete loss of the thrombopoeitin
(TPO) receptor whereas those with Type II CAMT
carries missense mutations in the Mpl gene affect-
ing the extracellular domain of the TPO ­receptor.5
Some patients have inherited two different muta-
tions of the c- Mpl gene resulting in ­heterozygous
states.12,26,27
However, a G304C mutation has been
suggested as seen more frequently in patients with
CAMT. They described a homozygous nonsense
mutation (C268T) upstream of the mutation in
the rare G304C polymorphism.1
There is a high rate
of consanguinity between of parents of children with
CAMT, leading to the inheritance of homozygous
c-mpl mutations.28–30
A genotype to phenotype correlation has been
made with the type of mutation corresponding to
the severity of disease. Patients with frameshift or
­nonsense mutations had a rapid progression of bone
marrow failure, whereas patients with heterozygous or
homozygous missense mutations had milder ­disease.1
Perhaps, this is related to residual c-Mpl protein
function. The discovery of the c-mpl gene mutation
as the cause for CAMT has lead to the development
of diagnostic genetic testing and ­prenatal diagnosis.
The overall hematopoietic progenitor cells suggest
that in the future, gene therapy may be a possible treat-
ment option for this disorder. It is ­currently unknown
what effect c-mpl transduction would have on
c-mpl-deficient animal models. Retroviral-mediated
gene transfer of c-mpl in normal mouse bone marrow
cells has shown a reduction in megakaryopoiesis with
enhanced erythropoiesis.25
Diagnosis and Testing
Diagnostic features include:
1.	 Defective signal and response to thrombopoeitin in
megakaryocyte-colony formation—in the absence
of a signal from thrombopoeitin, megakaryocytes
do not proliferate.4
2.	 Decreased numbers of erythroid and myelocytic
progenitors in clonal cultures.4
Al-Qahtani
28	 Clinical Medicine Insights: Pathology 2010:3
3.	 Lack of Mpl mRNA in bone marrow monocellular
cells.4
4.	 Elevated serum level of TPO.1,4
5.	 White blood cells and red blood cells gradually
decrease with age.10
6.	 No reactivity to TPO by the hematopoietic
­progenitor cells.1,10
7.	 Absent surface expression of the TPO receptor
Mpl.10
8.	 Hypoplastic bone marrow without dysplasia.31
Mpl gene analysis is performed by bi-directional
sequencing of the coding regions and splice sites
of exons 1–12 of the Mpl gene. Mutations found
in the first person of a family to be tested are
confirmed by repeat analysis using sequencing,
restriction ­fragment analysis, or other appropriate
method. Using the GeneDx (GeneDx, DNA diag-
nostic experts, MD, USA) has 95%–97% sensitiv-
ity because it can detect almost all expected types
of the Mpl gene, except for some promoter muta-
tions, large deletions or duplications that are out-
side the regions sequenced that can not be detected.
Specimens usually are taken as a single sample with
1.5  ml whole blood in ­ethylenediamineteraacetic
acid (EDTA), buccal brushes as alternative samples
or 10 mL of amniotic fluid.32
Cytogenic investiga-
tions and analysis can be done also by fluorescent
in-situ hybridization (FISH) on interphase nuclei.
Chromosome analyses are performed on bone
marrow and peripheral blood- simulated cultures.
Skin fibroblasts can be cultured and quinacrine
­fluorescence (QFQ) banding can be used for chro-
mosome analysis.33
Differential Diagnoses
Differential diagnosis for severe CAMT includes
thrombocytopeniawithabsentradii(TAR)andWiskott-
Aldrich syndrome (WAS).24,34–36
These can be distin-
guished from CAMTon the basis of ­associated skeletal
hypoplasia of the arms (TAR) and ­microthrombocytes
(WAS).34,35
In addition, ­antiplatelet antibodies maybe
transferred from the mother to the child in-utero or at
the time of delivery, causing severe thrombocytope-
nia. Women who lack common platelet antigens may
produce antibodies against paternal antigens that are
expressed in the developing fetus.
Treatment
Treatment options for CAMT are limited. ­Supportive
care includes judicious use of unrelated donor
platelet transfusions (leucocyte-induced, and
­irradiated), avoidance of non-steroidal anti-inflam-
matory medications and aspirin, adjunctive therapies
such as fibrinolytic agents for minor bleeding,
and ­monitoring for the development of additional
cytopenias. ­Platelets transfusions may be efficient
in increasing the ­platelet count up to 10 days. Fre-
quent platelet transfusions are required to ensure
that platelet levels do not fall to dangerous ­levels,
although this is not always the case.5
It is known for
patients to continue to create very small numbers of
platelets over time. ­Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP)
should be avoided in small infants due to the risk
of hyponatremia but may be useful in older ­children
and adults. Cytokine ­therapy with ­interleukin-3 and
granulocyte-macrophage ­colony-stimulating fac-
tor has been attempted but only resulted in ­transient
responses.1,36
Steroids and immunoglobulins does
not have an effect on thrombocytopenia, thus is not
advised.5
The primary treatment for CAMT is bone
­marrow transplantation.5,37
Bone Marrow/Stem Cell
­Transplant is the only thing that ultimately cures this
genetic disease. Children and their family members
should be human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-typed to
identify possible matched related donors. Siblings
that are heterozygous for a c-mpl mutation may have
abnormal megakaryocytes despite normal peripheral
platelet counts,12
and usually a sibling can be used as
a donor.4
If a matched sibling is not available, trans-
plantation may still be necessary, especially when
marrow failure ensues, but reported outcomes using
matched unrelated donors have been poor and rates
of graft failure are high.5,7
Newer modalities are on
the way, such as TPO-mimetics for binding towards
partially functioning c-Mpl receptors38
and gene
therapy.39
Prognosis and Mortality
Although HSCT has been implicated to treat
­ultimately CAMT, preliminary studies showed that
the prognosis of CAMT patients becomes poor when
tri-linear marrow aplasia develops in childhood.5
Review of inherited thrombocytopenia
Clinical Medicine Insights: Pathology 2010:3	 29
Furthermore, a single study showed that 30% of
CAMT patients die to bleeding complications and
20% is actually due to HSCT if it has been done.5
Moreover, the same study showed that in patients who
underwentHSCT,conditioningregimenwithbusulfan
(BU) and cyclophosphamide plus antithymocyte
globulin and graft-versus-host prophylaxis with
cyclosporine and methotrexate improves survival up
to 80% of patients.40
