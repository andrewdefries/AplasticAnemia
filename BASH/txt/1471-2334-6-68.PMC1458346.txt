Abstract
Background: The seasonality, clinical and radiographic features and outcome of aseptic meningitis have
been described for regional outbreaks but data from a wider geographic area is necessary to delineate the
epidemiology of this condition.
Methods: A retrospective chart review was completed of children presenting with aseptic meningitis to
eight Canadian pediatric hospitals over a two-year period.
Results: There were 233 cases of proven enteroviral (EV) meningitis, 495 cases of clinical aseptic
meningitis and 74 cases of possible aseptic meningitis with most cases occurring July to October.
Headache, vomiting, meningismus and photophobia were more common in children ≥ 5 years of age, while
rash, diarrhea and cough were more common in children < 5 years of age. Pleocytosis was absent in 22.3%
of children < 30 days of age with proven EV meningitis. Enterovirus was isolated in cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) from 154 of 389 patients (39.6%) who had viral culture performed, and a nucleic acid amplification
test for enterovirus was positive in CSF from 81 of 149 patients (54.3%). Imaging of the head by
computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was completed in 96 cases (19.7%) and 24 had
abnormal findings that were possibly related to meningitis while none had changes that were definitely
related to meningitis. There was minimal morbidity and there were no deaths.
Conclusion: The clinical presentation of aseptic meningitis varies with the age of the child. Absence of
CSF pleocytosis is common in infants < 30 days of age. Enterovirus is the predominant isolate, but no
etiologic agent is identified in the majority of cases of aseptic meningitis in Canadian children.

Background
Aseptic meningitis is inflammation of the meninges with
sterile bacterial cultures of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [1].
Although the most common cause in North America is
viral meningitis, the differential diagnosis includes "par-
tially-treated" bacterial meningitis, tuberculous or fungal
meningitis, inflammation from a para-meningeal bacte-
rial infection, collagen vascular diseases, and drug-
induced meningeal inflammation. Non-polio enterovi-
ruses account for 80 to 90% of cases of viral meningitis
where a cause can be determined [2,3].
The use of nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) for enter-
ovirus has allowed for rapid diagnosis of viral meningitis,
which may decrease the use of empiric antibiotics and the
length of hospital stay (LOS) [2,4,5]. The purpose of this
study was to establish the seasonality, clinical and radio-
graphic features, management and short term-outcomes
of Canadian children presenting over a wide geographic
area with aseptic meningitis of presumed viral origin in
the modern era.
Methods
The study was conducted at eight university-affiliated
pediatric hospitals in major urban sites across Canada.
Local ethics review boards at all sites approved the study.
Health records were searched for all children ≤ 18 years of
age discharged 1 January 1998 to 31 December 1999 with
one or more of the following International Classification
of Diseases – Clinical Modification codes: 1) bacterial
meningitis 320.9 2) meningitis 322.9 3) viral meningitis
047.9 4) aseptic meningitis 047.9 or 5) EV meningitis
047.9. The inclusion criteria were 1) an abnormal CSF
white blood cell (WBC) count defined as: WBC (×106/L)
>35 for age < 30 days; >25 for age 30 to 60 days; >5 for age
≥ 61 days [5], 2) a non-bacterial organism identified in
CSF by culture, antigen detection or NAT, or 3) a clinical
diagnosis of presumed viral meningitis by the attending
physician. The exclusion criteria included 1) isolation of a
bacterial pathogen from CSF or blood culture or radiolog-
ical or histological evidence of bacterial meningitis, 2)
fungal or parasitic meningitis, 3) meningitis due to neo-
plasm, and 4) herpes simplex virus meningitis.
Data was collected on the month of presentation, age and
gender of the child, presence of underlying medical con-
ditions, body temperature and symptoms at presentation
(headache, nausea, vomiting, meningismus, photopho-
bia, rash, diarrhea, and/or cough), and the results of viro-
logic investigations from the local laboratory and
computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of the brain, when completed. The use of
acyclovir, antibiotics and corticosteroids was recorded.
For inpatients, the LOS was recorded in hours and
expressed as portion of a day if less than 24 hours and by
number of days if greater than 24 hours. Complications
such as seizures, hearing loss, subdural collections, and
intensive care unit admission were recorded.
Cases were then classified according to predefined criteria
as:
1. Proven enteroviral (EV) meningitis:
a. cases with positive EV NAT or EV culture from CSF, or
b. cases with positive EV culture from throat swabs or
stool samples and abnormal CSF WBC count
2. Meningitis with identification of viruses other than EV
in CSF
3. Clinical aseptic meningitis – cases with abnormal CSF
WBC count defined as above and either no viral investiga-
tions or negative viral investigations on CSF, throat swab
and stool samples
4. Possible aseptic meningitis – patients designated as
having aseptic meningitis by discharge diagnosis, but with
normal CSF WBC count or no lumbar puncture (LP) per-
formed
Where RBC contamination was suspected, an adjustment
was made by subtracting a factor of 1 per 1000 RBC before
the criteria of abnormal CSF WBC was applied [6]. Cere-
brospinal protein was classified as normal if it was ≤ 0.9
grams/litre (G/L) for infants < 30 days old and ≤ 0.45 G/L
for infants ≥ 30 days [7]. CSF glucose was defined as
abnormal if it was less than two-thirds of serum glucose
when both values were available [6].
Analyses were performed using with SPSS 11.5 for Win-
dows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Significant differences
among categorical variables were identified using Chi
square test or Fisher's exact test where applicable. Normal-
ity of quantitative variables was evaluated using Shapiro-
Wilk and group medians were compared with Kruskal-
Wallis test.
Results
Demographics
There were 233 cases of proven EV meningitis, no cases of
meningitis with other organisms, 495 cases of clinical
aseptic meningitis and 74 cases of possible aseptic menin-
gitis in 802 patients (including 129 outpatients). The sea-
sonal distribution of the cases is shown in Figure 1. Most
of the proven EV meningitis and clinical aseptic meningi-
tis occurred from July to October with sporadic cases in
other months. An outbreak of aseptic meningitis in the

province of Alberta in the summer of 1998 contributed
52% of all cases (Table 1).
Of the 802 patients, 87% (n = 699) had no underlying
medical conditions, 9.4% (n = 75) had reactive airway dis-
ease, 2.5% (n = 20) had chronic oral or inhaled corticos-
teroid use, 3.7% (n = 37) had pre-existing neurological
disease, 2.7% (n = 22) had psychiatric disease including
attention deficit disorder, 1.3% (n = 10) had renal disease,
1.1% (n = 9) had cardiac disease, and < 1% had immun-
odeficiency (n = 6), malignancy (n = 5), hematologic dis-
ease (n = 3), developmental delay (n = 2), diabetes
mellitus (n = 1) or congenital adrenal insufficiency (n =
1). The majority of patients were male (60.5%) and the
mean age ± SD was 7.3 ± 5.4 years.
Clinical presentation
Symptoms suggestive of central nervous system infection
(headache, nausea, vomiting, meningismus and/or pho-
tophobia) were seen more frequently in children 5 years
of age and older (99% of older children had these symp-
toms versus 55% of younger children) (Figure 2) (P <
0.001). However, non-specific symptoms (rash, diarrhea
and/or cough) were seen more frequently in children less
than 5 years of age (19.3%, 19.6%, 21.4% respectively
with 47% having at least one of these symptoms) than in
the older children (2.0%, 6.3%, 12.5% respectively with
21% having at least one of these symptoms) (P < 0.001).
None of the infants presented with enteroviral sepsis syn-
drome. The mean temperature at presentation was 38.0 ±
0.9°C with a temperature of ≥ 38.0°C in 409 (54.9%) of
the 745 children where it was documented. The mean
temperature at presentation for children < 5 years of age
was 38.4°C versus 37.8°C for those ≥ 5 years of age (P <
0.001).

Investigations
At least one lumbar puncture was attempted in 788 of the
802 patients (98.3%). Eight of the 74 cases of possible
aseptic meningitis had unsuccessful lumbar puncture, and
14 patients did not have the procedure attempted. Analyz-
ing the 233 cases of proven EV meningitis, 22 patients
(9.4%) had normal CSF WBC including 10 of the 31
patients (32.3%) from the < 30-day-old group, 4 of the 19
patients (21.1%) from the 30 to 60 day old group, and 8
of the 182 patients ≥ 61 days old (4.4%) (p < 0.001).
Fourteen of the 30 CSF samples (46.7%) from patients <
30 days old and 86 of the 196 CSF samples (44.9%) from
patients ≥ 30 days old with proven EV meningitis had
abnormal protein (p = 0.8), and most of the cases in all
three age groups (where serum glucose was available) had
abnormal CSF glucose (148/177, 83.6%). By definition,
all 495 cases of clinical aseptic meningitis had abnormal
CSF WBC, 234 cases (47.3%) had abnormal CSF protein
and 289 of 382 cases with blood glucose results available
(75.7%) had abnormal CSF glucose.
Enteroviridae was the only family of viruses identified in
CSF samples (Table 1). Samples from non-CSF sites iden-
tified respiratory viruses including 1 influenza A, 1 aden-
ovirus, 1 parainfluenza virus and 2 respiratory syncytial
viruses from 5 patients who fulfilled the criteria of clinical
aseptic meningitis with abnormal WBC in their CSF. Viral
culture was performed on the CSF of 389 patients
(48.5%) and 154 of 389 (38.7%) were positive. The pre-
dominant isolate was echovirus 30 (N = 68), with this
being most evident in the western sites in the first year of
the study. The 2 hospital sites that performed the highest
number of viral cultures on CSF had the highest positive
recovery rate: 53.4% (55/103) and 53.7% (43/80) respec-
tively. The positive culture rates varied from 5.4% (2/37)
to 48.5% (32/66) at the other 6 sites. Nucleic acid ampli-
fication test for enterovirus was positive in 81/149
(54.4%) patients with CSF from 19 of these patients pos-
itive by viral culture, 35 negative by viral culture and 27
not tested by viral culture. Six patients had positive CSF
culture but negative EV NAT (4 enterovirus of unspecific

type and 2 echovirus 30). Twenty-seven patients had a
positive EV culture from either a throat swab or stool cul-
ture. Of these, 6 patients also had positive CSF culture for
enterovirus, 3 had positive CSF EV NAT, 9 had negative
CSF culture or EV NAT, and 9 had no viral investigations
performed on the CSF.
Diagnostic imaging of the head was performed on 158 of
802 (19.7%) of children. Twenty-seven percent (43/158)
of these examinations were abnormal (Table 2). Children
who had proven EV meningitis were less likely to have
diagnostic imaging than were those with clinical aseptic
meningitis or possible aseptic meningitis (14.2% versus
20.8% versus 25.7%) respectively, (P < 0.05) or to have
abnormal findings other than pre-existing anatomical
anomalies or sinusitis (0.0% versus 3.0% versus 6.8%).
Acyclovir was administered to 9 patients (3.9%) with
proven EV meningitis (median age = 33 days, range: 4
days-16.7 years), 23 patients (4.6%) with clinical aseptic
meningitis (median age = 5.7 years, range: 26 days-12.1
years) and 5 patients (6.8%) with possible aseptic menin-
gitis (p = 0.5) (median age = 7.0 years, range: 39 days-17.0
years) (P > 0.05). Antibiotics were used as part of the ini-
tial management of meningitis in 594 patients (74.1%)
and corticosteroids in 25 patients (3.1%).
A total of 673 patients were admitted to hospital for a
median LOS of 2 days. The median length of stay did not
vary from 2 days in children with proven enteroviral, clin-
ical aseptic, or possible aseptic meningitis and was not
altered by the availability of viral culture or EV NAT. How-
ever, LOS ranged from 2 to 4 days at the 8 hospital sites (P
< 0.001).
Seventeen of the 802 patients (2.1%) were admitted to the
ICU including 2 of the infants < 30 days of age and 5
patients were ventilated. Only one of these patients had
proven EV meningitis (a child with a CSF shunt who
required ventilation for one day). Possible sequelae were
documented for 2 of the 233 patients with proven EV
meningitis: a one-month old child had an abnormal
evoked potential in the right ear and a 7-year-old child
developed aplastic anemia. There were no deaths.
Discussion
In this large Canadian study of children from 8 urban sites
across the country, 802 cases of pediatric aseptic meningi-
tis were identified over a two-year period. Although not
population-based, we are confident that our study cap-
tured all inpatient cases at the eight pediatric sites from
across the country, which account for the majority of ter-
tiary care pediatric beds in Canada.
Meningismus or photophobia was almost universal in
older children but only identified in about half of younger
children while rash, diarrhea or cough occurred in about
one-quarter of older and one-half of younger children.
However, lumbar punctures are more frequently per-
formed on young children even in the absence of signs of
meningitis and older children with rash, diarrhea, or
cough may not have had examination of the CSF.
Neonates with proven EV meningitis and no CSF pleocy-
tosis were identified in this study. Similarly, in a previous
study where EV NAT was performed on all CSF obtained
during EV season, 19% of all cases of proven EV meningi-
tis and 42% of cases in infants < 2 months of age had no
CSF pleocytosis [5]. It is not clear if this tendency for
infants with EV meningitis to have normal CSF WBC is
because of the lower threshold for doing a lumbar punc-
ture in this age group, or because the normal values for
CSF WBC used in this and previous studies [5] are too
high in this age group. Support for the latter can be found
in one study that showed that 11 WBC × 106/L in the CSF
is the 90th percentile for infants < 31 days of age [6]. If a
threshold of ≥ 20 × 106/L rather than >35 × 106/L had
been used to define abnormal CSF WBC in infants < 30
days of age in the current study, 199 (85.4%) patients
with proven EV meningitis would have had abnormal
CSF, and if a threshold of ≥ 5 × 106/L CSF WBC had been
used, 218 (93.6%) of patients would have had abnormal
CSF WBC.
Enteroviruses accounted for one-third of the total cases of
aseptic meningitis, and about one half of the cases where
viral cultures or EV NAT were performed on CSF. Echovi-
ruses accounted for more than two-thirds of all EV isolates
with a predominance of echovirus 30 in the first year of
the study. This may reflect a greater propensity of this type
of enterovirus to invade the central nervous system [3].
Previous North American studies have found that 90% of
community-acquired cases of viral meningitis with a
proven etiology are due to echoviruses and group B cox-
sackie viruses [1], with group A coxsackie viruses causing
fewer than 5% of cases [9]. Echovirus 13 accounted for
only 0.16% of echovirus isolates reported to the US Cent-
ers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1970 to
2000, but then accounted for 24% of isolates in 2001, and
has now been associated with outbreaks of aseptic menin-
gitis in the United States, Japan, Europe and Israel [8,9].
We did not identify echovirus 13 in CSF in our study, but
it is possible that echovirus 13 emerged as a pathogen in
subsequent EV epidemics in Canada. Enterovirus 71 has
been associated with outbreaks of encephalitis, flaccid
paralysis, and aseptic meningitis with a high incidence of
neurological sequelae [10] and death due to cardiopul-
monary failure [11], and was isolated from non-CSF sites
from children in Quebec, Canada during the study period
[12]. A possible enterovirus 71 (serotyping could not

determine if it was 70 or 71) was isolated from two CSF
and one throat swab in the current study. The reason that
only Enteroviridae were detected in this study and that no
etiologic agents were identified in two-thirds of cases is
likely that cultures on CSF are not sensitive for other
viruses [13]. Furthermore, molecular methods for etio-
logic agents other than enterovirus, West Nile virus
(which had not been described in Canada at the time of
this study), herpes simplex virus or Mycoplasma pneumo-
niae have not been validated on CSF and are therefore not
routinely applied.
Prospective studies are required to compare patient out-
come in the presence or absence of improved viral diag-
nostics including real-time NAT. Neuroimaging was
performed in a minority of patients (most commonly in
those who did not have proven EV meningitis) and would
not have altered patient management with the possible
exception of three patients with hydrocephalus. In a pre-
vious study, two of 26 patients (8%) with aseptic menin-
gitis had abnormal CT scans of the brain [5], versus 18 of
115 patients (11.6%) in the current study. Transient CT
abnormalities were described in 40% of infants under one
year of age with EV meningitis in a study from Japan [14].
These striking differences in the incidence of abnormali-

imaging the brain.
Almost three-quarters of patients in the current study
received antibiotics, as compared with only 23% of
patients in an outbreak of EV meningitis in one centre in
Germany [15]. Although EV NAT was used in the latter
study, positive results were obtained in less than half of
patients and were not necessarily available in "real-time",
so it is unlikely that availability of NAT accounts for the
low use of antibiotics. It is possible that notification of
physicians that an EV outbreak is occurring is more effica-
cious than is use of NAT in individual cases in decreasing
the use of antibiotics.
The short-term outcome of Canadian children with asep-
tic meningitis was generally excellent. A previous study
showed that 9% of children less than 2 years of age with
aseptic meningitis had coma, complex seizures, or raised
intracranial pressure, but these features did not predict
long-term neurological sequelae [16]. None of the chil-
dren in the current study had coma, seizures that were
clearly related to meningitis, or proven raised intracranial
pressure and long-term sequelae were not assessed. Two
studies have shown subtle delays in receptive language in
children with EV meningitis in the first three months of
life [17,18] with no evidence of other long-term sequelae.
No long-term follow-up was performed in the current
study.
Conclusion
In conclusion, EV is the predominant pathogen in Cana-
dian children with aseptic meningitis, but no pathogen is
identified in the majority of cases. Absence of pleocytosis
is common in young infants with aseptic meningitis.
Future efforts at prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of this
disease must target EV to have the greatest potential
impact, but further studies are required to determine the
etiology of non-enteroviral cases.
