ABSTRACT
Telomeres play a central role in human cancer, car-
diovascular aging and possibly longevity. However,
present methods to measure telomere length are
fraught with shortcomings that limit their use.
Here, we describe a novel method to measure the
relative telomere DNA content by dot blot analysis.
In each dot, the DNA content is measured by a
DNA stain (Dx) and the telomeric DNA content is
measured with a telomeric probe (T). The T
normalized for Dx (T/Dx) of each dot is a measure
of telomere content. The method requires $20 ng of
DNA per assay. Moreover, the T/Dx data are highly
correlated linearly with mean telomere lengths
derived from Southern blots of the terminal restric-
tion fragments (r > 0.96, P < 0.0001). The method is
also simple to use, has a relatively low interassay
coefficient of variation (<6%), retains its precision
in moderately degraded DNA and can be forged
for high throughput analysis. The method might
help researchers and clinicians alike in understand-
ing risks for and extent of human diseases.
INTRODUCTION
Telomeres, the TTAGGG repeats at the ends of chromo-
somes, undergo progressive shortening in replicating cells
that lack active telomerase—the reverse transcriptase that
adds telomere repeats to the end of the chromosomes
(1,2). In these cells, telomere length is not only a record
of cell replication but it is also an index of replicative
potential. Cellular replication ﬁgures in mammalian
development, tissue maintenance and in aging; it is also
a key player in the runaway cellular replication that is the
hallmark of cancer (3,4). Accordingly, telomere dynamics
(telomere length and its shortening) have been the focus of
intense interest in both clinical and epidemiological
studies, which have primarily measured leukocyte
telomere length (LTL). These studies have established
that LTL is inversely related to age and is relatively
short in individuals who suffer from aging-related
diseases, principally atherosclerosis (5–7). Relatively
short LTL has also been found to be associated with di-
minished survival of elderly persons (8–10). Moreover,
shortened LTL is often expressed in various forms of
aplastic anemia (11).
Methods to measure telomere length/content include
Southern blot analysis of the terminal restriction
fragment (TRF) lengths (1), quantitative PCR (qPCR)
(12,13), ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) (14,15),
slot blot or dot blot analysis (16–18) and single telomere
length analysis (STELA) (19). Although these techniques
have been successfully employed in broadening under-
standing the roles of telomeres in human health and
disease, they are also fraught with shortcomings (20,21)
that have contributed to a growing debate about their
research applications and usefulness in clinical settings.
For epidemiological research, the TRF length analysis
and qPCR method are typically preferred over the other
methods, but they too display considerable problems that
limit their practical use.
Clearly, there is a growing need for a simple, speciﬁc
and sufﬁciently precise method to measure telomere length
for research and clinical purposes. This need will only
escalate with the anticipated expansions of research and
clinical applications that will require telomere length
measurements. We have developed such a method.
Based on dot blot analysis, the method requires little
amount of DNA ($20 ng/assay), and moreover is inexpen-
sive and easy to perform.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
General procedures
In the ﬁrst set of experiments, we used leukocyte DNA
donated by 28 young and middle-age adults. As LTLs in
this group did not encompass the overall spectrum of
LTLs seen throughout the entire human lifespan, in a

second set of experiments we determined LTL in leukocyte
samples from seven newborns and seven elderly persons
(aged 90–96 years).
We isolated DNA by Gentra Puregene Blood kit
(Qiagen). The telomere probe we used for both the TRF
length analysis and dot blot analysis consisted of three CC
CTAA oligonucleotide repeats, which are complementary
to the canonical sequence of TTAGGG repeats, and it is
labeled at the 30
-end with digoxigenin (DIG).
Telomere repeats/DNA ratio by dot blot analysis
The method proceeds as follows: (i) the analysis is carried
out using DNA dot blots; (ii) the DNA content of the
sample on the blot is measured by SYBR Dx DNA Blot
Stain (S-7550, Invitrogen); (iii) the blot is hybridized with
a DIG labeled telomeric probe; and (iv) the ratio of
telomere repeats/DNA (T/Dx) is the amount of the
repeats per unit DNA.
We performed the assays as follows: DNA concentra-
tion in all samples, including those used for generation of
standards, was initially measured in solution by UV ab-
sorbance at 260 nm. DNA for the standard was from a
leukocyte sample with a mean TRF length of 7.29 kb.
DNA (3.3 ml; 20 ng/ml for samples and 5, 15, 25 and
35 ng/ml for the standard) was diluted into 16.5 ml of
denaturing solution (0.5 M NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl) and
incubated at 55
C for 30 min. Neutralizing solution
(495 ml; 0.5 M Tris–HCl, 1.5 M NaCl) was added. A posi-
tively charged nylon membrane (Roche) was soaked in
distilled water for 10 min and Bio-Dot Microﬁltration
Apparatus was assembled according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Each well was washed once with 200 ml water.
The 156 ml of neutralized sample or standard was loaded
into each well (in triplicate) and subjected to gentle
vacuum. Thereafter, each well was washed once with
200 ml 2Â saline–sodium citrate buffer (SSC), the
membrane was removed, rinsed in 2Â SSC, dried and
UV-cross-linked (UV dose = 120 mJ/cm2
) on both sides
of the membrane.
For DNA blot staining, the membrane was washed in
distilled water for 10 min, rinsed with 0.5 Â Tris–borate–
EDTA buffer (TBE) and stained with 5 ml SYBR Dx stain
(1000Â dilution in 0.5Â TBE) for 30 min. The ﬂuorescence
signal was measured by Typhoon 9400 (GE Healthcare).
The DNA amount of each sample was calculated from the
standard.
The membrane was pre-hybridized in 5Â SSC, 0.1%
Sarkosyl, 0.02% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 1%
blocking reagent (Roche) at 65
C for 2 h and hybridized
at 65
C with the telomeric probe overnight in the same
solution. The membrane was washed three times at room
temperature in 2Â SSC and 0.1% SDS each for 15 min
and once in 2Â SSC for 15 min. The DIG-labeled probe
was detected by the DIG luminescent detection procedure
using CDP-Star (Roche) and exposed on X-ray ﬁlm (21).
The amount of telomere repeats from each sample was
calculated from the standard.
Using ImageQuant, the total intensity above local back-
ground surrounding each dot was independently
determined for each of the three dots in each rectangle
shown in Figure 1a and c. The mean value of the three
dots was used for the standard curves displayed in
Figure 1b and d. For each sample, the T/Dx for each of
the three dots was independently obtained and the mean
of the three T/Dx values was derived.
Telomere Length/DNA content measurements by
Southern blot analysis of the TRFs and by qPCR
We obtained the mean TRF length using either HinfI/RsaI
or HphI/MnlI, as previously described (21). HinfI/RsaI,
which typically is used in TRF length analysis in most
laboratories, cuts the DNA within the non-canonical
subtelomeric region. However, HphI/MnlI cut the DNA
at telomere repeat variants that are in more proximal
regions of the telomeres (22). Therefore, digestion with
HinfI/RsaI usually results in a mean TRF length that is
longer by $1 kb than that resulting from HphI and MnlI
digestion (21).
Measurements of the mean TRF length were performed
as previously described (21). Brieﬂy, we ﬁrst evaluated the
DNA integrity by SYBR Green I, after resolving each
sample (10 ng) on 1% agarose gel at 200 V for 60 min.
Thereafter, samples were digested with restriction
enzymes Hinf I (10 U) and Rsa I (10 U; Roche) or HphI
(3.1 U)/MnlI (3.1 U) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA,
USA). DNA samples (3 mg each), and DNA ladders (1 kb
DNA ladder plus  DNA/Hind III fragments; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) were resolved on 0.5% agarose gels
for most subjects and on a 0.6% agarose gels for subjects
90–96 years (20 cm Â 20 cm) at 50 V (GNA-200 Pharmacia
Biotech). After 16 h, the DNA was depurinated for 15 min
in 0.25 N HCl, denatured 30 min in 0.5 M NaOH/1.5 mol/l
NaCl and neutralized for 30 min in 0.5 M Tris, pH 8/1.5 M
NaCl. The DNA was transferred for 1 h to a positively
charged nylon membrane (Roche) using a vacuum
blotter (Boeckel Scientiﬁc, Feasterville, PA, USA).
Thereafter, membranes were hybridized at 65
C with the
DIG-labelled telomeric probe overnight in 5 x SSC, 0.1%
Sarkosyl, 0.02% SDS and 1% blocking reagent (Roche).
The membranes were washed three times at room tem-
perature in 2Â SSC, 0.1% SDS each for 15 min and
once in 2Â SSC for 15 min. The DIG-labeled probe was
detected by the DIG luminescent detection procedure
(Roche) and exposed on X-ray ﬁlm. All autoradiographs
were scanned, and the TRF signal was digitized. The
optical density values versus DNA migration distances
were converted to optical density (adjusted for back-
ground)/molecular weight versus molecular weight (21).
The measurement of telomere repeats by qPCR
provides the ratio of the telomeric product (T) normalized
for a single-copy gene product (S) (12,13). This measure-
ment was performed as previously described (23), using
minor modiﬁcations of the original method (12) and
b-globin as S.
Each of the data points described in Figures 2 and 3
represents (i) the mean of two different runs for the mean
TRF length (one measure/run); (ii) the mean of two T/Dx
runs (three measures/run); and (iii) the mean of three T/S
runs (three measures/run). The coefﬁcient of variations
for the intraassay and interassay measurements were
e84 Nucleic Acids Research, 2011, Vol. 39, No. 12 PAGE 2 OF 7
computed as the ratios of the standard deviation (SD) to
the mean of measurements performed on the same run and
the mean of measurements performed on different runs,
respectively.

RESULTS
Figure 1 displays dot blot staining of SYBR Dx (a) and
the telomere signal (c) of triplicate samples. Clearly, at the
range of 5–35 ng the standard curves of both the SYBR
Dx dye (b) and the telomere signals (d) are highly linear.
The intraassay coefﬁcient of variations (%) of triplicate
samples (analyzed at the same time) were: T = 4.4,
Dx = 2.6, T/Dx = 5.4 (N = 56). The interassay coefﬁcient
of variation of T/Dx for samples analyzed on different
days was 5.7 (N = 28).
Figure 2 shows the relations of T/Dx and T/S with
mean TRF length generated either by HinfI/RsaI or
HphI/MnlI. For the T/Dx (a and b), strong correlations
are observed with mean TRF length regardless of the
restriction enzymes used to generate the TRFs. Strong
correlations are also observed for the relation of T/S
(c and d), with the mean TRF length, although the cor-
relations are not as robust as those between T/Dx and the
mean TRF length, particularly for the HinfI/RsaI product.
Both the present dot blot analysis and the qPCR-based
methods measure only the canonical part of the telomeres,
which consist of strictly TTAGGG repeats. In contrast,
the TRF length generated by the Southern blots includes
both the canonical and non-canonical region extending to
the nearest restriction site. Estimates of the extrapolated
non-canonical regions can be obtained from the regres-
sions displayed in Figure 2 when T/Dx = 0 or T/S = 0,
with the assumption that linearity of the regressions is
maintained beyond the empirical data. Accordingly, for
TRFs generated by HinfI/RsaI, when T/Dx = 0, mean
TRF = 1.65 kb; for TRFs generated by HphI/MnlI,
when T/Dx = 0, mean TRF = 0.805 kb. However, for
TRFs generated by HinfI/RsaI, when T/S = 0, mean
TRF = 4.71 kb; for TRFs generated by HphI/MnlI,
when T/S = 0, mean TRF = 3.36 kb. These differences
in the extrapolated lengths of the non-canonical segment
of the TRFs probably stem from deviation from linearity
of relation between T/S versus mean TRF length
(Figure 2c and d), which is already observed for the em-
pirical data of the regressions displayed in Figure 2c and
Figure 1. Dot blot staining of SYBR Dx and the telomere (TTAGGG) signal. (a) The SYBR Dx dot blot staining of different samples in triplicate.

d. This ﬁnding has been shown by others (12,13,24). The
underlying causes are not certain but we presume that they
relate to problems with the PCR of S, T or both.
The data displayed in Figure 2 do not cover the entire
spectrum of LTL seen throughout the entire human
lifespan. For this reason, in a second set of experiments
we measured LTL (by dot blot analysis and Southern
blots of the TRFs generated by HinfI/RsaI) in leukocytes
from newborns and exceptionally old persons. Figure 3
consists of data derived from results generated in the
ﬁrst set of experiments (Figure 2a) and the second set of
experiments. Clearly, the linear relation between the mean
TRF and the T/Dx is maintained in leukocytes from
donors whose age range essentially covers the entire
human lifespan.
The effect of DNA degradation on the TRF length and
the T/Dx measurements is shown in Figure 4. DNA was
degraded by sonication (Ultrasonic Processor XL2020,
microtip probe) and integrity determined (using SYBR
Green I) by resolving 10 ng DNA on 1% (wt/vol)
agarose gel at 200 V for 60 min (a). Moderate DNA deg-
radation, where the DNA crown is still compact but a

long tail of DNA smear is observed, already compromises
any meaningful analysis of the TRFs. That is because the
TRFs are considerably shortened, so that the TRF smear
extends to the edge of the gel (b), outside the routine
scanning region of the TRFs, which rarely extends lower
than 1.2 kb (6). More degradation further exacerbates this
effect. In contrast, The T/Dx results are not modiﬁed by
moderate DNA degradation (c). However, more severe
DNA degradation caused 7–8% decline in the T/Dx
values, probably because the stretches of telomere
repeats become too short for an effective annealing of
the telomere probe.
DISCUSSION
Among the methods that measure telomere length or
DNA content, the qPCR (12,13) and to a lesser extent
the Southern blots of the TRFs (1,21) have been the
main techniques used in epidemiological research. The
FISH method to measure telomere content (14,15)
requires intact nuclei and samples must be processed
within a short amount of time. Although STELA (19) is
an ingenious approach to measure telomere length, it is a
complex method with limited application for large-scale
epidemiological studies and in clinical settings.
Telomere DNA content has also been measured in slot/
dot blot analysis by normalizing for alphoid centromere
repeats (16,17). However, the length of alphoid centromer-
ic repeats is highly variable among individuals (26).
Moreover, in those few published works in which this
method has been employed, the measurements of telomer-
ic content and centromeric content were performed in du-
plicate blots (one for telomeric content and the other for
centromeric content) (16) or in the same blot in which the
hybridization with the telomeric probe was followed by
stripping the probe and re-hybridizing with the centromer-
ic probe (17). These approaches increase the measurement
error because the DNA input in the different blots and
different slots/dots might not be precisely the same. Also
stripping the membranes and re-probing may raise the
background signal, resulting in an increase in the meas-
urement error.
One report described dot blot analysis in which
telomere DNA content on the blots was normalized for
total DNA measured in solution by PicoGreen of samples
applied to the blots (18). The following are three intrinsic
errors that take place when the DNA content is measured
in solution while the telomere DNA is quantiﬁed on the
blot. The ﬁrst error is in the measurement of DNA itself.
No matter how accurate the measurement in solution
might be, it has its own intrinsic error, including a poten-
tial shift in the DNA standard on different runs, which
would increase the interassay variation. The second error
level is the fact that small amounts of DNA might adhere
to the walls of tubes, pipette tips and the blot apparatus.
Thus, the amount of DNA actually in the dot is not the
amount that is presumed to be pipetted onto it. The third
error level is in the pipetting into the dot; again, no matter
how accurate this pipetting might be, the DNA input still
varies for different dots. Together, these three tiers of
error introduce considerable variation to the results.
Our approach avoids these errors altogether by taking
advantage of the unique feature of the SYBR Dx DNA
Blot Stain to measure the total DNA content in the dot
without interference with the hybridization of the telomere
probe. Such a feature enables measuring the relative
amount of telomere DNA content to total DNA in the
dot itself regardless of the extent of the error in the input

blots. Data displayed in the ﬁgure are a composite of data displayed
in Figure 2 plus an additional set of measurements in leukocytes from
newborns and exceptionally old persons.

DNA. This applies to the standard and the samples.
For instance, suppose that the true DNA content in
a given dot is <20% what one thinks it is, the
telomere DNA signal will also be proportionally lower
by 20%. Therefore, the ratio between the telomere
DNA signal and the total DNA signal, which is the
measure of telomere content in the sample, would not
be affected.
Normalizing the telomeric content for the DNA content
of a given sample is based on the premise that the amount
of DNA in nuclei of somatic cells is constant. Thus, T/Dx
provides a measure of mean telomere per DNA content in
a sample. Such a conclusion is reasonable provided that
the amount of telomeric DNA is within the discernible
range of the method and the DNA does not contain
large amounts of heterogeneous telomere-like sequences
within its bulk. This is apparently the case for human
DNA and other mammals. The DNA content doubles in
cells undergoing mitosis, but so does the amount of
telomere repeats. Therefore, the T/Dx ratio is still
constant in mitotic cells. In addition, females have two
X chromosomes, while males have only one X chromo-
some and the much smaller Y chromosome. In principle,
the nuclei of females should have more DNA, but evident-
ly this effect is small, amounting to a difference of $1.6%
(25). If future large-scale studies show that the sex differ-
ence in DNA content impacts the T/Dx ratio in relation to
indices of interest, a sex adjustment factor can be
introduced or standard curves can be developed separately
for females and males.
We underscore the following features of the T/Dx
approach:
(i) The SYBR Dx DNA stain is used to quantify
single-stranded DNA directly on the dot itself.
(ii) The SYBR Dx DNA Blot Stain does not interfere
with the telomeric probe hybridization, as
indicated in the ‘Product Information’ of the
SYBR Dx DNA Blot Stain (Invitrogen).
(iii) The detections of both DNA and telomeric signals
are performed within their linear ranges.
(iv) The measurement of DNA content is completed
within 1 h.
(v) Small quantities of DNA ($20 ng and as little as
5 ng) are used per dot, yet the analysis does not
rely on PCR.
(vi) The method only measures the canonical compo-
nent of telomeres.
(vii) Moderate DNA degradation has no effect on the
T/Dx ratio.
(viii) The method can be forged for high-throughput
analysis.
It is useful to compare these features with those of the
Southern blot analysis of the TRFs and the qPCR method
to measure telomere DNA content.
Considered the gold standard of telomere length meas-
urement, the Southern blot analysis of TRF lengths
provides in absolute values (kb) the entire distribution of
telomere lengths in the DNA sample. The TRF analysis
requires a large amount of DNA ($2.5 mg per assay) and is
labor intensive and costly; it also requires a considerable
degree of expertise (21). Since the TRFs include the
non-canonical portion of telomeres up to the nearest re-
striction site, in theory, polymorphisms in these sites
might impact the ﬁndings. Of importance, DNA integrity
is essential for obtaining reliable results.
The qPCR method normalizes T for S and it measures
the mean content of the canonical component of telo-
meres. The method is high throughput, relatively inexpen-
sive and like the dot blot method, it requires little DNA
($20 ng per assay). However, confounders that affect the
telomere and reference signals are poorly understood. For
instance, regardless of which gene is used as a reference S,
copy number variations might affect the ﬁndings.
Moreover, the PCR might amplify any measurement
error.
Like the qPCR and FISH techniques, the dot blot
analysis measures telomere DNA content in relative
units rather than in units of telomere length (kb). The
relation between the mean TRF length and the qPCR
results (T/S) is nonlinear. Therefore, expressing the T/S
to telomere length (in kb) based on a linear model
would generate a considerable distortion in the results.
In principle, the dot blot results (T/Dx) can be expressed
in unit telomere length based on linear models. This
entails generating for each study cohort a formula that
expresses the correlation between the mean TRF length
and the T/Dx based on a reference panel of DNA
samples with known mean TRFs across the expected
range of telomere lengths for that cohort. However, little
is known about the impact of potential polymorphism in
the restriction sites on the mean TRF length. It is possible,
therefore, that DNA panels from different individuals
might show slightly different association between the
mean TRF length and T/Dx, but we anticipate that this
effect will be small.
A major shortcoming of the T/Dx method is that it
cannot be applied to various forms of cancer.
Hematopoietic malignancies and solid cancers display an
array of DNA changes, including deletions and ampliﬁca-
tions of genes and chromosomal segments, which would
alter the DNA content. This might also apply to the qPCR
method.
Finally, the lack of an optimal method to measure
telomere length has frustrated efforts to translate the
knowledge generated by basic and epidemiological
telomere research to answer practical and pressing ques-
tions in the clinical domain. The measurement of the true
telomere length or content, like the measurement of any
parameter, is a standard that can only be approached
asymptotically. That said, in the future telomere length
measurement methods, tailored to meet speciﬁc needs,
will be central to screening programs to detect persons
with short (or long) telomeres and enable the biomedical
community to gain vital information above and be-
yond conventional biomarkers about persons at risk for
cardiovascular disease and premature death. This know-
ledge might ultimately guide preventive and therapeutic
interventions deﬁned by the new era of personalized
medicine.
