In man, hematologic abnormalities precede the development of acute myeloblastic leukemia in about one-
third of individuals. This preleukemic state may represent a stage of adult leukemia wherein small numbers
of leukemic cells are present and the normal marrow stem cell compartment has not been seriously
compromised. A syndrome resembling human preleukemia occurs in cats infected with feline leukemia virus
(FeLV). This disorder is characterized by anemia, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia occurring weeks or
months prior to the development of feline acute leukemia. The natural occurrence of this syndrome in this
domestic animal population makes it a potential model of human preleukemia. Initial poor results of
therapy of human preleukemia presently prohibit one from carrying out controlled trials with chemother-
apeutic agents in such a group of patients. Preliminary trials with chemo- and/or immunotherapy may be
more easily attempted with FeLV infected preleukemic cats.
INTRODUCTION
Lymphoid neoplasia is the most commonly occurring malignancy in domestic cats,
accounting for at least 1/3 of the malignant tumors in this species [1,2]. One
epidemiologic study estimated the incidence of feline lymphoid malignancies as being
200 cases/ 100,000 cats in the population at risk [3]. This incidence is considerably
higher than that of leukemia in man or in other domestic animals. The term "feline
leukemia"' is used in much of the literature to describe a leukemia-lymphoma
complex. In most instances the principal cell type involved is lymphoid in origin but
myeloproliferative disorders (myelogenous leukemia, erythroleukemia, monocytic
leukemia, and polycythemia vera) have also been described [4-10].
The suggestion that feline leukemia may be caused by a virus was first provided by
Jarrett and his co-workers in 1964 [11]. These investigators induced lymphosarcoma
in newborn kittens by injecting cell suspensions from a naturally occurring feline
mediastinal lymphoma. The kittens developed lymphosarcoma after periods of time
ranging from nine to 18 months. Electron microscopic examination of this tumor

tissue revealed C-type virus-like particles similar to those associated with avian and
murine leukemia [11]. It soon became apparent that a contagious and oncogenic
feline leukemia virus (FeLV) was responsible for the majority of naturally occurring
feline lymphoid malignancies [12-15]. In 1970 a simple immunofluorescent test was
developed for the detection of viral group-specific antigens in the leukocytes and
platelets of viremic cats [15]. These antigens are present in 70 to 90% of cats with
naturally occurring lymphoma and leukemia [16-18]. A positive result by immuno-
fluorescence correlates well with virus isolation in tissue culture [15]. FeLV also has
an effect on non-hematopoietic tissues. Investigators have observed thymic atrophy,
lymphoid depletion and an apparent increased susceptibility to infection in cats
inoculated with FeLV [18,19]. The viremic, potentially leukemic cat has been shown
to have an altered cell mediated immune response and perhaps an altered humoral
response as well. Other diseases have been associated with FeLV infection including
feline infectious peritonitis, glomerulonephritis, spontaneous abortion, fetal resorp-
tion, and nonregenerative anemia [16,20,21].
Two classes of antigens have been described in association with FeLV infected
cells: (a) the non-virion viral specific cell surface antigen (Feline Oncornavirus Cell
Membrane Antigen, FOCMA) that appears on the surface membrane of FeLV
transformed cells, and (b) the virion type specific antigens associated with the viral
envelope. The FOCMA antibody titer and neutralizing antibody titer can be
measured in viremic cats. The specificity of the FOCMA antibody has been
documented experimentally with various strains of feline oncorna viruses [22-24].
Viremic, leukemic cats have low FOCMA and neutralizing antibody titers. FOCMA
is not present in normal peripheral blood, bone marrow or lymphoid tissue until
these cells are transformed into neoplastic cells and FOCMA is thought to be a tumor
specific antigen [25].
Anemia observed in FeLV infected cats may occur coincidentally with the
development of a solid lymphosarcoma, and of lymphoid and myeloid leukemia.
Nonregenerative anemia in the viremic cat, unassociated with neoplasia, may
progress to leukemia. Due to the poor prognosis, cats with hypoplastic anemias are
terminated and transition to acute leukemia is rarely seen. In some instances when
supportive therapy is administered or when the animal stabilizes spontaneously, a
lymphoproliferative or myeloproliferative disorder may evolve. Not all FeLV
positive anemic animals progress to leukemia and viremic cats may remain hemato-
logically and clinically normal for long periods of time [26]. In a prospective study of
148 clinically normal FeLV positive cats, 7.5% expired with severe anemia while
16.2% developed histologically confirmed lymphosarcoma in a two-year period [27].
As occurs in man, some animals may expire in a preleukemic stage of disease due to
the systemic manifestations of anemia.
In man the hematologic abnormalities that precede the development of acute
myeloblastic leukemia have recently been categorized into a recognizable syndrome
that may be appropriately labeled "preleukemia" [28-31]. Although once thought to
be a rare occurrence, an initial preleukemic phase was documented in 1/3 of
individuals in a study of 132 patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia [29]. On
the other hand, a preleukemic syndrome has been described only rarely as a
harbinger of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia of childhood [32]. This entity is
attracting increased interest and multiple authors have different definitions of a
criteria for the identification of the preleukemic syndrome. Many believe that the
diagnosis of preleukemia can be made only retrospectively. Human preleukemia may
represent a stage of adult leukemia where small numbers of leukemic cells are present

and where the normal marrow stem cell compartment has not been seriously
compromised in size or function. It has been suggested that the preleukemic state
might be an appropriate setting for testing the hypothesis that chemotherapy and/or
immunotherapy is most effective when the tumor cell load is small [30]. Initial
attempts at aggressive therapy during this phase of disease have proven disastrous
and have been discouraged by several investigators [33]. These results make it
difficult to undertake controlled trials with chemotherapeutic agents in man.
Preliminary studies may be more easily undertaken if an appropriate animal model
for the development of the preleukemic state existed.
This paper describes a naturally occurring syndrome in domestic cats that
resembles human preleukemia. These animals manifested hematologic abnormalities
for variable periods of time prior to the development of overt leukemia. This
syndrome appears to be an appropriate model for further investigation of the
preleukemic state in man.
CLINICAL DESCRIPTION OF FELINE PRELEUKEMIA
We have had the opportunity to document the clinical course of twelve domestic
FeLV + anemic cats presenting to the University of Pennsylvania School of Veteri-
nary Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Animal Medical Center, New York,
New York, and the Angell Memorial Animal Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts. Each
animal presented with unexplained cytopenias and/ or refractory anemia prior to the
development of overt leukemia (Table 1).
The population included nine males and three females. Ten of the twelve animals
were young adults (4 years old or less) with the oldest animal being 13 years old.
Animals were referred for evaluation of lethargy, anorexia and weight loss of up to
six months duration. Physical findings were remarkable for mucous membrane
pallor (8/12), fever (8/12), and hepatosplenomegaly (6/12). Hematological evalua-
tion included determination of complete blood counts, reticulocyte counts, estimated
platelet numbers and evaluation of bone marrow aspirations from the dorsal iliac
crest.

All twelve animals were anemic (mean hematocrit of 14.5%) and the anemia was
severe in four animals (Table 2). Although macrocytosis without polychromasia was
occasionally evident on the peripheral blood smear, normochromic, normocytic red
blood cell (RBC) morphology was the rule. Nucleated RBC precursors, some of
which were megaloblastoid, were commonly observed (10/12). Reticulocytosis was
noted in three cats at presentation but they later reverted to reticulocytopenia. All
other animals presented with depressed reticulocyte counts. The white blood cell
(WBC) abnormalities at presentation were confined to leukopenia (mean WBC of
6.4 x 103/cumm) with granulocytopenia. One animal, however, presented with a
wwbc of 33,900/mm3 (Table 2). Atypical lymphocytes and blast forms were present
(2 to 9%) in the blood of two of twelve cats during the preleukemic anemic phase.
Platelet numbers were variable. Large platelets with bizarre morphology were seen in
three cats with thrombocytosis. Bleeding tendencies were not observed. Only two of
the twelve cats were FeLV negative when they presented with anemia. These two
animals became viremic when they developed overt leukemia.
Bone marrow aspirates were examined during the preleukemic phase of disease in
eight cats (Table 3). Cellularity was normal in marrows offour cats, decreased in that
of three cats and increased in the aspirate of one cat which later developed
myelogenous leukemia. Erythroid hypoplasia with maintenance of other cellular
elements was observed in the marrow of three animals while pancytopenia was noted
in that of two other cats. Erythroid maturation was megaloblastoid in some
instances. Mild to moderate lymphocytosis was noted in four of eight aspirates. Bone
marrow aspirates were infiltrated with blast forms in all animals when overt leukemia
was diagnosed. As noted in Table 1, blasts were most often lymphoid in morphology
(9/12), although the marrow findings of both erythroleukemia and myelogenous
leukemia were also observed.

leukemia varied from one week to 33 months (Table 1). During this period, all
animals were given some form of therapy. Blood transfusions (cases 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10,
12), anabolic steroids (cases 3, 8, 9, 10, 12), corticosteroids (cases 5, 8, 10, 11), and
intralymphatic BCG (case 8) were administered. Following the diagnosis of overt
leukemia, animals were most often sacrificed at the request of their owners. The
remaining few, in which therapy was attempted, died two to three weeks later.
Necropsies were performed on nine animals and blast cell invasion of bone
marrow, liver and spleen was noted. In addition, neoplastic involvement of the
kidney (cases 10, 12), lymph nodes (cases 6, 10, 11), heart (case 10), and eye (case 10)
was recorded.
DISCUSSION
Observations to date leave little doubt as to the existence of a recognizable
hematologic syndrome preceding the development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia
in man [28-31]. This syndrome has been designated the "preleukemic syndrome" and
is not a separate entity or a specific disease but is rather a stage in a multiphasic
leukemic disorder. The duration of preleukemia is variable and it is likely that this
reflects differences in host responses rather than different pathogenic mechanisms.
We report a preleukemic disorder in FeLV positive cats that resembles that
described in man. The similarities of feline preleukemia and human "prelymphoblas-
tic" leukemia are evident. Although feline leukemia is most often lymphoid in nature,
there is also a striking resemblance between this preleukemic disorder and the
syndrome that frequently precedes the development of human acute nonlymphoblas-
tic leukemia. Murine leukemia has been utilized by many investigators as a model
for human disease but this occurs in highly inbred, artificially maintained laboratory
animals and produces solid tumors rather than a true leukemia. Feline leukemia may
be a more appropriate model for human leukemia due to its natural occurrence and
its restriction to the bone marrow and lymphoid tissues in a domestic population
[34]. The appearance of cytopenias and refractory anemia in feline preleukemia is
similar to the situation in man.
Feline leukemia offers the investigator an unusual opportunity to observe a
leukemia while its manifestations evolve. Nonregenerative anemia has been experi-
mentally produced in young kittens inoculated with the Kawakami-Theilen (KT)
strain of feline leukemia virus [35,36]. It is possible that if supported through their
473

anemic phase, many of these animals may develop lymphosarcoma or some form of
leukemia. Serological studies allow identification of FeLV + animals with a high risk
of developing acute leukemia. Extensive studies have been performed on the
immunological response to FeLV infection [37-39]. Exposure of cats to FeLV results
in the expression of FOCMA after contact exposure to virus under laboratory and
field conditions [22]. The levels of FOCMA antibody have been shown to be
predictive for tumor occurrence and growth. Animals with high FOCMA antibody
titers are less likely to develop tumors [23,35,38]. The humoral response to FOCMA
may function as an immunosurveillance mechanism and may prevent the develop-
ment of leukemia following infection with FeLV under natural conditions.
The accumulation of evidence for a dominant role of cellular immune mechanisms
in tumor rejection [40,41] and the observation that humoral antibodies may enhance
rather than inhibit tumor growth [42,43] have led to the premature dismissal of the
therapeutic role of antibodies directed against tumor associated antigens expressed
on tumor cells. The effect of antiserum treatment on the growth of allogenic tumors
has been extensively investigated [42,43]. Both active and passive immunization
resulted in either enhancement or inhibition of tumor growth, depending upon the
conditions of the immunization. Sporadic reports suggesting the potential benefit of
serotherapy in the treatment of human malignancy have been published but remain
unsubstantiated [44-46]. Such studies in man may be premature pending the
isolation of a truly tumor-specific antigen. The feline preleukemic state may be an
ideal situation in which to test the effect of serotherapy on a naturally occurring
tumor. FOCMA is a well defined tumor specific antigen and the levels of FOCMA
antibody are associated with protection against tumor development [22]. The
administration of FOCMA antibody rich serum to cats with preleukemia may allow
for the observation ofthe effect of serotherapy on animals with a relatively low tumor
burden. It would be important to know whether or not such therapy may be
combined with chemotherapy or immunotherapy to stimulate cell mediated immu-
nity.
The role of intensive chemotherapy in human preleukemia is unknown. Anecdotal
reports have suggested that such intervention has met with disaster [33]. Studies
designed to test a variety of agents in feline preleukemia would allow the chemother-
apist the opportunity to alter the course of naturally occurring preleukemia. At
present similar studies in man are unethical insofar as preleukemic individuals may
survive long periods of time with supportive care alone.
This report describes a feline preleukemic syndrome that closely resembles human
preleukemia. This animal model of human disease will hopefully be useful to
virologists, tumor biologists, and experimental chemotherapists.
