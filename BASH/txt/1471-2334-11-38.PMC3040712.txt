Abstract
Background: Children born to HIV+ mothers are exposed intra-utero to several drugs and cytokines that can
modify the developing immune system, and influence the newborn’s immune response to infections and vaccines.
We analyzed the relation between the distribution of cord blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokine profile in term
newborns of HIV+ mothers using HAART during pregnancy and compared them to normal newborns.
Methods: In a prospective, controlled study, 36 mother-child pairs from HIV+ mothers and 15 HIV-uninfected
mothers were studied. Hematological features and cytokine profiles of mothers at 35 weeks of pregnancy were
examined. Maternal and cord lymphocyte subsets as well as B-cell maturation in cord blood were analyzed by flow
cytometry. The non-stimulated, as well as BCG- and PHA-stimulated production of IL2, IL4, IL7, IL10, IL12, IFN-g and
TNF-alpha in mononuclear cell cultures from mothers and infants were quantified using ELISA.
Results: After one year follow-up none of the exposed infants became seropositive for HIV. An increase in B
lymphocytes, especially the CD19/CD5+ ones, was observed in cord blood of HIV-exposed newborns. Children of
HIV+ hard drug using mothers had also an increase of immature B-cells. Cord blood mononuclear cells of HIV-
exposed newborns produced less IL-4 and IL-7 and more IL-10 and IFN-g in culture than those of uninfected
mothers. Cytokine values in supernatants were similar in infants and their mothers except for IFN-g and TNF-alpha
that were higher in HIV+ mothers, especially in drug abusing ones. Cord blood CD19/CD5+ lymphocytes showed a
positive correlation with cord IL-7 and IL-10. A higher maternal age and smoking was associated with a decrease
of cord blood CD4+ cells.
Conclusions: in uninfected infants born to HIV+ women, several immunological abnormalities were found, related
to the residual maternal immune changes induced by the HIV infection and those associated with antiretroviral
treatment. Maternal smoking was associated to changes in cord CD3/CD4 lymphocytes and maternal hard drug
abuse was associated with more pronounced changes in the cord B cell line.
Background
HIV infection is associated with a complex pattern of
changes in the hemopoietic and the immune systems,
resulting in abnormalities of peripheral blood (PB)
counts and changes in T and B lymphocytes. Decrease
of T helper and increase of cytotoxic lymphocytes, pro-
found changes in the cytokine profile and a variety of B
lymphocyte abnormalities have been repeatedly
described [1-4]. However, long term antiretroviral ther-
apy (ARV) is able to restore, at least in part, the
immune function [3-6].
The introduction of ARV therapy in HIV+ pregnant
women has drastically decreased vertical transmission of
HIV [1-7]. But, several changes in PB counts and T
CD4+
and CD8+
lymphocytes have been detected in
HIV-exposed uninfected newborns [1,2,4] and attributed
to alterations in maternal cytokine profile caused by the
HIV infection as well as by the ARV treatment [2,8-14].

PB count changes are soon reversed, but some T lym-
phocyte changes may last for as long as 8 years [2].
Therefore, these infants present an increased risk for
severe infections. This risk is further increased as new-
borns from HIV-infected mothers usually do not receive
breast feeding in order to avoid vertical transmission.
Changes in T lymphocytes may also affect the response
to vaccines given in the neonatal period [2,10-13].
Alterations in infants’ T lymphocyte subsets have been
well studied, but little is known about the impact of
HIV infection and highly active antiretroviral treatment
(HAART) on neonatal maturation and function of
B lymphocytes [8,15].
The aim of our study was to analyze the B cell
maturation in umbilical cord blood of infants born to
HIV-infected mothers using HAART. We also studied
the relation between the distribution of lymphocyte sub-
sets and cytokine production in short term cultures of
cord blood mononuclear cells in as well as in maternal
peripheral blood mononuclear cells at 35 weeks of preg-
nancy. We also looked for the relation between maternal
smoking and use of hard drugs during pregnancy and
infant’s lymphocyte subpopulations.
Methods
Mother-child pairs
We studied 36 mother-child pairs of HIV positive preg-
nant women attended at our High Risk Obstetric Unit.
They were >18 years old, were using HAART during
gestation and had a low or undetectable viral load. All
of them had a term delivery. None of the newborns had
a malformation at birth. Their data were compared to
15 normal mother-child pairs, which were also attended
at our Institution. Mothers of the control group were
also >18 years old, had no known pathological condi-
tion: hypertension, diabetes, obesity, autoimmune disor-
ders, infections, nor a past history of repeated infections
suggesting an underlying immunodeficiency, and had a
normal term delivery.
Peripheral blood counts as well as cytokine profile of
both groups of mothers as well as viral load of the HIV
+ ones were taken between 32 to 35 weeks of gestation.
After 13-17 months of observation none of the
exposed infants developed HIV infection. Infants were
considered HIV- uninfected and defined as seroreverters
if they had negative HIV- polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) tests at 1 and 3 months of age or became HIV-
seronegative after 13 months of age.
Cord blood analysis
Cord blood was separated at delivery and processed during
the first 24 hours after collection. Cell counts were per-
formed in the hematologic counter Advia 120 (Bayer,
Dublin - Ireland). Lymphocyte subsets were studied by
flow cytometry. T lymphocytes were analyzed in the CD4/
CD8/CD3 combination. Their number was expressed as
percentage of CD3+ cells among all cord blood nucleated
cells. B lymphopoiesis was studied in the combinations:
CD5/CD19/CD45, CD45/CD34/CD19/CD22 and sIgM/
CD34/CD19/CD10 (Figure 1). For each case, at least
50000 events were acquired using the FACSCalibur (Beck-
ton Dickinson) equipment (Cell Quest software). Analysis
was performed using the Paint-a-Gate software.
Cytokine Assays
Cytokine assays were performed in supernatants from
cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
of the mothers at 35 weeks of gestation, and infants’
cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC). In both cases,
mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque
1077 (Sigma, MO, USA). They were suspended in RPMI
1640 with 10% human serum, 1% glutamine and 0.1%
gentamicine and cultured for 48 hours with live Bacillus
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) (5 × 105
/mL), (Butantan Insti-
tute, SP), phytohemagglutinin (PHA, 7.5 μg/mL) (Sigma,
MO, USA) or in medium alone (non-stimulated).
Cytokines were quantified by enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay (ELISA) in cell-free supernatants using
commercial kits for human IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-10, IL-
12, TNF-a and IFN-g (Duo Set®
, R&D Systems Inc,
Minneapolis, MN, USA). These cytokines were chosen
as they are able to analyze Th1 and Th2 status [15].
T-cell proliferation
Cord Blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) were isolated by
density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque
(Amersham Biosciences, USA), washed, diluted to 1 ×
106
cells/mL in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, USA), sup-
plemented with 10% human AB serum (Sigma, USA), 1%
glutamine (Sigma, USA) and 0.1% gentamycin and stimu-
lated for 6 days with PHA or medium alone at 37°C with
5% CO2 96-well tissue culture plates (NUNC, Denmark).
After harvesting in 20 mM EDTA, samples were incubated
with human immunoglobulin and then stained with anti-
human CD3, CD4 and CD8 (Beckman Coulter, USA)
fluorescent antibodies before acquisition and analysis.
Only CD3+ T cells were used in the analysis. Resting and
blast lymphocytes were gated on the forward and side
scatter plot (Figure 2). Dead cells were excluded from all
analyses. CD4+ and CD8+ cells were identified in the gate
of blast lymphocytes. Proliferation was measured as per-
centage of CD3+ blasts in the PHA-stimulated well from
which basal proliferation without stimulation was sub-
tracted (PHA, Sigma, USA, 7.5 μg/mL).
Statistical Analysis
Features of the normal and HIV-exposed newborns and
their mothers were compared by the Mann-Whitney

and Kruskall-Wallis tests. Values were considered sta-
tistically significant when the two-sided p-value was <
0.05. The relationships among the features were exam-
ined by the Spearman rank order correlation test. In
order to find out which variables were related to birth
weight and the T and B cell subsets, multiple step-wise
linear regressions were run (0.05 for input and p =
0.1 for output, backward conditional stepwise selec-
tion) using the variables showing significant differences
or correlations in the univariate analysis. Moreover,
the R2 values of each regression, which represent the
goodness-of-fit of the mathematical model, were
recorded in order to estimate the approximation of the
algorithm to clinical and biological reality. Finally, the
stability of the model was tested by bootstrap resam-
pling. In this technique we create new data sets of
equal size by random sampling of the original data
with replacement [16-18]. Thus, in a new bootstrap
sample, a patient may be represented once, multiple
times or not at all. Then, for each of these “new” sets,
a linear regression is calculated and the variables
entering each of the “new” models are recorded. This
procedure tests the stability of a mathematical model,
points out the most important variables and, further-
more, permits to calculate confidence intervals (IC).
WinStat 3.1 software was used.
Ethics Approval
All mothers were invited to participate, received a com-
plete explanation about the aims of the study and writ-
ten informed consent was obtained according to our
local Ethics’s Committees (CAISM - Center of Inte-
grated Care for Women’s Health, and that of our
Faculty of Medicine).

Results
Pregnant women
The epidemiological features of the mothers entering
the study are presented in Table 1. In the control group,
only one mother was a smoker. Yet, smoking and drug
abuse (marihuana, cocaine or crack) was common
among the HIV+ ones. Both maternal groups had a
similar age and a similar time of gestation. HIV+
mothers had a cesarean section in all but one case.
Among HIV-negative mothers 11 had a vaginal and 4 a
cesarean delivery. Antiretroviral therapy included pro-
tease inhibitors in all but 3 cases. Mean time of mater-
nal HAART treatment was 5 months. Eight mothers got
pregnant while already using HAART. HIV viral load
was undetectable in 23 HIV+ mothers and low in the
remaining thirteen (Table 1).
Mothers’ PB counts are shown on Table 2. HIV+
mothers had hemoglobin values similar to that of HIV-
uninfected ones, but showed a significantly higher mean
corpuscular volume (MCV), lower total leukocyte and
neutrophil counts. The proportion of T CD4+ and
T CD8+ lymphocytes of the HIV+ mothers presented
similar values in smokers, non-smokers and drug users.
The cytokine concentrations in the supernatant of
PBMC cultures not stimulated and after stimulation
with BCG and PHA in mothers at 35 weeks of gestation
are presented on Table 3. HIV+ mothers showed lower
values of IL-4 and IL-7, but higher values of TNFa in
non-stimulated cultures. Production of IL-2 and IL-
12 by PBMCs in non-stimulated as well as stimulated
cultures were similar both in normal and HIV-infected
mothers.
The CD4/CD8 ratio in PB of HIV+ mothers showed
an inverse relation with viral load (r = -0.30; p = 0.02)
and production of TNFa by PBMCs (non-stimulated)
(r = -0.27; p = 0.04) and a direct correlation with IL-10
(r = 0.35; p = 0.01). There was no correlation with IL-7.
Figure 2 Analysis of T cell proliferation of non-stimulated (A) and PHA-stimulated (B) cord mononuclear cells of a newborn from
a HIV-infected mother. After gating of CD3 cells, events were analyzed for size and complexity (forward-scatter and side-scatter gates), from
which resting (R1-green) and blast cells (R2-blue) were separated. T-lymphocyte subsets were then analyzed. Dead cells (red) were excluded
from all analyses. T cell proliferation was the difference between the percentages of PHA-stimulated blasts and non-stimulated blasts.

In a multiple regression, we obtained the formula:
Maternal CD4/CD8 ratio = 0.946 + 5.6 × 10-5
× IL-
10 - 9.8 × 10-5
× TNFa - 0.0567 × log viral load +
0.9468 R2
= 0.335 ; p = 0.004
The stability of the model was confirmed in a boot-
strap resampling procedure. Among 100 new models,
“log viral load” entered in 97%, “IL-10” level in 89%,
“TNFa” in 60% and “IL-7” in 28% of them.
Newborns
The birth data of the newborns are described in Table 4.
Children of HIV+ mothers had a similar height but a
lower weight than those born to uninfected mothers.
Furthermore, they had lower hemoglobin levels, a higher
MCV and lower leukocyte and neutrophil counts than
non-exposed newborns. The number of days of maternal
ARV treatment during pregnancy did not influence these
values, but there was a good correlation between maternal
and cord blood red blood cells (RBCs) (r = 0.56; p <
0.0005) and MCV (r = 0.54; p < 0.0005). This was less evi-
dent concerning hemoglobin values (r = 0.21; p = 0.06).
The birth weight of HIV-exposed infants showed a
relation with the duration of maternal HAART treat-
ment during pregnancy and the TNFa production (non-
stimulated cultures) in supernatants of cultures of PB
mononuclear cells collected at the end of gestation.
Maternal age, smoking, weeks of gestation and child’s
gender had no relation to birth weight.
In a multiple regression we obtained the formula:
Birth weight = 3327 - 1.48 × days of HAART - 5 ×
unstimulated maternal TNFa p = 0.006, R2
= 0.216 ( CI
95% : 0.215 - 0.383 )
The bootstrap resampling study confirmed this result:
“days of HAART treatment” appeared in 77% and “non-
stimulated maternal TNFa at 35 weeks of gestation”
was present in 70% of the new data sets. But, “weeks of
gestation” appeared in 40%, “maternal smoking” in 38%,
“mother’s age” in 12% and “child’s gender” in 10% of the
new data sets.
The distribution of the several lymphocyte subsets in
cord blood is shown on Table 4. The percentage of CD3
+ lymphocytes in HIV-exposed newborns was increased
when compared with the non-exposed ones. The CD4/
CD8 ratio was significantly lower.

In HIV-exposed neonates the relation of the number
of cord T lymphocytes with maternal age, days of
HAART use during pregnancy, smoking and drug abuse
was examined in a multiple regression. For T CD8+ cell
no model could be obtained.
The percentage of T CD4+ cells was lower in children
from older and smoking mothers.
This percentage could be calculated by the formula:
Cord % T CD4+ cells = -0.428 × mother’s age (years)
- 4.91 (S) + 30.52;
S = 1 for smoking and 0 for non-smoking mother.
R2
= 0.242 (CI 95%: 16.6 - 51.1)
Drug abuse and days of maternal HAART treatment
during pregnancy did not enter the model. The stability
of the model for cord blood T CD4+ cells was con-
firmed in the bootstrap resampling. Among 100 new
models, “maternal age” entered in 87% and “maternal
smoking” in 72% of them. “Duration of maternal
HAART treatment” entered in 42%, and “drug abuse” in
11% of the models.
CD3, CD4 and CD8 immunophenotyping was carried
out in cell cultures of cord blood from 22 newborns
from HIV + mothers and 10 non-exposed ones. Median
background CD3+ proliferation was 9.6% (0.5-25.9) in
the HIV+ group and 10.4% (6.2-91.7) in the controls
(p = 0.44). The blast percentage in PHA-stimulated cul-
tures showed a median of 40.3% (1.5-71.6) for the HIV+
group and 54.2 (11.7-74.8) for the non-exposed controls.
The proportion of PHA-proliferating CD4+ and CD8+
cells were not different between the groups (Table 5).
Cord blood CD19+ lymphocytes (Table 6) were
increased in newborns of HIV+ mothers due to an
increase of CD19+/CD5+ cells. Children of drug users
had the highest numbers of total B lymphocytes. The
duration of HAART during pregnancy showed no corre-
lation with the total number of cord blood B-cells or
with that of CD19+/CD5+ ones.
B-cell maturation was analyzed in two four-color
combinations (Table 6). The CD45/CD34/CD19/
CD22 combination was the most useful to reveal an
increase in immature and intermediary B-precursors in
infants of HIV+ mothers. This feature was more pro-
nounced in children of drug users.
In HIV-exposed neonates, there was no significant dif-
ference in the proportion of immature cells with the
newborn’s gender (p = 0.33) or children of smokers and
non-smokers (p = 0.21), but those of drug users showed
a higher percentage (p = 0.007) (Table 6). There was no
significant correlation between this variable and gesta-
tion duration or maternal age but with the number of
days of maternal HAART use (r = 0.53; p = 0.01).
In a multiple regression, examining the relation
between the percentage of cord blood immature cells
with maternal drug abuse and the number of days of
HAART treatment during pregnancy, the proportion of

immature/intermediate (IMAT) B cells could be calcu-
lated by the formula:
% Cord IMAT B cells = 0.02 × days of HAART + B +
0.72; R2
= 0.859 (CI - 0.653 - 0.943)
With B = 12.0 for drug abusers and B = 0 for all other
mothers.
The stability of this regression model was tested by
the bootstrap resampling study, where both variables
entered in 98% of the new data sets.
The cytokine concentrations in the supernatant of
CBMC cultures (Table 7) showed a high correlation
with the values found for their mothers (Table 3),
excluding those of IFNg and TNFa. IL-4 and IL-7 pro-
duction was lower in HIV+ mothers and cord blood
mononuclear cells. Concerning IL-10, there was no sig-
nificant difference between HIV+ and HIV negative
mothers. However, HIV-exposed newborns produced
higher amounts than non-exposed, although these dif-
ferences had a low statistical significance.
Concerning TNFa, HIV+ mothers had a higher pro-
duction, especially drug users (p = 0.01). CBMCs of
HIV-exposed infants produced similar amounts of
TNFa but more IFNg than the control group. No corre-
lation was found between the number of days of mater-
nal HAART treatment during pregnancy and CBMC
cytokine production.
In non-exposed newborns, no correlation was found
between the percentage of CD19+ cells as well as CD19
+/CD5+ ones and any cytokine production in CBMCs.
However, in HIV-exposed newborns, an inverse correla-
tion was found between total cord blood CD19+ cells
and cord IL-4 and IL-7 production in non-
stimulated cultures (Table 8).

Discussion
HIV-exposed uninfected infants present a variety of
small but significant alterations compared to non-
exposed neonates such as a lower birth weight, peripheral
blood cytopenias and distribution pattern of circulating
lymphocyte subsets [1,2,4,5,10,19-25]. Their lower
birth weight has been attributed to an earlier delivery
due to a higher rate of elective cesarean section [10] or
to an earlier maternal Th2 to Th1 shift related to the
antretroviral treatment leading to a premature delivery
[15]. In our study however, the gestation period was
similar in both groups despite that HIV+ mothers
delivered by an elective cesarean section. Low weight
at birth of HIV-exposed infants was associated to a
high maternal production of TNFa at the end of preg-
nancy, which was more common in drug abusing
mothers. It has been shown that neither HAART nor
decreased IL-10 levels, but only increase in maternal
IL-2 is associated to a premature delivery [26-28]. To
the best of our knowledge there are no data in the lit-
erature about the relation between maternal IL-7 and
IL-4 and low birth weight and prematurity. In our
study, a better control of the maternal HIV infection,
expressed by an increase of the CD4/CD8 ratio, was
also associated with a lower production of TNFa and
higher one of IL-10.
In our prospective controlled trial we compared hema-
tological and immunological features of term newborns
from HIV+ women under effective HAART treatment
during pregnancy with normal unexposed newborns.
Hemoglobin, leukocyte and neutrophil counts were
lower, and MCV was higher. These alterations were
similar to those described in the literature [1,2,4,10],
and could be readily explained by maternal HAART
treatment and placental drug transfer, as it has been
already pointed out [4,25]. We could not demonstrate
an association of the intensity of the newborns’ periph-
eral cytopenias with the duration of maternal HAART
treatment, but when maternal and newborns’ PB counts
were compared, RBC and MCV showed a significant
correlation. We could not find any correlation concern-
ing leukocytes and platelets. Our study cohort was
rather small, but other factors, such as maternal nutri-
tional status or use of antibacterial medications could
have influenced the PB counts found.
We could also detect several differences in cord blood
lymphocyte sub-populations in our HIV-exposed unin-
fected newborns when compared to children from HIV
negative mothers. We studied the possible association of
these alterations with the maternal and cord blood cyto-
kine profile, duration of maternal HAART treatment as
well as maternal smoking and drug abuse.
Concerning maternal cytokine profile, HIV+ women
only differed from uninfected ones by a lower production
of IL-4 and IL-7 in culture, but more TNFa, especially in
drug using women. A decrease in the Th2 cytokine pro-
file has been described at the end of pregnancy [26]. On
the other hand, antiretroviral drugs, especially protease
inhibitors as used in the present study, have been asso-
ciated to a metabolic syndrome associated with an activa-
tion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly TNFa [27].
We may speculate that the co-occurrence of maternal
HIV-1 infection, use of HAART and hard drugs, all con-
tributed to a higher stimulation of maternal immune
cells leading to a larger baseline production of TNF-a in
short term culture. The reduced production of IL-4 and
IL-7 observed in HIV-infected mothers is in keeping with
a change in T-lymphocyte homeostasis in HIV-infected
patients.
The decrease of IL-4 and increase of IFN-g in HIV-
exposed uninfected newborns speaks in favor of an
environment with a Th1-shifted balance. This is more
pronounced in newborns of HIV+ mothers under effec-
tive HAART [4,6,11,12]. This treatment has been asso-
ciated with an at least a partial restoration of the
immune function in HIV infected children and adult
patients [19-22].
Our results confirmed previous findings of changes in
T-cell development in cord blood of uninfected new-
borns of HIV - infected mothers with undetectable or
low viral load [2,9-11]. Our HIV-exposed uninfected
newborns presented higher numbers of CD3+
cells, due
mainly to increase in CD8+
lymphocytes as is seen in
HIV-infected adults. Lower proportions of CD4+
, but
not of CD8+
T cells was also associated to a higher
maternal age and smoking. Although we examined only
a small number of patients, these findings are in keeping

with those found in adult smokers [29,30]. Therefore,
not only the maternal HIV infection could alter the thy-
mus function of exposed infants, but also maternal
smoking.
Placental transfer of HIV-related proteins and residual
maternal immune alterations could be responsible for
the findings concerning the immune function of our
HIV-exposed non-infected neonates [31,32]. On the
other hand, 11/15 of the healthy control mothers in our
study had a normal vaginal delivery, while all except one
of the HIV-infected mothers had a cesarean section.
Therefore, some differences found between HIV-
exposed and non-exposed neonates may be explained by
the different mode of delivery of both groups of new-
borns. It has been shown that normal labor induces
immune stimulation in mothers and neonates including
a higher production of TNF-a [33]. This could explain
the difference found of this cytokine in supernatants of
maternal but not in cord mononuclear cultures, as nor-
mal newborns were stimulated by labor and HIV-
exposed ones were already stimulated by the maternal
HIV infection.
The long term CBMC cultures demonstrated similar
numbers of T-derived activated cells after PHA stimula-
tion in HIV-exposed neonates and non-exposed ones.
Similar proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ cells were also
observed in HIV-exposed uninfected newborns and
unexposed ones, speaking in favor of a preserved func-
tion of these cells.
Cord blood B lymphocytes were increased in HIV-
exposed neonates, mainly caused by an increase in
CD19+/CD5+ cells. A B-cell dysfunction with appear-
ance of immature/transitional B-cells and hypergamma-
globulinemia has also been described in active HIV
infection in adults [8,20,34-36]. There are some discre-
pancies in the literature concerning the change in num-
ber of these cells in adult HIV-infected patients [19-24].
However, long-term response to HAART seems to
restore at least partially, the number and function of
these cells [8,10,12,19,20]. In the present study, the
number of CD5+ B lymphocytes was correlated directly
with production of IL-7 and IL-10 by CBMCs. CD5 is a
negative regulator of the B-cell receptor signaling contri-
buting to a prolonged cell survival and maintaining tol-
erance in anergic B cells in vivo [37]. In cord blood,
CD5+ B lymphocytes represent about half of the B cells
[38]. The increase of CD5+ B lymphocytes in our HIV-
exposed newborns may be an expression of an immune
deregulation due to placental transfer of viral proteins
and cytokines. How these changes may affect the neona-
tal development of HIV-exposed uninfected children is
not known, but a reduced response to neonatal vaccines
has been reported [13]. So, the changes found in our
HIV-exposed newborns indicate that, although HAART
controlled maternal HIV infection, leading to low or
undetectable viral load at 35 weeks of pregnancy, chil-
dren still had changes in B lymphocytes, consistent with
some remaining HIV-mediated immune abnormalities.
We studied B-cell maturation in cord blood using
four-color-antibody combinations proposed by van
Lochen et al [39]. Only the combinations that examined
the initial maturation of the B cell line were able to dis-
close differences between normal newborns and those
born to HIV+ mothers. Especially maternal drug abuse
and a longer period of maternal HAART treatment dur-
ing pregnancy were associated with a larger number of
immature B-cells. This could be a sign of a higher fetal
burden of HIV-related proteins and TNFa [33]. Little is
known about the influence of cocaine on the immune
system, although some earlier studies [40] have shown a
smaller stimulation of cord lymphocytes by PHA and
PMA and lower levels of IL-1 and IL-2 in cord blood
from newborns of drug abusing mothers.
Conclusions
We conclude that in our study setting, uninfected
infants born to HIV+ women, several immunological
abnormalities could be detected. They were related to
the residual maternal immune changes caused by the
HIV infection as well as the use of antiretroviral drugs
during pregnancy. Maternal smoking was associated to
changes in cord CD3/CD4 cells, and maternal hard drug
abuse was associated to more pronounced changes in
the cord B cell line. Immunological changes in unin-
fected infants born to HIV+ women may persist for sev-
eral years [2,9-11]. Little is known about their long term
clinical significance. It would be interesting to examine
in detail the evolution of the PB lymphocyte subsets in
our study cohort. The role of maternal smoking and
drug abuse on the development of the immune system
of their offspring should also be studied in larger
cohorts of mother-child pairs.
