Abstract
Background: Agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM) is one of the Philadelphia chromosome
negative myeloproliferative disorder and is diagnosed by hyperplasia of atypical megakaryocytes,
hepatosplenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoiesis and bone marrow fibrosis. Fibrosis is
considered to be a secondary consequence of enhanced levels of fibrogenic growth factors such as
TGF β1, bFGF and PDGF produced by enhanced numbers of megakaryocytes, while the primary
cause is considered to be the enhanced proliferation of a defective stem cell. We have previously
reported that thrombopoietin (TPO) is elevated in patients with AMM. Others have reported that
Mpl protein is decreased in these patients. Since TPO is essential for the development of
megakaryocytes, and Mpl protein is the receptor for TPO, we extended the study of TPO/Mpl to
in vitro and in vivo cell culture systems to better understand the mechanism that leads to reduced
Mpl protein in AMM patients.
Results: Plasma TPO levels were significantly elevated and Mpl protein levels were significantly
reduced in AMM patients in concordance with previous studies. Platelet Mpl transcripts in AMM
were however similar to those in controls. We also cloned Mpl cDNA from AMM patients and
tested for their ability to make functional proteins in vitro and in the in vivo system of 293 T human
embryonic kidney cells. Their expression including the glycosylated forms was similar to those from
the controls. We also measured the level of translation initiation factor, eIF4E and found it to be
increased in patients with AMM demonstrating that the reduced Mpl protein may not be due to
translation defects.
Conclusions: Our studies using the in vitro and in vivo systems further confirm that reduced Mpl
protein levels are not due to defects in its transcription/translation. Reduced Mpl protein could be
due to its increased internalisation owing to enhanced plasma TPO or in vivo intrinsic defects in
patients with AMM.
Background
Agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM), polycythemia
vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) are characterized as myelo-
proliferative disorders (MPDs) arising due to exponential
amplification of a haematopoietic stem cell. A typical fea-
ture of these disorders is the presence of high number of
circulating progenitor cells and their cytokine

independent growth in culture. So far, the molecular basis
for the disorder has been recognized only for CML and is
attributed to the Bcr/Abl or Philadelphia (Ph) chromo-
some arising due to a translocation event. The aetiology
for the other three disorders referred to as Ph negative
MPDs is unknown.
AMM, one of the Ph negative MPD is diagnosed by hyper-
plasia of atypical megakaryocytes, hepatosplenomegaly,
extramedullary haematopoiesis and bone marrow fibro-
sis. Fibrosis is considered to be a secondary consequence
of enhanced levels of fibrogenic growth factors such as
TGF β1, bFGF and PDGF produced by enhanced numbers
of megakaryocytes (MKs), while the primary cause is con-
sidered to be the enhanced proliferation of a defective
stem cell. What leads to generation of such a defective cell
with enhanced proliferation is unknown. We have earlier
demonstrated [1], which has later been confirmed [2] that
thrombopoietin (TPO) is one of the growth factors whose
level is enhanced in patients with AMM. TPO is a haemat-
opoietic growth factor that is essential for megakaryocy-
topoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis [3]. TPO binds to its
receptor Mpl (Myeloproliferative leukaemia), gets inter-
nalised [4], and initiates a STAT5 signalling cascade [5],
which results in thrombopoiesis. Studies with TPO knock-
out mice have shown reduced numbers of platelets and
myeloid progenitor cells confirming the role of TPO.
Enhanced expression of TPO in mouse by Retroviral/Ade-
noviral gene transfers and in mice transgenic for TPO, the
animals developed extramedullary haematopoiesis and
splenomegaly due to MK and granulocytic hyperplasia.
The severity of the conditions was related to the expres-
sion levels of TPO, resulting in myelofibrosis under very
high expression level [6-8]. These results of TPO over
expression are similar to the symptoms of AMM and
hence indicate that high levels of TPO found in AMM
patients could be responsible for the clinical features of
AMM. In the mouse knockouts for Mpl receptor, there is
about 85% reduction in the number of platelets, MKs and
other haematopoietic cell types [9] and Mpl over expres-
sion leads to myeloproliferation [10]. In vitro, Mpl anti-
sense oligonucleotides inhibited megakaryocytopoiesis
[11]. These reports augment the role of Mpl in megakary-
opoiesis. But in contrast to TPO, Mpl protein level is
reduced in AMM patients [12]. This abnormality in the
TPO/Mpl pathway may depict the clinical features, but is
it the cause for MK hyperplasia and the disease? Studies so
far have not been conclusive.
According to Taksin et al. [13] defects in the TPO/Mpl
pathway are unlikely to be primarily responsible for
AMM. Autonomously growing MKs in AMM did not have
enhanced TPO transcripts and they were not inhibited by
TPO antibody. Also no mutations were detected in the
Mpl gene in these patients, to account for its reduced pro-
tein level. The observation of Li et al. [14] that Mpl anti-
sense oligonucleotide treatment could inhibit the autono-
mous growth of MKs from ET/PV/AMM in vitro suggests
that expression of Mpl is essential for MK autonomy in
these disorders. However Moliterno et al. [12,15] have
reported reduced Mpl protein level with glycosylation
defects in the platelets of patients with these disorders.
Although this could be responsible for the impaired TPO-
mediated platelet protein tyrosine phosphorylation seen
in PV and AMM patients [16], it does not confer with MK
autonomy/hypersensitivity for growth in vitro. This
reduced expression of Mpl in a disorder characterized by
MK hyperplasia whose development and differentiation is
dependent on this cytokine is paradoxical and needs fur-
ther investigation.
Hence to better understand the role of TPO/Mpl in AMM,
we have extended the study of this growth factor and its
receptor gene in these patients. Our studies reveal
enhanced plasma TPO level, reduced endogenous level of
Mpl protein in the platelets of patients with AMM and
absence of any co-relation between TPO level and Mpl
expression. We have cloned Mpl cDNA from 15 AMM
patients and have found that it has full potential for
expression similar to controls both in vitro and in the in
vivo heterologous system of 293 T cells. We also assayed
for the level of eIF4E, the translation initiation factor that
under normal limiting level favours translation of strong
mRNAs such as those of house keeping genes and at
higher level, enhances the translation of weak mRNAs
such as Mpl. AMM patients were found to have elevated
eIF4E level.
Results
TPO ELISA
Undiluted platelet poor plasma (PPP) samples from 20
AMM patients and 10 controls were assayed for their TPO
levels. Although some patients exhibited low TPO levels,
overall, TPO level was enhanced in AMM patients as com-
pared to controls [0–684 pg/ml in AMM patients (with a
mean of 229 pg/ml) as compared to 0–71 pg/ml in con-
trols (with a mean of 22.8 pg/ml)]. This increase in TPO
was significant (P < 0.001) as determined by t-test (Fig. 1).
Minimum detectable dose with the TPO ELISA kit is 2.78–
18.5 pg/ml according to the manufacturer. The Optical
Density (OD) values for samples were within the range
obtained with the highest standard (2000 pg/ml) used in
the ELISA. Some samples from controls and patients as
well failed to register any OD probably due to very low
TPO levels.

SDS PAGE. Mpl antibody that was raised against the full
length Mpl protein was used for western blot analysis.
This antibody recognizes both glycosylated and non-glyc-
osylated forms of Mpl. The blots were re-probed with β
Actin antibody for normalization. The western blots on
chemiluminescence detection showed an overall reduc-
tion in the expression of Mpl in the platelets of patients
with AMM and there was no co-relation (r2 = 0.0038)
between TPO level and Mpl levels (Fig. 2). While there
was high expression of glycosylated form of Mpl in the
controls, the expression of Mpl in the platelets of patients
with AMM varied from none to having reduced amounts
of both glycosylated and faster moving non-glycosylated
forms. A representative blot with results from 4 controls
and 7 patients is shown in Fig. 3. The developed blots
were analysed using the Image J program to quantitate the
intensity of the bands and the values for Mpl expression
after normalization against β Actin expression are repre-
sented in Fig. 4. Statistical analysis of the values by t-test
revealed the reduced Mpl expression to be significant (P <
0.05).
Mpl RNA level is similar in controls and AMM patients
Since Mpl protein level was reduced in AMM patients, to
know if it was due to reduced transcription of the Mpl
gene, we compared the levels of Mpl RNA in AMM
patients and controls by Real-Time RT-PCR. Total RNA
from the platelets of 12 controls and 12 AMM patients
were used as templates for PCR with gene specific primers.
The values were normalized against GAPDH expression
and are represented in Fig. 5. On statistical analysis (t-
test), the difference in Mpl expression was found not to be

luted Platelet Poor Plasma samples of 10 controls and 20
AMM patients was tested by ELISA. While TPO level was in
the range of 0–71 pg/ml in controls (Mean 22.8 pg/ml), it
ranged between 0–684 pg/ml in AMM patients (Mean 229 pg/
ml). This elevation of TPO level in patients was significant (P
< 0.001) compared to controls.

ysis. The blots were re-probed with β Actin Antibody for
normalization. This representative autoradiogram shows the
results for 4 controls and 7 AMM patients.

significant (P > 0.05), indicating absence of any transcrip-
tional inhibition of Mpl in AMM patients.
AMM patients have high eIF4E levels
We assayed for the expression of eIF4E in the platelets of
12 AMM patients to see if reduced Mpl protein level could
be due to its reduced translation owing to limiting levels
of eIF4E, a translation initiation factor that could favour
translation of weaker mRNA such as Mpl at higher
amounts. At limiting levels it favours translation of
stronger mRNA over the weaker mRNA. The western blots
on chemiluminescence detection showed an overall
increase in the expression of eIF4E in the platelets of
patients with AMM. A representative blot shown in Fig. 6
includes 5 controls and 12 AMM patients (Platelet sample
from Patient # 7 has inadequate protein). The developed
blots were analysed using the Image J program to quanti-
tate the intensity of the bands and the values for eIF4E
expression after normalization against β Actin expression
are represented in Fig. 7. Statistical analysis of the values
by t-test revealed the elevated eIF4E expression to be sig-
nificant (P < 0.0001) and absence of any significant co-
relation between the expression levels of Mpl and eIF4E
(data not shown).
The coding region of Mpl from AMM patients has no
mutations
Mpl cDNA was amplified from the platelets of 15 AMM
patients along with those from 15 normal controls by RT-
PCR, cloned into the Blue Script vector and the recom-
binant clones sequenced completely. Base changes were
detected in some patients and controls as well in the exons
2,3, 4, 6 and 12 but not at the same nucleotide (data not
shown). The same changes were however not observed on

blots were re-probed with β Actin Antibody for normaliza-
tion. A representative autoradiogram including 5 controls
and all 12 patient samples is shown in this figure. Platelet

re-cloning the cDNA of the samples with mutations and
sequencing the corresponding genomic region. These base
changes were therefore considered to be due to PCR errors
and not genuine mutations. Hence Mpl gene abnormali-
ties were not detected in AMM patients.
Mpl from AMM patients is able to transcribe and translate
in vitro
About 1 µg of the Mpl cDNA of 15 controls and 15 AMM
patients in the pcDNA3 vector were subjected to in vitro
transcription/translation employing the rabbit reticu-
lolysates to see if they were capable of translation in vitro.
Mpl from AMM patients were able to translate as effi-
ciently as the cDNA from controls revealing their full
potential for translation. Also, in the presence of canine
microsomal membranes, the translated protein was glyc-
osylated similar to those from the controls.
Results from 2 controls and 4 AMM patients are repre-
sented in Fig. 8. The developed autoradiographs were ana-
lysed using the Image J program to quantitate the intensity
of the bands and the values are represented in Fig. 9. Sta-
tistical analysis of the values by t-test revealed absence of
any difference (P > 0.05) between cDNA from controls
and AMM either in the amount of the translation product
or its glycosylation.

appeared to be similar between controls and AMM
patients. Fig. 10 is a representative blot depicting results of
5 controls and 5 AMM patients. Two bands were identi-
fied. The developed blots were analysed using the Image J
program to quantitate the intensity of the bands and the
values for Mpl expression are shown in Fig. 11. Statistical
analysis of the values by t-test showed no significant dif-
ference (P > 0.05) in the level of Mpl expression.
Discussion
AMM is one of the MPDs for which the molecular defect
is unknown. A characteristic feature of the disorder is the
presence of atypical megakaryocytes in high numbers and
their autonomy or hypersensitivity to growth factors in
vitro. Since the haematopoietic growth factor TPO that is
essential for the development of megakaryocytes is
present at high level in AMM patients, it is of interest to
study the role of TPO and its receptor in AMM.
We have earlier reported that AMM patients have elevated
plasma TPO level and this is not associated with its
enhanced transcription in the bone marrow cells [1,17].
To determine if this enhanced TPO level is due to its recep-
tor abnormalities, we have analysed 12 AMM patients for
the presence of Mpl protein in their platelets and found it
to be reduced in AMM relative to controls. However, this
reduced level was not due to its reduced transcription
since Real-Time RT-PCR revealed similar levels of tran-
scripts from AMM patients and controls. To analyse if it
could be due to its reduced translation owing to its G-C
rich 5' UTR, we estimated the expression of the translation
initiation factor eIF4E. The promoter of Mpl displays
characteristics of weak mRNA that are not translated very
efficiently due to G-C rich 5' UTR [18]. The translation ini-
tiation factor eIF4E, that is present at low level under nor-
mal conditions favours the translation of strong mRNA at
these limiting levels. At higher levels, although the trans-
lation of strong mRNA is not increased greatly, the trans-
lation of weak mRNAs is highly enhanced and this is
usually associated with hyper proliferation of cells as in
cancers [19]. Hence we assayed for the expression of eIF4E
in AMM to see if reduced Mpl protein level could be due
to its reduced translation owing to limiting eIF4E level
compared to controls. However eIF4E level was rather sig-
nificantly higher than in controls as seen in other diseases
with hyper cellular proliferation. Although this is not
direct evidence, at these levels of eIF4E, normal transla-
tion of Mpl can be expected.
Since there was no significant difference in the Mpl RNA
level of AMM patients as shown by RT-PCR, we cloned
and sequenced Mpl gene from these patients to over-rule
any structural defects that could prevent translation.
Although base changes were observed for some patients
and controls as well, on sequencing the corresponding
regions of the genomic DNA, the same base changes were
not observed. Hence these were not considered to be gen-
uine mutations. Taksin et al. [13] also have reported
absence of Mpl gene mutations in AMM patients. Hence to

fected with pcDNA3/Mpl constructs from 15 AMM patients
and 15 controls. Transfection lysates were analysed by 6%
SDS PAGE. Blots were probed with Mpl antibody raised
against the full length Protein. A representative blot with data
for 5 controls and 5 patients is shown in this figure. The sec-
ond band probably corresponds to non-glycosylated Mpl.

date, there are no reports describing Mpl gene mutations
in AMM patients although an activating mutation in this
gene has been reported by Ding J et al. [20] in a case of
familial ET, a rare hereditary MPD. Moliterno et al. [21]
have recently reported a single base change polymor-
phism in the Mpl gene of African American patients with
MPD that leads to substitution of the 39th amino acid
Lysine, with Asparagine in the extra cellular domain of the
protein. Patients with this polymorphism exhibited high
platelet counts and low platelet Mpl protein. African
Americans were however not represented amongst our
patients tested. We also performed in vitro transcription/
translation with the cloned cDNA from the AMM patients.
Similar levels of proteins were formed irrespective of the
source of the cDNA, indicating that the cDNA from AMM
patients had no structural defects preventing its
translation. There was no difference in the extent of glyc-
osylation of the protein either when the reaction was per-
formed in the presence of microsomal membranes
capable of post-translational modification in vitro. To
further confirm this in vivo, these cDNAs were transfected
into 293 T human embryonic kidney cells and the cell
lysates analysed by western blots for Mpl expression. Irre-
spective of the source of the cDNA, similar level of expres-
sion of Mpl protein was observed. Two bands were
however detected. Since the antibody used can react with
both glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of Mpl, it is
likely that the second band corresponds to non-glyco-
sylated form. As the in vivo system is saturated with the
over-expressed protein, the system for modification of the
protein could be exhausted. Overall, Mpl gene from AMM
patients does not seem to have any impaired structural
features to prevent its transcription/translation.
Our present study shows elevated TPO level; reduced Mpl
platelet protein level; absence of Mpl transcriptional inhi-
bition and absence of any structural defects in Mpl coding
region in AMM patients. However, there was no co-rela-
tion between TPO level and Mpl expression, similar to the
observation of Harrison CN et al. [22] in ET patients.
Plasma TPO level is regulated by platelet counts and MK
mass [23]. TPO binds to its receptor Mpl on platelets/MKs
and gets internalised. This receptor mediated endocytosis
of TPO leads to its catabolism by the lysozymes, without
any recycling of the receptors to the surface [24]. In AMM
patients there is initial MK hyperplasia and thrombocyto-
sis that leads to enhanced release of growth factors such as
Platelet Derived Growth Factor, bFibroblast Growth Fac-
tor and Transforming Growth Factor β1 [25-27]. This may
lead to increase in TPO transcription, since these growth
factors have been shown to stimulate the transcription of
TPO from the bone marrow stromal cells in cultures
[28,29]. Our earlier observation that elevated plasma TPO
level is not associated with its enhanced transcription in
the bone marrow cells [17] could be due to the fact that
our cultures predominantly consisted of fibroblasts and
not stromal cells.
Enhanced expression of TPO and absence of an accompa-
nying increase in Mpl transcription or re-cycling of the
internalised receptor may be responsible for persistence of
high plasma TPO level in AMM patients. Reduced Mpl
level seen in AMM patients may be due to exhaustion of
the Mpl pool by binding to the enhanced TPO and its
subsequent catabolism. This gains support from an earlier
observation in thrombocythemic mice wherein very high
and persistent level of TPO due to its induced over expres-
sion were found to be associated with reduced platelet
Mpl protein without any reduction in Mpl transcription
[30]. Also in other MPDs such as ET/PV, high plasma TPO
level is associated with low Mpl protein level [16,31]. In
vivo Mpl post-translational defect may also be responsible
for impaired Mpl protein forms and levels in these
patients as suggested by Moliterno et al. [15]. Cloning and
sequencing of TPO 5' UTR from these patients may
provide additional valuable information on elevated TPO
levels since mutations in 5' UTR of TPO have been associ-
ated with elevated TPO levels without any increase in its
transcription in patients with thrombocytosis [32,33].
Conclusions
Our studies with TPO/Mpl show elevated TPO and
reduced Mpl level in AMM patients, without any
significant co-relation in their expression levels. Mpl
cDNAs from AMM patients had full potential for tran-
scription/translation including glycosylation, in vitro and
in vivo, similar to those of normal controls. Reduced Mpl
protein level may not be due to defects in its transcription/
translation but could be due to increased internalisation
or intrinsic defects in translation and glycosylation.
Methods
Patients
Peripheral blood was obtained from patients with AMM
after informed consent and peripheral blood was
obtained from normal volunteers to serve as controls. Five
volumes of peripheral blood was mixed with 1 volume of
ACD buffer pH 4.5–5.5 (2.2% W/V Sodium Citrate; 0.8%
Citric Acid; 2.2% Glucose; 50 ng/ml PGE-1) and
centrifuged at 250 g for 10 minutes. The cell pellet was
diluted 5X with Hank's buffer and subjected to Ficoll/
Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. The ring of
mononuclear cells was washed 2X with Hank's buffer and
processed for isolation of genomic DNA using the Wizard
Genomic DNA Purification kit from Promega, Madison,
WI, following their instructions. The Platelet Rich Plasma
(PRP) supernatant was centrifuged at 800 g for 10' to
obtain the platelets. The Platelet Poor Plasma (PPP) was
stored at -80°C, and the platelet pellet washed 2X with the

Citrate buffer, pH 6.2 (0.05 mmol/L Sodium Citrate; 0.1
mol/L NaCl; 0.14 mol/L Glucose). They were then proc-
essed for RNA isolation using the Totally RNA isolation kit
from Ambion, Texas, following their instructions or were
suspended in 1X PBS and lysed with equal amount of 2X
Laemelli buffer (0.125 M Tris HCl pH 6.8; 4% SDS; 0.56
M β Mercaptoethanol; 0.02% Bromophenol Blue; 20%
Glycerol) for western blot analysis.
TPO ELISA
TPO level in the blood plasma was estimated using the
Human thrombopoietin Quantikine ELISA kit from R & D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN. The assay is based on the two-
sided sandwich principle. Standards and undiluted PPP
samples from 10 normal controls and 20 AMM patients
were incubated in micro-titer Plates whose wells are pre-
coated with monoclonal TPO antibody. After washing off
the unbound substances, the wells were incubated with
polyclonal TPO antibody conjugated with HRP enzyme.
After subsequent washes to remove any unbound anti-
body-enzyme, a substrate solution for HRP was added to
the wells. The color developed that is proportional to the
amount of TPO from plasma bound to the plate was
quantitated using the Opsys MR plate reader.
Real-Time RT-PCR
Real-Time RT-PCR was performed to determine the
expression of Mpl in platelets of 12 controls and 12 AMM
patients, using the Geneamp 5700 SDS Instrument from
Applied Bio-systems, Foster City, CA. Reagent for the
assay was the Quantitect RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA). Mpl mRNA in the platelets was reverse transcribed
and PCR amplified from 10 ng of total RNA with gene spe-
cific primers and a florescent reporter probe that hybrid-
ises to the gene in between the two primers. The sequences
of the primers were:
MPL FP 5'-AAGTCCTCAGAGAGGACTCCTTTG-3
MPL RP 5'-CAGGCAAGAAGGCTGCAATC-3'
MPL PROBE 5'-FAM CCTCCCAGGCCCAGATGGACTAC-
3' BHQ1
The reaction conditions were reverse transcription at
50°C for 30'; 40 cycles of amplification with de-natura-
tion at 94°C for 15", annealing and extension at 60°C for
10".
Sequence Analysis of Mpl
Total RNA extracted from platelets obtained from 15
patients with AMM and 15 normal controls was used to
clone the full length Mpl cDNA. First strand cDNA was
synthesized using the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis
System for RT-PCR from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
following their specifications. About 3 µg of total RNA
was mixed with 50 ng of random hexamers, and 1 mM
dNTPs in 10 µl reaction volume and incubated at 65°C
for 5' and left on ice for 1'. A cocktail mix of RT buffer,
MgCl2 and DTT was added to a final concentration of 1X,
5 mM and 10 mM respectively along with 40 Units of
RNase OUT Ribonuclease Inhibitor and incubated at
25°C for 2'. 50 Units of SuperScript II Reverse Tran-
scriptase enzyme was added and incubated at 25°C for 10'
and 42°C for 50'. The reaction was terminated by heating
at 70°C for 15' and chilled on ice. 2 Units of RNase H was
added and incubated at 37°C for 20' to remove the RNA
from cDNA: RNA hybrids to increase the sensitivity of
PCR from cDNA. Mpl was amplified using the Expand
High Fidelity PCR kit from Roche, Indianapolis, IN, with
gene specific primers containing EcoR 1 (FP) and Xho 1
(RP) Restriction Enzyme sites to enable directional
cloning. The Restriction Enzyme sites are indicated in
lower case in the Primer sequences given below.
FP 5'-CGgaattcGAAGGGAGGATGGGCTAAGGC-3'
RP 5'-CCGctcgagAGTTTAGCTCTGTCCAGGGAA-3'
The Products were purified using the Wizard PCR Preps
DNA Purification System from Promega, Madison, WI,
and digested with the Restriction Enzymes, EcoR 1 and
Xho 1. The digested products were then cloned into Blue
Script vector. The recombinants were checked by
restriction analysis and the selected positive clones were
sequenced completely at Northwoods DNA Inc., Becida,
MN. Mpl cDNA were re-cloned from samples that had
mutations and sequenced completely. The putative muta-
tions were confirmed by sequencing the corresponding
region of the Mpl gene from respective samples. For this,
the genomic DNA isolated from the peripheral blood
samples were PCR amplified with gene specific primers
and the PCR products were directly sequenced after puri-
fication using the Wizard PCR Preps DNA Purification
System from Promega, Madison, WI.
In vitro transcription/translation of Mpl
The Mpl cDNA clones in the Blue Script vector were
digested with EcoR 1 and Xho 1 and the released Mpl cDNA
was cloned into pcDNA 3 vector to obtain cDNA with 3'
translational signals. These constructs were then subjected
to in vitro transcription/translation using the TNT Quick
Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems from
Promega. Madison, WI, in the presence of 35S Methionine
from Amersham Biosciences. About 0.5 µg of the con-
structs were incubated with the TNT Quick-Coupled Mas-
ter Mix and 35S Methionine in the absence or presence of
2 µl of Canine microsomal membranes provided with the
TNT Quick Coupled kit, at 30°C for 2 hours. The reactions
were terminated by adding 100 µl of 1X SDS loading

buffer (50 mM Tris. HCl pH 6.8; 100 mM DTT; 2% SDS;
0.1% Bromophenol Blue; 10% Glycerol) and stored at -
20°C. Appropriately translated and processed products
were then separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The gel
was dried using Model 583 Gel dryer from BIO-RAD, Her-
cules, CA. The products of translation were visualized by
autoradiography of the dried gel. The bands were quanti-
tated using the Image J program.
Transfections
293 T human embryonic kidney cells were used for the
transient transfection studies with pcDNA3/Mpl con-
structs of controls and patients used in the in vitro tran-
scription/translation studies. The cells were seeded onto a
6 well plate at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well a day before
transfection with DMEM medium containing 10% FBS.
On the day of the transfection, the cells were washed with
DMEM medium without serum and covered with 800 µl
of the same. In an eppendorf tube, 1 µg of the DNA was
mixed with 100 µl of serum free DMEM medium and 100
µl of DMEM containing 2 µl of Lipofectamine transfection
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added to this
DNA. The mixture was incubated for 30' at room temper-
ature and then added to the 800 µl of medium covering
the cells. After incubating for 5 hours at 37°C the transfec-
tion medium was removed and replaced with DMEM
medium with 10% FBS. The cells were harvested 48 hours
post-transfection. They were washed twice with 1X PBS
and the cells dislodged by gentle re-suspension. The cells
were collected and centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 10'. The
cell pellets were re-suspended in 100 µl of 1 X PBS each
and lysed with 100 µl of 2X Laemelli buffer.
Western Blot Analysis
The Transfection cell lysates/platelet cell lysates in 1X
Laemelli buffer were boiled for 5', clarified by centrifuga-
tion at 14 000 RPM for 5', loaded onto a 6% SDS PAGE,
and transferred onto immobilon nylon membrane. The
membrane after transfer was rinsed with 1X PBS and incu-
bated in the blocking solution (5% milk in 1 X PBS; 0.1 %
Tween 20) for 1 hr., at room temperature. The membrane
was then incubated with 1:10 000 dilutions of Rabbit anti
Mpl antibody from Upstate USA Inc. VA, over night at
4°C in the blocking solution. The membrane was then
washed 4 X with 1X PBST (1X PBS; 0.1% Tween 20) for 15'
each and incubated with 1:5000 dilutions of HRP
conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 1 hr., at
room temperature. Washes with 1X PBST were repeated
and the membrane processed for detection using the
Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Kit from
Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA, following their
recommendations. The bands were quantitated using the
Image J program. Similar procedure was followed for the
detection of eIF4E protein in the platelets except that a
10% SDS PAGE was used for separation of the proteins.
The eIF4E antibody from Transduction Laboratories, CA,
was used at 1:1000 dilutions.
