Abstract
Osteonecrosis (ON) is a debilitating long-term complication of allogenic bone marrow
transplantation (alloBMT) but may begin before alloBMT in some children because of their
primary disease treatment. Therefore, to estimate the prevalence and associated risk factors for ON
before alloBMT, we conducted a retrospective analysis of magnetic resonance (MR) studies of
118 children who underwent first alloBMT at our institution between December 2000 and
September 2007. Of the 118 consecutive patients, 107 (90.7%) underwent prospective MR studies
irrespective of symptoms (69 males; median age at alloBMT 12.9 years), and 11 underwent MR
studies for symptoms. Amongst the 107 who had prospective imaging, 23 (21.5%) had ON; nearly
50% had at least 30% epiphyseal involvement. Knees were more frequently involved than were
hips; severity of ON was greater in hips. ON prevalence before alloBMT was 23.72% when all
118 patients were included in the denominator. Risk factor analysis, limited to MR studies
performed irrespective of symptoms, revealed female gender (P = 0.049) and age ≥10 years at the
time of MR study (P = 0.03) as significant risk factors and primary diagnosis of lymphoid
malignancies and aplastic anemia trended towards significance. ON prior to alloBMT is a
common occurrence in children.

Introduction
Osteonecrosis (ON) is a potentially persistent and debilitating complication after allogenic
bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) 1-6.Incidences in pediatric populations range from
3.9% to 44.2%7-9. These lesions can progress and eventually lead to collapse of affected
joints, 10-12 making joint replacement necessary while the individual is still a teenager or
young adult. Joint replacement in teenagers and young adults is undesirable because these
patients will typically require additional revisions and replacements as they age. 3,12,13
The prevalence of ON and its probable risk factors, such as acute or chronic graft versus
host disease (GvHD) requiring steroids, increasing age, and a primary diagnosis of aplastic
anemia or acute leukemia, have been documented in post-BMT settings in mixed
populations 1,5,6.However, the prevalence and risk factors for developing ON before BMT
remain undefined. Children who undergo BMT have primary diseases that are often
associated with the occurrence of ON either as a direct result of disease pathology (e.g., in
sickle-cell disease) 14,15 or secondary to the high-dose chemotherapy or steroids used for
treatment (e.g., leukemias)16-18. Because these children are exposed to bone toxic factors
even before undergoing BMT, it is possible that ON may develop before BMT in some
cases.
Identifying the subset of children who will develop pretransplantation ON or who may be at
risk of posttransplantation ON progression will help in early recognition of this debilitating
condition, which may allow intervention in stages preceding collapse when joint-preserving
procedures are possible 19. It will also allow suitable tailoring of medical management post–
BMT and provide timely counseling of parents and patients. Early recognition will also help
assess the true affect of BMT on the evolution of ON and allow development of
interventions to ameliorate ON progression and maintain joint function. We therefore
conducted a retrospective analysis of magnetic resonance (MR) images and medical records
of 118 children who underwent first alloBMT at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital
between December 2000 and September 2007 to estimate the prevalence of ON and to
identify risk factors for its development before alloBMT in this population.
Methods
Study population
We conducted a retrospective review of medical records and MR images of children who
underwent first alloBMT for malignant or nonmalignant conditions at St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital between December 2000 and September 2007. Only patients for whom
MR imaging results of hips, knees, or both before the first alloBMT were available were
included in the reported cohort. This cohort was further divided into two groups: MR studies
performed irrespective of symptoms (Group1) and MR studies performed for symptoms
only (Group2). Since January 2002, patients undergoing evaluation for alloBMT at St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital undergo a baseline protocol-driven MR of hips and knees
before alloBMT. Also included in group 1 were patients who had undergone MRs of hips,
knees, or both as a part of their primary disease follow-up assessment irrespective of
symptoms. Typically patients with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) undergo MR studies
after every reinduction therapy. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergo
prospective MR studies of the femur to assess marrow response to therapy, and patients with
sickle-cell disease undergo MR studies because of the recognized increased risk of ON in
these patients14,20. To avoid bias, risk factor analysis was restricted to Group 1 patients
only. Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study, and data was managed
according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

Osteonecrosis
The presence of ON was determined by using MR imaging. As a standard of care at our
institution, patients being evaluated for ON undergo coronal noncontrast T1-weighted and
short tau inversion recovery (STIR) imaging of the hips and/or knees and sagittal FLASH 2-
D imaging of the articular surfaces. Imaging studies were performed with either a Siemens
1.5 T Symphony or a Vision MR Unit (Siemens, Inc., Erlangen, Germany). Images were
reviewed and interpreted by an experienced pediatric radiologist (SCK). As described
previously, ON is defined as a geographic area of decreased signal on T1-weighted and
increased signal on STIR 12,21 .ON locations were classified as epiphyseal, metaphyseal, or
diaphyseal. Because the extent of epiphyseal involvement is an important predictor of joint
outcome, the extent of epiphyseal involvement was categorized as ≥30% or <30% of the
weight-bearing volume 12. Thus, hip joint involvement was coded according to the
involvement of the capital femoral epiphysis, and knee joints were coded as involved if an
ON lesion was present in either the distal femoral or the proximal tibial epiphysis. For
patients who underwent multiple MR studies before transplantation, the examination
demonstrating the most severe ON was the one used for analysis. The distribution of joint
involvement is important for designing interventions to ameliorate ON. Therefore, the
pattern of joint involvement was also studied.
Risk Factors
Risk factor analysis was done only for the patients who had MR studies irrespective of
symptoms (i.e., Group1). The following risk factors were studied to determine their
associations with ON: gender, race, age at MR imaging (i.e., <10 years or ≥10 years), age at
primary diagnosis, primary diagnosis, and body mass index (BMI) at the time of the MR
study. BMI at the time of MR study was calculated only for patients older than 2 years, per
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria (www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/
assessing/bmi/childrens_bmi/about_childrens_bmi.html)22. Participants were categorized as
healthy, underweight, overweight, or obese per CDC criteria22.
Malignant conditions were categorized as lymphoid [i.e., ALL, non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(NHL), and Hodgkin disease] or non-lymphoid malignancies [i.e., acute myeloid leukemia/
myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), sarcoma, and
neuroblastoma]. Also, because statistical power for eliciting the effect of individual
treatment regimens was limited and individual cumulative doses of steroids received by each
patient were not available, we categorized primary diagnoses on the basis of known
contemporary treatment protocols to assess the potential effect of steroids. Diagnoses were
grouped as follows: lymphoid malignancies and aplastic anemia or other conditions (i.e.,
AML/MDS, CML, sarcoma, sickle-cell disease, Duncan syndrome, hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis, and hyper–Ig M syndrome).
Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study population by gender, race, age at MR
study, age at alloBMT, BMI at MR study, and primary diagnosis. To assess the internal
validity of our cohort, t-tests and Chi-squared statistics were used to compare the
characteristics of Group1 participants to those of all other alloBMT recipients treated during
the same time.
ON prevalence rates were calculated for epiphyseal involvement of any of the four lower
extremity joints as well as for hips and knees separately. The pattern of joint involvement
was also examined by evaluating the number of lower extremity joints involved at the time
point when the MR study showed the highest grade of ON.

Logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between potential risk
factors and the development of ON in any of the four joints. Risk factors that were
statistically significant in univariate analysis and those which were clinically significant
were further examined in multiple-regression models. Data were analyzed by using SAS
(Version 9.13; SAS Institute, Inc; Cary, NC). Statistical significance was set at an α-error
level of 0.05.
Results
Demographic Characteristics of the Study Population
Of the 344 consecutive patients who underwent first alloBMT at St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital from December 2000 to September 2007, 226 were excluded from further
analysis because they did not have a pre-alloBMT MR study (Figure 1).One hundred
eighteen patients had pre-alloBMT MR studies. Among these patients, 107 (90.7%) had MR
studies irrespective of symptoms (Group1), and 11(10.3%) patients had MR studies because
of symptoms (Group2) (Figure1). All patients underwent treatment for their primary disease
per institutional or cooperative group protocols. Demographic characteristics of Group1 are
shown in Table 1, and demographic and clinical characteristics of Group 2 are in Table 2.
The time from peak ON to alloBMT for the two groups is in Table 3.
The median age of Group1 at the time of MR study was 12.9 years (range 0.5-21.1), and the
median time from diagnosis to alloBMT was 20.2 months (range 2.4-205.9) (Table 1).
Eighty nine patients (83.2%) had malignant diseases and 18 (16.8%) had nonmalignant
diseases (Table 4, 5). Among the 107 patients examined prospectively, 76 (71.03%) had
one, 9 (8.41%) had two, 9 (8.41%) had three, and 13 (12.15%) had more than three MR
studies. Hip MR studies were available for 103 patients (96.26%), and knee MR studies
were available for 84 patients (78.50%). Additionally, the distributions of gender, diagnoses,
and BMI did not differ between Group 1and the remaining population, although the
distribution of age at transplant and race did differ between these groups (Table 4).
Prevalence, severity, and extent of osteonecrosis
When all four joints were considered, prevalence of ON for Groups1 and 2 collectively was
28 of 118 (23.72 %).In those patients who had MR studies irrespective of symptoms,
prevalence was 23 of 107 (21.5%) when all four joints were considered; 16 of 84 (23.5%)
had knee involvement, and 12 of 103 (11.7%) had hip involvement (Table 6). Eight (66.7%)
of 12 patients with hip ON had ≥30% of epiphyseal involvement, whereas only 3 (18.8%) of
16 patients with knee ON had ≥30% of epiphyseal involvement (Table 6).
Pattern of Joint Involvement—The pattern of joint involvement, in patients with ON in
Group 1, is shown in Table 7. Of the 23 patients with ON, 12 (52.2%) had more than one
joint involved (Table 7). The most frequent pattern of multiple joint involvement was that of
bilateral knees.
Risk Factors
Age ≥10 years at MR imaging and female gender were associated with greater odds of
developing ON (OR 4.50; 95%CI 1.16-17.17 and OR 2.70; 95%CI 1.00-7.27, respectively)
(Table 8). There was also a trend towards significance for primary diagnosis of lymphoid
malignancies or aplastic anemia (OR 2.72; CI, 0.99-7.48) after adjusting for age and gender.
Other risk factors studied were not associated with an increased risk of developing ON
(Table 8).

Discussion
One striking observation in our cohort is that approximately half the patients had at least
30% epiphyseal involvement, indicating the existence of significant joint morbidity before
alloBMT. Although regression of small lesions has been reported 11,23, large lesions have
consistently been associated with high rates of progression and joint collapse. For example,
Karimova et al. found that lesions occupying 30% or more of the femoral head volume were
associated with an increased risk of joint collapse or a need for arthroplasty in 48% of
patients 12.
In our study, adolescent females emerged as a conspicuous risk group for developing ON.
Studies in ALL and post alloBMT patients have identified treatment with intensive
chemotherapy and age of 10 or more years as the major risk factors for the development of
ON in children1,2,6,9,16,18. However, whether or not an association between gender and
development of ON exists is unclear 1,5,16,18. Theoretically, an increased risk of ON in
females may be related to earlier onset of puberty with earlier physeal closure 24,25. Mature
bone may be more vulnerable to rises in intraosseous pressure than immature bone,26
leading to ischemia and ON. Because we did not assess pubertal stage, bone age, or sex
hormone levels, we could not analyze the potential association between puberty and ON.
Also, as suggested by Schulte et al.,5 sexual dimorphism in the morphogenesis potential of
osteoblasts may need further exploration to clarify whether or not there exists an association
between gender and the development of ON.
Our data indicate a potential association between primary diagnoses of lymphoid
malignancies or aplastic anemia and the development of ON. These data are supported by
earlier studies that indicate acute leukemias and aplastic anemia as risk factors for post-BMT
ON 1. ON has recently been reported as a morbid skeletal complication among children
being treated for ALL with incidences up to 38% 16,17. Park et al. reported ON in five
children with aplastic anemia prior to any therapy27.
Although cumulative steroid dose information was not available for the children in our
cohort, our trend toward significance among those with lymphoid malignancies or aplastic
anemia indicates that steroids are a potential risk factor for ON. Previous literature indicates
that ON among children with ALL is associated with higher doses of steroids and other
chemotherapeutic agents16-18,28,29. Similarly, ON in patients with aplastic anemia is
associated with antilymphocyte globulin followed by high-dose methylprednisolone 30.
However, because information was not available on the cumulative doses of steroids in our
cohort, we could not distinguish the effect of disease pathophysiology, if any, from
treatment dose–related effects for these children. ON observed in our patients with other
diagnoses such as sickle cell ds, CML, AML, sarcomas is well supported in literature 31-37
Reported risk factors for ON include steroids, vaso-oclusive episodes, chemotherapeutic
agents such as methotrexate, asparaginase, and cyclophosphamide, and disease-related
disturbances in coagulation mechanisms. A direct comparison between prevalence rates in
this study and those of previous studies is difficult because of the smaller number of patients
in individual groups and the diverse diagnostic criteria used. Furthermore, we found no
significant relationship between ON and race or BMI, in contrast to reports indicating that
white patients with ALL have a higher risk than do patients of other races18,38
Consistent with previous reports 1,2,16,17,27,39 , we found multi-articular involvement in our
cohort. However, whereas previous studies using symptom-driven imaging to document ON
indicated an increased frequency of hip involvement1,4,6,28,29, our study, using prospective
imaging, indicated knee involvement to be more frequent than hip involvement 7,16. One

possible reason for knee involvement to be under-diagnosed in symptomatic patients is that
knee pain may be interpreted as referred pain from concurrent ipsilateral hip involvement.
The results of our study should not be interpreted without taking into account their potential
limitations. First, this cohort was older than the overall pre-alloBMT population at St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital. Therefore, the prevalence calculated for our patients could be
an overestimation, since older age has been consistently related to a higher incidence of ON.
Second, we could not determine the effect of individual treatment regimens and disease
pathophysiology on the development of ON. Therefore, because of the diversity of therapy
for various diagnoses, we cannot generalize our findings to children undergoing alloBMT at
other centers. Despite these limitations, our study provides insight into a skeletal toxicity
that may develop before alloBMT and could possibly exacerbate during the transplantation
period when the patient is subjected to additional bone-toxic therapy.
On the basis of this single-institution retrospective study of prospectively acquired MR
studies in a modestly large pediatric population, we conclude that ON before alloBMT is a
common occurrence in children. A high index of suspicion, and, if possible, prospective
screening before alloBMT of adolescent females with lymphoid malignancies or aplastic
anemia may help identify this debilitating disease at pre-collapse stages when joint
preserving interventions are feasible in this young population. This complication also needs
to be considered while developing preparatory and follow-up monitoring protocols for these
patients and while counseling parents and children. Future studies are required to elucidate
the physiologic basis of the effect of gender on the evolution of ON as well as to develop
appropriate interventions to prevent or ameliorate ON.
