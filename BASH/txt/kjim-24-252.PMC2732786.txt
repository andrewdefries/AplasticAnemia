Background/Aims: The bone marrow functions not only as the primary B-lymphocyte-producing organ but also
as a secondary lymphoid organ for CD4 and CD8 cell responses and a site of preferential homing and
persistence for memory T cells. Bone marrow T (BM-T) cells are distinguished from peripheral blood T cells by
surface phenotype, cytokine secretion profile, and immune functions. In this study, we evaluated the alloreactive
potential of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) using BM-T cells in mixed chimerism compared to that using spleen
T (SP-T) cells.
Methods: Cells were prepared using established procedures. BM-T cells were obtained as a by-product of T-cell
depletion in BM grafting and then cryopreserved for subsequent DLI. We performed DLI using BM-T cells in
allogeneic mixed chimera mice on post-BMT day 21.
Results: When the same dose of T cells, 5-10×105
(Thy1.2+), fractionated from BM and spleen were
administered into mixed chimeras, the BM-T group showed complete chimeric conversion, with self-limited graft-
versus-host disease (GVHD) and no pathological changes. However, the SP-T group showed persistent mixed
chimerism, with pathological signs of GVHD in the liver and intestine.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that DLI using BM-T cells, even in small numbers, is more potent at inducing
chimeric conversion in mixed chimerism than DLI using SP-T cells. Further study is needed to determine whether
cryopreserved BM-T cells are an effective cell source for DLI to consolidate donor-dominant chimerism in clinical
practice without concerns about GVHD. (Korean J Intern Med 2009;24:252-262)

INTRODUCTION
Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) is a
curative treatment for various hematological malignancies.
The primary curative potential may be attributable to
alloreactive donor T cells in the graft that mediate a graft-
versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, rather than to the elimination
of all malignant cells by myeloablative conditioning [1,2].
When some patients inevitably relapse despite aggressive
treatment, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) following
ABMT can be an effective alternative for inducing a second
remission [3,4]. However, this beneficial effect of the DLI-
Park HS, et al. Bone marrow T cells as a source for DLI 253
mediated GVL effect, which originates from alloreactive
donor T cells, is often counterbalanced by DLI-mediated
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [5].
Recently, bone marrow T (BM-T) cells have attracted
renewed interest because they have different surface
phenotypes, subsets, and activation states than their
peripheral counterparts [6]. Memory T cells undergo
extensive migration from the blood to the BM and vice
versa [7]. The BM plays an important role in preferential
homing and extensive proliferation of memory T cells
and contributes considerably to the long-lived memory
T-cell pool [8-10]. Not only are BM-T cells more activated
than their splenic counterparts, but they have a higher
rate of local proliferation [11]. Although BM-T (NK1.1-
CD4+ or CD8+) cells do not induce lethal GVHD, even in
high numbers, they mediate vigorous graft-versus-tumor
activity and facilitate engraftment of hematopoietic
progenitor cells [6,12]. These studies suggest that BM-T
cells rather than peripheral T cells are a useful cellular
source for adoptive immunotherapy following ABMT.
Non-myeloablative bone marrow transplantation
(NMT) and allogeneic mixed chimerism can provide an
adequate environment for diminishing susceptibility to
DLI-mediated GVHD and an immunological platform for
DLI in mouse and human models [13,14]. In patients
treated with DLI, a successful GVL effect is often associated
with conversion to complete donor chimerism, which
supports the concept of a graft-versus-host response as
part of the GVL effect [15,16]. Thus, a quiet chimeric
conversion following DLI is desirable for reaching an
optimal DLI-mediated GVL effect without the occurrence
of GVHD. In a mouse model, the administration of non-
tolerant donor spleen cells to established mixed chimeras
converted mixed hematopoietic chimerism to full donor
chimerism without the concomitant development of
GVHD; however, DLI in humans frequently results in
serious GVHD and life-threatening complications [17]. Yet
the use of BM-T cells as the DLI source has received less
attention than the use of spleen T (SP-T) cells in allogeneic
mixed chimerism prepared with NMT.
In this study, we evaluated the beneficial alloreactivity
of DLI using cryopreserved BM-T cells to effectively induce
chimeric conversion without the occurrence of GVHD in
major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched
NMT. The BM-T cells were a by-product of the T-cell
depletion (TCD) procedure in BM grafting.
METHODS
Mice
Female BALB/c (H-2kd
) and C57BL/6 (B6; H-2kb
) mice,
8-10 weeks old, were purchased from Samtago (Kwangju,
Korea). The mice were maintained under specific pathogen-
free conditions in an animal facility with controlled
humidity (55±5%), light (12/12 hours light/dark), and
temperature (22±1˚C). The air in the facility was passed
through a HEPA filter system that was designed to
exclude bacteria and viruses. Animals were fed mouse
chow and tap water ad libitum. The protocols used in
this study were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of The Catholic University of Korea.
Preparation of mixed chimera
Allogeneic mixed chimeras were prepared using
established procedures [18,19]. Briefly, 1 day before BMT,
recipient mice (BALB/C, H-2Kd
) were injected intraperi-
toneally with 200 µL PBS that contained 40 µL recon-
stituted anti-asialoganglioside GM1 (anti-ASGM1; Wako
Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). Recipient mice were exposed to
a single dose of 500 cGy X-rays from a Mevatron MXE-2
(Siemens Co., New York, NY, USA) with a focus-to-skin
distance of 100 cm and a rate of 200 cGy/min. Donor BM
cells were collected into Cedarlane cytotoxicity medium
(RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mM HEPES
buffer and 0.3% bovine serum albumin) by flushing the
shafts of the femurs and tibias of C57BL/6 mice.
Resuspended BM cells were depleted of T cells by
incubation with anti-Thy-1.2 micro-beads (Miltenyi
Biotec, Auburn, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Within 6 hours of irradiation, 2×107
T-cell-
depleted BM cells in a final volume of 0.2 mL PBS were
reinfused into recipient mice.
Cell cryopreservation and thawing
We suspended the collected BM-T cells in 1 mL serum-
free cell freezing medium (BAMBANKERTM
; Wako
Chemicals). The cells were placed in cryotubes and stored
in a chamber overnight at -80˚C. The cells were frozen at
-80˚C and subsequently preserved in liquid nitrogen. The
samples were rapidly thawed in a water bath at 37˚C. The
freezing medium was removed by centrifugation.
DLI
Mononuclear cells from spleen and BM of C57BL/6
mice (donors) were incubated with anti-CD4, anti-CD8,
254 The Korean Journal of Internal Medicine Vol. 24, No. 3, September 2009
and anti-Thy1.2 micro-beads (Miltenyi Biotec) at 4˚C for
15 minutes. After washing with MACS buffer (1% BSA, 2
mM EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4), the cells were subjected to
positive selection through magnetic cell sorting separation
columns. On day 21 after BMT, chimeric mice were infused
via the tail vein with donor-type CD4+, CD8+, unfractiona
-ted spleen cells, and cryopreserved BM-T (Thy1.2+) cells.
Flow cytometric analysis
Donor (H-2Kb
) and recipient (H-2Kd
) cells were
distinguished during lymphoid gating by staining
with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-H-2Kb
and phycoerythrin-labeled anti-H-2Kd
antibodies
(Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), respectively. To
analyze the degree of donor chimerism in the peripheral
blood, we performed lineage-specific staining using
antibodies to T-cell marker CD4, CD8, myeloid maker
CD11b, and B-cell marker B220 (all from Pharmingen).
Stained cells were analyzed using CellQuest software
and a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (both from Becton
Dickinson, Mountain View, CA, USA). Percentages of
donor-derived cells were calculated by dividing the
percentage of donor cells by the total net percentage of
donor plus recipient cells that showed positive staining
for lineage-specific markers [18]. SP-T cells and BM-T
cells used in DLI were characterized by staining with
FITC-anti-TCRβ, PE-anti-NK1.1, PerCP-anti-CD4, and
APC-anti-CD8 (all purchased from Pharmingen).
Histopathological analysis of GVHD
Survival after BMT was monitored daily, and the degree
of clinical GVHD was assessed weekly using a scoring
system that summed changes in five clinical parameters:
weight loss, posture, activity, fur texture, and skin integrity
[20]. Mice were killed at days 21 and 42 after DLI for
blinded histopathological analysis of GVHD target organs
(small and large intestine, liver, and stomach). Organs
were harvested, cryo-embedded, and subsequently
sectioned. Tissue sections were fixed in 10% buffered
formalin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for
histological examination.
Mixed lymphocyte reaction
Spleen cells were used as both responders (BM-T cells
and SP-T cells of mixed chimeric or donor mice) and
stimulators (whole spleen cells of mixed chimeras,
irradiated with 2500 cGy) in this assay [18]. Spleen cells
were removed using ACK lysis buffer, washed, and
resuspended in complete culture medium (RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal calf serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5×105
M 2-ME,
20 mM HEPES, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL
streptomycin). Aliquots of 4×105
responder splenocytes
were cultured with 4×105
irradiated (2,000 cGy) stimulator
splenocytes in 96-well, round-bottomed microwell trays
(Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA). Each well, containing
200 µL complete medium at 37˚C in a humidified 5%
CO2 atmosphere, was pulsed with 1 µCi [3
H]TdR (NEN
Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA, USA) after
incubation for 3.5 days and was harvested 6 h later using
an automated harvester (PHD Cell Harvester; Cambridge
Technology, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA). Results are
expressed as the mean±SD cpm of triplicate samples. The
stimulation index was calculated by comparing the anti-
stimulator response with the anti-self response.
Statistical analysis
Comparison of numerical data between the two groups
was performed with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney
test. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 10.0
forWindows(SPSSInc.,Chicago,IL,USA).P<0.05wascon-
sidered significant. Data are presented as the mean±SD.
RESULTS
Induction of allogeneic mixed chimerism in BALB/c
mice treated with T-cell-depleted NMT
Inhibition of natural killer (NK) cell activity abolishes
the rejection of T-cell-depleted BM grafts in a fully
MHC-mismatched NMT setting. In the present study, we
applied the same protocol to the induction of allogeneic
mixed chimerism between host (BALB/c, H-2kd
) and
donor (C57BL/6, H-2kb
) mice. Multicolor flow cytometric
analysis was performed on peripheral lymphocytes to
determine whether T-cell-depleted NMT induced allo-
geneic mixed chimerism in the host. A representative
example of multi-lineage mixed chimerism in the host at
3 weeks after T-cell-depleted NMT is shown in Fig. 1A.
We confirmed successful induction of allogeneic mixed
chimerism through expression of both H-2kb
and H-2kd
in
the host. The mean±SD relative percentages of cells of
donor origin in the peripheral blood were 77.4±10.3% of
total lymphocytes, 20.0±13.3% of CD4+ T cells, 77.4±
12.5% of CD8+ T cells, 80.4±15.1% of CD11b+ cells, and
99.4±0.3% of B220+ B cells (Fig. 1B).

Three weeks post-BMT conversion of mixed to
complete donor chimerism following DLI using
T-cell subsets of CD4+, CD8+, whole spleen cells,
and BM-T (Thy1.2+) cells
In the early post-transplant period, at day 21, we
performed DLI using 2×106
purified CD4+, 1×106
purified
CD8+, and 1×107
unfractionated spleen cells in allogeneic
mixed chimera mice because, in general, more than 1×107
spleen cells have been used as the cell dose and source for
DLI (they contain about 20% of CD4+ and 10% of CD8+ T
cells). Additionally, we performed DLI using 5×105
cryopreserved BM-T (Thy1.2+) cells, because we planned
to perform DLI using BM-T cells obtained and cry-
opreserved during the TCD procedure of BM grafting.
According to our preliminary data, we confirmed the
percentage of T-cell-depleted (Thy1.2-) cells and BM-T
(Thy1.2+) cells; the former included about 95% and the
latter about 5% of the total BM cells. If in BM grafting 2×
107
T-cell-depleted BM cells are used, we would expect
there to be about 1×106
BM-T (Thy1.2+) cells, which
would be reduced by about half, to about 5×105
, by
cryopreservation and thawing. In all experiments, the
purity of isolated BM-T and SP-T cells was >90%.
Expression of lineage-specific markers, such as TCRβ+,
NK1.1, CD4, and CD8, was investigated in BM-T and SP-T
cells (Fig. 2A).
The degree of chimeric conversion was evaluated in
the peripheral blood by multicolor flow cytometry on day
21 after DLI. When unfractionated spleen cells, CD8+
spleen cells, and BM-T (Thy1.2+) cells were used for DLI,
the host converted to full donor chimerism without DLI-
mediated GVHD symptoms. In contrast, mice that received
DLI using CD4+ spleen cells showed not only a persistent
mixed chimeric state but also various serious DLI-
mediated GVHD symptoms, such as hunched posture,
alopecia, weight loss, diarrhea, and epidermal scaling on
the tail (Fig. 2B and 2C).
BM-T (Thy1.2+) cells in DLI are more potent than
SP-T (Thy1.2+) cells at inducing conversion of
mixed to full donor chimerism on day 21
The above results suggested that BM-T cells potently
induced chimeric conversion despite the small dose. Thus,
we next compared the effect of DLI using BM-T and SP-T
cells at the same cell dose in allogeneic mixed chimerism.
DLI with BM-T cells administered on day 21 led to con-
version to full donor chimerism. The degree of chimeric
conversion was evaluated in the peripheral blood by
multicolor flow cytometry. The results showed that mixed
chimeric mice in the group that received DLI using 5×105
BM-T cells showed high-level donor chimerism in the
lymphoid compartment. The percentages of cells of donor

chimera (C57BL/6 → BALB/C) was prepared by total body
irradiation at a dose of 500 cGy following treatment with
anti-ASGM1 on day 1 of T-cell-depleted NMT. The state of
allogeneic mixed chimerism was evaluated at 3 weeks after
BMT in the peripheral blood. Donor (H-2kb
) and recipient
(H-2kd
) cells were distinguished in lymphoid gating by
staining with FITC-anti-H-2kb
and PE-anti-H-2kd
. Lineage-
specific staining was performed with antibodies to T-cell
markers (Percp-anti-CD4, APC-anti-CD8), myeloid marker
(Perp-anti-CD11b), and B-cell marker (APC-anti-B220). Percentages of donor-derived cells were calculated by dividing the percentages
of donor cells by the total net percentage of donor plus recipient cells stained positively for lineage-specific makers; they are expressed
in the upper right corner of each plot. One representative of 12 measured mixed chimeras is shown (B). The percentage of donor-
derived cells stained positive for H-2kd

experiments, and bars show the means±SD.

increased the degree of donor chimerism, but that using
SP-T cells did not. The percentages of cells of donor origin
in mice that received DLI using BM-T cells were 97.8±
1.2% of total lymphocytes, 83.7±1.6% of CD4+ cells, and
97.0±0.0% of CD8+ cells on day 21 (Fig. 3A) and 99.8±
0.1% of total lymphocytes, 99.3±0.6% of CD4+ cells, and
99.3±0.4% of CD8+ cells on day 42. However, the
percentages of cells of donor origin in mice that received
DLI using SP-T cells were 59.7±45.4% of total lym-
phocytes, 32.5±44.7% of CD4+ cells, and 56.9±48.6% of
CD8+ cells on day 21 and 46.3±56.3% of total lympho-
cytes, 30.6±40.0% of CD4+ cells, and 48.8± 62.2% of
CD8+ cells on day 42 (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate
that DLI using BM-T cells was superior to that using SP-T
cells at inducing chimeric conversion following NMT.
Donor BM-T (Thy1.2+) cells facilitate conversion to
full donor chimerism without GVHD, but donor SP-
T (Thy1.2+) cells do not
GVHD in transplant recipients is caused by total body
irradiation-conditioning procedures and donor T-cell
attack on recipient epithelial tissues such as the gut, liver,
and skin. Many patients die because of GVHD. Thus,
assessment of clinical GVHD is important after BMT. We
measured the body weight of BMT recipients three times
every week. The body weight in DLI recipients (BM-T and
SP-T cell groups) was almost unchanged. The body weight
of mice that received DLI using BM-T cells decreased
slightly but soon recovered. We believe that loss of body
weight is a passing phenomenon in engraftment of the
BM graft (Fig. 4A). We also observed posture, mobility,
skin, and fur and made histopathological assessments of
the stomach, intestine, and liver by hematoxylin and eosin
staining on day 21 after DLI. We observed no tissue damage
or pathological changes in DLI recipients injected with
BM-T cells. In contrast, mice that received SP-T cells
showed lymphocytic infiltration in the periportal area and
tissue damage in the liver and intestine (Fig. 4B). These
results indicate that BM-T cells prevented GVHD
development and that SP-T cells induced severe GVHD in
our DLI models.
In vitro evidence for ongoing alloreactivity of BM-T
(Thy1.2+) cells in chimeric mice
To investigate the ability of BM-T cells to mount
alloreactivity after infusion into mixed chimeric mice, we
tested the capacity of BM-T cells to mount a proliferative
response in vitro in a standard mixed lymphocyte
reaction. The proliferative response of BM-T cells was
higher than that of SP-T cells (mean±SD SI: 2.19±0.1

than that of SP-T cells (mean±SD SI: 3.15±0.1 versus 1.18
±0.3, p<0.05) of mixed chimeric mice. This result suggests
that BM-T cells had high alloreactivity but did not develop
GVHD. This alloreactivity was apparently effective in
chimeric conversion but did not induce GVHD (Fig. 5).
Characteristics of BM-T (Thy1.2+) and SP-T
(Thy1.2+) cells
Although several studies have investigated T cells in
BM and spleen, differences in function and characteristics
between BM-T and SP-T cells have not been defined.
Clarification of the biological characteristics of BM-T
and SP-T cells is important because it may explain the
mechanism of chimeric conversion through BM-T cells.
Therefore, we analyzed the percentages of immune cells
(i.e., T cells, NKT cells [NKT cells], NK cells) in BM and
spleen using well-known fluorescence-conjugated
phenotypic markers. The expression of specific surface
markers of isolated T cells from BM and spleen was
evaluated by flow cytometry. The CD4/CD8 ratios of
BMT and SP-T cells were 20.1±1.8%: 37.0±2.1% and
48.6±0.5%: 44.3±1.4%, respectively. BM-T cells contained
a high percentage of CD8 T cells. In particular, the per-
centages of TCRβ+NK1.1+ cells (13.2±3.9%) and TCRβ−
NK1.1+ cells (9.8±2.4%) in BM-T cells were higher than
those in SP-T cells (3.3±0.1% and 0.9±0.2%, respectively,
Table 1). However, these approaches have not been
sufficiently well developed to be generally accepted, as
demonstrated by the unresolved problems of the correct
function of NKTs and subpopulations of T cells.
DISCUSSION
Although BM is a primary lymphoid organ for the
development of mature B cells and precursor T cells, its
role in mature T-cell responses has often been neglected.
Recently, the biological characteristics of BM-T cells were
distinguished from those of blood T cells by their unique
patterns of surface receptors, cytokine secretion, and
immune functions [6]. First, the makeup of T-cell subsets
in BM differs from that in peripheral T cells, and BM-T
cells contain an unusually high proportion of NKT cells
(15-50% of the BM TCR αβ+ cells), although TCR αβ+
cells constitute 3-8% of nucleated BM cells in humans and
mice [21,22]. BM NK1.1-T cells do not induce GVHD, but
those in the blood can induce lethal GVHD [23]. Second,
long after priming, memory CD8 cells proliferate more
extensively in the BM than they do in either secondary
lymphoid or extra-lymphoid organs [8,9]. The CD4:CD8
ratio in the BM is about -1:2, which is inverted in com-
parison to the ratio found in peripheral lymph nodes and
the blood, which ranges from -2:1 to -2.5:10 [6,22]. CD8+
T cells in donor BM grafts have the unique capacity to
facilitate complete chimerism and eliminate tumor cells
without non-lymphohematopoietic tissue injury [12,24].
Third, BM-T cell populations contain a high proportion of
cells that display a memory phenotype that expresses low
levels of CD45RA in humans [10] and high levels of
CD44 in mice, because memory T cells migrate to the BM
after priming [9,25,26]. BM memory CD8+ cells are more
activated that their splenic counterparts and have a higher
rate of local proliferation [8,11].
Hematopoietic stem cells reside in the peripheral
blood following mobilization by the administration of
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, as well as in the

BM. Recently, peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafting
has been used instead of BM grafting [27]. In earlier
reports, PBSC transplantation showed rapid hematological
recovery, lower transplantation-related mortality, and
higher leukemia-free survival rates without increased risk
of GVHD compared to BMT [28]. However, more recent
reports have suggested worse outcomes and more chronic
GVHD with PBSC than BM in HLA-matched sibling
donor transplants in young patients [29-31]. These clinical
observations suggest that these outcomes may result
primarily from the different biological characteristics of
T cells within PBSC and BM grafts. In the present study,
BM-T (Thy1.2+) cells in DLI were more potent than SP-T
(Thy1.2+) cells at inducing the conversion of mixed to full
donor chimerism on day 21. Additionally, donor BM-T
(Thy1.2+) cells facilitated conversion to full donor
chimerism without GVHD, but donor SP-T (Thy1.2+) cells
did not affect the degree of donor chimerism despite
evidence of pathological changes consistent with GVHD.
These results suggest that BM-T cells within BM grafts
or DLI are superior to SP-T cells within PBSC grafts or
DLI at safely inducing beneficial alloreactivity and the
graft-versus-host reaction.
Although we did not precisely clarify the immunological
mechanism of the more favorable clinical outcome after
DLI using BM-T cells compared with SP-T cells, we
speculate that several cell types might be potential
candidates as key effector cells for complete chimeric
conversion without the occurrence of GVHD. First, donor-
derived NK-cell-based DLI was used safely to facilitate
engraftment and induce graft-versus-tumor effects,
because alloreactive NK cells have not been implicated in
GVHD [22,33,34]. Our study shows that NK cells in
purified BM-T (Thy1.2+) cells are about 10-fold higher
than in purified SP-T (Thy1.2+) cells. Second, CD8+ T
cells in the donor BM had a unique ability to eliminate
normal and malignant host lymphohematopoietic cells
without causing GVHD in nonmyeloablated hosts [12].
In contrast, donor CD8+ T cells from tissue sources
outside the BM (lymph nodes and spleen) are capable of
eliminating lymphohe-matopoietic tumors and facilitating
stem cell engraftment in myeloablated hosts, but lethal
GVHD is observed as the dose of purified CD8+ T cells is
increased to achieve uniform tumor elimination [35,36].
Third, CD4+CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are
more numerous in BM than in the thymus, lymph nodes,
or blood, and BM CD4+CD25+ Foxp3+T cells are
functional Tregs that mediate suppressive effects by
inhibiting T cells. BM is an important site for T cell
priming, migration or selective retention, function of
Tregs, and harboring of antigen-specific memory T cells
[37].
NMT leads to an initial state of lymphohematopoietic
mixed chimerism, defined as the coexistence of donor-
and recipient-derived lymphohematopoiesis. Allogeneic
mixed chimerism can provide an immunological platform
for adoptive immunotherapy with DLI for patients with
malignant disease, as host T cells can resist GVHD medi-
ated by DLI. In addition, the induction of mixed chimerism
followed by delayed DLI provides an approach for
inhibiting GVHD that optimizes GVL effects [15]. For this
purpose, DLI may be an effective therapeutic intervention
for patients with labile engraftment or with various
hematological malignancies that have relapsed after BMT
[17]. In the present study, during the TCD procedure in
BM grafting, BM-T (Thy1.2+) cells, a by-product, could be
obtained and then cryopreserved for DLI in the early post-
BMT period. Cryopreserved BM-T cells, even in small
numbers, provided sufficient allore-activity to induce
complete chimeric conversion in allo-geneic mixed
chimeras. Based on our results, we cautiously suggest that
a small number of cryopreserved BM-T cells, a surplus
obtained during BM harvesting, may be used effectively to
consolidate donor-dominant chimerism or induce a GVL
effect without concerns of GVHD following NMT.
In summary, we have demonstrated that compared to
peripheral T cells, BM-T cells, even in small doses, have a
more potent ability to induce chimeric conversion without
the occurrence of GVHD despite a DLI operation in the
early stages after transplantation. Additionally, our study
suggest that DLI using BM cells might be used instead of
DLI using peripheral lymphocytes to induce a beneficial
alloreactive T cell response, such as chimeric conversion
in clinical practice. Further clinical studies are needed to
develop this concept from animal models to clinical prac-
tice.
