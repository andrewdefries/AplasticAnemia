INTRODUCTION
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an impor-
tant differential diagnosis in infants and children who present
with prolonged fever, pancytopenia, splenomegaly, marked
triglyceridemia, and systemic hypercytokinemia without evi-
dence of aplastic anemia or malignancy (1-4). In this disor-
der of the mononuclear phagocytic system, infiltrating lym-
phocytes and histiocytes destroy the central nervous system
(CNS), bone marrow, and other organs (1). HLH occurs in
both primary (familial) and secondary (infection- or malig-
nancy-associated) forms (1-5). Although fatal cases occur most
often in patients with the familial form (FHL) rather than
the virus-associated form (VAHS), Epstein Barr virus-asso-
ciated HLH (EBV-HLH) is implicated in the pathogenesis
of fatal VAHS (1, 6-8).
The pathogenesis of EBV-HLH remains poorly understood,
although the findings of several recent studies support the
concept that the monoclonal proliferation of EBV-infected
T cells may be a primary feature of EBV-HLH (9-11). The
more common explanation is that EBV-infected B cells trig-
ger polyclonal proliferation of cytotoxic T cells, which in turn
stimulate histiocytes and macrophages (1). However, EBV
may also target T cells directly in EBV-HLH (1, 10). Most
EBV-infected cells are CD8+
T cells in EBV-HLH and CD4+
T cells or NK cells in chronic active EBV infection; in con-
trast, most EBV-infected cells are B cells in acute infectious
mononucleosis (12).
The HLH Study Group of the Histiocyte Society and other
study groups have long sought to improve the clinical out-
come of FHS and VAHS by combining established induction
regimens such as epipodophyllotoxins, intrathecal methotrex-
ate, and steroids, with newer forms of immunomodulatory
therapy to maintain remission until an acceptable marrow
donor is found (2, 3). We now report the results of immuno-
chemotherapy in four patients with EBV-HLH treated from
2001 to 2004 at Chungbuk National University Hospital
in Korea.

Successful Treatment of Epstein-Barr Virus-Associated
Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis with HLH-94 Protocol
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, fatal disorder of children,
affecting predominantly the mononuclear phagocytic system. Previous reports
indicate that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocy-
tosis (EBV-HLH) can also be fatal in many cases, although the prognosis for EBV-
HLH is better than for the familial form of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. We
treated four patients with EBV-HLH using immunochemotherapy including steroid,
etoposide (VP-16), and cyclosporin, according to the HLH-94 protocol. All patients
experienced persistent fever, cytopenia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Serological
testing for EBV showed reactivated EBV infections in all patients. EBV DNA detect-
ed by PCR and EBV-encoded small RNA measured by in situ hybridization were
confirmed in the patients’ bone marrow specimens. Hemophagocytosis was shown
in bone marrow aspirates and liver biopsy specimen. Complete remission was
achieved in all patients after induction and continuation therapy for 4-10 months
(median, 7 months) and was maintained for 15-27 months (median, 19 months)
without the need for bone marrow transplantation. These results suggest that
EBV-HLH can be effectively controlled by immunochemotherapy using the HLH-
94 protocol.

perature ≥38.5℃, splenomegaly, cytopenia affecting at least
two lineages in the peripheral blood not caused by a hypocel-
lular or dysplastic bone marrow, and hypertriglyceridemia
(fasting triglycerides >3 SD or 177 mg/dL) or hypofibrino-
genemia (fibrinogen <3 SD or 150 mg/dL) that raised strong
suspicion of hemophagocytic syndrome (2, 3). Bone marrow
aspiration was performed in all patients and a liver biopsy
was performed in one patient (Patient 3) for cytomorphologi-
cal analysis.
EBV virologic studies
EBV infection was demonstrated by serology, polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), and in situ hybridization.
Serological tests for EBV infection were based on viral cap-
sid antigen (VCA)-IgG/IgM, early antigen (EA)-DR-IgG/
IgM and Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) anti-
body titers.
Bone marrow cells of patients were examined for the pres-
ence of EBV DNA by PCR. DNA was extracted from bone
marrow cells with 100 L of 5% Chelax resin (Bio-Rad Labo-
ratories, Hercules, CA, U.S.A.) and two cycles of heating (up
to 100℃) and cooling. Five microliters of the DNA eluate
was used for amplification of EBV DNA, with 250 nM con-
centration of sense and antisense primers (5 -TGATAACCA-
TGGACGAGGAC-3 and 5 -GCAGCCAATGCAACTTG-
GAC-3 , respectively) that correspond to the 139 base-pair
fragment of the Epstein Barr Nuclear Antigen-1 (EBNA-1),
and Accupower�
PCR PreMix (Bioneer, Daejoen, Korea).
PCR was performed using 5 min of denaturation at 95℃,
35 cycles of 1 min at 94℃, 1.5 min at 57℃, 2 min at 72℃,
and finally 10 min at 72℃. The PCR products were ana-
lyzed by electrophoresis using 2% agarose gels. DNA from
EBV-transformed human B-cell lines (IM-9) and human T-
leukemic cell lines (Molt-4) were used as positive and nega-
tive controls, respectively.
In situ hybridization of EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER)
was performed according to a modification of a previously
described cDNA-mRNA in situ hybridization method, using
the manual Microbe System (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh,
PA, U.S.A.) (13). Briefly, 5 m thick bone marrow sections
were placed on the distal one-third of Probe-On positively
charged slides. The specimens were deparaffinized with Hemo-
de (xylene substitute) at a ratio of 3:1 for 5 min, placed in
100% alcohol for 45 sec, and rehydrated with 1 Automation
Buffer (Biomeda, Foster City, CA, U.S.A.). The specimens
were digested with pepsin (pH 2.0) for 6 min at 110℃ and
immediately washed in distilled water for 30 sec. The biotiny-
lated cDNA oligonucleotide probe (Research Genetics, Hunts-
ville, AL, U.S.A.) to EBER-mRNA was reconstituted to 1 g/
L solution in 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), diluted to a concentra-
tion of 200 ng/mL in the probe cocktail containing 12.5%
(v/v) formamide, 0.5% (w/v) chondroitin sulfate, 675 mM
sodium chloride, 138 mM sodium citratem, 12 mM sodi-
um phosphate monobasic, 63 mM sodium dibasic, 0.1% (v/v)
Tween 20 (JT Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ, U.S.A.) and 1:100,000
diluted random 9-mers (Research Genetics). This probe mix-
ture was applied for 10 min at 92℃ and 30 min at 45℃ to
hybridize with target nucleic acids in the specimens. After
hybridization, the specimens were washed in 5×SSC for 3
min and 2×SSC for 3 min at room temperature. Detection
of hybridized biotin probes was performed with avidin-alka-
line phosphatase (Dako, Carpenteria, CA, U.S.A.), diluted
1:200 in Tris buffer (pH 8.0), and signal localization was ob-
tained with the naphthol AS-MX phosphate/Fast Red TR
chromogen solution. The slides were washed with distilled
water, counterstained with hematoxylin for 5 sec, and cov-
erslips applied with Universal Mount (Research Genetics).
Treatment regimens
The core elements of induction chemotherapy were steroids
and etoposide (VP-16). The starting doses were 10 mg/m2
per day oral dexamethasone and 150 mg/m2
per dose intra-
venous etoposide twice a week. Remission induction thera-
py, either closely or entirely, followed the HLH-94 protocol
in all patients (1-3).
The aim of continuation treatment is to sustain resolution
of the disease (2, 3). After eight weeks of induction chemo-
therapy, a complete response (CR) was defined as an unequivo-
cal resolution of clinical signs and symptoms and the nor-
malization of laboratory findings, including data obtained
from imaging studies and resolution of hemophagocytosis on
bone marrow study. Patients with persistent fever and other
symptoms of HLH, abnormally high serum ferritin concen-
tration or remaining hemophagocytosis on bone marrow
study were considered to have a partial response (PR) and
were placed on intensified or maintenance regimens until CR
was induced. The continuation therapy from week 9 com-
prised 10 mg/m2
dexamethasone pulses for three days every
second week and 150 mg/m2
etoposide infusions on alternat-
ing weeks in combination with daily oral cyclosporin (CSA)
(1-3).
RESULTS
Characteristics of patients and laboratory findings
The mean age at diagnosis was 5.2 yr (range 2.3-13.0); two
patients were boys and two were girls. The patients had pro-
longed fever, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopa-
thy and/or neurological symptoms with cytopenia. None of
the patients had a family history of HLH (Table 1).
At the time of diagnosis, the serum ferritin concentrations
were 364 ng/mL-24,295 ng/mL (normal range 15-332 ng/
mL) and the serum lactate dehydrogenase levels were 2,357
IU/L-5,540 IU/L (normal range 180-460 IU/L) (Table 2).

Serological testing for EBV showed an elevated VCA-IgG
(normal range 0.9-1.09 U/mL), with increased EA-IgG titers
(normal range 0.9-1.09 U/mL) indicating reactivated EBV
infections in all patients (Table 3). EBV DNA was detected
by PCR in Patient 1 and 4 (Fig. 1) and EBER was detected
by in situ hybridization in bone marrow specimens of the
three patients (Fig. 2). Hemophagocytosis was shown in the
bone marrow aspirates of all patients (Fig. 3) and liver biop-
sy specimen of Patient 3 (data not shown). There were no
chromosomal anomalies of peripheral blood mononuclear
cells or bone marrow cells (data not shown).
Clinical courses and treatment response
During the first eight weeks of therapy, the four patients
exhibited PR and were placed on continuation treatment.
Patients were provided therapy for a median of seven months
(range 4-10 months) (Table 4).
On hospital day 2, Patient 1 suffered a pulmonary hem-
orrhage requiring ventilator care; immunochemotherapy by
HLH-94 and continuous CSA infusion were started. Severe
neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 48/ L) without evi-
dence of bacterial infection during remission induction led to
temporary withdrawal of all cytoreductive therapy and con-
tinuous infusions of CSA for 11 days. On hospital day 27,
the patient achieved hematopoietic recovery and was able to
restart his scheduled chemotherapy. However, this patient was
considered to have a PR after induction treatment, because
serum ferritin concentration was 374 ng/mL, which was above
the normal range. After continuation treatment, the patient
achieved CR and his serum ferritin concentration normalized.

sion. She presented with neurological deterioration and a brain
MRI showed increased signal in the head of the caudate nucle-
us, medial portion of the thalamus, right lentiform nucleus,
cortex and subcortical white matter of the right temporal
lobe, and periaqueductal gray matter. Tests for serum anti-
nuclear antibody and anti-double-stranded DNA were nega-
tive. She received medication including antibiotics, antiviral
agents, and antifungal agents. On hospital day 2, pancytope-
nia developed and her bone marrow aspirate was characterized
by infiltration of hemophagocytosis. Immunochemothera-
peutic agents including dexamethasone, etoposide, CSA, and
intrathecal methotrexate were administered immediately and
her neurological symptoms improved. However, all immuno-
chemotherapy except dexamethasone was stopped because of
severe bone marrow suppression. Six days after the cessation
of immunochemotherapy, cranial nerve VI palsy occurred sud-
denly, but it was treated successfully with etoposide and high
dose dexamethasone. There was no hemophagocytosis in the
bone marrow after one month of chemotherapy. Abnormal
brain imaging remained after induction therapy, and she was
treated by continuation therapy with HLH-94 protocol. The
brain MRI abnormalities resolved after continuation treatment
for 10 months. Dexamethasone was discontinued because of
progressive abdominal striae and she showed poor compliance
to oral CSA. Although CR was attained, she dropped out of
the follow-up 20 months after the onset of disease.
Patient 3 received prednisolone and cyclophosphamide and
switched to induction treatment by the HLH-94 regimen
from hospital day 2. His liver biopsy demonstrated some his-
tiocytic infiltration in the liver sinusoid. Although the patient
had shown persistent hepatomegaly over five months, hemo-
phagocytosis subsided after induction treatment.
Patient 4 was admitted with prolonged fever, hepatosple-
nomegaly, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Immunoche-
motherapy by HLH-94 from hospital day 5 appeared to suc-
cessfully induce CR. However, at the end of induction treat-
ment, she presented with recurrent fever, hepatosplenomegaly,
and pancytopenia; hemophagocytic histiocytes were noted
again in bone marrow, indicating reactivation. The induction

DISCUSSION
EBV-HLH poses unusual challenges to pediatric hematolo-
gists. The reactive disorder may be difficult to distinguish
from infectious mononucleosis, septicemia, certain hemato-
logical malignancies, and systemic autoimmune disorders
(1). Patients in our study met most of the HLH diagnostic
criteria proposed by Henter et al. and lacked a family history
of HLH (2-4). It is sometimes difficult to make a clear dis-
tinction between FHL and VAHS (8, 14). We believe that
our clinical and laboratory findings support the diagnosis of
EBV-HLH in our patients. Our diagnosis was based on sero-
logical evidence of initial or previous exposure to EBV (e.g.,
elevated VCA-IgM or IgG) or reactivation (e.g., elevated EA-
DR-IgG) and molecular evidence such as detection of EBV
genomic DNA by PCR and EBER by in situ hybridization
in bone marrow cells (9, 15). We suggest that sometimes
therapy should be started when there is a strong clinical sus-
picion of HLH, although the patient may not necessarily ful-
fill all the diagnostic criteria.
The HLH Study Group began its first international treat-
ment strategy dedicated to HLH using HLH-94 in January
1995 (3). Many studies since then have recommended simi-
lar therapeutic approaches to newly diagnosed cases of EBV-
HLH (1-3). Steroids and etoposide are common treatment
agents in both the induction phase and the continuation phase
for patients who show resistance to other agents (1-3). Early
introduction of an etoposide-based regimen is purported to
be a critical factor in securing long-term survival in patients
with EBV-HLH (16-18). However, increased incidence of
acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome can
occur following the use of etoposide (2, 19). In children with
obscure CNS symptoms and a progressive encephalopathy,
HLH should be considered as the differential diagnosis because
the inflammatory meningoencephalopathy in HLH may cause
severe and permanent CNS dysfunction (20, 21). Systemic
therapy including dexamethasone, which penetrates the blood-
brain barrier well, is first line therapy in HLH-94 protocol
(3, 21). Because it has not yet been determined whether intra-
thecal therapy in combination with systemic dexamethasone
is beneficial, the HLH-94 protocol reserves intrathecal ther-
apy for those with clinical evidence of CNS progression or
unimproved CSF pleocytosis (2, 3).
A prompt, short-term CSA infusion is recommended dur-
ing neutropenic episodes. CSA, which has not been widely
used in therapy for EBV-HLH, seems to control the deregu-
lated release of cytokines and their receptors in patients with
neutropenia (1, 22). Improved neutrophil recovery caused by
CSA treatment makes it possible to continue immunochemo-
therapy safely and to obtain better outcomes (18, 23). CSA
can now be added to induction treatment in the HLH-2004
protocol by the HLH Study Group. Imashuku et al. suggest-
ed that the choice of treatment should be based on the risk
factors, and that CSA, steroids, or intravenous immunoglobu-
lin (IVIG) may be indicated as initial treatment for low-risk
patients and etoposide-containing regimens for high-risk
patients (23). Although the value of IVIG for induction thera-
py is controversial (1, 20, 25), IVIG infusion is recommend-
ed once every four weeks as supportive therapy in the HLH-
2004 protocol. It is controversial whether granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor (G-CSF) promotes hematological recovery
without disease progression (25, 26).
It is now possible to control a high proportion of EBV-HLH
cases without resorting to bone marrow transplantation (BMT)
(27). Imashuku et al. reported that 13 of their 17 EBV-HLH
patients needed continuation treatment with etoposide and
steroids with or without CSA or other forms of chemothera-
py; BMT was performed in only two patients who showed
resistance to all available immunochemotherapy (1). Allogenic
BMT is associated with high morbidity and should be held
in reserve and used only for patients with highly continuous
refractory disease (1-3). One study reported that 20 of 23
children with nonfamilial HLH were alive and off therapy
for more than 12 months without BMT and that most cases
(12 of 20 or 60%) were from East Asia (2). Imashuku et al.
reported a 78.3±6.7% four-year survival outcome when
most patients (85%) were treated with etoposide-containing
regimens such as the HLH-94 protocol (16, 28). All of our
patients treated with HLH-94 immunochemotherapy are
alive without evidence of disease 15 to 27 months (median,
19 months) after treatment. None of our patients was con-
sidered refractory to chemotherapy and none required BMT.
We suggest that EBV-HLH can be cured with early introduc-
tion of immunochemotherapy based on HLH-94 protocol.
