Novel influenza A (H1N1) 2009 infection in the
pediatric patients with hematologic and oncologic
diseases in the Yeungnam region in Korea
Purpose: Natural history and consequences of the novel 2009
influenza A H1N1 (2009 H1N1) infection in immunocompromised
pediatric patients are not yet fully understood. In this study, we
investigated the clinical features and outcomes of the 2009 H1N1
infection in pediatric patients with hematological and oncological
diseases.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 528
patients who had hematological and oncological diseases and who
were treated at 7 referral centers located in the Yeungnam region.
Among the 528 patients, 27 with definite diagnosis of 2009 H1N1 in­
fection were the subjects of this study. All patients were divided into
the following 3 groups: patients who were receiving chemotherapy
(group 1), patients who were immunosuppressed due to a non-
malignant hematological disease (group 2), and patients who were off
chemotherapy and had undergone their last chemotherapy course
within 2 years from the influenza A pandemic (group 3).
Results: All 28 episodes of 2009 H1N1 infection were treated with
the antiviral agent oseltamivir (Tamiflu®
), and 20 episodes were
treated after hospitalization. Group 1 patients had higher frequencies
of lower respiratory tract infection and longer durations of fever
and hospitalization as compared to those in group 2. Ultimately, all
episodes resolved completely with no complications.
Conclusion: These results suggest that early antiviral therapy did
not influence the morbidity or mortality of pediatric patients with
hematological and oncological diseases in the Yeungnam region of
Korea after the 2009 H1N1 infection. However, no definite conclusions
can be drawn because of the small sample size.

118 SJ Kang, et al. • 2009 H1N1 infection in the pediatric hemato-oncologic patients
Introduction
A novel swine-originating influenza A H1N1 virus spread rapidly
around the world in 2009, and on June 11, 2009, the World Health
Organization raised the pandemic alert level to phase 6, indicating
thataglobalpandemichadbegun1)
.
Initial reports suggested that illness associated with the pandemic
2009 influenza H1N1 (2009 H1N1) infection might be mild
compared with the 1918 influenza pandemic2, 3)
. However, recently
published series that included 122 children with confirmed 2009
H1N1 infection, reported a high prevalence of underlying medical
conditions and described the need for intensive care and mechanical
ventilation in 20% and 10% of patients, respectively4)
. In Korea,
Shin et al.5)
reported that high-risk pediatric patients had an elevated
mortality rate following infection with novel influenza A (H1N1)
virus.
In May, 2009, the first case of the 2009 H1N1 infection was
identified in Korea. By February, 2010, 243 deaths had been re­
ported6)
. Risk factors for severe complications of the 2009 H1N1
infection include chronic lung disease, heart disease, pregnancy,
immunosuppression,andneurodevelopmentaldisorders3,5,7)
.Patients
with hematological and oncological diseases are more susceptible
to acquiring infections than the general population and potentially
develop more complications. Because of disruptions in both innate
and acquired immunity, even organisms with low virulence are
able to cause significant morbidity and mortality8)
. There are several
reports that the 2009 H1N1 infection in adults with hematological
malignancies may have lead to severe complications9-11)
, although 49
adult patients with cancer and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplant
(HSCT) who were diagnosed with the 2009 H1N1 infection had
mild symptoms12)
. However, the reports on the natural history and
the consequences of the 2009 H1N1 infection among the pediatric
immunocompromised patients are very rare. Launes13)
reported
that the 2009 H1N1 infection in pediatric patients with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia under maintenance treatment had a mild
disease while children receiving intensive treatment had more severe
diseases. Caselli et al.14)
reported that the 2009 H1N1 infection in
childrenwithcancerwasnotthecauseofdeathinanycase.
This study was conducted to investigate the clinical features and
the outcomes of the 2009 H1N1 infection in pediatric patients with
the hematologic and oncologic diseases in the Yeungnam region of
Korea.
Materials and methods
1.Patients
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of the 528
patients under the age of 20 years who had hematological and on­
cological diseases and were treated at seven referral centers located
in the Yeungnam region, between September, 2009 and February,
2010 (pandemic influenza A 2009). All patients were divided into
three groups. Group 1 consisted of the patients who were receiving
chemotherapy for malignancy during the study period (n=245).
Group 2 consisted of patients who were immunosuppressed due
to a non-malignant hematological disease, such as aplastic anemia,
and those who had undergone a splenectomy for the treatment of
hemolytic anemia (n=90). Group 3 consisted of patients who were
off chemotherapy and had received their last chemotherapy within 2
yearsfromtheinfluenzaApandemic(n=193).
Of these 528 patients, 27 patients identified as having the 2009
H1N1infectionswerethesubjectsofthisstudy.Noneofthemexcept
onewerevaccinatedpriorto2009H1N1outbreak.
2.Methods
Laboratory diagnosis of the 2009 H1N1 infection was confirmed
by the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction
assays (ExicyclorⓇ
96, Bioneer Inc, Alameda, CA, USA; Applied
Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System, Applied Biosystem, Foster
City, CA, USA) of a nasopharyngeal swab. Upper respiratory tract
infection was defined as the presence of pharyngeal congestion and/
or rhinorrhea in the absence of lower respiratory tract symptoms,
with normal chest X-ray findings. Lower respiratory tract infection
was defined as the presence of the clinical findings such as coughing,
hypoxia, dyspnea, wheezing, and rales with new pulmonary
infiltrationsonchestX-ray.
Laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Neutropenia was
defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 1,000/
µL in infants between 2 weeks and 1 year of age and less than 1,500/
µL beyond 1 year of age. Severe neutropenia was defined as an
ANC of less than 500/µL. Lymphopenia was defined as an absolute
lymphocyte count (ALC) of less than 1,800/µL in children under 2
yearsofageandlessthan1,000/µLinchildrenbeyond2yearsofage.
3.Statisticalanalyses
Results are expressed as mean values, median values, and ranges.
Statistical analyses were performed using Fisher’s exact test, Kruskall-
Wallis test, and the Mann-Whitney test. Significance was set atP<
0.05. The SPSS (version 18.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was used
forstatisticalanalyses.

2.Clinicalpresentations
The common symptoms presented at the time of diagnosis
of the 2009 H1N1 were coughing and fever among all groups.
Rhinorrhea/nasal stuffiness and sputum are the next common. The
gastrointestinal symptoms were not seen other than vomiting (n=3,
11%). Neurological symptoms of headache were noted in 8 patients
(28%) totally, and 4 cases in group 1. No statistical significant
differences between groups were detected in the clinical features
except duration of fever (Table 2). The mean duration of fever was
3.7±3.1 days in group 1, 2.7±0.6 days in group 2, 1.1±1.1 days in
group 3, and totally 2.8±2.7 days. The mean duration of fever was

the 21 episodes, leucopenia was revealed in 15 (71%), neutropenia in
11 (52%), severe neutropenia in 6 (28.5%). Lymphopenia was seen
in 18 (85%) and the median ALC was 328/µL (range, 19‒3,254/
µL). Thrombocytopenia was noted in 12 (57%). Twelve (57%) had
an elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level (>45 IU/L) and
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level (>55 IU/L for children <10
years of age and >45 IU/L for children ≥10 years of age). C-reactive

4.Outcomes
For 20 (71%) patients of total 28 episodes were treated after
hospitalization. The median duration of the hospitalization was 8
(range, 3‒87) days. In three cases, the durations of hospitalization
were longer than 15 days. They had been newly diagnosed as Ewing
sarcoma, lymphoma, and acute myeloblastic leukemia, and their
durationofadmissionwasprolongedforchemotherapy.
Significant differences between groups were detected in the
frequencies of lower respiratory tract infection (P=0.03), admission
(P<0.001), and durations of fever (P=0.022) and hospitalization
(P=0.001). Group 1 had higher frequencies of lower respiratory tract
infection and longer durations of fever and hospitalization (Table
4). Between the patients with lymphopenia and neutropenia, no
difference was detected in the frequency of lower respiratory tract
infectionordurationoffeverorhospitalization(Table5).
Allepisodesweretreatedwithoseltamivir(TamifluⓇ
,Roche,Basel,
Switzerland) at a dose calculated based on patient body weight12)
. All
treated patients tolerated Tamiflu well. Tamiflu was administered for
a median of 1 day (range, 1‒9 days) after onset of initial symptoms.
Within a median of 1 day initial symptoms had subsided. As si­
multaneous bacterial infection could not be ruled out, 20 cases of
hospitalized patients received systemic antibiotics in addition to

Discussion
Seasonal influenza A infection has been associated with high
mor­bidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. In
pre­vious retrospective reports, seasonal influenza among patients
with impaired immunity was associated with higher incidences of
pneumonia and fatality. Chemaly et al.15)
reported the overall mor­
tality rate for community acquired respiratory viral pneumonia
was 15% among HSCT recipients and patients with hematological
malignancies. Mendoza Sanchez et al. noted that common respi­
ratory virus infections in children with cancer or HIV infection have
significant morbidity16)
. Pediatric oncology patients experienced
significantinfluenza-associatedmorbidities17)
.
The clinical outcomes of the 2009 H1N1 infection in the pediatric
patients with hematological and oncological diseases are not fully
understood and are still being defined. Several studies have reported
fatal cases in adults with cancers and in HSCT recipients9‒11)
.
Recently, Caselli et al.14)
reported that the 2009 H1N1 infection in
children with cancer was not the cause of death in any case; however,
itresultedinreducedintensityofanti-cancertherapy.
In this retrospective study, we sought to investigate the clinical
fea­tures and the outcomes of the 2009 H1N1 infection in the pedi­
atric patients with hematological and oncological diseases who
were potentially vulnerable to infections because of underlying
immunosuppression. No patient required mechanical ventilation
and no deaths were observed to be directly related to the 2009 H1N1
infections in this study. Most patients had mild disease and they
recovered completely without complications related to the 2009
H1N1infection.
When all episodes were grouped by disease status, statistically
significant differences were observed between the groups in duration
of fever and the hospitalization and development of lower respiratory
tract infection. Most group 1 patients, who were on chemotherapy
for their malignancy, had low lymphocyte and neutrophil counts
at diagnosis of the 2009 H1N1 infection. Indeed, 10 patients
had lymphopenia and nine had neutropenia. Previous studies in
immunocompromised hosts with seasonal influenza found that
lym­phopenia was associated with prolonged shedding, a higher
chance of the virus developing drug resistance during treatment,
and pneumonia2, 11, 15, 18)
. We did not obtain information on viral
shedding; however, our study shows that all patients with the 2009
H1N1 infections recovered clinically, regardless of lymphopenia or
neutropenia.
These patients have been closely monitored and carefully treated.
Because of the nature of the patients with hematologic and oncologic
diseases, they were not readily vaccinated but tend to visit hospital
earlier. Therefore, active treatment was possible at early stage of the
disease.
This study had some limitations. The small sample size of this
study does not allow for definite conclusions about the 2009
H1N1 infections in hematologic and oncologic pediatric patients.
It is unclear whether patients treated in the Yeungnam region
were representative of the greater population of hematological and
oncologicalpediatricpatients.
In summary, most pediatric patients with hematological and
oncological diseases in the Yeungnam region, Korea, had favorable,
and not fatal, courses from the 2009 H1N1 infection. As with the
general population, coughing and fever were the most common
symptoms. We conclude that pediatric patients with hematological
and oncological diseases did not have increased morbidity or
mortality following infection with H1N1 infection if they were
treatedwiththeantiviralagentTamifluduringtheearlystages.
