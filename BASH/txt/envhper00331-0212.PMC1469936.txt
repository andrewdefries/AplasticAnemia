In estimating the cancer mortality risk for radiation workers it is conventional to use data obtained
from the populations exposed to radiation as a result of the atomic bomb blast in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. This A-bomb experience resulted in relatively high doses of radiation and short periods
of exposure. The availability of systematic analyses of the mortality of workers at the Hanford
plant (Washington state) provides a more realistic basis for individual risk estimates. We present
the data for three functions that in combination provide useful guidelines for occupational cancer
mortality risk. These functions are a relationship between age at exposure, latency between
exposure and death, and a dose-response function. Although other estimates of such functions
are possible using different populations and assumptions, we offer these functions as guidelines
for individual cancer risk evaluation based on our analyses of the Hanford data. Environ Health

Introduction
Conventional analysis of occupational
radiation risk for cancer in individual
workers is based primarily on recommen-
dations of the International Commission
on Radiation Protection (ICRP) (1),
which in turn are based on the experience
of A-bomb-exposed populations (2).
These estimates are in agreement with
those based on radiotherapy for ankylosing
spondylitis (3). Both exposures are rela-
tively brief and intense compared to what
might be expected for radiation workers;
therefore, both require some form of
extrapolation to reflect the lower dose rate
and generally lower exposures ofworkers.
Such estimates are not in agreement
with either the dose-response data for
in utero exposures to X-rays (4) or the data
This paper is based on a presentation at the
International Conference on Radiation and Health

for a large population of Hanford workers
[which will be referred to as the MSK
studies, based on the work of Mancuso,
Stewart, and Kneale (5-7)]. As it seems
most logical to estimate occupational risk
using data from the actual experiences of a
population of workers, our suggested
approach is based on the MSK data.
Additional experience may indicate that
the functions we propose must be modi-
fied for different kinds of populations or
exposures. Nevertheless, we believe that
the use of data from the experiences of
working populations is to be preferred to
the present approach, which is based on
ICRP recommendations.
Differences between
ICRP Recommendations
and MSK Risk Estimates
Neither Hanford workers nor the children
who were X-rayed in utero experienced
high radiation doses, but some A-bomb
survivors and all of the radiotherapy
patients had doses that were well above the
lowest level associated with bone marrow
damage. The effects of such damage
include loss of immunological competence
(with heightened sensitivity to infection)
and possibly the eventual development of
aplastic anemia. Therefore, the disparity
between ICRP recommendations and
MSK risk estimates might be the result of
the ICRP failing to recognize that at high
dose levels cancer is not the only late effect
ofradiation.
There is some evidence to support this
theory (8). It is unlikely that A-bomb
data will always be the basis for ICRP
recommendations regarding radiation
workers and it is almost certain that esti-
mates eventually will be based on the
cumulative experience of worker popula-
tions. Therefore, all medical and legal
advisors to radiation workers should be
able to apply MSK risk estimates to work-
ers whose records include annual doses of
external radiation.
Hanford Data
Hanford data relate to 30,000 workers
from a reprocessing plant that is so highly
mechanized that over a period of more
than 30 years (1944 to 1975), individual
monitoring by film badges and bioassay
tests for external and internal radiation
found only 15 workers whose doses of
external radiation exceeded 5 rads/year and
225 workers with any evidence of internal
radiation. Therefore, the Hanford data
should be a reliable source of risk estimates
for delayed effects of repeated exposure to
small doses ofexternal radiation.
Deaths of Hanford workers were
ascertained by periodic screening of Social
Security numbers for death benefit claims
and later by identification of the death
certificates of these ex-workers. Therefore,
measures ofrelative risk (RR), which require
only comparisons between different dose
levels, were obtained more easily than
measures ofabsolute risk. The latter require
comparisons between survey data and
national statistics and are valid only if the
worker population is a true cross-section
ofthe nation.
Thus far only primary causes of death
have been used as indicators for radiation
health effects. Therefore, radiation effects
for lethal cancers (bone marrow or lung)
have been studied more than cancers with
good prognoses such as prostate or skin
cancers (Table 1).
The latest MSK risk estimates were
obtained after dividing the workforce
into 480 cohorts that were stratified for
numerous factors including radiation
danger levels for different occupations
and identification of the cancers of tissues
that earlier studies had shown were
exceptionally radiosensitive (so-called
Group A cancers, Table 1).

MSK Estimates
of Relative Risk
A statistical analysis that had several
optimal properties and was designed to
address all objections raised by critics ofear-
lier estimates of RR found definite evidence
of radiation effects for Group A cancers and
demonstrated that they were influenced by
exposure age, cancer latency, and dose
response [Table 8 in Kneale et al. (7)].
ExposureAge
The radiation effect increased progressively
with age, which made the risk for workers
40 years of age over twice as high as the

risk for workers 30 years of age (Table 2,
Figure 1).
Cancer Latency
Intervals between cancer induction and
death were usually measured in decades
but there was a wide range on either side
of the most dangerous intervals i.e., 25
years (Table 3, Figure 2). Therefore, even
a cancer death within 5 years of a radia-
tion exposure has a small chance of being
radiation induced.
Dose Response
The cancer risk per unit dose appeared to
be greater at low- than at high-dose levels
(Table 4, Figure 3). Therefore, although a
dose of 15 rem might be sufficient to dou-
ble the normal risk of developing a Group
A cancer, a 3-fold increase in risk might
require a dose of60 rem.
Calculatons
Tables 5 and 6 show the actual dose
records of two Hanford workers and the
calculations that might indicate that only
one ofthese workers is eligible for compen-
sation. In Tables 5 and 6 the cancer effective
dose for each working year was obtained by
multiplying the actual dose by the appro-
priate age and latency factors; the RR was
obtained by adding the effective doses for

each year to obtain a cumulative dose and
consulting Table 4. For the first worker the
effective dose (38.4 rads) was much higher
than the actual dose (6.6 rads); for the sec-
ond worker it was much lower (0.9 and 7.7
rads). Note that the first worker was older
than the second and died several years after
leaving the Hanford plant.
With any compensation scheme that
meets the normal legal requirement of
more than double the normal cancer risk
(RR> 2.0), the older worker with lung
cancer would qualify for compensation and
the younger worker with intestinal cancer
would not. The fairness of such a scheme
would depend upon the validity of the
MSK model, but both the 1981 and the
1993 analyses of the Hanford data (7,9)
are strongly supportive ofthis model.
Conclusion
Although the primary purpose of film
badge monitoring is to detect excessive
radiation exposure in a timely fashion,
many recognize the value of film badge
data for evaluation of long-term exposure
risks (5-7,9). The data are also useful for
evaluating the effects of long-term expo-
sures in individual workers. For this pur-
pose the age of the individual and the
interval after exposure (latency) also must
be factored into the evaluation. We have
proposed and illustrated an approach that
includes these variables. Such an approach
may facilitate equitable decision-making
for radiation-exposed workers.
