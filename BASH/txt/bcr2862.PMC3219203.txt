Abstract
Introduction: Proteins encoded by Fanconi anemia (FA) and/or breast cancer (BrCa) susceptibility genes cooperate
in a common DNA damage repair signaling pathway. To gain deeper insight into this pathway and its influence on
cancer risk, we searched for novel components through protein physical interaction screens.
Methods: Protein physical interactions were screened using the yeast two-hybrid system. Co-affinity purifications
and endogenous co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to corroborate interactions. Biochemical and
functional assays in human, mouse and Caenorhabditis elegans models were carried out to characterize pathway
components. Thirteen FANCD2-monoubiquitinylation-positive FA cell lines excluded for genetic defects in the
downstream pathway components and 300 familial BrCa patients negative for BRCA1/2 mutations were analyzed
for genetic mutations. Common genetic variants were genotyped in 9,573 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers for
associations with BrCa risk.
Results: A previously identified co-purifying protein with PALB2 was identified, MRG15 (MORF4L1 gene). Results in
human, mouse and C. elegans models delineate molecular and functional relationships with BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51
and RPA1 that suggest a role for MRG15 in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Mrg15-deficient murine
embryonic fibroblasts showed moderate sensitivity to g-irradiation relative to controls and reduced formation of
Rad51 nuclear foci. Examination of mutants of MRG15 and BRCA2 C. elegans orthologs revealed phenocopy by
accumulation of RPA-1 (human RPA1) nuclear foci and aberrant chromosomal compactions in meiotic cells.
However, no alterations or mutations were identified for MRG15/MORF4L1 in unclassified FA patients and BrCa
familial cases. Finally, no significant associations between common MORF4L1 variants and BrCa risk for BRCA1 or
BRCA2 mutation carriers were identified: rs7164529, Ptrend = 0.45 and 0.05, P2df = 0.51 and 0.14, respectively; and
rs10519219, Ptrend = 0.92 and 0.72, P2df = 0.76 and 0.07, respectively.
Conclusions: While the present study expands on the role of MRG15 in the control of genomic stability, weak
associations cannot be ruled out for potential low-penetrance variants at MORF4L1 and BrCa risk among BRCA2
mutation carriers.
Introduction
Genes that when mutated cause Fanconi anemia (FA)
and/or influence breast cancer (BrCa) susceptibility
functionally converge on a homology-directed DNA
damage repair process [1]. That is, 15 FA genes
(FANCs) and genes with high-penetrance, moderate-
penetrance or low-penetrance mutations for BrCa
encode for proteins cooperating in a defined FA/BrCa
signaling pathway [2-6]. Remarkably, germline bi-allelic
and mono-allelic loss-of-function mutations in four of
these genes cause FA and BrCa, respectively: FANCD1/
BRCA2 [7,8], FANCJ/BRIP1 [9-12], FANCN/PALB2
[13-15], and the recently identified FA-like/BrCa
mutated gene FANCO/RAD51C [3,4]. These observa-
tions partially endorse perturbation of the DNA damage
response as fundamental in leading to breast carcino-
genesis. In addition to the main effects on susceptibility,
variation in RAD51 - a gene encoding for a component
of this pathway and paralog of RAD51C - modifies BrCa
risk among BRCA2 but not BRCA1 mutation carriers
[16]. Notably, RAD51 interacts with BRCA1 and BRCA2
[17,18] to regulate double-strand breaks repair by
homologous recombination [19].
While genes with low-penetrance and/or modifier
alleles can be linked to diverse biological processes, the
FA/BrCa pathway is still incomplete [2,20]. To gain
deeper insight into the molecular and functional FA/
BrCa wiring diagram and the fundamental biological
process(es) influencing cancer risk, we screened for
novel protein physical interactions of known pathway
components. Consistent with previous results on protein
complex memberships [21,22], we identified a physical
interaction between PALB2 and MRG15. Results from
the analysis of MRG15/MORF4L1 in unclassified FA
patients and familial BrCa cases did not reveal patholo-
gical alterations; nonetheless, a weak modifier effect
among carriers of BRCA2 mutations cannot be ruled
out.
Materials and methods
Yeast two-hybrid design and screens
Following indications of increased sensitivity in the yeast
two-hybrid (Y2H) system [23,24], we designed multiple
baits of each FA/BrCa pathway protein according to
family domains defined by Pfam [25] and intrinsically
disordered regions predicted by PONDR [26], as well as
full-length ORFs. Proteome-scale Y2H screens were car-
ried out using the mating strategy [27] and two different
cDNA libraries as sources of prey, of human fetal brain
or spleen (ProQuest; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Bait fragments were obtained by RT-PCR using cDNAs
derived from healthy lymphocytes, with the primers

indicated in Additional file 1 and were subsequently
cloned into the Gateway pDONR201 (Invitrogen) vector.
Baits were 5’-sequenced so that they were confirmed,
they did not show changes relative to publicly available
sequence information and they were in-frame. Frag-
ments were then transferred to the pPC97 yeast expres-
sion vector (Invitrogen) to be fused with the DNA-
binding domain of Gal4. Constructs were transformed
into the AH109 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) yeast
strain for screens (Y187 mate strain) using selective
medium lacking histidine and supplemented with 10
mM 3-amino-triazole (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Ger-
many) to test the interaction-dependent transactivation
of the HIS3 reporter. Baits had previously been exam-
ined for self-activation at 3-amino-triazole concentra-
tions in the range 10 to 80 mM. Under these
conditions, >107
transformants were screened for each
bait. Positive colonies were grown in selective medium
for three cycles (10 to 15 days) to avoid unspecific
cDNA contaminants, prior to PCR amplification and
sequence identification of prey [28].
Microarray data analysis
The similarity of expression profiles was evaluated by
calculating Pearson correlation coefficients using nor-
malized (gcRMA) expression levels from the Human
GeneAtlas U133A dataset [29] [Gene Expression Omni-
bus:GSE1133]. Comparisons were made for all possible
microarray probe pairs.
Co-immunoprecipitation and co-affinity purification
assays
For co-affinity purification (co-AP) assays, plasmids (1.5
μg) were transfected into HEK293/HeLa cells in six-well
format using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells
were then cultured for 48 hours and lysates prepared in
buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 to 150
mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM ethylenediamine
tetraacetic acid, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Lysates
were clarified twice by centrifugation at 13,000 × g
before purification of protein complexes using sepharose
beads (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) for 1 hour
at 4°C. Purified complexes and control lysate samples
were resolved in Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gels, then
transferred to Invitrolon PVDF membranes (Invitrogen)
or IMMOBILON PVDF (Millipore Corporation, Biller-
ica, MA, USA), and target proteins were identified by
detection of horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody
complexes with chemiluminescence using the ECL/ECL-
Plus Western Blotting Detection Kit (GE Healthcare) or
the Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) following stan-
dard protocols. In some cases, samples were resolved in
NuPAGE Novex 4 to 12% Bis-Tris or 3 to 8% Tris-Acet-
ate Gels (Invitrogen). GST/GST-importin co-APs were
performed as previously described [30].
For endogenous co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)
assays, cell cultures were washed with PBS and lysed at
0.5 × 107
to 1 × 107
cells/ml in NETN buffers (20 mM
Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and
0.5% NP-40) containing 100 to 350 mM NaCl plus pro-
tease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).
In some assays, supplementary phosphatase (10 to 50
mM NaF) or proteasome (MG132; Sigma-Aldrich) inhi-
bitors were added to the solutions. Lysates were pre-
cleared with protein-A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare),
incubated with antibodies (2.5 to 5 μg) for 2 hours to
overnight at 4°C with rotation, and then with protein-A
beads for 1 hour at 4°C with rotation. Beads were col-
lected by centrifugation and washed four times with
lysis buffer prior to gel analysis.
Survival and iRNA-based assays
For evaluation of survival, 3 × 105
cells were seeded in
duplicate in 60-mm dishes and left to recover for 24
hours. Cultures were then exposed to mitomycin-C or
g-radiation at the indicated doses. Next, 72 hours after
the treatment, cells were rinsed with PBS, harvested by
trypsinization and counted. Survival is reported as the
percentage relative to untreated controls. Each siRNA
(Additional file 2) was transfected for two successive
rounds (24 hours apart) at a final concentration of 20
nM using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 4
days, cultures were treated with mitomycin-C or g-radia-
tion. Stealth siRNA Lo GC (12935-200; Invitrogen) was
used as a negative control.
Immunofluorescence microscopy and antibodies
Cells were grown on glass cover slips and fixed using
standard paraformaldehyde solution. Pre-extraction with
PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 minutes at
room temperature was used in some experiments. Stain-
ing was performed overnight at 4°C using appropriate
primary antibody dilutions. Samples were then washed
three times with 0.02% Tween 20 in PBS, incubated for
30 minutes at room temperature with Alexa fluor-conju-
gated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Invitro-
gen), washed three times with 0.02% Tween 20 in PBS,
and mounted on 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-contain-
ing VECTASHIELD solution (Vector Laboratories,
Peterborough, UK). Images were obtained using a Leica
CTR-6000 microscope (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA).
Purified negative control IgGs of different species were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa
Cruz, CA, USA). Anti-tag antibodies used were anti-HA
(12CA5 and Y11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HIS

TSNAX (3179C2a; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-
USP1 (AP130a; Abgent, San Diego, CA, USA). Second-
ary horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies were pur-
chased from GE Healthcare and Abcam.
Caenorhabditis elegans studies
Worms were cultured according to standard protocols,
maintained on NGM agar seeded with Escherichia Coli
OP50 [35]. The Bristol N2 strain was used as the wild-
type strain. Strains carrying mutations studied here were
provided by the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (Uni-
versity of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA): DW104
brc-2(tm1086) III/hT2[bli-4(e937) let-?(q782) qIs48](I;
III); VC1873: rad-51(ok2218) IV/nT1[qIs51](IV;V); and
XA6226 mrg-1(qa6200)/qC1 dpy-19(e1259) glp-1(q339)
[qIs26]. Gonads from gravid adults were dissected out
with fine-gauge needles to perform a standard immuno-
fluorescence. Primary antibodies were rat anti-RPA-1
(1:500) and rabbit anti-RAD-51 (1:100). Secondary anti-
bodies were anti-rat Alexa 488 and anti-rabbit Alexa
568 (Invitrogen). Gonads were mounted with ProLong®
Gold antifade reagent with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(Invitrogen). The cell-permeable SYTO 12 Green-Fluor-
escent Nucleic Acid Stain (Invitrogen) was used to label
apoptotic cell death.
Study samples, genotyping and statistical analysis
All participants were enrolled under Institutional Review
Boards or ethics committee approval at each participat-
ing center, and gave written informed consent. Research
was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki.
The MORF4L1 genomic sequence was obtained from
the University of California at Santa Cruz Genome
Browser version hg18 and intronic primers were
designed using the web-based program Primer3 [36].
Extracts from 13 unclassified FANCD2 monoubiquitiny-
lation-proficient FA cell lines, without mutations in
FANCJ, FANCD1, FANCN, FANCO, or FANCP, and
including six cases with deficient RAD51 nuclear foci
formation, were examined by immunoblotting using the
anti-MRG15 15C antibody [31-34]. These samples were
also sequenced on all annotated MORF4L1 exons and
exon-intron boundaries using primers shown in Addi-
tional file 3.
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers were enrolled
through 18 centers participating in the CIMBA and fol-
lowing previously detailed criteria [37,38]. The following
individual and clinical data were collected: year of birth,
mutation description, ethnicity, country of residence,
age at last follow-up, age at diagnosis of BrCa or at
ovarian cancer diagnosis, age at bilateral prophylactic
mastectomy, and age at bilateral prophylactic
oophorectomy.
Genotyping was performed at the corresponding cen-
ters using 5’ to 3’ nuclease-based assays (TaqMan;
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), except for
an iPLEX assay carried out at the Queensland Institute
of Medical Research (Brisbane, Australia) and containing
EMBRACE, FCCC, GEORGETOWN, HEBCS, HEBON,
ILUH, kConFab, Mayo Clinic, PBCS, SWE-BRCA and
UPENN carriers. Results of these assays were centralized
and analyzed for quality control as previously described
[37]. Based on these criteria, one study was excluded
from the analysis.
Hazard ratio (HR) estimates were obtained using Cox
regression models under both standard regression analy-
sis and under a weighted cohort approach to allow for
the retrospective study design and the nonrandom sam-
pling of affected and unaffected mutation carriers [39].
Analyses were stratified by birth cohort (<1940, 1940 to
1949, 1950 to 1959 and ≥1960), ethnicity and study cen-
ter. A robust variance estimate was used to account for
familial correlations. Time to diagnosis of BrCa from
birth was modeled by censoring at the first of the fol-
lowing events: bilateral prophylactic mastectomy, BrCa
diagnosis, ovarian cancer diagnosis, death and last date
known to be alive. Subjects were considered affected if
they were censored at BrCa diagnosis and unaffected
otherwise. The weighted cohort approach involves
assigning weights separately to affected and unaffected
individuals such that the weighted observed incidences
in the sample agree with established estimates for muta-
tion carriers [39]. This approach has been shown to
adjust for the bias in the HR estimates resulting from
the ascertainment criteria used, which leads to an over-
sampling of affected women. Weights were assigned
separately for carriers of mutations in BRCA1 and
BRCA2 and by age interval (<25, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35
to 39, 40 to 44, 45 to 49, 50 to 54, 55 to 59, 60 to 64,

65 to 69 and ≥70). P values were derived from the
robust score test.
Results
Protein physical interactions
The Y2H system was used to identify physical interac-
tions for components of the FA/BrCa signaling pathway.
In an initial phase, we screened for interactors of 12 pro-
teins, which included the products of the FANCJ and
FANCN genes (BRIP1 and PALB2, respectively)
[9-11,15], CHEK2 as linked to BrCa risk [40], and known
molecular and/or functional interactors of FA/BrCa pro-
teins (ATR, BLM, ERCC1, ERCC4, H2AFX, RAD51,
TOP3A, TOPBP1 and USP1; see Additional file 1). To
increase interactome coverage, we used specific protein
domains or defined regions as baits, in addition to full-
length ORFs, and screened >107
transformants belonging
to two different cDNA sources (see Materials and meth-
ods). Multiple baits were thus screened for each protein
based on Pfam-based family domain similarities [25] and
on predicted intrinsically disordered regions using the
PONDR algorithm [26]. Intrinsically disordered regions
are defined as lacking a fixed tertiary structure and
appear to be more common in nuclear proteins and
involved in the cell cycle, transcription and signaling reg-
ulation processes [41,42]. A total of 33 baits were
screened for the 12 target proteins (Additional file 1).
Two previously demonstrated and six novel, potential
physical interactions were identified through the Y2H
screens (Additional file 4). Consistent with the physical
interaction between their products, analysis of transcrip-
tomic data identified significant expression correlations
across normal human samples for most gene pairs
(Additional file 5). The known interactions were BLM-
MLH1 [43] and ERCC4-ERCC1 [44], through a pre-
dicted disordered region and a family domain, respec-
tively (Additional file 6). The potential physical
interactions included a previously described protein
complex membership between PALB2 and MRG15 (also
known as the MORF4-like 1 gene product) [21,22]. To
corroborate the Y2H results, we performed co-AP and
co-IP assays, which suggested reliability for four of the
interactions: CHEK2-NFKB1, PALB2-MRG15, TOP3A-
TSNAX and USP1-KPNA1 (Additional file 7). TOP3A
was originally co-purified with, among others, BLM,
FANCA and replication proteins [45]. TSNAX (also
known as translin (TSN)-associated factor X) was pre-
viously found to interact physically with MORF4 family
associated protein 1-like 1 [46], and USP1 and KPNA1
were co-purified [47]. With the exception of MRG15
(see below), however, protein depletion assays did not
show cellular sensitivity to g-irradiation or mitomycin-C
for any of the potential pathway components (siRNAs
detailed in Additional file 2).
MRG15 is a chromo domain-containing protein pre-
sent in histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase com-
plexes [34], and the MRG15 ortholog in Drosophila
melanogaster has been co-purified in histone chaperone
complexes with a known BRCA2 interactor in humans,
EMSY [48]. Consistent with a potential role in DNA
damage repair, EAF3, the MORF family ortholog in Sac-
charomyces cerevisiae, was shown to interact genetically
with radiation-sensitive (RAD) genes [49]. As previously
shown [21,22], MRGX, a close homolog of MRG15, also
co-purified with PALB2 (Additional file 8). Consistent
with the interaction domains delineated by the Y2H
results, a MRG15 mutant lacking the C-terminal leucine
zipper domain but not the N-terminal chromo domain
was unable to interact with PALB2 (Additional file 8).
Similarly, the helix-loop-helix region in MRGX was
necessary for co-purification with PALB2 (Additional
file 8). Together, these results support the identification
of a physical interaction between PALB2 and MRG15,
and probably MRGX.
MRG15 and DNA damage repair
According to the putative role of MRG15 in the repair
of DNA double-strand breaks, murine embryonic fibro-
blasts (MEFs) derived from littermate embryos with the
Morf4l1-/-
genotype showed greater sensitivity (measured
as cellular survival) to g-irradiation than wild-type con-
trols (Figure 1). The level of radiation sensitivity was
moderate when compared with Atm-deficient MEFs
(Figure 1). Milder sensitivity to mitomycin-C of cell cul-
tures depleted of MRG15, relative to BRCA2 and
PALB2, was also previously described [21]. In our study,
however, deficiency of Mrg15 and depletion of MRG15
in MEFs and in HeLa and MCF10A cells, respectively,
did not lead to a statistically significant increase in mito-
mycin-C-induced cell death or to G2/M phase cell cycle
arrest and FANCD2 monoubiquitinylation (Additional
file 9 shows results for HeLa cells). The observed milder
effect and the use of different cell types may explain the
discrepancy regarding mitomycin-C sensitivity when
MRG15/Mrg15 is fully or partially depleted.
Contrary to the results for MRG15/Mrg15, radiation
sensitivity phenotypes were not observed with assays for
MRGX - also consistent with the previous study [21] -
and for the potential novel interactor of TOP3A,
TSNAX (data not shown). In agreement with the known
role of TOP3A in telomere maintenance [50], however,
an EmGFP-tagged TSNAX protein co-localized in speci-
fic nuclear structures with the telomere-binding protein
TRF2 (Additional file 10). The major partner of
TSNAX, TSN, was initially identified as a protein that
binds to breakpoint junctions [51] and with high affinity
to repeat sequences [52]. Although there is no evidence
linking TSN to processes where recombination is

necessary, there is some suggestion of a role in the DNA
damage response [53]. Intriguingly, telomere shortening
has been linked to FA pathology [54-56], and some
FANC products were demonstrated to participate in tel-
omere maintenance [57-59]. These observations lead to
speculation that interactions between TSN-TSNAX-
TOP3A may play a role in DNA damage repair and tel-
omere maintenance by signaling through the FA/BrCa
pathway.
In previous work, MRG15 appeared necessary for the
association of BRCA2/PALB2/RAD51 with chromatin
and the formation of nuclear foci following g-irradiation
[21]. In keeping with these observations, Morf4l1-/-
MEFs showed lower numbers of Rad51 nuclear foci
after g-irradiation - discovered across time points and
using clones or unselected cell cultures (Figure 2a shows
results for clones). On the other hand, Morf4l1-/-
MEFs
showed lower expression levels of Brca1 and Brca2, but
results were variable for Rad51 (Figure 2b) - Palb2 levels
could not be assessed because the antibodies tested did
not cross-react in mouse cell extracts. The result for
Brca2 appeared to disagree with a previous study using
human cell models [22]; however, another study showed
reduction of BRCA2 through transient depletion of
MRG15 but not MRGX [21]. This relationship for
MRG15 could therefore be reminiscent of the role of
PALB2 in stabilizing BRCA2 [60]. Together, these data
suggest the involvement of MRG15 in the repair of
DNA double-strand breaks through relationships with
BRCA2, PALB2 and RAD51.
Caenorhabditis elegans mutants of MRG15 and BRCA2
orthologs
The BRCA2 and RAD51 C. elegans orthologs (named
BRC-2 and RAD-51, respectively) interact physically and
regulate homologous recombination, so that brc-2
mutants fail to locate RAD-51 to sites of double-strand
breaks present in meiosis or induced by DNA damage
agents [61]. The hallmarks of brc-2 mutants in the
germline are therefore lack of RAD-51 foci formation in
parallel with an accumulation of RPA-1 at presumptive
double-strand breaks, chromosomal abnormalities at
diakinesis and, consequently, an increase in apoptotic
corpses [61,62]. C. elegans has an ortholog for the
MORF human protein family (named MRG-1), which,
like its mammalian counterparts, associates with chro-
matin and is required for embryo survival and cell pro-
liferation [63,64]. On the strength of this evidence, the
functional link between BRC-2/BRCA2 and MRG-1/
MRG15 was further investigated by assessing the pheno-
copy between brc-2 and mrg-1 mutants (tm1086 and
qa6200, respectively).
Similar to brc-2 mutants, disruption of mrg-1 was
linked to a remarkable increase in the number of RPA-1
foci in meiotic cells relative to wild-type animals (Figure
3a). While a wild-type animal presented, on average,
three or four RPA-1 foci per nucleus, mrg-1 mutants
commonly exhibited nuclei with more than 10 foci (Fig-
ure 3b). Two different patterns for RPA-1 staining were
observed among mrg-1 mutant germ cell nuclei: one
consisted of discrete foci similar to those observed in
brc-2 mutants (Figure 3a, arrow), while the other
showed more intense and diffuse staining (Figure 3a,
arrowhead). Although RAD-51 staining was mainly
nuclear in mrg-1 mutants - contrary to brc-2 mutants
[61] - it was rather diffuse and often intense when com-
pared with the usual pattern of discrete foci only
observed in wild-type animals (Figure 3a and Additional
file 11). Finally, mrg-1 mutants frequently showed aber-
rant chromosomal compaction (Figure 3a, asterisk) and,
as expected, an increase in cell death revealed by SYTO-
12 staining (Figure 3c). Together, these data further
endorse the involvement of MRG-1/MRG15 in the con-
trol of genomic stability and suggest that perturbation
of its function may activate the nonhomologous end-
joining DNA damage repair process, as proposed for
alteration of BRC-2 [61].
MORF4L1, Fanconi anemia and breast cancer risk
Having identified molecular and functional relationships
for MRG15 in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks,
we next evaluated the existence of alterations or muta-
tions of MRG15/MORF4L1 in FA and BrCa patients.

of protein expression. This negative result included the
analysis of six patient-derived FA cell lines defective for
RAD51 foci (Additional file 12). Sequencing of
MORF4L1 in these lines detected a few base substitu-
tions and single base deletions deeper in the introns,
and only annotated common variants in the exons (data
not shown). Parallel to FA, we hypothesized that germ-
line mutations or common variants in MORF4L1 may
confer moderate/low risk of BrCa and/or modify cancer
risk among BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation carriers.
Direct sequencing of MORF4L1 exons and flanking
sequences in 300 patients with strong familial aggrega-
tion of BrCa but without detected mutations in BRCA1
or BRCA2, and belonging to two populations (United
Kingdom, Institute of Cancer Research; Spain, Catalan
Institute of Oncology), did not reveal pathogenic
changes either. This negative result is consistent with a
recent report in a similar setting by another group [65].
Nevertheless, given the extremely low frequency of
high/moderate-penetrance mutations of other compo-
nents of the FA/BrCa pathway [3,12,14] and the possible
involvement in other cancer types [66], further investi-
gation of MORF4L1 may be warranted.
The public results of the genome-wide association
study conducted by the CGEMS initiative [67] suggest
that common variation at the linkage disequilibrium
block containing MORF4L1 is associated with BrCa risk
(P2df < 0.01) (Figure 4a). Based on this observation, we
genotyped two SNPs in a series of 9,573 BRCA1/2
mutation carriers collected through 18 centers partici-
pating in CIMBA: rs7164529 and rs10519219, with D’ =
1 and r2
= 0.08. After quality control and Hardy-Wein-
berg equilibrium checks, Cox regression analysis
revealed no significant associations between the SNPs
and BrCa risk for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers
(rs7164529, Ptrend = 0.45 and 0.05, P2df = 0.51 and 0.14,
respectively; rs10519219, Ptrend = 0.92 and 0.72, P2df =
0.76 and 0.07, respectively; Table 1). There was some
suggestion of association with increased BrCa risk for
BRCA2 mutation carriers under the recessive model for
rs10519219 (P = 0.033) (Figure 4b and Additional file
13). Under the multiplicative model, there was no evi-
dence of heterogeneity in the HRs of rs7164529 between
studies (P = 0.66 and 0.21 for BRCA1 and BRCA2 muta-
tion carriers, respectively) but some suggestion for
rs10519219 among BRCA2 mutation carriers (P =
0.041). If an effect exists, the HR estimates for BRCA2
mutation carriers due to minor genotypes of rs7164529
or rs10519219 are in the opposite direction to those
obtained in the general population (Table 1). Studying
cancer susceptibility in mouse models has revealed
opposite allele effects across different genetic back-
grounds [68]. In this context, having a potential serial
model of function between BRCA2 and MRG15, the

effect of MORF4L1 alleles on BrCa risk might differ
depending on the genetic/functional status of BRCA2/
BRCA2: that is, wild-type in the general population ver-
sus altered or absent in BRCA2 mutation carriers. On
the other hand, common predisposition alleles differen-
tially associate with BrCa risk among BRCA1 and
BRCA2 mutation carriers [16,37,69], which suggests dif-
ferences in the influence of a given biological process on
carcinogenesis between the two types of carriers.
We performed a number of sensitivity analyses to
investigate the robustness of our results. Inclusion of
prophylactic oophorectomy as a time-dependent covari-
ate did not influence risk estimations (Pregression coefficients
> 0.10). Some suggestion of association was revealed
when prevalent cases, defined as those diagnosed >5
years before recruitment, were excluded from the ana-
lyses: rs7164529 per-allele model, BRCA2 n = 2,803, HR
= 1.09, 95% confidence interval = 1.00 to 1.18, P =
0.048; and rs10519219 recessive model, BRCA2 n =
2,633, HR = 1.78, 95% confidence interval = 1.12 to
2.87, P = 0.027. Finally, data were also analyzed using a
weighted cohort approach [39] to allow for the retro-
spective study design and, in particular, the nonrandom
sampling of affected and unaffected mutation carriers.
This yielded similar results to those shown in Table 1
for the per-allele and two-degrees-of-freedom models
(rs7164529, BRCA1 weighted HR (wHR) = 1.04 to 1.08,
BRCA2 wHR = 1.03 to 1.12; and rs10519219, BRCA1
wHR = 0.98 to 1.08, BRCA2 wHR = 0.95 to 1.59), but

1.62, 95% confidence interval = 0.97 to 2.70, P = 0.062)
(Additional file 13). No evidence of heterogeneity was
observed in any case for the wHRs (P > 0.30).
Discussion
Given the evidence across biological levels and species
models, we hypothesized that perturbation of MRG15
function through genetic mutations or common alleles
might be at the root of some cases of FA and/or BrCa.
The results of our study, in addition to a recent publica-
tion on BrCa [65], indicate that in all probability the
germline mutations in MORF4L1, if any, are not at the
root of FA or BrCa. Next, analysis of common genetic
variation at the MORF4L1 locus in BRCA1 and BRCA2
mutation carriers has not identified significant associa-
tions under the principal models. However, weak asso-
ciations for risk among the latter group under the
additive (rs7164529) and recessive (rs10519219) models
might exist. Notably, in addition to the molecular and
functional data presented, while MRG15 was demon-
strated to co-purify with both BRCA1 and BRCA2, it
only appeared to be necessary for the recruitment of
BRCA2 (and PALB2/RAD51), but not of BRCA1, at
sites of DNA damage [21]. Taken together, these obser-
vations suggest that the potential link between
MORF4L1 and risk of BrCa warrants further assessment
in larger sets of BRCA2 mutations and in additional
case-control studies.
Conclusions
Studies in human, mouse and C. elegans models link
MRG15 to the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, pos-
sibly through molecular and/or functional interactions
with BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51 and RPA1. No pathogenic
alterations of MRG15 or MORF4L1 have been observed
in FA patients unclassified in terms of subtype or in
familial BrCa cases negative for mutations in BRCA1 or
BRCA2. Finally, no significant association with BrCa risk
among BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers has been
revealed for two common genetic variants at the
MORF4L1 locus. Given a potentially weak and specific
effect among BRCA2 mutation carriers, however, analyses
in a larger series may be warranted.

Authors’ contributions
The project was conceived and the experiments and data analyses were
coordinated by JS and MAP. The Y2H design and screens were performed
by GM, CAM, LG-B and MAP. The co-AP/co-IP assays, biochemical and/or cell
biology studies of FA/BrCa pathway components were performed by GM,
CAM, LG-B, HA, FKP, RD and MAP. The studies of MORF4L1/MRG15 in MEFs
and the co-AP assays were performed by ET, OMP-S and KT. The studies of
mitomycin-C and γ-radiation sensitivity, and FANCD2 monoubiquitinylation
were performed by MB, MJR, MC, GH and JS. Statistical analyses were
performed by NB, DC and MAP with the support of LM and ACA. The
studies in C. elegans were performed by MP and JC. MORF4L1 sequencing
was carried out by SS, AR and NR in the United Kingdom, and CL, IB, JBr, JF-
R and MAP in Spain. The study of cell lines from FA patients was performed
by JK, KN and DS. The study of CIMBA carriers was coordinated and
executed by DFE, LM, ACA and GC-T. iPLEX genotyping was performed by
XC and JBee. Classification of BRCA1/2 mutations was performed by SH and
OMS. DNA samples and clinical data of carriers were contributed by: DFE, SP,
MC, CTO, DF, RP, DGE, FL, RE, LI, CC, RD, K-RO, JC, FD, SH, CB, PJM and MP
