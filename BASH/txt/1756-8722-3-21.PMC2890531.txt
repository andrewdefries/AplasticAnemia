Abstract
Background: There has been little literature about leukemia epidemiology in Nanjing in recent years. We aimed to
explore the incidence rate, gender and age distribution of leukemia in Nanjing using the leukemia database of the city.
Results: The average yearly incidence rate of leukemia was 3.68/105 during 2003 - 2007 in Nanjing. There were no
significant difference in gender (x2 = 3.266, p > 0.05) or seasons (x2 = 11.36, p > 0.05). The incidence rate was the highest
in group aged 80~ years (18.64/105). AML accounted for approximately 36.8% of all leukemias.
Conclusions: The incidence rate of leukemia, especially in the aged population, was relatively high in Nanjing.
Leukemia is the major malignant tumor in children. Therefore, more attention should be paid to leukemia in children
and the aged people.
To the Editor
Nanjing, an ancient capital and the second largest city in
southeast China, enjoys a worldwide reputation for its
long history and splendid culture. Little has been
reported regarding leukemia epidemiology of the city in
recent years. The present study was to investigate the leu-
kemia incidence rate in Nanjing during 2003-2007, which
may be of help to further leukemia etiology research.
The leukemia data were collected from all hospitals
which are capable of making a definite diagnosis of leuke-
mia. We diagnosed leukemia by blood test, bone marrow
puncture, histochemical staining and typing and classi-
fied by the "French American British" classification. The
population data were provided by Nanjing Public Secu-
rity Bureau and Nanjing Statistical Yearbook in 2007.
There were 1,095 cases of various types of leukemia,
while the total population in Nanjing during 2003-2007
was 29.7603 million, so the overall average annual inci-
dence rate of leukemia was 3.68/105 and the age-stan-
dardized incidence rate was 3.47/105. The result was
higher than that of the entire nation (2.76/105) [1], but
lower than that in some other cities in China, such as:
Shenyang(4.83/105) [2] and Tianjin during 1981-
2000(4.71/105) [3]. Moreover, compared with the whites'
leukemia incidence rate (12.8/105), it was lower.
Table 1 shows incidence rates of all types of leukemia in
every age group in Nanjing during 2003 to 2007. The leu-
kemia incidence rate in old age groups was generally high,
and reached to the peak in group aged 80~ years(18.64/
105), but this was still lower than the highest rate in She-
nyang-the group aged 75~ years (35.76/105) [2]. Although
the incidence rate of leukemia in children was lower than
that in the old age group, leukemia accounted for a big
proportion in the child malignant tumors [2,4], therefore,
leukemia has become the children's primary malignant
tumor. The possibe explanation was bad internal environ-
ment's stable of hemopoiesis system in children, the
hereditary factors, prenatal exposure to hazard factors of
leukemia (X-ray, diesel oil, chemical fertilizer) and so on
[5]. Other research presumed childhood leukemia was
related with poor immunity and high birth weight [6].

Interestingly, AML accounted for approximately 25% of
all leukemias in adults and 15%-20% in patients age ≤ 15
years in the Western world[7], which were both much
lower than 36.8% in our research. The incidence rates of
all types of leukemia especially non-AML types were
lower in Nanjing.
The composition ratio of different subtypes of AML were:
M2(36.17%), M3(26.60%), M5(11.35%), M4(10.28%),
M1(6.74%), M6(4.96%), M7(2.13%), M0(1.77%), respec-
tively. These were similar to the reports in the literature
[8,9].
By chi-square test, no significant difference was found
between genders (x2 = 3.266, p > 0.05) or among seasons
(x2 = 11.36, p > 0.05). And the 5-year incidence rate is
relatviely stable.
Current study has provided detailed information of the
leukemia epidemiology in Nanjing during the period
2003-2007. Long-term follow-up investigations are
needed for better understanding of characteristics of leu-
kemia in Nanjing, including etiology, survival and risk
indicators, which may lend support to the corresponding
protocols for prevention and intervention.
