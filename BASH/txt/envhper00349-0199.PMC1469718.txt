Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful new technique that allows numerical
chromosome aberrations (aneuploidy) to be detected in interphase cells. In previous studies, FISH
has been used to demonstrate that the benzene metabolites hydroquinone and 1,2,4-benzenetriol
induce aneuploidy of chromosomes 7 and 9 in cultures of human cells. In the present study, we
used an interphase FISH procedure to perform cytogenetic analyses on the blood cells of 43
workers exposed to benzene (median=31 ppm, 8-hr time-weighted average) and 44 matched
controls from Shanghai, China. High benzene exposure (>31 ppm, n=22) increased the
hyperdiploid frequency of chromosome 9 (p<0.01), but lower exposure (<31 ppm, n=21) did
not. Trisomy 9 was the major form of benzene-induced hyperdiploidy. The level of hyperdiploidy
in exposed workers correlated with their urinary phenol level (r=0.58, p<0.0001), a measure of
internal benzene dose. A significant correlation was also found between hyperdiploidy and
decreased absolute lymphocyte count, an indicator of benzene hematotoxicity, in the exposed
group (r=-0.44, p=0.003) but not in controls (r=-0.09, p=0.58). These results show that high
benzene exposure induces aneuploidy of chromosome 9 in nondiseased individuals, with trisomy
being the most prevalent form. They further highlight the usefulness of interphase cytogenetics
and FISH for the rapid and sensitive detection of aneuploidy in exposed human populations.

mostly breaks and gaps, and sister chro-
matid exchanges in lymphocytes of exposed
workers (7-10). These results suggest that
chromosome abnormalities and mitotic
recombination may be the most likely
mechanisms by which benzene induces
genetic alterations that lead to leukemias
in humans.
Previous studies have shown that ben-
zene causes cytogenetic changes in specific
chromosomes, especially of the C-group
chromosomes 6-12 and X (11-14). For
example, trisomy C, an extra chromosome
of the C group, was frequently detected in
bone marrow and blood of several patients
suffering from benzene-induced myeloge-
nous leukemia (12,15,16), myelodysplastic
syndrome, and pancytopenia (14). In one
of these patients, a clonal expansion of
trisomy 9 was observed in all cells exam-
ined (12). A nonclone of trisomy 9 was
also found in another benzene-poisoned
patient (14). The t(9;22) translocation,
known as the Philadelphia chromosome,
was also observed in a case of leukopenia
due to chronic exposure to benzene for
4 years (17).
Rowley et al. (18) speculated that
changes in the C-group genetic material
coupled with a transforming event could
perturb normal hematopoiesis, resulting in
a greater risk for leukemia. Trisomy of
C-group chromosomes has been detected
in myeloproliferative disorders (19) and in
metaplasia with possible leukemia (20).
Therefore, numerical and structural alter-
ations of C-group chromosomes may play
an important role in the leukemogenesis
induced by benzene.
The findings described above were
obtained using conventional cytogenetic
analysis or chromosome-banding tech-
niques. These standard techniques could
only examine a relatively small number of
well-spread metaphase cells. Thus, the
majority of cells that remain in interphase
are excluded from analysis. These tradi-
tional assays are too time consuming to
score a large number of cells, and rare
events may therefore not be detected.
Recently, fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) has made it possible to detect
numerical and structural chromosomal
changes in large numbers of both inter-
phase nuclei and metaphase spreads (21).
This molecular cytogenetic method uses in
situ hybridization with DNA probes

chromosomes (22,23). Aneuploidy is
determined by simply counting the num-
ber of label regions representing a particu-
lar chromosome of interest within the
isolated nucleus.
A FISH procedure was used to test
whether polyphenolic metabolites of ben-
zene induce aneuploidy of chromosome 9
in human cells. Our results showed that
1,2,4-benzenetriol increased the hyper-
diploid frequency of chromosome 9 in the
human myeloid HL60 cell line (24).
Others showed that hydroquinone induced
aneuploidy of chromosome 9 in cultured
human lymphocytes (25). Trisomy 9, not
tetrasomy, accounted for the majority of
the hyperdiploidy induced by these
benzene metabolites.
From these in vitro studies and the early
case reports, two conclusions can be made:
benzene metabolites induce aneuploidy of
chromosome 9 in human cells, and trisomy
9 is detected in patients poisoned with ben-
zene or with benzene-induced leukemia. It
is not known, however, if benzene induces
aneuploidy of chromosome 9 in nondis-
eased individuals. To answer this question,
we have applied interphase FISH technol-
ogy in a biomarker study of an exposed
Chinese population. We demonstrate that
high levels of benzene exposure produce
hyperdiploidy of chromosome 9 in the
lymphocytes ofexposed workers.
Materials and Methods
Subject Enrollment and
Exposure Assessment
Eighty-eight study subjects were enrolled
in Shanghai, China. Blood and urine sam-
ples from 87 ofthese subjects were used for
this study because the blood from one sub-
ject was not cultured successfully. Subject
enrollment has been described in detail ear-
lier (26). Briefly, 44 healthy workers who
were currently exposed occupationally to a
wide range of benzene concentrations but
had minimal exposure to toluene and other
aromatic solvents and no exposure to other
known marrow-toxic chemicals or ionizing
radiation were enrolled. Forty-four con-
trols frequency-matched to the exposed
subjects on age (5-year intervals) and gen-
der were selected from the same geographic
area. These controls had no history of
occupational exposure to benzene or other
chemical carcinogens. Exclusion criteria for
all subjects included history of cancer,
therapeutic radiation, or chemotherapy.
Current benzene exposure for each sub-
ject was monitored by organic vapor pas-
sive dosimetry badges (3M, St. Paul, MN).
Each worker wore the badge for the full
work shift on 5 continuous days prior to
phlebotomy. An 8-hr time-weighted aver-
age (TWA) benzene exposure level, along
with an exposure level to toluene and
xylene, was calculated as the geometric
mean of the five air measurements. Only
trace amounts of other aromatic solvents
were detected in the samples. All exposure
assessment was performed blinded with
respect to aneuploidy detection by FISH.
Personal benzene air levels in these fac-
tories were much higher than had been
expected based on historical area monitor-
ing data. As a direct result of this study,
remedial action was taken at the two work-
places with the highest benzene exposures.
Actions taken included substitution of
toluene for benzene, enclosure of reaction
vessels, and improvement in ventilation.
Urine Collection and Phenol
Measurement
Forty-three of 44 benzene-exposed workers
provided a spot urine sample at the end ofa
work shift or at the end of the high expo-
sure period during their work shift. The
control subjects provided a spot urine sam-
ple during their blood collection. Urine
samples were immediately aliquoted and
frozen on dry ice, and stored at -70°C.
Urinary phenol was measured using a
modification of a previously described
isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass
spectroscopy (GC-MS) assay, which
employed a 13C-label analog of phenol as
the internal standard (27). Concentrations
ofphenol in urine were determined by cali-
brating against a primary standard solution.
Urine samples were diluted with deionized
water (1:1) because of the high levels of
metabolites. We added 100 ll ofeach inter-
nal standard solution and concentrated
HCl into 400 pl diluted urine samples in
vials. The vials were capped and incubated
at 100°C for 60 min, and allowed to cool.
Following extraction, drying, and decanta-
tion, the sample aliquots in ethyl acetate
were combined and evaporated to 200 pl
under nitrogen. The samples were derived
with 100 pl ofbistrimethysily-trifluoraceta-
mide, incubated at 60°C for 30 min, and
analyzed by GC-MS.
Blood Cultures and Slide Preparation
The heparin-anticoagulated whole blood
was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 15% fetal bovine
serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1%
L-glutamine (Gibco, Grand Island, NY),
and 1% phytohemagglutinin-P (Pharmacia,
Piscataway, NJ). The cultures were incu-
bated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 moist atmos-
phere and lymphocytes harvested 72 hr
after initiation. After hypotonic treatment
(0.075 M KCl) for 30 min at 37°C, the
cells were fixed three times with freshly
made Carnoy's solution (methanol:glacial
acetic acid = 3:1). The fixed cells were then
dropped onto prelabeled glass slides,
allowed to air dry, and stored at -20°C
under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization
Detailed procedures for FISH with repeti-
tive DNA probes have been described pre-
viously (24,28). Briefly, the biotinylated
human centromeric probe (classical satel-
lite) specific for chromosome 9 (Oncor,
Gaithersburg, MD) was mixed with soni-
cated salmon sperm carrier DNA in 55%
formamide (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland)
with 10% dextran sulfate. The probe DNA
was denatured at 70°C for 5 min, and cel-
lular DNA was denatured in 70% forma-
mide in 2xSSC (0.3 M sodium chloride
and 0.03 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0) at
72°C for 2 min. The denatured probe of
chromosome 9 was then hybridized with
target DNA overnight at 37°C in a humidi-
fied chamber. The hybridized region can
be detected with fluorescein isothiocya-
nate-conjugated avidin antibody (Vector,
Burlingame, CA) after postwash in 50%
formamide/2xSSC for 3 times at 45°C.
After three washes in phosphate buffer, the
hybridization signal was amplified using a
biotinylated goat antiavidin antibody
(Vector, Burlingame, CA). The red fluores-
cent dye propidium iodide (0.5 jig/ml) in a
mounting medium (Vector, Burlingame,
CA) was used to counterstain DNA. The
hybridization signals were viewed by a
Nikon fluorescence microscope equipped
with epifluorescent illumination and a
IOOx oil immersion lens. A filter for
fluorescein (excitation at 450-490 nm,
dichroic at 510 nm, emission at 520 nm)
was used. The nuclei appeared red with
bright green-yellow spots indicating the
hybridization regions.
Statistical Analyses
Arithmetic mean ± standard deviation
(SD) and median with range are used to
summarize data, which are presented as
number of cells with an aneuploidy event
detected out of 1000 cells scored. The
Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to test
for differences in aneuploidy rates between
exposed subjects, as a single group, and

controls. Subsequent analyses were per-
formed on study subjects divided into
three groups: controls, subjects exposed to
< 31 ppm benzene (the median TWA
exposure level), and subjects exposed to
> 31 ppm benzene. Analysis of covariance
was used to test for group differences in
aneuploidy. Correlation analyses were per-
formed with Pearson's product-moment
correlation. For these analyses, 0.5 was
added to each aneuploidy value (since
some subjects had no detectable events)
and transformed by the natural logarithm
to improve normality.
Variables tested for potential confound-
ing were age, gender, current and lifelong
tobacco use status, current alcohol intake,
and body mass index, a measure of obesity
calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2.
Since results were minimally changed after
including these variables, results are pre-
sented adjusted only for age and gender,
the original matching variables. Two-sided
p-values were calculated throughout: p-val-
ues < 0.05 were considered adequate to
reject the null hypothesis. All statistical
analyses were performed using SAS for per-
sonal computer, version 6.04 (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
Age, smoking, and alcohol use patterns
were similar among the subjects exposed to
benzene and controls (Table 1). The
hyperdiploid frequency (mean ± SD) of
chromosome 9 was 0.007 ± 0.004 in con-
trols (n= 44) and 0.009 ± 0.008 in exposed
workers (n= 43). This difference was not
statistically significant (p= 0.29). There was
a difference, however, by level of exposure.
Because the median exposure level in the
benzene-exposed group was 31 ppm, this
group was divided into two exposure cate-
gories: a lower exposed group, with expo-
sures < 31 ppm (n= 21), and a higher
exposed group, with exposures > 31 ppm
(n= 22). Compared to controls, the hyper-
diploidy ofchromosome 9 was significantly
increased (p = 0.008) in the highly exposed
workers (0.013 ± 0.009) but not in the
lower exposed group (0.006 ± 0.004,
p=0.1) (Figure 1; Table 2). This suggests
that chromosome 9 may only be sensitive
to the aneuploidogenic effects of benzene
at higher exposure levels.
Hyperdiploidy can be separated into
two categories: trisomy and tetrasomy. The
effect of benzene on chromosome 9 was
not statistically significant for trisomy or
tetrasomy (p = 0.38 and 0.75, respec-
tively) in exposed workers compared with

group was separated into two categories, as
described above, a dose-dependent effect
was observed. Trisomy of chromosome 9
was significantly increased (p= 0.02) in the
higher exposed workers (> 31 ppm), and
an increase of borderline significance
(p= 0.05) in tetrasomy 9 was also observed
in this group. No increase in trisomy and
tetrasomy was detected in the < 31 ppm
exposure group (Table 2). Thus, high
benzene exposure induces hyperdiploidy
of chromosome 9 with trisomy being
more prevalent.

Phenol is the principal metabolite of
benzene. Its concentration in the urine of
exposed workers can be used as an index of
internal dose because the urinary level is
highly correlated with external benzene
exposure. Figure 2 shows the strong corre-

for a correlation between hyperdiploidy of
chromosome 9 and absolute lymphocyte
count in both the exposed and control
groups. Hyperdiploidy was significantly
correlated with the lymphocyte count of
the exposed workers (r=-0.44; p= 0.003)
(Figure 3A), but the correlation was not
found in the control group (r= -0.09;
p= 0.58) (Figure 3B). Thus, hyperdiploidy
of chromosome 9 is highly correlated
with both the dose and hematotoxic effect
ofbenzene.
Discussion
The ability ofbenzene to induce aneuploidy
in humans has been a matter of some
debate. Aneuploidy ofspecific chromosomes
has been detected in benzene-poisoned
individuals and in cases ofbenzene-induced
leukemia (1,13). However, most previous
studies of currently exposed workers have
not observed significant increases in aneu-
ploidy levels ( 7,9,29). These previous
studies were limited to examining chromo-
some aberrations in relatively few (25-100)
metaphase spreads by conventional cytoge-
netics. In the current study, we used FISH
technology to examine the ploidy status of
the C-group chromosome 9 in at least 1000
interphase blood cells per subject in 43 ben-
zene-exposed workers and 44 unexposed
controls. Our results demonstrate that ben-
zene exposure increases the hyperdiploidy
frequency of chromosome 9 at exposures
above 31 ppm, but not below this level.
The hyperdiploidy of chromosome 9 was
strongly correlated with measured air levels
of benzene and urinary levels of phenol, a
marker of internal dose. It also correlated
strongly with decreased lymphocyte count
in the exposed workers. Thus, benzene
appears to have a clear dose-dependent
effect on the aneuploidy ofchromosome 9.
In previous studies, it was shown that
metabolites of benzene-induced kineto-
chore-positive micronuclei in human lym-
phocytes (30,31). This suggested a potential
aneuploidogenic effect of hydroquinone
and other benzene metabolites. As a fol-
low-up to these studies, it was shown that
the benzene metabolites hydroquinone and
1,2,4-benzenetriol induced aneuploidy of
chromosome 9 (24,25). These studies
employed interphase FISH technology to
investigate the ploidy status of chromo-
some 9 in interphase nuclei from cultured
human cells. The aneuploidogenic effects
of benzene observed in the present study
are therefore consistent with previous
in vitro findings.
Hyperdiploidy of chromosome 9 has
been observed in two patients with bone
marrow toxicity from benzene (12,14).
Hyperdiploidy of C-group chromosomes
has also been detected in patients with ben-
zene-induced myelogenous leukemia. In
the present study, we have demonstrated
that benzene induces aneuploidy of the
C-group chromosome 9 in nondiseased
individuals. This is the first demonstration
to our knowledge ofa chromosome-specific
aneuploidogenic effect of benzene in
currently exposed humans.
One of the metabolites of benzene,
1,4-benzoquinone, has been shown to be a
potent inhibitor of microtubule assembly
(32,33). The metabolites hydroquinone
and 1,2,4-benzenetriol have also been
shown to produce microtubule disruption,
in addition to aneuploidy, in intact human
cells (24). This is probably the result of
their oxidation to quinones, which then
covalently bind to tubulin. The most likely
mechanism for the benzene-induced aneu-
ploidy observed in this study is therefore
the conversion of benzene to quinonoid
metabolites in the blood and bone marrow,
which bind to and disrupt the microtubules
of the mitotic spindle and cause malseg-
regation of chromosomes at anaphase. Our
findings in exposed people are therefore
consistent with this mechanism of ben-
zene-induced aneuploidy, and we suggest
that chromosome-specific aneuploidy plays
a key role in benzene-induced leukemia.
Finally, our study shows the value of
combining laboratory analyses with care-
fully documented exposures and measures
of internal dose in epidemiologic studies. It
also highlights the usefulness of interphase
cytogenetics and FISH for the rapid and
sensitive detection ofaneuploidy in exposed
human populations. The recent studies
from Scandinavia and Italy (34,35), which
show a strong link between chromosome
aberrations and future cancer risk, especially
hematopoietic malignancy (35), support
the further development and application of
FISH to rapidly detect chromosome aber-
rations in populations exposed to potential
chromosome-damaging agents. Further-
more, by using FISH to characterize a large
number of cells and to selectively study
aberrations of clinical importance, it may
be possible in the future to estimate an
individual's risk for hematologic and per-
haps other cancers. FISH is therefore likely
to have an increasingly important role in
studies ofcancer etiology.
