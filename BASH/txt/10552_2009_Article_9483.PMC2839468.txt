Abstract
Objective To examine the association between exposure
to endotoxins and lung cancer risk by conducting a sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies
of workers in the cotton textile and agricultural industries;
industries known for high exposure levels of endotoxins.
Methods Risk estimates were extracted from studies
published before 2009 that met predeﬁned quality criteria,
including 8 cohort, 1 case–cohort, and 2 case–control
studies of cotton textile industry workers, and 15 cohort
and 2 case–control studies of agricultural workers. Sum-
mary risk estimates were calculated using random effects
meta-analyses. Potential sources of heterogeneity were
explored through subgroup analyses.
Results The summary risk of lung cancer was 0.72 (95%
CI, 0.57–0.90) for textile workers and 0.62 (0.52–0.75) for
agricultural workers. The relative risk of lung cancer was
below 1.0 for most subgroups deﬁned according to sex,
study design, outcome, smoking adjustment, and
geographic area. Two studies provided quantitative esti-
mates of endotoxin exposure and both studies tended to
support a dose–dependent protective effect of endotoxins
on lung cancer risk.
Conclusion Despite several limitations, this meta-analy-
sis based on high-quality studies adds weight to the
hypothesis that occupational exposure to endotoxin in
cotton textile production and agriculture is protective
against lung cancer.

Introduction
Reduced rates of lung cancer have been observed in several
occupational groups who are exposed to high levels of
organic dusts [1–3]. This reduced risk was initially

attributed to inadequate adjustment for risk factors such as
tobacco smoking [4, 5]. However, in 1973, Henderson and
Enterline [1] proposed that endotoxins contaminating the
dust inhaled by cotton textile workers might be responsible
for the observed protective effect. Mastrangelo et al. [2]
extended this proposition to dairy farmers as an explana-
tion of their low mortality from lung cancer.
Endotoxin is a component of the outer membrane of Gram-
negative bacteria and is released during replication and cell
lysis. It is ubiquitous in indoor and outdoor environments. The
highest endotoxin exposures have been measured in agricul-
tural environments and certain occupational settings such as
cotton textile mills [6]. Exposure primarily occurs through
inhalation of airborne endotoxins present in organic dusts
(also termed bioaerosols). Puriﬁed endotoxin is referred to as
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the lipid-A portion, which is
highly conserved across endotoxins originating from diverse
bacterial species, is the biologically active component of
endotoxins. Experimental studies in animalsand a few trialsin
humans have shown that endotoxins can inhibit tumor initia-
tion and growth and that endotoxins (or LPS) stimulate the
production of endogenous antineoplastic mediators [7–9]. It
has been suggested that immunomodulation is the primary
anti-cancer mechanism, although evidence for mechanistic
pathways is limited [10–12].
Previous meta-analyses found reduced lung cancer risks
in studies of workers in the textile industry published
before 1991 [13] and 2000 [3]. Several broad-based
reviews have reported on cancer risks in farmers in the
1990s [14–16]. Unfortunately, few studies which investi-
gated the association between lung cancer and employment
in these industries included endotoxin or dust exposure
measurements. This lack of exposure estimates hinders the
ability to conclusively state that endotoxin is related to a
decreased risk of lung cancer. We endeavored to examine
more thoroughly the evidence on the relationship between
occupational exposure to endotoxins and lung cancer risk,
and to identify possible sources of heterogeneity in the
relationship. We conducted a systematic review and
selected high quality articles based on a priori set criteria
for the meta-analysis. We focused on two industries which
have been shown to involve high levels of endotoxin
exposure—cotton textile manufacture and agriculture—for
which several large scale studies had been published since
the previously published meta-analyses.
Methods
Search strategy
We limited our review to studies of textile industry and
agricultural workers due to the relatively low exposure
levels in other occupational groups potentially exposed to
endotoxins like waste-collection and treatment workers
[17], veterinarians, and workers in paper factories [18], and
due to the limited number of publications investigating
risks of lung cancer in other occupational groups. We
further narrowed our selection to cotton textile mill
workers as there are few studies on lung cancer among
workers in mills of other natural textile ﬁbers (production
of synthetic textiles entails negligible endotoxin
exposures).
We searched the Medline and PubMed databases for all
relevant articles published up to the end of 2008 using
various combinations of the keywords endotoxin, farmers,
agriculture, textile, cotton, lung and cancer. In addition, we
scrutinized the reference lists of identiﬁed papers for
additional relevant publications. If multiple articles were
published on the same cohort, we included the most recent
publication (n = 5 superseded publications [19–24]). We
limited the retrieval to articles from English language peer-
reviewed journals.
Criteria for inclusion and exclusion
Two investigators (I.B., V.L.) extracted information on
the type of exposure assessment or classiﬁcation used in
the analysis; the subjects’ inclusion criteria; the compar-
ison/control group; the statistical methods used; and the
confounders considered in the analysis. We initially
considered the quality components of the Newcastle–
Ottawa Scale [25], a scale designed to assess non-ran-
domized studies for meta-analyses. The scale evaluates
selection of the cohort, exposure assessment, compara-
bility of exposed and non-exposed cohorts, assessment of
outcome, and adequacy of follow-up. We supplemented
the quality assessment criteria based on the framework
presented by Vlaanderen et al. [26], which speciﬁcally
focuses on the quality of exposure assessment applied in
human observational studies.
Proportionate mortality studies (PMR) were excluded
(n = 12 [27–38]) as their results depend on the proportions
of death from different causes [39]. Case–control studies
that used cancer or respiratory disease patients as com-
parison groups were also excluded (n = 10 [40–49]) as
such comparison is potentially biased [50]. Finally, studies
that insufﬁciently described subject selection and statistical
procedures were excluded (n = 1 [51]).
Data extraction
The risk estimates derived from the model including the
largest number of covariates and their associated 95%
conﬁdence intervals (CI) were extracted. Among the
524 Cancer Causes Control (2010) 21:523–555
123
studies included in the meta-analysis, risk estimates were
expressed as standardized mortality ratios (SMR), stan-
dardized incidence ratios (SIR), relative risks (RR), and
hazard ratios (HR) in the cohort and case–cohort studies,
and as odds ratios (OR) in the case–control studies. If a
study reported multiple estimates for independent sub-
populations, for instance according to job classiﬁcation,
duration of exposure categories, or gender, these were
reported in ‘‘Appendix 1’’. If a cohort study did not report
an overall risk estimate, estimates were combined into one
risk estimate using the inverse of the variance as weight
(Table 1). If subject groups overlapped within a study, the
most inclusive estimate was used. Sex-speciﬁc estimates
were also extracted. A 95% CI was calculated using
Fisher’s exact method for those studies that did not report a
CI [52]. Standard errors (SE) were derived from 95% CIs
by taking the natural logs of the risk ratio and limits of the
CI, calculating the CI legs, and applying the z-distribution
standard deviate to the averaged CI legs.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with the ‘‘metan’’ and
‘‘metabias’’ commands in STATA, version 10.1 (STATA
Corporation, College Station, TX). The data entered into
this statistical package were the natural log-transformed
risk ratios and associated SEs. The coefﬁcient of incon-
sistency (I2
) was applied to assess heterogeneity between
studies [53]. I2
is an estimate of the percentage of total
variation in study estimates due to heterogeneity rather
than chance, and is considered substantial if it exceeds
50%. We deemed the random effects assumptions to be
most appropriate for this set of heterogeneous studies, and
therefore present only these results. Random effects models
[54] were applied to calculate the (reverse transformed)
pooled risk ratios and associated 95% CIs, and z scores of
all studies in each occupational group; textile and
agricultural.
We performed subgroup analyses to assess whether any
observed between-study heterogeneity was due to study
characteristics or differences in quality. Heterogeneity
between subgroups was tested using the PROC MIXED
procedure with maximum likelihood estimation, SAS 9.1
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), and was considered sig-
niﬁcant if the p value of the type 3 F-test was below 0.1.
We refrained from assigning and weighting studies based
on quality scores, as this can produce biased pooled esti-
mates [55]. The subgroups deﬁned a priori were, newer
versus older studies, study design, mortality versus mor-
bidity outcome, adjustment for smoking, geographic area,
and sex. Too few studies stratiﬁed results by job title within
the cotton industry or by farm type to perform subgroup
analyses for these variables.
Publication bias was assessed by constructing funnel
plots of the log risk ratio versus the SE of the log risk ratio
[56], although we acknowledge the limitations of this
method [57]. To supplement the funnel plot approach, the
adjusted rank correlation method suggested by Begg and
Mazumdar [58] and the regression asymmetry test pro-
posed by Egger et al. [59] were applied.
Results
Characteristics of studies analyzed
Eight cohort [1, 60–66], 1 case–cohort [67], and 2 case–
control [68, 69] studies in cotton textile industry workers,
along with 15 cohort [2, 70–83] and 2 case–control [84, 85]
studies in agricultural populations fulﬁlled the quality
assessment criteria and were included in the meta-analysis.
Tables 1 and 2 summarize characteristics of the studies
included in the present meta-analysis; characteristics of all
studies considered for inclusion, and application of the
inclusion criteria are further elaborated in the ‘‘Appendices
1 and 2’’, respectively.
Both an SMR and SIR analysis were reported for the
same cohort of Icelandic farmers [81, 86]; only the latter
estimate, published more recently, was included in the
meta-analysis. Two studies reported on the Agricultural
Health Study in the same year [80, 87]. The SIR from
Alavanja et al. [80], rather than the SMR from Blair et al.
[87], was included as the study had a longer follow-up and
is based on cancer incidence rather than cancer mortality.
This study was designed to investigate the risks associated
with pesticide exposure, but was nevertheless included as
close to 90% of subjects were farmers. We further
restricted our analysis to the SIR reported for private
applicators, who were almost exclusively farmers.
The numbers of lung cancer cases captured by these
studies were 1,217 and 6,216 within the 11 textile industry
studies and 17 agricultural industry studies, respectively.
Quantitative data synthesis and heterogeneity
Tables 3 and 4 present the summary and subgroup risk
estimates for cotton textile and agriculture workers,
respectively. The summary risk (95% CI) of lung cancer
was 0.72 (0.57–0.90) in the cotton textile industry and 0.62
(0.52–0.75) in the agricultural industry. Both occupational

groups had reduced risks of lung cancer, as is presented
graphically in Fig. 1.
The textile industry studies displayed considerable het-
erogeneity; the I2
was greater than 69% in most subgroups
(Table 3). The magnitude of the reduction in risk was
greater for the studies from China and the USA than from
Europe and greater than the one estimate from Australia
(RR (95% CI) of 0.58 (0.40–0.85), 0.54 (0.32–0.92), 0.91
(0.80–1.03), and 1.06 (0.19–5.97), respectively). Textile
industry studies that adjusted for smoking yielded a lower
summary risk, 0.58 (0.40–0.85) (n = 3), than those that did
not adjust for smoking, 0.79 (0.61–1.03) (n = 8), a dif-
ference that was of borderline statistical signiﬁcance. The
summary RR for cohort studies was 0.78 (0.62–0.98), and
for case–control studies, 0.53 (0.31–0.92).
The risk estimates from agricultural studies exhibited
even more heterogeneity than the textile industry studies,
with an I2
of greater than 82% for all subgroups with more
than three studies (Table 4). Studies that adjusted for
smoking (n = 3) had a summary RR of 1.19 (0.94–1.50)
versus 0.55 (0.45–0.67) for the studies that did not. The
two case–control studies yielded 1.32 (1.00–1.74), and the
cohort studies had a lower summary RR (n = 15) of 0.57
(0.47–0.69). The meta-estimates of risk from the studies in
Europe and the USA were similar, and signiﬁcantly lower
than the one estimate from China (0.60 (0.48–0.75), 0.59
(0.41–0.86), 1.60 (0.99–2.58), respectively).
In both textile industry and agricultural studies, meta-
risk estimates were lower in earlier published studies, and
in studies reporting morbidity versus mortality outcomes,
although these differences were not statistically signiﬁcant.
The sex-speciﬁc meta-risk estimates did not differ in the
textile industry cohorts, but a non-signiﬁcant lower meta-
risk estimate was found for female when compared with
male agricultural workers.
Publication bias
The graphical funnel plots appeared symmetrical for
studies from both occupational groups (Fig. 2). There was
little evidence of publication bias among either textile
industry or agricultural studies, according to Begg and
Mazumdar’s test and Egger’s test (p [ 0.20).
Discussion
This meta-analysis substantiates the available evidence of a
reduced risk of developing lung cancer among people
occupationally exposed to organic dusts commonly asso-
ciated with high levels of endotoxin. The apparent pro-
tective effect of endotoxin exposure on lung cancer risk has

previously been postulated to result from healthy worker
selection effect, inadequate adjustment for important con-
founders such as exposure to tobacco smoke, and/or inad-
equate comparison groups [4, 5]. Exploring the inﬂuence of
several variables via subgroup analysis revealed that results
were overall robust, and consistently indicated a reduced
risk in both cotton textile mill workers and farmers,
occupations known to involve high endotoxin exposure
[88, 89]. In addition, the current meta-analysis illuminates
sources of heterogeneity in this relationship which would
need to be clariﬁed in future studies on this topic.
Mastrangelo et al. [3] pooled cancer risks associated
with working in a cotton textile factory from eight studies
published up to 1999 [1, 42, 60, 62, 66, 68], and calculated
a reduced risk for lung cancer of 0.87, 95% CI 0.81–0.93.
The CI is narrower than the one presented in this study,
probably because Mastrangelo et al. employed a ﬁxed
effect model. Given the large heterogeneity in study results
observed, a random effects model seemed more appropriate
at least for our analyses. For comparison purposes, apply-
ing a ﬁxed effects model resulted in the meta-risk estimate
of 0.69, 95% CI 0.63–0.75 for textile industry studies. Su
et al. [13] pooled 5 SMRs from four cohorts also included
in the current meta-analysis [1, 60, 61, 66] and reported a
meta-SMR (95% CI) from presumably a ﬁxed effect meta-
analysis of 0.60 (0.39–0.73) for male textile workers and
0.89 (0.40–1.38) for female textile workers. In contrast
with Su et al., we did not ﬁnd an appreciable difference
between female and male meta-risk estimates. This is
possibly explained by our inclusion of the results from the
large cohort of Shanghai female textile workers and several
other recent studies.
A meta-analysis of cancers in farmers by Acquavella
et al. [15] reported a summary lung cancer RR (95% CI) of
0.65 (0.58–0.73) for 29 studies (including 11 PMR studies
excluded from the current analysis) pooled in a random
effects model. This is similar to the result of the current
meta-analysis. Davis et al. [16] added observed and
expected cases of lung cancer from 24 studies published
prior to 1991 and reported a combined relative risk (95%
CI) of 0.66 (0.64–0.67) for farmers. We excluded some of
the studies as they were PMRs, studies that employed other
cancer patients as controls, or reports not published in peer-
reviewed journals. As such, our meta-analysis is based
solely on studies that met predeﬁned quality control crite-
ria. The evidence from currently available studies is
insufﬁcient to draw a deﬁnite conclusion about a causal
association between endotoxin exposure and lung cancer
risk. Few of the studies assigned quantitative estimates of
exposure to the subjects or grouped subjects based on
estimated categories of exposure, hindering meaningful
dose–response analyses in this meta-analysis. Notably,
however, there was evidence of a dose–response relation-
ship in the two studies that did derive estimates of expo-
sure. The study on Shanghai textile workers modelled and
assigned endotoxin exposure to cases and controls and
found an inverse dose–response relationship between
endotoxin levels and lung cancer [67]. In a cohort of
Lithuanian textile workers, lung cancer risk decreased for
both males and females with increasing quartiles of cotton
textile dust cumulative exposure [64].
In the cotton textile industry, airborne concentrations of
endotoxin are higher in the early stages of cotton pro-
cessing—the opening and carding operations—compared
with later processes such as spinning and weaving [90, 91].
Of the studies that met the inclusion criteria, only three
stratiﬁed by job title [62, 65, 68]. In a cohort of Italian
cotton mill workers, Mastrangelo et al. [65] reported the
greatest reduction in lung cancer SMRs for those workers
in carding jobs, which presumably had the highest endo-
toxin exposure levels, and for those with the longest
duration of employment. In the studies that stratiﬁed by job
task, those workers who did other tasks (such as adminis-
tration, packaging or maintenance) had higher lung cancer
risks than those with job tasks likely to involve higher
endotoxin exposures, such as preparers, spinners, and
weavers [60, 62, 68]. A study on cotton textile workers in
Lithuania also found that longer duration of employment
([10 years) and increasing exposure levels were associated
with greater reductions in lung cancer risk in men, but
these patterns were not observed in the female workers
[64]. Most studies that investigated lung cancer patterns by
duration of employment among both cotton textile and
agricultural workers found deﬁcits associated with
increased years of employment [1, 64, 66, 69, 82], although
several studies did not ﬁnd this [60, 68]. Even though no
quantitative information is available in most evaluated
studies, results based on proxies of exposure intensity and
duration seem in general to corroborate a dose–dependent
effect.
Heterogeneity of the observed protective effect among
textile studies may also be explained by factors related to
exposure intensity such as the origin of the cotton, which is
known to inﬂuence bale moisture and thus endotoxin levels
[92]. This might explain the observed differences in the
protective effect between China and the US and Europe.
Endotoxin concentrations, expressed as Endotoxin Units
per cubic meter of air (EU/m3
) or per milligram of dust
(EU/mg), have been measured with the Limulus amebocyte
lysate (LAL) assay, albeit with inter-laboratory variation of

up to one order of magnitude. Endotoxin levels generally
range from 10 to 10,000 EU/m3
in the textile industry. As a
precursory step in the exposure modeling for the Shanghai
cohort, Astrakianakis et al. [88] combined data from ﬁve
surveys, and showed that GM endotoxin levels ranged from
approximately 60 EU/m3
near the spinning process to
3,600 EU/m3
near the carding process. Endotoxin levels
generally decrease during the processing steps of opening,
carding, drawing, combing, spinning, and weaving, as
impurities are removed to produce a clean product. Median
endotoxin concentrations in three Shanghai textile mills
were 1,281 EU/m3
and 2,227 EU/m3
in samples collected
from 14 areas and 41 personal samplers, respectively [93].
Other studies have reported geometric mean endotoxin
values of 131 to 1,637 EU/m3
in four mills in Quebec,
Canada [94]; a median level of 450 EU/m3
in a German
cotton mill [95]; and a mean that ranged from 111.1 to
156.7 ng/m3
over 3 years in a cotton textile plant in Tai-
wan [96]. A study with 572 personal dust samples from
workers in three Turkish cotton mills observed median
levels of 2,135 EU/m3
for the open and card attendants,
5,857 EU/m3
for the waste room operatives, and much
lower levels of 26–407 EU/m3
for the other occupational
groups [97]. Comparisons of exposure levels between these
studies should be made with caution as high inter-labora-
tory variation is known to exist. However, generally they
are supportive of higher endotoxin exposure levels in the
early stages of cotton processing.
An argument supporting a role for endotoxin in
decreasing lung cancer risk is that lung cancer deﬁcits have
not been consistently observed in other (non-cotton) types
of mills, in which exposure to endotoxin is lower. In the
large cohort of Shanghai textile workers, lung cancer
mortality was lowest in workers from the cotton textile
spinning, weaving and knitting sector, versus the wool,
silk, synthetic, mixed ﬁber textile sectors [21]. One study
investigating lung cancer in a synthetic ﬁber mill found that
lung cancer mortality was increased in workers exposed to

increasing levels of dust [98]. Endotoxin levels are minimal
in synthetic textile dusts, although levels slightly elevated
compared to background levels (\5 EU/m3
) have been
documented in some mills due to contamination of
humidiﬁcation and lubricant mist systems [99]. Consider-
ing that covariate risk factors are unlikely to differ sub-
stantially between synthetic and cotton mills, the ﬁnding
that lung cancer rates are lower in cotton versus synthetic
mill workers is compelling evidence for a protective effect
of endotoxin; however, these ﬁndings should be conﬁrmed
with further research.
It is possible that earlier cohorts exhibited greater deﬁ-
cits in lung cancer than more recent cohorts due to higher
past exposures. While endotoxin and dust levels are only
moderately correlated in cotton mills (r = 0.49, p \ 0.01)
[90], measures to control workers’ exposure to dust, such
as improved ventilation and automation of processing, are
likely to have resulted in lower cumulative dust and
endotoxin exposures in more recent cohorts.
Determinants of endotoxin levels, such as process,
sources, ventilation, and moisture, likely vary more
between different agricultural settings than between cotton
mills. Using a standardized protocol, Spaan et al. [89]
reported a geometric mean (range) of 2,700 (96–
41,200) EU/m3
for grain and legume primary production
(n = 15), and 1,190 (73–19,500) EU/m3
at primary pro-
duction animal farms (n = 377). High endotoxin levels
have been measured during machine harvesting of certain
crops. However, cumulative annual endotoxin levels are
likely to be higher with livestock than crop farming due to
the seasonal nature of the latter. Two agriculture studies
from Italy and Finland included in the present meta-
analysis, that stratiﬁed by production type, found that dairy
farmers had lower risks of lung cancer than crop farmers,
as did the Finnish male farmers with poultry and pigs
[2, 78]. Furthermore, farmers who switched from dairy to
crop farming increased their lung cancer risk [78].
Although there are indications among both the textile
workers and farmers of a possible dose–response relation
between endotoxin exposure and reduced lung cancer risk,
this evidence is still rather weak.
Smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer. Pooling
risk estimates based on whether they were adjusted for
smoking yielded different results for the textile industry
and agricultural studies; the adjusted meta-RR was lower
for textile industry studies, whereas the opposite pattern
was observed in the agricultural studies, although this
difference was non-signiﬁcant in the textile industry and
for each industry, there were only three studies which
adjusted for smoking. Two of the three studies that adjusted
for smoking in both industries were case–control studies,
and the differences in smoking adjusted and unadjusted
meta-risk estimates paralleled the differences between
cohort and case–control studies. It is thus not possible to
state whether factors related to the study design or the
adjustment for smoking most inﬂuenced the overall risks. It
is known that in US populations, farmers have lower rates
of smoking than the general population [80]. Assuming this
pattern holds in populations outside the US, unadjusted risk
estimates with general population controls would over-
estimate any protective effect of endotoxin exposure.
However, there is some evidence from studies that present
both unadjusted and adjusted risk estimates that upon
adjustment for smoking, the protective effect associated
with working as a farmer did not disappear [82, 84, 85].
A limitation of this meta-analysis is the fact that most of
the cohort studies are based on administrative data, such as
registries, and thus often lack information on risk factors
and estimates of endotoxin exposure, and as such working
in the cotton textile or agricultural industries was used as

proxies of exposure. Studies may suffer from residual
confounding from factors such as lifestyle (e.g., diet,
physical activity) and/or other occupational exposures;
however, some studies have shown that adjustment for risk
factors such as smoking does not substantially change
effect estimates [100]. Conversely, non-differential expo-
sure classiﬁcation may have attenuated the effect estimates.
The studies are highly heterogeneous, and populations
differ in baseline risk, lifestyle factors and contrast in
exposure. The validity of combining and comparing risk
estimates from observational studies to obtain a more
precise meta-risk estimate is disputed [101], although it
should be noted that synthesizing evidence from observa-
tional studies is also an issue in non-meta-analytic reviews.
A counter argument is that heterogeneity can be used to
attempt to discern which factors inﬂuence risk, and that
consistency from ﬁndings from heterogeneous studies can
justify the generalizability of meta-analysis results [102,
103]. We did not identify any obvious sources of hetero-
geneity, or ﬁnd convincing evidence that one study char-
acteristic variable contributed more to heterogeneity of the
meta-risk estimates than the others as there was clustering
of the variables we examined. The subgroup meta-analyses
demonstrated that the protective relation of working
in industries with high endotoxin levels on lung cancer
is robust upon consideration of important study
characteristics.
Endotoxin exposure is possibly beneﬁcial with respect
to reducing lung cancer risk. However, it should be noted
that studies indicate that acute exposure to cotton dust can
cause chest tightness, organic dust toxic syndrome and
byssinosis, and long-term exposure is associated with
accelerated decline in lung function and chronic respiratory
disease [104–106]. The potential protective effect of
endotoxin is relevant in understanding the etiology of lung
cancer, and perhaps with respect to developing anti-
carcinogenic therapeutics [107]. The lipid-A portion of
endotoxin has been found to suppress tumor growth in
animal models [10]. Explanations and evidence for plau-
sible mechanistic pathways is limited. It seems that
removing exposure—when farmers quit farming, or switch
to a farming type with purportedly lower endotoxin expo-
sures—causes deﬁcits in lung cancer risk to disappear over
time [78, 82]. It is unclear whether current exposure is
protective, which intensity of exposure is relevant, and
whether the protective effect diminishes with time elapsed
since last exposure to endotoxins.
This meta-analysis of studies of two dissimilar occupa-
tional groups, agricultural and textile workers, despite
several limitations, adds weight to previous evidence that
exposure to endotoxin-contaminated organic dusts may
lead to a reduced risk of developing lung cancer. Future
research should investigate the dose–response relationship
between endotoxin exposure and risk of lung cancer and
focus on possible sources of heterogeneity in this relation.
Quantifying exposures to organic dusts, endotoxin, and
concurrent exposure to other biologically active agents
may help solve the mechanistic pathways of the observed
protective effect.
