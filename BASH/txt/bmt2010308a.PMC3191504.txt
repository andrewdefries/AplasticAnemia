The optimal dose of in vivo-administrated alemtuzumab in
the allogeneic transplantation setting has not been deﬁned.
We report our experience on 37 patients with high-risk
diseases, mainly acute leukemia (AML 23, ALL 10
patients), who underwent sibling (49%) or unrelated
(51%) PBSCT (35 patients), and received a total dose
of only 10–20 mg Campath-1H as part of the conditioning,
and post-transplant CYA without MTX. The neutrophil
and especially the platelet engraftment were rapid. There
were only two grade III–IV acute GvHD cases, which
occurred in unrelated transplants in the Campath-10
cohort. Chronic GvHD developed in six cases (17%) and
was limited to skin in ﬁve of them. After a median follow-
up of 371 days (59–1191), 70% patients are alive and in
CR (Karnofsky 100%), and 11 died (TRM n ¼ 6, relapse
n ¼ 5). From the ﬁve patients relapsed, three were at
advanced stage at transplant and four underwent sibling
HCT with the higher (20 mg) alemtuzumab dose. With
the 10 mg alemtuzumab schedule (5 mg/day at days À2
and À1) we achieve at day of transplantation low but
still lymphotoxic alemtuzumab serum concentrations
(176 ng/mL), whereas levels declined fast thereafter, and
at engraftment nearly no Campath antibody remained in
the patient’s serum.

Introduction
The optimal dose and schedule of in vivo-administered
humanized Campath-1H (alemtuzumab) in the allo-SCT
setting has not been deﬁned. A total dose of 100 mg
alemtuzumab divided over 5 days before transplant was
found to be highly efﬁcient in reducing GvHD, however
with the cost of impaired immune reconstitution, increased
infections and increased relapse rates.1,2
Further studies
have shown that 50 mg alemtuzumab is adequate for
preventing GvHD when combined with CsA/MTX.3,4
Recently, two single-center studies in Italy and Germany
demonstrated that the total alemtuzumab dose can be
reduced to 10–20 mg in reduced intensity conditioning allo-
SCT for lymphoma5
or in elderly patients with AML.6
However, experience on the use of lower doses alemtuzu-
mab, especially in the context of myeloablative transplan-
tation for acute leukemia is sparse and pharmacokinetics
are lacking.
With this background, we started a prospective observa-
tional study in Patras/Greece aiming to evaluate the
feasibility and pharmacokinetics of very low-dose alemtu-
zumab in allo-SCT. Here, we report our experience in 37
patients with high-risk diseases, mainly acute leukemia,
who underwent sibling or unrelated PBSCT and received
before transplant 10–20 mg alemtuzumab and after trans-
plant CsA without MTX as GvHD prophylaxis. Furthermore,
we measured serum alemtuzumab levels and report the unique
pharmacokinetics of the 10mg alemtuzumab schedule.
Patients and methods
Overview of the study protocol
The protocol was reviewed and approved by the local
institutional review board (Nr. 344/04.08.06) and institu-
tional ethics committee (Nr. 525/07.09.06) and all patients
gave written informed consent. Patients received a uniform
GvHD prophylaxis with 10–20 mg alemtuzumab (Mab-
Campath, Genzyme Europe B.V., Naarden, The Netherlands)
and post-transplant CsA without MTX. CsA tapering
started at day þ 50. High-risk patients were allowed to
receive prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI).
The ﬁrst 10 patients received a total dose of 20 mg
alemtuzumab (10 mg/day at days À2 and À1), after
prednisolone and dimetindene premedication. According
to the protocol, engraftment kinetics, occurrence of acute
GvHD4II and TRM were assessed in real time, and de-
escalation of alemtuzumab was performed if p4 patients
experienced severe side-effects. Therefore, the next six
patients received 15 mg alemtuzumab, and thereafter
patients received a total dose of 10 mg alemtuzumab
(5 mg/day at days À2 and À1). Three patients transplanted

during the last time frame received 20 mg alemtuzumab
because of low risk of relapse (aplastic anemia, paroxysmal
nocturnal hemoglobinuria) or because of CML with high
Gratwohl/EBMT score (6/7). Although this was not a dose-
ﬁnding study, we focused on patients who received the
lower 10 mg dose, and therefore besides presenting the
clinical results of the entire patient population, we also
show separately our observations of the 18 patients who
received the lower dose (Campath-10 cohort) and of the 19
patients who received 20 or 15 mg alemtuzumab (Campath-
20/15 cohort).
Conditioning regimen, donors, grafts and supportive care
Patients with AML received chemotherapy based- and
those with ALL TBI based-myeloablative conditioning.
Patients over 55 years of age or patients with severe
comorbidities (HCT-speciﬁc comorbidity index X3) re-
ceived a ﬂudarabine-based reduced toxicity regimen, as
indicated. Donors were HLA-identical siblings or unrelated
with at least seven out of eight (A, B, C and DRB1) HLA
allele match. Patients were managed in laminar airﬂow
rooms and received leukodepleted and irradiated blood
products, and standard nursing and supportive care. CMV
reactivation screening was done weekly by quantitative
CMV-PCR. Chimerism analyses were carried out by PCR
of informative microsatellite markers, as previously
described in detail.7
Deﬁnitions and statistical analysis
Data were evaluated as of April 2010. The day of
engraftment was deﬁned as the ﬁrst of three consecutive
days with leucocytes41 Â 109
cells/L. Platelet recovery was
deﬁned as a platelet count over 20 Â 109
cells/L without
transfusion. Acute and chronic GvHD were staged and
graded according to consensus criteria. The severity of
chronic GvHD was assessed according to functional
impairment and response to ﬁrst-line therapy as mild,
moderate or severe.8
Post-DLI GVHD is deﬁned as the
onset of GvHD after the delivery of DLI. OS was measured
until death due to any cause, and PFS until disease
progression or death due to any cause. Relapse and TRM
were considered to be competing risks. Survival curves were
generated by the Kaplan–Meier method with Graph-Pad-
PrismTM software (La Jolla, CA, USA).
Alemtuzumab serum levels by a sensitive ELISA
Frozen serum samples were shipped on dry ice to
BioAnaLab Ltd, Oxford, UK. Serum levels of alemtuzu-
mab were measured by a sensitive ELISA assay developed
at BioAnaLab (limit of detection 31.25 ng/mL) and results
were the mean of duplicate analyses with a precision between
duplicates o30%. Brieﬂy, the Campath antigen, CD52 fusion
protein (TFYO.CAMG2A.A6.1F2) is absorbed onto a
microtitre plate at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL (100 mL/
well). Following blocking with 2% (w/v) BSA, test samples,
calibration standards and quality control samples are
applied. Following incubation and washing to remove
any nonspeciﬁc binding, the bound Campath is detected
using a monoclonal mouse anti-human IgG1-HRP con-
jugate. Visualization of the binding is achieved using TMB
as the assay substrate. After stopping the reaction with 5%
(v/v) HCl, the absorbance is measured at 450 nm with
background correction at 54 nm. The blank and back-
ground-corrected absorbances are plotted against the log of
the Campath concentration in the calibration standards,
and the calibration curve is ﬁtted using a 4-parameter
logistic model. The concentration of quality control samples
and unknown samples is determined from the blank and
background-corrected absorbance values and the calibra-
tion curve parameters. The result was the mean of duplicate
analyses with a precision between duplicates o30%.
Results
Engraftment, infections and TRM
Characteristics of the 37 consecutive, mostly leukemia
patients, are shown in Table 1. At transplant, 35% of the
patients had advanced disease (4CR-1), whereas 16%
patients were transplanted with active myeloid disease. The
graft source was PBSC in all, except two patients.
Alemtuzumab was well tolerated. The median time to
recover leukocyte counts 41000 Â 109
cells/L was 14 days
(range 10–21), and the median time to achieve untransfused
platelets above 20 Â 109
cells/L was 12 days (7–29) and
above 50 Â 109
cells/L was 13 days (10–95). Seven patients
revealed low percentage (o10%) T-cell restricted mixed
chimerism at median day þ 100 (78–149), which all
converted to full-donor chimerism after CsA was with-
drawn or with DLI. The reconstitution of T-cell subsets is
shown in Figure 1. A median absolute CD4 count, higher
than 200 cells/mL, was reached at 9 months after trans-
plantation. CMV reactivations occurred frequently and
were managed successfully with preemptive antiviral therapy.
Severe early- and late-opportunistic infections were: HHV-6
infection on day þ 58, pneumonitis after heroin inhala-
tion on day þ 305, HBV reactivation on day þ 581, H1N1
infection on day þ 304 and CNS toxoplasmosis on
day þ 61. The low incidence of an early- or late-severe
opportunistic infection is reﬂected to the low day À100
TRM (3%) and 1-year TRM (14%). Causes of nonrelapse
deaths were: CNS hemorrhage (n ¼ 1), infections in the
context of acute GvHD (n ¼ 2) and post-DLI GvHD
related (n ¼ 3).
GvHD
We did not observe any grade II or higher acute GvHD
after sibling transplantation (Table 1). Two grade II (5%)
and two grade III (5%) acute GvHD cases occurred in
matched unrelated donor recipients of the Campath-10
cohort. It must be noted that both grade III acute GvHD
patients had active disease at transplant and CsA was
discontinued early (day þ 30, day þ 95). Chronic GvHD
developed in only six cases (cumulative incidence 17%) and
was limited to skin in ﬁve of them. The single case of severe
GvHD beyond day þ 100 observed in an HbsAg þ patient/
donor pair (fulminant acute-like liver GvHD on day þ 143).
The low-chronic GvHD incidence is reﬂected in the very
good performance status of the 26 patients who are alive
(median Karnofsky 100%, 80–100).

DLI
Three patients received DLI’s for relapse but none of them
responded. A total of 10 recipients received prophylactic
DLI at a median of 159 days after allo-SCT (78–426), 5
because of mixed chimerism and 5 preemptive. Notably, six
of them (four sibling, two matched unrelated donor)
developed GvHD. In three cases, the post-DLI GvHD
was mild and resolved, however further three recipients
(two volunteer unrelated donor (VUD), one sibling)
experienced severe and fatal post-DLI GvHD (liver, liver/
gut and bronchiolitis obliterans), even though the total
CD3 þ dose was relatively low (median 2 Â 106
cells/kg,
0.96–2.5 Â 106
cells/kg).
Disease response and outcome
After a median follow-up of 371 days (59–1191), 26 out of
37 patients are alive (70%) and are in CR, and 11 died
(TRM n ¼ 6, relapse n ¼ 5). It is noteworthy that from
the ﬁve patients relapsed in our study, three out of ﬁve were
at advanced stage at transplant, four underwent sibling
allo-SCT and four received the higher (20 mg) alemtuzu-
mab dose. Outcome curves are shown in Figure 1. The
estimated 1- and 2-year OS probabilities for all patients
are 84% (95% CI, 9–19) and 57% (95% CI, 18–24),
respectively. The estimated 1- and 2-year EFS probabilities
are 75% (95% CI, 12–21) and 54% (95% CI, 18–23),
respectively.

Alemtuzumab pharmacokinetics
We measured serum alemtuzumab levels in eight patients
(ﬁve AML, three ALL) who received Campath-1H 10 mg
with a sensitive ELISA technique (limit of detection
31.25 ng/mL). A total of 54 samples (median seven
samples/patient) were tested from day À2 (15 min after
the end of the ﬁrst infusion of 5 mg Campath-1H) up to day
þ 30 after transplantation (Figure 1c). The median serum
peak level was 176 ng/mL (range 135–281) and was found
at day of transplantation (day 0). Alemtuzumab levels
declined slowly thereafter reaching a median serum level at
day þ 7 of 78 ng/mL (41–114) and at day þ 20 just above
the detection limit (median 42 ng/mL). Alemtuzumab was
still detected only in one out of four patients at day þ 30.
There was no difference in the alemtuzumab pharmacoki-
netics between AML and ALL patients. Campath levels
were not inﬂuenced by body weight or body surface area (r2
test).
Discussion
Pharmacokinetic studies of alemtuzumab at a total dose
of 100 mg (20 mg/day Â 5 days) before reduced intensity
conditioning transplantation have demonstrated that the
median serum peak level was 13 700 ng/mL, the alemtuzu-
mab concentration remained at high levels above 1000 ng/
mL at least 4 weeks after the last infusion and the estimated
time to achieve concentrations below the lymphotoxic
level (100 ng/mL) was 60 days.9
At a total dose of 50 mg
alemtuzumab (10 mg/day Â 5 days), Rebello et al.10
have
shown that the median serum peak level was 2500 ng/mL,
and Campath-1H persisted above 500 ng/mL (limit of
detection) at least 11 days after the last dose. To our
knowledge, we present here for the ﬁrst time pharmaco-
kinetic studies of lower doses of alemtuzumab in the HCT
setting. With our administration dose and timing (total
dose 10 mg, 5 mg/day at days À2 and À1), we achieved the
maximum peak level at day of stem cell infusion, which is
lymphotoxic but still 1–2 log lower as compared with the
100 mg and the 50 mg schedules. It must be noted however,
that the pharmacokinetics shown here may not apply to
patients with bulky lymphoid malignancy due to binding of
the antibody to CD52 þ tumor cells. Khouri et al.11
have
reported a fast drop of serum concentrations in patients
with active ALL or CLL.

Low-dose Campath in allogeneic transplantation for leukemia

of severe acute or chronic GvHD with our very low-dose
alemtuzumab schedule was low. Although direct compar-
ison is not possible, protocols using 50 mg alemtuzumab
report similar low incidences of acute and chronic
GvHD.3,4,11
Our GvHD incidence is in agreement with
two recent reports of low-dose alemtuzumab (10–20 mg)
when combined with CsA/MTX5
or CsA only.6
Most
nonrelapse deaths (three out of six) were attributed to post-
DLI GvHD. Though additional factors contributed to
these deaths (iron overload, lost of follow-up) these events
emphasize the need for careful selection of patients planed
to receive prophylactic DLI. Lutz et al.12
reported also a
high (69%) incidence of GvHD after prophylactic DLI,
which is higher than in studies reported DLI for relapsed or
progressive disease. Prospective randomized trials evaluat-
ing the value of prophylactic DLI are warranted.
The neutrophil, and especially the platelet engraftment
was rapid and compares favorably with other reports in
myeloablative PBSCT.13
We believe that both the omission
of MTX as well as the use of Campath, instead of ATG,
contributed to the rapid engraftment observed.14
Campath-
1 antibodies do not react with hematopoietic stem cells in
contrast with polyclonal ATG preparations, which contain
antibodies speciﬁc for chemokine receptors (CXCR4,
CCR5 and CCR7) and haematopoietic progenitor cells,
and thus may interfere with engraftment and regeneration.
In randomized studies, the addition of antithymocyte
globulin15
or anti-Jurkat ATG-Fresenius13
resulted in
delayed neutrophil and/or platelet engraftment. Although
we initially postulated that low-dose alemtuzumab will not
delay immune reconstitution after HCT, most patients
failed to reach normal CD4 þ counts within the ﬁrst year
and in 33% of them their number did not surpass 200 cells/
mL. Similar immune reconstitution kinetics have been
reported also with 100 mg and 50 mg alemtuzumab
schedules,1,2,16
however these reports include mainly
reduced intensity conditioning transplants and results in
the myeloablative setting with Camapth-1H are lacking.3,11
Although the incidence of CMV reactivation was high, in
contrast with the 100 mg schedule we did not observe late
CMV infections and no CMV disease occurred.
It is difﬁcult to compare the outcomes of our high-risk
leukemia patients with other series using Campath-1H, as
most studies have reported on lymphoma patients receiving
reduced intensity conditioning. Though the follow-up
period is still relatively short, the estimated 2-year OS
and EFS of 77% in unrelated allo-SCT (n ¼ 19) is very
encouraging and compares favorably with other series
of unrelated T-repleted myeloablative SCT for AML13
or
T-cell depleted myeloablative SCT with higher doses
Campath3,4,11
or ATG.13
Taken together, despite the single-center design of the
study, and the relative low number and heterogeneity of
treated patients, the results suggest that 10 mg alemtuzu-
mab before transplant combined with only CsA after
transplant may efﬁciently prevent severe acute and chronic
GVHD, after sibling PBSCT and higher doses are probably
not required. With the 10 mg alemtuzumab schedule
(5 mg/day at days À2 and À1), we achieve at day of
transplantation, low but still lymphotoxic alemtuzumab
concentrations, whereas levels decline fast thereafter, and at
the time of engraftment nearly no Campath antibody
remains in the patient’s serum. Such fast clearance of the
low-dose alemtuzumab may prove beneﬁcial regarding
safety and GvL efﬁcacy. The optimal minimal dose of
alemtuzumab for preventing GvHD in the unrelated setting
probably ranges between 10–20 mg, however prospective
randomized trials evaluating also the inﬂuence of addi-
tional parameters like the presence of mismatches and the
time of CsA withdrawn, are needed.
