INTRODUCTION
Indications for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(HSCT) in childhood and adolescence have expanded and
include hematological malignancies, aplastic anemia, non-
hematological malignancies and inherited metabolic disor-
ders (1, 2). With the cumulative experiences in HSCT and
advances in supportive care, the number of long-term sur-
vivors after HSCT has increased. However, graft versus host
disease (GvHD) following HSCT can affect multiple organs
chronically and requires prolonged treatment. In addition,
conditioning regimens for HSCT including high dose che-
motherapy and total body irradiation (TBI) cause long-term
complications. Among the late effects, endocrine complica-
tions are most prevalent (3, 4) and have significant impacts
on physical and mental health. The endocrine organs are high-
ly sensitive to chemotherapy and irradiation because they
contain a relatively high proportion of growing cells that are
more susceptible to the deleterious effects of these treatment
modalities.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term
effects of HSCT on various endocrine functions in children
and adolescents and to evaluate the associated risk factors for
endocrine complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study populations
The subjects of this study were patients who underwent a
HSCT between 1998 and 2006 at The Catholic University
of Korea St. Mary’s Hospital, and were in prolonged remis-
sion for at least two years or longer. Clinical information was
obtained by a review of medical records and laboratory eval-
uations including pituitary hormones, thyroid function and
gonadal function. Data included the initial diagnosis, gender,
type of HSCT, age at HSCT, conditioning regimens (chemo-
therapeutic agents and TBI) and sexual maturity rating. The
study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of
The Catholic University of Korea St. Mary’s Hospital, and
informed consent was obtained from all the parents of the
patients.
A total of 114 subjects (61 males and 53 females) were
included in this study (Table 1). The mean age at HSCT was
8.3±4.1 (range 0.8-15.0) yr, and the mean time from the
HSCT to the last evaluation was 4.9±2.0 yr. The mean age
at the time of the last evaluation was 13.2±4.6 yr. The ini-
tial diagnoses included 47 cases (42.3%) of acute myeloge-
nous leukemia (AML), 33 cases (29.7%) of acute lymphoblas-

Endocrine Complications after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
during Childhood and Adolescence
Long-term survivors of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) during child-
hood and adolescence are at risk of developing endocrine complications. The pur-
pose of this study was to evaluate the long-term endocrine complications and their
associated risk factors among such patients. We reviewed the data from 111 patients
(59 males and 52 females) who underwent HSCT at the mean age of 8.3±4.1 yr.
Thirty patients (27.0%) had growth impairment, and seven (21.2%) out of 33 patients
who attained final height reached final height below 2 standard deviation (SD). The
final height SD score of the patients conditioned with total body irradiation (TBI) was
significantly lower than that of the patients conditioned without TBI (-1.18±1.14 vs.
-0.19±0.78, P=0.011). Thirteen patients (11.7%) developed hypothyroidism (11
subclinical, 2 central) 3.8±1.8 (range 1.6-6.2) yr after HSCT. Nineteen (65.5%) out
of 29 females had evidence of gonadal dysfunction, and 18 (64.3%) out of 28 males
had evidence of gonadal dysfunction. The risk for gonadal dysfunction was signifi-
cantly higher in females conditioned with busulfan/cyclophosphamide (P=0.003).
These results suggest that the majority of patients treated with HSCT during child-
hood and adolescence have one or more endocrine complications. Therefore, multi-
ple endocrine functions should be monitored periodically after HSCT until they reach
adult age.

tic leukemia (ALL), and 15 cases (13.5%) of severe aplastic
anemia (SAA). The other patients were diagnosed as Fanconi
anemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), malignant
lymphoma, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, endoder-
mal sinus tumor and pure red cell anemia. Preparation for
the HSCT included TBI in 63 subjects (56.8%), while a con-
ditioning regimen without TBI was used for the other pati-
ents (43.2%). All TBI was delivered with fractionation, and
the mean dose of TBI was 1,073.0±241.8 (maximum 1,200)
cGy.
Endocrine disorders at the time of HSCT or gonadal in-
volvement of the original disease were predefined exclusion
criteria, but none of the patients had such conditions.
Height measurement and assessment of pubertal status
Height was measured using a Harpenden stadiometer (Hol-
tain Ltd., Crymych, U.K.) at the time of the diagnosis, at
the time of the HSCT and every six months thereafter. The
growth status was evaluated with reference to the most recent
growth charts for Korean children and adolescents (5). The
pubertal status was determined by the method of Tanner and
Whitehouse (6).
Endocrine function tests
For the determination of endocrine function, thyroid hor-
mones, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), gonadotropins,
testosterone in males and estradiol in females were measured.
The following assay methods were used: immunoradiomet-
ric assay using TSH-CTK-3 (Diasorin SpA, Saluggia, Italy)
for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH); radioimmunoassay
using fT4-CTK (Diasorin SpA) for free T4; radioimmunoas-
say using T3-CTK (Diasorin SpA) for T3; radioimmunoas-
say (Biosource Technologies, Inc., Nivelles, Belgium) for IGF-
I; immunoradiometric assay using LH-CTK-4 (Diasorin SpA)
for luteinizing hormone (LH); immunoradiometric assay
using FSH-CTK-4 (Diasorin SpA) for follicle stimulating
hormone (FSH); radioimmunoassay using Testosterone RIA
CT (RaDIM SpA, Rome, Italy) for testosterone; radioim-
munoassay using Estradiol MAIA kit (Adaltis Italia, Reno,
Italy) for estradiol. Bone age was determined by the Greulich
Pyle method (7). Pelvic ultrasonogram was performed in the
selected female patients with delayed puberty.
The patients who met one out of the following two crite-
ria were categorized as having growth impairment: 1) height
below 2 standard deviation (SD); or 2) growth velocity below
2 SD (4 cm/yr). Growth hormone (GH) deficiency was defined
by decreased peak GH concentrations (<10 ng/mL) in two or
more GH stimulation tests while fulfilling criteria for growth
impairment (8). Hypothyroidism was defined as free T4 level
below 0.8 ng/dL, and subclinical (compensated) hypothy-
roidism as free T4 level above 0.8 ng/dL with TSH level above
6.4 mIU/L (9). The final height was defined as a height veloci-
ty of less than 0.5 cm/yr and/or adult bone age. Obesity was
defined as body mass index (BMI) for age and gender high-
er than the 95th percentile. Dyslipidemia (abnormal lipid
profiles) was defined as triglyceride ≥110 mg/dL or HDL
≤40 mg/dL measured on two or more separate serum sam-
ples after fasting (10).
Gonadal function was determined in female patients who
were 13 yr or older and in male patients 14 yr or older. Go-
nadal dysfunction in females was defined as elevated levels of
FSH or LH or the use of estrogen therapy (8). Gonadal dys-
function in males was defined as elevated levels of FSH or LH
or the use of androgen replacement (8). Abnormally elevated
gonadotropin levels in female subjects were defined as FSH
levels ≥15 IU/mL, and LH levels ≥20 IU/mL. Abnormal-
ly elevated gonadotropin levels in male subjects were defined
as FSH levels ≥15 IU/mL, and LH levels ≥10 IU/mL. These
cutoff levels were chosen according to the values used at the
St. Mary’s Hospital laboratory and reference values from the
medical literatures (11).
Statistical analysis
The data was expressed as mean±standard deviation. Lab-
oratory and clinical variables were compared using the t-test.
The differences in categorical factors between groups were
analyzed by the Pearson’s chi-square test and Fisher’s exact
test as appropriate. Comparison of the final height and mid-
parental height for each patient was performed using paired
t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. The statistical analy-
ses were performed using SPSS statistical software package
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A.). A P value <0.05 was con-
sidered to be statistically significant.

RESULTS
Growth impairment and final height
The height SD score at diagnosis and at HSCT was 0.41±
1.07 and 0.07±1.45, respectively (Fig. 1). Thirty patients
(27.0%) were categorized as having growth impairment, and
six of them had GH deficiency (Table 2). A total of 33 pati-
ents (21 females and 12 males) attained their final height by
criteria at the time of the study. The final height SD score
in the female and male patients was -0.51±1.03 and -1.28
±1.14, respectively (P=0.058, Table 3). The final height
SD score of the patients who were conditioned with TBI was
significantly lower than that of the patients who were treated
without TBI (-1.18±1.14 vs. -0.19±0.78, P=0.011). The
final height SD score of the patients who underwent HSCT
before pubertal age (10 yr in females and 12 yr in males, de-
fined arbitrarily) was significantly lower than that of the pati-
ents who underwent HSCT at or after pubertal age (-1.63±
1.16 vs. -0.43±0.89, P=0.003). The final height SD score
was not influenced by initial diagnosis, type of HSCT or
development of chronic GvHD.
Among the 33 patients who attained final height, seven (4
females, 3 males) (21.2%) reached final height lower than -2.0
SD. The final height SD score was -2.65±0.74 for females
and -2.17±0.22 for males. Their initial diagnoses included
3 ALL, 2 SAA, one AML and one CML. The age at HSCT
was 10.6±4.4 yr for females and 10.9±3.7 yr for males. The
midparental height was 158.1±6.1 cm for females and 171.2
±2.8 cm for males.
Thyroid dysfunction
Thirteen patients (11.7%) developed hypothyroidism dur-
ing the follow-up period. Eleven of them were categorized
as subclinical hypothyroidism, and the others had central
(pituitary or hypothalamic) hypothyroidism (Table 2). The
mean duration from HSCT to diagnosis of hypothyroidism
was 3.8±1.8 yr (range 1.6-6.2 yr). The risk of thyroid dys-
function was not associated with gender, conditioning regi-
men with TBI, initial diagnosis, type of HSCT or chronic

GvHD. The incidence of hypothyroidism in the patients with
growth impairment was higher than that of the patients with-
out growth impairment (23.3% vs. 7.4%, P=0.040, OR=
3.8 [1.2-12.5]) (Table 4).
Gonadal dysfunction
Nineteen (65.5%) out of 29 females had evidence of gonadal
dysfunction, and one female patient was diagnosed as preco-
cious puberty (Table 2). Eighteen (64.3%) out of 28 males
had evidence of gonadal dysfunction. The incidence of gona-
dal dysfunction in female patients conditioned with TBI was
similar to that of females treated without TBI (Table 5). All
12 female patients conditioned with busulfan/cyclophos-
phamide developed gonadal dysfunction. The risk for gona-
dal dysfunction in this group was significantly higher than
that of the patients who were not conditioned with busulfan/
cyclophosphamide (100% vs. 43.8%, P=0.003). The inci-
dence of gonadal dysfunction was not influenced by the age
at HSCT, conditioning regimen or chronic GvHD in male
patients (Table 6). The final height and final height SD score
of hypogonadic females were not different from those of the
female patients with normal gonadal function (Table 5). In
the female patients with normal gonadal function, the final
height (155.8±3.1 cm) was significantly lower than the mid-
parental height (159.0±3.2 cm) (P=0.038). By contrast, the
final height of hypogonadic females was not different from
their midparental height. The final height and final height
SD score of hypogonadic males were not different from those
of the male patients with normal gonadal function (Table 6).
In the hypogonadic male patients, the final height (164.6±
6.1 cm) was significantly lower than the midparental height
(170.7±4.0 cm) (P=0.012). By contrast, the final height of
the male patients with normal gonadal function was not dif-
ferent from their midparental height.
Obesity and body mass index
Four patients (3.6%) met the criteria for obesity during the
follow-up period, and nineteen (17.1%) had abnormal lipid
profiles (Table 2). The BMI of the female patients who attain-
ed their final height was 21.0±3.3 kg/m2
(range 15.5-28.7
kg/m2
). The BMI of the male patients who attained their final
height was 20.1±3.1 kg/m2
(range 15.3-24.7 kg/m2
).
DISCUSSION
The results of this study show that a quarter of the patients
who underwent HSCT during childhood or adolescence devel-
oped growth impairment. The risk of attaining a final height
lower than -2.0 SD was around 20%. The clinical determinants

regimen with TBI and younger (prepubertal) age at HSCT.
Many factors have been suggested to contribute to growth
failure after HSCT (12-14). TBI used for the preparation of
HSCT can impair linear growth by various mechanisms, such
as GH deficiency and skeletal dysplasia (15). Some investiga-
tors have reported that disproportionate growth of the spine or
long bones account for height loss after TBI (16, 17). Younger
age at HSCT is a well known risk factor for a decrease in adult
height (14, 18, 19). An increase in the incidence of GH defi-
ciency after HSCT has been reported in several studies (14,
20), but transiency of the GH deficient state has also been
reported (19, 21). In our study, the incidence of GH deficiency
among patients with growth impairment was about 20%.
The effect of GH replacement on the final height of patients
who underwent HSCT during childhood has not been deter-
mined.
Among children and adolescents who were treated with-
out HSCT, radiation exposure to the head and neck is a known
risk factor for subsequent hypothyroidism. Following radia-
tion doses above 15 cGy, the incidence of primary hypothy-
roidism was reported to be 40-90% in patients with Hodg-
kin’s disease, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma or head/neck malig-
nancies (22, 23). Meanwhile, according to a recent study,
chemotherapy, either alone or in combination with radiation,
was not associated with an increase in the incidence of hypo-
thyroidism (23).
In our analysis, the incidence of thyroid dysfunction after
HSCT was 11.7%. Most of the cases with thyroid dysfunc-
tion had subclinical hypothyroidism, while central hypothy-
roidism was rare. Hypothyroidism is a well known common
complication of TBI conditioning regimens. The overall inci-
dence of primary hypothyroidism after fractionated TBI has
been reported to be 10 to 28% (19, 20, 24). However, reports
of thyroid dysfunction in patients conditioned with a chemo-
therapy-only based regimen (25) have indicated that irradi-
ation of the thyroid gland is not the only risk factor. It was
reported that abnormalities of thyroid function including
severe primary hypothyroidism occurred after HSCT in 10.8%
of children with immunodeficiency who received chemother-
apy conditioning (with busulfan/cyclophosphamide) with-
out TBI (26). In our study, five (12.7%) out of 48 patients
treated with a conditioning regimen without TBI developed
hypothyroidism. Therefore, children and adolescents who
undergo HSCT should be considered to be at high risk for
thyroid dysfunction whether or not they receive TBI.
In a large multi-center study of long-term thyroid outcome
after HSCT, Berger et al. (9) showed that the incidence of
thyroid dysfunction was increased with prolongation of the
follow-up period. The maximum interval between HSCT
and the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction was reported to be
up to 11 yr (9) and was 6.2 yr in our study. We did not find
evidence of an increased risk for thyroid neoplasms or autoim-
mune thyroid disease following HSCT.
Gonadal dysfunction after HSCT was observed at a very
high rate in both females (65.5%) and males (64.3%). The
use of busulfan/cyclophosphamide in the conditioning regi-
men was found to be a significant risk factor for gonadal dys-
function in the female patients. The increased incidence of
gonadal dysfunction in the female patients with AML might
reflect the impact of busulfan/cyclophosphamide on ovaries,
because most of the AML patients were conditioned using
busulfan/cyclophosphamide in our protocol. Our findings
did not show an association between TBI or patient age and
gonadal dysfunction in females. These results might have
been due to a confounding influence of chemotherapy includ-
ing busulfan/cyclophosphamide or by the small number of
the subjects. It has been reported that ovarian failure devel-
oped in all patients older than 10 yr at the time they are treat-
ed with TBI (27, 28). By contrast, ovarian failure, following
treatment with busulfan/cyclophosphamide, has been observed
in patients treated before and after the onset of puberty (29).
Previous studies have shown that Leydig cell function gen-
erally is preserved in males treated with TBI-based condi-
tioning regimens (12, 27). By contrast, germ cell dysfunc-
tion has been reported to be present in most males treated
with TBI as indicated by elevated FSH levels (30). In our
study, damage to Leydig cell function after HSCT indicated
by abnormally elevated LH levels was observed in 17.9% of
the males. Meanwhile, abnormally elevated FSH levels sug-
gesting germ cell dysfunction was observed in 57.1% of the
males. The impact of HSCT on germ cell function could vary
depending on the follow-up duration and the age at the time
of treatment, and requires more specific evaluation methods
for confirmation.
Interestingly, loss of final height compared to midparental
height was observed in females with normal gonadal function
and in hypogonadic males, but not in hypogonadic females
and in males with normal gonadal function. This observation
suggests that sex hormone deficiency has a different impact
on the final height in males and females. Further study is
needed to determine whether delayed initiation of sex steroid
replacement in hypogonadic females or early initiation of treat-
ment in hypogonadic males result in a better height outcome.
There are some limitations to this study, in addition to the
variety of the initial diagnoses included, that needs to be con-
sidered when interpreting the results. Chemotherapeutic
agents or radiation therapy performed before HSCT has con-
siderable influence on long-term endocrine functions. In this
study, the chemotherapy protocols and doses of radiation ther-
apy used before HSCT yielded too many combinations that
we were unable to isolate the impact of HSCT from the influ-
ence of pre-HSCT treatment on endocrine functions. To over-
come this limitation, further analysis of patients with homoge-
nous diagnosis and common protocols needs to be done.
In conclusion, the results of this study show that after HSCT
during childhood and adolescence a significant number of
patients develop growth impairment, a reduced final height
and/or subclinical hypothyroidism. Gonadal dysfunction was
1076 M.H. Jung, K.S. Cho, J.W. Lee, et al.
observed in approximately two thirds of the patients who
underwent HSCT. The risk of endocrine complications was
most commonly associated with the conditioning regimen
including TBI and chemotherapy including busulfan/cyclo-
phosphamide. However, factors such as gender and the age
at the time of treatment also had some impact on the com-
plications observed. Multiple endocrine functions should be
monitored regularly after HSCT until the patients reach adult
age.
