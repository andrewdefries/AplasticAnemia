Valproic acid (VPA), a branched short-chain fatty acid, is widely used as an antiepileptic drug and a mood stabilizer. Antiepileptic
properties have been attributed to inhibition of Gamma Amino Butyrate (GABA) transaminobutyrate and of ion channels. VPA
was recently classiﬁed among the Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors, acting directly at the level of gene transcription by inhibiting
histone deacetylation and making transcription sites more accessible. VPA is a widely used drug, particularly for children suﬀering
from epilepsy. Due to the increasing number of clinical trials involving VPA, and interesting results obtained, this molecule will be
implicated in an increasing number of therapies. However side eﬀects of VPA are substantially described in the literature whereas
they are poorly discussed in articles focusing on its therapeutic use. This paper aims to give an overview of the diﬀerent clinical-
trials involving VPA and its side eﬀects encountered during treatment as well as its molecular properties.
1. Introduction
Valproic acid (2-propylvaleric acid, 2-propylpentanoic acid
or n-dipropylacetic acid) (see Figure 1(a)), derived from
valeric acid (Figure 1(b)) (naturally produced by valerian,
Valeriana oﬃcinalis) (see Figure 1(c)), was ﬁrst synthesized
in 1882 by Burton [1]. It is a branched short-chain fatty
acid, forming a clear liquid at room temperature, and
whose half-life is 9 to 16 hours. For nearly a century,
this molecule was used as a “physiologically inert” solvent
for organic compounds. It was in 1963, during a study
focused on molecules with potential anti-convulsive activity,
in which VPA was used as a molecular carrier, that the
pharmacological activity of VPA was demonstrated: VPA
prevented pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions in rodents
[2–4].
In the human brain, VPA alters the activity of the neu-
rotransmitter Gamma Amino Butyrate (GABA) by poten-
tialising the inhibitory activity of GABA through several
mechanisms, including inhibition of GABA degradation,
inhibition of GABA Transaminobutyratre (ABAT), increased
GABA synthesis, and decreased turnover [5]. Moreover, VPA
attenuates N-Methyl-D-Aspartate-mediated excitation [6, 7]
and blocks Na+ channels, Ca2+ channels (voltage-dependent
L type CACNA1 type C, D, N, and F), and voltage-gated K+
channels (SCN) [8].
Besides its clinical use as an anticonvulsant and mood-
stabilizing drug [9], VPA presents beneﬁcial eﬀects in clinical
depression [10], absence seizures [11, 12], tonic-clonic
seizures, complex partial seizures [13], juvenile myoclonic
epilepsy [14], seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syn-
drome [15], migraine headaches, and schizophrenia. VPA as
a therapeutic agent is commercially available as Depakote,
Depakote ER, Depakene, Depacon, Stavzor, Mylproin,
Ergenyl, Dipropylacetic acid, Myproic Acid, Dipropylacetate,
and Convulex.
More recently VPA has been described as an HDAC
inhibitor, resulting in an increased interest for its use in
cancer therapy. Chromatin is formed of DNA packaged in
nucleosome structures, constituted by 146 base-pair DNA
sequence winding around an octamere of histones (two
copies of each histone: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) held in
place by histone H1. The condensed form of chromatin
(heterochromatin) is inactive in terms of transcription
whereas the decondensed form (euchromatin) corresponds
to an active form. The transition between euchromatin
and heterochromatin is dependent upon two families of
proteins: histone acetyl transferases (HATs), and histone
2 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology
deacetylases (HDACs). It has been established that histone
acetylation leads to relaxation of the nucleosome structure,
releasing the DNA and allowing transcription. Inhibition of
HDAC promotes decondensed chromatin formation, thereby
promoting the expression of genes.
VPA, as well as other HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), is able
to alter expression of many genes. Corresponding proteins
were described to play important roles in cellular activity and
could inﬂuence several important pathways such as cell cycle
control, diﬀerentiation, DNA repair, and apoptosis [16–19].
VPA speciﬁcally targets 2 of the 4 classes of HDACs:
class I, subclasses Ia and Ib, and class II, subclass IIa. Within
subclass IIa, HDAC9 is an exception to this modulation,
being activated by VPA, which is also true for HDAC11 [20].
HDAC 6, 8, and 10 are not modulated. It is interesting to
mention that HDAC classes I and II have been reported to
be strongly implicated in neuronal function, which could
partially explain the action of VPA in neural pathologies.
DNA methylation also contributes to the regulation of
gene expression. Hypermethylation of the promoter, usually
corresponding to inhibition of gene expression, is con-
trolled by DNA methytransferase (DNMT). Demethylation
of nucleic acid has been commonly associated with pas-
sive processes corresponding to inhibition of maintenance
methylation during S-Phase of the cell cycle. The existence
of DNA demethylase was shown a decade ago, resulting
in a demethylated active DNA form [21, 22]. HDACi have
been associated with demethylation of DNA, and since 2001,
were associated with the active demethylated form. The
exact mechanism is not yet known, but it seems that VPA
does not directly enhance the enzymatic activity of DNA
demethylase. However, through HDACi activity, VPA enables
methylated DNA to be more accessible, which is conﬁrmed
by the observation that inhibition of HAT diminishes the
demethylation eﬀect triggered by VPA [23, 24]. In addition, it
has been shown that valproic acid downregulates expression
of proteins essential for chromatin maintenance: SMCs 1-
6 (Structural Maintenance of chromatin 1 to 6), DNMT1
(DNA methyl transferase-1), and HP1 (Heterochromatin
Protein-1) [25]. The eﬀects upon transcription are observed
after less than 24 hours, while 48 hours are needed to see
the eﬀects upon protein levels, which correlates with DNA
decondensation (shown in breast cancer cell lines).
Recently, it has been shown that VPA is also able to
induce mono-, di-, or tri-methylation of histone 3, particu-
larly at lysine 9 (H3K4) [20, 26–28]. Methylation of histones
at this lysine is associated with increased transcriptional
activity. However, this phenomenon and its purpose are not
currently clear, considering the speciﬁc site of methylation,
and the fact that it only occurs on already hyperacetylated
histones, and near-demethylated genes. It is assumed that
this modiﬁcation could serve to stabilize the transiently
released form of chromatin, mediated by histone acetylation
[28].
Among many drugs named as “molecular therapies,”
epigenetic drugs are between the most encouraging, because
in contrast to other drugs that target the expression of a
molecule or a family of molecules, they target chromatin
through associated proteins (HDAC, DNMT, HP1, and

SMCs). Thus, epigenetic drugs aﬀect the expression of many
proteins and therefore may be applicable to a wide range of
pathologies, especially cancer, where multiple antioncogens
are repressed during carcinogenesis. Epigenetic drugs could
particularly target these repressed tumor suppressor genes.
Moreover, given that the balance of acetylation and
deacetylation, under the control of HAT and HDAC, is
not restricted to histones [29], it can be hypothesized that
VPA, like other HDACi, could modulate molecular activity
in addition to transcription. Targeted genes could be Ku
(releasing BAX), STAT3, HSP90, p53, and various transcrip-
tion factors. Candidates have already been mentioned in a
preliminary study in 2005 [30].
For all the signaling pathways modulated, it has not
been established if VPA acts through epigenetic regulation,
inhibition of acetylation of molecules other than histones, or
by other molecular mechanisms.

2. VPA Targets a Wide Range of Pathologies
Valproic acid used in therapy is available in many formu-
lations: syrup, suppositories, tablets, or locale injection; the
diﬀerent formulations can aﬀect the bioavailability and rate
of absorption of the molecule. Classically age or weight
has no inﬂuence in VPA serum concentration. There is no
proportional relationship between the dose administrated
and the serum concentration [31]. Diet plays also a role in the
rate of absorption as VPA is more rapidly bioavailable when
ingested before feeding. Finally, the serum concentration
can be strongly inﬂuenced by combination with pheny-
toin (49.5%), carbamazepine (66.2%), or phenobarbital
(76.3%) than when given alone (100%). On average, 250 mg
VPA ingested induce a serum concentration of 54.6 ug/mL
(0.34 mM) [32]. Overdosage of VPA results in somnolence,
heart block or deep coma.
2.1. Neurological Diseases. Many of the neurodegenerative
diseases identiﬁed today have genetic causes. Spinal muscular
atrophy (SMA) is caused by the homozygous loss of the
SMN1 gene (survival motor neuron protein). The eﬀects of
the loss of this gene could be modulated by expression of
the Fl-SMN2 protein (Full Length), which determines the
severity of the disease [33]. VPA is a promising candidate
for Fl-SMN2-overexpression therapies, because it has been
shown that it is able to increase both SMN transcript and
protein levels in SMA patients. However, the speciﬁcity of
target of several HDACi members decreases their eﬀective-
ness and could lead to the choice of less speciﬁc molecules,
such as SAHA [28].
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the degeneration of
nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. To date, several scien-
tiﬁc papers have shown no eﬀect of VPA on PD. However,
recent in vitro studies have shown positive eﬀects of VPA
in models mimicking PD at diﬀerent levels: VPA treatment
prevents apoptosis induced by rotenone (inducing PD-like
neurodegeneration); protects neurons from dopaminergic
toxin 1-methyl-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) by stimulating
the release of trophic substances from glia; protects cul-
tured dopaminergic neurons from over-activated microglia-
induced degeneration by promoting microglia apoptosis and
protects neurons by increasing α-synuclein expression and
preventing its monoubiquitination and nuclear transloca-
tion [34–37]. In rodents, experiments show that selective
alterations of α-synuclein caused by rotenone (decrease of
the native protein and an increase in monoubiquitination in
substantia nigra and striatum) are counteracted by long-term
administration of VPA [38].
Past clinical trials had showed a lack of VPA activity in
patients with Huntington’s disease (HD) [39], which is sur-
prising given that the molecular explanation for this disease
involves excitotoxicity and reduced gene transcription due
to decreased levels of histone acetylation. However, a recent
study showed that using high doses of VPA (100 mg/kg/days)
is capable of prolonging life expectancy and improving
traction [40]. This study, based on tests conducted on the
N171-82Q transgenic mouse model of HD, showed that
following chronic intraperitoneal daily administration, VPA
signiﬁcantly improved the condition of mice, increasing the
number of the surviving mice and reducing the decrease in
motor activity, and this without exerting any noteworthy side
eﬀects upon behavior or striatal dopamine content at the
dose administered. This study therefore recommends further
clinical trials, based on increasing doses of VPA administered
in mono- or polytherapy.
2.2. Addiction. The GABAergic system is involved in psy-
chostimulant sensitization, and VPA can modulate central
GABAergic neurotransmission. An initial study, conducted
on mice, showed that multiple injections of VPA, admin-
istered consecutively after methamphetamine, could reduce
the addictive behavior induced by this drug. However,
this eﬀect is not reproducible for cocaine-induced behavior
[41]. These initial results indicated that these forms of
addiction should not involve the same neural mechanisms.
A clinical study of VPA use in treating addiction to various
substances particularly targeted the stage of detoxiﬁcation
prior to treatment and rehabilitation. It was shown that
a combination of Buprenorphine and VPA seems to be
the most appropriate for detoxiﬁcation, compared to the
traditional combination Clonidine and Carbamazepine [42].
Several addictions, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and
compulsive sexual behaviors have similarities in their pro-
cesses, and, in the use of VPA, may ﬁnd a possible therapeutic
treatment.
2.3. HIV Infection. Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) has
been implicated in maintaining HIV in infected cells. The
inhibitory action of VPA upon this protein makes it a
good candidate for AIDS therapy. A study published in
2005 undertaken with four patients, showed that three
of them treated with valproic acid in addition to highly
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), showed a reduction
in latent HIV infection [43]. However, a subsequent study
showed that VPA, alone and in a long-term treatment, is not
suﬃcient to reduce the size of the HIV-1 reserve [44].
2.4. Other Pathologies. The possibility of using VPA in
treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a skeletal
muscle degeneration disease, was recently demonstrated in
vitro and in vivo on mice mdx/utrn−/−
[45]. This study
showed that VPA is able to induce the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K
pathway, through the induction of phosphatidylinositol 3-
OH kinase (PI3K), resulting in lower collagen content and
ﬁbrosis, a decrease of hind limb contractures, an increase of
sarcolemmal integrity, a decrease of CD8-positive inﬂamma-
tory cells and higher levels of activated Akt in muscles.
3. VPA Targets Signaling Pathways in
Cancer Cells
Epigenetic processes, such as histone deacetylation and DNA
methylation, are known to contribute to the cancerous
transformation of cells by silencing critical genes, leading
to chemotherapy resistance. It has been hypothesized that
HDACi act through a derepression or a stimulation of
4 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology
silenced tumor suppressor genes [46–48]. Several data
demonstrate the ability of these epigenetic drugs to modulate
global gene expression in tumors (Figure 2).
VPA modulates expression of p21WAF1/CDKN1A [49],
a CDK (cyclin dependent kinase) generally associated with
cell cycle arrest in G1/S phase. VPA appears to induce
an increase in the amount of p21WAF1 protein over 48
hours in AML cells, which is independent of p53 levels
(whose expression is not modulated by VPA), but appears
to be dependent on c-myc, whose mRNA and protein levels
decrease in a dose-dependent manner during VPA treatment.
Under VPA treatment, transcription of c-myc is dependent
upon JNK/SAPK, and ectopic expression of c-myc, leading to
more resistant cells in cell cycle arrest, shows the importance
of this protein in VPA-mediated activity. In addition to this,
while VPA treatment in the cell lines is followed by a decrease
of c-myc and an induction of p21, it has been observed that
in primary AML cells, only the systematic decrease of c-myc
is maintained, without upregulation of p21 expression.
VPA-induced apoptosis, via the extrinsic pathway involv-
ing engagement of the caspase-8-dependent cascade, sensi-
tizes cells to TRAIL/Apo2L-mediated apoptosis by increasing
expression of DR4 and DR5 by 3- and 14-fold, respectively.
In the absence of TRAIL/Apo2L, VPA is able to reduce the
expression of antiapoptotic factors acting on both extrinsic
and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, including c-FLIPs, proteins
associated with DISC and Bcl-2/Bcl-X(L). When applied
with TRAIL/Apo2L, VPA increased cell death and caspase-
3 activity. These results were reproduced in AML, CLL,
thoracic cancers, and hepatocellular carcinoma [50–53].
VPA induces Caspase-11 and FAS-L at the transcriptomic
level, and Caspase-3 at the proteomic level during exposition
[54]. Long treatment periods result in enhancement of Fas-
dependent apoptosis associated with an overexpression of
Fas and Fas ligand, and a central role in Bcl-2 inhibition [55].
It has been reported that VPA increased β-catenin levels
through concentration-dependent inhibition of glycogen
synthase kinase 3-β (and 3α) activity, and tau phosphory-
lation [56]. On one hand, this resulted in the inhibition of
ubiquitination of β-catenin and on the other hand, in the
inhibition of c-jun phosphorylation leading to an increase
in the DNA binding activity of AP-1. Inhibition of β-catenin
ubiquitination led to its translocation into the nucleus, and
resultant upregulation of c-myc transcription.
The PI3-kinase/Akt pathway and Sp1 are involved in
HSP70 induction by HDAC inhibitors, and induction of
HSP70 by VPA in cortical neurons may contribute to its
neuroprotective and therapeutic eﬀects [57].
In medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) cells, VPA is able
to modify the expression of Notch1, by increasing its
expression, resulting in inhibition of the growth of these cells
and the induction of apoptosis. These results along with the
apparent tolerance of patients to VPA treatment have led to
the suggestion to involve VPA being in future clinical trials
on advanced medullary thyroid cancer [58].
PPAR signaling is involved in several biochemical regula-
tion processes, including lipidic metabolism, diﬀerentiation,
insulin sensitivity, and cell survival. VPA appeared to be
a pan-activator of PPAR (both PPARα, also PPARδ and
PPARγ) [59, 60]. This mechanism could be one factor
favoring the teratogenic eﬀect of VPA [60]. In contrast, it
was reported that in neuronal cells VPA induced a signiﬁcant
decrease in PPARγ signaling [61]. These results highlight
potential tissue-speciﬁc eﬀects of VPA, as observed in several
publications, and the diﬃculties in predicting its eﬀects prior
to clinical trials.
In similar fashion, HDAC3 is involved in inhibition
of STAT3 phosphorylation [62]. This inhibition led to a
decrease in the dimerisation of STAT3 and its translocation
into the nucleus for transcriptional activation of many genes
in a wide range of biological processes, including induction
of immune response, oncogenesis, cell cycle control, develop-
ment, cell adhesion, and diﬀerentiation [63]. HDAC3 is one
of the direct targets of VPA, but until now no papers present
data concerning the eﬀect of VPA on the STAT3 pathway.
4. Clinical Trials with VPA
As previously mentioned, several reports have demonstrated
the ability of epigenetic drugs to modulate global gene
expression in tumors. In many cases, such drugs have moved
into the ﬁrst or second phase of clinical trials for treatment
of various solid cancers or leukemia, and in cotreatment with
several chemotherapeutic agents (Table 1).
VPA is used for many years in the treatment of convulsive
seizures and in chronic treatment of epilepsy. Highlighting its
HDAC inhibitory property and therefore its potential action
on some cancers has made this molecule, already well known,
a top candidate in new clinical trials.
Valproic acid has been implicated in more than two
hundred clinical trials, sometimes in association with other
drugs and involving various pathologies, ranging from
mood disorders to cancers, through treatment of narcotic
addictions, muscle disorders, and the ability to reduce viral
load in AIDS patients (http://clinicaltrials.gov/).
However, concerning cancer prevention and therapy, a
recent study on a population taking VPA over a long period
(minimum 1500 g in the last 5 years) demonstrated that it
had no signiﬁcant eﬀect upon prevention of cancer develop-
ment [64] and thus is not eligible for chemoprevention.
4.1. Clinical Trial in Noncancerous Disorders. VPA has been
used for many years as a treatment against epilepsy and
convulsive disorders. Today, the majority of clinical trials
involving VPA relate to neural pathology, applying to more
than thirty diﬀerent pathologies.
One clinical study aims to compare the antiaggressive
eﬃcacy of risperidone monotherapy versus risperidone
in combination with valproate in patients suﬀering from
schizophrenia. The random blind test, including 33 patients
(16 with risperidone and 17 with polytreatment), was unable
to show any signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the treatments,
except a higher capacity of patients under combination ther-
apy to complete the study [65]. The use of valproic acid was
investigated for its ability to improve mood stabilization. The
blind clinical trial aimed to assess the capacity of lamotrigine
or VPA to increase mood stabilization for patients with

Figure 2: Pharmacological activity of VPA described in the literature. Schematic representation of direct and indirect targets of VPA.
Principal direct targets known for VPA are ionic channels and ABAT (in green). Epigenetic action of VPA (in violet) as HDACi activity:
VPA targets the transcriptomic system and principally directly inhibits HDAC class I (subcategories 1, 2, and 3), and less strongly class
II/a (subcategories 4, 5, and 7), but induces HDAC 9 and 11, and indirectly inhibits the function of SMC and DNMT. Probably due to
its epigenetic properties, or interactions not yet established, VPA alters, directly or indirectly, expression of many molecules involved in
molecular pathways such as apoptosis, inﬂammation, diﬀerentiation, and proliferation (in red).

schizophrenia who are both stabilized and partially respon-
sive [66]. Eﬃciency assessment was evaluated using the Pos-
itive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Calgary Depression Scale
for Schizophrenia, Demoralization Scale, Clinical Global
Impression severity and improvement scores and Lehman
quality of life improvement scale to assess quality of life
and social functioning. The increase of antipsychotics usage
with mood stabilizers like lamotrigine or VPA for partially
responsive patients with chronic schizophrenia seems to be
an ineﬃcient treatment strategy for improving the residual
symptoms.
A clinical trial to establish the diﬀerence between VPA
and Propranolol in the treatment of pediatric migraine
prophylaxis was undertaken on a population of 120 patients
aged from 3 to 15 years. The results showed no signiﬁcant dif-
ference in all therapeutic eﬀects between the two molecules,
with a mean of 70% response and a reduction of >50% in
headache frequency [67].
A clinical trial concerning agitation of older people with
dementia was based upon the use of VPA as a treatment over
several years, without any conclusive clinical trials able to
show the eﬀects. The results presented were based on the
compilation of three incomplete clinical studies and show
that VPA does not induce any improvement in pathology but
does present an unacceptable rate of side eﬀects [68].
Acute mania is a behavioral disorder outcome of bipolar
disorder, also known as manic-depressive disorder, manic
depression, or bipolar aﬀective disorder. Compilation of
data provided by European Mania in Bipolar Evaluation
of Medication (EMBLEM) concerning the comparison of
olanzapine and valproic acid treatments on a panel of over
600 patients (n = 107 valproate, n = 514 olanzapine),
demonstrated that olanzapine monotherapy seems to be
more eﬀective than valproate monotherapy in the treatment
of acute mania [69].
In contrast, a recent systematic review about the eﬀect
of VPA upon 142 patients with acute bipolar depression
shows a signiﬁcant eﬀect of this molecule for the reduction
of depressive symptoms of acute bipolar depression, as well
as high patient tolerance [70]. The outcomes investigated
were depression, anxiety, hypomania, attrition, and adverse
events, and the study analyzed existing randomized control
trial data for the eﬃcacy and tolerability of valproate.
Results are particularly conclusive for depression (50%
improvement, for 22% of patients), but inconclusive for
anxiety, and there was no evidence for an increased risk
of mania, as it also induces long-term antidepressant
eﬀects.
VPA was investigated for clinical therapy of amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS). This prognostic neuropathy was
studied in 163 patients who received either VPA (1500 mg)
or placebo, daily. The end points targeted were survival and
progression of the disease. This study concluded that VPA
had no beneﬁcial eﬀect upon survival or disease progression
in patients with ALS [71].
A phase II study of the eﬀect of VPA upon spinal
muscular atrophy (SMA), with a panel of 2 SMA type I
(ages 2-3 years), 29 SMA type II (ages 2–14 years), and
11 type III (ages 2–31 years) was recently published. The
investigation focused upon several factors, such as assess-
ment of gross motor function (via the modiﬁed Hammer-
smith Functional Motor Scale: MHFMS), electrophysiologic
measures of innervations (with maximum ulnar compound
muscle action potential amplitudes: CMAP) and motor unit
number estimation (MUNE), body composition, and bone
density via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), and
quantitative blood SMN mRNA levels, as well as carnitine
depletion, hepatotoxicity, and increased weakness (for the
side eﬀects). Results revealed a trend of weight gain but
also an increase of gross motor function in 27 patients,
all of them with SMA type II and younger than ﬁve years
old. There was no variation in expression of SMN protein
(survival motor neuron protein), but bone mineral density
and innervations increased signiﬁcantly (P ≤ .0001). In
conclusion, the results presented by this preliminary study
highlight the strengths and limitations of using a large
cohort of patients for such a trial, as opposite results were
obtained as functions of age and type of SMA. As such,
no ﬁnal conclusion was made concerning VPA, but it was
suggested that additional controlled clinical trials with VPA
targeting more restricted cohorts of subjects were needed
[72].
A phase II clinical trial, principally investigating the
eﬀect of glyceryl trinitrate, and incidentally that of VPA,
on pain caused by diabetic peripheral neuropathy, showed
that these two molecules induce signiﬁcant improvement,
whether used alone or in combination [73]. This study,
undertaken upon 83 patients divided into four groups,
compared visual analogue score (VAS) and present pain
intensity (PPI) at the beginning of the study and after
three months, with motor and sensory nerve conduction
velocities measured using electrophysiological tests. These
results show signiﬁcant improvements with both drugs indi-
vidually and in combination, except for electrophysiological
test results with VPA treatment, which show no signiﬁcant
modiﬁcation.
Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a cutaneous tumor caused by
Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) and is often associated
with coinfection by HIV (AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma),
especially in African populations. Valproate stimulates HIV
replication in some HIV-infected cell lines in culture [74, 75],
and in the case of HHV8-infected cells, valproate induces
expression of multiple HHV8-encoded transcripts that are
associated with entry into the lytic phase of replication [76].
Because valproate is sometimes used in individuals who
might be infected with HHV8 and HIV, a recent study aimed
to identify the eﬀect of VPA in cases of AIDS-associated
Kaposi sarcoma [77]. Their results show that treatment with
VPA was associated with low toxicity, and that KS clinical
response and herpesvirus lytic induction were not high
enough to be associated with signiﬁcant induction of virus
replication.
The clinical trials mentioned to date concerning treat-
ment of nonmalignant diseases show few real beneﬁts
associated with use of VPA in mono- or polytreatment, and
this despite the very encouraging preclinical data obtained so
far.

4.2.1. VPA in Myeloid and Lymphoid Malignancies. The use
of VPA in monotherapy or polytherapy seems promising for
leukemia diseases. It has already been established that VPA
exerts diﬀerent eﬀects in diﬀerent cell types, and probably in
the function of these cell types. It can induce proliferation
in early stem cells and can inhibit angiogenesis, production
of TNF-α and IL-6, and activation of NF-κB. Taken together
these properties could be beneﬁcial in the treatment of MDS
or leukemic pathologies.
While HDACi are emerging as valuable new agents in the
treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the eﬃciency
rates of these compounds in isolation are low, which requires
them to be used in cotreatment with other anticancer
drugs. Research into predictive markers of the eﬃciency
of cotreatment with VPA gave rise to a study published
in 2009, comparing results obtained by coprocessing using
all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and theophylline on 20
patients and several cell lines, and a microarray study on
primary AML cells and cell lines. Comparison between
results obtained with cotreatment (one Complete Remission
(CR), two Partial Remission (PR)) and those obtained in
treatment of primary cells and cell lines allowed the authors
to conclude that similar factors determine both in vivo and in
vitro sensitivity and identiﬁed elevated FOSB-expression as a
potential marker of VPA sensitivity [78].
Hematological improvement was reported in many
patients with diﬀerent types of cancer following VPA
treatment, with favorable responses; in patients with MDS
(myelodystrophy syndromes) and MPS (myeloproliferative
syndromes) [79]; in patients with AML developed from
MPD (myeloproliferative disorders) [80]; in patients with
myeloﬁbrosis in myeloid metaplasia [81]. Clinical studies on
the use of VPA have shown the beneﬁcial eﬀect of this drug
especially on MDS [82, 83].
In 2007, a phase I/II study investigated the use of a
tritherapy combination of 5-azacitidine (5-AZA), VPA, and
ATRA in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or high-
risk MDS. A total of 53 patients were treated with an age
range of 5–84 years, and median age of 69 years. Maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) for VPA was 50 mg/kg daily for 7
days, and toxicity consisted of reversible neurotoxicity. The
overall response rate was 42% and was 52% for previously
untreated older patients. This tritherapy combination is safe
and presents signiﬁcant clinical activity [84].
Another group studied whether VPA is active against
myeloid leukemia in a polytherapy treatment associating
VPA and ATRA, on 26 patients with low risk AML. The
results showed that for the 19 patients with AML arising from
MPD who completed four weeks of treatment, no CR was
observed, one minor HI, and two PR in patients.
A recent phase II clinical study targeted 62 patients with
high risk MDS, treated with a combination of 5-AZA and
VPA. It showed that for the 26 patients who completed the
eight cycles, 30.7% obtained complete or partial remission
(CR or PR), 15.4% had major hematologic improvement
(HI), whereas 38.5% showed stable disease (SD) [85]. VPA
increased 5-azacytidine eﬃciency, and the study concluded
that 5-AZA/VPA combined treatment is eﬀective for patients
with MDS with a poor prognosis.
The ﬁrst results on the use of VPA in lymphoid
diseases, made through a study of microarrays, are very
encouraging, showing that this molecule is capable of
8 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology
inducing apoptosis through repression of several antiapop-
totic genes and induction of proapoptotic genes. More-
over, VPA signiﬁcantly increased sensitivity to ﬂudarabine,
ﬂavopiridol, bortezomib, thalidomide, and lenalidomide
[86].
4.2.2. VPA in Solid Tumors. VPA shows potent antitumor
eﬀect in a wide variety of cancers in preclinical studies, in
vitro and in vivo, by modulating multiple pathways including
cell cycle arrest, angiogenesis, apoptosis, diﬀerentiation, and
senescence. These eﬀects appear to be cell type-speciﬁc and
could be dependent upon the degree of diﬀerentiation and,
in the case of cancer, dependent upon the degree of alteration
[87]. The majority of preclinical studies concerning the
antitumoral eﬀects of VPA were performed on myeloid
or lymphoid leukemia. However, for solid tumors, some
preclinical studies have provided interesting results. In
2008, Duenas-Gonzalez et al. [87] summarized the state of
preclinical data and positive eﬀects of VPA on 19 diﬀerent
types of solid cancer. In ﬁbrosarcoma, cotreatment with
VPA strongly increased the eﬃciency of hydralazin, and
was able to eliminate residual disease tissue after surgery
or treatment in xenograft models [88]. In bladder cancer,
VPA inhibits growth of tumor xenografts [89]. In prostate
cancer, VPA induces apoptosis in androgen-dependent and
independent cell lines [90], and a growth inhibitory eﬀect
was also observed in xenograft models [90, 91]. For colon
cancer, VPA signiﬁcantly induces apoptosis in some cell
lines which express APC [92], with similar results observed
in primary colon cancer cells [93]. For breast cancer,
VPA inhibits growth of cell lines independent of estrogen
receptors [94, 95], potentiates the action of Tamoxifen,
Raloxifen, Fulvestran, and Letrozol, and induces tumor
regression in xenograft. Surprisingly, combined treatment
with VPA and tamoxifen inhibits Ishikawa adenocarcinoma
cells, which normally proliferate in response to tamoxifen
[96]. In hepatocarcinoma cells, VPA increases cell death in
cell lines and primary cancerous cells through the induction
of TRAIL in TRAIL-sensitive cells (Figure 2), and through c-
FLIP inhibition in TRAIL-resistant cells [97]. Treatment of
neuroblastoma cells with VPA inhibits growth and induces
neural diﬀerentiation [98]; in xenograft, VPA inhibits tumor
growth by itself, but when associated with IFN-alpha can
induce complete cure (33% of tested animals) [99]. VPA
induces cell diﬀerentiation and adhesiveness in glioma cells
[100]; it potentiates the action of etoposide for the induction
of apoptosis in these cancer cell types [101]. In Thyroid can-
cer, VPA acts upon both poorly diﬀerentiated, and anaplastic
cells, by inducing proliferative and proapoptotic eﬀects
through inhibition of BCL-2 and BCL-xl, and induction of
Bax [102].
A dose escalating phase I clinical trial, realized in 2007,
targeted refractory advanced solid tumors in 26 pretreated
patients and gave the ﬁrst indication of the eﬀect of VPA
treatment maximum tolerated dose (MDT). Doses of up
to 60 mg/kg/d for 5 consecutive days were well tolerated
and showed detectable biological activity; doses of 90
to 120 mg/kg/d corresponded to the incidence of dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT), dominated mainly by neurocognitive
impairment, with grade 3 or 4 neurological side eﬀects
occurring in 8 out of 26 patients. No grade 3 or 4
hematological toxicity was observed [103].
Concerning clinical trials upon breast cancer, initial
results showed that cotreatment with hydralazine and mag-
nesium valproate exerts the proposed molecular eﬀects of
DNA demethylation, HDAC inhibition, and gene reactiva-
tion in primary tumors [104]. Recently a phase I/II study
was conducted to study the eﬀects of valproic acid in patients
with breast cancer [105]. This study, which focused on the
HDACi eﬀect of VPA, was based on 44 patients with phase I
cancer who had solid tumors and adequate organ function.
The phase II dose expansion enrolled 15 patients with locally
advanced (III), or metastatic (IV), breast cancer. Partial
responses for 9 of 41 (22%) patients within the phase I
cohort, and objective responses for 9 of 14 (64%) patients
in the phase II cohort, demonstrated that valproic acid is
clinically relevant regarding its HDAC inhibition activity in
solid tumor malignancy. This study, which also investigated
markers of HDACi eﬃcacy, proposed that eﬃciency should
be checked using peripheral blood rather than the tumor,
and that the activity of HDAC2 should be targeted.
A recent phase I/II clinical trial aimed to examine the
capacity of VPA to potentiate the eﬀect of karenitecin (KTN:
a topo I inhibitor) on melanoma cells. The previous studies in
multiple melanoma cell lines, and in mouse A375 xenografts,
had been conducted and showed that VPA pretreatment
potentiated KTN-induced apoptosis. This clinical study,
realized in patients with stage IV melanoma, with any num-
ber of prior therapies, aimed to investigate DNA cleavage,
cytotoxicity, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) induced
by KTN and VPA. Encouraging results were shown for a VPA
MTD of 75 mg/kg/d (1.28 mmol/L), in which 15 patients
were evaluated for toxicity and eﬃciency; 47% (7 of 15) of
patients with metastatic poor prognosis melanoma showed
disease stabilization [106]. In comparison, another stage I/II
clinical trial aimed to evaluate the biological activity of VPA,
following cotreatment with standard chemoimmunotherapy
(dacarbazine, 800 mg/m2 plus Interferon-α) for advanced
melanoma patients. 29 patients were eligible and started
taking valproate, 18 received chemoimmunotherapy and
were assessed for response. Results showed only one com-
plete response, two partial remissions, and three disease
stabilizations lasting longer than 24 weeks and triggered an
increase in side eﬀects. In conclusion, VPA treatment did
not produce results superior to standard therapy in patients
with advanced melanoma and induced severe side eﬀects
with grade 3 (anemia, abdominal pain, ataxia, neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia, hypocalcemia, depression consciousness,
neurological disorder, and urinary incontinence) and grade
4 (Dyspnea, anemia, depression consciousness, neurological
disorder thrombocytopenia, and cerebral hemorrhage) toxi-
cities [107].
The use of orally administered VPA in a clinical trial tar-
geting castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) showed
that two out of ten patients had prostate-speciﬁc antigen
(PSA) responses, of which only one response was durable.
Weekly biomarker collections revealed PSA levels inversely
correlated with total VPA levels, but no histone acetylation
Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology 9
was consistently observed in peripheral lymphocytes. VPA
toxicity eﬀects were grades 1 and 2 for neurologic events, and
grades 1 and 2 for fatigue [108]. This study concluded that
it was unlikely that the observed eﬀects upon PSA were due
to the HDACi activity of VPA, and as such oral-VPA is not
recommended to treat prostate cancer.
In conclusion, VPA has been used for many years in
the treatment of many neurological disorders including
convulsive seizures related to epilepsy, as a mood stabilizer
and in the treatment of schizophrenia. Moreover, VPA has
been involved in clinical trials for several other neural
disorders or diseases, such as addiction, migraine, and ALS.
Accordingly, investigation of side eﬀects will be crucial for
the future use of this drug.
5. Drug’s Interactions
To date a total of 606 drugs are known to interact
with VPA, 12 major, 546 moderate, and 48 minor inter-
actions (http://www.drugs.com/). The major drug inter-
actions are with acetaminophen, aspirin/caﬀeine, cilas-
tatin/imipenem, doripenem, ertapenem, lamotrigine, mero-
penem, propoxyphen, sodium benzoate, sodium oxybate,
sodium phenylacetate, and vorinostat.
Aspirin, caﬀeine, and other salicylates can inhibit the
clearance of valproic acid and increasing its serum-free
concentration up to 4 times [109], this may help to reduce
the daily dose of VPA but also increase its cytotoxicity when
administered with aspirin [110]. Imipenem, Meropenem,
Doripenem, Ertapenem, and Panipenem antibiotics decrease
the serum concentrations of valproic acid likely by increasing
the metabolism of VPA to VPA glucuronide as well as
the renal clearance of VPA glucuronide and by inhibiting
the intestinal absorption of VPA [111, 112]. Valproic acid
has been shown to signiﬁcantly increase the plasma con-
centrations of lamotrigine (doubling the half-life) [113–
115] potentially leading to serious and life-threatening rash,
including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal
necrolysis, but also disabling tremors and ataxia, known as
secondary eﬀects of lamotrigine [116, 117]. Propoxyphene
interaction with VPA is associated with an increasing
probability of hip fracture by 60% in the elderly, presumably
due to additive psychomotor impairment [118]. Moreover,
as reported in several medical websites, propoxyphene
could induce additive CNS- or respiratory-depressant eﬀects
and cause drug-related deaths particularly when used with
VPA, in patients with emotional disturbances or addiction.
Administration of valproic acid diminishes the therapeutic
eﬀects of sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate in the
treatment of acute hyperammonemia due to deﬁciencies in
enzymes of the urea cycle (see Side-eﬀects chapter) [119–
121]. The therapeutic action on central nervous system and
respiratory of sodium oxybate (gamma-Hydroxybutyrate,
GHB) can be potentially increased by other CNS-depressants
which includes the VPA, but short-chain monocarboxylic
acids and medium-chain fatty acids signiﬁcantly inhibited
in a competitive manner GHB brain-inﬂux by 35 to 90%
[122] which leads to the decrease of the eﬀect of this
molecule. Coadministration of VPA (and other HDACi)
with vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, SAHA)
can severely aggravate thrombocytopenia and gastrointesti-
nal bleeding induced by the treatment with SAHA [123,
124].
6. Side Effects of VPA
Valproic acid (VPA) is generally used as a ﬁrst-line anticon-
vulsive agent. It is currently in clinical trials for treatments
in many ﬁelds, such as neurological disorders, cancer
treatments and addictions, or as an antiviral complement.
However, as with many antiepileptic drugs, there are a
number of consequences associated with the use of VPA.
Many side eﬀects related to clinical use of VPA have
been reported in the literature. Most of them describe its
mild and transient side eﬀects on patients [125] but also
its serious eﬀects on embryonic development that results in
physical and cognitive alterations. However, it is quite rarely
made reference to other side eﬀects that can cause signiﬁcant
disorders or even death of patients (Table 2).
6.1. Speciﬁc Mild Side Eﬀects of VPA to Young Patients. Several
mild side eﬀects have been reported in patients treated
with VPA, during or after the end of treatment. In one
study, parents reported an increase in sleep duration during
VPA treatment on young patients. However, this study—
based upon sleep duration and its changes during, and
up to 8 weeks after the end of treatment—[126] showed
that after recalibration of sleep as a function of age, it was
the cessation of VPA treatment that induced a decrease
in sleep time. This was at a mild level for most patients,
but considerable in a subgroup of children, especially the
youngest. It also appears that VPA played a role in daytime
sleepiness.
VPA has also been associated with weight gain and with
changes in serum triglycerides, cholesterol, and fast glucose,
but studies into these eﬀects have shown only slight impacts
of treatment upon weight gain in young children or teenagers
[127, 128]. Body mass index scores tend to increase during
the ﬁrst 16 months of treatment and then tend to stabilize,
resulting in an increase in the proportion of young children
in the clinically overweight category from 6.9% to 16%. In
older children, there was a 14% change to a higher weight
category. However, the overall results showed no signiﬁcant
variation in the composition of fatty acids in serum.
6.2. Dermatologic Side Eﬀects. Valproic acid can be associated
with cases of stomatitis, cutaneous leukoclastic vasculitis,
and psoriasiform eruption [141]. Valproic acid induced
alopecia due to the telogen shedding which appears within
three months of the initiation of the treatment. It induces
also transient alopecia (2.6% to 12%), thinning of the hair,
hair color changes, hair texture changes, and rare rashes.
Alopecia is not dose related and can be prevented by
treatment with zinc and selenium-containing vitamin. VPA
was also implicated in Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic
epidermal necrolysis (Lyell Syndrom) [142].

6.3. VPA Eﬀects on Fertility, Pregnancy and Fetus Develop-
ment. The inﬂuence of VPA upon murine fertility, and that
of the descendants, has been well reported: VPA decreases
the fertility index by 25% and decreases the number of
fetuses. To a large degree, these side eﬀects can be corrected
by administration of folic acid, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate
(FOL), and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) [129], indicating
the eﬀect of VPA on the folic acid cycle.
Prospective and retrospective studies demonstrate that
VPA is a human teratogen, with an approximately threefold
increase in major anomalies [131, 132], which is greater
than that observed for other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).
Comparative studies show that while other AEDs increase
the risk of malformation from 2.9 to 3.6%, the risk of major
congenital malformation obtained with VPA is between 6.2
and 7.6% [143]. These disorders usually comprise spina
biﬁda, and more rarely anencephaly, cardiac, craniofacial
skeletal or limb defects, dysmorphic features, and a decrease
in intrauterine growth (Valproate syndrome) [130]. More-
over, children aﬀected by Valproate Syndrome generally
present developmental or communication problems, such as
autistic spectrum disorder or decreased verbal intelligence
[132]. The increased rate of disorders could be linked with
taking more than 1000 mg daily, or linked with polytherapy.
Therefore, pregnant women treated with VPA, and without
the possibility of substitution treatment, are recommended
to decrease dosage by 2 to 3 daily doses, limit treatment to
monotherapy and, in addition, to take folic acid and increase
the frequency of ultrasonographic assessments to assess any
malformations more precisely. It has been suggested that
the teratogenic eﬀects of VPA could be due to impaired
methionine synthesis and DNA hypomethylation [144],
as VPA induces disturbance of the folic acid cycle and
subsequent synthesis of methionine [129]. It can also be due
Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology 11
to the increase in oxidative stress, to which the brain is more
susceptible than the other fetal organs [132].
Finally, the eﬀects of VPA may also have impact on
the child’s intellectual development, without description of
malformation, autism syndrome, or problems in communi-
cation. Recent interesting publications aim to quantify the
IQ of oﬀ-spring of women taking VPA or other AEDs during
pregnancy. It follows from this study on more than 300
children, that exposure to AEDs (Lamotrigine, Phenytoin,
Carbamazepine and Valproic acid) during pregnancy can
impair brain development of children. This phenomenon
is particularly important with VPA, causing a signiﬁcant
decrease in IQ by 9 points on average, irrespective of
maternal IQ [133, 134]. These results show also that the
decrease is dose dependant.
6.4. Neurological Side Eﬀect of Treatment with VPA. VPA
has been used for many years as an anticonvulsant and
antiepileptic drug. In the recent years, it has been associated
with treatment or clinical trials for other neurological dis-
orders, such as mood disorders, schizophrenia, or attention
deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder. Due to its direct neurological
action, it is not surprising to see the emergence of side eﬀects
in the same ﬁeld.
One report described 19 new cases of encephalopathy
in 2006 in Germany that possibly implicate valproic acid
[120]. These cases are in addition to the 51 cases previously
described in the literature. While it had been previously
reported that these side eﬀects were visible only in children
with metabolic defects, the new results reveal that the
same eﬀects are found in adult patients. In these cases of
encephalopathy, a possible direct action of VPA upon neu-
rotransmitters has been postulated, which would explain the
emergence of the pathology in the absence of liver failure or
hyperammonemia [145], and in cases of hyperammonemia,
VPA could inhibit the urea cycle.
Valproate-induced Parkinsonism was recently described
in the literature. Tested among several EADs, the VPA has
shown the greatest ability to induce Parkinsonian symptoms,
increasing the population tested from 0 to 5.04% [137]. They
show that the eﬀects are reversible and can be controled
by a decrease of the dose. Moreover, they also reported
that the symptoms can appear from a dose of 750 ±
273.86 mg/day in long-term treatment (all patients have
been taking VPA for more than 3 years). Three years
earlier, Easterford et al. presented the same results, with
an incidence corresponding to a 10 times increase of the
symptoms, but suggesting that dopaminergic neuronal loss
is not the underlying mechanism, since beta-CIT-SPECT
scans showed normal results [146]. Nevertheless, short-
time treatment showed also signiﬁcant incidence. After
one year of treatment a signiﬁcant increase up to 1.37%
of parkinsonism or cognitive decline (P/CD) induced by
VPA was reported [147]. Finally, one patient with short-
term Valproate-induced Parkinsonism (3 months) has been
described in [148]. In this case, the authors hypothesized
that valproic acid acts through damage of the protoplasmic
astrocytes and the decrease of the number of glioﬁlaments.
Hyperammonia is a pathology generally associated with
liver failure. In patients treated by VPA, hyperammonia was
observed in the absence of liver failure [121], resulting in
vomiting, ataxia, behavioral changes, lethargy, somnolence,
or coma. However, it seems that the majority of VPA-
induced hyperammonia cases in children are asymptomatic
and can be detected only by blood tests or psychomotor
speed, reaction time, and memory assessment. It should
be noted that long-term hyperammonemia can induce
encephalopathy.
In a recent study, VPA was involved in an acute ischemic
stroke in a patient with a mutation of methylenetetrahy-
drofollate reductase (MTHFR) 677C/T [135]. The rate of
this mutation, that varies from 5 to 22% of the population,
results in a decrease in MHTFR activity from 70% to
30%, for homozygotes and heterozygotes, respectively, which
induces hyperhomocysteinemia (Hcy), a possible risk factor
for epilepsy and occlusive vascular disease. It had already
been reported that Hcy could be exacerbated by the use of
VPA, by reducing folic acid and Vitamin B12 levels. This
study highlights the risks associated with VPA treatment for
this pathology and recommends taking into account family
epilepsy history to determine the level of Hcy, particularly in
the case of long-term treatment, in order to promote patient
survival.
While the eﬀectiveness of VPA is recognized in the
treatment of epilepsy, including cases of Juvenile absence
epilepsy, little is known about the paradoxical eﬀects that this
molecule can have, for instance, the exacerbation of these
disorders. This rare phenomenon was described in 2007 for
a young patient [136].
6.5. Association between VPA and Liver Damage. For a long
time, it has been shown that hepatotoxicity induced by VPA
is greatest in children under 2 years old undergoing polyther-
apies [138, 139, 149]. The prevalence of hepatotoxicity is 1
per 618 for this age bracket and decreases to 1 per 10,100
for ages 11 to 20 years. Exposure of the liver to the VPA
degradation product is the most likely explanation for cases
of hepatotoxicity observed during treatment, particularly
for young children. The VPA degradation product (E)-2,4-
diene VPA, and two conjugation forms with glutathione as
N-acethylcystein (NAC) conjugated, NAC1 and NAC2 for
excretion in urine, seem to be the main factors causing the
disease [150]. A statistical study, conducted in 2003 [151],
on groups of young patients treated with VPA in mono- or
polytherapy type A or B, shows a clear correlation between
age, dose, and quantity of conjugate found in patient’s
urine, with an increased excretion with decreasing age, and
a pronounced eﬀect between 0 and 7.5 years. This study also
shows the lack of eﬀect of type A polytherapy (non-P450-
enzyme inducer), in comparison with the monotherapies.
However, type B polytherapy (P450-enzyme inducer), which
increases the metabolism of VPA, and thus increases its
clearance, induces a signiﬁcant increase in the excretion of
NAC.
There is a correlation between ages, treatment, and
amount of conjugate excreted, the latter reﬂecting exposure
12 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology
of the liver to VPA degradation products. This correla-
tion may be predictive, as it is possible, using gas chro-
matography coupled with mass spectrometry, to determine
dosage quantities precisely: using these two indices could
be the most promising indicator for prediction of this side
eﬀect.
6.6. VPA and Hematological Disorders. Coagulopathies were
described in children treated with VPA [123]. More than
4% of children treated with VPA demonstrate this pathol-
ogy, but this is likely to be a signiﬁcant underestimate.
Symptoms found in this disorder are thrombocytopenia,
platelet dysfunction, Von Wilbrant disease, Factor XIII
deﬁciency, hypoﬁbrinogenemia, and vitamin K-dependent
factor deﬁciency.
Two hypotheses could explain the thrombopenia and
platelet dysfunction. The ﬁrst is that VPA has a direct
toxicity on bone marrow, which decreases production of
neutrophilic and erythroic marrow. The second hypothesis
involves the inclusion of VPA into the platelet membrane
(structural and chemical similarity with the fatty acids of
cell membranes). This membrane modiﬁcation could cause
autoimmunity, due to the production of immunogobin
M antibody directed against circulating thrombocytes, but
this modiﬁcation could also cause simple alteration of
membrane properties, which could explain the observation
of thrombocytopenia without decrease in platelet number.
VPA-induced von-Willebrand disease has been reported as
having a high prevalence (around 67% in children during
VPA treatment, and 16% for adult patients). The mechanism
inducing the pathology has not been elucidated, but vWF
is downregulated, without dose eﬀect correlation, and the
pathology is reversible following treatment, or can be cor-
rected by desmopressin. Vitamin K-dependent coagulopathy
induced by VPA could imply a competitive mechanism
between the two molecules for binding sites in plasma—as
unbound Vitamin K has a shorter half-life—or in one of the
many metabolic pathways shared by these molecules. VPA-
associated hypoﬁbrinogenemia does not appear to have a
major inﬂuence in coagulopathy but is always associated with
a more important pathology, as described previously, and
is probably involved in an as yet unknown step in hepatic
synthesis. VPA-associated factor XIII deﬁciency has been
described in a few patients, with the involvement of VPA not
in doubt, because of recovery after treatment and the rarity
of double mutation. No explanation has yet been advanced
to explain the phenomenon, but the inﬂuence of VPA in the
synthesis of other liver factors has been reported on several
occasions.
A second side eﬀect of blood type, after the use of VPA
(or other antiepileptic drugs such as carbamazepine and
phenytoin), is the development of aplastic anemia [140],
for which prevalence appears to be increased by more than
9 times. Just as it has been reported for hepatotoxicity,
it appears that aplastic anemia has a higher prevalence
during polytherapy. However, given that aplastic anemia
is a malfunction of hematopoietic stem cells, inducing a
break in the production of erythrocytes, the results reported
in this study contradict those which suggest VPA as a
potent activator of erythropoiesis in epileptic patients [152].
This study of 30 young patients treated for more than 3
months with VPA anticonvulsive doses shows an increase
of the expression of fetal hemoglobin, with dose-dependent
stimulation.
7. Conclusion
VPA is a molecule exhibiting a wide range of eﬀects
upon various tissues, pathologies, and patient proﬁles. This
molecule is capable of altering the expression of more than
20% of the transcriptome in a tissue-dependent manner.
Therefore, it is currently very diﬃcult to anticipate all
the eﬀects that may occur during treatments in mono- or
polytherapies.
On one hand, VPA has been used for many years in
the treatment of convulsive seizures related to epilepsy, as
a mood stabilizer and in the treatment of schizophrenia.
More recently, VPA has been involved in clinical trials for
several other neural disorders or diseases, such as addiction,
migraine, and ALS. Its eﬃciency in the treatment of cerebral
alterations is the most described.
On the other hand, modifying the expression of onco-
genes or anti-oncogenes could be a proﬁtable strategy in the
ﬁght against various forms of cancer. In this regard, VPA
appears to have some undeniable qualities, such as the induc-
tion of cell death (mainly by apoptosis) and diﬀerentiation,
and the inhibition of proliferation. Interestingly, it seems that
healthy cells are much less sensitive to these properties.
In light of all these observations and considering the
increase of clinical trials involving VPA, it is highly likely
that this molecule will be used in many therapies in the
near future. Nevertheless, numerous publications related to
therapeutic eﬀects of VPA also mention possible side eﬀects
associated with treatments. Thus a variety of side eﬀects,
including coagulopathies, aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity,
and teratogenic eﬀects have been reported. Some preexist-
ing pathologies such as hyperhomocysteinemia or coagu-
lopathy and pregnancy contraindicate the use of VPA as
a treatment.
Balancing therapeutic potentialities with serious side
eﬀects observed following use of VPA to favor the advan-
tageous eﬀects will no doubt prove to be a challenging and
complex issue for clinical management.
