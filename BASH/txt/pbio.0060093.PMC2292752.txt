Polycomb group proteins are transcriptional repressors that play a central role in the establishment and maintenance
of gene expression patterns during development. Using mice with an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutation in
Suppressor of Zeste 12 (Suz12), a core component of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), we show here that loss of
Suz12 function enhances hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) activity. In addition to these effects on a wild-type genetic
background, mutations in Suz12 are sufficient to ameliorate the stem cell defect and thrombocytopenia present in mice
that lack the thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl). To investigate the molecular targets of the PRC2 complex in the HSC
compartment, we examined changes in global patterns of gene expression in cells deficient in Suz12. We identified a
distinct set of genes that are regulated by Suz12 in hematopoietic cells, including eight genes that appear to be highly
responsive to PRC2 function within this compartment. These data suggest that PRC2 is required to maintain a specific
gene expression pattern in hematopoiesis that is indispensable to normal stem cell function.

Introduction
Suppressor of Zeste 12 (Suz12) was identiﬁed in a genetic
screen performed in Drosophila to deﬁne transcriptional
repressors [1]. Biochemical studies subsequently identiﬁed
Suz12 as a component of a multimeric protein complex,
termed Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is
responsible for di- and tri-methylation of histone 3 at lysine
27 (H3K27) [2–5]. The core components of PRC2 are
conserved between ﬂy and vertebrates; in addition to Suz12,
they include the methyl-transferase Enhancer of Zeste 2
(Ezh2) and various forms of the Embryonic Ectoderm
Development protein (Eed) (reviewed in [6]). Genome-wide
location analysis—performed in mouse, human, and ﬂy—
conﬁrmed that PRC2 components and tri-methylated H3K27
(H3K27-3Me) are enriched within the promoters of tran-
scriptionally repressed genes [7–14]. Disruption of the
complex has profound consequences during development
and in human disease, which illustrates the important role
epigenetic marks play in maintaining appropriate patterns of
gene expression.
Many insights into the mechanism of PRC2 action have
come from studies focused on its role in Homeobox gene
repression in Drosophila. Work with the Ultrabithorax promoter
demonstrated that repression mediated by PRC2 involves the
recruitment of a distinct Polycomb complex, termed Poly-
comb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) [2,5]. Later studies
conﬁrmed that the Drosophila protein Polycomb (Pc), a core
component of PRC1, binds with high afﬁnity to H3K27-3Me
via its chromodomain [15,16]. Because H3K27 methylation is
performed by PRC2, these ﬁndings suggested a hierarchical
relationship between the two complexes, in which PRC2
initiates silencing by targeting PRC1 to speciﬁc regions of
chromatin (reviewed in [6]). The relationship between PRC2
and PRC1 is further complicated in vertebrates where many
Polycomb group homologs are present [17]. Indeed, the
hierarchy amongst distinct Polycomb group complexes and
their dynamic composition and interaction in physiological
processes, such as X-inactivation, remain incompletely
understood [18]. Newly identiﬁed links between PRC2 and
other epigenetic regulators, such as DNA methyl-transferase
and noncoding RNA molecules (ncRNA), suggest that PRC2
coordinates a variety of processes that function in concert to
initiate and maintain the repressive chromatin state [19,20].
Given that PRC2 regulates numerous target genes, it is
perhaps not surprising that disruption of the complex has
major implications during the early stages of development,
where the correct temporal and spatial control of gene
expression is critical. Murine models of PRC2 deﬁciency have
demonstrated that each component is absolutely required for
embryonic development [21–23]. The analysis of embryos that
lack PRC2 components has revealed deﬁciencies at implanta-
tion and early post-implantation stages in development,
which is consistent with the involvement of PRC2 in pathways
that inﬂuence cellular proliferation [24–26]. Further inves-
tigation of PRC2 function in the adult mouse has been

restricted to the use of conditional alleles, which have been
generated for Ezh2 [27], and viable hypomorphic alleles that
include Eed1989
[21].
The study of Polycomb group proteins in vertebrate
hematopoiesis has largely focused on PRC1 components,
the best-characterised amongst these being Bmi-1. Bmi-1 is a
critical regulator of self-renewal in hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) [28–30] that mediates its effect in part through
control of the Ink4a-Arf locus [29,31,32]. In comparison,
relatively little is known about the activity of PRC2 within the
HSC compartment, although several observations suggest
that perturbation of PRC2 inﬂuences HSC biology. Hypo-
morphic alleles of Eed have demonstrated a critical role for
PRC2 in restricting the proliferation of early lymphoid and
myeloid progenitors [33,34]. In this context, the function of
PRC2 appears to oppose the activity of PRC1; however, the
precise molecular targets that contribute to this phenotype
remain unknown [33]. Proliferative defects have not been
reported in mice that lack Ezh2 within the hematopoietic
compartment, although this ﬁnding may be complicated by
impaired B cell and T cell maturation [27,35]. Further
evidence of a role for PRC2 in the stem cell compartment
has come from the ﬁnding that forced expression of Ezh2
appears to prevent the exhaustion of HSCs during serial
transplantation [36].
Thrombopoietin (Tpo) is the primary regulator of platelet
production in vivo [37,38]. Deletion of the Tpo gene, or the
Tpo receptor (c-Mpl), in mice results in a severe reduction in
platelet count [39–41], and mutations that disrupt the Tpo/c-
Mpl pathway are the major cause of the rare human disorder
congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia [42,43]. Sig-
nalling through c-Mpl also supports the development of long-
term HSCs [44], and impaired signalling through the receptor
is associated with functional deﬁciencies in HSCs and
progenitor cells in both mice and humans [41,45–47]. We
have performed a large-scale ENU mutagenesis screen to
identify mutations that rescue platelet production and HSC
function in c-Mpl–/–
mice. This approach has previously
identiﬁed mutations in c-Myb that result in supra-physiolog-
ical platelet production [48]. Herein we describe the isolation
of a mutation in Suz12, identiﬁed in the platelet 8 (PLT8)
pedigree, which causes a global reduction in the abundance
of PRC2. Impairment of PRC2 in Suz12Plt8/þ
mice caused
changes in steady-state hematopoiesis that were associated
with enhanced HSC and progenitor cell activity.
Results
Genetic Mapping and Identification of the Plt8 Mutation
An ENU mutagenesis screen was performed with c-MplÀ/À
mice to identify mutations that suppress thrombocytopenia
and/or stem cell defects. The average platelet count in c-Mpl–/–
mice is 112 6 78 3 106
/ml (mean 6 standard deviation; n ¼
179). The founder of the PLT8 pedigree was identiﬁed among
a population of G1 animals segregating ENU-induced
mutations due to its unusually high platelet count (361 3
106
/ml), more than three standard deviations above the mean.
The phenotype was found to be heritable and was therefore
likely to be the result of a germline ENU-induced mutation.
The Plt8 mutation was generated on a C57BL/6 background
and, for the purposes of mapping, was crossed to 129/Sv to
generate C57BL/6:129/Sv F1 animals. F1 animals with an
elevated platelet count (the PLT8 phenotype) were inter-
crossed to produce an F2 population for positional cloning.
Initial results from the genome-wide scan localised the
mutation to a 6.5-Mb interval on Chromosome 11, between
D11MIT245 and D11MIT120. There was a reduced frequency
of C57BL/6 homozygosity at this position—below the ex-
pected frequency of 25%—which suggested the presence of a
mutation that was lethal when homozygous (Figure 1A, at
left). Analysis of the peripheral blood demonstrated that mice
that carried C57BL/6 DNA at this position (as heterozygotes)
had a higher mean platelet count when compared to mice
that were 129/Sv homozygotes, or to a control F2 population,
which suggested that this region harboured the Plt8 mutation
(Figure 1A, at right). Additional microsatellite markers were
used to reﬁne the Plt8 candidate interval. An additional 531
PLT8 F2 mice were genotyped, and the candidate interval was
reduced to 1.4 Mb between D11CAR28 and D11CAR48 (from
base pair 79314902 to 80704402) (Figure 1B).
We sequenced the exons and splice sites of six genes within
the candidate interval: Suppressor of Zeste 12 (Suz12), Cytokine
receptor-like factor 3, Ring ﬁnger protein 135, Rhomboid veinlet-like
protein 4, Zinc ﬁnger protein 207, and Cyclin-dependent kinase 5
activator 1 precursor. A single base pair deletion was identiﬁed
in a splice acceptor site of the 16th exon of Suz12 (Figure 1C).
The Plt8 mutation was present in all affected PLT8 animals
and was not identiﬁed in wild-type littermates, or other
available mouse strains that included 129/Sv, C3H, and Balb/c.

Fails to Complement a Null Allele of Suz12
A complementation test was performed to verify that the
Plt8 mutation impairs the functional activity of Suz12. Mice
heterozygous for the Plt8 mutation (Suz12Plt8/þ
) were mated to
micethatcarriedaloss-of-functiongenetrapallele(Suz12502gt/þ
)
to generate compound heterozygotes. The genetrap allele,
herein referred to as Suz12502gt
, has been characterised
previously and shown to impair Suz12 function [23]. No
compound heterozygotes (Suz12Plt8/502gt
) were identiﬁed from

Suz12 in Hematopoiesis
Author Summary
The chromatin environment that surrounds a gene heavily
influences the gene’s transcriptional activity. Specific modifications
on histone tails serve as signposts for the basal transcriptional
machinery, reflecting a cell’s developmental history and identifying
genes that should be actively transcribed and those that must be
repressed. Polycomb group proteins are involved in large, multi-
protein complexes that catalyse the post-translational modification
of histones. The disruption of these complexes induces wholesale
changes in gene expression, a scenario commonly seen in diseases
such as cancer. We have investigated the role of Polycomb group
proteins during blood cell formation: in stem cells, progenitor cells,
and mature blood cells. Using a variety of functional assays, we
demonstrate an important role for Polycomb group proteins in
restricting the activity of hematopoietic stem cells. To define the
molecular targets of the complex, we examined gene expression
profiles in cells with impaired expression of Polycomb group
proteins. This analysis identified a set of target genes within the
hematopoietic compartment that was distinct from those defined in
embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts. This study provides new
insights into the role of these proteins during hematopoiesis, and
suggests a novel mechanism by which they might contribute to
leukaemia.
100 pups analysed (Table S1, chi squared p-value ¼ 2.50 3
10À7
), which indicated that Suz12Plt8/502gt
mice die prior to
weaning. Pasini and colleagues previously demonstrated that
Suz12502gt/502gt
embryos die approximately 8 d after fertiliza-
tion [23]. Similarly, embryos homozygous for the Plt8
mutation were reduced in number at embryonic day 8.5
(E8.5) and were smaller than wild-type and heterozygous
embryos (unpublished data). These results strongly suggest
that the Plt8 mutation impairs Suz12 function.
The Plt8 Mutation Impairs Suz12 mRNA Processing and
Protein Production
Suz12 mRNA and protein were analysed to determine the
mechanism by which the Plt8 mutation affects Suz12
function. Consistent with a deletion in the splice acceptor
site of exon 16, an analysis of Suz12 mRNA by reverse-
transcriptase (RT)-PCR demonstrated aberrant splicing of the
Suz12 transcript in mice that carry the Plt8 mutation (Figure
2A). A longer Suz12 transcript was evident in cDNA from
bone marrow and spleen of these mice, and DNA sequencing
conﬁrmed that the longer mRNA resulted from inappropri-
ate inclusion of the 15th intron within the mature transcript.
Inclusion of the 15th intron introduces a stop codon that is
predicted to truncate 115 amino acids at the C terminus of
the protein (Suz12DC115).
Suz12 protein levels were reduced in lysates prepared from
Suz12Plt8/þ
embryos. There was no evidence of the predicted
truncation product Suz12DC115 (Figure 2B), despite the fact
that the anti-Suz12 antibody could detect the truncated
protein when it was expressed exogenously in transfected
ﬁbroblasts (Figure S1). Ezh2 protein levels were also lower in
Suz12Plt8/þ
embryos (Figure 2B), a ﬁnding consistent with
previous reports that Suz12 inﬂuences the stability of other
PRC2 components [23]. Impaired production of Suz12 and
Ezh2 had only a modest effect on the total amount of H3K27-
3Me in mutant embryos. Similar changes were evident in
Figure 1. Genetic Mapping and Identification of the Plt8 Mutation
(A) 90 PLT8 F2 mice were genotyped with polymorphic microsatellite markers spread throughout the genome. The frequency of C57BL/6 homozygosity
is plotted along the length of Chromosome 10 (filled circles) and Chromosome 11 (open circles). No mice were homozygous C57BL/6 across an interval
on Chromosome 11 (arrows). PLT8 F2 mice that carried C57BL/6 DNA (‘þ/–’) at this position had a higher mean platelet count than wildtype mice (a
control F2 population, *p , 0.002) or littermates that were homozygous 129/Sv (‘þ/þ’).
(B) A 1.39-Mb candidate interval was defined between D11CAR28 and D11CAR48 (boxed in red). Genotyping is shown for individual recombinants (top
panel); C57BL/6 homozygosity is represented by open boxes, heterozygous markers are gray and 129/Sv homozygosity is shown in black. A haplotype
map is shown (bottom panel) that defines the same interval using the lethality phenotype; the number of mice with each haplotype is shown at left.
(C) DNA was extracted from PLT8 mice with elevated platelet counts for sequence analysis. A single base pair deletion was identified in heterozygous mice
(Suz12Plt8/þ
) and in homozygous tissue obtained from embryos (Suz12Plt8/Plt8
) (red arrow). The deletion disrupts the splice acceptor site upstream of exon 16.

mutations are to reduce steady state levels of Suz12 protein.
Genetic Impairment of Suz12 Enhances Platelet
Production in c-Mpl–/–
Mice
Analysis of peripheral blood conﬁrmed that Suz12Plt8/þ
c-
Mpl–/–
mice had a signiﬁcantly increased platelet count (252
6 54 3 106
/ml) when compared to Suz12þ/þ
c-Mpl–/–
littermates
(107 6 54 3 106
/ml) (Table 1). Although mildly elevated, the
increase in platelet count in Suz12Plt8/þ
mice on a c-Mplþ/þ
background was not statistically signiﬁcant (Table 1). White
blood cell numbers were also elevated in Suz12Plt8/þ
mice,
independent of the c-Mpl genotype, due to an increased
number of lymphocytes. Platelet volume, red cell count, and
hematocrit were not affected by the Plt8 mutation. Similar
changes were evident in the peripheral blood of mice that
carry the genetrap allele (Suz12502gt
), which conﬁrmed that
the elevation in platelet count was a result of impaired Suz12
function (Table 1). The mixed genetic background of
Suz12502gt/þ
mice is likely to account for variation in the
magnitude of the changes. We also identiﬁed elevated platelet
counts in mice that carried a null allele of Ezh2 (93 6 14 3
106
/ml in Ezh2þ/þ
c-Mpl–/–
mice compared to 152 6 14 3106
/ml
in Ezh2þ/-
c-Mpl–/–
littermates, p ¼ 0.0095) [22], which further
suggests that impairment of PRC2 underlies the phenotypic
changes evident in Suz12Plt8/þ
mice.
Consistent with the elevation in platelet count, megakar-
yocyte numbers were increased in the bone marrow of
Suz12Plt8/þ
c-Mpl–/–
mice, and no signiﬁcant increase was seen
in Suz12Plt8/þ
c-Mplþ/þ
mice (Figure 3A). Histological examina-
tion demonstrated normal megakaryocyte morphology (un-
published data), and no differences in megakaryocyte DNA-
ploidy were evident (Figure 3B).
Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Analysis in Suz12Plt8/þ
Mice
To characterize the hematopoietic progenitor cell com-
partment, in vitro colony assays were performed. Numbers of
progenitor cells responsive to several stimuli appeared
normal in Suz12Plt8/þ
mice (Table 2). Megakaryocyte progen-
itor numbers were slightly elevated in bone marrow and
spleen cultures from Suz12Plt8/þ
c-Mplþ/þ
mice; however, this
difference was not statistically signiﬁcant and was not evident
in mice on a c-Mpl–/–
background (Table 2).
Multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cells can be
quantiﬁed using their propensity to form colonies in the
Figure 2. The Plt8 Mutation Disrupts Production of the Suz12 mRNA and Protein
(A) A schematic representation of part of the Suz12 locus is shown to detail the intron and exon structure (at left). Primers were designed to flank the
site of the mutation (red arrow), and RT-PCR was performed on cDNA prepared from bone marrow. An aberrantly spliced product (asterisk) was
identified in cDNA prepared from Suz12Plt8/þ
mice that was not present in wild type.
(B) Protein lysates were prepared from sex-matched embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) embryos for analysis by Western blotting, which revealed that Suz12
and Ezh2 protein levels were reduced in Suz12Plt8/þ
embryos. Suz12 protein levels appeared equivalent in Suz12Plt8/þ
embryos and embryos
heterozygous for the genetrap allele (Suz12502gt/þ
). Equivalent amounts of protein were run in each lane (20 lg), and histone H3 was used to verify equal
loading. Western blot signal intensity was quantified using a densitometer; results represent the average of two independent experiments expressed as
protein expression in Suz12Plt8/þ
(gray) and Suz12502gt/þ
(black) embryos relative to wild type (white, 100%).

spleen of lethally irradiated mice; these colonies are referred
to as colony-forming units spleen (CFU-S) [49]. In agreement
with previous studies that detailed a reduction in stem cell
function in c-Mpl–/–
mice, these animals show a dramatic
reduction in CFU-S compared with c-Mplþ/þ
mice (Figure 4)
[45]. c-Mpl–/–
mice that carry the Plt8 mutation had a
signiﬁcantly increased number of CFU-S when compared to
Suz12þ/þ
c-Mpl–/–
littermates (Figure 4). This increase was not
observed on a c-Mplþ/þ
background.
Analysis of HSCs in Suz12Plt8/þ
Mice
The number of immunophenotypic HSCs was quantiﬁed to
determine whether the stem cell compartment was expanded
in Suz12Plt8/þ
mice. Consistent with previous reports of
progenitor cell defects, the number of lineage marker negative
(Lin–
), Sca-1þ
, c-Kitþ
(LSK) cells in the bone marrow was
reduced in the absence of c-Mpl (;2-fold, p , 0.001); however,
there was no discernable difference in the total number of
LSK cells between Suz12Plt8/þ
and Suz12þ/þ
mice (Figure 5).
The cell surface proteins CD34 and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3
(Flt3) were used to subdivide the LSK population into long-
term (LT) HSCs, short-term (ST) HSCs, and lymphoid primed
multi-potent progenitors (LMPPs) [50]. c-Mpl–/–
mice exhibit a
marked reduction in the frequency of CD34–
Flt3–
LSK cells,
the population that contains LT-HSCs, which is similar to
results obtained with Tpo–/–
animals [44]. Rather than being
increased, the proportion of CD34–
Flt3–
LSK cells was slightly
lower in Suz12Plt8/þ
mice, and this difference was more
pronounced in c-Mplþ/þ
mice (p , 0.01) (Figure 5B).
The increased frequency of lymphoid-biased progenitors
(CD34þ
Flt3þ
) may explain the elevated production of
peripheral blood lymphocytes in Suz12Plt8/þ
c-Mplþ/þ
mice.

mice by competitive and serial
transplantation of bone marrow into lethally irradiated
recipients (see Materials and Methods). Both platelet and
white blood cell counts were modestly elevated in recipients of
Suz12Plt8/þ
c-Mplþ/þ
marrow relative to controls, which reca-
pitulated results seen in unmanipulated Suz12Plt8/þ
c-Mplþ/þ
mice (Table S2) and demonstrated that the phenotype was
intrinsic to the bone marrow. Platelet count was similar in
recipients of Suz12Plt8/þ
c-Mpl–/–
and Suz12þ/þ
c-Mpl–/–
marrow,
which is likely due to the low representation of c-Mpl–/–

these animals (Table S2).

hematopoietic tissues than the wild-type competitor cells,
irrespective of the c-Mpl genotype (Figure 6A). This difference
was most apparent on the c-Mpl–/–
background, where the
increase was statistically signiﬁcant in the peripheral blood,
spleen, and bone marrow. The low contribution of c-Mpl–/–
bone marrow to hematopoiesis, even in the presence of a c-
Mpl–/–
competitor, is most likely due to compromised
competition with residual host-derived wild-type marrow.
This effect is compounded in recipients of secondary trans-
plants, with Suz12Plt8/þ
c-Mpl–/–
cells contributing 18% of the
bone marrow, whereas Suz12þ/þ
c-Mpl–/–
cells represented just
3%. Although their contribution to hematopoiesis was
elevated, Suz12Plt8/þ
HSCs were not rapidly exhausted and
continued to contribute effectively to hematopoiesis in
tertiary recipients (Figure 6B). Previous reports have high-
lighted a critical role for Ezh2 and the PRC2 complex during
B cell maturation [27]; however, the representation of
Suz12Plt8/þ
cells was consistent across various cell lineages,
which included B cells, T cells, granulocytes, and macro-
phages. This suggested that the Plt8 mutation does not impair
differentiation (unpublished data).
Suz12 Knockdown in Primary Bone Marrow Exacerbates
the Plt8 Phenotype
The phenotype of Suz12Plt8/þ
mice reﬂects the effect of
partial (heterozygous) loss of Suz12 function. To gain further
insight into the role of Suz12 in hematopoiesis, we used short
hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated silencing to more pro-
foundly impair Suz12 expression.
Retroviral shRNA constructs were designed to target two

Suz12 in Hematopoiesis
core components of PRC2 (Suz12 and Ezh2) or a nonspeciﬁc
sequence (Nons), and they were validated in the GATA1–
megakaryocyte-erythroid (G1ME) cell line [51]. A 70%
reduction in Suz12 mRNA was observed in cells that
expressed shRNA-Suz12, and a similar reduction in expres-
sion was obtained with the construct that targeted Ezh2
(Figure S2A). Analysis of protein expression revealed a
dramatic reduction in Suz12 protein levels in cells that
expressed shRNA-Suz12 (Figure S2B). Ezh2 expression and
H3K27-3Me levels were also reduced in these cells, which
conﬁrmed that PRC2 function was greatly impaired. H3K27-
3Me levels were similarly reduced in cells that expressed
shRNA-Ezh2 but not in cells that express shRNA-Nons.
We next determined the effect of shRNA-mediated
depletion of Suz12 in HSCs. To perform this experiment,
CD45Ly5.1
recipient mice were transplanted with CD45Ly5.2
bone marrow that had been infected with either the MSCV
LTR-miR30-SV40 GFP (LMS)-Nons or the LMS-Suz12 retro-
virus. The proportion of virally transduced cells (Ly5.2þ
GFPþ
) was determined prior to transplant and then moni-
tored in primary and secondary recipients.
Thymocytes and splenocytes isolated from primary recip-
ients were used to verify the reduction in Suz12 expression in
vivo. Within the thymus, Suz12 protein expression was
speciﬁcally reduced in cells infected with the LMS-Suz12
virus (Ly5.2þ
GFPþ
) (Figure 7A). Ezh2 protein levels were also
reduced in these cells (Figure 7A), which is consistent with
results obtained in G1ME cells. The expression of Suz12 and
Ezh2 was not altered in Ly5.2þ
GFPþ
cells isolated from
recipients of marrow infected with the LMS-Nons construct.
Similar results were obtained when the level of Suz12 mRNA
was quantiﬁed in these cells (Figure S3).
The contribution of cells infected with LMS-Suz12 to
recipient hematopoiesis increased steadily over the course of
the experiment; they represented 15.2% of the donor
population at the time of transplantation, which increased
to 39.8% in primary recipients and to 49.7% in secondary
recipients (Figure 7B). This increase was speciﬁcally associ-
ated with Suz12 deﬁciency, as cells transduced with the LMS-
Nons vector were present at a gradually reducing frequency
at infection, in primary recipients, and in secondary
recipients (23.7%, 18.1%, and 9.8%, respectively), which is
consistent with results using unmanipulated wild-type bone
marrow (Figure 7B). In an attempt to standardise the three
experiments and account for differences in the absolute
number of GFPþ
cells in each donor, a ratio was calculated

using paired donor and recipient data. These data demon-
strate that the representation of cells infected with the LMS-
Suz12 construct increased by approximately 2-fold upon
transplantation into primary recipients, and a similar
increase was observed upon transplantation into secondary
recipients (Figure 7C), whereas the representation of LMS-
Nons–infected cells remained relatively constant. Changes
within the progenitor compartment were also greater than
those observed in Suz12Plt8/þ
mice; as both blast colony
formation and megakaryocyte progenitor number was ele-
vated in recipients of marrow infected with the LMS-Suz12
construct (Table 3).
Identification of Genes Sensitive to PRC2 Dysfunction in
HSCs
We next analysed gene expression changes in hemato-
poietic progenitors isolated from Suz12Plt8/þ
mice and
recipients of LMS-Suz12–infected bone marrow. Global gene
expression was examined in LSK cells from the bone marrow
of Suz12Plt8/þ
c-Mplþ/þ
and Suz12þ/þ
c-Mplþ/þ
mice. Expression
differences between the two genotypes were modest, which
was consistent with studies performed with Suz12-deﬁcient
embryonic stem (ES) cells [9,52]. We selected 100 genes with
the most signiﬁcant differences for further analysis (LSK top
100, Table S3). In addition, we isolated Ly5.1–
Lin–
c-Kitþ
(LK)
cells from mice reconstituted with LMS-Suz12– or LMS-
Nons–infected bone marrow. Sca-1 expression was negligible
in the Lin–
fraction of the bone marrow of secondary
transplant recipients, despite the long-term repopulating
capacity of these cells; therefore, the progenitor-enriched LK
cell population was used for gene expression analysis. We
selected the 100 genes that changed most signiﬁcantly, and
were not viral-encoded, for further analysis (LK top 100,
Table S4 and Text S1).
We analysed the overlap between the LSK and LK top 100
datasets, and we found eight genes that were over-expressed
in both Suz12Plt8/þ
LSK cells and LK cells deﬁcient in Suz12
compared with controls (Figure 8A), far more than expected
by chance (p , 0.00001). Real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR)
was used to conﬁrm results obtained in the microarray and to
better quantify the magnitude of the changes in gene
expression. Similar to results obtained with thymocytes and
splenocytes, Suz12 expression was markedly reduced in LK
cells that express shRNA-Suz12, whereas the expression of
Bex2 and Bex4 was elevated. It remains to be determined
whether the genes deregulated in Suz12Plt8/þ
HSCs are direct
targets of PRC2.
Discussion
Using a forward genetics approach, we identiﬁed a loss-of-
function allele of Suz12 that suppresses the thrombocytope-
nia evident in c-Mpl–/–
mice. As well as having an increased
platelet count, Suz12Plt8/þ
c-Mpl–/–
mice display alterations in
the number and function of multipotent hematopoietic
progenitors and stem cells. Aspects of the Suz12Plt8/þ
phenotype were only apparent in the absence of thrombo-
poietin signalling, which conﬁrmed that c-Mpl–/–
mice provide
a sensitised background to detect changes in the progenitor
compartment and in the platelet lineage [48]; however, the
repopulating activity of HSCs was elevated, irrespective of the
c-Mpl genotype. The stem cell phenotype was exacerbated

collected and stained with antibodies to CD45Ly5.1

Suz12 in Hematopoiesis
when Suz12 was inhibited by shRNA-mediated silencing,
providing independent conﬁrmation that the mutant pheno-
type is a direct result of impaired Suz12 expression. The
identiﬁcation of the Plt8 mutation has shown that Suz12 is
sensitive to gene dosage within the HSC compartment, an
observation that was not appreciated in an earlier loss-of-
function study [23], and this lead us to investigate the
function of Suz12 and PRC2 during hematopoiesis.
Whether the reduction in Suz12 protein evident in
Suz12Plt8/þ
mice would affect the stability of the PRC2
complex was unclear. Previous studies have demonstrated
that Ezh2, Suz12, and Eed are interdependent, such that a
reduction in any one of the PRC2 components negatively
affects the stability of the others. This is evident in mice
harbouring loss-of-function alleles of PRC2 components
[23,53] and in cell lines in which one of the components has
been impaired by RNA-mediated silencing [11]. Mice that are
heterozygous for the Plt8 mutation also display decreased
levels of Ezh2, suggesting that the reduced expression of
Suz12 limits the formation of the PRC2 complex. Similarly,
gene dosage effects are evident in mice that carry hypomor-
phic alleles of Eed (Eed3354
or Eed1989
) [21,33,54,55] or a loss-of-
function allele of Ezh2 (this study). The discovery that Ezh2,
Eed, and Suz12 are all haploinsufﬁcient demonstrates that the
activity of the PRC2 complex is exquisitely sensitive to
alterations in the expression of its components. This is
further supported by the observation that the composition
and activity of the complex becomes altered when the
components are expressed at inappropriate levels [56].
One of our key ﬁndings was that Suz12Plt8/þ
mice have
enhanced HSC activity, which likely accounts for changes that
are evident in the peripheral blood. A similar phenotype has
been described in mice that carry a hypomorphic allele of
Eed. Eed3354/þ
mice show elevated numbers of multi-potent
progenitors in long-term bone marrow cultures [33], and this
ﬁnding was used to suggest an important function for PRC2
in restricting the proliferation of myeloid and lymphoid
progenitors. Our study extends this result and has identiﬁed a
role for PRC2 in regulating the functional activity of HSCs.
The proliferative defects evident in Eed3354/þ
mice worsen
with age and ultimately progress to leukaemia [33]. Although
HSCs derived from Suz12Plt8/þ
mice were clearly more
competitive than wild-type cells, leukaemia was not observed
in Suz12Plt8/þ
mice or in recipients of Suz12Plt8/þ
bone marrow.
It is tempting to speculate that the phenotypic similarities
between Eed3354/þ
and Suz12Plt8/þ
mice result from their
common contribution to the PRC2 complex, and that
progression to leukaemia in Eed3354/þ
mice is a consequence
of a greater impairment to PRC2 activity. Elevated platelet
counts evident in Ezh2þ/-
c-Mpl–/–
animals strongly suggest that
PRC2 is central to the phenotypic changes in Suz12Plt8/þ
mice;
however, it remains possible that Suz12 has a functional role
that is independent of the complex.
A series of elegant studies have demonstrated that PRC2
Figure 7. Inhibition of Suz12 by shRNA-Mediated Silencing Elevates HSC
Contribution to Hematopoiesis
Bone marrow extracted from 5-FU–treated mice was infected with either
the LMS-Nons or the LMS-Suz12 virus and transplanted into recipient
mice. Three independent infections were performed, and in each case,
infected cells were transplanted into five recipient animals. A selection of
primary recipients (9–11) were used as donors for secondary transplants,
in each case these cells were transplanted into 3–5 recipient mice.
(A) Thymocytes were isolated from primary recipients 12 wk after
transplantation and fractionated based upon expression of GFP (þ or –);
low or intermediate populations were detected in some mice (low).
Protein lysates were prepared from sorted cells and Western blotting was
performed to detect expression of Suz12, Ezh2, or histone H3.
Nonspecific bands have been marked (*) and an arrow is used to denote
residual Suz12 signal that persisted after the membrane was stripped
and reprobed.
(B) The frequency of cells that carried the virus (GFPþ
) was monitored
prior to transplantation (Input) and at 8–12 wk after transplantation in
primary or secondary recipients.
(C) The representation of GFPþ
cells was compared between donor and
recipient populations and a ratio calculated (recipient GFP%/donor
GFP%). Equal representation in recipient and donor populations would
result in a ratio of 1.0. The representation of cells infected with LMS-
Suz12 continued to increase over the course of the experiment, whereas
the representation of LMS-Nons cells remained constant. Data show the
mean and standard error. Statistical significance was assessed using an
unpaired t-test.

Suz12 in Hematopoiesis
functions to maintain the undifferentiated state in embryonic
stem cells, and it is quite possible that the complex fulﬁls a
similar role in HSCs. An increased rate of differentiation, in
the context of PRC2 deﬁciency, could explain the elevated
contribution of Suz12Plt8/þ
HSCs to hematopoiesis and is
consistent with the progressive nature of the hematopoietic
defects evident in Eed3354/þ
mice [33]. Kamminga and
colleagues recently demonstrated that exogenous expression
of Ezh2 preserves stem cell function during serial bone
marrow transplantation and suggested that PRC2 prevents
replicative senescence within the HSC compartment [36].
With this in mind, we performed experiments to assess the
integrity of homeostatic mechanisms that regulate the HSC
pool in Suz12Plt8/þ
mice. Although alterations in the number
and function of HSCs were detected, several observations
suggest that these cells retain their ability to self-renew and
do not become senescent prematurely: ﬁrst, the hemato-
poietic system is stable in Suz12Plt8/þ
mice as they age; second,
Suz12Plt8/þ
HSCs continue to contribute effectively to hema-
topoiesis, even after three rounds of transplantation; and
third, mice that carry the Plt8 mutation respond normally to
treatment with the cytotoxic agent 5-ﬂuorouracil, which
selectively targets cycling cells (unpublished data). It is likely
that additional resources, such as conditional targeted alleles,
will be required to determine the precise role of PRC2 within
the HSC compartment.
To better understand the mechanism by which the Plt8
mutation inﬂuences hematopoiesis, we investigated changes
in gene expression associated with PRC2 deﬁciency. Before
this study, knowledge of PRC2 target genes within the
hematopoietic compartment was limited. We used shRNA-
mediated silencing to impair Suz12 expression in the erythro-
megakaryocytic cell line G1ME and in primary hematopoietic
progenitors and stem cells. Global analysis of gene expression
by microarray identiﬁed several hundred transcripts that
were differentially expressed in cells that lacked Suz12. The
vast majority of these genes showed elevated expression,
which supports the prevailing view that PRC2 and H3K27-
3Me are required for the maintenance of transcriptional
repression (reviewed in [6]). Previous studies have identiﬁed
genes that are regulated by PRC2 in a variety of different cell
types, including mouse and human ES cells, ﬁbroblasts, and
numerous cell lines derived from tumours. Our results
suggest that PRC2 regulates a distinct set of genes in
hematopoietic cells, because very few of the genes identiﬁed
as mis-regulated in Suz12-deﬁcient hematopoietic cells have
previously been reported as PRC2 targets [9–11,52].
We identiﬁed eight genes that were similarly altered in
Suz12Plt8/þ
LSK cells and Suz12-deﬁcient progenitors (LK
cells), demonstrating that some target genes are conserved
between stem cells and progenitors. This included the
uncharacterised transcript 2810025M15Rik, which was also
up-regulated in Suz12-deﬁcient G1ME cells (unpublished
data). Other genes were speciﬁcally altered within primary
progenitor cells, which included a series of genes that are
inappropriately expressed in cancer cells. Bex2, Bex4, and
Fibulin have been implicated in the progression of various
types of cancer—including breast cancer, glioma, and
prostate cancer [57–60]—and work with cell lines and
primary tumour samples has provided evidence that epige-
netic mechanisms contribute to the regulation of these genes.
For example, both Bex2 and Bex4 become activated when
cancer cells are treated with agents that inhibit DNA
methylation [58]. Our results suggest that Polycomb group
proteins contribute to silencing these genes. A recent study
identiﬁed a subset of breast cancers that express high levels of
Bex2, and it will be important to determine whether these
tumours display impaired PRC2 function [61]. Tumours that
express Bex2 are highly sensitive to treatment with tamoxifen,
and the inhibition of PRC2 may represent a mechanism to
promote Bex2 expression. Few studies have addressed the role
of these genes in leukaemogenesis, yet it has been shown that
Bex2 is highly expressed in acute myeloid leukaemia samples
that carry activating translocations in the trithorax group
gene, Mixed lineage leukaemia (Mll) [62,63]. Bex2 expression
appears to be highly responsive to changes that disrupt the
balance between Polycomb and trithorax complexes. PRC2
has also been implicated in the development of acute
promyelocytic leukaemia via direct interaction with the
oncogenic fusion protein PML-RAR [64]. Our results suggest
that PRC2 may contribute to leukaemogenesis by directly
silencing tumour suppressor genes.
Modulation of PRC2 complex, either through inhibition or
enhancement of complex activity, has distinct consequences
for the behaviour of HSCs. Major impairment of the complex
is associated with defective maturation in lymphoid cells and
leukaemia, whereas the modest reduction in complex activity
in Suz12Plt8/þ
mice enhances blood cell production and the
performance of HSCs during transplantation. Our data
support an important role for PRC2 in regulating gene

during development and in disease.
Materials and Methods
ENU mutagenesis screen and genetic mapping. c-Mpl–/–
mice used
in this study were maintained on an inbred C57BL/6 background [41].
Male c-Mpl–/–
mice were injected with 200–400 mg/kg N-ethyl-N-
nitrosourea (Sigma), which was dissolved in ethanol and diluted in
sodium citrate buffer (100 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 50 mM
sodium citrate). ENU-treated mice were mated to c-Mpl–/–
females to
produce ﬁrst-generation (G1) mice for analysis. At 7 wk of age,
G1 mice were bled, and platelet counts were measured using an Advia
120 automated haematological analyser (Bayer). G1 mice with
elevated platelet counts (.300 3 106/ml) were bred with c-Mpl–/–
mice
to test for heritability. Using this approach, the PLT8 pedigree was
established, in which approximately 50% of mice showed elevated
platelet count consistent with a dominant mode of inheritance.
Progeny-tested mice, with inferred genotype C57BL/6 Mpl–/–
Plt8/þ,
were crossed with 129/Sv Mpl–/–
þ/þmice to produce an F1 population.
F1 mice with high platelet counts (.150 3 106
/ml) were intercrossed
to generate F2 mice for mapping. DNA was isolated from 90 F2 mice
and a genome-wide scan was performed with polymorphic micro-
satellite markers. A candidate interval for Plt8 was identiﬁed between
D11MIT245 and D11MIT120 on Chromosome 11 (from base pair
77,045,359 to 83,660,314). Additional SSLP markers were designed
using PRIMER3 software available through the Whitehead Institute
for Biomedical Research (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/). A further 531 F2
mice were genotyped, and the candidate interval was reﬁned to 1.4
Mbp between CAR28 and CAR48 (from base pair 79,314,902 to
80,704,402). Mapping and sequencing primers are included as
supplementary information.
Genomic PCR and DNA sequencing. Genomic DNA was isolated
from affected PLT8 mice and exons were ampliﬁed by PCR. PCR was
carried out with Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) in buffer
supplied by the manufacturer. Reactions contained approximately 20
ng of template DNA, 2.5 mM MgSO4, 50 lM dNTPs, 2 units of
polymerase, and 10 pmol of each primer. PCR products were treated
with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation) according to the manufacturers
instruction, and sequenced using the Big Dye Terminator V3.1
sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reactions were
centrifuged through G-50 sephadex columns (GE Healthcare) to
remove additional dye products, before processing on an ABI 3700
sequence analyser (Applied Biosystems).
Haematological analysis. Manual or automated counts were
performed on blood collected from the retro-orbital plexus into
sample tubes coated with EDTA (Sarstedt, Germany). In vitro colony
assays were used to characterise hematopoietic progenitors as
described [41]. Bone marrow (2.5 3 104
cells) or spleen cells (5 3
104
cells) were cultured in 1 ml of 0.3% agar in DMEM supplemented
with 20% (v/v) FCS and various recombinant cytokines as deﬁned in
the text.
CFU-S were enumerated 12 d after transplantation of donor bone
marrow (1.5 3 105
c-Mpl–/–
cells or 7.5 3 104
c-Mplþ/þ
cells) into lethally
irradiated recipients. Spleens were ﬁxed in Carnoy’s solution (60% (v/
v) ethanol, 30% (v/v) chloroform and 10% (v/v) glacial acetic acid).
Competitive transplantation studies were performed using
CD45Ly5.2
donor animals and CD45Ly5.1
recipients. In each experiment,
1 3 106
test cells (CD45Ly5.2
) were transplanted into lethally irradiated
CD45Ly5.1
recipients (5 per donor marrow), with an equal number of
CD45Ly5.1
competitor cells. Competitor cells were matched by c-Mpl
genotype, because c-Mpl–/–
HSCs are rapidly out-competed by c-Mplþ/þ
cells [45]. Peripheral blood was analysed at 28 d and at 56 d post
transplant, and after 3 mo, bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and
peripheral blood were analysed and serial transplantations were
performed. In each case, the representation of test and competitor
(CD45Ly5.2
and CD45Ly5.1
) was measured in B cells (B220þ
), T cells (CD4þ
,
CD8þ
), and in macrophages and neutrophils (Gr1þ
/Mac1þ
). Bone
marrow from primary recipients was pooled within each donor group
for use in secondary transplants, and the representation of CD45Ly5.2
cells was measured before transplantation. For secondary transplants,
2 3 106
test cells were injected into each CD45Ly5.1
recipient, and
tertiary transplants were performed in the same manner.
Analysis of DNA content and nuclear ploidy. Bone marrow was
isolated into CATCH buffer (Phenol-red free, Ca2þ
-free Hank’s
balanced salt solution with 3% (w/v) BSA, 1.3 mM sodium citrate, 1
mM adenosine, 2 mM theophylline and 3% (v/v) FCS), and stained
with FITC-conjugated anti-CD41 antibody (BD Biosciences). Samples
were then treated with concentrated propidium iodide (0.05 mg/ml in
3.4 mM sodium citrate) for 1 h. Cells were washed in CATCH buffer,
and aggregates were removed by passage through a 100-lm sieve.
Samples were then treated with 50 lg/ml RNAse H (Promega) at room
temperature, before analysis on a FACScan 2 ﬂow cytometer (BD
Biosciences).
Western blotting and antibodies. Protein lysates were prepared
from primary tissues, or cell lines, in RIPA buffer (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-
40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 50
mM Tris.HCl pH 7.5) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche
Diagnostics). 293T cells grown in DMEM with 10% (v/v) FCS were
transfected with expression constructs using FuGENE-6 reagent
(Roche Diagnostics). Cells were lysed after 48 h and proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE. Protein was transferred to a PVDF
membrane and blotted with antibodies to detect Suz12, Ezh2,
Histone 3, H3K27-3Me (Upstate), Akt (Cell Signaling) or the FLAG-
epitope (M2) (Sigma).
Retrovirus production and shRNA-mediated knock-down. Retro-
viral supernatants were prepared by transient transfection of 293T
Figure 8. An Analysis of Gene Expression Changes in PRC2 Deficient
Hematopoietic Progenitors Cells
(A) A direct comparison identified eight genes that were significantly up-
regulated in both Suz12Plt8/þ
LSK cells (LSK top 100) and in LK cells that
expressed the Suz12 shRNA (LK top 100). This included Brain expressed 2
(Bex2), Bex4, Fibulin 1 (Fbln1), Heat shock protein 8 (Hspb8), Neural cell
adhesion molecule 1 (Ncam1), Olfactomedin 1 (Olfm1), and Protein
phosphatase 1E (Ppm1e).
(B) Expression changes were confirmed in sorted LK samples using Q-
PCR. Samples were sorted based upon expression of GFP (þ/–), and
expression values were compared to LK cells isolated from wildtype
C57BL/6 mice (C57).

Suz12 in Hematopoiesis
cells with plasmids that encode viral envelope proteins and a speciﬁc
LMS/LMP knock-down vector. shRNAmir constructs (pSM2) that
target Suz12 (A: V2MM_96046 or B: V2MM_196969), Ezh2 (A:
V2MM_35988 or B: V2MM_25325), and a nonspeciﬁc sequence
(Nons) were obtained from Open Biosystems, and the hairpin
sequence was subcloned into the LMS/LMP vectors [65,66]. The
LMS/LMP vectors drive expression of a modiﬁed micro RNA (mir30
backbone) with selectable markers EGFP or EGFP/puromycin,
respectively.
293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precip-
itation method. 293T cells were treated with 25 lM chloroquine for
30 min prior to transfection in DMEM with 10% (v/v) FCS. The
precipitated DNA was added dropwise to the cells, and the media was
changed after an 8-h incubation. Media was replaced with Iscove’s
modiﬁed Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) with 10% (v/v) FCS after 24 h,
and viral supernatants were harvested the following day.
Bone marrow infections. C57BL/6 (CD45Ly5.2
) mice were treated
with a single dose of 150 mg/kg 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) (ONCO-TAIN,
Mayne Pharmaceuticals) by intra peritoneal injection. After 5 d, bone
marrow was collected from femurs and tibias into PBS with 10% (v/v)
FCS. Red blood cells and dead cells were removed by centrifugation
through Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare). Cells were washed once with
PBS, and resuspended in IMDM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS
and cytokines (10 ng/ml IL-6, 5 ng/ml IL-3, 50 ng/ml Flt3 ligand, and
50 ng/ml SCF). Cells were grown overnight at 37 8C in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere with 10% CO2 in air. Retroviral supernatants were
applied to culture dishes pre-treated with RetroNectin (Takara
Biosciences), and centrifuged at 4000g for 1 h at 4 8C. Bone marrow
cells were co-cultured with the virus in the presence of polybrene (4
lg/ml) for 24 h to allow for infection. Cells were washed out of
polybrene-containing medium into fresh medium, and incubated for
24 h. Cells were removed from dish and washed twice in BSS 3% FCS
before being counted. These cells were used to reconstitute lethally
irradiated CD45Ly5.1
recipients; approximately 5–10 3 105
viable cells
were injected into each recipient.
RNA extraction and Q-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from tissues
or cell lines using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and reverse transcribed
with an oligo-dT primer using Superscript-III Reverse Transcriptase
according to the manufacturers instructions (Invitrogen). For sorted
cell populations, RNA was prepared using RNeasy mini puriﬁcation
columns (Qiagen). Q-PCR reactions were set up to quantify
expression of mouse Suz12, Ezh2, Eed, Hprt1, Bex2, Bex4, and Hmbs
using speciﬁc pre-designed Taqman gene expression assays
(Mm01304152_m1, Mm00468449_m1, Mm00469651_m1,
Mm00446968_m1, Mm02528127_s1, Mm02376173_g1, and
Mm00660262_g1, respectively) (Applied Biosystems). Typically,
PCR reactions were performed in 10 ll volume, and included the
following: 1 ll of cDNA, 0.5 ll pre-designed assay mix (primers and
sequence speciﬁc probe), 3.5 ll H2O, and 5 ll of 2x Taqman Universal
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). All Q-PCR reactions were
performed on the ABI 7900 HT real-time PCR platform (Applied
Biosystems). Ct values were derived using SDS2.2 software (Applied
Biosystems), and relative gene expression was calculated using the
2ÀDDCt
method [67].
Antibodies for ﬂow cytometry. Fluorophore- or biotin- conjugated
antibodies directed against mouse CD4 (clone GK1.5), CD43 (clone
57), CD8 (clone 53–6.7), c-Kit (clone 2B8), Flt3 (CD135) (clone
A2F10.1), IgD (clone 11–26c.2a), IgM (clone II/41), CD45Ly5.1
(clone
A20), CD45.2Ly5.2
(clone 104), Sca-1 (clone D7), Ter119 (clone TER-
119), Thy1.2 (CD90.2) (clone 53–2.1), and Rat Ig (clone MRK-1) were
obtained from Pharmingen. Anti-CD34 (clone RAM34) was obtained
from eBioscience, and goat anti-rat IgG was obtained from Southern
Biotech. Rat monoclonal antibodies against the mouse antigens CD3
(clone KT3–1.1), CD19 (clone ID3), B220 (clone RA3-6B2), CD11b
(clone M1/70), Gr1 (clone IA8), CD2 (clone RM2.1), CD8 (clone 53–
6.7), Ter119 (clone TER-119) were prepared in our own laboratory.
Puriﬁcation of LSK or LK cells. Bone marrow was harvested from
7–12-wk-old C57BL/6 mice, or secondary transplant recipients of
LMS-infected bone marrow, 4–6 mo post-transplant. Live nucleated
cells were puriﬁed by centrifugation in Nycodenz medium (Axis-
Shield) with a density of 1.086 g/cm3
. These cells were incubated with
a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies against the lineage markers CD3,
CD19, B220, CD11b, Gr1, CD2, CD8, and Ter119 prepared in our own
laboratories, then mixed with BioMag goat anti-rat IgG beads
(Qiagen). Linþ
cells were depleted using a Dynal MPC-L magnetic
particle concentrator (Invitrogen). Remaining cells were stained with
ﬂuorophore-conjugated anti-Rat Ig antibodies to allow residual Linþ
cells to be gated out, then with monoclonal antibodies to Sca-1, c-Kit,
CD34, Flt3, and CD45Ly5.1
(where applicable). Cells were ﬂow sorted
on a FACSDiva, FACSAria (BD Biosciences), or MoFlo (Dako).
LSK and LK global gene expression analysis. RNA extracted from
50,000–500,000 LSK or LK cells (Lin–
, Ly5.1–
, c-Kitþ
) was labeled,
ampliﬁed, and hybridised to Illumina MouseWG-6 V1.1 Expression
BeadChips according to Illumina standard protocols. Samples were
processed at the Queensland Institute of Molecular Biology, Brisbane,
Australia, and the Australian Genome Research Facility, Melbourne,
Australia. Each sample was derived from bone marrow LSK or LK
cells from at least six donor mice. A total of 12 LSK arrays were
performed (9 Suz12þ/þ
and 3 Suz12Plt8/þ
). Data were analyzed in R and
subjected to variance stabilising transformation and quantile normal-
ization. Linear modelling using an empirical Bayes approach,
including a batch factor, was applied to the data [68]. Data was
corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini and Hochberg
correction.
For the combinatorial comparison with LSK and LK datasets, all
probesets were considered (irrespective of expression level). Data
were normalized and corrected for multiple testing as above. A more
detailed description of microarray data treatment is provided (Text
S1). Microarray data is available in MIAME-compliant form at Array
Express (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) under accession (E-TABM-380).

Figure S1. Detection of Suz12 Deletion Mutants
A schematic representation of Suz12 truncation mutants is shown (at
left). Expression constructs were generated to direct synthesis of
Suz12 protein that lacked the N terminus (DN), or that lacked both
the N and C terminus (DNDC). Additional transfection controls
included a construct that directed expression of enhanced green
ﬂuorescent protein (EGFP) and a construct encoding Flag-tagged
Ezh2. Western blotting demonstrated that the Suz12 polyclonal
antibody bound to endogenous full-length Suz12 (marked by
asterisks), as well as to the truncated proteins (open circles).
Membranes were probed with the Flag antibody to identify epitope
tagged exogenous proteins (bottom panel).

Figure S2. Validation of Suz12 and Ezh2 shRNAs in G1ME Cells
RNA and protein levels of PRC2 components were measured in
G1ME cells infected with vector alone (LMP) or with viruses that
contained an shRNA targeted at a non speciﬁc sequence (Nons),
Suz12, or Ezh2.
(A) Gene expression was quantiﬁed using Taqman gene expression
assays and is shown relative to a reference sample prepared from
pooled G1ME cells (Cal). Hprt1 was used to normalise samples for
variation in cDNA concentration. Values represent the mean derived
from three independent infections. To determine whether the
targeted mRNA was reduced, samples were compared to the Nons
control. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed followed by
a Bonferroni post-hoc test (*p , 0.01, **p , 0.001).
(B) Protein expression was analysed in stably infected G1ME cell lines.
Western blotting was performed to detect expression of Suz12, Ezh2,
or H3K27-3Me. H3 was used to verify equal loading.

Figure S3. Conﬁrmation of Reduced Suz12 Expression in Primary
Cells
Thymocytes and splenocytes were isolated from primary recipients 12
wk after transplantation and fractionated based upon expression of
GFP (þ or –). cDNA was prepared from sorted cells, and Q-PCR was
performed to detect expression of Suz12, Ezh2, and the house keeping
gene Hprt1. Suz12 expression was clearly reduced in cells that
expressed the Suz12-shRNA, but not in cells infected with the Nons
construct. Although the level of Ezh2 protein was lower in thymocytes
deﬁcient in Suz12, this was not reﬂected in lower levels of Ezh2
transcript.
