Background
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal disorder characterized
by chronic complement-mediated hemolysis. Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal an-
tibody against the terminal complement protein C5, potently reduces chronic intra-
vascular hemolysis. We tested the clinical efficacy and safety of a 24-week treatment with
eculizumab in 6 Korean patients with PNH.
Methods
We enrolled 6 patients with PNH who had clinically significant hemolysis. Eculizumab
was administered intravenously at 600 mg/week for the first 4 weeks followed by 900
mg at week 5 and 2nd weekly thereafter.
Results
Three men and 3 women with a median age of 39.5 years (24-61 years) were enrolled.
The median duration of PNH was 11 years (6-25 years). Hemolysis occurred in all patients
[median lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, 7.95 times the upper limit of the reference
range of LDH]. All patients treated with eculizumab had a rapid and sustained reduction
in the degree of hemolysis. RBC transfusion requirements for 3 months were decreased
from 0-12 units (median requirement, 1.5 units) to 0-6 units (median requirement, 0
units). Improvement in fatigue was noted in 4 patients. Further, 5 patients who had been
receiving corticosteroids either reduced the dose or discontinued therapy. No significant
adverse events related to eculizumab therapy were observed.
Conclusion
These results show that eculizumab reduces the degree of intravascular hemolysis, re-
duces or eliminates the requirement of RBC transfusion, and improves anemia and fatigue
in patients with PNH. Eculizumab is an effective and safe option for treating Korean pa-
tients with PNH.

INTRODUCTION
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an ac-
quired clonal disorder caused by a somatic mutation in the
phosphatidylinositol glycan-complementation class A (PIG-
A) gene in hematopoietic stem cells [1-3]. Patients with
PNH present with intravascular hemolytic anemia, bone
marrow failure, and thrombosis. Many of the clinical mani-
festations of PNH result from complement-mediated intra-
vascular hemolysis. The life-threatening condition of throm-
boembolism (TE) is the most common cause of death in
patients with PNH, at least in Western populations (TE ac-
counts for 40-67% of patient deaths in these populations)
[1-3]. On the other hand, the incidence of TE is much lower
in Asian countries [2, 3]. Previously, the management of
PNH had been palliative and non-targeted, and it focused
on treating the symptoms of anemia and episodic hemolysis

rather than the underlying chronic hemolysis associated with
disease progression. Presently, allogeneic bone marrow trans-
plantation (BMT) is the only curative therapy for PNH.
Available supportive care options include blood transfusions
and nonspecific drug treatments including, but not limited
to, steroids and anticoagulants [4, 5]. The results of a retro-
spective analysis of 286 PNH patients from a national registry
in South Korea indicated that the cumulative incidence of
TE was 15%; TE was a strong predictor of mortality [6].
Despite medical intervention with supportive care (78% of
the patients used corticosteroids), patients continued to show
disabling symptoms, progressive complications, and early
mortality [7].
Eculizumab (SolirisⓇ
; Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Che-
shire, CT, USA), a humanized monoclonal antibody against
the terminal complement protein C5, has a direct and potent
effect on chronic intravascular hemolysis [4, 5, 8]. In 2007,
the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use
of eculizumab against PNH on the basis of its efficacy in
2 phase 3 clinical trials [9-11]. Eculizumab is highly effective
in reducing intravascular hemolysis in PNH patients, and
treatment with eculizumab decreases or eliminates the need
for blood transfusions; improves the quality of life; and re-
duces pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disorders,
and the risk of thrombosis [9-11]. In this study, we tested
the clinical efficacy and safety of eculizumab for treating
Korean patients with PNH. We report the results of a
24-week treatment with eculizumab.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 6 Korean patients with PNH, who were selected
from 5 institutions and had clinically significant hemolysis,
received eculizumab therapy. This study was initiated in
December 2009 and is currently ongoing. Patients who were
≥18 years of age, had a PNH granulocyte proportion of
≥10%, and had lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels of at
least 1.5 times the upper limit of the reference range (ULN)
of LDH were eligible. Further, patients with a history of
thrombosis or associated symptoms were included in this
study. Patients receiving stable doses of anticoagulants, iron
supplements, and immunosuppressive drugs, including corti-
costeroids, were also included. Patients were excluded, if
the platelet count was ＜20×109
/L; absolute neutrophil count
(ANC), ＜0.5×109
/L; and corrected reticulocyte count, ＜1%.
Patients with complement deficiency, active bacterial in-
fection, prior meningococcal disease, or prior hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation were also excluded.
Eculizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of
600 mg/week (±2 days) for the first 4 weeks 900 mg at
week 5 and 2nd
weekly thereafter. Two weeks before the
therapy was initiated, all patients were vaccinated against
Neisseria meningitidis, because the inhibition of complement
C5 increases the risk of developing neisserial infections.
Throughout the study, the patients received RBC trans-
fusions, if the transfusions were medically indicated. In ac-
cordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, written informed
consent was obtained from all patients prior to their enrol-
ment in this study.
We obtained the following information of the patients:
baseline clinical characteristics; demographics, laboratory
values; LDH, RBC, Hb, reticulocyte, WBC, ANC, platelet,
creatinine level, PNH clone size, medical history, symptoms,
history of TE, and treatment history. We regularly checked
the Hb levels and degree of hemolysis by measuring the
LDH levels, and collected information regarding any adverse
events at each dosing visit. We evaluated the degree of fatigue
by using the validated Functional Assessment of Chronic
Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) instrument [12]
from baseline. Total scores on the FACIT-Fatigue instrument
range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating an improve-
ment in fatigue. An increase of ≥3 points is considered
clinically significant for this instrument [12].
RESULTS
1. Patient characteristics
Three men and 3 women with a median age of 39.5 years
(24-61 years) were enrolled in this study. The median dura-
tion of PNH was 11 years (6-25 years). All patients were
diagnosed with PNH on the basis of flow cytometric analysis
of WBCs (CD59). The PNH clones in all patients were large
(median granulocyte clone size, 94.75%; range, 77.3-99%).
Of the 6 patients, 2 were previously diagnosed with aplastic
anemia (PNH/aplastic anemia); the other 4 had classic PNH.
All the patients had anemia (median Hb, 8.15 g/dL; range,
6.8-12.5 g/dL). Median neutrophil and platelet counts were
1.38×109
/L [range, (0.9 to 4.68)×10
9
/L] and 1.01×10
11
/L
[range, (0.42 to 2.19)×1011
/L], respectively. Further, 4 patients
had thrombocytopenia [platelet count, (0.42 to 1.2)×1011
/L]
and 2 had neutropenia (WBC count, ＜4.0×109
/L). Before
treatment with eculizumab, 5 patients had received RBC
transfusions and 5 had been treated with corticosteroids;
none were treated with immunosuppressive agents. More-
over, 2 patients had a history of thrombosis, and 1 patient
had been receiving warfarin. Hemolysis was noted in all
patients, and it was evaluated by the levels of LDH (median
LDH level, 7.95 times the ULN of LDH; range, 3.5-12.4
times) (Table 1). Furthermore, all the patients had fatigue
and hemoglobinuria, before eculizumab therapy was initiated.
Severe fatigue was noted in 4 patients, and severe abdominal
pain in 3 patients (Table 2).
2. Efficacy of eculizumab
1) Reduction in the degree of hemolysis
Of the 6 patients, 5 completed the 24-week therapy with
eculizumab. The sixth patient completed only 12 weeks of
treatment, because he was enrolled later than the other
patients. All patients treated with eculizumab had a rapid
and sustained reduction in the degree of hemolysis. The
reduction was evaluated by the change in LDH levels, and
this reduction was observed in all patients (median reduction

at 24 weeks, 84.5%; range, 69-88%) (Table 3). In all the
patients, the decrease in the LDH levels began after they
received a single dose of eculizumab, and LDH levels re-
mained within or just above the reference range during
eculizumab therapy (Fig. 1). The median LDH level at 24
weeks was 1.25 times the ULN of LDH. The reduction in
the degree of hemolysis resulted in an improvement in ane-
mia, and the median Hb level at 24 weeks was 10.2 g/dL
(range, 6.9-12.4 g/dL). During the 3 months preceding enroll-
ment, the RBC transfusion requirement of the patients was
0-12 units (median requirement, 1.5 units), whereas during
the first 3 months of this study, the range was reduced
to 0-6 units (median requirement, 0 units). Only 1 patient
who had PNH/aplastic anemia remained transfusion-depend-
ent (Fig. 2). However, the units transfused were reduced
from 12 units/3 months before treatment to 6 units during

2) Improvement of clinical symptoms
Fatigue was assessed by using the FACIT-Fatigue instrument.
Improvement in fatigue was noted in 4 patients (67%). The
FACIT-Fatigue scores improved by a median of 8 points
during the first 24 weeks of eculizumab therapy, and only
1 patient had decreased scores after therapy (Table 2).
Further, after the therapy, significant improvement in ab-
dominal pain was noted in the 3 patients who had severe
abdominal pain before treatment (Table 2).
3) Reduction or discontinuation of concomitant medi-
cation
One patient who had been receiving warfarin for prevent-
ing further thrombotic events discontinued the anticoa-
gulation therapy after the initiation of eculizumab therapy.
Moreover, after starting eculizumab therapy, 5 patients who
were being treated with corticosteroids reduced the dose
of the corticosteroid (N=1, prednisolone dose was reduced
from 60 mg/day to 3-12 mg/day) or discontinued the cortico-
steroid therapy (N=4).
3. Adverse events during treatment with eculizumab
There were no significant adverse events related to eculizu-
mab therapy. Mild to moderate headache was noted in 2
patients, and mild abdominal pain in only 1 patient (Table
2). Only 1 patient had a moderate degree of nausea and
vomiting. There were no cases of severe systemic infections.
None of the patients developed new thrombotic events dur-
ing the course of the treatment.
DISCUSSION
PNH is a chronic, often fatal disease characterized by
symptoms of fatigue and intermittent episodes of dysphagia,
abdominal pain, and hemoglobinuria [1]. The median surviv-

al time after diagnosis is about 10 years. The life-threatening
condition of TE is the most fatal complication of PNH [1-3].
Presently, allogeneic BMT is the only curative therapy for
PNH, but this therapy is associated with significant morbidity
and mortality. The International Bone Marrow Transplant
Registry reported that the 2-year survival probability was
56% in 48 recipients of HLA-identical sibling BMT between
1978 and 1995 [13]. Therefore, supportive treatments, includ-
ing RBC transfusion and corticosteroid therapy, have been
generally used for reducing the symptoms in PNH patients.
However, these medical interventions cannot prevent the
progressive complications and early mortality associated with
this disease [1-3].
Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that pre-
vents the activation of complement C5 and the subsequent
formation of the cytolytic membrane attack complex of
complement. Since the introduction of eculizumab for the
treatment of PNH, few cases from Asian countries have
been reported. In this study, we evaluated the safety and
efficacy of eculizumab for treating Korean patients with
PNH. No serious infusion-related problems were noted dur-
ing the treatment period. We confirm that both the pre-
viously recommended dose and administration interval of
eculizumab are safe and well tolerated in Korean patients
with PNH.
We observed rapid and sustained reduction of LDH levels
to, or just above, the ULN of LDH during eculizumab therapy
in Korean patients with relatively large PNH clones (median
granulocyte clone size, 94.75%). The median LDH level de-
creased from 7.95 times the ULN of LDH at baseline to
1.25 times the ULN at 24 weeks. The reduction in the degree
of hemolysis after eculizumab therapy was associated with
a significant improvement in anemia, which was indicated
by a rise in the Hb level from a median level of 8.15 g/dL
at baseline to 10.2 g/dL at 24 weeks. We also observed stabili-
zation of the number of RBC units transfused. Among the
2 patients who were previously diagnosed with PNH/aplastic
anemia, 1 patient remained transfusion-dependent during
eculizumab therapy (1/6). However, the RBC units transfused
were reduced from 12 units/3 months before treatment to
6 units during the initial 3 months of treatment (50% reduc-
tion). In the open-label, 52-week, Phase 3 study (SHEPHERD)
[11], the reductions in transfusion were observed even in
patients with baseline platelet counts of ＜65×109
/L. These
data suggest that patients with both classic PNH and PNH
associated with other bone marrow failure syndromes will
benefit from eculizumab therapy. However, when appro-
priate, young PNH patients with life-threatening cytopenias
(e.g., severe aplastic anemia) should be recommended alloge-
neic BMT.
Fatigue is a common symptom in patients with PNH,
and it occurs not only because of anemia but is also closely
linked to hemolysis and nitric oxide depletion due to chronic
hemolysis [1, 2]. In previous trials, the FACIT-Fatigue scores
significantly improved within 1 week of treatment (median
increase, 3 points), and this effect sustained throughout a
period of 52 weeks (overall median increase, 10 points) [11].
A change of ≥3 points on the FACIT-Fatigue instrument
is considered clinically significant [12]. We observed a sig-
nificant improvement in the FACIT-Fatigue scores of 4 pa-
tients after eculizumab therapy (median increase at 24 weeks,
8 points), but the scores of 1 patient decreased, and this
change should be further evaluated with longer follow-up.
According to previous clinical trials, headache occurs in ap-
proximately 50% of the patients during eculizumab therapy
[11]. We noted 2 cases (33%) of mild to moderate headache
in this study. Although neisserial sepsis was the most serious
complication and other infections were a common side effect
of eculizumab therapy, previous clinical trial data suggest
that the infections were mild to moderate in nature and
not related to eculizumab therapy [9-11]. In this trial, we
could not find clinically significant infections during eculizu-
mab therapy. As there were no significant adverse events
and no newly developed TE events during the eculizumab
therapy, eculizumab treatment appeared to be safe in Korean
patients with PNH.
After eculizumab therapy, 5 patients who were being treat-
ed with corticosteroids reduced the dose of the corticosteroid
(N=1) or discontinued corticosteroid therapy (N=4); hence,
eculizumab therapy may reduce or eliminate the serious
side effects of corticosteroids in patients with PNH. Previous
clinical trials have shown that the TE event rate showed
a significant reduction in 24 weeks during eculizumab treat-
ment (92%) than in the same time period before treatment
[10, 11]. The discontinuation of the anticoagulation therapy
after the initiation of eculizumab therapy in patients with
a history of TEs is still controversial. Only 1 patient who
had been receiving warfarin before eculizumab therapy dis-
continued the medication during the therapy. Thus, eculizu-
mab may reduce or eliminate the several serious toxicities
associated with anticoagulation therapy in patients in whom
the therapy was discontinued.
In conclusion, this study is the first report on the efficacy
and safety of eculizumab for treating Korean patients with
PNH. This study showed that eculizumab reduced both the
degree of intravascular hemolysis and the need for RBC
transfusion. Further, improvements in anemia, fatigue, and
quality of life were noted after eculizumab treatment.
However, the long-term efficacy and safety of eculizumab
should be further evaluated in a larger study population.
