T cell expansion and memory formation are generally more effective when elicited by live
organisms than by inactivated vaccines. Elucidation of the underlying mechanisms is
important for vaccination and therapeutic strategies. We show that the massive expansion
of antigen-specific CD8 T cells that occurs in response to viral infection is critically
dependent on the direct action of type I interferons (IFN-Is) on CD8 T cells. By examining
the response to infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus using IFN-I receptor–
deficient (IFN-IR0) and –sufficient CD8 T cells adoptively transferred into normal IFN-IR
wild-type hosts, we show that the lack of direct CD8 T cell contact with IFN-I causes Ͼ99%
reduction in their capacity to expand and generate memory cells. The diminished expansion
of IFN-IR0 CD8 T cells was not caused by a defect in proliferation but by poor survival during
the antigen-driven proliferation phase. Thus, IFN-IR signaling in CD8 T cells is critical for
the generation of effector and memory cells in response to viral infection.
Antigen-specific CD8 T cells can undergo
massive clonal expansion during the acute
phase of viral infections. For example, in mice
infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus (LCMV), antigen-specific CD8 T cells
expand nearly 10,000-fold during week 1 of
infection (1). Robust levels of CD8 T cell ex-
pansion have been demonstrated in response to
several other acute viral and intracellular bacterial
infections in both mice and humans (2). The T
cell expansion that occurs during the acute
phase of infection serves to generate a large
number of effector cells that contribute to the
clearance of the pathogen and to memory cells
that confer increased levels of protection on re-
exposure. A majority of the effector T cells
generated during the acute phase die, but ‫ف‬5–
10% of these cells differentiate into long-lived
memory cells. Despite the death of the majority
of the effector cells, the size of the resulting
memory T cell pool is substantially higher than
the size of the naive precursor pool because of
the clonal expansion that takes place during the
antigen-driven proliferation phase.
Typical infections with live pathogens pro-
vide high initial levels of antigen and lead to acti-
vation of APCs via pattern recognition receptors,
resulting in the production of inflammatory cy-
tokines that in turn cause efficient activation of
APCs. Production of inflammatory cytokines is
complex and is dependent on the type of in-
fectious agent, the host, and their reciprocal
interaction (3, 4). Type I IFNs (IFN-Is), unlike
type II IFN (IFN-␥), are a multigene family of
antiviral cytokines produced in high amounts
early after viral infection (5). In mice, IFN-Is
constitute 13 IFN-I␣ subtypes, one IFN-␤, and
a recently discovered cytokine called limitin. All
the IFN-I species are known to act via at least
one known heterodimeric receptor complex that
is composed of two distinct chains, IFNAR1 and
IFNAR2, encoded by separate genes. Although
some evidence suggested that distinct IFN-I sub-
types might use different IFN-IAR subunits (5),
both IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains are required
to mediate the antiviral functions of IFN-I. All
infected cells are capable of making IFN-I, but
there are some specialized cell types called
plasmacytoid DCs that are equipped with the
capacity to produce massive amounts of IFN-I
under certain conditions.
In addition to directly interfering with viral
replication, IFN-I contributes to adaptive im-
mune responses. IFN-Is are known to induceThe online version of this article contains supplemental material.

activation of APCs, notably DCs (6–9). IFN-I also pro-
motes Th1 cytokine production, effector differentiation,
proliferation, and survival of activated T cells, at least in
vitro (10–15). Mice deficient in the functional IFN-I re-
ceptor (IFN-IR0 mice) were previously generated by ge-
netic disruption of IFNAR1 (16). The IFN-IR0 mice are
highly susceptible to viral infections because of the absence
of the direct viral control effects of IFN-I and show modest
levels of CD8 T cell responses to viral infections, and most
of the expanding CD8 T cells undergo functional exhaus-
tion or physical deletion (3, 16–17). Whether the effects of
IFN-I in vivo on antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses are
caused in part by a direct action on the T cells is difficult to
address because the IFN-IR0 mice also have aberrant innate
immune responses (3, 8), deregulated regulatory cell func-
tions, and control viral infections poorly (16–18). We have
addressed this limitation by examining the response of IFN-
IR0 and WT CD8 T cells to LCMV infection after adop-
tive transfer into WT hosts. We find that (a) the expansion
of the antigen-specific CD8 T cells in response to LCMV is
dependent on IFN-IR expression on these cells, (b) IFN-Is
mediate the sustained expansion of CD8 T cells by extend-
ing their survival during the antigen-driven proliferation
phase, and (c) the IFN-I–mediated survival of effector CD8
T cells during the antigen-driven proliferation phase is crit-
ically important for generation of optimal numbers of
memory cells.
RESULTS
Direct action of IFN-I on antigen-specific CD8 T cells is
critical for their expansion after viral infection
To directly address the role of IFN-IR in responding CD8 T
cells, we adoptively transferred WT versus IFN-IR0 TCR
transgenic CD8 T cells into WT mice and examined their re-
sponses to LCMV infection. IFN-IR0 LCMV GP33-41
epitope–specific P14 TCR transgenic CD8 T cells were gen-
erated by backcrossing 129/SvEv IFN-IR0 mice (16) to B6
mice 14 times, followed by intercrossing to P14 TCR trans-
genic mice (19), which were already backcrossed onto the B6
background (20). We first ensured that the IFN-IR0 P14
CD8 T cells were similar in their phenotype and function to
those of WT P14 CD8 T cells. Both were positive for MHC
tetramer Db complexed with GP33-41 peptide, and both
were CD44low and L-selectinhigh (Fig. 1 A). Likewise, their
functional properties were similar; neither population pro-
duced detectable levels of IFN-␥ after 5 h of stimulation in
vitro with GP33-41 peptide, and a fraction of both popula-
tions produced equivalently low levels of TNF-␣ after pep-
tide stimulation (Fig. 1 B). In addition, both WT and IFN-
IR0 P14 CD8 T cells were able to undergo several rounds of
proliferation after 3-d in vitro cultures in the presence of pep-
tide (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the IFN-IR0 P14 CD8 T cells were not
intrinsically defective in their in vitro response.
To measure response in vivo, purified WT (Ly5.2) and
IFN-IR0 (Ly5.2) P14 CD8 T cells from littermate mice

were transferred (20,000 cells/mouse) separately into naive
C57BL/6 Ly5.1 WT mice. Spleen cell analysis after infec-
tion showed that, as expected, the WT donor cells under-
went massive clonal expansion by day 5 and continued to
expand until day 8 (Fig. 2, A and B, top). In marked con-
trast to the ‫ف‬2,500-fold expansion exhibited by the WT
donor cells, the IFN-IR0 donor cells displayed remarkably
(Ͼ99%) diminished expansion (Fig. 2, A and B, bottom).
The endogenous polyclonal (Ly5.1ϩve) CD8 T cell re-
sponse to GP33-41 epitope (Fig. 2 A, left quadrants) and
the endogenous CD8 and CD4 T cell responses to other
known epitopes of LCMV (not depicted) were similar in
both the groups and led to clearance of the virus by day 7
after infection. However, there were marginal differences
in the viral titer on day 2 after infection (0.9 Ϯ 0.75 ϫ 107
and 2.8 Ϯ 1.3 ϫ 107 PFU/g of spleen in WT P14 CD8 T
cell recipients and IFN-I R0 P14 CD8 T cell recipients,
respectively).
Comparison of WT P14 and IFN-IR0 P14 CD8 T cell responses
in the same host
To address whether differences in antigenic load or other
environmental factors contributed to the observed effect on
expansion, WT and IFN-IR0 P14 CD8 T cells bearing dif-
ferent congenic markers (WT ϭ Thy1.2, Ly5.1 and IFN-
IR0 ϭ Thy1.2, Ly5.2) were cotransferred into the same host
(Thy1.1, C57BL/6) in equal numbers and analyzed after in-
fection (Fig. 3 A). We observed similar differences in expan-
sion in this setting. This finding indicated that differences in
the host environment were not responsible for the dimin-
ished expansion of IFN-IR0 cells.
Reduced expansion of IFN-IR0 P14 CD8 T cells was not
caused by preferential sequestration in other tissues
We next addressed whether the diminished expansion ob-
served in the spleen was caused by the preferential sequestra-
tion of IFN-IR0 P14 CD8 T cells in another compartment.

Fig. 3 B shows that the expansion of IFN-IR0 P14 donor
CD8 T cells was also diminished in several other lymphoid

preferential sequestration in other tissues.

capable of producing IFN-␥ and TNF-␣ at levels and fre-
quencies similar to WT donor cells on day 7 after infection
(Fig. 4 A). However, the frequency of cells expressing
granzyme B directly ex vivo was reduced in IFN-IR0 P14
effector CD8 T cells compared with the WT P14 effector
CD8 cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Neither WT nor IFN-IR0 ef-
fector CD8 T cells produced the Th2 cytokines IL-4 or IL-
10 upon peptide stimulation in vitro (unpublished data).
Thus, the direct action of IFN-I on virus-specific CD8 T
cells is not only important for their expansion but also has
some role in the expression of the cytotoxic effector func-
tion–associated molecule granzyme B.
Contraction, memory generation, and maintenance of
IFN-I–unresponsive effector cells
After peak expansion at day 8, the expanded WT effector
CD8 T cells, as expected, underwent marked contraction
(‫ف‬10-fold) and those that survived differentiated into long-
lasting memory cells (Fig. 5 A, open circles). In contrast, the
small number of IFN-IR0 effector P14 CD8 T cells that
were present by day 8 generated a memory pool that was
‫ف‬100-fold smaller in size compared with the memory pool
generated from WT effector P14 CD8 T cells. The memory
cells generated from WT and IFN-IR0 P14 CD8 T cells
were both stably maintained for an extended period, sug-
gesting that the action of IFN-I on antigen-specific CD8 T
cells is critical during the antigen-driven proliferation/clonal
expansion phase but is not necessarily required to maintain
resting memory cells. Both WT and IFN-IR0 memory P14
CD8 T cells were capable of producing IFN-␥ after in vitro
stimulation with cognate peptide, indicating that the cyto-
kine effector function of the IFN-IR0 memory cells was not
compromised (Fig. 5 B). Thus, IFN-I action on virus-spe-
cific CD8 T cells is critically required for their expansion
during the antigen-driven proliferation phase, and the IFN-
I–mediated expansion has an important role in the genera-
tion of optimal numbers of memory cells.
The diminished expansion of IFN-IR0 CD8 T cells was not
related to clonal specificity or differences in precursor
frequency, virus-mediated cell death, or rejection
It is surprising that the IFN-IR0 P14 CD8 T cells exhibited a
Ͼ99% reduction in their expansion in vivo (Figs. 2 and 3)
despite normal proliferative responses during short-term in
vitro cultures (Fig. 1). Additionally, the fact that IFN-IR0
mice, in which neither APCs nor T cells can respond to
IFN-I, elicit modest levels of virus-specific CD8 T cell ex-
pansion, at least in the initial phase of infection (3, 16–17),
prompted us to carefully evaluate several possibilities, includ-
ing precursor frequency, clonal specificity, rejection by the
host, and virus-mediated killing.
The diminished expansion of IFN-IR0 donor P14 CD8
T cells after infection did not reflect differences in initial
splenic engraftment because in other experiments, in which
higher numbers (107) of cells were transferred, the splenic
engraftment was very similar (‫%01ف‬ of the transferred cell

hosts. 0.8 ϫ 106 each of WT (Thy1.2, Ly5.1) and IFN-IR0 (Thy1.2, Ly5.2)
P14 CD8 T cells were transferred into (A) naive B6 Thy1.1 mice or into (B)
LCMV-immune Thy1.1 mice that had previously received equal numbers of
WT plus IFN-IR0 CD8 T cells before LCMV infection. WT/IFN-IR0 donor CD8
T cell ratios were analyzed at days 1 and 8 after transfer. The donor cells
were identified based on positive staining for Thy1.2 as well as CFSE (R1
gate). In B, freshly transferred Thy1.2 donor CD8 T cells were distinguished
(R1 gate) from previously primed Thy1.2 memory CD8 cells (R2 gate) based
on the CFSE label. The numbers in parenthesis indicate the average recovery
of donor cells per spleen (n ϭ 3) in each group. Numbers represent the

numbers between days 1 and 2 after transfer) for both WT
and IFN-IR0 P14 CD8 T cell donors. These donor IFN-IR0
naive P14 cells persisted in uninfected recipient mice for Ͼ1
month at levels similar to the WT cells (unpublished data).
Moreover, the memory cells generated from IFN-IR0 donor
CD8 T cells after the resolution of infection were main-
tained stably for extended periods (Fig. 5). Additionally, nei-
ther naive mice (Fig. 6 A) nor the immune mice that previ-
ously received a mixture of WT plus IFN-IR0 P14 cells and
LCMV infection (Fig. 6 B) rejected freshly transferred WT
or IFN-IR0 P14 CD8 T cells. Also, the preferential expan-
sion of WT P14 CD8 T cells as observed in Fig. 2 was simi-
larly seen in littermate IFN-IRϩ/ϩ and IFN-IRϩ/Ϫ hosts
(the latter [heterozygous] mice have a mutated IFN-IR allele
encoding a G418 resistance gene; Fig. 7 A, middle and top;
reference 16). Moreover, the WT P14 CD8 T cells under-
went preferential, albeit low, expansion in infected IFN-IR0
hosts (Fig. 7 A, bottom) in which virus was not cleared (Fig.
7 B, bottom), and production of IFN-I was not compro-
mised (reference 3; unpublished data). Collectively, these re-
sults demonstrate that the diminished expansion seen in the
IFN-IR0 donor cells was not related to rejection but was be-
cause of the inability to respond to IFN-I during the anti-
gen-driven proliferation phase.
The diminished expansion of IFN-IR0 donor P14 CD8 T
cells was unlikely to be caused by their preferential lysis by di-
rect virus infection by itself because LCMV Armstrong is nei-
ther known to infect CD8 T cells nor to cause the death of
infected cells in mice (21–24). Nevertheless, we tested this
possibility by transferring a mixture of bystander ovalbumin-
specific WT OT-1 and IFN-IR0 OT-1 TCR transgenic
CD8 T cells into WT mice, followed by analyzing their ratio
before and after LCMV infection. If LCMV preferentially
kills the IFN-IR0 CD8 T cells, the IFN-IR0 OT-1 CD8 T
cells should decline more than the WT OT-1 CD8 T cells af-
ter infection. The ratio of the IFN-IR0 versus WT OT-1
CD8 T cells (none LCMV specific) did not preferentially de-
crease after LCMV infection (Fig. 8 A, No infection vs.
LCMV only). We repeated these experiments by separately
transferring CFSE-labeled WT and IFN-IR0 OT-1 CD8 T
cells into WT hosts to assess whether the IFN-IR0 OT-1 cells
were undergoing proliferation in a bystander fashion. Neither
of them proliferated by day 5 after LCMV infection, suggest-
ing that the IFN-IR0 CD8 T cells were not undergoing any
preferential bystander proliferation after infection (unpub-
lished data). These experiments, though they do not test
whether LCMV infects CD8 T cells or not, confirm that the
IFN-IR0 bystander naive CD8 T cells were not undergoing
preferential decline more than the WT bystander CD8 T cells
under the conditions of LCMV infection (25). Cross-priming
by ovalbumin during LCMV infection (8), however, led to a
drastic decrease in the ratio of IFN-IR0 to WT OT-1 CD8 T
cells (Fig. 8 A, LCMV ϩ Ova). This was because of a prefer-
ential expansion of the WT OT-1 donor CD8 T cells over
the IFN-IR0 OT-1 donor cells. (Fig. 8 B). Thus, the striking
effect of IFN-I on clonal expansion during LCMV infection
applies not only to virus-specific CD8 T cells but also to CD8
T cells responding to a different antigen, ovalbumin.
Figure 7. The difference in the expansion of WT and IFN-IR0 CD8
T cells in response to viral infection was observed in IFN-IR0 and

cells (Ly5.2) were cotransferred into littermate IFN-Rϩ/ϩ, IFN-IRϩ/Ϫ, or

LCMV infection. (A) The ratio of WT/IFN-IR0 P14 donor CD8 T cells was

To assess the role of IFN-I on polyclonal naive CD8 T
cell precursors, we purified polyclonal IFN-IR0 (Thy1.2,
Ly5.2) and WT (Thy1.2, Ly5.1) CD8 T cells, cotransferred
these cells into intact (unirradiated) WT mice (Thy1.1),
and examined their activation/expansion in response to
LCMV infection. Because of the low frequency of precur-
sor cells in polyclonal populations, we used CD43 up-reg-
ulation as a marker to identify virus-specific CD8 T cells
(26). Fig. 8 C shows that the donor polyclonal WT CD8 T
cells generated far higher numbers of activated CD8 T cells
(CD43high) in response to infection than the polyclonal
IFN-IR0 donor CD8 T cells present in the same host (Fig.
8 C, middle). Thus, the IFN-I–mediated direct effect on T
cell expansion was not restricted to P14 or OT-1 trans-
genic CD8 T cells but was also seen on naive CD8 T cell
precursors that exist in extremely small numbers in a poly-
clonal population. Importantly, the ratio of IFN-IR0 to
WT naive (CD43low) CD8 T cells recovered from the
polyclonal donor populations was similar after infection
(Fig. 8 B, middle), reaffirming that the IFN-IR0 donor

CD8 T cells were neither rejected nor preferentially killed
by virus infection.
We next examined the expansion of P14 WT and IFN-
IR0 CD8 T cells in response to peptide immunization in
normal mice; i.e., mice that were not infected with LCMV
using IFN-I as an adjuvant (to mimic virally induced IFN-I).
The ratio of the recovered IFN-IR0 versus WT donor P14
CD8 T cells in unimmunized mice was roughly similar (Fig.
8 D, No immunization). After peptide immunization, both
IFN-IR0 and WT donor CD8 T cells expanded (Fig. 8 E),
but the expansion of WT P14 CD8 T cells was higher, espe-
cially with high-dose IFN-I administration. As a result, the
ratio of IFN-IR0 to WT cells decreased (Fig. 8 D, Peptide ϩ
High dose IFN-␣). In contrast, when IL-12 was used as the
adjuvant, the IFN-IR0 CD8 T cells expanded at least as well
as WT P14 donor cells (Fig. 8, E and D), indicating that
priming in the presence of IL-12 can overcome the defect
caused by IFN-IR deficiency on CD8 T cells. Collectively,
these results show that the diminished expansion of IFN-IR0
P14 CD8 T cells was caused by their specific inability to re-
spond to IFN-I and did not result from host-mediated rejec-
tion or viral infection of the cells.
IFN-Is promote clonal expansion by enhancing T cell survival
IFN-Is might control the clonal expansion of CD8 T cells by
increasing T cell activation, by increasing the number of naive
precursors recruited into the response, by enhancing the rate
or duration of their proliferation, and/or by augmenting the
survival of daughter cells in vivo. To assess these possibilities,
we cotransferred large numbers of WT and IFN-IR0 P14
CD8 T cells into naive congenic mice and analyzed activation
early after infection. Fig. 9 A shows that both WT and IFN-
IR0 cells up-regulated CD69 and CD25, down-regulated
L-selectin, and began to up-regulate CD44 as early as 24 h af-
ter infection. These findings suggested that WT and IFN-IR0
P14 CD8 T cells both responded early after infection. Analysis
of the recovered cells soon after infection showed that both
WT and IFN-IR0 P14 CD8 T cells were maintained at a
nearly equal ratio without expansion before 48 h after infec-
tion (Fig. 9 B). By 72 h, however, the WT P14 CD8 T cells
showed a marked increase over the IFN-IR0 P14 CD8 T cells
(Fig. 9 B). Thus, the differences observed in the expansion of
IFN-IR0 and WT CD8 T cells were not attributable to differ-
ences in early T cell activation or to differences in spontaneous
death soon after antigen encounter.

TYPE I IFNS ACT ON T CELLS TO ALLOW EXPANSION AND MEMORY | Kolumam et al.646
To seek direct information on proliferation during the
expansion phase, we transferred CFSE-labeled WT or IFN-
IR0 P14 CD8 T cells into naive congenic mice and analyzed
cell recruitment, proliferation, and recovery after LCMV in-
fection. Both WT and IFN-IR0 CD8 T cells remained
CFSE high in uninfected mice, indicating no spontaneous
cell division (Fig. 10 A, left). After LCMV infection, both
WT and IFN-IR0 P14 CD8 T cells were recruited into ex-
tensive proliferation at 66 h after infection (Fig. 10 A, mid-
dle). Surprisingly, the IFN-IR0 cells appeared to proliferate
at a faster rate than WT P14 CD8 cells (Fig. 10 A, middle),
perhaps because of the lack of antiproliferative effect that
IFN-I is known to exert on T cells (see Discussion). By 86 h,
both populations were CFSE low, which is indicative of
multiple cycles of proliferation (Fig. 10 A, right). To exam-
ine T cell proliferation at later stages, we assessed the propor-
tion of actively cycling cells in vivo by giving mice an injec-
tion of bromodeoxy-uridine (BrdU) at various days after
infection. Staining cells for BrdU incorporation at 12 h after
BrdU injection showed that cycling of WT and IFN-IR0
donor cells was very similar on day 5 after infection (Fig. 10
B). An extensive analysis of several mice in three different
experiments (Fig. 10 C) showed that (a) both IFN-IR0 and
WT cells continued to cycle until day 8 after infection, (b)
the proportion of cycling cells progressively decreased from
day 3 to 8 after infection among both IFN-IR0 and WT
cells, and (c) the IFN-IR0 cells were cycling at a slightly
higher rate compared with WT cells at the early phase of re-
sponse. Despite similar levels of recruitment and a higher
initial rate of proliferation, the expansion of IFN-IR0 P14
CD8 T cells was greatly reduced, indicating that most of the
daughter cells generated from IFN-IR0 P14 CD8 T cells
failed to survive.
Ex vivo assessment of side scatter at 66 h after infection
(high side scatter, dying, or dead cells) confirmed that a
greater proportion of IFN-IR0 P14 CD8 T cells were under-
going death (Fig. 10D). This finding was further confirmed
by demonstrating that a majority of cells with high side scatter
were annexin V positive (Fig. 10 D, R1 gate). In vitro culture
of WT and IFN-IR0 P14 effector CD8 T cells from day
5–infected mice showed that both populations were undergo-
ing spontaneous death, but the death was vastly increased in
IFN-IR0 cells (Fig. 10 E). Thus, IFN-I action on CD8 T cells
is critical for keeping the progeny of the effector CD8 T cells
alive. In the absence of IFN-I action, the antigen-experienced
effector CD8 T cells proliferate, but a majority of the progeny
derived from them undergoes rapid death.
DISCUSSION
Our study shows that the massive expansion of virus-specific
CD8 T cells seen in the acute phase of live viral infection is
critically dependent on survival signals provided by the di-
rect action of IFN-I on responding T cells. The naive CD8
T cell precursors recruited into response through appropriate
APCs proliferate rapidly, but the decision of whether their
progeny should live or die is dependent on their exposure to
IFN-I, a set of innate cytokines produced after infection.
Previous studies suggested that antigen-experienced CD8 T
cells undergo programmed expansion (which is a cumulative
outcome of proliferation plus survival of the daughter cells)
for several days after infection of mice with Listeria monocyto-
genes, even if the bacterium was eliminated by antibiotic
treatment within the first 24–48 h (27–29). Whether this ex-
pansion was programmed in a cell-intrinsic way or whether
cell-extrinsic factors play a role remained unclear. Our stud-
ies highlight that T cell proliferation and survival are interde-
pendently regulated by separate stimuli (i.e., proliferation by
cognate TCR interaction and survival by inflammatory
stimuli) and may be differentially programmed under the
conditions of viral infection. Whether a brief exposure to
IFN-I is sufficient for maintaining the effector T cell survival
or whether the effector cells need continuous exposure to
IFN-I in order to remain alive requires further investigation.
It is generally viewed that the effects of IFN-I on clonal
expansion in vivo are related largely via their actions on
APCs and to some extent via skewing activated T cells to-
ward a type I cytokine response (6–15). Our studies high-
light a previously unappreciated role for IFN-I in causing
clonal expansion via direct action on antigen-specific CD8 T
cells. We think this effect was not appreciated in previous
experiments that analyzed T cell responses directly in virally
infected IFN-IR0 mice (16), in which neither T cells nor
APCs can respond to IFN-I, possibly because (a) the infected
IFN-IR0 mice may elicit altered innate responses and (b) the
IFN-IR0 mice have a high persistent viral load that makes it
difficult to dissociate effects because of the absence of IFN-I
action from effects related to overwhelming viral loads (16,
17). For example, IFN-IR0 mice are known to elicit ele-
vated levels of IL-12 (which may overcome the defect
caused by IFN-IR0 deficiency on CD8 T cells; Fig. 8) be-
cause of the absence of an IFN-I–mediated IL-12 feedback
inhibition pathway (3). Additionally, other arms of the im-
mune system may also be affected in the IFN-IR0 host, de-
pending on the context, thus making it difficult to assess
what might be the effect that IFN-Is have on T cell response
under normal physiological conditions. A recent study re-
ported that IFN-IR0 mice can even elicit more enhanced
levels of CD8 T cell responses than WT mice during DNA
immunization, possibly because of deregulated control of IL-
10–producing suppressor cells (18). Our results suggesting
that IL-12 might contribute to overcoming the defect caused
by IFN-IR deficiency on CD8 T cells is further supported
by a recent study showing that purified naive CD8 T cells
stimulated in vitro with microspheres bearing MHC class
I/peptide Ag and B7-1 ligand expand and differentiate into
effectors in the presence of exogenously added IFN-I and that
exogenously added IL-12 can substitute for IFN-I in mediat-
ing this effect (15). Based on these results, together with the
observation that LCMV induces almost undetectable levels
of IL-12 (3), we would predict that the responding CD8 T
cells become less dependent on IFN-I–mediated signals un-
der the conditions that induce more IL-12 and less IFN-I.
JEM VOL. 202, September 5, 2005 647
ARTICLE
Consistent with this prediction, ongoing studies from our lab
indicate that in response to infection with recombinant vac-
cinia virus, as well as L. monocytogenes–expressing LCMV
GP33-41 epitope, the IFN-IR0 P14 CD8 T cells exhibit
‫%08ف‬ reduced expansion compared with the expansion of
WT P14 CD8 T cells in a WT host (unpublished data). This
suggests that the extent to which IFN-I contributes to T cell
expansion may be dependent on the type of pathogen and
the context of immunization. More comprehensive studies
are warranted to assess which factors contribute to T cell ex-
pansion in different types of infection.
Another striking observation of our study is the effect
that the IFN-I have on the generation of a memory pool.
The size of the memory pool generated from the IFN-IR0
effector CD8 T cells was ‫-001ف‬fold smaller than the mem-
ory CD8 T cell pool generated from WT P14 cells (Fig. 5).
The mechanisms that contribute to the generation of mem-
ory cells are poorly understood. Previous studies suggested
that antigen-experienced CD8 T cells undergo programmed
expansion for about 1 wk after infection and then undergo
programmed cell death irrespective of whether the antigen
persists or not (27–29). A proportion of effector CD8 T cells
that were able to up-regulate molecules such as IL-7R␣
chain, Spi2A, and CD8␣␣ homodimer (30–32) were shown
to have a better capacity to escape death and become mem-
ory precursor cells that will differentiate further in a progres-
sive manner in the absence of additional antigenic stimulus
into functional memory cells (33). Our results show that a
majority of the daughter cells derived from antigen-experi-
enced CD8 T cells undergo death in parallel to proliferation
during the acute phase of viral infection. Direct IFN-I action
rescues them from this death, thereby tilting the balance ef-
fectively toward clonal expansion. The IFN-I–mediated res-
cue from death during the antigen-driven proliferation is
critical not only for the expansion of effector cells, but also
for the expansion of memory precursors.
Why do the majority of IFN-I–responsive CD8 cells that
have received IFN-I–mediated signals and survived until day
8 still undergo massive contraction afterwards? One possibil-
ity is that these cells begin death because the IFN-I–medi-
ated survival signals become limited by this time. Indeed, the
serum IFN-I levels usually peak by day 3 and reach baseline
levels by about day 7 (34). An alternative possibility is that
the effector T cells may become progressively refractory to
IFN-I–mediated signals, especially after the withdrawal of
antigenic exposure and they may now need survival signals
provided by other factors such as IL-7 and IL-15. Exposure
to IFN-I is shown to cause down-regulation of IFN-IR ␣
chain in primary human CD34ϩ bone marrow cells and in
several human cell lines of diverse origin (35–36). Whether
similar receptor downmodulation/desensitization occurs in
activated effector CD8 T cells requires further investigation.
Alternatively, it is possible that the precipitous death of the
CD8 T cells after the peak expansion may be caused by a
completely unrelated event, including homeostatic compen-
satory mechanisms (37). Indeed, we were unable to prevent
WT P14 effector CD8 T cell death by exogenous IFN-I
treatment on day 8 after infection (unpublished data; Shau-
lov, A., personal communication), strengthening the latter
possibilities. The memory cells generated from the IFN-I–
unresponsive effector CD8 T cells, albeit low in number,
were maintained stably for extended periods, indicating that
the IFN-I–mediated signals required for survival during the
antigen-driven proliferation become dispensable once the
antigen–driven proliferation ceases and the cells differentiate
into resting memory cells.
Why is IFN-I action on T cells so important when there
are several other cytokines available in vivo? Although various
inflammatory cytokines have been historically used to increase
effector T cell survival in vitro and in vivo by exogenous ad-
ministration, their direct role on T cells under the normal phys-
iological conditions of an immune response to infection is be-
coming apparent only from recent experiments. Naive CD8 T
cells stimulated in vitro produce IL-2, which is known to pro-
vide antiapoptotic signals to the T cells. However, IL-2 is pro-
duced only transiently in vivo. Recent studies show that T cells
that cannot respond to IL-2 exhibit only modestly diminished
expansion under the conditions of viral infections (38, 39). A
recent study suggested that CD8 T cells that lack IFN-␥ recep-
tor exhibit nearly 2–4-fold decreased expansion compared with
WT cells in response to LCMV infection (40). Surprisingly, in
our study, the IFN-IR0 CD8 T cells, despite having an intact
IFN-␥ receptor, exhibit strikingly diminished expansion, sug-
gesting that IFN-␥ signals alone cannot rescue the deficiency
caused by IFN-IR deficiency. This may be related to the fact
that prior IFN-I exposure contributes to optimal IFN-␥ action,
as proposed in previous experiments (41).
Another factor that may influence the dependence on
IFN-I is the type of cell that displays antigen. Under the
conditions of viral infection, a majority of antigen-specific
CD8 T cells that were recruited into response via activated
professional APCs may subsequently encounter several in-
fected cell types that are not necessarily professional APCs.
Many of these infected targets, although deficient in the ex-
pression of the costimulatory molecules/inflammatory cy-
tokines typical of professional APCs, are capable of produc-
ing IFN-I. We predict that repetitive exposure of the
antigen-experienced T cells to these “nonprofessional” tar-
gets may lead to activation-induced cell death, but the IFN-I
produced in response to infection may help in tilting the
balance from cell death to survival/expansion. This may en-
sure continued expansion of antigen-experienced T cells at
the time when the availability of professional APCs becomes
limited. The frequency and duration of antigen-experienced
T cell encounters with such infected nonprofessional targets
is likely to be higher under the conditions of infection with
noncytopathic viruses such as LCMV.
Continued production of such inflammatory signals under
the conditions of persistent infection is likely to be deleterious
to the host, because this may allow uncontrollable expansion
of effector T cell progeny that may result in immune-medi-
ated pathology. Consistent with this, IFN-Is are induced in a
TYPE I IFNS ACT ON T CELLS TO ALLOW EXPANSION AND MEMORY | Kolumam et al.648
large burst in the acute phase of viral infection but do not
continue to be produced in such large amounts at later phases
if the virus establishes persistent infection (42). This raises the
question of whether the activation-induced cell death and
functional exhaustion of T cells that is typically seen under the
conditions of persisting viral load (43–45) is related, at least in
part, to the diminished availability of IFN-I–mediated survival
signals and warrants further investigations.
The level of IFN-I produced and the expansion of CD8
T cells in response to LCMV infection are considerably
higher compared with the levels produced in response to
other viral and intracellular bacterial infections (e.g., vaccinia
virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and L. monocytogenes) (1, 3,
8, 28). Based on the remarkable effect that IFN-I has on
CD8 T cell expansion, we predict that the robustness of T
cell responses elicited in response to various infections may
be related, at least in part, to the level of IFN-I produced.
How do IFN-Is prevent T cell death? IFN-Is were origi-
nally discovered as antiviral and antiproliferative cytokines and
are shown to exert opposing functions on cell survival or
death, depending on the context of its action, the type of cell,
and the stage of the cell (5, 12, 25, 46–47). IFN-Is are also
known to delay cell cycle progression from G0/G1 to S phase
(48). Previous experiments showed that activated T cells,
when cultured in vitro in the presence of IFN-I, survive bet-
ter and that this increased survival was not associated with ele-
vated levels of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL (12). This suggests that IFN-I
may confer survival signals via a pathway that is distinct from
that induced by members of the IL-2 family or CD28 engage-
ment. Consistent with this, we find that the IFN-IR0 CD8 T
cells expressed at least as much bcl-2 and IL-7R␣ chain as
WT CD8 T cells at various time points after infection (Fig.
S1, A and B, available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/
full/jem.20050821/DC1). It is also possible that IFN-I might
enhance T cell survival via induction/up-regulation of recep-
tors for other cytokine families. For example, previous experi-
ments indicated that IFN-I enhances memory CD8 T cell
proliferation via induction of IL-15, a cytokine that is shown
to maintain proliferative renewal of memory CD8 T cells
(49). We think the IFN-I–mediated survival of the effector
cells is unlikely to be mediated via the IL-15 pathway because
previous studies show that IL-15R ␣ chain–deficient and IL-
15–deficient mice elicit potent CD8 T cell expansion after
LCMV infection (49–50).
Interestingly, the antiproliferative signaling pathway acti-
vated by IFN-I has some level of cross talk with TCR signal-
ing via the P53 pathway (51–52). Our observation that IFN-
IR0 P14 CD8 cells recovered at 66 h after infection display
more advanced division history than WT P14 CD8 T cells
(Fig. 7 A) indicates that IFN-I may be applying brakes on T
cell proliferation, at least in the beginning of response. Rapid
division usually accompanies DNA duplication errors. DNA
repair mechanisms are generally more efficient during the G1/S
phase. It was proposed that continuous division with shorter
intermitotic times might reduce the efficiency by which DNA
repairs occur (53). This raises the question of whether IFN-I
increases cell survival by applying brakes to uncontrollable cell
proliferation and warrants further investigation.
In summary, our study shows that IFN-Is, a set of innate
cytokines produced in response to viral infection, act directly
on antigen-specific CD8 T cells to allow their clonal expan-
sion. IFN-Is mediate this process by prolonging the survival
of effector CD8 T cells. The IFN-I–mediated survival dur-
ing the antigen-driven proliferation phase is critical for gen-
eration of optimal numbers of memory CD8 T cells. This
knowledge will have broad implications for further under-
standing the role of IFN-Is in sustaining T cell survival dur-
ing vaccination/therapeutic strategies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice. IFN-IR–deficient mice on a 129/SvEv background (16) were back-
crossed to B6 for 14 generations. P14 and OT-1 TCR transgenic mice that
were on a B6 background were bred to B6 Ly5.1 mice to generate mice cells
with a congenic marker. C57BL/6 (Thy1.2) and C57BL/6 (Thy1.1) mice
were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Male or female mice at 4–12 wk
of age were used for experiments. All mice were maintained under specific
pathogen-free conditions at the University of Washington animal care facility
under the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Antibodies and staining. All antibodies, except anti–granzyme B, were
purchased from either BD Biosciences or eBioscience. Anti–human
granzyme B was purchased from Caltag. Intracellular staining was done by
culturing the cells for 5 h in a CO2 incubator at 37ЊC in the presence of
brefeldin A, followed by surface and intracellular staining using a Cytofix/
Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) as previously described (1). BrdU staining
was done using a BrdU flow kit (BD Biosciences). Mice were injected with
200 ␮g BrdU 12 h before analysis.
Purification of CD8 T cells and adoptive transfers. CD8 T cells
were purified by negative sorting using a cell sorter (FACSVantage; Beck-
ton Dickinson) after staining with a mixture of antibodies against CD4,
B220, CD11c, and CD19. All adoptive cell transfers were done i.v.
CFSE labeling. Cells were washed two times with serum-free medium,
followed by incubation with 5 ␮M CFSE for 7 min, quenching with 20%
FCS, and washing with RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS.
Virus and immunizations. LCMV strain Armstrong was plaque purified,
grown in baby hamster kidney cells, and titered on Vero cells. 2 ϫ 105 PFU
LCMV was injected into mice 24–48 h after cell transfer. Doses of universal
IFN-I (IFN-␣; PBL Biomedical Laboratories) or murine recombinant IL-12
(R&D Systems) were mixed with peptide in a volume of 200 ␮l PBS and in-
jected i.p and s.c on days 0 and 2, as indicated in the figures.
Online supplemental material. Fig. S1 shows that IFN-IR0 CD8 T
cells expressed at least as much bcl-2 and IL-7R␣ chain as did WT CD8 T
cells at various time points after infection. Online supplemental material is
