The graft-vs.-host reaction (GVHR) 1 is initiated by immune responses of donor T
lymphocytes to allogeneic histocompatibility antigens of the recipient. These initial
reactions cause a chain of complex and sometimes antagonistic events that can result
in various pathological symptoms. One possible outcome of the GVHR is acute GVH
disease (GVHD). It is caused by donor T cells (1-3) and produces thymic involution
(1) and severe hypoplasia of the lympho-hemopoietic tissue (1, 4), including depletion
of plasma cells in the gut (5). The resulting clinical symptoms of acute GVHD
comprise aplastic anemia (1), severe immunodeficiency, including hypogammaglob-
ulinemia (1, 6), and, finally, sepsis. Often, acute GVHD terminates as lethal GVHD
(LGVHD). A different possible outcome of the GVHR is chronic GVHD. This is a
pleiotropic syndrome, which can manifest itself by lymphoid hyperplasia, hypergam-
maglobulinemia, autoantibody formation, and/or symptoms of collagen disease (4,
7-9). The mechanisms that determine whether donor T cells will induce acute or
chronic GVHD and the pathological symptoms associated with them are poorly
understood. Alloreactive T cells are known to consist of functionally distinct subsets
that can be separated, for instance, on the basis of differences in their Lyt phenotypes
(10, 11). Conceivably, the different and sometimes diametrically opposed pathological
symptoms of GVHR are due to differences in subpopulations of the alloreactive donor

1502 ALLOSUPPRESSOR T CELLS IN LETHAL GRAFT-VS.-HOST DISEASE
T cells administered to the recipients. Thus far, however, there is only little experi-
mental data supporting this concept (12-15). Several authors have implicated T killer
(TK) cells of the donor as the main effeetor cells that kill the recipients in LGVHD
(16-19). This straightforward explanation has recently been questioned, however, and
it has been suggested that alloreactive T suppressor (TS) cells are the main effector
cells causing LGVHD (13, 14).
In the present study, a novel experimental approach was chosen for preparing two
inocula of syngeneic T cells that were enriched for allosuppressor and allohelper cells,
respectively. T cells from C57BI/10ScSn (B 10) donors were first activated for different
times, either 5 or 6 d, in the spleens of irradiated (B10 × DBA/2)F1 (1° F1) mice, and
then assayed for their anti-F1 activities by transferring them to secondary F1 (2° F1)
mice or testing them in vitro. Although donor T cells activated for 5 d were found to
be enriched for alloreactive TS cells, T cells activated for 6 d were enriched for
alloreactive T helper (TH) cells. Although both day-5- and day-6-activated T cells
were equally capable of lysing F1 target cells in vitro, nevertheless, upon transfer to
nonirradiated 2° F1 mice, only day-5-activated T cells induced LGVHD. Day-6-
activated T cells, on the other hand, induced symptoms of chronic GVHD upon
transfer to nonirradiated 2° F1 mice.
Materials and Methods
Mice. B10 mice and (B10 × DBA/2)F1 hybrids were purchased from the TNO Laboratory
(Zeist, The Netherlands). The B10 donors were males or females, 6-12-wk old. The 1° Fl
recipients (Fig. 1) were males or females 10-12 wk old, and the 2° FI recipient mice were males
or females 8-12 wk old. In a given experiment, all mice were of the same sex.
Irradiation of Mice. Mice were subjected to 750 rad total body irradiation by applying 662
KeV gamma rays, emitted from a laTCssource (Gammator, model 381, Isomedic) at a dose of
375 rad/min. Within the next 3 h, the mice were injected with the cells indicated.
Preparationand Testing of Day-5- and Day-6-Activated Anti-F1 T Cells. Single-cell suspensions of
spleen cells were prepared as described (13). Spleen cells enriched for T cells were obtained by
passage over nylon wool (20). The basic experimental design for preparing day-5- and day-6-
activated parental T cells and for testing their capacities to induce LGVHD is depicted in Fig.
1. In experiments in which the effects of the activated T cells on erythropoiesis or on antibody
formation to levan were studied, smaller numbers of activated cells were transferred to
irradiated 2° recipients of F1 or B10 origin (other than shown in Fig. 1).
Complement (C)-dependent Cytotoxiclty Test. The trypan-blue exclusion method was used. A 1
in 1,000 dilution of the monoclonal anti-Thy-1.2 antibody was used for the determination of T
cells. Cells of F1 origin were identified with a 1 in 10 dilution of a B10 anti-DBA/2 and a
DBA/2 anti-B10 alloantiserum, respectively, which were prepared by repeated injections of
lymphoid cells. The Lyt phenotypes of activated B10 cells were determined with anti-Lyt-1.2
and anti-Lyt-2.2 sera, respectively, at a dilution of 1 in 10. As a source of C we used a 1 in 12
dilution of serum obtained from selected rabbits.
Cell-mediated Lymphocytotoxicity (CML) Test. Two different experimental protocols were
applied to assess the 4-h CML activity of day-5- and day-6-activated B10 T cells. In the first
protocol, the activated T cells obtained from the spleens of the 1° F1 mice were cultured for 18
h without the addition of stimulator cells and then tested by CML. In the second protocol, 1.2
× 107 day-5- or day-6-activated cells were first restimulated by mixing them with 1.2 × 107 F~
spleen cells irradiated with 3,300 rad. The cell mixtures were cultured for 5 d at a 5-ml volume
in tissue-culture flasks (3013; Falcon Labware, Div. of Becton, Dickenson & Co., Oxnard, CA).
The restimulated cells were then tested by CML. The culture conditions, determination of 4-h
CML activity, and inhibition of CML activity by unlabeled target cells were the same as
described elsewhere (13).

FiG. 1. Experimental design for the preparation and testing of day-5- and day-6-activated B10 T
ceils. On day zero, 50 × 106 splenic T cells from BI0 donors were injected into H-2-incompatible
irradiated (BI0 × DBA/2)F1 hybrids, termed primary Fj (1° F1) mice. Cells were recovered from
the spleens of 1° F1 mice, either on day 5 or day 6; they were termed day-5-activated and day-6-
activated B 10 T cells, respectively. For assessment of the functional capacities of day-5- and day-6-
activated T cells, cells of either population were transferred to secondary (2°) recipients. When the
capacities of the two populations of activated parental T cells for induction of LGVHD were to be
studied, 3 × 10v live cells of either population were transferred into nonirradiated FI (2° Fj)
recipients (see figure). In experiments in which the effects of day-5 and day-6 cells on erythropoiesis
or antibody production were studied, smaller numbers of day-5 and day-6 cells, along with other
cells, were transferred into irradiated 2° recipients, as described in the text. Alternatively, different
numbers of activated T cells were studied in vitro.
Quantitationof MouseIgG in the Supernatantsof CulturedSpleen Cellsand in the Serum. This assay
was performed as described (13).
Determination of Hemopoiesis by Incorporationof 5eFe. This assay was performed as described
(21).
Anti-Levan Plaque-formin~Cell (PFC) Response. Irradiated 2° recipient mice were repopulated
intravenously with 3 X 10 T cell-depleted spleen cells and various numbers of day-5- or day-6-
activated B10 cells. 2 d later, the mice were injected intravenously with 10 p,g levan. 5 d after
injection of the T cell-independent antigen levan, the spleens of the mice were removed, and
1504 ALLOSUPPRESSOR T CELLS IN LETttAI, GRAFT-VS.-ItOST DISEASE
the direct PFC responses of individual mice were determined by applying a Jerne-plaque assay
with levan-coupled sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) (22).
Ig Allotype. Antisera specific for the Ig-Ib allotype of B10 and the Ig-1c allotype of DBA/2,
respectively, were prepared as described (23). The anti-Ig-1c serum was used at a constant
dilution of 1 in 3 and the anti-Ig-1h serum at a constant dilution of 1 in 9. The relative
concentrations of Ig allotypes in the sera of 2° F1 recipients of day-6 cells were determined by
double-immunodiffusion in agar gel. The sera of 2° F1 mice were tested at doubling dilutions
starting at 1 in 8. The titer of the highest serum dilution that gave a precipitation line was
recorded.
Pathological Examination. At autopsy, organs were removed and fixed in 8% phosphate-
buffered formalin (pH 7.4), embedded in paraffin, and cut at 5 p,m. Sections stained with
hematoxylin-eosin or Giemsa stain were prepared.
Immunofluorescence and Immunoperoxidase Examination. Indirect immunofluorescence staining
was performed on frozen sections of lymph nodes and spleens of the 2° F1 recipients. For the
determination of T cells, a suitably absorbed rabbit-anti-mouse brain serum was used in
combination with a horse-anti-rabbit IgG labeled with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate
(17-2T2; Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service [CLB],
Amsterdam). Direct immunofluorescence staining was used for the determination of B cells and
plasma cells, applying a rabbit-anti-mouse Ig serum labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate
(KM 16-11; CLB, Amsterdam).
Immunoperoxidase studies for the detection of intracytoplasmic Ig in plasma cells and
plasma-cell precursors in the lamina propria of the upper part of the small bowel (duodenum
and jejunum) were performed in paraffin sections, pretreated with protease (type VII; Sigma
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) (24). Rabbit antisera against mouse IgG, IgA, and IgM (Miles
Laboratories, Elkhart, IN) were diluted 1 in 20 (IgG) and 1 in 10 (IgA and IgM), respectively.
Swine-anti-rabbit serum (Dakopatts, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used in a dilution of 1 in 40,
and the peroxidase-antiperoxidase complex produced in swine (Dakopatts) was diluted 1 in 50.
All dilutions were made in normal swine serum (Dakopatts).
PrimaryPFC ResponsesagainstSRBC In Vitro. 3 X 10~normal spleen or T cell-depleted spleen
cells were cultured in volumes of 300 p.l together with various numbers of day-5- or day-6-
activated B I0 cells or "activated" T cells of F1 origin. The latter were nylon wool-passaged Ft
spleen cells injected into 1o Fx mice and recovered from their spleens on day 5 or day 6. Cultures
were performed in Falcon multi-well tissue-culture plates (3008; Falcon Labware). The culture
medium consisted of sodium-bicarbonate-buffered RPMI 1640 supplemented with e-glutamine
(2 raM), 2-mercaptoethanol (2 X 10-s M), streptomycin (50 U/ml), penicillin (50 U/ml), and
10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The cultures were immunized with 2.5 x l0s SRBC. On day 4, the
numbers of direct PFC were determined in a Jerne-plaque assay. Triplicate cultures were set
up for each determination.
Preparationof T Cell-depletedSpleenCells (B Cells). B cells were prepared by incubating spleen
cells with monoclonal anti-Thy-l.2 (clone F7D5; Olac 1976 Ltd., Bicester, United Kingdom)
and C, as previously described (13). Thereafter, the cells were washed three times and viable T
cells determined by indirect immunofluorescence with an appropriately absorbed rabbit anti-
mouse-brain serum in combination with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled swine-anti-
rabbit IgG (F2190; Dakopatts). The proportion of T cells never exceeded 1%.
Statistical Significance. Student's t test was applied.
Results
Serological Characterization of Day-5- and Day-6-activated Cells. The absolute numbers
of live cells recovered from the spleens of 1° F1 mice on day 5 did not differ from those
recovered on day 6. On both days, the recovery per spleen varied from 1.4 × 107 to
2.1 × 107 cells in different experiments. About 90% of the live cells recovered on both
days 5 and 6 were T cells of B10 origin (Table I). Viable cells of FI origin, as
determined by a cytotoxic antiserum against DBA/2, were undetectable among both
day-5 and day-6 cells. Therefore, the two cell populations were termed day-5- and

different from those found among day-5-activated T cells (Table I).

Such 2° F1 recipients showed characteristic symptoms of acute GVHD, such as
reduced body weight and hematocrit, a decreased level of serum IgG, and a decreased
number of cells in their spleens (Tables II and III). In marked contrast, none of the
2° Fa recipients of day-6-activated T cells died from or showed clinical symptoms of
acute GVHD (Fig. 2, Table II). However, at 2 wk after the transfer of day-6-activated
T cells, the 2° F1 recipients showed splenomegaly and a slight increase in the number
of cells in their spleens (Table III). Typing of these cells in a C-dependent cytotoxicity
test, applying an anti-Bl0 and an anti-DBA/2 serum, showed that at least 90% were
of F1 origin (data not shown). Furthermore, the injection of day-6 cells caused a
considerable increase in the serum IgG level of 2° F1 recipients (Table II). By applying
an anti-Ig-1 b and an Ig-1c serum for immunoprecipitation in agar gel, it was
demonstrated that the levels of both Ig-1 allotypes were increased in the sera of 2° F1
recipients of day-6 cells (data not shown). This indicated that at least a major portion
of the increased serum IgG level in these mice was produced by B cells of the 2° F1
mice, which were Ig-1b/c, and not by B cells of B10 origin (Ig-lb/b). When syngeneic
(B 10) mice instead of F1 mice were used as 2° recipients, neither day-5 nor day-6 cells
induced clinical abnormalities (Table II).
Morphological Findings in the Lympho-Hemopoietic Tissues of 2 ° Recipients. Inoculation
of day-5-activated T cells into 2° F1 recipients caused a progressive hypoplasia of the
peripheral lymphoid tissues and the thymus. Immunofluorescence studies of T and B
cells in the spleens and lymph nodes of such 2° F~ recipients showed that virtually all
of the few lymphoid cells present were T cells. In contrast, inoculation of day-6-
activated T cells into 2° Fa mice caused stimulation of the peripheral lymphoid tissues
and no involution of the thymus. The lymphoid stimulation induced by day-6 cells
was already present 10 d after the cell transfer and, in five out of six 2° FI recipients
studied, persisted for at least 3 mo. Immunofluorescence studies of the stimulated
spleens and lymph nodes of 2° F1 recipients of day-6 cells showed that the T cell areas
and, especially, the B cell areas, were stimulated.
In control experiments, syngeneic (B10) mice, instead of F1 mice, served as 2°
recipients of day-5 and day-6 cells, respectively. Neither lymphoid hypoplasia nor
thymus involution were observed in these recipients; however, both day-6 and day-5
ROLINK ET AL. 1507
cells induced a moderate and transient lymphoid stimulation, which had disappeared
at day 40 after the cell transfer. There are at least three possible, mutually not
exclusive explanations for this transient lymphoid stimulation: (a) small numbers of
F1 cells might have been co-transferred from the 1° F~ animals to the 2° BI0 mice
and might thus have provided an alloantigenic stimulus; (b) the alloactivated B10 T
cells themselves might have picked Fa antigens (25) that then elicited an immune
response in the 2° B10 mice; (c) the 2° B10 recipients might have responded to
idiotypic receptors on the alloactivated syngeneic T cells (26).
After the injection of day-5 cells, hemopoiesis in the bone marrow of 2° F1 recipients
was moderately suppressed after 10 d (Fig. 3 A) and was no longer detectable after 20
d. However, a conspicuous depletion in the numbers of the reticular fibroblasts in the
marrow was undetectable in the 2° F~ recipients of day-5 cells (nor were such changes
detectable in any other group). In all 2° Fa mice injected with day-6 cells, by contrast,
the bone marrow showed fully developed hemopoiesis at days 10, 20, 30, and 90 (Fig.
3 B). No hypoplastic changes were detectable in the bone marrow of syngeneic (B10)
recipients of either day-5 or day-6 cells.
Morphological Findings in the Gut and Other Organsof 2 ° Recipients. Whereas in the 2°
F1 recipients of day-5 cells there was a progressive disappearance of plasma cells and
their precursors in the lamina propria of the small bowel, no such changes were found
in the 2° Fa recipients of day-6 cells. In both groups, however, small foci of
lymphocytes, obviously invading the epithelium, were found in the crypts. In addition,
villous edema and focal superficial epithelial necrosis were present in these areas. In
contrast, the injection of neither day-5 nor day-6 cells changed the number of plasma
cells or caused epithelial lesions in the intestinal villi of syngeneic (B10) recipients.
The above-mentioned histological findings were confirmed by the results of im-
munoperoxidase staining. After the injection of day-5 cells, the 2° F1 recipients showed
a progressive depletion of IgG-, IgM-, and IgA-containing plasma cells and plasma-
cell precursors in the lamina propria of the gut (Fig. 4A). In contrast, at all times
after the transfer of day-6 cells, the guts of 2° F1 animals contained numerous cells
cytoplasmically positive for IgA, IgM, or IgG (Fig. 4 B). Both day-5 and day-6 cells
failed to change the number of isotypes of Ig-producing ceils in the gut of syngeneic
(B10) recipients. 20 d after the cell transfer, the 2° F1 recipients of day-5 cells but not
those of day-6 cells showed histological signs of sepsis in that bacterial colonies without
inflammatory reaction were found in the liver and other parenchymal organs.
Lack of Difference in Anti-F1 TK Cell Activity between Day-5- and Day-6-activated
Cells. Both day-5- and day-6-activated B10 T cells lysed F1 target cells in vitro but
failed to lyse syngeneic (B10) target cells (Fig. 5). When day-5 and day-6 cells were
restimulated for 5 d with irradiated Fa spleen cells in vitro before being tested by
CML, they had retained their cytotoxic anti-F1 activity, but again we did not lind
that the anti-F1 TK cell activity of day-6 cells was inferior to that of day-5 cells (data
not shown). Cold-target inhibition studies indicated that the anti-F~ TK cell activity
of both day-5 and day-6-activated B10 (H-2b/b) T cells was specific for the H-2d
antigens of (B10 × DBA/2)F1 (H-2b/d) mice. Specificity for non-H-2 antigens was not
observed (data not shown). As far as the anti-H-2~ specificity of day-5-activated B 10
TK cells is concerned, the results of cold-target inhibition studies were reported
elsewhere (13).

Fro. 6. Opposite effects of day-5 and day-6-activated T cells upon the IgG production by spleen
cells of 2° Ft recipients. Nonirradiated 2° F1 animals received either 3 × 107 day-5-activated or 3
× 107 day-6-activated T cells. After 14 d, the spleens of 2° Fl mice were excised, and 2.5 × l0Tcells
of each mouse were cultured overnight. The IgG concentrations in the culture supernatants were
determined and expressed as the percentage of IgG concentration found in cultures containing
spleen cells of noninjected Fl mice. (The 100% value corresponds to 1l 250 ng IgG). Each group
consisted of five F~ mice. Columns represent the arithmetic mean; vertical bars represent 1 SEM.
on the IgG Productionby Spleen Cells of 2 o ['1 Mice. Groups of nonirradiated 2° F1 mice
were injected with 3 × 107 day-5- or day-6-activated cells. After 14 d, the spleen cells
of the 2° F1 recipients were assayed in vitro for the amount of IgG released into the
culture supernatant. Spleen cells obtained from day-5-injected 2° F1 recipients
produced only about one-fourteenth of the IgG produced by the same number of cells
obtained from day-6-injected 2° F1 recipients (Fig. 6). However, the absolute number
of cells in the spleen of 2° F1 mice injected with day-6 cells was more than three times
higher as the number of cells found in 2° FI recipients of day-5 cells (Table III).
Therefore, when the IgG production was calculated on the basis of whole spleens, the
difference in IgG production between those 2° Fa mice injected with day-5 cells and
those injected with day-6 cells was even 40- to 50-fold. These data are consistent with

studied in irradiated 2° F1 mice. In the first experiment (Fig. 7), all seven groups of
2° F1 mice were repopulated with a standard number of 3 × 107 nonirradiated spleen
cells from syngeneic F1 donors. Six groups received graded numbers of day-5- or day-
6-activated T cells in addition. All three groups of the repopulated 2° F1 mice that
had received day-5 cells exhibited a dose-dependent suppression of the PFC response.
In these three groups, the PFC responses were significantly lower (P < 0.002) than
those of 2° FI control mice. In contrast, day-6 cells, at doses of 1.25 × 106 and 5 × 106
cells, did not induce a significant suppression (P > 0.15). Although the PFC response

of the control mice, it was still significantly higher (P < 0.01) than the response of the
group injected with day-5 cells.
Next, we investigated whether day-5 cells were also able to suppress the anti-levan
response of syngeneic (BI0) cells in an F1 environment, Irradiated 2 ° F1 mice were
therefore repopulated with a standard number of 3 × 107 spleen cells of B10 origin.
To prevent GVH effects by the repopulating B 10 spleen cells themselves, we used B 10
spleen cells that were depleted of T cells ("B" cells). In addition to receiving BI0 B
cells, 6 groups of the 2 ° F1 mice received graded numbers of day-5- or day-6-activated
B10 T cells. In the environment of the irradiated 2 ° F1 recipients, day-5-activated
ROLINK ET AL. 1513
B10 T cells were capable of suppressing the PFC response of B10 B cells (Fig. 8).
Surprisingly, however, even day-6-activated T cells at doses of 2.5 and 5 × 106 cells
caused a significant (P < 0.05) suppression of syngeneic B cells in 2° F1 recipients.
The Different Capacities of Day-5- and Day-6-activated B I O T Cellsfor Induction of Positive
and Negative Allogeneic Effects In Vitro. Helper effects of activated B10 T cells upon the
primary anti-SRBC response of F1 B cells ("allohelp") were assayed by culturing
graded numbers of day-5 or day-6 cells with 3 X 106 unprimed Fx B cells and SRBC.
The help supplied by day-6 cells was considerably higher than that induced by day-
5 cells. However, day-5 cells, too, were able to induce allohelp because many fewer
day-5-activated B 10 T cells than syngeneic T cells were needed for providing help to
the F1 B cells. Moreover, day-6 cells at doses of 2 × 105 and higher were also able to
suppress F1 B cells, when compared with syngeneic T cells (Fig. 9).
In another experiment (Fig. 10), the suppressor effect of activated B10 T cells upon
the primary anti-SRBC response of F1 spleen cells ("allosuppression") was tested. To
this end, 3 X 106 unprimed Fa spleen cells (instead of the Fa B cells as used in the
previous experiment) were cultured with graded numbers of day-5 or day-6 cells and
SRBC. Addition of very small numbers of day-5 cells already induced a distinct
suppression of the PFC response by F1 spleen cells: the addition of only 103 day-5 cells
suppressed almost 50% of the PFC response. This suppression of the response became
more profound when higher numbers of day-5 cells were added to the cultures.
Although day-6 cells, too, were able to suppress the response, this occurred only at cell
numbers of 32 × 103 and higher, and then the extent of suppression was significantly
lower (P < 0.03) than that induced by day-5 cells. No suppression was observed when
day-5- or day-6-activated B10 T cells were added to syngeneic B10 spleen cells (Fig.
9). This indicates that, for suppression to occur, allorecognition by the activated T
cells had to be possible. The finding that addition of 0.25 to 64 × 103 "activated" F1

cells, as indicated. On day 7, the amount of 59Feuptake in the spleens of the repopulated mice was
determined. Each group consisted of five Fl mice. Results are expressed as described for Fig. l 1.
T cells to the F1 spleen cells likewise failed to suppress the PFC response (data not
shown) is consistent with this conclusion.
The Different Capacities of Day-5- and Day-6-activated BIO T Cells for Suppression of
E~ythropoietic ['1 Cells. Before the effects of day-5- and day-6-activated parental T
cells upon the hemopoietic activity of BMC could be studied, we had to exclude the
possibility that day-5 and day-6 cells themselves had a different erythropoietic activity.
Therefore, equal numbers (0.6 × 106 to 2.4 × 106) of day-5 or day-6 cells were injected
into groups of irradiated 2 ° F1 recipients, who did not receive any other cells. 7 d
later, the 59Fe incorporation into the spleen of the 2 ° F1 mice was determined. Neither
the 2 ° F1 recipients of day-5 cells nor those of day-6 cells contained a significantly
higher erythropoietic activity than unrepopulated 2 ° F1 mice (Table IV). Table IV
ROLINK ET AL. 1515
also shows the different repopulating capacities of F1 BMC and BI0 BMC. The
number of B10 BMC that was required to give a good SgFe uptake in the spleens of
the irradiated 2° F1 recipients, was 10 times as great as the number of Fa BMC. The
large number of B10 BMC was needed to overcome the F~ hybrid resistance of the
irradiated Fx mice to hemopoietic ceils of B 10 origin (27).
We then studied the effects of the two kinds of activated parental T cells on the
hemopoietic activity of the BMC taken to repopulate irradiated 2° F1 recipients.
Graded numbers of activated T cells (0.6 × 106 to 2.4 × 106) were injected into the
following kinds of irradiated 2° recipients: (a) F1 mice repopulated with 2 × 106 F1
BMC (Fig. 11); (b) F1 mice repopulated with 20 × I0n B10 BMC (Fig. 12), and (c)
B10 mice repopulated with 2 × 106 B10 BMC. As can be seen in Fig. 11, day-5- and
day-6-activated T ceils exerted opposite effects on the repopulation by F~ BMC of
irradiated F1 (2° Fx) mice. To test whether day-5-activated B10 T cells would also
suppress syngeneic B10 BMC in an Fx environment, protocol (b) was used. All doses
of day-5 cells markedly depressed the 59Fe uptake by syngeneic BMC (Fig. 12). By
contrast, day-5-activated B10 T cells failed to suppress, but stimulated the ~9Feuptake
of B10 BMC in the completely syngeneic environment described under (c) (data not
shown). In summary, the results of experiments (b) and (c) indicate that the nonspecific
suppression by day-5 cells of syngeneic B 10 BMC depended on the triggering of day-
5 cells by Fa alloantigens.
A surprising finding was that day-6-activated B 10 T cells, too, although they failed
to suppress erythropoietic cells of F1 origin (Fig. 11), did suppress the erythropoietic
activity of syngeneic BMC in an F1 environment (Fig. 12). In the absence of F1
antigens, however, neither day-5- nor day-6-activated B10 T cells suppressed the
erythropoiesis of B10 BMC, but rather stimulated it (data not shown).
Discussion
We prepared two functionally different subpopulations of alloactivated parental T
lymphocytes: day-5 cells, which were enriched for T cells inducing LGVHD, and
day-6 cells, which were unable to induce LGVHD (Fig. 2). In addition, upon transfer
to the nonirradiated 2° Fx mice, day-5-activated T cells suppressed the IgG production
by the recipients' spleen cells, whereas day-6-activated T cells increased it (Fig. 6).
Furthermore, upon transfer to nonirradiated 2° F1 mice, day-5 cells caused progressive
thymic atrophy and cellular depletion, especially of plasma cells, in the lympho-
hemopoietic tissues (Fig. 3 A). Concomitant clinical symptoms were aplastic anemia
and hypogammaglobulinemia (Table II). An important finding in the 2° F1 recipients
of day-5 cells was the virtually complete depletion of plasma cells and plasma-cell
precursors of the three major Ig classes in the lamina propria of the small intestine
(Fig. 4A). This, in combination with the observed epithelial lesions in the small
intestine, was the most likely cause of LGVHD and sepsis caused by day-5 cells.
Sprent and Miller (28) observed that a substantial portion of alloactivated parental
T cells eventually home to the intestinal villi of 2° Fa recipient mice. This observation
suggests that the depletion of plasma cells and plasma-cell precursors in the 2° F1
recipients of day-5 cells was because of a local immune response by the day-5-activated
T cells. Van Bekkum et al. (29) have demonstrated that the quality of the intestinal
microflora can decisively influence the mortality rate of mice undergoing GVHR. It
seems fair to conclude from the combined findings that the primary cause of GVH
1516 ALLOSUPPRESSORT CELLS IN LETHALGRAFT-VS.-HOSTDISEASE
mortality lies in the T ceil-induced pathological damage in several tissues, including
the gut. Thereafter, pathogenic microorganisms, invading from the damaged intestine
and infecting an immunodeficient organism, can play an important secondary role.
In marked contrast with day-5 cells, transfer of day-6 cells to 2° F~ mice caused
splenomegaly, lymphoid stimulation (especially of the F1 B cells), and hypergamma-
globulinemia (Tables II and III). An intriguing observation was that the lymphoid
tissue of almost all the 2° F1 recipients of day-6 cells remained stimulated throughout
the 3-mo observation period. Thus, the lymphoid stimulation induced by day-6-
activated B10 T cells did not rapidly return to normal or revert to the lymphoid
hypoplasia and pancytopenia that is characteristic of the acute GVHD induced in
identical F1 mice by the injection of nonactivated, unselected B10 spleen cells (14).
These results indicate that day-6-activated B10 T cells, in contrast to unselected B10
spleen cells and day-5-activated B10 T cells, had undergone an almost irreversible
reduction in those T cells that induce the suppressive pathological phenomena
characteristic of acute GVHD. These impressive functional differences between day-
5 and day-6 cells cannot be ascribed to differences in either the number of parental
T cells or the Lyt phenotypes expressed by them (Table I).
Mode of Elicitation and Specificity of AUosuppression and Allohelp. Apart from suppress-
ing the IgG production of nonirradiated 2° F1 recipients, day-5-activated T cells also
suppressed the anti-levan response (Figs. 7 and 8) and erythropoiesis (Figs. 11 and 12)
of irradiated and repopulated 2° Fa recipients. In addition, they suppressed the anti-
SRBC PFC response of F1 spleen cells cultured in vitro (Fig. 10). By contrast, day-6-
activated T cells, in spite of an identical capacity for killing F~ target cells, failed to
suppress (or only weakly suppressed) the anti-SRBC response of F1 spleen cells in
vitro (Fig. 10) and the anti-levan response and erythropoiesis of irradiated 2° F, mice
repopulated with Fa cells (Figs. 7 and 11). Correspondingly, we assume that the
decrease in erythropoiesis and antibody formation caused by day-5-activated B 10 cells
was the result of suppressive rather than cytotoxic activity. This assumption is based
on the observation that day-5 cells were able to reduce the erythropoiesis and antibody
formation not only of F~ cells (Figs. 7, 10 and 11) but also, at least to some extent,
that of syngeneic B 10 cells exposed to an F1 environment (Figs. 8 and 12). A reduction
in the functional activities of syngeneic cells cannot be ascribed to cytotoxicity (Fig.
5). The extremely low number of 0.5 × 103 day-5 cells that effectively reduced the
anti-SRBC response of 3 × 106 F1 spleen cells (Fig. 10) also tends to support the
notion that this effect was because of suppression rather than cytotoxicity.
The elicitation of eventually nonspecific suppressor activity depended on the
aliorecognition by the activated parental T cells of F1 antigens. Whereas day-5-
activated B 10 cells did suppress the erythropoietic activity of B 10 cells in irradiated
2° FI (Fig. 12), they completely failed to do so in the absence of F1 antigens. Further,
day-5-activated B10 cells did not suppress the primary anti-SRBC response of B10
spleen cells, whereas they suppressed the response of F1 spleen ceils (Fig. 10). Once it
was elicted, however, the suppressor activity could affect syngeneic B 10 cells as well
(Figs. 8 and 12). Comparable suppressor activities, triggered by specific T cell
allorecognition and nonspecifically affecting bystander cells, have previously been
reported by others (6, 30, 31). The suppression exerted by day-5 cells, nevertheless,
seemed to have a stronger effect on Fx cells than on syngeneic B 10 cells (Figs. 7 and
11 vs. 8 and 12). One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that nonspecific as
ROLINK ET AL. 1517
well as Fa-restricted TS cells or suppressor factors operate in our model. Schwartz et
al. (32) described the induction of both restricted and unrestricted TS cells during a
primary MLR, and it has been reported (33, 34) that both restricted and unrestricted
suppressor factors preventing cell proliferation were produced by or under the
influence of alloactivated T cells. Hence, it is conceivable that more than one type of
TS cell (or factor) was present among the day-5-activated T cells, one type that acted
specifically on F1 cells and another that acted nonspecifically in that it also suppressed
B10 cells. Another explanation for the stronger suppression of F1 cells could be that
the F1 cells, taken to repopulate the irradiated 2° F1 mice, provided a quantitatively
or qualitatively better antigenic stimulus for triggering the suppression by day-5 cells.
As far as the activity ofday-6-activated T cells in irradiated 2° F1 mice is concerned,
different results were found, depending on whether the antibody-forming and eryth-
ropoietic progenitor cells were of F1 or B10 origin. Whereas day-6 cells failed to
suppress or only marginally suppressed the antibody-forming and erythropoietic
activity of F~ cells (Figs. 7 and 11), they did suppress the antibody-forming and
erythropoietic activity of B10 cells (Figs. 8 and 12). At least two mechanisms, which
are mutually not exclusive, might account for this discrepancy. First, it is conceivable
that day-6 cells produced a helper factor that was specific for F1 cells but did not act
on B 10 cells. Hence, the suppressive effect also exerted by day-6 cells might have been
neutralized by an F~-specific helper factor (35) in those experiments where cells of F1
origin were used, but not in those where B10 cells were used. An Fl-restricted helper
effect (35, 36) might have neutralized the suppression by day-6 cells of both F~ B cells
and F1 erythropoietic progenitor cells because there is evidence that activated TH
cells release factor(s) stimulating both kinds of cells (37, 38). Second, cells from B10
(H-2b/b) donors are especially susceptible to F1 hybrid resistance in H-2bm recipients
(27, and Table IV). Although high numbers of B10 BMC were used to correct for
this, the susceptibility of B 10 BMC to the combined effect of F1 hybrid resistance and
allosuppression might have been greater than the susceptibility of small numbers of
FI BMC to allosuppression alone.
Possible Biological Mechanism Underlying the Enrichment of Alloreactive TS Cells on Day 5
and of TH Cells on Day 6. The switch from allosuppression to allohelp from day 5 to
day 6 was highly reproducible. Conceivably, the time dependency of this switch was
because of time differences in the splenic sojourn and recirculation of subsets of donor
T cells in the 1o F1 mice. Supposing that significant numbers of donor TS cells left
the spleens of 1° F~ mice between days 5 and 6, they might have left behind a
population of alloreactive donor cells enriched in TH cells. Sprent and Miller (28, 39)
previously studied the functional capacities of parental strain T cells that were
activated against the H-2 alloantigens of irradiated F~ animals. The overall conclusion
from their investigations is that donor T cells first home to the peripheral lymphoid
organs, including the spleen, where they proliferate and differentiate in response to
the alloantigens of the recipients. After a lag period of 3.5 days, the alloactivated T
cells start re-entering the circulation. Sprent and Miller (28) found that T cells that
were recovered from the circulation at 4-6 d after the injection into irradiated F1
mice had lost their specific ability to induce GVH splenomegaly when transferred to
nonirradiated 2° F1 mice. They further noticed that the same activated parental T
cells were strongly cytotoxic for F1 target cells in vitro. This finding of but a partial
anti-F1 reactivity of the recirculating parental T cells indicates that, indeed, only
1518 ALLOSUPPRESSORT CELLS IN LETHAL GRAFT-VS.-HOST DISEASE
selected subpopulations of the alloactivated donor T cells start to re-enter the
circulation of the Fa recipient around day 5. As far as the inability to induce GVH
splenomegaly and the capacity for anti-F1 cytotoxicity is concerned, the recirculating
parental T cells described by Sprent and Miller (28) resemble the day-5-activated
splenic T cells described in the present paper. However, an important difference was
the reported inability of the recirculating parental T cells to induce LGVHD or acute
GVHD upon transfer to 2° F1 mice (28). The reason for this difference is not known
:~t present. In the light of the T cell circuit (10), it is conceivable that the induction of
severe allosuppression and eventually LGVHD requires at least two subsets of
alloactivated parental T cells: (a) an effector cell population mediating allosuppression
that might have been present among both day-5 cells and the recirculating T cells,
and (b) an additional helper cell population that keeps inducing (10) the suppressor
effector cells. Possibly, this second subset of parental T cells does not recirculate and
thus was present only among the day-5 cells obtained from the spleens of the 1o FI
recipients, In any event, the early observation (28) that anti-Fx cytotoxicity of the
activated parental T cells is not sufficient for induction of acute GVHD and LGVHD
has long been overlooked by investigators in the field (16-19). This important
observation has been confirmed and extended by the data of the present study, as
discussed below.
Lack ofa Distinct Role of TK Cells in the Pathogenesisof LGVHD. Interestingly, day-5-
activated T cells and day-6-activated T cells had equal capacity to lyse F1 target cells
in vitro (Fig. 5). The good anti-F1 cytotoxicity of day-6 cells, which were incapable of
inducing LGVHD, indicated that donor TK cells are insufficient for induction of
LGVHD. Our concept that LGVHD is caused not by TK but by alloreactive TS cells
is further supported by theoretical considerations. In view of the tremendous regener-
ative capacity of the iympho-hemopoietic tissue, it has been argued that a general
suppression of cell proliferation by TS cells would be much more efficient than
cytotoxicity to cause cellular depletion in that tissue (13). A general suppression of
cell proliferation should cause a depletion of most of the lympho-hemopoietic bone
marrow cells because they are short-lived, but not of the neighboring reticular
fibroblasts that are long-lived (40). This is precisely what we observed in the 2° F1
recipients of day-5 cells (Fig. 3 A). Although fibroblasts can be killed by alloreactive
TK cells in vitro (41), they were not visibly damaged or reduced in numbers by the
cytotoxic T cells present among day-5 and day-6 cells. In conclusion, both experimen-
tal evidence and theoretical reasoning indicate that donor TK cells alone are incapable
of inducing LGVHD. On the other hand, no donor-cell population that is devoid of
cytotoxic anti-F1 activity while maintaining the capacity for induction of LGVHD is
now available. Hence, on the basis of the available data, we cannot exclude a limited
participation of donor TK cells in the pathogenesis of LGVHD. A possible place of
TK cell activity was the small intestine, where lymphocytes invading the epithelium
were noticed. This, however, was found in the 2° F1 recipients of both day-5 and day-
6 cells. Hence, lymphocytic invasion of the intestinal epithelium cannot account, or
cannot account alone, for the sepsis and LGVHD exclusively induced by day-5 cells.
Possibly, in the GVHR, alloreactive TK cells of the donor are readily blocked by
the large excess of alloantigen-bearing cells of the recipient. Whatever the explanation,
we were impressed by the fact that in two other models of T cell reactivity in vivo,
ROLINK ET AL. 1519
too, no functional role of TK cells could be detected, although such cells were readily
demonstrable in vitro (42, 43). It appears that cytotoxicity is an exceptional T cell
function because it is performed by T cells themselves. Instead, the main function of
T lymphocytes as a class appears to be an indirect one in that T cell subsets act by
regulating, mainly through the release of factors, the function of other cells, such as
lymphocytes, macrophages, and the progenitors of erythrocytes, monocytes, and
myeloid ceils (10, 37, 38). The results of the present investigation fit into this general
concept. Conceivably, a better understanding of stimulatory GVH mechanisms that
cause the hypergammaglobulinemia and lymphadenopathy, on the one hand, and
the suppressive mechanisms that cause the hypogammaglobulinemia, aplastic anemia,
and pancytopenia of LGVHD, on the other hand, will eventually improve our
understanding of the same pathological conditions that develop after viral infections
or exposure to sensitizing drugs. There is reason to assume that GVH-like reactions to
"altered-self" structures on lympho-hemopoietic cells can underly all these conditions
(9).
Summary
Splenic T cells from B10 donors were injected into irradiated (B10 × DBA/2)F1
mice. Either 5 or 6 d later, activated donor T cells were recovered from the spleens of
these primary FI (1° Fa) recipients and transferred to groups of nonirradiated
syngeneic F1 (2° F:) recipients. Whereas day-5-activated parental T cells induced the
characteristic symptoms of acute graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) and eventually lethal
GVHD, day-6-activated B10 T cells failed to induce acute GVHD but induced
symptoms of chronic GVHD. Interestingly, the inability of day-6-activated T cells to
induce lethal GVHD could not be ascribed to a lack in anti-F1 T killer cells.
The combined results of functional studies indicated that day-6 cells were enriched
for alloreactive helper T cells, whereas day-5 cells were enriched for alloreactive
suppressor cells. Hence, our findings indicate that acute GVHD and lethal GVHD
are caused by alloreactive donor T suppressor but not T killer cells, and that symptoms
of chronic GVHD are caused by alloreactive donor T helper cells.
