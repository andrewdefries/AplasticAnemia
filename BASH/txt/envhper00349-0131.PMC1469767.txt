Chronic exposure of humans to benzene affects hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and leads
to aplastic anemia. The stromal macrophage, a target of benzene toxicity, secretes interleukin-1
(IL-1), which induces the stromal fibroblast to synthesize hematopoietic colony-stimulating
factors. In a mouse model, benzene causes an acute marrow hypocellularity that can be
prevented by the concomitant administration of IL-1 a. The ability of benzene to interfere with the
production and secretion of IL-la was tested. Stromal macrophages from benzene-treated mice
were capable of the transcription of the IL-la gene and the translation of the message but
showed an inability to process the 34-kDa pre-IL-1a precursor to the 17-kDa biologically active
cytokine. Treatment of normal murine stromal macrophages in culture with hydroquinone (HQ)
also showed an inhibition in processing of pre-IL-1 a. Hydroquinone is oxidized by a peroxidase-
mediated reaction in the stromal macrophage to p-benzoquinone, which interacts with the
sulfhydryl (SH) groups of proteins and was shown to completely inhibit the activity of calpain, the
SH-dependent protease that cleaves pre-IL-1 a. In a similar manner, HQ, via peroxidase oxidation
to p-benzoquinone, was capable of preventing the IL-1 ,B autocrine stimulation of growth of human
B1 myeloid tumor cells by preventing the processing of pre-IL-1f to mature cytokine.
Benzoquinone was also shown to completely inhibit the ability of the SH-dependent IL-1lB
converting enzyme. Thus benzene-induced bone marrow hypocellularity may result from
apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor cells brought about by lack of essential cytokines and
deficient IL-la production subsequent to the inhibition of calpain by p-benzoquinone and the
prevention of pre-IL-1 processing. Environ Health Perspect 104(Suppl 6):1251-1256 (1996)

sulfhydryl (SH) group of cysteine residues
in cellular proteins (8).
The S0 is involved in hematopoietic
regulation (9-11) through the synthesis of
several cytokines including interleukin-1
(IL-1), which synergizes with IL-3 to pro-
mote the development of the pluripotent
stem cell to myeloid and lymphoid stem
cells (12). IL-1 is also involved in lympho-
cyte development and in the induction of
cytokine production by stromal fibroblasts
(11,13,14). Inhibition ofthe production of
active IL-I in S0 could result in a lack of
cytokines, increased physiological cell death
(apoptosis) of hematopoietic progenitor
cells, and thus bone marrow cell depression.
BZ-induced bone marrow cell depression
might result from interference by BQ in IL-
1 production, processing, and/or secretion
in S0. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
secretion of IL-I by murine S0 (15) and
P388Dl macrophagelike cells (16) was
decreased in vitro after exposure to HQ
and a decrease in chymotrypsinlike activity
in extracts of P388D, cells was observed
concomitant with a decrease in the release of
IL-1 into the conditioned medium (16),
leading the authors (16) to suggest that
HQ decreased IL-I release by inhibiting
proteolytic conversion of the molecule
from its membrane-bound precursor form.
Two IL-1 cytokines, IL-la and IL-1[3,
are the products of distinct genes located
on chromosome 2 (17). The transcript of
each gene is translated as a precursor
protein of approximately 34 kDa that is
converted by a specific protease to a biolog-
ically active cytokine of 17 kDa (18). The
processing ofpre-IL-1 a to mature cytokine
is catalyzed by the SH-dependent protease,
calpain (19,20). The release of IL-i[, from
the cell is also associated with the cleavage
of its precursor form by a sulfhydryl (SH)-
dependent protease referred to as IL- 1
converting enzyme (ICE) (21-23).
We report here that HQ, via peroxi-
dation to BQ, has no effect on the tran-
scription or translation of mRNAs for the
34-kDa pre-IL-ia or pre-IL-1[3 but pre-
vents the proteolytic conversion ofthe pre-
IL-1 forms to the 17-kDa active cytokines
in murine S0 or human B1 myeloid cells,
respectively. In addition, S0 from BZ-
treated mice produce the 34-kDa pre-IL-
la when stimulated in culture with LPS
(24) but cannot convert the precursor to
IL-la. These results suggest that BQ also
prevents the conversion in vivo and thus
may be responsible for BZ-induced bone
marrow cell depression. In this connection,

BZ-induced bone marrow cell depression
can be prevented by the concomitant
administration with BZ of native but not
heat-inactivated, recombinant IL-ixa, thus
bypassing the inability of the HQ-inhib-
ited S0 to produce IL-la (24). We also
show that BQ is an excellent inhibitor of
the proteolytic activity ofcalpain and ICE.
Methods
Isolation of resident S0, preparation of an
adherent stromal layer from BZ-treated
animals, exposure to HQ, and determina-
tion of intracellular and membrane-bound
IL-la were carried out as previously
described (24). Treatment of mice with
BZ and the effect of IL-la on BZ-induced
bone marrow cell depression were previ-
ously described (25). The Bi cell line was
established from the bone marrow of a
patient with a relapse of acute lymphocytic
leukemia (ALL) characterized by a 4;1 1
chromosomal translocation, the expression
of the stem cell marker CD34, and an
immature pre-B/myeloid phenotype
(26,27). The cells secrete IL-1p, which
supports the autocrine growth of the cells
(27). The cells were seeded at a density of
5 x 105 in a minimal essential medium
(aMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and incubated at 37°C with
5% CO2. The cells were fed every 7 days
and diluted to the initial seeding density.
Cells growing at a density of 4 x 106/ml
secrete approximately 25 pg/ml IL-13 in
24 hr. Cells (4.5 x 106/ml) were exposed to
2 pM HQ at zero time and allowed to
incubate for 4 days. Cell viability after HQ
exposure was 95% as measured by Trypan
Blue exclusion. IL-,13 was added to the
HQ-treated cells 4 hr after the addition of
HQ. Control cultures received phosphate
buffered saline, the vehicle in which HQ
was dissolved. All treatments were carried
out in triplicate. At the end of 4 days, cells
from each treatment group were collected
by centrifugation and the culture medium
saved for determination of the presence of
IL- 1 by Western blot analysis.
Assay for BQ Inhibition ofCalpain
and ICE. Calpain, with a specific prote-
olytic activity against casein of 53 U/ml,
was purified from fresh-washed human
platelet concentrates (28) and was assayed
by measuring the hydrolysis of a specific
peptide substrate, 3-carboxypropionyl-leu-
tyr-NH-7-(4-methyl) coumarylamide,
which liberates a fluorescent product (29).
The dialyzed enzyme and buffer (or
inhibitor) were mixed and immediately
added to a rectangular quartz cuvette at
25°C containing 1 mM peptide substrate in
60 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 2.5%
(v/v) dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and 5
mM CaCl2. The rate of hydrolysis of pep-
tide was continuously recorded by a fluores-
cence spectrophotometer connected to a
chart recorder. The absorbance excitation
maximum of substrate occurred at 380 nm
(5-nm slit width) and emission response at
440 nm (10 nm slit width). Proteolytic
activity of recombinant ICE, in the pres-
ence or absence of BQ, was monitored by
Western immunoblot analysis of the prote-
olytic product, the mature 17- kDa IL-13,
using recombinant pre-IL-l as the sub-
strate and a monoclonal anti-IL-i1 anti-
body to identify the both the pre-IL-1lB and

(200 mM glycine, 3 mM SDS, 30 mM

electroblotted at 25 mAmp overnight onto

Results and Discussion
Ability ofRecombinant Murine IL-la
to Prevent Benzene-induced
Depression ofBone Marrow
Celiularity
If our premise is correct that BZ-induced
bone marrow cell depression in a mouse
model results from an inhibition of the
processing of pre-IL-1 a by calpain, then
BZ-induced bone marrow hypocellularity
should be prevented by the coadministra-
tion of IL-la with BZ. Figure 1 presents a
representative of five experiments, all of
which showed similar results. Seven groups

follows: One group was treated with vehi-
cle (corn oil) only and served as control.
One group received BZ (600 mg/kg body
weight, ip, twice/day for 2 days) and
another group received only recombinant
murine IL-1 (rMuIL-loa) (2000U/ml).
Three groups were given rMuIL-lc (500,
1000, or 2000 U/animal) 18 hr prior to the
first daily BZ injection. The remaining
group was administered heat-inactivated
rMuIL-la (2000 U/animal) prior to BZ
treatment. Administration of BZ to mice
decreased the nucleated cells in the bone
marrow (Figure 1) to 25% ofcontrol, mea-
sured 17 hr after the last BZ injection (on
day 3). Native rMuIL-la provided a dose-
dependent protection against the depres-
sive effects ofBZ (Figure 1, bars 3-5), with
complete protection occurring at 2000
U/animal (100 U/g bw). Heat-inactivated
rMuIL-lo did not protect (bar 6) and pre-
treatment with rMuIL-lac alone (bar 7)
did not affect bone marrow cellularity in
3 days. rMuIL-lcx provided similar protec-
tion when the dose ofBZ administered was
800 mg/kg bw. Taken together, these
results suggest that the depression of bone
marrow cellularity in mice may result from
an inability of the S0 to process pre-
IL-lac, the major form in the mouse, to
biologically active cytokine required for the
induction in stromal fibroblasts of colony-
stimulating factors essential for the survival
of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Addi-
tional support for this hypothesis is the
demonstration that BZ-induced myelotoxi-
city is completely prevented when exoge-
nous IL-loc obviates the lack of IL-lot in
the S0 ofBZ- or HQ-treated animals.
Inhibition of the Conversion of
Pre-IL-la to Mature Cytokine in SO
from Benzene-treated Mice and in S0
Treated with Hydroquinone in Culture.
The inhibition of conversion of precursor
to cytokine was demonstrated in S0 of
mice treated with BZ under conditions
that cause myelotoxicity measured as severe
depression of bone marrow cellularity.
Three groups (n= 4) of C57Bl/6J mice were
established. One group received the vehicle
only. The second was treated with 800
mg/kg BZ ip twice daily for 2 days.
Indomethacin (2 mg/kg), a prostaglandin H
synthase-peroxidase inhibitor was con-
comitantly administered to group three.
Indomethacin has been shown to prevent
BZ-induced bone marrow cell depression
and genotoxicity (30). It has no effect on
the hepatic metabolism ofBZ at this dosage
but does prevent oxidation of HQ to reac-
tive species in the S0. Eighteen hours after
the final BZ administration, femoral bone
marrow was obtained and the number of
nucleated marrow cells determined. Bone
marrow cellularity of BZ-treated mice was
depressed to 45% of control, while coad-
ministration of indomethacin prevented
depression (data not shown). The ability of
S0 from BZ-treated animals to convert 34-
kDa pre-IL-la to 17-kDa cytokine was
assessed by placing bone marrow cells from
the three experimental groups into culture
to establish an adherent layer consisting pre-
dominately of S0 and fibroblasts. IL-la
production by the S0 was stimulated by
incubation with LPS for 18 hr. Conversion
ofthe precursor to the 17-kDa cytokine was
analyzed in cell lysate protein by Western
immunoblotting. As can be seen in Figure
2, S0 from control animals stimulated with
LPS produced both a 34-kDa pre-IL-lx
and a 17-kDa mature cytokine (lane 2).
The precursor was produced in LPS-
treated S0 from animals administered BZ,
indicating that transcription and translation
were not affected, but the precursor was not
converted to the 17-kDa mature cytokine
(lane 1). Indomethacin administered con-

Indomethacin (2 mg/kg) was administered concomi-
tantly with BZ. Eighteen hours after the last BZ injec-
tion, the animals were killed and the femoral bone
marrow plug was extruded with RPMI 1640/10 mM
Hepes, pH 7.4/10 U heparin. Bone marrow cells were
incubated at 37°C, 5% C02 for 2 hr to yield an adher-
ent layer of S0. IL-lcr production was induced by incu-
bating the adherent layer in media containing 10% FBS
and 40 mg/ml LPS for 18 hr. The cells were washed,
lysed and the cell protein analyzed for the presence of
IL-1 a by Western immunoblotting. Separation of lysate
protein was performed using SDS-PAGE (15%, 0.8 mm
thick, 14x 14, 150 V). Equal amounts of protein were
added to each well. The proteins were electroblotted
to nitrocellulose and the blot probed with specific poly-
clonal rabbit anti-MulL-la antibody followed by

comitantly with BZ prevented the inhibi-
tion of precursor processing (lane 3) that
results from the oxidation of HQ to BQ
by peroxidase.
The inhibition of conversion of pre-
IL-i ac to cytokine by HQ in normal mouse
S0 was demonstrated by culturing femoral
bone marrow cells with recombinant
macrophage colony-stimulating factor for 7
days, which resulted in a population of
greater than 95% S0, as determined by
morphological and biochemical analysis
(data not shown). Confluent S0 were
treated with HQ (0.5-10.0 pM) for 6 hr,
followed by stimulation with LPS for 24
hr. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysate pro-
tein indicated that S0 did not express
IL-la in the absence of LPS stimulation
(Figure 3, lane 1), whereas in the presence
of LPS, precursor was produced and
converted to mature cytokine (lane 2).
Exposure to HQ did not affect transcrip-
tion or translation of pre-IL-ia at 10 1iM,
but 0.5 pM HQ completely inhibited the
conversion of pre-IL-la to cytokine
(Figure 3, lanes 3-6). Thus, S0 from BZ-
treated mice and from those treated in cul-
ture with HQ are incapable of producing
active cytokine, most probably because BQ
has inhibited the protease responsible for
cleaving the 34-kDa precursor to the
17-kDa active molecule. HQ has been
reported to both inhibit calpain II activity
and selectively decrease calpain II content
in mouse bone marrow S0 as measured by
immunoblot analysis (31); the inhibition
and decrease in calpain activity may occur
because of an increased turnover of the
inactive, damaged BQ-adducted calpain.

Inhibition ofCalpain,
the Pre-IL-la Processing
Enzyme, byp-Benzoquinone
Processing of the membrane-associated
34-kDa pre-IL- ax to the 17-kDa biologi-
cally active cytokine is catalyzed by the
membrane-bound SH-dependent protease,
calpain (19,20). BQ, produced from HQ in
the cytosol of the S0, may inactivate cal-
pain by forming a covalent adduct with the
SH group of an essential cysteine residue at
the active site (32). We have demonstrated
previously that macrophages oxidize radio-
labeled HQ to BQ, which covalently binds
to proteins (8), and in the presence of
excess cysteine to compete with protein SH
groups, BQ is trapped as the BQ-S-cysteine
monoadduct (8). As can be seen in Figure
4, BQ causes a concentration-dependent
inhibition ofthe activity ofpurified human
platelet calpain with a 50% inhibitory
concentration of 3 pM, making BQ one of
the most potent inhibitors of this protease.
For these reasons we postulate that BQ
inhibits calpain by covalently binding to
the essential SH group of cysteine 108 at
the active site (32).
HQlnhibition ofPre-IL-1[B
Conversion to Mature Secreted IL-1
In the human cell, IL-1[3 represents the major
isoform. IL-i [3 undergoes slow release from
the cell associated with cleavage of pre-IL-1I3
by the cysteine protease, ICE. To determine
the effects of HQ on the processing of
pre-IL-1[ , we turned to the BI cell line as a
model. This cell line exhibits density-depen-
dent growth and secretes an autostimulatory
growth factor that has been identified as

IL-1[B. BI cells constitutively express mRNA
for pre-IL-1[P and the IL-I receptor and
secrete the active cytokine. An inhibition of
ICE by treatment of the cells with HQ
should prevent conversion of pre-IL-1,[,
secretion ofIL-i[ into the growth medium,
and autocrine stimulation of the cells. As
can be seen from a representative (Figure 5)
ofthree experiments, all ofwhich gave virtu-
ally identical results, untreated Bi cells
increase approximately 7-fold over the 5-day
test period due to autocrine stimulation by
IL-1i . HQ (2 pM) significantly inhibited
the proliferation of Bi cells at day 4
(p<0.001) (Figure 5), presumably because
the BQ-inactivated ICE is incapable ofcon-
verting pre-IL-1[ to secretable, biologically
active cytokine. The failure of HQ-treated
cells to increase in number because ofloss of
autocrine stimulation by IL-1[ is supported
by the fact that the growth curve of HQ-
treated cells supplemented with recombi-
nant human interleukin-l1[ (rHuIL-1[,),
approached that ofcontrol cells. The lack of
IL-i [ secretion by the HQ-treated cells was
confirmed by the failure to demonstrate the
presence of the 17-kDa IL-i,[3 in the condi-
tioned medium on day 4 by Western
immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-IL-1[P

antibody (Figure 6, lane 3). A distinct band
indicative of a protein of 17 kDa, which
migrated to the same position as the IL-i [3
standard (lane 1), was observed in the culture
media of control cells (Figure 6, lane 2) and
cells treated with HQ+IL-I[ (lane 4).
However, in the presence of HQ, there was
no observable band at 17 kDa (lane 3) indica-
tive of the inability of HQ-treated cells to
convert pre-IL-1[ to the secretable cytokine.
Taken together, these results indicate
that B1 cells, whose proliferation in culture
is dependent on the autocrine secretion of
IL-i [3, are prevented by HQ from process-
ing pre-IL-1O to active secreted cytokine
and thus from autocrine growth.
Effect ofIndomethacin on theAbility
ofHydroquinone to Inhibit Growth
ofBI Cells and Pre-IL-13 Processing
To demonstrate that a peroxidase-mediated
conversion of HQ to BQ is required for
inhibition of ICE and the subsequent lack
of conversion of pre-IL-1[ to mature cyto-
kine, B1 cells were treated with HQ as in
Figure 5 in the presence or absence of indo-
methacin, a peroxidase inhibitor. The pres-
ence of20 pM indomethacin concomitantly
with HQ significantly prevented HQ from
inhibiting ICE (Figure 7, bar graph), and
thus from reducing the cell number at day

Figure 7. Western immunoblot analysis of the effect
of indomethacin on the ability of hydroquinone to
inhibit the growth of B1 cells and pre-lL-1 3 process-
ing. A culture of B1 cells was divided into four treat-
ment groups, each set up in triplicate; untreated,
treated with a final concentration of 2 pM HQ; treated
with 2 pM HQ and 20 pM indomethacin; treated with
20 pM indomethacin only. The cells were cultured for
4 days; cell counts and viability studies were per-
formed. Viability was always greater than 95% after
treatment. Data points (cell growth) represent the
mean number of cells of three replicates + SD. HQ-
treated cells were significantly different from the con-
trol cells and the indomethacin-treated cells at
p<0.005. Insert: lysate was prepared by subjecting
cells (2x 106) to three freeze-thaw cycles, the debris
was removed by centrifugation, and the sample pre-
pared for PAGE and Western immunoblotting as
described in the legend for Figure 3. Lysates (2 pg
total protein/well) and conditioned media ([CM]; 2 pg
total protein/well) were prepared and subjected to
PAGE and Western immunoblotting.The experiment
presented is representative of three experiments that
gave virtually identical results. Insert: lysate; lane 1,
pre-IL-1 ,B marker; lane 2, control; lane 3, HQ + indo-
methacin; lane 4, HQ; lane 5, control + indomethacin;
CM, lane 1, pre-IL-1 ,B marker; lane 2, HQ + indometha-
cin; lane 3, control+ indomethacin; lane 4, HQ; lane 5,
control; lane 6, IL-1 ,B marker.
4. This result suggests that the peroxidase-
mediated oxidation ofHQ to BQ, the more
active compound, is occurring in B1 cells.
Indomethacin, which by itself showed some
effect on cell growth, restored the cell num-
ber in the presence of HQ to the number
seen with indomethacin alone. In addition,
it can be seen from a Western blot analysis of
pre-IL-1O in the cell lysate (Figure 7, insert)
and mature IL-11 in the conditioned
medium that neither HQ nor indometha-
cin have an effect on the transcription or
translation of the 31-kDa pre-IL-1 (cell
lysate) but that HQ does inibit the forma-
tion of the mature 17-kDa IL-153 and
thereby its secretion into the conditioned
medium, and this inhibition is prevented
by indomethacin.
Inhibition ofIL-1[3 Converting
Enzyme by BQ
The ability of BQ to inactivate ICE was
assayed by monitoring the conversion of
the 31-kDa recombinant pre-IL-I to the
17 kDa IL-15 by BQ-treated recombinant
ICE using Western immunoblot analysis
and a specific IL-1i monoclonal antibody
(Figure 8). Pretreatment ofICE for 10 min
with 3 pM BQ prior to incubation with
the precursor resulted in complete inhibi-
tion of the conversion of pre-IL-1,B to the
mature 17-kDa cytokine (Figure 8, lane 3
compared with lane 2). This experiment was
repeated three times. Treatment of pre-
IL-1 , or IL-13 with BQ does not affect
mobility of the cytokine in the gel, its reac-
tion with antibody, or its use as a substrate
for ICE (data not presented). The inhibition
of ICE protease activity by BQ was similar
to the inhibition by iodoacetic acid, which is
known to alkylate free SH groups and to
inhibit ICE (data not presented).
In summary, BZ induces a severe bone
marrow cell depression in mice that can be
prevented by IL-la. Marrow S0 from BZ-
treated mice can affect the transcription and
translation of the 34-kDa pre-IL-la but
4514.

Figure 8. Western immunoblot analysis of the inhibi-
tion of pre-lL-1 P conversion by treatment of ICE with
BQ. The 31-kDa recombinant pre-IL-13 (20 ng) was
incubated with ICE (0.6 ng ) at 37°C in the presence or
absence of 3 pM BQ in 10 mM Tris/HCI, pH 8.1, in a
total volume of 10 pl for 3 hr at 37°C. BQ was preincu-
bated with ICE for 10 min before starting the reaction.
Pre-lL-1 P and IL-1 , markers were added at 20 ng. The
reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of
SDS sample solvent and the samples boiled for 5 min.
The conversion of pre-IL-1 3 to the mature form was
analyzed by PAGE and Western immunoblotting. Lane
1, pre-IL-1 ,B; lane 2, pre-IL-1 + ICE; lane 3, pre-IL-11 +
BQ-treated ICE; lane 4, IL-15 marker. The experiment
was done three times with identical results.
cannot proteolytically cleave the pre-cursor
to the mature, biologically active cytokine.
Murine S0 treated with as little as 5 x 10-7
M HQ cannot process pre-IL-ax because of
the peroxidase-mediated oxidation of HQ
to BQ that inhibits the SH-dependent pro-
tease, calpain. HQ, by oxidation to BQ in
the human myeloid-type BI cell, also inacti-
vates ICE, the SH-dependent protease
responsible for converting pre-interleukin-
1 3 to biologically active cytokine, which
results in the inhibition of IL-15-dependent
autocrine growth of B1 cells. The results
indicate that BZ-induced bone marrow
hypocellularity in the mouse results from
apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor cells
brought about by a lack ofessential cytokines
subsequent to S0 dysfunction and deficient
IL-1 production caused by BQ inactivation
of the protease responsible for processing
pre-IL-1l. In view of the ability of BZ to
cause aplastic anemia, it is of interest that in
two large studies of aplastic anemia, a high
percentage of patients showed stromal S0
dysfunction and deficient IL-1 production in
comparison with controls (33,34).
