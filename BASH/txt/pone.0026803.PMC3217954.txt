Abstract
Amongst all leukemias, Bcr-Abl positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) confers resistance to native drug due to multi
drug resistance and also resistance to p53 and fas ligand pathways. In the present study, we have investigated the efficacy
of microtubule stabilizing paclitaxel loaded magnetic nanoparticles (pac-MNPs) to ascertain its cytotoxic effect on Bcr-Abl
positive K562 cells. For active targeted therapy, pac-MNPs were functionalized with lectin glycoprotein which resulted in
higher cellular uptake and lower IC50 value suggesting the efficacy of targeted delivery of paclitaxel. Both pac-MNPs and
lectin conjugated pac-MNPs have a prolonged circulation time in serum suggesting increased bioavailability and
therapeutics index of paclitaxel in vivo. Further, the molecular mechanism pertaining to pac-induced cytotoxicity was
analyzed by studying the involvement of different apoptotic pathway proteins by immunoblotting and quantitative PCR.
Our study revealed simultaneous activation of JNK pathway leading to Bcr-Abl instability and the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway after pac-MNPs treatment in two Bcr-Abl positive cell lines. In addition, the MRI data suggested the potential
application of MNPs as imaging agent. Thus our in vitro and in vivo results strongly suggested the pac-MNPs as a future
prospective theranostic tool for leukemia therapy.

Introduction
Amongst the different types of leukemias, chronic myelogenous
leukemia (CML) is a clonal malignancy of the hematopoietic stem
cells that arises from a 9; 22 chromosomal translocation which
fuses the ABL proto-oncogene to the BCR gene encoding
the fusion protein p210Bcr-Abl
[1,2]. The abnormal p210Bcr-Abl
constitutively activates tyrosine kinase activity and promotes
leukemogenesis by inducing the phosphorylation of multiple
downstream protein targets that mediate multiple growth
promoting and anti-apoptotic signals. In mammalian cells, the
distinct MAPK members are the important signaling molecules in
the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. These include
extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), pAkt, stress-activat-
ed protein kinases (SAPKs)/c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and
the p38 MAPK. The ERK cascade is mainly activated by growth
factors and is critical for proliferation and survival. Whereas, JNK
and p38 are only weakly activated by growth factors, but are
highly activated in response to a variety of stress signals including
tumor necrosis factor and their activation is most frequently
associated with induction of apoptosis [3]. In CML the Bcr-Abl
gene enhances the cell proliferation by activating the ERK and
pAkt pathways and by inhibiting the p38 and JNK pathways [1].
Chemotherapy is the main strategy to treat leukemia because
unlike solid tumor, hematological malignant tumor cannot be
cured by surgical treatment or radiation therapy. However, the
major obstacle associated in chemotherapy is the resistance of
leukemic cells to various chemotherapeutic agents. This is because
most of the anti-cancer drugs induce apoptosis by initiating the
intrinsic mitochondrial, or cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9 path-
way. The apoptotic pathways in chronic myeloid leukemia are
mainly blocked due to Bcr-Abl gene expression, p53 mutation and
deficiency of Fas receptor and functional Apaf-1 [4]. To reverse
the resistance mechanism with simultaneously reducing the side
effects during high dose chemotherapy, a promising approach is
rendered through which the conventional chemotherapy could be
combined with new strategies leading for the induction of
apoptosis to leukemia cells.
Paclitaxel is a potent antineoplastic agent against a wide variety
of malignancies. It has been approved by the FDA for the
treatment of breast cancer, ovarian cancer and non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) [5]. At the cellular level, Paclitaxel mainly binds
to the beta-tubulin subunits in microtubules and promotes
polymerization of tubulin and disrupts microtubule dynamics,
leading to a sustained mitotic arrest and ultimately to apoptotic
cell death [6]. However, molecular pathways involved in the
apoptotic process induced by this agent are still not known.
Antimicrotubule agents are known to induce phosphorylation and
thus inactivation of the antiapoptotic members of the Bcl family
such as Bcl-2 [7,8]. The efficacy of taxanes on human leukemic
cell lines [9,10] as well as their effectiveness in inducing apoptosis
in vivo [11] and in fresh leukemia cells in primary cultures [12]
have been investigated. Al Alami et al. have demonstrated the
dose-dependency and time-dependency of the anti-tumor effects of
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 11 | e26803
paclitaxel in leukemia [9]. Anti-leukemic activity of taxanes was
studied in samples with chromosomal abnormalities associated
with an unfavorable outcome, such as the Bcr-Abl translocation
(Philadelphia chromosome) [13].
The key problem associated with hematological malignancy is
reduced sensitivity of tumor cells to cytotoxic drugs and the drug
efflux pumps that gives rise to multi drug resistance (MDR).
Nanomaterials are well known to have potential applications in
disease diagnosis and therapeutics [14]. The application of the
magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in the field of biomedical
application such as magnetic drug delivery, magnetic resonance
imaging, transfection, cell and tissue targeting, has pooled
considerable attention due to their intrinsic magnetic properties
[15,16,17]. The MNPs mediated chemotherapeutics have revealed
significant synergistic effect on the apoptosis of leukemic cells
[18,19,20]. Chen et al. have studied the synergistic effect of
gambosic acid and daunomycin on the drug accumulation and
apoptosis of leukemia cells intervened by iron oxide (Fe3O4)
nanoparticles [21]. In another study, Lv et al. have demonstrated
the efficacy of the Fe3O4-polylactic acid (PLA) nanocomposites for
increased local drug concentration at the drug-sensitive leukemia
K562 cells leading to induction of cell death [22].
To utilize the MNPs as a drug delivery vehicle, it is essential to
be coated with hydrophilic or hydrophobic polymer to avoid the
aggregation in vivo. Further, these MNPs should also acquire high
drug loading capacity, desired release profile, aqueous dispersi-
bility, biocompatibility with cells and tissues along with retention
of magnetic properties [23]. Our previous study have demonstrat-
ed that coating the MNPs with long chain amphiphilic lipid
polymer glyceryl monooleate (GMO) provides the aqueous
dispersibility and permits the incorporation of both hydrophilic
and hydrophobic drugs [15,24]. In different experimental setups,
our group has already established the fact that, targeted drug
delivery through functionalized drug carriers is an effective
strategy to provide higher therapeutic concentrations of anticancer
drugs by overcoming the multidrug resistance at the targeted
cancer cells thereby reducing the dose and unaffecting the
noncancerous tissues [25,26,27]. Apart from the therapeutic
application, currently significant attention has been laid down
for the multifunctional characteristics and complementary role of
MNPs as a contrast agent for the magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) [24,28,29]. MRI provides excellent differential soft tissue
contrast that helps to discriminate healthy tissues and abnormal
tissues like cancer tissues. Thus, magnetic nanoparticles provide an
excellent diagnosis tool for the treatment of cancer. In addition, in
case of leukemia, T2 weighted MRI has already been established
as an efficient diagnostic and management tool [30,31]. Jaetao et
al. have demonstrated that detection of leukemic cells can be
enhanced by using MNPs with surface conjugation of receptor-
specific ligands [32].
So, here in this study, we have investigated the efficacy of
paclitaxel loaded MNPs (pac-MNPs) formulations functionalized
with a targeting moiety lectin. The use of specific molecular
signatures at the targeted site helps in delivering the appropriate
therapeutic concentration aiding the advantage of receptor
mediated endocytosis. The cellular uptake efficiency of pac-MNPs
and lectin conjugated pac-MNPs (lec-pac-MNPs) was compared
with native drug in leukemic cell line (K562). The uptake
experiment was also studied in lectin negative cell line i.e,
HEK293. To elucidae the probable molecular pathways ascribed
through pac-MNPs in K562 cells, the levels of different extrinsic
and intrinsic apoptotic pathway proteins were studied through
immunobloting. Besides the levels of expression of different
apoptotic genes and CML specific Bcr-Abl gene were quantified
through real time PCR following post treatment of native pac,
pac-MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs. To validate the outcome, the gene
expression of apoptotic pathway proteins and Bcr-Abl were
studied in another Bcr-Abl positive cell line i.e, Kcl22 and Bcr-
Abl negative cell line i.e, Jurkat.
Results
Physicochemical characterization of Pac-MNPs
The synthesis and the physicochemical characterizations of our
formulated magnetic nanoparticles were well studied and already
described and reported by our group [15]. The internal diameter of
the MNPs measured by TEM was ,7 nm (Figure 1 A). However,
the pac-MNPs illustrated hydrodynamic diameter ,200 nm as
measured by the Zetasizer (Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern Instru-
ments, Malvern, UK). The AFM microscopy revealed the spherical
topology of the nanoparticles (Figure 1 B). The AFM observation
also substantiates the hydrodynamic size of the particles. The
difference in hydrodynamic and TEM size is may be due to the fact
that it provides information of the hydrodynamic layers formed due
to the coatings around the cluster of pac-MNPs [15]. The pac-
MNPs have high negative zeta potential ,223 mV as measured by
dynamic laser light scattering [15].
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) provides the informa-
tion about possible chemical interaction and the physical state of
drug inside the nanoparticles [33]. As per the DSC results, the
native pac showed an endothermic peak at 215uC (Figure 1C-i). At
this range, no peak was observed in case of void MNPs (Figure 1C-
ii), moreover there was absence of endothermic peak for pac in
pac-MNPs (Figure 1C-iii). The absence of specific peaks for the
crystalline domain of native pac suggested that the drug present
inside the MNPs formulation is in amorphous or disordered-
crystaline state [34]. The in vitro release kinetics profile showed
release of 7364% pac from pac-MNPs and 6962.1% from the
lec-pac-MNPs for a period of 20 days (Figure 1 D). The results
showed initial burst release followed by slow and sustained release
[15].
In vitro Imaging
To evaluate the usefulness of the drug loaded MNPs as a
contrast agent, the imaging characteristics of pac-MNPs were
evaluated in a phantom gel. The transverse relaxation time T2 was
observed to be reduced as the concentration of the pac-MNPs
(measured in mg Fe/ml) were increased in the phantom gels
compared to the control gel (Figure 2 A). In addition, with increase
in particle concentration of MNPs the reduction of T2 was more
significant; this was evident from the decreased signal intensity
(Figure 2 B). This reduction in T2 relaxation value suggests the
pac-MNPs to be a good candidate for imaging in MRI [24]. In
addition, to prove whether after uptake of the MNPs the leukemia
cells can be detected by the MRI, T2 relaxation of pac-MNPs and
lec-pac-MNPs treated K562 cells was measured. The T2
relaxation was observed to be reduced as the cell number was
increased from 0.1 lakh to 10 lakh (Figure 2 C). The reduction of
T2 relaxation can be observed from the signal intensity curve of
the different concentration of pac-MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs
treated K562 cell number (Figure 2 D). While comparing the
pac-MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs treated K562 cells it can be
observed that in case of lec-pac-MNPs treated K562 cells, there
is higher reduction in the signal intensity (Figure 2 D).

glycoproteins expressed in myeloid cells derived from peripheral

drug, MNPs and lectin conjugated MNPs, 6-coumarin was taken
as a probe and FACS analysis was performed. The mean
fluorescence intensity results showed that the cellular uptake of
lec-6-coumarin-MNPs was ,4 times higher than the native 6-

(Figure 3 A). To supplement the fact that uptake of lectin
conjugated MNPs is through receptor mediated endocytosis, we
have done a competitive inhibition assay. The results showed that
addition of 0.5 mg native lectin to the above formulation reduced
the uptake of lec-6-coumarin-MNPs by ,1.5 fold and a gradual
decrease was observed with increasing concentration of lectin
(Figure 3 B). Further, we have checked the uptake efficiency in
another Bcr-Abl positive cell line Kcl22 (Figure 3 C) and a Bcr-Abl
negative cell line Jurkat (Figure 3 D) and both of them do not show
overexpression of lectin receptors.
In both the cell lines, there was a significant higher uptake of 6-
coumarin-MNPs than the native one (,4 times in case of Kcl22
and ,5 times in case of Jurkat) whereas, the difference in the
uptake of 6-couma-MNPs and lec-6-coumarin-MNPs was mini-
mal. The enhanced uptake due to the lectin receptor was further
authenticated taking a lectin negative cell line i.e, HEK293. The
uptake analysis revealed that the MNPs showed an enhancement
in uptake by ,5 times but the uptake in case of lec-MNPs was
similar to that of MNPs.
In vivo Pharmacokinetics
In vivo pharmacokinetics was performed to compare the
bioavailability of paclitaxel in the blood serum of rats after
intravenous injection of native pac, pac-MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs
at different time periods up to 48 h. Figure 4 shows that the
highest concentration of paclitaxel in case of native pac, pac-
MNPs as well as lec-pac-MNPs can be observed after 30 minutes
of injection. After 24 h of treatment, the difference in the
paclitaxel concentration in serum between native pac and both
the formulations is very high. In addition, after 48 h, in case of
native pac treated rats, the blood serum shows un-detectable
concentration of paclitaxel whereas, in case of pac-MNPs and lec-
pac-MNPs treated rats, the concentration of paclitaxel in serum
was 11 mg/ml and 13 mg/ml respectively. The pharmacokinetics
analysis suggests that, in case of native pac, the T1/2 is achieved at
only 5 h. (Table 1). But, in case of pac-MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs
the T1/2 is reached after 15 h. The Cmax for native pac is 22.4 mg/
ml whereas for pac-MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs it is 34.2 mg/ml and
35 mg/ml respectively (Table 1). These data suggests the longer
blood circulation half-life of pac-MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs.
Cytotoxicity effect of different formulation on K562 cells
We have tested the cytotoxicity of void MNPs and confirmed
these to be nontoxic [15]. The therapeutic efficacies of paclitaxel
at concentrations of different native pac, pac-MNPs and lec-pac-
MNPs in K562, Kcl22 and Jurkat cells were investigated by
mitogenic assay. The results showed a typical dose dependent
sigmoidal antiproliferative effect of drug and drug loaded different
formulations. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
values, calculated from the obtained sigmoidal curves, demon-
strated that the lec-pac-MNPs showed higher antiproliferative
activity than un-conjugated pac-MNPs and the native pac in K562
cells (Figure 5 A).
After 48 h of treatment, the lec-pac-MNPs are ,67 times more
effective than native pac and ,10 times more effective than the
pac-MNPs in K562 cell line (Table 2). Similarly, in case of another
Bcr-Abl positive cell line Kcl22 and the Bcr-Abl negative Jurkat
cells, native pac, pac-MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs induced cytotox-
icity after 48 h of treatment. But, as the above two cell lines do not
overexpress the lectin receptors, there was minimal difference
between the IC50 values of pac-MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs. The
pac-MNPs were 5.7 and lec-pac-MNPs were 6.9 times more
effective than the native pac in Kcl22 cells (Figure 5 B, Table 2). In
Bcr-Abl negative cell line Jurkat also, cytotoxicity effect of native
pac, pac-MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs can be observed after 48 h.
(pac-MNPs were 7.3 and lec-pac-MNPs were 7.8 times more
effective than the native pac) as shown in Figure 5 C, Table 2.

Lectin conjugation enhances G2-M Arrest
Paclitaxel induces G2-M arrest due to its stabilizing effects on
microtubules. FACS analysis demonstrated that paclitaxel strongly
arrest K562 cells in G2-M phase (Figure 6) and a greater
proportion of cells in G2-M phase was observed in cells treated
with lec-pac-MNPs as compared to pac-MNPs. At the concentra-
tion 0.1 ng/ml, native pac showed only 33.6% in G2-M phase but,
both the nano formulations (unconjugated and conjugated)
showed ,38% cells in G2-M phase arrest. As evident from the
figure, with increasing concentration of drug, the arrest of cells at
G2-M phase increased. At the concentration 10 ng/ml the native
pac and pac-MNPs showed 40% and 46% cells in G2-M phase
arrest, whereas, lec-pac-MNPs showed the highest 70.6% cells in
G2-M phase arrest. As compared to other formulations, lec-pac-
MNPs at concentration of 10 ng/ml exhibited significant G2-M
phase arrest.
Lectin conjugated pac-MNPs induces more apoptosis
The induction of apoptosis in K562 cells by native pac, pac-
MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs was studied by structural analysis
through confocal microscopy and quantitatively through FACS
analysis. The cellular structural integrity study by confocal
microscopy revealed gradual nuclear condensation in early stages
which later on led to nuclear fragmentation (Figure 7 A). In case of
the targeted nanoparticles, maximum nuclear fragmentation was

observed even at 24 h of treatment as the blebbing of the nucleus
was clearly visible (Figure 7 A). The use of Annexin V FITC and
propidium iodide staining used for differentiation of apoptotic cells
in different stages suggest that after treating K562 cells with
10 ng/ml of drug, in 24 h, the lec-pac-MNPs showed ,40%
apoptotic population which increased to ,51% in 48 h whereas
the pac-MNPs and native pac showed ,22% and ,13%
respectively which increased to 30% and ,18% after 48 h
(Figure 7 B). After confirming the lec-pac-MNPs to be the better
formulation to induce apoptosis in K562 cells, we studied the
detailed molecular mechanism through which the drug induced
apoptosis by immunoblotting and real time PCR.
Immunoblotting experiment showing activation different
molecular pathways
K562 cells have been reported to resist the TNF-a induced
extrinsic apoptotic pathway [4]. Pac formulations are not sensitive
towards Fas-L mediated cell death as the level of Fas-L in treated
cells was similar to that of untreated cells even after 48 h of
treatment (Figure 8 A). However, pac-MNPs induced time
dependent cleavage of extrinsic pathway protein caspase 8 and
the cleavage was more significant in case of lec-pac-MNPs
(Figure 8 A). These results provided the proof that activation of
extrinsic apoptotic pathway is in a Fas-L independent manner and
might be TRAIL (TNF related apoptosis inducing ligand)
dependent. Further, caspase 8 induced the cleavage of proapototic
signaling protein Bid. A noticeable decrease in the level of full
length Bid and increase in the level of truncated Bid (t-Bid) was
observed, which was maximum for lec-pac-MNPs after 48 h of
treatment (Figure 8 A). The protein t-Bid facilitate the insertion of
Bax into mitochondrial membrane and links with the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway. The increased level of Bax protein could be
observed from the western blotting result (Figure 8 a).
Another crucial factor in K562 cells is Bcr-Abl which is a
constitutively active protein tyrosine kinase, promotes growth
factor independent cell proliferation by activating PI3K/AKT,
Stat 5 and Ras/ MEK/ Erk pathways and upregulating the
antiapoptotic proteins [1]. It was observed that after 48 h of
treatment with pac formulations, the level of Bcr-Abl protein
decreased significantly. The decrease was more significant in case
of lec-pac-MNPs as compared to pac-MNPs (Figure 8 B). Further,
we have studied the possible mechanism behind down regulation
of Bcr-Abl gene. Paclitaxel is known to cause apoptosis through

activation of stress signaling pathways like p38MAPK and JNK
pathways [37]. It was observed that even after 24 h of treatment,
the level of p38MAPK increased and the significant higher level
was observed after 48 h (Figure 8 B).
Further, activation of JNK pathway became apparent from the
results showing increased level of phosphorylated c-Jun and
decreased level of c-Jun after drug treatment (Figure 8 B).
Activation of JNK can cause instability of Bcr-Abl complex [38].
Induction of stress signaling pathways along with downregulation
of Bcr-Abl complex induces programmed cell death through
induction of proapototic signal proteins like Bad and p21 [39,40].
It was apparent from the results that, there was an increased level
of Bad and p21 (Figure 8 B) in a p53 independent manner, as p53
is in a mutated state in K562. Also, there was decreased level of
antiapoptotic signal proteins like Bcl-2 (Figure 8 C). With down
regulation of Bcl-2, the proapoptotic proteins Bad and Bax caused
permiabilization of the mitochondrial membrane potential leading
to release of cytochrome c. With the release of cytochrome c from
mitochondria, the caspase cascade gets activated, which was
evident from the immunoblot and the quantitative PCR results.
The released cytochrome c stimulated cleavage of caspase 9 which
was more significant after 48 h of treatment and was maximum in
case of the lec-pac-MNPs (Figure 8 C). The caspase 9 from
intrinsic pathway and the caspase 8 from extrinsic pathway
directed the cleavage of caspase 3 and finally lead to apoptosis.
This was evident from the decreased level of uncleaved caspase 3
and increased level of cleaved caspase 3 (Figure 8 C).
Mitochondrial membrane depolarization confirming
initiation of intrinsic pathway of apoptosis
Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential is one of the key
features revealing the initiation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway
which can be studied using JC-1 dye [41]. The FACS analysis in
treated K562 cells suggested a time dependent loss of membrane
potential which was highest in case of lec-pac-MNPs that might be
due to the higher uptake of lec-pac-MNPs. After 24 h of
treatment, the native pac and pac- MNPs showed only ,21.5
and 31.77% apoptotic population which increased to 30.67 and
40.43% respectively after 48 h of treatment (Figure 9). Similarly,
the lec-pac-MNPs showed only ,33.24% apoptotic population
after 24 h of treatment which increased to 52.25% after 48 h
(Figure 9).
Quantitative gene expression study of apoptotic
pathway by real time PCR
To study the expression of the apoptotic pathway factors at the
mRNA level and to deduce the fold increase or decrease in the
expression, quantitative PCR was done. For the extrinsic pathway
factors, in case of caspase 8, the lec-pac-MNPs showed 38 fold
increase in the expression of cleaved caspase 8 whereas the the
pac-MNPs showed 7 fold and the native pac showed only 5 fold
increase in the expression (Figure 10 A i, ii). Similarly, the lec-pac-
MNPs showed 12 fold increase in the expression of t-Bid whereas
native pac and pac-MNPs showed 3 and 4 fold increase
respectively than control t-Bid (Figure 10 A i, ii). Likewise, in

case of Bax, the lec-pac-MNPs showed 5 fold higher increase in
the expression (Figure 10 A i, ii). For the CML specific Bcr-Abl
gene, the quantitative PCR results showed that the fold decrease in
the expression in case of lec-pac-MNPs and pac-MNPs treated
cells were 29 and 17 fold respectively whereas that of native pac
was 2.4 fold compared to untreated cells (Figure 10 B i, ii). Also,
there was decreased level of antiapoptotic signal proteins like Bcl-2
(Figure 10 B i, ii) and the decrease was most significant in case of
lec-pac-MNPs i.e, 42.4 fold (Figure 10 B i, ii). Finally, the
quantitative PCR, revealed 16 fold increase in the level of cleaved
caspase 3 in case of lec-pac-MNPs and 8 and 1.3 folds increase
respectively in case of pac-MNPs and native pac as compared to
control cells (Figure 10 B i, ii).
To supplement the molecular pathway of apoptosis revealed in
K562 cells, gene expression of some key factors were studied in
another Bcr-Abl positive cell line Kcl22 and Bcr-Abl negative
Jurkat cells. In Kcl22, after 48 h of treatment, the down regulation
of Bcr-Abl gene was observed (Figure 10 C i, ii). The fold decrease
in the expression of Bcr-Abl gene was 1.4 fold in case of native Pac
and 12.5 fold in case of pac-MNP. For the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway factor, caspase 8, the increase in the expression was
observed in both Kcl22 and Jurkat cell lines. The native Pac
showed 3.7 fold and 5.7 fold increase in the level of cleaved
caspase 8 in case of Kcl22 and Jurkat respectively whereas the Pac-
MNPs sowed 9.1 fold and 13.1 fold increase respectively as
compared to the control cells (Figure 10 C, D). Finally, increase in
the expression of apoptotic factor caspase 3 was observed in both
Kcl22 and Jurkat cell line. The native Pac showed 1.3 fold and 3.3
fold increase in the level of cleaved caspase 8 in case of Kcl22 and
Jurkat respectively whereas the Pac-MNPs sowed 2.9 fold and 5.9
fold increase respectively as compared to the untreated control
cells (Figure 10 C, D). In both Kcl22 and Jurkat cells, the level of
expression of different genes in case of pac-MNPs treatment and
lec-pac-MNPs treatment was similar.
The above results from western blotting and real time PCR
suggest that the lec-pac-MNPs after entering into the leukemic
cells by receptor mediated endocytosis, can exert apoptotic effect
by both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. The extrinsic
pathway induces cleavage of caspase 8 which is further linked to
the either mitochondrial pathway or directly to the caspase 3
cleavage (Figure 11). The intrinsic pathway may regulate the
MAPKinase pathway which further joins the mitochondrial
paoptotic pathway by p21. In case of leukemia, paclitaxel may
help in Bcr-Abl gene instability by enhancing the Jun Kinase
which may have led to 14-3-3 protein phosphorylation which
remains linked to Bcr-Abl (Figure 11).
Discussion
At present most of the therapeutic modes for CML, includes
chemotherapy, interferon mediated immunotherapy and bone
marrow transplantation. The primary cause of treatment failures
in leukemia is due to the resistance of leukemic cells to
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and emergence of MDR. The
Bcr-Abl gene in CML activates the signaling pathways like PI3K/
AKT, Ras etc that confer growth factor independent proliferation
[1]. In addition, CML cells are resistant to induction of apoptosis
by variety of agents, such as TNFa, CD95/FasL etc. [4].
Although, the advent of the abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib,
has revolutionized the treatment of CML [42], approximately
30% of CML patients develop intolerance to imatinib either due
to point mutation or gene amplification [43]. Activation of Src-
kinases, also contribute to resistance in some cases [44]. To reverse
the resistance mechanism and to reduce the side effects of drugs, a
promising approach is to combine the conventional chemotherapy
with applications of nanotechnology [45]. Palama et al. have used
microcapsules for encapsulating imatinib drug and achieved
increased drug retention and antitumor activity in CML stem

pac, pac-MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs (10 ng/ml) in K562 cells.

cells and also improved the ex vivo purging of malignant
progenitors from patient autografts [46].
The up-regulated P-glycoprotein that increases the drug-efflux
is considered as the key event for establishment of MDR in cancer
cells and to counteract this, P-gp blockers and targeted drug
deliverers are the major approaches [47,48]. The targeted
nanoparticles have attracted much attention due to their active
targeting property. Selective expression of a cell surface antigen on
target cells provides an opportunity for the antibody based therapy
for both leukemia and solid tumors [47]. C-type lectin molecules
are identified as potential receptors expressed on normal myeloid
and leukemic blast cells [36]. Our results also demonstrated about
five fold increase in the uptake efficiency after conjugation of lectin
glycoprotein to the nanocarriers. This higher uptake of lec-pac-
MNPs helped in delivering appropriate therapeutic concentration
of paclitaxel to the K562 cells and in turn induced the cytotoxicity
effect leading to apoptosis.
Another important parameter in chemotherapy is the availabil-
ity of drug in the blood circulation and eventually to the target
tissues. Studies have shown that many anticancerous drugs have
short half-life in body circulation which in turn cripples their
potentiality as a drug against cancer [49]. In this regard,
nanoparticulate formulations maintain the therapeutic potential
of the drug by increasing its bioavailability in serum. In our study,

we have compared the kinetics of native pac, pac-MNPs and lec-
pac-MNPs and found that the pac-MNPs formulations have a
prolonged period of circulation even up to 48 h. Furthermore,
after 48 h of treatment, the pac-MNPs treated rats have a
therapeutic concentration of paclitaxel in serum whereas the
native pac treated rats did not show a detectable concentration.
This prolonged bioavailability of nanoformulations is may be due
to the fact that pac-MNPs formulations are able to escape the RES
system which the native pac cannot do. This suggests that the
above pac-MNPs due to its high bioavailability for longer time in
serum, helps to enhance the therapeutic index of paclitaxel.
Paclitaxel disrupts the formation of normal spindles at
metaphase, leading to arrest of cells at G2-M phase of the cell
cycle. Jordan et al. have demonstrated that mitotic block induced
by low concentrations (10 nM) of paclitaxel results in abnormal
mitotic exit and apoptotic cell death [50]. Our results demon-
strated higher G2-M phase arrest in K562 cells at 10 ng/ml of
paclitaxel and the targeted nanoformulation showed higher
amount of G2-M arrest. The cytotoxicity studies of paclitaxel on
K562 cells revealed that pac-MNPs showed lower IC50 value than
native pac suggesting the efficacy of the nanocarrier system and
furthermore, the targeted nanoparticles showed the lowest IC50
value suggesting the expediency of targeted drug delivery system
(Figure 5). Also, the apoptosis study results obtained from
morphological analysis and FACS analysis showed that after
48 h of treatment, the apoptotic population was highest in case of
conjugated nanoparticles than that of the unconjugated MNPs and
the native drug (Figure 7 A, B).
Our data provides the evidence that paclitaxel could activate
both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis in K562 cells
(Figure 11). The extrinsic pathway is not induced by the Fas ligand
mediated caspase 8 activation pathway. It has been previously
established that caspase-8 is the most proximally activated caspase
within the TRAIL mediated death signaling pathway [4] Also, it
has been suggested that TRAIL-induced loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential was caused by cleavage of Bid via activation
of caspase-8 [51]. Bid possesses the biochemical activity to induce
cytochrome c release by translocating the Bax protein to the
membrane of mitochondtria [52]. So, the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway might have activated by the TRAIL induced activation of
caspase 8. Caspase-8 is thought to propagate the death signal by
direct proteolytic processing of downstream caspases such as
caspase-3. The activation of caspase 8 dependent apoptotic
pathway in Bcr-Abl positive cell line was also confirmed in
Kcl22 cells (Figure 10 C). Thus, the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in
Bcr-abl positive cell lines involve the caspase 8 dependent cascade.
In case of Bcr-Abl negative Jurkat cells also, paclitaxel induces
apoptosis through caspase 8 dependent pathway (Figure 10 D).
Caspase 8 dependent apoptosis in Jurkat cells after treatment with
paclitaxel was also observed by Janssen et al. [53].
The pac-MNPs formulations showed a decrease in the level of
Bcr-Abl expression. But, it is known that paclitaxel ascertains its
function by phosphorylation of different signaling proteins and
Bcr-Abl is a tyrosine kinase which needs to be dephosphorylated
for its downregulation. So, paclitaxel cannot directly downre-
gulate the Bcr-Abl. Rather, the experimental results revealed that
paclitaxel establishes its antileukemic effects by inducing
p38MAPK and JNK pathways in K562 cells. p38MAPK is the
mammalian orthologue of yeast HOG kinase that participates in
multiple signaling cascades regulating cellular responses generated
against cytokines and/or stress-signals [54]. Dumka et al. have
demonstrated the key role of p38 kinase for the antileukemic
effects of dasatinib [44]. Other studies have also implicated p38 in
the multilineage differentiation of Bcr-Abl expressing K562 cells in
response to various agents suggesting a key role for p38MAPK in
the induction of antileukemic responses in Bcr-Abl transformed
cells [55,56]. The MAPkinases also help in initiating the stress
activated JNK pathway. Our results have suggested that with the
treatment of paclitaxel nanoformulations, with increasing time
period, the level of c-Jun has decreased and the level of p-c-jun has
increased (Figure 9 A). Different experimental evidences also
suggest that paclitaxel helps in activating the JNK/SAPK signal
transduction pathway in various human cell types and induces
apoptosis [57]. The activity of JNK is tightly regulated by protein
kinases and JNK-specific phosphatases. Phosphorylation of serines
63 and 73 in the c-Jun transactivation domain is known to increase
c-Jun activity [58].
Under normal growth conditions, the c-Abl kinase undergoes
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, which may be regulated in part by
14-3-3 binding to the Abl in the cytoplasm (Figure 11). In contrast,
the oncogenic Bcr-Abl kinase localizes exclusively in the
cytoplasm. C-Jun amino-terminal kinase is known to induce
phosphorylation of 14-3-3 proteins disrupting a c-Abl/14-3-3
cytoplasmic complex that leads to nuclear translocation of the
oncogenic Bcr-Abl, that leads to genomic instability of Bcr-Abl
(Figure 11) [38]. The downregulation of Bcr-Abl gene after
treatment with pac-MNPs was observed in both the CML cell lines
i.e, K562 and Kcl22 (Figure 10 B, C). Inhibition of Bcr-Abl, leads
to abrogation of survival pathways, such as Erk1/2, Stat5 and Akt
etc. [1]. The downregulation of survival pathways and activation
of JNK and p38MAPK stress activated pathways triggers the
apoptotic signal cascade (Figure 11).
It is quite evident that lec-pac-MNPs could be used as feasible,
safe and effective agents to target CML. The discrete morphology
and size as revealed from TEM and by particle size analyzer
demonstrated the high stability of the nanocarrier, that could
escape from the RES [23,59]. Further, MNPs have the potential to
revolutionize current approaches to clinical diagnosis and
therapeutic treatment. MNPs have remarkable potentiality for
precise delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs in a targeted manner
as these particles can be steered by an external magnetic field to
reach the targeted site. Also, these can be used as contrast agent
for MRI due to the inherent superparamagnetic property which is
helpful in disease detection, monitoring of drug delivery at
diseased sites and tumor regression [60]. Previous studies have
already proved MRI to be an efficient tool for detection and
monitoring of multiple myeloma including leukemia before and
after treatment [61,62]. Ito et al. have shown that early detection
of leukoencephalopathy of acute lymphocytic leukemia is possible
with the aid of MRI [30]. Our pac-MNPs could also act as image
contrast agent in MRI by shortening the T2 relaxation time
(Figure 2 A, B). With increasing concentrations, the MR intensity
gradually decreased. Thus, pac-MNPs could act both as drug
delivering and imaging contrast agent. This exemplifies the
effectiveness of pac-MNPs as a therapeutic and simultaneously a
diagnostic and monitoring tool in the treatment of leukemia.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that
lectin conjugated paclitaxel loaded MNPs can act on CML cells
effectively even at nanogram concentration by persuading higher
uptake and targeted delivery of therapeutic concentration. In in
vivo system the pac-MNPs showed prolonged blood circulation
time suggesting the effectiveness of the formulation in evading the
RES system and increasing the bioavailability of paclitaxel.
Paclitaxel formulations can augment the antileukemic activity by
coordinating different apoptotic signaling cascades. The extrinsic
apoptotic pathway gets activated in a Fas-L indepdent manner by
TRAIL induced activation of caspase 8. Further, the Bcr-Abl
oncoprotein, which is causatively linked to CML pathogenesis,

becomes instable due to activation of JNK pathway. Besides the
therapeutic efficacy, the magnetic nanocarriers could help in early
diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma including leukemia
before and after treatment. Thus, paclitaxel in combination with
magnetic drug carrier can act as a novel theranostic mediator in
treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia.

methylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrasodium bromide) reagent,
lectin, DAPI (4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), JC-1 dye and the
Annexin-V FITC apoptosis kit were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). GMO was procured from Eastman
(Memphis, TN). N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N’-ethyl-Carbodii-
mide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-Hydroxy Succinimide (NHS)
were procured from Fluka, Sigma Aldrich, Belgium. Paclitaxel was
obtained from Shaanxi Schiphar Biotech Pvt Ltd, China. Primary
antibodies for Bcr-Abl, p53, p21, Fas-L, p38kinase and b actin and
the secondary antibodies were purchased from Santacruz
Biotechnology, CA, USA. The primary antibodies for Caspase
3, Caspase 8, Caspase 9, PARP-1, Bid, Bax, Bad and Bcl-2 were
purchased from Cell Signaling, MA, USA. All other chemicals
used were of analytical grade obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO,
USA). Milli Q water purged with nitrogen (N2) gas was used in all
steps involved in the synthesis and formulation of MNPs [15].
Synthesis and physical characterization of Pac-MNPs
Pac-MNPs were synthesized following our previous protocol
[15]. To determine cellular uptake of the pac-MNPs, 6-coumarin
was taken as a model fluorescent probe as its efficiency has been
already proved [17,59]. To formulate 6-coumarin-MNPs, 50 ml of
6-coumarin solution (1 mg/ml) was added to the MNP dispersion
instead of drugs during formulation. The different physiochemical
characterizations like size, physical state of pac inside pac-MNPs
were done using TEM and Differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) [15,27].
The surface properties of the pac-MNPs were observed by an
atomic force microscope (JPK nanowizard II, JPK instrument,
Bouchestrasse, Berlin, Germany) consisting of pyramidal cantile-
vers with silicon probes having force constants of 0.2 N/m [63].
Briefly, a sample of nanoparticles (1 mg/ml) was dissolved in PBS
(0.1 M, pH 7.4), sonicated (VC 505, Vibracell Sonics, Newton,
USA) for 1 minute in an ice bath and then placed on freshly
cleaved mica plates. The sample was allowed to dry for 1 hour at
room temperature and then scanned using a contact mode
cantilever set at frequency 13 kHz and scanned at a speed of 1 Hz.
The images were analyzed using JPK data processing software.
Lectin Conjugation to pac-MNPs
The lectin glycoproteins were conjugated to pac-MNPs and 6-
coumarin-MNPs using EDC/NHS chemical conjugation follow-
ing our previous protocol [15]. The percentage of conjugation was
determined using Micro BCA kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) using a
microplate reader (Synergy HT, BioTek Instruments, Inc.,
Winooski, VT) in a indirect method by measuring the amount
of lectin present in the supernatant [59].
Quantification of drug entrapped and release kinetics
study
Quantification of the drug incorporated in the MNPs and its
release from the MNPs before and after lectin conjugation was
carried out through RP-HPLC following our previous protocol
[15]. In brief, ,1 mg of lyophilized paclitaxel loaded MNPs were
dissolved in 1 ml of acetonitrile and sonicated in an ice bath for
1 min, at 55 watt (VC505, Sonics Vibracell, Sonics and Materials
Inc., Newtown, USA) and kept in shaker at 37uC at 150 rpm
(Wadegati Labequip, India) for 24 h for the entrapped drug to
come out from the formulation. After that, the samples were
removed and centrifuged for 10 min at 13, 800 rpm at 10uC
(Sigma microcentrifuge, 1–15PK, Osterode, Germany). The
analysis of samples were done by reverse phase isocratic mode
of HPLC with using Agilent 1100 (Agilent technologies,
Waldbronn Analytical Division, Germany) which consists of a
column (Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18, 15064.6 mm, i.d). For
estimation of paclitaxel, 20 ml of the sample was injected manually
in the injection port and were analyzed with the mobile phase of
acetonitrile: water (80:20 v/v), delivered at flow rate of 1 ml/min
with a quaternary pump (Model No -G1311A) at 25uC with
thermostat (Model No - G1316A). The drug level was quantified
by UV detection at 228 nm with a diode array detector (DAD,
Model -G 1315A). The standard curve of paclitaxel was prepared
under identical conditions. The amount of paclitaxel in pac-MNPs
was determined from the peak area correlated with the standard
curve. The release kinetics of paclitaxel was carried out for a time
period of three weeks.
Preparation phantom agar gels for imaging
Phantom agar gels of pac-MNPs were prepared to check the
ability of pac-MNPs as contrast agents following our previous
protocol and relaxation measurements in phantom gels were done
[24]. In brief, different concentration range of pac-MNPs (0–
50 mg/ ml) were prepared in PBS (0.1 M, pH = 7.4). A 2.5% w/v
agar solution was prepared by heating 500 mg of agar in 20 ml
PBS at 80uC for 10 min. For preparing phantom gels, 320 ml of
the agar solution was mixed with 1680 ml of pac-MNPs suspension
at each concentration and was preheated to avoid gelation while
mixing.
Relaxation measurements of magnetic nanoparticles in
phantom gels
To test the T2 relaxivity of pac-MNPs different concentrations
of pac-MNPs were taken in gel. Further, to test the diagnostic
efficiency of pac-MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs in leukemic cells,
different concentrations of pac-MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs treated
K562 cells were taken in gel for T2 relaxation analysis. Tubes
containing the gel were positioned in a Bruker Biospec 4.7 T MRI
Scanner (BIOSPEC Bruker BioSpin MRI GmbH, Germany)
using a 72 mm resonator as transmitter/receiver coil following our
previous protocol [24]. To estimate the transverse relaxation time
(T2) for each sample, coronal images (slice thickness = 2 mm) were
acquired at various echo times (TE) from 20 ms to 320 ms with a
repetition time (TR) of 10,000 ms. Similarly, T1 relaxation time
for each sample was measured by varying TR between 15.4 ms
and 10,000 ms while keeping TE constant at 10 ms. MR signal
intensity were calculated by drawing uniform circular ROIs
0.26 cm2
).
Cellular uptake studies
Cellular uptake efficiency was determined by flow cytometry
[64]. Briefly, 6 well plates (Corning, NY, USA) were seeded with
K562, Kcl22 (both are Bcr-Abl positive) and Jurkat cells (Bcr-Abl
negative) at 16105
cells per well density and incubated at 37uC
overnight. The cells were treated with 1 ml of freshly prepared
medium containing native 6-coumarin, 6-coumarin-MNPs or lec-

6-coumarin-MNPs equivalent to 30 ng/ml of native 6-coumarin
and incubated for 2 h at 37uC in CO2 incubator (Hera Cell,
Thermo Scientific,Waltham, MA). Cells treated with only medium
were used as respective controls. At the end of the incubation
period, the cells were washed three times with cold DPBS
(Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline) and centrifuged at
1000 rpm (SIGMA 3K30, Munich, Germany) to wash out excess
6-coumarin or 6-coumarin-MNPs or lec-6-coumarin-MNPs,
which were not taken up by the cells. The cells were then taken
for FACS analysis (FACScan flow cytometer, Becton Dickinson).
In all FACS analysis, cell debris and free particles were excluded
by setting a gate on the plot of side- scattered light (SSC) vs
forward-scattered light (FSC). A total of 10,000 gated cells were
analyzed. The increase of fluorescence in the cells treated with
MNPs relative to that in the untreated control cells was expressed
as mean fluorescence increase relative to control. To substantiate
the fact of lectin mediated enhanced uptake, a competitive
inhibition assay was carried out in K562 cells (lectin positive cell
line) for which, varying concentrations of free lectin (0.5 mg – 5 mg)
was added in addition to lectin-6-coumarin-MNPs (30 ng/ml) and
the uptake study was carried out. In addition, the lectin receptor
mediated uptake was observed in lectin negative HEK293 cell line
[36].
In vivo Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out to study the
bioavailability of the native pac, pac-MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs.
The experiment on animals was performed with the permission of
Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of Institute of Life
Sciences, Bhubaneswar, India. The in vivo pharmacokinetic study
was performed after intravenous injection, (dose- 20 mg/kg) to the
Wistar rats (male, ,300 g, six per experiment). Blood samples
were withdrawn from the retro-orbital plexus at various times
(30 min, 2 h, 6 h, 24 h and 48 h) and centrifuged using SIGMA
1-15K (Germany) to collect the serum at 12,000 rpm for 1 min at
4uC. To 50 ml of serum 450 ml of acetonitrile was added for
deproteinisation and the resulting mixture was again centrifuged at
12,000 rpm for 3 min at 4uC. The supernatant was taken for
HPLC analysis using our standardized protocol (already men-
tioned in quantification of drug entrapped in the materials and
method section).
Cytotoxicity study
To find out the cytotoxicity of the native pac, pac-MNPs and
lec-pac-MNPs on K562, Kcl22 and Jurkat cells, mitogenic assay
was carried out after 48 h of treatment with varying concentra-
tions of native pac, pac-MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs following our
previous protocol [15]. Cells were seeded at 3,000 per well in 96
well plate (Corning, NY, USA) and kept in the incubator for
overnight. Different concentrations of native pac, pac-MNPs and
lec-pac-MNPs (0.1 ng–mg/ml) were added to the cells and
incubated for 48 h at 37uC. After the specified incubation time,
10 ml MTT (Sigma) was added, and the plates were incubated for
3 hours at 37uC in a cell culture incubator following which the
intracellular formazan crystals were solubilized in dimethyl
sulfoxide and the color intensity was measured at 540 nm using
a microplate reader (Synergy HT, BioTek Instruments, Inc.,
Winooski, VT). The antiproliferative effects of different treatments
were calculated as a percentage of cell growth with respect to
control.
Cell cycle Analysis
Cell cycle is an important phenomenon that plays a crucial role
in developmental pathways, and is frequently deregulated in many
cancer diseases. The distribution of DNA in the cell cycle was
studied by flow cytometry [59]. In brief, 26105
cells/ml were
grown in 25 cm2
culture flasks (Corning, NY, USA) containing
5 ml media and incubated overnight at 37uC. Next day, 5 ml of
media with native pac, pac-MNPs and the lec-pac-MNPs
(Concentration- 0.1 ng/ml, 1 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml) were added
to the flasks and the cells were incubated for 24 h and 48 h in CO2
incubator at 37uC. Cells treated with only medium was used as
controls. After incubation time period, the cells were collected and
were washed twice with DPBS. The collected cells were stained
with propidium iodide. The cell cycle distribution of the cells was
determined by analyzing 10,000 gated cells using a FACScan flow
cytometer with Cell Quest software (FACS Calibur; Becton-
Dickinson, San Jose, CA). All experiments were performed in
triplicates.
Annexin V FITC assay
Percentage of apoptosis was determined by using Annexin V
FITC and propidium iodide apoptosis kit (Sigma) [65]. In brief,
56105
K562 cell/ml were grown in 25 cm2
culture flasks
(Corning, NY, USA) containing 5 ml media and incubated
overnight at 37uC. Next day, the media was removed and 5 ml
fresh media containing 10 ng/ml of native pac, pac-MNPs and
lec-pac-MNPs were added to the flasks and incubated for 24 h and
48 h. After the particular incubation time period, the cells were
collected and washed three times with DPBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4).
Then 500 ml of 16binding buffer was added, to that 5 ml of
Annexin V-FITC and 10 ml propidium iodide was added and
incubated at room temperature in dark for 10 min. Cells without
any drug treatment were taken as negative control. Then flow
cytometry analysis was done by analyzing 10,000 gated cells using
a FACScan flow cytometer and Cell Quest software (FACS
Calibur; Becton-Dickinson, CA, USA). All experiments were
performed in triplicates.
Cell death study by confocal microscopy
In brief, 26105
K562 cells were seeded in 6 well plates and
incubated overnight at 37uC. Next day, the cells were treated with
native pac, pac-MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs (10 ng/ml) and
incubated for 24 h and 48 h. After the period of incubation, the
cells were washed two times with DPBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4) and
fixed with formaldehyde and stained with DAPI. Then, the cells
were washed and imaging was done with confocal laser scanning
microscopy (Leica TCS SP5, Leica Microsystems GmbH,
Germany) using the 60 X oil immersion lens with argon laser at
488 nm to detect the nuclei [66].
Cytofluorometric analysis of mitochondrial membrane
potential (Ym)
Both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis leads to
decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential which could help
in release of cytochrome C. So, to know the effect of different
formulation compared to the native drug, mitochondrial mem-
brane depolarization study was done in K562 cell lines by using
flow cytometry [26,41]. Briefly, 56105
cells were grown in 25 cm2
culture flasks (Corning, NY, USA) containing 5 ml media and
incubated overnight at 37uC. The cells were exposed to a
particular concentration (10 ng/ml) of native pac, pac-MNPs
and lec- pac-MNPs and incubated at 37uC for 24 h and 48 h.
After required incubation time, the cells were washed three times
with DPBS (0.1 M. pH, 7.4). Then, the cells were re-suspended
with 1 ml DPBS (0.1 M pH, 7.4) and the cationic dye JC-1 (3 mg/
ml) was added and incubated for 10 min at 37uC to allow a

potential-dependent accumulation of the dye in mitochondria.
The cells were washed with DPBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4) twice and
analyzed by using FACScan flow cytometer and Cell Quest
software Caliber (Becton-Dickinson, CA). All experiments were
performed in triplicates.
Immunoblotting to reveal apoptotic pathway
To study the pathway by which apoptosis might have occurred,
western blot analysis was performed. In brief, 56105
K562 cells
were grown in 25 cm2
culture flasks (Corning, NY, USA)
containing 5 ml media and incubated overnight at 37uC. Next
day, the media was removed and 5 ml of fresh media containing
10 ng/ml of native pac, pac-MNPs and lec-pac-MNPs were added
to the flasks and incubated for 24 h and 48 h. After the time of
incubation, protein was isolated following the protocol of Acharya
et al. [59]. Protein lysates containing 60 mg of protein were
separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF
membrane. Then, the membrane was blocked with 5% blocking
solution (nonfat dry milk for unphosphorylated proteins and
Bovine Serum Albumin for phosphorylated proteins) and
incubated with different primary antibodies (Bcr-Abl, Caspase 3,
Caspase 8, Caspase 9, PARP-1, p53, p21, Fas l, p38 Kinase, c-Jun,
Bid, Bcl-2, Bax, Bad and b actin in 1:1000) for 1 h at room
temperature. After that, the membrane was washed and treated
with HRP conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) for
40 min at room temperature. The immunoblots were visualized
using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL;
Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL).
RT-PCR analysis
RNA was extracted from K562, Kcl22 and Jurkat cells using
QuiAmpH RNA blood Mini Kit (Quiagen, Valencia, CA) and the
RNA (1.5 mg) was reverse transcribed using First strand cDNA
synthesis kit (Fermentas International INC, Ontario, Canada).
Quantitative real time PCR was carried out using qPCR
‘Mastermix Plus’ for SYBR Green I-dTTP (Urogentec, Belgium)
in 25 ml of PCR reaction mixture containing 1 ml cDNA and primer
concentration (6 picomol) using Real time PCR (DNA Engine
Opticon2, MJ Research Incorporated, BioRad, Philadelphia, USA).
The following primer pairs synthesized from Sigma, USA were
used: b-actin: forward, 5’- CTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAAT-
3’ and reverse, 5’- AATGTCACGCACGATTTCCCGC -3’,
BCR/ABL: Forward: 5’- GGAGCTGCAGATGCTGACCAAC-
3’ and Reverse: 5’-TCAGACCCTGAGGCTCAAAGT-3’, Bcl2:
Forward: 5’- GGA TTG TGG CCT TCT TTG AG -3’ and
Reverse: 5’ CCA AAC TGA GCA GAG TCT TC 3’, Caspase -3:
Forward: 5’-GCTATTGTGAGGCGGTTGT-3’ and Reverse: 5’-
TGTTTCCCTGAGGTTTGC-3’, Caspase 8: Forward: 5’-CG-
GGATCCGCCACCATGGACTTCAGCAGAAATC-3’ and Re-
verse: 5’-TCCCCCGGGCACCATCAATCAGAAGGG-3’, Bax:
Forward: 5’-TTTTGCTTCAGGGTTTCATC-3’ and Reverse:
5’-GACACTCGCTCAGCTTCTTG-3’ and Bid: Forward: 5’-TG-
GACTGTGAGGTCAACAACG-3’ and Reverse: 5’-GCGTCC-
ATCCCATTTCTGG-3’. The relative gene copy number was
calculated by the concentration-CT standard curve method and
normalized using the average expression of b-actin [63].
Cell Culture
The cell culture experiments were carried out in three leukemia
cell lines i.e, K562, Kcl22 and Jurkat and one Human Embryonic
Kidney (HEK293) cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cells were
grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 mg/ml penicillin G and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (PAN
Biotech Gmbh, Aidenbach, Germany) at 37uC in a humidified
and 5% CO2 atmosphere maintained in an incubator (Hera Cell,
Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using a Student’s t test. The
differences were considered significant for p values of,0.05 and
very significant for p values of,0.005.
