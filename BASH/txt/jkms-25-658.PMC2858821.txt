INTRODUCTION
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is current-
ly the treatment of choice for many hematologic malignan-
cies and severe congenital or acquired disorders of hematopoi-
etic or immune system. HSCT recipients are at high risk for
a variety of pulmonary complications. Pulmonary complica-
tions occur in 25-50% of allogeneic HSCT recipients, and
can account for approximately 50% of transplant related death
(1). With prolonged survival after HSCT, there is an increased
recognition of the relatively late post transplantation syndrome
of lymphoid bronchiolitis, bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) or
bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The
latter 2 conditions are known for being the most common
causes of thoracic air-leakage syndrome (TALS), which was
defined by Franquet et al. for the presence of extra-alveolar
air including spontaneous pneumomediastinum, pneumoperi-
cardium, subcutaneous emphysema, interstitial emphysema,
and spontaneous pneumothorax (2, 3).
Since the first description of TALS by Franquet et al., the
incidence or clinical nature, effects on prognosis remains
unclear. There are only a few clinical and radiological reports
concerning this condition, and in majority of reported cases,
TALS seemed to be associated with fatal prognosis (4-6). How-
ever, the clinical and temporal course has not been well evalu-
ated. As far as we know, this is the first article reporting large
numbers of TALS among more than thousands of HSCT
patients. The purpose of this study was to describe the fatal
clinical course and significant outcome of patients with TALS
following HSCT.

Thoracic Air-leak Syndromes In Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant
Recipients with Graft-versus-Host Disease: A Possible Sign for Poor
Response to Treatment and Poor Prognosis
Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) or bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)
is one of manifestations of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a complication of
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Recently there are reports about
thoracic air-leakage syndrome (TALS), but real incidence, clinical course, and impli-
cations of TALS remain unclear. Retrospective review of 18 TALS patients among
2,177 patients who received allogeneic HSCT between January 2000 to July 2007
was done. Clinical manifestations, treatments, and outcomes of TALS were reviewed.
The incidence of TALS was 0.83% (18/2,177). The onset of TALS was mean 425.9
±417.8 days (60-1,825 days) after HSCT, and the duration was mean 16.3±21
days (2-90 days). The most common types of TALS were spontaneous pneumoth-
roax (n=14), followed by subcutaneous emphysema (n=6), pneumomediastinum
(n=5), interstitial emphysema (n=2), and pneumopericardium (n=1). TALS persist-
ed in six patients, who died during the same hospitalization. The 12 patients recov-
ered from TALS, but only 2 survived, while others died due to aggravation of GVHD.
TALS may complicate BO/BOOP and be an initial manifestation of BO/BOOP. TALS
is hard to be resolved, and even after the recovery, patients die because of aggra-
vation of GVHD. We suggest specifically in HSCT patients, when once developed,
TALS seems hard to be cured, and as a result, be related to high fatality.

Thoracic Air Leak Syndrome after Stem Cell Transplantation 659
July 2007. The database was searched for patients with the
diagnosis of pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, pneumo-
pericardium, subcutaneous emphysema, interstitial emphy-
sema, and when patients were found, their medical and radi-
ological records were reviewed. Patients with an identifiable
other than spontaneous cause of TALS or patients with autol-
ogous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation were exclud-
ed, leaving 18 cases with spontaneous cause of TALS.
All medical, radiological, and available histopathological
records were further reviewed to confirm acute or chronic graft-
versus-host disease (GVHD). The diagnosis of acute or chron-
ic GVHD was made by using published criteria for clinical
manifestation and histopathological examination of the skin,
oral mucosa, esophageal, liver, and bronchial and open lung
biopsy samples whenever possible (7-9). The diagnosis of
GVHD was determined by either histopathologic (n=9) or
clinical (n=9) evidence.
BOOP was defined as organizing pneumonia as secondary
reaction in chronic bronchiolitis. CT features regarded as rep-
resenting BOOP were bilateral, patchy, and asymmetric areas
of airspace consolidation with sub-pleural or peribronchovascular
distribution as well as patchy and asymmetric ground-glass
opacity (10). BO was defined based on clinical, histopatho-
logical and CT findings. Areas of decreased attenuation of
lung parenchyma, expiratory air trapping and subsegmental
or segmental bronchial dilatation, as well as peribronchiolar
opacities were regarded as signs of BO on chest CT (2). CT
examinations were obtained by using either a single-detector
row CT scanner (Somatom Plus 4, Siemens Medical Solutions),
or a multi-detector row CT scanner (Volume Zoom, Siemens
Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germanny). Duration of tho-
racic air-leakage was calculated from the date of occurrence
to the date of resolution on chest CT or to the moment of
death in case of persistent TALS.
This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the Catholic University of Korea (approval
number: SC09FZZ0105).
Statistics
Descriptive statistics are expressed in terms of frequencies,
or means and standard deviation. Because the number of TALS
was small, we did not performed other statistical analysis.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Of the 2,177 patients undergoing HSCT during the assessed
8.5-yr, total 19 patients developed thoracic air leakage syn-
drome, and 18 patients could be included in the study. One
patient was excluded because he received autologous periph-
eral blood stem cell transplantation. The overall incidence
could be calculated as 0.83% (18/2,177).
Mean age of the patients was 36.3±12.3 yr old (18-64 yr
old). All patients received allogeneic HSCT, four of them were
fully matched allogeneic HSCT, however, and others were
unmatched at least more than 1 locus of HLA mismatching
(Table 1).
No patients had history of previous pneumothorax. Two
of them had pulmonary tuberculosis before allogeneic HSCT,
and they were cured after the treatment. Current smoker was
1 at the time of allogeneic HSCT, others were non-smokers.
GVHD was diagnosed after allogeneic HSCT at the mean
103.5±135.1 days (21-471 days) after HSCT by clinical,
radiological (abdominal ultrasonography, nonenhanced or
enhanced chest computed tomography), or pathological (skin
biopsy, endoscopic gastrointestinal mucosal biopsy, lung biop-
sy) method.
Treatment for GVHD continued for all patients including
steroid and immunosuppressant, but GVHD progressed in
all patients except 2 patients (No. 5 and 7).
Clinical features and outcomes of TALS
The onset of TALS was mean 425.9±417.8 days (60-1,825
days) after HSCT, and the duration was mean 16.3±21 days
(2-90 days). The most common feature of TALS was sponta-
neous pneumothroax (n=14), and followed by subcutaneous
emphysema (n=6), pneumomediastinum (n=5), interstitial
emphysema (n=2), and pneumopericardium (n=1). More than
two types of TALS appeared at the same time at 7 patients
(Table 2). In patients with pneumothorax, sidedness were
right in nine patients, left in seven patients, concurrent bilat-
eral in one, and sequential bilateral in one patient.
The causes of TALS were spontaneous in 2 survivors and
9 non-survivors. In the other 7 non-survivors, TALS occurred
after ventilator appliance due to decreased pulmonary func-
tion.
Concurrent radiological finding on chest radiograph at the
time of onset of TALS were bilateral atypical patchy consol-
idation (n=9), atypical pneumonia (n=5), pulmonary edema
(n=3), and pleural effusion (n=1).
TALS was treated according to the type of each manifes-
tation, mainly by chest tube and oxygen supply. One patient
refused the treatment. The result of treatment was poor; 12
patients recovered from TALS, while other 6 patients suffered
from persistent TALS. In 6 patients TALS persisted and died
in the same hospitalization period. In 12 patients, only 2 pati-
ents could survive. Ten patients recovered from TALS, but 6
patients died during the same hospitalization due to respira-
tory failure (n=3) and brain hemorrhage (n=1). The reason
of respiratory failure were aggravation of GVHD and concur-
rent pneumonia. The other 4 patients (No. 2, 4, 15, and 16)
died at 117-1,046 days after TALS onset due to aggravation
of lung GVHD.

DISCUSSION
Chronic GVHD is the most common non-relapse prob-
lem in HSCT patients, occurring in approximately 60% to
80% of long term survivors of allogeneic HSC transplant (11).
The true incidence of TALS in allogeneic HSCT with GVHD
related BO is unknown because of the scarcity of cases report-
ed in the literature. Franquet et al. (12) estimated the inci-
dence in his retrospective review of 9 air leak syndrome cases
as 1.05% by using yearly estimated cumulative incidence.
Another report about spontaneous thoracic air leak syndrome
in allogeneic HSCT, the incidence was 2.3% (6/300 patients)
(10). As far as we know, this study was the largest study about
TALS. We reviewed 2177 HSCT cases from January 2000
to July 2008, and we found 19 TALS, and the incidence was
0.83%.
There are three characteristics related to TALS. First, TALS
was one of clinical manifestations of BO/BOOP as underly-
ing GVHD in patients received HSCT. Second, TALS could
not be easily treated by the usual means of treating pneumo-
thorax, pneumomediastinum, or subcutaneous emphysema.
Third, TALS can be regarded as indicator suggesting poor
prognosis of the patients.
BO/BOOP, a late complication of bone marrow transplan-
tation, is associated with GVHD and is frequently fatal. BO
was first described by Roca et al. (13) in 1982 in a patient with
chronic GVHD. Since then, several studies have reported a
2% to 20% incidence of BO in HSCT patients (2). By a study
of Vogel et al. (10), the incidence of TALS among total HSCT
patients was 2.3%, and that among BO/BOOP patients was
higher, 20%. BO/BOOP are known for being the most com-
mon cause of TALS (4, 10, 14). In this study, all patients had
GVHD at the onset of TALS, and 2 were biopsy-proven BO
and BOOP, while other 16 patients diagnosed having BO/
BOOP by clinical or radiologic studies.
The condition is usually progressive and fatal, as mentioned
in other reports (15). Treatment was given according to the
type of TALS, but the response was poor; TALS persisted in
6 patients until death (33.3%). TALS resolved in 12 patients,
but the duration of TALS was not short, mean 20.7 days (2-
90 days) were required for recovery. Persistent air-leak may
require pleurodesis or pleurectomy, but in our study, it was
impossible because of the fragile condition of the patients
(15, 16).
TALS and BO/BOOP, GVHD might be related each other
in the development. Pathogenesis of BO in HSCT recipients
has not yet been well defined. It has been suggested that the
changes leading to the cicatrical form of BO may evolve from
interstitial pneumonia and BOOP (17). The cause of obstruc-
tive airway disease and BO in transplant recipient is unclear.
Postulated causes include viral infection, autoimmunity, and
damage to small airways. BO is higher in bone marrow trans-

plant recipients with GVHD than in those without (6% vs.
0%). The same applies for obstructive lung disease. Clinically
BO and obstructive pulmonary airway disease are usually man-
ifested symptomatically in the first year after transplantation
(14).
In most cases TALS is caused by alveolar rupture, leading
initially to pulmonary interstitial emphysema and then trav-
eling centrally along the bronchovascular sheaths into the
mediastinum. This pathogenetic mechanism is called the
Macklin effect and relates to a three-step pathophysiologic
process: blunt traumatic alveolar ruptures, air dissection along
bronchovascular sheaths and spreading of this blunt pulmo-
nary interstitial emphysema into the mediastinum (18). In
BOOP, localized or regional peripheral obstruction can result
in ball-valve effect, distal over distension leading to burst alve-
oli and entry of air into the bronchovascular sheath, or, in a
similar way, to Macklin effect.
However, other possible causes of TALS, such as aspergillo-
sis and Pneumocystis pneumonia, must be excluded (15). The
emphysema may result from lung injury, caused by pretrans-
plantation chemotherapy, total-body irradiation, GVHD,
immunosuppressant, or infections such as aspergillosis, can-
didiasis, and Pneumocystis pneumonia (14).
BO/BOOP can cause ALS, but BO/BOOP may often pre-
sent initially as a recurrent spontaneous pneumothroax and
then develop multi-system complications (19). It is notewor-
thy that three patients (No. 2, 9,15), BO/BOOP was diag-
nosed at the same time the occurrence of TALS. All of the 3
patients died due to aggravation of GVHD after the resolu-
tion of TALS.
TALS probably is not be the direct cause of death in post
transplant patients, but it might be an indicator showing
worse prognosis and pulmonary complications. The condi-
tion is usually fatal. In this study, the patients with TALS
showed high mortality as 16 among 18 patients died after
the development of TALS (88.9%). In our study, the most
common direct cause of death was respiratory failure associ-
ated with aggravation of GVHD, and the second was pneu-
monia. This finding coincides with that in previous litera-
ture, reported mortality of BO related with GVHD is 21-
100%, and mortality of TALS is 66.7-100% (10, 19, 20).
In conclusion, we suggest that TALS may complicate BO/
BOOP or can be an initial manifestation of BO/BOOP. TALS
is hard to be resolved, and even after the recovery, patients
hardly can survive because of aggravation of GVHD. We
suggest specifically in HSCT patients, when once developed,
TALS seems hard to be cured, and as a result, can be related
to high fatality.
