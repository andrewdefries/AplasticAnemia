Abstract
Recent scientific debate has focused on the potential for inhaled formaldehyde to cause lymphohematopoietic
cancers, particularly leukemias, in humans. The concern stems from certain epidemiology studies reporting an
association, although particulars of endpoints and dosimetry are inconsistent across studies and several other
studies show no such effects. Animal studies generally report neither hematotoxicity nor leukemia associated with
formaldehyde inhalation, and hematotoxicity studies in humans are inconsistent. Formaldehyde’s reactivity has been
thought to preclude systemic exposure following inhalation, and its apparent inability to reach and affect the target
tissues attacked by known leukemogens has, heretofore, led to skepticism regarding its potential to cause human
lymphohematopoietic cancers. Recently, however, potential modes of action for formaldehyde leukemogenesis have
been hypothesized, and it has been suggested that formaldehyde be identified as a known human leukemogen.
In this article, we apply our hypothesis-based weight-of-evidence (HBWoE) approach to evaluate the large body
of evidence regarding formaldehyde and leukemogenesis, attending to how human, animal, and mode-of-action
results inform one another. We trace the logic of inference within and across all studies, and articulate how one
could account for the suite of available observations under the various proposed hypotheses. Upon comparison of
alternative proposals regarding what causal processes may have led to the array of observations as we see them, we
conclude that the case for a causal association is weak and strains biological plausibility. Instead, apparent association
between formaldehyde inhalation and leukemia in some human studies is better interpreted as due to chance or
confounding.

Formaldehyde as a leukemogen—Weight of evidence  557
© 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.
1.  Introduction and background
Formaldehyde is produced naturally by the human body.
It is also a chemical intermediate used in the production
of some plywood adhesives, fertilizer, paper, and urea-
formaldehyde resins (Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry [ATSDR], 1999). It is found (as a preser-
vative or impurity) in many products around the home,
such as antiseptics, medicines, and cosmetics/personal
hygiene products (ATSDR, 1999). Formaldehyde is also
used for embalming and preserving biological speci-
mens (United States Environmental Protection Agency
[US EPA], 2010). Sources of exposure to formaldehyde
include occupational exposure during use or production
of materials containing formaldehyde; cigarette smoke;
off-gassing from manufactured wood products in new
mobile homes; and other new products found in homes
(e.g., fiberglass, carpets, and paper products) (ATSDR,
1999).
Studies have shown that exposure to high concentra-
tions of formaldehyde in air results in nasal cancer in
rats. Some studies in humans exposed to lower concen-
trations of formaldehyde in air in the workplace found
increased incidence of nasopharyngeal cancer, but other
studies have not found an increased risk of these can-
cers in formaldehyde-exposed workers (ATSDR, 1999;
Marsh and Youk, 2005; Marsh, 2007a, 2007b; Bachand
et al., 2010; US EPA, 2010). More recently, there has been
increased concern and scientific debate regarding the
potential for exposure to formaldehyde in air to cause
lymphohematopoietic cancers in humans, particularly
leukemias (US EPA, 2010; Bachand et  al., 2010; Beane
Freeman et  al., 2009; Hauptmann et  al., 2009; Zhang
et al., 2009, 2010a, 2010b; Pyatt et al., 2008; Golden et al.,
2006; Heck and Casanova, 2004).
The concern for formaldehyde-induced leukemogen-
esis stems from a few epidemiology studies reporting
an association between formaldehyde exposure and
increased mortality from leukemia (e.g., Beane Freeman
et  al., 2009; Hauptmann et  al., 2009), although other
studies show no such effects (e.g., Bachand et al., 2010;
Pinkerton et al., 2004). The studies reporting associations
have shortcomings, including poor disease classification
and unverified estimates of exposure. Studies have been
conducted to examine the potential for formaldehyde
in air to induce hematotoxicity in animals and humans
and leukemia in animals. The animal studies generally
reported neither hematotoxicity (Monticello et al., 1989;
Appelman et  al., 1988; Holmstrom et  al., 1989; Kerns
et al., 1983; Kamata et al., 1997; Woutersen et al., 1987;
Til et al., 1988, 1989; Johannsen et al., 1986) nor leukemia
(Albert et al., 1982; Kerns et al., 1983; Sellakumar et al.,
1985; Kamata et al., 1997; Feron et al., 1988; Til et al., 1989;
Tobe et al., 1989; Takahashi et al., 1986) associated with
formaldehyde exposure. Although a few animal studies
reported changes in one or more hematology parameters
(Dean et al., 1984; Tobe et al., 1989; Vargova et al., 1993),
two animal studies reported leukemias (Soffritti et  al.,
1989, 2002), and a few human study findings were consis-
tent with hematotoxicity from exposure to formaldehyde
(Tang et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010b), these studies were
inconsistent with other study findings and/or plagued by
possible confounding.
Despite the lack of substantial and consistent epide-
miological and toxicological evidence for formaldehyde
leukemogenesis, US EPA has concluded that formalde-
hyde should be deemed a known human leukemogen
(US EPA, 2010), citing possible modes of action put
forth by Zhang et al. (2009, 2010a). The three proposed
modes of action involve formaldehyde: (1) migrating to
and directly targeting bone marrow hematopoietic stem
cells; (2) targeting nasal stem cells (nasal-associated lym-
phoid tissue, or NALT) which then are released from the
nasal passage, circulate in the blood, and are eventually
incorporated into bone marrow, leading to leukemia; or
(3) targeting circulating hematopoietic stem cells, which
then migrate back to bone marrow, eventually leading to
leukemia. The proposed modes of action, however, find
little support in the current literature; there is a large body
of evidence indicating that inhaled formaldehyde (at rea-
sonably high exposure levels in humans, 2 ppm) does not
move beyond the nasal respiratory mucosa to increase
levels in the blood and does not cause DNA damage or
cellular transformation (in the bone marrow, circulat-
ing hematopoietic stem cells, or the NALT) beyond the
portal of entry (Lu et al., 2010, 2011; Moeller et al., 2011;
Andersen et al., 2010). These results suggest strongly that
if formaldehyde is not getting beyond the nasal respira-
tory mucosa (as indicated by its lack of genotoxicity and
cellular transformation beyond the nasal epithelial cells),
it is not likely to induce leukemogenesis (either via geno-
toxicity or another carcinogenic mode of action).
Acceptance of formaldehyde as a human leukemogen
on the strength of observed associations of exposure and
effect seen in the epidemiology studies requires accept-
ing the existence of underlying biological processes that
embody the causal forces, whether or not these under-
lying causal processes are identified. This is true of any
epidemiological association that is deemed causal, but
what is notable about formaldehyde and leukemia is that
current understanding both of leukemogenesis by other
agents (entailing toxicity to the marrow and genotoxic
attack on hematopoietic precursor cells found there) and
of formaldehyde kinetics (which appear to preclude such
effects distal to the respiratory tract) raises the issue of
whether the phenomena observed in the human studies
can be interpreted as causal and consistent with known
biology. It is not simply that the underlying biological
causal processes are unproven—or even hypothetical—
but rather, at least at first view, there seems to be no sci-
entifically plausible means for sufficient causal processes
to operate based on what is believed to be true about
formaldehyde and hematopoiesis.
In the present paper, we evaluate the scientific data
relevant to the potential causal association between
exposure to formaldehyde in air and leukemia in

humans using the structured hypothesis-based weight-
of-evidence (HBWoE) approach we have developed and
applied elsewhere (Rhomberg et al., 2010). The HBWoE
methodology is described below.
2.  Hypothesis-based weight-of-evidence
(HBWoE) evaluation
2.1. Overview of approach
Before discussing the evidence regarding formaldehyde’s
potential leukemogenicity, it is useful to address our
overall approach to the weight-of-evidence question
by outlining our method, explaining how it differs from
other approaches, and setting out why we feel our chosen
approach has value. Weed (2005) points out that the term
“weight of evidence” is often used loosely; he calls on
practitioners to articulate what they mean by the phrase
and to specify their approach. Analyses of various techni-
calapproachestoweightofevidencehavebeenofferedby
Krimsky (2005) and Linkov et al. (2009). Clearly, profes-
sional judgment is involved, but it is not enough simply
to name the evidence at hand and then announce one’s
conclusion. Our method aims to make the reasoning pro-
cess and bases for judgments explicit and transparent so
that, even if other observers differ with our conclusions,
debate can focus on the soundness of the inferences and
their connections to study results, rather than devolve
into ad hominem arguments about the identity and per-
spectives of the judges. That is, we seek to make expert
judgment a public process by focusing on the logic of the
process—not just the outcome. Ideally, rational evalua-
tion of objective evidence and scientific scrutiny of such
evaluation should be the criterion for knowledge, not
simple authority of the interpreter.
For some, weight of evidence may connote a process
for coming to a yes/no decision in the face of incomplete
or contradictory evidence—to agree on a conclusion
despite lack of definitive proof—but we seek a method,
rather, that arrives at a useful and reasoned character-
ization of the relative scientific credence that should be
placed in alternative interpretations of the data at hand
in view of the arguments for and against each alterna-
tive. That is, we aim to communicate uncertainty about
conclusions so as to enable productive discussion about
subsequent decisions.
A good weight-of-evidence analysis should attend to
all the relevant data, and not simply cite studies (or par-
ticular outcomes within studies) that tend to support or
refute a conclusion. The frequent practice of reviewing
literature by naming the positive or otherwise notable
outcomes of the included studies, emphasizing findings
by the studies’ authors, and leaving the negative results
for other endpoints or measures of effect implicit can
bias evaluations when studies are positive and negative
for different endpoints. The analysis should entail an
endpoint-by-endpoint comparative approach, on the
grounds that true causal effects should be specific (par-
ticular endpoints, not one or another of a set of arguably
related endpoints) and repeatable (within the limits of
study uncertainty and power). Although study quality
and design strengths and shortcomings should be noted,
we favor an approach that does not reject outright less-
than-ideal studies (the outcomes of which may be infor-
mative nonetheless) but, rather, tempers the conclusions
drawn. What makes poorer studies less informative is a
decreased ability to distinguish between the causative,
face-value interpretation of outcomes and the alterna-
tive interpretation that the results are spurious because
of intrusion of factors not adequately eliminated as pos-
sible influences. Thus, the rational and transparent way
to down-weight poorer studies is to consider the impact
of this ambiguity as one evaluates alternative interpreta-
tions of the data, using the patterns of concordance or
lack thereof with other studies as part of the evaluation
of the likelihood that the study in question has misled us
or informed us.
We also seek an approach that integrates inferences
across different and diverse kinds of data that can tie
together inference based on epidemiology, animal test-
ing, and mode-of-action and pharmacokinetic data.
Too often, in our view, these different realms of inquiry
are approached separately—each subset of data evalu-
ated within its own realm and according to its own
standards—and only then the conclusions are brought
together for synthesis. This approach fails to take advan-
tage of the ways in which information from one realm
can and should affect interpretation of data within
another. For instance, judgments about whether patterns
of association seen in human studies represent a causal
connection of chemical exposure and disease ought to
be based not only on the concordance and repeatability
of such patterns among human studies, they also should
consider whether animal studies show signs of the opera-
tion of the underlying biological processes. Human data
have the advantage of greater relevance to the immedi-
ate question at hand, but they suffer characteristically
from imprecise measures of exposure and effect, and,
being uncontrolled and observational, from the difficulty
of eliminating possible extraneous influential factors.
Animal studies can be controlled more precisely and the
underlying biology can be probed more thoroughly, but
the relevance of these studies is indirect and only useful
to the degree that the animals share underlying causative
processes with humans. Since species-specific effects are
known in both humans and particular species or strains
of experimental animals, lack of concordance of effect
across human and animal studies is not a definitive refu-
tation of the proposed causative process, but the reasons
for and plausibility of such species differences or other
non-concordant outcomes becomes part of the evalua-
tion of correspondence of hypotheses.
An often-overlooked aspect of weight-of-evidence
evaluation is the importance of noting when causative
explanations have been accommodated to account for
results already in hand and when post hoc additions or
modifications to hypotheses have been constructed to
Formaldehyde as a leukemogen—Weight of evidence  559

explain what might otherwise be contradictory findings.
Such modifications of explanatory models as a result
of new data are valid parts of scientific discovery as we
seek explanations and insights into possible underlying
causes through the examination of the patterns of phe-
nomena, but one needs to distinguish such a creative,
hypothesis-generating process from the subsequent test-
ing of those hypotheses with results that were not used in
formulating the proposed model of causes. To the extent
that hypotheses are supportable only with such added
assumptions and interpretations, even if these additions
are plausible and even if the data are then fully in accord
with the hypothesized explanations, this constitutes
weaker support than if the tentative explanations pre-
ceded, and were only later confirmed by, the data.
Wehavedevelopedanapproachtotheabovequestions
that we term “hypothesis-based weight of evidence” (or
HBWoE). It is hypothesis based in the sense that its criti-
cal aspect is to specify the hypothesized basis for using
information at hand to infer the existence of the ability
of an agent to cause human health impact. The “hypoth-
esis” referred to in the name “hypothesis-based weight
of evidence” consists of the proposed basis for using the
cited study results as evidence of human risk. That is, one
names the study observations that are being proposed
as giving insights into human risk and also names the
proposed basis for how those observations could be
interpreted as informative about human risk potential.
This hypothesized basis can be specific in its biological
mode-of-action underpinnings, but it can also be more
general. For instance, one might base the proposal that
an agent is a human carcinogen on observations of its
carcinogenicity in animal studies on the grounds that
rodents and humans share a good deal of common mam-
malian biology and the body of observations about how
frequently positive animal tests are found for agents with
direct human evidence for carcinogenicity. The strength
of such an inference would be judged in view of our expe-
rience from other agents regarding how often common
biology indeed seems to be operating in human and ani-
mal disease, the frequency of concordant and discordant
results, and the consistency of animal tests observed for
the particular chemical at hand.
The hypothesized basis for inference about human
risk from particular data should be seen not just as an
extrapolation, but as a generalization—it is a proposal
about something in common regarding the causal pro-
cesses in the study situation and the human population
of interest. As a generalization, it ought to apply to other
situations as well—or at least have reasons why it does
not—and one can evaluate the success of the hypothesis
at being in accord with the whole suite of relevant obser-
vationsathand.Iftherearelimitstothegeneralization—it
applies to one species but not another, to males but not
females, at this dose but not that dose—then the plau-
sibility of such exceptions in view of available evidence
and broader knowledge becomes part of the evaluation
of the hypothesis against available data. (Such inferences
and evaluations are particularly susceptible to the kind of
post hoc modification of hypotheses mentioned above,
and care must be taken to account for after-the-fact
adjustments of the hypothesis in evaluating its strength.)
2.1.1.  Hill Criteria and the concept of “accounts”
Wheneveracausalhypothesisisproposed,thereisalways
(at least implicitly) a counter-hypothesis that the com-
mon link does not exist, and the array of outcomes we see
among the studies at hand have other explanations that
do not bear the same implications about potential risk in
human target populations. When evaluating hypotheses,
we suggest that it is important to make these counter-
hypotheses explicit as well, including as much specific-
ity about the nature of these “other explanations” as can
usefully be provided, so that the alternatives can also be
evaluated against all the data. In the end, compelling
hypotheses are ones that not only are in accord with and
serve to explain patterns and concordances among the
data, but also have few ad hoc adjustments to account
for observations that do not fit; moreover, they provide
markedly more plausible explanations of the array of
results on hand than can be provided by the counter-
hypotheses. Evaluating explicit hypotheses and their
alternatives against all the data provides transparency
about the basis for expert professional judgment and
communicates how scientifically compelling alternative
explanations, with different consequences for human
risk potential, ought to be deemed.
The question of evaluating causality in epidemiologi-
cal data is often approached by applying the so-called
“Hill Criteria” developed by Sir Austen Bradford Hill (Hill,
1965). A similar or “extended Hill-Criteria” approach has
often been applied beyond the realm of epidemiology. In
view of this established practice, the question may arise:
What does HBWoE provide that is not already provided
by the Hill Criteria? First, one should note that the Hill
Criteria were developed for application to epidemiol-
ogy data, which by nature are more observational than
experimental. The criteria relate to the patterns among
observational studies that one ought to expect if a com-
mon causal effect were operating but, independently, do
not demonstrate causation. At most, adherence of data
to the criteria constrains the scope for alternative, non-
causal explanations. Epidemiology rarely has the ability
to put causal explanations to the test (other than by eval-
uating consistency with further studies), and the kind
of critical tests that can be constructed in experimental
studies, with alternative influential factors controlled, is
rarely available. Our goal of furthering the integration of
epidemiological and toxicological inference is aided by
an approach that gives experimentation, and the kind of
critical tests that it can provide, a central role.
Second, as often applied, the Criteria become some-
thing of a checklist or a set of headings for citation of out-
comes favorable or opposed to a causal hypothesis, but
each evaluation is often not done very rigorously or trans-
parently and suffers from the criticism we mentioned
560  L. R. Rhomberg et al.
 Critical Reviews in Toxicology
above—simply citing the studies that fit and announcing
a professional judgment conclusion. Hypothesis-based
weight of evidence can be seen as a process for encour-
aging rigorous and transparent evaluation of the criteria,
particularly those referring to consistency, specificity,
repeatability, and biological plausibility. In keeping with
the theme of not simply making judgments, but rather
showing the proposed basis for those judgments, HBWoE
emphasizesnotjusttheconclusionsabouteachcriterion,
but also a transparent and articulated examination of its
logical and evidentiary basis. To rigorously address the
question of biological plausibility, one needs to follow a
method similar to what we propose.
Finally, as Bradford Hill originally intended, his
criteria (which he called “postulates”) were designed
to articulate the basis for judgments and facilitate the
integration of evaluations across criteria, not simply as
a checklist for which, if enough features of the array of
data seemed to fit, causality could be concluded. Hill
saw the postulates as guides to thinking rather than as
measures of evidence. In our reading of Hill’s original
paper, his intent for the application is along precisely
the lines we propose—the evaluation of a specific causal
hypothesis against alternative non-causal explanations.
Bradford Hill makes explicit the importance of consider-
ing alternative “accounts” of the observations at hand in
stating:
None of my nine viewpoints can bring indisputable
evidence for or against the cause-and-effect hypoth-
esis and none can be required as a sine qua non. What
they can do, with greater or less strength, is to help us
tomakeupourmindsonthe fundamental question—is
there any other way of explaining the set of facts before
us, is there any other answer equally, or more, likely
than cause and effect? (Hill, 1965) [emphasis added]
The essence of the “accounts” (which we put forth in
this context as a technical term) is that they constitute
being explicit about Bradford Hill’s “ways of explaining
the set of facts before us.” They are not conclusions or
findings but, rather, provisional proposals for the reasons
behind the set of observations at hand.
Hypothesis-based weight of evidence comes down
to evaluation of alternative accounts. An account is a
set of proposed explanations and hypotheses that could
be put forth to explain all of the observed data at hand.
The array of all observations among all relevant studies
comprises the fixed set of available facts; the challenge
of scientific investigation is to discern what causes and
processes account for those facts having come out as
they did. Among the explanations that could be tenta-
tively proposed are causal underlying processes that, if
true, would lead to observed patterns and apparent con-
nections within and among studies, but one could also
entertain explanations that attribute particular outcomes
to chance fluctuations, biases in measurement or report-
ing, confounding factors, operation of case-specific
influences of unknown nature, or other such reasons. In
the end, all the facts have to be accounted for by some
combination of these, since the study outcomes came
out as they did for some reason, even if we do not have
clear ideas of what those reasons are. Any one proposed
set of such reasons constitutes an account—a tentative
“story” as to why the facts are as they are.
Clearly, there could be an infinite set of different
accounts, but, in practice, there will be a few major con-
tenders. Since the purpose of the weight-of-evidence
evaluation is to identify underlying causal factors of
relevance to our larger question, the key account will
be one that proposes such an underlying causal factor.
Such an account is centered on the proposed ability of a
chemical to cause and increase the frequency of appear-
ance of a particular toxic effect, put forward as a reason
behind the existence of much of the apparent patterns
and connections within and among studies. But there
may be some facts on hand that are not readily attributed
to such a factor, either ones that appear to contradict the
general operation of the hypothesized cause or ones that,
although not overtly contradicting, nonetheless are not
explained by the key causal hypothesis. These facts need
tentative explanations as well, from which subsidiary
explanations also become part of the account.

denies the existence of the key causal factor and instead
attributes the facts that appear to be explained by such a
factor to other causes, either an alternative causal prin-
ciple or simply a set of case-specific reasons under which
any appearance of patterns within and across studies is
mere happenstance. When one doubts the outcomes of a
poor-quality study, one is in effect entertaining the pos-
sibility that some array of other factors or reasons (beside
the one the study aimed at characterizing) has accounted
for the outcomes, and the study’s design does not allow
one to attribute the outcomes confidently to the nomi-
nally tested influence.
When the “causal” account’s plausibility overwhelms
the alternative’s, which by comparison seems to lack
non-arbitrary reasons to deny the apparent patterns of
causation, then we can feel confident that we have char-
acterized a truly causal factor. But we undertake weight-
of-evidence evaluations precisely when the case is not
so clear—when the causal account itself has many facts
that require modification or assumed special conditions
of the causal hypothesis, or when there are apparently
refuting facts that must be explained away as potential
counterexamples. In short, weight of evidence is applied
when the data at hand have contradictions and limita-
tions such that even the optimal account requires ad hoc
elements and assumptions to account for at least some
of the problematic facts. The weight of evidence for the
existence of the key causal factor consists of the com-
parative plausibility of the alternative accounts—the one
that invokes it and the one that denies it. The credence we
should give to an account and its implications for human
health risk assessment depends on the degree to which it

provides a more satisfactory and plausible accounting of
the array of observations at hand than do any competing
accounts. That is, we see the metaphor of “weight” of evi-
dence as being evaluated with a two-pan balance—the
relative plausibility of competing accounts—rather than
as a single scale showing how much evidence in accord
with a conclusion can be accumulated. Our approach
to revealing and characterizing the plausibility of each
account is to “unpack” the set of explanations they
invoke, noting how much each strains credulity in view
of the data at hand and wider knowledge of the relevant
science. The explanations in each account need not be
proven—what is important is that one set out the follow-
ing questions:
What is being proposed as causal and generaliz-•	
able phenomena (i.e., what constitutes the basis for
applying observations of biological perturbations or
realized risks in other contexts to project potential
risks to humans as they are exposed)?
What is being proposed as the basis for deviations•	
that lead to observations that do not fit the hypoth-
esized causal model (i.e., that would otherwise be
counterexamples or refutations)?
What assumptions are made that are ad hoc (i.e., to•	
explain particulars, but for which the evidence con-
sists of their plausibility and the observations they
are adduced to explain)?
What further auxiliary assumptions have to be made,•	
and how reasonable are they in view of our wider
knowledge and understanding?
What is relegated to error, happenstance, or other•	
causes not relevant to the question at hand?
For those events or processes proposed as critical for•	
a given account, what other observable manifesta-
tions should they have? Are these other manifesta-
tions indeed found?
If either the operation or necessity of the proposed•	
critical events for a given account were disproven,
how else would one explain the array of outcomes?
2.2.  HBWoE methodology
Although HBWoE is intended to be flexible in its appli-
cation, the approach generally consists of the following
steps, which are not intended to be a checklist and may
involve an approach that is not necessarily in this order.
Systematically review all studies that are potentially•	
relevant to the causal question at hand (i.e., epidemi-
ology, mode of action, pharmacokinetic, toxicology)
and summarize the results without regard to whether
they tend to support or undermine particular inter-
pretations. All potentially relevant data and modes of
analysis, not only those featured or noted as signifi-
cant by the studies’ authors, should be included. The
aim is to specify the set of relevant observations that
can be brought to bear. Ask further questions about
the data within these studies—specifically, think
about the quality of the individual studies (strengths
and weaknesses of study design, potential for ambi-
guity of interpretation of outcomes). Note the inter-
pretation of data by the authors and how well those
conclusions are supported by the reported observa-
tions. Note instances where evidence of associations
dependsonchoosingthemostsignificantamongaset
of parallel analyses of the same data (e.g., with differ-
ent category cut-offs or different dose measures) and
note whether there is any a priori reason to favor one
mode of analysis over others. Note instances where
the interpretation of proposed causes may have been
accommodated to account for patterns in the data
after the fact (e.g., preferring one dose measure over
another because it provides a more interpretable
pattern to dose-response data). The aim is to provide
the basis for a critical review of the available studies,
rather than simply collecting the findings noted and
conclusions drawn by study authors.
Within a realm of investigation (e.g., epidemiology,•	
animal toxicology studies), examine the data for par-
ticular endpoints across studies. The aim is to evalu-
ate consistency, specificity of apparent effects, and
repeatability of outcomes. Note instances of similar
patterns across studies, species, sexes, strains, etc.,
and also instances of apparent discordance among
these. The aim is to provide the basis for judging
the apparent limitations or exceptions to proposals
about generally operating causal effects.
Identify and articulate lines of argument by which•	
results from available studies could be used to infer
the existence, nature, or magnitude of human risk.
These could be newly proposed or they could be
proposals already put forth within the scientific
community that one seeks to evaluate. Each line
of argument should specify the data on which the
inference would be based and also the reasoning
for why those data are informative about the human
risk question. Typically, the reasoning would entail
a generalization about causal forces such that some
commonality is proposed between the causal forces
seen in the study data and those that would be pre-
sumed to operate in the human target population. It
is important to specify how widely the invoked com-
monality is proposed to apply (e.g., just to humans
but not experimental animals, or just to one sex, or
just to humans and a particular strain of animals).
The proposed reasons for why the limits to general-
ization exist should also be specified, to the degree
possible (so one can evaluate whether they have an
evidentiary basis or are simply ad hoc). These lines of
argument are the “hypotheses” of HBWoE, and they
are articulated so that one can evaluate how well they
are in agreement with all of the data, how well they
would explain patterns in the data if they were true,
what other observable consequences the invoked
causal principles should have, and whether in fact
these consequences are observed.

 Critical Reviews in Toxicology
Trace through the logic within each line of evidence.•	
That is, think about how all of the relevant studies
within each line of evidence support each other, con-
sidering consistencies and inconsistencies across
studies. For example, one would do this for all of the
epidemiology studies together (i.e., apply Bradford
Hill Criteria), all of the mode-of-action and pharma-
cokinetic data together, and all of the toxicology data
together. The aim is to establish how well the hypoth-
eses being examined comport with and help explain
common patterns in the data, what data seem to
constitute exceptions or contrary outcomes to the
hypothesized causal principles, and what reasons for
such exceptions might be proposed.
Trace through the logic regarding all lines of•	
evidence as a whole and how they inform inter-
pretation of each other. Specifically, how the epi-
demiology studies as a whole, mode-of-action
studies as a whole, and toxicology data as a whole
(that we have articulated as part of Step 4) inform
interpretation of one another. The question is
whether explanations or hypothesized causal fac-
tors proposed in one realm (e.g., epidemiology)
have aspects that should be observable in others
(e.g., mode-of-action studies), enabling evaluation
of whether signs of those causal processes do or do
not appear where expected.
Next, one needs to formulate alternative accounts.•	
Each account comprises a set of proposals, hypoth-
eses, assertions, and assumptions that together
should provide a tentative story for why all of the
relevant observations came out as they did. Each of
the causal hypotheses identified in Step 5 would con-
stitute the core of an account, but the same account
should also include the proposed reasons why facts
that do not fit or are deemed to be outside the span
of generalization should not be taken as disproofs
because their non-concordance is explicable. An
account that denies a central causal hypothesis as
an explanation for an apparent association needs to
provide an alternative proposed explanation for the
observed patterns.
Finally, evaluate alternative, and competing,•	
accounts. Now that one has worked carefully through
not only each study and each individual line of evi-
dence but, importantly, considered how each line of
evidence informs the other, it is at this point that one
asks how well each hypothesis is supported by the
data and how many ad hoc assumptions are required
tosupporteachhypothesis.Therationaleandreason-
ing for how the data support (or do not support) each
account’s hypotheses, together with the plausibility
of subsidiary explanations or assumptions in view of
wider biological knowledge, constitute the basis for
evaluating the scientific support each account gets
from available data. The comparative support consti-
tutes the basis for judging the relative credence that
alternative accounts should be given.
The goal in the end is to present the lines of reasoning•	
for (not to prove or disprove) each account, based on
the science and integration of the lines of evidence,
so that the data will speak for themselves in support-
ing (or not supporting) the overarching hypotheses
that have been put forth.
By comparison of the various accounts, one may•	
be left with a variety of outcomes or proposed next
steps. The results may suggest sharpening a pro-
posed hypothesis, or there may be obvious data gaps
that can now be pursued more clearly so that each
account can be defined more clearly, or one account
may be more clearly supported by the data than other
accounts. An advantage of the HBWoE approach is
that it can help identify research that would be most
able to inform outstanding questions and resolve
ambiguous interpretations.
 In this article, we first describe an overview of the HBWoE
evaluation of formaldehyde and leukemogenesis by
describing the various accounts that must be considered
before concluding whether a possible causal association
exists between formaldehyde exposure and leukemo-
genesis. We then describe the details of our analysis for
each of the lines of evidence (epidemiology, toxicology,
pharmacokinetic, and mode of action) that form the
bases of these accounts, individually and in terms of how
each inform each other.
3.  Overview of HBWoE as applied to
formaldehyde and leukemogenesis
The HBWoE evaluation for human leukemogenesis
from inhaled formaldehyde comes down to evaluating
the comparative degree to which each of the alternative
accounts is supported by reference to scientific evidence.
In short, one is faced with a contradiction between the
apparent (though not certainly causal) association of
leukemia with formaldehyde exposure in at least some
human studies and the apparent implausibility of such a
causal effect in view of current biological understanding.
The apparent contradiction can be reconciled in one of
two ways: (1) by accepting that human risks are actually
increased and positing that the biological impossibility
of such increases is somehow mistaken—that is, since
the effect appears, it must have a possible causal expla-
nation; or (2) by concluding that doubts about possible
mechanisms have merit, and the apparent association of
formaldehyde and leukemia seen in some human stud-
ies does not in fact indicate a causal connection (and
that those studies showing lack of effect are indeed the
ones to be taken at face value)—that is, the appearance
of some apparent associations is in fact accounted for
by chance or by shortcomings in the ostensibly positive
human studies, which, according to this view, should be
deemed false-positive results.
In pursuit of the first account that suggests a causal
mechanism must exist between formaldehyde exposure
Formaldehyde as a leukemogen—Weight of evidence  563
© 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.
and leukemia because their effects are seen, several
candidate causal mechanisms have been hypothesized
(Zhang et  al., 2009, 2010a). As these mechanisms are
evaluated, it is important to consider their ad hoc nature;
rather than being suggested a priori because of plausi-
bly relevant observed properties, they are constructed
after the fact specifically to propose a remedy to the fatal
shortcoming of impossibility. Furthermore, they are
constrained by the need to offer a possible causal con-
nection between leukemia and formaldehyde inhalation
without producing observable effects that contradict
currently accepted knowledge and observations. This ad
hoc nature does not make the hypothesized mechanisms
false, but it does put a premium on finding some inde-
pendent, positive evidence of their operation and role
rather than simply relying on their ability, if true, to fur-
nish the needed mechanisms or apparent consistencies
with observations, since they were chosen in part as sup-
port of these observations and proposed mechanisms.
An alternative, and contrasting, account is that it is
not possible for formaldehyde to move beyond the nasal
respiratory mucosa to cause systemic DNA damage and
cellular transformation (in the bone marrow, circulating
hematopoietic stem cells, or the NALT), and therefore
there is no biologically plausible mechanism for form-
aldehyde leukemogenesis. This account is supported by
a large body of hematotoxicity studies (in animals and
humans); toxicokinetic, genotoxocity, and mechanistic
data in animals, humans, and in vitro; and a large body of
null epidemiology findings. Under this account, the sig-
nificant number of null epidemiology findings are con-
sidered true results, and the few positive findings in the
epidemiology studies (which have shortcomings, includ-
ing poor disease classification and poor estimates of
exposure), are likely attributable to confounding by other
exposures or to chance. If this account is true, an associa-
tion between inhalation of formaldehyde and leukemia
would be understood as not plausible for humans.
Our HBWoE evaluation compares these two accounts
by first describing what is known and what has been
interpreted from the formaldehyde epidemiology, toxi-
cology, and mode-of-action data, pointing out questions
that arise from within and across these studies and their
interpretation, the answers to (or at least discussions of)
which provide the bases for tracing the logic for each
alternative hypothesis.
4.  Weight of epidemiology evidence
regarding the association between
formaldehyde exposure and leukemia
To conduct the HBWoE analysis of the epidemiology
data regarding the association between formaldehyde
exposure and leukemia, we first conducted a literature
search, using PubMed and TOXLINE, for all human
studies measuring or estimating formaldehyde exposure
and the incidence of or mortality from any lymphohe-
matopoietic cancer. Search terms included “leukemia,”
“lymphoma,” “Hodgkin,” “non-Hodgkin,” “hematologic
neoplasm,” “myeloma,” “hematopoietic,” “lymphatic,”
“formaldehyde,” “epidemiol*,” “occupation*,” “cohort*,”
and “worker*.” We also relied on the reference lists of
several review articles and meta-analyses (e.g., Bachand
et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010a; Bosetti et al., 2008; Collins
and Lineker, 2004). We critically reviewed each relevant
study and focused particularly on two cohorts that have
received much recent attention: the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) industrial worker and embalmer cohorts.
The former was analyzed in several studies using tradi-
tional cohort study designs, whereas individuals were
drawn from the latter to conduct case-control analyses.
After providing a brief overview of the epidemiology
literature below, we describe an endpoint-by-endpoint
analysisofeachlymphohematopoieticcancerandgroups
of cancers that have been investigated. This is followed
by an HBWoE evaluation of the epidemiology evidence
with respect to the hypothesis that formaldehyde causes
leukemia.
4.1.  Overview of epidemiology investigations
Several cohort and case-control studies have been
conducted on formaldehyde exposure and lympho-
hematopoietic cancers (Tables 1 and 2). The first study
published was of pathologists and medical laboratory
technicians in the United Kingdom (UK) who were fol-
lowed through 1973 (Harrington and Shannon, 1975).
Since that time, studies of embalmers, undertakers,
funeral directors, radiologists, pathologists, anatomists,
leather tannery workers, iron foundry workers, plastics
manufacturing workers, wood industry workers, garment
workers, pest-control workers, and workers at formalde-
hyde production or usage plants have been conducted in
theUnitedStates,theUK,France,Sweden,Italy,Denmark,
Finland, and Canada. Cohort studies ranged in size from
154 to 126,347 subjects with follow-up beginning as early
as 1925 and up through 2004. Among the eight case-
control studies we identified, the largest included 1511
cases, and follow-up periods among the studies ranged
from 1940 to 2000 (Table 2). Formaldehyde exposure was
rarely measured in any study and, when it was, concen-
tration information was not available for the entire period
of employment. Owing to the limited concentration data,
exposure was typically estimated based on job descrip-
tions. Formaldehyde risks were then calculated based on
the date of hire/first exposure, minimum employment
duration, duration of employment/exposure, time since
first exposure, cumulative exposure, average exposure,
average intensity of exposure, peak exposure, and num-
ber of peak exposures. Health outcomes were coded
according to the International Classification of Diseases
(ICD) 7th, 8th, or 9th revision (Table 3). Because the
majority were coded using the 8th revision (ICD-8) and
there are few differences between the 8th and 9th revi-
sions, classifications in the following sections and the
tables refer to the 8th revision unless otherwise noted.
The health outcomes assessed included mortality from

lymphohematopoietic cancer (ICD 200–209), cancer of
lymphoid origin (ICD 200–204), leukemia (ICD 204–207),
hematopoietic cancer of non-lymphoid origin (ICD 205,
206, 208, 209), lymphatic leukemia (ICD 204), myeloid
leukemia (ICD 205), other unspecified leukemia (ICD
207), Hodgkin’s lymphoma (ICD 201), non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (ICD 200, 202), and multiple myeloma (ICD
203). The majority of studies were subject to confound-
ing by several co-exposures, many of which were not
accounted for in statistical analyses.
Several individuals and/or cohorts were analyzed in
more than one study. Beane Freeman et al. (2009) con-
ducted the most recent study of the NCI industrial worker
cohort, with follow-up through 2004. This cohort was
first studied by Blair et al. (1986), who followed workers
employed in 10 formaldehyde-producing or -using facili-
ties through 1979. Hauptmann et al. (2003) conducted a
follow-up through 1994, although it was noted by Beane
Freeman et  al. (2009) that 1006 deaths were omitted
unintentionally from this analyses (all results presented
here are from a reanalysis by Beane Freeman et al. [2009],
which included these deaths). To avoid counting infor-
mation on this cohort more than once, only data from the
most recent publication by Beane Freeman et al. (2009)
are shown in the tables, but results from the previous
studies of this cohort are discussed in the text if they are
not consistent with the latest analysis.
Coggon et al. (2003) evaluated a cohort of 14,014 UK
workers at factories where formaldehyde was used or
produced that had been evaluated previously by Acheson
et al. (1984) and Gardener et al. (1993). Acheson et al.
(1984) evaluated mortality in 7680 men first employed
before 1965 in one of six factories, with follow-up through
1981. Gardener et  al. (1993) extended the follow-up of

ing 6357 additional workers who began work after 1964.
Coggon et al. (2003) then followed the majority of these
workers through 2000. Because results are consistent
among the three analyses, only results from Coggon et al.
(2003) are discussed here.
Hauptmann et  al. (2009) conducted a case-control
study based on over 6000 embalmers (NCI embalm-
ers cohort) who died between 1960 and 1985 and were
included in proportionate mortality ratio (PMR) studies
by Hayes et al. (1990) and Walrath and Fraumeni (1983,
1984). Walrath and Fraumeni (1983) studied embalm-
ers licensed in California, Walrath and Fraumeni (1984)
studied those licensed in New York, and Hayes et  al.
(1990) assembled data on US embalmers and funeral
directors who died between 1975 and 1985. In the tables,
we present data from both Hauptmann et al. (2009) and
Hayes et al. (1990) because they use different methodolo-
gies. Data from Walrath and Fraumeni (1983, 1984) are
discussed in the text but not the tables, because study
subjects are included in the Hayes et al. (1990) analysis
and were analyzed in a similar fashion.

4.2.  Endpoint-by-endpoint analysis
In this section, we discuss each of the individual lympho-
hematopoietic cancer endpoints analyzed in the epide-
miology studies described above. Lymphohematopoietic
cancers include a group of hematopoietic and lymphoid
cell disorders that have distinct classifications based on
morphologic, cytogenic, immunophenotypic, and molec-
ular characteristics (see Vardiman, 2010, for a review of
theclassifications).Weconsidervariousgroupingsofcan-
cer types as analyzed by study authors, although results
from these analyses must be considered carefully because
each specific lymphohematopoietic cancer is a different
disease. Although some cancer types may have some
common mechanisms (e.g., pharmacokinetics), in gen-
eral, lymphohematopoietic cancers each have a distinct
etiology, so an association with one type is not necessarily
indicative of risk of another (Schottenfeld and Fraumeni,
2006). That is, if one study reports a statistically significant
finding for one cancer type (A) but not another (B), and
another study reports a statistically significant finding for
cancer type B but not A, this is not consistent evidence of
an association. In the same vein, an association between
formaldehyde and a group of cancers does not necessarily
provide evidence for all cancers in that group, as it may be
driven by one cancer type with a distinct mode of action.
Thus, it is crucial in a weight-of-evidence analysis to con-
sider each individual cancer type and the implications of
analyses of cancer groups.
For each cancer or group of cancers, we evaluated the
weight of each study based on several factors, including
the study objectives and hypothesis; the study subjects;
the exposure and health outcome assessments; the
follow-up period; the consideration of bias, confounders,
and effect modifiers; the statistical methods; the docu-
mentation and interpretation of results; and the external
validity (i.e., the bearing on the larger question at hand,
formaldehyde as a potential cause of human lympho-
hematopoietic neoplasms). For each cancer or group
of cancers, we also assessed the consistency of findings
(which included consideration of the type of exposure
metric, e.g., peak vs. cumulative) and whether any expo-
sure-response relationships were evident.
4.2.1.  All lymphohematopoietic cancers
The association between formaldehyde exposure and all
lymphohematopoieticcancerscombinedhasbeeninves-
tigated in 12 studies (Table 4). Eleven cohort and one
case-control study assessed whether study subjects had
an increased risk over the general population. Of these,
only one reported associations (Hayes et al., 1990). Hayes
et  al. (1990) found an increased proportion of deaths
attributable to lymphohematopoietic cancers among
embalmers in the NCI embalmers cohort (PMR = 1.39,
95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15–1.67).
Lymphohematopoietic cancer risks were also evalu-
ated based on one or more exposure metrics in iron
foundry workers, embalmers, and industrial workers.
Risks were not increased in formaldehyde-exposed and
unexposed US iron foundry workers (Andjelkovich et al.,
1995), and risks reported in embalmers and industrial
workers were not consistent across exposure metrics
(Hauptmann et al., 2009; Beane Freeman et al., 2009).

study of 168 embalmers (21 with leukemia) from the
NCI embalmers cohort (evaluated by Hayes et  al.,
1990) and examined lymphohematopoietic cancer risks
based on seven exposure metrics: exposed (ever/never
embalmed), peak exposure, average intensity of exposure
when embalming, 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA)
exposure, cumulative exposure, exposure duration (years
embalming), and number of embalmings. Exposure
estimates were developed from a previous exposure-as-
sessment experiment by Stewart et al. (1992). The inves-
tigators conducted trend tests for each exposure metric
including and excluding unexposed individuals. There
were no statistically significant associations between
formaldehyde exposure and lymphohematopoietic can-
cer based on any exposure metric.
BeaneFreemanet al.(2009)conductedthemostrecent
study of the NCI industrial worker cohort, with follow-up
through 2004. They examined lymphohematopoietic
risks based on exposure metrics including exposed (yes/
no), peak exposure, number of peak exposures ≥4.0
ppm, duration of exposure, average intensity of expo-
sure, cumulative exposure, years since first exposure,
and years since first exposure ≥4 ppm. Beane Freeman
et al. (2009) stated that there was no evidence that risks
increased with cumulative number of peaks ≥4.0 ppm or
for duration of exposure for any lymphohematopoietic
cancer evaluated, but they did not present results. An
association was observed with the presence of at least
one career peak exposure ≥4.0 ppm (risk ratio [RR] = 1.37,
95% CI: 1.03–1.81, ptrend
 = .02 based on exposed subjects
only and ptrend
 = .04 based on all study subjects), but not
number of peak exposures ≥4.0 ppm. Risks were also
increased with increasing peak intensity with follow-up
to 1981 (ptrend
= 0.00987 based on exposed subjects only
and ptrend
= 0.0485 based on all study subjects), but not
with follow-up from 1981-1994 or 1995-2004. Risks were
lower in those with no exposure vs. those with their first
exposure to ≥ 4 ppm formaldehyde 0-25 years earlier (RR
= 0.57, 95% CI: 0.36-0.88). This was consistent with results
of Hauptmann et  al. (2003), who followed this cohort
through 1994. In their reanalysis of this cohort through
1994, Beane Freeman et al. (2009) found that, of the six
exposure metrics, associations were only observed for
peak exposure ≥0.04 ppm (RR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.04–2.12,
ptrend
 = .02 including or excluding unexposed subjects).
4.2.2.  Cancer of lymphoid origin
Risks from cancers of lymphoid origin were examined
in four cohorts (Table 5). Both Dell and Teta (1995) and
Chiazze et al. (1997) defined cancers of lymphoid origin
as those in ICD-7 200–205 categories. Whereas Chiazze
et al. (1997) did not report increased risks, Dell and Teta
(1995) reported increased risks among plastics manufac-
turers (standardized mortality rate [SMR] = 1.69, 95% CI:
1.07–2.53). No significant associations were found in the
NCI embalmers cohort based on any of the seven expo-
suremetricsevaluated(Hauptmannet al.,2009).Analyses
of peak exposure, average intensity, cumulative exposure,
cumulative number of peaks ≥4.0 ppm, or duration of
employment also did not indicate any associations in the
NCI industrial cohort (Beane Freeman et al., 2009).
4.2.3.  Leukemia
A large number of investigations have focused on the
association between formaldehyde and leukemia
(Tables 6, 7, 8, and 9). The types of leukemia investi-
gated vary among studies, and this section focuses on
analyses of all leukemia and aleukemias (leukemias in
which the circulating white blood cells are normal or
decreased in number) combined (ICD-7 204) and lym-
phatic, myeloid, monocytic, other, and unspecified leu-
kemias combined (ICD-8 204–207 and ICD-9 204–208),
whereas later sections discuss assessments of specific
types of leukemia. Risk estimates for leukemia among
28 analyses that did not assess exposure-response
were generally null (Table 6, table 6C). Only two cohort
studies, conducted by Walrath and Fraumeni (1984)
and Dell and Teta (1995), reported increased propor-
tions or risks (PMR = 1.5, p <.05 and SMR = 2.65, 95% CI:
1.15–5.24, respectively).
There were no increased risks of leukemia in any
formaldehyde exposure group among the three studies
that assessed exposure-response and, with one excep-
tion, no exposure-response associations were reported.
Stern et al. (1987) found no association with duration of
employment as a leather tannery worker and Pinkerton
et al. (2004) found risks in garment workers were not
related with duration of exposure, time since first expo-
sure, or year of first exposure (Table 6). Beane Freeman
et al. (2009) examined associations with formaldehyde

were lower in those with no exposure vs. those with

earlier (RR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.18-0.67) and also in those

4.2.4.  Lymphatic leukemia
Results from analyses of lymphatic leukemia (ICD 204)
are similar to those reported for all leukemias combined
(Tables 6 and 7). Among the four studies that assessed
lymphatic leukemia, all risk estimates are null (Table 7,
table 7A). Blair et al. (2001) and Pinkerton et al. (2004)
reported no association between formaldehyde exposure
and mortality from lymphatic leukemia. There were no
exposure-response relationships for any of the six expo-
sure metrics evaluated by Beane Freeman et al. (2009) in
the NCI industrial cohort. This result was also observed
in this cohort with follow-up only through 1994 (Beane
Freeman et al., 2009; Hauptmann et al., 2003).
4.2.5.  Hematopoietic cancer of non-lymphoid origin
Associations between formaldehyde exposure and
hematopoietic cancers of non-lymphoid origin were
investigated in several studies (Table 8). In an early
analysis of the NCI embalmers cohort, Hayes et al. (1990)
found the PMR from polycythaemia vera or myelofibrosis
was not higher than expected, but it was from monocytic
leukemia, other (i.e., not lymphatic, myeloid, or mono-
cytic), and unspecified leukemias combined (PMR = 2.28,
95% CI: 1.29–3.52). Pinkerton et al. (2004) found no asso-
ciation with monocytic leukemia or leukemia of other or
unspecified type among garment workers (SMR = 0.92,
95% CI: 0.34–2.00).
Risks of myeloid leukemia (ICD 205), monocytic
leukemia (ICD 206), ploycthaemia vera (ICD 208), and
myelofibrosis (ICD 209) combined were examined in
recentstudiesoftheNCIindustrialworkerandembalmer
cohorts (Hauptmann et al., 2009; Beane Freeman et al.,
2009; Table 8). Beane Freeman et  al. (2009) did not
report any excess risks in the industrial worker cohort

based on analyses by peak exposure, average intensity,
cumulative exposure, cumulative number of peaks
≥4.0 ppm, or duration of exposure (Table 8). They also
found no exposure-response associations among analy-
ses including or excluding the unexposed population.
This is consistent with previous analyses of this cohort
(Hauptmann et al., 2003; Blair et al., 1986).
Hautpmann et  al. (2009) found that risk estimates
from analyses using subjects who never embalmed as
a referent category were highly unstable because of the
small number of cases in this category (n = 4, odds ratio
[OR] = 3.0, 95% CI: 1.0–9.5 for ever vs. never embalmed).
Still,amongsixexposuremetrics,therewerenoexposure-
response associations reported when unexposed refer-
ents (i.e., 0 embalmings) were included or excluded with
one exception—there was a trend reported with duration
of exposure when the unexposed group was excluded
(ptrend
 = .046) but not when it was included (ptrend
 = .348).
Because of the issues with the aforementioned analyses,
Hauptmann et al. (2009) also conducted analyses using
those who performed <500 embalmings as a referent cat-
egory.Resultsfromtheseanalyses,whichtheysuggestare
more reliable, are presented in Table 8. The majority of
risk estimates were null, except for the highest exposure
group for cumulative exposure (>34 years, OR = 2.60, 95%
CI: 1.0–6.4) and number of embalmings (>3068 embalm-
ings, OR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.00–5.70). Hauptmann et  al.
(2009) also reported that among those who embalmed
for more than 20 years, a significant increased risk of
non-lymphoid cancers was observed (OR = 3.5, 95% CI:
1.1–10.9). The p values reported for the trend tests by
Hauptman et al. (2009) are incorrect, as they are the same
as those reported for the tests which used 0 embalmers
(vs. <500) as the referent category; therefore, they are not
reported here.
4.2.6.  Myeloid leukemia
Myeloid leukemia was assessed in three case-control
studies and four cohort studies, some of which also ana-
lyzed acute and/or chronic subtypes (Table 9). Results
varied among the four studies that compared risks in
exposed vs. unexposed individuals. Stroup et al. (1986)
reported an excess in myeloid leukemia in US anatomists
(SMR = 8.8, 95% CI: not reported). Similarly, Linos et al.
(1990) reported an excess of acute myeloid leukemia
in funeral home workers, although this was based on
three exposed cases (OR = 6.7, 95% CI: 1.2–36.2). Hayes
et al. (1990) reported a significant excess proportion of
myeloid leukemia deaths overall in the NCI embalmers
cohort (PMR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.01–2.34), but found no
associations in analyses by subtype (PMRacute
 = 1.52, 95%
CI: 0.85–2.52; PMRchronic
 = 1.84, 95% CI: 0.79–3.62). Blair
et  al. (2001) conducted a case-control study of several
industrial and occupational job categories in US workers
andfoundnoassociationsbetweenintensityofformalde-
hyde exposure and acute or chronic myeloid leukemia.
Pinkerton et al. (2004) assessed myeloid leukemia in a
cohort of US garment workers and found no association
with formaldehyde exposure overall (SMR 1.44, 95% CI:
0.80–2.37) or when examined by subtype (SMRacute
 = 1.34,
95% CI: 0.61–2.54; SMRchronic
 = 1.39, 95% CI: 0.38–3.56).
There were also no trends with duration of exposure or
time since first exposure (p > .05), although risks were
increased in workers with 20 or more years since first
exposure (SMR = 1.91, 95% CI: not reported). In contrast,
there were no increased risks in workers exposed for 10
or more years with 20 or more years since first exposure
overall (SMR = 2.43, 95% CI: 0.98–5.01) or in analyses
limited to acute myeloid leukemia (SMR = 2.51, 95% CI:
0.81–5.85).
In an analysis of the NCI industrial worker cohort with
follow-up through 2004, Beane Freeman et  al. (2009)
assessed whether myeloid leukemia risk was associated
with formaldehyde estimated as peak exposure, average
intensity, cumulative exposure, cumulative number of
peaks ≥4.0 ppm (data not reported), duration of expo-
sure (data not reported), years since first exposure, and
years since first exposure ≥4 ppm. These investigators
reported no associations between any exposure metric
and myeloid leukemia, including peak exposure (RR =
1.78, 95% CI: 0.87-3.64, ptrend
= 0.13 for exposed groups),
except for lower risks in those with no exposure vs. those
with their first exposure to ≥ 4 ppm formaldehyde 0-25
years earlier (RR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.11-0.81) and higher
risks with increasing peak intensity with follow-up from
1981-1994 (ptrend
= 0.0353 based on exposed subjects
only and ptrend
= 0.210 based on all study subjects), but
not with follow-up to 1981 or 1995-2004 (Table 9). These
null results were consistent with analyses of this cohort
through1994basedoneveryexposuremetricexceptpeak
exposure, for which risks were increased (RR = 2.79, 95%
CI: 1.08–7.21, ptrend
 = .02 for exposed groups, ptrend
 = .0087
for all groups) (Beane Freeman et al., 2009; Hauptmann
et  al., 2003). There were no associations based on any
other metric in analyses.
Hauptmann et  al. (2009) conducted a case-control
study of professional embalmers, including cases from
previous studies (Walrath and Fraumeni, 1983, 1984;
Hayes et al., 1990), and assessed myeloid leukemia risk
basedonsevenformaldehydeexposuremetrics(Table 9).
Having ever embalmed was associated with myeloid leu-
kemia (OR = 11.2, 95% CI: 1.3–95.6, ptrend
 = .027), but there
was only one case who never embalmed, making this risk
estimate highly unreliable. Because of this, Hauptmann
et al. (2009) combined unexposed individuals and those
with <500 embalmings as a referent group to provide
Table 8b.  Other cohorts.

more conservative and reliable risk estimates; these are
discussed here and shown in Table 9. An increased risk
for myeloid leukemia was not reported for any exposed
group except those with more than 34 years of employ-
ment (OR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.2–12.5), more than 3068
embalmings (OR = 3.0, 95% CI: 1.0–9.2), or more than
9253 ppm-hours of cumulative formaldehyde exposure
(OR = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.0–9.6). Hauptmann et al. (2009) con-
ducted similar analyses for acute myeloid leukemia and
found no associations in any dose group. Reported p val-
ues for trend tests for total and acute myeloid leukemia
appear to be those based on analyses using 0 embalm-
ings (vs. <500 embalmings) as a referent category and are
not presented here.
Although there are some isolated findings of statisti-
cally significant associations between formaldehyde
exposure and myeloid leukemia, these have not been
found consistently either within or among studies and
are far outnumbered by null findings in the more robust
studies.
4.2.7.  Other unspecified leukemia
Most cohort and case-control studies examined other
(i.e., not lymphatic, myeloid, or monocytic) or unspeci-
fied leukemias (ICD 207) grouped with other lymphohe-
matopoietic cancer types. The ICD 207 category alone
was only examined in the NCI industrial worker cohort
(Table 10). Beane Freeman et al. (2009) reported no asso-
ciations between formaldehyde exposure and other or
unspecified leukemia based on peak exposure, average
intensity, cumulative exposure, cumulative number of
peaks ≥4.0 ppm (data not reported), or duration of expo-
sure (data not reported). These results are consistent
with previous evaluations of the NCI industrial worker
cohort (Hauptmann et al., 2003; Blair et al., 1986). Hayes
et al. (1990) examined monocytic (ICD 206) and other
unspecified leukemia (ICD 207) combined in embalm-
ers and reported an increased proportion of deaths
(PMR = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.29–3.52). This disease category
was not evaluated in the follow-up by Hauptman et al.
(2009).
4.2.8.  Hodgkin’s lymphoma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and
multiple myeloma
Cohort and case-control study results for Hodgkin’s and
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and multiple myeloma are
presented in Tables 11 to 13. Eleven assessments of form-
aldehyde-exposed vs. unexposed workers did not show
associations between exposure and Hodgkin’s lymphoma
(Table 10). In the one study that evaluated iron foundry
workers vs. the general population, risks were also not
increased (Andjelkovich et al., 1995). When exposure-re-
sponse relationships were evaluated in the NCI industrial
worker cohort, associations were reported for peak expo-
sure (ptrend
 = .01 for exposed groups) and average intensity
(ptrend
 = .05 for exposed groups) but not for cumulative
exposure, cumulative number of peaks ≥4.0 ppm (data
not reported), or duration of exposure (data not reported)
(Beane Freeman et al., 2009). This is consistent with the
earlier examination of the NCI industrial worker cohort,
for which exposure-response relationships for peak expo-
sure (ptrend
 = .04) and average intensity (ptrend
 = .03), but not
other exposure metrics, were reported (Beane Freeman
et al., 2009; Hauptmann et al., 2003).
None of the 13 epidemiology investigations reported
associations between formaldehyde exposure and non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma for any exposure metric evaluated
(Table 12). There were also no exposure-response asso-
ciations observed (Table 12).
Multiple myeloma was not associated with form-
aldehyde exposure in any of the eight groups studied
(Table 13). In the NCI industrial worker cohort, multiple
myeloma risk was higher in individuals with no expo-
sure based on all measures evaluated (Table 13). The
only association with formaldehyde reported was for
peak exposure ≥4.0 ppm (RR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.01–4.12);
however, the trend was not significant (p > .05) and there
was no association with the number of peak exposures
≥4.0 ppm. This finding was consistent with results from
earlier follow-ups of this cohort (Beane Freeman et al.,
2009; Hauptmann et al., 2003).
4.3.  HBWoE evaluation of epidemiology studies
We conducted an HBWoE evaluation of the epidemiol-
ogy data with regard to an association between formal-
dehyde exposure and leukemia. Based on review of the
data discussed in the previous section, we address the
following questions:
What are the implications of studies of individual1.	
lymphohematopoietic cancers and several group-
ings of these cancer types (e.g., all cancers of lym-
phoid origin, all of non-lymphoid origin) regarding
leukemia risks from formaldehyde exposure?
Were results from the epidemiology data consistent2.	
for different types of exposure metrics (e.g., peak
exposure, number of peak exposures ≥4.0 ppm,
cumulative exposure)? Were results dependent on
the robustness of exposure measurements, par-
ticularly for the NCI industrial worker and embalmer
cohorts?
Were co-exposures considered in the interpretation3.	
of the study results?
Were there consistent exposure-response associa-4.	
tions within and across studies?
Were there potential statistical limitations among the5.	
epidemiology studies?
How should latency be considered when interpret-6.	
ing study results? Is it possible that risks decline over
time owing to a relatively short induction-incubation
period (as proposed by Beane Freeman et al., 2009)?
 As a whole, considering these questions allows for an
assessment of the extent to which the epidemiology data
support either a causal association between formalde-
hyde exposure and leukemia or an alternative hypothe-
sis. Importantly, one needs to consider the epidemiology

data in the context of the hematotoxicity and mode-of-
action data (discussed later), as each of the three lines of
evidence inform interpretation of the other; specifically,
a claim of causation cannot be solely based on one or the
other but has to be reflected consistently across the epi-
demiology, mode-of-action, and hematoxicity data.
4.3.1.  Cancer outcome assessments likely led to disease
misclassification
There are several ways in which cancer outcomes were
defined and assessed in the formaldehyde epidemiology
studies, several of which may have led to disease misclas-
sification and/or misleading results.
With few exceptions, most studies assessed cancer
mortality, and several of the larger studies relied on
death certificates to determine cause of death (e.g.,
Beane Freeman et  al., 2009; Hauptmann et  al., 2003,
2009; Hayes et  al., 1990; Pinkerton et  al., 2004; Stroup
et al., 1986; Walrath and Fraumeni, 1983, 1984). Death
certificates do not always identify leukemia subtype,
and leukemia diagnosis was considered unreliable prior
to 1992 (Collins and Lineker, 2004; Bachand et al., 2010;
Miller et al., 1992; Percy et al., 1981, 1990, both as cited by
Collins and Lineker, 2004). Thus, relying on death certifi-
cates may have led to disease misclassification.
In addition, diagnoses of lymphohematopoietic can-
cers has evolved in recent decades, and historic records
may be inaccurate (Bachand et  al., 2010; Collins and
Lineker, 2004; Miller et al., 1992; Percy et al., 1990, as cited
by Collins and Lineker, 2004; Scott and Chiu, 2006). For
example, past classifications of lymphomas do not make
distinctions between different cell types (Scott and Chiu,
2006). This means that, within studies that investigated
subjects over many decades, individuals assigned the
same cancer actually may not have had the same cancer.
There is also an issue with assessing cancers in cat-
egories. Each different kind of lymphohematopoietic
cancer is a distinct disease with a unique etiology, set
of risk factors, and, presumably, mechanism of action.
Consequently, grouping cancer types together is not
informative regarding risks for a particular cancer type.
Any observed increased risks could be driven by risks for
one cancer type (e.g., if the majority of cancers in a group
were the same type, or one cancer type had very large
risks associated with it); a lack of risks could be indicative
of no risks among all lymphohematopoietic cancers or
that combining cancer types masks true associations
with one particular cancer type. For example, in the NCI
industrial worker cohort, the two cancers that contribute
to the association between peak formaldehyde expo-
sure and all lymphohematopoietic cancers are multiple
myeloma and Hodgkin’s disease (Beane Freeman et al.,
2009). These cancers are not associated with formalde-
hyde exposure in other studies.
In sum, disease misclassification likely led to uncer-
tain risk estimates. In addition, studies that purport to
show associations with a group of cancers that include
leukemia do not provide sufficient evidence that risk, if it
exists, is for leukemia and not another white cell cancer.
4.3.2.  Exposure assessments likely affected by exposure
measurement error or misclassification
Because of the difficulty in obtaining exposure data for
individuals in cohort and case-control studies, inves-
tigators typically estimated exposure from few, if any,
measurements of formaldehyde concentrations. For
example, Andjelkovich et  al. (1995) assigned formal-
dehyde exposures to each iron foundry worker by job
category based on midpoints of ranges from actual sam-
pling data. Pinkerton et  al. (2004) conducted analyses
based on 1 year of measured data from the 1980s and
applied it to the entire follow-up period in garment work-
ers (1955–1998). Exposure estimates in formaldehyde
workers in the NCI cohort were developed by assigning
job categories from work histories abstracted in 1980
and an expert assessment of job and tasks using current
and past measurement data (Stewart et  al., 1986; Blair
et al., 1986). Although this was considered to be a well-
conducted exposure assessment for the time, validation
of the exposure matrix was not possible, and exposures
to formaldehyde and other potential confounders after
1980 were assumed to be minimal (Beane Freeman
et al., 2009; Blair et al., 1986, 1990; Stewart et al., 1986).
Peak exposure categories (none, >0 to <0.5 ppm, 0.5 to
<2.0 ppm, 2.0 to <4.0 ppm, or ≥4.0 ppm) were estimated
and defined as short-term exposures (generally less than
15 minutes) exceeding the 8-hour time-weighted aver-
age (TWA8) category (Blair et al., 1986; Beane Freeman
et al., 2009). In the NCI embalmers cohort (Hauptmann
et al., 2009), questionnaire data were linked to data from
an exposure experiment (Stewart et al., 1992). No mea-
surements of peak exposure were available, and average
formaldehyde intensity, peak, time-weighted average,
and cumulative exposure were estimated using a predic-
tive model. Comparison of modeled average intensity
to measurements from independent embalmings sug-
gested the model overestimated exposure by 35%, and
peak exposures could not be validated (Hauptmann
et al., 2009).
Despite the paucity of exposure information, in
two of the largest cohorts evaluated (the NCI indus-
trial worker and embalmer cohorts), several exposure
metrics were estimated (e.g., peak exposure, average

exposure, cumulative exposure, exposure duration).
Owing to the importance that peak exposures play in
the interpretation of the NCI studies, it is important to
note that peaks were not actually measured, but only
inferred from job descriptions. Detailed analyses of
exposure metrics used for the NCI industrial worker
cohort were conducted by Blair et al. (1990) and Stewart
et al. (1986). They reported that measures of duration
(employment and exposure) and average exposure
and level of exposure were highly correlated (r = .8).
Peak exposures had low to moderate correlations with
employment duration (r = .2), exposure duration (r = .3),
cumulative exposure (r = .3), average exposure (r = .5),
and level of exposure (r = .7). Average exposure showed
little correlation with duration of employment (r = −.1)
and duration of exposure (r = .0). Based on these cor-
relations, it is unclear why lymphohematopoietic and
leukemia mortality rates were associated with peak
exposure but not with the number of peak exposures
≥4.0 ppm, cumulative exposure, or exposure duration
(Beane Freeman et al., 2009). Even if higher exposure
intensities are of more consequence as a result of form-
aldehyde’s mode of action, those experiencing higher
air concentrations over time with any repeatability
would have a higher number of peak exposures ≥4.0
ppm and higher cumulative and average exposures, so
these measures ought to show an association as well.
This is not the case, indicating the association with
peak exposure is not likely to be causal (other issues
with this statistic are discussed below).
The lack of precise exposure data likely led to exposure
measurement error and/or exposure misclassification
in these epidemiology studies. This could have biased
results either towards or away from the null (Jurek et al.,
2005). Based on the null associations with other exposure
metrics, in the case of peak exposure, it appears to be the
latter.
4.3.3.  Exposures to other chemicals in the workplace may
have confounded results
None of the studies adequately addressed co-exposures
to other agents. For example, embalmers were exposed
to infectious agents and other chemicals in embalming
fluid, such as methanol, propylene glycol, industrial
methylated spirit, phenol, and glycerol (Coleman and
Kogan, 1998; Bachand et al., 2010; Bosetti et al., 2008;
Collins et  al., 2004). Industrial workers were likely
exposed to other chemicals as well (e.g., antioxidants,
asbestos, benzene, carbon black, dyes and pigments,
hexamethylenetetramine, melamine, phenol, plasti-
cizers, urea, and wood dust) (Beane Freeman et  al.,
2009). Although benzene is the only known leukemogen
among these agents, it is possible that any observed
risks, if found to be real, may have been attributable to
exposures to other agents.
4.3.4.  Exposure-response associations within and among
studies are not consistent
If formaldehyde is in fact a causal factor for leukemia,
one would expect leukemia risk to increase with form-
aldehyde exposure both within and among studies. As
described below, few studies actually assessed exposure-
response (Pinkerton et al., 2004; Stern et al., 1987; Beane
Freeman et  al., 2009; Hauptmann et  al., 2009); among
those, consistent associations were not reported. Among
studies, leukemia risks appeared to be higher in profes-
sionals with lower average formaldehyde exposures
(mean TWA8 concentrations <0.5 to 1 ppm in profes-
sional settings [e.g., workplaces of histopathologists,
embalmers, anatomists]; IARC, 2006), yet more highly
exposed industrial workers (mean TWA8 concentrations
<1 to >10 ppm in industrial settings [e.g., formaldehyde
manufacturing]; IARC, 2006) showed lesser effects, add-
ing to the weight of evidence suggesting formaldehyde is
not a causal factor.
In analyses of formaldehyde and risks of all leukemias
combined, Pinkerton et  al. (2004) found no exposure-
response associations with duration of exposure, time
since first exposure, or year of first exposure in garment
workers. Stern et  al. (1987) also found no trend with
duration of exposure. There were some statistically sig-
nificant trends reported in the NCI industrial cohort but,

as described below, these findings were not robust or
indicative of causation.
In the NCI industrial worker cohort, study subjects
were divided into “low” (>0 to <2.0 ppm), “medium” (2.0
to <4.0), and “high” (≥4.0) exposure categories for the
inferred lifetime peak level, and analyses were conducted
by comparing risks in the medium- and high-exposure
categories to those in the low-exposure category. As
shown in Figure 1, these analyses showed no statistically
significant associations and no exposure-response rela-
tionship with leukemia. If, however, a “zero” category was
added, comprised of workers from the facilities that were
presumably unexposed, the exposure-response trend for
leukemia vs. “peak” became statistically significant, as
was the contrast between the high vs. the zero (but not
vs. the low) category.
Even though the “low” group included people down
to zero as the lifetime “peak” exposure, the leukemia risk
for the “zero” group was markedly lower. People classi-
fied as “zero” must have had systematically different job
descriptions than those in the “low” category (for which
peak exposure could be as low as zero and still admit
them into the “low” group), so the comparability of
these groups is in question. Moreover, the “zero” group
has leukemia risks that are notably smaller than the gen-
eral population. Indeed, when analyses were done on an
SMR basis, risks, although not statistically ­significant,
were much lower than those for the US population

Freeman et al., 2009). In contrast, among the all of the
exposed groups, the SMR estimates are more consis-
tent with US expected levels (SMRall leukemia

CI: 0.85–1.22; SMRlymphatic leukemia
 = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.83–1.59;
SMRmyeloid ­leukemia
 = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.67–1.21) (Beane
Freeman et al., 2009).
In short, it appears that the reported significant rela-
tion of “peak” formaldehyde exposure and leukemia
risk depended entirely on a lower-than-usual leukemia
rate in the “zero” group rather than any effects among
exposedpeople.“Peaks”wereinferredpossibilitiesrather
than actual exposures, and they did not account for the
duration of time spent in the highest peak-exposure cat-
egory or the relevant latent period between the date of
first highest peak exposure and death (Marsh and Youk,
2004). Individuals with high peak exposures early but not
later in their career and those with low peak exposures
for the majority of their career but high peaks near the
end were likely in the same exposure category. Similarly,
those with one peak exposure were likely classified in the
same category as those with several peak exposures. In
both of these scenarios, individuals with very different
exposures were grouped in similar categories. In con-
trast, when grouping workers by the inferred number
of peaks ≥4.0, or by cumulative or average exposure,
individuals with similar exposures were more likely to
be grouped together. Based on these latter metrics, form-
aldehyde exposure was not associated with leukemia.
Thus, the finding of a significant effect for leukemia in the
industrial cohort with peak exposure (Beane Freeman
et al., 2009), which relies on picking apparently positive
results among several similar analyses demonstrating
inconsistent results, is not a substantive or compelling
finding.
It is notable that in analyses limited to myeloid
leukemia, a different pattern emerges. Neither Beane
Freeman et al. (2009) nor Pinkerton et al. (2004) found
any consistent exposure-response associations among
the NCI industrial worker cohort and garment workers,
respectively, regardless of the exposure metric, whereas
Hauptmann et al. (2009) reported trends in embalmers
based on peak exposure and duration of exposure, but
only when the referent categories (<500 embalmings)

were included in the analyses. No trends were observed
when the referent category was excluded or when expo-
sure was defined as average intensity, cumulative expo-
sure, number of embalmings, or 8-hour TWA intensity.
Again, this lack of consistency suggests that observed
trends are not likely indicative of causation.
Regarding other lymphohematopoietic cancer types
or groups, Beane Freeman et al. (2009) observed a trend
only with peak exposure and all lymphohematopoietic
cancers combined in the NCI industrial cohort. No other
trends with all lymphohematopoietic cancers combined
were observed in this cohort or the NCI embalmers cohort
(Hauptmann et  al., 2009). No trends were observed in
either cohort for cancers of lymphoid origin and, for can-
cers of non-lymphoid origin, trends were only observed for
duration of exposure in the NCI embalmers cohort when
unexposed individuals were excluded (which left two indi-
viduals in the lowest category). There were no trends in the
NCI industrial workers cohort with lymphatic leukemia,
and no trends at all for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma or multi-
plemyeloma.BeaneFreemanet al.(2009)observedatrend
with peak exposure and average intensity for Hodgkin’s
lymphoma but not with cumulative exposure, cumulative
number of peaks ≥4.0 ppm, or duration of employment.
Regarding exposure-response among studies,
professionals—such as embalmers, pathologists, and
anatomists—have much lower formaldehyde exposures
than industrial workers. Yet Blair et  al. (1990) found
small excess leukemia risks among professionals but not
industrial workers; several meta-analyses have reported
similar findings (Bosetti et al., 2008; Collins and Lineker,
2004). Some possible explanations have been put forth to
explain these findings, including infectious agents, other
chemicals in embalming fluid, occupational and lifestyle
factors, observer bias, and a higher degree of scrutiny
and medical attention owing to perceived risks (Coleman
and Kogan, 1998; Bachand et  al., 2010; Bosetti et  al.,
2008; Collins et al., 2004). Zhang et al. (2010a) suggest
that effects in industrial workers may not be observed
because analyses were conducted based on combined
exposure categories, but this does not explain why effects
are observed in professionals and not in industrial work-
ers (who have higher exposures), and results from the few
large studies that examined exposure-response associa-
tions do not support the hypothesis that formaldehyde is
causally associated with leukemia.
Overall, although some statistically significant trends
have been noted, these trends were not found consis-
tently within or among studies. The lack of consistent
exposure-response associations within or among studies
indicates that the few associations noted between form-
aldehyde and leukemia are not causal.
4.3.5. Statistical limitations may have led to spurious
associations
When the same set of data is analyzed in multiple par-
allel ways using different models, groupings, or sum-
mary measures, the meaning of statistical tests becomes
distorted by the multiple-comparisons problem. That
is, if enough alternatives are tried, some might be “sig-
nificant” by chance alone (since, at a criterion of p = .05,
even when there is no effect, 5% of comparisons are ruled
“significant”).
Data from several studies, including those of the NCI
industrial worker and embalmer cohorts, were analyzed
many different parallel ways (e.g., average or cumulative
or peak exposure; pairwise comparisons or trends; using
internal or external controls; with or without a “unex-
posed” group in the trend test; individual tumor types or
various measures of combined tumors). Unless a correc-
tion for multiple comparisons is made, finding marginal
significance in one or a few such comparisons is not sur-
prising even when there is no true effect. For example,
in the NCI industrial worker cohort, associations were
reported with peak exposures, but there was no a priori
reason to focus on peak exposures. Furthermore, asso-
ciations were not found for other, more accurate indica-
tors of exposure, such as the number of peak exposures
≥4.0 ppm, cumulative exposure, and average exposure. If
there is no a priori reason to choose a superior exposure
metric, one should not select a model based solely on
statistical performance because choosing the metric with
the strongest association with outcome could lead to bias
(Kriebel et al., 2007). Instead, one should choose a model
based on which is most consistent with the hypothesized
mechanism of action. In the case of formaldehyde, peak
exposure is clearly an inferior metric (discussed above),
and this provides an even stronger argument for not
choosing a model based on the strongest statistical asso-
ciation. The result for peaks can at most be a hypothe-
sis-generating observation to be tested on future data.
Otherwise, it is post hoc and arbitrary.
4.3.6.  The latency argument proposed by Beane Freeman
et al. (2009) appears to be a post hoc explanation for the
observed effects
Epidemiology studies are often limited in that they are
not conducted over long enough periods of time for can-
cer from particular exposures to develop, in which case
causal associations cannot be detected. In the case of leu-
kemia, Beane Freeman et al. (2009) suggest just the oppo-
site, stating that risks for myeloid leukemia may decline
over time owing to a relatively short induction-incubation
period. In other words, they suggest that, after a latent
period during which risks are not increased, increased
risks for leukemia will be observed within a certain time
period and plateau afterwards. Because of this, they sug-
gest that risks may diminish or not be observed if a study
has too long a follow-up period. This appears to be a post
hoc explanation for the diminished risks associated with
peak exposure observed in the NCI industrial worker
cohort with follow-up through 2004 vs. 1994 (in workers
who died 16–25 years after the first exposure). It does not
explain how risks were only observed with peak exposure,
andnotwithotherexposuremetrics(particularlycumula-
tive number of peaks ≥4.0 ppm), or how this trend was not

observedintheNCIembalmerscohort(Hauptmannet al.,
2003; Walrath and Fraumeni, 1984) or garment workers
cohort (Pinkerton et al., 2004), in which risks were only
observed with exposures ≥20 years. Also, Beane Freeman
et al. (2009) did not test this hypothesis even though they
had the data to do so. For all of these reasons, a shorter
latency is not a scientifically valid explanation for the lack
of observed risks by Beane Freeman et al. (2009).
4.3.7.  Recent formaldehyde meta-analyses do not support an
association between formaldehyde exposure and leukemia
A number of recent meta-analyses have been conducted
on the body of epidemiology studies concerning form-
aldehyde and leukemia (Bachand et  al., 2009; Zhang
et al., 2009; Bosetti et al., 2008; Collins and Lineker, 2004;
Schwilk et al., 2010). Only the most recent of these analy-
ses (Bachand et al., 2009; Schwilk et al., 2010) include the
most recent update to the NCI industrial worker cohort;
the others rely on the Hauptmann et al. (2003) analysis, in
which 1006 deaths were omitted unintentionally. Of the
five meta-analyses, three reported no overall association
between formaldehyde and leukemia (Bachand et  al.,
2009; Bosetti et al., 2008; Collins and Lineker, 2004), and
methodological limitations of the other two meta-anal-
yses (Zhang et al., 2009; Schwilk et al., 2010), which are
almost the same except for the addition of two studies in
the latter, make it challenging to interpret their summary
risk estimates (REs).
Bachand et al. (2009) found that, among cohort stud-
ies, REs for exposed vs. unexposed ranged from 0.43 to
1.60 for leukemia—none were statistically significant
(i.e., no 95% CI excluded 1.0)—and the summary risk
estimate indicated no association (RE = 1.05, 95% CI:
0.91–1.20). Data from only two case-control studies were
analyzed, neither of which reported increased risks (Blair
et al. [2001]: RE = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.70–1.36; Partanen et al.

[1993]:RE = 1.40,95%CI:0.25–7.91).Noassociationswere
observed when analyses were stratified by leukemia type
(myeloid,lymphatic/lymphocytic,orother/unspecified),
job type (professional/technical or industrial), or region
(USA/Canada or Europe).
Bosetti et  al. (2008) calculated REs for lymphohe-
matopoietic cancers and leukemia among profession-
als and industrial workers evaluated in cohort studies
published through February 2007. Risks of lymphohe-
matopoietic cancers among professionals were increased
(RE = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.16–1.48), but they were decreased
among industrial workers (RE = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74–0.96).
Similarly, leukemia risks were elevated among profes-
sionals (RE = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.15–1.68), but not industrial
workers (RE = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.75–1.07). Based on analy-
ses of 18 studies published through December 1, 2003,
Collins and Lineker (2004) found similar results. They
reported that leukemia risks were not increased among
industrial workers (RE = 0.9, 95% CI: 0.8–1.0) or patholo-
gists and anatomists (RE = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0–1.9), but were
increased among embalmers (RE = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2–2.0),
who had among the lowest exposures.
In contrast to the three meta-analyses discussed
above, Zhang et  al. (2009) found a significant effect
across industries (RE = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.18–2.00). This
can be explained by the unusual means of selecting
and combining studies: they used different measures
of exposure, selecting only one from each study even
if several were examined, resulting in selection of peak
exposure for studies where available, then average expo-
sure and cumulative exposure for others, and, finally,
exposure duration if none of the other metrics were ana-
lyzed. Zhang et al. (2009) claim this is because average
and cumulative exposure may be less accurate measures
of true exposure if workers with very high exposure also
have long intervening periods with little or no exposure,
but they have not considered whether these metrics are
relevant for assessing risk. Moreover, if several catego-
ries or levels of exposure were examined, Zhang et al.
(2009) took data from only the highest among them.
What constituted a “high” category also varied consid-
erably among studies, depending on how each study
established gradations of exposure. As a consequence,
the comparisons across studies are very heterogeneous,
and it is not clear whether a comparable question was
being examined in each case. Furthermore, by not using
the entire range of exposure estimates (i.e., by examining
risks in the high-exposure group vs. the low-exposure
group only), exposure-response could not be assessed,
which likely generated misleading results, since a lack of
exposure-response can indicate a lack of a causal asso-
ciation. Finally, Zhang et al. (2009) did not use the most
recent NCI industrial worker cohort data, instead relying
on data from the Hauptmann et al. (2003) study, which
didn’t account for over 1000 deaths in the cohort and
only reported increased risks of myeloid leukemia based
on internal comparisons that depended on the reference
category and category cut points.
Schwilk et al. (2010) updated the Zhang et al. (2009)
analysis by including the most recent NCI industrial
worker and embalmer cohort studies (Hauptmann
et al., 2009; Beane Freeman et al., 2009) and reported
increased risks of leukemia (RR = 1.53, 95% CI:
1.11–2.21) and myeloid leukemia (RR = 2.47, 95% CI:
1.42–2.47). Because Schwilk et  al. (2010) use similar
methods as Zhang et  al. (2009), their study suffers
from the same limitations. In addition, Schwilk et  al.
(2010) use one-sided p values, which increased the
likelihood of false-positive results. They also reported
several exposure-response relationships in six stud-
ies and concluded an exposure-response association
exists, but they did not discuss these associations for all
exposure metrics from each study. As we have shown,
had they done this, it would be evident that there are
no consistent exposure-response associations between
formaldehyde exposure and leukemia. Because of all
these limitations, the results of the Zhang et al. (2009)
and Schwilk et al. (2010) analyses should be interpreted
with caution, especially in view of the substantial het-
erogeneity and their lack of concordance with other
meta-analyses.
Overall, results from the meta-analyses of form-
aldehyde and leukemia are consistent with a lack of
association and the results of our weight-of-evidence
evaluation.
4.4.  Summary
As a whole, the available formaldehyde epidemiology
studies do not support a causal association between
formaldehyde exposure and leukemia. As demon-
strated in the endpoint-by-endpoint analysis and
Tables 4 to 13, there is no lymphohematopoietic cancer
or group of lymphohematopoietic cancers for which
associations with formaldehyde were found consis-
tently within or across studies. Although some statisti-
cally significant associations were reported, these were
outnumbered by null findings in the more robust stud-
ies using related exposure metrics, and there were no
consistent exposure-response relationships observed.
Limitations in exposure and cancer outcome assess-
ments as well as statistical analyses also likely affected
calculations of risk.
If formaldehyde were truly a causal factor for leuke-
mia, consistent observations of effect should have been
observed, with increased risks found with increased
exposures. Because this is not the case, it is most likely
that any observed effects were a result of confounders,
limitations in statistical methods (e.g., multiple com-
parisons), disease misclassification, and/or exposure
misclassification/measurement error.
This question can be further explored by consider-
ing information on toxicology and mode-of-action
studies. It is a precept of the HBWoE approach that one
considers the cross-discipline integration of hypoth-
esized effects. To the degree that consideration of
animal data and dosimetry casts doubt on the ability
Formaldehyde as a leukemogen—Weight of evidence  593
© 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.
of inhaled formaldehyde to interact with and perturb
hematopoiesis, this increases the relative plausibility
of a conclusion that those associations seen in purely
epidemiologic investigations are not in fact causal but
are the result of chance, co-exposures, or confound-
ing, compared to an analysis that relies solely on the
observed patterns seen among the epidemiology stud-
ies themselves. Moreover, if the dependence of effect on
peak formaldehyde exposures that has been suggested
in some epidemiology studies is indeed important in
understanding the patterns among human studies,
this dependence ought to be reflected in information
about dosimetry and hypothesized modes of action.
Conversely, if hypothesized modes of action, if operat-
ing, would not be expected to produce a dependence
on peak exposures, then the role of peaks in explaining
positive and null results among human studies is weak-
ened. These issues will be discussed further below.
5.  Weight of evidence regarding
hematotoxicity from formaldehyde exposure
In the following analysis, we examine a potential asso-
ciation between formaldehyde exposure and leukemia
in animals and hematotoxicity as reflected by changes in
peripheral blood hematology in both humans and ani-
mals. We conducted a literature search, using PubMed,
for all human studies measuring or estimating formal-
dehyde exposure and the changes in peripheral blood
hematology,inadditiontoallshort-andlong-termanimal
studies that investigated either potential formaldehyde-
associated leukemogenicity or hematology changes in
peripheral blood. Search terms included “hematology,”
“hematotoxicity,” “leukemia,” “lymphoma,” “lymphohe-
matopoietic,” “formaldehyde,” “rat,” “mouse,” “rodent,”
“human,” and “occupational.” We also relied on refer-
ences within the papers that we found in the PubMed
search and on non-peer-reviewed analyses of animal
studies, which are part of the current debate on potential
formaldehyde leukemogenicity.
Hematotoxicity may be defined as an insult that can
be identified in blood and blood components. This tox-
icity is reflected in the production or loss of blood com-
ponents, including red blood cells (RBCs, erythrocytes),
white blood cells (WBCs, leukocytes), platelets, and
hemoglobin (Hb) (found in RBCs), responsible for car-
rying oxygen. Hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs)
in bone marrow give rise to RBCs and WBC subtypes—
neutrophils, lymphocytes (B and T types), monocytes,
eosinophils, basophils, and megakaryocytes, from
which platelets are derived (Cotran et al., 1999). There
are three main types of myeloid progenitor cells that
undergo several stages of differentiation to give rise to
the blood cells (e.g., granulocyte-macrophage colony-
forming unit [CFU-GM] gives rise to granulocytes and
macrophages) (Cotran et al., 1999). Blood-forming cells
normally leave the bone marrow only when fully dif-
ferentiated, but a small number of progenitor cells can
leave the bone marrow and circulate in blood (Aster
and Kumar, 1999).
A decline in peripheral blood of one or more WBC
type counts can result in leukopenia, that of RBCs, ane-
mia, and when all cell types in peripheral blood decline,
pancytopenia. When the oxygen-carrying capacity of
RBCs is compromised, new RBCs can be manufactured
at a faster-than-usual rate, which may result in larger
mean RBC size (mean corpuscular volume, MCV).
Numerous factors can influence changes in blood com-
ponents. These include, but are not limited to, certain
infections, nutrient imbalance, xenobiotic insults to
either blood components directly or to the bone mar-
row progenitor cells, alcohol intake, smoking, exces-
sive bleeding, menstruation, and certain medications
(Mayo Clinic, 2008). Leukemogenesis may be viewed as
a multistage process that involves interruption of the
normal cellular differentiation process in the bone mar-
row and accumulation of the undifferentiated cells in
bone marrow, a condition that crowds and suppresses
the remaining normal hematopoietic progenitor cells.
This suppression of normal hematopoiesis can result
in anemia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. Eventually,
the undifferentiated, and abnormally functional, cells
in bone marrow spill into peripheral blood and become
the predominant cells there (Irons and Stillman, 1996;
Aster and Kumar, 1999). As discussed in Section 5.3.3
below, most known leukemogens can cause pancy-
topenia (a decline in all cell types in peripheral blood)
that is secondary to bone marrow toxicity. In addition
to pancytopenia, bone marrow toxicity has been asso-
ciated with decreased counts or viability of circulating
blood cells, including progenitor cells (Dempster and
Snyder, 1991; Toft et al., 1982, both as cited in ATSDR
2007).
5.1.  Formaldehyde hematotoxicity in animals
5.1.1.  Hematology
Several animal studies have assessed the hematotoxic
potential of formaldehyde via both oral and inhalation
routes. As shown in Table 14, these studies ranged from
subacute to chronic in duration (4 weeks to 24 months)
and used a wide range of exposure concentrations; the
highest was 5000 ppm in drinking water (Tobe et  al.,
1989) and 20 ppm in air (Woutersen et al., 1987).
As shown in Table 14, the results from the inhala-
tion studies generally show that formaldehyde does not
induce changes in standard hematology parameters in
peripheral blood. One study (Dean et al., 1984) showed a
significant (p < .05) decrease in monocytes, but not other
leukocytes, in the blood of B6C3F1 mice after 3 weeks
of exposure to 15 ppm formaldehyde, but no exposure-
related changes in either bone marrow cellularity or CFU
progenitor cell counts. In contrast, a longer-term study
by Kerns et al. (1983) in the same mouse strain found no
changes in hematology.
The results of the ingestion exposure studies are
generally not indicative of a hematotoxic effect of
594  L. R. Rhomberg et al.

formaldehyde. For example, the studies by Appelman
et  al. (1988), Johannsen et  al. (1986), and Til et  al.
(1988, 1989) did not find any changes in hematology
with exposure. Tobe et al. (1989) reported statistically
significant lowered RBC counts and Hb concentrations,
but these changes were not exposure-concentration
dependent. The results by Tobe et  al. (1989) were
contradicted by Vargova et  al. (1993), who reported
increased hematocrit (Hct) and Hb concentrations and
RBC counts in blood. Furthermore, statistically signifi-
cant changes in WBC counts following oral exposure to
formaldehyde were found by Vargova et  al. (1993) as
increased monocyte counts and decreased lymphocyte
counts only following exposure to very high doses (as
high as 80 mg/kg for 4 weeks, equivalent to ~800 ppm
in drinking water).
5.1.2. Leukemia
We reviewed eight animal studies investigating the
tumorigenic potential of formaldehyde by inhalation
(Kerns et  al., 1983; Kamata et  al., 1997; Albert et  al.,
1982; Feron et  al., 1988) and ingestion (Tobe et  al.,
1989; Til et  al., 1989; Takahashi et  al., 1986; Soffritti
et al., 1989, 2002). We also considered two unpublished
and non-peer-reviewed analyses (DeVoney et al., 2010,
poster abstract only; Woutersen, 2007) of data from the
Battelle Columbus Laboratories (1981) study that was
later published by Kerns et al. (1983). Animal inhala-
tion studies generally showed significantly increased
rates of nasal tumors (Kerns et al., 1983; Kamata et al.,
1997; Sellakumar et al., 1985) but, as shown in Table 15,
not of leukemias or lymphomas, when these endpoints
were investigated. Ingestion studies showed neither
increased rates of nasal nor hematopoietic malignan-
cies in rats. We have limited our review to analyzing
potential formaldehyde-associated changes in leuke-
mia and lymphoma rates in the exposed animals. Table
15 describes the animal species, exposure characteris-
tics, and hematopoietic malignancy outcomes of the
studies discussed in this section.
Battelle Columbus Laboratories (1981) exposed
Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice via inhalation to
formaldehyde for 2 years. As shown in Table 15, tumor
incidence data from Battelle Columbus Laboratories
(1981) were analyzed by Kerns et  al. (1983), DeVoney
et al. (2010 poster abstract), and Woutersen (2007) but
with different outcomes. Whereas DeVoney et al. (2010
poster abstract) reported elevated lymphoma incidence
in female B6C3F1 mice and elevated leukemia incidence
in female Fischer 344 rats, Woutersen’s analysis found
increased lymphoma incidence only in female mice,
immediately after exposure, although this trend showed
no statistically significant association for formaldehyde
when the 3-month period following exposure was con-
sidered (Woutersen, 2007). Kerns et al. (1983) reported
no formaldehyde-associated elevated rates of leukemia
or lymphoma in this study in either rats or mice. It is
noteworthy that the leukemias found in Fischer 344 rats
by Battelle Columbus Laboratories (1981) likely included
mononuclear cell leukemias (MCLs), which are usually
observed in ~50% and ~28% of unexposed male and
female Fischer 344 rats, respectively (Haseman et  al.,
1998). This high background incidence of MCLs in rats
brings into question the outcomes and resulting conclu-
sions of these non-peer-reviewed results by DeVoney
et al. (2006 poster, 2010 poster abstract). Furthermore, as
discussed by Ishmael and Dugard (2006), any MCL coun-
terpart in humans is rare, MCLs are more likely elevated
by chemical exposure in Fischer rats but not in Osborne
Mendel or Sprague Dawley rats, and MCL incidence can
be reduced by type of chemical delivery vehicle, such
as corn oil, all which suggest that any positive findings
involving MCL incidence in animals may not be relevant
in humans.
Four studies, all of which used rats, assessed the tum-
origenicity of formaldehyde from drinking water. The
exposure concentrations were as high as 5000 ppm in
water. Exposure durations were either 2 years (Soffritti
et al., 1989, 2002; Til et al., 1989; Tobe et al., 1989) or 32
weeks preceded by 8 weeks of treatment with a tumor
initiator, N-methyl-N’-nitrosoguanidine (Takahashi
et al., 1986). Of these studies, only Soffritti et al. (1989,
2002) reported statistically significantly increased
hematopoietic malignancies (i.e., lymphomas and
leukemias).
Soffritti et  al. (1989) performed two experiments.
In the first experiment, the authors exposed male and
female Sprague Dawley rats to 0, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000,
or 1500 ppm of formaldehyde in drinking water for 2
years. The authors reported an increase in leukemia
incidence at concentrations above 50 ppm (specifically,
lymphoblastic leukemias and lymphosarcomas, immu-
noblastic lymphosarcomas, and “other leukemias,”
although the anatomic location of these neoplasms
was not indicated). The increase, particularly in immu-
noblastic lymphosarcomas, was not exposure related,
however. Moreover, the lack of statistical analysis of the
data in this report does not allow a full assessment of
cause and effect. In the second experiment, the authors
exposed male and female Sprague-Dawley breeder rats
and their male and female offspring to regular drinking
water and drinking water containing 2500 ppm form-
aldehyde. The authors reported increased leukemia
rates (specifically immunoblastic lymphosarcomas
and “other leukemias”) for each of the male and female
breeder groups and the male offspring group, but
there was no incidence in the female offspring group.
The lack of statistical analysis for this experiment also
precludes proper data assessment. In their subsequent
report of this same study, Soffritti et al. (2002) presented
the results from only the first experiment mentioned
above, but these results differed from the earlier report
by Soffritti et al. (1989). The authors neither explained
why they included only one experiment in this report
nor addressed the differences in reported outcomes
between reports.

5.2.  Formaldehyde hematotoxicity in humans
There are limited, mostly occupational, studies in
humans of the hematotoxic effects of exposure to form-
aldehyde. Tang et al. (2009) recently abstracted data from
eight studies conducted in China that assessed WBC and
platelet counts and Hb concentration in subjects occupa-
tionally exposed to formaldehyde (Yang et al., 2007; Kuo
et al., 1997; Cheng et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2007; Qian et al.,
1988; Feng et al., 1996; Tang et al., 2003; Tong et al., 2007,
all as cited by Tang et al., 2009). The findings by Kuo et al.
(1997), the only study of hematological effects cited by
Tang et al. (2009) available in English, are associated with
several uncertainties that weaken the conclusions drawn
by Tang et al. (2009) about these effects. Many questions
arise about the outcomes and exposure-related uncer-
tainties in the findings of the other, untranslated, studies
cited by Tang et al. (2009) (Section 5.3.2 provides further
discussion of this point). We found four other studies
that assessed hematological parameters associated with
formaldehyde exposure (Ye et  al., 2005; Lyapina et  al.,
2004; Srivastava et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 2010b). Table 16
describes the exposure characteristics and hematology
outcomes, as available, of the studies discussed in this
section.
In the China-based hematotoxicity studies reported
in Tang et al. (2009), the leukocyte counts in the exposed
subjects were generally lower than in the control sub-
jects, but differences were statistically significant in only
four (Yang et  al., 2007; Cheng et  al., 2004; Qian et  al.,
1988; Tong et al., 2007, all as cited by Tang et al., 2009) of
the eight studies. Feng et al. (1996, as cited by Tang et al.,
2009), Xu et al. (2007, as cited by Tang et al., 2009), and
Tang et al. (2003, as cited by Tang et al., 2009) did not find
statistically significant differences in leukocyte counts
related to formaldehyde exposure. Several studies found
an inverse correlation between duration of exposure to
formaldehyde and leukocyte counts (Tong et  al., 2007;
Yang et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2003; Kuo et al., 1997, all as
cited by Tang et al., 2009), but the relationship was only
reported as statistically significant in the study by Kuo
et al. (1997, as cited by Tang et al., 2009).
Ye et al. (2005) assessed lymphocyte subset counts in
peripheral blood in student controls (living in dorms),
factory workers (8.6 years mean duration of exposure),
and ballroom waiters (12 week exposure duration), all
non-smokers. The formaldehyde concentration was
0.8 ppm in the factory, 0.09 ppm in the ballroom, and
0.009 ppm in the dorms. As shown in Table 16, differ-
ences in percentage of lymphocyte subset counts among
groupswerelimitedtostatisticallysignificantlyincreased
B lymphocytes, and decreased CD3 (total T cells) and
CD8 (T-cytotoxic), but not CD4 (T-helper-inducer), T
lymphocytes, in the workers as compared with the stu-
dents. The change in CD3 cells (~5% decrease) appeared
to be driven by CD8 cells (~25% decrease). It is not
apparent why CD3 and CD8 cells decrease, but not CD4.
Since total T cells were decreased, however, it is possible
that there was no need for the helper T cells (CD4) and
therefore no change was observed relative to controls.
Nevertheless, this is an interesting finding by Ye et  al.
(2005) and warrants further investigation of lympho-
cyte subset dynamics. Further, since this study shows
statistically significant changes in both B- and T-cell
populations, it is likely that any effect attributed to form-
aldehyde exposure is immune and acquired and did not
originate from an insult to the bone marrow. It would
be interesting to know the counts in peripheral blood of
RBCs and WBCs, other than lymphocytes, to shed light
on potential bone marrow involvement, but these data
were not available for this study.
Lyapina et al. (2004) found no significant differences
in standard hematology tests of workers applying form-
aldehyde-carbamide glue when compared with those
from subjects with no known appreciable formaldehyde
exposure (formaldehyde levels not reported for either
group). The authors reported a statistically significant
inverse relationship, however, between the duration of
occupational exposure to formaldehyde and RBC count,
but there was no relationship with WBC count. Similarly,
Srivastava et  al. (1992) found decreased Hb concen-
trations in the blood of three of six workers who were
involved in producing and preparing melamine-formal-
dehyde resin. However, it is not readily apparent whether
the differences in RBC count and hemoglobin are related
to formaldehyde exposure since this study included a
limited number of subjects. In addition, this study found
increased total lymphocytes (>3200 per mm3
of blood) in
three of six workers. The authors of this study indicated
that the subjects were exposed to relatively high levels of
formaldehyde at different times during the day.
Recently, Zhang et al. (2010b) investigated the asso-
ciations between formaldehyde exposure and various
hematology parameters in subjects working with formal-
dehyde-melamineresinintwofactoriesinChina(median,
1.28 ppm formaldehyde) as compared with volunteer
subjects from three other factories with lower formalde-
hyde levels (median, 0.026 ppm). Formaldehyde can dis-
sociate from the melamine resin, become airborne, and
be inhaled by the factory workers. The workers were pos-
sibly also exposed to formaldehyde dermally, and sub-
ject to potential formaldehyde-induced skin reactions, if
they touched the resin with their bare skin. The authors
assessed personal workplace exposures to formaldehyde
in air on 3 days for a full shift (>6 hour/shift) and to other
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including benzene,
on two or three occasions within a 3-week period. The
authors matched exposed and control subjects by age
and sex; however, there were considerably different rates
of current alcohol drinkers (yes/no answer) and recent
respiratory infections (yes/no answer) in the exposed as
compared with the control subjects (26% vs. 41% and 40%
vs. 29%, respectively). Alcohol intake and recent respira-
tory infections can influence WBC counts. As shown in
Table 16, Zhang et al. (2010b) report statistically signifi-
cant lower counts of total WBCs, lymphocytes, granulo-
cytes, platelets, and RBCs in addition to a higher MCV,
596  L. R. Rhomberg et al.

but not monocytes or Hb concentration in exposed sub-
jects relative to controls. In addition, the authors found
no statistically significant difference in the growth of cir-
culating CFU-GM hematopoietic progenitor cells ex vivo
between exposed and control subjects.
In the following section, we weigh the evidence from
human and animal studies discussed in Sections 5.1
and 5.2 to assess the likelihood of a hematotoxic role for
formaldehyde.
5.3. HBWoE evaluation of formaldehyde
hematotoxicity studies
Based on the available data summarized above, some
have hypothesized that formaldehyde may cause hema-
totoxicity and leukemia in humans. We ask the following
questions with regard to this hypothesis:
Do animal studies suggest formaldehyde exposure is1.	
causally associated with hematotoxicity and leukemia?
What do the human studies tell us about potential2.	
formaldehyde hematotoxicity in humans? Are the
results of human studies consistent with those of
animal studies?
What is known about the hematotoxicity of known3.	
leukemogens (e.g., benzene) from animal and
human studies and how does that compare to
formaldehyde?
AretherealternativeexplanationsfordecreasedWBC4.	
and RBC counts?
 As a whole, considering these questions allows for an
assessment of the extent to which the hematotoxicity and
animal leukemia data support either a causal association
between formaldehyde exposure and leukemia or an
alternative hypothesis. Importantly, one needs to con-
sider the hematotoxicity and animal leukemia data in the
context of the epidemiology and mode-of-action data, as
each of the three lines of evidence inform interpretation
of each other.

5.3.1.  Key animal studies do not provide strong evidence
of an association between formaldehyde exposure and
hematotoxicity and leukemia
5.3.1.1. Hematology  Known leukemogens, such as ben-
zene, can cause bone marrow toxicity, which affects the
ability of bone marrow cells to produce blood-forming
cells (ATSDR, 2007). As discussed in the introduction
to this section, this toxicity can be manifested in bone
marrow suppression and pancytopenia, a generalized
decrease of blood cellular components. This insult to
bone marrow may progress to a malignancy that shows a
predominance in production of one or more cell types in
bone marrow that spill into peripheral blood.
Weexaminedtheavailableformaldehydeanimalstud-
ies for signs of hematotoxicity as reflected in peripheral
blood. Of 12 studies we reviewed, 9 reported no change
in hematology parameters (see Table 14). These studies,
which ranged from exposures lasting a few weeks to lon-
ger than 2 years, spanned a range of concentrations and
durations that would be sufficient to show any changes
in hematology.
Three studies reported a change in one or more hema-
tology parameter: Dean et al. (1984) by inhalation, and
Tobe et al. (1989) and Vargova et al. (1993) by oral expo-
sure. However, these outcomes were mixed. For example,
Dean et al. (1984) reported a decrease in monocytes but
no other hematology parameter, whereas Vargova et al.
(1993) reported an increase in monocytes but a decrease
in lymphocyte counts. Vargova et  al. (1993) also found
increased Hct, Hb concentration, and RBC counts in
blood, in contrast to results from Tobe et al. (1989), which
indicated decreased Hb concentrations and RBC counts.
It is noteworthy that the changes in the aforementioned
studies resulted from very high exposures, particularly in
oral exposure studies, ranging from 40 to 300 mg/kg body
weight/day (approximately 800–5000 ppm in drinking
water), as noted in Table 14.
Overall, the hematological ingestion and inhalation
studiesofformaldehydewereviewedareinconsistentand
eclipsed by overwhelming evidence from the same and
other species of animals that show no change in hematol-
ogy parameters. When found, the statistically significant
changes are likely not related to formaldehyde exposure,
particularly because they arise among many other statis-
tically insignificant associations. Further, if bone marrow
toxicity had occurred, it is likely that declines in more
than one blood cell type would have been observed, such
as is established for benzene (discussed in Section 5.3.3),
and that was not reported by the authors of any of the
studies we reviewed.
5.3.1.2. Leukemia  We also analyzed the outcomes of
animal studies that examined the carcinogenicity of
formaldehyde by inhalation or ingestion. The major-
ity of these studies, listed in Table 15 and discussed in
Section 5.1, found no excess hematopoietic malignan-
cies associated with formaldehyde exposure (Albert
et  al., 1982; Kerns et  al., 1983; Sellakumar et  al., 1985;
Kamata et  al., 1997; Feron et  al., 1988; Til et  al., 1989;
Tobe et  al., 1989; Takahashi et  al., 1986). However, the
studies by Soffritti et  al. (1989, 2002), the unpublished
data from the DeVoney et al. (2010 poster abstract), and
Woutersen’s (2007 presentation) analyses of data from
Battelle Columbus Laboratories (1981) found increased
incidence of hematopoietic malignances from formalde-
hyde ingestion and inhalation, respectively.
Soffritti et  al. (1989) performed two carcinogenicity
experiments by ingestion and reported statistically sig-
nificantly increased hematopoietic malignancies in two
reports (Soffritti et al., 1989, 2002) described in Section
5.1 and Table 15, the results of which are inconsistent
and have been criticized by both ATSDR (1999) and the
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA, 2006) as unreli-
able. The lack of confidence in the results by Soffritti
et al. (1989, 2002) stems, in part, from concerns about
the rodent colony where the experiments occurred.
Feron et al. (1990) suggested that the elevated leukemia
incidence might have been “unrelated to formaldehyde
ingestion,” because of the wide range of incidence rates
of hematopoietic malignancies in control animals from
the same colony—as high as 19%. Moreover, a possible
infection of the rat colony by Mycoplasma pulmonis (an
organism that preferentially colonizes the respiratory
tract in rats and secretes substances that can promote
mitogenesis in lymphocytes) also has been presented as
a potential confounder for hematolymphopoietic malig-
nancies reported by Soffritti et al. (1989, 2002).
Other studies examining formaldehyde carcinogenic-
ity via the oral route did not indicate an increased inci-
dence of hematopoietic malignancies relative to control
exposures. The longer-term carcinogenicity studies by
both Til et al. (1989) and Tobe et al. (1989) showed no
increase in these malignancies after 2 years of exposure
and follow-up, consistent with Takahashi et  al. (1986)
who only followed animals for 40 weeks.
As reported in conference posters, DeVoney et  al.
(2006 poster, 2010 poster abstract) reevaluated data from
Battelle Columbus Laboratories (1981) and reported
increased lymphoma incidence rates for female B6C3F1
mice exposed to ~15 ppm by inhalation (28% vs. 18%
in exposed vs. control mice, respectively). According
to Haseman et al. (1998), the background rate for lym-
phoma in these female mice, based on 1092 control
mice used in National Toxicology Program (NTP) stud-
ies, is 19.9%, with a range of 6% to 44% in all studies
examined. Therefore, the rates reported by DeVoney
et al. (2006 poster, 2010 poster abstract) fall within back-
ground tumor rates for the rodent species use in Battelle
Columbus Laboratories (1981) and do not provide suf-
ficient evidence for formaldehyde leukemogenicity.
These non-peer-reviewed results by DeVoney et al. (2006
poster, 2010 poster abstract) are contrasted by another
evaluation of Battelle Columbus Laboratories (1981) data
by Woutersen (2007) (as presented at the Formaldehyde
International Science Conference), who found a sta-
tistically significant increased trend in lymphoma for

only female mice among the rodent species and sexes
examined. Moreover, there was no statistically signifi-
cant association with formaldehyde when post-exposure
follow-up data (3-month period) was considered. When
considering the three distinct analyses of the Battelle
Columbus Laboratories (1981) carcinogenicity data,
in addition to the high background tumor rates in the
rodent species examined, it becomes less likely that the

reported inconsistent increased lymphoma incidence is
related to formaldehyde exposure.
The rates presented by DeVoney et  al. (2006 poster,
2010 poster abstract) for hematopoietic malignancies in
female Fischer 344 rats demonstrate no dose-response
for leukemia; the authors found 25%, 23%, and 24%
leukemia incidence in rats exposed to 2, 6, and 15 ppm
formaldehyde vs. 15% in control rats. Similarly, the leu-
kemia rates in both exposed and control rats were either
below or within the range of leukemia incidence in the
controls used in NTP studies, which Haseman et  al.
(1998) lists as 37% (range, 24% to 54%) for leukemia in
female Fischer 344 rats. Noteworthy is that the leukemias
found in Fischer 344 rats likely included MCLs, which
are usually observed in ~50% and ~28% of unexposed
male and female Fischer 344 rats, respectively (Haseman
et  al., 1998). This high background incidence of MCLs
in rats brings into question the validity of the unpub-
lished results by DeVoney et al. (2006 poster; 2010 poster
abstract). Further, as discussed in Section 5.1.2, above,
MCLs are not observed in humans, and findings involv-
ing MCL incidence in animals may not be relevant in
humans.
The results by Soffritti et  al. (1989, 2002) and the
unpublished reanalysis by DeVoney et  al. (2006
poster; 2010 poster abstract) of the Battelle Columbus
Laboratories (1981) data do not provide appreciable
support for formaldehyde-induced leukemia in rodents.
These results are unlikely to indicate formaldehyde
leukemogenicity, particularly when weighed against
the relatively high background rates of hematopoietic
malignancies in the mouse and rat species used in these
studies and the overwhelmingly negative results from
nine other carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice.
Finally, it is not surprising that most studies show no
change in leukemia incidence with formaldehyde expo-
sure since most studies, short- and long-term, showed
no change in hematology parameters, which are impor-
tant precursors in the chain of events for chemically
induced leukemia.
5.3.2.  Key human studies do not provide strong evidence
of an association between formaldehyde exposure and
hematotoxicity
The studies that associate hematology parameters in
humans with formaldehyde exposure are generally
cross-sectional in nature. Cross-sectional environmental
toxicology studies frequently involve concurrent obser-
vation of a biological endpoint and exposure to an envi-
ronmental agent at a single point in time or over a short
time duration. Except for a few studies, no information
was available on either the methods of exposure assess-
ment of formaldehyde or the assessment of potential
confounding effects from known hematotoxicants such
as benzene. For some studies, formaldehyde exposure
information was absent altogether (see Table 16).
We investigated whether a possible exposure-re-
sponse pattern existed between the reported airborne
formaldehyde concentrations and the reported hema-
tology responses in the studies that we reviewed. The
results of studies based in China and cited by Tang et al.
(2009) do not show an exposure-response relationship
between formaldehyde concentrations and hematol-
ogy parameters. For example, the study by Feng et  al.
(1996, as cited by Tang et al., 2009) reportedly showed
no association between very high formaldehyde expo-
sures (range, 0.57–15.61 ppm) and either changes in
WBC counts or Hb concentrations in peripheral blood.
Xu et al. (2007, as cited by Tang et al., 2009) also found
no significant differences in Hb concentrations or WBC
and platelet counts in association with relatively elevated
formaldehyde exposures ranging from 0.36 ppm to 5.56
ppm. In contrast, Qian et al. (1998, as cited by Tang et al.,
2009) estimated formaldehyde exposure to be 2.44 ppm,
and found a statistically significant association between
this concentration and a lower WBC count. In addition,
some studies with lower formaldehyde exposures were
statistically significantly associated with decreased WBC
counts and other hematology parameters. For example,
Cheng et al. (2004, as cited by Tang et al., 2009) found
decreased WBC counts in individuals exposed to form-
aldehyde concentrations ranging from 0.2 ppm to 0.76
ppm, whereas Yang et al. (2007, as cited by Tang et al.,
2009) found similar associations at lower concentrations
not exceeding 0.036 ppm. When examining the hema-
tology outcomes of the studies we reviewed (shown in
Table 16), we found no consistent exposure-dependent
pattern in either qualitative or quantitative changes.
Moreover, using the data presented by Tang et  al.
(2009), we determined the percent change or difference
in total WBC counts between exposure groups when
these counts were available; as shown in Table 16, WBC
counts were between 11% and 19% lower in exposed vs.
control subjects. However, when examining the studies
altogether, we did not find dose dependency in the WBC,
platelet, or Hb associations with formaldehyde exposure
measurements.
SomeoftheChineseoccupationalstudiesthatreported
significantly lower WBC concentrations in exposed sub-
jects also reported formaldehyde concentrations in air
that were lower than those expected outside of work. For
example, the air concentration ranges reported by Zhang
et al. (2010b) (median, 0.026 ppm), by Yang et al. (2007, as
cited by Tang et al., 2009) (0.018–0.036 ppm), and by Kuo
et al. (1997) (ND–0.054 ppm) overlap with concentrations
reported in indoor public places in several Chinese cities
(0.12 ppm [range, 0.02–0.31 ppm] as reported by Tang
et al. [2009] from the Chinese Ministry of Health). These
data suggest that results based on workplace exposure to
formaldehyde may be confounded by non-occupational
exposures, which can be as high or even higher than the
occupational exposures. Appreciable non-occupational
sources of formaldehyde exposure exist, particularly in
China, where most of the human formaldehyde hematol-
ogy studies have been conducted. Formaldehyde con-

up to 0.5 ppm in China (mean, 0.19 ppm) and certain
dietary items have been found to contain several hun-
dreds or even thousands of milligrams of formaldehyde
per kilogram (as reviewed by Tang et  al., 2009). The
authors’ lack of accounting for non-occupational sources
of formaldehyde exposure adds to the uncertainties in
the study outcomes and diminishes their credibility for a
hematotoxic role for formaldehyde.
There are many uncertainties about the Chinese
hematology studies as reported by Tang et  al. (2009).
For example, Tang et  al. (2009) suggest that Kuo et  al.
(1997) shows a statistically significant inverse relation-
ship between formaldehyde concentrations and WBC
counts. Although Kuo et al. (1997), the only study among
those cited by Tang et  al. (2009) available in English,
indeed shows such an association (−.33, p < .05), it does
not show a significant relationship between exposure
measurements and 11 other hematology parameters,
including RBC and individual WBC-type counts. Further,
the authors collected peripheral blood on two occasions
1 year apart and found associations only with the second
but not the first blood sample. Subjects in the Kuo et al.
(1997) study were employed for an average of 3 years at
the study locations; if the association between formal-
dehyde exposure and this lone hematology parameter is
real, then it should have been consistent in both blood
samples collected. When considering the uncertainties
associated with this readily obtainable study (Kuo et al.,
1997), many questions arise about the full outcomes and
exposure-relateduncertaintiesinthefindingsoftheother
studies cited by Tang et al. (2009) (which are unavailable
in English).
The most recent study to assess hematotoxicity in
humans exposed to formaldehyde is Zhang et al. (2010b).
The study provides some associations between formal-
dehyde exposure and changes in hematology, but also
demonstrates serious weaknesses in the study design.
The hematology findings by Zhang et al. (2010b) do not
consistently support a hematotoxic role for formalde-
hyde. For example, the authors found statistically sig-
nificant lower WBC, RBC, and platelet counts in exposed
vs. control factory workers, yet they found no statistically
significant difference between exposed and control sub-
jects in relation to colony formation of myeloid progeni-
tor cells (CFU-GM), which give rise to granulocytes and
macrophages, cultured from blood. If it were possible for
formaldehyde to cause direct or indirect toxicity to bone
marrow, a decreased ability of CFU-GM to grow in cul-
ture would likely be observed, but this did not occur.
It is not clear from the Zhang et  al. (2010b) data
whether all subjects with decreased WBC counts also
had decreased RBC counts and vice versa. If bone
marrow toxicity was indeed in progress in the subjects
exposed to higher levels of formaldehyde, then both
WBC and RBC counts would be lower in the same indi-
viduals. In addition, because the WBC and RBC counts
were pooled, it is impossible to determine if outli-
ers in either group might have influenced the results,
since subject-specific hematology parameters are not
reported. Therefore, one cannot make definitive con-
clusions concerning these data.
We investigated the consistency between the animal
and human study outcomes. As we discuss, animal stud-
ies generally show no evidence of formaldehyde-induced
hematotoxicity. Human studies, on the other hand, show
inconsistent associations between formaldehyde expo-
sure measurements and hematologic parameters. Even
when hematology changes, such as depressed WBC
counts in the blood, are associated with formaldehyde,
these associations are not exposure related, and do not
agree with the findings from animal studies. This lack
of concordance between human and animal studies
does not provide evidence to support an argument for
formaldehyde-induced hematotoxicity, unlike benzene
and other leukemogens that show concordance between
animal and human data (as discussed in Section 5.3.3).
However, the limited number of human studies avail-
able, and the inconsistencies among them, warrants the
need for well-controlled human studies with respect to
exposure assessment and subject-matching between the
exposed and control groups.
The available human hematotoxicity studies are cross-
sectional in nature. In cross-sectional studies, both expo-
sureandoutcomeareevaluatedatthesametime.Amajor
weakness of cross-sectional environmental toxicology
studies is that a chemical measurement at one point of
time may not be indicative of earlier exposures that may
have caused the biological outcome. Also, inappropriate
subject-group matching (e.g., for smoking, drinking, age,
sex) may result in findings of differences in biological
outcomes associated with the agent in question when
there are in fact none. In particular, Zhang et al. (2010b)
only matched subjects by age and sex; however, there
was a considerably higher rate of recent respiratory
infections (yes/no answer) in the exposed vs. control
subjects (40% vs. 29%, respectively). Zhang et al. (2010b)
report that subjects were screened by physicians and
trained questionnaire administrators. However, no list-
ing of medications or medical conditions is available for
the subjects in this study. We discuss possible confound-
ers in the subsequent sections, particularly from dermal
exposure to formaldehyde and respiratory infections that
can possibly modulate the associations in the studies we
reviewed for human formaldehyde hematotoxicity.
5.3.3.  If formaldehyde causes leukemia in humans, it is likely
due to a mechanism that is different from that observed with
known leukemogens
Hematotoxicity has been demonstrated in both animals
and humans exposed to leukemogens (i.e., benzene,
chemotherapeutic alkylating agents, and x-ray and
gamma radiation). This hematotoxicity can be illustrated
with benzene. Benzene has been frequently found to
cause pancytopenia in animals (e.g., Aksoy et al., 1972;
Farris et  al., 1997, both as cited in ATSDR, 2007) and
humans (e.g., Kipen et al., 1989; Schnatter et al., 2010;
Formaldehyde as a leukemogen—Weight of evidence  603
© 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.
ATSDR, 2007). Moreover, numerous studies have shown
that exposure to benzene can cause leukemia and other
hematopoietic malignancies in animals by inhalation
and oral routes in several rodent species of both sexes
(Snyder et al., 1984; Cronkite et al., 1984, 1985, 1989; all
as cited in ATSDR, 2007). Many epidemiology studies
have also shown robust associations between exposure
to benzene and increased risk of leukemia (e.g., Rinsky
et  al., 1987, 2002; Yin et  al., 1996; Infante et  al., 1977;
ATSDR, 2007). The mechanism for benzene hematotox-
icity and leukemogenicity is dependent on its metabo-
lism to reactive intermediates and is well established as
having the ability to affect bone marrow cells directly
(ATSDR, 2007).
Other leukemogens have cytotoxic and genotoxic
properties similar to benzene. These agents can affect
all cells, particularly rapidly dividing cells such as bone
marrow. For example, cyclophosphamide, a chemother-
apeutic alkylating agent, has produced hematopoietic
malignancies in exposed animals (Schmahl and Habs,
1979) as well as leukopenia in humans (Bower et al., 2004;
Tjan-Heijnen et al., 2001) and animals (Wang et al., 2002;
Nohynek et al., 1997). X-ray and gamma-radiation also
have been repeatedly shown to cause leukemia and bone
marrow toxicity in animals and humans (IARC, 2000).
As discussed in the preceding section, the available
human studies lack the appropriate exposure and sub-
ject information and the consistent outcomes to make
a convincing case for formaldehyde leukemogenicity.
Upon reviewing the available studies of formaldehyde
hematology effects, we found no consistent evidence of
hematotoxicity in humans. Moreover, the animal studies
using mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys, often of both sexes,
overwhelmingly reported no evidence of changes in
hematology parameters, as shown in Table 14. Therefore,
if formaldehyde causes leukemia in humans, it must be
by a mechanism that is different from that observed with
known leukemogens and is likely specific to humans and
not common to rodents. Table 17 illustrates the diver-
gence of formaldehyde from known leukemogens in
terms of hematotoxicity indicators.
5.3.4.  There are alternative explanations for the
pancytopenia reported by Zhang et al. (2010b) and the
leukopenia reported by other studies
As reviewed above, animal studies generally do not show
a hematotoxic effect of formaldehyde. However, several
human studies report that formaldehyde is associated
with lowered WBC and RBC counts in peripheral blood
(see Table 16). Our review of available human studies
of formaldehyde hematotoxicity finds that these studies
do not sufficiently explain some of the formaldehyde-
associated depression in RBC and WBC counts in
“exposed” vs. “control” subjects. When we consider the
uncertainties in these associations and the absence of a
clear dose-response in the available studies, we find that
there are many potential confounders to a possible form-
aldehyde-associated decline in WBC and RBC counts in
blood. Some of these confounders include inappropriate
matching by exposure due to consideration of only air-
borne measurements of formaldehyde (and not dermal
or oral), no reported assessment of non-occupational
exposures to formaldehyde, differences among groups in
alcohol intake and respiratory infections, and the possi-
ble effect of formaldehyde on hematology parameters in
peripheral blood (via dermal irritation and sensitization,
as discussed in Section 5.3.4.1) in addition to other issues
such as nutrient imbalance and certain medications, all
of which may have a significant effect on hematology
parameters. Further, unlike established leukemogens
such as benzene (as discussed in Section 5.3.3), form-
aldehyde has not been associated with bone marrow
toxicity or aplastic anemia in occupationally exposed
subjects.
5.3.4.1.Subjectsexposedtoformaldehydesharecommon
immunology markers with subjects having dermatitis or
other inflammatory conditions  As reviewed by Deane
andHickey(2009),epidermalinflammationinatopicder-
matitis, psoriasis, and allergic contact dermatitis involves
the movement of leukocytes from peripheral blood to
skin. Singbartl and Ley (2004) also describe the process
of leukocyte recruitment to inflamed tissues in the case
of acute renal failure as occurring in a cascade-like fash-
ion that encompasses capture, rolling, activation, firm
adhesion, and tissue translocation of leukocytes. These
mechanisms may contribute to a decrease in blood cells
from peripheral blood in subjects with certain inflamma-
tory conditions in the skin or other organs.
The ability of liquid formaldehyde to cause dermatitis,
skin irritation, and immune modulation in occupational
and non-occupational settings is well documented.
For example, Nethercott and Holness (1988, as cited in
ATSDR 1999) showed an 11% prevalence of contact skin
dermatitis(3%positiveformaldehydeskin-patchtests)in
embalmers working at funeral homes vs. 0% in controls.
Similar results have been reported for nurses exposed to
formaldehyde disinfectant (Rudzki et al., 1989, as cited
in ATSDR 1999). Further, in a review of formaldehyde
in cosmetic products, de Groot and Maibach (2010)
find that formaldehyde applied to skin has been shown
to induce dermatitis from short-term use. Finally, in
a review of skin sensitivity to formaldehyde in various
populations, de Groot et al. (2009) found a 4.1% preva-
lence in one study of Chinese subjects and up to 9.2%
in studies from the United States. If occupational dermal
exposure to formaldehyde results in skin irritation and
dermatitis, which influence changes in concentrations
in peripheral blood of leukocytes and other hematology
parameters, these changes may explain the heterogene-
ity in response with different exposure concentrations in
the human studies summarized in Table 16. It is note-
worthy that bone marrow is dynamic in that cell loss is
compensated by cell production, and this characteristic
should be the subject of further study in the case of der-
mal reactions.

 Critical Reviews in Toxicology
There are similarities between the observed effects in
peripheral blood of some formaldehyde-exposed sub-
jects (via inhalation and possibly dermally, as discussed
above) and in subjects with dermatitis conditions. For
example, Yoshino et al. (2000) found evidence that the
degree of clinical dermatitis was associated (positively
or negatively) with peripheral mononuclear WBC counts
and that the proliferation of peripheral mononuclear
cells may be suppressed in severe atopic dermatitis cases;
the authors suggest that this is related to the high rate of
T-cell apoptosis in severe atopic dermatitis. Similarly,
Forte et al. (2009) found that a reduction in chemotactic
response and phagocytic activity by neutrophilic and/
or mononuclear phagocytes in the majority of patients
with atopic dermatitis ranged from moderate to severe.
Further, Lebre et al. (2008) found that myeloid dendritic
cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells from patients
with atopic dermatitis showed defective interleukin
(IL)-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interferon
(IFN)-α production; the authors suggest that these
immune indicators may contribute to the maintenance
of an allergic state in these patients. Dermatitis condi-
tions have been associated with increased eosinophil
counts (290 vs. 153.3  cells/mm3
, p < .05) in the blood
of patients with atopic dermatitis vs. healthy subjects,
respectively (Jenerowicz et al., 2007). From the periph-
eral blood eosinophil count and eosinophil percent of
blood cells, we calculated a lower mean WBC count in
subjects ­having dermatitis vs. healthy subjects (4581 vs.
4746 WBCs/mm3
, respectively; 30 subjects per group),
but it was not possible to assess whether these counts
were statistically significantly different from each other,
since the raw data were not provided for the individual
subjects in this study. Since hematology changes can be
associated with allergic reactions in general, and derma-
titis in particular, and because formaldehyde can cause
dermatitis and dermal sensitivity, an assessment of skin
reactions to formaldehyde is necessary when investigat-
ing formaldehyde-induced hematology effects.
If skin reactions are indeed present in the study
subjects, they may confound the hematology findings
reported by many of the aforementioned studies. Dermal
exposure to formaldehyde and its effects on clinical and
subclinical skin sensitivity reactions are not reported in
the human studies we reviewed. However, it is possible
that the subjects in the studies by Zhang et al. (2010b),
Lyapina et al. (2004), Srivastava et al. (1992), and in the
studies cited by Tang et al. (2009) were exposed dermally
to formaldehyde. In addition, the status of sensitization
or inflammation in exposed vs. control individuals in
these studies is largely unknown. Further, Farage (2008)
reported that skin reactions may not be easily diagnosed
by visual inspection and may require more sophisticated
technology that is not widely available. Therefore, even if
subjects with higher air exposures to formaldehyde had
some form of skin reaction to formaldehyde, the possibil-
ity exists that this condition would not be detected by a
clinician.
5.3.4.2.  A recent respiratory infection can result in
hematological changes—Subjects with exposure to form-
aldehyde in the study by Zhang et al. (2010b) were more
likely than control subjects to have had recent respira-
tory tract infections  Several studies suggest that respi-
ratory infections can be associated with leukopenia, or
decreased WBC counts in peripheral blood, in humans.
Cummins et al. (1998) found a 5% decrease (p = .02) in
total leukocyte counts in blood and a 9% decline (p = .001)
in lymphocyte counts in 70 elderly subjects 4 weeks after
they received an influenza vaccine. These results are sup-
ported by those from three cases of pediatric influenza
infections that were associated with declines in periph-
eral blood WBC counts (Rice and Resar, 1998). Further,
a study by Shen et  al. (2008) showed that not only do
infections modify hematology parameters, but also that
the type of infection could be important. For example,
children with influenza B infection had a significantly
lower total WBC count than those with influenza A
infection. Influenza infection has also been shown to
cause or exacerbate bone marrow suppression in mice
(Lavrov and Semenkov, 1991; Hyland et al., 2005). Shen
et al. (2008) found that leukopenia is not an uncommon
occurrence in influenza infections and that this decline
in WBC counts is possibly related to B-lymphocyte apop-
tosis in bone marrow.
The higher rate of recent respiratory infections in the
exposed vs. control groups of the study by Zhang et al.
(2010b) could have resulted in confounding of hematol-
ogy parameters. Alternatively, it may be argued that the
higher rate of recent respiratory infections in the exposed
workersisduetolowerWBCcountsorthatrespiratorytract
infections could either increase or decrease WBC counts
in peripheral blood (Mayo Clinic, 2008) and may, there-
fore, be unrelated to the findings in this study. However,
all reported WBC counts for ­formaldehyde-exposed
subjects and their controls are above 4900 cells/mm3
of
blood (e.g., Tang et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010b), which
are higher than the Mayo Clinic’s benchmark of 3500
cells/mm3
for leukopenia (Mayo Clinic, 2008). Therefore,
it is less likely that the lower WBC count is the cause of
the recent infections in the exposed subjects. Better-
matched exposure and control groups in future studies
may eliminate this potential confounder.
5.3.4.3.  Other unmeasured potential confounders  As
discussed in the preceding subsections, several condi-
tions may be associated with decreased WBC and RBC
counts in peripheral blood. In a study of adult Japanese
male office workers, Nakanishi et al. (2003) found that
WBC counts increased with increasing body mass index
and smoking, but decreased with alcohol intake, nutri-
tional balance, and hours worked per day. Here we focus
on two possible confounders of hematology parameters
that may be associated with oral or inhalation exposure
to formaldehyde: (1) the effects of formaldehyde on the
hypothalamic/pituitary/adrenal (HPA) axis involvement
in WBC count modulation; (2) the effect, on the kidneys,
Formaldehyde as a leukemogen—Weight of evidence  605

of possible exposure to melamine from formaldehyde-
melamine resins (which were the source of formaldehyde
exposures in the study by Zhang et al., 2010b); kidneys
are important in producing erythropoietin, the hormone
responsible for inducing RBC production.
There is evidence to suggest that formaldehyde expo-
sure can modulate WBC counts in peripheral blood via
an endocrine pathway. Brondeau et  al. (1990) found
that exposure to airborne irritants (including formal-
dehyde) caused leukopenia at irritant levels (≥43 ppm
for formaldehyde, in an exposure-dependent manner)
over a 4-hour exposure, and that this effect was pre-
vented by removal of the adrenal gland, suggesting a
possible role for this gland in apparent hematological
effects. Sari et  al. (2004) also found that relatively low
concentrations (0.08, 0.4, and 2.0 ppm) of formaldehyde
increased hypothalamus/pituitary/adrenal (HPA) axis
activity by increasing the numbers of both hypothala-
mus corticotropin releasing hormone-immunoreactive
neurons and pituitary adrenocorticotropin hormone
(ACTH)-immunoreactive cells in mice. These neuronal
changes were paralleled by increased mRNA expres-
sion of pituitary ACTH, which functions in regulating
adrenal gland function. It is also well established that
the adrenal glands produce glucocorticoids, mainly cor-
tisol, a steroid that can suppress the immune response
(Cotran et al., 1999). Although more research is needed
to investigate the potential effect of formaldehyde on
WBC counts via an endocrine pathway, particularly at
occupationally relevant concentrations, there is sugges-
tive evidence that it occurs. This HPA pathway should be
considered when evaluating hematology data associated
with formaldehyde exposure.
The recent discovery that melamine can cause or
contribute to renal toxicity may have implications for the
consumption of melamine when it is either present as
an adulterant in food or inhaled during its manufacture
or processing. In patients who have kidney disease it is
likely that production of erythropoietin, the hormone
responsible for inducing RBC production, is depressed.
As a result, the bone marrow makes fewer RBCs and
therefore patients with kidney disease often have to take
erythropoietin supplements (NIH, 2008). This notion of
melamine-induced changes in RBC counts and hemo-
globin concentration finds support from Srivastava
et al. (1992) who reported declines in hemoglobin con-
centration and elevations in lymphocyte counts, but
not other hematology indicators, in workers with con-
siderable exposure to formaldehyde-melamine resin.
Moreover, Dobson et  al. (2008) found that melamine
or melamine cyanuric acid ingestion in rats caused
renal toxicity. Further, acute renal failure has also been
reported in human infants in Beijing, China, who were
exposed to melamine via a popular Chinese brand of
milk formula, “Sanlu” (Sun et  al., 2010). The role for
melamine in renal toxicity and how it might be related to
changes in RBC counts and Hb concentration in blood
is important, particularly when analyzing the results
of the study by Zhang et al. (2010b). Consideration of
melamine exposure in the Zhang et  al. (2010b) study
participants is important, since the study participants
were potentially exposed by inhalation and ingestion to
formaldehyde-melamine resins at work, and they were
possibly exposed to melamine from food items made or
contaminated with melamine-adulterated milk powder
outside work.
Finally, there are several other potential confounders
of hematology parameters in occupational studies. For
example, alcohol consumption, which is a potential con-
founder in the study by Zhang et al. (2010b), can modu-
lateimmunefunction(SzaboandMandrekar,2009).Also,
nutritional deficiencies in folic acid and cyanocobalamin
(vitamin B12) have been associated with megaloblastic
anemia, which manifests with faulty RBCs that are larger
than normal (increased MCV) (Morris et  al., 2007).
Further, certain herbal supplements, such as Echinacea,
have been associated with depressed WBC counts after
chronic ingestion (Kemp and Franco, 2002). It is thus
possible that WBC and RBC counts in peripheral blood
are modulated by formaldehyde exposure in mecha-
nisms involving extramedullary systems (i.e., outside the
bone marrow); this would contribute to confounding in
epidemiology studies that result in observed differences
between exposed and controls.
Future studies investigating a possible association
between exposure to formaldehyde and hematotoxicity
should consider a number of confounders, including, but
not limited to, the ones discussed here.
5.4.  Summary
As a whole, the available studies of formaldehyde hema-
totoxicity in both animals and humans provide little evi-
dencetosupporttheaccountthatformaldehydeexposure
is causally associated with leukemia. The animal studies
generally reported neither hematotoxicity nor leukemia
associated with formaldehyde inhalation or ingestion.
The two studies, one of which is not peer-reviewed,
that reported some evidence of formaldehyde-induced
leukemia are not convincing of such an association due
to (1) inconsistent and potentially flawed data that has
been dismissed by both EFSA and ATSDR (as discussed
in Section 5.3.1.2) (Soffritti et  al., 1989, 2002); (2) the
high background tumor rate in the animal models used
(DeVoney et al., 2006 poster, 2010 poster abstract); (3) the

lack of corroboration from numerous other studies that
examined the same endpoints in animals.
A few human studies, as cited by secondary sources,
may be consistent with hematotoxicity, but they are
inconsistent with other study findings and plagued by
possible confounding. As discussed in Section 5.3.2,
the studies suggestive of hematotoxicity are reported
by Tang et al. (2009) and Zhang et al. (2010b). However,
because the only study of hematological effects cited by
Tang et al. (2009) available in English (Kuo et al., 1997)
is associated with several uncertainties, the conclusions
drawn by Tang et al. (2009) are weakened. Until the other
studies cited by Tang et al. (2009) are translated, many
questions exist about the outcomes and exposure-related
uncertainties in the findings. Many medical and lifestyle
factors can contribute to changes in hematology, par-
ticularly declines in WBC and RBC counts. The study by
Zhang et al. (2010b) provides some evidence to support
an association between formaldehyde and hematotoxic-
ity; however, as discussed in Sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.4, this
study’s outcomes are mixed and may suffer from poten-
tial confounding of results by recent respiratory tract
infections and leukopenia resulting from possible der-
matitis. When considering the many possible known and
unknown confounders in the studies we reviewed, such
as dermatitis, respiratory infection, alcohol consump-
tion, non-occupational sources of formaldehyde, etc., it
is impossible to rule out confounding. In addition, many
of the human studies are cross-sectional and therefore
cannot adequately show cause and effect. Moreover, the
available data from human studies do not provide suf-
ficient proof for formaldehyde-induced hematotoxicity
particularlywhenanimalstudiesprovidestrongevidence
against it. If formaldehyde is hematotoxic in humans,
this toxicity would likely be via a mechanism not feasible
in rodents, rhesus monkeys, or beagle dogs, since formal-
dehyde exposure does not cause hematotoxicity in these
animals, therefore bringing into the question of biologi-
cal plausibility of formaldehyde-induced hematotoxicity
in humans.
Finally, the question of potential formaldehyde-
induced hematoxicity can be explored by considering
information on epidemiology and mode-of-action stud-
ies. As part of the HBWoE approach, one considers the
cross-discipline integration of hypothesized effects. As
discussed herein, the epidemiology and mode-of-action
data cast doubt on the ability of inhaled formaldehyde
to interact with and perturb hematopoiesis, which com-
plicates further the plausibility of a conclusion of causal
association based on the observations in the hematotox-
icity and animal leukemia studies.
6.  Weight of evidence regarding a
plausible mode of action for formaldehyde
leukemogenesis
In the following analysis, we examine the data relevant
to the modes of action that have been proposed for
formaldehyde leukemogenesis. We focused on studies
that examined formaldehyde metabolism and distri-
bution, and genotoxicity in animals, humans, and in
vitro. We conducted literature searches, using PubMed
and several search terms in combination with “form-
aldehyde”: “genom*,” “chromosom*,” “micronuclei,”
“cytogenetic,” “DNA damage,” “genotox*,” “mutagen*,”
“metabol*,” “toxicokinetic,” and “pharmacokinetic.”
We also relied on recent key review articles and agency
reports (IARC, 2006; US EPA, 2010; Heck and Casanova,
2004; Pyatt et al., 2008; Golden et al., 2006), as well as
references within those reports and papers found in the
PubMed search.
As discussed, the epidemiology data do not support
a causal association between formaldehyde exposure
and leukemia. In addition, the available studies of form-
aldehyde hematotoxicity in both animals and humans
provide little evidence for formaldehyde-associated
leukemia. The animal studies generally reported neither
hematotoxicity nor leukemia associated with formalde-
hyde exposure, and although a few human study findings
are consistent with hematotoxicity, they are inconsis-
tent with other study findings and plagued by possible
confounding.
Despite these findings, three modes of action for form-
aldehyde leukemogenesis have been hypothesized by
Zhang (2009, 2010a) and are also discussed in US EPA’s
recent draft toxicological profile for formaldehyde (US
EPA, 2010). The proposed modes of action are as follows:
Formaldehydetargetingbonemarrowhematopoietic1.	
stem cells—formaldehyde complexes as a hydrate
[CH2
(OH)2
] that could potentially reach the bone
marrow, where it could directly induce DNA dam-
age and chromosomal aberrations in hematopoietic
stem or progenitor cells, leading to leukemia.
Formaldehyde targeting nasal stem cells (nasal-2.	
associated lymphoid tissue, or NALT)—nasal stem
cells are damaged by formaldehyde, released from
the nasal passage, circulate in the blood, and are
eventually incorporated into bone marrow leading to
leukemia.
Formaldehyde targeting circulating hematopoietic3.	
stem cells—stem cells circulate from marrow to nasal
tissue where they are transformed by formaldehyde
(pre-mutagenic lesions), and then migrate back to
bone marrow, eventually leading to leukemia.
 Here we first describe what is known about formalde-
hyde metabolism, biological distribution, and genotox-
icity. We then provide a weight-of-evidence analysis of
the formaldehyde data with regard to the three proposed
modes of action.
6.1.  Formaldehyde toxicokinetics
The toxicokinetics of formaldehyde has been extensively
studied and is summarized in recent reviews and agency
toxicological profiles (ATSDR, 1999; ATSDR, 2010;
Formaldehyde as a leukemogen—Weight of evidence  607
© 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.
Heck and Casanova, 2004; IARC, 2006; US EPA, 2010).
Formaldehyde is a normal by-product of several meta-
bolic pathways in mammals, and is naturally present in
tissues, cells, and biological fluids. Under physiological
conditions, it exists in equilibrium, predominantly in its
hydrated form methanediol [CH2
(OH)2
], with less than
0.1% as free formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is water solu-
ble and highly reactive; therefore, it is readily absorbed
and metabolized in biological systems. It is primarily
metabolized by glutathione-dependent formaldehyde
dehydrogenase (FALDH) and aldehyde dehydrogenases
(ALDHs). Formaldehyde enters the “one-carbon” pool
and is readily incorporated into macromolecules in the
body. In rats exposed to [14
C]formaldehyde via inhalation
(0.63 or 13 ppm), the exhaled fraction was independent
of exposure concentration, with 40% of the 14
C incorpo-
rated into macromolecules and 40% exhaled as 14
CO2
,
and the remainder was excreted in the feces and urine,
and incorporation into macromolecules in the blood was
via the one-carbon pool and not through DNA or protein
adducts (Heck et al., 1983, as cited in Heck and Casanova,
2004). Salthammer et al. (2010) discusses a median con-
centration of 4.3 ppb formaldehyde in human breath that
is likely due to endogenous sources.
The concentration of endogenous formaldehyde in
human blood is approximately 0.1 mM and, as discussed
in Heck and Casanova (2004), this concentration is not
increased in humans who inhale 2 ppm formaldehyde
for 40 minutes or in monkeys inhaling 6 ppm for 4 weeks.
The inability of exogenous formaldehyde to increase
blood concentrations of formaldehyde was confirmed
in an analysis by Franks (2005) using a sophisticated
mathematical model. These data strongly suggest that,
at concentrations to which humans might be exposed,
formaldehyde does not move beyond the nasal mucosa
to cause effects at distant sites. Recent dosimetry, cyto-
toxicity, and genomics studies conducted by Andersen
et al. (2010) suggest that exposure to formaldehyde con-
centrations of 1 to 2 ppm would not affect formaldehyde
homeostasis or increase genotoxic and cytotoxic effects
in the nose or in any other tissue. Andersen et al. (2010)
developed a pharmacokinetic model to estimate vari-
ous forms of formaldehyde and glutathione (GSH) tis-
sue concentrations, accounting for enogenous levels of
formaldehyde, and applied the model to compare tissue
concentrations with histopathology and gene expression
changes in the nasal epithelium of rats. The study found
that at high exposure concentrations (6 to 15 ppm), gene
expression changes reflected pathways involved in cell
cycle control, DNA repair, and apoptosis, with tissue
responses including cell proliferation, erosion, necrosis,
and increased severity of squamous metaplasia—cellular
responses potentially associated with carcinogenesis. At
lower exposure concentrations (less than 1 to 2 ppm), the
gene expression changes likely represented extracellular
responses (such as responses to irritancy and to export
GSH to extracellular spaces), with tissue responses at 2
ppm reflecting mild squamous metaplasia.
6.2.  Formaldehyde genotoxicity
Formaldehyde induces a variety of genotoxic and muta-
genic effects, including DNA protein cross-links (DPX),
DNA adducts, point mutations, DNA strand breaks, chro-
mosomal aberrations (CA), deletions, sister-chromatid
exchange (SCE), and micronucleus (MN) formation
(ATSDR, 1999; ATSDR, 2010; Heck and Casanova, 2004;
IARC, 2006; US EPA, 2010).
6.2.1.  DNA adducts and protein cross-links
At high exposure concentrations, formaldehyde causes
DNA-proteincross-links(DPX)inthenasalmucosaofrats,
upper respiratory tract of monkeys, and in vitro in human
cells (Heck and Casanova, 2004; ATSDR, 1999; ATSDR,
2010; IARC, 2006; US EPA, 2010). Pharmacokinetic mod-
els have been used to study the disposition of inhaled
[14
C]formaldehyde in the respiratory tract. At very low
concentrations of formaldehyde, nearly 100% is elimi-
nated through metabolism or through non-saturable
pathways other than DPX (such as protein adducts), with
very little (7 × 10−6
%) bound as DPX. At higher concentra-
tions (6 ppm, 6 hours) in rats and Rhesus monkeys, 91%
and 96% of the [14
C]formaldehyde in the DNA was due to
metabolic incorporation, and approximately 9% and 4%
of the [14
C]formaldehyde in the DNA was bound as DPX
in the nasal respiratory mucosa, respectively (Heck and
Casanova, 2004). Studies suggest that formaldehyde-in-
duced DPX are rapidly removed (24 hours) from human
blood cultures treated in vitro (Schmid and Speit, 2007),
and from the nasal respiratory mucosa of rats exposed
via inhalation to formaldehyde (6, 10 ppm) (Heck and
Casanova, 2004).
There is no strong evidence to suggest that formalde-
hyde causes DPX in bone marrow or WBCs (discussed in
more detail in the next section). A recent study by Wang
et al. (2009a) found higher levels of the formaldehyde-
DNA adduct N6
-hydroxymethyldeoxyadenosine (N6
-
HOMe-dA) in leukocytes of smokers vs. non-smokers.
The authors suggest that N6
-HOMe-dA adducts in leu-
kocyte DNA may be potentially important as a cause of
cancer from smoking. A recent study by Lu et al. (2010),
in which rats were exposed via inhalation to 10 ppm deu-
terium-labeled formaldehyde (i.e., [13
CD2
]formaldehyde)
to trace the disposition of exogenous vs. endogenous
formaldehyde in DNA, found exogenous formaldehyde-
DNA adducts in the nasal respiratory mucosa but not
at distant sites (including WBCs and bone marrow). In
addition, Lu et al. (2010) found that exogenous formal-
dehyde caused only N2
-HOMe-dG adducts in the nasal
mucosa and no N6
-HOMe-dA adducts; however, both
adducts were found in distant sites but only from endog-
enous formaldehyde. Another study by Lu et al. (2011)
examined molecular dosimetry (0.7, 2, 5.8, 9.1, and 15.2
ppm [13
CD2
]formaldehyde for 6 hours) of endogenous
and exogenous N2
-HOMe-dG adducts in the nasal
mucosa of rats. The authors found that endogenous
adducts dominated at low exposure concentrations
(more than 99% and 97% endogenous at 0.7 and 2 ppm,
608  L. R. Rhomberg et al.
 Critical Reviews in Toxicology
respectively). Further, the authors examined the levels
of endogenous and exogenous N2
-HOMe-dG adducts in
bone marrow from exposure to 15.2 ppm formaldehyde
and found that exogenous adducts were not detectable.
A similar study conducted by the same group (Moeller
et  al., 2011) examined the levels of endogenous and
exogenous N2
-HOMe-dG adducts in the nasal mucosa
and bone marrow of cynomolgus macaques exposed to
1.9 and 6.1 ppm [13
CD2
]formaldehyde for 6 hours a day
for 2 consecutive days. The authors observed readily
detectable levels of exogenous and endogenous adducts
in the nasal mucosa at both exposures; however, only
endogenous adducts were detectable in the bone mar-
row. These data strongly suggest that the results observed
by Wang et  al. (2009a) may be specific to effects from
cigarette smoke (i.e., the generation of formaldehyde
from metabolism of N-nitrosodimethylamine [NDMA]
and 4-(methylnitorosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone
[NNK]) and not from exogenous formaldehyde. In
addition, Lu et al. (2010, 2011) and Moeller et al. (2011)
providestrongevidencetosupportthebiologicalimplau-
sibility of distant site carcinogenicity, such as leukemia,
from inhaled formaldehyde, while providing evidence
that formaldehyde inhalation can lead to DNA adducts
in respiratory nasal epithelium. In addition, Neuss et al.
(2010) show that human nasal epithelial cells pre-ex-
posed in vitro to high concentrations of formaldehyde do
not cause DNA damage (DPX) in co-cultivated isolated
human lymphocytes, lending further support that form-
aldehyde that has entered the nasal epithelial cells does
not move beyond these cells to damage DNA in other
cells in close proximity (discussed in more detail below
with respect to the NALT hypothesis).
6.2.2.  Clastogenic and cytogenetic effects
In vivo mammalian formaldehyde genotoxicity assays
have examined clastogenic and cytogenetic effects (CA,
SCE, and MN formation) in rodents and humans, and
the results have been summarized (ATSDR, 1999; ATSDR,
2010;HeckandCasanova,2004;IARC,2006;USEPA,2010).
As presented in these reviews, the cytogenetic results in
humans and animals are conflicting, showing both posi-
tive and negative effects. In humans, the majority of these
studies have been carried out in nasal or oral mucosa (to
examine site of direct contact) and in peripheral blood
lymphocytes (PBLs) (to examine distant-site toxicity). As
reviewed by Speit and Schmid (2006) and agency reviews
(IARC, 2006; US EPA, 2010), the published studies suggest
that inhalation of formaldehyde leads to increased MN
frequencies in nasal and/or buccal mucosa cells. There are
a number of issues with these studies, however, including
incomplete information on study design, exposure, and
potential confounding factors (Speit and Schmid, 2006).
Speit and Schmid (2006) suggest that because of this, it is
not yet possible to make meaningful conclusions regard-
ing local genotoxic effects of formaldehyde.
From our review of the current literature, and from
studies summarized in recent agency reviews (IARC,
2006; US EPA, 2010; Jakab et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2010;
Pala et al., 2008), to date, approximately 20 studies have
examined the cytogenetic effects of formaldehyde in
human PBLs, as a means for examining distant-site toxic-
ity. These data are insufficient and conflicting, with both
positive and negative results. As discussed in several
recent reviews (Heck and Casanova, 2004; Pyatt et  al.,
2008; Golden et al., 2006), and in more detail in the next
section, interpretation of the positive findings in humans,
particularly in the context of leukemia, is problematic
given (1) potential confounding in the studies, including
diet and life style differences, or the lack of good expo-
sure information; (2) the lack of evidence to suggest that
DNA damage in human PBLs is a model for DNA damage
in stem cells, since these effects have not been shown to
occur in stem cells that can transition to leukemia; and
(3) similar results have not been found in controlled ani-
mal studies. For example, Kligerman et al. (1984) found
no statistically significant increase in SCE or chromo-
some breakage in PBLs of rats exposed to formaldehyde
(0.5, 6, or 15 ppm). A similar study carried out recently by
Speit et al. (2009) found that formaldehyde (0.5, 1, 2, 6,
10, and 15 ppm) did not induce any significant genotoxic
effects (DPX, SCE, or MN) in PBLs of rats.
6.3. HBWoE evaluation of the proposed modes of
action for formaldehyde as a leukemogen
Theplausibilityofthethreeproposedmodesofactionhas
been extensively reviewed by others (Pyatt et al., 2008;
Golden et al., 2006). We have considered these reviews,
in addition to the primary formaldehyde inhalation tox-
icity literature, and have come to the following questions
with regard to the proposed modes of action:
What is the evidence that formaldehyde exposure1.	
induces carcinogenic (or genotoxic) transformation
directly in bone marrow?
What is the evidence that formaldehyde can induce2.	
carcinogenic (or genotoxic) transformation in nasal-
associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), or peripheral
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)?
Is the DNA damage observed in the formaldehyde3.	
genotoxicity studies consistent with DNA damage
associated with leukemia?

age, what concentrations in the nose would it take
to reach levels higher than endogenous formalde-
hyde DNA adduct levels in the NALT or circulating
HSCs to cause a sufficient level of DNA damage that
would induce cell proliferation in the bone marrow?
Would these concentrations be relevant to typical
human formaldehyde exposures? How do these con-
centrations compare to levels that would also cause
irritation?
If formaldehyde could induce DNA adducts above5.	
endogenous levels in NALT or circulating HSCs, what
is the likelihood that these cells would home back to
healthy bone marrow to cause leukemia?
Formaldehyde as a leukemogen—Weight of evidence  609

 As a whole, considering these questions allows for an
assessment of the extent to which the genotoxicity and
mode-of-action data support either a causal association
between formaldehyde exposure and leukemia or an
alternative hypothesis. Importantly, one needs to con-
sider the mode-of-action data in the context of the epi-
demiology and hematotoxicity data, as each of the three
lines of evidence inform interpretation of the other.
6.3.1.  There is no consistent evidence that inhaled
formaldehyde induces genotoxicity in bone marrow, NALT, or
peripheral HSCs that might lead to leukemia
Although the evidence clearly indicates that formalde-
hyde induces DPX in nasal mucosa of rats and the upper
respiratory tract of monkeys (Heck and Casanova, 2004),
a large body of evidence suggests that formaldehyde does
not move beyond the respiratory mucosa to induce sys-
temicgenotoxiceffectsandcellulartransformation(Heck
and Casanova, 2004; Pyatt et al., 2008; Golden et al., 2006,
Andersen, et al., 2010). These data are discussed in more
detail below in the context of the distant sites (bone mar-
row, NALT, or peripheral HSCs) relevant to the proposed
formaldehyde leukemogenic modes of action.
6.3.1.1. Bone marrow  Zhang et  al. (2009) hypothesize
thatformaldehydemaypotentiallyreachthebonemarrow
in its hydrated methanediol form where some level of free
formaldehyde may exist in equilibrium with methandiol
so that it could react with bone marrow stem cells to cause
leukemia. This is very unlikely, however, given that, as dis-
cussed above, the levels of formaldehyde in the blood do
not increase even with reasonably high exposure levels in
humans (2 ppm). As discussed below, there are studies to
support the implausibility of this mechanism.
As discussed in Heck and Casanova (2004), studies
using radiolabeled formaldehyde have shown that there
is a lack of detectable DPX in the bone marrow of rats
exposed to 15 ppm formaldehyde (Casanova-Schmitz
et  al., 1984), in bone marrow of GSH-depleted rats
exposed to 10 ppm formaldehyde (Casanova and Heck,
1987), and in Rhesus monkeys exposed to formaldehyde
at concentrations as high as 6 ppm (Heck and Casanova,
2004). Further, as discussed above, recent studies (Lu
et al., 2010, 2011; Moeller et al., 2011), using [13
CD2
]form-
aldehyde, clearly indicate that exogenous formaldehyde
does not induce DNA damage beyond the nasal tissue
(i.e., bone marrow).
In addition, cytogenetic assays in bone marrow of
Sprague-Dawley rats (Dallas et al., 1992) exposed to 15
ppm formaldehyde, and mice exposed to formaldehyde
via intraperitoneal injection (Natarajan et  al., 1983 as
cited in US EPA, 2010; Gocke et al., 1981), observed no
significant increase in CA or MN in bone marrow cells
relative to controls. In contrast, one study by Kitaeva
et al. (1990, abstract only) of Wistar rats exposed to very
low concentrations of formaldehyde (0.4 to 1.2 ppm)
observed an increased incidence of CA in bone marrow
cells relative to controls. This one study is not supported
by results from the other three studies discussed. In addi-
tion, as discussed in Heck and Casanova (2004) and in
Golden et al. (2006), this study is hampered by a lack of
critical experimental details (i.e., dose levels and other
experimental procedures are not clear, and statistical
methods were not described properly) that precludes its
use in drawing any meaningful conclusions.
Overall, the weight of evidence does not support the
proposed mode of action that inhaled formaldehyde
moves beyond the nasal respiratory mucosa to cause
genotoxicity in the bone marrow.
6.3.1.2.  Stem cells in the NALT  Zhang et  al. (2009)
hypothesize another potential mode of action involving
direct induction of mutations in the pluripotent stem
cells of the nasal passage (or the NALT), and that these
stem cells could then be released into the circulation
where they could eventually make their way to the bone
marrow. There are several lines of evidence, discussed
below, that suggest the implausibility of this proposed
mechanism.
First, if precursor cells in nasal tissue were acted upon
in this way, there should also be generation of chloro-
mas in the nasal tissue, since isolated accumulations of
myeloid tumor cells would be expected to originate from
the same proposed precursor cells in nasal tissue. There
is no sign of chloromas, however, among formaldehyde-
exposed workers in the current literature. Further, as dis-
cussed in Pyatt et al. (2008), all lymphoid tumors arising
from the NALT have been classifiable as non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (NHL), which is not elevated in the formal-
dehyde occupational epidemiology studies. The lack of
chloromas and NHL arising in the NALT (nasal lympho-
mas) in the epidemiology data provide strong evidence
against this mode of action.
Recent experimental evidence directly examining
this proposed mechanism suggests its implausibility.
Kuper et al. (2009) examined the proliferative effect of
formaldehyde on the NALT and local lymph nodes in
F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice exposed to 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6,
10, and 15 ppm formaldehyde for 28 days. The authors
found an increased proliferation rate in the nasal epi-
thelial cells and a slight to moderate simple hyperplasia
of the NALT in rats exposed to 15 ppm but not at lower
concentrations, and no increases were observed at any
concentration in mice, suggesting that at concentra-
tions of less than 15 ppm formaldehyde, sufficient levels
of formaldehyde do not move beyond the nasal mucosa
to the NALT to induce cell proliferation. Given these
observations, it is worth considering whether it is bio-
logically plausible to incur enough damage in the NALT
tissue, from typical human formaldehyde exposures,
that would be sufficient to have other manifestations.
Although levels lower than 15 ppm formaldehyde do
not induce proliferation in the NALT, one might argue
that DNA damage may still occur at low levels of expo-
sure; if this damage is in a pluripotent stem cell that is
released into the circulation and the DNA is sufficiently
610  L. R. Rhomberg et al.
 Critical Reviews in Toxicology
damaged such that carcinogenic initiation could occur,
this cell might home back to bone marrow to cause
leukemia. But, one must ask whether this is quantita-
tively plausible, particularly since mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue (such as the NALT) represent small
concentrations of tissue. Stochastic models of carcino-
genesis have been developed that suggest human can-
cers are the result of a multistage process requiring at
least two genetic alterations for carcinogenic transfor-
mation (Moolgavkar et al., 1999). With the understand-
ing that malignant tumors arise from a single malignant
progenitor cell, we must ask whether there is a strong
enough stochastic argument to support the hypothesis
that formaldehyde exposure (at typical human exposure
concentrations of 2 ppm or less) would hit enough stem
cells in the NALT such that there is a reasonable likeli-
hood that the critical genes, in at least one of the stem
cells that is released into the circulation, would be suf-
ficiently damaged to cause carcinogenic initiation, and
further that there is a reasonable likelihood that the ini-
tiated stem cell will home back to healthy bone marrow
to cause leukemogenesis. Given the stochastic nature of
carcinogenesis, the relatively small amount of NALT tis-
sue, and the gene expression results of Andersen et al.
(2010) that suggest 2 ppm formaldehyde exposure is not
likely to increase genotoxic and cytotoxic effects in the
nose or in any other tissue, the probability that there is
enough damage in the NALT to lead to further carcino-
genic manifestations beyond the nose is likely very small
at typical human exposure concentrations. Further, the
level of damage required to reach quantitative plausi-
bility would likely result in other manifestations in the
nose, such as chloromas, which are rarely observed.
In another study, Neuss et al. (2010) show that human
nasal epithelial cells pre-exposed in vitro to high con-
centrations of formaldehyde do not cause DNA damage
(DPX) in co-cultivated isolated human lymphocytes,
lending further support that formaldehyde that has
entered the nasal epithelial cells does not move beyond
these cells to damage other cells in close proximity, such
as progenitor stem cells in the nasal mucosa.
Zhang et al. (2009) cite a study by Murell et al. (2005)
in support of the NALT mode of action, since this study
provides some support for the ability of rat olfactory
epithelial cells to repopulate hematopoietic tissue in
bone marrow of irradiated rats. The olfactory mucosa
stem cells used in the Murell et al. (2005) study, how-
ever, were tested for their ability to repopulate ablated
irradiated rat bone marrow. As discussed in more
detail below, a number of studies (McKinney-Freeman
and Goodell, 2004; Abkowitz et al., 2003; Edgren et al.,
2007) suggest that the majority of circulating stem cells
do not efficiently home back to bone marrow under
homeostatic conditions.
Overall, the weight of evidence does not support the
proposed mode of action that formaldehyde exposure, at
reasonably expected concentrations in humans, targets
stem cells in the NALT, such that these cells would then
be released into the circulation to home back to the bone
marrow to cause leukemia.
6.3.1.3.  CirculatingperipheralHSCs  Zhanget al.(2009)
propose another mode of action for formaldehyde-
induced leukemia, suggesting that formaldehyde could
move beyond the nasal tissue into the circulation where
it may transform circulating HSCs that could travel back
to the bone marrow.
As discussed already, many studies have examined
the cytogenetic effects of formaldehyde in human
PBLs as a means for examining distant-site toxicity,
but these data are conflicting, with both positive and
negative results. In addition, controlled animal studies
did not find any significant genotoxic effects (SCE, MN,
or CA) in PBLs of rats exposed to high levels of form-
aldehyde (15 ppm) (Kligerman et al., 1984; Speit et al.,
2009). Furthermore, although it is not an unreasonable
assumption, observations from studies of circulating
blood lymphocytes should not necessarily be taken
to mean that the same effects will occur in circulating
stem cells that then could transition to leukemia. Only
one study to date has examined whether cytogenetic
effects in cultured hematopoietic progenitor cells from
peripheral blood were increased in workers exposed to
formaldehyde (Zhang et  al., 2010b), and as discussed
in more detail below, there are several problems with
interpretation of this study. Therefore, interpretation
of the positive cytogenetic findings (beyond the nasal
mucosa) in humans, particularly in the context of leu-
kemia, is problematic.
First, as discussed earlier, there is a large body of
evidence suggesting that inhaled formaldehyde does
not move beyond the nasal respiratory mucosa to cause
genotoxicityatdistantsites,includinglymphocytes(Heck
and Casanova, 2004; Pyatt et al., 2008; Golden et al., 2006;
Schmid and Speit, 2007; Speit et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2010,
2011; Moeller et al., 2011; Neuss et al., 2010). Although
Shaham et al. (1996, 1997, 2003) reported increased levels
of protein-associated DNA (presumed to be DPX) in the
lymphocytes of hospital workers (laboratory assistants
and technicians, physicians, orderlies, and pathologists),
as discussed by Heck and Casanova (2004) and Pyatt et al.
(2008), there are many problems with these studies. For
example, the authors claimed that DPX could be detected
down to 0.001 mM; however, their data do not provide
any evidence of a concentration-response relationship
for DPX below 0.3 mM. Further, Shaham et  al. (1996,
1997) indicate that DPX are persistent and can accumu-
late in lymphocytes. Their data, however, do not support
their assertion and are contradictory to studies showing
the rapid removal of DPX from formaldehyde-exposed
human blood in culture (Schmid and Speit, 2007), and
from the nasal respiratory mucosa of rats exposed to
formaldehyde via inhalation (Heck and Casanova,
2004). Further, with regard to chromosomal aberrations
observed in PBLs, as shown by Schmid and Speit (2007),
SCEs are formed from DNA synthesis through DPX
Formaldehyde as a leukemogen—Weight of evidence  611

during S-phase in human blood cultures. These results
suggest that, given the rapid removal of DPX, it is unlikely
that a sufficient amount of formaldehyde-induced DPX
would persist through DNA replication in occupationally
exposed workers. This further suggests that reported SCE
frequencies in PBLs of workers exposed to formaldehyde
are unrelated to any formaldehyde exposure. The authors
extend this argument for other cytogenetic events as well
(MN and CA).
Second, interpretation of many of the human PBL
studies of formaldehyde-exposed workers is limited due
to the lack of reliable exposure information and poten-
tial confounding by exposures to other chemicals in the
workplace or other factors that may impact background
levels of CA and MN. Several studies (Battershill et al.,
2008; Iarmarcovai et al., 2008, 2007) suggest that many
factors, including age, gender, smoking status, alcohol
consumption,diseaseconditionsandinfections,physical
exercise, and vitamin B12 and folate status impact back-
ground levels of CA and MN in PBLs (albeit some factors
stronger than others). Battershill et al. (2008) suggest that
the evaluation of PBLs as genotoxicity biomarkers is com-
plex, requiring good exposure data, appropriate strati-
fication of exposed groups, and appropriate statistical
power. Given the general limitations in the human PBL
studies, it is not surprising that the results with respect to
formaldehyde are inconsistent.
Third, observations from studies of circulating blood
lymphocytes should not necessarily be taken to mean
that the same effects will occur in circulating stem cells
that then could transition to leukemia. In fact, CA and
MN in PBLs are associated with many types of cancers,
and they appear to be a general marker for increased
cancer risk, not specific to leukemia (Bonassi et al., 2008;
Murgia et  al., 2008). In these studies, it is noteworthy
that increased CA in PBLs are not associated with occu-
pational exposures to genotoxic agents. Further, as dis-
cussed in Pyatt et al. (2008), there are many commonly
used drugs with clastogenic properties in vitro and in
vivo (methotrexate), and in human lymphocytes in vitro
(including antibiotics metronidazole, trimethoprin, and
hydrochlorothiazide). Therefore, there is limited value in
using clastogenic effects in human lymphocytes as being
predictive of leukemic potential.
Only one study (Zhang et al., 2010b) reports increased
cytogenetic effects (aneuploidy) in cultured myeloid
progenitor cells from 10 workers exposed to formalde-
hyde (mean of 2 ppm). Zhang et  al. (2010b) report an
increased loss of chromosome 7 (monosomy 7) and gain
of chromosome 8 (trisomy 8) in exposed relative to the
unexposed control group. There are several problems,
however, with this study.
First, the study group was very small (10 exposed vs.•	
12 control) and the results were pooled. Individual
results for monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 should have
been provided so that the exact nature of aneuploidy
could have been assessed on an individual basis, and
so it would be clear whether there was a consistent
increase for all subjects, or if some were much higher
than others, or if some had just one change or both,
etc.
Second, were other chromosome changes looked•	
for and not found? Or did the authors only look for
these particular changes? It is not clear, as there is no
discussion beyond monosomy 7 and trisomy 8. This
is particularly relevant because, although aneuploidy
of chromosomes 7 and 8 have been shown to be
associated with leukemia (Johnson and Cotter, 1997;
Rowley, 2000; Paulsson and Johansson, 2007), they
arenottheonlychromosomechangesthatareassoci-
ated with the disease. In fact, as discussed in Johnson
and Cotter (1997) and Paulsson and Johansson
(2007), monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 are not likely to
be initiating events in leukemogenesis, and trisomy
8 alone is not sufficient for leukemogenesis. Trisomy
8 has been shown to occur as a secondary change to
primary inversions of other chromosomes (i.e., chro-
mosomes 9 and 11) (Paulsson and Johansson, 2007).
Third, Zhang et al. (2010b) note a high monosomy 7•	
incidence in the controls and indicate that this could
be due to artifactual chromosome loss during meta-
phase spread preparation; therefore, there is inher-
ent bias in the sampling technique that could bias
the results.
And finally, myeloid associated monosomy 7 and tri-•	
somy 8 have been shown to be correlated with other
exposures.Smokinghasbeenshowntocausetrisomy
8 (Paulsson and Johansson, 2007; Moorman, 2002),
and other occupational exposures (e.g., pesticides,
organic solvents, and petroleum compounds) have
been shown to cause monosomy 7 (Johnson and
Cotter, 1997). A recent formaldehyde occupational
exposure study (Iarmarcovai et  al., 2007), where
increased MN were observed in exposed vs. controls,
found that alcohol consumption had a potential con-
founding effect on chromosome loss. Approximately
40% of the control and exposed subjects in the Zhang
et al. (2010b) study were smokers, and about 20% in
each group consumed alcohol. Although the percent
smokers and alcohol consumers was roughly the
same in the exposed and control groups, there was
no attempt to determine the degree of smoking or
alcohol consumption among the subjects. Therefore,
potential confounding from these exposures could
have biased the results, particularly given the small
sample size. Individual data could provide more
insight into potential confounding associations.
Overall, given the small study group, lack of a thor-•	
ough examination of chromosomal effects, potential
confounding of observed effects (i.e., other potential
exposures, smoking, alcohol consumption), and
the possibility of artifactual chromosome loss dur-
ing sample preparation, it is possible to attribute
the chromosomal changes reported by Zhang et al.
(2010b) to chance.

in the blood and does not cause DNA damage and cellu-
lar transformation beyond the nasal respiratory mucosa,
in combination with the inconsistent effects observed in
PBLs of humans occupationally exposed to formalde-
hyde (likely due to confounding and lack of good form-
aldehyde exposure information), and the fact that there
is little support for the use of PBLs as a marker for effects
in HSCs and leukemia, the PBL data from formaldehyde
occupationstudies,takenasawhole,providelittle(ifany)
support for the proposed modes of action for formalde-
hyde as a leukemogen. Finally, the recent study by Zhang
et al. (2010b) is hampered by potential confounding, a
small study group, sampling artifacts, and lacks reporting
of critical information, such that the reported chromo-
some changes in this study are impossible to interpret.
Therefore, the weight of available evidence does not
support the proposed mode of action that formaldehyde
might target circulating HSCs that might then home back
to the bone marrow to cause leukemia.
6.3.2. Formaldehyde exposure would have to be very high
to induce DNA damage above endogenous levels in the
bone marrow, NALT, or circulating HSCs, and would likely be
associated with a high degree of irritation
As discussed already, there is a large body of supportive
evidence that inhalation exposure to formaldehyde at
reasonably expected concentrations for humans (less
than 2 ppm) does not result in increased blood levels of
formaldehyde (Heck and Casanova, 2004; Franks, 2005;
Andersen et  al., 2010), likely due to normal metabolic
processes that prevent formaldehyde from readily enter-
ing the circulation. Further, there is evidence to suggest
that DNA damage does not occur in the blood or bone
marrow of animals even at concentrations as high as
6–15 ppm. Schmid and Speit (2007) propose that, due
to the rapid removal of DPX, very high concentrations
of formaldehyde would be required (higher than what
would be expected for humans occupationally exposed
to formaldehyde) to produce enough DPX that would
persist until DNA replication could lead to a permanent
genotoxic effect (i.e., SCE, CA, or MN).
It is important to consider these concentrations in
the context of what concentrations of formaldehyde
are known to cause sensory irritation. Arts et al. (2006)
conducted a review of the formaldehyde respiratory irri-
tation and carcinogenicity data and found that overall,
formaldehyde sensory irritation is first observed at 1 ppm
in animals and humans, with eye and nasal irritation
occurring at concentrations ≥1 and ≥2 ppm, and throat
irritation occurring at ≥3 ppm, and more severe irritation
occurring at concentrations ≥6 ppm. Therefore, sensory
irritation occurs at concentrations well below those that
would likely be necessary to cause sufficient DNA dam-
age in blood, NALT, or bone marrow, and therefore the
formaldehyde exposure concentrations necessary to
cause such DNA damage would likely not be tolerated by
humans.
6.3.3.  Circulating HSCs may not readily home back to healthy
bone marrow to cause leukemia
A critical assumption in the proposed modes of action
that formaldehyde either targets stem cells in the NALT
or circulating in the blood is that these damaged cells
will travel back to and become incorporated into the
bone marrow where they could then cause leukemia.
Although much of the evidence suggests that these pro-
posed modes of action are not biologically plausible,
there is still a general assumption that if the exposure
conditions were such that even one cell was trans-
formed, either directly in circulating HSCs or in the
NALT and then released into the circulation, that this
cell would then readily home back to the bone marrow.
The current evidence is not clear, however, with regard
to this assumption for people with healthy bone mar-
row (McKinney-Freeman and Goodell, 2004; Abkowitz
et  al., 2003; Abrams et  al., 1980; Wright et  al., 2001;
Schulz et al., 2009), which would be the majority of the
population for which the regulatory outcome of these
studies and proposed mechanisms would seek to pro-
tect. And, in fact, a number of studies suggest that the
majority of circulating HSCs may not efficiently home
to bone marrow.
For example, using genetically marked parabiosed
CD45 congenic mice (surgically joined and sharing a
common circulation), McKinney-Freeman and Goodell
(2004) found that although there was a small percent of
partner-derived stem cells present in the bone marrow,
the majority of animals were not stably engrafted with
partner HSCs when tested for functional HSC activity,
suggesting that although a small percent of circulating
HSC can reenter the bone marrow during homeostasis
(i.e., in the absence of cytokine mobilization), this reen-
trance is transient and unstable, and functional HSCs
do not persist in the bone marrow after returning from
the circulation. The results of this study are supported by
Abkowitz et al. (2003), who also used genetically marked
parabiosed mice in a similar experiment and found simi-
lar results. These results suggest that HSC homeostasis
is primarily maintained by endogenous stem cells in the
bone marrow, and not from the return of stem cells from
the circulation. The authors propose that “[b]ecause the
HSC replication rate is high [in the bone marrow], the
new HSCs outnumber the few HSCs entering the marrow
from the peripheral blood. Once HSCs exit bone marrow,
their lifespan in the circulation is extremely short, con-
tributing to the competitive advantage of endogenously
generated cells.”
There may be additional support for the idea that
circulating HSCs do not readily home back to bone
marrow in that that there is no evidence that blood
transfusions from precancerous (leukemia) blood
donors are associated with increased risk of leukemia
in recipients (Edgren et al., 2007). It is not unreasonable
Formaldehyde as a leukemogen—Weight of evidence  613
© 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.
to assume that blood donors who were later diagnosed
with leukemia had circulating progenitor cells that had
genetic damage or were transformed. Although it would
need to be confirmed that preleukemogenic individu-
als have precancerous circulating HSCs, if preleuke-
mogenic cells did exist in a blood donation, and these
cells readily home back to bone marrow, Edgren et al.
should have seen an increased risk of leukemia in the
blood recipients, but they did not. The authors cite
other studies that were inconclusive with regard to this
question.
Thereareconflictingstudiesthatappeartosuggestthat
HSCs do efficiently home to bone marrow under homeo-
static conditions (Wright et al., 2001). A recent review by
Schulz et al. (2009), however, indicates that the mecha-
nisms involved in the control of hematopoietic stem or
progenitor cell function remain largely unknown. The
authors indicate that, in addition to recirculation to the
bone marrow, HSCs migrate to peripheral tissue during
inflammation to respond to tissue damage. Therefore, it
appears that there is much to learn with regard to mecha-
nisms involved in homing of HSCs to bone marrow under
homeostatic conditions. Consequently, the assumption
that damaged HSCs or NALT stem cells would read-
ily return to bone marrow where they could then cause
leukemia should be questioned, and further studies are
necessary to assess the extent to which this might occur
under homeostatic conditions.
Therefore, aside from the questions put forth with
regard to the implausibility that exogenous formalde-
hyde could sufficiently damage NALT stem cells or cir-
culating HSCs, there are clearly also questions regarding
the extent to which these stem cells would then migrate
back to the bone marrow. Consequently, these studies
add further to the questions regarding the plausibility of
the proposed modes of action. Moreover, it is critical that
we try to better understand HSC trafficking in and out
of bone marrow under normal physiological conditions
before accepting any mode of action that relies so heavily
on this mechanism.
6.4.  Summary
As a whole, the available formaldehyde toxicokinetic,
mode-of-action, and genotoxicity studies provide little
evidence for support of the account that formaldehyde
exposure is causally associated with leukemia. The ad
hoc assumptions that have been put forth in support of
the three proposed modes of action are not consistent
with the full body of evidence. To support the proposed
modes of action, one must assume,
with regard to targeting circulating hematopoietic1.	
stem cells, that formaldehyde can move beyond the
nasal respiratory mucosa to increase levels in the
blood to a sufficient degree that would result in carci-
nogenic initiation of progenitor cells, and the weight
of evidence does not suggest this, at least for levels
to which humans are likely to be exposed and that
could be tolerated (due to irritation at higher levels
of exposure);
with regard to targeting bone marrow, that formal-2.	
dehyde can travel in its hydrated methanediol form
to the bone marrow where it will be in equilibrium
with free formaldehyde that can cause DNA dam-
age and cellular transformation, even though this is
biologically implausible and the weight of evidence
strongly suggests that exogenous formaldehyde does
not cause DNA damage in any tissue other than the
nasal respiratory mucosa;
with regard to targeting stem cells in the NALT, that3.	
formaldehyde somehow moves beyond the nasal
respiratory mucosa and causes sufficient damage to
nasal stem cells, such that further carcinogenic man-
ifestations could occur (leukemia), without causing
any nasal lymphomas or chloromas in the nasal tis-
sue, even though it is biologically and quantitatively
implausible that the level of damage likely required
in the NALT to cause further carcinogenic manifes-
tations would not also lead to chloromas and nasal
lymphomas;

confounded by exposures to other chemicals in the
workplace or by effects from smoking or alcohol
consumption (in addition to the assumption that

for effects in HSCs and leukemia, and there is little
support for this in the literature); or

by potential confounding, a small study group,
sampling artifacts (e.g., possible artifactual chromo-
somal loss during metaphase spread preparation),
and lacks reporting of critical information, such that
the reported chromosome changes in this study are
impossible to interpret; and

formaldehyde is capable of transforming stem cells
in the NALT or circulating HSCs, that these cells will
then readily home back to the bone marrow, even
though currently there is evidence to suggest that
these cells infrequently home back to healthy bone
marrow.
 Moreover, beyond the lack of support provided by the
current mechanistic weight of evidence, as discussed,
the epidemiology data, human and animal hematotoxic-
ity data, and animal leukemia studies do not provide any
614  L. R. Rhomberg et al.
 Critical Reviews in Toxicology
support for the proposed modes of action for formalde-
hyde leukemogenesis.
It is worth pointing out an inconsistency with respect
to data that have been put forth in the context of the three
proposed modes of action for formaldehyde leukemo-
genesis. That is, reported observations of formaldehyde-
induced hematotoxicity have been generally discussed
as indicating a causal association with leukemia, and the
proposed association has been discussed in the context
of three possible modes of action. Bone marrow toxicity,
however, can only occur if the chemical interacts directly
with the bone marrow, which would only happen in the
proposed mode of action that targets bone marrow. If the
alternative modes of action are plausible (targeting circu-
latinghematopoieticstemcellsorNALTstemcells),form-
aldehyde would not be expected to cause hematotoxicity
because it would not be directly acting on bone marrow.
Instead, it likely would not be until tumor formation in
bonemarrowthatonewouldexpectachangeinbloodcell
counts (likely increase in WBCs). That is, hematotoxicity
would not be expected to occur in the exposed workers in
the Zhang et al. (2010b) study if the mode of action was
through formaldehyde damage to circulating progenitor
cells or NALT stem cells. Interestingly, there are no other
leukemogens that do not also show hematotoxicity, and
therefore these leukemogens likely act by directly dam-
aging the bone marrow. So, acceptance of one of these
two modes of action (targeting circulating HSCs or NALT
stem cells) suggests formaldehyde acts via a completely
different mechanism from other leukemogens (i.e., in the
absence of hematotoxicity), further suggesting biological
implausibility.
Finally, it is informative to consider the phenomenon
of apparent dependence of increased leukemia risk in
certain epidemiology studies on peak exposure rather
than on average or cumulative exposure. As we described
in Section 4, in the NCI industrial worker cohort, Beane
Freeman et al. (2009) found that the presence in a work-
er’s career of peak exposures >4 ppm was associated with
increased leukemia risk. In that section, we questioned
whether this dependence on peaks was merely a mat-
ter of choosing among several dose metrics considered
based on its outcome. But if the dependence on peaks
is a real effect—if it is a discovery of the epidemiology
investigations—there should be some correspondent
peak-dependent aspects evident when proposed modes
of action are investigated. It is not clear from consider-
ationofthemodesofactionthathavebeenproposedhow
such a peak dependence could work. If formaldehyde
has to leave the respiratory tract and be redistributed to
distant tissues such as marrow, the sharpness of a peak
of exposure would be greatly attenuated as the absorbed
formaldehyde mixed into the general circulation.
Similarly, if susceptible cells are to migrate from marrow
to the respiratory tract and back to the marrow, or from
NALT in the respiratory tract to the marrow—processes
that are hypothesized to be occurring at a low but ongo-
ing level—it is not clear how peak inhalation exposures
could have special effect. One would expect associations
with other measures of exposure besides peak if this were
the case. If genotoxic modes of action are proposed (so as
to form the basis for concern regarding potential cancer
risks to people experiencing low environmental expo-
sures), the accumulation of risk of transforming muta-
tions similarly must be an ongoing process that does
not readily explain the apparent dependence on peak
exposure as noted by Beane Freeman et  al. (2009). In
our view, such considerations illustrate the importance
of integrating weight of evidence across disciplines, not
just in combining conclusions from different disciplines,
and in using a hypothesis-based framework to assess the
consistency of analyses and their interpretations with
mutual illumination across disciplines.
7.  Discussion
The most current draft of the US EPA assessment of form-
aldehyde’s human health risks (US EPA, 2010) states, “[h]
uman epidemiological evidence is sufficient to conclude
a causal association between formaldehyde exposure
and … all leukemias, myeloid leukemia and lymphohe-
matopoietic cancers as a group,” but it also notes that
“[l]imited evidence from animal bioassays is available
to support the conclusion from human epidemiologic
data that formaldehyde causes some types of lymphohe-
matopoietic cancers.” As is clear from the US EPA state-
ment, these conclusions are backed by evaluations based
initially on a judgment about the human data alone, con-
ducted according to the approaches that epidemiologists
use to evaluate whether the patterns observed among
human studies of apparent associations between inhaled
formaldehyde and lymphohematopoietic cancers are,
in the judges’ view, sufficiently indicative of a causative
process. It is only afterward that the compatibility of
this conclusion with information from animal studies or
mode-of-action data is considered, and, if the human-
data-only conclusion is one of causation, the presence or
(as in the case of formaldehyde) lack of additional sup-
port is noted.
ThemostrecentupdateoftheIARCmonograph(IARC,
2009) states that, with regard to formaldehyde, “the epi-
demiological evidence on leukaemia has become stron-
ger, and new mechanistic studies support a conclusion of
sufficient evidence in humans. This highlights the value of
mechanistic studies, which in only 5 years have replaced
previous assertions of biological implausibility with new
evidence that formaldehyde can cause blood-cell abnor-
malities that are characteristic of leukaemia develop-
ment.” IARC further states that “[t]he Working Group was
almost evenly split on the evaluation of formaldehyde
causing leukaemias in humans, with the majority view-
ing the evidence as sufficient for carcinogenicity and the
minority viewing the evidence as limited. Particularly rel-
evanttothediscussionsregardingsufficientevidencewas
a recent study accepted for publication which, for the first
time, reported aneuploidy in blood of exposed workers
Formaldehyde as a leukemogen—Weight of evidence  615

characteristic of myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplas-
tic syndromes with supporting information suggesting
a decrease in the major circulating blood cell types and
in circulating haematological precursor cells.” Although
the IARC monograph highlights mechanistic studies, it
appears that “viewing the evidence as sufficient” stems
predominantly from one human occupational study
(likely Zhang et al., 2010b, although not cited by IARC,
2009).
Our concern with such a process is that it fails to
appreciate the role that animal, toxicokinetic, and
mode-of-action data can and should have, not just in
the overall conclusion, but in the interpretation of the
meaning of the epidemiological data themselves. If one
concludes that the epidemiological data show causa-
tion, then there is an implicit conclusion that some
mechanism for this causal process is not merely con-
ceivable or not yet disproven, but it must actually exist.
If it is firmly concluded that something is causal, it must
also be firmly concluded that a means for that causation
exists, even if it is not named. If animal studies or other
mode-of-action studies are not in concordance with
the human-data-only conclusion (epidemiology and
the key mechanistic occupational study referenced by
IARC), acceptance of the apparent causation in humans
necessarily includes a further conclusion that the dis-
cordance is explicable—that the causes invoked for
the human data either do not operate in animals or, for
some scientifically plausible reason, are not manifested
in observable consequences.
Our HBWoE approach calls attention to this and rec-
ognizes that the weight-of-evidence evaluation should
evaluate these subsidiary conclusions about the plau-
sibility of human mechanisms and their concordance
or lack of concordance with mechanisms in animals. It
is important to evaluate these subsidiary conclusions
explicitly rather than leave them implicit. It is particularly
important when, as is the case for formaldehyde, our
understanding of these other aspects is not merely non-
supporting of the human-data-only conclusion but actu-
ally conflicts with it. If inhaled formaldehyde is indeed
a human leukemogen, then something about what is
commonly understood, related to possible mechanisms
and their potential operation in humans and rodents, is
in error. Conversely, if it is indeed right to doubt the sci-
entific plausibility of suggested mechanisms, their opera-
tion in human exposures, and their lack of operation in
animal studies, then it is wrong to interpret the patterns
among human studies as indicative of causality. Because
the epidemologists’ evaluation of causality from the
human data entails judging how well a common causal
explanation is supported by the array of observations
compared to alternative explanations that attribute the
apparent patterns to other, non-causal influences (such
as chance and confounding), the scientific plausibility
of the causal interpretation of the human-data patterns
in view of other, non-epidemiologic data is an important
part of a sound evaluation.
We have attempted to carry out a more complete eval-
uation across scientific disciplines for the case of inhaled
formaldehyde and hematopoietic cancers in humans.
In our reading of the weight of evidence, the conclusion
that formaldehyde can cause such effects is not well
supported.
In summary, the HBWoE evaluation for formaldehyde
considers two alternative accounts. One account consists
of acceptance of the epidemiology evidence as suffi-
ciently compelling that, even in the face of weak hema-
tological and carcinogenic evidence in animals and weak
and inconsistent hematological evidence in humans,
one of the proposed modes of action for formaldehyde
leukemogenesis must be right, since its manifestations as
increased leukemia risks are seen in the human studies.
Moreover, the arguments against the biological plausibil-
ity of these modes of action must in some way be incor-
rect. Acceptance of this account is associated with many
unanswered questions and post hoc explanations for
how the current data should be interpreted as support-
ing it. This account requires that one accepts the reported
exposure and disease information in the epidemiology
studies as true, even though the lack of precise exposure
data likely led to exposure measurement error and/or
exposure misclassification that could have biased results,
and disease misclassification in these studies likely led
to unreliable risk estimates. It requires that all the many
human studies that failed to show increased leukemia
risk did so for plausible reasons, such that the lack of
effects does not contradict formaldehyde’s asserted gen-
eral property of leukemogenicity. This account requires
that one accepts an existence of an exposure-response
relationship, despite the lack of consistently observed
exposure-response associations within or among the
epidemiology studies. It requires that one accepts the
post hoc explanation of short latency for the increased
risks associated with peak exposure observed in the NCI
industrial worker cohort with follow-up through 1994,
but not when follow-up was continued through 2004,
even though this does not explain how this trend was
not observed in the NCI embalmers cohort (Hauptmann
et al., 2003; Walrath and Fraumeni, 1983, 1984) or gar-
ment workers cohort (Pinkerton et al., 2004), in whom
risks were only observed with exposures over 20 years.
This account requires that, although the epidemiology
data were statistically analyzed in many different parallel
ways with many finding no significant association, one
chooses to focus only on the few marginally significant
findings while ignoring the others as part of the evidence
as a whole. For example, in the NCI industrial worker
cohort, associations were reported with peak exposures,
but there was no a priori reason to focus on peak expo-
sures. These results should at most be treated as hypoth-
esis-generating observation to be tested empirically.
Otherwise, it is post hoc and arbitrary.
Moreover, this account (that formaldehyde is caus-
ally associated with leukemia) requires inclusion of an
explanation as to why controlled animal experiments fail
616  L. R. Rhomberg et al.
 Critical Reviews in Toxicology
to show hematological or leukemogenic effects at high
formaldehyde exposure concentrations (6 to 15 ppm).
That is, what is being argued to be happening in humans
(to allow the leukemogenic effect) must for some reason
notbehappeningintheexperimentalanimals,orelsethey
would have been seen to have parallel hematotoxic and
leukemogenic effects, as well as evidence of other conse-
quences of operation of the proposed modes of action. It
is not beyond reason that a leukemogenic effect of formal-
dehyde might be confined to humans, but there has been
no explanation offered for why this might be so. Further,
the proposed modes of action that would enable an effect
in humans do not have any evident basis to be absent in
rodents—indeed, some of the elements (migrating stem
cells, effects on NALT), both consistent with or contrary to
thisaccount,arebasedonratdata.Asitstands,thereasons
for rodents not being subject to the proposed causative
processes in humans constitutes an unstated corollary—
one without empirical support or plausible basis—to the
theories of human leukemogenesis of formaldehyde.
One needs to account for the inconsistencies among
studies regarding the hematological evidence in humans;
if there is an effect of formaldehyde inhalation, then what
reasons are proposed for why it is not seen in many of the
studies (and not seen at all in animals)? Only some of the
hypothesized modes of action entail hematotoxicity, and
so a proposal of its role in human leukemia depends on
the particular variety of proposed mode of action being
considered, with observations in favor of one mode tend-
ing to contradict other modes and hence in need of expla-
nation for why such conflicts are not refuting. Finally,
because of the weak and inconsistent epidemiological
and toxicological evidence for a causal association, this
account requires that one rely heavily on the truth of toxi-
cokineticandmechanistichypothesesthatpermitaplau-
sible biological mode of action. To accept this account as
true, one must accept that somehow formaldehyde can
move beyond the nasal respiratory mucosa to ultimately
cause DNA damage and cellular transformation in bone
marrow, circulating hematopoietic stem cells, or the
NALT, even though there is a large body of evidence to
suggest that inhaled formaldehyde (at reasonably high
exposure concentrations for humans, 2 ppm) does not
increase levels in the blood and does not cause DNA
damage in cells and tissues beyond the nasal respira-
tory mucosa to a sufficient degree that would manifest
as leukemia. If one is to conclude that formaldehyde is a
“known” human leukemogen, one must assert not only
that these hypothesized modes of action are conceivably
true but that it is indeed known that one of them is true,
for otherwise an essential and utterly necessary element
of the causal conclusion is missing.
For this account (formaldehyde is causally associated
with leukemia), there is a very large degree of ad hoc
argument. That is, the elements of this account are cho-
sen so as to fit the hypothesis already put forth, not based
purely on an evaluation of the weight of the evidence as a
whole and how it may (or may not) support the proposed
hypothesis. Consequently, alternative accounts need to
be considered.
An alternative, and contrasting, account is that it is
not possible for formaldehyde to move beyond the nasal
respiratory mucosa to cause systemic DNA damage and
cellular transformation (in the bone marrow, circulating
hematopoietic stem cells, or the NALT), and therefore
there is no biologically plausible mechanism for form-
aldehyde leukemogenesis. This is supported by a large
body of toxicokinetic and mechanistic data in animals
and in vitro, and by inconsistent cytogenetic peripheral
blood lymphocytes data in humans that are likely con-
founded by other exposures and a lack of reliable form-
aldehyde exposure information, in addition to the fact
that there is little evidence to support the use of periph-
eral blood lymphocytes data as a biomarker for effects
in hematopoietic stem cells or for leukemia. Further, the
lack of toxicokinetic and mechanistic biological plausi-
bility is supported by the largely negative toxicological
evidence and a significant number of null epidemiology
findings, which are considered under this account to be
the true results, whereas those relatively isolated and
unrepeated positive results are considered as false posi-
tives attributable to confounding by other exposures or
to chance. If this account is true, an association between
inhalation of formaldehyde and leukemia would be
understood as not plausible for humans, and the few
positive associations that have been observed would
be attributed to alternative explanations (i.e., to other
chemical exposures in the workplace, or lifestyle-related
exposures such as smoking or alcohol consumption, or
simply to chance).
In comparing these two accounts, neither is proven
or disproven, but when assessing the weight of the avail-
able evidence in support of either account, it is clear that
the first account requires far more ad hoc assumptions
and post hoc explanations. In the first account, the infer-
ences regarding potential human risk are not coming
from the data themselves, but from assumptions invoked
after the fact to fit the hypotheses put forth and without
the evidence that would tie the weak epidemiological,
toxicological, and mode-of-action data causally to form-
aldehyde inhalation exposure. Therefore, the weight of
evidence for this account (i.e., exposure to formaldehyde
in air is causally associated with leukemia in humans) is
weak in comparison to the more substantial weight of
evidence supporting the lack of a causal association.
