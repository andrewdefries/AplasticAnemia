Exceptional elevation of children's leukemia appearing 5 years after the 1983 startup of the
Krimmel nuclear power plant, accompanied by a significant increase of adult leukemia cases, led
to investigations of radiation exposures of the population living near the plant. The rate of
dicentric chromosomes in peripheral blood lymphocytes of seven parents of children with
leukemia and in 14 other inhabitants near the plant was significantly elevated and indicated
ongoing exposures over the years of its operation. These findings led to the hypothesis that
chronic reactor leakages had occurred. This assumption is supported by identification of artificial
radioactivity in air, rainwater, soil, and vegetation by the environmental monitoring program at the
nuclear power plant. Calculations of the corresponding source terms show that emissions must
have been well above authorized annual limits. Bone marrow doses supposedly result primarily
through incorporation of bone-seeking ,- and a-emitters. Environ Health Perspect 105(Suppl

Introduction
A cluster of childhood leukemia cases was
observed in the community ofElbmarsch in
northern Germany in 1989 to 1991 (1-3).
All five cases had been living within a dis-
tance of 5 km from the Kriimmel nuclear
power plant (Kernkraftwerk Krummel
[KKK]) located near the river Elbe about 35
km southeast ofHamburg. Since 1994, four
additional cases were identified in the 5-km
area surrounding KKK (Figure 1). All these
cases were diagnosed at 10 years of age or
younger; five were very young: 1.8 to 4 years
of age (Table 1). Also, one case of leukemia

in a young adult and a case of aplastic
anemia in a child were diagnosed.
Between 1986 and 1995 the mean
number of children up to the age of 14 liv-
ing in the 5-km area surrounding KKK was
about 5400 (4). According to Haaf et al.
(5), the mean incidence of acute leukemia
between 1980 and 1990 was 4.3 x 10-5 a-l
in individuals less than 15 years of age. The
expected number of leukemia cases in chil-
dren in the 5-km region around KKK for
the period 1990 to 1996 was 1.6; therefore,
the incidence ofchildhood leukemia in that
region was elevated by a factor of 5.6.
The Kriimmel nuclear power plant is a
1 300-mW boiling-water reactor-the
largest in the world-and began operation
in 1983. The nuclear research institute
Gesellschaft fur Kernenergieverwertung in
Schiffbau und Schiffahrt (GKSS) is located
in this plant's vicinity. The GKSS was
established in 1958 and operates two
research reactors of S and 15 mW.
The governments of the Federal States
of Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein
have established a board of experts to iden-
tify possible causes of the observed
leukemia cluster. Potential risk factors such
as X-rays, chemicals, and previous diseases
of the affected families were noted and
excluded from the study. None of the par-
ents were exposed to occupational or
unusual medical irradiation. One family,
however, was living in a house with a mean
radon concentration of 450 Bq/m3. The
only common factor among the leukemia
cases was their proximity to the two nuclear
establishments. With respect to KKK, not
only the spatial relationship of the observed
leukemia cluster to the nuclear power plant
is remarkable but also the temporal corre-
spondence. The first case of malignant
blood disease was diagnosed 5 years after
KKK was commissioned.
A retrospective epidemiologic study by
Hoffmann and Greiser (6) in 1994
showed an elevation in the incidence of
leukemia in the whole population in the
vicinity of KKK. For the period 1984 to
1993 there was a statistically significant ele-
vation for males (+56%) within 5 km of
the nuclear power plant. This increase was
confined to the period 1989 to 1993; it
began 5 years after the KKK startup.
A careful investigation of the possible
relationship between the cluster ofleukemia
cases and the local nuclear facilities
appeared imperative even though the
whole-body counting of inhabitants per-
formed in 1991 produced negative results
and analyses concerning the emission of
long-lived fission products failed to de-
monstrate a consistent pattern of increased
radionuclide concentrations in soil and veg-
etation (7). There were, however, several
isolated findings of elevated radionuclide
activities measured in environmental
samples at various times (8).
To examine whether the population
living in the vicinity of KKK was subjected
to elevated exposures of ionizing radiation,
analyses of dicentric chromosome aber-
rations in lymphocytes of the peripheral
blood were conducted for a group of inhabi-
tants of the Elbmarsch community. Analyses
of data on environmental radioactivity
measurements also were conducted.
Biological Dosimetry by
Investigation of Dicentric
Chromosome Aberrations
The retrospective investigation by
chromosome aberration analysis included
21 individuals (19 females and 2 males), all
inhabitants or former inhabitants of the
Elbmarsch community. All were residing
within 5 km of KKK in a southern direc-
tion. At the time the blood samples were

taken (in 1992, 1993, and 1995) these
volunteers were 28 to 45 years of age. Four
women were selected because they had set-
tled in the village after 1986 (Table 2, cases
8-11), as had one of the leukemia families
(Table 2, case 5). Seven subjects were par-
ents of the children who were diagnosed
with leukemia in Elbmarsch.
The control group consisted of 25
healthy adults (9 females and 16 males)
living in the city of Bremen, about 100 km
southwest of Hamburg. At the time of
blood sampling (1988 to 1994) these
individuals were 17 to 57 years ofage.
Each subject completed a detailed
questionnaire. Exclusion criteria were previ-
ous occupational exposures, greater-than-
average diagnostic medical irradiation, or
exposure to chemical mutagens. Smokers
(those who smoked more than 10 cigarettes
per day) were also excluded.
To evaluate the rate of dicentric
chromosomes and centric ring chromo-
somes, lymphocyte cultures and slide
preparations were made according to
standard cell cycle controlling methods
(9). Collection of metaphases was facili-
tated by a semiautomatic computerized
system that included data management
(Metasystems, Sandhausen, Germany).
Only first-division metaphases with 46
centromeres were analyzed and all struc-
tural aberrations were registered. The
results are given in Table 2.
Compared to the laboratory control
(0.46 x 10-3), the investigated population of
Elbmarsch showed a highly significant
elevation of dicentric chromosomes, with a
rate of 1.77x 10-3 dicentric chromo-
somes/metaphase [p< 0.01 (10)]. The high-
est individual number of dicentrics
(excluding case 3 in Table 2) was 5 dicentric
chromosomes in 1000 metaphases.
Particularly noteworthy was the existence
ofcells with two dicentrics in the Elbmarsch
group (Table 2, cases 5, 8, 10, and 12) in
contrast to the control group (no cells with
more than one dicentric). Additionally,
there was one metaphase with six dicentrics
(Table 2, case 3). The aberrations did not
follow Poisson distribution but showed a
significant overdispersion (11). This was
true for the entire Elbmarsch population
investigated, even when the multiaberrant
cell was excluded (Table 3). Although the
results of the chromosome aberration analy-
sis indicate that the population of the
Elbmarsch community has been severely
exposed to ionizing radiation in the past
(12), extrapolation of the entire accumu-
lated dose is not adequate because exposure
conditions are not known.
Gamma Dose in the
Surrounding Area
The major focus of the environmental
monitoring program of KKK and GKSS is
y dose rate and accumulated y dose
(7,8,13,14). The annual external 'y dose is
controlled by 80 thermoluminescence
dosimeter(s) (TLD) distributed at different
locations (13). We analyzed the results by
regarding two zones: 0 to 2.5 km (a total of
11 locations excluding measurements at the
KKK site) and 7.5 to 15 km (34 dosime-
ters). By calculating annual averages for
each of the zones it was determined that
there was systematic elevation of'y exposure
in the internal zone since the beginning of
operation in 1983 to about 1992 (Figure
2). In the 2 years before the KKK startup
the external y doses in the two zones were
statistically similar.
The difference in y exposures corre-
sponds to a mean additional exposure of

0.09 mSv per year and cannot be explained
by small-scale spatial variation of the back-
ground external y radiation field. Although
the y exposure rate is well below the German
permissible limit of 0.3 mSv per year, the
influence of the reactor operation is well
demonstrated. This result is remarkable
because a safety assessment report (15) pre-
dicted a possible maximum reactor dose of
only 0.04 mSv per year. This dose would be
incurred partly by inhalation and ingestion
of radionuclides, which are not registered by
TLD dosimetry.
Cesium Isotopes
in Rainwater and Air
Long-lived y emitters are routinely
measured in the vicinity of KKK (13,14).
Concentrations in rainwater are measured
periodically at three locations. Figure 3
shows 137Cs activity in precipitation at these
sampling stations. The Grunhof station,
which is 2.2 km downwind of KKK, has
shown a decreasing but permanent elevation
of isotopes 134Cs and 137Cs since 1986.
These isotopes were elevated compared to
isotope incidence at other locations of the
KKK monitoring program and the 137cs
concentration was at least 10-fold higher
than that at other measuring points in north-
ern Germany from the third quarter of 1986
until 1993 (16). Thus, Chernobyl fallout
can be excluded as a cause ofsuch elevations.
In addition, the presence of the 134Cs iso-
tope in these samples indicates that the cont-
aminations cannot be attributed to the
fallout from nuclear weapons testing because
ofthe short half-life of134Cs (2.1 years).
Calculations and measurements demon-
strate that the releases of radioactivity
permitted by German nuclear facilities do
not lead to detectable contamination in the
surrounding areas (17). Therefore, find-
ings of Cs in rainwater appear to be an
indication of repeated releases of nuclides
above permitted limits.
Elevated Cs emissions have been
confirmed by measurements of dry fallout
at different locations near KKK (13).
Compared to that in other locations in
Germany, the 137Cs aerosol concentration
in air near the grou4nd in the vicinity of
KKK was significantly elevated in different
quarters in the period 1985 to 1995 (Table
4). It should be noted that these measure-
ments were carried out by three different
laboratories; therefore, repeated measure-
ment errors can be discounted. Addition-
ally, remarkable concentrations of 90Sr
were found in 1984 and 1988, which also
cannot be explained by any other sources
than KKK emissions (90Sr in rainwater was
not measured).
Fission and Activation
Products in Soils and
Green Plants
Measurements of environmental samples
show elevated activities of the nuclides
'37Cs and 90Sr in soil and plants since the
startup of KKK (13,14). The Chernobyl
accident led to only marginal increases of
90Sr in the German environment (17).
Nevertheless, concentrations of this isotope
rose repeatedly by several Bq/kg (dry mass)
compared to the background fallout in
the grass around KKK. The highest 90Sr
contamination-30 Bq/kg (dry mass)-was
registered in August 1987 at a location 10
km from KKK; this is more than 10-fold
the normal concentration in Germany at
that time (18,19).The highest concentra-
tion of 137Cs in grass (103 Bq/kg) was mea-
sured in 1988 2 km from KKK (13). This
is an approximately 100-fold increase over
the normal value in local vegetation (19).
The KKK environmental monitoring
program does not call for nuclide-specific
and continuous measurements of pure
5-and a-emitters in the controlled media
except for 90Sr in the air. Measurements of
short-lived y and 5-emitters are also not
required. Nevertheless, there have been
occasional findings of short-lived fission
and activation products as well as radio-
active corrosion products, none of which
can be explained by the Chernobyl acci-
dent (Table 5). Only after damage to
the fuel rods would these nuclides be
detectable outside the plant. In these cases
leakages ofprimary cooling water would be

accompanied by releases of Pu and other
transuranium isotopes (20).
In 1984 Pu isotopes were found in
surface water of the Elbe River and in fish
in the river (8). When the activity ratios of
isotopes 238pu and 2391240Pu are compared,
it is concluded that they were generated in
a reactor and are not the result ofweapons
fallout. No Pu measurements were avail-
able after 1984. A further indication of Pu
releases is in the discovery of 239Np in soil
in 1993 because 239Np is a precursor of
239Pu (Table 5).
Discussion
Elevated rates of leukemia among popu-
lations in the vicinity of nuclear estab-
lishments have been found repeatedly
(21-23). For example, in the case of the
Pilgrim nuclear reactor in Massachusetts, a
correlation between the leukemia rates in
the vicinity of the plant and official infor-
mation on releases of radioactivity was
established and a cause-effect relationship
derived (24). In western Germany, an inci-
dence study of childhood leukemia near
nuclear establishments in the former coun-
tries of the Federal Republic had negative
results (25). However, with respect to pop-
ulations residing in a radius of less than 5
km from a nuclear establishment and chil-
dren less than 5 years of age at diagnosis,
there was a 3-fold significant elevation in
leukemia incidence compared to that in
control regions (25).
The study by Keller and co-workers
(25) was restricted to the period 1980 to
1990; therefore, most of the cases of child-
hood leukemia near KKK were not
included. Most ofthese children became ill
at very young ages (Table 1). The hypothe-
sis of radiation induction is thus supported
by the well-known fact that individuals in
the prenatal stage and at very young ages
have a higher sensitivity to radiation.
Furthermore, the predominance ofillnesses
among boys (Table 1) corresponds to the
findings among A-bomb survivors in which
the male:female ratio is 2:1 for radiation-
induced cases (26); the normal ratio for
such illnesses is 1.3:1 (5).
Further support for the hypothesis of
radiation-induced leukemia in the
Elbmarsch region has been found through
investigations of the latency periods for
leukemia in exposed cohorts. Children 0 to
15 years of age receiving X-ray therapy for
ringworm of the scalp showed a maximum
rate ofleukemia about 4 years after irradia-
tion; 50% ofall cases occurred by this time
(27,28). This corresponds to the distribu-
tion in the Oxford Survey of Childhood
Cancers for leukemia after prenatal expo-
sure to diagnostic X-rays (29), and to age
correlations in latent cases of radiation-
induced illnesses among Japanese A-bomb
survivors (30).
Assuming 4 years oflatency and realizing
that the first appearance of childhood
leukemia in the proximity of KKK was in
1990 (Table 1), a single exposure event in

about 1986 could be suspected. However,
the ongoing occurrence of malignancies in
Elbmarsch points to continuous contami-
nation and/or incorporation ofradioactivity
with a long biological half-life.
From the medical and biological findings
discussed in this paper, we conclude that the
population was affected by repeated expo-
sures for the following reasons. First, at least
four ofthe children with leukemia were born
after 1987 (Table 1). Second, the repeated
exposures are indicated by the results of the
chromosome aberration analysis. Dicentric
chromosomes are unstable aberrations with a
decline of about 40%/year (12). Therefore,
backdating the measured rates of dicentric
chromosomes to a single event in 1986 or
earlier would yield unrealistically high origi-
nal rates ofexposure. Third, the elevated rate
of dicentric chromosomes is similar for per-
sons who settled in Elbmarsch both before
and after 1986 (Table 2).
Dose estimations based on the observed
rate of dicentric chromosomes in Elbmarsch
inhabitants are not reliable because neither
the time nor the conditions surrounding
the exposures are known. The findings
about overdispersion of the distribution of
aberrations per cell, however, give additional
information about the kind of exposure.
Overdispersion of dicentric chromosomes
can be caused by either nonuniform or high
linear energy transfer (LET) irradiation.
Such distributions have been found in
blood samples of persons occupationally
exposed to plutonium (31), tritium (32),
or uranium (33). This cannot be proven
through available data or measurements for
the Elbmarsch population. The overdis-
persion observed in the present study also is
unexplainable by external y irradiation or
other kinds oflow-dose low LET exposure.
The supervising ministry in Schleswig-
Holstein has denied that KKK is responsi-
ble for exposing the population in the
vicinity of the plant and refers to the
results ofthe extensive y monitoring of the
surrounding area. Although there is no
indication of a severe overexposure to
external y irradiation in that region, the
supposed bone marrow dose may have
been a result of incorporation of a- and
P-aerosols, whereas the y submersion was
negligible. Scenarios that lead to such
organ doses are described in connection
with accidents caused by cooling water
effluent (20). In addition, fuel-rod failures
are a well-known problem in nuclear reac-
tors. Because it has the largest boiling-
water reactor in the world, the Kriimmel
nuclear power plant is a unique installa-
tion. A recent television documentary
reported severe problems encountered dur-
ing construction ofthe pressure vessel with
regard to the welding of single elements.
The leukemia study researchers learned of
significant leakages of cooling media from
the pressurized system during almost all
the years ofoperation (34). The quantities
rose to 300 liters/hr in 1986 and increased
to more than 200 liters/hr in 1993 and
1996. Further investigations will consider
the relevance ofthese leakages by analyzing
the pattern of observed nuclides in the
areas surrounding KKK.
