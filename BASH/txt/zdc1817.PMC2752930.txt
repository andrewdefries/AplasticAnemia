OBJECTIVE — After an initially successful islet cell transplantation, a number of patients
return to C-peptide negativity, and therefore immunosuppressive therapy is discontinued. Some
are then found to have developed Graves disease. We examined the risk of Graves disease after
immunosuppression.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Immunosuppressive therapy was stopped in
13 type 1 diabetic islet cell recipients who had received one course of antithymocyte globulin and
maintenance doses of mycophenolate mofetil and a calcineurin inhibitor. None had a history of
thyroid disease.
RESULTS — In four patients, clinical Graves hyperthyroidism was observed within 21
months after discontinuation and 30–71 months after the start of immunosuppressive therapy.
All four patients exhibited a pretransplant positivity for thyroid peroxidase (TPO) autoantibod-
ies, while the nine others were TPO negative pre- and posttransplantation.
CONCLUSIONS — Type 1 diabetic recipients of islet cell grafts with pretransplant TPO
autoantibody positivity exhibit a high risk for developing Graves hyperthyroidism after immu-
nosuppressive therapy is discontinued for a failing graft.

slet cell transplantation has been
shown to reproducibly achieve meta-
bolic correction in nonuremic type 1
diabetic patients (1,2). However, in the
years following transplantation, several of
them return to C-peptide negativity and
thus to a discontinuation of their immu-
nosuppressive therapy (2).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS — Between 1999 and
2002, 17 type 1 diabetic patients (median
age 43 years [range 25–56]) received an
islet cell graft under one course of antithy-
mocyte globulin (ATG-Fresenius) and
maintenance therapy with mycopheno-
late mofetil (MMF) plus cyclosporine
(n ϭ 9) or tacrolimus (n ϭ 8). In 13 of the
patients, immunosuppressive therapy
was stopped (calcineurin inhibitor ﬁrst)
6–66 months later because plasma C-
peptide levels had dropped under 0.2 ng/
dl. They were further monitored for side
effects from the intervention protocol.
In terms of autoimmune status, HLA-
DQA1-DQB1 and DR3 genotypes and
single nucleotide polymorphisms were
determined to be susceptibility markers
(3, rev. in 4), lymphocytes were pheno-
typed (5), and autoantibodies (islet cell
antibody, insulin antibody, GAD anti-
body, insulinoma antigen 2 antibody)
were measured (6).
Data are presented as median (range).
For comparison of patient subgroups, the
Mann-Whitney U test was used for quan-
titative variables and the Fisher’s exact
test was used for binary variables. Differ-
ences were considered signiﬁcant for P Ͻ
0.05.
RESULTS — Clinical Graves disease
was diagnosed in 4 of 13 subjects (31%)
at 2–21 months after withdrawal of im-
munosuppressants and 30–71 months
after transplantation. Diagnosis was con-
ﬁrmed by suppressed thyrotropin (TSH)
levels (Ͻ0.01 mIU/l), elevated free thy-
roxin (20.4–67.7 ng/l; normal 9.3–17.0)
and free 3,5,3Ј-triiodothyronine (6.3–
16.9 ng/l; normal 2.6–4.4) levels, and pos-
itivity for thyrotropin receptor (TSHR)
autoantibodies (3.2–23.8 units/l; normal
Ͻ1). All the patients exhibited a diffusely
increased thyroid technetium-99 uptake
(5–17%; normal 1–5).
No differences in pretransplant char-
acteristics were noticed among the four
Graves-positive and the nine Graves-
negative patients except that all the
Graves-positive patients and none of the
others were positive for thyroid peroxi-
dase (TPO) autoantibodies (P ϭ 0.001)
(Table 1). The Graves-positive patients
also tended to be more polymorphic in
the protein tyrosine phosphatase nonre-
ceptor type 22 (PTPN22) susceptibility
gene (three of four vs. one of nine pa-
tients, P ϭ 0.051). There were no differ-
ences in age, sex, smoking habits, TSH
before transplantation, iodide deﬁciency
status, duration of diabetes, and presence
of diabetes-related autoantibodies (data
not shown).
The respective doses of immunosup-
pressants were similar among the Graves-
positive and Graves-negative patients:

mg/kg [range 24.0–27.0] vs. 24.3 mg/kg
[22.0–30.0], P ϭ 0.64), trough levels of
tacrolimus (median 4.5 ng/dl [4.0–6.5]
vs. 6.0 ng/dl [4.1–6.6], P ϭ 0.54) and
cyclosporine (133 ␮g/l [114–153] vs.
143 ␮g/l [112–165], P ϭ 0.69), and daily
MMF doses (2.0 g/day [1.0–2.0] vs. 2.0
g/day [1.5–2.0], P ϭ 1.00).
T-cell counts were similar before
transplantation but tended to be lower in
the pre-Graves patients during immuno-
suppressive therapy; this was particularly
reﬂected in the CD4ϩ subset counts at 3
months posttransplantation (PT) (93
mm3
[60–167] vs. 154 mm3
[43–417],
P ϭ 0.06) and at 9 months PT (152 mm3
[98–196] vs. 285 mm3
[134–516], P ϭ
0.06).
During immunosuppressive therapy,
the four TPO autoantibody–positive pa-
tients became TPO autoantibody negative
and remained so (Table 1). When it was
discontinued, TPO autoantibodies reap-
peared in all four patients with detection
at 2 and 14 months after stopping the cal-
cineurin inhibitor (Table 1). In addition,
TSHR autoantibodies also appeared in
these patients between 2 and 11 months
after stopping the calcineurin inhibitor.
Of the nine patients that were TPO auto-
antibody negative before transplantation,
none became positive for TPO or TSHR
autoantibodies during a 28- to 85-month
follow-up period after discontinuation of
the immunosuppressants. All Graves-
positive patients also exhibited increases
in one or more diabetes-related autoanti-
bodies after drug withdrawal, but this was
also the case in six of nine Graves-negative
patients (P ϭ 0.49).
CONCLUSIONS — We report the
development of Graves hyperthyroidism
in four type 1 diabetic patients in whom
immunosuppressive therapy had been
stopped 2–21 months earlier for a failing
islet cell graft. These four patients exhib-
ited a pretransplant positivity for TPO
autoantibodies without clinical or bio-
chemical signs of thyroid disease. Among
the nine recipients who were negative for
TPO autoantibodies pretransplantation,
none developed Graves hyperthyroidism.
TPO seropositivity has been associated
with an increased risk for autoimmune
hypothyroidism (7) and is present in 60–
70% of patients with Graves hyperthy-
roidism. In type 1 diabetic patients, TPO
autoantibodies were found in 30% of pa-
tients, but Graves hyperthyroidism was
found in only 1–2% (8,9). We now ob-
serve that the presence of TPO autoanti-
bodies in type 1 diabetic patients might be
predictive for their susceptibility of devel-
oping Graves hyperthyroidism after tran-
sient immunosuppressive therapy, at least
for an islet cell transplant protocol.
Immunosuppressive therapy de-
creased TPO autoantibody titers under
detection levels. Its discontinuation re-
sulted within 21 months with the reap-
pearance of TPO autoantibodies, as well
as an appearance of TSHR autoantibodies
and clinical signs of hyperthyroidism. We
hypothesize that the drug-induced lym-
phopenia in patients with previously ex-
isting occult autoimmune thyroiditis
predisposes to a reactivation of autoim-
mune mechanisms when T-cells are re-
populated and thus to an aberrant
immune reconstitution. Depletion of T-
cells has been found previously to be as-
sociated with a higher risk for Graves
disease (10) in patients receiving ATG for
aplastic anemia (11) or anti-CD52 mono-
clonal antibody for multiple sclerosis
(12). The profound decrease in CD4ϩ
lymphocytes in HIV patients is also con-
sidered to predispose for autoimmune
syndromes when the T-cell compartment
is reconstituted after antiretroviral ther-
apy (13).
In our patients, the ATG-induced
lymphopenia and subsequent repopula-
tion of T-cells may have altered the im-
mune state leading to an autoreactivity
against thyrocyte antigens such as TSHR.
In this respect, the higher frequency of
polymorphisms in the PTPN22 suscepti-
bility gene is of interest because it may
predispose to the formation of autoreac-
tive lymphocytes (14). The administra-
tion of the calcineurin inhibitor and of
MMF probably suppressed the autoreac-
tivity induced by ATG and its lymphocyte
depletion. This is in line with data show-
ing that calcineurin inhibitors efﬁciently
inhibit functions of CD4ϩ memory phe-
notype cells (15). Future studies should
examine whether slower tapering of the
immunosuppressive agents can avoid de-
velopment of pathogenic autoimmune ac-
tivities in TPO autoantibody–positive
recipients. The use of lower cumulative
doses of ATG should also be considered in
TPO autoantibody–positive patients, as
they would lead to a less pronounced and
shorter T-cell depletion.
