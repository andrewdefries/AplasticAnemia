Abstract
Background: A new chimerism analysis based on automated interphase fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) evaluation was established to detect residual cells after allogene sex-
mismatched bone marrow or blood stem-cell transplantation.
Cells of 58 patients were characterized as disease-associated due to presence of a bcr/abl-gene-
fusion or a trisomy 8 and/or a simultaneous hybridization of gonosome-specific centromeric
probes. The automatic slide scanning platform Metafer with its module MetaCyte was used to
analyse 3,000 cells per sample.
Results: Overall 454 assays of 58 patients were analyzed. 13 of 58 patients showed residual
recipient cells at one stage of more than 4% and 12 of 58 showed residual recipient cells less than
4%, respectively. As to be expected, patients of the latter group were associated with a higher
survival rate (48 vs. 34 month). In only two of seven patients with disease-marker positive residual
cells between 0.1–1.3% a relapse was observed. Besides, disease-marker negative residual cells
were found in two patients without relapse at a rate of 2.8% and 3.3%, respectively.
Conclusion: The definite origin and meaning of disease-marker negative residual cells is still
unclear. Overall, with the presented automatic chimerism analysis of interphase FISH slides, a
sensitive method for detection of disease-marker positive residual cells is on hand.

Background
Malignant hematological diseases represent 5.5% of all
cancers in Germany [1]. One way to cure these fatal dis-
eases is allogenic bone marrow or blood stem cell trans-
plantation. In case of a male donor and female recipient
(and vice versa) we talk of a sex-mismatched transplanta-
tion. In such a setting it is relatively simple to classifiy
donor and acceptor cells in the bone marrow or blood cell
system. The existence of 100 percent donor cells is called
complete chimerism, in contrast a mixture of both donor
and acceptor cells mixed chimerism. Chimerism analysis
is done on these sex-mismatched transplants to monitor
minimal residual disease and to plan further immuno-
therapy like donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) [2]. In rou-
tine diagnostics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
is frequently applied for chimerism analysis [3-6], which
demands manual time-consuming counting of cells. An
experienced technician needs about 2.5 hours for approx-
imately 3,000 cells. Therefore, an automatic FISH chimer-
ism analysis is extremely valuable for diagnostics and
correct treatment of affected patients, as it can be carried
out in a fraction of time. Thus, the presented single cell
based approach becomes now competitive in comparison
to PCR based chimerism analysis [7].
Frequently observed disease-markers are the bcr/abl-
fusion-gene as present in more than 95% of chronic mye-
loid leukemia (CML) cases [8,9], and trisomy 8 found in
11% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [10]. The simulta-
neous detection of the gonosomal constitution and a
tumor marker enables the identification of residual tumor
cells. The latter was already proposed 1994 by Nagler and
coworkers [11], however, it was not often carried out
before [12-14], and not studied under routine conditions.
Here we tested an automated interphase FISH analysis for
the characterization of chimerism in 58 patients after all-
ogenic stem cell transplantation with different hemato-
logical malignancies.
Results
Determination of cut off levels
FISH-analysis of residual cells after sex-mismatched trans-
plantation is mainly based on simultaneous labeling of
the centromeres of the X- and Y-chromosomes. Because of
possible false positive and false negative results e.g. due to
background or hybridization problems, it was necessary
to determine the cut off level. Therefore, a total of 26,633
cells from 10 healthy female and 35,783 cells from 11
healthy male were analyzed with the described automated
system. The automated analysis showed in the female
controls 257 cells with apparent male signal constellation
(XY), and the male controls had 142 cells with apparent
female signal constellation (XX). To control these auto-
mated results we investigated all questionable cells; only
38 out of 257 and 27 out of 142 could be confirmed to be
real XY-positive cells or in the male case XX-positive cells.
This corresponds to a false positive rate of 0.14% in
female and 0.08% in male. An additional random control
of 4,841 XX cells in female and of 4,535 XY cells in male
showed that there was no further failure of automatic
counting.
As the cut off level depends on the amount of analyzed
cells, all mentioned female and male cells were listed in
spreadsheets with random order and arranged in blocks of
50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1,500, 2,000, 2,500, 3,000 and
4,000 cells. Subsequently, the mean and standard devia-
tion was assessed for each block. The cut off level was
defined as the mean plus twice the standard deviation.
The respective cut of levels for each block size were fitted
by a trend line enabling the calculation of cut off levels for
arbitrary cell numbers up to 4000. Fig. 1 shows the deter-
mined/calculated cut off values for female and male cells
including trend lines.
In order to determine the false positive rate for trisomy 8
another 15,882 cells from 5 healthy people were analyzed
with centromere 8 probes. The mean false positive rate
was 1.2%. In the same manner 11,453 cells of 11 healthy
controls were investigated using the LSI-probe against the
bcr/abl-fusion gene. The mean false positive rate for the
bcr/abl-probe was 0.7%. For estimating the cut off level
for XX/XY in combination with trisomy 8 (XX or XY+tri-
somy 8) or bcr/abl (XX or XY+bcr/abl) the 95-quantil with
the following formula was used:
Thus, the cut off level was as follows:
• for XX+trisomy 8 and XX+bcr/abl = 0.005%

• for XY+trisomy 8 and XY+bcr/abl = 0.003%.
Minimum number of cells to be analyzed in a blood sample
Two statistical aspects of the present study were further
assessed. First, the minimum number of cells to be ana-
lyzed was determined in order to achieve a predefined
accuracy for the estimated fraction of acceptor cells in the
total blood of the patient.
Given the total blood of a transplanted patient consists of
N cells of which NA are acceptor cells, the fraction of
acceptor cells in the patient is PA = NA/N. A blood sample
contains fewer than N cells and the fraction of acceptor
cells in the sample pA can only be an estimate for the true
fraction PA. But how many cells must be analyzed in a
blood sample in order to achieve a predefined accuracy?
The probability of finding MA acceptor cells in a blood
sample of size M drawn from a total of N blood cells of
which NA are acceptor cells is given by a hypergeometric
distribution. However, the sample size M is generally
much smaller than the total number of cells N. Thus, the
true fraction of acceptor cells PA can be assumed to be the
same before and after the blood sample has been drawn
from the patient. The hypergeometric distribution is then
well approximated by the binomial distribution
. In the
present case the exact value of PA = NA/N is unknown but
is to be estimated by the sample ratio pA = MA/M. The
mean and standard deviation of the random variable pA
are given by , respectively. For determin-
ing the minimal number of cells to be analyzed in a blood
sample we use the order of magnitude estimate PA = 0.01
according to the measurements. The coefficient of varia-
tion (equivalent to the relative standard deviation given in
%) is then given by the ratio of standard deviation and
mean . For the relative standard devia-
tion to be smaller than q the sample size must exceed M*
= 99/q2. Hence, for q = {100%, 50%, 25%} the required
sample sizes must be larger then M* = {99, 396, 1584},
respectively.
Error bounds for the fraction of acceptor cells due to
classification errors of the automated cell recognition
device
Second statistical aspect, the error bounds for the fraction
of acceptor cells in the blood sample were calculated with
respect to classification errors introduced by the auto-
mated cell recognition device. The measured number of
acceptor cells may not reflect the real number of acceptor
cells in the sample due to measurement errors of the auto-
mated device. In order to assess the error rate of the device
we classified 10 and 11 samples from healthy females and
males, respectively, and obtained histograms for the frac-
tion of misclassified cells. These were similar for females
and males and thus pooled in a single distribution as
shown in Fig. 2. Using this error distribution we calcu-
lated the probability density function for the true number
of acceptor cells in the sample as described in the follow-
ing paragraph. The resulting probability density function
indicates that the measurements rather overestimate the
number of true acceptor states.
Probability density function for the true number of
acceptor cells in the sample
In order to assess the error introduced by the measuring
device we calculated the probability distribution
for the true number of acceptor cells MA in
the sample given the number of measured acceptor cells
M*A. First note that for a given misclassification probabil-
ity b the number of correctly measured acceptor cells
M*AA is binomial distributed with total number of cells
MA and probability 1-b. Accordingly, the number of

is binomial distributed with total number of cells MD and
probability b. As shown in Fig. 2 the misclassification
probability b itself is β-distributed. Thus, b-averaged bino-
mial probability distributions are obtained by integration
according to the β-distribution, i.e.
The probability of measuring M*A acceptor cells condi-
tional on the fact that MA true acceptor cells are present in
the sample is given by the sum of probabilities consistent
with the conditions M*A = M*AA + M*AD and M = MA + MD.
It reads
in which the product is implied by the fact that
the events 'M*AA out of MA' and 'M*AD (= M*A - M*AA) out
of MD (= M - MA)' are independent and must occur at the
same time. The probability for the true number of accep-
tor cells MA in the sample conditional on M*A acceptor
cells having been measured is given according to Bayes'
theorem
From the pooled experimental data the a priory probabil-
ity for the number of measured acceptor cells
was estimated to be a sum of two exponentials. In the
present medical context the prior for the number of accep-
tor cells in the sample fM(MA) is best chosen to be unin-
formative (i.e. constant) in order not to bias the results
towards low MA values, which would conflict with the
interest of the patient. Another choice would be to equate
. Since is strongly peaked for
zero measured acceptor cells the resulting
is biased towards low MA-values, especially for small sam-
ple sizes M. This choice could be more interesting for e.g.
insurance companies.
Sample plots of the conditional probability distribution
are shown in Fig. 3 for the empirical prior.

From these plots it becomes clear that the number of
acceptor cells is rather overestimated by the measure-
ments since the great majority of cells are donor cells that
are occasionally classified as acceptor cells. The opposite
case, i.e. acceptor cells being classified as donor cells, is
very rare simply because there are only very few acceptor
cells.
Quantification and characterization of residual cells in
patients after sex-mismatched transplantation
Overall 454 samples of 58 patients were investigated with
X- and Y-chromosome specific probes as described in
detail in Tab. 1. 33 patients had a complete chimerism
(posttransplant 290 samples) and therefore no residual
cancer cells. 25 had a mixed chimerism (47 of 163 post-
transplant samples). In order to see the clinical relevance
of residual cells, patients with mixed chimerism were
divided in two groups, one with less than 4% sexmis-
match to the donor (13 patients) and the other with more
than or equal 4% sexmismatch (12 patients). Both groups
show no correlation with the time since transplantation.
Patients with < 4% residual cells were transplanted
between 10–55 years (median = 46), patients with ≥ 4%
residual cells between 0–66 years (median = 49).
Patients after dose reduced conditioning treatment prior
to transplantation (RC) showed a tendency to develop ≥
4% residual cells whereas in myeloablative repertoire
regimes (MRR) patients trend to develop < 4% residual
cells. In detail 54% of patients with ≥ 4% residual cells
underwent MRR and 38% RC conditioning. In contrast,
25% of patients with ≥ 4% residual cells underwent MRR
and 67% RC conditioning. The survival rate of all three
groups (complete chimerism, < 4% residual cells and ≥
4%) is shown as a Kaplan-Meier-plot in Fig. 4. For a
detailed compilation of causes of death see in Table 1.
In 12 patients cytogenetic disease-markers were detected
before transplantation (bcr/abl-fusion (n = 9); trisomy 8
(n = 3)). For these cases a simultaneous hybridization of
the centromeres X and Y together with the bcr/abl- or cen-
tromere 8-probe was performed. As shown above it is pos-
sible to decrease the cut off level for acceptor cells by
targeting gonosomes and tumour specific genome altera-
tions in a single hybridization. 55 samples of twelve
patients were investigated. In nine of these samples resid-
ual cells were found in a range of 0.1–3.3%. In two of
those nine patients (cases 3, 14) the detected sexmismatch
cells were not disease-marker positive, whereas in the
other seven patients (cases 29, 31, 35, 36, 37, 41, 45) dis-
ease-marker positive residual cells were detected (in total
25 cells). Two specimen of disease-marker negative and
disease-marker positive residual cells are shown in Fig. 5.
In these remaining groups with small numbers of patients
the disease-marker gave no additional information. The
amount of disease-marker-positive or negative residual
cells showed no correlation with clinical outcome like
relapse or death. Table 2 shows the course of 9 patients
with residual cells with known disease-marker.
Discussion
Advantage of automatic scanning system "Metafer"
Chimerism analysis after sex-mismatched bone marrow
or peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation is an impor-
tant diagnostic component to monitor transplantation
and minimal residual disease and DLI [15-17]. The FISH
technique progresses in importance but demands high
personnel skills and costs. An automatic chimerism anal-
ysis system could be the solution for that dilemma and
was evaluated here. As advantage of automatic analysis
using Metafer turned out, that the picture and the coordi-
nates of each cell are memorized. Via basing points it is
possible to relocate each cell for further investigation.
Moreover, it is possible to analyze huge amounts of cells
and to detect small subpopulations of residual cells. Auto-
matic analysis correlates linearly with manual analysis (R2
= 0.985) [18]. This permits to compare automatic and
manual chimerism analysis. Because of the small fraction
of the targeted cells in the whole population one should
analyze in future studies more than 1600 cells for a rea-
sonable precision (rel. standard deviation of 25%) as
described in the statistical part.
FISH vs. PCR
Comparing FISH and PCR in chimerism analysis it was
shown that the results are in concordance [7]. The sensi-
tivity of PCR is between 3–5% and allows only semiquan-
titative analysis [4,19] whereas FISH is more sensitive
(1%) and is absolutely quantitative [20]. Because of the
different sensitivities it is recommended to use just one
method [21], in patients with complete chimerism the
method with the highest sensitivity should be used for
early detection of residual cells [17,22].
Evaluation of cut off levels and possible source of error
For cut off levels in XY-FISH-analysis it could be shown
that they depend on the sum of evaluated cells per sample
(e.g. 3,000 counted cells: cut off 1.2% and 0.6% respec-
tively – see Fig. 3. Trakhtenbrot and coworkers [23]
described a very alike cut off level in female cells.
In women with sons, male cells could be found 27 [24] or
38 years [25] postpartum in blood samples. The authors
showed that up to 40.000 male cells could be trans-
planted in a normal PBSCT by female donors. In case
male cells were found in patients after transplantation this
would be incorrectly interpreted as residual cells. There-
fore, listing of female donors with sons is recommended

in anamnesis and should be considered in chimerism
analysis. Unfortunately, this information was not availa-
ble for the investigated patients.
In the present study in two samples residual cells were
arranged in conglomerates (patient 36, in sample 20 and
26 month after transplantation). The histological origin
of these cells was not investigated. Potentially these cells
resembled endothelial cells that derived from injury of the
endothelium. To prevent contamination with endothelial
cells samples from the third aspiration of a single venous
puncture is recommended for the cytogenetic analysis.
The false positive rate of 1.2% for trisomy 8 we deter-
mined was in concordance with Jenkins et al. [26] and
Cuneo et al. [27]. The bcr/abl-false positive rate of 0.7%
was identical with Amiel et al. [28], Van den Berg et al.
[29] and Mühlmann et al. [30]. However, overall a big var-
iation can be found in the literature concering false posi-
tive rate of bcr/abl which is given between 2–10% [20,31-
34]. Possible reasons for these differences could be: 1) dif-
ferent tissue samples (bone marrow vs. peripheral blood),
2) different cell cycle stage (G1, G2) or 3) different chro-
matin structure in healthy and moribund cells [35] and 4)
different probes. With 95-quantil the cut off level for
simultaneous hybridization of gonosomes and disease-
markers were estimated and represent 0.005% in XX+tri-
somy 8/XX+bcr/abl and 0.003% in XY+trisomy 8/XY+bcr/
abl. This allows detecting one disease-marker positive
residual cell in 20.000 analyzed cells which was claimed
already in 1994 [36]. PCR as alternative diagnostic
method does not have this high sensitivity.
Automatic scanning applied on sex-mismatched patients
33 patients out of 58 had a complete chimerism, 13
patients residual cells < 4% and 12 patients residual cells

residual cells and relapse was 6 month and is identical
with the data published by Uzunel et al. [39]. Other stud-
ies could not find a correlation between mixed chimerism
and relapse [40-42]. To what extend mixed chimerism
gives evidence about relapse is discussed controversially.
In here presented data the occurrence of residual cells was
not a marker for relapse. One reason might be the retro-
spective analysis of patients in this work.
In 12 patients a simultaneous hybridization of gono-
somes and disease-markers was applied. 7 patients had
disease-marker positive residual cells. But the study
showed also that disease-marker positive and disease-
marker negative residual cells can be verified within a
sample. The detection of disease-marker positive residual
cells had no impact on relapse or survival. In contrast
Führer et al. [14] could detect disease-marker positive
residual cells before relapse. Thiele et al. [13] also
arranged a simultaneous hybridization of gonosomes and
disease-markers and assumed that cells carrying the dis-
ease-marker represent the source for later relapse.
In 3 samples only disease-marker negative residual cells
were found. They might represent 1) healthy (benign) leu-
cocytes, 2) precursor tumor cells which do not yet carry
the disease-marker, 3) false negative disease-marker posi-
tive cells, 4) endothelial cells or 5) cells from female
donors with sons.

Table 3: Parameters used for automated scanning
Parameter/Group Values Description
Capturing
Color Channels DAPI SpO/SpA (X) FITC/TRITC (Y)
Max. Integration Time 1.0 s 0.5 s 0.33 s For capturing images with comparable signal intensities,
automatic integration time adjustment was used to reach a
certain saturation level in the images while the maximum
integration time was limited to 0.5 s (green) and 0.33 s (red)
for keeping the background level at low intensities for empty
image fields (e.g. not showing signals).
Saturation Area 4 μm2 0.7 μm2 1 μm2
N Focus Planes 1 5 5 Due to the fact that nuclei are not perfectly flattend on the
glass slide by preparation but show Z dimensions within a
certain range, the fluorescently labeled chromosomes may be
randomly localized in the nucleus also in Z direction.
Distance 0 μm 0.75 μm 0.75 μm To image the FISH spots perfectly focused, for each signal
channel 5 focus planes are captured with a distance of 0.75 μm
(this correlates with the depth of field of the objective lens
used). These focal planes are then combined to an "Extended
Focus Image" which is used for analysis later.
CCD Gain 400% A CCD camera gain factor was specified to reduce the
integration times needed and thereby increase the scanning
speed. With the value specified the electronic noise in the
captured images was still negligible.
Use CS Mask during Capt Yes This parameter was activated to use the counterstain mask for
integration time adjustment. As bright artifacts within the
image field would usually interfere with the automatic
integration time adjustment, using the counterstain mask
enabled correct adjustment for image fields where such
artifacts were only present outside the nuclei.
Image Processing MedianV MedianV An image processing operation was applied to the signal
channels to reduce the noise level without significantly
reducing the sharpness of the image by vertical median filtering.
This filtering was used to remove small "hot spots" of one pixel
size in the images which appear in CCD camera images after
long integrations or due to camera pixel defects.
Cell Selection
Obj. Threshold 23% An object threshold of 23% in the counterstain channel was
used to segment the cell nuclei. The value is a percentage based
on the total contrast range of the captured image.
Min. Nucleus Area 18 μm2 The minimum/maximum area in μm2 for a single cell nucleus to
be accepted for analysis was used e.g. to exclude (larger) cell
clusters.
Max. Nucleus Area 200 μm2
Max. Rel. Conc. Depth 0.4 This criterion has been used to discriminate single cells
(showing a convex contour with only small concave areas)
from cell clusters (which usually have large concavities). The
limit is specified relative to the nucleus diameter.
Max. Aspect Ratio 2.8 This criterion has been used to discriminate the nuclei of
interest from more elongated objects. It specifies the maximum
ratio of the nucleus diameters along the long and the short
principal axis.
Cell Processing
CS/R/G SBHistoMax ApplyMask Additional image processing was applied to reduce background/
exclude image content outside nucleus contour.
Extend CS Mask 0.5 μm To correctly identify signals on the nucleus edge the
counterstain mask has been extended by 0.5 μm.

Conclusion
Automated chimerism analysis is a robust and sensitive
method which can be used in routine diagnosis to detect
residual cells effectively and economically. Simultaneous
hybridization of gonosomes and disease-marker represent
a sensitive method to detect disease-marker positive resid-
ual cells with a very low cut off level. The amount of resid-
ual cells correlates with survival. There are patients with
residual cells < 4% without tendency of relapse. The detec-
tion of disease-marker positive residual cells up to 1.3%
does not correlate with relapse. Disease-marker positive
and disease-marker negative residual cells can appear at
the same time in one sample. The definite origin of dis-
ease-marker negative residual cells is unclear and should
be investigated in a large multicenter study.
Methods
Controls
Peripheral blood samples of 21 clinically healthy male
(11) and female (10) between 6 and 67 years were studied
as controls.
Patients
A total of 28 female and 30 male patients were analyzed
retrospectively after sex-mismatched stem cell transplan-
tation which were performed between 1995 and 2006 at
the University Medical Centre Jena. As shown in Table 1,
there were 24 acute myloid leukemia (AML), 16 chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML), 5 acute lymphatic leukemia
(ALL), 4 multiple myeloma (MM), 3 severe aplastic ane-
mia (SAA), 2 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and 1
patient each with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL),
chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL), lymphoma (Lym) and
osteopetrosis (OP). Conditioning regimens were dose
reduced in 30 patients or myeloablative in 23 patients
[44-46] 54 patients underwent peripheral blood stem-cell
transplantation (PBCST) and the remaining 4 bone mar-
row transplantation (BMT). The median age of the trans-
planted patients was 46 years (2–89 years). 12 patients
showed cytogenetic disease-marker in their malignant
cells, i.e. a bcr/abl-fusion in nine and a trisomy 8 in three
patients. Overall, 19 patients died, either due to relapse (n
= 9), a graft-versus-host-disease (n = 3) or an infection (n
= 4). In 3 patients the reason of death remained unclear.
Cytogenetics and molecular cytogenetics including FISH
analysis
Standard techniques were used to cultivate leukocytes out
of venous blood, prepare chromosome-preparations [43],
and to perform interphase FISH analysis [44]. Commer-
cially available probes (Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany) for
LSI-ES bcr/abl, centromere 8, X and Y were applied.
Automatic chimerism analysis
For automated analysis we used an Axioplan 2 Imaging
microscope (Carl Zeiss Jena, Germany) equiped with
CCD-camera CV-M1, 1280 × 1024 pixel (Jai Glostrup,
Denmark) and a motorized stage with 8 slide positions
(Märzhäuser, Wetzlar, Germany). All components were
connected to a personal computer (Dell, Langen, Ger-
many) running the Metafer/MetaCyte-Software from
MetaSystems (Altlussheim, Germany).
The evaluation procedure of FISH-slides was as followed:
8 slides were automatically scanned over night and the
amount of residual cells was registered. Cells which did
not have the characteristic signal combination for XX and
XY were excluded. All detected potential residual cells
were visually controlled by microscope and each valid cell
was further examined wether the residual cell carried a dis-
ease-marker or not. The system allowed repositioning of
all residual cells in order to visually control the group of
interest.
Features/Spot Counting
Max. Spot Rel. Area 100/1000 15/1000 To differentiate true FISH spots from variations in the
fluorescence background, an upper limit for the relative area of
a spot, compared to the whole nucleus (in units of 1/1000) was
defined, This was mainly of interest for the green channel (Y
chromosome).
R (X) SpotCounts (5,27) The number of red FISH spots was determined. Spots were
accepted (counted) if they had a minimum distance of 0.5 μm
and a minimum intensity of 27% compared to the brightest
spot in the same cell.
Reject if > 2 Cells with more than 2 red spots were automatically rejected.
G (Y) SpotCounts (14,78) The number of green FISH spots was determined. Spots were
accepted (counted) if they had a minimum distance of 1.4 μm
and a minimum intensity of 78% compared to the brightest
spot in the same cell.
Reject if > 2 Cells with more than 2 green spots are automatically rejected.
Reject if No Spots Yes Cells not showing any X signals are automatically rejected.
Most important parameters for the classifier used for analyzing the patient samples.
