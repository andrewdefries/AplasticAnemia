Abstract
Hereditary elliptocytosis is a congenital hemolytic anemia characterized by the presence of oval
shaped erythrocytes in the peripheral blood. In rare cases, transient pure red blood cell aplasia can be
the initial clinical presentation.
We report a case of a 27-month-old boy admitted with fever without focus, severe poikilocytic
anemia, no evidence of hemolysis, a normocelular bone marrow and negative serological tests for
viral infections. One month before admission, he had been treated with phenytoin and valproate after
a seizure episode without fever.
Analysis of red cell membrane proteins showed a 16% decrease in spectrin levels, also detected in his
father and brother, confirming the diagnosis of elliptocytosis.
Only his father carried the aLELY
mutation, in trans to the a-spectrin mutation.
Introduction
Hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) is a congenital hemolytic
disorder characterized by an elongated (cigar or oval)
shape of erythrocytes [1-3].
This disorder is the result of a defect in one of the
cytoskeletal proteins in the red blood cells membrane that
are usually responsible for the elasticity and durability of
circulating erythrocytes. A few mutations of the alpha-
spectrin subunit are responsible for most cases of HE. HE
also occurs with deficiencies in protein 4.1 or glycophorin
C or when defects of band 3 protein or beta-spectrin
subunit impair ankyrin binding [1]. Although sponta-
neous mutations have been reported, HE is transmitted
predominantly as an autosomal dominant trait with at
least 4 genetic loci implicated [1,2,4]. It is characterized by
clinical, biochemical, and genetic heterogeneity.
The true incidence is unknown because most of the
patients are asymptomatic but generally it is estimated to
be present in 1 per 2000-5000 individuals [1-3]. HE has no
sex predilection [1,2].

The clinical presentation of patients with HE is highly
variable. Most patients are asymptomatic, and the
diagnosis is made incidentally when a blood smear is
examined. Less often, patients experience intermittent
episodes of more intense hemolysis with anemia, jaun-
dice, and splenomegaly [1].
Typical presenting signs in patients with severe HE include
neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and anemia in the first few
months of life. In addition, they present frequently
complications of severe hemolysis, including anemia,
splenomegaly, growth retardation, frontal bossing, and
early gallbladder disease [1].
Members of the same family may exhibit different clinical
courses, and an individual’s frequency and severity of
hemolysis may change with time [1,5].
Transient pure red blood cell aplasia has been reported in
patients with chronic hemolysis such as HE. Under these
conditions, the erythrocytes’s life span is much shorter
than in normal individuals so that a brief cessation of
erythropoiesis may cause severe anemia, known as
“aplasic crisis” [5,6]. Patients can develop uncompen-
sated anemia with marked weakness and dyspnea, pallor,
tachycardia and incipient heart failure. The etiology of
pure red cell aplasia is diverse, with parvovirus being the
most common cause [1,5]. Other causes identified: 1)
viral infections like mumps, infectious mononucleosis,
atypical mycoplasmal pneumonia and viral hepatitis; 2)
drugs: antiepileptic medications (eg. phenytoin, carba-
mazepine, sodium valproate), azathioprine, chloram-
phenicol, sulfonamides, isoniazid, procainamide [5]. In
some cases a bone marrow aspiration may be performed,
which typically shows erythroid hypoplasia or aplasia
and characteristic large proerythroblasts confirming
the diagnosis. However if it is done during the recovery
phase it may show active erythropoiesis that can be
misleading.
The hallmark of HE is the presence of cigar-shaped
elliptocytes on the peripheral blood smear [1,2,7].
Elliptocytes are normochromic and normocytic and
range from few to 100% of the erythrocytes [1].
Spherocytes, ovalocytes, stomatocytes, microcytes and
fragmented cells may also be observed [1,7]. The elliptical
erythrocyte form is acquired in the circulation and that is
why the reticulocytes and bone marrow red blood
precursors are normal in shape [2].
A complete blood count (CBC) reveals the degree of
anemia. The reticulocyte count reflects the severity of
hemolysis - in mild HE is typically less than 5%, but in the
severe forms of HE reticulocyte counts can be as high as
30% [1].
A review of the family history and the analysis of the red
blood cell morphology can usually confirm the diagnosis
[1,7]. Sometimes additional tests may be required includ-
ing the analysis of cDNA and genomic DNA and the study
of membrane proteins by gel electrophoresis and spectrin-
dimer self-association assays [1].
Treatment is rarely indicated for patients with mild HE. In
severe cases, occasional erythrocyte transfusions may be
required. Daily folate is recommended for patients with
significant chronic hemolysis [1,7]. Phototherapy and
exchange transfusion are warranted in cases of severe
anemia and hyperbilirubinemia. Splenectomy has been
palliative in severe cases of HE, but should be avoided in
patients younger than 5 years old due to the risk of
pneumococcal disease.
Here we report a case of transient pure red blood cell
aplasia as clinical presentation of HE in a patient with no
history or laboratory evidence of hemolysis, who had been
treated with phenytoin and valproate after a seizure
episode without fever one month before admission.
Case presentation
A 27-month-old Caucasian boy was admitted to the
pediatric unit with fever (39.5°C) for the last 3 days, poor
peripheral perfusion, myalgias and anorexia. Twelve days
before he had had a cold-like syndrome. Physical examina-
tion revealed intense pallor, a runny nose and bilateral
cervical lymph node enlargement. He had no jaundice.
He had been admitted one month before with seizures
without fever and a diagnosis of benign transient
hyperphosphatasemia of childhood was then established.
He was treated with phenytoin replaced shortly thereafter
by sodium valproate, which he took for 3 days. During this
admission he had no anemia nor any clinical or laboratory
evidence of hemolysis.
He is the second son of a non-consanguineous couple with
unremarkable family history; there were no records of
anemia, jaundice, gallstones or splenomegaly. He required
phototherapy for neonatal jaundice.
Laboratory studies (Table 1) showed severe microcytic and
hypochromic anemia with reticulocytopenia, a normal
white blood cell count and thrombocytosis. Peripheral
blood smear (PBS) showed anisocytosis and some cigar-
shaped cells. Serum CRP levels were high (29.1 mg/dl,
normal < 0.5 mg/dl). Additional laboratory studies,
including serum bilirubin, LDH, and a Coombs test,
were normal with no evidence of hemolysis.
A bone marrow aspirate revealed a normocelular marrow
with mild dyseritropoiesis, but with normal hematopoiesis,

having no blasts or other abnormal cells, and increased iron
in the reticuloendothelial system with no ringed
sideroblasts.
Serological tests for mycoplasma, hepatitis, rubella,
cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, Epstein-Barr virus, par-
vovirus (B19) and adenovirus infection were negative.
Blood and urine cultures were also negative.
Chest radiography and abdominal sonography were
normal.
After 3 days of intravenous ceftriaxone he became apyretic.
A rise of Hb and reticulocyte levels was observed by the
fifth day of admission and there was no need for red blood
cell transfusions. A follow up PBS showed microcytosis,
anisopoikilocytosis, polychromasia, teardrop cells, frag-
mented cells and elliptocytes. Three weeks later, the
serological tests for viral infections were again negative.
Hemoglobin electrophoresis, enzymes studies, high per-
formance liquid chromatography, electrophoresis of red
cell membrane proteins and aLELY
mutation studies were
carried out in the patient and his family. These studies
showed a 16%, 15% and 18% decrease in spectrin levels in
the patient, his brother and his father, respectively,
confirming the diagnosis of hereditary elliptocytosis.
Only the father is heterozygous for the aLELY
mutation
trans to a-spectrin mutation.
Discussion and conclusion
The patient presented with severe anemia, no clinical or
laboratory evidence of a hemolytic process, and no family
history of hemolysis. Reticulocyte count was low for the
degree of anemia and compatible with medullar com-
promise. PBS initially showed severe poikilocytosis that
could be explained by some degree of stress erythropoiesis.
A normocellular bone marrow aspirate with normal
hematopoiesis, no blast, no abnormal cells, or ringed
sideroblast excluded acute leukemia or other neoplastic
diseases involving the marrow, aplastic anemia, or side-
roblastic anemia, but could be interpreted as the recovery
phase of red cell aplasia.
Normal hemoglobin values one month before admission
suggested a somewhat rapid process, and did not
agree with a diagnosis of transient erythroblastopenia of
childhood [8].
The history of neonatal jaundice and the previous cold-like
syndrome, coupled with the PBS findings of severe
poikilocytosis were also compatible with transient pure
red blood cell aplasia in recovery in a patient with some
form of congenital hemolytic anemia.
Pyropoikilocytosis was included in the differential diag-
nosis and a search for aLELY
mutations was added to other
red cell membrane protein studies. Later smears showed
more typical elliptocytes. Most patients with elliptocytosis
are asymptomatic. Therefore, the unremarkable family
history of our patient is not unexpected. The electrophor-
esis of the membrane proteins showed that the patient, his
father and brother have a decrease in spectrin levels
compatible with hereditary elliptocytosis. Additionally,
his father carried the aLELY
mutation, in trans to the
a-spectrin mutation.
Several possibilities exist in this case that could explain the
aplastic crisis. An infectious cause agrees with a history of a
cold-like syndrome a few days before admission, an initial
presentation with fever and a positive serum CRP, but
blood cultures and extensive serological tests were negative.
Other possible causes include the drugs phenytoin and
sodium valproate, taken one month before. This etiology
has been reported, but the drugs were used only for a short
time.
No published report in the literature exists to our
knowledge that correlates pure red cell aplasia with benign
hyperphosphatasemia of childhood. One-half of aplastic
crises cases remain unexplained [9].
In these cases of red cell aplasia, a transfusion therapy may
be necessary if symptomatic anemia, the offending drugs
should be discontinued, and the associated infections or
other illness should be treated. Our patient presented an
intense pallor without signs of clinical decompensation
(like hemodynamic instability) in spite of low Hb level. In
addition, bone marrow aspirate evidence signs of marrow
recovery. Hence, we decided to make a close follow-up

with blood cell count instead of transfusion therapy. The
patient was also treated for a possible bacterial infection in
spite of negative blood culture. In admission, he was not
taking any drugs that could be responsible for aplasia.
The publication of this case has the objective to alert for
the possibility of chronicle hemolytic anemia to be
presented as an acute self-limited pure red cell aplasia,
which may be due to drugs.
