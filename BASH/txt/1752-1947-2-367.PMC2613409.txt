Abstract
Introduction: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is an immune-mediated syndrome that
typically has a rapidly progressive course that can result in pancytopenia, coagulopathy, multi-
system organ failure and death.
Case presentation: A 57-year-old Caucasian woman was referred in fulminant hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis, with fever, pancytopenia, splenomegaly, mental status changes and respiratory
failure. She was found to have stage IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma, in addition to Epstein-Barr virus
and cytomegalovirus viremia. Her presentation was preceded by a 3-year prodrome consisting of
cytopenia and fever that were partially controlled by steroids and azathioprine.
Conclusion: Fulminant hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis may follow a prodromal phase that
possesses features suggestive of a chronic form of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, but which
may also resemble immune cytopenias of other causes. A diagnosis of hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis should be considered in the setting of chronic pancytopenia.
Introduction
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syn-
drome characterized by fever, hepato-splenomegaly, lym-
phadenopathy, pancytopenia, rash, and
hemophagocytosis by non-malignant macrophages [1,2].
Laboratory findings characteristic of this disease include
hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia, hypofibrinogen-
emia and liver function test abnormalities. The symptoms
of HLH are typically rapidly progressive, often resulting in
death from hemorrhage, multi-system organ failure, or
infection. Survival from HLH requires prompt recognition
of the syndrome, correction of its underlying cause, and
HLH-specific therapies such as etoposide [3].
HLH occurs in both inherited and acquired forms. Inher-
ited forms have been attributed to defects in perforin
function and other intracellular pathways required for the
release of cytolytic granules by NK cells and cytotoxic T-
lymphocytes [2]. In its acquired forms, HLH has been
associated with infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), inflammatory dis-
eases, such as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and malig-

nancies, such as T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) [2,4]. In HLH, an apparent loss
of restraint of the function of normal histiocytic cells is
correlated with the elaboration of high levels of inter-
feron-γ by activated CD8+ T-cells and TNF-α and IL-6 by
activated macrophages [5].
Acquired forms of the disease typically follow a rapid
course. In a series of six cases associated with Epstein-Barr
infection, all of the patients died within 3 months of the
initial onset of symptoms [6]. In most cases associated
with HL, the first symptoms suggestive of HLH preceded
death or definitive therapy by only 1 to 2 months [7-11].
Case presentation
A 57-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to a hospi-
tal in Philadelphia, PA, USA in October, 2006 for persist-
ent fever and pancytopenia following debridement of a
buttock abscess.
Three years before her admission, she had rectal bleeding
and was found to have a platelet count of 65 × 109/liter
(laboratory reference values are given in Table 1). Upper
gastrointestinal (GI) workup revealed gastric ulcers with
an associated Helicobacter pylori infection. She received
appropriate therapy, but developed a rash and a decline in
her platelet count to 30 × 109/liter and her hemoglobin
(Hb) concentration to 80 g/liter. Bone marrow examina-
tion showed a hypercellular marrow with a myeloid left
shift. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed
splenomegaly without focal lesions but no lymphadenop-
athy. She was treated with prednisone (1 mg/kg) for a pre-
sumed autoimmune anemia with thrombocytopenia
(Evans syndrome). Her anemia corrected, but her platelet
count rose to only 59 × 109/liter. She continued to have
cytopenias with febrile episodes. She received additional
courses of steroids and was maintained on azathioprine
(3.5 mg/kg/day). At one point, she had a white blood cell
count (WBC) nadir < 0.5 × 109/liter and was given filgras-
tim. Three months before her admission, she felt well and
was employed full-time. Her blood counts were: WBC 1.8
× 109/liter with an absolute neutrophil count of 1.386 ×
109cells/liter, Hb 108 g/liter, mean cell volume (MCV)
85.8 fL, platelet count 112 × 109/liter.

Eleven days before her referral, she was admitted to an
outside hospital with temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F)
and a right buttock abscess. Her WBC was 0.5 × 109/liter,
Hb 75 g/liter, platelets 47 × 109/liter. The buttock lesion
was debrided. Bone marrow biopsy showed a hypercellu-
lar marrow with erythroid and megakaryocytic hyperpla-
sia and clusters of atypical megakaryocytes. Her
medications included decadron 20 mg q 12 hours, filgras-
tim, darbepoietin, albumin, imipenem, diflucan, acyclo-
vir, protonix, folate, and vitamin B12.
Admission studies
Examination was notable for temperature 37.7°C
(100.0°F), blood pressure 126/68, respiratory rate 28,
pulse 122, oxygen saturation 92% on room air. She had
pallor, mild jaundice, a 2/6 systolic flow murmur,
splenomegaly, a 3 × 3 cm right buttock eschar, ecchy-
moses on her arms and left flank, and 3+ bilateral lower
extremity edema. She had no lymphadenopathy,
hepatomegaly, or musculoskeletal findings. Her mental
status exam was significant for a flat affect and orientation
to self, but not to the current year, the hospital name, or
her date of birth.
Laboratory studies (Table 1) were remarkable for pancyto-
penia and a coagulopathy. She had elevations in her ferri-
tin, triglycerides, bilirubin, and liver function tests. Her
haptoglobin was low, but her direct anti-globulin test was
negative. Her peripheral blood smear demonstrated no
spherocytic or microangiopathic changes. An antinuclear
antibody (ANA) screen was also negative.
Chest CT demonstrated bibasilar patchy pulmonary con-
solidation, small pleural effusions, and small calcified
mediastinal lymph nodes. Abdominal CT scan showed an
enlarged spleen with 10 low-density, indeterminate
lesions, similar lesions in the liver, bilateral renal infarcts,
and a left psoas hemorrhage. Head CT and echocardiogra-
phy were unremarkable.
Hospital course
Decadron, antibiotics, and growth factors were continued.
A diagnosis of hemophagocytic syndrome was consid-
ered, and intravenous cyclosporine was started. Despite
aggressive transfusion support, minimal changes were
noted in her pancytopenia and coagulopathy. Blood cul-
tures were negative for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacte-
rial pathogens. EBV serologies were notable for IgG EBV
capsid protein and IgG EBNA antibodies, but negative for
IgM EBV capsid antibodies. EBV DNA copy number in the
blood was 27,800/ml, and the CMV DNA copy number
was 16,500/ml. Tests for human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6),
Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B surface antigen, and human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative.
On the third hospital day, she had increased retroperito-
neal bleeding, as indicated by expansion of her flank
ecchymosis and an increased red blood cell (RBC) trans-
fusion requirement. She developed respiratory fatigue and
required mechanical ventilation. Bronchoscopic examina-
tion was unremarkable, but lavage cultures were positive
for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and CMV. Ganciclovir
was initiated. She was extubated the following day, but
required bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and con-
tinued to have fever and a clouded sensorium.
A bone marrow aspirate revealed a hypercellular bone
marrow containing maturing trilineage hematopoiesis
with prominent megakaryopoiesis and hyperplastic dys-
erythropoiesis (Figure 1A). The erythroid series showed
pronounced megaloblastoid change and abundant atypi-
cal erythroid precursors, including multinucleated nor-
moblasts and many normoblasts with bizarre nuclear
configurations (Figure 1A). Occasional large foamy mac-
rophages containing other hematopoietic elements were
noted. Rare very large atypical multinucleated cells with
basophilic cytoplasm and separate oval nuclei with prom-
inent nucleoli were also identified (Figure 1B).
The bone marrow core biopsy revealed a hypercellular
marrow with background maturing trilineage hematopoi-
esis and a conspicuous increase in large histiocytes/mac-
rophages, many of which contained hemosiderin and/or
other hematopoietic elements, consistent with hemo-
phagocytosis. In addition, tumor nodules were present,
composed of large, irregular mononuclear cells with scat-
tered, bizarre tumor giant cells containing hyperchro-
matic nuclei with coarse chromatin and prominent
macronucleoli (Figures 1C and 1D). Occasional binucle-
ated Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells were noted (Figure 1E).
These tumor nodules occupied approximately 10% to
20% of the total marrow cross-sectional area within the
core biopsy and were accompanied by a reticulin fibrosis.
The tumor giant cells were strongly positive for CD30
(Figure 1F) and Ki67, but negative for other B-cell and T-
cell markers, myeloid markers, CMV antigens and EBV
latent membrane protein (LMP). Significant histiocytosis
was also noted with phagocytosis of erythroid and mye-
loid cells (Figure 1G). CD68 staining revealed innumera-
ble histiocytes/macrophages throughout the bone
marrow interstitium, many of which contained numerous
intact hematopoietic cells (Figure 1H). On the basis of
these studies, she received a diagnosis of Stage IV HL with
concurrent HLH.
She received a single cycle of dose-reduced adriamycin,
bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD) chemo-
therapy for treatment of her HL. Two days later, she had a
seizure of 2 to 3 minutes duration that involved her upper
extremities and facial muscles. Her bilirubin rose to 316

μmol/liter (18.5 mg/dl), ferritin to 34,820 μg/liter,
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to 265 U/liter, and aspar-
tate aminotransferase (AST) to 388 U/liter. Following a
discussion with her health care proxy, comfort measures
were instituted and she died the following day.
Post-mortem pathologic studies
Gross examination revealed severe jaundice, petechial
hemorrhages of the skin and gastric mucosa, mediastinal
lymphadenopathy, and a hematoma over the left psoas
muscle. Diffuse alveolar damage was noted in the lungs.
Classical HL was observed in the spleen, liver, bone mar-
row, left kidney, and paratracheal lymph nodes (Figures
2A and 2B). The tumor infiltrates contained RS cells (Fig-
ure 2C), which were positive for CD30 (Figure 2D) but
negative for other B-cell and T-cell markers and EBV LMP.
Taken together, the bone marrow and autopsy findings
confirmed a diagnosis of stage IV HL and HLH.
Discussion
In acquired cases of HLH, the clinical course is rapidly
progressive with multi-system organ failure often occur-
ring within weeks of the initial diagnosis of the syndrome.
In our patient, fulminant HLH was present for approxi-
mately 3 weeks before her death. The standard definition
of HLH requires that at least 5 of 8 clinical criteria be met:
fever, splenomegaly, peripheral cytopenias of 2 or 3 line-
ages, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated ferritin (>500 μg/
liter), elevated soluble CD25 (sCD25), absent NK-cell
activity, and histological evidence of HLH in bone mar-
row, lymph nodes, or spleen. Our patient had six of these:
fever, splenomegaly, peripheral cytopenias of three line-
ages, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated ferritin, and histolog-
ical evidence of HLH. Typical of HLH, she also had a
coagulopathy, liver function test abnormalities, an ele-
vated LDH, and CNS dysfunction.
It is possible that our patient had a chronic form of HLH.
For 3 years before her admission, three of the diagnostic
criteria for HLH were present: fever, cytopenias, splenom-
egaly. Additional laboratory studies to support the diag-
nosis were not obtained (triglycerides, ferritin, sCD25,
and NK-cell activity). A bone marrow biopsy did not show
hemophagocytic cells, but initial bone marrow biopsies
are insensitive tests for the diagnosis of HLH [2]. In addi-
tion, there are few competing explanations for her cytope-
nias. In the absence of a clinically apparent malignancy
and excluding HLH, the differential diagnosis for pancy-
topenia includes premalignant, inflammatory, infectious,
genetic, and toxic causes (Table 2). Most of these could be
ruled out on the basis of the history and laboratory stud-
ies. Furthermore, bone marrow did not show any prema-
lignant, infiltrative or infectious processes, no toxins were
involved, and an infection with parvovirus would have
been self-limited.
If our patient did have chronic HLH, what was the most
likely cause? At the time of her death, she had three con-
ditions associated with HLH: active EBV infection, active
CMV infection, and HL. Her chronic HLH may have been
the result of any of these, but we consider HL to be the
most likely cause, since occult HL can exist for many years
[12]. In contrast, acute EBV and CMV infections are asso-
ciated with fever, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and
fatigue and would likely have been self-limited. EBV anti-
gens are commonly expressed by RS cells in patients with
HL and HLH [13]. In our patient, the RS cells were nega-
tive for EBV LMP, indicating that her HL and EBV reactiva-
tion were independent disease processes. Treatment with
azathioprine and steroids may have facilitated reactiva-
tion of EBV and CMV late in her disease course while par-
tially treating her HLH and HL.
Conclusion
We have described a case of acquired HLH that presented
in a fulminant form following a 3-year prodrome that was
consistent with a mild, chronic form of HLH. Chronic
