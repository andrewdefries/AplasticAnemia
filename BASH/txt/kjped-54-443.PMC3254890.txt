Changes in the neonatal and infant mortality rate and
the causes of death in Korea
Neonatal mortality rate (NMR) or infant mortality rate (IMR) are the
rate of deaths per 1,000 live births at which babies of either less than
four weeks or of one year of age die, respectively. The NMR and IMR
are commonly accepted as a measure of the general health and well-
being of a population. Korea’s NMR and IMR fell significantly between
1993 and 2009 from 6.6 and 9.9 to 1.7 and 3.2, respectively. Common
causes of infantile death in 2008 had decreased compared with those
in 1996 such as other disorders originating in the perinatal period,
congenital malformation of the heart, bacterial sepsis of newborns,
disorders related to length of gestation and fetal growth, intra-uterine
hypoxia, birth asphyxia. However, some other causes are on the
increase, such as respiratory distress of newborn, other respiratory
conditions originating in the perinatal period, other congenital malfor­
mation, diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain
disorders involving the immune mechanism. In this study, we provide
basic data about changes of NMR and IMR and the causes of neonatal
and infantile death from 1983 to 2009 in Korea.

In Korea, during the past 60 years there has been marked
improvement in the management of maternity, pregnancy, delivery,
birth,neonatalandinfantilehealthcarebyaqualitativeimprovement
in obstetric, perinatal, neonatal, and pediatric medical conditions.
As a result, despite increasing trends of high-risk newborns including
prematurity, neonatal survival rates are improving with the
development of neonatal intensive care medicine. In addition, the

changes and trends of NMR and IMR over the past 60 years in
Korea, which makes it important to review the differences in the
causes of neonatal and infantile death and understand the current
state. Therefore, in this review, we attempted to analyze the changes

causes of death accompanying improved NMR and IMR. We also
attempted to provide basic data for neonatal and infantile health

Data collection
1. NMR and IMR in Korea
From 1993 the official IMR of investigation by Korea Ministry of
Health and Welfare (KMHW)3)
has been published on a national
scale. KMHW has enlisted the services of the Korea Institute for
Health and Social Affairs (KIHASA) since 1993 and have been
publishing data on Korean NMR and IMR4-7)
. These data are
reported to the United Nations, WHO, Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) and are used as reference
guides on Korean statistics. A large amount of personal data has
accumulated prior to 19938)
. Therefore, we used data by KHMW
from1993anduseddatabyStatisticsKoreafrom2007.Wealsoused
data by Chang et al.8)

Changes in the NMR and IMR in Korea
1. Changes of NMR in Korea (1993 to 2009)
Overall, Korean NMR shows a decline: 6.6 in 1993, 4.1 in 1996,
3.8 in 1999, 3.3 in 2002, 2.8 in 2005, 2.5 in 2006, 2.0 in 2007, 1.8
in 2008 and 1.7 in 2009 (Fig. 1). The change of early and late NMR
is shown in Table 1, and also shows a decline. The proportion of early
NMR is 79% in 1993, 69% in 1999, 70% in 2002, 69% in 2005,
68% in 2009, exhibiting a reducing trend. However, early NMR
contributes to more than two-thirds the proportion of large numbers
inNMR(Table1).

2) IMR after 1933
The IMR in Korea since 1993 are summarized in Fig. 1. A
remarkable reduction in IMR was observed: 9.9 in 1993, 7.7 in 1996,
6.2in1999,5.3in2002,4.7in2005,4.1in2006,3.5in2007,3.4in
2008and3.2in20098)
.
3) Proportion of NMR of IMR
The ratio of NMR in IMR is shown in Fig. 2. The ratio has been
decreasing slowly: 66.7% in 1993, 53.2% in 1996, 61.3% in 1999,
62.3% in 2002, 59.6% in 2005, 61.0% in 2006, 57.1% in 2007,
52.9% in 2008, and 53.1% in 2009. According to this data, the
NMR still consists of approximately half the IMR, implicating the
reduction in NMR could be one of the most important factors of
improvingIMRinKorea8)

The numbers of neonatal deaths decreased from 1025 in 2005
to 771 in 2009. The causes and number of neonatal deaths in
Korea in 2005 and 2009 by KCD are shown in Table 3. Certain
conditions originating in the perinatal period (P00-P96) in 2005
(67.7%) and 2009 (72.1%) were the highest, followed by congenital
malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormality
(Q00-Q99) in 2005 (16.2%) and 2009 (15.3%), and symptoms,
signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere
classified (NEC) (R00-R99) in 2005 (12.5%) and 2009 (6.6%).
Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period and congenital
malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities are
important causes, which means diseases in perinatal period and soon

The causes and numbers of infant death classified by block
categories of KCD are shown in Table 7. In order of frequency,
they are symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory
findings, NEC (R00-R99) 33.1%, diseases of the respiratory system
(J00-J98) 20.6%, congenital malformations, deformations and
chromosomal abnormalities (Q00-Q99) 11.9%, certain infectious

3) Changes in the ten major causes of infant death (1996-
2008)10)
The changes in the ten major causes of infant death in 1996, 1999,
2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 in Korea by Choi's study10)
of
KIHASA are shown inTable 8. Common causes of infantile death in
2008 had decreased compared with those in 1996 such as other dis­
orders originating in the perinatal period, congenital malformation
of the heart, bacterial sepsis of newborns, disorders related to length
of gestation and fetal growth, intra-uterine hypoxia, birth asphyxia.
However, some other causes are on the increase, such as respiratory
distress of newborn, symptoms, other respiratory conditions origina­
ting in the perinatal period, other congenital malformation, diseases of
the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving
theimmunemechanism.
Discussion
The NMR of Korea decreased from 6.6 in 1993 to 4.1 in 1996, 3.8
in 1999, 3.3 in 2002, 2.8 in 2005, 2.5 in 2006, 2.0 in 2007, 1.8 in
2008and1.7in2009,showingaremarkablydecreasingtrend.Despite
the recent high risk of neonatal morbidity due to increasing premature
birth rates, the remarkable advances in NMR were partly influenced
by highly advanced neonatal intensive care technique during the last
30 years11)
. In addition, the reduced perinatal mortality rate during the
last 20 years (6.0 in 1996, 5.2 in 1999, 4.6 in 2002, 4.2 in 2005, 3.6
in 2006, 3.7 in 2007, 3.6 in 2008, and 3.4 in 2009) influenced the
lowered NMR as well12)
. With decreasing NMR, the proportion of
early NMR was 79% in 1993 and 68% in 2009, but the proportion

was still over two-thirds the entire NMR, emphasizing the importance
ofearlyperiodneonatalmanagement.
In addition, IMR has shown a decreasing pattern (9.9 in 1993, 7.7
in 1996, 6.2 in 1999, 5.3 in 2002, 4.7 in 2005, 4.1 in 2006, 3.5 in
207, 3.4 in 2008 and 3.2 in 2009). In comparison with Korea, Japan
and USA, the IMR of Japan and USA were 4.6 and 9.0 in 1990,
3.1 and 8.0 in 2000, 2.8 and 6.4 in 2005, and 2.8 and 6.3 in 2009,
respectively,whichmeanstheIMRofKoreaishigherthanthatofJapan
but lower than that of USA. Japan has the lowest IMR in the world,
which allows us to speculate on the reason why it is lower than Korea.
Reasons include operating perinatal health care centers and localization
of neonatal care networks which are not yet established in Korea. On
the other hand, the IMR of USA is higher than that of Korea, most
likely because of different ethnicities in USA, difficulty accessing
medical services, increased high risk pregnancy such as teenage or old
agepregnancy,multiplegestation,andincreasedpretermbirth8)
.
When we compare Korean IMR with other OECD nations, the
IMR of Korea and the mean of OECD are as follows: 7.7 and 8.1 in
1996, 6.2 and 7.1 in 1999, 5.3 and 6.5 in 2002, 4.1 and 4.9 in 2006
and3.4and4.7in2008showingtheencouragingfactthatKoreahasa

13thpositionin2008amongalltheOECDcountries8)
.
The ratio of NMR in IMR was 66.7% in 1993 and dropped to
53.1% in 2009, but NMR still consists of approximately half of IMR,
which shows that neonatal mortality has an important place in IMR
inKorea,andneonatalperiodmanagementismuchmoreimportant.
In changes in the ten major causes of neonatal death from 1996 to
2008 in Korea, respiratory distress of newborns, diseases of the blood
and blood-forming organs as well as certain disorfers involving the
immune mechanism, symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and
laboratory findings, NEC, other congenital malformation, and others
increased in ratio. In contrast, other respiratory conditions originating
in the perinatal period, bacterial sepsis of newborns, disorders related
to length of gestation and fetal growth, other respiratory conditions
originating in the perinatal period, congenital malfotmation of heart,
intrauterinehypoxia,birthasphyxiaweredecreasedintrend.
Common causes of infantile death in 2008 had decreased com­
pared with those in 1996 such as other disorders originating in the

Conclusions
The authors reviewed improvements in IMR over the last 60
years and NMR during last 20 years in Korea, finding remarkably
encouraging advances. Although Korean IMR is higher than that
of Japan, it is much lower than that of the USA and other OECD
nations. Changes in the neonatal and infantile causes of death related
to improved NMR and IMR were also analyzed. Our analysis may
furtherimprovetheNMRandIMRinthefutureinKorea.
