The Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry (ATSDR) has specific inter-
est in surveillance methods as part ofits stud-
ies of health effects potentially associated
with environmental contamination sites
(1,2). An earlier ATSDR-sponsored confer-
ence, held 30 October-1 November 1989 in
Asheville, North Carolina, laid much of the
groundwork for considering a specific listing
ofhealth events as candidates for this sentinel
application (3). This report is the product of
a sequel conference charged to review the
available scientific literature, assimilate rele-
vant experiences, and produce a framework
for a listing of sentinel health events (SHEs)
for use in monitoring health around sites of
environmental contamination. This consen-
sus panel was convened 18-19 May 1992 at
the University of North Carolina, Chapel
Hill, to identify SHEs that could serve as
indicators ofenvironmental contamination.
Early in the conference there were several
presentations building upon Rutstein's origi-
nal supposition regarding SHEs (4). Recent
other works relating to the use of sentinel
events in public health surveillance were also
discussed (5-9). Two days of deliberations
followed. Presented here are the consensus
statements and recommendations that
resulted from this endeavor.
Listing ofSHEs for Environmental
Contamination, by Type
Type L The following acute conditions are
regarded as SHEs in the form of the defini-
tion by Rutstein (1): 1) poisonings, especial-
ly due to pesticides, metals, or other agents
that might be found in waste streams, in dis-
posal sites, or other accessible locations.
Children are especially vulnerable to this
hazard. Lead and carbon monoxide poison-
ing are SHEs. Cholinesterase inhibition
would also be classified under poisoning; 2)
selected cancers that are specific for known
physical or chemical agents. In general, can-
cers are poor SHEs because of their long
latencies. Some cancers whose biology is suf-
ficiently well studied may be considered
SHEs, e.g., mesothelioma, clear cell cancer
of the vagina, and angiosarcoma of the liver;
3) precocious puberty or thelarche. Many
pesticides, industrial chemicals, and food
additives have estrogenic activity. Precocious
puberty is so rare that an inquiry into possi-
ble sources of estrogen exposure is warrant-
ed; 4) methemoglobinemia is a classic poi-
soning. It was included from the previous
panel's work (4); 5) toxic neuropathy.
Elicitation of an unusual exposure to a toxic
agent is required to make a diagnosis oftoxic
neuropathy; i.e., with Minimata disease, the
case definition includes exposure to
methylmercury.
Type II. Unusual health patterns (e.g.,
statistically significant excess cases or
space-time patterns) in incidence of the fol-
lowing conditions, identified via general sur-
veillance, may represent SHEs in a popula-
tion perspective. That is to say, the popula-
tion's experience forms a sentinel pattern,
and the pattern represents the event. 1)
Bladder cancer. Bladder cancer is one of the
human cancers with a strong association
with chemical exposures. The occurrence of
bladder cancer in a person without other risk
factors, such as smoking or occupational
exposures, or at a young age, should at least
be considered for investigation. Bladder can-
cer in a human and a companion animal
should also be similarly considered. Bladder
cancer occurring in genetically unrelated
individuals of any age living at the same
place may warrant investigation.
2) Lung cancer in nonsmokers. Multiple
suspicious events (three or more cases in a
"space-time cluster") should be investigated.
3) Primary liver cancer in nondrinkers. The
liver is an extremely plausible site for envi-
ronmentally related cancer; thus, occurrence
of liver cancer in a person without cirrhosis
or a history ofexposure to hepatitis B should
be investigated.
4) Rare cancers with some evidence to
suggest possible hazardous environmental
exposure. A few rare cancers that may be
considered as type II SHEs are rhab-
domyosarcoma, myelogenous leukemia,
acute leukemia in children, and acute granu-
locytic leukemia in adults. Multiple occur-
rences of these events raise suspicions about
potential environmental hazards. The occur-
rence of cancer and potentially biologically
related conditions, such as aplastic anemia,
may be sentinels.
5) Asthma in children. There may be
low-risk groups of children, such as those
who have no allergies, live in nonsmoking
households, etc., in whom the new occur-
rence ofwheezing could be a SHE; however,
the specificity ofthe event, even if identified,
would be low. 6) New diseases. The panel
encourages attention to the possible environ-
mental etiology of new diseases. Examples
are eosinophilia myalgia syndrome, toxic oil
syndrome, Yusho/Yucheng, Kawasaki dis-
ease, and Minimata disease.
Some laboratory measures were discussed
as possible sentinel findings or biologic
markers of hazardous environmental expo-
sures: 7) PCBs and PBBs, persistent pesti-
cides, other trace industrial chemicals.
There are a variety of xenobiotics (PCBs,
dioxins, dibenzofurans, DDT, termitocides)
that can be measured in human or animal
tissues. Abnormal levels ofthese compounds
are not established, and levels are dependent
on the analytical method used. At this time
it is unlikely that these findings can serve as
sentinels. As methods are developed for
large-scale applications and distributions in
populations become known, these measure-
ments may begin to serve as SHEs.
8) Adducts. Adducts of DNA or hemo-
globin are done on a research basis in a
number of laboratories. Public health
authorities are unlikely to be the recipients
of such information on a regular basis. For
the immediate future, such information will
be gathered only in the context of a specific
research study.
Data Sources for Monitoring SHEs
The panel identified a number of data
sources already in operation that could be
used for monitoring health conditions
potentially related to environmental expo-
sures. The extent that type I SHEs would be
represented among such health condition is
simply a matter ofdefining the type I SHEs
to be considered. These sources of data for
general surveillance, as well as SHE moni-
toring (of either type), include death certifi-
cates, cancer registries, hospital/outpatient
records, laboratory data (10), birth defects
registries (11), poisoning centers, and ani-
mal necropsy data bases (12). These sources
were considered to have the best potential
use in identifying sentinel health events
associated with environmental exposure.
The strengths, limitations, and applications
of these sources were discussed by the panel
in a context with the manner by which
health events could come to the attention of
an alert health care provider (13,14). The
United States has sometimes been criticized
for having a medical care delivery system
that impedes public health surveillance and
detection of SHEs. This is because no
unique universal identifiers exist, thus
records about health events are fragmented
across the health care delivery system, and
record linkage studies are difficult to under-
take. The alert provider is usually the person
who detects type I SHEs. In infectious dis-
ease outbreaks (e.g., pneumocystis pneumo-
nia), the role of the alert clinician is well

demonstrated. The alert practitioner also
often is the primary identifier of type II
problems; for example, in Puerto Rico
enlarged breasts in offspring offactory work-
ers exposed to hormones (12). Such reports
as these come from practitioners and from
the general public. Public health agencies
must begin to be more responsive with
investigating type I SHEs and should delib-
erately search for type II SHEs by systemati-
cally examining the available databases.
Dissemination ofSHE Technology
Modifying data systems to look for SHEs will
require resources, as well as a reorientation in
thinking by many public health workers (15).
In public health the emphasis is on common,
preventable diseases, and most epidemiolo-
gists and public health workers are not taught
to look for rare, improbable events. Public
health funding is not currently available for
examining rare events or the associated occur-
rence patterns. Technology is making pro-
cessing and examining large quantities ofdata
faster and more routine. However, even with
easy to use, sophisticated, and efficient com-
puter systems, systematic examination for

rare and unusual events will still take material
resources.
It is expected that the primary health
care provider, whether nurse, physician,
dentist, veterinarian, or other, will be the
primary identifier of SHEs. SHEs should be
brought to the attention of county health
departments, state health departments, or
the federal government through the state
health departments. Clinical practitioners
could be apprised ofthese candidate sentinel
events and explanations of what represents
an unusual health event pattern in the same
ways that the original occupational modes of
SHEs were publicized (e.g., publication in
medical journals, continuing medical educa-
tion courses).
Particular committees of the American
Academy of Pediatrics and of the American
Medical Association concern themselves
with the environment and could provide
leadership for the use of SHE reasoning.
National Institute of Health-funded centers
for environmental health train medical resi-
dents and offer courses through which infor-
mation regarding SHE surveillance may be
distributed.
Discussion
The alert health care provider will frequently
be the first and most critical element in
detecting SHEs, especially type I. This is
particularly true because obtaining morbidi-
ty data with high coverage in the United
States through existing data sources is limit-
ed. These providers need to be educated
about their role in detecting SHEs.
It is difficult to find examples of SHEs
detected through analysis of a database.
However, most investigations rely on a part-
nership between the practitioner and a pub-
lic health agency. The practitioner may
identify the first indication of a problem,
but the agency is needed to evaluate, con-
firm, and determine the scope of the prob-
lem. For example, with the problem ofvita-
min D in Massachusetts, three cases were
found, but the public health agency identi-
fied more cases and did investigative work
(14). Public health agencies should play a
greater role in the study of type I SHEs and
should search for type II SHEs by examin-
ing available databases. When local public
health agencies receive reports about type I
SHE occurrences, they should be evaluated
by familiar methods of confirming diagno-
sis, comparing rates, etc. (16).
Type II SHEs may be detected through
existing surveillance systems. New technolo-
gies have made traditionally time-consum-
ing and laborious activities easier (e.g., map-
ping disease cases). ATSDR has recently
produced a software package expressly to
facilitate these types of statistical analyses
(17). There are many innovative and excit-
ing uses of geographic information systems
for health applications that may facilitate
identification of type II SHEs. More inno-
vations are likely to become available in the
future. Research attention is needed for ways
of setting priorities and handling reports of
type II SHEs.
