Abstract
Platelets play a central role in the pathophysiology of atherothrombosis, an inappropriate platelet activation leading to
acute ischemic complications (acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke). In view of this, platelets are a major target
for pharmacotherapy. Presently, the main classes of antiplatelet agents approved for the use in such complications are
aspirin and thienopyridines. Although antiplatelet treatment with these two types of drugs, alone or in combination, leads
to a signiﬁcant reduction of non-fatal myocardial infarction (–32%), non-fatal stroke (–25%), and of cardiovascular death
(–17%), a residual risk persists.
Newer antiplatelet agents have addressed some, but not all, these limitations. Vis-à-vis their net clinical beneﬁt, the
higher potency of some of them is associated with a rise in bleeding complications. Moreover, newer thienopyridines do
not show advantages over and above the older ones as to reduction of stroke. A concerted effort that takes into considera-
tion clinical, genetic, and laboratory information is increasingly recognized as a major direction to be pursued in the area.
The well-established road signs of clinical epidemiology will provide major information to deﬁne newer potentially useful
targets for platelet pharmacology.

Introduction
Thrombotic (ischemic) complications of atheroscle-
rosis (acute coronary syndrome (ACS), acute myo-
cardial infarction (AMI), ischemic stroke) are the
leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Western
countries. Following atherosclerotic plaque disrup-
tion/endothelial cell detachment, circulating platelets,
exposed to a highly thrombogenic environment,
become activated (1). As shown inTable I, a series of
soluble agonists (ADP, thromboxane A2 (TxA2),
serotonin (5-HT), and thrombin) recruit and activate
additional platelets (2,3). Upon activation, glycopro-
tein (Gp) IIb/IIIa (αIIbβ3 integrin) mediates platelet
aggregation and spreading by means of ﬁbrinogen
bridges, which, once converted to ﬁbrin, ultimately
contribute to thrombus stabilization (4). This leads
to the formation of platelet-rich thrombi that, occlud-
ing the arterial lumen and impairing blood-ﬂow and
oxygen supply, cause acute ischemia (5).
The transduction of the ADP signal involves its
interaction with two platelet receptors belonging to
the P2 purinergic family, the Gαq-coupled receptor
P2Y1 and the Gαi-coupled receptor P2Y12. The con-
comitant activation of both the Gαq and Gαi path-
ways by ADP is needed for platelet aggregation
to occur. Signaling from the P2Y1 receptor causes
platelet shape change and rapid transient aggrega-
tion, whereas the signaling from the P2Y12 receptor
facilitates sustained irreversible aggregation and
stimulates surface expression of the pro-inﬂammatory

P-selectin (6). In addition, the P2Y12 receptor
plays a critical role in the ampliﬁcation of platelet
aggregation induced by agents other than ADP,
including 5-HT,TxA2, and thrombin.Together, these
contribute to thrombus growth and stability (5).
TxA2, generated from arachidonic acid by cyclo-
oxygenase 1 (COX-1) and Tx synthase, further
ampliﬁes platelet activation. COX-1 converts arachi-
donic acid into prostaglandin endoperoxides PGG2
and PGH2, the latter being, in turn, transformed by
Tx synthase into TxA2, a potent ampliﬁer of platelet
aggregation with vasoconstrictive properties. At the
site of the atheroma rupture, platelet-released TxA2
leads to downstream micro-vessel contraction and
thrombus propagation (7).
In addition to its role in coagulation, thrombin
at extremely low concentrations is one of the major
platelet activators (8). Human platelets express two
cell surface G-protein-coupled protease-activated
receptors (PARs) for thrombin: PAR-1 and PAR-4.
By binding the hirudin-like extracellular amino ter-
minal domain (the so-called thrombin receptor),
thrombin activates platelets and smooth muscle cells,
thus promoting platelet pro-coagulant activity, shape
change, secretion and release of agonists (ADP and
TxA2), expression of P-selectin, activation of the
αIIbβ3 integrin receptor, and aggregation. Thrombin
also binds to GpIbα on the surface of platelets,
thought to act as a co-factor that localizes the enzyme
on the platelet surface and accelerates the hydrolysis
of PAR-1 (9). PAR-1 and P2Y12 cross-react in plate-
let activation, and Gαq and Gαi-coupled receptors
are involved in this process. Thrombin-dependent
platelet aggregation is mediated in part by secreted
ADP, acting on the Gαi-linked ADP receptor. By
blocking Gαq via PAR-1 and Gαi via P2Y12, combined
inhibition of thrombin and P2Y12 receptors leads to
a synergistic inhibitory effect on thrombin-induced
platelet aggregation (10).
5-HT is a vasoconstrictor agent that binds to
5HT-2A receptors and ampliﬁes the platelet response
by stimulating shape change and enhancing platelet
recruitment at sites of injury (3). It may also play
a pro-coagulant role by promoting the retention
of ﬁbrinogen and thrombospondin on the platelet
surface. Intraplatelet 5-HT stores are implicated
in shear-induced platelet aggregation and thrombus
propagation (3).
Antiplatelet agents in clinical practice:
efﬁcacy, safety, limitations (Figure 1)
Three main classes of antiplatelet agents are licensed
for treatment of atherothrombosis: acetyl salicylic
acid (aspirin), P2Y12 inhibitors (ticlopidine, clopi-
dogrel, prasugrel, cangrelor, ticagrelor), and GpIIb/
IIIa receptor antagonists (abciximab, eptiﬁbatide,
and tiroﬁban) (11). While the last-mentioned are
only employed intravenously in ACS in combination
with other antithrombotic agents (their effect being
rather unpredictable when administered orally), the
former two classes are widely used chronically.
Aspirin
Owing to its efﬁcacy and favorable cost-effectiveness,
aspirin is the mainstay treatment for all atherothro-
mbotic conditions. The efﬁcacy of aspirin lies in its

ability to inhibit irreversibly platelet COX-1 (by acety-
lating a serine located near the active site of the enzyme)
and, in turn, TxA2 formation (12). A recent meta-
analysis by the Antithrombotic Trialists’ Collabora-
tion (13) assessed the role of aspirin in primary (95,000
subjects at low cardiovascular risk) and secondary
prevention (17,000 patients at medium/high risk)
and showed that, while in high-risk conditions the
advantages of aspirin outweigh the inherent bleeding
hazard, in primary prevention aspirin is associated with
an absolute beneﬁt of 0.06%/year, too exiguous as
compared to the 0.03% increase in major bleedings.
Ticlopidine
Ticlopidine was the ﬁrst agent of the thienopyridine
class shown both to prevent the interaction of ADP
with its platelet purinergic receptor and to determine
the inhibition of the binding of ﬁbrinogen to the
αIIbβ3 integrin (14). In subjects with a history of
cerebrovascular events, ticlopidine was superior to
placebo and to aspirin in the reduction of stroke,
AMI, or vascular death (15). In addition, the com-
bination of ticlopidine with aspirin was successful
in ACS patients undergoing percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI) with stent implantation (16).
Diarrhea, neutropenia, aplastic anemia, and throm-
botic thrombocytopenic purpura are the main
limitations for a wide-spread use of ticlopidine.
Clopidogrel
The thienopyridine prodrug clopidogrel irreversibly
binds the P2Y12 platelet receptor after a two-step
activation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) liver isoen-
zymes. While the CAPRIE trial (about 20,000 sub-
jects) (17) and a Cochrane systematic review (18)
showed that in patients with a history of AMI, stroke,
or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD),
clopidogrel administered alone was only marginally
superior to aspirin (RRR 8.7; Pϭ0.043) in prevent-
ing vascular events, a signiﬁcantly higher efﬁcacy has
been shown for the ‘dual antiplatelet therapy’. The
CURE (19) and the CREDO (20) studies estab-
lished the superiority of clopidogrel in combination
with aspirin versus aspirin alone in ACS and in ACS
with PCI, respectively.
Low response to aspirin or clopidogrel
Although antiplatelet treatment in high-risk patients
signiﬁcantly lowers non-fatal AMI (32%), non-fatal
Figure 1. Platelet activation pathways and drug molecular targets. Thrombin binds to PAR-1 receptor, which leads to shape change,
phospholipase C (PLC) activation, thromboxane A2 (TXA2) generation, and activation of the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor,
resulting in sustained platelet aggregation. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 catalyzes the production of TXA2, a potent platelet aggregator,
generated by platelets activated by thrombin and other agonists. Adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP) binds to its 7-transmembrane domain
receptors, P2Y1 and P2Y12, to activate platelets. P2Y1 is coupled to Gαq and G12. Gαq is linked to a signaling pathway involving PLC
activation, resulting in a rise in the intracellular calcium concentration ([Caϩ2]i) and protein kinase C (PKC) activation, leading to GP
IIb/IIIa activation and transient platelet aggregation. G12 mediates platelet shape change. P2Y12 is linked to Gαi-coupled signaling
cascades associated with adenylcyclase (Ac) down-regulation and decreased cyclic-3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) production, which
mediates GP IIb/IIIa receptor activation, leading to sustained platelet aggregation.

stroke (25%), and cardiovascular death (17%), a
residual vascular risk persists. After an AMI or a
stroke, in a long-term follow-up, 10%–20% of patients
with a history of an ischemic event develop recurrent
events in spite of their antiplatelet treatment (21).
Compared to aspirin-sensitive patients, the residual
platelet reactivity in subjects on antiplatelet therapy
correlates with a higher cardiovascular risk and pre-
dicts recurrent thrombotic events (22). In the HOPE
study, aspirin-treated patients in the highest quartile
of the urinary excretion of TxA2 metabolite had a
1.8-fold higher vascular risk than those in the lowest
quartiles (23). A meta-analysis (24) evaluated the
relation between a low laboratory response to clopi-
dogrel and the clinical outcome in ≈4,500 patients
with coronary artery disease (CAD) and PCI. Several
methods were used to assess platelet response to
therapy, and 26.4% of patients showed as low respond-
ers to clopidogrel.These patients showed a higher risk
of death/ischemic events as compared to that of patients
in whom a normal response was documented.
Although often secondary to a poor compliance
(25), a low treatment response (‘failure’) may be due,
at least in part, to an incomplete inhibition of platelet
function (26). Concomitant clinical conditions (dia-
betes mellitus, inﬂammation, hypercoagulable states,
low ﬁbrinolytic potential), high pretreatment platelet
reactivity (observed in ACS or in subjects with high
BMI), an increased platelet turn-over, and the simul-
taneous administration of some drugs (drug interac-
tion and/or inadequate drug absorption) are common,
major determinants of a low response to clopidogrel
or to aspirin (21,27).The possibility that, in addition
to such conditions, genetic variations play a role in a
low response to aspirin or to clopidogrel has also
been documented. Different haplotypes of COX-1
signiﬁcantly correlate with the response to aspirin
and with TxA2 generation in patients with stable
coronary artery disease (28).
A variety of polymorphisms in the CYP2C19
gene (most often the CYP2C19∗2), associated with
a 20%–25% production of inactive metabolite,
diminish the response to clopidogrel. Among sub-
jects under treatment with clopidogrel for a previous
vascular event, carriers of these polymorphisms have
a 50% higher risk of cardiovascular death, AMI, or
stroke (29). Among clopidogrel-treated patients,
carriers of at least one allele associated with the loss
of or a reduced function in the CYP2C19 gene had
a higher than normal occurrence of fatal and non-
fatal coronary thrombotic events, as well as of stent
thrombosis (29). In the same study population,
polymorphic alleles of a gene modulating clopi-
dogrel absorption (ABCB1) have been associated
with a higher rate of cardiovascular events at 1-year
follow-up as compared to wild-type subjects.
Overcoming limitations of aspirin
Changing doses and schedules of aspirin
Because inhibition of platelet aggregation by aspirin
is irreversible, the possibility of monitoring the entry
of newly formed platelets into the circulation (i.e. the
platelet turn-over) was documented by measuring
the recovery ofTxB2 biosynthesis after aspirin inges-
tion (30). The data show that platelets with intact
cyclo-oxygenase activity can be detected into the cir-
culation as early as 4–6 h after aspirin ingestion.
A higher than normal rate of entry of platelets into
the circulation has been documented in diabetic
angiopathy or in patients with coronary artery
bypass (31). Indeed, schedules of aspirin which may
sufﬁce in normal subjects are not effective in patients
with diabetic angiopathy, presumably because these
patients have a high rate of entry of new platelets
into the circulation (27). A long-lasting suppression
of thromboxane biosynthesis may be achieved by
repeated low-dose administrations or by slow-release
preparations of aspirin. The relevance of an acceler-
ated platelet turn-over as to ‘aspirin resistance’ has
been conﬁrmed in a series of clinical settings (32,33).
Attempts to improve the efﬁcacy of aspirin by
using larger doses have been associated with con-
trasting results (34). Moreover, a signiﬁcant higher
bleeding risk (mainly gastrointestinal) may occur
with higher aspirin doses. Thus, increasing the dose
of aspirin would expose the patient to a doubtful
clinical advantage (35).
Overcoming limitations of clopidogrel
Changing doses of clopidogrel
In spite of the greater antithrombotic efﬁcacy of
higher doses of clopidogrel, thrombotic events still
occur in 4.2% of patients (36).
Whereas a vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein
(VASP)-tailored clopidogrel loading dose has been
found to improve the clinical outcome (37) and to
reduce the rate of early stent thrombosis after PCI
(38), the GRAVITAS trial has been designed to evalu-
ate only the efﬁcacy and safety ofVASP-tailored clopi-
dogrel-maintaining regimens (39). Early results of the
study indicate that, compared with standard-dose,
high-dose clopidogrel only achieved a modest pharma-
codynamic effect in PCI patients with high residual
platelet activity. Moreover, 6-month higher-dose clopi-
dogrel did not reduce the rate of cardiovascular death,
non-fatal MI, or stent thrombosis, nor did it increase
severe or moderate bleeding. Thus the GRAVITAS
study does not support a treatment strategy of high
clopidogrel dose in PCI patients with high residual
activity, identiﬁed by a single platelet function test.
New antiplatelet drugs 535
Further strategies have been evaluated to over-
come clopidogrel limitations. Ω-3 Ethyl esters (1 g/day
for 1 month) added to standard dual antiplatelet
therapy signiﬁcantly lowered maximal platelet aggre-
gation in response to ADP andVASP phosphorylation
as well (40).
Cilostazol, selectively targeting phosphodiesterase
type 3 (PDE3) and, then, determining intracellular
cAMP accumulation, inhibits platelet aggregation
(41). In diabetic patients on standard dual antiplatelet
therapy, adjunctive treatment with cilostazol enhances
inhibition of platelet P2Y12 signaling (42).A Cochrane
review (43), in which two randomized studies on
stroke prevention were summarized, documented
that, compared with aspirin, cilostazol was associated
with a signiﬁcantly lower risk of vascular events
(6.77% versus 9.39%; RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.57–0.91,
composite outcome), and with a lower risk of hemor-
rhagic stroke (0.53% versus 2.01%; RR 0.26; 95%
CI 0.13–0.55). In terms of outcome of safety, cilostazol
was associated with signiﬁcantly fewer adverse events
(8.22% versus 4.95%; RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.51–1.83)
than aspirin. In the SILOAM phase IV study (Clini-
calTrials.gov Identiﬁer: NCT01261832), a triple
antiplatelet therapy (cilostazol plus aspirin and clopi-
dogrel) is compared (at 1 month and at 6 months)
with the standard dual antiplatelet treatment (ASA
and clopidogrel) in 951 ACS subjects (expected
number) undergoing PCI and drug eluting-stent
implantation. The primary efﬁcacy end-point is the
occurrence of major cardiovascular and cerebrovascu-
lar events (total death, non-fatal myocardial infarc-
tion, repeat revascularization, stroke).The end of the
study is expected by January 2013.

(Table II)
Prasugrel
Prasugrel, a prodrug of the thienopyridine family,
after a rapid one-step conversion into a highly
bioavailable metabolite, causes an irreversible block
of the P2Y12 ADP receptor. Because of a distinct
chemical structure, the conversion to its active
metabolite is less dependent on speciﬁc cytochrome
P450 enzymes than that of other thienopyridines
(44). A phase I study (45) evaluated the inhibition
of ADP-induced platelet aggregation by prasugrel
(60 mg loading and 10 mg repeated doses) as com-
pared to clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose and 75
mg repeated doses). In platelets exposed to ADP,
inhibition of the aggregation and the onset of the
antiplatelet effect were higher for prasugrel than for
clopidogrel (maximal inhibition achieved 30–60 min
and 4–6 hours after prasugrel and clopidogrel,

respectively). Of interest, the number of ‘non-
responders’ was signiﬁcantly lower with a 60-mg
loading dose of prasugrel than with a 300-mg
loading dose of clopidogrel (0% versus 42%).
A phase II dose-ranging trial, the JUMBO-TIMI
26 (46), compared clopidogrel and prasugrel regi-
mens in 900 patients undergoing elective or urgent
PCI plus stenting. Patients were randomized to one
of three combinations of prasugrel loading and
maintenance doses: 40 mg and 7.5 mg/d, 60 mg and
10 mg/d, and 60 mg and 15 mg/d, or to the standard
clopidogrel regimen (300 mg and 75 mg/d). While
the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI)
major bleeding was similar between prasugrel and
clopidogrel groups, subjects receiving prasugrel
showed a lower incidence of the composite end-
point of 30-day major adverse cardiac events. Like-
wise, signiﬁcantly lower rates of coronary target
vessel thrombosis were seen in prasugrel-treated
patients.The PRINCIPLE-TIMI 44 (47) was a ran-
domized, double-blind, two-phase cross-over trial of
prasugrel compared with high-dose clopidogrel in
201 patients undergoing a planned PCI. In the ﬁrst
phase, a 60-mg prasugrel loading dose was com-
pared with a 600-mg loading dose of clopidogrel.
After the loading dose, the subjects received prasu-
grel 10 mg or clopidogrel 150 mg for 14 days, and
then they were crossed over to the alternative treat-
ment for an additional 14 days. The primary end-
point was the inhibition of platelet aggregation at
6 hours following 20 μmol/L ADP. After the loading
dose, the inhibition of platelet aggregation at 6 hours
was signiﬁcantly greater in the patients receiving
prasugrel than in those on clopidogrel. In addition,
patients on prasugrel showed more consistent levels
of platelet inhibition, a lower interindividual vari-
ability, and a reduced incidence of low response as
compared to those on clopidogrel.The same ﬁgures
were conﬁrmed after 14 days of maintenance ther-
apy. Thus, both the 60 mg loading dose and the
maintenance dose of 10 mg of prasugrel were supe-
rior to clopidogrel regimen in inhibiting P2Y12-
dependent platelet aggregation.As to safety ﬁndings,
no TIMI major bleeding event occurred after the
loading dose in either group, whereas two subjects
(2.0%) in the prasugrel group and no subject in
the clopidogrel group experienced a TIMI minor
bleeding episode before the cross-over.
The TRITON-TIMI 38 (48) was a randomized,
double-blind, parallel-group, multinational phase III
trial comparing the efﬁcacy and safety of prasugrel
and clopidogrel in 13,608 subjects with ACS under-
going PCI and coronary stenting. Patients were
randomized to receive prasugrel (60-mg loading
dose followed by a 10-mg/day maintenance dose)
or clopidogrel (300-mg loading dose followed by
a 75-mg/day maintenance dose) for a mean of
14.5 months.The primary efﬁcacy end-point (death
from CV causes, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke)
occurred in 643 patients (9.9%) receiving prasugrel
and in 781 patients (12.1%) receiving clopidogrel
(hazard ratio (HR) 0.81; 95% CI 0.73–0.90;
Pϭ0.001). An early signiﬁcant difference in the pri-
mary end-point was also documented at the 3-day pre-
speciﬁed time point, a ﬁnding consistent with a more
rapid onset of the antiplatelet activity of prasugrel

(43). Such difference was maintained from the third
day to the end of the study. The difference in the
primary end-point was found both among patients
with unstable angina and non-STEMI and STEMI
subjects, the reduction in AMI being the major deter-
minant of such difference. In addition, regardless of
the type of stent, a signiﬁcant 52% reduction of stent
thrombosis was found in the prasugrel group (49).
Vis-à-vis a 2.2% reduction in fatal and non-fatal
ischemic events, both TIMI major and minor bleed-
ing episodes were 1.2% more frequent with prasug-
rel than with clopidogrel. The TIMI major bleeding
was observed in 2.4% of subjects in the prasugrel
group and in 1.8% in the clopidogrel group.The rate
of life-threatening bleeding (1.4% versus 0.9%;

in the clopidogrel group, with maximal bleeding
risk in patients with a history of stroke/TIA (in
whom this drug should be avoided, being associated
with increased intracranial hemorrhage), in elderly
patients (agedՆ75 years) and in those with a body-
weightϽ60 kg. On the other hand, based on TIMI

ting. Together, in a risk/beneﬁt analysis, prasugrel
was 13% better than clopidogrel (HR 0.87; 95% CI
0.79–0.95; Pϭ0.004), maximal clinical beneﬁt being
found in patients with diabetes, with coronary stents,
or with recurrent events (RRR 30%). Whether pra-
sugrel is safer and better than clopidogrel in reduc-
ing the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke,
in patients with ACS who are medically managed,
and in whom no revascularization is planned, will be
evaluated in the TRILOGY ACS study, a phase III
multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled
trial including approximately 10,000 patients (50).
Cangrelor
Cangrelor, an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analog
with a high afﬁnity for the P2Y12 receptor (35), does
not need conversion, being immediately active fol-
lowing infusion (half-life of 3–6 min). In the STEP-
AMI trial, 92 ACS patients (51) treated with aspirin
and heparin were randomized to receive cangrelor
(280 μg/kg/min) alone, full-dose tissue plasminogen
activator (t-PA) alone, or cangrelor (35, 140, or
280 μg/kg/min) in combination with half-dose t-PA.
A 60-min coronary patency similar to that of full-dose
t-PA alone and a greater patency than with cangrelor
alone was found in patients receiving the combina-
tion of cangrelor and half-dose t-PA. Although in
two randomized controlled clinical phase III trials
on ACS patients requiring PCI (CHAMPION PCI,
CHAMPION PLATFORM) (52,53), cangrelor did
not show superiority over clopidogrel, this drug is
currently investigated as a bridge to CABG surgery
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identiﬁer: NCT00767507).
Ticagrelor
Ticagrelor, an orally active cyclopentyl-triazolo-
pyrimidine, binds to domains of the P2Y12 receptor
other than those recognized by ADP (the 1, 2,
and 7 transmembrane domains, the extracellular
loop 2, and the N-terminal domain), determining
a potent and rapid non-persistent receptor confor-
mational change. After the occupancy of P2Y12,
ADP-catalyzed conversion of cAMP from ATP,
dephosphorylation of phosphorylated VASP, and
activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase are blocked.
The net result is a reduced exposure of ﬁbrinogen-
binding sites on the αIIbβ3 integrin receptor and, in
turn, the inhibition of platelet aggregation. Inhibi-
tion of ADP-mediated constriction of vascular
smooth muscle and enhancement of adenosine-
induced coronary blood-ﬂow are also reported. After
oral administration, ticagrelor is rapidly absorbed
and does not require hepatic biotransformation
to be pharmacologically active. However, ticagrelor
is also metabolized to an equipotent, active metabo-
lite (AR-C124910XX) by CYP3A4 enzymes. Being
both ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX-excreted by
the intestinal route, no dose adjustment is needed
in kidney failure. On the other hand, the concomi-
tant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers as well as a
signiﬁcant liver dysfunction may be of concern for
its use (54). After pharmacodynamic evaluations
(55,56), a 90-mg twice daily dose of ticagrelor
has been chosen to optimize its efﬁcacy, safety, and
tolerability. A loading dose of 180–270 mg may
minimize intersubject variability as to initial inhibi-
tion in platelet aggregation and may be appro-
priate in ticagrelor-naive patients with ACS or in
preparation for PCI.
In 174 subjects with a recent coronary artery
disease receiving 75–100 mg/day aspirin (92 also
under ticagrelor 180-mg load and 90 mg/twice daily
maintenance dose, and 82 also under clopidogrel
600-mg load and 75 mg/d maintenance dose) the
genotyping of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19
(∗1,∗2,∗3,∗4,∗5,∗6,∗7,∗8,∗17) was performed. In addi-
tion, platelet function was measured by aggregom-
etry, VerifyNow P2Y12 assay, and VASP assay at
pre-dose, 8 hours post-loading, and during mainte-
nance. There was no signiﬁcant effect of the geno-
type on platelet function during aspirin therapy
alone. On the other hand, irrespective of the 2C19
genotype, of the metabolizer status, and of the assays
538 M. N. D. Di Minno et al.
employed, subjects on ticagrelor showed a lower
platelet reactivity than did those on clopidogrel
(P Ͻ 0.01). This is consistent with a genotype-
independent better pharmacodynamic effect of
ticagrelor as compared to clopidogrel (57).
The DISPERSE trial (200 subjects with stable
atherosclerotic disease) (54) showed ticagrelor
(100 mg/b.i.d., 200 mg/b.i.d., or 400 mg/d) to inhibit
platelet aggregation more rapidly and effectively and
with less variability than clopidogrel (75 mg/d).The
DISPERSE-2 trial (58) (990 NSTEMI patients)
showed that ticagrelor, added to standard medical
treatment, has a safety proﬁle similar to clopidogrel
with a better proﬁle as to the incidence of AMI,
silent AMI, severe recurrent ischemia, stroke, and
death. However, the study was not powered to
detect differences in efﬁcacy end-points (size), nor
was the duration of the drug exposure appropriate
(52).
The PLATO trial was a phase III, multicenter,
randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study
that evaluated the efﬁcacy and safety of ticagrelor
and of clopidogrel in lowering the risk of vascular
events in more than 18,000 NSTEMI or STEMI
patients (59). Within 24 hours after a diagnosis
of ACS, the patients were randomized to receive
ticagrelor 90 mg/twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg
once daily for 6–12 months. Before starting the
maintenance dose, each subject received a loading
dose of 180 mg ticagrelor or 300 mg clopidogrel,
depending on the group of randomization. All sub-
jects received concomitant treatment with aspirin
75–100 mg/day. The primary outcome of the study
was the time to the ﬁrst occurrence of cardiovascu-
lar or cerebrovascular death, non-fatal MI, or non-
fatal stroke. The primary safety outcome was the
time to the ﬁrst occurrence of any major bleeding
event.At 12 months, the primary end-point occurred
in 9.8% of patients receiving ticagrelor as compared
with 11.7% of those receiving clopidogrel (HR 0.84;
95% CI 0.77–0.92; PϽ0.001). Similar ﬁgures were
achieved by evaluating the rate of the primary out-
come at 30 days (4.8% for ticagrelor group versus
5.4% for clopidogrel group; Pϭ0.045). The rate of
death from any cause was also reduced with ticagre-
lor (4.5% versus 5.9% with clopidogrel; PϽ0.001).
Major, life-threatening, or fatal bleedings did not
differ between those on ticagrelor and on clopi-
dogrel (11.6% and 11.2%, respectively; Pϭ0.43),
nor did CABG-related major bleeding, although
ticagrelor patients were allowed to undergo CABG
earlier (24–72 hours), after withdrawing from the
study drug, as compared to those on clopidogrel
(5 days). However, vis-à-vis fewer fatal bleeding
episodes of other types, a higher rate of higher
major bleeding not related to coronary artery bypass
grafting (4.5% versus 3.8%; Pϭ0.03), including
fatal intracranial bleedings, were detected in subjects
on ticagrelor.Secondary end-point evaluation showed
signiﬁcant differences in the rates of myocardial
infarction (5.8% in the ticagrelor group versus 6.9%
in the clopidogrel group; Pϭ0.005) and of death
from vascular causes (4.0% versus 5.1%; Pϭ0.001),
but not of stroke (1.5% versus 1.3%; Pϭ0.22).
More patients in the ticagrelor group discontin-
ued the study drug due to adverse events compared
to the clopidogrel group (7.4% versus 6.0%;
PϽ0.001). A signiﬁcantly higher reversible increase
in serum uric acid and creatinine was found in
subjects receiving ticagrelor. Dyspnea, nausea,
hypotension, and asymptomatic ventricular pauses
were more frequent in the ticagrelor group, maybe
because of an adenosine-mediated response (60).
Thus, the use of ticagrelor should be evaluated with
caution in patients with hyperuricemia, bradyar-
rhythmias without pacemakers, and syncope and in
those at high risk of bleeding (e.g. elderly, low body-
weight, renal dysfunction) and avoided in patients
with history of stroke (61). Of interest, in the ONSET/
OFFSET study, 123 patients with stable coronary
artery disease receiving aspirin (75–100 mg/d)
received on top ticagrelor (180-mg load, 90-mg b.i.d.
maintenance dose (nϭ57)), clopidogrel (600-mg
load, 75-mg/d maintenance dose (nϭ54)), or placebo
(nϭ12) for 6 weeks. Ticagrelor achieved a more
rapid and greater platelet inhibition (evaluated with
20 μmol/L ADP) than did high-loading-dose clopi-
dogrel. In addition, a faster offset occurred with
ticagrelor than with clopidogrel (4–72-hour slope
(% inhibition of platelet aggregation/h) –1.04 versus
–0.48; PϽ 0.0001) (62). To evaluate further the
safety and efﬁcacy parameters, in a phase III study
(NCT01294462) 90 mg/twice daily ticagrelor (on
top of 100 mg aspirin) will be compared to
75 mg clopidogrel (on top of 100 mg aspirin as well)
in ACS subjects with a planned PCI. The safety
outcome will be evaluated by measuring the time to
ﬁrst occurrence of any major bleeding event. The
time to ﬁrst occurrence of the composite of death
from any vascular cause (myocardial infarction and
stroke) will also be measured.
The study is expected to enroll 800 subjects, and
the estimated study completion date is August 2012.
In addition, a randomized phase III PEGASUS
trial (NCT01225562), on an expected number of
21,000 subjects with a history of myocardial infarc-
tion, will evaluate the efﬁcacy of ticagrelor (90 or
60 mg/twice daily) compared to placebo on top of
aspirin (100 mg) in the prevention of the compos-
ite end-point of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI,
or non-fatal stroke.The end of the study is expected
by February 2014.
New antiplatelet drugs 539
Elinogrel
Elinogrel (PRT128) is a direct, reversible P2Y12
inhibitor available in both oral and intravenous for-
mulations. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial (63) in which single intravenous
doses (1–40 mg) were administered, elinogrel yielded
a dose-dependent, complete inhibition of ADP-
induced aggregation. All doses of elinogrel were well
tolerated, with no serious adverse events observed.
Sarpogrelate
Sarpogrelate is a selective inhibitor of 5-HT platelet
receptors. In the S-ACCESS trial (64), 1,510 patients
with recent cerebral infarction were randomly
assigned to receive either sarpogrelate (100 mg t.i.d.)
or aspirin (81 mg/day). Mean follow-up was 1.59
years, with the recurrence of a cerebral infarction
as primary efﬁcacy end-point. Clusters of serious
vascular events (stroke, acute coronary syndrome,
or vascular death) were secondary end-points. The
aim of the primary efﬁcacy analysis was the non-
inferiority of sarpogrelate with respect to aspirin,
the upper limit of the 95% CI of the hazard ratio
for the recurrence of cerebral infarction not exceed-
ing 1.33. Cerebral infarction recurred in 72 patients
in the sarpogrelate group and in 58 in the aspirin
group (HR 1.25; 95% CI 0.89–1.77; Pϭ0.19). A
serious vascular event occurred in 90 and in 85
patients, respectively (HR 1.07; 95% CI 0.80–1.44;
Pϭ0.65). The overall incidence of bleeding events
was 89 (11.9%) and 131 (17.3%), respectively
(PϽ0.01).
DZ-697b
DZ-697b inhibits collagen and ristocetin-mediated
platelet adhesion and aggregation and does not
require metabolization to generate its active com-
pound (65).The antithrombotic effect and the bleed-
ing time prolongation of three DZ-697b doses were
compared with 300 mg clopidogrel in 20 healthy
subjects randomized to a single oral dose of DZ-697b
(60, 120, and 360 mg) or clopidogrel (300 mg).
DZ-697b (120 mg) showed antithrombotic effects
comparable to 300 mg clopidogrel, with signiﬁcantly
reduced bleeding time prolongations.
Atopaxar (E5555)
Atopaxar (E5555) is a small molecule, 1-(3-tert-
butyl-4-methoxy-5-morpholinophenyl)-2-(5,6-diethoxy-
7-fluoro-1-imino-1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2yl)
ethanone hydrobromide that acts as PAR-1 antagonist.
In healthy volunteers, E5555 showed antiplatelet
effects without increasing bleeding times. Two ran-
domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II
clinical trials (J-LANCELOT) (66) have assessed
the safety and tolerability of atopaxar in addition
to standard therapy in patients with ACS or high-
risk coronary artery disease. In addition to aspirin,
patients received atopaxar (50 mg, 100 mg, or
200 mg) or placebo once daily for 12 or 24 weeks.
All atopaxar doses tested achieved a signiﬁcant level
of platelet inhibition with no increase in severe
bleeding episodes. The rate of major cardiovascular
adverse events in the atopaxar group was similar to
placebo (ACS 6.6% and 5.0% in placebo or E5555,
respectively, Pϭ0.73; CAD 4.5% placebo versus
1.0% E5555, Pϭ0.066).
Vorapaxar
Vorapaxar (SCH 530348) is an orally active and
reversible agent belonging to the class of thrombin
receptor antagonists (TRAs). Vorapaxar blocks the
platelet PAR-1 receptor,inhibiting thrombin-induced
activation and aggregation of platelets without affect-
ing thrombin-induced ﬁbrin production. Phase I
study data showed a signiﬁcant dose-related inhibi-
tion of platelet aggregation withϾ90% inhibition at
1 h, lasting at least 72 h in the absence of signiﬁcant
adverse events (67). The TRA-PCI (68), a random-
ized, double-blind, multicenter phase II study, was
designed to assess tolerability and safety of an oral
loading dose of vorapaxar (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg)
in patients undergoing coronary angiography with
planned PCI. In addition to the standard of care
(aspirinϮclopidogrel), those who subsequently
underwent PCI received an oral maintenance dose
(0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, or 2.5 mg/day) of vorapaxar or
placebo for 60 days. The primary end-point was the
incidence of clinically signiﬁcant major or minor
bleeding according to the TIMI scale. In spite of the
limited time of observation (60 days) versus the very
long half-life (100–360 h) of vorapaxar, no difference
in the primary end-point of major or minor bleeding
has been found (2%, 3%, 4% in the three loading
dose groups versus 3.3% in placebo group; Pϭ0.57).
Nor were signiﬁcant differences in major cardiovas-
cular events observed in the two groups. Platelet
function testing showed a very potent and sustained
effect with the 40-mg loading dose and the 2.5-mg
maintenance dose. In a subgroup of subjects under-
going coronary bypass surgery while under vora-
paxar, there was no evidence of increased bleeding,
suggesting that PAR-1 blockade during cardiopul-
monary bypass may ‘preserve’ normal hemostasis
(69). In a phase II study (70), 117 NSTEMI patients
undergoing non-urgent PCI have been randomized
to receive, on top of standard dual antiplatelet
540 M. N. D. Di Minno et al.
therapy (aspirinϩticlopidine) and heparin, two dif-
ferent dosages of vorapaxar (20 mg or 40 mg loading
dose, followed by 1 mg/d or 2.5 mg/d maintenance
dose) or placebo. While TIMI major and minor
bleedings were similar between the different treat-
ment arms (14% versus 10%), peri-procedural AMI
was signiﬁcantly lower in treated patients (16.9%
versus 42.9 in the placebo group %; Pϭ0.013).
Two large multicenter, international, prospective,
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical
trials were designed to establish the potential role
of vorapaxar in treatment of CAD patients. TRA∗
CER (71) is a prospective, randomized, double-blind,
multicenter phase III trial designed to determine
whether vorapaxar (40-mg loading dose, followed by
2.5 mg daily for at least 1 year) can lead to further
reduction in ischemic events when added to stan-
dard medical treatment in NSTEMI patients. As an
estimate, 19,000 subjects are required to achieve
adequate power. Primary composite end-point is
the effect on cardiovascular death, AMI, stroke,
recurrent ischemia with hospitalization, urgent
PCI, and bleeding.
TRA 2°P-TIMI 50 (72) will evaluate the efﬁcacy
and safety of vorapaxar during long-term treatment
of patients with established atherosclerotic disease
receiving standard therapy (up to 27,000 patients).
The study targeted patients with a documented his-
tory of AMI or stroke within 2 weeks to 12 months
before the time of inclusion. Patients with peripheral
artery disease (PAD) are eligible for inclusion if
they have intermittent claudication in conjunction
with an ankle-brachial indexϽ0.85 or previous
revascularization for limb ischemia. Participants are
randomized to receive vorapaxar (2.5 mg daily) or
placebo in addition to standard therapy for at least
1 year. The primary composite end-point is cardio-
vascular death, AMI, stroke, or urgent coronary
revascularization, whereas the evaluation of long-
term safety includes bleeding events deﬁned by the
GUSTO and TIMI criteria.
Future antiplatelet drugs
In addition to the antiplatelet drugs reported above,
there is a continuous effort to identify newer targets
toward which to direct pharmacological strategies.
Gas6 (growth arrest-speciﬁc gene 6), a member
of the family of vitamin K-dependent proteins, is
stored in platelet α granules and is released upon
activation (73). Although it has a 44% sequence
homology with protein S, it does not show any anti-
coagulant activity (74). Being a growth factor-like
molecule,as it interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs) of the Tyro3, Axl, and MerTK (TAM)
family, Gas6 employs a unique mechanism of action,
interacting through its vitamin K-dependent Gla
module with phosphatidylserine-containing mem-
branes and through its carboxy-terminal LG domains
with the TAM membrane receptors. Studies indicate
an association between Gas6 and stroke. Inhibition of
Gas6 function can be achieved by Gas6-neutralizing
antibodies, by proteases cleaving the extracellular
domain of Gas6 receptors, or by inactivation of
RNA for Gas6 or Gas6 receptors. Antibodies to the
carboxy-terminal part of Gas6, responsible for the
binding to its receptors, inhibit the aggregation of
human platelets induced by ADP (75).
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved
in tissue remodeling and in the progression of athero-
sclerosis (76). Human platelets contain MMP-2 in
their cytosol and release them upon aggregation (77).
Active MMP-2, potentiating phosphoinositide-3
kinase activation, ampliﬁes platelet aggregation
induced by a variety of agonists in an aspirin- or
ADP-receptor antagonist-independent fashion (78).
MMP-2-neutralizing antibodies have shown protec-
tive effects in hearts exposed to ischemia–reperfusion
injury (79). MMP-2 gene-silencing techniques (80)
may be exploited to gain cell-selective MMP-2
inhibition.
The CD40 ligand (CD40L; CD154) is a trans-
membrane protein expressed on the surface of acti-
vated platelets. Following its exposure, an exodomain
(soluble CD40 ligand, sCD40L) is released and
binds to integrin αIIbβ3 on activated platelets, thus
promoting thrombus stabilization (81). Therapeutic
targeting of the CD40-CD40L axis using humanized
anti-CD40L antibodies has already been attemp-
ted (82). Shedding of sCD40L from the surface of
activated platelets can be prevented by an anti-
CD40L antibody (G28-5). This may reduce plasma
concentrations of sCD40L and, in turn, blunt plate-
let reactivity (83). In addition to the production by
platelets, PGE2 is also produced by other cells in
blood, including monocytes. Low concentrations of
PGE2 potentiate platelet aggregation by priming
protein kinase C activation and by inhibiting ade-
nylylcyclase. The facilitating effects of PGE2 on
platelets are mediated by EP3 (84,85). In animal
studies, DG041, a novel ﬁrst-in-class antagonist of
EP3, effectively inhibits platelet aggregation without
increasing the bleeding time (86). In a phase II trial
in patients with peripheral arterial disease, DG041
was found to reduce platelet activation (87).
Conclusions
Major limitations of current antiplatelet drugs
include risk of bleeding, signiﬁcant interindividual
variability in the response, and extended duration
of action that cannot be reversed if the need for
New antiplatelet drugs 541
hemostasis or emergency surgery arises. Newer anti-
platelet drugs have addressed some but not all these
limitations. Dual antiplatelet treatment has only
been efﬁcacious in acute coronary syndromes. In
addition, newer thienopyridines did not show advan-
tages over and above those of ticlopidine or clopi-
dogrel as to reduction of stroke. Because of its
pharmacodynamic characteristics, prasugrel is more
efﬁcacious in preventing ischemic events in patients
with ACS undergoing PCI, but with increased bleed-
ing complications. The same concept is true for
ticagrelor. Platelet activation by thrombin is distinct
and appears to be less important for hemostasis than
ﬁbrin generation (preclinical data). Accordingly,
inhibition of PAR-1 function rather than inhibition
of ﬁbrin generation or activity may provide a newer
strategy for treatment of thrombotic disorders
in humans (88). Individual bleeding risk, however,
has to be further deﬁned, as this would be the ﬁrst
antiplatelet drug in which a greater efﬁcacy is not
associated with a worse safety (greater bleeding
tendency).
A concerted effort that takes into consideration
clinical, genetic, and laboratory information repre-
sents a major direction to be pursued in order
to tailor the therapeutic approach for individual
patients. The results of on-going clinical trials and
the identiﬁcation of further potentially useful targets
for antiplatelet treatment (87) will hopefully help
address this issue.

Note
While this manuscript was under revision, results
from LANCELOT-CAD were published (Circulation.
2011;123:1854–1863). In this study patients with a
history of high-risk CAD were randomized to receive
50, 100, or 200 mg daily atopaxar or matching
placebo for 24 weeks and followed up for an addi-
tional 4 weeks. Although no difference was found as
to major bleeding events, overall bleeding incidence
(key safety end point) showed a dose-dependent
trend in the atopaxar arm as compared with placebo
by CURE criteria (p for trendϭ0.01) but not by
TIMI criteria (p for trendϭ0.07). As to the major
adverse cardiac events occurrence (secondary end
points), no signiﬁcant difference was found between
the atopaxar treatment arms and placebo (2.6% vs
4.6%; pϭ0.20). In addition, a transient elevation
in liver transaminases and dose-dependent QTc
prolongation without apparent complications were
observed in higher-dose atopaxar treatment groups.
