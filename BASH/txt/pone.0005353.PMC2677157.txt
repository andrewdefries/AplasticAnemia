Abstract
Background: Recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) is usually administered
by injection, and its oral administration in a clinical setting has been not yet reported. Here we demonstrate the
bioavailability of orally administered rhGM-CSF in healthy volunteers. The rhGM-CSF was expressed in Bombyx mori
expression system (BmrhGM-CSF).
Methods and Findings: Using a single-dose, randomized, open-label, two-period crossover clinical trial design, 19 healthy
volunteers were orally administered with BmrhGM-CSF (8 mg/kg) and subcutaneously injected with rhGM-CSF (3.75 mg/kg)
respectively. Serum samples were drawn at 0.0h, 0.5h ,0.75h,1.0h,1.5h,2.0h ,3.0h,4.0h,5.0h,6.0h,8.0h,10.0h and 12.0h after
administrations. The hGM-CSF serum concentrations were determined by ELISA. The AUC was calculated using the
trapezoid method. The relative bioavailability of BmrhGM-CSF was determined according to the AUC ratio of both orally
administered and subcutaneously injected rhGM-CSF. Three volunteers were randomly selected from 15 orally
administrated subjects with ELISA detectable values. Their serum samples at the 0.0h, 1.0h, 2.0h, 3.0h and 4.0h after the
administrations were analyzed by Q-Trap MS/MS TOF. The different peaks were revealed by the spectrogram profile
comparison of the 1.0h, 2.0h, 3.0h and 4.0h samples with that of the 0.0h sample, and further analyzed using both Enhanced
Product Ion (EPI) scanning and Peptide Mass Fingerprinting Analysis. The rhGM-CSF was detected in the serum samples
from 15 of 19 volunteers administrated with BmrhGM-CSF. Its bioavailability was observed at an average of 1.0%, with the
highest of 3.1%. The rhGM-CSF peptide sequences in the serum samples were detected by MS analysis, and their sizes
ranging from 2,039 to 7,336 Da.
Conclusions: The results demonstrated that the oral administered BmrhGM-CSF was absorbed into the blood. This study
provides an approach for an oral administration of rhGM-CSF protein in clinical settings.

Introduction
Recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimu-
lating factor (rhGM-CSF) acts on precursor cell proliferation in
bone marrow. It also stimulates granulocytes, monocytes, and
colony formation; and induces hyperplasy of macrophages [1] .
This protein is primarily used in bone marrow transplantation,
tumor chemotherapy, and the treatment of aplastic anemia and
agranulocytosis related to AIDS [2–6]. The rhGM-CSF is an
acidoglycoprotein containing 127 amino acid residues and has
a molecular weight of 14.4 kDa to 32 kDa [7]. It can be
expressed in Escherichia coli, yeast, and mammalian cells [8,9].
Currently, the rhGM-CSF is administered by injection in
clinical settings.
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 5 | e5353
We expressed hGM-CSF in silkworm pupae bioreactor named as
BmrhGM-CSF. It was purified and determined to have molecular
weigh of 29 kDa [7,10,11]. It’s post-translational modifications
were characterized in addition to its glycosylation [7,10,11]., The
oral formulation of BmrhGM-CSF was used in our previous animal
study. The results from preclinical studies demonstrated that orally
administered BmrhGM-CSF could function as an active cytokine
[10]. The orally administered BmrhGM-CSF was shown to be
absorbed into blood of mice, beagles, and macaques, which
increased leukocyte counts. (1) In hematogenesis-inhibited mice,
orally administered BmrhGM-CSF stimulated the colony formation
in hemopoietic tissues on the spleen surface and DNA synthesis in
the bone marrow. The effect was similar to that of injected
Leucomax. (2) Hematogenesis-inhibited beagles treated with 60
Co
and orally administered BmrhGM-CSF had white blood cell counts
reached 50% of their baseline values by 9th
day, and recovered to
the normal levels by 12th day. Moreover, the percentage of new
granulocytes and promyelocytes in the bone marrow increased
significantly. (3) The oral administration of BmrhGM-CSF to
cyclophosphamide-treated macaques increased leukocyte produc-
tion in a manner similar to that of Leucomax injections [10].
BmrhGM-CSF also promoted the production of granulocytes in
macaques and beagles, and increased leukocyte counts in a dose-
dependent manner. Western blotting analysis indicated that
BmrhGM-CSF could be absorbed into blood through the
intestinal parva [10].
The results from preclinical animal stuies have proven that
BmrhGM-CSF could penetrate into the blood as an active
cytokine through the oral administration [10]. In this paper, we
report the results of the bioavailability of the orally administered
BmrhGM-CSF in a clinical trial.
Methods
The protocol for this clinical trial and supporting CONSORT
checklist are available as supporting information; see Protocol S1
and Checklist S1.
Participants
A total of 22 male volunteers were screened for inclusion at 2nd
Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, School of Medicine
(Hangzhou, China). Participants were considered eligible if they
met the following criteria:
(1) apparently healthy;
(2) 18–40 years of age;
(3) no liver, kidney, gastrointestinal and metabolic disorders, or
neuropsychiatric diseases;
(4) no medical history, drug allergies history or smoking or
alcoholic drinking;
(5) 18 kg/m2

;
(6) with good communication between researchers, to comply
with the requirements of the entire study and
(7) with signed informed consent and conducted a comprehensive
history and physical examination and laboratory tests
including blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature
measurements, blood examination, urine analysis, blood
biochemistry and ECG, etc.
Exclusion criteria were:
(1) participating in other clinical trials in last 2 weeks;
(2) donating blood during the trial period or within last 1 month;
(3) not accepting physical examination;
(4) drug allergy or a history of allergic disease;
(5) history of drug abuse and
(6) with any chronic or acute disease.
The test and reference formulations
The test formulation was the BmrhGM-CSF capsule for the oral
administration provided by Zhejiang Chinagene Biopharmaceu-
tical Co., Ltd. Each capsule contained 60 mg of BmrhGM-CSF.
The reference formulation was the rhGM-CSF for subcutaneous
injection (150 mg/bottle) purchased from Guangzhou Baidi
Biotechnology Co., Ltd .The rhGM-CSF for subcutaneous
injection was expressed in E. coli. The subcutaneous injection site
was at upper arm deltoid. Both the test and reference formulations
were stored at 4uC.
Ethics
Phase I trial was registered with http://www.chictr.org
(ChiCTR-TRC-00000107). We conducted the study in accor-
dance with good clinical practice guidelines, provisions of the
Declaration of Helsinki, and regulations of the People’s Republic
of China. The protocol and consent forms were approved by the
ethics committee of 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University,
School of Medicine. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board
monitored adverse events and confirmed the end points of the
experiments if investigators observed adverse events. The written
informed consent was obtained from all volunteers.
Interventions
In a single-dose, randomized, open-label, two-period crossover
clinical trial, 20 volunteers were divided into two groups, 10 for
each. These groups were designated TR (Test Formulation/
Reference Formulation) and RT (Reference Formulation/Test
Formulation), respectively. Of which, 10 volunteers in the TR
group was orally administered with BmrhGM-CSF (8 mg/kg) on
Day 1. After a 7-day washout period, the subcutaneous injection of
the reference formulation, rhGM-CSF (3.75 mg/kg) was given to
each subject of the same TR group on Day 9. The same protocol
was performed, vice versa, for the RT group as described in the
participant flow chart (Figure 1). After fasting overnight for at least
10 h till 8:00 am on the following day, the subjects designated for
the oral administration were given BmrhGM-CSF with 200 ml
warm boiled water. The subjects designated for the subcutaneous
injection were given the injection at the upper arm deltoid with
rhGM-CSF. Followed by a 4-h period, all of the volunteers in both
groups had the same low-fat meal. During the trial study, the
subjects did not smoke or drink alcohol, caffeine-containing
beverage, or fruit juice in order to avoid any possible interference
on the absorption and metabolism of the drug. The administration
order for the subjects depended on random drawn numbers. The
administration intervals between subjects depended on the length
of time required for withdrawing blood samples for 2 to 3 min.
Objectives
The primary goals of the study were to: (1) investigate the
bioavailability of orally administered BmrhGM-CSF in healthy
volunteers; (2) demonstrate the presence of rhGM-CSF peptides in
serum of volunteers orally administered with BmrhGM-CSF.
Outcomes
The hGM-CSF concentrations in the blood serum. Blood

syringe after drug administration at 0.0h, 0.5h, 0.75h, 1.0h, 1.5h,
2.0h, 3.0h, 4.0h, 5.0h, 6.0h, 8.0h, 10.0h and 12.0h. The blood
samples were drawn into EDTA-coated anticoagulation tubes,
mixed thoroughly, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm. Then serum
samples were collected and stored at 4uC for use. The hGM-CSF
concentrations in the sera were determined by ELISA within 12h
after collection. Human GM-CSF ELISA kits were purchased
from Jingmei Bioengineering Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). In order to
reduce pilot error, these human GM-CSF ELISA kits used were
the same lot. The tests were performed according to the
instruction of the ELISA kit. Briefly, a standard curve was
generated as follows: a solution containing 2000 ng/L of hGM-
CSF was prepared, and standard curve calibrators containing 7.8,
15.6, 31.2, 62.5, 125.0, 250.0, 500.0, and 1000.0 ng/L of hGM-
CSF were generated by a serial dilution. The OD values of the
standard curve calibrators, quality controls and samples tested
were determined at a wavelength of 450 nm. The hGM-CSF
concentrations of the tested samples were measured by the
regression analysis with the CVXPT32 software.
MS Analysis. The serum samples collected from 3 volunteers
at the 0.0h, 1.0h, 2.0h, 3.0h , 4.0h after the oral administration of
BmrhGM-CSF and the subcutaneous injection of rhGM-CSF
were subjected to MS analysis (Q-Trap MS/MS TOF, ABI Co.) .
Those 3 were randomly selected from 15 ELISA detectable
subjects. The serum samples were diluted by 100-fold with 80%
acetonitrile and the solution was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for
10 min. The supernatant was collected for MS analysis. The 0.0h
sample analysis spectrogram was used as control and compared
with the analysis spectrogram of 1.0h, 2.0h, 3.0h and 4.0h hour
sample in order to obtain peaks with different mass-to-electric
charge ratios. Further analysis of the peaks through both
Enhanced Product Ion (EPI) scanning and Peptide Mass
Fingerprinting Analysis concluded that the molecular weight and
amino acid sequences of these peptides matching hGM-CSF
fragments.
Randomization. In a single-dose, randomized, open-label,
two-period crossover clinical trial, 20 enrolled participants were
randomly assigned to two groups (TR and RT) in a 1:1 ratio.
Briefly, a randomization code was developed using a computer-
generated randomization schedule (Compaq Visual Fortran
version 6.5, IMSL Fortran Library, Compaq Computer Corp.,
Houston, Texas) by a biostatistician. After preparing a random
sequence, subjects were allocated to the two trial groups by a
physician who was not involved in the main research. During the
process of allocation, each subject was given a unique
identification code (Unique Identifier, UI). This UI was used as
a label to uniquely identify the subject’s group after completion of
the study. During the study period this UI was given to the main

researchers together with the necessary treatment for each
participant. Both test and reference formulations of the rhGM-
CSF were designed for either oral or subcutaneous administration
in both RT and TR groups. Specifically, the test formulation of
BmrhGM-CSF was orally administered to the TR group on Day
1. After a 7-day washout period, the reference formulation of
rhGM-CSF was subcutaneously injected on Day 9. Conversely, for
the RT group, the reference formulation of rhGM-CSF was
subcutaneously injected on Day 1. After a 7-day washout period,
the test formulation of BmrhGM-CSF was orally administered on
Day 9.
Statistical analysis. The bioavailability was defined in
accordance with the in vivo bioequivalence guidance criteria
established by the US Food and Drug Administration [12]. That
states it is the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or
active moiety is absorbed from a drug product and becomes
available at the site of action of the formulations tested. An analysis
of variance (ANOVA) for a 262 crossover design in ln-
transformed Cmax, AUC0,12 and AUC0,‘ was performed to
determine the bioavailability. The 90% CIs for the corresponding
differences in Cmax, AUC0,12 and AUC0,‘ were calculated.
ANOVA was performed using the F ratio. The probability (P) of
exceeding the limits of acceptance (80%–125%) was obtained by
two 1-sided t tests described by Schuirmann [13] . The 2 drug
formulations were considered bioequivalent if the geometric mean
ratios of the Cmax and AUC were within the predetermined range
of 80% to 125% and if P for the 90% CIs was ,0.05 [12].
Statistical analysis of the drug product pharmacokinetics was
carried out using WinNonlin version 5 (Pharsight Corporation,
Mountain View, California).
Results
Participant Flow
Originally 22 healthy male volunteers were assessed for
eligibility from September, 2005 to January, 2006 in Hangzhou
City, Zhejiang Province. Two of them were subsequently excluded
because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. The twenty
volunteers were randomly divided into the TR and RT groups.
One of them withdrew the consent resulting in 19 volunteers being
analyzed for the primary outcome (Figure 1).
Bioavailability
The blood hGM-CSF concentrations of 19 volunteers were
determined by ELISA before and after the oral administration of
BmrhGM-CSF. Of which, 15 showed significant detectable
amount but 4. Figure 2 shows the time course of the average
rhGM-CSF serum concentration of 19 subjects who received a
single dose of either test BmrhGM-CSF or reference rhGM-CSF.
Two hours after the oral administration of BmrhGM-CSF, its
absorption peak increased to the amount of 40.1 ng/L. It then
returned to the baseline level over the next 10 h.
The values of the hGM-CSF in the sera and time points were
fitted using the DASVer 2.0 software. The pharmacokinetics of
each of the components was consistent with the two-compartment
model. The area under the curve (AUC), Cmax, and Tmax for the
test and reference formulations were calculated using the statistical
moment method, and the related pharmacokinetic parameters are
shown in Table 1.
The AUC was calculated using the trapezoid method. The
AUC ratio of the test formulation to the reference formulation
demonstrated an average bioavailability of the rhGM-CSF in the
19 subjects was 0.61% after oral administration. However, 4 of
them showed an undetectable serum concentration of the rhGM-
CSF resulting in their AUCs could not be calculated. If these
subjects were excluded from the statistic analysis, thus the average
bioavailability of the other 15 subjects could reach 1.0%; one of
them showed the highest bioavailability of 3.1%.
MS Tracings
Based on the bioavailability data analyses above, the serum
samples from three of 15 subjects were used for the MS analyses.
Those samples were randomly selected from 15 ELISA detectable
subjects that were subjected to either the oral administration of
BmrhGM-CSF or the subcutaneous injection of rhGM-CSF. The

MS tracings of the 3 subjects as supplementary data were shown in
supporting information files ( Table S1, S2, S3 and Figure S1, S2,

S18, S19, S20, S21, S22, S23, S24, S25, S26, S27, S28 ). Here,
serum MS tracing from one of the 3 volunteers was briefly
described as follows:
Using the 0 hour MS data as control, the results of Enhanced
Mass Spectrometry (EMS) and EPI analysis suggested that there
were differential peaks of the mass-to-electric charge ratio in the
serum samples after the oral administration of BmrhGM-CSF or
injection of rhGM-CSF (Table 2 and Table 3). Peptide mapping
based on the molecular weights demonstrated the presence of
hGM-CSF peptide fragments in the differential peaks (Figure 3
and Figure 4). The molecular weights of those different
polypeptides were ranged from 2,039 to 7,336Da, which indicated
that orally administered BmrhGM-CSF could be absorbed into
the blood after penetrated through the intestinal tract.
Discussion
An oral administration of protein drugs was considered as a
focus area in the study of biological pharmaceuticals worldwide.
To date, authentic oral administration of protein drugs has not yet
been successfully achieved. Most cytokines and proteins including
hGM-CSF, interferon and insulin, were found to be effective when
delivered by either intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. If

these drugs could be effectively administered through the oral
administration in clinical settings, the biological pharmaceuticals
industry would be revolutionized.
Several challenges could be encountered in the effective oral
administration of protein and cytokine drugs which include a poor
intrinsic permeability, a hostile proteolytic environment in the
gastrointestinal tract, effects of the liver, and short in vivo half-lives
[14] . Many pharmacologists have been trying to solve these
problems. Previous methods for the oral administration of
vulnerable pharmacological agents relied on the co-administration
of adjuvants (e.g., resorcinol and nonionic surfactants such as
polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and n-hexadecyl polyethylene ether) to
artificially increase the permeability of the intestina1 walls.
Enzymatic inhibitors such as pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and
trasylol were also co-administered to inhibit enzymatic degrada-
tion [15]. Liposome or microsphere was also used as drug delivery
systems for insulin and heparin [16] . Over the past few decades,
significant efforts have been made to develop effective oral peptide
and protein formulations, and these have met with various degrees
of success. Some modified polypeptides or cytokines such as rIL-
12, Ile-Pro-[14
C] Pro, rhG-CSF and insulin were shown to be
active after oral administration in animal models [14,17–20].
Several oral preparations of polypeptides and cytokines such as
Colostrinin and interferon-alpha have been or still are in a clinical
research phase [21–24]. However, the bioavailability of protein
and cytokine drugs after oral administration in human has rarely
been reported.
Foreign genes have been expressed in high level in the silkworm
bioreactor. The expressed products possess native-like properties.
Additionally, the expressed proteins could be suitably phosphor-
ylated and glycosylated in the bioreactor [25,26] . Silkworm pupa
also harbors an abundance of liposome containing protease
inhibitors that protect recombinant proteins from degradation in
the gastrointestinal tract [27–32]. That allows increased absorp-
tion of protein drugs and cytokines, for example, BmrhGM-CSF
after the oral administration.
The development of protein drugs that could survive the
journey through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and then penetrate
the bloodstream of the body is a major issue in the pharmaceutical
field. Several kinds of protein drugs for oral administration have
been genetically engineered. Those include liposome-encapsulated
proteins, nanosphere conjugated proteins and fusion proteins
which facilitate absorption through the GI tract [14,17–20,24] .
Yet, most of studies are still processing in the stage of animal
studies [17–20] . It is important to provide experimental proofs at
the molecular level to support the theory for the effectiveness of
orally administered cytokine drugs or proteins in clinical settings.
To achieve this goal, we have carried out a number of preclinical
and clinical studies. Here we specifically discuss the clinical data
on the bioavailability of BmrhGM-CSF:
In the bioavailability trial, ELISA was used to determine the
hGM-CSF concentrations in sera. Using the 19 volunteers, the
average hGM-CSF concentration reached its plateau level at 2 h
after the oral administration of a single dose of BmrhGM-CSF.
The average bioavailability was approximately 1%, and the
highest of 3.1%. The blood hGM-CSF concentrations of 19
volunteers were detected by ELISA before and after oral
administration of BmrhGM-CSF, but it was not detected in 4 of
the 19 ones. This indicated that BmrhGM-CSF could not be
absorbed by 4 of 19 subjects. However, BmrhGM-CSF could be
absorbed by 79% subjects tested. This might result from individual
differences.
The result of MS analysis demonstrated that both small and
large hGM-CSF peptide fragments were absorbed into the blood
after the oral administration of BmrhGM-CSF, which is in
accordance with that of an isotope hybridization test [10].
In this study, we developed a method for the oral administration
of protein or cytokine drugs expressed in the silkworm (B. mori)
bioreactor. The absorption of orally administered rhGM-CSF
produced in B. mori bioreactor was acceptable, indicating that
BmrhGM-CSF may have potential clinical applications. This
paper may provide an approach for the oral administration of
cytokine and protein drugs.
