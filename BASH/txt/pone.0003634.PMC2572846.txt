Abstract
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most frequent viral complication in patients after allogeneic stem cell
transplantation. As CMV replication is tightly controlled by the cellular arm of specific immunity, the kinetics of CMV-
specific T cells in association with individual reactivation episodes were prospectively analyzed in 40 allogeneic transplant
recipients in a routine clinical setting and evaluated as determinant of impaired CMV control. Antigen-specific CD4 and CD8
T cells were quantified directly from whole blood using intracellular cytokine staining after specific stimulation and MHC
class I multimers, respectively. Highly dynamic intraindividual changes of CMV-specific CD4 T cells were observed in patients
experiencing CMV viremia. Episodes of CMV reactivation were associated with a drop of CMV-specific CD4 T cells that re-
increased after viral clearance (p,0.0001). Furthermore, levels of CMV-specific CD4 T cells at the onset of viremia inversely
correlated with peak viral load thereafter (p = 0.02). In contrast, CMV-peptide specific CD8 T cells did not show any
association with viremia (p = 0.82). Interestingly, therapeutic dosages of cyclosporine A and corticosteroids led to a dose-
dependent reduction of CMV-specific T-cell functions, indicating a causal link between intensified immunosuppressive
treatment and CMV reactivation. In conclusion, levels of CMV-specific CD4 T cells inversely correlate with reactivation
episodes and may represent a valuable measure to individually guide antiviral therapy after stem cell transplantation.

Introduction
CMV specific T-cell immunity represents the key guardian for
the prevention of CMV reactivation. Impaired immune reconsti-
tution of CMV specific T cells after allogeneic stem cell
transplantation disturbs this otherwise effective equilibrium
between host defense and viral replication thereby contributing
to an increased susceptibility to CMV replication and potentially
life threatening CMV disease [1–5]. Although the elimination of
CMV infected cells is directly mediated by functionally active
CMV specific CD8 T cells [6–8], the need for CMV specific CD4
T-cell help to maintain or even promote the generation of virus-
specific CD8 T cells has clearly been demonstrated in observa-
tional studies [9] and interventional trials of adoptive T-cell
transfer in stem cell transplant recipients [10–13].
In recent years, intracellular cytokine induction and MHC class
I multimer technology for the detection of CMV specific CD4 and
CD8 T cells [1,3,7,8,10,14–16], respectively, have largely replaced
traditional cytotoxicity and lymphoproliferation assays [6,9,11,17]
with the advantage of a rapid and sensitive quantitation and
functional characterization of antigen-specific T cells. These
technical advances have now opened novel opportunities to assess
the individual immunocompetence towards CMV in a routine
clinical setting [18]. We have previously shown, that a whole
CMV antigen-based stimulation of CMV specific CD4 T cells
allowed for a very sensitive and specific identification of the
individual CMV status [19]. Moreover, a progressive functional
impairment [20] and a decrease in the level of CMV specific CD4
T cells correlated with impaired CMV control in patients after
renal, heart and lung transplantation [21,22]. Thus, quantitation
of CMV specific T cells allowed the identification of patients with
sufficient, insufficient or absent T-cell immunity and may therefore
serve as diagnostic tool to facilitate decisions on antiviral therapy.
Several promising studies suggest that similar immunological
control mechanisms may play a role in patients after hematopoi-
etic stem cell transplantation [8,9,15,23,24]. However, currently
available studies were either restricted to single antigenic epitopes
or a subgroup of patients with a certain HLA type. Moreover, in
most studies, CMV specific T-cell immunity was analyzed far less
frequently as compared to routine viral load monitoring that is
usually performed on a weekly or biweekly basis.
In this study the relationship between CMV specific CD4 and
CD8 T-cell immunity and CMV replication was prospectively
investigated in a routine clinical setting in patients after allogeneic

stem cell transplantation. Similar to our findings in renal
transplant recipients, CMV specific CD4 T-cell levels showed
considerable fluctuations in viremic patients and inversely
correlated with CMV load. In contrast, respective T-cell
frequencies in non-viremic individuals were rather stable.
Together with the fact that CMV specific CD8 T cells enumerated
using MHC class I pentamers did not show any association with
viral load, these findings emphasize the potential use of CMV
specific CD4 T-cell monitoring to identify patients at risk for viral
complications and to facilitate decisions on antiviral therapy.
Results
Incidence of CMV viremia and acute GvHD
We have studied 40 recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplants
(table 1) of whom 35 patients (87.5%) reconstituted CMV specific
T-cell immunity after transplantation. 29 episodes of CMV
viremia were observed in a total of in 21 patients (1 to 4 per
patient) occurring after a median of 53 days (32–182 days) post
transplantation, including two patients with CMV disease (one
patient with CMV pneumonia and one patient with CMV
gastrointestinal disease). Acute GvHD developed in 29/40
recipients (72.5%) after a median of 17.5 days post transplantation.
Among those, 58.6% (17/29) consecutively became CMV-DNA
positive. Moreover, 4/11 recipients (36.3%) without acute GvHD
became viremic (p = 0.29), suggesting that factors other than acute
GvHD may be relevant to promote CMV replication. In line with
previous observations [16], CMV viremia developed more often in
recipients of grafts from a CMV seronegative donor (9/11, 81.8%)
as compared to patients receiving grafts from a CMV seropositive
donor (12/29, 41.4%; p = 0.03).
Dynamic changes in CMV specific CD4 T-cell numbers in
viremic patients
CMV specific CD4 T cells of stem cell transplant recipients
were prospectively analyzed and correlated to CMV-DNA. CMV
specific CD4 T cells were identified by upregulation of CD69 and
induction of IFN-c after stimulation with a whole CMV lysate.
Stimulation with control antigen or SEB served as negative or
positive controls, respectively (figure 1A). A strong correlation was
found between the induction of IFN-c and TNF-a after
stimulation with CMV antigen (figure 1B, r = 0.96, p,0.0001)
and SEB (r = 0.91, p,0.0001, data not shown), thus indicating a
simultaneous induction of Th1 cytokines after specific stimulation.
To dissect the impact of CMV specific CD4 T cells on viral
control, the number of CMV specific CD4 T cells was analyzed in
viremic patients and compared to patients that did not experience
viremia after CMV specific T-cell immunoreconstitution. As
shown in representative examples, CMV specific CD4 T-cell levels
showed a considerable fluctuation in relation to viremia (white
circles in figure 1C), whereas respective T-cell levels in patients in
periods of sufficient CMV control were rather stable (figure 1D).
Consequently, when analyzing the variation of CMV specific T-
cell levels over time, the standard deviation (SD) of normalized
mean CMV specific CD4 T cells in patients with prolonged
viremia varied to a larger extent (viremic, mean SD = 2.0
log2(ml21
)) as compared to recipients with stable CMV control
(non-viremic, mean SD = 1.1 log2(ml21
); p,0.0001, figure 1E).
Interestingly, CMV specific CD8 T-cell frequencies quantified
using a panel of peptide-bound MHC class I pentamers were
rather stable and did not show any fluctuations in relation to
viremic episodes (black circles in figure 1B and C). As a
consequence, the standard deviations of normalized mean
numbers of CMV specific CD8 T cells over time did not differ
between viremic and non-viremic patients (mean SD = 1.5
log2(ml21
) in viremic versus mean SD = 1.1 log2(ml21
) in non-
viremic patients, p = 0.45, data not shown). Thus, dynamic
changes in absolute levels of CMV specific CD4 T cells are
characteristic features of patients experiencing CMV replication.
To more closely address the changes in CMV specific T-cell
immunity in relation to viral load over time, CMV specific CD4
T-cell numbers were analyzed in patients at various stages before,
during and after viremia. The group of transplant recipients who
were never viremic served as a control population (figure 2A, white
circles). Median CMV specific CD4 T-cell numbers in non-
viremic patients reached 10.49 cells/ml (range 1.35–69.73 cells/
ml). In contrast, CMV specific CD4 T-cell levels at the onset and
during viremia were significantly lower (1.07 cells/ml, range 0.13–
39.31 cells/ml and 0.85 cells/ml, range 0.13–36.33 cells/ml, re-
spectively) and re-increased after resolution of viremia (4.40 cells/
ml, range 0.48–74.81 cells/ml). Interestingly, CMV specific T-cell
levels already started decreasing before detection of viral load
(.14 days before viremia: 5.87 cells/ml, range 0.55–71.91 cells/
ml; ,14 days before viremia: 2.64 cells/ml; range 0.13–
31.78 cells/ml). This indicates that CMV specific CD4 T-cell

levels closely correlate with viral replication and may even serve as
a measure to predict viremia well before its onset. Interestingly,
similar kinetics were observed when the time course of viral load
was related to the median number of total CD4 T cells irrespective
of specificity (figure 2B). While these findings may indicate some
diagnostic value of total CD4 T-cell levels as a rough surrogate
parameter to judge the individual immunocompetence towards
CMV, the decrease upon viremia, however, was far less
pronounced as compared to that observed for CD4 T cells
specific for CMV (3.0fold decrease in median CD4 T cells vs.
12.4fold decrease in median CMV specific CD4 T cells between
non-viremic patients and patients during viremia).
To analyze a potential association between the level of CMV
specific T cells and its impact on viral control, the number of
CMV specific CD4 T cells at the onset of viremia (63 days) was
related to the peak CMV copy number during viremia in a total of
25 infectious episodes (in 4 episodes, no CMV specific CD4 T-cell
analysis was performed within the 63 days period of the onset of
viremia). Interestingly, high numbers of CMV specific CD4 T cells
inversely correlated with peak CMV-DNA copy number during
viremia (r = 20.45, p = 0.02, figure 2C). Thus, although correla-
tion was only moderately tight, this indicates that the counts of
CMV specific T cells at the onset of viremia critically impinge on
the extent of CMV replication thereafter.
Combined immunosuppression with cyclosporine A and
methylprednisolone contributes to a decrease in CMV
specific CD4 T-cell function
Stem cell transplant recipients who experience acute GvHD
receive corticosteroids in addition to their established cyclosporine
A (CyA) based immunosuppressive drug regimen. As this
intensified treatment may favour viral replication, the direct
impact of therapeutic levels of these immunosuppressive drugs on
antigen-specific effector functions was analyzed in a whole blood
test (figure 3, n = 6 healthy CMV seropositive individuals). The
suppressive effect of 180 ng/ml cyclosporine A in the presence or
absence of 0.4, 2, or 10 ng/ml of methylprednisolone (MP,
equivalent to 0.4 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) was analyzed
on CMV specific induction of IFN-c (figure 3A) and on CMV
specific T-cell proliferation (figure 3B) after 36 h of stimulation.
Incubation with cyclosporine A reduced the percentage of IFN-c
positive CD4 T cells from 0.8760.52% to 0.5560.37%. The
addition of methylprednisolone led to a further decrease in a dose
dependent manner (0.3760.27%, 0.2860.20%, and 0.3160.25%
for 0.4, 2 and 10 ng/ml MP; p = 0.007, figure 3A). Similarly, the
percentage of BrdU positive T cells after CMV specific stimulation
was reduced upon incubation with CyA and MP, although this
reduction did not reach statistical significance (figure 3B).
Together these data illustrate that immunosuppressive drugs and
drug combinations in clinically relevant concentrations contribute
to a direct suppression of T-cell function.
Levels of CMV peptide specific CD8 T cells do not
correlate with viremia
Having shown a significant association of a drop in CMV
specific CD4 T cells with an increase in viremia as compared to a
considerable stability of CMV specific CD8 T-cell levels, the
respective relationship of CMV specific CD8 T cells with viral
replication was analyzed in a subpopulation of 15 transplant
recipients with a panel of five CMV peptide-bound MHC class I
pentamers. Based on the requirement for matching of the
individual HLA status, between one and four different penta-
mer-peptide complexes could be analyzed per patient. Typical
dotplots of pentamer stainings of CD8 T cells of an HLA-A2 and
HLA-B7 positive patient are depicted in figure 4A (see also patient
in figure 1C, middle panel). Although fewer episodes of CMV
viremia (n = 9) have been studied using MHC class I pentamers,
neither CMV specific nor total CD8 T-cell numbers showed any

significant decrease upon viremia (figure 4B, p = 0.82 and 0.22,
respectively). Moreover, as shown for two patients recognizing two
and three peptides, respectively, CMV specific CD8 T-cell
responses to single pentamer-peptide complexes within one patient
may show profound differences in kinetics over time (figure 4C).
Thus examples exist, where the CD8 T-cell responses towards
single peptides are continuously rising prior to onset of viremia
and thereafter (see left panel, HLA-A*0201-NLV), whereas the
response towards other peptides decreases before viremia and
increases thereafter (peptides HLA-A*0201-VLE or HLA-A*0101-
YSE). Together this indicates that monitoring of CMV specific
CD8 T cells using MHC class I multimer staining may be of
limited use to identify patients at risk for viral reactivation.
Interestingly, however, although numerically stable, CMV specific
CD8 T cells in SCT patients exhibit some signs of functional
impairment, as the expression of the programmed death 1 (PD-1)
receptor on CMV specific CD8 T cells was significantly higher as
compared to the whole CD8 T-cell population (Figure 4D, mean
values of PD-1 expression on CD8 T cells recognizing the two
HLA-A2 binding peptides versus PD-1 expression on whole CD8
T cells, p,0.0001). In contrast, there was no significant difference
between the percentage of PD-1 expressing CMV specific CD8 T
cells and PD-1 positive pan T cells in healthy individuals
(Figure 4E, p = 0.19).
Discussion
CMV is among the most frequent causes of infectious
complications after allogeneic stem cell transplantation [2,4,5].
To our knowledge, this is the first study to prospectively analyze
the linked dynamics of CMV specific T cells and viral load in a
routine clinical setting. The incidences of CMV viremia and acute

GvHD in our cohort were comparable to other previously
published studies [8,9]. In line with previous reports [8,15,23], a
high proportion (87.5%) of patients were found to reconstitute
CMV specific CD4 T-cell immunity after transplantation.
Interestingly, when analyzing CMV specific CD4 T-cell dynamics
over time, viremic patients showed considerable intraindividual
variations, whereas CMV specific CD4 T-cell frequencies in non-
viremic patients were rather stable. These dynamic changes were
closely associated with viral load in that lowest frequencies of
CMV specific CD4 T cells were found at the onset of and during
viremia. Moreover, frequencies of specific CD4 T cells at the start
of viremia inversely correlated with peak viral load thereafter.
These findings are well in line with our previous observations in
solid organ transplant recipients, where a drop in CMV specific
CD4 T-cell frequencies correlated with increased viral replication
and stable frequencies were associated with efficient viral control
[21,22].
Several factors may contribute to the decrease in CMV specific
CD4 T cells over time. As intensified immunosuppressive
treatment of acute GvHD is often associated with an increased
incidence of CMV viremia [1], immunosuppressive drugs may
directly affect CMV specific T-cell frequencies and/or –reactivity
[8]. This is supported by our observation that clinically relevant
concentrations of cyclosporine A and corticosteroids that were
added directly to whole blood led to a dose-dependent decrease in
both cytokine production as well as proliferation of CMV specific
T cells. Thus, CMV specific T cells may be functionally impaired
thereby contributing to an altered balance between specific
immunity and viral replication [20]. This increase in viral
replication may in turn lead to a progressive decrease of specific
T cells over time. This decrease may be a result of both an
increased recruitment to the sites of infection as well as a drug-
related decrease in the proliferative capacity of CMV specific CD4
T cells. Interestingly, levels of total CD4 T cells irrespective of

specificity were also lowest in patients at the onset of and during
viremia. Although this may indicate some diagnostic value of total
CD4 T-cell numbers as a rough surrogate parameter for the
individual immunocompetence towards CMV, the difference
between non-viremic and viremic patients was far more
pronounced for the subset of CD4 T cells specific for CMV.
Functionality of antigen-specific T cells seems to be an essential
prerequisite for efficient viral control [25]. When comparing
kinetics of CMV specific CD4 and CD8 T cells, there was no
association between the level of CMV specific CD8 T cells and
viral load. In this study, CMV specific CD4 T cells were
functionally identified by the specific activation and induction of
INF-c or TNF-a after a 6-hour stimulation. The use of a whole
antigen lysate allows for a very sensitive and specific detection of
CMV specific CD4 T cells independent of the patients HLA status
[19]. Recently, stimulation by the use of in vitro generated
autologous dendritic cells infected with CMV has been evaluated
as an elegant means to quantify CMV specific T cells from stem
cell transplant recipients in clinical routine [23,24]. While this
approach is attractive as it allows for a simultaneous quantitation
of CMV specific CD4 and CD8 T cells, it seems more time
consuming due to the need of cell purification, generation and
infection of dendritic cells, and overnight stimulation. In this study,
CMV specific CD8 T cells were quantified by the use of peptide-
bound MHC class I multimers. Although this approach represents
the most rapid technology to enumerate antigen specific CD8 T
cells [18], restriction to certain HLA types and requirements for
knowledge of peptide epitopes precludes the widespread use of
MHC class I multimers in a routine clinical setting. Some patients
may even show intraindividually different dynamics in CD8 T cells
specific for individual peptide epitopes (figure 4C). Moreover, the
lack of association between CMV specific CD8 T-cell frequencies
and viral load indicates its limited use as parameter to identify
patients at risk for viral reactivation. This may mainly be due to
the fact that MHC class I multimer staining enumerates CMV
specific CD8 T cells without addressing functionality. Thus, it is
tempting to speculate whether a drop in functionally active CD8 T
cells would be indicative of viremia. In this respect, it has indeed
been shown that most CMV specific CD8 T cells in patients with
reactivation are functionally impaired [24], especially during
episodes of GvHD with high-level corticosteroid therapy [8]. In
line with this evidence of functional anergy, we found a
significantly increased expression of the PD-1 molecule on CMV
specific CD8 T cells as compared to the total fraction of CD8 T
cells. This molecule has recently been shown to be expressed on
anergic T cells towards various chronic viral pathogens such as
HIV [25], HCV [26], or LCMV in mice [27]. Thus, as with other
chronic infections, efficient control of CMV replication seems to
critically depend on the extent of functional anergy of antigen-
specific T cells [20]. Ultimately, severe functional anergy and/or
total loss of functional T cells may eventually contribute to
uncontrolled virus replication and development of disease [20,21].
Interestingly, functional anergy of both CMV and LCMV specific,
PD-1 positive T cells was shown to be reverted upon blockade of
PD-1 with its ligands [20,27]. As this was associated with improved
control of viral replication in vivo [27], the manipulation of
antigen-specific T cells in vitro or in vivo will represent a novel
therapeutic approach to improve T-cell function in chronic viral
infections.
In the era of improved patient management and effective
antiviral therapy [28], the occurrence of early CMV disease
complications has dramatically declined and is often delayed
towards later time points [9]. These late reactivations events have
a high mortality [9] and are difficult to manage in a routine
ambulatory setting. Our study on the linked kinetics of CMV
specific CD4 T cells and viral load suggests that the monitoring of
CMV specific CD4 T cells may represent a valuable approach to
identify individual reactivation events in patients after CMV
specific immunoreconstitution. As CMV specific CD4 T cells
already started decreasing when viral load was still below detection
limit, specific T-cell monitoring may even help to identify patients
at risk for viral reactivation well before onset of viremia. So far,
most studies that analyzed CMV specific T-cell responses after
stem cell transplantation were limited by the use of single antigenic
epitopes or HLA restriction as well as by considerably broad study
intervals where individual reactivation episodes may not always
have been closely accompanied by concomitant T-cell analyses.
The technology used in this study can be widely applied in a
routine clinical setting, as it can be performed from low volumes of
whole blood within one day and no restriction for HLA status or
knowledge of antigenic epitopes is required. Applications are
widespread and could allow for an individualized targeting and
timing of antiviral therapy that may avoid overtreatment and
attendant toxicities [29,30]. Although preemptive therapy in our
study was guided by CMV load only, the correlation between the
level of CMV specific CD4 T cells at the onset of viremia with
peak viral load thereafter suggests, that CMV specific CD4 T-cell
frequencies may be applied to guide both the initiation or deferral
of antiviral therapy. Indeed, as shown for renal transplant
recipients, stable levels of CMV specific T cells were not only
typical for non-viremic patients but may also be used to identify
patients, where antiviral therapy may be deferred despite
detectable viral load [21]. A similar strategy was recently applied
in a small series of allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients where
the decision to defer antiviral therapy was based on the presence of
CMV specific immunity post transplant [31]. None of the patients
developed CMV disease. In this study, however, T-cell levels were
only determined at 3, 4.5 and 6 months after transplantation.
Given the intraindividual dynamics of CMV specific T cells, it is
tempting to speculate whether potential overtreatment could
further be minimized by a therapeutic decision that is based on the
determination of CMV specific CD4 T-cell immunity at the onset
of viremia. Similarly, as a treatment-related decrease in viral load
was associated with an increase in CMV specific CD4 T cells, the
duration of antiviral drug therapy may be guided by the individual
recovery of CMV specific CD4 T cells thereby limiting side effects
of prolonged antiviral drug exposure.
In conclusion, CMV specific CD4 T-cell levels show an inverse
association with CMV viremia. Monitoring of CMV specific CD4
T cells on a routine basis may help to predict uncontrolled CMV
viremia after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and may in
future be used as important clinical tool to identify both high-risk
patients and patients who may not need antiviral therapy. Clearly,
this should be explored in a prospective randomized clinical trial
as it is currently being performed in patients after renal
transplantation in our transplant center.
Materials and Methods
Patient characteristics
A total of 40 allogeneic transplant patients were recruited from
October 2002 to September 2005. Patient characteristics and
demographic data are shown in table 1. Monitoring for CMV-
DNA from peripheral blood was performed weekly or biweekly
during inpatient treatment and at outpatient visits thereafter.
Antiviral treatment included prophylactic application of acyclovir
and preemptive therapy with ganciclovir or foscarnet. Monitoring
of CMV-specific T cells from 1.5 ml of whole blood was

performed weekly during inpatient treatment and at outpatient
visits thereafter. CMV disease was defined according to established
criteria [32]. Six CMV seropositive healthy control persons
(39.065.5 years of age) were recruited to analyze the effect of
immunosuppressive drugs on T-cell reactivity and proliferation in
vitro. Seven CMV seropositive HLA-A2 positive healthy control
persons (39.8614.7 years of age) were analysed for PD-1
expression on CMV specific CD8 T cells. The study was approved
by the local ethics committee (‘‘Ethikkommission der A¨ rztekam-
mer des Saarlandes’’) and all patients gave informed consent.
Consent to use 1.5 ml of blood for the study was obtained on a
verbal basis as blood was drawn upon clinically indicated
venipunctures only.
Quantitation of CMV specific CD4 T cells
Quantitation of CMV specific CD4 T cells was performed
directly from whole blood (450 ml/sample) as described before
[19,21,22]. Briefly, titered amounts of CMV antigen (32 ml/ml;
Virion, Wu¨rzburg, Germany) were used as stimulus in the
presence of 1 mg/ml anti-CD28 and anti-CD49d (clones L293
and 9F10; BD, Heidelberg, Germany), respectively, to induce
antigen-specific activation and cytokine induction. As negative and
positive controls, cells were stimulated with control antigen
(Virion), and 2.5 mg/ml Staphylococcus aureus Enterotoxin B (SEB,
Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), respectively. Blood was incubated
in 15 ml-polypropylene tubes at 37uC at 6% CO2 for a total of
6 h. During the last 4 h 10 mg/ml of brefeldin A (Sigma) was
added to block secretion of cytokines. Thereafter the blood was
treated with 2 mM EDTA for 15 minutes. Subsequently,
erythrocytes were lysed and leukocytes were fixed for 10 minutes
using BD lysing solution (BD). Cells were washed once with FACS
buffer (PBS, 5% filtered FCS, 0.5% BSA, 0.07% NaN3) and
immunostained in FACS buffer containing 0.07% saponin (Sigma)
using anti-CD4 (clone SK3), anti-CD69 (clone L78), anti-IFNc
(clone 4S.B3), anti-TNFa (clone MAb11, all antibodies from BD).
Samples were analyzed on a FACS Calibur (BD) using Cellquest
Pro software. Absolute numbers of CMV specific CD4 T cells/ml
whole blood were calculated based on differential blood counts.
To analyze the effect of immunosuppressive drugs on T-cell
reactivity and proliferation, whole blood was preincubated for two
hours with various dosages of steroids and/or cyclosporine A and
stimulated with CMV antigen for a total of 36 hours. After
6 hours, an equal volume of RPMI supplemented with 1%
glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 0.5% human serum
albumine was added. Proliferation was assessed by incorporation
of 500 mM bromo-desoxy uridine (BrdU, Sigma) that was added
after 28 hours. The last 4 hours of incubation were carried out in
the presence of 10 mg/ml brefeldin A. Thereafter, samples were
treated as described above and stained for CD4, IFN-c and BrdU
(clone B44, BD).
Quantitation of CMV specific CD8 T cells
Quantitation of peptide-specific CD8 T cells from HLA-
A*0101, HLA-A*0201, and/or HLA-B*0702 positive patients
was performed from whole blood using the following MHC class I
pentamers (bound peptide sequences and amino acid positions
within pp65 are shown in brackets): HLA-A*0101-YSE
(YSEHPTFTSQY, HCMV pp65 363–373), HLA-A*0201-NLV
(NLVPMVATV, HCMV pp65 495–504), HLA-A*0201-VLE
(VLEETSVML, HCMV IE1 316–324), HLA-B*0702-TPR
(TPRVTGGGAM, HCMV pp65 417–426), HLA-B*0702-RPH
(RPHERNGFTVL, HCMV pp65 265–275). Staining was per-
formed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ProImmune,
Oxford, UK). Pentamer binding was visualized using anti-
Pentamer PE and cells were co-stained using CD8 APC (clone
SK1, BD). PD-1 expression on CMV specific CD8 T cells from
HLA-A*0201 positive patients was assessed from leukocytes frozen
over time and analyzed as a batch. PD-1 (clone MIH4, FITC, BD)
was stained together with CD8 (clone SK1, APC) and HLA-
A*0201-tetramers bound to peptides NLVPMVATV and
VLEETSVML (Orpegen Pharma, Heidelberg, Germany).
Determination of CMV serostatus and viral load
The CMV serostatus was determined by a commercial CMV
IgG test (CMV IgG PKS, medac, Hamburg, Germany). CMV
load (CMV-DNA) was measured using the Cobas Amplicor assay
(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Prism V4.03 software
(Graphpad, San Diego, USA). Fisher’s exact test was used to
associate CMV reactivation episodes to graft-versus-host disease
(GvHD) or to CMV seroconstellation. The unpaired t-test was
used to compare the standard deviations of individual CMV
specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell frequencies over time in viremic and
non-viremic individuals. The non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test
with Dunn’s multiple comparison test was used to compare CMV
specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell levels in non-viremic patients and
patients before, during and after viremia. The correlation between
CMV specific CD4 T-cell levels at onset of viremia and peak
CMV-DNA copy number thereafter, and the correlation between
the frequencies of CMV or SEB reactive CD4 T cells expressing
IFN-c or TNF-a was calculated according to Spearman. The
effect of immunosuppressive drugs on CMV specific T-cell
reactivity was analyzed using the repeated measure ANOVA with
Bonferronis multiple comparison test. The difference between the
percentage of PD-1 expressing CMV specific CD8 T cells and pan
CD8 T cells was calculated using the paired t-test.
