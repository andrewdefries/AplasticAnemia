Abstract
Background: Intravascular hemolysis in sickle cell anemia could contribute to complications associated with nitric oxide
deficiency, advancing age, and increased mortality. We have previously reported that intense hemolysis is associated with
increased risk of vascular complications in a small cohort of adults with sickle cell disease. These observations have not been
validated in other populations.
Methods: The distribution of serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) values was used as a surrogate measure of intravascular
hemolysis in a contemporaneous patient group and an historical adult population from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell
Disease (CSSCD), all with sickle cell anemia. Chronic hyper-hemolysis was defined by the top LDH quartile and was
compared to the lowest LDH quartile.
Results: Hyper-hemolysis subjects had higher systolic blood pressure, higher prevalence of leg ulcers (OR 3.27, 95% CI 1.92-
5.53, P,0.0001), priapism (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.13-6.90, P = 0.03) and pulmonary hypertension (OR 4.32, 95% CI 2.12-8.60,
P,0.0001), while osteonecrosis (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.19-0.54, P,0.0001) and pain (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.55, P = 0.0004) were
less prevalent. Hyper-hemolysis was influenced by fetal hemoglobin and a thalassemia, and was a risk factor for early death
in the CSSCD population (Hazard Ratio = 1.97, P = 0.02).
Conclusions: Steady state LDH measurements can identify a chronic hyper-hemolysis phenotype which includes less
frequent vasooclusive pain and earlier mortality. Clinicians should consider sickle cell specific therapies for these patients, as
is done for those with more frequent acute pain. The findings also suggest that an important class of disease modifiers in
sickle cell anemia affect the rate of hemolysis.

Introduction
Hemolysis is a pathologic mechanism leading to cardiovascular,
pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and renal manifestations in diverse
human diseases [1]. Such complications have been attributed to
vascular nitric oxide (NO) depletion via direct scavenging
reactions with cell free plasma hemoglobin and impaired NO
generation due to enzymatic consumption of arginine by red cell
arginase I [1–3].
These sequelae are putative risk factors for morbidity and
mortality in aging populations with congenital hemolytic anemias
like sickle cell anemia (homozygous HBB val6). In adult sickle cell
disease, pulmonary hypertension has a high prevalence and
mortality [4,5]. A potential mechanism for its development is
pulmonary vasoconstriction and cellular proliferation in response
to decades of chronic hemolysis associated with reduced vascular
NO [1,2,4,6,7]. Priapism and leg ulcers are also associated with
markers of hemolysis leading to speculation that these, and
perhaps other disease manifestations, like stroke, could also be a
consequence of hemolysis-induced NO deficiency [4,7–9]. Prior
work from our group reported that hemolysis, as estimated by
plasma LDH level and its red cell derived isoforms, might identify
a cardiovascular sub-phenotype among adults with heterogeneous
forms of sickle cell disease [7].
While prior epidemiologic studies have focused on individual
disease manifestations, we hypothesized that the degree of
hemolysis is a key determinant influencing a phenomic spectrum
of complications that reflect the severity of sickle vasculopathy
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 5 | e2095
[10–13]. Our objective was to refine our previously reported
subphenotype [7], now limited to patients with sickle cell anemia,
and to validate the findings in a larger independent population.
Using two separate adult populations, we examined the extremes of
LDH distributions in sickle cell anemia to determine if intravascular
hemolysis represents a unifying phenotype. Our results suggest that
chronic excess, or hyper-hemolysis, is associated with a vascular
phenotype in adults that is distinguishable from sickle vasoocclusive
complications like acute painful events and osteonecrosis, and is
associated with premature mortality.
Methods
Study Populations
NIH sickle cell patients evaluated between February, 2001 and
June, 2007 were screened for pulmonary hypertension in an
NHLBI IRB approved protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT00011648) which included written informed consent
[4,6,7]. Subject recruitment continued both from local clinics
and through media advertisements [4]. Two hundred sixty three
sickle cell anemia subjects identified by sequencing the HBB locus,
with or without coincident a thalassemia, were included [14]. Data
from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD;
ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00005277) was used to inde-
pendently validate findings. This natural history study followed
more than 4000 subjects between 1978 and 1988 [15].
Hydroxyurea treatment was not available, pulmonary hyperten-
sion screening by transthoracic echocardiography was not done
routinely and measures of intravascular hemolysis and NO
physiology were not part of the original protocol. CSSCD patients
with sickle cell anemia, with or without coincident a thalassemia,
were included in the present study.
Selection of Study Patients (Figure 1)
In NIH patients, LDH values were measured during steady
state at initial evaluation with no acute crises or transfusion in the
2 weeks prior to evaluation. No subject had evidence of acute
hyper-hemolysis due to crisis, infection or hemolytic transfusion
reaction. In CSSCD subjects, we used the median LDH value
from steady state measurements taken over 6 years of observation.
Patients with ALT values .80 IU were also excluded to avoid
confounding by hepatopathy with hepatic LDH elevation. To
approximate the demographics of subjects at NIH, and to
specifically test the effect of hemolytic rate on cardiovascular
complications which evolve with increasing age, CSSCD subjects
selected were aged greater than 30 years [4,14]. This age filter
generated an older CSSCD study population that was comparable to
the NIH; one third of both study populations were comprised of
subjects aged more than 45 years (Figure S1). Because the CSSCD
recruited patients of all ages, there was an extreme bias towards
younger patients without this selection criteria (only 623 or 23%
were aged more than 30 years versus 150 or 57% at the NIH,

P,0.0001). Within each population, LDH was divided into quartiles
based on the LDH distribution; the lowest and highest quartiles
(representing values greater than the 75th
percentile or less than the
25th
percentile) were compared in subsequent analyses.
Clinical Definitions
At NIH, acute chest syndrome (ACS) was defined as a patient
reported history of one or more episodes of ‘‘chest syndrome’’ or
‘‘pneumonia’’ requiring hospitalization. Stroke was defined by
patient reported cerebrovascular disease with some documented
by MRI. Osteonecrosis was defined by a history of osteonecrosis of
the femoral head or joint replacement. Pain was quantified by
average emergency room visits per year for evaluation of severe
episodes of acute sickle cell related pain or by categorical
comparisons (no annual severe pain episodes versus any severe
episodes). In NIH subjects, pulmonary hypertension was defined
by tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) or N-terminal pro brain
naturetic peptide (NTproBNP) levels as described previously, and
severe pulmonary hypertension represented a TRV greater than
or equal to 3.0 m/s [4,6]. CSSCD definitions for ACS, stroke,
osteonecrosis, and pain are reported elsewhere, and used
confirmed clinical criteria [10,13,16,17]. NTproBNP levels were
measured in a subset of the CSSCD high and low LDH groups by
immunoassay (Elecsys Analyzer; Roche Diagnostics, Maneheim,
Germany) from stored, frozen plasma samples. Glomerular
filtration rate was calculated using the Cockroft-Gault formula
[18].
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were performed using Instat (Graph Pad Software, San
Diego, CA), Prism (Graph Pad Software), or SAS version 8.2 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). Comparison of categorical data was by Fisher
exact test (262 table with 1 degree of freedom) including odds
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Combined
analyses were stratified and are reported as Mantel-Haenszel (MH)
weighted Odds Ratios and P values derived from MH summary
chi-squares. Continuous data were log transformed where
appropriate and analyzed by paired t test, Alternate Welch’s t
test, or Mann-Whitney test. In this study, P values #0.05 were
considered significant.
Results
LDH as a Continuous Trait and Chronic Hyper-Hemolysis
in the NIH Population
LDH values were examined as a quantitative trait (Figure 2A). For
comparison, LDH values from 63 NIH subjects with sequence
verified hemoglobin SC disease or sickle b+
thalassemia (Figure 2B)
and 57 healthy African American controls (Figure 2D) demonstrate
considerable overlap with values for the NIH sickle cell anemia low
LDH group (Figure 2A) [19]. Sixty four sickle cell anemia subjects
had LDH values greater than the 75th
percentile and 62 had values
less than the 25th
percentile (Figure 2A, Table 1). Inclusion in the
highest LDH quartile defined chronic hyper-hemolysis.
Laboratory characteristics were then compared between LDH
groups (Table 1). Subjects with chronic hyper-hemolysis had
significantly higher levels of total bilirubin, AST, arginase 1
activity, plasma hemoglobin and plasma vascular cell adhesion
molecule-1. This group also had lower hemoglobin concentra-
tions, serum arginine, arginine to ornithine ratios, and fetal
hemoglobin (HbF) levels. There were no significant differences in
mean HbA levels due to recent transfusion, or in the proportion of
subjects who had received episodic red cell transfusion therapy
with greater than 5% HbA (Table 1). To determine if the
difference in HbF could be attributed to treatment with
hydroxyurea, as suggested by the difference in hydroxyurea
prescription rates between the LDH groups (Table 2, P = 0.03), all
subjects receiving hydroxyurea or with more than 5% HbA (from
transfusion) were censored from a second HbF analysis, leaving 83
eligible subjects, 21 each in the high and low LDH quartiles (Table
S1). This eliminated any suggestion of an MCV difference (Table
S2, P = 0.98), and the mean HbF was again lower in the high LDH
group (HbF 0.460.4 gm/dL) than in the low LDH group (HbF
0.860.5 gm/dL) (Table S2, P = 0.06). This smaller population
limited statistical power, but did not change the magnitude of
differences between the groups for other labs or clinical
complications (Tables S2 and S3).
Clinical Manifestations Associated with Chronic Hyper-
Hemolysis in the NIH Population
Hyper-hemolysis clinical characteristics were compared with the
low LDH group (Table 2). Chronic hyper-hemolysis subjects had
higher systolic blood pressures (P = 0.05) and lower pulse oximetry
measurements (P,0.0001). Haptoglobin was undetectable in
hyper-hemolysis patients compared to 5 subjects with measurable
levels among low LDH subjects (mean 70.6 mg/dL, n = 5, OR
0.07, 95% CI 0.04-1.26, P = 0.02, Table 2). These were 5 of only 6
detectable haptoglobin levels within the NIH population where
this was measured (n = 198), including one 65 year old female
without detectable HbA or prior treatment with hydroxyurea.
Chronic hyper-hemolysis subjects had more priapism (P = 0.04),
pulmonary hypertension (P = 0.01), severe pulmonary hyperten-
sion (P = 0.002), and elevated NTproBNP levels (P = 0.0001).
Chronic hyper-hemolysis subjects also had fewer annual emer-
gency room visits for acute painful episodes (P = 0.004). This is
consistent with a significantly lower prevalence for hydroxyurea
prescriptions (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19-0.85, P = 0.03) (Table 2).
Stability of Steady State Hemolytic Rate and Validation in
the CSSCD Population
To validate these associations, an independent analysis was
performed in the CSSCD. The distribution of median LDH values
for 451 subjects identified 113 in the top quartile and 111 in the
bottom quartile (Figure 2C). Two subjects in the bottom quartile
were excluded due to outlying low LDH values. In addition, a
single LDH determination reflected a relatively constant rate of
hemolysis in an individual at steady state, based upon analysis of
225 (49%) of the CSSCD subjects with 3 serial LDH measure-
ments (Figure 3; repeated measures of ANOVA, P = 0.66).
Subjects with the highest LDH values again had significantly
more corroborative evidence of hemolysis and lower HbF levels
(Table 1).
When the clinical characteristics of the high and low LDH
groups were compared, a phenotypic spectrum of complications
similar to those identified in the NIH population was observed
(Table 2). Among the chronic hyper-hemolysis group, there was a
significantly higher systolic blood pressure (P = 0.02), more
prevalent leg ulcers (P,0.0001), a lower prevalence of coincident
a thalassemia (genotypes aa/-a3.7
and -a3.7
/-a3.7
; P,0.0001), less
severe acute pain (P = 0.05) and a lower prevalence of osteone-
crosis (P,0.0001). There was also a male predominance in the
hyper-hemolysis group (P,0.0001). Because there were significant
differences in the sex distribution and HbF levels between LDH
comparison groups in the CSSCD (Tables 1 and 2), Odds Ratios
were adjusted for sex and/or HbF, where appropriate. Adjust-
ments changed neither the significance nor magnitude of the
associations (data not shown).

Clinical Complications in the NIH, CSSCD and Combined
Populations
Odds ratios for selected clinical complications comparing LDH
groups for the NIH, CSSCD, and combined populations are
presented in Figure 4 and Table S4. Combined results show that
leg ulcers (OR 3.27, 95% CI 1.92-5.53, P,0.0001), priapism (OR
2.62, 95% CI 1.13-6.90, P = 0.03) and pulmonary hypertension
defined by NTproBNP (OR 4.32, 95% CI 2.12-8.60, P,0.0001)
were significantly more prevalent with chronic hyper-hemolysis,
while osteonecrosis (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.19-0.54, P,0.0001) and
severe pain episodes (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.55, P = 0.0004)
were less prevalent (Figure 4C). There was no significant difference
in acute chest syndrome (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.49-1.41, P = 0.54) or
stroke (OR 1.95, 95% CI 0.85-4.72, P = 0.13). Hyper-hemolysis
was also associated with a significantly lower prevalence of a
thalassemia (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.58, P,0.0001).
Survival with Chronic Hyper-Hemolysis
High LDH values were associated with higher mortality in the
entire NIH cohort [7]. We therefore examined the extremes of
hemolytic rate from the CSSCD population for effects of LDH
distributions on mortality. Chronic hyper-hemolysis was associated
with earlier mortality in the CSSCD population (Figure 5, Hazard
ratio 1.97, 95% CI 1.14-3.41, log-rank test P = 0.02), where the
mean follow-up was 10.2 years.
Discussion
Identification of genetic variants underlying human disease has
become a priority [20]. A major limitation for genetic studies is
that phenotypes defined by a medical diagnosis are often
imprecise. This recognition led to a proposed Human Phenome
Project, where phenomics would examine both inter-individual
variability in newly recognized phenotypes and correlations
between different subphenotypes within a single disease [21].
We propose that chronic intravascular hyper-hemolysis represents
a novel sickle cell anemia subphenotype. Its identification might be
helpful for locating disease modifying factors and developing new
therapeutic strategies.
Sickle cell anemia is a prototypical hemolytic disorder.
Nevertheless, the degree of hemolysis varies among patients and

its intensity is modulated by HbF expression and co-incident a
thalassemia. It is also likely to be influenced by other genes
important in sickle cell pathophysiology. Based on an analysis of
steady state LDH distributions in nearly 700 adults with sickle cell
anemia, chronic hyper-hemolysis represents a phenotype in
independent populations who were recruited originally for
different purposes during different therapeutic eras. Individuals
with hyper-hemolysis had less frequent vasoocclusive pain and
osteonecrosis, increased prevalence of leg ulcers and priapism,
higher systolic blood pressure and more pulmonary hypertension.
Earlier mortality also characterized hyper-hemolysis. Unexpect-
edly, hyperhemolysis did not result in significantly more
reticulocytosis in either population, as was also observed in our
prior analysis of pulmonary hypertension in sickle cell anemia
[14]. Reticulocytosis is a physiologic response to overall levels of
hemolysis, including both extravascular and intravascular red cell
destruction. Thus, we speculate that the similar reticulocytes levels
might be explained by our inability to quantify differences in the
degree of ineffective erythropoiesis, levels of extravascular
hemolysis, or their collective effects on reticulocytosis between
LDH groups. As expected, the hyper-hemolysis phenotype was
also associated with lower HbF levels and a lower prevalence of a
thalassemia. These findings provide additional insight into some of
the factors that affect severity and overall survival, and could
impact indications for treatment.
Alpha thalassemia is a known genetic determinant that lessens
anemia and hemolysis (Table 2) [22,23]. It is associated with less
priapism [8], fewer leg ulcers [11,24], and more osteonecrosis
[16,24,25], while there have been conflicting results with respect to
vasoocclusive pain [10,13,24,26]. Protective associations with
priapism and leg ulcers are consistent with effects on bioavailable
NO [1,2]. Alpha thalassemia was significantly less prevalent
among those with hyper-hemolysis further implicating effects on
NO as a potential mechanism underlying these associations.
Similarly, high levels of HbF are associated with less frequent pain,
acute chest syndrome, leg ulcers, and reduced mortality [9–13].
This is consistent with HbF’s ability to inhibit HbS polymeriza-
tion, thereby decreasing either vasoocclusion or hemolysis [27].
Surprisingly, associations have not been observed between HbF
and priapism or pulmonary hypertension [4,8]. In this study,
higher HbF and fewer vascular complications were found in the
low LDH groups. Perhaps HbF has a sufficiently small protective

effect against individual complications such that an association is
only detectable through secondary analysis of closely related traits
like hemolysis. Identifying such effects is further complicated by
the variable distribution of HbF among F-cells which was not
assayed in either study population. Putative loci controlling
cellular HbF distribution have been localized to chromosomes
2p, 6q, 8q and Xp22, and in particular, the absence of X
inactivation at Xp22 results in higher F-cells in females [28–31].
Additional studies of X-linked genes for HbF or glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase might explain the male predominance
in the CSSCD chronic hyper-hemolysis group.
Previous studies have suggested the possibility of a chronic
hyper-hemolysis phenotype [13,32–36]. Comparison of sickle cell
anemia in Greece and Jamaica suggested that leg ulcers and
anemia were much more common in Jamaica [35]. Ballas
proposed that similar observations could represent different sickle
cell phenotypes, one defined by leg ulcers, and the other by
frequent pain. Infrequent pain was also associated with decreased
red cell deformability and more dense erythrocytes [33]. Finally,
Bayesian modeling was used to dichotomize the Jamaican cohort
study into either pain crisis or leg ulcer phenotypes, where leg
ulcers were associated with anemia [32]. In fact, the paradoxical
relationship between prominent anemia and fewer pain crises is a
consistent finding in multiple studies in agreement with our
conclusion that chronic hyper-hemolysis may be characterized by
fewer pain crises [13,34,36].
Several limitations are inherent to our studies. First, the
CSSCD, whose patients were enrolled more than 25 years ago,
had only a limited number of older adults. Additional retrospective
analysis of infrequent adult complications like stroke is limited by
this demographic, although the combined analysis could suggest a
trend towards an association between stroke and hemolysis when
interpreted in the context of other works [19,37,38]. A high
proportion of CSSCD subjects were excluded due to an elevated
ALT (Figure 1), suggesting that subclinical liver disease (e.g., viral
hepatitis) was more common than it is presently with universal
hepatitis B vaccination and screening of blood for hepatitis C [39].
Also, hydroxyurea therapy was not available, while its potential
beneficial effects might be evident in the low LDH group at NIH.
Early mortality with hyper-hemolysis was evident with long term
follow-up in the larger CCSCD population, and presumably this
was due to previously unrecognized pulmonary hypertension as
suggested by the higher prevalence of elevated NTproBNP levels.
The survival difference was only apparent after 6 years, suggesting

that longer follow-up at NIH will be necessary to confirm this
finding [7]. We have also shown that markers of hemolysis are a
disease component forecasting earlier death using network
modeling [40].
Chronic hyper-hemolysis can identify individuals at risk for
premature mortality who may be treated with hydroxyurea less
often than patients with frequent pain, its major clinical indication.
Despite prior findings that hydroxyurea has no beneficial effect on
pulmonary hypertension, its use has been advocated on the basis of
improved erythrocyte survival and experiential treatment in
hemoglobinopathy clinics [4,5,41]. Thus, prospective long term
clinical trials evaluating the effects of hydroxyurea, transfusion
therapy and other innovative treatment modalities focused on
preserving NO bioavailability and decreasing hemolysis, cell free
hemoglobin and vascular complications are warranted [41–43].
These data support an emerging model for understanding the
protean manifestations of sickle cell anemia that could be
influenced by either hemolysis-driven vasculopathy or blood
viscosity/vasoocclusion [44]. Future genetic studies of this unifying
phenotype might provide novel mechanistic insights into patho-
genesis and treatment. Clinically, this study further supports the
use of steady state LDH measurements to identify sickle cell
anemia patients who are at increased risk for earlier mortality and
who might otherwise have treatment options overlooked because
of infrequent vasoocclusive pain.
