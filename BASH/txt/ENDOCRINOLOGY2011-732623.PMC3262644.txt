A 52-year-old Japanese woman was examined because of general malaise, weight loss and a lump in her left breast. She was
diagnosed with cancer of the left breast and Graves’ disease, and was administered methimazole (MMI). A left mastectomy was
performed for the breast cancer. She presented with a high fever and peripheral blood examination revealed a severe pancytopenia.
She was diagnosed with severe aplastic anemia, and administered G-CSF, however, the treatment was unsuccessful. Thus, oral
methyprednisolone and cyclosporin were added. There was a remarkable improvement in the peripheral blood count.
1. Introduction
Methimazole (MMI) is widely used to treat Graves’ disease.
Agranulocytosis is a severe side eﬀect and its frequency is
reported to be 0.18–0.55% [1–5]. Aplastic anemia (AA) is
very rare in MMI treatment and most cases rapidly recover
after cessation of MMI therapy [6–13]. Granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor (G-CSF), glucocorticoid and cyclosporin
have only been used in severe cases. I report here a case
of MMI-induced severe AA associated with severe bacterial
infection. The patient was treated with G-CSF after cessation
of MMI, but her peripheral blood count did not recover
even when she was administered a higher dosage of G-
CSF for 11 days. Therefore, we administered a combination
of methyprednisolone and cyclosporin and, her peripheral
blood count and bone marrow rapidly recovered.
2. Case Report
A 52-year-old Japanese woman was examined in March, 2003
because of general malaise, weight loss and a lump in her
left breast. She was diagnosed with cancer of the left breast
and Graves’ disease, and was administered MMI 30 mg/day
for Graves’ disease. Her thyroid function was controlled with
MMI, and a left mastectomy was performed for breast cancer
one month later. She presented with a sudden fever of 39◦
C
and a sore throat 12 days after the operation. The periph-
eral blood examination revealed a white blood-cell count
of 0.8×109/L, with 12% neutrophils, 3% monocytes, 2%
eosinophils, 83% lymphocytes, hemoglobin concentration
of 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 4×109/L; therefore, MMI
therapy was stopped and she was administered 50 μg of G-
CSF subcutaneous injection and 2.5 g of gamma globulin
intravenous infusion. The treatment was unsuccessful, and
she was transferred to our hospital because of progressive
pancytopenia and a constant high fever for a week. On
admission, she complained of a sore throat, chills and general
malaise. A physical examination revealed a high fever (39◦
C),
sinus tachycardia, grade II systolic murmur, exophthalmos,
moderate diﬀuse goiter and gingival bleeding. The palpebral
conjunctiva was anemic. No superﬁcial lymph nodes were
swollen. A Penrose drain was left in her left breast, and
exudates were noted. Oropharyngeal examination revealed
tonsillitis without white curd-like plaque. Electrocardiogram
showed sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray was normal. Periph-
eral blood examination showed a white blood-cell count of
0.8×109/L, with 2% neutrophils, hemoglobin concentration
of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 3×109/L, and reticulation of red
2 ISRN Endocrinology
blood cells of 1.3%. Laboratory examinations showed nor-
mal liver function and renal function. Serum albumin was
3.0 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase was 260 IU/L, total cholesterol
was 92 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) was 16.9 mg/dL.
Throat and blood bacterial cultures were negative, but
exudate culture from her left breast yielded Staphylococcus
species. Thyroid function tests were TSH <0.002 mIU/L,
free triiodothyronine (FT3) >20.0 pg/mL, free thyroxine
(FT4) >8.0 ng/dL, and TSH receptor antibody 19.7 IU/L;
thus MMI-induced severe AA was strongly suspected, and
bone marrow (BM) aspiration was performed immediately.
There were decreased nucleated cells with fat replacement
in BM (Figure 1(a)). The patient was administered iodide
126 mg/day and imipenem/cilastatin 2 g/day and G-CSF
was increased to 300 μg/day. Two days later, intravenous
amikacin (400 mg/day) was added; however, with a progres-
sive depression in peripheral blood count, the patient needed
transfusions of erythrocytes and platelets. Five days later,
oral methyprednisolone and cyclosporin were added. There
was a remarkable improvement of the high fever and pancy-
topenia, and normalization of the CRP. G-CSF was stopped
8 days later, and methyprednisolone and cyclosporin were
stopped 10 days later. A second bone marrow aspiration was
performed 3 weeks later and BM was already normocellular
(Figure 1(b)); thus she was administered 131I radioniodine,
and 2 months later her thyroid function was normal. The
clinical course of this case is illustrated in Figure 2.
3. Discussion
AA is very rare complication as a result of the admin-
istration of MMI [6–13]. The pathogenic mechanisms of
agranulocytosis and AA as a result of the administration of
MMI are unclear; however, direct cytotoxic eﬀect by MMI
or autoimmune reaction for bone marrow precursors are
candidates of pathogenic mechanisms. Previously, it was
reported that agranulocytosis was developed in patients
administered more than 40 mg/day MMI; however, agran-
ulocytosis developed regardless of the dosage and duration
of MMI administration [1, 2]. Tamai et al. found that
HLA DRB1∗08032 related to MMI induced agranulocytosis
in Japanese [14]; however, our patient did not have it.
Weitzman and Stossel reported expression of antineutrophil
antibody belonging to IgM in the sera of patients who
developed MMI induced agranulocytosis [15]. It is reported
that incubation with autologous sera of a patient with
MMI induced AA collected on earlier days resulted in
a reduced number of colony-forming units in culture
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and autoimmune
humoral reactions may occur against myeloid precursors
[7]. In addition, MMI induces other autoimmune disorders
such as hemolytic anemia, insulin autoimmune syndrome
and lupus-like syndrome [16–18]. Thus, the intervention
of autoimmune abnormality may be more causal than the
cytotoxic eﬀect.
Most cases of MMI induced AA usually develop within 3
months after the start of therapy [6]. In our patient, bone
marrow aplasia occurred about 1.5 months after the start

of MMI. Moreover, recovery is usually prompt within 2–
5 weeks from the withdrawal of MMI and the start of G-
CSF, and bone marrow transplantation and antithymocyte
globulin are seldom needed [6]. However, the withdrawal of
MMI and the administration of G-CSF for 11 days had little
eﬀect on the peripheral blood count in the patient. Therefore,
oral methylprednisolone and cyclosporin were added, the
neutrophils count rapidly increased and the erythrocyte
and platelet counts gradually increased. Escobar-Morreale et
al. reported that in the case of MMI induced AA patient
who had no response with granulocyte-monocyte colony-
stimulating factor for a week, standard immunosuppressive
drugs should be susbstituted [8]. As the course of MMI
induced AA is highly variable, it is not known whether bone

marrow aplasia recovered spontaneously or whether recovery
was a result of the administration of G-CSF or methylpred-
nisolone and cyclosporin. It was reported that the recovery
of MMI induced agranulocytosis was shortened signiﬁcantly
by the administration of G-CSF and glucocorticoid [19].
However, the administration of G-CSF for 11 days had little
eﬀect on the peripheral blood count in our patient. It could
not be determined which drug was most eﬀective, but these
combinations seemed useful in our patient.
As the patient developed AA with breast cancer two
weeks postoperatively, the Penrose drain was left in her left
breast, and exudates were noted. Staphylococcus species was
detected from the culture of exudates. Immunosuppressive
agents such as glucocorticoid and cyclosporin generally
aggravate an infectious disease, resulting in restorative delay.
For example, our patient suﬀered from severe bacterial
infection; however, bone marrow rapidly recovered after
the immunosuppressive agent combination was adminis-
tered and the severe infection was resolved immediately
after administration of antibiotics. This suggests that bone
marrow is rapidly recovered by a combination of G-CSF
and an immunosuppressive agent under the appropriate
administration of antibiotics in a severe AA patient with
severe infection.
In summary, I report the successful treatment of MMI-
induced severe AA by G-CSF, methyprednisolone, and
cyclosporin. Although AA is a very rare but severe com-
plication of Basedow’s disease with MMI treatment, early
recovery can be expected as a result of the administration of
a combination of G-CSF and immunosuppressive therapy.
