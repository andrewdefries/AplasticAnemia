The object of the present communication is to present the func-
tional changes produced by repeated transfusions in the blood-making
and blood-destroying apparatus and in metabolism, and also the
structural changes in the viscera of dogs and rabbits. The source
of an anemia that developed during the plethoric stage has also been
considered. In an attempt to throw further light on the relation of
the spleen to blood formation and blood destruction, we first studied
the effect of splenectomy in artificial plethora, and tried to find evi-
dence of increased enzyme action in the spleen removed at a time
when blood was being destroyed in greatly increased quantities.
Not only were these efforts barren of results, but it was also found
that our knowledge of the changes caused by the artificial induction
of plethora was in itself meager.

Blood Formation and Destruction.
A fewwriters have studied the effectof plethora on rabbits, animals notoriously
inconstant in their bemopoietic reactions. Hess (1) induced plethora in rabbits
by repeated transfusions in order to study the effect on the work of the heart,
and Itami (2) studied the tissue changes in these same animals. These writers
also described an extremely plethoric rabbit, which, in spite of continued trans-
fusions and of the absence of isolysins, developed a marked anemia. Robertson
(3) has described more thoroughly this type of plethoric anemia and has shown

the relationship of plethora and anemia to bone marrowactivity, as indicated
by the percentage of reticulatedred cells. This writer found that agglutinins
developedcoincidentallywith the anemia, but did not give quantitative details of
the results. Kambe and Komiya (4) also encountered this anemia in rabbits
that had been made plethoric and also demonstrated the presenceof agglutinins
qualitativdy.
Ottenberg and Thalhimer (5) found that isohemolysinsare seldompresent in
the blood of normal cats, but that they often appear in the blood of recipient
cats after transfusions. With the development of hemolysins, the animals
developed a marked anemia, from which they quickly recovered after cessation
of transfusions. Ottenberg,Kaliski,and Friedman (6) demonstrated the presence
of isoagglutininsand isohemolysinsin dogs. These authors also showed that
direct transfusionof blood that is agglutinated and laked by the recipient's blood
is followedby the destruction of the transfusedbloodwith an intenseintoxication.
Boycott and Douglas (7, 8) observed that dogs do not destroy cells during the
days immediately following a first transfusion, but that once the animal has
become accustomed to destroying blood, it can dispose of the transfused red
bloodcellstwo to eight timesas fast as after the first transfusion. They therefore
think that somemechanismmust be developedby the animalfor the rapid destruc-
tion of foreign red cells. SinceBoycott and Douglas could find no evidenceof
isohemolysins after the transfusions, they concluded that transfused red ceils
werenot destroyed by direct hemolysis.
Methods.
Plethora was produced in dogs by daily transfusions of 25 to
200 cc. of whole blood taken from six compatible donors in rotation.
Dogs weighing from 6 to 10 kilos were used as recipients and larger
animals as donors. With careful technique the jugular veins were
used during the entire experiment for aspiration of blood from the
donor and injection into the recipient. The donor's blood was drawn
into an Erlenmeyer flask containing 2 cc. of 10 per cent sodium citrate
for every 100 cc. of blood, to prevent clotting. The blood was allowed
to flow into the recipient from a sterile burette by gravity. The
hemoglobin and the total blood volume figures were used for estimat-
ing the degree of plethora.
Hemoglobin was determined by the Newcomer (9) method, and
the vital red method of Keith, Rowntree, and Geraghty (10) was
used in the estimation of the blood volume. The method of Wilbur
and Addis (11) was employed for the determination of urobilin as an
index of blood destruction.
EDWARD B. KRUMBHAAR AND ALFRED CHANUTIN 849
Bone marrow activity was studied by estimating the percentage
of reticulated or "skeined" erythrocytes. It is suggested that for
the sake of brevity, the word "reticulocyte" be substituted for "re-
ticulated er:ythrocyte," and the term "reticulosis" be designated
to replace some such expression as "an increase in the number of
reticulated cells," as is now the custom. The percentage of reticu,
locytes was estimated after vital staining with Grfibler's brilliant
cresyl blue.1 The recipients were fed a standard diet of beef heart,
cracker meal, sugar, lard, bone ash, and salt, and the donors were
given table scraps. The test animals gained in weight during the
experiment, while the donors became only slightly anemic with only
a small rise in the percentage of reticulocytes. Removal of the
spleen was performed under ether anesthesia without noteworthy
loss of blood.
RESULTS.
Production of Plethora.
Seven dogs were rendered plethoric by the method described.
The degree of plethora obtained did not depend on the amount of
blood injected; for instance, one dog given twenty transfusions,
averaging 48 cc., attained as great a rise in hemoglobin as another
injected twenty-three times, each transfusion averaging 157 co.
The largest number of transfusions in one animal was 61 in 76 days;
the shortest period was 15 days with eleven transfusions in a fatal
case. The maximum hemoglobin obtained in these plethoric animals
varied from 146 to 226 per cent (Text-figs. 1 to 4).
A peculiar result was noted in three out of four dogs (Nos. 1, 2, and
3) when transfusions were discontinued during the height of plethora;
namely, a temporary rise in hemoglobin of 11, 17, and 21 per cent, oc-
curring on the 3 following days. This was also noted by Boycott and
Douglas in one of their rabbits. The drop in hemoglobin after the
sudden rise was almost as striking. The fourth dog (No. 4) main-
tained a constant hemoglobin level for 10 days before the transfusions
were stopped, and upon ceasing injections, there was a sudden drop.
It is suggested that possibly some organ, such as the liver, acts as a
blood storehouse, and upon cessation of transfusion, a further rise in
1American preparations of this stain have not been of any use in our hands.
850 EXPEP-IMENTAL PLETHORA
blood count is caused by excess blood being thrown into the blood
stream.
The results of our investigations have shown that the excess blood
is destroyed as rapidly by the splenectomized as by the normal dogs,
after ceasing the transfusions. Three dogs were made plethoric,
their spleens removed, and transfusions stopped; the fourth dog used
for a control was made plethoric but was not splenectomized. In all
four cases, after discontinuing transfusions, the blood was destroyed
with approximately equal rapidity, as indicated by hemoglobin and
blood volume studies. After 4 to 6 weeks the hemoglobin had re-
turned to normal and then a moderate anemia (hemoglobin varying
from 15 to 27 per cent below normal) persisted for a few weeks, .fol-
lowed by a permanent return to normal. This anemia might be
considered as an expression either of the time required by the bone
marrow to recover from its enforced inactivity, or more probably of
the organism's attempt to rid itself of its newly acquired powers
of increased blood destruction.
The first few transfusions raise the hemoglobin percentage only
very slightly. The reactions of animals during this time differ widely.
Dog 3, for example, was transfused with 520 cc. of blood in 4 days,
causing the hemoglobin to rise from the normal of 86 per cent to only
98 per cent. Another dog's (No. 2) hemoglobin increased only 9
per cent by the 3rd day after 95 cc. of blood had been transfused.
The organism can apparently handle this excess blood during the first
few days of transfusions without showing any signs of marked in-
creased blood destruction, as will be shown below in the urobilin and
metabolism studies.
One apparently successful attempt was made to break down an
animal's blood-destroyingmechanism (No. 5) by transfusing relatively
massive quantities of blood (averaging t33 cc. per day). It was
possible, by this means, to obtain a rise in hemoglobin from 98 per
cent to 200 per cent in 11 days. With the continuance of these large
daily transfusions, however, this very high blood concentration was
after 8 days reduced by the organism to 150 per cent. Continued
transfusions then apparently killed the animal after a second rise in
hemoglobin to 226 per cent. The red cell count, at this time, was
15,500,000, as compared with the normal of 7,150,000. The cause
of death of this animal will be considered later.
EDWARD B. KI~UMBHAAR AND ALFRED CHANUTIN 8,51
Anemia Following Plethora.
This anemia, developing in spite of and probably on account of
continued transfusions, is characterized by a marked fall in hemoglobin
and red blood cells with at first little reticulocyte evidence of regen-
eration. In one splenectomized dog (No. 6, Text-fig. 1), the anemia
developed rapidly until, at the end of 15 days, the hemoglobin had
fallen from 138 per cent to 21 per cent; there was then a temporary
rise for several days, followed by a fall to 13 per cent, when it reached
the point of greatest severity. Although transfusions were contin-
ued daily at this time, the hemoglobin at the end of 13 days was 17
per cent, The injections were stopped and the hemoglobin returned
to normal slowly. In another animal (No. 7, Text-fig. 3), in which
transfusions were continued after splenectomy, the hemoglobin fell
from 185 per cent to 67 per cent during a period of 18 days; with
continued transfusions, however, the hemoglobin rose again to a
high figure.
The experiment with Dog 6 was controlled by transfusing equal
amounts of blood from the same donors into a normal dog (No. 4).
This animal developed an artificial plethora (which persisted until
transfusions were discontinued) without anemia (Text-fig. 2). The
significance of this disparity will be discussed later.
Bone Marrow Activity in Plethora and Anemia.
Our experiments with dogs have confirmed Robertson's (3) find-
ings in rabbits that reticulocytes practically vanished during the
stage of artificial plethora, but were greatly increased during the
"plethoric anemia" stage (Text-figs. 1 to 4). The value of reticu-
locytes as an index of bone marrow activity and blood formation is
especially evident in Text-fig. 1, which shows the sudden anemia
following plethora in Dog 6. The sudden fall in hemoglobin is seen
to be accompanied by a slight increase in reticulocytes, which had
been practically absent in the plethoric stage. This reticulosis
became marked after the anemia had been in progress 2 weeks, and
after transfusions had been stopped, the reticulocytes increased to
the extremely high level of 81 per cent. The animal's hemoglobin
and reticulocytes gradually returned to normal after transfusions

after splenectomy, the slight increase in reticulocytes should be noted
in passing.
Blood Volume Studies.
The vital red method of Keith, Rowntree, and Geraghty gives, according to
Smith, Arnold, and Whipple (12), an accurate indexofplasma volume, but is less
reliable for red cell volume determinations. One can, however, obtain compar-
able results when working on the same animal for a longperiod of time. Keith,
Rowntree, and Geraghty (10) observed in many anemic patients an increase of
plasma volume and found that in polycythemia the plasma volume may be either
low or high--in the latter case true plethora may be said to exist. Bock (13), on
the other hand, studying the blood volume in pernicious anemia, has shown that
as longas the hemoglobin remains above 30 per cent, there is a remarkable con-
stancy of plasma volume. In patients with lower hemoglobin, there is a corre-
sponding reduction of the plasma volume. The variations in blood volume are,
for the most part, due to changes in red cellcontent. Denny (14) also finds that
the plasma volume is essentially normal in pernicious anemia, and a decrease in
total volume is due to loss of cell mass. The constancy of the plasma volume
is also shown by Peters and Rubnitz's (15) report that the plasma nitrogen has
no tendency to decrease in anemia.
In four dogs studied, the total blood volume was, as might be ex-
pected, greatly increased above normal in the plethoric stage and
decreased below normal in the anemic stage (Tables I to IV). With
the exception of one animal (No. 5), which died from the induced
plethora, the plasma volume showed surprisingly few changes, either
in anemia or plethora. The changes in red cell volume were chiefly
responsible for the variations in total blood volume, so that the ple-
thora might properly be termed "acythemic plethora."
It is interesting to note, in agreement with Bock's and Denny's
findings, that in the extreme anemia obtained in Dog 6, the total
red cell volume was estimated, once at 55 cc. and 5 days later at
37 cc., while the plasma volume remained practically normal. The
total blood volume dropped from a normal of 980 cc. to a minimum
of 512 cc. The anemia in Dog 7 was manifested by a change from
the normal blood volume of 1,000 cc. to 794 cc. The plasma volume
in this dog during the anemic period was identical with the normal,
with a diminished red cell volume.
EDWARD B. KRUMBHAAR AND ALFRED CHANUTIN 855
With extreme plethora (No. 5) there was a marked diminution in
plasma volume, together with an increased red cell volume. This
diminution of plasma volume is present to a slight extent in all cases
of extreme plethora during the early stages of transfusions. There
is then manifested a tendency for the plasma volume to return to
the original level.
Urobilin Excretion.
The amount of urobilinogen and urobilin in the urine and stools
is now generally recognized to be a fairly accurate index of the degree
of blood destruction in the body (Wilbur and Addis (11) and Rob-
ertson (16)). As the experimental animals were on a constant diet
throughout the experiments, Whipple's (17) demonstration that
bile pigment elimination can be greatly changed by modification
of diet does not apply to these experiments.
Urobilin was found to be present in the urine in small amounts only
during periods of marked blood destruction. Urobilin determinations
were made on the feces of three dogs (Nos. 4, 6, and 7), the first two of
these having received equal amounts of blood from the same donors.
Dog 4 reached a maximum urobilin excretion of 8,000 units at the
same time that the plethora reached its maximum. At this point
transfusions were stopped, and both blood count and urobilin ex-
cretion returned gradually to normal. Dog 6 showed a maximum
output of 14,400 units at the height of the "plethoric anemia." This
high urobilin output continued for about 4 weeks. When transfusions
ended, and the dog's hemoglobin began to rise, accompanied by a
simultaneous reticulosis, the urobilin excretion was greatly diminished.
Dog 7 also showed a greatly increased urobilin elimination but press
of work did not permit many determinations at this time. (Tables
I to III.)
Blood Counts.
Hemoglobin and erythrocyte determinations have already been
considered. Leucocytes, estimated during the course of the experi-
ments, were considerably increased, chiefly due to an increase of
polymorphonuclear leucocytes; but changes were so inconstant and
unexplainable that they will not be further considered. Fragility

tests made on several animals during the course of the experiments
showed an increase in both the maximum and minimum resistance,
both during the plethoric and anemic stages, but these were not

Metabolism Studies.
Although early in our work we devoted our attention solely to
urobilln excretion, it later seemed advisable to study the influence of
the artificial plethora and its consequent anemia on the nitrogenous
metabolism, in the presence of daily parenteral introduction of large
amounts of isoprotein.
The dogs used for each experiment were placed in metabolism
cages, on a constant diet of raw beef heart, cracker meal, sugar,
lard, bone ash, and sodium chloride, that had a known, sufficient
caloric value. Water was given ad libitum. After 1 or 2 weeks on
this special diet, if the weight of the animal remained constant,
a preliminary metabolism study was made; Dogs 4 and 6 were
first studied metabolically after the transfusion experiments were
well ill progress. The constant diet was continued between periods
of metabolism study, so that although the introduced nitrogen was
not actually determined, changes in elimination can reasonably be
attributed to the transfused blood. Each dog was catheterized at
the end of 24 hours, with the exception of one male (No. 6) chosen
before the metabolic studies were contemplated. Although this
renders the 24 hour periods less precise than those of the females,
the length of the series studied prevents gross error in this particular
experiment, if averages of several days are considered. None of the
animals showed loss of weight or other ill effects during the period
of metabolic study, except one (No. 5) which on account of anorexia
and diarrhea could not be included in this study.
In the analysis of the urine, the total nitrogen was determined by
the Kjeldahl-Gunning method, urea by Folin's aeration method,
ammonia by the procedure of Van Slyke and CuUen, creatinine and
creatine by Folin's method, uric acid by the Hotchkiss-Benedict
modification, and total phosphates by the uranium acetate method.
Forster (18,19) demonstratedmanyyears ago that wholedogbloodtransfused
into a dog in moderateamounts had a marked stability, sincehe failed to obtain
an appreciableHse in the nitrogen output. On the other hand, foreignserum

(20), confirmingthe experimentsof Forster, found that dog blood introducedby

mouth is completely metabolized in contrast to an equal amount of "living"
dog blood, which may be given intravenouslywith little or no increase in nitrogen
excretion. From these experiments, we must conclude that transfused blood
protein is not immediately destroyed and that its protein is utilized when given
as a food.
The nitrogenous metabolism of Dog 7 is presented (Table V) as an
example of the changes that occur before and during the plethoric
and anemic stages. Although the nitrogen intake in food and blood
transfusions was not determined, the results of nitrogen output are

so striking that certain conclusions can, nevertheless, be drawn. In
Dog 7 during the first 10 days of the experiments, 1,200 cc. of blood
were transfused, representing roughly 36 gm. of nitrogen. The ni-
trogen output in urine and feces for this period was practically nor-
mal, indicating that the nitrogen in excess of that accounted for by
the plethoric vascular system was being stored by the body. With
continued transfusions, the nitrogen output rose, but never com-
mensurately with the amount injected. With the onset of anemia,
the nitrogen excretion rose to its highest point; but during the course
of the anemia, there was no such marked nitrogenous excretion.
EDWARD B. I~DMBI~ AND ALFRED CHANUTIN 861
Dog 4 was first studied metabolically while the hemoglobin was
returning to normal after transfusions had been stopped. The first
period, during plethora, showed a high nitrogen output; when a
decrease in blood volume had occurred, the nitrogen excretion was
practically normal as judged by the food intake.
In Dog 6 metabolism studies were first done while transfusions
were being made, during the period of anemia. A relatively high
nitrogen output was found, which decreased to about normal soon
after the transfusions were stopped. During the period of recovery,
there was a much lower excretion of nitrogen, which appears to be
lower than normal. It is problematic at what stage the excess ni-
trogen of transfused blood is excreted, since there is apparently no
indication from these analyses that excess, or even equal amounts of
nitrogen are excreted at any time except previous to sudden develop-
ment of anemia. Albumin was occasionally present in the urine
during extreme plethora and at the beginning of anemia, but never
in quantities that would account for the nitrogen introduced.
The creatinine, creatine, and phosphate studies give no noteworthy
information about the processes concerned in blood destruction.
The urea excretions paralleled the total nitrogen, but the ammonia
excretion was apparently not affected. The feces nitrogen was rela-
tively constant. It was thought that the cell destruction would be
so great that a study of uric acid metabolism might be of interest,
even though allantoin determinations were not made. The result,
however, showed no constant or marked changes.
In the urine of all animals made extremely plethoric, bile and
albumin could be detected in appreciable amounts. This was also
noted during the period of anemia.
m,
PostmortemFindings.
By far the most striking change in the organs of our plethoric animals
is the tremendous deposition of hemosiderin in the spleen, liver,
lymph nodes, and bone marrow. Its almost complete absence from
other organs is strong evidence of the important part that these or-
gans play in the storage and elimination of the products of increased
862 EXPERIMENTAL PLETIIOKA
blood destruction. Its absence from the kidney accords with the
absence of hematuria or hemoglobinuria, though differing from various
experimental and clinical conditions in which pigment deposition
has been marked in this organ.
In animals killed or dying while transfusions were being continued,
there is also, as would be expected, extreme congestion of blood
vessels throughout the body. This is so marked in the viscera that
details of structure often are obscured, so that it is usually impossible,
for instance, to determine whether given groups of cells are packed
into phagocytes or into small vessels. It is safe to say, however,
that pigment phagocytosis either entirely replaces or at least is far
greater than erythrocyte phagocytosis in the several organs of the
hemopoietic system. The engulfing of whole erythrocytes by the
phagocytes of the hemopoietic system probably only occurs in acute
cases of greatly increased blood destruction and then only for a short
time. In the extreme type of blood destruction that follows the
administration of hemolytic serum, for instance, Pearce and Austin
(21) only found erythrocytes within the phagocytes for a few days
in dogs, and Karsner, Amiral, and Bock (22) found in splenectomized
cats that this phase was practically complete after 48 hours. Voegt-
lin, Hooper, and Johnson (23) have also observed it in acute T. N. T.
poisoning of dogs, but here marked fragmentation of the circulating
erythrocytes and in the perfusates of spleen, liver, and bone marrow
was also found.
In the spleen and lymph nodes of our animals, minute granules of
hemosiderin are here and there found in large numbers free in the
pulp and sinuses, and even within the blood vessels. These observa-
tions tend indirectly to support Rous and Robertson's (24) view that
erythrocytes are chiefly destroyed by fragmentation into hemoglobin-
containing dust, which is then removed from the circulation by the
phagocytes of several organs.
The sinuses of the spleen and lymph nodes are chiefly filled by
myriads of endothelial phagocytes containing hemosiderin granules
of varying size. They are also numerous in the splenic pulp and
even scattered through the lymphoid tissue of the lymph nodes.
In smaller amount hemosiderin-bearlng phagocytes persist in animals
that have not been transfused for many weeks whose blood picture
EDWARD B. KRUMBHAAI{ AND ALFP~ED CHANUTIN 853
has returned to normal. Hemosiderin also is found extracellularly
in large clumps, apparently from fusion of pigment from phagocytes.
In the liver, hemosiderin-containing cells are also prominent; from
their position between the strands of liver cells many are apparently
Kupffer cells, but others occurring in Glisson's capsule and in the por-
tal vessels are obviously the usual endothelial phagocyte. Thrombosis
of bile ducts and proliferation of bile capillaries and fibrous tissue
are also found. The strands of liver cells are so compressed by thecon-
gested capillaries that in many places they remain atrophied after
normal conditions have been restored. A similar condition is found
in some lymph nodes, where the greatly distended sinuses practically
fill the node so that there is very little lymphoid tissue remaining.
Grossly, lymph nodes appear enlarged, reddened or reddish brown,
with a purplish center. Histologically, many of these changes are
seen to be due to great congestion of the blood vessels with accumu-
lation of the above mentioned phagocytes. In other instances, how-
ever, erythrocytes are found, sometimes in great quantities both in
the central and peripheral sinuses, mingled with the usual content of
endothelial, lymphoid, and plasma cells. No evidences of hemor-
rhage are to be found, so that the appearance of a hemolymphnode
is strongly suggested. In the absence of special injections, this
point cannot be definitely settled, but the impression remains strong
that under the need for greatly increased blood destruction, structures
resembling hemolymph nodes are developed.
The bone marrow exhibits not only the same pigment deposition,
but also considerable cell hyperplasia. This was not found by Itami
in plethoric animals and certainly the blood picture during life points
to lessened erythropoiesis. In Boycott and Douglas~animals, on the
other hand, Prlce-Jones found a definite cellular increase, though not
necessarily of cells concerned in blood formation. If this increase
were only of the leucocytic series it might be correlated with the leu-
cocytosis constantly found; but erythroblasts and unidentified cells
were also increased in number. The only observations we can offer
in explanation are the lack of specificity of bone marrow response,
to which attention has been called elsewhere, and the impossibility of
determining in a cellular bone marrow just which cells are concerned
with blood cell formation and which with blood destruction. Cer-
864 EXPERIMENTAL PLETIIOP,A
tainly the accumulation of hemosiderin, both intra- and extracellular,
and the prominence of multinudear giant cells in the bone marrows
of recovered animals point to the importance of the bone marrow as
an active agent in increased blood destruction. In the recovered bone
marrow, not only were multinuclear giant cells unusually numerous,
but so called mature elements (polymorphonuclears and normoblasts)
were considerably more prominent than in animals killed during
transfusion.
In the other organs examined no noteworthy lesions were found.
In the three splenectomized dogs (Nos. 1, 3, and 7) the same changes
were found in the remaining hemopoietic organs, but they were more
marked. In fact, the greater pigment content of these organs, coupled
with the greater urobilin excretion, suggests from another point of
view Asher's (25) unconfirmed contention that the anemia of splenec-
tomy is due to a failure to reutilize the products of destroyed erythro-
cytes. The relatively greater bone marrow hyperplasia in these
animals has been described elsewhere (26) as occurring after splen-
ectomy. It should be noted again, however, that this is not necessarily
either wholly or in part a sign of increased hemopoiesis. In the
only dog actually killed by transfusions, the signs of blood destruction
were no greater, but congestion of all organs was most extreme. In
fact, in the lungs,spleen, and lymph nodes, large areas of packed eryth-
rocytes gave a picture indistinguishable from hemorrhage. It was
not possible, however, to establish conclusively the immediate cause
of death in this animal.
In the rabbits of this series, the outstanding feature was the wide-
spread evidence of agglutination and thrombosis. Not only is the
sudden death apparently to be explained by the extensive intravascu-
lar agglutination of blood cells and pigment, but also evidences of
former thrombi are to be found within the blood vessels and in the focal
necroses and fibroses of liver and spleen. The frequency of these
agglutination thrombi, as well as the general frailty of the rabbit,
militates strongly against its usefulness in this kind of work if experi-
ments are to be continued over a long period. The same deposition
of blood pigment in the various organs was found as in the dog, with
one exception. In the rabbit, as in human hemochromatosis, the
blood pigment is found in two forms: the iron-reacting granules of
EDWARD B. KRUMBHAA_R AND ALFRED CHANUTIN 865
hemosiderin, and minute semiopaque spicules that fail to react to
the usual iron tests (probably hemofuscin). This latter pigment is
especially prominent in the protoplasm of the liver cells (which in
dogs were never found to contain hemosiderin), but is also found in
large amounts in the various sites already mentioned.
DISCUSSION.
The relationship of artificial plethora to bone marrow activity as
indicated by the percentage of reticulocytes, emphasized in the case of
rabbits by Robertson (3), has been confirmed in these experiments
both with dogs and rabbits. We have found that with the develop-
ment of plethora the reticulocytes in the blood decreased, and that
after anemia developed a reticulosis was manifest in every case. Dur-
ing recovery from the experimental anemia the reticulocytes were
present in greatest numbers. This would indicate that while "living
blood" was being supplied in excess from outside, the normal factory
for erythrocytes suspended operation; the slow resumption of activ-
ity when erythrocytes were needed during the period of anemia
(about 1 to 2 weeks) points either to Itami's inactivity atrophy, or
to a bone marrow-inhibiting influence that required considerable
time for removal.
The urobilin excretion, which under the constant conditions of
these experiments can be taken as a reliable index of blood destruc-
tion, began to rise in the feces soon after transfusions were begun. It
was greater during the "plethoric anemia" than in extreme plethora,
but quickly lessened after transfusion was stopped. Although uro-
bilin could not be detected in the urine during the early stages of
plethora, it appeared there simultaneously with the occurrence of
extreme blood destruction. This accords with the findings of other
investigators that fecal urobilin may be greatly increased before it
appears in the urine.
Details of the manner in which blood is normally destroyed in the
body are still open to question. It was hoped that the addition of
large quantities of blood and the subsequent destruction of this excess
blood would disclose the underlying mechanism of blood destruction.
Phagocytosis has been considered as a possible means of blood destruc-
tion, and the importance of endothelial cells in the spleen and the
866 EXPEI~Im~ENTAL PLETHOKA
Kupffer cells of the liver has been pointed out by Pearce and Austin
(21). Rous and Robertson (24) found an appreciable phagocytosis
in dogs, but believe this would not suffice for normal blood destruc-
tion. It is unquestionable, however, that greatly increased phago-
cytosis of blood pigment occurs in artificial plethora, as it
does in many forms of increased blood destruction. The fragmenta-
tion of erythrocytes, which they consider an important factor in the
destruction of blood, was not observed by us in the circulation in
amounts greater than that seen under normal conditions. It is,
of course, possible that as we did not enter into the special procedures
that they undertook, this may have played a greater part than we
appreciate. The relation of the postmortem findings to this topic
has already been discussed.
It is well known that parenteral introduction of certain foreign
substances will cause the formation of antitoxins, agglutinins, and
hemolysins, and that antibodies may sometimes be formed after in-
jection of protein from the same species. It is quite obvious that
the first of these factors, namely antitoxins, may be eliminated in
these experiments. As previously mentioned, Robertson (3) and
Kambe and Komiya (4) have shown the presence of antibodies
capable of destroying erythrocytes, even of the same species, in large
numbers during plethora in rabbits; and isohemolysins and isoagglu-
tinins have been produced in cats after compatible transfusions (5).
In a further attempt to explain the mechanism of this "plethoric
anemia" by the production of agglutinins or hemolysins, ten rabbits
were transfused by us with 5 to 20 cc. of compatible rabbit blood daily,
according to the method previously described. Their blood changes
corresponded in the main with those we have reported in dogs, but at
no time were we able to demonstrate the presence of isoagglutinins
or isohemolysins. Thinking that in our previous study on dogs, anti-
bodies might have developed, but been absorbed by the daily repeated
injections, we discontinuedtransfusions on the anemic rabbits for vary-
ing lengths of time before the antibody tests were made. Carefully con-
trolled quantitative tests, with the complement fixation method, still
continued negative. We are therefore unable to aid in the solution
of this phase of the problem, and have no explanation as to why, like
Boycott and Douglas and other observers, we were unable to demon-
EDWARD B. KRUMBHAAR AND ALPRED CHANUTIN 867
strate either agglutinins or hemolysins while blood was obviously
being destroyed in greatly increased quantities and in spite of the
fact that in the rabbits agglutinative thrombl were found at autopsy.
Faulty technique, the most obvious explanation, we endeavored to
guard against most carefully. The ability of transfused rabbits to
survive was extremely slight for reasons already discussed under
the section on pathological anatomy.
In regard to the effect of splenectomy on plethora, and on the con-
sequent anemia, one cannot but be impressed by the more constant
and striking anemia ,of the dogs splenectomized during the course of
the transfusions (Nos. 6 and 7) than of those that were not splenec-
tomlzed (Nos. 4 and 5). In view of Hektoen's demonstration (27,
28) that under certain conditions antibody formation is lowered after
splenectomy, and of our inability to demonstrate antibodies at any
time, this anemia of splenectomized dogs can hardly be based on
such grounds; but we feel confident that some relationship exists
between the loss of the spleen and the marked anemia that developed.
It is also of interest that "plethoric anemia" is harder to produce in
dogs than in rabbits, animals whose spleens are relatively much
smaller (0.05 per cent of body weight as against 0.25 per cent of
dogs).
The two chief points of interest in the blood volume studies are:
(1) the confirmation of previous findings as to the constancy of the
plasma volume under widely varying conditions, and (2) the remark-
able adaptability of the organism in accommodating itself to rapid
increases in total blood volume reaching as high as 250 per cent of
the normal.
The metabolism studies have pointed out a marked retention of
nitrogen by the organism for a long period of time. We are not able
to learn from these experiments bow and when this excess nitrogen
is eliminated from the body. This retention and the failure of the
hemoglobin to rise appreciably during the first 10 days of transfusions
with a corresponding lack of increased nitrogen elimination would
seem to indicate the existence of a mechanism for the storage of con-
siderab!e excess blood and its decomposition products.

After incurring syphilis and other infectious diseases, the patient developed a
typical Vaquez polycythemia of 135 per cent hemoglobin, and blood count of
9,200,000 red cells. Several months later the blood picture gradually changed
to that of pernicious anemia, with megaloblasts, stippled red cells, normoblasts,
and urobflinuria. This condition was next followed by exhaustion of the hemo-
poietic system with absence of nucleated red cells, myelocytes, and platelets, a
steadily falling hemoglobin, and finally death from aplastic anemia.
SUMMARYAND CONCLUSIONS.
1. The effects of repeated transfusions of blood on the blood-de-
stroying and blood-forming apparatus of normal and splenectomized
dogs and rabbits have been described. An anemia which developed
despite continued blood transfusions in two dogs splenectomized
during plethora has also been studied.
2. The decrease or absence of reticulocytes from the blood
stream during plethora and their increase during "plethoric anemia"
are evidently due to depression and activation of bone marrow
activity. The response of the bone marrow is not immediate upon
the onset of anemia, but is delayed for several days.
3. The blood volume studies have served to emphasize the con-
stancy of plasma volume under extreme experimental conditions,
and the adaptability of the circulatory system to large increases in
total blood volume.
4. Blood destruction and elimination, as measured by urobilin
excretion, are greatly increased during the stage of plethora, but still
more so during "plethoric anemia."
5. Despite intravenous introductions of large quantities of nitro-
gen in the form of whole blood, the total nitrogen, urea, and ammonia
in the urine and feces are not raised appreciably for some time after
the onset of plethora. The normal organism is apparently able to
store large quantities of blood or its decomposition products. Upon
the onset of a "plethoric anemia," there is an increase in urinary total
nitrogen and urea excretion, which was lowered during the course
of the anemia. Albuminuria is also found at this time. Other
nitrogenous constituents and phosphates show no striking changes.
6. Blood pigment, chiefly in the form of hemosiderin, is deposited
in enormous quantities in the spleen, Hver, lymph nodes, and bone
marrow. It occurs chiefly in phagocytes, though in late stages large
EDWARD B. KRUMBHAAP. AND ALFRED CBA_NIITIN 869
extracellular masses are found. Increased pigment deposition can
still be found several months after transfusions have been stopped.
7. Phagocytes containing erythrocytes are found rarely, if at all,
and only in the acute cases, but their occurrence may be greatly
masked by the coexistent congestion.
8. In splenectomized dogs the tendency to "plethoric anemia" is
much more apparent, although a direct connection between the two
events is not established. In rabbits, whose spleens constitute only
0.05 per cent of body weight, "plethoric anemia" is more easily
produced.
9. In splenectomized animals pigment-bearing phagocytes are
especially prominent in the liver, although lymph nodes and bone
marrow apparently share in the extra work caused by the absence of
the spleen. Lymph nodes with some of the characteristics of hemo-
lymph nodes were found in various localities in all animals that had
been made plethoric.
10. In rabbits blood pigment is deposited in the hemopoietic or-
gans in large amounts, but under the conditions of our experiments,
the picture and the experiment have been constantly complicated by
early fatal intravascular agglutination and thrombosis. In the
rabbit, as in human hemochromatosis, the pigment is found in
two forms: hemosiderin granules, and smaller, dark spicules that
do not react to the usual iron stains (probably hemofuscin). The
latter pigment is also found seeded through the cells of the liver
parenchyma.
