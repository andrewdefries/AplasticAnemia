Summary Two clinical studies were undertaken to study the toxicity profile and effects of interleukin-3
(rhIL-3) on chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression.
Fifteen patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma were treated with high dose carboplatin (800 mg m-2). All
patients received 5.0 fig/kg/d rhIL-3 subcutaneously but timing and duration of rhIL-3 treatment differed.
Constitutional symptoms were the major toxicity and in addition to the carboplatin-induced nausea and
vomiting the combination was poorly tolerated. In 5/15 patients receiving high dose carboplatin rhIL-3
administration was discontinued due to nephrotoxicity (2 x ), hypotension, severe malaise and bone pain. In
this study, rhIL-3 ameliorated chemotherapy-induced neutropenia as well as thrombocytopenia and reduced
the requirement for platelet transfusions in the second cycle of chemotherapy. However, rhlL-3 failed to
prevent cumulative platelet toxicity.
In the second study 12 patients with small cell undifferentiated cancers were treated with carboplatin,
etoposide and ifosfamide. Three dose levels of rhIL-3 were explored (0.125, 5.0 and 7.5 pg/kg/d). In this study,
toxicity of the treatment was mild, however, no beneficial haematologic effects of rhIL-3 could be demon-
strated.
In conclusion, the haematological effects of rhIL-3 were modest and dependent on the chemotherapeutic
regimen, timing and duration of rhIL-3 treatment (in relation to the expected nadir). In general rhIL-3-
induced toxicity was mild, but combination with high dose carboplatin could be hazardous if rhIL-3 is
initiated at 24 h after the cytostatic agent.
Increasing the dose of certain cytostatic drugs may improve
treatment results in some chemosensitive tumours (Juttner et
al., 1989; Dunphy et al., 1990; de Vita et al., 1989). In
patients with ovarian cancer, cisplatin and carboplatin dem-
onstrated dose-related activity (Ozols et al., 1985; 1987) and
in these patients both probability of response and survival
are directly related to dose intensity of these compounds
(Levin & Hryniuk, 1987; Kaye et al., 1992). In small cell lung
cancer (SCLC) the clinical outcome may also correlate with
dose-intensity (Murray, 1987). Thus, increasing dose intensity
may improve the efficacy of chemotherapy in the treatment
of ovarian cancer and SCLC. Unfortunately, the degree of
dose escalation that may be achieved in practice is usually
limited by toxicity. For carboplatin the dose limiting toxicity
is myelosuppression, predominantly thrombocytopenia (Curt
et al., 1983; Egorin et al., 1984; Harland et al., 1984).
Shortening the duration and depth of chemotherapy-
induced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia should reduce
the incidence and severity of infections and bleeding com-
plications. Use of haematopoietic growth factors may prove
beneficial by reducing toxicity of chemotherapy. Granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macro-
phage CSF (GM-CSF) have clearly reduced the depth and
extent of neutrophil nadirs, and reduced the incidence of
serious infection (Ohno et al., 1990; Crawford et al., 1991; de
Vries et al., 1991). Unfortunately, neither G-CSF nor GM-
CSF could adequately ameliorate thrombocytopenia due to
cytotoxic therapy and therefore may not permit significant
dose escalation of drugs which are associated with thrombo-
cytopenia.
Recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhIL-3) is a multi-
lineage haemopoietin that promotes the growth and
differentiation of multipotent progenitor cells and committed
progenitor cells of the granulocyte/macrophage, eosinophil,
basophil, megakaryocyte, and erythroid lineages (Leary et al.,
1987; Saeland et al., 1989; Sonoda et al., 1988). Interleukin-3
has been shown to be a potent inducer of megakaryocyte
development and thrombopoiesis in vitro (Bruno et al., 1988;
Lu et al., 1988). Preclinical studies of rhIL-3 in animal
models showed a modest and delayed increase in neutrophils,
basophils, and eosinophils. Increases in reticulocyte counts
and variable increases in platelet counts were also observed
(Metcalf et al., 1986; Donahue et al., 1988; Wagemaker et al.,
1990).
Clinical experience with rhIL-3 is limited. Several studies
with rhIL-3 have been reported, including studies in patients
with advanced malignancies (Ganser et al., 1990a; Kurzrock
et al., 1991), myelodysplastic syndromes (Ganser et al.,
1990c), and aplastic anaemia (Ganser et al., 1990b). Only a
few studies have reported rhIL-3 administration in patients
with chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression (Kurzrock et
al., 1991; Biesma et al., 1992). These studies indicated that
rhIL-3 induced a multilineage response showing beneficial
effects on platelet counts at various doses.
Before haematophoietic growth factors can achieve wide-
spread use, it is essential to demonstrate their efficacy and
safety when given in combination with different chemo-
therapeutic regimens and in different schedules of administra-
tion. We therefore conducted two phase I/II studies with
rhIL-3 in patients with ovarian cancer and in patients with
small cell undifferentiated tumours. In the former study the
bone marrow was challenged with high doses of the
myelosuppressive agent carboplatin, while a more conven-
tional regimen was used in the second study. In this paper we
present the clinical results of these studies.
Patients and methods
Patient selection
Patients were treated with chemotherapy plus rhIL-3 in two
different protocols. Patients with ovarian carcinoma recurrent
after previous platinum-based chemotherapy were included in
the first study and patients with small cell undifferentiated
tumours in the second study. Most of the small cell tumours
originated in the lung and both patients with limited or
extensive disease were entered into the study. All patients

were less than 70 years of age, had a performance status of
>60% (Karnofsky scale) and a life expectancy of >2
months. Patients with severe heart, lung, liver (serum
bilirubin >25 jimol 1', SGOT of SGPT > 1.25 or normal)
or kidney impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 ml min- )
were excluded, as were patients with active infection,
evidence of central nervous system metastases or of other
malignancies. Evidence of adequate bone marrow function
(leucocyte count ) 3.5 x I091' and platelet count > 100 x
1091`) was required. All patients gave informed consent and
the protocols were approved by the Ethical and Scientific
review committees of the Netherlands Cancer Institute and
the Free University Hospital.
Recombinant human Interleukin-3
Escherichia Coli derived nonglycosylated rhIL-3 (2-10 x
106 U mg-' protein) was provided by Sandoz (Basel, Switzer-
land) as a lyophilised powder in vials of 150 g and 300 ig.
The drug was reconstituted with 1 ml sterile water prior to
administration as a daily subcutaneous injection.
Study design and treatment
(a) The ovarian carcinoma study Fifteen consecutive
patients with histologically verified recurrent ovarian car-
cinoma were entered into this study and treated with
800 mg m-2 carboplatin every 4 weeks for a total of four
cycles. Carboplatin (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ,
USA) dissolved in 500 ml 5% glucose, was infused over
60 min. Anti-emetic treatment consisted of ondansetron with
metoclopramide. RhIL-3 was administered subcutaneously at
5.0 jig/kg/d from the second cycle onwards and effects of
rhIL-3 were compared with the first cycle (control cycle). The
patients were divided into three groups of five patients each.
Group I was treated with rhIL-3 for 10 days, starting 24 h
after carboplatin administration. Group II also received
rhIL-3 for 10 days, but starting 48 h after carboplatin
infusion. In group III rhIL-3 was administered for 14 days,
starting 48 h after chemotherapy. Three patients received
rhIL-3 in the first cycle and therefore these cycles were not
considered as control cycles.
(b) The small cell undifferentiated tumour study Patients
with small cell undifferentiated tumours were treated with
carboplatin 350 mg m2 (Bristol-Myers Squibb) in a 30 min
infusion in 500 ml 5% glucose on day 1, etoposide 100 mg
m-2 (Bristol-Myers Squibb) as an infusion in 0.9% saline
over 30 min on days 1-3 and ifosfamide 5 g m 2 (Asta
Medica, Frankfurt, Germany) with an equivalent dose of
mesna (Asta Medica) in a 24 h infusion on day 1 in 2 litre
0.9% NaCl. This treatment was repeated at 4 weekly inter-
vals for six cycles provided that the disease did not progress.
The first cycle of chemotherapy was given without growth
factor. In the second cycle rhIL-3 was administered from
days 5-14. The same dose of chemotherapy was given in
cycle 1 and 2. Three groups of patients were treated with
rhIL-3 at the following dose levels: 0.125, 5.0 and 7.5 ljg/kg/
d. The study was terminated because rhIL-3 was no longer
supplied.
In both studies red blood cell transfusions were given when
the haemoglobin level dropped below 6.0 mmol 1i, and
platelet transfusions were administered at platelet counts
<10 x 1091' or when bleeding occurred. No prophylactic
antibiotics were administered. Acetaminophen (max. 3 g/day)
was given when headache occurred.
Clinical and laboratory monitoring
Complete haematological blood counts, including differential
cell counts, were performed every 2-3 days. Biochemical
analysis was carried out on a weekly basis and creatinine
clearance was measured every cycle. Axillary temperature
and subjective toxicity were recorded twice daily. Tumour
response was evaluated after each cycle of chemotherapy,
according to UICC criteria (Hayward et al., 1977).
Toxicity was graded according to the Common Toxicity
Criteria (CTC) (Wittes, 1989).
Flow cytometry
Circulating haematopoietic progenitor cells were identified in
peripheral blood obtained from patients recovering from high
dose carboplatin using flow cytometry as described by Siena
et al. (1991). Cells expressing the surface membrane CD34
antigen were identified with the FITC-conjugated CD34
murine monoclonal antibody (8G12 kindly provided by Dr
Peter Lansdorp, Vancouver, BC, Canada). The percentage of
CD34+-cells were determined by flow cytometric analysis
using a FACScan (Becton and Dickinson, Saolo Paolo, CA,
USA).
Statistical analysis
Differences between the subgroups with regard to factors that
might influence haematopoietic recovery were tested with the
Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon rank test. The Wilcoxon
matched-pairs signed rank test was used to test differences in
haematological values between cycles.
Results
Ovarian carcinoma study
Patient characteristics Fifteen patients were entered on
study. The median age was 53 years (range, 34-69 years) and
the median performance status was 80% (range, 60- 100%)
(Karnofsky scale). Five patients had a late relapse (>1 year),
three patients had an early relapse (<1 year) following
first-line chemotherapy and seven patients were refractory to
previous chemotherapy. All patients had received at least six
cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy (median 6, range:
6-15 cycles). The median time from diagnosis was 28 months
(range, 6-154 months) and from last chemotherapy 6 months
(range 1-64 months). Creatinine clearance (mean ± s.d.) at
entry was 75 ± 8.5 ml min-', 80 ± 10.7 ml min-', and 83 +
17.3 ml min-' in group I, II and III, respectively. No
significant differences could be found between the three
patient populations, particularly when factors that might
influence haematopoietic recovery were considered, i.e. per-
formance status, age and time since or extent of previous
pretreatment.
Side effects RhIL-3 was administered in 31 cycles of carbo-
platin which were evaluable for toxicity (group I: 7, group II:
12, group III: 12). In these cycles, the most frequently
observed rhIL-3-related side effects were low-grade fever
(CTC grade I) and headache (CTC grade I-II) (Table I),
which usually responded to acetaminophen. Facial flushing
and diffuse erythema were noticed in a majority of the cycles
(19/31). These usually started 1 -6 h after rhIL-3 administra-
tion and were most pronounced during the first days of
treatment. In two patients local infiltrates at the injection site
were seen. Other minor side effects consisted of muscle or
bone pain and chills.
Beside the myelosuppression, side effects observed in cycles
without rhIL-3 (control cycles) consisted of malaise,
headache and chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting
(CTC grade III and IV), which had stopped within a week of
chemotherapy. In cycles with rhIL-3, nausea and vomiting
were more pronounced and extended over a longer period of
time. After day 7, patients with rhIL-3 still experienced
episodes of nausea (14/31) usually accompanied by vomiting
(11/31) (Table I). Together with the malaise, headache and
fever, this meant that high dose carboplatin in combination
with rhIL-3 was poorly tolerated.
In 5/15 patients rhIL-3 was stopped due to toxicity. This
occurred three times in group I in the first cycle with rhIL-3

and twice in groups II and III in the third cycle. The reasons
for discontinuation were nephrotoxicity in two patients and
severe malaise, hypotension or bone pain in three other
patients. Renal function impairment and a drop in blood
pressure occurred in 2/31 and 5/31 cycles, respectively.
In group I, when rhIL-3 was administered 24 h after
carboplatin infusion, the toxicity was most marked. One to
24 h after rhIL-3 administration all five patients developed a
drop in mean arterial pressure ranging from 20% to 45% of
initial values and in two of these patients serum creatinine
levels were found to be elevated (360 and 365 tmol 1-1) on
days 4 and 5. Both patients experienced grade IV nausea and
vomiting, high grade fever (>39°C) and facial flushing and
became dehydrated. After discontinuation of rhIL-3, blood
pressure normalised in both patients. In one patient serum
creatinine levels returned to normal in 1 week. In the other
patient, with an initial marginal renal function, serum
creatinine levels rose to 713 ,umol [I despite appropriate sup-
portive measures. Two weeks later she developed septicaemia
with severe thrombocytopenia. At the request of the patient
treatment was discontinued and she died from haemorrhagic
complications.
In group II, rhIL-3 administration was started 48 h instead
of 24 h after carboplatin infusion. In view of the observed
toxicity in group I, these patients were extensively hydrated
pre- and post-carboplatin administration. In the remaining
ten patients no further nephrotoxicity was observed.
Creatinine clearance at entry to each cycle did not differ
significantly among the three groups (Table II). One patient
experienced a 40% decrease in mean arterial blood pressure
12 h after the first rhIL-3 administration in the fourth cycle
and subsequently rhIL-3 treated was stopped. Forty-eight
hours after rhIL-3 administration blood pressure had
returned to normal. No changes in blood pressure requiring
therapy were observed in the other nine patients.
Haematological recovery A total of 27 cycles of rhIL-3 were
completed in 12 patients. Eleven patients were evaluable for
efficacy of rhIL-3, one patient was not evaluable because of
dose reduction of carboplatin in cycle 2. Treatment with
800 mg m-2 carboplatin in cycle 1 induced severe myelosup-
pression in all patients (Table II). The absolute neutrophil
count fell to a median of 0.15 x I0'1 ' and the nadir occur-
red between days 16 and 21. Recovery of neutrophils (to
> 1.5 x 109 l-l) did not occur until day 26.
No significant difference in neutrophil or platelet nadir or
in duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was
observed between 10 days (group II) and 14 days (group III)
of rhIL-3 administration. The data from these two groups
have therefore been combined in Table II. Administration of
rhIL-3 in the second cycle of chemotherapy significantly
reduced both the neutrophil nadir and the duration of
neutropenia. The median absolute neutrophil count nadir
increased to 0.27 x 1091' (P<0.05) and duration of grade
IV neutropenia ( < 0.5 x 109 I`) was shortened to a median
of 3 days from a median of 9 days in cycle 1 (P<0.01)
(Figure 1 and Table II). No significant difference was found
for the absolute neutrophil count on day 28 of cycle 2
compared with the same time in cycle 1. However, postpone-
ment of chemotherapy by 1 or 2 weeks because of leucopenia
(<3.5 x 1091-') occurred in 4/10 patients after the second
cycle (with rhIL-3), as compared with postponement after the
first cycle in 8/11 patients (without rhIL-3).
The platelet nadirs were not significantly different in cycles

1 and 2 (Figure 2 and Table II). However, the median
duration of thrombocytopenia grade III and IV was
significantly shorter (cycle 1: grade III: 9 days; grade IV: 4
days vs cycle 2: grade III: 5 days (P <0.05); grade IV: 2 days
(P<0.01)). In addition, the recovery of platelets was faster
and platelet numbers were higher on day 21 of cycle 2 than
of cycle 1 (P<0.005). Platelet transfusion were necessary in
1/11 patients (9%) in the second cycle of chemotherapy
compared with 7/11 patients (64%) in the first cycle
(P < 0.05).
RhIL-3 also demonstrated an effect on the eosinophil
count. In seven of the 12 patients who completed rhIL-3
administration, a relative eosinophilia (>6%) was noticed
(day 12, median: 11%, range: 7-34%) compared with 2/12
patients in control cycles (range: 7-8%). No effects were
observed on basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes or myeloid
progenitor cells. At day 14 and 21 median reticulocyte counts
were higher in cycle 2 than in the first cycle (day 14: 7% vs
0%; day 21: 21% vs 4%).
In eight patients CD34 + cells were measured in peripheral
blood samples. Peak levels in cycle 1 and 2 were not
significantly different (median percentage CD34 + cells in
mononuclear cell fraction in cycle 1 without rhIL-3: 0.55%
(range 0-2.8); with rhIL-3: 0.3% (range 0-1.8)). In fact in
five of the eight patients the percentage CD34+ cells was
higher in cycle 1.
Administration of rhIL-3 in ten patients in the third cycle
of chemotherapy again demonstrated an effect on the neutro-
phil nadir and on the duration of neutropenia as compared
with the first chemotherapy cycle. The median nadir of
platelet count was however significantly lower than in the
first cycle (P<0.05) and the duration of thrombocytopenia
grade III and IV was longer (P<0.01 and P<0.05) (Table
II). Platelet transfusions were necessary in six of the ten
patients (60%) and in two patients chemotherapy was stop-
ped because of a prolonged thrombocytopenia.
Tumour response Ten of 14 patients who were evaluable for
response, showed a response to treatment (two clinical com-
plete responses, eight partial responses, one stable disease
and three progressive disease). The overall response rate in
these 14 patients was 71% (95% confidence interval,
41-90%). The median time to disease progression was 8
months (range, 2-11 + months).
Small cell undifferentiated tumour study
Patient characteristics Twelve patients with histologically
proven small cell undifferentiated tumours were entered in
this study. The median age was 64 years (range, 35-70 years)
and the median performance status was 80% (range,
70-100%) (Karnofsky scale). Nine patients had small cell
cancers of the lung (five patients had limited and four
extended disease). The other patients had a small cell
undifferentiated tumour originating from hypopharynx, cer-
vix or thyroid respectively. Five patients were entered in
group A (rhIL-3: 0.125 ,ug/kg/d), five patients in group B
(5.0 pg/kg/d) and two patients were entered in group C
(7.5 ,ig/kg/d). Creatinine clearance (mean ± s.d.) at entry was
112 ± 19.8 ml min-', 121 ± 34.4 ml min-', and 104 + 5.0 ml
min-' in group A, B and C, respectively. There was no
significant difference between the three patient groups in
terms of performance status or age.
Side effects In the cycles without rhIL-3 toxicity consisted
of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CTC grade
III). One patient in group I encountered a severe sepsis in the
first cycle and was subsequently removed from the study.

Therefore, 11 cycles with rhIL-3 (group A= 0.125 jig/kg/d:
4 pts; group B = 5.0 Ag/kg/d: 5 pts; group C = 7.5 ig/kg/d:
2 pts) were evaluable for toxicity. In cycles with rhIL-3, the
side effects were mild (CTC grade I and II) and consisted of
low grade fever, nausea and malaise (Table III). Skin abnor-
malities developed in 4/11 cycles and consisted of local
infiltration at the injection site (1 pt), facial flushing (2 pts)
and urticaria (1 pt). In four patients a significant decrease in
blood pressure was noticed 1-24 h after rhIL-3 administra-
tion, however, this effect was not dose related. In none of
these patients rhIL-3 treatment had to be discontinued.
Haematological recovery The treatment with carboplatin
350 mg m2 (day 1), ifosfamide 5 g m2 (day 1) and etopo-
side 100 mg m-2 (day 1-3) produced severe myelosuppres-
sion in the first cycle (Table IV). The absolute neutrophil
count fell to a median of 0.08 x 1091 (range 0.01-0.34 x
l09'11) and nadir occurred between days 10 and 12. The
median duration of neutropenia (<0.5 x 1091-') was 7 days
(range, 4-12 days) and recovery of neutrophils to
> 1.5 x 10 l-' did not occur until day 16. Chemotherapy-
induced thrombocytopenia occurred, the median platelet
count nadir falling to 51 x 109l-l (range, 30-116 x 109) with
a median duration of grade III thrombocytopenia
(<50 x 1091-) of 1 day (range, 0-5 days). No platelet
transfusions were required during the first cycle and cycle
two started on time in all patients.
In 11 patients the haematological effects of rhIL-3 adminis-
tration in cycle 2 could be compared with the first cycle
(group A: 4 pts; group B: 5 pts; group C: 2 pts). No
significant differences in the depth of duration of the nadir of
neutrophils or platelets were seen between cycle 1 and 2 for
all groups (Table IV).
No effects were observed on basophils, monocytes, lym-

and all patients had measurable disease. Five patients
received all six cycles of chemotherapy, three patients five

Of 11 evaluable patients, five patients had a complete
response, another three patients had a partial response and
three patients had stable disease. The overall response rate in
these 11 patients was 73% (95% confidence interval,
40-93%). The median time to disease progression was 7

Discussion
We conducted two clinical studies to assess the efficacy and
toxicity of recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhIL-3) in
ameliorating chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. Both
carboplatin-containing regimens produced a marked degree
of myelosuppression. In the ovarian carcinoma study,
administration of rhIL-3 in the second cycle of chemotherapy
significantly reduced the neutrophil nadir and shortened the
duration of grade IV neutropenia, a threshold known to be
critical in view of infective complications (Bodey et al., 1965).
In this study no effect was seen on the platelet nadir, but
rhIL-3 significantly shortened the duration of the chemo-
therapy-induced thrombocytopenia and reduced the number
of platelet transfusions required which reached clinically
relevant levels. Despite the continued use of rhIL-3, a pro-
gressive and severe thrombocytopenia developed when
repeated cycles of high-dose chemotherapy were admini-
stered. A prolongation of the rhIL-3 administration from 10
to 14 days did not influence the severity or duration of
thrombocytopenia. A possible explanation for the failure of
rhIL-3 to offer protection in the third cycle is cumulative
myelotoxicity of high dose carboplatin in conjunction with
heavy pretreatment. It is known that carboplatin is a stem
cell toxin (Schmalbach & Borch, 1989; Teicher et al., 1989)
and that haematopoietic growth factors are less effective in
patients with reduced bone marrow reserve (Morstyn et al.,
1988). Other explanations could be induction of negative
feedback loops by natural inhibitors of the haematopoiesis
(Graham et al., 1990; Keller et al., 1990) and generation of
rhIL-3-neutralising antibodies. However, antibodies against
rhIL-3 have not been identified in over 500 samples from
patients treated with rhIL-3 (personal communication, T.C.
Jones, Sandoz Pharma Ltd, Basle).
In the small cell tumour study administration of rhIL-3 in
the second cycle of chemotherapy did not protect against
myelotoxicity. The difference in the effect of rhIL-3 in these
two studies requires explanation. RhIL-3 stimulates
haematopoiesis at the level of the multipotent and lineage-
committed progenitor cells, resulting in a gradual appearance
(after 5-10 days) of neutrophils, platelets and reticulocytes in
the peripheral blood (Leary et al., 1987; Messner et al., 1987;
Sonoda et al., 1988). In the study of Ganser et al. in patients
with normal haematopoiesis elevation of neutrophil and
platelet counts was observed 1 week after the start of rhIL-3
treatment and maximum counts were reached between days
15 and 20 (Ganser et al., 1990a). In the small cell tumour
study, where rhIL-3 was begun 6 days after the first day of
chemotherapy, the median time between the start of rhIL-3
treatment and occurrence of the nadir was 6 days (range,
5-7 days) and for the ovarian carcinoma study, where rhIL-
3 began within 48 h of chemotherapy, this was 15 days
(range, 13-17 days). These data suggest that rhIL-3 can have
an effect on chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and throm-
bocytopenia if there is sufficient time between the start of the
rhIL-3 treatment and the occurrence of the nadir. It should
be emphasised that efficacy of rhIL-3 remains to be evaluated
in a double blind placebo controlled study.
Chemotherapy can mobilise CD34 positive progenitor cells
into the peripheral blood (Richman et al., 1976; Reiffers et
al., 1986; To et al., 1990). RhIL-3 can expand the pool of
circulating progenitors (Geissler et al., 1990; Brugger et al.,
1992); an effect seen also with G-CSF and GM-CSF (Socin-
ski et al., 1988; Duhrsen et al., 1988; Gianni et al., 1989). In
the ovarian carcinoma study, CD34 positive progenitor cells
transiently circulated in the peripheral blood in the first cycle
of chemotherapy, however, rhIL-3 did not enhance the re-
cruitment of CD34 positive cells. In our study patients had
been extensively pretreated, a factor known to be associated
with poor mobilisation of progenitor cells (To et al., 1990).
In addition, haematopoietic recovery after carboplatin chemo-
therapy is slow and this may mitigate against a rebound in-
crease in progenitor cells and the mobilising effect of rhIL-3.
Of particular interest is the rhIL-3 related toxicity observed
in the two studies. In the small cell tumour study the
observed toxicity in patients treated with rhIL-3 up to a dose
of 7.5 jig kg/d was similar to that reported by others (Ganser
et al., 1990a; Kurzrock et al., 1991; Biesma et al., 1992). In
the ovarian carcinoma study, the adverse events considered
to be related to rhIL-3 were more pronounced and severe
toxicity was encountered. The side effects, such as headache,
fever, and malaise, may be related to high dose carboplatin
but administration of rhIL-3 clearly worsened these
chemotherapy associated toxicities. These side effects together
with the prolongation of nausea and vomiting meant that the
combination of high dose carboplatin and rhIL-3 was poorly
tolerated.
The difference in toxicity between the two studies, partic-
ularly hypotension, nephrotoxicity and malaise, is striking.
The toxicity was most marked when rhIL-3 was administered
24 h after carboplatin infusion (group I) and in this group
rhIL-3 treatment was stopped due to nephrotoxicity in two
patients and severe malaise in one other. No severe nephro-
toxicity has been encountered in our earlier studies, in which
patients were treated with 800 mg m-2 carboplatin alone or
in combination with GM-CSF (Ten Bokkel Huinink et al.,
1992). In published series, the incidence of renal side effects
with carboplatin has varied from 0% to 35% (Calvert et al.,
1982; Adams et al., 1989; Mangioni et al., 1989). Acute renal
failure attributable to this drug is rare and only a few cases
of renal failure have been reported in the literature (Curt et
al., 1983; Lee et al., 1988; McDonald et al., 1991). Gore et al.
noted decrements in glomerular filtration rate at all dose
ranges when treating patients with doses of carboplatin of
800 mg m-2 or higher (Gore et al., 1987). The observed
nephrotoxicity in our study could be attributable to carbo-
platin and was likely aggravated by the rhIL-3-induced
hypotension.
A significant decrease in blood pressure was noticed
1-24 h after rhIL-3 administration in both studies (ovarian
carcinoma study: 9/31 cycles, small cell tumour study: 4/11
cycles). In one patient, treated with 0.1251tg kg-' or rhIL-3,
significant drop in blood pressure occurred, indicating that
even a low dose of rhIL-3 could be associated with hypoten-
sion.
In the ovarian cancer study, acute toxicity with hypoten-
sion and renal dysfunction could be reduced by hyperhydra-
tion and delaying beginning rhIL-3-treatment to 48 h after
1002 M.W. DERCKSEN et al.
chemotherapy. Toxicity was less in the small cell study. These
patients, which were treated with a different chemo-
therapeutic regimen, had received no prior chemotherapy, the
creatinine clearance was higher, the dose of carboplatin was
lower, and rhIL-3 was started later in the chemotherapy
cycle. These factors could explain the differences in observed
toxicity between the two studies. However, the high dose of
carboplatin is likely the most important cause of the exces-
sive toxicity observed with the combination in the ovarian
carcinoma study.
In conclusion, this report demonstrates that rhIL-3 has the
capacity to ameliorate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia as
well as thrombocytopenia. As used in the studies here, how-
ever, rhIL-3 could not prevent cumulative platelet toxicity
due to multiple doses of high dose carboplatin. The
haematological effects and the toxicity are dependent on the
chosen chemotherapeutic regimen, schedule, dose and dura-
tion of rhIL-3 treatment. The combination of high dose
carboplatin-containing regimens and rhIL-3 may cause severe
toxicity, such as hypotension and nephrotoxicity, when the
scheduling allows overlapping of the toxic effects of both
agents.
