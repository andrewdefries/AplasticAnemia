Abstract
Background: Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is often used in the treatment of various
diseases. Before BMT, patients are submitted to a conditioning regimen (CR), which consists of the
administration of high doses of chemotherapy. The action of many cytostatic drugs involves the
overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which together with inadequate antioxidant protection
can lead to oxidative stress and this has been implicated in the etiology of various diseases. The
objectives of this study were to look for evidence of oxidative stress and also to analyze δ-
Aminolevulinato dehydratase (δ-ALA-D) activity as a possible marker of oxidative stress in
autologous and allogeneic BMT patients.
Methods: Lipid peroxidation, vitamin C and thiol group levels as well as catalase, superoxide
dismutase and δ-ALA-D activity were determined in 37 healthy controls, 13 patients undergoing
autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and 24 patients undergoing allogeneic BMT.
Results: We found that patients presented signs of oxidative stress before they were submitted
to BMT, during CR and up to 20 days after BMT. There was a decrease in enzymatic and non
enzymatic antioxidant defenses, in δ-ALA-D activity, and an increase in lipoperoxidation in the
blood of both patient groups.
Conclusion: This study has indicated that autologous and allogeneic BMT are associated with
oxidative stress. Moreover, blood δ-ALA-D activity seems to be an additional biomarker of
oxidative stress in BMT patients.
Background
Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a therapeutic
method used in various malignant, hematologic, immu-
nologic, and genetic diseases [1]. Allogeneic transplanta-
tion involves the transfer of marrow from a donor to
another person, and one of the main problems in this pro-
cedure is the graft-versus-host disease [2]. Allogeneic
transplantations are preferred for patients with leukemias
or myeloproliferative diseases [3] whereas autologous
transplantations are generally performed in patients with

multiple myeloma (MM) or lymphoma [4,5]. Autologous
BMT involves the use of the patient's own marrow to rees-
tablish hematopoietic cell function after the administra-
tion of high-dose chemotherapy. In this case the stem cells
can be taken from the patient's bone marrow or periph-
eral blood [2]. Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
(PBSCT) with collection by apheresis has replaced bone
marrow as a source of hematopoietic stem cells for autol-
ogous transplantation, because this type of collection
results in a more rapid hematopoietic recovery [5,6]. In
contrast, in allogeneic transplantation, bone marrow con-
tinues to be the principal source of cells [7].
Unlike allogeneic transplantation, autologous transplan-
tation is a more simple procedure that can be performed
safely in older patients, because there is no risk of graft-
versus-host disease as a complication [2]. However, the
high incidence of relapse as a consequence of reinfusion
of malignant stem cells is an important problem in autol-
ogous BMT [5].
BMT is always associated with intense and variable
organic toxicity and with severe and prolonged myelosup-
pression, which give rise to a period of high vulnerability
in which patients may develop complications. Adminis-
tration of high doses of chemotherapy with or without
total body irradiation (TBI) is a feature of BMT protocols
known as the CR. These regimens are designed to abate
the underlying malignant cells in the autologous BMT, to
cause immunosuppression in order to avoid destruction
of the allograft, and to destroy any residual cancer cells in
allogeneic BMT [2].
The production of free radicals and the deficiency of anti-
oxidants can to lead to a condition known as oxidative
stress, which can be associated with serious complications
in different types of transplantation [8]. Chemotherapy
and radiotherapy are associated with the generation of
large amounts of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species and
depletion of antioxidants (vitamins A, C and E, reduced
glutathione-GSH) and with an increase in plasma lipid
hydroperoxides and TBARS [9-16]. Sulfhydryl groups (-
SH) play important roles in a variety of cell activities and
they can be easily modified by oxidants or alkylating
agents [17]. In fact, -SH group content can be depleted
after disproportional oxidation by free radicals or after
formation of adducts with reactive chemicals [18].
δ-Aminolevulinate dehydratase (δ-ALA-D) is a sulfhydryl-
containing enzyme [19,20] that catalyses the synthesis of
tetrapyrrolic compounds such as billins and hemes. Con-
sequently, δ-ALA-D is essential for aerobic organisms
[21,22]. Recently, data from literature and from our labo-
ratory have indicated that δ-ALA-D is sensitive to situa-
tions associated with oxidative stress [23-27].
Furthermore, enzyme inhibition can lead to accumula-
tion of its substrate, 5-aminolevulinate (ALA), in the
blood, which in turn can intensify oxidative stress by gen-
erating carbon-centered reactive species or by releasing
iron from proteins such as ferritin [28].
The BMT procedure is toxic and excessive free radical pro-
duction has been implicated in the action of many cyto-
static drugs [29], but little is known about how cytostatic
drugs affect the antioxidative system in human beings and
only a few studies have been performed in the clinical set-
ting [10]. In this context, the objective of this study was to
look for further evidence of oxidative stress and also to
analyze δ-ALA-D activity as a possible marker of oxidative
stress in autologous and allogeneic BMT patients as well
as to compare these two procedure in order to determine
whether either of them could be less toxic to patients,
when markers of oxidative stress are used as the end point
of toxicity.
Methods
Subjects
Altogether, 37 patients: 13 undergoing autologous
PBSCT, 03 female and 10 male, mean age 48.15 ± 12.67
years, 24 undergoing allogeneic BMT, 12 female and 12
male, mean age 34.13 ± 15.41 and 37 controls (matched
by age and sex with the patients) were included in the
investigation (samples were obtained from March 2007 to
March 2008). The patients were under treatment in the
'Hospital Universitário' from the 'Universidade Federal de
Santa Maria' (HUSM), RS, Brazil. They were treated with
autologous PBSCT or allogeneic BMT which were pre-
ceded by CR (see table 1).
The present study was approved by the Human Ethical
Committee of the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria,
protocol number 0152.0243.000-06. All persons gave
their informed consent prior to their inclusion in the
study.
The subjects included in the study were classified in three
groups: Group I – Control: healthy volunteers of HUSM
Blood Bank served as control group and they were receiv-
ing no treatment for any diseases; Group II (autol.): autol-
ogous PBSCT patients; Group III (allog.): allogeneic BMT
patients.
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the patients included
in this study.
In our study, the patients were significantly older in group
II (autol.) than in group III (allog.), p < 0.05. This is in
agreement with the literature, where 40 to 55 years is con-
sidered the oldest age for patients undergoing allogeneic
transplantation and autologous transplantation is

reported to be safer in older patients, because there is no
risk of graft-versus-host disease as a complication [2]. In
our study there were also fewer females in group II
(autol.) than in group III (alog.), perhaps because the
autologous procedure is utilized for treatment of diseases
that are predominant in males, such as lymphomas. Some
studies have shown a male predominance in this disease
[30-32] as well as in myeloma [33].
Sample collection
Blood (4 mL) was collected during routine examinations
by venous arm puncture in EDTA vaccutainer tubes in the
Hematology and Oncology Laboratory. The blood used in
this study was the leftover of this 4 mL sample. Four sam-
ples of each patient were taken, the first before CR, the sec-
ond during CR (the last day the patient received
chemotherapy), the third 10 days after BMT and the
fourth 20 days after BMT. Control group samples were the
leftover blood of HUSM Blood Bank donors, which was
collected on the same day of the matched patient. Only
one sample was used from these volunteers (before CR,
CR, 10 and 20 days after BMT, consequently, control val-
ues for each time point are from different subjects). The
plasma and cells were separated by centrifugation at 1000

rpm for 12 min. Then a portion of the collected plasma
and erythrocytes were stored for analysis at -20°C for less
than 3 weeks. The other analyses were performed on the
same day.
Biochemical estimations
All biochemical assays were made in duplicates or tripli-
cates, depending on the availability of samples.
Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances
Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) assay
measures the peroxidative damage to lipids that occurs by
excessive ROS generation. Lipid peroxidation was esti-
mated in plasma according to the method of Lappena et
al. (2001), using 1% phosphoric acid and 0.6% thiobarbi-
turic acid (TBA). The pink chromogen produced by reac-
tion of TBA with malondialdehyde (MDA), was measured
spectrophotometrically at 532 nm. The results were
expressed as nmol TBARS/mL plasma, using MDA as
standard [34].
Catalase enzyme activity
Catalase (CAT) enzyme activity was measured by the
method of Aebi (1984). Packed erythrocytes were hemo-
lyzed by adding 100 volumes of distilled water, then, 20
μL of this hemolyzed sample was added to a cuvette and
the reaction was started by the addition of 100 μL of
freshly prepared 300 mM H2O2 in phosphate buffer (50
mM, pH 7.0) to give a final volume of 1 mL. The rate of
H2O2 decomposition was measured spectrophotometri-
cally at 240 nm during 120 s. The catalase activity was
expressed as μmol H2O2/mL erythrocytes/min [35].
Superoxide dismutase enzyme activity
Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was performed
according to the method of Misra and Fridovich (1972).
Briefly, epinephrine rapidly auto oxidizes at pH 10.5 pro-
ducing adrenochrome, a pink colored product that can be
detected at 480 nm. The addition of samples containing
SOD inhibits epinephrine auto-oxidation. The inhibition
rate was monitored during 150 s at intervals of 10 s. The
amount of enzyme required to produce 50% inhibition at
25°C was defined as one unit of enzyme activity. The SOD
activity was expressed as U/mL erythrocytes [36].
Vitamin C
Plasma vitamin C (VIT C) was estimated as described by
Galley et al. (1996) with some modifications by Jacqes-
Silva et al. (2001). Plasma was precipitated with 1 volume
of a cold 5% trichloroacetic acid solution followed by cen-
trifugation. An aliquot of 300 μL of the supernatants were
mixed with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (4.5 mg/mL) and
13.3% trichloroacetic acid and incubated for 3 h at 37°C.
Then, 1 mL 65% sulfuric acid was added to the medium
and the orange red compound was measured at 520 nm.
The content of ascorbic acid was calculated using a stand-
ard curve (1.5 – 4.5 μmol/L ascorbic acid freshly prepared
in sulfuric acid) and expressed as μg vit C/mL plasma
[37,38].
Protein thiol groups
Protein thiol groups (P-SH) were assayed in plasma by the
method of Boyne and Ellman (1972) modified by
Jacques-Silva et al. (2001), which consisted of the reduc-
tion of 5.5'-dithio(bis-nithrobenzoic) acid (DTNB) in 0.3
M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, measured at 412 nm. Quan-
tification of total protein-SH groups may indicate thiol
status and may also indicate the general state of thiol-con-
taining proteins and, indirectly, the redox state of the
blood cells. A standard curve using glutathione was con-
structed in order to calculate the protein thiol groups. The
results were expressed as nmol P-SH/mL plasma [39,38].
Non protein thiol groups
Erythrocyte non protein thiol groups (NP-SH) were deter-
mined as described by Boyne and Ellman (1972) modi-
fied by Jacques-Silva et al. (2001). Red blood cell pellets
(300 μL) obtained after centrifugation of whole blood
were hemolyzed with 10% triton solution (100 μL) for 10
min. Then, the protein fraction was precipitated with 200
μL of 20% trichloroacetic acid followed by centrifugation.
Quantification of non-protein thiols (NP-SH) may indi-
cate 90% of GSH content in the blood [40], which is one
of the most important reducing agents in different mam-
mal cells [16]. The colorimetric assay was carried out in 1
M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. A standard curve using glu-
tathione was constructed in order to calculate non protein
thiol groups. The NP-SH level was measured at 412 nm
and expressed as nmol NP-SH/mL erythrocytes. [39,38].
δ-Aminolevulinate dehydratase (δ-ALA-D) activity
δ-Aminolevulinate dehydratase (δ-ALA-D) activity was
assayed in whole blood by the method of Berlin and
Schaller [41] by measuring the rate of porphobilinogen
(PBG) formation in 1 h at 37°C. The enzyme reaction was
initiated after 10 min of pre-incubation of blood with 1
mM ZnCl2. The reaction was started by adding δ-aminole-
vulinic acid (ALA) to a final concentration of 4 mM in a
phosphate buffered solution, and incubation was carried
out for 1 h at 37°C and the reaction product was meas-
ured at 555 nm and expressed as nmol PBG/mL blood/h.
Statistical analysis
Biochemical assay results were expressed as median
(lower/upper quartiles) and ages were expressed as mean
± SD.
Since data had no homogeneity of variance, statistical
analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA fol-
lowed by Mann-Whitney U test to compare the difference

among the groups, Friedman ANOVA followed by Wil-
coxon test to analyze changes in blood indices over time
and Spearman correlation to analyze correlations between
biochemical estimations. Test T was used to compare the
difference in the ages and sex among the groups. A value
of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

trol). P-SH levels in groups II and III were not significantly
different from each other. P-SH levels decreased from
before CR to day 20 after BMT in the patients of group III
and decreased from during CR to day 20 after BMT in
group II (p < 0.05), (table 4).

Correlations of biochemical estimations
Statistical analysis (Spearman correlation) revealed a sig-
nificant negative correlation between TBARS and P-SH
and a positive correlation between SOD and δ-ALA-D
before CR for all groups (Additional file 1: Panel 1, A).
There was significant negative correlation between TBARS
and CAT, P-SH and δ-ALA-D and a positive correlation
between VIT C and P-SH and δ-ALA-D as well as between
CAT and SOD and δ-ALA-D and also between δ-ALA-D
and SOD and P-SH during CR for all groups (Additional
file 1: Panel 1, B). There was a significant negative correla-
tion between TBARS and VIT C, SOD, P-SH and δ-ALA-D
and a positive correlation between VIT C and SOD, P-SH
and δ-ALA-D as well as between CAT and SOD and
between SOD and P-SH and δ-ALA-D and also between P-
SH with δ-ALA-D on day 10 after BMT for all groups
(Additional file 1: Panel 1, C). There was a significant neg-
ative correlation between TBARS and VIT C, P-SH and δ-
ALA-D and a positive correlation between VIT C and P-SH
and δ-ALA-D as well as between CAT and SOD and also
between P-SH and δ-ALA-D on day 20 after BMT for all
groups (Additional file 1: Panel 1, D).
Discussion
Lipid peroxidation can cause a profound alteration in the
structural integrity and functions of cell membranes and
free radical-induced lipid peroxidation has been impli-
cated in the pathogenesis of several disorders, including

cancer [42]. Treatment with radiotherapy and chemother-
apy has been shown to cause peroxide accumulation
[9,13,43-45]. In our study, both procedures, autologous
PBSCT and allogeneic BMT, were associated with higher
TBARS levels during CR, and after BMT when compared
with group I (control) and TBARS also showed a negative
correlation with the antioxidants. However, in group II
(autol.), this increase was already present before CR and
there was no further increase in lipid peroxidation, prob-
ably because of the disease itself and procedures carried
out previously, such as chemotherapy that precedes the
collection of the patient's own bone marrow for posterior
use in BMT. However, in group III (allog.), there was an
increase in TBARS levels over time. This indicates that,
principally in group III, both the CR and the procedure
itself (BMT) were associated with an increase in lipid per-
oxidation.
Vitamin C is a powerful reducing agent and an important
water-soluble vitamin for humans and it can scavenge
O2
•-, H2O2, OH•, aqueous peroxy radicals and singlet oxy-
gen. Vitamin C also protects plasma lipids against lipid
peroxidation and has an important role in the regenera-
tion of α-tocopherol [46]. VIT C levels were lower in the
plasma of patients from groups II (autol.) and III (allog.)
than in group I (control), at all time points analyzed and

VIT C also showed a negative correlation with TBARS. The
CR in both procedures, autologous PBSCT and allogeneic
BMT, caused a decrease in VIT C, indicating that this anti-
oxidant defense was impaired in both groups. These
results are in agreement with data published in literature
[13].
Thiols fulfill important antioxidant functions in cells and
biological fluids. The changes in the content of -SH
groups, may indicate membrane protein damage [47].
Alkylating agents, a common group of drugs utilized in
the CR, produce free radicals that can directly interact with
thiol groups of proteins [17], oxidizing them to disulfides
[18]. In our study, autologous and allogeneic patients pre-
sented plasma P-SH levels lower than those of healthy vol-
unteers and also a negative correlation with TBARS, at all
time points analyzed. There was also a decrease in plasma
P-SH levels after the CR and BMT, demonstrating that the
protein thiol groups were oxidized by cytostatic drugs uti-
lized in the CR preceding BMT. Erythrocyte NP-SH group
levels in the patient groups were not significantly different
from those of the control group, however, NP-SH levels
were lower in allogeneic patients (group III) than in autol-
ogous patients (group II). In group III, there was also a
decrease in NP-SH levels from before CR to during CR,
demonstrating that the allogeneic procedure triggered a
major imbalance in this antioxidant.
As demonstrated, CAT and SOD enzymatic antioxidants
were similar in the patient groups and control group
before the initiation of chemotherapy or radiochemother-
apy. SOD is the key enzyme required for the removal of
O2
•- by converting it to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which
can be eliminated by CAT and peroxidases. Catalase helps
in neutralizing the toxic effect of H2O2 converting it to
water and non-reactive oxygen species, thus it prevents the
generation of hydroxyl radicals and protects cells from
oxidative damage [48]. Our study demonstrated that after
the transplant, SOD and CAT activity were lower in both
groups II and III, when compared with the control group,
at different times, and also demonstrated a positive corre-
lation between these enzymes. This shows an imbalance
in enzymatic antioxidants caused by autologous and allo-
geneic procedures, which together with lipid peroxidation
indicates a state of oxidative stress in both situations.
Thus, it is plausible to suppose that oxidative stress can
exacerbate the complications in patients undergoing bone
marrow transplantation.
Blood δ-ALA-D activity before the CR in both patient
groups was similar to that of the control group and chem-
otherapy or radiochemotherapy (CR) led to a decrease in
δ-ALA-D activity over time in the patient groups. δ-ALA-D
is a zinc metalloenzyme, essential for all aerobic organ-
isms, that requires reduced thiol groups for its activity

[49]. Reactive oxygen species, produced during the CR [9-
12] can oxidize thiol groups located inside the active site
of mammalian δ-ALA-D [50,51], decreasing its activity as
observed here. In fact, the decrease in δ-ALA-D activity
after the CR was extremely accentuated and this occurred
in all patient groups, and δ-ALA-D also showed a signifi-
cant positive correlation with important antioxidants
such as VIT C, CAT, SOD and P-SH and a negative correla-
tion with TBARS, indicating that δ-ALA-D activity is a reli-
able marker for oxidative stress in BMT. Finally, δ-ALA-D
inhibition can result in ALA accumulation, which can
have pro-oxidant effects [52] and contribute to oxidative
stress caused by the CR and also by the bone marrow
transplantation itself. In fact, an increase of ALA is typi-
cally associated with porphyria, hereditary tyrosine and
lead poisoning and its accumulation causes oxidative
stress and may lead to cancer [53]. Thus, an inhibition of
δ-ALA-D after the CR may contribute to cancer relapse or
secondary malignancies that may arise after chemother-
apy [11]. However, a decrease in δ-ALA-D could be due to
the general decline of the heme route, which does not
implicate ALA accumulation. To answer this question, it is
necessary to study the activity of ALA-S (δ-aminolevulinic
acid synthase), the rate-limiting step of heme synthesis,
which could indicate whether there is, in fact, ALA accu-
mulation.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the results presented here indicate that
some patients undergoing BMT present signs of oxidative
stress even before transplantation, which are possibly a
consequence of their disease or previous procedures, as is
probably the case in autologous patients, which already
presented increased lipid peroxidation even before the
transplantation. However, in allogeneic patients this
increase occurred during the CR. We also observed that
the CR and the autologous or allogeneic transplantation
themseles promoted modifications in the levels of non-
enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidant defenses and in δ-
ALA-D activity. Moreover, blood δ-ALA-D activity seems
to be an additional biomarker of oxidative stress in BMT
patients.
