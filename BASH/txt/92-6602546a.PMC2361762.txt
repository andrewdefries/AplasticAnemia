Functionally active telomerase is affected at various steps including transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels of major telomerase
components (hTR and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)). We therefore developed a rapid and sensitive method to
quantify hTERT and its splicing variants as well as the hTR by a Taqman real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction to
determine whether their altered expression may contribute to telomere attrition in vivo or not. Fresh leukaemia cells obtained from
38 consecutive patients were used in this study. The enzymatic level of telomerase activity measured by TRAP assay was generally
associated with the copy numbers of full-length hTERT þ a þ b mRNA (P ¼ 0.0024), but did not correlate with hTR expression
(P ¼ 0.6753). In spite of high copy numbers of full-length hTERT mRNA, telomerase activity was low in some cases correlating with
low copy numbers of hTR, raising the possibility that alteration of the hTR : hTERT ratio may affect functionally active telomerase
activity in vivo. The spliced nonactive hTERT mRNA tends to be lower in patients with high telomerase activity, suggesting that this
epiphenomenon may play some role in telomerase regulation. An understanding of the complexities of telomerase gene regulation in
biologically heterogeneous leukaemia cells may offer new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of acute leukaemia.

Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is an essential
component of the holoenzyme complex that adds telomeric repeats
to the ends of chromosomes (Meyerson et al, 1997; Nakamura et al,
1997). The differential expression of telomerase in most malignant
cells makes it an attractive target for cancer therapy (Mokbel, 2003;
Shay and Wright, 2003); however, recent progress in studies on
telomerase regulation has shown that telomerase activation is
achieved by a process involving various steps including transcrip-
tional and post-transcriptional levels of hTERT gene (Kyo and
Inoue, 2002). An alternate splicing of hTERT transcript is one of
the regulatory mechanisms of telomerase activity (Ulaner et al,
1998). Several alternatively spliced variants of hTERT have been
identified (Kilian et al, 1997; Ulaner et al, 1998; Wick et al, 1999; Yi
et al, 2001); one deletion site induces the a-deletion variant,
lacking 36 bp from exon 6, and the other induces the b-deletion
variant, lacking 182 bp from exons 7 and 8 (Yi et al, 2001). More
recently, we have found a new alternatively spliced form, namely
the g-deletion variant, lacking the entire exon 11 (Hisatomi et al,
2003; Nagao et al, 2004). Since splicing variants are considered to
be nonfunctional forms, it is important to discriminate the full-
length isoform from variants (Yi et al, 2001).
Another essential element to control telomerase activity is the
RNA component of telomerase (hTR: human telomerase template
RNA) (Feng et al, 1995; Weinrich et al, 1997). Several lines of
evidence suggest the possibility that reprogramming of telomerase
by expression of mutant telomerase RNA would result in impaired
function of telomeres (Marusic et al, 1997). Indeed, germline
mutation hTR has been found in the autosomal dominant form of
congenital dyskeratosis (DKC) showing progressive telomere
shortening without functional telomerase activity (Mitchell et al,
1999; Vulliamy et al, 2001). More recently, it has been shown that
heterozygous telomerase RNA mutations found in DKC and
aplastic anaemia reduce telomerase activity via haploinsufficiency
(Marrone et al, 2004).
The aim of this study was therefore to clarify the quantitative
relationship between functionally active telomerase and its
components hTR and hTERT (and its spliced variants) using a
rapid and highly specific real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RT-Q-PCR) and gain greater insight into the complex
regulatory system of telomerase in acute leukaemia cells.

more than 90% blasts at diagnosis (8–68 years of age): 13 with
ALL-L2 and 25 with AML (M1, 6; M2, 14; M3, 2; M4, 2; and M5, 1).
De novo acute leukaemia was diagnosed according to the French–
American–British criteria. All of the ALL patients had precursor
B-cell phenotype, and no patient with T-cell ALL was included in
this study. Some of the clinical and molecular biological data
concerning these patients were reported elsewhere (Ohyashiki et al,
2001, 2002). All the samples of peripheral blood or bone marrow
cells were separated using a Ficoll–Hypaque gradient, then cell
pellets were immediately stored at À801C. All samples were
acquired after obtaining written informed consent from the
patients.
Quantification of telomerase activity
Telomerase activity was assessed by TRAP assay according to the
method of Kim et al and Piatyszak et al with minor modifications,
using an automated DNA sequencer (Ohyashiki et al, 1997). For
standardisation of telomerase activity, we used 10 ag of ITAS/
telomerase assay and the level of telomerase activity was arbitrary
expressed as the ratio of the TRAP ladder/ITAS per microgram of
protein as reported previously (Ohyashiki et al, 1997).
Real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction
of hTERT mRNA and hTR RNA
Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, MD,
USA). Total RNA (1 mg) was used for cDNA synthesis using a
Ready-To-Go You-Prime First-Strand Beads (Amersham Bios-
ciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and a pd(N)6 Random Hexamer
(Amersham Biosciences). Genomic organisation of the hTERT
gene and the location of Taqman primer–probe sets are shown in
Figure 1. We designed primers and probes to amplify specially
only one form of hTERT (Table 1). Primers and probe sets for hTR
are also described in Table 1. In order to generate a standard
curve, we constructed plasmids that contain each amplified
fragment using a pT7Blue T vector-2 kit (Novagen, Darmstadt,
Germany). The Taqman b-actin kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) was also used for normalisation of the amount of
cDNA used in each PCR. The resulting cDNA (4 ml) was used in
each RT–PCR, and then analysed by a 7000 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems). For Taqman assay, a 50 ml of PCR
sample contained Taqman universal master mix (Applied Biosys-
tems, Foster City, CA, USA), 3 pmol of each primer pairs and
5 pmol of the corresponding probes were used as recommended by
the manufacturer. The PCR conditions were 951C for 10 min,
followed by 55 cycles of 951C 10 s and 601C for 1 min. A serial
dilution of plasmids was used in each PCR cycle in separate tubes
and served as a standard curve. The amount of gene expression in
each sample was then expressed as copy numbers per microgram
of RNA with respect to the standard curve.
Mutation analysis of hTR
PCR-direct sequencing was carried out in order to exclude
mutation of the hTR gene (NT_005612.14). We designed two
pairs of primers to detect mutation of the hTR gene: hTR-1F
(7597157–7598138), 50
-CTCATGGCCGGAAATGGAAC and hTR-
1R (7597633–7597652), 50
-TCTTCCTGCGGCCTGAAAGG; amd
hTR-2F (7597864-7597842), 50
-GCCTTCCACCGTTCATTCTAGAG,
and hTR-2R (7597413–7597432), 50
-TTTGGAGGTGCCTTCA
CGTC. The PCR conditions were as follows: preheating at 951C
for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles 951C for 30 s, 641C for 30 s and
721C for 1 min, and a final extension 721C for 10 min. Reactions for
direct sequencing of the PCR product were performed with BigDye
Terminator ver3.1 (Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Freemont, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis
Analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA), correlation analysis,
linear regression, Student’s t-test and the Mann–Whitney U-test
were calculated using StatView (Brain Power Inc., Calabasas, CA,
USA) software for the Macintosh personal computer. Values of
Po0.05 indicate a statistically significant difference.
RESULTS
Validation of quantification system of hTERT, its spliced
forms and hTR
Taqman RT–PCR was validated using a plasmid that contained the
target sequence of full-length hTERT þ a þ b. There was a linear
correlation of full-length hTERT þ a þ b mRNA between 101
and
106
molecules. Similarly, a linear correlation was observed in each
splicing form of hTERT and hTR (data not shown).

and an a-del-F primer and b-del-R primer for hTERTÀaÀb. For all types
of hTERT mRNA, we uniformly used an ex6 probe. The a site causes a
30-base deletion resulting in a no-frameshift mutation, and the b splice
site results in a 182-base deletion resulting in a nonsense mutation. The size
of the PCR product produced by each primer set depends upon the
alternative splicing of the hTERT transcript in the sample.

Functionally active telomerase is associated with
full-length hTERT expression, but did not correlate
with hTR expression
In acute leukaemia cells, the relative telomerase activity measured
by TRAP assay is associated with the expression level of full-length
hTERT þ a þ b mRNA (P ¼ 0.0024) (Figure 2A). In contrast, there
was no correlation between telomerase activity and hTR expres-
sion (P ¼ 0.6753) (Figure 2B). Of note is that there are some
exceptional cases showing low telomerase activity despite high
copy numbers of hTERT þ a þ b (Figure 2A, arrow). We also
found two cases of AML showing high telomerase activity with
detectable but low copy numbers of hTERT þ a þ b (Figure 2A,
arrowhead).
There is some overlap between telomerase activity in leukaemia
cells and that in normal blood cells; therefore, we arbitrarily
separated acute leukaemia patients into two groups according to
the relative telomerase activity as reported previously (Ohyashiki
et al, 1997): one with high telomerase activity, equivalent to
immortal cells, relative telomerase value greater than 30 (Group-
H), and the other with low to moderate telomerase activity (Group-
L). The hTERT expression level is significantly high in Group-H
(P ¼ 0.0013) (Figure 3A), while association between telomerase
activity and hTR expression was not significant (Figure 3B). This
indicates that functionally active telomerase activity is generally
associated with hTERT expression, but in some cases the TERT
expression does not simply reflect the enzymatic activity.
Ratio of hTR and hTERT is critical to determine enzymatic
activity of telomerase
To address the question as to why some patients show low
telomerase activity despite high hTERT þ a þ b expression, we
next compared the ratio of hTR and hTERT. The Group-L patients

showed significantly lower copy numbers of hTR (P ¼ 0.0284), and
the hTR/hTERT ratio was significantly lower than those in Group-
H patients (P ¼ 0.0094) (Figure 4). This indicates the possibility
that the combination of full-length hTERT and hTR is necessary to
create a functionally active telomerase activity in leukaemia cells
in vivo. The quantitative relationships between functionally active
telomerase activity and its components are shown in Figure 5.
There was an obvious difference between patients with low
telomerase activity, despite high full-length hTERT expression
(UPN41, 40 and 44, Figure 5A–C, respectively) and patients with
high telomerase activity (UPN15, Figure 5D). We next analysed the
mutation of the hTR gene in three patients showing a marked
discrepancy between hTERT þ a þ b expression and telomerase
activity, in order to determine whether this phenomenon is related
to mutation of hTR. No case showed mutation of hTR gene within
the limit of our primers. This indicates that the discrepancy
between expression of full-length hTERT and functionally active
telomerase activity is possibly due to the quantity of hTR but not
to the gene structure of hTR.
Role of nonactive splicing forms of hTERT
To clarify whether the splicing mechanism of hTERT really affects
the level of functional telomerase activity or not, we next compared
the expression level of hTERT þ a þ b and three spliced forms of
hTERT. The expression level of full-length hTERT þ a þ b mRNA
was generally associated with levels of spliced variants
hTERT þ a–b (P ¼ 0.0434) (Figure 6B) and hTERTÀaÀb
(P ¼ 0.0084) (Figure 6C), while the relationship between the
expression level of full-length hTERT þ a þ b mRNA and those
of spliced variant hTERTÀa þ b was not statistically significant
(P ¼ 0.1109) (Figure 6A). The ratio of spliced form/full-length
hTERT þ a þ b mRNA varied, but tended to be higher in Group-L
patients compared to those in Group-H, although the difference
was not always statistically significant: hTERT þ aÀb/full-length
hTERT þ a þ b(P ¼ 0.101),hTERTÀa þ b/full-lengthhTERT þ a þ b
(P ¼ 0.048)(Figure6D)andhTERTÀaÀb/full-lengthhTERT þ a þ b
(P ¼ 0.201). This indicates that increase of nonfunctional splicing
form of hTERT may play some role in telomerase downregulation.
DISCUSSION
Telomerase and telomere length are two important markers that
are rapidly gaining importance as targets for cures of several age-
related diseases including cancer. We therefore sought to
determine whether therapeutic approaches to leukaemia targeting
telomerase should consider the quantitative relationship between
telomerase and its components or not. Acute leukaemia is
composed of a heterogeneous population in terms of cell lineage,
cell differentiation and proliferative potential. In the current study,
the level of telomerase activity and telomerase components
revealed considerable patient-to-patient variation; however, we
found telomerase activity is significantly associated with hTERT
expression in most patients but did not correlate with hTR
expression. We also found that in some cases telomerase activity
was low, despite high copy numbers of full-length hTERT mRNA
correlating with low copy numbers of hTR. This is of particular
interest given that hTR has now been shown to be limiting for
telomere homeostasis in vivo, as seen in DKC (Mitchell et al, 1999;
Vulliamy et al, 2001).
Recently, mutations of hTR have been reported in a subset of
aplastic anaemia (Vulliamy et al, 2002). Although it is still
controversial whether the genetic change of hTR sequence is
polymorphism or not (Wilson et al, 2003; Yamaguchi et al, 2003),
Ly et al (2003) demonstrated that naturally occurring hTR
sequence mutation polymorphism in such patients can inhibit
telomerase activity by disrupting critical structures within the hTR
core domain. Unlike DKC, neither mutation nor deletion of hTR
was detected in this study by direct sequencing. This suggests that
the amount of hTR is so low that as a result there is an excess of
unbound hTERT mRNA. Indeed, the expression level of hTR is
consistent in leukaemia cell lines showing high telomerase activity
(Yi et al, 2001). The mechanism of telomerase regulation in acute
leukaemia cell is likely to be different from those in DKC and bone
marrow failure syndrome; however, the ratio of hTR and hTERT
might play an important role to contribute functionally active
telomerase activity and telomere homeostasis in vivo, whether or
not mutated hTR affect telomerase activity via haploinsufficiency.
In the current study, we found two exceptional cases with high
telomerase activity despite low expression of hTERT; therefore, we
could not completely rule out the possibility that hTERT-
associated proteins such as heat-shock proteins may affect the
activity of the telomerase holoenzyme.
Alternative splicing machinery of hTERT is considered to be
tissue specific and to influence telomere lengths during human
development (Ulaner et al, 2001). It has been shown that hTERT
RNA alternative splicing mediates telomerase downregulation
induced by the G-quadruplex ligand 12459 (Gomez et al, 2004).

Telomerase regulation in acute leukaemia cells

However, the ratios of spliced nonactive forms and full-length
hTERT in primary acute leukaemia cells are highly varied. Of
note is that the ratio of splicing variants and full-length
hTERT is lower in patients with high telomerase activity (n ¼ 7)
than that in patients without high telomerase activity (n ¼ 31).
It is known that splicing variants lack the a site function
as a dominant-negative inhibitor of telomerase (Colgin et al,
2000; Yi et al, 2001). Although we could not show direct
evidence that the spliced inactive variant of hTERT downregulates
full-length wild-type hTERT, it is likely that splicing variant
mRNA is related with some regulatory mechanism in acute
leukaemia cells without exhibiting high telomerase activity. While,
the meaning of these epiphenomena is still uncertain, the
regulatory mechanism of telomerase in leukaemia cells with low
telomerase activity appears to be similar to that in normal counter
parts. Zaffaroni et al (2002) reported that alternative splicing
mechanisms of hTERT that regulate telomerase activity in normal
tissue might be lost during malignant transformation in breast
tumours. Taken together with Zaffaroni’s observation (2002), our
results suggest that acute leukaemia cells with high telomerase
activity might lose their regulatory mechanism during disease
progression.
Our findings suggest that the regulatory mechanisms in
leukaemia cells may be heterogeneous; therefore, the therapeutic
approach targeting telomerase should be considered based on the
quantitative relationship between telomerase and its components.
While the number of patients studied in the current study is
limited, our results suggest the necessity, and provide the basis, for
more detailed studies on the complex regulatory mechanism of
telomerase activity in haematologic neoplasia that may lead to the
development of new cancer therapeutic strategies.
