Abstract
Background: Genome-wide association studies have identified several genomic regions that are associated with
breast cancer risk, but these provide an explanation for only a small fraction of familial breast cancer aggregation.
Genotype by environment interactions may contribute further to such explanation, and may help to refine the
genomic regions of interest.
Methods: We examined genotypes for 4,988 SNPs, selected from recent genome-wide studies, and four
randomized hormonal and dietary interventions among 2,166 women who developed invasive breast cancer
during the intervention phase of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial (1993 to 2005), and one-to-one
matched controls. These SNPs derive from 3,224 genomic regions having pairwise squared correlation (r2
) between
adjacent regions less than 0.2. Breast cancer and SNP associations were identified using a test statistic that
combined evidence of overall association with evidence for SNPs by intervention interaction.
Results: The combined ‘main effect’ and interaction test led to a focus on two genomic regions, the fibroblast
growth factor receptor two (FGFR2) and the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S30 (MRPS30) regions. The ranking of
SNPs by significance level, based on this combined test, was rather different from that based on the main effect
alone, and drew attention to the vicinities of rs3750817 in FGFR2 and rs7705343 in MRPS30. Specifically, rs7705343
was included with several FGFR2 SNPs in a group of SNPs having an estimated false discovery rate < 0.05. In
further analyses, there were suggestions (nominal P < 0.05) that hormonal and dietary intervention hazard ratios
varied with the number of minor alleles of rs7705343.
Conclusions: Genotype by environment interaction information may help to define genomic regions relevant to
disease risk. Combined main effect and intervention interaction analyses raise novel hypotheses concerning the
MRPS30 genomic region and the effects of hormonal and dietary exposures on postmenopausal breast cancer risk.
Background
Genome-wide association studies have identified a sub-
stantial number of common genetic variants that are
associated with risk, for each of several diseases. How-
ever, most such associations are weak and account for
only a small fraction of familial disease aggregation [1].
In the case of breast cancer, seven reproducible genetic
susceptibility alleles were estimated to explain about 5%
of heritability [2]. Studies of low frequency genetic var-
iants, gene-gene interactions, genotype by environment
interaction, and shared environment have been sug-
gested [1] as means to identify the ‘missing heritability’
for complex diseases, along with more thorough study
of variants within genomic regions of interest.
Closely related to this is the role of genetic variants
in model discrimination and disease risk prediction. A
recent multiple-cohort analysis of ten common genetic
variants that reliably associate with breast cancer con-
cluded that ‘the level of predicted breast cancer risk
among most women changed little’ when these SNPs
were added to existing risk assessment models [3]. In
response, an accompanying editorial [4] pointed out
that cellular networks within which the SNPs operate
may associate more strongly with risk than do tagging
SNPs alone, that gene-gene and gene-environment

interactions are ‘likely to be profoundly important’, and
that associations with breast cancer subtypes may be
more impressive.
A challenge to pursuing the gene-environment con-
cept is the typical difficulty in assessing key environ-
mental exposures. For example, given the well-
established association between obesity and post-meno-
pausal breast cancer risk, one might expect that total
energy consumption and other dietary factors may influ-
ence breast cancer risk, possibly in a manner that
depends on genetic factors that relate to hormone meta-
bolism, growth factors, or inflammation. However, diet-
ary data are attended by random and systematic
assessment biases that may seriously attenuate and dis-
tort estimated associations [5].
Randomized controlled intervention trials can provide
highly desirable settings for the incorporation of geno-
type by environment interactions into genetic associa-
tion analyses. First, the intervention group assignment is
known with precision, and secondly, this assignment is
statistically independent of underlying genotype by vir-
tue of randomization. This latter feature also allows
highly efficient case-only test statistics [6-8] to be used
for genotype by intervention interaction testing.
The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) randomized
controlled trial included four randomized and controlled
comparisons among postmenopausal women in a partial
factorial design [9,10]. Specifically, it comprised a post-
menopausal hormone therapy component that involved
two non-overlapping trials: estrogen versus placebo (E-
alone trial) among women who were post-hysterectomy,
and estrogen plus progestin versus placebo (E+P trial)
among women with a uterus; a low-fat dietary modifica-
tion (DM) versus usual diet component, and a calcium
and vitamin D (CaD) versus placebo supplementation
component.
An elevation of breast cancer risk triggered the early
stopping of the E+P trial in 2002 [11,12]. In the E-alone
trial, which was stopped early in 2004 primarily due to
an elevation of stroke risk [13], there was a surprising
suggestion of a reduction in breast cancer risk in the
intervention group, as well as apparent interactions of
the E-alone hazard ratio with several other breast cancer
risk factors [14]. The DM trial continued to its planned
termination in 2005. While overall it provided non-sig-
nificant evidence of a breast cancer reduction over its
8.1-year average follow-up period, the breast cancer
hazard ratio was significantly lower in the quartile of
women who had a comparatively high fat content in
their diet at baseline [15]. These women made a larger
dietary change if assigned to the low-fat diet interven-
tion. The CaD trial did not yield evidence of an effect
on breast cancer risk [16].
We studied 4,988 SNPs in relation to breast cancer
incidence and clinical trials intervention effects during
the intervention phase of the WHI clinical trial.
Nearly all of these SNPs were selected as the top-
ranked SNPs according to significance level for asso-
ciation with breast cancer in the NCI Cancer Genetic
Markers of Susceptibility (C-GEMS) genome-wide
association study [17], while the remaining 244 were
selected based on published data from the Breast Can-
cer Association Consortium genome-wide association
study [18]. These SNPs were scattered throughout the
genome. In fact, they arise from 3,224 distinct loci
when a squared pairwise correlation (r2
) between adja-
cent regions of less than 0.2 is used to define new
loci. We ranked SNPs according to a null hypothesis
test that combined evidence of overall breast cancer
association with evidence of interaction with one or
more of the randomized clinical trial intervention
assignments.
Materials and methods
Study design and population
Enrollees in WHI trials were postmenopausal women
aged 50 to 79 years who met component-specific elig-
ibility criteria [19]. Women were randomized to a hor-
mone therapy component, or a DM component, or
both. At the one-year anniversary from enrollment, par-
ticipating women could be further randomized into a
CaD supplementation component. A total of 68,132
women were enrolled into the trials between 1993 and
1998, among which there were 10,739 in E-alone, 16,608
in E+P, 48,835 in DM, and 36,282 in CaD components.
Details about distributions of demographic variables and
breast cancer risk factors in the study cohort were pub-
lished previously [19]. For the DM trial we chose to
focus interaction testing on the subset of 12,208 women
having baseline percentage of energy from fat in the
upper quartile, and we denote the DM intervention in
this sub-cohort by DMQ.
Case and control selection
All 2,242 invasive breast cancer cases that developed
between randomization and the end of the trial inter-
vention phase (31 March 2005) were considered for
inclusion, among which a total of 2,166 (96.6%) cases
had adequate quantity and quality of DNA. This leads
to analyses based on 247 cases for E-alone, 471 cases for
E+P, 428 cases for DMQ, 1,049 cases for CaD (cases
arising after CaD randomization only), and correspond-
ing controls that were one-to-one matched to cases on
baseline age, self-reported ethnicity, participation in
each trial component, years since randomization, and
baseline hysterectomy status.

Laboratory methods
Genotyping and data cleaning methods at Perlegen
Sciences (Mountain View, CA, USA) have been
described [20]. The average call rate for these SNPs was
99.8%, and the average concordance rate for 157 blind
duplicate samples was also 99.8%.
Principal component analysis was used to characterize
population structure and to identify genotyping artifacts.
The top 20 principal components did not associate with
common sources of experimental variability (for exam-
ple, date of sample processing or hybridization perfor-
mance for either chip design). The first ten principal
components were found to account for 86% of the total
SNP genotype variation, while the first four principal
components provided good separation among the major
self-reported ‘ethnicities’ (white, black, Hispanic, Asian/
Pacific Islander, northern versus southern European
ancestry).
Statistical methods
A five-component test statistic was used for each SNP
to test association with breast cancer. The first ‘main
effect’ component arose as score test from a standard
logistic regression of case (1) versus control (0) status
on number of minor SNP alleles and potential con-
founding factors. The logistic regression model included
the (log transformed) Gail 5-year breast cancer risk
score [21], previous hormone use (indicators for < 5, 5
to 10, and ≥10 years for each of estrogen and estrogen
plus progestin), and (log transformed) body mass index.
Also included are variables used for matching controls
to cases in control selection. In addition, eigenvectors
from the first ten principal components from correlation
analysis of the genotype data were included to adjust for
population stratification [22]. The other four test statis-
tic components were case-only tests for dependence of
intervention odds ratios on SNP genotype for each of E-
alone, E+P, DMQ, and CaD. These statistics arise as
score tests in logistic regression of active (1) versus pla-
cebo or usual diet (0) randomization assignment on the
number of minor SNP alleles with logistic regression
location parameter offset by log q/(1 - q), where q is the
fraction of women assigned to active intervention for
the pertinent clinical trial component. The main effect
test statistic is asymptotically independent of each of the
case-only test statistics [23], and the interaction tests for
E-alone and E+P are independent since they are based
on non-overlapping sets of women. A ‘sandwich’ var-
iance estimator was used to allow for possible correla-
tions among the other pairs of case-only test statistics.
A chi-square test with five degrees of freedom was then
used to test SNP association with breast cancer, for each
of the SNPs. Further details about this joint test proce-
dure are included here as Additional file 1.
SNPs of interest in these association tests were subse-
quently examined for evidence of main effect and inter-
action effects separately. The latter once again employed
case-only analyses, and for descriptive purposes, inter-
vention odds ratios were estimated separately at zero,
one, and two minor SNP alleles. A likelihood ratio test
with two degrees of freedom assessed SNP by interven-
tion interaction in these analyses.
The potential of SNP by clinical trial interactions to
contribute to the ability to discriminate between breast
cancer cases and controls was evaluated by estimating
areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves
(AUC), and associated confidence intervals.
Some further analyses were carried out with breast
cancers classified according to either the estrogen recep-
tor status or the progesterone receptor status of the
breast tumor. All significance levels (P-values) are two-
sided.

Results
Simultaneous tests of main effect and interaction with
clinical trial interventions
Table 1 presents the top 20 SNPs ranked by P-value of
the combined test of main effect and interaction. Among
the 4,988 SNPs evaluated, six SNPs have the joint test P-
value less than 10-6
and a false discovery rate (FDR) less
than 0.0005, all in the FGFR2 (fibroblast growth factor
receptor 2) region in chromosome region 10q16. Imme-
diately following are several SNPs from the MRPS30
(mitochondrial ribosomal protein S30) region in chromo-
some region 5p12. Of these SNPs, rs7705343 is included
in the set of SNPs having FDR < 0.05, while close-by SNP
rs13159598 is also among SNPs having FDR < 0.10.
Table 1 also shows P-values and rankings for these
SNPs under the main effect association test alone.
While P-values for FGFR2 SNPs tend to be somewhat
diluted by the inclusion of the interaction information
in the test statistic, the ordering of these SNPs is rather
different under the two-testing procedures. For example,
SNP rs3750817, which is in a somewhat separate linkage
disequilibrium bin from tagging SNP rs2981582 [18],
has a comparatively higher ranking with the combined
test. We have previously reported suggestive evidence of
interaction of rs3750817 with E-alone and E+P [24], and
DMQ [25].

SNPs in the MRPS30 region of chromosome 5p12
have a higher ranking overall with the combined versus
the main effect test. Moreover, the ordering of SNPs
within this region is considerably altered by the inclu-
sion of the interaction information. These analyses point
to the genomic region in proximity of rs7705343 as rele-
vant to breast cancer risk. Figure 1 shows squared pair-
wise correlations (r2
) among SNPs in the MRPS30
region of chromosome 5p12. The combined test rank-
ings tend to decrease as one moves from rs7705343 to
the tagging SNP rs4415084 at the opposite end of this
genomic region of approximately 230 kb.
Table 2 shows P-values individually for the five com-
ponents of the combined test, for the eight SNPs in the
MRPS30 region. Most of the association information
derives from the main effect test, but the intervention
interaction tests have rather different P-values across
these SNPs, with rs7705343 having nominally significant
(P < 0.05) interactions with each of E-alone, DMQ, and
CaD, while interactions in relation to rs4415084 are not
significant for any of the interventions.
Table 3 shows estimated intervention odds ratios and
95% confidence intervals as a function of the number of
minor alleles of rs7705343 for each of the four interven-
tions. The GG genotype is associated with lower inter-
vention ORs for each of E-alone, DMQ, and CaD.
Additional file 2 provides corresponding information
with breast cancers classified according to estrogen
receptor or progesterone receptor positivity. No clear
variations by tumor receptor status were suggested,
through statistical power for detecting moderate varia-
tions with tumor type is limited.
The majority (86%) of the case-control samples are
from European-ancestry populations. In Additional files
3 and 4 we provide P-values for interaction between
trial components and SNPs in the MRPS30 region, and
the estimated intervention odds ratios and 95% confi-
dence intervals as a function of the number of minor
alleles of rs7705343 among women of European ancestry
specifically. The patterns that we observe are quite simi-
lar to the overall patterns.
We also examined the joint associations of these
FGFR2 and MRPS30 SNPs with hormonal and dietary
intervention effects, using case-only analysis. Based on
logistic regression applied to cases in DMQ, where the
indicator for active treatment is regressed on genotypes
of rs3750817 and rs7705343 together, both SNPs
showed nominally significant interactions. The P-values
for rs3750817 and rs7705343 were 0.0059 and 0.037.
When E-alone was similarly considered, rs3750817 and
rs7705343 had P-values of 0.053 and 0.043 in the joint
interaction model.
The AUC was calculated from logistic regression ana-
lyses that included clinical trial randomization

assignments for each of the four interventions and
potential confounding factors. This gave an AUC (95%
confidence interval) of 0.594 (0.578, 0.611). When main
effect indicator variables were added for one and two
minor alleles of rs3750817 and rs7705343, the AUC
increased to 0.610 (0.594, 0.627). When SNP by inter-
vention interaction indicator variables were also
included, the AUC increased further to 0.621 (0.604,
0.637). A bootstrap test of significance for the genotype
by intervention terms gave a nominal P-value of 0.007.
Discussion
We evaluated the association between 4,988 SNPs and
invasive breast cancer incidence in the WHI clinical trial
through the use of a statistic that combines SNP main
effect information with SNP by intervention interaction
information for each of four randomized interventions.
This view of the data provided a clear focus on two
genomic regions, the FGFR2 region of chromosome 10
q, which has a very strong main effect along with sug-
gestive evidence for interaction, and the MRPS30 region
of chromosome 5 p, which shows evidence of a com-
paratively smaller main effect and suggestive evidence
for interaction. The inclusion of the clinical trial inter-
ventions in this testing procedure leads to interest in
subregions containing FGFR2 SNP rs3750817 and
MRPS30 SNP rs7705343 that are some distance from
their associated tagging SNPs, possibly suggesting more
than one regulatory element in these non-coding geno-
mic regions.
We have previously [9,10] discussed these data in rela-
tion to FGFR2. The eight MRPS30 SNPs considered
here fall in a linkage disequilibrium region of approxi-
mately 230 kb from downstream of fibroblast growth
factor 10 (FGF10) to downstream of MRPS30, with a
minimum squared correlation among SNPs of 0.80 (Fig-
ure 1). FGF10/FGFR2 signaling [26-29] could be rele-
vant to these associations, though there is a
recombination hotspot between the FGF10 gene and the
5p12 SNPs studied here.
Our analyses suggest that interactions of these two
SNPs with WHI clinical trial interventions lead to a
detectable increase in the ability to distinguish breast
cancer cases from controls. Note, however, that AUC
values in this context may be optimistic in view of our
procedure for identifying SNPs of interest. Moreover,
since the interactions identified in the study have yet to
be confirmed by replication studies, the increase in
AUC detected here is of exploratory nature as well. Also
note that AUCs estimated here tend to be somewhat
low due to age matching in the case-control sample.

When our combined test is separated into its constitu-
ents, one observes nominally significant evidence of
interaction of MRPS30 SNP rs7705343 with three of the
four WHI interventions. Given the manner in which we
ranked SNPs, these analyses (Tables 2 and 3) should be
regarded as exploratory and such interactions will need
to be confirmed separately. Unfortunately, other clinical
trial data are not available for this purpose, and confir-
mation in observational study settings will involve the
challenge of reliable ascertainment of the relevant hor-
monal or dietary exposures, and will need to be carried
out in a case-control rather than case-only model.
Hence, quite large numbers of cases and controls will be
needed, as may be accessible through cohort consortia.
It is interesting to see a significant interaction of
rs7705343 with E-alone with the estimated intervention
OR below 1.0 for the GG genotype, and an insignificant
interaction of rs7705343 with E+P with the estimated
intervention OR greater than 1 for the GG genotype.
Few interactions with study subject characteristics have
been suggested for E+P [12], with FGFR2 SNP
rs3750817 as a possible exception [24]. In contrast,
interactions with several subject characteristics have
been identified for E-alone, including family history of
breast cancer, benign breast disease [14], and again
FGFR2 SNP rs3750817 [24]. A possible explanation is
that the progestin in E+P tends to overwhelm the minor
variations in hormone therapy hazard ratios that would
otherwise occur, giving rise to a strong and fairly uni-
form risk elevation.
Study strengths include its nesting within the rando-
mized controlled WHI clinical trial, implying randomi-
zation assignments that are known and that are
statistically independent of genotype and the related
ability to use case-only analyses for intervention testing.
Other strengths of the study include the use of pre-diag-
nostic blood specimens, collected and stored according
to a standardized protocol, and quality-controlled SNP
genotyping.
A limitation of the study is that the average age at
enrollment was 63 years in the WHI controlled trials,
with many women well past menopause at enrollment.
We have reported, in combined clinical trials and obser-
vational studies analyses, higher breast cancer hazard
ratios for E+P and E-alone among women who first use
these preparations soon after the menopause, compared
to those using them later [30,31]. Hence, the magnitude
of the odds ratios shown here may be lower than would
apply to typical hormone therapy users.
Conclusions
Simultaneous consideration of overall association and
intervention interaction point to genomic regions in the
vicinity of FGFR2 and MRPS30 genes as relevant to
breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women.
Moreover, subregions that were not otherwise the focus
of interest, in the vicinity of SNPs rs3750817 and
rs7705343, were identified as worthy of further study by
virtue of suggestive interactions with hormonal and diet-
ary interventions. These analyses represent an early step
in assessing the role of genotype by ‘environment’ inter-
actions to help explain familial breast cancer patterns,
or as a contributor to risk discrimination.
