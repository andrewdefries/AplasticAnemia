The residue of antibiotic chloramphenicol (CAP) is important issue for food quality control and also for the environmental
monitoring. It is banned for use in food-producing animals and has very limited use in human medicine, because of its severe
impact on human health. Determination of trace level of CAP in environmental samples requires a very sensitive analytical method
and eﬃcient preconcentration procedure. CAP can be eﬃciently preconcentrated in ﬂow-injection system using ﬂow-through
reactor packed with molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP), but determination of CAP in eluate from MIP requires the application
of chromatographic separation, which was made in reversed-phase HPLC system with UV detection. In optimized conditions the
limit of detection for 100 mL sample in HPLC with oﬄine preconcentration on MIP was evaluated as 0.66 mg/L. In hyphenated
FIA-HPLC system with zone sampling the LOD for developed method was evaluated as 15 ng/L, which indicates the possibility of
using it for analysis of environmental samples.
1. Introduction
The occurrence and impacts of various pharmaceuticals
applied for human and veterinary use in the environment are
emerging environmental issues in recent years. The presence
of pharmaceuticals in the environment generally results from
human and veterinary excretion of unmetabolized drugs
passing into sewage systems and subsequent discharge of
sewage eﬄuents. Among variety of pharmaceuticals, the
antibiotics are of special importance due to their extensive
use in human therapy and veterinary medicine, as well as
in promoting the growth of animals in livestock production
[1–5].
Chloramphenicol (CAP) (2,2-dichloro-N-[(1R,2R)-2-
hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl) ethyl] acet-
amide) (see Scheme 1) is an antimicrobial agent with
restricted use, because it causes blood dyscresia and is
reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen [6].
Numerous case reports have shown leukemia to occur
after medical treatment for CAP-induced aplastic anemia.
Several studies show that its metabolite dehydrochloroam-
phenicol may be responsible for DNA damage [7], so CAP
appears to be a gene toxin. CAP has been used since the
1950s to combat a wide range of microbial infections. It has
been also used in veterinary medicine as a highly eﬀective and
well-tolerated broad-spectrum antibiotic. It can be detected
in blood serum, plasma, cerebrospinal ﬂuid and urine. It
can be released to environment and found in various waste
streams. Half-life of CAP in soil is 4.5 days, while in water
10–20 days depending on pH and temperature.
CAP has been completely banned for use in food-
producing animals in many countries including European
Union and USA, hence is treated as illegal antibiotic. A
minimum performance limit which is required for the
determination of CAP was set by EU at 0.3 μg/kg in all food
of animal origin.
The most common method for routine determination of
CAP is LC/MS, however usually in analysis of real samples
with complex matrices, it has to be accompanied with
cleanup step using most commonly solid-phase extraction.

Recently published papers reported development of methods
for determination of CAP, for example, in honey [8], sewage
treatment plants [9], in swine wastewater and environmental
water samples [10], and also in herbs and grass [11]. For CAP
determination the HPLC method with UV detection and SPE
on C18 column was employed [12], and also GC/MS method
[13]. Several ﬂow injection methods with amperometric
detection have been developed with various types of working
electrodes [14–16].
For the same purpose in recent years also numerous
immunochemical methods have been developed. Screening
and conﬁrmation in shrimp tissue samples using ELISA in
combination with GC/MS and LC/MS was reported [17].
The application of molecularly imprinted polymers
(MIP), laboratory-synthesized or commercially available, for
the improvement of selectivity and limits of detection in
the determination of CAP, can be a method competitive to
the use of immunosorbents for the same purposes. In the
way the MIP is used as packed bed in SPE cartridge as it
was reported for HPLC determinations with UV detection
[18, 19]. The MIP for CAP was also employed as a solid-
phase dispersion sorbent for the CAP determination in
ﬁsh tissues [20]. The commercial MIP in SPE cartridges
was used for LC/MS2 determinations [21, 22]. The ﬂow
through reactor packed with MIP beads was employed in
the CAP determination with voltammetric detection for
analysis of ophthalmic solutions and spiked milk samples
[23]. Two other particular applications of MIP for CAP were
reported in ﬂow injection analysis (FIA) with luminescence
detections. In ﬂuorescent competitive ﬂow through assay
the MIP was packed to the spectroﬂuorimetric cell and the
limit of detection (LOD) in such system was evaluated as
8 mg/L [24]. The FIA determination of CAP involving online
preconcentration was recently reported in microﬂuidic sys-
tem with chemiluminescence detection with unprecedented
LOD level 2.4 ng/L for analyses in 50 μL samples [25]. In
conventional FIA system with chemiluminescence detection
for 524 mL sample volume the LOD was evaluated as 30 μg/L
[26].
The aim of this work was to investigate the possibility of
application of commercial MIP preparation for CAP precon-
centration in dynamic FIA system. Carrying out this step in
ﬂow through reactor may oﬀer some advantages compared
to conventional SPE syringes, including the mechanization of
handling solutions, better control of eluent ﬂow through the
bed, and favorable elution in counter-ﬂow direction. In the
FIA system two diﬀerent detections were examined, namely,
spectrophotometric in UV range and amperometric. Due to
limited selectivity of MIP sorption and possible bleeding,
for the detection of CAP in eluate from the MIP bed the
HPLC with UV detection was also applied. The optimized
method was applied for CAP determination in spiked river
water samples.
2. Experimental
2.1. Instrumentation. Electrochemical measurements were
conducted on glassy carbon (3 mm diameter) working elec-
trode, Ag/AgCl was used as reference and platinum wire as
auxiliary electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements
were carried out with potentiostat CHI model 830B (CH
Instruments Inc., Austin, Tex, USA).
The ﬂow injection system with amperometric detection
consisted of Knauer HPLC Pump model 64 and Autolab
PGSTAT10 potentiostat (Eco Chemie, the Netherlands). The
UV detection was carried out using ﬂow detector Waters
2487 Dual λ Absorbance. Tygon silicone tubings of 1.42 mm
i.d. were used for pumping and PTFE tubing of 0.82 mm
i.d. for connections; both were obtained from Cole Parmer
(Chicago, Ill, USA). A two-position injection valve was
obtained from Rheodyne (type 7010) (Rohnert Park, CA,
USA). Injection loops of 100 μL (amperometric system)
and 20 μL (UV system) were used throughout experiments.
Manual solid-phase extraction procedure was carried out
on a Vac Elut 20 Extraction Manifold obtained from Varian
(Walnut Creek, Calif, USA).
Chromatographic determinations in oﬄine mode were
carried out using HPLC system HP Series II model 1090.
In FIA/HPLC hyphenated system with online sample
preconcentration the peristaltic pump Alitea model U1
(FIALab Inc., Wash, USA) was used and Knauer HPLC
62 chromatographic pump. The Agilent column Zorbax
Extended C-18 (4, 6×150 mm, 5 μm) was used for HPLC sep-
aration.
2.2. Chemicals. Chloramphenicol (CAP), graphite nano-
ﬁbers (95%), and Naﬁon solution were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Methanol of HPLC
grade used as eluent, was a product of Merck (Darmstadt,
Germany). Phosphoric acid 85% of analytical grade used
for preparation of carrier solution was from Chempur
(Piekary Slaskie, Poland). Solid sodium hydroxide used for
pH adjustment in preparation of phosphate buﬀer was from
POCh (Gliwice, Poland).
MIP columns containing 25 mg of polymeric bed were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (SupelMIP SPE, MIP Tech-
nologies, Supelco).
A 30 mg/L CAP stock solution was prepared every second
week by dissolving 0.015 g of compound in 500 mL deionized
water and stored in a refrigerator. Standard solutions were
prepared by suitable dilution of stock solution with water.
The ultrapure water was from a Milli-Q ultrapure water
puriﬁcation system (Millipore, Bedford, Mass, USA).

(2) and 20 days (3) after preparation of CAP solution.
2.3. Preparation of MIP Flow-through Reactor. The ﬂow
through reactor was prepared by slurry packing of MIP beads
from SupelMIP SPE commercial cartridges `a 25 mg. For
preparation of the reactor 100 mg of MIP bed prepared as
aqueous suspension was trickled through SPE tube (5 mm
i.d.) in vacuum ﬂow. Both outlets of reactor were plugged
with polypropylene frits in order to prevent beads from
washing out.
2.4. Procedures
2.4.1. Natural Sample Pretreatment. Samples of tap water
were collected from the local water-supply system. River
water was collected from Warsaw stretch of Vistula River. All
samples were stored in refrigerator until the time of analysis.
Prior to the preconcentration all samples were ﬁltered on
Whatman no. 42 ﬁlter papers.
2.4.2. Oﬄine Sample SPE Extraction on MIP Sorbent. Condi-
tioning of SPE cartridge was carried out by ﬂushing it 5 mL
methanol and 5 mL water, respectively. Afterwards aqueous
sample was preconcentrated and bed was dried for 1 min in
vacuum ﬂow. The bed was washed with 1 mL of methanol to
elute the analyte.
2.4.3. Online Sample Preconcentration in FIA/HPLC Hyphen-
ated System. The procedure is analogous to that one
mentioned above. Firstly, MIP ﬂow through reactor was
conditioned by pumping 5 mL of methanol and 5 mL of
water, respectively, with ﬂow rate 0.5 mL/min. Appropriate
sample volume was preconcentrated consecutively (in ﬂow
rate up to 1.9 mL/min). Elution of analyte was carried out by
pumping 1 mL of methanol through reactor with ﬂow rate of
0.5 mL/min.
2.4.4. Chromatographic Determinations in Oﬄine Mode.
Prior to the injection, 1 mL of preconcentrated methanolic
sample was diluted 3 : 2 with water.
3. Results and Discussion
Due to strong absorption of UV radiation and electroactvity
of chloramphenicol, in this study on development of FIA
systems for determination of trace level of CAP, the UV
absorbance and amperometric detections of CAP were
examined.
3.1. Amperometric Detection in FIA System. As it was men-
tioned already in Introduction, several reports were already
published on the application of amperometric detection
of CAP in FIA systems with diﬀerent working electrodes
[14–16]. The application of voltammetric detection with
the use of a cylindrical carbon ﬁber microelectrode as the
working electrode was also reported [23]. For a single-
run determination of CAP also a disposable electrochemical
sensor with a Naﬁon coated screen-printed carbon working
electrode was developed [27]. In each case the detection
of CAP for analytical purposes was based on the four-
electron irreversible reduction of nitro group of CAP to the
hydroxylamine derivative.
In this work as working electrode a conventional
glassy carbon (GC) disk electrode of 3.0 mm diameter was
employed. The cyclic voltammogram recorded for 0.5 mM
CAP solution in 0.1 M H3PO4 in potential range –0.8 to
+1.0 V is showed in Figure 1(a). It is in good agreement
with voltammogram recorded using screen-printed carbon
electrode for CAP in the same conditions [16], with cathodic
peak of reduction of nitro group at −0.45 V. This working
electrode was further employed in FIA measurements in
4 Journal of Automated Methods and Management in Chemistry
the single-line manifold, using large-volume wall-jet cell.
Based on recorded CV voltammograms and analogous mea-
surements in hydrodynamic conditions for amperometric
detection in ﬂow measurements the polarization potential
−0.45 V was selected. In order to reduce the noise amplitude
of baseline in determination of LOD the gravity ﬂow
was employed instead of the use of peristaltic pump. In
measurements with the use of 0.1 M phosphoric acid as
carrier solution and for 100 μL injection volume the LOD
value for S/N = 3 was evaluated as 71 μM. It is widely
documented [28], that in many cases the modiﬁcation of
working electrode surface with the layer of carbon nanotubes
(CNT) results in some electrocatalytic enhancement of the
signal magnitude, hence in this work the GC electrode
surface was covered with CNT by evaporation of suspension
of CNT in Naﬁon on the electrode surface. This modiﬁcation
resulted in drop of LOD value down to 47 μM. The obtained
LOD value is similar to that reported recently for detection of
CAP in FIA system with amperometric detection using gold
electrode with self-assembled monolayer of 2-mercapto-5-
methylbenzimidazole [14], but evidently poorer than those
reported earlier for screen-printed carbon-based electrodes
or boron-doped diamond electrode in FIA systems [15, 16,
27].
Although this detection was not further employed in this
work due to poor LOD value, it was used for determination
of stability of aqueous solutions of CAP. As it is showed in
CV voltammograms in Figure 1(b), the height of cathodic
peak for CAP is decreasing in time, what means the necessity
of the preparation of fresh CAP solutions daily prior to the
measurements.
3.2. UV Detection in FIA System. The liquid chromato-
graphic determinations of CAP with UV detection reported
in the literature were carried out at wavelengths 275–
279 nm [18–20], which was in good agreement with our
recorded spectrum for 3 mg/L aqueous solution of CAP,
where maximum of absorption was observed at 278 nm. This
wavelength was used in this work for detection in FIA system
with chromatographic detector Waters model 2487. The
FIA signals recorded for CAP solutions using 20 μL sample
volume are showed in Figure 2. The well-reproducible blank
signal (S in Figure 2) resulted from injection of carrier in
single manifold FIA system was taken into account in the
calculation of LOD, taking into account both average blank
signal value and its precision. For whole examined range
of CAP concentration up to 300 mg/L the linear calibration
plot was obtained with LOD 0.17 μM (54 μg/L). Because of
much lower LOD obtained for CAP determination further
measurements were carried out using UV detection.
3.3. Preconcentration of CAP on Molecularly Imprinted
Polymer Bed. The commercially available MIP from MIP
Technologies, which were designed for the chloramphenicol
determination was already applied in the form of SPE
cartridges, and it was employed for determination of CAP
in milk-based matrices [21], and also in urine, plasma and
honey [22] in LC/MS2 systems.

blank which results from injection of water.
One of the aims of this study was to examine, if
for detection of CAP preconcentrated on commercial MIP
the direct UV detection in simple FIA system can be
successfully applied. Already initial measurements with
25 mg MIP cartridges showed a very signiﬁcant bleeding
of MIP bed in sequential cycles of rinsing the sorbent
bed with deionized water and eluting with methanol. As
the ﬁrst step the MIP bed was conditioning according
to manufacturer recommendation, then 10 mL of distilled
water was aspirated through the sorbent bed using solid-
phase extraction vacuum manifold. After this, sorbent was
dried during 1 min and washed with 1 mL methanol. The
obtained eluate was evaporated in the argon stream and
reconstituted with 1 mL water. The 20 μL volume of obtained
aqueous solution was injected into FIA system with UV
detection. Figure 3 shows the FIA signal magnitude obtained
after 8 consecutive repetition of this procedure, showing the
evident presence of some components absorbing at 278 nm.
For the comparison, the dotted line in Figure 3 corresponds
to signal obtained after injection into the FIA system the
20 μL of standard 150 μg/L solution of CAP. This experiment
convincingly indicates, that direct UV detection in eluate
from the MIP bed without separation cannot be employed
for the quantitative determination of preconcentrated CAP.
The presence of other than CAP components eluted
from the MIP bed, in sequentially repeated blank procedure
of washing bed with water and eluting with methanol, is
conﬁrmed by recorded chromatograms shown in Figure 4.
It was obtained in HPLC system with C18 column and
water: methanol (50 : 50 v/v) eluent. The chromatogram a

with 1 mL methanol, in b—10 mL of 15 μg/L CAP standard
solution was loaded on the bed, and then washed with 1 mL
methanol, that means 10-fold preconcentration of analyte.
For comparison in c is shown chromatogram obtained for
150 μg/L CAP solution. It is evident that component(s)
eluted as peak 1 on chromatograms will interfere in direct

CAP in methanol.
detection of the eluate in the CAP determination hence the
application of separation method for analysis of eluate from
the MIP bed is indispensable.
For further HPLC determination of CAP in eluates
from the MIP bed, the eﬀect of diﬀerent solvents used
for reconstitution of the CAP eluted with methanol was
examined, because as it is illustrated by chromatograms
showed in Figure 5, the use of pure methanolic solutions
causes some distortion of the signal shape by frontal peak
broadening. This eﬀect can be slightly reduced by the
decrease of injected sample volume. It can be fully removed
by the using of the HPLC eluent for reconstitution of
evaporated elate from MIP bed. It was also observed that
increase of the methanol content from 50 to 90% in injected
CAP solutions in HPLC determination results additionally in
about 20% decrease of the peak area. In optimized conditions
for the determination of CAP using standard solutions, with
injection sample volume 20 μL, a linear calibration plot peak
area vs. CAP concentration in whole examined range up to
600 μg/L was observed. The LOD for S/N = 3 was evaluated
as 51 μg/L.
In preconcentration of CAP from aqueous standard
solutions using SPE cartridge with MIP, it was found that
for the same amount of CAP 0.5 nanomole dissolved in
diﬀerent volumes ranging from 10 to 250 mL, which was
then loaded to the MIP bed with the same ﬂow rate,
a diﬀerent recovery was obtained. This was observed for
the same elution conditions, ranging from the complete
recovery for 10 mL (recommended volume of eluent by the
manufacturer), to about 60% recovery for initial sample
volume 250 mL. Concentration of the CAP in the solution,
which was loaded onto MIP bed were in the range from
0.6 to 15 μg/L. This can be attributed to slow kinetics of the
sorption, important especially at low concentration level of
analyte.

on in hyphenated FIA-HPLC system. For this purpose
the ﬂow through reactor was prepared using 100 mg of
beads taken from commercial MIP cartridges and packing
them into the polypropylene tube of inner diameter 5 mm.

ranging from 0.6 to 60 μg/L, and the loaded volume from
10 to 500 mL. The analyte retained on the MIP beads
was eluted with methanol in counter-ﬂow mode to sample
loading. The obtained results showed in Table 1 indicate
satisfactory recovery in optimized conditions up to initial
sample volume loaded to the sorbent bed 250 mL. This
indicates the possibility of obtaining enrichment factor
about 250, which is of a primary importance for the CAP
determination in trace level in environmental samples. The
chromatogram recorded for standard 1.0 μg/L CAP solution
preconcentrated from 100 mL sample is shown in Figure
6(b) (curve 1). In these conditions, taking into account the
amplitude of the baseline noise (N) the LOD for S/N = 3
was determined as 0.66 μg/L, while the limit of quantitation
(LOQ) for S/N = 10 as 2.2 μg/L.
3.4. CAP Determination in Natural Water Samples. In spite of
numerous restrictions in use of chloramphenicol in human
and veterinary medicine, in numerous studies its presence
was found in natural waters and wastes. Its content in ground
water and lake water from Hubei province in China was
found about 2 ng/L [10], while in water from river Han in
Korea 31 ng/L [29]. Much higher level, incidentally up to
1.5 μg/L was found in eﬄuent from industrial installation for
treatment of dairy wastewater [30]. The maximum CAP level
in sewage treatment plant eﬄuents was reported as 0.56 μg/L
[31], while in sewage treatment plants in China, in inﬂuent
31 ± 16, and in eﬄuent 17 ± 10 ng/L [9].
In analyses of environmental samples for the deter-
mination of trace analytes, the challenging task is not
only the developing of suﬃciently sensitive method, but
also optimizing whole analytical procedure in order to
eliminate interferences from matrix components. The sorp-
tion processes observed in molecularly imprinted polymers
include not only selective binding of target analyte in
cavity of polymer produced by employed template, but also
nonspeciﬁc sorption of matrix components, for example,
by hydrophobic interactions with polymer matrix, which
are strengthened in aqueous conditions [32]. As it was
demonstrated above, the application of direct UV detection
of CAP in the eluate from MIP bed is not possible due
to washing out of the sorbent beads some other not-
identiﬁed, as yet, components than CAP. Therefore, it is
necessary to apply some separation method, for example, as
HPLC in this study, which can additionally separate target
analyte CAP in eluates from MIP-based preconcentration
of analyte from complex matrices. This is well illustrated
by example chromatograms showed in Figure 6 for natural
water samples. In both samples of tap and river water, in
dead-volume of HPLC chromatograms a large absorbance
is observed, that can be attributed to the presence of
other organic components retained on MIP bed during
the preconcentration run. There are also, especially in river
water sample, numerous components eluted with particular
retention time. The spiking of analyzed samples with CAP
at 1 μg/L level, illustrates the potential of this method for
real analytical application. It seems that for instance for
analysis of river water samples, a further optimization of
HPLC separation should be made for better separation of
signal for CAP from partly overlapped signal with retention
time 3.50 min.
As it showed in Table 2, the recovery of CAP deter-
mination is slightly aﬀected by matrix components in
natural waters, compared to aqueous CAP standards, but for
100 mL sample volume, giving enrichment factor 100, the
obtained recovery above 92% can be considered as satisfac-
tory.
3.5. Hyphenated FIA-HPLC System. The schematic of the
ﬁnal setup for this study with hyphenation of ﬂow injection
preconcentration with HPLC analysis is showed in Figure 7.
The crucial factor in optimization of functioning of this
system is to ﬁnd the most favorable time delay for injection
of 20 μL sample with chromatographic injection valve since
starting elution from MIP column. In order to do this, the
concentration proﬁle of eluted sample was recorded. The
experimental data for this plot were obtained by sampling
a 20 μL volume from eluted 1 mL methanolic solution from
MIP column every 30 s since the elution from the MIP
column has started, and injecting this into HPLC setup. The
obtained proﬁle is showed in Figure 8(a). The maximum
concentration in dispersed zone of 1 mL methanolic eluent
was observed in sample segment taken after 775 s, and this
time delay was employed for measurements in hyphenated
systems.
As one can expect this zone re-sampling step allows the
injection of a much more concentrated sample than average
concentration in whole volume of 1 mL methanolic eluent
used for injection in oﬄine mode measurement. Based on
chromatographic signal recorded for 30 μg/L CAP solution
(Figure 8(b)), based on the peak-height for S/N = 3, the
limit of detection was evaluated as 0.15 μg/L. This was

earlier 100 times enrichment the LOD value will be 15 ng/L,
which seems to be satisfactory for analysis of environmental
samples.
4. Conclusions
The determination of pharmaceutical residues in environ-
mental and food samples is a challenging task in modern
analysis. It is due to their ultra trace level and from other

point of view of signiﬁcant possible toxic and mutagenic
eﬀects for higher organisms, including humans. They require
usually preconcentration of trace analyte and cleanup sam-
ples with complex matrices, what most commonly is carried
out with solid-phase extraction methods.
A signiﬁcant improvement in SPE sample treatment is
carrying it out in ﬂow injection systems, which simpliﬁes
the manipulation with solutions in diﬀerent stages of whole
procedure, and can then be utilized in design of mech-
anized or automated measuring systems. The application
of MIP in SPE allows the obtaining certain selectivity of
preconcentration process, but in complex matrices, as it
was shown for determination of chloramphenicol in spiked

natural waters, this selectivity is not suﬃcient for application
of simple ﬂow detection without separation of components
of eluates from MIP reactor. The obtained sub-μg/L LOD
level indicates a potential possibility of application of devel-
oped method for CAP monitoring in heavy-loaded industrial
and agricultural wastes for environmental protection. In the
hyphenated FIA-HPLC system where additionally zone re-
sampling can be employed, using 100 times enrichment
on MIP column, the limit of detection was evaluated as
15 ng/L, which makes the developed method suitable for
determinations of CAP in waters.
For the comparison of the developed method with
methods reported earlier in the literature, the limits of
detection are listed in Table 3. The developed method
exhibits the best LOD value among other ﬂow methods with
diﬀerent detections, and better values of LOD were reported
only for sophisticated capillary electrophoretic method
with LIF detection [34], and also one of reported surface
plasmon resonance method [37]. Table 3 does not include
applications of LC/MS methods in food and biological
material analysis, where LOD values are evaluated in terms
of content of CAP in analyzed material. Based on recent
review [38] one can expect the possibility of application of
developed method also for determination of CAP in biologicl
samples.
