Historical and Modern Epidemiological
Studies on Populations Exposed to
NmSubstituted Aryl Compounds
by R. A. Cartwright*
The historical exposures to aromatic amines of various occupational groups are briefly reviewed.
Modern studies indicate that other occupational groups might have risks worth investigating; these
include machinists and workers in the chemical industry. Details of a recent investigation into the
exposure of dye workers are given which indicate a lowered risk in recent years since the introduc-
tion of safety measures. Nonoccupational exposures to the aromatic amines are also discussed. They
include cigarette smoking and phenacetin abuse, the former being a potent causal agent in bladder
cancer.
Introduction
The history of human exposure to aromatic
amines probably starts with the observations of
Rehn (1) of German aniline dye workers. He ob-
served four cases of bladder cancer out of a proba-
ble total of 500 workers employed in the plant at
that time. These observations sparked off a huge
controversy over the next 30 years which had
several significant consequences. The attempts to
understand what hazards existed in industrial situa-
tions led to the development of some of the tech-
niques of modern epidemiology, in particular the co-
hort or follow-up study. The observation not only
drew attention to bladder disease at that time, it en-
sured that bladder cancer would be studied almost
to the exclusion of all other diseases in industrial
situations. This is almost as true today as 40 years
ago, in part due to the more recent use of the case-
control approach. Finally, and most importantly, it
led to the development of laboratory analyses which
demonstrated the biochemistry of causal association
and which, along with the epidemiological results
led to the demise of those industrialists who claim-
ed the associations were fortuitous.
The early history of industrial aromatic amine ex-
posure was one of claim and counterclaim: first,
about the nature of the excess numbers of bladder
cancer cases; second, about which chemicals were

tal, Leeds 16, England.
implicated; and finally about the natural history of
"industrial" bladder cancer as contrasted with other
types. The controversy over the existence of exces-
sive bladder cancer cases was finally resolved by
Case et al. (2, 3), who also contributed to the identifi-
cation of some of the carcinogenic chemicals. The as-
sertions that "industrial" bladder cancer is a more
aggressive disease has yet to be fully resolved, al-
though some evidence for this is now forthcoming
(4).
The Dye Manufacturing Industry
Case (5, 6) computed the number of male bladder
cancer deaths between 1921 and 1951 among a
group of workers from dye manufacturing compa-
nies and contrasted this with male deaths due to
bladder cancer from the totality of England and
Wales. He expected, on this basis, four bladder can-
cer deaths and found 127 in the dye industry. In ad-
dition the records were such that it was possible to
estimate the exposure to several suspect sub-
stances. They showed that 25% of all the men ex-
posed to aromatic amines, including benzidine and 2-
naphthylamine, developed bladder cancer. Those
men only exposed to benzidine in fact had fewer
tumors (15%) and those only exposed to 2-naphthyl-
amine had more (50%). The few individuals who dis-
tilled 2-naphthylamine all died of bladder cancer.
Case (6) also showed that the deaths occurred
earlier among dye workers than the general popula-
tion, having excessive occurrences under the age of
R. A. CARTWRIGHT
65. He also computed a median latent period from
first exposure of eighteen years; the range, how-
ever, is between 5 and 63 years (7). Case estimated
in 1952 that of the workmen exposed to aromatic
amines between 1921 and 1952, another 243 cases
would accrue in the U.K., even if all exposure were
withdrawn at that time due to the latency of the
disease. Table 1 shows the distribution of this risk.
Case's estimates have unfortunately proved, by
1982, to be too low. Work by Scott (8) indicated that
1-naphthylamine was also a suspect chemical, al-
though this is possibly erroneous due to mixed ex-
posures with 2-naphthylamine.
Rubber and Cable-Making
Industries
Case and Hosker (9) investigated the rubber in-
dustry in the early 1950s and found an excessive
number of bladder cancer deaths. This resulted in a
standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 164 for blad-
der cancer. Since then exhaustive studies have been
undertaken which indicate that the risk of bladder
cancer in these industries is largely historical al-
though still high in a few occupational subgroups
due, once more, to the long latent period. In addi-
tion to bladder cancer, both lung and stomach can-
cers were excessively high in rubber industry
workers.
The bladder cancer risk has been ascribed to the
contamination of the various rubber antioxidants by
naphthylamine isomers. The picture is more com-
plex than that, however, due to the numerous other
chemicals, such as reinforcing agents and organic
accelerators, added to rubber in its manufacture.
In addition, due to the differences in industrial
practices in the United States, where 4-aminobi-
phenyl was used, U.S. workers had a lower risk of
bladder cancer than British workers. As in the U.K.,
the U.S. risks now seem historical, and once more
excesses of other tumors have been observed
among exposed workers, including lung cancers,
stomach cancers and leukemias. The significance of
these observations has always been in doubt due to
the wide variety of chemicals used in the rubber in-
dustry and the weak statistical associations. The
same complex picture is seen in the rubber cable-
making industry although, once more, an excess of
bladder tumors did once exist (10).
Gas Workers
Workers engaged in the production of coal gas
were shown by Doll et al. (11) to have slight excess
of bladder cancer and larger excesses of lung cancer
and of chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic
bronchitis. As aromatic amines constitute only a
small part of the inhaled gases in such establish-
ments, the significance of these results remains in
some doubt. In addition, due to natural gas, this in-
dustry has disappeared from most European coun-
tries, and no work has been undertaken on this
topic recently.
The Regulations
The studies referred to so far represent the clas-
sical work on aromatic amine exposure to industrial
groups. The controlling regulations used in the
U.K., the Carcinogenic Substances Regulations, are
based upon them as well as the current clinical sup-
positions about bladder cancer etiology existing at
that time. The controlled or prohibited substances
are: o-naphthylamine, (3-naphthylamine, dichlor-
obenzidine, 4-aminodiphenyl, auramine and magen-
ta, o-dianisidine and o-tolidine. These regulations
are still current in the U.K. more or less in their
original form. In addition there are a group of occu-
pations "recognized" as hazardous for compensation
purposed in the U.K. These are: the chemical dye
manufacturing industry and other branches of the
industry handling the recognized substances, gas
workers, laboratory workers, manufacture of rub-
ber-coated cables, paint and pigment manufacturers,
rodent controllers, rubber manufacturers and tex-
tile printers. Some groups, such as the rat catchers,
have never been shown to be at risk; their inclusion
is due to their use of a-naphtholthiourea (ANTU).
Naphthylamine manufacture ceased by 1953 in
the U.K. and benzidine production disappeared by
1962. These chemicals are made in other parts of
the world in a variety of plants-some automated
without human exposure and some, sadly-in the

developing world- with old-fashioned techniques
leading to excessive human exposure.
Modern Industrial Studies
Very few follow-up studies have added substan-
tially to our knowledge of the processes or hazards
to humans of aromatic amine exposure since the
1960s. One such study, however, on a modern Ger-
man auramine plant has indicated little risk to the
work force there (12), contrary to the earlier work
of Case (3).
Most studies have addressed the question: are
aromatic amines found in other industrial or nonin-
dustrial environmental situations, and do they cause
an excessive number of bladder cancers as a result?

variety of these studies. Table 2 ignores the tradi-
tional occupations. These studies present a confus-
ing array of results, which contain some explicable
occupations such as the kimono painters and lea-
therworkers who used benzidine-based dyes. In ad-
dition, some textile workers, paint manufacturers
and hairdressers could also have contact with dan-
gerous coloring agents. It is also conceivable that
metal workers might have contact with aromatic
amines from fluxes or as partly combusted sub-
stances from furnaces, although no conclusive hy-
giene work has been undertaken on this topic
among these groups. Other groups with excessive
numbers of bladder cancers, including, sailors, coal
miners and clerical workers, are difficult to assess
as to their possible exposure to occupational aro-
matic amines. Possibly other factors of a nonoccupa-
tional nature are involved in these instances or
these are fortuitous observations thrown up by the
multiple comparisons made by the case-control anal-
ysis techniques. More credance might be accorded
these observations if other studies confirmed the as-
sociations.
West Yorkshire Bladder Cancer
Studies
The author has recently completed a case-control
study of occupational exposure and bladder cancer
in West Yorkshire. Analyses so far incorporate re-
sults on 1259 cases and 1981 controls from specific
areas in Yorkshire. Table 3 gives overall results for
a few occupational groups. Clerical workers have a
low but statistically significant risk, as do cooks, ma-
chinists and woodworkers. Machinists are a large
group of workers in this area, and although the risk
is quite low, the population attributable risk will be
high. Further analyses are underway among ma-
chinists. There is evidence that some of the mineral
oils used by the lathe operators contains aromatic
amines as emulsifiers and corrosion inhibitors.

West Yorkshire also contains a large number of
aromatic amine-exposed dye manufacturing process
workers. Results on these groups are given in Table
4 and show that the risk of bladder cancer is still
high, despite controlling measures dating back 30
years. However, the risk is largely historical, as
shown in Table 5, which indicates that dye workers
subdivided by year of starting work, have a greatly
reduced (and statistically insignificant) risk of devel-
oping bladder cancer when first exposed after 1952.
Table 6 indicates that the length of exposure to
these substances is also important: exposure of less
than 10 years results in a much smaller risk, even
prior to 1940 when precautionary working practices
were nonexistent. Undoubtedly the cases presented
in recent years are a somewhat biased group, be-
cause those heavily exposed for short periods could
have died of the disease prior to the start of our
study and other cases could arise in the future hav-
ing been exposed many years previously.
These data need careful analysis prior to full
presentation, but two further studies have resulted:
a detailed analysis of those exposed to machine oils
and a new cohort study in the chemical industry in
a plant manufacturing 4,4'-methylenebis(2-chlorani-
line) (MBOCA), used as a hardener for plastics. This
plant has had 13 new cases of bladder cancer in the
last few years-far more than that which might be
expected. It is possible that this substance, or its
manufacture, is carcinogenic to men. Some work has
been recently completed on anthraquinone exposure
in a factory in Scotland; the results indicate no ex-
cessive risk to the work force. With these few ex-
ceptions many aromatic amines have had little epi-
demiological attentions. Table 7 summarizes what
human evidence of aromatic amine contact that is
available and allows some conclusions to be made.
Table 8 lists some of those chemicals for which data
are completely absent.
Nonoccupational Exposure to
Aromatic Amines
Cigarette smoke contains aromatic amines along
with many other compounds, and, although it is not
possible to be absolutely confident of the chemical
nature of the association, there is no doubt that cig-
arette smoking produces an excess of bladder tu-
mors. Table 9 is taken from Wynder (29) and gives
the risk for males for broad categories of smokers
and nonsmokers. Recent results from Yorkshire are
included. The studies vary in both case and control
ascertainment, as well as conduct and study analy-
sis. It is difficult to summarize these results except
to say moderate to heavy cigarette consumption
doubles the risk of bladder cancer. Most results
from females show a slightly lower risk than the
comparable male result.
Phenacetin ingestion over long periods or in
quantities over 1 g/day for at least a year (30) leads
to renal papillary necrosis and to tumors of the uro-
thelium of the renal pelvis. Over 100 cases have
been reported, largely from Scandenavia, where
such abuse was not uncommon. Transitional cell
tumors of the renal pelvis are excessively rare in
the U.K., however. In a series of all urothelial tum-
ors in Yorkshire, 2.4% proved to be arising in the
renal pelvis. One out of 15 of these cases proved to
have been a chronic phenacetin taker. This suggests
the problem is not a serious one in the U.K., al-
though tumors still occur due to this reason.
It has been recently suggested, however, that tu-
mors lower down the renal tract, in the ureter and
bladder, may also result from phenacetin abuse. A

thylamine is a now defunct agent once used in the
treatment of a variety of malignancies including
Hodgkin's disease, some leukemias, and polycy-
themia rubra versa. Videbaek (32) and Thiede et al.
(33) reported excessive numbers of bladder cancers
arising in these patients, and there is no doubt this
was due to the administration of this particular drug
(27).
There may well be many other aspects of human
nonoccupational exposure to aromatic amines
through a wide variety of agencies: food colorants,
or oils, for example. There are few practical situa-
tions where epidemiological studies would result in
useful and clear answers. One exception to this has
recently come to light in England, and it helps to Il-
lustrate that a careful watch of our environment is
still required.
The example concerns coarse fishermen-a very
popular sport in the U.K. with over 4 million reg-
ular participants. Anecdotal accounts led to a
17
18 R. A. CARTWRIGHT
chemist investigating the activities of these men,
only to find that they commonly used maggots of
the blue-bottle flies as hooked and ground bait. This
practice is innocuous, except the majority of keen
fishermen stain their maggots. The stains used are:
Chrysoidine y (2,4-diaminoazobenzene), Rhodamine,
Auramine 0, Methylene Blue and Bismark Brown.
The most popular is the bronze-staining Chrysoidine
or Basic Orange 2, whose active constituent is 1,2,4-
triaminobenzene (34). These substances are used in
powder form by fishermen and are readily available
over the counter in England. The fishermen stain
their fingers, put maggots in their mouths and have
every opportunity to absorb these dyes. We are ac-
tively investigating the possibility that these fisher-
men might have excessive rates of bladder cancer.
These observations could be of great significance,
because industrially based epidemiological studies
on azo dye workers can produce confused results
due to mixed exposures, while fisherman have had
much simpler and easily extractable exposures.
Conclusion
There is strong human evidence for the associa-
tion of bladder and renal pelvis cancers with specific
aromatic amines. There is weaker evidence that
stomach and lung cancer are found in excess in
those exposed to particular amines. In addition the
effects of human exposure on a large range of com-
pounds is unknown.
It should be remembered, however, that there is
little or no evidence to incriminate some aromatic
amines, auramine and aniline, for example. It is
likely that many aromatic amines in their pure state
present little or no hazard to humans, but this re-
mains to be demonstrated when appropriate epide-
miological situations arise.
I would like to acknowledge the help of Professor Don
Acheson and Mr. B. Pannett in drawing my attention to the
potential hazards in some mineral oils and the MRC for fund-
ing the West Yorkshire Bladder Cancer project.
