Abstract
Introduction: There has been a recent increase in the incidence of myositis worldwide. To this
date, myositis has been described almost exclusively in children and adolescents. In most cases the
causative agents are Gram-positive bacteria. When it involves muscles around the hip, other
differential diagnoses such as septic arthritis and transient synovitis need to be excluded amongst
others.
Case presentation: We present the case of a 16 year old Caucasian male who suffered from
pyomyositis of his left obturator internus muscle. He was pyrexial at 41°C with rigors and severe hip
pain, whilst range of motion of his left hip was severely limited. Tenderness over the left pubic bone
was significant. After clinical examination and relevant laboratory investigations, it was decided to
treat him conservatively with intravenous antibiotics. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus
resistant to amoxicillin and ampicillin. The patient was discharged fifteen days later. At the time of
discharge, he was symptom-free.
Conclusion: This form of pyomyositis is a rare pyogenic infection, which may be difficult to diagnose
and can easily be missed. Therefore, physicians should familiarise themselves with this condition and
consider it as a possible differential diagnosis in patients presenting with an acutely painful hip.
Introduction
Patients who present with pyrexia and an acutely painful
hip require an urgent orthopaedic opinion. Early exclusion
of bacterial septic arthritis is essential, as the consequences
of delay may prove potentially devastating for the joint.
If evaluation rules out the presence of septic arthritis,
other conditions such as toxic synovitis, osteomyelitis,
discitis, pyomyositis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and
malignancy should be considered.
Pyomyositis is a primary bacterial infection of skeletal
muscle. Initially, it was considered to be a disease of the
tropics. However, pyomyositis has become more frequent
among both children and adults in temperate climates as

well [1]. Although it predominantly affects muscles of the
lower limb, it may also involve muscles of the upper limb,
trunk and spine. In the lower limb, the most commonly
affected muscles are the quadriceps and iliopsoas followed
by the gluteal muscles [2]. More rarely, it can involve the
obturator internus (OIM) and/or externus muscles [3].
Lack of familiarity with the condition frequently leads to
a delayed diagnosis [3,4]. We report herein a case of a
16 year old male with pyomyositis of the OIM.
Case presentation
A 16-year-old Caucasian male presented to our emergency
department complaining of acute onset of left hip pain
and was unable to weight bear. He had been pyrexial at
37.6°C for the last 2 days. He described the pain as sharp
and constant, located in the left groin and radiating down
to the anterolateral aspect of his ipsilateral thigh. It was
aggravated by movement. There were no associated
abdominal or urinary symptoms. There was no history
of trauma, recent illness or foreign travel. There was no
relevant past medical history of any note.
On clinical examination, the patient was pyrexial at 38.9°
C. His position of comfort was with the hip in flexion,
abduction and external rotation. Abdominal examination
revealed tenderness throughout the lower quadrants.
There were no signs of rebound tenderness and bowel
sounds were present. There was some discomfort in the left
groin on deep palpation and tenderness in the left buttock
lateral to the ischial tuberosity. No inguinal lymph nodes
were palpable. The left hip and thigh were tender to
palpation, but no erythema or swelling was noted.
Movements of his left hip were limited. Specifically, he
had an extension of 15°, flexion of 60°, abduction of 15°,
adduction of 10°, whilst internal rotation and external
rotation were 10° each. Active straight leg-raising was only
possible up to 10° and painful. Pace’s and Freiberg’s signs
were both positive. No sensory or motor deficit of his left
lower limb was noted. All the other joints had a full range
of motion and were symptom-free.
Initial laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell count
of 11.0 K/uL (neutrophils 90%), CRP 168 mg/l, and ESR
32 mm/h. His serum electrolytes and coagulation screen
were within normal limits. Routine radiographs of both
hips and pelvis were normal. Urine culture showed no
growth. Blood cultures were also performed. Abdominal
ultrasound did not reveal any pathology. Subsequently,
the patient was admitted to hospital for comprehensive
diagnostic workup, bed rest and analgesia. Intravenous
antibiotics [ciprofloxacin (400 mg; 1 × 2,) clindamycin
(600 mg; 1 × 3) and meropenem (1 gr; 1 × 3)] were
commenced empirically after blood cultures were taken.
The differential diagnosis included septic arthritis, juvenile
rheumatoid arthritis, osteomyelitis with periosteal
involvement of the left pubic bone and/or the ischial
tuberosity and iliopsoas pyomyositis.
The next day his clinical condition and his laboratory
investigations showed considerable deterioration. He was
pyrexial at 41° C with rigors and severe hip pain, whilst
range of motion of his left hip became severely limited.
Tenderness over the left pubic bone increased significantly.
His CRP rose to 172 mg/l and the ESR was 46 mm/h.
Furthermore, SCOT was 125 U/L, SGPT was 117 U/L and
gGT was 46 U/L. The Ra test, ANA, P-ANCA, C-ANCA,
Parvo-virus, Cocxackie and Echovirus IgM and IgG were all
negative. A bone scintiscan and an MRI of the pelvic/hip
and the lumbar spine were performed the following day.
The 99 mTc CT-scan revealed increased local activity in the
region of the left ischium, pubis and the ipsilateral
acetabulum at all three phases. These findings were in
line with osteomyelitis (Figure 1). The MRI of his lumbar
spine was unremarkable, whereas the pelvic/hip MRI
demonstrated slightly increased signal in the left pubis,
adjacent to the pubic symphysis suggesting osteitis pubis,
although osteomyelitis could not be excluded. Increased
signal was revealed also in the proximal segment of the
obturator internus muscle and the obturator externus
muscle with minimal fluid collection and slight edema of
the neighboring soft tissues. No abscess cavity was seen
(Figure 2). Meanwhile blood cultures grew Staphylococcus
aureus resistant to amoxicillin and ampicillin but sensitive
to ciprofloxacin, clindamycin and teicoplanin. After
consultation with the department of microbiology, it

increased activity in the region of the left ischium and pubis
and the ipsilateral acetabulum, which is associated with
osteomyelitis of these regions.

was decided to replace meropenem with teicoplanin
(400 mg; 1 × 1 IV). This regime carried on for three weeks.
Seventy-two hours after the initiation of teicoplanin the
patient became apyrexial and his local symptoms subsided.
A week later his gait returned to normal. There was no more
tenderness over the left pubic bone. His ESR dropped to
24 mm/h. The patient was discharged fifteen days later. At
the time of discharge, he was symptom-free. He carried on
with oral antibiotics (ciprofloxacin 500 mg; 1 × 2 per os)
for one month. On his last follow-up at six months in the
outpatients department, he was completely asymptomatic
and had returned to his previous normal daily activities. His
ESR and CRP were within normal limits.
Discussion
The obturator internus muscle originates from the ante-
rolateral wall of the pelvic cavity around the obturator
foramen. It exits the pelvic cavity through the lesser sciatic
foramen and inserts into the greater trochanter along with
the superior and inferior gemelli. It abducts and externally
rotates the hip joint [1].
Pyomyositis is a primary, subacute, deep bacterial infec-
tion of the skeletal muscle that manifests itself as
localized abscess formation, but may also present as a
diffuse inflammatory or a rapidly progressing myonecrotic
process [5,6]. The disease is common in many parts of
Africa and the South Pacific, thus the name “tropical”
pyomyositis. During the past decades its incidence has
been increasing in non-tropical areas [6]. Because of its
rarity and often vague clinical presentation, it is unlikely to
be considered during the initial differential diagnosis.
Moreover, the diagnosis may be delayed as the affected
muscle is deeply situated and local signs are not apparent.
This delay in diagnosis may result in increased morbidity
and sometimes a significant mortality rate [5]. It may
result in compartment syndrome, septic arthritis with
serious complications and very rarely septicemia resulting
in death [5,6]. Lung and brain abscesses, pericarditis,
myocarditis, endocarditis and renal failure have also been
reported. The long-term sequelae of pyomyositis include
osteomyelitis of adjacent bones, muscle-scarring, residual
weakness and functional impairment [5].
The most frequently affected muscles are the quadriceps,
hamstrings, gluteus and iliopsoas [1,6]. Pyomyositis
originating in the obturator internus or/and externus
muscles is exceptionally rare. As a whole, it occurs most
commonly in children and young adults whilst it exhibits
a 2:1 prevalence in male patients [4-6]. Nevertheless,
obturator internus or/and externus pyomyositis is more
common in females [7]. One possible explanation is the
close proximity of the obturator internus muscle to the
female reproductive organs [4,7,8].
The usual pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus and Strepto-
coccus pyogenes. In a North American study, blood cultures
were positive in 31% cases of pyomyositis. In this study,
purulent material obtained by needle aspiration was
positive for S. aureus in 70% of all cases and 90% in
pediatric patients [9]. Other pathogens described in the
literature are Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae,
Citrobacter freundii, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Neis-
seris gonorrhoeae, Klebsiella pneumonia, Serratia marcescens
and Yersinia enterocolitica [2,4,5,10]. Infection may spread
to the obturator internus muscle directly from trauma,
from the gut or via the female reproductive tract [8,9].
Local trauma is a recognized initiating factor for pyomyo-
sitis [1,5] and has been documented between 21% to 66%
of all cases [1,5,11] Some cases have been attributed to
adjacent osteomyelitis or to more superficial skin infec-
tions. A potential source of bacteraemia is also frequently
identified, such as eczema of the feet as reported by King
et al. [11]. It has been suggested that primary myositis
begins when muscle haematoma from a recent injury
becomes colonized during an episode of bacteraemia
[4,6,11]. In tropical cases, malnutrition, scurvy, thiamine
deficiency, as well as certain infections, notably Dracun-
culus, malaria, filariasis, arbovirus, and leptspirosis seem
to increase the risk of pyomyositis. Other associated
conditions in temperate cases include HIV, via multiple
proposed mechanisms; diabetes mellitus, leukemia, asple-
nia, SLE, scleroderma, Felty’s, zoster, measles, picorna-
virus, coxsackie, arenavirus, sickle cell disease, cancer
chemotherapy, alcoholism, decubitus ulcers, osteomyelitis
and aplastic anemia [5].
The clinical presentation of obturator internus muscle
pyomyositis resembles that of septic arthritis of the hip or
osteomyelitis [5]. In a child who presents with fever, limp,
and hip pain, septic arthritis of the hip must be suspected
Figure 2. (A, B) Pelvic/hip MRI demonstrating slightly
increased signal in the left pubis, adjacent to the pubic
symphysis, suggesting ostietis pubis or osteomyelitis. Increased
signal reveals mainly to the proximal segment of the obturator
internus muscle and hereupon to the obturator externus
muscle with little fluid collection, and slight edema of the soft
tissue, but with no abscess cavities.

and excluded. If septic arthritis is not confirmed, other
conditions such as toxic synovitis, osteomyelitis, discitis,
pyomyositis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and malig-
nancy should be considered [1-3,6,8]. The most common
physical findings are restriction of all hip movements and
tenderness over the hip and groin region [1,3,4,6]. An
enlarging obturator internus abscess may cause pressure
on the obturator or sciatic nerve thereby causing radiating
leg pain (Table 1) [1,2,6]. As the obturator internus muscle
is deeply located, infection can be difficult to diagnose
clinically.
Furthermore, laboratory studies for pyomyositis are not
very specific. Early radiological evaluation is essential. The
diagnosis always requires MRI confirmation nowadays,
whereas sometimes 99 mTc ST-scan is very helpful.
Computed tomography may also be used to guide pus
aspiration [11]. MRI appears to be the most sensitive test
[5,10-13].
For our young male patient in this case, it is important
firstly to mention the acute onset of painful symptoms
from his hip in association with a pyrexia of 41° C and
rigors. Of note, this patient did not have a relevant past
medical history (trauma, recent illness or foreign travel).
The second notable point is the considerable deterioration
of his clinical condition after 24 hours. His pain grew in
severity, whilst the range of motion of his left hip became
severely limited. His position of comfort was with the hip
in flexion, abduction and external rotation. With this
clinical image we considered the possibility of septic
arthritis. Nevertheless, our differential diagnosis also
included juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, osteomyelitis
with periosteal involvement of the left pubic bone and/
or the ischial tuberosity and iliopsoas pyomyositis.
The fact that there was some discomfort over his left groin
on deep palpation and the associated significant tender-
ness over his left pubic bone led us to thoroughly
investigate the possibility of hip pyomyositis. The MRI
and the 99 mTc ST-scans that were performed were
extremely helpful in demonstrating the diagnosis of a
rare case of obturator internus pyomyositis. As it has
already been mentioned, the long-term sequelae of
pyomyositis include osteomyelitis of adjacent bones,
muscle-scarring, residual weakness and functional impair-
ment [5]. In our case the 99 mTc ST-scan demonstrated
osteomyelitis of the left pubis (Figure 1). The thorough
clinical examination and laboratory investigations in
association with the results of the blood cultures that
grew Staphylococcus aureus resistant to amoxicillin and
ampicillin helped us to decide in favour of a conservative
treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Consequently, his
clinical condition improved rapidly without the need for
surgical drainage. More importantly, the patient recovered
completely without any long-term sequelae.
In most of the patients with obturator internus pyomyo-
sitis, treatment with intravenous antibiotics alone is
sufficient. Antibiotics of choice should be efficient against
S. aureus, for instance nafcillin or cefazolin [5]. Blind
coverage for immunocompromised patients should
include broader spectrum coverage for gram negatives
and anaerobic organisms, such as gentamine and clin-
damine [5,8,9,12]. Drainage is indicated where pus is
present. The duration of antibiotics has not been
established and can vary from 2 to 6 weeks, depending
on the clinical severity and patient response to antibiotics
[5,8,9,12]. Most individuals recover completely with no
long-term sequelae.
Conclusion
We present a rare case of obturator internus pyomyositis in
a 16-year-old Caucasian male and we highlight the
importance of clinical examination and laboratory tests
in association with the relevant radiological investigations
in the form of MRI and 99 mTc ST-scans. A complete
systematic clinical examination, including examination of
the abdomen and groin in every child or young adult
that presents with a painful hip and pyrexia, is mandatory
and was extremely helpful in establishing our final
diagnosis.
Obturator internus muscle infection should be included
in the differential diagnosis of a child or adolescent
presenting with fever, limp and hip/abdominal pain. Early
and accurate diagnosis is important as the condition is
curable. Otherwise, infection may extend to adjacent
structures and if uncontrolled, may cause permanent
disability or even death in extreme cases. Early diagnosis,
established with MRI or CT, prevents surgical intervention
and allows successful treatment with antibiotics. When
pyomyositis of the OIM is diagnosed, an antistaphylo-
coccal antibiotic such as semi-synthetic penicillin or a
second-generation cephalosporin should be initiated.
Surgical drainage is indicated if the patient fails to respond
to medical therapy or if an unusual organism is suspected,
as is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients.
Table 1. Clinical stages of pyomyositis
Stage 1 – Crampy local muscle pain, swelling, low-grade fever, mild
leukocytosis, induration of muscles leading to a ‘woody’
texture.
– No fluctuance and aspiration with not yield pus.
– About 2% of patients present in this stage.
Stage 2 – 10-21 days after onset of symptoms.
– Fever, exquisite tenderness, edema, marked leukocytosis
with eosinophilia in many tropical cases.
– Aspiration will yield pus.
– > 90% cases present at this stage.
Stage 3 – Bacteremia, toxic appearance, marked fluctuance.
