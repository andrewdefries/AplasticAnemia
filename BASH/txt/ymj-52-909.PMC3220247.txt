Recently, the geriatric population in Korea has grown to comprise approximately
10% of the total population, and anemia has become a significant problem among el-
derly patients. Many elderly patients have anemia due to nutritional deficiency,
chronic inflammation, or comorbid diseases; however, in a significant fraction of the
patients with anemia, the cause remains obscure. Anemia of any degree is recog-
nized as a significant independent contributor to morbidity and mortality in elderly
patients. This article summarizes the patterns of anemia in Korean geriatric patients.
Key Words: 	Anemia, Korean elderly, anemia pattern
INTRODUCTION
Hematologic disorders in elderly individuals often present difficult diagnostic and
therapeutic dilemmas to practitioners. Practitioners must decide whether the pres-
ence of a hematologic disorder is indicative of a true disease state and how aggres-
sively such findings should be pursued.
There is a fairly widespread assumption that mild to moderate anemia may de-
velop due to the aging process alone. However, anemia and other disorders of the
hematopoietic system in an elderly person require the same evaluation of the un-
derlying mechanism as that one would carry out in a younger patient, and evalua-
tion for reversible causes of anemia may be warranted. Occult bleeding, malignan-
cy, anemia associated with chronic disorders, or rarer conditions may be found. In
disorders for which effective treatment exists, the response in an elderly person
will be as successful as in younger patients.1
CHANGES IN NORMALHEMATOPOIESIS WITHAGE
Bone marrow cellularity decreases by approximately one third after 65 years of
age as part of a decline in marrow activity with advancing age that begins at
around the age of 30.2
While renewal of peripheral blood cells remains normal
with advancing age, except in times of excess stress, there is a reduction in bone
marrow stem cell reserves and proliferative capacity with age. Elderly patients
may not respond to bleeding with the same degree of reticulocytosis as younger
patients.3

ination and other tests would have revealed some other
causes such as myelodysplasia, thus prompting the use of
the term anemia of senescence14
or senile anemia.
Guralnik15
estimated in the third National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey (NHANES Ⅲ) that a substantial
proportion (one third) of anemia is of indeterminate causes.
Impaired erythropoietin (EPO) responsiveness of the he-
matopoietic stem cell has been implicated in the pathophysi-
ology of anemia in elderly patients.16
Our data also revealed
inappropriately low EPO levels.17
Another mechanism for the
impaired EPO response associated with unexplained anemia
in the elderly population has been postulated to be due to ele-
vated proinflammatory markers such as an iron regulatory
hormone, hepcidin;18
however, there was no clear association
between them.19
Analysis of the relationship between vitamin
D deficiency and anemia in older individuals in the NHANES
Ⅲ did not reveal any significant correlation.20
The classic signs and symptoms of pallor, weakness, and
fatigue may be present in the anemic elderly patient. The
initial manifestations may be symptoms of specific end or-
gan dysfunction, behavioral changes and confusional states,
ischemic chest pain, congestive heart failure, pulmonary
decompensation, syncope, or falls.
A relatively small improvement in hemoglobin level may
produce dramatic symptomatic improvement. Transfusion
should be performed over 3-4 hours to avoid precipitation
of angina or congestive heart failure. An elevated reticulo-
cyte count represents an appropriate response to anemia by
the bone marrow and may suggest a hemolytic process,
blood loss, or recent recovery from a toxin or nutritional defi-
ciency. Low reticulocyte count is accompanied by hypopro-
liferative anemia and aplastic anemia.
Anemia can be morphologically categorized as microcyt-
ic, normocytic, or macrocytic.
MICROCYTICANEMIA
Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and the anemia of chronic
disease (ACD) in their later phases are microcytic. MCV,
serum iron, and transferin saturation are decreased in IDA,
and serum ferritin is decreased in IDAbut not inACD. RDW
is increased in IDA, but not in ACD.21
Sometimes, serum
iron and total iron binding capacity are not reliable indices
in the elderly, due to their wide fluctuations in disease states
and the tendency for serum iron to decrease with age in the
absence of true iron deficiency.22
Low serum ferritin is di-
The mean hemoglobin level is 1 g/dL lower in elderly fe-
males compared with younger females and 2 g/dLlower in el-
derly males compared with younger males.4
Most normal el-
derly men continue to maintain normal hemoglobin levels
even in old age. If there is a significant decline in hemoglobin
below the normal adult range in an elderly individual, espe-
cially below 10.5 g/dL, practitioners must assume that a
pathologic process is present until proven otherwise. In Ko-
rea, Song, et al.5
reported geriatric male and female hemoglo-
bin levels of 13.9 g/dLand 12.7 g/dL, respectively. Our study6
revealed that the mean hemoglobin level among men was
14.8 g/dL, which was significantly different than the control
level of 15.5 g/dL (p<0.001). The hemoglobin level among
geriatric women was 12.9 g/dL, which was also significantly
different than the control level of 12.6 g/dL(p=0.038).
Subclinical alternations, such as slight increases in red
cell size7
and membrane viscosity,8
have been noted among
elderly patients. In Korea, our study9
revealed a mean MCV
in geriatric men of 94.7±4.3 fl (range, 86.3-103.1 fl), which
was significantly higher than that of the control men (93.7±
3.8 fl, p=0.03). In geriatric women, the mean MCV was
91.7±3.5 fl (range, 84.8-98.6 fl) with no significant differ-
ence when compared to controls (91.3±3.7 fl, p=0.421).
These findings may be due to somewhat shortened red cell
life span and slight decrements in enzyme content and met-
abolic activity in elderly patients.10
A 20-40% increase in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate
in the elderly11
may be due to associated chronic disease,
subclinical alternations in plasma proteins, or both; there-
fore, its utility as a screening test is limited.
HEMATOPOIETIC DISORDERS
Anemia is the most frequently encountered hematologic
problem in the elderly. It is a sign of an underlying problem
and may be primary or secondary in nature. According to
WHO criteria, anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level less
than 13 gm/dL in men and 12 gm/dL in women. Among
presumably healthy individuals over the age of 65, 12-25%
of the population has a hemoglobin level below the usual
limit.12
Clinically, in men and women with a hemoglobin
level less 12 gm/dL, an etiology is determined in the major-
ity of cases,13
such as chronic disorders (inflammation, in-
fection, neoplasm), chronic kidney disease and nutritional
deficiencies (iron, folate/vit B12). However, specific causes
of anemia are often unknown though a bone marrow exam-

Thalassemia minor, which is very rare in Korea, involves
genetically-determined abnormal globin chain synthesis
that results in decreased hemoglobin production. A blood
film and hemoglobin assay are needed for diagnosis.
The incidence of sideroblastic anemia is increasing in the
elderly. This type of anemia is characterized by increased
serum iron, increased saturation, and elevated serum ferri-
tin. In the bone marrow, iron-laden red cell precursors, ring
sideroblasts, are noted. Sideroblastic anemia may be sec-
ondary to pyridoxine deficiency, drugs, or alcohol, but in
the elderly, it also occurs in an acquired idiopathic form,
such as refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts of the
myelodysplastic syndrome. Treatment is symptomatic.
MACROCYTICANEMIA
In the elderly, macrocytic megaloblastic anemia is most fre-
quently due to a deficiency of folic acid or vitamin B12. Al-
though such types of anemia constitute a small percentage
of anemia cases, they are of considerable importance be-
cause of their correctability.
Serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels are
very sensitively increased at early stage of folate or vit B12
deficiency even in their normal blood levels.
Folic acid deficiency is found more often than vitamin
B12 deficiency.23
Elderly people often fail to meet the daily
requirement of 50 μg of folic acid because of decreased
food intake. Body stores of folate are limited and may be
exhausted within weeks to months, and folate metabolism
may be affected adversely by alcohol ingestion.27
Serum fo-
late levels less than 3 ng/mL usually indicate deficiency, but
are not always helpful because 10% of presumably healthy
elderly individuals have been found to have the levels be-
low the normal limit.6
Red blood cell folate concentration is
more valuable, and a level less than 102.6 ng/mL is defined
as deficient. Folic acid deficiency is readily corrected by ad-
ministering 1 mg of folic acid orally per day.
Vitamin B12 deficiency in the elderly is seen in the setting
of pernicious anemia, which is due to a lack of intrinsic fac-
tor production by the gastric parietal cells. Chronic atrophic
gastritis, previous gastrectomy, or disease of the terminal il-
eum can also produce vitamin B12 deficiency in the elderly.
The normal lower limit in the elderly is uncertain because of
the progressive decrease in serum B12 levels with advancing
age. Typically, patients at levels less than 180 pg/mL are
considered deficient. A Shilling test can hardly be per-
agnostic of iron deficiency, but may be falsely elevated by
liver disease or inflammatory disorders.23
If serum ferritin is
nondiagnostic, soluble transferrin receptor measurement is
available, even though scarsely anemia must be assessed by
bone marrow aspiration.
IDA
In Korea, our study revealed a low mean hemoglobin level of
7.8±2.2 g/dL and a decreased serum iron level of 22.7±12.3
μg/dL with a decreased transferrin saturation of 6.7±4.1%.
There was no increase in TIBC (357.2±83.2 μg/dL), and
ferritin levels were decreased to 18.9±14.6 ng/dL among
men and 9.2±6.3 ng/dL among women with an upper limit
of 37 ng/dL.24
Causes of iron deficiency include decreased absorption,
perhaps with gastric achlorhydria, prior gastrectomy or,
rarely, dietary iron deficiency as in the case of tea-and-toast
lady syndrome. Most cases are due to gastrointestinal blood
losses secondary to drugs, peptic ulcer disease, stomach can-
cer, colon carcinoma, diverticulitis, or vascular abnormali-
ties. Treatment can generally be accomplished with ferrous
sulfate 300 mg for six months which can be administered
as a liquid suspension or parenterally as necessary such as
in malabsorbtion or when cannot tolerate oral iron supple-
mentation.
ACD
Anemia of chronic disease is due to hepcidin, which block
the release of iron from the reticuloendothelial system, there-
by resulting in abnormal iron utilization. Serum EPO level
is not increased sufficiently relative to the severity of the
anemia, because of inflammatory cytokines.25
Our study of
serum erythropoietin also revealed an inappropriately low
response to this type of anemia.26
This type of anemia is
quite common in the elderly, owing to the high incidence of
chronic inflammatory disease in this age group.
Measurement of serum iron and total iron binding capac-
ity does not reliably distinguish ACD from iron deficiency
anemia. Serum ferritin levels may not be decreased, there-
fore, bone marrow examination may be needed to exclude
hypoproliferative anemia. Underlying problems, such as
chronic inflammatory states, infections, or neoplastic disor-
ders, should be corrected.

NORMOCYTIC NORMOCHROMIC
ANEMIA
Blood loss should always be initially suspected as the cause
of this type of anemia. The elderly patient should not be ex-
pected to report melena, and a blood film and reticulocyte
count are essential. Early iron deficiency anemia or anemia
of chronic disease may be normocytic. Vitamin B12 and fo-
late deficiency may not be associated with macrocytosis if
there is concurrent iron deficiency.
A blood film with microspherocytes suggests undiscov-
ered hereditary spherocytosis which is occasionally but most-
ly immune hemolytic anemia; the drug-induced type is more
common in the elderly. A normocytic hypoproliferative ane-
mia with abnormal burr cells on the blood film may be seen
in chronic renal disease. Hyperthyroidism and other endo-
crine insufficiencies are commonly associated with this
type of anemia in the elderly.
CONCLUSIONS
Anemia has recently become a significant problem in elder-
ly Koreans. The exact etiologies of anemia should be iden-
tified, and it should be treated appropriately according to
various causes of anemia. There is a need for further efforts
to understand the pathogenesis of anemia among the elder-
ly in order to improve outcomes.
