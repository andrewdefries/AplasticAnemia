Abstract
Background: Chronic exposure to high concentrations of benzene is usually associated with the
development of haematological diseases. However, solid tumors induced by benzene exposure are
less frequent.
Case presentation: We present an unusual case of triple synchronous primary malignancies most
likely induced by occupational benzene exposure in a male patient. This spray painter was
diagnosed as chronic aplastic anemia in his 21 years old after exposing to high concentration of
benzene for three years. Then he was treated with glucocorticoid for four years. 40 years later,
this patient developed three synchronous primary neoplasms with three different histologies
including a basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, primary hepatocellular carcinoma,
and well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the gum.
Conclusion: This case reminds us that the occurrence of solid tumors should be monitored in
workers with occupational history linked with a high concentration exposure to benzene, though
it's rarely happened.
Background
Chronic exposure to high concentrations of benzene in
humans is usually associated with the development and
progression of leukaemia and other haematological dis-
eases [1-3]. Less frequently, solid tumors induced by ben-
zene exposure may occur.
We present a rare case of triple synchronous primary
malignancies with chronic aplastic anemia induced by
strongly related occupational benzene exposure in a male
patient. This patient had three primary neoplasms with
three different histologies including a basaloid squamous
cell carcinoma of the esophagus, primary hepatocellular
carcinoma, and well-differentiated squamous cell carci-
noma of the gum. These neoplasms simultaneously
occurred 40 years after benzene exposure.
Case presentation
A 61-year old male patient was admitted to our hospital
in May 2007 with a solid mass in the right-inferior gum
for almost a year and progressive enlargement in latest
two weeks. He had no respiratory or gastrointestinal com-
plaints, and he denied any weight loss. In this spray
painter, chronic aplastic anemia was diagnosed when he
was 21 years old, after a previous three-year exposure to
high concentration of benzene. Consequently, he was
treated with glucocorticoid for four years. After that this
patient lived together with his brother in Hangzhou, and

he only did some houseworks. He had never smoked nor
been exposed to smoking environment. 40 years later,
three synchronous primary neoplasms including a
basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, pri-
mary hepatocellular carcinoma and well-differentiated
squamous cell carcinoma of the gum were diagnosed in
this patient.
In late October 2006, he developed progressive dysphagia
and a barium swallow and computed tomography (CT) of
esophagus showed an esophageal neoplasm. Esoph-
agogastroscopy and histopathological analysis of the
biopsy specimen revealed a basaloid squamous cell carci-
noma (Figure 1). The patient underwent a radical opera-
tion of esophageal carcinoma. CT of abdomen showed a
cycloid hypodense lesion with a clear margin in the left
liver. He was suggested follower-up for the lesion in the
liver. The repeated CT of abdomen two month later
showed a little enlargement of the lesion. The patient had
no family history of malignancy. He had also no history
of hepatitis.
On physical examination, a painless rigid mass (2 × 1.5
cm) was found on right-inferior gum near the first molar.
Chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were unremarkable.
The bone marrow puncture and biopsy was performed
and showed the marrow failure. Hepatic ultrasonography
revealed two low echoic masses at level S2-3 (maximum
diameter 3.9 cm), and the entire liver parenchyma had
heterogeneous echogenicity. Histopathological analysis
of the biopsy specimen revealed primary hepatocellular
carcinoma (Figure 2). A gum biopsy from the mass was
performed, and showed well-differentiated squamous cell
carcinoma (Figure 3). So the patient underwent a radical
operation for the mass on June 23, 2007. Neither adjuvant
chemical therapy nor radiation therapy was given during
the period of hospitalization. The patient was discharged
on July 16, 2007. Five months later, he died of massive
hemorrhage of gastrointestinal tract induced by thrombo-
cytopenia.
Discussion
This is a case report of a patient diagnosed with three syn-
chronous primary tumors and who had previous occupa-
tional benzene exposure for 3 years (1964–1966) and an
acute benzene poisoning.
Multiple primary malignant neoplasms (MPMN) in a sin-
gle patient are not frequent. The majority of MPMN occur-
ring in multiple organs are metachronous, while the
synchronous tumors, which are defined that two or more
primary tumors are diagnosed within 6 months of the first
primary tumor, are less frequent. Our case had three such
synchronous primary neoplasms. Regarding the aetiology
of multiple primary malignancies, several factors have
been incriminated: genetic, hormonal (e.g. sex steroids),
environmental, iatrogenic (e.g. chemotherapy, radiation
therapy, hormonal and immunosuppressive medica-
tions) and immunologic factors (the loss of immunity).
In this case, the benzene exposure history was considered
as the most possible causative factor for his MPMN.
Benzene and its metabolites are highly clastogenic[4].
Chronic exposure to high concentrations of benzene in
humans is associated with hematotoxicities, including

pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia, and acute
myeloid leukemia [5-7]. The hematotoxicity of benzene is
related to the amount and duration of exposure. At high
levels of exposure (air concentration > 100 ppm), the inci-
dence of aplastic anemia is approximately 1/100 individ-
uals exposed; at lower levels of exposure (10–20 ppm),
this drops abruptly to approximately 1/10,000[8].
Although the exact benzene exposure level for this patient
could not be determined, some earlier studies of benzene
exposure provided useful information [5,6]. In a NCI-
CAPM study, Dosemeci et al provided that the expose
level for "spray painter" at a Shanghai bicycle factory dur-
ing 1965–1969 was 331 mg/m3 or 104.1 ppm[5]. The
author also implicated that some engineering changes
took place over the years, resulting in lower exposure lev-
els. Thus, exposure for spray painters before 1965 should
be the same as, or more likely, higher than those recorded
during 1965–1969. Wong also pointed out the actual
level might be higher than that in the NCI-CAPM
study[6]. According to these studies, we can estimate that
the benzene exposure level for this patient would be much
higher at that time. It seemed almost certain that his ben-
zene exposure history played a key role in the occurring of
aplastic anemia.
The relationship between benzene exposure and solid
tumor is not known well. According to a previous study in
12 cities in China[9], a small increase was observed in
total cancer mortality among benzene-exposed compared
with unexposed workers (relative risk [RR] = 1.2). Statisti-
cally significant excess was noted for lung cancer (RR =
1.4), but less than leukemia (RR = 2.3). Some studies
showed that there was no indication of increased inci-
dences of solid tumors for chronic benzene exposed work-
ers or children [10-12]. However, animal experimental
results showed that several solid tumors occured in the
Zymbal gland, oral and nasal cavities, liver, and mam-
mary gland of Sprague-Dawley rats following chronic,
high-dose administration of benzene, which was thought
to be caused by activation of toxic metabolites that can
interact with DNA, and form covalent adducts[13].
Treatment for aplastic anemia is another possible cause of
multiple tumors. Long-term administration of androgenic
steroids for aplastic anemia was reported in some cases
correlating to multiple neoplasms[14,15]. Our patient
had never taken androgen but glucocorticoid to treat the
aplastic anemia. To our knowledge, there was no case
reported that glucocorticoid treatment for aplastic anemia
resulted in the occurrence of MPMN.
Conclusion
This is a rare case manifesting a combination of three syn-
chronous primary malignant neoplasms and chronic
aplastic anemia most likely induced by occupational ben-
zene exposure. It reminds us that the occurrence of solid
tumors should be monitored in workers with occupa-
tional history linked with a high concentration exposure
to benzene, though it's rarely happened.
