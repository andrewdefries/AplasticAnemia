Abstract
Background: Differentiation of pluripotent stem cells in vitro provides a powerful means to investigate early developmental
fates, including hematopoiesis. In particular, the use of a fully defined medium (FDM) would avoid biases induced by
unidentified factors contained in serum, and would also allow key molecular mediators involved in such a process to be
identified. Our goal was to induce in vitro, the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (ESC) and induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSC) into morphologically and phenotypically mature leukocytes and erythrocytes, in the complete absence of
serum and feeder cells.
Methodology/Principal Findings: ESC and iPSC were sequentially induced in liquid cultures for 4 days with bone
morphogenic protein-4, and for 4 days with FLT3-ligand, stem cell factor, thrombopoietin and vascular endothelium growth
factor. Cell differentiation status was investigated by both mRNA expression and FACS expression profiles. Cells were further
sorted and assayed for their hematopoietic properties in colony-forming unit (CFU) assays. In liquid cultures, cells
progressively down-modulated Oct-4 expression while a sizeable cell fraction expressed CD34 de novo. SCL/Tal1 and Runx1
transcripts were exclusively detected in CD34+
cells. In clonal assays, both ESC and iPSC-derived cells generated CFU, albeit
with a 150-fold lower efficacy than cord blood (CB) CD34+
cells. ESC-derived CD34+
cells generated myeloid and fully
hemoglobinized erythroid cells whereas CD342
cells almost exclusively generated small erythroid colonies. Both ESC and
iPSC-derived erythroid cells expressed embryonic and fetal globins but were unable to synthesize adult b-globin in contrast
with CB cells, suggesting that they had differentiated from primitive rather than from definitive hematopoietic progenitors.
Conclusions/Significance: Short-term, animal protein-free culture conditions are sufficient to sustain the differentiation of
human ESC and iPSC into primitive hematopoietic progenitors, which, in turn, produce more mature blood cell types.
However, additional factors have yet to be identified to allow their differentiation into definitive erythroid cultures.

Introduction
Embryonic stem cells (ESC) are derived from the inner cell mass
of the pre-implantation blastocyst [1]. These cells are pluripotent,
self-renewing, and can differentiate into all three embryonic germ
layers – ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. Several studies have
already identified defined culture conditions for directing ESC
differentiation toward the mesodermal hematopoietic lineage
[2,3,4,5,6], and more specifically, terminally differentiated erythro-
cytes and leukocytes have been generated through these strategies
[2,3,7,8,9]. These studies however, used mouse embryonic
fibroblasts as feeder support and poorly defined xenogenic
compounds including serum prior to lineage-specific differentiation.
As serum is replete with various growth factors and growth factor
precursors, such an approach may lead to inter-species contamina-
tion, a fact that would preclude the use of the generated cells for
clinical application. Moreover, the use of ESC raises both
immunological [10,11] and, more controversially, ethical concerns
that may also preclude their use as therapeutic tools. The process of
somatic cell reprogramming, which allows the generation of
pluripotent stem cells exhibiting similar properties to ESC, may
help bypass these concerns [12,13,14]. Recently, two studies showed
that human iPSC could be differentiated toward hematopoiesis
[15,16], however, as for earlier studies with ESC, experiments were
performed in bovine serum-supplemented cocultures, in the
presence of murine stroma. Thus, it remains to be established
whether xenogenic compounds are dispensable for the differenti-
ation of human ESC and iPSC toward the hematopoietic lineage.
Here we show that human ESC and iPSC maintained over
mitotically-inactivated human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) [14] can
differentiate toward the hematopoietic lineage in fully defined
medium devoid of animal proteins when sequentially exposed to

recombinant bone morphogenic protein-4 (BMP-4), a factor
known to enhance mesodermal differentiation of human ESC in
vitro [17,18,19], and to a cocktail of early acting hematopoietic
factors comprising FMS-like tyrosin kinase-3 ligand (FLT3-L),
stem cell factor (SCF), thrombopoietin (TPO) and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Within 8 days, cells down-
modulated Oct-4 expression and upregulated hematopoie-
tic transcription factors such as SCL/Tal1 and Runx1. Cell
suspensions contained hematopoietic progenitors generating
erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage colonies in methylcellu-
lose. It appeared; however, that ESC- and iPSC-derived hemato-
poietic cells remained at an early stage of differentiation, corres-
ponding to transient, primitive hematopoiesis, as they only
expressed embryonic and fetal globins, but not adult b-globins,
which was in contrast with CB cells.
Results
Differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESC) toward the
hematopoietic lineage
During the initial 4-day induction phase with BMP-4 and bFGF
in hypoxic conditions, ESC differentiated toward early mesoder-
mal progenitors, as seen by the rapid decrease of Oct-4 expression
and the transient induction of Brachyury at day 4 (Fig. 1A). After
a subsequent induction of 4 days with VEGF, bFGF, SCF, FLT3-
L and TPO in the absence of BMP-4, Oct-4 expression vanished,
Brachyury sharply decreased and CD34+
cells, undetectable in
undifferentiated ESC suspensions, reached 1666% (mean6SD,
n = 9, Fig. 1B left panel). Differentiated ESC were sorted by
MACS according to CD34 expression. Mean purity was 73617%
(mean6SD, n = 8, Fig. 1B right panel) for the CD34-enriched
fraction (defined as ES34+
) and no contaminating CD34+
cells
were detected in the ES342
fractions upon reanalysis (not shown).
FACS analysis of ES34+
demonstrated that they were CD45-,
MHC-II- and CD38-negative, expressed low levels of MHC-I,
CD43 and c-kit (CD117), and were positive for KDR, CXCR4
and CD31. This phenotype, though distinct from ex vivo CB-
purified CD34+
cells (CB34+
, Fig. 1C) may be consistent with
very immature hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), likely sharing
properties with the hemangioblast [4,17,18]. mRNA analysis
performed on ES34+
and ES342
fractions showed that SCL/Tal1,
which exerts its effect immediately downstream of Brachyury to
differentiate hemangioblasts into haemogenic endothelium [20],
and Runx1, which is mainly expressed in cells differentiating
further from this later step to the hematopoietic lineage [20], were
exclusively expressed in ES34+
(Fig. 1D). Altogether, these
observations suggest that our protocol generates a significant
number of cells with a phenotype reminiscent of hematopoietic
progenitors, yet in an immature stage of differentiation.
ES34+
hematopoietic progeny generated in vitro is larger
and contains more myeloid cells than that of ES342
ES34+
and ES342
were tested for their ability to proliferate
clonally in methylcellulose-based medium complemented with
hematopoietic growth factors. After 14 days of culture, both cell
suspensions generated colonies. Myeloid (CFU-GM) and erythroid
colonies (BFU-E) derived from ES34+
were morphologically
similar to hematopoietic colonies derived from CB34+
cells. By
contrast ES342
produced almost exclusively small-sized erythroid
colonies with a limited burst promoting activity which looked more
like CFU-E rather than BFU-E. Myeloid colonies derived from
ES342
were scarce and could not be documented by photographic
means (Fig. 2A). The frequency of hematopoietic colonies
obtained from ESC-generated hematopoietic progenitors was
approximately 160-fold lower than those obtained from CB34+
cells (Fig. 2B, left panel). Erythroid and CFU-GM colony
frequencies were 9.761024
and 6.161024
for ES34+
(n = 12)
and 1.661023
and 2.561024
for ES342
(n = 5) respectively
(Fig. 2B, right panel). Such a low cloning efficiency led to a large
dispersion of the values that did not allow establishing a significant
difference between ES34+
and ES342
. The erythroid/myeloid
colony ratio was 34% for CB34+
, 61% for ES34+
and 86% for
ES342
cells. Colonies derived from CB34+
contained in average
2.16104
cells/colony, whereas colonies obtained from ES34+
or
ES342
cells contained 36103
and 1.76103
cells/colony, respec-
tively. Thus, ESC differentiated in our assay generated both
myeloid and erythroid colonies, albeit at a lower efficiency as
compared with CB.
Cell suspensions derived from the clonal cultures of ES34+
were
then analyzed by FACS (ES342
numbers were not sufficient to
allow for FACS analysis) and compared to the progeny of CB34+
cells. Cultures derived from ES34+
cells contained both myeloid
and erythroid progenitors (Fig. 2C), and, as for CB-derived
cultures, CD34+
cells were no more detectable (data not shown),
consistent with the differentiation of the progenitors observed in
CFU assays. Cells were also tested for globin gene expression.
While CB-derived CFU expressed embryonic (e), fetal (c) and
adult (b) globin mRNAs, ES34+
exclusively expressed e and c
globins after in vitro differentiation (Fig. 2D). Altogether these
observations - i.e. low frequency of hematopoietic colonies, limited
proliferation, bias toward erythropoiesis and absence of adult
globin synthesis - suggest that ESC differentiated in vitro exhibit a
block in further differentiation that prevents them to reach the
same stage than CB-HSC.
Reprogrammed human somatic cells (iPSC) also generate
hematopoietic progenitors in animal protein-free
differentiation cultures
iPSC have recently been reported to recapitulate major ESC
features, including the ability to differentiate in various cell
lineages in vitro and to generate teratomas [12,13,14]. We therefore
investigated whether iPSC generated in our laboratory upon
reprogramming of HFF (see Figure S1 for in vitro (A-E) and in vivo
(F-H) characterization, and Movie S1 for the presence of beating
cardiomyocytes) behave like bona fide ESC, in particular when
exposed to our protocol of hematopoietic induction. Indeed, as for
ESC, iPSC rapidly down-modulated Oct-4 expression and
transiently expressed Brachyury at day 4. This expression
subsequently decreased when BMP-4 was substituted by early
acting hematopoietic growth factors (Fig. 3A). This substitution
was also associated with the emergence at day 8 of a CD34+
-
KDR+
population that was clearly distinguishable from its
CD342
-KDR2
counterpart (Fig. 3B). Sorted iPS34+
cells
displayed a similar phenotype as their ESC counterpart, including
expression of CD31, CD43 and CXCR4 (Fig 1C, and data not
shown). After sorting and culture in clonogenic conditions, both
iPS34+
and iPS342
produced hematopoietic colonies (Fig. 3C)
with increased frequency of GM colonies in the iPS34+ fractions
(Table 1). However, the large variability observed in these CFU
experiments, including the absence of iPS342
proliferation in
many methylcellulose assays, did not allow establishing a signi-
ficant difference of cloning efficiency between these 2 groups
(Table 1). Nevertheless, the overall cloning frequencies (erythroid
plus CFU-GM) were comparable to those of ESC and approx-
imately 150-fold lower than CB34+
cell frequencies. Interestingly,
iPS34+
, as with ES34+
, expressed e and c, but not b globins (not
shown), consistent with a complete reprogramming of the initial
fibroblasts to an embryonic stage. They also produced in some

observed in ES34+
cultures. Altogether, these data suggest that our
protocol devoid of xenogenic compounds to generate hematopoi-
etic cells could be successfully applied to reprogrammed somatic
cells.
Discussion
Our work describes the generation of hematopoietic progenitors
from human ESC and iPSC induced by the sequential exposure to
BMP-4 and bFGF [17,19], and to a mixture of early-acting
hematopoietic factors in the absence of any xenogenic compound
and feeder cells. Several other protocols have reported the
generation of hematopoietic progenitors from human ESC in
fully defined serum- and feeder-free conditions [17,19], and
similarly to our differentiation procedure, these protocols initially
rely on the ventralizing effect of BMP-4 to induce early
hematopoietic commitment. Kennedy et al. further demonstrated
that hematopoietic potential was strictly dependent on such
signaling [17], however, the mixture of cytokines used subse-
quently, differed between these procedures. Pick et al. used BMP-4
simultaneously with VEGF, SCF and FGF2 for a minimum of 10
days, and reported 13.9% of CD34-expressing cells, with a mean
CFC frequency of approximately 2.261023
. Kennedy et al report
CFC potential in their KDR+
/CD31+
/CD34+
fraction at day 8
(about 361023
), however, they did not observe any CFC potential
in their negative fraction. By supplementing our cultures with
Flt3L, TPO and SCF from day 4 to day 8, we succeeded in
increasing the potential of CD34 expressing cells (up to 20%) while
achieving comparable CFC frequencies (about 2.561023
). More-
over, we observe a significant erythroid potential also from the
CD342
fraction, which resemble the sequential hematopoietic
potential observed in protocols supplemented with serum and/or
feeders [6]. We believe that this choice of early acting cytokines
results in an overall differentiation that is more consistent to what
observed in vivo.
For instance, culture supplementation with Flt3-L, which has
not been documented before in such an animal protein-free
context, may further enhance ESC and iPSC differentiation
toward hematopoiesis in vitro. Indeed, Flt3-L is pivotal for the
maintenance of CB34+
stem cells in long-term cultures [21,22] and
its serum level correlates with the hematopoietic requirement of
the individuals. In particular, patients suffering from severe
chronic hematopoietic dysfunctions such as Fanconi’s anemia
[23,24] exhibit elevated serum levels of Flt3-L in response to the
disease.
After 8 days of differentiation, our protocol produced ESC
progeny comprising of CD34+
and CD342
cells, both able to
generate hematopoietic colonies in methylcellulose-based semi-
solid cultures. ES34+
were CD452
CD382
, KDR+
and CD31+
,
consistent with an immature hemangioblastic phenotype, though
more recent studies claim that hemangioblasts, in addition to
KDR, also express Brachyury [25] which is not the case here.
Thus, our cells may have differentiated beyond the hemangioblast
stage prior to clonal methylcellulose assays. This is consistent with
their slight expression of CD43, which has been previously
reported as an early marker to define hematopoietic progenitors in
human ESC cultures [4]. In contrast with earlier studies [17], our
ES34+
cells did not express CD117 (c-kit). A significant fraction of
ES34+
cells expresses CXCR4, the receptor for stroma-derived
factor (SDF)-1/CXCL-12, which is associated with the homing
and maintenance of HSC in the bone marrow. This observation
was not reported with either ESC (H1 cell line) or iPSC
differentiated in presence of OP9 stroma [3,4], and suggests that
our protocol may achieve the generation of hematopoietic cells
with enhanced in vivo bone marrow homing properties [26]. While
this issue remains to be investigated in vivo using appropriate
reconstitution models [27], we presently consider it unlikely that
our cells, given their primitive-stage phenotype, would achieve a
robust in vivo reconstitution. Although not in the primary intention
of the present study, this point deserves future investigations.
Interestingly, the hematopoietic transcription factors SCL/Tal1
and Runx1 were both exclusively detectable in the CD34+
fraction. This observation is puzzling as SCL expression is
associated with the short-lived, primitive hematopoiesis, whereas
Runx1 is required for definitive hematopoiesis [20]. Thus, the
expression of both markers in the same cell fraction appears rather
contradictory. One can speculate that the in vitro environment may
artificially block CD34+
cells at an intermediate stage between
primitive and definitive hematopoiesis (that is not observed in
unmanipulated cells) which may allow the expression of both
transcripts in the same cells. Alternatively, we cannot exclude that
cultures may contain a mixture of cells exclusively expressing
either factor.
ES342
cells were SCL2
, Runx12
and differentiated mostly in
erythroids, suggesting that they were locked at a rather primitive
stage of hematopoiesis. Indeed, the morphology of our erythroid
colonies generated from ES342
cells, as well as their inability to
generate b-globin, are identical to those described by Kennedy
et al. [17], further suggesting that ES342
cells likely represent
progenitors of primitive and not definitive hematopoiesis. The few
macrophagic colonies observed in the ES342
fraction may
originate from either CD34+
contaminant cells that were too few
to be detected by FACS, or from progenitors of primitive
hematopoiesis that were endowed with the ability to produce
GM colonies at a low frequency [17].
Despite the identification of a sizeable frequency of hemato-
poietic progenitors after clonogenic assays in methylcellulose, the
overall efficacy of our protocol remains low, and for the time
being, incompatible with eventual clinical application. Further
improvements of the method are required to force ESC and iPSC
toward definitive hematopoiesis. Foetal HSC may not be fully
responsive to the hematopoietic growth factors present in the CFU
assay, and such a lack of response may contribute to the apparent
paucity of HSC generated in vitro. Indeed, we cannot discern
whether the observed low frequency of progenitors (i.e. 100 fold
less than in CB) is due to the real absence of these cells or is related
to their inability, probably due to a lack of sufficient differenti-
ation, to respond efficiently to the classical assay performed in this
study. Moreover, in light of recently published data [28], the

particularly low hematopoietic efficiency of iPSC may also be due
to an increased sensitivity to apoptosis as compared to ESC in vitro.
Further investigations and new approaches are required to
establish the full potential of ESC and iPSC once induced toward
the hematopoietic lineage in vitro. Nevertheless, this work
contributes to the demonstration that it is possible to generate
in vitro hematopoietic progenitors from ESC and iPSC in an
environment devoid of xenogenic compounds, which represent
one of the requirements to be fulfilled before manipulated cells can
be envisaged for use in clinical applications.
Materials and Methods
Human ESC and iPSC cultures
Human embryonic stem cell lines (H1 line [1]; HS181 [29] and
HS401 [30]) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-w
line, referred in the text as iPSC, derived from lentivirally
transduced human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) with OCT-4/
SOX2/NANOG/LIN28 reprogramming genes as initially dem-
onstrated in [13]) were maintained and expanded over irradiated
HFF [14]. Knock-out serum (KSR, Invitrogen)-supplemented
media was used for propagation, supplemented with 4 ng/ml of
basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, R&D Systems) for ESC
cultures, and 100 ng/ml bFGF for iPSC cultures. Cells were fed
on a daily basis and weekly passaged using collagenase IV (1 mg/
ml, Roche) or manual dissection when required.
Hematopoietic differentiation
Confluent human ESC and iPSC colonies were disrupted to
small aggregates using collagenase IV (1 mg/ml, 15 minutes at
37 uC). Cell aggregates were resuspended in StemPro fully defined
medium (StemPro-34 Serum-Free Media, Gibco proprietary
formulation, guaranteed as animal protein-free by the manufac-
turer) supplemented with 0.5 ng/ml human recombinant BMP-4
(R&D Systems) at a ratio of 2 confluent ESC/iPSC wells for 1 well
of differentiation. During all the differentiation process, cell
attachment was prevented using low cluster tissue culture dishes
(Corning Costar). On day 1 of differentiation, embryoid bodies
(EB) were harvested and transferred to fresh StemPro media
supplemented with 10 ng/ml BMP-4 and 5 ng/ml bFGF. After 72
hours, EB were harvested again and transferred to « hematopoietic
medium » consisting of StemPro media supplemented with
100 ng/ml human recombinant VEGF (R&D Systems), 5 ng/ml
bFGF, 100 ng/ml SCF (kind gift from Amgen), 100 ng/ml FLT3-L

(kind gift from Amgen) and 40 ng/ml TPO (Peprotech, UK) for 4
additional days. All differentiation steps were performed in hypoxic
conditions (5% O2) in a humidified incubator at 37 uC.
Analysis of hematopoiesis and clonogenic assays
After 8 days of differentiation, EB were harvested and spun at
65 g for 4 min. Supernatants containing non-adherent cells were
stored on ice and EB were disrupted using Trypsin-EDTA
followed by manual disruption in FBS-containing blocking
medium using a 21G needle. After centrifugation, cells were
resuspended in freshly prepared collagenase IV solution (0.2 mg/
ml) for 30 min at 37 uC. Cells were disrupted again using a 21G
needle and filtered over a 70 mm cell strainer (Falcon).
Supernatants from the initial centrifugation were pooled with
these suspensions and magnetic bead associated cell sorting
(MACS) for the CD34 epitope was performed following
manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotech). Human clonogenic
progenitor assays were performed by plating undifferentiated
ESC, ESC-derived CD34+
and CD342
cells as well as CB34+
cells
in a methylcellulose-containing medium (Methocult GF H84434,
Stem Cell Technologies France). All clonogenic progenitor assays
were performed in duplicates. Counts were performed after
incubation at 37 uC, 5% CO2 for 14 days in a humidified
atmosphere. In some instances, cells from CFU assays were
washed out from the methylcellulose by gentle pipetting in Hank’s
balanced solution. Single cell suspensions were utilized for flow
cytometry analysis or RNA extraction.
Flow cytometry
Cell suspensions were analyzed after staining with antibodies
specific for CD34, CD45, CXCR4, KDR (VEGF-receptor),
CD117, CD38, CD31, CD43, MHC class I, MHC class II,
Glycophorin-A (GPA) (BD Biosciences, Miltenyi and R&D
Systems). Dead cells were identified as 7-amino actinomycin D
(7AAD)-high cells and excluded. Cells were stained in PBS
containing 20% of human AB serum (Sigma) to prevent unspecific
binding. Data were collected on a FACS Calibur device (BD
Biosciences) and analyzed with the Flowjo software (Treestar).
Reverse transcription, PCR and quantitative PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted using the RNA easy Microkit (Qiagen)
following manufacturer’s instructions, including a DNAse I treatment
to remove residual genomic DNA. cDNA was synthesized with
random hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitro-
gen). Real-time PCR was performed using a sequence detector
