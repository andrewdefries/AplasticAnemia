Introduction
DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) are among the most dan-
gerous forms of DNA damage. Unrepaired DSBs signal cells
to die, whereas misprocessing of DSBs can lead to genomic
instability and oncogenic transformation. DSBs are primar-
ily repaired by the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and
homologous recombination (HR) repair pathways. The NHEJ
pathway joins the two ends of a DSB directly with little or no
requirement for homology, whereas HR uses the intact identical
copy of the broken chromosome as a template. Although both
NHEJ and HR proteins are recruited to DSBs, pathway choice
is regulated in part by the cell cycle phase, with HR being active
in S/G2 and NHEJ contributing to DSB repair predominantly
in G0/G1. For example, V(D)J (variable [diversity] joining)
recombination-associated breaks are generated in G0/G1 and
resolved by NHEJ proteins, whereas meiotic DSBs are pro-
cessed by HR proteins. Nevertheless, a recent study indicates
competition between HR and NHEJ for replication- and ioniz-
ing radiation (IR)–induced DSBs during the S and G2 phase of
the cell cycle (Sonoda et al., 2006).
T
he nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway
is essential for radioresistance and lymphocyte-
specific V(D)J (variable [diversity] joining) recombi-
nation. Defects in NHEJ also impair hematopoietic stem
cell (HSC) activity with age but do not affect the initial
establishment of HSC reserves. In this paper, we report that,
in contrast to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)–dependent
protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs)–null mice,
knockin mice with the DNA-PKcs3A/3A
allele, which codes
for three alanine substitutions at the mouse Thr2605 phos-
phorylation cluster, die prematurely because of congenital
bone marrow failure. Impaired proliferation of DNA-
PKcs3A/3A
HSCs is caused by excessive DNA damage and
p53-dependent apoptosis. In addition, increased apopto-
sis in the intestinal crypt and epidermal hyperpigmenta-
tion indicate the presence of elevated genotoxic stress and
p53 activation. Analysis of embryonic fibroblasts further
reveals that DNA-PKcs3A/3A
cells are hypersensitive to
DNA cross-linking agents and are defective in both
homologous recombination and the Fanconi anemia DNA
damage response pathways. We conclude that phosphory­
lation of DNA-PKcs is essential for the normal activation
of multiple DNA repair pathways, which in turn is critical
for the maintenance of diverse populations of tissue stem
cells in mice.

strategy (Bunting et al., 1999). The ACN cassette, including a
testes-specific tACE promoter-driven Cre recombinase, a Neo-
selectable marker, and two flanking loxP sites, was fused with
two genomic fragments with the longer fragment carrying mu-
tated exon 58 (covering the entire mouse Thr2605 cluster) in
close proximity to the ACN cassette (Fig. 1 B). Upon successful
gene targeting and subsequent germline transmission in chime-
ric mice, expression of Cre recombinase during spermatogenesis
self-excises the ACN cassette. This process leaves behind one
remaining loxP site and allows the expression of the 3A mutant
DNA-PKcs from the targeted allele. Using this strategy, two
knockin mouse lines were generated from two independently
targeted embryonic stem (ES) cell clones. Analyses of mice and
cultured cells yielded identical phenotypes from both lines.
Alanine substitutions at all three threonine sites (Thr2605,
Thr2634, and Thr2643) of the targeted allele were confirmed by
sequencing DNA isolated from tails of heterozygotic (DNA-
PKcs+/3A
) carriers. The sequencing profile showed equal detec-
tion ofA from the wild-type allele and G from the targeted allele
at all three mutated positions (Fig. S1 A). The 3A substitution and
The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) consists
of the large catalytic subunit (DNA-PK catalytic subunit
[DNA-PKcs]) and the DNA-binding Ku70/80 heterodimer. The
DSB is initially recognized by DNA-PK. The ends are then
synapsed and processed by other NHEJ proteins, including
Artemis, XLF, and XRCC4, before they are ligated together by
ligase IV (Weterings and Chen, 2008). DNA-PKcs belongs to a
serine/threonine protein kinase family known as the phosphati-
dylinositol-3 kinase–like protein kinases. Family members
include ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM- and
Rad3-related (ATR) kinases (Shiloh, 2003). DNA-PKcs, itself,
is essential for NHEJ-mediated DSB repair, and loss of the
DNA-PKcs protein leads to radiation hypersensitivity as well as
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) caused by a block
in V(D)J recombination. In addition, DNA-PKcs deficiency re-
sults in a defect in immunoglobulin class switch recombination
(Manis et al., 2002; Cook et al., 2003; Callén et al., 2009).
DNA-PKcs is phosphorylated in several regions in vitro upon
activation and in vivo upon treatment with IR (Chan et al., 2002;
Douglas et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2005; Meek
et al., 2007). IR-induced Ser2056 phosphorylation is mediated
by DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation, as it is significantly re-
duced in a kinase-dead mutant DNA-PKcs and is inhibited by
the DNA-PKcs kinase inhibitor (Chen et al., 2005). In contrast,
DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at the Thr2609 cluster is depen-
dent on ATM and ATR kinases in response to IR and UV radia-
tion, respectively (Yajima et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007).
DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at either the Thr2609 cluster or at
Ser2056 does not affect its kinase activity; nevertheless, abroga-
tion of DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at either region attenuates
DSB repair and leads to increased radiosensitivity (Chan et al.,
2002; Ding et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2005, 2007).
To gain insight into the physiological significance of phos-
phorylation at this cluster, we have generated a 3A knockin
mouse model, in which the three threonine residues are substi-
tuted with alanines. In this study, we report that DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice surprisingly develop congenital hematopoietic failure
caused by rapid loss of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the
developing fetal liver. This severe hematopoietic phenotype was
attributed to a compound deficiency in DSB repair, including the
HR and Fanconi anemia (FA) pathways. Because being defective
in NHEJ alone does not block HSC expansion in the embryo, we
conclude that the HR/FA pathways are essential for HSC devel-
opment and that DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at the Thr2609
cluster is a prerequisite for the pathway switch favoring HR/FA.
Results
Generation of a DNA-PKcs3A
knockin
mouse model
Our knockin mouse model of DNA-PKcs harbors three alanine
substitutions at Thr2605, Thr2634, and Thr2643 (3A mutation,
corresponding to human Thr2609, Thr2638, and Thr2647) of the
endogenous mouse DNA-PKcs or PRKDC gene locus (Fig. 1 A).
The design of the 3A knockin targeting vector was based on a
previously described self-excision ACN (testes-specific angio-
tensin-converting enzyme [tACE]–Cre/neomycin [Neo]) cassette

297Hematopoietic failure in DNA-PKcs mutant mice • Zhang et al.
(Gao et al., 1998; Taccioli et al., 1998; Kurimasa et al., 1999).
Like DNA-PKcs/
mice, the number of lymphocytes and the
size of lymphoid organs were drastically attenuated in 2-wk-old
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice (Fig. 2 A and Fig. S2 A). In contrast to the
early T cell development block at the CD4
CD8
double-negative
stage in DNA-PKcs–null mice (Gao et al., 1998; Kurimasa et al.,
1999), DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice have CD4+
CD8+
, CD4+
CD8
, and
CD4
CD8+
thymocytes, although at significantly reduced
numbers (Fig. 2, A and B). Analyses of thymocyte subsets also
reveal a severe reduction of DNA-PKcs3A/3A
double-negative
thymocytes at different developmental stages (Fig. S2 B).
Moreover, there is a significant reduction in the numbers of
T cells expressing TCR-/ (Fig. S2 C) and TCR- (Fig. S2 D),
which is observed in mice with mutations that cause a subtotal
block in V(D)J recombination (Difilippantonio et al., 2008).
Nevertheless, single-positive splenic T cells accumulated in the
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
spleen (Fig. 2 C). B cell development in DNA-
PKcs3A/3A
mice was also dramatically affected, with an appar-
ent arrest at the B220low
CD43+
IgM
(pro-B cell) stage in bone
marrow and few mature B cells in the spleen (Fig. 2 D), which
is similar to the defective B cell development in DNA-PKcs/
mice (Gao et al., 1998; Taccioli et al., 1998; Kurimasa et al.,
1999). Significant loss of nucleotides is a hallmark of coding
joint formation in DNA-PKcs–deficient mice, and we find that
the extent of nucleotide loss during coding joint formation in
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
thymocytes is similar to that observed in
DNA-PKcs–deficient (SCID) thymocytes (Fig. 2 E, Fig. S2 E,
Table S1, Table S2, and Table S3). Thus, phosphorylation
of the Thr2605 cluster in DNA-PKcs is required for normal
V(D)J recombination.
the one remaining loxP site between exon 58 and exon 59 did
not affect the expression of the 3A mutant DNA-PKcs from the
targeted allele, as similar levels of the DNA-PKcs protein were
detected in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from
all genotypes (Fig. 1 C). The 3A substitution also did not affect
the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs (Fig. S1 D) as previously
reported (Ding et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2007). Nonetheless,
clonogenic survival analysis revealed that DNA-PKcs3A/3A
MEFs
were hypersensitive to IR to a similar degree as DNA-PKcs–null
MEFs (Fig. 1 D).
Complete disruption of the mouse DNA-PKcs gene results
in an SCID phenotype (Gao et al., 1998; Taccioli et al., 1998;
Kurimasa et al., 1999), but in contrast to Ku-deficient mice,
there is no apparent growth retardation, infertility, or life short-
ening in DNA-PKcs/
mice (Nussenzweig et al., 1996; Gu
et al., 1997; Ouyang et al., 1997). Homozygous DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequency with simi-
lar body weight to littermates, but they became apparently
smaller within 2–3 wk of age (Fig. S1 C). In striking contrast to
the normal life span of control, heterozygous littermates, and
DNA-PKcs/
mice, the great majority of DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice
died shortly after birth (Fig. 1 E). In a cohort of 56 DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice, 75% died within 4 wk of birth, and only one mouse sur-
vived >12 wk.

difference was found in wild type, DNA-PKcs+/3A
mice (Fig. 3 E),
or in DNA-PKcs/
mice (Fig. 3 D). These results demonstrate
that there is an impaired maintenance or self-renewal of bone
marrow HSCs in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice and that the initiation
of HSC pathogenesis occurs during embryonic development.
Importantly, this dramatic early HSC failure has not been ob-
served in other NHEJ-deficient mouse strains, in which HSC
reserves are generally preserved in young mice (Nijnik et al.,
2007; Rossi et al., 2007).
Fetal liver HSC dysfunction and loss in
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice
The fetal liver is known to be the main source of hematopoiesis
during embryonic development, as it provides supportive niches
for HSC expansion and maturation (Mikkola and Orkin, 2006).
To determine when HSC homeostasis dysfunction occurred in
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
embryos, fetal liver samples from different de-
velopmental stages were harvested and analyzed. Flow cyto-
metric analysis revealed a decreased number of fetal liver LSK
cells in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
embryos at embryonic day (E) 14.5
(0.08 ± 0.04% vs. wild type 0.19 ± 0.06%) and E.16.5 (0.05 ±
0.02% vs. wild type 0.14 ± 0.02%; Fig. 4, A and B). At E12.5,
the LSK cell population in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
embryos was
slightly reduced (0.23 ± 0.10%) but remained within the nor-
mal range of wild-type embryos (0.26 ± 0.11%; Fig. 4 B). Sig-
nificantly, the depletion of HSC reserves in the DNA-PKcs3A/3A
fetal liver occurs when HSCs are highly proliferative and
undergo rapid expansion (Mikkola and Orkin, 2006). To examine
whether the HSC loss in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice was a result of
defective cell proliferation, freshly isolated fetal liver LSK
cells were cultured for ex vivo expansion. Wild-type and DNA-
PKcs+/3A
LSK cells proliferated exponentially and continuously
during the course of ex vivo expansion, whereas DNA-PKcs3A/3A
LSK cells proliferated normally only in the first 24 h (Fig. 4 C).
The expansion of DNA-PKcs3A/3A
LSK cells slowed down at 48 h
and then collapsed at 72 h as a result of massive cell death (un-
published data).
Congenital bone marrow failure and HSC
loss in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice
Although lymphocyte development is compromised in DNA-
PKcs3A/3A
mice, this would not be expected to cause early post-
natal lethality in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice, as SCID mice live a
normal life span. Examination of forward angle versus side
angle light scatter plots in bone marrow revealed not only a deple-
tion of cells in the lymphocyte gate (as in SCID mice) but also
a lack of cells in the granulocyte and macrophage gate in DNA-
PKcs3A/3A
bone marrow with a characteristically high level of
side scatter, suggesting a more general loss of leukocytes (Fig. 2 F).
During our investigation, we noticed that the ears, paws, and
internal organs of DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice were pale, suggesting the
development of anemia. A complete peripheral blood cell count
in 2-wk-old mice revealed a significant reduction in the num-
bers of WBCs, RBCs, and platelets in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice,
suggesting the development of multilineage peripheral blood
cytopenia (Table S4). Analysis of peripheral blood samples
taken at different time points showed that pancytopenia in DNA-
PKcs3A/3A
mice began 2 wk after birth and worsened with age
(Fig. 3, A and B). Consistent with the pancytopenia phenotype,
the average number of bone marrow–nucleated cells in 2-wk-
old DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice was significantly reduced (Fig. 3 C).
These results suggest that depletion of bone marrow–nucleated
cells in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice leads to pancytopenia, which has
not been observed in DNA-PKcs/
or SCID mice.
Peripheral blood cells are continuously replenished from
HSC pools in hematopoietic organs, particularly in postnatal
bone marrow (Kondo et al., 2003). To examine whether a defect
in HSC homeostasis was the cause of bone marrow depletion in
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice, a population of bone marrow HSCs
(Lin
Sca-1+
c-Kit+
, hereafter referred to as LSK cells) was eval-
uated by flow cytometric analysis (Morrison et al., 1995). The
experiments revealed that bone marrow LSK cells and their de-
rivative Lin

progenitor cells were almost ablated
in 2-wk-old DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice and were 100 times less than
wild type even at day 1 (Fig. 3, D and E), whereas no significant

299Hematopoietic failure in DNA-PKcs mutant mice • Zhang et al.
performed in irradiated CD45.1-recipient mice transplanted
with fetal liver LSK cells from wild-type or DNA-PKcs3A/3A
embryos (CD45.2 background) as well as the competing wild-type
CD45.1 bone marrow cells. As shown in Fig. 4 F, DNA-PKcs3A/3A
fetal liver LSKs were completely unable to repopulate in vivo,
demonstrating the severity of hematopoietic impairment in
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice. In contrast, bone marrow cells from
8-mo-old DNA-PKcs/
mice retained the reconstitution abil-
ity, though with a reduced potential compared with age-matched
wild-type bone marrow cells (Fig. 4 G), suggesting a possible
age-associated defect in hematopoiesis in DNA-PKcs/
mice
as also observed in other NHEJ-defective mice (Nijnik et al.,
2007; Rossi et al., 2007).
Increase of spontaneous DNA lesions
and apoptosis in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
fetal
liver HSCs
Based on our results, we hypothesized that the 3A mutant DNA-
PKcs might interfere with endogenous DSB repair, resulting in
an increase of spontaneous DNA lesions and cell death. To in-
vestigate this possibility, freshly isolated LSK cells from E12.5
fetal livers were stained for -H2AX nuclear foci, a commonly
used surrogate marker of DSB formation. LSK cells isolated
from wild-type and heterozygotic embryos rarely displayed
-H2AX foci, and no more than five -H2AX foci were ob-
served in individual wild-type cells, whereas the majority of
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
LSK cells were positively stained with -H2AX,
and >30% contained more than five -H2AX foci (Fig. 5 A).
In addition, a single-cell comet assay performed under alka-
line conditions also revealed that a significant portion of DNA-
PKcs3A/3A
LSK cells contained the comet tail as compared
with that of wild-type and heterozygotic LSK cells (Fig. S4 A).
Consistent with the induction of spontaneous DNA lesions, an
Bone marrow transplantation rescues
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice
Defective HSC expansion in fetal liver and depletion of nucle-
ated cells in postnatal bone marrow suggest that HSC failure
might be the cause of early lethality in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice. To
test this hypothesis, bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was
performed in 2-wk-old DNA-PKcs3A/3A
–recipient mice using
wild-type littermates as donors. BMT was performed without
preconditioning procedures because DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice are
highly sensitive to radiation treatment (unpublished data) and
are immunoincompetent. After transplantation with wild-type
bone marrow cells, DNA-PKcs3A/3A
recipients had an 80% sur-
vival rate at 2 mo and 60% at 1 yr (Fig. 4 D). BMT-rescued
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice gained weight normally compared with
their heterozygotic littermates (Fig. S3 B). 8 wk after transplan-
tation, peripheral blood cell counts in recipient mice showed a
complete recovery from pancytopenia and the restoration of the
bone marrow HSC pool (Fig. S3 A). Importantly, PCR genotyp-
ing revealed that hematopoietic organs in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
recipients were reconstituted primarily by wild-type donor cells
(Fig. 4 E), indicating a successful hematopoietic reconstitution.
The rescue of DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice could also be achieved by
transplantation with bone marrow LSK cells from wild-type
littermates with a reduced efficiency (Fig. 4 D), as the LSK fac-
tion primarily contains the upstream HSCs. In contrast, bone
marrow contains HSCs, progenitors, and partially differentiated
progenitors for different hematopoietic lineages and is able to
achieve a significant rescue within a shorter window of oppor-
tunity than LSKs.
The success of BMT rescue confirmed that HSC failure is
the main cause of early lethality in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice. To de-
termine whether there is an intrinsic defect of DNA-PKcs3A/3A
HSC proliferation in vivo, competitive repopulating assays were

bone marrow (Fig. 5 F) but restored to a lesser degree in the
spleen (Fig. 5 G). Furthermore, even with the loss of a single
p53 gene, the numbers of B cells were partially rescued. There
were very few B220+
IgM+
mature B cells in the 3A/p53+/+
bone
marrow, but these cells were clearly detectable in 3A/p53/
mice (Fig. S4 C). Thus, in contrast to DNA-PKcs–deficient
SCID mice in which loss of p53 does not rescue B cell develop-
ment (Nacht et al., 1996), there is partial rescue of B lympho-
cytes in 3A/p53/
mice. This also suggests that the V(D)J
recombination defect in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice is less severe than
in the complete absence of DNA-PKcs.
Increase of genotoxic stress in the
intestinal crypt and epidermis
In addition to HSC loss, elevation of the p53-dependent geno-
toxic stress response in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice was also evident
in the intestinal crypt and epidermis. The intestinal crypt is the
proliferation compartment and contains intestine stem cells,
which give rise to different intestine epithelial cells for intesti-
nal homeostasis maintenance. Immunohistological analysis re-
vealed that a significant increase of TUNEL-positive cells was
found in the intestinal crypt of DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice and that the
p53-null mutation alleviated the defect completely (Fig. 6A). Skin
hyperpigmentation is another example of a p53-dependent
stress response (McGowan et al., 2008) and can be found in the
footpad and tail of DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice (Fig. 6, B and C). As
expected, the hyperpigmentation phenotype is completely re-
versed in 3A/p53/
mice. Footpad hyperpigmentation became
apparent in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice as early as 1 wk after birth and
increase of Annexin V staining was also confirmed in freshly
isolated fetal liver LSK cells from DNA-PKcs3A/3A
embryos
(Fig. 5 B), suggesting that HSC loss in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice is
likely caused by excessive apoptotic cell death.
Loss of p53 mitigates the stem cell
failure and promotes survival in
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice
To examine whether HSC loss is caused by p53-mediated apop-
totic response, DNA-PKcs3A
mice were crossed with p53-null
mutant mice. Loss of both p53 alleles doubled the life span of
homozygotic DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice (abbreviated as 3A; Fig. 5 C)
and restored long-term HSCs (Lin
Sca-1+
c-Kit+
Flt3
CD34
) in
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice (Fig. 5 D). Strikingly, loss of a single copy
of p53 also prolonged the survival of 3A/p53+/
mice. In a cohort
of 22 3A/p53+/
mice, 50% survived beyond 8 wk, which is
significantly longer (P < 0.001) than the survival of 3A mice.
Despite the enhanced survival, there was still a major depletion
of bone marrow stem cells in 3A/p53+/
mice. We estimate from
two femur bones that there are 4.2 × 103
LSK cells in 3A/p53+/
mice compared with 2.9 × 105
LSK cells in wild-type mice.
In addition to life-span extension, a p53-null mutation
also alleviated the developmental defect of lymphocytes in
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice. Thymocyte cell numbers were partially
rescued (60% of wild-type mice) in 3A/p53/
mice but not in
3A/p53+/
mice (Fig. 5 E), and the distribution of CD4 versus
CD8 cells was normalized in 3A/p53/
thymocytes (Fig. S4 B).
The rescue of B cell development was also obvious, as the num-
bers of B cells in 3A/p53/
mice were completely normal in

revealed that FANCD2 monoubiquitination was attenuated in
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
MEFs in response to IR and MMC (Fig. 7 C and
Fig. S5 D) but was not ablated as observed in FANCA/
MEFs
(Fig. S5 E). This attenuation is not likely caused by a reduced
S-phase population in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
MEFs, as no clear differ-
ence exists in cell cycle redistribution between wild-type and
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
MEFs (Fig. S5 C). Activated FANCD2 is re-
cruited to chromatin and forms nuclear foci where it facilitates
HR and interstrand cross-link repair (Garcia-Higuera et al., 2001).
In response to IR treatment, FANCD2 foci formation was de-
tected in wild-type cells as early as 20 min after irradiation
(unpublished data), and the percentage of cells with FANCD2
foci increases with time (Fig. 7 D). In contrast, FANCD2 foci in
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
MEFs appeared with delayed kinetics, and the
percentage of cells with foci was 50% of wild-type MEFs at
various time points after IR. A similar defect was detected in the
formation of Rad51 nuclear foci (Fig. S5 F), a prerequisite of
HR-mediated DNA repair (Haaf et al., 1995). Formation of
Rad51 foci was attenuated in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
MEFs but was en-
hanced in DNA-PKcs/
MEFs, which is likely because of the
elevation of HR activity in the absence of NHEJ (Allen et al.,
2002). Finally, we analyzed HR activity using the direct repeat
(DR)–GFP reporter approach (Pierce et al., 1999). MEFs with a
single integration of the DR-GFP reporter were transfected with
an ISceI- glucocorticoid receptor (GR)–RFP construct to induce
DSB formation and HR reaction (Soutoglou et al., 2007). Our
result revealed that HR activity was attenuated in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
MEFs, and a significant portion of ISceI-GR-RFP–expressing
(RFP+
) DNA-PKcs3A/3A
cells was GFP
(no recombination) as
compared with wild-type MEFs (Fig. 7 E). In contrast, HR activ-
ity was further enhanced in DNA-PKcs/
MEFs because of a
lack of NHEJ activity. The negative impact of the DNA-PKcs3A
mutant on the HR/FA responses thus provides an explanation for
the phenotypical difference between DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice and
DNA-PKcs–null mice.
Discussion
The self-renewal property of HSCs and their ability to sustain
long-term hematopoiesis require that genome integrity is strictly
maintained (Kenyon and Gerson, 2007; Niedernhofer, 2008).
It is well characterized that hematopoietic cells are highly sensi-
tive to radiation-induced DNA damage, and bone marrow aplasia
is one of main causes for radiation-induced lethality. A recent
study showed that HSCs, but not progenitor cells, are preferen-
tially killed by radiation, suggesting that HSCs are among the
most sensitive cell types to DNA damage (Wang et al., 2006).
HSCs in DNA repair-deficient individuals are highly suscepti-
ble to various kinds of genotoxic stresses. Genetically modified
mouse models also revealed that defects in the DNA damage
response result in the dysfunction of HSC maintenance. Hema-
topoietic failure with an early development of bone marrow hypo­
cellularity is manifested in mice with a hypomorphic mutation
of Rad50 (Rad50S/S
; Bender et al., 2002) and mice knockout of
ERCC1, a key factor in nucleotide excision repair and inter-
strand cross-link repair (Niedernhofer et al., 2004; Prasher et al.,
2005). Deficiency of ATM leads to elevated levels of oxidative
was further darkened with age. In contrast, there was no footpad
pigmentation in wild-type and heterozygotic pups, whereas
mild footpad pigmentation could also be found in older (>2 mo)
heterozygotic mice (unpublished data).
Hypersensitivity of DNA-PKcs3A/3A
MEFs
to DNA cross-linking agents
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
MEFs exhibit a similar radiosensitivity to
DNA-PKcs/
MEFs and defective V(D)J recombination, yet
only in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice is there a block in hematopoiesis
and an activation of the p53 pathway. Thus, there are likely to be
defects in addition to impaired NHEJ. To test this possibility,
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
MEFs were subjected to different DNA dam-
age agents (Fig. 7 A and Fig. S5 A). Clonogenic survival analy-
ses revealed that DNA-PKcs3A/3A
MEFs displayed a greater
sensitivity toward replication stress inducers, including UV
irradiation, camptothecin, and mitomycin C (MMC; Fig. 7 A).
The most striking difference came from treatment with the DNA
cross-linking agent MMC, as clonogenic survival of DNA-
PKcs3A/3A
MEFs was dramatically reduced, whereas hetero­
zygotic MEFs and, importantly, DNA-PKcs/
MEFs were not
affected. Furthermore, MMC treatment induced a significant
increase in chromosome aberrations in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
MEFs
(Fig. 7 B), among which radial structures were frequently ob-
served (Fig. S5 B).
Hypersensitivity toward DNA cross-linking agents and
bone marrow failure are the hallmarks of the inherited human
disease FA. The repair of DNA interstrand cross-links is a com-
plex process that involves the FA complex and the HR pathway
(Mirchandani and D’Andrea, 2006). To determine whether the
FA pathway was affected, we analyzed the induction of FANCD2
monoubiquitination in response to DNA damage. Immunoblotting

DSBs are among the most dangerous types of DNA lesions
and pose a great challenge to cellular survival and genome
integrity maintenance. Multiple repair mechanisms, including
NHEJ, HR, and additional backup pathways, have evolved to
ensure that DSBs are promptly and properly eliminated from
the genome. Outside V(D)J recombination events, endogenous
DSBs occur primarily in the cycling cells though the conversion of
single-strand lesions during replication (Vilenchik and Knudson,
2003). From the standpoint of endogenous DSB production,
we could assume that DNA-PK and its downstream NHEJ
pathway, which is the predominant DSB repair mechanism in
mammalian cells and is operational in all cell cycle phases, have
a greater involvement in the replication-associated DNA damage
response than we previously thought. However, it is not clear
how DNA-PKcs and other factors of DSB repair are coordi-
nated in response to replicative stresses, particularly in the
highly proliferative cell population. Our unexpected findings
from the DNA-PKcs3A
mouse model provide strong evidence
that the impact of DNA-PKcs, particularly its phosphorylation at
the mouse Thr2605 cluster (human Thr2609), has a role beyond
the NHEJ mechanism.
It recently became clear that the competition between the
NHEJ and the HR/FA pathway has important biological signifi-
cance. For example, loss of the NHEJ factor 53BP1 alleviates
stress and a progressive loss of the HSC pool with age (Ito
et al., 2004). Similarly, NHEJ deficiency in Ku80 knockout
mice diminishes HSC self-renewal capacity, whereas hypo-
morphic Lig4Y288C
mice display an age-dependent decrease in
HSC numbers and bone marrow cellularity (Nijnik et al., 2007;
Rossi et al., 2007). In contrast, HSC loss in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice occurs significantly earlier during embryonic develop-
ment, which resembles Rad50S/S
and ERCC1/
models,
though it is not clear whether there is a functional overlap be-
tween the DNA-PKcs3A
mutant protein and these two DNA re-
pair factors in terms of HSC maintenance. On the other hand,
complete DNA-PKcs deficiency leads to a decrease in HSC
number (unpublished data) and repopulating ability in aged
DNA-PKcs knockout mice. The distinct phenotypes in HSC
maintenance between DNA-PKcs knockout and knockin mice
is likely a result of their difference in DSB repair capacity, as
DNA-PKcs3A/3A
cells are also defective in the HR/FA responses
in addition to the diminished NHEJ activity. Thus, the com-
bined deficiency in DSB repair renders DNA-PKcs3A/3A
cells
hypersensitive to MMC and other replication stress agents. It is
conceivable that the HR/FA mechanism, but not the NHEJ, is
essential for replication-associated DNA damage repair and is
critical for the rapid expansion of HSC populations in develop-
ing fetal liver.

to the loss of stem cells in bone marrow (Kennedy and D’Andrea,
2005; Rani et al., 2008). It is interesting to note that the human
dyskeratosis congenita syndrome, which is caused by telomerase
mutations, also displays bone marrow failure and hyper skin pig-
mentation characters. Conversely, mice with combined mutations
on telomerase and Pot1b, a component of the telomere-protecting
shelterin complex, exhibit dyskeratosis congenita–like character-
istics, including bone marrow failure and footpad hyperpigmen-
tation (Hockemeyer et al., 2008; He et al., 2009). This similarity
to DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice suggests a common stress response
among different congenital bone marrow failure diseases and war-
rants further investigation of DNA-PKcs phosphorylation on
telomere maintenance.
Materials and methods
Construction of the targeting vector and generation of DNA-PKcs3A/3A
knockin mice
The 3A knockin targeting vector was constructed using a previously described
self-excision gene-targeting approach (Bunting et al., 1999). The DNA-PKcs3A
mice were maintained in the mixed genetic background of 129× C57BL/6
and were bred with p53-null mice in an FVB background. ES cell targeting
and generation of chimeric mice were performed at the transgenic core facility
at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. All animal experimen-
tal protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University
of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.
Clonogenic survival and chromosomal aberrations
Primary and SV40-transformed MEFs from E13.5 embryos were cultured in 
minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and peni-
cillin/streptomycin. MEFs were maintained in a 37°C humidified atmosphere
with 3% O2 and 10% CO2. For clonogenic survival, SV40-transformed MEFs
were treated with different doses of mutagens and were trypsinized/reseeded
in appropriate numbers in 10-cm tissue-culture dishes for 7 d. For chromo-
somal aberrations, primary MEFs (passages 2–5) were incubated with
40 nM MMC for 24 h and 0.1 mg/ml colcemid in the last 2 h.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and ex vivo expansion of HSCs
Thymus, bone marrow, or fetal liver single-cell suspensions were stained
with the indicated antibodies and analyzed using either a FACSCalibur
(BD) or LSRII (BD) flow cytometer (Huynh et al., 2008). HSCs were sorted
using a flow cytometer (FACSAria; BD) essentially as previously described
(Huynh et al., 2008). For apoptosis analysis, cell suspensions were stained
with phycoerythrin-anti–Annexin V (BD). Ex vivo expansion of fetal liver
HSCs was performed using a previously published protocol (Zhang and
Lodish, 2004).
V(D)J recombination assay
D2:J1 coding joint junctions were PCR amplified from total thymocyte
DNA using a nested amplification protocol. The PCR conditions and primer
design are detailed in Fig. S2.
Bone marrow/HSC transplantation and competitive repopulating assay
Total bone marrow cells (5 × 105
) or Lin
Sca-1+
c-Kit+
cells (1,500–5,000)
from wild-type littermates were injected into the retro-orbital plexus of 2- or
3-wk-old DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice without preconditioning. Competitive repopu­
lation was performed using wild-type, DNA-PKcs3A/3A
, or DNA-PKcs/
cells (CD45.2 background), mixed with competitive bone marrow cells
from B6-LY5.2/Cr mice (CD45.1 background), and injected into lethally ir-
radiated (5 Gy × 2) B6-LY5.2/Cr–recipient mice. 2 mo after injection,
populations of CD45.1+
and CD45.2+
peripheral blood cells were ana-
lyzed by flow cytometry.
DR-GFP HR assay
SV40-transformed MEFs with single-copy incorporation of the DR-GFP re-
porter (Pierce et al., 1999) were transfected with the ISceI-GR-RFP plasmid
(Addgene) and treated with 10 nM triamcinolone acetonide for 24 h fol-
lowed by flow cytometry analysis. HR activities were determined by the
percentage of GFP+

double-positive cells among all ISceI-GR-RFP–
expressing (RFP+
) cells.
the hypersensitivity of HR-defective Brca1 mutant cells to
DNA-damaging agents and restores DSB repair by HR (Bouwman
et al., 2010; Bunting et al., 2010). In addition, the FA pathway
plays a critical role in eliminating toxic NHEJ; suppression of
NHEJ alleviates the sensitivity of FA mutant cells to DNA cross-
linking agents and facilitates error-free repair by HR (Adamo
et al., 2010; Pace et al., 2010). Similarly, our data suggest that
the DNA-PKcs3A
mutant protein interferes with the HR path-
way, which could explain the sensitivity to replication damage
and the severity of hematopoietic failure.
We have previously reported that the human Thr2609 cluster
is phosphorylated directly by the ATR kinase upon replication
stress (Yajima et al., 2006). This ATR-dependent DNA-PKcs
phosphorylation virtually facilitates processing of replication-
associated DNA lesions through the HR/FA machinery. It is likely
that, in such a repair process, the shift from error-prone end joining
to faithful repair by the HR/FA is partially achieved by ATR-
dependent DNA-PKcs phosphorylation. In support of this, a simi-
lar stem cell defect was observed in conditional ATR knockout
mice (Ruzankina et al., 2007). It is not clear yet how DNA-PKcs
phosphorylation at the Thr2609 cluster promotes HR/FA activities.
One possible explanation is that Thr2609 cluster phosphorylation
changes the conformation of DSB-bound DNA-PKcs and releases
DSB ends to the HR/FA machineries (Meek et al., 2008).
The loss of HSCs in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice is primarily
caused by p53-mediated apoptotic response, as the p53-null
mutation reinstates HSC reserves in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice. In
addition to HSC loss, elevation of genotoxic stress and p53 acti-
vation was found in other proliferating tissues as evident from
intestinal crypt cell apoptosis and epidermal hyperpigmenta-
tion. These results reiterate that DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at
the human Thr2609/mouse Thr2605 cluster is critical for repli-
cation stress response and the maintenance of tissue homeosta-
sis. The tissue-specific outcome of genotoxic stress imposed by
the DNA-PKcs3A
mutant protein or DNA-PKcs dysfunction
may depend on cell type–specific apoptosis/senescence and the
compensation capacity from varied sizes of stem cell pools in
different tissues and organs.
Gene mutations in the FA protein complex and HR compo-
nents have been indentified in human FA syndrome character-
ized by congenital bone marrow failure, short stature, abnormal
skin pigmentation, reduced fertility, hypersensitivity toward DNA
cross-link damages, and increased genomic instability (Moldovan
and D’Andrea, 2009). The mechanism underlying the clinical
findings of FA remains unclear, given the fact that none of the
current mouse models for HR and FA systematically recapitu-
lated these pathophysiological changes. It is interesting to note
that the DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mouse resembles human FA syndromes
more than FA mouse models. The hallmarks of FA, including
aplastic anemia, abnormal skin pigmentation, MMC sensitivity,
and radial chromosome formation with MMC treatment, are all
observed in DNA-PKcs3A/3A
mice, suggesting that, in human pa-
tients, FA mutations also likely affect the stem cell compartment
during embryo development and activate p53, which generates
pathological changes in multiple organs. Indeed, p53 has also
been shown to be up-regulated in FA cells, and it has been specu-
lated that the p53-dependent apoptotic pathway may contribute
