Abstract
DNA methylation constitutes the most stable type of epigenetic modifications modulating the
transcriptional plasticity of mammalian genomes. Using bisulfite DNA sequencing, we report
high-resolution methylation reference profiles of human chromosomes 6, 20 and 22, providing a
resource of about 1.9 million CpG methylation values derived from 12 different tissues. Analysis
of 6 annotation categories, revealed evolutionary conserved regions to be the predominant sites for
differential DNA methylation and a core region surrounding the transcriptional start site as
informative surrogate for promoter methylation. We find 17% of the 873 analyzed genes
differentially methylated in their 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTR) and about one third of the
differentially methylated 5′-UTRs to be inversely correlated with transcription. While our study
was controlled for factors reported to affect DNA methylation such as sex and age, we did not find
any significant attributable effects. Our data suggest DNA methylation to be ontogenetically more
stable than previously thought.
Introduction
The completion of the human genome project1,2 has created the basis to study how genetic
information is executed at the cellular level. Many of the processes involved are governed
by additional layers of epigenetic information that are not directly encoded by the DNA
sequence itself but by chemical modifications of the chromatin in form of DNA methylation
and histone modifications, collectively also referred to as the ‘epigenetic code’. Deciphering
the human epigenetic code will be a daunting task as it is encoded not in a single but many
different epigenomes (for review3,4).
Towards this goal, a blueprint for an international human epigenome project has recently
been proposed5 that recognizes the need to integrate already on-going epigenome projects.
One of these projects, termed the human epigenome project (HEP), aims to identify,
catalogue and interpret genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of all human genes in all
major tissues6. In mammals, DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively within the context

of CpG dinucleotides with an estimated 80% of all CpG sites being methylated. While array-
based approaches7,8,9 look promising for the future, bisulfite DNA sequencing10 remains
the gold-standard for high (base pair) resolution DNA methylation profiling of human
epigenome(s)6. Using this approach, we report here the methylation profiling of the human
chromosomes 6, 20 and 22 in 43 samples derived from 12 different (healthy) tissues.
Results
Following the HEP pilot study6, we sought to establish DNA methylation reference profiles
for three human chromosomes from a representative number of healthy (no known disease
phenotype) human tissues and primary cells. The study was controlled for two parameters
(age and sex) potentially influencing DNA methylation and comprised the analysis of 43
different samples derived from sperm, various primary cell types (dermal fibroblasts, dermal
keratinocytes, dermal melanocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes) and tissues (heart
muscle, skeletal muscle, liver and placenta). Tissues were pooled from up to three age- and
sex-matched individuals (see Supplementary table 1 for details). Primary cells were cultured
for no more than three passages to minimize the risk of introducing aberrant methylation.
Additionally, the methylation levels of selected amplicons were compared before and after
culturing and no difference in average methylation was detected.
Amplicons were designed to cover 6 distinct sequence categories (Fig. 1) based on the
Ensembl (NCBI34) annotation. CpG islands (CGIs) were not included as separate category
because they were present in multiple categories but were analysed separately where
indicated. In total, we analysed 2,524 amplicons on chromosomes 6, 20 and 22 (table1)
comprising coding, non-coding and evolutionary conserved sequences that are associated
with 873 genes. Taking the number of biological (Supplementary table 1) and technical (see
Materials and Methods) replicates into account, we have determined the methylation status
of 1.88 million CpG sites. The corresponding data have been deposited into the public HEP
database and can be accessed at www.epigenome.org. Supplementary Fig. 1 shows a global
view of the averaged methylation profiles of each tissue type for chromosomes 6, 20 and 22
and Fig. 2 (upper panel) shows a representative 1 Mb region on chromosome 22, illustrating
short- and long-range amplicon coverage within the context of gene and CpG island
annotation.
Distribution of methylation
In agreement with the results of the recently reported pilot study6, the majority of amplicons
essentially displayed a bimodal distribution with 27.4% of loci being unmethylated (<20%),
42.4% being hypermethylated (>80%) and 30.2% displaying heterogeneous (20-80%)
methylation. In agreement with previous studies (e.g.11,12,13), most of the CGIs were
unmethylated (Supplementary Fig. 2) and only a small fraction (9.2%) of CGIs were
hypermethylated. None of the CGIs with CpG densities greater than 10% were
hypermethylated. As methylated cytosines are susceptible to spontaneous deamination14, it
is conceivable that this level of CpG density might represent a threshold beyond which the
mutagenic burden becomes too high for the (epi)genetic status to be stably maintained.
From the heterogeneously methylated loci, we selected 14 random amplicons and one
control amplicon covering the imprinted GNAS115 locus to determine if the observed
heterogeneity was caused by differences between cells (mosaicism) or parent-of-origin,
allelic differences within cells (imprinting). Amplicons were subcloned and up to 20 clones
were sequenced. Imprinting was confirmed for GNAS1 and mosaicism was confirmed for
the rest. One amplicon worth noting in this context mapped to the 5′-UTR of SLC22A1, a
gene located within the imprinted cluster of IGF2R on chromosome 616,17 but allele-specific

methylation did not segregate with SNP rs1867351 (Supplementary Fig. 3), thus excluding
imprinting in this case. Based on this analysis, we conclude that the majority (>90%) of the
observed heterogeneous methylation is caused by mosaicism, although we cannot exclude
the additional possibility of heterogeneous tissue sampling.
Next, we investigated the relationship between the degree of methylation over distance (co-
methylation) and the difference in absolute methylation between tissues. Although a
significant correlation could be established for co-methylation over short (up to 1,000 bp)
distances, it deteriorated rapidly for distances larger than 2,000 bp (Fig. 3a). This finding
suggests that – under normal (non-disease situation) circumstances - the level of local co-
methylation is rather short-range as compared to long-range domains of homogenous
methylation reported in some disease situations18,19. To assess the absolute differences in
methylation between tissues we carried out pair-wise comparisons of all amplicons between
the respective tissues (Fig. 3b). Sperm clearly stood out displaying the highest difference
(e.g. up to 20% compared to fibroblasts and 10% compared to liver) while related tissues
and cell types like CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes displayed the lowest differences
(approximately 5%), consistent with their more similar gene expression profiles20. This
accentuates the extensive reprogramming spermatozoids undergo during gametogenesis.
Promoter methylation
Promoters are key targets for epigenetic modulation but their exact locations remain
unknown for most human genes. We therefore analysed three types of ‘promoter-proxy’
regions, including amplicons representative of the 5′-UTR in general and putative TSS and
Sp1 sites (both also part of the 5′-UTR). The 5′-UTR amplicons were further subdivided
according to CGI content and associated gene type (known gene, novel protein coding
sequence (novel CDS), pseudogene or novel transcript), based on the annotation available
from the vertebrate genome annotation (Vega) database21.
As expected, most (87.9%) of the CGI-containing 5′-UTR amplicons were unmethylated,
while 2.1% were hypermethylated (>80%) and the remaining 10% displayed heterogeneous
methylation(20-80%), Supplementary Fig. 4a, left panel). In contrast, almost 50% of the non
CGI-containing 5′-UTRs displayed hypermethylation (>80%, Supplementary Fig. 4a, right
panel) and only a minority (20.2%) were unmethylated (Supplementary Fig. 4a, left panel).
When filtered for associated gene type, the percentage of unmethylated 5′-UTRs (<20%)
was 56% for known genes, 53% for novel CDSs and about 12% for novel transcripts and
pseudogenes (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Methylation has been implicated before in
pseudogene silencing (e.g.13) and the methylation observed here for novel transcripts
indicates a similar fate for this category.
Transcription start sites (TSSs) can be predicted with good specificity22 and offer higher
spatial resolution than 5′-UTRs. Averaging of the methylation values of CpGs surrounding
TSSs revealed an unmethylated core region of about 1,000 bp, extending symmetrically
upstream and downstream of the TSS (Fig. 4). As unmethylated loci are generally associated
with open chromatin structure (e.g. reviewed in23), the methylation status of the identified
core region might reflect an open chromatin structure that extends downstream of the TSS.
For the analysis of individual transcription factor binding sites, we selected 94 amplicons
containing experimentally verified Sp1 binding sites on chromosome 22 that were
previously identified by Cawley et al.24. Of these, 46 were selected to be TSS-associated
(within +/− 1,000 bp of a TSS) and 48 to be not TSS-associated (>1,000 bp away from
nearest TSS). Averaging the methylation values for each of the 94 amplicons over all 43
samples, revealed that 31% were hypermethylated (>80%), 25% were heterogeneously
methylated (20-80%) and 44% were unmethylated (<20%), indicating that Sp1 binding

EuropePMCFundersAuthorManuscriptsEuropePMCFundersAuthorManuscripts
might be independent of methylation. However, if amplicons were filtered for TSS
association, very different ratios of hyper:heterogeneous:no methylation emerged: 9:11:80%
for TSS-associated compared to 52:40:8% for non TSS-associated amplicons. Similarly,
averaging over individual CpG sites revealed that 76% of all TSS-associated CpGs were
unmethylated (<20%) compared to only 14% when not TSS-associated (Fig. 4, blue dots).
To investigate this further, we correlated amplicon methylation with the presence/absence of
a known Sp1 motif (Sp1_Q6) extracted from the TRANSFAC database and found a
significant correlation (p=0.017), e.g. amplicons with the 25 highest motif scores are less
likely to have high methylation scores. Taken together, these findings bestow highest
confidence for Sp1 binding to occur at unmethylated and TSS-associated Sp1 sites but do
not exclude the possibility of Sp1 binding at hypermethylated and/or non TSS-associated
sites. In some model systems, Sp1 binding has been shown to be abolished by site-specific
methylation25,26, while in other systems it appears methylation independent27,28. A direct
comparison with the Cawley et al. data is not possible as this study used cell lines and,
therefore, the methylation at the respective amplicons could be different from the one we
have observed in our samples.
Age- and sex-dependent DNA methylation
DNA methylation is influenced by a number of endogenous and exogenous parameters3.
Here, we have analysed our data for potential differences associated with age and sex. For a
number of different tissues (liver, skeletal muscle, heart muscle) we examined samples
obtained from two age groups, one group having a mean age of 26 (SD +/− 4) years and the
second group having a mean age of 68 (SD +/− 8) years. By averaging the methylation
difference of all CpGs analyzed for the two age groups, we identified a mean methylation
difference of only 0.275% between these two age groups (Fig. 5, red line) and a difference
of 0.1% between males and females (Fig. 5, yellow line). These differences are unlikely to
be significant as 10,000-fold re-sampling of the corresponding data showed similar or larger
differences in these random cases (Fig. 5, grey area). In contrast, by comparing the average
methylation between different cell types (Fig. 5, blue line), we detected highly significant
differences between e.g. CD4+ lymphocytes and dermal fibroblasts (7.1%) and between
skeletal muscle and liver (4.0%).
While the above analysis of all CpGs has power to detect global changes in average
methylation levels, it might be less suitable to identify specific loci showing a correlation of
methylation with age. We therefore re-analysed each amplicon in our data set to identify
age-correlated differential methylation at individual loci. This approach also allowed to
detect differences smaller than 50% but, again, no locus displayed differential methylation
that reached statistical significance (p<0.05).
Similarly, we compared samples from the same age group but differing in sex to identify
putative non X-chromosomal changes in methylation. Conducting both a global and
candidate amplicon analysis, we did not detect any significant methylation changes
associated with sex. As a positive control, we confirmed differential 5′-UTR methylation of
ELK1, a X-chromosomal gene that is differentially methylated displaying 50% and 0%
methylation respectively in female and male samples. The absence of both, global and locus-
specific changes in age- and sex-correlated methylation in our data set suggests that, in
healthy individuals, such alterations are limited to specific loci and tissues. A potential
caveat of all age-correlated methylation studies (including ours) is the possible heterogeneity
of tissue samples that have an inherent higher degree of heterogeneity than primary cells due
to the different cell-types constituting a given tissue which in turn determines the average
level of DNA methylation. In the present study, we pooled DNA samples in order to
minimize errors introduced by heterogeneous tissue sampling. It is conceivable that some

tissues, e.g. those more exposed to environmental conditions such as lung and colon, will
show a stronger correlation between methylation and age. A recent study performed in
monozygotic twins detected epigenetic differences in the overall content and distribution of
5-methylcytosine and histone acetylation that arose in older twins29 and it is possible that
age-related methylation alterations might be too subtle to be detectable on a genome-wide
scale against the heterogeneous genetic background of the used samples and/or the method
used.
Differential methylation
It is believed that tissue-specific transcription is, in part, controlled by tissue-specific
differentially methylated regions (T-DMRs). T-DMRs are likely to be important regulatory
elements that are essential for specifying tissue type identity in mammals, however, we are
currently aware of a handful, mostly CGI-associated T-DMRs in a few tissues only (for
review see30). Hierarchical clustering of our data revealed that biological replicates of each
tissue type clustered together (Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating the presence of tissue-
specific methylation profiles. Approximately 22% of the amplicons were T-DMRs (p <
0.001; table S2). These were located within 5′-UTRs, exons, and introns of functionally
diverse genes (Fig. 2, lower panel for examples; Supplementary table 2). Within the 5′-
UTR, T-DMRs located within a CGI (Supplementary Fig. 6) were strongly underrepresented
(13% vs. 87%, χ2 test, p <0.001). The comparatively low frequency of CGI-associated T-
DMRs is consistent with previous reports using restriction landmark genome scanning
(RLGS)31,32. We also identified a number of amplicons (JAG1, Supplementary table 2) that
were differentially methylated in fetal tissues when compared to their adult counterparts,
emphasizing the importance of epigenetic mechanisms during mammalian development.
Interestingly, T-DMRs were also found to be associated with both unprocessed and
processed pseudogenes (e.g. CMHA and AC000078.2-002, respectively), and evolutionary
conserved, non-protein coding regions (ECRs). In fact, we found T-DMRs are strongly over-
represented in ECRs (χ2 test, p <0.005) and 30% of all examined ECRs were T-DMRs
compared to a T-DMR frequency of 17% identified in 5′-UTRs and exons (Fig. 6a). Some
of the T-DMR ECRs were located up to 100 kb away from the nearest annotated gene which
is consistent with putative long-range regulatory effects associated with enhancer or silencer
function but, on the other hand, could also indicate the presence of as yet unkown genes.
These findings support the notion that T-DMRs may play a functional role beyond the mere
control of transcription via promoter methylation. For instance, comparative analysis of the
mouse IL4 locus identified two ECRs that undergo differential methylation during
differentiation from naïve CD4 to TH1 and TH2 cells and can act as enhancers for IL4
expression (reviewed in33).
Transcriptional silencing by promoter methylation is one of the major mechanisms for
tumour suppressor gene silencing and neoplastic transformation34. Few genes have been
found to be regulated by promoter methylation in healthy tissues35 with one example being
SERPINB536 where 5′-UTR methylation correlates with the silencing of mRNA expression.
We randomly selected 43 genes associated with 5′-UTR T-DMRs and 10 genes that
contained T-DMRs within the gene, and determined mRNA expression by reverse
transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Of the 5′-UTR T-DMRs, the methylation state did not
correlate with mRNA expression levels for 63% of the genes and inversely correlated for
37% (examples for both scenarios are shown in Fig. 6b). Interestingly, genes without a CGI
in their respective 5′-UTRs (e.g. oncostatin (OSM), fig 2, fig. 6b) also displayed an inverse
correlation, indicating that genes with a low CpG density might be subject to transcriptional
regulation via DNA methylation as well. None of the T-DMRs located within genes
displayed a correlation with expression of the cognate mRNA. These observations suggest
that differential 5′-UTR methylation might only play a permissive role such as establishing
Eckhardt et al. Page 5

an open chromatin conformation in some cases. In this model, other additional factors, such
as transcription factors or histone modifications, would be missing to drive transcription.
Alternatively, the examined T-DMRs might not be located in the region that regulates
transcription.
Conservation of DNA methylation
The conservation of DNA sequences between species is well studied but much less is known
about cross-species conservation of DNA methylation. To determine, if and to what degree
DNA methylation is conserved between species, we compared the methylation profiles of 59
orthologous amplicons (as far as can be ascertained by conserved synteny and sequence
similarity) in four human and mouse tissues (skin, liver, heart muscle, skeletal muscle). The
amplicons were located either within 5′-UTRs or within ECRs. As shown in Fig. 7, the
majority (69.4%) of profiles were conserved (differing by less than 20%) in both amplicon
categories, e.g. in both species we observed methylation of about 90% in the 5′-UTR of
RIN2 in liver while other tissues were consistently unmethylated. Only 4.3% of the
orthologous loci differed by more than 60%, indicating that these amplicons were
differentially hyper- or unmethylated in the two species. One such example is the 5′-UTR
amplicon of gene Q6ZRW2 which was approximately 60% methylated in human and
unmethylated in the corresponding mouse tissues. Based on this analysis, we extrapolate that
about 70% of orthologous loci between human and mouse may have conserved (differing by
less than 20%) DNA methylation profiles. This finding adds further evidence to the concept
that many epigenetic states may be evolutionarily conserved between mammals. A recent
study already showed that epigenetic histone modifications are strongly conserved between
human and mouse even though many of the corresponding sites were not conserved at the
DNA level37.
Discussion
The generation of a DNA methylation reference map of the human genome represents an
important contribution towards the elucidation of the human epigenetic code. The present
study reveals new insights on how DNA methylation contributes to the epigenetic plasticity
of the human genome and demonstrates that large-scale and quantifiable DNA methylation
analysis at the ultimately desirable single base pair resolution is possible using the
sequencing infrastructure established for the human genome project. Similar to the
ENCODE38 and HAPMAP39 resources, the availability of a high-resolution DNA
methylation resource adds another information layer to the annotation and understanding of
chromatin which defines the functional state of the human genome. The HEP and other
epigenome projects can further be expected to be invaluable for the discovery of novel
epigenetic diagnostics and drugs40, the monitoring of drug efficacy41 and the development
of a truly integrated (epi)genetic approach42 to common disease.
Material & Methods
Cell and Tissue samples
Tissue samples were obtained from one of the following sources: Asterand, (Detroit, US),
Pathlore Plc. (Nottingham, UK), Tissue Transformation Technologies (T-cubed, Edison,
US), Northwest Andrology (Missoula, US), NDRI (Philadelphia, US) and Biocat GmBH
(Heidelberg, Germany). Only anonymized samples were used and ethical approval was
obtained for the study. Contamination by blood cells is estimated to be low as blood specific
methylation profiles were not detected in the tissues. Human primary cells were obtained
from Cascade Biologics (Mansfield, United Kingdom), Cell Applications Inc. (San Diego,
United States), Analytical Biological Services Inc. (Wilmington, US), Cambrex Bio Science

(Verviers, Belgium) and from the DIGZ (Berlin, Germany). Dermal fibroblasts,
keratinocytes and melanocytes were cultured according to the supplier’s recommendations
up to a maximum of 3 passages reducing the risk of aberrant methylation due to extended
culturing. As an additional control we compared the average methylation of selected
amplicons obtained from dermal fibroblasts, keratinocytes and melanocytes with the
methylation of the same loci in additional human skin samples. No significant deviation
between the methylation of the primary cells and tissues were detected, indicating that cell
culturing for a limited number of passages does not change DNA methylation. CD4+ T-
lymphocytes were isolated from fresh whole blood by depletion of CD4+ monocytes
followed by a negative selection. CD8+ cells were isolated from fresh whole blood by
positive selection. Subsequent FACS analysis confirmed a purity of CD4+/CD8+ T-
lymphocytes greater than 90%. In some cases, DNA samples were pooled according to the
sex and age of the donors. All genders were confirmed by sex-specific PCR.
Amplicon selection and classification
Amplicons were selected and classified based on Ensembl22,43 (build NCBI 34) annotation.
5′-UTR: Overlapping by at least 200 bp with or within core region of 2,000 bp upstream to
500 bp downstream of the TSS. Where multiple sites were annotated per gene, the first
annotated TSS was used. Exonic: Greater than 50% and at least 200 bp of amplicon
overlapping with annotated exon. Intronic: Greater than 50% and at least 200 bp of amplicon
overlapping with annotated intron. ECR: ≥70% DNA sequence similarity (including ≥4
CpGs) for at least 100 bp between human and mouse non-coding sequences. Out of 3,249
ECRs identified on chromosome 20, 290 intergenic and 206 intronic (496 in total) ECRs
were selected. Sp1: Overlapping with putative Sp1 sites identified by ChIP-chip analysis24.
Other: amplicons that are not located within a gene or a 5′-UTR and additionally do not
belong to any other category. CGI were classified based on the criteria by Gardiner-Garden
and Frommer44 with the modification that CGIs had to have a minimum length of 400 bp as
opposed to 200 bp as longer CGIs are less frequently associated with Alu repeats45.
DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing
DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNA Genomic-tip kit according the manufacturer’s
recommendation. After quantification, DNA was bisulfite converted as previously
described46. Bisulfite-specific primers with a minimum length of 18bp were designed using
a modified primer-3 program. The target sequence of the designed primers contained no
CpGs allowing amplification of both un- and hypermethylated DNAs. All primers were
tested for their ability to yield high quality sequences. Primers that gave rise to an amplicon
of the expected size using non-bisulfite treated DNA as a template were discarded, thus
ensuring the specificity for bisulphite-converted DNAs. Primers were also tested for
specificity on bisulfite DNA by electronic PCR. DNA amplification was set up in 96-well
plates using an automated pipeline as described previously6. PCR amplicons were quality
controlled by agarose gel electrophoresis, re-arrayed into 384-well plates for high-
throughput processing, cleaned up using ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio) to
remove any excess nucleotides and primers and sequenced directly in the forward and
reverse directions. Some PCR amplicons were subcloned into pGEM vector (Promega,
Madison, USA) and up to 20 clones were picked for sequencing. Sequencing was performed
on ABI 3730 capillary sequencers using 1/32nd dilution of ABI Prism BigDye terminator
V3.1 sequencing chemistry after hotstart (96°C for 30 seconds) thermocycling (92°C for 5
seconds, 50°C for 5 seconds, 60°C for 120 seconds × 44 cycles) and ethanol precipitation.
PCR fragments were sequenced using the same PCR amplification primers. Trace files and
methylation signals at a given CpG site were quantified (estimated sensitivity >20%
difference in methylation) using the ESME software as previously described47. The software
used for the analysis of all loci described in this manuscript is freely available at

www.epigenome.org. The bisulfite sequencing-based approach chosen here allows to
measure DNA methylation with high reproducibility and accuracy, as independent
measurements are derived from both the sense and antisense strands of a PCR amplicon (R =
0.87; N = 557,837). In addition, about 4.1% of the amplicons were subjected to independent
PCR amplification and sequencing. These technical replicates also displayed high
correlation (R = 0.9; N = 15,655). Furthermore, the signal is independent of the position of
the measured CpG within the amplicon, which is supported by high correlation between
measurements of the same CpGs in overlapping amplicons (R = 0.85; N = 91,528).
RNA extraction and RT-PCR
Aliquots of the same samples of the human melanocytes, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, CD4+
and CD8+ cells that were used for methylation analysis were used for RNA analysis.
Primary cell cultures (maximum of 3 passages) of human melanocytes, keratinocytes and
dermal fibroblasts cells were harvested and kept at −80 °C until RNA isolation. Isolated
RNA samples from heart, liver and skeletal muscle were purchased from Ambion (Austin,
US) and kept at −80°C until used for reverse transcription. Total RNA was isolated using the
RNeasy kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) followed by cDNA synthesis using the
Omniscript RT kit from the same supplier and random hexamers. PCR (92°C for 1 minute,
55-63°C (depending on assay) for 1 minute, 72°C for 1 minute for 30 to 40 cycles
(depending on assay)) was performed using the HotStartTaq DNA polymerase kit (Qiagen)
with 3 μl of the prepared cDNA and gene-specific primers. All kits were used according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations. PCR products were analysed by electrophoresis on
2.5 % agarose gels. Universal RNA was obtained from Biocat (Heidelberg, Germany) and
total RNA isolated from brain and sperm from Stratagene (La Jolla, California, US).
Analysis and Statistical methods
Methylation profiles were calculated as described previously6 and are available from the
HEP database/browser at www.epigenome.org. Kruskall-Wallis tests were used to determine
differential methylation between tissues (T-DMRs), measuring the proportion of uncorrected
p-values that were smaller 0.001 for all CpGs. As this test is insensitive to samples that were
only measured in a single sample such as sperm and placenta, the obtained number of T-
DMRs is unlikely to be overstated due to putative aberrant methylation within these
samples. Some T-DMRs were experimentally validated by sequencing independent DNA
samples. Equality between two groups (age and sex) was performed using Wilcoxon tests.
For the analysis of co-methylation, median methylation values were used over all technical
replicates to minimize any skewing effect because of possible outliers. In addition, we
excluded all CpGs where the methylation values derived from the forward and reverse reads
of the same amplicon differed by more than 10%. Based on this criterion, 38% of CpGs
were excluded from the analysis. As only one DNA strand was analysed following bisulfite
conversion, no assessment of hemimethylation was possible in this case. Methylation
changes were calculated based on the absolute methylation differences between CpG pairs
of identical samples. To minimize a bias introduced by the amplicon selection, the analysis
was performed using both, individual CpGs (window size 20,000bp) and CpGs of the same
amplicons. Co-methylation of CpGs was described as a function of similar methylation
levels over distance (in bp).
For scatter plots, equal amounts of measurements were binned and ranked by numerical
order of the X-axis values, representing means of X- and Y- data. For box plots and
histograms, data were binned according to the intervals indicated on the X-axis containing
different numbers of measurements.

Figure 1. Type and distribution of amplicons
In total, 2,524 amplicons were analyzed from 6 distinct categories: 43.7% for 5′-
untranslated regions (5′-UTR), 22.5% for evolutionary conserved regions (ECR), 14.3% for
intronic regions (Intronic), 13.3% for exonic regions (Exonic), 3.6% for Sp1 transcription
factor binding sites (Sp1) and 2.6% for Other. Details of the selection criteria for each
category are described in Materials and Methods.

Examples of methylation profiles are shown for 8 amplicons and include examples of T-
DMRs for genes of diverse functions (OSM, NP_0010001479.1, SMTN and RNF185) and
examples of a hyper- (3rd profile from left) and an unmethylated (5th profile from left) CpG
island. Rows represent different samples and are grouped according to tissue/cell type.
Columns depict CpG sites and the corresponding methylation values are indicated by
colour-code for each cell (blank cells indicate no data).

CpG methylation values were binned (each bin containing 1,000 values), averaged and

Figure 5. Global DNA methylation and age/sex
Differences of mean methylation were determined in three tissues (heart muscle, skeletal
muscle, liver) for two age groups (group 1: 26 years, SD +/− 4 years and group 2: 68 years,
SD +/− 8 years, red line), males/females (orange line) and two different primary cells (CD4+
lymphocytes, dermal fibroblasts, blue line). As control, tissues were re-sampled (10,000-
fold) for both age groups and their mean methylation differences were calculated (grey
area). The same control was carried out for sex-specific differences and similar results were
obtained (data not shown). As positive control for sex-specific methylation, an X-
chromosomal gene (ELK1) was used that displays the expected methylation difference of
about 50% (green line). While the 7.1% difference between primary cells (blue line) is
highly significant, the respective differences of 0.275% and 0.1% between age groups (red
line) and sex (orange line) fall within the differential range observed for the control (grey
area) and are therefore not significant.

Figure 6.
(a) Relative proportion of putative T-DMRs. Normalized for the number of amplicons in
each category, the proportion of T-DMRs was highest in ECRs, both intergenic and
intragenic ECRs while T-DMRs located within 5′-UTRs have a lower frequency of
occurrence (b) Correlation between 5′-UTR methylation and mRNA expression.
Representative results are shown for 2 genes. Expression was determined for 43 genes and
one positive control (ACTINB1) in 8 tissues/cell types using reverse transcriptase (RT)
PCR. Total RNAs derived from mixed tissues and cell lines were used as positive control.
Differential 5′-UTR methylation is inversely correlated with mRNA expression for OSM
and SERPINB5 (for which the inverse correlation was previously known) but not for
TBX18. The colour code depicts the degree of 5′-UTR methylation for each gene (yellow ≈
0% methylation, green ≈ 50% and blue ≈ 100% methylation).

59 orthologous amplicons (37 ECRs (yellow) and 22 5′-UTRs (grey)) were analyzed in four
tissues (skin, skeletal muscle, heart muscle and liver) from both species. The majority
(69.4%) of ECR and 5′-UTR amplicons differed by less than 20% methylation, indicating
significant conservation. Both, hyper- and unmethylated amplicons showed a similar degree
of methylation conservation (data not shown).
