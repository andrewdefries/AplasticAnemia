ABSTRACT
The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was
recently awarded to Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol
Greider and Jack Szostak for their pioneering
studies on chromosome termini (telomeres) and
their discovery of telomerase, the enzyme that syn-
thesizes telomeres. Telomerase is a unique cellular
reverse transcriptase that contains an integral RNA
subunit, the telomerase RNA and a catalytic protein
subunit, the telomerase reverse transcriptase
(TERT), as well as several species-specific acces-
sory proteins. Telomerase is essential for genome
stability and is associated with a broad spectrum
of human diseases including various forms of
cancer, bone marrow failure and pulmonary
fibrosis. A better understanding of telomerase
structure and function will shed important insights
into how this enzyme contributes to human disease.
To this end, a series of high-resolution structural
studies have provided critical information on TERT
architecture and may ultimately elucidate novel
targets for therapeutic intervention. In this review,
we discuss the current knowledge of TERT structure
and function, revealed through the detailed analysis
of TERT from model organisms. To emphasize the
physiological importance of telomeres and telomer-
ase, we also present a general discussion of the
human diseases associated with telomerase
dysfunction.
INTRODUCTION
Telomeres are essential nucleoprotein structures that
deﬁne the terminal segments of linear chromosomes. In
eukaryotes, telomeres are essential for genome stability,
functioning to prevent chromosome ends from being
recognized and processed as bona ﬁde DNA double-strand
(ds) breaks. Importantly, telomeres also provide a solution
to the ‘end-replication problem’, which was ﬁrst proposed
by Olovnikov and Watson in the early 1970s (1–3). This
model predicts that during the process of DNA replica-
tion, a small amount of DNA from the 30
-ends of linear
chromosomes is left unreplicated. As a result, chromo-
some 30
-ends progressively shorten during consecutive
cell divisions, which limits cellular lifespan (1–3).
Chromosome ends that lack suﬃcient telomeric repeats
are prone to recombination and fusion with other pieces
of genomic DNA, events that can interfere with normal
cell cycle progression and promote genetic instability.
Thus, telomeres provide a protective cap for the ends of
linear chromosomes.
One universal feature of telomeric DNA is the organ-
ization into a C/A-rich strand and a complementary
G/T-rich strand. Telomeric DNA almost always
contains tandem repeats of simple, species-speciﬁc
sequences that are 6–8 nucleotides (nt) long [e.g. (TTAG
GG)n in mammals]. Another conserved feature of telomer-
ic DNA is the organization into a ds segment with a
single-stranded (ss) 30
-overhang. Electron microscopic
analysis of psoralen cross-linked human and mouse telo-
meric DNA revealed large lariat-like structures containing
thousands of TTAGGG repeats (4). These structures are
known as telomere-loops (t-loops) and are postulated to
be formed and stabilized by invasion of the telomeric
30
-overhang into the duplex repeat array (4). Telomere
loops have also been detected in trypanosomes (5),
ciliates (6), plants (7), nematodes (8) and some strains of
yeast (9,10). The existence of t-loops provides an attractive
model that could explain how ss chromosome ends are
protected from degradation, recombination and fusion
(11). However, the molecular mechanism(s) that regulate
t-loop formation in vivo remain to be elucidated. If living
cells do contain t-loops, one interesting possibility is that
telomeres may adopt alternative conformations at speciﬁc
stages of the cell cycle (12). The identiﬁcation of novel,
cell-cycle-speciﬁc telomere-associated proteins will provide
important insights into telomere dynamics and length
regulation in vivo.

Various proteins have been shown to associate with
telomeric DNA and are implicated in the formation and
maintenance of telomere architecture. These proteins are
the focus of excellent reviews by Linger and Price (13) and
Palm and de Lange (11), and will not be discussed in detail
in this article. One general concept, however, relates to the
evolution of telomere-associated proteins. Although
telomere function is conserved in diverse organisms,
the architecture and composition of telomere-associated
proteins is remarkably varied and seems to have
changed rapidly during evolution (13). For example,
human telomeres are bound by a six-protein complex
called shelterin, comprised of TRF1, TRF2, POT1,
RAP1, TIN2 and TPP1, which interacts with ss and ds
telomeric DNA (11). In contrast, budding yeast telomeres
are bound by two separate protein complexes (13). One
contains the Cdc13, Stn1 and Ten1 proteins and binds the
G-rich 30
-overhang (14). The other, which binds duplex
telomeric DNA, is minimally composed of Rap1, Rif1
and Rif2 (15). Despite these diﬀerences in composition,
however, the telomere-associated proteins have a
conserved function, which is to assemble a protective
cap that ensures telomeres are maintained at an appropri-
ate length and are protected from being recognized and
processed as broken DNA. The ability to perform this
task is facilitated by additional species-speciﬁc protein–
protein interactions (11,13).
De novo synthesis of telomeric DNA in most eukaryotes
is performed by the cellular ribonucleoprotein reverse
transcriptase (RT) telomerase. Originally discovered by
Carol Greider and Elizabeth Blackburn in the ciliate
Tetrahymena thermophila (16–18), telomerase is a unique
RT that contains a catalytic protein subunit, the telomer-
ase RT (TERT), the telomerase RNA (TR) and species-
speciﬁc accessory proteins. Telomere synthesis involves
TERT-catalyzed reverse transcription of a small
template region within TR and telomerase activity can
be reconstituted in rabbit reticulocyte lysates by
co-expressing the TERT and TR subunits (19–21).
Importantly, species-speciﬁc accessory proteins regulate
telomerase biogenesis, subcellular localization and
function in vivo. For example, mass spectrometric
analysis of aﬃnity-puriﬁed telomerase from HeLa cells
has identiﬁed integral protein components of human tel-
omerase: dyskerin, NHP2, NOP10, pontin/reptin and
TCAB1 (22–25). Dyskerin, NHP2 and NOP10 are
required for the stability and accumulation of human tel-
omerase RNA (hTR) in vivo (22). Similarly, pontin and
reptin are two closely related ATPases necessary for the
stability of dyskerin and hTR in vivo (24). The current
model is that dyskerin, pontin and reptin form a scaﬀold
that recruits and stabilizes hTR, and assembles the tel-
omerase ribonucleoprotein particle. Once this complex is
formed, pontin and reptin are thought to dissociate from
the complex and yield the catalytically active enzyme (24).
The subcellular localization of telomerase appears to be
regulated by the recently identiﬁed protein TCAB1 (25).
Further studies are needed to elucidate the biochemical
and molecular signiﬁcance of the intricate network of
protein–protein and protein–nucleic acid interactions
within the telomerase holoenzyme. Moreover, it will be
important to investigate whether the composition of the
holoenzyme changes in speciﬁc stages of the cell cycle.
This information will provide important insight into
how human telomerase functions in vivo. Notably, the
composition of the telomerase holoenzyme varies signiﬁ-
cantly between species and the reader is referred to Collins
(26) and Gallardo and Chartrand (27) for excellent
reviews of this topic.
THE TELOMERASE RT SUBUNIT
The catalytic core of telomerase is composed of the RNA
subunit (TR) and the catalytic protein subunit (TERT),
whereas the holoenzyme contains additional
species-speciﬁc accessory proteins. The ﬁrst TERT
subunits were identiﬁed through genetic screens in yeast
(28) and the biochemical puriﬁcation of Euplotes
aediculatus telomerase (29,30). The E. aediculatus protein
was identiﬁed as a homolog of the yeast protein and
sequence comparison with prototypical RTs revealed an
evolutionarily conserved RT domain in both proteins (30).
The ﬁrst direct evidence that TERT was the catalytic
subunit of telomerase came from in vivo studies showing
that substitution of evolutionarily conserved residues
within the RT catalytic triad of the yeast protein caused
telomere shortening and cellular senescence in vivo and
eliminated enzymatic activity in vitro (30). TERT
homologs were subsequently identiﬁed in humans,
rodents and ciliates (21,31–35). Further evidence that
TERT was the catalytic subunit of human and
T. thermophila telomerase came from studies showing
that telomerase activity could be reconstituted in vitro by
co-expressing wild-type TERT and TR in rabbit reticulo-
cyte lysates (19–21). These studies were also the ﬁrst to
demonstrate that TERT and TR were suﬃcient to recon-
stitute telomerase activity in vitro (19–21), although it is
important to note that rabbit reticulocyte lysates contain
endogenous proteins that interact with telomerase to fa-
cilitate its assembly and activity [e.g. heat shock (36) and
chaperone (37) proteins].
Bioinformatics and mutational studies have collectively
established that TERT contains three main structural
elements: (i) a long N-terminal extension that contains
conserved DNA- and RNA-binding domains; (ii) a
central catalytic RT domain; and (iii) a short C-terminal
extension (38). To exemplify this domain organization, the
predicted linear architecture of human TERT (hTERT) is
illustrated in Figure 1A. Although this organization
deﬁnes almost all TERT proteins, there are a few
notable exceptions. First, certain insect and nematode
TERTs harbor a truncated N-terminus that does not
contain the telomerase essential N-terminal (TEN)
domain (39,40). Second, the C-terminal region is absent
from Giardia lamblia and nematode TERTs (40). Third,
Plasmodium falciparum TERT contains an abundance of
hypervariable insertions between the conserved domains
and is at least three times larger than all other TERT
proteins (41). The biological signiﬁcance of this divergent
architecture is not clear and it will be interesting to
5610 Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, No. 17
determine if other TERT domains and/or cellular proteins
compensate for the missing domains in vivo.
A potential advance in our understanding of telomerase
architecture came from the recent atomic-resolution struc-
ture of a protein thought to represent full-length Tribolium
castaneum (ﬂour beetle) TERT, in complex with an 18-nt
telomeric oligonucleotide (42). However, whether this
protein truly represents a telomerase is currently contro-
versial. Formal proof that this T. castaneum protein rep-
resents the catalytic TERT subunit remains to be
demonstrated, which is an important question to address
given the complex evolution of telomerase and telomere-
maintenance in insects (39,43). For example, Dipteran
insects (e.g. mosquitoes) lack telomerase activity and
maintain their telomeres via recombination-based mech-
anisms, whereas Arthropods (e.g. silkworm) have
pentanucleotide (TTAGG)n telomeric repeats and
contain detectable levels of telomerase activity (39,43).
Interestingly, the predicted T. castaneum TERT lacks a
signiﬁcant portion of the N-terminus that is critical for
telomerase activity in ciliates, yeast and humans (42).
One possibility is that T. castaneum TERT may be
inactive, which would be supported by the absence of ca-
nonical telomeric repeats in this insect. Another predic-
tion, which cannot be excluded in the absence of
biochemical support for telomerase activity, is that the
putative TERT represents a non-telomerase RT. Despite
these potential caveats, the crystal structure reported by
Skordalakes and colleagues (42) represents an important
snapshot of a TERT-like protein and provides the basis
for structural comparisons with other TERTs.
The T. castaneum TERT structure suggests a
ring-shaped protein held together by extensive hydropho-
bic interactions between the N- and C-terminal regions
(Figure 1B) (42). This architecture is congruent with
previous biochemical studies of human and Euplotes
crassus TERT, which revealed physical interactions
between N- and C-terminal domains (44–46). The ring-
like structure of TERT is akin to that of other nucleic
acid polymerases, including that of human immunodeﬁ-
ciency virus (HIV), and contains the hallmark ‘thumb’,
‘palm’ and ‘ﬁngers’ motifs (Figure 1A and B) (42).
Notably, the interior dimensions of the TERT ring struc-
ture predict that it can accommodate seven or eight base
pairs of ds nucleic acid (42). This is consistent with
previous biochemical studies demonstrating that the
RNA–DNA duplex in the telomerase active site is main-
tained at a length of seven to eight base pairs (47,48). The
ring’s interior is lined with amino acids that mediate
protein–nucleic acid interactions, nucleotide binding and
DNA synthesis in yeast and hTERT (49–54). An import-
ant future challenge will be to determine the high-
resolution structure of TERT in complex with its
integral RNA subunit and/or additional protein compo-
nents. Towards this goal, recent studies allowed the deter-
mination of the crystal structure of the T. castaneum
TERT in complex with a short RNA–DNA hybrid
designed to resemble the putative RNA-templating

region and complementary DNA sequence (55). One po-
tential caveat to this study, however, is that the RNA
component of this telomerase is not known and therefore,
the physical contacts observed in this structure may be
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than those that occur in the
presence of the biological RNA subunit and telomeric
chromatin. An equally important challenge will be to
solve the crystal structure of full length TERT from an
organism with well-characterized telomerase activity.
The TERT N-terminal extension
The N-terminal extension of most TERTs contains two
conserved domains, the TEN domain and telomerase
RNA-binding domain (TRBD) (Figure 1A). High-
resolution structures of the T. thermophila TEN domain
and TRBD indicate that both of these regions represent
novel protein folds involved in binding ss nucleic acids
(56,57). In between these domains is a relatively long
and unstructured linker region that may be important
for conformational ﬂexibility within the holoenzyme
(Figure 1A). The N-terminal extension also contains
several conserved telomerase-speciﬁc motifs, including
the CP, QFP and TS motifs (Figure 1A) (58,59). These
regions are important for TERT-TR binding interactions
and the rate of template copying during telomere synthe-
sis (19,58,60–69), and may thus be amenable to thera-
peutic interventions that inhibit or augment telomerase
activity.
The crystal structure of the T. thermophila TRBD
reveals that it is organized into two asymmetric lobes
that contain residues from the CP and TS motifs
(Figure 2A) (56). The two halves are connected by
extended loops that impart the domain with structural
ﬂexibility (56). Hydrophilic and hydrophobic CP and TS
residues form an extended RNA-binding groove on the
surface of the domain. The dimensions of this cavity
reveal a relatively wide hydrophilic pocket that could ac-
commodate dsRNA and a narrow hydrophobic pocket
that could accommodate ssRNA (56). In the context of
full-length T. castaneum TERT, the RNA-binding groove
is located on the side of the ring and faces the interior of
the ring in close proximity to the active site (Figure 2B)
(42). This is believed to permit the RNA 50
-end to enter
the ring’s interior where the active site is located. The
structural data is supported by biochemical studies with
ciliate, yeast and human telomerase that have identiﬁed
the CP and TS motifs as being critical for TR-binding
and telomerase activity in vitro and in vivo (19,58,60–68).
The most N-terminal domain in TERT (the TEN
domain) exhibits binding aﬃnity for ss telomeric DNA
and contains residues that are essential for telomerase
activity (38,57,70–75). Furthermore, a speciﬁc leucine in
the TEN domain of ciliate TERT (L14) has been identiﬁed
as a critical determinant of the enzyme’s ability to add
multiple telomeric repeats to a single telomeric primer
(74). These observations indicate that the TEN domain
has an important role in DNA substrate recognition and
elongation. Interestingly, the TEN domain also displays a
weak non-speciﬁc RNA-binding activity (57). Although
the signiﬁcance of this interaction is presently unclear,
it is possible that in the context of the full-length
protein, the TEN domain and TRBD co-operate to
ensure sequence-speciﬁc TERT–TR binding interactions
and optimal template positioning during telomerase
assembly and/or telomere synthesis.
The TERT RT domain
The catalytic domain of TERT is the most characterized
region of the protein and contains seven evolutionarily
conserved RT motifs (see Figures 1A and 2C) essential
for enzymatic activity (19,20,30,31,33,51,76–78). The
TERT RT domain is organized into two subdomains
that resemble the ‘ﬁngers’ and ‘palm’ subdomains of
prototypical RT enzymes (Figure 2C) (30,31,79). These
regions are connected by a loop that contains the
conserved ‘primer grip’ region of motif E (42).
Molecular models predict that the loop makes direct
contacts with the RNA–DNA hybrid and the 30
-end of
the ssDNA, suggesting that the primer grip region could
be involved in positioning the 30
-end within the enzyme
active site (Figure 2B) (42). This model is supported by
biochemical studies of yeast and hTERT that have
identiﬁed an important role for this region in ssDNA-
binding and processive telomere synthesis in vitro and
in vivo (80,81). Further evidence for contacts between
the TERT primer grip and DNA primer have been
provided by structural studies of T. castaneum TERT in
complex with an RNA–DNA hairpin designed to
resemble the putative telomerase RNA template and telo-
meric DNA (55).
One unique structural feature of the telomerase RT
domain is a large insertion between motifs A and B0
,
called the ‘insertion in ﬁngers’ domain (IFD)
(Figure 1A) (30,31). The IFD is comprised of two antipar-
allel a-helices that are sandwiched between the ﬁngers and
palm subdomains (Figure 2C) (42). The crystal structure
reveals that the IFD is engaged in intramolecular
protein-protein interactions that organize and stabilize
this region of the RT domain (42). Importantly, the IFD
makes extensive contacts with an a-helix that is implicated
in making direct contacts with the backbone of the
incoming DNA primer (42). Mutations that alter the
structural integrity of the IFD are expected to indirectly
compromise protein–DNA and RNA–DNA interactions,
thus impairing enzyme activity. Consistent with this,
alanine substitutions of moderately conserved residues in
the IFD of Est2p (yeast TERT) were found to impair tel-
omerase activity and processivity in vitro and prevented
telomere maintenance in vivo (52).
The TERT active site contains three invariant aspartic
acids, one of which resides in motif A and the other two
within motif C (Figure 2D) (30,31). These residues are
conserved in RTs and form a catalytic triad that partici-
pates directly in nucleotide addition via a two-metal ion
mechanism (30,31). Alanine substitution of these amino
acids abrogates telomerase activity (19,33,64,76,77).
Conserved residues from motifs 1, 2, A, B0
, C and D
form the nucleotide-binding pocket, located at the
interface between the palm and ﬁngers subdomains
(Figure 2D) (42). Two conserved surface-exposed
5612 Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, No. 17
residues from motifs A and C (tyrosine and valine, re-
spectively) form a hydrophobic patch that is predicted to
bind the base of the nucleotide substrate. This interaction
would facilitate nucleotide positioning in the active site for
co-ordination with a metal ion and the 30
-end of the DNA
primer (42). This model is supported by biochemical
studies of ciliate, yeast and hTERT that have implicated
these residues in nucleotide insertion rate, polymerase
ﬁdelity and enzyme processivity (78,80,82).
Sequence alignment of the TERT RT domain revealed a
novel telomerase-speciﬁc motif (motif 3) between motifs 2
and A (Figure 1A) (83,84). Interestingly, although the pre-
dicted secondary-structure of motif 3 is evolutionarily
conserved, the primary sequence is only conserved in ver-
tebrate and ciliate telomerases. This suggests that motif 3
may regulate species-speciﬁc aspects of telomerase bio-
chemistry, such as repeat addition processivity (84).
Alanine substitution screening of this motif in hTERT
identiﬁed mutations that either abrogated telomerase
activity or caused a signiﬁcant increase in the rate or
processivity of telomere synthesis in vitro (84). These bio-
chemical characterizations have provided new insight into
the telomerase reaction mechanism by identifying speciﬁc
amino acids in hTERT that independently regulate two
critical aspects of telomere synthesis. An important area
of future research will be to elucidate how mutations in
motif 3 aﬀect the biogenesis, activity and regulation of
telomerase.
The TERT C-terminal extension
In contrast to the N-terminus and RT domain, the
C-terminus of TERT shows only weak sequence conser-
vation suggesting that it may have species-speciﬁc func-
tions or that diﬀerent amino acid sequences have evolved
to fold into similar structural domains. The C-terminal
extension of TERT adopts a novel protein fold,
although structural comparison of TERT with the
closely related HIV RT indicates that this region repre-
sents the thumb domain of telomerase (42). The
C-terminus is a helical bundle that contains several
surface-exposed loops that are thought to contribute to
the formation and stabilization of an RNA–DNA
heteroduplex in the enzyme active site (Figure 2B)
(42,55). Mutations in this region aﬀect the nucleotide

and repeat addition processivity of human and yeast tel-
omerase, telomere length maintenance in human cells and
the subcellular localization of hTERT (49,53,54,80,85).
Furthermore, it was shown that the addition of an
epitope tag to the C-terminus of hTERT abolishes
telomere elongation in vivo, suggesting that the conform-
ation of this region is important for hTERT function (86).
Interestingly, the C-terminal extension is essential for tel-
omerase activity in T. thermophila and humans, but is dis-
pensable for telomerase activity in yeast (58,62,63,65) and
is completely absent in other organisms (40). These obser-
vations further suggest that the C-terminal extension has
species-speciﬁc roles in vivo. Additional structure–function
studies are needed to understand how this region contrib-
utes to the biochemical and molecular properties of tel-
omerase from diﬀerent organisms. In this regard, the
in vitro and in vivo characterization of disease-associated
hTERT mutants will likely provide invaluable insight
these aspects of human telomerase (87,88).
THE TELOMERASE RNA SUBUNIT
A unique feature of telomerase is that the RNA template
for DNA synthesis is an integral component of the holo-
enzyme. Although a detailed discussion of the RNA
subunit is beyond the scope of this review, it is necessary
to comment on some of the key properties of the verte-
brate TR. The reader is referred to Theimer and Feigon
(89) for a comprehensive review of the structure and
function of TR subunits from various organisms.
Phylogenetic comparative analysis of vertebrate TR
predicts three conserved domains: (i) the pseudoknot/
template core domain; (ii) the CR4/CR5 domain (for
conserved regions 4 and 5, respectively); and (iii) a box
H/ACA domain (90). The core domain is essential for
telomerase activity in vitro and in vivo (89). This region
contains the template for telomere addition, the 50
- and
30
-boundary elements that prevent the incorporation of
non-template nucleotides, a putative TERT binding site
and a conserved pseudoknot structure (90,91). Human tel-
omerase activity can be reconstituted in vitro by
co-expressing the pseudoknot/template domain and the
CR4/CR5 domain in the presence of hTERT (92,93).
The TR domains work together to mediate TR-TERT
interactions, nucleotide and repeat addition processivity,
and enzyme ﬁdelity (89). The 30
-end of vertebrate TR
contains two conserved motifs, the box H and ACA
elements (box H/ACA domain), which serve as binding
sites for proteins involved in RNA processing, stability
and subcellular localization (89). The box H/ACA
domain is essential for TR stability, processing, nuclear
localization and telomerase activity in vivo (89,94,95).
Mutations in the gene encoding TR have been linked to
the multi-system disorder called dyskeratosis congenita,
highlighting the clinical importance of this molecule.
Furthermore, the TR gene is ampliﬁed in several human
cancers (96–98), thus making it a potential target for
therapeutic inhibitors of telomerase activity in cancer
cells (99).
THE TELOMERASE REACTION CYCLE
Telomerase has the unique ability to catalyze multiple
rounds of template copying and add hundreds of nucleo-
tides to the same DNA primer. This contrasts with proto-
typical RTs, which copy a relatively large RNA genome
into a single molecule of complementary DNA. As
illustrated in Figure 3 and discussed in the following
sections, the telomerase reaction cycle can be divided
into three basic steps: (i) primer recognition and binding;
(ii) synthesis of the ﬁrst telomeric repeat; and (iii) trans-
location and realignment of the new DNA 30
-end to
initiate the next round of telomere synthesis.
During telomere elongation, the RNA template is
reverse transcribed using canonical Watson–Crick
base-pairing to specify the telomeric sequence. Telomere
synthesis proceeds by the sequential addition of
deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) to the free
30
-hydroxyl group of the telomeric ssDNA primer. The
telomeric ssDNA overhang is believed to be the natural
primer for telomerase-mediated DNA synthesis in vivo.
However, telomerase can elongate almost any G-rich
linear ssDNA primer that contains a free 30
-end in vitro
(16, 100). Parallel intermolecular G-quadruplex substrates
are also eﬃcient substrates for ciliate telomerase in vitro
(101–103).
Telomerase incorporates consecutive dNTPs without
dissociating from the primer by a reaction known as nu-
cleotide addition processivity (38). During telomere elong-
ation, the RNA–DNA hybrid is kept at a constant length
of seven to eight base pairs by melting bonds at the distal
end of the template as new bonds are formed at the
proximal end (48). When the 50
-template boundary
element is reached, a translocation step repositions the
new DNA 30
-end within the template for a second round
of telomere synthesis. The ability of telomerase to catalyze
more than one round of DNA synthesis while bound to
the same telomeric primer is referred to as repeat addition
processivity. As discussed below, interactions between the
50
-end of the primer and regions of TERT outside the RT
domain are required for repeat addition processivity and
have been termed ‘anchor sites’ to emphasize their pre-
dicted role in anchoring TERT to the DNA primer
during telomere synthesis (38).
Repeat addition processivity
Repeat addition processivity was ﬁrst observed with
T. thermophila telomerase and subsequently with human
telomerase (104,105). Many rodent and fungal telomer-
ases, however, are relatively non-processive and catalyze
short elongation products in vitro and in vivo (106–108).
Furthermore, genetic studies with mutant T. thermophila
telomerase RNAs indicate that telomerase has limited
processivity in vivo (109,110). These studies raise questions
regarding the signiﬁcance of repeat addition processivity
in vivo. Nonetheless, biochemical and genetic studies
indicate that processive repeat addition is a biologically
relevant property of telomerase. First, telomerase-speciﬁc
residues that mediate processivity have been located in the
RT domain (52,78,84), the N-terminal extension
(71,74,111–113) and the C-terminal extension (53).
5614 Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, No. 17
Mutations in these regions in human, ciliate or yeast TERT
selectively alters repeat addition processivity in vitro and
causes defects in telomere length maintenance in vivo
(52,69,74,84,111–113). Second, these regions are important
for telomerase-dependent extension of partially or com-
pletely nontelomeric primers, which provides indirect
evidence for a role in primer binding (74,111–113). Third,
mutations that speciﬁcally increase repeat addition
processivity in vitro and cause telomere over-elongation
in vivo have been identiﬁed in ciliate and yeast TERT
(71,78). Finally, in vivo analyses of budding yeast telomer-
ase show that repeat addition processivity is signiﬁcantly
increased at extremely short telomeres, suggesting that this
unique feature of telomerase may enable cells to rapidly
elongate critically short telomeres (114,115). This model
predicts that the extent of processive repeat addition
depends upon telomere length and thus, could partially
explain the variance observed between telomerase repeat
addition processivity in vitro and in vivo. Further studies
will be required to completely understand this unique
aspect of telomerase biochemistry.
Telomerase anchor sites
A long-standing notion in telomerase biochemistry is that
the enzyme contains DNA-binding regions outside the
RT domain that are required for processive telomere
elongation. The existence of one or more telomerase
‘anchor sites’ was precipitated by studies demonstrating
that ciliate and human telomerase could elongate non-
telomeric G-rich ssDNA primers in vitro (16,17,105,116).
Furthermore, telomerase was shown to add telomeric
repeats to chromosome breaks that contained non-
telomeric DNA during in vivo chromosome healing
(110,117). It was subsequently shown that primers con-
taining almost any sequence of ssDNA could be
extended in vitro if telomeric repeats were added to the
50
-end (100,118). These observations suggested that hy-
bridization between the DNA 30
-end and RNA template
was not required for primer elongation. This hypothesis
was further supported by biochemical studies of human
and yeast telomerase, which showed that the enzyme/
primer complex was mainly stabilized by contacts with
the catalytic protein subunit (119,120).
The ﬁrst direct evidence for a telomerase anchor region
was provided by photo-cross-linking studies performed
with E. aediculatus telomerase (121). Speciﬁcally, a
TERT-sized protein was cross-linked to the 50
-end of
photo-reactive ssDNA primers that were aligned in the
enzyme active site (121). The most eﬃcient protein–
DNA cross-links were established with bases 20–22 nt
upstream of the primer 30
-end and required the telomerase
RNA subunit. More recent studies have shown that
human and T. thermophila TERT can interact sequence-
speciﬁcally with telomeric ssDNA in the absence of TR
(75,81). These studies used biotinylated ssDNA primers to
Figure 3. Schematic diagram of the telomerase reaction cycle. This ﬁgure summarizes the fundamental steps of the telomerase reaction cycle: initial
primer recognition and binding, nucleotide addition and translocation. The telomerase RNA (TR) subunit is represented by a black line (not drawn
to scale). The TR supplies the template (grey rectangle) for telomere synthesis. DNA synthesis is catalyzed by the TERT. TERT contains a TEN
domain (pink sphere), a TRBD (purple oval), RT domain (blue sphere) and CTE (green oval). The TEN domain contains a unique ssDNA-binding
region, called the telomerase anchor site (transparent rectangle). The red line represents telomeric ssDNA. Telomerase binds the telomeric ssDNA
such that the 30
-end is aligned with the TR template in the active site (white star) and the 50
-end is positioned within the telomerase anchor site.
Telomerase reverse transcribes the template region, 1 nt at a time (nucleotide addition), until reaching the 50
-template boundary element (top right).
At this point, a translocation step repositions the new DNA 30
-end within the template for a second round of telomere synthesis (bottom).
Conformational changes within the telomerase holoenzyme are believed to facilitate nucleotide and repeat addition processivity.

investigate TERT–DNA interactions in vitro. One import-
ant ﬁnding was that a fragment of hTERT encompassing
amino acids 1–300 bound telomeric ssDNA as eﬃciently
as the full-length protein, providing the ﬁrst physical
evidence for an anchor site in the N-terminus of tel-
omerase (81). An equally important ﬁnding was that
the T. thermophila TERT (tTERT) C-terminus ex-
hibited telomeric ssDNA-binding activity in vitro (75).
Furthermore, it has been recently shown that a
puriﬁed human TEN domain spanning amino acids
1–200 directly interacts with telomeric DNA and this
interaction is dependent on the length and register of the
telomeric repeat (73). These studies indicate that TERT
contains multiple anchor sites, which are believed to
co-ordinate and regulate various stages of primer
binding and extension. Importantly, some studies
indicate that TERT-DNA interactions are enhanced by
the telomerase RNA subunit, suggesting that TR has an
important role in regulating anchor site interactions
(57,75,111,121).
Genetic and biochemical studies with ciliate, yeast and
mammalian telomerase suggest that the anchor site may
be comprised of a template-proximal and a template-distal
component (57,71,74,81,105,112,116,120,122–125). In this
model, both regions contribute to telomere binding and
elongation, but only relatively long primers (20 nt)
extend into the template-distal anchor region (47). The
existence of two separate anchor sites indicates a tripartite
mode of DNA-binding: (i) the primer 30
-end hybridizes
with the RNA template in the active site; (ii) the primer
nucleotides adjacent to the template-hybridizing region
interact with a template-proximal anchor site; and (iii)
the primer nucleotides at the 50
-end interact with the
template-distal anchor site (123).
The template-proximal telomerase anchor region has
been physically and functionally mapped to the
N-terminus of ciliate, yeast and hTERT
(38,71,72,74,75,81). The crystal structure of the tTERT
TEN domain revealed a previously-unrecognized
ssDNA-binding groove on the surface of this domain.
Photo-cross-linking studies showed that the tTERT TEN
domain possessed telomere-speciﬁc ssDNA-binding
activity in vitro (57,72). Mutagenesis of key residues
thought to be involved in ssDNA-binding, such as an in-
variant glutamine (tTERT Q168), signiﬁcantly reduced the
interaction between tTERT and telomeric ssDNA, and
impaired enzyme activity in vitro (57,72). Furthermore,
mutation of the corresponding residue in yeast Est2p
(Q146A) caused severe growth defects and telomere loss
in vivo (71). Most recently, hTERT Q169 was shown to be
important for the structure of the human telomerase
N-terminal extension, primer binding and nucleotide in-
corporation in vitro, as well as telomere length mainten-
ance in vivo (70,73). Interestingly, Q169 appears to be
particularly important for incorporating the second nu-
cleotide during telomere extension in vitro (70).
Collectively, the above studies indicate that this glutamine
residue forms part of an evolutionarily conserved anchor
site that facilitates primer recognition and orientation in
the active site for telomere synthesis.
Telomerase structural mobility
DNA polymerases undergo a series of conformational
changes during DNA synthesis (79,126). Structural
mobility confers polymerases with the ability to discrim-
inate against nucleotide misinsertion and incorporate
multiple nucleotides without dissociating from the DNA
primer. With respect to telomerase, it has been long
proposed that conformational changes mediate the tran-
sition between telomere synthesis initiation, elongation
and translocation (104).
Recent work with T. thermophila telomerase has
provided new insights into the structural mobility of the
telomerase anchor site (74). The crystal structure of the
tTERT TEN domain revealed that an evolutionarily-
conserved leucine (L14), in close proximity of Q168, was
involved in forming one edge of the ssDNA-binding
groove (57). The branched, hydrophobic side-chain of
leucine can theoretically engage in intra- or inter-
molecular protein–protein interactions. Structure–
function studies of tTERT identiﬁed an essential role for
L14 in the repeat addition processivity of ciliate telomer-
ase in vitro (74). Importantly, L14 mutants displayed
normal nucleotide addition processivity, thus identifying
a speciﬁc role for L14 in the telomerase translocation step
(74). An attractive model has been proposed in which L14
represents an intramolecular ‘door latch’, which holds the
TEN domain in close proximity of the catalytic site and
facilitates processive nucleotide addition (Figure 3) (74).
After synthesizing a complete telomeric repeat, a conform-
ational change occurs within telomerase that releases the
door latch (‘open’ state) and allows the new DNA 30
-end
to be repositioned within the RNA template and align-
ment regions for the next round of telomere synthesis.
This model is supported by cross-linking studies indicating
that the tTERT TEN domain is displaced relative to the
catalytic site during telomere synthesis in vitro (72).
A second prediction of this model is that the 50
-end of
the elongated DNA slides through the ssDNA-binding
groove on the surface of the TEN domain (Figure 3).
This movement is believed to signal telomerase
to re-establish the intramolecular protein–protein inter-
action (‘closed’ state) and initiate the next round of
telomere synthesis (74).
Processivity factors
In addition to anchor sites located within telomerase itself,
accumulating evidence suggests that telomerase-associated
proteins facilitate the enzyme’s repeat addition
processivity in vivo. For example, the TPP1–POT1
heterodimer stimulates the activity and processivity of
human telomerase in vitro (127–129). TPP1 has been
shown to interact with hTERT in vitro (128) and
mutation of a conserved glycine residue in the hTERT
TEN domain (G100) was shown to suppress the stimula-
tory eﬀect of TPP1–POT1 on human telomerase
processivity in vitro (129). These results are important
because they identify a physical link between the human
shelterin complex and telomerase, and provide new insight
into the mechanism of processive telomere synthesis.
One interpretation of these observations is that
5616 Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, No. 17
telomere-bound TPP1–POT1 interacts with hTERT to
transfer the telomeric ssDNA 30
-end to telomerase for sub-
sequent elongation. It will be interesting to elucidate
whether the interaction between hTERT and TPP1 is
direct or indirect (i.e. mediated by the telomeric ssDNA
primer) and to investigate the conformational changes
that occur in hTERT upon binding the TPP1–POT1 and
TPP1–POT1–ssDNA complexes. Identiﬁcation of the
TERT binding site in TPP1 should also help clarify the
relationships between telomerase, shelterin and telomeric
ssDNA.
How else might telomere-associated proteins contribute
to telomerase activity and repeat addition processivity
in vivo? It is possible that ssDNA-binding proteins, such
as RPA or POT1, coat the elongating telomere as it slides
through the TEN domain. This protein–DNA interaction
could stabilize and protect the otherwise naked ssDNA
and facilitate primer movement through telomerase. In
this model, telomere-binding proteins fulﬁll the
template-distal anchor site function. Another possibility
is that one or more telomerase-associated proteins
mediate anchor site function in vivo. In this regard, a
recent study of T. thermophila telomerase identiﬁed an
RPA1-like DNA-binding protein p82 in stable association
with the endogenous holoenzyme (130). Interestingly, p82
exhibits telomere sequence-speciﬁc ssDNA-binding
activity and confers ciliate telomerase with high levels of
repeat addition processivity in vitro (130,131). Recent ob-
servations suggest that the function of p82 may be to bind
the telomeric primer and stabilize its association with tel-
omerase as well as to suppress the formation of DNA
structures that could impede processive telomere synthesis
(131). It will be important to determine if repeat addition
processivity is regulated by similar proteins and mechan-
isms in other organisms. To this end, it will be useful to
devise puriﬁcation strategies that can be used to charac-
terize the composition of the telomerase holoenzyme at
various stages of the cell cycle and in diﬀerent organisms
and cell types. This would provide new insight into speciﬁc
factors that regulate telomerase biogenesis and activity
in vivo.
TELOMERASE, TELOMERES AND HUMAN
DISEASE
Many studies have illustrated the molecular complexity of
telomerase and telomere biology by implicating these
processes in a broad spectrum of human diseases,
ranging from cancer to premature aging disorders. This
area has been the focus of several excellent reviews
(132–134), and therefore, we will only brieﬂy summarize
the relationships between telomerase and human disease
to emphasize the clinical importance of understanding tel-
omerase biochemistry.
Telomerase, chromosome instability and cancer
Telomerase is active in germ line and stem cells but re-
pressed in most somatic cells and tissues, which is achieved
through various transcriptional and post-transcriptional
mechanisms (32,135). In the absence of telomerase
activity, telomeres shorten during each round of cell
division until they reach a critically short-length threshold
(136–138). This triggers a p53 and pRB-dependent DNA
damage response and induces a non-proliferative state
called replicative senescence, which is an important
barrier to tumorigenesis (139–142). Cells with defective
p53 and pRB pathways can bypass this barrier and
undergo additional 20–30 cell divisions (143,144).
During this extended period of proliferation, telomeres
continue to shorten and eventually undergo chromosome
end-to-end fusions (i.e. the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle),
which promotes genome instability by generating loss of
heterozygosity or the ampliﬁcation of genetic loci (132).
This usually triggers a second proliferative blockade called
crisis, which is characterized by massive genome instability
and apoptosis (145). However, rare clones (1 in 107
human cells) can emerge from crisis by up-regulating tel-
omerase or homologous recombination-based telomere
maintenance mechanisms called alternative lengthening
of telomeres (ALT), all of which stabilize critically short
telomeres and permit further rounds of cell division (146).
Telomerase activation is the most common pathway for
cellular immortalization and transformation; at least 85%
of human cancer cells constitutively express the telomerase
catalytic subunit and utilize telomerase-dependent
telomere elongation to attain unlimited growth potential
(147). Thus, telomerase is an attractive target for the de-
velopment of anti-cancer therapeutics that speciﬁcally
target cancer versus healthy cells (99). However, some
mammalian tumors and immortalized cell lines lack tel-
omerase activity and use ALT pathways for telomere
maintenance (146). A better understanding of these
non-telomerase telomere-maintenance pathways could
lead to novel anti-cancer therapies.
Diseases associated with telomerase deﬁciency
The ﬁrst disease-associated mutations in human telomer-
ase were identiﬁed in patients aﬄicted with a rare,
multi-system disorder called dyskeratosis congenita [see
Walne (148) for a historical review of dyskeratosis
congenita]. The clinical manifestations of dyskeratosis
congenita generally appear during childhood and include
a monocutaneous triad of abnormal skin pigmentation,
nail dystrophy and oral leukoplakia. These symptoms
are accompanied by a spectrum of other somatic
abnormalities, such as developmental delay, premature
hair loss and organ failure. Bone marrow failure is the
principal cause of premature mortality. More recently, tel-
omerase mutations have been detected in the context of
aplastic anemia (149–151), Hoyeraal–Hreidarsson
syndrome (152–155), idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis
(156,157) and liver disease (158). Aplastic anemia is a
hematological disorder characterized by reduced red
blood cell counts, bone marrow failure, and liver and
lung disease. Hoyeraal–Hreidarsson syndrome is a
multisystem disorder characterized by bone marrow
failure, immunodeﬁciency and severe growth retardation.
Idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis is a chronic, progressive,
and fatal disease that is deﬁned by irreversible lung
ﬁbrosis. The unifying molecular characteristic of these
Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, No. 17 5617
diseases is that patients harbor telomeres that are signiﬁ-
cantly shorter than age-matched control subjects (133).
This indicates that mutations in the telomerase holoen-
zyme compromise its ability to maintain telomere length,
which is thought to impair stem cell function and limit the
renewal capacity of highly proliferative cells. Indeed, in-
herited forms of dyskeratosis congenita exhibit disease an-
ticipation, whereby successive generations exhibit earlier
disease onset and present with more severe phenotypes
(159–161). The mechanism of disease anticipation is
thought to be caused by the inheritence of short telomeres
that continue to shorten at an accelerated rate in the af-
ﬂicted oﬀspring. Furthermore, patients aﬄicted with
dyskeratosis congenita are predisposed to developing car-
cinomas, lymphomas and leukemias. This is believed to
result from the accelerated rate of telomere attrition,
which promotes genetic instability and tumor formation.
Mutations have been detected in ﬁve subunits of the
human telomerase holoenzyme (TERT, TR, dyskerin,
NHP2 and NOP10) and one shelterin protein (TIN2)
[the reader is referred to the telomerase database
(http://telomerase.asu.edu/diseases.html) for a current
list of disease-linked mutations]. Dyskerin, NHP2 and
NOP10 are essential for the biogeneisis of human telomer-
ase and disease-linked mutant proteins have been shown
to compromise enzyme stability (162–165). Similarly, mu-
tations in hTR can either impair its stability or disrupt the
catalytic activity of human telomerase (88,159,166–168).
hTERT mutants exhibit catalytic defects in vitro and
fail to maintain telomere length in human cells
(84,87,88,150,161). Importantly, telomere maintenance
defects observed in cultivated human cells can be
rescued by the ectopic expression of wild-type hTR or
hTERT, providing direct evidence that these mutations
impair telomerase-mediated telomere maintenance
(150,163,169). However, a comprehensive study that de-
scribes how these mutations inﬂuence the biochemical and
cellular properties of human telomerase is not yet avail-
able. One possibility that has not been explored is that
some of these mutations interfere with enzyme activity
by disrupting critical protein–protein interactions within
the holoenzyme. It will be interesting to isolate human
telomerase from healthy and diseased cells and compare
the composition of the holoenzyme in these diﬀerent
cellular contexts. These experiments will provide novel
insights into the mechanism of telomerase regulation in
healthy and diseased human cells.
CONCLUSIONS
Telomerase has emerged as a central player in several
devastating human disorders, including various forms of
cancer, bone marrow failure and pulmonary ﬁbrosis. This
emphasizes the need for a detailed understanding of tel-
omerase structure and function. High-resolution crystal
structures of ciliate and insect TERTs provide
much-needed insight into the intricate details of this
unique RT. An important future challenge will be to de-
termine the crystal structure of TERT in complex with TR
and integral protein components of the telomerase
holoenzyme. This structural information will form the
basis for biochemical and molecular studies that could
provide important insights into telomerase assembly and
regulation. An equally important challenge will be to solve
the crystal structure of the full-length TERT from an
organism with well-characterized enzyme activity, espe-
cially in light of the controversy regarding the identity of
T. castaneum TERT. Finally, structure–function studies of
disease-associated TERT mutants will be particularly in-
formative since these mutations have abrogated amino
acids that are required for telomerase function in vivo.
The information obtained from these studies may ultim-
ately translate into novel therapeutic strategies that
improve the diagnosis, treatment and management of
human diseases associated with telomerase dysfunction.
