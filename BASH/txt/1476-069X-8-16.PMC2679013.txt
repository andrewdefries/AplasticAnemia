Abstract
Background: Land use regression (LUR) modelling is proposed as a promising approach to meet
some of the challenges of assessing the intra-urban spatial variability of ambient air pollutants in
urban and industrial settings. However, most of the LUR models to date have focused on nitrogen
oxides and particulate matter. This study aimed at developing LUR models to predict BTEX
(benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m/p-xylene and o-xylene) concentrations in Sarnia, 'Chemical
Valley', Ontario, and model the intra-urban variability of BTEX compounds in the city for a
community health study.
Method: Using Organic Vapour Monitors, pollutants were monitored at 39 locations across the
city of Sarnia for 2 weeks in October 2005. LUR models were developed to generate predictor
variables that best estimate BTEX concentrations.
Results: Industrial area, dwelling counts, and highways adequately explained most of the variability
of BTEX concentrations (R2: 0.78 – 0.81). Correlations between measured BTEX compounds were
high (> 0.75). Although most of the predictor variables (e.g. land use) were similar in all the models,
their individual contributions to the models were different.
Conclusion: Yielding potentially different health effects than nitrogen oxides and particulate
matter, modelling other air pollutants is essential for a better understanding of the link between air
pollution and health. The LUR models developed in these analyses will be used for estimating
outdoor exposure to BTEX for a larger community health study aimed at examining the
determinants of health in Sarnia.
Background
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are important out-
door air toxins suspected to increase chronic health prob-
lems in exposed populations [1,2]. BTEX (benzene,
toluene, ethylbenzene, (m+p) xylene and o-xylene) are
some of the common VOCs found in urban and industrial
areas and are classified as "hazardous air pollutants"
(HAPs) because of their potential health impacts [3].
Nonetheless, the evidence as to whether HAPs influence
health effects remains equivocal. For example, while
Leikauf [4] argued that there is insufficient evidence indi-
cating that ambient HAPs exposure has the potential to
exacerbate health problems such as asthma, the author
acknowledged that once an individual with a health out-
come (e.g. asthma) is sensitized to air pollution, they are
more likely to respond to remarkably low concentrations

of pollution. Furthermore, although low levels of VOCs
might have no significant health impacts, the interaction
between VOC species and other criteria pollutants might
cause adverse health outcomes. Rumchev et al. [5] studied
the linkages between domestic exposure to VOCs and
asthma in young children in Perth, Western Australia, and
found that exposure to VOCs increased the risk of child-
hood asthma.
Individual species within VOCs have also been examined
for their health effects. For instance, the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [6] has classified
benzene as a known human carcinogen based on evi-
dence from epidemiologic studies and animal data. These
studies have shown that exposure to benzene can cause
acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and other blood disor-
ders such as preleukemia and aplastic anemia [6,7]. The
US Department of Health and Human Services [8] also
reported an association between occupational exposure to
benzene and the occurrence of acute myelogenous leuke-
mia. In Australia, Glass et al. [9] found an association
between leukemia and cumulative benzene exposures
that were considerably lower than the accepted level.
Besides benzene, other BTEX compounds are also sus-
pected to adversely affect human health. The U.S. Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services [10] suggested that
exposure to high dosages of toluene may cause headaches,
sleepiness, kidney damage, and could impair an individ-
ual's ability to think clearly. Additionally, Chang et al.
[11] reported that toluene exposure could exacerbate
hearing loss in a noisy environment in Taiwan. While
studying the association between several sites of cancer
and occupational exposure to toluene in Montreal, Que-
bec, Gerin et al. [12] observed a doubling risk of esopha-
geal cancer in subjects exposed to medium to high levels
of toluene. Conversely, other studies that examined tolu-
ene as a possible risk factor for cancer did not find any sig-
nificant association between exposure to toluene and
cancer. For example, Antilla et al. [13] found no increase
in overall cancer risk for cancers at specific tissues associ-
ated with exposure to toluene, except for a non-significant
increase in the incidence of lung cancer in Finnish workers
who were exposed to toluene for more than 10 years.
The evidence on the health effects of Ethylbenzene
remains uncertain. Ethylbenzene has been linked to dizzi-
ness, throat, nose and eye irritations and recent laboratory
assessments have shown that long-term exposure to ethyl-
benzene may cause cancer [14,15]. While reviewing the
literature on the effects of low-level exposure to ethylben-
zene on the auditory system, Vyskocil et al. [16] reported
no evidence of ethylbenzene induced hearing loss after
combined exposure to ethylbenzene and noise of workers
in Quebec. In addition, acute exposure to xylenes could
cause respiratory and neurological health problems in
humans, while chronic exposure could affect the central
nervous system [17]. On the other hand, work by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services [18] provided
insufficient evidence showing that xylenes are potential
human carcinogens.
Although there is an understanding of the biological plau-
sibility linking hazardous pollutants in the ambient envi-
ronment to health effects, the evidence from toxicological,
occupational and epidemiological studies are still fre-
quently in discordance. This is partly due to different
methodological issues. For instance, the threshold con-
centrations used in animal studies are frequently above
those used in epidemiologic studies [4]. Also, researchers
have documented that ambient (outdoor) air pollution
concentrations used in epidemiologic studies may under-
estimate personal exposure because people spend most of
their time indoors [19-21]. Despite this recognition, the
argument is that the consistent pattern of outdoor air pol-
lution when compared to indoor air pollution [20,21]
means that outdoor exposure estimates may still be useful
for health studies where indoor air pollution data are una-
vailable. That is, outdoor air pollution estimates can be
used as estimates of overall pollution pattern especially in
highly polluted areas such as Sarnia where the correlation
between indoor and outdoor air pollution may be high as
a result of traffic and industry-related air pollution [22].
Hence, in the absence of indoor air pollution estimates,
outdoor exposure patterns are sufficient for health studies
[23].
The equivocal nature of the relationship between ambient
air pollution and associated health effects [4,24,25] may
be attributed to the challenges in the assessments of ambi-
ent air pollution for epidemiologic studies [26,27].
Recently, different approaches have been proposed and
utilized in addressing the challenges of estimating per-
sonal exposure to air pollution. For instance, kriging has
been used both at the national and regional scale [26], but
has been criticised for its inability to capture air pollution
at very short distances [28]. Other studies have used prox-
imity analysis and community average of pollution con-
centrations as proxies for exposure [29-31], however these
approaches have also been criticised because of their high
potential for exposure misclassification [32]. Microenvi-
ronment monitoring aims to address some of the expo-
sure assessment challenges [33], but its suitability has
been hampered by high costs related to data collection
especially when dealing with a large cohort [34]. Tradi-
tionally, dispersion models are also used to estimate indi-
vidual level exposure because they incorporate both
spatial and temporal variations without the need for addi-
tional air pollution monitoring. The biggest challenge
with dispersion models lies in their expensive data

demands and lack of precision in the requisite meteoro-
logical or emissions data required for making accurate
predictions [35,36]. Since exposure estimation can have
significant impacts on explaining relationships between
exposure and health outcomes [37-39], there is a growing
demand for improved and affordable ways of exposure
estimation that can potentially capture the variability of
air pollution for health studies in high polluted environ-
ments like Sarnia [32,40].
Land use regression (LUR) modelling is proposed as a
promising alternative approach to meet some of the chal-
lenges of assessing the intra-urban spatial variability of
ambient air pollutants in urban and industrial settings
because it can capture localized variation in air pollution
more effectively and economically than some of the con-
ventional approaches previously discussed
[32,35,37,40,41]. LUR modelling predicts outdoor ambi-
ent air pollution concentrations at given sites based on the
surrounding land use, traffic, population and dwelling
counts, and physical characteristics such as elevation [35].
Several researchers [26,27,35] have provided critical
reviews of LUR studies and emphasized the potential role
of LUR models in estimating exposure to air pollution.
However, most of the LUR models to date have focused
on nitrogen oxides (NO2 and NOx) and particulate matter
(PM2.5, PM10). With potentially different health effects,
modelling other air pollutants is essential for increasing
our understanding of the link between air pollution and
health. Consequently, the main objectives of this study
were to: 1) develop LUR models to predict VOCs, specifi-
cally benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m/p-xylene, o-
xylene, and total BTEX in Sarnia, and 2) determine the
intra-urban variations of ambient benzene, toluene, ethyl-
benzene, m/p-xylene, o-xylene, and total BTEX to be used
in a larger community health study.
Methods
Study area
The City of Sarnia (42° 58' N, 82° 22' W) is located in
southwestern Ontario, Canada, on the border just east of
Port Huron, Michigan, USA (Figure 1). Neighbouring
Canadian cities include London and Windsor. Sarnia has
an approximate land area of 165 km2 and a population of
71, 419 [42]. Both the city and surrounding communities
are called "Chemical Valley" because more than 40% of
Canadian chemicals are manufactured in this area [43].
Examples of the chemical industries in the area include
Suncor, Bayer, Dow Canada, NOVA, and ESSO. Further-
more, one of the largest landfill sites in Canada known as
Safety-Kleen is located in the region. These point sources
in Sarnia are amongst the largest industrial polluters in
Canada with the highest levels for some VOCs, such as 1–
3 butadiene, compared to other polluters across the coun-
try [44]. Recently, the Canadian government designated
the St. Clair region which includes Sarnia and 16 others as
"Areas of Concern" based on a hypothesis that environ-
mental pollution is negatively affecting the population in
these areas [43,45].
Data Collection – Pollution Monitoring
The BTEX species (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m/p-
xylene and o-xylene) were monitored using 3 M #3500
Organic Vapour Monitors (Guillevan, Montreal). Thirty-
nine samplers were deployed in Sarnia for 2 weeks in
October 2005 to coincide with a community health sur-
vey. The month of October best represents the average
annual weather condition in Sarnia. Although formal
location-allocation techniques [46] were not used, the
samplers were deployed based on a number of objective
criteria to capture the spatial variability of BTEX com-
pounds in areas of high population density. Samplers
were located proportional to population size in each cen-
sus tract. In addition, sites were selected to ensure suffi-
cient variability in potential predictors (e.g. land use, road
networks) (Figure 1). Hence, only 2 samplers were located
within Vidal Street, the main traffic route through the
industrial core, which served as the point of origin for the
measures for this study to capture pollution near service
areas. Vidal Street is called the industrial core because it is
the major traffic feeder to industries in Sarnia (Figure 1).
The rest of the sampling sites were at least 600 m away
from the industrial core to ensure data accurately reflected
diffused ambient pollution throughout the region rather
than point sources. The samplers were installed at a height
of 2.5 m on light poles after obtaining permission from
the City of Sarnia and the Aamjiwnaang Indian Reserve.
Global positioning systems were used to geocode the
monitoring locations.
The exposed filters were sent to Air Monitoring and Anal-
ysis(Mississauga, Ontario) lab for analysis of all measured
BTEX species. The samples were extracted with 2.0 mL of
solvent and the compounds determined using gas chro-
matography – mass selective detector with a detection
limit of 0.1 μg/L [47]. A multi-point calibration curve (r2
> = 0.99) was used and the results were corrected with lab
blank, deuterated internal standard and recovery. The
two-week BTEX measurements served as dependent varia-
bles in the developed LUR models.
Assessment of spatial trends
Sampling density was calculated as the number of sam-
plers divided by the study area. Kriging was used as the
spatial interpolation technique to examine how the differ-
ent BTEX species were spatially distributed based on the
sampling density. The spatial trends were examined using
ArcMap 9.2.

Variable generation
The predictors of BTEX species were extracted from several
datasets including traffic counts, census data, street net-
work, land use, and digital elevation models (DEMs). The
traffic counts were annual average daily traffic (AADT)
volumes collected in 2004 and compiled for major and
minor roads by the City of Sarnia, the Administration and
Engineering Department, and for highways by the
Ontario Ministry of Transportation. Both the city and pro-
vincial traffic data were then combined in GIS to establish
a comprehensive dataset for traffic counts based on road
segments. Population and dwelling counts at the dissem-
ination area (DA) level were generated from 2001 census
data [42]. The street network and land use 2006 datasets
were obtained from Desktop Mapping Technologies Inc
(DMTI) via the Data Liberation System from the Univer-
sity of Western Ontario. The street network file had infor-
mation on all three types of roads (minor, major,
highway) segment-by-segment. Digital elevation data
were used to generate the elevation for each sampled sta-
tion at a 25 × 25 m grid resolution (DMTI).
The independent variables were generated within circular
buffers that extended from the sampling locations at 50 m
intervals out to 3000 m using ArcGIS. The predictor varia-
bles were conceptually grouped into 4 different broad cat-
egories: land use, road and traffic, population and
dwellings, and physical geography. The land use category
included areas (in hectares) of industrial, commercial,
institutional, residential, open areas and water bodies that
fall within the specified buffer radii with sampling sites as
centres. The roads and traffic category included calculated
lengths of minor and major roads and highways; and the
total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) on the roads segments
that fall within the buffer radii. The VMT was calculated as
AADT counts multiplied by the road segment length
within a specified buffer. Calculated VMT values were
then summed as the total vehicle miles traveled for the
monitored station within the specified buffer. The total
population and dwelling counts were calculated as the
ratio of each DA that fell within a specified buffer area and
the total area of that DA multiplied by total population/
dwelling counts of their respective DA. Meteorological
data (e.g. wind direction) was not used in the analysis
because there was only one functional meteorological sta-
tion in the study area during the monitoring period. The
physical geography category included the x, y coordinates,
elevation, measured distances from monitoring stations
to Vidal Street (industrial core), the Blue Water Bridge,
minor and major roads and highways.
Model selection
The natural logarithm of BTEX species were used in the
LUR modeling because their distributions were skewed.
The association between the geographic variables and the
mean levels of measured air pollutants was analyzed
using multiple linear regression. Each of the buffers gen-
erated were individually screened through bivariate
regression models using SPSS statistical software [48] to
identify the variables that were highly correlated with
measured BTEX species. Next, the most relevant univariate
relationships were identified and then a stepwise multiple
regression was conducted to find the most predictive
models for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m/p-xylene,
o-xylene, and total BTEX (sum of all BTEX species). The
final LUR models for BTEX and each species were identi-
fied as having a combination of variables with the highest
coefficient of determination, R2. Independent variables
retained in the models had to have significant t-score (p <
0.05) and low collinearity with other variables (defined
by a variance inflation factor < 2.0).
After the most predictive models were obtained, the
standard regression diagnostics to identify outliers, lever-
age and influence values were performed. The individual
influence of each measured concentration on the whole
model was examined using the size-adjusted Cook's dis-
tance [49]. Points with calculated Cook's distance values
greater than the cutoff (defined as 4/sample size) were
removed because of their disproportionate influence on
the most predictive models. The residuals were tested for
Moran I (MI) spatial autocorrelation [50,51]. Pearson cor-
relations between significant independent variables in the
most predictive models were also examined.
Two different cross-validation procedures to evaluate the
precision of the optimized models were used. The first was
a "leave-one out procedure" which involved removing
one of the monitored sites and predicting the concentra-
tion at the omitted location [19,52]. This procedure was

repeated for all the sampling locations and the prediction
error calculated as root mean squared error (RMSE) – the
square root of the sum of the squared differences of the
observed and the predicted concentration at removed
locations [41]. A second cross-validation approach was
performed in three random selections of 90, 80 and 50%
of the samplers to predict BTEX concentrations at the
remaining 10, 20 and 50% locations, respectively [52,53].
The Chow test was used to determine whether the coeffi-
cients in the predictive regression models were similar to
the coefficients of the three different validation trials in
the second cross-validation [53,54].
The surfaces of predicted BTEX concentrations were cre-
ated by applying the coefficients of the predictive model
equation and generating predicted surfaces with a 5 × 5 m
resolution. The correlation between kriged and LUR mod-
eled BTEX concentrations were calculated for each sam-
pling site. All data management and statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS statistical software [48]. Spa-
tial autocorrelation and surface generations were per-
formed using ArcGIS 9.2.
Results
Two of the samplers were lost due to vandalism. The two
samplers were 600 and 2800 m away from the industrial
core and 8200 m apart. The calculated sampling density of
0.24 was higher than for other Canadian studies in Ham-
ilton (0.08), Toronto (0.16) and Montreal (0.18)
[32,53,55,56]. With the general distribution and sam-
pling density, the two lost samplers would likely have no
significant effect on the different BTEX models. Table 1
presents the summary statistics of the BTEX compounds
from the remaining 37 locations. Arithmetic means of the
compounds were 0.93 ± 0.56 μg/m3 for benzene, 2.58 ±
1.35 μg/m3 for toluene, 0.46 ± 0.23 μg/m3 for ethylben-
zene, 1.21 ± 0.61 μg/m3 for (m+p) xylene, and 0.49 ± 0.25
μg/m3 for o-xylene. Toluene was the most abundant com-
pound at all sampling sites followed by benzene.
Table 2 compares monthly (there were only 4 measure-
ments for the month of October 2005: 1st (Saturday), 7th
(Friday), 19th (Wednesday), and 25th (Tuesday)) and 5-
year (2001 – 2005) means of BTEX concentrations meas-
ured at the National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS)
station (#61004). The average ambient concentrations of
the 3 sampling points closest to the station (Figure 1) were
chosen for comparison following Atari et al. [55] and
Miller et al. [47]. In general, the 2-week average concentra-
tions of benzene (1.07 μg/m3), toluene (3.35 μg/m3),
ethylbenzene (0.56 μg/m3), and total BTEX (7.19 μg/m3)
at the 3 sampling points closest to the station were slightly
lower than the monthly and 5-year means measured at the
NAPS station (Table 2). The 2-week average concentra-
tions of (m+p) xylene (1.43 μg/m3) and o-xylene (0.58
μg/m3) measured at the 3 sampling points closest to the
station were slightly higher than the monthly and 5-year
means measured at the NAPS station. The differences
could be attributed to the fact that (m+p) xylene and o-
xylene are more photochemically reactive than their coun-
ter parts [57], and different measuring instruments were
used. Environment Canada used 6 Litre Summa canisters
at the NAPS stations [58] while 3 M samplers were used in
this study.
The measured BTEX species are highly correlated to each
other (Table 3). The kriged surfaces of measured BTEX
concentrations showed similar patterns with high concen-
trations along the industrial core. Because of the high cor-
relation between BTEX species and their similar patterns
in the kriged surfaces, only two surfaces are shown (Figure
2). The benzene surface has a slightly more localized pat-
tern when compared to the other BTEX species. Table 4
shows the Pearson correlation coefficients between meas-
ured, kriged and LUR modelled concentrations at the
sampling locations. The correlation between measured
and kriged concentrations were low for ethylbenzene (r =
0.38), (m+p) xylene (r = 0.16) and o-xylene (0.14). Like-
wise, the correlation between kriged and LUR modelled
concentrations at the sampling locations were low for
ethylbenzene (r = 0.46), (m+p) xylene (r = 0.31) and o-
xylene (r = -0.19). Kriged o-xylene concentrations were
consistently lower than the LUR modelled concentrations
at the sampling locations.

(MI = -0.03) residuals of the most predictive models indi-
cate no significant autocorrelation. Table 5 shows the
final LUR models for predicting the concentrations of
benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, (m+p) xylene, o-xylene,
and total BTEX. The model for benzene (R2 = 0.78)

included industrial land use within 1600 m, dwelling
counts within 1200 m, and length of highway within 800
m. The model for toluene had an R2 of 0.81 including
industrial land use within 2800 m, open area within 600
m, and length of highway within 800 m as significant pre-
dictors. The model for ethylbenzene (R2 = 0.81) included
industrial land within 2600 m, dwelling counts within
1400 m, and length of highway within 800 m. The model
for (m+p) xylene and o-xylene had similar R2 of 0.80
including industrial land use within 1600 m, dwelling
counts within 1200 m, and length of highway within 800
m. The total BTEX model had a coefficient of determina-
tion (R2) of 0.81 including industrial land use within
2500 m, dwelling counts within 1400 m, and length of
highway within 900 m showing significant contribution
to the model. The positive regression coefficients indicate
that concentrations of BTEX compounds increase as the
values of the independent variables (e.g. industrial area)
rise, while the negative coefficients indicate a decrease in
concentrations as the values of the predictor variables (e.g.
area of open space) increase. All variables in the six mod-
els are significant at the 95% level of confidence. None of
the variables in the final models were significantly corre-
lated with each other (Table 6).
Figure 3 shows the relationship between the observed and
predicted pollutants based on their natural logarithmic
scales. The scatterplots reflect the strength of each of the
developed models and demonstrate that the models fit
the observations well with no significant outliers. The spa-
tial pattern of the predicted BTEX species concentrations
showed expected characteristics (Figure 4) compared to
their kriged surfaces. The predicted surfaces reflected the
significant variables with industrial area, dwelling counts
and traffic showing significance. The numerous petro-
chemical industries along the industrial core and dwelling
counts showed significant influences on the modelled
surfaces. The predicted surfaces have more detailed varia-
bility compared to the kriged surfaces of measured con-
centrations.
The results of the validation approaches are provided in
Table 5. The BTEX root mean square error predicted in this
study were somewhat lower than the average estimated
error of 1.72 – 2.15 μg/m3 for BTEX concentrations
reported by Aquilera et al. [19] who used similar
approaches for cross-validation. Overall, the predicted
benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, (m+p) xylene, o-xylene,
and total BTEX concentrations correspond nicely with
measured concentration suggesting that these models are
capable of predicting reliable concentrations. The Chow
test results were not significantly different between the
predictive models and the three different tests suggesting
that the benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, (m+p) xylene, o-
xylene and total BTEX models developed were quite sta-
ble.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to model the intra-urban varia-
tions of ambient VOCs including benzene, toluene, ethyl-
benzene, (m+p) xylene, o-xylene, and total BTEX for use
in a large health study aimed at examining the determi-
nants of health in sentinel high exposure environments.
Although most of the significant variables were similar in
the six models, their individual contributions to the mod-
els were significantly different. For example, while indus-
trial land use within 1600 m was significant in both
(m+p) xylenes and o-xylene models, the effect of industry

(34% and 53%, respectively) differed in the two models
(Table 5). These differential influences support the need
for modelling the different air pollutants [55].
When compared to other LUR models developed in
Munich [59], El Paso [60], Sabadell [19] and Windsor,
Ontario [61], the significant variables in the present study
showed considerably larger buffer radii. For example,
Wheeler et al. [61] reported significant highway buffer
radii of 50 m and 100 m for benzene and toluene models,
respectively. In this study, we found significant highway
buffer radii of 800 m for both benzene and toluene mod-
els (Table 5). The later result was also larger than the 300
m buffer radius reported by Beckerman et al. [62] when
examining the variability of traffic-related pollutants
around an expressway in Toronto, Ontario. The differ-
ences could be due to the unusually large number of pet-
rochemical facilities in Chemical Valley, hence the
broader distribution of ambient air pollutants in the area.
The larger buffer radii found in this study potentially lim-
its the generalizablility and transferability of the devel-
oped LUR models to areas of similar contextual and
compositional characteristics [26].
When compared to other models developed in Sabadell
[19], Munich [59], and Windsor, Ontario [61], the results
of the various models of BTEX species are considerably
different, further suggesting the need to model air pollut-
ants in their various contexts rather than depending on
proxies [37,55]. The benzene model (R2 = 0.78) showed
comparable coefficient of determination when compared
to a similar model developed in Munich, Germany (R2 =
0.80) [59] but slightly higher than the R2 of a model devel-
oped in Windsor, Ontario, Canada (R2 = 0.73) [61]. The
toluene model showed high coefficient of determination
(R2 = 0.81) compared to similar models developed in
Windsor (R2 = 0.46) [61] and Munich (R2 = 0.76) [59],
while the coefficient of ethylbenzene (R2 = 0.81) was com-
parable to the coefficient reported in Munich (R2 = 0.79)
[59]. The BTEX model developed in this study showed
high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.81) as compared
to an R2 of 0.74 reported by Aquilera et al. [19] in
Sabadell, Spain. Differences in the R2 could be due the
contextual factors in the various cities. Although the
industrial area exhibited varying influences in each of the
models (Table 5), the results support the view that the
numerous petrochemical industries are significantly
affecting the VOC concentrations in Sarnia, Chemical Val-
ley. If possible, it is important to model each air pollutant
of interest to better analyse, determine, and understand
personal exposures for health studies.
Besides industrial area, dwelling counts also emerged as a
strong determinant of the intra-urban variation of BTEX
concentration in Sarnia (Table 5). These results are con-
sistent with other researchers [46] who found dwelling
counts to influence the intra-urban variation of air pollu-

tion. The view is that high dwelling counts may influence
heavy traffic and emissions [63]. The results also indicate
that a combination of land use and dwelling counts could
be used to estimate exposure to air pollution, especially
BTEX compounds.
The correlations between BTEX species in this study
showed slightly different coefficient ranges compared to
other studies in Canada and the US [62,64]. This research
has slightly narrow coefficient ranges (0.76 – 0.99) (Table
3) compared to the coefficient ranges (0.53 – 0.89)
reported in Toronto, Canada [62]. The difference could be
due to the numerous petrochemical industries in the
region. While examining the concentration and co-occur-
rence of VOCs in the US, Pankow et al. [64] reported com-
parable correlation ranges (0.78 – 0.99) between BTEX
species. The high correlation coefficients in this study sug-
gest that BTEX species are emitted by similar sources and
it might be possible to monitor only one or two of BTEX
species in Sarnia [47].

When compared to the measured concentrations (Table
4), kriging showed higher correlation coefficients (0.71 –
0.99) compared to the LUR modelled concentrations
(0.14 – 0.79) for BTEX and all its individual components.
The LUR models showed high correlations with measured
concentrations for benzene (r = 0.79), toluene (r = 0.72),
and BTEX (r = 0.61) but considerably lower correlation
coefficients for ethylbenzene (r = 0.38), (m+p) xylene
(0.16) and o-xylene (r = 0.14). When the kriged concen-
trations were compared to the LUR modelled concentra-
tions at the monitoring sites, benzene (r = 0.83), toluene
(r = 0.73), ethylbenzene (r = 0.51), and BTEX (r = 0.66)
showed significantly higher correlations compared to
(m+p) xylene (r = 0.31) and o-xylene (r = -0.19). The LUR
models underestimated o-xylene concentration at the
sampling locations compared to kriging. The correlation
results suggest that LUR modelling could be an efficient
interpolator for benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene but

not for xylenes in a highly polluted area like Sarnia. The
effectiveness of kriging in Sarnia may be due to the
uniqueness of the area. As mentioned, Sarnia is a rela-
tively small region with about 40% of Canada's chemicals
manufactured in the region [43].
Similar to other LUR studies, the benzene, toluene, ethyl-
benzene, (m+p) xylene, o-xylene, and total BTEX models
were developed based on a two-week monitoring cam-
paign. The high network deployment, monitoring, and
chemical analysis cost did not permit an extensive moni-
toring campaign. In spite of the short-term monitoring,
the models developed captured the intra-urban variability
of total BTEX and its associated species in Chemical Val-
ley. When compared, the 2-week measured concentra-
tions at the 3 sampling locations closest to the National
Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) station had compara-
ble patterns with the monthly and 5-year average concen-
trations at the station suggesting that the measured
ambient BTEX concentrations in this study were reliable.
Hence, although seasonal variations may affect the tem-
poral trend of modelled air pollution concentration, sea-
sonality would have little influence on the spatial and
geographic patterns of pollution because of the numerous
petrochemical facilities in the region [53,55,63,65]. Sub-
sequently, seasonal variation may not greatly influence
chronic health outcomes because, as observed in this
research, the 2-week concentrations adequately represent
mean annual concentration in Sarnia (see also Lebret et al.
[65])
Conclusion
Despite the potential limitations of this research, includ-
ing the short-term monitoring campaign, the develop-
ment of LUR models is a relatively affordable approach
that clearly offers an advantage over traditional exposure
estimation methods such as dispersion models [35]. From
the models developed, it is evident that in addition to
industrial emissions, traffic related VOC pollutions can-
not be ignored in Chemical Valley and in similar indus-
trial areas. Because of their prevalence and potential to
cause adverse health outcomes, it is crucial to model

VOCs such as BTEX for increasing the research communi-
ties understanding of the link between air pollution and
health. The modeled ambient air pollution surfaces gener-
ated in this study suggest that some residents may be dis-
proportionally exposed to high air pollutants. The results
suggest the need for environmental policies that help
reduce industrial pollution and assist residents to reduce
and cope with daily industrial exposures. The LUR model-
ling of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, (m+p) xylene, o-
xylene, and total BTEX models are used to estimate per-
sonal exposure for a large community health study aimed
at examining the determinants of health in a government
labelled area of concern.
