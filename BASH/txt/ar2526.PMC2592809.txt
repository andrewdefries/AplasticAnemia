Abstract
Introduction Bone marrow oedema (BME) and avascular
osteonecrosis (AVN) are disorders of unclear origin. Although
there are numerous operative and non-operative treatments for
AVN, pain management in patients with AVN remains
challenging. Prostaglandins play an important role in
inflammatory responses and cell differentiation. It is thought that
prostaglandin I2 ([PGI2] or synonoma prostacyclin) and its
analogues promote bone regeneration on a cellular or systemic
level. The purpose of this study was to assess the curative and
symptomatic efficacy of the prostacyclin analogue iloprost in
BME and AVN patients.
Method We are reporting on 50 patients (117 bones) affected
by BME/AVN who were treated with iloprost. Pain levels before,
during and 3 and 6 months after iloprost application were
evaluated by a visual analogue scale (VAS). The short form(SF)-
36 health survey served to judge general health status before
and after treatment. Harris Hip Score (HHS) and Knee Society
Score (KSS) were performed as functional scores and MRI and
X-rays before and 3 and 6 months after iloprost application
served as objective parameters for morphological changes of
the affected bones.
Results We found a significant improvement in pain, functional
and radiological outcome in BME and early AVN stages after
iloprost application, whereas patients with advanced AVN
stages did not benefit from iloprost infusions. Mean pain level
decreased from 5.26 (day 0) to 1.63 (6 months) and both HHS
and KSS increased during follow-up. Moreover, the SF-36
increased from 353.2 (day 0) to 560.5 points (6 months). We
found a significant decrease in BME on MRI scans after iloprost
application.
Conclusions In addition to other drugs, iloprost may be an
alternative substance which should be considered in the
treatment of BME/AVN-associated pain.
Introduction
Avascular osteonecrosis (AVN) is a common and multifactorial
disease, It has a high incidence, estimated to be 15,000 cases
of AVN in the femoral head per year in the USA [1]. Frequent
risk factors include trauma, steroid therapy or hypercortison-
ism [2-4], alcohol abuse and different coagulopathies, for
example, activated protein C (APC) resistance, protein S defi-
ciency, prothrombin mutations and hyperhomocysteinaemia
[5,6]. There are also several rare factors associated with
osteonecrosis, such as systemic infection diseases (eg, HIV)
[7,8], storage diseases (eg, Gaucher disease) [9], metabolic
disorders (eg, hyperuricaemia, hyperlipidaemia) [10,11], sickle
cell anaemia [12], aplastic anaemia [13], autoimmune disor-
ders (eg, systemic lupus erythematodes [SLE], rheumatoid
arthritis, Behcet's disease) [14], shock and septic syndromes
[15], smoking [16], diving [17] and chronic inflammatory
bowel diseases. Furthermore, chemotherapy and radiation
increase the risk of AVN manifestation in cancer patients [18].

It was shown by Ito and colleagues [19] that there is a corre-
lation between pain and the extent of bone marrow oedema
(BME) and that BME is the most significant risk factor for
worsening pain. At the time of diagnosis, it is not clear if it is a
distinct self-limiting transient condition (ie, BME syndrome,
transient osteoporosis) [20-23], a form of reflex sympathetic
dystrophy or an early stage of AVN [24]. In addition, subchon-
dral BME is also present in other pathological conditions (eg,
tumours, trauma, osteomyelitis) and is also frequently found in
osteoarthritis.
Although there is consensus about the different vascular fac-
tors that contribute to BME and AVN, the pathogenesis and
cause of pain remain unclear. However, the occurrence of
associated AVN risk factors, distinct MRI findings, such as a
subchondral area of low intensity of at least 4 mm in thickness
and 12.5 mm in length, and a prolonged BME for more than
11 weeks correspond to the diagnosis AVN [25].
Advanced stages of AVN can be diagnosed by x-rays showing
sclerotic and/or osteolytic areas. Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is very sensitive in identifying and characterising BME
and AVN in the early stages [26].
The success of different treatment concepts is strongly
dependent on the stage of the disease, as classified by the
Association Circulation Osseous (ARCO) (Table 1) [27-30].
The treatment options are limited and the long-term prognosis
is poor, particularly in advanced bone necrosis. Thus, early
diagnosis and rapid, effective treatment are essential. Con-
servative management consisting of symptomatic therapy has
been recommended, especially in cases of BME. It is thought
that prostaglandin I2 ([PGI2] or synonoma prostacyclin) and its
analogues promote bone regeneration on a cellular or sys-
temic level.
Preliminary promising results in the literature [31-37] and in
our own experience [38,39] encouraged us to conduct a pro-
spective study to investigate the curative potential and analge-
tic efficiency of the vasoactive prostacyclin analogue iloprost.
The stable prostacyclin analogue iloprost is approved for treat-
ment of critical ischaemia occurring secondarily to peripheral
arteriosclerotic obliterative disease of diabetic angiopathy
(intermittent claudication). Furthermore, iloprost is adminis-
tered as an inhalative for patients with pulmonary arterial
hypertension [40]and the application of iloprost in systemic
sclerosis is currently under investigation in clinical trials [41].
Other rare indications for iloprost are severe bone pain caused
by sickle cell crisis [36], Raynaud's phenomena [42] and SLE
[42,43]. Moreover, it has been shown that iloprost improved
preservation in organ storage in transplantation surgery for
heart, liver, lungs and kidneys [44,45].

Materials and methods
Patients
Between October 2002 and December 2005, 61 patients
with painful BME or AVN (mean (SD) age = 45.9 (14.9) years;
range = 11 to 76 years) were treated with iloprost. According
to the study protocol, we carried out a prospective, MRI-con-
trolled observational study on 50 patients (mean age = 45.2
(14.2) years; range = 24 to 76 years; sex ratio: 22 men to 28
women) with symptomatic AVN or painful BME. The average
body weight was 73.5 (14.1) kg and the mean height was
172.0 (9.4) cm. All AVN were associated with an almost dis-
tinctive BME, which showed a high variability in extent and was
not evaluated separately.
Patients aged between 18 and 80 years with painful BME and
additional AVN risk factors or BME persisting for more than six
months or AVN stage greater than ARCO I were included in
the study. Patients were excluded if they had acute or chronic
infections or hypertension with systolic values higher than 160
mmHg, or those who had ischaemic heart attacks or cerebral
ischaemia/bleeding within the past six months or surgery
within the past six months or bleeding disorders, or if the
women were pregnant or breastfeeding. Based on MRI scans,
x-rays and clinical examinations, patients with osteoarthritis,
joint instabilities and axis deformities 10° more than the statis-
tical normal were also excluded. The study protocol was
approved by the local Ethics Committee (local ethical commit-
tee of the Heinrich-Heine-University, Düsseldorf, trial number:
2355) and included written informed consent according to the
Declaration of Helsinki in its present version.
Parameters
Iloprost (Ilomedin; Schering AG, Germany) was dissolved in
0.9% saline solution and applied intravenously over a period of
six hours per day in a weight-related schedule for a total of five
days (Table 2).
Based on medical history and clinical examination, the Harris
Hip Score (HHS), the Knee Society Score (KSS) and assess-
ment of pain level on a visual analogue scale (VAS) served for
evaluation during a follow-up of up to six months. The VAS is
classified from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain). Moreover the
short form (SF)-36 health survey was used to assess patients'
health status. It is the short form of an instrument developed
for the Medical Outcome Study and contains 36 items that
can be aggregated to eight scales [46].
In addition to clinical parameters, plain radiographies in two
standard planes (one when weight bearing) and MRI scans
(T1 weighted, T2 weighted and short T1 inversion recovery
(STIR) weighted) were performed for radiographic analysis by
a blinded independent radiologist (DB) (parameters: ARCO
stages, extent of BME: progression, persistence, regression).
Table 2 shows the infusion scheme and table 3 gives an over-
view of the study design (Table 3).
Any side effects and adverse events were recorded. Unevent-
ful effects during or after iloprost therapy were recorded and
classified as severe (hypotension, arrhythmia, bleeding, throm-
boembolism, myocardial insufficiency, acute respiratory dis-
tress syndrome, pulmonary oedema, allergic reactions with
systemic clinical signs, shock) and minor (flush, erythema,
headaches, nausea) side effects.
Statistical analysis
Student's t-test for independent statistical groups was used
for statistical analysis: p < 0.01 was highly statistically signifi-
cant, p < 0.05 was statistically significant and p > 0.05
showed no significance. The average values, standard devia-
tions and the range from minimum to maximum readings
served as descriptive parameters at follow-up examinations.
Connections between the different parameters were recorded
and determined by linear regression analysis.

Results
Overall, 117 bones (98 joints) in patients in this study were
affected by BME or AVN before treatment. Figure 1 shows the
regional distribution and ARCO stages of the 50 patients in
this study. Considering medical history, we found different
associated risk factors for BME and AVN: nicotine abuse (10
patients), steroid medication (25 patients), trauma (four
patients), hyperlipoproteinaemia (three patients), activated
protein C resistance (one patient) and chemotherapy (one
patient). No risk factors were found in 26 patients (idiopathic
AVNand BME). We found different AVN stages on MRI and x-
ray evaluations in two standard planes. Classified by ARCO,
there were 82 ARCO I bones, 20 ARCO II bones, 13 ARCO
III bones and two ARCO IV bones.
No severe adverse effects were observed in any patients dur-
ing intravenous iloprost administration. In two patients, severe
headaches occurred on infusion day four and led to early ter-
mination of iloprost therapy. We observed one thrombophlebi-
tis at the injection site, which was treated with antiseptic

patches and healed within four days. Flushes or erythemas
occurred from day three in 90% of patients during infusion.
Iloprost showed a highly significant reduction in the level of
pain evaluated by VAS during intravenous application within
five days starting from 5.3 (sd = 2.0; range = 2 to 10) before
treatment (day 0) to 2.5 (sd = 1.7; range = 0 to 6) on average
at day five. There was still an improvement in pain three and six
months after infusion corresponding to a pain level on the VAS
(At three months = 2.0; sd = 2.1; range = 0 to 8: At six months
= 1.6; sd = 1.8; range = 0 to 7) but the reduction in pain in
this period was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Starting
at day three, about 60% of all patients reported intermediate
"gnawing and dull" sensations in the affected bones during ilo-
prost application. These dysesthesias disappeared spontane-
ously within six hours when infusion was stopped. Figure 2
shows the outcome in pain over a six months of follow up.
There was a highly significant improvement in the mean HHS
from 52.6 points (sd = 16.5 points; range = 23 to 84 points)
before treatment to 73.6 points (sd = 17.9 points; range = 39
to 99 points) after three months and 79.9 points (sd = 21.9;
range = 26 to 100 points) after six months. In the period
between three and six months after iloprost infusion, the HHS
improvement was not significant (p > 0.05) as shown in figure
3. Furthermore, the KSS increased from 112.8 points (sd =
28.5 points; range = 60 to169 points) to 154.7 points (sd =
26.2; range = 100 to 190 points) at three months and to
186.4 points (SD = 14.3; range = 158 to 200 points) at six
months (figure 4).
Corresponding to a better functional outcome and a signifi-
cantly lower pain level in BME and AVN patients, quality of life
evaluated by SF-36 score showed significant improvement
during and after iloprost infusion (figure 5). The average (sd)
values for SF-36 were 353.2 (12.3) points before treatment,
483.7 (8.3) points three months after infusion and 560.5
(10.2) points six months after iloprost application. A highly sig-
nificant improvement was seen in physical functioning, role
physical, bodily pain, social functioning, role emotional and
mental health before and after six months of iloprost infusion,
and the general health and vitality scales showed a significant
improvement. However, after three months we found no signif-
icant improvement in vitality and general health, and there was
a reduction in mental health scores from month three to six
with no significance.
The clinical findings during follow-up correspond to the MRI
findings. After three and six months, MRI scans showed a sig-
nificant decrease in the extent of BME. Overall, 65 of 117

affected bones were free of BME within six months of iloprost
application. In contrast to a significant decrease in BME and
early AVN stages, advanced AVN stages (ARCO III and IV)
were not influenced by iloprost; however, in some patients
with ARCO stages III and IV iloprost showed an analgetic
effect. Figures 6a and 6b and table 4 show detailed data of
MRI follow up after iloprost application and figure 7 shows
MRI findings of two typical patients with BME before and after
iloprost infusion.

tion between pain level reduction and functional outcome, life

quality and reduction of BME in MRI scans. The correlation
coefficient between pain and the HHS was -0.99, between
pain and the KSS it was -0.96, and between pain and the SF-
36 it was -0.91. There were no substantial iloprost-mediated
effects on joint cartilage in standard MRI sequences.
Discussion
During intravenous treatment with the prostacyclin analogue
iloprost, a highly significant reduction of pain in patients with
BME and/or AVN could be demonstrated. Moreover, iloprost
showed a non-significant but progressive reduction of pain
through to the last follow-up examination. As shown in the
results, the anti-oedema effects of iloprost were dependent on
the ARCO stage of the AVN. Patients in early ARCO stages I
and II especially benefited from iloprost application with
respect to pain relief, functional outcome and BME reduction.
Although iloprost has a short half-life in vivo of about 25 min-
utes, the clinical and MRI findings were not only short-term
effects but lasted until the final follow up at six months after
application. The high number of patients with multifocal AVN
(50 patients, 117 bones) in our study is partly due to the fact
that 20% of individuals underwent kidney transplantation. All
of these patients developed a multifocal painful BME ('post-
transplant distal limb syndrome') [47].
Our results correspond to the data from other investigators.
Disch and colleagues [35] reported on 16 patients with BME
and 17 patients with AVN of the proximal femur who were
treated with iloprost. They demonstrated a significant improve-
ment in functional outcome measured by HHS (p < 0.001), a
reduction in extent of BME and pain relief over 12 weeks. In
another study, Aigner and colleagues [32] investigated the
effects of intravenously applied iloprost on 38 hips with BME
in the femoral head and compared these results with core
decompression. The iloprost group achieved better results
after a mean follow-up of 11 months. After iloprost application,

pain at rest was no longer present within a mean of eight days
and pain during exercise took four weeks to normalise. Meizer
and colleagues [37] reviewed 104 patients with painful BME
after intravenous iloprost therapy over four months in an MRI-
controlled study. At follow-up, pain reduction was detected in
64% of all patients and 65% of the subjects had a significant
reduction in BME size or complete normalisation. Also other
recent study supported the effectiveness of prostaglandin
(PG) I2 analogue iloprost in BME and/or AVN [39,48,49].
As an alternative treatment concept, some authors report
good results after core decompression, based on the theory
that AVN-associated pain is due to elevated intramedullary
pressure [16,50,51]. Although core decompression can lead
to rapid and complete relief from symptoms and resolution of
the changes seen on MRI, some authors underline the periop-
erative risks including fractures, damage to cartilage, persist-
ing haematomas and local infections. In addition, six weeks of
partial or no-weight-bearing and physiotherapy are usually
required after core decompression. Based on histological

studies, there is a high failure rate to achieve the correct posi-
tion of the drill channels after femoral head core decompres-
sion [20,23,52]. It is not possible to control and define the
destination of the drill wires in early stages of AVN and BME
using fluoroscopy, so the risk of dislocation is especially high
in these stages. Considering the data from Wang and col-
leagues [53] extracorporeal shock-wave therapy may be
another therapeutic option in the treatment of AVN-associated
pain, but it can also induce AVN as reported by Durst and col-
lagues [54]. In particular, the high energy extracorporeal
shock-wave application on bones is associated with pain
caused by microtrauma or microfracture and haematoma and
requires sufficient anaesthesia during treatment [55].
The pharmacokinetic effects of iloprost that lead to better per-
fusion in tissue with a critical blood supply are multiple. It
induces vasodilation and has an impact on rheological proper-
ties of the terminal vascular bed [56]. Moreover, it reduces
capillary permeability, inhibits platelet aggregation and dimin-
ishes the concentration of free oxygen radicals and leukot-
rienes [57-60]. However, the pharmacological effects that are
responsible for the relief of pain and a decrease in BME are
not yet known and remain controversial. It is unclear if the pain
relief and reduction in extent of BME during and after iloprost
application are primarily based on a normalisation of intraos-
seous pressure or on interactions with local leukotrienes and
cytokines.
From a molecular point of view, the G-protein-coupled prosta-
noid IP receptor plays a crucial role in the prostacyclin-
induced effects. Activation of IP receptors may result in pain
sensation, inflammatory responses, inhibition of platelet aggre-
gation and vasodilation in vascular tissue [61]. Furthermore, it
has been shown that prostacyclin (PGI2) is an important medi-
ator implicated in bone metabolism which acts via the kinase
A-pathway as a potent inhibitor of bone resorption and medi-
ates bone modelling [62]. Although the specific effects of
PGI2 on its IP receptor are well documented, there are few
data available in the literature about the distribution of IP
receptors in human bone. Fortier and colleagues [62]
detected IP receptors in fetal and adult osteoclasts and oste-
oblasts. In contrast to fetal osteocytes, adult osteocytes do not
express the IP receptor. Moreover adult osteoblasts lose the
IP receptor when these cells are trapped in the bone matrix. As
demonstrated by Fortier and colleagues [62], IP receptors
show a perinuclear distribution in osteoblasts, but are not fre-
quently seen in multinuclear osteoclasts. Furthermore, there is
no difference in the expression of IP receptors in pagetic, oste-
oporotic and normal bone. Aubert and colleagues [63] demon-
strated that IP receptors play a crucial role in preadiposing cell
stimulation and differentiation. Figures 8 and 9 give a sche-
matic overview of some PGI2-mediated effects.
The IP receptor plays an important role in rat dorsal root gan-
glion (DRG) neuron sensitisation, which is measured by the
release of the neurotransmitter substance P. Nakae and col-
leagues [64] showed that the IP antagonist 2-[4-(1H-indol-4-
yloxymethyl)-benzyloxycarbonylamino]-3-phenyl-propionic
acid (compound A) inhibits the accumulation of the second
messenger cAMP in the rat osteosarcoma cell line and primary
cultured rat DRG neurons without affecting other eicosanoid
receptors and leads to an iloprost-induced reduction in the
release of substance P.
The interpretation of an osteoblast-protective effect caused by
the prostacyclin analogue iloprost and its clinical relevance for
pain relief in AVN is critical because the molecular pathways
are complex. Other agents, such as the stable analogue car-
bacyclin (cPGI2), BMY 45778 and cicaprost, are also potent
agents with IP-receptor binding properties and may influence
pain [63,64].
The results of this study and our experience with more than 60
BME patients showed that pain associated with BME and
AVN can sufficiently be reduced by iloprost application. Our
findings confirm those of other investigators that iloprost has a
curative potential in ARCO I and early II AVN stages in adults.
Although children with early stages of AVN have been suc-
cessfully treated with iloprost in a pilot study [65], it is unclear

if this vasoactive drug would be appropriate in healing juvenile
AVN (eg, Perthes' disease).
Cartilage damage classically occurs late in AVN in response
to mechanical strain caused by fracture of the subchondral
sequestrum. Therefore, the joint space in conventional x-rays
remains normal for longer in AVN patients compared with
those with osteoarthritis. To prevent progression of AVN that
may result in an early total joint replacement, we recommend
an early MRI diagnosis to detect BME or early-stage AVN in
cases of joint pain of unknown origin. In MRI, BME appears as
high-signal intensity on T2-weighted images, best seen if fat
suppressed, and as low-signal intensity on T1-weighted
images. In early studies, these findings were described as a
diffuse or homogeneous pattern of AVN, but lesions are often
uncharacteristic, particularly in an early stage [27,29]. An inter-
face between areas of osseous resorption and healing is often
present on MRI and is referred to as the double-line sign. The
sign is created by a high-signal intensity line, representing
hyperaemic tissue, immediately apposed to a low-signal inten-
sity line, representing sclerotic bone. This characteristic MRI
sign is seen in irreversible early-phase AVN, representing
stage II of the ARCO classification (Table 1). MRI has been
found to be the most sensitive method of detecting the pres-
ence of early AVN [26,66,67].
However, there is controversy about whether BME represents
a distinct self-limiting disease (also known as transient oste-
oporosis), transient marrow oedema or merely reflects a sub-
type of AVN. The diagnosis of BME syndrome can only be
made retrospectively, regardless of whether a progressive
AVN or a BME syndrome will follow subsequently. Consider-
ing the similar clinical presentation of BME and AVN and the
high variance in prognosis and therapeutic consequences
between self-limiting BME syndrome and progressive AVN,
we recommend applying iloprost with preference in BME
patients with additional AVN risk factors or in persisting and
painful BME.
We showed that osteonecrosis-associated pain can be
treated sufficiently by the prostacyclin-analogue iloprost. Ther-
apy in bone BME and AVN was only promising in early AVN
stages (ARCO I and II). In addition to other drugs, iloprost may
be an alternative substance that should be considered in the

treatment of BME and osteonecrosis-associated pain. Further
controlled clinical studies are needed to show if iloprost has
any effects on joint cartilage and to investigate if osteoarthritis-
related BME is an indication for future application of PGI2 and
related molecules. Appropriate MRI sequences such as
dGEMRIC, which not only allow evaluation of bone-related
effects but may also help to detect molecular changes within
the complex cartilage histo-architecture, should be used in fur-
ther investigations.
Conclusion
Iloprost improves the functional and radiological outcome in
patients with BME. However, advanced AVN stages (≥ ARCO
II) are irreversible and iloprost is not potent enough to heal the
osteonecrotic areas. Although the individual risk for severe
side effects during iloprost treatment is low when the dosage
is adapted to the body weight, contraindications should be
considered carefully.

(red) factors and are mainly mediated by Smad proteins. Based on recent studies it can be assumed that not only the TGFβ/BMP, the Wnt/beta-
catenin, the Notch pathway or direct gene activations by steroids but also prostaglandins are involved in osteoblast differentiation. Prostacyclin and
its related molecules, such as iloprost, play a crucial role in various cellular mechanisms and control intracellular signals: the IP receptor mediates the
actions of its ligand via Gs (or Gq, G11, Gi) protein activation leading to adenylate cyclase activation followed by an intracellular increase of cAMP.
Moreover, the human IP receptor gene presents various bindings sites such as glucocorticoid response element (GRE) and it can be concluded that
glucocorticoids also regulate its expression. In addition, the human EP receptors with its various subtypes such as EP1–4 and their isoforms are also
activated by iloprost. One major EP-related effect is the mobilisation of intracellular Ca2+ but also a down-regulation of intracellular cAMP concentra-
tion as described for the EP4 receptor. However, the complex intracellular effects that are triggered by iloprost and the importance in osteoblast dif-
ferentiation are poorly understood to date.
