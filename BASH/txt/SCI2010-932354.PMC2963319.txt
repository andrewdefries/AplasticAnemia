Aplastic anemia (AA) is a heterogeneous disorder of bone marrow failure syndrome. Suggested mechanisms include a primary
stem cell deﬁciency or defect, a secondary stem cell defect due to abnormal regulation between cell death and diﬀerentiation,
or a deﬁcient microenvironment. In this study, we have tried to investigate the alterations in hematopoietic microenvironment
and underlying mechanisms involved in such alterations in an animal model of drug induced AA. We presented the results
of studying long term marrow culture, marrow ultra-structure, marrow adherent and hematopoietic progenitor cell colony
formation, ﬂowcytometric analysis of marrow stem and stromal progenitor populations and apoptosis mechanism involved in
aplastic anemia. The AA marrow showed impairment in cellular proliferation and maturation and failed to generate a functional
stromal microenvironment even after 19 days of culture. Ultra-structural analysis showed a degenerated and deformed marrow
cellular association in AA. Colony forming units (CFUs) were also severely reduced in AA. Signiﬁcantly decreased marrow
stem and stromal progenitor population with subsequently increased expression levels of both the extracellular and intracellular
apoptosis inducer markers in the AA marrow cells essentially pointed towards the defective hematopoiesis; moreover, a deﬁcient
and apoptotic microenvironment and the microenvironmental components might have played the important role in the possible
pathogenesis of AA.
1. Introduction
Aplastic anemia (AA) is an acquired disease characterized
by an extremely hypocellular marrow and peripheral blood
pancytopenia due to chronic depression of hematopoiesis in
the bone marrow [1–3]. The exact causes and mechanisms
involved in the bone marrow failure in aplastic anemia
is still not quite steadily explained; however, it is clear
that acquired aplastic anemia is a heterogeneous disease
caused by diﬀerent pathophysiological conditions [4, 5]. The
possible pathophysiological conditions that account for AA
include decreased hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) number,
impaired hematopoietic stem cell function, and increased
bone marrow cellular apoptosis level and the functional
and structural defects in the bone marrow hematopoietic
microenvironment and several microenvironmental compo-
nents [6–9].
Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell renewal and growth
have long been discussed to be under the control of
various cytokines and growth factors released by the marrow
hematopoietic microenvironment [10]. Within the marrow
cavity the mystery of stem/progenitor cell health has been
found to be critically dependent on microenvironmental
components which are of varied and diverse nature [11–
13]. Recent studies have revealed that the hematopoietic
bone marrow microenvironment is heterogeneous in respect
to bone lining osteoblasts, ﬁbroblasts, multilaminar and
branched stromal barrier cells, and the reticuloendothelial
2 Stem Cells International
cells [14, 15]. Indeed, the normal hematopoiesis requires a
complex interplay between the hematopoietic cells and the
marrow microenvironment which is necessary for switch-
ing on several proliferation and diﬀerentiation signaling
cascade [16–18]. One of the hallmarks of aplastic anemia
is the deﬁcient functioning of the hematopoietic system
and the hematopoietic microenvironment. Several studies
have shown that the number of primitive hematopoietic
progenitors (capable of hematopoiesis in long-term marrow
cultures) is drastically reduced in the vast majority of patients
with AA. Furthermore, when long-term marrow cultures
(LTMC) were established from the aplastic anemic bone
marrow, the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors have
been found to sustain only for few days and that also at
very low levels. Thus, it is clear that severe quantitative
and qualitative alterations exist within the compartment of
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and in some cases, also
within the hematopoietic microenvironment in the disease
AA [19–22].
Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is increased in sev-
eral hematological disorders characterized by bone marrow
failure. The ﬁne equilibrium between the diﬀerentiation and
apoptosis of normal hematopoietic cells get altered in AA.
The exposure to nonphysiological programmed cell death
could deregulate this equilibrium, resulting in excessive and
uncontrolled apoptosis of hematopoietic cells in AA [23–
27]. Indeed, it has been suggested that this mechanism
of unregulated cell death is the cause of poor production
of hematopoietic cells and an ineﬀective hematopoiesis
in AA [28]. Furthermore, the normal bone marrow cells
require certain viability factors, produced by the marrow
microenvironment, to remain viable and undergo apoptosis
when these factors are withdrawn. Thus, the reduced viability
factors production by the marrow microenvironment can
also be a contributing problem to the proliferation defect
and/or the excessive apoptosis of the bone marrow cells in
AA [29–33].
The objective of the present study was to investigate the
quantitative and qualitative alterations in the hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cell compartment, bone marrow stromal
hematopoietic microenvironment and several microenvi-
ronmental components in an animal model of drug-
induced aplastic anemia. The objective further included the
study of bone marrow cells from aplastic anemic mice in
terms of clonogenic functional potential and the apoptosis
signaling pattern in AA. The following four approaches
were used: (1) analysis of the marrow microenvironment
through long term bone marrow explant culture (LTBMC-
Ex) system, scanning electron micrographs of the mar-
row ultrastructure and the colony forming eﬃcacy of the
marrow adherent stromal cells, (2) determination of the
deviation in the clonogenic potential of the bone mar-
row derived cells in the aplastic anemia compared to the
normal controls through semisolid colony forming assay,
(3) ﬂowcytometric characterization of the stem (Sca1+c-
kit+) and stromal (Sca1+CD44+) progenitor cell population;
(4) evaluation of the bone marrow cellular apoptosis level
with subsequent alterations in the expression proﬁle of
several extracellular apoptosis marker (CD95/APO-1) and
intracellular (pASK-1, pJNK, Cleaved Caspase-3) apoptosis
inducer proteins under the event of the disease AA. On
the basis of the above-mentioned observations, here, we
have reported alterations in the physiological status of the
stromal microenvironment in AA. Impaired proliferation,
diﬀerentiation and increased cellular apoptosis in the aplastic
anemic bone marrow have also been revealed. The present
paper hoped to provide new insights in better understanding
the underlying mechanisms that are involved in the initiation
and progression of the disease AA.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Animals and Disease Induction. Inbred swiss albino mice
of mixed sexes for both the normal control (n = 20) and
experimental (n = 20) groups were housed in controlled
room temperature of 25◦
C in the ﬁlter top cages on normal
diet and water ad libitum. Twenty weeks old mice weighed
to approximately 20–22 gms received 20 mg/kg body weight
busulfan and 80 mg/kg body weight cyclophosphamide
intraperitoneally on day 0th and 28th, respectively. Controls
received comparable volumes of saline [34–37].
2.2. Blood Hemogram Proﬁle. Twelve weeks after the second
injection approximately 200–300 μL of blood was collected
by tail vein puncture from each of the experimental and
normal control groups of animals using heparinized vials.
The hemoglobin concentration, white blood cells (WBCs),
red blood cells (RBCs) counts, platelets, reticulocytes, and
neutrophils counts were determined using standard labora-
tory techniques.
2.3. Isolation of Bone Marrow. Twelve weeks after the second
injection those experimental group of mice which showed
progressive disease status were sacriﬁced to isolate the long
bones (femur and tibia). Bone marrow was ﬂushed out
from the above-mentioned bones by a syringe containing
RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). Some portions of the isolated marrow were
cut into small pieces (approximately 0.2 mm3) and kept in
media containing FBS for further culture protocol and for
preparations of the sample for scanning electron microscopy.
The rest of the bone marrow was mixed well with repeated
pipetting and passed through cell strainer to isolate single
cells. The isolated single cells were then depleted of RBCs
using RBC-depletion buﬀer (BD-Biosciences, USA). Finally
the cells were kept in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with
FBS.
2.4. Long-Term Bone Marrow Culture. Isolated small
0.2 mm3 fragments of the bone marrow explants were
subjected to culture in triplicate (for each of the normal
and experimental groups) in 75 mm culture dish (Corning,
USA) containing 4 mL of RPMI-1640 supplemented with
30% FBS. The culture medium also consisted of 1% bovine
serum albumin (BSA), 10−4 M 2-mercaptoethanol, and
100 ng/mL recombinant mouse (rm) stem cell factor (SCF)
(E-Biosciences, USA), 50 ng/mL rm Interleukin-3 (IL-3)
Stem Cells International 3
(BD-Biosciences, USA) and 50 ng/mL rm granulocyte-
macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (BD-
Biosciences, USA). The cultures were incubated at 37◦
C in
an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. At diﬀerent time course
the cultures were monitored and cellular growth pattern was
observed and photographed under the inverted microscope
for both the normal and experimental groups.
2.5. Sample Preparation and Scanning Electron Microscopy. A
small portion of the intact marrow tissue from each of the
normal control and experimental aplastic groups were kept
in 2.8% gluteraldehyde overnight for ﬁxation. To dry the
tissue it was repeatedly passed through 30%, 50%, 70%, and
100% gradients of alcohol and ﬁnally critical point drying
was done. Then, after coating with gold (Au) in IB-2 ion
coater, the coated samples went through scanning electron
microscopic examination using S-5330 Hitachi SEM and the
photographs were recorded.
2.6. Bone Marrow Adherent Cell Colony Formation. For the
bone marrow adherent cell colony formation, the bone
marrow-derived cells were suspended in RPMI-1640 media
at a concentration of 4 × 106
cells/plate, supplemented
with 30% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin,
100 U/mL streptomycin and 0.01% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol.
Four 75 mm petridishes each for the experimental and
control groups were plated with 4 mL of media containing
4 × 106
cells and placed in a CO2 incubator at 37◦
C
and 5% CO2. At every 72 hours interval, the media was
drained oﬀ and fresh media supplemented with 30% FBS and
0.01% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol added for the maintenance
of the culture. After 14th, 19th, and 25th days of culture
the numbers of colonies were scored using an inverted
microscope.
2.7. Hematopoietic Colony Assays. Hematopoietic progen-
itor cells were assayed in methylcellulose-based semisolid
cultures. The culture medium consisted of 1.2% methyl-
cellulose, 30% FBS, 1% BSA, 10−4 M 2-mercaptoethanol,
and 100 ng/mL recombinant mouse (rm) stem cell factor
(SCF), 50 ng/mL rm Interleukin-3 (IL-3) and 50 ng/mL rm
granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-
CSF). RBC-depleted bone marrow cells were plated at a
ﬁnal concentration of 5 × 105
cells/mL in triplicate and
the cultures were incubated at 37◦
C in an atmosphere of
5% CO2 in air. After 16 days of culture, colonies were
scored in the same dish using an inverted microscope.
Hematopoietic colonies were classiﬁed as follows: CFU-
E, erythroid colonies containing 25–50 hemoglobinized
cells; BFU-E, erythroid colonies containing more than 50
hemoglobinized cells grouped in one or several clusters.
Myeloid colonies comprised the identiﬁable subpopula-
tions of pure granulocytic colonies (CFU-G), colonies
containing both granulocytes and macrophages (CFU-GM).
Mixed type of colonies containing both the erythroid and
myeloid cells (CFU-GEMM) and the nonhematopoietic
colonies of adherent ﬁbroblastic cells (CFU-F) were also
found.
2.8. Flow Cytometric Analyses of Cell Surface Marker Expres-
sion. Flow cytometry was used to detect the expression of
combination of markers that are associated with Hematopoi-
etic stem cells (HSCs) (Sca1+c-kit+) and stromal progen-
itor cells (Sca1+CD44+) [38] under normal and diseased
condition. Bone marrow cells were washed and ﬁxed with
3% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Then brieﬂy, in one tube 1 ×
106
, PFA ﬁxed cells were treated with 2 μL each of mouse
anti-Sca1 PE and anti-c-kit FITC conjugated monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) (BD-Biosciences, USA). In another tube,
1 × 106
PFA ﬁxed cells were treated with 2 μL each of mouse
anti-Sca1 PE and anti-CD44 FITC (BD-Biosciences, USA)
conjugated mAbs. All the tubes were incubated in dark at
37◦
C for 30 minutes. Finally, the cells were washed in PBS
and analyzed by BD FACS calibur (Becton-Dickenson, USA),
using cell quest pro software (v9.1 Becton Dickenson, USA).
2.9. Bone Marrow Cellular Apoptosis Study. Two diﬀerent
aspects of the bone marrow cellular apoptosis proﬁle were
monitored in two sets of experiment. The following two
approaches were used: (1) expression level of the extracellular
apoptosis marker like CD95/APO-1 on bone marrow cells
from the normal control as well as the experimental aplastic
groups and (2) expression levels of the intracellular apoptosis
inducer proteins like pASK-1, pJNK, and Cleaved Caspase-3
on the bone marrow cells from the normal control as well as
the experimental aplastic groups.
(a) For the ﬁrst protocol, brieﬂy 1 × 106
PFA ﬁxed bone
marrow cells were incubated with 2 μL of mouse anti
CD95 PE conjugated mAb (BD-Biosciences, USA) in
dark at 37◦
C for 30 minutes. Finally, the cells were
washed and analyzed by BD FACS calibur (Becton-
Dickenson, USA), using cell quest pro software (v9.1
Becton Dickenson, USA).
(b) For the intracellular pASK-1, pJNK and cleaved
caspase-3 analysis approximately 3 × 106
bone
marrow-derived cells were mixed with 1.5%
paraformaldehyde. Cells were incubated in ﬁxative
for 10 min at room temperature and pelleted. They
were then permeabilized by resuspending with
vigorous vortexing in 500 μL ice-cold methanol
per 1 × 106
cells and incubated at 4◦
C for 15–20
minutes. Cells were then washed twice in staining
media (PBS containing 1% BSA) and divided in
three diﬀerent sorting tubes containing staining
media at concentration of 1 × 106
cells per 100 μL.
Then accordingly, 2 μL of rabbit anti-mouse pASK-
1, pJNK, and cleaved caspase-3 primary mAbs
(Cell Signaling Technologies, USA) were added
to the respective labeled tubes and incubated for
30 minutes at room temperature followed by the
addition of goat anti rabbit secondary antibody
conjugated with Alexa Fluor-488 (Invitrogen, USA)
to each of primary antibody containing tubes
and incubated further for 30 minutes at room
temperature. The cells were then washed with 15
volumes of staining media and pelleted. Finally,
the pellets, were resuspended in respective tubes

day 16 of culture, the cells from the normal bone marrow produced a coordinated network of mature stromal matrix of ﬁbroblastic cells
upon which small hematopoietic cellular colony formation can be noticed. (h) After 16 days of the culture, the cells from the aplastic bone
marrow failed to generate a functional stromal matrix that can sustain hematopoiesis with abundance of immature giant stromal precursors

appearance of large hematopoietic colonies associated with it, compared to the aplastic marrow where no such functional stromal matrix
formation with associated cellular colony generation was observed (j).

2.10. Statistical Analysis. Statistical analysis was performed
by using Student’s t-test, with P < .05 accepted as statistically
signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Blood Hemogram Proﬁle. In order to conﬁrm the
progressive clinical status of the disease in the experimental
AA group of mice, blood hemogram proﬁle including
hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell (WBC) count,
red blood cell (RBC) count, neutrophils, platelets and
reticulocytes counts were determined. The results showed
a moderate to severe depression in the blood hemoglobin
concentration in AA (11.14 g/dl) compared to the normal
(15.99 g/dl). Total blood cell corpuscular counts were also
severely reduced with uniform reduction in the reticulocyte
count in AA (0.22%) compared to the normal (0.89%). Total
WBC, RBC, and neutrophils counts were also decreased in
the experimental AA group of mice (WBC-3.1 × 103
/μL,
RBC-4.2 × 106
/μL, Neutrophils-9.95%) compared to their
normal counterparts (WBC-6.2×103
/μL, RBC-8.44×106
/μL,
Neutrophils-22.75%).
3.2. Long-Term Bone Marrow Culture. To analyze the marrow
hematopoietic microenvironment and speciﬁc microenvi-
ronmental components that are essential for maintaining
normal hematopoiesis, long-term bone marrow explant cul-
tures (LTBMC-Ex) provide the systematic model to demon-
strate normal bone marrow microenvironmental associa-
tions and its alterations in the bone marrow failure diseases
like AA. The normal bone marrow explant showed healthy
cell generation at day 3 of culture (Figure 1(a)) compared to

the aplastic marrow that showed stunted cell generation pat-
tern (Figure 1(b)). After 7 days of culture, the normal explant
showed eﬃciency of stromal matrix formation (Figure 1(c))
compared to that of AA where the explant appeared to
be distorted and fragile with almost no cellular generation
(Figure 1(d)). At day 11 of culture, the cells released from
the normal bone marrow created stromal matrix throughout
the diﬀerent areas of the culture dish distal from the
explant (Figure 1(e)) compared to the AA bone marrow
that showed no such stromal matrix generation with pre-
dominant appearance of immature stromal precursors and
stromal ﬁbroblasts (Figure 1(f)). At day 16 of the culture, the
cells from the normal bone marrow generated an organized
network of mature stromal matrix of ﬁbroblastic cells upon
which small hematopoietic colony formation can be noticed
(Figure 1(g)) in comparison with the cells form the AA
bone marrow that failed to generate a functionally mature
stromal matrix that can sustain hematopoiesis (Figure 1(h)).
After 19 days of culture, the normal marrow generated
stromal matrix appeared to be even more coordinated with
appearance of large hematopoietic colonies associated with
it (Figure 1(i)), compared to the AA marrow where no
such functional stromal matrix formation was observed with
frequent appearance of large immature stromal precursors
and stromal ﬁbroblasts (Figure 1(j)).
3.3. Scanning Electron Micrographs of Bone Marrow Ultra-
structure. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of the
normal and AA bone marrow exhibited convincing dif-
ferences in their microenvironmental ultrastructure. The
scanning electron micrographs of the normal bone marrow
(Figure 2(a)) represented a well-organized compact cellular
structure and intracellular association between the stem
and stroma in the normal marrow microenvironment.
Scanning electron micrographs from the AA bone marrow
(Figure 2(b)) showed an overall scanty and degenerative
marrow with no such intertwined stem-stroma structure and
distorted cellular components with frequent appearance of
apoptic holes.
3.4. Bone Marrow Adherent Cell Colony. The quantitative
distribution chart of the bone marrow adherent cell colony
numbers (Figure 3) displayed that colony forming ability of
the bone marrow adherent cell population from the aplastic
group of mice was always low in number compared to that
of the normal control group throughout the days of culture.
The quantitative distribution chart showed that after day 14
and 19 of culture, the experimental AA groups of animals
had mean values only 15% and 33% of the control mean
(P < .02), respectively. After day 25 of culture, the colony
numbers still decreased and the mean value for AA was found
to be only 21% of the control mean (P < .02). The overall
mean value of adherent bone marrow cell colony numbers in
AA was only 26% of the control mean (P < .02).

characterization of stromal progenitor cell marker (Sca1 and CD44) expression by the normal (c) and aplastic (d) bone marrow cells depicted
depletion in the stromal progenitor cell population in aplastic anemia.
3.5. Colony-Forming Assay. Colony-forming eﬃciency of the
bone marrow derived cells from the normal and aplastic
anemic groups of mice depicted an overall decrease in
colony-formation by the AA bone marrow progenitor cells in
comparison with the normal marrow progenitors. Colony-
forming unit erythrocytes (CFU-E) (Figure 4(a)), erythroid
burst forming unit (BFU-E) (Figure 4(b)) showed an overall
decrease in AA that indicated a signiﬁcant (P < .01) decrease
in mature erythrocyte formation. Colony forming unit
granulocytes (CFU-G) (Figure 4(c)), colony forming unit
granulocytes macrophages (CFU-GM) (Figure 4(d)), colony
forming unit granulocyte erythrocyte monocyte macrophage
(CFU-GEMM) (Figure 4(e)) documented a moderate to
severe (P < .01) decrease in AA indicated a dysfunction of
the marrow stem/progenitor cells in terms of their ability
to multilineage diﬀerentiation in AA. Colony forming unit
ﬁbroblasts (CFU-F) also showed a decrease (P < .01) in
AA with respect to the normal value (Figure 4(f)) which
was well correlated with the deﬁcient stromal function
observed through long-term marrow culture. All the results
represented the relative number of CFUs in aplastic anemia
as compared to the normal and corresponded to the median
± S.D. levels observed from 15 (n = 15) samples studied
(P < .01).
3.6. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Surface Receptor Expres-
sion. Phenotypic characterization of Sca1 and c-kit receptor
expression by bone marrow primitive stem cells indicated
a highly downregulated Sca1+c-kit+ cell population in the
AA group of animals (0.90%) (Figure 5(b)) compared to the
normal controls (8.68%) (Figure 5(a)).
Further, the phenotypic characterization of the bone
marrow-derived stromal progenitor (Sca1+CD44+) cells
demonstrated a depressed stromal progenitor population

in the AA group (9.16%) (Figure 5(d)) compared to the
normal (33.38%) (Figure 5(c)). The results documented a
signiﬁcant downregulation in both the stem and stromal
progenitor cell population in AA bone marrow which was
highly correlated with what we have observed through long-
term bone marrow culture and colony forming eﬃcacy of the
bone marrow-derived progenitors in AA.
3.7. Cellular Apoptosis Study. Bone marrow cellular apopto-
sis proﬁle was monitored by means of two diﬀerent aspects.
(a) High extracellular CD95 expression was evidenced
on the bone marrow-derived cells of AA group
(28.21%) (Figure 6(b)) compared to the normal
(4.66%) (Figure 6(a)) that indicated an enhanced
bone marrow cellular apoptosis level in AA which was
well correlated with the decreased stem and stromal
progenitor population in AA.
(b) Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular apoptosis
inducer protein levels in normal and aplastic bone
marrow cells showed an increased intracellular apop-
totic protein expression levels in AA compared to
the normal. Data was presented here as median
value of ﬂuorescence intensity along the X-axis.
Aplastic bone marrow cells showed a signiﬁcant
increase in intracellular p-ASK1 (Figure 7(a)), p-JNK
(Figure 7(b)) and Cleaved Caspase-3 (Figure 7(c))
levels as compared with the normal marrow cells. The
results represented an increased intracellular apop-
tosis inducer protein expression pattern in aplastic
anemia which was signiﬁcantly correlated with our
previous data of increased Fas-R (CD-95) expression
on the AA bone marrow cells.
4. Discussion
The pathogenesis of AA still remains obscure. Although
several other studies suggested that the microenvironmental
defects might have play a role in the progression of bone
marrow failure in AA, but the exact mechanism was not
clear. We have used long-term bone marrow explant culture
as a useful tool to assess the stromal microenvironmental
defect in AA. Long-term bone marrow culture represents
the most physiologic system for assessing growth and
proliferation of the bone marrow cells in vitro. As the
proliferation kinetics of the hematopoietic bone marrow
cells are dependent on the complex interaction between the
hematopoietic cells and a conﬂuent stroma, so our system
to study stroma and assess the functional capacity of the
stromal components represented a more physiological in-
vitro monitoring system. In this paper, we have primarily
assessed the stromal (adherent) functional eﬃcacy and
the hematopoietic ability of the AA bone marrow cells
through long-term marrow culture and colony forming
eﬃcacy of the bone marrow-derived cells, respectively. In
culture, the normal bone marrow explant showed healthy
cellular generation pattern with subsequent development of
a functional stromal matrix that could sustain hematopoiesis
in the long term. In sharp contrast to the normal scenario,
the AA bone marrow explant documented a stunted cell
growth characteristic with almost no sign of formation of
a functional stromal adherent layer. However, 20% of AA
bone marrow explants exhibited a moderate marrow stromal
adherent layer formation but that also declined rapidly with
days of progression of culture with concurrent decrease in
the number of nonadherent and committed progenitor cells
than did the normal controls that implied a defect in either
the stem cells level or in the capacity of marrow stromal cells
to support hematopoiesis. Using long-term bone marrow
explant culture we demonstrated a defect in the regenerative
capacity of not only the hematopoietic cells but also the
supportive stroma. Our result clearly showed a defective
proliferative capacity of the AA bone marrow cells in culture.
The defective hematopoiesis may have resulted from either
the failure of the stromal microenvironment to produce
growth factors essential for hematopoiesis or the absence

of proper growth factor receptors on the AA bone marrow
cells.
Bone marrow ultrastructural analysis depicted a degen-
erative marrow compartment in AA. The composite normal
cellular organization was totally absent in AA bone marrow
with frequent abundance of apoptic pits within it. The
structural integrity of the bone marrow microenvironment
which is essential for maintaining normal hematopoiesis was
found to be totally lost in AA. The disorganized marrow
microenvironment hinted at the “microenvironment depen-
dent degeneration of normal hematopoiesis” in AA.
Our study demonstrated a signiﬁcantly lowered level of
colony formation by the adherent (stromal) bone marrow
cell population in AA. This data constituted another piece
of evidence for the existence of stromal defect in AA. Taking
into consideration the leading role of stromal cells in regula-
tion of early HSC function, the stromal cell dysfunction may
be critical for inhibition of hematopoiesis in AA.

Inhibitory eﬀects of AA hematopoietic microenviron-
ment were also evidenced with signiﬁcantly low CFUs form-
ing ability by the marrow hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells in AA. The decreased values of CFU-E, BFU-E, CFU-
G, CFU-GM, and CFU-GEMM essentially pointed towards a
residual defect in the marrow hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cell compartment in terms of clonogenic potential in AA.
The defect could have originated either from the hematopoi-
etic stem/progenitor cell level or from the nonhematopoietic
stromal cell level depending on their physiological crosstalk
in the hematopoietic microenvironment. The extended dis-
cussion of this fact might include two fundamental points:
(1) a functionally impotent stroma-dependent inhibition of
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell proliferation and (2) an
impairment in the physiological maturation and cell surface
receptor expression in the hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells that are essential for maintenance of the cells in the
hematopoietic microenvironment.
Functionally abnormal ﬁbroblasts have been docu-
mented in AA. The marrow ﬁbroblasts showed defective
production of ﬁbroblast colony forming unit (CFU-F) in
AA. The decreased CFU-F further hinted at the defective
microenvironmental stromal ﬁbroblast function. However,
the size and concentration of CFU-F was found to be
increased in AA (Figure 8(b)) compared to the normal
(Figure 8(a)). This paradoxical data might account for the
marrow compensatory mechanism and result of additional
mitosis due to the activation of stromal precursor cells
to support the mesenchymal cells under stressed marrow
condition in AA.
The ﬂow cytometric analysis of bone marrow cells rep-
resented a quantitative loss in both the stem (Sca-1+c-kit+)
and stromal (Sca-1+CD44+) progenitor population in AA.
Though the study represented here mainly focused on co-
evaluation of the defects of intertwined microenvironmental
components, yet we have speciﬁcally quantiﬁed the isolated
bone marrow stem and stromal progenitor cells as these
components are designated the most essential and integral
units of the hematopoietic microenvironment. The sharp
decrease in the stem and stromal progenitor population
provided the required supportive base to explain the actual
event of deranged hematopoiesis in AA.
Apoptosis or programmed cell death (PCD) is the most
discussed pathophysiologic mechanism associated with the
aplastic disease progression. The pathophysiology of apopto-
sis has only recently been identiﬁed, but there is substantial
evidence that disturbance of mechanisms controlling cell
death may play an important role in the diseases associated
with abnormal cell death and/or cellular proliferation. The
relationship between the apoptosis and the aplastic disease
progression is reversible; that is, the increased bone marrow
cellular apoptosis leads to the increased occurrences of
Stem Cells International 11
the disease aplastic anemia. In this present paper, we
wanted to throw light on some apoptosis regulators (both
the extracellular transmembrane receptor protein (CD-95)
and the intracellular apoptosis inducer proteins like p-
ASK-1, p-JNK, and cleaved caspase-3) that played a major
role in controlling normal cellular apoptosis and their
subsequent alterations in AA. The aplastic anemic bone
marrow cells showed an increased transmembrane CD95
(Fas-R) expression. The increased Fas-R expression resulted
in higher rate of apoptosis in AA. The interpretation of
the increased expression of Fas-R on the AA bone marrow
cells might include two points: either (1) there was an
increment in the levels of inhibitory factors secreted by the
stromal microenvironment that potentially induce apoptosis
by acting as ligands to Fas-R or (2) there was an immune-
mediated destruction of marrow cells by contact-mediated
transmembrane signaling that has been shown to involve
the surface molecule Fas-R (CD95) on target bone marrow
cells and its ligands on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The
increased FasR-FasL interaction then potentially switched on
the apoptosis signaling pathway by activating (phosphory-
lating) several intracellular apoptosis inducer proteins such
as ASK-1, JNK, and caspase-3 in a stage speciﬁc manner. In
our study, we have speciﬁcally analyzed these activated forms
of intracellular proteins that is, pASK-1, pJNK, and cleaved
caspase-3, and we have obtained an increased level of all the
activated proteins in the bone marrow cells in AA. The result
obtained has helped us to understand the apoptosis pathway
involved in AA (Figure 9).
In conclusion, we can say that the AA bone marrow docu-
mented alterations with respect to certain components of the
stromal microenvironment, including the defect in ability
to support normal hematopoiesis, adherent cell colony
formation and CFU-F formation. Simultaneously, the stem
cell population also seemed to be severely aﬀected in aplastic
anemia with decreased clonogenic potential as evident from
CFU formation and ﬂow cytometric analysis. Long-term
bone marrow culture revealed the inhibitory eﬀects of the
stromal microenvironment that were responsible for the pro-
liferative defects in the hematopoietic cells. The alterations in
the stromal microenvironment possibly accounted most for
the pathogenesis of AA. Accordingly, we suggest that further
investigations into the stromal microenvironment and the
stromal components in AA would be necessary for better
understanding the mechanism of the disease.
