Surgical Oncology. YOSEF H. PILCH, USA,
McGraw-Hill, 1119 pp, 1984, £90.50, ISBN
007049997.
Professor Pilch has gathered together an impressive
number of distinguished North American
contributors to produce this enormous work which
covers the whole spectrum of malignant diseases for
which surgery is the mainstay of treatment.
It begins with a useful introduction for those
clinicians whose knowledge of the basic concepts of
oncology is perhaps a little rusty. This section
includes amongst others, chapters on
Environmental carcinogenesis, Tumour cell biology
and kinetics, Tumour immunology, Viruses in
cancer, Monoclonal antibodies and Radiation
biology and oncology. It concludes with chapters
on the physiological aspects of malignant disease
and the design of controlled trials.
The main bulk of the book consists of detailed
reviews of the rationale for care and management
of specific malignancies together with alternatives.
Malignant disease of the head and neck, thorax,
breast, abdominal cavity, genito-urinary tract are
extensively covered as are tumours of the brain and
musculo-skeletal system. The final chapters are
concerned with the management of pain, the para-
neoplastic syndromes and rehabilitation and
reconstruction in patients with malignant disease.
As always when a work of this size is produced
the bibliography lacks the most up-to-date
references and there are few included that are later
than 1979. In an attempt to overcome this problem
many of the chapters have an additional "selected
bibliography" covering papers appearing in the 2 or
3 years prior to publication of the book but which
are not discussed in the text.
My criticisms are few. The X-ray plates have not
all reproduced well and some have been cropped
too closely to allow easy interpretation. The
operative diagrams in the chapters on the
nasopharynx and especially the larynx are very
poor.
This book is primarily a reference book for
surgeons and, provided the North American bias is
taken into account, makes excellent post graduate
reading for those studying for their surgical
diploma. It has a limited appeal however to those
in non-surgical disciplines.
Surgical Oncology is a comprehensive work that
should make a valuable addition to any post
graduate library but at £90.50 is unlikely to find
favour with the individual pocket.

Immune-Deficient Animals-4th International
Workshop on Immune-Deficient Animals in
Experimental Research, Chexbres 1982. Ed. B.
SORDAT. Basel, Karger Press, XIV +446 pp, 1984,
$117, ISBN 3 8055 3741 7.
This book, the Proceedings of a Workshop held 2
years ago, is divided into six sections, each headed
by a position paper followed by, for the most part,
short papers on detailed experimental studies. From
the first section on natural resistance in these
animals, immunologists will be pleased to learn that
immune-deficient rodents are capable of generating
as much complexity (and work) as their immune-
competent relatives. A large second section is
headed "new and combined immune defects" but is
something of a pot-pourri, without any obvious
review or rapporteur-type paper. A rather short but
interesting section treats the important practical
topic of disease in these animals. In the succeeding
section on tumorigenicity assays, the position paper
is a good critical overview, which points out that
failure of particular tumours to take remains not
uncommon, for reasons that are not understood.
Sections on metastatic potential and on therapy of
human tumour xenografts complete the volume. In
the latter section, one would like to have seen
rather more prominent discussion of the truisms
that although the parenchyma of these tumours is
undoubtedly human, the stroma is murine and the
pharmacokinetics of injected drugs likewise.
The book is up-to-date (1983 references) and
workers in a wide variety of subjects, who may be
considering using immune-deficient animals, will
almost certainly find a starting-point somewhere in
its 450 pages. It is very expensive but Dr Sordat
and the publishers have produced a well-edited,
high-quality book.

Purine Metabolism in Man-IV-Clinical and
Therapeutic Aspects; Regulatory Mechanisms.
(Advances in Experimental Medicine and
Biology/Vol. 165 A). (Eds. C.H.M.M. DE BRUYN,

Plenum Press, 555 pp. 1984, $75, ISBN

The two volumes Purine Metabolism in Man IV
contain papers presented at the IV International
Symposium on Purine and Pyrimidine metabolism
BOOK REVIEWS 573
in Man. Volume A covers Clinical and Therapeutic
Aspects: Regulatory Mechanisms and B,
Biochemical, Immunological and Cancer Research.
Obviously with such a wide scope the information
contained within these volumes is considerable.
Papers presented cover topics ranging from the
molecular analysis of Lesh Nyhan syndrome
(HGPRT deficiency) in man using cloned mouse
HGPRT sequences to probe DNA isolated from
Lesh Nyhan patients to adenine nucleotide
biosynthesis in cardiac muscle. Much attention is
also paid to the use of the ecto enzyme
5'nucleotidase as a marker for differentiation in
normal and leukaemic lymphocytes. It is surprising
in view of its extensive use as a marker that the
physiological role of this enzyme is still not
understood.
The titles of these books are misleading as they
include, as expected from the title of the
symposium, a considerable number of papers on
pyrimidine metabolism together with details of
several potential new anticancer agents which
inhibit specific steps in pyrimidine biosynthesis.
Most of the papers are short and easily readable
with detailed references making it easy to trace
background literature. It is a pity however that
titles are not included for all references and that
lettering on some of the figures is too small to be
easily readable. Overall however the books are well
produced and there is an adequate index. They
should provide a valuable reference source for
workers in many fields of medicine and
biochemistry..
