Benzene Toxicity and Risk Assessment,
1972-1992: Implications for Future Regulation
by Dennis J. Paustenbach, Rena D. Bass, and
Paul Price
Acute and chronic exposure to benzene vapors poses a number of health hazards to humans. To evaluate the
probability that a specific degree ofexposure will produce an adverse effect, risk assessment methods must be
used. This paper reviews much of the published information and evaluates the various risk assessments for
benzene that have been conducted over the past 20 years. There is sufficient evidence that chronic exposure to
relatively high concentrations ofbenzene can produce an increased incidence of acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML). Some studies have indicated that benzene may cause other leukemias, but due to the inconsistency of
results, the evidence is not conclusive. To predict the leukemogenic risk for humans exposed to much lower
doses of benzene than those observed in most epidemiology studies, a model must be used. Although several
models could yield plausible results, to date most risk assessments have used the linear-quadratic or
conditional logistic models. These appear to be the most appropriate ones for providing the cancer risk for
airborne concentrations of 1 ppb to 10 ppm, the range most often observed in the community and workplace. Of
the seven major epidemiology studies that have been conducted, there is a consensus that the Pliofilm cohort
(rubber workers) is the best one for estimating the cancer potency because it is the only one with good exposure
and incidence of disease data. The current EPA, OSHA, and ACGIH cancer potency estimates for benzene are
based largely on this cohort. A retrospective exposure assessment and an analysis ofthe incidence ofdisease in
these workers were completed in 1991. All of these issues are discussed and the implications evaluated in this
paper. The range ofbenzene exposures to which Americans are commonly exposed and the current regulatory
criteria are also presented.
Introduction
The health hazards of benzene have been the subject of
relatively widespread concern at three different times
during this century. During the 1920s, acute and chronic
toxicity among workers exposed to high levels was
reported by numerous researchers and clinicians (1-3).
During the 1970s, data indicated that benzene posed a
carcinogenic hazard to workers (4-7). In the 1980s, atten-
tion focused not only on exposure to petroleum and chemi-
cal workers but also on the concentrations to which the
public was exposed. In particular, benzene exposure via
indoor air, tobacco usage, and self-service gas stations
were of special interest (8,9). The presence of benzene in
gasoline and its production during combustion in automotive
engines will almost certainly be well studied in the 1990s.

Physical and Chemical Properties of
Benzene
Benzene is an aromatic hydrocarbon with the molecular
formula C6H6 and a molecular weight of 78.1 (10). Under
standard conditions, it is a colorless liquid with an aromatic
odor. Benzene is volatile (vapor pressure of 100 mm Hg at
26°C), has a Henry's law constant of 5.5 x 10-3 atm m3/
mole (11), and is highly flammable. The limits of flam-
mability in air are 1.5-8.0% by volume and flashpoint of
- 11.1°C. Benzene is relatively soluble in water (up to 1.8
g/L at 25°C) and is miscible with a variety of organic
solvents. Its density, 0.8737 g/mL at 25°C, is lower than
PAUSTENBACH ET AL.
that ofwater, so that undissolved benzene floats on top of
water. The pure liquid freezes at 5.553°C and boils at
80.10C (12).
Sources and Uses
Benzene occurs naturally in petroleum and is formed
during the combustion of biomass (13,14). Benzene,
derived from petroleum,], is a major industrial chemical.
According to Kiefer (15), approximately 1.6 billion gallons
ofbenzene were produced in the United States in 1990. The
major uses ofbenzene are as a component of gasoline and
as a feedstock for the manufacture of synthetic, organic
chemicals.
In the past, benzene was used extensively as a solvent
(2). In the late nineteenth century, benzene facilitated the
rapid development of the rubber industry because of its
ability to dissolve rubber and its ease of evaporation
during the manufacture of formed or coated rubber prod-
ucts. It played a similar role in the high-speed printing
processes. Many industries have used benzene as a solvent
or as a starting material for chemical .syntheses (16). Due
to toxicity concerns, benzene is infrequently used as an
industrial solvent (15).
Fate and Transport
The majority of benzene lost to the environment is as a
vapor (17). Benzene in the environment tends to partition
into the air (18). Once in the air, benzene is photodegraded
with a half-life ofapproximately 1 week (19). Because it is a
constituent of gasoline and is slightly soluble in water,
benzene has often been detected in groundwater as a
result ofleaking underground storage tanks. The environ-
mental half-life at low concentrations ofbenzene in soil and
groundwater under aerobic conditions is approximately 10
to 20 days (20). Under anaerobic conditions, benzene is
resistant to degradation and can be present for many
years (19).
Occurrence
Benzene is a ubiquitous airborne contaminant in both
rural and urban areas. Table 1 presents some concentra-
tions of benzene typically found in the United States.
Benzene in ambient urban air is primarily due to auto-
mobile use. Other sources of benzene such as industrial
releases play a relatively minor role in determining the
ambient levels but can influence airborne concentrations in
areas near a point source (19). For example, the ambient
concentration ofbenzene in the vicinity ofgas stations has
been reported to be approximately 0.005 to 0.008 ppm (23).
Levels as high as 0.1 ppm (21,22) have been reported.
Concentrations of benzene in the breathing zone of indi-
viduals pumping gas at self-service stations range from
about 0.1 to 1 ppm (21,23-26). Benzene has sometimes been
a groundwater and soil contaminant at hazardous and
municipal waste sites (27).

Toxicology of Benzene
Thewidespread use ofbenzene as a solvent for nearly 50
years has encouraged researchers to study its acute and
chronic effects on animals and humans. Numerous reviews
have discussed various aspects of benzene toxicology
(4,28-32). Various scientific bodies including the Interna-
tional Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) (13,33), the
National Academy of Sciences (NAS) (34), the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) (35), and the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (36,37) have
reviewed the literature published through 1977.
Acute Toxicity in Animals
A summary ofthe acute effects ofbenzene in animals is
presented in Table 2. As shown, the oral LD50 values in the
rat vary from 3.4 to 5.6 g/kg depending on the age and
strain (38). The LD50 values are reasonably consistent
among species (39). Benzene in the rabbit eye is amoderate
irritant and causes conjunctival irritation and slight, tran-
sient corneal injury (40). The LC50 ranges from 10,000
ppm in mice and rats to 53,300 ppm in cats. Adult rats and
mice are often more resistant to the effects of benzene
than are young animals (41).
Acute Toxicity in Humans
Humans have demonstrated a relatively high tolerance
for acute exposure to benzene. That is, persons can be
exposed to concentrations of benzene up to 1000 ppm for
periods up to 1 hrwithout apparent serious adverse effects
(42). Early in the century, this characteristic encouraged
the use of benzene as a commercial solvent. The primary
acute responses to benzene involve adverse effects on the
central nervous system (CNS), including dizziness, giddi-
ness, exhilaration, nausea, vomiting, headache, drowsi-
ness, staggering, loss of balance, narcosis, coma, and
death (30,40). Individual case reports of acute benzene
intoxication have appeared in the literature since the early
1900s (1-3,43-46). Table 3 presents a summary of pub-
lished case reports of toxicity associated with various
airborne concentrations of benzene (47). These reports
indicate that concentrations ofbenzene up to 1000 ppm are
tolerable for short periods and that concentrations
between 500 and 1000 ppm are not self-limiting ifworkers
are acclimated to the odor. Moreover, for those workers
particularly resistant to its hematopoietic effects, airborne
concentrations ofbenzene in the range of200-250 ppm (8-
hr time-weighted average) may not always cause obvious
acute or subchronic toxicity. These characteristics help
explain why so many workers developed significant blood
dyscrasias and other adverse effects before 1960.

Chronic Toxicity in Animals
An increased incidence of neoplasms has been found in
rats and mice exposed to high concentrations of benzene
by inhalation or ingestion (48-53). The sites with elevated
tumor rates include the zymbal gland, oral cavity, prepu-
tial gland, lung, and ovaries. Tbmors of the zymbal gland
are the most consistent tumor type reported in rodent
bioassays (48,50,54,55). In some studies with mice, tumors
ofthe hematopoietic system were found but only in female
mice after inhalation exposure (49,56) and only in male
mice after oral dosing (55). The reasons for the differences
in response between species is not known; however, inter-
species differences in metabolism and pharmacokinetics of
benzene via different routes of exposure may be partly
responsible (30,32,57). Thus far, no animal species tested
has clearly been demonstrated to develop the same types
of chronic adverse effects as those seen in humans (acute
myelogenous leukemia) (52).
Chronic Toxicity in Humans
Chronic occupational exposure to benzene has been
known to cause hematological effects since the nineteenth
century. Santesson (58) described cases of benzene tox-
icity in workers fabricating bicycle tires in the late 1800s.
Many cases of benzene toxicity were reported near the
turn of the century, and Alice Hamilton warned in her
landmark paper, "The Growing Menace of Benzene (ben-
zol) Poisoning in American Industry," (2) that a serious
problem was at hand. She suggested that many workers
could die due to benzene-induced anemia ifexposures were
not better controlled.
Excessive exposure to benzene results in suppression of
the production of both red and white blood cells, i.e.,
pancytopenia (59). More severe cases, which are generally
associated with a marked decrease in the number of cells
in the bone marrow, are classified as aplastic anemia. One
important point is that these are not distinct diseases but
rather a continuum of changes reflecting the severity of
bone marrow damage. Among the studies that have dem-
onstrated this wide range of hematological responses due
to benzene toxicity are those of Goldwater and his col-
leagues (60-62), as well as many others (36,63-76).
Earlywork by Greenburg (1) showed that many persons
chronically exposed to benzene can tolerate concentrations
ofabout 100 to 250 ppm for 8 hr/dayformanyyears. Table 4
presents some ofthe results ofhis studies. The concentra-
tions in the work areas he studied in which benzene was
the only solvent present ranged from 0 to more than 4000
ppm. It is not known whether the values represent time-
weighted averages, although he stated that the concentra-
tions given are "representative of general room air and/or
air at a worker's station" (1). Hematotoxicity, defined as a
25% decrease in leukocyte count (1), was the most consis-
tent adverse effect observed and was usually related to the
concentrations of benzene vapor. In the 1930s-1950s,
because air sampling methods were rather insensitive and
dermal exposure was often significant, red and white
blood counts were monitored as a means of managing the
employee risk due benzene to exposure (47,77,78). In
retrospect, the reliance on biological monitoring rather
than air sampling probably saved many lives because it
inherently accounted for differences in individual suscep-
tibility and dermal uptake. Despite a fairly broad aware-
ness ofbenzene toxicity, Elkins (79) found that exposure to
concentrations ranging from 200 to 700 ppm over several
years sometimes occurred, and these resulted in some
fatalities (cause ofdeath not stated) in the leather process-
ing industry during the 1940s.
Leukemia. The thought that exposure to benzene might
produce certain leukemias and especially acute myelogen-
ous leukemia (AML) was put forward in the 1950s, but
clear evidence was lackinguntil the 1970s. AML is a cancer
in which there is an abnormal proliferation of the myeloid
stem cells, which are believed to be the common progenitor
for mature circulating blood cells (i.e., erythrocytes,
thrombocytes, and leukocytes) (54). This disease is mostly
observed in adults and has an increasing incidence with
age, peaking in the sixth or seventh decade (80). There
have been more than 10 studies of 5 cohorts that have
shown an association between AML or its variants and
benzene exposure (70,81-85). Particularly meaningful is
the finding by several researchers of the progression of
aplastic anemia in a benzene-exposed individual through a
preleukemic phase into frank acute leukemia (46,70,86,87).
Chronic studies of benzene in animals have confirmed
its hematotoxicity (28,88,89). Although numerous cases of
leukemia have been attributed to benzene exposure, there
has been a reluctance by some researchers to identify
benzene as the causative factor because no animal model
for benzene-induced leukemia has been well established.
In addition, it is plausible that benzene produces this effect
only when other predisposing factors are present.
Aflatoxin is an example of a chemical that appears to be
carcinogenic in only a subset of the general population;
that is, cancer is seen almost exclusively in those persons
who have been chemically exposed to aflatoxin and have
had hepatitis (90).
Other Effects. Benzene has been shown to be embryo/
fetotoxic in animals, as evidenced by increased incidences
of resorptions, reduced fetal weights, skeletal variations,
and altered fetal hematopoiesis (91,92). Because these
effects only occurred after relatively high doses, benzene
has not been generally considered a significant develop-
mental hazard to humans. There is insufficient evidence to
indicate thatbenzene is teratogenic or overtly embryotoxic
in animals or humans atvapor concentrations of10 ppm for
8 hr/day (93).
There are no data to suggest that benzene produces a
developmental hazard to humans at most workplace or
environmental concentrations. Although some epi-
demiological studies have implicated benzene as a develop-
mental toxicant in humans, their limitations are too great
to be conclusive (19). The confounding variables include
exposure to multiple substances, lack of incidences in
control populations for the end points ofinterest, problems
in identifying the exposed populations, and lack of data on
the degree of exposure.

Benzene Metabolism and
Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetics ofbenzene have been well studied
in animals. The elimination rate via exhalation has been
studied in dogs (94), rabbits (95), mice (96), and rats (97).
Schrenk et al. (94) exposed dogs to 800 ppm benzene by
inhalation. It was determined that the degree of elimina-
tion and the concentration in exhaled air was related to the
duration ofexposure because ofthe tendency ofbenzene to
accumulate in body fat. Parke and Williams (95) admin-
istered [14C]-benzene orally to rabbits and mice and
recovered approximately 43% of the administered dose as
unmetabolized benzene in trapped, exhaled air. Andrews
et al. (96) administered benzene to mice subcutaneously
and recovered 72% of the dose in the air. Simultaneous
treatment with both benzene and toluene (96,98) or ben-
zene and piperonal butoxide (99) increased the excretion of
unchanged benzene in the breath. Co-administration of
these chemicals is believed to inhibit benzene metabolism,
leaving more unchanged benzene available for excretion
through the lungs.
Benzene is eliminated via excretion of its metabolites in
the urine of experimental animals and only a small amount
is excreted in feces. Exhalation is the major route of
excretion of unmetabolized benzene (13). A biphasic pat-
tern of elimination occurs in rats exposed to 500 ppm for 6
hr, with half-times for expiration of0.7 and 13.1 hr (97). The
initial half-life (t,12) of 0.7 hr was similar for blood, bone
marrow, and other organs; the half-life in fat was 1.6 hr
(97). Such compartmental analyses are significantly less
useful now that physiologically based pharmacokinetic
models for benzene have been developed.
The pharmacokinetics ofbenzene have also been studied
in humans (98,100-104). Benzene absorbed by any route is
eliminated by exhalation of unmetabolized benzene from
the lungs and bymetabolism ofbenzene in the liver and, to
a lesser extent, by the bone marrow. Metabolites of ben-
zene are excreted in the urine. The fraction of benzene
metabolized depends on the route ofexposure and the size
ofthe dose. The fraction ofbenzene excreted in the expired
air ranges between 12 and 50% (100,101,105). The respira-
tory elimination in humans was reported to be triphasic
(101). The initial compartment has a half-life of about 1 hr,
similar to the value determined in rats (97). The second,
slower phase has a half-life of3 hr, and the third has a half-
life of > 15 hr. No differences in respiratory elimination
were observed between men and women (Table 5). Gordon
et al. (106) has reported a biphasic elimination rate where,
as expected, the second phase was proportional to the
long-term body burden of benzene.
Metabolism
The metabolism ofbenzene has been extensively studied
in animals and humans (107,108). The major pathways of
benzene metabolism have probably been identified (Fig. 1).
Benzene is metabolized to a number of chemicals that are

excreted in conjugated and nonconjugated forms. Metabo-
lism occurs primarily in the liver, but in other organs as
well, including the bone marrow. Irons et al. (109) have
described the metabolism of benzene in rat bone marrow
that was perfused in vitro. In these studies, benzene
metabolites accumulated in the marrowmuch as they do in
vivo. The rate of benzene metabolism in marrow is much
lower than in the liver and is likely related to the low level
of mixed-function oxidase activity in bone marrow. In the
liver (89), benzene may be converted via a cytochrome
P450-mediated pathway (110) to benzene oxide, which can
be transformed by epoxide hydratase to the 1,2-
dihydrodiol. This step leads to catechol formation (111).
Benzene oxide can also rearrange nonenzymatically to
phenol, which is metabolized to hydroquinone (112). There
is also evidence that the major hydroxylated metabolites of
benzene can be formed by direct hydroxylation involving
free radical insertion (113). Quantitatively, the major meta-
bolic product of benzene is phenol. There are a large
number of metabolites that are formed including
glucuronidated and sulfated products. The net effect ofthe
metabolism of benzene is that the nonpolar benzene mole-
cule becomes water soluble and excretable in the urine (59).
The rate of metabolism of benzene in animals and
humans is similar (allometrically scaled) and produces
many of the same metabolites. However, significant dif-
ferences in benzene metabolism among some species have
been reported. For example, Sabourin et al. (114) and
Medinsky et al. (57) have reported significant differences
between benzene metabolism in rats and mice. While rats
metabolized more benzene (orally administered) on a
weight basis than mice, mice tended to form greater
amounts of hydroquinone and benzoquinone (107,114).
Brodfuehrer et al. (115) has also shown that while metabo-
lism of '4C-labeled benzene by liver slices and microsomal
preparation occurred at similar rates in tissues from
mouse, rat, and man, covalent binding of 14C-relative
metabolites to microsomal protein differed significantly
with man > mouse > rat.
The metabolism of benzene is also dose dependent.
Medinsky et al. (57) and Sabourin et al. (116) reported that
metabolism in humans was likely to be dominated by the
hydroquinone pathway for long-term exposures to con-
centrations below 10 ppm and by phenyl conjugates at
concentrations greater than 10 ppm.
The metabolism of benzene is also affected by co-
exposure to other aromatic compounds. Purcell et al. (117)
has demonstrated that co-exposures of benzene and
toluene result in a noncompetitive inhibition of both com-
pounds' metabolism in rats. This competition explains the
observation that co-exposure to toluene protects against
the hematopoietic effects of benzene in animals (118,119),
and reduces the amount ofbenzene metabolized in humans
(120). This finding suggests that when estimating the
human risk of exposure to benzene in petroleum products
that contain both chemicals, the approach should attempt

to account for the possible effects ofcoadministration with
toluene and possibly other substances.
Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic
Models
In the last decade, our understanding of the role of
metabolism in the prediction oftoxicity has been improved
by the development of mathematical models that quan-
titatively describe the uptake, metabolism, target organ
concentration, and elimination ofchemicals in animals and
humans (121-123). Such physiologically based phar-
macokinetic models (PBPK) models are useful in under-
standing the effect of route of administration on intemal
doses, extrapolation between species, and for providing a
basis for predicting the amount of the toxic metabolites
formed and their concentration at the target organ.
Travis et al. (124) have successfully described the phar-
macokinetics ofbenzene in rats, mice, and humans using a
PBPK model. Their model is based on five tissue groups,
including the liver (principal metabolic organ), fat, bone
marrow, moderately perfused organs (e.g., brain, heart,
kidney, and viscera) and the muscle. The bone marrowwas
added as a tissue compartment because it is almost cer-
tainly the target organ for benzene's toxic effects, and
because it is a potential site ofmetabolism. In their model,
benzene was assumed to be eliminated only by exhalation,
through Michaelis-Menten metabolism in the liver and, to
a lesser extent, in the bone marrow. Metabolic products of
benzenewere not included in the model. Model results have
been successfully fitted to empirical data on inhalation,
gavage, and intraperitoneal and subcutaneous injection in
mice, rats, and humans. The model by Tlavis et al. has been
used to study benzene binding to blood proteins (125), to
evaluate benzene elimination data from breath monitoring
in humans (103), to determine the influence of soil on the
absorption of benzene from the GI tract (126), and to
evaluate the metabolism of benzene when coadministered
with toluene (117).
Medinsky et al. (57) and Bois et al. (127) have separately
developed PBPK models for benzene and its major metab-
olites. Medinsky et al. used published values ofphysiologi-
cal parameters and developed kinetic data by fitting the
model to data from studies in laboratory animals (27,114).
The model accounted for phenol, hydroquinone, benzo-
quinone, muconaldehyde, and other metabolites. These
models have been used to investigate the differences in
carcinogenic end points between species and the relation-
ship between route of metabolism and the administered
dose.
The Bois et al. (127) model is based on the same com-
partments and metabolites but differs from the Medinsky
et al. (57) model by using a range of values rather than a
single value for the physiological parameters and kinetic
rate constants. The values for those model parameters are
determined by using a Monte-Carlo technique to fit data
from animal studies (127,128). Spear et al. (129) used these
models to fit experimental data from three benzene animal
studies using inhalation (97,116) and gavage (116) to a five-
compartment model. They concluded that the model did
not adequately represent experimental outcomes of the
three studies and that, in general, parameterization of
PBPK models to obtain fits to experimental data is com-
plex and problematic (129). The Bois et al. model has also
been used to interpret the results of the benzene and
phenol National Cancer Institute (NCI) bioassays (130)
and the relative significance of short-term exposures to
benzene (131).
Hazard Identification
Disease End Points
Occupational exposure to benzene as a solvent and as a
component ofpetroleum products has been reported to be
associated with a number of different types of cancer
including leukemias, lung cancer, and Hodgkin's disease
(Table 6).
The cancers most clearly associated with workplace
exposure to benzene are the leukemias. Leukemias are a
heterogeneous group ofneoplasms arising from the malig-
nant transformation of hematopoietic cells. Although sev-
eral agencies have concluded that benzene exposure can
increase the incidence of all forms of leukemia (13,132-
134), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and related leu-
kemias (collectively referred to as acute nonlymphocytic
leukemias) are the primary leukemias associated with
benzene exposure. Lamm (135) and Wong (85) have indi-
cated that AML and its variants are the only cancers
consistently associated with exposure to benzene.
While AML may have the strongest association with
benzene exposure, other cancers of the hematopoietic
system, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and
multiple myeloma (MM) have also been associated with
benzene exposure (37,81,136). Both MM and CML occur

when there is a proliferation ofcells from the same myeloid
stem cells as AML. This suggests that all three types of
leukemia could be caused by changes in the initially com-
mitted myeloid stem cell. Goldstein (59) has noted that the
evidence for the association between the benzene and MM
and CML is not yet conclusive. Rinsky et al. (137) sug-
gested that MM's association with benzene exposure may
be hidden by the longer latency period for the disease.
However, the failure of the most recent update (138) to
identify additional cases of MM in the Pliofilm cohort
makes this hypothesis less tenable.
Latency
There are numerous case reports oflong delays between
the cessation of known benzene exposure and the onset of
acute leukemia (70,138-144). AML has been reported to
occur as long as 20-30 years after the last exposure to
benzene (138).
Development of quantitative estimates of latency is a
necessary aspect of low-dose extrapolation of epidemiol-
ogy data. Heretofore, most estimates of latency for ben-
zene have been based on radiation-induced leukemias
(145,146). The length ofthe latency has varied from assess-
ment to assessment, but the best information on latency
for benzene is probably found in the Pliofilm cohort
(147,205).
Genotoxicity
Benzene has tested negative for mutagenic potential;
however, positive results in Salmonella typhimurium
have been reported in the presence ofexogenous metabolic
activation (148,149,173). Metabolites of benzene have also
been identified as mutagenic (150).
There are conflicting data on the ability of benzene to
form adducts with DNA. Snyder et al. (108) reported DNA
adducts in bone marrow using a 32P-postlabeling assay
after repeated, high oral doses (1 mL/kg), while Reddy et
al. (151) was unable to find benzene-induced DNA adducts
using similar methodology. Subramangan et al. (152)
reported that bone marrow is capable of metabolizing
phenol to polymeric products which can bind tightly to
DNA. These findings suggest that positive results of the
radiolabeled binding studies could be due to incomplete
purification ofDNA. Finally, two benzene metabolites have
been reported to form DNA adducts after in vivo admin-
istration (153).
Benzene has been reported positive for various tests for
clastogenicity after relatively high (in vivo) doses. Oral
administration of 220-880 mg/kg benzene in mice caused
micronuclei formation (154,155). In mice, exposure to 3100
ppm benzene for 4 hr caused increases in sister chromatid
exchanges (SCE) and chromosomal aberrations (156).
Erexson et al. (150) has reported slight but statistically
significant increases in SCEs and micronuclei in mice
after a single 6-hr exposure to benzene at concentrations
as low as 10 ppm. The same investigators reported similar
small increases in micronuclei in rats after exposure to 1
ppm. Au et al. (157) reported the induction ofchromosomal
aberrations in spleen lymphocytes of mice exposed for 6
weeks to 2 > 40 ppb benzene. The data from the two
experiments reported in this study do not agree, and the
more reliable experiment (as judged by the authors) does
not show a dose response over a 25-fold dose range. The
animal data indicate that benzene can cause dose-
dependent clastogenesis in cells ofhematopoietic origin in
rodents at concentrations as lowas 1 ppm. The relationship
between this clastogenic response and leukemogenesis in
these species is unclear because benzene does not produce
leukemia in either rodent species.
The incidence of clastogenic effects in humans exposed
to benzene in the workplace has been examined by several
investigators. Chromosomal aberrations (CAs) or
aneuploid cells have been found in circulating lymphocytes
of workers who exhibited signs of hematotoxicity
(75,144,158,159). Clear evidence for clastogenicity in
humans exposed to low levels of benzene is not available.
Picciano (160) reported increased chromosomal aberra-
tions in workers believed to be exposed to 2-10 ppm
benzene for several years. However, a group of female
workers exposed to up to 40 ppm for up to 20 years did not
exhibit any increases in CAs or SCEs even in a subgroup
that had decreased blood counts at the time of testing
(161). Two other studies of refinery workers and shoe-
makers (162-164) found no increases in SCEs in workers
with exposures up to 100 ppm.
Although these studies are difficult to interpret due to
possible confounding factors such as smoking, inadequate
exposure information, and lack of a dose-response rela-
tionship, itis reasonable to conclude thatbenzene exposure
at levels sufficient to cause hematotoxicity may produce
clastogenic effects in human lymphocytes. The likelihood
that these effects can occur at current occupational expo-
sure levels has not been established. The relevance of
clastogenic effects to human leukemia is unclear, although
such effects are relevant to one of several hypothesized
mechanisms for benzene leukemogenesis discussed later.
Mechanisms of Action
Many studies indicate that benzene mustbe metabolized
to produce its major toxic effects (31,89,165-168). However,
the mechanism for benzene toxicity remains unclear. In
addition, the mechanisms that produce chronic hema-
topoietic effects, clastogenic effects, and leukemia are not
necessarily the same (169). Also, uncertainties remain
regarding which metabolite(s) is (are) responsible for
specific toxic effects, and it appears there may be complex
interactions between metabolites contributing to the in
vivo and in vitro toxicity (170).
The search for a mechanism for benzene leuke-
mogenesis is greatly hampered by the absence of an
animal model for benzene-induced leukemia. Unlike most
other human carcinogens, where the evidence for an asso-
ciation between the chemical and cancer has been con-
firmed in animal studies, no good animal model for
benzene leukemogenesis has been identified. Cronkite et
al. (56) reported that benzene could induce myelogenous
leukemia in the CBA/ca mouse; however, these results
require additional confirmatory studies.
184
RISK ASSESSMENT FOR BENZENE
In the absence of an animal model, plausible mecha-
nisms for benzene's leukemogenic and other carcinogenic
effects have been suggested based on indirect evidence
such as the reaction of specific benzene metabolites with
DNA and animal models of the hematopoietic effects of
benzene metabolites. Perhaps the most widely proposed
mechanism is that benzene metabolites initiate cancer by
direct reaction with cellular DNA, creating DNA adducts
that represent heritable damage to the somatic cell line.
The trans, trans-muconaldehyde (171), p-benzoquinone
(31), or even the reaction product of p-benzoquinone and
glutathione (172) could be the causative agent. As dis-
cussed earlier, the evidence for significant formation of
DNA adducts after in vivo administration of benzene is
equivocal. Cytogenetic effects of benzene resulting in
chromosomal damage may also play an important role in
the mechanism of benzene toxicity and leukemogeneses
(174,175).
Amajorproblemwith the proposed DNAadduct mecha-
nism is the failure of phenol to induce cancer in rodents.
The NCI bioassay ofphenol is negative (176), yet phenol is
the metabolite through which many of the suggested
binding metabolites, such as hydroquinone and p-benzo-
quinone, are formed. Bois et al. (130) concluded that the
negative phenol bioassay cannot be explained on the basis
of a first-pass effect as suggested by Casidy and Houston
(177,178).
An alternative hypothesis ofbenzene leukemogenesis is
that the by-products ofmetabolism ofbenzene rather than
the initial metabolites themselves are responsible for the
observed toxicity. This hypothesis is based on observa-
tions that benzene is metabolized by the cytochrome
P-450TTE1 (179,180) and that further metabolism ofben-
zene metabolites can involve a variety ofperoxidases (181).
These enzymes can produce a variety offree radicals and
activated oxygen species that may contribute to benzene
toxicity (182). This hypothesis, as well as the literature on
the oxidative metabolism ofbenzene, has been reviewed by
Subrahmanyan et al. (183). It is possible that both direct
and indirect mechanisms may be responsible for the
myleotoxicity and leukemogenesis of benzene. Cox (170)
has discussed these and several other proposed mecha-
nisms in a recent paper (Thble 7).
The mechanism of benzene's hematotoxicity has been
investigated in animal models by a number of authors.
Benzene metabolism has been shown to be necessary to
produce hematotoxicity. Benzene's erythropoietic effects,
as measured byinhibition of59Fe uptake, is apparentlythe
result of a number of metabolites, and the interaction of
the metabolites has been shown to be signiflcant (88,108).
In vivo measurements of benzene hematotoxicity have
been demonstrated to be a function of the toxicity of
benzene's metabolites on dividing cells (184) and have been
duplicated by the co-administration ofthe benzene metab-
olites of hydroquinone and phenol (185).
Bone marrow toxicity has been shown to depend greatly
on the timing of the exposure. When phenol and quinol
were coadministered to mice by a "continuous" dosing
regimen, bone marrow cellularity decreased initially, with
gradual recovery beginning at the second week despite
lable 7. Possible mechanisms for the
leukemogenisis of benzene (170).
Hypothesis 1
Benzene metabolites such as trans, trans-muconic acid or
p-benzoquinone initiate cancer by reacting with cellular DNA,
creating DNA adducts that represent hertiable, carcinogenic
damage to the somatic cell line. The resulting mutated cells fail to
respond normally to regulatory signals instructing them to
differentiate instead of proliferating. This hypothesis is the most
common in the literature.
Hypothesis 2
The compensating proliferation of stem cells created by cytotoxic
effects of benzene metabolites on partially differentiated cells
increases the likelihood of carcinogenic damage, assuming that stem
cells are at greater risk of carcinogenic damage while they are
actively proliferating than while they are in their normal, quiescent
state.
Hypothesis 3
Cytotoxic damage to the stromal microenvironment, including
stromal macrophages, impairs its ability to regulate stem cell
proliferation and differentiation. Initiated and/or malignant stem
cells are allowed to proliferate uncontrollably, whereas normally
their division would be suppressed or they might be stimulated to
differentiate into harmless lineages. Thus, according to this theory,
leukemia is expressed as a result of failure by the stromal
microenvironment to produce normal regulatory signals telling stem
cells to differentiate instead of proliferate.
Hypothesis 4
Cytotoxic damage to the immune system, including lymphocytes and
stromal macrophages, allows tumor cells that would normally be
detected and killed to survive and proliferate instead, leading to a
variety of carcinogenic end points.
Hypothesis 5
Benzene metabolites initiate cancer through their effects on stem
cell chromosomes. Chromosomal aberrations induced by
hydroquinone or p-benzoquinone, for example, may activate
oncogenes (by carrying them to an active site as a result of a
deletion or translocation) or inactive anti-oncogenes.
continued treatment (155). When the mice were treated by
a "discontinuous" regimen, however, bone marrow cel-
lularity decreased profoundly, with no evidence of recov-
ery during the treatment period. This apparent paradox,
in which the lower total dose administered in the discon-
tinuous protocol was more toxic than the higher dose ofthe
continuous regimen, supports the view that the toxic
effects ofbenzene metabolites on the marrow are cell-cycle
dependent. Supportive evidence for the importance of
timing on benzene toxicity is also provided by the studies
of Luke et al. (186,187), who found that a 3-day exposure
regimen produced more micronucleated polychromatic
erythrocytes than did 5 days of exposure.
Benzene has been shown to activate protein kinase C, an
enzyme playing a pivotal role in signal transduction, which
is involved in cell transformation and tumor promotion
(188). A series of studies has shown that benzene affects
the function of the cellular and hormonal regulators of
blood formation, in particular, the function of the stromal
cell (168,189). These effects appear to be due to a selective
suppression of interleukin 1 (IL-1) released by mac-
rophages, which, in the case of the benzene-associated
suppression ofpre-B lymphocytes, results in a reduction of
IL-1-dependent release ofL-4 bymarrow fibroblasts (190).

PAUSTENBACH ET AL.
Epidemiology
The epidemiology of benzene is best defined by five
cohorts. Table 8 presents a summary of their relative
strengths and weaknesses. These studies all showed an
increase in leukemia in the exposed population, however,
most of the studies lack accurate estimates of exposure
and were confounded because persons were exposed to
several chemicals in addition to benzene.
Shoe Workers Study
Aksoy (6) conducted a case study of 34 shoe workers
who were admitted to the hematology department of
Istanbul Medical School with a diagnosis of leukemia
between 1967 and 1975. The total number of shoe workers
in Istanbul was estimated to be 28,500. Aksoy used data on
the leukemia mortality in the general population of West-
ern nations as his control population. He later indicated
that the leukemia incidence rate of2.5 to 3/100,000 for the
general population of Turkey, which would normally be
considered the appropriate control group, was not used in
the analysis because vital statistics in Turkey could not by
relied upon to draw scientific conclusions. The greatest
shortcoming in this study is the very poor knowledge
about the degree of exposure to benzene and other chemi-
cals. For example, it must be assumed that workers were
exposed to a number of different chemicals, including a
mixture-ofvolatile hydrocarbons, curing agents, and dyes.
The author indicated that the concentration of benzene
vapor ranged between 15 and 30 ppm outside working
hours and between 150 and 210 ppm during working hours,
with maximum concentrations reaching 210-650 ppm
when adhesives containing benzene were used.
Chemical Workers
Wong (191) conducted a prospective mortality study of a
group of 4602 male chemical workers from seven plants
who were occupationally exposed to benzene for at least 6
months between 1946 and 1976. They were compared to a
group of3074 male chemical workers from the same plants
who had no occupational exposure to benzene. The relative
risk of leukemia could not be determined in the exposed
group compared to the unexposed group because no deaths
from leukemia were observed in the internal control popu-
lation. It should be noted that none ofthe leukemia deaths
in the exposed exhortwere ofthe acute myelogenous type,
the cancer that has been most commonly associated with
benzene exposure in other occupational studies.
Dow Studies
Ott et al. (192) studied the mortality of 594 white males
who were exposed to benzene in three production areas of
the Dow Chemical Company in Michigan. Benzene con-
centrations in the chlorobenzene, alkylbenzene, and ethyl
cellulose areas were based upon industrial hygiene
monitoring data. Benzene concentrations ranged from 0 to
937 ppm, although the estimated time-weighted average
(TWA) benzene concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 35.5
ppm in the various job categories. A total of three cases
classified as leukemia was observed from 1940 to 1973
versus 0.8 expected (based upon incidence data from the
Third National Cancer Survey).
Bond et al. (83) conducted a 9-yearfollow-up ofthe Ott et
al. (192) study and evaluated some additional workers. In
their analysis, 956 Dow Michigan division employees
potentially exposed to benzene were studied. Four leuke-
mia deaths were observed versus 2.1 expected (based upon
U.S. white male mortality rates), and this increase was not
statistically significant. However, all four leukemias were
of the myelogenous type. When the mortality for
myelogenous leukemia was compared with that which
would be expected based upon National Cancer Institute
Surveillance Epidemiology End Results (SEER) data, a
statistically significant excess was observed (4 observed
versus 0.9 expected; p = 0.011). Recently, Bond (193) noted
that a fifth leukemia case occurred in an individual whose
death certificate was classified to pneumonia in the Ott et
al. study, and this subject also had AML. This study has
been considered less-than-optional for understanding ben-
zene carcinogenicity because exposure to many other
chemicals occurred. However, it may be useful for defining
the upper bound of the possible risk.
Chinese Worker Study
Yin et al. (84) carried out a retrospective cohort study in
1982-83 among 28,460 benzene-exposed workers from 233
factories and 28,257 controlworkers from 83 factories in 12
large cities in China. All-cause mortality was significantly
higher among the exposed (265/100,000 person-years)
than for the controls. The standardized mortality ratios

(SMR) were evaluated for leukemia (SMR = 5.74), lung
cancer (SMR = 2.31), primary hepatocarcinoma (SMR =
1.12), and stomach cancer (SMR = 1.22). Leukemia was
evaluated for females only. Leukemia occurred among
some workers with as little as 6 to 10 ppm average expo-
sure and 50 ppm-years cumulative lifetime exposure.
Among the 30 leukemia cases identified in the exposed
cohort, the proportion of subjects with acute lymphocytic
leukemia was substantially lower and the proportion with
acute nonlymphocytic leukemia was higher than the gen-
eral population. The major shortcoming ofthis studyis the
lack ofreliable exposure data, adequacy ofthe nosological
methods, and the virtual certainty that exposure to other
chemicals occurred.
Ohio Pliofilm Study
Infante et al. (7) and Rinsky et al. (81,136,137) have
examined the leukemia mortality experience of a group of
workers who were exposed to benzene in the manufactur-
ing ofrubber hydrochloride (Pliofilm) at three facilities in
two cities in Ohio between 1934 and 1974. This cohort may
be the most intensely and carefully studied group in the
history of occupational epidemiology (7,47,77,78,81,135-
137,194-197). This group, originally described by Infante
et al. (7), contains approximately 1800 white male workers
who had been employed in the manufacture of rubber
hydrochloride for at least 1 day between 1940 and 1975. In
this cohort, nine cases of leukemia (AML) and four multi-
ple myeloma cases were observed by Rinsky et al. (136).
Follow-up studies of the cohort have identified five addi-
tional cases of leukemia (138).
Plioflim Cohort. Since this cohort is the one most often
used to estimate potency, it is important to understand its
strengths and weaknesses. While other cohorts have
larger numbers ofworkers or have reported more cases of
leukemia, no other cohort contains such good information
on the duties and exposure histories ofthe workers, nor the
quality of medical surveillance. In addition, exposure to
other compounds is much less of a problem in this cohort
than in others. Detailed individual job histories are avail-
able on all workers, and the manufacturing process
remained largely unchanged over the 40 years. Relatively
large amounts ofair sampling data are available to charac-
terize exposure levels for several time periods.
Estimates ofExposure. While the information on the
exposure ofthe rubberworkers is generally far superior to
other epidemiology studies, there are significant short-
comings. Most of the exposure of the Pliofilm workers
apparently occurred during the 1940s, when minimal
industrial hygiene data were collected. In addition, ben-
zene exposure for specific individuals is limited to the time
they spent in Pliofilm production. The work forces at the
two plants differed in their potential for exposure to
benzene and other chemicals while performing non-
Pliofilm tasks. The two Akron plants were part of a large
industrial tire-building complex, and the St. Mary's plant
was in a small town in western Ohio.
Overthe past 9 years, three different methods have been
used to estimate the likely retrospective exposure ofthese
workers. In the first method, Rinsky et al. (136) assumed
that for a givenjob, worker exposure was constant over the
40 years of operation unless specific data indicated other-
wise. Thus, for instance, workplace concentrations ofben-
zene in 1945 were assumed to be the same as in 1966. In the
second method, Crump and Allen (197) proposed an alter-
native analysis ofthe industrial hygiene data as described
in a report for the Occupational Safety and Health Admin-
istration (OSHA). They developed both an estimate of
cumulative exposure and peak exposure for each of the
employees. To estimate exposure for jobs during time
periods for which no data existed, they used all data for a
particular job to calculate a percentage of the threshold
limit valve (TLV) for that time and then applied that
percentage to earlier periods when no data were available.
Thus, if the data in the 1960s indicated that the average
exposure to benzene in a particular department was 15
ppm or 60% of the prevailing TLV of 25 ppm, then the
benzene concentration in that same department in 1945
was assumed to have the same relationship to the prevail-
ing TLV for 1960 (100 ppm) or 60 ppm. In short, they
assumed that the workplace concentration during those
time periods (relative to the TLV) would be similar to those
periods when it was not measured. Thble 9 shows how the
benzene TLV changed during the years of Pliofilm man-
ufacture. Since the Crump andAllen methods were related
to the TLV, their estimates of worker exposure for the
early years were much greater than those of Rinsky et al.
(136).
Paustenbach et al. (47) conducted the third retro-
spective exposure assessment of these workers. Their
estimates attempted to quantitatively account for a)
uptake due to short-term, high-level exposure to vapors, b)
uptake due to background concentrations in the manufac-
turing facility, c) absorption through the skin, d) morbidity
and mortality data on workers in the Pliofilm process, e)
the installation ofindustrial hygiene engineering controls,
f) extraordinarily longworkweeks during the 1940s, andg)
data indicating that airborne concentrations of benzene
were underestimated due to inaccurate monitoring devices
and the lack of adequate field calibration of these devices.
The Paustenbach et al. (47) analysis suggested that
Crump and Allen (197) overestimated the exposure of
workers in some job classifications and underestimated

them for others, and that Rinsky et al. (81,137) almost
certainly underestimated the exposure of nearly all
workers. Their analysis concluded thatworker exposure at
the St. Mary facility was 2- to 3-fold lower (on average)
than at the two Akron facilities. In addition, short-term,
high-level exposure to benzene vapors and dermal expo-
sure was found to make a significant contribution (about
30%) to the total absorbed dose. One ofthe key findings of
Paustenbach et al. was that the three facilities probably
had significantly different airborne concentrations ofben-
zene; especially during the 1940s and 1950s. Figure 2
graphically compares the results of the three exposure
estimation methods for three different job categories at
the two different manufacturing locations.
The Paustenbach et al. (47) estimates indicate that the
highest exposures to benzene occurred during the 1940s in
the Akron I plant. Before the 1940s, the shorter work week
and lower production volume probably kept the doses
relatively low. After the 1940s, the improved engineering
controls at the St. Mary's and Akron II plants and the
increasing concerns about the toxicity of benzene (as
reflected in the decreasing TLVs) apparently brought
about reductions in the workplace concentrations. During
this period, St. Maryworkers had greatlyreduced levels of
exposure due to a reduction in Pliofilm production at
that site.
Paustenbach et al. (47) acknowledged that because
there were virtually no measurements taken during the
1940s, there is significant uncertainty in their estimates.
However, they were confident that their estimates are
more likely to be accurate than prior estimates for several
reasons. First, they found and used new information not
considered by the earlier investigators. Second, based on
what is known about the incidence ofleukemia at the three
plants (based on the cumulative doses), the correlation of
disease with the dose predicted by Paustenbach et al. was
better than using either the Crump and Allen or the
Rinsky et al. methods (Table 10). Finally, Paustenbach et
al. take issue with the claim (199) that data on which the
revised estimates were based had been fully analyzed
during the earlier OSHA hearing on establishing a per-
missible exposure limit (PEL). Several key findings in
Paustenbach et al. were in fact not identified in the OSHA
regulatory action. Among these are the St. Mary's shut-
down during the 1940s, the exceedingly long work sched-
ules, and an attempt to address dermal uptake.
Petroleum fransportation and Distribution
Workers Study
A large epidemiology study of workers exposed to
petroleum products (containing benzene) has recently
been completed (85). The study reported a statistically
nonsignificant excess of AML in land-based distribution
workers that was not correlated with total hydrocarbon
exposure. A shortcoming of the study is that it did not
determine benzene concentrations but only exposure to
total petroleum hydrocarbons. An estimate of the con-
centration of benzene vapors could be made with some
degree of confidence; however, this analysis has yet to be
conducted.
Rushton et al. (198) and Schnatter et al. (200) also
recently reported the results of similar studies of
petroleum product distribution workers in the United
Kingdom and Canada. Both reports indicated that AML
SMRs were slightly elevated; however, the increases were
not statistically significant.
Evaluating Benzene's Cancer Dose-
Response Curve
It is unlikely that any specific case of environmental
leukemia can be directly related to exposure to very low
concentrations ofbenzene (or any chemical), nor is it likely
that an animal experiment (alone) can describe the rate of
response at low doses. Consequently, low-dose extrapola-
tion models must be used to predict the probability of
disease. The method or model used to estimate the leuke-

mia risks due to exposure to low doses of benzene has a
significant impact on regulations. Changes in the incidence
of disease or in the estimates of exposure tend to have
much smaller effect on the risk estimates than the low-
dose model selections.
The impact of model selection is well illustrated by
comparing the currently published cancer potency esti-
mates for benzene. The different potencies predict signifi-
cantly different acceptable concentrations for the same
risks. These differences are in part due to the choice of
epidemiology data but are largely a function of the model
selected. Table 11 presents a summary ofthe assumptions
used in the various models and the concentration of ben-
zene, which corresponds to a predicted excess lifetime
cancer risk of 1 in a million.
Current Federal policies require that human data be
used instead of animal data if the human data are suffi-
ciently robust. The epidemiology study most often used to
estimate the human risk of exposure to benzene -is the
rubber workers cohort (7,81,136,137). Many different
extrapolation models have been applied to these data to
identify safe levels ofexposure. As shown in Table 11, linear
models were used by the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and OSHA in the early 1980s. A modified
form of the linearized multistage was used by Crump and
Allen (197) and bythe EPA (145). Thorslund et al. (146) also
developed a revised estimate in 1988. In 1987, Rinsky et al.
used a conditional log-logistic model to predict the risk. As
of1993, none ofthese models has been identified as clearly
superior to the others.
Early Regulatory Assessments
Benzene was one of the first epidemiologically based
risk assessments conducted by the EPA (133). The Agency
based its evaluation upon the disease data on the Pliofllm
rubber workers and the Dow cohorts. Cumulative dose,
defined simply as the product of concentration and expo-
sure duration, was the index of exposure. The EPA used a
linear nonthreshold model to estimate risk. The results,
based on these studies, indicated that the 95% upper-
bound estimate of the probability of developing leukemia
in excess ofbackground rates following a working lifetime
ofexposure to 1 ppm ofbenzene was 14.9 per 1000 based on
the rubber worker data and 46.4 per 1000 based on the
Dow data (133).
White et al. (82,202) conducted the next assessment of
benzene. A cumulative dose was again used to predict risk
based on the Pliofilm and Dow cohorts. In deriving their
exposure measures, it was assumed that occupational
exposures were at the TLV concentrations at the time of
the exposure. In their analysis, workers with fewer than 5
years of work experience were excluded. A simple one-hit
model was used to predict the response. For exposure to 1
ppm, 8 hr/day, for 30 years, they predicted 3-11 excess
leukemia deaths per 1000 persons (based on the Pliofilm
cohort) and 3-10 excess leukemia deaths per 1000 persons
(based on the Dow cohort).
In 1984, Crump andAllen (197) developed an assessment
based on the work of Bond, the Pliofilm cohort, and the
original Dow cohorts (192). They also evaluated a number
of dosimetrics for predicting risks, including cumulative
dose, weighted cumulative dose, window dose, and peak
exposure dose. The cumulative dose is the same exposure
measure used by EPA in 1979 and by White et al. in 1982
(82). The weighted cumulative dose gives no weight to
exposures within the most recent 2.5 years and pro-
gressively less weight to exposures that occurred over the
past 7.5 years. The window dose considered exposure in
the 10-year window defined by 2.5 and 12.5 years in the
past and the peak exposure dose measured all cumulative
exposures that exceeded 100 ppm. The time intervals of
2.5, 7.5, and 12.5 years were selected based on the leukemia
rates and the time oftheir appearance in persons exposed
to radiation due to the bombing in Nagasaki and
Hiroshima.
Crump and Allen (197) used two mathematical
approaches, the relative risk and the absolute risk models,
to evaluate the relationship between leukemia risk and
exposure. The relative risk model assumes that incremen-
tal risk due to exposure to benzene will be proportional to
the background mortality in the group. The absolute risk
model assumes that the additional risk associated with
dose is the same for all age groups. A relative risk model
using cumulative dose and based on the combined rubber
workers and Dow cohorts predicted 7.5 excess leukemia
190
RISK ASSESSMENT FOR BENZENE
deaths per 1000 workers exposed to 1 ppm for 40 hr/week
for 30 years. An absolute risk model predicted two excess
leukemia deaths per 1000 workers for the same dose.
The authors expressed a preference for the cumulative
or weighted cumulative exposure approach because of the
leukemia experience in Japan. They noted "window expo-
sures allow the risk [of leukemia death associated with
benzene exposure] to disappear completely after 15 years,
which appears to be atvariance with the Japanese data [on
leukemia latency]" (197). The utility of the peak exposure
dose was examined by the authors in further analysis of
the Pliofilm cohort. In a separate analysis ofpersons with
200-plus ppm-year cumulative exposure, workers exposed
to benzene at levels less than 100 ppm were found to have
higher relative risks than workers with exposures greater
than 100 ppm. In light of this finding, this approach was
not considered credible.
EPA Assessment
Over the past 20 years, the EPA has developed quantita-
tive unit cancer risk estimates for nearly 150 known or
suspect carcinogens using a single methodology (203).
However, the standard procedure was not used when the
agency evaluated benzene (145). Instead, EPA adopted the
models developed originally by Crump and Allen. EPA
derived a cancer risk estimate from data obtained in three
different epidemiologic studies on workers exposed to
benzene vapors (81,191,192). Using an average derived
from the application of several models, EPA predicted a
risk of2.6 x 10-2 for exposure to 1 ppm benzene for a 24 hr/
day, 70 year-lifetime [equivalent to 0.029 mg/kg/day for
lifetime exposure]. Using this estimated potency value, the
air concentration associated with an excess risk of 10-6 was
40 ppt. Since this estimate was developed, two updates of
the cohort have been released [Rinsky (136) and Paxton
(138)]; however, EPA has not yet had an opportunity to
revise its risk assessment to incorporate the results.
Rinsky et al.
Rinsky et al. (136,137) developed an assessment of
occupational exposure based on a conditional logistic
model and additional follow-up data on the rubber worker
cohort. The conditional logistic model differed from the
assessment of White (82) and Crump and Allen (147) in
several ways. Specifically, the assessment was based only
on the rubber worker cohort and used a novel dose-
response model. In their assessment, Rinsky developed
detailed estimates of worker exposure that differed from
the estimates made by Crump and Allen (197). Based on
the results ofthe analysis, theyrecommended lowering the
occupational standard for benzene to 0.1 ppm. In 1990, the
American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygie-
nists (ACGIH) TLV committee proposed lowering the
TLV from 10 to 0.1 ppm (204). They plan to reach a final
decision on the most appropriate value in 1993 or 1994.
Thorslund et al.
A detailed reanalysis of the benzene cancer potency
factor was performed in 1988 by Thorslund et al. (146,147).
This reanalysis was based on the rubber workers cohort
and considered data from the 1981 update of the disease
incidence. The reanalysis also attempted to estimate
workers' exposures on an individual basis and did not lump
workers into dose groups. Finally, Thorsund et al. exam-
ined rigorously the dose-response relationship in the
cohort. The objectives of the evaluation were to test
whether the update ofthe cohort and better use ofexisting
exposure data would result in a significantly different
estimate ofpotency and whether the data from the rubber
worker cohort was best fit by a linear or nonlinear dose-
response model.
The effect of the various modifications in the reanalysis
are presented in Table 12. Two modifications (taken
together) had a relativelymajor effect on the linear model's
estimates: use of a more refined latency distribution to
obtain the exposure weighting function, and use of
rigorous statistical techniques that relied on individual
exposure estimates and time-to-tumor data, to estimate
the transition rate. Thorslund et al. (146) concluded that
using these more plausible assumptions, the linear model's
estimate of potency was overestimated by approximately
one order of magnitude.
Thorslund et al. (146) also concluded that there was
significant evidence that the dose-response curve for ben-
zene and AML was better fit by a nonlinear rather than a
linear model. They recommended using a quadratic model.
Thorslund et al. (146) also developed a model which had
both a linear and a quadratic term. The results of the
model were dictated by the quadratic term at high
(occupational) exposure levels and by the linear term at
low (environmental) exposures. Both of these models

resulted in lower estimates of potency than the linear
model (Table 12).
Thorslund et al. (146) concluded that the quadratic
equation is the best one for predicting the leukemia risk
observed in the Pliofilm cohort. This conclusion was based
on a) the empirical fit ofthe data to the quadratic equation
and b) biological evidence that a two-hit mechanism (i.e.,
two molecules of benzene or its metabolites must interact
with a cell's DNA to initiate cancer) is more likely than a
one-hit mechanism. The linear-quadratic model, which is
based on a conservative assumption about how back-
ground factors may influence the probability that benzene
can produce leukemia, was also presented as a reasonable
maximum upper bound of benzene risk.
Because the dose-response model used by a regulatory
agency has significant policy and regulatory implications,
a conference was convened in Georgetown in 1989 to
evaluate the reanalysis (147,205). At that workshop, par-
ticipants considered the linear quadratic model for
estimating the leukemogenic risks of benzene to be more
appropriate than the one-hit model. The participants also
concluded that a constant relative risk model was not
applicable for benzene-induced acute leukemias because
the Rinsky cohort does not show a constant relative risk
for acute leukemias as the cohort ages. Furthermore, they
concluded that the use of the absolute risk rather than
relative risk model is consistent with the EPA's policy
regarding the interpretation of animal data. The George-
town workshop (205) recommended that the human data
be fitted to other two-stage models and that a sensitivity
analysis be performed on models such as the two stage,
quadratic, and linear-quadratic, as well as the 1985
EPA model.
Reanalysis of Rubber Worker and Dow
Studies
Austin et al. (206) surveyed the evidence for benzene
toxicity, examined previous risk estimates, and provided
an updated risk assessment using the rubber worker and
Dow cohorts. These authors modeled the number ofexcess
leukemia deaths associated with various exposure levels.
Their model was based on the assumption that "the pro-
portional excess leukemia mortality observed during the
follow-up period will continue until all cohort members
have died" (206). Using this risk estimation model and a
target cumulative exposure of30 ppm-years (1 ppm, for 40
hr/week for 30 years), 51-83 excess leukemia deaths per
1000 exposed were predicted based on the Pliofilm cohort
and 47 excess leukemia deaths per 1000 exposed were
predicted based on the Dow cohort.
Brett et al.
Brett et al. (207) conducted a risk assessment that was
to a large degree a sensitivity analysis of Rinsky et al.
(136). They agreed that the rubber worker cohort provided
the best basis for estimating the risk ofleukemia and that
no other epidemiology study is as appropriate. They
showed that the Rinsky model was fairly sensitive to the
estimates of employee exposure. For example, when the
exposure estimates developed by Crump and Allen were
applied to their model, the risks associated with 1-ppm
(working lifetime) exposures decreased significantly.
Brett et al.'s reevaluation of the data indicates that past
assessments may have overestimated the cancer risk by a
factor of3-24. Based on the data of Rinsky et al. (136) and
exposure matrices of Crump and Allen (197), a risk esti-
mate of 7.9 excess leukemia deaths per 1000 workers
exposed to 10 ppm for 45 years and for those persons
exposed to 1 ppm for 45 years might have an excess of 0.5
leukemia deaths per 1000.
Paxton et al.
Paxton et al. (138) evaluated the impact of the recent
update of leukemias in the rubber worker's cohort and the
new the exposure estimates of Paustenbach et al. (47) on
the dose-response curves. They found that the update and
the new exposure estimates gave further support to the
risk estimates proposed by Brett et al. (207). The study
also concluded that because no cases of leukemia are
observed in workers who started employment after 1950,
the observed increase in leukemia may be the result of a
threshold response to very high levels that occurred in the
early years of the manufacturing process.
Human Exposure
Dermal Uptake
Benzene is readily absorbed through the skin of man
(208,209) and animals (210-212). In general, studies in
humans suggest a dermal uptake rate in the forearm of0.4
mg/cm2-hr (209). Paustenbach et al. (47) suggested that
under certain occupational circumstances, dermal absorp-
tion can make a signifiecant contribution (about 10-25%) of
the worker's total uptake.
In contrast to liquid absorption, the dermal uptake of
benzene from contaminated soil has been modeled by
McKone et al. (213) and Burmaster et al. (214). They
showed that benzene is poorly absorbed from a soil matrix
and that even under ideal conditions (extensive contact for
long periods of time), less than 10% of benzene in soil will
be absorbed by the skin.
Occupational Exposure
Occupational exposure to benzene involves airborne
concentrations that are 100- to 1000-fold greater than
environment levels. Occupational exposure to benzene has
decreased greatly over the past 40 years as a result of
lowering occupational exposure limits like the TLV and by
discontinuing the use of benzene as a solvent. Currently,
significant exposure to benzene is limited to the workers in
the petroleum, coal (coking operations), and synthetic
organic chemical industries. Under the current OSHA
PEL, workplace exposures may not exceed 1 ppm. In the
petroleum industry, 8-hr TWA exposures are generally
kept below 0.3 ppm (215). Dermal exposure to benzene in
the petroleum industries is generally controlled under
192
RISK ASSESSMENT FOR BENZENE
OSHA requirements; however, dermal exposure to gas-
oline and benzene in small workplaces (less than 10
employees) can be significant due to less stringent indus-
trial hygiene practices.
Community Exposure
Due to the ubiquitous presence of benzene in the
environment, the general population is exposed daily to
varying levels of benzene. Iypical sources of exposure
include cigarette smoking, use of certain consumer prod-
ucts, inhalation of indoor and outdoor air, pumping gas-
oline (self-service gas stations), and riding in an
automobile (8). During the 1980s, EPA performed exten-
sive investigations (the TEAM studies) of the general
population's exposure to volatile organic compounds such
as benzene (8,9,216,217). The TEAM studies found that the
most important source ofexposure for the general popula-
tion is mainstream cigarette smoke inhaled by smokers.
The source accounted for 39% of the total uptake of
benzene in the U.S. population (9). In addition, environ-
mental tobacco smoke (ETS) contributes an additional 5%
of the nation's exposure. The second largest source (20%)
of nationwide exposure is attributed to various personal
activities, which include exposures related to automobile
use. Atmospheric emissions (auto exhaust and industrial
emissions) account for only about 20% of total exposure
(Fig. 3).
A number of sources sometimes considered important,
such as petroleum refining operations, petrochemical
manufacturing, oil storage tanks, urban-industrial areas,
service stations, certain foods, groundwater contamina-
tion, and underground gasoline leaks, appear to be rela-
tively unimportant on a nationwide basis (9).
The TEAM studies finding that smoking is the largest
source of human uptake of benzene is consistent with
chemical analyses of cigarette smoke. Loforth et al. (219)
measured an average of 500 pg ofbenzene produced from
an individual cigarette. Wester et al. (220) and Wallace and
Pellizzari (217) also reported that average benzene breath
levels of smokers are significantly elevated over non-
smokers.
Industry (14%)
l _ _~~~~Pesonal
AutDs (82%)
Elevated levels of benzene in indoor air represent an
additional source of exposure. Wallace et al. (8,9,216,217)
reported the results of the EPA TEAM studies that
benzene levels in the home are generally elevated over
outdoor levels. These elevated concentrations are largely
due to ETS, use ofpetroleum products, and other sources
(9,221).
Although benzene is relatively soluble in water (1.8 g/L at
25°C), the potential for human exposure through water
consumption is limited. Benzene's volatility and bio-
degradability results in low levels in surface water (17,18).
Levels of benzene in public drinking water supplies are
nondetectable generally (>0.5 g/L). Benzene can be a
contaminant in shallow groundwater due to leaking under-
ground storage tanks, but the number of individuals
affected by such contamination is small. Under the current
EPA drinking water standards, benzene levels in public
water supplies cannot exceed 5 jg/L.
Benzene has been reported as a low-level component ofa
large number of foods,(35,222). NCI (35) estimated that
many Americans currently ingest as much as 250 pLg/day
from their diet. However, a recent study performed by the
American Petroleum Institute contradicts these findings.
The study examined foods that the literature indicated to
contain significant amounts of benzene. Benzene levels in
these foods were found to be either very low or nondetect-
able. Based on these results, the American Petroleum
Institute (API) concluded that benzene is unlikely to occur
in food at levels of toxicological significance (201). This
finding is consistent with analyses of the TEAM studies
data that concluded that 99% of benzene exposure occurs
via inhalation (9). Travis (18) also concluded that based on
the physicochemical properties of benzene, diet was
unlikely to be a significant source of exposure.
Although benzene is now rarely used as a bulk solvent
(15), trace levels of benzene can still occur in certain
consumer products. Wallace (9) reported that 400 of
approximately 5000 materials and products tested by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
were found to emit benzene vapors in concentrations rang-
ing from 0.01 ppm to 140 ppm. These products include
paints, adhesives, pens, rubber products, carpeting, liquid

detergent, furniture wax, and building materials. A survey
of products containing volatile organics found that a simi-
lar percentage of products contained low but measurable
amounts of benzene (223).
TEAM data have shown that the major sources of
emission of benzene are not necessarily the most signifi-
cant sources of human exposure. For example, indoor air
concentrations of benzene are significantly higher than
outdoor concentrations (217). Figure 3 presents a com-
parison of the air concentrations in the Los Angeles area
and the sources of exposure (218). Autos and industry
contribute (96%) to the outdoor airborne levels ofbenzene,
but human uptake of benzene is determined primarily
(79%) by cigarettes, indoor air, and personal factors.
Risk Characterization
Table 13 presents an analysis by Wallace (9) on the
magnitude of risks offered by exposures to various
sources ofbenzene. His estimates are based on the cancer
potency models used currently by EPA (145). For com-
parison purposes, the risks from acceptable levels of ben-
zene in public drinking water supplies exposures also has
been included.
These estimates of population risks indicate that while
occupational exposure may involve relatively high airborne
concentrations ofbenzene, the bulk ofbenzene update and
risk results from nonoccupational exposures. Smoking is
the dominant source of benzene exposure and risk. How-
ever, Wallace estimated that nonsmoking, nonoccupational
benzene exposures result in some 400 cancer cases per
year. As Table 11 indicates, estimates ofrisk from benzene
vary considerably among published risk assessments.
Using the linear-quadratic model of Thorslund et al. (146)
for example, results in an estimate of nonsmoking, nonoc-
cupational risks of less than 10 per year in the United
States.
Regulatory Issues
Occupational Exposure Limits
Recommendations to limit exposure to benzene in the
workplace came soon after the hazard posed by benzene
toxicity was recognized. Serious episodes of benzene tox-
icity in the rotogravure printing industry in New York
(224) were in part responsible for the setting of occupa-
tional standards for benzene, which were recommended by
the newly formed ACGIH in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

The ACGIH establishes TLVs that are voluntary guide-
lines and do not carry the force of law; however, many
industries have historically attempted to comply with
them.
Table 9 shows how benzene standards changed over
time. In 1971 the OSHA standard was reduced to 10 ppm
and by 1974, when OSHA and the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) suggested addi-
tional regulations, the 10 ppm TWA standard was comple-
mented with a 25-ppm ceiling value (36). In 1976, OSHA
and NIOSH reached the conclusion that benzene was a
leukemogen and that a 10-ppm standard was not sufficient
to protect workers (207). In 1977, OSHA first proposed
lowering the occupational benzene standard from 10 ppm
to 1 ppm on the basis of its qualitative assessment of the
leukemia risk. Their permanent standard was not, how-
ever, supported by the U.S. Supreme Court on the basis
that OSHA had not demonstrated that a significant risk
existed at the previous 10-ppm standard (149). In 1987,
OSHAset the standard at 1 ppmfor an 8-hrday(TWA) and
5 ppm for 15 min (134). NIOSH (132) recommended that
the occupational exposure standard for benzene be
revised to a 10-hr TWA of 0.1 ppm with a 15-min ceiling
value of 1 ppm.
In 1991, the ACGIH proposed that benzene be listed on
the Chemical Substances TLV Notice of Intended
Changes of 1990-1991 at 0.1 ppm as a TWA with a skin
notation and designation as a Al carcinogen (confirmed
human) (204). The recommended TLV of 0.1 ppm is less
than the concentration associated with genetic damage in
animals (150) and is less than the concentrations associ-
ated with genetic damage in human beings (161). Because
calculations show that the dermal absorption of benzene
can contribute substantially to the total absorbed benzene
dose (208,209), the skin designation was retained.
This proposed reduction is under considerable debate.
Paxton et al. (138) has shown that the original carcinogenic
risk assessment (137) considered by ACGIH likely over-
estimates carcinogenic risks. Currently, Infante and oth-
ers question this conclusion and believe the 0.1-ppm value
is necessary to provide adequate protection.
Air Toxics Regulations
The EPA has regulated industrial emissions of benzene
under the Clean Air Act's provision for the National Emis-
sion Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) in
1981 and again in 1988 and 1989. These regulations have
focused on the petroleum, chemical, and steel industries
(225-227).
Under the revised Clean Air Act of 1990, emissions of
benzene and other toxins from industrial sources will be
controlled using technology-based standards. In addition,
the maximum concentration ofbenzene in gasoline will be
limited to 1% by volume. In addition to the direct regula-
tion of benzene emissions, regulations that control hydro-
carbon emissions also have reduced the amount ofbenzene
emitted by stationary sources.

RISK ASSESSMENT FOR BENZENE 195
Drinking Water
In 1985, the EPA Office of Drinking Water proposed
setting the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for ben-
zene in drinking water at 0.005 mg/L (228). This standard
was promulgated in 1987 (229). Because of benzene's
known carcinogenicity, EPA's Office of Drinking Water
has set the maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) for
benzene in drinkingwater at 0 (229). The MCLG cannot be
enforced. The Office of Drinking Water used the EPA
estimates of benzene's carcinogenic potency to estimate
the benzene concentrations in drinking water that corres-
pond to carcinogenic risks of 10-4, 10-5, and 10-6. The
concentrations were 68, 6.8, and .068 ,ug/L, respectively
(229). In the 1980s, the National Research Council (NRC)
(230) derived a short-term seven-day standard of12.6 mg/
L for benzene in drinking waters using the data of Wolf
et al. (40).
Conclusion
Although several hundred papers have been written
over the past 50 years about the health hazards posed by
benzene, we are not yet able to precisely identify the
cancer potency factor for humans. There are several rea-
sons for this: first, insufficient time has passed to allow a
complete determination of long-term effects in the key
occupational cohorts; second, we are not certainwhich low-
dose extrapolation model is likelyto give the most accurate
estimate of risk. As has been noted in the assessment of
many carcinogens, the estimates generated by currently
accepted dose-response models are generally the max-
imum plausible ones and the actual risk at low doses may
be zero. A third problem is the absence ofan animal model
of benzene leukemogenesis, which prevents the direct
investigation ofthe mechanism for benzene's carcinogenic
effects in humans.
Fortunately, more and better information is being devel-
oped on the metabolism ofbenzene in humans and animals,
and it is hoped that PBPK models will allow us to quan-
titatively understand the likely human health hazard at
low doses. Information on metabolism and indirect infor-
mation on the likely mechanism of action, coupled with
better estimates ofexposure for the cohorts being studied,
would be able to provide more accurate estimates of the
cancer risk at doses to which the general population is
being exposed currently. Until then, it is likely that the
EPA and other agencies will choose to regulate benzene in
ambient air based on the incidence data from the rubber
worker's cohort, the most recent exposure estimates for
that group, and models that are considered most appropri-
ate for benzene and/or for leukemia.
Thanks are given to Carol Gillis, Peter Beatty, Peter Craig, and
Richard Russell for their review of the paper.
