Abstract
We studied serum proteomic profiling in patients with graft versus host disease (GVHD) after
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
(2-DE) and mass spectrometry analysis. The expression of a group of proteins, haptoglobin (Hp),
alpha-1-antitrypsin, apolipoprotein A-IV, serum paraoxonase and Zn-alpha-glycoprotein were
increased and the proteins, clusterin precursor, alpha-2-macroglobulin, serum amyloid protein
precursor, sex hormone-binding globulin, serotransferrin and complement C4 were decreased in
patients with extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD). Serum haptoglobin (Hp) levels in patients with
cGVHD were demonstrated to be statistically higher than in patients without cGVHD and normal
controls (p < 0.01). We used immunoblotting and PCR in combination with 2-DE gel image analysis
to determine Hp polymorphisms in 25 allo-HCT patients and 16 normal donors. The results
demonstrate that patients with cGVHD had a higher incidence of HP 2-2 phenotype (43.8%), in
comparison to the patients without cGVHD (0%) and normal donors (18.7%), suggesting the
possibility that specific Hp polymorphism may play a role in the development of cGVHD after allo-
HCT. In this study, quantitative serum Hp levels were shown to be related to cGVHD
development. Further, the data suggest the possibility that specific Hp polymorphisms may be
associated with cGVHD development and warrant further investigation.

Introduction
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (Allo-HCT)
has been a potentially curative treatment approach for
patients with hematological malignancies, lympho-
hematopoietic failure, autoimmune diseases as well as
genetic disorders. Despite its curative potential, the appli-
cation of allo-HCT is limited by life-threatening complica-
tions, in particular, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a
highly morbid toxic complication [1,2]. As a clinical syn-
drome related to the reaction of donor-derived immuno-
competent cells against patient tissues, GVHD remains the
most frequent transplant-related complication.
GVHD is classified as a clinicopathologic syndrome
involving skin, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and/or other
organs. Currently, there are no reliable laboratory tests
that will confirm or refute its presence. Thus, GVHD is
mostly a clinical diagnosis. Diagnosis of GVHD requires
an interpretation of clinical and laboratory findings, rec-
ognizing that in some patients the differential diagnosis
may be difficult to resolve [3]. To predict development
and clinical prognosis of GVHD, several in vitro tests have
been described. However, results have been difficult to
reproduce and no assay has been widely adopted [3-7].

ing tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, inter-
leukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6 and IL-10, as well as polymorphisms
of certain adhesive molecules such as CD31 and CD54
have been extensively conducted to explore their potential
for GVHD risk prediction and the development of predict-
able genetic risk indexes. However, these efforts have not
yet resulted in reliable models [3,8-13].
Over the past decade, the study of proteomics has rapidly
evolved and developed. Proteomics studies can generate
protein expression profiles which may predict clinical
events, therapeutic response, or probe underlying mecha-
nisms of disease. Proteome analysis is emerging as an
important technology for understanding biological proc-
esses and discovery of novel biomarkers in diseases such
as autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular diseases and
cancers [14-17]. A recent study used an intact-protein-
based quantitative analysis system for determining the
plasma proteome profile of patients with acute GVHD
after transplant. The proteins, including amyloid A, apol-
ipoproteins A-I/A-IV and complement C3 were found to
be quantitatively different between the pre- and post-
GVHD samples [18]. In another report, several differen-
tially excreted polypeptides were identified from patient
urine samples by a capillary electrophoresis and mass
spectrometry (CE-MS) based technique. The peptide pro-
file displayed a pattern of early GVHD markers, allowing
discrimination of GVHD from patients without the com-
plication [19]. These reports hinted that GVHD can be
monitored by changes in protein expression patterns
detectable through proteomic methods.
Few investigations utilizing proteomic profiling in the
study of patients with and without GVHD after allo-HCT
have been reported to date. Several contributions in this
regard have recently been reported to be confirmatory of
a clinical diagnosis of acute GVHD (aGVHD) and to pro-
vide prognostic information. Paczesny et al have devel-
oped a panel consistent of 4 biomarkers which both
confirm the diagnosis of aGVHD at onset of clinical symp-
toms and provide prognostic information independent of
aGVHD severity [20]. Weissinger, et al have described an
aGVHD-specific model consisting of 31 polypeptides and
Hori et al have correlated a member of a large chemokine
family, CCL8 to be closely correlated with aGVHD sever-
ity through proteomic analysis [21,22].
In this study, we performed serum proteomic profiling in
a group of patients with and without cGVHD after allo-
HCT by 2-dimensional electrophoreses (2-DE) and mass
spectrometry based technology. Differential expression
patterns of 11 serum proteins were demonstrated in
patients before and after cGVHD development. Serum Hp
precursors, one of the 11 differentially expressed serum
proteins, were found to be significantly up-regulated dur-
ing cGVHD development. We also investigated the rela-
tionship between serum Hp quantity as well as Hp
polymorphisms and cGVHD development in this study.
Serum Hp level as well as its polymorphisms were shown
to be related to cGVHD development. Thus, Hp might
serve as a worthy future target for monitoring cGVHD and
understanding cGVHD mechanism.

Methods
Patients
Twenty-five patients who received allo-HCT at Saint
Luke's Cancer Institute were studied. The 25 patients
included 14 males and 11 females and the median age
was 48 years (range 23–61 year old). Details of diagnostic
indication for transplant are delineated in table 1. Sixteen
patients developed cGVHD and 9 patients developed no
cGVHD after allo-HCT. Samples were collected prior to
transplant from each patient and at approximately 20 and
150 days, 6 months and 1 year or at the time of initial
diagnosis of cGVHD (before initiation of steroid based
therapy) in the BMT clinic and then periodically during
follow up visits in patients with active cGVHD. Initial
therapy of cGVHD included tacrolimus continuation or
re-initiation and prednisone at 1 mg/kg daily. None of the
25 patients had a clinical diagnosis of transplant associ-
ated microangiopathy.
Sixteen normal healthy donors, 10 males and 6 females,
were included as controls in this study. Median age of the
normal donors was 38 years (range 20–55).
Serum processing
Peripheral blood samples were obtained, with informed
consent, during routine diagnostic blood studies from

patients before and after allo-HSCT in Saint Luke's Cancer
Institute (SLCI). Serum samples were collected and aliq-
uoted into 300 μl per tube from whole blood specimens,
allowed to stand over night at 4°C without anti-coagulant
and stored at -80°C in a freezer. Mononuclear cells
(MNC) were isolated by Ficoll Hypaque density gradient
separation and cyropreserved in liquid nitrogen. Serum
albumin was removed by Swellgel Blue Albumin Removal
kit (Pierce biotechnology, Rockford IL) following the
instructions provided by the kit. 150 ul of serum was
loaded for each single reaction. After preparing resin disc,
binding sample and washing to release albumin-free sam-
ple, the albumin-free serum was collected for determina-
tion of protein concentration. The protein concentration
was determined by the Dc Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad, Her-
cules CA) and following the instructions provided by the
kit.
2-Dimensional protein gel electrophoresis
2-DE was performed as previously described with certain
modifications [23]. Briefly, 500 μg of serum protein resus-
pended in rehydration buffer (8 M urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.5%
immobilized pH gradient [IPG] buffer, 1% DTT, and trace
of bromophenol blue) was loaded into an immobiline
DryStrip (pI 4–7, 13 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) for
rehydration over 18 hr. The first dimension isoelectric
focusing was performed for 46,000 Vhr using a multiPhor
II IEF System (Amersham) at 20°C. Then, the gels were
equilibrated for 30 minutes in equilibration buffer I (50
mM Tris-HCL [pH 8.8], 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS,
and 0.1% DTT) and buffer II (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.8], 6
M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.25% iodoaceta-
mide). The second dimension electrophoresis was con-
ducted according to the Hoefer SE 600 system operating
manual (Amersham). A gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel
(7%–12%) was used for the second dimension gel electro-
phoresis. The IPG strips were placed on the surface of the
second dimension gel, and then the IPG strips were sealed
with 0.5% agarose in SDS electrophoresis buffer (25 mM
Tris base, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS). The gels were run
over 4 hrs at 110 V.
Silver staining
Silver staining was performed according to a protocol
published previously [23]. Briefly, gels were fixed with
50% methanol/10% acetic acid for 30 minutes and 5%
methanol/1% acetic acid for 15 minutes respectively, and
then the gels were washed by distilled water 3 times for 10

minutes each time. After washing, the gels were sensitized
by incubation in sensitizing solution (0.02% sodium thi-
osulphate) for 90 seconds, and then rinsed with distilled
water 3 times for 30 seconds each time. After rinsing, the
gels were incubated in 0.2% silver nitrate for 30 minutes.
The silver nitrate was then discarded and the gels were
rinsed with distilled water 3 times for 1 minute each time
and then developed with 0.02% formaldehyde and
0.0004% sodium thiosulphate in 6% sodium carbonate
with shaking. The development was terminated with 6%
acetic acid.
Image analysis
The silver-stained 2-DE gels were scanned with LabScan
software on an UMAX Powerlook III scanner (UMAX Tech
Inc, California), and the images were digitalized and ana-
lyzed with a α-GelFox 2D 3.1 (Alpha Innotech) software.
In-gel digestion and protein identification by LC-MS/MS
Protein spots were cut out from the silver-stained gels for
in-gel digestion. Proteins were reduced and alkylated
before digestion with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI)
overnight at 37°C. The peptides were extracted from the
gel and concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge. 8 μL of con-
centrated peptide mixtures was injected to an Agilent LC-
MSD ion trap mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies,
USA) for identification. Mass spectra were acquired in
positive-ion mode with automated data-dependent MS/
MS on the four most intense ions from precursor MS
scans. The mass spectra were extracted and searched
against the human database using Mascot software.
Serum haptoglobin determination by Elisa Assay
Serum Hp determination was use AssayMax human Hp
ELISA kit and followed the Elisa kit protocol provided by
manufacturer (Assaypro St. Charles MO). Pooled human
normal serum control (PNS), which contains serum
derived from 20 normal donors, was purchased from
George King Bio-Medical. INC. (Overland Park, KS).
Haptoglobin genotype determination by PCR
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood MNC
by the QIAamp DNA Kit as suggested by the supplier
(Qiagen). Oligonucleotide primers A (5'-GAG-
GGGAGCTTGCCTTTCCATTG-3') and B (5'-GAGATTTTT-
GAGCCCTGGCTGGT-3') were used for amplification of a
1757-bp Hp-1 allele-specific sequence and a 3481-bp Hp-
2 allele-specific sequence. Primers C (5'-CCTGCCTCG-
TATTAACTGCACCAT-3') and D (5'-CCGAGTGCTCCA-
CATAGCC ATGT-3') were used to amplify a 349-bp Hp-2
allele-specific sequence [24]. The oligonucleotide primers
were synthesized by IDT, Inc (Coralville IA). 20-μL reac-
tions contained 2 U of Taq polymerase (Promega), 1–100
ng of DNA, and 200 μM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and
dTTP (Promega); PCR buffer was used as suggested by the
supplier (Promega) with no supplements added. After ini-
tial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, the two-step thermo-
cycling procedure consisted of denaturation at 95°C for 1
min and annealing and extension at 69°C for 2 min (in
the presence of primers A and B or primers A, B, C, and D)
or 1 min (in the presence of primers C and D only),
repeated for 35 cycles, and followed by a final extension
at 72°C for 7 min. The thermocycler used was Perkin
Elmer 480 PCR system. For genotype assignments, the
PCR products where primers A and B were used were sep-
arated in 1% agarose gels and products where primers C
and D were used were separated in 8% polyacrylamide
gels.
Restriction enzyme analysis was performed to verify the
identity of Hp-1- and Hp-2-specific PCR products. The
1757-and 3481-bp products were digested with restriction
enzyme MlsI, and the 349-bp product was digested with
DraI, as recommended by the supplier (MBI Fermentas).
DNA fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis.
Immunoblot
Immunoblot were performed as previously published
with modifications [25]. Briefly, 1 μL of human serum in
20 μL of sample loading buffer [10 g/L sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS), 100 mL/L glycerol, 25 mmol/L Tris (pH
6.8), 0.05 g/L bromphenol blue, and 50 mL/L β-mercap-
toethanol] mixture were boiled at 95°C for 5 min, then
the boiled samples were loaded on a 15% polyacrylamide
gel. Standard Hp protein (Sigma Chemical Co.) was
diluted to 1 g/L and treated in the same way as a control.
Samples were electrophoresed in 25 mmol/L Tris base-
192 mmol/L glycine-1 g/L SDS running buffer for 45 min
at 150 V and then transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio
Rad, California). The membranes were blocked in 5% Dry
milk in Tris-buffered Tween [TBST; 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5 mL/L Tween 20] for 1 h

and then incubated at 4°C overnight with a 1:1000 dilu-
tion of polyclonal rabbit anti-human Hp antibody
(Sigma). After washing the membranes three times in
TBST, a second antibody, anti-rabbit IgG horse radish per-
oxidase conjugate (Santa Crus, California) was used at a
dilution 1:2000 in TBST; the membranes were then incu-
bated at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were
washed three times in TBST and finally developed with
Luminal Reagent (Santa Crus).
Statistical analysis
Statistical comparison of the serum Hp levels and 2-DE
gel Hp protein spots VI among the different study groups
was done using the Waller-Duncan K-ratio t test.
Results
Changes of protein expression patterns before and after

Thirty-six serum specimens derived from 16 patients and
9 samples from normal donors were subjected to 2-DE gel
and silver staining assays. Out of the 36 patient-derived
samples, 13 were collected before transplantation. Out of
the 23 patient derived samples collected after allo-HCT, 9
samples were collected prior to the cGVHD occurring and
9 during cGVHD development, 5 were from the patients
with no cGVHD development at all after receiving allo-
HCT. The median number of protein spots in 2-DE gels
was 709 (range 499–1012 spots) for the specimens from
patients pre-transplantation; 637 (458–806 spots) in
samples from prior to or no cGVHD development
patients; 760 (508–1031 spots) in the serum from
patients with active cGVHD and 735 (645–783 spots) in
the serum of normal donors.
Paired 2-DE gel analyses were performed using 2-DE gel
software between the serum collected prior to cGVHD and
the samples of active cGVHD phase from the same indi-
vidual patient. Protein spot patterns were significantly dif-
ferent between the gels of pre-cGVHD and active cGVHD
phase in the same patient. The median protein spot num-
bers were determined as 753 (range 610–1012) and 726
(508–1031) for the specimens pre and post-cGVHD in the
7 patients with cGVHD, respectively. Median of matched
spots between paired gels was 501 (405–725, median and
range), however, in comparison to the gels pre-cGVHD,
the medians for missing spots and newly appeared spots
were 248 (190–391) and 276 (117–373), respectively in
the gels of cGVHD.
A group of protein spots in the 2-DE gels was found signif-
icantly and consistently different between the serum col-
lected prior to and during the cGVHD development from
various patients. The protein spots, which were collected
and analyzed from a paired representative 2-DE gels by
LC-MS/MS are demonstrated in Figure 1. The sum of the
spot areas multiple spot density as the volume index (VI)
was used to determine the individual serum protein level
in 2-DE gel semi-quantitatively. Five proteins, including
Hp, apolipoprotein A-IV, α-1-antitrypsin, serum paraoxo-
nase and Zn-α-glycoprotein were found quantitatively

increased or newly appearing after cGVHD development.
A group of 5 proteins were either down-regulated or
absent in the 2-DE gel of patient with cGVHD, including
sex hormone-binding globulin, clusterin precursor, serum
amyloid A protein precursor, serotransferrin and comple-
ment C4 (Table 2). As a representative of protein spots
analyzed, the mass spectrum identification of Hp by LC-
MS/MS analysis is shown in Figure 2.
Differential expression patterns of haptoglobin in cGVHD
development
As a particular example, Hp expression patterns were
demonstrated to be significantly different among the
patients with and without cGVHD development in our 2-
DE gel analysis. To quantitatively compare the differences
in Hp spot volumes between the different study groups by
2-DE gel image analyses, we used VI to determine the
serum Hp level semi-quantitatively. Since the complexity
of Hp α chain polymorphisms and that the Hp β chain are
identical in all haptoglobin phenotypes, we selected the
VI of Hp precursor β as the representative of Hp volumes
in each study groups. The VIs in the cGVHD group (n = 6),
was demonstrated to be significantly higher than the VIs
of the patients before transplantation (n = 12; p = 0.027);
patients with no cGVHD after transplantation (n = 4; p =
0.045) and normal donor group (n = 9; p = 0.044), respec-
tively (Table 3).
The differential expression patterns of Hp in individual
patients in paired 2-DE gels before and after cGVHD are
demonstrated in Figure 3. Both volume and density of the
Hp protein spots were shown to increase in the gels of
cGVHD paired-set in all 3 patients irrespective of Hp phe-
notype differences. Figure 3a is from a cGVHD patient,
who has an Hp β and an Hp α-1s chain, indicating an Hp
1-1 phenotype. The patient's Hp spot VI was 24.4 × 105
(Hp β) and 0.1 × 105 (Hp α-1s) before cGVHD and 295.1
× 105 (Hp β) and 29.4 × 105(Hp α-1s) after cGVHD,
respectively; 3b shows the 2-DE Hp pattern of a different
cGVHD patient, who has Hp β, α-1s and α-2 chain which
indicates a Hp 2-1 phenotype. The Hp spot VI was 91.0 ×
105 (Hp β), 3.5 × 105 (α-1s) and 12.2 × 105 (α-2) before
cGVHD and 140.9 × 105 (β), 4.8 × 105 (α-1s) and 18.7 ×
105 (α-2) after cGVHD, respectively; Figure 3c represent
the Hp expression patterns from another cGVHD patient.
The patient expressed an Hp β and α-2 protein spots, sug-
gesting an Hp 2-2 phenotype. The VI of 3c was 5.4 × 105
(Hp β) and 2.7 × 105 (α-2) before cGVHD and 274.9 × 105
(Hp β) and 67.7 × 105 (α-2) after cGVHD.
Serum Hp levels in the patients before and after cGVHD
development
We performed Elisa assays to confirm the prior finding
and compared serum Hp levels in patients before and
after cGVHD. Hp levels were examined in the serum from
the same patient before and after cGVHD development, as
well as normal donors. The mean of Hp concentration
was 1.97 ± 0.99 mg/ml (mean ± SD) in the patients with
cGVHD (n = 14); 0.83 ± 0.40 in the patients before trans-
plantation (n = 23); 0.74 ± 0.51 in the patients with no

cGVHD development after transplantation (n = 6) and
0.82 ± 0.31 mg/ml in the control group of normal donors
(n = 16 and 5 PNS). Statistical analysis demonstrated that
the serum Hp level in the cGVHD group was significantly
higher than all the other 3 groups (p < 0.01). The differ-
ences of the serum Hp level were insignificant between
the 3 cGVHD-negative groups (Figure 4).
Determination of Hp polymorphisms in the patients
In humans, Hp is characterized by a molecular heteroge-
neity with three main genotypes/phenotypes: Hp 1-1, Hp
2-1, and Hp 2-2. These different proteins have distinctive
efficiencies and it has been suggested that the polymor-
phism may have important biological consequences in
several diseases [26]. To probe the possible relationship
between cGVHD and Hp polymorphism, we used immu-
noblot and PCR in combination with 2-DE gel image
analysis to determine Hp polymorphisms in the 24 allo-
HCT patients of this study group as well as 12 normal
donors. Serum Hp phenotype was determined by immu-
noblot using polyclonal antibody, which recognize Hp β,
α-1 and α-2 chains and the Hp phenotypes in the patients
are shown in Figure 5. To verify the Hp phenotype in these
patients, we examined Hp genotypes of the patients by
PCR assay (figure 6), and the Hp PCR products were fur-
ther confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis (figure 7
and 8). All the DNA typing of the samples derived from 25
patients were matched with their phenotypes determined
by immunoblot.
Out of 16 patients with cGVHD, 2 (12.5%, 1 limited and
1 extensive) had an Hp 1-1 type; 7 (43.8%, 4 extensive
and 3 limited) were 2-1 and 7 (43.8%, 6 extensive and 1
limited) were Hp 2-2 type (Table 4). In comparison with
normal donors, patients with cGVHD had a higher inci-
dence of Hp 2-2 phenotype (43.8%) and a lower inci-
dence of Hp 2-1 (43.8%) type than the normal donors
(18.7%, p < 0.01) and (75.0%, p < 0.05), respectively. In
addition, out of 9 patients in whom no cGVHD occurred,
8 (88.9%, p < 0.01) were Hp 2-1 type and 1 (11.1%) was
1-1 type, but no 2-2 type was detected (Table 4), suggest-
ing that the patients with Hp 2-2 phenotype might have
more genetic susceptibility or tendency for cGVHD devel-
opment.
Discussion
Proteome analysis is now emerging as an important tech-
nology for deciphering biological processes and is aiding
in the discovery of biomarkers for diseases from tissues
and body fluids. In this study, we examined serum pro-
teomic profiles in a group of patients with cGVHD after
allo-HCT by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)
and mass spectrometry based technology. A panel of pro-
teins, Hp alpha-1-antitrypsin, apolipoprotein A-IV, serum
paraoxonase and Zn-alpha-glycoprotein were demon-
strated to be up-regulated and clusterin precursor, alpha-
2-macroglobulin, serum amyloid protein precursor, sex

hormone-binding globulin, serotransferrin and comple-
ment 4 were found down-regulated in the patients with
cGVHD.
Medical literature in the area of proteomic profiling in
GVHD is scarce [18,19,27]. One study has used an intact-
protein-based quantitative analysis combined with pro-
tein tagging and immunodepletion of abundant proteins
to quantitatively profile the plasma proteome in the
patients with acute GVHD after transplant [18]. In this
study, plasma samples were subjected to immunodeple-
tion chromatography to remove six of the most-abundant
plasma proteins (albumin, transferrin, IgG, IgA, Hp and
α-1-antitrypsin) to increase the sensitivity of serum low
abundant protein detection. However, it is not clear
whether or not serum high abundant proteins such as Hp,
transferrin and immunoglobin, est., are involved in the
pathophysiology of cGVHD. In our study, high abundant
proteins including Hp, alpha-1-antitrypsin and transferrin
exhibited quantitative differences between the pre- and
post-GVHD samples, which suggest that those proteins
might be importantly involved in the pathophysiologic
processes of cGVHD. Therefore, the potential role of these
high abundant proteins in the development and propaga-
tion of cGVHD should be fully assessed before being
methodically eliminated in proteomic profiling studies.
Increased serum Zn-alpha-glycoprotein and decreased
complement C4 in patients with cGVHD in our study
were in agreement with this report [18]. In contrast, serum
amyloid protein and alpha-2-macroglobulin, which were
increased in their study, were down-regulated in our study
[18]. One possible explanation might be that the immun-
odepletion process affected their results.
In our study, Hp was identified as one of the increased
proteins after cGVHD onset. Both the results of Hp vol-
ume index in 2-DE gel image analysis and serum Elisa
assay demonstrated a significant increase of Hp in
patients with cGVHD. Hp is an acute-phase response
serum protein that has been known to play an important
inhibitory role in inflammation and the Hp plasma con-
centration may increase in response to a variety of stimuli,
such as: infection, neoplasia, and other inflammatory and
immune reactions [28-30]. In this study, we report for the
first time that an increase of serum Hp concentration is
observed in patients with cGVHD after allo-HCT. The
quantitative changes of serum Hp, as well as the well
known acute-phase reactants found in this study, such as
apolipoproteins A-IV, complement C4 and serum amy-
loid A thus might reflect changes in these proteins as man-
ifestation of their roles in the pathophysiologic
development and propagation of cGVHD or, alterna-
tively, simply a nonspecific manifestation of an inflam-
matory state. Other investigators have described results
that differ from the data reported here in terms of some
acute phase reactants such as apolipoproteins in the set-
ting of GVHD [31]. However, these data were derived
from patients undergoing cord blood transplantation in
contrast to our data set which is derived from patients
receiving only adult derived hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation. Additionally, the samples were collected
within the first 100 days of transplant, before cGVHD
could have developed in the report of Harvey, et al.
Finally, the subtype of apolipoprotein measured differed
from our study. Hp levels may increase in response to var-
ious stimuli, a further well designed study with more cases
included would be necessary for ruling out the Hp
changes secondary to transplantation-related infection,
lung injury, and other possible complications post-trans-

plant. Additionally, haptoglobin levels may be signifi-
cantly changed in patients experiencing GVHD associated
microangiopathy [32]. Although, no patient in our data
set met criteria for transplant associated microangiopathy,
this represents a well described GVHD associated clinical
syndrome and will need to be closely evaluated in future
studies concerning the association of haptoglobin and
cGVHD.
Hp is characterized by molecular heterogeneity with three
major phenotypes: Hp 1-1, Hp 2-2, and the heterozygous
Hp 2-1 [33-35]. Hp is synthesized as a single polypeptide
chain and is proteolytically cleaved to a short α-chain and
a long β-chain that remains connected through a disulfide
bond. Although Hp is found in serum of all mammals,
this polymorphism exists only in humans [36,37]. These
Hp phenotypes have different biologic activities, which
include a stronger anti-oxidation, hemoglobin banding
and anti-·OH production activities derived from Hp 1-1
and otherwise a stronger activity of macrophage activation
for Hp 2-2 [23,27,36,37]. The functional differences
between Hp phenotypes may play a role in determining
the severity and extent of myocardial damage in the set-
ting of myocardial infarction; Hp 2-2 is considered an
independent predictor of myocardial infarction [38,39].
The Hp 1-1 phenotype was reported to be protective in the
setting of two critical vascular complications of diabetes
mellitus: diabetic nephropathy and restenosis after percu-
taneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [40]. In addi-
tion, Hp 2-2 was reported to be overrepresented in
autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and
systemic lupus erythematosus [41,42]. In our small case
study, 43.8% of patients with cGVHD had an Hp 2-2 phe-
notype, higher than the normal donor group (Hp 2-2
18.7%). In addition, no Hp 2-2 type was found in the 9
patients with no clinical cGVHD presentation after allo-
HCT (Table 4). Based on our preliminary results and the
characteristics of the lower anti-oxidation activity and
higher potential of APC cell activation by Hp 2-2, we may
suspect that the patients with Hp 2-2 phenotype might
have more genetic susceptibility or tendency for cGVHD
development than the patients with Hp 1-1 or 2-1 type. To
further confirm this hypothesis, a prospective analysis of
correlations of Hp phenotype and the subsequent devel-
opment of cGVHD is now being conducted.
In conclusion, we found that an increase in Hp expression
is associated with cGVHD development. Further, the Hp
2-2 phenotype is present in patients who develop cGVHD
more commonly than in those who do not develop this
immunologic complication after allo-HCT. These findings
might establish Hp as a valuable protein candidate for
early cGVHD prediction and diagnosis. Several recently
reported studies have utilized proteomic profiling in the
development of predictive models of aGVHD [20-22].
Optimally, further studies utilizing proteomic profiling in
patients with cGVHD will eventually lead to predictive
models as well. Finally, further studies involving many
more patients regarding the possible effects of Hp on T
cell function during cGVHD are highly desirable.
