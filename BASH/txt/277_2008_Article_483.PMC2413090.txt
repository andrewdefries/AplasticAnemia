Abstract Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a
group of bone marrow diseases characterized by profound
heterogeneity in morphologic presentation, clinical course,
and cytogenetic features. Roughly 50% of patients display
clonal chromosome abnormalities. In several multicentric
studies, the karyotype turned out to be one of the most
important prognostic parameters and was incorporated into
statistical models aiming for a better prediction of the
individual prognosis like the International Prognostic
Scoring System. However, due to the profound cytogenetic
heterogeneity, the impact of many rare abnormalities as
well as combinations of anomalies occurring in a substantial
portion of patients with MDS is still unknown and can only
be delineated on the basis of large international multicentric
cooperations. Recently, the German–Austrian MDS Study
Group presented cytogenetic findings in 2,072 patients with
MDS, which serve as a basis for the characterization of the
cytogenetic subgroups discussed in this article. The avail-
ability of new therapeutic options for low- and high-risk
MDS targeted against distinct entities characterized by
specific chromosome abnormalities, like 5q-deletions,
monosomy 7, and complex abnormalities underlines the
important role of cytogenetics for the clinical management of
MDS. This article thus focuses on the clinical and prognostic
relevance, the molecular background, and therapeutic per-
spectives in these three cytogenetic subgroups.

Introduction
The profound heterogenetity of myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS) is well-known from morphological and clinical
studies, which finally lead to the establishment of classifi-
cation, and prognostic scoring systems. It is becoming
increasingly obvious that this heterogeneity also manifests
itself against the background of genetic heterogeneity of
MDS. In sharp contrast to the situation in chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) where one single cytogenetic abnormality,
the translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), is the genetic hallmark
of the disease, there is an enormous variability of
cytogenetic abnormalities in MDS hampering not only the
prognostic classification but also the delineation of the
molecular background of cytogenetic aberrations in MDS.
As an example in our recent multicentric cytogenetic
analysis of patients with MDS, we observed 684 different
types of chromosome abnormalities in a cohort of 1,080
patients with MDS and an abnormal karyotype [1].
The cytogenetic profile of MDS
In general, MDS show a characteristic genetic profile with
an overweighing of unbalanced abnormalities. Most fre-
quently, a loss of genetic material in the form of deletions
and monosomies can be observed. A gain of genetic
material with the appearance of total or partial trisomies is
less frequent. Loss or gain of genetic material can also be
the result of unbalanced translocations, which are frequently
observed in MDS with multiple abnormalities. Taken
together, it is thus obvious to assume that a prime molecular
mechanism in MDS is the loss or inactivation of tumor
suppressor genes, while the activation of oncogenes seems to
be less relevant in myelodysplasia.

In contrast to AML, balanced structural abnormalities
like translocations and inversions are rare in MDS. Due to
the profound genetic heterogeneity, the knowledge about
distinct cytogenetic alterations was mainly restricted to the
most frequent abnormalities (−5/5q−, −7/7q−, +8, 20q−, and
−Y), although, in MDS, rare chromosome abnormalities are
present in a substantial portion of patients. In a recent
analysis of the German–Austrian MDS Study Group, 59%
of all 2,370 abnormalities observed in 1,080 patients with
MDS where rare; that is, they occurred with a frequency of
less than 2% [1]. In this situation, prognostic knowledge can
only be deepened by large-scale multicentric studies with a
high enough number of abnormal cases with follow-up data.
This development was initiated by the International MDS
Risk Assessment Working Group (IMRAW) ending up with
the establishment of the International Prognostic Scoring
System (IPSS), which was based upon the analysis of 816
patients with de novo MDS of whom 327 had abnormal
karyotypes [2]. A next step forward was the study of the
Spanish cooperative group with 500 abnormal cases [3]
followed by our German–Austrian dataset with 1,080
patients with chromosome abnormalities [1]. The situation
is furthermore complicated by the fact that chromosome
abnormalities in principle can occur in three different
conditions: as isolated abnormality, together with one
additional change, and as part of complex abnormalities
with at least two additional cytogenetic alterations. Table 1
shows the incidence of the 21 most frequent abnormalities
according to the number of accompanying alterations
occurring in our German–Austrian patient cohort.
Cytogenetic prognosis
The first large-scale cytogenetic studies in patients with
MDS encompassing more than 100 patients where pub-
lished more than 20 years ago [4–7]. In the following years,
the patients cohorts increased step by step from nearly 250
patients [8] to some 400 patients [9, 10]. In 1997,
Greenberg published a collaborative multicentric interna-
tional data set of more than 800 patients with de novo
MDS, which was the basis for the establishment of the
IPSS [2]. This database was further surmounted by the
analyses of the Spanish cooperative group with 968 patients
examined (Table 2), which represented the largest number
of patients with MDS karyotyped so far [3]. Recently, the
German–Austrian Study Group published their multicentric
analyses of more than 2,100 patients with MDS [1].
What has changed and what has been achieved during
these last 25 years of cytogenetic analyses in MDS? If
the aberration rate is considered, there is a gradual
increase in the portion of abnormal cases from under
40% in the most earlier studies to 50% in the more
recent analyses of Toyama, Solé, and Haase [1, 3, 10].
Although the composition of the patient cohorts may play a
role for the portion of clonal abnormalities in a given
collective, other factors like the improvement of culture
conditions possibly due to the use of recombinant myeloid
growth factors [11] might have contributed to the increase
in the aberration rate in cytogenetic studies. To date, an
aberration rate of 50% can be regarded as an international
standard.

Prognostic relevance of chromosome abnormalities
The prognostication of patients with MDS has become an
important means for the development of therapeutic strate-
gies based on more individualized risk assessment. Even in
the most recent prognostic scoring system, the World Health
Organization classification-based Prognostic Scoring Sys-
tem, cytogenetics play a decisive role [12]. In general, three
to four prognostic cytogenetic categories can be distin-
guished. In several multicentric investigations, cytogenetics
have been proven to be highly relevant independent
prognostic parameters ([2, 3, 13], see also Table 2).
Good prognosis
Even in the earliest study considered here, Knapp et al. [4]
described the prognostic relevance of cytogenetic findings
with a normal karyotype as favorable and complex
abnormalities as being associated with bad prognosis. The
good prognosis of a normal karyotype was confirmed by
nearly all other groups. Thus, in contrary to the situation in
AML where patients with a normal karyotype have an
intermediate outcome and prognosis is significantly influenced
by additional molecular alterations, in MDS, a normal
karyotype is undisputedly associated with good prognosis.
Further, well-established abnormalities defining good-risk
subgroups are deletions of 5q and 20q as well as loss of the
Y-chromosome, although the question whether this latter
abnormality is age related, or a real clonal marker is unsolved
as yet. The Spanish group identified further new cytogenetic
abnormalities with a good prognosis (12p− and 11q−) [3].
In the German–Austrian multicentric study, the follow-
ing abnormalities were associated with a favorable clinical
course with a median survival between more than 9 years
and 32 months: normal karyotype, t(1q), 5q−, t(7q), 9p−,
12q−, t(15q), t(17q), 20q−, +21, −21, −X, −Y. However,
prognosis was only favorable when not more than one
additional abnormality was present [1].
Intermediate prognosis
In most studies, patients with trisomy 8 displayed an
intermediate clinical course. Until the Spanish group
published their results on more than 980 patients, the
knowledge of cytogenetic findings with an intermediate
prognosis was very limited. In the IPSS, all abnormalities
neither belonging to the good-risk group (isolated 5q−,
20q−, and loss of Y-chromosome) nor to the bad risk cohort
(complex [greater than or equal to three abnormalities] or
any chromosome 7 abnormality) were designated to be of
intermediate prognosis not by availability of survival data
but by definition [2]. In their large Spanish dataset, Solé
et al. delineated new abnormalities associated with an
intermediate clinical course (3q abnormalities, trisomy 9,
11q translocations, and 17p deletions) [3]. The results of
White et al. [14] and Toyama et al. [10] who identified
−7/7q− and 12p− and trisomy 21, respectively, as abnor-
malities with an intermediate prognosis were not confirmed
by other groups. Recently, the multicentric database of
the German–Austrian MDS Study Group revealed several
infrequent abnormalities with an intermediate prognosis. A
median survival time of 23–26 months was observed in

patients with trisomy 8 and 11q− (called Intermediate-I). A
more worse prognosis with a median survival time between
20 and 14 months was found for 11q23 translocations,
chromosome 3q aberrations, trisomy 19, 7q deletions, and
complex abnormalities with three different chromosomal
alterations and monosomy 7 (called Intermediate-II) [15].
Poor prognosis
There is a great consensus in all publications on cytogenetic
prognosis in MDS that complex abnormalities characterize
a MDS subgroup with bad prognosis and a median survival
time significantly below 1 year, although the threshold at
which the number of abnormalities confers bad prognosis is
a matter of debate. While in most publications, the term
“complex” is used for three or more abnormalities, in the
Medical Research Council AML trials, bad prognosis was
assigned to cases with five or more abnormalities [16].
Recently, we clearly could show that, in patients with MDS,
median survival is significantly reduced only when more
than three abnormalities are present, reducing the median
survival from 17 months in cases with three abnormalities
to less than 9 months in cases with four or more anomalies
[1]. Besides complex changes, partial and total monosomy
7 was ranked to the cytogenetic findings with an unfavorable
clinical course [3, 5–7]. Within the IPSS, any chromosome
7 abnormality was counted to the bad prognostic findings
[2]. As mentioned above, in the German–Austrian dataset,
−7/7q− showed a significant better prognosis (14 and
19 months median survival time, respectively) as compared
to the complex abnormality group defined by four or more
chromosomal changes (8.7 months) and was thus attributed
to the intermediate-II group [15]. The findings of Toyama et
al. [10] who observed an unfavorable course in patients
with trisomy 8 or 20q deletions was not confirmed by any
other group. Solé et al. described a median survival of
under 12 months in ten patients with an isochromosome of
17q [3]. Since, in the German–Austrian dataset, this
abnormality was too infrequent for a statistically meaning-
ful analysis, the Spanish findings are convincing but still
need further confirmation.
Prognostic scoring
In the IPSS, three different cytogenetic subgroups were
established and weighted against bone marrow blast counts
and cytopenias by multivariate analysis [2]. Applying the
cytogenetic part of the IPSS to our German–Austrian
dataset, 59% of the patients had a good risk karyotype
(normal, isolated 5q−, 20q−, or loss of Y-chromosome)
with a median survival of 54 months, 19% of the collective
had an intermediate prognosis (neither good risk nor bad
risk cytogenetics) with a median survival of 31 months, and
22% displayed a dismal prognosis (any chromosome 7
anomaly, complex [≥3] changes) with a median survival of
11 months [1].
The application of the new cytogenetic findings derived
from the German–Austrian dataset allows the definition of
four different cytogenetic prognostic subgroups (Table 3 and
Fig. 1). The low-risk group covers 73% of patients with 14
cytogenetic categories and a median survival of 55 months,
the intermediate groups I and II (15.5% of patients) with
eight cytogenetic categories and a median survival of 29
(intermediate-I) and 15 months (intermediate-II), and the
high-risk group (11.5% of patients) with a median survival of
8 months [15]. In comparison to the IPSS, our new
cytogenetic prognostication splits the intermediate group
into two distinctly separate subgroups with significantly
different median survival. The bad-risk group is more strictly
defined with a lower median survival time (8 vs. 11 months).
While the IPSS assigned an intermediate risk by exclusion
and not by knowledge, our intermediate cytogenetic sub-
group was based exclusively on available survival data of
patients treated with supportive care only thus reflecting the
natural course of the disease. Taking into account only those
patients with a known prognosis (in IPSS only good- and
bad-risk patients), 81% of our patients could be categorized
by the IPSS in comparison to 93% by the German–Austrian
prognostic system.
A further element of the IPSS, the weighting of
cytogenetics in comparison to other relevant parameters
like the bone marrow blast counts, has become question-
able. According to the IPSS, 0 scoring points are attributed
to good-risk cytogenetics and blasts less than 5%, interme-
diate cytogenetics as well as 5–10% blasts get 0.5 scoring
points, and bad-risk cytogenetic findings are scored with
1.0. Eleven to 20% blasts are scored with 1.5 and 21–30%
blasts with 2.0 points. Thus, bad-risk cytogenetics with a
median survival of 11 months get less scoring points than
patients with 11–20% blasts and a median survival in our
cohort of 16.5 months. According to our observations, only
patients with 21–30% blasts (11.7 months median survival)
had a prognosis comparable to patients with bad-risk
cytogenetics. Thus in a revision of the IPSS the weight of
bad-risk cytogenetics has to be readjusted [17].
Delineation of the most relevant cytogenetic subgroups
5q−, monosomy 7, and complex abnormalities
5q deletions
Deletions within the long arm of chromosome 5 are the
most frequent cytogenetic changes in MDS accounting for
518 Ann Hematol (2008) 87:515–526
roughly 30% of abnormal cases [1, 2, 3]. The deletions can
have variable size; however, the common deleted region
always spans the chromosome band 5q31. Due to intensive
research during the last decade, our knowledge of the
molecular background of these abnormalities is increasing.
It is generally accepted that not the illegitimate fusion of

represents the relevant pathomechanism. There could be
two different deleted regions in 5q31. One that is located
more centromeric is possibly associated with bad prognosis,
complex abnormalities, and high-risk, as well as therapy-
related, MDS. A second area is located more telomeric in
the vicinity of band 5q32 and is supposed to be related to
the good-risk 5q− syndrome [18–21. Recently, it has been
convincingly shown by the means of sophisticated system-
atic knockout experiments on 41 candidate genes in the
critical 5q− region that the gene for a ribosomal subunit
protein, RPS41, seems to be a relevant gene in patients with
5q− syndrome on the basis of haploinsufficiency [22]. The
5q− syndrome has been first described by Van den Berghe
in 1974 [23]. It is cytogenetically characterized by an
isolated deletion of chromosome 5q. A female preponder-
ance is well documented. The clinical appearance is
characterized by a refractory macrocytic anemia, normal
or elevated platelets, and mild leukocytopenia. The clinical
course is mild and long lasting with a very low risk for
leukemic transformation. The bone marrow smears reveal
less than 5% blasts, while dysplasia of the erythroid and
granulocytic lineages usually are discrete or even absent.
Megakaryopoesis shows profound and characteristic dys-
plasias with either separated multiple nuclei, hypolobula-
tion, microkaryocytes, and most characteristically
monolobulated megakaryocytes with a round nucleus.
The prognosis of 5q deletions in MDS is generally
favorable if they are not part of complex abnormalities;
however, it is significantly modified by single additional
cytogenetic changes [1, 24]. Figure 2 shows the Kaplan–
Meier survival curves for patients treated with supportive
care only with isolated 5q−, 5q− plus one additional
abnormality, and 5q− as part of complex abnormalities
derived from the German–Austrian database [1].
It is evident that additional abnormalities negatively
influence survival in patients with 5q deletions. However,
due to cytogenetic heterogeneity, the additive prognostic
impact of distinct single additional abnormalities remains
obscure as yet (Table 4).
Over a long period, the therapeutic standard in patients
with noncomplex 5q deletions was supportive care only.
In clinical trials, retinoic acid turned out to be inefficient,
and low-dose cytarabine was more effective but led to a
pronounced increase in severe neutropenic infections [25].
A preferential response to other modern therapeutic
strategies like immunosuppression and suppression of
DNA methyltransferase or histone deacetylase was not
reported as yet. However, recently, List et al. reported a
remarkably high response rate to the immunomodulating
agent lenalidomide, which was especially pronounced in
MDS patients with 5q deletions. Nine out of 12 patients
with a 5q deletion displayed complete cytogenetic remis-
sions, and 10 out of 12 experienced an erythroid response
[26]. Thus, a new promising agent may target cell clones
in MDS bearing 5q deletions. These results could recently
be confirmed on the basis of a large muliticentric trial
[27].
Monosomy 7
Monosomy 7 is the second most frequent distinct chromo-
some abnormality in MDS occurring in some 25% of
abnormal cases. It can present as total or partial monosomy.
In the latter case, variable deletions of parts of the long arm
lead to loss of genetic material of different size. As yet, no
significant differences concerning the prognostic relevance
have been observed between total and partial monosomy 7.
In the German–Austrian dataset, 36% of monosomy 7 were
isolated ones, 14% displayed one additional abnormality,
and 50% occurred as part of complex abnormalities [1].
Comparable to the situation in 5q, also in 7q, at least two
and maybe more distinct regions of common deletions have
been identified: the band 7q22 and the more telomeric
regions 7q31–32 and 7q36. It is interesting to note that
interstitial as well as terminal deletions might be due to
cryptic unbalanced translocations. In single individuals,
more than one different deletion has been found in one and
the same patient, either within the same copy of chromo-
some 7 with retention of sequences between the deleted
regions or within different cell clones [28, 29]. These
observations clearly underline the regional genetic instabil-
ity of the long arm of chromosome 7, which makes this
region especially prone to deletions of different size and
localization as well as to structural abnormalities. On the
other hand, it can be assumed that there must be a cluster of
genes with tumor-suppressive features distributed over
several chromosome bands in 7q with the same or very
similar consequences when being inactivated by chromo-
somal abnormalities.
However, in contrast to some presumptions in the 5q
deletions, as yet, no prognostic differences have been
elaborated between different regions of deletions (reviewed
in [20]). Investigations of the molecular background of
monosomy 7 MDS are on the way. An association of this
cytogentic subgroup with RAS mutations, mutations of
AML1, and hypermethylation of p15INK4B have been
reported [30, 31]. In an analysis of gene expression profiles
in CD34+ cells from MDS patients with monosomy 7, a
malignant phenotype with highly proliferative potential was
found with an overexpression of HOX9A, PRAME, BMI-1,
PLAB, and the DNA repair gene BRCA2. Parallelly,
downregulation of the tumor suppressor gene p21, GATA2,
and MAP was observed [32]. Clinically, monosomy 7 is
characterized by a lower median age of the affected patients
as compared to 5q deletions, severe refractory cytopenias,
and a proneness to life-threatening infections. Predisposing
520 Ann Hematol (2008) 87:515–526
conditions recurrently observed in cases with monosomy 7
are antecedent aplastic anemia, Fanconi’s anemia, neurofi-
bromatosis type I, cyclic neutropenia, and long-term
treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-
CSF), as well as Schwachman’s syndrome. It is of special
interest that myeloid cells harboring monosomy 7 seem to
be preferentially responsive to a stimulation by myeloid
growth factors like G-CSF and granulocyte–macrophage
CSF in vitro [33, 34] as well as in vivo [35]. Although
being obvious, this phenomenon never was exploited
therapeutically for a targeted priming strategy for patients
with monosomy 7.
In extremely rare cases, for the so-called monosomy 7
syndromes, the abnormality has a familiar background. In a
substantial portion of patients, a mutagen exposition
(benzene, solvents, irradiation, or radio- and/or chemother-
apy) was documented.
In contrast to the situation in 5q deletions, in monosomy
7, additional abnormalities do not have such a profound
impact on outcome as seen in 5q deletions, since

monosomy 7 even as an isolated abnormality confers a
significantly bad prognosis. In our Austrian–German data-
set, median survival times were 14 months for the isolated
abnormality, 11 months for cases with one additional
change, and 8 months for monosomy 7 as part of complex
abnormalities (Fig. 3) [1].
Therapeutic options in the monosomy 7 subgroup are
unsatisfying as yet. If age and clinical condition are
adequate, patients should be treated with allogeneic stem
cell transplantation whenever possible. Conventional inten-
sive chemotherapy bears a high risk of early death and
nonresponse. Even if a complete remission can be achieved,
this frequently is of only short duration with a high risk of
early relapse. In a recent report on 34 patients with MDS or
AML treated with 5-azacytidine, the group of Mufti
observed a preferentially good response of MDS patients
with monosomy 7 to the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine.
In this trial, five of the seven (71%) complete responders
had isolated chromosome 7 abnormalities and achieved a
continuous complete remission (10 months follow-up) in
contrast to patients with other karyotype abnormalities like
trisomy 8 who relapsed within the first 6 months [36].
Supporting results have been recently published for the use
of decitabine by Lübbert et al. [37]. Future multicentric
therapy trials are needed to verify this observation in a
higher number of patients.
Complex abnormalities
According to the International System for Human Cyto-
genic Nomenclature criteria, complex chromomosome
abnormalities are defined by the simultaneous occurrence
of at least three independent abnormalities within one cell
clone [38]. This cytogenetic subtype is present in some
15% of all patients with MDS (roughly 30% of all
abnormal cases) and thus occurs in a frequency comparable
to 5q deletions [1–3]. Complex abnormalities may be the
result of a multistep process with sequential accumulation
of abnormalities, called karyotype evolution. In some cases,
karyotype evolution can be observed if repeated cytogenet-
ic analyses are performed, unraveling the stepwise accu-
mulation of secondary abnormalities with the starting point
of a primary abnormality. In a few patients, cytogenetic
analysis detects cell clones with primary and others with
primary and secondary and possibly further abnormalities at
one and the same time point. However, frequently, this
process cannot be proven in the individual patient who
presents with multiple chromosomal changes at first
diagnosis. In most of these cases, complexity is profound
with aberration numbers exceeding the threshold of three
by far. Frequently, in these cases, cell-to-cell variations
occur, and the chromosomal complement presents with a
chaotic, mutator-like shape resembling cytogenetics of solid

tumors and malignancies in chromosomal breakage syn-
dromes. Thus, it is conceivable that, in these cases, the
process leading to complex abnormalities and genetic
instability must proceed rapidly on the one hand and must
involve mechanisms like DNA repair and cell cycle control
comparable to the situation in DNA repair deficiency
syndromes. Recent results of gene expression analyses in
patients with MDS and complex chromosome abnormalities
support these assumptions and are considered below in
more detail [39]. In a substantial portion of patients with
complex abnormalities, an exposition to therapeutically
applied mutagens, like anthracyclines, topoisomerase II
inhibitors, alkylating agents, and/or irradiation, can be
traced in the medical history [40]. Within the subgroup of
patients with complex changes, a broad range of the
number of abnormalities with the majority of patients
displaying greater than or equal to five chromosomal
changes can be observed [39].
There is a strong association with unbalanced structural
abnormalities affecting most frequently chromosomes 5q
and 7q. Chromosomes less frequently involved in loss of
genetic material were chromosomes 3 (p- and q-arms), 12p,
13q, 16q, 17p, 18q, and 20q. Genomic gains were observed
for chromosome 8/8q, 11q, and 21q [41]. Mutations of p53
have been observed in up to 90% of patients with AML and
complex abnormalities [39]. Matrix comparative genomic
hybridization (CGH) analyses in patients with complex
abnormalities revealed an association of complex karyotype
changes with amplifications in the chromosomal regions
8q24, 9p24,,11q23, 12p13, 13q12, 20q11, and 2q1q22 [42].
Recently, characteristic profiles of complex abnormali-
ties in AML were delineated by gene expression analyses.
In this respect, a significant overexpression of RAD21, a
double-strand-break DNA repair enzyme, as well as over-
expression of other genes related to DNA-repair, apoptotic
mechanisms, and cell-cycle control (RAD1, RAD 9A,
RAD23B, RAD51AP1, NBS1, MSH6, SUMO1, and
PARP2) was observed [39].
Taken together, these data might help to understand
complex abnormalities as a maximum manifestation of
genetic instability by allowing cells with significant DNA
damages to circumvent physiologically protective apoptosis
and to escape cytotoxicity of chemotherapy by intensified
DNA repair. This model is also compatible with the high
extent of chemo-resistance of hematopoietic cells with
complex chromosome abnormalities, which is a well-
known and severe problem in the clinical management of
high-risk MDS. Further clinical associations are the high
median age of patients within this cytogenetic subgroup
[43] and, related to conventional intensive chemotherapy,
short remission durations and a high risk for early relapse
[44]. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the only curative
option for these patients, will only be feasible for a minority
of individuals with complex chromosomal changes due to
age-related multimorbidity and organ dysfunctions. New
therapeutic strategies targeting hypermethylation, deacety-
lation, and immunomodulation, which have proven their
tolerability also in aged patient populations, are now
available for the treatment of patients with high-risk
MDS. In this respect, two studies have to be mentioned.
Cytogenetic responses in a substantial portion of patients
with high-risk MDS have been observed in a multicentric
study of decitabine, a potent demethylating agent. Major
cytogenetic responses (MajCR) were observed in 38% of
50 patients. Remarkably, 10 out of 26 patients (38%) with
high-risk cytogenetics displayed a MajCR; five of them had
complex chromosome abnormalities. In the patients’ group
with MajCR, median survival time was 24 months as
compared to the significantly shorter median survival time
of 11 months in patients with persisting cytogenetic
aberrations [45]. These observations are further supported
by observations of our group. Within a cohort of 14 patients
with high-risk MDS, we recently observed hematologic and
cytogenetic responses to 5-azacytidine according to the
modified International Working Group criteria [46] in three
out of four patients with complex abnormalities [47].
Another new therapeutic mechanism, immunomodula-
tion, might be effective in cases with complex karyotypic
changes too. In this connection, a complete cytogenetic
response to the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide has
been reported in patients with high-risk MDS with complex
chromosome abnormalities harboring 5q deletions [48].
Further multicentric clinical trials are needed to confirm
these observations.
Conclusions
In contrast to CML where the bcr–abl fusion forms the
homogenous genetic basis of the disease [49], MDS show
a profound heterogeneity, not only on the morphologic
and clinical level but also on the genetic presentation.
Three cytogenetic subgroups with prognostic relevance
have been identified and were incorporated into prognos-
tic scoring by the IPSS. However, in the great majority of
cytogenetic changes, the prognostic relevance is still
obscure. Genetic heterogeneity in MDS leads to the
paradox situation that rare abnormalities can be observed
frequently [1] with the consequence that, for a relevant
portion of abnormalities, their prognostic impact is still
unknown. The only chance to overcome these short-
comings is to establish multicentric cooperations, which
are the goals of the German–Austrian MDS Study Group,
which is now cooperating with the MD Anderson Cancer
Centre as well as the IMRAW group [50–52]. New

therapeutic strategies targeting immunomodulation and
epigenetic changes proved to be of outstanding effective-
ness and tolerability in comparison to established thera-
pies not only for the low-risk 5q syndrome but also for
high-risk MDS with as yet deleterious cytogenetic alter-
ations like monosomy 7 and complex abnormalities.
However, what about the subgroup of nearly 50% of
patients presenting with a normal karyotype? New techni-
ques will help to further delineate the genetic background in
these cases. Thus, very recently, two groups published their
results of single nucleotide polymorphism analyses in MDS
[53, 54]. The group of Mufti performed high-resolution
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analyses in
119 low-risk MDS patients of whom 32% displayed clonal
chromosome abnormalities to search for cryptic chromo-
somal aberrations not detectable by chromosomal banding
analyses. They found uniparental disomy (UPD), a copy
number neutral loss of heterozygosity, in 46% of patients,
small deletions in 10%, and amplifications in 8% of the
cohort. The changes of copy numbers were acquired while
UPDs were constitutional. The former aberrations were
associated with a worsened outcome of the patients. The
authors speculated that the high frequency of UPD may be
indicative for a constitutional genomic instability in these
patients [53]. This could be a predisposing factor for MDS.
Maciejewski et al. applied 250 K SNP arrays to 94 patients
with MDS and observed SNP aberrations in 75% of
patients as compared to 59% clonal chromosomal abnor-
malities detected by metaphase analyses. Previously un-
known lesions were found in patients with a normal—as
well as in others with an abnormal—karyotype. In this
study, UPD occurred in 20% of the MDS patients [54].
New analytical tools like matrix CGH, microarray gene
expression analyses, proteomics, and methylation profiling
will add substantially to the understanding of pathogenesis,
delineation of therapeutic targets, and individualization of
therapy in MDS.
Taken together cytogenetics is still the gold standard of
genetic diagnosis in MDS providing “labels” like 5q−,
monosomy 7, or complex abnormalities for disease entities
with a common biological behavior and clinical as well as
prognostic impact. In the future, scientific progress will
depend on the ability to combine established and newly
developed methods to gain a comprehensive understanding
of MDS, which will translate into an individualized and
highly effective and well-tolerable treatment for all patients
with MDS.
