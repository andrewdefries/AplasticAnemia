Abstract
Background: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by developmental
abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, and predisposition to cancer. The key FA protein FANCD2 crosstalks
with members of DNA damage and repair pathways that also play a role at telomeres. Therefore, we investigated
whether FANCD2 has a similar involvement at telomeres.
Results: We reveal that FANCD2 may perform a novel function separate to the FANCD2/BRCA pathway. This
function includes FANCD2 interaction with one of the telomere components, the PARP family member tankyrase-1.
Moreover, FANCD2 inhibits tankyrase-1 activity in vitro. In turn, FANCD2 deficiency increases the polyADP-
ribosylation of telomere binding factor TRF1.
Conclusions: FANCD2 binding and inhibiting tankyrase-1PARsylation at telomeres may provide an additional step
within the FA pathway for the regulation of genomic integrity.
Background
Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare recessive disorder asso-
ciated with chromosomal fragility, aplastic anemia, con-
genital abnormalities and a predisposition to cancer
[1,2]. Cells from FA patients exhibit hypersensitivity to
DNA cross-linking agents suggesting the role of FA pro-
teins in the repair of damaged DNA [3,4]. Currently, at
least 14 FA genes are known to exist, each of them
representing a different FA subtype [5-7]. Although they
have very few similarities, the encoded FA proteins
cooperate in a common FA/BRCA pathway by forming
several complexes, where the activation of a key FA pro-
tein FANCD2 (and FANCI) seems to orchestrate the
cascade of events in response to DNA damage [8,9].
FA proteins crosstalk with several proteins involved in
both DNA damage response and telomere regulation
[10-13]. Telomeres, the ends of chromosomes, consist
of TTAGGG tandem repeats (in mammals) forming a
T-loop structure and a 3’ G-rich single-stranded over-
hang that invades the telomeric tracts forming a D loop
[14-18]. In most human somatic cells telomeres undergo
shortening with each cycle of cell division due to what is
known as the “end-replication problem” [19,20]. To pre-
vent such shortening, a specialized enzyme called telo-
merase serves to maintain telomere length [21]. In
normally dividing somatic cells telomerase is insuffi-
ciently active to compensate for telomere shortening
and telomeres undergo attrition with each round of cell
division. In turn, telomeres in cancer cells are main-
tained either by the activation of telomerase or by the
homologous recombination mechanism known as alter-
native lengthening of telomeres (ALT) [22-24].
Telomeres are capped by a complex of proteins called
shelterin, which contains TRF1, TRF2, POT1 and asso-
ciated proteins including TIN2, TPP1, Rap1 and poly-
(ADP-ribose)-polymerase enzymes tankyrase 1 and 2
(TNKS1/2) [23,25]. TIN2 negatively regulates telomere
length by changing the telomeric DNA structure, stabiliz-
ing the T-loop and possibly limiting DNA accessibility to
telomerase [26]. Conversely, TNKS1 positively regulates
telomere length by the polyADP-ribosylation (PARsylation)

of TRF1 thus preventing TRF1 from binding to telomeres
[26,27]. Similar regulation occurs through the communica-
tion of TRF1 and POT1 [28,29]. The fact that (i) many tel-
omere-localized and FA proteins were found among DNA
repair proteins [30,31]; (ii) FANCD2 was shown to bind
Holliday junction DNA, an intermediate of homologous
recombination and stalled replication forks [32]; and
(iii) FA proteins are involved in the ALT mechanism of tel-
omere maintenance [33,34] prompted us to test for the pos-
sible engagement of FANCD2 in telomeres of normal cells.
Here we demonstrate that FANCD2 interacts both
with telomeric DNA and TNKS1 in vitro. Moreover,
FANCD2 inhibits TNKS1 PARsylation activity and
TNKS1-mediated TRF1 PARsylation. Such a novel func-
tion of FANCD2 may provide an additional step for
maintaining genomic stability.
Results
FANCD2 binds to telomeric DNA in vitro
We attempted to find a novel role for FANCD2 at telo-
meres and tested whether FANCD2 might bind to telo-
meric DNA sequence in vitro. The footprint analyses
demonstrate that FANCD2 has preferential binding to a
DNA template that includes tandem of 48 bp telomere
sequences (Figure 1A, lanes 5-9). This binding seems to be
telomere sequence-specific since adding myelin protein
(Figure 1A, lanes 3,4) or using a DNA template containing
nonTelDNA of the same length (Figure 1A, Lanes 10-12)
revealed no FANCD2-mediated protection against DNaseI.
These results were further validated by the electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA). We have shown that the
incubation of 40 bp telomere DNA with recombinant full
length FANCD2 protein resulted in the formation of a
protein-DNA complex on a native gel (Figure 1B). This
complex was completed by increasing amounts of cold
DNA, indicating the specificity of the telomere binding
(Figure 1B, lanes 1-4). We further verified the presence of
FANCD2 in DNA-protein complexes formed in EMSA by
direct Western blot analysis (Figure 2) and confirmed the
presence of FANCD2 in complexes formed with FANCD2
proficient (Figure 2B, lanes 1-3), but not with FANCD2
deficient cellular extracts (Figure 2B, lanes 4-6). The for-
mation of FANCD2-32P-TelDNA complexes in native
conditions was disrupted by the addition of anti-FANCD2
mAb probably due to the occlusion of FANCD2 and the
fact that it competed for binding with the telomere DNA
template (Figure 2B, lanes 2,3,5,6) but not with random
DNA sequence (data not shown). More importantly, the
mobility of 32P-TelDNA bound protein complexes on
autoradiogram corresponds to the mobility of the
FANCD2 signals as revealed by immunoblot analyses of
the same replica gel (Figure 2C). We also demonstrated
the presence of FANCD2 at telomeres in alternatively
lengthening telomere (ALT) cells but not in primary cells,
by performing ChIP assay (data not shown).
FANCD2 binds to TNKS1
To interpret the results of FANCD2 involvement at telo-
meres, we have screened some telomere-associated pro-
teins in HeLa cells by performing immunoprecipitation
experiments and detected that PARP-family member
tankyrase 1 (TNKS1), but not tankyrase 2 (TNKS2),
Figure 1 FANCD2 binds to telomere DNA sequence. (A)

32P-labeled 600 bp DNA containing either two 48 bp inserts of
tandem telomeric sequences (lanes 1-9) or nonTelDNA of the same
length (lanes 10-12) upon treatment with increased concentrations
of DNaseI (lanes 2-11), as described in Experimental procedures.
Myelin binding protein (MBP) was added as a non-FANCD2
negative control; (B) Mobility shift assay show that incubation of

FANCD2 protein resulted in protein-DNA complex formation (lane1)

amounts of cold DNA, indicating the specificity of the telomere
binding (lanes 2-4). Please note, that DNAse concentrations are
comparable in lanes 3,7,10 and 4,8,11.

binds to FANCD2 (Figure 3A). We then confirmed, by
means of an in vitro pull-down assay, that TNKS1 binds
to FANCD2. For that part, His-tagged TNKS1
was immobilized on a resin followed by consecutive
washing steps and binding with recombinant FANCD2
(Figure 3B) or heat-inactivated FANCD2 protein
(Figure 3C). Resin complexes were washed (lanes W1-3)
and eluted several times (Figure 3B, lanes E1-E5). Frac-
tions of equal volumes were loaded onto SDS PAGE
followed by Western blot analyses with anti-FANCD2.
Almost 84% of FANCD2 protein (vs. 9% for heat-inacti-
vated FANCD2) was retained with immobilized TNKS1
pellets, as calculated by comparing densitometry signals
from the input to those revealed from elution fractions.
The presence of single- and double-stranded telomeric
and nontelomeric DNA oligonucleotides did not signifi-
cantly affect this interaction (data not shown).
FANCD2 inhibits TNKS1 and TRF1 PARsylation
Using TNKS1 autoPARsylates [28], we then performed an
in vitro PARP assay in the presence or absence of
FANCD2. Interestingly, we observed the FANCD2-
dependent inhibition of TNKS1 autoPARsylation
(Figure 4A, lanes 5-7, upper panel). A similar effect was
observed when using the PARP inhibitor 3AB (lane 4). As
a control, we showed that neither myelin (lanes 2,3) or
heat-inactivated FANCD2 protein (lanes 8,9) affected
TNKS1 autoPARsylation. Similarly, we recognized low
levels of PARsylation in TNKS1 immunocomplexes
obtained after the immunoprecipitation of FANCD2-
deficient PD20 cell lysates as compared with the lysates
from the PD20 cells corrected with non-ubiquitinable
mutant (K561R) or wild-type FANCD2(data not shown)
suggesting that FANCD2-TNKS1 interaction and inhibi-
tion of TNKS1 autoPARsylation is not dependent on
FANCD2 monoubiquitinylation.
Since the main known cellular function of TNKS1 is
PARsylation of the telomere repeat binding factor TRF1
that results in detaching TRF1 from telomere complexes
[26,27], we performed an in vitro TRF1/TNKS1 PARP
assay in the presence of recombinant FANCD2. Similar
to the above data, we observed the FANCD2-dependent
inhibition of TRF1 PARsylation (Figure 4B). The pre-
sence of double-stranded telomeric DNA only slightly
increased the inhibition of TRF1 PARsylation (data not
shown). Thus, our results suggest that FANCD2 inhibits
the autoPARsylation of TNKS1 and PARsylation of
TRF1 in vitro.
FANCD2 affects TRF1 binding to telomeric DNA
Previous results showed that the ADP-ribosylation of
TRF1 by TNKS1 releases TRF1 from telomeres and pro-
motes telomere elongation [27]. PARsylated TRF1 dissoci-
ates from telomeres and becomes degraded via the
proteasomal pathway [35]. Deprotected telomeres become
better substrates for telomerase-mediated DNA extension
[36]. Since FANCD2 inhibits TNKS1 activity in vitro, we
tested whether TRF1 PARsylation or TNKS1-TRF1 com-
plex formation is affected by FANCD2. We performed
multiple immunoprecipitation studies and showed that the
formation of the TRF1-TNKS1 complex is impaired in
FANCD2-/- cells (Figure 5A,B). This could be due to
Figure 2 Binding of FANCD2 and TelDNA. (A) Experimental scheme showing specific binding of recombinant FANCD2 protein from cell
extracts with TelDNA oligoduplexes. Duplex oligonucleotides containing TelDNA sequence were [32P]-end labeled and incubated with 100 μg of
PD20 or PD20cor cell extracts. Complexes were separated and either subjected to autoradiography (B) or transferred to nitrocellulose for Western
blot analysis with anti-FANCD2 antibody (C). The position of specific complexes formed with 32P-TelDNA and proteins from FANCD2-/- (PD20) or
FANCD2-/- corrected (PD20cor) cell extracts separated on native gel matches the FANCD2 signals from the corresponding immunoblot. These
specific complexes are not seen in PD20 samples.

inhibition of the TNKS1-dependent degradation of TRF1.
In order to test these hypotheses, we immunoprecipitated
TRF1 in the above cell lysates and probed the correspond-
ing immunoblot with anti-PAR antibodies. We recognized
that in immunopellets obtained from PD20 (FANCD2-/-)
cell extracts, TRF1 is more PARsylated when compared to
PD20 corrected cells, suggesting that the presence of
FANCD2 impairs TRF1 PARsylation (Figure 5D).
Since both the FANCD2-mediated inhibition of
TNKS1 and TRF1 PARsylation may disturb TRF1 bind-
ing to telomeres, we hypothesized that FANCD2 defi-
cient cells might have altered telomere structure, length
or predisposition to recombination. Although telomere
length was not affected by FANCD2 deficiency as mea-
sured by Southern blot (additional file 1), Q-FISH (addi-
tional file 2), or Flow-FISH (additional file 3) analyses,
we observed telomeric extrachromosomal circular struc-
tures (ECS) in PD20 cells, but not in the corrected
counterparts, by performing 2D Southern blot with a
telomeric probe (Figure 6). We then attempted to com-
pare telomere recombination in these cells and analyzed
telomeric sister chromatid exchanges (T-SCE) using the
CO-FISH[0] technique with double color telomeric PNA
probes in PD20, PD20 corrected, primary FA-D2 and
corrected cells. We did not find any statistically signifi-
cant differences (additional file 4) in the amount of
T-SCE between FANCD2 deficient or corrected cells
indicating that the occurrence of ECS is unrelated to
telomeric recombination between sister chromatids.
Discussion
While normal FANCD2 activity is evident for maintain-
ing living functions of any cell, it is yet unclear whether
the key FA protein FANCD2 may possess biochemical
properties other than crosstalk with the FA members
upon resolving stalled replication forks. Our current
study suggests that FANCD2 may serve a separate role,
separate to FA-complex-mediated FANCD2/FANCI
monoubiquitinylation. This role includes the inhibition
of tankyrase 1-dependent TRF1 PARsylation which, in
turn, protects telomeric DNA. We suggest that under
normal conditions, FANCD2 safeguards genomic integ-
rity both by inhibiting TNKS1-mediated TRF1 PARsyla-
tion and by protecting telomeric DNA through TRF1.
TRF1 binding to telomeric DNA is essential for telo-
mere function, whereas PARsylation of TRF1 reduces
TRF1 affinity for telomeric DNA.
Recent studies showed that overexpression of TNKS1 in
normal human cells results in the downregulation of
TRF1, but has no effect on telomere length [37]. In addi-
tion, inhibition of TRF1 in normal human (IMR90) cells
using TRF1-dominant negative allele had no effect on telo-
mere length [31]. It was reported previously that the
knockdown of FANCD2 rapidly causes telomere dysfunc-
tion in cells that rely on ALT mechanism [33]. Studies by
Fan et al. suggest telomeric localization of FANCD2 in
ALT cells and that the transient depletion of FANCD2 or
FANCA results in a loss of detectable telomeres in ALT,
but not in telomerase-positive cells [34]. Some previous
works on telomerase-mediated telomere lengthening and
generation of ECS by telomere trimming upon inhibition
of TRF1 [38] incited us to examine possible changes in tel-
omere length in our model. However, measurements of
telomere length in siRNA FANCD2 depleted primary
fibroblasts either using Southern blot analyses of genomic
DNA (additional file 1), Q-FISH analyses in cells’

recombinant (B) or with heat-inactivated FANCD2 (C). The beads
were washed with TNE buffer (fractions W1-3) followed by several
elution steps (E1-5). Corresponding aliquots from each step (1/4
volume each) were subjected to Western blot analyses followed by
probing with anti-FANCD2 antibodies. Densitometric measurement
of the Western blot signals was performed by TotaLab2.0 software
and corresponding intensities from the all fractions versus input
were calculated as percentages of retained proteins.

metaphase (additional file 2), or Flow-FISH technique in
interphase (additional file 3) did not reveal any significant
changes. We can not disregard the fact that this short per-
iod of the transient depletion of FANCD2 by siRNA may
not be sufficient to detect alterations in telomere length.
Moreover, several other studies demonstrated telomere
attrition in the FA cells of an upstream FA subtype
[11,39-41]. For instance, telomere length was shown to be
shorter in 54 FA patient samples, compared to 51 controls
[39]. Similarly, a correlation between severe aplastic

membranes were either autoradiographed or probed with anti-FANCD2, anti-TNKS1 or anti-TRF1 antibodies.

anemia and the individual annual telomere-shortening rate
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was observed in 71
FA patients [42]. These facts may suggest that telomere
shortening may occur in some upstream FA subgroups as
a consequence of proliferative stress. The role of FANCD2
binding with TNKS1 and telomeric DNA is still quite
intriguing. On the one hand, such binding may affect telo-
mere maintenance by protecting telomeric DNA, in a
similar manner to the role of shelterin. On the other hand,
FANCD2 functions as a modulator of TNKS1 activity
which, in turn, may affect telomere maintenance.
Based on our experiments aimed at justifying the
direct link of FANCD2 to changes in telomere length
we may conclude that the presence of FANCD2 may
only affect telomere stability, but not the length. More-
over, our studies on a variety of human cells do not
exclude that FANCD2-dependent telomere alteration
also involves other aspects of FANCD2 function. Those
aspects could include the role of FANCD2 at replication
fork or the recently proposed link between FANCD2
and oxidative damage [43]. Consequently, the TRF1
removal described here can be one of the possible
effects of FANCD2 in telomere biology. Another inter-
pretation could be that FANCD2 stabilizes the t-loop
structure. Although our data do not demonstrate this
possibility, they are highly suggestive due to the follow-
ing reasons: (i) homologous recombination at t-loop
leads to an extra-chromosomal circle in the presence of
TRF2 deltaB [4]; (ii) FANCD2 binds Holliday junction,
which might contribute to t-loop stabilization [32,44],
(Giraud-Panis and Gilson, personal communication);

(iii) TRF1 contributes to t-loop formation [31]. Overall,
our finding of a novel interaction of FANCD2 may con-
tribute to understanding the differences between down-
stream FA-D2 versus upstream FA groups.
Conclusions
FANCD2 interacts both with telomeric DNA and with
telomeric protein TNKS1 in vitro. Moreover, FANCD2
inhibits TNKS1 autoPARsylation and TNKS1-dependent
TRF1 PARsylation thus affecting stability but not the
length of telomeres. This novel interaction of FANCD2
may provide an additional safeguard role to secure gen-
ome integrity.
Methods
Cell Lines and Treatment
The following cell lines were used in this study: human
transformed fibroblasts PD20 (FANCD2-/-); PD20 cor.
(PD20 retrovirally corrected with pMMp-FANCD2
cDNA); PD20 transduced with pMMp-FANCD2/K561R
MRC5; HeLa and primary fibroblasts (yoli) All the cell
lines were cultured as described previously [45]. Impor-
tantly, PD20 cells and variants are SV40 transformed
fibroblast and they are telomerase positive, as studied by
both RT-PCR of hTETR and with the TRAP assay. 3AB
PARP inhibitor (Sigma) was used at 3 mM concentra-
tion. Treatment with PARP inhibitor at this concentra-
tion did not significantly affect the cell cycle, as
measured by flow cytometry (data not shown). The cell
cycle was verified by flow cytometry and then analyzed
using BD PharMingen FACScan and CellQuest software
exactly as described earlier [45].
Preparation of Human Cell Lysates
Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in
the buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 420
mM KCl, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2,
0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and a 1:40
volume of protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture
(Sigma) on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 12,000
g for 10 min at 4°C, the supernatant was collected as
the total cell lysate. Separation on nuclear and cytoplas-
mic fractions has been performed as described in
Bogliolo et al. [45]. PBS-washed nuclear cell pellets were
further resuspended in buffer containing 5 mM MgCl2/
PBS, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mM KCl, 20% gly-
cerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mix-
ture (Sigma). The pellets were homogenized on ice by
sonication, clarified by centrifugation and stored at
-20°C for further experiments.
DNA Templates and Foot-Print analyses
Telomere DNA for footprint analysis was constructed
by modifying telomere sequences obtained from
Dr. Giraud-Panis [44] by cutting out the right-size frag-
ment from puc19-based pTelo2 and amplifying it by
PCR following digestion with TspRI, gel purification and
subsequent ligation with a non-telomeric coding 31-
mere DNA linker. After subcloning to pML20-42 plas-
mid, 600 bp DNA strands contains two telomere tan-
dem repeats of 48 bp each: (TTAGGG)8AACA
TCACGTACGTACGTACGTTCAAGCACT(TTAGGG)
8 and non-telomere linker. The complete templates
were gel purified and used for assay. To obtain the ran-
dom-sequence of non-telomeric DNA templates, two
single-stranded DNA fragments were synthesized and
subcloned to pML20-42. One DNA fragment was [32P]-
5’ end-labeled with T4 kinase. After annealing, the frag-
ments were extended with Klenow(exo-) DNA polymer-
ase and PCR amplified, followed by digestion with
TspRI restriction enzyme and purified. To obtain the
nonTelDNA for binding assays, same-length plasmid
having nonTelDNA random sequence was used. For in-
vitro pull-down assay, (TTAGGG)7 templates were
synthesized and used either as single stranded DNA or
annealed with corresponding sequences to obtain double
stranded DNA. Consequently, ssDNA and dsDNA oligo-
nucleotides of the same length with nonTelDNA
random sequences have been utilized as controls. Foot-
print analyses were performed as described in earlier
study [46].
Preparation of Proteins
Recombinant full-length wild-type FANCD2 was
expressed using baculovirus in Sf9 insect. The encoded
FA protein contained at the amino terminus a zz
domain, for purification on IgG-Sepharose. Tagged
genes were cloned into a modified pFastBac vector
(Invitrogen) and processed to generate recombinant
baculovirus and used to infect Sf9 cells following purifi-
cation and TEV cleavage procedure exactly as described
earlier [32]. TRF1 protein obtained from Dr. Chapman
(MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK)
was produced from hTRF1 expressed in E. coli following
necessary purification steps. Recombinant tankyrase pro-
tein obtained from Dr. Smith was purified from the
baculovirus-derived DH10Bac E. coli plasmid designed
as a NH2-terminally (His)6-tagged version of human
tankyrase in the expression vector pFastBac HTb (Gibco
BRL) following expression in SF9 insect cells exactly as
described before [28].
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
EMSA was performed as described in Promega protocol
(http://www.promega.com/guides/protein.interactions_-
guide/chap7.pdf). Briefly, aliquots of FANCD2 recombi-
nant protein or cell extracts were incubated with the
DNA sequence that has been P32-labeled and the DNA:

protein complexes, with or without competitors (protein
or specific antibody) were run on a non-denaturing
polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the experi-
mental reaction was compared to a control reaction that
contains only the labeled DNA or to the signals of cor-
responding immunoblot done in parallel.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot
For Western blot procedure cell lysates were eluted by
boiling in SDS gel sample buffer and proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted onto nylon
membrane following incubation with corresponding
antibodies. Protein bands were visualized with anti-
rabbit or anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxi-
dase using the ECL kit (Amersham, Arlington Heights,
IL, USA).
In vitro binding and pull-down assay
For his pull-down assays, 5 ug of tankyrase 1 fusion pro-
tein was incubated for 1 h at 4°C with Co-sepharose
(Pharmacia) in TNE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.8],
1% Nonidet P-40 [NP-40], 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM
EDTA). Recombinant or heat inactivated (HI) FANCD2
(both at 5 ug) was added to the binding mixture either
alone or in the presence of single- or double-stranded
42 bp DNA oligonucleotides following incubation in
TNE buffer for 30 min at 4°C. The beads were washed
with TNE buffer 3 times and corresponding aliquots
were subjected to Western blot analyses as described
above (fractions W1-3). Elution was done with immida-
zole (0.01-0.5 M). Corresponding fractions (E1-5) were
collected and analysed by Western blot as above. For
measurement of protein retention, scanned Western
blots were analyzed by densitometry program (Tota-
lab2.0) and the percentage of retained proteins in elu-
tion fractions was calculated by comparing the signals
from input fractions (2.5 ug of each protein).
PARP assay
Modified PARP activity assays were done with baculo-
virus-derived TNKS1 essentially as described before
[28,47]. Shortly, (His)6-tagged version of human tankyr-
ase samples (3 ug) and/or FANCD2 (0, 0.5, 3 or 8 ug)
were incubated for 30 min at 25°C in PARP buffer 50 ul
of buffer containing 50 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 4 mM
MgCl2, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1.3. M [32P]
NAD+ (4 uCi). Reactions were stopped by addition of
20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Acid-insoluble proteins
were collected by centrifugation, rinsed in 5% TCA, sus-
pended in Laemmli loading buffer, and fractionated by
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4-20% SDS-
PAGE). Proteins were visualized by Western blotting
with corresponding antibodies and/or autoradiography
of the membranes. As controls, myeling or heat-
inactivated FANCD2 (obtained by boiling FANCD2
samples for 20 min) were used. PARP inhibitor 3AB was
added where needed.
Additional material
Additional file 1: Southern blot analyses of telomere length upon
FANCD2 depletion. (A) Primary fibroblasts (PR) were consecutively
depleted from FANCD2 by siRNA for 5 days (PR+siRNA) or treated with
scrambled RNA (PR+scRNA) and the telomere length was measured by
Southern Blot analyses probed with Telomere probe as described in the
manufacturer manual from Roche. Low (Tel Con Low), high (Tel Con
High) control telomeric DNAs (Roche) or DNA extracted from mouse
fibroblast (Tel Con M) or HeLa cells at 2 ug or 5 ug were applied
alongside with the PR probes. (B) Telomere length was measured by
computer program (Roche) as the mean of the maximum intensities.
Additional file 2: Q-FISH analyses of telomere length upon FANCD2
depletion. Human primary fibroblasts (control) were consecutively
depleted from FANCD2 by siRNA for 5 days (FANCD2 siRNA) or treated
with scrambled RNA (scRNA) and the telomere length was measured by
Q-FISH analyses as described in Slijepcevic [48]. Mann-Whitney test was
applied to interpret the significance of the data and corresponding P
values are depicted at the bottom of the figures.
Additional file 3: Flow-FISH analyses of telomere length upon
FANCD2 depletion. Human primary fibroblasts (control) were
consecutively depleted from FANCD2 by siRNA for 5 days (FANCD2
siRNA) or treated with scrambled RNA (scRNA) and the level of FANCD2
was tested either by Western blot (A) or by immunofluorescence (B,
green signals). Corresponding fractions were measured for telomere
length by Flow-FISH analyses as described in Baerlocher et al.[49].
Additional file 4: Telomere recombination in FANCD2 deficient cells.
FANCD2-/- or FANCD2-/- corrected transformed (left part) or primary
(right part) fibroblasts were assayed for telomeric sister chromatid
exchanges (T-SCE) and the relative number of T-SCE/chromosome was
were measured by CO-FISH[0] technique with double color telomeric
PNA probes followed by plotting on the diagram.
