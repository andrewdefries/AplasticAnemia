Background
Iron overload is a predictable and life-threatening complication in patients dependent on
the regular transfusion of RBCs. The aims of this study were to investigate the efficacy
and safety of deferiprone in a variety of pediatric hematologic and/or oncologic patients
with a high iron overload.
Methods
Seventeen patients (age: 1.1-20.4 years; median: 10.6 years) from 7 hospitals who were
treated with deferiprone from 2006 to 2009 were enrolled in this study. Medical records
of enrolled patients were reviewed retrospectively.
Results
Serum ferritin levels were 4,677.8±1,130.9 μg/L at baseline compared to 3,363.9±
1,149.7 μg/L at the end of deferiprone treatment (P=0.033). Only 1 patient developed
neutropenia as a complication.
Conclusion
Deferiprone treatment is relatively safe for pediatric patients suffering from various hema-
tologic and oncologic diseases that require RBC transfusions as part of treatment.
However, the potential development of critical complications such as agranulocytosis
and/or neutropenia remains a concern.

INTRODUCTION
Iron overload is a predictable and life-threatening compli-
cation in patients dependent on the regular transfusion of
RBCs. In the absence of effective iron chelation therapy,
chronic transfusions lead to iron accumulation in the liver,
various endocrine organs, and the heart [1]. Numerous studies
have reported that cardiac events due to iron overload in
the heart are the primary cause of death in these patients
[2-4]. Therefore, effective iron chelation to promote the
excretion of the excess iron from target organs is essential
to prevent the morbidity and mortality observed in patients
with transfusion-dependent hematologic and/or oncologic
disorders [5, 6].
Over the past decades, deferoxamine (Desferal) has been
shown to prolong survival; improve growth and sexual matu-
ration; and reduce hepatic, cardiac, and endocrine dysfunc-
tion in iron-overloaded patients [7]. Although deferoxamine
can effectively stabilize or reduce body iron load, compliance
with the demanding dose regimen can be an issue. Subcuta-
neous administration of this drug is frequently associated
with local irritation at the site of the deferoxamine infusion.
Moreover, deferoxamine has been associated with a variety
of dose-related toxicities such as visual and auditory neuro-
toxicity, growth retardation, and bone morbidities. Due to
these complications and the route of administration, many
patients are noncompliant with deferoxamine therapy and
therefore fail to achieve adequate iron chelation [1, 8-11].
Deferiprone (Ferriprox) is an iron-chelating agent in oral
tablet form whose efficacy has been shown to be equivalent
to that of deferoxamine [12-16]. In this study, we investigated
the efficacy and safety of deferiprone in a variety of pediatric

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Seventeen patients (6 boys and 11 girls; age: 1.1-20.4 years;
median: 10.6 years) from 7 hospitals who were treated with
deferiprone from January 2006 to September 2009 were en-
rolled in this study. All patients received deferiprone as
the first iron-chelating agent. The median dose of deferiprone
was 25 mg/kg (range: 20-40 mg/kg). Seven patients were
diagnosed with oncologic diseases and 10 with hematologic
diseases. Among the oncologic patients, 5 were diagnosed
with neuroblastoma and 2 were diagnosed with acute mye-
loid leukemia (AML). Hematologic disorders included severe
aplastic anemia (SAA; 5 patients) hemolytic anemia (2 pa-
tients), congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (1 patient), pure
red cell aplasia (1 patient), and myelodysplastic syndrome
or refractory anemia (1 patient). The time period between
diagnosis and the start of deferiprone treatment ranged from
0.7 to 20.3 years (median: 3.6 years). The median treatment
duration of this study was 11.4 months (range: 1.4-39.6
months). All patients had received RBC transfusions (3-330
units; median: 48 units) for a median of 3 years (range:
1-13 years) (Table 1).
Patient data were collected from 7 hospitals in Korea in
a retrospective manner, and the participating institutions
were approved for inclusion in this study by the institutional
review board of each hospital. Data collected for each patient
consisted of the following: complete blood count (CBC);
ferritin, serum creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels; concomitantly
used drugs; and complications occurring between the start
and end of deferiprone use. Toxicities were evaluated using
common toxicity criteria (CTC; version 3.0). Cardiac evalua-
tion was limited to patients with a history of the symptoms
of heart failure and/or arrhythmia. In the present study,
however, no cardiac symptoms were reported. To evaluate
the efficacy and safety of deferiprone treatment, biochemical
parameters such as serum ferritin and liver enzymes were
analyzed using the Student t-test. All parameters are presented
as mean±standard error (SE). P-values less than 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Serum ferritin levels were 4,677.8±1,130.9 μg/L at baseline
compared to 3,363.9±1,149.7 μg/L at the end of deferiprone
treatment (P=0.033; Fig. 1). Other hematologic parameters
such as hemoglobin, white blood cell (WBC) count, and
platelet count showed no significant changes (Table 2).

Biochemical parameters for liver toxicity (AST and ALT)
showed some diminution at the end of treatment but did
not reach the level of statistical significance. Serum creatinine
levels showed a slight increase at the end of deferiprone
use, but levels were below normal both during and after
the deferiprone treatment period (Table 2).
One patient experienced a mild degree of leucopenia (WBC
count=1,870/μL; neutrophil count ＞1,000/μL), and medi-
cation was stopped immediately. The patient, a diabetic who
had used insulin during the study period, received defer-
iprone 30 mg/kg for 9 months, followed by an increase in
drug dose to 45 mg/kg. Seven months after the dose of defer-
iprone was increased, the patient’s CBC indicated leucopenia.
After cessation of the drug, the patient’s WBC count gradu-
ally normalized.
DISCUSSION
In this study, serum ferritin levels declined significantly
from baseline to end of treatment course (4,677.8±1,130.9
μg/L vs. 3,363.9±1,149.7 μg/L; P=0.033; Fig. 1). Only 1 patient
stopped taking medication owing to complications. This is
similar to the results of previous studies in which deferiprone
treatment prevented the progression of iron overload in
transfusion-dependent patients, as demonstrated by the se-
quential assessments of serum ferritin concentrations [17-19].
In addition, the efficacy of deferiprone has been shown to
be equivalent to that of deferoxamine in some studies [12-16].
While some adverse events were expected in the present
study, complications occurred in only 1 patient (5.9%). No
liver enzyme elevation or agranulocytosis (severe neu-
tropenia, defined as an absolute neutrophil count [ANC]
＜500/μL) was reported; however, 1 case of neutropenia
(defined as ANC ＞500/μL but ＜1,500/μL) was identified.
Serum creatinine concentrations increased significantly;
however, the levels of serum creatinine at the end of the
study were in the clinically normal range (0.7±0.1 mg/dL).
In a large, multicenter, long-term study of deferiprone treat-
ment, the incidence of agranulocytosis was 1% [20]. This
corresponds to a rate of 0.4 episodes per 100 patient-years
of therapy. In the present study, agranulocytosis did not
develop because of the small number of patients and the
short study period (22.9 patient-years; data not shown).
However, the overall incidence of neutropenia corresponds
to a rate of 2.5 per 100 patient-years of exposure [20]. This
incidence explains the results of the present study. Although
the mechanism of neutropenia development may differ from
the mechanism that results in agranulocytosis, thalassemia
patients not treated with deferiprone are known to exhibit
transient drops in the neutrophil count to a level defined
as neutropenia [21]. In some studies, deferoxamine-treated
patients experienced at least 1 episode of neutropenia, and
these episodes are likely to be related to overactivity of
the spleen, a condition that is often present in thalassemia
patients [20, 22, 23].
The limitations of this study were the small number of
patients, short period of follow-up time, and the hetero-
genous disease group. Seven patients had a malignant disease
such as neuroblastoma and AML. Most studies on iron-chelat-
ing agents applied these agents to targeted hematologic dis-
orders such as thalassemia. However, results of the present
study show the effectiveness of deferiprone in pediatric pa-
tients with malignant or benign hematologic disease for
which transfusion is needed during the course of treatment.
In conclusion, deferiprone treatment is relatively safe for
pediatric patients suffering from various hematologic and
oncologic diseases for which RBC transfusion is needed dur-
ing treatment. However, critical complications such as neu-
tropenia remain a concern.
