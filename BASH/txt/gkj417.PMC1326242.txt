ABSTRACT
Telomerase is essential to maintain telomere length
in most eukaryotes. Other functions for telomerase
have been proposed but molecular mechanisms
remain unclear. We studied Caenorhabditis elegans
with a mutation in the trt-1 telomerase reverse tran-
scriptase gene. Mutant animals showed a progressive
decrease in brood size and typically failed to repro-
duce after five generations. Using PCR analysis to
measure the length of individual telomere repeat
tracks on the left arm of chromosome V we observed
that trt-1 mutants lost $125bp of telomeric DNA per
generation. Chromosome fusions involving complex
recombination reactions were observed in late gen-
erations. Strikingly, trt-1 mutant animals displayed a
high frequency of telomeres with many fewer repeats
than average. Such outlying short telomeres were not
observed in mrt-2 mutants displaying progressive
telomere loss very similar to trt-1 mutants. We specu-
late that, apart from maintaining the average telomere
length, telomerase is required to prevent or repair
sporadic telomere truncations that are unrelated to
the typical ‘end-replication’ problems.
INTRODUCTION
A minimum number of repeats are required at every chromo-
some end in order to form a proper telomere structure that
prevents activation of a DNA damage response (1,2). In order
to maintain telomere repeats most eukaryotes require the
enzyme telomerase, which minimally consists of a RNA tem-
plate and a reverse transcriptase. It has been proposed that
telomerase has functions other than telomere length mainte-
nance, such as telomere end protection and regulation of DNA
damage responses (1,3–6). However, details of the molecular
mechanisms involved in such functions are lacking.
Various model organisms have been used to study the role
of telomerase. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, null mutations in
any of the ﬁve genes, EST1, EST2, EST3, CDC13 and TLC1,
result in progressive telomere shortening followed by senes-
cence (7–11). Late generations of the telomerase-deﬁcient
est1D strain showed elevated mutation rates and frequent
chromosomal rearrangements and end-to-end fusions (12).
Telomerase null mutants in multicellular organisms also dis-
play progressive telomere shortening and genetic instability.
In the Arabidopsis telomerase mutant (AtTERTÀ/À
) develop-
mental abnormalities and chromosomal instability became
evident after ﬁve generations (13–15). Molecular character-
ization revealed that most fusions in AtTERTÀ/À
involve a
telomeric end and a subtelomeric end (15). In addition, Ku-
dependent non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) appears to be
the major mechanism by which these fusions form.
In mice, homozygous disruption in either the telomerase
RNA template gene (mTERC) or the reverse transcriptase
gene (mTERT) results in progressive telomere shortening
and chromosomal instability in late generations (16–19).
Recent studies have linked mutations in one allele of the
hTERC or hTERT gene to bone marrow failure in humans
(20–23). Of note, telomerase activity is typically readily
detectable in the cultured lymphocytes from such patients,
yet the telomere length in such cells is typically (very)
short. These observations indicate that even modest (e.g.
2-fold) reductions in telomerase levels are poorly tolerated
in human cells (24). Compared with the absence of a disease
phenotype in mice that are haplo-insufﬁcient for either
mTERC (25) or mTERT (26), the marrow failure in patients
with comparable genetic defects is remarkable. One possibility
is that telomerase in humans has a role outside telomere length
maintenance (6). Alternatively, the large differences in aver-
age telomere length between inbred mice ($50 kb) and man
($5 kb) could be important for these observed phenotypic

ies on the role of telomerase in multicellular organisms are
needed.
The putative reverse transcriptase component of
Caenorhabditis elegans telomerase is encoded by trt-1 (27).
Telomeric DNA in C.elegans consists of TTAGGC repeats
and has been shown to span between 4 and 9 kb in the
wild-type strain N2 (28). We have adapted previously
the PCR-based technique STELA (single telomere length
analysis) (29) to telomere length measurement in C.elegans
(30). Using STELA, we show here that besides progressive
telomere shortening and telomere fusions, disruption of telom-
erase in C.elegans leads to a high frequency of short outlying
telomeres, suggesting that telomerase is required to prevent or
repair large-scale truncations of telomeric DNA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains
Worms were handled as described by Brenner (31) but were
grown at room temperature (19–23
C) unless stated otherwise.
The strains used in this study included N2, glp-4(bn2ts) that
has been outcrossed to N2 10 times (KR4138 and KR4139),
and trt-1(ok410) that has been outcrossed to N2 for at least
10 times (KR4050). The deletion allele ok410 was generated
by Robert Barstead Laboratory (Oklahoma Medical Research
Foundation, OK) and characterized by the Vancouver Gene
Knockout Facility, which is part of the C.elegans Gene
Knockout Consortium (for more information of the allele
see www.wormbase.org).
Single telomere length analysis
Measurement of VL telomere length by STELA was carried
out as described in Cheung et al. (30). Brieﬂy, an oligo-
nucleotide was ﬁrst ligated to the 50
end of telomeres. PCR
was then carried out using a primer against the oligonucleotide
and a primer against a unique sequence in the subtelomeric
region of Chromosome VL, followed by Southern blotting
using a probe that hybridizes to the subtelomeric region.
Telomere length was calculated by subtracting 1.1 kb (the
distance between the primer recognition site in the subtelom-
eric region and the start of the telomeric sequence) from the
size of the band ampliﬁed.
Analysis of STELA data
From a gel ﬁle generated by PhosphorImager, intensity of
signals was measured (in 0.1 mm intervals) along a lane by
ImageQuant 5.0 software. Data were imported into Microsoft
Excel for size analysis. From a size marker lane, a plot of size
(kb) against distance (mm) was generated and ﬁtted by the
power function (y ¼ axb
), which works best for bands <5 kb.
The formula was then used to calculate the size, and 1.095 kb
was subtracted to obtain telomere length for each measured
intensity value. To calculate the rate of VL telomere shorten-
ing in trt-1 mutants, plots of intensity against telomere length
were generated for each generation in each line from
Figure 3. In most cases where a major cluster of bands
were ampliﬁed, telomere length for the generation was deter-
mined to be the peak of the plot. In cases where bands were
spread out, telomere length was arbitrarily determined to be
the middle of the spread. Telomere length determined this way
was plotted against generation and the plot was ﬁtted by linear
regression. The rate of VL telomere shortening is the slope
of the linear curve.
Characterization of telomere fusions
Genomic DNA was extracted from single worms using
phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol as described in Cheung
et al. (30), except that DNA pellet was resuspended in
10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.5), and used directly as template in
nested PCR. Primary PCR was carried out in a 20 ml reaction
containing half or the whole of the genomic DNA extracted
from a single worm, 1· PCR buffer IV (ABgene), 2 mM
MgCl2, 0.1 mM of primer 798 (50
-GGGATGCGCAGCTAAC-
TATAGGAC-30
), 0.3 mM of each dNTP (Amersham) and
1.5 U Extensor Hi-Fidelity PCR Enzyme Mix (ABgene).
Thermal cycling conditions were the following: initial dena-
turation at 94
C for 3 min, 25 cycles of 94
C for 20 s, 70
C
for 8 min, followed by ﬁnal elongation at 70
C for 10 min.
Primary PCR products (0.2 ml) were used as templates in
nested PCRs, which contained the same concentrations of buf-
fer, MgCl2, dNTPs and Enzyme Mix as in primary PCRs, with
0.1 mM of primer 797 (50
-AAATGACAGTACTTATGGGT-
TTCGTTC-30
). Thermal cycling conditions were the same as
in primary PCR, except that 30 cycles were carried out instead
of 25. PCR products were puriﬁed, A-tailed, and cloned into
pGEMÒ
-T Vector (Promega), which was then transformed
into DH5aÔ competent cells (Invitrogen). Inserts were
sequenced at the Nucleic Acid Protein Service Unit at the
University of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We analyzed the length of telomeric DNA at the left end of
chromosome V (VL) in C.elegans using STELA (30) in dif-
ferent generations of the wild-type strain N2. Marked ﬂuctua-
tions in telomere length over multiple generations were
observed (Figure 1A), consistent with the results generated
by Southern hybridization reported previously (32). Despite
these ﬂuctuations, VL telomeres were maintained within a
range of $1 kb in all generations examined (Figure 1A).
This range reﬂects the sum of telomere length heterogeneity
in all (ﬁve) individuals analyzed from each generation. To
examine variations in the distribution of telomere length
among individuals, a hermaphrodite parent and 10 of its pro-
geny were analyzed by STELA (Figure 1B). Individuals with
clearly distinct telomere length distribution were apparent
(progeny 3 and 9, Figure 1B). Hence, considerable telomere
length variation occurs within one generation and may explain
the telomere length ﬂuctuations shown in Figure 1A. Exam-
ination of the temperature sensitive mutant glp-4(bn2ts),
which becomes essentially germline-less when grown at the
restrictive temperature (33) suggested that the germline may
be an important source of the observed telomere length
diversity (Supplementary Figure S1).
The putative reverse transcriptase component of C.elegans
telomerase is encoded by trt-1 (27). The trt-1 allele ok410
carries a deletion spanning the region that encodes for
three of the seven conserved reverse transcriptase motifs as

by STELA at F1, F5, F9, F13 and F17. DNA was extracted from five reproductive-stage adult sampled at each of the generations. DNA was ligated to the telorette and
0.1 worm equivalent was used in each PCR. Marker lane is shown on the left and the corresponding telomere length is indicated on the right. Actual telomere length
was 1.1 kb shorter than the size of the PCR product because 1.1 kb of subtelomeric sequences were also amplified. (B) Telomere length heterogeneity in a clonal

numbers are indicated on top of each panel; the heterozygous parent is considered as Po. A number was assigned for each line (1–16) and it is shown at the top right

predicted by Malik et al. (27) (Figure S1). Sixteen lines of trt-1
were serially propagated until the line became sterile. For each
generation, the number of adult progeny was counted and the
parent was analyzed by STELA after all eggs were laid. In the
early generations, most adult worms appeared healthy,
although trt-1 had variably reduced progeny number (Supple-
mentary Table S1). In later generations, the worms became
sluggish and early death was frequent (data not shown). There-
fore, similar to telomerase mutants in other organisms (13,16),
trt-1 has decreased general ﬁtness. Consistent with TRT-1
being a component of telomerase, all 16 lines of trt-1 displayed
progressive shortening of telomeres (Figure 2). In most lines,
the VL telomere shortened by between 100 and 150 bp per
generation (Supplementary Table S2). With an estimation of
10–15 cell divisions per generation (34), we calculated that
C.elegans loses $10 bp of telomeric DNA per cell division.
Although this rate was measured from only one chromosome
end, results from different chromosome ends are expected to
be similar. This rate of telomere shortening is more similar to
S.cerevisiae ($4 bp per cell division) than to mammals (100–
150 bp per cell division) (10,35), suggesting that the process-
ing of telomeric ends after replication in C.elegans may be
more closely related to yeast than to mammals. In a number of
instances, VL telomere did not appear to shorten between
generations (e.g. F3 to F4 in line 6 and F2 to F3 in line 11;
Figure 2). It is possible that in those cases, rare longer
telomeres in the population of germ cells were inherited,
resulting in no apparent telomere shortening between those
generations.
Telomere length heterogeneity in trt-1 was studied by
STELA on individual progeny from a single parent
(Figure 3A–D). In contrast to wild-type (Figure 1B), telomere
length was highly uniform among trt-1 progeny (the two clus-
ters of bands in most worms shown in Figure 3A–D likely
represent the two alleles of VL), supporting the notion that
telomerase is involved in the generation of telomere length
diversity observed in wild-type animals (Figure S2). In
addition, trt-1 lacks the abundance of long telomeres seen
Figure 3. Short outlying telomeres are readily observed in the DNA from single trt-1 mutants but not in the DNA from five mrt-2 mutants. (A–D) Eight to sixteen
reproductive-stage individual progeny from four separate trt-1 parents were analyzed by STELA. Each lane represents a single worm. The two clusters of bands in
most worms likely represent the two alleles of VL. In order to maintain the strain, trt-1 has to be routinely outcrossed. The longer VL telomere could be derived from
the wild-type parent and the shorter VL telomere from the trt-1 parent. (E) DNA was extracted from five worms from the same mrt-2 parent in each of F2 (lane 1), F5
(lane 2) and F9 (lane 3) and subsequently used in STELA. A DNA equivalent of one worm was used as the template in each PCR.

in wild type. The lack of long telomeres in trt-1 is compatible
with telomerase being important in telomere elongation in
wild type. However, a high frequency of short outlying telom-
eres relative to wild type was also observed in trt-1 (compare
Figure 1B and Figure 3A–D). Although not present in every
individual, a ladder of short outlying bands was ampliﬁed in
most trt-1 animals. These short outliers were more apparent in
mutants with longer telomeres (compare Figure 3A and B with
100 Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 1
Figure 3C and D). Because telomerase adds telomeric repeats
to only a fraction of telomeres in each cell cycle (36), these
short telomeres could be explained if they escaped telomerase
elongation through all cellular divisions. However, trt-1 lost
on average between 100 and 150 bp per generation (Figure 2
and Figure S1), and the short outlying telomeres were almost
always more than a few hundred basepairs shorter than the
majority (Figure 3A–D). Therefore, the short outlier telomeres
were probably not generated by the typical loss predicted to
occur during telomere replication (37).
It is interesting to note that in mutants of mrt-2, which is a
highly conserved DNA damage checkpoint gene homologous
to S.cerevisiae RAD17 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe
rad1+
, telomeres are shortened at a similar rate as observed
in trt-1 ($125 bp per generation) (34), suggesting that telom-
ere shortening in mrt-2 could be caused by lack of elongation
by telomerase. Ahmed and Hodgkin (34) speculated that
MRT-2, in its role as a checkpoint protein, could recognize
telomeres as a form of DNA damage during replication, when
telomeres are expected to adapt an open structure, revealing a
structure that resembles a double-stranded break (1). MRT-2
could contribute to telomerase recruitment, possibly by coor-
dinating the temporal and spatial association of telomerase.
One major noticeable difference in telomere phenotype
between mrt-2 and trt-1 is the lack of short outlying telomeres
in mrt-2 (30). Figure 3E shows telomere length measured from
F2, F5 and F9 mrt-2 mutants. In each generation, DNA
extracted from ﬁve worms was used in STELA. While mrt-2
also displayed reduced telomere length heterogeneity as in
trt-1, an increased frequency of short outlying telomeres was
not observed even when telomere length was relatively long
(F2 in Figure 3E). Perhaps telomerase in mrt-2 is defective in
elongating telomeres after replication but still functions in an
mrt-2-independent manner to prevent rapid telomere loss.
End-to-end fusions have been observed in telomerase
mutants in different organisms (12,13,16,19). To study if
telomerase deﬁciency leads to telomere fusions in C.elegans,
single primer nested PCR was carried out. By including a
single primer that recognizes the VL subtelomeric region in
PCRs, we reasoned that only fusions between two VL telom-
eres would be ampliﬁed. In support of this notion, PCR prod-
ucts could indeed be detected in some trt-1 worms but not in
N2 (data not shown). Cloning and sequencing of eight of the
ampliﬁed products revealed different types of telomere
fusions: simple end-to-end fusions (category I), and more
complicated rearrangements that involved either insertion of
a sequence normally found in an internal VL chromosomal
location (category II) or duplication within the VL subtelom-
eric region (category III) (Figure 4). We note that simple
end-to-end fusions with the subtelomeric–telomeric and the
telomeric–telomeric conﬁgurations (Figure 4) could be under-
represented because PCR ampliﬁcation through long repeat
sequences is generally difﬁcult. Therefore, the relative fre-
quency of the different types of fusions could be skewed.
All eight clones characterized in this study display either
microhomology or insertion at the fusion junctions, similar
to the observations in Arabidopsis lacking telomerase (15).
Two characteristics of the fusions are noted. First, in all
eight fusions, at least one telomere end involved in the fusion
was truncated. Truncation occurred within the same 10 bp
fragment in ﬁve out of the eight clones (clones 1–3, 7 and
8). Second, in all four cases of category II fusions, the site
where the inserted internal VL fragment joined the telomeric
repeats of a VL end contained multiple imperfect telomeric
repeats. The imperfect telomeric repeats were always in the
same direction as the telomeric repeats to which they joined. A
correlation between the direction of the imperfect repeats and
the orientation of insertion is illustrated by clone 7. The entire
50 bp-inserted sequence in clone 7 was interspersed with
imperfect telomeric repeats. By inserting in an opposite
orientation as clones 4–6, the direction of the imperfect
repeats relative to the telomeric repeats was maintained.
We speculate that the complicated fusions were generated
by recombination, while the end-to-end fusions were likely
to have resulted from NHEJ.
In this study, we have demonstrated that mutation in telom-
erase leads to progressive telomere shortening, telomere
fusions, reduced telomere length heterogeneity and increased
frequency of short outlying telomeres. It appears that the
germline may be an important source of telomere length het-
erogeneity (Supplementary Figure S2). We have shown in this
study that trt-1 contributes to telomere length heterogeneity
both within an animal and within a clonal population: VL
telomere length distribution within an individual is narrower,
and variations among siblings are much smaller in trt-1
mutants (Figure 3A–D). Since signiﬁcant levels of expression
of trt-1 have only been observed in isolated oocytes,
reproductive-stage adults and certain stages of embryogenesis
(38,39), we propose that telomerase activity in the embryo and
in the germ cells is responsible for the observed telomere
length heterogeneity within individuals and within clonal
populations respectively. It is likely that telomere length

three categories. Category I consists of simple end-to-end fusions. White block arrow denotes the sequence between the inner primer and the beginning of telomeric
DNA (represented by the wiggly line). Hatched block arrow denotes sequence between the inner primer and the outer primer. The presence of microhomology or
insertion at the fusion junction (shown by an arrow head) is also indicated. In clone 3, 25 telomeric repeats were present at the fusion junction. Category II consists of
complicated rearrangements in which a fragment from an internal VL site (denoted by a black block arrow) was inserted between the two ends. In clone 4, the
black block arrow represents a 3.8 kb fragment found within the cosmid Y39D8B ($360 kb from the VL telomere). In clone 5, the black block arrow represents a
0.47 kb fragment found within the cosmid B0348 ($16 kb from the VL telomere). In clone 6, it represents a 0.73 kb fragment from cosmid B0348 that overlaps with
the 0.47kb fragment insertedin clone 5. The inserted fragments in clones4–6 all containedimperfect telomeric repeats around the regionwhere it joined the telomeric
repeats (represented by wiggly line). In clone 7, the black block arrow represents a 50 bp fragment found in the cosmid C39F7 (1.2 Mb from the VL telomere). This
fragment is interspersed with imperfect telomeric repeats. It was inserted in an opposite orientation as the other clones in this category. Category III consists of a clone
which involved complicated rearrangement of the VL subtelomeric sequence. Within the fragment between the inner primer and the beginning of telomeric DNA, a
172 bp sequence is replicated 2.5 times (indicated by the division of the block arrow into three parts in gradient)but the replicatescarry severalmismatches. Inclone 8,
a sequence(denotedby the small orange blockarrow) that overlapswithtwo of the replicateswas insertedbetween two chromosome ends,one of which was truncated
within the 10 bp fragment as in clones 1–3 in category I. Although only the nested primer was used in secondary PCRs, most clones (1–3, 7 and 8) were flanked by the
outer primer sequence and the nested primer sequence, indicating that the low concentration of the outer primer in the secondary PCRs was enough to prime
amplification with the more abundant nested primer.

heterogeneity in wild-type C.elegans results mostly from
direct elongation by telomerase. However, indirect mecha-
nism(s) may also play a role. It has been proposed that
telomere repeat addition by telomerase is required for recom-
binational repair of nicks in telomeric DNA by break-induced
replication (37). Recombination reactions could generate the
unusually long telomeres observed occasionally in wild-type
animals (e.g. progeny 3 in Figure 1B).
The generation of extremely short telomeres has been
inferred from the high frequency of fusions between induced
double-stranded breaks and short tracts of telomeric repeats in
S.cerevisiae telomerase mutants (40). In this study we have
provided direct evidence for the presence of such extremely
short telomeres in C.elegans in the absence of functional
telomerase. We previously described that in all of the wild-
type C.elegans strains characterized, occasional short outlying
telomeres, indicative of processes other than end-replication
losses and telomerase-mediated lengthening could be
observed (30). The model put forward initially by Lustig
and coworkers (41–43) to explain telomere rapid deletion in
rap1t
yeast mutants, and later by Wang et al. (44) to account
for the presence of T-loop-sized, telomeric repeat-containing
circular DNA induced by TRFDB
, involves intrachromatid
recombination at telomeres. Recently, it has been suggested
that sporadic telomere loss events could also result from
(oxidative) damage to telomeric DNA or from failure to
resolve higher order structures of G-rich DNA (37). Similar
processes could also generate the short outlying telomeres
observed in different strains of wild-type worms and in
human clonal ﬁbroblast cultures (29,30). In addition to gen-
erating heterogeneous telomere length, our data suggest that a
major function of telomerase could be related to the repair of
sporadic telomeric DNA loss events.
