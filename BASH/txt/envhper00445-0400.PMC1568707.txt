Possibilities of Detecting Health Effects by
Studies of Populations Exposed to
Chemicals from Waste Disposal Sites
by Patricia A. Buffler,* Martin Crane,* and Marcus M. Key*
Factors affecting the design of an epidemiologic study assessing possible health effects from chemical
waste disposal sites are reviewed. Such epidemiologic studies will most likely be prompted either by a
known release of chemicals into the environment around the site, or by an unusual disease cluster in a
population near the site. In the latter situation, a method for evaluating the health effects is needed, and
one possible approach is discussed. In the former situation, it may not be obvious what health outcomes
are relevant.
Reported associations between health effects and chemicals in humans were reviewed. Studies from the
occupational and environmental literature were classified by chemical and target organ affected and
presented in tabular form. No attempt was made to critically evaluate the quality of evidence for each
health effect, although bibliographic documentation was provided where possible. Episodes of chemical
contamination of food, drinking water and other media were also reviewed and presented in a separate
table.
The organ sites likely to be affected by toxic chemicals from waste disposal sites depend heavily on the
route of exposure and the dose that is received. Ingestion is the most frequently reported route of exposure
in episodes of environmental contamination. These have affected the hepatic, renal, hematopoietic, re-
productive, and central nervous systems. The type and severity of effects were dose-dependent. Direct skin
contact is important in the occupational environment where dermal and central nervous system effects
have been reported but seems less likely as a route of exposure for populations around waste disposal
sites. Inhalation, unless at relative high concentrations or as a result of fire, is unlikely to be important,
although hematopoietic, reproductive, and central nervous system effects have been reported in occupa-
tional studies.
General Considerations
Consideration of the potential human biologic or health
effects that might be detected among populations re-
siding near chemical waste disposal sites requires in-
formation on the toxicity of the materials disposed and
the conditions of exposure of human populations. The
issues related to consideration of the potential human
health effects will be briefly reviewed.
The design and conduct of an appropriate epidemio-
logic study requires documentation ofthe number, type,
and volume of chemicals disposed, the time period of
operation, and the particular chemicals and quantities
currently present. In the absence of such information
it is nearly impossible to determine either the necessity
for an epidemiologic study or the specific type of health
effects to be assessed.
Assuming that information on the type and amounts

ter at Houston, P.O. Box 20186, Houston, TX 77225.
of toxic materials is assembled, it is then important to
consider the potential for human exposure. What are
the most likely environmental pathways, e.g, surface
water, ground water, air, direct contact? The assess-
ment will depend on several factors, including the struc-
ture and integrity of the chemical waste disposal site,
the type and quantity ofchemicals disposed, the method
ofcontainment, the years of disposal, the biological per-
sistence of chemicals, the meteorologic and geologic
characteristics ofthe waste site, and the source ofwater
supply for residents of neighboring communities.
The extent of human exposure also depends on the
population sizes and proximity of communities nearby
the chemical waste site. In addition, the potential for
exposure may be related to human activities in these
communities, e.g., farming, fishing, hunting. Other en-
vironmental sources for population exposure to chemi-
cals with similar toxic effects, such as area-wide mosquito
controls, also need to be considered in assessing the
feasibility of a health effects study or the results from
such a study. Such population information would enable
BUFFLER, CRANE, AND KEY
one to estimate the acute versus chronic nature of ex-
posure as well as the intensity of such exposures. As a
general rule, potential human exposure levels around
abandoned waste sites may be much lower than around
active sites, unless persistent chemicals are involved.
Information indicating exposure to chemicals which per-
sist in human tissue would suggest the potential for
continuous and cumulative exposure for individuals long
after the environmental exposure has ceased. Exposure
to persistent chemicals may be determined objectively
by measuring tissue levels (1), which provides an op-
portunity for a more productive epidemiologic study
than exposure to transient or nonpersistent chemicals.
Studies of persistent chemicals are of particular impor-
tance, as most health studies of chemical waste disposal
sites may not be undertaken until long after the initial
exposures occurred.
Estimating the extent of human exposure may be
extremely difficult when groundwater contamination is
involved, as is often the case. The use of contaminated
aquifers for drinking water by populations quite remote
from the waste disposal site could result in a much larger
population exposed, but with a lower probability of de-
tecting any adverse health outcome because of the ex-
tremely low doses received. Specific health effects
associated with chemical contamination of drinking water
are discussed elsewhere in this series. Such exposures
are mentioned here to stress the importance of this
route of exposure and the additional complexity this
adds to epidemiologic studies of health effects that may
be related to chemical waste disposal sites.
The difficulties in conducting studies to unambigu-
ously assess health effects associated with population
exposure to chemical waste disposal sites cannot be suf-
ficiently emphasized. Many of the issues related to the
feasibility of such studies are outlined in the CDC draft
document entitled System of Prevention, Assessment
and Control of Exposures and Health Effects from Haz-
ardous Sites (2). Even with a known chemical inventory
and population at risk for a community, the ability of a
study to detect an effect when it is present (power of
study) may be severely limited by numerous factors.
Small population sizes, low background rates, long la-
tency periods, and the nonspecificity of many of the
potential health effects associated with chemical expo-
sures, especially those which occur with a greater fre-
quency (higher background rates) such as spontaneous
abortions, represent such constraining factors. In ad-
dition, the actual exposures experienced by the study
population may too low to result in detectable increases,
even for the nonspecific health outcomes assessed. These
limitations have prompted some epidemiologists to con-
sider the role of surveillance or "hypothesis-generating
studies" in communities where chemical waste disposal
sites are located. In the absence of specific exposure
data, exposure is presumed, and selected health indices
are examined to determine if there are demonstrable
(and statistically significant) increases or decreases in
the expected background rates. An essential component
of this approach is the selection of an appropriate ref-
erence or comparison community for deriving the ex-
pected rates.
The need for a health study in a community may be
prompted by either of two events. First, there may be
evidence ofa release ofchemicals into the environment.
Second, a real or apparent excess in the occurrence of
a relevant health outcome such as a "cluster" of cancer
cases in the community may be reported (3). In the
latter situation, the disease "cluster" may be identified
by routine health effects monitoring using available sta-
tistics or by word of mouth. The relevant health out-
come is known (or suspected), and the initial task is to
determine if the observed frequency of the disease in
time and space represents a significant departure from
the number of disease events that would be expected
in a population of this size. If the cluster can not be
explained by confounding factors, chance, or other fac-
tors, then the second, and by far the more difficult, task
is to determine if there is an association of chemical
exposures from the waste disposal site with the real or
apparent disease "cluster." The major difficulty en-
countered is the uncertainty in estimating individual
chemical exposures.
If documented chemical exposures occurred to pop-
ulations residing in the vicinity of a waste disposal site,
all relevant health outcomes should be reviewed inten-
sively for fluctuations of significance in routinely col-
lected health statistics. The need for additional studies
can then be determined on the basis of the available
exposure data and potential health effects.
A two-step statistical procedure for monitoring rou-
tinely reported health events (deaths, births, etc.) in
small populations has been outlined for communities ad-
jacent to low-level radioactive waste disposal sites (3).
Use of this procedure for monitoring calls for an "alert"
status when a number ofrelevant events exceeds a spec-
ified level during a given interval of time with followup
observation being continued for one more time period.
"Action" status is established if the excess continues to
be apparent in the second time period. The system also
allows for immediate action to be taken if the observed
number of events greatly exceeds expectation in the
first time period. The procedures outlined only initiate
further study and will not provide definitive data re-
garding the cause ofthe excess mortality or other health
indices. Such a procedure may be useful in assessing
the health effects ofexposure to chemical waste disposal
sites when exposure data are limited or unavailable, the
anticipated health effects are unknown, and residents
of the community are concerned regarding the per-
ceived health effects of the exposure, e.g., "clusters" of
cancer cases, birth defects, or infant deaths.
Potential health effects on target organs or tissues
that might be observed in studies of chemical waste
disposal sites were identified (Tables 1-9) from reported
human exposures to chemicals without regard to the
source of exposure. Table 10 presents a list of selected
chemicals having the potential to produce effects at con-
424
DETECTING HEALTH EFFECTS OF WASTE CHEMICALS
centrations sufficiently low that the public is not likely
to be aware of their presence. These cross-indexed ta-
bles of data are based on a review of the environmental,
occupational medicine, and toxicologic literature. It is
emphasized that Tables 1-10 are lists ofpotential health
effects from any environmental exposures to the chem-
icals (not all inclusive of chemicals or effects).
A major factor to consider in assessing the likelihood
of observing a potential health effect is the intensity
and duration of exposure. Short-term, very low expo-
sures are far less likely to induce any of the health
effects identified, whereas chronic exposures of any in-
tensity and acute high exposures may induce a wide
range of effects. Population exposures resulting from
chemical waste disposal sites are usually much lower
than those observed in work environments or accidental
environmental exposures. Therefore it may be less likely
that some effects associated with environmental expo-
sures in other settings will be observed.
Since few studies of health effects associated with
toxic waste disposal sites are available, a review ofthose
studies as well as others in which epidemics resulted
from point source release of chemicals into the environ-
ment was undertaken. The results of this review can
be seen in Table 11.
Thus, three approaches are reported here. First, the
adverse health effects that might be seen in clusters
and the associated causative agents are identified. Sec-
ond, the inverse of Tables 1-9 presents selected chem-
icals and their toxic effects (Table 10). The third is a
tabular review of the findings in published and unpub-
lished environmental exposure episodes.
Probable Target Organs Affected by
Toxic Wastes
List of chemicals known to have affected those target
organs (Tables 1-9) were prepared from a review of
recent occupational and toxicologic literature (246). Skin
and central nervous system conditions were judged to
be the most likely effects from direct contact with chem-
icals. Hepatic, hematopoietic, renal, reproductive, and
central nervous system effects were considered to be

the most likely indicators of chronic low-dose exposure
by way of ingestion. Both central nervous system and
reproductive disorders appeared likely to occur in a
number of exposure circumstances, both high and low
dose, and also from a variety of chemical agents. Lung,
gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular disorders, although
important in occupational exposures, were considered
unlikely in low-dose exposure situations such as would
occur around a toxic waste disposal site.
Chemically Induced Effects in
Humans by Target Organ
Once a list ofrelevant outcomes had been constructed,a review ofoccupational and human toxicological studies
was undertaken, and a list of chemicals that had been
associated with each effect was prepared (Tables 1-10).
Most of the references are case reports and clinical se-
ries, and relatively few associations have been docu-
mented in well'designed epidemiologic studies. More
information is available -for dermatologic and central
nervous effects than for other target organs, and this
is reflected in Tables 1-10.
The immune system was omitted from consideration
because it was believed that procedures for evaluation
of alterations in immune response were not yet in stan-
dard practice in the same way as, for example, hepatic
or renal profiles. Similarly, studies of cytogenetic ab-
normalities of peripheral blood was also considered to
still be in the developmental phase.
Review of Environmental Exposure
Episodes
Table 11 summarizes point-source epidemics resulting
from accidental releases of chemicals into the environ-
ment. The chemical or chemicals and circumstances of
exposure are described, followed by the study design
employed to assess health effects, the method for as-
sessment ofexposure, and the results. Included are four
episodes involving mixtures from chemical waste dis-
posal sites, seven involving miscellaneous single chem-

icals, five involving polyhalogenated biphenyls, six with
organic pesticides, and nine involving heavy metals. The
reported effects were very much dose-dependent.
In all situations in which food supplies were contam-
inated, sequelae were rapid and severe. Symptoms were
generally similar to those noted in occupational expo-
sures with skin, gastrointestinal, and central nervous
system effects predominating. Contamination of water
supplies, in presumably much lower concentrations, did
not always result in clear-cut responses. In situations
such as the waste disposal sites in which toxic chemicals
were not identified in food or water, unequivocal ad-
verse health effects were rarely detected.
Contamination of Food Supplies
Contamination of food supplies by some organic pes-
ticides (endrin, parathion) resulted in severe CNS ef-
fects (271, 272, 275, 276), whereas others caused either
no effect (DDT at low doses) (266) or, for hexachloro-
benzene, a severe cutaneous porphyria (273, 274). Con-
tamination by metallic pesticides such as methylmercury
poisoning in Iraq in 1960 and 1971, resulted in severe
dose-dependent central nervous system defects (287).
Other chemical contamination of food supplies resulted
in various sequelae, such as 4,4'-diaminodiphenylme-
thane (liver and CNS disturbances) (254), o-cresyl phos-
phate (CNS disturbances, anemia) (255, 256), and PCBs
(chloracne, reproductive disorders, and
bances) (27, 264, 265).

Contamination of Water Supplies
Certain areas of Taiwan have very high background
levels of arsenic (400-600 ppb) which have been cor-
related with rates of skin cancer and "black foot dis-
ease", a disorder of the peripheral circulation (278, 279.
Similar studies in the U.S. (277) failed to replicate this
finding, although mean concentrations were lower (16.5
ppb in rural areas and 4.8 ppb in urban areas) than in
Taiwan. A Chilean study which reported arsenic levels
in water supplies comparable to those in Taiwan noted
a substantial decrease in the frequency of various cu-
taneous lesions in hospitalized patients after a filtration
plant began operations (280).
Hematological and peripheral nervous system effects
were noted in families in rural areas ofScotland drinking
contaminated water from lead-lined pipes in their homes
(282). These effects were similar to those noted in oc-
cupational exposures to lead.
One report of phenol in drinking water noted a syn-
drome consisting of diarrhea, mouth sores, dark urine,
and burning in the mouth. No differences in clinical or
laboratory findings were noted between exposed indi-
viduals and controls 6 months after the episode (253).

Several heavy metals, including cadmium, were re-

a Attention was directed at identifying chemicals or other environmental agents shown or suspected to be capable of inducing reproduc-
tive effects in humans, excluding the effects of maternal use of drugs, smoking, and ethanol during conception and pregnancy, exposure of
hospital personnel to anesthetic gases and the effects of radiation exposures. The reproductive effects of these exposures are well known
and extensively documented (117-124). Chemicals are identified as "suspected" as capable of inducing a health effect in humans when the
human evidence is deficient or when only animal (experimental) data are available.

tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, TCDD), one of the by-prod-
ucts resulting from the conditions in the reactor, was
identified in soil samples taken from several areas around
the plant. The population around the plant experienced
immediate effects, such as burns and contact dermatitis
from exposure to trichlorophenol, followed within a few
weeks by comedones and epidermal cysts typical of
chloracne associated with dioxin. Dermatological prob-

lems were not correlated with environmental dioxin con-
centrations except in the immediate vicinity ofthe plant
(259). Cytogenetic studies ofsubsets ofexposed persons
revealed no differences from unexposed control subjects
(261), and results from immunologic studies were equiv-
ocal (260). Studies of reproductive effects were also
equivocal due to difficulties in establishing appropriate
comparison groups, reporting biases and small numbers
ofevents (262). A registry has been established for long-
term morbidity and mortality studies but, other than
the initial dermatological problems, no unusual prob-
lems had been reported as of three years after the
incident.
Another incident involving dioxin occurred in Mis-
souri, when waste oils containing dioxin were sprayed
for dust control on residential, recreational, and work
areas. Once the problem was discovered, a case-control
study was initiated to examine health effects in a group
of individuals at high risk of exposure as compared to
controls. No cases of chloracne or porphyria cutanea
tarda were noted, nor were any discernible differences
in immune, renal, or hepatic function noted between
exposed and control subjects. The authors emphasized
that this should be considered a pilot study, and also
noted that a method for measuring the body burden of
TCDD would be extremely helpful in studies ofthis sort
(258).

Polyhalogenated biphenyls have been released into
the environment by contamination of animal feed in
Michigan (268), sewage sludge later used as fertilizer
(267) and presumably as by-products of pesticide man-
ufacturing released into a stream (266). In each ofthese
instances, a direct measure of exposure, in the form of
serum levels of the chemical, was available. In none of
the three studies were serum PBB or PCB levels as-
sociated with overt adverse health effects. However,
immunologic studies on a subset of the exposed popu-
lation in Michigan were conflicting, with an early study
showing decreases in T-cell function, as measured by
E-rosette formation, and increases in number of null
cells (269), but a subsequent study failed to confirm this
result (268).
Bioconcentration of organic mercury in Minimata Bay,
Japan resulted in an epidemic of neurologic disease in
adults and severe neurologic sequelae in children ex-
posed in utero who ate fish and shellfish from the bay
(79, 158). Other episodes of heavy metal poisoning have
included exposure to lead from smelters that resulted
in high blood lead levels in children living nearthe smelt-
ers (283, 284). Although no physiological deficits were
noted in the children with elevated blood lead levels,
performance on several scales within a battery of IQ
tests was said to be compromised in the exposed chil-
dren (285).
Exposures Resulting from Chemical Waste
Disposal Sites
The prototypical episode for exposure to toxic chem-
icals from chemical waste disposal sites is Love Canal.
Although much has been written, very little data have
been published. One carefully controlled study of cy-
togenetic abnormalities noted no differences in fre-
quency of chromosomal aberrations or sister chromatid
exchanges between exposed and control subjects (247).
An ecological study which examined incidence rates of
cancer in the Love Canal area versus the rest ofupstate
New York noted no excesses of any site except possibly
lung (248). The lung cancer excess was not consistent
across age groups. Few additional data are available for
review, although a summary of other clinical investi-
gations noted: ". . . Information was sought on a wide
range of conditions. No unusual patterns were noted,
except possibly with respect to certain reproductive ef-
fects.... Although an increased frequency of low birth
weight in women from homes with possible seepage risk
suggested a toxic effect, the finding does not correspond
well with NYSDH [New York State Department of
Health] environmental test results" (1).
Leachate from an abandoned chemical waste disposal
site in Chester, Pennsylvania, caught on fire in Feb-
ruary, 1978. The CDC subsequently investigated the
site to determine health effects in residents around the
site or in the firemen who extinguished the fire. At the
time ofthe CDC investigation in October, 1979, several

Both groups were equally likely
to have a history of exposures
as defined by proximity to
plant, deaths of animals at
home, consumption of locally
grown food.
Ten tests of immunologic func-
tion were performed (without
knowledge of exposure)
Total serum complement hemo-
lytic values were higher in ex-
posed children than controls,
and higher in children with
than without chloracne.
Response to mitogens was
higher in exposed children
than controls, but chloracne
was not related to this
finding.
Results were not anticipated
since TCDD experiments in
animals suggest an immuno-
suppressant effect.
Cytogenetic abnormalities oc-
curred with equal frequency
in all groups studied. In some
cases the presence of at least
one aberrant cell was higher
in exposed than non-exposed
subjects. "The results so far
do not suggest a straight-
forward conclusion."
Aberrations were scored
blindly, i.e., without knowl-
edge of exposure status.
Possible increase in malforma-
tions but authors note severe
problems in the comparison
group. Rates appear similar
to those reported elsewhere
in Europe.
Skin: brown pigmentation of
nails, acnelike skin eruptions,
hyperpigmentation of skin.
Eye: discharge, swelling of lids.
CNS: feeling of weakness.

predominantly chlorinated pesticides. Residents in the
area were classified as having a high, intermediate or
low exposure based on well water concentration of or-
ganics. No chlorinated organic chemicals or likely me-
tabolites were detected in the urine of any subjects.
Liver function tests (alkaline phosphatase, SGOT) were
elevated in exposed individuals, but a subset who were
retested 3 months later had returned to normal levels.
The medical examination showed no significant differ-
ences between any of the exposure groups except for
borderline hepatomegaly in the exposure groups. Renal
function was normal in all groups. The authors con-
cluded that transitory liver injury probably occurred in
this population as a result of drinking the contaminated
water (252).
One other episode involving toxic chemical wastes
was reported from Woburn, Massachusetts. The resi-
dents of Woburn had complained about the quality of
the municipal water supply for many years, and the
discovery of waste disposal sites and contamination of
well and ground water aroused community concern. A
cluster of childhood leukemias was subsequently de-
scribed and investigated by the state health department
and CDC. The parents of juvenile leukemia (N = 12),
adult kidney cancer (N = 10), and adult liver cancer
(N = 5) cases from the time period 1969-1978 were in-
corporated into a case-control study. An extensive in-
terview that dealt with environmental exposures was
conducted with each case and two controls. The report
concluded that the ". . . information gathered thus far
fails to provide evidence establishing an association be-
tween environmental hazards and the increased inci-
dence of childhood leukemia and renal cancer in Woburn"
(251). A subsequent study by a different team of in-
vestigators was directed at reproductive and childhood
disorders in residents of Woburn. A telephone survey
using a questionnaire administered by local community
volunteers was used to determine health data for mem-
bers of households in the city. Rates of reproductive
events and childhood cancer were computed by geo-
graphical area of the city, and these areas were chosen
to correspond to those served by the water wells. Two
of these wells had been contaminated by leachate, and
the authors concluded that a consistent pattern of in-
creased childhood leukemia, perinatal deaths and cer-
tain birth defects and childhood disorders was associated
with the availability of water from the contaminated
wells (250).
From this brief review of environmental exposure
episodes, the following conclusions appear warranted.
The severity and immediacy of responses are dose-
related, and are directly related to route of exposure.
Episodes in which food was directly or indirectly con-
taminated resulted in the most severe response. Water
as a route ofexposure was not inconsequential, but only
in relatively high dose situations were clear clinical ill-
nesses apparent. In low dose situations, many exposed
individuals were asymptomatic or showed only tran-
sient subelinical illness.
Although inhalation is a possible route of exposure,
in only two episodes did it occur. In Seveso, Italy, no
respiratory symptoms were mentioned, although an ex-
plosion had occurred. In Chester, Pennsylvania, a fire
in a dump caused cough, headache, and skin problems
in firemen responsible for extinguishing the blaze.
Direct contact was more likely to have sequelae than
inhalation, but neither route was as important as
ingestion.
Direct measures of exposure were rarely available,
the exceptions being serum levels ofPBBs, PCBs, DDT,
and lead. In the absence of direct methods of ascer-
taining exposure, it was extremely difficult to observe
a dose-response relationship in exposed populations, and
thus difficult to show an association with the putative
exposure.
In low-dose situations, detectable health effects were
rarely reported, especially ifhealth outcomes were eval-
uated without knowledge of exposure status. The pre-
dominant health effects reported in these low exposure
situations were more likely to be nonspecific (neuro-
behavioral, reproductive, hepatic, renal).
Predominant health effects were predictable on the
basis of data from occupational health studies. In high-
dose situations, skin, central nervous system, liver, kid-
ney, and reproductive outcomes predominated. In mod-
erate exposure situations, hematologic abnormalities
were frequent. In low dose situations, CNS, liver, and
reproductive abnormalities were observed.
Tables 1-10 should serve as useful starting points for
identification of health effects possibly induced by ex-
posure to toxic chemicals from waste disposal sites. Any
future review should include attention to the route of
exposure, the concentration of the substances, the bi-
ological measure ofexposure employed (ifany such mea-
sure was used), the ascertainment and assessment of
disease, the study design (cases alone or control group
as well) and study methods (blind assessment of disease
and/or exposure) and attention to confounding by the
authors in analyzing and interpreting their results. This
activity should lead to a more compact guide of likely
effects attributable to chemical exposure from chemical
waste disposal sites.
The authors wish to thank Mr. Francis Williams for his technical
help in the preparation of this manuscript.
