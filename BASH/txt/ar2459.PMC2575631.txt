Abstract
Introduction Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) are
multipotent progenitor cells in adult tissues, for example, bone
marrow (BM). Current challenges of clinical application of BM-
derived MPCs include donor site morbidity and pain as well as
low cell yields associated with an age-related decrease in cell
number and differentiation potential, underscoring the need to
identify alternative sources of MPCs. Recently, MPC sources
have diversified; examples include adipose, placenta, umbilicus,
trabecular bone, cartilage, and synovial tissue. In the present
work, we report the presence of MPCs in human tonsillar tissue.
Methods We performed comparative and quantitative analyses
of BM-MPCs with a subpopulation of adherent cells isolated
from this lymphoid tissue, termed tonsil-derived MPCs (T-
MPCs). The expression of surface markers was assessed by
fluorescent-activated cell sorting analysis. Differentiation
potential of T-MPCs was analyzed histochemically and by
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for the
expression of lineage-related marker genes. The
immunosuppressive properties of MPCs were determined in
vitro in mixed lymphocyte reactions.
Results Surface epitope analysis revealed that T-MPCs were
negative for CD14, CD31, CD34, and CD45 expression and
positive for CD29, CD44, CD90, and CD105 expression, a
characteristic phenotype of BM-MPCs. Similar to BM-MPCs, T-
MPCs could be induced to undergo adipogenic differentiation
and, to a lesser extent, osteogenic and chondrogenic
differentiation. T-MPCs did not express class II major
histocompatibility (MHC) antigens, and in a similar but less
pronounced manner compared with BM-MPCs, T-MPCs were
immunosuppressive, inhibiting the proliferation of T cells
stimulated by allogeneic T cells or by non-specific mitogenic
stimuli via an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-dependent
mechanism.
Conclusion Human palatine T-MPCs represent a new source of
progenitor cells, potentially applicable for cell-based therapies.

osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and myocytes [1-3].
Due to their differentiation capacities, MPCs have emerged as
a promising tool for therapeutic applications in tissue engi-
neering and cell and gene therapy. Animal studies have shown
that MPC implantation can repair critical bone fracture in a rat
model of femoral segmental defect [4] and that, after systemic
injection, MPCs localize to the site of experimentally induced
fractures [5]. Pilot clinical studies have demonstrated the fea-
sibility of allogeneic BM transplantation in the treatment of
osteogenesis imperfecta. BM-derived MPCs (BM-MPCs)
engrafted and generated donor-derived osteoblasts that
improved the clinical signs associated with the disease and
enhanced total body weight [6]. Besides their multilineage
potential, MPCs display immunoregulatory properties that
have prompted consideration of their use in BM transplanta-
tion. Indeed, a recent study reports the successful use of
MPCs to treat severe grade IV acute graft-versus-host disease
in one patient after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell trans-
plantation [7]. Although the exact immunosuppressive mecha-
nisms are unknown, the capacity of MPCs to suppress T-cell
proliferation stimulated by allogeneic lymphocytes, dendritic
cells, and phytohemaglutinin (PHA) is well documented [8].
Mechanisms involving cell contact. [9] as well as soluble fac-
tors [10,11] have been proposed, particularly the involvement
of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) via its induction of indoleamine
2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme involved in the catabolism
of tryptophan, an essential amino acid required for protein syn-
thesis and T-cell proliferation [12,13].
At present, BM is considered the most accessible source of
adult MPCs. However, BM-MPC derivation has complications,
including pain, donor site morbidity, and low cell yields upon
harvest. Furthermore, the number of BM-MPCs and their pro-
liferation rate and differentiating potential have been shown to
decrease with donor age. [14]. Given that MPCs undergo a
decline in their differentiation and expansion capacity with
physiological aging, identification of potential sources of
MPCs easily accessible from young donors is currently of main
interest for cell-based therapy. [15]. The search for alternative
sources of MPCs is thus of significant value. To date, MPCs
have been isolated from a number of adult tissues, including
trabecular bone [16], fat [17,18], synovium. [19,20], skin [21],
thymus [22], periodontal ligament. [23] as well as prenatal and
perinatal tissues such as umbilical cord blood. [24], umbilical
cord [25], and placenta. [26].
This study explores the possibility of identifying and isolating
MPCs from human palatine tonsils. Tonsillar epithelium is
derived from the second pharyngeal pouch (of endodermal ori-
gin) and during fetal development is invaded by lymphoid tis-
sue (of mesodermal origin). Therefore, embryologically, tonsils
could be a source of MPCs. Because of the prevalence of ton-
sillectomy procedure, tonsils are easily accessible, particularly
from young donors and, if necessary, tonsillar biopsy can be
easily obtained without major complications under local
anesthesia. Our results show that MPCs exist in the stroma of
palatine tonsils and can be isolated and expanded in culture.
These tonsil-derived MPCs (T-MPCs) show multipotent differ-
entiation properties and share similar immunosuppressive
characteristics as BM-MPCs in mixed lymphocyte reaction
(MLR). The immunosuppressive activity is significant and
dose-dependent, though at a lower level than that of BM-
MPCs. The difference in immuosuppressive activity correlates
with the level of cell surface IFN-γ receptor (IFN-γR) as well as
the differential ability of IFN-γ to stimulate IDO activity by T-
MPCs compared with BM-MPCs.
Materials and methods
T-MPC and BM-MPC isolation and culture
With institutional review board approval (George Washington
University, Washington, DC, USA), tonsils were obtained after
informed consent from patients (4 to 15 years old) undergoing
tonsillectomy as a result of recurrent episodes of acute tonsil-
litis. The tissue was minced and digested in RPMI medium
(Gibco-BRL, now part of Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) containing 210 U/mL collagenase type I (Invitrogen
Corporation) and 90 KU/mL DNase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) for 30 minutes at 37°C. Following filtration through
a wire mesh, the cells were washed twice in 20% normal
human serum (NHS)-RPMI and once with 10% NHS-RPMI.
Mononuclear cells were obtained by Ficoll-Paque (Amersham,
now part of GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire,
UK) density gradient centrifugation of digested tonsil tissue.
Cells were plated after 24 to 48 hours in T-150 cm2 tissue cul-
ture flasks (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA), and
non-adherent cells were washed away with expansion medium
consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)
(Invitrogen Corporation) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
from selected lots (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) and antibiotics
(50 μg/mL streptomycin and 50 IU/mL penicillin; Invitrogen
Corporation).
For BM-MPCs, BM was obtained after informed consent from
patients (39 to 58 years old) undergoing lower extremity
reconstructive surgery with institutional review board approval
(University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA, and George
Washington University) and was processed by direct plating
as described previously. [27]. BM aspirates were plated over-
night in T-150 cm2 culture flasks in the same expansion
medium as T-MPCs, and adherent cells were obtained simi-
larly. Both T-MPCs and BM-MPCs were culture-expanded in
basal medium at 37°C and 5% CO2 using T-150 Triple Flask
(Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), and medium changes were done
twice weekly.
Cell proliferation, limiting dilution assays, and colony-
forming unit-fibroblast assays
To estimate cell proliferation, cultures of T-MPCs and BM-
MPCs plated at 1 × 104 cells per square centimeter in 12-well
plates in basal medium were analyzed on days 3, 4, 7, 10, 12,

and 14, using MTS (methanethiosulfonate) assay according to
the protocol of the manufacturer (Promega Corporation, Mad-
ison, WI, USA). T-MPCs plated into six-well plates in serial
dilutions (1 × 107, 1 × 106, 1 × 105, and 1 × 104 cells per well,
in triplicate) were cultured in expansion medium for 2 weeks,
fixed with 10% formalin, and stained with Giemsa (Sigma-
Aldrich), and colonies of fibroblast-like cells were identified
and counted based on the methods described by Castro-
Malaspina and colleagues. [28]. Colony-forming unit-fibroblast
(CFU-F) potential, the average number of cells required to pro-
duce one colony, was determined by plating aliquots (1,000
cells per square centimeter) of T-MPCs in expansion medium
for 14 days and was analyzed as described previously [29].
Cell surface epitope profiling
For immunofluorescence, undifferentiated cells were washed
twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen Corpora-
tion), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (FD NeuroTech-
nologies, Inc., Ellicott City, MD, USA) for 15 minutes, and then
permeabilized in a PBS solution containing 300 mM sucrose,
3 mM MgCl2, and 0.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 (Bio-Rad Labo-
ratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) for 5 minutes at 4°C. Cells
were stained for cell surface markers (negative markers:
CD14, CD34, and CD45; positive markers: CD29, CD44, and
CD105) using specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (all
obtained from BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) at 0.5 ng/
μL for 2 hours. Secondary immunostaining was done with
Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin
(diluted at 1:400) (Molecular Probes Inc., now part of Invitro-
gen Corporation) for 1 hour. Nuclear counterstaining was
done with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride
(DAPI) (Invitrogen Corporation) for 5 minutes at 12 μg/30 mL
PBS. Immunostained cultures were mounted with Fluoro-
mount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) and
observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss
LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For flow cytometry, T-
MPCs (>1 × 105 cells) were washed and resuspended in PBS
+ 0.1% FBS (PF) containing saturating concentrations (1:100
dilution) of the following conjugated mouse IgG1,κ anti-human
monoclonal antibodies (BD Biosciences): HLA-A, B, C-phyco-
erythrin (PE) (MHC I), HLA-DR, DP, DQ-fluorescein isothiocy-
anate (FITC) (MHC II), CD45-FITC, CD14-PE, CD31-PE,
CD34-PE, CD73-PE, CD90-FITC, CD105-PE as well as IFN-
γR1-PE (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) for 1 hour
at 4°C. Cell suspensions were washed twice and resus-
pended in PF for analysis on a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur;
BD Biosciences) using the CellQuest ProTM software (BD
Biosciences).
In vitro differentiation
T-MPCs and BM-MPCs were induced to undergo adipogenic,
osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation as described
previously. [27]. For adipogenic differentiation, cells were
seeded into six-well tissue culture plates at a density of
20,000 cells per square centimeter and treated for 3 weeks
with adipogenic medium, consisting of DMEM with 10% FBS,
and supplemented with 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine
(IBMX), 1 μg/mL insulin, and 1 μM dexamethasone (all from
Sigma-Aldrich). For osteogenic differentiation, cells were
seeded into six-well plates (Corning Incorporated) at a density
of 20,000 cells per square centimeter and treated for 3 weeks
with osteogenic medium, consisting of DMEM with 10% FBS,
and supplemented with 10 mM β-glycerolphosphate, 10 nM
dexamethasone, 50 μg/mL ascorbic acid-2-phosphate, and
10 nM 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Biomol International L.P., Ply-
mouth Meeting, PA, USA). To induce chondrogenic differenti-
ation, 96-microwell polypropylene plates (Nunc) were seeded
with 300,000 cells per well, and cell pellets formed by centrif-
ugation at 1,100 rpm for 6 minutes. The pellet cultures were
treated for 3 weeks with chondrogenic medium, consisting of
high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 100 nM dexametha-
sone, 50 μg/mL ascorbic acid-2-phosphate, 100 μg/mL
sodium pyruvate, 40 μg/mL L-proline, 10 ng/mL recombinant
human transforming growth factor-β3 (R&D Systems, Inc.),
and 50 mg/mL insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS)-premix stock
(BD Biosciences).
Histology and histochemistry
Oil red O staining
Three-week adipogenic cultures of MPCs were rinsed twice
with PBS, fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde, stained with
Oil red O (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 minutes at room temperature,
and counterstained with Harris-hematoxylin solution (Sigma-
Aldrich) to visualize lipid droplets.
Alizarin red S staining
MPCs cultured for 3 weeks in osteogenic medium were fixed
with 60% isopropyl alcohol and stained for 3 minutes with 2%
(wt/vol) Alizarin red S (Rowley Biochemical Inc., Danvers, MA,
USA) at pH 4.2 to detect mineralization.
Alcian blue staining
Chondrogenic cell pellets were fixed in 4% buffered parafor-
maldehyde, rinsed with PBS, serially dehydrated, paraffin-
embedded, and sectioned at 10-μm thickness for histological
staining with Alcian blue (pH 1.0) for sulfated proteoglycans.
Total RNA isolation and real-time reverse transcription-
polymerase chain reaction
Total cellular RNA samples extracted from day 21 monolayer
and pellet cultures using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen Corpora-
tion) were reverse-transcribed using random hexamers. Real-
time polymerase chain reactions were performed using 10 ng
of cDNA and SYBR Green mix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.).
Gene-specific primers (forward/reverse) were designed
based on GenBank cDNA sequences and are listed in Table
1: (a) adipogenesis genes: lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and perox-
isome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ), (b)
osteogenesis genes: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and
osteocalcin (OC), and (c) chondrogenesis genes: collagen

type II α1 (COL2) and aggrecan (AGN). Specific transcript
levels were normalized by comparison to that of the house-
keeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH). Expression levels were presented as the fold
increase over that of GAPDH, using the formula 2(ΔCt), where
ΔCt = Ct of target gene – Ct of GAPDH.
Primary mixed lymphocyte reaction
Peripheral blood from healthy human donors was collected
into heparinized containers (BD Biosciences), and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll-
Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. Mouse splenocytes
were isolated in 10 mL of RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen Cor-
poration) as described previously. [30]. Responder human
PBMCs or splenocytes from CD-1 mice and stimulator human
PBMCs or splenocytes from A/J mice were resuspended in
RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine,
100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 0.1 mM
non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 20 mM
HEPES, and 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen Corpora-
tion). Splenocytes were seeded in triplicates at 1 × 105 cells/
100 μL per well in 96-well round-bottom plates (BD Bio-
sciences). PHA was used at 5 μg/mL as a positive control
mitogen to induce T-cell proliferation. MPCs (5 × 104 cells
unless stated otherwise) were added to obtain a final volume
of 300 μL. After 3 days of incubation, 1 μCi/well [3H]-thymi-
dine (GE Healthcare) was added overnight and radioactivity
incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting.
All experiments were performed in triplicates and repeated at
least twice.
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity assay
Cells were stimulated with IFN-γ (100 ng/mL) for 72 hours in
DMEM supplemented with L-tryptophan (100 μg/mL). In some
experiments, a neutralizing antibody (anti-IFN-γR1, 1.5 μg/mL;
R&D Systems, Inc.) was added to the cultures. IDO enzyme
activity in the culture supernatant was measured spectropho-
tometrically based on tryptophan-to-kynurenine conversion, as
described previously. [20].
Interferon-gamma assay
IFN-γ in culture supernatants was quantified using a commer-
cially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D
Systems, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

were analyzed statistically using the Student t test, with statis-
tical significance set at a P value of less than 0.05.
Results
Cell viability, proliferation, and clonogenicity
The cell yield from each tonsil ranged from 1 to 5 × 109, with
the majority being non-adherent and likely of hematopoietic
origin. After multiple buffer washes and subsequent medium
changes, approximately 0.1% to 1% of the isolated cells were
found to be adherent. Cell colonies from processed tonsillar
specimens began to appear approximately 5 to 10 days after
initial plating. Three different cell morphologies were generally
observed: (a) fibroblast-like spindle-shaped morphology, (b)
round morphology and large nuclei (monocytic contamina-
tion), and (c) very small, epitheloid cells with polygonal mor-
phology (Figure 1a). After trypsinization at each passage, the
round cell population remained attached to the flasks, and was
no longer detected by passage 2, confirmed subsequently by
negative expression of CD14, a myelomonocytic marker. The
small epitheloid cells rapidly disappeared from the culture as
early as passage 1. At later passages, T-MPCs were homoge-
neously fibroblast-like, with extended cytoplasmic processes.
Morphologically, these cells were indistinguishable from BM-
MPCs at similar passage numbers (Figure 1a). In general, T-
MPCs were somewhat smaller than BM-MPCs, with a cell
yield of 7 to 10 × 106 cells per 80% confluent Nunc triple flask
compared with 4 to 8 × 106 BM-MPCs. The proliferation pro-
files of T-MPCs and BM-MPCs were distinctly different (Figure
1b). Plated at the same initial cell number, T-MPCs proliferated
at a faster rate compared with BM-MPCs throughout the assay
period. The population doubling times for T-MPCs and BM-
MPCs were calculated to be 37.1 ± 3.4 hours and 58.2 ± 2.3
hours, respectively. By day 14, T-MPCs and BM-MPCs under-
went 2.70 ± 0.13 and 1.69 ± 0.06 population doublings,
respectively. Upon plating at limiting dilution under CFU-F
assay conditions, the initial isolates of T-MPCs showed a linear
relationship between colony number and cell number, sug-
gesting that one T-MPC was limiting for CFU-F. The CFU-F
frequency in the tonsil digest was determined to be approxi-
mately 1 in 6,000 cells plated.
Immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analyses
T-MPCs and BM-MPCs expressed similar surface epitope
profiles (that is, positive/negative for the same cell markers).
Based on immunofluorescence staining, T-MPCs and BM-
MPCs were both positive for CD29, CD44, and CD105 and
negative for CD14, CD34, and CD45 (Figure 2a). Similar to
BM-MPCs, T-MPCs were positive for MHC class I molecules
and negative for MHC class II molecules in basal culture con-
ditions (data not shown). Flow cytometric analysis of T-MPCs
confirmed that T-MPCs were non-hematopoietic cells based
on their lack of CD45 and unlikely to be of endothelial origin
(negative for CD31; data not shown). Importantly, T-MPCs
exhibited a similar cell surface epitope phenotype as BM-
MPCs, specifically expressing CD105, CD73, and CD90 (Fig-
ures 2b and 2c). Fluorescence intensities for these markers
were not statistically different between the two cell popula-
tions, suggesting a similar level of expression in both cell pop-
ulations, except for CD90 (P = 0.022), which was higher in T-
MPCs.
Multilineage differentiation potential
Adipogenesis
Passage 2–5 T-MPCs were treated with adipogenic supple-
ments, with controls including T-MPCs and BM-MPCs of the
same passage maintained and cultured in expansion medium,
and BM-MPCs cultured in adipogenic medium. Morphological
changes in BM-MPCs and T-MPCs and the formation of cyto-

types of cell morphologies are apparent under phase-contrast micros-

T-MPCs and BM-MPCs is observed, with T-MPCs proliferating at a
faster rate than BM-MPCs throughout the assay period. Values are
mean ± standard deviation (n = 9).

plasmic lipid droplets were noticeable as early as 1 week of
adipogenic induction, as visualized by Oil red O staining (Fig-
ure 3a). mRNA expression of LPL and PPARγ was detected
by quantitative RT-PCR (Table 1) after 21 days of induction
and revealed a similar expression level of the two markers in T-
MPCs and BM-MPCs (Figure 3b). Interestingly, expression of
adipogenic markers was significantly stronger in higher pas-
sages of T-MPCs (P4 and P5) than in lower passages (P2 and
P3) (data not shown).
Osteogenesis
Upon osteogenic induction, the morphology of both T-MPCs
and BM-MPCs changed from spindle-shaped to flattened and
spread. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed lower levels of
OC and ALP mRNA in T-MPCs compared with BM-MPCs
(Figure 3b). Osteoblastic phenotype was also detected based
on positive staining for ALP (not shown) and Alizarin red S
(Figure 3a).
Chondrogenesis
The chondrogenic potential of BM-MPCs and T-MPCs was
evaluated in high-density pellet cultures maintained in serum-
free chondrogenic medium. After 3 weeks of culture, matrix
sulfated proteoglycan accumulation in chondrogenic cultures
was detectable by Alcian blue staining (Figure 3a). Quantita-
tive RT-PCR analysis revealed a significant increase of AGN
and COL2 expression in both T-MPCs and BM-MPCs,
although the increase in COL2 expression was significantly
lower in T-MPCs pellets compared with BM-MPCs (Figure
3b).
Inhibition of proliferation of alloreactive T cells
The MLR was used to test the immunosuppressive properties
of T-MPCs and BM-MPCs. Initially, using human PBMCs from
healthy donors as responding cells and PHA as a mitogen, the
addition of BM-MPCs and T-MPCs both inhibited the PHA-
induced proliferative response of PBMCs (Figure 4a). In the
MLR, BM-MPCs and T-MPCs were also seen to suppress the
proliferation of responder PBMCs, elicited by allogeneic
PBMCs (Figure 4a). In parallel, the level of IFNγ, which
reflected T-cell proliferation, showed a decrease in the MLR
proportionally in the presence of MPCs isolated from both tis-
sues, but to a significantly lower extent with T-MPCs, support-
ing a less potent suppressive activity of these cells (Figure 4b).
Proliferation suppression by T-MPCs was dose-dependent
and was partially reversed at a T-MPC-to-responder cell ratio
of 1:5, suggesting a potent effector mechanism (Figure 4c).
Indeed, similar to BM-MPCs, T-MPC suppression of T-cell pro-
liferation was dose-dependent for PHA stimulation as well as
in an MLR. However, the immunomodulatory activity of T-
MPCs was significantly less pronounced than that of BM-
MPCs. The immunosuppressive activities of human BM-MPCs
and T-MPCs also crossed the species barrier. When CD-1
murine splenocytes were stimulated with allogeneic A/J splen-
ocytes, dose-dependent inhibition of the proliferative response
was seen when xenogeneic human BM-MPCs and T-MPCs
were added (Figure 4d).

Involvement of interferon-gamma and indoleamine 2,3-
dioxygenase in MPC-mediated immunosuppression
MPC immunosuppression was recently shown to require IFN-
γ (produced by T cells and natural killer [NK] cells) to stimulate
IDO production by MPCs, which in turn inhibits the prolifera-
tion of activated T or NK cells. [13]. Also, treatment with neu-
tralizing anti-IFN-γR antibody completely abrogated the
immunosuppressive effect of MPCs. Analysis of BM-MPCs
and T-MPCs showed that both cell types expressed IFN-γR1,
with a substantially higher level in the former (Figure 5a). Incu-
bation with IFN-γ resulted in induction of IDO activity in both
cell populations, with a lower level in T-MPCs (Figure 5b). Fur-
thermore, the IFN-γ-induced IDO activity was completely sup-
pressed by neutralizing anti-IFN-γR1 antibody. These findings
thus strongly suggested that the immunsuppressive activities
of both BM-MPCs and T-MPCs were mediated via IDO activ-
ity, with BM-MPCs being more active. This differential inhibi-
tory ability correlated with a reduced capacity of T-MPCs to
decrease IFN-γ secretion as well as to induce their IDO activity
as compared with BM-MPCs (Figure 5b).
Discussion
The purpose of this study was twofold: (a) to assess the exist-
ence of MPCs in human palatine tonsils and to characterize
their phenotype, and (b) to determine and compare the
differentiation potential and immunomodulatory activity of
these cells (T-MPCs) to those of the well-characterized MPCs
isolated from BM (BM-MPCs). The results showed that human
palatine tonsils contained a multipotent MPC population. By
means of standard procedure, T-MPCs can be successfully
isolated and expanded in vitro. The initial cell population (post
tonsil digest) was contaminated with non-fibroblastoid tissue
culture adherent cell types; specifically, monocytes remained
attached to the polystyrene flasks even after extensive trypsini-
zation, while epitheloid cells did not survive under the expan-
sion medium conditions used to grow BM-MPCs. Only the
fibroblastoid cell population remained after two passages. The
proliferation profile of T-MPCs in our study was significantly
different from that of BM-MPCs, with an average population
doubling time of 37 hours compared with 58 hours for BM-
MPCs. This discrepancy between T-MPCs and BM-MPCs
observed in this study is probably in part age-related as it is
well documented that BM-MPCs from older donors have a
slower proliferation rate at the initial passage up to cell senes-
cence [31,32]. Since the BM-MPCs used here are from old
donors whereas the T-MPCs are derived from children, our
observation is thus consistent with the previous age-related
observations, although intrinsic differences between BM-
MPCs and T-MPCs cannot be ruled out.
The CD surface epitope profile of T-MPCs was characterized
by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Confocal micros-
copy revealed that both BM-MPCs and T-MPCs expressed
CD29, CD44, CD90, and CD105, but hematopoietic surface
markers, including CD14, CD34, and CD45, were absent.

Furthermore, flow cytometric analyses of T-MPCs confirmed
the non-hematopoietic and non-endothelial nature of T-MPCs,
based on their lack of expression of CD45 and CD31,
respectively. Taken together, these findings showed that T-
MPCs share a similar phenotypic profile with BM-MPCs.
The multilineage potential of T-MPCs was shown based on
their ability to differentiate into multiple mesenchymal lineages,
including fat, bone, and cartilage. Histological analysis clearly
showed adipocytes containing lipid droplets, matrix accumula-
tion of sulfated glycosaminoglycans in cell pellets, and areas
of mineralization in cultures maintained under adipogenic,
chondrogenic, and osteogenic conditions, respectively. How-
ever, osteogenically and chondrogenically induced T-MPCs,
respectively, expressed bone- and cartilage-associated mRNA
transcript markers at a lower level compared with BM-MPCs.
A number of groups have assessed the influence of age of
MPCs donors, both in vitro and in vivo, on their differentiation
potential. Stenderup and colleagues [33] found no difference
in osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacity between
MPCs from young and old donors. However, an age-related
loss of both chondrogenic and osteogenic potential of MPCs
has also been reported [31,34]. In our study, we did not
observe age-related greater differentiation potential expected
for T-MPCs from young donors. We speculate that the lower
level of expression of particular markers of differentiation could
be the result of prior in vivo exposure of T-MPCs to high con-
centrations of inflammatory cytokines, which are characteristi-
cally present in this type of tissue source [35]. In this study, all
T-MPCs were obtained from patients undergoing tonsillec-
tomy as a result of chronic tonsillitis. Chronic bacterial infec-
tion in the tonsils results in the production of local antibodies,
a shift of B- and T-cell ratios, and production of large amounts
of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-
alpha (TNF-α). Recently, the addition of TNF-α to human
MPCs was shown to suppress the osteogenic medium-
induced morphological change from spindle to cuboidal shape
and also ALP enhancement. [36]. To address this issue, we
are currently analyzing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine
in T-MPC culture medium. In support of our theory that expo-
sure to pro-inflammatory cytokines suppressed the differentia-
tion capacity of T-MPCs, passage 5 T-MPCs showed
significantly enhanced differentiation potential for all three lin-
eages when compared with passage 2 cells of the same
patients; this characteristic is contrary to what is observed
with BM-MPCs (that is, reduced differentiation capacity is
seen with increasing passage number). We speculate that
increased passaging not only eliminates tissue-plastic adher-
ent inflammatory cells (monocytes), but also aids in reducing
pro-inflammatory cytokine production by cells outside their
original environment that might suppress differentiation.
Recently, MPCs have been shown to display immunosuppres-
sive properties both in vitro and in vivo [10,30,37,38]. MPC

or non-specific mitogenic stimuli [30,37] affects the expres-
sion of activation markers, antigen-specific proliferation (both
for naive and memory T cells), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
formation, IFN-γ production by Th1 cells, and interleukin-4 pro-
duction by Th2 cells. [39,40]. The ability to decrease IFN-γ
production, characteristic of the potent suppressive effect of
MPCs on T-cell proliferation, is present but less pronounced
for T-MPCs compared with BM-MPCs. This finding corrobo-
rates with the relatively reduced suppression of IFN-γ, a meas-
ure of the proliferative activity of the T-cell population in the
assay in the presence of T-MPCs versus BM-MPCs. Interest-
ingly, it was recently reported that IFN-γ level affects MPC
function; that is, the dual roles of MPCs as antigen-presenting
cells or as immune-suppressor cells depend on IFN-γ levels.
Chan and colleagues [41] showed that the antigen-presenting
characteristic of MPCs occurs within a narrow window of IFN-
γ level (10 U/mL), whereas at 100 U/mL of IFN-γ, MPCs are
immunosuppressive. Though speculative, our observations are
consistent with the reported low level of IFN-γ (25.6 ± 7.9 IU/
mL; P < 0.05) produced by tonsillar mononuclear cells com-
pared with the level recorded in the BM sera (41 ± 23 IU/mL;
P < 0.001), which could explain, in part, the different immuno-
suppressive characteristics between BM-MPCs and T-MPCs
[42-44].
While the immunosuppressive mechanisms of MPCs remain
to be clarified, mediation by soluble factors, such as IFN-γ, is
strongly suggested. First, it was reported that MPCs immuno-
suppressed peripheral blood CRTH2-CD4+ T cells that pro-
duce IFN-γ, but did not affect the proliferation of purified
CRTH2+CD4+ T cells unable to produce IFN-γ [13,45]. Fur-
thermore, fetal MPCs, normally non-immunosuppressive in an
MLR, when exposed to IFN-γ for 7 days, inhibit lymphocyte
proliferation at a magnitude similar to that seen with adult
MPCs. [38,46,47]. IFN-γ induction of the suppressive effect of
MPCs on cell proliferation has been suggested to be related
in part to the enhancement of IDO activity [12,13]. IFN-γ/
receptor binding leads to subsequent endocytosis and IFN-γ
nuclear localization sequence (NLS)-guided binding to the
IFN-γ-activated sequence (GAS) response element in the pro-
moter region of IFN-γ-activated genes, such as IDO. [48]. This
pathway involving IFN-γ, IFN-γR, and IDO is supported by a
study showing complete abrogation of the suppressive poten-
tial of MPCs and the ability of IFN-γ to stimulate IDO activity
upon treatment with a neutralizing antibody to IFN-γR. [13].
Furthermore, the response to IFN-γ is related and proportional
to the level of its receptor; that is, increased IFN-γR expression
results in increased IFN-γ signaling and enhanced IDO gene
activation. [49]. Our findings are thus consistent with these
reports in that the less pronounced immunosuppressive activ-
ity of T-MPCs compared with BM-MPCs is associated with a
significant fourfold lower expression of IFN-γR1. Also, treat-
ment with neutralizing antibody to IFN-γR1 completely blocked
the IFN-γ-stimulated IDO activity in BM-MPCs and T-MPCs.
This study suggests, for the first time, a correlation between
IFN-γR1 expression level in MPCs from two different tissue
sources and their immunosuppressive potency.
The secondary lymphoid organs – lymph nodes, spleen, ton-
sils, and Peyer's patches – are the sites where immune
responses against microbes or antigens are initiated. B lym-
phocytes that continuously recirculate through the blood and
secondary lymphoid organs to encounter antigens or that
specifically recognize and respond to antigens located in the
tonsils become activated and undergo clonal expansion and
somatic hypermutation, leading to differentiation into memory
and plasma cells. [50]. The identification of MPCs in tonsils
raises interesting questions about their immunosuppressive
functions and their effects on B-cell biology in this lymphoid
organ. Few studies have addressed the effects of BM-MPCs
on B-lymphocyte functions. It has been reported that MPCs
inhibit B-lymphocyte proliferation [51-53] and that this activity
requires soluble factors [54] such as IFN-γ. [13]. It is notewor-
thy that B-cell differentiation requires a close association with
stromal cells [55,56], and MPCs have been recently shown to
give rise to a fully functional population of B-cell supportive
fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) [57], found associated with
the follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) within secondary lymphoid
organs, where they play a key role in the initiation and mainte-
nance of efficient immune response. FDCs have been sug-
gested to differentiate from stromal precursors of
mesenchymal origin upon interaction with lymphotoxin α1β2
produced by activated B cells. [58]. BM-MPCs have also been
shown to acquire a complete FRC phenotype in response to a
combination of TNF-α and lymphotoxin-α1β2 [57]. The impor-
tance of environmental influences, particularly those related to
inflammation, on the immunosuppressive properties of MPCs
has been previously stated. [59]. Indeed, the controversy con-
cerning modulation of B-cell functions by MPCs may reflect
the differentiation state of MPCs (that is, into FRCs or FDCs)
and/or may be the result of microenvironmental signals. Thus,
MPC effects on the immune system are modulated not only by
cell-to-cell interactions, but also by environmental factors that
shape their phenotype and their functions. Accordingly, the
functional differences between BM-MPCs and T-MPCs, nota-
bly their immunosuppressive potency, most likely reflect their
previous environment in situ.
MPCs appear to bypass immune rejection, thus making them
attractive candidates for allogeneic transplantation. However,
in vivo, the behavior of the transplanted MPCs is expected to
be influenced by their exposure to immune cells and media-
tors. Another challenging consideration for the clinical use of
MPCs and notably T-MPCs, which are isolated from tonsil tis-
sue frequently infected and infused with inflammatory media-
tors, is to predict how the host tissues will affect the properties
of the MPCs. Future studies are necessary to better
understand the impact of the inflammatory microenvironment
on MPCs for their application in transplantation protocols.

Conclusion
The issues mentioned above are central to the use of alloge-
neic MPCs in therapeutic applications. Accordingly, there is
recent emphasis on the search for alternative sources of
MPCs. Based on the findings reported here, human palatine
tonsils could be added as another source of MPCs. More
importantly, the presence of MPCs in a secondary lymphoid
organ underscores their potential contribution to a specialized
microenvironment that supports the initiation and the mainte-
nance of efficient immune responses.
