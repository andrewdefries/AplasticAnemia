Abstract
Survival rates following myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in childhood
have improved. We conducted a cross-sectional study evaluating the quality of life (QOL) of 214
adult survivors of a childhood HCT compared to controls using standardized self report measures
with strong psychometric properties to evaluate physical function, psychological function, and
cognitive symptoms. From these results we conducted a multivariate analysis of risk factors. This
analysis for physical functioning showed poorer function among myeloid disease survivors
compared to patients with all other diagnoses (p=0.02), males functioned better than females
(p=0.05) and those >18 years after transplant functioned more poorly than those <18 years after
transplant (p=0.05). Psychological functioning showed those who received more therapy and
females were more likely to be depressed (p=0.03) and (p=0.005). Perceived cognitive symptoms
demonstrated that female survivors had more symptoms than male survivors (p=0.01), and those
receiving more preceding therapy compared to those with less preceding therapy (p=0.001) or
cranial irradiation compared to those without cranial irradiation (p=0.002) had more perceived
cognitive symptoms. Overall, these data indicate the majority of adult survivors of a childhood
transplant are functioning well, but some have problems which need to be addressed.

INTRODUCTION
Survival rates after myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have improved
considerably during the past 30 years. There is a growing population of survivors, and in
particular individuals who received their HCT when they were children. These patients
make up a unique group about whom few previous studies have been performed evaluating
their health related quality of life (QOL) as they are surviving into adulthood. QOL is
defined as a multi-dimensional construct encompassing physical, mental and social well-
being.1 Improved understanding of these individuals’ QOL will facilitate more accurate
informed consent, permit better planning by parents, patients, and medical providers, and
enable the design of interventions to improve outcome for future patients.

The late effect medical complications of HCT have been well described and for children
include chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), recurrent infection, diabetes mellitus,
pulmonary function abnormalities, growth and development issues, recurrent malignancy
and development of secondary malignancy.2–9
Studies conducted on the QOL of adult survivors of adult transplants have yielded
contradictory results. While some studies of adult transplant survivors indicate that these
individuals are relatively unaffected at late follow-up, others report a wide variety of
problems, including low energy levels and sleep difficulties, physical limitations, sexual
difficulties, psychological distress and impaired social relationships.10–12 Some have
attributed this disparity in findings to differences in methodology and sampling.13 Some of
these studies, however, show that age at transplant is important with younger adult
transplant recipients doing better. Higher total body irradiation (TBI) dose seems to be
related to poorer sexual, cognitive, and physical functioning. After the first year time post
transplant does not seem to influence psychosocial status, functional QOL and affective
status. Fatigue, psychological distress and sexual dysfunction are the most frequently
reported symptoms after transplant.10,14
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the quality of life of a large number of
adults who received their transplant as a child 5 or more years previously. Based on previous
research the hypotheses were that a) the majority would not have physical limitations that
disrupted their activities of daily living, and, b) these individuals would report impaired
social function, but the majority would be psychologically without major impairments, and
c) the majority of these adults would not self-report cognitive difficulties. Therefore, we
conducted a cross-sectional study evaluating the QOL of all available adult survivors of
transplants that took place at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center when the
individual was less than 18 years old. The objective was to determine the extent to which
these individuals are at risk for ongoing issues with physical limitations, psychosocial
issues, and cognitive symptoms based on demographic or treatment factors. Results were
compared to a gender and age matched control cohort.
METHODS
Participants and Procedures
All 334 potentially eligible participants had to be able to speak, read, or write English
adequate to complete patient reported outcome questionnaires. Eligible patients were 5 years
or more after HCT, were less than 18 years of age at the time of HCT and were now more
than 18 years of age and without any evidence of their original disease. All diagnoses, all
preparative regimens and all donor types were included. Diagnosis categories were
considered based on the similarity of the treatment received prior to transplant and the type
of transplant preparative regimen received. Lymphoid disease category included patients
with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin
Disease (HD) because the majority of these patients were beyond first remission at the time
of transplant and had similar transplant preparative regimens. Myeloid disease category
recipients were grouped together because the majority of patients were early in the course of
their disease, including patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) was considered
separately because the disease is treated differently from acute leukemia prior to transplant.
Similarly, the majority of the non-malignant disease category patients had aplastic anemia
and all received similar or the same preparative regimen. Patients were further categorized
by relatively how much disease specific therapy had been administered prior to transplant.
Those categorized as “less” therapy included non-malignant disease patients, CML in
chronic phase, and those with acute leukemia in first remission. Those patients categorized

as “more” therapy included all of those patients beyond first remission or beyond chronic
phase. Among the 334 eligible patients, 13 were lost to follow-up or were living overseas
and contact was prohibited for one patient. A total of 320 eligible survivors were contacted
of whom 289 indicated they were willing to participate. Among these 67 did not return data
leaving a population of 222 who participated in the study.
The control subjects were gender matched with the survivors and were within 5 years of the
survivors’ age. The controls were a sibling or friend of the survivor who met the age and
gender criteria. Use of siblings as controls is the standard control also used by the Childhood
Cancer Survivorship Study.15 Since they are not ideal in that influences of the HCT
experience cannot be ruled out, when available, population norms are also reported and
compared. The protocol and questionnaires were approved by the Institutional Review
Board prior to initiation of the study. The survivors and controls were contacted by phone by
the study coordinator who explained the study and asked if the packet of questionnaires
could be mailed to them. Implied consent was obtained by the survivors’ and controls’
completion of the questionnaires and returning them to the study coordinator in the provided
self-addressed envelopes. Medical records provided details regarding the survivor diagnosis,
treatment regimens, type of HCT donor, history of acute and chronic GVHD and survival.
Measures
Patient-reported outcomes have established reliability in medical and non-medical
populations including HCT survivors. Standard self-report questions asked about age,
gender, ethnicity, race, education, and income. Respondents indicated whether specific
diseases had been diagnosed and how severe the specific health problem was using ratings
of none, mild, moderate or severe. Active diseases and problems were noted and reported.
Three aspects of QOL were investigated: physical functioning, psychosocial functioning,
and cognitive symptoms. Standardized scales or measures with strong psychometric
properties were used to measure QOL. Physical functioning was measured using the
Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF36). Psychosocial functioning
was evaluated using the depression and anxiety subscales of the Symptoms Checklist 90-R,
16 the Satisfaction with Life Roles,17 the Family Relations Index (FRI),17 and Social
Support Questionnaire Short Form (SSQSR).18 Cognitive symptoms were measured using
the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale (NBRS)19 and the Modified Memory Questionnaire
(MMQ).20
Physical Capability—The SF-36 is a widely used QOL measure that provides a non-
disease-specific measure of adult functioning and well being, allowing for comparison with
a broad range of same-aged norm groups including those of an age and gender-matched
healthy population.21 The eight subscales measure the physical functioning, role limitations
due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health, social
functioning, and role limitations due to emotional health. Two summary scores are also
calculated from the subscales, a physical component score (PCS) and a mental component
score (MCS).
Psychosocial functioning—The SCL-90-R is a standardized, multidimensional self-
report inventory of psychological symptoms with norms available for a large sample of
nonpsychiatric adults. The scale has extensive reliability and validity testing and has been
used in HCT survivors.10 FRI17 measures the quality of social relationships in the family. It
includes subscales that comprise the relationship domains of Cohesion, Expressiveness, and
Conflict along with the total score. This is a widely used, reliable and valid measure used in
oncology as well as non-medical research. The Life Satisfaction scale was developed to

assess the impact of HCT on roles such as family, home, and work. Respondents are asked
to rate their satisfaction from 0 = not at all to 10 = extremely well for 10 aspects of family,
home, and work roles, including parent, spouse, homecare, worker, and student as well as
appreciation of life and religious or spiritual participation. The score is the mean response of
those items that are applicable to the individual. Internal consistency reliability with the full
cohort in this study is alpha = .86. Validity is supported by correlations with the SF-36
mental health subscale of r = .57 and with the FRI total score of r = .40. The SSQSR18
inventory of social support is one of the most broadly used brief measures of social support
designed to measure perceived social supports and satisfaction with available support.
Cognitive symptoms—The NBRS measures self-observed alertness, distractibility,
intrusion of irrelevant thoughts, coherence of conversion, anxiety, tension, disinhibitory
behavior, motor behavior and expressive/receptive language ability. The MMQ is a self-
report test of everyday memory. The measures provide assessment of perceived deficiencies
verbal recall and learning and provide an assessment of memory deficiencies.
Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 12.0 and SAS Version 8. Scores were
examined for outliers and normality of distribution. No transformations were performed.
Chi-square tests and Student’s t-tests were used to compare demographic and clinical
variables as well as QOL scores between the survivor and control groups and survivors vs
QOL score population norms where available. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to
adjust the latter comparisons for age and gender, and to perform multivariate analysis
(MANOVA) of factors influencing QOL outcomes among survivors. Demographic and
treatment variables considered in the analyses included diagnosis group lymphoid
malignancy [acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Hodgkin Disease (HD), non-Hodgkin
Lymphoma (NHL)] vs. myeloid malignancy [acute myelogenous leukemia (AML),
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)] vs. chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) vs non-malignant disorders [aplastic anemia (AA), red cell
aplasia, Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome], preparative regimen TBI vs no TBI, pre-transplant
cranial irradiation, clinical extensive chronic GVHD, scleroderma and/or contractures, age at
transplant, age at study participation, time post-transplant, gender, prior therapy (more vs
less), donor type (autologous, matched vs mismatched), and second transplant.
RESULTS
Among the 222 participating survivors transplanted April 1972 through November 1994
(69% of eligible, approached participants), eight were excluded because of unusual
preparative regimens or diagnoses, leaving a total population of 214 included in the analysis.
The population included was similar in distribution to the total number of patients
transplanted during this time period. The survivors were a mean of 28.7 years of age (range
18.8–45.9 years). Ninety-six were female and 118 were male. There were 194 who were
Caucasian and 20 who were non-Caucasian. There were no differences between participants
and non-participants with respect to gender, diagnosis, cranial irradiation, having received
TBI, race and time post-transplant. Participant’s age at transplant was 11.9 (range: 1.8–17.9)
years of age compared to non-participant age at transplant of 10.4 (range: 1.5–17.9) years of
age (p = 0.005). Among the participant’s there were more females (47%) than males
compared to non-participant’s where females were 32% compared to males (p = 0.01).
Among the participants there were fewer non-white race individuals (9%) than among the
non-participants (19%) (p = 0.01). For all other comparisons between the participants and
non-participants there were no differences in age at diagnosis, time from diagnosis to

transplant, diagnosis at transplant, cranial irradiation, transplant preparative regimen, acute
and chronic GVHD and donor type as well as age at study.
Among the 197 controls, the mean age was 28 years (range 18–51 years). There were 105
females and 92 males and 178 Caucasians and 19 non-Caucasians. Among controls, the 120
siblings were not statistically different from the 77 non-siblings in terms of gender,
ethnicity, race, educational status, full time work or school, financial situation or marital
status. The control siblings were a mean of 29 years of age and the control non-siblings were
26.4 years of age (p = 0.005). Siblings did not differ from non-sibling controls in any of the
outcomes reported. Transplant characteristics of the survivors are shown in Table 1. Among
these survivors, 148 (69%) received HCT for a type of leukemia and 31% had a non-
malignant disease. Prior to transplant, 21% of survivors had received 18.0–24.0 Gy cranial
irradiation. The time between the survivor’s diagnosis and the HCT was a mean of 1.4
(range: 0.1–11.4) years. The transplant preparative regimen included 12.0–15.75 Gy
fractionated TBI for 51% of the survivors. Acute and chronic GVHD were problems for
48% and 28% of the survivors respectively. The average time after transplant patients were
studied was 16.2 (range: 5.2–28.9) years, and the average age when the patients were
studied was 28.7 (range: 18.8–45.9) years.
Comparisons between survivors and controls
Physical Function—This was measured by SF-36 PCS. Higher scores indicate better
functioning with a population mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. In all instances the
control participants had significantly better functioning as indicated by higher scores (Table
2). Although survivors did not differ from population norms (50.0 vs 51.1) when comparing
the survivors with the controls, the controls functioned significantly better than the
transplanted survivors on the PCS as indicated by higher scores (55.1 vs. 51.1, p = 0.001).
With respect to the physical sub-scales of the SF-36 including physical function, role
physical, bodily pain and general health, the transplant recipients were significantly worse
than the control groups (Table 2).
Psychological Function—This was measured by the SF-36 mental component score
(MCS) and mental health sub-scales, Life Satisfaction as well as SCL-90-R depression and
anxiety sub-scales. For the SCL-90-R scale, higher scores indicate worse functioning, but
for the SF-36 and Life Satisfaction scales, higher scores indicate better functioning. In
overall MCS survivors did not differ from controls or from population norms. On the SF-36
MCS sub-scales (mental health, vitality, social function, and role emotional), the control
subjects had higher scores than the survivors, but none were statistically significant (Table
2). For the SCL-90-R scales for depression, the survivors were more likely to be depressed
(p = 0.03) than the control subjects and trended toward having more anxiety (p = 0.07).
However, survivors were more likely to have greater satisfaction with their role in life (p =
0.01) than controls.
Family Relationships—This was measured by the Family Relations Index (FRI) looking
at the subscales of cohesion, expression, conflict and total relationship. In no instance was
there a significant difference between the transplant recipients and the controls (data not
shown).
Cognitive Symptoms—This was assessed by the NBRS and MMQ. On the NBRS and
MMQ scales, higher scores indicate more symptoms, and on the RS cognitive scale, higher
scores indicate fewer symptoms. When transplant survivors were compared with controls,
the MMQ (0.55 vs 0.53) overall were not significantly different from each other (p = NS and

NIH-PAAuthorManuscriptNIH-PAAuthorManuscriptNIH-PAAuthorManuscript
p = NS) (Table 2). The NBRS patient scores indicated more cognitive symptoms than
controls (1.64 vs. 1.28, p = 0.01).
Overall Comparison of Quality of Life—The data for this evaluation is shown in Table
2 in the QOL domain and number of QOL problems. Overall, 70% of the transplant
survivors had no QOL problems compared to 74% of controls (p = 0.04).
Risk Factor Analysis among Survivors
Physical Functioning—Table 3 shows the results of multivariate analysis for
demographic and treatment risk factors which had an apparent association with either
outcome. Other factors included in the analysis but not significant include preparative
regimen, cranial irradiation, chronic GVHD, age at transplant, age at study participation, and
second transplant (data not shown). There were differences in physical function based on
patient diagnosis with patients with Lymphoid Malignancy and CML functioning the best
and those with myeloid malignancy having the poorest physical functioning. All other
measures of physical function were not significant
Psychological Function—Table 4 shows the results of the multivariate analysis for
psychological function risk factors which had an apparent association with any of the
outcomes. Other factors included in the analysis but are not significant include preparative
regimen, cranial irradiation, chronic GVHD, age at transplant, age at study participation,
donor type and second transplant (data not shown). In this analysis, the diagnosis did not
play a role in psychological functioning. Patients receiving more therapy before transplant
were more likely to be depressed after transplant and less satisfied with life roles as
measured by the depression scale and the life satisfaction with life scales (p = 0.03 and
0.005 respectively). Females were more likely to have psychological dysfunction MCS (p =
0.01) and depression (p = 0.005) scales and more anxious as measured by the anxiety scale
(p = 0.02) compared to males. The number of years after transplant did not have an effect on
development of anxiety or depression.
Cognitive Symptoms—Table 5 shows the results of multivariate analysis for risk factors
which had an apparent association with any of the outcomes. Other factors included in the
analysis, but were not significant include preparative regimen, chronic GVHD, age at study
participation, donor type and second transplant (data not shown). There were no differences
in perceived cognitive symptoms with respect to diagnosis for the MMQ or NBRS
measures. Among patients receiving more therapy MMQ and NBRS were all significantly
impacted among those who had received more therapy. Among those who had received
cranial irradiation prior to transplant only self reported memory as measured by the MMQ
was significantly impacted, but self reported cognitive function as measured by NBRS was
not significantly impacted. Females had more symptoms than males on both the MMQ and
transplant age of <13 years appeared to result in more cognitive symptoms with the MMQ
only.
Social Relationships, Education and Insurance
More survivors than controls reported that they were living with their parents (25% of
patients and 12% of controls, p = 0.001). Few in both groups, but more survivors, reported
that they had never dated (5% of survivors and <1% of controls, p = 0.007). More patients
than controls indicated that they had never married or had a live-in partner (43% of patients
and 32% of controls, p = 0.04). A majority of both groups were married or cohabitating.
There were 57% of patients and 54% of controls who were currently married or cohabiting
(p = NS).

NIH-PAAuthorManuscriptNIH-PAAuthorManuscriptNIH-PAAuthorManuscript
In considering education, 14% of patients and 4% of controls noted that they were in special
education classes during school (p = 0.001). The reasons for the special education classes
were not explored. In school achievement, however, a grade point average of less than 3.0
was earned by 41% of patients and 40% of controls (p = NS) and 52% of patients and 58%
of controls completed 2-year college or trade school or further education (p = NS). At the
time of assessment, 82% of the patients and 91% of the controls were working fulltime,
were in school full time or were full time homemakers (p = 0.001). More survivors than
controls depended upon family or the government for financial support (15% of survivors
and 6% of controls, p = 0.002), with the remainder being self sufficient.
Health insurance had been denied to 18% of transplant patients and 2% of controls (p =
0.001), but 12% and 14% respectively did not have health insurance (p = NS). The source of
health insurance was mainly from the employer (46% transplant patient, 50% control, p =
NS) and from spouse or parent (24% transplant patient, 27% control, p = NS). Life
insurance was obtained by 57% of patients and 60% of controls (p = NS).
DISCUSSION
This study provides information about the largest cohort of adults reported to date who
received an HCT as a child with a median follow-up of 16 years. The transplant patients
report functioning as well as non-transplant controls on various aspects of QOL, although
survivors were more likely than controls to report continuing difficulties in physical
functioning and depression. Reasons for greater functional difficulties in some survivors are
not entirely clear and cannot be entirely related to the degree of transplant complications,
especially chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or prior therapy received by this
population. Consistent with findings of adult survivors of HCT, female survivors of
pediatric transplants had more psychological difficulties.22
The participants and non-participant transplanted recipient groups were similar in most
aspects, but differed significantly with respect to the age at transplant (mean 11.9 years vs
10.4 years), gender (females 47% vs 32%) and race (non-white 9% vs 19%). Participant bias
may have been a factor in the risk factor analysis where gender was a significant factor with
respect to physical functioning, psychosocial functioning, and cognitive symptoms. This
difference in gender distribution with more female participants than male participants may
have influenced the risk factor analysis where more females than males had more cognitive
symptoms, had poorer physical functioning and were more likely to be depressed. If equal
number of males and females had participated, the results of this analysis could have been
impacted. It is unlikely that the mean difference in age at transplant between participants and
non-participants of 1.5 years had any influence on the outcomes measured since age was not
a significant factor in the risk factor analysis. Similarly, it is unlikely that the imbalance
between race of the participants and non-participants was a factor since race was also not a
significant factor.
Physical functioning after transplant was significantly worse in the transplant patients
compared to the controls. The risk factor analysis showed that diagnosis of myeloid
malignancy was a significant risk factor as was having received an autologous transplant.
This suggests that chronic GVHD per se was not a major factor in long term physical
functioning although a few patients with scleroderma reported worse physical function. This
differs from what was observed by others where there was no reported physical impairment,
23 but similar to another study where physical adverse events were seen in the HCT group.
24 A recent Swedish study showed poor satisfaction with physical health.25 Duration of
time after transplant did not predict better or poorer function, but this could be because the
median follow-up time was 16 years and our study was not designed to be sensitive to early

post-transplant changes in physical stamina and return to regular life activities. Syrjala, et al.
observed in adults that it took as long as five years before patients were fully functioning at
near pre-transplant levels.14 One study evaluated patient’s physical activity and found that
transplant patients had more restrictions in sports activities and mobility reported and
attributed to disease or treatment sequelae. The transplant patients were more likely to spend
free time in passive activities that required no physical activities.1,23,26,27
As has been observed in the adult transplant population, females were more likely to be
depressed after transplant than males, and patients on average were more depressed than
controls. This may be an extension of the observations that post-transplant teenagers had
more difficulties in coping with themselves and significant others than a control group of
healthy girls.28 Nespoli et al showed that adolescent patients had slightly increased levels of
depression.29 Ness also found more psychosocial difficulties reported by adult survivors of
pediatric transplantation.30 On the other hand, Kupst, et al, found a relative lack of
psychosocial problems,26 and Lof et al found emotional well being and satisfaction with
family similar to norms.25 In our study, patients who had received more leukemia therapy
pre-transplant were subsequently more likely to be depressed. This observation bears
watching in future studies, especially among patients who come to transplant heavily pre-
treated.
In the present study there was no difference among the patients compared to controls in self-
reported symptoms of memory difficulty (MMQ) or in areas of alertness, or ease of
distractibility, but there was poorer expressive/receptive language function (NBRS) among
the transplant recipients compared to the controls. More of the transplant patients needed to
have special education compared to controls, consistent with other reports.30 But ultimately
the patients had grade point averages comparable to the controls and completed trade school
or higher education in similar proportions. More than 80% of patients and 90% of controls
were gainfully employed. In addition, survivors indicated higher levels of life satisfaction
than controls. These findings suggest that overall a large majority of childhood HCT
recipients will function well in school and work-related roles.
Several studies have measured cognitive function. Four studies have shown that either the
pre and post-transplant IQ was stable26 or there were no differences in cognitive functioning
after HCT.31,32 Some studies measured declines in cognitive function for subgroups of
pediatric transplant survivors after transplant out to five years.31,33 While this study did not
test objective neuropsychological function, the results of these patient-reported outcomes
suggest that most patients function as well as controls with respect to cognitive function.
It is gratifying to learn that the majority of pediatric transplant survivors are self-sufficient
adults who are contributing to society. The results documenting a high rate of employment
among the transplanted patients is similar to the observations of others who have found that
up to 95% of transplant survivors were attending school or employed.28
There are several limitations of the current study that may affect the generalization of
findings. First, this was a cross-sectional study in a population of patients accrued over
nearly three decades. During that time the approaches to chemotherapy, the drugs used and
the duration of therapy have changed. Similarly, the approaches to transplantation have
changed including the transplant preparative regimens, the way donors are selected, and the
extent of psychosocial and learning support available to pediatric transplant recipients. All
of these factors may influence the long-term post-transplant QOL among survivors.
Questions can be raised about whether the control cohort is appropriately matched to the
survivors. Bias could have been introduced if patients had multiple eligible candidate
controls and consistently selected a more or less healthy case-match or if siblings introduced

negative psychosocial health bias as a result of having experienced the HCT in a sibling. In
the pediatric situation, the sibling may not yet have been born when the transplant took
place. One could argue that although siblings are excellent controls for biologic outcomes,
their experience of transplant could influence their psychosocial outcomes in a manner not
detected. Other methods of selecting controls include random-digit dialing, not including
siblings in recruitment or having survivors nominate many possible case matched controls
and randomly selecting controls from this sample. We note that the Childhood Cancer
Survivor Study also uses siblings as controls for their survivors.15 We have compared our
results to both matched controls and population norms, where available, and find that
siblings are as healthy as population norms.
In summary, these data suggest that in general adult survivors of a childhood transplant have
a reasonable QOL. Some have physical, psychosocial, and cognitive problems which may be
able to be addressed with survivorship programs that target rehabilitation and education
interventions, and are increasingly accessible to those with unmet needs.34 Most all are
gainfully employed and have insurance. Future studies should address following these
transplanted patients prospectively to learn the pace at which these survivors return to
normal physical and mental health after transplant, to address the problems observed in the
AML patients and to address the depression and anxiety observed among the female
patients. Understanding of these individuals’ QOL needs, based on results of this study and
similar research, will facilitate more detailed informed consent, permit better planning by
parents, patients, and medical providers, and enable the design of interventions to improve
outcomes for future patients.
