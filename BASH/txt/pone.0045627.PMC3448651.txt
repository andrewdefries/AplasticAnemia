Abstract
Introduction: Pesticide poisoning is an important public health problem worldwide. The study aimed to determine the risk
of all-cause and cause-specific inpatient mortality and to identify prognostic factors for inpatient mortality associated with
unintentional insecticide and herbicide pesticide poisonings.
Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 3,986 inpatients recruited at hospitalization between 1999 and
2008 in Taiwan. We used the International Classification of Disease, 9th ed., Clinical Modification external causes of injury
codes to classify poisoning agents into accidental poisoning by insecticides and herbicides. Comparisons in mortality rates
were made between insecticide poisoning patients and herbicide poisoning patients by using the Cox proportional hazards
models to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Results: There were 168 deaths during 21,583 person-days of follow-up evaluation (7.8 per 1,000 person-days). The major
causes of mortality for insecticide poisonings were the toxic effect of organophosphate and coma, and the major causes of
mortality for herbicide poisonings were the toxic effect of other pesticides and the toxic effect of organophosphate. The
mortality for herbicide exposure was fourfold higher than that for insecticide exposure. The factors associated with inpatient
mortality were herbicide poisonings (HR = 4.58, 95% CI 3.29 to 6.37) and receiving mechanical ventilation treatment
(HR = 3.85, 95% CI 2.73 to 5.42).
Conclusions: We demonstrated that herbicides stand out as the dominant agent for poisoning-related fatalities. The control
of and limiting access to herbicide agents and developing appropriate therapeutic regimens, including emergency care,
should be priorities.

Introduction
Pesticide poisoning is a significant public health problem
worldwide. With the development of modern agriculture, patients
are increasingly exposed to new types of insecticides and
herbicides. Currently, the most common type of pesticide in
Taiwan is organophosphate pesticides (OP) [1], and glyphosphate
and paraquat are the two types of herbicides that are used most
frequently [2].
Pesticide exposure in Taiwan was recently evaluated using the
nationwide registry maintained by the network of Taiwan’s Poison
Control Centers (PCC) [3]. Over the course of eight years (1985–
1993), 23,436 telephone calls concerning human poisoning
exposure were recorded. The most frequent cause of poisoning
was pesticides (29.3%). Among all fatal cases, paraquat and
organophosphate exposures were the two leading causes of death
[4]. Another study reported that there were 4799 organophos-
phate pesticide (OP) exposures from July 1985 through December
2006 [1,5]. The fatality rate was 12.7%. These studies were based
on information collected in telephone interviews on the topic of
poisoning exposures. The source population was poorly specified,
and therefore, these figures could not be used to estimate the
incidence of poisoning. Furthermore, previous studies were of
limited sample size and were largely based on one or few health-
care facilities.
The National Health Insurance (NHI) in Taiwan was launched
on March 1, 1995. Since then, medical institutions have been
required by law to make inpatient claims to the NHI Bureau.
Given that Taiwan’s coverage rate is over 99%, the NHI Research
Database provides a representative and evidence-based source of
data for studies in this field. Our understanding of the fatality rate
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e45627
of pesticide poisoning has improved [6]. However, patients
experiencing pesticide poisoning may experience multiple severe
episodes during the same hospitalization or after discharge. Data
on the contribution of subsequent episodes to the disease burden
are still limited because most past studies used overall fatality as
the measured outcome. Furthermore, little information is available
on the inpatient hospital stay of pesticide poisoning patients and
on the survival rates of patients hospitalized for pesticide
poisoning.
During the 10-year period from 1999 to 2008, unintentional
pesticide poisonings accounted for 6,328 hospitalizations in
Taiwan [6]. To address the extent and major agents of exposure
of acute pesticide poisoning in Taiwan resulting in hospitalization,
we obtained data from a nationwide hospitalization database to
determine the rate of all-cause and cause-specific inpatient
mortality and to identify prognostic factors of inpatient mortality
among insecticide and herbicide pesticide poisonings.
Methods
The hospitalization data were retrieved from the NHI Research
Database (NHIRD). Categorization of the poisoning rates, the
causes of hospitalization, and the cause of death after hospitaliza-
tion occurring between 1999 and 2008 was carried out using the
International Classification of Disease, 9th
ed., Clinical Modifica-
tion (ICD-9-CM). This study was conducted using a data base
without patient identifications, thereby conforming to the Decla-
ration of Helsinki.
Patients were categorized into six age groups: infants and
toddlers aged 0–4, children aged 5–14, young adults aged 15–24,
mature adults aged 25–44, middle-aged adults aged 45–64 and
elderly aged 65 or older. We defined unintentional poisoning by
using the ICD-9-CM external causes of injury codes (E-Codes) to
classify poisoning types into accidental poisoning by insecticides of
organophosphate (E863.1) and accidental poisoning by herbicides
(E863.5). Because the most common type of insecticide in Taiwan
is organophosphate insecticide (OP) [1], we excluded patients who
presented with poisoning with organochlorine compounds
(E863.0) (n = 27) or carbamates (E863.2) (n = 97), poisoning by a
mixture of insecticides (E863.3) (n = 170), or poisoning by other
and unspecified insecticides (E863.4) (n = 1197), fungicides
(E863.6) (n = 9), rodenticides (E863.7) (n = 238), fumigants
(E863.8) and other and unspecified agricultural and horticultural
chemicals and pharmaceutical preparations other than plant foods
and fertilizers (E863.9) (n = 508).
The NHI database recorded the status of prognosis after each
hospitalization. Information on death after hospitalization was
obtained from the variable of Trans_code from Inpatient
expenditures by admissions (DD) data file. The operational
definition of death after hospitalization is that the patient dies
during hospitalization or immediately after leaving a hospital in a
critical condition voluntarily. All cause and cause-specific mortal-
ity of inpatients due to unintentional insecticide and herbicide
poisonings were defined by using ICD-9-CM N-Code. Cause-
specific mortality of inpatients due to unintentional insecticide and
herbicide poisonings were further categorized as toxic effect of
organophosphates (989.3)(n = 64), toxic effect of other pesticides,
not elsewhere classified (989.4)(n = 93), anoxic brain damage
(348.1)(n = 1), cardiac arrest (427.5) (n = 1), congestive heart failure
(428.0)(n = 1), pneumonitis due to inhalation of food or vomiting
(507.0)(n = 1), acute respiratory failure (518.81)(n = 1), alcoholic
liver damage, unspecified (571.3)(n = 1), acute renal failure
(584.9)(n = 1), coma (780.01)(n = 2), and toxic effect of unspecified
lead compound (984.9)(n = 2). Overall mortality analyses used
time-to-event methods and were based on 21,583 person-days of
inpatient follow-up evaluation. The person-days of follow-up
evaluation were calculated from the date of hospitalization to
inpatient death or the last date of the inpatient stay. Because the
duration of hospitalization varies, the person-time approach is a
useful way of expressing mortality taking into account differences
in the hospitalization. For patients with multiple hospitalizations,
all hospitalization days were summed. Mortality rates, expressed in
no of deaths per 1000 person-days, were calculated by dividing the
number of deaths by corresponding person time, and survival
curves based on person time were derived by the Kaplan-Meier
method. The log-rank test was used to compare the survival
curves.
Comparisons in mortality rates were made between insecticide
poisoning patients and herbicide poisoning patients by using the
Cox proportional hazards models to estimate multivariable-
adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals
(CIs). The covariates used in the analyses included the following:
type of pesticide poisoning (insecticides/herbicides), age (0–4, 5–
14,15–24, 25–44, 45–64, 65 or older), sex (male/female), Charlson
Comorbidity Index (CCI), living area (northern, central, southern,
eastern, offshore), level of care (medical center, regional hospital,
local hospital), mechanical ventilation treatment (yes/no). ‘‘Cata-
strophic illness’’ meant that patients had one or more following
diseases or injuries: malignant neoplasm, congenital deficiency of
clotting factors, hemolytic or aplastic anemia, renal disease with
renal failure, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis,
rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, vasculitis,
pemphigus, Sjogern’s syndrome, Crohn’s syndrome, ulcerative
colitis, schizophrenic disorders, disorders of metabolism, congen-
ital anomalies, burn of .20% of total body surface, complications
of transplant, acute poliomyelitis with paralysis, injury severity
score §16, used respirator 6 hours per day continue 30 days, a
fully intravenous diet for 30 days, decompression sickness, air
embolism, myasthenia gravis, disorder of immune mechanism,
fracture of vertebral column with spinal cord injury, occupational
disease, cerebrovascular disease with acute stage, multiple
sclerosis, congenital muscular dystrophy, congenital anomalies
integument, leprosy, liver cirrhosis with complications, premature
infants determined to have medium impairments 3 months after
birth, toxic effect of arsenic and its compounds (black foot), motor
neurone disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and rare diseases [7].
To calculate a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), the first five
diagnostic codes (N-Code) of a patient were each multiplied
respectively by the scores assigned to 19 different diseases put forth
by Charlson et al., and the five resultant figures were then totaled
to reach a final index. A higher index was representative of more,
or more serious, accompanying diseases [8]. Statistical significance
was determined by 2-tailed tests (P,0.05). SPSS 18.0 software was
used to conduct the statistical analyses.

other age groups. The mortality rate for herbicide poisoning was
consistently higher than that for insecticide poisoning. The
proportion of patients hospitalized in Central Taiwan was higher
than that of other areas. For patients hospitalized in medical
centers or regional hospitals, the mortality rate was higher than
that of local hospitals. Of the patients, 9.91% (286/2,886) and
7.73% (85/1,100) were treated with mechanical ventilation among
insecticide and herbicide poisonings, respectively. There was a
higher proportion of herbicide poisoning patients (9.45%) who
underwent hemodialysis treatment compared with insecticide
poisoning patients (0.83%). The average hospital stays were 5.5
days and 5.2 days for the insecticide and herbicide poisoning
groups, respectively.
All-cause and cause-specific mortality rates
The all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates for the entire
inpatient cohort separated into the two poisoning groups are
presented in Table 2. There were 168 deaths over 21,583 person-
days of follow-up for an overall death rate, corresponding to 7.8
deaths per 1000 person-days. The all-cause mortality rate for the
herbicide poisoning patients was higher than that of insecticide
patients. The top two causes of mortality for insecticide poisoning
patients were toxic effects of the organophosphates (3.5 per 1000
person-days) and coma (0.1per 1000 person-days); the major
causes of mortality for herbicide poisoning patients were the toxic
effects of other pesticides (16.3 per 1000 person-days) and the toxic
effects of organophosphates (1.4 per 1000 person-days). There
were 89% (93 out of 104) of those who died after herbicide
poisoning, the cause of death is stated as ‘toxic effects of other
pesticides, not elsewhere classified’ that deaths due to herbicides in
general (and including paraquat and glyphosate) are classified in
this category.
Prognostic factors of mortality in pesticide poisoning
patients
As shown in Figure 1, the overall survival for herbicide
inpatients was significantly worse than that for insecticide
poisoning patients (p,0.001). The median survival time of length
of stay for herbicide was 60 days. Table 3 shows the Cox
regression hazard model evaluating cause of poisoning, sex, age,
CCI, living area, level of care, mechanical ventilation treatment
and their association with mortality risk.
Overall, the significant prognostic factors of all-cause mortality
in this population were herbicide poisoning (HR = 4.58, 95% CI
3.29 to 6.37), and receiving mechanical ventilation treatment
(HR = 3.85, 95% CI 2.93 to 6.00). With regard to the level of
medical care, patients hospitalized in medical centers or regional
hospitals had hazards ratios of 1.65 (95% CI 1.00–2.75) times and
1.79 (95% CI 1.09–2.91) times compared with patients hospital-
ized in local hospitals.
Discussion
This was a nationwide population-based study, allowing us to
trace the medical services received by all inpatients after
unintentional poisoning. The cumulative survival rate for herbi-
cide inpatients was significantly worse than that of insecticide
poisoning patients. The mortality rate for herbicide exposure was
almost fivefold higher than that of insecticide exposure. The
factors associated with inpatient mortality were herbicide poison-
ings, level of medical care, receiving ventilation and hemodialysis
treatment.

Cause-specific mortality and prognostic factors
The high mortality rate for herbicide poisoning was in
concordance with previous reports [3,9]. One study that recruited
various poisoning patients through emergency departments in
Southern Taiwan showed that herbicides caused the highest
fatality rate [9]. Paraquat and glyphosate were found to be the
most frequent herbicides involved in fatalities.
Hemodialysis is one among the treatments for paraquat
poisoning [10], as a consequence, much more patients suffered
from severe herbicide poisoning in this study received hemodialysis
therapy. It has been shown that patients exposed to glyphosate
through oral ingestion died more frequently than patients exposed
via other pathways. Shock and respiratory failure accounted for
most fatalities [4]. Intubation and mechanical ventilation are
essential treatment for the most severe poisoning cases [11].
Clinical features such as the development of respiratory distress,
impaired consciousness, pulmonary edema, shock, arrhythmias,
renal failure requiring hemodialysis and the presence of infiltrate
on chest x-ray were some parameters associated with poisoning-
related fatality for glyphosate poisoning patients [11]. In addition,
hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are two elimination methods
used to treat paraquat poisoning patients, but these treatments are
unlikely to change the clinical course. The case-fatality rate is quite

high despite different variations in treatment [10]. Our finding is
consistent with above reports that hemodialysis treatment is
associated with a high herbicide poisoning fatality rate. Death
among organophosphate poisoning patients is chiefly related to
respiratory failure, central nervous system depression, seizures or
ventricular arrhythmias. The pathogenesis of respiratory distress
and failure was related to excessive bronchial secretions,
bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia and
paralysis of respiratory muscles. This association might explain
that ventilation treatment is another indicator of serious compli-
cations of organophosphate and herbicide poisonings.
With regard to the level of medical care, patients hospitalized in
medical centers or regional hospitals had hazards ratios 1.65 times
or 1.79 times compared with patients hospitalized in local
hospitals. We found that only 29% and 50% of patients were
transferred to a higher level of medical service among insecticide
and herbicide poisonings, respectively. The primary hospital might
have lacked of medication, equipment, or staff [12]. The level of
medical care used in our study represented only the most recent
hospitalization. Our results could be influenced by the fact that
higher medical care facilities are prone to an over-representation
of severe poisoning cases. For poisoning by highly toxic pesticides
such as paraquat, patients transferred to a higher level of medical
service might not experience better outcomes.
It is critically important to know exactly the type of chemical
involved in a pesticide poisoning. However, further information on
the specific type of pesticide within the categorization of
organophosphate or herbicide was not available. Currently,
organophosphate insecticides are the most common type of
insecticides in Taiwan including Disulfoton,Terbufos, Azinphos-
Methyl, Mevinphos, Methidathion, Demeton-S-Methyl, Metha-
midophos, Phorate, Dicrotophos, Trichlorfon. There were cate-
gorized on the basis of the WHO pesticide hazard classification
[13] as moderately hazardous to extremely hazardous classes.
Paraquat and glyphosphate are two types of herbicides that are
used most frequently in Taiwan [14].
Intentional vs. non-intentional
Lin et al. (2008) reported that adults experienced more
intentional OP exposures (67%) and that ingestion was the most
common route of exposure (74.5%) based on the network of
Taiwan’s Poison Control Centers (PCC). Lee et al. (2008) reported
a similar proportion (66.1%) of poisoning exposures involving
suicidal intent. However, our study included only pesticide
poisoning hospitalizations in which the poisoning was non-
intentional.
There was a large variation in the case fatality rate among
pesticide poisonings, ranging from 0% to 42%. Even for the same
chemical and/or World Health Organization (WHO) toxicity
classification of pesticides and for those used for similar
agricultural indications, a marked variation in lethality was
observed [15]. Patients can come into contact with toxic
substances intentionally or by accident. Unlike the situation in
which a substance is deliberately administered, in accidental
exposure cases, there is usually only a poor understanding of the
pesticides to which a subject is exposed, both in a qualitative and a
quantitative sense.
In addition, the occurrence and magnitude of harmful effects
and the part of the patients’ bodies in which these effects arise
depend on the form in which the patients are exposed to the
pesticides. The form of exposure is determined by the environ-
mental compartment in which the victim exists, the physical state
of the pesticide (gas or liquid), the physicochemical prosperities of
the pesticide (soluble in water or not) and the nature of contact
(single or prolonged). Furthermore, whether a pesticide is
absorbed, and at what rate, is determined by the barriers that
are encountered along the route of entry into the body.
For 8 persons categorized as herbicide poisoning, the cause of
death was indicated as ‘toxic effects of organophosphates for 93
(out of the 104 deaths) as ‘toxic effects of other pesticides, not
elsewhere classified’. This could be explained either by misclas-
sification of the type of poisoning and/or cause of death as well as
by the presence of two types of substances, a herbicide and
organophosphate. It has been previously reported that glyphosate
herbicide poisoning patients received atropine or pralidoxime

Unintentional Pesticides Poisonings on Mortality

therapy [4,16] even though atropine and pralidoxime are not
antidotes for glyphosate poisoning. These reports imply that some
physicians confuse glyphosates with organophosphates.
Limitations
Several limitations need to be considered in the interpretation of
our findings. First, no further information on the specific type of
pesticide within the categorization of organophosphate or
herbicide was available, and no information was available about
the exposure route and the amount of exposure. Second,
hospitalization data have an over-representation of severe
poisonings and severe symptoms because of self-selection to the
hospital policlinics as well as admission to the hospital care. The
quality of diagnostic practice and criteria for hospitalization may
vary and it is possible that pesticide poisoning is under-reported in
Taiwan.
Third, the comorbidity diagnoses, which rely completely on the
claims data reported by the physicians or hospitals, may be less
accurate than if all individuals had been assessed using a single
standardized procedure [17]. Health professionals may not receive
much training in environmental toxicology or pesticide poisoning.
The signs and symptoms of pesticide poisoning often resemble
those of more common conditions, which may be diagnosed
preferentially. The NHIRD used discharge diagnoses provided by
treating physicians; no standardized criteria were used to define
hospitalization cases. This lack of standardization increases the
probability for case misclassification. The NHIRD, designed as an
administrative dataset, does not include some important individual
characteristics for further analyses such as smoking and alcohol
consumption, all of which may contribute to death or hospital-
ization. The mortality and hospitalization rates may be underes-
timates because of the possible under-reporting of cases in the
databases used in the analyses. Administrative databases are
known to be subject to possible undercoding and overcoding
errors [18]. The difficulty of receiving reimbursement through
workers’ compensation may also bias health care providers’
diagnoses and the reporting of episodes of unintentional pesticide
poisoning. The health care professionals may fear that their
patients may be subject to retaliation.
Strengths of this study
Litchfield [19] categorized studies on acute pesticide poisoning
in agriculture into three categories: clinical case reports, descrip-
tive epidemiology studies, and cross-sectional studies. Several
studies conducted in China, India, and Taiwan have been
centered on hospital-based case reports [1,3,9,20,21]. These
reports included insufficient information on the source population
to estimate the poisoning rates. A particular strength of the current
study is the use of a nationwide population-based dataset, allowing
us to trace the medical services received by all patients after
poisoning. Large computerized databases derived from this system
by the Bureau of National Health Insurance, Taiwan (BNHI) and
maintained by the National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan,
are provided to scientists in Taiwan for research purposes.
NHIB established a uniform system to control the quality of
medical services and coding. Chou et al. (2003) reported the
accuracy of the comorbidity in the claims data using medical
records as the gold standard [22]. The kappa values for all of the
demographic data between two abstractors were greater than
95%. In addition, the kappa values for 18 comorbidities were
more than 84% in inter-abstractor reliability. The agreement of
kappa value of comorbidities between medical records and claims
data were in a range between 0.31 and 0.86. Authors concluded
the validity of comorbidity data in NIH claims data was in the
range of moderate and substantial agreement. Several studies have
been published also supported the strong validity of the NHIRD
[23,24].Using the same ICD-9-CM codes over the study period
maintained the internal validity of the temporal trend analyses.
Except for the limited information of the route of exposure of
pesticide poisoning, the present study is the most complete
nationwide population-based study conducted to assess the risk
of inpatient mortality and to identify some prognostic factors of
inpatient mortality among insecticide and herbicide pesticide
poisonings.
Conclusions
The major causes of mortality for insecticide poisonings were
the toxic effect of organophosphates and coma, whereas the major
causes of mortality for herbicide poisonings were the toxic effect of
other pesticides and the toxic effect of organophosphates. The
factors associated with inpatient mortality were herbicide poison-
ing and receiving further medical treatment; however, we could
not further classify the different substances in the organophosphate
insecticide and herbicide categories. We demonstrated that
herbicides stand out as the dominant agent for poisoning-related
fatalities. From public health perspective, there is an obvious need
to strengthen the efforts to get more information on the details of
herbicides for this database. This would allow identification of the
most hazardous herbicides and could lead to better treatment and
prevention of accidents in the future. Furthermore, the control of
and limiting access to herbicide agents and developing appropriate
therapeutic regimens, including emergency care, should be
priorities. Physicians and general practitioners should be aware
and capable of recognizing these types of poisonings early because
such poisonings are rapidly fatal unless correctly diagnosed and
treated. More research on chronic pesticide exposure is also
needed because there is still relatively little known about the health
effects of these types of poisonings.
