Abstract: There is growing evidence that accelerated telomeric attrition and/or aberrant
telomerase activity contributes to pathogenesis in a number of diseases. Likewise, there is
increasing interest to develop new therapies to restore or replace dysfunctional cells
characterized by short telomeric length using telomerase-positive counterparts or stem cells.
While telomerase adds telomeric repeats de novo contributing to enhanced proliferative capacity
and lifespan, it may also increase cellular survival by conferring resistance to apoptosis.
Consequently, we sought to determine the involvement of telomerase for reduced apoptosis
using ovarian surface epithelial cells. We found that expression of hTERT, the catalytic
component of telomerase, was sufficient and specific to reduce caspase-mediated cellular
apoptosis. Further, hTERT expression reduced activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9, reduced
expression of pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins t-BID, BAD, and BAX and increased
expression of the anti-apoptotic mitochondrial protein, Bcl-2. The ability of telomerase to
suppress caspase-mediated apoptosis was p-jnk dependent since abrogation of jnk expression
with jip abolished resistance to apoptosis. Consequently, these findings indicate that telomerase
may promote cellular survival in epithelial cells by suppressing jnk-dependent caspase-
mediated apoptosis.

Introduction
Telomeric attrition is the prevailing model of a molecular clock (Harley et al 1992)
proposed to explain limited cellular proliferation known as the Hayflick limit (Hayflick
1965). Telomeres, the linear ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, consist of specialized
tandem (TTAGGG)n DNA repeats and associated telomeric binding proteins that
serve to protect the ends of chromosomes from recombination, end-to-end fusion
and degradation, thereby maintaining chromosomal integrity (Blackburn 1991).While
telomeres may also be involved in nuclear organization because they attach to the
nuclear matrix (deLange 1992), they are crucial in solving the ‘end replication’
problem (Olovnikov 1975; Harley et al 1992). That is, in normal somatic cells there
is progressive telomeric loss with successive rounds of cellular replication due to the
inability of conventional DNA polymerase to fully elongate linear DNA. Telomeric
shortening continues until replicative senescence or cellular crisis when critically
shortened telomeres no longer effectively stabilize chromosomes and most cells die.
Greatest telomeric shortening has been reported in cells from patients with progeroid
syndromes (Kruk et al 1995; Metcalfe et al 1996) and in epithelial cells (Counter et
al 1992). However, the rates and extents of telomeric loss in vivo (7–150 base pairs/
year) and in vitro (50–200 base pairs/population doubling) are highly variable among
different cell types (Hastie et al 1990; Allsopp et al 1995; Kruk et al 1995; Metcalfe
et al 1996), so that not all cells reach senescent crisis equally.
Clinical Interventions in Aging 2006:1(2)156
Bermudez et al
Occasional immortal cells emerging from crisis usually
contain shortened, but stable telomeres due to the re-
expression of telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein that elongates
telomeric repeats de novo (Kim et al 1994). Consequently,
telomerase suppresses cellular senescence and extends
cellular lifespan (Meyerson et al 1997). Telomerase activity
is generally limited to stem cell populations and
immortalized tumor cells and is suppressed in normal cells
(Kim et al 1994). Telomerase consists of an RNA component
(hTR) that serves as an internal telomeric template and
hTERT, a reverse transcriptase (Kim et al 1994). While both
protein catalytic hTERT and hTR subunits have been
identified and cloned, the protein catalytic subunit is the
limiting determinant of telomerase activity (Feng et al 1995;
Meyerson et al 1997; Weinrich et al 1997; Counter et al
1998). In addition to these two core components, several
telomerase-associated proteins have been identified. They
include the hTR RNA binding proteins TEP1, hnRNP
proteins (A1, C1/C2, D), survival of motor neuron (SMN),
L22, and hStau, while p23 and hsp90 bind hTERT,
suggesting a role for these proteins in hTR RNA processing,
telomerase assembly, and cellular localization of the
telomerase complex (Nakayama et al 1997; Holt, Aisner, et
al 1999; Eversole and Maizels 2000; Ford et al 2000, 2001;
Le et al 2000; Fiset and Chabot 2001; Kamma et al 2001;
Bachand et al 2002). While telomerase regulation is complex
(Ulaner et al 1998; Cong et al 1999; Greenberg et al 1999;
Takakura et al 1999), we have previously developed a culture
model system in which telomerase activity can be perturbed
and controlled in ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cell lines
by endogenous and exogenous stresses (Alfonso-De Matte
et al 2001; Alfonso-De Matte, Moses-Soto, et al 2002;
Alfonso-De Matte,Yang, et al 2002; Alfonso-De Matte and
Kruk 2004).
Although the primary function of telomerase is the
maintenance of structural integrity at the linear ends of
chromosomes contributing to cellular immortalization,
recent studies have shown an association between telomerase
activity and increased chemotherapeutic resistance
consistent with poor prognosis in many cancers (Asai et al
1998; Kiyozuka et al 2000; Villa et al 2000). Telomerase
appears to mediate its protective effect by conferring
resistance to apoptosis (Mandal and Kumar 1997; Kondo et
al 1998; Fu et al 1999, 2000; Tian et al 1999; Zhang et al
1999; Herbert et al 1999; Holt, Glinsky, et al 1999; Iida et
al 2000; Zhu et al 2000), suggesting that the function of
telomerase is more complex than initially thought. However,
the exact mechanism(s) by which telomerase confers
resistance to apoptosis leading to enhanced cellular survival
remains unclear.
Accelerated telomeric erosion and/or aberrant telomerase
activity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many
diseases including: progeroid disorders (Kruk et al 1995;
Metcalfe et al 1996; Du et al 2004); cardiovascular disease
(Oh et al 2001; Serrano and Andres 2004); neurological
disorders (Panossian et al 2003; Zhang et al 2003); and
acquired anemia (Mitchell et al 1999; Vulliamy et al 2001;
Greenwood and Lansdorp 2003; Ohshima et al 2003;
Polychronopoulou and Koutroumba 2004). Given the
growing interest in the potential for progenitor cell therapy
to restore or repair dysfunctional cells by using telomerase-
positive/stem cells to enhance cell survival, we sought to
determine whether telomerase-mediated suppression of
apoptosis contributes to increased cellular survival in
epithelial cells.
Materials and methods
Cell culture and transfections
Normal ovarian surface epithelial cell lines (IOSE-80,
FHIOSE 1816-686, IMCC3, IMCC5) were used as
previously described (Kruk et al 1990, 1999). All cell lines
were previously determined to be telomerase-negative (Kruk
et al 1999). Cells were maintained in Medium 199/MCDB
105 (1:1; Sigma Scientific, St Louis, MO, USA)
supplemented with 10 μg gentamicin (GIBCO BRL, Grand
Island, NY, USA) and 5%–10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Hyclone, Logan UT, USA) in a humidified 5% CO2/95%
air atmosphere. Cisplatin (CP), staurosporine (STS), and
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were employed to induce
apoptosis and were obtained from Sigma Scientific.
Cells were transfected with plasmid constructs of wild-
type (wt) hTERT, dominant-negative (DN) hTERT, jip, or
jnk using the previously described lipofectamine transfection
protocol (Alfonso-De Matte,Yang, et al 2002). Transfections
were confirmed via Western blot analysis. Transfection
efficiency was measured in parallel cultures transfected with
green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA under identical
conditions.
Telomerase assay
To quantitatively detect changes in telomerase, cells were
assayed for telomerase activity using the telomerase
polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (PCR-ELISA; Roche Molecular Biochemicals,
Indianapolis, IN, USA) as described previously (Alfonso-
De Matte et al 2001). Briefly, cells were washed with
Clinical Interventions in Aging 2006:1(2) 157
Telomerase suppresses apoptosis
Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS), trypsinized
and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min. Pellets were washed twice
in DPBS, then resuspended in 200 μl of CHAPS lysis buffer
and kept on ice for 30 min, after which time the lysates were
centrifuged at 100 000 g for 60 min at 4°C. Lysates were
assayed using the Bio-Rad detergent corrected (DC) Protein
Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for determination of
protein concentration following detergent solubilization. In
order to perform the telomerase PCR-ELISA assay within
the linear range, cell extracts equivalent to 2 μg of protein
were used. Following PCR-ELISA, telomerase activity was
detected using a Dynex-MRX plate reader (Dynex
Technologies, Chantilly, VA, USA) and recorded as
absorbance units. The values were expressed as relative
absorbance at 450 nm ± SE.
Telomeric length determination
Telomeric lengths were determined by Southern blot analysis
as described previously (Kruk et al 1995). Briefly, cells were
washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), lysed in
10 mM TrisHCl/1mM EDTA/0.5% SDS/0.1 mg of
proteinase K per ml (Sigma Scientific) at 37°C. DNA was
isolated by standard high salt extraction, treated with 100 μg
RNaseA per ml, and resuspended in 10 mM TrisHCl/ 1 mM
EDTA, pH 7.2. The DNA concentration was determined by
the absorbance at 260 nm. The DNA was digested to
completion with HinfI (1 unit per μg DNA; New England
Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA). DNA (1–2 μg) was loaded
onto 0.5% alkaline agarose gels, resolved by electrophoresis,
transferred to nylon membranes in 1 N NaOH, and
hybridized in Church’s hybridization buffer at 42°C with
(γ-32
P) adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (Dupont/NEN,
Wilmington, DE, USA) end-labeled (TTAGGG)4 (Midland
Certified Reagent Company, Midland, TX, USA).
Membranes were washed in 0.5X saline–sodium citrate
(SSC)/0.1% Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at 42°C, and the
telomeres visualized by autoradiography. Mean telomeric
lengths were calculated using ImageQuant software
(Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) based on
center of mass calculations and expressed in kb ± SE. Mean
telomeric lengths were determined from at least two
autoradiograms from each of three biological experiments.
Cell growth
Cell growth was determined by the MTS colorimetric assay
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The assay was performed
in 96 well microtiter plates as described previously (Johnson
and Kruk 2002) and is based on soluble formazan production
by dehydrogenase enzymes found in metabolically active
cells. Cells were plated at 2.5 x 103
cells per well.
Absorbance was determined at 490 nm using a Dynex MRX
plate reader and the results expressed as the mean absorbance
± SE.
DNA ladders
Cellular apoptosis, as performed previously (Johnson et al
2004), was examined via DNA laddering by electrophoresis
of 1 μg of high salt-extracted DNA on a 2% agarose gels
followed by SYBR green I staining (FMC Bioproducts,
Rockland, ME, USA).
SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis
As described previously, Western blot analysis was
performed to observe changes in members of the apoptotic
cascade associated with telomerase expression (Alfonso-De
Matte, Moses-Soto, et al 2002; Johnson and Kruk 2002;
Johnson et al 2004). Cells were trypsinized, pelleted at 500g
for 5min, lysed in ice cold CHAPS lysis buffer and 15 μg
protein were added to 4X loading buffer (250 mM Tris pH
6.8, 8% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.012% bromophenol blue, 4%
β-mercaptoethanol), electrophoresed in 12.5 % SDS-
polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ,
USA) via semi-dry or wet transfer. All membranes were
blocked for 1 hour with 5% non-fat milk Tris Buffered Saline
plus 0.1% Tween-20 (T-TBS) and incubated overnight at
4°C in primary antibody. Membranes were incubated and
developed according to the Enhanced Chemiluminescent
Protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After initial
blotting, membranes were reprobed for actin to ensure even
loading.All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA, USA).
Statistical analysis
Samples for telomerase PCR-ELISA, MTL, and growth
assays were run in triplicate and the data subjected to Student
t test analysis for determination of statistical significance
between treated and untreated samples.
Results
Telomerase increases mean telomeric
length and cell growth
In agreement with others (Kim et al 1994; Meyerson et al
1997; Weinrich et al 1997; Counter et al 1998; Luiten et al
2003), we found that transfection with hTERT cDNA was

sufficient to activate telomerase expression in ovarian surface
epithelial cells (Figure 1A). Likewise, long-term expression
of hTERT resulted in increased mean telomeric lengths to
levels more than double their telomerase-negative
counterparts (Figure 1B) and indicative of functional
telomerase activity with hTERT transfection. In addition,
cells transfected with hTERT demonstrated increased growth
capacity (Figure 1C). That is, cell yield in hTERT-positive
cells was found to be three times greater than their
telomerase-negative counterparts in short term culture
assays.
Telomerase enhances cell survival
To determine whether telomerase conferred increased cell
survival, IOSE cells ± hTERT cDNA were treated with
25μM cisplatin (CP) for 2 hours and assayed for cell growth.
Cisplatin suppressed cell growth in parental cell lines 50%–
70% of untreated controls (Figure 2A). In contrast, CP was
only able to suppress cell growth in hTERT-positive cells
by approximately 30% (Figure 2A). While increased growth
rates in telomerase-positive cells may contribute to reduced
cytotoxicity, parallel cultures were examined for DNA

IMCC3 and IOSE80 cells were transfected ± hTERT cDNA, treated with 25 μM CP for 2 hr and then assayed for cell growth by MTS (A) or apoptosis by DNA

laddering to determine whether reduced apoptosis
contributed to reduced cytotoxicity in telomerase-positive
cells. In agreement with the cytotoxicity reported above,
IOSE cells demonstrated significant DNA laddering and
fragmentation by 48 hours following treatment with CP
(Figure 2B). In contrast, telomerase-positive cells showed
only marginal DNA laddering by 72 hours following CP,
indicative of reduced apoptosis in telomerase-positive cells.
Telomerase reduces caspase 3-mediated
apoptosis
To determine whether reduced apoptosis in telomerase-
positive cells was caspase 3-dependent, we treated
telomerase-positive and negative IOSE cells with 25μM CP
for 2 hours, 20J/m2
ultraviolet (UV) or 1μM STS for 4 hours
and examined cell lysates for levels of activated (cleaved)
caspase 3 (Figures 3A, 3B). All three agents were able to
induce significant activation of caspase 3 cleavage in
telomerase-negative cells. However, we noted reduced
caspase 3 cleavage by all three apoptosis-inducing agents
in telomerase-positive cells. In addition, some samples were
examined for DFF45, a known cleavage target of caspase 3
to ensure caspase 3 activity (Figure 3A). We found increased
cleavage of DFF45 in telomerase-negative cells compared
with telomerase-positive cells. To ensure that telomerase was
sufficient and specific to reduce caspase 3-mediated
apoptosis, we co-transfected telomerase-positive cells with
a dominant negative (DN) hTERT cDNA to determine
whether inhibition of telomerase restored caspase 3
activation. As expected, DN hTERT suppressed telomerase
Figure 3 Telomerase confers resistance to caspase 3-dependent apoptosis.
IOSE cells transfected ± hTERT cDNA were treated with 25 μM CP for 2 hours, 20J/m2
(A), or 1 μM STS for 4 hours (B), and assayed for activated caspase 3 (17 kDa
and 19 kDa bands) or DFF45 cleavage (45 kDa band) by Western blot analysis. (C) Control IOSE cells, IOSE cells transfected with hTERT, and IOSE cells transfected
with both hTERT and DN hTERT cDNA were treated ± 1 μM STS and examined for telomerase activity by PCR-ELISA.Telomerase activity was expressed as the
absorbance at 450 nm ± SE. Samples from (C) were analyzed by Western immunoblot for activated caspase 3 (D).Actin served as a loading control for all Western
immunoblots.

activity (Figure 3C), but levels of telomerase were unaffected
by STS. When these cultures were examined for caspase 3
activation, DN hTERT was able to restore STS-induced
caspase 3 activation to levels found in control cells while
hTERT alone suppressed caspase 3 activation (Figure 3D).
Telomerase reduces caspase and
mitochondrial apoptotic activation
To identify additional targets of telomerase-mediated anti-
apoptosis, IOSE cells ± hTERT were treated with 1 ng/ml
TNF-α, which induces apoptosis by both the intrinsic and
extrinsic apoptotic pathways. TNF-α did not significantly
alter telomerase activity in telomerase-positive cells (Figure
4A). However, activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9 in
telomerase-positive cells was reduced by up to 50%
compared with their telomerase-negative counterparts
following treatment with TNF-α (Figures 4B–4D).
Likewise, telomerase altered pro- and anti-apoptotic
mitochondrial protein expression. Densitometric analysis
revealed that treatment with TNF-α resulted in up to an 84%
reduction in Bcl-2 levels in telomerase-negative cells, but
up to a 172% increase in Bcl-2 expression in telomerase-
positive cells (Figure 5A), suggesting an anti-apoptotic
tendency in the latter cells. When we examined the samples
for levels of pro-apoptotic proteins, we found that activation
of tBID (by cleavage of BID) was more pronounced in
telomerase-negative cells (Figure 5B). Further, when the
levels of t-BID to Bcl-2 were compared, the ratio of t-BID/
Figure 4 Telomerase-mediated anti-apoptosis is caspase-dependent.
IOSE cells transfected ± hTERT cDNA were treated with 1ng/ml TNF-α for 24 hours and assayed for telomerase activity by PCR-ELISA for up to 72 hours following
treatment (A).Telomerase activity was expressed as the absorbance at 450 nm ± SE. Samples from (A) were also analyzed by Western immunoblot for procaspase 3,
activated caspase 3 (B), cleaved caspase 9 (C), and cleaved caspase 8 (D).Actin served as a loading control for all Western immunoblots. Densitometric analysis of
Western blots is provided in graphical presentation below respective blots.

Bermudez et al
Bcl-2 was more than 7 times greater in telomerase-negative
cells (Figure 5E). Likewise, while BAX levels did not change
significantly during TNF-α treatment course (Figure 5C),
densitometric analysis revealed that BAX levels were
consistently 20%–25% lower in telomerase-positive cells.
When the levels of BAX or BAD to Bcl-2 were compared,
the ratios of BAX/Bcl-2 and BAD/Bcl-2 were up to 30 times
and 8 times greater, respectively, in telomerase-negative cells
indicating an increased propensity for apoptosis in these cells
compared with telomerase-positive cells (Figures 5F, 5G).
In contrast, telomerase did not appear to alter the levels of
the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), XIAP (Figure 5D).
Telomerase-mediated anti-apoptosis is
jnk-dependent
To identify a molecular signaling pathway involved in
telomerase-mediated suppression of apoptosis, we assessed
the contribution of jnk to suppress apoptosis since we found
that induction of apoptosis in telomerase-positive cells was
associated with a 2-fold increase in the levels of
phosphorylated (p)-jnk compared with telomerase-negative
cells (Figure 6A). In contrast, transfection with GFP as a
procedural control was not associated with significant
increases in p-jnk expression since p-jnk levels in GFP-
transfected cells did not differ from untreated cells by more

than 10% (data not shown). Co-transfection with jip, an
inhibitor of jnk, not only reduced levels of p-jnk in
telomerase-positive cells by 25%, but also abolished TNF-
α-mediated induction of p-jnk in these cells (Figure 6B).
Likewise, inhibition of jnk with jip in telomerase-positive
cells restored apoptotic sensitivity as indicated by increased
caspase 3 and 8 cleavage as well as increased levels of tBID/
Bcl-2 following treatment with TNF-α (Figures 6C–6E).
Discussion
Apoptosis, programmed cell death, plays an important role
in many normal and pathophysiological processes and is
triggered when cellular death factors outweigh cellular
survival factors. Aspartic acid-specific cysteine proteases
(caspases), synthesized as zymogens, are the critical
mediators of apoptosis (Cohen 1997). Whether activated by
membrane-bound death receptors (Walczak and Krammer
2000) or by stress-induced mitochondrial perturbation with
subsequent cytochrome c release (Bratton et al 2000;
Loeffler and Kroemer 2000), the respective initiator caspases
8 and 9 function to activate downstream caspases 3 and 7
(Nicholson 1999). Once triggered, caspases lead to stepwise
cellular destruction by disrupting the cytoskeleton, shutting
down DNA replication and repair, degrading chromosomal

DNA, and, finally, disintegrating the cell into apoptotic
bodies (Nagata 2000).
In the present study, several lines of evidence suggest
that telomerase confers resistance to epithelial cell apoptosis.
First, activation of telomerase by transfection with hTERT
resulted in reduced cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity as well
as reduced DNA ladder formation. This is consistent with
previous reports where telomerase activity in primary
cultures of cancer cells was inversely related to
chemosensitivity (Faraoni et al 1999). Similarly, in a pilot
study, Takahashi et al (2000) showed that ovarian cancer
patients responding to platinum therapy had low levels of
telomerase whereas 50% of non-responders demonstrated
elevated telomerase activity. Likewise, reduced apoptosis
in pancreatic cancer cells after exposure to etoposide was
associated with elevated telomerase activity (Sato et al 2000).
Second, ectopic expression of telomerase reduced
apoptosis by suppressing caspase 3 cleavage in OSE cells.
This appears to be the major pathway for telomerase-
mediated resistance to apoptosis and has likewise been
reported by Yamada et al (2003) who showed that
overexpression of hTERT suppressed caspase 3 activity in
K562 hematopoietic cells and Luiten et al (2003) who
showed reduced caspase 3 activation following ectopic
expression of hTERT in T cells. However, there have been
reports of telomerase-mediated resistance to apoptosis
through caspase 3-independent means (Ren et al 2001),
which serves to highlight the potential complexity of
telomerase-mediated resistance to apoptosis. Interestingly,
we also found that telomerase-mediated suppression of
caspase 3 activation occurred in response to a number of
apoptotic insults including CP, UV, and STS. Consequently,
it appears that telomerase may confer global resistance to
apoptosis and may be related to the propensity of many
DNA-damaging agents to target the telomeric TTAGGG
DNA sequence (Ramirez et al 2003).
Third, hTERT expression was sufficient and specific to
confer resistance to apoptosis since co-transfection with
dominant negative (DN) hTERT inhibited telomerase
activity and abolished resistance to apoptosis. Likewise, we
and others have shown that inhibition of telomerase in a
variety of cancer cell types resulted in enhanced drug-
induced apoptosis associated with increased caspase 3
activity (Kondo et al 1998; Kraemer et al 2004; Shoup et al
2004). Consequently, since telomerase re-activation is a
crucial step for cellular immortalization and malignant
transformation, inhibition of telomerase may act as a tumor-
suppressive mechanism and have clinical utility as adjuvant
therapy for enhanced chemosensitization.
Fourth, our data also indicate that telomerase suppresses
an early step in the apoptotic cascade since, in addition to
caspase 3 cleavage, telomerase re-activation suppressed
cleavage of the upstream caspases 8 and 9, but did not affect
levels of the caspase 3 inhibitor, XIAP. Further, we found
that telomerase-mediated resistance to apoptosis was jnk-
dependent because apoptosis associated with ectopic
expression of hTERT resulted in elevated levels of p-jnk
while suppression of jnk expression by jip abolished
resistance to apoptosis. Interestingly, jnk promotes both pro-
and anti-apoptotic functions, dependent upon differential
phosphorylation of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
members. That is, jnk-mediated cleavage of BID to truncated
(t)-BID results in mitochondrial release of cytochrome C
whereas its phosphorylation of BAD at theronine 201
inhibits inactivation of the anti-apoptotic protein, BCL-Xl,
by BAD (Deng et al 2003;Yu et al 2004). In agreement, we
found that re-expression of telomerase resulted in increased
Bcl-2 expression consistent with studies showing that
telomerase activity is higher in colorectal and cervical
cancers expressing high levels of Bcl-2 (Mandal and Kumar
1997; Iida et al 2000). Further, the ratio of pro-apoptotic
proteins tBID, BAD, or BAX/Bcl-2 remained low in
telomerase-positive cells favoring resistance to apoptosis.
Age-dependent telomeric attrition in normal somatic
cells, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells,
cardiomyocytes, lymphocytes, and neurons, impairs cellular
function so that telomeric shortening is thought to contribute
to the pathogenesis of chronic diseases of aging including
heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease (Jeanclos
et al 1998; Halvorsen et al 2000; Oh et al 2001, 2003; Obana
et al 2003; Panossian et al 2003; Zhang et al 2003;
Nakashima et al 2004; Serrano and Andres 2004).
Accelerated telomeric shortening associated with progeroid
and DNA damage repair syndromes, including Werner’s
syndrome, Xeroderma pigmentosum,Ataxia telangiectasia,
and Bloom’s syndrome (Du et al 2004; Kruk et al 1995;
Metcalfe et al 1996; Mondello et al 1997), similarly
contributes to accelerated cellular senescence and reduced
viability. Likewise, aberrant telomerase regulation has been
reported in developmental abnormalities, cancer, and
disorders of the hematopoietic system. Specifically, in
aplastic anemia and Fanconi’s anemia, the mean telomeric
length of peripheral blood cells is considerably shorter than
normal counterparts despite increased levels of telomerase,
Clinical Interventions in Aging 2006:1(2) 165
Telomerase suppresses apoptosis
which is considered a result of high turnover in
hematopoietic stem cells and high rates of telomere breaks
(Greenwood and Lansdorp 2003; Ohshima et al 2003;
Polychronopoulou and Koutroumba 2004). In addition,
autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita is associated
with mutations in the hTR component of telomerase while
X-linked dyskeratosis congenita is due to mutations of
dyskerin, a protein involved in RNA processing and that
also resides within the telomerase complex (Mitchell et al
1999;Vulliamy et al 2001). Telomerase dysfunction in either
form of dyskeratosis congenita results in progressive bone
marrow failure. The potential clinical use of telomerase-
positive cells or stem cells to expand proliferative capacity
and replace damaged somatic cells could reverse or prevent
symptoms associated with progeroid disorders, age-related
diseases, or diseases associated with dysfunctional
telomerase regulation and telomere maintenance. Indeed,
Roy et al (2004) showed that when fetal neuroepithelial cells
were transfected with hTERT and transplanted at sites of
spinal cord injury, they differentiated into functional neurons
and became incorporated into the tissue at the damaged site.
Using TERT transgenic mice, Oh et al (2003) showed that
telomerase expression could delay cardiac myocyte cell
cycle exit and stimulate cardiac hypertrophy. Though further
studies are warranted, our data indicate that restoration of
hTERT expression and telomerase activity in epithelial cells
increases cell survival possibly by conferring resistance to
apoptotic insults important in the pathogenesis of disease.
