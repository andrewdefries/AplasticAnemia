INTRODUCTION
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been
increasingly used to treat patients with malignant, non-mali-
gnant hematologic disorders and severe autoimmune dis-
eases over the last 3 decades (1). Numerous advances have
taken place in the field of HSCT to make the procedure safer.
In addition, better supportive care measures have been incor-
porated into practice, such as hematopoietic growth factors
to accelerate neutrophil recovery, new, more potent antimi-
crobial agents and prophylaxis strategies to prevent infection.
These advances have resulted in better overall outcomes and
have increased the safety of the procedures that in turn enable
more patients to be eligible for HSCT. Despite theses ad-
vances, infectious complications remain a major cause of
transplant related morbidity and mortality (2). There are
several risk factors for infection that still exist in HSCT pati-
ents; the intensity of the conditioning regimen and the type
of HSCT, which influence the development of graft-versus-
host disease (GVHD) and the rate of immune reconstitution
(2, 3).
Recently, HSCT from alternative donors such as matched
unrelated donor (MUD) and mismatched related donors as
well as non-myeloablative HSCT have increased at Catholic
HSCT Center (4). Therefore, a wide range of patients includ-
ing elderly patients, patients with advanced diseases, or with
autoimmune diseases, could have received HSCT. In accor-
dance with the changes in HSCT, infectious complications
following HSCT have changed recently. In the present study,
we analyzed the recent trends of infectious complications and
outcomes following HSCT in a single institution.

Current Trends of Infectious Complications following Hematopoietic
Stem Cell Transplantation in a Single Center
This study was to analyze the infectious complications after hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation (HSCT) according to the recent changes of HSCT. Medical
records of 379 adult patients who underwent HSCT consecutively at Catholic HSCT
Center from January 2001 to December 2002 were reviewed retrospectively. Allo-
geneic HSCT accounted for 75.7% (287/379) and autologous HSCT for 24.3%
(92/379). During pre-engraftment period, bacterial infection was predominant, and
E. coli was still the most common organism. After engraftment, viral infection was
predominant. The incidence of invasive fungal infection showed bimodal distribu-
tion with peak correlated with neutropenia and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
The overall mortality and infection-related mortality rates according to 3 periods were
as follows; during pre-engraftment, 3.16% (12/379) and 1.8% (7/379); during mid-
recovery period, 7.9% (29/367) and 4.1% (15/367); during late-recovery period,
26.9% (91/338), and 15.9% (54/338). Risk factors for infection-related mortality
were as follows; during pre-engraftment period, fungal infection and septic shock;
during the mid-recovery period, hemorrhagic cystitis and delayed engraftment; dur-
ing the late-recovery period, fungal infection, chronic GVHD, and relapse. In con-
clusion, infection was still one of the main complications after HSCT and highly
contributes to mortality. The early diagnosis and the effective vaccination strategy
are needed for control of infections.

Conditioning regimen and GVHD prophylaxis
Two hundred ninety seven patients (78.4%) received total
body irradiation (TBI) as a part of conditioning and additional
cytoreductive agents consisting of cytarabine, cyclophos-
phamide, or busulfan. The other patients received non-TBI
based conditioning regimen, consisting of fludarabine, me-
phalan, busulfan, cyclosphosphamide, procarbazine, or anti-
thymocyte globulin (ATG). Sixteen patients received a con-
ditioning regimen of reduced intensity. Prophylaxis of GVHD
was cyclosporin A with short course methotrexate with or
without IL-2, tacrolimus with cyclosporin A or short course
methotrexate (Table 1).
Supportive care and antimicrobial prophylaxis
All patients were nursed in laminar airflow and high-effi-
ciency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered rooms until engraft-
ment. Intravenous access was achieved with a double-lumen
tunneled central venous catheter. Transfused blood products
were irradiated and leukocyte-depleted. All patients received
oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily as antibacterial prophylaxis.
Antifungal prophylaxis included fluconazole 50 mg (for autol-
ogous transplant recipients) or itraconazole 200 mg per os
(p.o.) daily (for allogeneic transplant recipients). Trimetho-
prim/sulfamethoxazole (80/400 mg p.o. daily) for Pneumo-
cystis pneumonia prophylaxis was given from engraftment
until posttransplant 6 months or more if GVHD were pre-
sent. Acyclovir (800 mg p.o. daily) given from -7 to engraft-
ment was followed by long-term low-dose (200 mg p.o. daily)
administration until 6 months posttransplantation. For cyto-
megalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis, high dose acyclovir (10 mg/
kg i.v. thrice daily) or ganciclovir (5 mg/kg intravenous (i.v.)
twice daily) with or without CMV immunoglobulin was
administered to patients who received MUD HSCT or haplo-
identical HSCT respectively.
Definition of terms
Fever was defined as a single oral temperature of ≥38.3℃
or temperature of ≥38℃ for ≥1 hr. Neutropenia was de-
fined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 500/ L

or less than 1,000/ L with predicted decline to 500/ L with-
in the next 2 days. Infections in febrile neutropenia were clas-
sified in accordance with the recommendations of the Infec-
tious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) (5) as follows: micro-
biologically documented infection (MDI), when a clinically
significant pathogen was identified from normally sterile speci-
men or from an affected site by culture or biopsy; clinically
documented infection (CDI), when fever was accompanied
by appropriate clinical findings; unexplained fever (UF) when
there was no clinical, radiological, or microbiological evidence
of infection.
Invasive fungal infection (IFI) was defined as possible, prob-
able, or proven, according to the published consensus criteria
(6). CMV infection was defined as isolation of CMV or detec-
tion of viral proteins or nucleic acid in any body fluid or tissue
specimen. CMV end-organ diseases were defined according
to definitions presented in the previous literature (7).
Acute GVHD was defined and graded according to the
standard criteria (8). Chronic GVHD was assessed as being
absent, limited, and extensive, as previously described (9).
Engraftment was defined as an ANC ≥500/ L on 3 con-
secutive days or established by bone marrow biopsy.
Patients were classified into 2 groups according to the dis-
ease status at the time of transplantation. Standard-status
group included cases of acute leukemia in the first remission,
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in the first chronic
phase, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with refractory ane-
mia (RA) or RA with ringed sideroblasts and severe aplastic
anemia (SAA) with a history of less than 20 pints of transfu-
sions before transplantation. The advanced-status group in-
cluded acute leukemia in second remission or relapse, the
accelerated phase or blast crisis of CML or CML in the second
chronic phase, MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts
[RAEB] or RAEB in transformation), non-Hodgkin’s lym-
phoma (NHL), and SAA with over 20 pints of transfusions
before transplantation (10).
Antibiotic treatment
An empirical antibiotic regimen was given to febrile neu-
tropenic patients according to the strategies of Catholic HSCT
Center that was modified from the IDSA guideline (5). Febrile
neutropenic patients were initially treated with ceftazidime
(2 g i.v. twice daily) or cefepime (2 g i.v. twice daily) in com-
bination with amikacin (750 mg, single daily). Glycopeptide
and conventional or liposomal amphotericin B were sequen-
tially added as a part of multi-step strategies if patient re-
mained febrile for 3-5 days after the start of initial therapy.
If the clinical status of patients deteriorated, initial antibi-
otics regimen was replaced by carbapenem. Whenever the
clinical status was deteriorating, modification was done ear-
lier. In patients with MDI, therapy was modified, if neces-
sary, according to the results of susceptibility test.
CMV antigenemia assay for pp65 antigen in leukocytes
was performed after engraftment. If CMV antigenemia was
positive (≥5 positive cells/200,000 leukocytes for low risk
group, ≥1 positive cells/200,000 leukocytes for high risk
group), pre-emptive ganciclovir was administered (5 mg/kg
i.v. twice daily) until 2 consecutive negative assays or more
than 3 weeks (10).
Data collection and analysis
Baseline information included age, sex, underlying dis-
eases, disease status at the time of transplantation, the type
of donor, and the intensity of conditioning regimen.
We reviewed and analyzed the clinical and microbiologi-
cal features of recipients in the context of three risk phases
following HSCT, that is, pre-engraftment period (from the
day of the transplant to engraftment, approximately day 30),
mid-recovery period (from engraftmemt until day 100), and
late-recovery period (from day 100 until the patient regains
normal immunity).
We used 2
-test or the Fisher’s exact test for the analysis
of categorical variables and the Student t-test for continuous
variables. We evaluated risk factors affecting mortality by
univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. A p-
value <0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.
RESULTS
Clinical characteristics
The median age of 379 recipients was 33 yr (range:15-
61) with the ratio of male to female 203:176. Acute myelo-
geneous leukemia (AML) was the most common underly-
ing disease (n=151, 39.8%) followed by acute lymphocytic
leukemia (ALL), CML, SAA, and others including 11 cases
of severe autoimmune diseases.
A total of 287 patients received allogeneic HSCT from
MSD (n=211, 55.6%), MUD (n=66, 17.4%), and haplo-
type mismatched related donors (n=7, 1.8%). The others
received autologous HSCT (n=92, 24.3%).
The source of stem cells was bone marrow (BM) in 232
cases (61.2%), peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) in 96 cases
(25.3%), BM plus PBSC in 49 cases (12.9%), and cord blood
in the remaining 2 cases (0.5%).
Median time to engraftment was 15 days (range, 6-126).
There were four cases of graft failures and one of them received
bone marrow reinfusion and engrafted. However, all patients
with graft failure died due to infectious and/or other com-
plications. The more detailed patient characteristics are sum-
marized in Table 1.
Infections during the preengraftment period
Two hundred and thirty two patients (61.2%) developed
202 S.H. Park, S.-M. Choi, D.-G. Lee, et al.
288 febrile episodes during hospitalization. Among 288
episodes, 70 (24.3%) were MDI, 160 (55.5%) were CDI,
and 58 (20.1%) were UF. The median time to development
of fever was 6 days after HSCT (range: -4~9 days) and the
mean duration of therapeutic antibiotics was 15.8±9.8 days.
The oropharynx was the most common site of infection and
the second most common site was the gastrointestinal tract,
followed by the lower respiratory tract, the skin and soft tis-
sue, and primary bacteremia successively (Table 2). A total
of 92 organisms were identified during the pre-engraftment
period. Bacterial pathogens accounted for 78.3% (72/92) of
the MDI. Overall, the proportion of Gram-negative bacteria
was much higher than that of Gram-positive bacteria (51.1%
vs. 27.2%, respectively) Escherichia coli was the predominant
pathogen followed by Staphylococcus spp. (9 coagulase-nega-
tive staphylococci, 2 S. aureus), Streptococcus spp. (5 alpha-he-
molytic streptococci, 3 S. mitis, 1 beta-hemolytic Streptococ-
cus), and Enterococcus spp. (4 E. faecium, 2 E. faecalis) (Table 3).
There were 32 cases of invasive fungal infection (IFI), in
which only one case was proven to be Aspergillus spp. infec-
tion, and the others were possible IFI. Candida infection did
not occur in any cases. Twelve patients died during pre-eng-
raftment period, and seven of them died of infection (7/12,
58.3%). There were 3 cases of graft failure among the dead
(3/12, 25%).

Infections during the mid-recovery period (from engraft-
ment until day 100)
Because 12 out of 379 patients died before engraftment,
367 patients in the mid recovery period were analyzed. Over-
all, 70 patients had infectious complications requiring hos-
pitalization, and a total of 76 infection episodes developed.
The skin and soft tissue and lower respiratory tract were the
most common sites of infection (Table 2). Viral infections
were predominant and accounted for 77.8% of pathogens
isolated (Table 3). Herpes viruses (25 varicella-zoster viruses
[VZV], 4 Cytomegalovirus [CMV], 2 Epstein-Barr virus
[EBV], 1 Human herpes virus-6 [HHV-6]) were the most
common pathogens. There was a case of meningoencephali-
tis caused by HHV-6 and 2 cases of EBV-associated post-
transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD). In this
period, IFI developed in 9 patients (9/367, 2.5%), which
were one case of paranasal aspergillosis confirmed by histo-
pathology and 8 cases of possible IFI. Among 76 episodes,
the skin and soft tissue infections (n=26, 34.2%), which
included chicken pox and herpes zoster, was most predomi-
nant followed by the lower respiratory tract infection.
During the early post-transplant period (pre-engraftment
and mid-recovery periods), there were a total of 17 cases of
virus-associated hemorrhagic cystitis including BK virus in
11 cases, adenovirus in 2, JC virus in 1, adenovirus plus BK
virus in 1, and BK virus plus JC virus in 2 cases.
Twenty eight patients died during the mid-recovery peri-
od, and 15 of them died of infection (15/28, 53.6%). There
was one case of follow-up loss. The underlying hematologi-
cal malignancies were relapsed in 3 cases among the dead
(3/28, 10.7%).
Infections in the late-recovery period (from day 100)
Out of 367 patients, 28 patients died during the mid-
recovery period and one patient was lost during the follow-
up. Three hundred thirty three patients were analyzed. A
total of 154 patients had infectious complications, and 228
episodes of infection developed. The most common site of
infection was the lower respiratory tract (42.1%, 96/228),
followed by the skin and soft tissue, which included chicken
pox and herpes zoster (Table 2). About 26.2% (96/367) of
recipients experienced VZV infection after transplantation
(25 in mid and 74 in late recovery period), which consisted
of 11 chicken pox, and 88 herpes zoster. Among the 88 pati-
ents of herpes zoster, 3 patients had relapsed herpes zoster
and 7 patients had disseminated herpes zoster. The seroposi-
tivity for CMV was very high before allogeneic HSCT in
both recipients (n= 275, 96.8%) and donors (n=276, 97.5%).
Overall, CMV antigenemia occurred in 161 recipients who
underwent allogeneic HSCT (161/287, 56%), and 11 patients
developed CMV diseases (pneumonia 8; colitis, 1; retinitis
2). Median time to CMV diseases was 162 days after trans-
plantation (range, 39-724 days). There were 27 cases of IFI
(27/338, 7.98%) which included 2 proven, 3 probable, and
22 possible cases and fungi were the second most common
pathogens during this period. Pneumocystis pneumonia occurred
in 3 patients (0.8%, 3/367). During the mid and late recov-

Clinical outcome and risk factor
Fourteen cases were lost during the follow-up period (1 in
mid-recovery period, 13 in late-recovery period) and all of
them had underlying diseases relapsed. They were presumed
to be dead and counted as deaths. The mortality rate during
pre-engraftment period was 3.2% (12/379) and among the
12 deaths, 7 deaths (58.3%) were attributable to infection;
four patients had pneumonia and three had septic shock.
The mortality during mid-recovery period was 7.9% (29/
367) and 15 deaths (51.7%, 15/29) were attributed to infec-
tion; 12 patients had pneumonia, 2 had hemorrhagic cystitis
and 1 had fulminant hepatitis B. In the late-recovery period,
the mortality rate was 26.9% (91/338), and 59.3% (54/91)
of these deaths were related to infection; 42 patients with
pneumonia, 7 with septic shock, 1 with necrotizing fasci-
itis, 1 with cerebral aspergillosis, and 3 with fulminant hep-
atitis B. Among the deaths after engraftment, 72 cases had
underlying diseases relapsed (3 in mid-recovery period, 68
in late-recovery period). (Table 4, Fig. 1).
By univatiate analysis, risk factors for infection-related
mortality in accordance with the periods and types of HSCT,
are summarized in Table 5. Multivariate analysis showed
that risk factors for infection-related mortality were as fol-
lows; during pre-engraftment period, fungal infection and
septic shock; during the mid-recovery period, presence of
hemorrhagic cystitis and delayed engraftment were signifi-
cantly important, and transplantation from alternative donors
(unrelated or haplotype mismatched related donors), although
statistically not significant, had a trend to infection-related
death (p=0.06) ; during the late-recovery period, fungal infec-
tion, presence of chronic GVHD, and relapse were signifi-
cantly important risk factors in allogeneic HSCT. Relapse of
underlying disease and fungal infections were the significant
risk factors following autologus HSCT.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we focused on the recent trends and clinical
outcomes of infectious complications in accordance with the
changes in HSCT from January 2001 to December 2002.
When compared with the previous reports at the same cen-
ter (11-13), there were several changes in HSCT. First, the
proportion of HSCT from unrelated matched donors had
increased. Second, the spectrum of patients was more widened
because NST for elderly or high risk patients who were vul-
nerable to treatment related mortality, and transplantations
from haplotype mismatched related donors were introduced

and performed increasingly. And also, refractory autoimmune
disorders were tried to treat by use of autologous HSCT (4).
All of the above changes put the recipients under more pro-
found, prolonged immunosuppression for prevention and
treatment of GVHD, and for controlling underlying disor-
ders in case of autoimmune disorders.
During the pre-engraftment period, the proportion of MDI
and CDI had become larger than that of the past (43% in
between 1993 and 1999 vs. 79.8% between 2001 and 2002)
(4, 11-13). Among MDI, bacterial pathogens accounted for
85.6%. In contrast to the previous studies from other coun-
tries, which identified that Gram positive cocci (GPC) were
the predominant pathogens (3, 4, 14), the most common
cause of bacteremia had been Gram negative bacilli (GNB)
rather than Gram positive cocci (GPC) at the Catholic HSCT
center and E. coli had been the most frequently isolated dur-
ing the last decade (4, 11, 12). In the present study, E. coli
was still the most common cause of MDI. We conducted
antimicrobial prophylaxis using ciprofloxacin since 1995.
However, quinolone prophylaxis did not decrease the inci-
dence of GNB infection but increased that of quilonolone-
resistant E. coli (76.6%, 26/32) (data not shown here), which
had become a major concern at the Catholic HSCT center
(15, 16). Although the efficacy of ciprofloxacin prophylaxis
was still controversial (16-18), we continued to use ciproflo-
xacin prophylaxis on the basis of two reasons. First, despite
the emergence of quinolone resistance in E. coli, cross-resis-
tance to -lactam, especially 3rd generation cephalosporin
and aminoglycoside, was rare and mortality rate due to qui-
nolone resistant E. coli was low (13, 19). Second, the incidence
of the most stains of GNB other than E. coli, such as P. aerugi-
nosa, decreased and they remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin
(15, 16). Despite the predominance of GNB infections, the
incidence of GPC infections among bacterial pathogens were
continuously increasing during the past decade from 25.0%
(8/32) during the early 1990s to 34.7% (25/72) in the pre-
sent study (11-13). Among Gram positive organisms, a trend
in dominant pathogens had been changing from Staphylococ-
cus spp. to Streptococcus spp. and the ratio of streptococci to
staphylococci was increased from 5:13 in the late 1990s to
9:9 in the present study. Severe mucositis due to intensive
conditioning regimen using TBI, and use of ciprofloxacin as
antimicrobial prophylaxis could be possible explanations for
this change (20). Fludarabine, as well as cytarabine, was report-
ed to be associated with streptococcal bacteremia (20). There-
fore, increasing use of fludarabine-based conditioning regi-
mens could lead to the shift to streptococcal infection in the
future. Considering all of the changes described above, a
question whether we should continue ciprofloxacin or not,
is raised and further assessment of the effectiveness of quinolone
prophylaxis is warranted.
As patients remain functionally and quantitatively defi-
cient in T and B lymphocytes even after full hematopoietic
reconstitution during the post-engraftment period (2, 3), the
patterns of infection are quite different from those of the pre-
engraftment period. In this study, viral infections, especially
VZV and CMV, were the main problem during mid and late
recovery period and this pattern of infectious complications
was not changed from the past (4, 12, 13). However, com-
pared to the previous report in the late 1990s, the overall
incidence CMV infections in recipients of allogeneic HSCT
was increased from 35% to 56%, but in contrast, the inci-
dence of CMV disease decreased from 6.5% to 3.8% (11/
287) (4, 12, 13). CMV diseases tended to develop in late
recovery period. The low incidence but late occurrence could
be partly due to the effect of risk-adaptive preemptive gan-
ciclovir therapy guided by CMV antigenemia (10, 21). How-
ever, it should be taken into consideration that there was no
difference in the incidence of CMV disease with or without
preemptive therapy (10), and CMV antigenemia did not always
precede CMV disease. Therefore, we needed the more sensi-
tive method to detect CMV reactivation, and recently, we
adopted real-time polymerase chain reaction for detection
and quantification of CMV infection. And, further study to
compare the efficacy of diagnostic methods to prevent CMV
disease will be warranted.
There were only 3 cases of microbiologically proven Pneu-
mocystis pneumonia (0.79%, 3/367). Its incidence was remark-
ably decreased compared to the previous report in the late
1990s at this center (6.5%, 15/230) (13, 22). The more strict
application of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim prophylaxis in
allogeneic HSCT recipients seemed to be effective for pre-
vention of Pneumocystis pneumonia. Pneumocystis pneumonia
developed in late recovery period and two of them occurred
at more than 6 months after transplantation. Although its
incidence was low, there were 9 cases of radiologically sus-
pected Pneumocystis pneumonia who were treated with sul-
famethoxazole/trimethoprim. Three patients who received
autologous PBSCT developed Pneumocystis pneumonia (2
suspicious cases and 1 confirmed case) in this study. There-
fore, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim prophylaxsis should be
considered not only for the patients who received allogeneic
HSCT but also those who received autologus HSCT with risk
factors, and duration of this prophylaxis should be extended
as long as chronic GVHD is resolved or immunosuppres-
sants are discontinued (23, 24).
The mortality rate during the pre-engraftment period
tended to decline during the past decade thanks to the im-
provement of peri-transplantation procedures and supportive
care (7.6% in the early 1990s, 4% in the late 1990s and 3.2%
in the early 2000s) (4, 11-13). As more patients survived
after engraftment, the infectious complications after engraft-
ment became more important. Infectious complications were
most common during the pre-engraftment period followed
by the late-recovery, and mid-recovery period successively.
However, mortality rate was highest during the late-recovery
period and the proportion of infection-related death was simi-
lar in all three periods, which indicated that the more patients
Infectious Complications Following HSCT 205
died directly due to infectious complications during the late
recovery period and infection was a still important matter
in managing transplant recipients after recovery of neutrope-
nia. This trend had started to become apparent since the late
1990s because transplants from alternative donors such as
unrelated donors or family mismatched donors had started
to be performed at that time and used increasingly. Among
the risk factors attributable to infection-related mortality,
IFI was the statistically significant, independent factor in
both pre-engraftment and late recovery periods and during
the early and late recovery periods, was the presence of GVHD
after allogeneic HSCT. The timing of IFI was bimodal dis-
tribution in this study, with peak that was correlated with
neutropenia (pre-engraftment) and GVHD (late recovery
period). Prolonged neutropenia before engraftment is well
known as an absolute risk factor for IFI. The presence of
GVHD and subsequent immunosuppression after engraft-
ment are also established risk factors (25-27). The shift from
early to late post-engraftment IFI may be affected by neu-
trophil dysfunction in the setting of GVHD and corticos-
teroid administration, an increase in the proportion of patients
who are alive late after engraftment thanks to the advance of
supportive measure, and increase in the proportion of trans-
plantations from unrelated donors or mismatched siblings,
which require more immunosuppression to prevent rejection
and GVHD. And also CMV infection could affect this shift
although mechanism to explain the association between CMV
infection and fungal infections are unknown (25-27).
Now, we could say that it is important how to manage not
only the patients with neutropenia but also the patients with
GVHD. Recently, the potent immunosuppressive agents
were used for the management of refractory severe GVHD
and could become a major contributor to risk for Aspergillus
infections (26). Alemtuzumab, anti-CD52 monoclonal anti-
body, that depletes peripheral blood T and B cells without
affecting the stem cells, has increasingly come to be used in
HSCT recipients for the management of GVHD as well as a
part of the conditioning regimen, and conferred a significantly
greater risk for fungal and CMV infections (26, 27). And its
usage is expected to be increased. In accordance with the
changing management of HSCT recipients after engraftment,
a new strategy of risk adapted antifungal and antiviral pro-
phylaxis should be made. Wingard suggested that continu-
ation of antifungal prophylaxis was reasonable until the com-
pletion of the immunosuppressive treatment course or until
immunosuppression is substantially reduced (28). However,
duration of antifungal therapy and what kind of antifungals
to be used as prophylaxis need to be evaluated and cautiously
defined. We should develop and adopt the new methods for
early detection of fungus, such as galactomannan enzyme
immunosorbent assay (29) and nucleic acid sequence based
amplification for invasive aspergillosis (30). And preemptive
or prompt antifungal treatment guided by early diagnosis,
should be done in high risk patients. For prevention of bac-
terial and viral infection, the more effective vaccination strat-
egy which is the economic and easy way to prevent infections,
should be established and strictly controlled.
