Iron chelation therapy (ICT) has been applied for the patients with iron overload-associated liver dysfunction since it is one of
the causes of death in patients with intractable hematological diseases requiring multiple red blood cell transfusions. Recently,
deferasirox (DSX), a novel, once-daily oral iron chelator, was demonstrated to have similar eﬃcacy to the conventional continuous
infusion of deferoxamine on a decrease in serum ferritin (SF) level in heavily transfused patients. We show three cases of
transfusion-mediated iron-overloaded patients with an elevated serum alanine aminotransaminase (ALT). All three patients who
received the ICT with DSX showed a decrease in ALT level in association with a decrease in SF level. It is suggested that DSX
therapy could be considered to expect the improvement of liver damage for iron-overloaded patients with an abnormal ALT
level.
1. Introduction
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion therapy is used in the
clinical setting for a variety of indications. In the hema-
tological disorders such as myelodysplastic anemia (MDS)
or aplastic anemia (AA), RBC transfusions are a life-saving
treatment for patients with chronic anemia. As the number
of RBC transfusion increases, patients develop iron overload-
associated dysfunction in various organs since the human
body has no mechanisms to actively excrete excessive iron.
Liver is one of the most aﬀected organs since it is the
primary site of iron storage in the body, and multiple RBC
transfusions result in hepatocellular injury and progression
to liver failure. Recent study demonstrated that 6.7% cases
of death among patients with the transfusion-dependent
anemia were caused by liver failure due to the signiﬁcantly
heavy RBC transfusions [1]. It was reported that the
overall survival in transfusion-dependent MDS patients was
signiﬁcantly shorter than that in those who did not require
transfusions [2]. Although the direct association between
iron overload and short survival, especially in adults with
AA or MDS has not been clearly shown, and the association
between iron chelation therapy (ICT) and prolonged survival
is still questionable, ICT has been applied for the transfusion-
dependent patients to expect prevention of iron overload-
associated liver dysfunction.
Recently, deferasirox (DSX), a novel, once-daily oral iron
chelator, was demonstrated to have similar eﬃcacy to the
conventional continuous infusion of deferoxamine (DFO)
on a decrease in serum ferritin (SF) level in heavily transfused
patients with sickle cell disease [3]. In addition, it was shown
in a large EPIC study that there was a trend of decrease in
an average serum alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) level
among transfusion-dependent MDS patients receiving ICT
with DSX [4]. However, it remains fully elucidated whether
iron-overloaded individuals with an elevated ALT achieve a
decrease in ALT level by the ICT with DSX. In this paper, we
show three cases of transfusion-mediated iron-overloaded
patients with hematological diseases showing an elevated
ALT. The ALT was decreased and subsequently normalized
by the treatment with DSX in association with a decrease in
SF level in all the three patients.

2. Case Presentation
From October 2008 to December 2009, ICT with DSX was
initiated in our institute for 19 patients with hematological
diseases including MDS (n = 9), aplastic anemia (AA,
n = 7), myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN, n = 2), and
congenital hemolytic anemia (n = 1). Of these, 3 patients
including AA (n = 1, UPN #4) and MDS (n = 2, UPN
#2, #8) were diagnosed as iron overload-associated liver
dysfunction. Clinical diagnosis of iron overload-associated
liver dysfunction was made as follows: either SF level of above
1000 ng/mL or that of below 1000 ng/mL with a history
of multiple RBC transfusions of more than 20 transfusion
episodes and an elevated ALT level above 44 IU/L. All patients
received serological tests for antihepatitis C virus (HCV)
antibody and antihepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and
abdominal ultrasound to show no other apparent causes for
an elevated ALT level including infection of HBV and HCV,
liver mass. In addition, drug- or alcohol-induced liver injury
was excluded based on the present illness. Normalization
of liver enzyme level was deﬁned as ALT below 44 IU/L on
consecutive two laboratory assessments. All the patients had
no other apparent factors inﬂuencing the SF levels.
A 33-year-old female with AA (UPN #4) received trans-
fusion of more than 222 packed RBC units (1 packed RBC
unit derived from 200 mL whole blood) for 10 years in
combination with intermittent administration of DFO (21 g
per year). Her SF value was kept high around 10000 ng/mL.
Eight years after the onset of AA, she developed diabetes
mellitus requiring insulin therapy. Laboratory examinations
at baseline showed that ALT and SF were elevated to
42 IU/L and 9291 ng/mL, respectively. She received DSX
therapy at a dose of 1000 mg/day (16.1 mg/kg/day). The
ALT was gradually decreased accompanied with a decrease
in SF level. At seven months post DSX therapy, the ALT
was normalized to 42 IU/L when the SF was decreased to
5147 ng/mL. Both aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) and
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were also elevated to 85 IU/L
(upper normal limit: 38 IU/L) and 818 IU/L (upper normal
limit: 338 IU/L), respectively before ICT. At seven months
post DSX therapy, AST was normalized to 35 IU/L and ALP
decreased to 519 IU/L. Total bilirubin (T-Bil) was within
normal limit before and after ICT and showed almost no
change.
A 74-year-old male with MDS (UPN #8) received
transfusions of 42 packed RBC units prior to DSX therapy
and required chronic transfusions of 8 packed RBC units
per month. Laboratory examinations showed that ALT
and SF were elevated to 72 IU/L and 886.8 ng/mL, respec-
tively. DSX treatment with an initial dose of 1000 mg/day
(16.7 mg/kg/day) was applied, which was followed by a
reduction of DSX dose to 500 mg/day (8.4 mg/kg/day) due to
an elevated serum creatinine from 1.00 mg/dL to 1.49 mg/dL.
The ALT reached normal level (44 IU/L) at 5 weeks post DSX
therapy. At the same point, SF was decreased to 485.9 ng/mL.
The average dose of DSX was 14.9 mg/kg/day. The AST
was high at 90 IU/L at the baseline, and it was decreased
to 55 IU/L at 5 weeks post DSX therapy. The γ-glutamyl
transpeptidase (γ-GTP) and T-Bil were high at 99 IU/L and
1.9 mg/dL, respectively, before ICT, and these parameters
showed almost no change post DSX therapy.
A 56-year-old female with MDS complicated with
nephrotic syndrome (UPN #2) received transfusions of
82 packed RBC units before she received DSX therapy.
The transfusion requirement was 2.7 packed RBC units
in a month during DSX therapy. Laboratory examina-
tions showed that ALT and SF were elevated to 84 IU/L
and 1436 ng/mL, respectively. She received 500 mg/day
(10.6 mg/kg/day) of DSX for the ﬁrst 3 weeks and received
1000 mg/day (21.3 mg/kg/day) of DSX thereafter. At 15 weeks
post DSX therapy, it was conﬁrmed that the ALT value
reached normal level at 31 IU/L when the SF was decreased to
994.8 ng/mL. Immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine
had been applied to this patient for the treatment of MDS.
After the administration of DSX, serum creatinine was
elevated to the maximal of 1.64 mg/dL from the baseline
level of 0.95 mg/dL. Reduction in cyclosporine dosage by
33% brought about improvement of creatinine level to
1.18 mg/dL in the absence of the adjustment of DSX dosage.
The average dose of DSX was 19.1 mg/kg/day. The AST was
high at 64 IU/L before ICT, and it was normalized to 36 IU/L
at 15 weeks post DSX therapy. The ALP, albumin (Alb), and
T-Bil were normal before ICT, and these parameters showed
almost no change post DSX therapy.
3. Discussion
In this paper, we show three cases of transfusion-mediated
iron-overloaded patients with an elevated ALT, whose level
was decreased by the ICT with DSX. This favorable eﬀect of
DSX on abnormal ALT level was observed in all patients who
received the ICT during the observation periods (three out of
three patients). The abnormal AST level was also decreased
in all 3 patients receiving DSX therapy. The other parameters
regarding the liver function including ALP, γ-GTP, T-Bil,
and Alb seemed not to be apparently changed. Our cases
support the observation in a large EPIC study that the ICT
with DSX exhibited a trend of decrease in an average ALT
among the transfusion-dependent patients. In addition, our
observation provides additional information that not only
individual patients with normal ALT but also those with an
elevated abnormal ALT could get beneﬁt of improving the
liver dysfunction from the ICT with DSX.
We did not have possibility to perform a liver biopsy
to examine histology in our patients because all patients
were thrombocytopenic and had risk of bleeding compli-
cation caused by a liver biopsy. Therefore, the association
between liver damage and iron overload is circumstantial
and not directly proven, and it was unclear whether the
improvement of abnormal ALT accompanied with a decrease
in SF was associated with the improvement of histologi-
cal damage in liver. Regarding this issue, previous study
showed that hepatic ﬁbrosis occurs at around 400 uM/g of
liver iron concentrations (LICs) in patients with hereditary
hemochromatosis [5]. It was also demonstrated in patients
with transfusional iron overload that elevation of ALT was
observed only when LIC exceeded 300 to 400 uM/g and that
abnormal ALT level became normal when LIC fell below
Case Reports in Medicine 3
350 uM/g with iron chelation therapy with DFO [6]. These
observations imply the existence of critical LIC of 300 to
400 uM/g above which histological hepatocellular injury is
developed and is indicated by an elevated ALT. Therefore, we
would suggest that a decrease in ALT by the ICT with DSX
might be one of the parameters reﬂecting the improving liver
damage in iron-overloaded patients.
In summary, three cases of transfusion-mediated iron-
overloaded patients with hematological diseases exhibiting
improvement of abnormal ALT by the ICT with DSX were
presented. It was suggested that DSX therapy could be
considered for such patients to expect the improvement of
liver damage.
