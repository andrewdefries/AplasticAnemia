Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease in which chronic
inflammation leads to joint destruction and extra-articular complications. Early and effective
inhibition of inflammation is critical in order to prevent the progressive joint damage that
occurs rapidly after onset of the disease. In the past, treatment for this purpose was limited
to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which were often
suboptimal. Within the last decade however, the development of biologic therapies, targeted
against cytokines and cells involved in the inflammatory process, has revolutionized the
management of RA. Disease remission is now an achievable goal in newly diagnosed patients.
Since the advent of the first tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor in 1999, other biologics have
proved necessary as individuals respond to varying degrees with different therapies. Several
are now available for the treatment of patients with RA that remains active despite DMARD
treatment. This article reviews the evidence, over the last decade, of the efficacy and safety
of biologic therapies used in this context, and the recent clinical data supporting the use of
biologic therapy earlier in the disease process as first-line therapy.

Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting 1% of adult
­Western populations, and is the largest cause of treatable disability in the Western
World.1
It is associated with considerable pain, stiffness, and swelling of joints. If
not adequately controlled, it results in joint destruction, deformity, and disability.
In addition, it is a systemic disorder; persistent systemic inflammation may lead to
extra-articular manifestations, and also to increased cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality.2
The socio-economic impact is also significant. A study in 1989 demonstrated that,
10 years after diagnosis of RA, only half of patients were employed and 42% of patients
considered themselves disabled.3
Since then, improved understanding of the disease has
shaped clinical practice, with the current approach to treatment being based principally
upon the paradigm that the level of inflammation over time determines damage. Studies
have demonstrated that damage occurs early in the disease process, and that subclinical
inflammation and associated joint damage can continue despite improvement in patients’
symptomswithtreatment.4
Hence,theaimoftreatmentofRAhasadvancedfromsymptom
control to early and optimal control of inflammation, with use of immunosuppressive
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate (MTX).

­Comparison of treatment strategies in early RA has confirmed
that tight control of inflammatory disease activity offers
improvedoutcomesforpatients.TheTICORAstudycompared
routine treatment (DMARD treatment and three-monthly
assessment) to intensive management involving monthly
assessment and escalation of DMARD treatment in the pres-
enceofevenlow-leveldiseaseactivity,accordingtoaprotocol.5
A similar comparison of three-monthly versus monthly assess-
ment was employed in the CAMERA study, in which treatment
with MTX was increased, or another DMARD was added as
necessary to meet targets of disease control.6
For a number of patients however, MTX and other
conventional DMARDs are ineffective at achieving sup-
pression of disease activity and preventing permanent joint
damage.This need for alternative, superior treatment options
has led to the development of biologic therapies, ­targeted
against cells and cytokines known to play a role in the
pathogenesis of RA (Figure 1).7
In clinical practice, ­biologic
therapies are licensed for use in patients with moderate to
severely active RA who have not responded to DMARDs.
This article reviews the evidence supporting their use in these
circumstances and the emerging evidence for use outside this
remit in patients with early RA who may not have previously
received DMARD treatment.
Assessing efficacy of biologics
International standards for assessment of disease activity
in RA allow comparison of response to treatment across
studies (Table 1). When a number of outcome measures
of disease activity were assessed using expert opinion and
analysis of placebo-controlled trial data, 20% improvement
in the American College of Rheumatology response criteria
(ACR20) proved reliable at discriminating active treatments
from placebo effects.8
This is commonly used as the primary
outcome measure in randomized controlled trials of RA treat-
ment, including many of the trials discussed in this review.
However, it is of no use for measuring the status of disease
activity in the individual patient in clinic, unlike the Disease
Activity Score (DAS), a continuous variable that relates to
disease state and is useful in clinical practice.
TNF inhibition
The first inhibitor of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α), infliximab, was launched over 10 years ago, ini-
tially for use in Crohn’s disease. Since then, infliximab and
others have been approved for use in rheumatoid disease.
­Infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept are blockers ofTNF
that have been used in clinical practice for several years, while
certolizumab and golimumab have recently been developed
and approved (Table 2). Clinical trials demonstrating their
efficacy are discussed below.

Biologic therapy in rheumatoid disease
MTX in 1999. The ATTRACT study went on to assess
the efficacy of infliximab with MTX in patients who had
active RA despite at least three months of treatment with
MTX.11
Patients were randomized to placebo or one of
four treatment regimens: infliximab 3 mg/kg every 4 or
8 weeks and 10 mg/kg every 4 or 8 weeks. Disease dura-
tion ranged between 0.5 and 49.9 years, but was matched
across treatment groups, with the median duration being
7.2–9.0 years across the groups. At 30 weeks, superior
clinical response, assessed by the proportion of patients
achieving ACR20 and ACR50, was seen in all groups
receiving infliximab compared to placebo (Table 3). The
study was continued to 54 weeks. Response with infliximab
plus MTX was sustained, and superiority to placebo plus
MTX remained significant.12
As efficacy was comparable
between infliximab groups but side-effects were more
frequent with higher doses, 3 mg/kg was chosen as the
licensed dose. After this year, treatment was unblinded
and patients could continue their allocated treatment over
a further one year.31
Lower numbers of patients in the
­placebo group (28 compared to 55–64 in the infliximab plus
MTX groups) may be accounted for by their high rate of
withdrawal due to lack of efficacy in the first year (36%).
Again, clinical response was maintained, as illustrated by
similar ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 responses.
Progression in joint damage at one year was compared
between groups using the mean change in the total ­modified
Sharp score from baseline. The mean change in total score
in the MTX controls was 7.0, compared to a mean change
ranging from -0.7 to 1.6 in infliximab-treated groups
(P , 0.001), with the mean improvement of 0.7 seen in
patients receiving the highest dose of infliximab.12
Even in
patients who did not clinically respond to treatment (ie, did
not meet ACR20 criteria), infliximab had a beneficial effect
on radiographic progression; mean change in total score in the
MTX nonresponders was 7.2 compared to a mean of 0.2–2.6
in infliximab nonresponders (P # 0.002). In a ­sub-analysis
of patients with early disease (less than three years disease
duration), even greater differences were seen with the addi-
tion of infliximab.32
Mean changes in total score were 9.1
in MTX controls compared to -1.1 to 0.6 with infliximab
and MTX.
Table 1 Outcome measures used in intervention studies in RA
Outcome measure Method of assessment
Composite measures of disease activity:
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response
criteria:
A 20%, 50% or 70% improvement in the following measures
of disease:
  • ACR20   • number of tender joints
  • ACR50   • number of swollen joints
  • ACR70   • at least three out five further criteria: patient’s assessment of pain, global health, or
physical function; physician assessment of global health or a laboratory marker of
inflammation (CRP or ESR).8
Disease activity score (DAS) Calculated using a mathematical formula comprising:
  • number of swollen joints (out of 28 specified joints in the case of DAS28)
  • number of tender joints (out of 28)
  • patient self-assessment of global health (on a visual analog scale)
  • laboratory markers (CRP or ESR)
A DAS28 score of 5.1 or more is classed as high disease activity; low disease activity is
3.2 or less, and clinical remission is less than 2.6.
Patient outcomes:
Health-related quality of life,
Short form-36 (SF-36)
A self-assessment questionnaire measuring eight aspects of mental and physical well-being,
summarized in the mental component summary (MCS) and physical component summary
(PCS), judged on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 is the worst and 100 is the best outcome.
The minimal improvement which is accepted as meaningful is a decrease of at least
3 units.9
Health assessment questionnaire disability index
(HAQ-DI)
A self-assessment questionnaire of 8 aspects of physical disability, giving a score of 0 to 3,
where 0 is no disability and 3 is completely disabled.
The minimal improvement which is accepted as meaningful is a decrease of 0.22 or more.9

The ASPIRE study similarly compared MTX alone to
combination with infliximab, but included only patients
with RA of less than three years duration who were MTX-
naÏve.13
The majority of patients had not had prior exposure
to any DMARDs. As expected, compared to the ATTRACT
study of MTX-resistant patients, higherACR response rates
were seen across all treatment groups (Table 3). Despite
the higher response rates in this study with MTX alone,
significantly higher proportions of patients on infliximab
in combination with MTX achieved the superior response
levels (ACR50 andACR70).The addition of infliximab also
significantly decreased the progression of joint damage,
assessed using the modified Sharp score; from the median
increase of 0.4 with MTX alone to a median change of 0.0
seen in infliximab treatment groups (P , 0.001).
The BeSt study compared four treatment strategies in early
RA: MTX alone, changing to alternative DMARDs if response
inadequate;MTXalone,addingotherDMARDsincombination
if response inadequate; combination DMARD therapy initially
with high-dose corticosteroids; and MTX with the biologic
agent infliximab initially.14
More rapid clinical improvement
was achieved when a combination of DMARDs or MTX
with infliximab was used as a first line, with less progression
of joint damage seen on radiographs. In cases where disease
remained effectively suppressed, drug therapies (preferentially
corticosteroids or infliximab in the first instance) were tapered
and withdrawn.This was most successful in the group initially
treated with infliximab combination therapy; 53% of patients
were on just one drug for disease control at the end of the two-
year study (compared to 31%–36% in other groups).14

Biologic therapy in rheumatoid disease
Quinn et al attempted to induce clinical remission in
very early RA (DMARD-naïve patients with less than one
year of symptoms) in a small number of patients with poor
­prognostic features of disease such as positive rheumatoid
factor.33
Twenty patients were treated with MTX and ran-
domly assigned to receive either placebo or infliximab for
one year. The primary outcome of the study was achieved
(a difference between the groups in reduction of synovitis
on magnetic resonance imaging at 14 weeks). Improvement
in disease control, assessed by DAS28, was more rapid
in the infliximab group; at 14 weeks, median DAS28 was
­significantly lower compared with the placebo group. But
at 2 years (one year after stopping infliximab), although
median DAS28 was lower in infliximab-treated patients and
within the remission range, there was no significant differ-
ence compared to placebo.There was a significant ­difference
between the groups at 2 years however: in physical function,
assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)
score (P , 0.05). The authors postulate that this may be due
to the faster control of disease activity, that rapid ­disease
control may have socioeconomic benefits, and prevent
adverse illness behavior later in the disease. Follow-up data
suggests that early biologic treatment in patients with poor
prognostic features may have consequences for long-term
disease control; at 8 years, 40% of the patients initially
treated with infliximab were still in remission, compared to
0% of controls.34
Adalimumab
Results of the ARMADA trial were published in 2003,
­showing the efficacy of adalimumab in combination with
MTX.15
Similar to the ATTRACT study for infliximab,
patients had a range of disease duration (on average
approximately 12 years) and had active disease despite at
least 6 months of MTX treatment. At 24 weeks, at a dose
of 40 mg every two weeks (the dose used in current clinical
practice), patients had significantly greater clinical responses
at ACR20, ACR50, and ACR 70 levels (Table 4). Patients
reported greater improvement in physical ­function as
assessed by the 0–3 scale of the HAQ score; mean improve-
ment of 0.62 with adalimumab and MTX, compared to 0.27
with MTX alone (P , 0.001). Long-term efficacy data is
available after a 4-year open-label extension study in which
all patients received adalimumab in combination with MTX.35
The proportion of patients still receiving adalimumab at
4 years was 62%; adalimumab was stopped in 8% of patients
due to lack of efficacy. Comparison between data at 6 months
and 4 years, for patients in the original adalimumab treatment
groups who continued on treatment, showed that clinical
response with adalimumab treatment was maintained.
Keystone et  al assessed the effect of adalimumab
plus MTX on radiographic progression over one year in
a ­randomized controlled trial of MTX nonresponders.36
Patients treated with adalimumab and MTX had a smaller
mean change in modified total Sharp score compared to
patients on MTX and placebo (0.1 vs 2.7; P , 0.001).
Unlike infliximab, adalimumab has been shown to be safe
and effective when used as monotherapy.This was confirmed
by van der Putte et al in patients who had, on average, a dis-
ease duration of 11 years, and had failed previous DMARD
treatment (the majority of patients had failed at least three
different DMARDs).16
The proportion of patients achieving
an ACR20 response was significantly higher in the adali-
mumab group compared to the placebo group (46% vs 19%;

Horton et al
P , 0.001).This has importance for patients who are unable
to take MTX, either because of intolerance to its side-effects
or due to a contraindication. However, as superior efficacy is
achieved with combination treatment, MTX should be used
when possible.
The PREMIER study investigated patients with early RA
(disease duration up to 3 years) and poor prognostic disease
(rheumatoidfactorpositiveoratleast1jointerosion).17
Patients
were excluded if they had received specified DMARDs includ-
ing MTX. Patients were randomized to receive adalimumab in
combination with MTX, adalimumab monotherapy, or MTX
monotherapy. Of patients in the combination therapy arm, 62%
achieved the primary endpoint of an ACR50 response, which
was significantly greater in comparison to adalimumab mono-
therapy (46%) and MTX monotherapy (41%) (P , 0.001 for
both comparisons). The rate of remission (DAS28 , 2.6) at 2
years was 49% in patients on combination therapy, twice that
seen in the other treatment arms. At 2 years, the mean change
in modified total Sharp score with the combination treatment
was 1.9 compared to 10.4 with MTX alone (P , 0.001); and
HAQ Disability Index (DI) improved by the minimal clinically
meaningful difference in 72% of patients on combination
therapy compared to 58% and 63% in adalimumab and MTX
monotherapy groups respectively (P , 0.05). Further analysis

andclinicalresponsedemonstratedthatsignificantlylessradio-
graphic progression was achieved in patients on combination
therapy compared to MTX monotherapy across all clinical out-
comes, including patients who showed poor clinical response
(patients not meeting the ACR20 response criteria).37
In a sub-analysis of patients in the PREMIER study,
effect on quality of life was assessed, using the SF-36 health
survey, and compared to a sample of the general United States
population (from a national survey in 1998).38
As expected,
baseline scores for the physical component summary (PCS)
and mental component summary (MCS) were higher in the
US population compared to the RA group. At 2 years, the
PCS for those receiving combination therapy increased to a
level similar to that of the general population (47.8 vs 49.4;
P = 0.08). For those receiving MTX monotherapy, the score
increased but remained significantly lower than the general
population (44.4 vs 49.4; P , 0.0001). This is impressive,
considering that these were patients selected on the basis of
indicators of poor prognosis.
In the PROWD study, MTX-naïve patients with early
RA (duration up to 2 years) who had self-reported work
­impairment were randomized to adalimumab and MTX, or
placebo and MTX.18
There was no difference in the primary
outcome (job loss from any cause and/or imminent job
loss after week 16): 16% of patients on adalimumab and
MTX compared to 27% of patients on MTX monotherapy
(P = 0.092). There was a statistical difference however, if
numbers over the full 56-week study period were taken:
19% compared to 40% respectively (P = 0.005).The authors
point out that this may be due to the fact that more patients
in the placebo group dropped out after week 16 (25 patients)
­compared to the adalimumab-treated group (15 patients).
Etanercept
Two randomized controlled trials published in 1999 showed
the efficacy of etanercept. One study demonstrated the
efficacy of etanercept in combination with MTX,19
and
the other etanercept monotherapy.20
ACR20 was achieved
in 71% of patients on etanercept and MTX combination
therapy compared to 27% of controls (P , 0.001), and in
59% on etanercept monotherapy compared to 11% of con-
trols (P , 0.001) (Table 5). Study subjects were similar:
mean disease durations were 13 years and 12 years respec-
tively, and both studies required nonresponse to previous
DMARDs (MTX in the study by Weinblatt et al and one out
of four specified DMARDs, including MTX, in the study by
­Moreland et al).19,20
The TEMPO trial went on to compare three treatment
groups in a double-blind controlled design: etanercept and
MTX in combination, etanercept monotherapy, and MTX
monotherapy.21
Patients also had established RA, but mean
disease duration was lower (6.8 years), and they were required
to have had lack of response to DMARD therapy but not

Biologic therapy in rheumatoid disease
MTX. This explains the higher response rates seen in the
MTX group. In this patient cohort, a significantly ­better
clinical response rate over MTX monotherapy was seen
with etanercept and MTX at ACR50 and ACR70 levels, but
no significant difference was seen with etanercept mono-
therapy (Table 5). However, radiographic progression was
significantly less; at 1 year the mean change in total Sharp
score for etanercept in combination with MTX, etanercept
monotherapy, and MTX monotherapy was -0.54, 0.52, and
2.80 respectively (P , 0.0001 for combination therapy vs
MTX, and P = 0.0469 for etanercept monotherapy vs MTX).
Improvement in patients’self-reported physical functioning,
HAQ DI, was significantly greater in the combination group,
but was not significantly different between etanercept mono-
therapy and MTX monotherapy (improvements of 1.0, 0.7,
and 0.65 respectively). Quality of life was assessed using the
European Quality of Life Health StatusVisualAnalog Scale,
and superior improvements in quality of life were reported
by patients on combination treatment.39
Etanercept treatment was also assessed in MTX-naïve
patients with early RA: the COMET study and a study by
Bathon et al.22,23
COMET assessed etanercept in combination
with MTX, and Bathon et al assessed etanercept monother-
apy. COMET was different to previous trials in early arthritis,
as remission was used for the first time as the study endpoint
(DAS28 , 2.6), as opposed to using ACR response criteria.
At one year, the proportion of patients who achieved DAS28
remission was greater with etanercept and MTX than with
MTX alone (50% compared to 28%; P , 0.0001).This bene-
fit was sustained at 2 years; 57% of patients who continued on
combination therapy achieved DAS28 remission, compared
to 35% of patients remaining on MTX (P = 0.002).40
This
remission rate is greater than that seen in studies of MTX-
naïve patients with longer disease duration, such as the
TEMPO trial, in which the DAS28 remission rate was 42%
at 2 years with combination treatment. Bathon et al showed
etanercept monotherapy was more effective than MTX in the
first 6 months, with greater percentages of patients achieving
ACR20,ACR50 andACR70 (P , 0.05).At 2 years, there was
a significant difference in the proportion of patients achieving
ACR20 (72% vs 59% of MTX controls; P = 0.005), but no
significant difference atACR50 andACR70 levels.41
Patients
completing the study by Bathon et al entered an open-label
extension study of etanercept monotherapy, extending treat-
ment to 5 years.42
Efficacy was maintained for patients who
remained on etanercept from the original treatment group,
with 68% fulfilling ACR20 criteria at 5 years.
Both studies also assessed radiographic progression. In
the COMET study, no progression (defined as a change in
modified total Sharp score of 0.5 or less) was seen in 80% of
patients on etanercept and MTX, compared to 59% on MTX
alone (P , 0.0001). Similarly, nonprogression at 2 years was
demonstrated more frequently with etanercept monotherapy
than with MTX by Bathon et al (63% compared to 51%;
P = 0.017). In terms of patient outcomes, COMET showed
a significant difference in improvement in HAQ DI score
over 1 year between patients receiving etanercept with MTX
and MTX alone (improvements of 1.0 and 0.7 respectively;
P , 0.001). Patients receiving etanercept and MTX also
experienced benefits in terms of work stability; of patients
in full or part-time work at baseline, 9% had stopped work
at least once during the study, compared to 24% on MTX

in HAQ DI after 2 years; 55% of etanercept patients had
improved by at least 0.5 units, compared to 37% of MTX
patients (P , 0.001).
Certolizumab pegol
Results showing efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis have been
reported in patients with RA resistant to 6 months of MTX
(RAPID 1 and 2),24,25
and patients with RA resistant to
6 months of MTX or other DMARDs (FAST4WARD).26
Approximately 80% of patients in the FAST4WARD study
had previously been treated with MTX and, on average, had
failed two DMARDs. RAPID 1 and 2 showed efficacy of
two different preparations of certolizumab (lyophized and
liquid) in combination with MTX, whereas FAST4WARD
used certolizumab as monotherapy. Success in achieving
clinical response compared to placebo is shown in Table 6.
RAPID 1 and RAPID 2 produced similar response rates
with the different preparations. Therefore, only data from
RAPID 1 is presented here, for simplicity. Clinical responses
were maintained to week 52 in RAPID 1 and 2.
Improvement in physical function was significantly
greater with certolizumab used in combination with MTX,
and as monotherapy, compared to control groups. Mean
improvement in HAQ DI was 0.6 at 52 weeks with com-
bination therapy in RAPID 1, and 0.36 at 24 weeks with
monotherapy in FAST4WARD (P , 0.001 against placebo
in both studies). With combination therapy in RAPID 1,
inhibition of radiographic progression was significantly
greater than MTX alone (P , 0.001), but was not assessed
in FAST4WARD.
Golimumab
Efficacy in combination with MTX and as monotherapy
has been assessed in patients who are MTX-naïve
­(GO-BEFORE),28
and patients with active RA despite MTX
­treatment (GO‑FORWARD).27
Results in terms of ACR
response are shown in Table 7.
Golimumab is unique amongst the anti-TNF therapies
in that there is randomized controlled trial evidence for its
efficacy in patients who have previously received anti-TNF
therapy. In the GO-AFTER study, 58% of patients had
received previous anti-TNF treatment that was stopped due
to lack of efficacy, and 34% of patients had received more
than one anti-TNF in the past.29
Golimumab was given with
or without at least one DMARD. Approximately two thirds
of patients were taking concomitant MTX. A statistically
significant difference was seen compared to placebo in the
percentage of patients achieving ACR20 (34% vs 17%) and
ACR50 responses (18% vs 5%) (P , 0.001 for both levels
of response). There was also a difference in improvement in
HAQ DI; mean improvement was 0.3 with golimumab, but
0.0 in controls (P , 0.001).
Inhibition of T cell activation: abatacept
For T cell activation, in addition to binding to antigen, a co-
stimulatory signal is also necessary. This is produced by the
binding of CD28 molecules on the T cell surface to CD80/
CD86 molecules on the surface of an ­antigen-presenting cell.
T cells are capable of expressing cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
antigen 4 (CTLA 4), which binds to CD80/CD86 more
readily than CD28, thereby preventing this second process
required for T cell activation. Abatacept is a recombinant
protein consisting of the extracellular domain of CTLA 4
and human immunoglobulin; therefore, it ­inhibits T cell
activation.43
It is given intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/kg
every 4 weeks.
Abatacept has been assessed in combination with
DMARD therapy (usually MTX) in randomized ­controlled
trials of patients with established RA which is active despite
MTX (AIM and Kremer et al),44,45
and despite ­previous
­anti-TNF treatment (ATTAIN)46

rates of clinical improvement and improvement in physical
function with abatacept plus DMARD in comparison to
DMARD alone (Table 8). In all three studies, significantly
more patients in abatacept groups achieved clinically
meaningful improvement in HAQ scores (P , 0.001).
Abatacept has also been shown to improve health-related
quality of life. For example, in theATTAIN study, improve-
ment in PCS and MCS scores of the SF-36 was greater than
improvement in the control group at levels of significance
of P , 0.001 and P , 0.01 respectively. The AIM study
also assessed radiographic change, showing approximately
50% reduction in the progression of radiographic dam-
age when abatacept was added to DMARD treatment;
median change in total Genenant-modified Sharp score
from baseline was 0.25 with abatacept plus DMARD
therapy, compared to 0.53 with DMARD therapy alone
(P = 0.012).44
Patients completing these trials were eligible to receive
10 mg/kg abatacept with DMARD in open-label extension
studies. In all three studies, the ACR response rates achieved
in the original abatacept groups were maintained at the end of
the study periods, in the patients who remained on ­abatacept.
The rate of discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was 2% over
the 1-year extension period of the AIM trial,47
11% over the
4-year extension by Kremer et al48
and 16% over 18 months
after the ATTAIN trial (patients who had ­previously received
anti-TNF).49
Radiographicprogressionintheoriginalabatacept
group of the AIM trial was significantly slower in the second
year of treatment compared to the first, suggesting an increas-
ing effect of abatacept on structural damage in year 2.43

in MTX-naïve patients with early RA (disease duration
up to 2 years) and poor prognostic factors (seropositve
for ­rheumatoid factor and/or anti-CCP), and presence of

radiographic erosions.50
Primary endpoints were remission
(DAS28 , 2.6) and Genant-modified total Sharp score at
1 year. DAS28 remission was achieved in 42% of patients in
the abatacept and MTX group, compared to 23% receiving
MTX alone (P , 0.001).There was also a significant ­slowing
of radiographic progression (mean change in total score 0.63
vs 1.06; P = 0.040). Results are comparable to anti-TNF in
early RA; for example, the COMET study of etanercept.This
is particularly impressive, considering that patients were
selected based on the basis of poor prognostic factors (90%
of patients were anti-CCP positive).
Unlike other biologic treatments, the efficacy of abatacept
in undifferentiated arthritis has been assessed.51
Patients
were anti-CCP positive with at least two swollen and ten-
der joints, and therefore highly likely to develop RA, but
did not yet fulfil the criteria for the 1987 definition of RA
by the ­American College of Rheumatology.52
They were
­randomized to abatacept or placebo treatment for 6 months.
At one year (6 months after treatment was discontinued), 46%
of abatacept-treated versus 67% of placebo-treated patients
developed RA (95% confidence interval for the difference
between the groups: -47% to 7%).Abatacept also prevented
radiographic progression; mean change in Genant-modified
Sharp score, from baseline to one year, was 0.01 in abatacept-
treated patients vs 1.11 in placebo controls (95% confidence
interval for difference between the groups: -2.05 to -0.15).
B cell inhibition: rituximab
Rituximab is a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal ­antibody
that selectively depletes CD20-expressing B cells. The
mechanism by which rituximab depletes B cells may be
by cell-mediated or complement-dependant toxicity, or by
promotion of apoptosis.53
It has been used to treat non-
Hodgkins lymphoma since 1997, but has since been licensed
for use in RA in combination with MTX.54
It is administered
in two intravenous infusions of 1g, two weeks apart, with
intravenous glucocorticoid. Usually, a clinical response is
seen at 16 weeks and lasts at least 6 months, after which
treatment can be repeated. Usually, response to re-treatment
is similar to the initial response.55
Response has been shown
to be related to the level of B cell depletion in the blood after
the first infusion; at 12 months, 59% of patients with com-
plete depletion of B cells (below 0.0001 × 109
/liter) still had
a moderate to good clinical response, compared to 21% of
patients with partial depletion.56
Vital et al demonstrated that
patients who were not clinically responding to rituximab at
6 months had higher B cell concentrations prior to treatment
than responders, and were less likely to achieve complete
depletion after the first infusion.57
When these nonresponders
were re‑treated with rituximab after 6 months 72% achieved
a clinical response.
An initial open-label phase IIa study by Edwards et al
assessed clinical response when rituximab was used alone
and in combination with MTX or cyclophosphamide, com-
pared to MTX alone.58
Cyclophophamide (750 mg on days
3 and 17) was used due to prior success of rituximab in
treatment of lymphoma in the CHOP regimen (cyclophosph-
amide, hydroxydoxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone).
At 24 and 48 weeks, greater numbers of patients achieved
ACR20 responses in all rituximab groups compared to MTX
alone, but the difference was only significant for rituximab in
­combination with MTX (Table 9).The percentage of patients
achieving a meaningful improvement in HAQ DI (decrease
of $0.22 from baseline) was greatest in the rituximab-MTX

Biologic therapy in rheumatoid disease
group (68% vs 39% and 43% in other rituximab groups
and 28% in the MTX monotherapy group). Follow-up was
­continued two years after rituximab treatment. In this time,
a number of patients discontinued from the study due to lack
of efficacy or relapse, and received alternative therapy or re-
treatment with rituximab. At two years, 45% of patients in
the rituximab-MTX group had not required further treatment,
compared to 22% in the rituximab plus cylophosphamide
group, 10% in the rituximab monotherapy group, and 15%
in the MTX-only group.
The DANCER trial investigated differing doses of
rituximab with MTX, with or without glucocorticoids, in
patients with active RA despite at least three months of
MTX treatment.53
Beyond 4 weeks, clinical response was
not significantly affected by glucocorticoid treatment, but
ameliorated acute infusion reactions. Therefore, results
were pooled according to rituximab dose. When results
for rheumatoid factor-negative patients were analyzed (85
out of 465 patients), rituximab showed no superior efficacy
over placebo (48% achieved ACR20 at 24 weeks compared
to 52% of controls), and their results were excluded from
the main analysis (Table 9). The proportion of patients
who had a meaningful decrease in HAQ DI ($0.22 from
baseline) was 67% with rituximab, compared to 34% in
controls.59
Patients enrolled in the REFLEX trial had active RA
despite three months of MTX treatment, and had failed
previous anti-TNF treatment, either due to lack of efficacy
(90% of patients) or intolerance.60
Rituximab had a signifi-
cant affect on HAQ DI (mean improvement of 0.4 compared
to 0.1 in controls; P , 0.0001), and on quality of life (mean
improvement in PCS was 5.8 vs 0.9, and MCS was 4.7 vs
1.3; P = 0.0002 for both scores). The effect of rituximab on
radiographic progression was assessed by comparing Genant-
modified Sharp scores at week 24 to baseline. A trend was
seen towards reduction of radiographic progression. However,
results did not reach statistical significance; mean change in
total score in the rituximab group was 0.6 compared to 1.2 in
controls (P = 0.169).
Il-6 inhibition: tocilizumab
Amongst its many roles, Il-6 is involved in differentiation
of B cells into plasma cells, and activation of T cells.61,62
­Tocilizumab is an antibody against the Il-6 receptor, i­nhibiting
Il-6 binding, and is produced from human ­immunoglobulin
and mouse antibody to the human Il-6 receptor by recom-
binant DNA technology. It is administered intravenously
every 4 weeks.
Tocilizumab was used alone and in combination with
MTX in the CHARISMA trial, in patients with an inadequate
response to MTX.63
The study showed the greatest number
of patients who achieved the primary endpoint (ACR20 at
20 weeks) were those treated with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus
MTX (74% compared to 41% in the placebo plus MTX
group; P = 0.001). This is the dose used in clinical practice.
Response with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg monotherapy was less
impressive (Table 10).
Furtherevidenceofefficacyoftocilizumabin ­combination
with MTX or other DMARDs is available (Table 10). The
OPTION study included patients with an inadequate response
to MTX. A small number had received previous anti-TNF
treatment (51 patients; 8%).64
The TOWARD study assessed
the combination of tocilizumab with other conventional
DMARDs in patients with active RA despite eight weeks of
treatment with DMARD therapy.65
Approximately 75% of
patients were receiving MTX as the concomitant DMARD.
Improved quality of life was seen in tocilizumab groups in
both studies, with statistically significant differences between
mean improvements from baseline in MCS and PCS scores
(P # 0.001).

Horton et al
RADIATE was a trial in RA patients who had received
one or more anti-TNF therapies in the previous year but
had failed treatment due to lack of efficacy or intolerance
(approximately half of patients had failed more than one
­anti-TNF).66
The results are similar to those seen with
­rituximab subsequent to failed anti-TNF in the REFLEX
study, with half of patients achieving an ACR20 response,
compared to 10% of patients on MTX alone.
Affect on radiographic progression was assessed in the
SAMURAI and LITHE studies.67,68
In the SAMURAI study,
patients with an inadequate response to DMARD therapy
were randomized to tocilizumab monotherapy or continuing
conventional DMARD treatment. At one year, the tocili-
zumab group showed less radiographic progression, with
a mean change in total Sharp score of 2.3 compared to 6.1
in the DMARD group (P , 0.01). The LITHE study was
a double-blind randomized controlled trial of tocilizumab
combined with MTX, compared to MTX monotherapy, in
MTX nonresponders. Again, the tocilizumab group showed
less progression, with mean change in total Genant-modified
Sharp score of 1.3 compared to 3.0 (P , 0.0001).
In MTX-naïve patients, theAMBITION study compared
efficacy of tocilizumab monotherapy to MTX.69
A signifi-
cantly higher proportion of patients receiving tocilizumab
achieved ACR20 response at 24 weeks (70% compared to
53%; P , 0.0001), and one third of patients achieved DAS28
remission, compared to 12% of patients receiving MTX.
For the purpose of analyzing long-term efficacy, patients
from these randomized controlled trials (OPTION,TOWARD,
RADIATE, LITHE, and AMBITION) were enrolled in
long-term extension studies, in which all patients receive
tocilizumab for up to five years, and are currently ­ongoing.
Interim results at 2.5 years have been published, showing
continued improvement of ACR responses over time, and
only 3% withdrawal rate due to lack of efficacy.70
Tolerability
In trials, rates of adverse events with anti-TNF treatments,
and discontinuation rates due to adverse events, are generally
comparable to rates seen in control groups. For example, the
ATTRACT study demonstrated that adverse events were as
common in all infliximab groups as in the placebo group.11
An adverse event was reported at least once in 80% of
patients. However, these were well-tolerated, causing the
discontinuation of treatment in 3%–7% of patients across
infliximab treatment groups, which compared to 8% in the
placebo group. Infusion reactions were more common with
infliximab (16%–20% compared to 10% in the placebo
group), but were usually mild and transient. In the STAR
study (SafetyTrial ofAdalimumab in RheumatoidArthritis),
patients were randomized to adalimumab or placebo, and
continued on their conventional DMARDs.71
There was no
significant difference in total adverse event rates (87% with
adalimiumab vs 83% with placebo), and when the type of
event was considered, a significant difference between groups
was only seen in injection site reactions (20% vs 12%), rash
(11% vs 6%), and back pain (5% vs 3%). The TEMPO trial
of etanercept as monotherapy and in combination with MTX
reported similar total adverse event rates (81% and 86%
respectively, compared to 81% with MTX monotherapy).21
In
terms of type of event, a significant increased incidence with
etanercept was only seen in injection site reactions.
Certolizumab and golimumab have been shown to dif-
fer from other anti-TNF therapies in that rate of injection
site reactions are not increased compared to controls. In
the FAST4WARD study, the rate of injection site reactions
was 5% with certolizumab compared to 14% with placebo.26
In GO-FORWARD the rate was 2% with golimumab com-
pared to 3% in controls.27
Trials have shown tolerability of abatacept is similar to
anti-TNF treatment in RA. For example, the total adverse
event rates in the AIM study were 87% with abatacept
­compared to 84% with placebo.44
The longest running
­open-label extension trial of abatacept treatment, by Kremer
et al reported a 17% discontinuation rate due to adverse
events over 5 years.48
With rituximab, the most frequent adverse events are
infusion reactions. These are reduced by premedication
with intravenous glucocorticoid, but remain common with the
first infusion of each course; acute infusion reaction occurred
in 29% of patients treated with two doses of 1000 mg
­rituximab in the DANCER study, and 23% of patients in the
REFLEX study.53,60
The rate decreases for the second infu-
sion (approximately 10%). Total adverse events occurred in
85% of patients receiving two doses of 1000 mg rituximab
in both DANCER and REFEX trials (compared to rates of
70% and 88% in placebo groups). They were largely well-
tolerated; adverse events led to withdrawal of treatment in
3% of patients in both trials.
In the largest randomized controlled trial of tocilizumab
(the TOWARD study of 1,220 patients), the incidence of
adverse events was higher in the tocilizumab group compared
to controls (73% compared to 61%). The majority of events
though were mild to moderate in severity and generally

Biologic therapy in rheumatoid disease
Safety of biologics
There are important safety issues with the use of biologic
therapy, not least because their targets in the immune ­system
have a role in the body’s defence against infection and
malignancy. Difficulties arise in assessing their safety, as
any increase in rates of malignancy and infection (both of
which are associated with RA) may reflect greater ­disease
severity and not biologic treatment. Evidence of their
safety is available from registries of patients receiving
biologics; for example, the British Society for Rheumatol-
ogy ­Biologics Register (BSRBR). This includes a control
group of 3,106 RA patients treated with DMARDs, but
these patients are likely to have less severe disease if they
have not required biologic therapy. Randomized controlled
­trials are generally not powered to detect rare adverse effects
such as malignancy. Meta-analyses of trials may go a way
towards solving this issue. However, it is important to note
that trials may exclude patients with co-morbidities, and
therefore their results may not apply to the general RA
population.
Infection
There is an increased risk of infection with biologic
therapy, and they are contraindicated in the presence of
active, severe infection. Risk of serious infection (infection
requiring intravenous antibiotics, or leading to hospitaliza-
tion or death) with biologic treatment is summarized in
Table 11.
There is an increased risk of tuberculosis (TB), either
reactivation of latent infection or increased susceptibil-
ity to infection. It can present atypically, for example, as
extra-pulmonary or miliary TB. Out of the 10,403 patients
on anti-TNF therapy in the BSRBR, there have been
35 cases of TB, with no cases in the DMARD group.76
There is a difference in risk within the group of anti-TNFs.
Adalimumab and infliximab (the monoclonal antibodies)
are associated with higher rates compared to the receptor
fusion protein etanercept. This may be due to differences
in their ­mechanism of action. The monoclonal antibodies
also inhibit T cell ­activation and the production of inter-
feron gamma, whereas the function of interferon gamma is
preserved with etanercept treatment.77
All patients should
be screened for latent infection prior to receiving anti-TNF.
The optimal treatment for latent TB prior to commencing
anti-TNF treatment has not been investigated in trials.
Observational data, for example, from the Spanish biologics
registry, reports that screening for TB and treatment with
isoniazid prior to anti-TNF therapy significantly decreases
the risk, but does not eliminate it.78
There is no evidence
that rituximab increases the risk of TB in clinical trials.
Trials excluded patients with active TB or latent TB on
chest X‑ray, but have not screened for latent TB by purified
protein derivative testing.
Anti-TNF treatments are contraindicated in chronic
­hepatitis B infection, as infliximab has been associated with
viral reactivation in a number of case reports.76
Etanercept is
considered to be safe in hepatitis C. A prospective study of
eight patients and a randomized controlled trial have shown
no increase in viral load or adverse events with etanercept.80,81
Hepatitis B reactivation has been reported after rituximab
treatment in lymphoma patients, but successful treatment
with prophylaxis has been possible. RA trials have screened

Risk of serious infection
Anti-TNF A meta-analysis of trials of infliximab and
adalimumab calculated the risk was approximately
double that with conventional DMARD
treatment (odds ratio 2.0; 95% confidence
interval: 1.3 to 3.1).72
A retrospective observational study of over 700
patients on anti-TNF compared the incidence of
serious infections on treatment to the incidence
in the same patients prior to treatment.73
Rates
of serious infection in the first year were 10 per
100 patient years compared to 3 per 100 patient
years prior to anti-TNF treatment.
The rate of serious infection from BSRBR data
was 6 per 100 patient years.74
When adjustment
was made for confounding factors such as
co-morbidities, this was not significantly different
from the rate in patients on conventional
DMARDs. However, when the incidence rate
over the first 90 days of anti-TNF treatment was
calculated, a four-fold increase in serious
infections was seen in this initial period of
treatment.
Abatacept In the open-label extension trials discussed
previously, the rate of serious infections was 3–5
per 100 patient years across the studies. 47–49
Rituximab In the DANCER and REFLEX trials, incidence of
serious infection was 5 per 100 patient years in
both trials (compared to rates of 3–4 per 100
patient years in control groups).53,60
Long-term
safety data with repeated treatments has shown
similar rates of serious infection for each cycle of
treatment.75
Tocilizumab In the TOWARD study, the rate of serious
infection was 6 per 100 patient years, compared
to 5 per 100 patient years with DMARD therapy
alone.65

for hepatitis B and C prior to treatment.Therefore, screening
for hepatitis B and C is recommended.54
There are case reports of fungal infections with anti-
TNF therapy, for example, histoplasmosis or aspergillosis,
although the incidence is extremely low.79
Malignancy
There is concern that anti-TNF and abatacept therapies may
put patients at risk of malignancy due to the role of TNF and
T cells in cancer immunosurveillance.
A meta-analysis of adalimumab and infliximab trials
has shown increased rates of malignancy compared to
placebo or placebo plus DMARD (pooled odds ratio 3.3;
95% ­confidence interval: 1.2 to 9.1). However, these trials
included high doses of infliximab (6 mg/kg every eight
weeks or more).72
Observational studies indicate that
anti-TNF therapy is associated with an increased risk of
nonmelanotic skin cancers but not solid tumor malignan-
cies. For example, a study of approximately 3,000 patients
treated with anti-TNF in the United States of America
reported an incidence rate of nonmelanotic skin cancer of
26 per 1,000 patient years, compared to 20 per 1,000 patient
years in patients treated with conventional DMARDs.82
A Swedish study reported a standardized incidence rate
of solid tumors of 0.9 in 4,000 RA patients on anti-TNF,
which compared to the standard incidence rate of 1.05 in
over 50,000 RA patients.83
However, anti-TNF may have
been avoided in patients at risk of malignancy, or with a
previous history of malignancy, because of a theoretical
risk. Data available from the BSRBR, of patients with a
history of previous malignancy, does not demonstrate any
increased cancer risk with anti-TNF.84
Anti-TNF treatment is contraindicated in patients with a
history of a lymphoproliferative disorder within the last five
years. There have been reports of higher incidence rates of
lymphoma in patients on anti-TNF therapies in comparison
to rates seen in the general RA population; for example,
the French RATIO registry data.85
In other cohort studies
however, such as the Swedish cohort described above, no
increase in incidence has been seen.86
With abatacept, a total of 42 malignancies were seen in
the 1,167 patients who were exposed to at least one dose
of abatacept in the open-label extension studies discussed
previously.47–49
The commonest types were nonmelanotic skin
cancers (21 cases), pulmonary malignancy (6 cases), and
lymphoma (3 cases).This incidence of pulmonary neoplasm
and lymphoma is similar to that in the RA population.
Anaphylaxis
Infliximab has a higher propensity than other anti-TNF
therapies to cause anaphylaxis, as it is a chimeric molecule,
but maybe also because it is administered intravenously. In
the START study (Safety Trial for Rheumatoid Arthritis
with RemicadeTherapy), 5 out of 1,442 patients treated with
infliximab developed serious infusion reactions.87
Rituximab, another chimeric molecule, is ­contraindicated
in patients who have had a hypersensitivity reaction to
­infliximab. In the REFLEX study, only two infusion ­reactions
out of 308 rituximab-treated patients were reported as severe,
one reaction being anaphylaxis, the other hypertension.60
Autoimmune syndromes and psoriasis
Anti-TNF therapy is associated with the production of
autoantibodies (antinuclear antibodies and double-stranded
DNA antibodies). Rarely, anti-TNF can cause ­autoimmune
hepatitis, vasculitis, and drug-induced systemic lupus
­erythematosus (occurring in approximately 0.2% of
patients).79
These conditions generally improve with drug
withdrawal. There are also reports of new-onset of skin
psoriasis and worsening of existing psoriasis on anti-TNF
therapy. There have been 25 new cases of psoriasis in
patients on anti-TNF treatment in the BSRBR, equivalent to
an incident rate of 1.04 per 1,000 patient years, compared to
no cases in patients on conventional DMARDs.88
Autoimmune syndromes have also been seen with
­abatacept. The extension studies reported vasculitis in
9 patients.47–49
Other, rarer events were sicca syndrome
(3 patients), erythema nodosum (2 patients), multiple scle-
rosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and sjögrens syndrome
(1 patient each). There were 16 new cases of psoriasis.
Neurological
Anti-TNF is contraindicated in patients with a history of
Parkinson’s disease or demyelinating conditions such as
optic neuritis or multiple sclerosis, and treatment should be
stopped if these disorders occur on treatment. Case reports
of development of demyelinating disorders on anti-TNF
therapy have been published.79
The role of anti-TNF therapy
in their causality is impossible to prove, but is suggested by
the fact that they generally improve, at least partially, on
drug withdrawal.
After treatment with rituximab, the very rare but usually
fatal condition of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopa-
thy has been seen. A review of cases from post-marketing
surveillance and published literature up until December 2008

Biologic therapy in rheumatoid disease
revealed 57 cases.89
Cases were in patients with known risk
factors for the disease, including lymphoma and treatment
with additional potent immunosupressants.This included one
patient with RA who had previously received chemotherapy
for oral malignancy.
Hematological
Pancytopenia and aplastic anemia while on anti-TNF therapy
have been reported.Again, it is difficult to conclude that this
is caused by anti-TNF treatment, as these cases are extremely
rare,79
but if these conditions develop, anti-TNF treatment
should be stopped.
Neutropenia is a complication of tocilizumab treatment.
In the TOWARD study, 29% of patients in the tocilizumab
group had neutrophil levels below the normal range, com-
pared to 4% of patients in the control group.65
Importantly,
neutropenia was not associated with any infection-related
adverse events. Only 4% had severe neutropenia (neutrophils
less than 500 per mm3
).
Cardiovascular
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have a higher incidence
of cardiovascular disease than the general population, with
a cardiovascular mortality rate of approximately 1.5 times
higher than the general population.2
Raised levels of inflam-
matory markers and cytokines are associated with increased
risk of cardiovascular disease, and research has shown levels
of TNF are increased in congestive heart failure. On this
basis, randomized controlled trials of etanercept in conges-
tive heart failure were conducted, but were terminated early
due to higher mortality rates with etanercept treatment.90
There are also reports of new-onset congestive heart fail-
ure and worsening of existing heart failure with anti-TNF
therapy (without other identifiable risks or precipitating
factors). Anti-TNF therapy is therefore contraindicated in
moderate to severe heart failure (New York Heart Associa-
tion class III or IV). Rituximab is also contraindicated in
severe heart failure (New York Heart Association class IV),
but data is not available in patients with heart failure in
classes I to III.70
Tocilizumab, by suppressing the effect of IL-6 on the
liver, is associated with increased lipid levels (which are sup-
pressed by inflammation). For example, the TOWARD study
revealed low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased to over
160 mg/dl in 16% of patients, compared to 3% of controls.65
Levels improve with lipid-lowering therapy. However, the
implication for long-term cardiovascular safety is uncertain.
Pregnancy
There is a lack of evidence for the safety of biologic therapy
in pregnancy and lactation. There is data available for
32 pregnancies in the BSRBR.91
Twenty three women were
receiving anti-TNF therapy at the time of conception, and
the majority (21 women) discontinued anti-TNF during the
first trimester. Of these 23 pregnancies, first trimester miscar-
riage occurred in 6, elective miscarriage in 3, and out of 14
live births there were no congenital malformations. Three of
the women who spontaneously miscarried were also taking
MTX, which makes this data difficult to interpret.
Discussion
Rheumatoid disease, being a chronic condition, requires
drug treatments that are effective, well-tolerated, and safe
over the long term. Although it is generally not ­immediately
life-threatening, it can lead to significant disability, job loss,
and systemic complications such as cardiovascular disease.
Benefits need to be balanced against potential risks of
­biologic treatments.
Patients and physicians need to be aware of the risks
with biologic treatment, which include an increased risk
of infection (all biologics), development of autoimmunity
(anti-TNF therapy and abatacept), and deterioration of
heart failure (anti-TNF and possibly rituximab). Prior to
­
treatment, patients should be fully assessed for potential risks.
­Screening for TB and hepatitis is recommended due to the
risk of reactivation with anti-TNF. The potential increased
risk of lymphoma with anti-TNF treatment remains unclear.
A history of a lymphoproliferative disease within the last
five years remains a contraindication to anti-TNF. Although
adverse event rates with biologic treatment are high in
­randomized studies, they are generally comparable to rates
with conventional DMARDs. The exception to this is infu-
sion or injection site reactions. However, these are mostly
well-tolerated and decrease over time, only infrequently
leading to drug discontinuation.
Biologic therapies are available for patients with RA
who are resistant to conventional DMARDs. Trials have
­demonstrated the efficacy of biologics over conventional
DMARDs in these circumstances, with greater proportions
of patients achieving ACR20 responses. For example,
one of the earliest trials, the ATTRACT study, showed
that patients were twice as likely to achieve an ACR20
response at one year with infliximab and MTX treatment
compared to MTX alone.12
This holds clinical meaning for
patients. An ACR20 is a composite endpoint that includes

­improvement in the number of swollen and tender joints,
but also the individual patient’s assessment of their pain,
health, and physical functioning. Trials have also reported
the proportion of patients achieving meaningful improve-
ment in physical functioning and health-related quality of
life. This perhaps carries more meaning for patients than
do reports of the average improvement in scores, which
could be affected by a dramatic improvement in a small
minority of patients. It should be noted that the majority of
studies discussed in this review are of patients with active
arthritis with high tender and swollen joint counts at enrol-
ment. In clinical practice, patients often have lower tender
and swollen joint counts. Therefore, the responses seen in
the trials discussed here may not be directly applicable to
a number of patients.
Several anti-TNF drugs have been developed, with differ-
ent methods of administration but similar efficacy.A range of
available anti-TNF therapies has been important for clinical
practice, as some patients develop side-effects specific to
certain drugs, and others may not respond or may lose their
initial response to therapy. In the latter, there is observational
evidence that switching to alternative anti-TNF is successful.92
In the case of golimumab, there is evidence from a random-
ized controlled trial.29
Other classes of biologics have proved
necessary because, in a proportion of patients, anti-TNF is
ineffective or is contraindicated; for example, in patients
with malignancy. Evidence for the use of the other classes
of biologics in anti-TNF nonresponders is available from
clinical trials of abatacept,46
rituximab,60
and tocilizumab.66
Approximately half of patients on these treatments were
achieving ACR20 responses at 6 months, which is striking,
considering these were patients with disease that had been
difficult to treat.
Efficacy of biologic treatments has been assessed in
patients recently diagnosed with RA who have not yet
failed conventional treatments such as MTX.13,17,23,33,50,69
These studies have shown that a greater proportion of
patients achieve the higher levels of improvement (ACR50
and ACR70 responses), and higher rates of clinical remis-
sion, with biologics compared to conventional DMARDs.
For example, the COMET study showed that patients were
nearly twice as likely to achieve remission with etanercept
and MTX compared to MTX alone after one year (remis-
sion rates of 50% compared to 28%).22
Improved rates of
remission in the early stages of disease may have important
consequences for the future in these individuals. For instance,
as onset of rheumatoid disease occurs most commonly in
middle age, any disruption of a person’s ability to work at
this stage could have implications for their later career. It
may also be important in preventing early joint damage,
which is more rapid in the early stages of the disease, and
so limit future disability from structural deformities. Both
of these aspects of efficacy of early biologic treatment have
been demonstrated; for example, reduction in job loss (in the
PROWD study)18
and prevention of structural damage (in the
COMET study).22
It has been suggested that early biologic treatment
may arrest the disease if used early in its course, and that
long-term remission after cessation of biologic treatment
may be ­achievable. For example, drug withdrawal was
most ­successful in the infliximab arm of the BeSt study;14
­sustained remission one year after withdrawal of infliximab
was achieved by Quinn et al in very early RA;33
and ­reduction
in rate of progression of undifferentiated arthritis to RA has
been seen six months after withdrawal of abatacept.52
As
discussed above, biologic therapies are not without any safety
concerns and are financially costly. Therefore, it has been
proposed that if biologic therapies were available as first-line
treatments in clinical practice, patients should be selected,
perhaps by predictors of poor prognosis.93
Initial financial
cost may be offset if biologic therapy enables more young
people to stay in work, reducing long-term healthcare costs
by preventing later disability and other consequences of RA
such as cardiovascular disease, and especially if drug-free
remission can be attained.
