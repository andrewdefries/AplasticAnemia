Background
Human parvovirus B19 (B19) is a ubiquitous and clinically significant pathogen, causing
erythema infectiosum, arthropathy, transient aplastic crisis, and intrauterine fetal death. The
phenotype of CD8þ
T cells in acute B19 infection has not been studied previously.
Methods and Findings
The number and phenotype of B19-specific CD8þ
T cell responses during and after acute
adult infection was studied using HLA–peptide multimeric complexes. Surprisingly, these
responses increased in magnitude over the first year post-infection despite resolution of clinical
symptoms and control of viraemia, with T cell populations specific for individual epitopes
comprising up to 4% of CD8þ
T cells. B19-specific T cells developed and maintained an
activated CD38þ
phenotype, with strong expression of perforin and CD57 and downregulation
of CD28 and CD27. These cells possessed strong effector function and intact proliferative
capacity. Individuals tested many years after infection exhibited lower frequencies of B19-
specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, typically 0.05%–0.5% of CD8þ
T cells, which were perforin,
CD38, and CCR7 low.
Conclusion
This is the first example to our knowledge of an ‘‘acute’’ human viral infection inducing a
persistent activated CD8þ
T cell response. The likely explanation—analogous to that for
cytomegalovirus infection—is that this persistent response is due to low-level antigen
exposure. CD8þ
T cells may contribute to the long-term control of this significant pathogen and
should be considered during vaccine development.

Introduction
Human parvovirus B19 (B19) is a ubiquitous, single-stranded
DNA virus. The 5.6-kb genome codes for only three major
proteins, the two overlapping capsid proteins VP1 and VP2
and the non-structural protein NS1. B19 targets immature
erythroid cells in the bone marrow after respiratory trans-
mission. Common manifestations of the infection are the
benign febrile illness erythema infectiosum followed by an
acute arthropathy (in approximately 5% of children and up to
50% of adult infections) that spontaneously resolves within 3
wk. Some adult patients who develop chronic arthritis can fulﬁl
the diagnostic criteria of rheumatoid arthritis [1,2]. Other
severe manifestations include transient aplastic crisis in
individuals with increased red cell turnover, and chronic
anaemia in immunocompromised patients. Furthermore,
infection during pregnancy is a major cause of fetal death.
Clinical resolution of acute infection is associated with the
emergence of antiviral IgG, which is maintained lifelong [3].
However, although antibodies are of importance, evidence for
an important role for cellular immune responses in the control
of B19 infection is also emerging. In some individuals with
apparently intact antibody responses, virus replication con-
tinues long term [4]. Readily detectable CD8þ
T cell responses
in three asymptomatic seropositive individuals have also been
observed [5]. CD8þ
T cells play an essential role in the control of
viral infections by direct killing of virus-infected cells and
through cytokine secretion. After a primary viral infection,
naı¨ve antigen-speciﬁc T cells expand clonally and undergo
several differentiation stages, followed by a contraction phase
mediated by apoptosis. Expression of the chemokine receptor
CCR7 on memory T cells has been used to divide this
population into central and effector memory subsets. CCR7þ
‘‘central’’ memory lymphocytes mostly home to secondary
lymphoid organs and have a high proliferative capacity in
response to antigen re-encounter. CCR7À
‘‘effector’’ memory
cells home to non-lymphoid organs and are capable of rapid
effector function [6]. Peptide–major histocompatibility com-
plex multimers can be used to further quantify and phenotype
T cells bearing T cell receptors of appropriate peptide/human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) speciﬁcity [7,8]. Amongst ‘‘effector’’
memory populations, a spectrum of phenotypes exists, as
assessed by surface expression of markers such as CD27, CD28,
and CD57, and intracellular expression of perforin. Amongst
the viral infections studied, cytomegalovirus (CMV) is associ-
ated with the emergence of the largest long-term memory
populations with the most ‘‘mature’’ phenotype, CD27/CD28
low, CD57 high, and often perforin positive [9]. The factors that
ultimately determine the phenotype and function of these
populations of lymphocytes are not fully understood, but
continued exposure to antigen is thought to be important.
Persistent infections such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), Epstein–
Barr virus (EBV), and HIV also show antiviral populations that
are ‘‘effector’’ (CD62L or CCR7 low), but show lower levels of
maturation than CMV-speciﬁc responses [7].
Its small stable genome and clear seroconversion illness
make B19 an ideal viral infection in which to study the
evolution of antigen-speciﬁc T cells longitudinally. Most other
signiﬁcant viruses in humans are either highly variable (HCV
and HIV) or have extremely large genomes (EBV and CMV). In
our previous analyses, we observed a surprisingly robust
response to B19 in three individuals with an asymptomatic
seropositive state [5]. We aimed in this study to deﬁne the
origins of such responses and track a range of antiviral
populations during and after acute disease.
Methods
Study Participants
Eleven previously healthy immunocompetent adults pre-
senting to their general practitioner with symptoms of fever,
arthralgia, fatigue, and rash were prospectively identiﬁed (B19
IgM-positive) at the Departments of Clinical Virology at the
Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals, Oxford, United Kingdom, and
Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. The two

Prolonged Activated CD8 Response to B19
cohorts were ascertained and studied independently. Clinical
details of the patients are shown in Table 1. The timing of
blood samples is given from onset of symptoms for both
cohorts. B19 DNA in serum was detected by nested PCR
amplifying 284 bp in the NS1 gene with a sensitivity of 103
DNA
copies/ml (Table 1) [5]. In addition, ﬁve healthy B19 IgG-
positive, B19 IgM/DNA-negative healthy laboratory volunteers
were studied as a ‘‘remotely infected’’ cohort. One gave a
history of acute rash and arthritis 10 y previously; the
remainder had no history suggestive of B19 infection and
were likely infected in childhood. No interferon-c (IFNc)– or
B19-speciﬁc T cells were detected in B19 IgG/IgM/DNA-
negative healthy controls (data not shown). Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated from heparinized
blood samples within 8 h of sampling, by gradient centrifuga-
tion on Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Swe-
den) or Lymphoprep (Fresenius Kabi Norge, Halden, Norway).
DNA was extracted from PBMCs using a QIAamp DNA Mini kit
(VWR International, Stockholm, Sweden) or PURGENE DNA
puriﬁcation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota,
United States). B19 IgM and IgG were tested using a
commercial EIA (Biotrin International, Dublin, Ireland).
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the local
ethical committee at Huddinge University Hospital, Karolin-
ska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, and from the Oxfordshire
Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CO2.113), Oxford,
United Kingdom, and informed patient consent was obtained.
HLA Tissue Typing
HLA class I genotyping was performed using multiplex PCR
on DNA extracted from PBMCs (ABC SSP Unitray, Dynal
Biotech, Oslo, Norway).
Generation of HLA–Peptide Multimeric Complexes
HLA–B19 peptide multimeric complexes were constructed
as previously described [10] and are listed in Table 2. Brieﬂy,
recombinant b2 microglobulin and HLA heavy chain (modi-
ﬁed by deletion of the transmembrane–cytosolic tail and
addition of a BirA enzymatic biotinylation site) were expressed
in BL21pLysS Escherichia coli. The resulting inclusion bodies
were puriﬁed and solubilized in urea, and refolded by limiting
dilution. Peptides were purchased (Biopeptide, San Diego,
California, United States) or synthesized by F-moc chemistry
and were of greater than 95% purity. The refolded complex
was then concentrated, buffer exchanged, biotinylated with
BirA enzyme, and puriﬁed by fast protein liquid chromatog-
raphy. HLA class I peptide complexes were stored at À80 8C.
Before staining, the monomers were tetramerized with
phycoerythrin or Alexa 647–labeled streptavidin (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, Oregon, United States) at a molar ratio of 1:4.
In addition, a Pro5 Pentamer containing the HLA-B*40
TEADVQQWL peptide conjugated to allophycocyanin was
purchased (ProImmune, Oxford, United Kingdom). Speciﬁcity
of the MHC monomers was conﬁrmed using T cell lines
established in vitro. When tested against non-HLA-matched
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines, no population was
detected (,0.02%; data not shown).
FACS Analysis
Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and washed twice with
RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, L-
glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and Hepes buffer at pH
7.5. In preliminary experiments, freshly isolated PBMCs were
stained in parallel with the same results. PBMCs (2.53105
cells)
were stained with the respective major histocompatibility
complex multimer and incubated for 20–30 min at 37 8C. After
two washes with PBE (2 mM EDTA and 0.05% BSA, in PBS [pH
7.4]), cells were co-stained with the appropriate monoclonal
antibodies for 15 min on ice, and ﬁxed in 1%–2% form-
aldehyde. Monoclonal antibodies used were directly conju-
gated and purchased ( Becton-Dickinson, Stockholm, Sweden).
Four-colour FACS was performed using ﬂuorochrome-
coupled anti-human CD3-, CD8-, CD27-, CD28-, CD38-,
CD45RA-, CD45RO-, CD57-, CD62L-, CCR7-, and perforin-
speciﬁc antibodies. For perforin staining, the cells were
permeabilized for 15 min using permeabilizing solution
(Becton Dickinson, Palo Alto, California, United States) before
staining with perforin monoclonal antibody. Cell acquisition
was performed with a four-colour FACS by using a FACSCa-
libur with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).
T Cell Lines and Functional Assays
PBMCs were pulsed with 50 lM of the respective epitope and
cultured at 23106
cells/ml in 24-well plates for 12–18 d. At day
three, 10 units/ml of IL-2 was added. Half of the medium was
replaced each third day with fresh medium containing 10 units/
ml of IL-2.
Ex Vivo IFNc ELISpots
IFNc ELISpots were performed as described previously [11].

peptide pools/PHA (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States).
Synthetic peptides, 15-mer, overlapping by ten amino acids
spanning the entire B19 protein sequence were used in pools of
ten at a ﬁnal concentration of 10 lM. IFNc responses were
conﬁrmed using individual peptides, with optimal epitopes
and HLA restriction identiﬁed by synthesis of truncated
peptides, prepulsing, and extensive washing of HLA-matched
and -mismatched target cells, and synthesis of HLA–peptide
multimeric complexes [12]. Using these techniques we con-
ﬁrmed previous epitopes in two independent cohorts, and
identiﬁed two new epitopes shown in Table 2, the nonamer
FYT restricted by HLA-A*24 and FPG restricted by HLA-B*35.
The latter is in addition to the HLA-B*35 epitope described
previously [5].
Intracellular Cytokine Staining
Short-term stimulation of PBMCs was carried out using
either peptide pools or individual peptides as previously
described [13]. Epitope HLA restriction required the pre-
pulsing of matched and mismatched PBMCs (from B19
seronegative individuals) with peptide at 20 lM for 1 h at
37 8C. Cells were washed and added to CTLs at a 10:1 ratio for
1 h before the addition of Brefeldin A.
Chromium Release Assay
CTLs were set up as described above. The cytolysis was
performed by killing of chromium-labelled targets as de-
scribed previously by Nixon et. al. [14] using LBL721.220
transfected with HLA-A*0201 as target cells.
Results
B19-Specific CD8þ
T cells Expand and Persist at High
Frequency Following Resolution of Acute Symptomatic
Infection
Eleven adults with acute B19 infection (ﬁve in Stockholm
cohort and six in Oxford cohort) and ﬁve remotely infected
seropositive individuals were studied. The clinical details,
symptom duration, and HLA types are shown in Table 1.
Surprisingly, in both cohorts (studied independently) the
frequency of B19-speciﬁc (multimer-positive) CD8þ
T cells in
peripheral blood samples continued to increase for many
months following symptom resolution. Figure 1A shows
representative staining from patient O3. The frequency of
A24 FYT tetramer-staining CD8þ
T cells increases up to 15 mo
after symptom presentation. Patient O3 presented with rash
and arthritis; however, symptoms resolved within 5 wk and
clinical examination was entirely normal at the time of the
second and subsequent venesections. Figure 1B and 1C show
the levels of multimer-positive CD8þ
T cells for the Oxford and
Stockholm cohorts of acutely infected individuals over time.
Only one sample was obtained for patient O6; all other
individuals were studied 2–7 times. All acutely infected
individuals showed B19-speciﬁc CD8þ
T cell percentages
ranging from 0.09% to 4.5% total CD8þ
T cells. The levels
rose for at least the ﬁrst 4 mo and frequently persisted for 12–
32 mo after symptom onset. The frequencies at 22 mo (or
nearest time point) were signiﬁcantly greater than at ﬁrst
sampling (Willcoxon rank sum test, p¼0.0020), and than those
observed for remotely infected seropositive individuals (Figure
1B; Mann–WhitneyU test, p ¼ 0.0022).
B19 DNA could be detected by nested PCR in serum for
different time periods (see Table 1). No B19 DNA could be
ampliﬁed from individuals in the remotely infected group.
IgG levels rose quickly and were maintained at a stable level
in patients studied (data not shown).
B19-Specific CD8þ
T Cells Remain Activated Following
Resolution of Acute Symptomatic Infection
In order to understand the origins and potential pathogenic
role of virus-speciﬁc CD8þ
T cells during and after acute
infection, we studied the activation phenotype of these cells ex
vivo. Figure 2 shows examples of T cell phenotypic marker
expression at early and late sample time points for three
different patients using three different B19 peptide–HLA
multimers. Figure 2A shows that HLA-B*40 TEA pentamer-
positive CD8þ
T cells from individual S2 are largely perforin
positive and CD62L negative, and that these changes become
more pronounced from the early (4 mo) to late (21 mo) time
points. Figure 3 shows sequential phenotypic data for all of the
acutely and remotely infected Oxford cohort. The upper left
panel shows that all acutely infected patients showed increases
in perforin expression on their B19-speciﬁc T cells over the
ﬁrst year following symptom development. By contrast, the
seropositive remotely infected individuals showed low levels of
perforin expression on tetramer-positive cells. These differ-
ences were statistically signiﬁcant (Mann–Whitney U test, p ¼
0.0079). Figure 4 shows sequential data from two individuals,
S1 and S2, of the Stockholm cohort, each studied with two
different HLA–peptide multimers at ﬁve or six time points
after acute presentation.
CD62L expression was found to be low at all time points in
the acutely infected cohort as well as in the remotely infected
cohort (see Figure 2A, lower panels; Figure 4, bottom panels;
data not shown). Figure 3 also shows that, for the Oxford
acutely infected cohort, CCR7 expression was low and fell over
the study period. B19-speciﬁc CD8þ
T cells from four of the ﬁve
remotely infected individuals had low CCR7 expression (see
Figure 3, bottom right panel).
Figure 2B (upper panels) shows the frequency of CD27
expression on A24 FYT tetramer-positive T cells for patient
O3. Figure 3 (upper right panel) shows the data from all of the
Oxford cohort. CD27 was downregulated over time in acutely
infected individuals. Three of the remotely infected individ-
uals had high levels of CD27 expression on their tetramer-
positive populations, while two had slightly lower levels, with
only approximately 50% of tetramer-positive cells expressing
CD27. B19-speciﬁc T cells from the acutely infected individuals
also showed downregulation of the CD28 marker over time.
This is shown for individual O3 in Figure 2B (bottom panels).
Two months after symptom onset, 86% of multimer-positive
cells expressed CD28, while at 20 mo only 4% of multimer-

shows a similar pattern of CD28 downregulation over time for

(data not shown). By contrast, B19-speciﬁc CD8þ
T cells from
remotely infected individuals were predominately CD28þ
. The
T cells 20 mo post-infection in acutely infected individuals
expressed signiﬁcantly lower CD28 than in the remotely

as shown for the Oxford cohort in Figures 2C and 3 and for
two individuals of the Stockholm cohort in Figure 3.
Strikingly, for one patient, O3, there was a dramatic fall in
CD38 expression at 27 mo compared to the 20-mo time point.
Figure 4 shows the sequential CD38 expression of multimer-
positive T cells of two speciﬁcities for Stockholm patients S1
and S2. S1 shows ﬂuctuations over a period of over 32 mo; S2
shows a gradual decline in CD38 expression from high levels
over a comparable period.
CD57 expression levels increased over time in almost all
acutely infected individuals. This is shown for one Oxford
individual in Figure 2C, for the Oxford acutely infected cohort
in Figure 3 (bottom left panel), and for two of the Stockholm
cohort in Figure 4. Thus, for individual S2 (Figure 4) a high
level of CD57 expression was maintained at 30 mo, the last time
point tested. By contrast, Figure 3 (bottom left panel) shows
that remotely infected individuals have low levels of CD57
expression on their B19-speciﬁc CD8þ
T cells. T cells 20 mo
post-infection in acutely infected individuals expressed sig-
niﬁcantly higher CD57 than in the remotely infected cohort
(Mann–Whitney U test, p ¼ 0.0043).
Differing Patterns of CD45 Isoform Expression Follow
Acute B19 Infection
CD45 isoform expression showed variation between indi-
viduals. Most acutely infected patients from the Stockholm and
Oxford cohorts expressed high levels of CD45RO within a few
months of symptom onset, with variable downregulation over
time (data not shown). In the remotely infected cohort, three
individuals expressed high levels of CD45RO on tetramer-
positive cells. Two of these individuals, however, had only just
over 50% of their tetramer-positive cells expressing CD45O
(data not shown). CD45RA was downregulated in some patients
in the Oxford cohort, whereas in the Stockholm cohort the
B19-speciﬁc CD8þ
cells during the entire study period
generally expressed high frequency of CD45RA (data not
shown).
B19-Specific CD8þ
T Cells Have Efficient Effector Function
Figure 5A shows that PBMCs from patient O1 at the 2-mo
time point are capable of immediate IFNc release on
stimulation with the FYTPLADQF peptide. The number of
IFNc-releasing T cells corresponds to approximately 0.3% of
CD8 T cells (since at this time point, 40% of PBMCs were
CD8þ
). At this time point, 1.6% of CD8þ
cells were stained with
the A24 FYT tetramer (Figure 5A, right panel). Thus, the
numbers of cells capable of immediate IFNc secretion were
approximately 5-fold lower than the numbers of tetramer-
staining cells. Figure 5B shows that B40-restricted TEA-speciﬁc
T cells from patient S2 (at 30 mo) were able to proliferate
rapidly in vitro on stimulation with peptide. After 12 d, 90% of
surviving CD8þ
T cells were B40 TEA-speciﬁc. B19-speciﬁc T
cell lines were capable of rapid IFNc production, as assessed by
intracellular cytokine release assay (data not shown).
Lastly, we studied the function of B19-speciﬁc CD8þ
T cells
from remotely infected individuals (who in all cases had no
symptoms attributable to possible B19 infection for at least 5
y). Figure 5C shows that these cells were capable of direct ex
vivo IFNc release on 18 h culture with GLCPHCINV or
TEADVQQWL peptides. A T cell line derived by culture of
OR1 PBMCs with peptide in vitro was capable of HLA-A*0201-
restricted B19-peptide-speciﬁc cytolysis (Figure 5D).
Discussion
In this study we observed, to our knowledge for the ﬁrst time,
a striking pattern of evolving, long-lived CD8 immune
responses against B19 in 11 adults with primary B19 infection.
Although the symptoms of this virus are generally short-lived
and the virus is not classically regarded as persistent, the
immune responses showed a sustained activated state many
months after initial infection. This pattern was observed in a
range of patients in two different clinical centres and appears
to represent a new and distinct style of host–virus relationship.
This is the ﬁrst example to our knowledge of an ‘‘acute’’ human
viral infection inducing persistent activated CD8 T cell
responses.
The CD8þ
T cell responses tracked here were mapped using a
comprehensive screening system facilitated by the compact
and stable viral genome of B19. The virus has only one NS gene,
which appears to be the major target of CD8þ
T cell responses
during acute disease, with a range of epitopes identiﬁed [5,12].
HLA-A2-restricted epitopes were commonly targeted, but,
interestingly, no clear-cut dominance of one over the other was
consistently seen, in contrast to infections such as CMV and
HIV [15,16]. CTL responses to HLA-A2 and non-HLA-A2
epitopes showed similar kinetics, frequencies, and phenotypes.
Thus, future studies might reasonably track deﬁned epitopes,
rather than requiring individual mapping, as is the case in, for
example, HCV [17–19].
We used, to our knowledge for the ﬁrst time, HLA–peptide
multimeric complexes to detect CD8þ
T cell responses during
acute B19 infection. Surprisingly, these continued to increase
in magnitude at later time points, long after resolution of acute
symptoms. In some cases, these responses reached high levels in
blood, and were sustained over many months. Even responses
of lower frequency appeared to show this delayed expansion.
This differs to responses to almost all other human viruses
studied in such detail. Responses to HIV and HCV are strong in
acute infection, but typically decline as virus is controlled [20].
EBV-speciﬁc responses to latent antigens may increase over
time [21]. Few data exist on acute CMV infection in
immunocompetent humans, but in murine infection, a
phenomenon of ‘‘memory inﬂation’’ is seen for some but not
all epitopes [22–24]. Here, responses showed gradual accumu-
lation over time after a short acute response and a lag period of
about 8–10 wk after acute infection. The current study did not
have the resolution to determine whether B19-speciﬁc
responses were biphasic in this manner, although in the mouse
such phenomena may differ substantially between different
virus preparations, doses, and experimental settings.
The B19-speciﬁc T cell populations underwent contraction
1.5–2 y after acute infection. The kinetics of this contraction
were not deﬁned in this study, but ‘‘remotely infected’’
individuals, who had no recent history of infection, and in
some cases may have been primarily infected as long ago as 30 y
previously, showed smaller populations of B19-speciﬁc T cell
populations . However, as we have noted previously, B19-
speciﬁc CTLs are readily detectable—often much larger than
equivalent responses to viruses such as inﬂuenza and com-
parable to some EBV-speciﬁc responses [5]. A single individual
who had a documented B19 infection 10 y previously showed
populations of a size and phenotype (see below) similar to the
other remotely infected persons.

Prolonged Activated CD8 Response to B19
antiviral responses, we also observed continued maturation of
B19-speciﬁc CD8þ
T cells in the cohorts of acutely infected
individuals studied. This expansion was consistent across a
range of markers, all of which have been linked to the evolution
of antiviral ‘‘effector’’ memory cells against persistent virus
infections. Consistent with these data is the ﬁnding of
sustained CD8 effector function of the Swedish cohort over
time, as evidenced by IFNc production in response to viral
peptides [12]. Antiviral T cell responses to CMV have been
extensively studied and are typically regarded as exhibiting a
‘‘mature’’ phenotype associated with loss of expression of co-
stimulatory molecules CD27 and CD28, sustained loss of lymph
node homing markers CD62L and CCR7, and generally
positive expression of intracellular perforin [7,25–27]. A
particular feature of these cells is sustained expression of
CD57, which is considered to be a marker of terminally
differentiated cells [20]. Although there are substantial differ-
ences between individuals, many groups report re-expression
of CD45RA on such highly differentiated cells [28–31]. All of
these features were clearly reproduced in the B19-speciﬁc
responses tracked in the months following acute infection.
Interestingly, the gradual evolution of responses from a CD28þ
to CD28À
status, in concert with changes in other markers,
could be clearly tracked over time. These phenotypic changes
have not been extensively investigated in human CMV, but in
murine CMV, CD28 loss does appear to occur relatively early,
and to be subsequently maintained in the immunodominant
populations [32].
It is generally considered likely, although not proven, that
such marker evolution represents a maturation pathway,
driven by restimulation in vivo with antigen. The nature or
duration of the encounter, coupled with the survival of
antigen-speciﬁc cells, may lead to the typical appearances of
T cells speciﬁc for different persistent virus infections [7,25].
The ﬁndings that not only are the cells phenotypically mature
but also strongly activated in vivo (CD38þ
), is consistent with
continuous encounter with antigen over the post-infection
period. This period of restimulation appears to be sustained,
but, unlike in CMV, appears to wane over time, perhaps after
1.5–2 y. Eventual disappearance of antigen would be consistent
with the relatively less differentiated phenotype seen in
remotely infected individuals. Nevertheless, although such
populations are smaller in size, less activated, and less mature,
they retain a CD62L-low phenotype. Murine T cell populations
that exist in the absence of antigen typically show slow
reversion to a CD62L-high state [33], even in the case of CMV
[32]. Thus antigenic drive may be reduced but would appear to
be still sufﬁcient to maintain an ‘‘effector’’ memory T cell
population.
The striking features of the T cell responses to B19 infection
indicate persistence of antigen long after the resolution of
acute infection. The status of the virus in the post-acute period
is not fully understood. Direct nucleic acid analysis has
revealed loss of detection in blood after 3 wk in infected
volunteers [3], although this may be prolonged in some cases
[4]. Nested PCR analysis in our study revealed the presence of
B19 DNA in blood at early time points during acute infection,
but such assays were negative at time points 6–12 mo after
infection, when T cell populations remained activated. It is
possible that B19 persists, in the blood and other sites
including bone marrow, joints, or skin. Detection of B19
DNA in the bone marrow of asymptomatic remotely infected
volunteers has been reported [3]. The ﬁnding of parvovirus in
skin remains restricted to a single study of a speciﬁc genotype
distinct from the genotype 1 strains found in our study
participants [34]. Low-level, contained replication at a tissue
site for weeks or months after infection does seem like the most
likely explanation for the immune responses seen, and more
sensitive quantitative PCR assays are being validated to address
this question. It is also possible that viral antigen is retained, for
example, on follicular dendritic cells, following the extremely
high burden seen acutely. Alternatively subgenomic particles
may be generated in the post-acute period, in the absence of
full viral replication. Parvovirus is not thought to establish true
latency or integrate into the host genome, so the mechanism
behind this low-level persistence remains to be explored.
The relationship between joint or bone marrow pathology
and the T cell responses seen is not clear. Indeed, since the most
active CD8þ
T cell responses were seen at stages where joint
symptoms had resolved, these T cell responses are unlikely to
be directly involved. It remains an open and interesting
question, however, whether these or perhaps CD4þ
T cells are
involved in the prolonged inﬂammatory arthritis seen in a
proportion of cases. A previous study did identify an HLA
association with B19-induced arthritis syndrome, suggesting a
signiﬁcant role for cellular immune responses [1]. All our
patients presented—as is common in adults—with joint
symptoms, and in principle an acutely infected but asympto-
matic group would provide an ideal comparison to address
such a question. It is also possible that the CTL responses seen
might be involved in immune-mediated pathology in the bone
marrow. Although the virus itself may lead to direct death of
the critical progenitor cells, in other settings vigorous T cell
responses can also contribute importantly to marrow sup-
pression through lytic and non-lytic pathways [35].
In summary, this is the ﬁrst demonstration to our knowledge
of a virus not thought to cause true or classical persistent
infection leading to a persistent activated CD8þ
T cell
response. Responses of this quantity and quality (i.e., CD27
and CD28 low and CD57 and perforin high) have only
previously been seen for infection with CMV, a virus known
to establish persistent infection. Our data suggest that B19
persists in some form after acute infection, and provokes
sustained activated CD8þ
T cell responses, which might
ultimately play a role in viral clearance. Deﬁning the role of
CTLs in this setting will be of value not only in expanding
further our understanding of the role of T cells in acute and
persistent viral infections but also in vaccine design and in
immunotherapy, as has been applied to treatment of EBV and
CMV infections in immunosuppressed individuals. B19 is a
small virus and attracts relatively little attention from
clinicians and immunologists [36], but clearly attracts a great
deal of attention from the immune system. Now that progress
has been made in the deﬁnition of the kinetics and antigenic
targets of these immune responses, further studies in speciﬁc
clinical settings where the virus remains a signiﬁcant problem
could readily redress this balance.

Patient Summary
Background Parvovirus B19 is a small virus that is very common. Usually
it causes mild symptoms of fever and a typical ‘‘slapped cheek’’ rash on
the face, which may then spread; in around one in 20 children, and one
in two adults it can also cause joint pain. Other, more serious
complications occur in people whose red cells do not last as long as
usual, for example, people with sickle cell disease; these people can get a
severe aplastic anemia—the bone marrow stops making blood
completely for a time. The virus can also cause fetal death if a woman
contracts it while pregnant.
Why Was This Study Done? It is not clear how the body’s defenses—
immune system—work to clear this virus. There is some evidence that in
some people the virus might continue to divide in the body for a long
time after the first infection. The authors wanted to study one part of the
immune system—T cells—in people who had just recently been infected
with the virus and compare the findings with people who had had the
infection a long time previously.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find? They compared findings from
two groups of people: 11 who had recently had the infection (six from
Oxford and five from Stockholm) and five who had had the virus many
years previously. They found that over the year following the infection,
one particular type of T cell continued to increase in numbers and
responsiveness to the B19 virus, despite the fact that the patients’ clinical
symptoms had gotten better.
What Do These Findings Mean? It seems the virus remained in the
patients’ bodies for a considerable time after they appeared to have
recovered, and the virus continued to stimulate T cells to respond to it.
These results may be useful in designing a strategy to develop a vaccine
for this virus.
