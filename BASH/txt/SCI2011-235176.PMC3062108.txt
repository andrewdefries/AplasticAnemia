Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the main curative therapy for many hematologic malignancies. Its potential
relies on graft-versus-tumor eﬀects which associate with graft-versus-host disease. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) possess
immunomodulatory properties that make them attractive therapeutic alternatives. We evaluated the in vitro immunosuppressive
activity of medium conditioned by human MSCs from 5 donors expanded 13 passages with or without FGF-2. FGF-2
supplementation increased expansion 3,500- and 240,000-fold by passages 7 and 13, respectively. There were no diﬀerences in
immunosuppressive activity between media conditioned by passage-matched cells expanded under diﬀerent conditions, but media
conditioned by FGF-treated MSCs were superior to population doubling-matched controls. The immunosuppressive activity was
maintained in three of the preparations but decreased with expansion in two. The proliferation induced by FGF-2 did not result
in loss of immunosuppressive activity. However, because the immunosuppressive activity was not consistently preserved, caution
must be exercised to ensure that the activity of the cells is suﬃcient after extensive expansion.
1. Introduction
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
is the only curative therapy for many hematologic malignan-
cies. Part of the therapeutic beneﬁt of allogeneic HSCT is
based on graft-versus-tumor (GVT) eﬀects, which eradicate
residual malignant cells through immunologic mechanisms.
Unfortunately, GVT is closely associated with the develop-
ment of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [1], which is one
of the primary causes of transplant-related mortality [2].
Less than half of patients that develop severe acute GVHD
respond to ﬁrst-line corticosteroid therapy [3, 4]. Patients
with steroid-resistant GVHD require secondary therapy to
which only half of these patients respond and have overall
poor survival [2, 5]. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches
to prevent and treat GVHD are urgently needed. Cellular
therapies are emerging as promising approaches to treat and
even to prevent immune-aberrant diseases such as GVHD.
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are nonhematopoi-
etic multipotent cells capable of diﬀerentiating into both
mesenchymal and nonmesenchymal lineages [6–8]. MSCs
also produce cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix
proteins that support in vitro hematopoietic stem cell
(HSC) survival and proliferation and facilitate in vivo HSC
engraftment [9]. A substantial body of evidence suggests that
MSCs are capable of inhibiting T-lymphocyte activation and
proliferation in vitro [10–14]. Additionally, MSCs appear to
be immunoprivileged and to escape immune surveillance
2 Stem Cells International
eliciting only weak responses upon rechallenges [15, 16].
These characteristics make MSCs very attractive as cellular
therapeutic agents [17, 18].
Human MSC (hMSC) preparations have signiﬁcant,
though variable and ﬁnite, proliferative potential [19]. This
variability may be due to exogenous factors such as the
method used to obtain the bone marrow [20–24], speciﬁcs
of the serum lots used, and intrinsic factors such as the
age of the donor [21, 25]. Despite their high proliferative
potential, extensive culture expansion may result in loss of
diﬀerentiation potential and the onset of senescence [21].
Interestingly, the senescence-related loss of potential is not
generalized; for example, MSCs maintain their osteogenic
potential through extensive subcultivation [20, 21], but
lose their ability to diﬀerentiate into adipocytes [21] as
they approach senescence. Their ability to diﬀerentiate into
chondrocytes is lost in earlier passages [26].
Several published reports have demonstrated that ﬁbrob-
last growth factor-2 (FGF-2) exerts a signiﬁcant mitogenic
eﬀect on MSCs while, simultaneously, enhancing their tri-
lineage (bone, cartilage, fat) diﬀerentiation capacity [27–32].
Chondrogenesis, perhaps the diﬀerentiation potential most
easily lost in MSCs during in vitro culture, is particularly
improved by expansion in FGF-2-supplemented medium
[30, 31].
Little is known, however, about the maintenance or loss
of the immunomodulatory activity of hMSCs through exten-
sive expansion or the impact that FGF-2 supplementation
might have on this MSC property. The purpose of these
experiments was to characterize the immunosuppressive
activity of MSCs expanded in vitro for diﬀerent periods
of time with and without FGF-2 supplementation which,
as stated above, has been shown to be beneﬁcial for the
maintenance of other hMSC functions.
2. Material and Methods
All cells were isolated from normal healthy human donors at
the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Core Facility of the Compre-
hensive Cancer Center of Case Western Reserve University
after informed consent was obtained under the terms of
an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. Periph-
eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from
peripheral blood collected into heparinized blood collection
tubes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Human MCSs were isolated
from bone marrow aspirates obtained from the posterior
superior iliac crest into a preheparinized 20-mL syringe
(BD). The PBMCs and hMSCs used in these studies were
isolated from diﬀerent, unrelated donors.
2.1. Isolation of Human PBMCs. Ten human PBMC prepa-
rations were used in these studies. The blood was carefully
layered on top of Ficoll (GE Healthcare, Pisctatway, NJ) and
the tubes centrifuged at 800 ×g for 30 minutes without brake.
After centrifugation, a sterile plastic pipette was used to
aspirate the mononuclear cell layer and transfer it into a fresh
50 mL conical tube (BD). The PBMCs were then washed
twice with phosphate buﬀered saline (PBS, Invitrogen, Carls-
bad, CA), counted, and resuspended in complete Roswell
Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium composed
of RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-
inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen).
2.2. Isolation of Human MSCs. Five hMSC preparations were
used in this study. The procedures for establishing human
bone marrow-derived MSC cultures followed previously
published methods [33, 34]. Brieﬂy, bone marrow aspirates
were washed with control medium consisting of low glucose
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM-LG, Invitro-
gen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) from
a selected lot (Hyclone, Logan, UT) [34]. Serum lot selection
is a standard procedure performed prior to purchasing a
new shipment of serum; all experiments were conducted
with serum from a single lot. They were then centrifuged
on a Percoll (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) density
gradient to isolate mononuclear cells. The mononuclear cells
were washed with control medium and seeded at a density of
1.8 × 105
cells/cm2 in control medium to establish primary
cultures. All cell culture was done at 37◦
C in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.
2.3. Establishment of Study Groups. At the ﬁrst medium
change (day 4), and in every medium change thereafter,
some of the plates received control medium, and the rest
of the plates received the same medium supplemented with
10 ng/mL of FGF-2 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). The dose
was chosen based on previous studies [31]. Cultures were fed
twice per week.
2.4. Expansion of hMSCs. hMSCs must be subcultured
before the cells become conﬂuent in order to keep their
growth at an exponential rate and prevent spontaneous dif-
ferentiation or loss of diﬀerentiation potential [6, 35]. Typ-
ically, they were passaged when the cultures were 80−90%
conﬂuent. Primary cultures were usually subcultured at 14
± 3 days. Subsequently, the cells were subcultured approx-
imately every 7 ± 2 days. Plates assigned to the diﬀerent
study groups (control or FGF-treated) were subcultured at
the same time, which resulted in diﬀerent levels of conﬂuence
in the treatment groups as result of the previously reported
diﬀerences in cell proliferation and cell size [31]. In all
cases, control cultures were less conﬂuent than their FGF-
treated counterparts at the time of subcultivation. Cells were
subcultured by trypsinization, counted, and reseeded at 4.5
× 103 cells per cm2.
2.5. Cryopreservation of hMSCs. Subcultured cells were
centrifuged at 200 ×g for 5 minutes; the supernatant
was discarded, and the cells resuspended in cold freezing
medium consisting of 90% FBS (Invitrogen) and 10% DMSO
(Sigma Chemical Co.) at a density of 106 cells/mL. The cells
were aliquoted into cryogenic storage vials (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Rochester, NY), the vials placed in a freezing
container (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), and the container
placed at −80◦
C overnight. The vials were then transferred
to the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen freezer.

2.6. Recovery of Cryopreserved hMSCs. Vials containing
approximately 1.0−1.5×106
cryopreserved cells were thawed
quickly in a 37◦
C water bath and transferred into a 15-
mL conical tube containing 5 mL of either control or FGF-
supplemented medium, as appropriate. The tubes were then
centrifuged at 200 ×g for 5 minutes. After centrifugation the
supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in
either control or FGF-supplemented medium and seeded at
4.5 × 103 cells per cm2.
2.7. Characterization of hMSCs. The hMSC phenotype
was conﬁrmed by forward and side-scatter pattern as
well as monoclonal antibody (MAb) staining (CD45−
,
CD73+, CD105+). Brieﬂy, approximately 500,000 hMSCs
were washed and resuspended in HBSS supplemented with
1% FBS containing 5 mM EDTA. hMSCs were then incu-
bated with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated
anti-CD45 MAb (BD), phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-
CD73 MAb (BD), and allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated
anti-CD105 MAb (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). After 30-
minute incubation at 4◦
C, MAb-labeled cells were washed
three times and then ﬁxed in 2% paraformaldehyde prior
to analysis. Isotype control immunoglobulins were used as
negative controls for staining. At least 20,000 events were
analyzed per conjugated MAb stain condition.
To assess their chondrogenic potential [36–38], passaged
cells were resuspended in a chemically deﬁned chondrogenic
medium. Aliquots containing 2.5 × 105 cells were placed in
polypropylene multiwell plates, centrifuged at 500 ×g, and
placed in the incubator. Medium was changed three times
per week. On days 7, 14, and 21 aggregates were harvested
and processed for histologic evaluation.
To verify their osteogenic potential [20, 39, 40] hMSCs
were seeded at a density of 5 × 103 cells/cm2 in control
medium and allowed to attach overnight. The next day, the
culture medium was replaced with osteogenic medium. Cul-
ture medium is changed twice per week. Osteogenic cultures
are further supplemented with 2 mM β-glycerophosphate
starting on day 10. Triplicate cultures were stained for
calcium deposition (von Kossa) [41] on days 14, 21, and 28.
The adipogenic potential of hMSCs was also tested [42];
passaged cells aliquots containing 2.5 ×105 cells were placed
in polypropylene multiwell plates in adipogenic induction
medium in multiwell plates, centrifuged at 500 ×g, and
placed in the incubator. Medium was changed three times per
week. On day 10, the medium was replaced with adipogenic
maintenance medium. Cells were harvested for histologic
analysis on days 7, 14, and 21.
2.8. Generation of hMSC-Conditioned Media. hMSCs at
diﬀerent passage numbers were seeded into 6-well plates
(BD), at a density 15 × 103 cells/cm2 in complete hMSC
medium. After overnight incubation, the medium was
removed and a 2-mL aliquot of complete RPMI containing
either PBMCs (0.5 × 106 cells/mL) or interleukin-1 beta (IL-
1β) (5 pg/mL, Peprotech) was added to each well. Control
wells received only complete RPMI. Another set of control
wells was incubated without hMSCs, but still received either
PBMCs or IL-1β. After a 24-hour incubation period, the
conditioned media were collected into 2-mL microcentrifuge
tubes and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 12,000 ×g to remove
any remaining cells. The cell-free supernatants were then
transferred to clean microcentrifuge tubes and either used
fresh or frozen at −80◦
C for later use.
2.9. Assessment of Cell Expansion. All cell counts during the
expansion phase were done manually on the trypsinized cell
suspensions, in triplicate using a Neubauer hemocytometer.
Population doublings were calculated as the base-2 logarithm
of the number of cells obtained at the end of a given passage
divided by the number of cell seeded.
For primary cultures, the number of colonies formed in
primary culture we used as the denominator assuming that
one colony is derived from one MSC.
2.10. Interferon-Gamma ELISpot Assay. The immunosup-
pressive activity of hMSCs and their conditioned media
was tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays
(ELISpot) [43]. The ELISpot assay allows visualization of the
secretory product of individual responding cells; each spot
that develops in the assay represents a single reactive cell.
Thus, the assay provides both qualitative (type of immune
protein) and quantitative (number of responding cells)
information. ELISpot assays are highly sensitive because the
product is rapidly captured around the secreting cell before
it is diluted in the supernatant, captured by receptors of
adjacent cells, or degraded. The assay has gained a recent
increase in popularity, especially as a surrogate measure for
cytotoxic T-cell responses in large part because it is both
reliable and highly sensitive [44].
Ninety-six well ELISpot plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA)
were coated with antihuman interferon-gamma (IFNγ)
antibody (Pierce, Rockford, IL); 100 μL of antibody solution
(4 μg/mL in PBS) were added to each of the 96 wells
of the plate and incubated overnight in the refrigerator.
The plate was then washed with PBS and blocked at
37◦
C for 2 hours with complete RPMI. The wells then
received either 150 μL of complete RPMI (control wells) or
150 μL of either a 106 cells/mL hMSC suspension or hMSC-
conditioned medium (experimental wells). Then, 25 μL of
complete RPMI were added to the negative control wells,
and 25 μL of phytohemagglutinin (PHA, Sigma Chemical
Co) solution (40 μg/mL in complete RPMI) were added to
experimental and positive control wells. A 25-μL aliquot
of PBMC suspension (6 × 106 cells/mL) was ﬁnally added
to each well, and the plate was incubated for 24 hours at
37◦
C. After the incubation, the plate was washed with PBS
+ 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma Chemical Co.). Biotinylated anti-
IFNγ antibody (Pierce) (2 μg/mL in PBS + 0.05% Tween
20 + 1% BSA (Sigma Chemical Co.) was added and the
plate incubated at 37◦
C for 2 hours. After washing the
plate with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20, Streptavidin-Horseradish
Peroxidase (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1 : 1,000 in
PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 + 1% BSA was added and the plate
incubated for 1 hour. After 3 washes with PBS + 0.05%
Tween 20 followed by 4 washes with PBS the IFNγ-positive

spots were developed with 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole (AEC)
(Pierce). The reaction was then stopped with tap water, and
the plates were allowed to dry in the dark. The plates were
analyzed with a computer-assisted ELISpot analyzer (Cellular
Technology Inc., Cleveland, OH). Percent inhibition was
obtained by direct comparison to the corresponding positive
control indicated above.
2.11. Statistical Analyses. The statistical signiﬁcance of the
diﬀerences in proliferation rates and of the diﬀerences
between PBMC and IL-1β stimulation was determined by
paired t-tests. Analysis of the eﬀect of time-in-culture on the
immunosuppressive activity was performed by one-factor
repeated measurements ANOVA followed by paired t-tests
to identify the diﬀerences between passages. The analysis of
the eﬀect of FGF supplementation was performed by paired
t-tests, and diﬀerences were considered signiﬁcant for P
values < .05.
3. Results
3.1. Cell Expansion. As in previous studies, hMSCs expanded
in the presence of FGF-2 exhibited higher proliferation
rates than those expanded in control conditions [31]. The
population doubling time for hMSCs expanded in the
presence of FGF-2 was consistently shorter than that of cells
expanded under control conditions at any passage (P < .01)
as indicated by the slope of the growth curves in Figure 1.
By passage 13, control MSCs reached on average 26.3 ±
4.7 population doublings (PDs), while FGF-treated cells
reached 44.2 ± 3.9 PDs. FGF-treated hMSCs reached 28.0
± 2.6 PDs (the maximum expansion obtained with control
cells) around passage 6 in approximately 35 days. Control
or FGF-treated cells were subcultured at the same time,
causing diﬀerent levels of conﬂuence, a consequence of the
diﬀerences in cell proliferation and cell size [31]. Control
cultures were never more conﬂuent than their FGF-treated
counterparts at any time of subcultivation.
3.2. Cell Characterization. hMSCs isolated from bone mar-
row exhibited the typical characteristics of multipotent
hMSCs [45], that is, characteristic morphology, surface
marker proﬁle (not shown), and trilineage diﬀerentiation
potential (Figure 2).
3.3. Assessment of the Immunomodulatory Activity of hMSC-
Conditioned Medium. Conditioned medium from PBMC-
stimulated hMSCs exhibited higher activity than the PBMC-
stimulated hMSCs themselves (one-tail t-test; P = 5.52 ×
10−7
; n = 5), as measured by decreases in the number
of IFNγ-positive spots. The immunosuppressive potential of
PBMC-stimulated hMSCs and their conditioned media was
higher (one-tail t-test; P = 1.46 × 10−7
; n = 5) than that of
the conditioned media from nonstimulated hMSCs and the
non-stimulated hMSCs themselves (Figure 3). Supported by
these results and for logistical reasons and ease of use, in-
depth analysis of the immunosuppressive activity of hMSCs
from the study groups at diﬀerent passages was performed
on conditioned media samples rather than with the cells.
3.4. Stimulation of hMSCs by IL-1β. Conditioned media
generated after activation of hMSCs with either PBMCs
or IL-1β exhibited immunosuppressive activity in IFNγ
ELISpots (Figure 4). The conditioned media generated by
stimulation of hMSCs with IL-1β exhibited higher (one-tail
paired t-test; P = 5.23 × 10−7
, n = 50) and more consistent
immunosuppressive activity (CV = 33%) than media from
cultures stimulated with PBMCs (CV = 54%).
The higher variability of the conditioned media gener-
ated by stimulation of hMSC cultures with PBMCs likely
reﬂects the interindividual variability among the blood
donors from whom the PBMCs were isolated.
Consequently, for simplicity and data consistency, we
focused our analyses on conditioned media from IL-1β-
stimulated hMSCs although both PBMC and IL-1β stimu-
lation were tested for all cultures.
3.5. Eﬀect of Ex Vivo Expansion on the Immunosuppressive
Potential of hMSCs. To analyze the eﬀect of time-in-culture
on the immunosuppressive potential of each hMSC prepara-
tion, the inhibitory activity of each passage was normalized
to that of the ﬁrst passage of that preparation to minimize
variability in the intrinsic degree of inhibition among the 5
cell preparations.
Overall, when all ﬁve cell preparations were considered,
there was a decrease in the immunosuppressive activity as
a function of time in culture (single factor ANOVA; P =
.010, n = 10) (Figure 5(a)). Conditioned media from cells
at passage 1 and passage 4 had equivalent activity (one-tail
paired t-test; P = .437, n = 10) to one another and supe-
rior to the activity of conditioned media from cells at pas-
sages 7, 10, and 13 (one-tail paired t-test; P ≤ .044, n = 10);
conditioned media from cells at passage 7 had similar activity

to that of cells from passages 10 and 13 (one-tail paired t-
test; P ≥ .146, n = 10), and conditioned media from cells at
passage 10 were more immunosuppressive than those of cells
from passage 13 (one-tail paired t-test; P = .007, n = 10).
In three of the cell preparations tested, the immuno-
suppressive activity was unchanged over the passages tested
(single factor ANOVA; P = .064, n = 6) (Figure 5(b))
while in two preparations the activity exhibited a continued
decrease over time (single factor ANOVA; P = .017, n = 4)
(Figure 5(c)).
3.6. Eﬀect of FGF-2 Supplementation on the Immunosup-
pressive Potential of hMSCs. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were
observed between the immunosuppressive activity of cell
preparation- and passage-matched hMSCs grown under
control conditions or supplemented with FGF-2 (one-tail
paired t-test; P = .285; n = 25) (Figure 6(a)). However, the
comparison of passage-matched groups may not be biologi-
cally relevant. As indicated above, the number of population
doublings that FGF-treated cells have undergone at any given
passage is higher than those of their control counterparts.
When the comparison between the two diﬀerent culture
conditions was performed matching the subpopulations
within each cell preparation by the number of population
doublings rather than by the number of passages, cells

expanded in FGF-supplemented medium exhibited higher
immunosuppressive activity than their control counterparts
(one-tail paired t-test; P = .002; n = 11) (Figure 6(b)).
4. Discussion
Due to their immunosuppressive properties, MSCs are being
tested clinically to treat GVHD and other autoimmune
disorders [18, 46–49]. However, because of the low frequency
of MSCs in the bone marrow [50], the clinical application of
hMSCs to treat GVHD requires extensive ex vivo expansion
to achieve the cell doses currently utilized for patient
treatment. For example, for an 80-kg patient, one single
hMSC injection at the lowest dose (106 cells per kg of body
weight) being tested in clinical trials would necessitate 8
× 107 cells. In this dataset, that level of expansion would
have been reached by the end of the fourth passage under
control conditions or by the end of the ﬁrst passage under
FGF-supplemented conditions. If multiple injections and/or
higher doses were required, the cell number needed for the
entire course of treatment could be as high as 4 × 109 cells.
In the current experiments, this higher level of expansion
would require 7 or 8 passages in control and 4 passages in
FGF-supplemented conditions.
The data presented here conﬁrm the value of expansion
in FGF-supplemented medium [31, 51–53]. Speciﬁcally,
compared to expansion in control conditions, FGF-2 supple-
mentation would result, on average, in 3,500-fold increase
in the number of hMSCs obtained by passage 7, 24,000-
fold increase in hMSCs by passage 10, and 240,000-fold
increase in hMSCs by passage 13. These diﬀerences can
be critical in the clinical application of these cells, as FGF
supplementation can expedite production of cells resulting
in more rapid preclinical testing, characterization, and

data are presented as pairs of preparation- and passage-matched
hMSCs subsets. Note that for 8 of the 11 data pairs (73%) the
conditioned medium from FGF-treated hMSCs is more immuno-
suppressive than that of their control counterparts. Overall, the

availability of clinical-grade hMSCs, thereby signiﬁcantly
impacting the clinical application of MSC therapies.
It is well known that hMSC preparations have signiﬁcant
proliferative potential [19] but their extensive expansion
results in loss of diﬀerentiation potential, onset of senes-
cence [21], and/or apoptosis [54]. Although reports in the
literature provide ample support for the immunosuppressive
activity of hMSCs [10, 13, 14, 17, 55–57], the fate of this
activity as the cell preparations are expanded has not been
studied in depth. To date, only one report indicates that
the immunosuppressive activity of hMSCs does not appear
to decrease through 6 or 7 passages, as measured in vitro
[58].
Our studies included the standard expansion conditions
as initially described by Haynesworth and colleagues in
1992 [59] and supplementation with FGF-2 which has been
shown to have beneﬁcial eﬀects on the proliferative and
diﬀerentiation potentials of MSCs [27–29, 31, 32, 60]. We
expanded the cell preparations for 13 passages, a level of
expansion at which most hMSC preparations have reached
senescence [19]. In this expansion, control MSCs reached
26.3 ± 4.7 population doublings by passage 13, while FGF-
treated cells reached 44.2 ± 3.9. Of note, FGF-treated hMSCs
reached 28.0 ± 2.6 population doublings (the maximum
expansion obtained with control cells) around passage 6 in
approximately 5 weeks compared to the 9 weeks required
to achieve that level of expansion in control conditions, a
diﬀerence that might be crucial for the timely administration
of the cellular product.
FGF-treated hMSCs exhibited immunosuppressive activ-
ity comparable to that of passage-matched controls and
that of population doubling-matched controls. Thus, while
FGF supplementation does not elicit the signiﬁcant improve-
ments that have been reported for the chondrogenic poten-
tial of hMSCs [31], maintaining the immunosuppressive
activity is critical for the application to disease conditions
associated with aberrant T-cell alloreactivity.
On a the technical aspect and relative to assay opti-
mization, our data corroborate previous reports indicating
that, at least in part, the immunosuppressive activity of
hMSCs is mediated through soluble factors [13, 55, 61–
63] and that hMSCs likely need to be stimulated by their
microenvironment to exert this activity [14, 63, 64]. We have
shown that medium conditioned by MSCs activated with
PBMCs is immunosuppressive. This observation allows the
use of conditioned medium to characterize the activity of
the hMSCs. To this end, conditioned media from diﬀerent
preparations and passages can be prepared and stored and
then tested simultaneously against the same eﬀector cells,
allowing better comparison of the results.
Additionally, the immunosuppressive activity of condi-
tioned media from hMSC activated with PBMCs or IL-1β
was comparable, but media generated with IL-1β had higher
activity and, importantly, less variability in immunosuppres-
sive activity, supporting the use of IL-1β instead of PBMCs
for activation of the hMSCs and simplifying the preparation
of the conditioned media in order to standardize stimulation
using a recombinant cytokine rather than uncharacterized
cell preparations.
5. Conclusions
In summary, compared to control conditions, hMSC expan-
sion in FGF-supplemented medium would potentially ben-
eﬁt the intended recipients of these cellular products by
enabling the acquisition of equivalent numbers of cells in a

signiﬁcantly reduced timeframe or more cells in the same
period of time without loss of their immunosuppressive
activity.
However, the immunosuppressive activity as measured in
vitro using IFNγ ELISpot assays was not universally preserved
in all the cell preparations from individual donors. Therefore,
caution must be exercised when signiﬁcant expansion of the
MSCs is desired or required. In these cases, the activity of the
ﬁnal cell population should be veriﬁed, and perhaps activity
or potency minimums should be established as part of the
release criteria for therapeutic application. In addition, these
initial in vitro observations must be validated using in vivo
models because the microenvironment could certainly aﬀect
the activity or performance of these cells [65].
