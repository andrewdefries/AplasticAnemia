INTRODUCTION
The human immune system maintains the balance be-
tween protecting the host from pathologic microorganisms
and avoiding excess immune reactions that could be harm-
ful to the host [1]. Aberrant immune reactions can cause
serious damage to host, such as various autoimmune and
inflammatory diseases. Naturally occurring thymus-derived
CD4+
CD25+
regulatory T-cells (Tregs) play a critical role in
the control of immune responses in various clinical settings,
including autoimmune diseases, allergic disorders, infec-
tions, transplantations, and cancers [2-5].
A number of previous studies reported a high percentage
of Tregs in tumor tissues and peripheral blood (PB) from
patients with various cancers, including lung cancer, breast
cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric, and ovarian can-
cer [6-9]. They showed that a high percentage of Tregs or a
low ratio of CD8+
T-cells to Tregs was associated with poor
prognosis and more advanced stage [7, 10, 11]. In addition
to solid tumors, a few recent studies have demonstrated in-
creased Tregs in hematologic malignancies. The increase of
Tregs was stage dependent and correlated with unfavorable
cytogenetics [12-14]. However, some earlier studies were
limited in that they used less specific detection markers for
Tregs [13, 15, 16].
In spite of the many advanced diagnostic tools, differen-
tial diagnoses between clonal or neoplastic hematologic dis-
eases and non-clonal conditions are sometimes challenging.
Since most non-clonal conditions such as aplastic anemia
(AA) and primary immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)
are based on autoimmune processes, we can speculate that
the proportion of Tregs might differ between neoplastic and
autoimmune hematologic diseases. To the best of our knowl-

edge, no previous study has directly compared Tregs betw­
een neoplastic and autoimmune hematologic diseases. In
addition, most studies have shown the data for Tregs in PB,
and the data on Tregs in bone marrow (BM) have been very
sparse. BM Tregs have only been evaluated in neoplastic he­
matologic diseases.
In this study, we wanted to explore the status of Tregs and
compare the proportion of Tregs between neoplastic and
autoimmune hematologic diseases. Because we wanted to
determine suitable conditions for Treg measurement in rou-
tine diagnostic practice, we also evaluated the technical as-
pects of Treg measurement, including sample types and the
combination of detection markers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
1.Studypopulation
A total of 68 subjects were enrolled in this study from June
2009 until July 2010. There were 36 males and 32 females,
and their median age was 57 yr (range, 18-85 yr). Twenty-
nine subjects were diagnosed with various hematologic dis-
eases: 11 patients with AML, 8 with MDS, 2 with AA, 5 with
ITP, and 3 with autoimmune disease-related cytopenia such
as systemic sclerosis or Sjogren’s syndrome. The 8 patients
with MDS included 1 patient with refractory anemia with
ring sideroblasts (RARS), 2 with refractory cytopenia and
multilineage dysplasia (RCMD), and 5 with refractory ane-
mia and excess blasts (RAEB). The diagnoses were made by
2 hematologists following the WHO classification [17]. The
patients with MDS were divided into 2 groups (low-grade
and high-grade MDS) because the role of immune responses
in the pathogenesis of these 2 groups is known to be differ-
ent. Autoimmune processes have been suggested especially
in low-grade MDS [18-20]. The low-grade MDS group in-
cluded low/intermediate-1 risk, and the high-grade MDS
group included intermediate-2/high risk, based on the In-
ternational Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score. AA, ITP,
and autoimmune disease-related cytopenia were categoriz­ed
as the autoimmune group.
The control group (N=39) consisted of 11 patients with
no evidence of specific hematologic diseases on BM exami-
nations and 28 healthy subjects who received regular check-
ups. The study groups did not differ in terms of age and sex
(Table 1). This study was approved by the institutional ethics
committee and informed consent was obtained from each
enrolled subject.
2.FlowcytometryanalysisforTregs
PB and BM samples were obtained from all subjects, ex-
cept for 28 healthy subjects in the control group, from whom
only PB samples were available. The samples were collected
in sterile EDTA tubes during routine diagnostic or check-
up visits, and mononuclear cells (MNC) were separated by
density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll (Ficoll-Paque;
GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Milan, Italy). Isolated MNC
layers were resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
at the concentration of 1×106
cells/mL.
For the analysis of Tregs, a Human Regulatory T Cell Stain-

rescein isothiocyanate (FITC) CD4, phycoerythrin (PE) CD­
25, and phycoerythrin-cyanin 5 (PE-Cy5) FoxP3 (forkhead
box P3) was used. Tregs were analyzed according to the ma­
nufacturer’s instructions. Isotype-negative controls included
a mouse isotype matched non-relevant immunoglobulin to
define the positive population. After gating the lymphocyte
population, the CD4+

FoxP3+
population were sequentially gated and analyz­ed.
The percentage of FoxP3+

) was
counted in the CD4+
population (Fig. 1). Multicolor flow
cytometry analysis was performed using Cytomics FC500
and CXP software (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA).
3.Statisticalanalysis
Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was used for categor-
ical variables and Student’s t-test or Kruskal-Wallis test was
used for continuous variables, as appropriate. Pearson’s cor-
relation was used for comparisons. The statistical analysis
was performed using SPSS Software (version 14.0; SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) and MedCalc Statistical Software (ver-
sion 11.2.1; Mariakerke, Belgium). P values of ≤0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

immune cells, including CD4+
CD25-
T-cells, CD8+
T-cells,
dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and B-cells, by cell-to-cell
contact in a dose-dependent manner [1, 21, 22]. In addition
to naturally-occurring Tregs, several subsets of Tregs, inclu­
ding antigen-induced Tregs (e.g., Tr1 and Th3 cells), and
adaptively induced CD4+
Tregs in the periphery by conver-
sion of CD4+
CD25-
T-cells and CD8+
T-cells, have been re-
cently identified [6, 22].
In this study, we evaluated the proportion of CD4+
CD25+­
FoxP3+
Tregs in PB and BM samples from patients with var-
ious hematologic diseases. To the best of our knowledge, no
previous study has directly compared the PB and BM Treg
populations among clonal and autoimmune hematologic
diseases. Moreover, there has been very little data on the dis-
tribution of Tregs in normal healthy Asian populations.
According to our data, the percentage of CD4+
CD25high
FoxP3+
Tregs in the control group was 4.0±1.3% in PB and
2.3±1.2% in BM. Treg data in control individuals varied
widely across studies, ranging from 0.5% to 12% in PB; and
the percentage of Tregs in BM was consistently lower than
in PB [15, 23-26]. Such wide variation may be due to differ-
ences in detection markers, gating strategies, and parame-
ters. Although most studies analyzed the percentage of Tregs
within the CD4+
cell population using CD4, CD25, and Fox­
P3, some studies used only CD4 and CD25 or other param-
eters such as absolute counts and percentages in total lym-
phocytes [12, 24]. In almost all these studies, the number of
control subjects was very limited. Moreover, very heteroge-
neous groups of patients were used as controls, and most of
them could not be considered as true healthy, reference in-
dividuals. Therefore, both assay standardization and deter-
mination of the reference range in each ethnic population
using large numbers of healthy individuals are needed for
the routine clinical use of Tregs.
In our study, the AML and high-grade MDS groups had
significantly increased Treg populations in both PB and BM
compared with the control and autoimmune groups. Re-
cently, an increased proportion of Tregs in PB was reported
in hematologic malignancies such as AML, multiple my-
eloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma, and high-
grade MDS [22, 25]. In clonal hematologic diseases, increased
Tregs in BM was also significant, which was in agreement
with previous studies [16, 18]. Although the results for Tregs
in BM and PB were well correlated, the proportion of Tregs
was lower in BM, and the difference in BM between groups
was less significant.
Regarding autoimmune hematologic diseases such as AA
and ITP, a few recent studies reported reduced proportion
and function of Tregs in PB [24, 26, 27]. In addition, there
is evidence for an association between early-stage MDS and
autoimmune manifestations, which has not been shown for
high-grade MDS [19]. A recent study reported a lower pro-
portion of PB Tregs in early MDS [18]. In our study, the low-
grade MDS group also had a low proportion of Tregs in both
PB and BM, which was comparable to those of the autoim-
mune and control groups.
Tregs are identified by the expression of CD25, which is a
component of the high affinity interleukin 2 receptor, and is
functionally essential for Treg development. However, CD25
is known to be not specific for Tregs, since it is also expressed
by effector T-cells. To date, expression of FoxP3, a member
of the forkhead/winged-helix family of transcriptional fac-
tors, is considered an optimal marker for Tregs [1, 28]. Nev-
ertheless, our data showed that CD4+

CD4 and PB CD4+
CD25high
FoxP3+
/CD4 populations were
significantly different between the groups with neoplastic
disease and the autoimmune and control groups (Fig. 3).
Regarding sample type, the Tregs in PB differed more sig-
nificantly between groups than those in BM. Previous stud-
ies showed that increased Tregs in cancer is a generalized
phenomenon, both in the tumor microenvironment and in
PB [22]. From a technical point of view, BM processing is
more difficult due to fat tissues and lower lymphocyte pro-
portions; thus, sampling from PB would be better than sam-
pling from BM for Treg measurement in routine clinical set-
tings. However, the clinical significance of Tregs in PB and/
or BM needs to be further evaluated using large clinical data
sets.
In conclusion, this study directly compared Tregs in vari-
ous hematologic diseases, including AML, MDS, and auto-
immune hematologic diseases. In spite of the limited study
population, our data would be useful in understanding the
different immunologic bases of various hematologic diseases.
Measurement of Tregs using CD4, CD25, and/or FoxP3 in
PB rather than BM seems to be practical for routine hema-
tologic purposes. The diagnostic role of Treg measurement
needs to be further evaluated with a larger clinical data set.
