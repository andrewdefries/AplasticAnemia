S_mnary Questionnaires assessing a range of quality of life (QOL) outcomes were completed by 200 adult
bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients from five BMT treatment centres. Respondents had undergone
allogeneic (46%) or autologous BMT (54%) for a haematological malignancy and were disease free and at
least 12 months post BMT (mean 43 months). Variability in post-BMT QOL was reported with deficits in
physical, sexual and occupational functioning particularly likely. Allogeneic recipients reported poorer QOL
than autologous recipients. Greater age at BMT, lower level of education and more advanced disease at BMT
were consistent risk factors for poorer QOL. Contrary to previous research, evidence for improved functional
status with the passage of time post BMT was obtained. Factors generally not associated with post-BMT QOL
included disease diagnosis, dose of total body irradiation, presence of chronic graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD), type of GVHD prophylaxis and extent of marrow graft match. In conclusion, while many BMT
recipients reported normal QOL, the majority indicated that their QOL was compromised relative to
premorbid status. Prospective, longitudinal research will be necessary to further identify risk factors for poor
post-BMT QOL and identify the temporal trajectory of post-BMT QOL.
Keywordis: bone marrow transplantation; quality of life; adjustment; psychosocial
Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is used as curative
treatment for a variety of life-threatening, primarily malig-
nant, diseases (Champlin and Gale, 1984; Chao and Blume,
1989, 1990). While initially used as a treatment of 'last
resort', advances in transplant immunology and
immunogenetics, human leucocyte antigen (HLA) testing,
pre-BMT conditioning and supportive care have resulted in
improved clinical outcomes as well as expansion of the range
of diseases and patients for which BMT is indicated. As a
result, BMT has undergone a dramatic increase in utilisation
(Bortin and Rimm, 1989).
While physical 'late effects' of BMT have been recognised,
including pulmonary problems, cataracts, sterility, chronic
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and development of a
secondary malignancy (Deeg, 1990; Kolb and Bender-Gotze,
1990), less is known about the quality of life (QOL) of BMT
recipients. QOL is typically viewed as a multidimensional
construct, incorporating information regarding individuals'
current physical symptoms and general health perceptions as
well as information regarding physical, emotional, occupa-
tional and interpersonal functioning (Ware, 1984; Moinpour
et al., 1989). With long-term disease-free survival following
BMT increasingly likely, knowledge of post-BMT QOL has
become increasingly significant (Andrykowski, 1994).
Research examining post-BMT QOL has appeared with
increasing frequency in recent years (Andrykowski et al.,
1990; Baker et al., 1991, 1994; Wingard et al., 1991, 1994;
Belec, 1992; Chao et al., 1992; Mumma et al., 1992; Vose et
al., 1992; Schmidt et al., 1993; Syrjala et al., 1993). This
research has shown that while many adult BMT recipients
exhibit few functional and psychosocial deficits and
experience what could be considered a 'normal' QOL, other
recipients experience functional and psychosocial 'late
effects', including low self-esteem, occupational disability,
sexual dysfunction, cognitive impairment and psychological
distress. While some studies have linked poorer post-BMT
QOL to older age at BMT, increased dose of total body
irradiation (TBI) received in pre-BMT conditioning, presence
of chronic GVHD, and lower level of education, results have
not been consistent across investigations (Lesko, 1993; And-
rykowski, 1994). Other disease and treatment variables that
might be linked with post-BMT QOL outcomes, such as
diagnosis and disease status at BMT, extent of marrow graft
match, or even type of BMT, have been largely unexamined
in previous research. If one assumes that patients with more
advanced disease have undergone more extensive cytotoxic
treatment before BMT and allogeneic recipients of more
'mismatched' grafts (e.g. haploidentical grafts) are more
likely to receive more extensive pre-BMT conditioning
regimens and/or GVHD prophylaxis, then one might
hypothesise that poorer QOL outcomes would be associated
with more advanced disease at BMT, poorer marrow graft
match and allogeneic BMT.
Three basic questions are addressed in the present study:
I What is the QOL of adult BMT recipients?
2 How does the QOL of autologous recipients compare with
that of allogeneic recipients?
3 What demographic, disease and treatment variables are
associated with variance in post-BMT QOL?
With regard to the last two questions, it is hypothesised
that better post-BMT QOL will be associated with less
education, younger recipients, the absence of chronic GVHD,
autologous BMT, less advanced disease at BMT, less TBI
during pre-BMT conditioning and histocompatible marrow
grafts.
Materials nd methods
Participants were adults who had received BMT for a malig-
nant disease at one of five BMT centres: the University of
Kentucky, Vanderbilt University, Brigham & Women's Hos-
pital, the University of Iowa and the University of Nebraska.

Eligibility criteria included: (1) > 18 years of age; (2) > 12
months post allogeneic or autologous BMT; (3) in disease
remission; and (4) English-speaking. Eligible patients were
sent a letter describing the study and two copies of a consent
form. Following return of a signed consent, the name, add-
ress and telephone number of the BMT recipient were for-
warded to project headquarters at the University of Ken-
tucky. Participants were then mailed a packet of question-
naires to complete and return by mail. Upon receipt of a
completed questionnaire packet information was abstracted
from medical records, including age, diagnosis and disease
status at time of BMT, time since BMT, type of BMT and
pre-BMT conditioning regimen, pre-BMT cytotoxic treat-
ment and site and severity of acute and chronic GVHD.
Patients
A total of 284 patients were invited to participate in the
present study. Consent for participation was obtained from

242, with 209 returning packets of questionnaires. Twenty-
two of 33 patients who provided consent but did not return
questionnaire packets were later found not to meet eligibility
criteria either because they had a non-malignant disease or
because their disease was not in remission. Therefore, of the
262 eligible patients invited to participate, 220 (84%) pro-
vided consent and 209 (80%) returned questionnaire packets.
To reduce sample heterogeneity, respondents who received
BMT for a solid tumour (n = 6) or myelodysplastic disease
(n = 3) were excluded from analysis.
The final study sample of 200 respondents consisted of
both allogeneic (n = 93; 46%) and autologous BMT
recipients (n = 107; 54%). At the time of the study, res-
pondents were a mean of 38.5 years of age (s.d. = 10.7; range
19-70 years) and a mean of 41 months post BMT
(s.d. = 28.3; range 12-127 months). Mean time between
initial cancer diagnosis and BMT was 30.2 months
(s.d. = 36.8). Additional demographic, disease and treatment
information is shown in Table I.

A variety of pre-BMT conditioning regimens were
represented in the present sample. Total body irradiation
(TBI) was administered to 108 patients (54%). Total dose of
TBI received during pre-BMT conditioning ranged from 550
to 1420 cGy (mean = 1158 cGy; s.d. = 228 cGy). Forty-eight
allogeneic BMT recipients (52%) had a history of acute
GVHD. Sites of involvement for acute GVHD were scin
(n = 39), gut (n = 4) and liver (n = 5). The number of patients
with various gades of acute GVHD was: skin (grade I = 18;
grade II = 16, grade III = 5), gut (grade I = 2; grade 1= 1;
grade II = 1; grade IV= 1) and liver (grade I =4; grade
1= 1). Thirty-eight allogeneic recipients (41%) had a history
of chronic GVHD. Of these, the chronic GVHD of only two
patients was graded as 'extensive', while the chronic GVHD
of the remaining 36 patients was graded as 'limited'. Sites of
chronic GVHD were skin (n = 29), gut (n = 13) and liver
(n= 17).
Questionnaire measures
Participants completed several standardised instruments in-
cluding the: (1) Profile of Mood States (POMS) (McNair et
al., 1981), a measure of recent affective state; (2) sexual
relationships subscale from the Psychological Adjustment to
Illness Scale (PAIS) (Derogatis, 1986); and (3) Work, alert-
ness behaviour, home management, recreation and pastimes,
and social interaction subscales from the Sickness Impact
Profile (SIP) (Bergner et al., 1981), a measure of illness-
related dysfunction. Several instruments designed specifically
for assessing post-BMT QOL were also used. The Recovery
of Function (ROF) scale consisted of a list of eight post-
BMT outcome domains (see Table II). Domains were chosen
based upon previous studies of post-BMT QOL as well as
discussion with BMT medical staff. Using their own self-
defined standard, respondents were asked to indicate whether
their present status in each of these domains was 'not nor-
mal', 'almost normal', or 'normal'. The Perceived Health
Questionnaire (PHQ) used a ten-step health ladder (Cantril,
l%5) to obtain respondents' ratings of (1) their current
physical health, (2) the health of a typical person their age,
and (3) their health before their illns. The Perceived Quality
of Life Questionnaire (PQOL) obtained these same three
ratings with respect to QOL. The Symptom Experience
Report (SER) asd the presence during the past week of
20 physical symptoms. If present, symptom severity was
rated using a seven-point Likert scale. The PHQ, PQOL and
SER have been used in our prior QOL research with BMT
candidates (Andrykowski et al., 1993) and recipients (Andry-
kowski et al., 1990).
Data preparation and analysis
Several indices were computed using standard procedures: (1)
SIP, scores for each of the five subscales used, (2) PAIS;
subscale score for sexual relationships (PAIS-sex) and (3)
POMS; total mood disturbane score (POMS-TMD) and
subscale scores for depression (D), anger (A), tension (T),
vigour (V), fatigue (F) and confusion (C). POMS-TMD
scores were computed using the formula D + A + T+ F +
C+(32-V) (Andrykowski et al., 1990).
Two other indices were computed. Scores for the five SIP
subscales were summed and divided by 5 to create a total
illness-related dysfunction score (SIP-total). Item scores on
the ROF were used to compute an index of total functional
recovery (ROF-total). A response of 'not normal' was
assigned a value of 3, 'almost normal' a value of 2 and
'normal' a value of 1. ROF-total scores ranged from 8 to 24.
Coefficient alpha, a measure of internal consistency, was 0.89
for the eight-item ROF-total scale. ROF-total scores have
demonstrated high concordance with reports of recovery of
normal functioning obtained during interviews with BMT
recipients (Andrykowski et al., 1995). Several dichotomous
disease and treatment variables were created. Marital status
was dichotomised as either married or unmarried. Patients
were dichotomised on the basis of disease status at BMT:
first remission, first relapse or first chronic phase chronic
myeloidukleaemia (CML) vs all others. For allogeneic
recipients, chronic GVHD was categorised as either present
or absent and quality of graft match was categorised as
either fully (i.e. histocompatible) or partially matched (i.e.
haploidentical or matched unrelated donor).
Statistical analyses were conducted using the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences - X (SPSS-X). Unless other-
wise indicated, results were considered statistically significant
if the probability of their occurrence was 0.05 or less. All
2 x 2 chi-square analyses employed Yates' correction.
Resits
Current QOL and comparison ofautologous and allogeneic
recipients
Recovery of normal functionig Percentages of BMT
recipients reporting current functioning as 'not normal' or
'normal' for each ROF domain are shown in Table II. The
ability to engage in 'vigorous physical activity' and 'sexual
activity' were most likely to be compromised, with 24% and
37% of recipients, respectively, reporting 'normal' current
status. 'Soialsing with friends' and 'personal appearance'
were least likely to be compromised with 62% and 56% of
recipients, respectively, reporting 'normal' status. Only 22
respondents (11%) reported normal status in all eight ROF
domains.
Multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to
compare allogeneic and autologous recipients with regard to
responses to the eight ROF items. A significant multivariate
effect was obtained (Wilk's lambda = 0.866; F = 3.54;
P = 0.001). Inspection of the ROF item means (Table II)
indicated that, for each ROF item, autologous recipients
reported better status than allogeneic recipients. Univariate
ANOVA for each ROF item revealed significant differences
between autologous and allogeneic recipients for 'workling
outside the home' (F= 4.41, P<0.05) and 'personal
appearance' (F= 16.86, P<0.001). An identical multivariate
effect for type of BMT was obtained when age at BMT,

gender, education and time since BMT were used as
covariates (Wilk's lambda = 0.848; F= 4.02; P<0.001).
Inspction of the covanate-adjusted item means again
indicated the superior status of autologous recipients.
Employment status Most respondents (n = 119, 60%) were
either employed or attending school. The rest of the sample
(n = 81) were neither employed nor attending school. Of
these, 65 (33% of sample) reported that medical difficulties
had resulted in their unemployment (n = 51) or had forced
them into early retirement (n = 14). Allogeneic recipients
were more likely than autologous recipients to cite medical
reasons for being unemployed or retired (41% vs 26%;
= 4.22; P<0.05).
Only a minority of the 119 individuals who were either
working or attending school reported any limitations at work
or school: 68% reported a score of zero (no dysfunction) on
the work subscale of the SIP. Among the 38 individuals
reporting some illnss-related dysfunction on the work sub-
scale of the SIP, the mean subscale score was 17.9 (range
6.6-38.3). In this group, work subscale items most frequently
endorsed included working shorter hours (30%), doing part
of their work at home (28%) and not accomplishing as much
at work (23%).
Perceived health and QOL Paired t-test analysis of PHQ
responses indicated that BMT recipients perceived their cur-
rent physical health (mean = 7.3, s.d. = 1.8) to be poorer
than the health of a typical person their age (mean = 8.4,
s.d. = 1.2) [paired t (199) = 8.22, P<O.001 as well as their
own health before their diagnosis (mean = 8.9, s.d. = 1.3)
[paired t (199)= 11.18, P<0.00IJ. An identical pattern of
results was obtained for PQOL responses. Current QOL
(mean = 7.5, s.d. = 2.0) was poorer than the QOL of a
typical age-identical person (mean = 8.2, s.d. = 1.3) [paired t
(198)=4.35; P<0.0011 as well as their own prediagnosis
QOL (mean = 8.4, s.d. = 1.6) [paired t (198) = 5.07;
P<0.001J.
Physical symptoms Physial symptom prevalenc and
severity ratings from the SER are displayed in Table HI. The
most frequently reported symptoms included 'feeling tired'
(78%), 'sleep probklms' (51 %), 'stiffjoints' (48%), 'headache'
(44%) and 'weakness' (42%). Allogeneic recipients were more
likely than autologous recipients to report nausea (Xj = 4.72,
P<0.05), skin itching (x2 = 6.28, P<0.05), mouth sores
(X2= 3.97, P<0.05) and blurred vision (Z = 12.89,
P<0.001). While significant differences were obtained for
only 4 of 20 symptoms, the overall pattern of responses
suggested a greater symptom frequency among allogeneic
recipients. Symptom prevalence for allogeneic recipients
equalled or exceeded that of autologous recipients for 17 of
the 20 physical symptoms (P=0.002, two-tailed binomial
test; Siegel, 1956). In contrast, comparison of symptom
severity ratings of autologous and allogeneic recipients using
t-test analyses showed no significant differences.
Demographic, disease and treatment vwariables associated with
post-BMT QOL
MANOVA was used to examine differences in post-BMT
QOL across diagnostic groups. Respondents were divided
into four groups: CML, acute leukaemias, Hodgkin's disease
and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Dependent variables
included total scores on the SIP, ROF and POMS, sexual
relationship subscale scores on the PAIS and current global
health and QOL ratings. No multivariate difference across
diagnostic groups was obtained (Wilk's lambda = 0.892;
F= 1.01; NS). Repetition of the MANOVA analysis using
age at BMT, gender, education and time since BMT as
covariates also failed to indicate a multivariate effect for
diagnostic group (Wilk's lambda = 0.862, F= 1.39, NS).
MANOVA was also used to examine the relationship
between GVHD prophylaxis and QOL. GVHD prophylaxis
varied across allogeneic recipients, with 95% receiving some
form of prophylactic treatment. Allogeneic recipients receiv-
ing GVHD prophylaxis were divided into three treatment
groups: steroids and/or chemotherapy (n = 12), t-cell deple-
tion (n = 55) and t-cell depletion combined with steroids
and/or chemotherapy (n = 21). Dependent variables included
total scores on the SIP, ROF and POMS, sexual rlationship
subscale scores on the PAIS and current global health and
QOL ratings. No multivanate difference across diagnostic
groups was obtained (Wilk's lambda = 0.798, F= 1.59, NS).
Repetition of the MANOVA analysis using age at BMT,
gender, education and time since BMT as covariates also
failed to indicate a multivariate effect for diagnostic group
(Wilk's lambda = 0.790, F= 1.58, NS).
Multiple regression was used to examine the association
between disease, demographic and treatment variables and
QOL. Only a subset of the QOL indices used in previous
analyses were used as dependent variables. Specific indices
were selked on the basis of common areas of deficit sug-
gested by previous analyses and to represent a range of QOL
domains. Indices examined included POMS-TMD, ROF-
totaL SIP-total and PAIS-sex scores. The mean intercorrela-
tion among these measures was 0.62 (range 0.54-0.80). Eight
predictor variables were used in the analyses: gender, age at
BMT, time since BMT, dose of TBI in pre-BMT condition-
ing, education, disease status at BMT, marital status, and

type of BMT. Results are shown in Table IV. The set of
predictors accounted for a significant proportion of the
variance in SIP-total (15.9%), PAIS-sex (20.9%) and ROF-
total scores (16.4%) (all P-values . 0.001). Education was a
significant predictor of all QOL indices with less educated
patients exhibiting poorer status. Time since BMT and age at
BMT were significant predictors of three of four QOL
indices, the exception being POMS-TMD scores. Increased
time since BMT and younger age at BMT were associated
with better QOL status.
A parallel set of analyses was conducted for allogeneic
recipients only (n = 93). A set of nine predictor variables was
used, including gender, age at BMT, time since BMT, dose of
TBI used in pre-BMT conditioning, education, disease status,
marital status, presence of chronic GVHD and extent of
marrow graft match. Results are displayed in Table V. The
set of predictors accounted for a significant proportion of
variance in SIP-total (27.2%), PAIS-sex (41.8%) and ROF-
total scores (26.4%) (all P-values <0.01). Lower level of
education was associated with poorer QOL for all four QOL
indices. More advanced disease and shorter time since BMT
were associated with poorer status for three of four QOL
indices, the exception in both cases being POMS-TMD
scores. Older age at BMT was significantly associated with
poorer ROF-total and PAIS-sex scores.
Chronic GVHD and QOL outcomes The multivariate
analyses indicated that chronic GVHD was associated only
with poorer PAIS-sex scores. To explore this further, item
scores on this subscale were contrasted using t-test analyses
for individuals with or without chronic GVHD. A significant
difference was obtained for only one of seven items: individ-
uals with chronic GVHD reported more concern regarding
Table IV Beta weights for multiple regression
sam
decreases in attractiveness [t (91) = 2.41, P<0.051. No
differences were obtained for items assessing other aspects of
sexual desire or activity. Chi-square comparison of those
with and without chronic GVHD with regard to ROF
reports of whether personal appearance and sexual activity
were 'normal' mirrored these results: individuals with chronic
GVHD were more likely to report their appearance was 'not
normal' relative to those without [28% vs 4%, X2 (2) = 11.13,
P<0.01]. No differences in regard to whether the ability to
engage in sexual activity had returned to normal were
found.
The present study confirms findings from previous research,
reports new findings and suggest avenues for future research.
Consistent with previous studies, some BMT recipients
reported excellent QOL. However, most recipients reported
their physical health and QOL to be compromised to a
degree. For example, BMT recipients perceived their current
health and QOL to be poorer than that of a typical person
their age as well as poorer than their own prediagnosis health
and QOL. These deficits cannot be attributed solely to BMT,
however, since the initial diagnosis and treatment of the
original underlying malignant disease can have a significant
negative impact in itself (Syrjala et al., 1993). Regardless of
the cause of post-BMT QOL deficits, it is significant that,
even when BMT has been 'curative', most BMT recipients do
not view themselves as having recovered their premorbid
health and QOL.

were consistent 'risk factors' for poorer QOL. The lin
between education and QOL might reflect better access to
financial, medical or psychological resources which can
facilitate post-BMT adjustment (HobfalL 1989). The link
between age and QOL could reflect age-related differences
evident in the general population. However, patients rated
their physical health and QOL to be poorer than that of a
typical person their age, suggesting that this explanation is
inadequate. More likely, older recipients are less able to
tolerate the physical rigours imposed by conventional
cytotoxic therapy and/or BMT, thus compromising recovery
of physical and functional status.
Finally, our data support previous research suggesting that
chronic GVHD is not associated with post-BMT QOL (And-
rykowski et al., 1990). Because of the wide use of GVHD
prophylaxis, GVHD was generally mikL, thus limiting its
potential impact on QOL. Chronic GVHD was associated
only with poorer sexual relationship functioning in allogeneic
recipients and was primarily due to the greater concern regar-
ding personal appearance among those with chronic
GVHD.
New findings from the present study include observations
that post-BMT QOL is associated to some degree with
disease status at BMT, type of BMT and time since BMT.
Poorer QOL was associated with more advanced disease at
BMT. This was particularly apparent for indices of func-
tional status (SIP-total, ROF-total) and for allogeneic
recipients. Since this variable has not been examined in
previous studies of post-BMT QOL, replication is warranted.
However, this finding suggests that physical and functional
recovery may be inversely associated with extent of pre-BMT
cytotoxic treatment. Relative to autologous recipients,
allogeneic recipients reported poorer QOL. Allogeneic
recipients reported: (a) less 'normal' functioning on the ROF,
(b) more physical symptoms, (c) poorer sexual relationship
functioning and (d) more unemployment. While reasons for
the poorer QOL of allogeneic recipients cannot be unam-
bigously determined in the absence of a population-based
(i.e. single disease) prospective study, our findings are helpful
from both clinical and policy perspectives. To the degree that
our sample is representative of the allogeneic and autologous
BMT experience, our data suggest that, in general,
autologous BMT is associated with fewer post-BMT QOL
deficits. This information could be helpful in the process of
obtaining informed consent as well as planning for delivery
of clinical rehabilitation services. Finally, a consistent,
positive relationship between time post BMT and QOL
indices of functional status was obtained. In contrast to
previous research (Wolcott et al., 1986; Andrykowski et al.,
1989; Belec, 1992) our data suggest that functional status
might improve across time following the first year post BMT.
Prospective, longitudinal research will be necessary to estab-
lish more firmly the temporary trajectory of QOL outcomes.
Establishment of the type and timing of specific QOL deficits
is critical to the timing of rehabilitation efforts to promote
post-BMT QOL.
In addition to identifying variables associated with post-
BMT QOL, our study identified variables which were con-
sistently not associated with post-BMT QOL. These included
differences in underlying diagnosis, dose of TBI and, for
allogeneic recipients, extent of marrow graft match and type
of GVHD prophylaxis. Analyses of the relationships between
QOL and disease diagnosis, extent of marrow graft match
and GVHD prophylaxis are unique to this study and thus
merit replication. However, our finding of a lack of associa-
tion between TBI dose and QOL contrasts with previous
research (Andrykowski et al., 1990). This difference could be
due to study differences in case mix, indices used to assess
QOL or other variables included in the regression model.
Owing to the larger scope and use of a more comprehensive
regrssion model in the present study, one is tempted to
conclude that TBI might have less impact upon QOL than
previously suggested.
Our data suggest several specific domains where post-BMT
QOL is particularly likely to be compromised. These include

fatigue, occupational disability, sleep difficulties and sexual
relationships and functioning. Consistent with previous inves-
tigations (Andrykowski, 1990; Belec, 1992; Mumma et al.,
1992), difficulties with regard to reduced weakness, fatigue
and the ability to engage in vigorous activities were pro-
nounced. Clearly, more detailed study of fatigue in adult
BMT recipients is warranted. Also consistent with previous
research (Andrykowski et al., 1990; Wingard et al., 1991;
Syrjala et al., 1993), evidence for employment difficulties
among BMT recipients was found. A third of our sample
were unemployed or-retired at the time of participation and
cited health difficulties as the cause of such. While loss of
strength and stamina contributed to unemployment in some
instances, other potential causes include discrimination
directed at cancer survivors (Hoffman, 1991), concerns over
infection, hesitancy regarding relinquishment of the 'sick role'
(Mechanic and Volkart, 1961), or simply that the benefits of
being unemployed exceed those of being employed. Unem-
ployment among BMT survivors is a concern because of
both the financial burdens borne by many BMT patients and
their families as well as the link between unemployment and
pyschosocial distress (Dew et al., 1991). Sleep dffulties also
emerged as a common complaint. 'Sleep problems' was the
second most frequently reported symptom on the SER. Since
research has not identified sleep dfficulties as a significant
problem, further investigation of the aetiology and impact of
sleep difficulties in BMT recipients is warranted, particularly
in view of its potential contribution to fatigue in BMT
patients.
Finally, reports of difficulties with sexual relationships and
functioning were common, confirming previous investigations
(Baruch et al., 1991; Chao et al., 1992; Mumma et al., 1992;
Vose et al., 1992; Wingard et al., 1994). Comparison of
PAIS-sex scores in our sample with cancer patient norms
(Derogatis and Lopez, 1983) indicated that 22 BMT
recipients (12%) scored at least one standard deviation above
the normative mean. Thus, about 12% of BMT recipients
can be considered to be experiencing senous sexual relation-
ship dysfunction relative to other cancer patients. Given that
sexual dysfunction is more common in cancer patients
relative to the general population (Andersen, 1985), the
number of BMT patients experiencng seious sexual relation-
ship dysfucntion probably exceeds 12%. Such dysfunction is
probably multifactorial in origin. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is
known to affect gonadal function in both sexes (Sherins and
Mulvihill, 1989) and can have a marked impact upon sexual
response in females (Lesko, 1993). Ovarian failure is a com-
mon sequela of cytotoxic chemotherapy, resulting in symp-
toms of vaginal dryness, dysparaeunia, decreased libido and
vaginal epithelium atrophy (Sanders et al., 1988, 1989; Cust
et al., 1989; Schubert et al., 1990). While risk for post-
chemotherapy ovarian failure increases with age, even
younger women may exhibit transient symptoms of ovarian
dysfunction for 2-6 years post BMT (Sanders et al., 1988).
Clearly, sexual difficulties are common in BMT recipients
and require monitoring, particularly in women. Further study
of the aetiology of post-BMT sexual dysfunction as well as
development and implementation of clinical interventions,
such as hormone replacement therapy, is warranted (Ostroff
and Lesko, 1991; Lesko, 1993).
Strengths and limitations ofthe present study
This is the largest and most comprehensive study of post-
BMT QOL to date. All other large-scale studies of post-BMT
QOL have been single-institution studies with findings neces-
sarily cirumscribed by the patients, diagnoses and treatment
protocols represented in the case mix at that institution. The
unique, multicentre collaboration involved in this study
greatly increased the generalisability of our findings. In addi-
tion, this collaboration allowed us to accumulate a sample of
sufficient size and heterogeneity to allow study of relation-
ships between QOL and heretofore unexamined variables
such as dignosis and disease status at BMT, type of GVHD
prophylaxis or type of BMT.

On the other hand, several weaknesses exist in the present
study. First, a prospective, longitudinal design would have
been preferable to the cross-sectional design we employed.
Few institutions, however, have the patient census necessary
to complete such an effort within a reasonable time frame.
Collaborative efforts, like the present study or, even better,
inclusion of QOL assessments in cooperative clinical trials
(Nayfield et al., 1992) will be necessary to advance the field.
Second, the instruments that we utilised to assess QOL have
not been validated for use with BMT recipients. However,
most have been validated for use with cancer patients and, in
part, this is why we limited our study sample to BMT
recipients with malignant disease. Third, owing to the
number of data available, multiple tests of significance were
required, thus increasing the likelihood of type I error. While
significant findings should always be viewed with caution
under such circumstances, we believe the fact that many of
our analyses were driven by a priori hypotheses and/or
confirmed previous findings increases confidence in our
results. Finally, while statistically significant results emerged
for many analyses, the clinical significance of our findings is
unclear. Given the subjective nature of QOL (Aaronson,
1989), it is difficult to identify when statistical differences
between groups are clinically important. For example,
difficulties with fatigue, sexual functioning or employment
will vary in clinical significance as a function of individuals'
identities, circumstances and goals. Our data indicate com-
mon post-BMT problem areas and their associated risk fac-
tors. This can serve to focus clinical attention with interven-
tion efforts mobilised if deemed clinically appropriate.
Conclusion
Maximisation of post-BMT QOL requires rehabilitation ser-
vices targeted for specific areas of difficulty in specific
recipients at specific times during post-BMT recovery. Past
research has done well in identifying areas where QOL might
be compromised following BMT, but more in-depth studies
of specific areas of difficulty, for example sexual functioning,
underemployment, fatigue or sleep disturbance, would be
useful. In contrast, less progress has been made in identifying
specific BMT patients at risk for post-BMT difficulties, and
still less progress has been made regarding identification of
critical periods following BMT when particular difficulties
might be manifest. Our data suggest that only a minority of
variation in post-BMT QOL can be accounted for by demo-
graphic, disease and treatment variables. Understanding of
variation in post-BMT QOL will require consideration of
variables such as social support, coping style, psychiatric
history or pre-BMT expectations, and longitudinal research
will be needed to map the temporal trajectory of post-BMT
QOL and suggest critical periods when QOL might be com-
promised.
