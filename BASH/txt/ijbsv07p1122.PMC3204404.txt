Abstract
The turn of the 21st century had witnessed a surge of interest in the centrosome and its causal
relation to human cancer development - a postulate that has existed for almost a century.
Centrosome amplification (CA) is frequently detected in a growing list of human cancers, both
solid and haematological, and is a candidate "hallmark" of cancer cells. Several lines of evidence
support the progressive involvement of CA in the transition from early to advanced stages of
carcinogenesis, being also found in pre-neoplastic lesions and even in histopathological-
ly-normal tissue. CA constitutes the major mechanism leading to chromosomal instability and
aneuploidy, via the formation of multipolar spindles and chromosomal missegregation. Clin-
ically, CA may translate to a greater risk for initiation of malignant transformation, tumour
progression, chemoresistance and ultimately, poor patient prognosis. As mechanisms un-
derlying CA are progressively being unravelled, the centrosome has emerged as a novel
candidate target for cancer treatment. This Review summarizes mainly the clinical studies
performed to date focusing on the mechanisms underlying CA in human neoplasia, and
highlights the potential utility of centrosomes in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of
human cancers.
Key words: Boveri hypothesis; chromosomal instability; aneuploidy; centrosome; aurora kinase;

Introduction
Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer cells,
and may be broadly classified based on origin into
chromosomal instability (CIN) and the less common
microsatellite instability (MIN). CIN, describing the
accelerated rate of change in chromosome number,
gives rise to states of aneuploidy [1]. The mechanisms
underlying CIN remain largely unknown, but may
include defects in chromosome cohesion, mitotic
checkpoint function, centrosome copy number, ki-
netochore-microtubule attachment dynamics, and
cell-cycle regulation [2]. A causal association between
centrosome amplification (CA) and human cancer
development has long been hypothesized [3], yet ev-
idence for this proposal has not been firmly estab-
lished. CA is detected in a broad range of tumours,
both solid and haematological, and is implicated as
the major mechanism underlying the generation of
multipolar mitoses, CIN, and aneuploidy. Several
oncogenic and tumour suppressor proteins are known
to localize to the centrosomes, deregulation of which
may evoke centrosome abnormalities [4]. Emerging
data are demonstrating the detection of centrosome
defects in several pre-neoplasia, as well as the corre-
lation of more extensive centrosome alterations in the
continuum of advancing disease. Intuitively, this
supports a non-bystander role in both tumourigenesis
and disease progression. Moreover, the frequent as-
sociation with extensive karyotypic aberrations and
poor patient outcome supports its clinical significance
in human cancer [Tables 1-3].

The centrosome constitutes the major microtu-
bule organizing centre of the cell (MTOC) in mamma-
lian cells, and plays a dominant role in the mainte-
nance of cell polarity and cytoplasmic architecture
through the nucleation and spatial organization of
microtubules [5], as well as in coordinating efficient
cell cycle progression [6]. Structurally, the centrosome
is a tiny cytoplasmic organelle consisting of a core
formed by a pair of orthogonally-arranged centrioles,
embedded in a structurally complex amorphous pro-
tein matrix termed the pericentriolar material (PCM).
Centrioles are small barrel-shaped organelles con-
sisting of a cylindrical array of nine triplet microtu-
bules, whilst the PCM is composed of a lattice of
coiled-coil proteins including gamma-tubulin ring
complexes, pericentrin [7], and calcium-sensitive fi-
bres such as Sfi1p and centrin [8]. During a normal
cell cycle, centrosome duplication occurs strictly once
to yield two centrosomes that function as the spindle
poles of the dividing cell [9]. The centrosome dupli-
cation cycle is exactly coordinated with cell cycle
progression, and is tightly coupled to DNA replica-
tion, mitosis, and cytokinesis through parallel path-
ways of regulation. The presence of only two centro-
somes in the cell as it enters mitosis favours the for-
mation of a bipolar spindle and the equipartition of
chromosomes to each daughter cell.
Centrosome defects observed in human cancers
may be classified into 2 broad categories based on
structural or functional alterations. Structural defects
include changes in centrosome shape (string-like
elongated linear arrays, ring-like, amorphous, atypi-
cal filaments, corkscrew), size (usually large patchy
aggregates, but may range from tiny flecks), number
(more than 2 per cell), position (diffuse patchy cyto-
plasmic staining, scattered, clustered) and/or compo-
sition (higher protein levels, inappropriate phosphor-
ylation, absent centrioles). Functionally, defective
centrosomes are capable of abnormal microtubule
nucleation, and formation of disorganized mitotic
spindles, leading to chromosomal missegregation and
aneuploidy [10-12]. These defects, collective referred
to as CA, are major contributors to mechanisms un-
derlying loss of cell cycle fidelity, genomic instability
and loss of tissue architecture in human cancers.
CA can arise via several fundamentally distinct
but yet not mutually exclusive mechanisms. Firstly,
deregulation of the centrosome duplication cycle may
occur, leading to centriole overduplication (loss of
cell-cycle control) or excessive centriole multiplication
(loss of copy number control) during a single S-phase.
The former involves successive rounds of centriole
reproduction, whilst the latter entails the rapid sim-
ultaneous formation of multiple daughter centrioles at
single maternal centriole templates. Both would result
in the formation of supernumerary centrosomes in
near-diploid cells [13]. Secondly, failure of cytokinesis
may generate polyploid cells with supernumerary
centrosomes [14]. In such cells, centrosome number
accumulates in parallel with nuclear abnormalities
and do not primarily originate from enhanced dupli-
cation. The potential for such cells to re-enter S-phase
and give rise to viable progeny seems to depend at
least partially on the fidelity of the tetraploidy
checkpoint governed by p53 function, which in such
cells triggers cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Thirdly,
centrosome number can increase via cell fusion, for
example, when cells are under the influence of fuso-
genic viruses [15, 16]. Fourthly, functional centrioles
may also form de novo [17, 18]. Lastly, the disintegra-
tion of centrosomes via fragmentation of PCM may
lead to an appearance of CA which otherwise may not
necessarily be functional [19, 20]. The exact mecha-
nisms triggering CA and the relative importance of
each of their contribution towards the development of
specific human cancers remain under intensive re-
search. The issue gets further complicated since the
presence of extra centrosomes does not necessarily
lead to major cell division errors as extra centrosomes
have been demonstrated to undergo clustering [21], or
even gradual inactivation [22] during mitosis, thereby
preserving bipolarity of the mitotic spindle. At the
same time, a limited level of CIN that permits con-
tinued bipolar cell division may be maintained con-
sequent to segregation errors via merotelic kineto-
chore-microtubule attachment possibly during a
transient „multipolar spindle intermediate‟ prior to
centrosome clustering and anaphase [23]. Still, cells
with amplified centrosomes are often too unstable to
survive, and are eliminated through cell death
mechanisms such as apoptosis, mitotic catastrophe, or
replicative senescence [23, 24]. It is likely in order for
tumourigenesis to occur, these selection forces ulti-
mately must result in the generation of a rare centro-
some-amplified, genomically-unstable but yet viable
cellular subclone. In possession of a sustainable mu-
tator phenotype, cells that eventually harbour the rare
genomic complement that confer survival advantage
through a Darwinian selection process would pro-
mote cancer development and progression [Figure 1].

Figure 1. Model supporting centrosome amplification as a cause of carcinogenesis. Centrosome amplification
has been detected in broad range of tumours, both solid and haematological, and has been implicated in the generation of
multipolar mitoses, chromosomal instability (CIN), and aneuploidy. Centrosome amplification also contributes to loss of
tissue architecture, and possibly angiogenesis in human cancers. Defective centrosomes are capable of abnormal micro-
tubule nucleation and formation of disorganized mitotic spindles, leading to chromosomal missegregation and aneuploidy.
However, the presence of extra centrosomes does not necessarily lead to major cell division errors as extra centrosomes
may undergo clustering, thereby preserving bipolarity of the mitotic spindle. Ultimately, the "mutator phenotype" generated
as a result raises the possibility of producing cells with the rare genomic complement that may confer survival advantage
through a Darwinian selection process, thereby promoting cancer development and progression.
Despite the vastly expanding amount of studies
demonstrating the clinical relevance of CA in human
cancers, there is as yet no comprehensive review of
the existing literature. This Review will summarize
studies performed to date implicating CA on human
neoplasia, with a focus on those based on human
cancer tissue samples. Relevant in vitro studies that
shed light on the underlying mechanisms leading to
CA in specific tumour types are also included. Finally,
the potential utility of centrosomes in the diagnosis,
prognosis and treatment of human cancers are dis-
cussed.
Centrosome amplification in solid tumours
Breast cancer
In primary human cancers, structural alterations
of centrosomes have been first systematically studied
in specimens of high grade metastatic breast adeno-
carcinoma. Several centrosome defects, including an
increase in centrosome number and volume, with
chaotic subcellular locations, accumulation of exces-
sive PCM, supernumerary centrioles, as well as inap-
propriate accumulation of phosphocentrin during
non-mitotic phases are frequently observed. In addi-
tion, breast tumour cells display functional centro-
some abnormalities, as characterized by unusually
large arrays of microtubules nucleated by an in-
creased number of MTOCs [25]. Ultrastructural anal-
ysis of centrosomes via electron microscopy revealed
that breast tumour cells contain numerous large cen-
trioles surrounded by abundant densely-stained
PCM, disrupted centriole barrel structure (open-ring
and missing triplet microtubules), unincorporated
microtubule complexes, centrioles of unusual length,
centrioles functioning as ciliary basal bodies, and

mispositioned centrioles [25, 26]. Interestingly, tu-
mours with excess PCM are highly anaplastic, lack
normal cell polarity, and tend to have a higher median
frequency of abnormal mitoses compared to tumours
with other centrosome abnormalities [26].
Supporting CA as a causal and early event in
breast tumourigenesis, CA is also present in ductal
carcinoma in-situ (DCIS), and correlates with CIN in
these lesions [27-29]. Gamma-tubulin gene amplifica-
tion and the concomitant protein overexpression are
also seen in atypical ductal hyperplasia of the breast,
albeit significantly lower than in lesions of DCIS and
invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) [30, 31]. Moreover,
within DCIS lesions, centrosome defects increases
with advanced histological grade, which suggests a
higher propensity of evolution into invasive carcino-
ma [28].
Kronenwett et al. classified aneuploid human
breast cancers into genomically-stable and -unstable
subtypes using a surrogate marker based upon the
proportion of cells with non-modal DNA content
values referred to as the Stemline Scatter Index (SSI)
[32]. In keeping with earlier studies [27], greater CA,
along with aberrant mitotic spindles are observed in
genomically-unstable and clinically more aggressive
aneuploid breast cancers with high SSI, compared to
genomically-stable aneuploid and diploid counter-
parts [29, 32]. Furthermore, CA correlates with high
histological grade and lymph node metastasis in most
studies, supporting it as a possible marker for aggres-
sive disease and poor prognosis in breast cancer [27,
32-35]. The implication of CA upon breast cancer
prognosis is further supported by its association with
HER2/neu overexpression, negative estrogen recep-
tor (ER) status, and negative progesterone receptor
(PR) status in some studies [34-36]. One study how-
ever, did not find any association of CA with CIN, nor
with hormonal receptor status, HER2/neu status,
tumour size, grade or nodal status [37].
Numerous studies have been performed at-
tempting to uncover the underlying mechanisms and
significance of CA in breast cancer development.
Available evidence suggests a cooperative model of
different mechanisms for the development of CA
during breast carcinogenesis. In human breast carci-
noma, both centrosome size and number, but not mi-
crotubule nucleation capacity, shows a positive cor-
relation with aneuploidy and CIN that is independent
of p53 mutation [27, 33, 37]. Centrosomal microtubule
nucleation capacity is enhanced with p53 mutation,
and in addition, correlates with loss of tissue differ-
entiation (high histological grade) and poor patient
prognosis. This suggests that in breast cancer, the
mechanisms driving CIN and loss of tissue differen-
tiation are determined by independent centrosome
defects (structural and functional, respectively),
which may not be necessarily dependent on the ab-
sence of p53 function [38]. p53 loss may play a critical
role in the generation of supernumerary centrosomes
in breast cancer cells only following genotoxic stress
or mitogenic stimulation through its abrogation of the
G1/S cell cycle checkpoint, involving a
CDK2/cyclin-dependent pathway [39, 40]. In relation,
CA and multinucleation are present in MCF7 cells as a
result of cytokinesis failure, due to the expression of
the low molecular isoform of cyclin E. This phenotype
is exacerbated in the absence of p53 and occurs
via premature activation of cdc25C [41, 42].
BRCA1 is a breast and ovary-specific tumour
suppressor that in association with BRCA1-associated
RING Domain 1 (BARD1), acts as a powerful E3
ubiquitin ligase. The BRCA1-BARD1 complex,
through the ubiquitination of gamma-tubulin, main-
tains centrosome homeostasis by prevention of its
aberrant reduplication [43]. Inhibition of BRCA1
causes rapid centrosome overduplication and possi-
bly fragmentation in human breast cell lines [43-45],
as well as stimulates centrosome microtubule nuclea-
tion function [46]. Consistent with these reports, dis-
ruption of the BRCA1 gene in mice leads to CA and
aneuploidy [47, 48]. Numerical centrosome aberration
is also associated with negative BRCA1 expression
and its germline mutations in human breast cancer
specimens [37]. Overexpression of Ninein-like protein
(Nlp), a BRCA1-associated centrosomal protein
overexpressed in human breast cancers, is associated
with CA in rodent fibroblasts as well as spontaneous
breast tumourigenesis in transgenic mice, suggesting
that Nlp overexpression mimics BRCA1 loss [49].
NPM is a BRCA2-associated protein, which together
with ROCK2 may form a complex that maintains the
numerical integrity of centrosomes and accurate cell
division. Dysfunction of this regulation might be in-
volved in the tumourigenesis of breast cancer through
both centrosome overduplication and fragmentation
[50].
Overexpresson of Aurora-A kinase, a centro-
some-associated serine/threonine kinase, and gain of
its associated gene locus on 20q13.2, leads to aneu-
ploidy, cell transformation, and CA in mammalian
cells [51]. Aurora-A overexpression is associated with
CA in DCIS [52] but not in IDC [37], suggesting that it
may be more relevant in tumour initiation than pro-
gression. Correspondingly, Aurora-A overexpression
and CA are found to be early events in mammary
tumour development in animal models [53, 54], which
may be mediated by estrogen exposure [55]. The
mechanism of CA triggered by Aurora-A may be in
Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2011, 7

1130
part due to cytokinesis failure, which is facilitated by
its effects on promoting p53 degradation [56]. Auro-
ra-A-overexpressed mice display CA, tetraploidiza-
tion and premature sister chromatid segregation prior
to tumour formation, which is aggravated by hap-
loinsufficiency of p53. The severe chromosomal ab-
normality did not cause cell death due to the con-
comitant activation of the pro-survival AKT pathway,
allowing continuous proliferation of the tetraploid
cells and accumulation of centrosomes [54]. On the
other hand, Aurora-A kinase is also known to inter-
fere with BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase function though
inhibitory phosphorylation [57], thereby also possibly
promoting centrosome overduplication and frag-
mentation. MDC1 and BRIT1, both negative regula-
tors of Aurora-A and PLK1, are observed to be in-
versely correlated with CA in human breast cancer.
MDC1-depleted cells exhibit centrosome overdupli-
cation, whilst BRIT1 depletion leads to defective cy-
tokinesis and centrosome accumulation [58]. Similar
to Aurora-A kinase is another centrosomal kinase
Nek2 that is frequently elevated in DCIS and IDC,
which promotes the accumulation of supernumerary
centrosomes via cytokinesis failure in breast epithelial
cells [59]. Oncogenic k-ras but not c-myc initiates CA
in mammary precursor lesions. Instead, c-myc in-
duces CA in tumours, pointing to a role for c-myc in
tumour progression and k-ras in initiation. Abolishing
the expression of CDK4/cyclin D1 or Nek2 abrogates
Ras-induced CA in human mammary epithelial cells,
whereas silencing cyclin E1 or B2 has no such effect
[60], suggesting that Ras-evoked CA may be an early
breast oncogenic event that occurs through a Nek2
and CDK4/cyclin D1-dependent pathway.
Pin1, a prolyl isomerase implicated in the acti-
vation of multiple oncogenic pathways, is overex-
pressed and positively correlates with CA in human
breast cancer tissue. Additionally, Pin1 localizes to
centrosomes in interphase but not mitotic cells in vitro.
Overexpression of Pin1 induces multiple rounds of
centrosome duplication in S-phase arrested cell lines,
resulting in formation of multipolar mitoses, chro-
mosomal missegregation, aneuploidy, and malignant
transformation [61]. Pin1 overexpression in mouse
mammary glands induces CA, leading to mammary
hyperplasia and malignant tumours. This suggests
that a mechanism of Pin1 overexpression and uncon-
trolled centrosome duplication cycles may contribute
to CA in breast cancer [61]. Y-box binding protein
YB-1, which is overexpressed in 75% of human breast
carcinomas, has been implicated in the generation of
CA in breast cancers as well. In transgenic mice, YB-1
expression in mammary epithelial cells provokes
breast carcinomas of different histologic types
through induction of CIN that emerges from mitotic
failure and CA. Moreover, YB-1-evoked CA occurs in
premalignant lesions and proceeds during breast
cancer development [62]. The mechanism underlying
CA in YB-1-dependent breast cancer development
probably occurrs through cytokinesis failure induced
by LIMK mislocalization, and is independent of p53
and pRb deregulation [63]. Several other mechanisms
implicated in the generation of CA in breast cancer
include the aberrant expression of LMO4 [64], cen-
trosome overduplication via nuclear expression of
endogenous aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and
cyclin E [65], as well as cell fusion following ectopic
expression of the RAD6 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme
[15].
Urogenital cancer
Prostate cancer
Support for CA contributing to genomic insta-
bility during prostate cancer development has been
derived from data showing the increased frequency of
centrosome abnormalities progressing from prostate
intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to non-metastatic and
metastatic cancers, with the extent of defects corre-
lating with the degree of CIN. Intra-tumoural centro-
some abnormalities are also more severe and less
variable in metastatic tumours than those in localized
prostatic carcinoma. Centrosome size and number, as
well as pericentrin levels are greater in high Gleason
grade tumours, which correlates with the more ad-
vanced extent of CIN in these lesions [10, 28, 66, 67]. In
support of these findings, artificial induction of cen-
trosome abnormalities in cultured prostate cells by
overexpression of the centrosome protein pericentrin
reproduces many features of aggressive prostate
cancer. Overexpression of pericentrin induces severe
centrosome and spindle defects, cellular disorganiza-
tion, genomic instability and enhances growth in
prostate epithelial cell lines [66]. There is evidence to
support a role for cytokinesis defects in the generation
of CA in prostate cancer. Overexpression of oncogenic
kinase PIM-1 in prostatic epithelial cells leads to the
development of mitotic spindle defects, multinuclea-
tion, and supernumerary centrosomes [68].
Non-functional p53 also promotes the formation of
increased centrosome number and size in prostate
cancer cell lines by abrogating the G2/M checkpoint
control [69].
Urothelial cancer
In transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the uri-
nary tract, CA is associated with CIN and aneuploidy
[70-75], but not with MIN - tumours with low expres-
sion of MLH1 or MSH2 mismatch repair proteins are
Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2011, 7

1131
not linked with CA [73]. Interestingly, coalesence of
multiple centrosomes into two functional spindle
poles occurs in 80% of chromosomally-unstable
bladder tumours, suggesting that this may be an im-
portant mechanism limiting the deleterious effects of
multipolar mitoses on the cancer cells [75]. Several
studies have found an association of centrosome ab-
erration with clinical prognostic indicators, including
high histological grade [70-72, 74, 76]. CA correlates
with recurrence-free survival and progression-free
survival, and is the strongest predictor for tumour
recurrence in non-muscle invasive urothelial cancers
of the bladder [72, 73]. However, no association with
recurrent disease, distant metastasis or cause-specific
death was demonstrated in another study on renal
and ureteric urothelial cancers [74]. Collectively, this
may suggest the presence of two distinct types of
urothelial cancers classified according to genomic
instability: i) MIN cancers that show relatively fa-
vourable prognosis and ii) CIN cancers with CA that
display highly malignant behaviour.
Like in breast cancers, the association of CA with
20q13.2 copy number gain and Aurora-A kinase
overexpression has been reported in urothelial carci-
noma, specifically in those harbouring CIN and an-
euploidy rather than MIN [72-74, 77]. Forced overex-
pression of Aurora-A in urothelial cells induced CA,
chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy [77].
Bladder cancer cell lines harbouring Aurora-A and
p53 overexpression display supernumerary centro-
somes with an even number of chromosome copy
number [78]. In clinical studies, CA in bladder TCC
specimens strongly correlates with concomitant oc-
currence of cyclin E overexpression and p53 inactiva-
tion [76], as well as cyclin D1 gene amplification [75].
Other proteins like PLK-1 and BUBR1 have been as-
sociated with CA, CIN and aneuploidy in bladder
cancer as well, but their significance remains to be
explored [79, 80]. Overall, a cooperative mechanism
for CA in bladder cancers is suggested through both
disinhibition of centrosome duplication (as a result of
cyclin E and/or cyclin D overactivity) and cytokinesis
failure (as a result of p53 mutation and/or Aurora-A
overexpression).
Renal and adrenal tumours
In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), centrosome ab-
normalities and mitotic multipolarity are present in
the subgroup displaying complex karyotypes. Inter-
estingly, telomeric dysfunction and anaphase bridges
are concomitantly observed in this subgroup of can-
cers, indicating the presence of two possibly related
mechanisms i.e. CA and telomeric dysfunction, in the
generation of genetic instability of RCC [81]. There is
also a possibility that CA is a result of cytokinetic
failure from repeated chromosomal break-
age-fusion-bridge cycles, due to mechanical blocking
of cytokinesis by anaphase bridges. Overexpression of
miR-210, a downstream target of HIF1α, has recently
been reported to evoke CA and multipolar spindle
formation in renal carcinoma cells [82]. CA has also
been reported in adrenocortical adenomas and carci-
noma [83].
Cervical cancer
The mechanisms underlying CA in high-risk
human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical
carcinogenesis has been extensively studied over the
past decade. Centrosome aberration has been
demonstrated in cervical dysplasia and invasive cer-
vical carcinoma, most of which are aneuploid and
positive for high-risk HPV infection [10]. CA is also
associated with spindle defects and correlates posi-
tively with increasing grade of dysplasia, and is
highest in lesions of invasive carcinomas [84]. Fur-
thermore, CA is detected in organotypic raft cultures
of human keratinocytes containing episomal HPV-16
DNA, even in basal cells with low copy numbers of
HPV-16 genome [85], supporting its involvement in
tumour initiation and progression.
In high-risk HPV-associated cervical carcinoma,
a collaborative effort by the HPV-encoded oncopro-
teins E6 and E7 have been implicated in the genera-
tion of supernumerary centrosomes and multipolar
mitoses, predisposing to CIN and carcinogenesis.
Whilst stable expression of E6 or E7 in primary hu-
man keratinocytes results in abnormal centrosome
numbers [13], co-expression results in an even higher
number of cells with supernumerary centrosomes
[86]. In addition, although acute expression of E7
alone rapidly induces abnormal centrosome numbers,
that of E6 alone has no such effect [13]. In a transgenic
mouse model of estrogen-induced carcinogenesis, E7
alone is sufficient to evoke CA, producing both
high-grade cervical dysplasia and invasive cervical
malignancies. E6 alone elevates centrosome copy
number but do not produce cancer in the mice.
However, E6 plus E7 additionally elevate centrosome
copy number and create large, extensively invasive
cancers, supporting the cooperative mechanism [87].
E7 drives the generation of abnormal centro-
some numbers by directly interfering with centro-
some duplication control. E7 expression rapidly in-
creases daughter centriole formation in otherwise
normal diploid cells within a single cell division cycle
prior to the development of extensive genomic insta-
bility [13, 88]. This rapid mode of centriole overdu-
plication has been demonstrated to proceed through a
Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2011, 7
http://www.biolsci.org
1132
pathway characterized by a single maternal centriole
initiating the simultaneous synthesis of two or more
daughter centrioles, necessitating CDK2/cyclin activ-
ity and PLK4 upregulation [89-91] as well as RNA
polymerase II transcription [92]. The absolute re-
quirement of CDK2 dysregulation is consistent with
the known effects of E7 on pRB inactivation [93] and
the resultant release of E2F transcription factors as
well as upregulation of CDK2/cyclin E activity
needed for S phase entry. Interestingly, although a E7
deletion mutant lacking pRB binding/degradation
properties is unable to induce centriole overduplica-
tion [13], wild-type E7 is able to induce centriole ab-
normalities in pRB/p107/p130-deficient cells [94],
implying that pRB degradation is not the only mech-
anism by which oncogenic E7 induces centriole
overduplication. This pRB/p107/p130-independent
mechanism has been suggested to be contributed by
the association of E7 with gamma-tubulin [95].
On the other hand, unlike E7, E6 probably does
not affect centrosome duplication, but instead allows
for centrosome accumulation over a prolonged period
of time in genomically-unstable cells. This centrosome
accumulation occurs in parallel with nuclear atypia
(e.g. multi-nucleation, micronuclei). Whilst many of
these cells display features of replicative senescence
which are unlikely to proliferate further [88], there
remains the likelihood of some polypoidal cells es-
caping senescence and successfully completing mito-
sis, leading to the propagation of genomical-
ly-unstable progeny. Such abnormal cells would have
avoided mitotic arrest or apoptosis since E6 interferes
with p53-dependent checkpoints by triggering the
proteasomal degradation of p53 [96]. The involvement
of E6 in the early stages of cervical carcinogenesis is
supported by studies demonstrating the presence of
centrosome abnormalities in raft cultures harbouring
genomes mutated in E7 expression [85]. Moreover, the
HPV-16 E2 protein that is required for early viral rep-
lication inhibits E7 but not E6-triggered CA [97]. In-
triguingly, E2 promotes G2/M arrest independent of
E6 and E7, characterized by the accumulation of active
CDK/cyclin B1 complexes and histone H3 phosphor-
ylation, followed by metaphase-specific apoptosis.
E2-expressing cells which spontaneously escape arrest
and apoptosis display CA and CIN [98]. Taken to-
gether, it may be speculated that in the early stages of
HPV-induced cervical carcinogenesis, centrosome
accumulation triggered by E6 and/or E2 may be the
predominant mechanisms for the generation of su-
pernumerary centrosomes; in the later stages, it is
possible that the loss of E2 may then permit E7 to take
on a predominant role through centrosome overdu-
plication, whilst E6 takes on a cooperative role by
creating a permissive milieu for genomic disintegrity
and centrosome accumulation, through the relaxation
of p53 checkpoint control.
Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that gen-
ital infection by Chlamydia trachomatis may contribute
to HPV-induced cervical cancer formation through its
disruptive effects on centrosome homeostasis. Similar
to high-risk HPV, chlamydial infection triggers the
production of supernumerary centrosomes and
chromosome segregation defects which persist even
after cells are cured with antibiotics [99]. The under-
lying mechanism possibly involves abortive cytoki-
nesis, but centriole overduplication through CDK2
and PLK4-dependent pathways appear to be pre-
dominant [100]. Additionally, CA is exacerbated by
chlamydial infection via an increase in centrosome
spread and inhibition of the spindle assembly check-
point delay to disrupt centrosome clustering [101].
This latter phenomenon may interfere with centro-
some clustering in HPV-infected cells, thereby facili-
tating multipolar mitosis and CIN.
Ovarian and testicular cancers
In ovarian adenocarcinoma, near-tetraploid tu-
mours, which display greater numerical CIN, possess
a higher degree of intratumoural CA; whereas
near-diploid tumours show fewer abnormal centro-
somes and comparatively lower numerical but higher
degrees of structural CIN [102, 103]. This implicates
upon two distinct but possibly inter-related mecha-
nisms for the generation of chromosomal aberration
in ovarian carcinoma – one via copy-number instabil-
ity associated with mitotic segregation abnormalities,
cytokinesis errors and CA, and the other through
structural change possibly as a result of impaired
DNA repair [103]. Of clinical relevance, the prognostic
significance of CA in ovarian cancer is demonstrated
by its association with higher stage, histological
grade, and the more aggressive serous-type compared
to endometroid-type tumours [102]. In testicular germ
cell tumours, those with aneuploidy are frequently
associated with CA. Aneuploid seminomas and
non-seminomas (including carcinoma-in-situ and in-
fantile yolk sac tumours) show increased numbers of
centrosomes. In contrast, the occurrence of CA in
diploid infantile teratomas is less frequent [104].
High Aurora-A kinase expression strongly asso-
ciates with supernumerary centrosome count in pri-
mary ovarian tumour cells but not in testicular germ
cell tumours [104], and is an independent predictor of
decreased survival in ovarian cancer patients [105].
Interestingly, HeyA8-MDR cells are more aggressive
and chemoresistant compared to their parental
HeyA8 cells, and their Aurora-A expression and cen-
Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2011, 7

1133
trosome count are significantly higher as well [105]. In
relation, Aurora-A overexpression in ovarian cancer
cell lines promotes CA, malformation of mitotic spin-
dles and chromosome aberration. At the same time,
Aurora-A suppresses the expression of p21, pRb, and
BRCA2 to advance cell cycle progression and to abol-
ish cellular apoptosis and DNA damage re-
sponse [106]. Ectopic expression of Aurora-A kinase
renders ovarian cancer cells resistant to drug-evoked
apoptosis by activating the AKT survival pathway in
a p53-dependent manner [107]. Taken together, this
may suggest that poor outcome in ovarian cancer pa-
tients with Aurora-A kinase overexpression and CA
may be a result of concomitant chemoresistance.
Gastrointestinal cancer
Colorectal carcinoma
CA is detected in as early as low-grade dysplas-
tic lesions of the colorectal adenoma-adenocarcinoma
sequence [10, 108, 109], is more frequent in carcinoma
compared to adenoma, and is associated with higher
histological grade of both dysplastic as well as inva-
sive lesions [109], supporting its roles in the initiation
and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) develop-
ment. In CRC cell lines, the occurrence of CA lies ex-
clusively in aneuploid but not diploid tumours, cor-
relating with severe impairment of microtubule nu-
cleation ability and chromosome segregation errors in
the aneuploid cell lines [110]. These in vitro observa-
tions correspond with findings in primary human
tissue that defects in centrosome organization, spindle
structure, and chromosome segregation often occur
within the same tumour cells, correlating with CIN
and presence of aberrant nuclei [10].
In addition to the association with aneuploidy, a
proportion of CRC cell lines with CA also contains
p53 mutations or overexpression, gains or genomic
amplification of 20q, as well as increased copies of 16p
[110]. Ectopic overexpression of Aurora-A kinase in
HCT116 cells leads to supernumerary centrosomes
and aneuploidy regardless of p53 status [111]. In the
same cell line, oncogenic beta-catenin is also required
for S-phase arrest and centrosome overduplication
[112], whilst insufficient PLK4 is associated with ab-
errant centrioles [113]. Loss of hSgo1, a protein regu-
lating chromosome segregation that is downregulated
in CRC, results in G2/M arrest and apoptosis, while
promoting CIN and CA, cytokinesis defects and mi-
totic catastrophe [114]. Telomerase transcriptional
elements-interacting factor (TEIF), a centro-
some-associated protein and transactivator of human
telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit (hTERT), is
overexpressed in colorectal adenoma and CRC com-
pared to normal tissue, and positively correlates with
CA and tumour grade [109], suggesting that telomere
dysfunction may be responsible for generation of CA
in CRC. At the same time, it is also possible that both
telomere dysfunction and CA contribute separately to
genomic instability in CRC.
Esophageal cancer
In cases of chronic esophagitis followed by Bar-
rett's metaplasia-derived adenocarcinoma, CA is fre-
quently observed in both Barrett's metaplasia and
adjacent histopathologically-normal native squamous
epithelium. Interestingly, centrosome aberrancies are
less frequent in frank adenocarcinoma compared to
Barrett's metaplasia, perhaps suggesting its relative
importance in earlier stages of carcinogenesis [115].
Hepatobiliary cancer
CA may play a role in the initiation and pro-
gression of biliary cancers. Biliary tumours including
gallbladder cancers (GC), intrahepatic cholangiocel-
lular carcinomas (CCC), and extrahepatic bile duct
cancers (BDC) display CA. CA also occurs in chronic
cholecystitis and hepatolithiasis, both potentially ne-
oplastic conditions. In addition, advanced stage can-
cers possess a higher frequency and greater levels of
CA than in the early stages [116].
In hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), intra-
tumoural CA is significantly higher in non-diploid
tumours than in diploid tumours. CA is associated
with p53 mutation but is not related to tumour stage,
size or proliferative activity [117]. The upstream
mechanisms leading to CA in HCC have been inves-
tigated in in vitro models of hepatitis B virus
(HBV)-associated hepatocarcinogenesis. Specifically,
the HBV-encoded hepatitis B virus X (HBX) oncopro-
tein promotes centrosome overduplication and cyto-
kinesis defects through its interaction with cellular
protein HBXIP [118, 119]. Additionally, HBX evokes
centrosome overduplication, multipolar spindles and
aneuploidy through cytoplasmic sequestration and
inactivation of Crm1, a Ran-GTP binding nuclear ex-
port receptor [120], as well as by activating the
Ras-MEK-MAP kinase pathway [121].
Pancreatic cancer
CA is detected in primary pancreatic exocrine
tumours, including both ductal carcinomas and ade-
nomas [122], as well as in pancreatic cancer cell lines,
particularly those with multipolar spindles, defective
mitoses and CIN [123]. Interestingly, although CA is
prevalent in exocrine tumours, endocrine malignan-
cies show normal centrosome patterns and thus may
arise through different genomic instability pathways
Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2011, 7
http://www.biolsci.org
1134
[122]. Using orthotopic transplantation of Suit-2 hu-
man pancreatic carcinoma cells into nude mice as a
model, supernumerary centrosome numbers are
found at higher frequencies in metastatic foci than in
pancreatic xenografts, correlating with multipolar
mitotic spindles and enhanced degree of CIN [124].
Aurora-A kinase is amplified in pancreatic cancer cell
lines and primary pancreatic cancer [125], and is as-
sociated with CA, giant nuclei formation and CIN in
vitro [126]. Taken together, this supports cytokinesis
failure as a major mechanism underlying CA in pan-
creatic cancer. Cytokinesis failure and the tendency of
p53-proficient binuclear and tetraploid cells to evade
the tetraploidy checkpoint are commonly observed in
an acinar-ductal transdifferentiating culture model of
pancreatic carcinogenesis, predisposing to pleiotropic
mitotic defects. In the context of p53 deficiency, un-
controlled polyploid progression ensues due to eva-
sion of the tetraploidy checkpoint during cytokinesis
failure, leading to a rapid exacerbation of CA and
aneuplody [127].
Lung cancer
CA has been demonstrated in a proportion of
lung cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma and
adenocarcinoma [10, 128, 129], and correlates with
aneuploidy. However, there is no significant rela-
tionship with clinical characteristics such as tumour
size, disease stage, or patient survival [129]. In human
lung cancer tissue, CA positively correlates with loss
of pRb expression as well as with E2F1 and cyclin E
overexpression [128, 129]. At least some cells with CA
ars also positive for p53 mutation, although correla-
tive significance is absent [128-130]. The possible as-
sociation of p53 loss with centrosome anomalies is
supported by studies on p53-knockout murine bron-
chiolar epithelial “Clara” cells, presumably the origin
of lung adenocarcinoma, which possess increased
centrosome number and multinucleation, as com-
pared to their wild-type p53 counterparts [131]. In
addition, several studies have demonstrated a rela-
tionship between exposure to carcinogens implicated
in lung cancer and the development of centrosome
abnormalities in vitro. Specifically, exposure to chrys-
otile asbestos fibres [132], chromate particles [133,
134], arsenite [135, 136] and benzo[a]pyrene diol
epoxide [137] have been shown to induce CA, multi-
polar spindles, aneuploidy, as well as malignant
transformation in human lung cell lines, which may
be conditional on p53 dysfunction. Expression of Skp2
in lung cancer cells is associated with CA as well
[138]. Recently, NORE1A, a gene commonly down-
regulated in non-small cell lung cancer, has been
shown to suppress CA induced by hydroxyurea in
lung cancer cell lines, implying a preventive role of
NORE1A against carcinogenesis of non-small cell
lung cancer [139].
Neural cancer
CA has been demonstrated in several neural
cancers [10], including aneuploid cerebral primitive
neuroectodermal tumours (PNET) with p53 mutation
[140], diffuse astrocytic gliomas of various histological
grades [141], pituitary adenomas (PA) [142], as well as
in medulloblastoma [143]. Gamma-tubulin staining is
greater in adult high grade anaplastic astrocytomas
and glioblastomas as compared to low-grade diffuse
astrocytomas [141]. Similarly, supernumerary cen-
trosomes as well as higher Aurora-A mRNA expres-
sion levels are observed in high grade but not low
grade glioma [144]. Comparing with normal brain
tissue, mRNA expression for centrosomal structural
proteins, such as centrin 3, gamma-tubulin, hNinein
isoforms 1/2/5/6, Aurora-A and Aurora-B are ele-
vated in glioma tissue [144]. Survivin suppression
leads to CA in glioma cell lines, especially in the ab-
sence of p53 [145]. Loss of PTEN and expression of
EGFRvIII transform neural precursor cells into tu-
mours resembling glioblastomas, displaying CA,
Aurora-A/B upregulation, and activation of
Ras/Erk/AKT pathways [146]. Interestingly, vari-
ously pronounced gamma-tubulin localization is
present in the cytoplasm of vascular endothelial cells
in areas of tumour angiogenesis (microvascular pro-
liferation) in glioblastomas [141]. This indicates that
CA may underlie neoplastic neovascularization in
glioblastomas. In support of this notion, endothelial
cells in solid tumours are aneuploid and are curiously
associated with multiple centrosomes as well [147].
In PA, CA is observed in somatotroph and lac-
totroph adenomas, which are characterized by aneu-
ploidy and securin overexpression, in comparison to
non-functioning adenomas or normal pituitary tissue
[142]. In a mouse study, forced transgenic expression
of cyclin E in the pituitary intermediate lobe results in
CA [148]. In medulloblastoma, overexpression of
gamma-tubulin is widespread in poorly differentiat-
ed, proliferating tumour cells but is significantly di-
minished in quiescent differentiating tumour cells
undergoing neuritogenesis [143]. In primary neuro-
blastoma tumours, childhood and infant diploid tu-
mours display greater CA than infant triploid tu-
mours. Ploidy divergence accompanying tetraploid
cells, implying cytokinesis failure, occurs very fre-
quently in infant diploid but not infant triploid tu-
mours. However, although CA is found in the major-
ity of childhood diploid tumours, none of these show
ploidy divergence, suggesting centrosome overdu-

plication as the mechanism of CA in this group of
tumours [149]. CA may be associated with MYCN
locus amplification in primary neuroblastoma [149,
150]. This is supported by in vitro observations,
whereby in neuroblastoma cell lines, MYCN overex-
pression induces CA in response to a DNA damage
stimulus such as ionizing radiation [150, 151]. Sup-
pression of p27 expression through increased expres-
sion of Skp2 [152], as well as MDM2-mediated nega-
tive regulation of p53 activity [150] may underlie this
DNA damage-evoked CA.
Head and neck cancer
CA has been observed in squamous cell carci-
nomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) [153-159], be-
nign salivary gland pleomorphic adenomas [155], as
well as in thymic carcinoid tumour [160]. Strong
prognostic implications have been demonstrated in
HNSCC. High intratumoural CA is associated with
local tumour recurrence of surgically-resected oral
SCC despite histologically-negative margins. Inter-
estingly, analysis of the tumour margins for CA found
a trend toward local tumour recurrence in patients
whose margins showed high degree of CA [154]. CA
is also observed in oral epithelial dysplasia. The per-
centage of cells containing CA is more frequent in oral
SCC than dysplasia, as well as in poorly-differentiated
oral SCC relative to moderate- and well-differentiated
subtypes [158]. Collectively, this strongly implicates
upon CA as a major mechanism driving the initiation
and progression HNSCC. In laryngeal SCC, presence
of cells with large centrosomes is a better predictor of
tumour recurrence compared to T stage, and even
predicts recurrence in node-negative tumours.
Moreover, this group of patients shows a
near-significant trend for shorter survival and thus
poor prognosis [159]. In another study, CA is associ-
ated with tumour size, stage, distant metastasis, dis-
ease-free survival and overall survival [157].
There is evidence to support cytokinesis failure
as the major mechanism underlying CA in HNSCC,
which may involve Aurora-A kinase upregulation
[156], MDM2-p53 dysregulation [153], and decreased
myosin light chain phosphorylation [161]. Aurora-A
kinase mRNA and protein upregulation are fre-
quently occurring in HNSCC and are associated with
CA and poor patient prognosis [156]. The underlying
mechanism linking Aurora-A kinase overexpression
and CA remains unclear, but its interaction with im-
portant cell cycle regulators such as p53 may be con-
tributory. Notably, Aurora-A kinase is known to
phosphorylate and promote the MDM2-mediated
degradation of p53 [56]. In earlier studies, CA have
been correlated with the occurrence of either muta-
tion/deletion of p53. Interestingly, in tumours that
retained wild-type p53, CA is associated with MDM2
overexpression instead [153]. In corroboration with
these findings, Swiss 3T3 cells overexpressing sta-
bly-transfected MDM2 show extensive CA and CIN,
despite retaining wild-type p53 [153]. The actual rela-
tionship between Aurora-A kinase and the
MDM2-p53 pathway in generating CA in HNSCC
remains to be further elucidated.
Dysfunctional telomeres have been suggested to
play a possible role in the generation of CA in
HNSCC. HNSCC and benign salivary gland pleo-
morphic adenomas displaying abnormal karyotypes
showed widespread centrosome aberration and mul-
tipolar division, together with anaphase bridges. The
frequency of anaphase bridges correlates with num-
ber of chromosome ends lacking TTAGGG signals,
indicating the presence of telomere shortening. This
repeated chromosomal breakage-fusion-bridge cycles
has been proposed to prevent normal cytokinesis,
leading to centrosome accumulation along with mul-
tinucleation, multipolar cell division, and aneuploidy
[155]. These cells however, may be at an evolutionary
dead-end with limited contribution towards tumour
development, since mitoses with five or more poles
are very rarely observed [155].
Bone and soft tissue tumour
Bone and soft tissue sarcoma
CA has been detected in various types of ma-
lignant and borderline malignant sarcomas, including
osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, malignant fibrous
histiocytoma (MFH), haemangiopericytoma, atypical
lipomatous tumour, liposarcoma, giant cell tumour,
peripheral PNET, synovial sarcoma, rhabdomyosar-
coma, leiomyosarcoma as well as malignant periph-
eral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) [162-167]. In sev-
eral types of sarcomas, aneuploid karyotypes are
strongly associated with supernumerary centrosomes
and multipolar mitoses, as well as anaphase bridges.
Furthermore, supernumerary centrosomes and mul-
tipolar mitoses are positively correlated with ana-
phase bridges, supporting both types of abnormal
chromosome segregation in the evolution of CIN in
these soft tissue sarcomas [164]. A small study of six
well-differentiated liposarcomas of both near-diploid
(Type D) and near-tetraploid (Type H) cytogenetic
subtypes display CA, independent of their ploidy
status, although Type H tumours demonstrate higher
intratumoural degrees of centrosome number short of
statistically significance [165].
Numerical CA is more frequently observed in
highly aggressive types of sarcomas, including PNET,
Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2011, 7
http://www.biolsci.org
1136
synovial sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, MFH, as
compared to moderate grade sarcomas such as lipo-
sarcoma and leiomyosarcoma [166]. The degree of CA
is also significantly higher in recurrent and malignant
cases than in non-recurrent cases of giant cell tumour
of bone [167], in which a positive correlation exists
between aneuploidy and CA. Interestingly, benign or
tumour-like lesions of soft tissue may also feature CA,
albeit at lower frequencies [164-166].
Analysis of p53-mutant osteosarcoma cell lines
reveals a wide range of aneusomy, high levels of
atypical mitotic figures, and high frequencies of ab-
normal centrosome numbers, as compared to p53
wild-type cell lines [163]. Furthermore, treatment with
colcemid, a spindle-disrupting polyploidizing agent,
induces multipolar cell division and supernumerary
centrosomes in an MDM2-amplified osteosarcoma
cell line but not in normal fibroblasts [164]. This may
implicate a defective p53 pathway in the generation of
centrosome aberration and CIN in osteosarcoma.
Similar to earlier reports in colorectal adenoma
and CRC [109], TEIF positively correlates with CA in
soft tissue sarcomas, and is related to tumour grade
[166]. In addition, in vitro overexpression of TEIF lev-
els either exogenously introduced, or evoked by
DNA-damaging agents or telomeric dysfunction
promotes multinucleation, CA, mitotic defects, and
chromosome missegregation [166]. Collectively, this
suggests that DNA damage evokes TEIF centrosomal
expression, resulting in CA and genomic instability
that contributes to tumour progression.
Kaposi sarcoma
The Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus
(KSHV) has been linked with several human malig-
nancies, including all subtypes of Kaposi sarcoma,
primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Cas-
tleman disease. Kaposi sarcoma lesions are latently
infected by KSHV and express latent genes, such as
KSHV cyclin (K cyclin) and latency associated nuclear
antigen (LANA). Expression of K cyclin in human
endothelial cells induces senescence and strong DNA
damage response, leading to CA and S-phase arrest
through a CDK6 and ATM-Chk2-dependent pathway
[168]. In human and mouse primary fibroblasts, K
cyclin expression results in a p53-dependent growth
arrest, abortive cytokinesis and centrosome accumu-
lation [169]. In the absence of p53, the K cy-
clin-induced CA is exacerbated, leading to the acqui-
sition of an aneuploid population of cells which is not
only genetically unstable but also resistant to apopto-
sis [169]. In line with these findings, in vivo studies
demonstrated accelerated K cyclin-induced lym-
phomagenesis in mice without p53 [170]. Notably,
KSHV infection of endothelial cells generates super-
numerary centrosomes and multinucleation [168,
171], suggesting that the hindrance of tumour pro-
gression due to p53-triggered growth arrest and
apoptosis may be overcome by other latent viral
genes. Indeed, LANA is able to bind p53 and inhibits
the ability of p53 to transactivate cellular genes, re-
sulting in abnormal centrosomes, multinuclear cells,
and other genomic abnormalities [172]. In
KSHV-infected cells, NPM1 is a phosphorylation
substrate for CDK6/K cyclin necessary for centro-
some duplication, and p53-driven apoptosis occurring
downstream of NPM1 phosphorylation is a critical
checkpoint mechanism that prevents accumulation of
cells with supernumerary centrosomes, which may be
overcome by LANA co-expression [173].
Centrosome amplification in haematologi-
cal malignancies
In addition to solid neoplasms, centrosome ab-
errations are common in several haematological ma-
lignancies including Hodgkin's (HL) as well as
non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), acute (AML) and
chronic myeloid leukaemias (CML),
HTLV-1-associated adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) and
multiple myeloma (MM). In analogy to solid tumours,
a correlation between CA and CIN as well as clinical
aggressiveness also exists in certain haematological
malignancies [174].
Non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma
Centrosome defects, predominantly structural in
nature, are frequently detected in several subtypes of
B-cell lineage NHL including diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL),
Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), follicular lymphoma (FL),
marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZBCL), as well as
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) [175, 176]. Sim-
ilar abnormalities occur in Hodgkin and
Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells in classic HL [177, 178].
Aggressive lymphomas like DLBCL, MCL and
BL harbour more centrosome abnormalities than in-
dolent lymphomas including FL and MZBCL. In ac-
cordance, the degree of CA is associated with the
proliferation/mitotic index, irrespective of histologi-
cal subgroup (FL, DLBCL and MCL). In FL, the
number of cells with CA correlates with increased
histological grading; whilst in MCL, CA occurs at a
higher frequency in blastoid variants harbouring
near-tetraploid chromosome numbers as compared to
the less aggressive diploid subtypes [175]. In contrast,
the latter correlation is not seen in FL and DLBCL. The
significance of the centrosome in MCL subtyping and
prognostication is further supported by a gene ex-

pression signature inclusive of centrosome proteins
CAMKK2, PCNT2, TUBGCP3 and TUBGCP4, which
discriminated between near-tetraploid and diploid
MCL [179]. Centrosome abnormalities are observed in
B cell CLL and even at the premalignant monoclonal
B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) stage. The extent of CA
correlates with the clinical aggressiveness and prolif-
erative activity of the CLL cases as measured by
lymphocyte doubling time as well as with time to first
treatment [176]. However, there is no correlation with
IgVH gene mutation status or cytogenetically-defined
risk groups (11q22-23, 17p13 and 13q14 deletions;
trisomy 12). This is corroborated with the finding that
no difference exists between CLL subgroups with or
without the same specific chromosome aberrations
with prognostic significance [180].
Apart from B-cell neoplasms, numerical and
structural centrosome aberrations are present in
ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)
as well, a T-cell derived neoplasm characterized by
t(2;5) rearrangements, resulting in the creation of fu-
sion genes involving the ALK locus [181]. No correla-
tion between CA and p53 status is apparent in ALCL.
Despite the prevalence of CA, ALK-positive ALCL is
known to be relatively chromosomally stable, with
only few secondary abnormalities on top of the pri-
mary t(2;5) or variant translocations. On a similar
note, in a detailed analysis of a single case of BL with
extensive CA, there was an absence of ongoing nu-
merical CIN, supporting the notion that CA is not a
universal surrogate marker CIN [182].
Chronic myeloid leukaemia
In CML patients, the presence of CA in CD34+
BCR-ABL1-positive cells is an early event in CML
development, and precedes CIN that is associated
with advanced disease. Cells from chronic phase (CP)
specimens display mostly numerical centrosome ab-
normalities with a uniform morphology, in contrast to
those from blast crisis (BC) specimens showing irreg-
ularly-shaped amorphous amplification (so-called
"centriolar satellite material") on top of a high rate of
numerical alteration [183, 184]. Cells with CA are
more evident in BC in comparison to CP specimens
while the extent of CA strongly correlate with karyo-
type instability and aneuploidy, giving support to a
prognostic value of centrosome status in CML [183].
CML is characterized by the BCR-ABL1 trans-
location, which produces the p210BCR-ABL1 fusion pro-
tein that localizes to the centrosome in K562 cell lines.
Cell lines expressing p210BCR-ABL1 exhibit more CA
than p210BCR-ABL1 negative cells [184], in keeping with
earlier observations that BCR-ABL1 transgene ex-
pression induces CA in cell lines in a time-dependent
manner [185]. Interestingly, tyrosine kinase inhibitors
including imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib lead to de
novo induction of CA, lending a possible explanation
to the emergence of BCR-ABL1-negative clones with
aberrant karyotypes and secondary malignancies (e.g.
AML and myelodysplastic syndrome) with prolonged
treatment using these drugs [184-188]. CA has also
been detected in disease-unrelated cells/tissues in
patients treated with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors bosu-
tinib, dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib, sorafenib and
sunititib [189]. These findings though, remain more of
a scientific enigma. It cannot be excluded that these
genomically-unstable cells would be incapable of
further proliferation, and thus do not pose any sig-
nificant danger towards neoplastic development.
Acute myeloid leukaemia
Numerical and structural CA has been described
as a potential cause of aneuploidy in AML. AML
blasts with high degree of numerical and structural
CA contain numerical CIN, and possess higher ex-
pression levels of genes coding for proteins involved
in stimulating G1/S transition, DNA replication, as
well as centrosome-associated proteins such as peri-
centrin and TUBGCP2. Furthermore, higher frequen-
cy of CA is associated with cytogenetically-defined
adverse risk groups, as defined by the MRC AML 10
trial as favourable (22.5%), intermediate (35.3%), and
adverse (50.3%). Interestingly, this is mainly at-
tributed to structural rather than numerical centro-
some aberrations [190, 191]. Numerical centrosome
abnormalities are observed in a study of 25 patients
with hematopoietic bone marrow failure disorders
with a risk for evolution into AML, including myel-
odysplastic syndrome, aplastic anaemia, and parox-
ysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria. Increased centro-
some copy number positively correlates with aneu-
ploidy, and samples with the highest percentage of
CA tends to be aneuploid for the most chromosomes.
This suggests that CA may be associated with the
development of a clonal population of potentially
pre-leukemic aneuploid hematopoietic progenitor
cells in bone marrow failure patients [192].
Adult T-cell leukaemia
CA is also observed in ATL, a condition causally
linked to human T lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1)
infection [193, 194]. Tax, a HTLV-1 transactivator
protein, localizes to the centrosome, deregulates CDK
activity and induces CA in JPX-9 cell lines, suggesting
an association with cellular transformation by
HTLV-1 and CIN in HTLV-1-infected human T cells
[194]. Tax may be directly responsible for genomic
instability and aneuploidy in ATL cells through the
Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2011, 7
http://www.biolsci.org
1138
interaction with Ran-BP1 and coiled-coil protein
TaxIBP2. The interaction of Tax with Ran-GTPase
pathway via Ran-BP1 regulates centrosome stability
and is necessary for Tax localization to centrosomes as
well as its induction of CA. Disruption of Tax-
IBP2-Tax interaction results in failure of CA triggering
by Tax, while TaxIBP2 downregulation leads to CA,
suggesting that TaxIBP2 is an intrinsic block to cen-
trosome overduplication [193, 195, 196].
Multiple myeloma
CA is common in MM and is already present in
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined signifi-
cance (MGUS), suggesting an early role in myelo-
magenesis. The percentage of plasma cells with CA
increases progressively from MGUS to smouldering
MM to MM, implicating that CA contributes towards
increasing genomic instability and disease progres-
sion [12, 197]. Structural centrosome abnormalities are
mainly seen in MM rather than MGUS. Interestingly,
no difference in CA exists between ploidy categories
in myeloma, suggesting that CA contributes to ge-
nomic instability in both tumour subgroups. Ex-
panding upon these observations, CA is also evident
in B-cells of MM patients, supporting the existence of
an abnormal clonal population of B-cells which may
be precursors of malignant plasma cells [198].
Chng et al. demonstrated that a gene expres-
sion-derived "centrosome index" (CI) composed of the
expression of genes encoding for major centrosome
components - centrin, gamma-tubulin, and pericen-
trin, is a strong surrogate of CA in MM. Tumours with
high CI overexpressed genes coding for proteins in-
volved in cell cycle, proliferation, DNA damage, and
G2/M checkpoints, as well as those associated with
the centrosome and kinetochore or microtubules. In
MM patients, a high CI is associated with poor prog-
nostic features, including chromosome 13 deletion,
t(4;14), t(14;16) and high plasma cell labelling index.
Correspondingly, a high CI is a powerful independent
poor prognostic factor regardless of disease phase
(newly diagnosed or relapsed), therapeutic modality,
or disease stage [12, 199, 200].
Some of the plausible mechanisms underlying
CA in multiple myeloma have been discussed re-
cently [200]. Of particular significance, elevated ex-
pression of RHAMM correlates with centrosome
structural abnormalities in multiple myeloma; whilst
introduction of exogenous RHAMM, which localizes
to the centrosome, triggers an increase in centrosome
size as well as gamma-tubulin levels, and induces
aberrant mitoses [197]. In addition, Aurora-A kinase
has been shown to be significantly overexpressed in
multiple myeloma with a high centrosome index
[199].
Diagnostic, predictive and prognostic im-
plications
The diagnostic utility of centrosome abnormali-
ties has been repeatedly discussed in previous stud-
ies, yet its usefulness as a biomarker for cancer detec-
tion has never been thoroughly investigated. Based on
earlier observations, CA in normal or benign tissue is
a rare phenomenon. In most studies, no CA could be
detected in normal human cells including those of the
breast, prostate, lung, brain, colon [10], bladder [76],
kidney [81], cervix [84], testis [104], ovary [105], liver
[117], pancreas [122], head and neck [157], and blood
[183] in contrast to their malignant counterparts.
However, in studies on benign breast lesions, centro-
some abnormalities were not found in mastopathia or
fibroadenoma [29], while another study observed
structural centrosomal abnormalities occasionally in
the benign lesions studied (3 of 25, including masto-
pathia, intraductal papilloma and fibrocystic mas-
topathy) [35]. Apart from those of the breast,
non-malignant tumours from other sites such as soft
tissue [81, 165, 166] and pancreatic adenoma [122]
have been shown to harbour CA, suggesting that the
presence of CA alone is not a sufficient criterion to
diagnose malignancy. In addition, although CA is
frequently present to some extent in most cancers, it is
not an invariable phenomenon [Table 1]. Thus, the
lack of CA may not necessarily exclude malignancy
either. Nonetheless, the utility of centrosome status as
a differential diagnostic marker may be augmented
when employed in adjunct to contemporary methods.
CA may also be of clinical utility where tissue availa-
bility is limited, as demonstrated in cytological aspi-
rates of breast lesions [29, 35].
In HNSCC, those with high degree of CA in
tumour margins recur more frequently than those
with less CA. This finding is interesting, given that
these margins are histologically negative for malig-
nant cells, the latter of which clinically implies ade-
quate surgical resection [154]. Given such observa-
tions, it is tempting to speculate that malignant, or at
least potentially malignant cells harbouring CA
within these margins that escape histological detec-
tion, may be responsible for eventual tumour recur-
rence and poor prognosis. In parallel, CA occurs in
matched adjacent normal or hyperplastic regions of
NSCLC as well [128, 129], although their clinical sig-
nificance remains unknown. In such cases, CA in the
tumours and/or their margins may define a subgroup
of patients who may benefit from more extensive cu-
Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2011, 7

1139
rative surgery, more aggressive adjuvant treatment,
and closer monitoring for disease recurrence.
Finally, can CA be a surrogate for aggressive
tumour phenotype? Phenotypic heterogeneity gener-
ated as a result of CIN and aneuploidy allows for se-
lection of a superior karyotypic clone that may confer
survival advantage through a Darwinian selection
process, which in turn promotes tumour aggressive-
ness, progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance
[Figure 1]. As summarized in Table 3, CA is not only
characteristic of tumours in general, but is also more
pronounced in advanced stage and tumour grade, as
well as correlates with early disease recurrence, dis-
ease progression and poor survival in many cases.
Together with other established prognostic factors,
CA may prove to be helpful in predicting outcomes
and survival of patients with cancer.
The centrosome as a cancer therapeutic
target
Potentially, the centrosome can be a therapeutic
target for the treatment of cancers. The selective kill-
ing of cells with CA has been investigated via target-
ing specific altered proteins/pathways peculiar to
these cells. Centrosome duplication in normal
non-neoplastic cells differs mechanistically from
pathways leading to CA in cancer cells, and these
differences may be exploited to selectively kill target
cancer cells while leaving normal cells relatively un-
affected [89-91]. Of particular significance, small
molecule centrosome-associated protein kinase inhib-
itors, such as Aurora-A kinase and Polo-like kinase
inhibitors have recently shown promising results in
clinical trials [201]. Also, AhR agonists such as indi-
rubins reduce centriole overduplication and may im-
ply a novel role for chemoprevention in breast cancer
[65]. Likewise, targeting the compensatory mecha-
nisms of bipolar spindle formation, such as inhibition
of centrosome clustering, may be a potential mode of
promoting cancer cell death [21]. Conversely, it may
also be plausible that agents that promote centrosome
clustering may delay tumour progression by limiting
CIN.
Another attractive approach to discriminatory
cancer cell eradication invokes exploiting the possible
additional burden of excess centrosomes on the cell
cycle [202]. In these cells with CA, the threshold to
apoptosis induced by drugs [203] or radiation [145]
may be much lower. For example, the partial inhibi-
tion of PARP1 in BRCA1-deficient cells has been
suggested to represent a possible chemopreventive or
therapeutic approach for BRCA1-deficient breast
cancers, via its induction of severe chromosome ab-
errations, CA, telomere dysfunction and apoptosis
[204]. Survivin inhibition in glioma cells has also been
shown to enhance CIN and radiosensitivity via in-
duction of CA [145]. The induction of CA using agents
that delay S-phase but at insufficient doses to trigger
apoptosis, such as low dose 5-FU, has been suggested
as a novel mode of chemosensitization approach to
cancer therapy [203]. However in all these approach-
es, one should be mindful of evoking CA in normal
cells and risk of secondary carcinogenesis as a con-
sequence of amplified genomic instability. In addi-
tion, cancer cells which evade apoptosis despite being
induced with a greater degree of centrosome aberra-
tion and genomic instability may eventually develop
an even more aggressive phenotype. These theoretical
concerns warrant further investigations before this
therapeutic approach may be considered for clinical
utility.
Conclusion and future perspectives
CA is a common phenomenon in various human
malignancies and may play a dominant role in tu-
mour initiation and progression. Given the present
evidence, it is most likely that CA represents, but not
necessarily always, one of the major mechanisms un-
derlying CIN and aneuploidy in cancer cells. Alt-
hough the list of clinical studies on centrosomes and
human cancers is growing rapidly, methodological
issues place upon a significant limitation on data in-
terpretation, as many studies use only su-
per-numeration as the sole marker for CA rather than
considering structural and functional aberrations
concurrently. Although these types of aberrations
often occur together, their biological and clinical con-
sequences may be different. In addition, studies based
on single section histological specimens will discount
centrosomes unseen at that particular cut, therefore
underestimating the true incidence of CA, as well as
their association with concurrent molecular events.
Future studies should take on a holistic approach to
understanding the contribution of numerical, struc-
tural as well as functional centrosome abnormalities
to specific human cancers throughout the course of
tumour development, with particular respect to the
generation of CIN and aneuploidy. Finally, a
cell-to-cell based examination for specific molecular
alterations associated with centrosome defects may
reveal unique mechanistic correlations that would
have been missed on simple linear correlative analy-
sis. A better delineation of the detailed molecular
circuitry regulating centrosome biology will be in-
dispensable for a more intricate manipulation of these
pathways for clinical application.
