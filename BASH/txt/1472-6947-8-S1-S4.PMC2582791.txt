Abstract
Background: WHO-ART and MedDRA are medical terminologies used for the coding of
adverse drug reactions in pharmacovigilance databases. MedDRA proposes 13 Special
Search Categories (SSC) grouping terms associated to specific medical conditions. For
instance, the SSC "Haemorrhage" includes 346 MedDRA terms among which 55 are also
WHO-ART terms. WHO-ART itself does not provide such groupings. Our main
contention is the possibility of classifying WHO-ART terms in semantic categories by using
knowledge extracted from SNOMED CT. A previous paper presents the way WHO-ART
term definitions have been automatically generated in a description logics formalism by using
their corresponding SNOMED CT synonyms. Based on synonymy and relative position of
WHO-ART terms in SNOMED CT, specialization or generalization relationships could be
inferred. This strategy is successful for grouping the WHO-ART terms present in most
MedDRA SSCs. However the strategy failed when SSC were organized on other basis than
taxonomy.
Methods: We propose a new method that improves the previous WHO-ART structure
by integrating the associative relationships included in SNOMED CT.
Results: The new method improves the groupings. For example, none of the 55 WHO-
ART terms in the Haemorrhage SSC were matched using the previous method. With the
new method, we improve the groupings and obtain 87% coverage of the Haemorrhage SSC.
Conclusion: SNOMED CT's terminological structure can be used to perform automated
groupings in WHO-ART. This work proves that groupings already present in the MedDRA
SSCs (e.g. the haemorrhage SSC) may be retrieved using classification in SNOMED CT.

Background
WHO-ART (World Health Organization – Adverse Reac-
tion Terminology) and MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for
Drug Regulatory Activities) are the terminologies used in
pharmacovigilance for case report coding and statistical
data analysis. The generation of new knowledge on
adverse drug reactions (also called signal detection)
depends on the structure of the terminology. On the one
hand, terminologies require terms as specific as possible
in order to allow precise coding. On the other hand, signal
detection commonly requires similar conditions to be rec-
ognized together in order to identify drug related prob-
lems [1-3]. In other words, precise coding requires a large
number of (precise) terms, and statistical analysis requires
a highly interconnected structure linking these terms.
These requirements are highly interdependent. If the con-
cepts are numerous but not sufficiently connected, statis-
tical analysis will be done on sparse data and drug safety
signals based on groupings will be more difficult to detect.
Medical problem oriented groupings have been manually
introduced in MedDRA. Special search categories (SSC)
are sets of MedDRA preferred terms related to a specific
medical condition, for example "Upper gastro-intestinal
bleeding conditions" or "Haemorrhage conditions".
Recently, Standard MedDRA Queries (SMQ) replaced the
SSCs. The SMQs have the same utility as the SSCs and are
also manually defined.
WHO-ART does not provide such groupings of terms. The
WHO-ART terminology has a hierarchical structure with
restricted multiple inheritance, to avoid double counting
of the same case through common drug surveillance (e.g.
if the WHO-ART term corresponding to a drug safety
report would be located in more than one unique cate-
gory). The hierarchical structure is organized on three lev-
els, but most of the terms appear on the first two levels as
the second hierarchical level does not exist for two thirds
of the coding terms. Sometimes terms with different levels
of generalization may be siblings. As a consequence,
grouping similar terms based on WHO-ART hierarchy will
provide either very large clusters or very small ones not
allowing tuning the focus of statistical analysis on specific
or specifically related medical conditions.
In a previous paper we described a method for grouping
WHO-ART terms related to common medical conditions
[4]. The general idea was to propose a model to capture
the meaning of WHO-ART terms within formal defini-
tions in order to improve its hierarchical structure (and
the grouping through querying). This model defined each
term to be a synonym of a SNOMED CT concept. For
example, the WHO-ART sibling terms "Thrombosis arte-
rial" and "Thrombosis" have synonyms in SNOMED CT
and these synonyms are related (i.e. "Thrombosis arterial"
is a "Thrombosis"). Then, based on synonymy and rela-
tive position in SNOMED CT [5], two WHO-ART terms
can be compared according to the generalization – spe-
cialization relation present in SNOMED CT (e.g. in WHO-
ART the relation becomes "Thrombosis arterial" is a
"Thrombosis").
In this previous experiment, we compared the MedDRA
SSC (restricted to WHO-ART terms) to the groupings
obtained automatically by classification based on the for-
mal definitions of WHO-ART terms. WHO-ART terms
present in SSCs were automatically retrieved. We were
able to create grouping classes. For example, the medical
search term "Disorders of Pregnancy" was automatically
filled with several WHO-ART terms amongst which
"Abortion", "Eclampsia", "Hydramnios", "Uterine atony"
and "Uterine spasm". Most WHO-ART terms included in
the MedDRA SSCs were automatically retrieved. However
we found some drastic limitations due to the fact that
these groupings are based only on a generalization – spe-
cialization relation and therefore limited to the high level
grouping classes that the editors of SNOMED CT consid-
ered relevant (e.g. "Pain related disorders" but not "Pain
located in digestive structure disorders"). For example,
none of the 55 WHO-ART terms in the Haemorrhage SSC
were found (e.g. "Haematoma", "Ecchymosis", etc.).
Consequently, the method needs to be improved to take
into account groupings that rely also on associative rela-
tions such as "has location", "has morphology" or "has
causative agent". A great effort has been done to make the
meaning of medical concepts in SNOMED CT explicit for
computers and this work is continued with every new
release of SNOMED CT. For instance, all the pathologies
associated to an inflammatory morphology are linked by
the "has morphology" relation to the "Inflammation"
concept. In the SNOMED CT hierarchy, the meaning of
inflammation is furthermore divided in subclasses corre-
sponding to different types of inflammation (e.g. necro-
tizing inflammation, acute inflammation, and chronic
inflammation).
The objective of this work is to enrich the formal defini-
tions of the WHO-ART terms by taking into account asso-
ciative relations. We propose a Description Logic model
corresponding to the following requirements:
1. The model should be populated with automatically
extracted knowledge.
2. Classification of the model should retrieve clusters of
medically related terms on given criteria.
We first describe the SNOMED-CT and WHO-ART termi-
nologies. Then we present the logic description model for

description of WHO-ART terms and the query mecha-
nism. After presenting results of groupings using the new
method we finally discuss the methodology to use for
automated grouping and give an appraisal of the results.
Materials
Our material includes the WHO-ART (2004 third quarter)
and the SNOMED CT terminologies. SNOMED CT is
available through UMLS (2005AA).
WHO-ART [6] is organized in three hierarchical levels.
HLTs and PTs are linked to included terms (IT) that are
synonymous or more specific than the former therefore
we did not take into account the IT as hierarchical level.
1) The included terms (IT) and preferred terms (PT) level,
which is recommended for the coding of adverse drug
reactions (ADRs) and detailed drug safety statistical anal-
ysis.
2) High level term is a first grouping level. Only 31.3% of
PTs are grouped in high level terms classes (HLT). The
remaining PTs (68.7%) are linked directly to a system
organ class (SOC). For example, the preferred term "Car-
diomyopathy" is linked to the "Myo endo pericardial
valve disorders" and "Body as a whole general disorders"
SOCs.
3) At the most general level, PTs are grouped according to
32 system organ classes (SOC). SOCs group terms accord-
ing to anatomy (e.g. "Gastrointestinal disorders") and/or
public health medical problems (e.g. "Neoplasm").
The SOCs level is used for periodical statistical surveil-
lance of national or international regulatory authorities.
Under the SOC level, the polyhierarchy is forbidden in
order to avoid double counting of an adverse reaction
event. However a WHO-ART term can appear in up to
three SOCs (one primary and two secondary).
As said earlier, clusters based on the native WHO-ART ter-
minological structure (i.e. HLT, SOC) lead either towards
very large semantic clusters (an average of 58 terms for
SOCs) or very specific, granular ones (an average of 4
terms for HLTs).
SNOMED CT has a polyhierarchical structure and a large
coverage of the medical domain [5] (approximately 350
thousand terms). It has a broader scope than coding
ADRs. A large part of SNOMED CT consists of atomic con-
cepts; they are finer-grained than the WHO-ART concepts
and can be used as primitive concepts.
In a previous paper we generated an ontology based on
the synonymy relationships between WHO-ART and
SNOMED CT concepts [4]. The structure of SNOMED CT
states the relative positions of the corresponding synony-
mous SNOMED CT concepts. This structure is based on
the medical domain common sense and, in our case, it
corresponds to the generalization – specialization rela-
tions represented as a hierarchy which, along with the syn-
onymy relationship, will induce the generalization –
specialization relations among WHO-ART concepts. In
other words, we are relying on the SNOMED CT structure
to discriminate WHO-ART terms.
At the implementation level, the classification task is
based on the Description Logic (DL) principles. The Web
Ontology Language (OWL DL) is a standard for knowl-
edge representation that facilitates high machine inter-
pretability. OWL provides existential quantification that
allows one to describe, for example, the concept of "ADRs
having a haemorrhage morphology" as "hasMorphology
some Haemorrhage". Here, "hasMorphology" has the
function of a role with "Haemorrage" as its role filler. The
existential quantifier means that for each individual
object that instantiates the expression "hasMorphology
some Haemorrhage" there is at least one instance of the
concept Haemorrhage related by the relation hasMor-
phology. For building the ontology, we have used Protégé
as one of the most actively developed OWL enabled ontol-
ogy editors [7], together with Racer, an inference engine
performing automatic classification [8].
Methods
In this section, we first present the main idea of our
approach. It is centred around the synonymy relationship
and the exploitation of the SNOMED CT hierarchy to sup-
port the reasoning process. Secondly, we present a meth-
odology for acquiring formal definitions of WHO-ART
terms and for querying the resulting model.
The automated reasoning process within ontology is
called subsumption and it relies on the set theory applied
to possible instances of a certain concept. A concept A
subsumes a concept B if and only if all the possible
instances of B are also instances of A. The subsumption
mechanism is preserved by the relationship "is synony-
mous". Therefore, if A "is synonymous" with a, B "is syn-
onymous" with b and a subsumes b the inference engine
will conclude that A subsumes B (see Figure 1).
The "synonymy" relationship as defined above is a struc-
turing relationship when the target terms of the relation
(fillers; i.e. a and b in the previous example) belong
already to a hierarchy. The hierarchical relations in
SNOMED CT induce a discriminative property to the syn-
onymy relation. Based on that, the defined WHO-ART
concepts can be placed in a hierarchy (see Figure 1).

Both SNOMED CT and WHO-ART are included in the
Metathesaurus of the Unified Medical Language System
(UMLS). Here, a concept is build based on the synonymy
relation between terms coming from different source
vocabularies. In our ontology, the synonymy relations are
those extracted from UMLS [3].
Sometimes terms not considered synonymous by the
SNOMED CT editors can be part of the same UMLS con-
cept (e.g. "Aplastic anemia", "Aplastic anemia NOS" and
"Hematopoietic aplasia"). This is due to the fact that
SNOMED CT is more granular than most of the UMLS
sources.
Within the UMLS Metathesaurus, a WHO-ART term has a
small number of SNOMED CT synonyms. An ideal synon-
ymy relation would be a "one-to-one" relationship
between a WHO-ART concept and a SNOMED CT con-
cept. The "one-to-one" or "one-to-few" relationship is
very important in our model where the discriminative
power is given by the SNOMED CT hierarchy (Figure 1).
Ensuring consistent synonymy across millions of concepts
in the UMLS Metathesaurus is difficult and depending on
use sometimes not appropriate [9]. Several SNOMED CT
concepts may be proposed as synonyms of the same
WHO-ART concept although they have different mean-
ings. This fact raises some modelling issues on the logical
operators (AND/OR) which stand between the different
asserted synonymous terms. In subsumption, which is
defined as a strict set inclusion condition, these logical
operators act like the intersection/union (AND/OR) oper-
ators. Assuming a perfect synonymy, the operator would
not matter: if a synonym to b then a ≡ b as well as (a ʝ b)
≡ (a ʜ b).

In the present work, we use "OR" between SNOMED CT
synonyms of the same WHO-ART term in order to capture
all the meanings of a WHO-ART concept in the formal
definition.
Besides differentiating WHO-ART concepts, SNOMED CT
provides multiple inheritance of concepts. SNOMED CT
makes possible the grouping of WHO-ART concepts
thanks to the high level categories (grouping classes), how-
ever limited to the ones that the editors of SNOMED CT
considered relevant (e.g. in SNOMED CT there is a "Pain
related disorders" grouping, but not "Hemorrhage related
disorders" [3]).
The methodology is organized in three steps. During the
first step, the synonymous SNOMED CT terms are
extracted from the UMLS Metathesaurus and linked to
corresponding WHO-ART concepts. The first step is fully
described in our previous work [4] and has been shortly
presented in the current section. The second and third
steps are described in the following sections. During the
second step, associative relations are added in order to
refine the synonym-based ontology. The last step involves
the methodology for querying the model and grouping
terms according to given criteria.
Refinement of synonymy-based ontology
The synonym-based ontology is used as a starting point
for the addition of the associative relationships (e.g. rela-
tions like "has morphology" are associative relations).
When a large amount of concepts are related to one or few
concepts, the associative relations have a grouping role
(e.g. there are numerous inflammatory medical condi-
tions and they are all related to "Inflammation" itself or to
specializations of "Inflammation": acute inflammation,
etc.). Combining the associative relations and the primitive
grouping concepts (e.g. inflammation) is a very flexible way
to get different situation-tailored clusters of terms that can
be very useful for data retrieval.
The same relation having multiple objects (e.g. Mallory-
Weiss syndrome has "Laceration" and "Haemorrhage" as
object for "has associated morphology") raises the ques-
tion of what logical operator to choose to relate them. We
chose the "AND" operator in order to create a multiple
inheritance (e.g. Mallory-Weiss syndrome will be both in
"Laceration related disorders" as well as in "Haemorrhage
related disorders"). This choice is motivated by the fact
that "AND" is computed as an intersection operation on
sets and that the subsumption is inferred based on the
strict inclusion operator on sets. An intersection of sets
will always be composed by fewer or the same number of
elements than the union (e.g. "OR"). In our ontology a
more restricted (e.g. "AND") concept is more probable to
be STRICTLY included in a grouping concept. This allows
the grouping of WHO-ART concepts using the SNOMED
CT concepts as grouping criteria.
In our model, we have used only the relations "has find-
ing site" and "has associated morphology" which are both
extracted from SNOMED CT. The other SNOMED CT
associative relations (e.g. "has_onset", etc.) are not of any
interest at this time in our model. For each WHO-ART
concept a formal definition is automatically generated as
follows:
Cwho complete
(is_syn some (Csnmctor Csnmctor ....))
or (has_finding_site some (Csnmctand Csnmctand ....))
or (has_associated_morphology some (Csnmctand Csnmctand
....))
In the previous definition, Cwho is a WHO-ART concept
and Csnmct is a SNOMED CT concept.
For example, the formal definition [10] of "Gastritis" and
"Gastritis acute" is:
Gastritis complete
(is_syn some (SNMCT:Gastritis))
or (has_finding_site some (SNMCT: Stomach_structure))
or (has_associated_morphology some (SNMCT:Inflamma-
tion))
Gastritis acute complete
(is_syn some (SNMCT:Acute_Gastritis))
or (has_finding_site some (SNMCT:Stomach_structure))
or (has_associated_morphology
some (SNMCT:Acute_Inflammation))
Given the fact that the "Gastritis acute" is subsumed by
"Gastritis" and "Inflammation acute" is subsumed by
"inflammation" in SNOMED CT, the reasoning process
will classify WHO-ART corresponding terms "Gastritis
acute" as a subclass of "Gastritis".
Querying the model
Making queries on the presented model raises the prob-
lem of managing missing data, precisely missing role fill-
ers.

In this work, we are filling our model with automatically
extracted information and we assume that the formal def-
initions are not complete. By choosing this way to write
the formal definitions we are taking full profit from the
open world assumption (OWA). Roughly speaking, we
are telling to the inference engine that the defined concept
has the properties we are asserting but also that it can have
any other property. In OWA, this notion is expressed by
"nothing" meaning that the logical value (i.e. "true" or
"false") is unknown and being equivalent with the empty
set in the set theory. The empty set will be subsumed by
any class. In a closed world system anything unknown to
the system gets the value "false".
For example, the "obesity" term has no fillers for the rela-
tions "has morphology" and "has localisation". The rea-
soner will assume "nothing" as filler.
In our context, a restriction to "anything" (owl:thing) is
given by default each time a WHO-ART concept does not
have a filler for a relationship. In other words, any restric-
tion on the relationship is removed and we are asserting
that the object is somewhere in the model.
Following this principle, the query class that subsumes
(and therefore groups) all digestive inflammations will be
defined as (Figure 2):
Digestive inflammations
(is_syn some (owl:thing))
or (has_finding_site some (SNMCT:Digestive_structure))
or (has_associated_morphology some (SNMCT:Inflamma-
tion))
In the above definition, the query "Digestive inflamma-
tions" is synonymous with owl:thing It does not mean that
the "Digestive inflammations" class subsumes (in terms
of mathematical set theory: includes) all the classes in the
ontology. In fact, it will subsume the concepts synony-
mous to owl:thing located in some kind of digestive struc-
ture and which has some kind of inflammation as their
associated morphology.
To illustrate this point, we can easily find a class defined
as synonymous to something, which would have an asso-
ciated inflammatory morphology but which would not be
located in a digestive structure (e.g. "Vasculitis"). It is
obvious that this class will not be included in "Digestive
inflammations", but in another defined clustering con-
cept. If we do not systematically define the missing fillers
as owl:thing, this will lead to false situations.
For instance, without a value for "has finding site" and
"has associated morphology", "Obesity" would be sub-
sumed by "Digestive inflammations".

Results
Using the technique presented in the previous sections,
85.9% (1,597) of WHO-ART terms were successfully
mapped through UMLS to one or more SNOMED CT syn-
onyms.
The ontology contains 8,454 classes including 1,597
defined classes involving 4,482 existential assertions. The
primitive concepts hierarchy represents 1.9% of SNOMED
CT (366,170 concepts). It takes an average time of 4 min-
utes for RacerPro [11] to classify this ontology.
The resulting WHO-ART structure is evaluated against the
SSCs built by MedDRA (7.1) editors [12] (available
through UMLS). For evaluation purposes, the MedDRA
SSCs are restricted to the terms that are also in the WHO-
ART terminology. These restricted SSCs will be further
referred to as MedDRA SSC.
In order to illustrate the results of our method, we focus
here on the results concerning the "Hemorrhage" SSC as
an example of grouping class based on associative rela-
tions. The automatic grouping relying only on the synon-
ymy based ontology is missing in many WHO-ART terms.
Indeed, for this SSC there is no higher class grouping in
SNOMED CT, therefore we define a query as:
Hemorrhage_related
(is_syn some (owl:thing))
or (has_finding_site some (owl:thing))
or (has_associated_morphology some (SNMCT:Hemor-
rhage)).
We obtain a class containing 46 of the 55 WHO-ART con-
cepts mapped to corresponding MedDRA Hemorrhage
SSC concepts, 3 are not mapped (14% of WHO-ART terms
are not mapped to SNOMED CT) and the remaining 6 are
concepts for which the relation to "Hemorrhage" is not in
SNOMED CT.
There are 66 WHO-ART terms regrouped in this class. The
false positives include terms like "Duodenal ulcer hemor-
rhagic and perforated", "Colitis hemorrhagic", "Purpura"
or "Hemorrhage in pregnancy" that are in different forms
in the original MedDRA SSC's and that were not mapped
correctly as they have different lexical forms in the original
MedDRA SSCs.
The "Hemorrhage" example shows a preliminary valida-
tion of the method. In the same way, we plan to create
other query classes as long as they can be characterized
using the primitive grouping concepts and associative
relations.
Discussion
Cimino argued that terminologies should comply with
desiderata such as formal definitions and polyhierarchy
[13]. This paper presents a method to transform the
WHO-ART terminology from a classification system with
no formal inference to a knowledge based nomenclature
enabled with inference capabilities. Moreover, it presents
an incremental method able to improve and make evolve
the model.
This is achieved by reusing an existent resource [14] rather
than building the ontology from scratch. The method
benefits from the fact that SNOMED CT embeds in its
hierarchy different semantic views of each term and pro-
vides detailed definitions for each of its terms. Our main
achievement is that we obtain meaningful groups of terms
using automated classification; the relevance of these
groups is compared to the manually built SSCs.
Based on the hierarchy of SNOMED CT only, we had
obtained relevant grouping compared with SSCs [3]. Yet
the automatically generated SSCs based on associative
relations had been incomplete. Our hypothesis for the
present work has been that this limitation can be
improved by adding previously ignored knowledge from
SNOMED CT. The main issue was the addition of this
knowledge in the model.
The 85.9% success of the mapping step is still insufficient
but could be naturally improved since the UMLS Metath-
esaurus is reviewed and updated regularly. To improve
this percentage independently of the review frequency of
the UMLS, we consider investigating approximate match-
ing by browsing other terminologies in UMLS. In further
work NLP techniques will be considered also.
The mappings provided by UMLS present some limita-
tions; terms can be considered synonymous although they
reside on different axes in SNOMED CT (e.g. "Thrombo-
sis", a "Qualifier value" and "Thrombotic disorders", a
"Clinical finding").
The synonym-based method was successful for the SSCs
that have corresponding classes in SNOMED CT (e.g.
"Pain" mapped to "Disorder characterized by pain"). The
presented method improved the results for the other SSCs
such as "Haemorrhage", where the groupings rely more
on associative relations than on "is_a" relations.

The resulting terminological resource can be considered
an evolving one as it allows queries that could give feed-
back on synonymous and associative relationships. For
example, for "Menorrhagia" that has not been found in
the "Hemorrhage related" class one can easily add "Hem-
orrhage" as object for the "has associated morphology"
relation.
Conclusion
UMLS already interconnect medical terminologies and
allows performing transcoding and mappings between
almost all of the medical terminologies actually in use.
The internal organisation, more precisely the rapports that
the authors establishes between the concepts in all these
terminologies meets the most frequent statistical data
analyses needs. As some of these data aggregation require-
ments are common between different medical fields, the
queries (i.e. term groupings) can be performed not only
by using the coding terminology but also the terminolo-
gies related to the one used to code data. This strategy is
greatly helped by UMLS that allows in a very simple way
to transcode data.
In this work, we showed that SNOMED CT terminological
structure can be used to perform automated groupings in
WHO-ART. This work proves that groupings already
present in the MedDRA SSCs (e.g. the haemorrhage SSC)
may be retrieved using classification in SNOMED CT.
Further work will test the assumption that SNOMED CT
can increase the chances to find earlier drug safety signals
from case reports differently coded but reporting on a
same medical issue. Moreover, this technique can be very
useful to refine a terminology structure, to audit it and
propose improvements like for example add terms for
concepts that are not represented or detect incoherence.
