Abstract: Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are challenging to treat, given
the advanced median age and comorbidities of the population. For most patients, the standard
therapy is supportive care, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, red blood cell/platelet transfu-
sions, and growth factors. Decitabine, a hypomethylating agent that allows for the re-expression
of tumor suppressor genes, represents an exciting new treatment option for MDS patients. In
phase 2 and 3 studies, decitabine has been associated with durable responses in MDS patients
and delayed time to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation or death compared with
supportive care. Decitabine has been shown to be well tolerated with a toxicity proﬁle expected
for this class of agent. Recent studies also suggest that lower dose schedules of decitabine
may result in additional improvements in response. As more is learned about the mechanism
of hypomethylating agents, new roles are emerging for decitabine in combination therapy for
MDS and in other hematologic malignancies such as AML.

Myelodysplastic syndromes
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of bone marrow disorders characterized
by ineffective hematopoiesis resulting in anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia
(American Cancer Society 2005; Myelodysplastic Syndromes Foundation 2006;
American Cancer Society 2006). MDS can be classiﬁed as de novo, arising from
no apparent cause, or as secondary, resulting from exposure to a mutagen such as
chemotherapy or benzene (American Cancer Society 2005; Aplastic Anemia & MDS
International Foundation 2005). Chromosomal abnormalities are common in both types
of MDS (Kurzrock 2002; List et al 2004; American Cancer Society 2005; American
Cancer Society 2006). In patients with de novo MDS, chromosomal abnormalities
have been reported in approximately 40%–70% of cases, whereas in patients with
secondary MDS, chromosomal abnormalities are observed in almost 95% of cases
(List et al 2004). MDS occurs primarily in the elderly and is rare in young adults
(Williamson et al 1994; Aul et al 1998; American Cancer Society 2005; American
Cancer Society 2006).
Although the exact number of MDS cases is unknown owing to the lack of a central
United States registry, it is estimated that, in the general population, MDS occurs in
5 per 100,000 people (National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2006). Estimates
range between 10,000 and 20,000 new cases of MDS per year in the United States
(American Cancer Society 2005; Aplastic Anemia & MDS International Foundation
2005). The number of MDS cases is believed to be increasing as a result of the aging
population and the increased survival rate of patients who have received chemotherapy
(American Cancer Society 2005).

The greatest risk factor for MDS appears to be advanc-
ing age, with 80%–90% of all patients over 60 years old
(American Cancer Society 2005). Other risk factors for
MDS are previous chemotherapy, exposure to environ-
mental toxins, tobacco and cigarette smoke, congenital
disorders, familial disorders, and being of male gender
(American Cancer Society 2005). Clinical symptoms may
include fatigue, weakness, and serious infections; however,
approximately half of MDS patients are asymptomatic at
the time of initial diagnosis and are diagnosed only after
routine laboratory tests show abnormalities (Hofmann and
Koefﬂer 2005; American Cancer Society 2005; Aplastic
Anemia & MDS International Foundation 2005). Although
MDS can eventually result in neutropenia and/or throm-
bocytopenia, anemia is the most common characteristic
at the time of initial diagnosis. In the early course of the
disease, a hemoglobin value of less than 10 g/dL has been
observed in approximately 80% of patients (Hofmann and
Koefﬂer 2005).
Prognosis can depend on many variables, including mor-
phology, number of cytopenias, blast count, and cytogenetics.
Left untreated, the median survival ranges from 0.4 years
for high-risk MDS patients to 5.7 years for low-risk MDS
patients (Greenberg et al 1997). In the majority of MDS
patients, death typically results from complications of bone
marrow failure, such as chronic anemia, infections, or severe
bleeding (Kurzrock 2002; Myelodysplastic Syndromes
Foundation and Bennett 2006). Approximately one-third
of adult MDS patients progress to acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), with a median survival of 6–12 months (Ganser and
Hoelzer 1992; Greenberg et al 1997).
Classiﬁcation systems
At the present time there are two MDS classification sys-
tems that have been used to determine expected median
survival and median time to AML transformation. The
French-American-British (FAB) Co-operative Group
Classification recognizes five subgroups of MDS based
on cell morphology and the percentage of blasts (Bennett
et al 1982). In order to improve the prognostic value, the
World Health Organization (WHO) subsequently made
modifications to FAB that included the reduction of the
blast threshold for the diagnosis of AML and refinements
of the categories of refractory anemia (RA) and refrac-
tory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (Vardiman
et al 2002).
There has also been the development of a widely used
prognostication tool, the International Prognostic Scoring
System (IPSS), which takes into account cytogenetics and
number of cytopenias as well as morphology (Greenberg et al
1997; Kurzrock 2002). The IPSS scoring system subdivides
MDS into four distinct subgroups for predicting survival
and risk of transformation to AML (Table 1) (Greenberg
et al 1997).

Decitabine in myelodysplastic syndromes
Clinical practice guidelines
Evidence-based treatment guidelines for MDS have recently
been published by the Italian Society of Hematology, the
United Kingdom, and the United States (National Compre-
hensive Cancer Network [NCCN]) (Alessandrino et al 2002;
Bowen et al 2003; National Comprehensive Cancer Network.
2006). According to these guidelines, the treatment strategy
for MDS should be determined by IPSS risk category, as well
as age and performance status. The recently updated NCCN
guidelines recommend hypomethylating agents, such as
decitabine or azacitidine, for the treatment of higher risk MDS
patients and for lower risk MDS patients who are nonrespon-
sive to growth factor therapy or who are HLA-DR15 negative
(National Comprehensive Cancer Network. 2006).
Treatment options
The MDS patient population presents many challenges when
considering an appropriate treatment strategy, including
advanced age, comorbidities, and an inability to tolerate
certain types of intensive therapy. Therapy should be selected
based on the patient’s performance status, disease classiﬁca-
tion, IPSS score, and treatment tolerance. In patients with a
low-risk or intermediate-1 IPSS score, the goals of therapy
are to improve blood counts and ensure age-related quality
of life (National Comprehensive Cancer Network. 2006),
whereas for intermediate-2 and high-risk patients, the goals of
therapy are to prolong survival and delay leukemic progres-
sion (National Comprehensive Cancer Network. 2006). The
only potentially curative treatment for MDS is hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT), however, this option is
available for only a small number of patients (ie, younger
age, histocompatible donor, no signiﬁcant comorbidities)
(Alessandrino et al 2002; Bowen et al 2003; National Com-
prehensive Cancer Network. 2006). Some high-risk MDS
patients who are not candidates for HSCT may be eligible
for intensive antileukemic chemotherapy (Alessandrino et al
2002; Bowen et al 2003; National Comprehensive Cancer
Network. 2006). Nevertheless, the vast majority of MDS
patients are managed with supportive care, including red
blood cell (RBC)/platelet transfusions, growth factors such
as recombinant erythropoietin and colony-stimulating fac-
tors, and antibiotics, including broad coverage in neutropenic
patients as infection occurs.
A number of emerging therapeutic options are currently
being evaluated for the treatment of MDS that will, it is hoped,
add to the treatment options for patients who are ineligible
to receive HSCT or intensive chemotherapy. Lenalidomide,
an immunomodulatory drug derived from thalidomide, has
been recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and is indicated for the treatment of MDS in patients
with chromosome 5q deletion. Other agents such as imatinib
and tipifarnib are currently being evaluated in clinical trials
(Cortes et al 2003; Feldman 2005; Sekeres 2005; Jabbour
and Giles 2005). Some of the therapies farthest along in
development are the hypomethylating agents decitabine and
azacitidine, both of which have been recently approved by
the FDA for the treatment of MDS.
Hypermethylation in cancer
DNA methylation is a common epigenetic modiﬁcation that
plays an important role in gene expression in mammalian
cells (Leone et al 2002; Das and Singal 2004). As part of
normal development, certain genes may be silenced through
methylation of cytosine residues in their promotor regions
(CpG islands). However, in some hematopoietic neoplasms
including MDS, DNA hypermethylation can inactivate genes
essential for the control of normal cell growth, differentia-
tion, or apoptosis. A group of enzymes called DNA methyl-
transferases (DNMTs) catalyze the methylation of cytosine
residues in newly synthesized DNA, thus replicating the
methylation signal. In recent years, there has been interest
in pharmacologic therapies that target this mechanism by
inhibiting DNMT, resulting in hypomethylation of the DNA
and re-expression of tumor suppressor genes. Cytosine ana-
logues such as decitabine have been shown to inhibit DNMT
and are being used against MDS, as well as AML and other
cancers (Leone et al 2002; Das and Singal 2004).
Multiple genes appear to be hypermethylated in MDS,
including p15INK4B
, which encodes a cell-cycle inhibitor.
Evidence suggests that p15INK4B
methylation is corre-
lated with blastic bone marrow involvement and that it
increases during disease progression to AML (Quesnel
et al 1998; Quesnel and Fenaux 1999). Methylation of
the p15INK4B
gene may allow leukemic cells to escape the
inhibitory signals in the bone marrow (Quesnel et al 1998;
Quesnel and Fenaux 1999). Decitabine treatment has been
shown to reverse hypermethylation of p15INK4B
, allowing
for re-establishment of normal p15INK4B
protein expres-
sion (Daskalakis et al 2002). In addition, hypomethyl-
ation of p15INK4B
has been associated with hematologic
response, supporting pharmacologic demethylation as a
possible mechanism for clinical response (Daskalakis
et al 2002).
Decitabine is believed to have a dual mechanism
of action depending on dose. At both lower and higher
doses, decitabine incorporates into DNA; however, at
Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management 2007:3(5)810
Saba
higher doses, decitabine inhibits cell proliferation through
nonreversible covalent linking with DNA methyltransfer-
ase and blocking of DNA synthesis (Leone et al 2002). At
lower doses, decitabine induces hypomethylation, thereby
promoting cell differentiation, re-expression of tumor
suppressor genes, stimulation of immune mechanisms,
and suppression of tumor growth (Leone et al 2002;
Mund et al 2005).
Description and structure
of decitabine
Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is a cytosine analogue
modiﬁed in position 5 of the pyrimidine ring (Figure 1).
Decitabine is slightly soluble in ethanol/water (50/50),
methanol/water (50/50), and methanol; sparingly soluble in
water; and soluble in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Decitabine
(Dacogen™ for Injection) is a white to almost-white sterile
lyophilized powder supplied in a clear, colorless glass vial
(Dacogen 2006).
Pharmacokinetics
Decitabine distributes extensively throughout human
tissues. In a phase 1 pharmacokinetic study of decitabine
in 21 patients with advanced solid tumors, the mean value
of volume of distribution was found to be 4.59 L/kg ± 1.42
(van Groeningen et al 1986). Although the exact route of
elimination and metabolic fate of decitabine is unknown in
humans, high total body clearance values and a total urinary
excretion of less than 1% of the administered dose suggest
that decitabine is eliminated rapidly and primarily through
enzymatic metabolism (van Groeningen et al 1986).
In a more recent pharmacokinetic phase 1 study, 16
patients with MDS/AML were administered decitabine at a
dose of 15 mg/m2
as a 3-hour infusion every 8 hours for 3
consecutive days of a 6-week cycle for two cycles (Cashen
et al 2005). Preliminary results suggest that repeated adminis-
tration of decitabine does not result in systemic accumulation
of the drug. For the ﬁve patients who received decitabine
for two cycles, maximum concentration (Cmax

Cycle1 (49.0 ± 22.2 ng/mL) and Cycle 2 (62.7 ± 45.2 ng/mL)
were comparable, suggesting that decitabine pharmacokinet-
ics remain unchanged from cycle to cycle.
Clinical studies of decitabine
Phase 2 studies of decitabine in MDS patients yielded encour-
aging response rates, including overall responses (complete
response [CR] + partial response [PR]) of 26%–45% and
complete responses of 21%–28% (Wijermans et al 1997;
Wijermans et al 2000; Saba et al 2005; Saba and Wijermans
2005). These results led to a North American, multicenter
phase 3 study of decitabine compared with supportive care
in 170 MDS patients, which formed the basis for the FDA
approval of decitabine (Saba et al 2004; Kantarjian et al
2006). Patients were stratiﬁed by IPSS risk group and type
of MDS (de novo or secondary) and randomly assigned to
receive either supportive care alone or decitabine at a dose
of 15 mg/m2
as a 3-hour infusion every 8 hours for 3 days,
repeated every 6 weeks, plus supportive care. Primary end-
points were overall response rate (ORR) and time to AML
transformation or death. Responses were assessed using the
International Working Group (IWG) criteria (Cheson et al
2000), which deﬁned a CR as normalization of peripheral
counts and bone marrow for at least 8 weeks with serial bone
marrow blasts less than 5% without dysplastic changes, hemo-
globin greater than 11 g/dL, a neutrophil count 1.5 × 109
/L
or greater, and a platelet count of 100 × 109
/L or greater. A
PR was deﬁned similarly to CR except for the reduction of
Ն50% of blasts that remained above 5%, or a downgrade in
the FAB criteria. Response criteria had to be met for at least
8 weeks. The study design dictated that patients be removed
from therapy after two cycles of a maintained CR.
The results of the phase 3 study indicate that decitabine
is clinically effective in patients with MDS. Patient baseline
characteristics were well balanced between the two study
arms. Responses were deﬁned according to strict IWG cri-
teria (Cheson 2000). The ORR of patients in the decitabine
arm was 17% compared with 0% in the supportive care only
arm (p Ͻ 0.001) (Table 2). In decitabine-treated patients
considered evaluable for response (ie, those patients with
pathologically conﬁrmed MDS at baseline who received at
least two cycles of treatment), the ORR was 21% (12/56)
(McKeage and Croom 2006). Responses were observed
across all IPSS risk groups and were found to be durable,
with a median duration of response of 10.3 months (Table 2).
Median time to ﬁrst response (PR or CR) was 3.3 months
(Table 2). Hematologic improvement (HI) was observed in
an additional 13% of patients in the decitabine group versus
7% in the supportive care arm. The overall improvement
rate for patients receiving decitabine was 30% versus 7% for
patients receiving supportive care. Patients in the decitabine
arm had a median time to AML or death that was 4.3 months
greater than that of patients in the supportive care only arm
(p = 0.16) (Figure 2A). When patient subgroups were ana-
lyzed, patients receiving decitabine experienced a longer
time to AML or death than patients receiving supportive
care only (treatment-naïve [12.3 vs 7.3 months; p = 0.08]
[Figure 2B], IPSS risk of intermediate-2/high-risk patients
[12.0 vs 6.8 months; p = 0.03] [Figure 2C], IPSS high-risk
patients [9.3 vs 2.8 months; p = 0.01], or de novo MDS [12.6
vs 9.4 months; p = 0.04]).
All responders in the phase 3 study, deﬁned as patients
achieving a CR or PR, became RBC and platelet transfusion
independent in the absence of growth factors during the time
of the response (Saba et al 2004; Saba and Wijermans 2005;
Kantarjian et al 2006). The percentage of patients in the
decitabine arm who became RBC transfusion independent
increased with increased number of treatment cycles, while
the percentage of patients on supportive care who required
RBC transfusions did not change (Figure 3). All eight

responders who had cytogenetic abnormalities at baseline
and were evaluable for cytogenetic response achieved a
cytogenetic response (seven major responses and one minor
response). The median number of cycles delivered was three,
with 43 of 89 patients receiving two or more cycles. Of the
15 patients who responded after decitabine treatment, the
median number of courses was six. In contrast, the median
number of cycles in the phase 2 studies was four, which may
in part explain the slightly higher response rates in the phase
2 studies (Saba et al 2005). The authors of the phase 3 study
speculate that greater beneﬁt may have been observed if
the study design had allowed patients to continue receiving
decitabine therapy for a longer period of time.
Safety data were evaluated for 83 patients treated with
decitabine and 81 patients who received supportive care only.
Overall, decitabine therapy was well tolerated with man-
ageable adverse effects. The most common adverse effects
included myelosuppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia,
and anemia), pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, cough, petechiae,
diarrhea, and constipation (Table 3). Febrile neutropenia
occurred in 28% of patients who received decitabine. The
authors noted that neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia,
and leukopenia appeared to diminish in incidence over the
ﬁrst four cycles of decitabine treatment; however, these tox-
icities remained frequent, most likely owing to the continuing
presence of underlying disease and myelosuppression.
Decitabine has also been studied in MDS patients with
disease recurrence who had previously responded to the
drug. Rüter and colleagues reported recently on 22 patients
who received decitabine retreatment at the time of disease
relapse (Lubbert et al 2004; Ruter et al 2006). These patients
had initially received a median of six courses of decitabine
(range 2–6 courses), which resulted in a CR in 55% (12
of 22 patients), a PR in 27% (6 of 22), and a hematologic
improvement in 18% (4 of 22). Decitabine retreatment was
initiated at a median of 11 months after the last course of
initial treatment. In the retreatment stage, patients received a
median of three courses, resulting in 45% (10 of 22 patients)
of patients responding (7 HI, 2 PR, and 1 CR). The median
duration of second response was 4 months. Because the

Decitabine in myelodysplastic syndromes
quality and duration of the second response were inferior to
those of the ﬁrst response, the authors suggest that decitabine
responders may derive more clinical beneﬁt from a longer
period of initial treatment.
Optimal dosing of decitabine
As previously described, decitabine is believed to have a dual
mechanism of action depending on dose, with higher doses
associated with cytotoxicity and lower doses associated with
demethylation. Because of this dose-dependent mechanism
of action, lower-dose schedules of decitabine may be safer
and more effective than higher dose schedules. Indeed, early
studies of decitabine using high doses of the drug showed
activity in various types of hematologic malignancies but
with signiﬁcant prolonged myelosuppression (Santini et al
2001). In a more recent study, decitabine appeared signiﬁ-
cantly more active at lower doses compared with higher doses
(Issa et al 2004).
In order to further optimize therapy with decitabine,
Kantarjian and colleagues performed a randomized study of
three low-dose schedules in patients with MDS and chronic
myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (O’Brien et al 2005;
Kantarjian et al 2005; Kantarjian et al 2007). The decitabine
dose per course was reduced from the FDA approved dose of
135 mg/m2
to 100 mg/m2
. In addition, the doses of decitabine
were delivered every 4 weeks (rather than every 6–8 weeks),
as long as there was persistent disease and no signiﬁcant
myelosuppression-associated complications, and therapy
was continued for at least three courses before response
was evaluated. The three dosing schedules were as follows:
20 mg/m2
intravenously (IV) over 1 hour daily for 5 days
(arm A), 10 mg/m2
IV over 1 hour daily for 10 days (arm
B), and 10 mg/m2
subcutaneously (SQ) given twice daily
for 5 days (arm C).
The results of the study by Kantarjian and colleagues
indicate that lower dose schedules of decitabine have higher
efﬁcacy in MDS patients (O’Brien et al 2005; Kantarjian
et al 2005; Kantarjian et al 2007). At least one course of
therapy was received by 95 patients. Response criteria for
CR and PR were the same as for AML (PR also requiring a
decrease in blasts by >50%) but required response durability
for at least 4 weeks. In total, 32 patients had a CR (34%),
1 patient had a PR (1%), 23 patients (24%) had marrow CR
without (n = 10, 11%) or with other HI responses (n = 13,
14%), and 13 patients had an HI (14%). When analyzed by
schedule, the complete response rates were 39% for arm A,

24% for arm B, and 21% for arm C (Table 4). The median
number of courses to reach CR for all treatment groups was
three (range, 1–7). Myelosuppression was the primary toxic-
ity reported and it occurred more with arm B (Table 4). In
summary, the schedule of 20 mg/m2
IV over 1 hour daily for
5 days was found to be superior to the other two regimens
and to offer an excellent therapeutic option in addition to the
FDA approved dose (Table 5).
Approved indications for decitabine
Decitabine is approved for the treatment of patients with
MDS, including previously treated or untreated, de novo or
secondary MDS of all FAB subtypes (RA, RARS, RAEB,
RAEB-T, and CMMoL) and intermediate-1, intermediate-2,
and high-risk IPSS groups (Dacogen [package insert] 2006).
Decitabine dosing for MDS is 15 mg/m2
via a 3-hour continu-
ous infusion three times a day for 3 days for the ﬁrst treat-
ment cycle, repeated every 6 weeks. It is recommended that
patients be treated for a minimum of four cycles; however, it
is noted that a complete or partial response may take longer
than four cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the
patient continues to beneﬁt. Patients may be premedicated
with standard antiemetic therapy.
Decitabine treatment is associated with myelosuppres-
sion, so complete blood counts are recommended before each
cycle of therapy, or as needed to assess toxicity (Dacogen
2006). After the ﬁrst cycle of therapy, dose adjustments
and delays may be required and are outlined in the package
labeling. Clinicians should consider the early administration
of growth factors and/or antimicrobial agents for prevention
or treatment of infections. Myelosuppression and worsening
neutropenia may occur more frequently in the ﬁrst or second
treatment cycles, and may not necessarily indicate progres-
sion of underlying MDS. Decitabine is contraindicated in
patients with a known hypersensitivity to decitabine and
carries a pregnancy category D rating.
Preparation and stability
Decitabine should be aseptically reconstituted with 10 mL
of Sterile Water for Injection (USP) (Dacogen 2006).
Immediately after reconstitution, the solution should be
further diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection, 5%
dextrose injection, or lactated Ringer’s injection to a ﬁnal
drug concentration of 0.1–1.0 mg/mL. Unless used within
15 minutes of reconstitution, the diluted solution must be
prepared using cold (2 °C–8 °C) infusion ﬂuids and stored
at 2 °C–8 °C (36 °F–46 °F) for up to a maximum of 7 hours
until administration.
Azacitidine
Azacitidine is the only other approved hypomethylating
agent for the treatment of MDS. Although similar in struc-
ture to decitabine, azacitidine contains ribose rather than
deoxribose and is incorporated primarily into RNA and to a
much lesser extent into DNA. This difference may account
for the approximately 10-fold higher potency of decitabine
compared with azacitidine (Creusot et al 1982).
In a randomized phase 3 trial of azacitidine in patients
with MDS, azacitidine produced results similar to decitabine,
with an ORR (CR + PR) in the azacitidine arm of 16.2%
compared to 0% in the supportive care arm (p Ͻ 0.0001)
(Silverman et al 2002; Kaminskas et al 2005). The CR rate
in patients treated with azacitidine was 6.1% compared with
0% for patients treated with supportive care. Median time to
AML or death was signiﬁcantly increased with azacitidine
treatment (21 months compared with 13 months for sup-
portive care). As expected for this class of agent, the most
common treatment-related toxicity was myelosuppression.
Because of the lack of any head-to-head trials, it is
difﬁcult to compare the efﬁcacy of decitabine and azacitidine.

Decitabine in myelodysplastic syndromes
3 trials add to this difﬁculty. Patients in the phase 3 azacitidine
study were able to stay on treatment longer, resulting in
a median of nine treatment cycles (Silverman et al 2002),
compared with those in the phase 3 decitabine trial who
received a median of three treatment cycles (Kantarjian et al
2006). The median duration of MDS was 7.3 months in the
decitabine study compared with 2.8 months in the azacitidine
trial, suggesting that the decitabine patients had more aggres-
sive disease (Silverman et al 2002; Kantarjian et al 2006). In
addition, response criteria in the azacitidine trial were less
rigorous, requiring a CR or PR for at least 4 weeks and not
requiring disappearance of dysplastic changes (Silverman et al
2002), compared with the decitabine study in which response
was determined using IWG criteria (Kantarjian et al 2006).
Future considerations
Clinical studies are now under way to evaluate combination
therapy with decitabine and other agents. Farthest along in
development is the combination of decitabine and histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors such as valproic acid. Results
from a recent phase 1/2 study of decitabine and valproic
acid suggest that this combination has signiﬁcant activity
in patients with AML and MDS and is associated with
changes in histone acetylation and DNA hypomethylation
(Garcia-Manero et al 2006). Other agents that are being
studied in combination with decitabine include amsacrine,
idarubicin, daunorubicin, topotecan, cisplatin, carboplatin, and
imatinib (Plumb et al 2000; Garcia-Manero and Gore 2005).
Decitabine therapy, alone and in combination with other
agents, has shown encouraging results in other studies
involving AML patients (Rivard et al 1981; Momparler et al
1985; Pinto et al 1989; Petti et al 1993; Lubbert et al 2005).
Preliminary results from a recent phase 2 study in AML
patients not eligible for induction chemotherapy suggest
that decitabine is an active ﬁrst-line treatment (Lubbert et al
2005). Decitabine was administered at a dose of 135 mg/m2
IV over 72 hours repeated every 6 weeks for up to four
courses, with all-transretinoic acid (ATRA) administered at
a dose of 45 mg/m2
per day for 28 days during the second
course in decitabine-sensitive patients. In the 29 fully evalu-
able patients, a CR was observed in four patients (14%) and
a PR was observed in ﬁve patients (17%). Toxicities with
decitabine were similar to those described for MDS, and no
unexpected toxicities were observed with the combination
of decitabine plus ATRA.
Although not within the scope of this review, decitabine
is also being evaluated in chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML) (Sacchi et al 1999; Kantarjian et al 2003; Issa et al
2005) and in some solid tumors including renal, ovarian,
colorectal, and cervical cancer (van Groeningen et al 1986;
Abele et al 1987; Sessa et al 1990; Clavel et al 1992;
Momparler et al 1997; Thibault et al 1998; Schwartsmann
et al 2000; Plumb et al 2000; Samlowski et al 2005; Stewart
et al 2005; Gollob et al 2006).
Summary
Results from phase 2 and phase 3 studies indicate that
decitabine is effective in the treatment of MDS, resulting

in durable clinical responses and delayed time to AML
transformation or death.
Decitabine has been shown to be well tolerated, with
a toxicity proﬁle expected for this class of agents. Recent
studies suggest that the efﬁcacy of decitabine may be fur-
ther optimized by allowing for multiple treatment cycles
and by using lower-dose schedules such as a schedule of
20 mg/m2
IV over 1 hour daily for 5 days. Future directions
for decitabine include its use in combination therapy with
agents such as HDAC inhibitors and in AML.
