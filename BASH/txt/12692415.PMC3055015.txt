We conducted a retrospective study to investigate the incidence, risk factors, and
clinical features of hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) following allogeneic hematopoietic
cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Adult patients who developed HC after allo-HCT
were identified from the HCT database of the Asan Medical Center and their me-
dical records were reviewed. From December 1993 to August 2001, a total of 210
adult patients underwent allo-HCT. Fifty-one patients developed HC with a cumu-
lative incidence of 25.7%. The median onset of HC was post-transplant day 24
(range, -2 to 474), and the median duration was 31 days (range, 8 to 369). Signifi-
cant risk factors for HC by univariate analysis included diagnosis of chronic myel-
ogenous leukemia (p=0.028), unrelated HCT (p=0.029), grade III-IV acute graft-
versus-host disease (GVHD) (p<0.001), extensive chronic GVHD (p=0.001),
and positive cytomegalovirus antigenemia between post transplant days 31 and
60 (p=0.031). Multivariate analysis showed that grade III-IV acute GVHD was
the most important risk factor for the occurrence of HC after allo-HCT (odds ratio,
3.38; 95% CI, 1.36-8.39). Late-onset HC, which occurred beyond 3 weeks after
allo-HCT, was more frequently associated with GVHD than early-onset HC (p=0.007).
Our data suggest that a portion of late-onset HC might be a manifestation of GVHD.

INTRODUCTION
Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is an important cause of mor-
bidity following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).
The incidence of HC after HCT has been reported to range
from 7% to 76% (1-5). It has varied according to the defi-
nition of hemorrhagic cystitis, conditioning regimens, type
of HCT, and regimen of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
prophylaxis. Most cases of HC occurring after HCT are self-
limited, but they can cause pain, debilitation, and prolonged
hospitalization. Occasionally life-threatening hemorrhage is
encountered. The diagnosis of HC is usually made on clini-
cal grounds when hematuria occurs in the absence of urinary
tract bacterial infection or other causes of hematuria. Hyper-
hydration and chemoprotectant 2-mercaptoethane sodium
sulfonate (mesna) have been commonly used to prevent HC
after HCT (5, 6)
HC can occur at any time following HCT. HC in the early
post-transplant period is usually associated with thrombocy-
topenia, busulfan (1, 7), or cyclophosphamide (5, 6). Patho-
genesis of delayed presentation of hemorrhagic cystitis, occur-
ring weeks to months post-transplant, is less clearly under-
stood, but viruses such as BK virus (4, 8-11), adenovirus 11 (3,
12), or cytomegalovirus (CMV) (13, 14) and GVHD (15-
17) have been found to be risk factors. In allogeneic HCT
setting, the role of GVHD in HC is a subject of debate. HC
may occur from direct viral injury or as a result of the blad-
der epithelium acting as a target organ for GVHD.
We conducted a retrospective study to investigate the inci-
dence, risk factors, and clinical features of HC following allo-
geneic HCT.

/day for 5 days and
melphalan 100 mg/m2
/day for 1 day) for non-myeloablative
conditioning. For patients who received cyclophosphamide as
a part of conditioning regimen, hyperhydration and mesna
were given. Four doses of mesna 12 mg/kg were administered
intravenously on each day of cyclophosphamide administra-
tion. All blood products were leukocyte-depleted by filtration
and irradiated prior to transfusion. Intravenous immunoglob-
ulin 500 mg/kg was administered at day -7, then every other
week until day 120, and monthly until day 180. All patients
received cyclosporine with or without methotrexate for the
prophylaxis of GVHD. For the prevention of veno-occlusive
disease (VOD), heparin was administered to those patients
who received BuCy regimen at a rate of 100 units/kg/day from
day -7 to day 30. Heparin was discontinued if there was clini-
cally significant bleeding or the PTT exceeded 1.2 times the
upper limit of control. Bone marrow (day 0) or G-CSF mobi-
lized peripheral blood stem cells (days 0 and 1) from the donors
were infused over 3-4 hr. Recombinant human granulocyte-
colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) 300 or 450 g was given
intravenously once daily starting on day 0 or day 5.
Definition of Hemorrhagic Cystitis
HC was defined as the presence of sustained microscopic or
macroscopic hematuria for 7 days or more from the beginning
of conditioning therapy in the absence of other clinical con-
ditions such as menstruation, bleeding due to other gyneco-
logic problem, disseminated intravascular coagulation, mul-
tiple organ dysfunction syndrome or sepsis. HC was clinical-
ly graded as follows: grade 1, microscopic hematura; grade 2,
macroscopic hematuria; grade 3, macroscopic hematuria with
small blood clots; grade 4, massive macroscopic hematuria
requiring instrumentation for clot evacuation and/or causing
urinary retention. HC was classified into early (cases occurring
within post-transplant day 21) or late (cases occurring after
post transplant day 21) onset.
Statistical analysis
Cumulative incidence of HC from the initiation of condi-
tioning therapy was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier met-
hod, censoring at last follow-up, death, relapse, graft failure,
or performance of donor lymphocyte infusion. Clinical risk
factors were analyzed for their effect on the occurrence of hem-
orrhagic cystitis. Differences between groups were compared
by log-rank test. Variables with p-value less than 0.05 by uni-
variate analysis were considered for entry into Cox proportion-
al hazard model.
Differences in categorical variables between patients with
early-onset HC and those with late-onset HC were tested using
the chi-square test, whereas continuous variables were com-
pared using the Mann-Whitney U test.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
From December 1993 to August 2001, a total of 210 pa-
tients, 107 males and 93 females, underwent allogeneic HCT
in the Asan Medical Center. The median age of the patients
was 32 yr (range, 15 to 59). The indications for HCT were
acute myelogenous leukemia in 65 patients, acute lymphoblas-
tic leukemia in 32, acute mixed leukemia in 5, chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) in 40, myelodysplastic syndr-
ome in 12, aplastic anemia in 27, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
in 9, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in 5, solid tumor
in 9, and miscellaneous in 6. Stem cell donors were siblings
in 166 patients and unrelated volunteers in 44. Stem cell grafts
were bone marrow in 179 patients and G-CSF mobilized pe-
ripheral blood in 31. Conditioning regimens were BuCy in
150 patients, BuCy plus cytarabine or etoposide in 3, Cy-ATG
in 27, Bu-Fludara-ATG in 28, and FM in 2. For the prophy-
laxis of GVHD, 162 patients received cyclosporine plus me-
thotrexate and 48 received cyclosporine only.
Clinical features of HC
Of the 210 patients in the study, 51 developed HC with
a cumulative incidence of 25.7%. The median onset of HC
was post-transplant day 24 (range, day -2 to 474). In 24 pa-
tients, the onset of HC was within post-transplant day 21 (ear-
ly onset) and in 27, the onset was later than post-transplant
day 21 (late onset). The median duration of HC was 31 days
(range, 8 to 369 days). Clinical grade of HC was as follows:
grade I in 19 patients, grade II in 19, grade III in 9, and grade
IV in 4. The symptoms and signs of HC were urinary frequen-
cy in 27 patients (53%), tenesmus in 23 (45%), dysuria in 11
(22%), urgency in 6 (12%), azotemia in 5 (10%), and urinary
obstruction in 3 (6%). Fourteen patients (28%) required blad-
der catheterization with irrigation and 3 (6%) intravesical in-
stillation of alum. One patient with grade IV HC died of un-
controlled bleeding due to severe hemorrhagic cystitis. In an-
other patient with grade IV, HC developed on post transplant
day 35, and lasted for 369 days with intermittent urinary ob-
struction and azotemia. Although HC resolved eventually,
severe urinary stricture was found on day 457 by retrograde
urethrography and urethral dilatation was performed on day
461. In the remaining 2 patients with grade IV HC, HC per-
sisted until they died of disease progression and GVHD,
respectively.

Risk factors for hemorrhagic cystitis
Table 1 illustrates cumulative incidence of HC according
to clinical characteristics. Significant risk factors for HC by
univariate analysis included diagnosis of CML (p=0.028),
unrelated donor HCT (p=0.029), acute GVHD of grade III
to IV (p<0.001), extensive chronic GVHD (p=0.001), and
positive CMV antigenemia between post-transplant day 31
and 60 (p=0.031). These risk factors were entered into Cox
proportional hazard model (Table 2). Multivariate analysis
showed that grade III to IV acute GVHD was the most impor-
tant risk factor for the occurrence of HC after allogeneic HCT
(odds ratio, 3.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.36-8.39; Fig. 1).

early-onset HC (until post transplant day 21) and 26 (51%)
had late-onset HC (after post-transplant day 21) (Table 3).
Clinical grade and duration of HC were not significantly dif-
ferent between the two groups. Platelet count and coagula-
tion times at the onset of HC were also similar between the
two groups. A higher proportion of patients with late-onset
HC had GVHD at the onset of HC than those with early-
onset HC (p=0.007).
DISCUSSION
HC following HCT is multifactorial in origin and the po-
tential causes included chemical toxins, radiation, viruses,
immunologic mechanism, and idiopathic etiologies (5, 6). Cy-
clophosphamide, which is used frequently as a part of most
conditioning regimens, is a well-defined etiology of hemor-
rhagic cystitis. Acrolein, a urinary metabolite of cyclophos-
phamide, is thought to be responsible for the urothelial tox-
icity (18). Although hyperhydration and use of mesna have
decreased the incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis, cyclophos-
phamide may still be a major cause of early-onset HC after
HCT. Urinary excretion of viruses such as BK virus (4, 8-11),
adenovirus 11 (3, 12), or CMV (13, 14) has been reported
to be strongly associated with HC after HCT. The virus most
frequently implicated is the BK virus. Arthur et al. (8) sug-
gested that reactivation of BK virus might account for a sub-
stantial proportion of late-onset, long-lasting HC in HCT
recipients. Bedi et al. (4) showed that HC occurred in half
of the patients with persistent BK viruria and in none of the
patients without excretion of BK virus. Leung et al. (9) de-
monstrated that BK viruria was quantitatively related to the
occurrence of HC after HCT. They also observed that BK vir-
uria was detected in 2 of 5 patients with pre-engraftment HC
and in 21 of 27 patients with post-engraftment hemorrhag-
ic cystitis (17). They suggested that BK virus might be in-
volved in the pathogenesis of both early and late onset hem-
orrhagic cystitis. We did not examine urinary excretion of
BK virus or adenovirus. Five of 10 patients, in whom urine
CMV cultures were performed at the onset of hemorrhagic
cystitis, had CMV viruria.
The role of GVHD in the pathogenesis of HC remains un-
clear. HC may occur as a result of uroepithelium acting as a
target organ for GVHD rather than from direct viral injury,
while the immunosuppressive state associated with GVHD
may also increase the reactivation of virus. Arthur et al. (8)
observed a higher incidence of HC in the recipients of allo-
geneic HCT compared to those of autologous HCT. GVHD
has been reported to be a risk factor for HC after allogeneic
HCT in several studies. Ost et al. (15) observed that 20 of

125 recipients of allogeneic HCT developed late-onset HC
and there was a correlation between the severity of HC and
severity of acute GVHD. They suggested that bladder epithe-
lium might be a target for GVHD, although the typical mo-
nonuclear inflammatory infiltrates were not seen on biopsy
or at autopsy. Ruutu et al. (19) also argued that severe late-
onset HC might in itself be a manifestation of chronic GVHD.
Leung et al. (17) suggested that attack of urothelium by im-
mune cells, possibly directed against BK viral antigens, might
play a pathogenetic role. However, Sencer et al. (3) did not
find GVHD to be significantly associated with HC in their
large series. Bedi et al. (4) failed to show that the frequency
of HC was related to occurrence of acute or chronic GVHD.
We investigated the risk factors for HC in the patients who
underwent allogeneic HCT. Acute GVHD of grade III to IV
was the only independent risk factor for HC by multivariate
analysis. Late-onset hemorrhagic cystitis, which was defined
as HC occurring beyond 3 weeks after HCT, were more fre-
quently associated with GVHD than early-onset hemorrhag-
ic cystitis. Our data suggest that a portion of late-onset HC
might be a manifestation of GVHD.
