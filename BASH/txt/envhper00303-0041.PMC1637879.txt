The Role of Epidemiology in the Detection of Harmful Effects of Radiation

Data relating to acute injuries ofatomic bomb survivors show that the life span study cohort is
biased in favor of exceptionally low levels of radiosensitity. These data also show that factors
influencing the death rates of this cohort include irreversible damage to the immune system.
These impresions are still awaiting confirmation. Meanwhile, the Oxford Survey of Childhood
Cancers and surveys of nuclear workers show that at low dose levels the cancer risk is much
greater than estimnates based on atomic bomb survivors; the special association between leukemia
and radiation is an exclusively high dose effect, and levels ofradiosensitivity are much lower in
the middle of the life span than at either extreme. Key words: competing causes of death,
immune system dysfunction, late effects of radiation. Environ Health Perspect 108:93-96

There is widespread agreement among
nuclear scientists that the best method for
estimating cancer effects ofionizing radiation
is linear extrapolation ofthe high dose effects
observed in atomic bomb survivors, and that
the risk is much greater for leukemia than for
other neoplasms. As a result ofthis consensus,
the cancer risk coefficients in the Biological
Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) V (1)
and the International Commission on
Radiological Protection (ICRP) 60 (2) are
based on atomic bomb data. These docu-
ments are also based on methods of risk
analysis which assume that there is no inter-
ference from cell death effects of radiation
even in cases where a high dose exposure was
followed by a short-lived leukocytosis and
prolonged loss of immunologic competence
(3) (Figure 1).
In a lengthy follow-up of atomic bomb
survivors, there is no mention ofthese exclu-
sively high dose effects (4). However, the
leukocytosis could easily have left the marrow
component of the reticuloendothelial system
(RES) with an exceptionally large number of
mutant stem cells. Therefore, there is a dear
need to compare atomic bomb data with data
from exclusively low dose situations. Two
sets of atomic bomb data are especially suit-
able for this purpose. The first describes the
cohort that was assembled from census data 5
years after the bombing of Nagasaki and
Hiroshima in 1945 [life span study (LSS
cohort)], and the second describes the sub-
jects in several studies of teratogenic and
carcinogenic effects of fetal irradiation (in
utero cohort) (4). Two other data sets are also
useful: one describes the first survey to find
evidence of a cancer risk at low dose levels
[the Oxford Survey of Childhood Cancers
(OSCC) data] (5) and the other describes the
first survey of nuclear workers to find evi-
dence ofa cancer risk at supposedly safe dose
levels (Hanford [Washington] data) (6).
LSS Cohort
The official ICRP position regarding the late
effects ofthe atomic bomb radiation is large-
ly the result of continuous mortality surveil-
lance ofthe LSS cohort and repeatedly arriv-
ing at the same condusions. First, there are
no late effects of the radiation apart from
cancer; second, there is no cancer risk at the
dose levels likely to be encountered by
nuclear workers; third, there is a greater risk
of leukemia than of solid tumors (with rela-
tively short intervals between exposure and
death for the leukemia cases); and fourth,
there are higher levels of radiosensitivity
toward the beginning rather than the end of
adult life (4).
On the strength of these findings it is
widely assumed that atomic bomb survivors,
apart from their radiation dose, are represen-
tative human beings and, consequently, that
the levels ofradiosensitivity are the same not
only for survivors and nonsurvivors, but also
for survivors with and without acute injuries.
For example, in BEIR V (1), where cancer
risk coefficients are based on 75,991 mem-
bers of the LSS cohort, there is no mention
ofthe fact that RES damage evoked different
reactions from lymph node and red marrow
(Figure 1), or the fact that a few survivors
from a massive epidemic of acute RES dam-
age were still showing signs of faulty
leukopoiesis as late as 1956 (i!.
After census identification of persons
who were still alive on 1 October 1950,
exposure positions, shielding, flash burns
and three types of cell death effects, namely
oropharyngeal lesions, purpura, and epila-
tion were systematically recorded (8). The
exposure positions and shielding informa-
tion were needed for dose estimation, and
epilation claimants were included both in
laboratory studies of RES damage (4) and in
a statistical analysis which showed that for
1,308 claimants the dose-response curve for
leukemia was exceptionally steep (9).
However, as a result of the Jablon et al. (10)
1965 decision that inaccurate recording of
acute injuries had rendered the acute injury
data useless (10), there was no further men-
tion ofthe burns or the cell death effects in a
series of mortality reports by the Radiation
Effects Research Foundation (RERF;
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan) and its
former organization, the Atomic Bomb
Casualty Commission (ABCC).
For several decades after the 1945 bomb-
ing of Japan, the only distinctive effect of
RES damage (aplastic anemia) remained a
relatively common and dose-related cause of
death (11). However, the LSS death rate for
diseases of blood and blood-forming tissues
was higher than normal; Beebe et al. (12)
regarded this as part of the special relation-
ship between leukemia and radiation. They
also ignored a suggestion by Stewart (13)
that the normal noncancer death rate of the
LSS cohort might be an artifact. According
to the Stewart (13) hypothesis, the extra
deaths before 1950 left the LSS cohort
biased in favor of exceptionally healthy per-
sons, although it was not obvious because
deaths from incomplete repair ofRES damage
continued long after 1950. By regarding this
as an untestable hypothesis-but neverthe-
less allowing the general release of a limited
amount ofLSS data in the form of LSS Data
on Disk (14)-the RERF made it possible
for Stewart and Kneale (15,16) to discover
that for all causes ofdeath except cancer and
cardiovascular diseases, the LSS death rate
was negatively correlated with dose below
the threshold for excessive marrow damage
and positively correlated with dose above
this level (Figure 2) (15). Among the sur-
vivors whose doses exceeded 1 Gy, there
were few persons who were younger than 10
years of age or over 50 years of age when
exposed (Figure 3) (16).
These observations made it appropriate
to take a closer look at the injury data. The
RERF added to LSS Data on Disk (14) the
records needed to distinguish between 2,601
survivors who claimed at least two acute
injuries; 63,072 survivors who denied all
four injuries; and a residual group consisting

Stewart and Kneale (17) that support the
following conclusions: for the cohort as a
whole and for the survivors who denied all
four injuries, there was no evidence of any
late effects of the radiation apart from can-
cer; in addition, levels of radiosensitivity
were higher before 30 years ofage than after.
In the small group of survivors who claimed
multiple injuries, cancer was not the only
cause of extra (dose-related) deaths, and lev-
els of radiosensitivity were higher for the
youngest and oldest ofsix exposure ages than
for any ofthe intervening age groups (Figure
4). Stewart and Kneale (17) also included
tests of cohort homogeneity which showed
that for several causes of death (including
cancer), there were significant differences
between the survivors who claimed multiple
injuries and the other survivors. They also
included figures which showed that it was
only in the small group of survivors who
claimed multiple injuries that the proportion
of leukemias among the cancer deaths was
higher than normal (Table 1).
OSCC Data
The survey that first found evidence of a
cancer risk at low dose levels did so by com-
paring each dead child in a nationwide sam-
ple of early cancer deaths with a live child
from the same regional birth cohort (5).
When these comparisons showed that the
dead children had been more often X-rayed
before birth than the live children, new tar-
gets were set, and the Oxford survey (5)
gradually became an important source of
information under various headings includ-
ing cancer effects of fetal irradiation and the
etiology ofchildhood cancers (18).
The new targets necessitated a long-
period ofdata collection that eventually pro-
duced both interview data for a long series of
case-control pairs (with supplementary data
from family doctors, antenatal clinics, and
X-ray departments) and regional data for
each 10-km square of the national grid (19).
The latter included annual numbers of live
births, stillbirths, and infant deaths
(1943-1974); independent measurements of
background radiation doses (supplied by the
National Radiological Protection Board,
Aldermaston, England); annual numbers of
cancer deaths of children younger than 16
years of age (1953-1979); and interview
data for most of these cases and their
matched controls (who were now represent-
ing all members ofthe regional birth cohorts
with cancer cases).
Several conclusions have been made
from numerous comparisons between the
OSCC cases and their matched controls.
First, the usual time to perform X rays on
pregnant women (the third trimester) is later
than the usual time to initiate a childhood
cancer (the first trimester) and, after these
early low-dose exposures, the risk is no
greater for leukemia than for other neoplasms
(20,21). Second, the cancer risk is much
greater for first- as compared to third-tri-
mester exposures (22); even during the less
dangerous period, however, a dose of 10 mSv
might be sufficient to double the normal risk
of an early cancer death (20). Third, in addi-
tion to the X-ray data, there is also evidence
that during the latent phase of all childhood
cancers (especially leukemia) there is mount-
ing sensitivity to infections (23), and evi-
dence that in countries with high rates of
infant mortality this effect of the cancer
process is the cause ofa strong negative corre-
lation between early deaths (0-4 years ofage)
ascribed to leukemia and pneumonia (24),
Study evidence from comparisons
between different parts of Britain shows that
childhood cancers have a naturally clustered
distribution, with higher death rates in rural
areas than in large cities; the causes of child-
hood cancers include in utero exposure to
background radiation as well as prenatal
X rays; and factors that affect the number of
early cancer deaths include both pregnancy
illnesses and postnatal infections (19). There
is still no explanation why the worldwide
increase in childhood leukemias that fol-
lowed the discovery of sulphonamides (and
had nothing to do with obstetric radiogra-
phy) was solely the result of lymphatic cases
(25). It is possible that this unique feature of
childhood leukemias is the result of myeloid
and lymphatic leukemias with fetal origins
that do not have the same competing causes
ofdeath (18,26).
According to this hypothesis, mutations
during embryogenesis have teratogenic as
well as carcinogenic effects. However,
although mutations in lymphatic compo-
nents of the RES cause faulty maturation of
immunoglobulins and lymphatic leukemia,
mutations in myeloid components cause
faulty maturation of hemoglobin and
myeloid leukemia. Infections are competing
causes of death for both types of leukemia,
but in myeloid leukemia cases, intolerance of
low oxygen pressures (from faulty erythro-
poiesis) may lead either to a stillbirth during
the second stage of labor or to a sudden
death during the shallow breathing of deep
sleep. Several observations support these the-
ories. In children with myeloid leukemia and
in cases of the sudden infant death syn-
drome, there are exceptionally high levels of
fetal hemoglobin and other signs of faulty
erythropoiesis (27,28). In children with
Down syndrome and other congenital diseases
where there is faulty maturation of the
immune system, there is an exceptionally high
risk of dying from lymphatic leukemia that
only became obvious after antibiotics were

discovered (18). In addition, childhood can-
cers are only common in tissues that are not
essential for in utero survival, e.g., the brain.
The Oxford survey (5) provided evi-
dence that after exposure to a small dose of
radiation the cancer risk is the same for
leukemia and solid tumors. The survey also
provided evidence that childhood cancers
are the result of mutations which have ter-
atogenic as well as carcinogenic effects, and
that infections are competing causes of
death for cancers of the immune system,
including leukemia, lymphoma, and myelo-
ma. As a result of these associations, only
populations with low rates of mortality
show common incidences of leukemia, and
the relationship between age and cancer
mortality has been the same for leukemia
and other neoplasms only since the discov-
ery ofantibiotics (29).
In Utero Cohort
Studies of 1,500 persons who survived in
utero exposures to atomic bomb radiation
provided several impressions: there were no
teratogenic effects of the radiation apart
from microcephaly; there was no risk of
microcephaly after exposures before 8 weeks
of fetal age (4); there was no equivalent of
the OSCC findings for prenatal X rays (1);
and there were no childhood leukemia cases
among 14 cancers that presented before 40
years of age and there were only four male
cases (30). For the in utero cohort there is
no equivalent of LSS Data on Disk (14).
From various publications, however, it is
possible to deduce that there is gross under-
representation of exposures in the in utero
cohort before 8 weeks offetal age (16). This
deficit is probably the result of the young
embryo's exceptional sensitivity to the lethal
effects of radiation, which leaves the sur-
vivors of the abortions so caused even more
strongly biased in favor of exceptionally low
levels of radiosensitivity than those in the
LSS cohort. Evidence of this bias includes
the low sex ratio for the 14 cancer cases
(males are more abortion prone than
females) and the total absence of any child-
hood leukemias (deaths from the devas-
tating effects of the blast probably killed all
of the preleukemic children). Finally,
although there was a long period when the
findings for atomic bomb survivors were
regarded as a reason to doubt the validity of
OSCC data, it is now generally recognized
that the OSCC data are a reliable source of
information about the cancer effects of fetal
irradiation (31). The position on occupa-
tional exposures to radiation is less certain
(32), although even here there is a strong
impression ofa cancer risk at dose levels that
showed no signs of a cancer risk in atomic
bomb data.
Hanford Data
The use ofa maximum permissible dose and
compulsory requirements for nuclear work-
ers to wear radiation badges have ensured
that the U.S. nuclear establishment is rea-
sonably certain that routine work in nuclear
facilities will not be a cause ofoccupationally
induced cancers (6). This assumption was
originally based on atomic bomb data and
was also supported by Gilbert and Marks
(32), who discovered that the total number
of cancer deaths of Hanford workers was
small by national standards; they found no
evidence of any extra dose-related cancers.
Meanwhile, the original survey of Hanford
workers by Mancuso et al. (33) conveyed
some very different impressions.
According to Mancuso et al. (33), the rel-
atively low cancer death rate was the result of
selective recruitment of exceptionally healthy
persons into the nuclear industry. However,
Kneale and Stewart (34), the second report,
included an analysis which showed that, pro-
vided each annual dose of each worker is
allowed, there is a separate contribution to the
total risk. Therefore, it is possible to detect a
cancer risk at dose levels only a fraction higher
than background radiation, and it is possible
to show that this is largely the result ofexpo-
sures after 50 years of age. Furthermore, as
with OSCC data (5), the extra cancer deaths
of Hanford workers in the Kneale et al. (34)
study showed no signs of any special asso-
ciation between leukemia and radiation.
In 1996, a World Health Organization
survey (35), which allowed pooling of data
from seven cohorts of nuclear workers in
three countries, found no evidence of a can-
cer risk at low dose levels and consequently
conduded that atomic bomb data are a reli-
able source of cancer risk coefficients (35).
Meanwhile, the inclusion of workers from
two of the seven cohorts (Hanford and Oak
Ridge, TN) by Kneale and Stewart (34)
revealed significantly different standards
of dose estimation in the two facilities.
Independent studies of Oak Ridge and
Rocketdyne (Santa Susana, CA) workers also
found evidence ofa cancer risk at supposedly
safe dose levels and discovered that this was
largely the result of exposures after .50 years
ofage (36,37).
Conclusions
There are now three analyses of LSS data
with findings that are difficult to reconcile
with common assumptions about atomic
bomb survivors and the late effects of radia-
tion. These analyses include a 1991 analysis
by Neriishi et al. (9), which showed that the
dose-response curve for leukemia was excep-
tionally steep for 1,308 survivors whose
injury claims included epilation; a 1992
analysis by Shimizu et al. (38), which found

an excess of noncancer deaths among sur-
vivors with high doses; and the 1998 analysis
by Stewart and Kneale (17). According to
these analyses, the LSS cohort is not a homo-
geneous population, and this heterogeneity is
probably the result of high doses that cause
irreversible damage to the RES and that have
immune system effects which were felt by
survivors as well as nonsurvivors.
There are a few studies ofnuclear workers
that failed to find any evidence of a cancer
risk at low dose levels (32,35). However, there
are increasing numbers ofstudies whose find-
ings are indicative of a cancer risk at sup-
posedly safe dose levels. According to these
surveys the risk at low dose levels is no greater
for leukemia than for other neoplasms, and
because it increases progressively with age,
exposures after 50 years of age are especially
dangerous (34,36,37). Together with OSCC
data for in utero exposures, these findings are
compatible with much higher levels of radio-
sensitivity at the beginning and end of the
life span than during the intervening years
(Figure 5). Because this is also true ofsensitiv-
ity to infections, we can be reasonably certain
that there is strong immune system control of
mutant cells as well as by foreign organisms.
Other findings of the OSCC (5) and the
in utero cohort of atomic bomb survivors
indude evidence ofearly loss ofimmunologic
competence in all childhood cancers, especial-
ly leukemia, and strong competition between
teratogenic and carcinogenic effects of early
mutations. Therefore, factors that influence
the frequency of childhood cancers include
not only infections (and antibiotics) but also

Various sources of epidemiologic data
have provided findings which make it rea-
sonable to assume that the LSS cohort is not
only biased in favor of exceptionally low
levels of radiosensitivity but also includes
examples of persons who have sustained
irreversible damage to the immune system.
As a result ofthese biases, atomic bomb data
are not a reliable source ofcancer risk coeffi-
cients, but they can still be used to study
factors with immune system associations.
