Background. H-Y antigen incompatibility adversely impacts bone marrow transplants however, the relevance of these antigens in
kidney transplantation is uncertain. Three previous retrospective studies of kidney transplant databases have produced conﬂicting
results. Methods. This study analyzed the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database between 1997 and 2009
using male deceased donor kidney transplant pairs in which the recipient genders were discordant. Death censored graft survival
at six months, ﬁve, and ten years, treated acute rejection at six months and one year, and rates of graft failure by cause were the
primary endpoints analyzed. Results. Death censored graft survival at six months was signiﬁcantly worse for female recipients.
Analysis of the causes of graft failure at six months revealed that the diﬀerence in death censored graft survival was due primarily
to nonimmunologic graft failures. The adjusted and unadjusted death censored graft survivals at ﬁve and ten years were similar
between the two genders as were the rates of immunologic graft failure. No diﬀerence in the rates of treated acute rejection at
six months and one year was seen between the two genders. Conclusions. Male donor to female recipient discordance had no
discernable eﬀect on immunologically mediated kidney graft outcomes in the era of modern immunosuppression.
1. Introduction
Identifying candidate minor histocompatibility antigens that
impact outcomes after transplantation is diﬃcult, and anti-
gens that have been identiﬁed often have disparate eﬀects
depending on the organ or tissue transplanted. One minor
histocompatibility antigen system that has been identiﬁed is
the H-Y antigen system. The H-Y antigen system is produced
by a series of genes found on the Y chromosome of males
which produce proteins with distinct amino acid sequences
from their X chromosome homologs and have signiﬁcant
tissue expression. Seven genes have been identiﬁed on the
Y chromosome that posses these characteristics, and these
antigens constitute the H-Y antigen system [1–4]. Organs or
tissues from males transplanted into females are potentially
exposed to these “nonself” antigens which could produce an
alloimmune response. The impact of the H-Y antigen system
has been best demonstrated in bone marrow transplants
where it has been shown that male bone marrow transplant
recipients of marrow transplants from female donors have
a higher rate of graft versus host disease, while female
recipients of male bone marrow have a higher rate of graft
failure than male to male or female to female bone marrow
transplants [5–11].
The evidence for an eﬀect of the H-Y antigen system
in renal transplantation is less certain. The expression of
these antigens on the surface of human kidney tissue is not
well studied, so it is not clear if target H-Y alloantigens
are expressed on kidney tissue. Antibody formation to H-
Y antigens has been demonstrated, and in one small study
female recipients of male kidneys who had detectable anti-
bodies to H-Y antigens had a higher rate of acute rejection
[12]. Registry studies of kidney transplants examining the
eﬀect of gender mismatching on outcomes have shown
conﬂicting results. A study of human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) identical living donor kidney transplants showed no
2 Journal of Transplantation
eﬀect of gender matching on graft survival [13]. A study from
an international collaborative transplant registry from 45
countries showed a small but statistically signiﬁcant poorer
death censored graft survival at one and ten years among
female recipients of male donor kidneys when compared
to all other gender combinations [14]. Finally, an analysis
of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network
(OPTN) database showed a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence
in death censored graft survival at one year but no diﬀerence
thereafter [15]. The last two studies used death censored graft
survival as a surrogate endpoint for immunologic failure
of the graft and used regression analysis to adjust for the
diﬀerences in the donor and recipient populations, and none
of the studies examined acute rejection as an endpoint.
Since donor quality is an important factor determining
both short- and long-term outcomes in kidney transplan-
tation, and the covariates used in modeling do not always
capture all the diﬀerences, a paired cohort analysis of the
OPTN database was undertaken in order to better analyze
the impact of the donor recipient gender discordance on
kidney transplant outcomes. Because death censored graft
failure as an endpoint includes graft failures due to both
immunologic and nonimmunologic causes, this paired study
includes a more detailed analysis of the causes of graft failure
and also an analysis of rejection rates reported to the registry.
The primary graft outcomes analyzed were death censored
graft survival at six months, ﬁve years, and ten years, treated
acute rejection rate at six months and one year, and rates of
graft failure at six months and from six months onward by
putative etiology coded in the database.
2. Patients and Methods
All male deceased donor kidneys from January 1, 1997 to
November 27, 2009 in whom the recipient of each pair of
kidneys was discordant for recipient gender, were selected
from the OPTN database [16]. Only recipient pairs of
solitary kidney transplants were included. Pairs in whom one
recipient received a multiorgan transplant were excluded.
Also pairs in whom survival data was absent on one or both
cases were also excluded. Grafts whose cause of failure was
primary nonfunction were included in the analysis. No other
variables were used to exclude candidates. The donor pair
study design was chosen because it controls for donor quality
within each pair. This era of transplantation was chosen
because the use of the combination of a calcineurin inhibitor
and mycophenolic acid type antimetabolites (i.e., modern
maintenance immunosuppression) was high. The primary
graft outcomes analyzed were death censored graft survival
at six months, ﬁve years and ten years, treated acute rejection
rate at six months and one year, and rates of graft failure at
six months and from six months onward by putative etiology
coded in the database.
The etiology of graft failure was determined from two
data ﬁelds. One was the numerically coded cause of graft
failure which included the following categories: hyperacute
rejection, acute rejection, primary nonfunction, thrombo-
sis, infection, surgical complication, urologic complication,
recurrent disease, chronic rejection, or other. The second
ﬁeld used was a write-in ﬁeld. For those graft failures
coded as other, the write-in ﬁeld was queried, and based
on the documentation two additional causes were included:
noncompliance and polyoma-virus-associated nephropathy.
Write-in causes of graft failure not included in the list
were coded as other. Also, if the query matched one of
the numerically coded groups, the cause of graft loss was
changed to that category. Graft losses without coding in
either ﬁeld were considered unknown. Recipients who died
during followup and whose graft survival time was equal to
their patient survival time were classiﬁed as death with graft
function.
Cox proportional hazard ratio survival analysis was
carried out to determine the independent association of graft
failure with donor recipient gender match (male to male and
male to female). The following covariates were included in
the model : recipient age, race/ethnicity (Caucasian, African
American, Hispanic, and other), and body mass index
(BMI), donor: recipient cytomegalovirus (CMV) serologic
status (D+/R−, D+/R+, D−/R+, D−/R−, or unknown)
delayed graft function (DGF) (deﬁned as dialysis in the
ﬁrst week after transplant), duration of dialysis prior to
transplant, history of previous transplant, cold ischemia
time, human leukocyte antigen mismatch, type of induction
(lymphocyte depletion, Interleukin-2 receptor blocker, or
other/none), maintenance immunosuppression at discharge,
and panel reactive antibodies (PRA).
Statistical signiﬁcance for categorical variables was deter-
mined using the Pearson’s chi-squared test and Fisher’s
exact test. ANOVA testing was used to determine statistical
signiﬁcance between scalar variables. Log rank testing was
performed to determine statistical signiﬁcance for Kaplan
Meier survival analysis. Cox analysis included correlation due
to the match pairs using the robust sandwich estimate of the
covariance matrix specifying the linked recipient-donor pairs
[17]. A probability of type 1 error (alpha) = 0.05 two sided
was considered to be the threshold of statistical signiﬁcance.
With the exception of the Cox analysis using the robust
sandwich estimate of covariance matrix which required the
use of Spotﬁre S + 8.1 (TIBCO Inc., Palo Alto, CA), statistical
analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 17.0 for
Windows, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill, USA).
3. Results
Between January 1, 1997 and November 27, 2009, 12,479
male donors were identiﬁed in which both kidneys were
transplanted as single kidney transplants in two recipients
who were discordant for gender. The characteristics of
the pairs are shown in Table 1. Female recipients were
slightly younger and more likely to be of minority race
or ethnicity, preemptively transplanted, have a PRA greater
than 79%, receive lymphocyte depleting agent for induction,
and be on tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid derivative
for maintenance immunosuppression. Male recipients were
more likely to have diabetes mellitus or hypertension as
a cause of ESRD, a high-risk CMV serology combination

Figure 1 shows the Kaplan Meier death censored graft
survival in the ﬁrst 180 days after transplant based on gender
match. Female recipients of male donors had signiﬁcantly
worse death censored graft failure at 180 days after transplant
(log rank P = 0.013). The survival curves show that the
decrement in survival occurs in the ﬁrst 30 days. The slopes
of the curves after 30 days are nearly identical. Adjusting
for the diﬀerences in the two populations, female recipients
of male kidney had a statistically signiﬁcant worse outcome
when compared to their paired male recipient (Hazard Ratio
1.28 95% C.I. 1.12–1.46).
Table 2 shows the frequency of graft failure by cause in
the ﬁrst 180 days after transplant. Although hyperacute graft
failures were more common in female recipients than male
recipients, the main cause of the diﬀerence in graft failures
seen among female recipients was a higher incidence of graft
thrombosis and other speciﬁed nonimmunologic causes
of graft failure. Since graft failure can be multifactorial,
contributory factors were queried for in the dataset. Only 189
cases out of the 1003 cases of graft loss in the ﬁrst 180 days
had a contributory factor listed in the dataset. Considering
all immunologic causes both primary and contributory did
not change the results of the analysis of graft failures.

recipients of male kidneys at both time points.

respectively. The rates of graft loss due to acute and chronic
rejection were not diﬀerent between the two recipient
genders.
4. Discussion
This analysis suggests that the male donor to female recipient
gender discordance does not have a signiﬁcant impact
on immunologic graft outcomes in the current era of
immunosuppression. Our analysis is consistent with the

ﬁnding from the previous analysis of the OPTN database
by Kim and Gill that short-term graft outcomes were worse
among female recipients of male kidneys when compared
to male recipients while the long-term graft outcomes were
not. Our analysis goes further to show that the diﬀerence in
short-term outcomes occurs very early after transplant and is
driven not by immunologically mediated graft failures but by
a higher rate of graft thrombosis and graft failure due to other
nonimmunologic causes. Similarly, our analysis did not show
a diﬀerence in the rates in early acute rejection or late graft
6 Journal of Transplantation
failures due to acute or chronic rejection consistent with the
conclusion that for the vast majority of female recipients of
male kidneys receiving modern immunosuppression the H-Y
antigen incompatibility did not increase the risk of rejection
or graft failure.
The strength of this study is that it better controls for
donor quality and assessed not only death censored graft
survival but also the rates of rejection and graft failure by
cause. The study has a number of caveats regarding the
conclusions. First, the study is limited by the accuracy of
the registry data regarding the coding of the cause of graft
failure and episodes of rejection. Over 95% of case did have
a speciﬁed code for cause of graft failure, and the number of
cases coded as unknown was similar between the two groups.
Determining causality of graft failure can be diﬃcult and
depends on medical sophistication of the person entering
the data. That being said, there is no reason to believe that
the gender of the recipient would bias the presumptive cause
of graft failure entered even if the cause of graft failure was
incorrect. Second, 28% and 35% of cases, respectively, lacked
coding for treated acute rejection at six months and one year.
For each time point, the percentage of missing data for acute
rejection was similar between the two genders. Although the
rates of rejection were similar in the patients in whom coding
was present, it is possible that the rejection rates could be
diﬀerent if the missing data were present, and as a result
the strength of the conclusion from the acute rejection data
must be interpreted in that context. On the other hand, the
data from the acute rejection rates is concordant with the
ﬁndings regarding the rate of immunologic graft loss in this
population.
This study also demonstrates the shortcomings of using
death censored graft failure as a surrogate marker for
immunologic failure of the graft. Short-term diﬀerences in
outcomes previously demonstrated in the analysis of the
OPTN database appear by our analysis to be due to nonim-
munologic graft failures, mainly due to vascular thrombosis
and other nonimmunologic causes of renal failure like acute
tubular necrosis due to sepsis. In fact, in the present era of
immunosuppression, early graft failure in the ﬁrst six months
due to rejection is a rare event occurring in approximately
1% of transplants in this analysis. In contrast, death with
functioning graft occurred in approximately 3% of recip-
ients and vascular thrombosis or primary nonfunction in
approximately 1%, respectively. The ﬁnding of a higher rate
of thrombosis among female recipients was unexpected but is
biologically plausible given that estrogen is a prothrombotic
hormone and females are more likely to have conditions such
as antiphospholipid syndrome or lupus erythematous which
are associated coagulation abnormalities that increase the
risk of thrombosis.
Why H-Y incompatibility did not aﬀect outcomes
remains speculative. There are a number of possibilities why
one tissue or organ may be more or less susceptible to
immunologic attack. One potential explanation for the lack
of eﬀect is that H-Y antigen expression on human kidney
tissue is absent or weak. There are no published studies of
H-Y antigen expression on human kidney tissue. Second,
even if the H-Y antigens are expressed on kidneys, the use of
potent immunosuppression may prevent kidney rejection in
the majority of cases limiting its impact on outcomes. Finally,
it is possible that sensitization through previous exposure
to the H-Y antigens by pregnancy or previous transplant
is necessary before an eﬀect would be seen. One study
indicated that the presence of antibodies to H-Y antigens
predicted a higher rate of rejection [12]. In our study, 67%
of female recipients had a potential sensitizing event via
previous organ transplant or pregnancy, the majority being
previous pregnancy. Although the gender of the previous
donors or fetuses was not know, for each female recipient
who had a potential exposure to the H-Y antigens, the
probability of exposure can be determined by one minus
0.5 to the power of the number of exposures where 0.5
represents the probability of being exposed to female fetus
or donor kidney. Knowing the distribution of the number
exposures in the population, one can approximate the overall
exposure in the female population that was studied. In this
study cohort, approximately 52% of the females would be
predicted to have had an exposure either through pregnancy
or previous transplant to H-Y antigens. Obviously, exposure
to an antigen does not always cause sensitization. But this
population did have a signiﬁcant exposure to H-Y antigens,
and no eﬀect was seen suggesting that exposure if it has an
eﬀect is weak. Also, it is possible that pregnancy, as is the
case of HLA sensitization, is a weaker sensitizing event than
exposure through transplantation. Most of the exposures
in our population would have been predicted to be due
to pregnancy rather than previous transplant potentially
attenuating the eﬀect.
In summary, this analysis of the OPTN database indicates
that the male donor to female recipient gender discordance
has minimal if any impact on immunologic kidney graft
outcomes in the modern era of immunosuppression. Female
recipients of male donor kidneys had neither an increased
rates of acute rejection in the ﬁrst year after transplant nor
increased risk of graft failure related to rejection.
