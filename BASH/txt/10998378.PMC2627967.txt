Chryseobacterium meningosepticum, formerly
known as Flavobacterium meningosepticum and
CDC II-a, is a gram-negative rod widely distributed
in nature. The pathogen causes meningitis in
premature and newborn infants (1-3) and
pneumonia, endocarditis, postoperative bacter-
emia, and meningitis usually associated with
severe underlying illness in adults (4-7).
Although C. meningosepticum infections are rare,
accurate diagnosis is important because the
species is usually resistant to multiple antibiot-
ics, especially to those (including extended-
spectrum ß-lactam agents and aminoglycosides)
typically prescribed for treatment of aerobic,
gram-negative bacterial infections. Moreover,
epidemics may occur, and a death rate as high as
55% has been reported in a nursery outbreak (8,9).
Recent studies indicate that the species
C. meningosepticum is highly heterogeneous and
composed of many subgroups, which may be
reclassified as separate species (10,11). Geneti-
cally defined subgroups within C. meningosepti-
cum also differ in their pathogenicity (11). From
September 1996 to March 1999, 17 culture-
documented systemic infections due to a group of
atypical C. meningosepticum strains occurred in
two newborns and 15 immunocompromised
patients in our institution. All isolates, which
were initially misidentified as Aeromonas salmoni-
cida, were resistant to a number of antimicrobial
agents. The isolates were definitively identified
as atypical strains of C. meningosepticum by full
biochemical investigation, 16S rRNA gene
sequence analysis, and cellular fatty acid
analysis. Random amplified polymorphic DNA
fingerprinting (RAPD) studies showed that these
strains are distinct from bacteria of other genera
tested, as well as from C. meningosepticum
isolates from other geographic areas.

From 1996 to 1999, 17 culture-documented systemic infections due to novel,
atypical strains of Chryseobacterium meningosepticum occurred in two newborns and
15 immunocompromised patients in a medical center in Taiwan. All clinical isolates,
which were initially misidentified as Aeromonas salmonicida by an automated bacterial
identification system, were resistant to a number of antimicrobial agents. The isolates
were characterized as atypical strains of C. meningosepticum by complete biochemical
investigation, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, cellular fatty acid analysis, and
random amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting (RAPD). This is the first report of a
cluster of atypically variant strains of C. meningosepticum, which may be an emerging
pathogen in newborns and the immunocompromised.

Research
Methods
Patients and Bacterial Isolates
From September 1996 to March 1999, 17
patients admitted to Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital and Children’s Hospital had clinical
samples positive for A. salmonicida. Primary
cultures from these patients showed pure growth
of nonfastidious, glucose-nonfermenting bacilli
that were oxidase positive and nonmotile. The
isolates were initially identified as A. salmonici-
da (%I.D. = 0.70) by the ID 32 GN Automatic
Identification System (Biomerieux, St. Louis,
MO), software version 3.2.2. Because this
organism is a fish pathogen and has not been
isolated in humans (12), we reviewed the charts
of these patients. Clinical data for age,
immunocompromising diseases, type of infection,
and disease outcome were collected and
analyzed. Infections were considered community
acquired if the patient came to medical attention
acutely ill, with an initial positive culture.
Infections were considered nosocomial if cultures
were negative at the time of admission or if
symptomatic disease developed after the first 72
hours of hospitalization. All 17 isolates were
tested biochemically and identified as C. menin-
gosepticum with atypical reactions. These conven-
tional biochemical tests were incubated at 30°C,
and reactions were recorded after 2 days and 7
days of incubation in ambient air. Interpretation
and identification were based on standard
schema (13).
Clinical isolates from four index cases
(strains 96, 97-1, 97-2, and 97-3) were sent to the
University of Maryland and the University of
Illinois at Chicago Medical Center for confirma-
tion with conventional biochemical methods;
they were again identified as C. meningosepticum.
Broth Microdilution Susceptibility Tests
Broth microdilution MIC tests were per-
formed and interpreted by National Committee
for Clinical Laboratory Standards protocols (14),
including cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth
(Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI). A final
inoculum of 5 ×105 CFU/mL and incubation for 16
to 20 h at 35°C in ambient air were used.
16S rRNA Gene Sequence Analysis
The MicroSeqTM 500 rDNA Bacterial Sequenc-
ing Kit (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was
used to amplify and sequence approximately the
first 500 bp of the 16S rRNA gene, according to
manufacturer’s instructions. DNA sequencing
with dRhodamine-labeled dye-terminators pro-
vided two overlapping strands of sequence data,
with two sequencing primers. The sequence data
were analyzed and assembled with AutoAssem-
bler Software (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Bacterial identification based on 16S rRNA gene
sequence data, generation of the dendogram, and
calculation of the percentage difference or genetic
distance between sequences were performed with
theMicroSeqTM MicrobialIdentificationandAnalysis
Software (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Fatty Acid Analysis
Whole-cell fatty acids were extracted and
analyzed (15). Analysis was performed by using
an automated Hewlett-Packard HP 5890 II
Microbial Identification System (MIDI, Inc.,
Newark, DE). Fatty acid profiles were compared
with a library of cell profiles of clinically relevant
bacteria making up a similarity index.
Random Amplified Polymorphic
DNA Fingerprinting
This polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
assay was performed as described (16). All
bacterial strains were grown on L agar and
incubated at 37°C overnight. Three loops of
bacterial colony were mixed with 250 µL of Tween
20 and TE buffer and incubated at 94°C for 20
min. After addition of 250 µL of chloroform and
centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 4 min, the
supernatant was collected, and the DNA was
quantified by UV absorbance at A260. The primer
sequence used to produce discriminatory finger-
printing profiles of bacterial strains was 5'
GTCGATGTCG 3'. Each RAPD PCR reaction
mixture (25 µL) contained 15 ng of genomic DNA,
40 pmol of oligonucleotides, 1 unit of Taq
polymerase (GIBCO-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD),
250 µL deoxynucleoside triphosphate (Pharma-
cia, Laval, Quebec, Canada), 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH
8.0), 50 mM KCL, 0.001% gelatin, and 3 mM
MgCl2. Each reaction mixture was overlaid with
25 µL of mineral oil and amplified with a Perkin-
Elmer Cetus DNA Thermal Cycler model TC-1
according to the following profile: 4 cycles, each
consisting of 5 min at 94°C, 5 min at 36°C, and 5
min at 72°C; 30 cycles, each consisting of 1 min at
94°C, 1 min at 36°C, and 2 min at 72°C; and a final
extension step at 72°C for 10 min. PCR-amplified
products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel
Vol. 6, No. 5, September–October 2000 Emerging Infectious Diseases483
Research
electrophoresis and, after staining, were visual-
ized and photographed under UV illumination.
RAPD was performed twice on each strain, and
fingerprinting was also analyzed twice. Final
comparison was done by visual analysis, as well
as Molecular Analyst Fingerprinting Plus
Software (Bio-Rad, Ontario, Canada). We also
used RAPD to examine four clinical isolates of
C. meningosepticum, one Klebsiella pneumoniae,
and two Burkholderia cepacia, along with the
Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain P1 (16) as controls.
Results
The first patient was a 3-day-old, full-term
neonate who was transferred to our center for the
treatment of early-onset neonatal sepsis and
meningitis in September 1996. The infections of
this index patient and of another newborn were
presumed to be perinatally acquired, although
culture of the cervix of the mothers was negative
for this organism. Most of the other infected
patients were immunocompromised (Table 1).
Age >60 years and long-term hospital stay also
appear to be risk factors for the infection. All
infected patients <60 years of age had
substantial immunosuppressive underlying dis-
eases (Table 1). Three of the 15 nonneonatal
patients died of the infection; the two newborns
survived, but with severe neurologic sequelae,
despite antibiotic treatment. After the first case
in 1996 and three consecutive infections due to
this unusual organism in early 1997, we initiated
a surveillance system to monitor all infections
caused by the organism in our hospital.
Biochemical properties of the isolates were
nearly identical to those of typical C. meningosep-
ticum (17), except that 8 of the 17 isolates (47%)
were positive for nitrite reduction and none of
them grew on MacConkey agar. Colonies of these
isolates were pale yellow on blood agar plates. All
the isolates were nonmotile and oxidase-positive,
hydrolyzed esculin and gelatin, were positive for
o-nitrophenyl-ß-D-galactopyranoside, and pro-
duced indole. However, as described (17), the
indole reaction was only weakly positive after a
48-h incubation at 30°C, and a more robust
reaction was observed with inoculation into heart
infusion broth rather than tryptophan broth.
The four index strains were also tested with
other automated systems, including the API 20E,
API 20NE, and Vitek GNI+ rapid identification
systems (Biomerieux, St. Louis, MO). On API
20E, all four isolates gave a profile number of
106300400, which was interpreted as an
“unacceptable profile” in the 20E database. On
API 20NE, four different profile numbers were
generated for the four strains (2476305, strain
96; 2476304, strain 97-1; 3476306, strain 97-2;
and 2456304, strain 97-3). Profiles for three of the
four strains were interpreted as “excellent

identification” at 99.9% for C. meningosepticum.
The profile number of 3476306 for strain 97-2 was
interpreted as “doubtful” at 99.1%, but the only
possible choice listed for organism identification
was C. meningosepticum. By using the Vitek
GNI+ card, we generated a profile number of
62022000040 for three of the four isolates, giving
an interpretation of C. meningosepticum at 99%.
Strain 97-2 gave a slightly different profile
number of 60022000040, but with a 97% match
for C. meningosepticum.
An old version of software was installed for
use with the ID 32 GN Automatic Identification
system (Biomerieux, St. Louis, MO) in the
original identification of these isolates; this
software was unable to correctly identify them as
C. meningosepticum. We updated the database
with a newer version 3.6.8 in May 1999. When the
originally misidentified isolates were rerun
through the updated database, C. meningosepti-
cum was the first choice (%I.D. = 1.00), with A.
salmonicida as the second choice (%I.D. = 0.70).
No cases of A. salmonicida infection have been
identified in our laboratory since May 1999.
MIC results for the 17 clinical strains from
Taiwan were determined by the broth microdilu-
tion method (Table 2). All the agents tested
except piperacillin and ciprofloxacin had poor in-
vitro activities against these organisms. Compar-
ative sequence analysis with the MicroSeq
system revealed that the four index isolates
share the same sequence, which clustered most
closely with the type strain of C. meningosepti-
cum (Figure 1); however, the genetic distance of
2.7% suggests that these isolates may represent
either an atypical biovar of C. meningosepticum
or a novel species within the genus (18). Cellular
fatty acid analysis indicated that these isolates
were close to C. meningosepticum, with a similarity
index of 0.94. The major peaks were i-15:0
(38.5%), i-3-OH 17:0 (15.9%), and i-17:1 (7.8%).
Eight RAPD fingerprints were obtained from
the 17 C. meningosepticum isolates, which
differed genetically, based on RAPDs, from the
other four clinical C. meningosepticum strains
from Canadian patients with bacteremia. The
RAPD typing results of the four index isolates,
96, 97-1, 97-2, and 97-3, were compared with
those of other closely related gram-negative
bacteria (Figure 2). Using this typing method, we
identified an apparently conserved 0.4-kb

fragment in the DNA fingerprints of the 17
isolates. This genetic marker was absent from
other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria, such as
Pseudomonas and Burkholderia, as well as the
glucose-fermenter Klebsiella, but present in one
Canadian C. meningosepticum strain (Figure 2).
Furthermore, C. meningosepticum, B. cepacia,
P. aeruginosa strain P1, and K. pneumoniae
differed in terms of their RAPD fingerprints.
Discussion
Our study provides evidence of the emer-
gence of a group of atypical strains of
C. meningosepticum causing systemic infections
of patients in Taiwan. This conclusion is based on
phylogenetic clustering of the four index strains
according to 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis
and the similarity of the biochemical characteris-
tics, cellular fatty acid profiles, and antibiograms
expressed by all 17 isolates. However, unequivo-
cal evidence of these strains as a new species
within the genus Chryseobacterium will require
confirmation by DNA-DNA hybridization studies.
The emergence of this specific biovar of the 17
strains has important clinical implications. First,
this organism is highly pathogenic for newborn
infants and immunocompromised patients, usu-
ally causing nosocomial as well as community-
acquired systemic infections with substantial
rates of illness and death. Second, rapid, accurate
identification of the strain may be challenging for
clinical microbiology laboratories. An automated
bacterial identification system such as the ID 32
GN (Biomerieux, St. Louis, MO), initially
misidentified all 17 isolates reported in this study
as A. salmonicida. The reason for the misidenti-
fication remains unclear, although both A. salmo-
nicida and C. meningosepticum are relatively
biochemically inert and share some common
biochemical characteristics, such as being esculin
hydrolysis- and gelatin hydrolysis-positive and
motility negative. That A. salmonicida is truly
indole negative may be a clue, but a positive
indole reaction for these atypical strains was
difficult to obtain without special conventional
test media and conditions. Because this ID 32
GN system is widely used in many clinical
microbiology laboratories for the identification
of gram-negative rods (19), this system should
be updated or modified to improve its
proficiency in identifying this as well as other
emerging pathogens. Third, as with typical
C. meningosepticum, choosing optimal antibiotic
regimens for treating infections caused by the
atypical strain was difficult because of the
multidrug-resistant nature of the organism. All
17 clinical isolates were resistant to various
antimicrobial agents, especially ß-lactam antibi-
otics and aminoglycosides. The most effective
drug we tested in this study was ciprofloxacin.
The only other drug displaying better activity
was piperacillin; however, its MIC values
appeared higher, and 4 of the 17 isolates showed
high-level resistance (ß 16 mg/mL). The role of
fluoroquinolones in the treatment of C. menin-
gosepticum infections may be important because
of their low MICs (20,21). Successful response to
treatment has also been reported with trimetho-
prim-sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin, rifampin,
clindamycin, and erythromycin (2,4,5,9), antibi-
otics mainly used for treating gram-positive
bacterial infections. Most of these potentially
effective antibiotics will not be included in the
panel of susceptibility testing for any commonly
isolated gram-negative bacteria other than
Chryseobacterium. Therefore, accurate identifi-
cation of these strains by either complete
biochemical investigation or updated automated
identification systems is crucial in selecting
appropriate antimicrobial susceptibility testing
and proper antibiotic therapy.
The 17 isolates from patients with systemic
infections in Taiwan generated RAPD finger-
prints that differed substantially from those
of C. meningosepticum strains from Canada.
Even among the 17, 8 different RAPD types were
identified. Using RAPD typing, we identified
an apparently conserved 0.4-kb fragment in the
DNA fingerprints of the 17 isolates. This genetic
marker was absent from the types of other
glucose-nonfermentingbacteria,suchasPseudomo-
nas and Burkholderia and the glucose-fermenter
Klebsiella. However, one Canadian C. meningosep-
ticum isolate had this specific genetic marker,
suggesting that the atypical C. meningosepticum
biovar of strains reported in this study may have
been present in North America. Only a specific
ribotype has been reported as an epidemiologic
marker of C. meningosepticum in human
infections (11). Whether the 0.4-kb band will be
useful as an epidemiologic marker or repre-
sents a unique virulence factor is the subject of
further studies.
In summary, we present evidence for the
emergence of a cluster of atypical C. meningosepti-
cum strains in Taiwan. This organism, which is
486Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 6, No. 5, September–October 2000
Research
highly pathogenic for newborns and immunocom-
promised patients, may be misidentified by some
commercially available kit systems even at the
genus level. Complete conventional biochemical
testing is useful for an accurate identification.
Such identification would provide clinicians
with important information about the patho-
genic capability of a strain and its general
susceptibility profile.
