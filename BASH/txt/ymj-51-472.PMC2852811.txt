Infections caused by Salmonella spp. are common and the incidence is increasing
in many countries.1
Not uncommonly, non-typhoid Salmonella (NTS) causes
infections in immunocompromised hosts, such as patients with malignancies,
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), diabetes mellitus, and those
receiving corticosteroid therapy.2
The clinical spectrum of NTS infections ranges
from asymptomatic chronic carrier state, gastroenteritis, enteric fever, bacteremia
to extraintestinal localized complications such as fatal endovascular infection.3
However, psoas abscess due to NTS has rarely been reported.4,5
We here describe
a patient with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) who developed psoas abscess caused
by NTS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of psoas abscess
caused by NTS in such hosts.
In early November of 2005, a 52-year-old man with a three-month history of
severe aplastic anemia (SAA) developed left hip pain that was initially treated as
muscle strain. His baseline hemogram remained low (white blood cell, 2.23×
103
/µL; hemoglobin, 6.8 gm/dL; platelet, 14×103
/µL) even after therapy with
antithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporine, and corticosteroid for his SAA.
Fever with progressive dyspnea developed in the following three weeks with
septic shock and respiratory failure (PaO2 = 56.4 mmHg on 60% supplemental
oxygen) then ensued. The patient was put on mechanical ventilation assistance. At
that time, the hemogram showed anemia (hemoglobin 6.7 gm/dL), leukopenia

The clinical spectrum of infections caused by non-typhoid Salmonella spp. includes gastroenteritis, enteric fever,
bacteremia, and extraintestinal localized complications, especially in immunocompromised hosts. Here we report a
patient with severe aplastic anemia developing left iliopsoas abscess caused by non-typhoid Salmonella (NTS),
which was successfully treated by prolonged antibiotic treatment and repeated debridement. Our data indicate that
aplastic anemia is a risk factor for infection caused by NTS.

INTRODUCTION
CASEREPORT
(total leukocyte count, 0.74×103
/µL, with 78% of neutro-
phils and 16% of lymphocytes), and severe thrombocy-
topenia (platelet 7×103
/µL). Elevated C-reactive protein
(CRP, 26.76 mg/dL) and acute renal failure (creatinine 4.0
mg/dL) were also noted. The chest radiograph was unremar-
kable. Cefepime (2 gm, every 12 hours, intravenously) and
metronidazole (250 mg, every 6 hours, intravenously)
were administrated empirically along with granulocyte-
colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (300 µg, every day).
The computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and
pelvis disclosed a hypodense lesion, measuring 2.5×2 cm
in size, in the left psoas-iliacus muscle (Fig. 1). Both of the
first two sets of blood culture yielded Salmonella O9 (Group
D). The bacterial culture of the pus-like aspirate via CT
guided aspiration of suspected psoas abscess also yielded
Salmonella O9 (Group D). With a two-week course of G-
CSF and antibiotics, hypoxemia and inflammatory surro-
gates improved (CRP, 3.65 mg/dL), and the blood culture
became sterile. However, newly-onset left calf pain with
redness and swelling developed on hospital day 14. A CT
scan of the lower limbs revealed an abscess and deep
fascia thickening at the left calf muscle area. Open drainage
of the left calf abscess and repeated debridement for the
left psoas-iliacus abscess were performed. Osteomyelitis
was noted during the operation. Ceftriaxone (2 gm every
12 hours, intravenously) and metronidazole (250 mg every
6 hours, intravenously) were maintained thereafter. The
patient then became afebrile and was discharged with cipro-
floxacin (750 mg, every 12 hours, orally) after a three-month
hospitalization. The patient had three more admissions
later for wound debridement and parenteral antibiotic
therapy after the first discharge due to recurrent fever and
intolerable hip pain in the subsequent nine months. Cipro-
floxacin was discontinued after 10 months of use. To date,
the patient remains in good condition. This case demons-
trates a special condition that required long-term antibiotic
use after focal NTS infection. The entire therapeutic course
is summarized in Fig. 2.
Among the five clinical manifestations of salmonellosis,
acute gastroenteritis is the most common presentation (up

to 75%). Asymptomatic chronic carrier state, enteric fever,
bacteremia, and extraintestinal localized complications of
the meninges, joints, wounds, or gall bladder account for
the remaining cases.6
Generally, pyogenic iliopsoas abs-
cess can be divided into two categories. First, the abscess
is secondary to the hematogenous spread of Staphyloco-
ccus aureus (SA).7
The second category consists of abscess
formation subsequent to infections of the neighboring
organs and/or tissues. Mixed enteric bacteria predominate
in the latter group.8
However, psoas abscess caused by
NTS is extremely rare. Patients with underlying diseases
such as diabetes, cancer, human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) infection, reticuloendothelial blockade (e.g., malaria,
sickle cell disease, or bartonellosis), and suppressed immu-
nity of all kinds are at increased risk for NTS infections.2
Other pathogens causing psoas muscle abscess - including
Mycobacterium avium intracellulare, tuberculosis, and
disseminated nocardiosis9,10
- have also emerged, especially
among patients with HIV infection.11
A previous report also pointed out that debridement was
indicated for more effective control of psoas abscess.8
The
diagnosis of iliopsoas abscess is often delayed due to vague
initial presentations, low index of suspicion among physi-
cians, and a lack of specific physical signs in this anatomic
area as demonstrated in the present case. It is not uncom-
mon for patients to experience symptoms for weeks to
months before a proper diagnosis is ultimately made.12
A
CT scan is probably the most sensitive diagnostic method
and CT-guided pecutaneous catheter drainage could
further help confirm the diagnosis and obtain appropriate
therapeutic interventions.13,14
Our patient was the first case of NTS psoas muscle
abscess with an underlying disease of SAA. The com-
bination of ATG and cyclosporine as immunosuppressive
reagents is the current standard therapy in SAA.15
Immuno-
suppressive therapy (IST) makes the patients with aplastic
anemia even more susceptible to life-threatening infections.
In addition to immunocompromized status, bleeding
tendency would complicate any surgical intervention and
further obscure optimal surgical timing in this group of
patients. Besides, local hematoma related to bleeding
tendency would make infection control even more diffi-
cult. Therefore, maintenance of adequate platelet count by
component therapy before surgical interventions to prevent
formation of local hematoma is paramount in such patients.
In summary, we demonstrated the first case of psoas
abscess caused by NTS in a patient with SAA. Psoas
abscess caused by NTS should be suspected when an
immunocompromised patient presents as hip or back pain
in the presence of severe infection. Early surgical inter-
vention is critical to control the infection despite severe
thrombocytopenia in this group of patients.
