INTRODUCTION
Sturge-Weber syndrome is a sporadic condition of meso-
dermal phakomatosis characterized by a portwine vascular
nevus on the upper part of the face, leptomeningeal angio-
matosis that involves one or both hemispheres, choroidal vas-
cular lesions associated with glaucoma, seizures, neurologic
deterioration, and eventual neurodevelopmental delay (1).
Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, also a mesodermal
phakomatosis, is defined by a triad of cutaneous and visceral
hemangiomas, which can appear at any site of the body, venous
varicosities, and soft tissue or bone hypertrophy (2). Overlap
between Sturge-Weber syndrome and Klippel-Trenaunay-
Weber syndrome is recognized (3). Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber
syndrome is a nonhereditary condition that shares clinical
features with Sturge-Weber syndrome and over 40 cases of
combined Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome and Sturge-
Weber syndrome have now been described (4).
Phakomatosis pigmentovascularis is a distinctive associa-
tion of cutaneous hemangiomas and melanocytic nevi. The
hemangiomas consist of extensive nevus flammeus, while the
melanocytic lesions may be aberrant mongolian spots, nevus
of Ota, and nevus of Ito. Nevus of Ota is a permanent, non-
homogeneous bluish gray, black or brown lesion on the facial
skin limited to the area innervated by the first and second
divisions of the trigeminal nerve, with frequent association
of the ipsilateral ocular pigmentation.
We experienced an unusual case of male infant with fea-
tures of both Sturge-Weber syndrome and Klippel-Trenaunay-
Weber syndrome, who presented with nevus flammeus on the
face, back and leg, leptomeningeal angiomatosis on right
hemisphere, hypertrophy of the right leg, hemiconvulsion,
congenital glaucoma and nevus of Ota.
CASE REPORT
A 4-month-old male infant presented with nevus flammeus
on the right leg and both part of the face and back, hyper-
trophy of the right leg and first attack of hemiconvulsion on
the left. A diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome was made
during neonatal period on the basis of portwine vascular nevus
on the upper part of the face, leptomeningeal angiomatosis
that involves right hemisphere, choroidal vascular lesions asso-
ciated with glaucoma. He had not taken any other form of
medication in the previous 3 months.
His physical examination showed nevus flammeus diffuse-
ly involving the both side of his face and extending to the
both lower eyelids and cheeks. There were bilateral oculoder-
mal melanosis and an area of bluish gray pigmentation of the
episclera (Fig. 1). Diffuse bluish discoloration or spots were
present on the left side of his shoulder, arm, and wrist (Fig.

An Infantile Case of Sturge-Weber Syndrome in Association with
Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome and Phakomatosis
Pigmentovascularis
Sturge-Weber syndrome can be associated with facial port-wine stains and intra-
cranial calcification, and concurrent Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome has been
reported. Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome is a rare congenital mesodermal
phakomatosis characterized by cutaneous hemangiomas, venous varicosities and
soft tissue or bone hypertrophy of the affected extremities. This report is presented
a rare case of the Sturge-Weber syndrome in combination with the Klippel-Tren-
naunay syndrome and phakomatosis pigmentovascularis in a 4-month-old infant.
He showed nevus flameus on the right leg and both part of the face and back, lep-
tomeningeal angiomatosis on right hemisphere, hypertrophy of the right leg, hemi-
convulsion on the left and also evidences of congenital glaucoma and nevus of
Ota. Very rare case combined with these three kinds of phakomatosis has been
reported.

2). His right lower limb showed a relative soft tissue hyper-
trophy and nevus flammeus (Fig. 3). There was no difference
in length of both lower limb. But the circumference of his
right thigh was 25 cm and that of his left thigh was 21.5 cm.
The hematologic, biochemical, and urinary laboratory tests
and the chest and skull radiographs were normal. Abdominal
ultrasonography showed no pathologic findings of the visceral
organs. On cranial computed tomography scan, there was
hyper-dense appearance secondary to meningeal venous an-
giomatous change on the right cerebral hemisphere (Fig. 4).
The patient was diagnosed to have Sturge-Weber syndrome
in association with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome,
according to the results of physical examination and radio-
logic evaluation.
Treatment with anticonvulsant was begun. But hemiseizures
were recurred several times. His electroencephalography re-
vealed low amplitude polyphasic spikes and waves activity,
and voltage suppression in right hemisphere. The frequency
of seizure was reduced probably due to anticonvulsants, exce-
gran, acetazolamide and corticosteroid. At the time of dis-
charge his medical regime included excegran and acetazolea-
mide.
DISCUSSION
Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome is present at birth and
usually involves a lower extremity but may involve more than
one and portions of trunk or face. Enlargement of the soft
tissues may be gradual and may involve the entire extremity,
a portion of it, or selected digits. Thick-walled venous vari-
cosities typically become apparent ipsilateral to the vascular
malformation after child begins to ambulate. Supportive care
includes compression bandages for varicosities and surgical
treatment may help selected patients. Associated complica-
tion include dislocation of joint, congestive heart failure, cere-
bral arteriovenous malformations, spinal arteriovenous mal-
formations, macrocephaly, microcephaly, thombophlebitis,
hematuria, rectal bleeding and orbitofrontal varices (5, 6).
Sturge-Weber syndrome is a rare, sporadic disease with a
potentially progressive course. Facial and leptomeningeal
angioma are usually, but not necessarily, on the same side (7).
About 70% of patients with epilepsy have their first seizure
within the first year of life. The initial seizures often involve
the hemibody contralateral to the pial angioma and early
seizures are triggered by fever in about one third of cases (8).
Almost all the early seizures qualify as status epilepticus. The
outcome after the first seizures is variable, but long term fol-
low-up have shown that the seizure are often well controlled.
Interictal EEG in Sturge-Weber syndrome shows focal and
unilateral depression of the background activity over the area
of leptomeningeal agiomatosis (9, 10). Focal epileptiform

abnormalities are infrequent in infants, even in those with
frequent seizures (10). Surgery should be considered early
when medical treatment fails. The earlier the surgery with
respect to seizure onset, the less the chance of increased neu-
rologic deterioration (11).
Nevus of Ota is more common in females and in Asian and
black patients, and differs from a Mongolian spots, not only
by its distribution but also by having a speckled rather than
a uniform appearance. Malignant change is rare and laser thera-
py may effectively decrease the pigmentation.
Four types of phakomatosis pigmentovascularis have been
recognized, each of which are subgrouped further by the abs-
cence (type a) or presence (type b) of systemic organ involve-
ment. All types of phakomatosis pigmentovascularis have
nevus flammeus as a component. In addition to nevus flam-
meus, type I has an epidermal nevus, type II has blue spots
with or without nevus anemicus, type III has nevus spilus,
with or without nevus anemicus, type IV has blue spots and
nevus spilus with or without nevus anemicus. Our case can be
classified as type IIa, according to the classification of phako-
matosis pigmentovascularis. Phakomatosis pigmentovascu-
laris is a rare disorder characterized by the association of a
nevus flammeus and melanocytic lesions. Phakomatosis pig-
mentovascularis was first described as association of cuta-
neous hemangioma and melanotic or epidermal nevi by Ota
in 1939 (12). Abnormalities in the neural regulations of blood
vessels may be important in the development of the vascu-
lar component of phakomatosis pigmentovascularis. Anoma-
ly in the migration of the neural crest-derived melanocytes
would result in nevus of Ota, Mongolian spots and nevus
spilus. There is double heterozygosity with the recessive vas-
cular mutation on chromosome and the pigmentary muta-
tion on the homologous chromosome. During embryogene-
sis, somatic recombination or crossing-over occurs between
the homologous chromosomes, resulting in 2 different cell
populations, each being homozygous for either allele. Asso-
ciated clinical manifestation of the above-mentioned neu-
rophacomatosis include scoliosis, renal angiomas, moyamoya
disease, aplastic anemia, abdominal lymphangioma, chylotho-
rax, deafness, chronic thyroiditis, pyogenic granuloma and
mental retardation.
There is no specific curative treatment for this combined
disorder. Recognition of possible underlying systemic and
local anomalies and complications dictates management.
We present a 4-monthold baby boy who is considered as
an interesting case of Sturge-Weber syndrome in association
with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome and phakomato-
sis pigmentovascularis. To the best of our knowledge, Klip-
pel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome has been reported many
times, and the only one case of Sturge-Weber syndrome in
association with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome and
phakomatosis pigmentovascularis has been reported in 13-
yr-old girl (13). But the infantile case of the above-mentioned
combined neurophacomatosis has not been reported. In infan-
tile case there were no venous varicosities and bony hyper-
trophy of the affected extremities.
