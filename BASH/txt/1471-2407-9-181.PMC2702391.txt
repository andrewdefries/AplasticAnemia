Abstract
Background: The Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome is a chromosomal instability disorder
characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, immunodeficiency, and increased frequency of
cancers. Familial studies on relatives of these patients indicated that they also appear to be at
increased risk of cancer.
Methods: In a candidate gene study aiming at identifying genetic determinants of breast cancer
susceptibility, we undertook the full sequencing of the NBN gene in our cohort of 97 high-risk non-
BRCA1 and -BRCA2 breast cancer families, along with 74 healthy unrelated controls, also from the
French Canadian population. In silico programs (ESEfinder, NNSplice, Splice Site Finder and
MatInspector) were used to assess the putative impact of the variants identified. The effect of the
promoter variant was further studied by luciferase gene reporter assay in MCF-7, HEK293, HeLa
and LNCaP cell lines.
Results: Twenty-four variants were identified in our case series and their frequency was further
evaluated in healthy controls. The potentially deleterious p.Ile171Val variant was observed in one
case only. The p.Arg215Trp variant, suggested to impair NBN binding to histone γ-H2AX, was
observed in one breast cancer case and one healthy control. A promoter variant c.-242-
110delAGTA displayed a significant variation in frequency between both sample sets. Luciferase
reporter gene assay of the promoter construct bearing this variant did not suggest a variation of
expression in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, but indicated a reduction of luciferase expression
in both the HEK293 and LNCaP cell lines.
Conclusion: Our analysis of NBN sequence variations indicated that potential NBN alterations are
present, albeit at a low frequency, in our cohort of high-risk breast cancer cases. Further analyses
will be needed to fully ascertain the exact impact of those variants on breast cancer susceptibility,
in particular for variants located in NBN promoter region.

Background
Pathogenic mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, ATM,
CHEK2, BRIP1 and PALB2 have been associated with an
increased breast cancer risk and, together, are found in less
than 25% of breast cancer families showing a clear pattern
of inheritance (high-risk families) [1]. It is thus clear that
other susceptibility alleles remain to be identified to
explain the increased risk in the remnant high-risk fami-
lies. As the number and characteristics of such alleles are
undetermined, a focussed candidate gene approach based
on genes closely interacting with the known susceptibility
genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, the two major suscepti-
bility genes identified yet, constitutes a study design of
choice to identify rare-moderate-penetrance susceptibility
alleles.
In the cell, nibrin, encoded by the NBN gene (also known
as NBS1), participates in pathways of double strand
breaks (DSB)-induced DNA repair and, together with its
partners MRE11A and RAD50, is required for activation of
these pathways in response to DNA damages [2]. In fact,
nibrin is at the crossroad of several pathways implicating
genes already associated with breast cancer susceptibility
and/or chromosomal instability disorders [2,3]. Individu-
als homozygous for hypomorphic mutations in NBN suf-
fer from the Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS), an
autosomal recessive chromosomal instability disorder
characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation,
immunodeficiency and hyper-radiosensitivity [4]. Can-
cers, in particular haematological malignancies, are com-
mon adverse events in patients with NBS, as almost 40%
of them develop a malignancy before the age of 21 years,
and this correlates with a marked impairment in DSB
repair observed in cells from these patients [5].
Some studies have associated an heterozygous NBN status
with numerous types of cancers, including breast cancer
[6-10], suggesting that being a carrier of a deleterious
mutation in NBN may confer an increased risk of approx-
imately 2 to 3-fold [6]. This was also supported by the
observation that relatives of NBS patients display a higher
than expected rate of cancers [4,11]. However, other stud-
ies failed to find an association with an increased risk of
cancer [12,13].
In support of a role of NBN in tumor formation, evidence
from mouse models demonstrated that Nbn heterozygos-
ity predisposes cells to malignancies, as they display a
wide variety of tumors: liver, mammary gland, prostate,
lung as well as lymphomas [14]. Indeed, cells from these
mice displayed an elevated frequency of chromosomal
aberrations. These observations were correlated by studies
of NBN heterozygous mutation carriers demonstrating
that cell lines from these individuals showed spontaneous
chromosomal instability (chromatid and chromosomes
breaks, and chromosomes rearrangements) [15,16] as
well as increased sensitivity to radiation-induced chromo-
somal aberrations [17]. Thus, it has been hypothesized
that in cells of carriers of deleterious mutations in DNA
repair genes such as NBN, a decrease in DNA repair capa-
bilities resulting from a gene dosage effect (i.e. lower gene
expression) may be sufficient to create a permissive envi-
ronment for tumor development [18,19]. It has also been
suggested that these DNA repair genes may show differ-
ences in tissue-specific protein-dosage thresholds, below
which they may fail to operate normally [20].
Thus, based on the close relation of NBN and known
breast cancer susceptibility genes in the cell DNA repair
pathways, and the studies suggesting a possible involve-
ment of NBN alterations in cancer susceptibility, we
undertook the analysis of the entire coding sequence,
intron/exon junctions, as well as the proximal promoter
region of the NBN gene. We therefore performed a thor-
ough re-sequencing of a series of 97 breast cancer cases
selected from high-risk families from the French Canadian
population, and 74 unrelated healthy controls from the
same origin for sequence variations that could possibly
modulate breast cancer risk.
Methods
Ascertainment of families
All 97 non-BRCA1/2 individuals from high-risk French
Canadian breast and ovarian cancer families participating
in this study were part of a larger interdisciplinary pro-
gram termed INHERIT BRCAs [21]. All participants were
at least 18 years of age and had to sign an informed con-
sent form. Ethics committees reviewed the research
project at the 7 participating institutions from which the
patients were referred. The details regarding selection cri-
teria of the breast cancer cases as well as the experimental
and clinical procedures have been described previously
[21,22].
PCR amplification and direct sequencing
PCR amplification of NBN (NM_002485.4) coding
sequence, as well as flanking intronic regions, was per-
formed on breast cancer cases and controls using primer
pairs as described in Table 1. Sequencing reactions and
sequence analysis were performed as described previously
[22]. Alternative splice screening was also performed on
cDNA on a subset of breast cancer cases using primers as
described in Table 1.
Variants characterization and haplotype estimations
Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and
allelic difference between both series was evaluated using
a two-sided Chi Square test with 1 degree of freedom. The
possible effect of a given variant on exonic splicing
enhancers was assessed using the ESEfinder 3.0 program

[23] and on splice consensus sites using NNSPLICE [24]
and Splice Site Finder [25] web based programs. The
potential impact of the promoter variant and pairwise
linkage disequilibrium were evaluated as described else-
where [26]. Haplotype analysis was performed using the
WHAP program [27] implementing a regression-based
association test allowing for evaluation of haplotype-spe-
cific association. Haplotype analyses were performed on
all variants identified as well as on variants showing a
minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 5%.
Luciferase promoter assays
A portion of 401 bp of the NBN promoter region, and the
entire 5'UTR sequence (110 bp), was amplified by PCR
from a breast cancer individual carrier of the c.-242-
110delAGTA deletion using primers introducing a NheI or
a HindIII restriction site (Table 1). PCR products were
then digested and introduced in the pGL3 basic vector
(Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). Direct
sequencing of clones was performed to confirm the pres-
ence of the reference sequence allele as well as the four
nucleotides deletion. Transient transfections in MCF-7,
LNCaP, HeLa and HEK293 cells and dual luciferase
reporter assays were performed as described previously
[26], with cells harvested 24–48 h after transfection.
ATBF1 expression levels were measured in these four cell
lines by quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) as
described previously [28], using RNA extracted by the
TriReagent method (Molecular Research Center Inc,
Cincinnati, OH, USA) and specific primers (sens: 5'-
TGCAACTAAACCGCCCACATATA-3'; antisens 5'-
CCCCAAGTGAGATAAAGCTAAACAAA-3'). Levels of
expression were normalized using the housekeeping gene
HPRT1, and are indicated relative to the MCF-7 cell line
(sens primer: 5'-AGTTCTGTGGCCATCTGCTTAGTAG-3';
antisens primer: 5'-AAACAACAATCCGCCCAAAGG-3').
Results
Sequence variations in the NBN gene
Direct sequencing of NBN entire coding region, adjacent
intronic sequences as well as the proximal promoter
region was performed on 97 affected individuals from
French Canadian breast and ovarian cancer families (one
individual per family). Twenty-four variants were identi-
fied (Tables 2, 3 and Figure 1), including a new rare syn-
onymous change at codon 127 (c.381T/C) and a new
variant located in intron 15 (c.2234+86T/G), both not
reported in the literature and databases, and found exclu-
sively among breast cancer cases. Variants identified in the
case dataset were also genotyped in 74 healthy individuals
from the same population. All SNPs genotyped were in
HWE. Nine out of the 24 variations were located in the
coding region (Table 2), while the remaining 15 were
located in untranslated regions (Table 3). Among all vari-
ants identified, half (12) were considered as common
(MAF ≥ 5%) while the remaining 12 were rare variations.
Two rare non-synonymous exonic variants (c.511A/G and
c.797C/T) were observed only once in the case series, of
which p.Ile171Val is located in the first BRCA1 C-terminal
(BRCT) domain (Figure 1). Of these two variants, only
c.511A/G could be genotyped in an additional family
member, i.e. an unaffected male cousin, who was found
non-carrier (data not shown). Two other rare variants,
c.283G/A and c.643C/T, were both observed in one breast
cancer case and one control. For the c.643C/T variant, a
DNA sample from another available family member
affected with ovarian cancer was analyzed and turned out
to be wild type (data not shown). Among the variants
located in untranslated regions (Table 3), the
c.2234+86T/G variant was present exclusively in two
breast cancer cases. When genotype frequencies of all var-
iants were compared between both series, only the c.-242-
110delAGTA variant in the promoter showed a statisti-
cally significant association with breast cancer (OR 3.4,
95% CI: 1.1–10.5; p = 0.029).
Identification of NBN alternative splice forms
Analysis of NBN cDNA was also performed on a subset of
these breast cancer cases and highlighted the presence of
two distinct alternative splice events. The first splice vari-
ant involved the insertion of 50 bp of the intron between
exons 2 and 3 and is expected to result in a premature stop
codon [29]. The other alternative splice form identified
involves the skipping of exons 12 to 14 which is expected
to produce an in-frame deletion of 113 amino acids in the
region of the NBN protein involved in the interaction
with its partner MRE11A (Figure 1). However, QRT-PCR
of this specific form was performed on cDNA samples
from a subset of 10 breast cancer cases from our cohort
and showed a very low expression relative to the main iso-
form (data not shown), which is consistent with previous
work [30].
In silico analysis of the putative impact of NBN exonic and
intronic sequence variants on these splice events was also
performed. Analysis of the nine exonic sequence variants
using ESEfinder indicated that, while five variants
(c.283G/A, c.553G/C, c.643C/T, c.797C/T, and
c.1197T>C) might have an impact on putative score
motifs of four SR proteins, a closer examination of these
results shows that these scores, while below the program
thresholds, remain relatively high and thus are unlikely to
affect NBN constitutive splicing (Figure 2). According to
the Splice Site prediction program, the intronic variant
c.896+36G/A might slightly increase a putative acceptor
site (score from 0.66 to 0.75). However, this was not con-
firmed by the Splice Site Finder program, which predicted
the abolition of a putative donor site with a score of 71.2.
As for the c.1124+91C/A intronic variant, only the Splice
Site Prediction program predicted the abolition of a weak

intronic variant, the Splice Site Finder program estimated
the creation of a putative acceptor site with a score of 77.2.
Hence, none of the variants identified are expected to be
responsible for the alternative splice events observed.
Effect of the c.-242-110delAGTA variant on luciferase
reporter gene expression
The putative effect of the c.-242-110delAGTA variant
located in the promoter region was also assessed by the
MatInspector program, which predicts that this variant
may abolish recognition motifs for the ZFHX3/ATBF1
(Zinc finger homeobox 3, or AT motif-binding factor 1),
NKX3-1 (NK3 homeobox 1) and CDX2 (Caudal-type
homeobox 2) transcription factors, and create a potential
binding site for the MTBF (Muscle-specific MT binding
factor) transcription factor (Figure 3A). The effect of the c.-
242-110delAGTA variant on NBN expression was there-
fore further assessed using a dual reporter gene system.
MCF-7, LNCaP, HeLa and HEK293 cells were then tran-
siently transfected with a construct containing the consen-
sus NBN sequence or with the variant sequence, together
with the Renilla reporter plasmid as an internal transfec-
tion control (Figure 3B). While no significant difference in
expression was observed between both constructs in MCF-
7 and HeLa cells, a slight diminution of luciferase expres-
sion was observed for the variant construct relative to the
reference sequence construct in both the HEK293 and

LNCaP cell lines (Figure 3C). Interestingly, QRT-PCR
measures indicated that ATBF1 mRNA is 2.4 times more
expressed in HeLa cells, and more than 4.3 times more
expressed in LNCaP cells, than in MCF-7 cells (data not
shown).
LD analysis across NBN genomic sequence and haplotypes
determination
Pairwise LD measures of all variants using the control
dataset are presented in Figure 4. |D'| values show a high
degree of LD for all SNP pairs while the more stringent r2
measure, dependent upon allele frequency, shows a lim-
ited block of LD involving mainly SNPs located in the sec-
ond half of the NBN gene. The bottom part of Figure 4
shows the r2 HapMap CEU data in the vicinity of NBN on
chromosome 8, and suggests that NBN may overlap two
blocks of LD. The major part of NBN seems to be in a
strong block of LD extending 5' of the gene, while its 3'
extremity spans over another smaller block.
Haplotype phasing of NBN using the WHAP program
with all 24 variants identified in our datasets indicated
that 14 haplotypes are present with an estimated fre-
quency greater than 0.5%. Although WHAP did not esti-
mate a significant difference between both groups, the p-
value observed was borderline significant (p = 0.0588).

The majority of these estimated haplotypes (84.5%) have
a frequency greater than 2%. Two haplotypes (#4 and #7
in Table 4) showed a weak significant association with
breast cancer, being more frequent among cases (p =
0.0205 and p = 0.0403, respectively). The same analysis,
using only common variations (MAF >5%), suggested
that one haplotype is more frequent among cases than
controls (WH4, p = 0.0227), with another haplotype
showing a non-significant trend of over-representation in
cases (WH5, p = 0.0883) (Table 5). Global estimation of
haplotypes was further confirmed using the PHASE 2.1.1
program, with concordant results (data not shown).
A closer examination of these two haplotypes (WH4 and
WH5) showed that the only variation present on WH4 is
the c.-242-110delAGTA variant, which on its own shows a
significant difference in frequency between both groups.
Thus, this variant is likely to be responsible of the associ-
ation observed as any further breakdown of this haplo-
type using a sliding window analysis shows that all
combinations involving this variant display a significant
association (data not shown). As for the WH5 haplotype
carrying the c.1197T/C variant in exon 10, it does not
show any significant difference in frequency between the
both groups and, despite its strong linkage disequilibrium
with the adjacent variants, it shows only a tendency
towards significativity when present in combination with
the major alleles at all other positions (Table 5).
Discussion
Although the relevance of mutations in several DNA
repair genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, PTEN, PALB2, BRIP1)
in breast cancer susceptibility have been well established,
the association of variants in other genes, potentially
accounting for the remaining familial clustering, is not
well defined. For example, heterozygous carriers of delete-
rious mutations in the NBN gene, in particular the Slavic
founder mutation 657del5, has been associated with a 2-
to 3-fold increased risk of cancer [6]. However the impact
of other NBN variants on cancer risk is unclear. Nonethe-
less, studies have demonstrated an increased spontaneous
chromosomal instability in cells from heterozygous carri-
ers of NBN mutations [7,16]. In addition, the presence of
a specific pattern of gene expression involving pathways
of DNA repair and damage bypass, mitotic checkpoint
and apoptosis was demonstrated, suggesting that cells
from these carriers may display a much less efficient DNA
repair system [31]. In this regard, a recent study by
Someya et al. [32] showed a correlation between persist-
ent radiation-induced NBN foci and both chromosomal
instability and sporadic breast cancer risk. To address the
possible implication of NBN sequence variants on breast
cancer risk, we took advantage of our resource of high-risk
breast cancer families drawn from the French Canadian
population. In order to increase the statistical power of
our investigation, one affected individual from each fam-
ily was selected for analysis [33], each thoroughly
screened for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations or large
genomic rearrangements in these genes [21].
The majority of the coding variants identified in our
cohort of breast cancer cases are situated in the forkhead-
associated (FHA) domain and the two BRCT domains,
and these domains have been demonstrated to be essen-
tial to NBN binding to the histone γ-H2AX [34,35]. One
of the rare variants identified in this study, p.Ile171Val,
was first described in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
patients [36]. This variant has been previously reported to

be over-represented in some cancer cohorts [9,10,37,38],
and has also been previously described at the
homozygous state in a Japanese NBS patient affected with
aplastic anemia and genomic instability [39]. Interest-
ingly, analysis of the patient's and her father's lymphob-
lastoid cell lines demonstrated a higher frequency of
spontaneous chromosomal aberrations compared with
healthy controls (6- and 4-fold increase, respectively).
These results suggest that the p.Ile171Val variation may be
deleterious, also supported by the fact that this variant
alters an amino acid which is conserved in species such as
the chicken and the fruitfly [39]. However, the impact of
the p.Ile171Val substitution remains to be clarified as a
large study, including cases from Germany and the
Republic of Belarus, did not find any association with
breast cancer in those populations [40].
Another rare variant, p.Arg215Trp, has been considered
pathogenic in previous studies based on its highly con-
served position and the change introduced. Moreover, this
variant has been identified in monozygotic twins com-
pound heterozygotes for 657del5/p.Arg215Trp and
affected with a severe form of NBS [41]. NibrinTrp215
appears to affect the correct nibrin function, and cells car-
rying this variant shows delayed DNA DSB rejoining [41].
Modelisation of the tandem BRCT domains suggests that
the Arg215 residue is required for correct orientation of
the BRCT domains and recognition of γ-H2AX [34]. In
their experiment, nibrinTrp215 seems to partially interfere
with nibrinArg215 activity and may act in a co-dominant
fashion. It is also interesting to note that although this var-
iant is relatively frequent in several studies, to our knowl-
edge no NBS cases homozygous for this variant have been
reported.
Of the other rare variants present in our cohort of breast
cancer cases, the p.Pro266Leu variant was observed in one
breast cancer case, and the p.Asp95Asn variant was found
in one breast cancer case and one control. Although these
variants involve conserved residues, their putative effect
on protein function remains unclear. In a previous study
on non-Hodgkin lymphoma, both variants were detected
only in healthy controls [42]. Regarding the p.Asp95Asn
variant first identified in an ALL patient [36], no associa-
tion was found in a study of larynx cancer [38] or ALL
[37]. This variant was found in one out of 613 and 121
unselected and familial prostate cancer cases, respectively,
but not in controls [43]. However, p.Asp95Asn is not pre-
dicted to be highly damaging as its expression in NBS cells
seems to have a similar activity to the wild type protein
[42]. The only other non-synonymous change identified
in our cohort is the p.Glu185Gln common variant (MAF
>25%), which has been genotyped in several association
studies. Although the majority of the studies analyzing
this variant found no association with cancer [12,38,42-
44], some studies reported an association with breast can-
cer [8], basal cell carcinoma in men [45] and a recent
meta-analysis of this variant in bladder cancer revealed a
significant association after controlling for potential bias
[46]. In addition, Musak et al. [47] reported that this var-
iant may modulate the frequency of chromatid-type aber-
rations among tire plant workers. However, our data do
not allow us to confirm any positive association.
Among the non-coding variants, a possible association of
the c.-242-110delAGTA variant with an increased risk of
breast cancer could be observed (OR 3.4 95% CI: 1.1–
10.5). This association was further confirmed by the esti-
mation of the haplotype diversity in our dataset, which
highlighted the presence of the haplotype bearing the c.-
242-110delAGTA variant at a higher frequency among the
breast cancer case subset. In silico prediction of putative
transcription factor binding sites indicated that of the four
transcription factor binding sites potentially affected by
the deletion, some are predicted to involve proteins not
expressed in the breast. MTBF acts in the muscle regula-
tion of the myostatin gene [48], while CDX2 is mainly
expressed in the gut although its ectopic expression was

also reported in cases of non-gastrointestinal carcinomas
[49]. As for the transcription factor NKX3-1, it is mainly
expressed in the prostate although it is also found at low
levels in the mammary gland and breast tumors, and has
been suggested to act as a haplo-insufficient tumor sup-
pressor in prostate cancer [50]. The fourth transcription
factor potentially affected is ATBF1 (also known as
ZFHX3). ATBF1 was shown to suppress the expression of
the alpha-fetoprotein [51] and the MYB oncogene [52].
ATBF1 also cooperates with p53 to activate the CDKN1A
promoter and trigger cell cycle arrest [53]. ATBF1 is
expressed in the mammary gland and breast tumors
(NCBI's UNIGENE data), and the expression of ATBF1
mRNA was correlated with a better prognosis in 153
patients with invasive carcinomas of the breast [54]. This
might suggest that deregulation of genes controlled
through ATBF1 could have an important impact on breast
cancer formation and progression.
Luciferase reporter gene assay using the promoter
sequence proximal to the ATG codon indicated a similar
level of expression of the c.-242-110delAGTA variant
allele as compared to the reference sequence construct in
the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and in HeLa cells. How-
ever, a slight decrease in luciferase expression was
observed in both HEK293 and LNCaP cells, which might
indicate that this variant could have an impact on NBN
expression in a cell type manner. The analysis of ATBF1
gene expression indicated that this transcription factor is
weakly expressed, in particular in the MCF-7 cells. This is
comparable to a recent study performed on a panel of 32
breast cancer cell lines, which indicated that in 75% of
these cell lines, ATBF1 is expressed at 50% or less relative
to the normal breast [55]. This could in turn explain the
lack of effect observed for the luciferase assay in the MCF-
7 cell line. On the other hand, one could hypothesize that
NBN (or transcription factors affecting its expression)
may be regulated following irradiation or other genotoxic
stress. Additional research will however be needed to
address this possibility, as well as binding experiments to
confirm ATFB1 binding to this region of the promoter.
However, it is also important to keep in mind that the pro-
moter sequence cloned here, although supporting NBN
expression, is unlikely to constitute the entire NBN pro-
moter. It is indeed plausible that transcription factors act-
ing on the proximal sequence might be influenced by
other transcription factors acting further upstream. As
such, despite the lack of variation in expression induction
found in MCF-7 by luciferase assay, it is possible that the
c.-242-110delAGTA variant could be in LD with another
functional variant located elsewhere in the promoter, as a
high degree of LD is present across the whole NBN gene.
Unfortunately, the promoter variant could not be associ-
ated by LD with another variant in the coding region of
the gene, which would have allowed to directly measure
NBN allelic expression.
Conclusion
Our analysis suggests that the variant c.-242-110delAGTA
identified in our cohort of breast cancer individuals and
located in the promoter region of the NBN gene may be
associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. How-
ever, the functional analysis by luciferase promoter assay
does not support a causative effect of this variant in the
breast cancer cell line MCF-7, although a reduction of luci-
ferase expression driven by the NBN promoter can be
observed in two other cell lines tested. As the NBN
genomic region displays a high degree of LD, we cannot
rule out the effect of other variants located upstream of
the region analyzed here. Alternatively, the effect of this
variant may be dependent upon induction by a genotoxic
stress such as irradiation. Although NBS is a rare syn-
drome, carriers of deleterious alterations in this gene are
more common and may display subtle manifestations in
cellular pathways predisposing NBN-mutated carriers to
malignancy. Further analyses will therefore be needed to
ascertain the impact of rare variants and promoter vari-
ants of NBN on breast cancer susceptibility in other pop-
ulations.
