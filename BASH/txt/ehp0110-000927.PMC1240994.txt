The ammonium salt of the perchlorate ion is
manufactured primarily for use by the
Department of Defense, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, and
the aerospace industry as a source of oxygen in
solid propellant systems for rockets and mis-
siles. Ammonium perchlorate is also manufac-
tured for use as an oxidizer in ﬁreworks and
matches and for pharmaceutical use. In addi-
tion, perchlorate can occur naturally in
nitrate-rich mineral deposits used as fertilizers.
Analysis of nine commercial fertilizers revealed
perchlorate in all samples tested at levels rang-
ing from 0.15% to 0.84% by weight (1).
Application of a sensitive new detection
method has revealed widespread perchlorate
contamination of groundwater, particularly in
Utah, California, Nevada, and Arizona.
Perchlorate contamination is also found in sur-
face waters, including Nevada’s Lake Mead.
Recent testing by the Los Angeles Metropolitan
Water District revealed 8 µg/L at its Lake Mead
intake, and the Southern Nevada Water
authority found 11 µg/L in tap water (2).
Sampling by the California Department of
Health Services revealed 5–9 µg/L in the
Colorado River. Of 2,459 drinking-water
sources tested in California, 48 (2.0%)
contained concentrations of perchlorate
higher than the state’s action level of 18 ppb
(3). Assuming a default consumption rate of
2 L/day, perchlorate at 18 ppb (18 µg/L) in
drinking water results in ingestion of 36
µg/day (0.51 µg/kg-day for a 70-kg person).
Perchlorate is a competitive inhibitor of
the process by which iodide, circulating in the
blood, is actively transported into thyroid fol-
licular cells (4,5). The site of this inhibition is
the sodium-iodide symporter, a membrane
protein located on the basolateral side of the
follicular cell, adjacent to the capillaries sup-
plying blood to the thyroid (6). The thyroid
follicle is the functional unit of the thyroid; a
single layer of follicular cells at the surface
surrounds a colloidal protein matrix. At the
colloid interface, organification of iodide
occurs. Organiﬁcation is a complex, enzyme-
dependent process whereby iodide is oxidized
and bound to tyrosyl residues within thy-
roglobulin, ultimately forming the thyroid
hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyrox-
ine (T4). If sufficient inhibition of iodide
uptake occurs, formation of thyroid hor-
mones is depressed. Depression of thyroid
hormone formation secondary to inhibition
of thyroidal iodide uptake is the precursor of
any potentially adverse effect of perchlorate
and is also the basis for its major current and
former pharmaceutical usages.
Treatment of thyrotoxicosis (including
Graves’ disease) with 600–2,000 mg potas-
sium perchlorate (430–1,400 mg perchlorate)
daily for periods of several months or longer
was once common practice, particularly in
Europe (7,8). According to Wolff (9),
although 400 mg of potassium perchlorate
divided into four or ﬁve daily doses was used
initially and found effective, higher doses
were introduced when 400 mg/day was dis-
covered not to control thyrotoxicosis in all
subjects. Also according to Wolff, seven case
reports of fatal aplastic anemia between 1961
and 1966 curtailed the therapeutic use of per-
chlorate at that time (9). However, two
decades later, physicians reported treating
thyrotoxicosis successfully with lower mainte-
nance doses of potassium perchlorate
(40–200 mg/day) for 2 years or longer, in the
absence of adverse effects (10,11). More
recently, perchlorate has been used (alone or
in combination with other antithyroid drugs)
to treat amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis or
hypothyroidism, conditions in which under-
lying thyroid abnormalities are unmasked
when the iodine-containing drug amiodarone
is given to control cardiac arrhythmia (9).
Treatment regimens include 500 mg potas-
sium perchlorate twice per day for 18–40
days (12) and, for mild cases, 250 mg/day for
4–6 weeks (13). When we began the present
study, we hoped our results would allow us to
estimate, for the temporal dosing pattern

Articles
Application of a sensitive new detection method has revealed widespread perchlorate contamina-
tion of groundwater in the southwestern United States, typically at 0.005–0.020 mg/L (5–20
ppb). Perchlorate is a competitive inhibitor of the process by which iodide is actively transported
from the bloodstream into the thyroid. This inhibitory action of perchlorate is the basis of its
pharmaceutical use (in the treatment of hyperthyroidism) as well as its potential toxicity. To
establish the dose response in humans for perchlorate inhibition of thyroidal iodide uptake and
any short-term effects on thyroid hormones, we gave perchlorate in drinking water at 0.007, 0.02,
0.1, or 0.5 mg/kg-day to 37 male and female volunteers for 14 days. In 24 subjects we performed
8- and 24-hr measurements of thyroidal 123I uptake (RAIU) before exposure, on exposure days 2
(E2) and 14 (E14), and 15 days postexposure (P15). In another 13 subjects we omitted both E2
studies and the 8-hr P15 study. We observed a strong correlation between the 8- and 24-hr RAIU
over all dose groups and measurement days. We found no difference between E2 and E14 in the
inhibition of RAIU produced by a given perchlorate dose. We also found no sex difference. On
both E2 and E14, the dose response was a negative linear function of the logarithm of dose. Based
on the dose response for inhibition of the 8- and 24-hr RAIU on E14 in all subjects, we derived
estimates of the true no-effect level: 5.2 and 6.4 µg/kg-day, respectively. Given default body
weight and exposure assumptions, these doses would be ingested by an adult if the drinking-water
supply contained perchlorate at concentrations of approximately 180 and 220 µg/L (ppb), respec-
tively. On P15, RAIU was not signiﬁcantly different from baseline. In 24 subjects we measured
serum levels of thyroxine (total and free), triiodothyronine, and thyrotropin in blood sampled 16
times throughout the study. Only the 0.5 mg/kg-day dose group showed any effect on serum hor-
mones: a slight downward trend in thyrotropin levels in morning blood draws during perchlorate
exposure, with recovery by P15. Key words: clinical, human, iodine, perchlorate, risk assessment,

tested, a maximum effect level for perchlorate
inhibition of iodide uptake. With this infor-
mation in hand, physicians might be
prompted to evaluate the efﬁcacy of perchlo-
rate doses lower than those frequently
employed.
Thyroid hormones are essential to the reg-
ulation of oxygen consumption and metabo-
lism throughout the body. Thyroidal iodine
metabolism and thyroid hormone levels in
serum and tissues are regulated by a number of
homeostatic mechanisms (14). Thyrotropin
(TSH), a hormone synthesized and secreted by
the anterior pituitary gland (hypophysis), is the
primary regulator of thyroidal iodide uptake
and other aspects of thyroid function (15).
When hypothyroidism occurs in a woman
early in pregnancy, the fetus is at risk for
impaired physical and mental development,
the severity of the impairment depending
upon the degree of hypothyroidism. In the
human fetus, the thyroid and the hypophysial
TSH system begin to function at around 11
weeks of gestation, and T4 secretion begins at
around 18–20 weeks of gestation (14).
Hypothyroidism during infancy is also a major
risk factor for mental retardation and other
manifestations of impaired neurodevelopment
(14). To ensure that perchlorate in drinking
water is well below levels that would produce
even mild hypothyroidism, particularly in
pregnant women and infant children, it is
important to determine the dose response for
perchlorate inhibition of iodide uptake and the
relationship between iodide uptake inhibition
and depression of thyroid hormone levels.
Before we began our study, the potential
health effects in humans of long-term expo-
sure to perchlorate at doses below the
therapeutic range were examined in two cross-
sectional occupational studies of perchlorate
plant workers. In both studies, serum tests of
thyroid function revealed no evidence for any
adverse effect of perchlorate. In one study, the
worker population consisted of 35 males and
2 females, 40% of whom had been employed
for more than 5 years; the mean perchlorate
doses absorbed during a single work shift,
based on urinary excretion, were estimated as
4.0, 11, and 34 mg (0.057, 0.16, and 0.48
mg/kg), with values ranging from 0.4 to 69
mg (0.006–0.99 mg/kg) overall (16). In the
other study, the worker population consisted
of 39 males and 9 females with employment
durations of 1–27 years (mean, 8.3 years); the
mean work-shift perchlorate exposure was
estimated as 0.036 mg/kg, with values ranging
from 0.0002 to 0.44 mg/kg overall (17).
In a recent clinical study by Lawrence et
al. (18), inhibition of thyroidal radioiodine
uptake (RAIU) was measured in nine male
volunteers given perchlorate at 10 mg/day in
drinking water for 14 days. In a second study
by the same group, eight male volunteers were
given a dose of 3 mg/day (19). Body-weight
adjusted doses were in the range of
0.089–0.140 mg/kg-day (mean, 0.12 mg/kg-
day) in the 10-mg/day study and 0.033–0.041
mg/kg-day (mean, 0.038 mg/kg-day) in the 3-
mg/day study (20).
The present investigation, conducted
before publication of Lawrence et al.’s 3-
mg/day study (19), was designed to provide
expanded data on the dose response for per-
chlorate inhibition of RAIU in humans and
to obtain pharmacokinetic data. Whereas
Lawrence et al. used a ﬁxed milligram dose in
each person (18,19), we used body-weight-
adjusted doses to provide greater precision.
One important purpose of the present study
was to establish a no-observed-effect level
(NOEL) for perchlorate inhibition of the thy-
roidal uptake of iodide during 2-week expo-
sure. The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (U.S. EPA) deﬁnes the NOEL as “an
exposure level at which there are no statisti-
cally or biologically significant increases in
the frequency or severity of any effect
between the exposed population and its
appropriate control” (21). Here we use the
term NOEL more narrowly to indicate the
highest exposure level tested at which inhibi-
tion of thyroidal iodide uptake is not statisti-
cally or biologically signiﬁcant.
At the time the improved detection
method for perchlorate in aqueous solution
was developed, the toxicologic database on
perchlorate was extremely limited. For exam-
ple, few or no experimental data existed on
the subchronic, reproductive, or develop-
mental toxicity of perchlorate. To ﬁll gaps in
the toxicologic database, eight animal studies
were designed by a consortium that included
the U.S. EPA and the Department of
Defense. The results of those animal studies
were considered by the U.S. EPA in the
development of its 1998 draft risk assessment
for perchlorate (22). The dose response and
time course of the effects of perchlorate in
rats are being elucidated further by additional
studies and data reevaluations, several
designed in response to the external peer-
reviewers’ 1999 report (23) on the U.S.
EPA’s 1998 draft risk assessment. The addi-
tional studies include investigations of per-
chlorate pharmacokinetics, inhibition of
thyroidal iodide uptake, and effects on serum
levels of thyroid hormones and TSH in adult
males, pregnant and nursing females, and, to
a limited extent, fetuses and pups, at doses in
the 0.01–10 mg/kg-day range (24–26). These
data, along with data gathered in the clinical
study reported here, are being used to develop
and validate an interspecies (rat/human),
physiologically based, pharmacokinetic model
(27–31).
Although the physiology of the pituitary-
thyroid axis is very similar in the rat and the
human, the rat thyroid is much more rapidly
responsive to any perturbation of iodine
metabolism leading to decreased thyroid hor-
mone formation (32,33). Thyroid hormone
storage capacity is a major determinant of the
difference in responsiveness. If thyroid hor-
mone synthesis is prevented, the rat thyroid
contains only enough hormone to last a few
days (32,33), whereas the human thyroid has
enough thyroid hormone to last several
months (34,35).
An additional and potentially important
interspecies difference is evidenced by the
rapid up-regulation of thyroidal iodide
uptake in rats in response to multiday treat-
ment with perchlorate, a phenomenon not
observed in humans. In rats, the extent of
inhibition of thyroidal iodide uptake in the
hours following single-dose exposure to per-
chlorate was found to be attenuated over the
course of multiday exposure (24).
In a single-dose experiment, male rats
were injected intravenously with a perchlorate
dose of 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, or 3 mg/kg-day fol-
lowed 2 hr later by intravenous injection of
radioiodine (125I). Group mean values for
thyroidal 125I binding relative to the controls
were reported for the six rats per dose sacri-
ficed at 2, 6, or 9 hr following injection of
125I. The dose response for inhibition of 125I
binding was similar at all three time points.
At the 9-hr sacriﬁce, the extent of inhibition
was statistically signiﬁcant in the 0.1, 1, and 3
mg/kg-day groups (24).
In a multiday experiment, male rats were
exposed to drinking water containing perchlo-
rate at doses of 0, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg-day. On
exposure day 1 (E1), E5, and E14, a total of six
rats per dose were administered 125I by intra-
venous injection and sacriﬁced 2 hr later. The
inhibition of thyroidal 125I uptake (presumably
measured as the bound fraction) observed on
E1 was dose related and much more pro-
nounced at each dose than on E5, when inhibi-
tion was observed only in the 3- and
10-mg/kg-day groups. By E14, inhibition was
observed only in the 10-mg/kg-day group (24).
Additional evidence in rats for rapid
homeostatic adjustment (i.e., up-regulation of
uptake) in response to diminished thyroidal
availability of iodine is provided by a study of
the effects of switching from a high-iodine to
low-iodine diet, the physiologic equivalent of
introducing an inhibitor of iodide uptake.
Following the diet shift, rats exhibited a 50%
increase in radioiodine uptake in 1 day (33).
Evidence that humans lack rapid up-regulation
of thyroidal iodide uptake in response to per-
chlorate comes from the two clinical studies of
Lawrence et al. (18,19), described above. At
the end of 14-day exposure via drinking water,
a dose-related inhibition of uptake was
observed, with statistical signiﬁcance achieved
at the higher dose (mean, 0.12 mg/kg-day).

Given this disparity between rats and humans
in the homeostatic up-regulation response, a
more precise determination of the time course
and dose response for perchlorate inhibition of
thyroidal iodide uptake in humans should be
extremely helpful in evaluating the health risks
of environmental exposures to perchlorate.
In this article we report the results of
radioiodine studies and serum tests of thyroid
function. The results of perchlorate and iodine
analyses in serum and 24-hr urine collected
before and throughout exposure, along with an
evaluation of the extent to which population
variability in the magnitude of the response to
perchlorate is related to iodine nutrition, will
be presented in a separate report.
Materials and Methods
Sample collection and testing. Biological sam-
ples (i.e., whole blood, serum, and urine) were
collected in the Oregon Health & Science
University (OHSU) General Clinical
Research Center (GCRC) by the nursing staff.
All samples other than those to be analyzed
for perchlorate or iodine were processed by
the OHSU Hospital’s Lab Central, which
arranged for testing at the OHSU Hospital’s
Core Lab or a contract laboratory. In the fol-
lowing, analysis at the OHSU Hospital’s Core
Lab is understood unless otherwise speciﬁed.
Dose selection. When designing our study,
we relied upon the observation by Lawrence et
al. (18) that a mean perchlorate dose of 0.12
mg/kg-day inhibits RAIU to about 60% of
baseline. We chose to test doses of 0.02, 0.1,
and 0.5 mg/kg-day to broadly span the effec-
tive inhibitory range, thinking it possible that a
dose of 0.02 mg/kg-day would be a NOEL. By
the time the ﬁrst 14 subjects had been tested at
these three doses, it was clear that 0.02 mg/kg-
day was not a NOEL. Regression analysis of
the E14 uptake relative to baseline for the ﬁrst
14 subjects predicted that a perchlorate dose of
0.007 mg/kg-day would produce no inhibition
of RAIU; this became the fourth dose tested.
Subject screening and informed consent.
During an initial interview, each prospective
subject was given verbal information about
the study’s purpose, exclusionary criteria, and
requirements. At that time we provided the
appropriate consent form and asked the sub-
ject to take it home to review. The two con-
sent forms, one for each protocol, were
approved by the institutional review board at
OHSU, where the study was conducted. Both
forms listed the study’s sponsor and explained
the purpose, procedures, risks and discom-
forts, benefits, alternatives to participation,
confidentiality, compensation provided
($1,200 for the main-study protocol, $650 for
the uptake-study protocol), and the voluntary
nature of participation. The consent form was
signed at the screening visit by the subject, the
principal investigator, and a witness.
The screening visit consisted of a history, a
physical examination, blood sampling (for
complete blood count, routine serum chem-
istry, and serum thyroid function tests), and
urine sampling (for routine urinalysis, screen-
ing for drug abuse, and pregnancy testing for
women who had not had a hysterectomy or
tubal ligation). We excluded candidates if they
had a history of thyroid disease, recent inges-
tion of any iodine-containing pharmaceutical
(including thyroid hormone), or significant
thyroid enlargement. Following one woman’s
enrollment and assignment to the 0.007-
mg/kg-day dose group (uptake study), labora-
tory analysis of her screening-visit blood draw
revealed elevated TSH (18 mIU/L). Because
her thyroid hormone levels and physical
examination were normal, we decided to keep
her in the study to evaluate, in a subject with
subclinical hypothyroidism, the effect of per-
chlorate at a dose predicted to be the NOEL.
All 37 subjects who presented themselves for
the screening visit met the screening criteria
and were entered into the study.
Subject assignment. The ﬁrst 24 subjects
were tested according to our initial (main-
study) protocol and the next 13 subjects
according to our modified (uptake-study)
protocol. We developed the uptake-study
protocol as a means of including additional
subjects with less expenditure of time and
resources than required by the main-study
protocol. The 37 subjects tested according to
one or the other protocol were between 18
and 57 years old (mean ± SD, 38 ± 12 years;
median, 40 years). All enrolled subjects
remained in the study until its termination.
In the main study, four subjects of each
sex received a perchlorate dose of 0.02, 0.1,
or 0.5 mg/kg-day. In the uptake study, six
women and one man received a dose of 0.007
mg/kg-day and one additional subject of each
sex received a dose of 0.02, 0.1, or 0.5
mg/kg-day. Even though we found no statis-
tically signiﬁcant difference between men and
women at the three doses tested in the main
study, when testing the new dose in the
uptake study we opted to concentrate on
women because protecting the developing
fetus is of primary concern.
The logistics of the study were such that
only three subjects could be started each
week. To preclude skewing the dose response
through potential temporal variations in mea-
sured parameters, in the main study we gave
each of the three subjects started each week a
different perchlorate dose (0.02, 0.1, or 0.5
mg/kg-day), deviating from this schedule
only to balance the sexes in each dose group
as necessary. We assigned the ﬁrst three sub-
jects in the uptake study the 0.007 mg/kg-day
dose and thereafter rotated subject enrollment
through the four doses tested (0.007, 0.02,
0.1, and 0.5 mg/kg-day).
Study size. Considering that Lawrence et
al. (18) found highly signiﬁcant inhibition of
uptake in nine subjects given perchlorate at
10 mg/day, a dose approximately the same as
our 0.1 mg/kg-day dose and 4-fold lower
than our 0.5 mg/kg-day dose, we considered
it highly probable that a comparable group
size (8–10 per dose) would yield a signiﬁcant
degree of inhibition at these two doses.
Perchlorate solutions: preparation and
ingestion. Pharmaceutical-grade Perchloracap
capsules, each containing 200 mg potassium
perchlorate (144 mg perchlorate), were
obtained from Mallinckrodt Medical, Inc.
(St. Louis, MO). We emptied the contents of
one or more capsules into a beaker, mixed the
powder with 0.5–1.0 mL lemon juice to
make a slurry, and added sufﬁcient commer-
cial spring water (Crystal Geyser, Mount
Shasta, CA) to make a stock solution contain-
ing 50 mg KClO4/100 mL. We prepared
dosing solutions by appropriate dilution of
the stock solution with spring water to a vol-
ume of 400 mL in a half-liter plastic bottle.
The concentration of perchlorate in some of
the stock solutions and in each subject’s indi-
vidual dosing solution was analyzed and con-
ﬁrmed at the Air Force Research Laboratory
(AFRL; Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
OH). The stock solution samples were found
by AFRL to contain perchlorate at 98% of
the nominal concentration, indicating essen-
tially complete solubility. Samples of the
unadulterated spring water were also analyzed
by AFRL to ensure the absence of perchlorate
contamination. Some of the ﬁller in the cap-
sule was insoluble and remained visible as a
ﬁne white sediment in the stock solution.
We prepared and bottled dosing solu-
tions several times for each subject during
the 14 days of perchlorate administration so
that storage in the subject’s refrigerator
would not be a problem. Subjects were given
two 250-mL clear plastic cups that had been
marked with a horizontal line to indicate the
100-mL level, one to keep at home and one
to leave at work. They were instructed to
drink 100 mL at 0800, 1200, 1600, and
2000 hr on each scheduled perchlorate inges-
tion day and to record the time and volume
of each ingestion on a preprinted log sheet
for additional verification. They were also
instructed to empty the bottle completely
into their 2000 hr aliquot to ensure that the
entire prescribed perchlorate dose was
ingested each day.
Design of the main and uptake studies. In
the clinical evaluation of thyroid function,
measurement of the accumulated thyroidal
radioiodine (i.e., RAIU) at a given time
point integrates the radioiodine uptake at
earlier times. If inhibition of the rate of thy-
roidal iodide uptake was signiﬁcantly greater
at an earlier interval compared with later
Articles • Perchlorate dose response in humans

intervals, this would be reflected in recipro-
cally increased urinary radioiodide excretion
early on, such that less radioiodide would be
available for thyroidal uptake at later inter-
vals. After the rate of uptake becomes
apparent (~2 hr following radioiodine admin-
istration), a mathematical model can be used
to predict the thyroidal radioiodine uptake at
any time during the accumulation period
from a single uptake value measured at any
other time (36,37). This relationship holds
until approximately 24 hr, by which time all
radioiodide has either been taken up by the
thyroid or excreted in the urine. Measurement
at 4–24 hr is more accurate (i.e., the signal-to-
noise ratio is higher) than at times < 4 hr for
two reasons: First, a variable time is required
for radioiodide absorption from the gut into
the bloodstream. Second, at earlier times,
more radioiodide will be in the blood (i.e., not
yet taken up by the thyroid or excreted in the
urine), thereby contributing a higher propor-
tion of the radioactivity measured over the
thyroid and making background correction
for thyroidal uptake less accurate (38). In sub-
jects not undergoing treatment with a thy-
roactive drug, the 3-, 6-, and 8-hr RAIU
values have been found to be highly correlated
with the 24-hr RAIU values (36,37).
Likewise, in subjects treated for 2 weeks with
perchlorate at 10 mg/day, pairwise compari-
son revealed no signiﬁcant differences among
the 4-, 8-, and 24-hr radioiodine uptakes rela-
tive to baseline (20,39). In the present study,
although we expected to find no difference
between the 8- and 24-hr relative uptakes
once a quasi-steady-state equilibrium between
perchlorate absorption and elimination was
established (i.e., in which perchlorate concen-
trations in blood fluctuated with the dosing
schedule in a regular daily pattern, with no
further net perchlorate accumulation over
time), we chose to perform both 8- and 24-hr
uptake measurements primarily because we
were uncertain whether such an equilibrium
would be achieved by E2.
The main study design was as follows:
• Ingestion of 123I at 0900 hr on 4 days: the
baseline visit (1 day before the start of per-
chlorate exposure), E2, E14, and postexpo-
sure day 15 (P15); measurement of RAIU
at 1700 hr on the day of 123I ingestion and
0900 hr the following morning.
• In addition to the blood draw at the screen-
ing visit, a total of 22 blood draws on 11
days throughout the study period of 35
days.
• Collection of 24-hour urine in five pooled
collections on 5 days (the day before the
baseline visit, E1, E2, E8, and P1); collec-
tion of 24-hr pooled urine on 3 days (E14,
P2, and P14); recording the time of urine
collection and the amount of any discarded
urine on a preprinted log sheet.
The uptake study design was as follows:
• Ingestion of 123I at 0900 hr on 3 days: the
baseline visit (1 day before the start of per-
chlorate exposure), E14, and P15. Baseline
visit and E14: measurement of RAIU at
1700 hr on the day of 123I ingestion and
0900 hr the following morning. P15: mea-
surement of RAIU only at 0900 hr on the
day following 123I ingestion.
• In addition to the blood draw at the screen-
ing visit, a blood draw on E8 and on E14.
• Collection of 24-hr pooled urine on the day
before the baseline visit and on E14.
Radioiodine studies. We conducted all
radioiodine studies in the Nuclear Medicine
facility of the OHSU Hospital. 123I capsules
(nominal specific activity, 100 µCi) were
obtained from Mallinckrodt Inc. (Portland,
OR). An Atomlab 950 Thyroid Uptake
System (Biodex Medical Systems, Inc.,
Shirley, NY) was programmed to measure
and record the 123I counts per minute (cpm)
in the capsule just before ingestion (time
zero). The instrument was also programmed
to measure and record the cpm over the thy-
roid, the cpm over the thyroid adjusted for
radioactive decay of the ingested 123I, and the
percentage uptake of the ingested 123I by the
thyroid since time zero. We calibrated the
instrument each day before use.
Thyroid function tests. Analysis of serum
levels of total thyroxine (TT4), free thyroxine
(FT4), total triiodothyronine (TT3), and
TSH was performed by Kaiser Permanente
Regional Laboratory (Portland, OR) and the
results were transmitted electronically to the
OHSU Hospital’s Lab Central on a shared
laboratory software system. Analysis of serum
antibodies to thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) and
thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) was per-
formed by Esoterics Inc. (Calabasas, CA) and
the results were output by the company to a
printer located in OHSU Hospital’s Lab
Central. In the main study, serum TT4,
FT4, TT3, and TSH were analyzed in blood
drawn on 16 occasions: the screening
(unspeciﬁed time) and baseline (0800 hr) vis-
its, E1 (1200 and 1600 hr), E2 (0800, 1200,
and 1700 hr), E3 (0900 hr), E4 (0800 and
1200 hr), E8 (0900 hr), E14 (0800, 1200,
and 1700 hr), P1 (0900 hr), and P15 (0900
hr). In the uptake study, these hormones were
analyzed only in blood drawn at the screening
visit (unspecified time) and on E14 (0800
hr). Serum Anti-TPO levels were measured in
blood drawn at the screening visit and on P15
for all subjects in the main study. We likewise
ordered analysis of serum anti-Tg in the same
two samples, but the lab reported anti-Tg
results in both samples for only eight main-
study subjects and in the P15 sample alone
for the remaining 16 main-study subjects and
one uptake-study subject (the woman with
abnormally elevated TSH).
Serum chemistry and hematology.
Measurement of serum thyroxine-binding
globulin (TBG) was performed by Esoterics
Inc. and the results were transmitted to
OHSU in the same manner as the antibody
data. In the main study, a serum chemistry
panel (analysis of sodium, potassium, calcium,
chloride, total CO2, glucose, urea nitrogen,
total bilirubin, albumin, TBG, total protein,
creatinine, aspartate transaminase, and alka-
line phosphatase) and a complete blood count
(including differential) were performed on
blood samples drawn at the screening visit and
on E2, E14, and P15. We also requested
analysis of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in
the same samples, but the test was inadver-
tently omitted from the serum chemistry
panel until midway through the study; only
16 main-study subjects were tested for ALT at
one or more scheduled time points. In the
uptake study, the above tests (excluding analy-
sis of TBG) were performed only in blood
samples drawn at the screening visit.
Statistical analysis. We analyzed data
using standard statistical techniques, including
linear regression and correlation analysis to
reveal regression slopes and correlation coefﬁ-
cients (r values). To the extent possible, RAIU
data from the main and uptake studies were
combined. When analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used to investigate the dose
dependence of outcome variables, dose was
entered as a categorical variable. For pairwise
comparisons with baseline values, we used the
two-tailed t-test for dependent samples and
the nonparametric Wilcoxon matched pairs
test. All statistical analyses were run on
Statistica (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK). Our selected
criterion for statistical significance was p <
0.05; however, we also report all p values <
0.1. Results are given as mean ± SE (or regres-
sion ﬁt ± SE) unless otherwise indicated.
Quality assurance/quality control. At the
request of the U.S. EPA, the study data
were subjected to an intensive quality assur-
ance/quality control (QA/QC) audit by out-
side auditors. The RAIU data were audited by
M. G. Schneider under the management of
the AFRL. All study data other than the RAIU
data were audited by Toxicology/Regulatory
Services, Inc. (TRS; Charlottesville, VA) under
the management of Toxicology Excellence for
Risk Assessment (Cincinnati, OH). The TRS
audit led to the discovery of five FT4 data
points that had been entered into the database
in error. All results reported in this article
reﬂect the database corrected to exclude these
ﬁve data points, as described by the study co-
investigator (G.G.) in her written response to
the TRS QA/QC audit report of 11 April
2001. The audit reports prepared by Schneider
and by TRS (and the co-investigator’s response
to the TRS report) were submitted to the
U.S. EPA by the audit managers.

Thyroidal radioiodine uptake. As expected,
given its 13-hr half-life, no 123I was detectable
in the thyroid just before administration of
any subsequent 123I dose.
Baseline uptake. Thyroidal radioiodine
uptake at baseline varied widely among sub-
jects: 5.6–25.4% for the 8-hr uptake and
9.8–33.7% for the 24-hr uptake. Our find-
ings concerning the relationship between the
baseline uptake and the 24-hr urinary iodine
(UI) excretion will be described elsewhere.
Effect of perchlorate ingestion. Table 1
gives descriptive statistics for the 8- and 24-hr
raw uptakes (expressed as a percentage of
ingested 123I) and the 8- and 24-hr relative
uptakes (expressed as a percentage of the base-
line uptake). The suppression of radioiodine
uptake was linearly related to the logarithm
of perchlorate dose. Pairwise comparison
revealed no statistically significant differ-
ence between the suppression of radioiodine
uptake on E2 and E14 at either 8 or 24 hr
after radioiodine administration (p > 0.7),
indicating the achievement of quasi-steady-
state inhibition by E2 and the absence of a
cumulative effect. Figure 1 shows the rela-
tionship between the 24-hr relative uptakes
on E2 and E14 for all subjects (and doses)
tested at both time points (r = 0.824, n =
24); we observed a similar relationship for
the 8-hr relative uptakes on E2 and E14 (r =
0.782, n = 24). Regression analysis of the 8-
and 24-hr relative uptakes (RU8 and RU24)
against the logarithm of the perchlorate
dose (D) in mg/kg-day yielded Equations
1A and 1B for E2 and Equations 1C and
1D for E14:
(RU8)E2 = (–0.374 ± 0.041) log10D
+ (0.209 ± 0.047) [1A]
(RU24)E2 = (–0.373 ± 0.041) log10D
+ (0.202 ± 0.047) [1B]
(RU8)E14 = (–0.337 ± 0.037) log10D
+ (0.229 ± 0.052) [1C]
(RU24)E14 = (–0.359 ± 0.034) log10D
+ (0.213 ± 0.048) [1D]
In Equations 1A–1D, the intercept is the regres-
sion-model prediction of the relative uptake
when the perchlorate dose is exactly 1 mg/kg-
day (log10D = 0). Analysis of the correlation of
(RU8)E2, (RU24)E2, (RU8)E14, and (RU24)E14
with log10D yielded correlation coefﬁcients of
–0.888 (n = 24), –0.889 (n = 24), –0.844 (n =
36), and –0.870 (n = 37), respectively.
The lowest dose producing no statistically
significant inhibition of uptake was 0.007
mg/kg-day (Table 1). Thus, in this study,
0.007 mg/kg-day (7 µg/kg-day) was a NOEL
for inhibition of RAIU. To achieve a more
refined estimate of the true no-effect level
(NEL), we extrapolated from the E14 regres-
sion relationships for RU8 and RU24
(Equations 1C and 1D). We used the E14
data and not the E2 data in the extrapolation
because the 7-µg/kg-day dose group (along
with the other uptake-study subjects) had no
uptake measurement on E2. With (RU8)E14
and (RU24)E14 set equal to 1.00 (equivalent to
0% inhibition of uptake) in Equations 1C and
1D, the predicted dose values corresponding to
the true NEL are 5.19 and 6.40 µg/kg-day
(0.36 and 0.45 mg/day in a 70-kg person),
respectively. With (RU8)E14 and (RU24)E14 set
equal to 0.95, 0.90, 0.85, or 0.80 (equivalent
to 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20% inhibition of
uptake), Equation 1C predicts dose values of
7.29, 10.3, 14.4, and 20.3 µg/kg-day (0.51,
0.72, 1.0, and 1.4 mg/day in a 70-kg person),
respectively, and Equation 1D predicts dose
values of 8.82, 12.2, 16.8, and 23.1 µg/kg-day
(0.62, 0.85, 1.2, and 1.6 mg/day in a 70-kg
person), respectively. Plugging the predicted
dose values corresponding to uptake inhibition
of 0–20% back into the regression model, we
derived 95% upper confidence limits on
uptake inhibition (Table 2).
We also used Equations 1C and 1D to pro-
vide estimates of the 50% inhibitory dose
(ID50). With (RU8)E14 and (RU24)E14 set equal
to 0.5 (equivalent to 50% inhibition of uptake),
Equations 1C and 1D predict dose values of
0.157 and 0.159 mg/kg-day (11.0 and 11. 1
mg/day in a 70-kg person), respectively.
Although an asymptotic ﬂattening of the log-
linear dose response is expected with increasing
dose, a lower limit on the 100% inhibitory dose
(ID100) can be estimated by assuming linearity
at doses beyond the measurement range. With
(RU8)E14 and (RU24)E14 set equal to 0 (equiva-
lent to 100% inhibition of uptake), Equations
1C and 1D predict dose values of 4.76 and 3.92
mg/kg-day (333 and 274 mg/day in a 70-kg
person), respectively.
Recovery from perchlorate ingestion. On
P15, the 8- and 24-hr uptakes were statisti-
cally indistinguishable from their respective
baseline uptakes (p > 0.4 by pairwise compar-
ison), indicating complete recovery from the
inhibitory effect of perchlorate. The mean
(±SE) 8-hr uptakes relative to baseline were
111.7 ± 8.1%, 103.5 ± 10.4%, and 107.7 ±
11.3% in the 0.02-, 0.1-, and 0.5-mg/kg-day
dose groups, respectively. The mean (±SE)
24-hr uptakes relative to baseline were 100.3
± 8.4%, 105.3 ± 5.5%, 106.6 ± 9.1%, and
104.6 ± 9.4% in the 0.007-, 0.02-, 0.1-, and
0.5-mg/kg-day dose groups, respectively.

on E14, and on P15 for each individual sub-
ject in each dose group. The woman with

elevated TSH at the screening visit had a 24-
hr uptake of 10% at the baseline visit, the
lowest value observed in her dose group
(0.007 mg/kg-day) or any group. Her 24-hr
uptake was 13.9% on E14, or 139% of base-
line (Figure 2D). Her case illustrates a general
phenomenon in the reporting of uptake as a
percentage of baseline: For subjects with low
baseline uptake, small changes in absolute
uptake, up or down, appear large in terms of
relative uptake. Figure 3 shows the mean 24-
hr uptake as a percentage of baseline for each
dose group on each measurement day.
Effect of sex. In a two-way model testing
the effect of sex and dose on the uptake rela-
tive to baseline for each of the six postbaseline
measurements (8- and 24-hr uptakes on E2,
E14, and P15), ANOVA revealed no effect of
sex for any measurement (p > 0.4). Similarly,
two-way ANOVA revealed no effect of sex on
the 8- and 24-hr raw uptakes at the baseline
visit (p > 0.7) or on E2, E14, or P15 (p > 0.3).
Table 3 gives summary statistics for the raw
and relative 24-hr uptakes by sex and dose; we
found similar results for the 8-hr uptakes. We
calculated the power of the study to detect a
20% difference between males and females in
the uptake relative to baseline. The highest
power values were found for E2: 83% and
95% for the respective 8-hr and 24-hr mea-
surements in the 0.5-mg/kg-day dose group
and 99% for the 8-hr measurement in the
0.1-mg/kg-day dose group.
Correlation of 8- and 24-hr uptakes and
relative uptakes. Over all measurement days
and dose groups, the 8- and 24-hr uptakes
were linearly related (r = 0.975, n = 121).
Linear regression analysis yielded the equation:
U24 = (1.40 ± 0.03)U8
+ (0.013 ± 0.003) [2]
Pairwise comparison of the U24/U8 ratio at
baseline with the U24/U8 ratios for measure-
ments made during perchlorate administration
(E2 and E14 combined) or on P15 revealed no
signiﬁcant difference, indicating that the ratio
is independent of perchlorate treatment. The
8- and 24-hr relative uptakes for E2, E14, and
P15 combined were likewise linearly related (r
= 0.967, n = 84). Figure 4 shows the relation-
ship between the 8- and 24-hr relative uptakes
on E14 for each dose group.
In a 1951 investigation by Greer (37) of
euthyroid subjects under basal conditions and
after treatment with various doses of thyroid
hormone to suppress TSH secretion, the U24
versus U8 regression slope was 1.43 ± 0.02 (n
= 75). The similarity of the regression slopes
observed in the 1951 study (37) and the pre-
sent study is remarkable given the differences
in basal radioiodine uptake and treatment.
The mean basal 24-hr uptake in the present
study was approximately half that observed in
the 1951 study (37), presumably reﬂecting a
higher dietary iodine intake in the current
U.S. population. The nature of the suppres-
sion of thyroid function in the two studies
was also different; perchlorate, at the doses
given, suppresses only iodide transport,
whereas thyroid hormone, at doses sufﬁcient
to decrease TSH secretion, suppresses almost
all aspects of thyroid function.
Comparison with uptake results of
Lawrence et al. Whereas we tested body-
weight adjusted doses in the present study, the
above-described studies by Lawrence et al.
(18,19) tested doses unadjusted for body
weight. To facilitate comparison with the per-
chlorate inhibition of thyroidal RAIU observed
in our study, we obtained body weights (20)
for all subjects in the two studies performed by
Lawrence et al. (18,19) and calculated a body
weight-adjusted dose for each subject. For each
E14 uptake measurement in the three studies,
we calculated an effect parameter (analogous to
the slope of the dose–response relationship) by
dividing the uptake as a percentage of baseline
by the logarithm of the body-weight-adjusted
dose. Using a nonparametric test sensitive to
the shapes of distributions (Kolmogorov-
Smirnov), we found signiﬁcant differences (p <
0.01) in the effect parameter for both the 8-
and 24-hr uptakes when we compared the data
from our study with the combined data from
the other two studies. Figure 5A shows the 24-
hr uptake on E14 as a function of perchlorate
dose for each subject in the present study and
the two studies by Lawrence et al. (18,19).

aData are based on regression models describing the 8-hr (Equation 1C) and 24-hr (Equation 1D) uptake data for E14. First
we used each model to predict the perchlorate dose corresponding to a given level of inhibition of iodide uptake. Using
the same models but with dose as the independent variable, we then derived conﬁdence limits on the inhibition of iodide
uptake at those doses.

Lawrence et al. (18,19) performed the ﬁnal
RAIU 2 weeks after perchlorate withdrawal (on
P14) and found a statistically signiﬁcant over-
shoot relative to baseline at both doses tested.
We performed the final RAIU 2 weeks after
perchlorate withdrawal (on P15) and found no
statistically signiﬁcant overshoot in any dose
group. Figure 5B shows the 24-hr uptake at 2
weeks postexposure as a function of perchlorate
dose for each subject in all three studies.
Perchlorate elimination rate. Analysis of
urinary excretion data from a 1929 study in an
adult man given a single oral perchlorate dose
of 1.4 g (40) revealed that > 90% of the
ingested perchlorate was removed with a half-
life (t1/2) of 7.7 hr (39). In the present study,
we calculated the rate of perchlorate elimina-
tion from levels in serum following perchlorate
withdrawal. For the eight main-study subjects
in the 0.5-mg/kg-day dose group, t1/2 values
ranged from 6.0 to 9.3 hr (average, 8.1 hr).
Fewer data points were available for the 0.1-
mg/kg-day subjects because levels fell more
rapidly below the analytical detection limit of
5 ppb after perchlorate withdrawal. Serum lev-
els in the 0.02-mg/kg-day dose group were
almost entirely below detection throughout the
exposure period. Additional data and analysis
pertaining to serum and urine perchlorate
measurements (as well as serum and urine
iodine measurements) will be reported else-
where. The perchlorate measurements on our
subjects’ serum and urine samples were per-
formed by AFRL scientists, who have pre-
sented some of the data previously (29–31).
Serum hormones (FT4, TT4, TT3, and
TSH). Effect of perchlorate ingestion. TSH,
FT4, TT4, and TT3 levels throughout the
study were in the normal range for all subjects
except one woman in the 0.007-mg/kg-day
dose group (uptake study) who had abnor-
mally high TSH (18 and 15 mIU/L) on both
occasions at which the hormone was mea-
sured (screening visit and E14, respectively).
Table 4 presents summary statistics for serum
hormones measured at all blood draw events
in the main study.
Because only limited data were available
for uptake-study subjects, we conﬁned evalua-
tion of the effect of perchlorate exposure on
serum hormones to the 24 subjects in the main
study. To facilitate our initial statistical analy-
sis, we deﬁned a categorical exposure variable
(before, during, and after perchlorate) and a
categorical dose variable (high, middle, and
low). Two-way ANOVA applied to the expo-
sure and dose variables revealed no signiﬁcant
dependence of any serum hormone on the
exposure variable. By chance, the 0.5-mg/kg-
day group had significantly higher baseline-
visit TSH levels than did the 0.1-mg/kg-day
group (p < 0.014, t-test for independent sam-
ples). Similarly, the 0.5-mg/kg-day group had
signiﬁcantly higher screening-visit (p < 0.046)
and marginally higher baseline-visit (p <
0.058) TT3 levels than did the 0.02-mg/kg-
day group. The disparity in pre-exposure val-
ues skewed the comparison of TSH and TT3
across dose groups. To eliminate the problem
of intergroup differences in pre-exposure
serum hormone values and elucidate any possi-
ble effects of perchlorate, we performed one-
way ANOVA for each dose group separately,
once against the exposure variable and once
against blood-draw event (16 draws between
the screening visit and P15). The results
revealed no association of FT4, TT4, or TT3
with blood-draw event in any dose group.
However, we found a marginally significant
association of TSH with blood-draw event in
the 0.5-mg/kg-day dose group (p = 0.09).
Inﬂuence of circadian variation. To elim-
inate any potential dampening of the above
association by circadian variation in TSH
levels, we deﬁned a time-of-day variable with
three categories: morning (before 1030 hr),
mid-day (1030–1359 hr), and late afternoon
(1400 hr or later); these categories refer to the
recorded time of each blood draw, not the
target (nominal) time. ANOVA performed
separately within each dose group for each
time-of-day category (a total of 3 × 3 = 9
analyses) yielded a significant relationship
between TSH and blood-draw event only in
the morning draws of the 0.5-mg/kg-day dose
group (p = 0.03). Figure 6 shows the distribu-
tion of TSH for each blood-draw event in the
0.5-mg/kg-day dose group, categorized
according to the time-of-day variable. The
data suggest an overall downward trend dur-
ing exposure with recovery by P15.
Analysis of the dependence of FT4, TT4,
and TT3 on blood-draw event (ANOVA per-
formed separately within each dose group for
each time-of-day category) indicated that TT3
was signiﬁcantly related to blood-draw event in
the late-afternoon draws of subjects in the 0.1-
mg/kg-day dose group (p = 0.03). However,
the effect appears to be attributable to the fact
that two of the screening-visit draws for the
0.1-mg/kg-day group fell into the late-after-
noon category and both happened to be low

with respective TT3 values of 80 and 84
ng/dL at the screening visit, TT3 values on
E1, E2, and E14 were 92, 91, and 95 ng/dL
in the first subject and 100, 99, and 112
ng/dL in the second. TT3 levels in the 0.5-
mg/kg-day dose group were independent of
blood-draw event in every time-of-day cate-
gory (p > 0.7). Consideration of all the avail-
able data does not suggest an effect of
perchlorate on TT3 in this study.
Serum anti-Tg and anti-TPO. Serum
anti-Tg levels were below detection (< 40
IU/mL) in all samples tested. Levels of anti-
TPO were above normal (> 20 IU/mL) in two
subjects. One was a 56-year-old male in the
0.02-mg/kg-day group whose anti-TPO levels
at the screening visit and on P15 were 63 and
59 IU/mL, respectively. The other was the pre-
viously mentioned 49-year-old female in the
0.007-mg/kg-day group with elevated TSH.
Her screening-visit anti-TPO level was 75
IU/mL; she was not tested a second time. Both
subjects were clinically euthyroid, and their
other thyroid function test results remained
within normal limits throughout the study.
Serum chemistry and hematology. Serum
chemistry and hematology results were within
normal limits throughout the study in all sub-
jects. We found no signiﬁcant change in any
of these parameters during or after perchlo-
rate administration.
Discussion
Interpretation of the estimated true NEL for
inhibition of uptake. In this study, 0.007
mg/kg-day (7 µg/kg-day) was the NOEL for
inhibition of thyroidal RAIU. We estimated
true NEL values of 5.2 and 6.4 µg/kg-day
based on the dose–response for inhibition of
the respective 8-hr (n = 36) and 24-hr (n = 37)
RAIU on E14 in all subjects tested, one with
subclinical autoimmune hypothyroidism, the
rest euthyroid. Based on the variability
observed in these subjects, there is a 95% prob-
ability that thyroidal iodide uptake will be
inhibited by no more than 8.3–9.5% at a dose
of 5.2–6.4 µg/kg-day. We expect that inhibi-
tion of thyroidal iodide uptake by 9.5% would
be physiologically insigniﬁcant in persons with
sufﬁcient iodine intake. Indeed, observations in
iodine-sufﬁcient perchlorate plant workers (dis-
cussed below) lead us to conclude that perchlo-
rate exposure at levels associated with a
relatively high percentage inhibition of thy-
roidal iodide uptake produces no adverse health
consequences in such individuals.
Assuming a body weight of 70 kg and a
drinking-water intake of 2 L/day, a perchlo-
rate dose of 5.2 or 6.4 µg/kg-day would be
consumed if drinking-water supplies con-
tained perchlorate at a concentration of
approximately 180 or 220 µg/L (ppb),
respectively. Thus, assuming that the drink-
ing-water supply is the only signiﬁcant source
of exposure to perchlorate or other inhibitors
of the thyroidal uptake of iodide, a perchlo-
rate concentration of 180–220 ppb (and pos-
sibly much higher) should be of no health
concern in iodine-sufﬁcient populations.
Interpretation of serum hormone results.
Despite significant inhibition of thyroidal
radioiodine uptake in the 0.02, 0.1, and 0.5
mg/kg-day dose groups by respective average
values of 17%, 44%, and 67%, we found no
change in serum levels of thyroid hormones
(i.e., FT4, TT4, or TT3). We observed a sig-
niﬁcant effect of perchlorate on serum levels
of TSH only in the 0.5-mg/kg-day dose
group: a downward trend in morning (before
1030 hr) blood draws during perchlorate
exposure, with recovery by P15. Our ﬁndings
of no effect on thyroid hormones or TSH
during 2-week perchlorate exposure at a dose
of 0.1 or 0.02 mg/kg-day agree with those of
Lawrence et al. (18,19), who reported no
change in thyroid hormones or TSH during
2-week exposure at a mean dose of 0.12 or
0.038 mg/kg-day. Our ﬁnding of marginally
decreased TSH levels during 2-week perchlo-
rate exposure at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg-day is
reminiscent of the signiﬁcant TSH depression
observed in five subjects who ingested
perchlorate at a dose of 900 mg/day (~13
mg/kg-day) for 4 weeks (35).
A downward trend in TSH is the reverse
of what is expected when iodide uptake is
blocked or iodine nutrition is insufficient
(41). If iodine deﬁciency is severe enough and
sufficiently prolonged to compromise ade-
quate production and secretion of thyroid
hormones, TSH secretion is increased
because of decreased negative feedback of thy-
roid hormones on the hypothalamic–pituitary
control centers. We have no explanation for
the slight decrease in TSH observed during
exposure to perchlorate at 0.5 mg/kg-day (the
present study) or a higher dose (35).
Subjects in the 0.02-, 0.1-, and 0.5-
mg/kg-day dose groups experienced partial
inhibition of thyroidal iodide uptake for 14
days; the absence of an effect on serum thy-
roid hormones is expected given any extent of
inhibition lasting only a few weeks. For a sim-
pliﬁed view of the relevant dynamics, consider
the following: The human thyroid gland con-
tains a huge reserve store of hormone within
the intrafollicular thyroglobulin. Under
iodine-replete conditions, the iodine content
of the human thyroid gland averages 0.5% of
wet weight, or 100 mg for a 20-g thyroid
(32). Approximately 46% (46 mg) of the
iodine in thyroglobulin is in the form of
iodothyronines. T4 is 65% iodine; if all stored
iodothyronine were T4, there would be 71 mg
of stored T4. The typical oral replacement
dose of T4 in a hypothyroid individual is 0.1
mg/day. Assuming a constant secretion rate of
0.1 mg T4 daily, no conversion to T3, and
complete inhibition of thyroidal iodide
uptake, the quantity of stored hormone
should be sufﬁcient to last for over a year. In
fact, 20% of the iodothyronine in thyroglobu-
lin is T3 (34). Given that T3 is only 58%
iodine but has four times the potency of T4,
the quantity of stored hormone should be suf-
ﬁcient to last an even longer period. Because
the rate of secretion is proportional to the
amount stored in the thyroid gland (42,43),
blood levels of thyroid hormone would drop
continuously during the entire time that thy-
roidal iodide uptake is completely blocked,
although it should take several weeks or longer
for this decrease to become detectable.
Consistency with the uptake results of
Lawrence et al. We noted small but signifi-
cant differences in the response to perchlorate
observed in our study compared with that
observed by Lawrence et al. (18,19) in their
two studies. In our study there was more
inhibition of radioiodide uptake for a given
dose of perchlorate. Although there were
small interstudy differences in baseline
uptake, these differences cannot account for
the observed discrepancy in the response to
perchlorate. The most likely explanation is
that the different exposure regimens (four
times daily in our study; ad libitum in the
studies by Lawrence et al.) led to different
temporal patterns in blood levels of perchlo-
rate. We hypothesize that in the ad libitum
studies, the subjects tended to drink dispro-
portionately large fractions of their dosing

solutions just before their scheduled clinic
visits, leading to higher perchlorate concen-
trations in sampled blood, higher peak
concentrations, faster excretion, and lower
time-averaged concentrations compared to
subjects drinking perchlorate at four pre-
scribed times throughout the day. Whereas
blood sampled in the ad libitum studies
might reﬂect recent ingestion of a dispropor-
tionate amount of the daily perchlorate dose,
the 24-hr RAIU measurements in both stud-
ies must reflect perchlorate levels averaged
over the entire 24-hr accumulation period.
Our temporal hypothesis is supported by the
observation that in the 10-mg/day ad libi-
tum study, significantly greater inhibition
was revealed by the 4-hr RAIU than by the
24-hr measurement (20,39). It is also sup-
ported by the observation that serum per-
chlorate levels measured in the 10-mg/day
(mean, 0.12 mg/kg-day) ad libitum study
were much higher than the values measured
in our study at a comparable dose. In the
10-mg/day ad libitum study, mean serum
perchlorate concentrations in samples taken at
unspecified times on E7 and E14 were 0.61
and 0.59 µg/mL, respectively (18). In our 0.1-
mg/kg-day dose group, mean serum perchlo-
rate concentrations in the single (morning)
sampling event on E8 and the three (morning,
noon, and late afternoon) sampling events on
E14 were 0.10–0.17 µg/mL; our 0.5-mg/kg-
day dose group had mean serum perchlorate
concentrations of 0.45–0.85 µg/mL at the
same four time points (data not shown). The

was 1313 hr ± 24 min. The BV blood draw was nominally at 0800 hr; the E3, E8, P1, and P15 blood draws were nominally at 0900 hr.
study’s 0.5-mg/kg-day dose group span those
observed in subjects given a 4-fold lower dose in
the 10-mg/day ad libitum study. Note that
interlaboratory variability can be excluded as an
explanation for the discrepancy because in both
cases the perchlorate analyses were performed by
the AFRL. In a separate article we will address at
greater length the issue of temporal effects
related to the observed interstudy differences.
Lawrence et al. (18,19) found that the thy-
roidal radioiodine uptake measured 2 weeks
postexposure was signiﬁcantly elevated relative
to the baseline uptake. We did not observe a
significant postexposure overshoot in the
present study, nor was one seen in six subjects
given perchlorate at a dose of 144 mg/day for
7 days (44). In the latter study, measurement
of baseline thyroidal radioiodine uptake imme-
diately preceded the start of perchlorate
administration and repeat uptake measure-
ments were performed at 2, 4, 7, and 14 days
postexposure; the results showed that the mean
uptake returned to the baseline value within
2–4 days. Therefore, we consider it likely that
the postexposure overshoot in radioiodine
uptake observed by Lawrence et al. was a con-
sequence of chance variability or some other
factor unrelated to perchlorate exposure.
Inhibition of uptake in iodine insuffi-
ciency. It is difﬁcult to say what level of thy-
roidal iodide uptake inhibition (if any) would
be nonadverse in a person with any particular
degree of iodine insufﬁciency.
The third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) (45),
conducted in 1988–1994, found that the
percentages of males and females with urinary
iodine (UI) concentrations below 5 µg/dL
were substantially higher in every age category
than in the 1971–1974 survey. Although the
NHANES III data reveal a major decline in
iodine intake over a 25-year period, we do
not believe that iodine insufﬁciency should be
inferred. The NHANES data were obtained
from single spot urines. In comparison with
the population distribution of UI based on a
1-year average of monthly spot urines, the
distribution based on single spot urines is
much broader, leading to overestimation of
the number of individuals at both the low
and high ends (46). Although single spot
urines are a convenient means for obtaining
crude information about iodine nutrition in a
population, gauging the adequacy of iodine
intake in an individual requires collection of
one or more 24-hr urines (47,48). The
NHANES III investigators fully appreciated
that it was not possible for them to deter-
mine, based on their spot-urine results alone,
whether thyroid function was adversely
affected in any members of the population as
a result of insufﬁcient iodine nutrition (45):
“Whether the reduced UI seen in 1988–1994
can be directly correlated to measurable
changes in thyroid function in the population
is not known at this time because the results
of thyroid function tests and thyroid antibod-
ies in the 1988–1994 study are not available
as yet.” They went on to say that “We know
of no population-based study in the United
States, such as transient neonatal hypothy-
roidism or recent goiter surveys, that has
shown changes that resulted from decreased
iodine intake.” The decline in iodine nutrition
in the 25 years before 1988–1994 also brought
a substantial reduction in the percentage of the
population with excessive iodine intake. The
investigators noted (45): “In 1971–1974,
27.8% of the population had excessive UI con-
centrations (> 50 µg/dL), and the decline of
those with excessive UI to 5.3% in 1988–1994
may be seen as beneﬁcial in possibly reducing
diseases due to iodine excess such as
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and perhaps Graves’
disease.” In the United States as elsewhere, if
iodine insufficiency occurs in any person or
population group, then it should be corrected
by iodine supplementation. Such supplementa-
tion should occur irrespective of whether there
is signiﬁcant known exposure to environmental
perchlorate, other inhibitors of the sodium-
iodide symporter such as nitrate and thiocyanate
(49), or foods that naturally contain antithyroid
compounds or their precursors (41).
Protection against depressed thyroid func-
tion in perchlorate plant workers. The aver-
age perchlorate absorption in workers
subjected to the highest exposure has been
estimated as 34 mg/shift, or approximately
0.5 mg/kg-day (16). In our study, a perchlo-
rate dose of 0.5 mg/kg-day inhibited uptake
by 67% on average. The fact that studies of
chronically exposed perchlorate plant workers
have thus far failed to detect any abnormali-
ties of thyroid function (16,17) may well be
attributable to high daily intake of iodine
among the workers. If iodine intake is suffi-
ciently high, even an average reduction in
thyroidal iodide concentration to one-third
its former level may still leave these individu-
als sufficient iodide to produce thyroid hor-
mone at a normal rate. Further, given that
perchlorate has a half-life of about 8 hr, the
perchlorate plant workers, many of whom
worked 12-hr shifts, might recover from the
inhibitory effects of exposure during off-shift
periods. Thus, the discontinuous nature of
occupational exposure, which resembles the
discontinuous nature of drinking-water expo-
sure, might be a major factor in the observed
tolerance to long-term perchlorate exposure at
levels capable of producing pronounced inhi-
bition of uptake. Prolonged exposure to per-
chlorate may also lead to an adaptive increase
in the efﬁciency of thyroidal iodide uptake.
Although it has been argued, on the basis
of data from a very small group of subjects,
that serum TSH is lowest in persons whose
iodine nutrition falls within certain narrow
limits (50), normal TSH levels are typically
observed over a wide range of iodine intake.
A study of 2,300 euthyroid subjects found
that serum TSH levels were statistically indis-
tinguishable among groups with single-sam-
ple UI concentrations of 51–100, 101–200,
and 201–300 µg/g creatinine; only the group

with UI < 50 µg/g creatinine had signiﬁcantly
higher serum TSH levels compared to the
other groups (51). Further, iodine deﬁciency
must be relatively severe to produce any clear
clinical or laboratory signs of abnormally low
thyroid function (41).
Humans are able to maintain normal thy-
roid function when exposed to relatively high
levels of the iodide uptake inhibitor thiocyanate
(e.g., from consumption of cassava or cabbage);
the prevalence of goiter is not elevated as long
as the iodine/thiocyanate ratio in urine is above
a critical threshold of approximately 3 µg
iodine per 1 mg thiocyanate (41). Taking into
consideration the relative molecular weights of
perchlorate and thiocyanate and the fact that
perchlorate is about 20-fold more potent an
inhibitor of thyroidal iodide uptake (52),
extrapolation from this guideline for the
iodine/thiocyanate ratio suggests that ingestion
of 36 µg iodine per 1 mg perchlorate should be
sufﬁcient to avoid goiter. Based on this crude
calculation, 150 µg iodine daily would protect
against goiter in a person whose perchlorate
ingestion is 4 mg/day (0.057 mg/kg-day in a
70-kg adult), a dose that would inhibit iodide
uptake by approximately 35%, according to the
dose–response we observed in the present
study. It is not clear what ratio of iodine to per-
chlorate is necessary to protect against effects
on thyroid function more subtle than goiter,
but from the observations on thiocyanate, it
can be inferred that adequate iodine intake is
key to the resiliency of the thyroid–pituitary
axis when challenged with perchlorate or any
other inhibitor of thyroidal iodide uptake.
