Abstract
The lysosomal storage diseases, such as Gaucher’s disease,
mucopolysaccharidosis I, II and IV, Fabry’s disease, and Pompe’s
disease, are rare inherited disorders whose symptoms result from
enzyme deficiency causing lysosomal accumulation. Until
effective gene-replacement therapy is developed, expensive, and
at best incomplete, enzyme-replacement therapy is the only hope
for sufferers of rare lysosomal storage diseases. Preventive
strategies involving carrier detection should be a priority toward
the successful management of these conditions.
The onset of the molecular biology revolution in the 1970s
created a tsunami of optimism in biological and clinical
circles. Sydney Brenner has described the excitement of
basic biologists for whom the new technology offered the
opportunity to gather important genetic data in days
instead of the weeks or years that were required by the old
mating and phenotype technologies [1]. Clinical investi­
gators were equally thrilled with the promise that the new
biology might lead to complete correction of genetic
diseases for which only partial replacement therapies such
as insulin and blood transfusion were then available. We
outlined the advent and progress of gene therapy in a
previous column [2], in which we emphasized the very
slow progress of that field, one that has only recently begun
to bear fruit.
Dissatisfied with the frustrations surrounding the medical
application of gene-replacement therapies, clinical investi­
gators traveled alternative routes. The first, intact cell
therapy utilizing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HST)
was at the start slow to be accepted, but has become
standard treatment. The field was made possible by the
pioneering work of E Donnell Thomas and his associates,
for which Thomas received a Nobel Prize in medicine and
physiology. The first applications of HST were devoted to
management of acutely fatal hematopoietic malignancies
and marrow failure, but as confidence accumulated in the
suppression of graft versus host disease, non-malignant
hematopoietic diseases became justifiable targets [3-6].
The treatment of Diamond-Blackfan anemia, Wiskott-
Aldrich syndrome and thalassemia by HST has been
particularly successful. Though the treatment is largely
restricted to the 25% of patients with compatible sibling
donors, unrelated histocompatible donors have been
increasingly utilized with improving results, and,
surprisingly, acceptable results have also been observed
with haplo-identical donors [7-11].
Successful gene-replacement treatment has been most
frequently reported in the inherited immunodeficiencies
[2], but, despite promising murine studies [12-14], there
have been no published reports of successful long-term
treatment of inherited disorders of myeloid stem cells in
humans by gene insertion. Attempts to create corrected
stem cells from somatic cells (so-called induced pluripotent
stem or IPS cells) have also been effective in murine
models of sickle cell anemia in vivo [15] and in human
thalassemia in vitro [16]. These approaches, while
fascinating, are quite far from clinical trials.
The lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are obvious targets
of both HST and gene-replacement therapy. Gaucher’s
disease is an excellent and the most frequent example. It is
a disorder in which acid beta glucosidase (glucocerebro­
sidase)-deficient macrophages loaded with excess gluco­
sylceramide accumulate throughout the reticulo­endo­thelial
system and particularly disrupt the functions of the bones,
liver, and spleen, and, in some forms, the brain. The
disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, and
more than 200 various polymorphisms and disease-causing
mutations have been reported. Though considerably more
frequent among Ashkenazi Jews, the disease is widely
distributed. The commonest cause (type 1) is an Asn370Ser
point mutation in acid beta glucosidase, but even patients
homozygous for this mutation have highly variable pheno­
types, presumably due to genetic and epigenetic modifiers.
They do not, however, have central nervous system
manifes­tations, presumably because this mutation does
not cause complete loss of enzyme activity. In contrast, the

Leu444Pro mutation causes complete loss of enzyme
function and is associated with central nervous system
disease (types 2 and 3) [17].
HST from a histocompatible sibling donor was first
attempted for Gaucher’s disease by Rappeport and Ginns
in 1984 [18]. While the transplant was technically success­
ful, the very slow removal of glycolipid-loaded macro­phages
from the damaged organs predicted that the therapy would
be frustrating in many cases. Furthermore, despite the
results enthusiastically reported more than 15 years later
by Krivit and his co-workers [19], it seems unlikely that
HST would be a satisfactory approach to central nervous
system manifestations of the LSDs. In fact, the few reports
in the medical literature suggest that HST is of marginal
benefit when used alone in Gaucher’s disease [20,21]. Gene
therapy approaches have also been far less than spectacular
[22,23]. The normal glucocerebrosidase gene can be
detected after gene transfer and it may be expressed, but,
thus far, not to an extent to influence the disease.
Since both HST and gene therapy have not yet fulfilled
their promise in Gaucher’s disease or other LSDs, enzyme-
replacement therapy (ERT), despite its incomplete effect
and enormous expense, has become the only available
stop-gap measure, akin to insulin in diabetes and red cell
transfusion in thalassemia.
The LSDs for which ERT is currently the treatment of
choice include, in addition to type 1 Gaucher’s disease,
mucopolysaccharidosis I, II and IV, Fabry’s disease, and
Pompe’s disease [24]. The critical experiments by Elizabeth
Neufeld and her colleagues set the stage for that thera­
peutic development by demonstrating the essential role of
cellular mannose receptors in the transport of the relevant
enzymes bearing dephosphorylated mannose across the
cell and lysosomal membrane [25]. Armed with that know­
ledge and the ability first to purify the relevant enzyme
from human placenta [17], and subsequently to create large
amounts of dephosphorylated mannose-bearing enzyme
with recombinant methods, the treatment of type 1
Gaucher’s disease with ERT became a reality [17].
From the outset of the ERT era, clinical data showed that
the bone, hepatic and splenic manifestations of type 1
Gaucher’s disease could be improved, but the annual cost
of at least $350,000 per year represents an enormous
challenge to any healthcare budget and can only be
intelligently supported in a highly productive and efficient
health system. In the rare types of Gaucher’s disease that
affect the central nervous system, there is little or no
evidence of benefit from ERT [24,26]. ERT to improve the
non-neurologically impaired patient’s status, followed by
HST to achieve sufficiently permanent correction, may be
the most useful approach and one that would possibly
provide enough enzyme to obviate the continuous and
prohibitively expensive use of ERT in this, the most
common LSD.
The seven different types of mucopolysaccharidoses are
very rare diseases caused by autosomal recessive mutations
in various lysosomal enzymes involved in the breakdown of
mucopolysacccharides. Type I mucopolysaccharidosis is
caused by deficient lysosomal breakdown of glycosamino­
glycans and the consequent accumulation of heparan
sulfate and dermatan sulfate throughout the body. The
disorder is caused by mutations in alpha-l-iduronidase,
but the various mutations in the enzyme and unknown
modifiers cause three different phenotypes, known, in
descending order of severity, as Hurler’s, Hurler-Scheie
and Scheie’s syndromes. Cardiopulmonary, neurologic and
multiple organ involvements are characteristic, but the
pace of the disorder varies as noted above. Hence ERT can
delay the onset of symptoms, and patients genetically
destined for a shorter course may live into mid-life [27],
albeit at gigantic cost.
Fabry’s disease is an X-linked disorder caused by muta­
tions in alpha-galactosidase-A (GLA) that lead to the
accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids, particularly
globotriaosylceramid and galactosylceramid, both of which
accumulate in the cornea and vasculature and cause renal
and cardiac failure as well as neurological damage.
Hundreds of mutations in GLA have been described, and
the pace of the disease in affected males is related to the
degree to which GLA synthesis is impaired. In fact Fabry’s
disease should be considered in otherwise normal males
with unexpected onset of renal or cardiac failure. Benefits
of treatment with ERT can be demonstrated in clinical
trials but it may be difficult to measure clinical benefit in
an individual patient because the pace of the disease is
quite slow [28].
Pompe’s disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused
by mutations in acid alpha-glucosidase. This leads to
accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes, particularly in
muscle, and produces weakness and respiratory and cardiac
failure that may appear at any age, depending upon the
severity of the mutations. The disease is usually slowly
progressive. ERT is approved for Pompe’s disease but
transport of the enzyme across muscle requires a high
concentration of the product and the response to treatment
is usually quite slow [29].
Clearly ERT is at best an incomplete and tremendously
expensive treatment that is most effective when applied in
classic non-neuropathic Gaucher’s disease. But it does
represent a hopeful development for sufferers of the rarer
LSDs and may save lives until more effective gene-
replacement therapy can take its place in our treatment
portfolio. It seems likely, however, that the LSDs can be
prevented by implantation genetic technology if carriers

are identified prior to procreation. The focus of our efforts
in the management of these diseases should surely be
directed toward prevention.
