Abstract
Transfusion-associated iron overload induces systemic toxicity. Deferasirox, a convenient long acting oral agent, has recently
been introduced in clinical practice with a promising efficacy. But there are some patients who experience drug-related
toxicities and cannot tolerate it. To investigate effect of genetic variations on the toxicities and find optimal target
population, we analyzed the genetic polymorphisms of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A (UGT1A) subfamily, multi-drug
resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). A total of 20 functional genetic
polymorphisms were analyzed in 98 patients who received deferasirox to reduce transfusion-induced iron overload. We
retrospectively reviewed the medical records to find out the drug-related toxicities. Fifteen (15.3%) patients developed
hepatotoxicity. Patients without wild-type allele carrying two MRP2 haplotypes containing 21774 del and/or 224T were at
increased risk of developing hepatotoxicity compared to patients with the wild-type allele on multivariate analysis
(OR = 7.17, 95% CI = 1.79–28.67, P = 0.005). Creatinine elevation was observed in 9 patients (9.2%). Body weight $40 kg and
homozygosity for UGT1A1*6 were risk factors of creatinine elevation (OR = 8.48, 95% CI = 1.7–43.57, P = 0.010 and
OR = 14.17, 95% CI = 1.34–150.35, P = 0.028). Our results indicate that functional genetic variants of enzymes to metabolize
and transport deferasirox are associated with drug-related toxicities. Further studies are warranted to confirm the results as
the pharmacogenetic biomarkers of deferasirox.

Introduction
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in pediatric patients with
cancer and hematologic disease is necessary to maintain body
RBC pool. Because human has no biological mechanisms to
remove the excess iron, patients who are transfusion-dependent
are at risk of iron overload. Free iron catalyzes the conversion of
reactive oxygen species intermediates to highly toxic free radicals
which may mediate tissue injury [1]. It is known that transfusion-
associated iron overload is associated with the increase of the
treatment-related toxicity. This is particularly cases with an
intensive therapy such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(HSCT) [2,3,4,5,6,7].
It is highly probable that iron chelation may reduce the iron-
induced tissue toxicity and thereby improve the short- and long-
term treatment outcome. Our previous report showed that an
elevated serum ferritin level was associated with both an increased
treatment-related mortality and a decreased survival. In addition,
it also suggested that the iron chelating therapy had a benefit of
improving the outcomes of HSCT [5].
Deferoxamine has been the standard drug for iron chelation
therapy over the past four decades. However, its major
disadvantage is non-compliance of patients, because it needs an
8- to 12-hr parenteral administration since it has a short half-life
and a very poor oral bioavailability [8,9,10,11]. A more
convenient oral iron chelator, deferasirox, has recently become
available showing promising efficacy [12,13,14,15,16,17]. Many
studies have shown that deferasirox has an acceptable profile of
safety and tolerability. Nevertheless, it has also been reported that
some patients experienced drug-related toxicities and could not
tolerate it. The most common side effects of deferasirox were
gastrointestinal disturbance and skin rash, but they also include
agranulocytosis, creatinine elevation and hepatitis
[13,15,18,19,20,21].
Pharmacogenetics has been used widely to predict individual
responses or toxicities to drugs by investigating genetic differences
in metabolic pathways [22]. However, there has been no data
published so far showing the relationship between the genetic
polymorphisms and the side effects of deferasirox. As it is known
that deferasirox is mainly metabolized by glucuronidation and

eliminated into the bile through multidrug resistance protein 2
(MRP2) [23], the effect and toxicity of deferasirox may be
influenced by the variability of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase,
MRP2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) which are
important for intestinal drug absorption and hepatic drug
elimination [24]. In this study, we analyzed the genetic polymor-
phisms of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A (UGT1A) subfamily,
MRP2 and BCRP to predict toxicities and find optimal target
population for deferasirox treatment in pediatric patients.
Materials and Methods
Patients
Patients who received deferasirox because of transfusion-
associated iron overload were enrolled for this study. Transfu-
sion-associated iron overload was defined as ferritin $1,000 ng/
mL in patients who needed RBC transfusions over 8 units per
year.
Ethics
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
Seoul National University Hospital (H-0709-011-217) and regis-
tered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01623895). Written informed
consents were obtained for all patients from their parents on the
behalf of the children participants.
Definition of drug-related toxicities
During the administration of deferasirox, we examined com-
plete blood count and serum chemistry. We retrospectively
reviewed the medical records to find out the drug-related
toxicities. Drug-related hepatotoxicity was defined as increased
AST or ALT .56ULN or increased bilirubin .36ULN which
was thought to be caused by deferasirox, and creatinine elevation
was defined as serum creatinine level increase more than 50%
above baseline.
Genotyping
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells using
QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, California,
USA). Functional genetic variations of BCRP (34G.A,
8191C.T, 8825C.A), MRP2 (21774delG, 224C.T),
UGT1A1 (23279T.G, 239insTA, 211G.A, 686C.A),
UGT1A3 (17A.G, 31T.C, 81G.A, 133C.T, 140T.C,
477A.G), UGT1A7 (387T.G, 391C.A, 392G.A, 622T.C),
and UGT1A9 (2118insT) were determined using either direct
sequencing or pyrosequencing methods as previously described
[25,26,27].
Individual haplotypes were estimated from genotype data by the
Bayesian method using the PHASE program (version 2.0.2) [28].
Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the two alleles was
estimated as relative disequilibrium (D’) from estimated haplotype
data [29].
Statistical methods
The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was assessed by the chi-
square test with df = 1 for all tested single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs). Clinical data (body weight, gender, ferritin level
and dose of deferasirox), genotype and haplotype were used as
independent variables to predict the occurrence of toxicities. We
performed a univariate analysis with each genotype and haplo-
type. Then multivariate analysis was done with genotype/
haplotype of which P-value was less than 0.2 on univarate
analysis. The above-stated clinical variables were used as
confounding factors for multivariate analysis. A logistic regression
model was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95%
confidence interval for the risk of toxicities. SPSS version 19.0 was
used for all statistical analyses, and statistical significance was
accepted when P-value was less than 0.05.
Results
Clinical characteristics of patients
A total of 98 patients (63 male and 35 female) were enrolled.
The median age was 9.0 (1.0–23.0) years and the median body
weight was 27.4 (8.8–80.0) kg. The diagnoses were acute leukemia
in 20 (20.4%), lymphoma in 4 (4.1%), solid tumor in 63 (64.3%),
aplastic anemia in 5 (5.1%), and other hematologic disease in 6
(6.1%) patients. Patients received median 29.4 (17.9–34.1) mg/kg
of deferasirox as an initial dose, and the median ferritin level at the
initiation of deferasirox was 1,943 (1,025–11,032) ng/mL. Sixty-
one (62.2%) patients were on their chemotherapy schedule during
the use of deferasirox.
Pharmacogenetic analysis
Genotypes of the 20 candidate loci and haplotypes in 98
patients are summarized in Table S1. All of the genotypes were in
Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P.0.05).
Hepatotoxicity
Fifteen patients (15.3%) developed hepatotoxicity at a median
60 (13–198) days after the administration. The hepatotoxicity was
increased AST/ALT .56ULN in 14 patients, and increased
bilirubin .36ULN in 1 patient.
Risk factor analyses were performed and the results are
summarized in Table I. Risk of hepatotoxicity was significantly
increased as non wild-type allele of MRP2 haplotype increased (P
for trend = 0.013). On univariate analysis, patients without wild-
type allele carrying two MRP2 haplotypes containing 21774 del
and/or 224T were at increased risk of hepatotoxicity compared
to patients with the wild-type allele (OR = 4.92, 95% CI = 1.52–
15.90, P = 0.008). The effect of MRP2 haplotype maintained the
statistical significance on multivariate analysis (OR = 7.17, 95%
CI = 1.79–28.67, P = 0.005).
All of the 15 patients showed decreased AST/ALT and
bilirubin (AST/ALT #56ULN and bilirubin #16UNL) at
median 9.5 (2–19) days after discontinuation of deferasirox.
Creatinine elevation
There were 9 (9.2%) patients whose serum creatinine level
increased more than 50% above baseline at a median time of 49
(14–128) days after the start of deferasirox. The median age of
patients with creatinine elevation was 14.1 (2.8–16.3) years.
Risk factor analyses were performed for creatinine elevation and
the results are represented in Table II. The risk of creatinine
elevation was higher in patients with a greater body weight when
the body weight was analyzed as a continuous variable
(OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01–1.10, P = 0.010 in univariate analysis
and OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01–1.10, P = 0.016 in multivariate
analysis). When the body weight was divided into categorical
variable based on a cut-off value of 40 kg, creatinine elevation
occurred more commonly in patients with a body weight of
$40 kg (22.6%) compared to those with a body weight of ,40 kg
(3.0%) (OR = 8.48, 95% CI = 1.7–43.57, P = 0.010). Patients with
homozygote of UGT1A1*6 had 14.17-times higher risk of
creatinine elevation than the other patients on multivariate
analysis (OR = 14.17, 95% CI = 1.34–150.35, P = 0.028).

Discussion
Of the total 98 patients, 15 (15.3%) developed hepatotoxicity
and 9 (9.2%) had a creatinine elevation. According to the previous
EPIC study enrolling 1,744 patients including pediatric cases, a
relatively high cut-off value of .106ULN was used in this study,
and elevated liver enzyme levels were seen only in 0.7% of total
cases [14]. In other 2 studies where a cut-off value was .56ULN,
elevated liver enzyme levels were reported in 3.8% and 7.6% of
total cases, respectively [16,30]. According to studies that have
been conducted in pediatric patients, the incidence of hepatotox-
icity was slightly higher. A phase II trial with 39 pediatric b-
thalassemia patients reported 12.8% of elevated liver enzyme with
a cut-off value of .56ULN [19], and fluctuations of liver enzymes
were reported in a recent long-term observational study with
pediatric patients [31].
Our results showed that MRP2 haplotype affected the incidence
of hepatotoxicity. MRP2, also known as ABCC2, is an organic
anion transporter expressed at important pharmacological barri-
ers, such as canalicular membrane of hepatocytes and epithelial
cells of proximal tubules. It is involved in the biliary elimination of
both endogenous and exogenous waste products [32]. When anion
deferasirox is eliminated from the liver into the bile, this process
seems to be partly catalyzed by MRP2 [23]. Due to this fact, it is
possible that patients without wild-type allele of MRP2 haplotype
are at increased risk of developing hepatotoxicity than the other
patients with it.
Chronic iron overload is known to have prefibrogenic effects on
the liver due to oxidative stress [33], and therefore iron overload
itself can be a risk factor of hepatotoxicity in the patients receiving
iron chelation therapy [34]. We did a univariate and a
multivariate analysis using the ferritin level as an independent
variable for predicting the risk of hepatotoxicity, but there was no
association between the ferritin level and the development of
hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, all patients who had hepatotoxicity
showed decreased AST/ALT and bilirubin (AST/ALT #56ULN
and bilirubin #16UNL) after discontinuation of deferasirox.
These findings suggested that hepatotoxicity observed in our study
was mainly associated with the administration of deferasirox.

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64114
Many previous studies have reported that creatinine elevation is
one of the common adverse effects occurring at an incidence
ranging from 10.0% to 39.7%, although the cut-off values were
variable depending on the authors [14,16,31,35].
Risk factor analyses revealed that body weight $40 kg and the
UGT1A1*6 genotype were the risk factors of creatinine elevation.
UGT1A1 encodes a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, an enzyme of
the glucuronidation pathway that transforms small lipophilic
molecules, such as steroids, bilirubin, hormones, and drugs, into
water-soluble, excretable metabolites [36]. Many pharmacogenet-
ic studies have shown that UGT1A1 polymorphisms,
UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6 in particular, are risk factors of
irinotecan-related toxicities [37,38,39]. Irinotecan is a prodrug
that is converted to the active metabolite (SN-38), further
undergoing the metabolic detoxification by hepatic UGT1A1 to
an inactive metabolite [40]. Because the major metabolic pathway
of deferasirox is glucuronidation by UGT1A1 [41], its toxicity
could be related to the UGT1A1 polymorphism.
In our study, there was only 1 patient with UGT1A1*28/*28
homozygote, and this patient developed creatinine elevation. The
distribution of UGT1A1 polymorphism is known to be variable
between the ethnic groups with relatively lower UGT1A1*28 allele
frequency in Asian population [37,38,42,43,44]. Our study could
not demonstrate any statistical significance of UGT1A1*28
genotype, but further study is needed in Caucasian population
with a somewhat higher UGT1A1*28 allele frequency.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that
side effects of deferasirox are related to the genetic polymorphisms.
Hepatotoxicity and creatinine elevation were associated with
MRP2 haplotype and UGT1A1*6 genotype, respectively. In
conclusion, our results indicate that functional genetic variants of
enzymes to metabolize and transport deferasirox are associated
with drug-related toxicities. Further studies are warranted to
confirm the results as the pharmacogenetic biomarkers of
deferasirox.
