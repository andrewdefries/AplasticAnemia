A case of steroid-induced osteoporosis-related multiple fractures and dislocations are described after a seizure is reported. Patient
had two years history of steroid use with no supplement or antiresorptive therapy. There was a delay in the diagnosis which aﬀected
an otherwise good outcome in such situations. It is recommended that patients on steroid should be given calcium, vitamin D, and
an antiresorptive. Furthermore, a meticulous clinical examination is required in patients who are on steroids and suﬀer epileptic
seizures to rule out skeletal injury.
1. Introduction
Prolonged use of corticosteroids cause osteoporosis by both
decreasing osteoblastic and increasing osteoclastic activity
[1–3]. Skeletal trauma after seizure is well known. However,
we are reporting here a case of simultaneous bilateral
femoral neck fractures and bilateral humeral neck fractures
after one episode of seizure. The patient had two years
use of high dose steroid with no antiresorptive therapy.
Investigations postinjury documented osteoporosis. This is
the ﬁrst reported simultaneous four axial joints fractures.
2. Case Report
A 36 years old Saudi Male was brought to the Emergency
Room following a generalized convulsions and loss of
consciousness. He was driving a car and felt an acute sharp
pain at right shoulder, few seconds later, he developed
blurring of vision and he was able to stop the car and lost
consciousness for 15–20 minutes. He was observed to have
rolling up of the eyes with frothy salivations and trauma to
the tongue. The patient complained of severe arthralgia and
pain on minimal movement of any joint. On examination
he was noted to have petechiae all over his body, no signs of
meningeal irritation and there was a lesion over the scapula
which was diagnosed as a snake bite. Blood investigations
were normal and computerized tomography of the brain
was normal. Patient was loaded with phenytoin 25 mg/Kg
body weight. In the ward he developed echymotic lesions
on the skin and upper extremities, with recurrent vomiting,
distended abdomen, paralytic ileus, and deteriorating renal
and liver function tests. In the intensive care unit the patient
was treated by antivenom and supportive therapy. At the
end of the 7th day the general condition improved and
patient started to complain of painful hips and shoulders.
On further inquiry, patient gave a history of using 15 mg
prednisolone daily for aplastic anemia for two years. No
supplement or antiresorptive therapy was given to him.
Clinical examination showed that both the shoulder joints
were dislocated and any attempt to move the hips and
right wrist caused tremendous amount of pain. Radiographs
showed that bilateral anterior dislocation of shoulder with
bilateral fracture surgical neck, Smith’s fracture of the right
radius and bilateral fracture of the neck of femur (Garden IV)
(Figures 1 and 2). Under general anesthesia both shoulder
joints were reduced, fracture necks of femur were ﬁxed
with two cannulated screws (Figure 3), Smith’s fracture was
reduced and plaster of paris application was done. Two weeks

later, bone mineral density of the spine (Dual Energy X-ray
Absorptiometry, DEXA scan) showed severe osteoporosis
with T score of −2.9. Last follow-up appointment was four
years from the incidence and revealed no pain but rather
painless limping. Examination showed right hip and left
hip had limited range of movements and pain at extreme
degree. The range of movements of the shoulder joints were
normal.
3. Comments
Corticosteroids cause low bone mass by cellular apoptosis
causing both decreased osteoblastic and increased osteo-
clastic activity [1]. It is well established that long-term
use of glucocorticoid use increases risk of fractures [2, 3].
De Vries et al. [4] reported that a daily dose of higher
or equal to 15 milligrams have a substantial higher risk
of fractures but Steinbuch et al. [5] believed that higher
dose and longer duration is needed to increase the risk of
fractures. The guidelines for prevention of Glucocorticoid-
induced osteoporosis has been long proposed [6–9]. Devo-
gelaer et al. [10] reported that supplemental calcium and
vitamin D should be the ﬁrst-line therapy in patients
receiving ≥7.5 milligrams/daily. Compston [11] suggested
that bisphosphonates should be the treatment of choice,
with supplementation of calcium and vitamin D. more
recent studies [12] suggest teriparatide as a replacement of
alandronate. our patient was on 15 mg of prednisolone with
no supplementation or antiresorptive therapy.
Skeletal trauma due to generalized tonic and clonic
seizures is not uncommon. Vertebral fractures [13], femoral
neck [14], skull [14], shoulder, and humeral head [15] have
been reported. Joshy [16] reported a case of bilateral femoral
neck fracture due to an epileptic ﬁt. Our patient sustained
bilateral femoral neck fractures, bilateral shoulder surgical
neck fracture dislocations and a Smith’s fracture. It has
been reported that fractures are 2–6 times more common
in epileptic patients than the general population [17–19].
This has been blamed on low bone mass which is caused
by antiepilepsy drugs [20], but our patient sustained all the
injuries during the ﬁrst known attack of the epileptic ﬁt and
had steroid-induced low bone mass.
Bilateral hip fractures are not uncommon and occur
due to high energy trauma, and early diagnosis reduces the
incidence of permanent disability. Skeletal injuries due to
postepileptic ﬁt could be of serious consequences as the
diagnosis is often delayed which cause long-term functional
disability [21], which in our patient ended in bilateral
avascular necrosis of head of femur. Delay in the diagnosis
was thought to be due to the fact that patients remain in the
intensive care unit, often unconscious and ventilated. Our
patient was not ventilated but was complaining of severe
arthralgia and diﬃculty in moving the limbs should have
alerted the treating physicians.
Our case demonstrates that when patients are being
treated with long-term steroids, need to be treated with
antiresorptives otherwise an episode of epileptic ﬁt could
lead to major skeletal trauma.
