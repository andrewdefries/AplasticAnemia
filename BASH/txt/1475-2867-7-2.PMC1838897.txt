Abstract
Cancer begins with multiple cumulative epigenetic and genetic alterations that sequencially
transform a cell, or a group of cells in a particular organ. The early genetic events might lead to
clonal expansion of pre-neoplastic daughter cells in a particular tumor field. Subsequent genomic
changes in some of these cells drive them towards the malignant phenotype. These transformed
cells are diagnosed histopathologically as cancers owing to changes in cell morphology.
Conceivably, a population of daughter cells with early genetic changes (without histopathology)
remain in the organ, demonstrating the concept of field cancerization. With present technological
advancement, including laser capture microdisection and high-throughput genomic technologies,
carefully designed studies using appropriate control tissue will enable identification of important
molecular signatures in these genetically transformed but histologically normal cells. Such tumor-
specific biomarkers should have excellent clinical utility. This review examines the concept of field
cancerization in several cancers and its possible utility in four areas of oncology; risk assessment,
early cancer detection, monitoring of tumor progression and definition of tumor margins.
Background
The sequential genetic changes that drive a cell towards
malignancy occur over several years. In view of this, the
American Association for Cancer Research Task Force on
the treatment and prevention of intraepithelial neoplasia
(IEN) has recognized the importance of targeting the
treatment of early cancerous lesions to prevent or regress
carcinogenesis [1]. Considerable research has identified
molecular markers of IEN that serve as useful targets or
endpoints of chemoprevention [1-3]. This laudable effort
by the Task Force can be complemented by identification
of biomarkers in normal tissues adjacent to tumors (peri-
tumoral cancer fields). Validated biomarkers from cancer
fields should be useful for primary chemoprevention
studies as well.
The idea of field cancerization was conceived by Slaughter
almost a decade prior to introducing the term in 1953. In
an earlier publication he stated that; "cancer does not arise
as an isolated cellular phenomenon, but rather as an anaplastic
tendency involving many cells at once" [4]. The term "lateral
cancerization" was subsequently used to indicate that the
lateral spread of tumors was due to progressive transfor-
mation of cells adjacent to a tumor, rather than the spread
and destruction of the adjacent epithelium by pre-existing
cancer cells [5]. In a more extensive histopathologic

review of 783 oral cancer patients, Slaughter and col-
leagues then used the term field cancerization to describe
the existence of generalized carcinogen induced early
genetic changes in the epithelium from which multiple
independent lesions occur, leading to the development of
multifocal tumors [6]. In some cases, multiple contiguous
tumor foci coalesce that partly explain the lateral spread of
squamous cell cancers. It was also observed that normal
looking cells in close proximity to malignant cells were
histologically abnormal and therefore were part of the
transformed cells in a particular tumor field, and conse-
quently were responsible for the occurrence of local
tumor recurrences. These observations were made at
about the era the DNA double helix was discovered by
Watson and Crick, hence in the absence of modern molec-
ular techniques. More recent studies using various genetic
analyses have provided unequivocal evidence in support
of the work of Slaughter and colleagues [7].
An important unanswered question of field cancerization
is exactly how these cancer fields develop. Could a partic-
ular carcinogen induce multiple distinct genetic altera-
tions in different cells resulting in polyclonal pre-
neoplastic lesions in a particular tissue from which multi-
ple tumors develop? Does a single genetic event occur in
a cell that clonally expands and laterally spreads to replace
the normal epithelium, and therefore create a large area of
pre-neoplastic field from which multiple tumors develop?
Alternatively, does an early genetic event occur simultane-
ously in a group of cells such that subsequent genetic
lesions drive some cells towards malignancy? Is it also
plausible that some field changes are created during orga-
nogenesis when some altered cells proliferate to generate
a vast area of preconditioned epithelial surface, such that
subsequent genetic lesions in some cells result in multiple
cancers? Whereas all these modes of field cancerization
are possible, molecular data accrued from studies of head
and neck, esophagus, and bladder cancers support the
clonal expansion model [8-10]. This model could explain
how multiple tumors develop in organs such as skin,
colon, esophagus, stomach, bladder, cervix, and vulva
that have contiguous epithelium. Though possible, it is
less likely that the spread of monoclonal cells is responsi-
ble for the development of multiple tumors in glandular
tissues like the lung, breast, ovary, pancreas, and prostate
that have discontinuous glandular epithelial organiza-
tion, even when exposed to the same carcinogen. Multiple
tumors in these organs are likely to originate from poly-
clonal tumor stem cells, although these clones may have
identical genetic alterations. For example, loss of hetero-
zygosity (LOH) in primary ductal carcinoma in situ
(DCIS) were distinct from those in their corresponding
cancers, suggesting that some DCIS and subsequent aden-
ocarcinoma in the same breast developed from genetically
divergent clones [11]. Furthermore, a study of microdis-
sected normal glands and their co-existing malignant epi-
thelia from breast cancer specimens demonstrated that
only one had identical LOH to the cancer, with the major-
ity harboring LOH at different genetic loci from the tumor
[12].
Notwithstanding the mechanism of precancerous field
development, the multistep model of tumorigenesis is
probably better understood by field cancerization studies.
Importantly, genetic information gained at various stages
of cancer development continues to advance our knowl-
edge and understanding of cancer biology, and how such
molecular markers can be used clinically. Recent molecu-
lar techniques have enabled detection of alterations at all
genomic levels. Epigenetic gene silencing, chromosomal
anomalies, LOH, DNA sequence analysis for SNP and
mutation detection, altered gene expression (transcripts
and proteins), and mitochondrial genome changes have
all been demonstrated in both precancerous lesions and
normal appearing cells close to tumors [10,13-19]. One
can even infer a metabolomic field cancerization profile
in various tissues. It could be surmised that the early
genetic changes will remain with the tumor cells as well as
pre-neoplastic cells from the same organ. If well character-
ized, such early molecular alterations could have great
value in risk assessment, early cancer detection, monitor-
ing of disease progression, and chemoprevention.
A highly informative but almost forgotten genome is that
contained in the mitochondrion. This organelle produces
almost all the energy required for cellular physiology, and
an inevitable byproduct of this reaction is the generation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage
nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. The mitochondrial
genome is less protected and has an inefficient repair
mechanism compared to the nuclear genome, and yet is
bathed by ROS. Not surprisingly therefore, the mitochon-
drial genome has a high mutation rate, and this may sig-
nal the genesis of cancer [20]. In addition, leakage of ROS
into the nucleus can cause mutations in nuclear genes that
could initiate the malignant process [21]. It is thus likely
that the modest mtDNA molecule might sustain early
genetic damage, and thus an even earlier biomarker indic-
ative of field cancerization compared to nuclear genomic
alterations that have been extensively studied.
Since the focus of this review is the identification and util-
ity of genetic alterations in normal adjacent cells or pre-
cancerous cells that differ from normal donor control
samples, the term field cancerization is used to broadly
mean "the process whereby cells in a particular tissue or
organ are transformed, such that genetically altered but
histologically normal appearing cells predate the develop-
ment of neoplasia or coexist with malignant cells, irre-
spective of clonality".

Field cancerization is probably a general
phenomenon of epithelial tumors
An important physiologic function of epithelia is their
protective role that inevitably exposes them to environ-
mental substances, including carcinogens that can create a
vast area of genetically altered cancer fields. Epithelial
cells frequently self renew and can undergo abnormal pro-
liferation. Hyperplastic epithelia could form the basis of
neoplastic transformation leading to the formation of the
most common types of cancers of the human body.
Molecular signatures of field cancerization have been doc-
umented for several epithelial tumors including those of
the head and neck [22], esophagus [23], stomach [24],
lungs [25], skin [26], cervix [27], vulva [28], bladder [29],
colon [15], breast [17], ovary [30], pancreas [31], and
recently the prostate [32]. It has even been conceptualized
in brain and hematologic malignancies [33,34]. A brief
synopsis of both nuclear and mitochondrial genetic mark-
ers used in field cancerization studies of several epithelial
tumors is first provided.
Head and neck cancer
Given that field cancerization was first described in oral
cancers, it is not surprising that considerable molecular
genetic studies have been conducted in head and neck
tumors in an attempt to explain the mechanisms and
importance of this phenomenon [7,35,36]. Whereas the
debate on the clonal nature of these fields is ongoing,
carefully designed experiments with strict definition of
clonality (i.e., using cytogenetic markers, microsatellite
instability, and mutation analysis) seem to support the
notion that the majority of head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) originates from contiguous mono-
clonal pre-neoplastic fields [10]. Indeed a field size of over
7 cm has been mapped in these cancers [10], and about
62.5% of HNSCC second primary tumor recurrences are
from similar clonal fields left behind after resection [13].
Recently, abnormal protein profiles were demonstrated in
various samples of head and neck cancer in contrast to
healthy patients. Profiling of mucosa from 73 healthy
individuals, 113 HNSCC, 99 tumor-distant, and 18
tumor-adjacent discovered that 72% of tumor-adjacent
and 27.3% of tumor-distance samples harbored aberrant
protein profiles indicative of field cancerization. Interest-
ingly, these altered protein profiles in tumor-distant sam-
ples were significantly associated with tumor relapse,
indicating that proteomic analysis of peri-tumoral sam-
ples might have prognostic value [22]. It appears that car-
cinogen exposure creates a large molecularly altered pre-
neoplastic field in the epithelium of the aerodigestive tract
from which multiple tumors develop, and the remaining
cancer fields left after resection give rise to local recur-
rences.
A role for geneomic alterations in stromal tissue in mod-
ulating the development of HNSCC was recently pro-
vided. Using laser-capture microdissection, tumor
epithelial and stromal cells were obtained form 122
patients for whole genome LOH and allelic imbalance
analysis using 366 microsatellite markers, and the results
were compared to clinicopathologic parameters at presen-
tation. Tumor size and nodal metastases were linked to
three stroma-specific loci, whilst two epithelial loci were
associated with nodal invasion [37]. Stromal genetic alter-
ations therefore appear to control the growth and spread
of HNSCC.
Field cancerization in HNSCC has also been addressed
using mtDNA markers. Ha et al. [18] analyzed 137 prema-
lignant lesions from 93 patients and demonstrated the
presence of mtDNA C-tract alterations in 34 patients com-
pared to their germline mtDNA. Notably, these mutations
increased with increasing severity of dysplasia, suggesting
acquired mitochondrial genome alterations might drive
or indicate disease progression. Normal adjacent mucosas
to dysplastic lesions were also analyzed. Identical mtDNA
mutations were found in peri-lesional tissue of 3/8 lesions
that had mtDNA alterations. Mutations persisted in 3/7
metachronous lesions, while 8/18 synchronous lesions
had an identical pattern of mitochondrial mutations [18].
These findings lend support for the monoclonal nature of
some head and neck cancer fields. In another study by this
group, mitochondrial content alteration was observed in
premalignant lesions and appear to increase with disease
progression to malignancy [38]. These changes in mtDNA
content can be detected in saliva [39], and the levels seem
to decrease with treatment [40], indicating the possibility
of a non-invasive means of early detection and monitor-
ing of head and neck cancers using mtDNA markers. The
levels of the 4977 bp common mtDNA deletion has been
investigated by quantitative PCR in laser-capture micro-
dissected tissues from paired oral cancers, their precancer-
ous lesions and adjacent submucosal stroma in
comparison to lymphocytes microdissected from lymph
node biopsies [41]. The deletion was higher in lesions
compared to lymphocytes. Interestingly, precancerous
lesions had higher levels of the deletion than cancerous
tissue, and in both cases, the adjacent submucosal stroma
harbored more deletions than the lesions [41]. Thus the
levels of the common deletion are increased in precancer-
ous oral lesions, and appear to decrease with disease pro-
gression to invasive cancer. This might suggest transition
to an advantageous energy producing pathway.
Lung cancer
Smoking is an established carcinogen of lung cancer. In an
attempt to map out smoking-related cancer fields, Frank-
lin et al. [42] sampled tissues from the entire tracheobron-
chial tree of one individual who had 50-pack-years of
Cancer Cell International 2007, 7:2 http://www.cancerci.com/content/7/1/2

smoking history without lung cancer, for p53 mutation
analysis. They found that a transversion in codon 245 was
present in 7/10 sites in both lungs, indicating a carcinogen
targeted mutation in widespread lung epithelium of this
individual [42]. Clone sizes in lung epithelium have been
studied using twelve microsatellite markers on microdis-
sected tumors and associated normal appearing bronchial
epithelium. Clone sizes of up to 90,000 cells were identi-
fied [43]. Several sites of normal looking epithelium con-
tained genetic abnormalities as well. Tumors from an
individual tended to be homogeneous with respect to
molecular markers, however, pre-neoplastic clonal
patches were often heterogeneous [43]. More recently,
LOH, especially at chromosome 12p12 was demonstrated
in normal bronchial epithelium of long-term smokers,
and deletion hotspots at two chromosomal regions
(2q35-q36, 12p12p13) were observed in non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) and matched normal bronchial epi-
thelial cells [25]. This suggests LOH could indicate suscep-
tibility to or potential presence of cancer and may be a
hallmark of progression of apparently phenotypically
normal pre-neoplastic cells to cancer [44]. Thus, similar to
the aerodigestive tract, it appears that carcinogens cause
an early genetic change in widespread tracheobronchial
epithelium from which multiple tumors develop. Given
that about 72% of lung cancers diagnosed have already
spread [45], non-invasive molecular profiling of sputum
for biomarkers from tracheobronchial epithelial cancer
fields in high risk population should aid early diagnosis.
Esophageal cancer
Barrett's esophagus is a pre-neoplastic condition of
esophageal cancer, and thus has served as a useful model
for studies of clonality and tumor progression in field can-
cerization. Using p53 mutation as a clonal marker, Prevo
et al. [8] mapped 213 endoscopic biopsies from 58
patients, and demonstrated that 50% were clonal and
occupied cancer fields ranging from 1 cm to 9 cm [8].
LOH at 9p21 (p16 locus) and 17p13 (p53 locus) have also
been used to map fields in the esophagus [46]. In 61
patients with 404 samples, LOH at one or both loci was
observed in 73% of cases. Clone sizes were heterogene-
ous, with many clones showing incomplete expansion,
however some were as large as 2 cm, and others occupied
the entire Barrett's segment [46]. In another study, it was
observed that clone expansion correlated with p16 status,
being 1.5 cm in p16+/+, 6 cm in p16+/-, and 8 cm in p16-/
- clones. Indeed, mutant p16 clones could expand to
involve about 17 cm of the esophagus [23]. Epigenetic
gene silencing of APC, CDH1, ESR1 and p16 has been
studied in Barrett's esophagus. Hypermethylation in large
contiguous fields were observed, further confirming
molecular field cancerization in Barrett's metaplasia [47].
In a prospective study where 267 patients were followed,
it was demonstrated that clone sizes (which is an index of
clones multiplied by the length of Barretts's segment they
occupied) with p53 LOH and ploidy, were a better predic-
tor of progression towards adenocarcinoma [48]. Clones
with p16 lesions did not carry much risk for tumor devel-
opment in the absence of p53 LOH. Thus, clone expan-
sion with added genetic instability seems to indicate
disease progression in Barrett's esophagus. Recently, a
clonal cellular diversity theory appears to explain progres-
sion of Barrett's esophagus towards adenocarcinoma. By
applying the principles of ecology and evolution, (muta-
tion rate, population size of evolving clones, rate of natu-
ral selection or clonal expansion), clonal diversity was a
strong predictor of disease progression, even after control-
ling for known risk factors such as p53 LOH and ploidy
abnormalities [49,50]. This finding is clinically relevant in
terms of disease surveillance.
Recently, a new and sensitive array-based sequencing of
mtDNA from 14 pre-neoplastic lesions of the gastrointes-
tinal tract (7 Barrett esophagus, 4 colonic adenomas, and
3 inflammatory colitis-associated dyplasia) was per-
formed. MtDNA mutations were observed in all 14 pre-
neoplastic samples. Two colonic adenocarcinomas and
the synchronous dysplastic lesions harbored identical
genetic changes, suggesting a possible field cancerization
[14]. This finding suggests that whole genome mtDNA
profiling might help early detection of gastrointestinal
tumors.
Gastric cancer
Genetic evidence has been provided for the multicentric-
ity of synchronous multiple gastric cancers. Analysis of
mutation pattern in APC, MCC and p53 genes in multiple
tumors from 13 patients (10 with double tumors, 2 with
triple tumors and 1 with quadruple tumors), concluded
that there was discordance in mutation patterns in these
tumors [51]. Thus, independent genetic events in a pre-
conditioned epithelium might have given rise to these
multiple lesions. Epigenetic silencing via CpG island
hypermethylation of LIMS1, a gene involved in cell dis-
persion has been demonstrated in 53% of gastric cancers
[24]. Interestingly, LIMS1 methylation was observed in
normal-appearing gastric tissue suggesting that this could
be an early genetic event in the development of gastric
neoplasia [24]. C-erb amplification was observed in a sub-
set of tumors and the normal mucosa close to tumor mar-
gin [52], and aneuploidy was frequent in normal mucosa
at about 3 cm distance from the tumor margin [53].
Colorectal cancer
Colorectal cancers lend themselves to the study of field
cancerization owing to the contiguous nature of their epi-
thelium. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) staining inten-
sities in normal colonic mucosa adjacent to tumor was
similar to that of the tumor, but this decreased at a dis-
Cancer Cell International 2007, 7:2 http://www.cancerci.com/content/7/1/2

(page number not for citation purposes)
tance of 1 cm, and staining at 5 cm from the tumor margin
was identical to mucosa without tumor [54]. Thus, a gra-
dient of CEA expression in peri-tumoral colon epithelium
was observed. Recently, evidence for field cancerization in
colorectal cancer has been provided by analysis of pro-
moter methylation in the DNA repair gene, O6-methyl-
guanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) [15]. In this
well designed study, methylation in tumors was observed
to be associated with methylation in normal adjacent
mucosa, and normal appearing colorectal mucosa located
10 cm away from tumors were methylated in 10/13
tumors. Normal mucosa located 1 cm from tumor margin
was more likely to be hypermethylated than those 10 cm
away [15]. Epigenetic silencing of MGMT thus creates a
preconditioned genetic field from which colorectal
tumors develop. Indeed, epigenetic events are proving to
be useful biomarkers of the molecular process leading to
colorectal cancer [55]. In another study, K-ras oncogene
was found to be mutated and activated in 30% and 26%
of adenomas respectively. Importantly, several down-
stream targets of K-ras were over-expressed in adenomas
[56], indicating that these can be evaluated for early diag-
nosis and risk assessment.
Vulval and cervical cancers
Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is often clonal and
contiguous with vulval squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC).
This suggests VIN may be a precursor lesion of VSCC. X-
chromosome inactivation analysis of 9 cases of VIN, 10
cases of VSCC with contiguous VIN and 11 cases of VSCC
with noncontiguous VIN indicates the majority of VIN
and VSCC were monoclonal in origin. Two cases of VIN
with noncontiguous VSCC, however, had molecular pat-
terns consistent with separate clonal origins [28]. Allelo-
typing of three markers on chromosome 3p in
microdissected samples from low and high grade cervical
intraepithelial lesions found that microsatellite instabili-
ties were common in low grade lesions associated with
invasive cancers, suggesting pre-malignant and malignant
lesions were of monoclonal origin [27]. Thus, biomarkers
in early stage vulval and cervical lesions seem useful for
early detection and monitoring of these cancers.
Skin cancer
The organ most exposed to environmental carcinogens
including ultraviolet radiation (UVR), is skin. Gene muta-
tions caused by UVR play a critical role in the develop-
ment of skin cancer. Different skin neoplasms are
associated with signature gene mutations and alterations
in gene expression. Precursor lesions such as actinic kera-
tosis (AK) is associated with p53 mutations (and moder-
ately increased p16 expression); squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC) is associated with p53 mutations, increased p16
expression, activation of the mitogenic ras pathway,
reduced expression of FasR (CD95-R) and increased
expression of FasL; and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is
associated with mutations in PTCH (from the sonic
hedgehog pathway) and p53. The contiguous nature and
ease of accessibility of skin has made this organ suitable
for studies of the mechanisms of how field cancerization
develops. In fact, field cancerization in skin has been
described as a process "whereby the whole neighborhood
is affected". As described above, mutations in p53 are
common in skin cancer and as such have been used as
biomarkers of clonality in the skin. In one study, p53
mutations were present in non-melanoma skin cancer
(NMSC) as well as the normal appearing peri-lesional
skin of 8 patients [57]. Using whole-mount preparation,
Jonason et al. [26] studied the clonal evolution and spread
of p53 mutant keratinocytes arising from the dermal-epi-
dermal junctions and hair follicles. Clones comprised of
60–3000 cells, and were larger and more frequent in sun-
exposed than sun-shielded skin [26]. These genetically
altered clones might await other genetic alterations to
fully demonstrate the malignant phenotype. The carcino-
genic effect of high dose therapy of psoriasis with UVA
and psoralens is known. In a study of 69 tumors, p53
mutations were present in 54% of cases [58]. These
mutant cells in multiple tumors from the same patient
were heterogeneous, suggesting they arose from different
somatic stem cell clones in cancer fields created by the
UVA and psoralen treatment.
Corroborative evidence for field cancerization in the skin
has been provided by mtDNA analysis. In NMSC, both
tumors and the normal tissue adjacent to tumor (i.e., peri-
lesional skin) contained homoplasmic UV-induced
mtDNA mutations [59]. In another study, mtDNA dele-
tions were present in both tumors and margin samples,
with margin tissues harboring more deletions than tumor
[60]. Thus, peri-lesional skin tissue might contain
expanded mutant mtDNA keratinocytes, as has been dem-
onstrated using nuclear DNA markers [26]. This suggests
that the traditional use of histologically normal peri-
lesional skin in NMSC studies may have several limita-
tions. This is important when one considers that the
majority of studies involving nuclear DNA damage and
skin cancer/skin disease often use peri-lesional skin as a
control tissue.
Gallbladder cancer
In a well designed study, a panel of normal, pre-neoplastic
and neoplastic gallbladder samples was analyzed for
mitochondrial D310 alterations. Whereas D310 abnor-
malities were infrequent in normal samples, they
increased in frequency in dysplastic lesions and normal
appearing tissue adjacent to a tumor [61]. This finding
calls for comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial
genome alterations in pre-malignant gallbladder lesions.

Bladder cancer
As the final recipient and reservoir of urine, the urothe-
lium is inevitably exposed to carcinogens, which can cre-
ate a large cancer field in this tissue resulting in multifocal
tumors. Whole organ mapping of bladder cancer fields
has been studied using a combination of LOH, p53 muta-
tion and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analy-
sis [62]. Cells were microdissected from various parts of a
cystectomised bladder for analysis. Several abnormalities
not observed in normal bladder were present in bladder
with cancer. Molecular and histopathologic data compar-
ison suggested monoclonality of multifocal lesions in
bladder cancer [62]. In another investigation, 32 tumors
from 6 bladders were analyzed using chromosomal mark-
ers [9]. Interestingly, multiple tumors from the same blad-
der harbored identical chromosomal alterations in
addition to private chromosomal changes, as is expected
of the multistep model of tumorigenesis. Indeed it is
likely that in the bladder, lesions occur in genetically
transformed but histologically normal urothelium [63].
Breast cancer
Glandular epithelial cells of the breast undergo cyclical
proliferation, which favors neoplastic transformation.
DCIS is a precancerous lesion of invasive breast cancer.
Several groups have demonstrated genomic instability in
normal breast lobules adjacent to cancer focus, and in
DCIS. LOH in normal breast tissue adjacent to breast can-
cer was reported in 8/30 cases, all of which possessed the
same missing allele as the corresponding carcinoma [16].
Analysis of LOH was performed on fine needle aspiration
(FNA) biopsy samples obtained from 30 asymptomatic
(11 with normal cytology and 19 with proliferative cytol-
ogy) women with known risk of breast cancer. LOH was
observed in 2 and 14 patients with normal cytology and
abnormal cytology respectively [64]. These findings sug-
gest that random FNA biopsy sampling of breast tissue for
molecular screening could potentially be useful in indi-
vidualized medicine. In another study, normal appearing
tissue samples were obtained from breast quadrants of 21
patients with known breast cancer for studies of LOH and
allelic imbalances [65]. Genomic instabilities were higher
in outer breast quadrants than inner quadrants. Thus, the
increased frequency of breast cancer in outer quadrants is
related to the presence of elevated genomic instabilities
[65]. LOH was also studied on samples from 30 women
with grade 1 and grade 3 DCIS, and 6 patients who subse-
quently developed invasive cancer [11]. At four chromo-
somal loci (6q, 11p, 17p and 17q), there were higher
losses in grade 3 compared to grade 1 DCIS, however, the
fractional allelic loss at 19 loci was significantly higher in
grade 1 than in grade 3 DCIS. As well, LOH in DCIS and
corresponding invasive breast cancer were heterogeneous
[11]. On the contrary, a previous study had indicated the
possible progressive nature of DCIS to invasive ductal car-
cinoma (IDC) using similar LOH analysis. In this study,
samples from 7 women with DCIS who subsequently
developed breast cancer in the same breast were exam-
ined. At 50 loci, LOH in DCIS and IDC were concordant,
and LOH appeared to accumulate with disease progres-
sion from DCIS to IDC [66]. Alterations in telomere DNA
content and allelic imbalances were demonstrated in his-
tologically normal breast tissue located at 1 cm distance
from visible tumor margin. These changes decrease as a
function of distance from the tumor margin [17].
Epigenetic gene silencing in breast cancer has been stud-
ied. Methylation of the cyclin D2 promoter appeared to be
specific to breast cancer, however, promoter methylation
of APC, RARbeta2 and RASSF1A in normal breast from
breast cancer patients was associated with increased
breasts cancer risk [67]. In a recent comprehensive study
of methylation of RASSF1A promoter in breast tissue sam-
ples, it was uncovered that primary tumors had signifi-
cantly higher promoter methylation than control
reduction mammoplasty tissue, with adjacent normal
samples having intermediate levels. Interestingly, global
profiling of DNA methylatation revealed more methyl-
ated genes in normal adjacent samples than in normal
donor control samples [68].
Prostate cancer
Compared to breast, relatively little work has been con-
ducted on field cancerization in prostate cancer. Prostate
cancer is often multifocal, and it is likely that multiple
tumors arise from an organ genetically altered by a partic-
ular carcinogen. Genomic instability, gene expression
studies and analysis of mitochondrial genome alterations
have recently been reported to show field cancerization in
prostate cancer. Methylation in GSTP1 and RARbeta2 was
present in prostate cancer, adjacent stroma and adjacent
normal glands close to tumor and were absent in normal
epithelia from benign prostatic hyperplasia [32]. Tel-
omere content alterations were observed in normal
appearing tissue close to tumors, and was shown to be a
good predictor of prostate cancer recurrence [69]. Injec-
tion of prostate cancer cell lines into athymic nude mice
caused cytogenetic abnormalities in stromal cells [70],
suggesting that at least in prostate cancer, tumor cells
might have the potential of transforming adjacent normal
glands. Gene expression signatures in normal tissue adja-
cent to a tumor focus closely resembled those of tumors
and were different from normal donor prostate samples
[19,71]. Interestingly, early prostate cancer antigen
(EPCA), which is expressed in normal tissues close to a
tumor, was shown to have elevated expression in normal
prostate glands of individuals who subsequently devel-
oped cancer years later [72,73]. The possible clonal nature
of multifocal prostate cancer is suggested by a recent
study. Laser-capture microdissection was used to procure
Cancer Cell International 2007, 7:2 http://www.cancerci.com/content/7/1/2

pure glandular epithelial cells from multifocal tumors for
gene expression studies. In any particular individual, ERG,
ETV1, and ETV4 were either over-expressed or not
expressed in all samples, suggesting alteration in these
genes could be early events in prostate cancer evolution
[74]. Prostate cancer is an age-associated disease. Interest-
ingly, a prostate cancer DNA phenotype, likely induced by
an age-associated oxidative DNA damage, was found in
some older men and in normal prostate glands adjacent
to tumors [75,76]. This cancer DNA conformation is likely
an early event in prostate cancer development since it
occurs long before tumors develop [77]. Indeed a meta-
static prostate cancer DNA phenotype was also demon-
strable in metastasizing tumors and the normal glands
surrounding these tumors, and this phenotype was differ-
ent from that of primary cancer phenotype [78]. Some of
the molecular changes in prostate cancer appear to have
excellent potential utility as early diagnostic biomarkers
[79].
Although not directly questioned, the concept of field
cancerization is indicated in a number of mtDNA muta-
tion studies of prostate cancers. Mutations in the mito-
chondrial genome were present in a co-existing precursor
lesion, PIN and matched tumor [80]. In a comprehensive
study of laser capture microdissected tissues from prosta-
tectomy specimens, we demonstrated some aspects of
field cancerization using mitochondrial genome markers
[81]. Pure populations of cells from a malignant focus and
the normal appearing cells at two distinct locations,
immediately proximal to the tumor and further away
from the tumor were obtained. MtDNA mutation load in
tumors and matched normal appearing glands were iden-
tical and these were significantly different from those
obtained from age-matched control individuals without
cancer [81]. In a follow-up study, a single large scale
mtDNA deletion associated with prostate cancer was
observed to increase in frequency in normal appearing
glands adjacent to a tumor.
Ovarian cancer
The most common ovarian cancer, serous ovarian carci-
noma, can develop following serous borderline ovarian
tumors (BOTs), suggesting the ovarian epithelium could
be genetically preconditioned by a carcinogen from which
tumors develop. Moreover, it has been the conception
that multifocal and recurrent ovarian tumors are mono-
clonal. A study of clonality using p53 and K-ras mutation
analysis in 8 patients with BOTs who later developed
serous carcinomas concluded that the tumors were unre-
lated [82]. Likely, distinct genetic alterations in a precon-
ditioned epithelium may lead to BOTs and serous
carcinomas independently. Analysis of 13 primary and
corresponding recurrent ovarian tumors using four mark-
ers of genomic instability indicated 10/13 were different,
with the rest being identical [83]. Promoter methylation
status of hMLH1, CDKN2A, and MGMT in synchronous
independent ovarian and endometrial cancers was stud-
ied for the possible origin of these tumors from a canceri-
zation field. High frequency of promoter methylation of
CDKC2A and MGMT were found in both endometrial and
ovarian carcinomas, suggesting the epigenetic silencing of
these genes could be an early event in the development of
these synchronous cancers [30].
Pancreatic cancer
Multiple intraductal papillary tumors of the pancreas are
common, and a precancerous lesion of pancreatic adeno-
carcinoma is ductal hyperplasia. Therefore could pancre-
atic cancers arise from genetically transformed but normal
ductal epithelium? Mutations in K-ras are early important
events in pancreatic ductal carcinoma and non-neoplastic
pancreatic ductal lesions. Therefore, these markers have
been used for several studies of pancreatic cancer evolu-
tion. Microdissected tumors and associated ductal hyper-
plastic tissue from 37 patients for K-ras mutation and X-
chromosome inactivation analyses demonstrated distinct
genomic abnormalities in hyperplasia as well as pancre-
atic cancer. This study concluded that polyclonal multi-
centric pancreatic cancers originate form epithelium with
early genetic changes [84]. In a study of microdissected
samples from 20 intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors
(IPMT) and 7 ductal adenocarcinoma, K-ras mutations
were noted in 66.7% of peri-tumoral tissue and 62.5% of
separate IPMT lesions, and at least one identical mutation
was observed in the tumor and peritumoral tissue in all
IPMT patients with those lesions [31]. K-ras mutation as a
marker of disease progression has been demonstrated.
Analysis of 46 different histologic grades of IPMT from 16
patients and 9 with ductal adenocarcinoma reveal an
increased frequency of K-ras mutation from 16.7% in nor-
mal epithelium and papillary hyperplasia, to 57.1% in
high grade dysplasia, carcinoma in situ and invasive can-
cer [85].
Conceptualization of field cancerization in other
tumors
Hematologic oncology
It has been proposed that generalized insults to bone mar-
row can lead to simultaneous generation of many abnor-
mal bone marrow clones. Therefore admixture of cells
representing severe aplastic anemia, acute promyelocytic
leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplas-
tic syndrome, can be present in the same bone marrow,
and that proliferative advantage of one clone results in its
dominant appearance and thus specific diagnosis. The
term "field leukemogenic effect" was used to describe this
phenomenon [33]. It will be interesting to know whether
the ecological and evolutionary concepts used to predict
Cancer Cell International 2007, 7:2 http://www.cancerci.com/content/7/1/2
Page 8 of 12
(page number not for citation purposes)
progression in Barrett's esophagus to adenocarcinoma
[49] applies here as well.
Heteroplasmy is an early indicator of disease, and in
oncology, this could probably be an indicator of field can-
cerization. The dynamics of mitochondrial genome
changes was shown in association with the progression of
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to acute myeloid leuke-
mia (AML) [86]. MDS are clonal myeloid disorders that
can transform to AML. A heteroplasmic mtDNA mutation
in MDS was observed to increase with disease evolution
until the final stage of AML when the mutant copy became
homoplasmic. This sequencing data was confirmed using
restriction digest analysis by showing that the mtDNA
mutation load positively correlated with progression from
MDS to AML [86]. These findings are indeed very interest-
ing, and importantly emphasize the need for sensitive
sequencing methods for heteroplasmy detection.
Neuro-oncology
Gliomatosis cerebri (GC) is a rare neoplasm of the brain
with extensive distribution, usually involving both lobes
and even occasionally infratentorial regions. Could this
lesion therefore arise from a vast field of preconditioned
neural tissue? In one study of GC, 24 tissue samples were
randomly obtained from several brain areas for study.
Genome-wide scan for chromosomal aberrations, p53
mutation analysis and LOH were performed on all sam-
ples. Mutations in p53 were present in 20/24 cases, with
chromosomal loses and allelic imbalances in several other
tumor samples [34]. In a separate series, mtDNA was used
as a clonal marker for GC, and consistent band losses were
observed in all tumor samples from two individuals, one
of who also had p53 mutations [87].
The need for appropriate control tissue in
cancer studies
An important message from the above review of the liter-
ature is that using histologically normal appearing sam-
ples as the sole control tissue in cancer research is
probably inappropriate [88]. At its minimum, the use of
donor tissues (ideally obtained under similar conditions
as tumor) will serve as better controls for tumor-specific
biomarker discovery. Donor control, in addition to nor-
mal adjacent to tumors, precancerous lesions, and tumor
samples will provide the best sample set for resolution of
genetic alterations that are relevant to the disease process.
If normal adjacent to tumor tissue must be used as the
only normal control, it should first be examined for the
absence of genetic abnormalities [88]. In skin cancer stud-
ies for example, additional analysis of UV-induced dam-
age in sun protected skin from the same individual would
provide a complementary isogenic control. With regards
to mtDNA analysis, it is regrettable that a number of
investigators are still using normal appearing cells in the
presence of tumors as normal maternal germline control
tissue from which somatic mtDNA mutations could be
unraveled [89-97]. Obviously this will lead to erroneous
mutations being associated with the disease processes,
since the adjacent normal tissue in a cancerization field
may sustain somatic mtDNA mutations as well. Compar-
ison to the mtDNA profile of the individual's blood,
which we have determined to be the authentic germline
mitochondrial genome, is necessary.
Clinical implications
Risk assessment, early detection, chemoprevention, and
disease progression
Biomarkers present in tumors and not in normal appear-
ing cells close to a tumor are thought to be useful for early
detection of cancer. Usually such tumor-specific biomark-
ers are validated and used for screening to diagnose organ
confined tumors that have better treatment outlook. In
some instances, early detection strategies such as molecu-
lar profiling of circulating tumor cells rather indicate the
presence of metastasis [98]. Future biomarker discovery
and validation efforts should focus on identification of
biosensors that signal the genesis of disease, rather than
biomarkers of the disease. Such biosensors will be useful
in risk assessment, early detection, disease monitoring,
and chemoprevention. For example, LOH in normal
breast epithelial cells obtained by random FNA biopsy
from women with known risk of breast cancer was used to
predict breast cancer risk [64]. In this study, the Gail risk
model predicted a mean lifetime breast cancer risk of
16.7% for women with no LOH compared to 22.9% for
women with LOH [64]. These markers thus correlate with
individual risk of developing breast cancer, and thus seem
useful for early detection and risk assessment of breast
cancer. Genetic changes present in normal appearing cells
can be used for identification and recruitment of individ-
uals at risk of developing cancer for primary chemopre-
vention (i.e., to prevent de novo development of cancers).
Indeed, epigenetic gene silencing through promoter
hypermethylation and transcriptional repression of sev-
eral tumor-associated genes is an early event in several
cancers including breast, prostate, colorectal, gastric, and
ovarian cancers. Importantly, reversal of epigenetic events
with agents such as hydralazine, 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine,
zebularine, and magnesium valporate is possible. Knowl-
edge of methylation patterns and their role in malignant
transformation will enable controlled use of mehtylation
reversal agents in primary chemoprevention. Similarly,
relevant markers present in precancerous lesions will be
useful endpoint measures or targets of secondary chemo-
prevention (i.e., to prevent the progression of pre-malig-
nant lesions to invasive cancers). Importantly, biofluids,
representative of cells from a particular organ may serve as
useful noninvasive or minimally invasive samples for dis-
ease surveillance. For instance, genetic changes preceding
Cancer Cell International 2007, 7:2 http://www.cancerci.com/content/7/1/2

breast cancer development might be detectable in nipple
aspirate fluids.
Multistep field cancerization indicates two levels of cancer
progression: molecular progression whereby histologically
normal looking cells undergo sequential cumulative
acquisition of genomic damage, and phenotypic progression
whereby a neoplastic cell accumulates genetic alterations
and undergoes further phenotypic changes (e.g., from
intraepithelial neoplasia to various stages of invasive can-
cer). Functionally relevant pathways altered at the molec-
ular progression phase should uncover useful biosensors
for early detection and monitoring of cancer. It is also well
known that not all precancerous lesions progress to inva-
sive cancers [1]. Thus, molecular profiling of early lesions
using appropriate control tissue will enable important
pathways or biomarkers that predict disease progression
to be deciphered. In a recent elegant study, laser-capture
microdissection was used to procure pure population of
cells at various stages of prostate cancer development for
gene expression profiling. Using a novel analytical
approach referred to as "molecular concept model", sev-
eral genes and pathways were identified that represented
molecular progression of prostate cancer from benign
through prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia to prostate
cancer. Increased expression of genes involved in cell cycle
regulation, and on 8q was associated with disease progres-
sion [74]. The estimated progression of an atypical hyper-
plasia to an adenocarcinoma may occur over a period of
5–20 years. This prolonged time course provides opportu-
nities for early detection within an activated pre-cancer-
ous epithelial field [1,2].
An important clinical utility of field cancerization is in
complementary evaluation of pathologic biopsy speci-
men. Currently, biopsies for cancer diagnosis are reviewed
by histology, the gold standard, and the absence of abnor-
mal cells often precludes the diagnosis of cancer. How-
ever, histologically normal biopsy specimen that possess
molecular signatures of cancer fields suggest either the
tumor was missed by the biopsy procedure, or that some
cells in the tissue are progressing towards malignancy.
Such high risk patients will require close surveillance for
early detection of disease.
Tumor margins and recurrences
Tumor recurrences are common in surgical oncology.
Depending on the type of tumors, recurrent rates could be
as high as 50% [99]. There are two types of local tumor
recurrences; those that occur at the primary site of surgical
recurrence (local or scar recurrence), and those that occur
at a distance from the surgical scar in the residual organ
left after resection of the primary tumor (in situ recurrence,
second primary tumor (SPT) or second field tumors
(SFT)). In situ recurrences that are genetically similar to
the primary tumor are referred to as SFT, and those that
are genetically dissimilar to the primary are identified as
true SPT. Field cancerization may have an etiologic role in
a substantial number of recurrences. For example, a surgi-
cal resection margin that includes a genetically altered
field can explain the occurrence of scar recurrence. This
explanation suggests that molecular profiling of surgical
margins will help reduce scar recurrences. Since multiple
independent patches of cancer fields may be present in
the same organ exposed to the same insult, clean molecu-
lar margins may not necessarily prevent recurrences in the
residual organ. Nonetheless, complementary molecular
assessment of tumor margins should at least help reduce
tumor recurrences. For instance, in pancreatic cancer,
analysis of K-ras codon 12 mutation in histologically nor-
mal surgical margin tissues from 70 patients could have
prognostic significance. In this study, 53% of patients
with positive molecular margins had unfavorable overall
survival outcome [100].
Conclusion
Field cancerization is a well known and well documented
process of malignant transformation. Several studies con-
firm the importance of this phenomenon in tumor devel-
opment. With technological advancement, the future
should benefit from well designed studies aimed at iden-
tifying genetic markers and pathways useful in disease
management. An obvious shortcoming in almost all the
studies of field cancerization is the lack of extensive
genome-wide scans that will enable early and important
genetic changes in tumor evolution to be uncovered.
Many studies have relied heavily on known markers asso-
ciated with a particular tumor. Such selected tumor mark-
ers might be later acquisitions in the disease process, and
will be missed in peri-tumoral samples or precancerous
lesions. Comprehensive high-throughput analyses for the
discovery of early and relevant genetic changes that extend
across global networks and represent modular alterations
of multiple targets (or surrogates) of terminal histologi-
cally differentiated stages of cancer subtypes will be essen-
tial for early detection, risk assessment and primary
chemoprevention.
