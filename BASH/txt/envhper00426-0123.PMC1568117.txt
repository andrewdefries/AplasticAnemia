Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of benzene (CAS No. 71-43-2; greater than 99.7% pure) were conducted
in groups of60 F344/N rats and 60 B6C3FW mice ofeach sex for each of three exposure doses and vehicle con-
trols. These composite studies on benzene were designed and conducted because of large production volume
and widespread human exposure, because ofthe epidemiologic association with leukemia, and because previ.
ous experiments were considered inadequate or inconclusive for determining carcinogenicity in laboratory
animals. Using the results from 17-week studies, doses for the 2-year studies were selected based on clinical
observations (tremors in higher dosed mice), on clinical pathologic findings (lymphoid depletion in rats and
leukopenia in mice), and on body weight effects. Doses of 0, 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg body weight benzene in
corn oil were administered by gavage to male rats, 5 days per week, for 103 weeks. Doses of 0, 25, 50, or 100
mg/kg benzene in corn oil were administered by gavage to female rats and to male and female mice for 103
weeks. Ten animals in each ofthe 16 groups were killed at 12 months, and necropsies were performed. Hemato-
logic profiles were performed at 3-month intervals.
For the 2-year studies, mean body weights of the top dose groups of male rats and of both sexes of mice
were lower than those ofthe controls. Survivals ofthe top dose group ofrats and mice ofeach sex were reduced;
however, at week 92 for rats and week 91 for mice, survival was greater than 60% in all groups; most of the
dosed animals that died before week 103 had neoplasia. Compound-related nonneoplastic or neoplastic ef-
fects on the hematopoietic system, Zymbal gland, forestomach, and adrenal gland were found both for rats
and mice. Further, the oral cavity was affected in rats, and the lung, liver, Harderian gland, preputial gland,
ovary, and mammary gland were affected in mice. Under the conditions ofthese 2-year gavage studies, there
was clear evidence ofcarcinogenicity ofbenzene in male F344/N rats, female F344/N rats, male B6C3FW mice,
and female B6C3FM mice. In male rats, benzene caused increased incidences of Zymbal gland carcinomas,
squamous cell papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, and squamous cell papillomas
and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. In female rats, benzene caused increased incidences of Zymbal
gland carcinomas and squamous cell papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity. In male
mice, benzene caused increased incidences ofZymbal gland squamous cell carcinomas, malignant lymphomas,
alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas and alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas (combined), Harderian
gland adenomas, and squamous cell carcinomas of the preputial gland. In female mice, benzene caused in-
creased incidences ofmalignant lymphomas, ovarian granulosa cell tumors, ovarian benign mixed tumors,
carcinomas and careinosarcomas ofthe mammary gland, alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas, alveolar/bronchiolar
carcinomas, and Zymbal gland squamous cell carcinomas. Dose-related lymphocytopenia was observed for
male and female F344/N rats and male and female B6C3F, mice. These unequivocal observations show clearly
that benzene is a trans-species, trans-sex, multisite potent carcinogen.

data interpretations, and conclusions. Relevant back-
ground information regarding benzene has been included
on production and use, exposure and standards, human
health effects, genetic toxicology, and carcinogenesis
studies of benzene metabolites. Benzene represents one
of nearly 400 chemical-specific, long-term carcinogenesis
studies conducted in rodents and reported in a series of
technical reports by the National Cancer Institute, for
the first 200 chemicals (3,4), and by the National Toxicol-
ogy Program for the subsequent 175 chemicals (5,6).
Production, Use, and Occurrence
Benzene ranks 16th in production volume for chemicals
produced in the United States, with approximately 11.84
billion pounds being produced in 1988, 11.7 billion pounds
in 1987, 10.2 billion pounds in 1986, and 9.4 billion pounds
in 1985 (7). Considering only organic chemicals benzene
places sixth. This simplest aromatic chemical is used pri-
marily as a raw material in the synthesis ofstyrene (poly-
styrene plastics and synthetic rubber), phenol (phenolic
resins), cyclohexane (nylon), aniline, maleic anhydride
(polyester resins), alkylbenzenes (detergents), chloroben-
zenes, and other products used in the production ofdrugs,
dyes, insecticides, and plastics (8). Benzene, along with
other light, high-octane aromatic hydrocarbons, such as
toluene and xylenes, is a component of motor gasoline.
Benzene is also used as a solvent, but for most applica-
tions, it has been replaced by what are considered less
hazardous solvents.
Benzene has a long history of extensive use in indus-
try, first as a volatile solvent and later as a starting mate-
rial for the synthesis ofother chemicals. An aromatic frac-
tion containing benzene was known in the 18th century
as a product of the distillation of coal (8). Benzene, or bi-
carburet of hydrogen as it was then called, was first iso-
lated in 1825 by Faraday, who obtained it from a liquid
condensed by compressing oil gas. In 1833, Mitscherlich
obtained bicarburet of hydrogen by distilling benzoic acid
with lime and suggested the name "benzin" for the com-
pound. Leibig objected and proposed "benzole." In 1845,
benzene was found by Hoffman in light oil derived from
coal tar. The commercial recovery of benzene from this
source was developed and described by Mansfield in 1849.
The synthesis ofbenzene by the polymerization ofacety-
lene was first carried out by Berthelot in 1866. Discov-
ery of benzene in coal gas after 1876 initiated the recov-
ery of coal gas light oil as a source of benzene. Although
petroleum was known to contain benzene, recovery of
this material was not undertaken on a commercial scale
until about 1941. Several years after the end of World
War II, the demand for benzene by the rapidly expand-
ing chemical industry exceeded the total production by
the coal carbonization industry. To help meet this deficit,
benzene was produced in ever increasing amounts by the
petroleum and petrochemical industries by the recovery
from reformate and liquid byproducts and ethylene
manufacture. Today, production from these sources far
exceeds that from coal.
Benzene, the parent hydrocarbon ofa series ofaromatic
compounds, should not be confused with the product ben-
zin or benzine, a comparatively low boiling point
petroleum fraction consisting of a mixture of hydrocar-
bons, predominantly aliphatic in type. The term "benzol"
is used to describe commercial products that are largely
benzene; the term is rarely seen in the United States but
is still found in British publications. The pure compound
is now called benzene, the name approved by the Inter-
national Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and
adopted by industries and nomenclature experts.
Benzene recovered from both petroleum and coal
sources is extracted from catalytic reformate made in oil
refineries, from pyrolysis gasoline made in steam-
cracking olefin plants, from light oils in coking coal, and
from dealkylation of toluene (9). The major derivatives of
benzene are ethylbenzene (50%), cumene (15%), cyclohex-
ane (15%), and aniline (5%). Primary end uses include
polystyrene (25%), nylon (20%), other styrenic polymers
(10%), and rubber (5%). As an antiknock chemical, ben-
zene and benzene-enriched aromatics are added to gaso-
line as a replacement for alkyl lead compounds. The ben-
zene content of European motor fuel is about 5% (10);
U.S. gasoline contains an average of 0.8% (11).
Benzene is apparently ubiquitous in the environment.
The main source of benzene in the environment is from
industrial processes. However, benzene is a natural con-
stituent of crude oil (12). Early uses of benzene as a sol-
vent regularly resulted in workplace air concentrations
of 1600 to 3200 mg/m3 (approximately 500 to 1000 ppm)
and above (11). In addition to the major source ofbenzene
in the environment (industry), benzene is found in air, wa-
ter, and sediments; soil and plants; food, beverages, and
feed; tobacco and tobacco smoke; and pyrolysis products.
Human Exposure
Hunter chronicles the history oflong-term benzene ex-
posure (13); a few early facts are given here for historic
interest. In the last years ofthe 19th century, the use of
benzene as a rubber solvent led to small outbreaks of
"purpura hemorrhagica" with a number of deaths from
aplastic anemia. Selling was the first to associate benzene
poisoning with leukopenia (14). Unfortunately, this asso-
ciation led to using benzene in the treatment ofleukemia;
benzene was given in gelatin capsules starting with 3 g
per day and increasing to 5 g per day. The result was a
gain in weight, shrinkage of the spleen, and great reduc-
tion of the white cell count. After some months of treat-
ment, however, most patients developed multiple hemor-
rhages, especially from the fauces and gums; women
experienced troublesome menorrhagia. With advancing
anemia (loss of white and red blood cells), fever, and
bleeding, these patients died of chronic poisoning. For-
tunately, this clinical application was discontinued by
1913. In most industrial countries, the use ofbenzene as
a solvent increased after World War I. In 1922, Alice
Hamilton began her efforts to reduce the hazards ofben-
zene in American industry. Early recognition ofthe seri-
126
PANCARCINOGENESIS OF BENZENE
ous adverse health effects ofbenzene (1) stimulated many
industries in 1928 to change their attitudes and use safer
alternatives for benzene, even when more expensive (13).
Toluene was substituted for benzene in dry cleaning and
in thinners used for quick-drying paints. Cellulose lac-
quers sprayed onto motor-car bodies were dissolved in
toluene instead of benzene. Current toxicological data
support the substitution decisions made in the 1920s.
However, in 1939 three plants were found that used
about 50,000 gallons of benzene per month, and benzene
concentrations in the workrooms ranged from 11 to 1060
ppm (13). Ofthe 332 workers examined, 130 showed vary-
ing degrees ofbenzene poisoning. The use ofbenzene was
discontinued in these three rotogravure operations, and
other solvents were used.
Workplace and environmental exposure to benzene is
widespread. As many as 2 million workers may be ex-
posed (12,15). Nonoccupational exposure to benzene
results primarily from environmental contamination, the
chief sources being automobile refueling operations and
emissions, consumer products, industrial emission, and
cigarette smoke. Benzene intake by urban residents in
the U.S. is approximately 850 M4g/day (16). For example,
benzene is present in cigarette smoke at concentrations
of47 to 64 ppm (17); dietary intake may be as high as 250
,ug/day (16). Benzene has also been identified in bottled
artesian water (18) and in boiled beef and canned beef
stew (19). The average background benzene concentra-
tion in urban areas ranges from about 1.5 to 6 ppb (20).
Two studies have shown considerable benzene absorp-
tion via skin. Susten et al. (21), using hairless mice, cal-
culated that 20 to 40% ofthe total benzene dose received
by humans in tire-building operations could be absorbed
dermally. Blank and McAuliffe (22) calculated that an
adult working in ambient air containing 10 ppm benzene
would absorb 7.5 ,uL/hr from inhalation and 1.5 ML/hr
from whole body (2 m2) exposure. They also calculated
that 100 cm2 glabrous skin in contact with gasoline con-
taining 5% benzene would absorb 7.0 ML/hr. These results
are not too different from those of Susten et al. using
mouse skin (21).
Exposure Standard
Adopted in 1971, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) standard for benzene was an 8-hr
time-weighted average (TWA) of 10 ppm with a ceiling
limit of25 ppm and a maximum peak concentration of50
ppm for a 10-min period (23). The standard apparently
was based on concern about the development of aplastic
anemia and depression ofvarious cellular elements in the
blood, but not on concern about the development of can-
cer. In May 1977, OSHA issued an Emergency Tem-
porary Standard that reduced exposures to benzene to
1 ppm and included other provisions. In February 1978,
OSHA promulgated a new permanent standard for oc-
cupational exposure to benzene based on evidence that
there was a causal connection between benzene exposure
and leukemia. This standard limited employee exposure
to 1 ppm as an 8-hr TWA, then estimated to be the lowest
feasible level. The standard included a ceiling limit of 5
ppm for any 15-min period during an 8-hr day, limits on
eye and skin contact with benzene, and industrial hygiene
and medical surveillance provisions.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir-
cuit vacated the standard in 1978, and the Supreme Court
affirmed thatjudgment in 1980. The Supreme Court held
that OSHA's prior approach (reducing exposures to the
lowest feasible level when there was strong qualitative
evidence of carcinogenicity) was insufficient. In Decem-
ber 1985, OSHA issued a newly proposed rule and notice
of hearing on occupational exposure to benzene (23). In
this announcement, OSHA "proposes to reduce the ex-
isting benzene permissible exposure limit of 10 parts ben-
zene per million parts of air (10 ppm) to an eight (8)-hour
time-weighted average of 1 ppm to reduce substantially
a significant health risk." The then current 10-ppm ex-
posure limit in the U.S. corresponded to that in most
other industrialized countries, except for Sweden (5 ppm)
and the USSR (5 mg/m3, approximately equivalent to 2
ppm) (24).
In September 1987, OSHA announced a final rule on oc-
cupational exposure to benzene: "The revised standard
reduces the permissible exposure limit (PEL) from 10
parts benzene per million parts of air (10 ppm) to an eight
(8)-hour time-weighted average (TWA) of 1 ppm and a
short-tenn exposure limit (STEL) of 5 ppm [reduced from
25 ppm]. An action level of 0.5 ppm is established to en-
courage lower exposures for employees and to reduce ad-
ministrative burdens to employers. This standard applies
to all industries covered by the Occupational Safety and
Health Act" (25).
Metabolism and Excretion
After monosubstitution ofbenzene has occurred, three
disubstitution positions are chemically possible: 1,2- (or-
tho); 1,3- (meta); or 1,4- (para). Electron-withdrawing
groups promote meta substitutions and electron donat-
ing groups favor ortho and para substitutions. Since most
benzene metabolites are hydroxyl additions, the ortho
para positions predominate (8). Following metabolic for-
mation ofphenol (C6H5OH), further metabolism leads to
both catechol (pyrocatechol; ortho-dihydroxybenzene) and
hydroquinone (para-dihydroxybenzene). The third possi-
ble form, meta-dihydroxybenzene (resorcinol), probably
does not occur. As described by Irons and Pfeifer (26), the
primary oxidation ofbenzene occurs via the cytochrome
P-450-dependent monooxygenase system, resulting in bi-
ologically reactive intermediates. As generally agreed,
benzene per se does not represent the principal structural
moiety causing the identified toxic effects on the bone
marrow or lymphoid system (26,27). The metabolism and
elimination ofbenzene in humans appear to be similar to
those in rats and mice; the amounts of various metabo-
lites, the extent ofmetabolism, and the nature ofthe phe-
nol conjugates depend on the species, strain, and the
route of administration (28).

Comparative metabolism and disposition studies ofben-
zene and its metabolites in selected tissues in F344 rats
and B6C3Fi mice are being conducted by the oral and in-
halation routes (29-32).
Genetic Toxicology of Benzene
The genetic toxicology of benzene and other solvents
(toluene, xylenes, phenols) has been summarized by Dean
(33) and Kalf(34). This section highlights the past and cur-
rent literature.
Bacterial Systems
Many studies have shown that benzene is not muta-
genic in bacteria. Eight strains of Salmonella have been
used, and rat liver S9 has been prepared from uninduced
animals and from animals induced with 3-methyl-
cholanthrene, phenobarbital, or Aroclor 1254 (35-43). Al-
though all of these studies used the standard plate-
incorporation assay described by Ames et al. (44), nega-
tive results were obtained in a host-mediated assay that
consisted of strain TA1950 injected IP into Swiss albino
mice; the mice then received two SC 0.1-mL injections of
benzene at 1-hr intervals (45). Bartsch et al. (46) exposed
strains TA98 and TA100 in inverted Petri dishes at con-
centrations less than or equal to 20% benzene (v/v) in air
in a 10-L desiccator for 4 or 12 hr at 370C. The results
were negative in the presence or absence of Aroclor-
induced rat liver S9. Similarly, Bos et al. (47) used the
taped-plate assay for volatile compounds and obtained
negative results.
Although all ofthese studies were reverse-mutation as-
says at a histidine gene in Salmonella, a forward-mutation
assay in Salmonella for resistance to 8-azaguanine also
failed to detect any mutagenic activity ofbenzene (48,49).
Benzene not only failed to revert a variety of strains of
Salmonella but also did not revert a histidine auxotroph
of Bacillus subtilis (50). Although McCarroll (51,52)
reported that benzene caused growth inhibition by
producing DNA damage in B. subtilis and Escherichia
coli, Rosenkranz and Leifer (53) found that benzene was
negative in the E. coli pol A test. Likewise, benzene did
not cause DNA damage in SOS-induction assays in E. coli
(43) or S. typhimurium (54).
Nonmammalian Eukaryotic Systems
Benzene failed to induce petites and gene conver-
sion/crossing over in yeast (55,56); however, it did induce
aneuploidy in yeast (57). Benzene was negative for so-
matic mutation in Drosophila melanogaster in an early
study by Nylander et al. (58); however, it was positive in
the wing-spot assay (59). Benzene was generally negative
for germ cell mutation (sex-linked recessive lethals) in
Drosophila (60,61), and the results have been summarized
by Vogel (62). Exposure ofthe vascular plant Tradescan-
tia resulted in mutations (63,64), and benzene caused
chromosomal anomalies in the grasshopper (65).
Mammalian Cells In Vitro
Benzene was not mutagenic in the mouse lymphoma
forward-mutation assay in L5178Y/TK + / - cells (66). In
a series of studies summarized by Garner (67), benzene
was not mutagenic in a variety of cell lines from mouse
(L5178Y), hamster (CHO, V79), and human (TK6) at var-
ious loci (hprt, tk, ouar). Three studies in primary rat
hepatocytes (68-70) and two in HeLa cells (71,72) found
no evidence that benzene could induce unscheduled DNA
synthesis (UDS), which is an indicator of DNA damage.
However, Glauert et al. did find evidence that benzene
induced UDS in primary rat hepatocytes (73). Benzene
also induced DNA strand breakage in L5178Y mouse
lymphoma cells (74).
Koizumi et al. (75) found that benzene induced chromo-
some breaks and gaps in cultured human leukocytes, but
high doses and long exposure times were required to pro-
duce the chromosomal abnormalities. Morimoto reported
that treatment ofcultured human lymphocytes with ben-
zene at high doses for long exposure times caused chro-
mosomal abnormalities (76), including acentric fragments,
breaks, and gaps. Howard et al. also found that benzene
induced chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes
(77). These observations were not confirmed by Gerner-
Smidt and Friedrich (78), who treated cultured human
lymphocytes with benzene for 72 hr and found no increase
in chromosomal aberrations. Two studies found that ben-
zene induced chromosomal aberrations in hamster cells
(79,80), but these were not confirmed in other studies nor
in other cell types (81).
Several studies found that benzene did not induce
SCEs in human lymphocytes (78,80,82) or rodent cells
(81). However, with increased levels of S9 or benzene,
three studies found that benzene induced SCEs in human
lymphocytes (83-85). Benzene also was found to induce
aneuploidy in Chinese hamster liver cells (86).
Benzene induced mammalian cell transformation in
SHE cells (87-89). However, it was negative in a number
of other cell transformation assays (90).
Mammals In Vivo
Although benzene has given mixed results for the in-
duction of SCEs and for chromosomal aberrations in
vitro, it is one ofthe few compounds that has been tested
extensively for a variety of cytogenetic effects in vivo.
There are now many studies that show that benzene
causes cytogenetic damage in rodents in vivo; of these,
13 are in mice, 5 are in rats, and 1 is in rabbits. However,
benzene failed to induce cytogenetic damage in hamsters.
Micronuclei. Micronuclei are chromosomes or small
fragments of chromosomes that are not incorporated into
daughter nuclei during cell division. They may be induced
by agents that break chromosomes (clastogens) or that
affect the spindle apparatus. The ability ofbenzene to in-
duce micronuclei in the bone marrow polychromatic
erythrocytes ofmice has been confirmed by numerous in-
dependent studies in various strains of mice.
Diaz et al. (91) and Tunek et al. (92) administered ben-
128
PANCARCINOGENESIS OF BENZENE
zene SC to male mice (the F1 from the cross CSW x Cs
No. 1 or outbred NMRI) and observed a dose-dependent
increase in micronuclei. Benzene was administered by
gavage to male and female mice in the following three
studies. Hite et al. (93) found that benzene induced simi-
lar dose-dependent increases in micronuclei in both sexes
of Charles River (CD-1) mice. Meyne and Legator (94)
and Siou et al. (95), who used Swiss (CD-1) and Swiss
Lane Petter mice, respectively, also found that benzene
induced micronuclei in both sexes, but with greater dose-
dependent increases in micronuclei in males than in fe-
males. This was confirmed by Gad-El-Karim et al. (96).
Siou et al. (95) showed that castration of male mice
reduced their sensitivity for micronuclei formation below
that of the females. Meyne and Legator (94) found that
IP injections of benzene produced a dose-dependent in-
crease in micronuclei in male mice and yet caused no in-
crease in micronuclei in females. The NTP found that
benzene administered by gavage induced micronuclei in
male and female B6C3F1 mice; males were more sensi-
tive than females (97). Additional evidence of the ability
of benzene to induce micronuclei in mice has been found
by Gad-El-Karim et al. (98) and Harper and Legator (99).
An inhalation study in male DBA/2 mice found that ben-
zene induced micronuclei in bone marrow after exposure
to a single target concentration ofjust 10 ppm ofbenzene
for 6 hr (100).
In male Long-Evans rats, IP injections of benzene in-
duced a dose-dependent increase in micronuclei, and the
doses were similar to those that induced micronuclei in
mice (45). Micronuclei were also induced in bone marrow
of male Sprague-Dawley rats (11-14 weeks old) exposed
by inhalation to a target concentration ofbenzene as low
as 1 ppm for 6 hr (100). Although benzene induced
micronuclei in mice and rats, Siou et al. (95) did not find
an increase in micronuclei in hamsters that received ben-
zene by gavage.
Chromosomal Aberrations. Meyne and Legator (94)
reported that exposure of Swiss (CD-1) mice to benzene
by gavage or IP injection increased the frequency of chro-
mosomal aberrations and that males were more sensitive
than females. However, Tice et al. (101) found that ex-
posure of DBA/2 mice to benzene by inhalation caused an
increase in chromosomal aberrations only when the
animals had been pretreated with phenobarbital. The
authors also showed that the combination ofbenzene and
phenobarbital inhibited cellular proliferation in the bone
marrow; once again, males were more sensitive to this in-
hibition than were females. Subsequent studies (102)
showed that the combination of benzene and phenobar-
bital enhanced the frequency of chromosomal aberrations
in males more than in females. The aberrations were all
of the chromatid type, not of the chromosome type, and
there were no increases in chromosomal rearrangement
of any kind. Siou et al. (95) confirmed the observations of
Meyne and Legator (94) by administering benzene by
gavage to Swiss Lane Petter mice: Chromosome gaps
were enhanced in both sexes, and males were more sen-
sitive than females. Gad-El-Karim et al. (96) found that
benzene induced chromosomal aberrations in CD-1 mice,
and Rithidech et al. (103) found that benzene induced
chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes of Swiss (ICR)
male mice.
Four reports show that benzene induces chromosomal
aberrations in rats. Lyon (45) injected benzene IP into
male Long-Evans rats and found a significant increase in
chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells, including
achromatic lesions, chromatid and chromosome deletions,
and double minutes (small supernumerary chromosomal
fragments). Dean (104) reported that benzene injected IP
to Carworth CFi rats increased the number of chromatid
gaps and chromosome fragments in bone marrow cells
from both sexes. Anderson and Richardson (105) exam-
ined the ability of benzene to induce chromosomal aber-
rations in the bone marrow cells of Wistar-derived male
Alderly Park rats. Exposure by inhalation or injection in-
creased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations. No
dose response was observed, and a single exposure was
as effective as multiple doses. Styles and Richardson (106)
found that benzene induced chromosomal aberrations in
male Wistar-derived rats when exposed by inhalation to
benzene at 100 ppm for 6 hr.
A significant increase in chromosomal aberrations,
mostly gaps and breaks, was found in rabbits injected SC
with benzene (107). Although benzene induces chro-
mosomal aberrations in mice, rats, and rabbits, a similar
effect has not been seen in Chinese hamsters. Siou et al.
(95) administered benzene by gavage to Chinese hamsters
and reported no increase in chromosomal aberrations.
Sister Chromatid Exchanges. The ability of benzene
to induce SCEs in mice was reported by Tice et al.
(101,102). Inhaled benzene enhanced the frequency of
SCEs in male and female DBA/2 mice, but more so in
males. Three-month-old mice were more sensitive than
were 10-month-old mice. The authors also compared ef-
fects resulting from two different routes of exposure and
found that inhalation of 120 ppm of benzene for 4 hr
equaled the effect of an IP injection of 1 mmole/kg. The
authors have tentatively concluded that a greater in-
crease in SCEs resulted from inhaled benzene than from
injected benzene. In contrast to their other findings,
these authors also found that treatment with phenobar-
bital before inhalation ofbenzene enhanced SCEs in male
and female mice but more so in females. Inhaled benzene
also caused a greater increase in SCEs in DBA/2 mice
than in C57BL/6 mice. These two strains are isogenic and
vary in that DBA/2 mice have no inducible aryl hydrocar-
bon hydroxylase (AHH) activity, whereas the C57BL/6
strain does. Erexson et al. (100) found that inhalation of
10 ppm by male DBA/2 mice or 3 ppm by male Sprague-
Dawley rats resulted in significant increases in SCE fre-
quencies in peripheral blood lymphocytes.
Other End Points. An additional end point, sperm-
head abnormalities, has been studied by Topham (108),
who showed that hybrid mice (CBA x BALB/c) given IP
injections of benzene exhibited small but reproducible
and significant increases in sperm-head abnormalities.
Earlier, Lyon (45) found that IP injections ofbenzene in
Long-Evans rats at 0.5 mL/kg (one-fifth the LD5o value)
did not increase the frequency of dominant lethals.

Cytogenetic Studies in Humans
Benzene is one ofthe few agents whose cytogenetic ef-
fects have been studied in humans. The populations
studied can be divided into two general groups: people
with a current or past history ofbenzene-associated blood
dyscrasias, and workers with current or past exposure
to benzene but with no apparent clinical signs of blood
dyscrasias. In many of the 23 studies (11), significant in-
creases in chromosomal aberrations were observed,
which in some cases persisted for years after exposure
ceased. Most ofthese studies involved small numbers of
humans exposed to benzene and did not present detailed
information about the concentration and length of ex-
posure. Although the data do not support a clear associ-
ation between exposure to benzene and persistent chro-
mosomal aberrations, the data do indicate an association
between benzene-associated hemopathies and chro-
mosomal aberrations (33,34).
In summary, these studies show that benzene is clearly
a clastogen and that benzene causes other chromosomal
changes. It is not clear if benzene is a gene mutagen, an
agent that causes a molecular change that affects only a
single gene, as opposed to a chromosomal (multiple gene)
mutagen. In addition, benzene must be metabolized in
vivo to cause chromosomal changes, suggesting that
metabolites of benzene are responsible for any observed
cytogenetic changes. In general, male rodents are more
sensitive than females to the genotoxic effects ofbenzene,
and the route of administration influences the ability of
benzene to induce chromosomal damage. Cytogenetic
damage also has been observed in humans who have de-
veloped benzene-associated hemopathies, especially
leukemia.
Fetoxicity and Teratogenicity
Cleft palate, agnathia, and micrognathia were associ-
ated with a single SC injection of 3 mL/kg to CF-1 mice
on day 13 of gestation (109). This study was considered
to be inadequate, however, because no controls were
used. Delayed ossification of sternebrae was observed in
the offspring of Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to air con-
taining 300 or 2200 ppm benzene for 6 hr/day on days 6
to 15 ofgestation (110). Significantly increased incidences
of missing sternebrae were observed in the female off-
spring after exposures of the mothers at 2200 ppm.
Delayed ossification was also found in the fetuses of
Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to air containing 50 or 500
ppm benzene, 7 hr/day on days 6 to 15 of gestation. The
mean number of caudals (vertebrae) in the fetuses ofthe
rats that were exposed was significantly less than that
in the fetuses of controls (111).
Skeletal retardation and abnormalities (but not malfor-
mations) were observed in the offspring of CFY rats ex-
posed to air containing 313 ppm benzene, 24 hr/day on
days 9 to 14 ofgestation (112). Fetal weight retardation,
resorptions, fetal deaths, and skeletal variants but no
skeletal malformations, were observed following inhala-
tion exposure of pregnant CFLP mice to 500 or 1000
mg/m3 (156 or 313 ppm) benzene on days 7 to 20 ofgesta-
tion; New Zealand rabbits showed maternal and fetal
weight reductions and abortions at 313 ppm, but not at
156 ppm (113). Coate et al. (114) reported fetal weight loss
in Sprague-Dawley rats at 100 ppm benzene but not at
1, 10, or 40 ppm. In CFY rats exposed to 125 ppm ben-
zene, maternal and fetal weights were reduced and skele-
tal variants were increased (115).
Keller et al. and Keller and Snyder (116,117)
documented alterations in fetal and offspring hematopoi-
esis following exposure ofpregnant Swiss-Webster mice
to 5, 10, or 20 ppm benzene during days 6 to 15 ofgesta-
tion. Ward et al. (118) reported that CD-1 mice exposed
to 300 ppm benzene for 13 weeks exhibited ovarian cysts,
testicular degeneration, atrophy, and decreased sper-
matozoa; animals exposed to 1, 10, or 30 ppm benzene
vapor showed no adverse effects.
No teratogenic effects were observed in offspring fol-
lowing 6-hr daily exposure ofpregnant Sprague-Dawley
rats to benzene vapor at 0, 10, 40, or 100 ppm on days 6
to 15 ofgestation (119). A slight fetotoxic effect (reduced
mean fetal body weights) was reported for both sexes of
offspring of the mothers that were exposed to benzene
at 100 ppm. The available data on teratologic studies have
been summarized (120,121). Schwetz (120) concluded that
benzene has not been found to be teratogenic in labora-
tory animals exposed during the critical period of devel-
opment of the embryo or fetus. After review of the ter-
atogenic studies, the author stated that exposure to
benzene at levels that do not cause other forms of toxic-
ity would not be expected to cause adverse development
effects. Davis (122) reviewed the literature on the
reproductive risks of benzene and concluded that more
animal and epidemiologic studies are needed before
definitive conclusions can be made.
Carcinogenesis Studies on Benzene
Metabolites
The many available long-term carcinogenicity studies
on benzene per se as conducted and reported by various
investigators are not specifically discussed or summa-
rized in our paper. These have been reviewed (123) and
evaluated (124). Further, Cronkite et al. (125) and Maltoni
et al. (126) report on their numerous studies as well as
record much ofthe carcinogenesis literature on benzene.
Rather, because several metabolites of benzene have
been studied in long-term carcinogenesis bioassays, we
recapitulate the available studies on phenol, catechol,
hydroquinone, and p-quinone in an attempt to give a
broader perspective to the results observed after ben-
zene exposure alone.
Phenol
Carcinogenesis studies of phenol (CAS No. 108-92-2)
were conducted by providing drinking water containing
0, 2500, or 5000 ppm to F344 rats and to B6C3F1 mice for
103 weeks (127,128). Increased incidences of three neo-
130
PANCARCINOGENESIS OF BENZENE
plasms were detected in low-dose male rats [leukemia,
18/50, 30/50 (p < 0.05), 25/50; pheochromocytoma of the
adrenal glands, 13/50, 22/50 (p < 0.05], 9/50; and C-cell
carcinoma ofthe thyroid gland, 0/50, 5/49 (p < 0.05), 1/50].
No chemical-related neoplasms were observed in female
rats or in male and female mice. Several investigators
have shown that phenol in acetone or in benzene pro-
motes skin cancer in mice pretreated with 7,12-dimethyl-
benz[a]anthracene (DMBA) or 3,4-benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)
(129-133). Phenol did not exhibit any cocarcinogenic ef-
fects when given with BaP (133,134).
Catechol
In 1951, Lehman et al. (135) reported a study in which
groups of 12 to 18 rats were exposed to 0.0625 to 1.0%
catechol (CAS No. 120-80-9) in the diet for 2 years. The
only response recorded was "beginning hepatic cell
hyperplasia" in the 0.25% group. In a short-term skin
tumor-promoting study, 30 female Sutter mice received
0.3 mL DMBA in benzene and, beginning 1 week later for
15 weeks, a single drop of 15% catechol in benzene. No
promoter activity was observed (130). Van Duuren and
Goldschmidt applied 150 Mg BaP topically to the dorsal
skin of 50 female Swiss mice and 14 days later applied 2
mg catechol in 0.1 mL acetone three times per week un-
til day 448 (133). No tumor-promoting activity was found.
Hecht et al. (136) applied 75 pg DMBA in 0.1 mL acetone
to groups of30 female Swiss mice one time only, followed
10 days later with 0.1 mL of a 1% catechol/acetone (1 mg
of catechol) solution five times per week for 67 weeks. In
these studies, catechol was inactive as a tumor promoter.
Van Duuren et al. (134) and Van Duuren and Goldschmidt
(133) applied 2 mg catechol with and without 5 jig BaP in
0.1 mL acetone to groups of 50 female Swiss mice three
times per week for 368 days. Of the mice dosed with
catechol and BaP in combination, 36 had skin papillomas
(2.5 per mouse) and 31 had skin squamous cell carcinomas.
In the group receiving only catechol, one mouse had a
skin papilloma and a squamous cell carcinoma. Thirteen
mice receiving BaP had skin papillomas (1.1 per mouse),
and 10 had squamous cell carcinomas. In these experi-
ments, catechol increased the carcinogenic activity of
BaP. Subsequently, Hecht et al. (137) tested a subfrac-
tion of cigarette smoke condensate containing 97%
catechol on groups of 30 female Swiss mice. A 0.25%
catechol-acetone solution (0.1 mL) alone or with 0.003%
BaP was applied five times per week for 52 weeks [this
dose was about one-sixth the dose used by Van Duuren
and Goldschmidt (133)]. The combination caused in-
creased incidences of neoplasms per mouse (1.4 versus
0.1) and greater percentages of mice with skin tumors
(73% versus 14%) and squamous cell carcinomas (64%
versus 11%). This study confirms that catechol possesses
cocarcinogenic effects. Boyland et al. (138) implanted
10-mg cholesterol pellets alone or containing 20% catechol
into the urinary bladders of mice. Of the 19 mice that
received the combination pellet and survived the 25-week
experiment, 1 (5.3%) had a papilloma and 3 (15.8%) had
carcinomas. Of77 mice with cholesterol pellets,4 (5%) had
adenomas or papillomas and 5 (6.5%) had carcinomas. A
marginal decrease (p. = 0.03) was observed for the
catechol group (4/19, 21.1% versus 9/77, 11.7%).
In an oral exposure study lasting 52 weeks, catechol
caused adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinomas of
the glandular stomach and hyperplasia ofthe forestomach
in F344 male rats (139). Hirose et al. (139) exposed groups
of 10 to 20 male rats to a) N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitroso-
guanidine (MNNG) alone (a single intragastric dose of 150
mg/kg body weight), b) MNNG followed 1 week later by
catechol in feed (1.5% in the diet for 4 weeks, then
reduced to 0.8% for 47 weeks due to lack of body weight
gain), c) catechol alone, and d) basal diet alone. The
histopathology findings are given in Table 1. These data
show that catechol tafter MNNG) strongly enhanced both
forestomach and glandular stomach carcinogenesis.
Catechol alone caused cancer in the pyloric region ofthe
glandular stomach. Thus catechol appears to be one ofthe
few environmental chemicals shown to cause cancer of
the glandular stomach.
Hydroquinone
Lehman et al. (135) fed hydroquinone (CAS No. 123-31-9)
at 0.125 to 2.0% in the diet to groups of 12 to 18 rats for
2 years. The authors reported a "suggestion" ofgastroin-
testinal ulceration and renal tumors in the 2% group.

0.5% or 0 to 1.0% (four concentrations) hydroquinone with
0.1% citric acid to groups of 10 to 23 male and female rats
for 103 weeks. No adverse hematologic or histopathologic
effects were recorded. Roe and Salaman (141) applied 0.3
mL ofa 6.7% hydroquinone-acetone solution (20 mg dose)
to the backs ofmale S-strain mice. Three weeks later cro-
ton oil (0.3 mL ofa 0.5% acetone solution) was applied der-
mally once a week for 18 weeks. One of the 22 survivors
had a skin papilloma. Hydroquinone was inactive as an
initiator of skin carcinogenesis.
Using experimental conditions similar to those
described above for catechol, Boutwell and Bosch (130)
and Van Duuren and Goldschmidt (133) reported that
hydroquinone had no promoter activity with DMBA or
BaP. Boyland et al. (138) tested hydroquinone as 20% in
10-mg cholesterol pellets implanted in the urinary blad-
der ofmice. Six ofthe 19 survivors (32%) at week 25 had
bladder carcinomas, whereas 4 benign and 5 malignant
neoplasms were found in 77 cholesterol controls (11.7%).
In this study, hydroquinone was considered carcinogenic.
In carcinogenesis studies, Van Duuren and Goldsch-
midt (133) applied hydroquinone in doses of5 mg with and
without 5 Mg BaP in acetone. Hydroquinone with BaP in-
duced fewer skin neoplasms than BaP alone (7 mice with
11 papillomas and 3 with squamous cell carcinomas versus
14 mice with 16 papillomas and 10 with squamous cell car-
cinomas).
Two-year carcinogenesis studies ofhydroquinone have
been conducted in male and female F344/N rats and
B6C3F1 mice (142). Hydroquinone was given in water by
gavage at doses of 0, 25, or 50 mg/kg for rats and 0, 50,
or 100 mg/kg for mice. Under the conditions ofthese ex-
periments, hydroquinone caused papillary hyperplasia of
the transitional epithelium, cysts, and tubular cell ade-
nomas (0/55 controls, 4/55 low dose, 8/55 top dose) ofthe
kidney in male rats; tubular cell hyperplasia was seen in
two additional high-dose rats. Pheochromocytomas ofthe
adrenal gland were somewhat increased (14/55, 19/48,
21/55), yet these lesions were not considered related to
chemical exposure. In female rats, mononuclear cell
leukemia was observed at higher incidences in exposed
groups (9/55, 15/55, 22/55). For mice, hydroquinone in-
duced neoplasms ofthe liver in female mice (mainly ade-
nomas: 2/55, 15/55, 12/55; also, carcinomas were observed
in 1 control, 2 low-dose, and 2 top-dose female mice), and
in both sexes follicular cell hyperplasia of the thyroid
gland was increased (male: 5/55, 15/53, 19/54; female:
13/55, 47/55, 45/55). In female mice a marginal increase in
follicular cell adenomas of the thyroid gland (3/55, 5/55,
6/55) was observed [the background incidence of these
tumors is 2.1% (41/1937) versus 5% in controls, 9% in low
dose, and 11% in top dose]. A follicular cell carcinoma of
the thyroid gland was found in another top dose female
mouse.
p-Quinone
Three carcinogenesis studies have been reported for
p-quinone (CAS No. 106-51-4) (143). In 1940, Takizawa
painted the skin of mice every 1 or 2 days for about 200
days with 0% (benzene only), 0.1%, or 0.25% p-
benzoquinone in benzene. Of 46 controls, 1 had a skin
papilloma and 2 had adenocarcinomas ofthe lung. Among
the 41 mice at 0.1%, 6 had skin papillomas, 2 had skin car-
cinomas, and 10 developed lung adenocarcinomas. In the
0.25% group (44 mice), 3 had skin papillomas, 1 had a skin
carcinoma and 5 had lung adenocarcinomas. In a series
ofthree inhalation experiments, Kishizawa (144-146) ex-
posed groups of 25 mice to air containing 0 or 5 mg p-
quinone, once per day, six times per week. The numbers
ofmice with neoplasms ofthe lung were not different be-
tween control and dosed groups. Umeda (147) conducted
studies in 24 rats by injecting 0.5 mL ofpropylene glycol
with p-quinone SC once per week for 394 days (concen-
trations were 1% from days 1 to 53, 0.2% from days 54
to 173, and 0.4% from days 173 to 394). Of 17 surviving
rats receiving 32 injections (81 mg p-quinone and 16.5 mL
propylene glycol), 2 developed injection-site fibrosar-
comas.
Akyl Benzenes
We have also evaluated in long-term carcinogenicity
studies the two simple alkylbenzenes: methyl benzene
(toluene) and dimethyl benzenes (mixed xylenes). The
mixed xylenes (composed of 9% 1,2-; 60% 1,3-; 14%
1,4-xylene; and 17% ethylbenzene) were given to F344
rats (0, 250, 500 mg/kg) and to B6C3F1 mice (0, 500, 1000
mg/kg) by oral intubation. No evidence of carcinogenic-
ity was found in male rats, female rats, male mice, or fe-
male mice exposed 5 days/week for 2 years (2,148). In the
toluene studies F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed
by inhalation (rats: 0, 600, 1200 ppm; mice: 0, 120, 600,
1200 ppm) 6.5 hr/day, 5 days/week, for 2 years (2,149). The
only interesting findings from this study are that tubu-
lar cell adenomas of the kidney were found in one low-
dose and in two top-dose male rats, and another low-dose
male rat had a renal transitional epithelial carcinoma; one
top-dose female rat had a renal tubular cell carcinoma.
These lesions were not supported by the occurrence of
tubular cell hyperplasia. None were observed in controls
or in male or female mice. Because the kidney is a target
organ (severity of nephropathy was increased), because
the structural analogues benzene and xylene did not
cause renal tumors and because the finding of these few
uncommon tumor types were possible signals for poten-
tial public health concern, we decided to evaluate in ex-
tra detail this putative neoplastic target organ in an at-
tempt to get closer to the true incidence ofthese lesions.
For each male rat an additional six tissue sections were
evaluated; thus for each group of60 rats, 360 sections (to-
tal of 1080 sections) were prepared and read. The results
of this supplementary study revealed nine microscopic
adenomas that were not discovered on routine
sectioning-five in controls and four in the low-dose
group. All 12 tubular cell neoplasms were benign. The
combined diagnoses allows the more confident conclusion
that toluene did not cause any increases in hyperplasia,
benign neoplasia, or malignant neoplasms of the kidney.
132
PANCARCINOGENESIS OF BENZENE
Likewise neither benzene nor xylene was associated with
kidney toxicity.
Effects on Humans
Humans are susceptible to benzene myelotoxicity as
shown by the high incidence of pancytopenia among
workers with significant exposure (150). The connection
between myelotoxicity and acute myelogenous leukemia
remains a subject of considerable discussion. Blood dis-
eases associated with benzene exposure include pan-
cytopenia (most frequently cited), leukopenia, bone mar-
row hypoplasia or aplasia, thrombocytopenia,
granulocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia (11,25,151-153).
Benzene, a myelotoxic chemical, causes pancytopenia and
eventual aplastic anemia in most animal species exposed.
Ever since Santesson in 1897 (154) and Selling in 1916
(14) recorded that benzene could cause aplastic anemia,
numerous supporting reports have been published
(11,124). The correlation of exposure levels to specific
hematologic toxicity has been well documented; however,
it is not possible to reliably predict effects produced at
specific exposure levels. Likewise, it has not been possi-
ble to establish with certainty the degree ofexposure be-
low which no adverse hematologic effects in humans
would occur.
Effects in humans from benzene exposure have been
well characterized and described in medical, toxicology,
and poisoning treatment manuals and texts. Although the
benzene-associated signs and symptoms in humans can-
not be related exactly or with critical accuracy, the bio-
logic events that occur in humans from increasing rela-
tively short-term exposure to benzene appear to follow
a pattern from effects on the hematopoietic system,
through narcosis, and death. Loss of consciousness, ir-
regular heartbeat, dizziness, headache, and nausea were
observed in workers exposed to benzene at concentra-
tions below 20,000 ppm (155). Reports that single ex-
posures at concentrations of20,000 ppm were fatal within
5 to 10 min have been made (156). Continued exposure of
workers to benzene has been associated with decreased
concentrations of circulating erythrocytes, leukocytes,
and thrombocytes (157). The incidence ofsister-chromatid
exchanges was not significantly increased in the lympho-
cytes of22 workers in Italy exposed to benzene at 0.2 to
12.4 ppm (mean exposure time, 11.4 years) in air as com-
pared with persons living in the same area of similar age
and smoking habits (158). The incidence of chromosome-
type aberrations was significantly greater among ex-
posed workers compared with controls.
Although a link between benzene exposure and hemato-
logic disorders was suggested 80 years ago, a connection
with leukemia was not clearly established at that time.
In early epidemiologic studies, workers were exposed to
other chemicals in addition to benzene (11,25,124,149,151).
An association between long-term exposure to benzene
and the occurrence of leukemia was suggested as early
as 1928 by Delore and Borgomano (159), who described
acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a worker exposed to ben-
zene for 5 years. IARC (11,124) gives a chronology ofpub-
lished literature. Goldstein (160) describes a number of
additional case reports. Most malignancies in which an as-
sociation with exposure to benzene has been reported
have been leukemias, particularly those of the my-
elogenous type. A critical issue in benzene risk assess-
ment seems to center on the interpretation of the shape
associated with the dose-response curve relating benzene
exposure to acute myelogenous leukemia and variants.
More than 100 occurrences ofleukemia in humans have
been associated with benzene exposure since 1928
(159,161). More recent epidemiologic studies of small co-
horts exposed to benzene have demonstrated a causal as-
sociation for leukemia (11,20,23,25,124,162-169). Rinsky
et al. (163) examined the updated mortality of a cohort
with occupational exposure to benzene and calculated a
cumulative benzene exposure index (parts per million x
years) for each cohort member. These authors found that
the standard mortality ratio (SMR) for leukemia was 328
and for multiple myeloma was 398. With stratification of
the cohort by cumulative exposure, the SMRs for leuke-
mia increased from 105 in workers with less than 40 ppm-
years of exposure to 314 in workers with 40 to 199 ppm-
years, to 1757 in those with from 200 to 399 ppm-years,
and to 4535 in those with 400 ppm-years or more. Most
of these studies are suimmarized in the December 1985
and September 1987 Federal Register notices on occupa-
tional exposure to benzene (23,25) and to a lesser degree
by Austin et al. (170), Goldstein (171), and IARC (124).
After evaluating the available published data IARC
(11,124) considered benzene to be a Group 1 carcinogen:
sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity to humans, and as
having sufficient evidence ofcarcinogenicity in laboratory
animals. More current data on humans are presented in
these proceedings by Aksoy (168) for a large cohort of
Istanbul shoe workers and by Yin et al. (169) for a large
cohort of factory workers in China; the latter authors
found that for males the standardized mortality ratios
were elevated for leukemia, lung cancer, liver cancer, and
stomach cancer. And for females an excess in leukemia
was observed among the exposed. Given the overwhelm-
ing and conclusive carcinogenicity findings in laboratory
animals (1,2,11,123-126,188,189), Huff (25) testified that
the consistency and magnitude of the responses in
animals at relatively low exposures led him to the obvi-
ous speculation that there would likely be other types of
cancers as well as leukemias that one would suspect to
occur in humans. Yin et al. (169) has unfortunately shown
this to be true.
Study Rationale
Benzene was studied for long-term effects in rodents
by the NTP Carcinogenesis Program because ofits large
production volume, because of epidemiologic evidence
that exposure ofhumans to benzene is associated with an
increased incidence ofleukemia, and because previous ex-
perimental studies for carcinogenicity in laboratory
animals were considered to be inconclusive or inadequate.
133
HUFF ET AL.
In the studies reported in this paper, benzene was given
by gavage in corn oil because the chemical was only
slightly soluble in water, because benzene was considered
too volatile to be administered by feed, and to make cer-
tain that the animals would be exposed to a sufficient and
accurately calculated amount of the chemical. In retro-
spect, the inhalation route may have been a more ap-
propriate mimic of the major route of human exposure.
Nonetheless there is no convincing evidence that the
oral route used in these and other experiments would be
other than applicable and relevant to humans.

Materials and Methods
Procurement and Characterization
of Benzene
Benzene was obtained from Burdick and Jackson
Laboratories (Muskegon, MI). Lot numbers AB223 and
AB490 were used for both the 17-week and 2-year
studies. A comparison of the two lots by gas chromatog-
raphy indicated both were similar. Thereafter, lot no.
AB223 was used as a reference to identify both lots.
Purity and identity analyses were conducted at Mid-
west Research Institute (Kansas City, MO). Results of
elemental analyses for carbon and hydrogen agreed with
the theoretical values. Four impurities with a total area
0.2% that of the major peak were detected by gas chro-
matography in one system. Five impurities with a total
area less than 0.90%o that ofthe major peak were detected
by a second gas chromatographic system. The infrared,
ultraviolet/visible, and nuclear magnetic resonance spec-
tra were consistent with those in the literature. Benzene
was stored in its original container at room temperature.
Results of periodic analyses of the bulk chemical by gas
chromatography and infrared spectroscopy indicated that
the chemical was stable throughout these studies. The
benzene used in these studies was greater than 99.7%
pure.
Preparation and Characterization of Dose
Mixtures
A weighed amount ofbenzene was mixed with the ap-
propriate amount ofMazola corn oil and mixed by inver-
sion. Benzene in corn oil was found to be stable at 25ยฐC
for at least 7 days (Table 2). Dose mixtures were routinely
used within 2 weeks ofpreparation. All benzene/corn oil
mixtures analyzed were within ยฑ 10% ofthe target con-
centrations (Table 3).
Seventeen-Week Studies
Seventeen-week studies were conducted to evaluate
the cumulative toxicity ofbenzene, to identify target or-
gans, and to determine the doses to be used in the 2-year
studies. Four-week-old F344/N rats and 6-week-old
B6C3F, mice of each sex were obtained from Charles
River Breeding Laboratories, observed for 15 days, and
then assigned to cages according to a table of random

numbers. Cages were then assigned to vehicle control
and dosed groups according to another table of random
numbers.
Groups of 10 rats and 10 mice of each sex were ad-
ministered 0, 25, 50, 100, or 400 mg/kg benzene in corn
oil by gavage, 5 days per week for 17 weeks. Groups of
15 rats and 15 mice ofeach sex were administered 0, 200,
or 600 mg/kg. Rats and mice were housed 5 per cage.
Feed and water were freely available. Animals were
checked twice daily; moribund animals were killed. Ani-
mal weights were recorded weekly.
Hematologic analyses were performed on blood taken
from the orbital sinuses offive rats and five mice of each
sex killed on day 0 and on day 60, of five rats and five
mice of each sex from the 0, 200, and 600 mg/kg groups.
At the end of the 120-day studies, survivors were killed
and hematologic analyses were performed on five animals
from each group. A necropsy was performed on all
animals.
Two-Year Studies
Study Design. Groups of 60 male rats were adminis-
tered 0, 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg benzene in corn oil by
gavage, 5 days/week for 103 weeks. Groups of60 female
rats and 60 mice ofeach sex were administered 0, 25, 50,

or 100 mg/kg. Blood was withdrawn from 10 randomly
preselected animals from each sex and dose group (nos.
41-50) at 12, 15, 18, and 21 months. Blood was also taken
from moribund animals before they were killed and from
all animals at the end of the experiment at 24 months.
Groups of 10 animals of each sex and species from both
control and exposed groups were removed at 51 weeks
at the doses of the 2-year studies; blood was withdrawn
at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and at 12 months these
animals were killed and necropsies were performed.
Hematologic Analyses. Hematologic analyses included
packed cell volume, red blood cell count, total and
differential white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and mean
corpuscular volume. Reticulocyte count and prothrombin
time (PRT) were also determined.
Source and Specifications ofAnimals. The male and
female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 (C57BL/6N, female, x
C3H/HeN MTV-, male) mice used in this study were
produced under strict barrier conditions at the Charles
River Breeding Laboratories (Portage, MI) under a con-
tract to the Carcinogenesis Program. Breeding stock for
the foundation colonies at the production facility origi-
nated at the National Institutes of Health Repository.
Animals shipped for study were progeny of defined
microflora-associated parents that were transferred from
isolators to barrier-maintained rooms. Animals were
shipped to the laboratory at 4 to 5 weeks of age. The
animals were quarantined at the facility for 2 weeks.
Thereafter, a complete necropsy was performed on five
animals ofeach sex and species to assess their health sta-
tus. The rats were placed on study at 7 to 8 weeks of age
and the mice at 6.5 to 8.5 weeks of age. The health ofthe
animals was monitored during the course ofthe study ac-
cording to the protocols ofthe NTP Sentinel Animal Pro-
gram.
A quality control skin grafting program has been in ef-
fect since early 1978 to monitor the genetic integrity of
the inbred mice used to produce the hybrid B6C3F1 ani-
mal. In mid-1981, data were obtained that showed incom-
patibility between the NIH C3H reference colony and the
C3H colony from a Program supplier. In August 1981, in-
bred parental lines of mice were further tested for
genetic integrity via isozyme and protein electrophore-
sis profiles that demonstrate phenotype expressions of
known genetic loci. The C57BL/6 mice were homogene-
ous at all loci tested. Eighty-five percent ofthe C3H mice
monitored were variant at one to three loci, indicating
some heterogeneity in the C3H line from this supplier.
Nevertheless, the genome ofthis line is more homogene-
ous than that of randomly bred stocks. Further, all
animals used in these studies were genetically identical.
Male mice from the C3H colony and female mice from the
C57BL/6 colony were used as parents for the hybrid
B6C3F1 mice used in these studies. The influence of the
potential genetic nonuniformity in the hybrid mice on
these results is not known, but results ofthe studies are
not affected because concurrent controls were included
in each study.
Animal Maintenance. Animals were housed five per
cage. Feed and water were freely available.
Clinical Examinations and Pathology. All animals
were observed twice per day, and clinical signs were re-
corded once per week. Body weights by cage were re-
corded once per week for the first 12 weeks of the study
and once every 4 weeks thereafter. Mean body weights
were calculated for each group. Moribund animals were
killed, as were animals that survived to the end of the
study. A necropsy was performed on all animals, includ-
ing those found dead.
Examinations for grossly visible lesions were per-
formed on major tissues or organs. Tissues were
preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded
in paraffin, sectioned, placed on slides, stained with
hematoxylin and eosin, and evaluated.
When the pathology examination was completed, the
slides, individual animal data records, and summary ta-
bles were sent to an independent quality assurance lab-
oratory. Individual animal records and tables were com-
pared for accuracy, slides and tissue counts were verified,
and histotechnique was evaluated. All tumor diagnoses,
all target tissues, and all tissues from a randomly selected
10% of the animals were evaluated by a quality assurance
pathologist. Slides of all target tissues and those about
which the original and quality assurance pathologists dis-
agreed were submitted to the Pathology Working Group
(PWG) made up of six pathologists for evaluation.
Representative coded slides selected by the Chairperson
were reviewed by PWG pathologists, who reached a con-
sensus and compared their findings with the original and
quality assurance diagnoses. When diagnostic differences
were found, the PWG sent the appropriate slides and
comments to the original pathologist for review. This
procedure has been described, in part, by Maronpot and
Boorman (172) and Boorman et al. (173). The final diag-
noses represent a consensus of study and quality assur-
ance pathologists and the NTP Pathology Working
Group. For subsequent evaluations, the diagnosed lesions
for each tissue type are combined according to the guide-
lines of McConnell et al. (174).
Statistical Methods
Survival Analysis. The probability of survival was es-
timated by the product-limit procedure of Kaplan and
Meier (175). Statistical analyses for a possible dose-
related effect on survival used the methods of Cox (176)
and Tarone (17?).
Calculation ofIncidence. The incidence of neoplastic
or nonneoplastic lesions is given as the ratio ofthe num-
ber ofanimals bearing such lesions at a specific anatomic
site to the number of animals in which that site was ex-
amined.
Analysis of Tumor Incidence. Three statistical
methods are used to analyze tumor incidence data. Tests
ofsignificance included pairwise comparisons ofhigh-dose
and low-dose groups with vehicle controls and tests for
overall dose-response trends. For studies in which com-
pound administration has little effect on survival, the
results ofthe three alternative analyses will generally be
similar. When differing results are obtained by the three
135
HUFF ET AL.
methods, the final interpretation ofthe data will depend
on the extent to which the tumor under consideration is
regarded as being the cause of death. All reported p-
values for tumor analyses are one-sided.
Life table analyses assume that all tumors of a given
type observed in animals dying before the end of the
study were fatal; i.e., they either directly or indirectly
caused the death of the animal. The underlying variable
considered by this analysis is time to death due to tumor.
If the tumor is rapidly lethal, then time to death due to
tumor closely approximates time to tumor onset.
Incidental tumor analyses assume that all tumors of a
given type observed in animals that died before the end
of the study were incidental, i.e., they were merely ob-
served at necropsy in animals dying of an unrelated
cause.
Primarily, the two survived-adjusted methods dis-
cussed are used to evaluate tumor incidence. The Fisher
exact test for pairwise comparisons and the Cochran-
Armitage linear trend test (178,179) are based on the
overall proportion of tumor-bearing animals and do not
adjust for survival differences. For details concerning the
statistical analysis oftumor incidence, see Haseman (180).
Hematology data were analyzed by a repeated mea-
sures analysis of variance (181). Pairwise comparisons
were made by the Dunnett multiple comparisons test
(182,183).
Results
Seventeen-Week Studies
No compound-related deaths occurred in rats. Final
mean body weights (relative to those of the vehicle con-
trols) were depressed 14 to 22% for male and female rats
that received 200, 400, or 600 mg/kg benzene.
A dose-related leukopenia was observed for both male
and female rats. Lymphoid depletion in the spleen was
observed in 3/5 male and 4/5 female rats that received 200
mg/kg benzene and 5/5 male and 5/5 female rats that
received 600 mg/kg benzene for 60 days and in 10/10 male
and 10/10 female rats that received 600 mg/kg for 120
days. Increased extramedullary hematopoiesis was ob-
served in the spleen of 4/5 male and 3/5 female rats that
received 600 mg/kg for 120 days. Based on these compos-
ite observations, doses selected for rats for the 2-year
studies were 0, 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg benzene in corn oil
for males and 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg for females.
No compound-related deaths occurred in mice. Final
mean body weights (relative to those of the vehicle con-
trols) were depressed 4 to 10% for all dosed groups that
received 100 mg/kg or more of benzene. Tremors were
observed intermittently in the 400 and 600 mg/kg groups
throughout the studies, and during the last 3 weeks ofthe
studies, tremors were more pronounced in male mice
than in females. A dose-related leukopenia was observed
for both male and female mice. No compound-related
histopathologic effects were observed. Based on these
findings, doses selected for mice for the 2-year studies
were 0, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg benzene in corn oil.
Two-Year Studies
Body Weights and Clinical Signs. Dose-related
weight gain reduction, with earlier and more pronounced
differences, occurred in male rats (Figs. 1 and 2). After
week 22, mean body weights of dosed male rats were
lower than those of the vehicle controls; the 200 mg/kg
group had body weights that were 11% lower than vehi-
cle controls at week 25 and that continued to be lower un-
til the difference was 23% at week 103. The low-dose
group was similar to vehicle controls throughout the
study; the mid-dose group showed about a 7 to 9% lower
body weight after 1 year. After week 62, mean body
weights of high-dose female rats were somewhat lower
than those of the vehicle controls. Only the top-dose
group showed reductions greater than 5% and the maxi-
mum difference (-9.5%) occurred at week 103.
Other than modest decreases in body weights in each
group compared with vehicle controls (except for the 200
mg/kg male rats), no extraordinary clinical signs were re-
corded. Nonspecific observations included a varying de-
gree of ocular discharge. This common syndrome in F344
rats was first observed at 4 to 5 months in both sexes and
across groups. A serous discharge varying from clear to
red-tinged or yellow and from scant to heavy occurred in
about 10% ofall rats; this may have been associated with
blood sampling techniques. Near the end of the studies,
a paleness of mucosa was recorded for rats in a moribund
state before death.
Mean body weights of mice were variable after week
45, and for high-dose male mice were lower than those of
the vehicle controls after week 47, ending in a difference
of - 19% at 103 weeks (Fig. 3). Mean body weights for
low- and mid-dose groups were like those of vehicle con-
trols until about the final 4 or 15 weeks ofthe study. Mean
body weights ofvehicle control and high-dose female mice
were comparable until week 87. From week 87 to the end
of the study, mean body weights of high-dose female mice
were lower than those of the vehicle controls; at week
103, the reduction was 15% (Fig. 4). No compound-related
clinical signs were observed.
Survival. Estimates of the probabilities ofthe survival
of male and female rats administered benzene at the
doses used in these studies and those of the vehicle con-
trols are shown in the Kaplan and Meier (175) curves in
Figures 5 and 6. The survival of the high-dose group of
male rats was significantly lower than that of the vehi-
cle control group after week 95 (Table 4). In females, the
survival of both the mid-dose group after week 101 and
high-dose groups after week 96 was significantly lower
than that of the vehicle control group; this latter group
had exceptionally good survival (92%) compared with the
historical rate of 74% + 7% (SD) (184)
Estimates of the probabilities of survival for male and
female mice administered benzene at the doses used in
these studies and for the vehicle controls are shown in the
Kaplan and Meier curves in Figures 7 and 8. The survival
of thq high-dose group of both male mice after week 96
and female mice after week 92 was significantly lower
than that ofthe respective vehicle control groups (Table
5).

Pathology and Statistical Analyses ofResults. This
section describes the statistically significant or biologi-
cally noteworthy changes in the incidence of rats and
mice with neoplastic or nonneoplastic lesions. For rats
these include Zymbal gland, palate, lip, tongue, skin,
uterus, uterus/endometrium, spleen, thymus, cardiac
stomach, adrenal gland, thyroid gland, and pituitary
gland. For mice these include Zymbal gland, preputial
gland, ovary, mammary gland, Harderian gland, lung,
hematopoietic system, stomach, liver, and adrenal gland.
RATS. Zymbal Gland. Hyperplasia or squamous
metaplasia ofthe Zymbal gland was increased in low-dose
male rats and in mid-dose and high-dose females (Table
6). The incidences of ductal dilatation in males (vehicle
control, 8/32; low dose, 35/46; mid dose, 20/42; high dose,
28/42) and in females (15/45; 22/40; 28/44; 23/46) were in-
creased as were those of cystic ducts (male: vehicle con-
trol, 1/32; low dose, 7/46; mid dose, 6/42; high dose, 0/42;
female: 1/45; 2/40; 8/44; 3/46). Carcinomas in males and fe-
males occurred with positive trends, and the incidences
in the mid-dose and high-dose males and dosed females
were greater than those in the vehicle controls (Table 6).
Grossly, these lesions appeared on the side of the head
adjacent to or involving the ear and were up to 6 cm in
diameter. The interior of the tumor was soft, yellow to
white, and occasionally gritty. Microscopically, the
tumors contained various amounts of epithelial and seba-
ceous elements and were classified as adenomas or car-
cinomas. Rarely, Zymbal gland neoplasms contained sig-
nificant spindle-cell components; these were classified as
carcinosarcomas, and one was found in a 50 mg/kg female
rat. Although they vary histologically, these tumors are
considered to be part of the spectrum of Zymbal gland
tumors. No lesions were observed in the 10 animals per
sex killed at 12 months.
Palate, Lip, and Tongue. The numbers of rats with
squamous cell neoplasms ofthe palate, lip, or tongue are
given in Table 7. Squamous cell papillomas, squamous cell
carcinomas, and squamous cell papillomas or carcinomas
(combined) of the palate, lip, or tongue (separately and
combined in males and combined in females) occurred
with positive trends (Table 8).
Neoplasms of the tongue appeared grossly as raised
papillary masses on the dorsal surface. These lesions
were well differentiated and contained primarily squa-
mous cells and were classified as either squamous cell
papillomas or squamous cell carcinomas depending on
whether invasion of adjacent structures had occurred.
Lesions ofthe lip had a similar microscopic appearance
to those neoplasms of the skin and others at the
mucocutaneous junction. Although separated topographi-
cally, these can be combined with skin tumors for biologic
interpretation.
Skin. Squamous cell papillomas, squamous cell carci-
nomas, and squamous cell papillomas or carcinomas (com-
bined) in male rats occurred with positive trends, and the
incidences in the high-dose group were greater than those
in the vehicle controls (Table 9).
Neoplasms of the skin were found on the face, back,
flank, and other locations. The lesions varied from 1 to 3
cm in diameter and were raised, ulcerated, and crusty,
often with a yellow, friable center. Microscopically, the
lesions varied from squamous cell papillomas and squa-
mous cell carcinomas to neoplasms containing various
amounts of adnexal structures. If sebaceous, basal, and
squamous elements were found, these lesions were clas-
sified as adenosquamous adenomas and carcinomas. A
few tumors formed primarily hair follicles (classified as
trichoepitheliomas), sebaceous elements (classified as se-
baceous adenomas), or craterlike epithelial tumors (clas-

Thyroid Gland. C-cell adenomas or carcinomas (com-
bined) in male rats occurred with a negative trend
(p = 0.039) and the incidences in the dosed groups were
not significantly different from that in the vehicle control
group (vehicle control, 9/49, 18%; low dose, 5/47, 11%; mid
dose, 4/46, 9%; high dose, 2/47, 4%). The incidences of C-
cell hyperplasia were 7/49 (14%) in the vehicle control,
12/47 (26%) in the low-dose, 7/46 (15%) in the mid-dose,
and 7/47 (15%) in the high-dose groups.
Pituitary Gland. Adenomas in male and female rats
and carcinomas in male rats occurred with negative
trends. The incidences in high-dose females and in mid-
dose and high-dose males were lower than those of the
vehicle controls. In male rats, the incidence of hyperpla-
sia was as follows: vehicle control, 3/47 (6%); low dose,
7/45 (16%); mid dose, 9/46 (20%); high dose, 5/48 (10%); the
incidence of adenomas or carcinomas (combined) was
18/47 (38%) in the vehicle control, 11/45 (24%) in the low-
dose, 11/46 (24%) in the mid-dose, and 7/48 (15%) in the
high-dose groups. In female rats, the incidence of hyper-
plasia was as follows: vehicle control, 5/47 (11%); low dose,
10/50 (20%); mid dose, 5/48 (10%); high dose, 7/49 (14%);
the incidence of adenomas was 22/47 (47%) in the vehicle
control, 15/50 (30%) in the low-dose, 15/48 (31%) in the
mid-dose, and 8/49 (16%) in the high dose groups.
MICE. Zymbal Gland. Epithelial hyperplasia was ob-
served at increased incidences in mid- and high-dose male
and high-dose female mice (Table 11). Squamous cell car-
cinomas in males and females occurred with positive
trends. The incidences in the mid- and high-dose males
and high-dose females were greater than those in the ve-
hicle controls. All neoplasms were carcinomas; no ade-
nomas were observed. Also, one high-dose male and one
high-dose female had a carcinosarcoma.
The incidences of Zymbal gland carcinomas were in-
creased in mid-dose and high-dose male mice and in high-
dose female mice. In mid-dose and high-dose male mice
and in high-dose female mice, the incidences of epithelial
hyperplasia of the Zymbal gland were also increased.
The possible early occurrence and progression ofthese
lesions was investigated by an examination of the Zym-
bal glands from the 10 animals per group killed after 12
months of exposure; no nonneoplastic or neoplastic patho-
logic effects were observed.
Preputial Gland. Hyperplasia was observed at in-
creased incidences in the preputial gland of low and mid-
dose male mice (Table 12). Squamous cell carcinomas and

carcinomas (all types) occurred in male mice with positive
trends. The incidences of squamous cell carcinomas in
mid- and high-dose males and the incidences of carci-
nomas (all types) in mid- and high-dose males were
greater than those of the vehicle controls. One low-dose
and one high-dose male had a carcinosarcoma. There
were no corresponding clitoral gland neoplasms in fe-
males. Epithelial hyperplasia was observed in six low-
dose, two mid-dose, and one high-dose female.
Ovary. The incidence offemale mice with various non-
neoplastic and neoplastic lesions in the ovary is given in
Table 13. Granulosa cell tumors and benign mixed tumors
occurred with positive trends. The incidences of
granulosa cell tumors in the high-dose group and benign
mixed tumors in the mid- and high-dose groups were
greater than those in the vehicle controls (Table 14). The
granulosa cell neoplasms consisted of well differentiated
granulosa cells arranged in tubular patterns, cell clusters
separated by interconnecting strands of stromal connec-
tive tissue, or homogeneous cell populations with no def-
inite cellular arrangement and scanty stroma. Benign
mixed tumors comprised heterogeneous cell types includ-
ing tubular structures arising from the ovarian surface
epithelium (germinal epithelium), stromal cells, and/or
granulosa cells exhibiting varying degrees of luteiniza-
tion. Luteomas consisted predominantly of luteinized
theca and/or granulosa cells and tubular adenomas con-
sisted ofrandomly arranged tubules with a low cuboidal
epithelium.
Mammary Gland. Carcinomas and carcinosarcomas in
female mice occurred with positive trends (Table 15). The

PANCARCINOGENESIS OF BENZENE
nomas often showed both an organoid pattern of
epithelial cell arrangement and extensive squamous
differentiation. Carcinosarcomas consisted of highly
anaplastic epithelial cells and a prominent spindle-cell
component resembling malignant fibroblasts.
Harderian Gland. Focal hyperplasia was observed at
increased incidences in dosed male and female mice (Ta-
ble 16). Adenomas in males and carcinomas in females oc-
curred with positive trends. The incidences of adenomas
in dosed male mice were greater than that in the vehicle
controls. The incidence ofcarcinomas in high-dose females
was marginally greater than that in vehicle controls.
These neoplasms consisted ofpseudoglandular structures
lined by epithelium showing loss of polarity, mild to
moderate pleomorphism, and formation of multiple
layers. The malignant tumors were less differentiated
and were locally invasive.
Harderian glands were examined from the 10 animals
per group killed at 12 months. Mild localized epithelial
hyperplasia was observed in 1/10 female vehicle controls,
1/10 low-dose males, and 1/10 mid-dose females; this lat-
ter mouse had a small adenoma near the hyperplastic fo-
cus. One of 10 low-dose females had a small focus ofnecro-
sis and acute inflammation.
Lung. The incidences ofalveolar epithelial hyperplasia
and alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms were increased in
dosed male and female mice (Table 17). Most of the sig-
nificant increases were due to carcinomas. For male mice,
the life table and incidental tumor tests give different
results regarding the statistical significance of dose-
response trends and ofincreased tumor incidences in the
mid- and high-dose groups. In this instance, the life table
test should be given the greater emphasis, since (a) the
increased incidence of lung tumors is due primarily to
malignant, potentially life-threatening tumors, (b) the in-
cidental tumor test has somewhat reduced sensitivity be-
cause of the excessive mortality in the high-dose group,
and (c) the unadjusted analyses indicate a significant in-
crease in tumor incidence, despite the reduced survival
in the high-dose group.
Hematopoietic System. Hematopoietic hyperplasia was
observed at increased incidences in the bone marrow of
dosed mice of each sex (Table 18). Splenic hematopoiesis
was also increased with dose (male: vehicle control, 5/49;
low dose, 9/48; mid dose; 19/49, high dose, 24/47; female:
9/49; 10/45; 6/50; 14/49). The few neoplasms diagnosed as
leukemia (2 in males, 5 in females) were considered to be
malignant lymphomas with associated "leukemia" (i.e.,
evidence of elevated lymphocytes/lymphoblasts in
peripheral blood). Thus, the lymphoma or leukemia data
(Table 18) should be viewed as all lymphoma for evalua-
tion purposes. Malignant lymphomas in male and female
mice occurred with positive trends. The incidences of
malignant lymphomas in all dosed groups ofmales and fe-
males were greater than those in the vehicle controls by
the life table test, which is generally regarded as the
more appropriate method of statistical analysis for these
potentially life-threatening neoplasms.
Forestomach. Epithelial hyperplasia and hyperkerato-
sis were observed at'increased incidences in low-dose
males and mid-dose and high-dose females (Table 19).
Squamous cell papillomas in male mice occurred with a
marginal positive trend (p = 0.048). The combined inci-
dence of male mice,with either squamous cell papillomas
or carcinomas, however, did not occur with a positive
trend (p = 0.07) by the incidental tumor test even though

the number of neoplasms in vehicle controls remained the
same (2/45) and the number in the dosed groups increased
(from 8/124 to 10/124). The increased incidences of squa-
mous cell papillomas and squamous cell papillomas or car-
cinomas (combined) in high-dose male mice were not
statistically increased. The increased incidences of squa-
mous cell papillomas in dosed females were also not
statistically increased; no squamous cell carcinomas were
observed. However, these neoplasms occur only rarely
in control mice (< 1%).
Liver. In female mice, the incidences ofhepatocellular
adenomas in the low-dose group and hepatocellular ade-
nomas or carcinomas (combined) in the low- and mid-dose
groups were greater than those in the vehicle controls
(Table 20).
Adrenal Gland. The incidences of hyperplasia in the
adrenal capsule in dosed mice of each sex (except high-
dose males) were greater than those in the vehicle con-
trols (Table 21). The incidence ofpheochromocytomas in
mid-dose male mice was greater than that in the vehicle
controls. In female mice, pheochromocytomas or malig-
nant pheochromocytomas (combined) occurred with a
negative trend, and the incidences in the dosed groups
were lower than that in the vehicle controls.
Hematologic Analyses. Hematologic effects were lim-
ited to lymphocytopenia (data not shown). The analyses
of variance indicate strong dose effects that varied across
time for both male and female rats. For males, the data
suggest a compound-related reduction in lymphocyte
count in months 3 through 21. The significance of the in-
teraction term in the analysis of variance for months 12
through 21 is reflected in temporal changes in the mag-
nitude of differences between vehicle control and dosed
groups. Overall, the pattern ofresponse, without regard
for magnitude of differences, is consistent across time,
suggesting a compound-related depression of lympho-

cytes in males. There is also evidence of a similar dose-
related effect on lymphocytes in females. As in males,
differences between dosed and vehicle control means oc-
curred in months 3 through 21. However, that pattern of
response is not as consistent or dramatic as that seen in
the data for males.
Hematologic effects in mice were limited to lympho-
cytopenia as well. For both males and females, the ana-
lyses ofvariance suggest strong, temporally variable dose
effects in the second year of the studies. Significant dose
effects are also evident from males in the first year. The
temporal variation in dose response in males appears to
be mainly the result of time-oriented changes in the mag-
nitude of difference between vehicle control and dosed
groups. However, with the exception ofmonth 12, there
is consistent evidence of compound-related depression in
lymphocytes in months 3 through 21, suggesting a com-
pound effect in males. A higher degree oftemporal varia-
bility in pattern of response makes a similar effect in fe-
males questionable.
The NTP found that benzene administered by gavage
induced micronuclei in male and female B6C3F1 mice;
males were more sensitive than females (97).
A complete statistical analysis of all hematology data
is available from the National Toxicology Program. How-
ever, the technical quality of certain of these data was
considered questionable; thus, more detailed analyses
(e.g., investigation of the association between hemato-
logic and pathologic changes) are deemed inappropriate
for these data.

Discussion
Design
Two-year toxicology and carcinogenicity studies of ben-
zene (99.7% pure) were conducted on groups of 50 F344/N
rats and 50 B6C3Fj mice of each sex. Doses of0, 50, 100,
or 200 mg/kg benzene were administered to male rats by
gavage in corn oil, 5 days per week for 103 weeks. Doses
of 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg were administered to female
rats and mice ofeach sex on the same schedule. Doses for
the 2-year studies were selected after evaluation of
17-week studies in which groups of 10 or 15 rats and 10
or 15 mice of each sex were administered 0, 25, 50, 100,
200, 400, or 600 mg/kg. The only clinical signs recorded
for these 4-month studies were lowered body weights and
ocular discharge in rats and tremors in mice in the higher
dosed groups; some lymphoid depletion was observed in
rats and leukopenia in mice. An additional 10 animals per
group were started along with the 2-year animals; these
were killed at 1 year. No biologically important toxic or
carcinogenic lesions were observed, except possibly for
the Harderian gland.
Body Weights and Survival
Mean body weights of some groups of dosed rats and
mice were lower than those of the vehicle controls, and
survival of some dosed groups was significantly lower
than that of the corresponding vehicle controls. For male
rats, the mean body weights after week 22 decreased
with dose. The mean body weights ofthe high-dose male
rats were notably lower than those of the vehicle con-
trols, and mean body weights ofmid- and high-dose male
rats were slightly lower than those ofthe vehicle controls
(Fig. 1). Mean body weights ofhigh-dose female rats were
slightly lower than those of the vehicle controls after
week 62 (Fig. 2).
Survival decreased with increasing dose for both male
and female rats (Tables 4 and 22, Figs. 5,6). Survival of
the high-dose male rats and of the mid- and high-dose fe-
male rats was lower than that ofthe vehicle controls; sur-
vival in all groups of rats, except high-dose male rats, was
50% or more at 104 weeks. The reduced survival ob-
served for the high-dose group of male rats (16/50, 32%)
reflects to some degree a likely toxic response from the
200 mg/kg dose regimen, double the high dose used for
the female rats and male and female mice (100 mg/kg). A
partial reason for the apparent decrease in survival in
dosed female rats is the greater-than-average survival
seen for the vehicle controls (46/50, 92%). Although the
survival of high-dose females was comparatively low
(25/50, 50%), the numbers of animals alive at the end of
the study for the low-dose (38/50, 76%) and the mid-dose
(34/50, 68%) groups are considered to be good (184,185).
In any event, survival at week 92 of all groups was 60%
or more. Most rats that died early had neoplasia.
Mean body weights ofmid- and high-dose male mice and
high-dose female mice were lower than those of the ve-
hicle controls (Figs. 3,4). Survival of high-dose male and
female mice was lower than that of the vehicle controls
(Tables 5 and 22, Figs. 7,8). The lower survival of the
dosed groups of mice may have been a consequence of the
increased incidences of life-threatening lymphomas and
alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas in the dosed groups
rather than a singular toxic effect of benzene. At week
92, for instance, survival of all groups of mice was above
60%.
Hematology
Epidemiologic studies have shown that exposure of
workers to benzene is associated with increased risk of
aplastic anemia and of leukemia (11,23,25,151-153,
161-169). Benzene-associated leukopenia has been
reported in mice, rats, and humans.
Benzene affected the hematopoietic system of F344/N
rats and B6C3F1 mice in the current 17-week studies;
dose-related leukopenia, predominantly a lymphocytope-
nia, was observed for rats and mice of each sex, and
compound-related lymphoid depletion and increased ex-
tramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen were observed
in rats of each sex.
For the 2-year studies, leukopenia was observed in
dosed male rats during the early part of the study, and
values returned to near control levels at the 21-month col-
lection. In dosed female rats, leukopenia was evident be-
tween months 3 and 12. In male vehicle control mice, the
white blood cell counts were greater than expected at the
6- and 9-month collections and could give an inaccurate

impression ofthe compound-related leukopenia; similarly,
high vehicle control group values for males were noted
at 18 and 21 months. In dosed female mice, benzene-
related leukopenia was observed at 12 and 18 months and
lends support to the possibility that the decreases seen
in the male mice might have been associated with ben-
zene administration as well.
A dose-related lymphocytopenia was evident in male
rats from 3 to 21 months. A similar, yet lesser effect was
seen in female rats. For male mice, a decrease in lympho-
cytes was seen at the 3- through 9-month interval and
during the 12- through 21-month period. The lym-
phocytopenia was evident for female mice between 12
and 18 months. Thus, exposure of rats and mice to ben-
zene in these studies produced a mild to moderate leu-
kocytopenia/lymphocytopenia. How this effect influences
the other observed toxic and pathologic responses re-
mains unknown.
Pathology
Increased incidences of neoplasms were observed at
multiple sites for male rats, female rats, male mice, and
female mice (Tables 23-26). Compound-related effects on
the hematopoietic system, Zymbal gland, forestomach,
and adrenal glands were found for both rats and mice.

The oral cavity was affected in rats only; and the lung,

mary gland were affected in mice only.
Hematopoietic System. As was seen in the 17-week
studies, lymphoid depletion of the spleen was observed
at increased incidences in dosed male and female rats (see
Table 23); lymphoid depletion of the thymus was seen in
dosed male rats. Bone marrow hematopoietic hyperpla-
sia was observed at increased incidences in dosed mice
of each sex.
The incidences of malignant lymphomas in all dose
groups ofmice were greater than those ofthe vehicle con-
trols. Benzene-associated neoplastic effects on the
hematopoietic system were not observed in male or fe-
male rats. The incidences of mononuclear leukemia in
dosed male rats were not different among dosed and ve-
hicle control groups. In high-dose female rats, the inci-
dence of mononuclear cell leukemia (9/50) was somewhat
greater than that in the vehicle controls (6/50); this in-
crease was significant by the life table test. These inci-
dences are in the range observed in vehicle control female
F344/N rats at the same laboratory (8/50-13/50) and
therefore are not considered to be clearly related to ad-
ministration ofbenzene. Further, the rates in concurrent
vehicle controls are somewhat low compared with histor-
ical rates. Hydroquinohe given by gavage in water at
doses of 50 or 100 mg/kg body weight caused leukemia in
female F344 rats (142). Phenol, the primary metabolite
of benzene, increased the incidence of mononuclear cell
leukemia in male F344/N rats that received 2500 ppm
phenol in drinking water for 2 years, but this increase
was not seen in male F344/N rats that received 5000 ppm
(vehicle control, 18/50, 36%; low dose, 30/50, 60%; p <
0.02; high dose, 25/50, 50%) (127,128).
Zymbal Gland. Groups of modified sebaceous glands
are located in the region of the external auditory canal
in rats and mice and were originally described in 1933 by
W. Zymbal and by C. Zawisch-Ossenitz apparently in-
dependently (186). Some see a correspondence between
the sebaceous Zymbal gland and the modified sebaceous
ceruminous gland in humans (glands in the skin ofthe ex-
ternal auditory canal that secrete the watery component
ofthe cerumen); others consider this relation as tenuous.
Yet Pliss (186) wrote that tumors of the auditory seba-
ceous glands in rats (and mice) are similar to tumors of
the sebaceous glands in humans. Tumors of the auditory
sebaceous (Zymbal) glands are uncommon (less than 1%)
in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice (184). These neoplasms
usually arise at the base ofthe ear, often invading the ear
canal, and have both sebaceous and squamous differen-
tiation. Pohl and Fouts (187) found cytochrome
P-450-dependent enzyme activity in homogenates of Zym-
bal glands from P-naphthoflavone-treated rats and mice.
These authors suggested that chemical carcinogens can
be metabolized to their initiating products in this gland.
The incidences of Zymbal gland carcinomas in the two
upper dose groups of male rats and in all dose groups of
female rats were greater than those in the vehicle con-
trols (Tables 23-25) and exceeded the greatest incidences
observed in corn oil vehicle historical controls. Epithelial
152
PANCARCINOGENESIS OF BENZENE
hyperplasia and carcinomas ofthe Zymbal gland were in-
creased in mid- and high-dose male mice and in high-dose
female mice. Because the Zymbal gland had been
reported as a possible target organ (188), Zymbal glands
from 10 animals per group were examined after 12
months ofexposure; no nonneoplastic or neoplastic effects
were observed.
Maltoni and Scarnato (188) first reported Zymbal gland
tumors in female (but not male) Sprague-Dawley rats ex-
posed to benzene at 50 mg/kg (two tumors in 30 rats) and
250 mg/kg (5/32); control rats in this colony reportedly had
a background incidence of 0.9% (189). In later inhalation
experiments, Maltoni et al. (189) reported increases in
Zymbal gland carcinomas; incidences in Sprague-Dawley
rats appear to be: male-control, 0.6%; 200 ppm, 1.4%; 300
ppm, 5.3%; female~-control, 1.7%; 200 ppm, 1.7%; 300
ppm, 5.6%. Results from both inhalation and oral studies
of Maltoni confirm the carcinogenic response of the Zym-
bal gland to benzene. Composite data from these studies
are given in these proceedings (126).
Skin. Benzene was associated with neoplasms of the
oral cavity and skin of rats but not ofmice (Tables 23-25).
The incidences of squamous cell papillomas and squamous
cell carcinomas of the skin in high-dose male rats were
greater than those observed in the concurrent or histor-
ical vehicle controls.
These neoplasms of the skin and oral cavity in rats ex-
posed to benzene are unusual in that both adnexal and
squamous elements are present. Even though these
adenosquamous lesions contain sebaceous elements, they
are distinct from the background sebaceous adenomas
sometimes observed and appear to represent a benign
form of an unusual benzene-related skin neoplasm. The
skin neoplasms were considered to be a systemic effect
ofbenzene metabolites, although the skin could have been
topically exposed by the rats' grooming or by their ex-
haling unchanged benzene or its metabolites. Because
benzene has been shown conclusively in numerous experi-
ments not to induce skin tumors when applied topically,
these skin lesions probably resulted from systemic ex-
posure from reactive intermediates or from excretion of
metabolites in saliva and then grooming. A less likely, yet
possible, explanation for the oral lesions would be that in-
termediates are excreted by skin and thus the animals
are exposed orally when they lick the skin. The uncom-
mon squamous cell papillomas and squamous cell carci-
nomas of the oral cavity (including the palate, lip, and
tongue) of dosed rats of each sex were probably due to
a systemic effect of benzene-reactive intermediates.
Squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity were also
reported for Sprague-Dawley rats administered 500
mg/kg benzene by gavage for 104 weeks (189).
Lung. Administration ofbenzene was associated with
alveolar epithelial hyperplasia in male and female mice,
alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas in male mice, alveo-
lar/bronchiolar adenomas and alveolar/bronchiolar carci-
nomas in female mice (Tables 23, 24, and 26). The in-
creased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms
most likely result from a systemic effect of benzene
rather than from a topical effect as a result of exhalation
of unchanged benzene. Regardless of the route of ex-
posure, benzene is apparently eliminated both in the ex-
pired air and in the urine (28-31). For instance, 40% of a
single oral dose of benzene was reported to be exhaled
unchanged from the lungs ofrabbits (190); 70% ofthe ben-
zene given SC to mice was found in expired air (191).
Harderian Gland. First described by J. Harder in the
1600s, Harderian glands are self-secreting accessory lac-
rimal glands at the inner corner of the eye in vertebrates
that have well-developed nictitating membranes; these
excrete an unctuous fluid that facilitates the movement
of the third eyelid. These glands are rudimentary in hu-
mans (192). The Harderian gland is racemose and horse-
shoe shaped and lies deep within the orbit. The smaller
arm lies superior to the larger arm, and these arms are
connected by a narrow band. A single excretory duct
opens at the base of the nictitating membrane (193). The
color of the gland varies from pink to dark grey. The
gland is thought to produce and excrete porphyrin.
Focal hyperplasia of the Harderian gland was observed
at increased incidences in dosed mice of each sex (Table
23). The incidences ofHarderian gland adenomas and ade-
nomas or carcinomas (combined) in dosed male and in
high-dose female mice were greater than those in the ve-
hicle controls (Table 26). The incidences in the mid- and
high-dose female mice were greater than those previously
observed in corn oil vehicle controls (10/50 and 10/47 vs.
2/50); the incidence in the concurrent controls (5/48) is also
greater than that previously observed.
Harderian glands were examined from the 10 animals
per group killed at 12 months. Mild localized epithelial
hyperplasia was observed in one female vehicle control,
one low-dose male, and one mid-dose female; the mid-dose
female had a small adenoma near the hyperplastic focus.
One low-dose female had a small focus of necrosis and
acute inflammation. One mid-dose male had a small ade-
noma.
Preputial Gland. Administration of benzene to male
mice was associated with hyperplasia and squamous cell
carcinomas ofthe preputial gland (Tables 23 and 26). The
incidences of squamous cell caroinomas in the mid-dose
(19/50) and high-dose (31/49) groups greatly exceed the
overall historical incidence (1/1090). A possible explana-
tion for this effect could be similar to that for the
systemic-mediated skin and oral cavity lesions seen in
rats. However, the potential effects ofbenzene exposure
by grooming cannot be fully discounted. No increases
were observed for this lesion in male rats. Likewise, no
increase in neoplasia was observed in the clitoral gland
of female mice or rats (histogenetically related to the
preputial gland).
Ovary. Various uncommon nonneoplastic lesions and
neoplastic lesions of the ovary (papillary cystadenoma, lu-
teoma, granulosa cell tumors, tubular adenomas, benign
mixed tumors, epithelial hyperplasia, and senile atrophy)
were observed in benzene-exposed female mice (Tables
13,14, 23, and 26). The incidences ofgranulosa cell tumors
in the high-dose group and benign mixed tumors in mid-
and high-dose groups offemale mice were increased com-
pared with those in the vehicle controls. Benign mixed
153
HUFF ET AL.
tumors and tubular adenomas ofthe ovary have not been
reported previously in 1028 corn oil vehicle female con-
trol mice, whereas the historical incidence of granulosa
cell tumors or carcinomas is 3/1028 as compared with 8/48
in the present study.
Mammary Gland. Incidences of carcinomas of the
mammary gland in mid-dose and high-dose female mice
and carcinosarcomas in high-dose female mice were in-
creased (Tables 23 and 26). No comparable effects were
seen in male mice or in male and female rats. Similarly,
no increases in any nonneoplastic lesion ofthe mammary
gland were seen in any group.
Forestomach. Hyperkeratosis and acanthosis in the
nonglandular stomach were increased in high-dose male
rats (Table 23). The incidences of hyperkeratosis in low-
dose male mice and mid- and high-dose female mice were
greater than those in the vehicle controls. Although the
incidences of squamous cell papillomas in high-dose mice
ofeach sex were not statistically greater than those in the
vehicle controls, the incidences of these uncommon ne-
oplasms in mice are noticeably greater than those ob-
served in corn oil vehicle historical controls. No irritation
response and no neoplastic effects were observed in rats.
Thus, the increased incidences of squamous cell papil-
lomas of the forestomach in mice were likely related to
the administration of benzene (Table 26).
In a 1-year study, catechol given in the diet to male
F344 rats at a concentration of0.8% caused hyperplasias,
adenomas, and adenocarcinomas of the glandular stom-
ach and hyperplasia of the forestomach. After MNNG,
catechol greatly enhanced both the forestomach and glan-
dular stomach carcinogenesis. Mice were not studied
(139).
Adrenal Gland. Focal hyperplasia of the zona fas-
ciculata of the adrenal gland was observed at increased
incidences in low-dose rats ofeach sex (Table 23). Hyper-
plasia of the adrenal capsule occurred at increased inci-
dences in dosed mice of each sex. The incidence of
pheochromocytomas in mid-dose male mice was greater
than that in the vehicle concurrent and historical controls.
In contrast, in dosed female mice, the incidence of
pheochromocytomas was lower than that in the vehicle
controls.
Liver. Heptocellular adenomas in low-dose female mice
and hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas (combined) in
low- and mid-dose female mice were increased in compar-
ison to those in the vehicle controls (Tables 23 and 26).
These incidences were greater than those previously ob-
served in corn oil vehicle controls. In male mice, the num-
ber of hepatocellular carcinomas in the mid-dose group
was marginally higher than that in the vehicle controls
by the life table test (9/49 versus 17/50) but was not
statistically increased by the appropriate adjusted anal-
ysis (incidental tumor test). Kari (142) found similar gen-
der differences in that hydroquinone caused liver ne-
oplasms in female mice but no increases were observed
for male mice. Maltoni et al. (126,189) reported that
hepatocellular carcinomas were associated with inhala-
tion exposure of Sprague-Dawfey rats to benzene at 200
to 300 ppm for 4 to 7 hr/day for up to 104 weeks. In the
current studies, the incidences of liver cell proliferative
lesions were similar among dosed and vehicle control
groups of F344/N rats; a slight increase was observed for
clear cell changes in mid-dose male rats.
Summary
Carcinogenicity. Most of the increased incidences of
neoplasia were quite evident, and the statistical sig-
nificance did not depend on which test procedure was
used. However, for other lesions, the findings were con-
sidered marginal. For example, certain neoplasms gener-
ally regarded as nonlethal showed significant increases
by life table analysis but not by the more appropriate in-
cidental tumor test; these neoplasms included squamous
cell papillomas of the forestomach in male and female
mice. Nonetheless, these neoplasms are relatively uncom-
mon in B6C3F, mice (< 1%) and are probably associated
with benzene administration; further, in both concurrent
vehicle control groups, the incidences were male, 2/45; fe-
male, 1/42. In addition, some tumors showed apparent in-
creases at lower doses which were not supported by simi-
lar high dose effects: hepatocellular adenomas or
carcinomas in female mice and pheochromocytomas ofthe
adrenal gland in male mice. Biologically, these might be
considered as being posMbly related to benzene exposure,
given that the survival in the high-dose groups was uni-
formly lower than that in vehicle controls, and hence per-
haps these groups could have had reduced sensitivity for
exhibiting a carcinogenic response. Most ofthese animals
died with either lung tumors or malignant lymphoma or
both, and these competing risks could have reduced the
likelihood of observing these late-appearing liver tumors.
Also, pharmacokinetically, saturation ofactivation/deacti-
vation systems do not allow consistent prediction as to
which pathway will prevail. In any event, these tumors
were considered not to be clearly due to benzene ex-
posure.
The variety and multiplicity of toxic/carcinogenic
responses to benzene exposure observed in these rodent
studies raise the question ofwhy the earlier 10 to 15 ex-
periments [6 dermal, 4 inhalation, 4 injection (11)] failed
to detect benzene-induced carcinogenicity. At least two
possible explanations exit. Most of the earlier reported
studies were less than adequate in comparison to current
protocols and designs; deflciencies included, for example,
too few animals, no control animals, short-duration, low-
level exposures, and so on. In addition, because it was
known that benzene caused hematotoxicity in rodents
and humans (including leukemia), a number of long-term
studies by design did not include or report complete
pathologic results; the possible implication is that major
or singular emphasis was placed on the hematopoietic
system and lesser consideration was given to other or-
gans or systems, thus accounting for the apparent lack
of carcinogenic responses (or sensitivity) from rodents ex-
posed to benzene.
More recent studies have been reported that collec-
tively accumulate evidence that benzene is indeed car-
cinogenic to laboratory animals and, in particular, to rats
154
PANCARCINOGENESIS OF BENZENE
and mice. Individually, most ofthese studies tend to pro-
vide marginal or speculative evidence. Together with our
data and the other relatively recent studies (125,126), the
evidence for benzene carcinogenicity in animals is now
unequivocal, convincing, and overwhelming: multiple site,
multiple strain, and multiple species carcinogen.
Metabolism or Metabolites
Metabolism probably occurs most rapidly in the liver,
where benzene is converted to benzene oxide, rearranges
to form phenol, reacts with glutathione to form a premer-
capturic acid, or is hydrated to the dihydrodiol and then
oxidized to catechol (Fig. 9). Hydroquinone is also formed
from phenol. Various benzoquinones are formed from the
two dihydroxy metabolites. A lesser pathway proposed
by Parke and Williams (190) includes ring opening to
muconaldehyde and muconic acid (28,30,194). Goldstein et
al. offer the possibility of "ring expansion" to "benzene
oxide-oxepin" (195). Considering that benzene apparently
lacks direct-acting clastogenicity or carcinogenicity, to-
gether with the presence ofcarcinogenic responses ofthe
metabolites studied so far (see "Introduction"), one could
speculate with confldence that benzene metabolic deriva-
tives possess or contribute to all the observed
toxic/carcinogenic properties.
As early as 1949, Porteous and Williams (196) argued
that the toxic effects ofbenzene are related to its metabo-
lites, and the authors separated these into toxic (free
phenols) and nontoxic (conjugates) phases. Since then, a
number of studies have been published by Williams and
co-workers on benzene and other chemicals (196). In ad-
dition, the bone marrow has been shown to convert ben-
zene to its known metabolites (197,198). Irons et al.
"clearly establish the capability of bone marrow to
metabolize benzene independent of metabolism of the
compound by the liver" (198). The authors stress, how-
ever, that recovered metabolites represented consider-
ably less than 1% of the benzene administered to male
F344/N rats. Certain benzene intermediates or combina-
tions thereof surely represent the toxic moiety or (com-
posite) of benzene.
Nonetheless, evidence exists that metabolic production
of reactive intermediates is required for expressing
benzene-induced toxicity and probably carcinogenicity as
well. As yet, the "active" chemical or chemicals have not
been identified conclusively. Two putative toxic metabo-
lites (benzoquinone and muconaldehyde) have attracted
the most attention. Further metabolism studies in which
the doses administered are the same as those used in
these current studies do permit better determination of
altered metabolism-types and amounts of metabolites
and pathways. The speculation that intermediates (or a
cumulative metabolic effect) cause the observed benzene-
associated toxicities remains to be further elucidated.
NIEHS has already made some interesting contribu-
tions to better understanding the multiplicative variables
that influence the metabolism of benzene under various
experimental conditions (routes of exposure and dosage
regimens) using several species (29-32).
Genetic Toxicology
Rickert et al. showed that after rats were exposed to
benzene, catechol, and hydroquinone were retained in the
bone marrow at higher concentrations and for longer
times than phenol (199). Catechol and hydroquinone (or
their metabolites) can be concentrated in bone marrow
and lymphoid organs (200), and reports suggest that the
toxicity of benzene may be related to the concentration
of catechol and hydroquinone in bone marrow (26).
The unique metabolism ofbenzene complicates studies
performed in vitro. In addition, benzene is so volatile that
one study showed that 90% ofa 250-ppm solution was lost
to the head space after 1 hr at 24ยฐC; however, benzene
did not appear to react with the culture medium with or
without fetal calf serum (201).
Although catechol and hydroquinone can induce SCEs
in human lymphocytes in vitro, benzene induced SCEs
in vitro only after metabolic activation (83,84). In addi-
tion, Tice et al. (102) and Erexson et al. (85) have shown
that benzene required metabolic transformation in order
to induce SCEs. Erexson et al. (85) observed the follow-
ing ranking ofbenzene and its metabolites for induction
of SCEs in human lymphocytes in vitro: catechol >
1,4-benzoquinone > hydroquinone > 1,2,4-benzenetriol
> benzene. Hydroquinone induced SCEs in CHO cells
and in cultured human lymphocytes (82,84). In addition,
hydroquinone also induced micronuclei in mice in vivo
(92,98,202,203). As expected for a clastogen, hydroqui-
none was not mutagenic in Salmonella (38,202,204).
Catechol induced SCEs in cultured human lymphocytes
(82,84), and chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells (205).
Tunek et al. found that catechol failed to induce
micronuclei in mice in vivo (92). Benzene and catechol in-
duced DNA strand breaks in mouse lymphoma L5178Y
cells (206). Consistent with the clastogenic activities of
benzene and its metabolites in mammalian cells is the
finding by Crebelli et al. that hydroquinone > catechol
> phenol in producing chromosomal aberrations in the
fungus Aspergillus nidulans (207), and free radicals ap-
peared to be implicated in the clastogenic mechanisms of
these metabolites.
Because human lymphocytes have mixed-function oxi-
dases and can metabolize many phenolic compounds
(208,209) and because benzene can be metabolized to
these phenolic derivatives in bone marrow in situ, Tunek
et al. (210) and Morimoto et al. (84) have suggested that
compounds formed by further metabolism of catechol and
hydroquinone might be responsible for the biological ef-
fects ofbenzene. These authors did not mention benzene
oxide or other potential metabolic intermediates formed
before the phenolic stage. Harper and Legator (99) have
provided indirect evidence that benzene is activated in
part by a cytochrome P-450 isozyme that is different from
those that activate benzo[a]pyrene or cyclophosphamide.
Morimoto et al. (84) observed that rat liver S9 enhanced
the ability of catechol and hydroquinone to induce SCEs
in cultured human lymphocytes. Tunek et al. have shown
that hydroquinone is further converted to p-benzosemi-
quinone and p-benzoquinone (210,211). These metabolites

PANCARCINOGENESIS OF BENZENE
ofhydroquinone, in addition to the metabolites ofcatechol
(presumably o-benzoquinone and o-hydroxy-p-benzosemi-
quinone), may contribute to the genetic toxicity induced
by benzene.
Numerous studies have documented a variety of chro-
mosomal aberrations in humans who have benzene-
associated myelotoxicity. Almost all humans with
benzene-associated leukemia were exposed to other
chemicals, although exposure to benzene was common to
all. The possibility exists, albeit equivocally, that other
chemicals in addition to benzene may have been involved
in the development of the leukemia, and this possibility
could help explain the failure to reproduce benzene-
associated leukemia is the present NTP studies or in
other such studies in experimental animals (212); nonethe-
less, benzene caused lymphomas in both sexes ofmice in
the NTP study. Cronkite et al. reported an increase in
lymphomas in female C57BL/6 mice exposed at 300 ppm
for 16 weeks and observed until death (125,213,214).
These authors suggest that prolonged exposures may
suppress the incidence of lymphomas or shorten the life-
span ofmice, so lymphomas cannot be observed. Even so,
perhaps rodents are not adequate models for human leu-
kemogenesis.
In this regard, Post et al. found that p-benzoquinone in-
hibited T-cell growth factor interleukin-2 (IL-2), and ben-
zene and p-benzoquinone inhibited RNA synthesis in
mouse spleen lymphocytes at concentrations that had no
significant effect on lymphocyte viability (215). Thus, the
inhibition of RNA synthesis in lymphocytes by benzene
may prevent the production of factors (IL-2) required for
hematopoiesis and contribute to the aplastic anemia
caused by benzene. Similarly, benzoquinone was the most
potent inhibitor of DNA synthesis in mouse L5178Y cells
followed by hydroquinone, benzenetriol, catechol, and
phenol (216). In addition, DNA adducts were formed, iso-
lated, and partially characterized from rat liver
mitoplasts incubated with benzene (217).
The malignant cells of most neoplasia, including lym-
phomas and leukemias, have chromosomal abnormalities,
and for most, specific chromosomal defects are associated
with specific neoplasia (218). Thus, it is not surprising that
benzene induced fragile sites in cultured human lympho-
cytes and that these sites correlated with chromosomal
break points known to occur in cancer cells (219).
Interestingly, benzene (or metabolites) causes
cytogenetic abnormalities, such as chromosomal aberra-
tions, SCEs, and micronuclei, but does not cause gene
mutations. Most ofthe positive results obtained with ben-
zene have been obtained from in vivo systems in which
cytogenetic end points have been measured. It will be in-
teresting to learn ifbenzene is positive in a somatic-cell,
gene-mutation assay in vivo. Ifit is not, then benzene will
have the distinction of being one of the few chemicals
known that is solely a clastogen (an agent that breaks
chromosomes) but does not cause gene mutations. Ifben-
zene is capable of inducing gene mutations in vivo, then
the disparity between the positive in vivo cytogenetic
results and the negative in vitro gene mutation results
would be explained by the fact that reactive metabolites
of benzene are formed in vivo.
In summary, benzene has been long recognized as a
hazardous chemical in the workplace and to a lesser ex-
tent in the general environment. Definitive evidence now
exists that benzene induces multiple-site neoplasia in lab-
oratory rodents. This logically led to the forecast that
benzene would likely be associated with other tumor site
increases in humans as well (25). Unfortunately, this has
now been shown to be true (168,169).
A positive association has been established between oc-
cupational exposure to benzene and aplastic anemia and
acute myelogenous leukemia in workers, and as recorded
in these proceedings (169), benzene has now been asso-
ciated with several other tumor sites in humans (124).
Now that catechol has been shown to be a potent carcino-
gen for the forestomach of male rats (139) and because
there appear to be increases in leukemia in female rats
and in liver neoplasia in mice (primarily female) exposed
to hydroquinone (142), one can begin to better understand
the multiplicity of responses observed in the present
studies (Tables 23-26). Benzene most likely undergoes
metabolism to several active metabolites, each of which
might be associated with one or more ofthe site-specific
neoplasms induced. When the target site, for instance the
hematopoietic system, for two metabolites is the same,
then both of these (hydroquinone and phenol) could be
considered to influeTnce the response. Thus, if one
hypothesizes that each of several metabolites may exert
a carcinogenic effect in separate (or the same) target or-
gans, this may explain the pancarcinogenesis ofbenzene.
Given the number of potentially active metabolites (Fig.
5), and knowing that some have already been shown to
cause neoplasia in independent studies, then the possibil-
ity gains strength that these metabolites influence differ-
ent site speciflcities.
Further, benzene has induced a larger number of
unique sites ofneoplasia than any other ofthe nearly 375
chemicals studied under the aegis of the National Cancer
Institute or the National Toxicology Program (3-6).
Whether several or all metabolites (alone or in combina-
tion with benzene) induce the toxic, clastogenic, and car-
cinogenic effects awaits further definitive study. Mean-
while the OSHA has promulgated a 10-fold lower
permissible occupational exposure level, from 10 ppm to
1 ppm (25) to better protect public health.
Conclusions
Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies,
there was clear evidence of carcinogenicity ofbenzene for
male F344/N rats, for female F344/N rats, for male
B6C3F1 mice, and for female B6C3F1 mice. For male
rats, benzene caused increased incidences of Zymbal
gland carcinomas, squamous cell papillomas and squa-
mous cell carcinomas ofthe oral cavity, and squamous cell
papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. For
female rats, benzene caused increased incidences ofZym-
bal gland carcinomas and squamous cell papillomas and
squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity. For male
157

mice, benzene caused increased incidences of Zymbal
gland squamous cell carcinomas, malignant lymphomas,
alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas and alveolar/bronchiolar
adenomas or carcinomas (combined), Harderian gland
adenomas, and squamous cell carcinomas ofthe preputial
gland. For female mice, benzene caused increased inci-
dences of malignant lymphomas, ovarian granulosa cell
tumors, ovarian benign mixed tumors, carcinomas and
carcinosarcomas of the mammary gland, alveo-
lar/bronchiolar adenomas, alveolar/bronchiolar carci-
nomas, and Zymbal gland squamous cell carcinomas.
