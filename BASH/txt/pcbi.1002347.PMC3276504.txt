Abstract
The cost and time to develop a drug continues to be a major barrier to widespread distribution of medication. Although the
genomic revolution appears to have had little impact on this problem, and might even have exacerbated it because of the
flood of additional and usually ineffective leads, the emergence of high throughput resources promises the possibility of
rapid, reliable and systematic identification of approved drugs for originally unintended uses. In this paper we develop and
apply a method for identifying such repositioned drug candidates against breast cancer, myelogenous leukemia and
prostate cancer by looking for inverse correlations between the most perturbed gene expression levels in human cancer
tissue and the most perturbed expression levels induced by bioactive compounds. The method uses variable gene
signatures to identify bioactive compounds that modulate a given disease. This is in contrast to previous methods that use
small and fixed signatures. This strategy is based on the observation that diseases stem from failed/modified cellular
functions, irrespective of the particular genes that contribute to the function, i.e., this strategy targets the functional
signatures for a given cancer. This function-based strategy broadens the search space for the effective drugs with an
impressive hit rate. Among the 79, 94 and 88 candidate drugs for breast cancer, myelogenous leukemia and prostate cancer,
32%, 13% and 17% respectively are either FDA-approved/in-clinical-trial drugs, or drugs with suggestive literature
evidences, with an FDR of 0.01. These findings indicate that the method presented here could lead to a substantial increase
in efficiency in drug discovery and development, and has potential application for the personalized medicine.

Introduction
The average research and development (R&D) cost for the 10-
odd years to develop a new pharmaceutical now exceeds a billion
dollars [1,2]; anti-cancer drugs being especially costly [2]. The
process encompasses compound identification, toxicity testing in
animals, early phase clinical trails, and efficacy in late phase trials.
The failure of more than 90% of drugs during development [1], is
perhaps the single greatest contributor to overall cost of
pharmaceutical R&D. This cost in time and money can in
principle be substantially reduced by repositioning drugs that are
already approved for other purposes.
One way to screen approved drugs for new purposes is
computationally. Computational chemistry provides valuable
contributions in hit- and lead-compound discovery [3]. Systems
biology approaches have also been recently used to capture the
complexity of drug discovery and repositioning [4,5]. Computa-
tional approaches have rarely, however, been a key contributor to
drug discovery or repositioning [3]. This is in part because the
majority of the studies focus only a few genes/proteins [6], either
as the drug targets, or ‘‘disease signatures’’ while there is increasing
evidence that many effective drugs act on multiple rather than
single targets [4], and evidence is starting to emerge that
pathologies can be a consequence of small abnormalities in many
genes, rather than major abnormalities in a few genes [7,8]. In
addition, many existing methods constrain search space by
imposing similarity requirements–including similarity of ligand
structures [9], expression profile of drug response [10], topological
similarity of target-drug, drug-drug and disease-drug [11,12]
networks, and side-effect similarity [13], which diminishes the
effectiveness of de novo drug discovery.
The main idea underlying a number of current methods,
including the one presented here, is to identify genes whose
expressions are reverse correlated under disease and drug
perturbations [14,15,16]. Our approach, however, uses functional
signatures rather than gene signatures. Ideally a functional
signature would be represented by pathways or other functional
modules that are perturbed by the disease and restored by drugs.
The utility of such a definition is limited by lack of a
comprehensive set of functional modules/pathways. We therefore
adapted an alternative approach that identifies a drug for
repositioning when the reverse ordered lists of disease perturbed

and drug perturbed genes has a statistically significant overlap. We
thereby remove the requirement for representing a disease by a
fixed number of genes. Because we use a large number of genes in
our analysis, we filter out genes that are expressed differently
between untreated cell line and disease samples; a step that is
generally not present in gene signature based methods.
Our approach allows the detection of heterogeneous drug
candidates that may restore cellular functions through different
paths, in keeping with the idea that drugs acting selectively on
multiple targets may be more efficacious than single-target agents,
and that a particular physiological process may be modulated by
multiple paths. This is in contrast to other approaches which either
use a fixed small number of genes as the disease signature
[14,15,16] or limit candidates to drugs whose properties (such as
expression profiles) are similar to those of existing drugs
[9,10,11,12,13].
As with other approaches [14,15,16] we utilize two databases:
the Connectivity Map (CMAP) which provides information on
expressed genes in cancer cell lines perturbed by bioactive
compounds [6,14], and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
[17], which stores transcript levels for various cancers. We
consider as potential candidates, compounds that down (up)-
regulate cell-line genes which are up (down)-regulated in
transformed tissue cells. We use a three-step strategy to identify
candidate compounds. First, we compare the expression of genes
in the untreated cell line and the cancer tissue sample, and retain
genes that are expressed in both. Second, we download the ranked
list of perturbed cell line genes from CMAP, and generate a
ranked list of genes from tissue samples ranked by differential
expression. Both steps are designed to make the expression data
comparable between cell lines and cancer samples. Finally, as
shown in Fig. 1, we compare the K (window size) most up-
regulated genes in the tissue (UC) against the K most down-
regulated genes in the cell line list (DB), for each compound. We
assume a compound is a candidate for repositioning if there is
significant number of overlapping genes between UC and DB, and
vice versa.
We illustrate that this new strategy with database integration
and straightforward statistical analysis is able to identify a
remarkably large number of plausible candidates for myelogenous
leukemia, prostate and breast cancer. Of the more than 1300
CMAP compounds, 4 are currently in use against breast cancer, 5
against myelogenous leukemia and 3 against prostate cancer. Our
analysis returned 1 of the 4, 2 of the 5 and 1 of the 3. The relative
plausibility of the candidates is further indicated by the fact that
11/45, 5/50 and 6/50 candidates for repositioning against breast
cancer, myelogenous leukemia and prostate cancer, respectively,
are currently in clinical trials for those diseases, these statistics
summarizing the most important indicators of performance. These
results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, but
also hint the potential application of the approach for the
personalized medicine by reverse-correlating of patient’s expres-
sion profile against the expression profiles of all available drugs, as
detailed in the discussion section.
Results
Statistics of significant bioactive compounds
Breast cancer. As shown in Table 1, we detected 28
bioactive compounds from correlations between genes that are
up-regulated in cancer (UC) and down-regulated in response to
bioactive compounds (DB), and another 62 by comparing genes
down-regulated in cancer (DC) to those up-regulated by bioactive
compounds (UB). Of the 90, 80 either up-regulate down-regulated
cancer genes (DC/UB), or down-regulate up-regulated cancer
genes (UC/DB); another 10 display duality; i.e. they do both.
Consequently, we identified 80 distinct compounds; 46 of them are
FDA approved. CMAP includes 4 FDA approved drugs for breast
cancer. We recovered one of them, fulvestrant, which displays
duality (Table 2 and Table S1); i.e. it down-regulates genes that
are highly up-regulated in breast cancer, and also up-regulates
genes that are highly down-regulated. The remaining 45 are FDA
approved for diseases other than breast cancer and are therefore
candidates for repositioning.
Myelogenous leukemia. We detected 89 (UC/DB) and 26
(DC/UB) bioactive compounds for myelogenous leukemia, 96 of
which are distinct (19 show duality), and of those, 52 are FDA
approved. Of the five CMAP compounds currently in use against
myelogenous leukemia, we recovered 2 (etoposide and
prednisone), leaving 50 candidates for repositioning.
Prostate cancer. We detected 83 (UC/DB) and 88 (DC/UB)
bioactive compounds for prostate cancer. Of the 171, 89 are
distinct and 51 of these are FDA approved. We recovered one of
the 3 compounds in CMAP, which are FDA approved for prostate
cancer (diethylstidbestrol), leaving 50 potential candidates for
repositioning.
Supporting evidence
(i) Recall. As indicated above, our method recovered 1/4, 2/
5 and 1/3 of the CMAP compounds that are FDA approved for
breast cancer, myelogenous leukemia and prostate cancer,
respectively. We also note, as outlined below (iii), less direct, but
nonetheless important supporting evidence for potential efficacy of
a substantial number of identified compounds.
(ii) Clinical trials. Twenty-two of the predicted distinct
compounds that are FDA approved, and are consequently
candidates for repositioning, are in fact in clinical trials: 11 for
breast cancer, 5 for leukemia and 6 for prostate cancer,
representing 24% (11/45), 10% (5/50) and 12% (6/50) of the
distinct candidates for those diseases.
(iii) Other evidence. As summarized in Tables 1 and S1,
published results provide suggestive evidence for the potential
efficacy of an additional 13 distinct breast cancer candidates, 5
distinct leukemia candidates and 8 distinct prostate cancer
candidates. Six of the 13, three of the 5 and seven of the 8 are
FDA approved drugs, and are therefore candidates for
repositioning.
Author Summary
The effective drug of a given disease is aimed to bring
abnormal functions associated with disease back to the
normal state. Using expression profile as the surrogate
marker of the cellular function, we introduce a novel
procedure to identify candidate therapeutics by searching
for those bioactive compounds that either down-regulate
abnormally over-expressed genes, or up-regulate those
that are abnormally under-expressed. We show that the
approach detects a pool of plausible candidates as
repositioning/new drugs. In contrast to previous studies,
our approach uses a variable big number of genes and/or
gene combinations as a representation of functional
signatures to identify bioactive compounds that modulate
a given disease, irrespective of the particular genes that
contribute to the cellular functions; therefore it covers
potential drugs with heterogeneous properties. The
method may also have potential application for the
personalized medicine.

(iv) Functional plausibility. We defined perturbed
pathways as over-represented in genes that are significantly up
or down-regulated in diseased relative normal tissue, as
explained in Methods. We expect and find that for a given
disease, a number of pathways is perturbed by multiple
compounds. As elaborated below, identification of common

processes could provide clues about cancer biogenesis,
mechanism and treatment. We look for common processes
using a tandem approach: starting with pathway analysis for the
most specific relations, and Gene Ontology analysis to search for
higher order connections. We show that although the gene sets
used for reverse-correlation may be different for different drug
candidates, these genes involve many functions common to the
target cancer.

Pathways. We mapped highly up/down regulated genes (i.e.
those that are within our optimized windows (Table 1)) for a given
cancer onto KEGG pathways [18], and computed the Fisher
probability of chance allocation for each pathway, accepting only
pathways with p-values below 0.05. We found 9 pathways over-
represented in breast cancer with 7 in UC/DB and 2 in DC/UB.
The same analysis for myelogenous leukemia yielded 8 pathways –
5 in UC/DB and 3 in DC/UB (Fig. 2 and Table S6). The
pathways, as well as the corresponding top-ranking genes for the
two cancers for identified compounds are listed in Table S2 and
Table S3. For both cancers, there are no overlapping pathways
between UC/DB and DC/UB, indicating clear separation of up-
regulated and down-regulated pathways. The bacterial invasion of
epithelial cells, ErbB signaling, and focal adhesion pathways
appear to be strongly implicated in breast cancer, since almost all
identified compounds strongly perturb genes that fall into each of
those pathways (Fig. 2). For myelogenous leukemia, on the other
hand, the most strongly implicated pathways—apoptosis and the
cell cycle—each have genes that are perturbed by only slightly
more than 70% of the identified compounds. There is no overlap
of pathways between breast cancer and myelogenous leukemia,
even though alterations appear in a number of processes common
to both [19].
Over-represented pathways for breast cancer. Predicted
drug candidates for breast cancer are aimed at restoring
expression of genes that are up-regulated by the disease in seven
pathways: adherens junction, focal adhesion, ErbB signaling,
riboflavin metabolism, thiamine metabolism, nucleotide excision
repair and bacterial invasion of epithelial cells. The inhibition of
over-expressed genes in both the adherens junction and focal
adhesion pathways hints at the critical role of endothelial barrier
enhancement [20] to impede cancer cell extravasation. The over-
representation of the bacterial invasion pathway, on the other
hand, indicates augmented breast cancer cell invasiveness and
adhesiveness under conditions of bacterial infection. This suggests
that the increased risk of metastasis due to infection could be the
result of direct interaction of infectious bacteria, and not just
bacterially induced inflammation [21].
The involvement of the ErbB signaling pathway is not surprising
– it is well-known that the ErbB protein family or epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, especially ErbB-2 (HER-2),
is often over-expressed with aggressive clinical behavior and poor
outcome in patients with breast cancer [22]. In addition, the dual
inhibition of the focal adhesion and EGFR signaling pathways can
cooperatively enhance apoptosis in breast cancers [23]. The
identification of these pathways is consistent with the recent
development of therapy for breast cancer, i.e., targeting of ErbB-2
with trastuzumab, and vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGFA) with bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy
has proven to be a milestone in molecular targeted therapy for
breast cancer [24].
The over-representation of both the riboflavin (vitamin B2)
metabolism and thiamine (vitamin B1) metabolism pathways is
consistent with previously noted connections between vitamin B
complex and breast cancer [25]. In addition the serum levels of the
estrogen inducible riboflavin carrier protein, which occupies a key
position in riboflavin metabolism, may be useful as a new marker
to predict early-stage breast cancer [26].
Finally, the nucleotide excision repair pathway corrects DNA
damage caused by environmental toxins including cigarette smoke
and ultraviolet radiation. Polymorphisms in this pathway have
been reported in breast cancer patients [27], suggesting the
possibility of impaired repair and consequent accumulation of
mutations. More specifically a number of genes in this pathway,
such as ERCC4 (Table S2), are tightly associated with breast
cancer [28]. In addition, one of the important cancer-related
genes, P53, regulates excision repair through DNA damage
response genes such as GADD45 [29].
Genes whose expression is repressed by breast cancer and
increased by predicted drug candidates (DC/UB) are over-

represented in only two pathways. The involvement of the
cytochrome P450 (CYPs) pathway indicates that the CYPs may
be key enzymes in breast cancer formation and cancer treatment.
Their importance lies in the fact that they metabolize drugs used
for cancer treatment, and are therefore potential targets for
anticancer therapy [30]. Among our top ranking genes for
predicted breast cancer drugs are CYP2A6, and CYP2C19. Their
pronounced polymorphic [30] suggests that for any strategy
targeting them, individualized, or stratified therapy, could be
especially critical.
Disease genes that are highly perturbed are over-represented in
the ribosomal pathway. Many studies report that the morpholog-
ical and functional changes in the nucleolus are a consequence of
both the increased demand for ribosome biogenesis, and changes
in the mechanisms controlling cell proliferation. The loss or
functional changes in the two major tumor suppressor proteins,
retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and p53, cause an up-regulation of
ribosome biogenesis in many cancer tissues including breast cancer
[31]. On the other hand, some down-regulated ribosomal proteins,
such as RPL35A, RPL18 and RPL14 (Table S2) that we find in
both the breast cancer tissue and cell lines have received relatively
little attention [32] and might be worth pursuing.
Over-represented pathways for myelogenous leuke-
mia. We identified five pathways with gene sets that are
highly up-regulated in myelogenous leukemia, and highly down-
regulated by compounds: glycerolipid (triglyceride) metabolism,
glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI-anchor) biosynthesis, vascular smooth muscle contraction,
and transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) signaling. The first
three are components of lipid metabolism whose close association
to leukemia has been studied for decades [33]. Although abnormal
glycerolipid metabolism is well-known to be associated with
cardiovascular disease and diabetes, there is also strong evidence
that alkyl glycerolipids induce apoptosis of leukemia cell lines [34].
Disordered glycerophospholipid metabolism has been reported in
the leukemia cell line and retinoic acid treatment will suppress
the synthesis of ethanolamine-containing glycerophospholipids
[35]. The reported connection between the synthesis of GPI-
anchor and leukemia is indirect and uncommon: the deficiency of
GPI-anchor occurs in rare diseases including hemolytic anemia
and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). PNH often
develops in people with aplastic anemia which occasionally
transforms into leukemia [36].
The association between the TGF-b signaling pathway and
cancer is well known. The pathway is involved in tumor
suppression, as well as in tumor progression and invasion [37].
Its over-representation among over-expressed genes indicates that
in myelogenous leukemia it more likely behaves as a promoter.
This is consistent with recent observations that support a
permissive role for TGF-b in growth [38] and metastasis [39] of
established tumors.
There seems to be no direct association between the vascular
smooth muscle (VSM) contraction pathway and leukemia/cancer;
its over-representation may be the result of over-representation of
genes shared by relevant pathways. In particular examination of
the genes involved in the VSM pathway (Table S3) indicates that
the two most frequently appearing genes: PLA2G6 and ROCK2
are also genes in GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway and the TGF-b
pathway respectively; and TGF-b is known to promote the
contractile phenotype in VSM cells [40].
Three pathways have been reported among DC/UB genes; two
of them, apoptosis [41] and cell cycle [42] pathways, are well
known to be cancer-associated, and have been studied extensively
for myelogenous leukemia. While molecular defects in apoptotic
pathways are thought to often contribute to the abnormal
expansion of malignant cells and their resistance to chemotherapy,
the abnormality of the cell cycle pathway usually produces cells
with too many or too few chromosomes (aneuploidy), which is
frequently associated with the transition to leukemia. The third
pathway, the T-Cell receptor signaling pathway, is central to cell-
mediated immunity, which is invariably activated by tumor
associated antigens [43]. The down regulated T-cell receptor
signaling genes which are reactivated by the predicted drug
candidates include PTPRC, CD8A, CD3D and src family protein
kinase (FYN), all of which play key roles as triggering intracellular
signaling including activation-induced cell death [44].
Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis. In order
to obtain broader insight we examined enriched GO terms among
the identified gene sets using the GO Term Enrichment Analysis
(GOTEA) and batch mode of VisANT system [45]. For the
purpose of comparison, we use informative GO terms under which
there are more than 400 annotated genes with FDR,0.01, and
mark the terms using the abbreviation of corresponding KEGG
pathways whenever they can be matched. The detailed results are
listed in Table S4, S5. As expected, this analysis reveals more
cellular functions, as well as the cellular compartments where these
functions are carried out. Most of the over-represented pathways
are reproduced. More interestingly, this analysis also finds the GO
terms that are shared between UC/DB and DC/UB, probably
because some of the terms, such as ‘‘regulation of transport’’, are
not specific enough. We also find some GO terms common to
Tables S4 and Table S5, which may hint at how the drugs can be
repositioned between breast cancer and myelogenous leukemia.
Discussion
We introduced a novel procedure for identifying candidate
therapeutics from gene expression profiles. The general idea is that
viable drug candidates will be among those bioactive compounds
that either down-regulate abnormally over-expressed genes, or up-
regulate those that are abnormally under-expressed. We show that
the idea leads to a pool of plausible candidates for repositioning.
Targeting functions
One distinguishing feature of our method is that it targets
cellular functions rather than genes, i.e., the focus of the
method is to bring abnormal functions associated with disease
back to the normal state. This strategy is based on the
observation that diseases stem from failed/modified cellular
functions, regardless of which of the particular genes contrib-
uting to the function are aberrant [19]. For the purpose of
finding therapeutics, we do not have a fixed list of signature
genes for a given disease. Instead from a large set of ranked
differentially expressed genes for a particular disease, we find
compounds whose effect on the expression of most perturbed
genes is opposite that of the disease. This results in a number of
overlapping but different (for different compounds) subsets of
genes. On the other hand, for a particular disease the functions
associated with the subsets are similar. This characteristic of
variability at the level of genes, with conservation at the level of
function can be partially seen in Table S2, S3 where for each
drug candidate the list of genes is very different while the list of
pathways is similar.
We used mRNA expression as a surrogate measure of the
functional change because of its wide availability either for drug
response or disease perturbation. The method is, however,
applicable to other data types (protein expression, methylation
and so fourth).
Functional Signatures for Drug Repositioning

Since our method focuses on functional recovery and identifying
different but overlapping subsets of genes for different compounds,
it can cover potential drugs with heterogeneous properties. On the
other hand, we do find genes that are targeted by a large number
of our identified compounds. For example, LAMB1, CAV1 and
RPL35, tend to be targeted by most of predicted drugs for breast
cancer as shown in Table S2.
Mechanisms of action
The mechanisms and range of action of many current drugs are
poorly understood. Even drugs with known targets often have ‘‘off-
target’’ effects [5]. While many such effects are undesirable, some
of them provide the opportunity for repositioning. We have used
pathway analysis to interpret the functional rationale for
repositioning. The same analysis also provides some understand-
ing mechanism.
As an example, consider Tamoxifen, which is used extensively
for the treatment of both early and advanced estrogen receptor
positive (ER+) breast cancer [46]. Our results indicate that
tamoxifen is a candidate for repositioning to myelogenous
leukemia. In particular, the overrepresentation of genes in this
pathway, which are upregulated in myelogenous leukemia, and
down-regulated by Tamoxifen suggests the possibility that
aberrant TGF-b signaling plays a role in myelogenous leukemia.
Since TGF-b production is down-regulated by tamoxifen in other
tissues [47], tamoxifen might function as an anti-myelogenous
leukemia drug by repressing this pathway (Table S3).
This suggestion is supported by the fact that expression of
estrogen receptors ESR1 and ESR2 is relatively unaffected by
treatment with Tamoxifen (of the 20,469 ranked genes, ESR1 and
ESR2 ranked 4184 and 4734 respectively – well below the number
of top ranking genes used in the study: 700/800 for UC/DB and
DC/UB). Consequently it seems unlikely that the effect of
Tamoxifen on leukemic cells is mediated by these receptors.
We therefore speculate that tamoxifen acts similarly in breast
cancer, and thereby exerts its effects in a dual manner; i.e. through
inhibition of TGF-b, in addition to inhibition of estrogen.
Militating against this possibility are the facts that the TGF-b
pathway is not over-represented in UC/DB transcripts, and other
investigations did not find evidence for the regulation of TGF-b
genes/proteins by tamoxifen in breast cancer patients [48]. On the
other hand an increased expression of TGF-b1, which is often seen
in tumors of breast cancer patients, correlates with poor prognostic
outcome [49]. This apparent conflict might be resolved by the
recent discovery that tamoxifen decreases extracellular TGF-b1
proteins secreted from breast cancer cells, but not intracellular
ones [50]. This result is also compatible with our finding that the
adherens junction and focal adhesion pathways are both over-
represented in breast cancer cells, and these pathways are
potentially inducible by TGF-b [37]. These observation are in
line with other studies documenting decreased metastasis when
TGF-b signalling is blocked in high-grade breast tumor [51], and
suggest that tamoxifen represses the metastasis of breast cancer
cells by down regulating the TGF-b pathway and preventing loss
of polarity and cell–cell contacts.
Taken collectively, the functional analysis of our results suggests
a potential mechanism for tamoxifen, which is independent of an
interaction with the estrogen receptor, and has tamoxifen
suppressing tumor metastasis and growth by down-regulating
TGF-b signaling.
Beyond repositioning
Our results also suggest that some exploration of the identified non-
FDA approve drugs (new drug candidates) could be fruitful. If the
fraction of FDA approved drugs in clinical trials is taken as a measure
of what is worth exploring (i.e. we conservatively neglect other
supporting evidence), then we’d expect 8 of the 34 non-FDA approved
drugs for breast cancer to be ultimately worthy of clinical trials; and 4
of the 44 for myelogenous leukemia and 5 of the 38 for prostate cancer
(i.e. we’d expect this number to get through animal toxicity tests, and
efficacy tests when available, and enter phase 1 trials).
Limitation and future development
There are several issues that may limit the future development
of the approach. First, the optimization of the window size requires
availability of the known FDA-approved drugs in CMAP, which
may not always the case especially when expanding this approach
to the other diseases that are functionally close to the three
cancers. Second, the sensitivity of the approach to the subtype, or
the different stage, of the same disease needs to be studied further.
The approach will have great application to the personalized
medicine if it is able to identify different drugs for the disease at
different stages/subtype because the relative cheap price to get the
patient expression profile. Finally, although mRNA expression is
used to measure the functional change of the cell, we expected the
better results using the other data that may be more representative
of the cellular functions, such as protein expressions.
Materials and Methods
Transcript expression
Expression data in response to bioactive compounds for breast
cancer, prostate cancer and myelogenous leukemia cell lines were
obtained from the connectivity map (http://www.broad.mit.edu/
CMAP/) (Build 02) [6,14]. Differential expression data in response
to breast cancer (GDS2617), leukemia (GDS2908), and prostate
cancer (GDS1439) were obtained from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) [17]. The data sets are picked in such a way that there is
fairly big number of samples and the expressions are normalized
by GEO database. The ranked list of differentially expressed genes
for a given cancer is calculated using t-statistic.
Gene filtering
The bioactive compound specific signatures fetched from CMAP
are based on cell lines (i.e. cancerous cells with and without
treatments), while those from GEO were based on tissue cells (i.e.
normal and cancer tissue cells). Since the different cell types are not
directly comparable, we first normalized gene-expressions accord-
ing to the untreated cell line and the cancer tissue samples. We
retain only genes that are expressed in both tissue and cell line. In
particular we applied the t-test to the normalized scores, and
calculated the corrected p-values for multiple testing by a false
discovery rate (FDR) procedure. The FDR is defined as the
expected proportion of false positives among the significant results
and is a more appropriate measure than the raw p-value for multiple
hypotheses testing. The FDR threshold was set as 0.01, and the
genes with clearly different gene-expressions were removed from
both samples. As a result, we retained 15572 genes (77%), 20469
genes (92%), and 12220 genes (55%) for breast cancer, myelogenous
leukemia, and prostate cancer, respectively.
Comparison of reverse-correlated cancer and bioactive
compound specific gene sets
We prepared two types of ranked lists of genes. One was
generated from tissue samples ranked by differential expression
between normal and cancer tissues from GEO data. The other
was obtained from the ranked list of perturbed cell line genes from

CMAP. In the former case, the top and bottom k genes were
defined as up-regulated genes in cancer (UC) and down-regulated
genes in cancer (DC). In the latter case, the top and bottom k
genes were defined as up-regulated genes by bioactive compounds
(UB) and down-regulated genes by bioactive compounds (DB).
The genes of interest are the top and the bottom k genes in a
ranked list where k ranges from 100 to 10000 in increments of 100.
We counted overlapping genes in between UC and DB (UC/
DB) and in between DC and UB (DC/UB) to investigate
compounds up-regulating down-regulated cancer genes (DC/
UB), or down-regulating up-regulated cancer genes (UC/DB). We
performed the Fisher’s exact test to prove if the overlap is
significant by comparing the number of overlapping genes to that
of randomly selecting genes (background). The p-value was
transformed into FDA corrected for multiple hypotheses. The
FDR threshold was set as 0.01.
Choice of window size
For each value k, a compound is labeled as bioactive if the
number of overlapping genes (as explained in Fig. 1) is statistically
significant. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated by
measuring the proportions of true positives (fraction of FDA drugs
identified) and true negatives (fraction of identified compounds
that failed clinical trials). For each cancer, we chose values of k
(one for UC/DB and one for DC/UB) that gave maximum
specificity, subject to the constraint of non zero sensitivity (at least
1 correct prediction), non zero duality and a FDR less than 0.01.
In this way we identified for further investigation, a total of 90
compounds (and associated genes) for breast cancer (28 suppres-
sors of up-regulated cancer genes; 62 enhancers of down-regulated
genes); 36 compounds for myelogenous leukemia (10 suppressors;
26 enhancers), and 171 compounds for prostate cancer (83
suppressors; 88 activators). The results regarding different window
size are presented in Table S7 and Fig. S1.
Pathway over-representation analysis
We mapped correlated genes in UC/DB and in DC/UB onto
the KEGG pathways and counted the number of genes mapped
and total number of existing genes with respect to each pathway.
Given the number of genes and total number of all of genes we
used, a p-value is calculated with hypergeometic distribution [52];
we accepted only pathways with the p-values below 0.05 as over-
represented pathways [53].
Drug and clinical trail information retrieval
We collected data from KEGG DRUG Database (http://www.
genome.jp/kegg/drug/), DrugBank (http://www.drugbank.ca/)
and PharmGKB (http://www.pharmgkb.org/, email: ) to map
International Nonproprietary Name (INN) to generic names and
alias. FDA approved drugs were found from FDA service:
Drugs@FDA. All clinical trials data and references that we
checked for our predictions were shown in Table 2 and Table S1
with corresponding hyperlinks.
