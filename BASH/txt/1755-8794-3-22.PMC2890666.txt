Abstract
Background: The inability of aspirin (ASA) to adequately suppress platelet aggregation is associated with future risk of
coronary artery disease (CAD). Heritability studies of agonist-induced platelet function phenotypes suggest that
genetic variation may be responsible for ASA responsiveness. In this study, we leverage independent information from
genome-wide linkage and association data to determine loci controlling platelet phenotypes before and after
treatment with ASA.
Methods: Clinical data on 37 agonist-induced platelet function phenotypes were evaluated before and after a 2-week
trial of ASA (81 mg/day) in 1231 European American and 846 African American healthy subjects with a family history of
premature CAD. Principal component analysis was performed to minimize the number of independent factors
underlying the covariance of these various phenotypes. Multi-point sib-pair based linkage analysis was performed
using a microsatellite marker set, and single-SNP association tests were performed using markers from the Illumina 1 M
genotyping chip from deCODE Genetics, Inc. All analyses were performed separately within each ethnic group.
Results: Several genomic regions appear to be linked to ASA response factors: a 10 cM region in African Americans on
chromosome 5q11.2 had several STRs with suggestive (p-value < 7 × 10-4) and significant (p-value < 2 × 10-5) linkage to
post aspirin platelet response to ADP, and ten additional factors had suggestive evidence for linkage (p-value < 7 × 10-
4) to thirteen genomic regions. All but one of these factors were aspirin response variables. While the strength of
genome-wide SNP association signals for factors showing evidence for linkage is limited, especially at the strict
thresholds of genome-wide criteria (N = 9 SNPs for 11 factors), more signals were considered significant when the
association signal was weighted by evidence for linkage (N = 30 SNPs).
Conclusions: Our study supports the hypothesis that platelet phenotypes in response to ASA likely have genetic
control and the combined approach of linkage and association offers an alternative approach to prioritizing regions of
interest for subsequent follow-up.
Background
Platelet activation plays a critical role in atherothrom-
botic diseases such as acute myocardial infarction (MI)
and stroke. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) is a main-
stay of both primary and secondary prevention of MI and
stroke [1]. ASA inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and
thromboxane-dependent platelet activation, which
decreases the probability of acute thrombosis related
proximally to cardiac and stroke events [2-4]. Large aspi-
rin chemoprophylaxis trials, however, demonstrate that

many individuals fail to achieve the expected protective
benefits of therapy, presumably related to failure of ASA
to adequately suppress platelet activation [5-7]. Residual
platelet activation, from pathways directly and indirectly
related to COX-1, is reported to be related to greater risk
of MI and stroke in persons on aspirin therapy [8,9].
Previously, we have found evidence of moderate to high
heritability of platelet function phenotypes, in both the
presence [10] and absence of aspirin [11], suggesting that
genetic variants contribute to differences among individ-
uals in platelet activation and response to aspirin therapy.
In this study, we take advantage of two alternative plat-
forms of genotype data available, a linkage panel of mic-
rosatellite markers (STRs) and a genome-wide
association study (GWAS) panel of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), in a combined linkage and asso-
ciation approach to search for loci controlling pheno-
types in known platelet activation pathways.
Methods
Subjects
The study protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins
Institutional Review Board, and all subjects gave written
informed consent. Subjects were identified from Euro-
pean American and African American families with pre-
mature coronary artery disease (CAD) through a proband
with documented CAD prior to 60 years of age. Appar-
ently healthy siblings of the probands, the adult offspring
of both the probands and their siblings, and the coparents
of the offspring were recruited for the Genetic Study of
Aspirin Responsiveness (GeneSTAR). GeneSTAR was
designed to examine genetic and environmental determi-
nants of platelet function in response to low-dose aspirin
therapy. Eligible subjects were ≥ 21 years of age and had
no history of any coronary heart disease, thrombotic
event, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, transient isch-
emic attacks, known derangement in hematologic pro-
files (aplastic anemia, Sickle Cell Disease, von
Willebrand's Disease, Factor V Leiden), renal or hepatic
failure, autoimmune diseases, glucocorticosteroid use,
hemorrhagic event, measured blood pressure ≥ 180/105
mmHg or current pregnancy. Subjects were also excluded
if they had an allergy or intolerance to ASA, baseline
platelet count ≤ 100,000 or ≥ 500,000 cells/μL, hematocrit
≤ 30%, or white blood cell count ≥ 20,000 cells/μL. Anti-
coagulants, ASA, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents,
illicit drugs, were proscribed for 14 days before the base-
line visit and during the study interval. Consumption of
tea and coffee and flavenol-rich foods (egg, wine, grape
juice, chocolate) and other dietary items known to affect
platelet function (fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids and gar-
lic) were prohibited for 24 hours and smoking for 12
hours prior to assessments. Subjects with zero aggrega-
tion of platelets to arachidonic acid in both whole blood
and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) at the baseline visit and
questionable adherence to the list of proscribed sub-
stances, were omitted from the study. At the end of the
first screening visit, eligible subjects were given a supply
of 81-mg ASA tablets and instructed to take 1 pill each
day for 14 days. Adherence to ASA use during the study
was assessed at the post-ASA visit using pill counts and
an adapted standardized medication adherence question-
naire [12].
Laboratory Measurements
Blood for the measurement of platelet function in whole
blood (WB) and platelet rich plasma (PRP) was obtained
by venipuncture at the same time of day at baseline and
following 14 days of ASA therapy. Baseline and post-ASA
measures included aggregation, slope, and lag time in
response to selected doses of 4 known platelet agonists,
and urinary excretion of the thromboxane B2 metabolite
11- dehydrothromboxane B2 (Tx-M). Optical aggregation
was measured in PRP in a PAP-4 aggregometer (Hor-
sham, PA) after samples were stimulated with arachi-
donic acid (1.6 mmol/L, collagen (1, 2, 5 μg/mL), ADP (2,
10 mmol/L), and epinephrine (2, 10 μmol/L). Whole
blood impedance aggregometry was measured in a
Chrono-Log dual-channel lumiaggregometer (Haver-
town, PA) after samples were stimulated with arachidonic
acid (0.5 mmol/L), collagen (1, 5 μg/mL), and ADP (10
μmol/L). Platelet function under shear stress was deter-
mined by the platelet function analyzer (PFA) test (PFA-
100, Dade- Behring, Newark, DE). Whole blood was
loaded into standard proprietary cartridges (Dade-Beh-
ring) containing collagen and epinephrine, and aperture
closure time was recorded in seconds (maximum of 300
seconds).
Plasma fibrinogen was assayed in the Johns Hopkins
Clinical Coagulation Laboratory and von Willebrand fac-
tor (vWF) was measured using enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assays (DiaPharma, West Chester, OH).
Urine was collected at the same time of day for pre- and
post-ASA measurements of Tx-M using an enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (Cayman Chemical Co.,
Ann Arbor, MI) and values were normalized to urinary
creatinine.
Cardiac Risk Factor Evaluation
Blood pressure was measured according to methods of
the American Heart Association and hypertension was
defined as the average of 4 resting blood pressures ≥ 140/
90 mm Hg and/or the taking of antihypertensive medica-
tions. Current smoking was defined as any reported ciga-
rette smoking within the past 30 days and nonsmoking
status was validated by exhaled CO levels < 8 ppm on the
average of 2 measurements. Height and weight were mea-
sured and body mass index was calculated as the weight

(kg)/height squared (m2). Plasma glucose, total choles-
terol, triglyceride, and HDL-cholesterol levels were mea-
sured after patients had fasted for 12 hours overnight.
LDL cholesterol was estimated using the Friedewald
equation. Diabetes was defined as self-reported diabetes
with the use of diabetes medications, or measured glu-
cose levels ≥ 126 mg/dl.
Genotyping
Microsatellite genotyping was performed at deCODE
Genetics, Inc. with the standard deCODE 550 STR
marker set (average spacing = 8 cM). There were 574 suc-
cessfully released STR markers with an overall duplicate
error rate (3 CEPH sample duplicates on each of 18
plates) of 0.1% and an overall Mendelian error rate of 2%
on 99.7% of samples. The STR genotyping data were
checked for Mendelian inconsistencies using PED-
CHECK [13], and all persons with inconsistencies were
removed prior to analysis. The most likely relationship
between pairs of relatives was inferred using RELCHECK
[14], and these were used to verify self-reported relation-
ships. SIBPAIR (v 0.99.9) was used to calculate allele fre-
quencies where the contribution of each pedigree is
weighted by the number of founders it contains.
SNP genotyping was performed at deCODE Genetics,
Inc. using the Human 1Mv1_C array from Illumina, Inc.
and 1,044,977 markers were released with an average call
rate per sample of 99.65% and an overall missing data rate
of 0.35%. Using 25 duplicate pairs of CEPH samples, the
reproducibility rate was >99.95% for all duplicate pairs.
Analyses at deCODE Genetics revealed Mendelian errors
(> 5%) in 14 samples, which were eliminated from further
analysis. Finally, 9 samples with gender discrepancies and
an additional 3,427,500 inconsistency calls over all SNPs
were eliminated from the final data prior to analyses.
While all markers were analyzed, SNPs were flagged for
closer examination where minor allele frequency was low
(2%) and/or deviation from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium
was severe (p-value < 10-6).
Statistical Methods
Given the large number of potentially different biologi-
cally-related platelet function cascades examined [10],
principal components analysis (PCA) was used to define
a set of independent factors that explained a large pro-
portion of the phenotypic co-variance. PCA was run sep-
arately for European Americans and African Americans
within each of three major groups of outcome pheno-
types: (1) baseline, representing native platelet function,
(2) post-aspirin, representing platelet function measures
after 2 weeks of daily aspirin, and (3) post-aspirin platelet
function adjusted for pre-aspirin platelet function, repre-
senting the change attributable to aspirin, or aspirin
responsiveness. Prior to PCA, all platelet variables were
first adjusted for age and sex, levels of LDL cholesterol,
fibrinogen, and body mass index, and for the presence of
diabetes, hypertension, and current smoking using linear
regression models. For PFA test only, von Willebrand's
factor was included in the adjustment. Following adjust-
ment for covariates, there were 37 pre-ASA platelet func-
tion variables, 32 post-ASA variables, and 27 post-
adjusted for pre-ASA variables within each race with dis-
tributions that were adequate to enable calculation of
accurate Z-scores. All Z-scored variables were then used
for PCA in PROC Factor in SAS version 9.1 implement-
ing orthogonal varimax rotations. Eight components with

Eigenvalues > 1 were identified for the pre-ASA variables,
post ASA and post-adjusted for pre-ASA variables within
each race. The components were labeled by their primary
platelet phenotypic variables, defined as loadings > 0.4.
These final PCA components were used in the tests for
linkage and additional association analyses described
below.
Linkage analysis was performed with the Haseman-
Elston regression approach [15] in SAGE (v 5.1.0) for
each principal component and each STR for each ethnic
group separately. In these analyses the traditional Hase-
man-Elston analysis for a quantitative trait (i.e. the
regression of the squared traits difference on the IBD
estimate) was performed on full sib relationships under a
multipoint approach. This approach has been shown to
be adequately robust and powered even for sample sizes
with less than 300 sib-pairs [16]. We used p-values
defined by Lander and Kruglyak [17] to represent specific
LOD score thresholds: (1) suggestive linkage with p value
= 0.00074 and corresponding LOD = 2.2; (2) significant
linkage with p-value = 0.00002 and corresponding LOD =
3.6; and (3) highly significant linkage with p- value =
0.0000003 and corresponding LOD = 5.4.
Associations between SNPs on the GWAS panel and
factors that had evidence for linkage based on the analy-
ses described above were tested using linear mixed effects
models (LME). In the formulation of the LME model,
SNP genotypes were included as fixed effects setting the
genotypes to be additive in effect, and family identifica-
tion number was included in the random effects (essen-
tially treating the correlations between all pairs of
individuals in the family as equal). We tested whether the
additive effects of each SNP was different from zero. The
LME in SAS (v. 9.1.3 for Linux OS) was applied with
PROC MIXED using the option for EMPIRICAL vari-
ance.
In an attempt to offset the diminished power to detect
association that arises as a result of multiple testing issues
inherent in genomic searches and to determine the best
set of loci to pursue in further follow-up studies (i.e. to
control false positive association signals) in the absence
of external replication data, we used the False Discovery
Rate (FDR) approach proposed by Roeder et al [18]. This

new weighted FDR methodology involves weighting the
association test p-values on the basis of prior data derived
from linkage. A combined map was obtained; interpolat-
ing the STRs with the SNP map by assigning a physical
location (in Mb) to the mid-point of the STR. Using p-
values from the linkage scan at these assigned physical
locations, continuous linkage traces were derived from
the standard normal cumulative distribution and used to
weight the association p-values prior to the calculation of
the FDR threshold. In this analysis we used Storey's FDR
approach [19] which can be more powerful than that pro-

Results
Clinical data on agonist-induced platelet function, PFA,
and Tx-M phenotypes were evaluated in healthy subjects
with a family history of premature CAD before and after
a 2-week trial of ASA (81 mg/day). There were 1231
European American subjects (45% male) from 398 fami-
lies, and 846 African Americans (38% male) from 243
families. Linkage analysis was performed using 257 sib-
pairs in European Americans and 158 in African Ameri-
cans. The clinical characteristics of the population are
presented on Table 1.
Figure 1 illustrates the principal components derived
from the individual platelet phenotypes for the three
major phenotype groups (pre-ASA, post-ASA, post-
adjusted for pre-ASA). For each principal component, the
phenotypes that had factor loadings > 0.4 are labeled in
color, and several key points emerge. While there are dif-

ferences in the exact phenotypes and their precise load-
ings, the identity related to an underlying biological
pathway and the order of the principal components was
similar for European Americans and African Americans
for each of the three major phenotype groups. The phe-
notypes appear to cluster largely by agonist, followed by
dose and/or nature of the measure (i.e. slope vs. lag vs.
aggregation) in loading onto factors. In fact, all of the
major phenotype groups in both ethnicities contained
principal components for collagen aggregation in PRP,
epinephrine induced aggregation (EPI), ADP induced
aggregation in PRP (PRPADP), and lag time to aggrega-
tion in PRP.
Most of the principal components were heritable, as
shown in Table 2. The great majority of heritability esti-
mates ranged from 0.26 - 0.70 in European Americans
and 0.29 - 0.84 in African Americans. A few, however,
appeared to have either low estimates of heritability (e.g.,
< 0.10) or estimates with large standard errors (Table 2).

pean American and African American pedigrees, respec-
tively, presenting all signals with at least suggestive

significant linkage (p-value < 2 × 10-5) a ~10 cM region
on chromosome 5q11.2 appears to be linked to a post-
ASA principal component representing aggregation to
ADP in whole blood (Factor 4B (POST): ADP) in African
Americans; no significant evidence was noted in Euro-
pean Americans. In addition, a total of eleven factors, five
in European Americans and six in African Americans,
appear to have suggestive evidence for linkage across
fourteen regions in the genome. The single most striking
feature of these results in Tables 3 and 4 is that the evi-
dence for linkage is observed largely for the post- and
post-adjusted-for-pre-ASA factors, i.e. platelet response
to aspirin intervention therapy.
Figure 2 illustrates the evidence for association in these
regions of suggestive and significant linkage, specifically
focusing on a 10 cM (i.e. ~10 Mb) region centered on
each STR marker that had a linkage p-value < 7 × 10-4 (see
Tables 3 and 4), and restricted to those specific eleven
factors linked to these regions. While there does not
appear to be significant association signal in these regions
at full genome-wide association criteria (p-value < 10-8),
seven SNPs reach a region-specific Bonferroni threshold
(p < 0.05/n, where n = number of SNPs in each specific
region of linkage) as presented in Additional file 1.
Full genome-wide tests for association in these six fac-
tors in African Americans and five in European Ameri-
cans with suggestive evidence for linkage (p-value < 7 ×
10-4 in Tables 3 and 4) reveal little signal that meets the
strict Bonferroni GWAS criteria (p-value < 10-8). Specifi-
cally, 9 SNPs met these criteria as indicated in Table 5. In
the absence of external validation of our association
results from replication studies, we maximize informa-
tion available in our data to determine the best set of sig-
nals to take forward to further follow-up studies. We used
weighted FDR methods for the association tests that take
into account linkage information and we observed an
increase in signals now considered to be significant at
GWAS criteria relying on FDR methodology. With this
approach, 30 signals now meet these new FDR-defined
criteria as indicated in Table 5. To illustrate the added
benefit of this combined approach Figure 3 depicts the
un-weighted GWAS p-values along with the multi-point
linkage signal (in red) in Panel A alongside the newly link-
age-weighted p-values and new significance threshold in
Panel B for factor 4B(POST):ADP. It is clear that the sig-
nals of association are not restricted to regions of peak
linkage, but are in fact in regions with modest linkage. Of
the nine signals detected by the stringent Bonferroni un-
weighted approach, eight are significant with the linkage
weights applied and one signal appeared to be no longer
of significance when the linkage evidence was considered.
Discussion
To date only specific agonists or single pathway platelet
function phenotypes have been examined offering little
insight into the potentially complex interplay among

mixed models along with the linkage traces in red, and [B] linkage weighted P-values.

platelet function cascades. The GeneSTAR study is the
most comprehensive assessment of platelet response to
aspirin done to date and given the cost, labor intensive-
ness, and methodologic difficulty in measuring platelet
function across multiple agonists and doses in a large
sample size, it is unlikely that another study of this mag-
nitude will exist to support external validation of associa-
tion signals. The PCA-derived traits represent novel
variables that take into account the naturally occurring
correlations among important platelet variables. While
the PCA-derived phenotypic values are not in and of
themselves intuitively informative, they enable the identi-
fication of possibly important loci for more integrated
platelet phenotypes that represent baseline platelet func-
tion or true global responses to aspirin.
We noted linkage in fourteen regions of the genome for
eleven factors; interestingly, only one single linkage signal
was found for factors representing baseline platelet func-
tion. The reasons for this are uncertain, but there is likely
to be a greater variability in phenotype in native platelets
as compared with measurements following ASA adminis-
tration. ASA inhibits thromboxane-related aggregation, a
pathway which augments aggregation to a variable extent,
in a positive feedback loop initiated by other agonists,
such as collagen. By removing variability in platelet func-
tion associated with the thromboxane pathway, ASA
treatment may increase the ability to detect genotype-
phenotype association signals related to the remaining
platelet activation pathways.
Genome-wide association studies rapidly emerged as
the leading tool in the identification of disease suscepti-
bility loci in the recent past [21] and have proved success-
ful in mapping novel and previously not implicated loci
for a multitude of diseases [22-24]. However, these stud-
ies have largely been successful in mapping trait/disease-
associated SNPs that are common (with median risk
allele frequency shown to be 36%) and having only mod-
est effect sizes (median odds ratio OR 1.33) [25] that
together only account for a small fraction of the total risk/
variance of the diseases/traits [26]. With much of the
genetic variation in these traits as yet left to discover,
attention has been focused on issues of increased sample
size, incorporating more than main effects of SNPs (i.e.
accounting for gene*environment and gene*gene interac-
tions), capturing variation not assessed in commercial
GWAS arrays (i.e. low frequency variants and copy num-
ber variants) and region/gene-based signals rather than
pure SNP-SNP replication [27]. Another approach would
be to leverage prior information in the evaluation and
prioritization of genome wide association signal [18].
Here, the availability of linkage and association informa-
tion from two independent methods of analysis provides
this unique opportunity, allowing us to prioritize signals
for future follow-up based on the combined signal from
both approaches.
While many significant association signals are inter-
genic, several genes are identified in Table 5, some of
which are related to pathways known to be involved with
platelet function. One such example in European Ameri-
cans is MME (a membrane metalloendopeptidase) on
chromosome 3q21-27, associated with ASA response to
collagen induced aggregation in PRP).
Conclusions
Given that GeneSTAR is the most comprehensive assess-
ment of platelet response to aspirin done to date, this also
leads to two general weaknesses: our limited sample size
for linkage and the lack of external replication. In light of
these two limitations, we have implemented several novel
approaches to best search for susceptibility loci, imple-
menting the principal component approach to first find
factors that represent the underlying biological correla-
tion between the multitude of measured phenotypes and
the combined approaches of linkage and association with
two sets of marker data. In conclusion, this study is
unique in its ability to identify loci controlling platelet
response to aspirin intervention in both European Amer-
ican and African American families identified to be at
risk for CAD, and our combined novel approaches have
yielded several loci that we believe worthy of further fol-
low up.
