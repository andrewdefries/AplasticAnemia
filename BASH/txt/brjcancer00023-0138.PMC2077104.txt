colony-stimulating factor: increased efficacy and reduced toxicity when
given subcutaneously

Summary Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a haematopoietic growth factor
with a wide variety of applications in the clinic. In early phase I studies the continuous intravenous (c.i.) route
of administration was often used. Later it was shown that subcutaneous (s.c.) administration was also effective.
The optimal route of administration remains, however, poorly defined, and no studies have made a direct
comparison between these two routes of administration. We treated patients with advanced breast cancer with
moderately high-dose doxorubicin and cylophosphamide and GM-CSF. The first 14 patients received GM-CSF
by c.i, while subsequently 47 patients received it s.c. Comparison between the two groups showed that c.i. GM-
CSF was more toxic in several respects. There was a higher need for erythrocyte and platelet transfusions and a
significant deterioration in the performance status. This study indicates that subcutaneous GM-CSF is the
preferred route of administration. Randomised trials are, however, needed to confirm these conclusions.

Granulocyte- macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-
CSF) is a haematopoietic growth factor that stimulates the
proliferation, maturation and functional properties of
neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages and eosinophils (Ruef,
1990). A wide variety of therapeutic applications have
evolved for this cytokine. It facilitates haematopoietic
recovery after cytotoxic therapy (Harmenberg, 1994), and
some trials also showed a reduction in the incidence of
neutropenic fever (Gerhartz et al., 1993; Kaplan et al., 1991).
In the setting of bone marrow transplantation or peripheral
blood progenitor cell transplantation GM-CSF is used either
to shorten the time to engraftment or for the mobilisation of
peripheral blood progenitor cells (Nemunaitis et al., 1991;
Gianni et al., 1989).
Several phase I studies showed that the biological activity
of GM-CSF in man is clearly dose dependent and that
effective doses are in the range of 1 to 20 ,g kg-' day-1
(Brandt et al., 1988; Antman et al., 1988; Groopman et al.,
1987; Steward et al., 1989; Vadhan-Raj et al., 1987). In these
studies GM-CSF was administered by intravenous (i.v.)
infusions of different duration, of which the 24 h continuous
infusion (c.i.) has been the most widely used. The optimal
dose and route of administration, however, remains poorly
defined, but certain data suggest that the dose might be in the
range of 250 Mg m-2 day-' (approximately 6 ,ug kg-' day-1)
(Edmonson et al., 1989). Lieschke et al. (1989) were the first
to show that the subcutaneous (s.c.) route of administration
at dosages of 3-15 ,ug kg-' was also effective at inducing
leucocytosis and was tolerated well by the patients.
No studies have made a direct comparison between c.i. and
s.c. GM-CSF. Comparison between studies is complicated
because different patient populations and different concomi-
tant therapies would be expected to influence the response to
GM-CSF. We performed a phase II study in which we treated
patients with advanced breast cancer with a dose-intensive
regimen of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in combina-
tion with GM-CSF. Initially a pilot study was done to
establish the dose for this regimen (Hoekman et al., 1991a).
The first patients received c.i. GM-CSF, the subsequent
patients received s.c. GM-CSF. Although it was not a
randomised trial, the identical chemotherapeutic regimen
and patient selection criteria for patients treated with either
GM-CSF c.i. or s.c. makes it possible to compare these two
routes of administration in terms of toxicity and efficacy.
Patients and methods
Patient selection
Eligible patients were women between 18 and 65 years of age
with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and a
performance status of 2 or less according to World Health
Organization (WHO) criteria. No prior chemotherapy for
advanced disease was allowed. Adequate bone marrow
function (white blood cell count >4.0 x 109 1-1 and platelet
count > 100 x 109 I-), renal function (serum creatinine
< 150 ,umol 1-1) and hepatic function (serum bilirubin
,<25 jimol 1-') were required. A history of cardiovascular
disease and/or a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
<50% were exclusion criteria. All patients gave written
informed consent and the protocol was approved by the
ethical and scientific review committees of the University
Hospital Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
Treatment
Treatment consisted of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide
by i.v. bolus injection every 21 days. E. coli-derive non-
glycosylated recombinant human GM - CSF 250 ,ug m-2
day-1
was started at day 2 and given for 10 days. The first
14 patients received GM-CSF c.i. via an implantable drug
delivery system (Port-A-Cath, Pharmacia Deltec, St Paul,
USA) and a portable infusion pump (CADD-1, Pharmacia
Deltec). In the subsequent 47 patients GM-CSF was given
s.c. The first six patients (group A) with c.i. GM-CSF
received it from the second cycle onwards. They had a
dose reduction of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in
cycles 3 and 5. The remaining eight patients with c.i. GM-
CSF (group B) and the 47 patients with s.c. GM-CSF (group
C) received GM-CSF from the first cycle onwards. They had

cycles 2 and 4. It was the intention to treat patients with six
cycles, but when a complete remission was reached earlier
only one extra cycle was given as consolidation. Treatment
was delayed for 1 week if the neutrophil count was <2 x
109 1-1, platelets were < 100 x 109 I1-, or in the presence of
active infection, mucositis or if the performance status had
deteriorated to WHO grade 3 or 4. Erythrocyte transfusions
were given when the haemoglobin level decreased to
<6.0 mmol 1-1, and prophylactic platelet transfusions were
given when the platelet count was <10 x 109 1 -1, or at
higher counts when evidence of bleeding was observed. When
there was a decline in LVEF below 50% chemotherapy was
discontinued. Fever was judged to be neutropenic fever

temperature was 38.5°C lasting more than 4 h, and
neutrophils were below 0.5 x 10 1-'.
Clinical and laboratory monitoring
While on treatment, all patients had a medical history,
physical examination, baseline laboratory tests, chest radio-
graph and ECG before each cycle. Patients had a physical
examination weekly. Between cycles they were asked to
record their axillary temperature twice daily and to note any
specific complaints. Full blood counts, including differential
cell counts, were performed three times a week. Biochemical
analysis was carried out weekly. LVEF was performed every
second cycle and before the sixth cycle. Tumour response was
evaluated before each cycle for patients with locally advanced

breast cancer and every second cycle for patients with
metastatic breast cancer. Response and toxicities were scored
according to WHO criteria.
Statistical analysis
For toxicity as well as for erythrocyte and platelet
transfusion, the percentage of patients with c.i. GM-CSF
with a certain event were compared with the percentage of
patients with s.c. GM-CSF with a certain event. Further-
more, all cycles with c.i. GM-CSF were compared with all
cycles with s.c. GM-CSF. Differences were assessed by
Fisher's exact test (two-tail).
Results
The characteristics of the 61 entered patients, the number of
chemotherapy cycles, the dose intensity and total dose of
chemotherapy in the different treatment groups are depicted
in Table I. Two groups of patients who received c.i. GM-CSF
(group A and group B) and the group of patients who
received s.c. GM-CSF (group C) were available for analysis
of the effects of GM-CSF. Data on the comparison between
cycles without and with GM-CSF have been published
elsewhere (Hoekman et al., 1991a).
Table II shows the treatment regimens and the median
nadir of neutrophils and platelets and the median duration of
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in the different groups
per cycle. There was no difference in neutrophil nadir or
neutrophil recovery to a value of >2 x 109 1-' (Table I,
Figure 1). For every cycle mean platelet values were lower in
the c.i group. This difference became greater as more cycles
were given (Table I, Figure 2). Platelet counts < 10 x 109 I-'
were observed on 11 and 22 occasions during 58 c.i. cycles
and 256 s.c. cycles respectively (P=0.04).
Erythrocyte transfusions and platelet transfusions were
given mainly in later cycles (Table II). Erythrocyte
transfusions were necessary in all patients with c.i. GM-
CSF vs 33/47 (70%) patients with s.c. GM-CSF (P=0.02),
and in 41/58 (70%) cycles with c.i. GM-CSF vs 80/256 (31%)
cycles with s.c. GM-CSF (P<0.0001). Platelet transfusions
were given in 10/14 (71%) patients with c.i. GM-CSF vs 20/
47 (43%) patients with s.c. GM-CSF (P=0.07), and in 12/58
(21%) cycles with c.i. GM-CSF vs 24/256 (9%) cycles with
s.c. GM-CSF (P=0.02).
Comparative data for non-haematological toxicity are
shown in Table III. Hospital admission because of toxicity
was necessary in 10/14 (71%) c.i. GM-CSF patients vs 20/47
(43%) s.c. GM-CSF patients (P=0.03), and in 20/58 (34%)
c.i. cycles vs 38/256 (15%) s.c. cycles (P=0.0005). Despite this,
there was no difference in treatment delay or discontinuation
of therapy because of toxicity between the c.i. and s.c. GM-
CSF groups. Treatment delay occurred in 6/14 (42%) c.i.
patients vs 20/47 (43%) s.c. patients (P>0.9), and in 8/58
(14%) c.i. GM-CSF cycles vs 27/256 (11%) s.c. cycles
(P= 0.49). Treatment was discontinued in 4/14 (29%) c.i.
GM-CSF patients vs 7/47 (15%) s.c. GM-CSF patients
(P= 0.25).
Response rates were comparable. Twelve out of 14 (86%)
patients in the c.i. GM-CSF group and 43/47 (91%) patient
in the s.c. GM-CSF group showed a complete or partial
response (P= 0.61).
Discussion
This study, although not randomised, indicates that c.i. GM-
CSF is more toxic in several respects compared with s.c. GM-
CSF. Erythrocyte and platelet transfusions were needed more
often with c.i. GM-CSF and there was a significant difference
in deterioration of the performance status of the patients.
Both routes of administration of GM-CSF were equally
effective as far as recovery of neutrophils is concerned. Mean

platelet values were lower in the group receiving c.i. GM-
CSF, and there was a trend for more platelet transfusions,
although this did not reach significance. We did not change
the policy of platelet transfusion during the study. The effect
of GM-CSF on platelet counts has varied in reported studies
from no effects (Brandt et al., 1988; Groopman et al., 1987;
Antin et al., 1988) to an increase in recovery of platelets
(Vadhan-Raj et al., 1987, 1988). GM-CSF might induce the
production of interleukin-6 (De Vries et al., 1991), which can
stimulate thrombopoiesis (Hill, 1990). Maybe with the s.c.
administration this is more pronounced, because GM-CSF is
injected into the skin, where accessory cells bearing GM-CSF
receptors are present. These cells could then be responsible
for the generation of secondary cytokines, such as
interleukin-6, which can in part compensate for the
suppression of thrombopoiesis.
Erythrocyte infusions were also required more often in the
c.i. GM-CSF group. Indications for blood transfusions did
not change during the study. A cumulative anaemia has been
previously described during the use of GM-CSF (Ardizzoni et
al., 1994; O'Shaugnessy et al., 1994; Suderland, 1991), but
this marked difference in transfusion requirement has not
been reported before. A probable explanation could be that
tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which is an inhibitor of
erythropoiesis (Rusten, 1995) and whose production is
stimulated by GM-CSF (Sisson, 1988) is released for a
prolonged period or in higher concentrations when GM-CSF
is administered by the c.i. route.
Neutropenic fever judged to require intravenous antibio-
tics occurred more often in the group receiving c.i. GM-CSF.
A possible explanation can be that our ability to discern
whether fever was due to infection or to GM-CSF improved
as the study progressed. Another explanation may be the
presence of the Port-A-Cath, although the percentage of
patients with a positive blood culture was not different
between the two groups.
Various other non-haematological side-effects were ob-
served. In three out of 14 patients who received c.i. GM-CSF a
subclavian vein thrombosis developed. This complication has
been described by others as well (Antman et al., 1988), and
probably results from the release ofTNF, which is an initiator of
the coagulation cascade (Nawroth, 1986). There was a notice-
able difference in the incidence ofstomatitis which was worse in
the c.i. GM-CSF group. This occurred despite the fact that there
were no significant differences in neutrophil nadir and duration
of neutropenia, which usually parallels the course of stomatitis
(Lockhart, 1979). Liver enzyme disturbances were equal in both
groups. It seems that this side-effect is correlated with the dose
and not with the route ofadministration ofGM-CSF (Cebon et
al., 1992). Erythematous reactions at injection sites have been
described in several patients using s.c. GM-CSF (Lieschke et al.,
1989). In our group it was recorded in 38% of patients. The
symptoms could generally be relieved with antihistamines.
Earlier we reported on thyroid dysfunction during c.i. GM-
CSF treatment in two patients with pre-existing thyroid
antibodies (Hoekman et al., 1991b). In our subsequent patients
with s.c. GM-CSF we did not observe this phenomenon.
General weakness resulting in a decline in performance
status was significantly worse in patients receiving c.i. GM-
CSF. The reason is unclear. It is known that the side-effects of
GM-CSF are in part mediated by the release of secondary
cytokines such as TNF and interleukin-6 (De Vries et al., 1991;
Stehle et al., 1990). The efficacy ofGM-CSF seems to correlate
with the duration for which serum levels are maintained above
1 ng ml-' (Cebon et al., 1988). It is not known if this is also
true for the side-effects. For s.c. administration serum levels
>1 ng ml-' are achieved for approximately 16 h (Lieschke et
al., 1990). For c.i. administration pharmacokinetics are not
well known but when adequate doses are used there may be a
continuous level above 1 ng ml-'.
GM-CSF administered by c.i. is still used on several
occasions (Bishop et al., 1994; Gordon et al., 1994). There are
situations where the s.c. administration is not attractive, for
instance during prolonged and severe thrombocytopenia, but
one should bear in mind that c.i. GM-CSF is accompanied
by more side-effects. In our study there was no significant
difference in treatment delay or in discontinuation of therapy
between patients receiving c.i. GM-CSF or s.c. GM-CSF.
One can imagine, however, that with such a difference in
toxicity profile c.i. GM-CSF might have a negative effect on
the delivered chemotherapy dose intensity, which seems to be
an important determinant of the outcome in several clinical
situations.
This study indicates that the s.c. route of administration of
GM-CSF is to be preferred over the c.i. route. These results
warrant further study in a randomised trial.
