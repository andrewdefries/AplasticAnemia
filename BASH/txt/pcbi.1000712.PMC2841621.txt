Abstract
In host and cancer tissues, drug metabolism and susceptibility to drugs vary in a circadian (24 h) manner. In particular, the
efficacy of a cell cycle specific (CCS) cytotoxic agent is affected by the daily modulation of cell cycle activity in the target
tissues. Anti-cancer chronotherapy, in which treatments are administered at a particular time each day, aims at exploiting
these biological rhythms to reduce toxicity and improve efficacy of the treatment. The circadian status, which is the timing
of physiological and behavioral activity relative to daily environmental cues, largely determines the best timing of
treatments. However, the influence of variations in tumor kinetics has not been considered in determining appropriate
treatment schedules. We used a simple model for cell populations under chronomodulated treatment to identify which
biological parameters are important for the successful design of a chronotherapy strategy. We show that the duration of the
phase of the cell cycle targeted by the treatment and the cell proliferation rate are crucial in determining the best times to
administer CCS drugs. Thus, optimal treatment times depend not only on the circadian status of the patient but also on the
cell cycle kinetics of the tumor. Then, we developed a theoretical analysis of treatment outcome (TATO) to relate the
circadian status and cell cycle kinetic parameters to the treatment outcomes. We show that the best and the worst CCS drug
administration schedules are those with 24 h intervals, implying that 24 h chronomodulated treatments can be ineffective
or even harmful if administered at wrong circadian times. We show that for certain tumors, administration times at intervals
different from 24 h may reduce these risks without compromising overall efficacy.

Introduction
Neurons located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the
hypothalamus form a dominant circadian pacemaker that
controls timing of many physiological processes, including cell
cycle. The pacemaker integrates environmental cues and
communicates timing information to peripheral organs, which
respond appropriately to optimize their functions [1]. In host and
cancer tissues, drug metabolism and susceptibility to the drug vary
throughout the day. The characterization of daily rhythms in
drug toxicity and efficacy was a foundation for the chronotherapy
of cancer [2].
The main aim of anti-cancer chronomodulated treatment is to
achieve an optimal balance between chronotolerance and
chronoefficacy (drug tolerance and efficacy as a function of time
of administration). However, because many circadian-dependent
factors influence the outcome of a treatment, determining the
optimal schedule has been difficult to implement in clinics [3].
Cytotoxic chemotherapy suppresses the hematopoietic system, and
neutropenia is a major limitation to the doses of drug that can be
tolerated. Therapeutic advantages of chronomodulated treatments
are seen mainly in the tolerance to higher drug doses, along with a
decreased severity of side-effects, rather than in the prolonged
survival of the patients [4,5].
The efficacy of a cytotoxic drug, at a given concentration, is
given by the product between the fraction of cells sensitive to the
drug and the fraction of sensitive cells killed by the drug. For cell
cycle phase specific (CCS) drugs used in chronotherapy, the
fraction of sensitive cells is defined by their cell cycle status (e.g.
fraction of cells in S or M phase) [6]. The entry to S phase is
induced by c-MYC and cyclin D1, and the entry to M phase is gated
(blocked) by WEE1 [7,8]. Since those genes are controlled by the
circadian clock, the cell cycle status is determined by the time of
the day as well. Thus, drugs like cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
(S phase specific), docetaxel (M phase specific) and selicilib (G1
phase specific) would each be expected to have maximal efficacy
and minimal toxicity at different times of the day.
Synchronization properties of the cell cycle to signals from the
circadian pacemaker, namely phases and amplitudes, are tissue-
specific. Blood cell progenitors [9], tongue epithelium [10], and
cancer tissues [11] show tissue-specific daily variation in their
DNA synthesis activity. In tumors, the response is perturbed and
advanced-stage cancer cells can escape or even disrupt circadian
control [12,13]. Therefore, we would expect that the development

of a cell cycle phase specific cancer chronotherapy strategy would
depend on at least three circadian-dependent factors.
1. The circadian time of the patient, which defines the overall timing
of physiological and behavioral activity relative to the daily
environmental cues. There is a wide variation among
individuals in the timing of their activity, and this is linked to
the period length of the circadian pacemaker [14]. Isolated
human fibroblasts display up to 4 h difference in the timing of
the largest concentration of circadian proteins [15].
2. The circadian status of the host and the tumor, which defines how
each cell type differs in its response to the circadian time of the
patient. This is tissue-specific and defines the phases and
amplitudes of the cellular activity in each tissue relative to the
circadian pacemaker [16].
3. The cycling status of the host and tumor cells, which defines how
cell cycle kinetic parameters differ between cell types, and how
the circadian clock synchronizes the cell cycle. Because of
variations in cell division times, this property is cell specific.
Heterogeneity in tumor cell cycle kinetics also decreases the
coherence of the circadian response. Together with the
circadian status of the cells and the patient, the cycling status
determines the daily peaks in DNA synthesis and cell division
in the target tissues.
Here, we use a simple model of cell populations under circadian
clock control and chronomodulated treatment to identify which
biological parameters are important for the successful design of a
chronotherapy strategy. We show that optimal CCS drug
administration schedules, which minimize the sensitive fraction
of the host cells and maximize the sensitive fraction of the tumor
cells, are separated by 24 h intervals. However, if timing is wrong,
a daily chronomodulated treatment schedule can lead to the worst
therapeutic outcome as well. Using a theoretical analysis of
treatment outcome (TATO), we show that clinically measurable
cell cycle kinetics parameters are crucial in determining the
response to CCS drugs. We show that chronomodulated
treatments can be beneficial if tailored for individual patients,
but can also be ineffective or even harmful if administered at
wrong circadian times. We show that for fast growing tumors,
administration times at intervals longer than 24 h may reduce
these risks while maintaining a good overall efficacy.
Results
Numerical simulations of the behavior of the system with
and without treatment
Renewing tissues have daily peaks in the fraction of cells in S
phase [9–11]. To explore the influence of daily modulations of cell
cycle kinetics on cell proliferation, we used a simple cell population
model [17–19] (Figure 1). The cell population is divided into four
phases: G0/G1, S, G2 and M. G1 phase has a variable duration
controlled by the transition rate b(t) and S, G2 and M phases have
a fixed duration t(t)~tSztP(t)ztM. The circadian clock
controls the G1-S phase transition and the G2 phase duration:
the G1-S phase transition rate b(t) and the G2 phase duration
tP(t) are 24 h periodic functions (see Methods for a more detailed
description).
We simulated time courses over 48 h for cell populations with
different cell cycle phenotypes: host cells, tumor cells with a short
S phase duration (fast growing tumors), and tumor cells with a
long S phase duration (slow growing tumors). Because G1 phase
has a variable duration (represented by an exponential distribu-
tion of times with parameter b), cells tend to desynchronize when
there are no synchronization factors present. Even when cells are
initially synchronized, once the clock control is off (a1~0), the
fractions in each phase of the cell cycle reach a steady state within
a few division cycles (asynchronous cell growth). While the clock
control is on (a1w0), all populations, irrespective of their cell
cycle length, show a circadian variation in the fraction of cells
G1, S, G2 and M phases (Figure 2). The fraction of host cells in S
phase varies from 20% to 30%, and peaks around 12:00 every
day (Figure 2A, solid line). The fractions of tumor cells in S phase
vary between 15% and 30% for fast growing tumors and between
42% and 47% for slow growing tumors, and they peak at
different times (Figure 2A, dashed and dashed-dotted lines
respectively). The fractions of cells in G1 and G2/M phases also
peak at different times of the day and their amplitudes are
different for each phase (Figure 2B, C). These results indicate that
the fractions in each cell cycle phase match the circadian period
but the time at which they peak is influenced by the cell cycle
status (tumor and host cells respond with different strength to the
external cues).
S phase fractions in the host and tumor populations peak at
different times, a feature that could be exploited by a well-timed
administration of an S phase specific drug. We simulated the effect
of one course of treatment based on a standard protocol (see
Methods). We compared two tumor cell phenotypes: a fast
growing tumor (Figure 3A,B) and a slow growing tumor
(Figure 3C,D). Cell cycle kinetic parameters for the host and
tumor cells were estimated from experimental data in patients
when available; otherwise, data from mice were used. We assumed
that the circadian clock acts at the same time of the day in the host
and tumor cells, albeit more strongly on the host cells. To
determine the optimal treatment time, we defined an outcome
function E that measures the trade-off between anti-tumor efficacy
and toxicity. We calculated the outcome of treatments given at
different circadian times. The optimal treatment time for the fast
and slow growing tumors is during night. However, the worst
times of treatments are different: 17:30 for the fast growing tumor
and 5:00 for the slow growing tumor (Figure 3B,D). This shows
that the S phase duration alone can strongly affect the outcome of
a chronomodulated treatment.
Author Summary
Chronotherapy of cancers aims at exploiting daily physi-
ological rhythms to improve anti-cancer efficacy and
tolerance to drugs by administering treatments at a
specific time of the day. Recent clinical trials have shown
that chronotherapy can be beneficial in improving quality
of life and median life span in patients, but that it can also
have negative effects if the timing is wrong. A theoretical
basis for the rational development of individualized
therapy schedules is still lacking. Here, we use a simple
cell population model to show how biological rhythms
and the cell cycle interact to modulate the response to
cancer therapy. In particular, we show that the prolifera-
tion rate of cancer cells determines when treatments are
most effective. We provide a simple formulation of the
problem that can be used to compute an objective
response function based on the drug sensitivity and the
proliferation rate of tumor cells. Finally, we show that in
some cases, treating at a different time every day may be
more appropriate than standard daily chronotherapy.
These results constitute an important step in designing
individualized chronotherapy treatments, and point out to
ways to design better clinical trials.

Theoretical analysis of the treatment outcomes (TATO)
The fraction of cells in each cell cycle phase determines how
sensitive to treatment tissues are. Therefore, it would be useful to
predict the best time of treatment based on kinetic data without
having to run full simulations. We developed a theoretical method,
TATO, to predict the influence of cell kinetics on CCS drug
toxicity and efficacy. If the G1-S phase transition rate b (due to
circadian entrainment) and the surviving fraction s (due to the
treatment) are 24 h-periodic, we can solve the periodic treatment
problem by calculating the average host and tumor population
growth rates under 24 h period perturbations. The contribution of
the rhythmic entrainment of the cell cycle to the growth rate can
be approximated by

which is the average of the product between the two terms, is the
net contribution of the periodic component to the rate of viable
newborn cells over 24 h. As a function of w, the sign of the integral
determines the effect (positive or negative) of the clock and the
treatment on the growth rate. We found that the integrals fC and
fH are good approximations of the response values RC and RH
computed by numerical simulation (Figure 4).
The functions fC and fH , as approximations of response
functions RC and RH , are useful to study the dependence of the
treatment outcomes on the cell cycle kinetic parameters. For drugs
targeting the S phase, three cell cycle parameters affect the
periodic part of the growth rate: (1) the duration of the S phase tS,
(2) the timing of the peak of the G1-S phase transition rate h, and
(3) the timing of the cell death rate, given by the timing of the drug

administration w. These parameters appear, explicitly or implic-
itly, in Eq. 1. The extrema of Eq. 1, which represent the largest
and the smallest growth rates of the cell population, can be located
when b and s are known. As a first approximation, when the
death rate c(t) and the G1-S phase transition rate b(t) are
sinusoidal and are largest at times w and h, the location of the
extrema can be calculated explicitly. The maximum of fi occurs
when
wmax~tS=2z12zh mod 24
and the minimum of fi occurs when
wmin~tS=2zh mod 24:
(Figure 4A, white lines). Therefore, to kill the largest fraction of
cells, i.e. to minimize f , treatments should be applied halfway the
S phase duration after the daily peak in G1-S phase transition. To
spare the largest fraction of cells, the treatment should be applied
12 h later (detailed analysis in Methods). Based only on tS and h,
TATO predicts that the extrema of f are 12 h apart. This
approximation is good for tS durations between 7 h and 24 h
(Figure 4B). When tS is larger than 24 h, the extrema are shifted
by 12 h (Figure 4). When tS~24 h, the timing of the treatment
has no effect.
Anticancer drugs interfering with DNA synthesis (S phase) are
widely used, but other phases of the cell cycle can be targeted as
well. Therefore, in addition to the simulations for drug specific to S
phase, we ran full model simulations for drugs acting on G1 or
G2/M phase and compared the outcome to prediction from
TATO (Table 1). The treatment protocol was the same as for the
S phase drug, which is also included in Table 1. Optimal times of
treatment in G1, S and G2/M phases vary by as much as 9 h
between fast and slow growing tumors (formulas for optimal times
are given in Methods). The worst times of treatment also show
large differences between fast and slow growing tumors. Despite
this, TATO predicts the optimal time within 2.5 h.
Taken together, these results indicate that TATO, using only a
reduced set of kinetic parameters, can reliably predict the outcome
of full simulations.
Comparison of different chronomodulated designs
Previous computational studies have found that the fraction of
cells killed with a constant drug infusion is higher (more toxic) than
that killed with a chronomodulated infusion, for the same average
killing rate [20–23]. Our model is consistent with these findings,
and indicates that higher total doses of chronomodulated drug can
be tolerated and are needed to achieve the same anti-tumor
efficacy. These theoretical results are in agreement with clinical
trials that showed consistent higher tolerance for chronomodulated
compared to constant infusion [4], even when given at non-
optimal times [24]. Lesser toxicity is independent from the
circadian rhythms, i.e. chronomodulated treatments are less toxic
even in absence of circadian rhythms a1~0. Thus, clinical and
theoretical evidence shows that the shape of the infusion profile
alone affects the treatment outcome significantly. For that reason,
a direct comparison between constant and chronomodulated
treatment is not really possible. Instead, we asked whether the
same drug concentration profile administered at intervals different
from 24 h could improve efficacy.
We simulated the chronomodulated administration protocol
with intervals ranging from p~16 to p~30 h, starting on the first
day at a time t0 between 0:00 and 24:00. The total quantity and
the infusion profile of the drug administered was the same for all
intervals tested. Therefore, the resulting difference between
outcomes depends only on the initial timing t0 and the period p.
As expected, the largest amplitude of outcomes as a function of t0,
and the best outcomes globally, are at intervals p~24 h
(Figure 5A–D, solid lines). Likewise, the worst treatment outcomes
also occur at intervals of 24 h.
To avoid the worst outcomes, it may be safer to seek treatment
intervals that minimize outcome amplitudes, while optimizing the
average outcome (maximizing E). When p is close to 24 h, the
treatment times can be averaged over the treatment course and
TATO predicts an outcome given by
t0(p)~w24{(p{24)
m{1
2
, ð2Þ
where m is the number of drug administrations during one course
of treatment, and w24 is the phase of a 24 h interval treatment. If p
is larger than 24 h, the starting time of treatment t0 needs to be
advanced to produce an outcome equivalent to the one obtained
at w24. Here, using m~5, each hour increment in p leads to a 2 h-
advance in the starting treatment time. When p is much different
from 24 h, i.e. p~24n=m, n~m+1, the average treatment phase
is undefined, and TATO predicts an outcome independent from
t0. In both fast and slow growing tumors, at these values p~19:2 h
and p~28:8 h, the outcome E depends little on t0. These two
intervals offer circadian-independent treatment controls for the
chronomodulated treatment (Figure 5B,D dashed and dotted
lines). For a 24 h interval treatment to be safe to use, the time
window during which the treatment is better than control should
be large. TATO predicts that the outcome at p~19:2 h and
p~28:8 h depends significantly on the duration of the sensitive
phase (Eq. 24 in Methods). Treatment intervals longer than 24 h
are predicted to spare the most host and slow growing tumor cells
while shorter intervals are expected to spare the most fast tumor
cells. Numerical simulations confirmed that the outcomes depend
on the intervals in a way that is specific to the tumor. Fast growing
tumors showed the best response at intervals p~28:8 h except for
a small time window around midnight (Figure 5B), while the slow
growing tumors showed a better response at p~24 h (Figure 5D).
Differences in the cell cycle lengths between the tumor and host
cells could be exploited by adapting the interval between drug
administrations [25,26]. Cell cycle length effects were also
observed in the model in the presence of the circadian clock.
Overall, a long interval tended to improve anti-tumor efficacy in
fast growing tumors, while a short interval was detrimental

(Figure 5A). The opposite was observed for slow growing tumors,
where shorter treatment intervals had a better outcome
(Figure 5C). This indicates that the cell cycle kinetics interacts
with the timing of the drug administration to modulate outcomes,
even in the presence of a circadian clock.
Discussion
Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated significant
improvements in tolerability and antitumor efficacy of chemo-
therapy with standardized chronomodulated administrations in
comparison with a constant rate infusion of chemotherapy [27] or
a chronomodulated delivery with an opposite timing [28,29].
However, these studies did not show any survival benefit. In a
recent large trial involving colorectal cancer patients, standardized
chronotherapy achieved significantly better survival as compared
to conventional treatment in men, but not in women [30]. This
indicates that the response of patients to standardized chrono-
therapy can be heterogeneous, and that there is a need for
tailoring delivery pattern to an individual patient or to subgroups
of patients with distinct chronotherapeutic determinants.
These determinants are structured in different levels: whole
body/systemic, target tissues, and cellular levels. A combination of
these three factors contributes to the therapeutic advantage of
chronomodulated delivery in an individual patient, and to the best
delivery time. Systemic level includes the main behavioral and
physiological characteristics like sleep/wake and eating patterns.
The phase difference in peak expression of clock genes of each
chronotype indicates that the optimal treatment time could vary at
least by +2 h [15]. For example, the efficacy and toxicity of 5-FU
are dependent on thymidylate synthase (TS) activity, its molecular
target [31,32], and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase activity
(DPD), the enzyme responsible for the elimination of 5-FU [33].
Circadian rhythms in both TS and DPD activity have been

detected [34,35]. TS activity is higher during S, G2 and M phases,
therefore the rhythms might be due to cell cycle synchronization
[36,37], or to direct circadian clock control. Also, circadian
rhythms in DPD activity modulate 5-FU concentration during the
day, regardless of whether 5-FU delivery is constant or
chronomodulated.
In this study, we showed how cell cycle kinetics, i.e. cell cycle
length and duration of the susceptible phase, can affect the timing
of the optimal chronomodulated treatment. We used a mathe-
matical model for normal cell and tumor growth under circadian
regulation to investigate: (i) how we can use differences of cell cycle
dynamics between host and tumor cells to establish an optimal
treatment schedule, and (ii) how timing of the best and the worst
treatment outcomes depends on individual chronotype and the
growth rate of the tumor.
Optimization of treatment schedules based on cell cycle kinetics
of target tissues has been explored before [26,38]. These
experimental and theoretical studies were based on the concept
of resonance therapy, where treating at integer multiples of the cell
cycle length leads to a reduction of killing of normal cells. This
could be exploited in cancers where tumors cells have a cell cycle
time distinct from normal cells, or where there is a large variability
in tumor cell cycle times. It was noted, however, that heterogeneity
in normal cell cycle times reduces the benefits of resonance
therapy [25]. These alternative schedules have so far received little
attention in the context of chronotherapy.
Recently, Altinok et al. [39] used a computational approach
based on cellular automata to explore the effect of the variability in
the cell cycle length on chronotolerance and chronoefficacy of 5-
FU and oxaliplatin. Their model accounted for the observation
that the toxicity profiles of 5-FU and oxaliplatin are antiphase, and
showed how variability in cell cycle lengths reduces the benefits of
chronomodulated treatments. Cell populations with cell cycle
times just below 24 h are most likely to benefit from chronother-
apy, a result that could be explained by a synergy between cell
cycle times, circadian rhythms and periodic treatments.
Importance of the tumor growth rate
We have developed an analytic method, TATO, that allows us
to identify the optimal treatment time based on the circadian
status and on the cell cycle kinetics of the host and tumor tissues.
TATO measures the average differential growth rate of host and
tumor cells that is caused by the circadian modulation of the cell
cycle. Three parameters are essential to calculate the differential
growth rate: the G1/S phase transition rate, the duration of the
drug susceptibility phase, and the death rate. Our model indicates
that the cell cycle length, which can vary from 18 h to over 100 h
in colorectal cancers [40], is important to determine the best
treatment times and intervals.
24 h interval treatments at the right time provided the best
efficacy. Yet, the worse time of treatment can be as near as few
hours from the optimal time [41], making it risky to treat at 24 h
intervals. A previous study has found a significant correlation
between S phase duration and 5-FU sensitivity [36]. Here we
showed that for fast growing tumor (short S phase duration),
administering a drug that targets the S phase of the cell cycle at
28.8 h intervals may be safer than treating at 24 h intervals.
However, we found that for slow growing tumor (long S phase
duration), treating at 24 h intervals was indeed the best option,
even when deviating from the optimal time. So far, schedules
different from 24 h have not been tested in the context of
circadian chronotherapy, but in this paper, we show that for fast
growing tumors they might be a safer strategy.
Quantitative approach to chronotherapy in a clinical
setting
Drugs and the active drug metabolites used in chronotherapy
are rapidly eliminated after delivery, which causes large modula-
tions in their concentrations during the day. For that reason,
patients with decreased 5-FU clearance rate due to a partial or
complete loss of DPD activity might not benefit from chronomo-
dulated treatments. An observed lower mean and amplitude of
DPD activity in women is a possible explanation for the lower
survival time with chronotherapy [5].
Here, we suggest how to individualize chronomodulated
treatment schedules. First, patients with no overt circadian rhythm
perturbations need to be selected, and their tumor kinetics assesed
by measuring the S phase duration (tS) and potential doubling
time (tpot). If the S phase duration of the tumor cells is short, a non-
24 h schedule may be preferable. If the S phase duration of the
tumor cells is long, a 24 h schedule could be more effective.
Second, the best treatment time could be determined using
TATO. Constant infusion is not the best control for 24 h
schedules since the shape of the infusion profile is likely to have
a significant effect on outcomes [3]. Chronomodulated treatments
with intervals spanning the whole day equally allows minimizing
circadian effects, thus they could make suitable controls. Unlike for
24 h schedules, a constant infusion control group could be used to
assess the efficacy of non 24 h interval treatments.
Third, once the optimal treatment time is determined, reverse
pharmacokinetics could be used to retrieve the corresponding dose
delivery schedule. Given a fixed dose d delivered to a tissue at time
t, the fraction of surviving cells depends on the fraction of sensitive
cells and the killing rate. If the killing rate varies in a predictable
way during the day due to metabolism or elimination, it is possible
to find a normalization dosage profile d(t) to make the killing rate
time-independent. Thus, by knowing the quantity of drug needed
to achieve a given killing rate, the fraction of surviving cells can be
determined by the fraction of sensitive cells given by the model
presented here.
The accepted administration time for 5-FU, 4:00, is based on the
observation that in mice, the maximal tolerance is reached 5 h after
light onset, corresponding to 5 h after beginning sleeping at 23:00 in
humans [4]. In a recent study [28], 8 groups of patients received
chronomodulated 5-FU-LV with peak times staggered every 3 h.
Toxicity showed a marked circadian dependency of timing of
chronomodulated 5-FU with leucovorin and oxaliplatin or
carboplatin in cancer patients, with optimal time of 5-FU in cancer
patients near 4:00 with 90% confidence limits. This study also
showed more toxicity and large variability in women. Chronomo-
dulated drug infusion differs in two respects from constant rate
infusion: modulated concentration profile and timing. Chronother-
apy is based on adapting the timing of treatment regimens to the
circadian rhythms [27]. Thus, for the chronotherapy principle to
work once the effect of concentration profile is discounted, there
should be a 12 h time window during which the therapeutic
outcome improves. This means that only 6 h would separate the
optimal treatment time and a no-effect treatment time. We
conclude that for chronotherapy clinical trials, patients need to be
grouped according to the chronotype, tumor growth kinetics and
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics characteristics.
Methods
Population model of cell proliferation with circadian
control
The cell population is divided into four phases: G0/G1, S, G2 and
M. The G0/G1 phase includes cells that are actively dividing, but are

in the pre-DNA synthesis or growth phase (G1) and cells that are
quiescent but can be recruited to the cell cycle (G0). The S phase
includes cells in DNA synthesis. The G2 and M phases include cells
that have synthesized DNA and are progressing through mitosis. We
used a population model of cell proliferation [17–19] in which we
introduced a circadian control (Figure 1). Each stage of the cell cycle
and its relationship to the circadian clock is modeled. The input to the
model is a treatment course and the output is the population size in
each cell cycle phase at any given time of the day.
We consider two cell types, host and tumor cells. Cell kinetic
parameters for the host correspond to blood cell progenitors and
for the tumor, to colorectal cancer cells. The model tracks the total
cell number and fraction of cells in each phase for host and tumor
during a course of chemotherapy, allowing estimates of efficacy
and toxicity. The equations for the cell populations are

Each equation represents the balance between fluxes of cells

the G2 phase cell number, and M (Eq. 6) is the M phase cell
number. The total cell number is denoted Tot~NzSzPzM.
The term s(t), 0ƒsƒ1, is the fraction of cells surviving the cell

uals affect these parameters.

The population model is linear and simulations of host and
tumor cell growth show that their cell numbers grow exponentially
with a circadian modulation. Here we neglect nonlinear terms that
would eventually cause the cell number to stabilize. We assume
that with the treatment, the cell number is far from equilibrium.
For a small-size tumor, this is a reasonable assumption. We also
neglect the systemic feedback mechanisms of normal tissue
homeostasis, which are more relevant to study between courses
of chemotherapy when patients are recovering. Therefore, a linear
model is also considered for the host tissues under cytotoxic stress.
Simulation of different treatment schedules
We simulate a colorectal cancer treatment with 5-FU [42,43]. 5-FU
is an S phase specific drug that inhibits thymidylate synthase activity
required for DNA synthesis, and consequently induces cell death.
Chemotherapy schedules used clinically are either chronomodulated at
24 h intervals, or a constant infusion of 5-FU for a few consecutive
days. The treatment is repeated every two to three weeks [4].
For simplicity, we simulate only one course of chemotherapy.
We consider three different schedules: chronomodulated with 24 h
intervals, flat infusion, and chronomodulated with intervals
different from 24 h. One course of treatment lasts 5 days or 5
chronomodulated administrations. To isolate the effect of
chronomodulation of treatment, we ignore the pharmacodynam-
ics/pharmacokinetics aspects and we assume that chemotherapy
acts on tumor and host cells in the same way. Because cytotoxic
chemotherapy affects the hematopoietic system, and neutropenia
is a major limitation to drug tolerance, we simulate the effect of 5-
FU with blood cells as the host tissue.
The effect of 5-FU is simulated by adding a drug-induced death
rate to the basal apoptosis rate of S-phase cells,

Measure of treatment outcomes
The treatment outcome measure is defined as
E(w)~ log
exp (RH (w))z exp ({RC(w))

 
, ð16Þ
where the functions RC and RH measure the cytotoxicity in tumor
(C) and host (H) cells. The parameter w is the circadian time of
drug administration in case of a 24 h treatment interval. For non-
24 h intervals, it is the time of administration on the first day of
treatment. RC and RH , obtained from numerical simulations, are
the normalized cell numbers 7 days after the first day of treatment
R~(Tot{mean(Tot))=( max (Tot){ min (Tot)), where Tot is
the total cell number as a function of w. The outcome function E
must increase with RH (high tolerance) and decreases with RC
(high killing rate). For the flat infusions, E is constant. Close to
zero, a Taylor expansion gives
E(w)*

The outcome E measures the difference between responses RH and
RC, and penalizes both excessive toxicity and poor anti-tumor efficacy.
An optimal treatment maximizing tumor cell kill and minimizing host
cell loss is found by maximizing the outcome function E.
Theoretical analysis of treatment outcomes (TATO)
Equation 3 does not depend on other dynamical variables, so its
stability analysis is simplified. Assuming a exponential growth,
N(t)*C(t) exp (st), where C(t) is a T = 24 h-periodic function
and s is the growth rate, we have from Eq. 3,
dC(t)

The integral can be either positive or negative, modulating the
growth rate accordingly. As a consequence, the growth rate
(tolerance) is maximal when the integral is maximal and the death
rate (toxicity) maximal when the integral is minimal.
We consider b(t)~b0(1z cos (2p(t{h)=T)) and a drug
specific to the S phase cS(t,w)~c0(1z cos (2p(t{w)=T)). Then,
1. The integral is maximal at wmax~tS=2z12zh mod 24.
2. The integral is minimal at wmin~tS=2zh mod 24.
3. The amplitude of the integral, I(wmax){I(wmin)~m(tS)
exp ({c0tS), where the function m is a symmetric function
on 0–24 h, m(0)~m(24)~0 and the value tS that maximizes
m is tS~12 h.
The values wmax and wmin are shifted 12 h when tS§24 h. If
the drug acts on the G2/M phases, with cG2=M(t,w)~
c0(1z cos (2p(t{w)=T)) then
1. The integral is maximal at wmax~tG2=M=2ztSz12z

2. The integral is minimal at wmin~tG2=M=2ztSzh mod 24.
For cell death occurring in the G1 phase, the death rate d(t) is
chronomodulated. We assume that s is constant and therefore, the
integral term becomes

If d(t) peaks at w, meaning many cells in G1 are lost, the periodic
solution C(t) will reach a minimum value at w. Thus the ratio
C(t{t)=C(t) will have a maximum at t~w and a minimum
at t~wzt mod T. Assuming that b(t{t) peaks at
t~hzt mod T and is minimum at t~hztz12 mod T,
1. The integral is maximal between hzt and hz12 mod 24.
2. The integral is minimal between h and hz12zt mod 24.
When treatment intervals are different from 24 h, the outcome will
