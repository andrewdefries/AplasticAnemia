Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC) is a pure red cell aplasia which primarily
affects children in the infant and toddler age group. The clinical syndrome of TEC is well defined
and is characterized by moderate to severe anemia with reticulocytopenia, selective aplasia of the
erythroid bone marrow elements, and spontaneous recovery, usually within a month of presenta-
tion. We utilized the plasma clot tissue culture technique to explore the defect of erythropoiesis in
seven patients with TEC. Culture of bone marrow at diagnosis in four patients revealed an
increased erythroid proliferative capacity in one and a decreased capacity in three. The former
patient plus three additional patients were found to have a transient serum inhibitor of erythroid
colony formation in autologous and allogeneic systems. The three patients with diminished
erythroid proliferative capacity had no demonstrable serum inhibitor, and in one patient studied
the erythroid proliferative capacity became supernormal after recovery. We conclude that
although TEC has a characteristic clinical picture, in vitro studies reveal a variable expression of
the erythropoietic defect and support the hypothesis of a heterogeneous pathogenesis of this
disorder.
Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC) is a syndrome characterized by
temporary arrest of red cell production resulting in moderate to severe anemia [1-5].
The clinical syndrome is quite uniform with the disease affecting primarily older
infants and toddlers, often with a history of a preceding viral illness. There are usually
no physical findings other than pallor and a hemic murmur. The blood count reveals a
normocytic and normochromic anemia, absent reticulocytes, normal white cell counts,
and normal or elevated platelet counts. Bone marrow examination reveals a selective
red cell aplasia. Complete hematologic recovery occurs without treatment usually
within a month of presentation and recurrences are rare.
The pathogenesis of this fascinating disorder has recently been investigated utilizing
clonal assay systems for erythroid stem cell proliferation [6]. Koenig et al. [7] studied
four children with TEC and demonstrated a serum or IgG inhibitor of erythroid colony
growth in all patients. Dessypris et al. [8] found an IgG inhibitor of erythropoiesis in

only eight of 12 patients and noted variability of both colony formation at diagnosis
and site of inhibitor activity. Freedman and Saunders [9] recently investigated four
patients with TEC and concluded that there are at least four mechanisms of erythroid
suppression: (1) IgG inhibition, (2) IgM inhibition, (3) cell-mediated inhibition, and (4)
nonimmune inhibition. Thus, although the clinical picture is quite typical, the stem cell
culture studies are not.
To further document in vitro erythropoiesis in patients with TEC, we studied seven
patients with the syndrome utilizing the plasma clot assay system. We assessed (1) the
proliferation oferythroid colonies at the time ofdiagnosis and recovery, (2) the effect of
adding the patients' sera to their own bone marrow culture, and (3) the effect of the
patients' diagnosis and recovery sera on colony formation from normal control marrow.
Our results indicate the presence of a transient serum inhibitor directed against
erythroid stem cells in some TEC patients, but in a distinct cohort of patients reduced
erythroid proliferation was seen without a demonstrable serum inhibitor. In one patient
studied, this diminished erythroid proliferative capacity returned to normal following
recovery. These studies document variable in vitro erythropoietic expression in patients
with TEC and support the hypothesis of a heterogeneous pathogenesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The clinical characteristics of the seven patients studied are outlined as follows:
There were six boys and one girl ranging in age from 1'A2 to 310/12 years with an average
age of 22/2 years. Three of the seven patients (patients 1, 2, and 7) had a history of a
viral illness in the prior one to two months. Patient 4 was developmentally delayed, had
a seizure disorder, and was taking phenytoin and phenobarbital at the time of
presentation. Of note is the fact that 2'/2 years after the diagnosis of TEC was made in
patient 4, he presented with hypomegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia and has pro-
gressive marrow aplasia. All other patients had received no medication and had an
unremarkable past medical history. The average hemoglobin was 6.4 g/dl with a range
of 4.8-8.3 g/dl. The MCV was normal for age, and reticulocytes were absent in all
cases. White blood counts were within the normal range for all patients, although
patient 3 was found to have neutropenia with an absolute granulocyte count of 700.
Platelet counts were normal in three and elevated in four. The Coombs test was
negative in all patients. Hb F was slightly elevated in two patients (normal <2 percent)
and normal in three. Each bone marrow aspirate revealed isolated erythroid hypoplasia
with a myeloid-to-erythroid ratio .6:1 (normal 2-4:1). Other than red cell transfu-
sions, no treatment was given. Recovery (defined as the first documented reticulocyte
count greater than 2 percent) occurred within three weeks for all patients with an
average of 1 /2weeks. There was no obvious correlation between the time to recovery
and the degree of anemia, marrow erythroid hypoplasia, or percentage of Hb F. There
have been no recurrences of TEC.
Laboratory Methods
Bone marrow cells were obtained by aspiration from the posterior iliac crest in the
patients and 16 normal controls. Bone marrow at diagnosis was obtained from patients
1-4 and at recovery from patient 3. Serum at diagnosis and recovery was obtained
from all patients, although insufficient serum was present to complete all allogeneic

studies in patients 1 and 2. Informed consent was obtained from both patients and
controls. The plasma clot culture technique was used for cloning erythroid colonies as
described by Tepperman et al. [10] except that alpha medium (a-MEM) was
substituted for NCTC 109. Dispersed bone marrow cells were layered over Ficoll-
Hypaque and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C. The mononuclear cell
layer was removed and the cells were washed in supplemented a-MEM + 2 percent
fetal calf serum. Bone marrow cells at a final concentration of 6 x 105/ 1.1 ml were
cultured in quadruplicate in the presence of 2 IU of Step III sheep erythropoietin. In
studies of humoral inhibitors, serum was added to the culture at a final concentration
(v/v) of 10 percent. Cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5 percent
CO2 at 370C. At days 6 and 12, clots were removed and transferred to glass slides, fixed
in glutaraldehyde, and stained with benzidine and hematoxylin. Erythroid colonies of 8
to 49 benzidine-positive cells appearing on day 6 were counted as CFU-E-derived
colonies. Colonies of greater than 50 cells or clusters of three or more CFU-E-derived
colonies appearing on day 12 were counted as BFU-E-derived colonies.
Statistical analysis was performed with the Wilcoxon non-paired rank sum test.
RESULTS
Colony Formation at Diagnosis
Figure 1 shows the number of CFU-E-derived colonies from four patients' bone
marrow cells obtained at diagnosis. In our laboratory, normal donor marrow cells will
produce 58 ± 6 colonies/6 x 104 cells when cultured with 2 IU of erythropoietin.
Patient 1's marrow produced 159 ± 15 colonies/6 x 104 cells, over 2'/2 times the normal
number of colonies. Marrow cultures from patients 2 and 3, on the other hand, formed
significantly fewer CFU-Es than controls, while no CFU-E-derived colonies formed in
cultures of marrow from patient 4. Patient I had 1.25 ± 0.5 BFU-E-derived colonies/
6 x 104 cells at diagnosis while patients 2-4 had none. In the presence of 2 IU of
erythropoietin, BFU-E proliferation in normals in our laboratory varies from 0-7
BFU-E/6 x 104 cells, with an average of 2.5 ± 1.0.

Figure 2 shows the effect of the patient's diagnosis serum and normal control serum
on proliferation of CFU-E-derived colonies by the patient's own (autologous) marrow

inhibited colony formation. Serum from patients 2 and 3 had no effect on colony
growth relative to control serum. Addition of control serum to patient 4's culture
resulted in the appearance of a few colonies, while the patient's own serum increased
colony formation eighteenfold. This latter pattern of stimulation has been observed in
sera of patients with very high serum erythropoietin levels [1 1].
With the addition of 10 percent control serum to patient l's marrow culture, two
BFU-E-derived colonies were formed, while none were present with the addition of the
patient's serum. Patient 2 had two BFU-E colonies with control serum and one with
patient serum. Patients 3 and 4 demonstrated no BFU-E formation with the addition of
control or patient serum.
Effect ofSerum Obtained at Diagnosis on Allogeneic Colony Formation
The effect of diagnosis serum from six of the seven patients on CFU-E colony
proliferation by hematologically normal controls is represented in Fig. 3. Patient l's
serum completely inhibited colony formation, as observed in the autologous system
(see Fig. 2). Serum from patient 3 produced 17 percent inhibition (patient, 35 ± 2
colonies/6 x 104 cells; control, 42 ± 2) and serum from patient 4 produced 17 percent
stimulation (patient, 136 + 16 colonies/6 x 104 cells; control, 116 ± 2), respectively,
when compared to controls. Differences of this magnitude are within the error of the
assay system and are not statistically different at the p < .05 level. These results
confirm the lack of inhibition found in the autologous system. Sera from patients 5, 6,
and 7 inhibited colony formation by 58, 81, and 60 percent, respectively.

The effect ofdiagnosis serum an allogeneic BFU-E proliferation could be assessed in
patients 5 and 6. There was insufficient BFU-E growth for similar assessment in the
other patients. With the addition of patient 5's serum to the culture, only 2 ± 1 BFU-E
were formed compared to 8 ± 1 with the addition of control serum. In another
experiment, addition of serum from patient 6 completely suppressed BFU-E growth,
while with 10 percent control serum 29 ± 2 BFU-Es were counted.
Effect ofSerum Obtained After Recovery on Allogeneic Colony Formation
A comparison of the effect on allogeneic colony proliferation of recovery serum
versus diagnosis serum from the four patients with serum inhibitors is shown in Fig. 4.
Addition of recovery serum from patient 1 (obtained three months after diagnosis) had
no significant effect on CFU-E proliferation when compared to control serum. While
only 17 colonies were formed in the presence of diagnosis serum from patient 5, double
the number was evident with recovery serum (obtained 3'/2 weeks after diagnosis), not
statistically different than control serum (p = 0.486). Early recovery serum from
patient 6 (obtained 11 days after diagnosis) had a minimal effect on colony prolifera-
tion compared to control serum (p = 0.056) and a striking fourfold augmentation
compared to diagnosis serum. Recovery serum from patient 7 (obtained two months
after diagnosis) had a minimal stimulatory effect when compared to control serum and
supported over three times the number of colonies found in cultures containing
diagnosis serum.
The effect of recovery serum on BFU-E colony formation in an allogeneic system
was assessed in three patients. In patient 1, recovery serum had no effect on colony
formation when compared to control serum (7 ± 1 vs. 9 ± 2 BFU-Es). Similar results
were obtained utilizing patient 5's recovery serum (6 ± 1 vs. 8 ± 1 BFU-Es). With the
early recovery serum from patient 6, however, only two BFU-E-derived colonies were
enumerated, compared to 29 colonies with control serum.
Colony Formation After Recovery
One of three patients without evidence of an inhibitor had a bone marrow aspirate
performed after complete hematologic recovery. Six weeks after diagnosis, patient 3
had a normal hemoglobin (11.5 g/dl), a bone marrow with normal erythroid elements,
and a normal M:E ratio of 2.5:1. Figure 5 shows CFU-E-derived colony formation of
this patient's recovery marrow compared to colony growth at diagnosis and to growth

of control marrow cells. While at diagnosis there were only 18 CFU-E-derived
colonies/6 x 104 cells, at recovery CFU-E proliferation increased sevenfold to 128
colonies, twice that of controls. BFU-E-derived colony formation revealed a similar
increase in proliferative capacity, with 19 colonies counted in the culture of recovery
marrow. This is a dramatic increase when compared to the absent growth at diagnosis
and considerably higher than our normal range for BFU-E numbers.
DISCUSSION
Previous studies of patients with TEC utilizing clonal stem cell assays for erythroid
stem cell proliferation have increased our understanding of the mechanism of this
disorder, yet there are inconsistencies in the reported results. Koenig et al. [7]
described the first in vitro studies in patients with TEC. Significant inhibition of
allogeneic CFU-E-derived colony formation occurred with the addition of serum of
IgG from all four patients studied. There was variability, however, of the effect on
BFU-E growth. In the only patient whose own marrow was studied, normal erythroid
colony growth was observed but was abolished by addition of her serum. They
concluded that an immune mechanism suppressing erythroid proliferation is the most
likely cause of the anemia in TEC.
Dessypris et al. [8] studied 12 patients with TEC. Erythroid stem cell proliferation
of the patient's own marrow was studied in nine patients. Five of these patients had
normal colony numbers, but four had decreased numbers. In the five patients with
normal in vitro erythropoiesis, only three could be shown to have serum and
IgG-mediated suppression of colony formation. Of the four patients with diminished
erythroid colonies at diagnosis, no inhibition could be demonstrated in an autologous
system, while IgG from two of the four patients caused suppression of erythropoiesis in
an allogeneic system. IgG from two additional patients studied in an allogeneic system
suppressed BFU-E growth without affecting CFU-E growth. These studies first raised
the question of mechanisms other than immune suppression as the cause of the anemia
in TEC.
Freedman and Saunders [9] reported studies on four children with TEC. Three of
the four had normal erythroid colony formation at diagnosis, while one had low
numbers of CFU-Es and BFU-Es. Of the patients with normal colony formation at
diagnosis, one was found to have a serum and IgG inhibitor, the second had a serum
and IgM inhibitor with no evidence of IgG inhibition, and in the third no inhibitor was
demonstrated. The patient with diminished erythroid capacity at diagnosis had
evidence of cell-mediated inhibition in co-culture studies.

ERYTHROPOIESIS IN TEC
In the present report, variability of in vitro erythropoiesis in seven patients with TEC
is again noted. Only one of four patients studied had normal colony formation at
diagnosis. This patient had clear evidence of serum inhibition of both autologous and
allogeneic CFU-E-derived colony formation. In the three patients with diminished in
vitro erythroid potential at diagnosis, no serum inhibition of colony formation could be
demonstrated. Furthermore, in one of these patients studied after complete recovery,
erythroid proliferative capacity returned to supernormal levels. Three additional
patients whose serum only was studied had evidence of inhibition of erythropoiesis.
Recovery sera from patients with inhibitors showed no evidence of suppression of
colony formation, as noted in the patients studied by the previous authors. BFU-E data
from these studies were more difficult to interpret because of low colony numbers, but
in general coincided with the CFU-E results.
It can be concluded from the foregoing studies that the anemia of TEC in many
cases is mediated by a serum inhibitor directed at the erythroid-committed stem cell.
In most instances, this inhibitor is an IgG immunoglobulin, but, rarely, an IgM
immunoglobulin has been implicated. This type of mechanism is not without prece-
dent, having been demonstrated in both a child [12] and adults [13] with aregenerative
anemias. Although the stimulus for development of this autoantibody is unknown, the
many similarities of TEC with childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, felt to
be triggered by a prior viral infection, would suggest a viral etiology.
Evidence for serum inhibition of erythroid colony formation in patients with
congenital hemolytic anemia in the midst of an aplastic crisis has been reported by
Mortimer et al. [14]. Inhibition in these patients, however, appears to be due to a
serum parvovirus-like virus (SPLV) and not by an immune mechanism [1 5]. Sera from
our patients with TEC were tested for SPLV antigen (kindly performed by Dr. Neal
Young) and found to be negative, as have previous studies of TEC sera [15]. Thus,
direct viral suppression by SPLV does not appear to be an explanation for the serum
inhibition seen in patients with TEC.
It is also clear from the studies of patients with TEC that not all will have the typical
in vitro findings which are seen in those with inhibitors. Most of these "atypical"
patients have decreased erythroid proliferation at diagnosis without demonstrable
serum inhibition of colony formation in an autologous system. Since cell-mediated
suppression of erythropoiesis was found in one patient with TEC as well as having been
reported in patients with other types of anemia [16, 17], this could be an explanation
for the findings. Nonimmune mechanisms directly toxic to erythroid progenitors and
limiting their normal proliferation or differentiation could also explain the results.
Finally, in some instances the assay system may be too insensitive to demonstrate a
weak serum inhibitor.
It is of interest that although in vitro erythropoiesis is variable, the clinical syndrome
is usually quite predictable. There are, however, some exceptions. The patient studied
by Freedman and Saunders with no evidence of serum or cell-mediated suppression of
colony formation was atypical because of her older age at presentation (ten years), the
presence of hepatosplenomegaly, and a positive antinuclear factor. Patient 4 in the
present study had decreased erythroid colonies at diagnosis with no demonstrable
serum inhibitor and, although he had the usual course for TEC, subsequently
developed marrow failure. Another patient described by Freedman [18] presented with
the typical findings of TEC, yet had a prolonged course with a recurrent episode of
anemia and reticulocytopenia. This patient had normal erythropoiesis at diagnosis with
evidence of a serum inhibitor, which was shown to be an IgM immunoglobulin and not

the more frequently found IgG. The clinical course of these patients as well as the
variable in vitro erythropoiesis of this disorder support the hypothesis of a heteroge-
neous pathogenesis. With further refinements of in vitro technique, increased under-
standing of both the immune and possibly the nonimmune mechanisms of the disease,
and further correlation of the clinical course with the laboratory data, a clearer picture
of TEC may be possible.
