INTRODUCTION
A mitochondrion is a membrane-enclosed intracellular
organelle in most eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria generate
most of the cell’s supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP),
used as a source of chemical energy. In addition to supply-
ing cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in cell signal-
ing, cellular differentiation, apoptosis, as well as the control
of the cell cycle and cell growth. The number of mitochon-
dria in a cell varies widely by organism and tissue type (1).
Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) consists of 16,569
base pairs in a supercoiled, double stranded circular molecule.
The maternally inherited genome contains 37 genes coding
for 13 polypeptides of the mitochondrial electron respirato-
ry chain, 22 tRNAs and two rRNAs necessary for synthesis
of the polypeptides (2). Nucleated animal cells contain about
1,000 mitochondria and each mitochondrion contains 2-10
mtDNAs, therefore, a typical differentiated cell has about
3,000 copies of mtDNA for every diploid copy of the genome
in the nucleus, non-nucleated cells like platelets and red blood
cells have 1-3 and 0 mitochondria per cell, respectively (1).
mtDNA is replicated with a high mutation rate because
mtDNA has no protective histones and also lacks an effec-
tive DNA repair system, moreover, mtDNA is located near
the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it is exposed to
oxygen free radicals generated by the respiratory chain (3).
Mitochondrial defects occur in a wide variety of degenerative
diseases, aging, and cancer. Mitochondrial diseases encom-
pass an extraordinary assemblage of clinical problems, com-
monly involving tissues that have high energy requirements
such as heart, muscle, and the renal and endocrine systems
(4). Pathogenic mtDNA defects (deletions and point muta-
tions) affect at least 1 in 15,000 of the adult population (5).
To date, over 100 point mutations, 200 deletions and rear-

Mitochondrial DNA Aberrations of Bone Marrow Cells from Patients
with Aplastic Anemia
This study was undertaken primarily to test the hypothesis that mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) mutations may be associated with aplastic anemia. Complete mtDNA
nucleotide sequence was analyzed in nine and eight bone marrow specimens from
Korean patients with aplastic anemia and healthy individuals, respectively. We found
a large number of polymorphisms as well as apparent new mutations in both patients
and controls throughout the entire mtDNA genome; 12 mutations harbored amino
acid changes in patients and none of the mutations in controls produced amino
acid changes. There were heteroplasmic mutations and more nonsynonymous
mtDNA changes observed in patients, so the mean number of mtDNA aberrations
of bone marrow cells showed statistically significant difference overall between
patients (mean=25.6) and controls (mean=12.8) (p=0.019). Our data may support
an association of mtDNA aberrations with aplastic anemia.

mtDNA Aberrations in Aplastic Anemia 1063
rangements have been associated with disease, and new muta-
tions are being described every year (1).
Aplastic anemia (AA) has been traditionally but unhelp-
fully characterized as ‘heterogenous’ based on the many differ-
ent putative etiologies such as idiopathic, secondary causes
(radiation, drug and chemicals, viruses and immune diseases),
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and pregnancy (6).
Among these etiologies, radiation, some drugs and chemi-
cals apparently give rise to mtDNA abnormalities (7-9). We
hypothesized that AA may be associated with mtDNA aber-
rations. In the present study we analyzed the entire mtDNA
nucleotide sequences from nine and eight bone marrow (BM)
specimens from Korean patients with AA and healthy indi-
viduals, respectively. This is the first comprehensive investi-
gation of entire mtDNA genome in patients with AA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and healthy subjects
The study included 9 Korean patients with AA (male 5
and female 4) and 8 normal healthy controls (male 6 and
female 2). There is no statistical significant difference of age
distribution between patients (mean±SD, 39.7±18.7) and
normal controls (41.9±14.2) (p=0.395). BM and buccal
mucosa (M) specimens were collected after informed consent
was obtained following to protocols from the Institutional
Review Board of the Chonnam National University Hwasun
Hospital (Hwasun, Korea). AA was diagnosed by peripheral
blood and BM findings according to criteria of the Interna-
tional Study of AA and Agranulocytosis.
Entire mitochondrial DNA, oligonucleotide primers and
direct sequencing
Total DNA was extracted using an AccuPrep Genomic
DNA Extraction Kit (Bioneer, Daejon, Korea). Extracted
DNA was resuspended in Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer (pH 7.5)
containing 10 mM Tris and 1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic
acid (EDTA). For the direct sequencing of the entire mtDNA
genome, we used 20 primer pairs based on a modification of
a published protocol in order to obtain 20 partially overlap-
ping segments (10). Each amplified mtDNA product was
purified using an AccuPrep PCR Purification Kit (Bioneer)
and sequenced with a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Ready Reac-
tion Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, U.S.A.) and
an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Forty oligonucleotide primers derived from Levin et al. (11)
were used in sequencing the entire mtDNA genome.
Determination of polymorphism and mutation
mtDNA sequences experimentally obtained were com-
pared to the Revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (http://
www.mitomap.org) (12) using the Blast2 program (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/bl2seq/bl2.htlm) and the data-
base search tool, MitoAnalyzer (http://www.cstl.nist.gov/
biotech/strbase/mitoanalyzer.html, 2001), in order to obtain
preliminary evidence for polymorphisms, mutations, and
translation of amino acids. Results obtained from AA patients
also were compared with those obtained from our concurrent-
ly tested normal healthy subjects and established published
and unpublished database of mtDNA polymorphism (http://
www.mitomap.org), and we treated mtDNA aberrations
found in both aforementioned polymorphism database and

normal healthy controls as polymorphisms. When mtDNA
nucleotide change was only observed in AA patients, it was
considered a new mutation. New mutations were confirmed
by re-amplification of the region using a separate cell speci-
men for DNA extraction.
Statistical analysis
The Mann-Whitney test was used to evaluate statistical
differences in the numbers of affected mtDNA genes, newly
detected mtDNA mutations, and amino acid changes bet-
ween patients and normal volunteers; p<0.05 was considered
significant.
RESULTS
mtDNA nucleotide changes in healthy subjects
Among hematological normal control subjects, in each con-
trols there were numerous mtDNA sequence variants (No=
102, mean=12.8), which consisted of 75 polymorphisms
already listed in a published polymorphism database (http://
infinity.gen.emory.edu/mitomap.html) and 27 new sequence
variations (mean=3.4) not previously recorded, including
unpublished mtDNA polymorphisms. These nucleotide
changes among the eight normal controls were distributed
throughout the mitochondrial genome, and none of new
sequence variants led to amino acid changes (Table 3).
mtDNA nucleotide aberrations in patients
A total of 230 mtDNA nucleotide changes were detected
throughout the mtDNA genome. Thirty-two mtDNA vari-
ants were newly detected in BM specimens from nine AA
patients (mean=3.6). These were 30 substitutions and two
deletions at the protein genes for nicotinamide adenine din-
ucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase (N=17), cytochrome c
oxidase (N=6), cytochrome b (N=3), non-coding region (N=
3), ATPase 6 (N=1), and tRNA (N=1) (Table 3). Among
them, twelve mutations (38%) harbored amino acid changes
(Table 3). There was no predominant mutation site (hot spot).
To determine heteroplasmy, we additionally tested buccal
mucosa cells. In two of the nine patients there were hetero-
plasmic sequence variants, which were only present in BM
samples, all the other newly detected mtDNA aberrations
appeared homoplasmic mutations (Table 1 and Fig. 1).
The pattern of mtDNA sequence variations
Nucleotide substitution rather than deletion accounted
for the majority pattern of nucleotide changes. The transi-
tion type was more prevalent than the transversion type
and deletion. A strong strand bias is more expressed in the
HV1 region where transitions between pyrimidines consti-
tute a majority of the mutations, and the frequencies of
transversion were higher in the HV1 region than the HV2
region.

DISCUSSION
mtDNA has been widely used for forensic identification
and in anthropological studies because of its abundance and
inherent variability. Furthermore, several hundred human
diseases have been associated with maternally inherited spe-
cific deletions and mutations (13). Somatically acquired
mtDNA mutations also have been linked to aging and degen-
erative diseases, cancer, and autoimmunity (4). A large dele-
tion of mtDNA is a hallmark of Pearson’s syndrome, a con-
stitutional disorder that includes sideroblastic anemia (14).
mtDNA mutations recently were reported also in apparent-
ly acquired sideroblastic anemia and in myelodysplastic syn-
dromes in general (15). While we were unable to confirm
these results by amplification and direct sequencing of the
entire mtDNA genome in patients and normal controls, we
coincidentally observed marked sequence variation in mar-
row mtDNA among different normal donors (16).
The pathophysiology of acquired AA is complicated. Com-
plexity can be inferred from the diversity of putative etio-
logic associations from drugs and chemicals to viruses and
pregnancy (6). Normal hematopoiesis is dependent upon
the transcription and translation of mtDNA into functional
proteins. Mitochondrial protein synthesis is selectively blocked
by nitrobenzene antibiotic chloramphenicol via its direct
action on the large ribosomal subunit of organelle. Acquired
deletions of mtDNA in the hematopoietic compartment have
also been observed to occur in association with severe pancy-
topenia and reticulocytopenia (7). For these reasons, in current
study we undertook to determine the entire sequence of BM
mtDNA from nine AA patients and a comparable number
of normal controls. In this study, we found a large number
of polymorphisms as well as apparent new mutations in both
patients and controls. mtDNA nucleotide changes that
were present in our normal controls as well as those in pub-
lished databases were counted as polymorphisms. Overall,
there was significant increase in the number of mtDNA
genes harboring polymorphisms or ‘new’ mutations between
AA patients and normal controls. Among the nine patients,
twelve mutations producing nonsynonymous alterations
were found in NADH dehydrogenase (ND)1, cytochrome c oxi-
dase (CO)I, COII, COIII, ND4, ND5 and cytochrome b. We
did not observe small and large deletions that characterize
Pearson’s syndrome (14), or deletions observed in some other
constitutional mtDNA diseases.
The direct relationship between mtDNA mutations and
acquired AA development has not studied yet. However,
concerning the potential role in mtDNA mutations may
contribute to genomic instability (17). For example, defi-
cient mitochondrial ATP production due to mtDNA muta-
tion may promote chromosomal instability. Since the mitot-
ic spindle apparatus depends on ATP-consuming motor pro-
teins, cells with inadequate ATP supply may have difficulty
in correctly segregating their chromosomes during mitosis.
ATP deficiency may often another pathway to genomic insta-
bility through impairment of ATP-dependent DNA repair.
Furthermore, respiratory chain dysfunction may impede
pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis (17). Thus mtDNA muta-
tions in hematopoietic tissue might be related with AA patho-
physiology as a causative and/or aggravating factor. Further
study is needed to investigate the direct role of mtDNA muta-
tions of hematopoietic cells in AA pathophysiology and clin-
ical implication.
Most researchers in human mitochondrial genetics feels that
heteroplasmic (a mixture of mutant and wild-type mtDNA)
is to be considered pathogenic (1). We detected typical het-
eroplasmic mutations in two patients. It is tempting to
associate the limited new mutations seen in these patients
with the pathophysiology of AA. Thus, we believe that a
more likely and stringent interpretation is that these appar-
ent abnormalities are secondary to the small numbers of stem
cell clones operating to support hematopoiesis in this BM
failure syndrome.
