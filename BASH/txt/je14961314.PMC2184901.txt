Earlier studies from this and other laboratories demonstrated that certain naturally
occurring steroid metabolites, formerly considered to be physiologically inactive end
products of hormone metabolism, strongly stimulate porphyrin and &aminolevulinic
acid synthase (ALA-S)1formation in cultured chick embryo liver eeUs (1, 2) as well as
in vivo in the liver of the chick embryo (3). Steroid metabolites with a 5fl-structure
(A:B cis) were more potent in this respect than their 5a-epimers or their parent
compounds. 5fl-steroids which induce porphyrin synthesis in chick embryo liver cells
have also been shown to induce the early synthesis of hemoglobin in the erythroblasts
of the chick blastoderm (4) and a 5fl-steroid receptor in this primitive avian tissue has
been identified (5).
These steroid metabolites have been also reported to stimulate erythropoiesis in
vivo in mice. For example, Gorshein and Gardner (6) described enhanced erythro-
poiesis in exhypoxic polycythemic mice after 5fl-steroid administration as determined
by 59Fe incorporation into peripheral erythrocytes. Gordon et al. (7) reported similar
results using both normal and poiycythemic mice; in addition, their study showed
that an antibody preparation against erythropoietin abolished the effects of testoster-
one, but not those of 5fl-steroids. These data thus suggested that 5fl-steroids can have
effects on erythropoiesis that are independent of the action of erythropoietin. Besa et
al. (8) later demonstrated that the 5fl-compound, etiocholanolone (5fl-androstan-3a-
ol-17-one), increased erythrocyte mass in squirrel monkeys, confirming that such
steroid metabolites may stimulate erythropoiesis not only in the erythroid tissues of
birds, rodents, but also in vivo in primates. 5fl-steroids have also been demonstrated
to increase both heme and globin synthesis in suspension cultures of human bone
marrow cells (9, 10).
The development of newer methodology for the study of hematopoietic stem cells
in culture (11-13) made it possible to examine the mechanism and site of action of
erythropoietin and steroids on the development of erythroid colonies in semisolid
media (14). Using rat bone marrow cells, Singer et al. (15) reported that certain
steroids enhanced erythroid colony growth in vitro and suggested that etiocholanolone,
a prototype 5fl-steroid, may act on early erythroid progenitor cells (16). The clinical

usefulness of this specific metabolite in the therapy of patients with severe bone
marrow failure has been suggested by the studies of Besa et al. (17).
The present study was undertaken to examine the influence of steroid metabolite
pairs which are epimeric at the C5 position on the development of erythroid colonies
derived from human bone marrow using an in vitro semisolid culture method (12).
This technique permits an evaluation of the effects of chemicals on erythroid colony
growth; such growth is dependent on cellular proliferative activity. The data obtained
show that steroid metabolites enhance the in vitro growth of both early primitive
erythroid progenitors, i.e. burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E), and later erythroid
progenitors, i.e. colony-forming units-erythroid (CFU-E) of normal human bone
marrow; they indicate that 5fl-compounds are generally more potent in this growth
promoting effect than their 5a-epimers; and they demonstrate a steroid effect on a
very early stage of erythroid differentiation.
Materials and Methods
Steroid Metabolites. Steroids were either purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis,
Mo.) or prepared by standard synthetic methods from appropriate steroid precursors by Dr. H.
L. Bradlow, Laboratory of Steroid Biochemistry, The Rockefeller University, N. Y. All
compounds were purified by recrystallization from appropriate solvent mixtures. The purity of
each compound was rigorously established by comparison with standards of known purity using
two or more thin-layer chromatographic systems. No compound was utilized in these studies
which was not shown to be homogeneous. Steroids were dissolved in propylene glycol and
added to the bone marrow culture at a concentration of 10-7 M, which has been shown to be
optimal for erythroid colony formation (15). C5 epimerie pairs of steroids were studied in all
experiments.
Erythroid ColonyAssay. Erythroid progenitors (BFU-E and CFU-E) were assayed using the
in vitro culture technique which was originally described by Iscove et ai. (12) with minor
modifications. Briefly, aliquots of bone marrow specimens aspirated from iliac crests of healthy
adults at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Bone Marrow Donor Center were provided to us
through the courtesy of Dr. M. J. Murphy, Jr. Diluted marrow cells (1:2 to 1:5) in a-medium
(Flow Laboratories, Inc. Rockville, Md.) were applied to a 6.4% Ficoll 400 (Pharmacia Fine
Chemicals, Div. of Pharmacia Inc., Piscataway, N. J.), 9.8% sodium metrizoate (Nygaard Co.,
Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp., Hicksville, N. Y.) solution as described previously (18),
and interface fractions were collected. Mononucleated cells which had been harvested from the
interface were treated with NH4CI:Tris HCI (pH 7.4): KHCO~ solution (19) to iyse contami-
nating erythrocytes. 2 × 10s nucleated cells were resuspended in 1 ml of a-medium containing
0.8% methyleelluiose (The Dow Chemical Co., Midland, Mich.), 30% fetal bovine serum (Flow
Laboratories, Inc., Rockville, Md.), 1% bovine serum albumin (Calbiochem-Behring Corp.,
American Hoeset Corp., San Diego, Calif.), and 0.1, 0.25 or 0.5 IU of Step III sheep plasma
erythropoietin (Connaught Laboratories, Ontario, Canada) and the cells were placed in a 35
× 10 mm plastic Petri dish (Lux Scientific Corp., Newbury Park, Calif.). The cell suspensions
were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 in air with saturated humidity. The number of red to
reddish erythroid colonies containing >8 cells (CFU-E) was counted after 7 d of incubation,
and the number of erythroid bursts having macroscopic dimensions of clusters of erythroblasts
(BFU-E) was enumerated on day 14, using an inverted microscope without staining, as reported
previously (20, 21).
Assay of BFU-E and CFU-E. Three sets of experiments were conducted. In the first, the
influence of the continued presence of steroids on the development of BFU-E and CFU-E was
examined in the presence of erythropoietin. Each steroid was added to cultures of normal
at a 10- -M concentration and the cultures were incubated in thehuman bone marrow cells 7
presence of 0.1 IU of erythropoietin. The numbers of CFU-E and BFU-E were counted on
appropriate days as indicated above. Uroporphyrinogen-I synthase (URO-S) activity was
determined as described earlier (22) in the cells which were harvested from duplicate plates
after having enumerated the numbers of CFU-E on day 7.
1316 STEROID METABOLITE EFFECT ON HUMAN ERYTHROID COLONY
Secondly, the effect of preincubation with steroids, followed by incubation with erythropoi-
etin, on the development of BFU-E and CFU-E was examined. Cells were preincuhated with
10-v M of each steroid solution in a-medium containing 40% fetal calf serum and 10% bovine
serum albumin for 48 h at 37°C in 5% CO2-95% air. After a 48-h incubation, cells were washed
with modified Ham's F 12 medium (19) three times, and then resuspended in semi-solid medium
containing methylcellulose in the presence of 0.5 IU of erythropoietin. BFU-E and CFU-E were
counted on day 14 and day 7 of incubation, respectively.
The purpose of the third experiment was to evaluate the effect of delayed addition of steroids
on the formation of erythroid colonies. Marrow cells were incubated in the semi-solid medium
in the presence of 0.25 IU of erythropoietin, and either 5a- or 5/3-androstane-3a, 1l/~-diol-17-
one was added to culture dishes on day 0, day 2, or day 4 at a 10-7-M final concentration.
These metabolites are derived from the adrenal hormone 11/~-hydroxyandrostenedione. Neither
the 5or-nor the 5]~-metabolite of this adrenal hormone has androgenic properties. The numbers
of BFU-E and CFU-E were counted as described above. For statistical analysis, the Student's
t test was used.
Liver Cell Cultures. For studies of the effects of steroids on ALA-S synthesis and porphyrin
formation in liver cells, serum-free cultures of chick embryo liver cells were prepared, and
determinations of ALA-S activity and porphyrin concentrations were carried out as described
previously (19).
Results
Benzidine staining, using acidic solutions for the detection of hemoglobinized cells,
may also give rise to positive staining with granulocyte-macrophage colonies that
contain peroxidases. To avoid false-positive results, red or reddish colonies without
staining were counted as reported previously (20, 21). Morphological identification of
erythroblasts was made after Wright-Giemsa staining of smeared cell preparations
prepared by a Cytocentrifuge (Shandon Southern Instruments Inc., Sewickley, Pa.).
Numbers of BFU-E and CFU-E increased in a dose-dependent manner as a function
of erythropoietin concentrations as well as a function of the input cell number. No
erythroid colonies (CFU-E) or erythroid bursts (BFU-E) were observed with steroid
treatment alone in the absence of erythropoietin (data not shown).
Table 1 shows the effects of the continued presence of each steroid throughout the
entire incubation period on erythroid colony formation. Out of six pairs of steroids
tested, four of the pairs (A-D) were C19 compounds and two (E, F) were C21 steroids.
The steroids alone were not stimulatory on erythroid colony formation in the absence
of erythropoietin. However, when cultures contained 0.1 U of erythropoietin/ml,
certain steroids enhanced the growth of both CFU-E and BFU-E. In this respect, 5fl-
steroids were nearly always more effective than their 5a-epimers. Specifically, all four
androstanes (A-D) and one (F) out of two pregnanes (E, F) having the 5fl-structure,
were more effective in increasing CFU-E significantly as compared with control
cultures which were treated with erythropoietin alone; both 5a-pregnane derivatives
(E, F) also stimulated CFU-E formation and one of these compounds (E) was more
active than the 5fl-epimer. No C19 5a-steroid significantly increased BFU-E and
CFU-E formation. All 5fl-steroids increased BFU-E significantly. The extent of
stimulation of erythroid colonies by the active steroids ranged from 200 to 260% for
CFU-E and from 140 to 200% for BFU-E above controls.
We have previously reported that the activity of URO-S, a cytosolic enzyme in the
heine biosynthetic pathway, is an early and sensitive marker for erythroid differentia-
tion both in mouse Friend erythroleukemia cells (23) and in normal human bone
marrow cultures (24). URO-S activity determined in cells harvested on day 7 after

incubation with steroids and erythropoietin exhibited a general parallelism to the
activity ratio of 5fl- and 5a-compounds in inducing CFU-E formation (data not
shown).
Preincubation of cells with 5a- and 5fl-steroids (seven pairs) for 48 h, followed by
incubation with erythropoietin, did not reveal any effect of either 5a- or 5fl-steroids
on the growth of CFU-E (Table II). On the other hand, in five of the seven pairs of
compounds, the 5fl-epimer significantly enhanced the growth of BFU-E (Table II).
Dihydroxycoprostane and trihydroxycoprostane, which are 5fl-neutral sterols and
normal intermediates in bile acid synthesis from cholesterol, also displayed significant
stimulation of BFU-E, but not of CFU-E formation. These steroids have been shown
to be porphyrinogenic in avian liver cells (25).
Table III depicts the effects of the administration of a pair of 5a- and 5fl-steroids
after initiation of cultures. The 5a-compound had no stimulatory effect on BFU-E
and CFU-E formation irrespective of the time of addition to the cultures. The 5fl-
steroid enhanced the colony growth of CFU-E only when added simultaneously with
the establishment of the cultures; this derivative also enhanced BFU-E formation
when added within 2 d after the initiation of the cultures, but did not further affect
erythroid colony development when added thereafter. These cultures contained 0.25
U/ml erythropoietin throughout the incubation periods.
The same steroid solutions in propylene glycol were tested for induction of porphy-
rins (13 or 16 #M) in serum-free cultures of chick embryo liver cells using our
technique described previously (19) and induction of ALA-S (2.5 or 10/.tmol/egg) in

the chick embryo liver in ovo. 2 These steroid concentrations were found to be optimal
for induction in the respective model systems. As indicated in Table IV, 5~-steroids
were generally more potent than 5a-steroids with respect to both the induction of
porphyrinogenesis and the stimulation of ALA-S formation.
Discussion
The results of this study demonstrate that certain 5a- and 5~-steroid metabolites
are effective in enhancing the growth, in cultured human bone marrow cells, of both
BFU-E and CFU-E in the presence of a low dose of erythropoietin. In this respect,
five of six steroids of the 5~-configuration tested, were effective in significantly
increasing CFU-E (Table I) and all 5fl-steroids increased BFU-E significantly (Table
I). In contrast, only two 5a-steroids stimulated the growth of CFU-E, and no 5a-
steroids stimulated the growth of BFU-E. No steroids demonstrated an inhibitory
effect on erythroid colony formation.
These data are consistent with earlier observations which showed a greater potency

1320 STEROID METABOLITE EFFECT ON HUMAN ERYTHROID COLONY
of 5/~-steroids as compared with 5a-steroids in the induction of porphyrin-heme
biosynthesis in avian embryonic liver (1-3), as well as the stimulation oferythropoiesis
in developing avian blastoderm (4). This structure-activity relationship of steroid
metabolites was subsequently shown to extend to heme and globin synthesis in human
bone marrow cells in suspension cultures (9, 10). More potent actions of 5/~-steroids,
as compared with 5a-steroids, have also been shown by ~gFe incorporation into
erythrocytes in exhypoxic polycythemic mice (6, 7), ALA-S induction in the chick
blastoderm (26), and by in vitro growth stimulation of CFU-E using rat bone marrow
cultures (15).
Extensive studies on structure-inducibility relationships of these steroids on CFU-E
formation by Singer et al. (15) clearly indicated that most 5/~-metabolites are potent
inducers of erythropoiesis in rodent bone marrow. The summary of 5/~- and 5a-
inducing ratios shown in Table IV confirms, in the tissue types indicated (human
bone marrow and avian liver), the generally more potent inducing activity of the 5/~-
steroid structure. A common phenomenon occurring in these systems after treatment
with 5/~-steroids is the induction of ALA-S with a subsequent increase in porphyrins
or heme (1-3, 27). Induction of this rate-limiting enzyme in heine synthesis has, in
fact, been suggested as a key metabolic event in the mechanism by which steroid
metabolites exert their stimulatory effects on heine synthesis (9, 27).
Because steroid metabolites may exhibit equal or greater biological potency in these
systems than their precursor hormones, the role of hormone biotransformation to
active derivatives in these systems remains a matter for further study; the phenomenon
of metabolic conversion of parent chemical structures to biologically active derivatives
by microsomal and other cellular enzymes is common and is known to extend to
hormones. It should be noted that on a molar basis steroid metabolites are at least
100-fold more active in stimulating erythroid colony formation from human bone
marrow cells than they are in inducing ALA-S or porphyrin formation in avian liver
cells. This sensitivity of bone marrow cells to steroids including glucocorticoids extends
to other species such as rats (15) rabbits (28), and man (29), suggesting an intrinsic
biological characteristic of these cell types as compared with hepatic cells. Stimulation
of BFU-E formation by the coprostane compounds is of particular interest because
these neutral sterol metabolites of cholesterol are produced in large amounts in man.
The structure-inducibility relationship of these steroid metabolites to BFU-E, the
most primitive erythroid progenitor cells, has not been extensively examined, except
for the single pair of metabolites studied by Fisher et al. (28). These authors found,
utilizing rabbit bone marrow cultures, that both the parent hormone, testosterone,
and its metabolites, 5a- and 5/~-dihydrotesterone (DHT) stimulated the in vitro
growth of BFU-E in the presence of erythropoietin but that 5~-DHT was significantly
more potent than the 5a derivative of the hormone (5a-DHT) in this action (28).
When animals were pretreated with these steroids, both testosterone and 5/~-DHT,
but not 5a-DHT, gave rise to increased erythroid-colony formation in culture (28).
These in vivo findings in rabbits contrast with earlier studies carried out by a
cooperative group study utilizing polycythemic mice as a model test system (30). In
any event, it appears from recent work that 5/~-DHT is clearly more effective in
stimulating erythroid differentiation in vivo in the rabbit than is 5a-DHT, and that
this relative potency of 5/~-DHT over 5a-DHT extends to cultured erythroid cells
from this species (28).

Our results in this study represent the first demonstration in normal human marrow
cell cultures that certain C 19 and C21 metabolites stimulate erythroid colony growth
and that 5/~-metabolites are generally more potent in this action than their correspond-
ing epimers. In our experiments, BFU-E formation was enhanced by short-term
preincubation with or the continued presence of 5fi-steroids in the cultures, whereas
CFU-E formation was not enhanced by a preincubation with steroids; rather their
continued presence throughout the incubation period was required. This suggests that
the growth of erythroid colonies by day 7 may be, in part, a result of enhanced colony
formation derived from steroid-responsive erythroid progenitor cells which may lie
between BFU-E and CFU-E. In fact, human erythroid cells appear to represent a
continuous and wide spectrum of erythropoietic precursors (21, 31). URO-S activity
in cells which were harvested after 7 d of incubation, showed that 5fl-steroids were, in
general, more stimulatory of this enzyme activity than 5a-compounds (data not
shown). This enhanced URO-S activity most likely reflects increased proliferation of
erythroid cells in the cultures; however, in lymphocytes induction of the enzyme
appears to take place after mitogen-stimulation (32).
The cellular response to erythropoietin is considered to appear in the developmental
stage between BFU-E and CFU-E (33) (Fig. 1). In this respect, our results, after
preincubation of human bone marrow cells with steroids, are interesting in that 5/~-
steroids increased only BFU-E formation but not CFU-E. This suggests that the effect
of 5/~-steroids on erythroid progenitors is directed towards an even earlier stage of
erythroid differentiation than that of erythropoietin-responsive cells (Fig. 1). Singer
and Adamson (16), using velocity sedimentation and cell-cycle kinetic techniques,
reported that the etiocholanolone-responsive erythroid progenitors showed many
similarities to those of BFU-E type and were different from erythropoietin-dependent
CFU-E. Because the 3H-thymidine suicide rate of etiocholanolone-responsive cells was
substantially lower than that of erythropoietin-responsive cells, they concluded that
this 5/~-steroid probably acts on a separate, perhaps more primitive population of
marrow cells (16). It is also known that an antibody preparation to erythropoietin
abolishes the erythropoietic effect of testosterone in in vivo exhypoxic polycythemic
mice (7, 34) but not that of 5fl-steroids (7). Our results in Table III further substantiate
the idea that 5fi-steroids act principally on early erythroid progenitor cells; as noted,
for example in Table III the 5/~-derivative enhanced the growth of CFU-E colonies
only when it was added on day 0, and increased the formation of BFU-E only when
1322 STEROID METABOLITE EFFECT ON HUMAN ERYTHROID COLONY
it was added on day 0 or day 2, but not thereafter. These findings suggest that the
functional responses of early erythroid progenitor cells to steroids may be rapidly lost
in cultures after 48 h and that delayed addition of steroids to the cultured cells has
little effect on the maturation of erythroid percursors.
Hormonal effects on erythropoiesis have been recognized for a long time (35).
Differences of erythrocyte count, hemoglobin concentration, and hematocrit are
known to exist between men and women and are considered to be a result of the effect
of gonadal hormones (36). Androgen therapy for anemia in patients with a variety of
blood disorders (37, 38), including aplastic anemia (39), was initiated almost two
decades ago but still presents troublesome problems of masculinization and growth
side-effects in women and children. Those steroid metabolites known to lack andro-
genicity (i.e. 5fl-derivatives) may prove useful in treatment of certain intractable
anemias of man, but extensive clinical studies of this possibility have not been
undertaken to our knowledge. Recently, Besa et al. (17) reported that one 5fl-steroid,
etiocholanolone, could stimulate erythropoiesis in some patients with aplastic anemia.
It should be noted, however, that certain 5fl-steroids (including etiocholanolone)
which are known to induce heme synthesis also have potent inflammatory and fever-
producing activity in man (40); certain other 5fl-derivatives which can activate the
heme pathway do not have these properties. Thus, a careful selection of 5fl-steroids
with appropriate consideration of their structural and biological properties is necessary
for human studies.
It should be emphasized that the steroids utilized in this study are derived from the
in vivo biotransformation of endogenous hormones. The localization of the develop-
mental stage at which these steroids act on erythroid progenitor cells is of considerable
fundamental interest and may provide useful information regarding the mechanisms
and sites of steroid actions on cell growth. It may also facilitate the use of these
physiologically derived compounds for the stimulation of erythropoiesis in certain
forms of bone marrow failure in man as we have suggested earlier (1, 4).
Summary
Certain C19 and C21 steroid metabolites, when incubated with normal human
bone marrow cells in culture, increased the number of erythroid colonies in the
presence of erythropoietin. Among a number of pairs of C5 epimeric steroids tested,
most 5fl (A:B cis) steroids stimulated the growth of both early erythroid progenitor
cells (BFU-E) and late erythroid progenitor cells (CFU-E), whereas only a few 5a-(A:
B tram) steroids stimulated the growth of CFU-E. No 5a-compounds of six pairs of
steroids studied were found to stimulate BFU-E formation. This structure-activity
relationship conforms with that previously observed in studies of steroid induction of
ALA-synthase in avian embryo liver cells and hemoglobin synthesis in the cultured
avian blastoderm.
When human bone marrow cells were preincubated with the steroids for 2 d,
followed by incubation with erythropoietin, only the 5fl-compounds stimulated the
growth of BFU-E. Similarly, when addition of steroids was delayed in relation to
erythropoietin in the culture, only the 5/~-derivative of a pair of C5 epimeric
compounds displayed an enhancing effect on the growth of BFU-E. This effect
required that the steroid addition be made no later than 48 h after initiation of the
culture. These data demonstrate that certain natural steroid metabolites significantly
AKIO URABE, SHIGERU SASSA, AND ATTALLAH KAPPAS 1323
stimulate erythropoiesis in normal human bone marrow cells in culture. They also
indicate that 5~8-compounds are more stimulatory than their 5~x-epimers, and they
suggest that these 5,8-steroids act preferentially on very primitive erythroid progenitor
cells, probably on BFU-E.
We are indebted to Dr. H. L. Bradlow, Laboratory of Steroid Biochemistry, The Rockefeller
University, for the preparation and purification of steroids used in this study. A. U. is indebted

Research, for their generous support.
