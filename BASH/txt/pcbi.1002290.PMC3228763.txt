Abstract
Most tissues in multicellular organisms are maintained by continuous cell renewal processes. However, high turnover of
many cells implies a large number of error-prone cell divisions. Hierarchical organized tissue structures with stem cell driven
cell differentiation provide one way to prevent the accumulation of mutations, because only few stem cells are long lived.
We investigate the deterministic dynamics of cells in such a hierarchical multi compartment model, where each
compartment represents a certain stage of cell differentiation. The dynamics of the interacting system is described by
ordinary differential equations coupled across compartments. We present analytical solutions for these equations, calculate
the corresponding extinction times and compare our results to individual based stochastic simulations. Our general
compartment structure can be applied to different tissues, as for example hematopoiesis, the epidermis, or colonic crypts.
The solutions provide a description of the average time development of stem cell and non stem cell driven mutants and can
be used to illustrate general and specific features of the dynamics of mutant cells in such hierarchically structured
populations. We illustrate one possible application of this approach by discussing the origin and dynamics of PIG-A mutant
clones that are found in the bloodstream of virtually every healthy adult human. From this it is apparent, that not only the
occurrence of a mutant but also the compartment of origin is of importance.

Introduction
Many tissues have a hierarchical multi compartment structure
in which each compartment represents a cell type at a certain stage
of differentiation. This architecture has been well described for
hematopoiesis [1,2] and epidermal cell turnover in the skin [3,4]
or in the colonic crypt [5]. At the root of this process are the tissue
specific stem cells that have the capacity to differentiate into more
specialized cells [6]. Each cell undergoes a series of cell divisions
and differentiation steps until the whole diversity of the tissue is
obtained [1,2,7–11]. The model presented here closely follows this
concept. We introduce in total kz1 compartments, where each
compartment i represents a certain stage of cell differentiation with
i~0 representing the stem cell pool. Each cell in a compartment i
replicates at a rate ri. If a cell in a non stem cell compartment iw0
replicates, it can undergo three different processes: With
probability ei, it divides into two more differentiated cells that
migrate into the adjacent downstream compartment iz1. With
probability li, the cell dies. With probability 1{ei{li, it divides
into two cells that retain the properties of their parent cell and
therefore remain in the same compartment i (self-renewal), as
shown in Fig. 1. Thus in compartment i, the number of cells Ni is
increased by influx from the adjacent upstream compartment i{1
and self-renewal within compartment i, and decreased by cell
death in compartment i and cell differentiation into the adjacent
downstream compartment iz1. One could also allow asymmetric
cell divisions in non stem cell compartments. But the average
dynamics in this case can be captured by modifying the
differentiation probabilities e. Thus, this case is implicitly included
in our model. In the following, we shall assume a constant number
of stem cells N0, following [1,12]. This can be achieved via
asymmetric cell division [13,14]. However, one can also assume a
process at the stem cell level in which cell differentiation, cell death
and self renewal are balanced such that the average number of
cells remains constant, i.e. 2e0z2l0~1. For immortal stem cells,
l0~0, this means e0~0:5. However, for our purpose details of the
dynamics in the stem cell compartment are not relevant, as long as
the number of stem cells is constant.
This model does neglect several aspects that may have an
impact on the dynamics of the system under consideration, such as
biochemical feedback or spatial population structure [15–19].
However, due to the generality, our model can be seen as a
benchmark and thus allows to infer when such aspects are of
importance and when they can be ignored by a comparison
between the different model classes.
One special case of our framework is the model of hematopoi-
esis discussed in [1]. There, cell death is neglected, li~0 for all i.
Furthermore, an exponentially increasing proliferation rate
ri~ci
r0 and a constant differentiation probability ei~e are
assumed for all non stem cell compartments. In this work, we

relax these conditions and therefore our analytical arguments hold
for general values of ri, ei and li in each compartment and thus for
a wide class of related models and different tissues.
Methods
Mathematical model
The individual cell model is based on a finite number of cells
that divide and differentiate with certain probabilities. Thus, it is a
stochastic process [20] and fits the current view of the stochastic
nature of such cell differentiation processes [21]. However, the
average cell numbers can be captured by a system of coupled
differential equations that is deterministic. These equations follow
from a proper counting of incoming and outgoing cells within each
compartment i.
Let us assume that the number of stem cells N0 is constant,
following [1,12]. The number of cells in the first non stem cell
compartment i~1 increases by influx from the stem cell pool at a
rate r0N0 and due to self renewal at a rate 1{e1{l1ð Þr1N1. In
addition, the average number of cells in the compartment i~1 is
lowered by cell differentiation into the next compartment i~2 at
rate e1r1N1. Cell death in compartment i~1 occurs at rate
l1r1N1. The dynamics in all other compartments is the same,
except that the number of cells Ni in the compartment i increases
due to influx from the adjacent upstream compartment at rate
2ei{1ri{1Ni{1. Self renewal occurs at rate 1{ei{lið ÞriNi. Ni
decreases due to cell death at rate liriNi and cell differentiation at
rate eiriNi. Combining these terms and assuming in total kz1
compartments, we obtain a system of coupled differential
equations

differentiation and cell death and the gain from self renewal.

Author Summary
We investigate the average stem cell driven dynamics of
cell counts in an abstract multi compartment model.
Within this framework one can represent different tissue
structures, as for example hematopoiesis, the skin or the
colonic crypt. Our analysis is based on an individual cell
model in which cells can differentiate, reproduce or die.
We give closed solutions to the corresponding system of
coupled differential equations, that describe the average
dynamics of all cell types. There are three cases of interest:
(i) Mutations at the stem cell level, (ii) Mutations in
downstream compartments associated with more mature,
non stem cell types, (iii) Mutations in downstream
compartments with cells acquiring stem cell like proper-
ties. The average dynamics shows for (i) and (iii) an
increase of mutants towards an equilibrium, in case (ii) the
average mutant cell count goes through a maximum, but
mutants die out in the long run. We calculate the
corresponding extinction times for every compartment.
We discuss applications to hematopoietic diseases such as,
PIG-A mutant cells or the classic oncogene BCR-ABL.
Although the abstract model is a simplified sketch of cell
differentiation, it is capable of describing many aspects of
a wide variety of such tissues and associated diseases.

Thus, ai~eizli{(1{ei{li)~2eiz2li{1. Typically, we will
have aiw0, and this net loss of cells will be compensated from the
influx of cells from the upstream compartment.
Stochastic simulation
The simulations presented in this paper are individual based
stochastic simulations. We implement all elements of the first i
compartments separately, thus we are able to record the
dynamics of every single cell. Every cell division is called an
event. We use a standard Gillespie algorithm [22] to determine
in which compartment the next event takes place. After the
compartment is determined, one cell in this compartment is
chosen to divide proportional to the reproduction rate. The
outcome of this event is determined by the cell death and
differentiation probabilities li and ei. The dynamics in the stem
cell compartment is different: in our realization stem cells are
allowed to divide asymmetrically only, thus we keep the number
of stem cells constant. One could implement a Moran process
on the stem cell level also and therefore allow dynamics on the
stem cells [14]. However this would not change the aspects we
look at in this paper. The number of stem cell events determine
the time scale. We define 1 time unit as n stem cell events. For
example, in the hematopoietic system of a healthy adult human
we assume that there are approximately 400 stem cell divisions
a year.

Next, we turn to the process of filling empty compartments by a

consider interactions between different cell clones in our

mutation arising in the stem cell pool. Thus, we choose the initial

the basic model assumptions depicted in Fig. 1, this represents the
most general case. All thinkable stem cell driven effects can now be
described and followed in detail, as for example any change in the
equilibrium compartment sizes or any change of cell division
properties during cell differentiation. Compartments are contin-
uously filled with cells until they reach the equilibrium described
above. This can easily be deduced from (6), because all terms
involving decaying exponential functions in time will ultimately be
irrelevant for the cell counts.

In Fig. 2, equation (7) is compared to averages obtained from
an individual based stochastic simulation. Note that aw0 is
required to maintain an equilibrium. In this case we have

, the cell count in a compartment i
under equilibrium conditions. This is in agreement with former
results [23]. While we focus on the biologically relevant case of
aw0, we can also consider more general values of a. For av0, the
compartment produces more cells than it loses even in the absence
of cell influx from upstream. Thus, the number of cells would grow
exponentially according to equation (7) in each non stem cell
compartment. For a~0 the gain of cells due to self renewal and
the loss of cells due to differentiation and cell death in a
compartment is equal. Thus the number of cells are not changed
by processes in the compartment, despite a continuous output of
cells into the next downstream compartment. The case a~0
can be solved directly from Eqs. (1a)–(1c), which gives

Solution (6) describes the deterministic process of filling empty
compartments within hierarchical organized tissue structures, as
can occur during wound healing, recovery from hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation [18] or of in vitro experiments with fetal
liver cells [24]. However, it can also be viewed as the dynamics of a
mutant clone arising from a single cell in the stem cell pool,

N0~1. Thus, it is also possible to describe the average time
development of diseases caused by mutations at the stem cell level
such as the chronic myeloid neoplasms. Again, because we assume
there is no interaction between normal cells and mutated cells, the
dynamics of mutated cells proceeds independently, albeit with
different differentiation parameters.
Non stem cell driven dynamics
Next, we turn to mutations occurring downstream of the stem
cell compartment. The occurrence of a mutation in a non stem cell
compartment is more likely than a mutation in the stem cell pool
due to the higher numbers and proliferation rates of non stem
cells. The dynamics of such a mutant is not driven by the stem cell
pool and thus is not described by the solution form above,
equation (6). However, the compartment structure is unchanged
and thus the dynamics of such mutants is also described by
equations (1a)–(1c), but with altered initial conditions. Assuming
there is a mutation in compartment j, the initial condition is

Here Nij tð Þ represents the number of mutant cells in compartment
i at time t, whereas the mutation occurred in compartment j at
time t~0. According to this initial condition, the system of
coupled differential equations (1a)–(1c) turns into a homogenous
system and the dynamics of mutant cells is independent from the
first j equations, see Text S1 for details. Using the same tools as

Fig. 3 a) shows the dynamics of mutants in the first
compartments, when the mutation arises in compartment j~1.
Note that for the most biologically plausible case aw0, for large t
the exponential functions in (8) vanish. Thus the mutants will be
washed out from the non stem cell compartments. Thus, the
absence of mutants is a stable state of such hierarchical
compartment structures. However, this equilibrium may not be
of any biological or medical relevance, since the time to get rid of
the last mutant cells of the clone may be longer than the normal
expected lifetime of the healthy organism, cf. Fig. 4. Fig. 3 b) shows
how the maximum of equation (9) and the time to reach it depends
on e, l, and c. As the proliferation rate c of the mutant population
decreases, the size of the mutant population in downstream
compartments increases, although it will take ‘longer’ for the
population to reach high levels. A mutation that increases the net
loss of cells a (either by increasing cell differentiation e or cell death
l) in a compartment lowers the number of mutants at maximum
size of the clone in downstream compartments, which is also
reached earlier. Note also that mutations occurring later in the cell
differentiation process will lead to smaller maxima that vanish
faster [25].
Based on equation (8), other mutant dynamics are also possible.
If ahv0 in a single compartment h, mutant counts diverge
exponentially in all downstream compartments. If ah~0 in a
single compartment h and aw0 otherwise, in the long run mutants
will reach an equilibrium in all downstream compartments, which
is given by

This equilibrium is robust against variations of Ni and thus is a
stable fixed point. However a small change in ah would lead either
to extinction or the divergence of the mutant cell count. For a
more detailed discussion, see Text S1. Initially, the difference
between the dynamics of a clone arising from the stem cell
compartment and an early non stem cell compartment is small, see
Fig. 4.
Mutant extinction times
In the long run the average mutant cell count is given by the
dynamics of the slowest decaying exponential function of equation
(8). It is often natural to assume that this corresponds to the
dynamics in the compartment of the mutant origin j. Thus, if we
assume that ajrjvairi for all iwj (as in the hematopoiesis model in
[1]), in the long run mutants will die out at a rate

stem cell division rate fixes the time scale. Compartments are
continuously filled with cells until they reach the equilibrium.

In Fig. 5 b) we compare the extinction time due to equation (14)
to simulation results. This approximation does not allow to
calculate the extinction time of the mutant of the compartment of
origin, but a more detailed consideration of this case can be
found in [23].
A special case of interest is a mutation with ej~1=2 and lj~0.
This results in a mutant cell that shows stem cell like properties in
compartment j and non stem cell like properties in higher
compartments. In this case the set of differential equations (1a)–
(1c) becomes

the colored dots are due to an individual based stochastic simulation. The corresponding parameters have been chosen from a model of
hematopoiesis [26] (N0~400, e~0:85, l~0 and c~1:26). Averages are over 104
realizations. In the long run, mutants will always be washed out,
because of the missing input from the stem cell pool. However, this process can take a very long time, in our example it would be of the order of 10
years until the average number of mutant cells becomes smaller than one in compartment 6. But it will take significantly longer until all cells in
downstream compartments are washed out. b) Parameter dependence of the maximum. For decreasing e, l and c the maximum number of average
cells increases, but the time to reach this maximum increases. The more differentiated the cell of the origin of the mutation, the lower the maximum
number of cells and the quicker this maximum is reached.

Thus, the average dynamics of such a mutation is exactly as
described above for a stem cell mutation. The averages of the
simulation are described by equation (6) and (8), but a single run is
still stochastic. The relative standard deviation of lower compart-
ments si=Ni is of order 1, but decreases with increasing
compartment number. Stochastic effects on the stem and the
early progenitor cell level are important and can be crucial in a
medical context [14,26], but to understand some fundamental
properties, the deterministic view seems to be sufficient.
Example: Dynamics of PIG-A mutants
Here, we will utilize the model to illustrate the dynamics of a
mutation that is seen in virtually every healthy human being.
Sensitive flow cytometric analysis of circulating blood cells will
identify a small clone that lacks expression of CD55 and CD59
(amongst others) [27]. CD55 and CD59 belong to a class of
proteins that inhibit complement activation and their absence
renders red blood cells sensitive to intravascular destruction. These
proteins are normally displayed on the surface of cells since they
are anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidyl
inositol (GPI) moiety. Synthesis of GPI requires a series of steps.
The PIG-A gene encodes a protein that is an essential component
of the complex responsible for the first step of GPI biosynthesis.
Mutations in this gene can lead to a partial or complete deficiency
of GPI synthesis resulting in low level or complete absence of such
proteins from the cell surface, as for example the complement
inhibitors CD55 and CD59 [28,29]. Red blood cells lacking CD55
and CD59 are destroyed by complement, leading to hemolytic
anemia. As a result, mutations in PIG-A can explain the
phenotype of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), an
acquired hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by
anemia, hemoglobinuria and other manifestations [30]. A recent
mathematical model suggests that a PIG-A mutation in a HSC is
sufficient to explain the incidence and natural history of PNH [31].
However circulating blood cells with the PNH phenotype (due to a
mutation in PIG-A) can be found in virtually every healthy adult
human [27]. Such clones generally disappear with time. With this
background, we will now apply the analytical solution (8), to assess
extinction times of PIG-A mutants and compare these results to in
vivo data derived from healthy adult humans.
The model parameters were fixed to represent hematopoeisis
following [1]. In this approach, cell death is neglected, li~0 for all
i, and an exponentially increasing proliferation rate ri~ci
r0 as
well as a constant differentiation probability ei~e is assumed for
all non stem cell compartments. Further, limited self-renewal is
considered across many stages of differentiation, a prediction that
is finding increasing support. For example, this was noted recently
for cells at the proerythroblast stage, a cell type far removed from
the stem cell or primitive progenitor cell pools [32]. Finally, the
model parameters for human hematopoiesis become N0~400,
r0~1=N0, c~1:26 and e~0:85. The number of cells per
compartment increases exponentially and one needs k&31
compartments [1] to ensure that in a healthy adult human, on
average, the daily bone marrow output is of the order of 3:5:1011
blood cells [33]. The same model can also be fitted to other
mammals [34]. PIG-A mutants are considered to be neutral [35],
supported by in vivo measurments [36,37]. Thus we chose, as for
normal cells, lP~0 and cP~1:26 as mutant parameters. For fully
neutral mutants, the clone would either be present for too much
time or it would not reach the level observed in vivo. We explored
various values of e and found that a slightly lower differentiation
probability eP~0:77 gave the best results. Note that this slight
difference compared to healthy cells is still consistent with the
experimental evidence.
In Araten et al. [27] the blood of 19 healthy adult humans was
sampled and tested for clones with PIG-A mutations. Mutants

where the mutant occurred in the first non stem cell compartment j~1. The dashed blue lines are given by equation (11), extinction occurs when the
average cell count drops below 1. Again the parameters are chosen from a model of hematopoiesis as in Fig. 3 and 4. b) Average extinction time due
to simulation (black dots) and due to equation (14) (dashed blue line). This approximation does not work for the mutant in the compartment of
origin, where an alternative approach is necessary [23].

were found in every person ranging from 8 to 51 mutants per
million (with an average of 21) normal blood cells. Blood samples
from the same patients were taken at later times to determine
survival of these clones. The lower limit of detection in [27] was
approximately 7.5 mutant cells per million. The detected
maximum of 51 mutants per million healthy cells decreased after
164 days and was undetectable after 192 days. Individuals with the
average cell count of 21 PIG-A mutants per million still had the
clone present after 65 days, but it was not detectable after 174
days. We need to determine the compartment j, where a mutation
in PIG-A occurred, such that the clone that arises would grow to
reach the detection threshold and remain detectable for a time
compatible with observations. Using equation (8), we record the
dynamics of mutant cells in compartment 31 for different
compartments of origin. In Fig. 6, the mutant cell count per
healthy cells in compartment 31 is shown, where the mutation
took place in a) compartment 10, b) compartment 11 and c)
compartment 12. With these curves, one can predict extinction
times for different origins of the mutation. Comparing the total
size of the mutant population and the corresponding extinction
times to values obtained in humans [27] allows to predict the
compartments where the mutant clone originated.
In Fig. 6, we show the corresponding times from the
mathematical model calculated from equation (8). The same
figure also illustrates that the time of origin of the mutation can be
much earlier than the detection time. For example, if the mutation
occurred in compartment 10, we predict an extinction time of 230
days for the maximum of 51 mutants per million, when the
initially sample was taken at time t3, see figure 6 a). The extinction
time for the average cell count is 100 days. However, it should be
clear that such mutant cells will survive for significantly longer
than what is detectable by technology due to issues of sensitivity.
With this in mind, there is good agreement between what the
model predicts and the results described in [27], since it is unlikely
that the clones in all the individuals were either found as soon as
they were detectable or when they were at their peak
concentration. Thus what is relevant are (i) the distribution of
times that these mutant cells remain in circulation and (ii) the size
of the clones one observes. In this respect our model provides a
very good approximation of the dynamics of such clones and is
able to infer the cell of origin. If the mutation occurred in earlier
compartments, the clone would be expected to expand to a higher
cell count and will stay in the circulation for a longer time, but
such clones are less likely to occur due to the lower number of
progenitor cells and slower proliferation rate. Mutation events in
higher compartments as j~12 are more likely to happen but these
mutants would not be detectable by most current clinical flow
cytometry techniques due to the small size of such clones in
Figure 6. Dynamics of PIG-A mutants. Panels a) to c) show the number of PIG-A mutants per million healthy cells in compartment k~31, based
on equation (8). The mutation of origin occurred at time t~0 in compartment j~f10,11,12g. The parameters of the mutant cells are cP~1:26,
eP~0:77 and lP~0 in all compartments. The horizontal lines correspond to the detected maximum, the detected average and the detection limit of
PIG-A mutants observed in in vivo studies [27]. The upper table in panel d) shows the time (in days) of these events after the original mutation
occurred at time t~0 based on equation (8). The bottom table shows the corresponding extinction times (Dtl~t6{tl). We predict an extinction time
of 230 days for the measured maximum and 100 days for the average mutant cell count.

compartment 31 although they may be detected perhaps with
polymerase chain reaction technology. Thus, compartments
f10,11,12g are the most likely compartments of the mutant origin
for the cases described in [27]. Mutations arising in these
compartments correspond to mutations in early progenitor cells.
This agrees with the experimental results, since the PNH
phenotype is present in several different cell lineages and thus
has to occur early in the hematopoietic tree. Note that besides the
compartment of origin, the only free parameter is the differenti-
ation probability of mutated cells eP. Here we assumed that these
circulating mutant cells all originate from one founder cell. Two or
more independent, simultaneous or contemporaneous clones in
early compartments would be unlikely [23,38]. If a second
independent mutation occurs during the presence of an earlier
mutant population, the total mutant cell number is the sum of both
single populations, see Text S1 and Figure S1 for more details.
Moreover the hierarchical structure of hematopoiesis provides
an explanation why almost all humans carrying PIG-A mutations
do not have symptoms of PNH. Only mutations in the most
‘primitive’ compartments have an impact and only mutations in a
HSC will lead to disease. In general, one can predict the dynamics
for mutants with very different properties using equation (8). The
compartment of the mutant origin can be inferred if one follows
the mutant count by taking blood samples at regular intervals.
Discussion
In this work, we presented closed analytical solutions for the
deterministic dynamics of stem cell and non stem cell driven
mutants in a multi compartment model of tissues such as
hematopoiesis, the skin and the colon. This enables us to describe
the dynamics of mutant cells in a general approach. We can
predict the time development of a mutant depending on its origin
and its specific proliferation properties. The process of cell
differentiation is conceptually fairly well understood, but it is of
course a challenge to estimate the various parameters in our model
for real systems. Fortunately, very often, simplifying assumptions,
e.g. exponentially increasing cell proliferation rates, can lead to
insights [26]. However, our analytical solution allows us to
incorporate more involved parameter dependencies, which could
immediately be analyzed.
Let us turn to hematopoiesis to address some of the implications
of our model because recent technological developments allow the
detection of well known mutations in many otherwise healthy
people. Perhaps the best examples are derived from blood
disorders, since repeated blood sampling is a minimal invasive
procedure and molecular probes for many blood disorders are
available. The case of PIG-A mutant cells present in healthy
humans has been analyzed extensively in an earlier section. There
are several other specific examples [25].
(i) A mutation in the janus like kinase 2 where phenyalanine
substitutes valine (JAK2V617F) is a common mutation in
patients with chronic myeloid neoplasms. However, one can
find this mutation in a substantial fraction of healthy adults
(perhaps 0.2–0.4 percent) and with an even higher frequency
(0.94 percent) in hospitalized patients who do not have an
overt hematologic disorder [39,40]. JAK2V617F is expected
to give a survival and reproductive advantage to cells, and
probably also enhances self renewal of progenitor cells.
Knowing the dynamics of such clones, can lead to an
understanding of the cell of origin in these patients as well as
its impact on the fitness of mutant cells.
(ii) Finally, the classic oncogene BCR-ABL [41] that is
associated with chronic myeloid leukemia can be found in
healthy adults [42]. In some of these individuals the mutant
clone resolves while in others it persists but to our
knowledge, none of the individuals in the cohort described
have progressed to develop CML. There are various
potential explanations for this observation including (i)
non-stem cell origin of the mutant clone, (ii) stochastic
extinction [14], (iii) immune response to the clone, (iv)
additional mutations may be needed to lead to CML.
Independent of the multitude of possibilities, it is safe to
conclude that the cell of origin of a mutant is of importance
and the impact of a mutation is cell context dependent. Our
model can provide plausible explanations for the frequency
and cell of origin of these mutations and perhaps why they
do not lead to disease.
(iii) We can also think of other mutations altering cell division
properties. For instance, one can consider a mutation
occurring in compartment j with ej~1=2, lj~0 and normal
properties in all the other upstream compartments. This
would be the special case described by equation (16), and
can be understood as a mutation that enables a cell to
reacquire stem cell-like renewal capacities again. Such a
behavior can explain the origin of various subtypes of acute
leukemia as has been reported recently [43–45].
Our model provides a mathematical abstraction of hierarchi-
cally structured tissues and neglects many factors that can have an
important impact on the dynamics, as for example spatial
population structure or temporal changes of cell division
properties, e.g. due to aging or injury. Nonetheless, the most
important aspects of such tissue structures are captured by our
model. It takes the form of ordinary differential equations that
allows analytical solutions in many cases. An alternative would be
a numerical solution, but such a solution has to be implemented
for specific sets of parameters. We are convinced that our model
can readily be applied to various hierarchical tissues and expect
that general features of mutant dynamics will be conserved across
different tissues.
