INTRODUCTION
Secondary iron-overload causes various complications,
such as liver cirrhosis, diabetes, and heart failure [1]. In
Western countries, much experience has been accu-
mulated with regard to chronic refractory anemia and its
complications because of the high prevalence of
thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. The survival of

ORIGINAL ARTICLE
Background/Aims: The financial burden of caring for iron-related complications (IRCs) is an emerging medical
problem in Korea, as in Western countries. We produced a preliminary estimate of the costs of treating patients
for IRCs.
Methods: The medical records of patients who had received multiple transfusions were reviewed. Newly
developed cardiomyopathy, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer were defined as IRCs.
The costs of laboratory studies, medication, oxygenation, intervention, and education were calculated using
working criteria we defined. Costs that had a definite causal relationship with IRCs were included to produce as
accurate an estimate as possible.
Results: Between 2002 and 2006, 650 patients with hematologic diseases, including 358 with acute leukemia,
102 with lymphoma, 58 with myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative disease, 46 with multiple myeloma,
and 31 with chronic leukemia, received more than 10 units of red blood cells. Nine patients developed IRCs. The
primary diagnoses of eight patients were aplastic anemia and that of one patient was chronic lymphocytic
leukemia. Two patients who had diabetes were excluded because one was treated at another hospital and the
other was diagnosed as oxymetholone-induced diabetes. Of the seven patients included, liver cirrhosis
developed in two, heart failure in four, and diabetes mellitus in three. Some of them had two diagnoses. The total
cost attributed to IRCs for the seven patients was 47,388,241 KRW (approximately 50,000 USD).
Conclusions: The medical costs of IRCs are considerable, and more effective iron-chelating therapy is
necessary to save medical resources and improve patient care. More in the way of comprehensive health and
economic studies of IRCs are needed to allow both clinicians and health-policy makers to make better decisions.

patients with thalassemia major has improved markedly,
but the prevalence of severe complications such as heart
failure, arrhythmias, and diabetes is still high.
In Korea, iron-related complications (IRCs) have not
been a matter of concern. Patients with aplastic anemia or
myelodysplastic syndrome can now live for a long time
with supportive and curative treatments, including
judicious blood transfusion and stem cell transplantation.
Therefore, comprehensive studies of their secondary iron
overload and its complications are needed. Consequently,
we analyzed the medical costs of patients treated for IRCs
at our institution.
METHODS
We searched the database of Seoul National University
Blood Bank for patients transfused with more than ten
units from 2002 to 2006. Their electronic medical records
were reviewed to find patients with IRCs. The cost data for
IRCs could be retrieved from electronic medical records
for patients from 2002, when this records system was
adopted at the hospital. The medical costs in the
emergency room were included as either inpatient or
outpatient costs. We defined items to assess the medical
costs of IRCs, as described in Table 1.
Specific tools were developed for calculating the costs
of IRCs.
If the main cause of admission was IRCs, all medical
costs were included (e.g., the costs for inotropics and
diuretics used to treat dyspnea due to heart failure). If the
main cause of admission was not IRCs, medical costs that
had a definite causal relationship were included. For
example, if a patient with cholecystitis was treated for
heart failure during the admission, only the costs of the
care for heart failure were included. Outpatient costs were
calculated in the same way as inpatient costs. Cardio-
myopathy, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis
and liver cancer were defined as IRCs. Charges for
diagnostic studies, medication and intervention were
included. In the cases with cardiomyopathy and heart
failure, charges for studies such as echocardiography and
electrocardiography were included. Charges for inotropics
(epinephrine, dopamine, dobutamine, digoxin, etc.),
diuretics (furosemide, spironolactone, etc.), angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors (ramipril, enalapril, etc.)
and inhaled oxygen were included as charges for
medication and intervention. Charges for intravenous
fluids and catheters were excluded. In the cases with
diabetes mellitus, charges for fasting blood sugar, post
prandial blood sugar, C-peptide and ophthalmologic
examinations were included as charges for diagnostic
studies. Costs for insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents,
education, costs of treating any complications related to
diabetes were included. In the cases with liver cirrhosis
and liver cancer, charges for ultrasonography, computed
tomography, liver function tests, alphafetoprotein,
hepatotonics, vitamins, ascites drainage and transarterial
chemoembolization were included.
Costs with vague causal relationships to IRCs were
excluded. Complications that have complex etiologies
were also excluded. IRCs included cardiomyopathy, heart
failure, diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer
because they have definite causal relationships with iron
overload. Infection is a known complication of iron
overload, but infection-related costs were excluded
because infection can also be a consequence of an
immuno-compromised state due to underlying diseases.

Strict criteria were applied for additional costs associated
with IRCs. Costs for routine follow-up, treatment of
underlying disease or iron overload itself were excluded
(e.g., routine laboratory tests, serum ferritin, and defe-
roxamine administration). Costs in other departments for
treating IRCs were excluded from the analysis (e.g., stroke
with diabetes).
RESULTS
Between 2002 and 2006, 650 patients with various
hematologic diseases, including 358 with acute leukemia,
102 with lymphoma, 58 with myelodysplastic syndrome
or myeloproliferative disease, 31 with chronic leukemia,
and 46 with multiple myeloma, were transfused more
than 10 units of red blood cells. Nine patients who
developed IRCs were studied for the cost analysis. The
primary diagnoses of eight patients were aplastic anemia
and that of one patient was chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Two patients with aplastic anemia who had diabetes were
excluded because one patient was treated at another
hospital and the other was diagnosed with oxymetholone-
induced diabetes. Table 2 shows the basic characteristics
of the patients included and their medical costs related to
IRCs. Liver cirrhosis developed in two, heart failure in
four, and diabetes in three patients. The total cost for the
seven patients was 47,388,241 KRW (approximately
50,000 USD).
DISCUSSION
One large retrospective study in Italy showed that
transfusion dependency and secondary iron overload have
a significant impact on survival in myelodysplastic
syndromes [2]. In an era of rising medical costs, cost-
benefit problems are at the center of public attention in
medical decision-making. The quality and quantity of life
achieved by medical interventions are difficult to measure
in purely financial terms. Many patients suffer because of
the medical expenses they incur, in addition to the
diseases that afflict them. In particular, recent advances in
hematology and medical oncology have forced patients
and physicians to balance the benefits and expenses of
medical treatment. In Western countries, cost analyses of
IRCs and iron-chelating agents are actively being con-
ducted. In one analysis involving 31 thalassemia patients
in America, IRCs were a major cost determinant and
medical expenses increased sharply with the number of
complications [3]. A lack of compliance with chelating
therapy was associated with IRCs and high mortality [4,5].
Efforts to improve compliance with iron-chelating therapy
might decrease the rate of IRCs and consequently lower
the medical expenses.
Medical care costs for IRCs are now a matter of concern
in Korea, since patients with refractory anemia from
various causes live longer with the advances that have
been made in therapeutic measures. Effective iron-
chelating therapy with deferoxamine is difficult because of
its inconvenience and poor compliance. Recently, oral
iron-chelators (deferasirox and deferiprone), which are
thought to be more accessible to patients who do not

tolerate the parenteral route, were developed as an
alternative [6,7]. Nevertheless, the use of oral iron
chelators increases medical costs. If the seven patients in
this study had received deferasirox from the date of the
primary diagnosis until the end of follow-up, the total cost
for the iron-chelating therapy would be 3,027,299,612
KRW. One recent study compared the cost-effectiveness
of two iron chelators: deferasirox and deferoxamine. They
used a Markov model to estimate quality-adjusted life
years (QALY). The oral chelating agent deferasirox
resulted in a gain of 4.5 QALY per patient at an additional
expected lifetime cost of 126,018 USD per patient [8].
Our study revealed the considerable costs for IRCs in
patients with hematologic diseases. We used strict criteria
and ignored any costs related to a potential loss of social
activity. More in the way of comprehensive health and
economic studies of IRCs are needed for informed
decision-making by patients, clinicians, and health policy
makers.
