Abstract
Patients on systemic glucocorticoids for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after hematopoietic
cell transplant are susceptible to invasive fungal infections (IFI), which greatly contribute to
morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the efficacy of prophylactic treatment options
(voriconazole versus fluconazole or itraconazole) for IFI by performing a retrospective review of
patients on glucocorticoids for GVHD given voriconazole (n = 97), fluconazole (n = 36), or
itraconazole (n = 36). IFI developed in 7/72 (10%) patients on fluconazole/itraconazole versus
2/97 (2%) on voriconazole (P = 0.03) within the first 100 days of glucocorticoids. Five patients
developed Aspergillus IFI on fluconazole/itraconazole (7%), compared to none on voriconazole
(0%) (P = 0.008); Aspergillus IFI resulted in death in all 5 patients. We found that IFI occurred in
patients who received an initial dose of at least 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent; when the
analysis was restricted to these patients, the hazard ratio (0.39; 95% confidence interval: 0.08–
1.86) was consistent with a protective effect of voriconazole compared with fluconazole/
itraconazole, although this subset analysis did not reach significance. Overall survival at 100 days
after start of glucocorticoids was 77% in patients given fluconazole/itraconazole and 85% in those
given voriconazole (P = 0.22). Our results suggest that voriconazole is more effective than
fluconazole/itraconazole in preventing IFI, especially aspergillosis, in patients receiving
glucocorticoids posttransplant.

immunity, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are established risk factors for IFI.1, 2 The
incidence of IFI after allogeneic HCT ranges from 19% to 32%.3–5 Because of the
significant risk of IFI after allogeneic HCT, several antifungal agents have been studied in
the prophylactic setting. Fluconazole prophylaxis reduced the incidence of IFI and improved
survival in patients who had allogeneic HCT, as reported in prospective randomized studies.
6–9 In other randomized studies, itraconazole failed to show protection from IFI, and many
patients discontinued itraconazole early due to poor tolerance.10, 11
Prophylactic strategies have been studied specifically in patients treated with glucocorticoids
for GVHD. In one prospective randomized investigation, Ullmann et al12 reported non-
inferiority of posaconazole compared to fluconazole. Posaconazole was also superior in
preventing invasive aspergillosis and reducing mortality from IFI. However, posaconazole is
available only as an oral formulation, and the bioavailability is variable based on whether it
is administered in a fasting state. A concern in patients with GVHD is whether oral
absorption is compromised due to poor oral intake, vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in
intestinal mucosa secondary to GVHD.
Voriconazole is available in both oral and intravenous formulations.13–15 Voriconazole is
well-tolerated, with more predictable oral bioavailability. After FDA approval in 2002, we
began using voriconazole as standard antifungal prophylaxis in patients receiving
glucocorticoid therapy for GVHD, replacing fluconazole or itraconazole in this setting. This
change was made because of the superior activity of voriconazole against aspergillus
compared to fluconazole, as well as the improved tolerability relative to itraconazole. To
evaluate the relative efficacy of voriconazole, we performed a single-center retrospective
review and recorded the development of IFI in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy for
GVHD along with antifungal prophylaxis using either voriconazole, itraconazole, or
fluconazole.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
This study and corresponding waiver of informed consent were approved by the University
of South Florida Institutional Review Board.
Records of consecutive patients who received allogeneic HCT at the Moffitt Cancer Center
from 6/1/1996 to 12/31/2006 were reviewed. Patients were included if they received
fluconazole beginning the day of transplant, developed GVHD, and were treated with at
least 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone (or equivalent). Patients were excluded if they were on
systemic antifungal therapies other than fluconazole immediately before glucocorticoid
initiation or if they had a history of IFI. Patients were divided into two groups based on
antifungal prophylaxis given at the time of glucocorticoid initiation: those receiving either
fluconazole (400 mg daily orally or intravenously) or itraconazole (200 mg twice daily
orally or 200 mg daily intravenously) or those receiving voriconazole (200 mg twice daily
orally or intravenously). For patients who received subsequent infusions of donor cells
(including donor lymphocyte infusions and second transplants), only the first transplant
period was included for analysis. Data were censored at the time of second donor cell
infusion and at the time of relapse.
The predefined primary study endpoint was the proportion of proven or probable IFI that
occurred within 100 days from initiation of glucocorticoid therapy. A study period of 100
days was chosen to ensure consistent follow-up, as many of our patients return to local
health care providers after that period. Proven or probable IFI was defined per European
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria.16
Secondary endpoints were cumulative incidence of IFI (with relapse or death due to other

causes considered competing risks), IFI-related mortality, and overall survival at 100 days
after initiation of glucocorticoids.
We hypothesized that prophylaxis with voriconazole would reduce the incidence of IFI from
20% to 5%. Using a two-sided test of equal proportions with alpha = 0.05, we required a
sample size of 76 patients in each group to have a power of 80%. To assess statistical
significance of the differences in patient characteristics, the exact unconditional test was
used for 2 × 2 tables; for larger contingency tables, the exact Fisher exact test was used.
Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for differences in various proportions were tested
by the unconditional test, and all calculations were performed using StatXact version 7
(Cytel, Cambridge, MA). Probabilities for overall survival and IFI-free survival were
calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimation. Survival curves were compared using the log-
rank test, and Cox regression was used for multivariate analysis. Proportional hazard
regression modeling by Fine and Gray was used in the univariate analyses. Cumulative
incidence curves were generated based on the life-table method17 and compared using the
method of Gray.18
RESULTS
Four hundred and forty-eight patients received allogeneic HCT at the Moffitt Cancer Center
from 7/1/1996 to 12/31/2006. Of these, 169 patients were eligible for this study (Table 1).
Seventy-two patients received either fluconazole (n = 36) or itraconazole (n = 36), and 97
patients received voriconazole. Patients on voriconazole were older, more likely to have
received peripheral blood hematopoietic cells from unrelated donors, and were treated more
recently with fludarabine-based conditioning regimens. The initial glucocorticoid dose was
lower in the patients who received voriconazole, but there was no difference in the initial
grade of GVHD between the two groups.
Proven or probable IFI developed in 7 of 72 patients (10%) on fluconazole/itraconazole
versus 2 of 97 (2%) on voriconazole (unconditional test P =0.03; 95% confidence interval
for the difference in proportions: 1% to 17%). All infections occurred while the patients
were still receiving the designated antifungal prophylactic medication. The cumulative
incidence of IFI from start of glucocorticoid therapy is shown in Figure 1; at 100 days after
start of glucocorticoid therapy, the cumulative incidence was 10% for the fluconazole/
itraconazole group and 2% for the voriconazole group (P = 0.029). Two patients on
fluconazole and three patients on itraconazole developed Aspergillus IFI (7%): 4 with
pneumonia (A. flavus, A. terreus, A. fungoides and 1 not speciated) and 1 with skin abscess
(A. ustus). However, no patients on voriconazole developed Aspergillus IFI (P=0.008;
confidence interval for the difference in proportions: 3% to 16%). Two patients (3%)
developed candidemia (Candida krusei and C. glabrata) on fluconazole, and 2 patients (2%)
developed candidemia (C. glabrata) on voriconazole (P = 0.83; confidence interval for the
difference in proportions:–5% to 8%). No patient developed an infection due to
Zygomycoses within the study period. Treatment for IFI was chosen by the individual
treating physician, and this information was not collected as part of this study.
Mortality from IFI within 100 days of the start of glucocorticoid therapy was 5 of 72 (7%)
on fluconazole/itraconazole and 0 of 97 (0%) on voriconazole (P = 0.008; confidence
interval for the difference in proportions: 3% to 16%). All 5 patients who developed
aspergillosis died as a result of the infection. Survival without IFI at 100 days after start of
glucocorticoid therapy was 75% in the fluconazole/itraconazole group and 85% in the
voriconazole group (P = 0.10). Overall survival at 100 days after start of glucocorticoid
therapy was 77% for patients on fluconazole/itraconazole and 85% for patients on
voriconazole (P = 0.22).

All occurrences of IFI were in patients who received an initial dose of glucocorticoids of ≥2
mg/kg/day. Among this subset, 7 of 45 patients (16%) on fluconazole/itraconazole
developed IFI compared to 2 of 31 patients (6%) on voriconazole (P = 0.27; confidence
interval for the difference in proportions: –9% to 24%). Aspergillosis occurred in 5 of 45
patients (11%) on fluconazole/itraconazole compared to 0 of 31 patients on voriconazole (P
= 0.06; confidence interval for the difference in proportions: –1 to 24%). In our evaluation
of the differences between characteristics in this subgroup of patients, patients on
voriconazole were still more likely to have received peripheral blood (90% versus 18% in
the fluconazole/itraconazole group) from unrelated donors (66% versus 29% in the
fluconazole/itraconazole group). The voriconazole-treated patients were also more likely to
have had more severe GVHD at initial diagnosis (data not shown). The combination of these
characteristics would have put the patients at higher risk for IFI.
Table 2 shows univariate analyses of IFI for all patients, and Table 3 shows results limited to
those patients who received at least 2 mg/kg/day of glucocorticoid therapy. Prophylaxis with
voriconazole was significantly protective in all patients (hazard ratio: 0.2; 95% confidence
interval: 0.04−0.97). There was suggestion of a similar protective effect when the analysis
was restricted to those patients who received higher doses of glucocorticoids (hazard ratio:
0.39; 95% confidence interval: 0.08−1.86), but the comparison with smaller numbers of
patients was not significant. The relative impact of other patient characteristics could not be
assessed in a multivariate analysis due to the small number of informative cases.
DISCUSSION
These results suggest that voriconazole is effective antifungal prophylaxis in patients
receiving at least 1 mg/kg/day of glucocorticoids for treatment of GVHD. The incidence of
proven or probable IFI in our series is comparable to that shown in the report by Ullmann et
al in a similar population.12 In that study, the incidence of any IFI in patients receiving
posaconazole was 5.3% (incidence of invasive aspergillosis = 2.3%). This compares to 2%
and 0%, respectively, in our series. Our results in the comparator group (fluconazole/
itraconazole) are also consistent with the findings of Ullmann et al in their fluconazole
group: 9% and 7% for IFI and aspergillosis, respectively. In addition, mortality associated
with IFI was also comparable to that seen by Ullmann et al. This suggests that voriconazole
may be as effective as posaconazole in this setting, a hypothesis that would require a
prospective evaluation in order to confirm.
A limitation of retrospective evaluations is the change in practice patterns over time. The
two groups differed with respect to age, conditioning regimen intensity, donor source,
hematopoietic stem cell source, and initial dose of glucocorticoids used to treat acute
GVHD. These differences are reflective of the changes that have occurred in the field of
hematopoietic cell transplantation with the use of less intensive conditioning, especially in
older patients, peripheral blood becoming the more common source of hematopoietic cells
for patients with advanced disease, the increasing availability of HLA-compatible unrelated
donors, and the use of lower doses of glucocorticoids for patients with acute GVHD. Three
of these factors (age, disease risk, and unrelated donor grafts) are risk factors for IFI,19–21
which would bias treatment effect in favor of the fluconazole/itraconazole group because
they were younger, had lower risk disease, and were more likely to have received transplants
from related donors. Novel antifungal therapies have also become available over time that
could have influenced the comparison of IFI-related mortality. All of the incidences of IFI in
this series occurred in patients who received an initial glucocorticoid dose of at least 2 mg/
kg/day, suggesting an increased risk of IFI with higher doses of glucocorticoids. Other
investigators have also shown this association.19–21 The voriconazole group was more
likely to have received lower doses of glucocorticoids, which would bias the treatment effect

in its favor. However, when the analysis was restricted to those patients who received at
least 2 mg/kg/day of glucocorticoids, the hazard ratio (0.39; 95% confidence interval:
0.08−1.86) was consistent with a protective effect of voriconazole compared to fluconazole/
itraconazole, although the subset analysis did not reach significance. The relative impact of
other patient characteristics could not be assessed in a multivariate analysis due to the small
number of informative cases.
Voriconazole has been compared to fluconazole as prophylaxis beginning in the immediate
posttransplant setting in a large, prospective, randomized, double-blind trial.22 In that trial,
the cumulative rates of proven, probable, and presumptive IFI were not statistically different
in the two arms at 6 months: 10.6% in the fluconazole arm and 6.6% in the voriconazole
arm. These proportions are higher than those that we observed, likely due to the inclusion of
presumptive infections and longer follow up (6 months versus 100 days) in the prospective
study. Microbiologically documented Aspergillus infections were significantly less frequent
in the voriconazole-treated patients, as seen in our series.
In this series, more recently transplanted patients being treated with high-dose
glucocorticoid therapy for GVHD appeared to be at a lower risk of developing IFI than in
the past. Many factors may have contributed to this lower risk, including the use of reduced
intensity conditioning and lower doses of corticosteroids. This retrospective analysis also
suggested that giving voriconazole as prophylaxis in this setting had a beneficial effect
compared to fluconazole or itraconazole in preventing IFI, especially aspergillosis. A
randomized prospective trial would be required to confirm these results.
