INTRODUCTION
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from
HLA-matched or unrelated donors has a high curative poten-
tial in various hematologic diseases. ABO antigens are inher-
ited independently from the HLA antigen complex (1). Major
ABO incompatibility means the recipient has isoagglutinin
capable of reacting with ABO antigens on the surface of donor
red cells. It has been known that approximately 15 to 20 per-
cent of stem cell recipients have a major ABO incompatibility
with their donors, yet ABO incompatible stem cell transplan-
tation has not previously been proven to be associated with
decreased survival (2, 3).
However, the graft stem cell product contains donor type
red cells approximately the same volume as a unit of whole
blood. The red cell mass transfused is sufficient to precipitate
a severe hemolytic reaction at the time of their infusion. Hemol-
ysis at graft infusion may be avoided by red cell or plasma
depletion of the graft (4) or by in vivo depletion of recipient
isoagglutinin (5, 6).
In addition to the risk of acute hemolysis at the time of infu-
sion of the donor stem cells, major ABO incompatible stem
cell transplantation carries the potential risks of delayed onset
of hemolysis and delayed onset of erythropoiesis (7, 8), result-
ing in prolonged transfusion dependency and increased red
cell transfusion requirement. The engrafted stem cells contin-
ue to produce the donor type red cells and these incompatible
red cells substantiate the risk of delayed hemolytic reactions.
Thus we hypothesized that the risk of delayed hemolysis in
major ABO incompatible stem cell transplantation could be
reduced with the suppression of graft erythropoiesis while
recipient isoagglutinin remained at a significant titer.
To further suppress graft erythropoiesis, we performed hyper-
transfusion. Hypertransfusion is a technique used for patients
with thalassemia syndrome, based on the reduction of erythro-
poiesis and evidenced by the decreased number of reticulocytes
(9). This study examined a variety of factors to confirm whether
we could reduce the risk of hemolysis with hypertransfusion.

The Outcomes of Hypertransfusion in Major ABO Incompatible
Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation
Major ABO incompatibility may be potentially associated with immediate or delayed
hemolysis and delayed onset of erythropoiesis in patients receiving allogeneic he-
matopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). To determine if hemolysis can be pre-
vented by the inhibition of graft erythropoiesis, we performed hypertransfusion and
assessed red cell transfusion requirement and independence. Between October 1995
and December 2001, 28 consecutive patients receiving major ABO incompatible
HSCT at Samsung Medical Center were hypertransfused to maintain their hemoglobin
levels at 15 g/dL or more. We retrospectively compared the outcomes of these patients
with those of 47 patients at Asan Medical Center whose target hemoglobin levels
were 10 g/dL. Reticulocyte engraftment was significantly delayed in hypertransfused
group (51 days vs. 23 days; p= .001). There was no significant difference in the total
amount of red cells transfused within 90 days post-HSCT (25 units vs. 26 units; p=
.631). No significant difference in the time to red cell transfusion independence was
observed between the two groups (63 days vs. 56 days; p=.165). In conclusion, we
failed to improve red cell transfusion requirement and independence in major ABO
incompatible HSCT with hypertransfusion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
Between October 1995 and December 2001, 28 consecutive
adult patients receiving major ABO incompatible (including
bi-directional and pure major ABO mismatches) allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at Samsung Medical
Center were hypertransfused to maintain their hemoglobin
levels at 15 g/dL or more. Hypertransfusion continued until
their isoagglutinin titers became 1:8 or less. We retrospective-
ly compared the outcomes of these hypertransfused patients
with those of 47 patients at Asan Medical Center whose tar-
get hemoglobin levels were 10 g/dL.
All patients received white cell-depleted and irradiated group
O red cells. ABO compatible platelets were given preferen-
tially if available. Graft stem cells were infused after red cell
depletion using a cell separator (COBE-2991 cell processor,
COBE BCT, Lakewood, CO) in both centers. All patients were
nursed in the single isolation room with laminar air filter.
Outcomes
Complete blood counts with differential and reticulocyte
counts were measured daily starting 7 days before transplan-
tation until sustained hematopoietic engraftment was achieved,
then at least weekly until day 100, and from then biweekly
up to 1 yr. Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies were performed
on days 35, 100, 180 and 365 after transplantation. The titers
of anti-A and anti-B isoagglutinins were evaluated before the
conditioning regimen was begun, then weekly until stable
red cell engraftment was achieved.
Hemolysis could be manifested by a sudden drop in hemo-
globin of 1.0 g/dL or more without any evidence of bleeding,
increases in bilirubin and lactic dehydrogenase, and decreases
in serum haptoglobin concentrations. However, it was difficult
to evaluate precisely the incidence of hemolysis using above
findings because a variety of complications related to stem cell
transplantation such as bleeding, infections, veno-occlusive
disease, drug effects, or graft versus host disease mimicked the
manifestations of hemolysis. Therefore, we indirectly compared
the results of our study group with those of the control group
in terms of the red cell transfusion requirements and the dura-
tion of red cell transfusion dependence. The duration of red
cell transfusion dependence was defined as the number of days
from the transplantation to the last red cell transfusion that
was followed by 30 days without transfusion.
We also evaluated the time to trilineage engraftments and
post transplant day 100 survival. The time of red cell engraft-
ment was defined as the first day on which their reticulocyte
count of 1 percent or more was achieved for at least 2 consec-
utive days. We defined the time of granulocyte and platelet
engraftments as the first day on which absolute granulocyte
count of 500/ L or more was achieved for at least 3 consecu-
tive days and the first day on which platelet count of 20,000/
L or more was achieved for at least 7 consecutive days without
platelet transfusion, respectively.
Pure red cell aplasia was diagnosed when red cell engraftment
was not achieved and day 365 bone marrow biopsy showed
isolated depletion of erythroid precursors, following the exclu-
sion of red cell alloantibodies, viral or bacterial infection, or
relapse.
Statistical Analysis
From the preliminary data of our hospital, recipients with
major ABO incompatibility were transfused a median of 16.5
units of red cells by day 100 post transplant, whereas recipi-
ents of ABO compatible stem cell transplantation received
10.4 units of red cells. These data showed that the amount of
transfusedredcellsconformedtolognormaldistribution.There-
fore, we were hoping to decrease the red cell transfusion require-
ment in the recipients of ABO incompatible hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation from 16.5 units down to 10.4 units
with hypertransfusion. Assuming the significance level of 0.05
and the power of 0.8, we needed 27 patients.
The association between categorical variables were evaluated
using the chi-square test or, if appropriate, the two-sided Fish-
er’s exact test. Continuous variables were expressed as median
and range, and compared using Mann-Whitney test, if indi-
cated. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
All analyses were done using SPSS 10.0 software.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Twenty-eight patients were assigned to the hypertransfu-
sion group, and 47 patients to the control group. Detailed
clinical characteristics of these patients are summarized in
Table 1. The pre-transplant characteristics of the two groups
were essentially similar with respect to age, sex, primary dis-
ease, type of donors, and the duration of follow-up. Condition-
ing and graft versus host disease prophylaxis regimens were
allowed to be different between the two groups, according to
the physician’s preference.
Outcomes
As we had expected, red cell engraftment was significantly
delayed with hypertransfusion (51 days in the hypertransfusion
group versus 23 days in the control group; p=0.001). During
the first 30 days post transplant, significantly more red cells
were transfused in the hypertransfusion group (16±7.63 units
versus 10±6.13 units; p<0.001). However, there was no sig-
nificant difference in the total amount of red cells transfused
within the first 90 days (25±12.58 units versus 26±36.56
Hypertransfusion for ABO Incompatible HSCT 81
units; p=0.631) (Table 2).
The median duration of the red cell transfusion dependence
was 63 days in the hypertransfusion group and 56 days in the
control group. No significant difference was observed (p=
0.165).
Granulocyte (16 days versus 20 days; p=0.052) and platelet
(24 days versus 27 days; p=0.051) engraftments inclined to
be faster in the hypertransfusion group, but the p values failed
to show any significances.
Comparable day 100 post transplant survival was noted (79
percent versus 87 percent; p=0.322). We evaluated the inci-
dence of pure red cell aplasia at 365 days post transplant and
failed to observe any significant difference (14 percent versus
17 percent; p=0.513).
Evidences of hemolysis were evaluated only in the hypertrans-
fusion group, because we found it difficult to evaluate the man-
ifestations of hemolysis in the control group retrospectively.
Hemolysis occurred in 46 percent of the patients receiving
hypertransfusion.
DISCUSSION
Among patients receiving major ABO incompatible allo-
geneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, red cell engraft-
ment was delayed with hypertransfusion. However, more red
cell transfusion was not required and the duration of red cell
transfusion dependence was not prolonged with hypertrans-
fusion.
In a retrospective analysis of 292 allogeneic stem cell trans-
plantation recipients, Benjamin and his colleagues reported
that ABO incompatibility resulted in a significantly greater
risk of death within 100 days of transplant and delayed onset
of red cell engraftment (7). Recipients with major ABO incom-
patibility received more red cell transfusion during their post-
transplant period. Worel et al. also reported of delayed red
cell engraftment and significantly decreased day 100 survival
in the recipients of major ABO incompatible stem cell trans-
plantation (8). However, still there are controversies whether
major ABO incompatibility adversely affects clinical outcomes
of transplant recipients (10-12). Major ABO incompatible
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has poten-
tial immunohematologic complications such as a delay in the
onset of erythropoiesis, acute hemolysis at the time of stem cell
infusion, or delayed onset of hemolysis associated with persis-
tence of anti-A and/or anti-B after transplantation. Delayed
onset of hemolytic reaction stems from the infused red cells
of donor type or red cells produced by the engrafted donor
stem cells. With the depletion of red cells in graft stem cell
product, we could avoid or reduce hemolysis at the time of
stem cell infusion. However, it is still evident that the risk of
delayed onset of hemolysis is caused by red cells produced by
engrafted donor stem cells.
Delayed onset of hemolysis in patients receiving transplan-
tation with red cell depleted stem cell products is rather unex-
pected since the only source of significant volumes of incom-
patible red cells would be erythropoiesis by the newly engraft-
ed stem cells unless red cell transfusions of donor type are used

in the post-transplant period (13). Nevertheless, Sniecinski
et al. reported that 5 out of 58 evaluable patients developed
overt evidence of delayed hemolysis (1). We also observed that
no fewer than 46 percent of the patients developed evidence
of delayed onset of hemolysis in this study.
We started this trial in order to prove the hypothesis that
hemolytic complications of major ABO incompatible stem
cell transplantation would be reduced with hypertransfusion.
It is of note that there was no increase in the total amount of
transfused red cells with target hemoglobin level of 15 g/dL.
We observed that the red cell transfusion dependence was not
prolonged with hypertransfusion. We are not sure whether this
is the case, whether it was clinically significant, and whether
this might have been due to a reduction in later hemolytic
complications.
We do admit this trial has some weaknesses. We failed to
compare the overt evidence of hemolysis between the 2 groups.
In addition, it is very difficult in allogeneic transplant patients
to define a hemolytic event as one manifested by hemoglobin
falling ≥1 g/dL in the absence of bleeding with an increase
in bilirubin and/or LDH and decrease in serum haptoglobin.
All these variables may change for a number of reasons uncon-
nected with hemolysis. Evaluation of the patients who were
assigned to the control group was performed retrospectively.
There were differences in the type of conditioning regimen
and the type of graft versus host disease prophylaxis, even if
red cell transfusion requirements and the occurrence of pure
red cell aplasia were functions of the type of conditioning reg-
imen and of graft versus host disease prophylaxis. In conclu-
sion, we failed to improve red cell transfusion requirement
and independence in major ABO incompatible hematopoi-
etic stem cell transplantation with hypertransfusion.
