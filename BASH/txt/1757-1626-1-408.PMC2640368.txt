Abstract
Background: Weakness and fatigue are accepted as normal accompaniments of aging. Usually,
older individuals are not investigated with much enthusiasm but a treatable cause is discernible on
several occasions.
Case presentation: We had a 67 year old hypertensive lady with a mitral stenosis, presenting in
ischemic or hypertensive heart failure with underlying valvular disease, without pulmonary
hypertension in sinus rhythm. She had pancytopenia with severe anemia and raised liver enzymes.
Bone marrow examination showed aplastic anemia. She was treated with ATG and improved
subsequently to become transfusion free. However, she succumbed to an unrelated sudden cardiac
death.
Conclusion: Our patient is unique in her uncommon presentation, complex management issues
and a favorable outcome after a long and persevering therapeutic intervention and finally her
sudden death.
Case report
In December, 2007 a 67 year old hypertensive lady, with
a known rheumatic mitral stenosis, presented with insidi-
ous onset, gradually progressive fatigue of one month,
which had decompensated acutely. There was no history
of peptic ulcer, use of NSAIDs or change in bowel habits.
She had no previous blood transfusions or jaundice. She
denied smoking or taking alcohol. There was no sugges-
tion of long standing liver or kidney disease, diarrhea or
infection. She took amlodipine and atenolol for hyperten-
sion. There was no history of intake of any other drugs
that could have had a toxic potential.
She was pale, anicteric, normotensive and tachypneic with
pulse of 100/minute. Her neck veins were engorged and
she had pedal edema. She was afebrile, did not have any
clubbing, and had no signs of rheumatic activity or infec-
tive endocarditis. She had a loud first heart sound, a nor-
mal second heart sound, an opening snap and a mid-
diastolic murmur at apex. She had a resonant percussion
note, equal air entry, and vesicular breath sounds on both
sides. Coarse rales were heard in the infrascapular and
infraaxillary areas. She had an enlarged tender, firm liver
with sharp margins and a span of 10 cms. No splenomeg-
aly or ascites were noted. Here, we had an old hyperten-

sive lady with a mitral stenosis, presenting in ischemic or
hypertensive heart failure with underlying valvular dis-
ease, without pulmonary hypertension, rheumatic activity
or infective endocarditis in sinus rhythm. An infective
pathology causing acute deterioration or a pulmonary
embolism was also considered.
Her hemoglobin was 65 g/L, TLC 3.2 × 109/L with abso-
lute neutrophils count of 1.6 × 109/L, platelet count of 43
× 109/L and MCV 110 fL (see figure 1). Macrocytosis,
hypochromia, leukopenia and reduced platelets but no
abnormal cells were seen. Blood cultures were sterile. She
had raised serum bilirubin (2 mg/dL) and liver enzymes
(SGPT 877 and SGOT 1179 IU). Serology for hepatitis
virus A, B, C, E and HIV was negative. Coombs test and
antinuclear antibodies were negative. Serum vitamin B12
level was 896 pg/ml.
Echocardiography showed mild mitral stenosis (MVOA
1.8 sqcm) with normal left ventricular ejection fraction,
and no signs of infective endocarditis. Serum and urine
electrophoresis did not detect any abnormal bands. Bone
marrow biopsy from the iliac crest showed profound
hypoplasia with overall cellularity of less than 5%. She
had osteoporosis with a bone mineral density of 0.714 g/
sqcm. Her liver function tests rapidly returned to normal
levels.
She was given immunosuppression with anti-thymocyte
globulin at the dose of 40 mg/kg daily for 4 days along
with prednisolone at 1 mg/kg tapered over 3 weeks. This
was followed by cyclosporine at the dose of 10 mg/kg/
day. The patient continued to need regular and frequent
blood and component transfusion support for ten more
weeks. The profile of her hematological parameters over
this period is reflected in table 1. When seen in April, she
was doing well and had been transfusion free for three
weeks. She subsequently remained free of complications
for another month, but then she complained of acute
abdominal pain and succumbed before she could be
taken to the hospital for medical attention suspected to
have had an unrelated sudden cardiac death. A post mor-
tem examination could not be performed.
Weakness and fatigue are accepted as normal accompani-
ments of aging. Usually, older individuals are not investi-
gated with much enthusiasm but a treatable cause is
discernible on several occasions. Here, anemia with CHF
was evident at presentation. Chronic disease, iron defi-
ciency, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, gastrointestinal
bleeding and myelodysplastic syndrome are commonly
identified.[1] Aplastic anemia, remains rare in older per-
sons. Older patients are usually ineligible for allogeneic
bone marrow transplantation, owing to absence of a
donor, advanced age and frail phenotype. Immunosup-
pression with cyclosporin and antithymocyte globulin
(ATG) is often contemplated but infrequently tried in
older individuals.[2,3] It is known that 50% younger
patients respond within 3 months of immunosuppres-
sion, and about 75% by 6 months, and become transfu-
sion independent, but some may have a persistently
hypoproliferative marrow. In the current case, bone mar-
row suppression followed a transient cryptogenic hepati-
tis, likely of a viral etiology. Aplastic anemia has been
reported between 3–6 months following cryptogenic hep-
atitis in younger patients.[4,5] A more protracted course
might be seen in older patients following immunosup-
pression. Our patient is unique in her uncommon presen-
tation, complex management issues and a favorable
outcome after a long and persevering therapeutic inter-
vention and finally her sudden death.

Consent could not be taken from the patient before pub-
