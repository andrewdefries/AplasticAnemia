Transcription factor, Jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP2), binds directly to histones and DNAs and then inhibits the p300-mediated
acetylation both of core histones and of reconstituted nucleosomes that contain JDP2 recognition DNA sequences. JDP2 plays
a key role as a repressor of adipocyte diﬀerentiation by regulation of the expression of the gene C/EBPδ via inhibition of
histone acetylation. Moreover, JDP2-deﬁcient mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (JDP2−/−
MEFs) are resistant to replicative senescence.
JDP2 inhibits the recruitment of polycomb repressive complexes (PRC1 and PRC2) to the promoter of the gene encoding
p16Ink4a, resulting from the inhibition of methylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27). Therefore, it seems that chromatin-
remodeling factors, including the PRC complex controlled by JDP2, may be important players in the senescence program. The
novel mechanisms that underline the action of JDP2 in inducing cellular senescence and suppressing adipocyte diﬀerentiation are
reviewed.
1. Introduction
The structure of chromatin, which inﬂuences numerous
DNA-associated phenomena, such as transcription, repli-
cation, recombination, and repair, is controlled by a com-
plex combination of histone modiﬁcations, ATP-dependent
chromatin-remodeling enzymes, and nucleosome-assembly
factors [1, 2]. The modiﬁcation of histones such as
acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination,
sumoylation, and ADP-ribosylation can regulate the gene
expression [1–4]. The chromatin consists of structural units
known as nucleosomes. Each nucleosome consists of two
histone H2A-H2B dimers, a histone (H3-H4)2 tetramer, and
DNA that is wrapped around the resultant histone octamers.
2 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology
During chromatin assembly, a histone (H3-H4)2 tetramer
is formed before the two heterodimers of histones H2A
and H2B are incorporated to form a nucleosome [5, 6].
The regulation of transcription is associated with alterations
in chromatin structure that include histone modiﬁcations
and changes in nucleosome structure [7–10]. Compaction
of the chromatin and organization of nuclesomes represent
a barrier that has to be overcome prior to the activation
of transcription. The N-terminal histone tails that protrude
from nucleosomes do not play a signiﬁcant role in nuclesome
formation but, rather, they appear to act as docking sites for
other proteins and protein complexes to regulate chromatin
compaction [9].
The structure of chromatin changes to allow greater
accessibility by transcription factors when a gene is to be acti-
vated [10]. It has been suggested that the change to a more
accessible state not only involves the modiﬁcation of histones
and alterations in nucleosomal arrays but also results from
changes in nucleosome integrity that are due to displacement
of histones [11]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that
histone chaperones play a critical role in these processes [12–
15]. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that histone chaperones
might be important for the compaction of chromatin, and it
is now important to determine whether certain corepressors
of transcription might inﬂuence the deposition and assembly
of nucleosomes through the regulation of histone-chaperone
activity. The transcription factor Jun dimerization protein 2
(JDP2) is a member of AP-1 family that binds to both AP-
1 site and cAMP responsive element (CRE) site in various
cis-elements of the target genes. It is generally accepted that
the transcription factors have DNA-binding activities and
then control their transcriptional activities by DNA binding.
However, we found that JDP2 has not only DNA-binding
activity but also histone-binding activity. Moreover, JDP2
bound the nucleosome in both DNA sequence-dependent
or -independent manner. JDP2 also has the nucleosome
assembly activities and the activities of inhibition of histone
acetyltransferase and histone methyltransferase. Here, we
describe the role of JDP2 on the adipocyte diﬀerentiation
and replicative senescence in mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts
through histone modiﬁcation.
2. JDP2 Regulates the AP-1-Mediated
Activation of Transcription
JDP2 has been identiﬁed as a binding partner of c-
Jun in yeast two-hybrid screening experiments, based on
the recruitment of the SOS system [16]. JDP2 forms
heterodimers with c-Jun and represses the AP-1-mediated
activation of transcription [16]. Similarly, JDP2 was isolated
by yeast two-hybrid screening with activation transcription
factor-2 (ATF-2) as the “bait” [17]. JDP2 was also shown
to associate with both the CCAT/enhancer-binding protein
gamma (C/EBPγ) [18] and the progesterone receptor [19].
JDP2 is expressed in many cell lines and represses the
transcriptional activity of AP-1 [20]. Moreover, JDP2 is
rapidly phosphorylated at threonine residue 148 when
cells are exposed to UV irradiation, oxidative stress, or
inhibitor-induced depressed levels of translation by c-
Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) [21]. Although a novel
JNK-docking domain is necessary for the activated kinase
(MAPK) p38-mediated phosphorylation of JDP2 at thre-
onine residue 148, this domain is not suﬃcient for this
process [22]. JDP2 binds to both cAMP-responsive element
(CRE) and TPA-responsive elements (TREs) on DNA as a
homodimer and as a heterodimer with ATF-2 and members
of the Jun family, respectively [16, 17]. JDP2 encoded an
18 kDa protein that is able to homodimerize as well as to
form heterodimers with other AP-1 members, such as c-
Jun, JunB, JunD, and ATF-2, and members of the C/EBP
family, C/EBPγ and C/EBP homologous protein 10 (CHOP
10) [16, 17] as well as Interferon regulatory factor- (IRF-
) binding protein 1 [23]. Dimerization occurs through a
conserved leucine zipper domain found all members of
the AP-1 family. A basic domain located adjacent to the
leucine zipper dimerization motif is responsible for the direct
association with TRE and CRE [16, 17]. In vitro study
using the puriﬁed JDP2 protein showed that JDP2 forms
the homotrimer but not the homodimer in our biochemical
condition (unpublished data). JDP2 inhibits UV-induced
apoptosis by suppressing the transcription of the p53 gene
[24]. Given the roles of AP-1 in cellular transformation
and the reported repression of Jun- and ATF-2-mediated
transcription by JDP2, we have demonstrated that JDP2
inhibits the oncogenic transformation of chicken embryonic
ﬁbroblasts [25]. JDP2 also modulates the expression of
cyclin D1 and p21, which have opposing eﬀects on cell-cycle
progression. JDP2 interferes with the progression of the cell
cycle by reducing the levels of cyclin D1 and at the same
time increases the expression of p21 [26, 27]. The forced
expression of JDP2 promotes the myogenic diﬀerentiation
of C2C12 cells, which is accompanied by the formation of
C2 myotubes and the strong expression of major myogenic
markers. Moreover, the ectopic expression of JDP2 in rhab-
domyosarcoma cells induces incomplete myogenesis and the
incomplete formation of myotubes [27]. These cells become
committed to diﬀerentiation via the p38-MAPK pathway
[21, 22]. A similar enhancement of cell diﬀerentiation was
reported during the induction of osteoclast formation by the
receptor activator of the nuclear factor kB (NFkB) ligand
(RANKL) [28]. Unlike other members of the AP-1 family,
the levels of JDP2 remain constant in response to a large
variety of stimuli, such as UV, irradiation, and retinoic acid
(RA), which aﬀect the levels of other factors involved in cell-
cycle control. The induction of JDP2 expression was only
observed during the diﬀerentiation of F9 cells to muscle cells
and osteoclasts. Therefore, JDP2 may provide a threshold for
exit from the cell cycle and a commitment to diﬀerentiation
(Figure 1). Further studies of the regulation of the cell cycle
and the diﬀerentiation of cells induced by JDP2 should be
very instructive. It is also interesting that JDP2 is one of the
candidate oncoproteins that collaborate in the oncogenesis
associated with the loss of p27 as the result of insertional
mutations [29]. Recent study of tumor cells demonstrated
that JDP2 was a tumor suppressor [30]. We have also found
that JDP2 is a repressor of the activation of transcription via
AP-1 and a negative regulator of the retinoic acid- (RA-)

adipocyte diﬀerentiation [31–33].
3. JDP2 Inhibits Histone Acetyltransferase
(HAT) Activity
We have reported previously that JDP2 represses the trans-
activation mediated by p300 [32]. Both p300 and ATF-
2 have HAT activity [34, 35]. It was recently shown that
p300 acetylates ATF-2 protein in vitro at lysine residues
357 and 374 and that ATF-2 is essential for the acetylation
of histones H4 and H2B in vivo [36, 37]. We found that
acetylation by p300 is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner
by JDP2, when added exogenously. We also found that
JDP2 was not acetylated by p300 under our experimental
conditions. The inhibitory eﬀect of JDP2 was detected on
histone acetylation induced by p300, CREB-binding protein
(CBP), p300/CBP-associated protein (PCAF), and general
control nonrepressive 5 (GCN5). The overexpression of JDP2
apparently represses the RA-induced acetylation of lysines
8 and 16 of histone H4 and some amino terminal lysine
residues of histone H3.
4. JDP2 Has Intrinsic Nucleosome-Assembly
Activity In Vitro
The template activation factor-1β protein (TAF-Iβ protein),
which is a component of the inhibition of histone acetylase
complex (INHAT complex) identiﬁed by Seo et al. [38, 39],
is a histone chaperone that binds directly to core histones
and facilitates the assembly of nucleosomes in vitro. JDP2
interacted directly with all the core histones tested and
inhibited the p300-mediated acetylation of those histones. To
our surprise, JDP2 also introduced supercoils into circular
DNA in the presence of core histones, to levels similar to
those observed for yeast CCG1-interacting factor 1 protein
(yCia1p) and CCG1-interactiing factor (CIA1). Therefore,
JDP2 appears to have signiﬁcant histone chaperone activity
in vitro [32]. We have also shown that the HAT-inhibitory
activity of JDP2 is involved, to some extent, in the repression
of transcription by JDP2, whereas the maximal capacity
4 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology
of JDP2 to suppress the RA-mediated activation of the c-
Jun promoter [32, Figure 1] and to suppress the adipocyte
diﬀerentiation [33] requires the recruitment of histone
deacetylases (HDACs).
5. JDP2 Suppresses Adipocyte Differentiation
JDP2 has been shown to play a role in the cellular diﬀerenti-
ation of skeletal muscle, osteoclasts, adipocytes [27, 33], and
F9 cells [31]. It has been reported that JDP2 has an activity of
tumor suppressor using prostate cancer cells [30]. Recently,
we also found that JDP2-deﬁcient mouse ﬁbroblasts are resis-
tant to replicative senescence [40]. Finally general inhibition
of the AP-1 complex by expression of JDP2 speciﬁcally in the
heart correlates with the induction of atrial dilatation [41].
In mammals, the strict control of adipocyte development, the
mass of adipose tissue, the insulin sensitivity of adipocycles,
and the appropriate metabolism of glucose and lipids are
critical to the maintenance of energy homeostasis [42, 43].
Adipogenesis, namely, the process whereby hormonal stimuli
induce the diﬀerentiation of ﬁbroblasts or mesenchymal
cells to adipocytes, requires the organized and controlled
expression of a cascade of transcription factors and the mod-
iﬁcation of the chromatin within preadipocytes [44–47]. The
factors involved in adipocyte diﬀerentiation include a nuclear
receptor known as peroxisome proliferation-activated recep-
tor gamma (PPARγ) and a group of C/EBPs [48, 49]. The
rapid and transient induction of the expression of C/EBPβ
and C/EBPδ is one of the earliest events in adipogenesis
[46]. These transcription factors bind to speciﬁc sequences
in the promoters of the C/EBPα gene and the PPARγ gene,
inducing their expression, which, in turn, activates the full
adipogenic program of gene expression [50–53]. Expression
of PPARγ is also induced via a sterol-regulating element-
binding protein-1c- (SREBP-1c-) dependent pathway [54].
Once both PPARγ2 and C/EBPα are activated, “cross-talk”
between PPARγ and C/EBPα maintains the expression of
each protein during adipocyte diﬀerentiation, even in the
absence of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ [55]. We generated JDP2
“knock-out” (KO) mice in order to study the activities of
JDP2 in vivo, and we found that JDP2 plays a role as a
repressor of adipocyte diﬀerentiation. We also found that
JDP2 targeted an adipogenesis-related gene, C/EBPδ, and
inhibited its expression via regulation of histone acetylation.
The C/EBPδ and C/EBPα mRNAs were overexpressed
in Jdp2−/−
MEFs during the initial stages of adipocyte
diﬀerentiation, whereas C/EBPβ and PPARγ mRNAs were
less aﬀected by the absence of JDP2 [56]. C/EBPα is known
to be the downstream target of C/EBPδ and C/EBPβ [57];
therefore, it can be speculated that the augmentation of
expression of the C/EBP gene might have been due to
indirect eﬀects, which were probably caused by the enhanced
expression of the C/EBPδ gene [33]. In fact, the recruitment
of JDP2 to the C/EBPδ and C/EBPβ genes was detected, but
there was no obvious recruitment to the C/EBPα gene. Thus,
the target of JDP2 is possibly the C/EBPδ and C/EBPβ genes.
JDP2 was able to bind to the C/EBPδ promoter to repress
the transcription of the C/EBPδ gene. Our JDP2-deﬁcient
mice did not have abundant adipose cells, in other words,
they did not have a thick layer of fat tissue, perhaps because
the mass of adipose tissue might be determined by more
complex factors, such as cytokines and hormones, via as
yet unknown mechanisms, and by energy status. We found
that the adipose tissue of scapulae from young Jdp2−/−
mice
consisted mostly of white adipocytes, whereas the majority
of cells were brown adipocytes in WT mice. This observation
suggested that JDP2 might play a role in adipogenesis in vivo.
Recently, it has been reported that the activation of Wnt
signalling inhibited the development of brown adipocytes
by mediating the peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor
gamma-1 coactivator-1-1α- (PGC1-1α)-) uncoupling pro-
tein1 (UCP1) cascade [48]. In addition to C/EBPs as shown
in the present studies, JDP2 might be a target of such
signal networks. Other report suggested that the absence
of Rb switched the diﬀerentiation of mouse embryonic
ﬁbroblast (MEF) cells from white to brown adipocytes [58],
suggesting that the diﬀerentiation of WT MEFs to adipocytes
is a good model for white-adipocyte diﬀerentiation but
not for brown-adipocyte diﬀerentiation. We also observed
that PGC-1α marker of brown adipocyte was not induced
after induction of adipocyte diﬀerentiation in Jdp2−/−
MEFs
and WT MEFs (unpublished). Then, we analyzed the
levels of mRNA of PGC-1α in Adeno-JDP2-infected 3T3-
L1 cells. 3T3-L1 cells are also known to be a model for
white-adipocyte diﬀerentiation, however, we could detect
small amount of PGC-1α RNA by real-time RT-PCR as
the others reported elsewhere [59] probably because quite
minor population of 3T3-L1 cells can diﬀerentiate to brown
adipocyte. The expression of PGC-1α was increased after
adipocyte diﬀerentiation, and the levels of expression were
not remarkably diﬀerent between Adeno-JDP2- and Adeno-
lacZ -infected 3T3-L1 cells. So, we speculate that JDP2 might
inhibit the diﬀerentiation of white adipocytes exclusively, but
not brown adipocytes. In consequence, brown adipocytes are
preferentially developed in WT mice scapulae, whereas white
adipocytes appear in Jdp2−/−
mice. However, further studies
are required to clarify the role of JDP2 in the molecular
mechanism that directs ﬁbroblast and mesenchymal cells to
diﬀerentiate into white or brown adipocytes.
6. JDP2 Controls Replicative Senescence
We analyzed the aging-dependent proliferation of MEFs
from Jdp2−/−
ice in the presence of environmental (20%)
or low (3%) oxygen [40]. The Jdp2−/−
MEFs continued to
divide, even after six weeks, whereas the wild-type MEFs
almost stopped proliferating and entered senescence under
environmental oxygen. Conversely, neither the wild-type
MEFs nor the Jdp2−/−
MEFs succumbed to replicative senes-
cence at lower oxidative stress. These results demonstrate that
MEFs lacking JDP2 can escape from the irreversible growth
arrest caused by environmental oxygen. The expressions of
p16Ink4a and alternative reading frame (Arf) were repressed
in aged Jdp2−/−
MEFs (40 days) compared with their levels
in wild-type MEFs. In 3% oxygen, at the equivalent time (40
days), wild-type MEFs expressed lower levels of p16Ink4a and

Figure 3: Proposed model of the epigenetic regulation of the expression of the genes for p16Ink4a and Arf by JDP2. The exposure of young
MEF primary cells to aging stress leads to the accumulation of JDP2. JDP2 binds to histones and inhibits the methylation of H3K27 at the
p16Ink4a/Arf locus. As a result, PRC-1 and PRC-2 fail to form stable repressive complexes and are released from the locus. The consequent
expression of p16Ink4a and Arf in the aged cells leads to growth arrest and senescence stage.
Arf compared with those in 20% oxygen, whereas Jdp2−/−
MEFs maintained low-level expression of p16Ink4a and Arf
(Figure 3). These observations indicate that the aging-
associated expression of p16Ink4a and Arf is dependent on
oxygen stress and that JDP2 controls the expression of both
p16Ink4a and Arf. We found no dramatic downregulation
of the upstream repressors of p16Ink4a/Arf, B lymphocyte
molony murine leukemia virus insertion region 1 homology
(Bmi1), and enhancer of zesta homolog 2 (Ezh2), in the
absence of JDP2, suggesting that JDP2 does not regulate their
expression. Interestingly, JDP2 expression in wild-type MEFs
increased in the presence of 20% oxygen, but not in the pres-
ence of 3% oxygen, suggesting that its expression depends on
oxygenic stress and that accumulated JDP2 may play a role
in the transcriptional activation of p16Ink4a/Arf (Figure 2).
Studies based on ChIP have demonstrated that the methyla-
tion of H3K27 at the p16Ink4a/Arf locus was higher in Jdp2−/−
MEFs than in wild-type MEFs and that the binding of poly-
comb repressor complex 1(PRC1) and polycomb repressor
complex 2 (PRC2) to the p16Ink4a and Arf promoters was
more eﬃcient in Jdp2−/−
MEFs than in wild-type MEFs.
These observations suggest that, in the absence of JDP2,
H3K27 is methylated by PRC2, and the p16Ink4a/Arf locus is
silenced by PRC1, whereas the increased expression of JDP2
helps to release PRC1 and PRC2 from the p16Ink4a/Arf locus,
thereby reducing H3K27 methylation. Our data demonstrate
that JDP2 is an important factor regulating cellular senes-
cence. The loss of JDP2 allows MEFs to escape senescence,
6 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology
and conversely, the overexpression of JDP2 induces cell-cycle
arrest. The absence of JDP2 reduces the expression of both
p16Ink4a and Arf, which inhibit cell-cycle progression.
6.1. p16Ink4a and the Rb Pathway. Genes that are essential
for cell-cycle progression are transcribed at the beginning
of G1 phase by transcription factors of the E2F family.
E2F is controlled by Rb family of proteins, pRb, p107, and
p130 [60, 61]. Early in G1, unphosphorylated Rb proteins
bind to the E2F family of proteins and inactivate their
function [62, 63]. During G1, the Rb proteins are inactivated
by phosphorylation by Cdk4/6-cyclinD complexes, thereby
allowing the transcription of E2F-dependent gene, including
cyclin E. Upregulated cyclin E forms a complex with cdk2,
that mediates the hyperphosphorylation of the Rb proteins,
an essential requirement for the G1/S transition. p16Ink4a is
an allosteric inhibitor of cdk4/6. Binding to p16Ink4achanges
the conformation of cdk4/6, which prevents its interaction
with cyclin D [64, 65]. Therefore, p16Ink4a acts as an inhibitor
of the cell cycle at G1 by modulating the Rb pathway. p16Ink4a
is often lost in a variety of human malignancies, including
glioblastoma, melanoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma
[66]. In contrast, the upregulation of p16Ink4a induces the
cell-cycle arrest and senescence [65, 66].
6.2. Arf and the p53 Pathway. p53 is known to mediate
cell-cycle arrest, in G1 and G2, and apoptosis. A num-
ber of downstream targets of p53 are involved in these
processes, including p21Cip/wa f 1 in G1 arrest [67], 14-3-3
sigma and growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gene
45 (GADD45) in G2 arrest [68, 69], and p21, Bax, PI-
3 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), Fas/Apo1,
and Killer/DR5 in apoptosis [70–74]. p53 is regulated at
the levels of protein stability and activity, and to some
extent at transcription and translation [75, 76]. In unstressed
cells, p53 protein levels are very low because its degradation
is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of murine
double minute 2 (MDM2), which targets p53 for ubiquitin-
dependent proteolysis [77]. MDM2 is a transcriptional
target of p53, so p53 directly activates the expression of
its own negative regulator, producing a potent negative
feedback regulatory loop [78]. There are several stress-
responsive kinases, which, by phosphorylating p53, inhibit
its degradation by MDM2 and increase its transcriptional
activity [79–81]. DNA damage rapidly activates the ataxia
telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia elangiectasia-
related (ATR) proteins, which phosphorylate the checkpoint
kinases 1 and 2 (Chk1 and Chk2), which in turn propagate
the signal to downstream eﬀectors such as p53 [82, 83].
Both Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylate p53 at Ser 20, which
prevents the eﬃcient recruitment of MDM2. Thus, p53 is
stabilized and its expression level is increased in response to
stress signaling. Arf is predominantly localized in the nucleoli
and is stabilized by binding to nucleophosmin. In response
to stress signaling, Arf is released from nucleophosmin and
translocates to the nucleoplasm, where it interacts with
MDM2, inhibits its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and blocks
the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the MDM2-p53 complex.
Therefore, the consequences of the activation of Arf are the
stabilization and activation of p53 [84, 85].
6.3. Senescence and Aging in Human and Mouse. Cellular
senescence appears to be related to organismal aging. Cellular
senescence involves processes that include telomere shorten-
ing, the accumulation of DNA damage, and the activation
of the p16Ink4a/Arf locus. The contributions of these factors
to senescence seem to diﬀer in humans and mice. Cultured
mouse ﬁbroblasts undergo senescence even when they have
long telomeres and high telomerase activity. Senescence is
abrogated by the loss of the p16Ink4a/Arf locus [86]. In
human cell cultures, the ectopic expression of telomerase is
suﬃcient to overcome senescence by maintaining the length
of the telomeres [87]. In mice, the maintenance of telomere
length is important because telomerase deﬁciency shortens
their lifespan and leads to premature aging [88–92]. The age-
dependent accumulation of INK4A has been observed in the
human kidney and skin [91], as well as in the majority of
mouse tissues [92]. In oncogene-induced senescence, there
is in vivo evidence that Arf is the important factor in the
activation of p53 tumor suppression [91]. However, another
study has shown that components of the DNA-damage-
signaling cascade, including ATM and Chk2, are critical
for the activation of p53 in response to oncogenic signals
[93]. These diﬀerences between humans and mice could
be attributable to species speciﬁcity and/or experimental
conditions. Cellular senescence appears to be related to
organismal aging because the same processes appear to be
involved. Genetic variants of the p16Ink4a/Arf locus are linked
to age-associated disorders, such as general frailty, heart
failure, and type 2 diabetes [94–99]. Mutations in telomerase
or in proteins that aﬀect telomerase activity are linked to
premature human aging syndromes, including congenital
dyskeratosis and aplastic anemia [100]. There are increases
in DNA mutations, DNA oxidation, and chromosome loss
during organismal aging. It seems reasonable to assume that
all three factors, the activation of the p16Ink4a/Arf locus,
telomere shortening, and the accumulation of DNA damage,
have cooperative eﬀects on aging in physiological situations.
Understanding the mechanisms of cellular senescence is
currently of wide interest, and it is important that we identify
new components of this process, such as JDP2.
7. Interaction of Transcription Factors with
Histones and Nucleosomes
Similar to JDP2, other transcription factors or chromatin
regulators are reported to have the binding aﬃnities to his-
tones and/or nucleosome. Transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA)
is a 40-kDa protein, with nine zinc ﬁnger domains, that binds
speciﬁcally to the internal promoter of the gene for 5S RNA
and to the N-terminal tail domains of histones H3 and H4,
but not those of H2A and/or H2B, and directly modulates
the ability of TFIIIA to bind nucleosomal DNA [101, 102].
A new class of HAT-regulatory proteins has been iden-
tiﬁed. These proteins block HAT activity via binding to
and masking of the histone themselves. This class includes
Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology 7
the subunits of INHAT complex; TAF-1α, TAF-1β, and
pp32 as well as ataxin 3; silencing mediator or retinoid
receptor corepressor (SMART)/nuclear hormone receptor
corepressor (NcoR); proline-glutamic acid- and leucine-rich
protein 1 (PELP1) [103–107]. Thanatos-associated protein
7 (THAP7) is known to associate with TAF-1β and to
repress transcription by inhibition histone acetylation [108,
109]. A novel INHAT repressor (NIR) binds directly to
nucleosomes and core histones and prevents acetylation by
histone acetyltransferases, thus acting as a bona ﬁde INHAT
[110]. PU.1, a member of the Ets family of oncoproteins,
inhibits CBP-mediated acetylation of globin transcription
factor-1 (GATA-1) and erythroid Kr¨uppel-like factor (EKLF),
as well as of histones, and disrupts acetylation-dependent
transcriptional events [111]. Moreover, PU.1 recruits the
retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor protein, a histone methyl-
transferase (HMT) Suv39H, and heterochromatin protein 1α
(Hp1α) [112]. Similarly, proliferating cell nuclear antigen
binds to p300 to inhibit its HAT activity in vitro and to
block HAT-dependent transcription in vivo [113]. TAF-1β
and pp32 have also been shown to interact with estrogen
receptor (ERα), to inhibit the ERα-mediated activation of
transcription, and to inhibit the activation of ERα acetylation
by p300 [106, 107]. Moreover, TAF-1β also interacts with
the Sp-1 transcription factor and with KLF5, negatively
regulating the binding to DNA and activation of transcrip-
tion by these factors [114, 115]. Transcription factor NF-
kB p50 can accommodate distorted, bent DNA within the
nucleosome [116], while DNA-binding domain (DBD) of
c-Myb binds to the N-terminal tails of H3 and H3.3, and
binding of c-Myb facilitates acetylation of histone tails [117].
Moreover, a kinetochore-null protein (KNL-2) with a c-Myb-
like DNA-binding domain is speciﬁcally required for loading
of centromere-speciﬁc variants of histone H3 (centromere
protein A; CENP-A) in both nematodes and mammalian
cells [118]. The recruitment of repressive macroH2A nucle-
osomes requires direct interactions between ATF-2 bound
to a nearby AP-1 site and macroH2A, and recruitment is
regulated by DNA-induced protein allostery [119]. Thus,
the abovementioned sequence-speciﬁc DNA-binding factors
might regulate transcription either via histone cores or tails,
as well as via the structure of nucleosomes in conjunction
with other proteins that bind to the chromatin. Indeed
JDP2 is the ﬁrst case to have both nuclesome assembly
activity and DNA-binding activity [32] and inhibits the
histone acetylation by p300/CBP [32, 33] as well as histone
methylation [40] as described below.
8. Mechanism of JDP2-Mediated Regulation of
C/EBPδ and p16Ink4a/p19
Diﬀerentiation and senescence are associated with dynamic
changes in gene expression, which are regulated by chro-
matin remodeling. Here, we have shown that the expres-
sion of JDP2 regulated the diﬀerentiation competent genes
and the senescence competent genes such as C/EBPδ and
p16Ink4a and Arf in response to the induced hormone and
accumulating oxidative stresses. In the case of suppression of
adipocyte diﬀerentiation by JDP2, how might JDP2 inhibit
transcription of the C/EBPδ gene? It seems possible that, in
response to signals that lead to diﬀerentiation, the C/EBPδ
promoter might recruit transcription factors, including the
coactivator p300, that mediate the acetylation of histones
associated with the C/EBPδ gene to stimulate transcription
of this gene. In the presence of JDP2, the acetylation of
histone is inhibited and the expression of the C/EBPδ
gene is suppressed during adipocyte diﬀerentiation, even in
the presence of diﬀerentiation-inducing signals. Decreased
expression of C/EBPδ results in less eﬀective diﬀerentiation
to adipocytes, a conclusion that is consistent with a previous
report that deletion of the C/EBPδ gene results in the
impairment of adipocyte diﬀerentiation [59]. By contrast,
HDAC3 was not recruited by JDP2 to the promoter region of
the C/EBPβ gene, although the recruitment of HDAC3 to the
C/EBPβ gene was slightly enhanced during diﬀerentiation. In
addition, the acetylation of histone H3 on the C/EBPβ gene
was less aﬀected by diﬀerentiation-inducing stimuli. These
observations suggest that histone acetylation might not play
an important role in the transcriptional regulation of the
C/EBPβ, gene and the HDAC3 might not be involved in
such regulation. This hypothesis explains why the presence
of JDP2 on the promoter had no eﬀect on transcription.
In conclusion, we propose that JDP2 acts as a negative
molecular-switch in some, but not all, types of diﬀerentiation
via the regulation of the expression of speciﬁc genes in
concert with histone deacetylase HDAC3, as shown in the
present study of adipocyte diﬀerentiation.
In the case of induction of cellular senescence by JDP2,
we propose a model; the accumulation of oxidative stress
and/or other environmental stimuli during aging upregulate
JDP2 expression in primary untransformed cells. Increased
JDP2 helps to remove PRC1 and PRC2, which are responsible
for the methylation of histone H3, from the p16Ink4a/Arf
locus, leading to increased p16Ink4a and Arf expression and
entry into the senescence (Figure 4). There is some evidence
that JDP2 acts as a tumor suppressor; JDP2 inhibits the Ras-
dependent transformation of NIH3T3 cells [29], and JDP2
gene disruptions are often found in the lymphomas induced
by insertional mutagenesis caused by the Moloney murine
leukemia virus in MYC/Runx2 transgenic mice [27]. Here,
we suggest that JDP2 not only inhibits the transformation of
cells but also plays a role in the induction of cell senescence.
Both functions of JDP2 might be important for its role in
inhibiting tumor formation. Our ﬁndings also provide new
insights into the molecular mechanisms, by which senes-
cence is induced in the context of the epigenetic regulation of
the p16Ink4a/Arf locus. Recently, we reported that JDP2 regu-
lates the expressions of cell-cycle regulators such as cyclin A2,
cyclin E2, and p16Ink4a and also aﬀects the expression of p53
and p21 protein [120]. Thus, it is evident that JDP2 control
the expression of cell-cycle regulators to induce the cell-cycle
arrest via p53-p21 pathway and RB-p16 pathway.
9. Concluding Remarks
We characterized a sequence-speciﬁc DNA-binding pro-
tein as a nucleosome-assembly factor. Our ﬁnding should

Figure 4: Model for the epigenetic regulation by JDP2. During the exposure of cells with oxydative stress, retinoic acid (RA), RANKL, TPA,
and adipocyte inducing hormones, the histone H3, H4K8, and H4K16 as well as H3K27 were masked by JDP2 proteins and prevent the
attack of histone modiﬁcation enzymes like HAT (p300/CBP, pCAF, GCN5, MOF, etc.) and HMT (Ezh2 etc) in the cellular senescence and
cell diﬀerentiation. This is a novel mechanism of JDP2 to inhibit the histone modiﬁcation. The gene locus is either the p16Ink4a/Arf locus or
C/EBPδ locus.
facilitate eﬀorts to understand some aspects of nuclesome
assembly and the remodeling of chromatin. Histone H3
seems to be recruited to target sites in a DNA synthesis-
dependent manner via the interaction of chromatin assem-
bly factor 1 (CAF-1) with proliferation cell nuclear anti-
gen (PCNA); by contrast, a histone chaperone HIRA
was reported to incorporate H3.3 in a DNA synthesis-
independent manner [15]. The observation that histone
H3.3 is found in several other subcomplex suggests that
H3.3 might be recruited to diﬀerent sites by diﬀerent
pathways. Identiﬁcation of a gene-speciﬁc DNA-binding
protein, namely JDP2, as a nucleosome-assembly factor
suggests that H3.3 could be directly deposited at speciﬁc
locations by site-speciﬁc DNA-binding proteins that also
have histone-chaperone activity. It will be of interest to
examine the binding preference of JDP2 for histone H3 as
compared with H3.3.
Since JDP2 binds to core histone or nuclesome partially
in DNA sequence-speciﬁc manner or histone subset-speciﬁc
manner, the histone acetyltransferase or histone methytrans-
ferase may not access to the nucleosome in vitro (Figure 4).
However, we are not sure the case of in vivo. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP assay) demonstrated that
JDP2 inhibited at least the acetylation of histone H4K8
and H4K16 although we cannot determine other precise
residues of histone H3 acetylation (31). Moreover, JDP2
associated with histone H3K27 and blocked the methylation
of histones (40). Thus, we assume that the interaction
of JDP2 with nucleosome is DNA sequence or histone
modiﬁcation speciﬁc, and thus, only certain restricted set of
histone might be associated with JDP2 in vivo. Addressing
these precise functions in the context of epigenesis helps us to
understand how senescence and diﬀerentiation, in a broader
context, are regulated.
10. Future Prospects
Understanding how JDP2 promotes aging or cell diﬀerenti-
ation, whether by inducing cellular senescence or decreasing
the frequency of cell-cycle entry, is an important issue. The
data demonstrating the increase in expression of p16Ink4a
or C/EBPδ with aging (or oxygen stress) or hormone
induction can be reconciled with two diﬀerent models like
“commitment model” and “threshold model.” With aging
or hormone induction, stochastic activation of p16Ink4a or
C/EBPδ expression could occur on a cell-by-cell basis in self-
renewing compartments to induce commitment (commit-

ment model), or expression could increase simultaneously
with the majority of cells of a self-renewing compartment
(threshold model) (Figure 5). In the latter case, self-renewal
would be impaired by p16Ink4a or C/EBPδ expression by
decreased frequency of cell-cycle entry in the absence of
senescence or cell diﬀerentiation.
Addressing this question has important implications for
future “antiaging” therapies or “antidiﬀerentiation” ther-
apies. The model in which cell-cycle entry is decreased
(threshold model) suggests that the age-induced defects in
proliferation or the hormone-induced defects in prolifera-
tion could be improved merely by reducing p16Ink4a levels
or C/EBPδ levels or otherwise increasing cdk4/6 activity
in these cells. The commitment model, however, suggests
that the defects in self-renewal could only be remedied
through more drastic self-renewing cells from an exogenous
source. The understanding of the in vivo regulation of
the Ink4a/Arf/Ink4b locus with aging (oxidative stress) or
C/EBPδ locus with diﬀerentiation is needed further.
