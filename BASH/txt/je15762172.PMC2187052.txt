Minor histocompatibility antigens are defined as antigens that elicit tissue-graft
rejection in the absence of differences at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
(1). Analysis of T cell responses to minor antigens is potentially informative for two
reasons: (a) as one model system in which to analyze the basic mechanisms of T cell
responses, and (b) as an in vitro model of immune responses that occur in clinical
transplant recipients of tissue from an MHC-matched allogeneic donor. T cell
recognition of minor histocompatibility antigens normally requires identity of a major
histocompatibility antigen between responder and stimulator and an in vivo priming
of the responding individual (2, 3). The best characterized human minor antigen is
designated H-Y, the male-associated antigens. Goulmy and colleagues (4) first de-
scribed human cell-mediated cytoxicity specific for H-Y in the blood of a female
patient with aplastic anemia who had rejected a bone marrow transplant from a male
HLA-identical sibling. Subsequent studies have shown that multiple transfusions are
sufficient to prime for cellular responses to the H-Y antigen. Several individuals have
been found to have HLA-A2-restricted H-Y-specific cytotoxic effectors, and at least
one donor was also found to have a subset of HLA-B7-restricted H-Y-specific cytotoxic
effectors (5). Minor histocompatibility antigens different from H-Y were first described
by Parkman et al. (6); specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were derived from
patients with aplastic anemia, who had rejected bone marrow transplants from HLA-
identical siblings. Elkins et al. (7) described a patient whose lymphocytes were primed
to recognize an HLA-B7-restricted minor antigen. Similar to the circumstances in H-
Y priming, this patient had received repeated transfusions from HLA-identical
siblings (some of whose cells expressed this minor antigen).
The present study reports and analyzes HLA-restricted cell-mediated lympholysis
(CML) against a human minor antigen(s) that can be readily generated in vitro from
the blood of a normal female. Since she is a multiparous female whose children are
virtually HLA identical to her but express the minor antigen, it is plausible that her
response reflects in vivo priming during pregnancy.
Materials and Methods
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained by batch leukapheresis, separated
by flotation on Ficoll-Hypaque, and cryopreserved as previously described (8). Plasma from six
or more male donors was pooled, frozen in aliquots at -20°C, and used as the normal human

CTL were generated as previously described (9). Briefly, 9 × 10s responding cells were
cultured for 10 d with 3 × 106 2,000-rad-irradiated stimulator cells in a 25-cm2 tissue culture
flask. To generate secondary effectors primary cultures were harvested after 10 d and either
cryopreserved or restimulated immediately. 3 X 10s primed cells (fresh or thawed after
cryopreservation) were restimulated with 9 X l0s 2,000-rad-irradiated stimulator cells in 8 ml
culture medium supplemented with 1.5 ml heat-inactivated human plasma, and harvested after
4d.
Cytotoxicity was determined in a standard 4-h 5XCr-release assay (8) using 1 x 104 phyto-
hemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated target cells and effector to target cell ratios of 40:1, 15:1, and
4:1. CML assays were performed in triplicate and percent specific lysis was calculated as [(mean
counts per minute, experimental - mean counts per minute, media)/(mean counts per minute,
detergent - mean counts per minute, media)] X 100.
Results and Discussion
Detection of a CML Target Antigen by a Unique Responder]Stimulator Combination. As
part of a systematic analysis of histocompatibility antigens that differ between 12
donors completely matched for the serologically defined HLA-A, -B, and -C antigens,
mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) were generated between many combinations of
these donors, restimulated in secondary MLC, and the lymphocytes tested for CTL
activity with target cells from the donor used as stimulator. CTL FC4/FR4, directed
against HLA-A1 and -BS, was used as control to show comparable lysability of the
different target cells (Table I). Strong eytotoxieity (>20% lysis) on PHA-stimulated
lymphoblasts was seen in only one combination: donor H9 anti-donor W7. Detection
of this antigen by CML seemed to require secondary restimulation, because little
cytotoxicity was seen after primary stimulation (data not shown). To maximize
reproducibility in subsequent studies of the specificity of this cytotoxic activity, large
batches of primed cells were frozen after primary stimulation, and were used as

Fig. 1 summarizes the results of four experiments testing H9/W7 effectors on panels
of target cells from unrelated donors. The pattern of lysis was clearly bimodal, which
indicates that these effectors were recognizing predominantly the presence or absence
of a single antigen or group of genetically associated antigens in the population of
donors. Target cells from 17 of 35 HLA-B7-positive donors were lysed, while only 1
of 40 B7-negative donors' cells was lysed. Thus, with a single exception, the antigen
was detected only on B7-positive cells. The single exception is donor W1, with the
serologieally defined phenotype of HLA-A23, -24, -Bw44, -. Family studies of the only
available family member failed to distinguish whether this reflects homozygosity for
Bw44 or the presence of a serologically undefined B locus antigen.
Family Studies Indicate Controlby Gene(s) Independent of HLA. The pattern of lysis
observed in the population was consistent with at least three possible specificities of
the CTL: (a) for a molecular variation in the B7 molecule that is not yet serologically
defined; (b) for the product of an allele of another HLA-linked gene in strong positive
linkage disequilibrium with the HLA-B7 allele; or (c) for a human 'minor' histocom-
patibility antigen recognized in conjunction with an HLA antigen highly associated
with B7. Studies of three generations of family B (Table II) prove that the antigen
recognized by H9/W7 is controlled by at least one gene distinct from B7. The donors
in the family whose cells express the cytotoxic target antigen are those that have
inherited the 'a' haplotype, which encodes HLA-B 7. However, one of the six members
(FB12) who has inherited this haplotype does not express the antigen recognized by
the CTL H9/W7; since the typing indicates clearly that FB12 inherited the B7
haplotype from his mother FB4, failure of his cells to express the CTL antigen must
indicate that the B7 gene per se is not sufficient for expression of the CTL antigen.
Furthermore, these data make hypothesis b unlikely; there has been no recombination
on the B7 haplotype between HLA-Aw24 and DR4, so the postulated HLA-B7-

associated allele would have to be of a gene outside this region, and therefore unlikely
to show such extraordinarily strong linkage disquilibrium with B7.
The results on the second family (W), although less conclusive, are most consistent
with minor antigen recognition (Table II). In this family, both parents are positive for
B7, but only the father expresses the antigen recognized by H9/W7. If the target
antigen were related only to expression of a particular structurally distinct subset of
the B7 molecule, then only the children who inherited the B7 from the father ought
to express the antigen recognized by H9/W7. Instead, all children, including one who
inherited B7 from the mother and not from the father (FW5), express the antigen. A
plausible interpretation of this data is that although the mother expressed an
appropriate B7, she lacked the relevant allele of the minor antigen; FW5 expresses
the full antigenic complex since he inherited the B7 gene from his mother and the
minor antigen from his father. There is an alternate explanation: that the CTL
antigen that is recognized on the father's cells is encoded by genes on both his HLA-
B7 and -B18 haplotypes; however, it is statistically improbable (P ~1/40) that his
2176 TEKOLF AND SHAW BRIEFDEFINITIVE REPORT
A30-B 18 haplotype should encode the antigen when most B7-negative haplotypes in
the population do not. Data from these two families suggest that there is another
gene, provisionally designated HM 1 for human minor 1, that controls the expression
of the complete antigen. This antigen is not identical to the H-Y antigen because it
is expressed on cells of female donors as well. The phenotype frequency for HM1,
calculated from the phenotype frequency among HLA-B7-positive donors (17/35)
(Fig. 1), is ~50%, which implies a gene frequency of ~30%, if the gene is expressed
codominantly.
Evidencefor PossibleIn Vivo Priming During Pregnancy. The combination H9/W7 is
unusual in its ability to recognize HM 1. As can be seen from Table I, four other
combinations of HMl-negative cells against HM 1-positive cells, e.g., B17/F2 or K2/
W7, do not detect HM1. Furthermore, other potential minor antigen differences are
not recognized strongly in any of the 14 other combinations of HLA-matched donors.
The lower level of lysis (<20%), seen in many combinations, is consistent with Ia-
specific kill on the PHA-stimulated targets (10). Is the detection of a minor histocom-
patibility antigen by the CTL response H9 anti-W7 really due to an unusual
responsiveness of H9 or perhaps due to a uniqueness of cells from donor W7? Two
additional data argue for the former. First, W7 did not stimulate cells from other
donors against minor histocompatibility antigens (Table I). Second, although H9/
W7 preferentially recognized only one antigen, the relative differences within the
group of HLA-B7-negative donors suggest further complexity (Fig. 1). Indeed, another
donor was identified, whose cells stimulated cells from H9 against at least two other
minor histocompatibility antigens (manuscript in preparation). Thus, H9 is unique in
the ability of her cells to recognize multiple minor histocompatibility antigens.
Studies of minor histocompatibility antigens in mice indicate that detection of these
antigens normally requires both an initial in vivo priming and H-2 identity between
responder and stimulator during priming. We therefore investigated whether an in
vivo priming of donor H9 could account for the donor's unusual reaction against
minor histocompatibility antigens. As H9 never received any blood transfusions or
organ transplants, pregnancy would have been the only known allogeneic exposure.
It has already been demonstrated, by detection of Y chromosome-containing lympho-
cytes in the blood of mothers with male fetuses, that an exchange of small amounts of
white cells can occur (11). Theoretically it is likely that these cells are removed from
the maternal circulation quite rapidly by humoral and cellular responses against
antigens controlled by the paternal HLA haplotype of the fetal cells. Studies of
available members of H9's family revealed the postulated conditions for an in vivo
priming against minor histoeompatibility antigens (Table I). Both children are HLA-
A, -B, -C, and -DR identical with their mother. One child (FH3) is SB different and
expresses the HM1 target antigen. The other child is SB identical with her mother
and does not express HM 1. These data not only prove that one of the children carries
the relevant antigen necessary for a priming during pregnancy but also show a virtual
HLA identity between mother and children, which may have provided optimal
conditions for priming against minor histocompatibility antigens during pregnancy.
No other unusual features of H9's pregnancies could be identified.
Although minor histocompatibility antigens are thought to play an important role
in transplantation biology, our knowledge about these antigens in humans is very
limited. Cells from donors like the one described in this study, i.e., in whom a priming
TEKOLF AND SHAW BRIEF DEFINITIVE REPORT 2177
against minor histocompatibility antigens has occurred, will facilitate identification
of "immunodominant" minor histocompatibility antigens and investigation of the
biological role of these antigens.
Summary
A normal female donor (Hg) is described, whose cells generate strong cytotoxicity
against a human minor histocompatibility antigen in vitro. These cytotoxic T
lymphocytes are generated after secondary restimulation with cells from an HLA-A,
-B, -(2, and -DR-matched donor and are HLA restricted (HLA-BT). No other donor
could be identified whose cells responded to this antigen. The two children of donor
H9 are virtually HLA identical to her and one of the children expresses the relevant
minor histocompatibility antigen. These data suggest that priming in vivo during
pregnancy has facilitated cytotoxic T cell response to human minor histocompatibility
antigens in vitro.
