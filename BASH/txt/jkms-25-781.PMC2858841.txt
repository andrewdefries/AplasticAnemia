INTRODUCTION
Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is one
of the most serious complications after solid organ transplan-
tation and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
The incidence has been reported to be about 1 percent of all
transplantations (1, 2). PTLDs, including polyclonal lympho-
proliferation of B lymphocytes, polymorphic PTLD and mo-
nomorphic B-cell lymphoma, are extremely heterogeneous.
The risk factors for PTLD include the Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) serostatus, primary EBV infection, type of organ trans-
plant, intensity of immunosuppression, presence of cytome-
galovirus disease, and age (3-6). EBV infection is thought to
play the most important role in the pathogenesis of PTLD
(7). During primary EBV infection, EBV infects, transforms
and immortalizes host B lymphocytes, and the individual
becomes a permanent carrier. EBV-infected B lymphocytes
commonly remain in the latent state, protected from viral
proteins by preventing death by apoptosis and from causing
proliferation. In immunocompetent hosts, the proliferation
of B lymphocytes is inhibited by cytotoxic T cells. Howev-
er, in organ transplant recipients, T-cell function is inhibit-
ed through the use of immunosuppressants. Therefore, EBV
induces uncontrolled B-cell expansion, resulting in PTLD.
In other words, deficiencies of EBV-specific T-cell-mediated
immunity may cause PTLD (7-12).
PTLD is successfully treated by reducing immunosuppres-
sion. Other treatment methods such as chemotherapy, radi-
ation therapy, antiviral therapy, anti-B-cell monoclonal anti-
body, and cytotoxic T cells are currently being investigated.
CASE REPORT
A 16-yr-old Korean girl who was previously healthy devel-
oped jaundice in March 2005. It progressed to acute fulmi-
nant hepatitis 1 month later. A diagnosis of Wilson disease
was made on the basis of increased copper in 24-hr urine and
a Kayser-Fleischer ring on cornea examination. In April 2005,
she received cadaveric liver transplantation. Before transfu-
sion, IgG antibody against viral capsid antigen (VCA) and
IgG antibody against Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA)
were positive, and early antigen (EA) was negative. After liver
transplantation, IgG antibody against EA converted to being
positive.
Before liver transplantation, there was no cytopenia in blood
tests. However, pancytopenia developed after liver transplan-
tation. Absolute neutrophil counts were below 200/mL, which
was compatible with severe aplastic anemia. In September
2005, immunotherapy with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG),
methylprednisolone and cyclosporine was performed to treat
aplastic anemia, but it produced little therapeutic effect.

Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation after Posttransplant
Lymphoproliferative Disorder
A 16-yr-old girl received liver transplantation for fulminant hepatitis. Aplastic ane-
mia developed, and she received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
Eleven months after liver transplantation, abdominal lymph node enlargement and
colon ulcers were observed, and colon biopsy showed posttransplant lymphopro-
liferative disorder (PTLD). Immunosuppression reduction was attempted, but it pro-
duced no therapeutic effect. Fourteen months after liver transplantation, she received
a second HSCT due to engraftment failure, and PTLD resolved completely. The
second HSCT can serve as cellular therapy for PTLD.

In January 2006, she received a bone marrow transplant
from an unrelated 39-yr-old Korean man who had 4 HLA
Ag mismatch (CD34: 1.69×106
/kg). The conditioning regi-
men consisted of fludarabine, antithymocyte globulin (ATG)
and cyclophosphamide. ATG depleted T lymphocytes. After
transplantation, immunosuppressive induction was performed
with cyclosporine but engraftment was failed.
Eleven months after liver transplantation, hematochezia
developed. We performed computed tomography (CT) of
the abdomen and colonoscopy in order to find the cause of
hematochezia. Abdomen CT revealed lymph node enlarge-
ment in the mesentery and paraaortic area (Fig. 1). Multiple
aphthoid ulcers were found during colonoscopy (Fig. 2). Colon
biopsy showed monoclonal B-cell proliferation, which was
compatible with polymorphic PTLD (Fig. 3). Positive results
for EBV in situ hybridization (Fig. 4) and immunoglobulin
heavy chain gene rearrangement were obtained. In addition,
EBV DNA was detected by the polymerase chain reaction

Immunosuppression was reduced for the treatment of PT-
LD. Cyclosporine was stopped, and prednisolone (10 mg per
day) was started. However, 12 months after liver transplan-
tation, colon biopsy still showed monomorphic PTLD and a
positive result for EBV in situ hybridization in succession.
Pancytopenia progressed because of engraftment failure.
Fourteen months after liver transplantation (June 2006), she
received peripheral blood stem cell transplantation again from
a 41-yr-old Taiwanese man who had 1 HLA Ag mismatch
(CD34: 3.80×106
/kg, CD3: 9.224×107
/kg). The donor had
positive results for EBV and CMV serologic tests. A combi-
nation of cyclophosphamide, ATG and TLI served as the con-
ditioning regimen. After transplantation, immunosuppres-
sive induction was achieved with cyclosporine. She suffered
from diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, CMV antigenemia and
hemorrhagic cystitis. There was no evidence of graft-versus-
host disease (GVHD).
One month after the second HSCT, complete DNA chime-
rism was achieved, and the result of XX/XY FISH was 0.3%/
99.7%. In addition, abdomen CT revealed that the size of
intra-abdominal lymph nodes markedly decreased (Fig. 5).
Colonoscopy revealed that multiple ulcers in the sigmoid
colon disappeared (Fig. 6). Blind colon biopsy showed non-
specific inflammation. The level of EBV DNA was reduced
to 68.65 copies per reaction.
Twenty months after HSCT, she is still alive under immuno-
suppression with cyclosporine, and there were no lymph node
enlargement on abdomen CT scans.
DISCUSSION
To treat PTLD, various treatment strategies including che-
motherapy, radiation therapy, antiviral therapy, anti-B-cell
monoclonal antibody therapy and modalities for the restora-
tion of EBV-specific cellular immunity, have been employ-
ed. Reduction of immunosuppression remains the first-line
treatment, and many cases of polyclonal PTLD resolved com-
pletely in this manner. However, this was not the case for
monoclonal PTLD. Thus, many other therapeutic trials have
been attempted.
In this case, the patient underwent liver transplantation
due to fulminant hepatitis and also underwent HSCT due
to aplastic anemia. PTLD developed 11 months after liver
transplantation. Immunosuppression reduction was ineffec-
tive in the treatment of PTLD. Recently several studies have
supported the role of rituximab as a second-line therapy for
PTLD (13-15). However, Rituximab was not administered
to the patient because she had severe pancytopenia due to graft
failure. A second HSCT can be effective in the treatment of
PTLD. We hypothesized that HSCT of an unrelated donor,
which contains cytotoxic T lymphocytes presensitized to EBV,
might be an effective treatment method. The patient under-
went a second HSCT from an unrelated donor, and the lesion
of PTLD disappeared.
As mentioned earlier, deficiencies of EBV-specific T-cell-
mediated immunity may cause PTLD. Therefore, treatment
with EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes had been tried.
Recent reports have documented the benefit of cellular thera-
py with EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (16-20). Cyto-
toxic T lymphocytes from the blood of a donor are transfus-
HSCT after PTLD 783

ed into a recipient with PTLD. In this manner, remission of
PTLD has been achieved in as many as 90 percent of patients.
In this case, peripheral stem cells, which the patient received
at the second HSCT, contain T lymphocytes (CD3: 9.224×
107
/kg). The amount of T lymphocytes is larger than that of
donor leukocyte infusion from a previous study (16). A sec-
ond HSCT may serve as cellular therapy with cytotoxic T
lymphocytes for PTLD.
In this case, we have shown that HSCT can treat PTLD
and long-term survival is possible. The mechanism for this
is unclear, but it is thought that HSCT serves as cellular ther-
apy with cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Further investigations
are needed to identify whether HSCT is an available cellular
therapy for refractory PTLD.
