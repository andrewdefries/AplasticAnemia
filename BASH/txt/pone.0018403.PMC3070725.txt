Abstract
The innate immune system plays a pivotal role in the primary defence against invasive fungal infection. Genetic variation
in genes that regulate this response, initiated by pulmonary macrophages, may influence susceptibility to invasive
aspergillosis in patients at risk. We investigated in a clinical setting whether common polymorphisms in Toll-like receptor
(TLR) and cytokine genes involved in macrophage regulation are associated with susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis.
Forty-four allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients diagnosed with probable or proven IA according to the criteria
of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group, were enrolled. The control
group consisted of 64 allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients without invasive aspergillosis. The TLR4 1063A.G
single nucleotide polymorphism was associated with invasive aspergillosis when present in donors of allogeneic stem cell
transplantation recipients (unadjusted OR 3.77 95%CI 1.08–13.2, p = 0.03). In a multivariate analysis, adjusted for
occurrence of graft-versus-host-disease, Cytomegalovirus serostatus and duration of neutropenia, paired presence of the
TLR4 1063A.G and IFNG 874T.A single nucleotide polymorphisms showed a trend towards increased susceptibility to
invasive aspergillosis (p = 0.04). These findings point to the relevant immunological pathway involved in resistance to
invasive aspergillosis and warrant further study of the effects of TLR and cytokine polymorphisms and their interaction,
which may occur on different levels of the complex biological interplay between the immunocompromised host and
Aspergillus sp.

Introduction
It is incompletely understood why some stem cell transplant
recipients develop invasive aspergillosis (IA), a cause of consider-
able morbidity and mortality, while others remain unaffected [1].
Clinical risk factors for the development of invasive fungal
infections (IFI), have been identified, but such risks are not
absolute [2,3]. The host’s or, in case of allogeneic stem cell
transplantation (ASCT), the donor’s genetic signature may
influence susceptibility to acquiring manifest IA or at least affect
its clinical course. Patients with an indication for treatment by an
ASCT-procedure may have diverse hematological malignancies
e.g. acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM),
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), or other diseases. These
hematological disorders are associated with an intrinsic risk of
opportunistic infection, dependent on the stage and extent of the
disease [4]. Furthermore, treatment related factors, most impor-
tantly graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and the duration of
neutropenia, are known to influence the risk for development of
IA [5,6].
In-vitro- and animal studies indicated that the innate immune
system plays a pivotal role in defence against IA by pathogen
recognition and activation of appropriate host defence mechanisms in
pulmonary macrophages [7,8]. A family of pathogen recognition
receptors (PRRs), the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), mediate this process
through detection of fungal components and initiation of intracellular
signalling pathways that lead to a pro-inflammatory cytokine response
[9–13]. Only recently, a number of functional single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR4 as well as in TLR1 and TLR6 genes
were associated with occurrence of IA in ASCT recipients [14–16].
However, the response of the innate immune system relies on a
complex network of components which encompasses TLRs as well
as molecules of signaling pathways (e.g. MyD88 and NFkB) and
subsequently secreted cytokines [17]. Animal studies showed that
depletion of IL-12 and IFN-c delayed pulmonary clearance of A.
fumigatus in mice [18]. Moreover, a high production of IL-12 and
IFN-c had a protective effect [19]. In humans, little is known
about the role of these or other cytokines in the context of innate
or acquired anti-fungal defense mechanisms and only scarce data
is available to validate the clinical and experimental findings so far.
Hence, we investigated the clinical relevance of common genetic
polymorphisms in the TLR-mediated IL-12/IFN-c loop to
macrophage activation with regard to susceptibility to develop-
ment of IA in ASCT recipients.

Methods
Study population
The study cohort consisted of 44 patients with hematological
disorders and diagnosed with either proven or probable IA
following ASCT according to the revised 2008 European
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Mycosis
Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria [20]. All patients were
treated at the Leiden University Medical Center, a tertiary care
and teaching hospital in the Netherlands. Patients were recruited
from the database of the Department of Infectious Diseases. Sixty-
four patients with comparable distribution of hematological
disorders, but who did not develop IA, were enrolled in the
control group. The control patients all received a allogeneic stem
cell transplantation and were recruited for the study from the
database of the Hematology department under the condition that
DNA of the patient and the donor was available for study
purposes. For control patients, the minimum follow-up time had to
be 12 months. The ethnic background was Caucasian in both
groups and all patients had undergone T-cell depleted ASCT.
Demographic and clinical characteristics as well as outcome data
were collected from the hospital’s electronic database. The
duration of neutropenia to the diagnosis of IA was defined as
the number of consecutive days from the first day of a granulocyte
count ,0.56106
cells/L (determined 63 times weekly) to the day
that microbiological evidence of IA was first obtained. The study
was endorsed by the local medical ethics committee. No standard
prophylaxis active against Aspergillus sp. was used. Antifungal
therapy was sometimes initiated on a pre-emptive basis, but always
discontinued within 1 week if a probable or proven fungal
infection was not diagnosed. Clinical characteristics per group are
as summarized in table 1.
Polymorphisms and genotyping
Polymorphisms were considered eligible for study if the SNP
was previously reported to be associated with the occurrence of IA
and had an expected allele frequency of $5% in the population.
With regard to the focus of interest as pointed out in the
introduction, two SNPs reported to influence IL-12p40 and IFN-c
production were additionally included (table 2). Blood- or bone
marrow samples were used to isolate DNA. Genotyping of
polymorphisms was performed by use of a Sequenom MassArrayH
platform according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Sequenom,
San Diego, USA). Multiplex assays were designed using Assay
designer software (Sequenom). In brief, after PCR on 2.5 ng of
DNA a primer extension reaction was performed to introduce
mass-differences between alleles and, after removing salts by
adding a resin, ,15 nl of the product was spotted onto a target
chip with 384 patches containing matrix. Mass differences were
detected using a Bruker Autoflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer
and genotypes were assigned real-time using Typer 3.1 software
(Sequenom). Several samples representing the various genotypes
were sequenced to confirm the genotyping results. As quality
control, 10% of samples were genotyped in duplo; no inconsis-
tencies were observed. Primer sequences are available upon
request.
Statistical analysis
Genotype- and allele frequencies were calculated and compared
between groups by Pearson-chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests.
Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were
calculated for the presence (homozygous or heterozygous) or
absence (homozygous wild type allele) of the selected SNPs. All
polymorphisms were tested for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
Due to the possibility that development of IA was influenced by
SNPs in the donor DNA, genotype and allele frequencies were also
compared between donors of the patients with IA and donors of
control patients. Because of expected redundancy and complexity
in the pathway to granulocyte and macrophage activation, the
relevance of the combined presence of the selected polymorphisms
was assessed in a contingency table. The outcomes were corrected
for GVHD, CMV serostatus of recipient and donor, and for the
duration of neutropenia. Bonferroni correction was not applied as
the SNPs analyzed were each preselected based on clinical
relevance [21]. The influence of a selected SNP on the course of
disease (i.e., duration of neutropenia to day of diagnosis or time
from IA diagnosis to death) was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis
(log rank-test). The SPSS version 17.0 statistical software package
for Windows was used for all calculations.
Results
A total of 10 candidate polymorphisms, all acting within the
type-1 cytokine loop to macrophage activation, were selected for
analysis: five SNPs in three different TLR genes (21,24 and 26)
and five SNPs in the IL10, IL12B and IFNG genes (table 2). The
distribution of genotypes was consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium except for the IL12B SNP. The TLR4 1063A.G and
TLR4 1363C.T SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium, i.e.
when the 1063A.G SNP was found, the 1363C.T was almost
always also present. No significant difference in genotype or allele
frequencies was found between patients with IA and control
patients (data not shown). When comparing donor genotype and
allele frequencies, the TLR4 1363C.T and TLR4 1063A.G
SNPs were more frequently present in donors of patients with IA
(table 3). The donor DNA contained the TLR4 1063A.G SNP in
9 of the 43 case patients (21%) and in 4 (7%) of the 61 control
patients successfully genotyped for this polymorphism (OR 3.77
95%CI 1.08–13.2, p = 0.03). Following multivariate correction for
GVHD, CMV serostatus and duration of neutropenia the adjusted
OR was 3.76 (95% CI 0.90–15.8, p = 0.07). In addition, the allele
frequency of the IFNG 874T.A polymorphism showed a trend
towards association with IA when present in donors of patients
with IA (OR 1.60 95%CI 0.91–2.79, p = 0.10).
Since our hypothesis was that susceptibility to IA by genetic
mutations could be influenced by the interplay of both TLR and
cytokine gene mutations, relevance of the combined presence of
the selected polymorphisms was assessed in a contingency table
(i.e. association of occurrence of IA with the presence of at least
one minor allele in both genes in the interaction term). With
respect to this analysis no significant associations with IA were
found in the comparison of patients with IA versus control
patients. However, a similar analysis performed for the genotypes
of the donor samples revealed that paired combinations of the
TLR4 1063A.G, TLR6 745C.T, or IFNG 874T.A SNPs
correlated with occurrence of IA in the recipient (table 4). After
multivariate adjustment for GVHD, CMV serostatus and
neutropenia, only the association between the TLR4 1063A.G
and IFNG 874T.A combination and IA remained statistically
significant (p = 0.044). When using a forward conditional logistic
regression model for assessment of strength of the association of
individual or paired polymorphisms with IA, incorporating both
the single presence of the minor SNP in the TLR4, TLR6 and
IFNG genes as well as their paired combinations, showed that the
TLR4 1063A.G/IFNG 874T.A combination was most strongly
linked with IA (p = 0.033).
Kaplan-Meier analysis did not reveal significant differences in
time to development of IA between recipients or their donors

bearing either only the wild-type or variant allele. There was no
difference in survival (time to death following diagnosis of IA)
consequent to having one or two minor alleles of the selected SNPs
in either recipients or their donors.
Discussion
We found that in this study cohort the TLR4 1063A.G
polymorphism was associated with increased susceptibility to IA,
when present in the donors DNA of ASCT recipients (alone or in
combination with the IFNG 874T.A SNP). None of the cytokine
polymorphisms alone were linked with occurrence of IA. The
results of our investigations concur with the study by Bochud et al.,
in which the 1363C.T and 1063A.G polymorphisms in the
TLR4 gene were demonstrated to be associated with IA when
present in donors of ASCT recipients [14]. In contrast, an
increased risk for IA was previously reported for the 1063A.G
SNP if present in the recipients DNA but not in the donor DNA
[15]. The association between IA and the TLR1 239G.C SNP or
between IA and the combination of the TLR1 743A.G and TLR6
745C.T SNPs as reported in a smaller study by Kesh et al. [16],
was not confirmed by our data.
The IFNG 874T.A SNP was found to potentially add up to the
risk conferred by two of the TLR polymorphisms. Although
carriers of this genetic variation produce suboptimal levels of IFN-
c, putting them at increased risk for perhaps manifest tuberculosis,
the isolated presence in either donor or recipient did not increase
the risk for IA. Remarkably, SNPs that affect the production of IL-
10, one of the most important broad-acting negative modulators of
the TLR to IL-12 and IFN-c macrophage-activating pathway, did
not influence susceptibility to IA. Absence of IL-10 was
demonstrated to cause increased survival of susceptible mice when
exposed to Aspergillus fumigatus and in a prospective clinical study a
tendency towards protection against IA was detected when the -
1082 A/A-genotype was present [22].
As compared to other risk factors, the absolute risk conferred by
relevant SNPs in PRR- and cytokine genes is likely to be limited,
given the fact that individuals carrying these SNPs do not develop
IA unless another immune deficiency is present. Moreover, our
data indicate that even in hosts most at risk, the ability to maintain
a response to IA is largely unaffected by the studied SNPs,
underscoring the already expected redundancy inherent to the
human antifungal defense [23]. Likely, specific patterns of genetic
polymorphisms rather than a single genetic variation in TLRs or
subsequent cytokine pathways that activate macrophages may be
associated with IA in patients at risk. The observation of the
association between the TLR4 1063A.G plus IFNG 874T.A
SNP combination and IA fits such a hypothesis. However,
probable associations of IA with conditional combinations of
mutations may also attest to the complex immuno-pathogenesis of
invasive aspergillosis. As a consequence of neutropenia, the role of
key components within the innate immune response (e.g. lung
macrophages phagocytosing and eliminating Aspergillus conidia)
could be more prominent in the remaining defense against

invasive fungal infection and thus facilitate linkage to TLR- in
combination with cytokine SNPs. Assuming that the studied SNPs
have an effect on the functioning of the innate immune system,
different SNPs may also be working at different time points to
modulate resistance to IA and eventually constitute the hosts
genetic signature of susceptibility.
Of note, recent publications suggest that components of the
innate immunity, including TLRs, may be linked to the
pathogenesis of hematological malignancies [24–27]. Although
in our study a control group with a comparable distribution of
hematological malignancies was used, this intriguing loop may
complicate the interpretation of studies in this field. Furthermore,
the study has its limitations, e.g. due to a retrospective design and
size of the study cohort. This prevents the incorporation of a larger
amount of variables to correct for in the multivariate analyses (e.g.
duration of follow-up post transplantation). However, two studies

that explored the role of TLR SNPs and risk for IA included a
comparable or even smaller number of patients [15,16]. Of note,
rather than performing a genome-wide analysis, or testing a
random collection of immune genes, we chose to investigate the
association of IA with pre-set polymorphisms in candidate genes
involved in type-1 cytokine loop to macrophage activation. This
ameliorates implications with regard to the concept of multiple
testing [21], but by some a significance level of 0.05 may still be
regarded too liberal. Currently an ongoing discussion about the
necessity of p-value adjustment in exploratory epidemiological
studies still evolves and with all relevant data reported, final
judgment is left to the reader [28,29]. Furthermore, due to the
rapidly evolving research field, producing newly found candidate
SNPs like the Dectin-1 Y238X polymorphism, investigations can
hardly ever be complete [30].
The overall impact of the reported TLR4 1063A.G and IFNG
874T.A SNPs on the risk of IA should be interpreted with care.
Relative risk associations of genetic variations in the case of IA do
not stand alone but likely are influenced again by other
components in the host’s defense. Due to study limitations, the
outcomes were corrected only for known important clinical risk
factors, but not for other variables. As discussed above, the
observations of this study may be accounted for by both a system
of redundancy in the innate immune system as well as by the
complex biological interaction between the immunocompromised
host and the invading fungus. At present, the findings do not
extent to the bedside yet, e.g., by providing guidance for
individualized prophylaxis or early intervention. However, by
further unravelling the interplay between the innate host defence
and Aspergillus sp. through experimental and clinical investigations,
increased comprehension of the underlying immuno-pathogenetic
processes may, in time, translate into insights directly relevant to
clinical practice.
