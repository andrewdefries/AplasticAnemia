(Received for publication, June 8, 1942)
The most significant observations in the tables below relate to hypopro-
teinemia, pregnancy, and the postpartum state. With the reduction of protein
stores which must accompany hypoproteinemia, we observe in practically all
cases that the biological assay of these livers shows only 1/6to 1/~of the normal
store of hemoglobin producing materials.
It is general]y believed that the liver stores many factors essential for hemo-
globin building--for example it holds the major stores of iron and the essential
factor missing in pernicious anemia. We believe that the liver stores some of all
thefactors essentialfor hemoglobin building and it is not difficult to show that the
building of hemoglobin can be limited by reducing protein stores and intake in
experimental anemia (2, 6). This might indicate that the liver is concerned
wifh the production and/or storage of globin or its precursors.
The pigment radicle of hemoglobin--the pyrrol aggregate--we know is dis-
carded by the liver (bile pigment) and possibly the pigment radicle is made in
the same organ. It does not seem possible to exhaust the capacity of the body
to produce this pigment radicle--perhaps the mechanism being a ring closure of
straight chain amino acids.
Some years ago we reported analyses of human livers (12). The iron content
was determined and a biological assay of the hemoglobin-producing factors in
human tissue was made by the utilization of carefully standardized anemic dogs.
Our control baseline for the normal animal liver is that of the pig and we desig-
nate that as 100 per cent. Compared with this 100 per cent normal control we
find that the normal human liver contains greater amounts of hemoglobin-pro-
ducing factors--a ratio of 120 to 160 per cent to the control. There are con-
siderable individual differences which we are inclined to relate to dietary habits,
iron stores, and other unknown factors.
Subsequently we made biological assays upon the livers from common do-
mestic animals (8). Compared with the hemoglobin production resulting from
pig liver feeding as 100 per cent, we found beef liver rated at 70 per cent, rabbit
liver 80 per cent, dog liver 100 per cent, and horse liver 130 per cent. Fish
livers in contrast were relatively inert--perhaps 10 per cent being the upper
limit for the various salt water fish tested (7, 10).

284 HEMOGLOBIN PRODUCTION FACTORS IN HUMAN LIVER
In our study of the biological assays of human livers (12) we observed that the
usual acute and chronic infections showed about the same ratio as did the
normal human group--average figures of 120 to 150 per cent as compared with
100 per cent for the normal control pig liver. Cirrhosis with no sign of liver
insufficiency presented high normal values--160 per cent, but when there was
evidence of a true hepatic insufficiency, the liver assay averaged only 50 per
cent or l/~normal. The iron content was the same in both types of cirrhosis.
Pernicious and aplastic anemias showed large stores of iron and a high assay
for hemoglobin production 220 to 200 per cent. The usual secondary anemias
showed the biological assay to fall within normal range--130 per cent with low
iron values.
Other experiments with anemic horse liver (14) show that it is not easy to ex-
haust the hemoglobin production factors from the liver by means of blood loss.
Iron stores can be reduced very readily by blood removal. These and other ex-
periments suggest that the important reserve stores for hemoglobin building are
in part protein and are guarded jealously by the body even in the face of severe
bleeding. We must diminish the protein intake to reduce this protein fraction
of the hemoglobin production store (6).
Obvious]y a comprehensive understanding of hemoglobin fabrication within
the body in health and disease calls for an analysis of the stores of hemoglobin-
producing materials in animal and human livers. This knowledge may make
for a better therapy in human disease.
Methods
Methods used have been described previously (15). The standard dogs are kept
anemic at a level of 6 to 7 gin. hemoglobin per 100 cc. blood by bleeding and the
hemoglobin removed is credited to that test period. During control periods the dogs
are fed a complete diet--a salmon bread mixture (15) which is poor in iron but ade-
quate for health and general nutritional maintenance indefinitely. The dogs are
standardized by the feeding of pig liver at various times. Similar control tests are
made by feeding iron during other test periods as described elsewhere (11). The
average hemoglobin production due to pig liver feeding (300 gin. per day for 7 days)
is 35 to 45 gin. When the human liver is tested, proper adjustment is made for the
amount of liver used and this is then compared with the pig liver baseline as 100 per
cent. The figures for this ratio are given in the last column in the tables.
In all these test experiments data on red cell counts, hemoglobin levels, blood
volume, and animal condition are available in the histories of the various dogs but
are not given in this report. These dogs were in a normal clinical state at all times.
Iron analyses were made by the method described by Kennedy (3). These figures
are somewhat higher than would be found in perfused livers which give values related
to the parenchyma iron only. Significant clinical diagnoses and a brief description
of the liver are given under the autopsy number.

Histological specimen--liver ceils in margin of lobules show a good deal of fat but little if
any pigment. There is much periportal stroma which is rich in mononuclear cells--the
cirrhosis is probably related to a cholangitis. Liver lobules are distorted but liver cells are in
good condition. The pernicious anemia was under control.
3447. Anemia (pernicious?)--some reticulocyte response to liver therapy--coronary
occlusion with infarct--hemoglobin 8 gm.--74 years.
Liver--autopsy weight 1200 gm.
G. H. WHIPPLE AND F. S. ROBSCJtEIT-ROBBINS 287
Histological specimen--liver cells show atrophy. There are scattered small liver necroses.
A few granules of iron staining pigment are found in liver cells and Kupffer cells. Marrow
shows no typical hyperplasia. If this is pernicious anemia it must be a very early stage.
The picture is not that of the ordinary secondary anemia.
Table 1 presents 10 cases of pernicious anemia, 8 of which are typical and had
received no therapy or inadequate therapy. If we exclude the last 2 cases in
Table 1, we obtain an average ratio of 243 per cent, which means that the per-
nicious anemia liver contains unusually large stores of hemoglobin-building
factors. The missing substance X present in liver extracts, liver, stomach, and
kidney tissue, is lacking and these unused substances pile up in reserve. When
liver therapy is effective these liver stores decrease to normal and ratios close to
the normal are observed (case 4540, Table 1 above) as new red cells are formed
in great numbers.
The last 2 cases in Table 1 show high normal ratios for the hemoglobin-pro-
ducing factors. In 4540 the therapy had been adequate and there was no
anemia at time of death. In case 3447 the anemia was not severe and the
findings suggest an early stage of pernicious anemia.
Table 1 is very like the similar report on pernicious anemia ((13) Table 31).
Average ratios for hemoglobin-producing factors in the liver previously reported
were 218 per cent.

Liver--autopsyweight 1400gm.
Histological specimen--liver ceils show some small fat droplets and lipochrome pigment
but no iron staining pigment. Marrow shows no hyperplasia. Evidently in this type of
anemia the iron and other hemoglobin-buildingfactors are not depleted from the liver--
perhaps the mechanism of hemoglobinproduction is disturbed by the nephritis.

Liver--autopsy weight 1250gm.

gm.--72 years.
Liver--autopsy weight 1800gm.
Histologicalspecimen--liver is negative except for somelipochromepigment in the centers
of the lobules. Bone marrow shows little if any hyperplasia. Iron stores obviously have
been depleted.

Liver--autopsy weight 1540gm.
Histologicalspecimen--liver cellsessentiallynormal and contain a few grains of lipochrome
pigment. Marrow is normal. The reserve of iron and other hemoglobin-buildingmaterials
in the liver has been exhausted.
Table 2 presents various types of anemia and the contrasts are striking not
only in the iron stores but in other hemoglobin-producingfactors. In the usual
type of secondary anemia due to blood loss we expect to find very low iron stores
and a low normal figure for hemoglobin production (135 per Cent in a previous
publication--Table33 (13)). The last 3 cases in Table 2 illustrate well the low
iron stores and also the decreased stores of hemoglobin-producingfactors.
In contrast to these stands aplastic anemia (4395--Table 2), a case with very
G. 1~. WHIPPLE AND F. S. ROBSCI~EIT-ROBBINS 289
large stores of iron and hemoglobin-producing factors. The other aplastic
anemia (6690) possibly due to benzol shows quite large iron stores but only
average stores of hemoglobin-producing factors. This unexpected low value
may be explained in part by a definite hypoproteinemia which tends to reduce
hemoglobin-producing materials in contrast to aplastic anemia which tends to
increase these stores. In part these large stores of iron and hemoglobin-pro-
ducing factors may be related to transfusions. The liver probably stores these
essential hemoglobin-producing factors because the bone marrow is aplastic and
unable to use the stored material in spite of the demand due to the anemia.
Two cases (3958 and 2817 in Table 2) are not easy to understand. In spite
of severe anemia of considerable duration, the liver stores of iron and hemo-
globin-producing factors are large. In advanced nephritis in dogs there may be
a lack of ability to make new hemoglobin under controlled experimental condi-
tions (16). The supplies are adequate but the mechanism for hemoglobin pro-
duction is disturbed just as may happen due to an infection (9). Perhaps this
explains the observed stores (autopsy 2817--Table 2) and their non-utilization
by a bone marrow which appears normal or hyperplastic. The other case of
macrocytic anemia (3958) was observed in a male of 84 and here cachexia may
have been a factor.

Liver--autopsy weight 1740gm.
Histological specimen--liver cells show much fatty degeneration, especially in the centers
of lobules--pigment very inconspicuous. There are a few small focal necroses. Kupffer
cells show an occasional grain of pigment.
Table 3 is probably the most significant in this paper. With hypoproteinemia
in all cases but one there is a sharp drop in the content 6f hemoglobin-producing
factors. In fact if we exclude case 5436 from the group we find an average ratio
of 61 per cent or about 40 per cent of the normal human liver content of hemo-
globin production factors. Anemia is not prominent (excluding 5436) and the
iron stores are depleted. The normal iron values for this type of human liver
material is 12 mg. per cent. We were surprised to note this uniformly low value
for the hemoglobin-producing factors and one can scarcely escape the conclusion
that protein factors (perhaps precursors of globin) are depleted by the hypo-
prf)teinemia whether associated with hepatitis or not.
Case 5436, Table 3, does show a surplus of hemoglobin-building stores and a
normal store of iron in spite of an anemia (hemoglobin 5,5 gm.) plus a severe
hypoproteinemia (4.7 gin. per cent) preceded by a long period of inadequate
,diet (pellagra?) and pye]onephritis. We have no adequate explanation but
note a pyelonephritis which like the nephritis in Table 2 may prevent the
utilization of the hemoglobin-producing stores.

tion of skin, liver, pancreas, and other tissues--cirrhosis--55 years.
Liver--autopsy weight 2350gm.
Histological specimen--liver shows an advanced type of cirrhosis. The liver cells are
filled with granular yellow iron-containing pigment. The same pigment is abundant in
phagocytes and in the scar tissue within the liver. Bone marrow normal.
5812. Thalassemia (Mediterranean anemia)--hemoglobin 3 to 4 gm.--7 years.
Liver--autopsy weight 2550 gm.
Histological specimen--the picture is typical of this disease (17). Liver cells are filled
with granular yellow pigment which gives a strong stain for iron. Kupffer cells are rich in
the same pigment. There is slight increase in stroma but no real cirrhosis.
2414. Thalassemia (Mediterranean anemia)--liver rich in iron pigment--marrow hyper-
plasia--hemoglobin 3.7 gm.--albumin 3.3 gin., globulin 3.4 gm.--typical disease picture as
described by Cooley--5 years.
Liver--autopsy weight 810 gin.
Histological specimen--liver cells very rich in yellow granular pigment staining for iron.
There is central fatty degeneration--no increase in stroma. Kupffer ceils numerous, large,
and full of pigment.
Pigment metabolism is seriously disturbed in the cases listed in Table 4.
Hemochromatosis shows very heavy iron deposits in the liver, no anemia, and a
normal marrow. The biological test of this liver is subnormal in spite of the
very large amount of iron in the liver tissue. The iron alone if available for ab-
sorption should give a response above that recorded. This suggests that the
iron is in a compound (like hemoglobin) not readily available for absorption.
Erythroblastic anemia (Cooley) or Mediterranean anemia or Thalassemia
shows heavy iron deposits, severe anemia, and a very hyperplastic marrow.
One case shows only a normal ratio and another in Table 4 is more than twice
normal. Another case reported previously ((13) Table 35), shows a normal
content of hemoglobin building factors.
Hemolytic icterus presents a pigment disturbance of another type. Blood
destruction is a factor and iron is overabundant in the liver tissue. The bio-
logical assay gives ratio figures somewhat above normal.

294 HEMOGLOBIN PRODUCTION FACTORS IN HUMAN LIVER
Polycythemia (Table 5) shows a low biological assay and a subnormal iron
store. These figures are significant and suggest that the iron and other hemo-
globin-producing factors are turned over very rapidly to form new red cells to
maintain the high red cell counts so characteristic of this disease. An over-
absorption of red cell and hemoglobin-producing factors would not seem to be
responsible for this disease picture. This case had been under observation and
treatment with hydrazine in the Strong Memorial Hospital for 14 years. The
presence of iron in the convoluted tubular epithelium of the kidney is related to
the hydrazine therapy and emphasizes the fact observed in dogs (1) and human
beings that the kidney is an organ concerned at times with iron conservation.
Compare also the iron-containing pigment of the renal epithelium in hemolytic
icterus cases--Table 4.
Leukemia (Table 5) presents an interesting picture. We reported a similar
biological assay on 14 cases ((13) Table 34). In that report the iron content
was about normal and the biological assay showed a ratio of 120 per cent or a
low normal value. There are several factors which may influence the hemo-
globin-producing stores in the liver in this disease. There may be bleeding
which would deplete these liver stores but usually the iron stores are normal or
above (Table 5) indicating that the drain due to bleeding is not serious. The
marrow may be so choked with white cells that it can turn out too few red cells
and anemia results. Meanwhile the stores of iron and hemoglobin-producing
factors may heap up in the liver (case 4283--Table 5). Infiltration of the liver
with white cells and associated liver degeneration may militate against the
storage of protein hemoglobin-producing factors. The iron stores in the cases
of leukemia (Table 5) run from 3 to 20 times normal.

Table 6 presents 3 important cases related to pregnancy. The evidence is
clear from these and other cases reported previously ((13) Table 35), that the
iron and protein stores are very low in late pregnancy. Case 4494 eclampsia
shows hypoproteinemia--compare Table 3. Demands coming from the fetus
are probably largely responsible but the needs for protein due to lactation are
real and deplete protein stores in the liver which otherwise might go to form
plasma protein or hemoglobin.
These observed facts should direct the attention of the clinician to adequate
intake of iron and proteins for the woman in late pregnancy and during lacta-
tion. Whether these depleted protein reserves are in any way related to the
state of eclampsia is not known but protein depletion is known to favor liver in-
jury (5) and impair the defense against infection (4).
The last three cases in Table 6 show control values which are in line with
many others reported earlier (12). Thyrotoxicosis does not cause any change
296 HEMOGLOBIN PRODUCTION FACTORS IN HUMAN LIVER
in the iron content or the biological assay of the liver. Pneumonia likewise
presents figures within the normal range. The last case (hydrocephalus) was a
healthy, well developed male of 16 years--death due to meningitis. The figures
for liver iron are low but the circulating hemoglobin was normal. Biological
assay of the liver shows hemoglobin-producing factors to be below normal pos-
sibly due to some diet limitations.
DISCUSSION
The anemia of leukemia has received a good deal of attention, is a well recog-
nized fact, and might be explained in various ways. Loss of blood is often a
diagnostic factor in leukemia but the observations in Table 5 indicate that in
many cases it is not responsible for the anemia. There are large iron stores and
normal or above normal reserves of hemoglobin-producing factors in the liver.
White cell infiltration of the marrow and liver is probably responsible for the
values recorded in Table 5. When the marrow is stuffed with white cells the
red cell elements can not function properly and there is a tendency toward
anemia with some overaccumulation of hemoglobin-producing factors in the
liver. There is no evidence of lack of absorption of iron or protein factors. In-
filtration of the liver by the leukemic cells may "dilute" the potency of the
liver cells as measured by biological assay. Mechanical or toxic injury due to
infiltration maybe inflicted upon the liver cells and check the storage of proteins
in these cells.
Hypoproteinemia is viewed with disfavor by the clinician with good reason.
That edema may develop needs no debate but there are degrees of hypopro-
teinemia not sufficient to produce edema yet adequate to lower the body de-
fense against infection (4) and toxic liver injury (5). It is probable that such
degrees of hypoproteinemia are more common than is generally appreciated.
The drain coming from the fetus or lactation may cause such plasma protein de-
pletion and therefore deserves the attention of the obstetrician. It should not
be difficult by adequate diet to replete the protein reserve stores. In rare cases
of vomiting plasma could be given by vein to replete these important stores. It
is at least possible that one factor in precipitating the toxic condition desig-
nated eclampsia may be the serious depletion of body protein reserve stores.
The severity of depletion of the protein stores may determine whether the
clinical case of eclampsia does or does not present widespread hyaline liver
necroses.
Hepatitis with jaundice often shows low stores of hemoglobin-producing
factors--both iron and protein (Table 3). Low protein stores and hypo-
proteinemia favor liver injury--a vicious circle--as liver injury tends to slow up
protein production. Obviously a correction of this state is greatly to be desired
and if proteins cannot be given by mouth then plasma protein can be given by
vein or peritoneum. Because methionine has a specificprotective effect against
G. I~. WHIPPLE AND F. S. ROBSC]KEIT-ROBBINS 297
liver injury due to certain poisons (5), it deserves a clinical test where we suspect
a continuing liver injury. Protein by mouth or plasma by vein should also
furnish material needed for the prompt repair of injured liver or other tissues.
SUMMARY
Human liver tissue has been assayed to determine the amount of hemoglobin
production factors in normal and abnormal states. Standardized dogs made
anemic by blood removal have been used in this biological assay. Normal
animal liver as control is rated as 100 per cent.
Normal human liver tissue as compared with the normal animal control
contains more of these hemoglobin production factors--a biological assay ratio
of 120 to 160 per cent. Infections, acute and chronic, do not appear to modify
these values, the concentration of hemoglobin-producing factors falling within
the normal range.
Pernicious anemia and aplastic anemia both show large liver stores of hemo-
globin-producing factors--a biological assay ratio of 200 to 240 per cent.
Therapy in pernicious anemia reduces these liver stores as new red cells are
formed.
Secondary anemia presents a low normal or subnormal liver store of hemo-
globin-producing factors--an assay of 60 to 130 per cent.
Hemochromatosis, erythroblastic anemia, and hemolytic icterus in spite of
large iron deposits in the liver usually show a biological assay which is normal
or close to normal.
Polycythemia shows low reserve stores of hemoglobin-producing factors.
Leukemias present a wide range of values discussed above.
Hypoproteinemia almost always is associated with low reserve stores of
hemoglobin-producing factors in the liver--biological assays of 60 to 80 per cent.
Hypoproteinemia means a depletion of body protein reserve stores including the
labile protein liver reserves--a strong indication that the prehemoglobin ma-
terial (or globin) is related to these liver stores.
Pregnancy, eclampsia, and lactation all may present subnormal liver stores of
hemoglobin-producing factors. Exhaustion of protein stores lowers the barrier
to infection and renders the liver very susceptible to many toxic substances.
It should not be difficult to correct hypoproteinemia under these conditions and
thus relieve the patient of a real hazard.
