OBJECTIVES: To identify the occurrence and the causes of platelet refractoriness in oncohematologic patients.
INTRODUCTION: Platelet refractoriness (unsatisfactory post-transfusion platelet increment) is a severe problem that
impairs the treatment of oncohematologic patients and is not routinely investigated in most Brazilian services.
METHODS: Forty-four episodes of platelet concentrate transfusion were evaluated in 16 patients according to the
following parameters: corrected count increment, clinical conditions and detection of anti-platelet antibodies by
the platelet immunofluorescence test (PIFT) and panel reactive antibodies against human leukocyte antigen class I
(PRA-HLA).
RESULTS: Of the 16 patients evaluated (median age: 53 years), nine (56%) were women, seven of them with a
history of pregnancy. An unsatisfactory increment was observed in 43% of the transfusion events, being more
frequent in transfusions of random platelet concentrates (54%). Platelet refractoriness was confirmed in three
patients (19%), who presented immunologic and non-immunologic causes. Alloantibodies were identified in
eight patients (50%) by the PIFT and in three (19%) by the PRA-HLA. Among alloimmunized patients, nine (64%)
had a history of transfusion, and three as a result of pregnancy (43%). Of the former, two were refractory (29%). No
significant differences were observed, probably as a result of the small sample size.
CONCLUSION: The high rate of unsatisfactory platelet increment, refractoriness and alloimmunization observed
support the need to set up protocols for the investigation of this complication in all chronically transfused patients,
a fundamental requirement for the guarantee of adequate management.

INTRODUCTION
Oncohematologic diseases induce thrombocytopenia and
hemorrhagic manifestations as a result of bone marrow
failure caused by the disease itself and/or by the type of
treatment used (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). In
these cases, platelet transfusion is the main therapy used for
the prevention and treatment of hemorrhagic manifesta-
tions.1
However, about 30% of patients are refractory to
platelet transfusion by presenting an unsatisfactory post-
transfusion platelet increment.2-4
Platelet refractoriness is a result of the shortened survival
of platelets brought about by factors of non-immunologic
and/or immunologic origin. Non-immunologic factors are
involved in about 80% of cases, e.g. sepsis, fever, spleno-
megaly, bone marrow and peripheral blood progenitor cell
transplantation, disseminated intravascular coagulation,
graft-versus-host disease, vaso-occlusive diseases, drug-
induced thrombocytopenia (quinidine, penicillin, sulfa
drugs, heparin, diuretics, and vancomycin) and hemor-
rhages.4,5
The immunologic causes involve antibodies
against the ABO system, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
and/or human platelet antigen (HPA) present on the
membrane of donor platelets.6-8
Despite its clinical relevance, platelet refractoriness is not
routinely diagnosed in services that provide hemothera-
peutic support because of the labor-intensive process
involved and the need for qualified professionals from
various sectors. Thus, the objective of the present study was
to determine the occurrence and causes of refractoriness to
platelet transfusion in oncohematologic patients at the
University Hospital of the Federal University of
‘‘Triaˆngulo Mineiro’’ (UFTM) and at the Regional Blood
Center of Uberaba - HEMOMINAS Foundation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Com-
mittees of the UFTM and of the HEMOMINAS Foundation.
Oncohematologic patients older than 18 years from the
regional university hospital in the fourteen-month period
between March 2008 and May 2009 were included in the
study following informed consent.
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-anticoagulated
blood samples were collected for platelet count before
transfusion2
and 1 hour after transfusion from each patient.
Serum samples were collected before transfusion for the
determination of antibodies and stored at -80˚C until the
time for processing. Samples of the platelet concentrates
(PC) were obtained from the connecting tube of the bag in
sterile conditions for the platelet count of the component.
Personal, clinical and therapeutic data, including the
characteristics of the transfusions received, were obtained
from the medical records of each patient.
Evaluation of the Response to Platelet Transfusion
The response to transfusion was evaluated by calculating
the corrected count increment (CCI) one hour after transfu-
sion as follows: CCI = [(A-B) 6 BS]/C 6 1011
, where A is
platelet count/mL one hour after transfusion, B is the pre-
transfusion platelet count, BS is the body surface (m2
), and C
is the number of transfused platelets (total number present
in the bag). All counts were performed manually after
dilution with ammonium oxalate. Patients were considered
to be refractory when they presented two successive counts
of post-transfusion platelet increments of less than 5,0004
.
Two techniques were used for the detection and
identification of antibodies: the platelet immunofluores-
cence test (PIFT), which identifies the presence of any
antiplatelet antibody (nonspecific test); and the detection
and identification of anti-HLA class I antibodies.
Platelet Immunofluorescence Test (PIFT)
Analysis of patient sera for the presence of antiplatelet
antibodies was done using the flow cytometry PIFT. The
technique was standardized with the characterization of
fluorescence according to a standard curve using the sera of
24 regular male blood donors with no history of previous
transfusions registered at the Blood Center of the State
University of Campinas (UNICAMP).
Briefly, pooled platelets from two O blood group donors
with no history of previous sensitization at the final
concentration of 100,000/mL were buffer washed and
resuspended in 0.1% phosphate buffered saline (PBS)/
EDTA and then incubated with patient serum for 30
minutes at 37˚C. A negative control and a positive control
were added to each test batch. After three consecutive
washes cells were incubated for 50 minutes with fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) goat anti-human immunoglobulin G
(Invitrogen lot 366090A, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After a new
buffer wash, samples were read in a FACScalibur flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) using the
CellQuestH software (Becton Dickinson). For data acquisi-
tion and analysis, 10,000 events were analyzed.
Search and Identification of Anti-HLA Class I
Antibodies
The procedure was carried out by analysis of reactivity
against antigens of the HLA system class I (PRA-HLA) by
flow cytometry using LabscreenTM
kits for the detection of
anti-HLA class I antibodies (LS1PRAH, One Lambda,
Canoga Park, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers
instructions.
Statistical Analysis
The R software version 2.9.1 was used for statistical
analysis. The Fisher exact test was applied to the categorical
variables and the Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests were
applied to the numerical variables, with the level of
significance set at 5% (p,0.05).
RESULTS
Patients Included in the Study
Sixteen prospective oncohematological patients were
included in the study. Seven patients were male (44%) and
nine were female (56%) with a median age of 53 years
(range: 20 to 83 years). Fourteen patients (88%) had a history
of previous transfusion and seven women (78%) had a
history of previous pregnancies (median of 2.5 pregnancies;
range: one to six). Regarding diagnosis, five patients had
acute myelocytic leukemia, four had non-Hodgkin’s lym-
phoma, two had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, one had
acute lymphocytic leukemia, one had non-classified acute
leukemia, one had multiple myeloma and two had myelo-
dysplastic syndrome. Table 1 presents a detailed characteri-
zation of the patients.
Regarding clinical condition, 50% of the patients had
presented with infection in at least one episode, 31% fever,
31% moderate to severe bleeding, 19% a palpable spleen,
13% transfusion reaction, and 13% were taking amphoter-
icin, 6% were taking heparin and 38% vancomycin.
Evaluation of the Transfused Platelet Concentrates
A total of 44 transfusion episodes were evaluated. Of
these, 28 (64%) were random donors PC, 18 of them (64%)

filtered and irradiated, four (14%) only filtered, four (14%)
only irradiated, and two not filtered and not irra-
diated. In 16 episodes (36%), the transfused PC were single
donor apheresis (AP) and all of them were irradiated
(Table 2). There was no significant difference in the number
of irradiated bags for each PC type (p = 0.072). Storage time
was five days or less for all PC.
Incompatible platelets according to the ABO system were
used in only three transfusion episodes, all of them by
apheresis (p , 0.042).
Evaluation of the Response to Platelet Transfusion
Unsatisfactory CCI was found in 54% of the PC transfu-
sions and in 25% of the AP transfusions. This difference was
not significant (p = 0.113; Table 2).
Platelet Alloimmunization
Nine of the 16 subjects studied (56%) presented positive
alloantibody results. PIFT analysis showed that eight
patients (50%) presented positive results, 19% presented
inconclusive results and 31% presented negative results.
Median age was lower among positive individuals (50.5
years; range: 20 to 71 years) compared to negative ones (61
years; range: 36 to 83 years), but the difference was not
statistically significant (p = 0.579). Also, no significant
differences were observed regarding gender (p = 0.431),
gestational history (p = 0.174) or transfusion history (p =
0.247) (Table 3). Of the three positive women (33%), two
(29%) had a gestational history, one of them with a history
of previous transfusions. In the male group, five patients
(72%) had a positive PIFT result. One of them also had a
positive result by the PRA-HLA test. All male patients had
previous transfusion exposure (Table 3).
HLA class I PRA analysis showed positive results in three
patients (19%): one male and two females. There was no
significant difference between groups regarding age (p =
0.32), gender (p = 1.00), history of previous pregnancies (p
= 0.55) or transfusion exposure (p = 1.00). The two positive
female patients (22%) had a history of two and three
pregnancies, respectively, and only one developed platelet
refractoriness. The male patient had a history of 184
transfusions and was also positive by PIFT, as mentioned
previously (Table 4).
Identification of Platelet Refractoriness
Platelet refractoriness was confirmed in three (19%) of the
16 patients evaluated. These patients (all of them female)
presented both non-immunologic and immunologic causes
(two with positive alloantibody tests and the third with an
inconclusive test). The data regarding the three cases of
refractoriness are presented in Table 5.

DISCUSSION
Oncohematologic patients receive repeated platelet trans-
fusions because of their intense and persistent thrombocy-
topenia, with a consequent increased demand for PC which
is not always available through hemotherapy services. This
situation is even more serious when the patient develops
refractoriness to the transfusion of these blood components.
The frequency of refractoriness observed in the present
study (19%) was close to that reported in the literature,
which vary from 24% to 34%.2-4,9
Considering that the
quality of the PC used may influence the transfusion
response,10
a higher frequency of satisfactory increment
was observed in the transfusion of PC obtained by apheresis
(75%), as also reported in other studies.11,12
However, no
significant differences were observed, probably because of
the small sample size. There may be variations as a result of
the method used to obtain PC, type of storage solution,
length of storage and the number of leukocytes present in
the component.4,13,14
It is also important to note that this is a
prospective study carried out in a regional university
hospital over fourteen months and cases of oncohematolo-
gical patients are not very frequent.
The comorbidities present in the patients were those more
commonly related to the lack of an adequate response to
platelet transfusion. Regarding age, the median was lower
among both refractory and alloimmunized individuals.
Although nonsignificant, this difference was also observed
in two other studies4,14
and these facts have been attributed
to greater immunologic activity in younger individuals and
to the senescence of the immune system in the elderly.4
The sensitization of platelet and/or HLA class I antigens
may occur as a result of previous pregnancies or transfu-
sions. The alloantibodies produced may favor an early
removal of platelets from the circulation, compromising the
response to transfusion.4,14
Two of the three refractory
patients had alloantibodies and a gestational history,
supporting literature reports that a history of two or more
pregnancies favors the development of alloantibodies and
the occurrence of refractoriness.4,15
A study involving 66
females demonstrated that 58% of transfused patients with a
history of pregnancy were alloimmunized, as opposed to
only 23% of nulliparous patients.16
The other refractory
patient had two inconclusive PIFTs suggesting alloimmu-
nization with low alloantibody titers, a fact possibly related
to her more advanced age4,14
since, despite no history of
pregnancy, she reported 21 previous transfusions, three of
red blood cells and 18 of PC, a fact that might have
contributed to her refractoriness, in addition to fever as an
additional predisposing factor.
The PRA-HLA test is considered to be highly sensitive
and specific for the identification of HLA class I alloanti-
bodies compared to all other tests.17
Only three patients
(19%) were positive to these alloantibodies. In two patients,
the probable cause of immunization was the history of two
and three pregnancies, respectively, as there was no long
transfusion history. In the third case, the extensive transfu-
sion history (about 184 PC transfusions) of the male patient
definitely favored alloimmunization, especially by exposure
to non-leukocyte-depleted components. Leukocyte deple-
tion removes cells that express allo-antigens, reducing the
exposure to multiple HLA antigens, the number of antigen-
presenting cells and patient sensitization.15
There was no
monitoring of the subsequent transfusions in this patient,
but a larger number of previous transfusions is known to be
related to a smaller post-transfusion increment.4,14
The small number of anti-HLA antibodies observed in the
present study may have been as a result of the leukocyte
depletion of most of the previous transfusions. A study on
platelet refractoriness and alloimmunization demonstrated
that the routine use of leukocyte-depleted PC reduces the
incidence of HLA alloimmunization in the general popula-
tion from 70% to approximately 25%, and the frequency of
allo-immune refractoriness from 15% to 5% among patients
receiving chemotherapy when leukocytes are removed or
inactivated.15
In contrast, the higher frequency of positive results
obtained by the PIFT (50%) compared to the PRA-HLA test
suggest alloimmunization to platelet antigens (HPA) or even
to immunocomplexes or auto-antibodies because of the low
specificity of the test, with labeling of nonspecific antibodies.
Since there is no standardization of platelets regarding the
HLA class I phenotype, this test is less sensitive for HLA class
I antigens. However, in view of its rapid execution and
practical nature, the PIFT is a useful tool for the investigation
of alloimmunization. The presence of alloimmunization to
HPA should be confirmed with more specific tests such as
the Monoclonal Antibody Immobilization of the Platelets
Antigens Assay (MAIPA), which was not used in the present
study. However, this must not be the main cause of positive
results since the literature demonstrates a lower frequency
of alloimmunization to HPA than to HLA antigens.9,16
In
addition, the small number of previous transfusions for males
with a positive PIFT suggests a lack of correlation between
PIFT results and the history of transfusion of these patients,
supporting the hypothesis that at least some of these results
were nonspecific. In agreement with this premise, another
study has also demonstrated greater detection of alloantibo-
dies by PIFT.17
Although the test has low specificity, there is a
lack of studies evaluating the clinical importance of the results
of PIFT in cases of involvement of other alloantibodies or
immunocomplexes and their influence on the response to
platelet transfusion.
In general, 56% (nine) of the patients evaluated presented
alloantibodies, in agreement with two previous studies that
detected frequencies of 66% and 54%, respectively,18,19
although their frequencies were higher than those observed
in other studies which reported frequencies of 7%, 19% and
29%.10,20,21
Among the refractory individuals, the frequency
of alloimmunization was 67%, whereas the literature reports
frequencies of 25 and 43%16,22
. Considering only alloimmu-
nized individuals, the frequency of platelet refractoriness
observed in the present study was 22%, whilst the TRAP15
study detected an inadequate response in 71% of the
alloimmunized subjects.
However, the presence of alloantibodies is not a synonym
of refractoriness and the immunosuppressed condition of
these oncohematologic patients induced both by the under-
lying disease and by chemotherapy should be considered.14
The small sample size limits our comparisons and the
inference of statistical significance. However, we cannot rule
out the relevance of a descriptive analysis of the results,
especially if we consider that each patient should be
evaluated in an individual manner in clinical practice.
Refractory patient 1 presented inconclusive results regar-
ding the determination of antiplatelet alloantibodies and
fever, with the latter being a relevant factor as a cause of
refractoriness. As demonstrated in two other studies, fever

is significantly associated with a low platelet increment.4,14
In this case, refractoriness was transient as the CCI became
satisfactory on the third episode evaluated, when the patient
no longer had fever.
Refractory patient 2 presented five different clinical
complications (fever, infection, splenomegaly and the use
of amphotericin B and vancomycin) and showed alloanti-
body positivity only by PIFT. It is possible that all of these
concomitant conditions affected the transfusion response.
Also, considering the lack of specificity of the PIFT, we still
do not know if, in this case, the transfusion response was
impaired only by the clinical conditions.
Refractory patient 3 had important and persistent transva-
ginal bleeding and infection and had been using vancomycin
for some periods of time; three conditions known to influence
the transfusion response in a negative manner.4,14,15
It is still
uncertain whether hemorrhagic complications interfere
directly in terms of an unsatisfactory response to platelet
transfusion.4,23,24
In addition, an important factor was
alloantibody positivity determined by both PIFT and PRA-
HLA, which certainly contributed to refractoriness.
Other studies have shown that the main patient-related
factors that influence the efficacy of transfusion in a
negative manner are: alloantibody positivity, at least two
pregnancies, fever, infection, use of drugs such as ampho-
tericin B and heparin, and bleeding.4,15,22
Kurz et al. observed that 70% of refractory oncohemato-
logic patients presented clinical conditions or were using
drugs known to affect CCI. In 52% of cases, refractoriness
was associated with infection and most patients had
alloantibodies against platelets25
. The production of alloan-
tibodies can be stimulated during an infectious episode,26
leading us to question whether this mechanism may be
related to the more frequent occurrence of refractoriness in
patients with infections.
Oncohematologic patients typically have clinical condi-
tions and use medications that can interfere with the
response to platelet transfusion.25
The conditions observed
in the three cases of refractoriness were those most
commonly reported in the literature,4,15,22
emphasizing the
importance of determining the causes of refractoriness in
these patients as well as the presence of alloantibodies.
CONCLUSION
The present results demonstrate that alloimmunization
and platelet refractoriness are not uncommon and that each
patient should be assessed with particular attention to the
immunologic and non-immunologic causes of these condi-
tions. Blood services must be made aware of the importance
of the development of measures that will prevent alloimmu-
nization and permit the correct identification of refractoriness
and adequate transfusion support for oncohematologic
patients in order to guarantee the prevention and treatment
of hemorrhagic events common in these patients.
