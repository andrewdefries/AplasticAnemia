Production of RBCs is triggered by the action of erythropoietin (Epo) through its binding to surface receptors (Epo-R) on erythroid
precursors in the bone marrow. The intensity and the duration of the Epo signal are regulated by several factors, including the
balance between the activities of kinesase and phosphatases. The Epo signal determines the proliferation and maturation of
the precursors into hemoglobin (Hb)-containing RBCs. The activity of various protein tyrosine phosphatases, including those
involved in the Epo pathway, can be inhibited by sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4, vanadate). Adding vanadate to cultured
erythroid precursors of normal donors and patients with β-thalassemia enhanced cell proliferation and arrested maturation. This
was associated with an increased production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). Increased HbF in patients with β-hemoglobinopathies
(β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease) ameliorates the clinical symptoms of the disease. These results raise the possibility that
speciﬁc and nontoxic inhibitors of phosphatases may be considered as a therapeutic modality for elevating HbF in patients with
β-hemoglobinopathies as well as for intensifying the Epo response in other forms of anemia.
1. Epo and Proliferation/Maturation of
Erythroid Precursors
Production of RBCs (erythropoiesis) in the bone marrow
depends on the glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (Epo),
which prevents apoptosis and stimulates proliferation of
erythroid precursors [1]. The activity of Epo is mediated
through its binding to speciﬁc surface receptors (Epo-R) [2].
Epo binding induces receptor homodimerization and the
initiation of a stepwise signal transduction process [3]. One
of the earliest responses detected within cells upon ligand-
induced homodimerization is a transient increase in tyrosine
phosphorylation of cellular proteins including the receptor.
Since the EPO-R, like other hematopoietic cytokine recep-
tors, lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity, the receptor must
associate with and activate protein tyrosine kinases in order
to transmit a signal.
Upon Epo binding, EpoR undergoes phosphorylation on
tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain and thereby
recruits diﬀerent SH2-containing signaling molecules, such
as the STATs, Shc, SHP-2, and the p85 regulatory subunit of
PI3K to activate various signal transduction pathways, most
of which are shared with other members of the cytokine
receptor family [4].
Four tyrosine phosphatases are involved in regulating
erythropoiesis. The SH2-domain containing phosphatases,
Shp1 and Shp2, cluster designation 45 (CD45) and protein
tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B) [5]—all modulate activity
of JAK2 kinase. Shp1 associates with Y429 and Y431 [6] and
Shp2 to Y401 of the EPO-R [7]. Several studies have shown
that Shp2 is a robust substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation
by EPO-R, which leads to the recruitment of Grb2-Sos
[8]. Impaired maturation of B−
and T−
cells was described
originally in CD45-knockout mice and further analysis
revealed that CD45 is a JAK phosphatase [9]. Study of the
related tyrosine phosphatases, PTP-1B and T−
cell tyrosine
phosphatase (TC-PTP) reveals that these enzymes trap
substrates with a dityrosine motif. PTP-1B targets Tyk2 and
2 Journal of Signal Transduction
JAK2 [10] whereas the related TC-PTP binds JAK1 and JAK3
[11]. These data indicate that these tyrosine phosphatases
have unique reactivity towards JAK kinase dephosphor-
ylation.
Another manner of desensitization involves the regu-
lation of metabolic intermediates of inositol. Phosphat-
idylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate activates many crucial
signaling events. Several enzymes dephosphorylate it, includ-
ing phosphatase and tensin homolog (which dephospho-
rylate the 3 phosphate) and SH2-inositol phosphatase,
SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 (which dephosphorylate the 5 phos-
phate). SHIP-1 is recruited to the EPO-R [12], and SHIP-1
null mice show elevated formation of erythroid progenitors
in bone marrow [13]. SHIP-1 negatively regulates B−
cell,
macrophage, and mast cell signal transduction pathways
(reviewed in [14]). Further analysis of the erythroid lineage
of SHIP-1-deﬁcient mice is needed to determine whether
loss of SHIP-1 aﬀects Erk1/2 and PKB/Akt activation, as
postulated in other lineages.
The activity of Epo is mediated through its binding
to speciﬁc surface receptors (Epo-R; [2]). Epo binding
induces receptor homodimerization and the initiation of
a stepwise signal transduction process [3]. The Epo signal
is regulated by several factors. (A) The concentration of
Epo. Epo is produced by the kidneys in response to
hypoxia [1], secreted into the blood stream, and inter-
acts with erythroid progenitor/precursor cells in the bone
marrow. Physiologically, ﬂuctuations in the level of Epo
regulate the RBC number under conditions of hypoxia such
as at high altitudes. Pathologically, increased Epo causes
secondary polycythemia [15] whereas decreased production
of Epo causes anemia (e.g., in patients with chronic renal
failure) [16]. (B) The density of Epo-R on erythroid pre-
cursors that is downregulated during erythroid maturation
[17]. (C) The stimulating activity of kinases that induce
tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins in the Epo
signaling pathway [18]. A single-base somatic mutation in
the gene of one of these kinases, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2),
was reported to be responsible for autostimulation of the
pathway, causing Epo-independent growth of erythroid cells
in polycythemia vera [19]. (D) The inhibitory activity of
phosphatases that downregulates the signal, causing it to
be transient and dependent on continuous Epo binding
[20].
The intensity and duration of the ERO signal regulate the
balance between the rates of proliferation and maturation
of the erythroid precursors. At early stages of development,
when the signal is intense due to abundance of Epo-R
[17], proliferation prevails. As the density of the receptors
drops, the intensity of the signal weakens, and maturation
overcomes. The concentration of Epo, as well as other
cytokines such as the stem cell factor (SCF), also aﬀects the
intensity of the signal and, thereby, the rate of maturation.
High concentrations of these cytokines delay maturation,
increase proliferation/ampliﬁcation, and result in a high cell
yield [21]. The intensity of the Epo signal also depends on the
balance between the activities of kinases and phosphatases in
the Epo pathway [18].
2. Inhibition of Phosphatases:
Effect on Proliferation/Maturation of
Erythroid Precursors
The activity of various protein tyrosine phosphatases, includ-
ing those involved in the Epo pathway, can be inhibited
by sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4, vanadate; [22]) and
thereby downregulates the signal. Pervanadate compounds
are the most potent inhibitors of cellular protein tyrosine
phosphatases [23]. As oxidants, their mode of action prob-
ably involves oxidation of a cysteine residue in the active
site of tyrosine phosphatases [24]. Treatment of cells with
vanadate perturbs the equilibrium of tyrosine phospho-
rylation/dephosphorylation, causing elevated protein phos-
phorylation. In the insulin receptor, vanadate mimics the
lipogenic eﬀect of insulin via activation of the insulin recep-
tor tyrosine kinase [23], resulting in the phosphorylation of
cellular substrates [25]. In T−
cells, it was shown to mimic
events mediated by activation of the T−
cell antigen receptor
[26, 27] and to activate intracellular signaling pathways
mediated by the interleukin-2 receptor [28], STAT1 [29] and
the MAP kinase pathway [30].
It was reported that treatment with vanadate of the Epo-
dependent HCD57 murine cell line resulted in increased
tyrosine protein phosphorylation. Vanadate acted synergis-
tically with Epo to stimulate DNA synthesis and prevented
apoptosis following Epo withdrawal without promoting pro-
liferation [31, 32]. It also delayed apoptosis in primary
human erythroid progenitors [31]. Vanadate was also shown
to act on normal erythroid progenitors as a phosphatase
inhibitor that potentiates the kinase activity induced by Epo
and SCF. This function was, however, reduced in poly-
cythemia vera cells [33].
We investigated the eﬀect of vanadate on the proliferation
and maturation of human erythroid precursors in culture
[34]. For this purpose we used the two-phase liquid culture
protocol [35]. In the ﬁrst, Epo-independent, phase of this
protocol, peripheral blood mononuclear cells are cultured
for 1 week with various growth factors but in the absence
of Epo. During this phase, early erythroid committed
progenitors, erythroid burst-forming units, proliferate and
diﬀerentiate into late, erythroid colony forming unit-like,
Epo-dependent, progenitors. In the second phase, the latter
cells, cultured in an Epo-supplemented medium, continue
to proliferate and diﬀerentiate, eventually maturing into
hemoglobin (Hb)-containing orthochromatic normoblasts
and enucleated erythrocytes. When vanadate was added to
cells derived from normal donors, cell proliferation was
enhanced as indicated by studying the growth kinetics and
the distribution in the cell cycle phases. On the contrary,
maturation was arrested, as indicated by cell morphology,
the rate of appearance of Hb-containing cells, and the
pattern of expression of surface antigens (CD117, CD71, and
glycophorin A) [34].
3. Maturation Arrest in Erythroid Precursors
Maturation arrest of hematopoietic precursors occurs in
acute leukemia. Maturation arrest of erythroid precursors is
Journal of Signal Transduction 3
a common phenomenon in β-thalassemia. In this disease,
due to hereditary mutations, the expression of the β-globin
gene is reduced or abolished. This results in a relative high
content of α-globin, which forms tetramers that precipitate
and damage the erythroid cell. Although maturation arrest
causes expansion of the erythroid precursors in the bone
marrow and in extramedullary sites, such as the liver
and spleen, the output of mature RBCs is decreased due
to ineﬀective erythropoiesis. The latter involves premature
apoptosis of erythroid precursors. Although this condition
was extensively studied in patients [36] and in mouse models
of β-thalassemia [37, 38], its causes in thalassemia are not
entirely clear. It could be related to the following: (A)
the reduced production of β-globin which, consequently,
results in imbalanced production of α-globin, (B) reduced
heme synthesis which modiﬁes the activity of the heme-
regulated eIF2 alpha kinase which controls protein synthesis
by phosphorylating the α-subunit of eukaryotic transla-
tional initiation factor 2 (eIF2 alpha) [39], (C) ineﬃcient
elimination of free radicals, which are increased in tha-
lassemia as a result of iron overload [40], (D) the hypoxia-
induced overproduction of Epo which is the result of the
severe, chronic anemia. Serum-Epo is high in these patients
although it does not reach the high levels corresponding
to the degree of anemia [41] (as compared to other forms
of anemia such as aplastic anemia). This could be due to
increased consumption of Epo by the large erythroid mass.
The increased Epo signal may lead to increased proliferation
of erythroid precursors bearing a phosphorylated form of
JAK2, which, in pathological conditions, may lead to a delay
in cell maturation.
4. Inhibition of Phosphatases:
Effect on Hemoglobin Production
We have found that addition of vanadate to cultures of
erythroid precursors derived from normal donors as well as
from patients with β-thalassemia increased the proportion
of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) compared to untreated cells [34].
HbF, which is composed of two chains of alpha-globin
and two chains of gamma-globin (α2γ2) is the major Hb
during embryonic life. It is replaced after birth by adult Hb
(HbA; α2β2, [42]). This Hb switch is recapitulated to some
extent postnatally during the development of erythroid cell
in the bone marrow; HbF production is relatively abundant
in early precursors, and as the cells mature, progressively
decreases due to rapid synthesis of HbA [43], suggesting
that a strong Epo signal favors HbF production. Elevated
levels of HbF in post-natal life may be acquired, such as
in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia [44] or during acute
erythropoietic stress [45], and are frequently observed in
inherited blood disorders such as β-thalassemia and sickle
cell anemia [46]. Increased HbF in these diseases ameliorates
the clinical symptoms of the underlying disease [47, 48].
In β-thalassemia, elevated HbF compensates partially for
the deﬁciency in β-globin chains and balances the excess
of α-globin chains. In sickle cell anemia, not only do HbF-
containing cells have a lower concentration of sickle Hb, but
HbF inhibits polymerization of this Hb directly, accounting
for the lower propensity of such cells to undergo sickling
[49–51]. Various agents have been shown to augment HbF
production, and one of them, hydroxyurea, is currently in
clinical use for treatment of these diseases [52].
The mechanisms by which drugs stimulate HbF are not
known. Two broad hypotheses have been explored. One is
based on drug-induced modiﬁcations of the DNA due to
hypomethylation of globin promoter regions [53], inhibition
of histone deacetylases [54], or activation of responsive
regions, such as following binding of butyrates to a speciﬁc
region of the Aγ-globin promoter [55]. The other mechanism
involves modiﬁcation of the cell cycle kinetics [56] and
the rate of diﬀerentiation of erythroid progenitors [57, 58].
Observations of elevated HbF during erythropoietic stress
[45] suggest that the rate of erythroid maturation and
the intensity and duration of the Epo signal aﬀect HbF
production. Some studies [59, 60], but not all [61–63],
showed that high-dose Epo treatment of primates [64, 65]
and patients with β-hemoglobinopathies caused an elevation
in HbF. We have previously shown that culture of erythroid
cells in the continuous presence of low Epo reduced cell yield
but did not aﬀect the proportion of HbF. However, reducing
Epo levels midway through the culture period, lowered cell
yield, accelerated maturation, shortened the period of HbA
production, and, consequently, increased the proportion of
HbF [21]. In another study, we found that supplying early
erythroid cultures with exogenous hemin (heme chloride)
resulted in high HbF in the mature cells [66]. The eﬀect of
hemin, which is a rate-limiting factor for hemoglobinization
in early precursors, may be related to the ﬁnding that when
supplied with exogenous hemin, the precursors initiated Hb
production earlier with HbF predominating. SCF, which
delays cell maturation, was also shown to enhance HbF
production in cultures of erythroid cells [8, 67–69]. A direct
involvement of phosphatases in stimulation of HbF accu-
mulation was reported by Aerbajinai et al. who examined
the pathway of γ-globin synthesis stimulation by SCF. It was
found that COUP-TFII a repressor of γ-globin gene was sup-
pressed by SCF through phosphorylation of serine/threonine
phosphatase (PP2A) and correlated well with HbF induction
[70].
In summary, the phosphatase-inhibitory compound
vanadate delays maturation of erythroid precursors and po-
tentiates their ability to produce HbF (Figure 1). The latter
eﬀect may be beneﬁcial for patients with β-hemoglobin-
opathies, since increased level of this Hb was found to
ameliorate the clinical symptoms of the underlying dis-
ease. Vanadate, in the form of sodium metavanadate, has
been tested in clinical trials for treating both insulin- and
noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [71, 72]. In in vitro
studies vanadate was shown to reduce the number and Hb
content of erythroid cells [34], and therefore it is not suitable
for treatment of anemic patients. However, other more
speciﬁc and less toxic inhibitors of phosphatases may be
considered as a new therapeutic modality for elevating HbF
in patients with β-hemoglobinopathies as well as intensifying
the Epo response in other forms of anemia.

Figure 1: The eﬀect of phosphatases on the proliferation/maturation of erythroid precursors and their fetal hemoglobin content. The
kinetics of maturation and hemoglobinization in developing erythroid cells depends on the Epo signal. This is modulated by the level of
erythropoietin (Epo), produced in response to hypoxic conditions, the number of erythropoietin-receptors (Epo-R), and the balance in the
activities of kinases and phosphatases. (a) Binding of Epo causes Epo-R homodimerization and activation of the receptor-bound tyrosine
kinase JAK2. Transphosphorylation of JAK2 results in activation of JAK2 and tyrosine phosphorylation (symbolized by the red arrows)
of proteins (e.g., STATs), including the cytoplasmic domain of the EPO-R. Negative regulation of the Epo stimulus involves the tyrosine
phosphatases CD45, PTP-1B, and Shp1. CIS and SOCS3 compete for STAT5 binding at Y401 whereas SOCS1 and SOCS3 bind to the
activation loop of JAK2. Regulation of phosphoinositide metabolism by PI 3-kinase and SHIP1 is also indicated. Activation of the EPO-R
supports survival, proliferation, and maturation of erythroid precursors. (b) Early erythroid precursors (left) carrying a large number of Epo-
R are stimulated by Epo. The strong Epo-signal drives the cells to undergo proliferation and maturation. As maturation proceeds (right), the
cell size and the number of Epo-R decrease, and while total Hb accumulates (red color), the proportion of HbF (%HbF) decreases. Addition
of a phosphatase inhibitor (e.g., vanadate) to early erythroid precursors blocks phosphatase activity (lower panel, marked by X), resulting in
continuous high Epo signaling and inhibition of cell maturation. The latter is accompanied by a relatively high proportion of HbF.
