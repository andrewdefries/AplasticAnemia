Dysfunction of suppressor cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of immunode-
ficiencies (1), aplastic anemia (2), recurrent fungal infections (3), and autoimmunities
such as systemic lupus erythematosus in humans (4), and its equivalent in the NZB
mouse (5). In addition, evidence is accumulating that suppressor cells of lymphoid and/
or macrophage origin may appear during the course of tumor growth both in rodents (6-
8) and humans (9, 10).
Suppressor T cells can be induced by soluble (11, 12) and cell associated antigens (11,
13) and by .concanavalin A (Con A) (14, 15). In some murine models it has been clearly
demonstrated that the suppressor T-cell activity is genetically restricted in that the cell
that is being suppressed, either directly or through suppressor factors, must share an I
region component of the m~jor histocompatibility complex with the suppressor cell (12,
13, 16). We describe here what we believe to be the first example of a genetically-
restricted suppressor T-cell activity in man.
Materials and Methods
Venous blood mononuclearcells were prepared from donors by defibrinationand centrifugation
over a cushion of Ficoll Hypaque (F-H) followed by three washes before suspension in Eagle's
minimal essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated flesh normal male serum, 100 U of
penicillinand 100 ~g streptomycin/ml, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 2 mM fresh glutamine.
Lymphocytes to be used as stimulator cells in mixed leukocyte culture (MLC) were irradiated
with a e°Cosource to 2,250 rads. Triplicate samples of 125,000responder cells were incubated in a
final vol of 0.2 ml with either 125,000 irradiated stimulator cells for 6 days or with a 1:800
dilution of PHA-P (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) or concanavalin A (10 ~g/ml, Sigma
Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) for 3 days. The cultures were pulsed with 0.5 ~Ci of [3H]TdRfor
the final 18 h of incubation before harvesting by the multiple sample harvester onto glass fiber
filters for liquid scintillationcounting (17).
For the fractionation of the mononuclear cells into T or non-T-cell subpopulations (18), the
cells were resuspended in medium at 0.83 x 10e/mlfinal concentration containing 10 mM Hepes
buffer and 32% fetal calf serum with a 50:1 ratio of sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) per lymphocyte
and incubated at room temperature overnight in a 5% CO~ atmosphere to form spontaneous
SRBC rosettes. Cell pellets were gently resuspended, samples removed for enumeration of
rosettes, and the remainder gently underlaid with F-H and centrifuged. The pellet and the
interface were collected separately, and beth were treated with 0.83% Tris-NH4Cl to lyse the
remaining SRBC. The unfractionated cells were treated in a similar fashion with the omission of
SRBC in the medium. The fraction that remained at the interface after centrifugation over F-H
was designated non°T (T-depleted), and the fraction that pelleted was designated T cells (T-
enriched).

Results
In our studies of the immune function of cancer patients (17), the pattern of
response illustrated in Table I has been not infrequently observed. Bladder
cancer patient C.H. had a decreased response to both mitogens and allogeneic
cells when compared to the level of response of normal individuals. In addition,
his leukocytes stimulated normal donor C.D. only weakly while adequately
stimulating three other normal donors, which is generally interpreted as a
one-way MLC (19) typing match. However, in these experiments, the dose of
stimulator cells was also titrated. Unexpectedly, leukocytes from patient C.H.
produced a reciprocal pattern of stimulation distinct from that usually seen in
MLC, i.e., as the number of stimulator cells was increased, the weak response
of normal C.D. decreased (Table II). Yet, on the same day, when the patient's
cells were used to stimulate lymphocytes of other normal individuals, they
induced perfectly normal dose-response patterns (cf. normal stimulator cells
S.D. and B.D. Table II). Since patient C.H. stimulated lymphocytes from some
normal individuals well and yet apparently suppressed other normals, we
suspected that his leukocytes might contain both competent stimulator cells as
well as a population of suppressor cells which were acting in a restricted fashion.
To test this hypothesis, the patient's leukocytes were depleted of T cells by removing SRBC
rosetting cells (18) to determine whether the T.depleted lymphoid cells would stimulate lympho-
cytes from a normal individual who did not respond to the unfractionated cells (Table III). The
unfractionated cells and the T-enriched cellsfailed to stimulate significant blastogenesis in the
suppressiblei normal responder lymphocytes, but rather exhibited the reciprocal dose-response
pattern, i.e.,decreasing stimulation with increasing numbers of stimulating cells.However, the
patient's T-depleted (non-T) cellswere as effectivein stimulating that suppressible normal donor
as were comparable cellsfrom an unrelated normal individual.
Since the patient's non-T-cell fraction was capable of stimulating both
suppressible and nonsuppressible responders, we next examined whether the
patient's T cellswere actively interfering with the abilityof lymphocytes from
the suppressible normal to respond to allogeneic stimuli (Table IV). For this
1 For clarity of presentation, normal donors whose leukocytes responded only weakly and with
a reciprocal dose-response pattern to this patient's stimulator leukocytes in one-way MLC were
designated as suppressible normals, whereas those normal donors responding to his stimulator
cells in a normal fashion are designated nonsuppressible.

experiment, unfractionated lymphocytes from a suppressible and from a non-
suppressible individual were used as responding cells. These cells were stimu-
lated by the irradiated non-T-cell fraction from several allogeneic normal
individuals in one-way MLC with or without the patient's irradiated T cells
added as modulator cells. Clearly, the patient's cells abrogated the responsive-
ness of the suppressible normal to this battery of allogeneic stimulator cells,
but did not interfere with the response of nonsuppressible normal donors.
Similar experiments (data not shown) showed that this patient's lymphocytes
1458 BEAN ET AL. BRIEF DEFINITIVE REPORT
also depressed the response of the same suppressible normals to mitogenic
stimulation.
Blood leukocytes from this particular patient have been used as stimulator
cells in the experimental protocol shown in Table I with leukocytes from 27
different unselected normal individuals as responder cells. Deficient stimulation
of these normal leukocytes by the patient's stimulator cells similar to that
shown in Table I was seen in only three cases. In 11 of these 27 normal
combinations, the patient's leukocytes as stimulator cells were titrated to
determine the dose-response curve. Only in MLC with those same three
normals did his stimulator cells produce the reciprocal pattern of a further
reduction in stimulation with increasing numbers of stimulator cells identical
to that shown in Table II. In 12 experiments similar to that shown in Table IV
we used the patient's irradiated cells as modulator cells in one-way MLC with
normal donor lymphocytes as responder cells. In each of the 12 experiments,
his cells suppressed only the reactivity of leukocytes obtained from those three
normals. In five of these experiments, enrichment of E-rosetting cells was
performed and these cells were suppressive, whereas the T-depleted cells were
not.
In an attempt to clarify whether this restriction in suppressor activity was
under genetic control, as reported in the animal models, HLA typing of the
patient and the three suppressible normals was performed. The serological
typing data are at present inconclusive as the patient did not type for the HLA-
B locus2 and reagents for human Ia typing were not available.
As another approach to establishing whether this T-cell suppression was
genetically restricted, we reasoned that if there were a genetic restriction, the
lymphocytes of one or both parents of each of the suppressible normals should
be suppressed by the patient's lymphocytes. We were able to test the natural
parents of two of the suppressible normal donors in an experimental design
similar to that shown in Table IV. Unfractionated lymphocytes from both the
mother and father of each of those two donors were stimulated with several
different allogeneic leukocytes to induce a MLC response. The patient's and
unrelated normal donor's irradiated leukocytes were then added as modulator
cells. The results showed that only one parent of each of the suppressible
normals was suppressed by the patient's leukocytes. Thus, there appeared to
be a probable genetic restriction to the expression of this suppressor activity,
although at present the gene or linkage group with which the suppression is
associated remains to be established.
Discussion
The present results suggest that genetic restriction on T-cell suppression
may exist in humans as well as in mice. At present, it is not possible to
estimate the frequency of this phenomenon in cancer patient populations or
speculate whether it is disease-related. The data reported here are from the
study of a male patient who had not had transfusions or chemotherapy and
who continues to have recurrent bladder carcinomas. We have subsequently
found a second patient who has allergic asthma who exhibits this type of

restricted suppressor activity intermittently. Addition of his leukocytes as
third party cells to MLC reactions depressed the ability of leukocytes from one
normal donor but not others to respond to unrelated allogeneic stimulator
cells. When his leukocytes were used as stimulator cells in MLC, they produced
the reciprocal pattern of stimulation against that one normal donor but not
others.
This finding of a genetically-restricted T-suppressor activity in man supports
the generality of similar recent findings in animal models (12, 13, 16). The
present experiments also emphasize the difficulties in detecting suppressor
cells in man when the activity may be restricted and, thus, detectable only
with normal indicator (responder) leukocytes from a small percentage of
randomly selected individuals, except in the rare event that the subject being
tested for suppressor cells has an identical twin or both parents living, healthy,
and geographically available. Obviously, more studies are required to establish
whether this apparently genetically-restricted suppression is linked to the
HLA complex and related to the incidence and course of disease.
Summary
Blood leukocytes from an immunologically hyporesponsive patient with
urinary bladder carcinoma were found to be deficient in their ability to
stimulate 3 of 27 responder leukocyte preparations from normal individuals in
one-way mixed leukocyte culture (MLC). The patient's T-depleted leukocytes,
however, functioned adequately as stimulator cells. T-enriched lymphocytes
from this patient suppressed the MLC responsiveness of those three normals
but not the responsiveness of other normals. The patient's cells suppressed the
MLC responsiveness of only one of each of the parents of two of the normals
who could be suppressed by the patient's leukocytes suggesting a possible
genetic restriction to this suppressor cell activity.
