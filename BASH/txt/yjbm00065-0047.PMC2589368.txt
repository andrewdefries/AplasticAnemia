Hematopoietic growth factors have now been purified, cloned, and produced in bacteria and
yeast. Those that are currently in clinical study include erythropoietin, GM-CSF, G-CSF,
M-CSF (also called CSF-1), and multi-CSF (also called interleukin 3). Growth factors appear
likely to enhance the recovery and function of circulating white cells after standard-dose cancer
therapy and high-bone-dose cancer therapy with marrow transplant and to restore leukocyte
numbers and competence in the acquired immune deficiency syndromes and myelodysplastic
syndromes. Phase I, II trials in AIDS, in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, in cases of
myeloproliferative disease, and after bone marrow transplant have been published. The results of
phase III studies arejust becoming available.
REGULATION OF NORMAL WBC PROLIFERATION AND FUNCTION
In Vitro Studies
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a major hor-
monal regulator of human granulopoiesis [1,2,3]. GM-CSF enhances both prolifera-
tion of myeloid precursor cells and the function of mature peripheral blood neutrophils
and mononuclear phagocytes. (Refer to Table 1.) GM-CSF is a protein that acts in
picomolar concentrations to stimulate colonies of differentiated granulocytes and
monocytes in semisolid media [3,13]. Complementary DNA clones encoding GM-CSF
have been isolated, and recombinant human (rh) GM-CSF produced [13]. This
material possesses biologic activity for the development of granulocytes, mixed granu-
locyte-macrophage, pure eosinophil, and multipotent mixed cell progenitor colonies
from both normal bone marrow and human myeloid leukemia cell lines, HL-60 and
KG-I [14,15]. GM-CSF also stimulates the growth of human erythroid burst-forming
units (BFU-E) in the presence of erythropoietin when adherent and E-rosette forming
cells are removed from preparations [14,16]. GM-CSF is a weak but consistent inducer
of differentiation in HL-60 cells, resulting in increased numbers of cells displaying
monocytic and eosinophilic characteristics [15].
GM-CSF has neutrophil migration-inhibition activity and has been previously
described as a neutrophil migration-inhibition factor from T-lymphoblast cell lines
[3,17]. In functional studies, GM-CSF stimulates superoxide anion generation in
response to the bacterial chemoattractant, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine
[17]. Thus, GM-CSF stimulates growth of myeloid precursor cells and augments
neutrophil oxidative metabolism important in neutrophil microbicidal and tumoricidal
activities [16].
GM-CSF induces cellular activities after binding with specific high-affinity recep-

tors on the plasma membrane of responding granulocytes and macrophages. Specific
binding to high-affinity saturable cell surface receptors occurred on two human cell
lines that exhibit proliferative responses to GM-CSF (KG-1, an acute myelocytic
leukemia [AML] cell line, and HL-60, a promyelocytic cell line.)
Thus, granulocytes exposed to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or
GM-CSF appear to be primed for activation and more efficient in killing bacteria. In
some patients, migration into a sterile skin window appears to be suboptimal after
GM-CSF but not during G-CSF administration.
In Vivo Primate Studies
Recombinant human (rh) GM-CSF, administered intravenously (iv) or subcutane-
ously over seven to 30 days to non-human primates [18], have demonstrated dose-
dependent increases in total peripheral white blood cell (WBC) counts (predominantly
increases in the absolute numbers of mature neutrophils, neutrophilic basophils, and
eosinophils, with less consistent increases in platelets and occasionally lymphocytes).
Depending upon the method of administration, the total peripheral WBC has
increased as early as 48 to 72 hours after beginning administration of GM-CSF,
associated with bone marrow hyperplasia of the appropriate cell lines. In one study,
peripheral blood neutrophils obtained during treatment with GM-CSF exhibited
morphologic and functional changes associated with cellular priming for activation
(increased superoxide anion generation and enhanced phagocytosis of opsonized E.
coli).
With the exception ofcutaneous flushing in some animals, fever in one animal during
and immediately after administration, and the development of specific antibodies to
human GM-CSF, no clinically significant adverse reactions were noted in any of the
non-human primate studies. Doses ranged from 2-176 ,g/kg/day of protein (4-300
,ug/kg/day of glycoprotein) equivalent to 0.06-7.2 x 105 units/kg/day of activity
(measured as the stimulation of 3H-thymidine uptake by peripheral blood cells from
patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia [CML].
Dose-response was evaluated by administration of 0 (vehicle only), 5, 15, 30, or 60

five consecutive days. Significant increases in WBC counts were observed in all animals
within one week, with the maximal WBC observed at 15 ag/kg. Both subcutaneous

and intravenous administration resulted in comparable increases in WBC count.
(Refer to Table 2.)
The optimal schedule of GM-CSF seems to be 5 ,tg/kg/day subcutaneously twice a
day. Intravenous bolus schedules are associated with poor efficacy. High peak levels are
associated with shortness of breath at the initial treatment. Higher doses result in an
increased incidence of pericarditis [19,20].
LEUKEMIA
Growth factors are being studied as agents to synchronize leukemic cells in patients
with refractory acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) prior to high-dose cytarabine [21].
In other studies, GM-CSF is being given after reinduction therapy in refractory
patients [22] or in newly diagnosed AML patients at high risk [22,23] in order to
attempt to decrease the period of aplasia. One patient treated with GM-CSF for
idiopathic neutropenia normalized his WBC and was found to have hairy cell leukemia
[24]. (Refer to Table 3.)
The results ofclinical trials so far suggest that GM-CSF should enhance the activity
of a phase-specific cytotoxic drug against AML. In subsets of patients with AML,
G- and GM-CSF result in an earlier than expected recovery compared to historical
controls. Whether the fraction of AML patients who have regrowth of leukemic cells
after induction is increased by treatment with GM-CSF or G-CSF is not known. One
randomized trial of 98 patients describes a significantly shorter recovery after induc-
tion treatment, significant decrement in the number of infections, and a complete
response rate of 50 percent in the group receiving GM-CSF (versus 38 percent
complete responses in the group randomized to placebo). G-CSF alone and with
interferon has been used in patients with hairy cell leukemia and neutropenia with
substantial increases in granulocyte count. The white count in one patient treated with
GM-CSF for a diagnosis of aplastic anemia increased from 1,700 to 5,600 with the
appearance of hairy cells (presumably the etiology of his prior neutropenia).

APLASTIC ANEMIA
In aplastic anemia, the number of patients with WBCs "responding" to GM-CSF
has ranged from one in four patients to ten of 11. Increased white counts ranged from
1.6- to tenfold increase in improvement. In the only randomized trial, a small study of
seven patients, the four patients randomized to GM-CSF responded. The three control
patients also responded when they were crossed over after failure to respond to placebo.
(Refer to Table 4.)
MYELODYSPLASIA
Significantly increased leukocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes, and eosino-
phils were observed (as well as platelets and reticulocytes in a few) in patients treated
with GM-CSF generally for at least two weeks. Toxicity includes bone pain as well as
sporadic fever, chills, myalgias, headache, and anorexia. (Refer to Table 5.)
In laboratory studies ofgranulocytes from patients with myelodysplasia, G-CSF and
GM-CSF stimulated proliferation; however, the percentage ofblasts decreased in most
cases because of the increased absolute number of granulocytes. In clinical studies,
one-half to three-quarters of the patients exhibited an improvement in white blood cell
count response, but 10 percent to 25 percent of the patients had an increased absolute
number of peripheral blood blasts. To attempt to decrease the risk of leukemic
transformation, some investigators have added low-dose cytarabine during the GM-
CSF infusion. In one randomized study of 48 patients, 27 of 28 patients responded to

IDIOPATHIC NEUTROPENIA/AGRANULOCYTOSIS
Growth factors used in patients with various neutropenias (idiopathic, cyclic, and
congenital) seem responsive to even long-term use ofG-CSF. Patients treated for three
to 15 months continue to respond with significantly increased granulocytes and
resolution of prior infection. (Refer to Table 6.)
SOLID TUMORS
There are a number of studies of GM-CSF with and without chemotherapy.
Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that efficacy correlates with dose and area under the
curve. Subcutaneous administration appears to avoid some toxicities associated with iv
administration. In animal models, both G- and GM-CSF increase speed of recovery
after common cytotoxic drugs. Laboratory studies have suggested that a few fresh solid
tumors and cell lines are moderately stimulated by GM-CSF; however, more are
distinctly inhibited, and most were unaffected. There are now anecdotes of patients
with malignancy-associated leukemoid reactions found to have high serum growth
factor level, presumably of tumor origin.
A number of investigators have delivered GM-CSF alone (with no chemotherapy) in
order to attempt to modulate monocyte function. One sarcoma has partially responded.
Since there have been over 100 patients entered in such studies, the significance of this
response is difficult to assess. (Refer to Table 7.)
Multiple studies of G- and GM-CSF after chemotherapy for specific tumors or
miscellaneous malignancies suggest a decreased duration of neutropenia with either
growth factor. GM- or G-CSF without chemotherapy generally results in a dose-
dependent rise in WBC and granulocytes (to >20,000 WBC in a mean of four days).
The WBC nadir after chemotherapy is generally significantly shallower and shorter
than after historical controls. The total duration of granulocytopenia (polymorphonu-
clear leucocyte [PMN] <500/,ul) is generally significantly shorter. Fever occurs in
about half the patients receiving GM-CSF, and arthralgias, mild headaches, and skin

rash in many patients at doses of 4-32 mg/kg/day. A syndrome of transient hypoxia
and neutropenia immediately after the first dose of GM-CSF results from increased
granulocyte adhesion proteins (CD11b) and congregation of granulocytes in the lungs.
At high doses (e.g., 64 mg/kg/day), however, thromboses around central lines,
pulmonary emboli, and 5-10 kg weight gain associated with pleural and pericardial
effusions (capillary leak syndrome) as well as atrial arrhythmias have been reported.
Morstyn et al. [93] reported a study of a sequence of schedules of G-CSF after 25
mg/mi2 of Melphalan. Occasional bone discomfort was the only side effect. G-CSF
could be started as late as eight after chemotherapy and did not need to be continued
more then seven days [94].

BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION
Myelosuppression is the dose-limiting toxicity for many chemotherapy regimens;
however, for many tumors, optimum response cannot be achieved without exceeding
the dose of chemotherapeutic agents, which causes unacceptable myelosuppression.
The concept ofremoval and storage ofsufficient numbers of hematopoietic stem cells to
re-establish normal marrow function is well established in both animal models and
many human trials. In tumors such as lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease, high-dose
chemotherapy with autologous marrow "rescue" appears to result in prolonged disease-
free survival, compared to treatment with standard chemotherapy regimens for
patients failing standard therapy. The role of autografting in solid tumors is less well
defined at present, but considerable laboratory and clinical evidence suggests that sen-
sitive but incurable tumors are appropriate for investigation ofhigh-dose chemotherapy.
The major morbidity of high-dose chemotherapy results from myelosuppression.
While anemia and thrombocytopenia can be treated by transfusion, no effective
method restores granulocyte and monocyte-macrophage levels. The incidence of
bacterial and fungal infection correlates with both duration and severity of neutrope-
nia. The first polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN) appears on complete blood counts
obtained on day 9 to 11. An absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >500 is achieved at a
median of 18 to 26 days after transplant with platelet transfusion independence at a

median of 21 to 28 days. A median of 30 to 50 inpatient days is required for autologous
bone marrow transplant (ABMT). The psychological effect of prolonged isolation and
hospitalization and hospital costs are substantial. The major cause of the 4-25 percent
mortality for ABMT remains infection or bleeding during the three- to four-week
period of profound myelosupression. More rapid hematologic reconstitution would
substantially reduce mortality, morbidity, and the expense of high-dose therapy.
GM-CSF levels have been found to be elevated between days 7 and 21 after bone
marrow reinfusion, and increased serum levels are also measured in patients with
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Transient cyclic neutropenia has been reported
following the use of GM-CSF after an allograft for chronic granulocytic leukemia
(CGL). (Refer to Table 8.)

AlloBMT: allogenic bone marrow transplant
FRG: Federal Republic ofGermany
Of the nine studies of GM-CSF after bone marrow transplant with historical
controls, there was modest but statistically significantly decreased time to re-
engraftment in eight, with fewer episodes of bacteremia or organ toxicity in the
majority of studies. In the ninth, which used purged marrows, those patients who had
the highest levels of colony-forming units granuloyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) rein-
fused had a markedly shorter time to recovery. Dose correlated with peak WBC.
Platelets are inconsistently affected. Significant shortening of time to >500 PMNs,
>20,000 platelets, and duration of hospitalization are reported in some series. Patient
variability appears considerably related to prior chemotherapy. Toxicity includes
myalgias, transient rash, peripheral edema, minor abdominal cramps, bone pain, and
low-grade fever. At higher doses (-30 ,.tg/kg/day), a capillary leak syndrome with
pleural and pericardial effusions becomes dose-limiting.
There are three studies of GM-CSF used in patients with poor graft function after
autologous or allogeneic bone marrow. One-half to two-thirds of patients are reported
to benefit from GM-CSF. Noteworthy again was the poor response of patients who
received purged marrow.
There are two randomized placebo-controlled trials of GM-CSF after bone marrow
transplant. While the study from Seattle shows no significant difference in duration of
neutropenia, the number of the infectious complications and hospital days were
significantly decreased in the arm receiving GM-CSF. Fewer trials have studied
G-CSF after transplant, but more rapid engraftment in these trials has been reported
as well. One patient received G-CSF for poor graft function. The only randomized trial
reports a significantly shorter period of neutropenia in the group receiving G-CSF but
does not provide the actual days of neutropenia.
Butturini and colleagues in Brazil used GM-CSF in eight patients suffering from
serious radioactive cesium overdose after an abandoned therapeutic radiotherapy
source was inadvertently opened by curious villagers, exposing many in the community
[121].
PERIPHERAL BLOOD PROGENITOR CELLS (PBPC)
Preclinical Studies
There is no clear understanding of why peripheral blood contains progenitor cells or
of the regulation of progenitor cell number. The circulating progenitor cell population
is apparently quite immature compared to marrow cells, is in Go (not in cell cycle), and
does not actively contribute to hematopoiesis. Stem cells collected from the
397
KAREN H. ANTMAN
peripheral blood of laboratory animals by cytapheresis have successfully reconstituted
myelopoiesis following marrow lethal treatment [122,123].
Clinical Studies
Weiner et al. demonstrated that human PBPC could be collected via established
techniques for harvesting platelets [123]. Between five and eight leukophereses are
required for adequate stem cell collection in humans [124,125]. Methods of collection
using density gradient, counterflow centrifugation (surge), or methods to collect
granulocytes and mononuclear cells could influence the duration of aplasia [126].
Initially, studies of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) determined
that their blood contains an order ofmagnitude more granulocyte-macrophage commit-
ted colony-forming units (CFU-GM) than that of normal individuals. Goldman
demonstrated engraftment after delivery of autologous PBPC collected in CML
patients by demonstrating a return to the chronic phase of disease [125].
Juttner et al. (Adelaide, Australia) reported good early engraftment in four AML
patients receiving PBPC collected after induction [124]. Late poor bone marrow
function developed prior to relapse of AML in three, but did not occur in the fourth
patient, who received four times the number of nucleated cells. Engraftment in AML
required significantly more progenitor cells than in non-AML malignancies [127].
Kessinger and colleagues have refined the technical collection of PBPCs and
documented successful engraftment in 34 breast cancer and Hodgkin's disease patients
treated with cyclophosphamide, total body irradiation, and cisplatin [128].
Adequacy and speed of recovery appears related in part to the number of stem cell
dose reinfused [28,29]. Although the actual pluripotent stem cell cannot be measured
in humans, reinfusion of >4 x 105 CFU-GM/kg body weight (15- to 50-fold that
required for ABMT recovery) results in reliable reconstitution. While lower doses yield
less consistent engraftment, variable results may in part result from institutional
differences in colony assay techniques and reagents. The larger number of CFU-GM
required for PBPC compared to ABMT may reflect a lower ratio of pleuripotent to
committed stem cells in peripheral blood or to the few stromal cells transplanted.
Hematopoietic reconstitution using PBPC has been reviewed in leukemia, lymphoma,
and various solid tumors [129,130].
Advantages ofPBPC compared to ABMT: PBPC appear to be a reliable source of
stem cells for reconstitution of myelopoietic function, although the concentration of
hematopoietic progenitor cells in the blood is 10- to 100-fold less than in the bone
marrow. The concentration of true "stem" cells is not measurable in the human
(because of lack of an assay), but it is common practice to measure the number of
progenitor cells committed to myeloid (granulocyte/monocyte) and to erythroid
maturation (measured as CFU-GM and BFU-E, respectively). Preliminary data
suggest that the presence of a neoplasm may increase the number of circulating
CFU-GM [131].
1. Leukapheresis is an outpatient procedure similar to platelet donation. Marrow
donation currently involves hospitalization, general anesthesia, and aspiration of
500-1,000 ml of marrow from pelvic bones.
2. Using the apheresis technique, adequate numbers of stem cells may be
collected from patients with hemipelvectomies, tumor involving the pelvic bones, or
after pelvic irradiation.
398
G-CSF AND GM-CSF IN CLINICAL TRIALS
3. Granulocyte reconstitution may be faster, possibly due to reinfusion of larger
number of committed mononuclear cells.
4. Recovery of immune function appears faster and more complete, possibly due
to increased numbers of reinfused lymphocytes.
5. A consistent feature of PBPC compared with bone marrow transplants has
been rapid granulocyte reconstitution (10-16 days to >500,ul) and equivalent rates of
platelet recovery (19-25 days).
Methods of increasing CFU-GM yields during leukopheresis: Previous efforts to
augment circulating progenitor cell numbers have had limited success. Richman et al.
[132] first observed that nine of 14 patients given cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin
had a significantly increased concentration of peripheral blood CFU-GM at the time of
leukocyte recovery. Initial depletion of the peripheral blood CFU-GM was followed by
a rebound of up to 20-fold (median, four- to sevenfold) the baseline level. This
phenomenon has been confirmed in the majority ofpatients receiving chemotherapy for
lung, ovary, breast, and other solid tumors [133,134,135,136] or following induction
chemotherapy of acute myelogenous leukemia, with leukopheresis yielding 11 ± 2 x
104 CFU-GM/kg/leukopheresis. Other methods have included dextran, steroids, and
endotoxin [129,130]. Nonetheless, between seven and ten leukophereses are required
for adequate stem cell collection; however, -8 leukophereses required per patient
strains blood bank and cryopreservation resources and delays therapy for three weeks.
Thus PBPC reinfusion is not practical as a routine source of stem cells. One interesting
technique currently under investigation is positively to select CD34 cells, using
monoclonal antibody bound to the inner surface of a collecting device [137].
Data from Milan suggest that the combination of both bone marrow and PBPCs
collected via two to three apheresis during rebound from cyclophosphamide results in
significant shorter times to granulocyte recovery >500/gil (a median of eight days in a
small pilot study) in patients with breast cancer or NHL [138,139,140,141].
Effect of GM-CSF on PBPC: Of 12 patients studied during three- to seven-day
continuous infusions of GM-CSF at doses of 4, 8, 16, and 64,g/kg/day [65], Socinski
et al. reported that nine had significantly increased absolute numbers of peripheral
blood CFU-GM (median, 18-fold; range, 2-200; p = 0.01). BFU-E increased a
median of eightfold. In the same patients, they observed a ten- to 100-fold increase in
circulating CFU-GM after treatment with chemotherapy and GM-CSF. Immediately
following chemotherapy, circulating CFU-GM were undectable. CFU-GM recovery
after cycle 1 increased 30-fold (14-fold for BFU-E) compared to recovery after cycle 2
(p = .001). The peak levels of peripheral blood CFU-GM occurred earlier in the cycle
with GM-CSF than in the cycle without GM-CSF (day 16, 16, 16 versus day 19, 22,
27). CFU-GM were increased 9- to 14-fold by the combination of post-chemotherapy
rebound and GM-CSF compared with GM-CSF alone. In the bone marrow, however,
CFU-GM and BFU-E did not change significantly in number [142]. In Japan, Toki et
al. have evaluated G-CSF after cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
prednisone (CHOP) in four lymphoma patients. The number of peripheral blood
progenitor cells increased 37- to 221-fold over baseline and peaked about day 10 [87].
Duhrsen et al. have also shown a similar effect with G-CSF [143]. (Refer to Table 9.)
Augmentation of peripheral blood progenitor cells by GM-CSF may facilitate
collection of adequate numbers of PBPC with fewer leukophereses enhancing the
feasibility of PBPC autografting. If eight to 12 leukapheresis sessions are required to

obtain sufficient progenitor cells, then PBPC autografting is unlikely to replace
marrow harvesting, except in special situations (e.g., known tumor involvement of the
marrow); however, the use of GM-CSF with chemotherapy ± growth factor to
augment progenitor cell number prior to pheresis theoretically could reduce the
number of required phereses (and aliquots frozen) to one to two per patient. If that
method were successful, a shorter duration ofaplasia resulting from the use ofPBPC or
both PBPC and marrow may significantly reduce the mortality, morbidity, and the cost
of high-dose therapy. Multiple groups are now testing the premise that GM-CSF can
enhance collection of peripheral blood progenitor cells [138,140,144,145].
ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS) AND
AIDS-RELATED COMPLEX
A 14-day iv infusion of rhGM-CSF (Sandoz) in 16 patients resulted in a dose-
dependent increase in circulating leukocytes [146]. The peak WBC ranged from 4,575
at the lowest dose, to 48,700/,ul at the highest dose. Increased circulating neutrophils,
eosinophils, and monocytes occurred in all but one patient. In three patients, the
increased circulating WBC observed during iv and three times daily subcutaneous
administration of the same total daily dose was comparable.
Toxicity consisted of flushing during bolus infusions at higher doses, and fever,
myalgia, and phlebitis at the peripheral iv administration site during the continuous
infusion in some patients. Three patients developed a localized, macular skin rash
lasting < 24 hours without relation to dose, duration of treatment, or change in WBC.
Four patients with subclinical disseminated or pulmonary infection (cytomegalovirus,
M. avium complex, Pneumocystis carinii) prior to treatment with rhGM-CSF devel-
oped inflammatory symptoms during treatment. A fifth patient developed fever and
abnormal liver chemistries without any evident infectious agent. Of the five patients
with significant symptoms, three had received 8,ug/kg/day ofglycoprotein, suggesting
that this amount may be the maximum tolerated dose in this patient group when
GM-CSF is administered as a daily 24-hour iv infusion. No dose-limiting local or
systemic toxicity was encountered in three patients who received a second course

MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS
There are a number of observations of the effects of G- or GM-CSF in other disease
states. Urine levels of GM-CSF from patients with bilharziasis are almost twofold
higher than normals [152]. Nimer and associates at the University of California, Los
Angeles, found that serum cholesterol levels declined significantly in eight patients
treated with GM-CSF [ 153].
SUMMARY
In conclusion, growth factors appear likely to enhance the recovery and function of
circulating white cells after standard-dose cancer therapy or high-dose cancer therapy
with marrow transplant and to restore leukocyte numbers and competence in the
acquired immune deficiency syndromes and myelodysplastic syndromes. Phase I and II
trials in patients with AIDS, cancer, myeloproliferative diseases, and after bone
marrow transplant have been published. The results of phase III studies are just
becoming available. A randomized trial of G-CSF in small-cell lung cancer demon-
strates a decreased incidence of febrile neutropenia, antibiotic days, and in-hospital
days [83]. Because of the crossover design of the study, they could not address any
differences in complete response rate or survival. In a randomized trial of GM-CSF in
patients receiving ABMT for lymphoma, there was a significantly shorter duration of
time to re-engraftment (an absolute neutrophil count of >1 00/,Al), number of antibi-
otic days, and time to discharge. Whether the decreased incidence of febrile neutrope-
nia or number ofantibiotic days results from earlier granulocyte recovery or from more
functionally efficient neutrophils is at present impossible to assess.
The use of G- and GM-CSF in myelodysplasia and in leukemias requires caution
prior to the availabilty of data from large randomized trials. Preliminary data from
small randomized trials suggest that the incidence of evolution to leukemia in patients
with myelodysplasia and the number of patients with regrowth of leukemia after
induction treatment in relapsed patients with AML is not significantly different.

402 KAREN H. ANTMAN
Various neutropenias (idiopathic, cyclic, and congenital) seem responsive to growth
factors. Patients treated for three to 15 months continue to respond with significantly
increased granulocytes and resolution of prior infection. The subcutaneous route of
administration is convenient, and patients seem to accept it about as well as diabetics
accept insulin injections.
Because the cost of G- and GM-CSF has not become available, it is difficult to
determine at what level these drugs will be cost-effective. They may be cost-effective in
the setting of intensive therapy such as bone marrow transplantation, where the
reliable recovery ofpatients even a few days earlier would save several thousand dollars
per patient. In standard-dose therapy for regimens where the incidence of hospitaliza-
tion for fever and neutopenia is low, there may be little discernable cost benefit.
Thus, so far the data suggest that growth factors will be a significant addition to the
clinician's armamentarium. In addition, they provide laboratory researchers with new
tools for examining the process of hematopoiesis, clinically and at the molecular level.
