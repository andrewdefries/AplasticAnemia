ABSTRACT
Eltrombopag is a first-in-class, orally bioavailable, small-
molecule, nonpeptide agonist of the thrombopoietin receptor
(TpoR), which is being developed as a treatment for throm-
bocytopenia of various etiologies. In vitro studies have dem-
onstrated that the activity of eltrombopag is dependent on
expression of TpoR, which activates the signaling transduc-
ers and activators of transcription (STAT) and mitogen-
activated protein kinase signal transduction pathways. The
objective of this preclinical study is to determine if eltrom-
bopag interacts selectively with the TpoR to facilitate
megakaryocyte differentiation in platelets. Functional
thrombopoietic activity was demonstrated by the prolifera-
tion and differentiation of primary human CD34؉
bone
marrow cells into CD41؉
megakaryocytes. Measurements in
platelets in several species indicated that eltrombopag spe-
cifically activates only the human and chimpanzee STAT
pathways. The in vivo activity of eltrombopag was demon-
strated by an increase of up to 100% in platelet numbers
when administered orally (10 mg/kg per day for 5 days) to
chimpanzees. In conclusion, eltrombopag interacts selec-
tively with the TpoR without competing with Tpo, leading to
the increased proliferation and differentiation of human
bone marrow progenitor cells into megakaryocytes and in-
creased platelet production. These results suggest that el-
trombopag and Tpo may be able to act additively to increase
platelet production. STEM CELLS 2009;27:424–430

INTRODUCTION
Thrombocytopenia is a condition of an unusually low level of
platelets in the blood and results from an imbalance between the
production and destruction of platelets. Thrombocytopenia is
associated with several medical disorders, including aplastic
anemia [1], myelodysplasia [1], and idiopathic thrombocytope-
nic purpura (ITP) [2]. Clinically significant thrombocytopenia
can occur as a consequence of myelosuppressive or myeloabla-
tive chemotherapy or radiotherapy [3]. Thrombocytopenia can
also be associated with severe chronic liver disease due to the
reduced production of the endogenous thrombopoietic growth
factor, thrombopoietin (Tpo), and/or the increased sequestration
of platelets [4]. In patients infected with the hepatitis C virus
(HCV), thrombocytopenia may occur due to the myelosuppres-
sive effects of the virus on the bone marrow [5].
A key concept in treating thrombocytopenia is to eliminate
the underlying problem, which may include targeting the cause
of the increased platelet destruction (i.e., immunosuppressive
agents or other drugs that may cause thrombocytopenia) or
increasing platelet counts by stimulating the production of
new platelets. Platelet production initially originates from
megakaryocyte precursor cells in the bone marrow. Proliferation
and differentiation in the megakaryocytic pathway is predomi-
nantly controlled by Tpo, a cytokine that is constitutively pro-
duced, and primarily made by the liver [6, 7]. The binding of
Tpo to the thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR) on cells in the
megakaryocyte pathway triggers the activation of the cytoplas-
mic tyrosine kinases Janus kinase (JAK)2 and tyrosine kinase 2,
which in turn activate signal transducers and activators of tran-
scription five (STAT)5, phosphoinositide-3 kinase, and Ras-
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) [8–10]. The subse-
quent changes in gene expression in precursor cells promote

differentiation along the megakaryocytic lineage and have an
antiapoptotic effect, which ultimately leads to platelet develop-
ment and release.
Following the purification of Tpo in the mid-1990s, recom-
binant human Tpo (rhTpo) and a similar protein, megakaryocyte
growth and development factor, were extensively tested for their
ability to overcome thrombocytopenia, and were shown to sig-
nificantly increase circulating platelet levels in mice, primates,
and humans [7, 11–15]. However, because of the induction of
immunogenicity [7, 16], megakaryocyte growth and develop-
ment factor is no longer being tested in clinical trials. Nonpep-
tide, small-molecule TpoR agonists are an attractive alternative
to protein therapeutics because they are more likely to be orally
bioavailable and less likely to be immunogenic.
In this report, we present preclinical results for eltrombopag
(SB-497115, Promacta௡/Revolade™; GlaxoSmithKline, Re-
search Triangle Park, NC, http://www.gsk.com, and Ligand
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Diego, CA, http://www.ligand.com),
an orally bioavailable, small-molecule, nonpeptide TpoR ago-
nist. We show that eltrombopag interacts specifically with the
TpoR without competing with Tpo, thereby activating intracel-
lular signal transduction pathways additively with endogenous
Tpo, leading to the increased proliferation and differentiation of
human bone marrow progenitor cells into megakaryocytes, and
ultimately, increased platelet production.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cytokines and Cell Lines
rhTpo, recombinant human stem cell factor (rhSCF), and recombi-
nant murine interleukin-3 (rmIL-3) were obtained from R&D Sys-
tems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN, http://www.rndsystems.com). Re-
combinant human erythropoietin and G-CSF were obtained from
Amgen, Inc. (Thousand Oaks, CA, http://www.amgen.com). The
BAF3/hTpoR and 32D-mpl cell lines were made by stable trans-
fection of rhTpoR (c-mpl) and STAT-inducible reporter interferon
regulatory factor one (IRF-1; BAF3/hTpoR cells) or the megakaryo-
cyte-specific promoter glycoprotein (gp)IIb (32D-mpl cells) cou-
pled to the luciferase reporter gene, as previously described [17].
These two TpoR-transfected cell lines are dependent on rmIL-3 or
rhTpo for growth. The N2C-Tpo cell line, derived by culture of a
megakaryoblastic cell line in rhTpo for 10 weeks, was generously
provided by Dr. Camille Abboud of the University of Rochester
Medical Center (Rochester, NY).
Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay
BAF3/hTpoR or 32D-mpl cells were washed and starved of rmIL-3
or rhTpo overnight prior to treatment. Starved parental BAF3 cells
(1 ϫ 105
cells/ml) in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium
(IMDM)/0.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 30 ␮M ZnCl2 were
treated with eltrombopag (0.002–50 ␮M) or rhTpo (100 ng/ml) at
37°C, 5% CO2, for 4 hours. Cells were lysed in 100 ␮l lysis buffer
(25 mM tris, 15% glycerol, 2% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethyl-
ammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid, 1% lecithin, 1% bovine serum
albumin, 4 mM EGTA, 8 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.4
mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.8) for 15 minutes and
added to a 96-well plate (30 ␮l per well). Promega Steady Glow
(100 ␮l; Madison, WI, http://www.promega.com) was added to
each well immediately before the plates were read using a chemi-
luminometer (Model ML1000; Dynatech Laboratories Inc., Chan-
tilly, VA, http://dynatechlaboratories.com). Luciferase assay data
are presented as the mean and standard error of quadruplicate wells.
Proliferation Assays
Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) proliferation assays were conducted
using cytokine-starved BAF3/hTpoR cells plated in 96-well plates
at 4 ϫ 104
cells/well. rhTpo (100 ng/ml) or eltrombopag (0.0001–10
␮M) was added to triplicate wells and the cells were incubated in
5% CO2 at 37°C. BAF3/hTpoR cells were grown for 44 hours,
labeled with BrdU, and returned to the incubator for four more
hours. The plates were developed using a BrdU cell proliferation kit
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, http://www.roche-diagnostics.
us) and were read on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate
reader at 380 nm.
Thymidine incorporation assays were conducted using cyto-
kine-starved N2C-Tpo cells plated in 96-well plates (1.4 ϫ 105
cells/ml final concentration), grown in a white view plate, and
exposed to eltrombopag (0.003–3 ␮M) and/or rhTpo (1–100
ng/ml) for 72 hours at 37°C. Tritiated thymidine (1 ␮Ci/well)
was added for the final 4 hours of incubation. Cells were har-
vested onto glass fiber filter mats and read on a Wallac 1,450
Microbeta scintillation counter (PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham,
MA, http://www.perkinelmer.com).
Caspase-3 and Caspase-7 Assays
The Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) is a luminescent assay that
measures caspase-3 and caspase-7 activity. The addition of the
Caspase-Glo reagent results in cell lysis, followed by caspase cleav-
age of the substrate and generation of a luminescent signal; the
amount of luminescence is proportional to the amount of caspase
present. Cytokine-starved N2C-Tpo cells (1.4 ϫ 105
cells/ml final
concentration) were grown in a white view plate and exposed to
eltrombopag (0.003–3 ␮M) and/or rhTpo (1–100 ng/ml) for 72
hours at 37°C. Caspase-Glo (100 ␮l) was added, and cells were
incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature. Luminescence was
measured using the Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer, Inc.).
Western Blot Analysis of STAT5 and MAPK
N2C-Tpo cells (1 ϫ 106
) were starved of rhTpo overnight in
IMDM-containing glutamine and 0.5% FBS. Cells were treated for
up to 120 minutes with eltrombopag (30 ␮M) or rhTpo (75 ng/ml),
pelleted by centrifugation, and placed on dry ice. Lysates were
prepared, proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis, and im-
munoblotting was performed with antibodies to phospho-STAT5
and p44/42 MAPK, as described previously [17].
CD34ϩ
cells (5 ϫ 105
cells/ml) were cultured in StemSpan
(Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada, http://www.stemcell.
com) and rhTpo (100 ng/ml). After 10 days, CD41ϩ
megakaryo-
cytes comprised 75% of the cells. These cells were washed and
starved of rhTpo for 6 hours, treated with rhTpo (100 ng/ml) or
eltrombopag (0, 1, 3 or 10 ␮M) for 30 minutes, and made into
lysates. Lysates were applied to a 12% Tris-Bis gel (50 ␮g per lane),
and anti-phopsho-STAT5 antibody (cat#AB3800; Millipore, Bil-
lerica, MA, http://www.millipore.com) was used to detect activation
of STAT5.
Human Marrow Differentiation Assay
Human blood and bone marrow samples were obtained from
healthy donors with informed consent under an institutional review
board-approved protocol. CD34ϩ
cells were purified from the light
density fraction of normal human bone marrow by Miltenyi (Au-
burn, CAhttp://www.miltenyibiotec.com) immunomagnetic bead
separation as previously described [17]. CD34ϩ
cells were plated at
1 ϫ 105
cells/ml in IMDM with 20% FBS and 100 ng/ml rhSCF.
Eltrombopag (0.003–3.0 ␮M) or rhTpo (100 ng/ml) was added at
10% final volume and the cells were incubated for 10 days at 37°C
in 5% CO2 and 5% O2. Cells were stained with fluorescein isothio-
cyanate-conjugated anti-CD41a (gpIIb), isotype control antibody, or
phosphate-buffered saline as an autofluorescence control. Flow
cytometric analysis was performed on a Becton-Dickinson FACS-
can (BD Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA, http://www.
bdbiosciences.com). Gates for CD41ϩ
cells were based on the
negative control (i.e., SCF-treated cultures). Data are represented as
a percentage of Tpomax (Tpomax ϭ [% CD41sample Ϫ % CD41SCF]/
[% CD41Tpo Ϫ % CD41SCF]).
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay
Human, chimpanzee, cynomolgus, and murine blood samples were
obtained using the appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee-approved protocols. Platelets were incubated with el-

trombopag (0.3–30 ␮M) or rhTpo (100 ng/ml) for 20 minutes at
37°C. Lysates and the IRF-1 DNA probe were prepared as previ-
ously described [17]. 32
P-IRF-1 was incubated with the platelet
lysate at room temperature for 20 minutes and loaded onto a 5%
acrylamide gel. Results were analyzed after visualization by auto-
radiography.
Chimpanzee Study Protocol
Chimpanzee data were collected under an Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee-approved protocol at the Southwest Foundation
for Biomedical Research (San Antonio, TX, http://www.sfbr.org).
Female chimpanzees (approximately 7–8 years of age) were given
either eltrombopag (10 mg/kg) in aqueous 2% hydroxypropyl meth-
ylcellulose with 0.2% sodium lauryl sulfate vehicle or vehicle alone
by oral gavage at a dose volume of 1 ml/kg. Chimpanzees were
given five daily doses of vehicle alone (n ϭ 2) or eltrombopag (n ϭ
3). Platelet counts and reticulated platelet counts were performed
prior to, during, and following the treatment regimen. At the end of
the study, all chimpanzees were returned to the stock colony.
RESULTS
Eltrombopag Molecular Structure and
Characterization
Eltrombopag is a member of the biarylhydrazone class of com-
pounds, with an empirical formula of C25H22N4O4 and a mo-
lecular weight of approximately 442 D (Fig. 1). Eltrombopag
demonstrated a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of
0.27 ␮M in murine BAF3 cells transfected with the luciferase
reporter gene under direction of the STAT-activated IRF-1
promoter and human TpoR (BAF3/IRF-1/hTpoR) (Fig. 2A).
Because eltrombopag is specific to the human and chimpanzee
TpoR, the parental murine BAF3 cell line, which was not
transfected with hTpoR (BAF3/IRF-1), was not activated by
eltrombopag (Fig. 2A). Eltrombopag and rhTpo both demon-
strated activity in hTpoR-transfected 32D-mpl cells using the
reporter assay with luciferase under the direction of the
megakaryocyte-specific promoter gpIIb (Fig. 2B).
Specificity of Eltrombopag Binding
To determine whether the effect of eltrombopag was specific for
the activation of the TpoR, cell lines that are dependent on other
cytokines for growth were tested. In a variety of different
assays, eltrombopag showed no activity in cells expressing
receptors for hematopoietic growth factors that are activated by
STAT, including Epo, G-CSF, interferon (IFN)-␣, IFN-␥, and
IL-3 (Table 1).
The pharmacophore defined by the biarylhydrazone class of
compounds [18–20] has a distinct species specificity. In elec-
trophoretic mobility shift assays measuring STAT activation
induced by such compounds, including eltrombopag, activation
was detected only in human or chimpanzee platelets (Fig. 3A).
A single amino acid difference in the transmembrane domain
(histidine 499 of human TpoR) [21] is hypothesized to be
responsible for this species specificity. Studies of the mecha-
nism of action of eltrombopag and compounds bearing a similar
pharmacophore suggest that eltrombopag activates the receptor
by association with metal ions (i.e., Zn2ϩ
) and specific amino
acids within the transmembrane and juxtamembrane domains of
the TpoR [17, 22, 23].
Activation of TpoR Signaling Pathways
As measured by Western blotting, the activation of the TpoR via
interaction with eltrombopag results in the induction of intra-
cellular signaling pathways similar to those induced by rhTpo,
but with less intensity. N2C-Tpo cells are a Tpo-dependent

426 Preclinical Activity of Eltrombopag
human cell line that endogenously expresses the TpoR. Incuba-
tion of N2C-Tpo cells with eltrombopag at a 30-␮M concentra-
tion resulted in activation of STAT5, as detected with an an-
tiphospho-STAT5 antibody on Western blots. Maximum signal
intensity was observed at 60 minutes after treatment with el-
trombopag (Fig. 3B). The time course of activation by eltrom-
bopag was similar to that achieved by 75 ng/ml rhTpo. Eltrom-
bopag (10 ␮M) also activated p42/44 MAPK with similar
kinetics to rhTpo (50 ng/ml) (Fig. 3C). The detection of STAT5
phosphorylation at 30 minutes after treatment of megakaryo-
cytes derived from CD34ϩ
cells with rhTpo or eltrombopag
demonstrated a detectable activation of STAT5 by rhTpo. As in
the N2C-Tpo cells, the activation of STAT5 by eltrombopag in
these megakaryocytes was dose-dependent, but at a much lower
level than the signal induced by rhTpo (Fig. 3D).
Stimulation of Proliferation and Differentiation in
Mammalian Cells and Cell Lines
In a BrdU assay conducted in BAF3/hTpoR cells, eltrombopag
stimulated proliferation after a 2-day incubation with an EC50 of
0.03 ␮M (Fig. 4A).
In addition to a proliferative effect on cells of the
megakaryocytic lineage, eltrombopag also induces differentia-
tion of hematopoietic stem cells into committed megakaryocyte
progenitor cells. Assessment of megakaryocyte maturation can
be determined by measuring the appearance of the megakaryo-
cyte-specific marker glycoprotein CD41 on human CD34ϩ
cells
obtained from human bone marrow samples. The data were
calculated as a percentage of the maximal number of cells
responding to the maximally efficacious dose of rhTpo (i.e., 100
ng/ml). Eltrombopag increased the differentiation of bone mar-
row CD34ϩ
cells into CD41ϩ
megakaryocytes in a dose-depen-
dent manner with an EC50 of 0.1 ␮M (Fig. 4B).

Thymidine incorporation assays in N2C-Tpo cells were uti-
lized to determine the effect of treatment with eltrombopag in
combination with rhTpo. The results demonstrate that eltrom-
bopag and Tpo are not antagonistic with each other; rather, there
appears to be an additive effect when eltrombopag is added to
suboptimal amounts of rhTpo (Fig. 5A). The additive effect of
eltrombopag also occurs in the presence of rhTpo at a concen-
tration that causes a plateau in cell proliferation rates (i.e., 100
ng/ml).
Caspase-3 and Caspase-7 Assays in Cells Incubated
with Eltrombopag and rhTpo
In an assay measuring the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7,
treating N2C-Tpo cells with rhTpo at concentrations of 0, 1, and
3 ng/ml, and with eltrombopag at concentrations of 0–0.03 ␮M,
demonstrated comparable caspase activity to untreated cells,
indicating that these concentrations of rhTpo and eltrombopag
were insufficient to prevent apoptosis of N2C-Tpo cells (Fig.
5B). The antiapoptotic effect evidenced by lowered caspase
cleavage activity occurred at concentrations of eltrombopag
Ͼ0.03 ␮M. Increasing concentrations of eltrombopag demon-
strated additional antiapoptotic effects in these cells. Cells in-
cubated with 10, 30, or 100 ng/ml rhTpo also demonstrated
decreased caspase activation and an antiapoptotic effect on these
cells. Thus, both Tpo and eltrombopag are capable of preventing
apoptosis in Tpo-dependent cells and could substitute for each
other at suboptimal levels of each treatment.
Repeat Dose Study in Chimpanzees
Given the distinct species specificity for STAT activation ex-
hibited by eltrombopag in human and chimpanzee platelets, a
5-day, repeat-dose safety and pharmacology study was con-
ducted in five female chimpanzees. Chimpanzees were admin-
istered either vehicle alone (n ϭ 2) or eltrombopag in vehicle
(n ϭ 3; 10 mg/kg per day) by oral gavage. Administration of
eltrombopag was well tolerated following repeat oral doses.
There were no adverse effects on hematology, coagulation, or
clinical chemistry parameters. In chimpanzees treated with el-
trombopag, platelet counts were increased over twofold approx-
imately 1 week after the last dose for one chimpanzee and
approximately 1.5-fold for the other two chimpanzees. Platelet
counts returned to near baseline values approximately 2 weeks
after peak values were reached (Fig. 6).

428 Preclinical Activity of Eltrombopag
codynamic signal of a change in platelet count from baseline for
eltrombopag in the chimpanzees was detected at minimum
concentration (Cmin), Cmax, and area under the curve (AUC)
values of approximately 0.107 ␮g/ml, 0.525 ␮g/ml, and 12.1 ␮g
h/ml, respectively.
DISCUSSION
Eltrombopag represents the first in a class of orally bioavailable,
nonpeptide TpoR agonists. In these preclinical studies, we have
shown that eltrombopag activates TpoR with kinetics similar to
rhTpo. Eltrombopag has high potency in in vitro assays for
activation of the STAT and MAPK signaling pathways, and
proliferation of Tpo-dependent cell lines. In addition, eltrom-
bopag induced the differentiation of bone marrow precursor
cells, the ultimate target cell of patients with thrombocytopenia,
with EC50 values in the range of 30–300 nM. These activities of
eltrombopag were shown to be dependent on the expression of
the TpoR. Cells expressing other growth factor receptors, even
those acting through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, were
not activated by eltrombopag, suggesting that the activation of
JAK/STAT by eltrombopag is due to the specific activation of
the TpoR. In addition, eltrombopag and Tpo do not bind to the
same site on the TpoR, which prevents competitive binding and
allows eltrombopag and Tpo to have additive cell-signaling
effects. Differences in some aspects of the signaling pathway
between eltrombopag and rhTpo (i.e., activation of AKT) have
been detected in platelets [24].
Because eltrombopag is specific for humans and chimpan-
zees, preclinical in vivo assessments of pharmacologic activity
were limited to chimpanzees. Oral administration of 10 mg/kg
of eltrombopag per day to chimpanzees was shown to increase
platelet counts after 5 days of administration, which is similar to
the kinetics of rhTpo. These in vivo data, combined with the
EC50 in vitro differentiation results, provided a rationale for
examining the target effect exposure in healthy subjects in a
phase I clinical study [25]. Oral administration of eltrombopag
leading to a steady-state minimal concentration of Ͼ225 ng/ml
and an AUC of 30 ␮g h/ml was targeted as the minimally
effective pharmacokinetic activity for human studies.
The administration of recombinant Tpo to rodents, primates,
and humans has been shown to significantly increase circulating
platelet levels [11–15, 26, 27]. However, attempts to develop an
rhTpo have been unsuccessful, due in part to the development of
neutralizing antibodies to endogenous Tpo in some patients who
received megakaryocyte growth and development factor [16].
Nonpeptide, small-molecule TpoR agonists like eltrombopag
are less likely to induce immunogenicity and may also be
conveniently administered orally.
The development of targeted TpoR agonists has implica-
tions for improving therapy for patients suffering from diseases
associated with low platelet counts. For example, ITP treatment
has focused on reducing autoimmune-induced platelet destruc-
tion through the use of immunosuppressive or immunomodula-
tory therapies, such as corticosteroids and injectable pooled
immunoglobulin preparations, or even splenectomy. Data have
emerged supporting the role of inadequate platelet production in
ITP, and eltrombopag has been successful in boosting platelet
counts in ITP patients [28]. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists
may also prove to have clinical benefit in other conditions in
which thrombocytopenia can occur, such as myelodysplastic
syndrome [29] and HCV [30]. In addition to evaluating the
clinical benefit of eltrombopag, the effects of eltrombopag and
other TpoR agonists on signaling, proliferation, differentiation,
and receptor internalization, among others, suggest many areas
of future preclinical research opportunity.
CONCLUSION
The Tpo mimetic properties of eltrombopag have been demon-
strated in vitro and in animal studies, and have provided the
foundation for the clinical development of eltrombopag in a
broad range of thrombocytopenia-associated conditions. Be-
cause eltrombopag does not compete with Tpo for binding to the
TpoR, eltrombopag and endogenous Tpo may be able to work
together to activate platelet production. Collectively, these data
suggest that oral eltrombopag has great potential for combating
thrombocytopenia of various etiologies.
