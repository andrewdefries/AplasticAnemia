Background
Central nervous system (CNS) complications after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) have not been well characterized in the pediatric population.
Methods
We retrospectively analyzed data of 202 consecutive children who underwent allogeneic
HSCT (60 from matched related donors, 9 from mismatched related donors, and 133 from
unrelated donors) at Asan Medical Center between 1998 and 2009.
Results
Twenty-seven children (13.5%) developed CNS complications within 6 months after
HSCT. Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-associated neurotoxicity was the most common CNS
complication (n=16), followed by CNS infection (n=2), cerebrovascular events (n=2),
thrombotic microangiopathy-associated events (n=2), metabolic encephalopathy
(n=2), irradiation/chemotherapy injury (n=1), and encephalopathy/myelopathy of un-
known causes (n=2). Univariate analysis showed that a transplant from an alternative
donor and the occurrence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (＞grade 2) were
associated with a significantly increased risk of CNS complications. In the multivariate
analysis, acute GVHD ＞grade 2 was identified as an independent risk factor for early
CNS complications. The 5-year overall survival rate was significantly lower in patients
with CNS complications (52.1% vs. 64.9%, P=0.014), whereas CNI-associated neuro-
toxicity did not affect the survival outcome.
Conclusion
CNS complications are frequent among children undergoing HSCT, contributing to early
death after transplant. More attention should be paid to the development of CNS compli-
cations for recipients of alternative donor transplants and patients with severe acute
GVHD who are at increased risk for CNS complications.

INTRODUCTION
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been
widely performed for various genetic and acquired as well
as malignant and non-malignant diseases. However, highly
intensified conditioning regimens can lead to serious morbid-
ity and mortality such as major organ dysfunction, life-
threatening infections, and bleeding. In allogeneic HSCT,
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) constitutes a major addi-
tional source of transplant-related morbidity and mortality.
Neurological complications are also significant clinical prob-
lems in the posttransplant period in allogeneic HSCT recipients.
Significant neurological events have been variably re-
ported to range from 11% to 59% of HSCT recipients and
to be associated with a mortality rate up to 10% of patients
[1-4]. Cyclosporine (CsA)-related neurotoxicity or metabolic
disturbances have been reported to be one of the most com-
mon neurological complications [2, 3, 5-7], whereas in autop-
sy studies, cerebrovascular disorders were the primary diag-
nosis in the neuropathological examination [8]. Despite the
fact that neurological complications after allogeneic HSCT
Korean J Hematol 2010;45:164-70.
CNS complications after HSCT in children 165
represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality, they
have not been clearly described, especially in the pediatric
population. Furthermore, the risk factors for neurological
complications and the impact of neurological complications
on posttransplant survival have been inconsistently
described.
We evaluated the incidence of significant neurological
complications occurring in the early period after HSCT by
focusing on the central nervous system (CNS) complications.
The main objectives were to describe the various types of
CNS complications, the impact of different risk factors, and
the survival outcomes according to CNS complications in
allogeneic HSCT for children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
1. Patients
This study included 202 consecutive patients who under-
went allogeneic HSCT for malignant and non-malignant
hematologic disorders and inherited disorders at Asan
Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) between June 1997 and August
2009. All patients were younger than 20 years at the time
of transplantation. Data on demographics, underlying dis-
eases, CNS involvement of the primary disease, CNS irradi-
ation before treatment, transplant-related factors, and clin-
ical course after transplantation were collected retro-
spectively from the transplant database and electronic medi-
cal records of Asan Medical Center.
Histocompatibility of all donor-recipient pairs was de-
termined by serology for human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-
A, -B, and -DRB1. Patients and donors were typed for HLA-A,
-B, and -DRB1 by serological methods between 2000 and
2002 and by high-resolution molecular typing since 2003.
A fully matched sibling was defined as a 6/6 match on all
A, B, and DRB1 loci. Unrelated donors were 6/6-matched,
8/8 allele-matched, or mismatched at a single antigenic or
allelic locus.
2. CNS complications
Data were retrieved on clinically significant CNS compli-
cations occurring within the first 6 months following alloge-
neic HSCT. For the purpose of this study, only toxicities
of grade 3 or 4 according to the Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 were
considered. The following complications were defined as
clinically significant: seizures, altered level of consciousness,
visual disturbances, involuntary movements, motor/sensory
deficits, cranial nerve palsies, and severe headaches. CNS
relapse and CNS events that occurred following relapsed
disease were not included. Non-repetitive seizures associated
with busulfan were also excluded.
The etiology of CNS complications was determined by
clinical history, symptoms, and microbiological, electro-
physiological, and radiological characteristics. CNS compli-
cations were grouped into 6 categories, namely, calcineurin
inhibitor (CNI)-associated neurotoxicity, cerebrovascular
events, metabolic encephalopathy (associated with renal fail-
ure, liver failure, or electrolyte imbalance), CNS infection,
thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)-associated neurological
manifestations, and radiotherapy/chemotherapy toxicity.
CNI-associated neurotoxicity was defined as any acute ence-
phalopathy that could be related to the administration of
CsA or tacrolimus based on the exclusion of other causes.
CNI-associated neurotoxicity was characterized by seizures,
changes in the mental status, involuntary movement, or visu-
al disturbance that might be associated with hypertension.
The identification of CNI-associated neurotoxicity was sup-
ported by the clinical history, electrophysiological, and radio-
logical findings. Trough levels of CsA and tacrolimus at the
onset of CNS complications were also reviewed.
3. Conditioning regimen and GVHD prophylaxis
The conditioning regimen for each patient depended on
the underlying disease, type of donor and graft, and comor-
bidities. Myeloablative regimens consisted of total body irra-
diation (TBI, 6 fractions of 2 Gy each) or busulfan (16 mg/kg);
most patients also received cyclophosphamide (120-200
mg/kg). If busulfan was administered, prophylactic pheny-
toin (5 mg/kg/day) was administered in children older than
10 years. Reduced-intensity regimens were based on fludar-
abine (150 mg/m2
) in variable combinations with busulfan
(8 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg), low-dose TBI
(2 Gy), or antithymocyte globulin (ATG).
GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CsA combined with one
of the followings: methotrexate, corticosteroid, or mycophe-
nolate mofetil (MMF). The target serum concentration of
CsA was 150-300 ng/mL. Tacrolimus was used for the patients
with GVHD who were unsuccessfully controlled with CsA.
The target serum concentration for tacrolimus was between
5-15 ng/mL. Acute GVHD was graded according to the stand-
ard criteria [9]. Patients were considered evaluable for acute
GVHD, if they survived after engraftment.
4. Statistical analysis
The cumulative probability of developing CNS complica-
tions within 6 months after transplant was determined using
the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis was per-
formed to determine the significant risk factors for develop-
ing CNS complications. When the number of events was
not large enough, the Fisher’s exact test was used for catego-
rical variables. Cox proportional hazard model was used on
multivariate analysis to determine the impact of the various
independent risk factors. P-values less than 0.05 were consid-
ered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were per-
formed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Science,
version 15.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad
Prism (version 5.01, GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA,
USA).

RESULTS
1. Patient characteristics
The clinical characteristics of the 202 patients (128 men,
74 women) are summarized in Table 1. The median age
at transplant was 7.1 years (range, 0.6-18.4 years). Sixty
patients (29.7%) received HSCT from matched related donors
(MRDs), 9 (4.5%) from mismatched related donors, which
included 4 haploidentical mothers, and 133 (65.8%) from
unrelated donors. Stem cell sources were bone marrow (BM)
in 122 patients (60.4%), peripheral blood (PB) after mobi-
lization with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in 52
(25.7%), and cord blood stem cells in 28 (13.4%). The median
follow-up after transplant was 60 months (range, 7-154
months).
2. CNS complications
CNS events occurred in 27 children at a median of 31
days after transplantation (range, 0-155 days) (13.5%, [95%
confidence interval [CI]: 5.2-25.6]) (Fig. 1). Neurological
symptoms included seizures in 15 patients (56%), altered
level of consciousness in 12 (44%), severe headache in 6
(22%), motor weakness in 2 (7%), paresthesia and sensory
deficit in 1 (4%), tremor in 1 (4%), and visual disturbance
in 1 (4%). The etiologies of CNS events were CNI-associated
neurotoxicity in 16 children (59%), cerebrovascular events
in 2 (7%), CNS infection in 2 (7%), TMA-associated neuro-
logical manifestations in 2 (7%), metabolic encephalopathy
in 2 (7%), irradiation/chemotherapy toxicity in 1 (4%), ence-
phalopathy of unknown cause in 1 (4%), and myelopathy
of unknown cause in 1 (4%) (Table 2).

The incidence of CNS complications in the alternative
donor group (including mismatched/haploidentical related
and unrelated donors) was significantly higher than that
in the MRD group (18.5% vs. 3.4%, P=0.007) (Fig. 1). Of
the 27 patients with CNS complications, 14 (52%) died be-
tween 4 days and 72 months (median, 4.7 months) after
HSCT, and at a median of 35 days (range, 4 days-71 months)
following CNS complications. The death of 4 patients was
considered a direct result of CNS complications: cere-
brovascular events in 2 patients and CNS infection in 2.
The remaining 10 patients died of other transplant-related
causes: sepsis in 6, veno-occlusive disease in 1, acute GVHD
in 1, pulmonary hemorrhage in 1, and sudden asphyxia in
1. Mortality due to CNS complications represented 5.4%
of all deaths following HSCT. The 5-year overall survival
(OS) rate was significantly lower in patients who developed
CNS complications within 6 months of transplant (52.1%
vs. 64.9%, P=0.014). With regard to CNI-associated neuro-
toxicity, however, the 5-year OS rate was not significantly
different between the groups of patients with and without
CNI-associated neurotoxicity (74.0% vs. 62.1%, P=0.79) (Fig.
2).
3. CNI-associated neurotoxicity
Of the 16 patients with CNI-associated neurotoxicity, 15
patients were alternative donor HSCT recipients (14 un-
related and 1 haploidentical), and 1 patient received the
transplant from a MRD. The incidence of CNI-associated
neurotoxicity in the unrelated donor HSCT recipients was
significantly higher than that in the MRD HSCT recipients
(10.5% vs. 1.7%, P=0.007). CsA was a potential etiologic
agent in 12 patients and tacrolimus in 4. Twelve out of
16 patients (75.0%) had acute GVHD and, of note, 10 of
them were among the 29 patients who had acute GVHD

higher than grade 2, and 2 were among the 56 with GVHD
grade 1 or 2 (P＜0.001).
Neurological symptoms of CNI toxicity were accompanied
with hypertension at the time of CNS events in 12 patients
(75%). Corticosteroid therapy was used in combination with
CNI at the time of CNS events in 13 patients (81%). Neuro-
imaging was performed in all patients (9 with computed
tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
4 with CT only, and 3 with MRI only). MRI revealed typical
white-matter lesions with occipital predominance consistent
with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
in 4 patients, focal cortical/subcortical lesions without topical
preponderance in 6, signal abnormalities in the prechiasmatic
optic nerve in 1, which suggested optic neuropathy, and
nonspecific atrophic changes in 1. The CT scans were not
informative enough because focal abnormalities that corre-
lated with the MRI findings were only seen in 3 of 13
patients examined by CT, and 5 CT scans did not reveal
abnormalities that were detected by MRI.
When symptoms appeared, CsA and tacrolimus levels were
within the target range in 10 patients and beyond it in
6. In addition to supportive care, the initial management
of CNI-associated neurotoxicity consisted of the change in
medication (n=7), dose reduction (n=7), discontinuation for
a short period and resumption at a lower dose (n=1), and
discontinuation (n=1). None of these patients died of a direct
consequence of CNI-associated neurotoxicity. Of the 11 pa-
tients whose neuroimaging showed focal abnormalities, 7
patients recovered leaving no neurological sequelae with
complete resolution of the focal lesions on MRI, 2 developed
intractable seizures even after their MRI abnormalities were
resolved, and the remaining 2 died of other transplant-related
causes. Of the 5 patients who did not have proven abnormal-
ities on neuroimaging, 2 patients developed Lennox-Gastaut
syndrome (1 patient showed bilateral hippocampal atrophy
on MRI performed 6.7 years after HSCT, and the other had
complications due to hypoxic brain injury after resuscitation
from hemorrhagic shock), while the remaining 3 died of
other transplant-related causes.
4. Risk factors
The analysis of the risk factors for developing early CNS
complications included gender, age at HSCT, diagnosis, CNS
involvement, CNS radiotherapy, type of donor and stem
cell source, intensity of the conditioning regimen, treatment
with TBI, fludarabine, busulfan, or ATG, GVHD prophylaxis,
and occurrence and severity of acute GVHD (Table 1). In
the univariate analysis, the type of donor for HSCT (matched
related vs. mismatched related or unrelated, P=0.01) and
the occurrence of acute GVHD (P＜0.001) were associated
with an increased risk of CNS complications within 6 months
after transplantation. The stem cell source tended to be asso-
ciated with an increased risk of CNS complications with
borderline significance (P=0.06). When factors with a P＜0.2
were evaluated in the multivariate analysis, grade 3 or 4
of acute GVHD was shown to be an independent prognostic
factor for the risk of early CNS complications (odds ratio
[OR]=11.96, [95% CI: 3.96-36.11], P＜0.001) (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
The cumulative incidence of CNS complications within
6 months after HSCT was 13.5% and the mortality rate
as a direct result of CNS complications was 5.4% of all deaths
following HSCT. This result indicates that CNS complications
represent a significant clinical problem among children un-
dergoing allogeneic HSCT. The significant risk factors for
early CNS complications were alternative (mainly unrelated)
donor transplant, and acute GVHD higher than grade 2.
Cord blood as a stem cell source was a risk factor with
borderline significance.
Our study focused on clinically significant neurological
problems, which required immediate diagnostic effort and
treatment. Because of the possible limitations of retrospective
studies, it is likely that less severe and other functional prob-
lems might be underestimated. In fact, a prospective study
that evaluated neurological, neuropsychological, and neuro-
radiological abnormalities, including clinically less sig-
nificant problems, reported that 47% of the patients devel-
oped new neurological abnormalities after allogeneic HSCT
[10]. Our observation of 13.5% incidence is comparable to
other large studies, which reported an incidence of significant
neurological complications between 9.7% and 15.8% in pe-
diatric HSCT [1, 3, 4]. In contrast to observational studies,
an autopsy study revealed that neuropathological findings
were detected in 90% of autopsies performed in bone marrow
transplant (BMT) patients, which suggests that most patients
with life-threatening illness will experience neurological
events [8].
Allogeneic transplants (in studies including both autolo-
gous and allogeneic transplantation), acute GVHD ＞ grade
2, and unrelated donor transplant have been identified as
significant risk factors for neurological complications in most
of the previous studies. The use of TBI [3, 5], female gender
[5], electrolyte imbalance [11], pretransplant viral status [11],
and diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [4] or chronic
myelogenous leukemia [12] have been inconsistently de-
scribed as possible risk factors by various authors. We found
that alternative (mainly unrelated) donor transplants and
grade 3-4 acute GVHD were significant risk factors related

CNS complications after HSCT in children 169
to CNS complications in allogeneic HSCT recipients, which
confirms the observations made in other studies. Multivariate
analysis showed that severe acute GHVD was an independent
risk factor for the occurrence of CNS complications. In pa-
tients undergoing allogeneic transplantation, the use of im-
munosuppressive agents, such as CsA and tacrolimus, is an
essential component in the control of GVHD. Patients who
experience severe acute GVHD are predisposed to CNI-asso-
ciated neurotoxicity because they are usually managed with
aggressive immunosuppression therapy. In addition, cortico-
steroids used during the treatment of GVHD may contribute
to the development of neurological events [13]. Moreover,
it has been reported that patients with severe GVHD tend
to experience not only CNS complications associated with
immunosuppressive drugs but also CNS infections or
TMA-associated neurological events due to immunosu-
ppression [1, 14].
Alternative donor transplantation, especially unrelated do-
nor transplantation, could have an impact on the develop-
ment of CNS complications due to its association with a
high incidence of GVHD. Although the graft source has
been inconsistently reported as a risk factor for the develop-
ment of CNS complications [4], our study showed that cord
blood as a graft source was a significant risk factor for CNS
complications compared to a BM stem cell graft (25% vs.
9.8%). Cord blood recipients are more susceptible to in-
fectious complications and likely to be exposed to the risk
of hemorrhagic complications due to delayed engraftment.
CNI- or CsA-associated neurotoxicity has been con-
sistently reported as the most frequent cause of neurological
complications after transplantation in previous studies [2-5].
In our study, CNI-associated neurotoxicity was the most
common neurological event with an incidence of 7.9% and
10.5% among all enrolled patients and among 133 unrelated
donor transplant recipients, respectively. Patients with
CNI-associated neurotoxicity may have variable white-mat-
ter lesions with or without cortical involvement on MRI
[15]. The previous studies reported that the incidence of
PRES ranged between 5.9% and 7.2% in allogeneic HSCT
patients receiving CNIs, which seems higher than our ob-
servation [5, 16, 17]. These results imply that more thorough
neuroradiological evaluations could more effectively detect
events of PRES. Although marked abnormalities can be de-
tected by CT, CT has a limited role in the detection of
cerebral parenchymal lesions associated with CNI neuro-
toxicity. Thus, MRI should be performed early in the diag-
nostic evaluation of patients on CNIs who develop significant
CNS events. In particular, 1 patient in our series developed
optic neuropathy associated with CsA, which has been rarely
reported as a neurotoxic side effect of CsA [18, 19]. Thus,
optic side effects as well as PRES should be ruled out when
patients during CsA therapy develop visual disturbance after
HSCT.
Patients who develop seizures or encephalopathic features
tend to have elevated blood pressure (BP) at the time of
the CNS events. In this context, CNI-associated neurotoxicity
could encompass patients who were historically thought to
have hypertensive encephalopathy [20]. The serum levels
of CsA or tacrolimus were slightly elevated in only 6 of
16 patients with CNI-related toxicity at the time of CNS
events, and did not increase far above the upper limit in
any patient. It was suggested that genetic differences in the
CsA metabolism might be related to CsA toxicity at the
therapeutic blood levels in a case report [21]. In addition,
the lack of a direct correlation between CsA levels and
CsA-associated neurotoxicity was previously described [15,
22]. These findings emphasize that therapeutic drug monitor-
ing cannot predict all adverse events associated with CNIs.
Thus, recognition of prodromal signs such as tremulousness
or headache, meticulous control of the BP, and correction
of the electrolyte imbalance are important for the early de-
tection and prevention of CNI-associated toxicity.
CNI-associated toxicity is known to be reversible after
withdrawal of the drug [23]. However, irreversible cases
have been reported in a few instances [24]. It is important
to note that 4 patients developed intractable seizures later
during the long-term follow-up despite the resolution of
focal white-matter lesions in 2 patients and the absence
of documented lesion at initial presentation in the other
2. This result suggests that long-term results of CNI-asso-
ciated toxicity may not always be reversible, regardless of
the resolution of the initial lesions on neuroimaging. In par-
ticular, 1 patient showed bilateral hippocampal atrophy on
the follow-up MRI. Faraci et al. also reported 3 patients
who developed intractable seizures with mesial temporal
sclerosis on MRI after CsA-associated neurotoxicity [3]. This
late complication might be associated with an unrecognized
acute lesion on the hippocampus, since acute hippocampal
lesions documented on MRI were reported as CNI-mediated
neurotoxicity [25].
Our data demonstrated a significantly reduced survival
rate for patients with CNS complications. However, when
the comparison was done between patients with and without
CNI-associated toxicity, significant differences in the OS
were not observed. These findings suggest that CNS compli-
cations, excluding fatal complications, such as cerebrova-
scular event and CNS infection, are not associated with
long-term survival. Iguchi et al. also reported that significant
differences in the long-term survival were not observed be-
tween children with and without neurologic complications,
whereas adverse neurological events contributed to early
death [1]. In contrast, Siegal et al. reported significantly
reduced survival in patients with CNS complications as well
as in those with PRES in their adult series [5]. GVHD has
been reported to represent the primary cause of death follow-
ing CNI-associated neurotoxicity in the previous adult studies
[5, 17]. However, our report showed that only 1 patient
with CNI-associated toxicity died of a direct consequence
of acute GVHD. The discrepancy between pediatric and adult
studies might reflect differences in the susceptibility to
GVHD between children and adults. Since discontinuation
of CNI administration may cause poor prevention and man-
agement of GVHD resulting in significant mortality due
to GVHD, decisions on the changes in the immunosu-

ppressive agent should be made carefully in order to balance
the control of GVHD and the management of CNI-associated
neurotoxicity.
In conclusion, CNI-associated toxicity was the main cause
of neurotoxicity in children receiving allogeneic HSCT, fol-
lowed by cerebrovascular events, infection, metabolic ence-
phalopathy, and TMA-associated neurological abnormalities.
These results imply that more attention should be paid to
the recognition of the development of CNS complications
for recipients of alternative donor transplants (especially un-
related donor) and patients with severe acute GVHD, who
are at a significantly increased risk of CNS complication.
Immediate and comprehensive diagnostic work-up, espe-
cially neuroimaging, is required to detect neurological events
in any patients presenting with neurological symptoms.
