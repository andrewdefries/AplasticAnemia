Purpose: To compare the effect of oral acetazolamide and topical 2% dorzolamide in prevention
of ocular hypertension after scleral tunnel cataract surgery.
Setting: Ophthalmic department, Sana’a University, Yemen Sana’a from March 2007 to
October 2007.
Methods: This prospective double-blind, randomized study included 150 eyes undergoing
scleral tunnel cataract surgery with hard posterior chamber intraocular implantation. Methylcel-
lulose was used as the viscoelastic in all surgery cases. Patients were assigned to one of three
groups: group 1: topical gentamicin eye drops (control; n = 52); group 2: systemic acetazolamide
250 mg (n = 45); and group 3: topical 2% dorzolamide (n = 53). Acetazolamide patients received
one 250 mg tablet, one hour before surgery, then half a tablet every eight hours. A topical
dorzolamide 2% or gentamicin was applied in one drop one hour before surgery then every eight
hours, for three days postoperatively. Intraocular pressures (IOP) were measured by Goldman
applanation tonometry one hour preoperatively and 16, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively.
Results: At 16 hours, IOP between the three groups increased significantly with a statistically
significant p-value of 0.008, but the mean IOP of acetazolamide patients was less than other
groups. IOP nearly returned to the normal level 24 and 48 hours postoperatively, but this was
not statistically significant (p = 0.452 and 0.138, respectively).
Conclusion: Acetazolamide offers better IOP control than topical dorzolamide 2% in preventing
ocular hypertension after scleral tunnel cataract surgery.
Keywords: cataract surgery, ocular hypertension, viscoelastic, dorzolamide, intraocular pressure
Introduction
A major reason for subsequent day assessment is to detect raised intraocular pressure
(IOP), which complicates almost 8% of all cataract extractions.1
Postoperative IOP
increase is the most frequent short-term complication of cataract surgery.2–4
It has
become a major concern as an increasing number of cataract patients are having surgery
in an outpatient setting and are discharged soon after surgery. Increasing demand for
cataract surgery is resulting in a greater emphasis on high volume day-case procedures,
where postoperative care varies widely from center to center, with little evidence-based
practice. It is common for patients to be routinely assessed on the day after surgery,
necessitating a further hospital visit.5,6
Postoperative assessment on the day of surgery will detect not only a spike of IOP,
but also most early surgically related complications such as wound leak, iris prolapse,
and a dislocated intraocular lens (IOL). Viscoelastic substances are widely used in small
incision cataract surgery with several advantages. It has the maintenance of the anterior

chamber space, protection of the corneal endothelium, and
facilitation of the surgical procedure, especially during
anterior capsulotomy and IOL implantation. It has some
disadvantage of causing an increase in IOP within the first
24 hours after cataract surgery.7–16
However, in small-incision
cataract surgery there are occasional spikes of 30 mmHg or
higher with the use of sodium hyaluronate.17
Chakraborty and
colleagues recommended the routine use of oral acetazol-
amide after phacoemulsification.18
Systemic carbonic anhy-
drase inhibitors (CAIs) are associated with adverse effects
such as acid-base disturbance, hypersensitivity reactions, and
fatal aplastic anemia.11,19–21
We report a prospective double-blind randomized study
where acetazolamide was given in select patients as a prophy-
lactic IOP-lowering treatment after manual sutureless scleral
tunnel cataract surgery with posterior chamber intraocular
lens (PC IOL) implantation.
Patients and methods
This prospective double-blind randomized study comprised
150 eyes from 150 consecutive patients (68 males and
82 females) with unilateral uncomplicated age-related cata-
ract. All patients were scheduled for manual sutureless scleral
tunnel cataract surgery with poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) hard posterior chamber IOL implantation. Exclu-
sion criteria included patients with history of glaucoma or
lens-induced glaucoma and ocular hypertension more than
25 mmHg. Patients presenting with IOP less than 10 mmHg
were excluded. Patients with uveitis, sublaxating or dislo-
cating crystalline lens, or previous ocular surgery or laser
treatment were not involved in this study. Intraoperative
posterior capsule rupture or vitreous loss was eliminated from
the study. All patients with age-related cataract including
hypermature and pseudoexfoliation syndrome with cataract
were included in this study.
The preoperative baseline IOP was measured before using
dilating drops, then Goldmann applanation tonometry one
hour before surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to one
of three groups based on the type of IOP-lowering medica-
tion given at one hour before surgery: group 1: one drop of
gentamicin(controleyes);group2:onetabletofacetazolamide
(Cidamex) 250 mg; group 3: one drop of dorzolamide 2%
(Xola) instead of apraclonidine due to its unavailability in
the Yemen market. The ophthalmic nurse in our study was the
only one to know which group received one of the three types
of medications one hour before surgery immediately after
taking the base IOP. All patients were operated on in the same
fashionbythesameconsultantophthalmologist.Dilatingdrops
(phenylephrine 2.5%, tropicamide 0.5%) were instilled in the
operated eye approximately one to two hours before surgery.
At the time of this study, phacoemulsification was not started
yet and extracapsular cataract surgery with PC IOL was the
standard technique for cataract surgery in our department.
Peribulbar anesthesia of lidocaine hydrochloride
2% was used in all cases. The operated eye was steril-
ized with povidone–iodine 5% solution for two minutes.
After peribulbar anesthesia was administered, a fornix-
based conjunctival flap was done, followed by adequate
electrocautery for homeostasis, and then a 6 to 7 mm scleral
tunnel incision curving away from the limbus “frown “
incision from 11 o’clock to 1 o’clock position was performed
by the same surgeon. Another temporal 2-mm corneal
tunnel paracentesis incision was applied. The viscoelastic
(methylcellulose) substance was injected into the anterior
chamber. This was followed by capsulorrhexis, hydrodissec-
tion, and prolapse of the nucleus into the anterior chamber.
Delivery of the nucleus using irrigating victus was followed
by irrigation aspiration of the cortical materials remnants and
cleaning of the capsular bag using Ringer’s lactate solution.
The anterior chamber and capsular bag was expanded with
the viscoelastic substance and a hard PMMA IOL implanted
in the capsular bag. The viscoelastic substance was aspirated
from the anterior chamber using an irrigation/aspiration (I/A)
cannula. The incision was left sutureless while the conjunc-
tiva was closed by electrocautery. No miotic agent was used
intracamerally for all surgical patients. Capsule rupture did
not occur in all cases. After surgery, the eye was patched after
subconjunctival injection of gentamicin–dexamethasone.
After this, ophthalmic assistance was the administration
of antiglaucoma drugs according to the subdivision of the
patients, control group (gentamicin) eyedrops every eight
hours, the second group received acetazolamide 250 mg half
tablet every eight hours, while the third group received topical
dorzolamide 2% (Xola) eyedrops every eight hours.
After 16 + 2 hours visits, dexamethasone 1% eye drops
were used five times a day, then followed by measuring
the IOP at 16, 24, and 48 hours after surgery. The IOP in
the operated eye was measured by an ophthalmic resident
unaware of the patient's group assignment using a Goldmann
applanation tonometer.
The SPSS program (version 13; SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA) was used to analyze the data of this study. Group
comparisons of mean with standard deviation were associated
with P-value in preoperative and postoperative IOP using a
one-way ANOVA test. The mean IOP involving the standard
deviation changes from preoperatively to 16 hours, and 24 to

48 hours postoperatively were calculated by paired sample
t-test. The preoperative P value was compared to those after
16, 24, and 48 hours in each group by ANOVA tests.
Results
This study includes 150 eyes from 150 patients who had
surgery between March 2007 and October 2007. All patients
were Yemeni in origin. All surgeries were completed by
one consultant ophthalmologist without intraoperative
complications.
Themeanagewasalmostequalinallgroupswithamale-to-
femaleratioof26:26inthecontrolgroup,18:27intheacetazol-
amide group, and 24:29 in the dorzolamide group (Table 1).
Table 2 shows the mean preoperative and postopera-
tive IOP which peaked at 16 hours in all three groups and
returned to nearly preoperative values by 48 hours. The
mean IOP preoperatively was significantly lower in the
dorzolamide group when compared between and within
groups (p = 0.035). Sixteen hours postoperatively, the mean
IOP was significantly lower in the acetazolamide group than
in the control and dorzolamide groups, respectively, while
within groups highly statistically significant (p = 0.008).
At 24 and 48 hours IOP within groups (p = 0.452 and 0.138,
respectively) returned to nearly basal IOP.
The mean difference in IOP changes from preoperatively
to 16 hours, and 24 to 48 hours, postoperatively is shown in
Table 3. The mean difference in IOP was almost equal in all
groups without significant difference. At 24 and 48 hours,
the mean IOP went down in all groups with no significant
difference between groups.
Six (11.4%) control patients had an IOP of  30 mmHg
or higher at 16 hours compared with seven (12.3%) dorzol-
amide patients and only one (2.2%) acetazolamide patient.
All of those patients with a previous diagnosis did not have
glaucoma or ocular hypertension in the operated eye.
Discussion
We found in this study that acetazolamide controls the rising
IOP in the first 48 hours of manual sutureless scleral tunnel
cataract surgery with hard posterior chamber PMMA IOL
implantation. IOP usually starts to rise two to four hours
after surgery and lasts up to 24 hours, when most of the
viscoelastic material has left the anterior chamber through the
outflow channels.19–21
Some studies assessing the frequency
of a clinically significant elevation in IOP after cataract
surgery found IOP to be transiently raised in 2.3% to 8.9%
of cases.19,22
Some causes contributing to elevated IOP after
cataract surgery such as use of viscoelastic material23
and
retained lens matter may also cause uveitis and shooting
of IOP after surgery. Prostaglandin releases after cataract
surgery also play a role in elevated IOP.19–22,24,25
Postoperative
hyphema may occasionally cause an increased IOP by red
blood cell blockage of the trabecular meshwork. Postopera-
tive increase in IOP may be associated with pain, corneal
edema, optic nerve damage, and visual field loss in patients
with pre-existing glaucoma. Various drugs, including the
systemic CAIs, timolol, pilocarpine gel, intracameral acetyl-
choline, and carbachol have been studied as agents to prevent
postoperative IOP spikes.24–31
One of the primary functions of the next-day review visit
is to measure and treat significantly raised IOP. Discharging
patients a few hours after surgery may miss several patient
guidelines. Many patients at risk of significant morbidity
from a persistently raised postoperative IOP may not be
detected otherwise. A lot of studies done in this field so far
have been to detect and treat early shooting of IOP postop-
eratively.
In this study, we found that the IOP peaked after
16 hours postoperatively in the control (p = 0.000) and
dorzolamide groups (p = 0.000), and acetazolamide patients
had a statistically insignificant increase (p = 0.288), while
IOP increased statistically significantly between groups
(p = 0.008). This agrees with earlier studies in patients after
extracapsular surgery in which IOP peaked six to eight
hours postoperatively.32–35
There were a few patients in the
control and dorzolamide groups whose IOP levels reached
up to 40 mmHg during the first 16 hours and returned to
preoperative levels by 48 hours. Conversely, there were two
(3.8%) patients from the dorzolamide group and only one
(1.9%) patient in the control group whose IOP was lower
than 5 mmHg 16 hours postoperatively. Close examination
of these cases revealed deep anterior chambers and no wound
leak. Significantly, the IOP returned to normal after 48 hours
postoperatively and no complications were reported. This
finding may represent suboptimal anterior chamber infla-
tion at the conclusion of surgery36
or ciliary body shutdown
secondary to the peribulbar anesthesia.

Acetazolamide 250 mg one tablet one hour preoperatively
followed by half a tablet 125 mg every eight hours showed
a statistically significant reduction in the IOP spike post-
operatively at 16, 24, and 48 hours. A previous study
reported the preoperative use of topical dorzolamide37
and
a dorzolamide–timolol combination.38
These were effective
in reducing IOP at six and 24 hours. Another study using
acetazolamide 500 mg administered at one hour before
surgery showed significantly reduced IOP at four to six hours
and 24 hours and fewer pressure spikes above 35 mmHg.39
However, another study using the same dose one hour after
surgery found no significant benefit.40

glaucoma since 1954, when Becker41

humor formation. These drugs inhibit carbonic anhydrase,
which is one of the enzymes that regulate aqueous humor
formation. Systemic administration of CAIs is extremely
effective in reducing IOP in most patients but is accompa-
nied by side effects that can range from mild and annoying
to debilitating and life threatening, the latter necessitating
discontinuation of these drugs. On rare occasions, CAIs
may induce irreversible blood dyscrasias, which can be
fatal. The substantial incidence of side effects and the rare
occurrence of fatal complications have led to controversy
regarding the usefulness of and indications for systemi-
cally administered CAIs in the chronic management of
glaucoma.42
CAIs reduce IOP by inhibiting aqueous humor
formation. This has been demonstrated with the use of
indirect measurement techniques43,44
as well as direct fluo-
rophotometric measurement techniques of aqueous humor
flow rates.45–47
Fluorophotometric studies have documented
reductions in aqueous humor flow rates of 21% to 40% in
normal human volunteers and in a few glaucoma patients
after acute oral dosing with 250 to 750 mg acetazolamide.45–47
McCannel and colleagues24
found that acetazolamide reduced
aqueous flow rates by 24% below the nocturnal flow rate
in the eye of a sleeping patient. Timolol does not produce
such reactions.
In conclusion, we found that acetazolamide effectively
reduced the IOP spike, 16 hours and 24 to 48 hours after
scleral tunnel cataract surgery with hard posterior chamber
IOL implantation. The mean IOP significantly increased in
placebo and dorzolamide groups, 16 hours after surgery. IOP
monitoring in the early postoperative period is still neces-
sary after scleral tunnel cataract surgery with viscoelastic
substance. It may be possible therefore to select patients at
greater risk who developed ocular hypertension after cataract
surgery to receive prophylactic IOP-lowering treatment. This
would minimize patient morbidity yielding significant health
economic savings.
