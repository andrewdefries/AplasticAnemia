Parvovirus B19 is the etiologic agent of erythema infectiosum (ﬁfth disease), a fever-rash illness occurring in childhood. We present
a 10 month old child with high grade fever for 10 days, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy,
generalized maculopapular rash, hematemesis and malena. Bone marrow aspiration and liver biopsy were done. EBV serology
and parvovirus PCR were also performed. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed giant pro-erythroblast consistent with
parvovirus infection. PCR showed ampliﬁcation of parvovirus genomic sequences. Present case highlights an atypical presentation
of Parvovirus B19 infection as fever, rash and hepatosplenomegaly.
1. Introduction
Parvovirus B19 is the etiologic agent of erythema infectiosum
(ﬁfth disease), a fever/rash illness occurring in childhood.
In adults it causes varying degree of aplastic anemia usually
in immunocompromised hosts due to organ transplant
or immunodeﬁciency syndromes. Systemic manifestation
of infection includes multisystem involvement and viral
hemophagocytic syndrome.
Hepatitis and encephalitis resulting in hepatosplene-
megaly and seizure may also be caused by parvovirus,
however incidence is very rare [1]. Very few case reports exist
in the literature with a clinical manifestation of fever, rash,
hepatosplenomegaly, and seizure as a result of parvovirus
infection.
Herein we describe a case presenting with fever, rash,
hepatosplenomegaly, and seizure due to parvovirus infec-
tion.
2. Case Report
A 10-month-old child presented with high-grade fever for
10 days followed by three episodes of generalized tonic-
clonic seizure. Subsequently patient developed bilateral
cervical lymphadenopathy, generalized maculopapular rash,
hematemesis, and melena. On examination child was irri-
table with weight 7.5 kg, height 71 cm, head circumference
41 cm, mild pallor, and healed ulcers in oral cavity. Liver
span was 4.5 cm ﬁrm with rounded margin, coarse ecotecture
on USG, and spleen was palpable 4.0 cm below left costal
margin.
With the previous presentation, diﬀerential diagnosis of
postviral hemophagocytosis/inﬁltrative disorders was kept.
On investigation total leukocyte count was high with lym-
phocytosis, and peripheral smear showed activated lympho-
cytes. Fibrinogen was low, ferritin was high, and triglyceride
was raised (Table 1). Bone marrow aspiration and liver
biopsy were done. EBV serology and parvovirus PCR were
also performed. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed
giant proerythroblast consistent with parvovirus infection
(Figures 1 and 2). CSF culture was sterile. PCR showed
ampliﬁcation of parvovirus genome. Upper gastrointestinal
endoscopy was done and was normal. No abnormality was
detected to explain hematemesis. Liver biopsy showed mild
nonspeciﬁc steatohepatitis. Serology for human immunode-
ﬁciency virus was negative.
Patient was managed conservatively with oral antibiotic,
vitamins, and hematinics. Child was afebrile at discharge
with persistent hepatosplenomegaly.

3. Discussion
Acute infection of parvovirus in childhood causes fever rash
illness known as “erythema infectiusum” or “ﬁfth disease”.
Disease is characterized by fever, rash, constitutional symp-
toms and is self-limiting. In immunocompetent adult hosts
virus causes acute symmetric polyarthropathy. In immuno-
compromised adult host chronic infection of parvovirus B19
causes variable degree of erythroid hypoplasia and in severe
form leads to pure red cell aplasia. The pathogenesis may
be due to its tropism and direct cytotoxicity to erythroid
progenitor cells [2].
Nervous system involvement of parvovirus infection is
rare and usually manifest as meningitis, encephalitis, and
very rarely seizure episode [3, 4]. Hepatic involvement is
also very rare and usually seen in cases of coinfection with
other hepatotropic viruses [1]. Simultaneous involvement
of CNS and liver resulting in encephalitis, hepatitis, and
hepatosplenomegaly is exceptionally rare, and very few
case reports are available in the literature [1]. Parvovirus
causes anemia due to selective erythroid tropism resulting
in hypoplasia. Exact pathologic mechanism of erythroid
hypoplasia is not clear; however receptor for virus on
Journal of Tropical Medicine 3
erythroid precursor cells is a likely mechanism. Pathologic
mechanism of meningitis, encephalitis, and hepatitis is also
unclear. This immunocompetent child presented with self
limiting fever, hepatitis, hepatosplenomegaly, and seizure. He
was managed conservatively and was stable at discharge.
4. Conclusion
We present this case of 10-month-old immunocompetent
male child presenting with seizure, fever, rash with a
bone marrow and PCR diagnosis of parvovirus infection
for its extremely rare presentation with encephalitis and
hepatosplenomegaly.
In the light of the present experience, the diagnosis
of parvovirus B19 acute infection should be considered
in any case of acute febrile illness with seizure, rash, and
hepatosplenomegaly.
