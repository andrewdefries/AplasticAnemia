Abstract
Background: Klebsiella oxytoca can cause various infectious complications in healthy as well as in
immunocompromised individuals.
Case Presentations: Case 1: A 49 year old female with multiple myeloma received an autologous
hematopoietic stem cell transplant in October 2005. Eight days following her autograft she
developed septic shock caused by Klebsiella oxytoca bacteremia which was successfully treated
with intravenous meropenem and gentamicin. Case 2: A 29 year old female with sickle cell anemia
and severe aplastic anemia underwent an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant in July 2005.
Seven months following her unsuccessful allograft, she developed septic shock due to Klebsiella
oxytoca bacteremia caused by a urinary tract infection. The septic episode was successfully
managed with intravenous meropenem and gentamicin. Both patients were treated at King Faisal
Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. To our knowledge, they are the
first reports of Klebsiella oxytoca bacteremias and septic shocks in hematopoietic stem cell
transplant recipients.
Conclusion: Klebsiella oxytoca should be considered as a possible cause of severe infections in
recipients of various forms of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, these infections
may be complicated by bacteremias, septic shocks, systemic dysfunctions and even deaths if not
managed promptly and appropriately.
Introduction
Klebsiella species are the second most frequent cause of
gram-negative bacteremia [1]. Since the early 1980s, Kleb-
siella oxytoca (K. oxytoca) isolates have been recognized
as clinically significant [2]. The isolation of this organism
from clinical specimens is an indication for therapy [2].
Extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) production by
K. oxytoca causes bacterial resistance to B-lactam antibiot-
ics and contributes to therapeutic problems [2,3]. The
organism is usually resistant to the oxyimino B-lactams
such as cefotaxime, ceftazidime and the monobactam
aztreonam [2]. In patients with Klebsiella bacterermia,
monotherapy with an antibiotic that is active in-vitro
against Klebsiella eg a beta-lactam or an aminoglycoside

is a sufficient treatment for hemodynamically stable
patients but in severely ill patients having hypotension, an
antibiotic combination therapy with a beta-lactam and an
aminoglycoside is usually preferred [1].
Case presentations
Case 1
A 49 year old Saudi female was diagnosed to have multi-
ple myeloma (MM), IgG kappa, at King Faisal Specialist
Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH&RC) in Riyadh in
April 2005. She presented with: fatigue; bony pains; ane-
mia; hypercalcemia; high total protein, Ig G level, beta-2
microglobulin and erythrocytic sedimentation rate; 40%
plasma cells in the bone marrow and diffuse lytic lesions.
After receiving 4 courses of VAD chemotherapy (vincris-
tine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone), her disease
became under control. In September 2005, she underwent
an autologous peripheral blood stem cell collection in
preparation for an autologous hematopoietic stem cell
transplant (HSCT). On admission to the HSCT unit, the
patient was asymptomatic and her physical examination
did not reveal any abnormality. Investigations showed:
CBC: WBC: 4.4 × 109/L (neutrophilis: 2.64), Hb 92 g/L
and PLT: 419 × 109/L. The renal, hepatic and coagulation
profiles were all within normal limits and a repeat bone
marrow biopsy showed 4% plasma cells. The patient was
conditioned with high dose IV melphalan and she
received acyclovir, fluconazole and trimethoprim-sul-
phamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) as infection prophylaxis.
On 5/10/2005, the patient received her autograft without
any complications. In the early post-HSCT period, she
developed: grade II mucositis treated with IV morphine
infusion and Clostridiun difficile colitis treated with met-
ronidazole. On 13/10/2005; the patient became febrile so
septic screens were taken and she was empirically com-
menced IV piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 grams thrice daily
and IV gentamicin 2 mg/kg twice daily. On 14/10/05, she
started to have high fever and rigors and her BP dropped
to 85/40 mm Hg. However, she had no other complaints
and physical examination did not reveal any focus of
infection. The septic screens were repeated and the IV
tazobactam-piperacillin was replaced by IV meropenem 1
gram thrice daily. Few hours later, the patient started to
improve clinically and her BP became stable. The central
blood cultures taken on 13/10/05 grew K. oxytoca sensi-
tive to augmentin, cefazolin, ceftiaxone, gentamicin and
meropenem. The peripheral blood cultures as well as the
urine, the throat and the stool cultures were negative. As
the patient maintained her hemodynamic stability, she
was continued on meropenem and gentamicin. She
engrafted her leucocytes on day +14 and her platelets on
day + 12 HSCT. After the recovery of her blood counts and
the control of her septic episode, the IV antibiotics were
replaced by oral cefuroxime. On 23/10/2005, the patient
was having no complaints and her repeated physical
examination revealed no abnormality. The blood indices,
the renal and hepatic profiles were normal. She was sent
home on: cefuroxime 500 mg orally twice daily for 4 days
in addition to prophylactic TMP/SMZ, acyclovir and flu-
conazole till day +30 HSCT. Thereafter the patient had
regular follow up at the HSCT outpatient clinic and no
major complication was encountered.
Case 2
A 29 year old Saudi female with clinically mild sickle cell
disease, requiring infrequent blood transfusions and mild
analgesia but no iron chelating agents, was diagnosed to
have severe aplastic anemia (SAA) at KFSH&RC in Riyadh
in late December 2005. She presented with mucosal
bleeding, anemic manifestation, pancytopenia and
severely hypocellular bone marrow without blasts or
abnormal cells. Screens for fanconi anemia and paroxys-
mal nocturnal hemoglobinuria were negative. Hepatitis
serology and viral screens including parvovirus B-19 were
also negative. After failing to respond to a course of anti-
thymocyte globulin, cyclosporine-A and prednisone and
finding a healthy and an HLA-identical sibling donor, the
patient was planned for an allogeneic HSCT. She was con-
ditioned with cyclophosphmide and fludarabine. She
received methotrexate and cyclosporine-A as graft versus
host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis and fluconazole, acy-
clovir and penicillin as infection prophylaxis. She received
her allograft on 11/7/2005. Unfortunately she had no
engraftment so she remained pancytopenic and she was
continued on G-CSF in addition to platelet and packed
red cell transfusions. She was given various antimicrobials
for the repeated infections encountered. On 15/2/2006,
the patient was readmitted with fever, rigors, dysuria, diz-
ziness and fatigue for 2 days. Physical examination
showed: temperature: 39.4°C, BP: 80/40 mmHg and
pulse rate 112/minute. She was looking unwell and pale.
Her chest was clear. There was bilateral loin tenderness
but no palpable abdominal organomegaly. The cardiovas-
cular and neurological examinations were normal. After
taking blood cultures and septic screens, the patient was
commenced on: IV fluids at 150 cc/hour, IV meropenem:
1 gram thrice daily and IV gentamicin 2 mg/kg twice daily
in addition to GCSF and blood product transfusion sup-
port. Few hours later, the patient started to improve; the
pyrexia and the rigors subsided and the BP started to sta-
bilize. Thereafter the patient maintained her hemody-
namic stability. The central and the peripheral blood
cultures as well as the urine cultures taken on 15/2/2006
grew: K. oxytoca sensitive to: augmentin, cefazolin, gen-
tamicin and meropenem but resistant to amoxycillin. On
16/9/2006, the patient was asymptomatic, afebrile, her BP
was normal and her repeated physical assessment showed
no more loin tenderness. Six days after the septic shock,
the IV gentamicin was stopped but the IV meropenem was
continued for a total duration of 2 weeks. Later on, the

patient remained pancytopenic but clinically and hemo-
dynamically stable. On 22/2/2006, the patient received a
booster dose of peripheral blood stem cells from the same
donor, which did not have any positive impact on her
bone marrow function. On 5/3/2006, the patient was dis-
charged on: prophylactic ciprofloxacin, fluconazole and
acyclovir in addition to pentamidine nebulizer 300 mg
once/month. Thereafter, she continued to be pancyto-
penic and to have regular follow up at the HSCT outpa-
tient clinic.
Discussion
Infections caused by K. oxytoca occur in healthy individu-
als, newborn babies and immunocompromised hosts
such as patients with diabetes mellitus, solid tumours and
leukemia [4-13]. These infections may be encountered in
patients having: neurosurgical procedures, prostatecto-
mies, colonoscopies, intravascular catheters, platelet
transfusions, urinary tract infections and pre-existing viral
or antibiotic induced colitis [4-7]. K. oxytoca can cause
systemic infections such as meningitis, adrenal hemor-
rhage, hemorrhagic colitis and septic shock [4-8]. Out-
breaks of K. oxytoca infections have been reported in:
newborn babies following colonization of their digestive
tracts, oncology patients following contamination of
intravenous fluids and in cardiac patients following con-
tamination of invasive blood pressure monitoring devices
[11-13].
Bacteremia caused by K. oxytoca can be nosocomial or
community-acquired [4-6,8-14]. It is usually associated
with polymicrobial bacteremias and occurs in patients
with certain underlying conditions eg hepatobiliary or
pancreatic disorders, neoplastic disorders and diabetes
mellitus [14,15]. The clinical manifestations of K. oxytoca
infections are very variable and may include: biliary tract
infections, primary bacteremias, intravascular device-
associated infections, urinary tract infections, skin and
soft tissue infections and peritonitis [14,15]. These infec-
tions may be complicated by: bacteremia and septic
shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation and death
[5,14,15]. The mortality rates range between 9 and 24%
[14,15]. Poor prognosis and fatal outcomes are associated
with: septic shock, deterioration of mental status, pol-
ymicrobial bacteremias and having certain underlying
conditions such as solid tumours [14,15]. In K. oxytoca
infections, surgical intervention, which may occasionally
be required, has been shown to have a beneficial protec-
tive role [14]. Previous antibiotic therapy is strongly asso-
ciated with resistance to the extended-spectrum
cephalosporins [14]. In patients with K. oxytoca bactere-
mia, 86% of the strains have been found to be susceptible
to cefazolin and almost all the strains have been found to
be susceptible to: ampicillin-sulbactam, aminoglycosides,
cefmetazole, quinolones and carbapenems [15].
ESBLs are extremely broad spectrum B-lactamase enzymes
that are found in a variety of enterobacteriaceae. When
producing these enzymes, the organisms become highly
effective at inactivating various B-lactam antibiotics. The
most common ESBL producing organisms are: E. coli, K.
pneumoniae and K. oxytoca [3]. ESBL producing bacteriae
are frequently resistant to many classes of antibiotics
including aminoglycosides and flouroquinolones thus
resulting in infections that are difficult to treat [2,3]. Pip-
eracillin-tazobactam and cefepime should not be rou-
tinely administered for the treatment of ESBL producers.
However, carbapenems are considered the treatment of
choice for patients infected with ESBL producing patho-
gens [3].
The first patient presented had MM and she received an
autologous HSCT after the control of her disease in an
attempt to cure the myeloma. Despite giving IV gen-
tamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam to control her febrile
neutropenic episode, she developed the septic shock one
day later. There was no clinical focus for the infection
although it coincided with an episode of colitis treated
with metronidazole. Few hours after shifting to IV mero-
penem, her septic shock became under control. The sec-
ond patient had recurrent infections as she remained
pancytopenic following the failure of her allogeneic
HSCT. The urinary tract infection was the cause of her K.
oxytoca bacteremia. As the patient presented to the HSCT
clinic with clinical evidence of septicemia (fever, rigors
and hypotension), she was immediately commenced on
IV meropenem and gentamicin which controlled her sep-
tic shock within few hours. In both patients, the organ-
isms were not ESBL producers and the septic episodes
were successfully managed in the HSCT unit without
resorting to higher levels of care or even inotropic sup-
port.
Conclusion
K. oxytoca can cause serious infections, bacteremias and
septic shocks in immunocompromised individuals
including recipients of various forms of HSCT. Careful
clinical assessment, taking enough investigations and
administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy are
essential not only to control these infections but also to
prevent further complications.
