Benzene is an important industrial chemical
(> 2 billion gallons produced annually in the
United States) and component of gasoline
(Gist and Burg 1997). Its toxic effects on the
blood and bone marrow include leukopenia,
pancytopenia, and aplastic anemia, and it is
also an established cause of human leukemia
(Snyder 2002). However, the mechanisms of
benzene-induced hematotoxicity and leukemo-
genesis remain unclear, as does the risk ben-
zene poses at low levels of exposure (Krewski
et al. 2000). To shed further light on these
mechanisms and better understand the risk
benzene poses, we examined the effects of
benzene exposure on peripheral blood
mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression in
a population of shoe-factory workers with
well-characterized occupational exposures to
benzene using cDNA microarrays and real-
time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Microarrays use immobilized cDNA or
oligonucleotide probes to simultaneously moni-
tor the expression of thousands of genes and
obtain a view of global gene expression (i.e., a
view of all mRNA transcripts expressed by a
cell is known as the transcriptome) (Staudt
2003; Staudt and Brown 2000) and are becom-
ing increasingly used in toxicology (Hamadeh
et al. 2002; Waters et al. 2003). They have also
been used recently to investigate variation in
gene expression in the peripheral blood leuko-
cytes of normal individuals (Whitney et al.
2003). We hypothesized that microarrays could
identify changes in gene expression that could
be used as new biomarkers of exposure and
early effect for benzene and provide informa-
tion on mechanisms of benzene toxicity.
One potential problem with using
microarrays in epidemiologic studies is that
mRNA is unstable (Thach et al. 2003). Most
epidemiologic studies that have collected bio-
logic samples have not collected material that
contains stabilized RNA for analysis. Here, we
have overcome this problem by performing the
ﬁrst step of RNA isolation in the ﬁeld and sta-
bilizing the RNA for later analysis. We have
analyzed this RNA from selected subjects using
a comprehensive and standardized human
array, the U133A/B Affymetrix GeneChip set
(Iacobuzio-Donahue et al. 2003). U133A and
U133B chips together contain almost
45,000 probe sets, representing > 39,000
unique transcripts derived from approximately
33,000 well-substantiated human genes, allow-
ing investigators to obtain a global view of
gene expression.
We performed a proof-of-principle study in
which we examined global gene expression in a
small number of well-matched exposed–control
subject pairs. Genes with differential expression
were then ranked and selected for further exam-
ination using several forms of statistical analysis.
We also speciﬁcally examined the expression
of all cytokine genes on the array under the
a priori hypothesis that these key genes
involved in immune function are likely to be
altered by benzene exposure (Aoyama 1986).
We then attempted to conﬁrm the array ﬁnd-
ings for the leading differentially expressed
genes using real-time PCR, which is thought to
be more accurate than microarray analysis but
can be used only to investigate a few genes at a
time (Etienne et al. 2004). Once these genes
were confirmed in the paired analysis, we
examined their expression in a larger number of
benzene-exposed subjects and controls. The
overall goal is to provide potential gene markers
of exposure and early effect for benzene and to
produce mechanistic insight into how benzene
affects the body, especially the immune system
and lymphocyte function.
Materials and Methods
Study subjects and exposure assessment. We
studied workers exposed to benzene in two
shoe manufacturing factories and unexposed
controls from three clothes manufacturing
factories in the same region of Tianjin,
China. The study was approved by institu-
tional review boards at all institutions.
Participation was voluntary, written informed
consent was obtained, and the participation
rate was approximately 95%.
An initial group of six workers was selected
from among the more highly exposed workers
(mean benzene ± SD = 47.3 ± 24.3 ppm), and
six controls were frequency-matched to these

Benzene is an industrial chemical and component of gasoline that is an established cause of
leukemia. To better understand the risk benzene poses, we examined the effect of benzene expo-
sure on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression in a population of shoe-
factory workers with well-characterized occupational exposures using microarrays and real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PBMC RNA was stabilized in the field and analyzed using a
comprehensive human array, the U133A/B Affymetrix GeneChip set. A matched analysis of six
exposed–control pairs was performed. A combination of robust multiarray analysis and ordering
of genes using paired t-statistics, along with bootstrapping to control for a 5% familywise error
rate, was used to identify differentially expressed genes in a global analysis. This resulted in a set
of 29 known genes being identiﬁed that were highly likely to be differentially expressed. We also
repeated these analyses on a smaller subset of 508 cytokine probe sets and found that the expres-
sion of 19 known cytokine genes was signiﬁcantly different between the exposed and the control
subjects. Six genes were selected for confirmation by real-time PCR, and of these, CXCL16,
ZNF331, JUN, and PF4 were the most signiﬁcantly affected by benzene exposure, a ﬁnding that
was confirmed in a larger data set from 28 subjects. The altered expression was not caused by
changes in the makeup of the PBMC fraction. Thus, microarray analysis along with real-time
PCR conﬁrmation reveals that altered expressions of CXCL16, ZNF331, JUN, and PF4 are poten-
tial biomarkers of benzene exposure. Key words: Affymetrix, benzene, biomarkers, blood, expres-

subjects on the basis of age and sex. Mean age
was 33.7 ± 7.1 years for the six exposed work-
ers and 31 ± 6.7 years for the controls. Four
pairs were male and the other two female.
Before phlebotomy, individual benzene
and toluene exposure was monitored by each
wearing an organic vapor passive monitor
badge as previously described (Vermeulen
et al. 2004). Personal full-shift air monitoring
was conducted about every month over a 3- to
4-month period before biologic sample collec-
tion. Benzene and toluene were not detected
in air samples from the control factories.
Each subject was given a physical exam
by a study physician. A questionnaire was
administered that requested detailed informa-
tion on occupation, environmental exposures
to solvents and pesticides, past and current
tobacco and alcohol use, past and current
medical history including recent infections,
diagnostic and therapeutic ionizing radiation
exposure, medication use, family history, and
a food frequency questionnaire developed for
use in northern China.
Biologic sample collection. Peripheral blood,
buccal cells, and urine were collected from each
subject at the beginning of the workday around
0900 hr and were processed within 6 hr of col-
lection. White blood cell differential counts and
the levels of natural killer (NK) cells, B lympho-
cytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were
determined. The PBMC fraction, consisting of
lymphocytes, monocytes, and some platelets,
was isolated in the field using Ficoll-Paque
(Amersham, Piscataway, NJ). One to five
million PBMCs were added to 1 mL RLT
buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) containing
1% β-mercaptoethanol to preserve RNA in the
cells. RNA that is frozen in this buffer at –80°C
is highly stable.
RNA isolation, amplification, and
hybridization. We isolated total RNA using
RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen) according to manu-
facturer instructions and quantified using a
SmartSpec 3000 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Only samples with an A260/A280 between 1.7
and 2.2 were considered suitable for use.
Samples were prepared according to the
GeneChip Eukaryotic Small Sample Target
Labeling Assay Version II (Affymetrix 2003a),
with the exception that the GeneChip Sample
Cleanup Module (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,
CA) was used and not ethanol precipitation.
Total RNA (100 ng) was amplified for each
sample, with 400 ng of first-round cRNA
used for the second round of cDNA synthe-
sis. Second-round cRNA (15 µg) was frag-
mented in 30 µL of 1× fragmentation buffer.
Hybridization cocktails were made as described
in the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical
Manual (Affymetrix 2003b) and hybridized to
U133A chips at 60 rpm, 45°C. After 16 hr,
the hybridization cocktails were removed,
added back to the unused hybridization cock-
tails, and stored at –80°C. GeneChips were
stained with streptavidin–phycoerythrin using
the EukGE-WS2 protocol (Affymetrix 2003b).
GeneChips were scanned twice using a
GeneChip Scanner GA 2500 (Affymetrix).
Frozen hybridization cocktails were heated to
65°C for 5 min and then applied to U133B
chips as described for U133A chips [of the
45,000 probe sets, only 100 (which can be
used for normalization) are found on both
chips, so this “recycling” of hybridization cock-
tail should not affect the results]. Chips were
then analyzed as described below.
Chip normalization. To allow compari-
son, all chips were scaled to a target intensity
of 500 based on all probe sets on each chip.
Samples were run blind so that exposure sta-
tus was unknown and designated as being
either group A or B. Group A chips were used
as the baselines when analyzing chips from
group B.
Statistical analysis to identify differen-
tially expressed genes. Robust multiarray analy-
sis (RMA) (Irizarry et al. 2003) was used to
analyze the data produced by the chips. Two
RMA analyses of the GeneChip data were per-
formed. First, we performed a global gene
analysis that looked at all genes on both chips
simultaneously. Probe sets for which expres-
sion was significantly different between
exposed and unexposed individuals were iden-
tified using a standard paired t-test, and a
recently developed bootstrapping technique to
provide a critical value adjusted to provide a
5% familywise error rate (FWER), the stan-
dard value used in the literature. The boot-
strapping technique can provide a more
accurate (and less conservative) FWER than
standard methods (e.g., Bonferroni’s adjust-
ment) (Pollard and Van der Laan 2003). As

resampling techniques can be used to directly
model the joint distribution of the null test
statistics so that the dependence of genes is
implicitly factored in when determining error
rates for different cutoffs. The main advantage
of this technique over others such as
Bonferroni’s is that it can provide accurate
control of error rates even when gene expres-
sions on the same chip are statistically depen-
dent (in this case, Bonferroni is often very
conservative). However, the theory developed
for the technique is asymptotic, and its perfor-
mance can be less than optimal with very
small sample sizes (due to random sampling of
matched array pairs with replacement causing
an excessive number of ties in some samples).
RMA (normalization, background correc-
tion, and calculation of expression) was applied
to all genes and all chips simultaneously. We
then performed a targeted analysis of cytokine
genes by applying the multiple testing proce-
dures to this subset after RMA processing was
completed. This was based on the a priori
hypothesis that cytokines involved in the
immune response should be affected by ben-
zene exposure because of its known immuno-
toxicity, and we thus derived more power to
select differentially expressed cytokine genes by
limiting the analysis only to this subset. The
subset of 508 cytokine probe sets represented
on the U133 chips was identified using
NetAffx (http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/
index.affx) and the key word “cytokine.”
Real-time PCR confirmation using
TaqMan. Total RNA (100 ng) was converted
to cDNA using the SuperScript First-Strand
Synthesis System for reverse-transcriptase PCR
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using oligo dT
primers according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. This cDNA was used to conﬁrm
GeneChip findings using TaqMan Gene
Expression Assays (TMGEAs; Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Assays were run
in quadruplicate with 1× TaqMan Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems), 1× assay mix, and 50 ng
of cDNA in each 25-µL reaction for six genes
plus TATA box binding protein (TBP) as an
endogenous control (32 reactions/sample).
Reactions were run on Applied Biosystems ABI
PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System as
follows: 95°C for 10 min, followed by
40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 1 min.
The 12 samples that had been run on chips
were run in exposed–unexposed pairs to reduce
experimental variability. The mean baseline
(TBP) threshold cycle (Ct) was subtracted from
the mean Ct for the other six assays to normal-
ize results. These were then compared between
exposed and unexposed sample pairs. Assays
used were as follows: TBP (endogenous
control), Hs99999910_m1; CXCL16,
Hs00222859_m1; IL4R, Hs00166237_m1;

Results
Differential global gene expression in the
exposed–control matched pairs. PBMC RNA
from six matched pairs of subjects (one
exposed and one age- and sex-matched con-
trol in each pair) was analyzed on Affymetrix
GeneChips. RMA analysis of the data using
paired t-statistics, bootstrapping, and a 5%
FWER indicated that 2,129 probe sets were
significantly different in people exposed to
high levels of benzene compared with
matched unexposed subjects. Expression of
964 of these probe sets was decreased, and
1,165 were increased. Table 1 shows the top
25 up-regulated probe sets identified on the
basis of the lowest p-values, and Table 2
shows the top 25 down-regulated probe sets.
A number of the probe sets identiﬁed in the
top 50 were expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
or coded only for hypothetical proteins.
Twenty-nine probe sets corresponded to
genes coding for known proteins. Of these,
the gene for HSPA1A was the most strongly
down-regulated (–66%) (Table 1), and that
for CREM was the most strongly up-regulated
(+145%) (Table 2). The significance of this
latter finding is unclear because CREM has

very low expression in lymphocytes. Other
genes of note that were up-regulated were
ZNF331, PTPRE, toll-like receptor 2, the
chemokine CXCL16, and CD44 antigen
(Table 1). Note that CD44 and ZNF331 are
present on both A and B chips and so they are
listed twice in Table 1, but both have similar
p-values and expression ratios on the A and
B chips, providing a good quality control
check. Other genes of interest that were sig-
nificantly down-regulated include the onco-
gene JUN, MAP4, and CALM1 (Table 2).
Differential cytokine gene expression in the
exposed–control matched pairs. RMA analysis
of the subgroup of 508 cytokine probe sets on
the chip indicated that the expression of
19 cytokine genes was significantly different
between the exposed and control subjects
(Table 3). IFNGR1, IL6R, CCNT2, PBEF1,
and PPP1CB were identified by two probe
sets, so 28 identification numbers (IDs) are
listed in Table 3. The 19 differentially
expressed cytokine genes were also identiﬁed
in the global analysis, but only a few had
p-values low enough to be listed in Tables 1
and 2. However, several had high ratios of dif-
ferential expression between exposed and con-
trols, with PBEF1, IFNGR1, and CXCL16
being increased around 100% (Table 3).
Interestingly, six of the up-regulated genes
were receptors for interleukins 2, 4, 6, 10, and
11 and interferon gamma, the latter being the
most strongly down-regulated cytokine gene.
PF4 was the second most signiﬁcantly down-
regulated gene (Table 3).
Confirmation by real-time PCR. Four
genes—CXCL16, JUN, PTPRE, and
ZNF331—were chosen from the global
analysis and two genes—L4R, PF4—from
the cytokine subset for further study and
conﬁrmation by real-time PCR. We selected
the global analysis genes for further study by
first removing ESTs, hypothetical proteins,
and genes with low levels of expression. From
the remaining genes, we used magnitude and
direction of change and availability of
TMGEAs at the time of this analysis to
decide which to confirm by real-time PCR.
Using these three parameters, we chose three
of the most significantly up-regulated genes
and one strongly down-regulated gene (JUN)
for conﬁrmation. IL4R and PF4 were chosen
for confirmation from the cytokine subset
because they were, respectively, the most sig-
nificantly up-regulated and down-regulated
cytokine genes for which TMGEAs were
available at the time of this analysis.
Real-time PCR of RNA from the six
exposed–control pairs tested by GeneChips
confirmed that CXCL16 and ZNF331 were
consistently up-regulated in exposed individu-
als (mean increases of 103% and 113%,
respectively) and that JUN and PF4 were con-
sistently down-regulated in exposed individu-
als (mean decreases of 81% and 58%,
respectively) when compared with unexposed
individuals (Figure 1). These differences in
expression are very similar to those found by
GeneChip analysis (Table 1). Results for
IL4R and PTPRE were less concordant, with
increases in some pairs and decreases in others
(Figure 1).

sion of the differentially expressed genes.

13 highly exposed subjects (mean benzene =
43.7 ± 23.9 ppm) and 15 controls was exam-

included). The exposed and unexposed sub-
jects were matched on the basis of gender (p =

and recent infections (Table 4). We also tested
the effect of each covariate, and none nega-
tively confounded (i.e., weakened) the impact
of benzene exposure on any of the end points.

up-regulated, and JUN and PF4 signiﬁcantly
down-regulated (Table 4). Thus, CXCL16,
ZNF331, JUN, and PF4 are four genes clearly
identiﬁed as being differentially expressed after
benzene exposure.
Lack of potential confounding by changes
in lymphocyte subsets. It is well established that
benzene lowers peripheral blood lymphocyte
counts (Qu et al. 2002; Rothman et al. 1996),
and certain lymphocyte subsets may be more
sensitive to benzene’s effects than are others.
This raises a concern that our ﬁndings could be
explained in part by a different distribution of
lymphocyte subset populations in workers
exposed to benzene compared with controls.
To address this potential confounding, we ﬁrst
evaluated the distribution of all measured cell
populations that comprise the PBMCs from
which mRNA was isolated (Table 5). Total
mononuclear cells (i.e., monocytes, CD4+ T,
CD8+ T, CD19+ B), lymphocytes, and CD56
(NK) cells were significantly decreased in
exposed workers compared with controls (p =
0.0052; Table 5). Further, the percentage of
total mononuclear cells composed of B cells
(i.e., B-cell mononuclear percentage) in the
exposed workers was signiﬁcantly less than that
in controls (p = 0.0061), whereas the CD8+
T-cell mononuclear percentage was signifi-
cantly increased (p = 0.0096). Using linear
regression, we determined that the proportion
of the mononuclear cell fraction made up by
each of the five cell types had no impact on
expression of CXCL16, ZNF331, JUN, and
PF4. Further, the strength and direction of the
association between benzene exposure and
gene expression were only minimally changed
after adjusting for both CD8+ T-cell and
CD19+ B-cell mononuclear cell number and
percentages.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst molecular
epidemiologic study to use whole-genome
Affymetrix GeneChips for in vivo studies of
the effects of a speciﬁc chemical exposure in
humans. A limited number of earlier studies
have looked at selected subsets of genes (Wu
et al. 2003) or at the effects of smoking
(Lampe et al. 2004), but none has examined
differences in expression in the transcriptome
in the context of benzene exposure. Using a
relatively small sample size of six matched
pairs of exposed and control subjects, we
have been able to identify differentially
expressed genes in the PBMC of benzene-
exposed individuals that could be conﬁrmed
and measured by real-time PCR.
A global analysis of 45,000 probe sets,
representing approximately 33,000 well-
substantiated human genes, was performed
on the GeneChips using stabilized PBMC
RNA collected in the ﬁeld in China as part of
a large molecular epidemiology study of
benzene-exposed workers (Vermeulen et al.
2004). Although the results will differ based
on both the type of processing (e.g., RMA)
and adjustment for multiple testing (e.g.,
FWER with bootstrapping), our results
showed that, in the six pairs examined, a
potentially large number (> 2,100) of probe
sets were (statistically) differentially expressed
in the benzene-exposed subjects compared
with the control, unexposed subjects. Because
the accuracy of this bootstrapping technique is
based on asymptotic theory, a 5% FWER is
not guaranteed, and thus the statistical results
should not be the only criterion for identifying
genes for more detailed study. However, by
ranking the differentially expressed probe sets
identiﬁed in the global gene analysis by unad-
justed p-value, we were able to identify the
top 50 that were highly likely to be differen-
tially expressed. We chose four of the known
genes from this list for conﬁrmation by real-
time PCR. We also increased our probability
of ﬁnding genes altered by benzene exposure
by performing an analysis of the limited subset
of 508 cytokine probe sets on the GeneChips.
The equivalent analysis of this subgroup indi-
cated that the expression of 19 cytokine genes
was signiﬁcantly different between the exposed
and control subjects, and two of these were
chosen for conﬁrmation by real-time PCR.
Genes were chosen for real-time PCR
confirmation based on the availability of

TMGEA, fold change of expression, and
expected copy number. Genes thought to be
expressed at very low levels were avoided
because these have much higher relative meas-
urement error rates (Novak et al. 2002) and
because availability of RNA for conﬁrmation
was limited. The six genes chosen for further
study were CXCL16, JUN, PTPRE, ZNF331,
IL4R, and PF4. TBP was chosen as the
endogenous control gene because recent
research suggests it is well suited for real-time
PCR investigations of lymphocytes (Lossos
et al. 2003) and it is on a different chromo-
some (6q) from the other genes investigated.
This means that gross genetic events (chro-
mosome duplications, deletions, etc.), which
may alter the copy number of the genes
investigated, will not affect the control gene.
GeneChip ﬁndings in the six pairs of sub-
jects for ZNF331, CXCL16, PF4, and JUN
were all shown to be concordant with real-time
PCR data. For IL4R and PTPRE there was less
consistency between the GeneChip findings
and those by real-time PCR in the six pairs
(Figure 1). Low copy number can be ruled out
as an explanation for the discrepancies between
GeneChip and real-time PCR findings for
IL4R and PTPRE because they were detected
at levels similar to those of the other four
genes. One possible explanation is that the
Affymetrix probes for these genes are at the 3′
end of transcripts whereas the probes for the
IL4R and PTPRE TMGEAs span exons farther
upstream. The different target sequences might
explain the discrepancies found in relative
expression. Results of real-time PCR using the
second-round cRNA used for hybridization to
the GeneChips were not signiﬁcantly different
from those described in Figure 1 (data not
shown). This suggests that differences were not
caused by use of the Small Sample Target
Labeling Assay Version II protocol.
In a larger set of 28 study subjects, all four
concordant genes were shown to be consis-
tently altered by benzene exposure: CXCL16
and ZNF331 were up-regulated, whereas JUN
and PF4 were down-regulated. Alteration in
the expression of any of the four genes could
be a consequence of upstream events.
However, it is also possible that germline vari-
ation in one or more regulatory regions of
these four genes could be particularly suscepti-
ble to the effects of benzene exposure. Further
studies are needed to investigate genetic varia-
tion across each of these genes to determine if
one or more variants could be functionally
important in benzene exposure. The identiﬁ-
cation of interactions between genetic variants
and benzene’s effects could lead to further
insights into the mechanisms associated with
benzene-induced leukemia and other hemato-
logic diseases.
CXCL16 is also known as SR-PSOX or
CXCLG16 and maps to chromosome 17p13.
It encodes chemokine (C-X-C motif) lig-
and 16, a scavenger receptor that mediates
adhesion and phagocytosis of both Gram-
negative and Gram-positive bacteria. This
facilitates the uptake of various pathogens
and chemotaxis of T cell and NK T cells by
antigen-presenting cells through its chemokine
domain (Shimaoka et al. 2003). ZNF331 is a
member of the Krüppel-related family of zinc
ﬁnger proteins that contain a Krüppel associ-
ated box (KRAB) domain and is likely a tran-
scriptional repressor (Meiboom et al. 2003).
The ZNF331 gene lies close to a frequent
breakpoint region of follicular thyroid adeno-
mas (Meiboom et al. 2003), but the question
of why benzene should so markedly affect
ZNF331 expression remains unclear at present.
The JUN, FOS, MAF, and A TF subfami-
lies are dimeric, basic region–leucine zipper
proteins that make up the AP-1 transcription
factor. AP-1 transcription factors (Shaulian and
Karin 2002) are involved in both the induction
and prevention of apoptosis, depending on tis-
sue type (Shaulian and Karin 2002). As part of
AP-1, JUN is primarily a positive regulator of
proliferation. JUN-deficient fibroblasts have
marked proliferative defects in vitro (Schreiber
et al. 1999; Wisdom et al. 1999), and prolifer-
ation of JUN-deﬁcient hepatocytes is severely
impaired during liver regeneration in vivo
(Bakiri et al. 2000; Behrens et al. 2002;
Schreiber et al. 1999). In mouse erythro-
leukemia and ﬁbroblast cells, inhibition of fos
and jun has demonstrated their requirement
for proliferation and cell-cycle progression
(Shaulian and Karin 2001). The lower levels of
JUN could thus be indicative that the PBMCs
of benzene-exposed individuals are not prolif-
erating or progressing through the cell cycle as
quickly as those of nonexposed individuals.
PF4, also known as CXCL4, is a polypep-
tide constituent of platelet alpha granules that
is released during platelet aggregation and
inhibits heparin-mediated reactions. PF4 has
been shown to have numerous other biologic
properties, including inhibiting endothelial

(Gupta and Singh 1994; Maione et al. 1990;
Niewiarowski et al. 1976) and inhibiting
T-cell function by down-modulating cell
proliferation and cytokine release (Fleischer
et al. 2002). PF4 is expressed exclusively in
platelets, megakaryocytes, and their precursors
(Doi et al. 1987), and its down-regulation in
benzene-exposed workers probably reflects
decreased expression in platelets or progenitor
cells because they are present in the PBMC
fraction.
We explored whether increased and
decreased expression of these genes after ben-
zene exposure was a reﬂection an alteration in
the subset make up of the PBMC population.
Although benzene exposure did cause changes
in the subset makeup of the PBMC fraction
(Table 5), these changed proportions had no
impact on expression of CXCL16, ZNF331,
JUN, and PF4, and the strength and direction
of the association between benzene exposure
and gene expression was minimally changed
after adjusting for both CD8+ T-cell and
B-cell mononuclear cell counts and percent-
ages. Thus, the altered expression was not
likely to be caused by changes in the make up
of the PBMC fraction. Unfortunately, the
subjects studied here were selected to have a
high level of benzene exposure to make this
initial exploratory effort as efﬁcient as possible
by maximizing the contrast between the
exposed workers and controls. Consequently,
the exposure range was too narrow to be able
to detect a dose–response relationship among
exposed workers, which was not a goal of this
study. In the future, we plan to analyze sub-
stantially more samples selected from workers
with a wide range of benzene exposure to
allow us to construct a detailed model of the
dose–response relationship.
Generating relative expression using RMA
combined with a bootstrapping method for
controlling the FWER appears to be an effec-
tive way to identify genes associated with
chemical exposure. The relative expression of
a subset of six genes (all selected as statistically
differentially expressed from GeneChips)
were conﬁrmed by real-time PCR in either all
or most of the six exposed–unexposed pairs
analyzed and in a larger data set from 28 sub-
jects. There was also remarkable consistency
between the real-time data and the differential
expression ratios calculated by RMA for at
least four of these genes. Larger data sets will
be needed if we are to characterize a pattern
of gene expression related to benzene expo-
sure using machine-learning algorithms.
However, we did attempt to explore gene
ontology with the program EASE (Expression
Analysis Systematic Explorer; Hosack et al.
2003) using the current data set and found
that immune response genes gave the largest
number of significant population hits,
supporting our decision to analyze cytokine
genes as a subset.
In conclusion, we have shown that
microarray analysis can be a good tool for dis-
covering genes of potential mechanistic inter-
est or biomarkers of exposure and early effect
in molecular epidemiologic studies of popula-
tions exposed to potential carcinogens.
Further, only small numbers of paired study
subjects are required to identify differentially
expressed genes, making such studies cost-
effective. The small-sample protocol used
here also limits the amount of high-quality
RNA required, meaning that archived sam-
ples, stored by partial isolation and stabiliza-
tion of the RNA in the ﬁeld, are amenable to
analysis. These studies therefore provide a
model for biomarker discovery in chemically
exposed human populations, although with
lower exposed populations it may be neces-
sary to study more subject pairs, with 15 pairs
probably being ideal. Because the price of
global gene expression arrays is decreasing,
such studies are becoming more feasible.
