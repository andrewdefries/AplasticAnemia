Abstract: Although long considered to be cellular debris, microparticles (MPs) are more
recently considered reﬂective of cellular stimulation, activation, and degeneration/apoptosis.
MPs that arise from the cellular components of blood and the endothelial lining of blood ves-
sels are referred to as blood MPs and by general consensus are small (р1.5 μm), expose the
anionic phospholipid (PL) phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer leaﬂet of their membrane, and
bear surface membrane antigens reﬂecting their cellular origin. This brief review summarizes
the different approaches used by several groups to study blood MPs. The aim of this article is
to review the technical aspects of characterizing the morphological and functional properties
of blood MPs with emphasis on the preanalytical and analytical variables involved in these
studies.
Keywords: microparticles, ﬂow cytometry, techniques
Introduction
Cellular microparticles (MPs) are fragments of the plasma membrane that are shed by
virtually all cell when subject to a number of stress conditions, including cellular activa-
tion and apoptosis (Beaudoin and Grondin 1991; Zwaal and Schroit 1997; Freyssinet
et al 1999; Hugel et al 2005). Since the description of “platelet dust” by Wolf (1967),
numerousstudieshavereportedthepresenceofsubcellularvesiclesincentrifugedplasma.
Although long considered to be cellular debris, blood MPs are more recently considered
reﬂective of cellular stimulation, activation, and degeneration/apoptosis (Freyssinet
2003; Morel et al 2005; Boulanger et al 2006). By general consensus, MPs are small in
size (Յ1.5 μm), expose the anionic phospholipid (PL) phosphatidylserine (PS) on the
outer leaﬂet of their membrane, and bear surface membrane antigens reﬂecting their
cell of origin (Jy et al 2004). MPs that arise from the cellular components of blood and
the endothelial lining of blood vessels are referred to as blood MPs. Apart from blood
MPs, plasma contains smaller membrane vesicles (40–100 nm) termed exosomes and
larger vesicles (Ͼ1.5 μm) termed apoptotic bodies that are derived from blood and
vascular cells (Heijnen et al 1999; Freyssinet 2003). The aim of this article is to review
the technical aspects of characterizing the morphological and functional properties of
blood MPs with emphasis on both preanalytical and analytical variables.
Membrane phospholipid asymmetry
and microparticle formation
All cell type’s spontaneously shed blebs from their plasma membranes in an active
process that appears to be important for membrane remodeling and antigenic turn-
over. In resting cells, the negatively charged phospholipids, including PS, are almost
exclusively present in the inner leaﬂet of the cell membrane (Zwaal and Schroit 1997).
Among the mechanisms proposed to account for this asymmetry are unidirectional
enzymatic movement by an aminophospholipid translocase and/or association between
Vascular Health and Risk Management 2008:4(4)770
Shet
the negatively charged phospholipids and elements in the
cytoplasm, including cytoskeletal elements and their accom-
panying proteins (Bevers et al 1998). MP release is an integral
part of the cell membrane remodeling process whereby the
normal asymmetric distribution of phospholipids between the
two leaﬂets of the plasma membrane is lost. Calcium entry,
activation of calpain and scramblase activity are thought
to be important steps in the loss of lipid asymmetry and
microparticle formation, but the exact sequence of events is
not completely understood (Fox et al 1990; Yano et al 1994;
Dachary-Prigent et al 1995, 1997; Pasquet et al 1996, 1998;
Bucki et al 1998, 2006; Kunzelmann-Marche et al 2001).
The possible pathways leading to membrane budding and
MP release have been recently reviewed (Freyssinet 2003;
Boulanger et al 2006).
Membrane shedding by blood cells
Erythrocytes
Shedding processes are found in a variety of blood cells
(Beaudoin and Grondin 1991). Human erythrocytes treated
with ionophore A23187 in the presence of calcium, respond
by budding to release MPs. Normal erythrocytes also release
MPs following ATP depletion, heat treatment (49 °C),
incubation at pH 5.4 and incubation with diamide (5 mMol/L)
(Wagner et al 1986). Erythrocyte MPs are also found to be
elevated in several pathological conditions associated with
hemolysis (Hugel et al 1999) but are notably elevated in
sickle cell anemia (Allan et al 1982). Erythrocyte-derived
MPs are usually identiﬁed by the binding of antibodies to
glycophorin A (CD235a), a protein uniquely expressed on
the erythrocyte membrane.
White blood cells
These cells have a unique physiological role in inﬂammation,
immune regulation, and thrombosis. Following exposure to
various stimuli including lipopolysaccharide and phorbol
myrisitate, monocytes are observed to vesiculate and release
MPs (Satta et al 1994; Mesri and Altieri 1999). Monocytes
express CD14, the lipopolysaccharide receptor strongly on
their surface while granulocytes express CD14 weakly. Thus,
monocyte-derived MPs have been identiﬁed by the surface
expression of CD14. MPs derived from neutrophils have been
identiﬁed in the blood of normal subjects and in patients with
meningoccocal sepsis (Nieuwland et al 2000). Typically,
polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leukocyte-derived MPs are
identiﬁed using the leukocyte-speciﬁc markers lactoferrin
or CD66b. Lymphocyte-derived MP have been identiﬁed
using lymphocyte-speciﬁc markers CD4 and CD8 (Arm-
strong et al 1988; Aupeix et al 1997; Diamant et al 2002;
Martin et al 2004).
Platelets
Microparticle formation in platelets occurs as a result
of activation by various stimuli (epinephrine, adenosine
diphosphate, collagen, thrombin, A23187) (Horstman and
Ahn 1999) and during storage (Bode et al 1991). Increased
platelet MP formation has been documented in a variety
of clinical conditions that are associated with platelet
activation (Solum 1999). Platelet-derived MPs that express
surface glycoproteins and antibodies to CD41, CD42, and
CD61 have been used to detect platelet-derived MPs (Lee
et al 1996; Combes et al 1997; Diamant et al 2002). CD61
is less speciﬁc as a platelet marker since this integrin is
also expressed on blood monocytes and antibodies that
recognize on the CD61 epitope will identify both platelet-
and monocyte-derived MPs.
Endothelial cells
Endothelial cells undergo injury and vesiculation following
in vitro exposure to complement, thrombin and a variety of
agents such as ionophore, lipopolysaccharide, autoantibodies,
and cytokines (interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α)
(Hamilton et al 1990; Combes et al 1999). Elevated endo-
thelial MPs have been documented in several pathological
situations including atherosclerosis, sepsis, and diabetes
mellitus. Several endothelial speciﬁc antibodies have been
used to detect MPs in these situations including CD31, CD51,
CD105, CD144, and CD146 (Sabatier et al 2002). Of this
extensive list, CD144 and CD146 are endothelial-speciﬁc
markers as they have not yet been found expressed on any
other blood cell in humans.
Assays to characterize
microparticles
In general, most assays have focused on characterizing
the antigenic composition of cellular microparticles
using antibody capture-based ELISA (Aupeix et al 1997;
Freyssinet et al 1999; Mallat et al 1999) or ﬂow cytometry
(Combes et al 1997, 1999). Most investigators have elected
to characterize blood MPs using ﬂow cytometry and the
technical protocols of some have been reviewed in a recent
forum (Jy et al 2004). In addition to analyzing MP antigens,
several investigators have assessed the coagulant function
of blood microparticles using functional assays (Westerman
et al 1984; Mallat et al 1999; Berckmans et al 2001; Joop
et al 2001; Shet et al 2003; Aras et al 2004). These assays
Vascular Health and Risk Management 2008:4(4) 771
Characterizing blood microparticles
either measure acceleration of plasmatic coagulation by MP-
derived phospholipids or triggering of plasmatic coagulation
by MP-associated tissue factor. The PF3 assay, in which
exposure of platelet poor plasma to Russell’s viper venom
in the presence of calcium causes coagulation, but only in
the presence of certain phospholipids (supplied by blood
MPs), has also been used as a functional assay (Hardisty
and Hutton 1965).
Preanalytical variables
The measurement of blood MPs requires careful attention to
collection and processing of blood samples. While there have
been some general guidelines regarding preanalytical vari-
ables that may be important, these have been more consensus-
driven statements rather than guidelines based on scientiﬁc
evidence. Furthermore, several aspects of blood collection
such as venepuncture needle size, use of a tourniquet during
blood collection, phlebotomy using a vacutainer vs a syringe,
and the type of anticoagulant used (sodium citrate vs eth-
ylenediaminetetraacetic acid) could have an impact on the
measurement of blood MPs. Additionally, sample processing
following blood collection is extremely variable between
investigators and could be partially responsible for the
discrepancies in blood MPs levels reported in the literature.
While separating the cellular elements of blood from the
plasma containing MPs, careful attention must be paid to
centrifugation speed. In our experience, a 2-step centrifuga-
tion using 1500 × g for 10 minutes and then 13,000 × g for
10 minutes resulted in platelet-free plasma (when assessed
by ﬂow cytometry and light microscopy) (Shet et al 2003).
The second centrifugation step is particularly efﬁcient at
rendering plasma relatively “platelet free” by eliminating
small platelets but it is unclear if large bloods MPs are also
depleted in this process. There are several difﬁculties in sepa-
rating platelets, microparticles, exosomes, and cellular debris
as individual components. We have attempted to isolate
blood MPs from platelet-poor plasma by using a high-speed
centrifugation step. However, the sample that we work with
contains exosomes. Isolating blood MPs from exosomes by
centrifugation is technically challenging and the need for
such separation is probably dependent on the nature of the
study being performed.
Analytical variables
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometric analysis of blood MPs appears to be the
most favored method to characterize blood MPs (Jy et al
2004). Typically, MPs are identiﬁed as particles with a
forward angle light scatter (FALS) smaller than an internal
standard consisting of 1–1.5 μm sized latex particles (Shet
et al 2003). Most investigators do not use a lower size limit
but some have arbitrarily chosen 100 nm below which
particles that are recognized by the instrument are not
considered MPs (Boulanger et al 2006). Others have used
platelets as an internal standard and gated particles with a
FALS value below that of the smallest platelet (Nieuwland
et al 2000). While the identiﬁcation of MPs on the basis
of size using FALS tests the limit of sensitivity of ﬂow
cytometry, some have overcome this problem by adjust-
ing the parameters of the instrument to detect ﬂuorescent
intensity (Horstman et al 1994). Flow cytometry can also be
used to enumerate blood MPs by adding a known number of
ﬂuorescent or nonﬂuorescent latex particles to the sample
prior to performing analysis (Combes et al 1997, 1999; Shet
et al 2003). The number of MPs present in the sample is
derived by dividing the number of MP events counted by
the volume of the sample analyzed, ie, (beads counted/beads
added) × sample volume, and adjusting for the ﬁnal dilu-
tion of the original blood sample. Alternatively, if the ﬂow
cytometry instrument delivers the sample to the optics cell
by screw-driven syringe at a known rate, then the sample
MP count can theoretically be calculated. This method of
enumeration is less desirable since it makes assumptions
regarding the instruments ﬂuidics and has unacceptable
day-to-day variability (Reverter et al 1996).
Antibody capture assays
ELISA-based MP capture assays have been devised and
tested to simplify and semi-automate the characterization
of blood MPs. These assays have utilized annexin V as a
means of capturing phospholipids (Aupeix et al 1997; Mallat
et al 1999) or antibodies to speciﬁc blood MP membrane
antigens, eg, αIIbβ3 (Mallat et al 2000), or antibodies to
nonspeciﬁc blood MP membrane antigens that are shared
by several cell types eg, antibody 1B5 (Aras et al 2004)
and have been reviewed elsewhere (Freyssinet et al 1999).
Such assays have reduced the challenges of analyzing large
sample numbers.
Other assays
In addition to the above techniques, the antigenic char-
acteristics and the membrane composition of blood MPs
have been studied using electron microscopy (Heijnen
et al 1999; Aras et al 2004) (Figure 1 and Figure 2), con-
focal microscopy (Combes et al 1999), high performance
liquid chromatography (Weerheim et al 2002), capillary
Vascular Health and Risk Management 2008:4(4)772
Shet
electrophoresis (Xiong et al 2003), and mass spectrometry
(Jin et al 2005; Miguet et al 2006) with varying degrees of
success. Assays that measure the pro/anticoagulant functions
of blood MPs are somewhat under-utilized perhaps in part
due to the technical challenges in developing standardized
and reproducible assays.
Limitations
Flow cytometry provides useful information about blood
MPs but there are some limitations associated with this tech-
nique that are worth considering. The deﬁnition of a blood
MP using ﬂow cytometry is still an area of great debate.
In our studies, we used somewhat rigid criteria to deﬁne
blood MPs in order to preserve speciﬁcity while sacriﬁcing
sensitivity to a certain extent. Blood MPs were deﬁned as
particles that were 1. Removable from platelet-free plasma
by ultracentrifugation; 2. Were small in size (Յ1μm); and 3.
Labeled with annexin V. While such criteria may be possible
in certain situations, they are not practical or possible in all
conditions. For instance, most would agree that blood MPs
demonstrate surface PS as evidenced by annexin V labeling,
but clearly not all plasma particles Յ1 μm label with annexin
V (Shet et al 2003; Boulanger et al 2006). Furthermore, a
substantial portion of plasma particles Յ1 μm label with
antibodies to cell surface markers, but not annexin V, which
suggests that there are PS (−) blood MPs (Shet et al 2003).
An alternative explanation could be that the exposure of
PS on the outer aspect of some blood MPs is incomplete
resulting in absent/reduced annexin V labeling or that some
MPs contain scramblase activity. Finally, the contribution
of exosomes and apoptotic bodies to the ﬂow cytometric
signal obtained cannot be completely ignored. Thus, while
a consensus ﬂow cytometric deﬁnition of blood MPs would
have utility, one should be aware of the limitations of such
deﬁnitions when studying biological processes. Modern
ﬂow cytometers are equipped with less powerful lasers and
have a threshold for particle size detection ∼500 nm below
which sensitivity is unpredictable according to instrument
manufacturers (Becton Dickenson, San Jose, CA; pers
comm). Detecting MPs using ﬂuorescence as the primary
detection parameter has overcome this problem to a certain
extent, but most investigators do not clearly indicate instru-
ment setting in their description of the methods. Finally, the
choice of well-characterized antibodies directed against a
cell membrane antigen that not shared by other cell lineages
present in blood is an important prerequisite to characterizing
the cellular origin of blood MPs. Such antibodies should be
primarily labeled with a ﬂourophore, as the use of secondary
antibodies is not recommended.
Microparticles in health and disease
The general consensus is that plasma levels of blood MPs
reﬂect equilibrium between their release and their clearance
by monocytes-macrophage system. Since clearance of cells
undergoing apoptosis or injury is extremely efﬁcient, the

Characterizing blood microparticles
presence of blood MPs is considered an objective in vitro
parameter that serves as evidence of deleterious cellular
alterations in vivo. However, very little is published about
the clearance and fate of blood MPs in any speciﬁc disease
state leaving one to speculate that their presence reﬂects
either a defect in recognition of these particles or an over-
whelming of the clearance mechanism by their sheer number
(Willekens et al 2005). Experimental evidence both in vitro
and in vivo has demonstrated that blood MPs are capable of
inﬂuencing diverse biological function (Zwaal and Schroit
1997; Barry and FitzGerald 1999; Horstman and Ahn 1999;
Mesri and Altieri 1999; Freyssinet 2003; Hugel et al 2005;
Boulanger et al 2006). Blood MPs have been associated with
several disease processes and while they seem to be useful
markers there is insufﬁcient evidence to demonstrate that
this association is causal. Clearly, elevated blood MPs in
several disease processes result from inﬂammation, cellular
activation and apoptosis. Such MPs, through their diverse
biological effects, unequivocally contribute to vascular
disease and comorbidity and are therefore likely to be very
important in the disease process.
Conclusion
Several studies clearly demonstrate that blood MPs could
be mediators of disease in some cases, markers of disease
in other cases, and have prognostic potential, but the patho-
physiological relevance of blood MPs is still in its infancy.
Many of the studies mentioned in this review demonstrate that
detection, phenotypic characterization, and quantiﬁcation of
blood MPs are interesting and potentially valuable in patients
that are at risk for vascular events. However, conversion of
this potential into a reality will necessitate a standardized
approach to the detection and characterization of blood MP.
In addition, attention to the preanalytical and analytical
variables and reﬁnement in the techniques used to assess
the cellular origin of blood MPs could help shed light on the
mechanisms of MP release, function, and clearance.
