Abstract
Background: To determine the association of human papillomavirus infection (HPV) and
transitional cell carcinoma (TCC).
Methods: Using polymerase chain reaction, fifty-nine bladder tissue specimens of patients with
transitional cell carcinoma of bladder compared with 20 bladder samples of cases with non-
neoplastic disorders.
Results: Male to female ratio was similar in the two groups (50/9 vs. 16/4, P = 0.62). Mean age was
67 ± 10.8 years and 52 ± 20.3 years in the case and control groups, respectively (P = 0.6). Of the
59 tissue specimens with diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma, HPV DNA was detected in 21
(35.6%) samples, while it was present in only one sample (5%) in the control group (P = 0.008).
HPV18 was the most common type of virus with the incidence rate of 17/21(81%).
Conclusion: HPV might play a causative role in transitional cell carcinoma of bladder in our
geographic area.
Background
The etiology of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), which
represents 90 percent of bladder malignancies, is not quite
clear, while squamous cell carcinoma (5%) of the bladder
is well associated with some factors like urinary stones
and prolonged infections. Some genital malignancies like
vulvar or cervical neoplasms are associated with previous
infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). Recently,
conflicting findings have been reported on association of
HPV infection and TCC [1-5].
Using PCR, the overall prevalence of human papillomavi-
rus (HPV) DNA in penile carcinoma is about 40–45%,
which is similar to the detection rate of HPV-DNA in vul-
var carcinoma [6]. Males may be carriers of oncogenic
HPVs and male partners may markedly contribute to the

risk of developing cervical cancer in their female partners
[7]. HPV detection rate in cases of invasive cervical cancer
can be as high as 90 % [8]. Because of vicinity of bladder
to mucosal surface of urogenital tract, HPV may play a sig-
nificant role in TCCs.
While Kamel et al found HPV DNA in 57% of cases of TCC
[1], Tekin's study [9] and Mvula's report [10] did not sup-
port the etiologic role of HPV in bladder carcinogenesis.
In the present study, we compared the rate of HPV positiv-
ity in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from the
urinary bladder of patients with transitional cell carcino-
mas and non-neoplastic bladder tissue samples. To our
knowledge, this is one of limited number of studies that
used non-neoplastic bladder tissue specimens as controls.
Methods
The medical records and bladder tissue specimens of 59
consecutive patients with transitional cell carcinoma of
bladder who underwent transurethral resection of bladder
tissue from October1999 to May 2002 were reviewed and
compared with those of 20 consecutive patients with non-
neoplastic disorders who were served as controls. So, a
total of 79 biopsy tissues of urinary bladder were re-eval-
uated and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
The designing and conducting of this study was in accord-
ance with the ethical standards of UNRC ethics commit-
tee. Table 1 demonstrates histopathological diagnosis of
specimens in the control group in detail. Since there are
infrequent indications for bladder tissue sampling in non-
neoplastic conditions, comparing to malignant lesions,
we found only 20 non-neoplastic bladder tissue speci-
mens.
Sample
Specimens were taken from paraffin-embeded bladder tis-
sues stored in laboratory of our hospital- Tajrish Shohada
medical center. All specimens were collected and trans-
ported to molecular biology research center of shaheed
Beheshti University of Medical Sciences under a well-con-
trolled condition. Biopsy specimens were digested in lyses
buffer (0.33 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris bas, 5 mM MgCl2, 2%
Titon X-100) at 37°C for 4 hours. Phenol-chloroform
extraction and ethanol precipitation were performed. The

precipitated DNA was suspended in distilled water and
used for amplification.
Primers
Two primer pairs were designed of HPV L1 gene (encodes
the major capsid protein): one primer pair amplify a 269-
bp fragment of HPV 6, 11, 31 and 33, and another primer
pair amplify a 564-bp fragment of HPV 16, 18 and 35; and
HPV types were defined by PCR products restriction anal-
ysis. PCR: Amplifications were carried out in 50-µl vol-
umes. The reaction mixture contained 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1
mM of each dNTP, 20 pico mol of each primer, 0.1 µg
DNA, 1.25 unit of Taq DAN polymerase and 1× PCR
buffer. PCR conditions are: 30 cycles of denaturing at
94°C for 30 sec., annealing temperature at 45°C for 30
sec. and extension at 72°C for 30 sec. PCR reaction was
performed using automated thermal cycler machine
(model personal, Eppendorf Co, Germany).
Electrophoresis
PCR products were electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel.
Gels were stained by ethidium bromide and photo-
graphed by UV transilluminator at 254 nm.
Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney,
chi-square and fisher's exact tests as appropriate with sig-
nificance considered at P < 0.05.
Results
The study population comprised 59 cases and 20 controls
whose demographic and clinical characteristics are given
in table 2. There was no difference in male to female ratio
in the two groups (50/9 vs. 16/4, P = 0.62). Mean age was
67 ± 10.8 (range 38 to 85) years and 52 ± 20.3 (range18
to 81) years in the case and control groups, respectively (P
= 0.6).
Of the 59 tissue specimens with diagnosis of transitional
cell carcinoma, HPV DNA was detected in 21 (35.6%)
samples. Human papillomavirus DNA was positive in
only one sample (5%) in the control group (P = 0.008)
that was histolologically diagnosed as severe chronic cys-
titis with some degrees of atypical hyperplasia, that might
be considered as a pre-malignant condition.
Type specific primers also analyzed the positive samples.
In the case group, sequences of HPV 6 genome were
detected in 2/21 patients (9.5%), one male and 1 female;
HPV 18 was found in 14/21 patients (66.7%),13 males
and 1 female ; and HPV 33 sequences were detected in2/
21(9.5%), 1 male and 1 female. In 3 HPV-positive male
cases (14.3%) more than one type was found; 2 patients
with HPV6/HPV18, and 1 witht HPV18/HPV33. Thus,
HPV18 was the most common type of virus with the inci-
dence rate of 17/21(81%). HPV18 was also found in one
male patient in the control group. HPV types 11, 16, 31
were present in no tissue specimens. Table 3 shows HPV
types in two groups, distinctly.
The histopathological stages and grades of tissue samples
with diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma considering
infection with HPV are given in Table 4. No significant
correlation existed between tumor stages and presence of
HPV. Additionally, there was no significant difference
between low-grade (grade 1 and 2) and high grade (grade
3) tumors with regard to HPV infection (36% Vs.33.3%, P
= 0.59).
Smoking rate in the case group was significantly higher
than control group (54.2% vs 10%, P = 0.00). In the case
group, 12 out of 21 (57%) infected patients and 20 out of
38 (52.6%) non-infected were cigarette smokers, respec-
tively (P = 0.7). Ten cases (16.9%) but no patient in the
control group were addicted to opium (P = 0.05). On the
other hand, four infected (18.2%) and 6 non-infected
(10.5%) subjects were addicted to opium (P = 0.36).
Discussion
One of the most common malignancies, especially in
developing countries, is transitional cell carcinoma of the
bladder. Several chemical agents have been suspected to
have a role in its development. HPV plays an etiological
role for genital tumors, but the exact effect of this virus in
transitional cell carcinoma of bladder is still vague. More
than a decade ago, a report of HPV-16 positive bladder
carcinoma in a patient with attenuated natural killer cell
function and aplastic anemia was published [11]. In the
same year, another paper briefed a transplant patient with
bladder tumor in whom HPV 11 was detected [12].
Agliano and colleagues investigated the presence of HPV
types 16 and 18 DNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embed-
ded tissues from the urinary bladder (46 transitional cell
carcinomas and 10 non-neoplastic normal urinary sam-
ples) of non-immune deficient cases. HPV16 and/or

HPV18 genomes were detected in 23 of 46 (50%) bladder
carcinomas and in none of 10 (0%) non-neoplastic uri-
nary samples[13]. In 1995, Kamel et al. analyzed 47 blad-
der carcinomas for the presence of DNA-HPV subtypes 6,
11, 16, 18, 31 and 33 by nucleic acid in situ hybridization.
HPV DNA was found in 27/47 (57%) bladder carcinomas,
with multiple subtypes in 20 cases (76). To our knowl-
edge, our study has one of the largest control groups of
non-neoplastic bladder tissue specimens. The high preva-
lence of HPV infection in the present study demonstrates
an association between HPV and TCC of the bladder.
Human papillomavirus seems to be related to the etiology
of bladder tumor because of its high prevalence in sam-
ples obtained from bladder tumors in the present study
and some previous researches. Our study demonstrated
HPV-positivity rate in 35.6% of cases and 5% of controls.
It seems that carcinoma development may be triggered by
HPV infection. Inactivation of the tumor suppressor pRB
by the human papillomavirus (HPV) oncoprotein E7 is a
mechanism by which HPV promotes cell growth [14].
Human papillomavirus type 16 proteins, E6 and E7, have
been shown to cause centrosome amplification and lag-
ging chromosomes during mitosis, leading to chromo-
somal instability. Genomic instability is thought to be an
essential part of the conversion of a normal cell to a cancer
cell [15] Kamel and colleagues demonstrated concurrent
HPV positivity and abnormal p53 protein accumulation
in 18 out of 47 cases, 14 showing the presence of HPV
subtypes 16 and/or 18 DNA[1]. In our study, HPV 18 was
the most frequent type(81%) requiring more specific epi-
demiologic studies and experimental investigations.
HPV may have a great role in progression of TCCs toward
higher stages and/or grades by inactivation of the tumor
suppressors or other unknown mechanisms.
Larue et al. reported that sensitivity of detection of HPV is
largely dependent on a series of technical factors such as
tissue fixation, DNA preparation and amplification condi-
tions. In their study, presence of HPV correlated with
grade but not stage of the tumors. [16]. Our specimens
were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from the
urinary bladder. Using fresh or frozen tumor material will
probably increase the sensitivity. The high incidence dem-
onstrated in the present study might be higher if fresh
specimens were available and used in order to overcome
the probability of qualitative loss of DNA in the material.
High rate of HPV positivity in present study suggests that
other sexually transmissible viruses may play some roles
in development and progression of transitional cell carci-
noma of the bladder. As Gazzaniga et al demonstrated,
there may be a high synergism between Human Papillo-
maviruses type 16 and 18 (HPV 16, HPV 18), Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex
virus type 2 (HSV-2) and bladder carcinogenesis[17]. In
this regard, further investigation with a large number of
patients sounds to be required.
On the basis of high rate of HPV positivity in TCC cases
(35.6%), comparing with control group(5%), the present
report supports an etiologic role of HPV in bladder car-
cinogenesis.
Conclusion
This quasi-experimental study is the first report from Iran
on HPV infection and transitional cell carcinoma. Our
findings, in spite of some previous reports, suggest that
HPV may play a causative role in transitional cell carci-
noma of bladder in our geographic area. Public education
regarding HPV transmission and high-risk behavior may
be helpful for decreasing the incidence of urogenital
malignancies.
