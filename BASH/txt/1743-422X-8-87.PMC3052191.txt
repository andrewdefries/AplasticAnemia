Abstract
Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is an uncommon but distinct variant of aplastic anemia in which
pancytopenia appears two to three months after an acute attack of hepatitis. HAAA occurs most frequently in
young male children and is lethal if leave untreated. The etiology of this syndrome is proposed to be attributed to
various hepatitis and non hepatitis viruses. Several hepatitis viruses such as HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HEV and HGV
have been associated with this set of symptoms. Viruses other than the hepatitis viruses such as parvovirus B19,
Cytomegalovirus, Epstein bar virus, Transfusion Transmitted virus (TTV) and non-A-E hepatitis virus (unknown
viruses) has also been documented to develop the syndrome. Considerable evidences including the clinical
features, severe imbalance of the T cell immune system and effective response to immunosuppressive therapy
strongly present HAAA as an immune mediated mechanism. However, no association of HAAA has been found
with blood transfusions, drugs and toxins. Besides hepatitis and non hepatitis viruses and immunopathogenesis
phenomenon as causative agents of the disorder, telomerase mutation, a genetic factor has also been predisposed
for the development of aplastic anemia. Diagnosis includes clinical manifestations, blood profiling, viral serological
markers testing, immune functioning and bone marrow hypocellularity examination. Patients presenting the
features of HAAA have been mostly treated with bone marrow or hematopoietic cell transplantation from HLA
matched donor, and if not available then by immunosuppressive therapy. New therapeutic approaches involve the
administration of steroids especially the glucocorticoids to augment the immunosuppressive therapy response.
Pancytopenia following an episode of acute hepatitis response better to hematopoietic cell transplantation than
immunosuppressive therapy.
Background
Aplastic anemia, acquire or congenital anemia associated
with hypoplastic “fatty or empty” bone marrow and glo-
bal dyshematopoiesis, has been first described by Paul
Ehrlich in year 1888 [1]. The pathophysiology is believed
to be idiopathic [2] or immune-mediated phenomenon
with active destruction of haematopoietic stem cells [3].
The abnormal immune response may be elicited by
environmental exposures, such as to chemicals, drugs,
viral infections and endogenous antigens generated by
genetically altered bone marrow cells [4]. A small frac-
tion of the genes involved in pancytopenia has been
represented by the congenital BM failure syndromes
(relatively rare) which lately develop in clinical syn-
dromes as Fanconi’s anemia, Dyskeratosis Congenita,
and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome [5,6].
Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is a well
recognized and distinct variant of clinical syndrome,
acquired aplastic anemia, in which an acute attack of
hepatitis leads to the marrow failure and pancytopenia
[7-9]. HAAA has been first reported in two cases by
Lorenz and Quaiser in 1955 [8] and the number of the
cases increase up to value of 200 by the year 1975
[10-12]. However, this syndrome has been reported in
2-5% cases of west and 4-10% in area of more prevalent
to hepatitis and Human Immunodeficiency Viruses
(HIV) in the Far East [12,13], it belongs to the area of
low socioeconomic status [14,15]. HAAA is not consid-
ered relative to age, sex and severity of hepatitis [14],
predominantly it has been found in children [13], ado-
lescent boys and in young aged men [10,16].
The onset of syndrome, pancytopenia, usually takes
two to three months [62 days: ranging from 14 to 225)
after attack of acute hepatitis [12,14]. Hepatitis asso-
ciated with aplastic anemia may be acute and chronic
[7], mild and transient [16], self-limiting and fulminant

and the development of AA is always fatal if not treated
on time [7,10]. Majority of the cases have been found as
fulminant where the mortality rate reaches up to 85%
[17]. Aetiology of the syndrome has been attributed to
various agents and factors [7] which may include patho-
genic viruses, autoimmune responses, liver transplanta-
tion procedure [18] bone marrow transplantation,
radiation [19] and drugs administered to control the
viral replication [14].
Aplastic anemia associated hepatitis viruses
Several hepatitis viruses such as Hepatitis A [20], B
[21,22], C [23], and E, G [24] have been anticipated to
be associated with this set of symptoms [7]. No associa-
tion has been found with blood transfusion, toxins and
drugs [17]. In one study Safadi and co-workers (2001)
found out that sera of eight of the patients had the exis-
tence of Hepatitis Bc IgG and/or anti-HBs antibodies
which was suggested due to past exposure and immu-
nizing effect and they were unable to establish any
direct relation with acute hepatitis B [14]. As non-A,
non-B hepatitis agents are usually responsible for the
hepatitis associated aplastic anemia; the prevalence of
anti-hepatitis C virus antibodies is similar in HAAA and
aplasia of other origins [25]. HCV seropositivity has
been observed in the patients developing cytopenia fol-
lowing non-A non-B hepatitis (NANBH). HCV viremia
has been frequently observed without detecting anti-
HCV antibodies in patients’ blood reflecting the transfu-
sion associated HCV infection [25,26]. However, it has
also been reported that HCV is not generally implicated
as a causative agent of hepatitis preceding aplastic
anemia [27].
Hepatitis G virus (HGV) has been reported as a possi-
ble etiological agent of acute hepatitis, chronic liver dys-
funtioning, and fulminant hepatitis and hepatitis
associated aplastic anemia. A relation of Hepatitis G
virus with hepatitis subsequently developing in the
aplastic anemia has been seen in a 24 years old person
by measuring the hematological, biochemical, serological
and virological parameters and detecting HGV RNA in
his serum by PCR and electro-immunoassay [24].
The development of aplastic anemia generally found
to occur in hepatitis not caused by the hepatitis A and
hepatitis B viruses commonly known as the non-A and
non-B hepatitis associated aplastic anemia which were
reported in above than 80% of the cases of hepatitis pre-
ceding severe cytopenia [28,29].
Viruses other than hepatitis associated with
aplastic anemia
Viruses other than the hepatitis viruses have also been
implicated as a causative agent of AA [1,5] which
include parvovirus B19 [19,30,31], Cytomegalovirus,
Epstein bar virus [19,31,32], Echovirus 3 [33], GB virus-
C [34], Transfusion Transmitted virus (TTV) [35], SEN
virus and non-A-E hepatitis virus (unknown viruses) [7].
Parvovirus B19, an under recognized hepatotrophic
virus, is documented as an offending agent of HAAA.
Its infection cause hepatic manifestation ranging from
abnormal liver functioning to Fulminant Hepatic failure
and aplastic anemia [30]. The primary site of infection
of this virus is erythroid progenitor cell in which it halts
the erythropoises and leads to the anemia in immuno-
compromised hosts. The DNA of this virus has been
detected in liver of fulminant hepatic failure manifested
with bone marrow aplapsia and in the serum of fulmi-
nant hepatitis children of unknown origin [36,37].
Association of Torque Teno virus, single stranded cir-
cular DNA has liver as a susceptible host as well as var-
ious other tissues including bone marrow. It has been
firstly reported in 12 years old Japanese boy suffered
from cytopenia following acute hepatitis by detecting
Torque Teno virus DNA of genotype 1a and IgM anti-
bodies against this virus in peripheral blood and bone
marrow mononuclear cells which precludes that acute
bone marrow failure majorly concerns with infection of
TTV virus to haemopoietic progenitor cells. However,
other studies have also been done on assessing the TTV
as an etiological agent of HAAA [33,38].
In a study a 6-year-old boy was experienced aplastic
anemia two months after the onset of acute hepatitis
associated with echovirus-3 [33]. As idiopathic aplastic
anemia is associated with the increased level of secretion
of INF-g and TNF-a from T cells which inhibit the
hematopoietic cell proliferation [39], similar increased
level of serum INF-g and TNF-a was found in the
patient four weeks after the onset of aplastic anemia
[33]. Similarly varying degrees of cytopenia has been
related to the HIV infection and severe aplastic anemic
conditions develop after subsequent attack of HSV-6
[17,40].
Epstein Bar virus infection, involved in hepatitis, mani-
fests the pathogenesis of marrow aplasia [40]. The
pathogenic mechanism involve in the EBV infection is
direct cytotoxity or mediates the immune response of
host [7,17,14,41].
Immunopathogenesis of HAAA
Aplastic anemia can be acquired or congenital [1,42]. As
the aplastic anemia following the hepatitis has been eluci-
dated as a severe bone marrow failure with an episode of
acute hepatitis, following lymphocyte variations occur
during the course of the syndrome: activation of circulat-
ing cytotoxic T cells increase, tend to accumulate in the
liver, broad skewing patter of T cell reportrie in periph-
eral blood of the patient forms, a large number of T cell
infiltration from liver parenchyma occurs [13,26,43,44]

defective monocyte to macrophage differentiation [45]
and decreased circulating level of interleukin-1 occur
[46].
Various Immunological abnormalities have been
accountable for the development of aplastic anemia fol-
lowing hepatitis. The immunological abnormalities with
HAAA show that CD8+ kupffer cells detecting by liver
biopsies appear as a mediator of this syndrome. In a
study it has been reported that patient showed a
decreased ratio of CD4/CD8 cells and a high percentage
of CD8 cells which can be cytotoxic and myleopoietic
during the in vitro study of aplastic anemia [10,20]. The
residing of CD8 cells in bone marrow during HAAA
produces a high level of interferon gamma (INF-g) and
cells derived from bone marrow locating in liver may
activate these cytotoxic T cells causing their intrahepatic
accumulation strongly affected by the Tumor necrosis
factor alpha (TNF-a) and interferon gamma (INF-g)
causing the onlooker damage to liver cell of genetically
modified mouse model. However, it has also been
shown in several studies that increased level of soluble
IL-2 receptor forms the major reason of non specific
inflammation of HAAA [47,48]. The pathogenesis of
HAAA in children has been suggested to relate with the
interruption in balance of lymphocyte sub-populations
and T lymphocyte activation [49].
Genetic Vulnerability of HAAA
Being an acquired disease, severe HAAA has also been
presented as a Familial Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome
(FBMFS) in a study while finding the family donor of
HSCs transplant for treatment of idiopathic fulminant
liver failure patient who has developed myelodysplastic
syndrome after onset of severe aplastic anemia. The
donor sibling also found to be developed the acute lym-
phoblastic leukemia after diagnosing the hypocelluarity
of bone marrow. The event of finding these two familial
cases shows the bone marrow failure syndrome to be
inherited [50].
HAAA has not been clarified with any genetic ten-
dency [18]. Mutation in genes of the telomere repair
complex, TERC (the gene for the RNA component of
telomerase) and TERT (the gene for the telomerase
reverse transcriptase catalytic enzyme), reduce the mar-
row regenerative capacity, making genes mutation car-
riers susceptible to the development of aplastic anemia
once it has been started [42].
Clinical features
Most of the clinical features relating to aplastic anemia
following the hepatitis include: Pallor and multiple skin
bleeding [11], lymphocytopenia, hypogammaglobulin
[51] low number of CD8/T cell ratio [12] and increased
number of cytotoxic cells [48] Neutropenia, fever [17].
Bacterial and fungal infection may emerge as secondary
in presenting the disease [2]. Later complications may
develop especially involving myelodysplasia [4]. The vic-
tims of severe aplastic anemia following the hepatitis
experience a severe immune deficiency that might be
either due to the hepatitis or aplastic anemia that is yet
to be discovered [51].
Diagnosis of hepatitis associated aplastic anemia
On a course of HAAA, hepatitis can be detected on
some of the following parameters: subsequent increase
in serum Alanine Trasnaminase (ALT), Aspartate Trans-
aminase (AST), by at least three times above the normal
values which are 6 to 41U/l, 9-34U/l, 5-58U/L for ALT
and AST respectively [12,18,30,35,36,43,52,53], increase
in serum Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutaryl
transferase (GGT) and billirubin (39-117U/l, 5-58 U/l,
and 2-7 micromol/L, respectively). Peripheral blood
count can be determined by Flow cytometry analysis
with directly conjugated monoclonal antibodies for CD2,
CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19 and HLA-DR, whereas haemato-
poietic failure with bone marrow hypocellularity can be
elucidated in terms of absolute neutrophil count (less
than 500 per mm3
), Platelet count (less than 20,000 per
mm3), Reticulocyte count (less than 60,000 per mm3
)
[53] and Protrombin Index (%): normal value 70-100%
[24]. To establish the onset of pancytopenia following
hepatitis, hypocelluarity of bone marrow below 50%
might be obtained by bone marrow aspiration [14] and
trephine biopsy [11].
Various virological and serological markers are avail-
able for the detection of hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, G, TTV
and parvovirus. Among these tests, anti-HAV Ig total
antibodies, HBsAg, HB core antigen, HBsIgG antibodies,
various HCV recombinant antigens and hepatitis E virus
IgM and IgG are being in use. However, to determine
causative nature of all hepatitis viruses, RNA genome of
RNA containing viruses such as HCV, HDV, HEV and
HGV can be qualitatively detected by RT-PCR reaction
and DNA of parvovirus B19 and TTV can be detected
by Nested PCR [14,53]. IgG antibody for Cytomegalo-
virus, EBV and parvovirus has been found a useful tool
for the diagnostic purposes [18]. However, serological
and virological parameters for hepatitis A, B, and C
were found negative in majority of the HAAA cases
reported in several studies [17,23,27].
Treatment
The standard therapy which is employed for the treat-
ment of HAAA is allogenic bone marrow (BM) trans-
plantation treatment from HLA matched siblings
[13,54]. HAAA is mostly occurring in children and it
would be easier to find the HLA matched donor. As
HAAA shows poor prognosis, most often it has been

treated by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
[26,55]. Immunosuppressive therapy has proved effective
after BM transplantation. Various immunosuppressive
drugs named Antithymocyte Globulin (ATG) and
Cyclosporine have been administered without eliciting
any acute side effects. Steroids such as Glucocorticoids
have also been employed in combination with immuno-
suppressive medications for the treatment of the HAA
patients [26]. A durable remission from HAA has been
achieved by the administrating high dose of Cyclopho-
sphamide (CY), a highly immunosuppressive, which eli-
cits its effect by readily destroying the lymphocytes and
committed myeloid cells. The haemopoietic stem cells
are not susceptible to the toxic effects of the CY due to
releasing the aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme which
inactivates the drug. However, restoration of haemato-
poesis process may achieved by high dose of CY which
mediates autoimmune attack on haematopoiectic stem
cells HSCs [13].
Patients irresponsive to the IST are prone to be cured
by unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation [18].
Immunosuppressive therapy might have proved as a safe
and alternative treatment for HAAA after of bone mar-
row or haemotopoietic stem cell transplantation [55].
Several studies showed that Parvovius induced aplastic
anemia improves by the administration of retroviral
therapy [21,56]. Antiviral therapy for treating hepatitis B
associated HAAA has been unknown yet; however it has
been tested by administrating the nucleoside analogs,
lamiviudine, against the aplastic anemic secondary to
hepatitis B virus infection and remission occurs from
the severe aplastic anemia accompanied with the hepati-
tis B viral infection. Interferon, an effective therapy for
the hepatitis B and C viral infections, cannot be
employed as a potential approach for the HAAA
because of its mylosuppressive effects [21]. Acyclovir
has been used for the treatment of aplastic anemia
caused by the Epstein Bar virus [32]. The blood count
comes to the normal range after five years of treatment
[55], however, chances of recovery from hepatitis asso-
ciated acquired aplastic anemia is rare [57].
Growth factors deficiencies have been found to be
responsible for the majority of the aplastic anemic cases
[1]. As these growth factors released by stromal cells are
essential for the survival, proliferation and differentiation
of hematopoietic stem cells [58,59], a transient increase
in granulocytes has been found effective in most aplastic
anaemic trials by administrating the erythropoietin,
growth factors, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor,
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, inter-
leukin-3 [1] and androgens [5].
The limiting factors in success of immunosuppressive
therapy are found to be the extent to which organ has
been destructed, tissue regeneration capacity and most
importantly pharmacology effect of drugs that is not suf-
ficient for uncontrolled potent immune response [1].
The survival of the patients treated with hematopoietic
cell transplantation and response rate to immunosup-
pressive therapy found to be 85% and 70% respectively
[7]. Children response better than the adults to bone
marrow transplantation and survival rate with Bone
marrow transplantation from HLA matched donors is
found to be similar as that for the non hepatitis asso-
ciated aplastic anemia [14].
It has also been reported that parameters of liver dys-
functioning tend to improve when pancytopenia starts
presenting itself [18,28]. Although majority of the
patients survives after aplastic anaemia tends to have
complete recovery, the mortality rate is yet very high
[52]. The mean survival rate after developing the severe
bone marrow aplasia has been 2 months and fatality
rate ranges from 78-88% [28,60,61].
Conclusion
HAAA is a well documented and diverse variant of clin-
ical syndrome of aplastic anemia, in which an acute
attack of hepatitis leads to the marrow failure and pan-
cytopenia that may be acute or chronic. This disorder
has been reported in 2-5% cases in West, 4-10% in Far
East and high in area of low socioeconomic status.
HAAA is not related to age, sex and severity of hepati-
tis, predominantly it has been found in children, adole-
secent boys and in young aged men. A number of
hepatitis viruses manifest the disease symptoms.
Amongst the hepatitis viruses, HBV, HCV and HGV
seropositivity has been mostly commonly observed in
reported cases of HAAA. The causative agent of HAAA
can be detected using hematological, biochemical,
immunological and virological markers. The clinical fea-
tures relating to HAAA are pallor and multiple skin
bleeding, lymphocytopenia, hypogammaglobulin, low
number of CD8/T cell ratio and increased number of
cytotoxic cells, neutropenia and fever etc. For HAAA,
immunosuppressive therapy is more effective after BM
transplantation.
