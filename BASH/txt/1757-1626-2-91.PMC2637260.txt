Abstract
Background: Brucellosis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients living in areas
that are endemic for the infection.
Case Presentation: A 20 years old Saudi male was diagnosed to have severe aplastic anemia at
King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh in April 2006. One hundred and
twelve days following his successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, he presented
with pyrexia in addition to neutropenia and mild thrombocytopenia. Brucella serology was strongly
positive and blood cultures grew Brucella melitensis. The bacteremic episode of brucellosis was
successfully treated with streptomycin, doxycyclin and ciprofloxacin at the outpatient clinic. To our
knowledge, this is the first case of a naturally occurring Brucella infection complicated by Brucella
bacteremia in a recipient of hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
Conclusion: Brucellosis may cause systemic infections, complicated bacteremias and serious
morbidity in immunocompromised patients living in countries that are endemic for the infection. It
should be considered as a possible cause of fever and pancytopenia in hematopoietic stem cell
transplant recipients living in these geographical locations. Nevertheless, the infection is curable
provided the diagnosis is made early and an appropriate antimicrobial therapy is promptly initiated.
Background
Aplastic anemia (AA) was first described by Paul Enrlich
in 1888 as hematopoiesis failure manifested by panytope-
nia and a fatty or an empty bone marrow. It can be effec-
tively treated by either hematopoietic stem cell transplant
(HSCT) or immunosuppressive therapy [1]. Antithymo-
cyte globulin and cyclosporine-A can restore hematopoie-
sis in approximately two thirds of patients, but the
recovery of the blood counts is often incomplete leading
to: recurrent pancytopenia that requires re-treatment and
certain late complications such as myelodysplastic syn-
drome. HSCT is usually a curative modality of therapy but
is best used for younger patients who have histocompati-
ble sibling donors [1].
Brucellosis, the commonest zoonotic infection in the
world, can affect healthy individuals as well as immuno-
compromised hosts living in endemic areas [2-4]. Brucel-

losis and Brucella bacteremia (BB) have a wide range of
clinical manifestations and complications may develop in
case of delay in the diagnosis or in the institution of
appropriate antimicrobial treatment [2,4-8]. Despite the
seriousness of this infection in some instances, almost all
the clinical manifestations and the laboratory abnormali-
ties are reversible provided the diagnosis is established
early and the appropriate antibiotic therapy is rapidly
administered [4,5,7,8].
Case presentation
A 20 year old Saudi male was diagnosed to have severe
acquired AA at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and
Research Centre (KFSH&RC) in Riyadh on 9/4/2006. He
presented with 2 week history of low grade pyrexia,
mucosal bleeding and anemic symptoms and his physical
examination revelaed: pallor, few ecchymotic areas over
the limbs, no external lymphadenopathy, a clear chest, no
palpable abdominal organomegaly, and normal cardio-
vascular and neurological systems. Complete blood count
(CBC) showed: WBC: 1.5 × 109/L with neutrophils of
0.02, Hb: 72 g/L and PLT: 5 × 109/L. Blood film revealed
severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia but no blast
cells and bone marrow biopsy showed a hypocellular
marrow with no blasts and a normal cytogenetic analysis.
Renal, hepatic and coagulation profiles were normal.
Screens for fanconi anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemo-
globinuria, hepatitis, brucellosis, syphilis, viruses and
autoimmune disorders were all negative. The patient was
given supportive measures and after identifying an HLA
identical and a healthy sibling donor, prepartions for all-
ogeneic HSCT were made. The transplant conditioning
was composed of fludarabine and cyclophophamide. The
patient received acyclovir, fluconazole and trimethoprim-
sulphamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) as infection prophylaxis
and cyclosporine-A and methotrexate as graft versus host
disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. On 15/5/2006, the patient
was given his allograft without any complication. The
patient developed: grade I mucositis treated with IV mor-
phine infusion and few febrile neutropenic episodes
treated empirically with vancomycin, cefepime, ampho-
tericin-B and metronidazole. However, no acute GVHD,
cytomegalovirus infection, venoocclusive disease of the
liver or hemorrhagic cystitis were encountered. The
patient engrafted his leucocytes on day +24 and his plate-
lets on day +16 HSCT. After the recovery of his blood
counts, the patient was discharged on zantac,
cyclosporine-A and prophylactic antimicrobials.
On 4/9/2006, he presented with 2 week history of high
grade pyrexia, rigors and sweating. He denied intake of
raw milk. Physical examination did not reveal any abnor-
mality. CBC showed: WBC: 2.37 × 109/L with neutrophils
of 1.59, Hb: 152 g/L and PLT: 97 × 109/L. Serum creati-
nine was 130 μmol/l [normal range: 0–122 μmole/L],
bilirubin 30 μmol/L [normal range: 0–22 μmole/L], ALT:
194 U/L [normal range: 0–50 U/L], AST: 176 U/L [normal
range: 0–40 U/L]. Blood cultures grew Brucella melitensis
sensitive to: TMP/SMZ, streptomycin, tetracyclin, cipro-
floxacin and imipenem. Brucella serology was strongly
positive with 2-mercaptoethanol titer of 1:1280 and
agglutination antibody titer of 1:20480. Initially, the
patient was given streptomycin 1 gram intramuscularly
twice daily and ciprofloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily for
two weeks. Few days later, the clinical manifestation of
brucellosis disappeared then the blood counts started to
recover so streptomycin was replaced by doxycyline 100
mg orally twice daily and the patient was continued on
ciprofloxacin for 4 more weeks. Subsequently, the blood
cultures for Brucella became negative, the Brucella titers
decreased significantly, the blood indices as well as the
renal and the hepatic profiles normalized. When the
patient was last seen on 29/4/2008, he was asymptomatic
and his physical examination did not reveal any abnor-
mality. CBC showed: WBC: 6.13 × 109/L with neutrophi-
lis of 2.82, Hb: 142 g/L and PLT: 186 × 109/L. The renal
and the hepatic profiles were normal. No new medication
was prescribed and the patient was given a new follow up
appointment.
Discussion
Brucellae are Gram-negative strictly aerobic, nonmotile
and nonencapsulated coccobacilli that can be isolated
from the genitourinary tracts of several domestic and wild
animals including: cows, goats, sheep, pigs and dogs [2].
Brucella abortus (B. abortus), B. suis, B. canis and B.
melitensis are human pathogens that can cause systemic
infections which may affect any organ system in the body
thus resulting in a wide spectrum of clinical manifesta-
tions [2,7,9,10]. The epidemiology of human brucellosis
has dramatically changed over the past 10 years due to
various sanitary, socioeconomic and political factors.
New foci of infection have emerged in Asia and the Near
East while several traditionally endemic areas in Europe
and South America have achieved control of the disease.
Unfortunately, the disease is still present in some parts of
Europe and the USA [3]. Direct contact with infected ani-
mals in addition to ingestion of unpasteurized milk and
dairy products are the main routes of transmission of
infection [2,11]. Contaminated aerosols can also transmit
infection to abattoir workers, veterineans and laboratory
technicians [2]. However, blood transfusion and HSCT
are possible but very unusual means of transmission of
brucellosis. Donors and recipients of blood and HSCT,
living in areas that are endemic for the infection, should
be screened for brucellosis and if they develop clinical
manifestations suggestive of the infection, appropriate
screening including blood cultures and Brucella serology
should be done and anti-Brucella treatment should be
administered without delay [11,12].

Brucellosis can cause a variety of clinical manifestations
that include: fever, rigors, sweating, anorexia, malaise,
weight loss, backache, bony pains, arthritis and arthralgias
and hepatosplenomegaly [2,4-10,13]. Up to 90% of
patients infected with Brucella develop BB. The great
majority of patients with BB have positive Brucella serol-
ogy with agglutination antibody titres of ≥ 1:320 [2,9].
Complications of BB include: infective endocarditis, fatal
endotoxic shock, severe microangiopathic hemolytic ane-
mia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), pan-
cytopenia, bleeding tendency, multiorgan failure and
death [9,10]. However, clinical improvement and nor-
malization of blood indices as well as coagulation profiles
may follow early administration of appropriate antimi-
crobial therapy [9,10,13].
Brucellosis is a leading infectious cause of pyrexia of
unknown origin (PUO) in some parts of the world [4].
Brucella infections have been reported in patients with
acute leukemia or solid tumors. Due to its slow growth in
blood cultures and due to the late appearance of the clin-
ical manifestations of Brucella infection, failure of empir-
ical antibiotic therapy may be encountered in patients
with febrile neutropenia. Therefore, brucellosis should be
considered as a possible cause of febrile neutropenia and
pancytopenia in immunocompromised hosts living in
endemic areas [4,13].
Brucellosis may lead to various changes in hematological
abnormalities eg anemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia
and panytopenia in addition to bleeding disorders [5-8].
Anemia is the most frequently encountered abnormality
and may occasionally be hemolytic in nature. The leuco-
cytic count is usually depressed with predominant affec-
tion of neutrophils and lymphocytes [5,6]. The possible
mechanisms involved in Brucella-induced thrombocyto-
penia are: immune destruction of platelets, reactive hemo-
phagocytosis and hypersplenism [8]. DIC may also be
seen in patients with severe infection [10]. The vast major-
ity of patients with pancytopenia-induced by Brucella
infection have positive blood cultures for the organism
and almost all of these patients have positive Brucella
serology with agglutination titres of ≥ 1:320 [2,7,9]. The
bone marrow changes seen in patients with brucellosis are
very variable and may include: hypercellular or nomocel-
lular marrows, hemophagocytosis, granulomatous
lesions, changes consistent with hypersplenism, reduced
iron stores, abundant megakaryocytes in case of Brucella-
induced thrombocytopenia and rarely pure red cell apla-
sia [5-8]. However, all the changes in the hematological
parameters encountered in patients with brucellosis are
often transient and reversible provided an appropriate
antimicrobial therapy is initiated promptly [5,7,8,13].
Demonstration of high or rising antibody titers to Brucella
antigen can make a presumptive diagnosis of brucellosis,
but the infection can only be confirmed by culture of the
organism from blood, bone marrow or other tissues. Bru-
cella bacilli survive the intracellular killing by phagocytes
and polymorphonuclear leucocytes and localize in the
reticuloendothelial system thus leading to suboptimal
recovery rate of the organism from blood, bone marrow,
liver tissue or lymph nodes [2]. The use of aerobic bottles
of the automated continuous-monitoring blood culture
system, eg., BACTEC 9000 and BACTEC 9240 makes pos-
sible the diagnosis in more than 95% of positive blood
cultures within 7 days thus obviating the need to perform
subcultures of the negative media [2,14]. The Brucella
ELISA test is a reliable and sensitive test in the diagnosis of
brucellosis. It is rapid, easy to perform and can be auto-
mated [15].
The following antimicrobials have been employed in the
treatment of brucellosis: TMP/SMZ, rifampicin, doxycy-
cline, gentamycin and streptomycin [4,9,10,12]. The in-
vitro resistance to TMP/SMZ is approximately 29%, but
the overall rate of clinical relapse is about 5%. In uncom-
plicated cases of brucellosis, treatment for 6 weeks is usu-
ally sufficient, but the duration of therapy may be
extended up to 3 months in case of complications such as
spinal involvement or infective endocarditis [9].
The patient presented developed BB after having a success-
ful allograft for his AA whilst having normal blood counts
and being off all the transplant-related immunosuppres-
sive medications. After acquiring the BB, his blood counts
decreased significantly and the hepatic profile became
impaired but his Brucella antibody titers were strikingly
elevated reflecting his ability to mount a rather brisk
immunologic response to the infection despite his
reduced immunity. However, he responded very well to
the treatment given and his blood indices and liver func-
tion tests reverted to normal levels after the control of the
Brucella sepsis.
Conclusion
Brucellosis can affect immunocompromised hosts as well
as healthy individuals. Even recipients of various forms of
HSCT can acquire this infection even after the recovery of
their blood counts and after stopping their immunosup-
pressive therapy. Brucellosis should always be included in
the differential diagnosis of febrile neutropenia and pan-
cytopenia in immunocompromised hosts living in geo-
graphic areas that are endemic for brucellosis. Specific
investigations including blood cultures for Brucella and
Brucella serology should be taken and appropriate antimi-
crobial therapy should be initiated promptly. Brucellosis
is curable and is usually responsive to antimicrobial ther-
