Abstract
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are a group of progressive, clonal, neoplastic bone marrow disorders characterized by
hematopoietic stem cell dysregulation and abnormalities in the immune system. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have
gained further interests after the demonstration of an immunoregulatory role. Nevertheless, the immunoregulatory function
of MDS bone marrow derived MSC (MDS-MSC) remains poorly defined. In addition, it is not clear whether there are
differences in the regulatory functions between low-risk and high-risk MDS-MSC. In this study, we obtain and expand MSC
from bone marrow of patients with MDS. Our results show that there are significant differences in the immunoregulatory
functions between low-risk and high-risk MDS-MSC. Compare to low-risk MDS-MSC, high-risk MDS-MSC is associated with
the presence of increased TGF-b1, higher apoptosis, higher immunosuppressive rate and a poor ability of hematopoietic
support. In addition, our results find that there are great differences in the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs inducible rate between
high-risk MDS-MSC and low-risk MDS-MSC. Compared to high-risk MDS-MSC, the inducible rate of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs
of low-risk MDS-MSC is lower. At last, we find that MDS-MSC derived TGF-b1 is largely responsible for the increase in
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs based on knockdown studies. These results elucidate the different immunoregulatory role of MSC
in low-risk and high-risk MDS, which may be important for understand the pathogenesis of MDS and the development of
novel immunomodulatory strategies for the treatment of MDS.

Introduction
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) comprise a heterogeneous
group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell malignancies character-
ized by ineffective bone marrow (BM) hematopoiesis, peripheral
blood cytopenias and substantial risk for progression to acute
myeloid leukemia. Several clinical and immunological studies
suggest a significant deregulation of the immune system in the
complex pathogenesis of MDS. This deregulation may even
promote the progression of early MDS to advanced MDS [1–2].
In addition, BM failure in partial early or low-risk MDS patients
has been considered to be related to the strong immunologic
function of T lymphocytes. Consistent with it, previous studies had
confirmed that immunosuppressive therapy with ATG or CSA
could lead to lasting hematologic responses and abrogation of T-
cell clones, which was particularly noticeable in low-risk MDS [3–
4].
Using the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), MDS
can be broadly separated into low-risk (IPSS score#1.0) and high-
risk (IPSS score.1.0), each with distinct pathology [5]. There are
several differences between low-risk and high-risk MDS. First,
compared to high-risk MDS, low-risk MDS have a good prognosis
and longer survival. Second, low-risk MDS is characterized by
increased apoptosis in the bone marrow with autoimmune
characteristics whereas the high-risk stages involve immune
evasion and cytogenetic abnormalities, giving cells growth
potential to progress into leukemia. At last, there are big
differences in the immune abnormalities between low-risk and
high-risk MDS. Compare to low-risk MDS, high-risk MDS is
associated with the presence of dysfunctional NK cells, increased
Tregs, increased cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, lower apoptosis and a
poor response to immunosuppressive therapy. All these differences
show that low-risk MDS and high-risk MDS possess different
biological characteristics [6].
As we all know, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have
immunomodulatory properties, exerted by cell-to-cell contact
and in a paracrine fashion [7–8]. Previous studies have shown
that MSC are inherently low of immunogenicity and are capable
of inhibiting T cells proliferation in vitro and mediate a systemic
immunosuppressive property in vivo [9–10]. In addition, MSC
represent an important cellular component in the bone marrow
microenvironment. This raised the question of whether MSC play
a certain role in the immune abnormalities and the pathogenesis of
MDS.
Our previous studies demonstrated that although MDS bone
marrow derived MSC (MDS-MSC) were similar to normal adult
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e45675
bone marrow derived MSC in morphology, growth property,
surface epitopes, and differentiation ability in vitro, the immuno-
regulatory functions of MDS-MSC were impaired, suggesting the
involvement of MSC in the pathogenesis of MDS [11]. In
addition, the different immune abnormalities between low-risk and
high-risk MDS prompted us to investigate whether there were
differences in the immunoregulatory functions between low-risk
and high-risk MDS-MSC. Moreover, it is unclear what is the
definitive role of MSC in the pathogenesis of MDS with different
phase.
The current study is designed to investigate the immunoregu-
latory functions of low-risk and high-risk MDS-MSC. Our data
show that there is a big difference in the immune abnormality
between low-risk and high-risk MDS-MSC. Compare to low-risk
MDS-MSC, high-risk MDS-MSC is associated with the presence
of increased Tregs, increased TGF-b1, higher apoptosis, higher
immunosuppressive rate and a poor ability of hematopoietic
support. In addition, our results demonstrate that MDS-MSC
derived TGF-b1 is largely responsible for the increase in
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs based on knockdown studies.
Materials and Methods
Patient Characteristics
Fourteen patients with low-risk MDS (aged from 38 to 56; IPSS
score#1.0) and fifteen patients with high-risk MDS (aged from 32
to 57; IPSS score.1.0) were investigated in this study; Ten healthy
donors (aged from 30 to 55) were also recruited. All patients were
in their initial diagnose and untreated at the time of study.
Diagnosis was established by BM aspirate smears, BM biopsy,
cytogenetic analyses and peripheral blood count criteria, accord-
ing to the WHO group.
Isolation and Culture of MSC
After receiving informed consent from the patients according to
the academic guidelines on the use of human subjects in research,
human bone marrow was obtained from patients and healthy
donors under the protocol approved by the institutional review
board. Mononuclear cells (MNC) were separated by a Ficoll-
Paque gradient centrifugation (specific gravity 1.077 g/ml; Sigma
Diagnostics, St Louis, MO, USA), and cultured in expansion
medium at 37uC with 5% CO2 in fully humidified atmosphere.
Expansion medium contained 60% DMEM/F-12 (Gibco Life
Technologies, Paisley, UK), 40% MCDB-201 (Sigma), 2% fetal
calf serum (FCS; Gibco), 16 insulin transferrin selenium, 1 6
linoleic acid bovine serum albumin, 1029
M dexamethasone
(sigma), 5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Gibco), 10 ng/
mL platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB; Sigma), 10 ng/
mL bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4; Sigma), 10 ng/mL
insulin like growth factor (IGF; Sigma), 100 U/mL penicillin,
1000 U/mL streptomycin (Gibco). After culture for 24–48 h, the
culture medium was replaced and non adherent cells were
removed. Once cells were more than 80% confluent, they were
detached with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Sigma), then CD14 positive
cells were depleted using CD14 micromagnetic beads (Miltenyi
Biotec, Auburn, USA).and CD14 negative cells were replated. To
ensure single cell originality of each cell colony, sorted cells were
plated at concentrations of 1 cells/well in 96 well plate coated by
fibronectin (Sigma) in each setting and cultured in expansion
medium. Wells with single adherent cell were identified during the
first 24 hours. The appearance of cell colonies was checked daily.
Single colony was harvested by trypsinization and expanded [12].
Preparation of T Cell Subsets
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC) from
healthy donors were isolated by centrifugation over Ficoll-
Hypaque gradients (Nycomed Amersham, Uppsala, Sweden).
CD4+ T lymphocytes were isolated from hPBMC by using CD4
micromagnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instruction. CD4+ cell purity was 97%
62%. Subsequently, CD4+CD25-T cells and CD4+CD25+T cells
were obtained by using the CD25 beads (Miltenyi Biotec).
Coculture Experiment
MSC (either normal-MSC or MDS-MSC or low-risk MDS-
MSC or high-risk MDS-MSC) and T cells (either CD4+CD25-T
cells or CD4+CD25+T cells) were cocultured at 1:1 ratio at 106
cells/mL in RPMI 1640 with 5% FCS.
FACS Analysis
For immunophenotype analysis, cultured cells were washed with
PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma), and
incubated with primary antibodies (10–20 ng/ml) for 30 minutes
at 4uC. Primary antibodies included mAb against CD4, CD25,
CD40, CD80, CD86 and Foxp3 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen,
San Diego, CA, USA). We used same-species, same-isotype
irrelevant antibody as negative control. Cell analysis was
performed with FACS Calibur system using Cellquest software.
Cytokine Analysis
Cytokines produced in culture supernatants at day 3 from MSC
were detected by using ELISA kits (R&D Systems) for interleukin
(IL)-3, IL-6, IL-11, transforming growth factor b1 (TGF-b1) and
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)1.
Mixed Leukocyte Reaction
Allogeneic CD2+ T cells were purified from hPBMC by using
the MACS CD2 isolation kit. CD2+T cells resuspended at 16105
to 16106
cells/well were added to wells containing or lacking
irradiated (15 Gy) allogeneic suppressive cells. The culture was
continued and 3H-thymidine was added 18 hours before the end
of the 120-hour culture. The T-cell proliferation was represented
as the incorporated radioactivity in cpm and shown as mean6SD
of triplicate values.
Effect of MSC on T Cell Apoptosis
MSC and MNC were prepared as described before. T cells
were cultured alone or cocultured with MSC with PHA (5 mg/ml)
stimulation for 3 days, then harvested and quantified, stained with
Annexin-V kit (BD,USA), and analyzed by flow cytometry.
TGF-b1 Knockdown in MSC
TGF-b1 siRNA duplexes were used to knock down this
respective gene in MSC. Briefly, MSC (106
) were seeded in 75-
cm2
flasks, after 24 h, 100 nM siRNA was delivered via
DharmaFECT Transfection Reagent (Dharmacon, USA). TGF-
b1 siRNA duplex sequence was selected as follows: 59-gca aca auu
ccu ggc gau a-39 and 59-uau cgc cag gaa uug uug c-39. All siRNA
duplexes were obtained from Takara Biotech (Dalian, China).
Knockdown of TGF-b1 was confirmed by western blot.
Western Blotting
For Western blotting, equivalent amount of protein lysates,
obtained from induced cells, were loaded per lane. After SDS-
PAGE, proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitro-
cellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Uppsala,

Sweden). After blocking, blots were incubated with mouse
polyclonal antibodies against TGF-b1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
at 1:200. Expression of the b-actin was used as an internal control.
Immunodetection using the enhanced chemiluminescence method
(ECL kit; Amersham, Piscataway, N.J.) was performed according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical Analysis
The results were statistically analyzed by using the SPSS11.0
statistical package (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). The Student t test for
paired data (2-tail) and ANOVA was used to test the probability of
significant differences between samples.
Results
Biological Characteristics of MDS-MSC
In this study, MSC were obtained from 14 low-risk MDS and
13 high-risk MDS patients’ bone marrow. We failed to isolate
adherent cells from two high-risk MDS patients. These patients,
aged 41 and 46 respectively, were all male at diagnosis of MDS-
RAEB-1. Eighty-four clones,came from twenty-seven different
patients, were obtained and analyzed for their immunoregulatory
characteristics. MSC derived from MDS and normal adult
displayed homogeneous fibroblast-like morphology. Two weeks
later, almost all obtained MSC formed colony-forming unit
fibroblast colonies (CFU-F). The frequency of CFU-F were
6.2461.21 (per 106
bone marrow mononuclear cells; n = 12) for
high-risk MDS-MSC, and 7.3960.85 (per 106
bone marrow
mononuclear cells; n = 14) for low-risk MDS-MSC, and
7.1660.62 (per 106
bone marrow mononuclear cells; n = 10) for
normal-MSC, respectively. In addition, previous studies demon-
strated that human MSC did not express costimulatory molecules
B7-1, B7-2, CD40, and CD40 ligand [13]. So, we examine the
immunophenotype of MDS-MSC. Our results demonstrated that
these cells were negative for the expression of CD80, CD86, CD40
and HLA-DR. The immunophenotype of MSC remained
unchanged during culture-expansion for at least 20 passages.
Cytokine Secreted by MDS-MSC
Previous studies demonstrated that MSC take part in the
regulation of immune by secreting various kinds of cytokines [8].
Using ELISA, our results showed that clonal MDS-MSC secreted
more IL-6 but less TGF-b1 and HGF, compared to normal-MSC.
The secretion of IL-3 and IL-11 was largely unchanged, as shown
in Figure 1. In addition, our results demonstrated that there were
great differences between high-risk MDS-MSC and low-risk
MDS-MSC in the secretion of cytokines. Compare to high-risk
MDS-MSC, low-risk MDS-MSC secreted decreased TGF-b1.
The secretion of other cytokines was almost unchanged between
high-risk MDS-MSC and low-risk MDS-MSC. Moreover, our
data found that the secretion of TGF-b1 was similar between high-
risk MDS-MSC and normal-MSC (Figure 1).
Effect of MSC on T Cell Apoptosis
To test whether MSC was involved in the regulation of T cells
apoptosis, T cells were analyzed for apoptosis after culture alone
or coculture with MSC. Our results showed that MSC could
significantly decrease the effect of activation-induced apoptosis of
T cells. By day 3, the percentage of apoptosis was 26.1861.98% of
T cells in cultures without MSC. However, when cocultured with
normal-MSC, the percentage of apoptotic T cells decreased to
16.3961.65%. In addition, when cocultured with MDS-MSC, the
percentage of apoptotic T cells further decreased to 9.4861.14%
(compared with co-culture system of normal-MSC, p,0.05). The
next examination was to test whether there were differences in the
regulation of T cells apoptosis between high-risk MDS-MSC and
low-risk MDS-MSC. The data demonstrated that high-risk MDS-
MSC exhibited lower inhibition effect on T cells apoptosis
(12.6561.37%) than low-risk MDS-MSC (6.9460.82%, p,0.05)
(Figure 2). This implies that there are great difference between
high-risk MDS-MSC and low-risk MDS-MSC in the inhibited
effect on activation-induced T cells apoptosis.
Inhibitory Effect of MDS-MSC on T Cell Proliferation
In this study, our results demonstrated that MDS-MSC could
obviously inhibit the proliferation of T cell stimulated by mitogen.
As shown in Figure 3, there was a significant reduction in T cell
proliferation when mixed culture of T cell stimulated by PHA was
performed in the presence of irradiated MSC (MSC/T-lympho-
cyte ratio was 1:10). However, the immunosuppressive rate of
MDS-MSC on T cell proliferation was obviously less than that of
normal-MSC (45.362.3% in MDS-MSC versus 77.564.8% in
normal derived MSC, p,0.05), suggesting that the immunosup-
pressive effects of MDS-MSC were impaired.
Given that high-risk MDS-MSC and low-risk MDS-MSC might
exist differences in immunoregulatory function, we examined the
immunoregulatory function of high-risk MDS-MSC and low-risk
MDS-MSC. We found that although both high-risk MDS-MSC
and low-risk MDS-MSC could obviously inhibit the proliferation
of T cell, the immunosuppressive rate of low-risk MDS-MSC on T
cell proliferation was obviously less than that of high-risk MDS-
MSC (24.961.8% in low-risk MDS-MSC versus 68.464.3% in
high-risk MDS-MSC, p,0.05). Moreover, the immunosuppressive
rate of high-risk MDS-MSC on PHA-induced T cell proliferation
was slightly lower than that of normal-MSC (68.464.3% in high-
risk MDS-MSC versus 77.564.8% in normal derived MSC), but
not statistically significant (p.0.05) (Figure 3).
MDS-MSC Induce CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs
T regulatory cells (Tregs) play an important role in the control
of immune reactivity against self-antigens and non-selfantigens
[14]. Previous studies had reported that MSC could expand
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs in vivo and in vitro [15–16]. In this
study, we cocultured MDS-MSC or normal-MSC with
CD4+CD25+T cells, and found that MDS-MSC or normal-
MSC could not expand CD4+CD25+T cells in vitro. we next
wanted to know whether MSC could generate
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs from CD4+CD25-Foxp3-T cells, we
cocultured MSC with CD4+CD25-T cells. The results showed
that both MDS-MSC and normal-MSC could efficiently generate
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs from CD4+CD25-T cells
(5.8%60.5% for T cell alone, 12.2%60.8% for MDS-MSC,
and 11.7%60.7% for normal-MSC) (Figure 4A). In addition, the
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs inducible rate of MDS-MSC was
slightly higher than that of normal-MSC, but not statistically
significant (p.0.05). Our results also demonstrated that both
MDS-MSC and normal-MSC induced CD4+CD25+Foxp3+-
Tregs were able to inhibit T-cell proliferation (Figure 4B).
Moreover, we found that the addition of MDS-MSC induced
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs or normal-MSC induced
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs to T-lymphocyte stimulated with
PHA suppressed the mitogenic response in a dose-dependent
fashion (Figure 4C). At last, our results found that there were great
differences in the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs inducible rate
between high-risk MDS-MSC and low-risk MDS-MSC. Com-
pared to high-risk MDS-MSC (13.8%60.9%), the inducible rate
of low-risk MDS-MSC (7.5%60.6%) was lower (Figure 4D).

Induction of Tregs by MDS-MSC is Dependent on TGFb1
Previous studies showed that TGF-b1 was important cytokine in
the induction of tolerance and Tregs [16–18]. Based on the data in
Figure 2A, we wanted to determine whether MDS-MSC or
normal-MSC derived TGF-b1 could induce
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs from CD4+CD25-Foxp3-T cells. In
this study, we performed knockdown of TGF-b1 in MDS-MSC or
normal-MSC before adding them to cocultures. Knockdown
MDS-MSC or normal-MSC were studied for TGF-b1 production.
Western blot showed nearly undetectable TGF-b1 in TGF-
b1siRNA-transfected MDS-MSC or normal-MSC (Figure 5A). In
addition, in the absence of TGF-b1 in MDS-MSC or normal-
MSC, there were no significant difference in the generation of
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs (6.2%60.5% for T cell alone,
5.3%60.3% for low-risk MDS-MSC, 5.9%60.4% for high-risk
MDS-MSC, and 4.7%60.8% for normal-MSC) (Figure 5B).
These results were the opposite with studies using untransfected
MDS-MSC or untransfected normal-MSC (Figure 4A) or mutant
siRNA, which showed a significant increase in the generation of
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs. Moreover, anti-rhTGF-b1 was added
in cocultures of CD4+CD25-T cells and untransfected MDS-MSC
or normal-MSC. We found that there were no significant
difference in the generation of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs
(4.6%60.6% for T cell alone, 5.5%60.6% for low-risk MDS-
MSC, 7.1%60.5% for high-risk MDS-MSC, and 4.9%60.6% for
normal-MSC) (Figure 5C). These results indicate a significant role
for TGF-b1 secreted by MDS-MSC or normal-MSC in the
generation of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs.
Discussion
The pathophysiology of MDS involves both intrinsic (cytoge-
netic, epigenetic) and extrinsic (extracellular, microenvironment)
factors. For one thing, the etiology of MDS is presumed that
targeted injury or mutation within hematopoietic progenitor cells
(intrinsic abnormality) is an early, initiating event in a multistep
pathogenesis; For the other, several defects in the bone marrow
microenvironment that contribute to the pathogenesis of MDS
include the aberrant secretion of angiogenic cytokines by
monocyte and stromal cells (or MSC), and the aberrant
immunoregulatory functions of MSC.
In addition, current knowledge indicates that aberrant immune
responses and T-cell-mediated inhibition of hematopoiesis have
been associated with the pathophysiology of MDS. In addition,
previous studies have shown that MSC are capable of inhibiting T
cells proliferation in vitro and mediate a systemic immunosuppres-
sive property in vivo [7–10]. However, the definitive immunoreg-
ulatory function of MDS-MSC and the role of MDS-MSC in the
pathogenesis of the disease are extremely limited. For this reason,
the investigation of MDS-MSC not only help us to further
elucidate etiology and pathology of MDS, but also help us to find
new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of MDS.
Previous studies on the immunoregulatory function of MDS-
MSC have been controversial [11,19–20]. Klous et al found that
MDS patient-derived MSC were capable to sufficiently inhibit T
cell proliferation in vitro induced by PHA or IL-2 [19]. However,
Han et al demonstrated that the immunomodulatory ability of
MDS-MSC, compared to MSC from healthy volunteers, was
impaired, which might be a cause for an abnormal hematopoietic
environment [20]. Consistent with the results of Han’s study, our
previous study also found that MDS-MSC showed reduced
hematopoiesis support function, as compared to their normal
countparts. In addition, the capacity of MDS-MSC to inhibit T
lymphocyte activation and proliferation was impaired in vitro [11].
Because low-risk MDS and high-risk MDS possess different
biological characteristics, including the immunoregulatory func-
tions, we wonder whether there are differences in the immuno-
regulatory functions between low-risk and high-risk MDS-MSC.
In addition, we found that the immunoregulatory functions were
investigated in MSC not only derived from low-risk MDS, but also
Figure 3. MDS-MSC inhibit T-lymphocyte proliferation. Irradiated (15 Gy) MDS-MSC or normal-MSC were cultured for 5 days with CD2+ T-
lymphocyte in the presence of PHA, then assessed by [3H]-thymidine incorporation. Data are expressed as mean6SD of triplicates of 5 separate
experiments. *P#0.05.

derived from high-risk MDS in Klaous’s study [19]. But, in our
and Han’s studies, only low-risk MDS-MSC was investigated for
their immunoregulatory functions [11,20]. So, we hypothesize that
the reason of those controversial results is that there are differences
in the immunoregulatory functions between low-risk and high-risk
MDS-MSC. Moreover, in previous studies, MSC have been
analyzed as a complex network of different cell types and
molecules, thus it has been difficult to identify and characterize
the cell types that are altered in MDS. In order to address these
issues, in the present study, we investigate the functional properties
of MSC derived from high-risk and low-risk MDS at single cell
level.
In this study, MDS-MSC displayed abnormal immunomodu-
latory function not only in inhibiting activation-induced apoptosis
of T cells, but also in inhibiting the proliferation of T cell. In
addition, there were several differences between low-risk and high-
risk MDS derived MSC. Firstly, our data demonstrated that high-
risk MDS-MSC exhibited lower inhibition effect on T cells
apoptosis than that of low-risk MDS-MSC; Secondly, we found
that the immunosuppressive rate of low-risk MDS-MSC on T-cell
proliferation was obviously less than that of high-risk MDS-MSC
(24.961.8% in low-risk MDS-MSC versus 68.464.3% in high-risk
MDS-MSC, p,0.05); Thirdly, our results demonstrated that there
were great differences between high-risk MDS-MSC and low-risk
MDS-MSC in the secretion of cytokines. Analysis of cytokine
profiles revealed that high-risk MDS-MSC secreted TGF-b1 at a
higher levels than low-risk MDS-MSC; Lastly, the ability of
hematopoietic support of high-risk MDS-MSC was significantly
less than that of low-risk MDS-MSC (Data not shown). All these
results imply that there are great difference between high-risk
MDS-MSC and low-risk MDS-MSC in the immunoregulatory
functions.
Previous studies demonstrated that the immunomodulatory
ability of aplastic anemia (AA) derived MSC, compared to MSC
from healthy volunteers, was impaired, which might be a cause for
an abnormal hematopoietic environment [21]. Similar to AA,
abnormality in the immune system is one characteristic of MDS.
Immune mechanisms contribute to the cytopenias of MDS by
adversely affecting progenitor survival [22]. In a subset of patients
with MDS, laboratory data have shown that myelosuppression is
mediated by T lymphocytes [23–24]. In this study, although
MDS-MSC could significantly decrease the effect of activation-
induced apoptosis of T cells, MDS-MSC exhibited lower
inhibition effect on T cells apoptosis than that of normal-MSC,
implying an overactivated immune reaction in MDS. Moreover,
immunomodulatory agents, such as thalidomide, lenalidomide,

CSA and ATG, are clinically effective for some MDS cases [3–4].
Based on this evidence, normal derived MSC transplantation
might be an effective treatment for MDS by utilizing MSC to
modulate immune reactions and improve the bone marrow
microenvironment.
Tregs maintain immunologic self-tolerance and also suppress
immune responses to tumors, transplants, and infectious agents.
Previous studies has clearly established that Tregs are increased in
human solid tumors as well as hematologic malignancies [25]. In
addition, Kordasti et al demonstrate a significant increase in the
number of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs in high-risk MDS [26].
However, little is known about the mechanisms leading to this
increase. In this study, our results showed that both MDS-MSC
and normal-MSC could efficiently generate

CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs from CD4+CD25-T cells. Our finding
might be one possible mechanism responsible for expansion of
Treg cells in MDS patients. Although Patel et al [27] found that
MSC derived from normal adult could efficiently generate
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs from CD4+CD25-Foxp3-T cells, it
was unclear whether this characteristic of MSC were altered in
diseased states. In this study, we found that there was a big
difference between normal-MSC and MDS-MSC in the role of
generation of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs. Our result showed that
the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs inducible rate were significantly
higher in high-risk MDS-MSC compared with normal-MSC and
in normal-MSC compared with low-risk MDS-MSC and in high-
risk MDS-MSC compared with low-risk MDS-MSC. Moreo-
ver,CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Treg cells induced by MDS-MSC
were functional and able to suppress T-cell responses. These
results suggest that high-risk MDS-MSC may inhibit effective
immune responses against the dysplastic clone by inducing
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs, thereby facilitating disease progres-
sion. Moreover, low numbers of Tregs induced by low-risk MDS-
MSC may permit the emergence of autoreactive T-cell clones and
secondary bone marrow hypoplasia.
TGF-b1 is a protein that controls proliferation, cellular
differentiation, and other functions in most cells [28–29]. TGF-
b1 also plays a role in immunity and cancer [30–32]. Our previous
studies demonstrated that MSC could inhibit T cell proliferation
by secreting TGF-b1 [33]. Previous studies also demonstrated that
TGF-b1 has been linked to the expansion of Tregs [15–16]. In
addition, Patel et al demonstrated that MSC derived TGF-b1
could expand CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs [27]. Consistent with
this, our results showed that T-lymphocyte proliferation sup-
pressed by MDS-MSC could be restored by high dose of anti-
rhTGF-b1 ($0.5 mg/mL), indicating the inhibitory effects of
MDS-MSC were mediated by soluble factor of TGF-b1.
Moreover, our results indicate a significant role for TGF-b1
secreted by MDS-MSC or normal-MSC in the generation of
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs based on knockdown studies.
To date, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells transplantation
(allo-HSCT) is still the most effective treatment for MSD. Previous
studies demonstrated that MSC in allo-HSCT recipients were
damaged and remain of host origin [34]. Therefore, the impaired
immunoregulatory and hematopoietic support functions of MDS-
MSC may decrease the effectiveness of the therapy of allo-HSCT.
Instead, cotransplantation of hematopoietic stem cells and
cultured MSC might be a better option to treat MDS patients.
Furthermore, our results demonstrated the different immunoreg-
ulatory role of MSC in low-risk and high-risk MDS, which may be
important for understand the pathogenesis of MDS and the
development of novel immunomodulatory strategies for the
treatment of MDS. For example, the reduced Tregs frequencies
observed in low-risk disease may contribute to the immune-
mediated apoptosis. Therefore, cellular therapy based on adoptive
transfer of ex vivo expanded Tregs is a potential strategy to treat
autoimmune characteristics in low-risk MDS.
Several previous studies suggest a significant deregulation of the
immune system in the complex pathogenesis of MDS [1–2]. This
deregulation may even promote the progression of early MDS to
advanced MDS. Previous studies also found that different immune
cells, such as DCs, Tregs, NK/T cells, Th17 and cytotoxic CD8+
T cells, were significantly aberrant in patients with MDS [6]. MSC
have also been shown to exert a potent suppression on both innate
and adaptive immunity by acting on NK and B lymphocytes and
DCs and Tregs. In this study, we only demonstrated the different
immunoregulatory role of MSC in low-risk and high-risk MDS on
T lymphocytes. The next test, focusing on the effect of MDS-MSC
on onther immune cells, such as DCs, Tregs, NK/T cells and so
on, is necessary.
In conclusion, we investigate for the first time the immunoreg-
ulatory functions of MSC in both low- and high-risk MDS at single
cell level. Our data demonstrate that there is a big difference in the
immune abnormality between low-risk and high-risk MDS-MSC.
Compare to low-risk MDS-MSC, high-risk MDS-MSC is associ-
ated with the presence of increased Tregs, increased TGF-b1,
higher apoptosis, higher immunosuppressive rate and a poor
ability of hematopoietic support. In addition, our results demon-
strate that MDS-MSC derived TGF-b1 is largely responsible for
the increase in CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs based on knockdown
studies. Knowing the different immunoregulatory functions
between low- and high-risk MDS-MSC may be important for
reasonable MSC selection in stem cell based therapy. As a
corollary, this would allow an improved exploitation of MSC in
other diseases with immune abnormalities.
