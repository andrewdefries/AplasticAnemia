Benzene toxicity involves both bone marrow depression and leukemogenesis caused by damage
to multiple classes of hematopoietic cells and a variety of hematopoietic cell functions. Study of
the relationship between the metabolism and toxicity of benzene indicates that several
metabolites of benzene play significant roles in generating benzene toxicity. Benzene is
metabolized, primarily in the liver, to a variety of hydroxylated and ring-opened products that are
transported to the bone marrow where subsequent secondary metabolism occurs. Two potential
mechanisms by which benzene metabolites may damage cellular macromolecules to induce
toxicity include the covalent binding of reactive metabolites of benzene and the capacity of
benzene metabolites to induce oxidative damage. Although the relative contributions of each of
these mechanisms to toxicity remains unestablished, it is clear that different mechanisms
contribute to the toxicities associated with different metabolites. As a corollary, it is unlikely that
benzene toxicity can be described as the result of the interaction of a single metabolite with a
single biological target. Continued investigation of the metabolism of benzene and its metabolites
will allow us to determine the specific combination of metabolites as well as the biological
target(s) involved in toxicity and will ultimately lead to our understanding of the relationship
between the production of benzene metabolites and bone marrow toxicity. Environ Health

Introduction
The identification of benzene metabolites
and their quantification began in the 19th
century. However, it was not until carbon-
14 was available for the synthesis of
[14C]benzene that it was possible to perform
accurate measurements and to be sure that
all the stable metabolites could be detected.
Thus, in 1953 Parke and Williams (1)
reported that upon administering [14C]ben-
zene to rabbits they could recover 32.6% of
the dose in urine as phenol, catechol,
hydroquinone, 1,2,4-benzenetriol, trans-
trans-muconic acid, and L-phenylmercap-
turic acid, 44.5% in the expired air as

unchanged benzene and small amounts of
carbon dioxide, and 5 to 10% in the feces
and tissues. Their total recovery was
approximately 84 to 89%. They went on to
suggest that benzene toxicity, i.e., benzene-
induced bone marrow depression, might be
caused by some ofthese metabolites.
Review of Benzene Toxicity
A discussion of the role ofbenzene metabo-
lites in benzene toxicity requires a brief
review of benzene toxicity (2,3). Benzene
toxicity to humans exposed in the work-
place has been characterized as either early
reversible hematotoxicity or, with pro-
longed exposure to high doses, irreversible
bone marrow damage. Studies of worker
populations in factories in which benzene
was employed as a solvent (2) showed a
range of hematotoxic effects including ane-
mia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.
In some cases, more than one cell type was
decreased. A decrease in the levels ofall the
classes of blood cell types in the circulation
is termed pancytopenia and is usually
associated with irreversible bone marrow
aplasia. Aplastic anemia is in most cases
fatal. In those who survive aplasia, the
marrow appears to be dysplastic. Myelodys-
plastic syndrome, which has been called
"preleukemia," is probably an early stage of
acute myeloid leukemia. Thus, those inter-
ested in benzene metabolism need to deter-
mine how benzene metabolites contribute
to the production of this series of events
associated with toxicity.
Benzene Metabolism
and Toxicity
The evidence is quite strong that benzene
metabolism plays a critical role in benzene
toxicity (2,3). Thus, inhibition of benzene
metabolism by toluene, a competitive
inhibitor, results in a decrease in benzene
metabolism and a reduction in benzene
toxicity (4). Decreasing the hepatic metab-
olism of benzene by partial hepatectomy
also reduced benzene toxicity, suggesting
that hepatic metabolism plays an impor-
tant role in toxicity (5). In addition to
hepatic metabolism, it appears that sec-
ondary metabolism of benzene metabolites
in bone marrow contributes to toxicity
(6-11). Thus, elucidation of the metabolic
pathway for benzene biotransformation is
essential for a full understanding of the
mechanism oftoxicity.
Metabolic Pathway
for Biotransformation
Figures 1 and 2 show alternative routes by
which the first step ofbenzene metabolism,
namely, phenol formation, can occur.
Cytochrome P4502E1, and perhaps other
cytochromes P450, can generate H202
when acting as oxidases of nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH).
The hydroxyl radical formed from H202
can hydroxylate benzene to yield phenol.
An alternative mechanism for phenol
formation is seen in Figure 2, which is
designed to reflect on the fate of the
benzene oxide-oxepin system. When ben-
zene oxide is the first product, it can
rearrange nonenzymatically to form phe-
nol. Alternatively, benzene oxide can be
hydrated via epoxide hydrolase to yield
1,2-benzene dihydrodiol, which can in turn

be oxidized via dihydrodiol dehydrogenase
to form catechol. The reaction of benzene
oxide with glutathione catalyzed by glu-
tathione S-transferase leads to the formation
of the premercapturic acid. It is likely that
benzene oxide or its oxepin are precursors to
ring opening (12). Phenol can be further
hydroxylated to form hydroquinone or cate-
chol. In theory, 1,2,4-benzenetriol may be
formed by the hydroxylation of either
hydroquinone or catechol; but Inoue et al.
(13) suggested that catechol is not a precur-
sor of 1,2,4-benzenetriol in humans.
Urinary Metabolites
The metabolites of benzene found in urine
are shown in Figure 3. Any of the phenolic
metabolites may be conjugated with either
sulfate or glucuronide. In addition to
L-phenylmercapturic acid reported by Parke
and Williams (1), other mercapturates
include 6-N-acetylcysteinyl-S-2,3-cyclo-
hexadienol (14,15) and 2,5-diOH-phenyl-
mercapturic acid (16). The urine also
contains two ring-opening products, i.e.,
trans-trans-muconic acid (1,17) and 6-
OH-t,t-2,4-hexadienoic acid (18), and the
residue of a covalently bound DNA
adduct, i.e., N7-phenylguanine (19,20).
Microsomal Metabolism
The metabolism of benzene by purified,
reconstituted rat liver CYP4502E1 is char-
acterized by the requirement of the pres-
ence ofcytochrome b5 to obtain maximum
metabolism (21). At low benzene concen-
trations (Table 1), a much larger percent-
age of hydroquinone is formed than at
higher benzene concentrations. The addi-
tion of epoxide hydrolase also stimulates
hydroquinone formation at the expense of
phenol. The role of epoxide hydrolase in
stimulating the second hydroxylation of
benzene is not clear. It may assist in stabi-
lizing CYP4502E1 to continue to hydroxy-
late phenol, the concentration of which
rises as benzene metabolism proceeds.
Alternatively, it may reflect a hitherto
unrecognized metabolic activity leading to
hydroquinone formation. Further study of
this problem is required.
Potential Mechanisms ofToxicity
The production of benzene metabolites,
largely in the liver, is followed by their
transport to the bone marrow and other
organs. There are many possibilities for
causing bone marrow toxicity. Irons and
coworkers (22,23) suggested that covalent
binding of hydroquinone to spindle fiber
protein could explain inhibition of cell

the metabolic activation of benzene to
species that covalently bind to DNA to pro-
duce mutagenic events that are expressed as
leukemia. The second mechanism involves
the production of metabolites that cause
-.dative stress, subsequent oxidative dam-
age to DNA, and a mutagenic effect that has
the same consequences.
Covalent Binding andToxicity
We have known for almost two decades
that benzene is metabolized to species
capable of covalent interaction with cellu-
lar macromolecules. Snyder et al. (25) first
demonstrated that proteins in the bone
marrow and other tissues of mice treated
with radiolabeled benzene in vivo con-
tained covalently bound radiolabel (Table
2). Lutz and Schlatter subsequently demon-
strated covalent binding ofbenzene metabo-
lites to DNA in rat liver (26). Our studies
of the covalent interaction of benzene
metabolites with cellular macromolecules
suggested that this phenomenon might
play an important role in the expression of
toxicity. Sammett et al. (5) showed that in
rats partial hepatectomy correlated with
both protection against benzene toxicity
and reduced levels of covalent binding of
benzene metabolites in bone marrow;
Longacre et al. (27) showed that the levels
of covalently bound metabolites measured
in the hematopoietic tissues were higher in
mouse strains that were more sensitive to
benzene toxicity than in those that were less
sensitive. Rushmore et al. (28) extensively
investigated covalent binding in an isolated
mitochondrial system; they showed that
the benzene metabolites are capable of
covalent binding to DNA and inhibiting
protein and RNA synthesis. To chemically
characterize the DNA adducts formed,
adducts were prepared in vitro by reacting
deoxynucleosides or deoxynucleoside
monophosphates with either p-benzo-
quinone or hydroquinone in the presence
of an oxidizing agent. The combination of
UV, fluorescence, mass, and nuclear mag-
netic resonance spectrometry was first used
by Jowa et al. (29) to identify 3'-OH-
1,N2-benzetheno-2'-deoxyguanosine as a
major deoxyguanosine adduct (Figure 5).
Pongracz et al. (30,31) and Levay et al. (32)
subsequently combined these spectroscopic
methods of structural analysis with the sen-
sitive DNA [32P]postlabeling method of
adduct detection to identify (3'-OH)-3,N4-
benzethenodeoxycytidine-3'-phosphate,
(3'-OH)-1 ,N6-benzetheno-2'-deoxyadeno-
sine-3'-phosphate and (3'-OH)-1,N2-ben-
zetheno-2'deoxyguanosine-3'-phosphate
following the in vitro reaction ofp-benzo-
quinone and calf thymus DNA. The struc-
tures of the deoxyribonucleoside forms of
these adducts are shown in Figure 5.
Although in vitro studies have estab-
lished that reactive metabolites of benzene
covalently bind to DNA, in vivo evidence
of covalent binding has been more difficult
to demonstrate. Initial studies involving
administration of radiolabeled benzene to
rats by Lutz and Schlatter (26) as well as
later studies by Arfellini et al. (33) and
Mazullo et al. (34) using rats and mice,

SNYDER AND HEDLI
These problems may be related to the low
covalent binding index ofbenzene, the com-
plex nature of the bone marrow, and
difficulties in establishing both an optimal
treatment regimen and an animal model
system that accurately reflects all the toxic
responses to benzene observed in humans.
The most consistent demonstrations of
benzene metabolite-induced DNA adduct
formation in a cellular model have been
made using human promyelocytic (HL-60)
cells in culture, a line of myeloid cells that
has the capacity to differentiate in response
to specific chemical stimulants into any of
the four classes of hematopoietic cells of the
myelomonocytic lineage, i.e., granulocytes,
monocytes, eosinophils, or macrophages
(35). Studies using this model and the
[32P]postlabeling method of adduct detec-
tion by Levay et al. have led to the detection
of DNA adducts in benzene metabolite-
treated cells that are not chromatographi-
cally identical with those formed following
the in vitro reaction ofp-benzoquinone and
DNA (32). Although these investigations
showed that benzene metabolites interact
synergistically to produce DNA adducts
(36) and that peroxidase activation of
hydroquinone is required for adduct forma-
tion (37), no attempts were made to link
adduct formation with any end point oftox-
icity other than cytotoxicity. We recently
evaluated the significance of DNA adduct
formation in toxicity by studying the effects
ofbenzene metabolites on DNA adduct for-
mation and retinoic acid-induced granulo-
cytic differentiation in this model (38).
Table 3 shows that while treatment of HL-
60 cells with 50 ,uM hydroquinone for 1 to
4 hr induced the formation ofa single DNA
adduct that increased with increasing time
of exposure, no adducts were detected in
cells treated with 50 to 500 pM 1,2,4-ben-
zenetriol for up to 4 hr. Using the same
incubation conditions, treatment ofthe cells
with either hydroquinone or 1,2,4-benzen-
etriol prior to inducing differentiation with
retinoic acid significantly inhibited their
capacity to differentiate, as assessed by eval-
uating cell morphology, using light and
electron microscopy, and two indicators of
cell functional capacity-phagocytosis and
nitroblue tetrazolium reduction. These data
indicate that DNA adduct formation may
play a role in inhibiting cell differentiation
in hydroquinone but not in 1,2,4-benzen-
etriol-treated cells, and support the con-
tention that various metabolites contribute
to different components of the mechanism
oftoxicity.
Oxidative Stress and Toxicity
The potential for oxidative stress to
contribute to benzene toxicity is closely tied
to specific benzene metabolites. Hydro-
quinone may be oxidized to p-benzo-
quinone, which is highly reactive and can
covalently bind to cellular macromolecules
(above) or to glutathione. Alternatively,
Step 1 Ste
benzene metabolites may engage in redox
cycling, which involves autooxidation of a
reduced form of the metabolite to yield an
oxidized species plus reactive oxygen. The
bone marrow, which is a richly oxygenated
organ, has the capability to generate reactive
oxygen species. The four-electron reduction
of oxygen (39) may generate superoxide
anion radical, hydrogen peroxide, and
hydroxyl radical. The oxidized metabolite
may undergo flavoprotein reduction to yield
the starting material that may reenter the
redox cycle.
It might be postulated that hydro-
quinone-p-benzoquinone would be likely to
undergo redox cycling. Recent studies by
Boersma et al. (40) argue to the contrary.
Figure 6 shows that the reduction ofp-ben-
zoquinone may proceed via a reductase such
as CYP450 reductase in two steps. The first
product would be the semiquinone anion

oxide would occur in redox cycling. However, p-benzoquinone is stoichiometrically reduced to hydroquinone at pH
7.5, the pH of the cell (40).

radical (Step 1), which could either be
reduced again (Step 2A), or may-more
likely-be protonated before the second
reduction (Step 2B). The pKa of the proto-
nation step is 4.1, suggesting that at the pH
of the cell, i.e., approximately 7.5, thean-
ionic form would predominate. Following
the second reduction, the monoanion of
hydroquinone would be formed, but the
PKa for its protonation is 9.85, indicating
that it would exist mainly in the diproto-
nated form. Reoxidation to p-benzo-
quinone, the next step in redox cycling,
would be inhibited because it is the monan-
ion that is the substrate for autooxidation
leading to superoxide anion formation.
Thus, it is unlikely that hydroquinone-p-
benzoquinone undergoes redox cycling at
physiological pH.
The metabolic fate ofp-benzoquinone,
if it is not reduced, may be to react with
glutathione (GSH) to form the premercap-
turic acid of hydroquinone, which may go
on to form the mercapturic acid, or may
undergo slow autooxidation leading to the
production of reactive oxygen species (41)
(Figure 7). Alternatively, p-benzoquinone
may be converted to its epoxide either via
CYP450 or HOOH (Figure 8, Step 1), lead-
ing to p-benzoquinone 2,3-oxide and ulti-
mately to 1,2,4-benzenetriol (Step 2A)
following either a two-electron reduction
by diaphorase or two one-electron reduc-
tions by CYP450 reductase. Reaction of
p-benzoquinone 2,3-oxide with GSH leads
to the formation ofglutathionyl 1,2,4-ben-
zenetriol (Figure 8, Step 2B).
The unique feature of glutathionyl
1,2,4-benzenetriol is its ability to sponta-
neously undergo autooxidation and redox
cycling (Figure 9). Brunmark and Cadenas
(41) showed that glutathionyl benzenetriol
could be sequentially oxidized to glu-
tathionyl-1,2,4-benzenetriol semiquinone

and then to 5-OH-glutathionyl-p-benzo-
quinone (HGB). HGB is also the product
of the reaction between p-benzoquinone
2,3-oxide and glutathionyl-1,2,4-benzene-
triol semiquinone (GBS), which also yields
5-OH-benzosemiquinone. Alternatively,
GBS can undergo disproportionation to
form glutathionyl-1,2,4-benzenetriol, which
can initiate the redox cycle again. If redox
cycling is an important phenomenon in the
mechanism of benzene toxicity, it is likely
that 1,2,4-benzenetriol plays a significant
role in the process.
In a series of studies in HL-60 cells,
hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone and 1,2,4-
benzenetriol were added so that researchers
could study their impacts on oxidative
stress and antioxidant factors (42). Table 4
shows that hydroquinone and p-benzo-
quinone increased superoxide, nitric oxide,
and HOOH production, but that 1,2,4-
benzenetriol, while increasing superoxide
and HOOH, had no effect on nitric oxide
production. Hydroquinone and p-benzo-
quinone but not 1,2,4-benzenetriol
decreased catalase activity. Hydroquinone
and 1,2,4-benzenetriol but not p-benzo-
quinone decreased superoxide dismutase
and hydroquinone and benzenetriol
decreased sulfhydryl levels. Thus, although

Potency of Benzene
and Its Metabolites
in Producing Toxicity
In attempting to sort out the role played by
the various benzene metabolites in the
production of benzene toxicity, it is helpful
to examine the potency with which each of
the metabolites, alone or in combination,
causes toxic effects. There are many stages
in bone marrow cell maturation and ampli-
fication and there are a number of func-
tions peculiar to the stromal cells that
provide targets for attack by benzene and
its metabolites. It would be helpful to
review a range of potencies of each. Table
5 shows the relative potency with which
benzene and its metabolites inhibit ery-
thropoiesis, as measured by the method of
Lee et al. (43) using the [59Fe] uptake
technique. The numbers are not absolute
values but are rounded off to demonstrate
the range of doses at which significant
depressions in red cell production were
observed. The data demonstrate that when
administered to mice in a defined dosing
regimen, benzene is the least potent member
of the series and the combination of hydro-
quinone plus muconaldehyde provides the
greatest potency. The doses of each chemi-
cal used in the latter case were too low for
either muconaldehyde or hydroquinone to
produce bone marrow depression given
independently, but they were highly effec-
tive when given in combination. Many of
the other benzene metabolites were effective
at decreasing iron uptake, albeit with dif-
ferent potencies, except for phenol, which
was clearly ineffective. 1,2,4-Benzenetriol
was ineffective in preliminary studies, but
further work is needed to establish the
significance of these observations, since a
decrease in lymphocytes has been observed
in the bone marrow ofanimals treated with
1,2,4-benzenetriol (CC Hedli and R
Snyder, unpublished observations). In addi-
tion, the recent demonstration of 1,2,4-
benzenetriol as a microsomal metabolite of
benzene in isolated mouse but not rat hepa-
tocytes (44) suggests that the production of

this metabolite might correlate with suscep-

in progress to determine the effect of 1,2,4-
benzenetriol treatment on circulating blood
cells and other hematopoietic tissue.
Summary and Conclusions
Benzene toxicity, which involves both bone
marrow depression and leukemogenesis,
appears to require metabolites of benzene
that impinge on several cell types and on a
variety of functions. We must continue to
study the metabolism of benzene with the
intent of understanding which bone mar-
row cells metabolize benzene and its
metabolites, identifying the specific array
of metabolites responsible for the disease
processes, and ultimately understanding
the relationship between the events in bone
marrow toxicity and the generation of
specific metabolites.
