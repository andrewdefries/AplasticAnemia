Haematopoiesis is a process that requires haematopoietic pro-
genitor cells to differentiate into mature cells of multiple lineages.
The starting point of this maturation is presumably a multi-
potential stem cell, which has the ability of self-renewal and
differentiation into all lineages. The regulation of differentiation
depends on a variety of cellular and soluble factors provided in
part by the so-called marrow microenvironment consisting of
stromal elements (Tavassoli and Friedenstein, 1983; Huss et al,
1995a). Other factors may function in an autocrine fashion, and
cell–cell interactions are also of pivotal importance. During differ-
entiation, many transcriptional events occur in a way so that they
provide the essential gene products for a certain stage of differen-
tiation (Dorshkind, 1990; Eaves et al, 1991).
Cell division in eukaryotic cells is further controlled by sequen-
cial activation of a family of serine-threonine protein kinases,
known as cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). cdks regulate progres-
sion through various key transitions in the cell cycle of all eukary-
otes studied so far. Two distinct cdks, cdk4 or cdk6 and cdk2,
control G1 progression and entry into S phase. Inactivation of
either kinase leads to cell cycle arrest and withdrawal from the
mitotic cycle (Roberts et al, 1994; Sher and Roberts, 1995).
In recent years, a growing number of proteins, named collec-
tively as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (cdkis) were charac-
terized as negative regulators of G1 cdks. Three members of the
cdki family, p21waf-1/cip-1
, p27kip-1
and p57kip-2
contain a conserved
domain at its N-terminal end that is both necessary and sufficient
for inhibition of G1 cyclin–cdk complexes. In addition, p21 also
binds to the DNA polymerase δ progression factor, proliferation
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), forming quaternary complexes
containing a cyclin, a cdk and PCNA (Li et al, 1994; Waga et al,
1994). The PCNA binding activity is not observed with p27 or p57
(Luo et al, 1995). cdkis are considered versatile negative regula-
tors of cell proliferation, likely in a cell-type specific manner
(Elledge et al, 1994). They also have been implicated as targets of
differentiation-inducing agents, for example, induction of p21 by
the vitamin D receptor in myelomonocytic cells (Liu et al, 1996).
There is also evidence supporting a role of cdkis in promoting
differentiation since ectopic expression of either p21 or p27 in
myelomonocytic cells induce both cell cycle arrest and induction
of specific markers indicative of differentiation (Elledge and
Harper, 1994; Huss et al, 1995b).
We established a CD34-negative, canine progenitor cell line,
D064, derived from the canine marrow microenvironment (Huss
et al., 1995c). These D064 cells usually grow adherent and show
the typical fibroblast-like morphology of stromal cells. They
support haematopoiesis in long-term marrow cultures, but are also
able to differentiate into cells with characteristics of haemato-
poietic progenitors (Huss et al, 1995d). This differentiation

Summary A CD34-negative haematopoietic progenitor cell line, D064, derived from canine bone marrow stromal cells is able to differentiate
into haematopoietic progenitors under the influence of growth factor-mediated signalling. While differentiating, these cells eventually start to
express MHC class II molecules (DR homologues) on their surface. The stable transfection of the fibroblast-like wild-type cells with retroviral
constructs containing the cDNA for the canine MHC class II DR-genes (DRA and DRB) induces a change in morphology, accelerates cell
cycle progression and leads to a loss of anchorage-dependent growth. Transfected cells show features of an immature stem cell leukaemia,
such as giant cell formation. In wild-type D064 cells the accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (cdki) p27kip-1
induces
differentiation, which is dependent upon signalling via the ligand for the tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit (stem cell factor). DR-transfected cells
instead apparently grow independently of any growth factor-mediated signals and express high levels of the cdkis p27kip-1
and especially
p21waf-1/cip-1
, concurrently with accelated cell cycle progression. In contrast to the overexpression of cdkis and despite accelerated cell cycle
progression, the expression of the G2/M phase transition kinase p34cdc2
is significantly reduced in DR-transfected and transformed cells as
compared to the haematopoietic wild-type cell line D064. This might suggest a possible alternative cell cycle progression pathway in this
experimental stem cell leukaemia by by-passing the G0/G1 phase arrest, although retinoblastoma (Rb)-phosphorylation remains unaltered.
These results provide evidence that mechanisms normally controlling the cell cycle and early haematopoietic differentiation are disrupted by
the constitutive transcription and expression of MHC class II genes (DR) leading to a progression and growth of this experimental stem cell
leukaemia independent from cell cycle controlling regulators such as p27 and p21. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaign

towards lineage commitment can be induced by the addition of
stem cell factor (SCF). On the contrary, interleukin-6 (IL-6) rather
promotes proliferation and is counteracting differentiation (Huss
et al, 1995a). Both factors, SCF as well as IL-6, are produced by
D064 cells themselves (Huss et al, 1994). During differentiation,
D064 cells partly lose their ability to grow adherent and morpho-
logically resemble early haematopoietic progenitors. At this stage,
D064 wild-type (wt) cells express p27kip-1
. p27 values decline
during IL-6-mediated proliferation or treatment with an anti-SCF
antibody (Huss et al, 1995b). Furthermore, D064 cells start to
transcribe and express CD34 and eventually express MHC class II
(DR) antigens as differentiation markers during SCF-mediated
differentiation. The expression of MHC class II antigens is
apparently of pivotal importance for a functional haematopoiesis
in the dog in vitro and in vivo (Deeg et al, 1994). If anti-MHC
class II monoclonal antibodies, directed at non-polymorphic deter-
minants, are administered in vitro or in vivo, haematopoietic
reconstitution is inhibited (Greinix et al, 1991). Similarly the
presence of anti-class II monoclonal antibodies in long-term
cultures and colony formation assays inhibit haematopoiesis in
vitro (Hong et al, 1995). But the addition of exogenous SCF
prevents or overcomes this inhibition both in vivo and in vitro at
least in part by preventing apoptosis in a subpopulation of
adherent and non-adherent cells (Hong et al, 1995).
Here we examined the effect of MHC class II molecules (DR)
when constitutively expressed in a CD34-negative haematopoietic
progenitor cell line. Those D064 cells were transfected with canine
MHC class II (DRA and DRB) genes to investigate the effect on
cell biology. As shown previously, DR-expressing cell clones
show cellular transformation and tumour growth in mice, similar
to an immature stem cell leukaemia (Huss et al, 1997), suggesting
a disruption of mechanisms normally controlling the cell cycle. In
this study we wanted to further dissect the molecular events
involved in such an alternative cell cycle progression pathway,
which might possibly play a role in leukaemic transformation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cell lines
The stroma-derived cell line D064 was established from canine
marrow propagated in long-term cultures and by selecting colony-
forming-unit (CFU)-fibroblast as described elsewhere (Huss et al,
1995c). These fibroblast-like cells function as stromal cells by
supporting haematopoiesis in long-term culture-initiating assays
(LTC-IC), but are also able to differentiate into cells with
haematopoietic characteristics. The adherent growing fibroblast-
like D064 cells generally do not express detectable levels of differ-
entiation markers, such as CD34 or MHC class II antigens (DR),
but transcribe the mRNA for various growth factors (Huss et al,
1994). However, differentiation can be induced by SCF and D064
cells start to express CD34 and MHC class II-molecules (DR)
on their surface. The cells then acquire a tendency to grow in a
non-adherent fashion and resemble morphologically and by
immunohistocytochemistry resemble haematopoietic progenitor
cells.
Experimental stem cell leukaemia
As described already elsewhere, the CD34-negative haemato-
poietic progenitor cell line D064 was stably transfected with
retroviral constructs containing the open reading frame of DRA
and DRB (Huss et al, 1997). The selection marker resistent cell
clones were further selected for high levels of DR-expression.
Immunohistochemistry
The expression of p27 in transfected and non-transfected cells was
evaluated by immunophenotyping using a monoclonal antibody
directed against p27kip-1
. D064 cells and the DR+
clone no. 14 were
grown in chamber slides (NUNC) and fixed with ethanol. Cells
were then permeabilized using Triton X-100 and stained with the
appropriate primary antibody (Santa Cruz). Unspecific staining
was blocked using the Universal powerblock (Biogenex) in a one-
tenth dilution for 15 min prior to using the primary antibody.
Immunodetection staining was carried out with the Multilink
detection kit (Biogenex) using alkaline-phosphatase conjugated
streptavidin and Fast Red.
Western blot analysis
A total of 5 × 106
transfected (clone no. 14) or non-transfected
D064 cells were grown with or without SCF (100 ng ml–1
) for 2,
24, 48 and 96 h and solubilized with lysis buffer. Equal amounts of
protein were loaded in each lane of the gel as determined by
quantitative spectrophotometry. The gels were blotted overnight
on a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham) by electrophoretic
transfer at 4°C. Non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked
with 1 mg ml–1
instant, non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). The filter was incubated with anti-p27, anti-p21,
anti-p34 (Santa Cruz) and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20,
Pharmingen) as the primary antibody. After washing, the
secondary alkaline-phosphatase detection antibody (Tago,
Burlingame, CA, USA) was added. After 1-h incubation, the
membrane was again thoroughly washed and incubated in chemi-
luminescence substrate (CSPD) solution (Clontech Laboratories)
for 5 min. The membrane was then placed on an X-ray film for 3 s
(Firpo et al, 1994; Nourse et al, 1994). In one set of the experi-
ments the lysed cell preparation was immunoprecipitated with an
anti-Rb monoclonal antibody (Oncogen) as described elsewhere
(Haefner et al, 1994; Weissinger et al, 1997).
Cell cycle analysis
At various time points, monolayers of transfected and non-trans-
fected D064 cells were treated with trypsin (0.05%) for 15 min at
37°C. Cells were washed with 1 × Hanks balanced salt solution
(HBSS) and processed for DNA content. Briefly, 1 × 106
cells
were resuspended in 250 µl of buffer A (10 mmol l–1
Tris–HCl,
pH 7.5; 20 mmol l–1
sodium chloride, 20 mmol l–1
magnesium
chloride). After 5 min on ice, 250 µl of buffer B was added (buffer
A containing 1% NP-40) and the mixture was incubated for
another 5 min on ice. Then DNAase-free RNAase at a final
concentration of 2.5 µg was added and nuclei were incubated at
37°C for 30 min. Finally, 500 µl of propidium iodide (PI) solution
(1 × HBSS containing 100 µg ml–1
PI (Sigma), 0.1% Triton X-100
(USB), fetal bovine serum (HyClone)) was added to each tube and
were left in the dark at 4°C for 1 h before reading. The DNA
content was determined by FACScan analysis using LYSIS II soft-
ware (Becton Dickinson). Cell-cycle analysis was performed with
the Multicycle computer program after analysing the data by
Reproman software (Fine Facts Software, Seattle, WA, USA).

RESULTS
Transfection of D064 cells
Parental CD34-negative D064 cells were transfected sequentially
with the genes for canine DRA and DRB. The cDNA was
contained in retroviral vectors using neomycin-phosphotransferase
and L-histidin-dehydrogenase respectively as selection markers
(Miller and Rosman, 1989). Transfectants were selected in the
appropriate selection media. D064 cells, which were transfected
only with the plasmid without any insert or with the inserts in the
reverse orientation were used as controls. After selecting for
antibiotic-resistant cell populations, transfected cells were sorted
for high DR expression. Cell clones were established, which either
contained both DRA and DRB genes or expressed high levels of
DR on the surface. Control clones and non-transfected D064
clones did not transcribe any message for MHC class II (Huss et al,
1997). DR+
clones were further propagated and used for the
experiments (Huss et al, 1997). The transfected DR+
cells lost their
ability for contact inhibition when reaching confluency in culture.
They also lost in part their ability to grow adherent and are
predominately smaller than the non-transfected D064 cells. But as
shown in Figure 1, MHC class II transfected cells though even
sometimes show giant cell formation, suggesting a disruption of
events controlling the cell cycle.
Cell cycle progression of transfected D064 cells
Transfected cells are smaller than untransfected parental cells and
do not require anchorage-dependent growth. DR+
transfectants not
only showed changes in their morphology as compared to the
D064 wildtype, but also showed alterations of cell cycle progres-
sion. DR+
-transfected cell clones displayed a doubling time of
14.5 h as compared to approximately 48 h in parental DR–D064
cells. Accordingly, the analysis of the cell cycle showed that the
number of DR+
-transfected cells in G2/M phase was almost twice
as high as compared to the non-transfected controls over time
(Table 1). This change was also reflected in the cumulative number
of cells in culture with increasing time. While the wt D064 cells
showed the typical pattern of lag and log-phase (0–48 h) with a
growth inhibition at the confluent phase (72–96 h) (Figure 2), the
DR-transfected cells showed a linear growth pattern with no
significant stationary phase (not shown). The transfection-induced
changes were seen only with constructs carrying the open reading
frames of DRA and DRB in the correct orientation. Constructs
with DRA and DRB in reverse orientation or vectors without insert
did not differ from the parental cells (Huss et al, 1997).

Growth factor dependent p27kip-1
expression
After 24 h of serum starvation D064 cells were treated with SCF
for 2, 24, 48 and 96 h. p27kip-1
accumulation was seen with
increasing time (Figure 3). Also D064 cells, which were not
treated with SCF at any time, show an equally high expression
level of p27 after 96 h, suggesting a significant production of
endogenous SCF in an autocrine or paracrine manner (Huss et al,
1994). The accumulation of p27 in D064 cells correlated with the
increasing number of cells, arrested in G0/G1 phase of the cell
cycle (Table 1).
Immunophenotyping for p27kip-1
Wt D064 cells and DR-transfected cell clones were immuno-
stained for p27 expression after 24 h of SCF treatment. The
untransfected wt D064 cells hardly showed any p27 expression
and possibly only those which underwent differentiation (Figure
4A). In contrast, almost all DR+
cells (clone no. 14) showed a
more or less strong p27 expression, especially in the smaller cells
(Figure 4B).
Expression of p27 and p21
Both wt D064 and DR-transduced D064 cells were placed in tissue
culture flasks on day 0 at a concentration of 5 × 106
cells ml–1
.
They were grown until they reached confluency on day 4. Using
equal amounts of protein for Western blot analysis, p27 was
expressed over time in the spontaneously differentiating D064
cells. However, the DR+
cell clones (e.g. clone no. 14) expressed
elevated levels of p27 despite a higher proliferation rate. D064
cells also showed only detectable levels of p21 on day 4 during the

DR-transfected cells showed increased expression of cdkis.

remains unaltered during haematopoietic differentiation.
Phosphorylation of Rb
The key element of cell cycle transition is the phosphorylation of
the Rb protein, finally showing a molecular weight of the phos-
phorylated isoform from 105 to 113 kDa. Despite an acceleration
of the cell cycle and overexpression of cdkis in DR-transfected
cells, the phosphorylation of the Rb-protein remained unaltered, as
compared to the untransfected wt cells (Figure 7).
DISCUSSION
The marrow stroma-derived, CD34-negative cell line D064
usually grows adherent as fibroblast-like cells with a constant
pattern of growth. When cells reach confluency in culture, growth
is inhibited by a mechanism yet to be defined (Rubin et al, 1990).
D064 cells can be induced to differentiate by SCF. If SCF is added
to D064 cell cultures, D064 cells start to round up, lose their
ability to adhere and most notably start to express differentiation
antigens such as CD34 and eventually MHC class II (DR) (Huss et
al, 1995c). Here we transfected D064 cells with retroviral
constructs containing the MHC class II genes (DR). The majority
of DR+
-transfected cells appear to be smaller than the adherent
growing fibroblast-like parental cell line D064, although giant cell
formation can occur. They also rounded up and lost in part their
ability to grow adherent. In addition, the transfected DR+
cells
displayed significant changes in their growth pattern. The DR+
transfectants had a significantly shortened division time as
compared to parental D064 cells (14.5 vs 48 hours) and no longer
showed contact inhibition in culture.
Transfection induced expression of MHC class II (DR) in the
D064 cell was associated with cellular transformation in vitro and
tumour forming ability in vivo (Huss et al, 1997). It appeared
therefore, that the transformation ablated the growth controlling
mechanisms as required for controlled growth in vitro and in vivo
(Shin et al, 1975). Since the observed transformational events are
not associated with any kind of retroviral signalling (mock trans-
fection does not yield transformation), but rather relates to an
induction of MHC class II (DR) expression, although initiated by
the retroviral vector driven MHC class II gene (DR), expression
(Glimcher and Kara, 1992). The fact that MHC class II expression
continued to be present only in cell clones that had been specifi-
cally transfected with MHC class II genes, further suggests that the
observed changes were related to specific expressed genes rather
than due to the vector or insertional mutagenesis, since all other
control transfectants remained unaltered. The expression of DR
enables the cells to receive and transmit signals via MHC class II
antigens (Lane et al, 1990), a signal transduction pathway yet
unknown. Nevertheless, it is possible that MHC class II expression
is just one parameter correlated with the transformation process.
The overexpression of MHC class II in early haematopoietic stem
cells parallels a specific signal transduction pathway in the trans-
duced cells which actually leads to a cellular transformation. We
have shown that SCF induces CD34, transforming growth factor β
and p27kip-1
transcription in the parental D064 cell line (Huss et al,
1995e). While the expression of certain factors during differentia-
tion and proliferation is strictly regulated in the parental cell line,
the DR+
-transfected cell clones have lost the ability to regulate
those functions due to the transformational event. As demonstrated
in other tumours (Elledge et al, 1996), the overexpression of the
cdkis p27 and p21 was also seen in DR-transfected cells. cdkis
apparently fail to control the cell cycle, suggesting the possibility
that the overexpression of p27 and p21 was due to the accumula-
tion of a dysfunctional mutant, as described for p53 (Kamp, 1995).
This still has to be analysed in the DR-transfected cells, although
p21 or p27 mutants have not been described so far. Nevertheless,
there might be a disruption of forming the complex between cdks,
cyclins, PCNA and their inhibitors or it exists as an alternative
pathway bypassing the known cell cycle regulating mechanisms.
The low expression or even down-regulation of p34cdc2
as a down-
stream regulator of the cell cycle progression provides even more
evidence for such a ‘bypass hypothesis’, especially in view of the
unaltered phosphorylation pattern of the Rb protein.
The exact mechanisms of transformation of the DR-transfected,
CD34-negative D064 cells are yet not known. Although there is a
correlation between MHC class II expression and transformation,

we can not exclude the possibility that other molecular events
involved in signal transduction pathways between any transmem-
brane signalling and nuclear activation might contribute to the
transformation process, suggesting an alternative cell cycle
progression pathway as known for most ‘normal’ prokaryotic and
eukaryotic cells.
In summary, we have shown that the transfection and subse-
quent expression of differentiation antigen, such as MHC class II
genes in haematopoietic progenitor cells, can induce cellular trans-
formation and leads to a dysregulation of cell cycle control.
