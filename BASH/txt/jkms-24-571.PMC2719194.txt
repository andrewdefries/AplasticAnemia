INTRODUCTION
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease continues to be an impor-
tant cause of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. We have been conduct-
ing a preemptive strategy based on the CMV pp65 antigen-
emia assay for the prevention of CMV infection and disease
in a risk-adapted manner (1). Although the antigenemia assay
has been used extensively as a tool to monitor CMV infections,
there are several limitations, including 1) the need for imme-
diate sample processing, 2) the nonstandardization of sample
processing between laboratories, 3) the time-consuming and
laborious procedure, and 4) the lack of objectivity of quantifi-
cation (2-4). Furthermore, as the detection of antigenemia is
applicable only to blood specimens (only virus associated with
cells), it requires an adequate number of leukocytes.
Recently, several studies have demonstrated that real-time
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) for CMV
is useful for the rapid diagnosis of CMV infection and for the
monitoring of clinical responses to antiviral therapy (5-11).
However, there is, as yet, no consensus regarding the cutoff
level and the appropriate blood compartment to be tested by
RQ-PCR assay in HSCT recipients.
In this study, we compared RQ-PCR with the pp65 anti-
genemia assay for the monitoring of CMV infection in allo-
geneic HSCT recipients. Additionally, we have determined
the proper cutoff level of CMV DNA load for preemptive
therapy, in order to switch the monitoring method from the
antigenemia assay to an RQ-PCR method.

Comparison of Quantitative Cytomegalovirus Real-time PCR in Whole
Blood and pp65 Antigenemia Assay: Clinical Utility of CMV Real-time
PCR in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients
Successful preemptive therapy for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in transplant
patients depends on the availability of sensitive, specific, and timely diagnostic tests
for CMV infection. Although the pp65 antigenemia assay has been widely used for
this purpose, real-time quantification of CMV DNA has recently been recognized
as an alternative diagnostic approach. However, the guidelines for antiviral therapy
based on real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) have yet to
be established. From November 2004 to March 2005, a total of 555 whole blood
samples from 131 hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients were prospec-
tively collected. RQ-PCR was conducted using an Artus�
CMV LC PCR kit (QIA-
GEN). Both qualitative and quantitative correlations were drawn between the two
methods. Exposure to the antiviral agent influenced the results of the two assays.
Additionally, the discrepancy was observed at low levels of antigenemia and CMV
DNA load. Via ROC curve analysis, the tentative cutoff value for preemptive thera-
py was determined to be approximately 2×104
copies/mL (sensitivity, 80.0%; speci-
ficity, 50.0%) in the high risk patients, and approximately 3×104
copies/mL (sensi-
tivity, 90.0%; specificity, 70.0%) in the patients at low risk for CMV disease. Further
study to validate the optimal cutoff value for the initiation of preemptive therapy is
currently underway.

imens were prospectively collected from allogeneic HSCT re-
cipients who had been admitted to the Catholic HSCT Cen-
ter. During the study period, the pp65 antigenemia assay and
RQ-PCR for CMV were performed simultaneously twice a
week after engraftment until day 100, after which they were
conducted on a biweekly or monthly basis until the termi-
nation of immunosuppressant therapy. During this period,
antigenemia assay was used to guide the preemptive thera-
py in a risk-adapted manner (1).
CMV pp65 antigenemia assay
The antigenemia assay was performed as previously descri-
bed, with some modifications (12).
In brief, EDTA-treated whole blood samples were fraction-
ated by dextran sedimentation and lysis of erythrocytes. The
leukocytes were then centrifuged and placed on Cytospin
(Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.) slides
(2.0×105
leukocytes per slide), fixed in paraformaldehyde,
reacted with monoclonal antibodies C10/C11 (Clonab CMV;
Biotest, Dreieich, Germany), and immunostained by the alka-
line phosphatase/anti-alkaline phosphatase method, with the
presence of dark brown nuclear staining considered as a pos-
itive reaction. The results were expressed as the number of
positive cells per 200,000 leukocytes.
Quantitative real-time PCR for CMV DNA
DNA was extracted from 200 μL of whole blood using a
QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (QIAGEN) in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR was performed on the
LightCycler�
1.2 instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany) using Artus�
CMV LC PCR kit (QIAGEN). Each
reaction tube contained 15 μLof master mix and a 5 μLaliquot
of the extracted sample DNA or sterile water (as a negative
control). The thermocycling protocol consisted of an initial
10 min incubation at 95℃ to activate the DNA polymerase.
Then a touch-down procedure followed that consisted of 5
sec at 95℃, annealing for 20 sec at temperatures decreasing
from 65℃ to 55℃ during the first 10 cycles (with 1℃ de-
creasing steps for each cycle) and an extension step at 72℃
for 15 sec. The annealing temperature for the remaining 40
cycles was 55℃ for 20 sec. The products were analyzed by
melting-curve analysis by applying 95℃ for 1 sec, 50℃ for
15 sec, and 80℃ for 0 sec. All acquired fluorescence data were
analyzed using LightCycler software. The detection limit of
the assay is 64.9 copies/mL clinical specimens. It detected
CMV DNA in a linear range from 500 to 1×107
copies/mL.
RQ-PCR values of <500 copies/mL were assigned an arbi-
trary value of 500 copies/mL.
Statistical analysis
Analysis was conducted using the SPSS software, version
13.0 (SPSS Korea, Seoul, Korea). The proportion of positive
and negative results were compared by the chi-square test.
Pearson’s correlation was used to compare antigenemia with
RQ-PCR values. Samples negative for either of the two tests
were excluded from the correlation analysis. P values of less
than 0.05 were considered significant.
Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was
conducted in order to determine a cutoff value of the CMV
DNA load in whole blood for the initiation of preemptive
therapy. Clinical practice had been based on the pp65 anti-
genemia assay, and therefore this assay was used as a standard
to determine the optimal cutoff value for CMV DNA load
by RQ-PCR.
RESULTS
Demographic characteristics of the patients
One hundred and thirty-one patients (87 adult and 44 pe-
diatric) were consecutively enrolled during the study period,
and a total of 555 whole blood samples were collected from
these patients (average 4.2 samples per patient). There were
68 men and 63 women, with an average of 27.0 yr in a range
of 1 to 58 yr. The most common underlying disease was acute
leukemia. And more detailed demographic characteristics of
the patients are summarized in Table 1. Seventy-two (55.0%)
patients received transplants from HLA-identical siblings and
59 (45.0%) patients from unrelated HLA-matched donors
(Table 1). Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1,000/
μL) at the time of blood sampling was detected in 16.9% of
total specimens (94/555).

Incidence of CMV infection and qualitative results of
antigenemia and real-time PCR
CMV infection was detected in 84/555 (15.1%) whole bl-
ood samples by RQ-PCR and 143/555 (25.8%) samples by
pp 65 antigenemia. Per patient analysis, CMV infection was
observed in 34 (30.0%) patients by RQ-PCR and 45 (34.4%)
patients by pp65 antigenemia. Both methods detected CMV
reactivation more frequently in the unrelated transplant re-
cipients than in the sibling recipients (37.3% vs. 16.7%,
P=0.007 by RQ-PCR, 47.5% vs. 23.6%, P=0.004 by anti-
genemia).
Concordant results of the two tests were observed in 460
(82.9%) out of 555 specimens (kappa=0.483, P<0.0001,
Table 2). Out of 95 discrepant samples, 77 (81.1%) were de-
termined to be positive on antigenemia assay but negative
on RQ-PCR and 18 were negative on antigenemia assay but
positive on RQ-PCR. Significant factor influencing the dis-
crepant qualitative results was the exposure to the anti-CMV
drugs (P<0.001). Upon subgroup analysis, specimens col-
lected during anti-CMV therapy showed concordance, with
a kappa value of 0.303 (P=0.001). However, the antiviral
naive samples evidenced concordance with a higher kappa
value of 0.539 (P<0.0001). Out of discrepant samples, anti-
gen-positive but RQ-PCR negative samples were more fre-
quently exposed to the anti-CMV agents than antigen-neg-
ative but RQ-PCR positive samples. However, this was not
statistically significant (48.1% vs. 33.3%, P=0.101). The
discrepant data revealed a significantly lower value of anti-
genemia (mean±SD, cells/200,000 leukocytes; 8.1±17.6
vs. 23.0±111.4, P=0.007) and CMV DNA load (mean±
SD, copies/mL; 5,690±18,453 vs. 35,539±267,087, P=
0.018) than those was observed with the concordant data. The
presence of neutropenia at the sampling time did not affect
the concordance of the two methods.
Correlation between pp65 antigenemia and quantitative
real-time CMV PCR
A statistically significant correlation was observed between
the CMV DNA load by RQ-PCR and the number of pp65
antigen-positive cells (r=0.569, P<0.0001, Fig. 1). Adjust-
ed analysis with possible confounding factors, such as the pres-
ence of neutropenia at the sampling time, also evidenced cor-
relation (r=0.590, P<0.0001). Subgroup analysis revealed no
correlation between the two methods with the specimens col-
lected during anti-CMV therapy. However, the samples which
were naive to the anti-CMV agents were significantly corre-
lated (r=0.743, P<0.0001).
Upon longitudinal analysis for the individual patients, the
follow-up curves of the CMV DNA load by RQ-PCR and
pp65 antigenemia were uniform and no discrepancies were
noted between the two methods in response to anti-CMV
therapy (Fig. 2). The duration of follow up of enrolled patients
was a median of 1,126 days with a range of 22-3,099 days.
There were 2 confirmed cases of CMV diseases (Fig. 3). Pati-
ent A was a 7-yr old girl who had undergone cord blood tran-
splantation and experienced acute GVHD (grade IV). CMV
infection was detected by both methods at the 20th day after
transplantation and preemptive ganciclovir (GCV) therapy
was instituted and both viral copies and antigenemia were
decreased to zero. After the cessation of GCV, the viral DNA
loads increased earlier than antigenemia and both increased
continuously despite the GCV therapy. GCV was switched
to foscarnet (FOS) but the patient developed CMV pneumo-
nia and died as a result of it. Patient B was a 57-yr old woman
who underwent peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
from a matched sibling donor. She received alemtuzumab as
a conditioning regimen. CMV infection was detected by both
RQ-PCR and pp65 antigenemia on the 21st day after trans-
plantation. Viral load and the number of pp65 antigen-pos-
itive cells were somewhat discrepant during the early period
of antiviral therapy. She received GCV and FOS with CMV
immunoglobulin alone or in combination, guided by pp65

oped. After 2 months of intravenous antiviral therapy, she was
treated with maintenance oral GCV and CMV specific cyto-
toxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunotherapy once per month.
She survived, and the viral load was reduced below detectable
levels by both methods.
Determination of CMV DNA cutoff values
Samples naive to the anti-CMV agents were included only
for ROC curve analysis. At present, the cutoff value of pp65
antigenemia for the beginning of preemptive GCV therapy
was more than 5 antigen-positive cells in the low risk pati-
ents, and more than 1 antigen-positive cell in the high risk
patients (1). If an antigenemia value of ≥5 was used as a
standard, the optimal inflection point was located between
a CMV DNA load of 29,308 copies/mL (sensitivity, 90.0%;
specificity, 68.2%) and 36,593 copies/mL (sensitivity, 90.0%;
specificity, 72.7%), as shown in Fig. 4A. If more than 1 anti-
gen-positive cell was utilized as a standard, the trade-off in-
flection point for CMV DNA load was located between
19,226 copies/mL (sensitivity, 80.0%; specificity, 41.7%)
and 21,419 copies/mL (sensitivity, 80.0%; specificity, 58.3%)
(Fig. 4B). Thus, tentative CMV DNA cutoff values were sug-
gested approximately 3×104
copies/mL (sensitivity, 90.0%;
specificity, 70.0%) in the low risk patients and approximate-
ly 2×104
copies/mL (sensitivity, 80.0%; specificity, 50.0%)
in the high risk patients. A cutoff level of 3×104
CMV DNA
copies/mL showed a positive predictive value of 79.4% and
a negative predictive value of 96.5% in the low risk patients.
A cutoff level of 2×104
CMV DNA copies/mL revealed a
positive predictive value of 86.5% and a negative predictive

DISCUSSION
Quantitative detection of CMV DNA using real-time PCR
has become an increasingly popular method for the monitor-
ing of CMV reactivation and for the initiation of antiviral
therapy in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients (4-11,
13-19). It has been suggested that RQ-PCR has several ad-
vantages over the antigenemia assay, including an increased
sensitivity for the detection of CMV reactivation, the reliable
detection of CMV reactivation during severe neutropenia in
the early post-transplant period, the shorter time required
for the procedure, and the convenient processing of large nu-
mbers of specimens (2, 3). For all of these reasons, we attempt-
ed to replace the antigenemia assay with RQ-PCR for the
monitoring of CMV reactivation.
However, the replacement of the antigenemia assay with
RQ-PCR is not a simple matter. The first task was the deter-
mination of the optimal specimen for RQ-PCR. There have
been several reports addressing the proper specimen for RQ-
PCR (3, 9, 15, 16, 20). Most of these studies have utilized
plasma, whole blood, and leukocytes, and reported that these
specimens correlated well with one another. Although CMV
is closely associated with leukocytes, CMV DNA can also be
detected in the plasma while the virus is undergoing active
viral replication. However, inconsistencies in the storage pro-
cedures for blood samples and the separation of plasma from
whole blood can result in artificially increased CMV viral
loads secondary to cell lysis. Inhomogeneity of leukocyte ly-
sates can lead to variability and inaccuracies in results. Addi-
tionally, blood is simpler to process, as it requires one less
centrifugation step than does plasma preparation. Due to its
higher sensitivity and higher CMV DNA yield, whole blood
has been accepted more recently as an optimal sample for
CMV DNA quantification (3, 15, 16, 18, 20). Thus, we elec-
ted to test whole blood rather than plasma or leukocyte lysates
for CMV viral load detection.
The next step was the establishment of precise relationship
between the two methods. Most of all, we observed a quali-
tative and quantitative correlation between the pp65 antigen-
emia value and the viral load estimated by RQ-PCR. Addi-
tionally, in the longitudinal analysis of individual patients,
the follow-up curves of RQ-PCR and pp65 antigenemia were
relatively uniform and well correlated in response to antivi-
ral therapy. The majority of the discordant samples were either
in patients receiving anti-CMV therapy, in whom the DNA
versus protein levels appeared to decline at different rates, or
in the patients with very low viral burdens, in whom we sus-

pect that sampling error or variable lower limits of detection
may have contributed to the discrepancy. There have been
some reports asserting that increasing or persistently high
levels of antigenemia during treatment with GCV were asso-
ciated with decreasing or persistently low levels of DNA load
and viremia, thus revealing an unexplained dissociation (21,
22). Additionally, the pp65 antigen tends to disappear at a
later time than CMV DNA after anti-CMV treatment. Thus,
the determination of cutoff values for preemptive treatment
was conducted only with the results of samples naive to the
anti-CMV agents. Unusually, sensitivity of the antigenemia
assay was found to be higher than that of RQ-PCR for the
detection of CMV reactivation in this study. We thought that
anti-CMV therapy might have affected these results. About
half of 77 specimens determined to be positive on antigene-
mia assay but negative on RQ-PCR, were under anti-CMV
therapy. Additionally, false positivity of antigenemia caused
by cytoplasmatic background staining might also affect the
results (23, 24). On the other hand, there was a report that
purer nuclear acid extracts and a better depletion of PCR in-
hibitors by the automated nucleic acid isolation could addi-
tionally improve PCR performance and increase the sensitivi-
ty of RQ-PCR (13, 15). Thus, we began to use automated
nucleic acid isolation after this study. As our study was con-
ducted during a limited designated period, specimens were
not fully collected from the initial reactivation of CMV after
engraftment in every patient. In some patients, only samples
from the middle of antiviral therapy or after the discontinu-
ation of anti-CMV drugs were included. We surmised that
the characteristics of this uneven sample also influenced the
results. And because of this reason, we could not compare the
point that which method could detect reactivation of CMV
earlier than the other. We could analyze the data of 18 select-
ed patients, whose serial samples were collected from the ini-
tial increase of CMV viral load to the termination of anti-
CMV therapy. Subgroup analysis revealed that the first detec-
tion time of reactivation did not differ between the two meth-
ods and also the cutoff value did not differ from that of the
overall group (data not shown). As the kinetics of the CMV
DNA viral load differ from that of antigenemia, we think
that the consistency in serial values between the two meth-
ods is more important than the concordance at a point.
Although RQ-PCR assays have become quite popular, gui-
delines for antiviral therapy based on these methods have yet
to be established. Like the antigenemia assay, RQ-PCR assays
also lack standardization. Different institutions have devel-
oped their own assays and local guidelines, and these vary
depending on the type of specimen and the assay design. In
our HSCT center, pp65 antigenemia guided preemptive the-
rapy has been conducted in a risk adapted manner (1). Pati-
ents were classified into low and high risk groups in accor-
dance with HSCT type and the grade of acute GVHD. High
risk patients were defined as those who had unrelated donors
and any grade of acute GVHD, or who had matched related
donors and grade II to IV acute GVHD. The patients with
matched related donors and grade 0 to I acute GVHD were
classified as low risk patients. GCV treatment was initiated
when 5 or more CMV antigen-positive cells were detected
in the low risk patients and when any antigen-positive cells
were detected in the high risk patients. Thus, considering
an antigenemia value of more than 5 antigen-postivie cells
or more than 1 antigen-positive cell as a standard, respective-
ly, the optimal cutoff value was provided in Fig. 4. We sug-
gested that the tentative cutoff value was 20,000 copies/mL
for the high risk patients and 30,000 copies/mL for the low
risk group. Usually, RQ-PCR was introduced in order to al-
low for the more sensitive, rapid, and accurate diagnosis of
CMV reactivation in HSCT recipients, which allowed for
preemptive therapy to be administered as early as possible.
However, in this study, RQ-PCR showed lower sensitivity
than antigenemia. So, we defined present cutoff value as the
“tentative” one, because of the reasons described above. At
the same time, we were concerned that these cutoff values
were somewhat higher than those suggested previously (9,
17). Lilleri et al. suggested a cutoff value of 10,000 copies/mL
for the initiation of preemptive therapy in the HSCT recipi-
ents, and that group conducted randomized clincal trials com-
paring RQ-PCR and antigenemia guided preemptive thera-
py (17, 25, 26). However, they did not conduct preemptive
therapy in a risk adapted fashion. Additionally, Kalpoe et al.
also suggested that preemptive therapy could be initiated at
CMV DNA load of 10,000 copies/mL or 1,000 copies/mL,
and then increased by 10-fold per week at the first episode
of CMV reactivation (9). We believe that, in addition to the
viral DNA load, the kinetics of the DNA load and the pat-
tern of changes in the viral load are crucial and should be ta-
ken into consideration when making treatment decisions.
Further study to correct present cutoff value and to validate
the optimal cutoff value for the initiation of preemptive ther-
apy is currently underway at our HSCT center. On the other
hand, we thought that high negative predictive value (87.9%
in the high risk group and 96.5% in the low risk group) could
allow us to avoid unnecessary preemptive therapy with a fair
aliquot of patients. Additionally, we suggested that the dura-
tion of preemptive therapy might be shortened by RQ-PCR
guided manner, because more rapid negative conversion of
viral reactivation was detected using RQ-PCR as previously
reported (27).
In summary, we observed a correlation between the pp65
antignemia assay and the viral load estimated by RQ-PCR
in this study. Additionally, we realized that anti-CMV ther-
apy might influence the results of the two assays. Based on a
comparison with the established antigenemia assay, the ten-
tative threshold at which preemptive anti-CMV therapy ini-
tiated was determined. The quantification of CMV DNA load
from whole blood using RQ-PCR appears to be applicable
to the clinical practice. An optimal cutoff value for guiding
timely preemptive therapy should be clinically validated in
