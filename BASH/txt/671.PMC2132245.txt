(Received for publication, December 9, 1932)
The various anemias and leukemias with consequent anemia present
material of especial interest for a study of this character. Biological
assay of this human liver material shows high values for primary and
aplastic anemias but low normal values for the secondary anemias due
to loss of blood as well as for leukemias. A number of interesting
points emerge from a study of this material and call for discussion.
Pernicious anemia at the present time is being subjected to intensive
scrutiny by the physiologist, chemist and clinician and considerable
progress is being made toward a more complete understanding of this
disease. The findings tabulated below will be surprising or not,
depending upon the conception which the reader may hold relating
to the pathogenesis of pernicious anemia. On the basis of anatomical
findings it was suggested (3) more than 10 years ago that pernicious
anemia could be explained best as due to some lack of unknown mate-
rial which might be responsible for red cell stroma production. It was
pointed out that everywhere there was a large excess of pigment mate-
rial in the red cells, body fluids and tissues, but this pigment material
could not be used because of this lack of some essential factor. At the
time this suggestion was made, the general belief in some unknown
toxic substance responsible for the anemia was almost universal.
The tabulated data (Table 31) below give support to this hypothesis
and show a definite excess of hemoglobin building factors stored in the
liver in pernicious anemia in spite of the fact that death may be due
to lack of red cells and hemoglobin. Surely there is a maximal
stimulus for the production of red cells and hemoglobin but some
essential keystone is missing and the other building stones cannot be
671
672 HEMOGLOBIN :FACTORS IN HUMAN LIVER. III
used. This also explains the well known fact that recovery and hemo-
globin reconstruction are so spectacular in pernicious anemia when this
missing factor is supplied--a large surplus of all other needed building
materials being at hand. By contrast the recovery from secondary
anemia is much slower as all these building materials must be pro-
duced within the body largely from food intake and this may consume
a good deal of time.
Richter, Ivy and Kim (2) have made interesting observations relat-
ing to the liver in pernicious anemia. They find that the liver in an
untreated case of pernicious anemia contained no factors which are
abundant in the normal liver and promote a remission in human cases
of pernicious anemia. Also the treated pernicious anemia case con-
tains in its liver the material which promotes a remission in another
case of pernicious anemia.
Aplastic anemia is due to lack of red bone marrow to furnish needed
red cells. What causes the red marrow to shrivel to a mere remnant
is not known. In this disease it is observed (Table 32) that the liver
stores excess of hemoglobin building material and this is not surprising
as there is no outlet for this material.
In secondary anemia we expected to find that these hemoglobin
factors were much reduced if not almost completely exhausted. Much
to our surprise it was found (Table 33) that in anemia due to loss of
blood the liver contained a low normal concentration of these hemo-
globin producing factors. This is true for man (Table 33) and for
the horse (unpublished data) and therefore probably applies to other
warm blooded animals.
Secondary anemia due to blood destruction within the body may
present a different picture. The last case in Table 33 illustrates this
point but more observations are needed. It is not surprising that the
liver stores iron and hemoglobin producing factors when red cells are
being destroyed in the body.
Leukemia is almost always associated with more or less anemia, the
terminal hemoglobin figures being about 3040 per cent of normal.
Sometimes blood transfusions with or without bleeding will modify
the picture. When one examines the bone marrow it is not difficult
to visualize the anemia as due to marrow disturbance. The red cell
producing chain of cells in the marrow is crowded by the great mass
G. H. WHIPPLE AND F. S. ROBSCHEIT-ROBBINS 673
of white cells and its function probably impaired. Biological assay
shows that the leukemic liver and the liver of secondary anemia stand
about on a par, estimated per gram gross liver weight. There is no
evidence that these abnormal white cells which infiltrate the leukemic
liver and increase its weight contribute any conspicuous amount of
hemoglobin producing factors. If we say that these white cells
"dilute" the potency of the liver cells, the figures for the leukemic liver
potency would rise to normal.
The iron analyses deserve particular attention. The cases of
secondary anemia due to bleeding show very low values (5.3 rag.
per cent) as is to be expected and this is in harmony with the experi-
ments in animals recently reported (1). Leukemia shows about the
normal iron content but if we allow for the large size of the liver the
actual liver parenchyma may contain a little more iron than the normal
human control. The iron analyses for primary and aplastic anemias
are very high (5-10 times normal) and we may believe this is a storage
of material of use for hemoglobin construction but in these diseases
there is no outlet for this material in normal hemoglobin production.
The figures are higher in aplastic anemia than in primary anemia which
is evidence against hemoglobin destruction being a large factor in
primary anemia. The iron concentration in pernicious anemia drops
rapidly with specific liver therapy.

674 HEMOGLOBIN ]~ACTORS IN HUMAN LIVER. III
Histological specimen--the liver cells in general stain well and contain a finely
granular yellow pigment which in part gives a positive stain for iron. This pig-
ment is more conspicuous in the central part of the lobules. In a few lobules are
noted small central necroses. The Kupffer cells show very little pigment.
X-2479. Pernicious anemia--pyelonephritis--no information about liver therapy
--75 yrs.
Liver--autopsy weight 1500 gm.--laboratory specimen 1350 gm.
Histological specimen--central necroses are conspicuous and occupy perhaps 1/5
of the liver lobule. The liver cells in the peripheral 1/2 of the lobule are normal.
There is abundant fine granular yellow pigment giving a strong iron stain in these
liver cells. Kupffer cells contain no pigment.
A-1472. Pernicious anemia--subdural hemorrhage--hemoglobin 30-40 per cent--
68 yrs.
Liver--autopsy weight 1260 gm.--laboratory specimen 1100 gm.
Histological specimen--liver cells almost normal. There is some finely granular
yellow pigment but very little of this gives a stain for iron. Kupffer ceils contain
fine pigment granules which stain sharply for iron. This case had liver extract
for 10 days with the usual blood improvement and this explains some of the pig-
ment lack in liver and kidney.
A-425. Pernicious anemia---senility--hemoglobin 30 per cent--78 yrs.
Patient in Hospital May 25, 1927--hemoglobin 25 per cent--and improved on
treatment. Left Hospital August 12, 1927--hemoglobin 65 per cent. Read-
mitted in moribund state and died in 24 hrs.--no therapy for over 1 mo.
Liver--laboratory specimen 1050 gin.
Histological specimen--liver cells in general normal. Few large fat droplets in
periportal liver cells, some atrophy, lipochrome moderate. Kupffer cells numerous
and full of iron-containing pigment.
A-1122. Pernicious anemia--hemoglobin 30-80 per cent--pulmonary emboli--
75 yrs.
Liver--autopsy weight 1000 gm.--laboratory specimen 930 gin.
Histological specimen--liver cells in general are normal except for fine granular
yellow pigment in their protoplasm. Kupffer cells show similar pigment grains
in small amount. Some of this pigment gives a stain for iron. A few liver cells
show fat droplets. This case had been benefited by liver therapy and at death
the hemoglobin was 80 per cent.
A-1173. Pernicious anemia--hemoglobin 25 per cent--bronchopneumonia--no
liver therapy during last 6 months of life--24 hrs. in hospital--74 yrs.
Liver--laboratory specimen 1130 gm.
G. H. WHIPPLE AND 1~. S. ROBSCHEIT-ROBBINS 675
Histologicalspecimen--liver cellsin generalare normal. There is abundant lipo-
chromepigment but no iron staining pigment within the liver epithelium. There
is iron staining pigment in the Kupffer cells. This lack of pigment is probably
due to precedingliver therapy and blood improvement l0 mos. beforedeath.
Table 31 contains 8 cases of primary pernicious anemia in which
various amounts of liver therapy had been given during life. The
first case (A-371) is of especial significance as this man had had no liver
therapy at any time and presented the classical picture of pernicious
anemia which is very rarely seen today. The iron analyses show
maximal figures (162 rag. per cent) as does the biological assay for liver

potency (420 per cent) and this great excess of iron is a factor in this
high figure for hemoglobin production. In the various tables given
in these papers, a biological assay for liver potency above 300 per cent
is unusual and figures above 400 per cent have been observed only
twice--one case of thyrotoxicosis (Table 4, Paper I) and this case
of primary anemia.
No liver therapy in the final relapse is recorded in 2 other cases
(A-1800 and A-1173). In these cases liver therapy had been given in
earlier periods but not during the last few weeks or months preceding
death from a relapse. The liver analyses for iron exclusive of Case
676 HEMOGLOBIN fACTORS IN I-I-tFM.AN LIVER. III
A-371 show an average of 33 mg. per cent or about 3 times normal and
the liver values for hemoglobin production factors are high. The
lowest value in hemoglobin production factors appears in Case
X-2479 (Table 31) which was complicated by a pyelonephritis which
caused death. It is probable that this acute condition would reduce
somewhat the content of hemoglobin producing factors in the liver--
compare Tables 3 and 4 (Paper I).
In a comparative study of the cases in Table 31 we must keep in
mind that all these cases show senile atrophy and the normal mean
for this type of case is given in Table 2 (Paper I) as 117 per cent which
contrasts with 218 per cent in Table 31. If we exclude the unusual
figure in the first case, the average value for hemoglobin producing
factors is 182 per cent. Even if we choose to explain some of this
difference in potency on the basis of the contained iron we have an
excess coming from unknown factors stored within the liver par-
enchyma cells. We assume that this excess represents building stones
which are suitable for hemoglobin construction in the normal body
but have no outlet in primary anemia.

Table 32 shows 4 typical cases of aplastic anemia. Many trans-
fusions had been given in the first 2 cases and this may explain in part
the very high values for iron (78 and 105 rag. per cent). These high
iron values will explain a part of the large excess of hemoglobin pro-
duction observed in these cases. Moreover we should remember that
this group represents a lower age period and consequently the normal
base line should be 160 per cent (compare Table 1) for accurate control.
When we make these allowances the aplastic anemias are not as much

above normal by biological assay of the hemoglobin producing factors
as is true for pernicious anemia. It may be argued that aplastic
anemia does not last as long as primary anemia and that the liver
therefore does not accumulate as large a surplus store as is true for
pernicious anemia. In both cases there is no outlet for this hemo-
globin production material--in primary anemia due to deficiency fac-
tors and in aplastic anemia due to lack of red marrow parent cells.

from body.
680 HEMOGLOBIN FACTORS IN HUMAN LIVER. III
Table 33 shows 9 cases of severe secondary anemia due to loss of
blood and one case due to blood destruction within the body. Bio-
logical assay of the hemoglobin production factors in these 10 cases
shows low normal values (135 per cent) and if we exclude the single
case of hemolytic anemia, the average for the 9 cases of anemia due
to loss of blood from the body is 126 per cent. This shows how tena-
ciously the liver cell holds to these hemoglobin production factors
even in the face of a long continued severe anemia due to loss of blood.
In contrast the iron analyses show that the normal iron store is
considerably reduced by this type of anemia. The normal iron value
(12 mg. per cent) contrasts with 5.3 mg. per cent, the average for 9
cases of secondary anemia (Table 33) due to loss of blood. These
figures are not quite accurate because of blood contained in the capil-
laries and do not measure accurately the iron contained within the
liver cells. They are in general accord with accurate figures obtained
from blood free liver tissue in dogs (1) which show that about 10 weeks
of severe anemia due to bleeding will reduce liver parenchyma iron
to an irreducible minimum of 4-5 mg. per cent.
The case of hemolytic anemia due to rheumatism--A-1618, Table
33--as expected shows a high figure for iron (23 mg. per cent) and for
liver content of hemoglobin producing factors 217 per cent. The red
cells were destroyed within the body and this salvaged material stored
in part in the liver.

Table 34 shows 15 cases of leukemia representing all types of the
disease. There is one case of myeloma which perhaps does not belong
in this group but at least the biological assay of liver potency falls
close to the general average so that no harm is done. Biological assay
of the hemoglobin producing factors shows a low normal figure (126
per cent) which corresponds to the assay of cases of secondary anemia
(Table 33). The great majority of these cases are acute with large
684 HEMOGLOBIN ]FACTORS IN HLrM_AN LIVER. III
numbers of parent or undifferentiated cells in the blood, marrow and
viscera. Two cases of chronic lymphoid leukemia show low values by
biological assay (57 and 84 per cent). We have no explanation for
these low figures.
The anemia in leukemia would seem to depend upon marrow insuffi-
ciency due to encroachment of the white cells on the red cell chain.
There is little or no evidence for blood destruction as the iron analyses
are close to normal.

Table 35 contains cases of unusual interest which do not seem to fit
in any of the tables given above. Each case deserves a special note.
Thalasemia (A-1367) is a term which we have used to designate a
peculiar familial anemia found in races about the Mediterranean first
described adequately by Cooley and recently from this laboratory (4).
This disease presents some features resembling pernicious anemia and
hemochromatosis. There are large deposits of iron-containing pig-
ments in the liver, pancreas, viscera and ductless glands. It is not
surprising that there should be a high potency for hemoglobin produc-
tion in the liver assay--308 per cent. One should however contrast a
typical case of hemochromatosis (A-1819) with more than twice the
686 HEMOGLOBIN FACTORS IN HUMAN LIVER. III
daily iron intake and half the hemoglobin output. Here is a conspicu-
ous dissociation of the iron factors and the hemoglobin production
factors in two livers which have many similarities.
The third case (A-526) presented diagnostic difficulties. At first it
was classed as a chronic lymphatic leukemia of atypical type but sub-
sequently there was evidence of marrow aplasia which was confirmed
at autopsy. The biological assay of hemoglobin producing factors
(65 per cent) would put it in the group of chronic leukemias whereas
the iron analyses (68 rag. per cent) suggest aplastic anemia. We pre-
fer not to attempt to classify this case at the present time.
Chloroformpoisoning (4th case, A-1785) is unusual in many ways.
We expected a very low value for the hemoglobin producing factors as
the patient died from chloroform injury of liver with low fibrinogen,
bleeding and all the essential features of this condition. Moreover
the liver shows histological injury of extreme grade. Yet there is
abundant material in the abnormal liver tissue from which the normal
amount of hemoglobin is produced (159 per cent). It is suggested
that these unknown factors remain even in these dead and injured
cells as the process was acute and the injured cells have not yet auto-
lyzed and been removed as follows repair in chloroform poisoning.
The acuteness of the injury differentiates this type of case from the
other type of hepatic insufficiency and liver injury given in Table
25 (Paper II).
Eclampsiapresents an unusual observation (A-62, Table 35). Only
one other case (Table 21, Paper II) with severe passive congestiongives
zero value for hemoglobin production factors. We cannot correlate
these two observations but subsequent findings in eclampsia would be
of interest.
The last case (A-1261, Table 35) is of considerable interest because
it suggests that lactation may reduce the store of hemoglobin produc-
ing factors in the normal liver. There is some evidence that material
which can be used to build hemoglobin in an emergency (anemia) may
be used to build up and replace plasma protein or tissue protein when
needed. The production of milk protein might come into this same
group. We have long suspected that it might be possible to show
experimentally that building materials coming to the liver might be
used for one important product (hemoglobin) at one time and again for
G. H. WHIPPLE AND F. S. ROBSCttEIT-ROBBINS 687
another different but related substance under different demand or
emergencyconditions. We hope to obtain further information about
lactation and the storage of these potent hemoglobin producing factors
in the liver.
SLrM-MARY
Biological assay of the human liver in various types of anemia shows
conspicuous differences in the concentration of hemoglobin producing
factors.
Pernicious anemia shows very high values and the liver in untreated
cases may show maximal storage of the hemoglobin producing factors.
Liver therapy reduces this store as the missing factor is supplied and
new hemoglobin and red cells can be turned out by the marrow.
Aplastic anemia likewise shows high concentration of hemoglobin
producing factors as there is no outlet for this material through the
red marrow.
Secondary anemia due to loss of blood will show low normal values
but even long standing severe anemia will not seriously deplete this
store of hemoglobin producing factors in the liver.
Secondary anemia due to blood destruction within the body shows
higher values and some excess store of hemoglobin producing factors
and iron.
Leukemia gives a biological assay like secondary anemia due to
blood loss and always presents definite anemia.
Iron analyses show conspicuous differences and iron concentration
within the liver parenchyma does not in any way parallel the con-
centration of hemoglobin producing factors. The highest values for
iron concentration are found in aplastic anemia (70 mg. per cent)--
high values in pernicious anemia (51 rag. per cent)--normal values in
leukemia (13 rag. per cent)--and low values in anemia due to loss of
blood (5.3 rag. per cent).
These findings should aid in a more complete understanding of the
pathogenesis and internal metabolism of various anemias.
