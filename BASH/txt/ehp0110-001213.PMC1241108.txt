Benzene is commonly used to synthesize
organic chemicals and is an important com-
ponent of many organic solvents. Workers
exposed to benzene may potentially suffer
chronic benzene poisoning (BP). Clinical
reports have shown that exposure to benzene
can result in a variety of blood and bone mar-
row disorders, including leukopenia, anemia,
myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia,
acute myeloid leukemia, and acute lympho-
cytic leukemia (Aksoy et al. 1972; Linet et al.
1996; Yin et al. 1987).
Previous studies have indicated that ben-
zene toxicity mainly results from its intermedi-
ate reactive metabolites (Irons and Stillman
1996; Kolachana et al. 1993). Benzene is ini-
tially oxidized to benzene oxide by hepatic
CYP2E1 in the liver (Koop et al. 1989;
Valentine et al. 1996). Benzene oxide forms
phenol spontaneously or conjugates with glu-
tathione to form less toxic or nontoxic
derivates via glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs).
Phenol is catalyzed by CYP2E1 to potentially
toxic di- or trihydroxybenzenes such as hydro-
quinone, catechol, and 1,2,4-benzentriol
(Eastmond et al. 1987; Smith et al. 1989;
Subrahmanyam et al. 1991). The di- or trihy-
droxy metabolites are further oxidized in the
bone marrow by myeloperoxidase (MPO) to
benzoquinones (Schattenberg et al. 1994), a
potent hematotoxic and genotic agent, which
can be detoxified by NAD(P)H:quinone
oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) to less harmful
hydroxybenzenes (Joseph et al. 2000; Ross et
al. 1996). Thus we hypothesized that the deﬁ-
cient or altered activity of enzymes involved in
benzene metabolism such as CYP2E1, MPO,
NQO1, and GSTs would signiﬁcantly affect
susceptibility to benzene toxicity.
Genetic polymorphisms in genes encod-
ing CYP2E1, MPO, NQO1, and GSTs
(Hirvonen et al. 1993; Piedraﬁta et al. 1996;
Puga et al. 1997; Traver et al. 1997) might be
responsible for human susceptibility to BP
because they might have an effect on enzyme
activity. NQO1 with a C-to-T substitution in
cDNA at nucleotide 609 (NQO1 c.609C>T
variation) causes reduced or lost enzyme activ-
ity (Traver et al. 1992). A case–control study
revealed that workers exposed to benzene with
both the higher CYP2E1 enzyme activity and
the NQO1 c.609 T/T genotype had a 7.6-fold
increased risk of BP (Rothman et al. 1997).
A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in
an Alu repeat in the MPO gene promoter,
c.–463G>A, could decrease the expression of
MPO by destroying an SP1 transcriptional
factor binding site (Piedraﬁta et al. 1996). It
has been reported that the GSTT1 null geno-
type increased susceptibility to myelodysplas-
tic syndrome [odds ratio (OR) = 4.3] (Chen
et al. 1996), although confirmation of this
ﬁnding is needed.
Most chronic and complex diseases are
caused by interactions among environment,
genes, and lifestyle (Mucci et al. 2001). We
conducted a case–control study to explore the
effects of polymorphisms in genes involved in
benzene metabolism on human susceptibility
to BP and to explore the potential effect of
lifestyle modiﬁcation on BP. Our results indi-
cated that NQO1 c.609C>T variation and
lifestyle contributed to the risks of BP, and
the combined effect of NQO1 c.609 T/T,
CYP2E1 c.–1293 C/C and c.–1293 G/C,
and the GSTT1 null genotype significantly
increased the risk of BP.
Materials and Methods
Subjects. The workers with BP who enrolled in
this study came from Shanghai, Hangzhou,
Maanshan, and Guangzhou, China, where
clusters of cases were reported. Benzene poi-
soning was diagnosed from 1980 to 1998 by
the local authorized Occupational Disease
Diagnostic Team, and patients were registered
in the hospitals of prevention and treatment
for occupational diseases, which cooperated
with us. The diagnostic criteria for occupa-
tional BP, according to the Ministry of Health,
China, include a) total white blood cell count
< 4,000/µL or white blood cell count between
4,000 and 4,500/µL and platelet count

Articles
Metabolic enzymes involved in benzene activation or detoxification, including NAD(P)H,
quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), myeloperoxidase (MPO),
glutathione-S-transferase mu-1 (GSTM1), and glutathione-S-transferase theta-1 (GSTT1), were
studied for their roles in human susceptibility to benzene poisoning. The potential interactions of
these metabolic enzymes with lifestyle factors such as cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption
were also explored. We studied 156 benzene-poisoning patients and 152 workers occupationally
exposed to benzene in South China. Sequencing, denaturing HPLC, restriction fragment-length
polymorphism, and polymerase chain reaction were used to detect polymorphisms on the promot-
ers and complete coding regions of NQO1, CYP2E1, MPO, and the null genotypes of GSTM1
and GSTT1. Seventeen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in NQO1,
CYP2E1, and MPO genes, including 6 novel SNPs in CYP2E1 and MPO. Of the subjects who
smoked and drank alcohol, an 8.15-fold [95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 1.43–46.50] and a 21.50-
fold (95% CI, 2.79–165.79) increased risk of benzene poisoning, respectively, were observed
among the subjects with two copies of NQO1 with a C-to-T substitution in cDNA at nucleotide
609 (c.609 C>T variation; i.e., NQO1 c.609 T/T) compared to those with the heterozygous or
wild (NQO1 c.609 C/T and c.609 C/C) genotypes. Our data also indicated that individuals with
CYP2E1 c.–1293 C/C and c.–1293 G/C, and NQO1 c.609 T/T, and GSTT1 null genotypes
tended to be more susceptible to benzene toxicity. Our results suggest that the combined effect of
polymorphisms in NQO1, CYP2E1, and GSTT1 genes and lifestyle factors might contribute to
benzene poisoning. Key words: benzene poisoning, polymorphisms, lifestyle, NQO1, CYP2E1, MPO,

< 80,000/µL, with repeated confirmation of
this count in a few months in a peripheral
blood examination; b) the individual with doc-
umented benzene exposure has been employed
for at least 6 months in the factory; and
c) exclusion of other causes of abnormal blood
counts such as chloromycetin use and ionizing
radiation. The medical records of patients were
independently reviewed, especially those with
white blood cell counts > 3,500 to conﬁrm the
BP diagnosis. Of the 171 eligible patients, 156
(91%) agreed to participate in this study.
About 72% of BP patients (112 patients) were
from Shanghai Second Fabric Machine
Factory (19 patients), Hangzhou Tool
Machine Factory (13), Maanshan Iron & Steel
Group (68), and Guangzhou Piano-Making
Factory (12). Another 44 patients, who
returned to the hospital periodically for health
examinations, were from 12 other factories
that had been closed down. BP cases from the
factories registered in the hospitals were also
clustered (more than ﬁve reports).
We chose 152 workers in the four major
factories, who had been occupationally
exposed to benzene, as controls. Control sub-
jects were frequency-matched to cases by age
within 5 years, exposure duration within 3
years, exposure level, and sex. All the eligible
controls agreed to participate in this study.
The subjects were interviewed by trained
personnel, and a questionnaire was used to
obtain general information including ethnic
background, nutrition, cigarette smoking,
alcohol consumption, protective measures,
self-reported symptoms, medical history, and
occupational history such as work unit (depart-
ment), type of work, and exposure duration.
Exposure estimation was based on monitoring
data or industrial hygienists and long-term
employees’ evaluation considering historical
changes (Dosemeci et al. 1996). The intensity
of benzene exposure (milligrams per cubic
meter) for the patients was taken as the benzene
level of workplaces while diagnoses were made;
the intensity of benzene exposure in controls
was taken as the current level monitored by
organic vapor passive dosimetry badges during
collection of the blood samples from controls.
Those who smoked at least one cigarette per
day for more than 1 year were considered regu-
lar smokers. Alcohol consumption was deﬁned
as drinking at least 7 standard units of alcohol
on average per week [1 standard unit = 10 g of
alcohol equivalent; e.g., a glass/can/bottle (330
mL) of regular beer (5%), a measure (40 mL)
of liquor, a glass (120 mL) of wine] for more
than 6 months. The subjects were adminis-
trated a rigorous physical examination at a
local occupational disease hospital. Alanine
aminotransferase level in serum was examined
to indicate liver function.
Collection of blood samples. Blood sam-
ples of the subjects enrolled in this study
were collected only after informed consent
was obtained. Blood was immediately frozen
at –80° after collection and was sent to the
laboratory later in dry ice.
Amplification of DNA samples. We
extracted genomic DNA from blood samples
by a routine phenol-chloroform method. We
performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
using 50 ng of genomic DNA, 0.2 µM of each
primer, 100 µM dNTPs, 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH
8.8), 10 mM KCl, 1.0–1.5 mM MgCl2, and
2.5 U Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA,
USA) in a 25-µL reaction volume. DNA sam-
ples were ampliﬁed for 35 cycles at 94°C for 45
sec, 63°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min. The
primer sequences are listed in Table 1.
Detection of genetic polymorphisms. DNA
sequencing was performed on an Automated
DNA Sequencer ABI 377 (PE Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. We used
the PolyPhred computer program (PolyPhred,
available online) to indicate possible SNP loci.
Verification of each candidate SNP was car-
ried out by visual inspection.
Denaturing HPLC (DHPLC; Kuklin et al.
1997/1998) was carried out on an automated
HPLC equipped with a DNA separation
column (Transgenomic, San Jose, CA, USA).
For NQO1 exon4 and exon6, MPO promoter
and exon 8, and CYP2E1 exon 6, the temper-
ature of the DHPLC column was 63°C,
60°C, 60°C, 63°C, and 58°C; the acetonitrile
gradient was 53–61%, 54–62%, 63–69%,
58–68%, and 52–58%, respectively.
CYP2E1 c.–1293 G>C was analyzed by
PCR-restriction length polymorphism
(RFLP). PCR products were digested by PstI
(MBI, Hanover, MD, USA) at 37°C for 2 hr.
Different length fragments were separated by
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
The null genotype of GSTM1 and GSTT1
(Arand et al. 1996) and 96-bp insertion in the
promoter of CYP2E1 (Fritsche et al. 2000) were
detected by amplifying the target DNA regions
and electrophoresis visualization on agarose gel.
We used albumin as the internal control.
Statistical analyses. Our analysis was
designed to examine the relationships of geno-
types of NQO1, CYP2E1, MPO, GSTM1,
and GSTT1 with the risks of BP controlling
potential confounding factors and evaluate
whether lifestyle factors such as cigarette
smoking and alcohol consumption modiﬁed

the relationships of genotypes with risks of
BP. SPSS 8.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA) was used to set up a database and
analyze data. We used chi-square tests to
examine the association between genetic poly-
morphisms and individual susceptibility to
benzene hematotoxicity. If the value for a cell
was < 5 in the chi-square test, we applied
Fisher’s exact test. To evaluate whether the
lifestyle modified the relationship between
genetic polymorphisms and susceptibility to
BP, we examined the associations by applying
chi-square tests after stratiﬁcation according to
cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption.
The test for homogeneity of ORs was exam-
ined by the Breslow-Day method. The hetero-
geneity of ORs indicated there could be
interaction (p < 0.05). To control potential
confounding factors such as sex, intensity of
benzene exposure, and exposure duration, we
applied unconditional logistic regression to
examine the relations of genetic polymor-
phisms with BP. Two-tailed p-values < 0.05
were considered statistically signiﬁcant. ORs
and 95% conﬁdence intervals (95% CIs) were
calculated to estimate the individual risk of
BP. ORs adjusted for the potential confound-
ing factors are also reported. We also used
multiple-variables unconditional logistic
regression analysis to analyze the data. We
applied stepwise forward logistic regression
selection to screen the covariates including
sex, exposure duration, genetic polymor-
phisms, and interactions among them (crite-
rion for acceptance: p ≤ 0.05; criterion for
removal: p ≥ 0.10). The screened covariates
and intensity of benzene exposure were used
to set up a saturated model.
Results
Demographics of cases and controls. The
distribution of age, sex, exposure duration,
intensity of benzene exposure, type of work,
self-reported symptoms, cigarette smoking,
and alcohol consumption in the cases and
controls is shown in Table 2. The median age
and exposure duration in 156 BP cases was
36.00 (range: 21.00–61.00) and 11.00 (range:
1.00–38.00); 38.50 (range: 19.00–57.00) and
9.00 (range: 1.00–36.00), respectively, in 152
controls. There was no signiﬁcant difference
in the distribution of age (≤ 25, 26–35,
36–45, > 45 years), exposure duration (≤ 5,
6–10, 11–15, 16–20, > 25 years), intensity of
benzene exposure (≤ 40 mg/m3, 41–100
mg/m3, > 100 mg/m3), and sex (p > 0.05).
The percentage of female subjects was much
higher than that of males (60.26% vs. 39.74%
in BP cases and 62.50% vs. 37.50% in
controls). The higher female ratio may also
explain the relatively low frequency of ciga-
rette smoking (17.67%) and alcohol con-
sumption (11.59%) in the subjects. Exposure
duration was highly correlated with age
(Spearman rank correlation, p < 0.05).
Genetic polymorphisms of NQO1,
CYP2E1, MPO, GSTM1, and GSTT1. We
initially screened 24 cases and 24 controls ran-
domly for possible genetic variations in NQO1,
CYP2E1, and MPO genes by direct sequenc-
ing. More than 99% of SNPs with frequencies
≥ 5% will be observed among the normal pop-
ulation [1 – (1 – 5%)48 individuals × 2 chromosomes =
99.27%]. We identiﬁed 17 SNPs by sequenc-
ing in the screened regions of NQO1, CYP2E1,
and MPO and 6 SNPs were genotyped by
DHPLC in all subjects. Two SNPs in MPO
promoter, MPO c.–581T>C and MPO
c.–463G>A were completely linked; thus only
the MPO c.–463G>A was analyzed. The SNPs
on the CYP2E1 promoter region were too
complicated (10 SNPs in 1,000 bp) to be
detected by DHPLC (Table 3). We only deter-
mined 1 of 10 SNPs, CYP2E1 c.–1293G>C,
because the G-to-C transition forms a PstI site.
Table 3 shows the allele and genotype frequen-
cies of polymorphisms on NQO1, CYP2E1,
MPO, GSTM1, and GSTT1 genes. Genotype
frequencies of these genetic polymorphisms cal-
culated from the control group were in Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium, making selection bias
less likely (chi-square test, p > 0.05).

aSNPs were deposited into HGVbase (Human Genome Variation database, available online; Fredman et al. 2002); among
the SNPs, MPO c.–581T>C, MPO c.–25G>A, MPO IVS8 + 19G>A, CYP2E1 c.–1563T>A, CYP2E1 c.–1513T>G, and CYP2E1
c.–1412C>T were novel. bNQO1 c.609C>T is located at the 559 position from the start codon of NQO1 mRNA; we used
NQO1 c.609C>T in this study to be consistent with other papers. cAllele frequency and genotype frequency were calcu-
lated in 48 subjects; others were calculated in all subjects. d+ indicates a 96-bp insertion in one chromosome; – indicates

Effect of genetic polymorphisms of NQO1,
MPO, CYP2E1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 on the
risks of BP. The distribution of eight indepen-
dent polymorphisms of the studied genes was
compared in cases and controls (Table 4). Due
to their small number, some genotypes were
grouped with other genotypes according to pre-
vious reported research on the function on
these genes. No association of genetic polymor-
phisms and susceptibility to risks of BP was
found between BP cases and benzene-exposed
workers (p > 0.05). Although the frequency of
the cases with two copies of NQO1 c.609C>T
variation (NQO1 c.609 T/T genotype) was
slightly higher than that of controls (25.71% vs
19.58%), there was no statistical difference
between them. There was little variation in OR
values when adjusted for sex, exposure dura-
tion, and intensity of benzene exposure.
Relations of genetic polymorphisms of
NQO1, MPO, CYP2E1, GSTM1, and
GSTT1 with the risks of BP modified by
lifestyle. The test for homogeneity (H) of ORs
indicated a possible interaction between
NQO1 c.609 C>T and cigarette smoking/alco-
hol consumption (χH
2 = 5.969, p = 0.015; χH
2
= 6.492, p = 0.011, respectively; χ2 and p-values
adjusted by sex, exposure duration, and inten-
sity of benzene exposure). The subjects were
stratiﬁed according to cigarette smoking. The
frequency of regular smokers with NQO1
c.609 T/T genotypes in BP cases and benzene-
exposed controls was 44.44% and 9.68%,
respectively (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.01; Table
5). Our data showed a 7.73-fold increased risk
of BP for smokers carrying NQO1 c.609 T/T
compared with the those with the heterozygous
or wild type gene (NQO1 c.609 C/T or C/C;
OR = 7.73; 95% CI, 1.71–34.97; Table 5).
Adjustment for sex, exposure duration, inten-
sity of benzene exposure, and alcohol consump-
tion had a minimal impact on the results
(NQO1 c.609C>T; OR = 8.15; 95% CI,
1.43–46.50; Table 5). Compared with the
individuals with the CYP2E1 c.–1293G>C
wild genotype (CYP2E1 c.–1293 G/G), the
smokers carrying CYP2E1 c.–1293 G/C or
C/C genotypes had a 3.30-fold increased risk of
BP (OR = 3.30; 95% CI, 1.02–10.65; Table
5), but no signiﬁcant difference was observed
after adjustment for sex, exposure duration, and
alcohol consumption (p = 0.07). Due to the
small number of smokers in this study (19 cases
and 34 controls), the association of the com-
bined effect of CYP2E1 c.–1293G>C variation
and cigarette smoking with BP should be
explored in a larger sample size.
Among the alcohol drinkers, the frequency
of BP cases with NQO1 c.609 T/T was
61.11%, which was about ﬁve times as much as
that of controls (Table 6). Compared with
those of NQO1 c.609 C/T and C/C genotypes,
the subjects with NQO1 c.609 T/T had an
11.00-fold increase for BP (OR = 11.00; 95%
CI, 1.89–63.86; Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.005),
and this risk increased even higher, to 21.50-
fold, after adjustment for sex, exposure dura-
tion, intensity of benzene exposure, and
cigarette smoking (OR = 21.50; 95% CI,
2.79–165.79). The frequency of the BP cases
with GSTM1 null genotype among the alcohol
drinkers was higher than that of the controls
(66.67% vs. 33.33%), but no signiﬁcant differ-
ence between them was observed in this study.
There was, however, a 4.21-fold increased risk
of BP for the alcohol drinkers with GSTM1
null genotype compared with those with
GSTM1 non-null genotype (Table 6).
Multiple-variables unconditional logistic
regression analysis. The covariates and cross-
product terms examined in the logistic
regression model included intensity of expo-
sure, alcohol, NQO1 c.609C>T, CYP2E1
c.–1293G>C, and GSTT1 genotypes
(Table 7). The model suggested there was a
joint action between alcohol consumption
and NQO1 c.609 C>T variation (p = 0.007)
and among NQO1 c.609 C>T, CYP2E1
c.–1293G>C, and GSTT1 null genotypes (p
= 0.019). We examined the combined effects
by stratiﬁcation according to NQO1, CYP2E1,
and GSTT1 genotypes. The result showed indi-
viduals with NQO1 c.609 T/T, CYP2E1
c.–1293 C/C or C/G, and GSTT1 null geno-
types were more susceptible to BP with a 5.64-
fold increased risk compared with individuals
carrying NQO1 c.609 C/T or C/C, CYP2E1
c.–1293 G/G, and GSTT1 non-null genotypes.
Discussion
By examining the polymorphisms of the pro-
moter and coding regions of NQO1,
CYP2E1, and MPO and the null genotype of
GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes, we studied the
relationship between genetic polymorphism
and the human susceptibility to risks of BP.
The interaction of genetic diversities of these
genes with lifestyle on BP was also explored.
Though no association was suggested
between genetic polymorphisms of these
genes and risks of BP from our study,
Rothman et al. (1997) reported a 2.6-fold
increased risk of BP in the workers with
NQO1 c.609 T/T genotype. There was, how-
ever, an 8.15-fold or 21.50-fold increased risk
of BP in the individuals with NQO1 c.609
T/T genotype compared with NQO1 C/C or
C/T genotypes after stratiﬁcation by cigarette
smoking and alcohol consumption, respec-
tively (Tables 5 and 6). Cigarette smoking
and alcohol consumption were considered
risk factors contributing to many diseases
such as lung cancer and bladder cancer.
Moreover, because benzene is a component of
cigarette smoke, the cumulative exposures of
regular smokers should be higher than those
of nonsmokers who never smoked while
exposed to benzene. Our results suggested
that there might be an association between
NQO1 c.609 T/T genotype and the risks of
BP with modification by cigarette smoking
and alcohol consumption. The C-to-T point
variation of this SNP, which causes a proline

to serine change, is associated with a loss activ-
ity of NQO1 (Traver et al. 1992). Moran et
al. (1999) demonstrated that benzene metabo-
lite hydroquinone induced high levels of
NQO1 activity in bone marrow CD34+ cells
with the wild genotype (NQO1 c.609 C/C),
and noncytotoxic doses of hydroquinone
induced intermediate levels of NQO1 activity
in heterozygous (NQO1 c.609 C/T) cells but
exerted no effect on cells with the NQO1
c.609 T/T genotype. It is possible that failure
to induce functional NQO1 enzyme activity
in NQO1 c.609 T/T individuals might be
responsible for BP.
In addition to the interaction between
genetic polymorphisms and lifestyle, different
genetic polymorphisms could contribute to the
risk of BP. We speculated that individuals with

high-level activity of metabolic enzymes
involved in oxidizing benzene to more toxic
metabolites such as CYP2E1 and low-level
activity of metabolic enzymes participated in
detoxiﬁcation pathway as GSTT1 and GSTM1
were less resistant to benzene toxicity. There
was no detectable enzyme activity in the indi-
viduals with GSTT1 null genotypes. Using an
in vitro transfection system with CAT as a
reporter gene, it has been observed that the RasI
polymorphism, which was completely linked
with PstI in the 5´-flanking sequence of the
CYP2E1 gene, caused a 10-fold increase in
transcription activity compared with the wild
type sequence (Hayashi et al. 1991). However,
another study showed the decreased oral clear-
ance of chlorzoxazone with RasI homozygous
variants in Japanese residents of Hawaii
(Marchand et al. 1999). The higher inducible
enzyme activity was also observed in individuals
with a 96 bp insertion (Ins96+/– and Ins96+/+)
on the CYP2E1 promoter region (McCarver et
al. 1998). Analysis of the combined effects of
various genotype on risks of BP showed that
the individuals with the NQO1 c.609 T/T,
CYP2E1 c.–1293 G/C and C/C, and GSTT1
null genotype had an increased risk of BP with
exposure to benzene (Table 8). The results sug-
gest that individuals with lower NQO1 and
GSTT1 activity and higher CYP2E1 activity
tend to be more susceptible to benzene toxicity.
Joint action between genetic polymor-
phisms and environment on speciﬁc diseases
is complicated. A more comprehensive,
larger scale study should be warranted to
confirm the gene–environment interaction
on susceptibility to BP.
