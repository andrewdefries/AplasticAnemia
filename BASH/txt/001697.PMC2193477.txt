Abstract
Multipotent self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are responsible for reconstitution
of all blood cell lineages. Whereas growth stimulatory cytokines have been demonstrated to
promote HSC self-renewal, the potential role of negative regulators remains elusive. Receptors
for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and Fas ligand have been implicated as regulators of steady-
state hematopoiesis, and if overexpressed mediate bone marrow failure. However, it has been
proposed that hematopoietic progenitors rather than stem cells might be targeted by Fas activa-
tion. Here, murine LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ stem cells revealed little or no constitutive expression of
Fas and failed to respond to an agonistic anti-Fas antibody. However, if induced to undergo
self-renewal in the presence of TNF-␣, the entire short and long-term repopulating HSC pool
acquired Fas expression at high levels and concomitant activation of Fas suppressed in vitro
growth of LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells cultured at the single cell level. Moreover, LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ
stem cells undergoing self-renewal divisions in vitro were severely and irreversibly compro-
mised in their short- and long-term multilineage reconstituting ability if activated by TNF-␣
or through Fas, providing the first evidence for negative regulators of HSC self-renewal.

Introduction
Self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)* are re-
sponsible for replenishing all blood cell lineages through
life. Although representing only 1 in 10,000 bone marrow
(BM) cells, sophisticated methods have been developed to
isolate HSCs to high purity (1), allowing meaningful stud-
ies of candidate stem cells in vitro. However, HSCs cannot
be purified to homogeneity, and must thus ultimately be
identified through their unique ability to long-term multi-
lineage reconstitute ablated recipients (1).
Hematopoiesis is regulated in part by a large number of
hematopoietic growth factors supporting proliferation, dif-
ferentiation, and survival of hematopoietic cells at different
levels of differentiation (2, 3). Most evidence support that
the primary role of such cytokines in early hematopoiesis is
to prevent programmed cell death, rather than to induce
programs for growth and differentiation (4–7).
Much less is known about the potential role of negative
regulators in hematopoiesis (8–11). Receptors for TNF-␣
and Fas ligand have been implicated to be involved in sup-
pressing hematopoiesis. A growth-inhibitory effect of
TNF-␣ in early murine hematopoiesis is supported by in
vitro studies of purified primitive murine progenitors (11,
12), but it has not been investigated whether this is associ-
ated with a negative or positive effect on HSC function.
Studies in TNF receptor–deficient mice have suggested that
the number of phenotypically defined (LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ)
stem cells is increased (11). However, more recent studies
D. Bryder and V. Ramsfjell contributed equally to this work.

942 Fas and TNF-␣ Targeting of Hematopoietic Stem Cells
have shown that this increase does not necessarily correlate
with enhanced in vivo HSC function (13), emphasizing
that true long-term repopulating cells (LTRCs) only can be
evaluated through their unique ability to long-term multi-
lineage reconstitute conditioned recipients in vivo (1, 14).
Fas has been implicated to play a role in regulation of
myelopoiesis and as a potential tumor suppressor of my-
eloid leukemic development (10). However, the status of
its expression and potential function on HSC remains elu-
sive. Fas-mediated apoptosis of committed myeloid pro-
genitors has been demonstrated to be involved in the my-
elosuppression associated with acute graft versus host
disease (GVHD; reference 9). Accumulating evidence also
support a role of TNF-␣ and Fas in a number of chronic
disorders of blood cell formation associated with enhanced
apoptosis (15–22). However, as candidate murine BM stem
cells, unlike myeloid progenitors, have been reported to
lack expression of cell surface Fas (10, 23), HSCs have been
suggested to represent unlikely targets for Fas-induced BM
suppression.
We have recently, through HSC division tracking and
serial transplantation experiments, demonstrated that mu-
rine LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ long-term reconstituting stem cells
can undergo multiple self-renewing divisions in vitro (24,
25). Others and we have demonstrated that this self-
renewal process is positively affected by cytokines such as
IL-3, IL-6, IL-11, c-kit ligand, and thrombopoietin (24–27).
Thus, this allowed us to investigate how TNF-␣ and Fas
might potentially affect HSC self-renewal.
In these studies we demonstrate that purified LinϪ
Sca1ϩc-kitϩ repopulating BM stem cells (28–30) have little
or no constitutive expression of Fas and fail to respond to
an agonistic anti-Fas antibody. However, TNF-␣ effi-
ciently induces Fas expression and responsiveness of cycling
LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ HSCs, resulting in severely compromised
ability to short- and long-term multilineage reconstitute
the hematopoietic system.
Materials and Methods
Hematopoietic Growth Factors and Antibodies. Recombinant rat
(rr) KL (stem cell factor) and recombinant human (rh) G-CSF
were provided by Amgen Corp. (Thousand Oaks, CA). Recom-
binant murine (rm) IL-3 was from PeproTech. rhIL-6 was a gift
from Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). rmTNF-␣ was sup-
plied by Genentech (San Francisco, CA) and rh flt3 ligand (FL)
was a gift from Immunex (Seattle, WA). Unless otherwise indi-
cated, all cytokines were used at the following predetermined op-
timal concentrations: rrKL and rhIL-6: both at 50 ng/ml; rmIL-3
and rmTNF-␣: 20 ng/ml. When a cocktail of KL plus IL-3 plus
IL-6 plus FL plus G-CSF was used, the concentrations of the cy-
tokines were 25 ng/ml, except for IL-3 which was used at 10 ng/
ml. Purified monoclonal hamster anti–mouse Fas antibody (Jo2)
and irrelevant isotype-matched hamster IgG antibody (both from
BD PharMingen) were used at 0.2 to 0.5 ␮g/ml, based on initial
titration experiments showing similar growth-inhibitory effects of
Jo2 at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.5 ␮g/ml. Jo2 as well as the isotype-
matched antibody contained no sodium azide and low endotoxin
levels (Յ0.01 ng/␮g of protein).
Enrichment and Purification of LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ Murine BM
Cells. All animal procedures were performed with consent from
the local ethics committee at Lund University. Lineage-depleted
(LinϪ) BM cells were isolated from normal 6–14-wk-old
C57BL/6 mice (CD45.2), congenic B6.SJL-PtprcaPepb/BoyJ
(CD45.1), or Fas-deficient (lpr) mice inbred to C57BL/6 back-
ground (B6.MRL-Fas&lt;lpr&gt mice; CD45.2) according to
previously described protocols (24, 25, 30, 31). When phenotyp-
ing or sorting LinϪSca1ϩckitϩCD34Ϫ HSCs, donor mice were
always 12–14 wk old, as it has been shown that HSCs from
younger mice are mostly CD34ϩ (32, 33). HSC populations were
isolated as described previously (24) and sorted on a FACSVan-
tage™ (Becton Dickinson). Reanalysis of sorted cells reproduc-
ibly showed a purity of 96–99%.
Limiting Dilution Assay. LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells were seeded in
Terasaki plates (Nunc) at a density of 1 cell/well in 20 ␮l IMDM
(BioWhittaker) supplemented with 20% FCS (BioWhittaker)
containing 100 U/ml penicillin (BioWhittaker), 100 U/ml strep-
tomycin (BioWhittaker), 2 mM L-glutamine (BioWhittaker), 0.1
mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), and various cytokines.
Wells were scored for cell growth following 10–12 d of incuba-
tion at 37ЊC in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in air. In
some experiments, cells were deposited by a single cell depositor
coupled to a FACSVantage™ (Becton Dickinson), and subse-
quently carefully visualized by microscopy to only include wells
containing a single cell. The cytokine response pattern was simi-
lar with these two methods.
Semisolid Clonogenic Assay. LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells were plated
in duplicates in 1 ml IMDM supplemented with 20% FCS, 1.2%
(final concentrations) methylcellulose (Methocel™; Fluka Che-
mie), and cytokines at predetermined optimal concentrations in
35-mm Petri dishes. Cultures were incubated at 37ЊC in a hu-
midified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in air for 10–12 d, at which
time colonies (Ͼ50 cells) were visualized and scored with an in-
verted microscope.
Flow Cytometric Analysis. Cell surface phenotypings was per-
formed on freshly isolated LinϪ BM cells or LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ
cells, incubated for different periods of time with cytokines at
predetermined optimal concentrations in a serum-free medium:
X-Vivo 15™ (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 1% detoxified
BSA (StemCell Technologies, Inc.), 100 U/ml penicillin (Bio-
Whittaker), 100 U/ml streptomycin (BioWhittaker), 2 mM
L-glutamine (BioWhittaker), and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol
(Sigma-Aldridge) or in IMDM supplemented as described for
the limiting dilution assay above. Cells were stained with a
monoclonal hamster anti–mouse Fas (Jo2) PE-conjugated anti-
body (BD PharMingen), and monoclonal rat anti–mouse anti-
bodies against CD34 (FITC), Sca1 (biotin, FITC, or PE), c-kit
(allophycocyanin [APC]), TNF receptors p55 and p75 (biotin;
HyCult Biotechnology), and lineage-specific antigens (FITC-
conjugated or purified antibodies detected with a secondary
goat anti–rat PE-Tricolor™ antibody; Caltag): B220, Gr-1,
Mac-1, CD8, CD4, and Ter-119 (all BD PharMingen). Cells
were incubated with antibodies for 15–20 min on ice after
blocking unspecific binding with hamster IgG (Jackson Immu-
noResearch Laboratories) or Fc block (purified CD16/CD32
monoclonal antibody; BD PharMingen). Cells were washed, in-
cubated with Streptavidin-PE (BD PharMingen), -PerCP (Bec-
ton Dickinson), or -CyChrome™ (BD PharMingen) to visual-
ize biotin-conjugated antibodies, and washed again. Finally,
cells were analyzed for forward light scatter, orthogonal light
scatter, and the four fluorescence signals on a FACSCalibur™
(Becton Dickinson). Flow cytometry analysis was performed us-

Inc.) software.
Detection of TNFR-p55 and TNFR-p75 Transcripts. LinϪ
Scaϩkitϩ34Ϫ cells were subjected to global mRNA amplifi-
cation and subsequent Southern analysis essentially as described
previously (34, 35). Briefly, 25 LinϪScaϩkitϩ34Ϫ cells were trans-
ferred into PCR tubes using an automated micromanipulator de-
vice. Subsequently, cells were lysed in first strand buffer followed
by reverse transcription (RT) of mRNA using an oligo(dT)-
primer. In a second step the first strand cDNA was polyadenyl-
ated by terminal transferase to generate a 5Ј-oligo(dT)-tran-
script-poly(A)-3Ј cDNA that finally was amplified by PCR using
a sequence independent X-(dT)24 primer. The resulting cDNA (2
␮g) was run on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon mem-
brane by capillary blotting and fixed by UV irradiation. Probes
used for Southern hybridization were generated by PCR from se-
quence verified EST clones (TNFR-p75 GenBank/EMBL/
DDBJ accession no. BE635232, forward primer 5Ј-AGG CTG
CCA TAC CTG CCC-3Ј, reverse primer 5Ј-GGT ATG TGA
GTG TGT GTG C-3Ј; TNFR-p55 GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ ac-
cession no. AI267050, forward primer 5Ј-AGC CGC CGA GGA
CTG CC-3Ј, reverse primer 5Ј-AGA GTC GAG GGC TCC
AGC-3Ј). Probes (50 ng) were radiolabeled with 32P-dCTP
(Random Primers DNA labeling system; GIBCO BRL/Life
Technologies), purified (QIAaquick Nucleotide removal kit;
QIAGEN), hybridized to the membranes in ULTRAhyb buffer,
and washed according to the manufacturer (ULTRAhyb; Am-
bion). After washing, blots were analyzed by PhosphorImager
quantitation (Fuji Imaging Plate, Fuji Imaging Analyzer BAS-
2500, Image Reader V1.4E, and Image Gauge V.3.01 software;
Fuji Photo Film Europe).
Competitive Repopulation Assay for Murine BM Stem Cells.
C57BL/6 recipient mice (CD45.2) were lethally irradiated by a
single exposure to 9.5 Gy of gamma irradiation from a 137Cs
source (Instrument AB Scanditronix). Irradiated recipients were
transplanted intravenously (0.5 ml/mouse) by tail-vein injection
with 1,000 freshly isolated LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells (from B6.SJL
mice, CD45.1) or the expansion equivalent (EE) of 1,000
LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells cultured in the absence or presence of
TNF-␣ and Jo2 (or an isotype-matched control antibody). In
vitro cultures were performed in two to six parallels for each
group of treatment. At the day of transplantation, parallels were
individually counted, and subsequently pooled, washed, and
transplanted. Donor cells were cotransplanted with 200,000 un-
fractionated CD45.2 (recipient type) BM cells to ensure survival,
but also to promote a standard competitor source of HSCs,
thereby allowing a better quantification of HSC activity (36). To
address the effect of TNF-␣ and Jo2 on single HSC, a limiting
number of HSCs were transplanted, in that only six LinϪ
Sca1ϩkitϩCD34ϪCD45.2ϩ cells were directly sorted (by a single
cell depositor) into 0.1 ml serum-free media supplemented with
SCF, IL-3 plus IL-6 with or without TNF-␣ and Jo2 in a U-bot-
tomed 96-well plate. After 9 d incubation, individual wells were
harvested and washed with a total of 0.5 ml PBS plus 1% FCS,
mixed with 240,000 unfractionated CD45.1ϩ competitor BM
cells, and subsequently, 0.5 ml was injected into each irradiated
CD45.1ϩ mouse (cell numbers injected corresponded to the ex-
pansion equivalent of five LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩCD34Ϫ cells and
200,000 unfractionated BM cells as competitor). All mice were
kept in individually ventilated cages throughout the experiment,
and given sterile food and autoclaved acidified water. Mice were
bled from the retroorbital sinus venous plexus and peripheral
blood (PB) analyzed 4–6 wk and 14–18 wk after transplantation
for donor reconstitution. PB samples were lysed with ammonium
chloride before being stained with antibodies against CD45.1,
CD45.2, and lineage-specific antigens (all from BD PharMingen)
and analyzed on a FACSCalibur™ (Becton Dickinson). Serial
transplantations were performed by pooling BM from primary
recipients 16–18 wk after transplantation and injecting 0.5 femur
equivalent into each new lethally irradiated secondary recipient.
Analysis of secondary recipients was performed 3 mo after sec-
ondary transplantation.
Statistical Analysis. All results were expressed as the mean
(SEM) of data obtained from three or more separate experiments,
and else as the mean (SD). The statistical significance of differ-
ences between group means were determined using the Student’s
t test when n Ն 3.
Results
LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ Candidate Stem Cells Have Little or No
Constitutive Expression of Fas and Lack Responsiveness to an
Agonistic Fas-activating Antibody. LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells,
although constituting only 0.05–0.1% of total BM cells,
have been demonstrated to contain most if not all LTRCs
and represent a virtually pure population of multipotent
progenitors. In agreement with previous studies (23),
LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells lacked detectable cell surface Fas ex-
pression (Fig. 1 A). In comparison, a small fraction of
LinϪSca1Ϫc-kitϩ progenitor cells expressed low levels of
Fas, whereas a larger fraction of more mature LinϪSca1Ϫ
c-kitϪ cells were Fasϩ.
In vitro clonogenic growth of LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells
cultured in the presence of KL plus IL-3 or a combination
of multiple early-acting cytokines (KL plus IL-3 plus IL-6
plus FL plus G-CSF), was not affected by stimulation with
a Fas-activating antibody (Jo2; Fig. 1 B). In contrast, mu-
rine thymocytes underwent apoptosis in response to Jo2
(37). Thus, LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ candidate murine BM stem
cells express little or no cell surface Fas, and remain unre-
sponsive to Fas activation after activation with growth-
promoting cytokines.
Effects of In Vitro Cycling and TNF-␣ on Fas Expression and
Fas Responsiveness of Candidate Murine Stem Cells. As
LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells cultured in the presence of growth-
promoting cytokines remained unresponsive to Fas activa-
tion (Fig. 1 B), we next investigated whether or not
LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells remained FasϪ after cytokine stimu-
lation. Such cytokine stimulation is associated with prolif-
eration as well as differentiation and as expected, Fas ex-
pression increased with differentiation as assessed by
acquisition of lineage-specific antigens (Fig. 2 A). In con-
trast, cells maintaining a LinϪ phenotype after cytokine
stimulation were heterogeneous with regard to Fas expres-
sion. Thus, Fas expression was also specifically investigated
on cells that maintained a LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ phenotype, as
virtually all short- and long-term repopulating stem cells
have been demonstrated to have this phenotype (28, 30,
38, 39). After 5 d of culture in c-kit ligand, IL-3, and IL-6
(K36), cells had expanded 54-fold, of which 12% remained
LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ (Fig. 2 A; means of three experiments).
Whereas Ͼ50% of LinϪSca1Ϫc-kitϩ progenitor cells ex-
944 Fas and TNF-␣ Targeting of Hematopoietic Stem Cells
pressed Fas at high levels, only a small fraction of
LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ candidate stem cells expressed Fas, and at
very low levels (Fig. 2). After 9 d of incubation, only a
small fraction of cells remained LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ, on which
Fas expression was not further upregulated when compared
with day 5 (unpublished data).
As TNF-␣ has been demonstrated to upregulate Fas ex-
pression and induce Fas responsiveness on more committed
progenitor cells (18, 37, 40), we next investigated whether
TNF-␣ could upregulate Fas expression on LinϪSca1ϩ
c-kitϩ cells. After 5 d of incubation in K36 plus TNF-␣, cell
numbers were 57% lower than in the absence of TNF-␣.
However, a lower fraction of cells became lineage positive
in the presence of TNF-␣ and 20% of the cells remained
LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ (Fig 2 B; means of three experiments).
Noteworthy, most if not all (Ͼ90%) TNF-␣ exposed
LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells expressed Fas at high levels (Fig. 2
B), whereas K36 plus TNF-␣–treated LinϪScaϩkitϩ cells
from lpr (Fas deficient) mice, remained negative for Fas
(unpublished data). Interestingly, the mean geometric in-
tensity of Fas expression was higher on LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ
than LinϪSca1Ϫc-kitϩ cells (P Ͻ 0.05). Thus, TNF-␣ in
combination with early-acting cytokines induces Fas ex-
pression at high levels on candidate murine stem cells.
Next, LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells were explored for their
TNF-␣ and TNF-␣ plus Fas-responsiveness when cultured
in KL plus IL-3 or a cocktail of early-acting cytokines (Fig.
3 A). In agreement with previous studies (11, 12), colony
formation by LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells in response to both cy-
tokine combinations was inhibited by TNF-␣. Further-
more, and in striking contrast to cells cultured in the ab-
sence of TNF-␣ (Fig. 1 B), KL plus IL-3 plus TNF-␣- and
cocktail TNF-␣-stimulated colony formation was inhibited
by Jo2 by as much as 69 and 59% (Fig. 3 A), respectively.
Neither Jo2 in the absence of TNF-␣, or an isotype-
matched control antibody in the presence of TNF-␣
showed any effect on colony formation (Fig. 3 A).
As freshly isolated LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells displayed little
or no Fas expression or responsiveness, we next performed
single cell experiments to establish whether stimulation

type mice (open histograms) or lpr mice (closed histograms), were stained
with antibodies against lineage markers (CD4, CD5, CD8, B220, Gr-1,
Mac-1, Ter-119), Sca1, c-kit, and Fas (Jo2), and analyzed by flow cytom-
etry. Lineage-negative cells were gated and investigated for Fas expression
in the Sca1ϩc-kitϩ (I), Sca1Ϫc-kitϩ (II), or Sca1Ϫc-kitϪ (III) fraction as
shown. (B) Number of colonies generated from LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells

of Jo2 (0.2 ␮g/ml). Colonies were scored after 10 to 12 d of incubation
and are presented as means (SD) of two out of totally five experiments.

the absence or presence of TNF-␣ for 5 d, at which time cells were
stained with anti-Fas, c-kit, Sca1, and lineage-specific antibodies (or iso-
type-matched control antibodies) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Pro-
files show results from one representative experiment. Percentages pre-

with TNF-␣ and Jo2 would be able to block the first cell
divisions of LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells (Fig. 3 B). Again, Jo2
alone showed no ability to reduce the number or size of
clones generated in the absence of TNF-␣ (unpublished
data). Interestingly, TNF-␣ did not significantly reduce the
number of proliferative clones, but rather reduced their size
(P Ͻ 0.01). Likewise, in the presence of TNF-␣, Jo2 re-
duced the size but not number of LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ clones
(P Ͻ 0,005; Fig. 3 B), suggesting that TNF-␣– and Fas-
responsive LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells can undergo a limited num-
ber of cell divisions before becoming sensitive to TNF-␣
and Fas-induced growth inhibition. In further support of
this, delaying addition of Jo2 for 20–92 h only slightly re-
duced Jo2-induced growth inhibition (Fig. 3 B). However,
when Jo2 was added after 164 h, almost no Jo2-induced
growth suppression was observed.
The delayed addition experiments suggested a lag time
between TNF-␣ stimulation and acquisition of Fas re-
sponsiveness, which potentially could reflect a require-
ment for upregulation of TNF receptors in response to
K36-induced cycling. In steady-state BM of adult mice,
almost all LTRCs reside in the CD34Ϫ fraction, and
LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩCD34Ϫ cells represent a virtually pure
population of HSCs (33, 41). RT-PCR analysis of 25
highly purified LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩCD34Ϫ cells demonstrated
mRNA expression of both TNF receptors (Fig. 4 A).
However, only a small fraction of freshly isolated
LinϪSca1ϩCD34- cells had detectable cell surface expres-
sion of TNF receptors (Fig. 4 B). In response to cytokine-
induced expansion, LTRCs become CD34ϩ (42), and af-
ter 20 h of K36 stimulation (at which time point virtually
no LTRCs have divided; unpublished data), TNF receptor
expression was dramatically upregulated on LinϪSca1ϩc-
kitϩCD34ϩ cells (86%; Fig. 4 B). Moreover, after 3 d of
K36 stimulation, virtually all LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩCD34ϩ cells
expressed TNF receptors. Thus, TNF receptor expression

sence or presence of TNF-␣, Jo2 (0.2 ␮g/ml) or an isotype-matched
hamster IgG antibody (Ctr. Ab; 0.2 ␮g/ml). After 10 to 12 d of incuba-
tion, colony numbers were evaluated. Results are presented as mean (SD)
and represent data from two to four experiments. Controls (no TNF-␣ or
Jo2) were set to represent 100%, and reflected 104 Ϯ 9 and 78 Ϯ 3 colo-
nies for KL ϩ IL-3– and cocktail-stimulated cultures, respectively. (B)
LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells were plated at 1 cell/well in 20 ␮l complete
IMDM as described in experimental procedures, at a total of 225 cells/
group. Jo2 (0.2 ␮g/ml) was added as indicated to cocktail (KL ϩ IL-3 ϩ
IL-6 ϩ FL ϩ G-CSF) ϩ TNF-␣–stimulated cultures at initiation of cul-
ture (time 0) or after 20-, 44-, 92-, and 164 h preincubation. Wells were
scored for clonal growth (total number of clones and clone size) after 10
to 12 d of incubation. Large colonies were defined as clones covering
more than 10% of the well. Results are presented as the mean (ϮSEM) of
three separate experiments. Hamster IgG control antibody had no effect
on cocktail ϩ TNF-␣–induced clonal formation.

ulation of TNF receptor expression. (A) 25 LinϪScaϩkitϩ34Ϫ cells were
subjected to global mRNA amplification. 2 ␮g of the resulting cDNA

bridized with radiolabeled probes for TNFR-p75 and TNFR-p55, or
␤-actin (as a house keeping control gene). Samples of 25 LinϪScaϩ
kitϩ34Ϫ cells amplified without addition of reverse transcriptase (no RT)
served as negative control. (B) Lineage depleted or LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ BM
cells were stained for CD34, Sca1, and TNF receptor expression as well as

is highly upregulated on candidate stem cells upon cyto-
kine-induced cycling.
TNF-␣ and Fas Receptor Activation Compromise the Recon-
stituting Ability of LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ Stem Cells. Although
highly enriched in LTRC activity, LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells
are heterogenous, and represent in part cells with only
short-term repopulating activity (43). Thus, only in vivo
reconstitution experiments could conclusively address
whether Fas- and TNF-␣–responsive progenitors included
true LTRCs. Furthermore, as LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells can
undergo a limited number of cell divisions in the presence
of TNF-␣ and Fas receptor activation, it remained unclear
whether this activation would positively or negatively af-
fect HSC function.
First, to investigate whether LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩFasϩ cells
generated in in vitro cultures included LTRCs, we con-
ducted in vivo reconstitution experiments in which
LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells were cultured for 5 d with K36 with
or without TNF-␣. Remaining LinϪ cells were subse-
quently sorted into Fasϩ and FasϪ subpopulations (Fig. 5,
A and B) and investigated for their ability to multilineage
reconstitute lethally irradiated recipients. From cultures
lacking TNF-␣, all long-term reconstituting activity was
derived from FasϪ cells. This was in striking contrast to
cells cultured in the presence of TNF-␣, in which the Fasϩ
fraction was responsible for all LTRC activity (Table I).
Thus, TNF-␣ efficiently induces high levels of Fas expres-
sion on LTRCs.
We have recently demonstrated that LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ
cells cultured under serum-free conditions in the presence
of K36, undergo self-renewing cell divisions and preserve
their ability to short- and long-term multilineage reconsti-
tute lethally irradiated mice (24, 25). Thus, LinϪSca1ϩ
c-kitϩ cells were cultured under such self-renewing condi-
tions in the absence or presence of TNF-␣ and/or Jo2. Af-
ter 3, 5, and 9 d of incubation in K36, TNF-␣ reduced the
cellular expansion by 14, 46, and 43%, respectively,
whereas the addition of Jo2 only slightly reduced cell
numbers further (33, 56, and 69% reduction after 3, 5, and
9 d respectively).
Lethally irradiated mice were transplanted with 1,000
freshly isolated LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ CD45.1ϩ cells or their ex-
pansion equivalents (EEs) after 3, 5, and 9 d of culture (in
competition with 200,000 CD45.2ϩ BM cells; Fig. 6). 3–9 d
exposure to TNF-␣ reduced the short-term (4–6 wk) re-
constituting activity of cultured LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells by
40% (Fig. 6), whereas LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells incubated for
3, 5, or 9 d in the absence of TNF-␣ showed no drop in
reconstituting activity in response to Jo2 (unpublished
data). The level of short-term engraftment of cells cultured
in the presence of TNF-␣ plus Jo2 was reduced by as much
as 87–95% after culture (Fig. 6). Similarly, TNF-␣ reduced
long-term (14–18 wk) reconstituting activity of cultured
LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells by 63–71%, and TNF-␣ plus Jo2 by
90–98% (Fig. 6).
The ability to self-renew in vivo is an important charac-
teristic of true LTRCs, best established through their abil-
ity to multilineage reconstitute lethally irradiated serially
transplanted recipients (44, 45). Thus, cells from primary
recipients were transplanted into secondary recipients (Ta-
ble II). Reductions in reconstituting activity were observed
for cells originally cultured in the presence of TNF-␣, and
exposure to TNF-␣ ϩ Jo2 virtually abrogated the ability to
reconstitute secondary recipients (Table II). The relative
contribution of TNF-␣ and/or Jo2-exposed LinϪSca1ϩ

purity (percentages in quadrants represent percent-

The expansion equivalent of 650 LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells were transplanted

200,000 unfractionated BM cells (CD45.2) into lethally irradiated C57bl/6
recipients (CD45.2). After 4 mo, PB analysis was performed to determine
percentage donor derived reconstitution (SD). All mice with Ͼ1%
CD45.1 reconstitution showed multilineage reconstitution. Similar results
were obtained in a second experiment in which recipients did not receive
competitor marrow cells, in that FasϪ and Fasϩ cells were responsible for
all LTRC activity in TNF-␣–unexposed and exposed cultures,
respectively (unpublished data).

c-kitϩ cells toward reconstitution of various blood cell lin-
eages (B, T, and myeloid) did not differ from that of uncul-
tured or K36-cultured cells (Table III). Thus, exposure of
LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ stem cells to TNF-␣ and Fas activation
severely compromise their ability to short- and long-term
reconstitute the hematopoietic system.
Finally, to address the direct effect of TNF-␣ and Jo2 on
individual HSC, limiting numbers of LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ
CD34Ϫ HSC were used to study the effect of TNF-␣ and
Jo2 in mice primarily repopulated by single LTRCs, also
allowing a more accurate assessment of loss of LTRC activ-
ity in response to TNF-␣ and Jo2. Out of a total of 19 re-
cipients transplanted with 5 LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩCD34Ϫ cells
stimulated for 9 d with K36, 12 (63%) were found to sus-
tain long-term multilineage donor derived reconstitution
(Table IV). In contrast, of mice transplanted with the same
number of cells exposed to K36 plus TNF-␣ plus Jo2, only
1 out of 17 (6%) showed multilineage reconstitution. These
data suggested that ‫%02ف‬ of K36-cultured LinϪSca1ϩ
c-kitϩCD34Ϫ cells sustained long-term reconstituting ac-
tivity, which was reduced to 1–2% if cultured in the pres-
ence of TNF-␣ plus Jo2. Thus, TNF-␣ and Fas activation
severely compromise the ability of LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩCD34Ϫ
HSC to short- and long-term multilineage reconstitute
the hematopoietic system. In agreement with this, LinϪ

948 Fas and TNF-␣ Targeting of Hematopoietic Stem Cells
Sca1ϩc-kitϩ cells cultured for 9 d in K36 and TNF-␣
showed a dramatic reduction in cells with a LinϪSca1ϩ
c-kitϩ HSC phenotype, which were virtually eliminated
upon activation with Jo2 (Fig. 7).
The negative effect of TNF-␣ on LTRC self-renewal
might potentially be mediated through its ability to induce
Fas expression on HSC, thus rendering HSCs responsive
to Fas activation during/after transplantation. However,
TNF-␣–exposed LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells purified from lpr
mice (defective in Fas receptor expression) were equally
reduced in their long-term repopulating ability as wild-
type cells, suggesting that TNF-␣–induced reduction in
LTRC activity occurs independently of the Fas pathway
(Fig. 8).
Discussion
Previous studies have demonstrated that cytokines such
as TNF-␣, macrophage inhibitory protein 1␣ (MIP-1␣),
and TGF-␤ can inhibit the in vitro growth of primitive he-
matopoietic progenitors (8, 46, 47). Such an effect of MIP-
1␣ is however associated with enhanced rather than re-
duced maintenance of candidate HSCs in culture (48, 49).
TGF-␤ has been shown to accelerate depletion of HSCs
under in vitro culture conditions which themselves result
in loss of HSC activity (50, 51), making it difficult to dis-
tinguish between effects on self-renewal and other mecha-
nisms. Recent developments have now made it possible to
study HSC self-renewal and its regulation in vitro (24–27).
Through such studies, a number of growth stimulatory cy-
tokines have been shown to promote HSC self-renewing
cell divisions. Using the same approach, we here demon-
strate that TNF-␣ and Fas can negatively regulate the self-
renewal of highly purified HSCs.
TNF receptors and Fas which are members of the same
receptor superfamily, have been demonstrated to be nonre-
dundant regulators of the immune system (52–54). Ample
evidence also implicate their involvement in the patho-
physiology of a number of blood formation disorders asso-
ciated with enhanced apoptosis, such as myelodysplastic
syndromes and aplastic anemia (15–17, 19, 21, 22, 55) as
well as in acute GVHD (9, 56).
Whereas TNF-␣ and Fas have been convincingly dem-
onstrated to mediate growth suppression of in vitro clono-
genic progenitor cells (8, 10–12, 18, 40), their receptor ex-
pression pattern and potential effects on LTRCs has been
unknown. Recently, CD27, another member of the TNF
family, was demonstrated to be expressed on HSCs (57),
but the biological function of CD27 on HSCs remains to
be investigated. The present studies unequivocally demon-
strate that self-renewing murine BM HSCs can be targeted
by TNF-␣ and Fas, and consequently become severely
compromised in their ability to short- and long-term mul-
tilineage reconstitute hematopoiesis.
Whereas TNF-␣ has been clearly implicated to be in-
volved in a number of BM failure syndromes, the potential
role of TNF-␣ in regulating steady-state hematopoiesis is
unclear. Although studies in p55 TNF receptor–deficient
demonstrated increased numbers of LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells
and colony forming unit spleen day 12 (11, 13), older (but
not younger) mice revealed reduced HSC numbers and
function, suggesting a complex role of TNF-␣ in regulat-
ing HSCs. The interpretation of this finding is further
complicated by the existence of two TNF receptors, and
the HSC compartment of mice deficient in both TNF re-
ceptors has yet to be investigated. In addition, the effects of
TNF-␣ on hematopoiesis are pleiotropic and context
dependent (8), and whereas low (physiological) levels of

The progeny of five LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩCD34ϪCD45.2ϩ cells directly
sorted into serum-free medium and K36 or K36 ϩ TNF-␣ ϩ Jo2, were
transplanted after 9 d of culture together with 200,000 CD45.1ϩ BM
cells into lethally irradiated CD45.1ϩ recipients. 14 wk after
transplantation, PB was analyzed by flow cytometry for the presence of
donor-derived (CD45.2ϩ) cells of the B (B220), T (CD3), and myeloid
(Gr1/Mac1) cell lineages.

to B, T, and myeloid cell reconstitution. None of the negative mice con-

TNF-␣ in many systems have been demonstrated to be
crucial, high levels can be detrimental.
The present findings suggests that TNF-␣ is likely to
have little or no suppressive effect on quiescent HSC dom-
inating during steady-state hematopoiesis, as supported by
low levels of TNF receptor expression and lack of TNF-␣
suppression of noncycling HSCs. In contrast, under in vitro
cycling conditions, TNF receptor expression was upregu-
lated and HSCs became sensitive to TNF-␣–induced sup-
pression. In support of this, TNF-␣ has been shown to
stimulate proliferation of mitotically quiescent hematopoi-
etic cell lines, but suppress their growth when rapidly cy-
cling (58). The negative effect of TNF-␣ on in vitro HSC
self-renewal was found to be independent of the Fas path-
way, as LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells from lpr mice, defective in
Fas receptor expression, were equally sensitive to TNF-␣–
induced suppression of HSCs. Although the lpr mice have
a somewhat leaky Fas deficiency, no Fas expression was ob-
served on LinϪScaϩkitϩ cells exposed to TNF-␣.
In a previous study, LinϪSca1ϩThy1.1ϩ HSCs were
found to lack expression of Fas (23). In agreement with
this, freshly isolated LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ BM cells in the
present studies also lacked detectable cell surface expression
of Fas. When induced to cycle by combinations of early-
acting cytokines, Fas expression was upregulated but only
marginally on cells which maintained a LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ
HSC phenotype, and in vitro clonogenic and in vivo short-
and long-term reconstituting LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells re-
mained unresponsive to activation by an agonistic anti-Fas
antibody. This unresponsiveness was not altered by using
an anti–hamster IgG antibody to further enhance cross-
linking (unpublished data). The difference in Fas respon-
siveness of HSCs and myeloid progenitors (10) could in
part be explained by HSCs expressing higher levels of
apoptosis-inhibiting genes such as Bcl-2 (59). In fact, when
Bcl-2 is overexpressed, committed myeloid progenitors
show enhanced Fas resistance (10). Noteworthy, LinϪ
Sca1ϩc-kitϩ cells became highly Fas-responsive only
when costimulated with cytokines promoting cycling and
TNF-␣, whereas TNF-␣ alone had little or no ability to
induce Fas responsiveness (unpublished data). In support of
a key role of TNF-␣ activation, HSC activity was retained
entirely in the Fas negative fraction after in vitro expansion
in the absence of TNF-␣, whereas in the presence of
TNF-␣, LTRCs were found exclusively in the Fas-positive
fraction. Thus, it appears that the ability of TNF-␣ to in-
duce Fas responsiveness of HSCs is at least in part a conse-
quence of upregulation of Fas expression on cycling HSCs,
which constitutively express no Fas. The ability of TNF-␣
to upregulate Fas expression has been demonstrated in a
number of other systems, and to be critically dependent on
nuclear factor (NF)-␬B activation (60–62). It is possible
that TNF-␣ might also provide an important co activation
signal for Fas activation in HSCs, as implicated for other
cell types (63–65).
It is noteworthy that the reduction in HSC numbers
(more than 10-fold) in response to TNF-␣ and Fas activa-
tion was much more dramatic than reductions in total cell
numbers (threefold). A preferential targeting of HSCs was
further supported by the preferential upregulation of Fas
and TNF receptors on LinϪSca1ϩc-kitϩ cells, and the vir-
tual elimination of such cells following prolonged TNF-␣
and Fas activation.
Whereas HSCs can expand in vivo, extensive efforts at
promoting stem cell expansion in vitro have proven less
successful (1, 66). One reason for this could be the tendency
of in vitro cultured stem cells to undergo apoptosis (1).
Based on our findings it is obvious that HSCs will upregu-
late TNF receptor expression after in vitro stem cell expan-
sion with potent growth-promoting cytokines. If such ex-
panded stem cells are subsequently exposed to TNF-␣ and/
or Fas ligand in vitro, or more likely in the BM microenvi-
ronment of ablated recipients, the consequence might be an
engraftment defect, as frequently observed after transplanta-
tion of ex vivo expanded stem cells (67).
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that although
HSCs constitutively express little or no Fas, enforced cy-
cling of HSCs combined with TNF-␣ activation upregu-
late Fas expression on HSCs, making them susceptible to
Fas-induced suppression. This combined with ample evi-
dence of the involvement of excessive TNF-␣ and Fas ac-
tivity in various BM failure syndromes and GVHD (9, 56),
suggest that self-renewing HSCs are likely targets for
TNF-␣– and Fas-induced BM suppression.
