Brief Definitive Report
Loss of function studies have implicated cell-
intrinsic factors such as p21 (Cheng et al.,
2000), GFI1 (Hock et al., 2004), and LNK
(Buza-Vidas et al., 2006) as physiological nega-
tive regulators of hematopoietic stem cell
(HSC) maintenance. Several extrinsic factors,
including TGF- (Larsson and Karlsson, 2005),
IFN- (Yang et al., 2005), and IL-3 (Yonemura
et al., 1996), as well TNF (Bryder et al., 2001;
Dybedal et al., 2001), have been demonstrated
to negatively affect HSC growth and mainte-
nance in vitro. However, the in vivo relevance
of these cytokines, as nonredundant cell-extrinsic
endogenous negative regulators of the HSC
compartment, has not been strongly supported
through in vivo lack of function studies (Seita
and Weissman, 2010).
TNF, a pleiotropic cytokine exerting both
inhibitory and stimulatory effects on a diversity
of cellular processes, is a key regulator of
immunological responses, and aberrant pr­o­
duction of TNF underlies the pathogenesis of
many human diseases, in particular acute and
chronic inflammatory diseases (Bradley, 2008),
for which TNF-blocking agents have become
an established treatment (Wiedmann et al.,
2009). Also, several BM failure syndromes such
as Fanconi anemia (Dufour et al., 2003; Milsom
et al., 2009) are associated with TNF over­
expression (Bagby and Meyers,2007).TNF signals
through two distinct TNF receptors, Tnfrsf1a
(TNF receptor super family 1a; or TNFR-p55)
and Tnfrsf1b (or TNFR-p75; Aggarwal, 2003),
that have been ascribed largely diverging roles.
Apart from TNF and lymphotoxin (or TNF-),
no other ligands have been shown to activate
the TNF receptors (Aggarwal, 2003). Tnfrsf1a
has an intracellular death domain implicated in
apoptosis signaling, whereas Tnfrsf1b has often
been implicated in the promotion of cellu­­
lar proliferation (Aggarwal, 2003). However,
mechanisms of cross talking, including ligand
passing between Tnfrsf1a and Tnfrsf1b receptors

Whereas maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is a requisite for life, uncon-
trolled expansion of HSCs might enhance the propensity for leukemic transformation.
Accordingly, HSC numbers are tightly regulated. The identification of physical cellular HSC
niches has underscored the importance of extrinsic regulators of HSC homeostasis. How-
ever, whereas extrinsic positive regulators of HSCs have been identified, opposing extrinsic
repressors of HSC expansion in vivo have yet to be described. Like many other acute and
chronic inflammatory diseases, bone marrow (BM) failure syndromes are associated with
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF) overexpression. However, the in vivo relevance of TNF in the
regulation of HSCs has remained unclear. Of considerable relevance for normal hemato­
poiesis and in particular BM failure syndromes, we herein demonstrate that TNF is a cell-
extrinsic and potent endogenous suppressor of normal HSC activity in vivo in mice. These
effects of TNF involve two distinct TNF receptors.

(enriched for multipotent stem and progenitor cells; Fig. 2 f)
mimicked the increased multilineage peripheral blood (PB)
reconstitution levels (Fig. 2, b and d), supporting the idea that
the suppressive effect of TNF is targeted to multipotent
HSCs. Although we did not specifically address the homing of
HSCs, altered HSC homing as a consequence of TNF recep-
tor deficiency is unlikely to explain the increased long-term
reconstitution, as short-term (3 wk) reconstitution levels were
unaffected in recipients of Tnfrsf1-dKO BM cells (Fig.2 b).
TNF-mediated suppression of HSC activity is dependent
on expression of both TNF receptors
As previous studies of the specific hematopoietic actions of
TNF mediated through Tnfrsf1a and Tnfrsf1b have been
conflicting (Zhang et al., 1995; Rebel et al., 1999), we next
evaluated the consequence of loss of either of the two TNF
receptors by studying mice deficient for either Tnfrsf1a
(Tnfrsf1a/) or Tnfrsf1b (Tnfrsf1b/) receptors. Notably, we
observed a competitive multilineage PB and BM LSK recon-
stitution advantage of BM cells from Tnfrsf1a/ (Fig. 2,
g and i) as well as Tnfrsf1b/ (Fig. 2, h and j) mice. This ad-
vantage was sustained after secondary transplantations (Fig. 2,
g–j), although the competitive advantage was more pro-
nounced with BM cells from Tnfrsf1-dKO mice (Fig. 2, a–f),
implicating the importance of both TNF receptors in restrict-
ing HSC expansion.
We next undertook a series of in vitro experiments to try
to corroborate the requirement of both TNF receptors for
the observed TNF-induced restriction of HSC activity. As
expected, the clonal growth of WT BM cells was strongly
inhibited in response to TNF (Fig. 3, a–c). Notably, TNF
had no discernable effect on the clonal growth of different
myeloerythroid progenitors from Tnfrsf1a/ or Tnfrsf1b/
mice (Fig. 3, a–c), and the same observation was made with
regard to the effect of TNF on the growth of HSC-enriched
LSK cells (Fig. 3 d), which is compatible with both Tnfrsf1a
and Tnfrsf1b being required for the suppressive effects
of TNF on HSCs and hematopoiesis. Importantly, TNF-
­mediated growth inhibition could not be rescued in cells over­
expressing the antiapoptotic protein BCL2 (Fig.S1,a–c;Domen
et al., 1998), suggesting that induction of apoptosis plays little
or no role in TNF-induced growth inhibition and HSC
expansion. However, as these experiments were performed
in vitro and as there are alternative, BCL2-resistant pathways
for apoptosis, we cannot rule out the possibility that the sup-
pressive effects of TNF on HSCs might involve apoptosis.
In vivo administration of TNF targets HSCs
Although no other ligands than TNF and TNF- are known
for the two TNF receptors, we could not rule out the possi-
bility that the HSC phenotype in Tnfrsf1a/ and Tnfrsf1b/
mice is not mediated by TNF. Thus, we next investigated
the effects of TNF administered in vivo on HSCs. Further-
more, as the suppressive impact of TNF on HSC activity
after transplantation but not in steady-state hematopoiesis could
in part be related to HSCs being recruited from quiescence
(Tartaglia et al., 1993), implicate that some functions of TNF
might be facilitated by or even strictly depend on the expres-
sion of both receptors, although evidence for this is limited.
The physiological relevance of the ability of TNF to sup-
press mouse and human HSC maintenance in vitro (Zhang
et al., 1995; Bryder et al., 2001; Dybedal et al., 2001) can
rightfully be questioned, among other reasons because the
investigated concentrations of TNF might be physiologically
irrelevant, because TNF exists in two isoforms (TNF and
TNF-; Aggarwal, 2003), and because the in vitro experi-
ments could not mimic the physiological balance and poten-
tially distinct roles of soluble and membrane-bound TNF
in vivo (Grell et al., 1995). Furthermore, TNF is likely to have
pleiotropic direct and indirect effects on HSCs in vivo. In
fact, previous in vivo TNF loss of function experiments did
not only fail to support a suppressive role of TNF in HSC
regulation, they rather implicated a stimulatory role of TNF
in HSC maintenance in vivo (Rebel et al., 1999), in apparent
discrepancy with studies demonstrating a potent suppressive
effect of TNF on normal HSCs in vitro (Bryder et al., 2001;
Dybedal et al., 2001), as well as HSCs in Fanconi anemia
models for BM failure syndromes being hyperresponsive to
TNF suppression in vitro (Milsom et al., 2009). Herein, we
sought to reconcile these previous findings and to establish
the in vivo role of TNF in the regulation of HSC mainte-
nance and expansion in mice lacking expression of either or
both TNF receptors.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
TNF restricts HSC activity in vivo
We first investigated HSC numbers and function in mice
deficient for both Tnfrsf1a (Tnfrsf1a/) and Tnfrsf1b
(Tnfrsf1b/) receptors, hereafter referred to as Tnfrsf1 double
KO (Tnfrsf1-dKO; Peschon et al., 1998). Unlike previous
studies of Tnfrsf1a/ mice (Zhang et al., 1995; Rebel et al.,
1999), we did not observe any differences in phenotypically
enriched HSCs (LSKFLT3; Fig. 1, b and c; Adolfsson et al.,
2001) nor in frequencies of long-term reconstituted mice
when unfractionated BM cells were transplanted at limiting
numbers from steady-state BM of WT and Tnfrsf1-dKO
(Fig. 1 d), suggesting that HSCs are not affected by TNF in
steady-state. Steady-state cell cycle analyses of cells within the
LSKFLT3 HSC-enriched compartment revealed only a
minor increase of cells in active cell cycle (G1 and S/G2/M) in
Tnfrsf1-dKO mice as compared with WT mice, and in both
cases LSKFLT3 cells were predominantly found to be highly
quiescent (Fig. 1, e and f).
In contrast to the steady-state analysis, Tnfrsf1-dKO BM
cells revealed a considerable competitive advantage over WT
BM cells in their ability to long-term reconstitute myeloid
and lymphoid cell lineages in myeloablated WT recipients
(Fig. 2, a–f). This competitive advantage of Tnfrsf1-dKO BM
cells was further enhanced after three rounds of serial trans-
plantation and maintained for a total of at least five rounds of
transplantation (Fig. 2 b). An enhanced Tnfrsf1-dKO donor
contribution to the phenotypically defined LSK compartment

Brief Definitive Report
induced a reduction in total BM cellularity (Fig. 4 b) and a
reduction in HSC activity as determined in a competitive
transplantation assay (Fig. 4, c–f). This suppressive effect of
TNF on HSC activity was enhanced in 5-FU–treated mice
(Fig. 4, b–f). These findings suggest that actively cycling
rather than quiescent HSCs are the primary targets of TNF
suppression, which is of relevance for the enhanced reconsti-
tution after transplantation.
This study provides the first in vivo evidence of a non­
redundant, cell-extrinsic factor involved in negative regulation
of the HSC compartment, specifically in a setting relevant for
BM transplantation. Importantly, our experiments of mice
into active proliferation upon transplantation (Allsopp et al.,
2001), we also sought to address the effect of TNF on cycling
versus quiescent HSCs. Of relevance, we previously reported
that HSCs up-regulate cell surface expression of TNF recep-
tors and become TNF responsive upon ex vivo proliferation
(Bryder et al., 2001). To address whether cell cycle activation
also enhances TNF-induced suppression of HSCs in vivo, we
took advantage of the cytotoxic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU),
which effectively eliminates cycling hematopoietic progeni-
tors but not HSCs, resulting in rapid recruitment of dormant
HSCs into active proliferation (Harrison and Lerner, 1991).

vidually isolated, and subsequently cells from each of the WT replicates were mixed with cells from one of the Tnfrsf1-dKO mice. Cells from each genotype
were mixed at equal numbers, and each cell mixture was analyzed individually. Cell mixtures were analyzed by FACS for G0 (DAPIlow/Ki67), G1 (DAPIlow/Ki67+),
and S/G2/M (DAPIhigh/Ki67+) cell cycle stages within the LSKFLT3 HSC compartment. Percentages represent mean (SD) values of all mice.

HSCs, either through signaling through both receptors or
potentially through the suggested role of the Tnfrsf1b in ligand
passing to the Tnfrsf1a receptor (Aggarwal, 2003).
The current findings are of considerable relevance for
several BM failure syndromes, in which enhanced expression
of TNF has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of hematopoietic failure
deficient in Tnfrsf1a or Tnfrsf1b expression, corroborated by
in vitro TNF response experiments, indicate that the ability
of TNF to suppress HSCs is dependent on expression of both
TNF receptors. This clearly implicates the importance of
both receptors in eliciting the signaling required to suppress

followed by subsequent backcrossing for five generations to C57BL/6 mice.
Tnfrsf1-dKO mice were used for phenotyping and competitive transplan-
tation experiments, with WT C57BL/6 mice (CD45.2+, CD45.1+, or F1
CD45.1+/CD45.2+) as controls. Tnfrsf1a/ and Tnfrsf1b/ single KO mice
were generated by crossing Tnfrsf1-dKO to WT C57BL/6 mice to create
single KO mice with identical allelic mutations as the original Tnfrsf1a/
and Tnfrsf1b/ mice, respectively. Heterozygous offspring were interbred
to generate Tnfrsf1a/ and Tnfrsf1b/ mice for in vitro experimentation
(Fig. 3, a–d), and WT littermates were used as controls. Single KO mice
were also backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice for an additional four genera-
tions to generate 10th generation Tnfrsf1a/ and Tnfrsf1b/ single KO mice.
These mice were used in the transplantation experiments. H2K–BCL-2 mice
have been described previously (Domen et al., 1998). Mice were main-
tained at the Lund University animal facility. All mice procedures were
performed with consent from the local ethics committee (Malmö/Lunds
djurförsöksetiska nämnd).
Phenotypic analysis and purification of HSCs. BM cells were collected
from femurs, tibiae, and sometimes iliac crests. For both phenotypic analysis
and FACS purification, unfractionated BM cells were stained with either
purified or fluorochrome-conjugated lineage antibodies against B220 (RA3-
6B2), GR-1 (RB6-8C5), MAC1 (M1/70), CD8 (53–6.7), TER119, CD4
(H129.19), and sometimes CD5 (53–7), all from BD. FACS purifications
were performed as previously described (Adolfsson et al., 2001). In brief,
cells were next either lineage depleted using sheep anti–rat IgG(Fc)–conjugated
immunomagnetic beads (Invitrogen) or cKIT enriched by using cKit-
­conjugated magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec). Purified lineage antibodies were
visualized with CyChrome (Invitrogen)- or Qdot 605 (Invitrogen)–conjugated
goat anti–rat antibodies; in the case of lineage depletion, cells were stained
after the lineage enrichment, and in the case of cKIT enrichment, cells were
stained before magnetic selection. Subsequently, cells were stained with
different combinations of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against SCA1
(D7 [BioLegend] or E13-161.7 [BD]), cKIT (or CD117, 2B8; eBioscience
or BD), FLT3 (or Flk2/CD135, 2F10.1; BD or eBioscience), and CD150
(or Slamf1, TC15-12F12.2; BioLegend). Propidium iodide (Invitrogen) or
7-amino-actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to exclude dead cells.
Gating was performed to exclude doublets from analysis.
For calculation of total numbers of LSK and LSKFLT3 cells, the fre-
quency of LSKFLT3 cells in each individual mouse, as determined by flow
cytometric evaluation of unfractionated BM cells, was multiplied by total
BM cell numbers. Total BM numbers were calculated based on total BM
cells in two femurs and two tibiae, representing 25% of total BM cells pres-
ent in a mouse. For cell cycle analyses (Thorén et al., 2008), 30 × 106
CD45.1+ (WT) and 30 × 106 CD45.2+ (Tnfrsf1-dKO) BM cells were mixed
and stained with antibodies against lineage markers, SCA1, cKIT, CD150,
and FLT3 as described in the previous paragraph, as well as with antibodies
against CD45.1+ (A20; BioLegend) and CD45.2+ (104; BioLegend).
Subsequently, cells were fixated in 2% paraformaldehyde (GTF) and per-
meabilized in 0.1% saponin from quillaja bark (Sigma-Aldrich) and
stained with anti-Ki67 (B56; BD) or isotype-conjugated antibodies. Before
analysis, cells were incubated in 2.5 µg/ml DAPI (Invitrogen) to visualize
DNA content.
Cells were analyzed or sorted on FACS Aria or DIVA cell sorters (BD).
All flow cytometry and FACS data were analyzed with FlowJo software
(Tree Star).
In vivo transplantation experiments. Competitive transplantation ex-
periments using the congenic CD45.1+/CD45.2+ mouse model were per-
formed as described previously (Szilvassy et al., 1990; Adolfsson et al., 2001).
In brief, CD45.2+ BM cells from TNF receptor–deficient mice were in-
jected intravenously along with competitor CD45.1 BM cells into lethally
irradiated (950 cGy) CD45.1+/2+ mice. PB was collected at the indicated
time points after transplantation and analyzed for donor reconstitution by
FACS. PB was obtained from retroorbital bleeding, red blood cells were
sedimented with 2% dextran T-500 (Pharmacia), remaining red blood cells
(Bagby and Meyers, 2007;Aalto et al., 2011). For instance, in
the case of Fanconi anemia,TNF has not only been demon-
strated to be overexpressed in the BM (Dufour et al., 2003),
but HSCs have also been found to be hyperresponsive to
TNF suppression in vitro (Milsom et al., 2009).The physio-
logical relevance of these in vitro findings, as well as previous
findings demonstrating that TNF has potent suppressive ef-
fects on WT mouse and human HSCs in vitro (Bryder et al.,
2001; Dybedal et al., 2001), are supported by our demonstra-
tion of a suppressive role of Tnfrsf1a and Tnfrsf1b on HSCs
in vivo, as well as an HSC-suppressive effect of TNF adminis-
tration in vivo.The reason for the opposite conclusions reached
in the experiments by Rebel et al. (1999) remains unclear. In
that study,Tnfrsf1a was rather suggested to play a critical posi-
tive role in maintaining HSCs.This role of TNF appeared to
be restricted to older mice (>6 mo old),although phenotypic
analysis of the HSC compartment in older mice showed no
significant difference from WT mice (Rebel et al., 1999).
Thus, it was only in long-term transplantation experiments
that reduced multilineage reconstitution was observed from
Tnfrsf1a/ BM cells as an indication of reduced HSC activ-
ity (Rebel et al., 1999), although phenotypic analysis of the
HSC compartment itself was not performed in transplanted
mice. It is not obvious how the age of the TNF receptor–
deficient HSCs could explain the different conclusions reached
between this previous study and our study, as we in our study
performed serial transplantation experiments for up to 76 wk
with HSCs with an intrinsicTNF receptor deficiency. More-
over, in our study, the enhanced long-term multilineage re-
constitution levels of TNF receptor–deficient BM cells were
corroborated by correspondingly enhanced chimerism also in
the phenotypic HSC compartment.Although the mice used
herein carry the same mutated alleles,the genetic background
of the TNF receptor–deficient strains and the nature of the
WT control mice were not described in detail in the study of
Rebel et al. (1999), and therefore the apparent discrepancy
could potentially be explained by this.In that regard,our study
included experiments in which experimental mice had been
backcrossed to a C57BL/6 genetic background and in which
WT littermates were used as controls.
This study establishes the in vivo relevance of the sup-
pressive effects of TNF on HSCs in hematopoiesis and BM
failure syndromes and supports the further exploration of
anti-TNF treatment in such conditions (Dufour et al., 2009;
Scott et al., 2010; Aalto et al., 2011). The in vivo condition-
ing models used in this study, 5-FU treatment and irradia-
tion, have been shown to cause increases in blood levels of
TNF (Xun et al., 1994; Okamoto et al., 2000), suggesting
that anti-TNF treatment might also be beneficial to enhance
posttransplantation reconstitution (Ferrara et al., 2009).

were lysed with ammonium chloride, and leukocytes were subsequently
stained with antibodies against CD3, B220, and MAC1 or against CD4,
CD8, B220, MAC1, and NK1.1 (PK136; BioLegend).
In limiting dilution experiments, positively multilineage reconstituted
mice were defined as having a minimum of 0.1% total donor PB cells and
0.02% donor cells of each of the myeloid (MAC1+), B (B220+), and
T (CD4/CD8+) cell lineages. Competitive repopulating unit (CRU) frequen­
cies were calculated using Poisson9 software (Benveniste et al., 2003). For
serial transplantations, BM cells from reconstituted recipients were isolated,
and cells representing 0.5 femur equivalent were serially transplanted into
secondary irradiated recipients.
In in vivo TNF treatment experiments, WT (CD45.2+) were injected
intravenously with 5-FU and/or recombinant mouse TNF (Genentech).
After treatment, BM cells were isolated from two femurs and two tibiae and
counted, and 1/50 of isolated BM cells (i.e., 1/200 of total mouse BM cells)
were transplanted in competition with 106 fresh CD45.1+ BM into each
lethally irradiated CD45.1+ recipient. The total number of CRUs present in a
mouse after treatment was calculated as previously described (Szilvassy et al.,
1990). Based on the assumption that one CRU resides within 104 whole BM
cells (Szilvassy et al., 1990), the competing graft (106 whole BM) contained 100
CRUs. The number of CRUs per transplant from treated mice (X) = 100 ×
(% myeloid chimerism 16 wk after transplant)/(100%  % myeloid chimerism
16 wk after transplant). The number of BM cells containing 1 CRU (Y) = (total
BM cellularity/200) × X. Total CRUs/mouse = total BM cellularity/Y.
In vitro culture assays. Freshly isolated unfractionated BM cells and sorted
HSC-enriched cells were cultured using liquid and semisolid culture condi-
tions (at 37°C, 98% humidity, and 5% CO2) to evaluate their colony-forming
and clonogenic capacities. CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-Meg formations
from whole BM were evaluated in semisolid methylcellulose medium as
previously described (Adolfsson et al., 2001), and cells were cultured in the
presence or absence of 20 ng/ml TNF in addition to the indicated cytokines.
For evaluation of proliferative capacities, HSC-enriched cells were sorted
into serum-free medium (X-vivo15; BioWhittaker), supplemented with 1%
detoxified bovine serum albumin (STEMCELL Technologies), 0.1 mM
-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM l-glutamine (Invitrogen), streptomycin/penicillin
(Sigma-Aldrich), and cytokines rrSCF (25 ng/ml; Amgen or PeproTech),
rhIL-6 (50 ng/ml; provided by Genetics Institute Cambridge, San Francisco,
CA), and rmIL3 (20 ng/ml; PeproTech), with or without 20 ng/ml TNF.
After 7 d of culture, total cell numbers were counted, and expansion equiva-
lents were calculated. For evaluation of clonogenic capacity, HSC-enriched
cells were single cell sorted in Terasaki plates into IMDM, supplemented
with 10% prescreened FCS (Invitrogen), -mercaptoethanol, l-glutamine,
and streptomycin/penicillin as above, with the addition of 25 ng/ml rrSCF
and 25 ng/ml rhG-SCF (Amgen), with or without 20 ng/ml TNF. After 11 d
in culture, wells were evaluated for colony numbers and size.
Statistics. Statistical analyses were performed using Excel software (Micro-
soft). Student’s t test was used to generate all p-values.
Online supplemental material. Fig. S1 shows clonogenic capacities of
HSCs sorted from WT or Bcl2 transgenic mice cultured in the presence and
absence of TNF. Online supplemental material is available at http://www
