Abstract: Effective treatment with etanercept results from a congregation of immunological
signaling and modulating roles played by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a pervasive
member of the TNF super-family of cytokines participating in numerous immunologic and
metabolic functions. Macrophages, lymphocytes and other cells produce TNF as part of the
deregulated immune response resulting in psoriasis or other chronic inﬂammatory disorders.
Tumor necrosis factor is also produced by macrophages and lymphocytes responding to foreign
antigens as a primary response to potential infection. Interference with cytokine signaling by
etanercept yields therapeutic response. At the same time, interference with cytokine signaling by
etanercept exposes patients to potential adverse events. While the efﬁcacy of etanercept for the
treatment of psoriasis is evident, the risks of treatment continue to be deﬁned. Of the potential
serious adverse events, response to infection is the best characterized in terms of physiology,
incidence, and management. Rare but serious events: activation of latent tuberculosis, multiple
sclerosis, lymphoma, and others, have been observed but have questionable or yet to be deﬁned
association with therapeutic uses of etanercept. The safe use of etanercept for the treatment of
psoriasis requires an appreciation of potential adverse events as well as screening and monitoring
strategies designed to manage patient risk

Characterizing the safety of a drug is rarely simple and never complete. Both short
and long-term drug safety proﬁles require episodic, critical reviews of available
information. Episodic reviews are necessary to survey case reports and put previous
summaries into perspective. Critical evaluation is important to determine relevance,
veracity, and adequacy of available information. Etanercept is no exception.
The short-term safety of etanercept is well established by rigorous clinical trials in
rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and psoriasis (Leonardi et al 2003; Papp 2004;
Keystone 2005; Kavanaugh et al 2006). Registries, now abundant in the rheumatology
arena, are resources for assessing long-term risk and harm (Sokka 2004). Psoriasis
registries should provide useful data over the next few years. Nonetheless, information
extracted from registries must be put into context. The underlying disease may have
epidemiologic characteristics different from the target disease. And, by their nature,
registries are not as restrictive or as selective as controlled trials (Krishnan and Fries
2004). There is a treatment bias: treatment tends to be given to a sicker population.
There may be a confounding indication: not every enrollee fulﬁlls appropriate
diagnostic criteria. Biased patient selection, good or bad, may exaggerate effectiveness
or safety. In addition, patients enrolled in clinical registries have few if any restriction on
concurrent therapy thus confounding drug-drug interactions and attribution of efﬁcacy
or adverse effects. On the other hand, registries are thought to be more reﬂective of

real world experience. In addition, registries often provide
larger number of patients, long periods of observation and
data collection compared with registration trials.
Case reports will identify unanticipated adverse events
attributed to etanercept but are limited by the potential for
inappropriate association of cause and effect. Etanercept is an
effective therapy for psoriasis: effectiveness is advantageous
to its adoption as a new therapy. This advantage is potentially
offset by heightened scrutiny, off-label use, and sub-standard
post marketing reports of adverse events.
In this review, every effort is made to provide a balanced
appraisal of risk. Pathophysiology and likelihood of
association are considered as complements to incident reports
when evaluating safety (Mulrow et al 1997; Ioannidis et al
2006). Where assessment of risk is hampered by insufﬁcient
epidemiologic data, provisional estimates or cautionary
comments are inserted.
Background
TNF-alpha, often referred to as tumor necrosis factor (TNF),
is one member of the TNF superfamily of cytokines (Zhou
et al 2002). TNF was initially described as a hemorrhagic
necrosis factor produced by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated
tumours. We now appreciated that TNF is a ubiquitous
cytokine expressed by many cell types and having activity
in innate and adaptive immune pathways (Zhou et al 2002).
As a consequence of its important immunological function,
TNF plays a central role in acute and chronic inﬂammation
(Liz-Grana and Carnota 2001; Pfeffer, 2003). The variety
of immunological and metabolic processes affected by
TNF-alpha, the functions of soluble and membrane bound
TNF-alpha, and interactions between members of the TNF
superfamily are impacted by the molecular activity of TNF-
inhibitors such as etanercept. Both unanticipated risks and
unanticipated beneﬁts may arise through long-term high
frequency exposure to a TNF-inhibitor. Given the unique
molecular characteristics of each TNF-inhibitor, we expect
common risk-beneﬁt proﬁles and differences.
Etanercept is a dimeric fusion protein produced using
recombinant genetic programming of Chinese hamster ovary
cells. The protein has a molecular weight of 150 kDa and
consists of two 75 kDa TNF-alpha receptors linked to the Fc
portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (Dembic et al 1990;
Mohler et al 1993).
Clinical study reports are sufﬁciently detailed to provide
short term safety data, but none are powered to identify rare
events. The National Data Bank for Rheumatic Diseases
and the publicly available BIOBADASER are examples of
registries that provide excellent longitudinal information
on patients with rheumatologic diseases treated with TNF-
antagonists.
The structure of this review is as follows: Broad
categories of adverse events are identiﬁed. Within each
category there may be speciﬁc, noteworthy concerns. Inciting
observations and scientiﬁc rationale preface each general and
speciﬁc category. Data relevant to the category are presented
accompanied by brief commentary. Comparative data for
TNF-antagonists as a group are avoided where possible to
limit the scope of the review.
Mechanisms of action
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha engages in many aspect of
immunological function. By its activity on TNF-alpha,
etanercept will impact immunological and inﬂammatory
processes ranging from innate and extrinsic immunological
response, cellular trafﬁcking, acute and chronic inﬂammation,
fever, and neuroendocrine regulation (Gruss and Dower
1995). TNF interacts with glucocorticoids to regulate Toll-
like receptor 2 gene expression (Hermoso et al 2004).
The precise mechanisms of action of TNF-antagonists
are not known. Certainly etanercept binds to free, soluble,
or non-membrane-bound TNF-alpha but etanercept also
has activity against the p55 receptor TNF-beta, also called
lymphotoxin (Williams and Grifﬁths 2002; Keystone and
Dinarello 2005). Contrary to the effects on TNF-alpha, the
activity of etanercept against p55 may stimulate immuno-
reactivity (Han et al 2005) in addition to having effects on B-,
T-, NK-cells and lymphoid architecture (Spahn et al 2005).
Moreover,thereisevidencethatbothetanerceptandinﬂiximab

the effects of etanercept are mediated by its binding of soluble

The implications of accessory TNF-antagonist activities are
not known. Etanercept has peak absorption at 51 hours and a
mean half-life of 68 hours (Korth-Bradley et al 2000).
Whether or not TNF is an intrinsic pyrogen remains
controversial (Stefferl et al 1996; Luheshi et al 1997;
Dinarello 2005). In the mouse model, TNF does not appear
to have pyrogen activity (Dinarello 2005). Nonetheless,
resolving the question for humans is signiﬁcant as fever is a
common, early, ubiquitous sign of infection and infections
remain the most prominent safety concern during treatment
with TNF-antagonists.

and Rivier 1999). The neuroendocrine effects of TNF may be

chronic inﬂammatory disease (Tyring et al 2006).
Adverse events
Injection site reactions
Mechanical processes such as poor injection technique,
irritation, or immunologically mediated inflammatory
processes associated with either drug or excipients cause
injection site reactions. Foreign proteins may cause direct
or indirect inﬂammatory response (Shepherd 2003). It is not
surprising that injection site reactions are by far the most
common side effect associated with etanercept.
Studies evaluating etanercept for the treatment of RA
report a high incidence of injection site reactions with
34%–37% of etanercept-treated patients compared with
7%–10% of controls reporting reactions (Lebwohl 2002;
Fleischmann and Yocum 2004). The high incidence in the
RA population contrasts with a much lower incidence seen
in psoriasis studies: 14%–20% (Leonardi et al 2003; Papp
2004; Papp et al 2005). Why there are stark differences in
the incidence of injection site reactions between RA and
psoriasis populations is not known.
Injection site reactions with 25 mg doses of etanercept
are mild, well tolerated, self-limiting, and tend to occur early
in the course of therapy (Zeltser et al 2001; Papp 2004).
Irritation during and brieﬂy following injection is very
common with the 50 mg single dose compared with the 25
mg dosing formulation. Occasionally, persistent reactions
of moderate severity are noted. Persistent reactions are
characterized by erythematous, indurated, and urticarial like
plaques (Edwards et al 2003). The histology of etanercept
injection site reactions is consistent with a delayed-type
hypersensitivity reaction (Werth and Levinson 2001; Zeltser
et al 2001). Delayed and recall injection site reactions are
infrequent but tend to be somewhat more severe than typical
etanercept-associated injection site reactions (Zeltser et al
2001; Rajakulendran and Deighton 2004). Signiﬁcant
and severe injection site reactions are rare with etanercept
regardless of dose (Papp 2004).
Infection
Clinical trials and post-marketing experience suggest that
infection is the most common signiﬁcant category of adverse
events experienced by patients treated with etanercept. Less
common infections including tuberculosis and opportunistic
infections, speciﬁcally histoplasmosis and listeriosis, are
considered separately.
TNF is involved in the immune response to bacterial
and viral infections (Imanishi 2000; Herbein and O’Brien
2000). More speciﬁcally, TNF plays an essential role in
host response to intracellular pathogens (Choy and Panayi
2001). The important role of TNF in immune response to
intracellular organisms is further supported by TNF-deﬁcient
animal models (Marino et al 1997). For Gram-positive and
Gram-negative infections, clearance of organisms may
be impeded by TNF-suppression (Takashima et al 1997;
O’Brien et al 1999; Rijneveld et al 2003; Moore et al 2003,
2005). Clinical studies, registries, and case reports conﬁrm
that host response to infection is the most common signiﬁcant
safety concern in patients treated with etanercept.
Serious infection is deﬁned within studies and for safety
monitoring as one requiring intravenous antibiotics or
hospitalization (Keystone 2004). The incidence of serious
infections in patients treated with etanercept varies according
to the population treated, severity of disease, concomitant
medication, and adherence to a deﬁnition of serious infection.
Some report serious infections as those requiring systemic
therapy.
During the clinical trial development of etanercept, the
observed serious infection rate in the RA population was
0.03–0.04 serious infectious events per patient-year (SIE/
pt-yr), equal to rates seen in placebo controls (Cush 2004a
2004b). Post-marketing surveillance across all indicated
diseases has shown the rates of SIE with etanercept and
inﬂiximab to be 0.007 SIE/pt-yr (conﬁdence interval [CI]
0.03–0.09/pt-yr). Signiﬁcant under-reporting with post-
marketing surveillance is expected but confounding effects
include a less well deﬁned treated population, inclusion of
indications other than those reported in the clinical studies,
and thus these rates may be substantially more common in
the RA population (Cush 2004a, 2004b).
Within the RA population, an increased risk of
serious infection is seen in patients having extra-articular
manifestations of RA, presence of comorbid diseases, and
immunosuppressive therapy (Doran et al 2002a). These
infections tend to be upper respiratory, skin, and urinary
tract infections.

the risk of infection in the RA population. Reports of

patient-years during an 18 month period show that etanercept
had a rate of 22.6 (18.7–27.2) events per hundred years
compared with controls (those receiving disease modifying
and remitting drugs [DMARDs]) with a rate of 6.8 (5.0–9.4)
per hundred patient years (Listing et al 2005). The rates
for serious infections were 6.4 (4.5–9.1) and 2.3 (1.3–3.9)
for etanercept and control groups respectively. Adjusting for
case-patient mix, the rates of serious infection were similar
for etanercept and inﬂiximab. These results suggest there
is an increased risk of infection in those treated with TNF-
antagonists. This study is limited by small numbers, a short
observation period, and bias in populations: those on anti-
TNF cannot be the same population as those on DMARDs
since general patients with more severe disease are treated
with TNF-antagonists, which introduces potential bias in the
study populations.
It is certain that TNF-antagonists exacerbate septicemia
with increase in mortality among septic patients on etanercept
(Fisher et al 1996; Baghai et al 2001).
Patients developing new infections while on etanercept
should be closely monitored and discontinued in those with
serious infections or sepsis. Etanercept should not be initiated
in patients with active infections including chronic or local-
ized infections. Caution should be exercised when initiating
etanercept in patients with a history of or predisposition to
frequent recurrent infections.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Susceptibility to mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) impacted
by multiple factors including age, environment, immune
status, and microbial virulence (Mitsos et al 2003) and
genetic susceptibility (Abel and Casanova 2000; Casanova
and Abel 2002). Latent tuberculosis remains a signiﬁcant
global health concern with nearly 30% of the world
population infected (Jasmer et al 2002). TNF is necessary
for cell recruitment, granuloma formation, and clearance of
mycobacterial infection (Roach et al 2002). Recent clinical
results demonstrating reactivation of latent TB in patients
receiving anti-TNF monoclonal antibody therapy solidiﬁes
the importance of TNF in host response to TB (Keane et al
2001; Keane 2004, 2005).
The role of TNF in initial host response and subsequent
conﬁnement of TB organisms is complex and not completely
elucidated. TNF regulates chemokine induction that in turn
orchestrates cell recruitment, granuloma formation, and
clearance of mycobacterial infection (Roach et al 2002;
Stenger 2005). Mice lacking TNF mount delayed chemokine
response and cellular inﬁltrate. Subsequent high chemokine
production produced disorganized T-cell and macrophage
responses capable of producing high levels of interferon-
gamma but unable to protect against fatal TB infections 28
days post inoculation. Wild mouse strains survived 16 weeks
or longer. The response of TNF-deﬁcient mice exposed to
mycobacteria anticipates the prominent role TNF plays in the
initial response to infection and subsequent maintenance of
granulomas. In large part, mortality results from unchecked
type-1 inﬂammatory response producing tissue necrosis
(Zganiacz et al 2004). Animal models also suggest there
are differences in the activity of membrane-bound and -free
TNF in acute and chronic response to TB (Olleros et al 2005;
Saunders et al 2005). TNF is also required to maintain latency
of TB (Botha and Ryffel 2003). Thus, the role of TNF in
immune response to TB is poly-modal: initiate inﬂammatory
response, regulate and suppress the inﬂammatory response,
and maintain chronic immunological response.
RA patients on etanercept showed a linear incidence
of TB infection (Wallis et al 2004a, 2004b) suggesting
that acquisition of TB was related to exposure and not
re-activation of latent infection. Inﬂiximab-treated patients
demonstrated an accelerated incidence of TB infection in
keeping with activation of latent disease (Wallis et al 2004a,
2004b). While the incidence of TB in patients on etanercept
may not be signiﬁcantly greater than the background rate,
treatment with etanercept does alter the clinical presentation
of TB (Arend et al 2003; Gardam et al 2003). Approximately
half of patients treated with etanercept who develop clinical
TB present with extra-pulmonary manifestations including
disseminated TB. The expected rate of extra-pulmonary
TB in immunocompetent hosts is less than 15% (Dye et al
1999).
In summary, there is no scientiﬁc data in support of
screening for latent TB prior to initiating therapy with
etanercept. However, patients treated with etanercept who
acquire infection with TB are more likely to have atypical
presenting signs and symptoms. Etanercept-treated patients
developing TB may be at increased risk of severe and
potentially fatal infection. Screening for active TB with a
chest X-ray is medically prudent. A more cautious approach
is to screen for latent and active TB by chest X-ray (CXR)
and tuberculin (PPD) testing prior to initiating etanercept
in patients at high risk. Based upon minimal data, but
highlighting the need for extreme safety, some suggest a
CXR and PPD prior to introducing any immunosuppressive
treatment (CDC 2004; Keane 2005).
Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management 2007:3(2) 249
Safety of etanercept for the treatment of plaque psoriasis
Opportunistic infections
Opportunistic infections occur in patients on TNF-blocking
agents (Jarvis and Faulds 1999; Garrison and McDonnell
1999; Mease et al 2000; Doran et al 2002a, 2002b; Netea
et al 2003; Elkayam et al 2004), but these are rare (Keystone
2004).
Histoplasmosis is an uncommon opportunistic infection
endemic to many regions of the world (Cano and Hajjeh
2001). Normal host defense to infection is dependent upon
TNF expression (Smith et al 1990; Zhou et al 1998). Infection
with histoplasmosis may be exacerbated in patients on therapy
with TNF-antagonists, but lack of control comparators and
cases occurring in histoplasmosis-endemic regions of the
US make any conclusions tentative (Lee et al 2002). Less
certain is the question of risk of reactivation of latent infection
with histoplasmosis. This uncertainty is highlighted by
reports of disseminated histoplasmosis occurring in patients
on low-dose methotrexate (Berry 1969; Witty et al 1992;
LeMense and Sahn 1994; Voloshin et al 1995; Roy and
Hammerschmidt 2000; Arunkumar et al 2004).
Listeria monocytogenes is an uncommon but ubiquitous,
opportunistic, intracellular pathogen causing gastroenteritis,
meningitis, encephalitis, and septicemia (Hamon et al
2006). TNF is essential to effect normal host response to
listeria (Havell, 1989, Rothe et al 1993; Kanaly et al 1999;
Dinarello 2003; Torres et al 2005) and treatment with
etanercept may predispose patients to infection (Schett et al
2005). Infection with listeria is reported in patients treated
with TNF-antagonists and particularly etanercept (Slifman
et al 2003; Ehlers 2005; La Montagna and Valentini 2005;
Nadarajah and Pritchard 2005; Rachapalli and O’Daunt 2005;
Schett et al 2005). What is not evident is whether there is a
real increased risk of infection or a modiﬁcation of clinical
presentation and host response (Pagliano et al 2004). Given
that etanercept does affect lymphotoxin (Williams and
Grifﬁths 2002) and that lymphotoxin is essential in providing
normal immune response to listeria (Ehlers et al 2003), the
possible increased susceptibility to infection with listeria
must be considered.
Rare cases of disseminated sporotrichosis further stress
the importance of TNF in maintaining normal host response
to infections (Gottlieb et al 2003).
Vaccination
TNF plays a signiﬁcant role in immune response to pathogens
(Herbein and O’Brien 2000) and may therefore modulate
host response to vaccination. A number of studies have
evaluated response to inﬂuenza vaccine in RA patients treated
with etanercept. In general, response to inﬂuenza vaccine is
blunted but not completely suppressed (Fomin et al 2006).
The addition of methotrexate further suppresses the response
to vaccination (Kapetanovic et al 2006).
Malignancy exclusive of lymphoma
The role of TNF in carcinogenicity and tumor surveillance
has not been established. Early cell culture studies indicated
that TNF is cytotoxic for certain tumor cell lines (Old 1985;
Creasey et al 1986; Palladino, Patton, et al 1987; Palladino,
Srivastava, et al 1987). Subsequent studies revealed that, for
certain types of malignancies, TNF may act as a growth factor
(Freedman et al 1992; Warzocha et al 1995; Filella et al 1996;
Warzocha and Salles 1998; Warzocha, Bienvenu, et al 1998;
Warzocha, Ribero, et al 1998; Renard et al 1999; Moore
et al 1999) and may even enhance the metastatic potential of
certain tumors (Balkwill et al 1990; Malik et al 1990).
Review of the clinical studies and registries for TNF-
antagonists shows no increase in the incidence of solid tumors
in the RA population (Keystone 2003, 2005). Likewise, in
the clinical studies evaluating etanercept for the treatment of
psoriasis, there is no evidence of increased risk of malignancy
(Leonardi et al 2003; Papp 2004; Papp et al 2005). The
potential for increased risk of solid tumors in patients
receiving concurrent etanercept and alkylating agents must
be considered (Mukhtyar and Luqmani 2005; WGET 2005;
Hellmich et al 2006; Stone et al 2006). There are cases of
rapidly developing squamous cell carcinomas in RA patients
initiating therapy with etanercept (Smith and Skelton 2001).
To the contrary, TNF-alpha deﬁcient mice are resistant to
cutaneous carcinogenesis (Arnott et al 2002).
Lymphoma
Thereisastrongassociationofnon-Hodgkin’slymphomawith
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and immunosuppression
(Liebowitz 1998; Meyer et al 2004; Poppema 2005).
Approximately 95% of adults are infected with EBV. Many
develop subclinical reactivation (Rickinson and Kieff 1996).
Members of the TNF superfamily of receptors play a role
in pathogenesis of EBV-positive lymphomas arising in
immunosupressed patients, but the role of TNF-alpha is not
established (Liebowitz 1998; Herbein and O’Brien 2000).
Chronic inﬂammation produces elevated TNF levels, which
in turn produce indirect alterations in immunological function
(Khan 2006; Weyand et al 2006) and modulatory effects
of TNF on T-cell surveillance (Baran-Marszak et al 2006).
Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management 2007:3(2)250
Papp
Confounding the role of TNF in the develoment of lymphoma
is the association of chronic inﬂammatory processes and
lymphoma (Kato et al 2003; Chang et al 2005). The potential
association of TNF, TNF-antagonism, and the development
of lymphomas is confounded by epidemiologic surveys
showing a strong trend in risk in patients with psoriasis
(Hannuksela-Svahn et al 2000; Gelfand et al 2003, 2006)
though these ﬁndings are not substantiated by larger surveys
(Smedby et al 2006). The association of lymphoma and
rheumatoid arthritis appear more certain (Baecklund et al
1998, 2003, 2004, 2006; Ekstrom et al 2003).
There are case reports of lymphoma developing in
patients receiving TNF-antagonists (Brown et al 2002). Of
the 26 cases reported, 18 developed in patients on etanercept.
The mean time to onset of lesions after commencing therapy
was 8 weeks. Data from an RA registry suggests an increased
risk of lymphoma in patients treated with TNF-antagonists
or methotrexate compared with those who are not (Wolfe
and Michaud 2004b). There is; however, a strong selection
bias in that those receiving anti-TNF therapy tend to be the
most severely affected patients, a cohort already known to
have a greater risk of lymphoma (Baecklund et al 1998)
and that the strongest association is not with therapy but the
underlying RA itself (Baecklund et al 2006). In addition, two
cases of cutaneous and systemic T-cell lymphoma progressed
rapidly after initiating TNF-blockade: one with etanercept
and one with inﬂiximab (Adams et al 2004). Both cases
were described as rapid in onset with fulminate courses:
extensive cutaneous, and systemic involvement resulting in
death within months of diagnosis.
While there are numerous case reports of lymphoma
developing in patients treated with etanercept, the relative
risk of lymphoma remains constant for RA patients regardless
of therapy with TNF-antagonists (Keystone 2005). The high
incidence of lymphoma in RA patients makes risk assessment
complex. The lower incidence of lymphoma in the psoriasis
population may be instrumental in the assessment of risk
associated with long-term treatment with etanercept.
Central nervous system
demyelination events
We have some understanding of the incidence of multiple
sclerosis (MS) in the general population: women more com-
monly affected, there are regional variations in incidence
and prevalence (Ebers and Sadovnick, 1993, Magnano et al
2004). Incidence in the general population is approximately 6
per 100 000 per year with a prevalence of nearly 85/100 000.
An increased in risk of MS is reported in individuals with
affected ﬁrst degree relatives (Sadovnick et al 1993).
MS is uncommon. Furthermore, assessments may be
complicated as not all instances of magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) ﬁndings consistent with demyelination are
MS (Koller et al 2005a). Instances of chronic, inﬂammatory,
demyelinating polyneuropathy are usually peripheral,
but may include cortical and optic nerve demyelination.
Interestingly, MS appears to be a Th1 disorder mediated by
cytokines including TNF and evinces many of the pathogenic
pathways active in psoriasis (Koller et al 2005b).
TheputativerelationshipsbetweenTNF,TNF-antagonism,
and MS are not obvious. Many theoretical reasons support
TNF-antagonist activity induces demyelization (Magnano
et al 2004). Equally supportive arguments support the
contrary: TNF-antagonism does not increase the risk of MS
and may potentially be of therapeutic value (Magnano et al
2004). Reporting bias of case reports (Magnano et al 2004)
and potential association with other autoimmune diseases
(Midgard et al 1996) confound the role of TNF-antagonist
therapy in the onset or exacerbation of MS.
Much of the current concern over TNF-antagonism
and MS results from a single study evaluating lenercept; a
p55, recombinant, soluble TNFR1 receptor protein, for the
treatment of relapsing-remitting and secondarily progressive
MS (LMS-UBC 1999). The study found no increase in new
or active lesions as demonstrated on MRI. However, there
was a signiﬁcant dose-related increase of attack frequency
though not attack severity nor attack duration. The contrary
response of MS patients treated with lenercept underscores
the difﬁculty in extrapolating results from animal models.
Antibodies to lenercept did not affect clinical response but
did increase rate of drug clearance (Wiendl and Hohlfeld
2002). Two cases of MS patients treated with inﬂiximab
demonstrated increased MRI activity but no clinical
worsening (van Oosten et al 1996).
The rarity of MS in psoriasis patients treated with
etanercept is highlighted by the rarity of case reports (Sukal
et al 2006). From the rheumatology literature, there are
cases temporally related to TNF-suppression, some of which
resolved upon withdrawal of treatment (Mohan et al 2001).
MS remains rare and of uncertain causal association with
anti-TNF therapy (Mohan et al 2001; Magnano et al 2004).
Many but not all patients develop recurrent symptoms on
re-challenge (Mohan et al 2001; Cisternas et al 2002).
There is growing concern among some groups of
neurologists who suggest pretreatment MRI scans for all
Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management 2007:3(2) 251
Safety of etanercept for the treatment of plaque psoriasis
patients about to receive a TNF-antagonists (Bellesi et al
2006). Currently, etanercept should be avoided in patients
with a personal history of any central nervous system
demyelinating disorder and used with caution in patients
with a family history of these disorders. Pretreatment MRI
may be considered in patients with equivocal histories of
neuropathy or signs or symptoms of demyelination and ﬁrst
degree family histories of MS.
Hematological events
Rare cases of pancytopenia and aplastic anemia are reported
in association with etanercept (Lebwohl 2002). A fatal
outcome is reported in some cases (Jarvis and Faulds 1999;
Khanna et al 2004). Nonetheless, it is important to review
drug and medical history to exclude other potential causes
of myelosuppression (Baumelou et al 1993; Marshall et al
2006).
Hepatitis
TNF plays a role in host response to hepatitis B and C (Herbein
and O’Brien 2000). With 1.8% of the world population
infected with hepatitis C virus and 5% infected with hepatitis
B, the potential for exacerbation of viral hepatitis associated
with TNF-antagonist therapy is noteworthy. While TNF does
play a role in viral hepatic infection, the importance of TNF
in maintaining suppression of viral replication is not clear
(Calabrese et al 2004).
Mixed reports on response of patients with hepatitis B
treated with anti-TNF agents correlates with the natural,
variable history of the infection (Khanna et al 2003;
Calabrese et al 2004; Khanna et al 2004; Lok and McMahon
2004). Nonetheless, TNF plays a primary role in sustaining a
normal response to infection with hepatitis B (Schlaak et al
1999; Michel et al 2003; Ostuni et al 2003). Recently, Health
Canada issued an advisory related to possible reactivation
of hepatitis B in patients receiving anti-TNF therapy. The
advisory is based upon a single case report (HPB Canada
2006).
The mechanisms relating to reactivation of hepatitis B
are uncertain. Equally uncertain is the association between
treatment with TNF-antagonists or other immunosuppressant
and hepatitis B reactivation. More likely is reaction upon drug
discontinuation or rebound with replication of hepatitis B
in hepatocytes upon discontinuation of immunosuppressive
therapy (Herbein and O’Brien 2000).
It is suggested that antiviral therapy be initiated prior to
initiation of immunosuppressive treatment or to introduce
antiviral therapy upon activation of hepatitis (de Franchis
et al 2003).
Hepatitis C appears to follow more consistent patterns of
infection characteristic of its natural course (Calabrese et al
2004). A small group of hepatitis C-positive RA patients
were administered etanercept or inﬂiximab for periods of
3–36 months. None of the patients showed changes in liver
enzymes or viral loads (Zein and Zein 2002; Peterson et al
2003).
Elevated liver enzymes may be observed in patients
receiving anti-TNF therapy but these observations are
confounded by medications or circumstances making the
aetiology of elevations uncertain (Schiemann and Kellner
2002; Khanna et al 2003, 2004).
The data currently available suggest etanerecept is
unlikely to have negative impact and may be protective
against morbidity associated with chronic hepatitis C
infection. Morbidity associated with chronic infection with
hepatitis B virus in the face of treatment with etanercept is not
well characterized. Prudent medical practice would support
screening for hepatitis B infection prior to commencing
therapy with etanercept.
Lupus-like drug reactions
Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-DNA antibodies
develop in RA patients treated with etanercept (Watts 2000;
De Bandt et al 2003, 2005; Haraoui and Keystone 2006).
There also appears to be an increase in anticardiolipin
expression in RA patients after 6 months of etanercept
(Jonsdottir et al 2004). While serum antibodies are rarely
associated with symptoms, there are few cases of etanercept-
induced lupus erythematosus (Cairns et al 2002; Shakoor
et al 2002; Carlson and Rothfield 2003). In general,
etanercept-induced lupus resolves within 6 weeks to 14
months of discontinuation of therapy (Mohan et al 2002).
Most frequently, the presentation has signs and symptoms
of sub-acute cutaneous lupus (Bleumink et al 2001; Misery
et al 2002). Overall, drug-induced lupus appears to be less
common in patients treated with etanercept compared with
those treated with other TNF-antagonists (Cush 2004c).
There are no surveys indicating the prevalence of ANA
and anti-DNA antibodies in the psoriasis population and no
data from large clinical studies or registries identifying the
risk of autoantibody formation in psoriasis patients treated
with etanercept. Personal experience suggests that somewhat
less than 10% of psoriasis patients become ANA positive
during the ﬁrst two or three years of treatment. While the
Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management 2007:3(2)252
Papp
ANA titres are in generally low: less than 1:40, higher titres
are observed.
Given the overall lack of association between positive
ANA and DNA titres in the general population and those
treated with etanercept, screening for autoantibodies prior
to treatment with etanercept is unwarranted. However,
unless there is exceeding good communication between the
dermatologist and other healthcare providers, the authors
feel it useful to have a baseline screen for ANA titres with
annual or every two year tests for ANA to reduce the risk
of other healthcare professionals initiating costly diagnostic
procedures based upon incidental and clinically unimportant
laboratory results.
Cutaneous reactions
Leukocytoclastic vasculitis has been reported in patients
treated with etanercept. Some instances resolve spontaneously
while on therapy. Results are mixed on re-challenge with
instances of recurrence while others are not (Galaria et al
2000; Mohan et al 2004). The underlying mechanism and
association are not clear.
Cases of urticaria have been reported in associated with
etanercept (Skytta et al 2000). Possibly more uncommon are
cases of psoriasis induced by treatment of RA with etanercept
(Sﬁkakis et al 2005).
Cardiovascular
Congestive heart failure
We do not know the underlying incidence of congestive
heart failure (CHF) in the general psoriasis population.
More speciﬁcally, we do not know the incidence of CHF in
the population of patients with moderate to severe plaque
psoriasis. There were no cases of CHF in the 6 months
etanercept-psoriasis studies (Leonardi et al 2003; Papp 2004;
Papp et al 2005). It has been reported that 51 RA patients
treated with TNF-antagonists developed CHF (FDA 2003).
The mean time to onset was 3.5 months post initiation of
therapy. At least half of the cases had pre-existing risk
factors for CHF. However, there are data showing that
polymorphisms in the promoter region of the TNF gene are
associated with cardiovascular complications (Elahi and
Matata 2005).
Biologically, there is evidence to support the use of
TNF-antagonists for the treatment of CHF (Torre-Amione
et al 2000; Cush 2004c). A study to evaluate 3 months of
therapy with etanercept for the treatment of New York Heart
Association (NYHA) III-IV CHF showed a significant
dose-dependent improvement in left ventricular structure
and function and a trend towards improvement in patient
functional status (Bozkurt et al 2001). A study assessing
etanercept at 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg weekly for the treatment
of NYHA III-IV CHF was stopped prematurely owing to
prespeciﬁed stopping rules supporting lack of efﬁcacy. There
was no evidence of worsening of outcome, but neither was
there relevant beneﬁt on rate of death or hospitalization
(Mann et al 2004).
Subsequently,MedWatchreported47patientsexperiencing
new or worsening CHF on anti-TNF therapy: 38 developed
new-onset (26 etanercept, 12 infliximab); 19 had no
identiﬁable risk factors (12 etanercept and 7 inﬂiximab); 9
experienced exacerbation (3 etanercept, 6 inﬂiximab) (Kwon
et al 2003). Of those patients with new onset CHF, 29 were
receiving treatment for RA, six for Crohn’s Disease, one for
psoriatic arthritis, one for juvenile RA, and one unknown.
Evidence from Arthritis Research Center Foundation
registry suggests etanercept may reduce risk of CHF in
patients with RA compared with patients not receiving anti-
TNF therapy (Wolfe and Michaud 2004a). Overall, heart
failure was signiﬁcantly less common in patients receiving
anti-TNF therapy than in other patients (p < 0.05). There
was no increase in heart failure observed among patients
younger than 50 years.
There is currently insufﬁcient evidence to ascribe a causal
association between etanercept and CHF. Evidence from
limited clinical studies of patients suffering severe CHF and
data from long-term registries suggest no association with
the onset of CHF and the use of etanercept. On the contrary,
there is evidence supporting a beneﬁcial effect on CHF in
patients treated with etanercept.
Cautionary notes
Wound healing
In a small series of 31 patients with RA undergoing foot or
ankle surgery, the use of etanercept or inﬂiximab (15 of the 31
patients were treated with standard DMARD therapies) was
not associated with an increased risk of post-surgical wound
healing or infection (Bibbo and Goldberg 2004). Nonetheless,
caution and evaluation of risk-beneﬁt must be considered
when patients on etanercept undergo elective surgery.
Insulin resistance and diabetes
Population studies (Zinman et al 1999) and genetic studies
(Obayashi et al 2000; Rasmussen et al 2000) suggest TNF-
alpha concentrations may play a pathophysiological role in
Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management 2007:3(2) 253
Safety of etanercept for the treatment of plaque psoriasis
and are positively correlated with insulin resistance. Though
no severe episodes of hypoglycemia were reported in clinical
studies evaluating etanercept, appropriate precautions are
advisable when introducing anti-TNF therapy in patients
with insulin resistance.
Breast feeding and pregnancy
Detectable levels of etanercept are found in breast milk
(Ostensen and Eigenmann 2004). The clinical signiﬁcance
of this observation is unknown and complicated by the low
gastric proteolytic activity in preterm infants and newborns
(Hamosh 1996; Henderson et al 2001).
In mice, TNF plays an essential role in implantation
(Tartakovsky and Ben-Yair 1991). Elevated levels of TNF-
alpha have been associated with recurrent spontaneous
abortions and infertility (Daher et al 1999; Murakami
et al 2002). While there are theoretical concerns regarding
implantation and ovulation, there is no evidence supporting
altered fertility in humans treated with etanercept and
likewise no evidence for embryotoxicity or teratogenicity
(Khanna et al 2004).
Summary
Characterizing the safety of etanercept in patients with
psoriasis is neither simple nor complete. Long term risk
associated with use of etanercept will require vigilance
(Imperato et al 2004). The identiﬁcation of rare events
requires exposure of tens and hundreds of thousands of
patients. The current state of information suggests three broad
categories of concern.
Patients receiving etanercept are more prone to infections.
The majority of infections are mild: upper respiratory tract
infections localized cutaneous abscesses, and cold-like
illnesses. Patients may have increased susceptibility to
infections by intracellular organisms particularly listeria
and tuberculsosis. Reactivation of latent infection is not yet
supportable. Those acquiring tuberculosis are at increased
risk of presenting with atypical or disseminated infection.
Patients who become septic and are receiving etanercept are
at greater risk of fatality than those who are not.
Prior to instituting therapy with etanercept, a review
of risks should be completed. An outline is provided in
Table 1. Suggestions for monitoring therapy are outlined in
Table 2. Precautions should be maintained during therapy
with routine laboratory testing and patient review with special
regard to signs and symptoms of infection or adverse effects
exacerbated by treatment with etanercept. Patients should be
reminded to discontinue therapy with etanercept when treated
with antibiotics. Patients should also be aware of the reduced
efﬁcacy of vaccination while on treatment with etanercept.
