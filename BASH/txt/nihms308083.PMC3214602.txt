Abstract
Primary graft failure after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is a life-threatening
complication. A shortened conditioning regimen may reduce the risk of infection and increase the
chance of survival. Here, we report the outcome of 11 patients with hematologic diseases (median
age, 44; range, 25–67 years, 7 males) who received a 1-day reduced-intensity preparative regimen
given as a re-transplantation for primary graft failure. The salvage regimen consisted of
fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, alemtuzumab, and total-body irradiation, all administered 1 day
before re-transplantation. All patients received T-cell replete peripheral blood stem cells from the
same or different haploidentical donor (n = 10) or from the same matched sibling donor (n = 1).
Neutrophil counts promptly increased to >500/µL for 10 of the 11 patients at a median of 13 days.
Of these, none developed Grade III/IV acute graft-versus-host disease. At present, 8 of the 11
patients are alive with a median follow-up of 11.2 months from re-transplantation and 5 of the 8
are in remission. In conclusion, this series suggests that our 1-day preparative regimen is feasible,
leads to successful engraftment in a high proportion of patients, and is appropriate for patients
requiring immediate re-transplantation after primary graft failure following reduced-intensity
transplantation.

INTRODUCTION
Primary graft failure after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is a life-threatening
complication because patients are at a high risk of severe infection owing to prolonged
neutropenia after the initial transplantation. Several risk factors for graft failure have been
suggested: transplantation of inadequate stem cell doses,1 use of human leukocyte antigen
(HLA)-mismatched donors2–4 or cord blood units,5–7 viral infections such as
cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6),8–10 use of a non-myeloablative

or reduced-intensity conditioning regimen,11,12 and presence of donor-specific HLA
antibody.13–15 Graft rejection due to the immune response of the recipient is a major
mechanism underlying graft failure. In cases of known immune-associated graft rejection, it
is thought that patients should again receive a preparative regimen to suppress the recipient-
derived immune system before re-transplantation. However, the appropriate regimen for re-
transplantation is currently unknown. Typical preparative regimens start about 5 days before
transplantation, and further delay an already prolonged recovery period. A shortened
conditioning regimen may reduce the risk of infection and increase the chance of survival.
Here, we report on 11 patients with hematologic disease (median age, 44; range, 25–67
years, 7 males and 4 females) who received a 1-day reduced-intensity preparative regimen
and re-transplantation after primary graft failure following mainly reduced-intensity
transplantation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
The retrospective study population comprised all of the 11 adult patients who received a 1-
day reduced-intensity preparative regimen and subsequent re-transplantation for primary
graft failure at Duke Medical Center from May 2008 to August 2010. The characteristics of
the patients are presented in Table 1. The median age of the patients was 44 (range, 25–67)
years. The patients had the following hematologic diseases: 5 had acute myelogenous
leukemia (AML) and were in complete remission, 1 had chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML) in the chronic phase, 1 had chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and was in partial
remission, 2 had myelofibrosis (MF) and 1 had myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) without a
history of cytotoxic chemotherapy, and 1 had severe aplastic anemia. The first donor was a
haploidentical (n = 6) or matched sibling related donor (n = 1), matched unrelated donor (n
= 2), or dual umbilical cord blood units (n = 2).
Primary transplant regimen
Fludarabine (160 mg/m2) and alemtuzumab (80mg) with i.v. busulfan (260 mg/m2) or
melphalan (140 mg/m2) was used as a reduced intensity regimen of T-cell replete peripheral
blood stem cell transplantation for hematologic malignancies (n = 7), but antithymocyte
globulin was used instead of alemtuzumab in one patient due to a physician’s preference.
Fludarabine (120 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (2 g/m2) with alemtuzumab (100 mg) was
used in transplantation for aplastic anemia (n = 1). Fludarabine (160 mg/m2) and total-body
irradiation (TBI) (1350 cGy) was used as a myeloablative conditioning regimen for dual
umbilical cord blood transplantation (n = 2) (Table 1).16
Salvage transplant regimen
The 1-day salvage regimen for graft failure rescue consisted of 30 mg/m2 fludarabine, 2 g/
m2 cyclophosphamide, 20 mg alemtuzumab intravenously, and 200 cGy TBI, all
administered 1 day before the transplantation (TBI was administered on the day prior for 2
patients, Cases 10 and 11, because of scheduling). Mobilized peripheral blood stem cells
were collected from donors via apheresis and transplanted fresh without ex vivo T-cell
depletion. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of 1000 mg
mycophenolate mofetil either 2 (n = 5; Cases 1, 2, 5, 8, and 10) or 3 (n = 6; Cases 3, 4, 6, 7,
and 11) times a day with cyclosporine (n = 10) or tacrolimus (n = 1, Case 7).
Assessment of engraftment and toxicity
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed 3–5 weeks after initial transplantation
to assess donor-cell engraftment or to determine the cause for the delayed neutrophil

recovery. Samples of bone marrow or peripheral blood were used to assess donor-cell
chimerism after re-transplantation. PCR amplification and subsequent size comparison of
multiple short tandem repeats was used to detect recipient and donor chimerism. Primary
graft failure was defined as failure of neutrophil counts to exceed 500/µL or absence of
donor-derived hematopoiesis (<5% donor cells). Toxicities were formally graded using
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). Acute and chronic
GVHD were diagnosed and graded using traditional criteria.17,18
Statistical analysis
Patients’ data as of December 2010 were analyzed. The number of CD34+ cell counts in the
first and second peripheral blood stem cell grafts was compared using Wilcoxon matched-
pairs signed-rank test. Overall survival was estimated using Kaplan–Meier methods and
STATA software version 11 (STATA Corp., College Station, TX, USA).
RESULTS
Patients and transplant characteristics
Although primary disease relapse and infections were extensively studied to determine the
cause for primary graft failure, a definitive cause could not be determined for most of the
patients (Table 1). The median number of CD34+ cells in peripheral blood stem cell grafts
was 12.8 (range, 4.51–22.92) × 106/kg. One patient (Case 4) experienced engraftment
failure likely related to adenovirus infection, diagnosed by real-time polymerase chain
reaction quantitation of adenovirus in the plasma (34,440 DNA copies/mL), whereas another
patient experienced failure owing to cytogenetic relapse of AML (Case 10). One patient
(Case 1) received a second transplant from a haploidentical donor after a conditioning
regimen consisting of alemtuzumab (20 mg/day from days −4 to 0), fludarabine (30 mg/m2
from days −5 to −2), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 from days −5 to −2), but the
engraftment failed.
The patients received grafts from haploidentical donors who were the same as (n = 5) or
different from (n = 5) the initial donors or from the same matched sibling donor (n = 1) after
the 1-day preparative regimen at a median of 35 (range, 30–91) days from the initial
transplantation (Table 2). The median number of CD34+ cells transplanted was 12.1 (range,
8.0–20.0) × 106/kg. There was no statistical difference in CD34+ cell counts between the
first and second peripheral blood stem cell grafts (P = 0.51). Neutrophil counts increased to
>500/µL in 10 of the 11 patients with a median of 13 (range, 9–26) days, whereas a white
blood cell (WBC) count of 500/µL and a neutrophil count of 325/µL with 80% chimerism of
donor CD3+ and CD15+ cells were achieved in the remaining patient (Case 2); however,
WBC gradually decreased to 0/µL without detection of any donor cell chimerism. This case
was subsequently rescued by autologous stem cell transplantation. Among the 10 patients
for whom neutrophil engraftment was achieved, donor chimerism was not analyzed in 2
patients (Cases 4 and 6) owing to deterioration of their clinical condition. One (Case 4) of
the 2 patients died 13 days after re-transplantation from a progressive adenovirus infection
that persisted before the start of the 1-day preparative regimen, whereas another patient
(Case 6) died 26 days after re-transplantation secondary to multi-organ failure. Complete
donor chimerism (>95%) was confirmed within 3 months for all the patients examined,
except 1 (Case 10), who achieved 80% donor cell chimerism until 2 months after re-
transplantation, when donor cell chimerism was gradually lost after a relapse of the primary
disease. In 1 patient with initial engraftment (Case 11), donor T cell microchimerism
decreased to 75% with a WBC count of 500/µL, a neutrophil count of 195/µL, and
hypocellular marrow at 3 months. This patient achieved complete donor cell chimerism and
stable engraftment after 2 Gy TBI and a subsequent boost of stem cells from the same donor.

Toxicities
This conditioning regime was well tolerated. None of the patients experienced severe nausea
or emesis. Two patients (Cases 2 and 8) developed renal insufficiency ranging from
creatinine 2.0 to 3.5 mg/dL 2 weeks after transplantation, but the value was almost
normalized 1 month after transplantation (Table 3). Four patients (Cases 1, 2, 5, and 8)
showed CMV reactivation, which were controllable by foscarnet treatment, and none
developed CMV disease. Four patients (Cases 3, 6, 10, and 11) developed polyoma virus-
related cystitis. Of these, 1 (Case 3) experienced urinary obstruction and subsequent multi-
organ failure and died, and 1 (Case 6) experienced severe bladder pain requiring
percutaneous nephrostomy. The latter patient (Case 6) also had multi-organ failure and died,
which was possibly triggered by pulmonary complications with unknown etiology.
Adenovirus infection progressed after re-transplantation in 1 patient (Case 4), leading to
death. Other viral infections included those cause by HHV-6 in 2 subjects (Cases 2 and 8),
influenza virus type A in 1 (Case 9), respiratory syncytial virus in 1 (Case 5), and herpes
simplex virus in 2 patients (Cases 3 and 4). None developed documented bacterial or fungal
infections.
Of the 8 individuals who achieved engraftment and survived >1 month, 2 developed Grade
II acute GVHD, and 2 developed Grade I acute GVHD (Table 3). No patient developed
Grade III or IV acute GVHD. One patient (Case 5) developed lung complications possibly
caused by extensive chronic GVHD, and 3 patients (Cases 8, 10, and 11) developed limited
chronic GVHD.
At present, 8 of the 11 patients survive with a median follow-up of 11.2 (range, 4.2–30.0)
months from the 1-day preparative regimen and re-transplantation, and 5 of the 8 are in
remission. The overall survival rate at 1 year was 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.37–0.90)
(Figure 1).
DISCUSSION
We report 11 patients with primary graft failure who received a 1-day reduced-intensity
preparative regimen and underwent subsequent re-transplantation using a T-cell replete
peripheral blood stem cell graft, mainly from haploidentical donors. Neutrophil counts
increased >500/µL in 10 of the 11 patients, and 7 of 8 evaluable patients achieved complete
donor chimerism. No patients developed Grade III or IV acute GVHD. At present, 8 of the
11 patients are alive with a median follow-up of 11.2 (range, 4.2–30.0) months from re-
transplantation. These findings suggest that the 1-day preparative regimen is an encouraging
option for treatment of patients with graft failure following reduced-intensity
transplantation.
We first developed the 1-day preparative regimen for initial transplantation from related
haploidentical donors and reported neutrophil engraftment in 3 of 5 patients.19 To establish
another regimen that potentially offered higher engraftment after haploidentical
transplantation, we used a 5-day preparative regimen consisting of 100 mg alemtuzumab (20
mg/day from days −4 to 0), 120 mg/m2 fludarabine (30 mg/m2 from days −5 to −2), and
2000 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 from days −5 to −2) to intensify the
immunosuppressive effects, and obtained an acceptable graft failure rate (primary graft
failure, 6%; secondary graft failure, 8%) for haploidentical transplantation.20 This 5-day
preparative regimen was also effective for re-transplantation after primary and secondary
graft failure.21 However, this regimen requires more days from the graft failure diagnosis
and re-transplantation decision to the day of re-transplantation; therefore, we employed the
1-day preparative regimen to treat patients with graft failure. In the condition in which the
first preparative regimen might have already suppressed the recipient immune systems to

some extent, the 1-day preparative regimen was effective and a high engraftment rate was
achieved. This finding suggests that the 1-day preparative regimen, employed early in the
recovery time course as soon as primary graft failure is identified, is a promising strategy for
re-transplantation. However it should be noted that our salvage preparative regimen was
shown to be safe and effective mainly in the primary graft failure following reduced-
intensity conditioning regimen using alemtuzumab and salvage haploidentical
transplantation. Therefore, further study is warranted to confirm our findings and extend the
indication of our regimen to graft failure following myeloablative regimen or salvage
transplantation from other stem cell sources.
Sumi et al.22 from Japan have employed our 1-day preparative regimen after modification
(30 mg/m2 fludarabine for 1 to 3 days, 2 g/m2 cyclophosphamide, and 200 cGy TBI). They
performed salvage single cord blood (n = 5) and matched sibling (n = 1) transplantation for
patients with primary and secondary graft failure following single cord blood
transplantation. All patients experienced successful engraftment, with neutrophil counts of
>500/µL at a median of 24 (range, 18–26) day after the salvage cord blood transplantation,
supporting the feasibility of the 1-day preparative regimen and successful engraftment in
transplantation. The main difference from our salvage strategy is the omission of
alemtuzumab from the conditioning regimen and the use of single cord blood unit.
Alemtuzumab may not be required in the conditioning regimen for salvage single cord blood
transplantation, based on the fact that the cord blood transplantation was being performed
without in vivo T-cell depletion in many centers.7,16,23
For primary graft failure, immediate transplantation is essential because prolonged
neutropenia exposes patients to infection-related death. Available related donors such as
haploidentical donors are a suitable option because rapid neutrophil engraftment has been
reported.2,20,24 Our earlier study showed that neutrophil engraftment was achieved at a
median of 9 days.20 A shorter duration of neutropenia would greatly help reduce the risk of
bacterial and fungal infections. In fact, successful re-transplantation by using a
haploidentical donor after graft failure has been shown by several case studies.25–28
Furthermore, stem cell boosts with or without the use of a preparative regimen can be
performed in cases of insufficient donor cell engraftment after re-transplantation. In our
case, 1 patient who had initial engraftment after re-transplantation but gradually lost donor
chimerism (donor T cell chimerism of 75% and hypocellular marrow of ≤5%) experienced
successful engraftment after 200 cGy TBI and stem cell boosts from the same matched
sibling donor. Although prompt engraftment can be achieved after haploidentical
transplantation, one concern associated with haploidentical donors is the risk of developing
severe acute GVHD.3,4 Interestingly, after our 1-day preparative regimen with only 20 mg
of alemtuzumab and a GVHD prophylaxis consisting of mycophenolate mofetil and
calcineurin inhibitors, no patients developed grade III or IV acute GVHD. This can be
partially explained by the remaining alemtuzumab administered for the initial
transplantation at the time of re-transplantation. Although we did not measure the
concentration of alemtuzumab, Morris et al.29 examined 10 patients who received reduced-
intensity conditioning consisting of 100 mg of alemtuzumab and reported that the
concentration of alemtuzumab decreased to less than one-tenth of the peak level at day 28
after transplantation, but still remained at the lympholytic level of >0.5 µg/mL in 7 of the 10
patients. Therefore, administration of 20mg alemtuzumab may be adequate to suppress
severe acute GVHD. Viral infection is a concern inherent to T-cell-depleted haploidentical
transplantation.2–4 The development of modified donor T-cell infusions such as infusions of
antigen-specific T-cells30,31 and donor T-cells depleted of CD8 T-cells or alloreactive T-
cells32–34 could help improve immune recovery and clinical outcomes after transplantation.

Umbilical cord blood transplantation is another option for the treatment of graft failure
because it can be rapidly performed if appropriate cord blood units are available. Recently,
Waki et al.35 surveyed the data of 80 adult patients who received reduced-intensity cord
blood transplantation for primary (n = 64) or secondary (n = 16) graft failure and reported
that 45 (56%) of the 80 patients (74% of 61 patients who survived at least 28 days) achieved
engraftment at a median of 3 weeks after re-transplantation. Although engraftment in cord
blood transplantation is delayed as compared with that in haploidentical transplantation,
cord blood units are a potential option for re-transplantation.
This shortened salvage regimen has another advantage. Often, there are cases of primary
graft failure wherein the physicians and/or patients choose to wait for an additional few days
to confirm graft failure and hesitate to start cytotoxic preparative regimen even though
engraftment is unlikely. An abbreviated regimen made it possible to observe and wait until 1
day before the planned re-transplantation.
In conclusion, although the number of cases is small, this series suggests that our 1-day
preparative regimen is feasible, leads to successful engraftment in a high proportion of
patients, and is appropriate for patients requiring immediate re-transplantation. Since our
salvage preparative regimen was shown to be safe and effective mainly in the primary graft
failure following reduced-intensity conditioning, additional studies are warranted to confirm
our findings.
