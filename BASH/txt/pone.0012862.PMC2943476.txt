Abstract
Background: The human mitochondrial genome includes only 13 coding genes while nuclear-encoded genes account for
99% of proteins responsible for mitochondrial morphology, redox regulation, and energetics. Mitochondrial pathogenesis
occurs in HIV patients and genetically, mitochondrial DNA haplogroups with presumed functional differences have been
associated with differential AIDS progression.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we explore whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 904 of the
estimated 1,500 genes that specify nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (NEMPs) influence AIDS progression among
HIV-1 infected patients. We examined NEMPs for association with the rate of AIDS progression using genotypes generated
by an Affymetrix 6.0 genotyping array of 1,455 European American patients from five US AIDS cohorts. Successfully
genotyped SNPs gave 50% or better haplotype coverage for 679 of known NEMP genes. With a Bonferroni adjustment for
the number of genes and tests examined, multiple SNPs within two NEMP genes showed significant association with AIDS
progression: acyl-CoA synthetase medium-chain family member 4 (ACSM4) on chromosome 12 and peroxisomal D3,D2-enoyl-
CoA isomerase (PECI) on chromosome 6.
Conclusions: Our previous studies on mitochondrial DNA showed that European haplogroups with presumed functional
differences were associated with AIDS progression and HAART mediated adverse events. The modest influences of nuclear-
encoded mitochondrial genes found in the current study add support to the idea that mitochondrial function plays a role in
AIDS pathogenesis.

Introduction
The main function of mitochondria is to produce energy via
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS); however, they also perform
several other tasks critical for proper cell functioning including
regulation of apoptosis, production of radical oxygen species (ROS),
and other cell-type specific metabolic processes such as cholesterol
biosynthesis or hormone production. Thus, if mitochondria processes
are disrupted, not only energy production, but also cell-specific
products needed for normal cell functioning will be affected.
Research on HIV-infected CD4-T cells indicates that the virus
disrupts a number of mitochondrial pathways including cholesterol
biosynthesis, OXPHOS, cellular integrity, and apoptosis
[1,2,3,4,5,6]. Proteins encoded by HIV, including Vpr, Nef, Vif,
Vpu, Tat, and Rev, initially impede programmed cell death, allowing
for proliferation of HIV-infected cells, then gradually shift to actively
induce apoptosis of CD4-T cells, macrophages, monocytes, and
microglial cells, thus causing the hallmark global immunodefiency of
AIDS [7]. Systematic mitochondrial dysfunction is also evident
during AIDS progression as mtDNA depletion [8], increased ROS
production [9], antioxidant enzyme deficiency [10], and increased
oxidative damage among patients with accelerated disease [11].

The mitochondrial genome encodes 13 proteins that are vital to
mitochondrial bioenergetics. We found in earlier studies that
mitochondrial DNA genotypes carrying mutations in these genes
are associated with rate of AIDS progression in untreated patients
[12] and the severity of lipoatrophy in patients on highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [13]. Approximately 1,500
additional nuclear-encoded genes have been identified to account
for the remaining protein machinery responsible for mitochondrial
morphology, redox regulation and energetics [14]. Recently, over
1000 nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (NEMPs) were
identified in humans through a comprehensive approach utilizing
both proteomics and bioinformatics [15]. It may be relevant that
4–8% of siRNAs [16,17,18] and 14–40% of proteins [19,20,21]
that have been identified as host factors involved in HIV infection
are also NEMPs, suggesting that NEMPs may be overrepresented
among cellular factors involved with HIV. Here we surveyed
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants within and around
904 known human NEMPs as potential AIDS restriction genes
(ARGs). We genotyped 1455 patients of European descent from
five longitudinal US AIDS cohorts, asking whether SNPs within
NEMP loci are associated with AIDS progression.
Methods
Cohorts
The study group consisted of total of 1455 patients of European
ancestry from five longitudinal cohorts including the Multicenter
AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) [22], the San Francisco City Clinic
Study (SFCC) [23], Hemophilia Growth and Development Study
(HGDS) [24], the Multicenter Hemophilia Cohort Study
(MHCS)[25], and the AIDS Linked to Intravenous Experiences
(ALIVE) cohort (Table S1) [26]. Informed written consent was
obtained from all patients. HIV/AIDS-related genetic studies of
the cohorts has been granted by the NIH Office of Human
Subjects Research under # 4010 (OHSR #4010). Ninety-seven
percent of patients were male. There are two cohorts of subjects
with hemophilia who contracted AIDS principally through
exposure to contaminated blood products between 1978 and
1983: the MHCS is a multi-center longitudinal cohort study
enrolling subjects from 17 American or European treatment
centers beginning in September 1982 and HGDS is a US-based
multicenter cohort of participants from 14 US treatment centers
who became infected between 1982–1983. Sexual transmission in
men who have sex with men is the primary mode of HIV infection
for MACS and SFCC, while intravenous drug use is the principal
mode of transmission in ALIVE.
Quality Control for the Affymetrix 6.0 genotyping array
Subjects. All DNA samples that passed Contrast QC
(CQC.0.4) were genotyped using Affymetrix Power Tools (apt-
probeset-genotype 1.10.0). In addition, 4 controls run a total of 39
times, 145 duplicate samples and 8 CEPH parent-offspring trios
were included. Samples were originally genotyped by batch (200–
500 samples), and individuals with less than 90% call rates were
excluded from further analysis. Duplicates and CEPH controls run
within and between plates were verified for concordance across
runs (average concordance 98.8% for all SNPs across all plates). In
addition, once acceptable genotyping standards were met,
Affymetrix genotypes were compared to previously produced
Taqman, Illumina, and/or Perlegen genotypes at an average of 85
(range: 10–142) sites/sample. Samples with ,90% concordance
with their previous genotypes were discarded. Finally, Affymetrix
gender calls (based on Y chromosome markers, X heterozygosity,
and intensity of the sex chromosome invariant probes) were
compared to clinical data files and inconsistent individuals were
discarded.
Final subject QC was performed in PLINK to determine cryptic
identity and cryptic relatedness and to double-check mistaken
gender calls. Identical subjects (pi-hat .0.9) were investigated and
either discarded (if clinical data did not match), or reduced to a
single genotype file if clinical data, including birth date, matched.
One individual was found who was enrolled in two cohorts.
Related subjects were flagged, but not removed.
Genotyping. All individuals that passed initial QC were re-
clustered together and SNPS were interrogated on the Affymetrix
6.0 genotyping platform. Autosomal SNPs supported by
Affymetrix (871,553 total SNPs) were evaluated for Mendelian
inheritance with 8 CEPH trios, SNP call rates of .95%, and
Hardy Weinburg equilibrium (HWE; p.0.001). A minor allele
frequency cutoff of 0.01 was also imposed. Finally, the 19,951
SNPS that failed HWE were visually assessed to approve, correct,
or exclude genotyping calls based on the quality of the genotyping
clusters. Of these, 2,391 were acceptable, 9,863 were manually
adjusted to correct the calls, and the remaining 7,967 SNPs were
excluded, resulting in a total of 700,022 SNPs approved in
European Americans. None of the significant associations
discussed in this study violated HWE.
NEMP gene coverage Affymetrix 6.0 genotyping array
After subjects and SNP passing QC were re-clustered and
recalled; average call rate was 99.3% with a minimum of 94.04%
[27]. A total of 10,012 successfully genotyped SNPs that were
within 5 kB of 904 NEMP genes (out of 966 NEMP genes found
on chromosomes 1–22) as shown as Table S2.
844 of the NEMP genes were covered by the International
HapMap [28]. Haplotype coverage of the NEMP genes on the
Affymetrix genome scan was determined with Tagger (http://
www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/tagger) evaluation using HapMap
release 21 from the International HapMap Project, and build 35/
UCSC hg17/May 2004 coordinates for genes and tag SNPs [29].
All SNPs that were successfully genotyped on the Affymetrix 6.0
genotyping arrays located within 5 Kb up, and 1 Kb downstream
of the gene were evaluated in order to capture any potential
upstream promoters or linkage surrounding the gene. SNP
coverage was .50% for 679 genes, and 421 of these had coverage
.80% and of these, 257 had coverage .90% (Table S3).
Analyses
All individual follow-up data were censored at time of HAART
availability. AIDS morbidity was defined with the AIDS-1987
Center for Disease Control definition [30] (HIV-1 infection plus
AIDS defining illness). All SNPs were tested as additive, dominant
and recessive genetic models. Tests for association were performed
using both categorical case-control and Cox proportional hazards
models [31]. For survivorship models, only known seroconvertors
(SC) (N = 703 European Americans) were used for analysis.
Seroconversion date was defined as the midpoint between
seronegative and seropositive test results, which had to occur
within 3 years of one another. To improve power and include
valuable information from an additional 444 seroprevalent (SP)
slow progressors in our study, we also performed categorical
analyses between rapid and slow progressors, defined as ,10 years
or . = 10 years before development of clinical AIDS (AIDS-1987
definition). A Fisher’s Exact test was used for dichotomous
categorical analyses with the recessive and dominant genetic
models and a Mantel-Haenszel test statistic was used for the
additive model. Cox proportional hazard models were stratified by
NEMP Genes and AIDS

age at seroconversion (0–20, 20–40 and .40 years) and p-values
were computed with the log-likelihood test statistic.
Genetic association analyses were performed with SAS version 9.1
(SAS Institute, Inc, Cary NC). Two statistical significance levels were
examined. The first (GT) adjusted for the number of genes analyzed
in the study multiplied by the two hypotheses and three genetic
models (pGT; threshold a=0.05/90466 = 9.261026
). This measure
is likely anti-conservative due to multiple SNPs in each gene. The
second correction (ST) adjusted for the total SNPs (10,012) and the six
tests outlined above (pST a =0.05/1001266 = 8.361027
); however
this correction is likely overly conservative since prevalent linkage
disequilibrium between adjacent SNPs means loci are not indepen-
dent. The precise correction likely falls somewhere between these two
measures; therefore we report both p-values to serve as guidelines for
evaluating the association data.
For genetic variations discovered to be associated with
progression to AIDS-1987, sequelae including Kaposi’s sarcoma
(KS) and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) were tested in
dichotomous case-case categorical and survival models. Controls
included AIDS patients who developed an AIDS-1987 sequelae
other than the sequela of interest. Cases were defined both as those
who developed a particular sequela, and as those who developed
that sequela as their first AIDS-1987 defining condition. This
second approach reduces the potential confounding that develop-
ing an initial AIDS defining disease may increase the risk of
developing a second one [32].
Identification and correction for population structure/
stratification among NEMP SNPs
Two most significant eigen vectors based on 50K distantly
spaced autosomal SNPs (excluding mitochondrial, X and Y
chromosome SNPs, and SNPs out of HWE or in linkage
disequilibrium) were calculated for 1455 European American
samples using the Principal Components Analysis module of
Eigensoft software [33]. Upon analysis with CEPH –HapMap
samples and comparison of distribution of European Americans
from this study to that of previously published reports [33,34] we
inferred that these two eigen axes correlated with genetic ancestry
(Figure S1). The distribution of sero-status (SC, SP) and AIDS
outcomes were compared with these recovered significant eigen
axes, and no significant difference between different sero-statuses,
or cases and controls in AIDS outcomes were found.
We further estimated the contribution of individual NEMP
SNPs to the observed population substructure in European
American samples using linear models:
Genotype~b1|eigen1zb2|eigen2
The significance of each slope corresponded to the significance
of the trend observed for a given SNP’s distribution along the
eigen vectors. If a SNP was highly structured and did not indicate
any AIDS outcome association in an unadjusted test result, then
that SNP was excluded from further analyses. If a SNP was highly
structured and indicated a potential AIDS outcome association,
then the eigen vectors were used as covariates in the applied tests.
None of the significant genetic variants discussed in this study
showed significant population substructure. Further, all SNPs
showing significant AIDS outcome results were reanalyzed using
eigen vectors as covariates in the association tests. The eigen
vector adjustments did not make any significant difference on the
association test results. Unadjusted test results are presented
throughout the manuscript.
Results
Associations between NEMPs and AIDS progression
We tested 10,012 SNPs within 904 NEMP genes for association
with progression to AIDS-1987. Successfully genotyped SNPs gave
50% or better haplotype coverage for 679 of known NEMP genes.
SNPs within two NEMP genes displayed significant associations;
Peroxisomal D3,D2-Enoyl-CoA Isomerase (PECI) on chromosome 6
and Acyl-CoA Synthetase Medium-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSM4) on
chromosome 12 (Figures 1 and 2). A Manhattan plot and a QQ-
plot for a dichotomous categorical analysis of AIDS-1987 in the
additive model implies that several SNPs within the gene PECI
were significantly associated with rate of AIDS progression
(Figure 1; Table 1). Linkage disequilibrium between these
SNPs is between D’ = 0.95 for rs584585 and 1 for all others
(Figure 1c). The lowest p-value was in observed for SNP rs629362
(punadjusted = 6.561026
) (Table 1). SNP rs629362 remained signif-
icant when corrected for the number of genes and tests
(pGT = 0.04), however it was no longer significant when alpha
was adjusted for the number of SNPs (pST.0.05, Table 1).
A strong association was also observed for rs7961991 in ACSM4
in survivorship analyses (p = 3.6610-6, Table 1, Figure 1). This
SNP remained significant when the p-value was corrected for the
number of genes and tests (pGT = 0.02), but was no longer
significant when the number of SNPs and tests (pST) were
corrected for (pST = 0.2). A Manhattan plot for time to AIDS-
1987 (recessive genetic model) and the corresponding QQ plot are
shown in figure 2a and 2b respectively. The SNPs in the ACSM4
gene were in complete LD (D’ = 1) as shown in Figure 2c. We see
that only two of the four SNPs in this gene were significant,
suggesting the significant SNPs were likely tracking a yet to be
discovered causal functional SNP in the region of strong LD. All
SNPs with significant associations were in introns, or upstream of
the gene as indicated in Table 1.
Associations between PECI and ASCM4 and
mitochondrial DNA haplogroups
In a previous study, we found that certain mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) haplogroups were associated with AIDS progression
[12]. Because of the phylo-geographic structure of mitochondrial
DNA haplogroups and the potential for epistatis between NEMPs
and the mitochondrial genome, the significant genotypes in PECI
and ASCM4 were checked for epistatic interaction with mitochon-
drial DNA haplogroups with a Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square test.
No associations were observed between PECI SNP rs629362 and
haplogroups H, J, T, U, W, X, or N1I (Table 2). Haplogroup X
was associated with the ASCM4 SNP rs7961991 (p = 0.009);
however, out of 22 individuals in haplogroup X, only one person
had the recessive genotype associated with AIDS progression in
this study, and the adjusted Bonferroni p was .0.05. None of the
SNPs were found to have significant geographic structure.
PECI, ASCM4 and AIDS sequelae
SNPs within PECI, including rs629362 (p = 0.002, HR = 1.8)
and rs626080 (p = 0.00007, HR = 2.2) had a strong association
with KS as shown in Figure 3. No significant results were observed
for KS or PCP with SNPS in ASCM4. Unfortunately, we lacked
sufficient data to look into other less frequent sequelae.
Mitochondrial genes and previously published studies
We further examined NEMPs that were previously reported as
cellular gene products required for HIV-infection in screens using
siRNAs [16,17,18], mRNA expression [21], or proteomics [19,20]
for SNPs associated with AIDS-1987 (Table S4). In our analysis of
NEMP Genes and AIDS
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 September 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 9 | e12862
progression to AIDS, no SNPs within the 151 NEMP genes that
were identified by the HIV infection studies [16,17,18] showed p-
values above the pGT correction threshold; however, fifty-nine
genetic associations from twenty genes produce unadjusted
p#0.01 with the lowest p-value (0.0009) found in the gene for
quinoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR) (rs2535228) for time
to AIDS-1987 (HR = 0.7); six other SNPs in this region showed p-
values from 0.004–0.01 (Table S5). SNPs within three of the gene
fifteen genes replicated in two or more studies were associated with
accelerated progression to AIDS-1987 in the current study: NADH
Dehydrogenase (Ubiquinone) 1 Beta Subcomplex, 7 (NDUFB7), Isocitrate
Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) , and Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 3 (NAD+) Alpha
(IDH3A)] (NDUFB7 rs6511939 HR = 1.6, p = 0.008; IDH1
rs7580715 HR = 2.1, p = 0.009, IDH3A rs11855354, rs8032618
and rs12903696 HR = 1.6, p = 0.007–0.009).
Discussion
We examined 904 genes for nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
proteins for association with the rate of AIDS progression using
genotypes generated by an Affymetrix 6.0 genotyping array of
1455 European American patients from five US AIDS cohorts.
With a Bonferroni adjustment for the number of genes and tests
examined, multiple SNPs within two NEMP genes showed
significant association with AIDS progression: acyl-CoA synthetase
medium-chain family member 4 (ACSM4) on chromosome 12 and
peroxisomal D3,D2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (PECI) on chromosome 6.
Antibodies to PECI have been found in patients with
autoimmune diabetes [35], breast cancer[36], renal cancer [37],
and hepatocarcinoma [38] and PECI serves as an autoantigen
eliciting immune attack against hematopoietic progenitor cells by
both T and B cells in acquired aplastic anemia patients [39]. PECI
is an auxiliary enzyme that catalyzes an isomerization step
required for the beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids
[39,40]. Cellular energy metabolism is largely sustained by
mitochondrial b-oxidation of saturated and unsaturated fatty
acids. A recent study in the THESA cohort suggested that intake
of poly-unsaturated fats was adversely related to liver function in
asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects compared with HIV-unin-
fected subjects [41]. One hypothesis put forth by the THESA
study is that polyunsaturated fats, which are susceptible to attack
by free radicals and oxidation into lipid peroxides, promote liver
damage because of increased oxidative stress in HIV-infected
subjects. This hypothesis will need to be further explored to resolve
if and how the associations observed between SNPs in PECI and
accelerated AIDS progression here may be related.
ACSM4 is a member of a group of synthases that catalyze the
fundamental initial reaction in fatty acid metabolism. This
activation of fatty acids allows their participation in both anabolic
and catabolic pathways [42]. How these functions may relate to

AIDS progression remains to be discovered. As ACSM4
associations are weaker and lack a obvious mechanism, we
consider these associations preliminary.
AIDS’87 is defined by diagnosis of an AIDS sequela, or
‘‘clinical’’ AIDS, therefore most patients are typically past the
earlier CD4 cell count ,200 stage. To look for underlying
associations between PECI and ASCM4 and AIDS-1987 defining
conditions, KS, PCP and opportunistic infections were analyzed
for association with significant SNPs in these two genes. These
data suggest the connection between PECI and AIDS progression
may be through an association to KS.
It should be noted, that although these tests were follow-up to
the genes found significant in progression analyses, if a strict
Bonferoni criteria considering all tests was used, these results
would no longer be significant. We have tried to account for this
matter by using two methods, the first (GT) adjusted for the
number of genes analyzed in the study multiplied by the two
hypotheses and three genetic models, and a second correction (ST)
adjusted for the total SNPs (10,012) and the six tests. The precise
correction likely falls somewhere between these two measures; as
the first is not conservative enough, while the second is likely too
strict. P-values as presented are moderate and conclusions must be
tempered by the multiple comparisons problem. Replication of
these genes in additional cohorts is necessary.We also examined
NEMPs that were previously reported as cellular gene products
required for HIV-infection in screens using siRNAs [16,17,18],
mRNA expression [21], or proteomics [19,20] for SNPs associated
with AIDS-1987. Out of 1353 cellular factors identified in these
studies, 151 are also identified NEMPs. NEMP genes are
significantly overrepresented in Chan et al. 2007, Ryo et al. 2000
and in Ringrose et al. 2008, and a trend is observed in Espeseth
et al. 2008 (Table S3), suggesting a strong link between
mitochondrial function and HIV infection. None of the SNPs
within the 151 NEMP genes that were identified by the HIV
infection studies showed p-values above the pGT correction
threshold; however, fifty-nine genetic associations from twenty
genes produce unadjusted p#0.01, with the strongest significance
found for quinoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR)
(rs2535228). SNPs within three of fifteen genes replicated between
the original studies were associated with accelerated progression to
AIDS-1987 in the current study: NADH Dehydrogenase (Ubiquinone) 1
Beta Subcomplex, 7 (NDUFB7), Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) , and
Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 3 (NAD+) Alpha (IDH3A)]. These associations
may be real or may be statistical artifacts of multiple tests,
therefore they need to be validated in other studies. However, s,
the independent replication of these three HIV factors, plus the
observation of modest SNP associations for these genes with AIDS
progression adds support to a plausible regulatory role of each
NEMP-HIV factor occurs in HIV-related pathogenesis.
Conclusion
Our previous studies on mitochondrial DNA that showed
European haplogroups with presumed functional differences were
associated with AIDS progression and HAART mediated adverse
events [12,13], and the modest influences of nuclear-encoded
mitochondrial genes found in the current study add support to the
idea that mitochondrial function plays a role in AIDS pathogen-
esis.
