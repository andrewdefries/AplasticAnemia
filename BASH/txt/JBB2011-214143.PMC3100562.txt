Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) represents a heterogeneous group of diseases with clonal proliferation, bone marrow failure
and increasing risk of transformation into an acute myeloid leukaemia. Structured guidelines are developed for selective therapy
based on prognostic subgroups, age, and performance status. Although many driving forces of disease phenotype and biology are
described, the complete and possibly interacting pathogenetic pathways still remain unclear. Epigenetic investigations of cancer
and haematologic diseases like MDS give new insights into the pathogenesis of this complex disease. Modiﬁcations of DNA or
histones via methylation or acetylation lead to gene silencing and altered physiology relevant for MDS. First clinical trials give
evidence that patients with MDS could beneﬁt from epigenetic treatment with, for example, DNA methyl transferase inhibitors
(DNMTi) or histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). Nevertheless, many issues of HDACi remain incompletely understood and
pose clinical and translational challenges. In this paper, major aspects of MDS, MDS-associated epigenetics and the potential use
of HDACi are discussed.
1. Introduction
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent a heteroge-
neous spectrum of haematopoietic disorders ranging from
ineffective haematopoiesis with cytopenia to progressive
haematopoiesis with transition to acute myeloid leukaemia
showing morphological and functional abnormalities of
haematopoietic cells [1–3].
Due to diﬃculties in diagnosis and classiﬁcation, epide-
miological analyses report diﬀerent incidence rates [4]. Nev-
ertheless, it has been observed that intensive cancer therapeu-
tic regimes lead to higher incidence rates of secondary forms
of MDS [5]. As reviewed by Corey et al. [6] and Bernas-
coni [7], pathogenetic concepts favoured (i) chromosomal
alterations and (ii) gain- and loss-of-function of proto-
oncogenes and suppressor genes as well as (iii) disturbance
of mitochondrial energy pathway and associated apoptosis.
Although good progress was done to develop well-deﬁned
step-by-step pathogenetic models such as in colorectal cancer
[8–11], the heterogeneous morphological spectrum and
diﬀerent clinical course of MDS remains poorly understood.
Therefore, diﬀerent subgroups of MDS with their char-
acteristic cytogenetic, molecular, and immunological ab-
normalities were deﬁned by international prognostic scoring
systems such as the FAB (French American British) and the
WHO classiﬁcation to help to adequately stratify therapeutic
regimens [1, 3, 12]. As described, the primary goal of
treatment is haematological improvement in cases with
2 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology
low-risk MDS and targeting the underlying disease in cases
with high-risk MDS [13]. Recently, experimental and clinical
investigations revealed that epigenetic processes could play
a key role in MDS and could be innovative targets for
therapeutic approaches [14–18].
We therefore want to give a comprehensive survey of
MDS in the frame of epigenetics with focuses on clinical,
pathogenic, and therapeutic issues.
2. A Survey of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
2.1. A Short Introduction to the Deﬁnition, Classiﬁcation (with
Prognostic Groups), Epidemiology, and Aetiology. According
to the WHO, the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is de-
ﬁned as a heterogeneous disease group with cytopenia due to
ineﬀective haematopoiesis and with dysplastic morphologi-
cal changes in one or more of the myeloid cell lineages and
associated risk to progression into acute myeloid leukaemia
[1–3].
Based on “characteristic” dysplastic features of haemato-
poietic cells (in the bone marrow as well as in the peripheral
blood) [19–21] ﬁve “speciﬁc” subgroups of the MDS were
distinguished [1, 22], which could be more sophistically sub-
classiﬁed by integrating speciﬁc cytogenetic investigations
such as MDS with deletion of chromosome 5q done by the
WHO in 2008 (as reviewed in detail [2, 3, 22]). Established
MDS prognostic groups of low, intermediate I and II as well
as of high risk (like the international prognostic scoring sys-
tem (IPSS)) could identify the individual life risk and could
be helpful for therapeutic decisions implementing blast
count (according to the WHO classiﬁcation), the number of
cytopenias and cytogenetic ﬁndings [12] as well as parameter
of red blood cell transfusion [23]. Interestingly, molecular
alterations that are linked to speciﬁc signalling pathways of
MDS like signalling and diﬀerentiation, cell cycle regulations,
apoptosis, and translation are not integrated into the existing
scoring system until now reﬂecting the morphological and
molecular heterogeneity of this haematological entity [13, 22,
23].
MDS could be observed primarily de novo or after radi-
ation or chemotherapy (especially in patients treated with
alkylating agents or topoisomerase II inhibitors) as so-called
secondary or therapy-associated form of MDS [5, 24–27].
Epidemiological data indicate that especially primary forms
of MDS increase with the age of patients [28]: several authors
reported an overall incidence rate of MDS ranging between
3.5 to 12.6 per 100,000 population per annum [29–31].
Ageing of the population in the Western world [32–34]
and the extensive use of chemo- and radiotherapy for the
treatment of malignant tumours [4, 24, 28, 35] will increase
the incidence of MDS. Therefore, MDS becomes an impor-
tant sociomedical issue, as epidemiological investigations
revealed an age-speciﬁc increase of incidence between the age
group of below 70 and above 70 years from 4.9 to 22.8 [36],
1.6 to 15.0 [30], or 15.0 to 49.0 [31], comparable to our own
investigations [35].
As discussed above, the linkage between chemothera-
py/radiotherapy and therapy-associated MDS is well known.
Yet, knowledge about the aetiology of the large majority
of de novo MDS is not fully conclusive, since some of the
postulated risk factors for MDS (such as hair dyes, alcohol,
and viral disease) showed only a weak or no association
with MDS compared to accepted risk factors like solvents,
cigarette smoking, and radiation [4, 37]. The inheritance of
susceptibility genes is still unclear. Two commonly deleted
segments, 5q31 and 7q22, were identiﬁed by cytogenetic
analysis, which contains tumour-suppressor genes, and are
therefore critical regions to MDS development, which could
be inherited (germline) or induced by antitumour-therapy
(somatic) as reviewed in [38, 39]. Finally, a small percentage
of MDS in adults and in children is associated with genetic
disorders such as Fanconi anaemia, Bloom syndrome,
Diamond-Blackfan syndrome as well as Down syndrome,
Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and neuroﬁbromatosis
[6].
2.2. Pathogenetic Insights. As reviewed in detail by Corey
et al. [6], Bernasconi [7] and Nimer [18] common and
distinct pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of MDS,
which could be summarized by (i) chromosomal/genetic
alterations and molecular defects, (ii) disturbance of the
microenvironment, and (iii) deregulation of apoptosis as
discussed in detail below (see also Figure 1).
2.2.1. The Stem Cell Genetic Defect. Cytogenetic investiga-
tions revealed a broad range of defects which are linked to
speciﬁc biological, clinical, and therapeutic features of MDS
as reviewed in detail elsewhere [7]. Overall, chromosomal
abnormalities could be detected in about 40–60% of primary
and in about 70–90% of secondary forms of MDS ranging
from balanced/unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements to
speciﬁc chromosomal abnormalities such as Del(5q), −7,
Del(7q), +8, Del(20q), −Y, 17p rearrangements, 11q23
translocations as well as complex karyotypes (≥3 defects) [7,
10, 39]. Compared to AML, more deletions and numerical
defects than translocations were observed in MDS, which
go along with nonclonal defects indicating a diﬀerent
pathogenesis in MDS compared to AML [40, 41]. The role
of these chromosomal abnormalities for MDS still remains
unclear, since “typical” class I and II mutations in the
leukemic transformation of AML are missing in MDS [7,
10, 39], normal and abnormal karyotypes are observed side-
by-side in bone marrow of patients with MDS and, ﬁnally,
chromosomal aberrations are found more often in late than
early stages of MDS [42].
Looking on molecular defects in MDS, multiple genes
are aﬀected such as CDKN2B, EVI1, IRF1, NRAS, TP53,
FLT3, and MLL (in decreasing incidence according to [10])
by mutations, deletions, ectopic expression, or promoter
methylation which could inﬂuence the expression of tumour
suppressor genes, if genetic or epigenetic alterations of the
other allele occurred as postulated by Knudson’s hypothesis
[43].
Based on the knowledge that the described genetic defect
in MDS could be both somatic and/or germline-associated
[44–46], the genetic heterogeneity of MDS demand for

cytogenetic analysis in each individual case to evaluate the
risk of heredity and of disease-progression as well as to
develop better therapeutic options [47].
2.2.2. The Role of the Microenvironment. It was shown that
abnormalities of the bone marrow microenvironment play
a role in the pathogenesis of MDS by abnormal expression
levels of cytokines such as interleukin 1β, interleukin 6,
and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α [48, 49]. In detail,
there is evidence that an enhanced TNF-α expression
induced resistance of MDS cells to the proapoptotic eﬀects
of TNF-α leading to proliferation and progression [50].
Additionally, deregulation of proangiogenesis factors (like
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) promotes an
enhanced self-renewal and cytokine elaboration [51]. In
contrast to the ﬁndings on VEGF, the expression of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP) (especially MMP2 and MMP9)
in monocytes correlated with an increased apoptotic rate and
longer overall survival in MDS patients [52].
2.2.3. Apoptosis Deregulation. Deregulation of apoptotic
processes is mainly observed in early stages of MDS,
whereas a deregulation of proliferation is found in advanced
MDS. This is supported by the investigation of apoptosis-
associated markers (ligands and receptors) as reviewed by
Bernasconi [7]. In low-risk MDS, an upregulation of Apo 2.7,
TRAIL, FAS/CD95, p38, TNFR1, CFLARs and Erk1/2 and
downregulation of bcl-2, TNFR2, CFLARL, NF-κB, and AKT
were found, whereas in high-risk MDS a diametric expres-
sion pattern was observed. Apoptosis can be inﬂuenced
diﬀerentially by cytogenetic defects and by cytokine disar-
rangement of the stromal cell compartments. For instance,
MDS associated with aneuplodies (such as three copies of
chromosome 8) presents a signiﬁcantly higher percentage
of apoptotic CD34+ cells. Furthermore, MDS cells with
isolated deletion of chromosome 5q showed a G0/G1 arrest
through the antiproliferative eﬀect of lenalidomide by the
adjustment of growth and diﬀerentiation signals inside the
bone marrow environment [41]. Finally, extrinsic apoptotic
pathways could be deregulated by uncontrolled upregulation
of apoptosis-associated proteins like FAS/CD95, TNFα, or
TRAIL ligands [53].
2.2.4. Molecular Signals for MDS Progression towards AML.
What are the essential molecular signals promoting MDS
towards AML? Experimental ﬁndings investigating apoptotic
deregulation suggest a continuous switch from predominant
proapoptotic to a more proproliferative status of MDS
cells [6, 7]. Transcriptional pathways essentially involved in
this process are the RELA/NFKB1 and the PI3KC2A/AKT1
signal transduction axis [54, 55]. In short, proinﬂammatory
cytokines (such as TNFα, TRAIL, and FAS/CD95) activate
the CHUK/IKBKB complex with consecutive release and
nuclear translocation of RELA and NFKB1 along with
activation of genes being associated with cell growth, diﬀer-
entiation, inﬂammation, and apoptosis [7].
In summary, our knowledge of (i) these speciﬁc molec-
ular abnormalities in the haematopoietic cells in MDS as
well as of (ii) immune deregulation and of (iii) abnormal
bone marrow environment in MDS is sophisticated [8–11]
(see also Figure 1) and could not explain the heterogeneous
4 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology
morphological and clinical presentation of this complex dis-
ease. Additionally, mouse models of MDS currently available
are not suited to reﬂect all of the features of MDS [56–
58]. Taken together, the diﬀerentiation as well as prolifera-
tion/survival is impaired in MDS with potency to progres-
sion to AML due to an unknown second hit event [18].
2.3. Therapeutic Approaches. Standardised therapeutic strat-
iﬁcations were established depending on the prognostic
subgroups and with respect to age and performance status of
the patients (see also Table 1). The therapeutic aims are: (i)
a haematological improvement in low-risk and (ii) altering
natural disease course in high-risk MDS disease subgroups.
Additional information on clinical and molecular features
(as mentioned above) will lead to a tailored, individualised
decision management for therapy in future (see Figure 1).
Until now, internationally approved drugs to treat
patients with MDS are erythropoietin, darbepoeitin, leno-
grastim (G-CSF), 5-azacytidine, decitabine, anti-thymocyte
globulin, cyclosporine, lenalidomide, deferasirox, and defer-
oxamine [13].
In short, the mechanistic aspects of these currently
available treatment options are explained.
(i) In the “best supportive care” setting erythropoietin,
darbepoeitin and lenograstim (G-CSF) act as classical
hematopoietic growth factors stimulating normal
residual hematopoiesis, whereby additional eﬀects
of these drugs such as inducing diﬀerentiation of
dysplastic hematopoiesis via blocking of apoptosis
are discussed [61, 62].
(ii) The chelation therapy with deferasirox and deferox-
amine has the intention to reduce the transfusional
iron overload associated with organ dysfunction due
to chronic anaemia in MDS by mobilization of organ
iron deposit and increased secretion of urinary iron
[63, 64].
(iii) Anti-thymocyte globulin, cyclosporine, and lenalido-
mide have similar immune modulatory proper-
ties interacting with deregulated lymphocytes (such
as CD4/CD8 ratio or T-cell receptor repertoire)
observed in MDS. Additionally, anti-thymocyte glob-
ulin and lenalidomide target changes in bone marrow
microenvironment in MDS through antiangiogenic
and antiproliferative capacities via modifying inte-
grin and chemokine networks. Especially, lenalido-
mide has the property for direct clonal suppression
of myelodysplastic clones with isolated deletion of
chromosome 5q [40, 41, 65, 66].
(iv) The transcriptional modifying therapy contains the
two hypomethylating agents 5-azacytidine and
decitabine. These two drugs are analogues of the
pyramidine nucleoside cytidine and are integrated
into RNA (5-azacytidine) or DNA (both), inducing
progressive loss of methylation by covalently bind-
ing to DNA methyltransferases which are critical
components of the epigenetic network inside normal
and uncontrolled proliferation and diﬀerentiation
[15, 67].
This heterogeneous list of drugs mirrors the diﬀerent
pharmacological approaches according to the stages and
pathomechanisms of MDS. The development of new stan-
dardised guidelines for treatment of MDS as done by the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCC) is there-
fore urgently needed (to view the most recent and complete
version of the guidelines, see also http://www.nccn.org/)
integrating ongoing response ﬁndings of clinical trials (e.g.
based on epigenetic approaches [14, 16, 18, 68]).
2.3.1. Lower Risk MDS. According to the NCCC practical
guidelines for patients with low-risk MDS, a supportive care
for symptomatic anaemia and thrombocytopenia is manda-
tory to additional therapy depending on detectable genetic
abnormalities. In cases of del(5q) and other cytogenetic
abnormalities, treatment with lenalidomide is indicated. In
case of no response and all other remaining cases, the deci-
sion of treatment with azacytidine, decitabine, antithymo-
cytes globulin, cyclosporine, or again lenalidomide depends
on the serum erythropoietin levels (<>500mU/mL) as
described in detail on the NCCC homepage. Additionally, the
iron overload should be reduced by the use of iron chelators
to reduce the risk of cardiac dysfunction.
2.3.2. Higher Risk MDS. According to the NCCC practical
guidelines for patients with high-risk MDS, the intensity of
treatment depends on the performance status of the patient
and eligibility for allogenic haematopoietic stem cell trans-
plantation (HSTT). Since the majority of patients with high-
risk MDS are relatively old (>70 yr), most of these patients
are not possible candidate for high intensity induction
chemotherapy and consecutive allogeneic HSTT and there-
fore receive azacytidine (preferred)/decitabine. The experi-
ence with allogeneic HSTT are disillusioning, since the
response rate of allogeneic HSTT is generally low in com-
parison to de novo AML [69, 70]. Newer decision pathways
for allogeneic HSTT as well as new induction regimes (such
as reduced intensity conditioning) are in development to
improve this high-intensity therapy [13].
Additionally, new therapies with heterogeneous phar-
macological approaches for MDS are currently developed
and investigated in ongoing clinical trials targeting selec-
tive pathways within the pathogenesis of MDS showing
encouraging results and oﬀering durable beneﬁt to patients
with MDS. These new drugs could be sorted according the
targeted mechanism [68, 71, 72]: (i) interaction with survival
signals such as antiangiogenesis, receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitors, protein kinase C inhibitors, matrix metallopro-
tease inhibitors, and farnesyl transferase inhibitors and (ii)
interaction with genetic integrity such as immunoconjugate
and P-glycoprotein antagonists.
Additionally, an alternative, potential, and promising ap-
proach could consist in the application of agents aﬀecting
epigenetic pathomechanisms, including histone deacety-
lase inhibitors (HDACi) such as vorinostat (SAHA), val-
proic acid, entinostat (MS275/SDX275), or panobinostat

(LBH589). This class of agents (as discussed in detail below)
are very interesting in the treatment of MDS, since HDACis
reveal pleiotropic eﬀects on cell cycle, diﬀerentiation, and
apoptosis [73, 74] which are linked and deregulated in MDS.
3. Cancer, Epigenetics, and HDACi
3.1. Cancer and Epigenetic: A Short Overview. Carcinogenesis
is characterised by diﬀerent sequential or parallel genet-
ic/epigenetic hits with a gain- and/or a loss-of-function that
leads to “hallmarks of cancer” such as proliferation, apop-
tosis, tissue remodelling, metastasis, and neoangiogenesis, as
described in detail by Hanahan and Weinberg in an outstand-
ing review [75]. In recent years, the importance of epigenetic
alterations in carcinogenesis processes is emphasised and
lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.
At a glance, epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methy-
lation of cytosine residues inside CpG islands often found
within transcriptional promoter regions in the DNA and var-
ious histone modiﬁcations leading to altered gene expression
[76–78] (see also Figure 2).
3.2. The Role of Histone Modiﬁcations. Basic histone proteins
H2a, H2b, H3, and H4 build an octamer, called nucleosome
packing the DNA by coiling into the nucleus [79]. These
histone complexes are posttranslationally modiﬁed by dif-
ferent levels of methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation,
or ubiquitinylation in order to coordinate the regulation
of gene transcription—a process referred to as “histone
coding” [80]. These acyl modiﬁcations of histone proteins
are exerted by two groups of highly conserved enzymes called
histone acetyl transferases (HAT) and histone deacetylases
(HDAC). HAT transfer acetyl groups to ε-amino groups
of lysine residues in all four histone proteins leading to
an “open” conformation of chromatin allowing subsequent
binding of transcription factors, whereas the typical result of
deacetylation by HDACs is condensed chromatin associated
with transcriptional repression [81]. Interestingly, only 2 to
10 percent of all genes are regulated by this mechanism as
demonstrated using gene arrays emphasizing the role of this
“histone code” [74, 82, 83]. However, this data displayed
the change in global gene expression, and these studies did
not investigate single histone acetylation status or functional
analysis of histone deacetylation.
Until now more than 30 diﬀerent HATs have been de-
scribed and have been divided into two main classes with
diﬀerent cellular distribution. Whereas A-type HATs are
found in the nucleus and have a transcriptional role, B-type
HATs are located in the cytoplasma [84, 85]. On the other
side, at least 18 diﬀerent HDACs have been published and are
categorised into four major groups based on their sequence
homology to their respective yeast HDACs [73, 86]: Class I—
HDACs (Rpd3-like) with the zinc-dependent isotypes HDAC
1, 2, 3, and 8 are located in the nucleus and act as tran-
scriptional corepressors. Class II—HDACs (Had1-like) with
HDAC 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 are located in nucleus and cyto-
plasma and show also a transcriptional corepressor function
but also mediate a variety of cytoplasmic nonhistone protein
modiﬁcations [87]. Class III—HDACs (sirtuins) with SIRT1
to 7 are associated with regulation of cell proliferation and
cell cycle control. Additionally, HDAC11 represents a sepa-
rate class (class IV) of HDACs, since HDAC11 is structurally
related to both, class I and II HDACs [88].
This subtype of epigenetic mechanisms of histone modi-
ﬁcation is centrally involved in the regulation of diﬀerentia-
tion, proliferation, and tissue maintenance during embryo-
genesis [89, 90]. In contrast, deregulated epigenetic action
of HDACs is observed in various types of human tumours

such as gastric (HDAC1), breast (HDAC1, HDAC6), or colon
carcinoma (HDAC3) [91–94]. Additionally, histone modi-
ﬁcations are essentially involved in haematological diseases
such as leukaemias as reviewed by Issa [16]. For that reason,
the inhibition of HDACs generally seems to be a promising
and novel approach in the treatment of human cancer.
3.3. Molecular Classes and Mechanisms of HDACi. Many
chemical substances have been developed to inhibit HDACs
in vitro and in vivo which could be divided in hydroxamic
acid derivates, cyclic tretapeptides, benzamides, and short-
chain fatty acids as listed in Table 2. Some of them are tested
in clinical trials [81, 95], whereas until now only superoylan-
ilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) has received approval by the
FDA for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [96].
In general, the eﬀects of such HDACi are pleiotropic
with induction of diﬀerentiation, growth arrest, and/or
apoptosis of tumour cells [97, 98]. To evaluate the possible
role of HDACi in MDS, it is necessary to look into the
molecular mechanism of HDAC inhibition. Although the
exact mechanisms of anticancer eﬀect by HDACi are under
debate, HDACi have both speciﬁc and unspeciﬁc eﬀects
[74, 81, 99]. With the exception of HDAC6 inhibitors, all
HDACi induce a G1/S-phase cell cycle arrest associated with
an increased expression of the endogenous cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor p21cip1/waf1 [100, 101]. This action can be
both p53-dependent and -independent as shown by our own
experiments [102, 103]. For all other eﬀects observed for
HDACi such as upregulation of the death receptor pathway
(extrinsic (TRAIL-mediated) and intrinsic (mitochondrial-
related)), induction of reactive oxygen species, and alteration
of chaperone function (part of the cellular stress response) or
NF-κB pathway (modulator of the inﬂammatory pathway),
it is diﬃcult to deﬁne if the eﬀects of HDACi are directly
triggered by transcriptional regulation that is mediated by
hyperacetylation [87, 104]. Newer investigations revealed
that acetylation and deacetylation represent an ubiquitous
regulation mechanism for cellular networking such as RNA
splicing, DNA damage repair, cell cycle control, nuclear
transport, actin remodelling, ribosome, and chaperone func-
tion that is summarised as “acetylome” [105–108]. Addi-

with heterogenous and diﬀerent eﬀect on ubiquitination
[109], so that it is impossible to deﬁne a general mode of
action for HDACi [87].
3.4. Clinical Application and Experience of HDACi. The ma-
jority of chemically designed HDACi is under intensive clin-
ical investigation for treatment of haematological diseases
such as acute or chronic leukaemias, lymphomas, and MDS
[110, 111]. Currently, only the pan-deacetylase inhibitor
SAHA has been approved by the FDA for treatment of cuta-
neous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) [96]. Until now, the overall
response reached up to 30%, but long-term surveillance is
still missing. From a pharmacokinetic view most of HDACi
used in clinical phase I studies have short half-life in plasma
(2–8 hrs, except for MS-275 with 80 h [112]), followed by
hepatic metabolism and intestinal excretion [113–118]. The
major adverse toxicities of HDACi include fatigue, som-
nolence, confusion, diarrhoea, myelosuppression, and QT
prolongation, thus limiting therapeutic applications [113–
118]. Additionally, two questions regarding the use of HDACi
are still unanswered. (i) It is currently unclear whether
more speciﬁc HDAC class I & II inhibitors (like MS-275) or
pan-deacetylase inhibitors (like SAHA or panobinostat) are
more eﬃcient in tumour reduction. (ii) Furthermore, is the
acetylation of histone H3 in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells a tool for biomarker HDAC inhibitor eﬃciency [113]?
Various studies could not conﬁrm a correlation of peripheral
H3 acetylation and tumour treatment responses [110, 111].
Acetylation of peripheral H3 as well as expression of p21
in peripheral blood cells have been considered as potential
biomarkers but were shown to possess only a poor corre-
lation with the cognate expression pattern inside a (solid)
tumour and with the overall response to the treatment.
Additionally, an assay of HDAC enzymatic activity in intact
cells on the basis of a cell-permeate substrate with ﬂuorescent
read-out was evaluated in two phase I trials, whereby the
reliability of this test is not clear [116, 119]. For that,
adequate biomarkers for monitoring tumour target eﬀects of
HDACi are still missing.
4. MDS, Epigenetics, and HDACi
It is still under debate how much epigenetics inﬂuences
initiation and the clinical course of MDS. As mentioned
above, experimental data suggest that especially DNA methy-
lation plays an important role in the disrupted haematopoei-
sis [16]. In the progression of MDS, associated tumour
suppressor genes are increasingly methylated, leading to
resistance to classical cytotoxic chemotherapy [67]. For
instance, methylation frequency of the tumour suppressor
genes p15, CDH-1, DAP-Kinases, and SOCS-1 was detected
in 89%, 48%, 28%, and 62% of patients with MDS, chronic
myelomonocytic leukaemia, and high-risk AML, respectively
[120]. Additionally, a genomics-based methylation assay of
CD34+ cells of normal control patients and patients with
MDS or AML revealed that more than 700 unique genes
in CD34+ cells of MDS patients showed hypermethylation
compared to normal controls [121, 122]. Recently, mutations
of polycomb-associated gene ASXL1 which regulates histone
modiﬁcations is described in MDS and chronic myelomono-
cytic leukaemia [123]. Nevertheless, “hard” data on the
acetylation status in MDS are missing or are particularly
published in circumstance of clinical trials of HDACi or
in combination with DNA methyl transferase inhibitors
(DNMTi), described below in detail.
4.1. Clinical Trials Phase I/II. In 2001, the HDAC inhibitor
valproic acid (VA) in combination with all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA) was shown to induce diﬀerentiation in malignant

myeloid cells [124, 125] inducing the setup of diﬀerent pilot
studies of heterogeneous combination of these two drugs
[17]. The response rate within these clinical trials reﬂects the
morphological subtypes of MDS with overall response rates
of 8%, 11%, 22%, and 50% in the line with MDS subgroups
ranging from IPSS low-risk, intermediate-I, intermediate-
II, to high-risk MDS, respectively. Interestingly, most of
the responses were observed in the group with low-risk
karyotypes [126].
In subsequent years, several clinical trials with other
HDACi were started for therapy of MDS (as listed in
Table 3). Most of these clinical trials with HDACi are in
phase I indicating the preliminary experience with these
drugs in MDS. Speciﬁc or pan-HDACi were phenylbutyrate
(partially in combination all-trans retinoic acid), depsipep-
tide (romidepsin), LBH589 (panobinostat), SAHA (Vorino-
stat), and MS275/SDX275 (entinostat) in descending order
according to the frequency of use. As these trials were
conducted in a Phase I setting, the overall patient number
is low and the primary endpoints were toxicity and safety;
response rates, ranging from 9 to 57%, were only secondary
endpoints here.
An interesting aspect is the type of “biomarkers” which
are used during these trials to describe the eﬀects of HDACi
on deacetylation [15, 17]: in the trials with valproic acid in
combination with ATRA, the acetylation status of histone H3
and H4 in blood mononuclear cells as well as of the HDAC
protein were determined. While missing other possibilities
of suﬃciently monitoring the bioactivity of HDACi, clinical
eﬀects such as transfusion requirements, white blood cell
count, or percentage of immature cells (in the peripheral
blood or bone marrow) were additionally used.
In summary, single agent clinical trials of HDACi have
shown a good safety proﬁle in patients with MDS, although
the response rates observed so far are lower than for DNMT
inhibitors, which is attributable to the predominant Phase I
trial design conducted so far.
Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology 9
4.2. Combination Therapy. Experimental data could demon-
strate that DNA methylation interacts with histone deacety-
lase activity indicating the recursive complexity of epige-
netics [135, 136]. Therefore, it was expected that HDACi
and DNMTi would show synergistic eﬀects [67, 137]. This
synergistic eﬀects could be explained by the known crosstalk
between DNA methylation and histone modiﬁcations: (i)
HDACs are activated by DNMT and by methylcytosine-
binding proteins potentiating the gene silencing eﬀect
[76, 138], (ii) hypermethylated genes are resistant to re-
expression by treatment with HDACis [139], and addition-
ally (iii) DNMTi increases histone methylation and acetyla-
tion (such as H3K4) thus activating gene transcription [140].
Nevertheless, more detailed mechanisms of the synergistic
eﬀects of HDACi and DNMTi remain to be investigated.
Our own experience with the DNMTi Zebularine and SAHA
conﬁrmed the synergy on apoptosis, proliferation inhibition,
and diﬀerentiation in a pancreatic cancer model [141].
Therefore, analysis of sequential application of DNMTi and
HDACi were performed in vitro and in vivo identifying
that primary application of demethylating agent (low dose)
following by an HDAC inhibitor show the best re-expression
levels of hypermethylated genes [137, 142], which is in line
with the concept of DNA methylation via the so-called
de novo DNA methyltransferases during DNA replication
[103].
Interestingly, combination therapy of MDS using DNMTi
and HDACi is already ongoing (as listed in Table 4) using the
combination of decitabine or azazytidine as DNMTi and VA
(in one study in combination with ATRA) or phenylbutyrate
as HDACi. The overall response rates are optimistic up to
54%, whereas complete response was observed in up to
22%. Nevertheless, the patient numbers of these clinical trials
are small due to the Phase I/II setting and are therefore
not powered for determining response rates. No unexpected
toxicity proﬁles were seen. Speciﬁc details of these studies
were in detail: the study of Gore et al. showed that reversed
methylation during the ﬁrst cycle of therapy correlates with
therapy response. Interestingly, this was more often accom-
panied by induction of acetylation of histone H3 and H4
following administration of the DNMTi rather than of the
HDACi [143]. Such convincing data could not be obtained
using the HDAC inhibitor VA. In the study of Garcia-Manero
et al., global methylation and p15 promotor methylation did
not diﬀer between responders and nonresponders. Looking
at HDACi eﬀects, histone acetylation did not increase until
application of highest dose level of VA, whereas the HDACi
target p21WAF1/CIP1
increased during therapy [144]. Clinical
beneﬁt was observed in the trial of Blum et al. independently
of whether with or without VA, conﬁrming that this agent is
not a potent HDACi [145]. Finally, the data of the study of
Soriano et al. corroborated the ﬁndings of the other studies
with VA that global mutation as well as induction of p21
and p14 mRNA did not correlate with therapy response
[146].
In summary, the combination of HDACi with DNMTi
as well as other combinations (including diﬀerent cytotox-
ics, targeted therapies and radiation therapy as reviewed
from Batty et al. [14]) still remains an interesting ﬁeld for
experimental investigations as well as for larger randomised
trials based on available preclinical data in order to detect the
best synergy of these agents.
5. Conclusion and Outlook
The heterogeneous nature of MDS demands diﬀerential
therapy strategies, which reﬂects on the one hand prognostic
subgroups, age, and performance status of the patients with
MDS and on the other hand the associated pathogenesis
pathways (see Figure 1 and Table 1). Until now, detailed
insights into the pathogenesis of MDS have not been
published. Yet, the factors driving progression as well their
mechanism of interaction are still unclear. New insights came
from the ﬁeld of epigenetics, which admittedly leads to more
complexity, too. First clinical trials give evidence that patients
with MDS could beneﬁt from epigenetic treatment with
DNA methylation inhibitors and HDACi [14]. Nevertheless,
many issues of HDACi remains completely unknown and
pose clinical and translational challenges [74].
(i) As HDACi have been approved in the treatment of
CTCL by the FDA, the mechanism of their selectivity
is speculative postulating preferential induction of
apoptosis in vitro [148], expression of HDAC2 in
aggressive CTCL [149] as well as modulation of gene
expression in vivo [150]. For that, further detailed
molecular investigations of HDACi treated CTCL are
urgently needed to better understand the molecular
mechanisms of the reported excellent clinical results
in CTCL and to confer these ﬁndings to other
tumorous diseases like MDS.
(ii) As histone H3 and H4 acetylation are not correlated
with clinical response [110, 111], surrogate markers
have to be identiﬁed for therapy prognosis, control-
ling and terminating related to the patient and MDS-
related disease stage.
(iii) An additional task is to clarify speciﬁc pharmaco-
logical aspects of HDACi such as potency, isotype
selectivity, application, and toxicity proﬁle as well
as mechanisms of resistance. These ﬁndings could
support the decision on which HDACi are suitable for
which MDS subgroups [151–154].
(iv) Finally, the sequential application strategy of HDACi
with DNMTi or other cytotoxic drugs should be
determined to optimize the additive or synergistic
eﬀects in the treatment of MDS [14].
For that, we are at the beginning of establishing a HDAC-
inhibitor strategy in the complexity of therapeutic manage-
ment of MDS.
