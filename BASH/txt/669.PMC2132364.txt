LOUPING ILL IN MAN
BY THOMAS M. RIVERS, M.D., ~ FRANCIS F. SCHWENTKER, M.D.
(From the Hospital of The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research)
(Received for publication, Febnmry 1, 1934)
The fact that the etiological agent of louping ill (1, 2), a natural
disease of sheep in Scotland and the northern part of England, is a
filterable virus (3) capable of producing in monkeys (4) and mice (5) a
disease somewhat similar to poliomyelitis induced us to procure some
of the virus for investigation (6). It was supplied to another labora-
tory of the Institute in which three of the workers, one after another,
became sick. Inquiry disclosed the fact that an English investigator
had also become ill after having worked with the virus. A prelimi-
nary note (7) has already been made regarding these cases. In the
present paper a detailed description of the cases and a report of the
results of the investigations undertaken to ascertain whether the virus
of louping ill was the etiological agent involved are presented.
Reportof Cases
Case/.--Dr. F., male, 28, became sick on Dec. 2, 1932, twelve weeks after the
initiation of his work with louping ill virus. For 5 days he experienced general
malaise, headache, and a temperature ranging between 101° and 101.5°F. Fol-
lowing this bout of fever the patient was afebrile for 8 days during which time
he worked in spite of the fact that he did not feel as well as usual. On Dec. 15,
he returned to bed because of a transient diplopia and a temperature of 102°F.
From Dec. 15 until Dec. 18, the date of admission to the Hospital, the patient
had a headache, fever, and recurring attacks of diplopia, and, in spite of drowsi-
ness, was unable to sleep. On Dec. 17 he experienced several attacks of projectile
vomiting which were unaccompanied by nausea.
Upon admission to the Hospital of The Rockefeller Institute the patient had a
temperature of 102.1°F. and a pulse rate of 84. He was drowsy and had a head-
ache. The general physical examination was negative with the exception of a
marked diminution in the intensity of the deep reflexes and a diplopia caused by
a weakness of the internal rectus muscle of the left eye. During the examination
it was noticed that the patient's respirations were irregular and accompanied by
sighs. There were 10,500 white blood cells per c.rnm, of which 83 per cent were
granulocytes. On Dec. 19, the day after admission to the Hospital, the patient
669
670 LOUPING ILL IN MAN
continued to have attacks of vomiting but at this time they were accompanied
by nausea. No other significant changes were noticed in the patient's general
condition. Spinal fluid was obtained for study. It was dear, but contained an
increased amount of globulin and 61 white cells per c.mm. of which 88 per cent
were mononuclear elements. Cultures of the blood and spinal fluid remained
sterile. Mice injected intracerebrally with blood and with spinal fluid remained
well. On Dec. 20, the patient received intravenously 50 cc. of a 50 per cent
solution of glucose. Two similar intravenous injections were made the next day.

improved; his headache was less severe, the nausea and vomiting ceased, he
became jovial and regained the ability to sleep normally. A second specimen
of blood was taken on Dec. 22; cultures remained sterile and mice inoculated
intracerebrally with small amounts of it remained well. Spinal fluid obtained
on the 23rd of December contained blood. That obtained on the 30th had a
few blood cells, 26 leucocytes per c.mm., and an increased amount of globulin.
The diplopia disappeared on the 22nd. The temperature returned to a normal
level on the 23rd. Following this the patient made a rapid recovery since which
time he has remained well. See Chart 1 for a summary of the ease. At the time
the patient was in the Hospital the physicians who saw him believed that he
had epidemic encephalitis.

When Dr. F. became sick Mrs. C. carried on the work with louping
ill virus until she (Case 2) became sick, Jan. 31, 1933, approximately 6
weeks after she began handling the infectious agent.
Case 2.--Mrs. C., 27, on Jan. 31 went to bed at home because of fever, head-
ache, backache, and prostration. Nothing of significance except a reddened
throat was observed by her husband who is a physician. The patient's con-
dition remained unchanged until Feb. 5 when her temperature reached normal.
During this period of her illness a marked leucopenia, 2000-4000 cells per c.mm.,
existed (Chart 2). She gradually improved and returned to work on Feb. 14
at which time the white blood cell count was 6400. On Feb. 18 the headache
returned and increased in intensity until the 21st when it became very severe.
In spite of the discomfort Mrs. C. continued to work until the afternoon of the
21st when she was carried home prostrated with fever, slight photophobia, and
intense headache. On Feb. 22 the white blood cells numbered 12,000 per c.mm.
of which 82 per cent were granulocytes. A blood culture taken at this time re-
mained sterile. The fever continued and was accompanied by a slightly confused
mental state. On Feb. 23 the patient was admitted to the White Plains Hospital, 1
White Plains, N. Y.
On admission to the Hospital the patient's temperature was 104°F. and the
pulse rate was 90. She complained of headache, stiffness of the neck, sore throat,
and nausea. Examination revealed that the patient was drowsy and had a stiff
neck and an inflamed throat. Feb. 24, she was still nauseated and complained
of transient blurring of vision. The white blood cell count was 17,350. Feb. 25,
headache, nausea, and vomiting persisted. A consultant was called who, in view
of the symptoms, the stiffness of the neck, and the blurring of the optic discs,
made a diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis. A lumbar puncture was made.
The spinal fluid was clear, reduced Fehling's solution, contained, in addition to
an increased amount of globulin, 45 white cells per c.mm. No tubercle bacilli
were found in the spinal fluid; cultures remained sterile; mice injected intra-
cerebrally with small amounts of the fluid remained well. The patient's general
condition improved rapidly, and, on Feb. 28, her temperature reached a normal
level. Although her general condition improved, a definite retrobulbar neuritis
developed. Mar. 3, spinal fluid was again obtained for examination. It was
slightly blood-tinged; sugar was present; globulin was increased; leucocytes were
50 per c.mm. of which 60 per cent were mononuclear elements; cultures remained
sterile. The patient continued to improve and the optic neuritis gradually sub-
sided. Mar. 23, the patient was discharged from the Hospital. After a period
of convalescence at home she returned to work and since that time has remained
well. Chart 2 summarizes the essential features of the case. In view of the
Mrs. C. was on Dr. W. W. Mott's service and it was through his courtesy and
cooperation that we were able to obtain data regarding her illness.

fact that the patient made a speedy recovery the diagnosis of tuberculous menin-
gitis was changed to acute encephalitis.
When Mrs. C. became sick on Jan. 31, Dr. W. took charge of the
work on louping ill. He (Case 3) became ill on Feb. 8.
Case 3.--Dr. W., male, 39, on Feb. 8, after strenuous exercise followed by ex-
posure to inclement weather experienced chilly sensations, dizziness, and ele-
vation of temperature. Feb. 9, he worked in spite of dizziness, anorexia, and a
temperature of 101°F. Feb. 10 to 17, he remained in bed because of headache,
photophobia, and fever--temperature ranged between 101° and 103°F. Feb. 17
to 20, convalesced at home; headache and weakness persisted. Feb. 20 to Mar. 1,
the patient was able to be at the laboratory but was weak and unable to use his
eyes for close work. Mar. 1, the patient felt fully recovered and has remained
well since that time. The physician in charge of the case made a diagnosis of
influenza.
Upon inquiry it was found that an English investigator (Case 4)
at the Lister Institute had an attack of encephalitis in 1932 after
having worked with louping ill virus. Through the courtesy of Dr.
Critchley, 137 Harley Street, London, we have been able to secure the
data regarding this patient. The patient himself was in the United
States during 1933, a year after recovery from his illness, and we were
able to obtain a specimen of serum from him at that time for neutrali-
zation tests which will be described later in the paper.
Case 4.--Dr. H., male, 31, from May 10 to 14, experienced headache, soreness
in throat, malaise, and muscular stiffness. He worked on May 14 in spite of a
headache and a slight elevation of temperature, 100°F. From the 14th until the
19th the patient remained at home because of intense headache, drowsiness,
nausea, vomiting, and fever--temperature ranged between 100° and 104.5°F.
The pulse was slow. On the 17th the white blood cells numbered 16,000 per
c.mm. of which 80 per cent were granulocytes.
In view of the patient's condition he was admitted to King's College Hospital,
May 19. Upon admission his temperature was 103.4°F., pulse 64, respirations 20.
He was drowsy and had a severe headache; speech was slow; neck was stiff; deep
reflexes were diminished in intensity; abdominal reflexes were not obtained. The
spinal fluid was under increased pressure and contained sugar, 667 nag. of chlorides
per 100 cc., 110 rag. of protein per 100 cc., an increased amount of globulin, 32
red blood ceils per c.mm., and 468 leucocytes per c.mm. of which 77 per cent were
mononuclear elements. Cultures and smears of the fluid revealed no micro-
organisms. On May 20, 21, and 22, lumbar punctures were made (Chart 3), and
the spinal fluid was found to be of the same general nature as that already de-

scribed. The presence of blood cells should be noted, inasmuch as it was believed
not to be due to the trauma of the puncture. In fact, several specimens of the
fluid were brownish in color. May 20, the patient's general condition was im-
proved; his fever was not as high as it had been; the tendon and abdominal re-
flexes were absent; the optic discs showed decided pallor. May 21, the patient's
temperature reached the normal level and remained there. He felt better, was
rational, and took a small amount of solid food. A marked tremor of the face,
eyes, tongue, and hands was noticed. This persisted for several days and gradu-
ally disappeared. Tendon and abdominal reflexes were still not obtained. May
25, patient was entirely free from headache, was very alert, and wanted to get up.
May 26, deep reflexes were still absent, but the abdominal reflexes had returned.
The patient continued to improve, but on June 3 he developed a definite weakness
of the muscles of the upper and lower parts of the left side of the face and some
difficulty was experienced in blinking the left eyelid. Nothing else abnormal
was noted. In fact, all the reflexes had returned to a normal state of activity.
A lumbar puncture made at this time revealed a clear colorless fluid which con-
tained sugar, 718 rag. of chlorides per 100 cc., 320 mg. of protein per 100 cc., an
increased amount of globulin, no red blood cells, and 55 leucocytes per c.mm.
of which 97 per cent were mononuclear cells. Cultures and smears of the fluid
showed no bacteria. From June 3 until the time of discharge from the Hospital,
June 18, the patient improved rapidly; the facial weakness gradually decreased
and finally disappeared during convalescence at home. Since this illness the
patient has been well. See Chart 3 for a summary of the significant features of
the case. At first it was thought that the patient had tuberculous meningitis,
but, in view of his rapid recovery, a final diagnosis of acute encephalitis was made.
EXPERIMENTAL
There is no record in the literature of the occurrence of louping ill in
man, yet the disease was considered in connection with the cases we
have reported, and attempts to demonstrate the virus in the blood and
spinal fluid of two of them were made without success. Failure to
demonstrate the virus under such conditions, however, was not con-
sidered proof that the patients had not had louping ill, because it is not
always possible to demonstrate the virus in the blood and spinal fluid
of monkeys known to have the disease. Consequently, inasmuch as
we had developed a test (6) for the presence of neutralizhug or pro-
tective antibodies in the sera of monkeys immune to louping ill, we
decided to apply the test to the sera of the four individuals who were
suspected of having had the disease. In addition to these sera, we
also tested the sera of other people working with the virus, as well as
the sera of a number of individuals who had had no known contact
676 LOUPING ILL IN MAN
with the active agent. The manner in which the tests were conducted
will be described. Then, several of them will be presented in the form
of tames. Finally, a summary of the results will be presented.
Method of Conducting the Neutralization Tests
The virus emulsions used in the neutralization experiments were prepared from
pooled brains of mice killed at the height of a louping ill infection. After removal
from the animals, the brains were stored for 24 hours in separate containers in an
ice box while bits of each were tested by means of cultures for the presence of
ordinary bacteria. The brains free from bacteria were pooled and ground in a
mortar. Sufficient Locke's solution was then added to make a 20 per cent emul-
sion which was centrifuged at 2000-3000 R.1,.~. for 10 minutes. Then decimal
dilutions of the supernatant fluid were made with Locke's solution. Portions of
each dilution were mixed with an equal amount of the serum the neutralizing
properties of which were being investigated. The mixtures were allowed tostand
for 2 hours at room temperature and then for 1 hour in a refrigerator at 0°C.
0.03 cc. of each of the mixtures were then injected intracerebmlly, respectively,
into each of six mice. The animals were observed for 18 days, and the number of
deaths and the day of death of each animal were recorded. No mouse that suc-
cumbed sooner than the 4th day after injection was considered to have died of
louping ill.
In each test at least two control sera were used. These consisted of a serum
(negative control) that did not neutralize the virus and of a neutralizing serum
(positive control) either from an immune monkey or from an immune person. It
must be remembered that one cannot use virus emulsions diluted with Locke's
solution alone as negative controls, because it has been shown (6) that in emulsions
diluted in such a manner the virus of louping ill deteriorates rapidly. The Rocke-
feller Institute strain of albino mice was employed in approximately one-third of
the experiments, while the Swiss strain of albino mice was used in the others.
The latter mice are very susceptible to the virus and are highly suitable for this
type of work. The former are not 100 per cent susceptible to the active agent,
yet they proved satisfactory for the tests even though the results obtained with
them were not so striking as were those when Swiss mice were used.
Results of Neutralization Tests
In the manner described above 17 tests were conducted in which
sera from 63 individuals were examined for the presence of neutralizing
antibodies for louping ill virus. In Table I, Test 2 is summarized,
and from the results presented it is obvious that the sera from Indi-
viduals 1 and 8 are comparable to that of the negative control, In-
dividual 19, while the sera from Individuals 5 and 6 are comparable

to that of the monkey immune to louping ill. Table II summarizes
Test 17 and reveals (1) that the sera of Individuals 7, 17, and 45 are
comparable to that of the negative control, Individual 43; (2) that the
sera of Individuals 2 and 6 are comparable to that of the monkey im-
mune to louping ill; (3) that the serum of Individual 38 possesses less
neutralizing antibodies than do the other positive sera.
In Table IIIa summary of all the neutralization tests is presented.
The sera for this work were collected from both sexes and from indi-
viduals 1 year to 68 years old. The majority of the people, however,
were in the neighborhood of 35 years of age. A number of the sera
were tested more than once and more than one specimen of serum was
collected from six of the individuals. The sera from the different
individuals were given numbers which have been arranged in the
table according to whether the persons from whom the sera were
collected had had close contact (Nos. 1-7), possible contact (Nos. 8-17),
or no history of contact (Nos. 18-63) with the virus of louping ill.
In addition to this arrangement, the nationality of the individuals, the
diseases from which they were suffering or from which they had re-
cently recovered are indicated. Finally the results--percentage of
deaths of mice used--of the neutralization tests and our interpretation
of them are given.

An examination of Table III reveals the following facts: No evi-
dence was obtained to indicate that nationality and race determine the
presence or absence of neutralizing properties of serum for louping ill
virus. The sera of individuals sick of or recovered from nephritis,
hypertension, arteriosclerosis, syphilis, carcinoma of the stomach,
rheumatic heart disease, rheumatic fever, aplastic anemia, pneumonia,
measles, pertussis, varicella, vaccinia, pseudobulbar palsy, epidemic
encephalitis, postinfection encephalitis, benign lymphocytic meningitis,
do not neutralize the virus of louping ill. Although the age and sex
of the persons from whom the sera were collected are not shown in the
table, it can be stated that these factors have no apparent effect upon
the presence or absence of significant neutralizing antibodies against
the active agent. The striking fact obtained from a study of the
results in the table is that close contact of individuals with the virus
is in some manner associated with the appearance in their sera of neu-
tralizing properties. For instance, of seven people who had been in
close contact with the active agent, five possess neutralizing sera.
Of these five, three (Cases 1, 2, 4) had had encephalitis, one (Case 3)
had been sick with an influenza-like disease, and one had not been
consciously ill while working with the virus. Of ten individuals who
might have had contact with the active agent but who had not worked
with it, none possesses a neutralizing serum. Of 46 people who gave
no history of contact with the virus, only one, No. 38, possesses a serum
with neutralizing antibodies and these upon repeated tests were found
to be less active or less abundant than were those of the other positive
sera. There is no obvious explanation of why this serum should have
been positive.
DISCUSSION
Several interesting features of the cases presented in the first part
of the paper deserve comment. It should be noted (Charts 1, 2, 3)
that all of the patients had a pulse-temperature disproportion and that
a small amount of blood was present in a number of the specimens of
spinal fluid which the operators believed was not due to the trauma of
the needle. One patient was thought to have had epidemic encephal-
itis, two were considered to have had tuberculous meningitis. Since all
of them recovered promptly and completely it is unlikely that these
684 LOUPING ILL IN MAN
diagnoses were correct. All of the physicians who examined the
patients, however, agree that the individuals had an encephalitis.
Two (Cases l, 2) of the four patients had an influenza-like disease
followed by a short period of fair health before the onset of symptoms
and signs of encephalitis. A third patient (Case 4) was sick for 4
days, although he continued to work, before the onset of the severe
symptoms of encephalitis. The fourth patient (Case 3) had what
seemed to be nothing more than a severe attack of influenza. It has
been stated (8) that louping ill virus may at times produce in sheep an
infection without much apparent involvement of the central nervous
system. Consequently, one wonders whether the primary illness in
three (Cases 1, 2, 4) of the patients and the illness of the fourth (Case 3)
represent systemic infections which in three instances were followed
by involvementof the central nervous system. In sheep and monkeys,
ataxia due to involvement of the cerebellum is a prominent feature of
louping ill. The cases presented in this paper evidenced no signs of
ataxia. This fact, however, does not preclude the possibility that they
represent instances of the disease in man.
The question of whether the attacks of disease in man described by
us represent instances of infection with louping ill virus now arises.
In fact, one might suggest that they represent cases of encephalitis
similar to those that occurred in St. Louis during the summer of 1933.
This is not true, however, because sera from our cases, which neutralize
the virus of louping ill, do not neutralize the St. Louis virus (9).
Unfortunately, a definite answer to the question raised cannot be
given, because louping ill virus was not recovered from any of our
cases. Nevertheless, the circumstances under which they occurred
and the results of the neutralization tests make it likely that they
represent such an infection. If the cases represent Iouping ill infec-
tions in man, the frequency with which they occurred in one labora-
tory was probably due to the fact that the intranasal instillations of
the virus in large numbers of mice, practiced in that laboratory, led to
the exposure of the workers to large doses of the virus suspended in the
air in droplets of moisture.
The situation described by us is somewhat unique, because louping
ill virus has been in America for only a short period of time, and, so far
as is known, is to be found in only four laboratories. Therefore, the
T. M. RIVERS AND F. F. SCHWENTKER 685
facts obtained by means of our neutralization tests may be of signifi-
cance in relation to certain general phenomena of immunity and for
this reason may be interpreted in a broader way than merely as an
attempt to diagnose the cases presented. For example, recently it
has been suggested (10) that the neutralizing antibodies against
poliomyelitis virus in the sera of adults who have not had obvious
attacks of poliomyelitis are due to serological maturation instead of
contact with or of subclinical infections with the virus. From the
results of our experience with neutralization tests in connection with
louping ill virus it appears that the antibodies which we demonstrated
are not likely to arise in the absence of the active agent.
SU~Y
Four instances of infection in man which are believed, because of the
circumstances under which they occurred and in view of the results of
neutralization tests, to represent cases of louping ill have been de-
scribed. Evidence obtained by the neutralization tests is in favor of
the idea that the antibodies against louping ill virus demonstrated in
certain sera were most likely the result either of contact with or of
infection with the active agent.
