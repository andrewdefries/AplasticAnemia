Objective: Intractable anemia, such as aplastic anemia or that presumably associated with
chronic herpes virus infections, sometimes require bone marrow transplant. We investigated
the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of intractable anemia.
Method: Placenta Hominis (PH), steam boiled and roasted, and Cervi Cornus Colla (deer
antler glue) has been used in China for hundreds of years to treat anemia. After consent was
obtained, we prescribed these two materials for a 74-year-old female with aplastic anemia and
a 26-year-old male with presumably a virus-induced anemia. Concomitant conventional therapy
was continued in both patients as prescribed by their respective attending physicians.
Conclusion: Conventional therapy with steroid hormones, immunosuppressive drugs, platelet
and erythrocyte transfusions were not effective in these patients. In addition, both patients
suffered from serious side effects. In two patients, ingestion of Placenta Hominis and Cervi
Cornus Colla with TCM prescriptions increased the platelet and enhanced the hemoglobin
concentration in several months of therapy accompanied by a dramatic improvement in quality
of life. The addition to conventional therapy of PH and Cervi Cornus Colla, the latter of which
is very easy to obtain, may be one of the potentially advantageous choices in case of otherwise
intractable anemia.
Keywords: placenta, antler glue, Cervi Cornus Colla, anemia, aplastic anemia
Introduction
Patientswithaplasticanemiamanifestthesymptomsofbothanemiaandthrombocytopenia.
In aplastic anemia, pluripotent stem cells are dysfunctional and fail to produce a full
range of blood cells. This results in varying degrees of pancytopenia with hypocellular
bone marrow. The cause is often idiopathic, and the treatments include bone marrow
transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy, and supportive therapy, such as blood and
platelet transfusions and hematopoietic growth factors. For hundreds of years in China,
Placenta Hominis (PH; ‘ze he che’ in Chinese) has been used to tonify or regulate the
“blood” and also tonify the “essence”, in addition to warming “kidney”.1
The clinical disease of anemia, in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) principles,
can be understood to be a deficiency in “blood and essence”. These TCM theories are
hypotheses based on accumulated experiences in diagnosis and treatment and are not
yet proven by Western medicine.
We hypothesized that PH would work for anemia and applied for intractable
anemia.
In this paper, one 74-year-old female with acquired aplastic anemia and one 26-year-
old male with severe anemia and thrombocytopenia who were diagnosed at other

hospitals and did not respond to conventional therapy. They
were treated with TCM prescriptions. These includedPlacenta
Hominis and Cervi Cornus Colla (Deer Antler Glue; ‘lu jiao
jiao’ in Chinese). They responded with notable improvement
in blood examination paramaters and quality of life (QOL).
Materials and methods
In China, after complete lavage by traditional methods, PH2–4
is washed thoroughly, steam-sterilized, and roasted before
being sold on the market. We imported PH from Jin Mi Lan
YouXianGongsi (金米蘭有限公司;49–51,Bonham,Strand
West, 12/F, Bld. C-D, Hong Kong). PH was ground into pow-
der before adding it to a filtered decoction right after filtration
when the temperature was still near 100 °C. The mixture was
ingested after it had cooled to room temperature.
To make sure the powder was not harmful, the author
(YH) took 2 g/day for three days, 3 g/day for next three
days, and then continued an intake of 4 g/day for three days.
Fortunately, YH had no trouble but rather felt increased
vitality. Her mother also desired to take it because of her
continuing cough. She took 3 g/day for five days which was
when her cough stopped without any troubles.
Conventional therapy, such as immunosuppressive drugs
and prednisolone, was continued in conjunction with TCM
treatment, including PH and animal materials with the con-
sent of the patients.
The prescriptions for Case 1, a 74-year-old female, are
shown in Tables 1 and 2. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the
patient had been taking a photosensitizer dye for two years.
Cyclosporine and prednisolone were also being taken before
the TCM treatment was initiated. Granulocyte colony stimu-
lating factor (G-CSF) was transfused about once every two
weeks to prevent the white blood cell (WBC) levels from
decreasing below the appropriate limit.
The change in the hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and
platelet (Plt) count before TCM treatment is shown in
Figure 1.
For Case 2, the starting formula is provided in Table 3.
This included Radix Sanguisorbae Officinalis5
(di yu)
3 g/day and Flos Sophorae Japonicae5
(huai hua) 3 g/day
from March 31st to April 28th 1999 to stop bleeding. The
second formula (prescription 1) is shown in Table 4. Along
with this formula, PH (zi he che) 4 g/day and Notoginseng
Radix6
(san qi) 2 g/day were taken as well. The details are
shown in Figure 3.
The four diagnostic procedures of TCM which include
”Looking”, “Hearing”, “Asking” and “Feeling”, were carried
out on the first visit, as shown in Table 5 (Case 1) and Table 6
(Case 2).7
Case reports
Case 1
The patient first presented with purpura at another general
hospital in September 1999. She was examined thoroughly,
and diagnosed as having acquired aplastic anemia of
unknown etiology.
The changes in blood examination parameters since the
time of admission to that hospital are shown in Figure 1.

After several Plt transfusions, the Plt count increased to
87,000/µl, followed by a prompt decrease to 34,000/µl.
The minimum Plt count was 15,000/µl. Erythrocyte (red
blood cell [RBC]) transfusion seemed to provide a slight
increase in the Hb level, but it gradually decreased again.
When WBC count of normal leukocyte classification
decreased, G-CSF was transfused about once a fortnight. The
patient resumed photosensitizing dye on February 19, 2000
after an interruption of a two-year course of therapy while
being hospitalized. This seemed to improve the Hb level.
Therefore, RBC were not transfused, and the Hb maintainted
a relatively good level compared with the Plt level observed
since starting the photosensitizing dye. Though her fatigue
slightly improved, her anemia did not. As shown in Fig-
ure 2, examination just prior to consultation at the Hijikata
clinic in April 2000, revealed a Plt count of 36000/µl and
Hb level of 8.9 g/dl. On April 22nd, 2000, she presented to
the Hijikata clinic.
Her past history was notable for palpitation and hyper-
tension evident since 47 years of age, coincident with
menopause. She had been taking amlodipine with good
blood pressure control. As shown in Table 5, the results
determined by TCM diagnostic procedures utilizing the “Four
examinations” such as “Looking”, “Feeling”, “Hearing”, and
“Asking” are shown. She had a slippery, fine and weak pulse,
which in TCM indicates a Qi deficiency,6
a pale complexion,
which suggests “Blood” deficiency,7
and a blue, pale tongue
body color and a dark coloration of the vena sublingualis,
which suggests blood stasis.8
She exhibited purpura, suggest-
ing the “Spleen” was not properly regulating the “Blood”.9
She complained of appetite loss and severe constipation as
side-effects of the conventional therapy along with general
fatigue, which indicates a “Spleen” Qi deficiency.12
She also
complained of a cold feeling below the ankle, which indicates

a yang deficiency of the “Kidney”13
while also a sensitivity
to heat with hot palms and sweaty soles, which indicates a
general yin deficiency.14
Furthermore, she had insomnia,
considerable dream acitivity (yin deficiency).14
The slippery
pulse implied excessive body dampness and the moon face
suggested the presence of phlegm.
Finally, she was diagnosed as having “Spleen” Qi
deficiency, “Blood” deficiency, yin deficiency, yang defici­
ency, dampness, phlegm and blood stasis (Table 5).
Accordingly, we administered prescription A, modified
gui pi tang.15
In this prescription, it is considered that ren
shen, dang shen, shan yao, huang qi, and zhi gang cao tonify
the “Spleen”, ”Heart”, “Lung”, and “Kidney” Qi. Ze he che or
PH, dang gui, and long yan rou tonify the blood.16
PH warms
and tonifies the kidney as well. Pao fu zi, gan jiang, and ai ye
expel cold. Yu jin and san qi invigorate the blood, and ling
zhi tonifies the vital essence, as shown in Table 1.
In Figure 2, on April 28th, six days after starting TCM
therapy, the Plt count and Hb level increased from 36,000/µl to
47,000/µl and 8.9 g/dl to 9.6 g/dl, respectively. On May 12th,
30 days after TCM had started, Plt increased to 54,000/µl and
Hb to 9.8 g/dl. However, the patient complained of flatulence.
We added herb mixture B to prescription A to improve the
transport function of the digestive system. On June 27th, her
flatulence, constipation, Plt and Hb were unchanged, so we
added another herbal mixture C to distribute the liver Qi,
raise yang, clean heat, detoxify and promote the movement
of the Qi in the digestive system as well as tonify blood
(Table 2). To a small degree the Hb concentration and Plt
count increased, but the WBC decreased. The increase of
Hb and Plt after administration of prescription C might
imply Tabebuia Avellanedae (TA) may have some effect
which improve anemia, as well. This is because this is the
only herb to improve anemia among the herbs in mixture
C.17
She complained of excessive perspiration at night and
persistent constipation.
On July 27th, we added prescription D to treat night sweats
and to resolve blood stasis. Although initially Plt increased,
Hb did not respond at all. On October 16th, we added Cervi
Cornus Colla (lu jiao jiao)18
to tonify the “Kidney” yang so
as to nourish and tonify the “Kidney Essence” and “Blood”,
because cold feeling below the ankle persisted. Soon there-
after, Plt sharply increased and Hb increased from 9.1 to
9.9 g/dl. On December 15th, as she had requested treatment
of her fatty liver, a side effect of the conventional therapies,
we added Tinospora Tuberculata (ayurubeda’s herb) (F) to

Further improvement in Plt
and Hb was observed. Cyclosporine was reduced to 25 mg in
December 2000 which may have influenced the blood tests
somewhat.
When she presented on January 16th, 2001, her moon
face, night sweats, appetite loss, and fatigue had disappeared
almost completely. Although not entirely good, her blood
examination parameters have been stable so far.
Finally, the considerable improvement in the Plt count
and Hb concentration occurred after the administration of
prescription A, including PH and Cervi Cornus Colla , with
a small additional improvement after the administration of
Tabebuia Avellanedae and Tinospora Tuberculata.
Case 2
The patient had been suffering from tonsillitis, swollen
lymph nodes, and fever since August 1999. The fever
resolved with antibiotics, but general fatigue and yellowish
white sputum production continued. As a result of bone
marrow aspiration at a municipal hospital, he was suspected
to be in a chronic state of virus-associated hemophagocytic
syndrome.
He consulted Toyodo Hijikata clinic on March 18th,
2000, because no improvement had been observed in spite
of steroid treatment.
He had been suffering from empyema and nasal
obstruction since childhood. He reported palpitations
and shortness of breath. In Table 6, the findings and the
diagnosis based on TCM principles are shown. He had
a string-like rapid pulse (100/min) and his tongue body
color was very pale, which suggested severe anemia. The
vena sublingualis was slightly dark. Blood pressure was
150/70. His complexion was pale. He complained of general

Flos (huai hua) to stop hemorrhoidal bleeding by a cooling
of his “Blood” constitution.5
It worked dramatically. On
April 12th, his prednislone dose was reduced and cyclo-
sporine therapy initiated because the prednislone did not
work. As fatigue was present accompanied by dizziness,
he was asked to express his fatigue level with a numerical
rating scale NRS (maximum = 10, no fatigue = 0). Fatigue
and dizziness continued at the second visit on April 28th.
Accordingly, a second formula including animal material
such as Cervi Cornus COlla was administered (Table 4).
At the same time, PH (zi he che) 4 g/day and Notoginseng
Radix (san qi) 2 g/day were started and continued until all
of the TCM treatment was finished (Figure 3). Thereafter,
the Plt count and Hb level steadily increased, and dizziness,
along with fatigue, decreased. Anemia continued to improve
at each blood examination.
Previous administration of prednisolone had not improved
dizziness accompanied by fatigue. After starting MBZYQT,
however, it decreased a little. Blood examination continued
to improve until November 22nd, 2001.
After stopping TCM treatment, the patient gradually
decreased the conventional therapies. Approximately one
year later he was sufficiently recovered to go to work for
a company. His Plt count was 126,000/µl and Hb level,
15.1 g/dl. on December 1st, 2001 (Figure 3).
Discussion
Both cases received TCM therapy, including PH, together
with animal material such as Cervi Cornus Colla (Deer Antler
Glue) as well as conventional therapies for anemia. The PH
tonifies the “Kidney” yang in addition to nourishing the
“Blood”. The Cervi Cornus Colla (Deer Antler Glue) is a
cheaper and weaker substitute for deer velvet, which is expen-
sive, and similarly tonifies “Kidney” and fortifies the yang.13
The result was that administration of these two substances
caused an improvement in the Plt count, Hb concentration,
and QOL, without recrudescence thus far.
In these cases, PH and Cervi Cornus Colla would warm
and tonify the “Kidney” and augment the “Blood” and
“Essence” which indicates an influence of the “Marrow
system” by the “Kidney-Marrow” in TCM principles. The
“Marrow” produces the “Bone marrow” and fills the spinal
cord and the brain in TCM theory.23
However, as shown in Figure 3, the white cell classifica-
tion in Case 2 indicated a higher ratio of lymphocytes, which
coincides with the suggestion of a chronic state of virus-
associated hemophagocytic syndrome. Even in this case, these
two substances worked for the improvement of his anemia.
Animal materials can help to treat successfully certain
cases in which herbs do not work for intractable anemic
diseases. Because the human placenta must be removed com-
pletely from the uterus after childbirth and is then normally
discarded, there is a role for animal material in intractable
anemia as it is comparatively easy to obtain.
Patients with aplastic anemia or incurable anemia who
are awaiting bone marrow transplantation, usually wait for
some time before an human leukocyte antigen-matched
donor is found. In such a case, the intake of PH and animal
material beneficial to anemia may yield some improvement in
blood test parameters as well as patient symptoms, including
overall QOL. We believe TCM therapy including PH and
Cervi Cornus Colla will be one of the alternative choices for
treating otherwise intractable anemia.
However, it is important to be be careful not to apply too
much PH and Cervi Cornus Colla in patients with yin defi-
ciency.14
Because they warm the “Kidney”, leading to a general
warming of the body organs followed by aggravation of the yin
deficiency,whichresultinsymptomssuchascoughingupblood,
body heat such as “Steaming Bones”, and night sweats.1
Accordingly, there must be a careful watch of the clini-
cal course so as not to cause yin deficiencies by prescribing
excessive quantities of PH and Cervi Cornus Colla.
Finally, the specific mechanisms of actions of these
human and animal materials in anemia remain unclear. There-
fore this is an important subject for future investigation and a
greater number of clinical cases need to be accumulated.
