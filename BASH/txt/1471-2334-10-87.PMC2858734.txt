Abstract
Background: Co-infection with Plasmodium falciparum malaria and Parvovirus B19 in adults is an extremely rare
occurrence and, apparently, only one case has been previously reported. Herein we describe a case of acute
co-infection with severe anemia and renal failure.
Case presentation: The patient was a 34-year-old African man presenting myalgia, fatigue, headache, anemia and
hepatosplenomegaly. A thin peripheral smear showed Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites and the patient was
treated with oral mefloquine. After an initial amelioration, fever, fatigue and myalgia reappeared, the anemia
worsened and there was evidence of acute renal failure. No malarial parasites were found with a blood smear. A
bone marrow aspiration showed marked erythroid hypoplasia. Parvovirus B19-specific IgM and IgG and viremia
were positive. The patient was treated with steroids and blood cell transfusions. After ten days, anemia and renal
failure progressively decreased. When last seen, the patient was asymptomatic and the blood values were within
the normal range.
Conclusions: The diagnosis of Parvovirus B19 acute infection should be considered in any case of persistent severe
anemia and/or renal failure, even in clinical conditions that are well-known causes of anemia and renal failure, such
as malaria.
Background
Parvovirus B19 is the etiologic agent of erythema infec-
tiosum (fifth disease), although it may also be asso-
ciated with transient aplastic anemia. Malaria due
to Plasmodium falciparum is a protozoan disease
characterized by fever with chills and hepatosplenome-
galy. Possible complications are cerebral malaria,
anemia, haemoglobinuria, acute renal failure, and
spleen rupture.
Co-infection of Plasmodium falciparum malaria with
Parvovirus B19 in adults is a very rare occurrence and,
to the best of our knowledge, only one case has been
reported in the literature [1].
Therefore, both these pathogens are potent causes of
anemia and a co-infection could determine life-threaten-
ing anemia. Herein we describe a case of acute co-infec-
tion in an adult patient with severe anemia and renal
failure.
Case presentation
The patient was a 34-year-old African man immigrated
from Ghana and living in Italy for twenty years. He
returned to his native country in March 2007 for three
weeks, and one month after his return, he was hospita-
lized with high fever (up to 39°C), intense myalgia, fati-
gue, and headache. His was 190 cm high and weight
100 kg. A physical examination revealed only hepatos-
plenomegaly with a 2 cm liver enlargement and a 4 cm
spleen enlargement. Blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg.
A complete blood count showed the following patho-
logical values: hemoglobin 11.3 g/dl, total white blood
cells 5.100/mm3 (61.8% neutrophils, 29.8% lymphocytes
and 7.3% monocytes). The reticulocyte cell count was
3,65% and platelet count was 39.000 mm3. A mild
increase in transaminase levels was observed (ALT 84
IU/l, AST 102 IU/l). Creatininemia and blood urea were
within normal limits (respectively 0.9 mg/dl and 35 mg/
dL). Antibodies to Salmonella typhi, Brucella spp.,
Leishmania spp., Rickettsia, Cytomegalovirus and
Epstein-Barr virus were not detected; urine and stool
cultures were negative.

A thin peripheral smear showed Plasmodium falci-
parum trophozoites (parasitemia 5%). The patient was
treated with oral mefloquine at standard doses. After
four days fever subsided and parasitemia became unde-
tectable. However, two days later, fever, fatigue and
myalgia reappeared.
Haemoglobin level decreased to 7.1 g/dL, reticulocytes
were reduced to 0.4%, and there was evidence of acute
renal failure with creatininemia and azotemia levels of
5 mg/dl and 143 mg/dl, respectively. Chest X rays
revealed pleural effusion. No malarial parasites were
found on blood smear.
In light of this clinical situation, a bone marrow
aspiration was performed which showed marked ery-
throid hypoplasia. Parvovirus B19 specific IgM and IgG
(Bioelisa Parvovirus B19 Instrumentation Laboratory,
Milan, Italy) together with Parvovirus B19 viremia
(COBASAmpliPrep, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Man-
nheim, Germany) were positive. Due to the persistence
of anaemia and the evidence of bone marrow hypopla-
sia, the patient was treated with steroids for the throm-
bopenia, and blood cell transfusions (three units). After
ten days, the hemoglobin level was 11.7 g/dL, and signs
of renal failure progressively decreased (creatininemia
1.8 mg/dl and azotemia 60 mg/dl). A search for antibo-
dies to Parvovirus B19 was repeated, and the diagnosis
of acute Parvovirus B19 infection was confirmed (IgM
became negative, while IgG increased to higher titers.
After a further 20 days without steroid therapy, the
patient was asymptomatic and the blood values were
within the normal range.
The patient gave informed consent for the processing
of his data.
Parvovirus B19 is the etiologic agent of erythema
infectiosum (fifth disease), a common benign and
usually self-limited childhood exanthema, although it
may be associated with transient aplastic anaemia, espe-
cially in patients with chronic haemolytic anemia and/or
in immunocompromised hosts. Indeed, erythroid pre-
cursor cells represent the common target of Parvovirus
B19 [2-7].
When acute Parvovirus B19 infection occurs together
with other infections or clinical conditions associated to
haemolytic anaemia and/or dyserythropoiesis such as
malaria, as in the present case, the respective pathogene-
tical mechanisms leading to anemia could be synergistic,
thus further reducing the haemoglobin levels.
Anaemia in malaria can be associated with more
pathogenetic mechanisms, such as haemolysis and dys-
erythropoiesis. Erythroid precursor cells represent the
common target for Parvovirus B19 and Plasmodium fal-
ciparum and the co-infection may cause severe anemia
up to acute aplastic crises [2-7]. In the literature, only
one case is reported of coinfection with malaria and
Parvovirus B19 in a47 year-old Italian tourist returning
from Mali [1]. Similarly to our case, also fever and
severe anemia persisted after treatment for malaria was
discontinued, although renal failure was not evidenced.
Indeed, recent reports indicate a possible role for Par-
vovirus B19 in ‘idiopathic’ collapsing focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis, leading to acute renal failure [8-10].
The pathogenetical mechanisms of renal involvement
during Parvovirus B19 infection are unclear and can
include immune complexes deposition, direct cytopathic
effects, and autoantibody production [10].
If Parvovirus can determine, as documented above, an
anemia due to erythroid hypoplasia, anemia in malaria
can largely involve haemolysis. Moreover, also malaria is
a well-known cause of acute renal failure. In our case,
acute renal failure appeared several days after malaria
resolution, together with detection of IgM to Parvovirus
B19; in addition, the resolution of the complication
occurred at the moment of IgM clearance. Thus, we can
hypothesize that, even if acute renal failure could be
determined by the co-infection, Parvovirus B19 probably
played a major role in its onset.
Conclusions
In conclusion, in the light of the present experience, the
diagnosis of Parvovirus B19 acute infection should be
considered in any case of persistent severe anemia and/
or renal failure, even in clinical conditions that are well-
known causes of anaemia and renal failure, such as
malaria.
