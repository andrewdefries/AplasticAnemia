INTRODUCTION
Malignant hematologic disorders (multiple myeloma,
myelodysplasia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and Hod-
gkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma) and idiopathic aplas-
tic anemia that occur in the population with an incidence of
0.5-5/100,000 increase the surgical operative risk due to
coagulation defects, changes of blood viscosity, immuno-
suppression, and bone marrow insufficiency (1). Pancytope-
nia associated with idiopathic aplastic anemia may pose an
increased risk for postoperative bleeding and infection (2).
Here, we report a patient with severe aortic valve insuffi-
ciency undergoing bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement
who suffered from idiopathic aplastic anemia.
CASE REPORT
A 66-yr-old man was admitted to the hospital because of
shortness of breath. His dyspnea was classified by the New
York Heart Association (NYHA) as functional class III. The
patient’s history included treatment for severe aplastic ane-
mia with anti-thymocyte globulin and prednisone for 5 yr
prior to admission. Cyclosporin therapy for aplastic anemia
was declined because of reimbursement issues. Chest reont-
genography showed cardiomegaly. Echocardiography reveal-
ed reduced left ventricular function and severe aortic valve regur-
gitation (grade IV) with left ventricular end diastolic dimen-
sion measuring 87 mm. Coronary angiography revealed no
significant coronary artery stenosis. The presence of severe
dyspnea and echocardiographically documented severe aor-
tic valve insufficiency led us to schedule a surgery for elec-
tive aortic valve replacement.
On admission, laboratory testing showed leukocytopenia
(white blood cells 1,900/ L), anemia (hemoglobin 6.7 mM/
L), and thrombocytopenia (platelets 34,000/ L). The differ-
ential blood count revealed 42.9% neutrophils (50-70%),
42.3% lymphocytes (25-40%), 6.9% monocytes (2-8%),
and 4.3% eosinophils (2-4%).
Preoperative preparation included two weeks of granulo-
cyte colony-stimulating factor (NeupogenTM
300 g, Amgenc
,
subcutaneously three times a week), transfusion of four units
of packed red blood cells (RBCs), and ten units of platelet
concentrations (PCs) one day before the surgical procedure
resulting in a hemoglobin level of 9.8 mM/L, a leukocyte
level of 10,300/ L, and a platelet level of 120,000/ L pre-
operatively.
The patient received aortic valve replacement with a 21-
mm bioprosthetic aortic valve (Carpentier-EdwardsTM

Cardiac Surgery in a Patient with Idiopathic Aplastic Anemia:
A Case Report
Major surgery in a patient with pancytopenia might be associated with increased
surgical risks, especially for bleeding and infection. A 66-yr-old man was admitted
to the hospital due to shortness of breath. His dyspnea was classified by the New
York Heart Association (NYHA) as functional class III. Prior to admission, he had a
5-yr history of medical management for idiopathic aplastic anemia. The severity of
aplastic anemia of the patient was graded as non-severe aplastic anemia. Echocar-
diography revealed reduced left ventricular function and severe aortic valve regur-
gitation (grade IV) with left ventricular end diastolic dimension measuring 87 mm.
Because of dyspnea and echocardiographically documented aortic valve insuffi-
ciency, the patient underwent elective aortic valve replacement. Although extra-
corporeal circulation for valve operations might be associated with aggravation of
impaired blood cell function, the patient recovered from surgery uneventfully. Here,
we report a successful cardiac surgery with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary bypass
in a patient with severe aortic valve insufficiency and concomitant idiopathic aplas-
tic anemia.

an sternotomy; 2 milrione units of aprotinin were added to
the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit priming solution. The
time to extubation was 17 hr. On the second day after sur-
gery, atrial fibrillation deveolped and was successfully con-
verted with intravenous amiodarone. Antibiotic prophylaxis
was given using ceftriaxon (RocephinTM
, Roche, Basel, Swiss)
2 g intravenously over 6 days. The total amount of drainage
via a mediastinal chest tubes was 785 mL. The patient was
discharged from the intensive care unit 4 days after surgery
and was discharged from the hospital postoperative on day
11 with a leukocyte count 4,300/ L, hemoglobin of 6.2
mM/L, and a platelet count of 62,000/ L. After the surgery,
the patient received 5 units of RBCs and 20 units of PCs
until discharge. Perioperative laboratory findings are sum-
marized in Table 1. During the 6 months of follow-up, the
patient did well with a functional class of NYHA class I.
The chest radiography at 3 months post surgery showed a
decreased cardiac size.
DISCUSSION
According to the definition of the severity of aplastic ane-
mia (5), the patient’s aplastic anemia could be categorized as
non-severe aplastic anemia. Regardless of the severity of
aplastic anemia, pancytopenia itself still poses an increased
surgical risk.
As described by Christiansen et al. (1), two questions have
to be considered when cardiac surgery is indicated in patients
with a hematologic disorder causing pancytopenia.
Given the increased operative risk and the potential bene-
fit with regard to the life expectancy and quality of life, ag-
gressive surgical treatment has to be compared with conser-
vative treatment and the natural course of both, the hema-
tologic disorder and the cardiac disease. Our patient suffered
from severe dyspnea on exertion; the patient had stable idio-
pathic aplastic anemia and was under hematological super-
vision. Progressive deterioration of ventricular function was
documented on serial echocardiographic examinations. Both
symptomatic aortic regurgitation and impaired left ventric-
ular function led us to the decision to perform aortic valve
replacement for this patient.
Another important issue for this specific subset of patients
is perioperative management to decrease morbidity and mor-
tality (1). Idiopathic aplastic anemia is characterized by pan-
cytopenia. Potential complications are caused by a decreased
number or impaired function of blood cells; this condition
is aggravated by the cell damaging properties of extracorpo-
real circulation. In addition to meticulous surgical hemosta-
sis, substitution of various blood products is important to
reduce the risk of bleeding complications. Total amount of
the blood product transfused to this patient is regarded to
be acceptable considering the higher risk of bleeding in these
specific subset of patients.
Aprotinin has been shown to decrease blood loss and reduce
the use of blood products by at least 30%, in open heart sur-
gery (4). Thoracic drainage in our patient was 785 mL, which
was similar to that of other patients who required cardiac
surgery with a variety of malignant hematological disorders
(1, 3).
Another important aspect of perioperative care in these
patients is the increased risk for infections. It is of great im-
portance to perform surgery in aseptic conditions and to avoid
transmission of pathogenic microorganisms during the peri-
operative period. Our patient was discharged to the inten-
sive care unit prepared for an immunocompromised patient.
G-CSF was administered perioperatively for leukopenia as
described previously (3). Furthermore, we did not observe
any complication associated with G-CSF usage.
Anticoagulation therapy after bioprosthetic valve replace-
ment is well established. The patient received warfarin sodi-
um 2 days after surgery, and INR was maintained between
1.5 to 2.0. It was continued by 3 months after surgery. Dur-
ing follow up, we have noticed neither thrombotic nor hem-
orrhagic complications related to the anticoagulation therapy.
Finally, consistent with the report by Karsten et al. (3),
cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation is feasible in
patients with idopathic aplastic anemia, and it was not asso-
ciated with excessive complications that might be expected
in a patient with this disorder.
