Venous and arterial thromboembolic diseases are still the most frequent causes of death and disability in high-income countries.
Clinical anticoagulants are inhibitors of enzymes involved in the coagulation pathway, such as thrombin and factor Xa. Thrombin
is a key enzyme of blood coagulation system, activating the platelets, converting the ﬁbrinogen to the ﬁbrin net, and amplifying
its self-generation by the activation of factors V, VIII, and XI. Thrombin has long been a target for the development of oral
anticoagulants. Furthermore, selective inhibitors of thrombin represent a new class of antithrombotic agents. For these reasons, a
number of speciﬁc thrombin inhibitors are under evaluation for possible use as antithrombotic drugs. This paper summarizes old
and new interests of speciﬁc thrombin inhibitors described in diﬀerent animals.
1. Introduction
Thrombin is a multifunctional serine proteinase that cleaves
substrates after arginine (Arg) or lysine (Lys) residues [1].
This enzyme plays an important role in diﬀerent biological
phenomena, such as hemostasis, thrombosis, inﬂammation,
and proliferative response [2, 3].
Thrombin is the key enzyme of the blood coagulation
system, presenting many important biological functions,
such as the activation of platelets, conversion of ﬁbrinogen
to ﬁbrin, and feedback ampliﬁcation of coagulation. The
precise generation of thrombin at vascular injury sites is the
result of an ordered series of reactions collectively referred to
as blood coagulation cascade [4, 5].
2. Blood Coagulation
The hemostatic process is a host defense mechanism to
preserve the integrity of the closed high-pressure circulatory
system. This process must remain inactive but poised to
immediately minimize extravasations of blood from the
vasculature following tissue injury [6].
The blood coagulation cascade is initiated when suben-
dothelial tissue factor is exposed to the blood ﬂow following
either the damage or activation of the endothelium [7, 8].
After cellular activation by vascular trauma or an inﬂam-
matory stimulus, tissue factor becomes exposed and binds
to a serine protease, factor VIIa, already present in blood
[9, 10], and forms the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex,
in the presence of phospholipid and calcium (extrinsic
factor tenase), which activates the zymogens factor IX and
factor X [11]. The limited amounts of the serine protease
factor Xa produced generate picomolar concentrations of
thrombin, which initiates several positive feedback reactions
that sustain thrombin’s own formation and facilitates the
rapid growth of the blood clot or thrombus around the
area of vascular damage [12]. Thrombin partially activates
platelets and cleaves the procofactors factor V and factor
VIII generating the active cofactors factor Va and factor
VIIIa, respectively [13]. Factor VIIIa forms the intrinsic
factor tenase complex with the serine protease, factor IXa,
phospholipid, and calcium, on a membrane surface provided
by platelets and endothelial and other cells [14], and
activates factor X at a 50–100-fold higher rate than the
factor VIIa-tissue factor complex [15]. Factor Xa forms
the prothrombinase complex with the cofactor, factor Va,
phospholipid, and calcium on the membrane surface, which
is the primary activator of prothrombin [16]. The thrombin

produced further ampliﬁes its own generation by activating
factor XI [17] and completing the activation of platelets and
factors V and VIII [13]. Thrombin also cleaves ﬁbrinogen
[18] and factor XIII [19] to form the insoluble cross-linked
ﬁbrin clot [20] that forms the backbone of a thrombus or
blood clot [21, 22].
3. Thrombin
Thrombin plays a vital role in blood coagulation by promot-
ing platelet aggregation and by converting ﬁbrinogen to form
the ﬁbrin clot in the ﬁnal step of the coagulation cascade.
In addition, thrombin inﬂuences a number of other cellular
eﬀects. Besides promoting platelet aggregation, thrombin
also stimulates platelets to release mediators including
thromboxane A2, platelet factor 4, PDGF (platelet-derived
growth factor), and TGF-β (transforming growth factor-
β). Thrombin also plays a major role in the tracking of
inﬂammatory cells into sites of injury and is chemotactic
for a number of diﬀerent cell types including monocytes,
macrophages, and neutrophils. It also inﬂuences several key
processes of tissue repair [23].
Prothrombin is synthesized in the liver as a preproprotein
and undergoes a number of posttranslational processes
prior to secretion. It is converted to thrombin following
tissue injury by cleavage at two sites by factor Xa. The
resultant 39 kDa thrombin comprises two chains A-chain,
of 36 amino-acid residues in human, and B-chain, of 259
residues [2], cross-linked by four disulphide bonds (Figure 1)
that house a narrow groove containing the catalytic triad
consisting of His-57, Asp-102, and Ser-195. This groove is
hydrophobic and exhibits a preference for apolar amino
acids preceding Arg at a thrombin-susceptible bond such
as Leu Asp Pro Arg/Ser (where/represents the cleavage site).
The high speciﬁcity of thrombin towards its substrates and
receptors is conferred by its unique anion-binding exosite. In
addition, thrombin possesses three speciﬁcity pockets which
interact with inhibitors [23].
Thrombin shows the characteristic fold of the trypsin-
like serine proteases. However, it has some peculiarities
such as an unusual charge distribution. Although it has
an almost neutral isoelectric point, charged residues are
clustered, resulting in a pronounced electrostatic ﬁeld that
extends for a considerable distance beyond the molecular
surface. The thrombin tertiary structure can be represented
as shown in Figure 2, where the catalytic residues are at the
edge of a negatively charged surface patch; this acidic region
is sandwiched between two positive regions to the east and
northwest of the active site. These regions are called exosites.
The eastern positive patch at the base of the active site cleft,
called exosite-1, plays a role in the interaction with ﬁbrino-
gen [24–28], ﬁbrin, hirudin [29–31], thrombomodulin
[32–35], and thrombin receptor [34, 36–39].
The northwest patch (the heparin-binding site), called
exosite-2, is strongly positive. The heparin binding acceler-
ates complex formation of thrombin with the serine protease
inhibitors, antithrombin, and heparin cofactor II [40].
Prothrombin fragment F2 also binds to this site [41], which
prevents the thrombin inhibition during early coagulation
stages.
Thrombin acts in the blood coagulation and ﬁbrinolysis
systems, so it has pro- and anticoagulant functions. These
activities are regulated by the protease inhibitors: α2-mac-
roglobulin and serpins. Serpins are serine protease inhibitors
like antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, and proteinase nexin-
I. Thrombin inhibition by serpins is enhanced by the
presence of heparin [2].
4. Thrombin Inhibitors
Maintaining a balance between bleeding and clotting has
always been a challenge in treating coagulation disorders
[42]. The control of blood coagulation occurs not only by the
presence of enzymes in zymogen forms, but also by the pres-
ence of speciﬁc plasmatic inhibitors [43]. Simultaneously,
blood coagulation, ﬁbrinolytic system, and anticoagulant
proteins are activated to dissolve the clot and to limit blood
coagulation activation, respectively.
Arterial and venous thrombotic occlusive diseases are
the main causes for the evolution of myocardial infarction
and brain vascular accidents; inclusively, venous thrombosis
aﬀects one in 100 individuals each year [44]. Anticoagulation
therapy is used in many medical specialties as well as
the treatment of both venous and arterial thromboembolic
events. Heparins and vitamin K antagonists have long been
the anticoagulants of choice [45]. Although these agents
are eﬃcacious, their use is associated with a number of
drawbacks and here is a need for new anticoagulants that can
overcome their limitations [45].
Thrombin inhibitors are considered excellent candidates
for therapeutic applications [46–48]. Direct inhibitors of
coagulation proteins targeting a single enzyme in the coag-
ulation cascade have been developed in recent years [45].
Direct thrombin inhibitors are a new class of anticoagulants
that bind directly to thrombin and block its interaction
with its substrates. Direct thrombin inhibitors do not bind
to plasma protein resulting in a more predictable antico-
agulant response than is seen with heparin [42]. Besides
endogenous thrombin inhibitors, such as antithrombin and
α2Macroglobulin, many studies have been done to ﬁnd an
eﬃcient and speciﬁc thrombin inhibitor.
The inhibition of thrombin activity has been useful in
a number of clinical conditions. Thrombin inhibitors are
predominantly used as antithrombotic therapy (anticlotting)
and have been particularly important in acute myocardial
infarction. Inhibitors are also used for the prophylaxis
and treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary
embolism and the prevention of arterial reocclusion fol-
lowing endarterectomies and endovascular stent deployment
[23].

4.1. Anticoagulant Molecules Secreted by Blood-Sucking Ani-
mals. In nature, there are many animals adapted to a diet of
fresh blood, and they had to evolve mechanisms to control
their host coagulation processes. In general, a stress due
to the bite will lead to a host inﬂammatory response with
a large number of leucocytes in the injured site. Leeches
challenge overtake to block peripheral noniception eﬀect
during the bite to reduce local inﬂammation, but they also
have to synthesize anticoagulants to maintain the blood
in a ﬂuid state during intake and subsequent digestion.
Thus, leeches found a way to avoid the leucocytes migration
because, during the long period of time necessary for blood
meal digestion, leucocytes would release protein blood-
degrading enzymes [49, 50]. Concerning this issue, a variety
of coagulation inhibitors have been isolated from blood-
sucking animals such as bats [51], ticks [52, 53], leeches
[54, 55], and hookworms [56]. Among these inhibitors,
hirudin, from a leech species, was the ﬁrst thrombin inhibitor
isolated and studied.
Hirudin was the ﬁrst thrombin inhibitor used in clinical
agent development. Hirudin was originally isolated from
the salivary glands of the medical leech Hirudo medicinalis
[57]. It is a polypeptide composed by 65 amino acids,
which tightly and speciﬁcally binds to ∝-thrombin, in a
1 : 1 stoichiometry with Ki about 20 fM. It interacts with
thrombin catalytic site and exosite-1, preventing ﬁbrinogen
cleavage and consequently clot formation. Hirudin also
inhibits thrombin agonist action upon the platelet aggre-
gation and the activation of factors V, VIII, and XIII [58–
60]. Other hirudin variants have been isolated from diﬀerent
species of leeches. These variants diﬀer from hirudin in both
length and amino-acid composition, even though they show
the same high inhibitory potency [61–63]. Hirudin itself
is not commercially available; however, its discovery led to
the development by recombinant technology of derivatives,
namely, lepirudin and desirudin. Hirudin and its synthetics
peptides have been tested in clinical trials [64–67]. Lepirudin
is available in the United States, whereas desirudin is available
in Europe [68, 69].
The leech Hirudinaria manillensis produces two throm-
bin inhibitors: hirullin P6 [70] and hirullin P18 [70–
73]. They showed 62% and 52% sequence homologies to
hirudin, respectively. In spite of the diﬀerences in C-terminal
segment, the number and distribution of acidic-amino acid
residues are similar. The presence of an Arg residue in
position 2 of hirullin P6 should be pointed out for its possible
interaction with the active site of thrombin, which may
account for the higher inhibitory potency of hirullin P6 when
comparing to hirudin from Hirudo medicinalis P18 [48].
Another tight-binding thrombin inhibitor is haemadin,
isolated from the leech Haemadipsia sylvestris, which also
contains an Arg residue at position 2 of the sequence. It does
not inhibit other proteases and does not reveal any homology
to known serine protease inhibitors, including hirudin [62].
Theromin is the most potent thrombin inhibitor, which
was isolated from the gut of the leech Theromyson tessulatum
[63]. It is a homodimer of 67 amino-acid residues, with
16 Cys residues engaged in eight disulﬁde bridges. Compared
with hirudin, both peptides are anionic and rich in Cys
residues. Theromin does not have sequence homology with
any other protease inhibitor yet sequenced throughout the
animal kingdom [63].
There are also thrombin inhibitors present in blood-
sucking arthropods, like triabin, a new potent thrombin
inhibitor isolated from the saliva of the blood-sucking
insect Triatoma pallidipenis [74]. It is a 142-residue pro-
tein, which speciﬁcally binds to thrombin forming a 1 : 1
noncovalent complex. Triabin has been shown to be a highly
4 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology
potent exosite thrombin inhibitor; it inhibits thrombin-
induced platelet aggregation and prolongs both thrombin
clotting time (TT) and activated partial thromboplastin
time (APTT); meanwhile it only minimally reduces the
amidolytic activity of this enzyme toward small chromogenic
substrates. In addition, triabin is able to completely block
trypsin-catalyzed cleavage of thrombin and to inhibit the
thrombomodulin-mediated activation of protein C in a
dose-dependent fashion. Triabin contacts the thrombin
molecule exclusively at exosite-1. A total of 19 and 13 residues
from triabin and thrombin, respectively, are in direct contact
[74].
Another thrombin inhibitor isolated from a blood suck-
ing insect is rhodniin, a highly and potent thrombin inhibitor
isolated from the assassin bug Rhodinius prolixus [75]. It
binds to thrombin with a peculiar interaction mechanism,
presenting multiple interactions between them, forming a
1 : 1 complex. Rhodniin is a small protein of 103 amino
acids, structurally organized into two Kazal-type domains,
linked via an acidic extended peptide fragment [75]. In
1999, another inhibitor similar to rhodniin was described,
dipetalogastin from the insect Dipetalogaster maximus [76].
Dipetalogastin acts as a slow, tight-binding inhibitor of
thrombin, and its activity to thrombin is in the pM range.
The cDNA of dipetalogastin codes for a large protein
which consists of six Kazal-type domains. There are three
tandem, homologous regions each including two domains
[77]. Recently, another inhibitor similar to rhodniin was
described: infestin from the kissing bug Triatoma infestans
midgut, one of the most important Chagas disease vectors
in Brazil [78]. Infestin 1-2 is a double Kazal-type domain;
it strongly inhibits thrombin with Ki in pM range. Infestin
full-length DNA revealed a protein containing seven Kazal-
type domains which is pos-translational processed creating
double or single domains with thrombin, factor XIIa or neu-
trophil elastase inhibitory activities [78–80]. Recently, it was
conﬁrmed that those intestinal Kazal-type domains, such as
rhodniin, dipetalogastin, and infestin 1-2 may be important
to maintain the blood ﬂuid during acquisition and storage
by gene silence using RNA interference of brasiliensin, a
thrombin inhibitor from Triatoma brasiliensis [81].
A potent and speciﬁc inhibitor of the human coagulation
thrombin activity was puriﬁed from salivary gland extracts
of the tsetse ﬂy, Glossina morsitans morsitans, and an
important vector of African trypanosomiasis. It is a low
molecular weight peptide (MW = 3,530 Da). Amino terminal
sequencing of the peptide reveals no homology to any
previously identiﬁed serine protease inhibitor or natural
occurring anticoagulant. In addition, it is also a potent
inhibitor of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation [82, 83].
Ticks are as important as insects as vectors of disease-
causing agents to humans and livestock [84].
The coagulation inhibitors and platelet aggregation
inhibitors (PAIs) present in the saliva of hard and soft
ticks have been extensively reviewed [85–88]. Thrombin
inhibitors isolated from salivary glands of Ornithodoros
moubata and Ornithodoros savignyi, respectively, named
ornithodorin and savignin, have been described [53, 89–
91]. Both proteins are similar. They contain two Kunitz-type
domains and they need both domains to inhibit thrombin
in a similar manner as rhodniin. These inhibitors bind
thrombin to both the active site and to exosite-1 [92]. Amblin
is the ﬁrst thrombin inhibitor isolated from ixodid tick
haemolymph of Amblyomma hebraeum. It is composed of
151 amino acids and contains 14 cysteines and two Kunitz-
like domains [93]. Another interesting thrombin inhibitor
described is boophilin, from the ixodid tick, Rhipicephalus
(Boophilus) microplus, which has 12 cysteines distributed
in two Kunitz-type domains that interact with thrombin
by diﬀerent manner when compared to that of hirudin or
rhodniin [94].
The crystal structure analysis highlights that many nat-
ural inhibitors from blood-sucking animals known to date
bind thrombin to both the active site and to exosite-1. The
latter interaction is as important as the binding to the active
site, since it enhances not only the aﬃnity of the inhibitor
for thrombin, but also the selectivity, thus preventing the
proteolytic cleavage of the inhibitors by other proteases [48].
4.2. Plasma Thrombin Inhibitors. Antithrombin, a serine
protease inhibitor (serpin), is an important anticoagulant
molecule in mammalian circulatory system [98]. The human
antithrombin is a glycoprotein composed by one chain of
58 kDa, with plasmatic concentration at 29 mg/dL. Prefer-
ably, it inhibits free enzymes; meanwhile the complex tenase
and prothrombinase enzymes are less accessible to it. It is
the most eﬀective, well-regulated inhibitor of coagulation
proteases, such as thrombin; factors IXa, Xa, and XIa;
plasmin; and plasmatic kallikrein; moreover, antithrombin
is believed to play a major role in controlling blood
coagulation, thereby preventing widespread thrombosis [99].
The glycosaminoglycan heparin is a positive eﬀector, which
can enhance antithrombin activity 1000-fold [100–102].
Antithrombin and heparin thus form an interdependent
regulatory mechanism of the coagulation process [103]. Inhi-
bition by antithrombin involves the formation of a stable 1 : 1
complex between the active domain of the serine protease
and the reactive site of antithrombin; the protease initially
recognizes the inhibitor as a substrate. During the cleavage
of the antithrombin reactive site bond, a conformational
change occurs in the inhibitor that traps the protease,
making it an irreversible inhibitor [100]. The antithrombin
physiology role is to limit the blood coagulation process to
the vascular local injury and to protect the circulation from
released enzymes.
Our group has isolated antithrombin from Bothrops
jararaca snake plasma by aﬃnity chromatography using
HiTrap Heparin HP column and its molecular weight,
amino-terminal sequence, carbohydrate content, and iso-
electric point; inhibition of bovine thrombin and immuno-
logical properties were studied and compared with pre-
viously described antithrombins [95]. Bothrops jararaca
antithrombin is a single-chain glycoprotein with 18% total
carbohydrate content. The molecular weight of Bothrops
jararaca antithrombin was 61 kDa by SDS-PAGE, and the
inhibitor exhibited an acidic isoelectric point (4.5). The
amino-terminal sequence determined was His-Glu-Ser-Ser-
Val-Gln-Asp-Ile-Ile-Thr, which is highly homologous to

mals. Immunological cross-reactivity was observed among
ﬁsh, frog, chicken, human, nonvenomous snake, and Both-
rops jararaca antithrombins. Bothrops jararaca antithrom-
bin showed inhibitory activity upon human and Bothrops
jararaca coagulation and human thrombin amidolytic activ-
ity using synthetic substrate S-2238 [95].
Nahas et al. (1973) have described an inhibitor in snake
plasma “Bothrops jararaca”, diﬀerent from antithrombin,
which also interferes in thrombin coagulant activity, mea-
sured by thrombin time; however, it does not block the
activation of blood coagulation extrinsic pathway, permitting
the occlusion of injured vessel. This inhibitor shows simi-
larities with heparin, like protamin susceptibility, but diﬀers
from this in being thermolabile and not being adsorbed with
BaSO4 and Al(OH)3. Our group isolated this protein, the
Bothrops jararaca inhibitor (BjI), a glycoprotein showing two
polypeptide chains with molecular masses of 109/138 and
150/219 kDa on SDS-PAGE in reducing and nonreducing
conditions, respectively. However, the BjI presents a molec-
ular mass about 1000 kDa in native conditions, suggesting an
oligomeric form containing around ﬁve 200 kDa polypeptide
chains in the native BjI. Thus, the intermonomer interactions
of the BjI native form should be very weak, which could
explain the lower protein molecular mass in SDS-PAGE [96].
BjI prolongs the blood coagulation intrinsic pathway; by
contrast, it does not aﬀect the extrinsic pathway [104].
BjI is an anticoagulant inhibitor that aﬀects speciﬁcally
thrombin. As it does not inhibit the thrombin amidolytic
activity, it does not interact with the catalytic site of thrombin
[105]. This feature diﬀerentiates BjI from antithrombin
and other thrombin inhibitors previously described such
as ornithodorin [82] and hirudin [57]. The BjI inhibitory
activity is not increased by heparin; on the other hand, it
increases the thrombin amidolytic activity, which suggests a
structural conformation change when BjI binds to thrombin,
facilitating the access of small chromogenic substrates to the
enzyme active site [96]. Regarding thrombin exosite-1 large
groove geometry, it is conceivable that two diﬀerent ligands
may be docked simultaneously [31]. The fact that BjI inhibits
coagulant thrombin activity but not platelet aggregation
activity indicates that this inhibitor does not bind to exosite-
1 or it binds in a subsite other than glycoprotein Ib.
A second thrombin high positive charge density surface
region designated by “anion exosite-2” is involved in heparin
binding [2]. Many of the basic residues involved in thrombin
interaction with heparin also act in prothrombin activation
fragment 2 binding [41]. Occupancy of exosite-2 by fragment
2 or chondroitin sulfate has been suggested to alter thrombin
conformation resulting in the altered calcium dependence
of protein C activation [106]. This is consistent with the
6 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology
observation that interaction with exosite-2 may induce
conformational changes in the catalytic center of thrombin
[107]. Therefore, exosite-2 might also act in cooperation
with exosite-1 for thrombin binding to ﬁbrinogen [25] and
platelets [25]. BjI seems to interact with exosite-2 close to
the heparin-binding site, which results in increased thrombin
amidolytic activity to small synthetic substrates, and can
interfere in the thrombin heparin binding [96].
Our group has identiﬁed proteins similar to BjI in the
plasma of three diﬀerent species of viperid snakes Bothrops
alternatus, Bothrops jararacussu, and Crotalus durissus terriﬁ-
cus. These proteins exhibited molecular masses of 109 and/or
138 kDa and were immunologically related to BjI [108]. They
also inhibited the coagulant activity of thrombin, evaluated
by the thrombin time test. These ﬁndings demonstrated the
presence of proteins similar to BjI in these three species,
although such inhibitor could not be observed in all the
samples of the specimens tested. Moreover, the presence of
these proteins in the plasma is related to the prolongation
of thrombin time, implying a relationship between these
proteins and their inhibitory coagulant activity upon throm-
bin. Our results suggest that BjI-like proteins are widely
distributed among Crotalinae snakes found in Brazil [108].
These characteristics of BjI make it an interesting protein
not only for studies on the blood coagulation evolutionary
view but also for its possible use as a tool in drug design to
generate speciﬁc antithrombotic.
The inhibitors cited in the text were presented in Table 1.
5. Conclusions
This paper is the ﬁrst in this area, collecting thrombin
inhibitors from diﬀerent animal sources, vertebrates and
invertebrates, either with or without clear physiological
function such as in hematophagous invertebrates and snakes.
Human health can be helped by using animals as a source of
several biodrugs. Pharmaceutical industry has been looking
for active molecules by using the biodiversity of the world,
which includes plants and animals. A huge number of
proteins and peptides have been identiﬁed and characterized
enabling the rational design of small molecular weight
compounds or peptomimetics [109].
