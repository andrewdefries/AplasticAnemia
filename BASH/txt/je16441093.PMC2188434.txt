Several common clinical and biochemical abnormalities characterize mamma-
lian hosts with chronic illness caused by infection or malignant disease. These
abnormalities include fever, a catabolic state resulting in a severe wasting dia-
thesis, and increased specific serum proteins referred to as acute-phase proteins
(1, 2). In addition to the above derangements, many reports have described a
marked hypertriglyceridemia, which occurs in animals in response to tumors (3,
4), endotoxemia (5-8), and bacterial (9, 10), viral (11), and protozoal infections
(12). Several investigators have demonstrated that in these animals, development
of hypertriglyceridemia is associated with elevation of very low-density lipopro-
teins (VLDL)' (3, 4, 12). The high levels ofthis lipoprotein result from a clearing
defect caused by suppression of thekey enzyme of plasma triglyceride metabolism
(13), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (5, 6, 7, 10, 12). In vitro and in vivo studies (14-
17) have revealed that this suppression of LPL activity can be mediated by
cachetin and/or IL-1, both of which are factors produced by activated macro-
phages. Interestingly, the N-terminal sequence of cachectin has recently (18)
been discovered to be strongly homologous to tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and
purified cachectin possesses TNF cytolytic activity, indicating that cachectin and
TNF are identical. In addition, one or more mediators released by activated
macrophages in vitro have been shown (19) to regulate other key lipogenic
processes, i.e., by suppressing enzymes important in de novo fatty acid biosyn-
thesis, such as acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase. These

data suggest that reticuloendothelial cells may provide a communication link
between the body's immunoregulatory and energy storage systems.
IFN-,y is a lymphokine derived primarily from T cells, which has important
antiviral, antimicrobial, and antiproliferative properties (20) . In addition, it is a
potent immunoregulator, particularly of macrophage activity (21). However,
interaction between this molecule and lipid metabolic pathways has not been
previously described. We report that cancer patients treated with rIFN-1' develop
consistent derangements in lipid metabolism. These derangements bear a strong
resemblance to the hypertriglyceridemic state, described in animals in response
to invasive stimuli, and attributed to monokine induction.
Materials and Methods
Interferon. The rIFN-y used in this investigation is identical in sequence to native
human IFN-y, except for the presence of a methionine residue at the N-terminal (22).
This material was produced in Escherichia coli, using recombinant DNA technology (23,
24). The final product is >98% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE, and contains <0.5 ng
endotoxin per milligram of protein by the limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (data on file;
Genentech Inc.). The specific activity of rIFN-y is ^-2 X 10' U/mg protein, based on
antiviral activity assessed by inhibition of encephalomyocarditis virus replication in A549
cells (human lung carcinoma cell line), corrected to the reference IFN-y standard Gg 23-
901-530 ofthe National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.
Study Design. Patients with histologic proof of malignancy were entered on phase I
and II studies of rIFN-y (25). In the phase I study, a minimum of two patients were
entered sequentially at each of the following dose levels: 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0 .25, 0 .50, and
1 .0 mg/m2/d ofrIFN-y, i.m. In the phase II study, patients received i.m. rIFN-y at a dose
of 0.25 mg/m2/d for the first week and 0.5 mg/m /d thereafter. The duration of treat-
ment was 42 d. Informed consent was obtained from each patient.
Blood samples for triglyceride and cholesterol levels were drawn on day 0 and then
weekly during the study period. All patients had fasted for 12 h before having their blood
drawn . After we stopped rIFN-y therapy, we continued to monitor blood lipid levels
weekly until they returned to baseline values. Our preliminary observations of increasing
triglyceride levels in several patients prompted the addition of blood tests for lipoprotein
electrophoresis, post-heparin lipase activity, and serum TNF titers.
Lipoprotein Electrophoresis . Blood was obtained for lipoprotein electrophoresis on days
0 and 14, after a 12-h fast. Lipoproteins were resolved from serum by agarose gel
electrophoresis. The gels were stained with Sudan Red dye.
Lipase Activity after Heparin Injection. On days 0 and 14, patients received an i.v.
injection of 100 U/kg of heparin. 20 min later, 10 ml of blood was drawn and immediately
placed on ice. Post-heparin lipase levels were measured after separation of total lipase by
affinity chromatography. 0.5 ml of plasma was incubated in the cold with 0.5 ml of
heparin-Sepharose and 0.5 ml of 0.3 M NaCI, buffered to pH 7 .4 with 5 mM barbital.
After washing the heparin-Sepharose with 2 .0 ml of the same 0.3 M NaCl buffer, total
lipase was eluted with the same buffer containing heparin at 10 g/liter (26). The enzymatic
assay was performed using the method of Voyta et al. (27) . Triplicate determinations
were made for each blood sample.
Assayfor Inhibition ofLipase Enzymatic Activity In Vitro. To determine whether rIFN-y
is able to directly inhibit lipase enzymatic activity, the following experiment was per-
formed. Post-heparin plasma from a normal healthy donor was subjected to affinity
chromatography on heparin-Sepharose, as described above. The fraction containing the
enzymatic activity was then aliquoted into tubes containing serial dilutions ranging from
0.003 to 300 ttg/ml of rIFN-y, as well as a control tube with buffer only. After a 30-min
preincubation, the lipase/rIFN-y mixtures and the control were used in the standard
lipase assay, in triplicate. Similar experiments were also performed using highly purified
LPL isolated from cow's milk (28).
KURZROCK ET AL. 1095
TNF Assays. Blood was obtained for serum TNF assays at three time points, i.e.,
before and 4 h after the first injection of rIFN--y, and during the second week of therapy.
Blood samples were centrifuged, and the serum was decanted and stored at 0°C until
analysis. Serum TNF titers were measured by an ELISA at Genentech, Inc. A solid-phase
ELISA was performed using a sandwich technique with two polyclonal antibodies to TNF,
one of which was conjugated to a horseradish peroxidase label. The lower limit of
sensitivity of the assay is 50 pg/ml.
Results
Patient Characteristics. Triglyceride and cholesterol values were evaluated for
30 patients treated sequentially on our phase I and 11 studies who received i .m.
rIFN-y for 14 consecutive days without dose reductions. 16 male and 14 female
patients participated in the study, and they ranged in age from 23 to 70 yr old
(median age, 45 yr). Performance status, according to the Karnofsky criteria
(29), was excellent (median, 80%; range, 75-100%). At the start of the study,
patients' weights were 85-210% (median, 112%) of ideal body weight (30). 21
patients had solid tumors: 6 with renal cell carcinoma, 5 melanoma, 4 colon
carcinoma, 3 sarcoma, 2 cases of breast cancer, and 1 patient with lung adeno-
carcinoma. Nine patients had hematological malignancies, including five with
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, two with chronic myelogenous leukemia, and two
with lymphoma .
Side Effects. Fever, chills, and fatigue were the most common side effects of
rIFN-y therapy, and were encountered in virtually all patients (31). At doses
<_0.5 mg/m2/d, these symptoms were tolerated with minimal change in perform-
ance status, and they tended to diminish after the initial 4-5 d of therapy.
Patients were instructed to follow their normal dietary habits during the study
and were encouraged to drink fluids. Nevertheless, weight loss occurred in most
patients. The median weight lost after 2 wk of therapy was 0.5 kg; after 6 wk,
1 .5 kg. Mild nausea and anorexia occurred in about one-third of patients during
the initial week of therapy. Vomiting did not occur. Since daily caloric counts
were not assessed, it is not clear whether these symptoms accounted for the
weight loss . Mild hepatic dysfunction (elevation in liver enzymes to two to three
times baseline levels) occurred in 11 of 30 patients; mild proteinuria (1+ by
urine dipstick), in 2 of 30 patients. No other significant changes in renal function,
as measured by blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, were observed.
Blood Lipid Levels. Hypertriglyceridemia was one of the most common effects
observed after rIFN-y therapy. 23 of 30 (77%) patients showed a >25% increase
in triglyceride levels on day 14 with respect to baseline levels (Fig. 1). The
increase usually occurred by day 7 of therapy, peaked between the second and
third week, and then remained stable. In general, triglyceride values returned
to baseline levels within 2-3 wk after discontinuation of rIFN-y injections.
Elevation of triglyceride levels appeared to be dose-related. Only 1 of 7 (14%)
patients treated with a dose <0 .25 mg/m2/d, vs. 22 of 23 (96%) patients treated
with ?0.25 mg/m2/d of rIFN-y showed an increase in triglyceride values (p <
0.001, Fisher's exact test). However, increasing the dose above 0.25 mg/m2/d
did not result in an increase in the magnitude of triglyceride elevation ; the mean
increases in triglyceride values at doses of 0.25, 0.5, and 1 .0 mg/m2/d were 170,
217, and 140 mg/dl, respectively. The mean ±SD of the day 0 triglyceride levels

for the 23 patients treated with >_0.25 mg/m2/d of rIFN-y was 180 ± 190 mg/dl,
vs. a level of 370 ± 242 mg/dl on day 14 (p <0.001, paired t test). Changes in
triglyceride level did not correlate with rIFN-y-induced changes in hepatic or
renal function. Changes in cholesterol levels were not statistically significant.
Lipoprotein Electrophoresis. To characterize this hyperlipidemia, we also per-
formed lipoprotein electrophoresis on 12 patients, before, and 14d after they
received >_0.25 mg/m
2
/d of rIFN-y. Representative data are shown in Fig. 2.
On day 0, 2 of 12 (17%) patients had a type 4 hyperlipoproteinemia pattern,
while the other 10 patients had a normal lipoprotein profile. On day 14, 11 of
12 (92%) patients manifested a type 4 hyperlipoproteinemia profile . A type 4
profile was defined by the presence of high triglyceride levels, absence of a
cream-like layer of chylomicrons on visual inspection of the serum, and an
increased pre-# fraction (VLDLs) on lipoprotein electrophoresis.
Post-heparin Lipase Activity. Mechanisms that could account for increased
triglyceride values with high VLDLs include enhanced synthesis or decreased
clearance. Triglyceride clearance from the circulation is dependent on the action
of the enzyme, LPL (32). This enzyme (as well as hepatic lipase) is released into
the plasma after the administration of heparin. Therefore, post-heparin lipase

was evaluated on six of the above patients. These patients showed a significant
decrease in their total plasma lipolytic activity from a mean baseline rate of 2.1
Ftmol/ml/h to a day 14 rate of 1 .2 tumol/ml/h (p = 0.02, paired t test), concomitant
with a rise in plasma triglyceride levels and VLDL content (Table I). The
enzymatic assay used here does not distinguish between the two lipases released
after heparin injection, hepatic and lipoprotein lipase. However the preferred
substrate for LPL is the VLDL class of lipoproteins, whereas hepatic lipase
prefers high-density lipoproteins (33, 34). Since the triglyceride elevations seen
here are due to increases in VLDL-associated triglyceride, it is reasonable to
assume that the changes in lipase activity are most likely a reflection of LPL
activity.
Effect of rIFN-7 on Lipase Activity In Vitro. Inhibition of LPL after rIFN-y
therapy could be due to a direct effect of rIFN-y, or possibly to a mediator
induced by rIFN-y. To determine whether rIFN--y directly inhibits lipase enzy-
matic activity, we analyzed the in vitro effect of rIFN--y on lipase isolated from
human post-heparin plasma and on cow's milk LPL. Levels of rIFN-y ranging
from 0.003 to 300 Ag/ml did not decrease the enzymatic activity. We have
previously reported (25) that the peak interferon levels usually detected in
patients' serum, after Lm. injection of rIFN-y at doses of 0.25-1 .0 mg/m2/d, are
-y4-10 ng/ml.
Serum TNF Levels. An indirect mechanism of LPL suppression could involve
rIFN-y-induced production of cachectin/TNF or another monokine. At the
times tested, i.e., preinjection, 4 h after the first injection, and at a single point
during the second week of rIFN-y therapy, serum TNF titers were below the
limits of sensitivity of our ELISA (50 pg/ml).
In this study, administration of rIFN-y to cancer patients resulted in marked
alterations in lipid metabolism. Hypertriglyceridemia occurred almost uniformly
at doses >0.25 mg/m2/d (Fig. 1). Elevated triglyceride levels were associated

with increased VLDLs and decreased post-heparin lipase activity, indicating
impaired triglyceride removal (Table I and Fig. 2). Since remarkably similar
metabolic abnormalities have been described (3, 4) in chronic illness-induced
cachectic states in animals, our observations suggest that rIFN-7 may play a role
in the human body's response to malignancy. Furthermore, the serum levels of
interferon achieved after injection of 0.25 Mg/M2/d of rIFN-'y are in the same
range (mean peak titer, 4 ng/ml or 80 U/ml [25]) as those reported (35) in
pathophysiological circumstances (mean peak titer in aplastic anemia, 90 U/ml),
supporting the potential relevance of these data to chronic illness in man.
This hyperlipidemia could be caused by either direct or indirect mechanisms:
(a) suppression of lipase enzymatic activity, (b) reduction in lipase production,
or (c) stimulation of macrophages to release a mediator(s) that act on lipase. In
vitro preincubation of rIFN-y at levels up to 30,000-fold greater than those
usually achieved in patients' serum after i.m. injection (25) had no effect on
isolated human plasma lipase activity . Therefore, interferon's actions are prob-
ably not due to direct suppression of LPL enzymatic activity. Several lines of
evidence suggest the possibility of an indirect mechanism involving monokine
induction. In this respect, it has been shown that activated macrophages release
one or more mediators that are capable of decreasing LPL activity in vitro (16,
17), and in animals afflicted with chronic infection or cancer (12-16). IFN-y is
a powerful macrophage activator both in vitro (21) and in man (36, 37). The
monokine most extensively studied in relation to this phenomenon is cachec-
tin/TNF. Cachectin/TNF decreases LPL activity in vitro, binds to high-affinity
receptors on adipocytes (16), and at the molecular level, suppresses adipocyte
gene transcription (38). Since the clearance of TNF after i.v. administration in
man is rapid (J. Gutterman, unpublished observations), the negative ELISAs for
serum TNF in our patients do not preclude its involvement. However, in vitro
data indicating that IFN-7 alone is an insufficient stimulus for cachectin/TNF
release (39) argue against TNF/cachectin being the effector molecule inducing
hypertriglyceridemia in our patients. Another monokine that might mediate
these metabolic abnormalities is IL-1, a molecule that also inhibits LPL activity
in vitro (17), and the production of which can be stimulated by IFN-'Y (40).
Further investigation is required to determine whether or not these monokines
play an important role in rIFN-y-induced hypertriglyceridemia . In addition, a
direct effect of rIFN-'y on LPL biosynthesis cannot be ruled out as the mechanism
of action.
Beutler et al. (16) have hypothesized that, in response to infection or tumor,
activated macrophages may function as an "endocrine system" releasing a "hor-
mone," i .e ., cachectin/TNF and/or another monokine, that influences the be-
havior of adipocytes by binding to specific receptors. Therefore, secretion of
immune mediators during chronic illness may serve to mobilize energy reserves
from adipose cells preferentially for the immune system, and eventually result in
the marked catabolic state, termed cachexia, which is a clinical hallmark of
cancer. To date, the work on which these hypotheses are based has been
performed in vitro and in animal models. Our observations show that rIFN-7, a
lymphokine with pleiotropic immunomodulatory properties, has a profound
effect on human triglyceride regulation . Investigations of the direct effect of
interferon on lipase production, and of cachectin/TNF and other monokines on
lipoproteins in cancer patients, are in progress. These studies should help
delineate the mechanisms by which factors produced by the immune system
modulate the control of lipid metabolism in man.
Summary
Animals suffering from malignancy or chronic infection develop characteristic
metabolic abnormalities, including a well-defined hypertriglyceridemic state.
These abnormalities have been attributed to release of one or more mediators
from activated macrophages. We report that cancer patients receiving RIFN-y,
a potent macrophage activator, at doses of >_0.25 Mg/M2/d i.m. show marked
increases in triglyceride but not in cholesterol levels (pretreatment triglyceride
level of 180 ± 190 mg/dl [mean ± SD] vs. a day-14 level of 370 ± 242 mg/dl, n
= 23, p <0.001 by the paired t test). This hypertriglyceridemia was characterized
by an increase in very low-density lipoproteins and a decrease in plasma post-
heparin lipase activity, consistent with defective triglyceride clearance (mean
pretreatment lipase level of 2.1 umol/ml/h vs. a day-14 level of 1 .2 Amol/ml/h,
n = 6, p = 0.02 by the paired t test). rIFN-y did not directly inhibit lipoprotein
lipase enzymatic activity in vitro. Other possible mechanisms of action, such as
suppression of lipase by an rIFN-y-induced mediator released from activated
macrophages, or a direct effect of interferon on lipase biosynthesis, require
further investigation. Our observations provide evidence that factors produced
by the immune system can regulate lipid metabolism in man.
Note added in proof Recent work by Patton et al. (41) showing that rIFN-y can suppress LPL in
3T3 L1 adipocytes suggests that direct inhibition oflipase production by IFN could be the mechanism
resulting in hypertriglyceridemia.
