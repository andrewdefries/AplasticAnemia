Current knowledge indicates that environ-
mental factors may affect health. Much of
this knowledge is derived from studies of
environmental epidemiology, where a key
point is the link between human exposure to
environmental hazards and health outcome.
In many cases, however, it is difﬁcult to iden-
tify and assess the environment–health links.
One reason is that many environmental fac-
tors act simultaneously and many diseases
have multiple causes, including nonenviron-
mental factors (Bertollini et al. 1996; EEA
1999; WHO 1983). Another reason is the
lack of information on dose–response rela-
tionships for many environmental pollutants.
Moreover, assessment of environmental
impact on health requires quantitative data
on exposure levels and their distribution in
the study area; however, such data are often
unavailable or insufﬁcient. Existing monitor-
ing data usually provide information on only
a limited number of environmental pollutants
in small areas.
Despite these difﬁculties, methods for ana-
lyzing environmental health problems in cont-
aminated areas have been developed in recent
years. The key objective of these research ini-
tiatives is to provide tools to create appropri-
ate environmental health policies. One
method uses environmental health indicators
(EHIs) as measures for expressing the link
between the environment and health; these
indicators are presented in a form facilitating
their interpretation for effective decision-
making (Corvalán et al. 1996). The World
Health Organization (WHO) has played a
major role in developing and using EHIs
(Corvalán et al. 1996). The development and
use of EHIs was an integral element of the
Health and Environment Analysis for
Decision-Making (HEADLAMP) collabora-
tive project among the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP), the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
and the WHO. The goal of HEADLAMP
was to provide information on the health
impacts of environmental hazards for policy-
making and for addressing environmental
health problems (Corvalán 1996; Corvalán
and Kiellström 1995).
To support the development of EHIs,
the WHO provided a conceptual framework,
driving force–pressure–state-exposure–
effect–action (DPSEEA), which adopted the
simple pressure-state-response (PSR)
sequence applied by the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) for environmental reporting (Briggs
and Wills 1999; Corvalán et al. 1996). The
DPSEEA framework illustrates a chain of
causes and effects. In the acronym, driving
forces (D) refer to the factors that motivate
and push environmental processes, including
population growth, economic development,
or technologic development. Pressure (P) is
expressed by human occupation, production,
or waste release. State of the environment (S)
is expressed in terms of frequency or magni-
tude of natural hazards, the availability and
quality of natural resources, and the level of
environmental pollution. Exposure (E) refers
to the intersection between people and envi-
ronmental hazards. Effects (E) of exposure to
environmental hazards may include a broad
spectrum, from subclinical effects to illness
or, in extreme cases, mortality. Within
DPSEEA, action (A) may be taken at each
point of the environment–health chain and
may be protective, remedial, or preventive
(Briggs and Wills 1999; Corvalán et al.
1996).
EHIs may include both environmental
indicators and health indicators for which the
relationship between human exposure to
environmental hazards and health effects is
known (Corvalán et al. 1996; Corvalán and
Kiellström 1995). Wills and Briggs (1995)
defined two categories of EHIs: a) health-
related environmental indicators (HREIs) are
environmental conditions or trends that may
cause potential adverse health effects, and b)
environmental-related health indicators
(ERHIs) are health outcomes due to environ-
mental causes or factors.
According to the concept of the DPSEEA
framework, the most effective HREIs should
express exposure levels. However, due to a
lack of relevant data, environmental indica-
tors that express exposure levels indirectly
(e.g., air pollution concentrations or emission
rates) are most frequently used in environ-
mental hazard assessments. A survey of pro-
jects performed from 1970 to 1990 indicated
that only 1% of all indicators (2 of 233 ana-
lyzed) related speciﬁcally to exposure, whereas
33% of indicators characterized source activ-
ity. Eight percent related to emissions, and

Using an indicator-based approach, we assessed environmental hazards and related health effects
in populations of industrial cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants in Upper Silesia, Poland,
and analyzed the relationship between environment and health. We adopted the method devel-
oped by Dutkiewicz et al. for assessing large geographic areas. Based on routinely collected envi-
ronmental and health data, two groups of indicators, environmental indicators (EIs) and health
status indicators (HSIs), related to environmental contamination were selected. The EI and HSI
values were normalized and aggregated into synthetic measures using Strahl’s taxonometric
method. The synthetic measures indicated the intensity of environmental hazards and health out-
comes. We used a three-level index scale to compare and rank the cities under the study and, con-
sequently, to facilitate decision making. Findings of the assessment identiﬁed cities where actions
aimed at reducing environmental hazards and improving population health status should be estab-
lished as priorities. These cities included Chorzów, Katowice, Sosnowiec, Bytom, and Zabrze. We
found a high correlation between the synthetic measures of environmental indicators and the syn-
thetic measure of health status indicators (r = 0.77), as well as a high level of consistency between
environmental hazard indices and environmental-related health status indices (73%). This may
indicate the existence of a causal relationship between the environmental contamination within
industrial cities and the health status of their inhabitants. Key words: environmental hazards, envi-
ronmental indicators, environment-related health status indicators, industrial cities, synthetic

12% to contaminant concentrations. Forty-
ﬁve percent of indicators related to nonenvi-
ronmental issues (Wills and Briggs 1995).
In turn, health indicators should describe
health outcomes caused by exposure to envi-
ronmental hazards, when used for estimating
health impact of environmental contamina-
tion (Corvalán et al. 1996). However, conta-
mination of industrial areas with numerous
toxic substances leads to combined exposure
that results in nonspecific, aggregated, and
varied health effects. To determine which
health effects are environmentally related (e.g.,
infant mortality, mortality from diseases of the
respiratory system), a relative risk assessment
method may be applied (Dutkiewicz et al.
1996b, 1997, 1998).
To assess environmental hazards and
related health effects in a given area, it may
be necessary to use many individual environ-
mental and/or health indicators. This could
cause difﬁculties in interpreting the results of
such an assessment and therefore may pre-
vent decision makers from taking appropriate
action related to environmental health pro-
tection. The use of composite indicators,
which integrate individual indicators to a
synthetic measure or an index, could simplify
the complexity of environmental and health
phenomena and consequently facilitate the
decision-making process (Corvalán et al.
1996).
Aim of the Study
Research initiatives to develop composite
environmental indicators and related health
indicators have been undertaken in Poland in
recent years (Dutkiewicz 1994; Dutkiewicz
et al. 1996b, 1997, 1998; Mazurski 1994).
However, these indicators related only to
large geographic areas. Thus, a research gap
has been observed for smaller areas, such as
the lowest administrative units. Because of
the complexity of environmental contamina-
tion, as well as the percentage of the popula-
tion exposed to high levels of chemical
contamination, the importance of such
research has been particularly realized within
industrial cities. To fulﬁl this gap, we under-
took this study aimed at comprehensively
assessing environmental hazards in Polish
industrial cities and health outcome.
We identified potentially health-related
environmental indicators and health status
indicators, related to environmental contami-
nation, which were then used as synthetic mea-
sures for assessing, comparing, and ranking the
cities under the study. Consequently, these
measures may serve as a basis for establishing
environmental health policies and priorities.
Description of the Study Area
For the study area, industrial cities of Upper
Silesia, Poland, that are inhabited by more
than 100,000 people were chosen. They
included Katowice, Bytom, Chorzów,
Dabrowa Górnicza, Gliwice, Ruda Slaska,
Sosnowiec, Zabrze, Jastrzebie-Zdrój, Rybnik,
and Tychy.
Upper Silesia is a typical industrial region,
with high levels of urbanization and high
population density. The main types of indus-
try include coal mining, power generation,
iron and steel metallurgy, and nonferrous
metal processing and mining (including zinc
and lead ores and chemical and building
material production). In 1995, 245 industrial
plants were recognized as especially contribut-
ing to the poor air quality; 108 of these were
located in cities inhabited by more than
100,000 people (US 1996). Exploitation of
mineral resources and industrial activities
resulted in high levels of air pollution, soil
and surface water contamination, and accu-
mulation of industrial wastes (Marchwinska
et al. 1997; PIOS 1997; US 1996).
Within this region, two ecologic hazard
areas (EHAs) were identified in the 1980s:
the Upper Silesian Ecological Hazard Area
and the Rybnik Ecological Hazard Area.
These EHAs were recognized as areas of eco-
logic disaster (Kassenberg and Rolewicz
1985). In various classifications of EHAs
where environmental contamination or
degradation were taken into consideration,
the Upper Silesian Ecological Hazard Area
was most often ranked the highest among
EHAs in Poland (Dutkiewicz 1994; Godzik
and Poborski 1995; Kassenberg and Rolewicz
1985; Konczalik 1997).
Studies conducted in Upper Silesia
demonstrated that the areas of highest air and
soil pollution correspond with the highest
infant mortality rates and incidence of respi-
ratory system diseases in children (Norska-
Borówka et al. 1990). Moreover, the range of
excess mortality due to air pollution with res-
pirable dust was estimated at 5–23% in
Silesian cities comparing to cities in
OECD countries (Herzman et al. 1995).
Another study found that elevated blood
lead levels (≥ 15 µg/dL) may be expected in
10,000–18,000 preschool children living in
industrial towns of this region (Zejda et al.
1996). The studies also revealed that the occur-
rence of elevated blood lead levels was associated
with the place of residence and the intensity of
vehicular trafﬁc (Zejda et al. 1996, 1997).
Infant mortality rate is higher in urban
than in nonurban areas of Upper Silesia.
Since the 1970s, the infant mortality rate (per
1,000 live births) has been higher each year in
this region than in the entire country: In
1995, infant mortality was 13.6 in Poland
versus 14.0 in Upper Silesia (WZMOZ
1997).
In Upper Silesia, the main causes of death
are diseases of the circulatory system and
malignant neoplasms. In 1995, comparing all
regions of the country, the highest acute
myocardial infarction mortality rate (per
100,000 people) was noted in Upper Silesia:
119.2, versus 74.7 in the entire country
(WZMOZ 1997). Given the data from all
administrative units of Upper Silesia, from
1985 to 1993, the highest age-standardized
malignant neoplasms incidence and mortality
rates were observed in the towns of this
region, both for males and females (Zemla et
al. 1999).
Because of signiﬁcant environmental cont-
amination with chemical substances as well as
many adverse health effects observed in the
inhabitants of Upper Silesia, remedial environ-
mental activities in this region should be inten-
siﬁed, especially in the areas of industrial cities.
Methods
To assess environmental hazards and related
health impacts in the study cities, we adopted
the method recently developed by Dutkiewicz
et al. (1996a, 1997, 1998) for assessing large
geographic areas. This method uses two
groups of indicators: environmental indica-
tors (EIs) and health status indicators (HSIs),
which are selected based on routinely col-
lected environmental and health data. The
values of the selected EIs and HSIs were nor-
malized and aggregated into synthetic mea-
sures that allowed a complex assessment and
ranking of studied areas.
Generally, the methodology encompasses
the following main steps: selection of EIs and
HSIs; construction of synthetic measures of
EIs and HSIs; and division of each set of syn-
thetic measures into groups using a three-
level index scale. This approach employs two
distinct methodologies: a relative risk method
for selection of HSIs and a taxonometric
method for synthetic measures construction.
Selection of EIs. In these studies, the
selection of EIs followed analysis of environ-
mental statistics and monitoring data from
1995, as published in national or regional
environmental reports (Cimander et al. 1996;
GUS 1996a, 1996b; Korzuch 1997; Terelak
et al. 1994; US 1996). The analysis focused
on these environmental data, which represent
chemical hazards with the potential to pose
health risks and was available in the same
form for all cities with more than 100,000
inhabitants. Because data were lacking on
exposure levels of specific groups of people,
only environmental data that expressed indi-
rectly the level of exposure (e.g., air pollution
concentrations or accumulated industrial
wastes) could be considered potential indica-
tors. This information was related to a strictly
deﬁned city area, thereby indicating the num-
ber of potentially exposed people. In fact, the
levels of environmental hazards are differenti-
ated within the city area, and consequently

cases of extremely low and high exposure to
harmful substances occur. However, because
more detailed data were not available, average
values of environmental indicators were used
to show average exposure of the entire popu-
lation of a given city.
As a result of this analysis, the following
EIs were selected:
• Air pollution indicator (API): aggregate
indicator, deﬁned as the sum of quotients of
average concentrations of basic air pollutants
(i.e., suspended particulate matter [SPM],
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and
National Ambient Air Quality Standards
[NAAQS] for these pollutants)
• Soil contamination indicator (SCI): expresses
(as a percentage) the level and extent of
arable soil contamination for heavy metals in
a given city area
• Accumulated industrial wastes indicator
(AWI): provides the quantity of accumu-
lated industrial wastes, per city area unit
• Indicator of untreated wastewater discharge
to surface waters (WDI): expresses the vol-
ume of untreated wastewater discharged to
surface water, per city area unit.
Selection of HSIs. HSIs were selected
using a two-step procedure. The initial step
involved identifying health status indicators
related to environmental contamination. This
pre-selection was carried out based on a sur-
vey of literature concerning human health
effects of environmental contamination
(Berciano et al. 1989; Biesiada et al. 1997;
Bobak and Leon 1992; Derrienic et al. 1989;

or mortality from diseases of the respiratory
system (Berciano et al. 1989; Derrienic et al.
1989; Dockery and Pope 1997; Dockery et
al. 1989; Jedrychowski 1995; Krzyzanowski

from cancer (Dockery et al. 1993; Doll and
Peto 1981; Ford and Bialik 1980;
Jedrychowski et al. 1990; Zemla et al. 1999),
infant mortality (Biesiada et al. 1997; Bobak
and Leon 1992; Norska-Borówka 1995;
Norska-Borówka et al. 1990, 1995; Osuch-
Jaczewska and Baczynska-Szymocha 1992),
and low birth weight or birth defects
(Biesiada et al. 1997; Grazuleviciene 1997;
Norska-Borówka 1997).
Also, ﬁndings of previous studies carried
out in large geographic areas of Poland
(Dutkiewicz et al. 1997), and data on the
most frequent mortality causes in Upper
Silesia (WZMOZ 1997; Zemla et al. 1999)
were taken account in the pre-selection
process. Moreover, a list of sentinel health
events (SHEs), identified as indicators of
undue exposure to environmental contamina-
tion (Rothwell et al. 1991), was considered
essential for selecting HSIs.
SHEs include diseases identifiable
through existing health reporting systems and
deviations from normal biologic function
requiring special surveys to detect (preclinical
indicators of adverse health effect). The indi-
cators of the first category include low birth
weight, birth defects, spontaneous abortion,
chronic respiratory disease in children, active
leukemia in children, acute granulocytic
leukemia in adults, aplastic anemia, asthma in
children, dermatitis and dermatoses, skin can-
cer, malignant melanoma, lung cancer and
bladder cancer in nonsmokers as well as pri-
mary liver cancer in nondrinkers. Deviations
in neurologic, immunologic, renal, cardiac,
hematologic, respiratory, reproductive, liver,
and auditory functions were identified as
indicators of the second category. These
events occur in whole populations; however,
an excess frequency of one of them may serve
as warning signs of population exposure to
environmental contaminants.
As a result of the literature survey, the fol-
lowing HSIs indicators were identified as
potentially environmentally related and
selected for further consideration: general
infant mortality, infant mortality from con-
genital anomalies, infant mortality with low
birth weight (< 2500 g), births with low birth
weight (BLBW), and age-, sex-, and cause-
speciﬁc mortality from diseases of the circula-
tory system [International Classification of
Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death,
9th revision; (ICD-9) 390–459], including
ischemic heart disease (ICD-9 410–414) and
acute myocardial infarction (ICD-9 410);
malignant neoplasms (ICD-9 140–208),
including malignant neoplasms of the stom-
ach (ICD-9 151), colon (ICD-9 153), rec-
tum, rectosigmoid junction, and anus
(ICD-9 154), trachea, bronchus, and lung
(ICD-9 162), female breast (ICD-9 174),
and cervix uteri (180), as well as leukemias
(ICD-9 204–208); diseases of the respiratory
system (ICD-9 460–519), including bronchi-
tis, pulmonary emphysema, and bronchial
asthma (ICD-9 490–493); diseases of the
blood and blood-forming organs (ICD-9
280–289); diseases of the skin and subcuta-
neous tissue (ICD-9 680–709); and congeni-
tal anomalies (ICD-9 740–759).
The second step of the selection process
was based on the concept that environmental
exposures may account for excess adverse
health events in a given area when those
events occur at a higher level than expected in
a population. Therefore, HSIs that are signiﬁ-
cantly higher in cities with the highest EI val-
ues (region A), compared to the reference
cities (region B), would be most appropriate
for assessing health status related to environ-
mental contamination. Thus, by analyzing
EIs previously selected in this study, we estab-
lished the following cities as highly contami-
nated areas (region A): Katowice, Bytom,
Chorzów, Ruda Slaska, Sosnowiec, and
Zabrze. The reference cities were identified
among the least contaminated Polish cities,
located outside of the EHAs. Thus, region B
comprised four cities: Bialystok, Koszalin,
Slupsk, and Olsztyn.
For comparing preselected HSIs in the
cities of region A with region B, we used a rel-
ative risk assessment method (Polz 1996). To
calculate relative risks, we used health data
associated with preselected HSIs, combined
with information on the age and sex structures
of populations in region A and region B in
1995 (as obtained from the Central Statistical
Ofﬁce; Statistical Ofﬁce, Olsztyn, Poland).
To identify HSIs that were highly related
to environmental contamination, we adopted
the following criteria, also applied in previous
studies (Dutkiewicz et al. 1997, 1998;
Indulski and Andryszek 1995): a relative risk
(RR) > 1.2 (120%), which is an arbitrary cri-
terion, and a lower conﬁdence limit (LCL) > 1
(100%), with a signiﬁcance level of α = 0.05.
As a result of this ﬁnal selection, four HSIs
were identiﬁed as most closely related to EIs:
mortality of males in the 30–59 age group
from malignant neoplasms (ICD-9 140–208);
mortality of males and females in the 30–59
age group from diseases of the circulatory sys-
tem (ICD-9 390–459); mortality of males and
females from diseases of the respiratory system
(ICD-9 460–519); and BLBW.
To assess the health status of the cities’
populations, we used HSIs in terms of mor-
tality rates (incidences per 100,000 persons)
and percentage of BLBW.
Construction of synthetic measures using
the taxonometric method. To comprehen-
sively assess the environmental hazards and
health status expressed by the indicators, tax-
onometric methods of a comparative multi-
component analysis may be incorporated.
The taxonometric methods allow normaliza-
tion and aggregation of the variables, which
vary with respect to nomenclature and
numeric values, into one synthetic measure
within a deﬁnite numeric interval (Andryszek
1984; Hellwig 1968; Strahl 1978). The tax-
onometric methods were applied to assess the
health situation in the country (Andryszek

1993; Klima and Wydymus 1993), to evalu-
ate the allocation of resources for environ-
mental protection (Andryszek 1984), to
analyze the relationship between mortality
and life expectancy versus socioeconomic sta-
tus in Poland (Kedelski 1983), and to assess
environmental and health hazards in large
geographic areas (Dutkiewicz et al. 1996a,
1997, 1998).
In this study, the selected EIs and HSIs
were normalized and aggregated into syn-
thetic measures using Strahl’s taxonometric
method (Strahl 1978), as applied in previous
studies (Dutkiewicz et al. 1996a; 1996b;
1997; 1998; Indulski and Andryszek 1995).
The synthetic measure (Si) is the arithmetic
mean of the normalized indicators:
where Yij = value of the jth indicator in the
ith city area; Yijnorm = normalized value of
the jth indicator in the ith city area; minYij =
minimum value of the jth indicator in the ith
city area; and m = number of indicators.
In this method, both the normalized
values of the indicators and the values of the
synthetic measures are within the range
0–1. The synthetic measures indicate the
intensity of environmental hazards and
health effects in the cities under study. The
lowest value of the synthetic measure repre-
sents the worst environmental or health sit-
uation in a given city, and the highest value
of the synthetic measure represents the best
situation.
Indexing method. To make the findings
of the assessment of environmental hazards in
the cities and health status more simpliﬁed in
terms of decision making, each set of the syn-
thetic measures was expressed by indices in a
three-level scale based on the method applied
for the assessment of regional environmental
and health hazards in Poland (Dutkiewicz et
al. 1996a, 1997, 1998).
Thus, the synthetic measures were
divided into three groups, to which index val-
ues were attributed, as follows:
Si > exp(Ai + 1/2 SDi) Index 1
exp(Ai – 1/2 SDi) ≤ Si ≤ exp(Ai + 1/2 SDi)
Index 2
Si < exp(Ai – 1/2 SDi) Index 3
where Si = synthetic measure; Ai = arithmetic
mean of natural logarithmic values of syn-
thetic measures; SDi = standard deviation for
natural logarithmic values of synthetic mea-
sures; and exp = exponential function.
The index values were described as fol-
lows: index 1—low environmental hazards in
a given city or the best environmental-related
health status of inhabitants; index 2—
medium environmental hazards or moderately
good environmental-related health status, and
index 3—high environmental hazards or the
worst environmental-related health status.
Results
According to Strahl’s method for normaliza-
tion and aggregation of variables (Strahl
1978), we used four EIs to calculate the syn-
thetic measures of environmental indicators
(SE), and four HSIs to calculate the synthetic
measures of health status indicators (SH) for

the cities of Upper Silesia and the reference
cities. Table 1 presents the real and normal-
ized values of EIs, as well as SE. Table 2
shows real and normalized values of HSIs, as
well as SH.
Each of the studied cities was also classi-
ﬁed into one of three index groups associated
with environmental hazards and related
health status, which allowed comparison and
ranking of cities (Table 3). Chorzów, Bytom,
Katowice, Dabrowa Górnicza, Ruda Slaska,
Zabrze, and Sosnowiec were classiﬁed as cities
with high environmental hazards (index 3).
Gliwice, Jastrzebie Zdrój, Tychy, and Rybnik
were classified as cities of medium environ-
mental hazards (index 2). No city of Upper
Silesia met the index value of 1 for low envi-
ronmental hazards. The worst environmental-
related health status (index 3) was noted in
Chorzów, Katowice, Sosnowiec, Bytom, and
Zabrze. In the cities of Ruda Slaska, Tychy,
Dabrowa Górnicza, Jastrzebie Zdrój, and
Gliwice, the environmental-related health sta-
tus was moderately good (index 2). Among
Upper Silesian cities, only Rybnik was classi-
ﬁed as a city of the best environmental-related
health status (index 1). Chorzów was classi-
fied as a city of the highest environmental
hazards and, at the same time, of the worst
environmental-related health status.
Based on the classification of cities pre-
sented in Table 3, the consistency level
between environmental hazard indices and
environmental-related health status indices
was also evaluated. Among 15 cities, 11 cities
had the same index values for environmental
hazards and health status: index 1—Olsztyn,
Bialystok, Koszalin; index 2—Gliwice,
Jastrzebie Zdrój, Tychy; index 3—Chorzów,
Katowice, Bytom, Sosnowiec, Zabrze.
Thus, a high consistency level (73%)
between environmental hazard indices and
environmental-related health status indices
was found.
Moreover, during the course of the study,
we evaluated the correlation between SE and
SH (Figure 1). The correlation coefﬁcient, r =
0.77, was statistically significant, with a sig-
nificance level of p < 0.05. Using reciprocal
scales, Figure 1 shows that an increase of
environmental contamination (i.e., decrease
of SE values) results in a rapid increase of neg-
ative health status indicators (i.e., decrease of
SH values).
We also evaluated the correlation between
SE and each individual normalized HSI.
Analysis showed that SE was most strongly
correlated with mortality of males and
females from diseases of the respiratory sys-
tem (r = 0.84; p < 0.05) and with mortality of
males and females in the 30–59 age group
from diseases of the circulatory system (r =
0.65; p < 0.05). Lower correlation was
observed for mortality of males in the 30–59
age group from malignant neoplasms (r =
0.56; p < 0.05). Correlation between SE and
percentage of BLBW was the lowest (r = 0.39)
and statistically insigniﬁcant at p < 0.05.
Discussion
This study was based on the DPSEEA con-
ceptual framework for the development of
environmental health indicators and guide-
lines of the HEADLAMP project (Corvalán
1996; Corvalán et al. 1996; Corvalán and
Kjellström 1995; Kjellström and Corvalán
1995) and was aimed at providing informa-
tion on the local environmental health prob-
lems in a form usable for decision makers,
scientists, and communities. The study also
represents a continuation of the research on
the development and use of EHIs which have
been performed in Poland over recent years
(Dutkiewicz 1994; Dutkiewicz et al. 1996a,
1996b, 1997, 1998).
The method used for assessment of environ-
mental hazards and health outcome in industrial
cities is based on environmental–health relation-
ships, as well as a proper selection of two groups
of indicators, EIs and HSIs. The selection of
these indicators was based on environmental
and health data routinely collected at urban
administrative units, which is a main charac-
teristic of HEADLAMP (Corvalán and
Kjellström 1995), as well as the method of
assessment for large geographic areas in
Poland (Dutkiewicz et al. 1996a, 1996b,
1997, 1998). Among four selected EIs (API,
SCI, AWI, and WDI), API and WDI were
also taken into account in the assessment of
large geographic areas (Dutkiewicz et al.
1997). Four HSIs, established as a result of
the relative risk assessment, may point to the
existence of cause–effect relationships
between environmental hazards in the cities
and the health status of their inhabitants.
Thus, it may be concluded that environ-
mental contamination in industrial cities
affects especially the mortality of males in the
30–59 age group due to malignant neoplasms
(ICD-9 140–208), the mortality of males and
females in the 30–59 age group due to dis-
eases of the circulatory system (ICD-9
390–459), the mortality of males and females
due to diseases of the respiratory system
(ICD-9 460–519), and the percentage of
BLBW. It should be also noted that two of
the four selected HSIs, mortality of males and
females in the 30–59 age group from diseases
of the circulatory system and percentage of
BLBW, were also selected as useful indicators
for environmental-related health status assess-
ment in large geographic areas (Dutkiewicz et
al. 1997). Signiﬁcant differences in mortality
from diseases of the respiratory and circulatory
systems, as well as from neoplasms, between
cities of high environmental hazards and refer-
ence cities were also observed by Witkowski
(1990). This confirms that HSIs were prop-
erly selected in our own study and may be
considered as the most essential HSIs related
to environmental contamination in the cities.
Among preselected HSIs concerning
infants, percentage of BLBW was the only
indicator that met both criteria of selection
(i.e., RR > 1 and LCL > 1). These criteria were
not met for infant mortality, infant mortality
from congenital anomalies, and mortality of
infants with low birth weight. In addition to
the percentage of BLBW, mortality of infants

with low birth weight also met the same crite-
ria in previous studies (Dutkiewicz et al.
1997).
The selected EIs and HSIs refer to pres-
sure, state, and effect components of the
DPSEEA chain, respectively. Because of the
scarcity of appropriate data on levels of expo-
sure to toxic substances, the EIs selected in
this study characterize exposure indirectly.
Indirect indicators were also applied as a
proxy for exposure for assessing large geo-
graphic areas in Poland (Dutkiewicz et al.
1996a, 1996b, 1997, 1998; Indulski and
Andruszek 1995) as well as in projects per-
formed in other countries (Wills and Briggs
1995). Thus, in this study, proxy EIs derived
from higher up the DPSEEA cause–effect
chain (i.e., pressure and state) are most useful
for environmental health managers in terms
of taking preventive actions to eliminate or
reduce environmental hazards. This may be
considered the most effective long-term
approach.
Providing information on environmental
hazards and health outcomes in a form easy
to interpret and thus useful for decision mak-
ers required integrating selected indicators.
For that purpose, taxonometric methods
seem useful. The normalization and aggrega-
tion of indicators with taxonometric methods
yield synthetic measures (Andryszek 1984;
Hellwig 1968; Strahl 1978) that make com-
parative analyses of given areas possible. To
calculate SE and SH in the cities of Upper
Silesia, we chose Strahl’s taxonometric
method (Strahl 1978). This study proved that
Strahl’s method, successfully applied in previ-
ous studies for assessment of environmental
hazards and health status in large geographic
areas (Dutkiewicz et al. 1996a, 1996b, 1997,
1998; Indulski and Andryszek 1995), is also
fully useful in smaller administrative units.
The synthetic measures indicated the
intensity of environmental hazards and health
effects, which were next expressed by indices
in a three-level scale. Each of the studied
cities could be classiﬁed into one of the three
index groups (Table 3). Because only the
average values of EIs could be used to reﬂect
exposure of inhabitants, the applied classiﬁca-
tion method has deterministic character.
Such a classification method was projected
arbitrarily to serve for speciﬁc purposes (i.e.,
for categorizing and comparing Silesian cities
with reference cities) and consequently to
serve as a basis for establishing regional envi-
ronmental health policies and priorities. The
indices facilitated comparison and ranking of
the cities under study and made the ranking
outcomes more understandable, as well as
more applicable for decision-making and
actions aimed at mitigation of environmental
impact on human health.
In cities characterized by index values of 3
for both environmental hazards and health
status (Chorzów, Katowice, Sosnowiec,
Bytom, and Zabrze), as presented in Table 3,
actions aimed at reducing environmental haz-
ards and protecting health should be priori-
ties. Further, it is advisable to undertake
detailed studies that would identify high-risk
subpopulations in these cities.
Next, to improve health status, actions
aimed at reducing environmental hazards
should also be taken in Gliwice, Jastrzebie
Zdroj, and Tychy. These cities were classiﬁed
as having medium environmental hazards
(index 2) and at the same time as having
moderately good environmental-related
health status (index 2; Table 3).
As for Dabrowa Gornicza, Ruda Slaska,
and Rybnik, lower index values for health sta-
tus (compared to the index for environmental
hazards) were observed and may indicate that
other factors positively inﬂuence health situa-
tion in these cities (e.g., better medical care or
socioeconomic status). Further investigations
should be taken to identify these factors.
The synthetic measures were used not
only for the purpose of comprehensively
assessing the cities, but also for analyzing the
relationship between extent of environmental
hazards and health status (Figure 1). Although
the statistical findings cannot be the only
argument for such relations, a high correlation
between SE and SH (r = 0.77) may indicate
that EIs and HSIs were selected properly and
that a logical cause–effect relationship exists
between environmental contamination within
industrial cities and the health status of inhab-
itants. This correlation is higher than that
found for large urban regions (r = 0.58)
(Dutkiewicz et al. 1998). A comparison of
environmental hazard indices with environ-
mental-related health status indices also indi-
cated a higher consistency level in the cities
(73%) than in the large urban regions (65%)
(Dutkiewicz et al. 1997). These ﬁndings may
suggest that in the cities of Upper Silesia,
where high levels of environmental contami-
nation occur, environment–health relation-
ships are much stronger than in other areas of
Poland and therefore easier to identify and
assess. The possibility of more precise and
accurate identification and selection of EIs
and HSIs at the local level may also contribute
to the higher correlation between their syn-
thetic measures in the cities’ areas.
Correlation analyses showed that, of the
four selected HSIs, only the percentage of
BLBW was low correlated with SE (r = 0.39)
and not statistically signiﬁcantly at p < 0.05.
However, due to the results of the relative
risk assessment, this HSI was included for
construction of SH because statistical correla-
tion does not absolutely prove relationships
between environmental contamination and
health effects. The level of complex urban
environmental hazards expressed as SE
appeared to be much more strongly associ-
ated with mortality from diseases of respira-
tory system, circulatory system and malignant
neoplasm (r = 0.84, 0.65, 0.56, respectively).
It should be mentioned that environmen-
tal contamination is one of risk factors affect-
ing human health, such as lifestyle, diet,
genetic predisposition, access to medical care,
socioeconomic status, and occupational haz-
ards (Bertollini 1996; EEA 1999; Kirschner
1995; Polz 1996). The results of this study
show, however, that environmental contami-
nation may play an important role in deterio-
ration of the health status of populations in
industrial cities. Nevertheless, it is impossible

to quantify the contribution of environmental
contamination to the health status of inhabi-
tants without analyzing other risk factors.
In summary, it should be emphasized that
this comprehensive assessment of environ-
mental hazards and health status, providing
such synthetic ﬁndings, might serve as a basis
for setting environmental health policies in
industrial cities of Upper Silesia. The results
of this study may also help to identify the
need for further environmental health
research in industrial areas.
In future studies, questions of differentia-
tion of exposure levels to environmental haz-
ards in the city areas should be undertaken.
They should especially concern cities classi-
ﬁed as cities of the highest level of these haz-
ards. To make evaluation of health effects
more effective, the investigations should iden-
tify hot spots and use information on expo-
sure levels of pollutants. However, such
studies would require using methods different
from those applied in this study.
