Abstract
T cell depleting strategies are an integral part of immunosuppressive regimens widely used in the hematological and solid
organ transplant setting. Although it is known to induce lymphocytopenia, little is known about the effects of the
polyclonal rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) or the monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab on Natural Killer (NK)
cells in detail. Here, we demonstrate that induction therapy with rATG following kidney/pancreas transplantation results in a
rapid depletion of NK cells. Treatment of NK cells with rATG and alemtuzumab in vitro leads to impairment of cytotoxicity
and induction of apoptosis even at a 10-fold lower concentration (0.1 mg/ml) compared with T and B cells. By generating Fc-
parts of rATG and alemtuzumab we illustrate that their ligation to FccRIII (CD16) is sufficient for the significant induction of
degranulation, apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine release (FasL, TNFa and IFNc) exclusively in CD32
CD56dim
NK cells
whereas application of rATG and alemtuzumab F(ab) fragments abolishes these effects. These findings are of general
importance as our data suggest that NK cells are also mediators of the clinically relevant cytokine release syndrome and that
their targeting by therapeutic antibodies should be considered as they are functionally relevant for the effective clearance
of opportunistic viral infections and anti-tumor activity posttransplantation.

Introduction
Antibodies raised against certain T cell antigens are increasingly
used in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplan-
tation (HSCT) or solid organ transplantation (SOT) in order to
prevent acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or acute steroid-
resistant graft rejection [1]. The polyclonal antithymocyte
globulin (ATG) is a mixture of purified immunoglobulins M
(IgM) and G (IgG) of sera derived from rabbits, horses, or goats
immunized with human thymocytes or T cell lines. The most
widely used preparations include rabbit ATG (rATG, IgG) which
contains antibodies directed against a wide array of antigens
involved in the immune response. These comprise selectin and
integrin family members or immunoglobulin superfamily mole-
cules expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes. Other cell types
such as endothelial or B cells are also recognized by rATG due to
shared epitopes with T cells [2,3]. However, the key mechanism
of rATG action is T cell depletion [4,5], as it has been shown that
CD3+
cell counts are lowered for years in patients treated with
rATG [6–8]. Additionally, rather than T cell depletion as one of
the key mechanisms, rATG has been demonstrated to affect
dendritic cells [9] or to induce regulatory T cells in vitro and in
vivo [10–12].
Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H), a fully humanized CD52-
specific monoclonal antibody which profoundly depletes T, B
and dendritic cells [13,14], is also increasingly used as an
immunosuppressive agent in solid organ transplantation, partic-
ularly in the setting of maintenance immunosuppression
minimization protocols [15–17]. Additionally this monoclonal
antibody has been demonstrated to be beneficial in the treatment
of lymphoid malignancies and autoimmune diseases [18,19].
However, despite the frequent use of rATG or alemtuzumab in
clinical transplantation and extensive knowledge about the effects
on T cells, only limited information is available about the
influence of these therapeutic antibodies on Natural Killer (NK)
cells. NK cells, which are part of the innate immune system,
rapidly kill a wide range of hazardous pathogens such as viruses,
bacteria, and parasites. They are able to kill a variety of tumor
cells without prior sensitization and, through secretion of
cytokines, NK cells are involved in the regulation of T and B
cell-mediated immune response. In general, the lytic activity of
NK cells is controlled by different activating NK receptors such
as NKG2D and the natural cytotoxic receptors (collectively
named NCRs, including NKp46, NKp44 and NKp30) [20]. NK
cells were further shown to mediate antibody-dependent
cytotoxicity (ADCC) through the FccRIII (CD16) receptor,
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 3 | e4709
since anti-CD16 antibodies were able to inhibit ADCC and
immune complex binding [21].
In recent years it has been shown that NK cell alloreactivity is
beneficial following allo-HSCT because it mediates a graft-versus-
leukemia (GvL) effect, eliminating residual malignant cells,
removing host antigen-presenting cells (thereby reducing GvHD),
and mediating immunity to viral pathogens directly through the
cytolysis of virally infected tissues or indirectly by elaborating
inflammatory cytokines, such as interferons (IFNs) [22,23]. The
antiviral capacity of NK cells is even more important, as Epstein–
Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CBV) infections, for
example, are frequent complications of prolonged immune
deficiency [24,25]. In this context, both rATG and alemtuzumab
have been suggested to be associated with an elevated incidence of
EBV/CMV reactivation and disease [26,27]. In general, the
influence of different immunosuppressive drugs on NK cell
function is of particular interest as it has recently been
demonstrated that steroids and calcineurin inhibitors limit the
function of IL-2-activated NK cells [28,29].
Given that both rATG and alemtuzumab mediate multiple
immunomodulatory mechanisms in vitro and in vivo [9,30–32] we
sought to extend these studies by investigating the effects of these
antibodies on NK cells. In summary, we demonstrated that both
rATG and alemtuzumab induce rapid apoptosis in NK cells and a
strong induction of inflammatory cytokines, which is exclusively
mediated via the binding of the IgG1 Fc-part to the low-affinity
receptor for IgG, CD16 (FccRIII).
Materials and Methods
Patients
Between October 2007 and May 2008 eight simultaneous
renal/pancreas patients received a non-HLA-identical allograft
from deceased donors at the Departments of Surgery and
Nephrology, Virchow-Clinic, Universita¨tsmedizin Charite´, Ber-
lin. Transplant patients received initially 1.5 mg/kg body weight
i.v. Thymoglobulin (Genzyme GmbH, Neu Isenburg, Germany)
starting at day 0 followed by 4 further consecutive days in
combination with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and
steroids. Nine patients receiving renal allografts served as
controls. These patients received two dosages of basiliximab
(20 mg i.v. 2 hours before reperfusion an on day 4) which has
been implemented as standard therapy in our clinic for
prophylaxis of rejection as well as maintenance immunosuppres-
sion consisting of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and
prednisone. Blood drug concentrations of tacrolimus ranged
between 8 and 10 ng/ml in both groups. All experiments using
human material were approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Charite´-Universita¨tsmedizin Berlin and all patients agreed to
participate and signed an informed consent. Patient demograph-
ics are summarized in Table 1.
Enrichment of NK cells and cell culture conditions
Peripheral blood from transplant patients was collected
pretransplant and three times/week/patient during hospitaliza-
tion. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated
using ficoll density centrifugation with Bicoll Separating Solution
(Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). For NK cell enrichment PBMCs
were isolated from de-identified healthy donor buffy coats using
ficoll density centrifugation with Bicoll Separating Solution
(Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and NK cells were obtained by
negative purification using the NK Cell Isolation Kit II (Miltenyi
Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the manu-
facturer’s recommendation. The purity of the NK cells
(CD32
CD56+
) was monitored by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) and was more than 95%. Enriched NK cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-
inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% Glutamin and antibiotics
(penicillin 100 U/ml, streptomycin 100 mg/ml) in the presence of
200 IU/ml human recombinant IL-2 (Natutec, Frankfurt am
Main, Germany). NK cell subsets (CD56bright
/CD162
, CD56dim
/
CD16+
) were enriched by flow cytometry (FACSAria, BD
Biosciences), giving a purity of .99%. Rabbit ATG (Thymoglo-
bulin, Genzyme, Neu Isenburg, Germany) was dissolved in sterile
distilled water at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Alemtuzumab
(Campath-1H, MedacSchering, Mu¨nchen, Germany) was deliv-
ered in a solution of 30 mg/ml. The monoclonal anti-CD3
antibody (Orthoclone OKT3, Janssen-Cilag BV, Tilburg, The
Netherlands), the humanized anti-IL2Ra receptor (CD25) anti-
body daclizumab (ZenapaxH; Hoffman La Roche, Basel, Switzer-
land) and a polyclonal rabbit IgG (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.,
Montgomery, Texas, USA) served as controls. Varying concen-
trations of antibodies ranging from 0 to 100 mg/ml were added to
the NK cell cultures for 18 hours or as indicated in the figure
legends. All experiments using human material were approved by
the Ethical Committee of the Charite´-Universita¨tsmedizin
Berlin.
Ex vivo whole blood (WB) assay
Whole blood of volunteer donors was collected into a BD
vacutainer (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA). One ml of fresh whole
blood was co-incubated with 0, 1, 10 and 50 mg/ml of intact
antibody or Fc-parts of rATG and alemtuzumab for 2 hours at
37uC with 5% CO2. Red blood cells were lysed with lysis buffer
(NH4Cl, 0.155 M; KHC03, 0,01 M; EDTA, 1 mM). Preparation
of mRNA and quantitative real-time RT-PCR for FasL, TNFa,
INFc and HPRT were performed as described below.
Antibodies and reagents
F(ab) fragments and Fc-parts of rATG, alemtuzumab and anti-
CD16 (clone 3G8, a kind gift from Dr. Ofer Mandelboim, The
Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel) were prepared by papain
digestion and purified by exclusion chromatography on protein A

according to standard procedures. NK cells were analyzed by
FACS using the following monoclonal antibodies (mAB): anti-CD3
FITC mAb (clone BW264/56, IgG2a), anti-CD3 PE mAb (clone
BW264/56, IgG2a), anti-CD56 APC mAb (clone AF12-7H3,
mouse IgG1), anti-CD16 PE (clone VEP13, mouse IgM), anti-
CD8 PE (clone BW 135/80, mouse IgG2a), anti-NKp30 PE (clone
AF29-4D12, mouse IgG1), anti-NKp44 PE (clone 2.29, mouse
IgG1), anti-NKp46 PE (clone 9E2, mouse IgG1), anti-NKG2D PE
(clone BAT221, mouse IgG1), anti-KIR3DL1 PE (clone DX9,
mouse IgG1), anti-IFNc FITC (clone 45-15, mouse IgG1)
(Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany); anti-CD3
PeCy5 (clone UCHT1, mouse IgG1) (ImmunoTech, Marseille,
France) and anti-KIR2DL1 FITC (clone 143211, IgG1) (R&D,
Minneapolis, USA). Isotype controls conjugated with FITC, PE,
APC and PeCy5 (Ebioscience, San Diego, USA) were used to
discriminate unspecific binding. 26105
cells were incubated in
PBS supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum (FCS) and stained
with the appropriate antibodies for 30 min at 4uC. For
intracellular IFNc analysis expression, Brefeldin A (Sigma, St.
Louis, USA) was added to the cell culture after 1 hour of
incubation for further 2 hours and cells were surface-stained and
fixed with freshly prepared 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. 0.1%
Saponin (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) was used for permeabilization.
Cells were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCaliburH
interfaced with an Apple PowerMac using Cellquest Pro software.
Cell culture supernatants were analyzed for the concentration of
soluble cytokines TNFa and IFNc by Cytometric Bead Array
System (CBA) from BD (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany)
according to the company’s instructions.
Analysis of apoptosis and necrosis
Apoptosis and necrosis of cells were determined by the 36 kD
phospholipid-binding protein Annexin V FITC and propidium
iodide (PI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi
Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). In brief, cells were
discriminated as intact (Annexin V FITC2/PI2), apoptotic
(Annexin V FITC+/PI2) or necrotic (Annexin V FITC+/PI+).
Cytotoxicity assay
Assessment of the specific NK-cell-mediated killing was
performed using the LIVE/DEAD cell-mediated cytotoxicity kit
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA) with slight modifications. 16106
cells of the human MHC-deficient erythromyeloblastoid leukemia
target cell line K562 (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) were
labeled with 30 nM of the membrane dye DiOC18(3) for 20 min
and were subsequently washed with complete medium twice. A
quantity of 16104
labeled K562 cells were mixed with NK cells in
a 96-well plate at effector-target cell (E/T) ratios of 10:1, 5:1 and
2.5:1 and were incubated for 3 hours. Afterwards propidium
iodide (20 nM) was added to the cells. Samples were stored on ice
until fluorescence measurements were performed. DiOC18(3)
labeled cells were selected according to high FL1 green
fluorescence intensity. Propidium iodide-positive dead target cells
were identified by FL3 fluorescence and analysis was performed by
dot plot. The specific killing percentage was calculated by the
following equation: [% of dead (DiOc18(3)+PI+) target cells/(% of
dead (DiOc18(3)+PI+) target cells+% of live (DiOc18(3)+PI2)
target cells)]6100. The specific killing percentage was normalized
by subtracting the percentage of dead target cells without killing.
Every sample was prepared and analyzed in triplicate.
Degranulation assay
CD107a lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1)
expression was used to measure NK cell degranulation, as
previously described [33]. NK cells were incubated in the absence
or presence of K562 target cells at an E/T ratio of 2:1 for 3 hours.
An anti-CD107a PeCy5 antibody (BD PharmingenTM
, NJ, USA)
was added to the cultures directly and Brefeldin A was added after
1 hour of incubation. Cells were then washed in PBS and stained
with anti-CD56 and anti-CD3 for FACS analysis. The K562
specific NK cell degranulation was determined by subtracting the
percentage of CD107a-positive cells in the cultures without K562
cells from the percentage of CD107a-positive NK cells co-
incubated with K562 cells.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA from cell lysates was isolated using RNeasyH Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Real-time reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for gene expression analysis
of selected candidate genes was performed with the ABI PRISM
7500 Sequence Detection System (TaqManTM
, Applied Biosys-
tems, Darmstadt, Germany). All primers were designed using
Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) and validated at the
Institute of Medical Immunology, Charite´-Universita¨tsmedizin
Berlin (Table S1). In general, amplification primers were designed
to span the exon borders to exclude cross-reactivity with genomic
DNA. The PCR reaction was performed in a final volume of 25 ml
containing 1 ml cDNA, 12.5 ml Master Mix (TaqManTM
Univer-
sal PCR Master Mix, Applied Biosystems), 1 ml fluorogenic
hybridization probe, 6 ml primer mix, and 5.5 ml distilled water.
The amplification took place in a two-step PCR (40 cycles; 15 s
denaturation step at 95uC and 1 min annealing/extension step
at 60uC). Specific gene expression was normalized to the house-
keeping gene hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase
(HPRT) given by the formula 22DCt
. The mean Ct values for
the genes of interest (IFNc, TNFa, FasL) and HPRT were
calculated from double determinations. Samples were considered
negative if the Ct values exceeded 40 cycles.
Statistical analysis
Experimental and patient data are expressed as means6stan-
dard deviation (SD). Statistical analyses were performed with
GraphPad Instat for Windows (version 3.06). One-way ANOVA
was calculated for normally distributed data. Adjustments for
multiple comparisons were done with the Tukey-Kramer Multiple
Comparisons Test. For the statistical analysis of apoptosis and
necrosis, cytotoxicity, degranulation and surface FACS staining
rare data were used. The real-time RT-PCR data were log(10)
transformed to stabilize the variance of the normally distributed
data. Groups with p values less than or equal to 0.05 were
considered to be statistically different.
Results
In vivo depletion of NK cells after ATG induction therapy
following pancreas/kidney transplantation
Patients treated with rATG were found to demonstrate a
significant decrease of CD32
CD56+
NK cells within the
peripheral blood lymphocytes following the first day posttrans-
plantation (13.4610.6% pretransplantation versus 2.062.1% first
day posttransplantation, p,0.01) and this effect is persisting until
day 11. In contrast control patients illustrate nearly none or only a
marginal decrease of NK cells after the application of basiliximab
(Figure 1). Although NK cell numbers did not reach the
pretransplant level at days 20 of observation, frequencies of NK
cells between rATG treated and control patients showed
comparable levels at this time point.

rATG and alemtuzumab recognize the surface antigen
CD16 on NK cells
NK cells derived from CD34+
hematopoietic stem cells undergo
differentiation via NK cell precursors in the bone marrow through
acquisition of functional surface receptors [34]. Therefore, certain
NK cell specific receptors should not be targeted by rATG. As
expected we could not detect any influence of rATG on the surface
expression of the activating cytotoxicity receptors NKp30, NKp44,
NKp46, NKG2D and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors
(KIRs) including KIR2DL1 and KIR3DL1 (data not shown). In
contrast we confirmed previous data illustrating that rATG targets
CD8 and CD16 and this effect was dose-dependent (Figure 2A)
[35]. Targeting of CD16 was observed in the presence of 0.1 mg
rATG (67%610.8% versus 33.6%64.1%, p,0.001), and CD16
was further decreased to 1.2%60.6% at a concentration of 1 mg/
ml rATG. In contrast, targeting of CD8 antigen required higher
concentrations of rATG (e.g. 10 mg, 38.6611.9% versus
9.664.3%, p,0.001). Whereas both rATG and alemtuzumab
resulted in a significant and dose-dependent reduction of CD16
surface expression on CD56+
NK cells at a low dose concentration
of 0.1 mg/ml, no CD16 downmodulation could be observed for
daclizumab, an anti-IL-2Ra (CD25) humanized antibody similar
to alemtuzumab (Figure 2B). In contrast, higher concentrations of
rabbit IgG (rIgG) led to a decrease of CD16 (e.g. 10 mg,
80%66.3% versus 48.4%69.7% and 50 mg/ml 22.1%64.3%,
p,0.001).
Both rATG and alemtuzumab affect effector functions of
peripheral blood CD32
/CD56dim
NK cells
Alemtuzumab is also used as induction therapy in clinical
transplantation, inducing profound and prolonged lymphopenia.
As recent reports suggest that alemtuzumab may enhance
lymphocyte apoptosis in vitro in the absence of complement or
immune effector cells [36], we ascertained its effects on NK cells.
NK cells were isolated from healthy blood donors and cultured in
the presence of human recombinant IL-2 (200 IU/ml) with
increasing concentrations of antibodies overnight (18 hours).
Treatment of NK cells with rATG resulted in a dose-dependent
(0.1–100 mg/ml) decrease of NK cytotoxicity directed against the
target cell line K562, as illustrated in Figure 3A (e.g. 1 mg/ml
rATG resulted in 82.0%68.1% NK cell cytotoxicity versus 100%
cytotoxicity of untreated controls, p,0.001) whereas control rIgG
Figure 1. Induction therapy of rATG in simultaneous kidney/pancreas transplantation results in a significant decrease of NK cells.
Patients (n = 8) initially received 1.5 mg/kg body weight i.v. rATG (Thymoglobulin, Genzyme GmbH, Neu Isenburg, Germany) starting at day 0
followed by 4 further consecutive days posttransplantation in combination with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. We further enrolled
nine patients who received a renal allograft as a control group. Control patients received two dosages of basiliximab (20 mg i.v., day 0 and day 4).

affected NK cytotoxicity at higher concentrations (50 mg/ml rIgG
resulted in 81.1%611.1% versus 100% cytotoxicity of untreated
controls, p,0.05). Co-incubation of NK cells with alemtuzumab
also led to an impairment of cytotoxicity (1 mg/ml alemtuzumab
resulted in 75.9%616.6% versus 100% cytotoxicity of untreated
controls, p,0.01) whereas daclizumab did not (Figure 3A). Based
on their CD56 receptor expression density human NK cells can be
distinguished as CD56dim
or CD56bright
NK cells. In peripheral
blood the majority (.90%) are CD56dim
demonstrating high
expression of FccRIII (CD16), while the remaining 10% are
CD56bright
NK cells characterized by almost no or dim expression
of CD16 [37]. As cytotoxicity was sharply targeted by rATG, we
analyzed the intracellular protein expression of IFNc as an effector
molecule in NK cells after co-incubation with K562 cells and
detected a dose-dependent impairment exclusively in CD56dim
NK cells, whereas no influence was observed in CD56bright
NK
cells (Figure 3B, data not shown). Again, a significant decrease of
IFNc was observed even at a low dose concentration of 0.1 mg/ml
rATG (71.2%635.5% versus 100%, p,0.05) or alemtuzumab
(65.4%610.1% versus 100%, p,0.001). Interestingly, higher
dosages such as 50 mg/ml of rIgG (61.5%63.0% versus 100%,
p,0.001) or daclizumab (64.6%614.5% versus 100%, p,0.01)
further led to decreased IFNc expression (Figure 3B).
When we analyzed the degranulation capacity of NK cells
preincubated with rATG by the measurement of CD107a, a
marker significantly upregulated on the surface of NK cells
following stimulation with MHC-devoid targets, we detected a
significant impairment even at a low concentration of 0.1 mg/ml
rATG, and this was observed exclusively in CD56dim
NK cells
(56.8%611.6% versus 100%, p,0.05, Figure 4A). As was seen

performed by flow cytometry. Values demonstrate results normalized to untreated cells, which were set at 100%. Asterisks (*) indicate values that

with rATG, a significant decrease of degranulation capacity of
CD56dim
NK cells after pre-incubation with alemtuzumab was
detected, even at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml (52.5%67.8%
versus 100%, p,0.001, Figure 4A), in contrast to control
antibodies (rIgG, daclizumab), which exhibit induction of
degranulation at higher concentrations (50 mg/ml–100 mg/ml).
In contrast to rATG, no dose-dependent effect was observed for
alemtuzumab (Figure 4A). Interestingly, both rATG and alemtu-
zumab induced degranulation of NK cells without additional
sensitization by adding K562 cells. In comparison with rATG a
stronger CD107a induction in NK cells with alemtuzumab was
detected (e.g. 0.1 mg/ml alemtuzumab 18.3%66.6% versus

moderate degranulation induction on NK cells (5.3%62.8%
degranulation, 100 mg/ml).
Induction of apoptosis in CD32
/CD56dim
NK cells
It has already been demonstrated that rATG induces apoptosis
in NK cells [30]. We could confirm these observations by showing
that even low concentrations of rATG (0.1 mg/ml) resulted in
enhanced apoptosis and necrosis (30.3610.3, p,0.001, Figure 5A)
and this effect was even more intensified in NK cells compared to
T or B cells. However, higher concentrations of rATG (10–
100 mg/ml) led to an increased rate of apoptosis and necrosis in T
and B cells, whereas the rate of necrosis and apoptosis in NK cells
could not be increased (Figure 5A). Next we investigated the
induction of apoptosis following alemtuzumab pretreatment and
also detected a significant induction of apoptosis comparable to
rATG at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml (42.3616.6, p,0.001,
Figure 5B). Induction of apoptosis was also detected with rIgG at a
concentration of 50 mg/ml. In order to verify the results observed
in the bulk NK cell population we sorted CD56dim
and CD56bright
NK cells with a purity greater than 99% for each cell fraction. By
analyzing FACS sorted CD56dim
and CD56bright
NK cells
separately the main induction of necrosis/apoptosis was observed
in the CD56dim
subset (Figure 5C). Again, an impairment of
CD107a expression was also exclusively confirmed for CD56dim
NK cells.
Induction of FasL, TNFa and IFNc in NK cells after
treatment with rATG and alemtuzumab
The stimulation of CD16 (FccRIII) on NK cells can initiate
autocrine programmed cell death by the up-regulation of, for
example, Fas ligand (FasL) [38]. Whereas freshly isolated NK cells
did not constitutively express FasL mRNA, incubation with rATG
resulted in a rapid and dose-dependent mRNA induction within
the first hour (p,0.001) which decreased after 6 hours of co-
culture (Figure 6A). Furthermore it has been demonstrated that
anti-T-cell therapy results in the cytokine release syndrome early
after administration [39,40]. Similar to the induction of FasL
mRNA, we detected a dose-dependent increase of TNFa and
IFNc mRNA in NK cells within the first hour of co-incubation
with rATG (p,0.001, Figure 6A). Additionally, the same
induction of FasL, TNFa and IFNc mRNA was observed for
alemtuzumab-treated NK cells (p,0.001, respectively), although
the induction of IFNc and TNFa mRNA was more intense
compared to rATG-pretreated NK cells (Figure 6B). Analysis of
the control antibodies rIgG and daclizumab showed that both
induced a cytokine induction at higher concentrations (10–50 mg/
ml), which is clearly below the induction profile of rATG and
alemtuzumab (Figure S1). We confirmed the rapid and significant
induction of TNFa and IFNc at the protein level in cell culture
supernatants (p,0.001, respectively, Figure 6C), further demon-
strating that alemtuzumab resulted in higher cytokine expression
levels compared to rATG.
The Fc-part of rATG and alemtuzumab is sufficient to
induce cytokine release, apoptosis and degranulation via
FccRIII ligation
In order to investigate the influence of the unspecific binding of
the Fc-part to FccRIII, we generated F(ab) fragments and Fc-parts
of a CD16 blocking antibody (clone 3G8), rATG and alemtuzu-
mab. Blocking FccRIII on NK cells by F(ab) fragments of an anti-
CD16 resulted in a significant inhibition of FasL (p,0.001), TNFa
(p,0.05) and IFNc (p,0.001) mRNA induction. Additionally, the
application of F(ab) fragments of either rATG or alemtuzumab
further did not cause FasL, TNFa and IFNc mRNA induction
(Figure S2). Next, we tested generated Fc-parts and could illustrate
that the application of rATG and alemtuzumab Fc-parts only is
sufficient to induce a significant cytokine induction and apoptosis
in NK cells compared with F(ab) fragments. This induction
showed a similar expression level compared with intact IgG
antibodies. In contrast, the application of control rIgG, a
monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3, IgG2a isotype) or
daclizumab (Figure S1, 1 mg/ml for 1 hour) did not lead to
induced cytokine levels and increased apoptosis (Figure 7A,B).
Moreover, CD16 ligation by rATG and alemtuzumab Fc-parts
resulted in degranulation of NK cells further emphasizing that
antigen-specific crosslinking of antibodies is not necessary for the
observed effector effects (Figure 7C). After the addition of rATG
or alemtuzumab F(ab) fragments, targeting of CD16 on
CD56+
CD16+
cells and induction of NK cell apoptosis was
abolished compared to the application of intact IgG antibodies
(p,0.001, Figure 8). Thus, our results clearly illustrate that
FccRIII ligation with the Fc-part of rATG or alemtuzumab is
sufficient to induce NK cell apoptosis and cytokine release and
that this effect is independent of antibody specificity.
In order to ascertain whether high concentrations of serum
immunoglobulins in whole blood may block the Fc-part-mediated
cytokine release of rATG or alemtuzumab, we performed
stimulation experiments in whole blood. Our results with co-
incubation of whole blood with intact antibody or Fc-parts
demonstrate that CD16 ligation is sufficient for TNFa, IFNc and
FasL induction in this experimental setting (Figure 9).
Discussion
Rather than T cell depletion rATG mediates complement-
related lysis or activation-associated apoptosis via the induction of
Fas and FasL [41] and prevention of memory T cell migration
[3,4]. Recent studies illustrate that the therapeutic effect of rATG
might be due to the generation of regulatory T cells and

polarization of monocyte-derived dendritic cells towards tolero-
genic dendritic cells [10,42]. Although alemtuzumab has not been
able to induce allograft tolerance as was initially hoped, it is
assumed that both complement and non-complement-mediated
mechanisms are similarly responsible for alemtuzumab-mediated
killing of T cells. Recent reports suggest that alemtuzumab may
enhance lymphocyte apoptosis in vitro in the absence of
complement or immune effector cells, leading to cell death
through a nonclassical caspase-independent pathway [43]. In
addition it has been reported that alemtuzumab can indeed act
through immunological mechanisms, such as complement-medi-
ated (CDC) and/or ADCC by virtue of its IgG Fc region [44].
Despite the frequent use of rATG or alemtuzumab in clinical
trials, detailed mechanistic studies to elucidate specific killing
pathways in various lymphocyte subsets were still missing.
By analyzing patients after ATG induction therapy, treatment
with rATG was shown to result in a significant decrease of
CD32
CD56+
NK cells within peripheral blood lymphocytes
following the first day posttransplantation. Although it has been
mentioned that NK cell numbers are significantly higher in rATG
treated liver transplanted patients compared with antibody-free
treated patients in the long-term phase [45], our data indicate a
normalization of NK cell frequencies starting at day 11
posttransplantation (Figure 1). In order to ascertain the in vitro
effects on NK cells, we confirmed that surface expression of CD16
and CD8 is affected by low dose concentrations of rATG (0.1 mg/
ml), and a similar observation was made for CD16 after treatment
of NK cells with alemtuzumab (Figure 2A,B). We further showed
that preincubation of rATG and alemtuzumab resulted in
decreased effector mechanisms in NK cells, including cytotoxicity,
degranulation and intracellular IFNc production, exclusively in
CD32
CD56dim
cells (Figure 3A,B, 4A,C). Interestingly both
antibodies led to degranulation of NK cells even in the absence
of a sensitizing target, illustrating that CD56dim
NK cells were
more affected by alemtuzumab than by rATG (Figure 4B,C). Our
results are in contrast of a recent publication [46], describing that
the incubation of PBMCs with 10 mg/ml alemtuzumab without
target cells did not increase CD107a expression. Moreover the
same authors observed enhanced degranulation capacity of NK
cells after the infusion with rituximab (anti-CD20, IgG1) in non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients and attributed the observed anti-
lymphoma effect to ADCC mediated by NK cells.
It has been shown that rATG induces apoptosis and necrosis in
NK cells even at a low dose concentration (0.1 mg/ml) [30]. We
could confirm this observation and further demonstrate that this
induction is exclusively restricted to CD56dim
cells, whereas CD56high
cells remain unaffected. In comparison, an induction of apoptosis in
B cells was observed at 1 mg/ml whereas higher concentrations in T
cells were needed (10 mg/ml) (Figure 5A,B). The induction of
apoptosis in T cells may differ as higher concentrations are necessary
for apoptosis induction in resting T cells [41]. Additionally, the
application of 0.1 mg/ml alemtuzumab also induced apoptosis in NK
cells to a similar extent compared to rATG (p,0.001, respectively,
antibody treated versus control, Figure 5C).

Patients treated with rATG or alemtuzumab may experience
symptoms of cytokine release syndrome, reflected by elevated
serum levels of TNFa, IFNc or IL-6 [47,48]. In the context of
alemtuzumab it was demonstrated more than a decade ago in vitro
that the induced cytokine release appears to be a consequence of
IgG1-dependent CD16 ligation on NK cells [38]. Upon CD16-
mediated activation, NK cells secrete cytokines, mediate ADCC
and may undergo apoptosis as a consequence of FasL-induced cell
death. We could demonstrate a rapid and significant induction of
FasL, TNFa and IFNc mRNA in NK cells within the first hour of
preincubation with rATG and alemtuzumab, which was further
confirmed at the protein level (p,0.001, Figure 6). By incubating
NK cells with F(ab) fragments of these antibodies mRNA cytokine
and apoptosis induction was significantly inhibited (Figure 7A,B).
It has been also reported, that both antibody specificity and the
isotype are responsible for the cytokine release [38]. In contrast to
previous data our results show that the Fc-part of rATG and
alemtuzumab is sufficient not only for the induction of
inflammatory cytokines, but also for the induction of apoptosis
and degranulation in NK cells (Figure 7).
The cytokines TNFa, IFNc and FasL are induced after co-
incubating whole blood with intact antibody or Fc-parts of rATG
and alemtuzumab (Figure 9), suggesting that high concentrations
of immunoglobulins in patients’ sera may not block the induction
of cytokine induction in vivo. However, it has to be considered in
the experimental setting that cells other than NK cells are positive
for CD16 (e.g. monocytes) [49], which might also contribute to
enhanced cytokine induction. This might explain the different
expression levels for TNFa and IFNc observed in NK cell assays
and whole blood assays. Additionally targeting of CD56+
CD16+
NK cells and induction of apoptosis was abolished by applying
F(ab) fragments, corroborating the importance of the Fc-part of
both antibodies (Figure 8). In this context, it is established that
cross-linking of Fcc receptors is required for IgG-mediated cell
activation. Since the Fc-portion is composed of two identical
polypeptide chains that are related to each other by a two-fold axis
of symmetry, each IgG molecule may potentially bind up to two
Fcc receptors and initiate cellular responses even in the absence of
a specific antigen [50]. Although it is still discussed that the
application of OKT3 is associated with cytokine release [51], our
data suggest that in contrast to rATG and alemtuzumab the
application of OKT3 does not result in NK mediated induction of
cytokines (Figure 7).
Our results illustrate that independent of antibody specificity,
rATG and alemtuzumab affect the effector functions of NK cells
by the ligation of CD16 via their Fc-part. In the clinical setting
peak serum levels of rATG after induction therapy in vivo range
between 60–100 mg/ml for 5–7 days of treatment [47,52] and the
presence of alemtuzumab after a total dosage of 100 mg was
shown to be still detectable after 28 days of treatment (1 mg/ml) in
patient sera [53]. As induction of apoptosis and cytokines in NK
cells was observed at a low dose concentration of 0.1 mg/ml rATG
and alemtuzumab in vitro, we suggest that targeting of NK cells by
these antibodies in vivo might occur even at lower concentrations
as currently used in the clinic. Furthermore the increased FasL
expression may enhance apoptosis in a self-sustaining loop as CD16-
induced up-regulation of FasL expands the capacity of NK cells to
mediate autocrine killing through Fas/FasL interactions [38].
We assume that observed differences in the potency of
degranulation induction or cytokine production (Figures 4C,6) in
NK cells might be due to different binding affinities of the Fc-parts
as alemtuzumab is a fully humanized antibody compared with
rATG although both are of IgG1 specificity. We further included
rIgG as control for rATG, demonstrating that rIgG applied at
higher concentrations can also result in a downmodulation of
CD16 whereas no effect was observed for daclizumab. In contrast
to rATG and alemtuzumab both rIgG and daclizumab resulted in
an impairment of NK cell killing capacity, IFNc production and
induction of degranulation and cytokines only at higher concen-
trations (10–100 mg/ml). We conclude that rIgG contains various
subclasses (IgG1–IgG3) and therefore displays lower specificity for
CD16, in contrast to rATG, which consists of enriched IgG1
fractions. As the effector functions of antibodies are dependent on
appropriate glycosylation of the antibody’s Fc-region and their
affinity to FccR [54], we speculate that this aspect may be relevant
for the different effector functions observed for alemtuzumab and
daclizumab. Although daclizumab has been well characterized
with respect to its glycosylation pattern, information about
alemtuzumab is limited [55].
In summary, we demonstrated that the Fc-part of rabbit or
humanized antibodies in contrast to murine Fc-parts (e.g. OKT3)
is relevant and sufficient for FccRIII mediated effects such as
cytokine release, degranulation and apoptosis of NK cells. As NK
cells are functionally relevant for the effective clearance of
opportunistic viral infections and anti-tumor activity this should
be considered in defining the optimal treatment dosage in clinical
Figure 9. The Fc-part of rATG and alemtuzumab is sufficient to
induce cytokine release in whole blood samples. Whole blood
samples were treated for 2 hours with 1, 10 and 50 mg/ml of intact
antibody or Fc-parts of rATG and alemtuzumab. After red blood cell
lysis induction of TNFa, IFNc and FasL mRNA was observed. Values
demonstrate the results relativized to untreated controls (22DDct
) and
are displayed as means of four independent experiments. Asterisks (*)
