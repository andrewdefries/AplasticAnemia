Cephalosporins are antibiotics widely used to treat infections
in the skin, soft tissues, and respiratory and urinary tracts.
Aplastic anemia (AA) has not previously been reported in
patients treated with cephalosporins. We describe here a 50-
year-old woman who experienced AA after treatment with
cefroxadine.
In November 2009, a 50-year-old woman was referred to
our medical center for further treatment of AA. In October
2009, the patient had received a 3-day course of cefrox-
adine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
and antihistamines to treat symptoms of a common cold.
The symptoms were relieved, but 1 week after treatment
she developed a fever and sore throat. The patient visited a
primary clinic, where a blood examination showed evi-
dence of neutropenia. The patient had taken no other
medications in the 6 months prior to the illness and had no
underlying disease.
Physical examination showed oropharyngeal injection
and soft palate swelling. Her hemoglobin (Hb) level was
9.9 g/dL, WBC count was 300/mm3
, with 3.1% neutrophils
(absolute neutrophil count 10/mm3
), and platelet count was
34,000/mm3
. A marrow aspirate revealed severe hypoplasia,
with almost complete disappearance of cells of the granulocytic
and megakaryocytic lineages, and few cells of the erythroid
lineage. A marrow biopsy showed severe AA (15% cellularity),
affecting all hematopoietic lineages (Fig. 1). She was treated
supportively with broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem)
and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF). Her fever subsided on day 6, and she
showed clinical improvement. Her Hb and WBC and
platelet counts gradually increased. She was discharged
on day 29 with a Hb concentration of 11.4 g/dL, a WBC
count of 4.3×103
/μL (73% neutrophils), and a platelet
count of 102×103
/μL. One month later, her hemoglobin
was 10.8 g/dL, WBC was 4,200/mm3
(52.4% neutrophils),
and platelet count was 107,000/mm3
.
It is noteworthy that this was the patient’s third incidence
of drug-induced AA. She had a previous history of
cefroxadine-induced recurrent AA, from which she had
fully recovered after withdrawal of the medication. In
December 2007, the patient had been referred to our
medical center with laryngopharyngitis plus suppurative
lymphadenitis and AA after taking an unknown drug
2 weeks previously. In April 2008, AA recurred after she
took cefroxadine for URI medications. Initial bone marrow
aspirations and biopsies taken after each incident revealed
AA; 1 month after the incident, she had fully recovered
from pancytopenia after conservative care. We guess that
the drug in the first episode had probably been a
cephalosporin. Cephalosporin was thus involved in at least
2 of the 3 episodes of AA.
Because of its rarity, the mechanism underlying
cephalosporin-induced AA has not been completely deter-
mined. In contrast to agranulocytosis, which is probably
caused by a humoral immune reaction against mature
circulating lymphocytes, acquired AA is most likely caused
by a humoral autoimmune reaction against myeloid stem
cells. A T cell attack on bone marrow leads to the apoptosis
of CD34+ cells, resulting in pancytopenia and symptoms of
bone marrow failure [1, 2].
A prospective cohort study of 102 patients with drug-
induced agranulocytosis over 15 years (1985–2000) found

that 21 patients had antibiotic-induced agranulocytosis,
including 4 patients with agranulocytosis due to a
cephalosporin, 2 due to cefotaxime and 1 each due to
ceftriaxone and ceftazidime [3]. Similarly, of 108 patients
with agranulocytosis over the period 1987–1990, 75 had
drug-related agranulocytosis [4]. None of these patients
with agranulocytosis, however, developed AA. Administration
of high doses of cephalosporin to dogs induced AA, with
evidence of immune-mediated destruction of peripheral blood
cells and marrow colony-forming capacity [5].
The development of AA in association with cefroxadine,
a second-generation cephalosporin, has not previously been
reported. Both the occurrence of AA after administration of
cefroxadine and its spontaneous resolution within 15 weeks
of drug discontinuation indicate that AA in this patient was
probably caused by cefroxadine.
Prior to discharge, we performed an intradermal test with
a gradual increase in concentration to determine whether
this patient had an immediate type I hypersensitivity to
cephalosporin. We found, however, that her recovered
WBC decreased slightly for 1 week after the intradermal
test and no immediate skin reaction occurred. The mech-
anism underlying this reaction is not certain, but it may be
triggered weakly by intradermal injection of antigen
(cephalosporin). The diagnostic relevance and the possible
risks of the intradermal test in AA have not yet been
established.
Cephalosporins are among the safest antibiotics.
Nevertheless, hematological abnormalities, ranging from
monocytopenia to pancytopenia, do occur, albeit infrequently,
following their therapeutic use. Cefroxadine has become more
widely used for simple infectious conditions in primary
clinics. This case illustrates that a severe complication of
antibiotic treatment may occur. Therefore, physicians should
use antibiotics more restrictively only when they are neces-
sary, provide care to patients taking the drug, and be aware of
this potentially life-threatening complication.
