Abstract
The link between endochondral skeletal development and hematopoiesis in the marrow was established in the collagen X
transgenic (Tg) and null (KO) mice. Disrupted function of collagen X, a major hypertrophic cartilage matrix protein, resulted
in skeletal and hematopoietic defects in endochondrally derived tissues. Manifestation of the disease phenotype was
variable, ranging from perinatal lethality in a subset of mice, to altered lymphopoiesis and impaired immunity in the
surviving mice. To exclude contribution of strain specific modifiers to this variable manifestation of the skeleto-
hematopoietic phenotype, C57Bl/6 and DBA/2J collagen X congenic lines were established. Comparable disease
manifestations confirmed that the skeleto-hematopoietic alterations are an inherent outcome of disrupted collagen X
function. Further, colony forming cell assays, complete blood count analysis, serum antibody ELISA, and organ outgrowth
studies established altered lymphopoiesis in all collagen X Tg and KO mice and implicated opportunistic infection as a
contributor to the severe disease phenotype. These data support a model where endochondral ossification-specific collagen
X contributes to the establishment of a hematopoietic niche at the chondro-osseous junction.

Introduction
In vertebrates, the formation of a hematopoietic marrow within
bone is intimately coordinated with the endochondral mechanism
of skeletal development [1,2]. During embryogenesis, hematopoi-
esis is sequentially re-established first in the yolk sac, then liver,
spleen, and finally marrow, which remains the predominant site of
blood cell production after birth [3]. Through use of mouse
models that express an altered endochondral ossification (EO)-
specific extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, collagen X, hemato-
poiesis and immune function have been linked to endochondral
skeletogenesis [4,5,6,7,8].
As EO initiates during embryogenesis, the future axial and
appendicular skeleton, as well as certain cranial bones are first
represented as a cartilaginous blueprint [1,9]. These cartilage
primordia allow for rapid tissue growth, and identify future skeletal
regions where a marrow could form. The eventual replacement of
the cartilaginous anlagen by bone and marrow relies on the
sequential maturation of chondrocytes to hypertrophy. Chondro-
cyte hypertrophy results in an increase in cell size and synthesis of
a unique ECM consisting predominantly of collagen X. Through
the combined effects of the hypertrophic cartilage matrix
components and a repertoire of growth and signaling factors,
there is vascular invasion and influx of mesenchymal cells,
hematopoietic precursors, and osteo/chondroclasts into this
primary ossification center. As the hypertrophic cartilage begins
to be degraded, matrix remnants serve as scaffolds upon which
osteoblasts deposit osteoid, thus forming trabecular bony spicules
that protrude into the newly forming marrow. Continual
replacement of hypertrophic cartilage, together with establishment
of secondary ossification centers at outer (epiphyseal) tissue ends,
defines the cartilaginous growth plates that provide bones with
longitudinal growth potential until maturity. This chondro-osseous
junction, consisting of the hypertrophic cartilage layer of the
growth plate and trabecular bone, undergoes constant remodeling
during growth and is a site where blood cells can colonize spaces
carved out from the embryonic cartilage.
The link between EO and hematopoiesis was first suggested by
the disease phenotype of the collagen X mouse models, where
collagen X function in the growth plate was disrupted either by
transgenesis (Tg mice; [5,6,10,11]), or through gene inactivation
(KO mice; [7,12]). The Tg mice were generated using different
lengths (4.7 or 1.6 kb) of the chicken collagen X promoter to
express in hypertrophic cartilage [6] collagen X with truncations
within the central triple-helical domain (e.g. lines: 1.6–293D and
4.7–21D used in this study). Similar skeletal and hematopoietic
disease phenotypes were observed in the multiple resultant Tg
lines, each with an independent transgene insertion site(s), thus
eliminating the effect of transgene insertional mutagenesis
towards the disease phenotype [6,10]. Additionally, extra-
skeletal presence of either the transgene or endogenous collagen
X was excluded by RT-PCR with species-specific primers,
confirming that collagen X is not expressed in brain, eye, heart,
kidney, liver, lung, muscle, skin, spleen, thymus, and marrow
[13]. These observations were further confirmed by northern
blot analysis, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry
[13]. Together, these approaches implied that the skeletal and
hematopoietic changes in the collagen X Tg and KO mice might
directly ensue from disruption of collagen X function in growth
plates [1,5,6,7,8,11,14].

The goals of this study were to address the cause of the variable
disease phenotype within Tg and KO mouse lines, first by
excluding the potential contribution of strain specific loci
modifications, which in the presence of disrupted collagen X
might contribute to phenotypic variability [15]. Having already
ruled out other potential causes [13], an exclusion of genetic
background influences would directly implicate collagen X
disruption within the chondro-osseous junction as the underlying
factor of all hematopoietic and immune response changes in the
mice. For this purpose, congenic collagen X Tg and KO lines were
established by inbreeding mice to the C57BL/6 and DBA/2J
strains to yield 99.98% homogeneity to one strain [16].
Comparison of the murine disease phenotype in the congenic
mice to the outbred collagen X Tg and KO mice via gross
outward changes, body and organ measurements, histology, and
flow cytometry led to the exclusion of strain specific modifiers as
contributors to phenotypic variability. Further analysis of these
mouse strains via organ culture assays, complete blood cell
analysis, flow cytometry and colony forming cell assays implied
that perinatal lethality in the collagen X Tg and KO mice results
from lymphopenia coupled to opportunistic infections. Taken
together, these data implicate the highly orchestrated events of
EO, involving the collagen X matrix within the chondro-osseous
junction, in contributing towards the establishment of a hemato-
poietic niche that is prerequisite for proper lymphopoiesis.
Results
Phenotypic Variability Persists in Congenic Strains of
Collagen X Tg and KO Mice
Strain specific modifiers have contributed to the disease
phenotype of several transgenic mouse models [15], which was
refined following inbreeding onto a pure background strain. To
ensure that the disruption of collagen X function rather than
presence of strain specific modifiers caused the variable skeleto-
hematopoietic phenotype in the collagen X Tg and KO mice, we
generated congenic Tg and KO lines by backcrossing greater then
twelve generations into C57BL/6 and DBA/2J strains. Such
inbreeding ensured an essentially isogenic background (99.98%
identical) with that strain, except for the chromosomal segment
carrying the transgene/knocked-out gene [16]. The effect of
inbreeding on disease phenotype variability was first assessed by
determining the percentage of perinatal lethality around week-3 in
four congenic collagen X Tg lines (1.6–293D B6, 1.6–293D DBA,
4.7–21D B6 and 4.7–21D DBA) and two KO lines (KO B6 and
KO DBA) as compared to outbred Tg and KO lines (a C57BL/6,
SJL, 129Sv and DBA/2J mix). Comparable perinatal lethality
ratios were observed across all congenic and outbred strains (e.g. a
range of 15.7–18.7% for 1.6–293D Tg line, 18.8–25.6% for 4.7–
21D Tg line, and 7.4–10.6% for KO) (Table 1), suggesting that
variability in disease severity was an inherent outcome of collagen
X disruption. Additionally, the surviving congenic collagen X Tg
mice continued to exhibited transient dwarfism, as was originally
described in outbred Tg mice [5,7], which manifests as a ,21%
reduction in body weight of outbred and congenic Tg mice at
week-3, as compared to controls (Table 2). Body weight of
surviving KO mice, however, did not deviate substantially from
that of controls in any strain. In contrast, ,50% reduction in
overall body size and weight was observed in the perinatal lethal
subset of both the outbred and congenic collagen X Tg and KO
mice, when compared to controls (Table 2).
Comparison of organ weights revealed a similar trend in
outbred and congenic lines. For these analyses, kidney weights
were used to normalize for body size when comparing lymphatic
organs since the kidney to body ratios were similar among all
mouse lines. Normalization revealed a reduction of spleen size in
all Tg lines when compared to controls (Table 2: kidney:spleen).
Moreover, both outbred and congenic perinatal lethal Tg and KO
mice had severely diminished spleens and thymuses, when
compared to controls (Table 2: kidney:spleen; kidney:thymus;
individual organ weights).
Altered Chondro-Osseous Junction, Marrow Cellularity
and Decreased B Lymphopoiesis in Collagen X Tg and KO
Mice
Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the chondro-osseous
junction, the intersection of growth plate hypertrophic chondro-
cytes and the newly forming trabecular bone and marrow, of the
congenic collagen X Tg and KO mice were comparable to the
changes observed in the outbred collagen X Tg and KO mice
(Fig. 1) [5]. Specifically, in both Tg and KO mice, alterations
within the cartilage growth plate zones persisted [5,7] (data not
shown). Moreover, in both Tg and KO mice (Fig. 1B, C),
trabecular bone spicules, comprised of hypertrophic cartilage cores
and newly deposited bone, were reduced, especially in perinatal
lethal subset (Fig. 1D, E). While these changes were most
prominent in rapidly-growing week-3 mice, diminished trabecular
bone and generalized osteopenia persisted throughout life [5].
These defects were seen in all EO-derived axial, appendicular, and
cranial skeletal elements [6,17].
Changes in marrow cellularity of collagen X Tg and KO mice
were detectable both histologically and by flow cytometry. Giemsa
staining of mouse marrows revealed a subtle decrease in cell
density in Tg and KO congenic collagen X samples, apparent as
presence of more open spaces (Fig. 2A). Leukocyte reduction,
characteristic of marrow hypoplasia, was accompanied by
dramatic erythrocyte predominance in the Tg and KO perinatal
lethal mouse marrows, as was also observed in the outbred
perinatal lethal mice (Fig. 2A) [5,7]. These changes were readily
apparent upon skeletal dissection due to the dark red marrow in all
EO-derived bones [7]. Further, flow cytometry confirmed altered
B lymphopoiesis, which revealed diminished B220+
, CD138+
,
IgM+
, and IgD+
lymphocytes from marrows of all outbred and
congenic collagen X Tg and KO mice throughout life, with most
dramatic reductions in the perinatal lethal mice (Fig. 2B and [5]).
The one exception was a transient increase of B220+
B
lymphocytes at week-3 in the outbred and congenic collagen X
KO mice (Fig. 2B). The overall reduction of B lymphocytes in the
collagen X Tg and KO mice was maintained when the number of
live B220+
cells were analyzed, confirming that the alteration in B
lymphocyte percentage was not an artifact of the total number of
Table 1. Percent perinatal lethality in collagen X outbred and
congenic mice.
OUTBRED C57BL/6 DBA/2J
1.6–293D 18.7% (n = 7641) 15.7% (n = 1045) 17.1% (n = 1264)
4.7–21D 25.55% (n = 8204) 18.8% (n = 2620) 24.2% (n = 1641)
KO 10.6% (n = 1595) 7.4% (n = 448) 7.5% (n = 252)
Conservation of perinatal lethality for the outbred and congenic (C57Bl/6 and
DBA/2J) collagen X transgenic mice (1.6–293D and 4.7–21D) and collagen X null
(KO) mice excluded contribution of a strain-specific modifier to the variable
disease phenotype. Percent perinatal lethality was calculated as the number of
wasting mice around week-3 (n) divided by the total number of weaned
offspring given by mutant producing parents.

nucleated cells analyzed, for example the perinatal lethal subset
which has a dramatic reduction in total leukocytes (Fig. 1A,
2A, C).
Altered Lymphatic Organ Architecture and Lymphocyte
Profiles in Collagen X Tg and KO Mice
Lymphatic organs of perinatal lethal congenic mice depicted
gross, histological, as well as hematopoietic changes. Spleens and
thymuses were diminished in size compared to those of wild type
mice (Table 2) and lymph nodes were undetectable. Spleens were
also discolored upon visual inspection and exhibited altered
architecture upon histological analyses consisting of a markedly
diminished red pulp and poorly defined lymphatic nodules
(Fig. 3A-D). Immunostaining for red blood cells (Ter119) and B
lymphocytes (B220) confirmed decreased cellularity in the red pulp
and lymphatic nodules (Fig. 3A-D). Additionally, flow cytometry
of splenocytes from outbred and congenic collagen X Tg and KO
mice confirmed depletion of B220+
lymphocyte throughout life,
with most dramatic reductions measured in the moribund
perinatal lethal mice at week-3 (Fig. 3E, F). Interestingly, when
compared to wild type at weeks-2 and -3, the collagen X KO mice
have increased levels of B220+
splenocytes, mirroring the profile
reported for marrow in KO mice (Figs. 2, 3E, F). Again, the
overall trend of diminished live B220+
cell numbers was
maintained when total number of positive cells was calculated
(Fig. 3F).
Pronounced architecture and cell content changes were also
evident in thymuses from congenic Tg and KO perinatal lethal
mice. Histology not only emphasized the reduction in thymic size,
but revealed comparable changes in structure and cellularity seen
in the outbred perinatal lethal mice (Fig. 4A, B) [5,7]. Specifically,
lack of what should have been an extensive and densely populated
cortex in the collagen X perinatal lethal mouse thymus suggested a
depletion of marrow-derived, immature T lymphocytes; the
medulla, however, still maintained a mature T lymphocyte
population, possibly originating from fetal liver hematopoiesis
[18] (Fig. 4B). Depletion of the immature T lymphocyte
population was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis of wild
type, outbred collagen X and congenic collagen X mouse
thymocytes, revealing a dramatic decrease in CD4+
/CD8+
immature T cells in the perinatal lethal mice (Fig. 4C, D). Taken
together, these data are consistent with the disruption of collagen
X function in hypertrophic cartilage, and not mouse strain specific
modifiers, as being responsible for an altered marrow environment
and the peripheral lymphatic alterations changes observed in the
collagen X Tg and KO mice.

Colony Forming Cell Assays Confirm Altered
Hematopoiesis in the Collagen X Tg and KO Mice
Colony forming cell (CFC) assays further revealed the changes
in hematopoietic cell differentiation in all collagen X Tg and KO
mice. These assays were performed separately for each outbred
and congenic line, and the results continued to be interchangeable;
thus, C57Bl/6 strains or pooled data from all strains will be
presented for the remainder of this study.
The CFC assays quantify multi-potential and committed blood
cells in the marrow by measuring the formation of cell specific
colonies, e.g. granulocyte-macrophage (GM), granulocyte-eryth-
rocyte-monocyte-macrophage (GEMM), erythrocyte blast form-
ing unit (BFU-E), and pre-B lymphocytes (pre-B). There was a
trend in the collagen X Tg or KO murine subsets for an increase
in myeloid GM and GEMM derived colonies (Fig. 5A, B). To
further enumerate the erythroid outgrowth potential of the
collagen X Tg and KO mice, pre-erythroid colonies were
enumerated from marrow aspirates by growth in erythropoietin-
supplemented media. Increased numbers of pre-erythroid
colonies were measured from collagen X KO perinatal lethal
mice, while significantly less were observed from the collagen X
Tg and KO mice with a mild phenotype, all of which can be
visually appreciated with marrow histology (Figs. 1, 2A, 5C).
Additionally, these assays confirmed altered B lymphopoiesis in
the collagen X Tg and KO mice, with dramatic reduction in pre-
B cell colony outgrowth from the perinatal lethal subset, all of
which supports the B220+
, CD138+
, IgD+
, and IgM+
flow
cytometry from marrow derived lymphocytes (Figs. 2B,C, 5D)
[5,7].
The changes in colony number measured in the CFC assays
may have resulted from an altered number of hematopoietic
precursor cells in the collagen X mouse. To test this, we
analyzed bone marrow cells from wild type and collagen X Tg
and KO mice for a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) enriched
population, lineage marker-
, stem cell antigen-1+
and cKit+
(Lin-/Sca-1+/cKit+, LSK), which allowed comparison of the
number of precursor cells from which the GM, GEMM, BFU-E
and pre-B colonies could arise. No statistical difference were
measured between the wild type and collagen X Tg/KO mice,
however the perinatal lethal mice had a reduction in the percent
LSK cells (Fig. 6) [19,20]. Overall, the collagen X Tg and KO
mice had sufficient numbers of precursor cells to generate GM,
GEMM, BFU-E and Pre-B colonies, suggesting that the
differences in colony outgrowth measured are likely due to
changes in differentiation potential of the hematopoietic
precursor cells.
Serum Antibody ELISA Suggest Active Immune Response
in the Perinatal Lethal Subset of Collagen X Tg and KO
Mice
The severe defect in B lymphopoiesis in the collagen X perinatal
lethal mice revealed in the CFC assays (Fig. 5D) may lead to
defects in the acquired immune response toward opportunistic
infections, resulting in the observed wasting of a subset of these
mice. Further, the reduction of LSK cells in the perinatal lethal
collagen X Tg (Fig. 6) mice may indicate a mobilization of HSCs
from the marrow, such as during tissue repair, inflammation or
infection [19,20]. Since activation of B lymphocytes by pathogens
results first in the secretion of antigen specific IgM antibodies and
then IgG antibodies, serum IgM and IgG levels were measured
from week-3 collagen X Tg and KO mice as indicators of
infection. Collagen X KO mice had increased levels of IgM,
consistent with increased numbers of B lymphocytes (Figs. 2B, C,
3B, C, 7A), whereas collagen X Tg mice had elevated levels of
IgG antibody, and there were no differences between the perinatal
lethal subsets and wild type mice. However, the total number of
B220+
B lymphocytes in the spleens of the perinatal lethal collagen
X Tg and KO mice was drastically reduced (Fig. 3C). Thus, if the
level of serum antibodies was normalized to the number of B
lymphocytes present in the spleen, i.e. cells with the potential to
secrete pathogen specific antibody, the perinatal lethal mice had
considerably elevated levels of circulating IgM and IgG compared
to wild type, Tg, and KO mice, consistent with an ongoing
infection (Fig. 7C, D).

Opportunistic Infections Cause Perinatal Lethality in
Collagen X Tg and KO Mice
To assess systemic infection in the perinatal lethal mice, various
organs from week-3 collagen X Tg and KO mice were cultured in
antibiotic-free media. The overall percentage of perinatal lethal
mice with bacterial or fungal outgrowth from liver, lung, and
spleen was fourteen times greater than wild type, whereas tissues
from outwardly healthy collagen X Tg and KO mice were only 2
times greater (Table 3). Additionally, complete blood count
(CBC) of peripheral blood from week-3 mice assessed levels of
circulating lymphocytes and neutrophils, both involved in immune
response toward infection. Total lymphocytes were decreased two-
fold in the perinatal lethal mice compared to wild type cohorts, as
predicted by flow cytometry and CFC assays (Figs. 2B, C, 3B, C,
5D, 8C). Additionally, the collagen X Tg and KO mice displayed
either increased (group A) or decreased (group B) levels of total
white blood cells (Fig. 8A). Further, based on increased antibody
secretion of B lymphocytes and rampant organ microbial
outgrowth in the perinatal lethal mice (Fig. 7C, D; Table 3),
we predicted ongoing infections, which would result in increased
levels of neutrophils [21]. The CBC analysis confirmed an increase
in both number of and total percentage of circulating neutrophils
in the perinatal lethal mice compared to wild type (six-fold and
thirteen-fold respectively), supporting this hypothesis (Fig. 8B and
data not shown).
Discussion
The skeleto-hematopoietic disease phenotype of the collagen X
Tg and KO mice has highlighted an intimate link between
endochondral skeletal elements, specifically growth plate hyper-
trophic chondrocytes and trabecular bone, and blood cell
differentiation within the marrow. To directly implicate collagen
X disruption within the chondro-osseous junction as the sole
underlying factor of all hematopoietic and immune response
changes in the mice, it was necessary to exclude not only transgene
insertional mutagenesis and mis-expression of endogenous and
transgenic collagen X [6,10,13], but also strain specific genetic
modifications as possible contributors to the disease phenotype.
The generation of C57Bl/6 and DBA/2J collagen X Tg and KO
congenic strains revealed conservation of all the characteristic
disease phenotypes observed in the outbred collagen X Tg and
Figure 2. Collagen X Tg and KO mice have altered bone marrow cellularity and lymphocyte profiles. (A) Geimsa staining of longitudinal
sections of tibia from week-3 C57Bl/6 wild type (WT) and C57Bl/6 congenic collagen X transgenic (Tg), null (KO), and perinatal lethal (Tg severe, KO
severe) mice showed mild hyperplasia in Tg and KO and aplasia with an influx of red blood cells in Tg severe and KO severe. (40X) Bar = 125 mm. (B)
Temporal analysis by flow cytometry for B220+
B lymphocytes in bone marrow aspirates of outbred and congenic (C57Bl/6, B6 and DBA/2J, DBA) mice
revealed reduced B220+
lymphocytes throughout life in Tg and KO, with an exception at week-3 in KO, in both the outbred and congenic strains.

KO mice, thus excluding the contribution of strain specific
modifiers to the disease phenotype. These data are consistent with
the disruption of collagen X function at the chondro-osseous
junction, namely the altered hypertrophic cartilage pericellular
matrix [11] and the developing trabecular bone, as being the
primary defects leading to changes within the chondro-osseus/
marrow environment where hematopoietic cells develop and
differentiate (Fig. 1). These initial changes in the chondro-osseous
junction thus likely affect the marrow hematopoietic niche, which
in turn may contribute to the downstream effects on lymphopoiesis
and lymphatic tissue engraftment in the periphery. In support,
thymus and spleen architecture and cell content are altered in the
collagen X Tg and KO mice (Figs. 3, 4). This could be explained
by altered hematopoietic differentiation leading to, for example,
decreased early T lineage progenitor production in the marrow
that resulted in a hypocellular cortex and diminished immature T
lymphocytes in the thymus (Fig. 4). Further, every Tg and KO
mouse exhibits an altered B lymphocyte profile in both the
marrow and spleen (Figs. 2, 3). Moreover, flow cytometry and
CFC assays showed decreased levels of B lymphocytes in Tg and
perinatal lethal collagen X mice at week-3 and transiently
increased levels in KO mice (Table 1; Figs. 2, 3, 5D). These
differences in B lymphocyte profiles may indicate an enhanced
ability of the KO mice to cope with insults on their immune system
(e.g. opportunistic infections), and thus may account for reduced
perinatal lethality at week-3 and overall less severe phenotype
compared to the Tg strains. Of further consideration, lympho-
poietic changes persist throughout life in all collagen X mice,
which may relate to lack of growth plate closure in rodents due to
continued EO. Overall, these data link changes in EO to altered
lineage commitment of collagen X mouse hematopoietic cells,
though not total numbers of precursor cells (Fig. 6), and implicate

the marrow environment of the collagen X Tg and KO mice as
being impaired in its ability to support lymphopoiesis, resulting in
defective immune responses throughout life [8].
Data presented here implicate the disruption of collagen X
function as the cause of the phenotypic spectrum of disease
severity manifestation in mice. Our studies suggest that the most
severe manifestation of the disease phenotype, namely perinatal
lethality, may ensue from opportunistic infections and deregulated
immune responses. Specifically, the perinatal lethal mice have
increased levels of circulating IgM and IgG antibodies, increased
incidence of organ bacterial and fungal outgrowth in vitro, and
increased levels of serum neutrophils (Table 3; Figs. 7, 8B), all of
which are indicators of an ongoing infection [21]. Moreover,
SulfatrimH antibiotic treatment of pregnant and nursing collagen
X females and oxytetracycline injections into mice displaying
perinatal lethality resulted in ablation of the moribund phenotype
(unpublished observation). Additionally, the perinatal lethal mice
have significantly diminished levels of B and T splenocytes,
thymocytes and T regulatory cells, suggesting that perinatal
lethality may ensue from infection and a deregulated immune
response [8]. Further, the immune response in all collagen X Tg
and KO mice at every age is defective, as observed with in vivo
parasite challenges, in vitro splenocyte stimulation with non-
specific mitogens and CBC analyses indicating abnormal (signif-
icantly higher or lower) levels of total white blood cells (Fig. 8A
and [8]). Together, these data further underscore that initial
changes at the chondro-osseous junction lead to defects in
lymphopoiesis, peripheral lymphatic tissue establishment and
immune responses.
In summary (Fig. 9), these data indicate that all Tg and KO
mice with disrupted collagen X function have unique skeletal and
hematopoietic defects that arise from collagen X disruption in
hypertrophic cartilage. Skeletal defects involve all EO-derived
skeletal elements, and manifest as altered growth plates and
reduced trabecular bone (Fig. 1; [5,7]). Hematopoietic defects
manifest as impaired lymphopoiesis in the marrow (Fig. 2),
coupled with increased myelopoiesis (Fig. 5). While it is still
unclear whether these changes in the marrow ensue as a direct or
an indirect consequence of collagen X impairment, we envision
them contributing to the secondary hematopoietic/immune
defects, which involve an impaired lymphocyte population in all
lymphatic organs (Figs. 3, 4), and impaired immune response
throughout life [8].
An emerging provocative hypothesis from this study suggests
that disruption of collagen X function in the EO-derived chondro-
osseous environment may alter the hematopoietic niche. The
chondro-osseous junction includes hypertrophic chondrocytes,
trabecular bone, osteoclasts, the endosteum, marrow and stromal
constituents, and associated ECMs (Fig. 1). Thus, it is plausible
that changes in the well orchestrated events of EO that affect the
hypertrophic chondrocyte-to-trabecular bone transition may
likewise affect the unique marrow environment, leading to

hematopoietic/immune disorders. Support can be found in
human ‘‘immuno-osseous disorders’’ that link skeletal, hemato-
poietic and immune defects, and include: cartilage-hair hypoplasia
(CHH), Kostmann’s syndrome, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome,
Schimke dysplasia, Fanconi anemia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia,
Dubowitz, Omenn and Barth syndromes, kyphomelic dysplasia,
spondylo-mesomelic-acrodysplasia, and adenosine deaminase
deficiency [22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36]. For
example, CHH patients, with mutations in the RNA component
of the ribonucleoprotein complex RNase MRP, present with
disproportionate short stature and deficient cellular immunity
[28,37], reminiscent of the collagen X murine metaphyseal
dysplasia and hematopoietic defects. Additionally, CHH patients
display altered levels of several immune mediators, as is reported
with the collagen X mice [8]. Even though the genetic basis for
some of these disorders does not include obvious players in
skeletogenesis or ECM establishment and maintenance, it is
conceivable that similar pathways altered in the collagen X Tg and
KO mice may also be affected, leading to the similar disease
phenotypes.
Recently, at least two distinct HSC-supportive niches have been
described in the marrow: an osteoblastic niche, ascribed to
osteoblasts residing on bone surfaces [38,39,40,41] and a vascular
niche, ascribed to endothelial cells lining sinusoids [42,43,44], both
of which may encompass the lymphopoietic niche as well [45,46].
For example, the osteoblast niche has been shown to support
hematopoietic development, especially regulation of B lympho-
poiesis. Specifically, Emerson and colleagues demonstrated in vitro
and in vivo that osteoblasts are essential for B-cell commitment
and maturation [47,48], and Scadden and Kronenberg’s groups
demonstrated that this ability may be mediated by Gsa-dependent
signaling pathways [49]. Moreover, Scadden’s group has shown
that HSCs home to and are retained at calcium-enriched regions
where bone is being remodeled, via a calcium-sensing receptor
[50]. On the other hand, Sacchetti et al. have shown that
osteoblasts alone cannot recapitulate a hematopoietic niche upon
transplant, and implicated a subpopulation of bone marrow
stromal cells, the subendothelial cells within sinusoidal walls in
marrows, as competent to generate osteogenic progenitors and to
recapitulate a hematopoietic marrow upon transplant [43]. Taken
together, these data may be interpreted by associating the
postulated ‘‘niches’’ to cells and ECM environments that undergo
or arise as a consequence of EO.
Our group was the first to propose that EO establishes the
specific microenvironment in the marrow for hematopoietic cell
development, which was based on the unique skeleto-hematopoi-
etic defects in mice with disrupted collagen X function [6]. Since
collagen X expression is restricted to hypertrophic cartilage, this
directly implicates the chondro-osseous junction in contributing to
the hematopoietic niche [5,8,51]. Recent data from two other
groups directly support our hypothesis by implicating EO-
progenitors in establishment of a hematopoietic marrow. Specif-
ically, Akintoye et al. demonstrated that transplantation of marrow

stromal cells from EO-derived sites can recapitulate a chondro-
osseous junction with a marrow, while IO-derived cells only
generate dense, marrow-free bone [52]. Likewise, Chan et al.
confirmed these observations by sorting for subpopulations of
either EO or IO-progenitors from marrow and demonstrating that
upon transplantation only the EO-progenitors could recapitulate
an HSC niche [53].
The contributions that ECM may have on hematopoiesis are
still underappreciated. Hematopoietic cells preferentially localize
to bone surfaces where bone matrix, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and
marrow meet [54,55]. Here, these components, together with
stromal cells, vascular cells, and various ECM components
(collagens, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), proteoglycans (PGs),
glycoproteins) [56] encounter to compartmentalize the marrow.
The ECM network not only defines the tissue’s mechanical
properties, but also may mediate hematopoietic cell behavior by
sequestering bioactive factors such as cytokines and growth factors.
Such interactions between the physical components and diffusible
factors likely comprise a hematopoietic niche. A prominent
example of such interactions involves heparan sulfate proteogly-
cans (HSPGs), which are proposed to orchestrate hematopoietic
cell niches by regulating cytokine and growth factor bioactivity
and availability for hematopoietic cells [57,58,59,60,61]. It is
noteworthy that we have shown that the primary consequence of
collagen X disruption within the condro-osseous junction is the
loss of a pericellular network, likely consisting of collagen X in
hypertrophic cartilage [11], resulting in a decompartmentalization
of HSPGs and GAGs such as hyaluronan [11]. It may also be
relevant that a number of HSPG binding cytokines that are
involved in hematopoiesis, immune cell development, differenti-
ation, and response [62,63,64,65] are miss-expressed in the
collagen X mice [8], and thus may affect lymphopoiesis and
immunity.
Overall, we envision that the collagen X/HSPG/GAG network
sequesters hematopoietic cytokines and growth factors at the
chondro-osseous junction for chondrocyte, osteoblast, stromal cell,
and hematopoietic signaling. These cytokines can be liberated
along trabecular bone surfaces upon remodeling, and thereby may
promote hematopoietic differentiation. Such a hematopoietic
niche at the chondro-osseous junction is likely transient, due to
remodeling of the hybrid trabecular bone-hypertrophic cartilage
spicules into mature secondary bone by osteoclasts, as also
Figure 9. All collagen X Tg and KO mice have skeleto-
hematopoietic defects that directly arise from collagen X
disruption in hypertrophic cartilage. Disruption of collagen X
function in hypertrophic cartilage of the growth plate results in the loss
of a collagen X-containing pericellular network, leading to a reduction and
altered compartmentalization of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs)
within the chondro-osseous junction (COJ) [11], as well as altered cytokine
production by COJ cells ([8] and unpublished data). Resultant skeletal
defects involve all EO-derived skeletal elements, and manifest as
compressed growth plates [5], and reduction in the connectivity, mineral
volume and overall amount of trabecular bone (Fig. 1 and unpublished
data). Collectively, these changes culminate in an altered COJ, which
affects the differentiation of resident hematopoietic stem cells, thereby
negatively effecting lymphopoiesis and immunity. Hematopoietic defects
manifest as impaired lymphopoiesis in the marrow (Fig. 2), with subtle
effects on other blood cell lineages (Fig. 5). Secondary hematopoietic/
immune defects, arising as a consequence of an altered marrow
environment, involve an impaired lymphocyte population in all lymphatic
organs (Figs. 3; 4), and impaired immune response throughout life [8].

suggested by Scadden and colleagues [50]. The continual turnover
of this tissue may result in liberation of HSPG-bound cytokines to
the local environment, exactly where hematopoietic cells have
been reported to reside [50,66,67,68]. Conversely, a disruption of
this unique environment would result in altered hematopoiesis, as
seen in the collagen X Tg and KO mice. In support, recent bone
marrow transplantations in neonatal collagen X Tg mice implicate
the defective chondro-osseous environment, rather than alter-
ations in hematopoietic precursors, such as trafficking or homing
issues, as the locus for the observed hematopoietic defects
(unpublished data). Therefore, disruption of the collagen X/
HSPG/GAG network at the chondro-osseous junction in the
collagen X Tg and KO mice may impact sequestration of
hematopoietic cytokines and growth factors necessary for hema-
topoietic cell differentiation. This model would explain the altered
skeletal and hematopoietic/immune phenotype of the collagen X
Tg and KO mice, and may likewise provide a link for certain
human immuno-osseous or hematopoietic disorders.
Materials and Methods
Mouse Generation, Maintenance and Organ Cultures
All animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal
practice as defined by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee, and all animal work was
approved by the Animal Welfare Committee at the University of
Pennsylvania. Congenic mice were generated by inbreeding
females from either two outbred collagen X Tg lines (1.6–293D
and 4.7–21D, strain: C57BL/6, SJL and DBA/2J) or from one
outbred collagen X KO (strain: C57Bl/6 and 129Sv) line, over 12
generations to a limited number of C57BL/6 and DBA/2J males,
and then interbreeding to establish homozygosity [16]. Genotypes
were established via PCR and Southern Blot [6,7,10]. This
resulted in six congenic mouse strains: 1.6–293D–B6, 1.6–293D–
DBA, 4.7–21D–B6, 4.7–21D–DBA, KO-B6, and KO-DBA.
Mice were maintained aseptically in a barrier facility and
inspected daily for growth, behavioral, skeletal, or hematopoietic
abnormalities [5]. Characteristic features of perinatal lethality
around week-3 (usually days 19–21, but occasionally within days
16–30) include reduced size, back hunching, lethargy, mobility
changes, and wasting. Perinatal lethal ratios were calculated as
number of perinatal lethal ,week-3 mice divided by total number
of week-3 mice. Assays with the perinatal lethal subset were
performed prior to demise of the mice. For organ outgrowth
assays, tissues from wild type (WT), collagen X Tg and KO mice
were aseptically harvested, cut in half for duplicates, placed in 12
well tissue culture plates (TKR Biotech products) with 1 ml sterile
RPMI media with 10% FBS (Gibco), incubated at 37uC for 3–6
days, and visually screened for contamination every 12 hr.
Histology
Hind limbs and lymphatic organs from week-3 WT and
collagen X Tg and KO mice from the outbred and congenic lines
with mild (survivor) and perinatal lethal phenotypes were fixed in
4% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) at
4uC for 1 wk. Hind limbs were decalcified overnight in 4%
formalin, 1% sodium acetate, 10% EDTA. All samples were
dehydrated in ascending ethanol series, cleared with Propar
(Anatech), and paraffin-embedded. Six-micron sections were
stained with Giemsa or Hematoxylin and Eosin (Sigma).
For cryosectioning, tissues were embedded in Tissue Tek OCT
(Sakura Finetek), frozen in ethanol/dry ice, and cut to 6–8 mm
sections, which were acetone-fixed (1 min), rinsed in PBS (Sigma,
268 min), and incubated in 0.3% H2O2/PBS (10 min for spleen;
5 min for thymus). After blocking (4% heat-inactivated FBS, in
PBS; 30 min, Sigma), tissues were incubated with anti-mouse
primary antibodies (10 mg/ml in block, 60 min, room tempera-
ture, RT), including CD45R/B220, Ter119 and isotype controls
(purified rat IgG2a kappa, IgG2b kappa, BD PharMingen). After
rinses (with block, 468 min), biotinylated anti-rat IgG (5 mg/ml)
secondary antibodies (Vector Labs, in block, 30 min, RT) were
added, then incubated in Vectastain ABC Reagent (Vector Labs,
30 min, RT) containing avidin and biotinylated HRP, and rinsed
(with PBS, 468 min). Diaminobenzidinetetrahydrochloride solu-
tion (Pierce Chemical Co., 5 min) was used to visualize the
reaction. Sections were mounted with Aqua-mount (Lerber Labs)
and viewed with an Olympus BX60 light microscope. Data was
recorded with the Spot Flex digital camera, Spot software and
brightness/contrast was adjusted with Adobe Photoshop CS.
Colony Forming Cell Assay
Colony forming cell assays involved the murine protocol from
Stem Cell Technologies. Briefly, tibial and femoral marrow was
flushed from week-3 WT, collagen X Tg and KO mice with PBS,
red cells were lysed (ACK buffer: 0.15M NH4Cl, 10 mM
KHCO3, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.4, 1 min), and remaining
cells plated in 35 mm dishes at: 26104
/plate in complete
MethocultTM
, 26105
/plate in erythropoietin enriched Metho-
cultTM
, and 16105
/plate in IL-7 enriched MethocultTM
(Stem Cell
Technologies). These different media support and stimulate the
growth of erythroid blast (erythropoietin enriched, 3 days),
granulocyte-macrophage and granulocyte-erythroid-monocyte-
macrophage (complete, 6 days) or pre-B lymphocyte (IL-7
enriched, 7 days) colonies. Cultures were incubated at 37uC, 5%
CO2, and quantified based on morphological recognition using a
light microscopy as described by Stem Cell Technologies. Results
were plotted in Excel and two-tailed, two sample unequal variance
T-tests were used to establish significance.
Peripheral Blood Analysis
Peripheral blood was isolated via heart puncture using
heparinized micro-hematocrit capillary tubes (Fisher) and submit-
ted to the Special Species Clinical Pathology core at Univ. Penn.
Sch. Vet. Med. for complete blood count. Data was plotted in
Excel and significance was established as described above.
Antibody ELISA
Antibody ELISAs were performed according to Bethyl Labs
Inc. Briefly, blood from heart puncture was clotted at RT, and
serum isolated via centrifugation (6000 rpm, 10 min, 4uC). Levels
of IgG and IgM were assessed using a mouse specific IgG and IgM
kit (Bethyl Labs Inc.) and developed with TMB Peroxidase
Substrate and Peroxidase Solution B (Kirkegaard and Perry).
Plates were read at 450 nm on a Biorad Benchmark plus. To
calculate the level of serum IgG and IgM a standard curve was
generated as per the Antibody ELISA kit protocol. Results were
plotted in Excel and significance was established as described
above.
Flow Cytometry
Flow cytometry was performed as previously described [5].
Briefly, tibial and femural marrows were collected and erythro-
cytes were lysed (0.17 mol/L Tris, 0.16 mol/L NH4Cl). Spleens
and thymuses were homogenized in PBS via a Tenbroeck Tissue
Grinder (Wheaton). Cells were labeled with primary antibodies
(0.2 mg/106
cells): anti-CD4/L3T4, CD8a/Ly-2, CD45R/B220,
IgM, IgD, and isotype controls, followed by FITC polyclonal anti-

rat IgG secondary antibodies (0.1 mg/106
cells). Propidium iodide
(PI; 10 ml at 50 mg/ml) was added for dead cell exclusion. For LSK
analysis, bone marrow cells were Fc blocked then stained with
mouse lineage antibody cocktail (APC), anti-mouse cKit (FITC)
and anti-mouse Sca-1 (PE). All antibodies were purchased from
BD Pharmingen. The FACS Calibur was used with CELL Quest
3.1 (Becton Dickinson) for data acquisition and analysis.
