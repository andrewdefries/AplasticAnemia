One of the possible consequences of the graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR) 1 in
animals and man is runt disease or acute graft-versus-host (GVH) disease (GVHD).
It is frequently fatal and produces a variety of symptoms, which include atrophy of
the skin and the gastrointestinal mucosa and hypoplasia of the hemopoietic and
lymphoid tissues manifested by anemia and immunodeficiency, respectively (1, 2).
Donor T cells are known to be responsible for the induction of runt disease (3, 4).
However, the mechanisms by which T cells induce the pathological symptoms of runt
disease are poorly understood.
Another possible outcome of the GVHR is a chronic GVHD which can lead to
different conditions, such as lymphadenopathy (5, 6), immune complex glomerulo-
nephritis (6, 7), and formation of multiple autoantibodies (8-11). Previous analyses
performed in nonirradiated Fa mice have shown that there are two minimal, essential
requirements for the induction of the symptoms of chronic GVttD: immunocompetent
T lymphocytes must be present in the donor cell inoculum and they must be able to
react to incompatible H-2 structures of the recipient (5-7, 9, 11).
Undefined genetic factors of the T cell-donor strain decide which of the two kinds
of GVHD develop in the Fa hybrid recipients (5-7, 11). This point is best exemplified
by previous studies on groups of identical (C57BL/6 × DBA/2)F1 or (C57BL/10 ×
DBA/2)F1 hybrid mice as recipients ofT cells from the donor strains DBA/2, C57BL/
6, C57BL//10, and B10.D2. When DBA/2 T cells were injected into these Fi hybrids,
a syndrome ensued that resembled systemic lupus erythematosus (7, 11). However,
lymphadenopathy only rarely, and runt disease never, belonged to the spectrum of
abnormalities induced by the donor DBA/2 (5, 11).

In contrast, when the other parental strains C57BL/6 and C57BL/10 were used as
donors for groups of the same types of F1 recipients, a different spectrum of GVHD
developed. This involved lymphadenopathy and lymphomas (5, 6) and a limited
formation of autoantibodies (11), whereas severe immune complex glomerulonephritis
never developed (7). In addition, the development of severe runt disease as an
unwanted side effect of GVHR was frequently observed (5, 11). As far as has been
studied, a syndrome similar to that induced by C57BL/6 or C57BL/10 was evoked
by the injection of spleen cells from strain B10.D2 into (C57BL/10 × DBA/2)F1
recipients (5, 7, 11).
These genetic differences in the disease-inducing qualities of donor T cells from
strains C57BL/10 and B10.D2 versus strain DBA/2 deserve a more detailed investi-
gation. Therefore, we decided to study systematically the effects of GVHR, induced
by either strain DBA/2 or strains on a B10-genetic background, upon groups of
identical Fa hybrid recipients.
Materials and Methods
Mice. C57BL/10ScSn mice and (C57BL/10 × DBA/2)F1 hybrids were purchased from the
T.N.O. Laboratory (Zeist, The Netherlands). B10.D2nSn and DBA/1 mice were purchased
from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine). DBA/2 mice were purchased from GI.
Bomholtg~rd Ltd. (Ry, Denmark). Female B10.BR, B10.S, B10.G, B10.M and B10.A mice
were purchased from Olac Ltd. (Bicester, Oxfordshire, England). All F1 hybrid mice as well as
[(B10.D2 X DBA/2)Fl × B10.D2] backcross mice were bred in our animal facilities, (Central
Laboratory of The Netherland Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
Unless mentioned otherwise, female F1 hybrids, 8-10 wk old, were used as GVH recipients.
Female DBA/2, C57BL/10, B10.D2, B10.A, or backcross mice, 8-10 wk old, were used as
donors. Female B10.BR and B10.G were first used to breed F1 hybrids with male DBA/2 and,
at the age of 5-6 mo, they were used as GVH donors.
Donor Cellsfor Induction of GVHR. Mice were killed and their spleens or lymph nodes
(cervical, axillary, inguinal, and mesenteric) excised. The organs were minced in sterile,
buffered-salt solution. Single-cell suspensions were prepared by gently passing the minced
organs through a nylon sieve and, thereafter, through Pasteur pipettes filled with 1 cm of
loosely packed sterile nylon wool. Bone marrow cells (BMC) were flushed with a needle and a
syringe from the femoral and tibial cavities of donor mice and collected in sterile Hepes-
buffered RPMI- 1640.
Enrichment of Splenic T Cells. To enrich for splenic T cells, the method of Julius et al. (12)
was used. Immunofluorescence studies showed that the cells not adhering to nylon wool usually
contained 3-4% B cells, as determined by F(ab)2 rabbit anti-mouse Ig serum labeled with
fluorescein isothiocyanate, and 60-80% T cells, as determined by applying an appropriately
absorbed rabbit anti-mouse brain serum in combination with swine anti-rabbit IgG labeled
with fluorescein isothiocyanate (catalogue No. F 2190, Dakopatts, Denmark). The viability of
cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion; it was never <90%.
Depletion of T Cells. For the depletion of T cells, spleen-cell suspensions were prepared in
Hepes-buffered RPMI-1640 that contained 5% fetal calf serum. 6-ml suspensions containing 30
× 106 living cells/mi were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with monoclonal anti-
Thy-1.2 serum (clone F7D5; Olac Ltd.) at a dilution of 1:1,000. As a control, spleen cells from
the same suspension were treated with normal mouse serum at a dilution of 1:1,000. Both
suspensions were spun down and resuspended with 6 ml rabbit complement (C) selected for
low toxicity and diluted 1:30 in Hepes-buffered RPMI-1640. After incubation for 30 min at
37°C, the cells were washed three times. The percentages ofT cells present in the anti-Thy-l.2-
treated spleen-cell suspension from strain C57BL/10 was never >1%, whereas the spleen cells
treated with normal mouse serum showed identical numbers of T cells as the untreated spleen
cells, i.e., 30% (range 27-35%).

1476 GENETICS OF T CELL SUPPRESSION IN GRAFT-VS.-HOST DISEASE
spleen cells were injected i.v. into groups of irradiated (C57BL/10 × DBA/2)F1 hybrids, 10-14
wk old. 1-3 h before injection, the F1 recipients were irradiated with 750 rad by using 662 keV
gamma rays delivered by a X37Cssource. 5 d later, the spleens of these F1 animals were removed
and pooled, and a single-cell suspension was prepared. Ceils were washed twice and cultured
for 24 h in 5-ml amounts at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml. The culture medium consisted
of sterile Hepes-buffered RPMI-1640 supplemented with L-glutamine (2 mM), 2-mercaptoeth-
anol (2 × 10-s M), 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (50 U/ml), and penicillin (50 U/ml).
Generationof Fl-activatedDonor T Cellsby Mixed LymphocyteReaction (MLR) In Vitro. Spleen
cells were obtained under aseptic conditions, washed twice in sterile Hepes-buffered RPMI-
1640 that contained 10% fetal calf serum and resuspended in culture medium. Normal spleen
cells from (C57BL/10 × DBA/2)F1 hybrids were irradiated in vitro with 3,300 rad (667 rad/
min) and served as stimulator cells. T cell-enriched spleen cells were used as responder cells.
Responder cells (12 × 10e) and stimulator cells (12 × 106) were incubated in 5 ml medium for
5 d at 370C in humidified air containing 5% CO2.
Cell-mediatedLymphocytotox&ity(CML) Assay. The CML activity of activated donor T cells
and the inhibition of CML activity with unlabeled target cells were determined and calculated
as described elsewhere (13).
Incorporation of SgFeand 5-['eal]lodo-Deoxyuridine (['esl]UdR) into LymphohemopoieticOrgans.
The F1 mice received drinking water containing 0.1% KI during 24 h before injection of
isotopes. They were injected i.v. with a mixture of 0.2 ~Ci [eaFe]citrate and 0.5/~Ci ~2~I-UdR
(catalogue No. IFS 2P, 1.M.355; Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill.). 18 h later, the
spleens, thymuses, and one femur plus tibia were removed from the mice, and the 59Feand x25I
uptakes were measured in a gamma counter. The 125Iuptake of the thymuses was corrected for
the emission by 59Fe.
IgG ProductionAssay. This assay served to determine the amount of IgG released into the
culture supernate by cultured spleen cells from GVH F1 mice. Single-cell suspensions were
prepared from the spleens of individual recipient mice in Hepes-buffered RPMI-1640. Eryth-
rocytes were lysed with a bicarbonate-buffered NH4C1 solution (0.155 M NH4C1, 0.01 M
KHCO3, 0.1 mM EDTA; pH 7.4). After the cells had been washed in Hepes-buffered RPMI-
1640, 1-ml aliquots containing 25 × 106 live cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 that contained
Hepes (10 mM), NaHCOn (12 mM), glutamine (2 raM), fetal calf serum (10%), penicillin (50
U/ml), and streptomycin (50 U/mi). The cells were cultured for 18 h at 37°C. The IgG
concentrations in the culture supernates were determined by a solid-phase radioimmunoassay
specific for mouse IgG.
Radioimmunoassayfor the Quantitationof Mouse IgG in Supernatesof CulturedSpleen Cells. The
principle of the assay was a slight modification of the solid-phase double-sandwich technique
described by Habermann (14). The solid-phase consisted of rabbit anti-mouse IgG coupled to
Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden). Mouse IgG from the test
specimen after having reacted with this was detected by the use of 125I-labeled anti-mouse IgG.
The same rabbit anti-mouse antiserum was used for the solid-phase and 12hi-labeling; it was
prepared by immunization of rabbits with the Fc fragments of polyclonal mouse IgG. Applying
pure myeloma mouse IgG (catalogue No. 8402-24, Bionetics, Kensington, England) to obtain
a reference curve, the IgG concentration in the test samples could be determined by comparison.
IgG concentrations of 100-3,000 ng/ml could be quantitated. The test failed to detect myeloma
IgM (TEPC 183; catalogue No. 8402-39, Bionetics) at a concentration of up to 10,000 ng/ml.
Results
Ability of BlO Strains and Inability of DBA Strains to Induce Lethal Runt Disease (Table
I). For the induction of lethal runt disease, groups of nonirradiated F1 mice were
injected i.v. with 60 × 106 donor spleen or lymph node cells. Whereas the vast majority
of female (C57BL/10 X DBA/2)Fa mice injected with spleen or lymph node cells
from B 10.D2 and C57BL/10 mice, respectively, died from runt disease, those F1 mice
injected with spleen or lymph node cells from DBA/2 survived and did not show even
minor symptoms of runt disease. Injection of B10.D2 bone marrow cells, in contrast

with that of spleen or lymph node cells, failed to induce lethal runt disease. When
male (C57BL/10 X DBA/2)F1 hybrids were used as recipients of spleen cells from
either male C57BL/10 or male DBA/2 donors, we again observed that most of the
C57BL/10-cell-injected, but none of the DBA/2-cell-injected, F1 recipients died from
lethal runt disease (data not shown).
The antigens that elicited the lethal reaction of donor T cells were determined by
the H-2 complex of the F1 recipients. This is evident from the complete absence of
GVH mortality in (B10.D2 × DBA/2)F] recipients (H-2d/a) injected with B10.D2 (H-
2old) spleen cells. The only difference between these F1 hybrids and (C57BL/10 ×
DBA/2)F1 hybrids (H-2b/a) resides in the H-2 complex.
In the presence of an H-2 incompatibility in the F1recipient strains and irrespective
of the H-2 incompatibilities involved, the injection of B 10.D2 spleen cells consistently
induced lethal runt disease. All the other H-2-congenic-resistant donor strains on a
B10 background, namely B10.BR, B10.A, and B10.G, likewise induced lethal runt
disease when injected into the corresponding H-2-incompatible F~ hybrids. If an H°2
incompatibility existed between the recipients and donor spleen cells that were
administered, the only mice that did not develop lethal runt disease were those that
received DBA/2 or DBA/1 cells.
Although the GVH reactivity of the five H-2-congenic resistant B10 donor strains
was fairly uniform in that all of them were capable of indficing lethal runt disease,
there were differences in the extent to which this occurred (Table I). Possibly, these
quantitative differences are caused by the different H-2 alleles of the donor and F~
strains involved.

× DBA/2)F1, [(B10.D2 × DBA/2)F1 × B10.D2] backcross, and B10.D2 mice. None
of the recipients of (B10.D2 × DBA/2)F1 spleen cells died from runt disease, indicating
that the runt disease-inducing capacity of B10.D2 is recessive to the noninducing
capacity of DBA/2. As expected, most (89%) of the recipients of B10.D2 spleen cells
died from runt disease. When spleen ceils from 47 individual [(BIO.D2 × DBA/2)F1
× B10.D2] backcross mice were used as donor-ceU inocula, 53% of the F1 recipients
died from runt disease. Statistical analysis of the numbers of F1 hybrids that were
dead at 14 wk after the induction of GVHR was performed by applying the binomial
test. We examined the probabilities that the percentage of runted F1 recipients of
spleen cells from individual backcross donors were 50 and 25%, respectively, of the
percentage of runted F1 recipients of spleen cells from individual B 10.D2 donors. The
hypothesis that this value is 50% was not rejected (P -- 0.27), whereas the hypothesis
that it is 25% was clearly rejected (P = 0.001). These observations indicate that the
difference in the runt disease-inducing capacity between strains B10.D2 and DBA/2
is determined by one genetic locus, or a number of closely linked loci.
Capacity of B l ODonor Strains to lnduce Lethal GVHD Is Associated with Their Capacity to
lnduce Aplastic Anemia and Thymic Hypoplasia (Tables 11land IV). Injections of 60 × 106
spleen cells from C57BL/10 or B10.D2 into (C57BL/10 × DBA/2)F1 recipients
strongly suppressed the 59Fe incorporation into bone marrow of the recipients, whereas
the injection of DBA/2 spleen cells did not. In contrast, the incorporation of 59Fe into
the spleen was increased, especially if C57BL/10 or B10.D2 spleen cells were injected
(Table III). Nevertheless, the net effect of the injection of spleen cells from C57BL/10
or B10.D2 on hemopoiesis was a severe decrease of the hematocrit values of the F~
recipients. Such a decrease was not observed after the injection of spleen cells from
DBA/2.
The strongly suppressive effects upon hemopoiesis in the bone marrow of the F1
recipients were not observed when 60 × 106 B 10.D2 BMC instead of spleen cells were
administered. This suggests that mature donor T cells were required for the induction
of hemopoiesis suppression. When 60 × 106 B 10.D2 (H-2d/d) spleen cells were injected
into (B10.D2 × DBA/2)FI hybrids (H-2d/d), the suppression of hemopoiesis in the

bone marrow was much less severe than after injection of these cells into the H-2-
incompatible (C57BL/10 × DBA/2)FI hybrids (H-2b/d) (Table III). Because the two
kinds of Fx recipient were identical except for their H-2 alleles, we can conclude that
an H-2 difference between donor and host was required for a profound depression of
hemopoiesis.
Thymic hypoplasia was quantitated by the incorporation of [I2SI]UdR into the
thymuses of (C57BL/10 × DBA/2)F1 recipients. Injection of 60 × 106 spleen cells
from both C57BL/10 and B10.D2 led to a severe suppression of thymic [125I]UdR
incorporation at both weeks 3 and 4 (Table IV). By contrast, injection of 60 × l06
DBA/2 spleen cells failed to induce a significant suppression at week 3 and even led
to a moderate stimulation of thymic cell proliferation at week 4 (Table IV).
Thymic hypoplasia was not observed when 60 × l06 B 10.D2 BMC instead of spleen
cells were injected into (C57BL/10 × DBA/2)Fa hybrids, suggesting that donor T
cells were needed to induce thymic hypoplasia. When 60 × 106 B10.D2 spleen cells
were injected into (B10.D2 X DBA/2)F1 hybrids, no significant decrease of thymic
cell proliferation was observed (Table IV), indicating that an H-2 difference between
donor cells and recipients is necessary for the induction of thymic hypoplasia.
CapacityofDonor Strains to InduceLethal GVHD Is Associatedwith the Capacityto Suppress
Splenic IgG Production in the F1 Hybrid Recipients (Table V). Several Fa hybrid strains
were prepared by mating various H-2-congenic resistant El0 strains with DBA/2.
Mice of these F1 strains were injected with spleen cells from either DBA/2 or a B10
strain (Table V). After 14 d, the spleen cells of the F1 recipients were assayed in vitro

for the amount of IgG released. Although spleen cells of the donor DBA/2 consistently
failed to suppress and, in most instances, induced a marked stimulation of the IgG
production of the spleen cells of the recipients, the B10 donor strains induced a
marked suppression of the IgG production that was most profound after the injection
of high doses of donor spleen cells. The induction of markedly increased IgG
production after the injection of DBA/2 cells depended on the presence of T
lymphocytes in the donor inoculum and on an H-2 incompatibility in the FI hybrid
recipients (E. H. van Elven, unpublished results).
The suppression of IgG production in the spleen cells of the recipients likewise
depended on the injection of donor T cells. Although C57BL/10 donor spleen cells
that had been treated with normal mouse serum and C induced a marked suppression
of IgG production in the F1 recipients, the same number of those C57BL/10 spleen
cells that remained alive after treatment with anti-Thy-l.2 and C did not (Table VI).
Inability of Strain DBA/2 to Induce Lethal Runt Disease is Not a Result of an Inability to
Generate Anti-Fx Killer T (T K) cells. T cell-enriched spleen cells of the donor strains
C57BL/10, B10.D2, and DBA/2 were activated against Fx antigens in 750-rad-
irradiated (C57BL/10 × DBA/2)F1 hybrids, cultured for 1 d, and subsequently tested
by CML on F1 target cells. Fig. 1 shows that virtually no difference in cytotoxic
activity could be detected among the three strains. Similarly, when T cell-enriched
spleen cells of the same donor strains were first activated against F1 by MLR (applying
a responder:stimulator cell ratio of 1:1) and then assayed by CML on F1 target cells,
hardly any difference in cytotoxic anti-Fx activity could be detected (Fig. 2). The
cytotoxic cells generated in this way were completely destroyed by treatment of the
activated cells with anti-Thy-1.2 and complement; in one experiment, a reduction of
the specific lysis from 30 to 2% was observed. Cold-target inhibition experiments with
both in vivo and in vitro activated donor spleen cells indicated that the cytotoxic
activity of T K cells from DBA/2 and B10.D2 was specifically directed against the
opposite H-2 of the F1 target cells (Table VII).
Discussion
Although differences in the GVHR-inducing capacities of different inbred mouse
strains have previously been reported (5, 7, 15, 16), the present data represent the first

systematic multiparameter analysis of such differences. Our experiments were de-
signed in such a way that lymphocytes obtained from several donor strains, strains
DBA/2 and B 10.D2 in particular, could be compared as donor cells for the induction
of GVHR in groups of identical F1 hybrid recipients. In contrast with the T cells of
the B 10 donor strains, those of strain DBA/2 consistently failed to induce lethal runt
disease (Table I) or the symptoms associated with it (Tables III and IV). In previous
studies, it has been observed that even doses much higher than 60 × l0s DBA/2
spleen and/or lymph node cells, likewise failed to induce lethal runt disease, but led
to a chronic form of GVHD, whose hallmark was immune complex glomerulonephritis
(5-7). However, it should be noticed that, as far as the induction of lethal GVHD by
spleen cells from the B10 strains is concerned, the absolute number of cells required
can vary (data not shown). In our experience, this variability was a result of the

hygienic quality of the environment in which the animals were housed. This obser-
vation is consistent with the demonstration that the quality of the intestinal microflora
exerts a tremendous influence on the mortality rate of mice undergoing GVHR (17).
A rather poor capability of strain DBA/2 to induce lethal GVHD has also been
described in studies with parabiotic mice where a better survival was found in
parabionts made between strains DBA/2 and, for instance, (DBA/2 × CBA)Fx than
in parabionts made between BALB/c and (BALB/c × CBA)F1 (15, 18). However,
this experimental design did not allow a comparison of the different parental strains
in groups of genetically identical Fa hybrids. Therefore, the possibility that the
different survival rates observed with the various parental strains were also influenced
by the different kinds of Ft hybrids could not be excluded.
T lymphocytes of the donor are required for the induction of lethal runt disease by
the GVHR (3, 4). In the present investigation, this was reflected by the finding that
inocula of B10.D2 spleen or lymph-node ceils killed the (C57BL/10 × DBA/2)Fx
recipients, whereas BMC completely failed to do so (Table I). Mouse spleens and
lymph nodes contain 30-35 and 65-79% of T cells, respectively (19), but BMC
comprise only ~2-7% of mature T cells (20).
The ability of strain B10.D2 and inability of strain DBA/2 to induce lethal runt
disease was observed in all the H-2-incompatible F1 strains tested (Table I). Although
these two donor strains are H-2-identical and their T cells thus recognized the same
H-2 incompatibilities in all recipients, only strain DBA/2 failed to kill the F1 hybrids.
Hence, both the ability of strain B 10.D2 and the inability of strain DBA/2 to induce
lethal runt disease were independent of the incompatible H-2 antigens offered to their
T cells, i.e., H-2 b, H-2 f, H-2 q, or H-28. In other words, the two different kinds of GVH
responsiveness observed with these two donor strains were not antigen specific.
Because strains DBA/2 and B10.D2 are H-2 identical, the locus or loci coding for
their different capacities to induce lethal runt disease must be located outside of the
1484 GENETICS OF T CELL SUPPRESSION IN GRAFI'-VS.-HOST DISEASE
H-2 complex. This conclusion is consistent with our observation that all five H-2-
congenic resistant B 10 donor strains we used were able to induce lethal runt disease.
A recessive mode of inheritance of strain capacity of B10.D2 mice to induce lethal
runt disease in (C57BL/10 × DBA/2)F1 recipients was indicated by the finding that
(B10.D2 × DBA/2)F1 donors failed to induce lethal runt disease in identical F1
recipients. Moreover, we found that a single locus is responsible for the difference
between nonkilling strains DBA/2 and (B10.D2 × DBA/2)F1 on the one hand and
the killing strain B 10.D2 on the other (Table II). In conclusion, a recessively inherited
non-H-2 locus (or a cluster of closely linked loci), the products of which are not
specific for certain H-2 incompatibilities, accounts for the capability of B10.D2 T
cells to induce lethal runt disease, by which capacity these T cells differ from those of
strain DBA/2.
As death may result from other causes than GVHD, we compared the effects
induced by different donor strains by quantitative parameters as well, such as the
induction of aplastic anemia as a result of GVHD (1). It is known that, during the
first weeks after the induction of runt disease, there is a marked suppression of
erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, which may be partially compensated by a shift of
erythropoiesis from the marrow to the spleen (21). In the present investigation, this
pattern of anemia and disturbed hemopoiesis during acute GVHD was found after
administration of donor spleen cells from both C57BL/10 and B 10.D2, but not those
from DBA/2 (Table III). Thus, by these parameters, too, T cells of strain DBA/2, in
contrast with those of the B 10 strains, proved to be incapable of inducing severe runt
disease. Furthermore, we found that T cells obtained from both B 10.D2 and C57BL/
10 were capable of inducing the severe thymic hyoplasia of runt disease (1, 22),
whereas T cells obtained from strain DBA/2 failed to do so (Table IV).
The inability of strain DBA/2 to induce lethal runt disease cannot be ascribed to
a lack ofT lymphocytes in the lymph nodes or spleen, because these organs contained
closely similar percentages of Thy-l-positive cells in the three different donor strains
DBA/2, B10.D2, and C57BL/10 (results not shown). Nor can the inability of strain
DBA/2 mice to induce runt disease be ascribed to a general inability to induce a
GVHR. This important conclusion is based on the finding that DBA/2 T cells were
an excellent source of GVH-reactive donor cells when it came to the induction of
autoantibody formation (11) and increased IgG production in F1 mice (Table V).
Interestingly, and in contrast with the injection of DBA/2 spleen cells, injection of
high doses of spleen cells obtained from the strains on a B10 background induced a
suppression of the splenic IgG production of the recipient (Table V). In all GVH
assays used, an H-2 incompatibility in the nonirradiated recipients was required for
induction of maximal abnormalities (Tables I, III, and IV).
Pathogenesis of Lethal Runt Disease. Because lethal runt disease kills the host, and
because donor T cells are required for its induction, it has been assumed that runt
disease is caused by donor T R cells (16, 23). Support for this assumption came from
the observation that, in general, the capacities of different donor strains to induce
runt disease correlated with their capacity in vitro to generate anti-recipient T K cells
(24).
However, direct proof for the involvement of donor T K cells in the pathogenesis of
lethal runt disease is missing. Although donor T K cells with anti-F1 reactivity could
readily be rescued from the lymphoid tissue of irradiated F1 recipient mice (Fig. 1;
VAN ELVEN, ROLINK, VAN DER VEEN, AND GLEICHMANN 1485
and [25-27]), up to now there are no reports that such T cells were detectable in
nonirradiated F1 hybrid recipients undergoing the GVHR. We found that strain
DBA/2, although it was completely unable to induce runt disease, nevertheless was
capable of generating T K cells specific for the incompatible H-2 antigens of the F1
recipients (Figs. 1 and 2; and Table VII). Therefore, the genetic inability of strain
DBA/2 to induce lethal runt disease cannot be ascribed to an intrinsic inability of
this strain to generate anti-Fx T Kcells. However, because activated anti-Fa T Kcells of
strain DBA/2 were studied only after short-term exposure to F1 antigens either in
vitro or in irradiated mice, we cannot exclude the possibility that, in the nonirradiated
F1 mice used for induction of lethal runt disease, the long-term activation of T K cells
from strain DBA/2 might have been impaired. If that were so, inhibition of T K cells
exclusively from strain DBA/2 would account for the inability of this strain to induce
lethal runt disease.
Alternatively, a quality in which T cells from strain DBA/2 unmistakably differed
from those of the B10 strains was their inability to induce the severe suppression of
hemopoiesis in the bone marrow, lymphocyte proliferation in the thymus, and IgG
production in the spleen. Taken together, these findings raise the possibility that
lethal runt disease is caused not, or not only, by donor T ~ cells, but by those donor T
cells that generate or mediate suppression of the physiological cell proliferation in
lymphohemopoietic tissues (28-31). The following four observations are consistent
with this possibility:
First, in contrast with donor T K cells with anti-F1 specificity, suppressor T cells of
the donor strain, which account for the general suppression of immune responsiveness
during the early GVHR, were readily demonstrable in nonirradiated GVH F1 mice
(3l, 33).
Second, Shand (31) has provided suggestive evidence that, after the initial specific
triggering of parental-strain T cells by the incompatible H-2 antigens of the recipient,
soluble factors were released that nonspecifically suppressed the formation of plaque-
forming cells by innocent bystander cells. His finding extended the previous obser-
vation that the immunosuppression of GVH F1 animals is nonspecific, because it
affected not only lymphocytes of the H-2-incompatible Fx host, but primed spleen
cells of the parental donor strain as well (32).
Third, a nonspecific component is also involved in the suppression of hemopoiesis
caused by the GVHR, because here, too, the suppression affected not only erythro-
poietic cells of the F1 hybrid recipients but also those of the parental donor strain used
for induction of the GVHR (34). In this type of experiment, killing of donor strain B
cells and hemopoietic cells, by T K cells of syngeneic donors can be excluded, because
donor T cells are tolerant of syngeneic cells.
Fourth, a notable feature of runt disease is that it preferentially affects such rapidly
dividing tissues as the lympho-hemopoietic tissue and the epithelial tissue of the
gastrointestinal tract and the epidermis, where it induces hypoplasia (1, 2). If donor
T K cells were the main effector cells causing runt disease, then it is difficult to
understand why just these highly proliferating tissues, which have a tremendous
capacity for repair, should suffer most. By contrast, if a nonspecific suppression of cell
proliferation were involved in the pathogenesis of runt disease, its manifestation would
be expected precisely in those tissues in which intactness depends on a high rate of
cell renewal.

Summary
When comparing, in a murine model, the kind of graft-versus-host (GVH) disease
(GVHD) induced by the donor strain DBA/2 on the one hand and several H-2-
congenic resistant B 10 donor strains on the other, we found that strain DBA/2 was a
universal nonkilling GVH donor for H-2-incompatible nonirradiated F1 hybrid
recipients. In this respect, DBA/2 T cells differed from those of the H-2-identical
donor strain B10.D2 as well as those of other B10 donor strains. The inability of strain
DBA/2 to kill by GVH reaction was not limited to certain H-2 incompatibilities in
the F1 recipients, but was nonspecific. The inability to kill is determined by a
dominant locus not linked to H-2.
DBA/2 T cells were also incapable of inducing the severe suppression of hematocrit
values, bone marrow erythropoiesis, thymie cell proliferation, and splenic IgG pro-
duction in the F~ recipients that was observed after the injection of T cells from the
B10 strains. However, DBA/2 T cells, in contrast with those of the B10 donor strains,
were vigorous stimulators of IgG production in H-2-incompatible F1 hybrid recipients.
Surprisingly, strain DBA/2 as well as the B10 donor strains had a good capacity to
generate anti-F1 T K cells.
Taken together, these findings raise the possibility that lethal GVHD disease is not
caused, or not caused exclusively, by donor killer T cells, but by those donor T cells
that directly or indirectly induce a suppression of cell proliferation in certain vital
organs of the recipient.
