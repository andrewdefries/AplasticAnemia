Hematopoietic Effects of Benzene Inhalation
Assessed by Long-term Bone Marrow Culture

The strong and long-lasting hematotoxic effect after benzene exposure in vivo (300 ppm, 6
hr/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks) was assessed in mice with bone marrow cells grown in long-
term bone marrow culture (LTBMC). Bone marrow cultures initiated 1 day after the last benzene
exposure did not produce adequate numbers of hematopoietic cells over 3 weeks and, in most
cases, no erythroid or myeloid clonogenic cells could be recovered. The adherent cell layer of
these cultures had a lower capacity for supporting in vitro hematopoiesis after the second seeding
with normal bone marrow cells compared with control cultures. Two weeks after the last benzene
exposure, body weight, hematocrit, bone marrow cellularity, and committed hematopoietic
progenitor content (BFU-E and CFU-GM) were regenerated to normal or subnormal values,
whereas hematopoiesis in LTBMC was very poor. Over 8 weeks, little or no significant committed
progenitor production was observed. Treatment of mice exposed to benzene with hemin (three
doses of 3 pg/g bw iv over 2 weeks for a total dose of 9 pg/g) partially overcame the toxic effect
of benzene on the hematopoietic system as measured by the LTBMC method. Cultures from
mice treated with hemin had a modest recovery of BFU-E and CFU-GM clonogenic potential after
5 to 6 weeks in LTBMC. In contrast, little or no recovery was obtained for the adherent cell layer
clonogenic capacity, even after hemin treatment. These results clearly indicate a strong, long-
lasting toxic effect on the bone marrow stroma and a limited recovery of hematopoietic potential
by clonogenic cells of the nonadherent population after in vivo hemin treatment. Environ Health

Introduction
Benzene is a dangerous environmental
toxin produced in nature and in large
amounts by industry. Chronic exposure of
animals to benzene is known to lead to pro-
gressive degeneration of the bone marrow
and the drug metabolic system, leukopenia,
aplastic anemia, and eventual leukemia
(1-4). The clinical evidence indicating
benzene as a primary inducer of diseases
such as aplastic anemia and leukemia is
well documented (5). Benzene can pro-
duce such toxic metabolites as phenol, cat-
echol, and hydroquinone; apparently these
agents can accumulate in the bone marrow
(6-8). We have shown that hematotoxic
targets for benzene and its metabolites may
be related to depletion of heme and heme

protein and induction of heme oxygenase
(9). The direct effect ofbenzene on pluripo-
tent stem cells (10,11), erythroid (12-14)
and myeloid progenitors (15), lymphocytes
(16), macrophages (17,18), and stromal
elements (19) has been documented. Clonal
cultures of bone marrow erythroid (BFU-E,
CFU-E) and myeloid (CFU-GM) progeni-
tors and spleen colony assays for pluripotent
stem cells (CFU-S) have also verified the
hematotoxic effect ofbenzene (11,12).
Although the mechanisms that induce
hematotoxicity remain unclear, the appar-
ent selectivity of benzene toxicity (or
metabolites) for hematopoietic tissue may
be connected with its capacity to be accu-
mulated by bone marrow several times
greater than that for other tissues (8).
Depression of drug metabolism, growth
factor production, and ribonucleic acid
synthesis by cells of the hematopoietic
microenvironment may also result from
exposure to benzene or its metabolites
(12,18,20). Furthermore, these metabolites
can inhibit heme synthesis and induce the
heme-degrading enzyme, heme oxygenase
(12). Inadequate levels of heme may lead
to a decrease in cytochrome P450 levels,
disturbance of the drug-metabolizing
system (12) and a variety of cellular distur-
bances throughout the hemopoietic sys-
tem; these effects could be attributed to
benzene. We have found that exogenous
hemin can counteract some toxic effects
brought about by inhibition of heme syn-
thesis by heavy metals and drugs (21-23),
and more recently we have studied the
effect of hemin on hematopoiesis in long-
term bone marrow culture (LTBMC)
(24). Heme is an essential component of
cytochrome P450 and the drug-metaboliz-
ing system and plays a central role in the
regulatory network of hematopoiesis under
conditions ofstress (25).
LTBMC represents a near-physiologic
system for assessing growth characteristics
ofbone marrow cells in vitro. The prolifera-
tion and differentiation of stem cells are
dependent on the intimate contact between
the hematopoietic cells and a confluent
stroma (26). The importance of studying
the long-term stromal effects ofbenzene are
obvious, but effects on bone marrow growth
in LTBMC have not yet been well character-
ized. Only a few reports have described ben-
zene hematotoxicity in LTBMC (27,28).
These studies demonstrated a reduction in
the CFU-S compartment in LTBMCs
derived from mice treated with benzene; this
was thought to be due to the action of ben-
zene on both hematopoietic and stromal
cells. This conclusion was reached after co-
culture of normal hematopoietic cells on
stromal-adherent cells derived from mice
intoxicated with benzene and vice versa.
Unfortunately, for the second seeding, a
high dose ofbone marrow cells (l07) had to
be used. It remains possible that a high
inoculum ofcells contributes to the regener-
ation of stromal progenitors for production
of stromal adherent cells and overcomes the
previous benzene toxicity.
Hemin probably has several beneficial
effects on the hemopoietic system in nor-
mal and abnormal states. The aims of this
project were to evaluate benzene toxicity to
murine hematopoietic bone marrow
stroma with LTBMCs and to study the
effectiveness of hemin administration on
hemopoietic regeneration in mice after ben-
zene inhalation. A strong residual effect of
benzene exposure on the capacity of hema-
topoietic cells to generate a favorable hema-
topoietic microenvironment in LTBMC
was observed. Because hemin has been
shown to enhance hematopoietic progenitor
proliferation and differentiation, as well as

total cellularity, we examined the beneficial
effect of hemin on clonogenic and stromal
hematopoietic recovery. Results indicate
partial recovery of erythroid and myeloid
elements after hemin treatment, whereas
damage to the adherent stromal cells was
more permanent.
Methods
Male, specific pathogen-free DBA/2 mice,
10 to 14 weeks old (Charles River
Laboratory, Charles River, Massachusetts),
were used for benzene and control groups.
For second seedings of bone marrow cul-
ture, female DBA/2 mice weighing 20 g
and 8 to 12 weeks old were used. Mice
used in each experiment were maintained
under specific pathogen-free conditions.
Exposure to benzene was carried out in
an isolation chamber system provided by
C. Snyder of the New York University
Department of Environmental Medicine.
Chromatography-grade benzene was used
for inhalation. Groups of 20 mice were
exposed to conditioned air or to 300 ppm
benzene for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week, 2 weeks.
Starting 2 days after the last benzene
exposure, some of the mice intoxicated
with benzene were given intravenous
hemin injections (three doses of pg/g bw)
over 2 weeks.
All bone marrow cultures were prepared
under sterile conditions as described earlier
(24,26,29). Methylcellulose techniques for
erythroid (BFU-E) and myeloid (CFU-GM)
colony assays have been described in detail
(23). The nonadherent cells were counted
and appropriate dilutions were made.
Results
Effet ofin Vivo Benzene Exposure
on Hematopoietic Indices
We examined the effect of benzene inhala-
tion on hematopoietic compartments
immediately after exposure or 12 days after
the last exposure. As seen in Table 1, the
body weights of DBA/2 mice exposed to
300 ppm benzene for 6 hr/day, 5
days/week for 2 weeks were decreased by
15% compared to body weights ofthe con-
trol group. Peripheral blood anemia and
leukopenia were also observed, and hemat-
ocrits decreased to 74 to 76% of normal.
Bone marrow cellularity was suppressed by
as much as 93% in mice exposed to ben-
zene. Furthermore, hemopoietic clonal effi-
ciency was decreased and was seen as a
reduction in the ability to generate BFU-E
and CFU-GM. In particular, mice that
inhaled benzene had diminished clonal
capacity for BFU-E and CFU-GM content
per tibia. This was most striking for BFU-
E/tibia and was decreased by as much as
90% compared with control mice.
As shown in Table 1, significant regen-
eration of hematopoietic elements occurred
after 2 weeks, and recovery of BFU-E to
96% ofcontrol levels was observed. In addi-
tion, bone marrow cellularity improved
(68% of control) and CFU-GM (66% of
control) regenerated after discontinuation
of benzene exposure. Because hemin has
been used to overcome bone marrow toxic-
ity by exogenous chemicals and drugs
(21-23), hemin was injected intravenously
into mice during the recovery time at a
dose of 3 pg/g bw, (over 2 weeks for a
total dose of 9 )ig/g bw), and hematopoi-
etic indices were compared. This dose of
hemin has been shown to be effective in
myelodysplastic patients (30). Better recov-
ery of all hemopoietic indices occurred in
mice exposed to benzene and treated with
hemin compared with mice subjected to
benzene exposure alone (Table 1).
Effect ofin Vivo Benzene Exposure
on Stromal Adherent Celi Capacity
to Support LTBMC
Control and benzene-exposed mice were
killed 1 day after the last benzene exposure
and bone marrow was used for LTBMC.
Bone marrow cells from mice exposed to
benzene were able to form an adherent cell
layer in LTBMC, but production of the
nonadherent cell population was almost
negligible. Consequently, studies were con-
ducted to evaluate the ability ofthe stromal
adherent cells to support the proliferation
and differentiation of normal hemopoietic
cells. LTBMCs from control mice and ani-
mals exposed to benzene were allowed to
grow for 3 to 4 weeks, after which time the
cultures were reseeded with normal bone
marrow cells. The cultures were secondary-
seeded with a single-cell suspension of 1.5 x
106 normal bone marrow cells [the stromal
cell content in the number of cells is not
sufficient to provide an adequate hemopoi-
etic microenvironment (31)]. Thus, cultures
contained stromal adherent cells derived
from cells of mice exposed to benzene and
fresh cells from unexposed animals. The
results are presented in Figure 1. In all cases
we saw depression in cellularity and clono-
genic potential in reseeded LTBMCs grown
in the presence of stromal adherent cells
from mice that had previously been
exposed to benzene.
Effect ofin Vivo Benzene Exposure
on Nonreseeded LTBMC Capacity
LTBMCs were set up 12 days after the last
benzene exposure. Cumulative cell produc-
tion during the next 4 to 8 weeks was sup-
pressed in cultures obtained from bone
marrow of benzene-exposed mice com-
pared with controls (Figure 1). Figure 2A
shows that the cellularity of control cul-
tures for weeks 7 and 8 ranged between
12.5 and 16 x 106 cells/culture for the
same period.
Erythroid (BFU-E) and myeloid (CFU-
GM) colony-forming progenitor cells were
quantitated from LTBMCs derived from
controls and mice exposed to benzene.
Control cultures exhibited significant
cloning potential during weeks 4 through
8, whereas cultures derived from animals
that inhaled benzene had negligible

During weeks 4 to 8, control BFU-E
colonies/culture ranged from 1.3 to 6 x
102/culture and CFU-GMs ranged from
2.2 to 9 x 103/culture (Figure 2B,C).
Almost no colony growth could be quanti-
tated from cultures derived from animals
exposed to benzene during the same cul-
ture period. Hence, the regeneration of
stromal progenitors capable of producing
functionally active stromal adherent cells
was not complete 2 weeks after the last
benzene exposure.
Effect ofHemin on Hematopoietic
Recovery ofMice Intoxicated
with Benzene
Cellularity and clonogenic potential were
determined in LTBMCs with bone marrow
from mice exposed to benzene and treated
with hemin (Figure 2). In all cases, hemin
was found to have significant beneficial
effects on the capacity of LTBMCs to
support bone marrow cell growth after mice
had been exposed to benzene. During
weeks 1 to 8 of culture, cultures derived
from mice given hemin had increases in
cellularity form 1.5 x 106 cells/culture

and CFU-GM growth potential during
weeks 4 to 8 increased from negligible values
to 1.2 x 102 BFU-E/culture and 2.1 x 103
CFU-GM/culture (Figure 2B,C). Thus,

there was modest sparing of clonogenic
potential in LTBMC by cells from animals
exposed to benzene and treated with hemin.
Effect ofBenzene and Hemin on
Hematopoiesis byAdherent Cells
Hemin was given to mice treated with ben-
zene 12 days after the last exposure to ben-
zene in a manner similar to the procedure
described in Table 1. Animals were then
killed and LTBMCs were established for
controls, mice exposed to benzene and mice
exposed to benzene but treated with hemin.
Cultures were grown for 8 weeks, after
which time all of the adherent cells were
removed from cultures, and cellularity and
clonogenic potential were quantitated with
only adherent cells. Results of these studies
are depicted in Figure 3. The data demon-
strate that some population of cells in the
adherent layer ofLTBMCs has the capacity
to give rise to erythroid and myeloid clono-
genic growth. Control cultures gave rise to
approximately 7.0 ± 1 x 102 BFU-E/culture
and 6.3 ± 1.1 x 103 CFU-GM/culture
(Figure 3B,C). It is dear that cultures from
animals exposed to benzene had marked
reductions in the total number of adherent
cells/culture. Note that the cellularity of
control cultures was 15.6 ± 1 x 106 adher-
ent cells/culture, whereas cellularity of cul-
tures from mice exposed to benzene was 3.1
± 1 x 106 adherent cells/culture (Figure 3A).
In addition, Figure 3A shows that in vivo
hemin treatment improved the cellularity of
LTBMCs previously exposed to benzene.
Results demonstrate that adherent cell
numbers in cultures from animals exposed
to benzene and treated with hemin were

6.9 ± 1.2 x 106 adherent cells/culture
compared with 3.1 ± 1 x 106 adherent
cells/culture for benzene exposure alone.
No significant improvement was seen in
BFU-E/CFU-GM clonogenic potential by
adherent cells (slight improvement in
CFU-GM clonogenic capacity was seen),
but this did not appear to be significant
(Figure 3B,C). Thus, in vivo hemin treat-
ment was not as effective for hematopoietic
recovery by adherent cells when contrasted
with the nonadherent cell population
shown in Figure 2.
Discussion
Excessive benzene exposure in humans and
other mammals often results in disorders
such as leukemia and aplastic anemia
(3,5). Disturbed or impaired stroma may
contribute to abnormal hematopoiesis and
thus to the pathogenesis of these disorders
(32,33). Results from our studies clearly
demonstrate the long-term toxic effects of
benzene on the hematopoietic stromal
progenitors and the capacity to generate a
viable adherent cell layer that can support
sustained hematopoiesis. Hemin had some
beneficial effects on the recovery ofstromal
capacity to generate an adherent cell layer
able to support cellularity and clonogenicity
by cells from LTBMC. However, adherent
cell layers from mice exposed to benzene
and treated with hemin recovered only par-
tially both quantitatively and qualitatively;
in these cultures, the relative content of
clonogenic progenitors in stromal adherent
cells with cells in suspension was sharply
decreased. These toxic effects of benzene
and the sparing influence ofhemin are not

obvious if one examines only the hema-
topoietic indices directly from mice after
benzene exposure.
Inadequate production of specific
growth factors or extracellular matrix sub-
stances by the stroma may be one of the
damaging effects of benzene. It is not
clear whether benzene itself is the primary
toxin or whether more toxic metabolites
such as phenol are responsible. We have
demonstrated that phenol is more toxic to
bone marrow CFU-E and stromal growth
than benzene (12). Furthermore, benzene
is known to promote a marked increase in
bone marrow heme oxygenase activity, and
this could contribute to our results (12).
Hemin has been found to reverse some of
the bone marrow toxicity caused by heavy
metals (21) and drugs such as azidothymi-
dine (AZT) (23). It is thought that the
toxicity of these agents, in part, is caused
by a disturbance in the heme biosynthetic
pathway and a decrease in cellular hemo-
protein, including the cytochrome P450
system. Thus, exogenous hemin can bypass
the defective steps and restore adequate lev-
els of heme (21) needed for cell function,
including drug biotransformation.
Macrophages are a population of adher-
ent cells with the capacity to metabolize
benzene; cells of this type are included in
the stromal adherent cell layer of LTBMCs
(17,18). Macrophages and other adherent
cells may also have the capacity to store or
accumulate exogenous or endogenous meta-
bolic products for extended periods of time
(34). The lack of significant in vivo hemin
response may, in part, be related to the
formation of more toxic benzene metabo-
lites in vivo. Damage to cells of the adher-
ent cell population may thus be more
permanent, as evidenced by a poor recovery
in vitro. In this regard, benzene exposure
in vivo produced cell populations that
remained depressed in cellularity and clono-
genic potential over the 8-week period of
LTBMC. This is in marked contrast to
results obtained with short-term CFU
cultures performed 12 days after benzene
exposure. As seen in Table 1, significant
recovery ofCFU potential/femur cellularity,
hematocrit and body weight occurred; these
results do not bear out the more permanent
long-term effects of benzene. The more
immediate recovery of CFUs as seen here
may be derived mainly from cells of the
nonadherent population in the bone mar-
row. Our results from LTBMCs support
this inference (Figure 2).
A direct permanent cytotoxic effect of
benzene on the hemopoietic stroma is

HEMATOPOIETIC EFFECTS OF BENZENE INHALATION
further evidenced by the reduced number
of adherent hematopoietic cells obtained in
LTBMCs from animals exposed to benzene.
Previous studies suggest that some cells of
the adherent hematopoietic cell layer of
LTBMCs are actually a subpopulation of
CFU-S with regard to pluripotence and
proliferation capacity (35). Thus, a depres-
sion in adherent cell numbers by benzene
or its metabolites would result in a perma-
nent depression in stem cell numbers, lim-
ited capacity to regenerate progenitor cell
compartments on demand, or both. This
was seen as a marked depression of CFU
potential by LTBMC for up to 8 weeks in
culture. Nevertheless, this extreme toxic
effect does not express itself so severely in
the more immediate population of nonad-
herent cells, which are probably in a more
active phase ofthe cell cycle.
In conclusion, the strong hematopoietic
residual effects of benzene were demon-
strated in LTBMC. Hematopoiesis in cul-
ture over 8 weeks was on the threshold level,
and little or no progenitor production was
observed by cells from animals exposed to
benzene. Perhaps this concealed and long-
lasting damage ofhematopoietic and stromal
progenitors is an important part ofthe leuke-
mogenic activity of benzene. Furthermore,
hemin may augment benzene detoxification
and alleviate its cytotoxic effect on the
hematopoietic microenvironment.
Irrespective ofthe mechanisms involved
in the accelerated hematopoietic regenera-
tion induced by hemin in mice exposed to
benzene, the use of hemin along or with a
combination of growth factors may be of
clinical importance (25). In fact, hemin
has a beneficial effect on improvement of
the anemia seen in patients with myelodys-
plasia (30).
