Natural Killer (NK) cells are the third population of lymphocyte in the mononuclear cell
compartment that triggers first-line of defense against viral infection and tumor
transformation. Historically, NK cells were thought of as components of innate immunity
based on their intrinsic ability to spontaneously kill target cells independent of HLA antigen
restriction. However, it is now clear that NK cells are quite sophisticated and use a highly
specific and complex target cell recognition receptor system arbitrated via a multitude
of inhibitory and activating receptors. Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are
the key receptors of human NK cells development and function. To date, fourteen distinct
KIRs have been identified: eight are inhibitory types, and six are activating types. The num-
ber and type of KIR genes present varies substantially between individuals. Inhibitory KIRs
recognize distinct motifs of polymorphic HLA class I molecules. Upon engagement of
their specific HLA class I ligands, inhibitory KIR dampen NK cell reactivity. In contrast,
activating KIRs are believed to stimulate NK cell reactivity when they sense their ligands
(unknown). KIR and HLA gene families map to different human chromosomes (19 and
6, respectively), and their independent segregation produces a wide diversity in the num-
ber and type of inherited KIR-HLA combinations, likely contributing to overall immune
competency. Consistent with this hypothesis, certain combinations of KIR-HLA variants
have been correlated with susceptibility to diseases as diverse as autoimmunity, viral in-
fections, and cancer. This review summarizes our emerging understanding of KIR-HLA
diversity in human health and disease.

NATURAL KILLER CELLS
Natural killer (NK) cells of innate immunity and CD8
+
cytotoxic T cells (CTL) of adaptive immunity are professional
killer cells that are necessary for defense against virus-in-
fected or tumor-transformed cells. NK cells and CTLs both
originate from a common lymphoid progenitor and share
several features in their development, morphology, cell-sur-
face phenotypes and effector functions [1]. Recent reports
further reveal unexpected similarities between these killer
subsets in developing specific memory response that repeal
the fundamental discrepancy between innate and adaptive
immune cells [2, 3]. Similar to T and B cells of adaptive
immunity, NK cells are educated during development, pos-
sess antigen-specific receptors, undergo clonal expansion
during infection and generate long-lived memory cells.
However, NK cells and CTLs differ in their cell surface
receptors used to distinguish unhealthy cellular targets from
the healthy host cells (Fig. 1). Whereas CTL activation is
triggered through the interaction of a somatically re-arranged
T cell receptor with a specific foreign peptide-laden human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecule displayed by in-
fected cells, the NK cells use a multitude of germ line-encoded
receptor recognition strategies, whereby an individual NK
cell can be triggered through various receptors with in-
hibitory or activating function, independently or in combina-
tion, depending on the ligands presented by the target cell
in a given encounter [4-6]. If a given NK cell uses both
inhibitory and activating receptors to recognize the target,
the balance between these disparate signals determines the
action of that NK cell [7].

Fig. 1. Professional killer cell response. Natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells (CTL) are professional killer cells and share several common
features but differ by their HLA class I-specific receptors that are used to distinguish unhealthy targets from the healthy host cells. CTLs express
activating T cell receptors (TCR) while NK cells express both inhibitory and activating receptors. No activation is triggered if the TCR recognize a
self-peptide laden HLA class I molecule (a). TCR can trigger cytolysis if it detects a viral peptide loaded in the groove of HLA class I molecules of
infected cells (b). Contrarily, the inhibitory receptors of NK cell recognize HLA class I molecules and trigger signals that stop spontaneous lytic
activity of NK cells (c). By expressing normal levels of HLA class I molecules, the healthy cells are tolerant to NK cell lysis. Downregulation of HLA
class I expression due to tumor transformation or viral infection relieves the inhibitory influence on NK cells, permitting NK cells to lyse the
unhealthy target cells (d). The NK cell lysis can be augmented by further interactions between the activating receptors and putative ligands expressed
upon infection or transformation (e).
NK CELL RECEPTORS
Several gene families encode receptors for NK cells that
trigger inhibitory or activating function, such as (i) killer
cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR), (ii) killer cell lec-
tin-like receptors (KLR), (iii) leukocyte immunoglobulin-like
receptors (LILR), and (iv) natural cytotoxicity receptors
(NCR) [7-9]. Most of these receptors are expressed in a sto-
chastic manner such that each NK cell clone within a given
individual does not express the entire set of NK receptor
genes present in that individual’s genome, but rather only
a portion of the genes in an apparently random combination
[6, 10]. Variegated expression of multiple activating and in-
hibitory receptors results in an unexpected heterogeneity
in NK subsets that yields a broad range of functionally distinct
NK cell clones, which presumably are critical for a rapid
and sensitive detection of infected cellular targets.
Because NK cells circulate in a state that can spontaneously
deliver effector function, it is essential to block them from
attacking healthy tissues. NK cells in peripheral blood express
at least one inhibitory receptor for self-HLA class I molecules
and thus provide tolerance to healthy cells that normally
express abundant HLA class I molecules [6]. Down regulation
of HLA class I expression due to certain viral infections,
neoplastic transformations, or other forms of stress, relieves
the inhibitory influence on NK cells, permitting NK cells
to eliminate these unhealthy cells, a phenomenon originally
described as the ‘missing-self’ hypothesis [11] (Fig. 1).
Furthermore, by recognizing unknown ligands expressed on
the target cells, such as ‘induced-self’ that are structurally
related to HLA class I molecules (e.g., MICA and MICB),

tide) or pathogen encoded ‘non-self’ (molecules associated

receptors may further augment NK lysis of unhealthy cells.
KILLER CELL IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE
RECEPTORS (KIR)
Originating in simian primates, the KIR is relatively a
new gene family that evolves rapidly to keep up with spe-
cies-specific evolution and adaptation [12]. Because KIRs
have considerable species-specificity and are lacking in ro-
dents, it is critical to study humans to understand the impact
of KIR on health and disease. KIR receptors play a key
role in human NK cell development and function, and differ
from other NK cell receptors by their substantial diversity,
which is contributed by individual-specific KIR gene content
and nucleotide sequence polymorphism of each KIR gene.
Fourteen KIR receptors (plus 2 pseudogenes; 2DP1 and 3DP1)
have been identified in humans that trigger inhibition
(3DL1-3, 2DL1-3, 2DL5), activation (3DS1, 2DS1-5), or both
(2DL4) (Fig. 2).
KIR receptors are encoded by a family of tightly clustered
genes on the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) spanning
a region of about 150 kb on chromosome 19q13.4 [13]. Being
diploid, humans ordinarily have two copies of each autosomal
gene, one per chromosome. However, the KIR gene family
violates this basic rule due to deletion or duplication. The
number and type of KIR genes may differ substantially be-
tween two chromosomes (Fig. 3). Over 30 distinct KIR hap-
lotypes with distinct gene content have been characterized
to date by sequencing genomic clones and haplotype segrega-
tion analysis in families [13-18]. One of the haplotypes that
occurs in all populations is conventionally named the ‘A
haplotype’, which consists of nine genes (3DL3-2DL3-2DP1-
2DL1-3DP1-2DL4-3DL1-2DS4-3DL2) and encodes predom-
inantly inhibitory receptors (Fig. 3; haplotype 1) [13].
Remaining haplotypes are collectively referred to as ‘group
B haplotypes’, which have variable gene content comprising
several genes (2DS1, 2DS2, 2DS3, 2DS5, 2DL2, 2DL5, and
3DS1) that are not part of the A haplotype, and thus B
haplotypes encode more activating KIRs compared with the
A haplotype that encodes a single activating receptor,
KIR2DS4 (Fig. 3; haplotypes 2-22). In addition to the sub-
stantial variation in gene content across haplotypes, each
KIR gene itself exhibits considerable nucleotide sequence
polymorphism [18-20]. To date, 614 KIR nucleotide se-

quences encoding 321 distinct KIR proteins (Fig. 2) have
been deposited in IPD-KIR database (Release 2.4.0, 15 April
2011), a database that provides the centralized repository
for human KIR sequences (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/kir/).
The sequence polymorphism can influence the expression,
ligand binding, and functional capacity [16, 21-24]. A large
number of amino acid substitutions occurred among the
allelic variants of each inhibitory KIR gene are predom-
inantly located at the sites not directly implicated in HLA
class I ligand binding [25, 26]. A number of these substitutions
were shown to be the subject of positive selection, and thus
the evolutionary pressure that drives KIR sequence poly-
morphism is presumably more than polymorphic HLA class
I recognition and possibly involves rapidly evolving pathogen
recognition.
Only four KIR genes (2DL4, 3DL2, 3DL3, and 3DP1) are
present on all haplotypes and are referred to as ‘framework’
genes, while the existence of 12 other genes is considerably
variable by haplotype [13]. A stretch of 14 kb DNA enriched
with L1 repeats placed between 3DP1 and 2DL4 divides
the KIR haplotype into two halves [13] (Fig. 3). The centro-
meric half is delimited by 3DL3 at the 5´-end and 3DP1
at the 3´-end, while the telomeric half is delimited by 2DL4
at the 5´-end and 3DL2 at the 3´-end. The inhibitory re-
ceptors, KIR2DL2 and 2DL3, segregate as alleles of a single
locus at the centromeric half. Similarly, the inhibitory
KIR3DL1 and activating KIR3DS1 behave as alleles of the
same locus at the telomeric half. Almost all haplotypes con-
tain these two loci, such that virtually everyone has either
2DL2 or 2DL3, and 3DL1 or 3DS1 within their KIR genome.
KIR2DL1, 2DL2, 2DL3 and 2DS2 are specific to the centro-
meric half, while KIR3DL1, 3DS1, 2DS1, and 2DS4 are specif-
ic to the telomeric half. Three KIR genes, 2DL5, 2DS3 and
2DS5, are found in both centromeric and telomeric locations
[15, 27]. For genes within each half, there is significant
linkage disequilibrium, but much less for genes in the two
different halves [18, 19].
Multiple reciprocal recombination events at the center
of the KIR complex, between 3DP1 and 2DL4, presumably
diversify gene content for KIR haplotypes across individuals
and populations [28, 29]. Most of the KIR gene content
haplotypes published to date can be explained by the re-
combination of 10 centromeric and 10 telomeric gene content
motifs (Fig. 4). For example, haplotype 1 listed in Fig. 3
is a recombinant of the centromeric half cA01 and telomeric
half tA01, similarly haplotype 8 is a recombinant of the
centromeric half cB02 and telomeric half tB02. The reciprocal
recombination also results in haplotypes carrying both
group-A and group-B haplotype-specific motifs. For instance,
haplotype 6 listed in Fig. 3 is a recombinant of the centro-
meric half cA01 and telomeric half tB04, and haplotype
9 is a recombinant of the centromeric half cB03 and telomeric

Fig. 4. Centromeric and telomeric halves of KIR haplotypes. A stretch of 14 kb DNA with numerous L1 repeats that interconnects KIR3DP1 and
KIR2DL4 divides the KIR haplotype into two halves. The centromeric half is delimited by 3DL3 and 3DP1, while the telomeric half is delimited by
2DL4 and 3DL2. Multiple reciprocal meiotic recombination events between 3DP1 and 2DL4 shuffle the centromeric (c) and telomeric (t) motifs,
and thus diversify gene content of KIR haplotypes across individuals and populations. Most of the KIR gene content haplotypes published to date
can be explained by the recombination of these 10 centromeric and 10 telomeric gene content motifs. The framework genes, present in all
haplotypes are shown in dark boxes; genes encoding activating KIR are in orange boxes; and those for inhibitory receptors are in blue boxes. The

tA01. Recombination events also are reported outside the
region between 3DP1 and 2DL4. These are generally non-
allelic crossovers generating several unusual haplotypes, in-
cluding truncated haplotypes that are missing some frame-
work genes [15, 19] or elongated haplotypes that contain
duplicated genes [30].
Inheritance of paternal and maternal haplotypes compris-
ing different gene content (A+A, A+B, or B+B) generates
extraordinary KIR diversity in humans (Fig. 5). For example,
carriers of two A haplotypes have only seven functional
KIR genes, while the carriers of both A and B haplotypes
may have all 14 functional KIR genes. Several population
studies revealed over 300 genotypes that differ in their KIR
gene content and each population carries a distinct gene
content profile [28, 31] (http://www.allelefrequencies.net/).
All human populations have both group-A and -B haplotypes,
but their distribution varies considerably across distinct pop-
ulations (Fig. 6). Individuals carrying both A and B haplotypes
are more common in Caucasians and Africans, and therefore
A and B haplotypes are approximately equally distributed
in these populations [28, 32]. In contrast, the prevalence
of A haplotypes dominates over the B haplotypes in one
population and vice versa in others. Individuals carrying
homozygous A haplotypes (AA genotypes) are common in
Northeast Asians (Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans) [17, 33,
34]. Conversely, individuals carrying Bx genotypes (either
AB or BB) are common in the natives of America [35, 36],
Australia [37], and India [38-40]. The NK cells from AA
genotype carriers can express a maximum of four inhibitory
KIRs (2DL1, 2DL3, 3DL1 and 3DL2) and one activating KIR
(2DS4). In contrast, individuals carrying Bx genotypes can
express a maximum of six inhibitory KIRs (2DL1-3, 2DL5,
3DL1, and 3DL2) and 2 to 6 activating KIRs (3DS1, 2DS1-5).
NK cells of Bx genotype carriers express more activating
KIR receptors and respond more vigorously to a range of
pathogens. These data suggest that the aboriginal populations
of India, Australia, and America acquired activating KIR
genes to survive disease epidemics and population bottle-
necks during their extensive pre-historic migrations from
Africa [38].
LIGANDS FOR KIR RECEPTORS
KIR receptors recognize specific motifs of HLA class I
molecules, which are the products of highly polymorphic
genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) located
on chromosome 6 [41-43] (Fig. 2). HLA-C is the dominant
HLA class I locus that provides ligands for many KIR
receptors. All HLA-C allotypes carry valine (V) at position
76, while position 80 displays a dimorphism of either aspar-
agine (N) or lysine (K). Nearly half of the HLA-C allotypes
(Cw2, Cw4, Cw5, Cw6, and Cw15) carry a K80 (conventio-
nally termed C2 epitope) that binds inhibitory receptor
KIR2DL1 [44-46]. The remaining HLA-C allotypes (Cw1,
Cw3, Cw7, and Cw8) carry N80 (termed C1 epitope) and
bind inhibitory receptors KIR2DL2 and 2DL3. Two excep-
tionally diverse HLA-B allotypes, B46 and B73 that both
have V76 and N80 motifs, are good ligands for KIR2DL2/3
[47]. In addition to C1 binding, the KIR2DL2/3 can also
interact with several C2 allotypes, notably C*0501 and C*0202
[47]. The inhibitory signals triggered by the 2DL2/3-C1 inter-
action is relatively weaker as compared to those triggered
by the 2DL1-C2 interaction [21, 47]. The activating KIR
receptor KIR2DS1 has similar Ig-like domains to inhibitory
KIR2DL1 and also binds HLA-C2, but with reduced avidity

and feature substantial variation between haplotypes in the number and type of genes. Panel I illustrates variation between parents in KIR and HLA

HLA haplotype. Random associations of gametes form zygotes of the next generation carrying one of the 16 possible combinations of paternal and
maternal KIR and HLA haplotypes, producing substantial diversity between offspring in the number and type of inhibitory KIR-HLA combinations
and activating KIR genes inherited (Panel III).

Fig. 6. A and B haplotype distribution varies across distinct populations.
The A and B KIR haplotypes are approximately equally distributed in
Caucasians and Africans. In contrast, the prevalence of A haplotypes
dominates over the B haplotypes in Northeast Asians (Chinese,
Japanese, and Koreans) and vice versa in the natives of America,
Australia, and India. As we described elsewhere, the frequency of group
A and B KIR haplotypes were predicted from the KIR gene content data
published previously for other populations [112].
[48]. KIR2DS2 is an activating receptor that has similar Ig-like
domains to inhibitory KIR2DL2 but has no detectable avidity
for HLA-C1 [21]. KIR2DS4 is the oldest and most prevalent
activating receptor and has unique ligand specificity for sub-
sets of HLA-C allotypes carrying C1 or C2 epitopes and
HLA-A11 [49].
Since the C1 and C2 are non-overlapping subsets of HLA-C
allotypes, individuals can be either C1 homozygous, C2 ho-
mozygous or C1/C2 heterozygous. Contrarily, only a subset
of HLA-A (HLA-A23, 24, 25 and 32) and HLA-B (40% of
the known B allotypes) molecules that carry a Bw4 epitope
in a similar region (residues 77-83) function as ligands for
the KIR3DL1 receptor [50-52] (Fig. 2). KIR3DL2 binds to
only HLA-A3 and A11 allotypes, and the strength of this
interaction is highly sensitive to the bound peptide sequence
[53, 54]. The KIR2DL4 receptor binds to the extravillous
trophoblast-specific HLA-G molecule and induces rapid
IFN-γ production that promotes vascularization of the mater-
nal decidua, which provides the placenta with blood and
the growing fetus with gases and nutrients [55-58]. In addi-
tion to its activation function, the KIR2DL4 receptor carries
a single ITIM motif in its cytoplasmic tail and exhibits an
inhibitory function [59, 60]. The ligand specificities for
KIR2DS2, 2DS3, 2DS5, 3DS1, and 2DL5 remain elusive.
Epidemiological studies implicate HLA-Bw4 specificity for
KIR3DS1 [61].
DIVERSITY OF KIR-HLA COMPOUND GENOTYPES
AND RELAVANCE IN DISEASE
Variable KIR and HLA gene families segregate in-
dependently, yielding many individuals who express KIR
receptors for which they lack HLA class I ligands, and vice
versa, thus creating human diversity in the number and
type of KIR-HLA gene combinations that can modulate dis-
ease outcomes [62] (Fig. 5). Nevertheless, at the population
level, there is compelling evidence for coevolution of inter-
acting KIR-HLA pairs [63, 64]. Although most individuals
have all four well-defined inhibitory KIR receptors (3DL1,
3DL2, 2DL1 and 2DL2/3), we found only a subset expressing
all relevant HLA class I ligands, HLA-Bw4 (3DL1),
HLA-A3/11 (3DL2), HLA-C2 (2DL1), and HLA-C1 (2DL2/3)
[62]. The majority of Caucasians, Hispanics, and African
Americans carry either two or three inhibitory KIR-HLA
combinations. Interestingly, one out of five individuals in
these populations carries only a single receptor-ligand pair,
KIR2DL3+HLA-C1. Environmental invectives, such as viral
infections, affecting HLA-C expression in individuals carry-
ing this single KIR-HLA combination can break self-toler-
ance and may endorse autoimmunity. Importantly, each sub-
ject tested in the panel of 759 had at least one of these
four inhibitory KIR receptor-HLA class I ligand pairs. This
finding is biologically relavent to the the studies showing
that the NK cells lacking inhibitory receptors for self-MHC
class I molecules were hyporesponsive when compared to
the NK cells that had a self-MHC class I ligand [2]. The
signals triggered through inhibitory receptors upon binding
to the specific self-MHC class I are involved in ‘licensing’
[2, 65], ‘arming’ [66], or ‘education’ [67], a process by which
the NK cells acquire functional competence. Therefore, it
appears that a minimum of one inhibitory KIR+HLA inter-
action is crucial for the development of functional NK cells
in humans. In summary, interactions of KIR to HLA class
I ligands set the threshold of NK cell capacity as well as
control the NK cell response.
KIR-HLA IN INFECTION
Viral infection downregulates expression of HLA class
I molecules on the surface of infected cells to escape from
CTL responses, which renders these class I-negative un-
healthy cells as potential targets for NK lysis by the miss-
ing-self mechanism (Fig. 1). The impact of NK cells on an-
ti-viral immunity is underscored by the fact that patients
with NK cell deficiencies and patients with impaired NK
cell activity suffer from recurrent, life-threatening virus
infections. Understanding the host KIR-HLA genetic compo-
sition that favors successful eradication of virus is especially
important for therapeutic vaccination strategies.
Epidemiological studies have identified that host genetic
variation at the HLA class I locus has a stronger influence
on HIV-1 disease outcome than that of any other genetic

KIR receptors 223
locus identified so far [68, 69]. The HLA class I alleles most
widely accepted as protective (B*27 and B*57) both carry
Bw4, a ligand for KIR3DL1 and possibly for KIR3DS1. About
40% of the observed HLA-B alleles display Bw4, and the
remainder HLA-B alleles share the alternative public epitope
Bw6. Differential advantage of Bw4-bearing over Bw6-bear-
ing alleles in antigen presentation could neatly connect this
broad class I epitopic variation with the increasingly prom-
inent contribution of CTL control and escape in the patho-
genesis of AIDS [70, 71]. More recently, a significant associa-
tion has been described between slower progression in an-
ti-retroviral therapy naive seroconverters and the expression
of an activating receptor KIR3DS1, in conjunction with its
putative ligand, Bw4-bearing HLA-B molecules with an iso-
leucine at position 80 (referred to as Bw4I80
) in patients
of European or African ancestries, which was the first to
implicate an activating KIR in NK cell activation that has
biological significance in anti-viral immunity [61]. Based
on this genetic association, KIR3DS1 on NK cells was pro-
posed to bind to HLA-Bw4I80
on HIV-1 infected target cells,
thereby signaling the NK cell to kill the infected target.
The KIR3DS1-HLA-Bw4I80
compound genotype was further
shown to correlate with lower viral load and protection
from opportunistic infections, such as pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia, cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, and myco-
bacterium avium complex [72]. Surprisingly, the inhibitory
compound genotype consisting of a subset of KIR3DL1 alleles
with high expression and high inhibitory capacity and
HLA-Bw4I80
demonstrated significant protection from AIDS
progression in the same seroconverted cohorts that showed
a protective effect of the KIR3DS1-HLA-Bw4I80
genotype,
and it was also associated with lower mean viral loads [61].
Protection by a highly inhibitory KIR-HLA genotype may
be attributed to more efficient education of these high-ex-
pressing KIR3DL1-positive NK cells during their maturation
process, eventually resulting in stronger activation of those
NK cells, when their ligand is downregulated. Therefore,
the efficient engagement of both activating and inhibitory
KIR is likely to be beneficial for the host in viral infection.
Currently 130-170 million people believed to be infected
with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), who will either resolve
acute infection or progress to chronic infection. The 80%
of individuals who become chronically infected have a sub-
stantial risk of developing end-stage liver disease, including
liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [73]. By compar-
ing the presence or absence of KIR-HLA gene combinations,
protection against chronic HCV is shown to be conferred
by homozygosity of the genes for the inhibitory receptor
KIR2DL3 and its ligand HLA-C with asparagine at position
80 [74, 75]. This protective effect is limited to individuals
infected by intravenous drug use or accidental needle-stick
injury (low inoculum of virus) but no effect is observed
in cases infected by transfusion of blood products, in which
the innate immune response is thought to be overwhelmed
by the higher infecting inoculum. Since the KIR2DL3 binds
HLA-C with a lower avidity than other inhibitory KIR [21],
the weak inhibitory signals triggered by this low affinity
combination (i.e., the lack of strong NK cell inhibition) pre-
sumably being overridden by activating signals of non-
variable activating receptors.
AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE
NK cells are capable of interacting with a number of cell
types through cytokine production and direct cell-cell con-
tact, which have the potential to drive the chronic
inflammation. However, accumulating evidence outlined
conflicting results of the effect of NK cells in promoting
or suppressing inflammatory responses and autoimmune dis-
ease development. A protective role for NK cells has been
reported in animal models of diabetes [76], colitis [77], and
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [78], while in
contrast, NK cells have been shown to promote auto-
immunity in models of neonatal autoimmune ovarian disease
[79] and experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis [80].
A significant decline in the NK cell population has been
reported in the peripheral blood of patients with a variety
of autoimmune disorders, but it is unclear if these alterations
are a consequence of ongoing inflammation or are an under-
lying cause of autoimmunity.
Although the cell surface expression and ligands for acti-
vating KIR receptors have not been clearly defined, a growing
body of genetic epidemiological data reveals the association
of distinct activating KIR in the pathogenesis of autoimmune
diseases. In these models, the activation signals are proposed
to prevail over HLA-dependent inhibition that presumably
exacerbates NK cell response [7]. Psoriasis vulgaris is a com-
mon inflammatory skin disorder that is strongly associated
with KIR2DS1 alone [81, 82] or in combination with
HLA-Cw6 [83]. A weak association of the activating re-
ceptor-ligand pair KIR2DS2:HLA-CAsn80
is observed in dia-
betes mellitus [84]. Additionally, the unusual genotype of
KIR2DS2 in the absence of its inhibitory counterpart
KIR2DL2 is found at high frequency in patients with scle-
roderma (12%) as compared with controls (2%) [85].
Genotypes encoding a dominant activating KIR genotypes
(increased number of activating KIR and less inhibitory
KIR-HLA combinations) is found to be associated with cer-
tain uveitis conditions including birdshot chorioretinopathy
(BCR) [86], Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease [87], and
HLA-B27-associated acute anterior uveitis (AAU) and axial
spondyloarthropathy [88].
TUMOR IMMUNITY
Elimination of NK cells in mice results in a higher in-
cidence of spontaneous tumors, impaired clearance of in-
oculated tumor cells, and an increased rate of tumor meta-
stasis [89]. A large body of evidence argues that enhancement
of NK cell numbers and function in human cancer patients
is associated with increases in tumor clearance and duration
of clinical remission [90]. KIR receptors seem to influence

malignancies, specifically those associated with viral
infections. The presence of KIR3DS1 is shown to be associated
with cervical neoplasia progression to cervical cancer, a tu-
mor that is strongly associated with human papilloma viruses
(HPV)-16/18 [91]. In contrast, KIR3DS1 and KIR2DS1 genes
are shown to protect from developing a severe form of re-
current respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), a rare disease of
the larynx and upper airway caused by another HPV strain,
HPV-6/11 [92]. The difference in clinical disease expression
induced by different HPV strains in 3DS1 carriers could
be the interaction of 3DS1 with putative HPV strain-specific
ligands leading to either killing of HPV-6/11-infected cells
keeping the host from developing RRP or leading to in-
appropriate tissue-specific hyperresponsiveness promoting
growth of cervical cancer, vs. benign respiratory papillomas.
HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL
TRANSPLANTATION (HCT)
Although NK cells have been known for more than 35
years to have natural ability to kill leukemia and lymphoma
cell in rodents [93, 94], their potential therapeutic use in
eliminating these hematological cancers in a clinical setting
was proposed in 1997 by Valiante and Parham [95].
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) transplantation has been
increasingly adopted as a therapy for a number of malignant
and nonmalignant hematologic diseases, including leukemia,
lymphoma, aplastic anemia, thalassemia major, immunode-
ficiency diseases, and severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID) [96-98]. Following allogeneic HSCT, the progeny
of the donor stem cells repopulate the entire hematopoietic
system of the recipient. The T cells of donor origin are
critical for promoting engraftment and eradicating malignant
cells, but may cause an adverse reaction such as graft rejection
and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which is an attack
on recipient tissues. To minimize T cell alloreactivity, HSCT
is performed with HLA-matched donors. An HLA-matched
donor can be KIR mismatched, since the KIR gene family
is not physically linked to HLA gene family. NK cells are
the first lymphocyte population to appear in peripheral blood
shortly after HSCT, and the KIR receptor repertoires of re-
constituted NK cells are consistently of donor type [99].
The donor-derived NK cells can be alloreactive, if their
inhibitory KIRs do not see a relevant HLA class I ligand
in the recipient that was present in the donor. Such allor-
eactive NK cells greatly contribute many potential benefits,
including i) decreased rates of GVHD, ii) decreased rates
of graft rejection mediated by NK lysis of host T cells, iii)
decreased relapse, iv) improved engraftment mediated by
NK-cell release of hematopoietic cytokines, and v) enhanced
immune reconstitution and decreased infectious complica-
tions mediated by NK-cell antiviral activity. Such beneficial
NK cell alloreactivity, which can be predicted from the differ-
ences in KIR-binding HLA class I ligands between donor
and recipient based on their HLA class I type, was first
described for HLA haploidentical transplantation by the use
of an extensively T cell-depleted graft in acute myeloid leuke-
mia (AML) patients [100] and later investigated in other
transplantation settings [101, 102]. Patients with myeloid
malignancies are more responsive to treatment than those
with lymphoid malignancies. Several studies have suggested
that adult acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) is not as suscep-
tible to KIR ligand mismatched haploidentical allogeneic
HSCT [100, 103-105]. However, alloreactive NK cell-medi-
ated effects can impact childhood ALL [106]. Beneficial ef-
fects from KIR-ligand mismatch have not been seen in the
T cell-replete setting [107, 108].
In addition to the recipient lacking HLA class I ligands
for the donor-derived NK cells, expression of activating KIR
receptors on donor NK cells is also shown to influence HSCT
outcome. Compared to donors with AA genotypes (express
one or no activating KIR), the Bx genotype (express 1-6
activating KIRs) donors are shown to contribute significantly
superior relapse protection and improved disease-free surviv-
al for AML patients [109]. Gene content motif analyses fur-
ther reveal that the centromeric and telomeric B hap-
lotype-specific motifs both contribute to relapse protection
and improved survival, but centromeric B homozygosity
(Cen-B/B) has the strongest independent effect [109]. Further
studies are required to determine if the clinical benefit con-
ferred by Cen-B/B is caused by a single KIR gene (such
as 2DS2, 2DS3 or KIR2DL2) or by the combination of specific
KIR genes.
Recent studies reveal the strongest clinical impact of telo-
meric B haplotype-specific activating KIR genes [110, 111].
Compared with KIR3DS1-negative donors, a donor with
KIR3DS1 is shown to be associated with lower-grade II-IV
acute GVHD, but not with relapse [110]. Furthermore, grade
II-IV acute GVHD, overall mortality, and transplantation-
related mortality all decreased as the number of copies of
donor KIR3DS1 increased, with the lowest failure rate occur-
ring among patients homozygous for donor KIR3DS1 [110].
Functional experiments reveal that the activating KIR2DS1
plays a substantial role in mediating alloreactivity and confers
an advantage in the ability of NK cell alloreactivity to kill
dendritic cells and T cell blasts [111]. In summary, knowing
the KIR genotype of the donor, and HLA types of both
the donor and recipient, it is possible to predict the degree
of KIR-HLA interactions that may determine an enhanced
ability to limit GVHD and improve engraftment for certain
leukemias.
CONCLUSIONS
Emerging understanding of KIR and MHC loci provides
new insights into their diversity between individuals, human
populations, and distinct species. NK cells are more than
simple innate killers and participate in adoptive immunity
to infections, cancer and transplantation. Interactions be-
tween the products of the independently segregating poly-
morphic KIR and HLA loci regulate NK cell effector function
in distinguishing unhealthy cell targets form the healthy

host cells. Although certain KIR-HLA compound genotypes
have been implicated in human disease, it is important to
develop studies to understand the impact of KIR and HLA
sequence variants, and their combinations on receptor-ligand
expression, recognition, development, signaling, effector
function, and impact on disease susceptibility and resistance.
Such sequence diversity studies must also be extended to
different ethnic populations to understand the natural se-
lection of KIR-HLA compound genotypes that might favor
population adaptation and survival. Further studies on the
functional characterization of the NK subsets expressing dis-
tinct KIR receptor repertoire at healthy and disease state
will be of great interest and may provide a better under-
standing of the NK tolerance and pathogenesis of disease.
Functional studies aiming to investigate the impact of varia-
ble KIR-HLA interactions on NK cell development, differ-
entiation, education, homeostasis, longevity, and functional
heterogeneity are essential to underpin their potential for
rational use in humans and optimizing the use of NK cells
for treatment of disease.
