THE PROPERTIES AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
RETICULOCYTE*
JAMES M. ORTEN
The discovery of the efficacy of liver and other tissue prepara-
tions in the treatment of pernicious anemia, has brought into promi-
nence the vital-staining erythrocyte, the reticulocyte. A knowledge
of fluctuations of these cells in the blood of pernicious anemia
patients has proved invaluable as an index to the success of the treat-
ment of this malady. Likewise, the diagnostic and prognostic value
of the information obtained from reticulocyte determinations in
certain other blood disorders is well known. The growing impor-
tance of the reticulocyte in modern medicine justifies a discussion of
the properties and significance of this blood constituent as well as of
the conditions influencing its normal and abnormal variations in the
organism.
Historical Sketch
The first description of the presence in red corpuscles of granular
material, possessing properties similar to those of the substance now
known as "reticular matter", was that of Erb,5 in 1865. The series
of observations which he made on blood treated with 1 per cent
acetic acid or with picric acid is surprisingly comprehensive and
accurate, even in the light of the present-day knowledge of the
reticulated erythrocyte. Granules were observed in the erythrocytes
of calves, of young cats, of human fetuses, and even of normal adult
animals. They were plentiful in the blood of man after hemorrhage
and in the erythrocytes of human patients with certain chronic dis-
eases, especially after iron therapy. The "granular" cells were
larger than normal erythrocytes. Erb erroneously regarded these
cells as transition forms between the white and red corpuscles. Pos-
sibly because of the crudeness of the technic employed, the fore-
going observations have seldom been referred to by subsequent
investigators in this field, and usually Ehrlich51 (1 881) is regarded

paper was prepared during the tenure of a National Research Council Fellowship
in Medicine, 1933-34.

as the first to observe the reticulated erythrocyte. He reported that
some of the erythrocytes in films made from the blood of pernicious
anemia patients contained material which stained a deep blue with
methylene blue, one of the basic dyes which was introduced in his
microchemical analysis of cells. He described the stained material
as . . . "feine, dichte und elegante Netze . . . die sich in gewissen
Farbstoffen intensiv tingiren". This observation, together with
suggestions of a possible clinical value of the reticulated erythro-
cyte69 stimulated a growing interest in the microchemical study
of blood cells by means of the basic dye procedure. Ehrlich's
observation was soon confirmed and extended by other German
investigators5' 6, 69, 75, 85, 94, 97, 132, 135, 152, 158, 171, 177, 185 Similar observa
tions were made in Italy26, 27, 57, 58, 66, in France28 100, 179, 216 and in
A&merica78, 88, 198, 209. The foregoing citations to work in this field
prior to 1910 indicate that there existed a substantial foundation for
the many investigations carried out in the next decade.
The wide-spread interest in studies of the granular erythrocyte,
together with the paucity of facts regarding the nature of the granu-
lar material soon led to some confusion in nomenclature. The
majority of the German and Italian investigators designated this cell
as "vitalfarbbaren Erythrocyte", "vitalgranulierten roten Blutzel-
len", or erythrocytes with "fadennetzstruktur" or "substantia-
granulofilamentosa". The French spoke of "hematies granuleux"
or "globules rouges granuleux", and the Americans used such terms
as "reticulated red cell" or "vital-staining erythrocyte". Subse-
quently the term "reticulocyte"115 met with increasing favor both in
this country and in Europe. Recently, the term "granulofilocyte"
has been introduced into the German literature142. Inasmuch as the
staining of the reticular material may be accomplished just as satis-
factorily after the death of the cell, the term "vital-staining erythro-
cyte" is looked upon with disfavor by some37 154,
An increase in the number of reticulocytes may be spoken of as
"reticulosis"1l5 or "reticulocytosis", and a lack as "reticulopenia"l.
Methods of Preparation
The characteristic granular or filamentous material within the
reticulocyte may be made visible by staining with certain basic dyes.
In addition to methylene blue5' the following have been used:
520
THE RETICULOCYTE
methyl green88, neutral red94, brilliant cresyl blue27, and malachite
green, gold orange, pyronin, eosin, toluidin blue, Azur I and II,
Unna's polychrome blue, naphthylene blue, Janus green B, thionin,
and cresyl violet (see references 27, 152, 158, 162, 191 ). Of these,
brilliant cresyl blue27 has proved to be the best'9' and is used almost
exclusively at the present time.
Numerous procedures for staining the reticulocyte have been
described. In evaluating the relative merits of the different meth-
ods, certain requisites of a satisfactory procedure should be kept in
mind, namely, the adequacy of the concentration of the dye and
the staining time, the uniformity of distribution, and the absence of
distortion of the cells. Two general methods of preparation, the
"fresh" or "wet" and the "permanent" or "dry", are commonly
employed. In the "wet" methods, the stained cells are examined
in suspension, either in the original plasma or in an isotonic saline
solution; in the "dry" methods the stained cells are spread in thin
films, dried, and usually fixed and counterstained before examination.
A variety of methods utilizing the "wet" procedure have been
described7 35, 94, 98, 103, 115, 158, 191, 209 including a modification, in which
the fluid suspension of stained cells is counted in the ordinary hemo-
cytometer chamber67 68. This modification has been criticized on the
grounds that with the degree of magnification employed the finer
forms of reticulocyte are difficultly seen48 103, 202
The "permanent" methods of preparation are probably used more
extensively today than are the "wet" methods because by these pro-
cedures one obtains films which may be kept indefinitely for repeated
enumeration and for comparison. Descriptions of "permanent"
methods are many (see references 2, 30, 32, 37, 78, 82, 157, 163,
183, 184, 191, 202, 216, 220, 224). The suggestion has been made
that slightly low values may be obtained on specimens prepared by
the permanent methods because of a decolorization of some of
the finer forms of reticulocyte during the process of fixation by
methyl alcohol'91. However, comparative studies202, as well as
comparisons of values reported in the literature on normal adult
human subjects, thus far have failed to reveal a constant significant
difference between the values obtained on the "fixed" and "fresh"
preparations.
The presence of a number of substances in the diluting fluid may
interfere with the staining of reticulocytes and thus lead to erroneous
results. Many soluble compounds80' 165 have a marked inhibitory
521
YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
effect, particularly certain sodium salts and dextrose80. This may
account for the poor staining of the blood of diabetics by methylene
blue (cited in 80). Variations in the pH of the staining mixture
may lead to an atypical appearance of the reticulocyte70.
Morphology
The reticulated erythrocyte when stained with brilliant cresyl
blue and examined with oil immersion magnification appears as a
pale greenish-blue disc containing the dark blue reticulum. The
reticulum may occur in the form of a dense central knot, a heavy
granular skein, a scanty granular skein, or as a few isolated filaments
or granules scattered diffusely through the cell. The most immature
of the reticulocytes exhibit the centrally-located, dense reticulum,
whereas the older forms show progressively less of the reticular sub-
stance and a more diffuse distribution. The reticulated erythro-
cytes are frequently classified into four or five groups depending on
the amount and distribution of the reticulum71' 82, 123, 191, 202. If the
film stained with brilliant cresyl blue is fixed and is counterstained
with one of the modified Romanowsky stains, the hemoglobin-con-
taining cytoplasm develops the characteristic pink color while the
reticulum retains the original deep blue. Excellent color plates
showing the different grades of reticulocytes, both in fresh and
in counterstained preparations, may be found in the paper of
Seyfarth191. Other splendid illustrations, some in color, may also be
found27' 78, 82,163,193, 202
Variations in the method of staining and the presence of certain
substances in the staining mixture may cause a marked alteration in
the form of the reticulum. A change in the pH of the staining mix-
ture toward the acid side results in a finely granular reticulum70,
whereas treatment with dilute alkali produces a stippled form183.
Exposure of the blood film to alcohol prior to staining with brilliant
cresyl blue'08 or drying at elevated temperatures18 changes the
appearance of the reticulum to a very fine and diffuse form, re-
sembling "polychromatophilia". The demonstration of all of
the various forms of the reticular substance has been accomplished
by varying the concentration of the dye in the staining fluid17 and
by the use of a special benzidine-alcohol technic31. The foregoing
522
THE RETICULOCYTE
observations are in accord with the conviction that reticulation,
obtained by staining with brilliant cresyl blue, and polychromato-
philia and stippling, found after methyl alcohol fixation and staining
with one of the Romanowsky stains, are merely different manifesta-
tions of the same substance'4 17, 18, 31, 78, 79, 108, 166, 183, 191
Reticulated red cells, when examined in fresh preparations by
dark-field illumination, contain a finely coiled network which may
be moved about freely with a micromanipulator'95. Even by dark-
field illumination, however, the reticulum must be stained before it
becomes visible37.
Origin of the Reticular Substance
The suggestions have been made that the reticulum may originate
as a result of some cellular degenerative process, that it may be an
artifact, a mitochondrial derivative, a nuclear remnant, or condensed,
primitive cytoplasm. The reticular substance was first regarded
as a degenerative material, a "coagulation necrosis"52, or a substance
produced by the action of certain deleterious agents on corpuscles75.
This view has received little support. Nor has the suggestion that
the reticular substance represents an artifact met with favor, chiefly
because of the constancy of its appearance in the erythrocytes of
normal subjects and in diseased patients without anemia, and also
because the reticular material does not increase upon standing209.
One investigatorl25 has described mitochondria in reticulocytes.
Key'08, however, has been unable to demonstrate the material and,
because of distinct differences in staining reactions, believes that the
reticulum is not of mitochondrial origin. Whereas a few investiga-
tors have believed that the reticulum is formed from the disintegrat-
ing nucleus3' 114, the preponderance of opinion favors the view that
the reticulum originates from the condensed primitive cytoplasm of
the parent erythroblast37' 57, 58, 69, 97, 108, 115, 163, 183, 191* This hypothe-
sis is supported by the following evidence37' 163: the staining reactions
of the reticular and nuclear material are not the same; the reticulum
appears regularly in nucleated erythrocytes with intact nuclei; under
ultraviolet illumination the reticular substance appears transparent,
whereas nuclear material is opaque. A final proof of the origin of
the reticulum, however, awaits further experimental facts.

Significance of the Reticulocyte
In contrast to the early postulate of Ehrlich52 that the reticulated
erythrocyte represented a degenerating corpuscle, and contrary to
the theory that the granular partides were concerned with the
clotting of the blood'48 188, the reticulocyte is at present regarded as
a young erythrocyte27' 37, 57, 108, 115, 159, 183, 191, 198 The current belief
concerning the role of the reticulocyte as a juvenile erythrocyte is
dearly expressed in the following quotation: "M.E. stellt die Sub-
stantia granulo-filamentosa einen konstanten Durchgangszustand,
eine morphologische Entwicklungsform im normalen Reifungs-
vorgang aller h-amoglobinhaltigen Blutzellen bei Mensch und Tier
dar."191 This view is illustrated in a diagram of the development
of the red blood corpuscle in Sabin's review178 and in Seyfarth's191
excellent color plate showing the various forms of reticulocytes.
The postulate that the reticulocyte is an immature erythrocyte
serves well as a working hypothesis for explaining variations in the
number of these cells in different physiological and pathological
conditions. Thus, a decreased need for erythrocytes is reflected in
a diminution of the reticulocyte count, whereas, given a normal
erythropoietic mechanism, an increased requirement is ordinarily met
by an increase in the juvenile forms. Furthermore, the intensity
of the increased demand is indicated by the augmented proportion of
younger reticulated forms released into the circulation. These
changes are analogous to the familiar "shift to the left" occurring
in leukocytes."7
Properties of the Reticulocyte
The reticulocyte exhibits certain characteristic properties which
serve to differentiate it from mature red cells. The average normal
reticulated erythrocyte is slightly larger than the mature red
corpusde38' 108, 168 the diameter averaging 8.6 microns compared with
7.6 microns for the mature erythrocyte 68. The reticulocyte has a"
lower specific gravity than has the mature corpuscle and, therefore,
will be found in the upper portion of a centrifugalized column of
cells108. This property must be borne in mind in the use of methods
of preparation employing a centrifuge technic. Reticulocytes tend
524
THE RETICULOCYTE
to agglutinate and to adhere to foreign particles'08. However,
reticulocytes are not agglutinated by serum which causes an aggluti-
nation of the mature erythrocytes89.
There exists a difference of opinion regarding the comparative
fragility of the reticulocyte and the mature erythrocyte in hypotonic
solutions. Some investigators believe that the juvenile form is the
more resistant105' 164, 196, 199, whereas others have detected no constant
difference20 108, 166, The reticulocyte is somewhat less susceptible to
destruction by heat92, but is probably no more resistant to hemolysis
by saponin than is the mature erythrocyte218. A recent report indi-
cates that the reticulocytes of rats are less readily infected by
Bartonella muris than are adult cells'67.
The fact that the immature erythrQcyte exhibits a definite oxygen
consumption, whereas the mature red cell requires little or none,
seems clearly demonstrated29' 33, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 77, 84, 144, 145, 176, 194, 211, 221,
222, In general, the investigators cited above agree that the oxygen
consumption of blood parallels the proportion of reticulated red cells
therein. Because of its own oxygen requirement, the reticulocyte
is probably a less valuable oxygen carrier than is the mature
erythrocyte41.
What is the length of life of the reticulocyte? Experiments in
which samples of blood containing reticulocytes were incubated
in vitro at 370 C. showed that a progressive decrease in the percent-
age of reticulated cells occurred up to 72 hours, at which time the
reticulated corpuscles had entirely disappeared'65. Similar results
have been obtained on samples of blood kept at 370 C. either in vitro
or in vivo in the pleural cavity of rabbits79. These investigators
observed further that the reticular material disappeared more
promptly from samples containing the more diffuse, older type of
reticulum than from the younger forms having the dense, centrally
located type. Four to 6 days elapsed before the reticulum com-
pletely disappeared from the samples containing the most immature
types of reticulocyte. This work has recently been confirmed84.
It appears, therefore, that the length of life of the human reticulo-
cyte under physiological conditions is about 4 to 6 days. Avian
reticulocytes may mature somewhat more rapidly223.
If samples of reticulocyte-containing blood are kept at tempera-
tures lower than 370 C., the rate of maturation is significantly de-
layed79' 84, 165. Reticulated erythrocytes have been found in samples
525
YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
of blood kept in the ice-box for 6 months79. The similarity between
the effect of temperature variations on the maturation of the reticulo-
cyte and on ordinary chemical reactions has been pointed out"'1.
Chemizcal Properties of the Reticulum
At the present time little is known of the chemical properties of
the reticulum. According to several investigators, the substance is
insoluble in water, methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, ether, chloroform,
and in acetic, picric, tannic, hydrochloric, and sulphuric acids6" 108, 191
It is soluble, however, in dilute alkali'08 183. The characteristic
affinity of the reticular material for basic dyes is indicative of an
acidic character61. When subjected to microchemical methods of
study, the reticulum gives negative tests for iron, inorganic phos-
phorus, and the hydroxyphenyl group (Millon's reagent)108. The
filamentous reticulum seen after staining may represent a previously
diffuse colloid precipitated within the erythrocyte by basic dyes18 227;
or the reticulum may consist of a protein-lipoid complex containing
free fatty acids"'; or it may be a derivative of hemoglobin81.
In contrast to the absence of nucleic acid phosphorus in mature
red cells, reticulocytes contain definite quantities of the organic phos-
phorus-containing substance'06 127. The amount of nucleic acid
phosphorus varies roughly with the percentage of reticulocytes.
Normal Values for Adult Man and Certain Animals
The proportion of reticulocytes in the blood of healthy adult
subjects of a particular species is maintained at a rather constant
value. Approximate mean reticulocyte values for a number of
species, together with the range of values reported by various investi-
gators, are given in Table I. The "mean values" given for the
different species (Table I) represent an approximation obtained by a
carefully considered survey of the available data. Because of the
extreme variations found in the data from certain species, or because
of the few or uncertain numbers of subjects employed, the actual
arithmetical mean would have yielded in some cases values entirely
inconsistent with the findings of the majority of investigators.

The decided differences in the reticulocyte values of normal
adults of various species merit further comment. The average
figures for the larger mammals, man and dog for example, are sig-
nificantly lower than those of the smaller mammals, the rat and
mouse. The fact that nearly all of the nucleated erythrocytes of
certain lower vertebrates (birds, frogs, fish, and reptiles) show the
reticulum is of singular interest.
Physiological Variations
The percentage of reticulocytes in the blood of man and of other
species may undergo profound alterations under various physio-
logical conditions. Such a change occurs with age. The blood of
the embryo shows an extremely high proportion of reticulated
erythrocytes, varying from 6.4 to 50 per cent in human em-
bryos36 87, 111, 191. The values tend to decrease with the age of the
527
I
YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
embryo and at birth human subjects show an average of about 5
per cent, the reported range varying from 0.1 to 11 per cent25' 27,
36, 68, 74, 78, 87, 104, 111, 115, 191, 193, 209 Premature infants show slightly
higher counts, 5 to 30 per cent19' 193. 209. After birth the human
reticulocyte level decreases rapidly, reaching the adult level of
approximately 0.8 per cent within one or two weeks25' 117. Similar
age variations have been reported for other species. The erythro-
cytes of rat'9' and mouse'93 embryos are nearly all reticulated. At
birth 20 to 40 per cent of the erythrocytes of dogs show reticula-
tion191. Similar values for rabbits and guinea pigs have been
reported191, while those for rats56' 191, 197, 200 and mice'93 are signifi-
cantly higher. The reticulocyte level of the rat reaches adult values
at 50 to 70 days of age'28' 156, 197, 200, and in the mouse at about 30
days of age'93.
The possibility of differences referable to sex in the reticulocyte
count of man has not been extensively investigated. The data re-
ported in a recent article202 indicate that women may have a slightly
higher count. According to several investigators, pregnancy in
human subjects is accompanied by a slight reticulosis56' 68, 74 191 226
An increase in polychromatophilia in the rat during pregnancy and
lactation, and fluctuations during various phases of the estrual cycle
have been described53.
A suggestion that there may occur a seasonal variation in the
reticulocyte count of man is found in the observation that slightly
higher average counts are obtained in the spring months than in
the winter68. Frogs apparently exhibit a marked seasonal reticulo-
cyte variation, the summer values greatly exceeding those found in
the spring190. Temperature changes may be involved in the fore-
going alleged seasonal variations, inasmuch as an increase in the
environmental temperature causes a significant increase in the propor-
tion of reticulated erythrocytes in rats and mice75 and in man63' 64, 74.
The fact that physical exertion does not cause a release of nucle-
ated erythrocytes into the circulation even in dogs with hyperplastic
marrow46 indicates that exercise probably does not greatly affect the
reticulocyte level. However, the possibility exists that exercise may
promote a slight increase in the more mature forms of reticulocyte,
inasmuch as an unmistakable rise in erythrocytes with single refractile
granules has been described90. This cell is regarded as the final
developmental form of the immature erythrocyte90.
Changes in oxygen tension may produce pronounced alterations
in the reticulocyte count. Experiments on rats and certain other
528
THE RETICULOCYTE
species show clearly that a reduction in oxygen tension stimu-
lates a prompt increase in the proportion of reticulated erythro-
cytes21 74 105, 191, whereas an increase in oxygen tension produces a
decreasel, 2. These experiments suggest the possibility that the
tension of oxygen in the blood may play an important role in regulat-
ing the proportion of reticulocytes in peripheral blood. However,
attention has been directed to the fact that the anoxemia occurring
during the crisis of pneumonia does not evoke a reticulosis"13.
Whether or not such physiological states as sleep or vigorous
digestion alter the reticulocyte count apparently has not been
investigated.
Variations in Pathological Conditions
The finding of reticulated erythrocytes in the blood of
patients with pernicious anemia5' and the suggestion that the
determination of these forms might be of clinical value69 have
led to studies of the fluctuations of the reticulocytes in disease.
A number of excellent publications have dealt with this general
problem34' 36, 37, 68, 74, 75, 78, 115, 117, 191, 226
The two general principles which appear to govern the propor-
tion of reticulocytes in various diseases have been concisely stated
by Krumbhaar'15: "Variations in the reticulocyte percentage in dis-
ease naturally depend on the intensity of the demand and the
capacity of the bone marrow to respond." Thus, in those diseases
in which there exists an anemia the reticulocyte count will be high
and in direct proportion to the severity of the anemia, provided that
the bone marrow is functionally capable of response and that suffi-
cient hematogenic material is available. A convincing substantiation
of this view has been obtained in studies on the reticulocyte response
following liver therapy in pernicious anemia. When the missing
hemopoietic substance, contained in liver and other tissues, is given
the reticulocyte level attained is directly proportional to the
erythrocyte count existing at the time therapy is started. So
close is this relationship that it has been expressed as an algebraic
equation'3 138, 141, 172 by means of which the reticulocyte value to be
reached after adequate therapy can be accurately predicted from the
initial erythrocyte count. A low percentage of reticulocytes in the
face of a severe anemia is indicative of either a functionally inactive
marrow or a lack of hematogenic material. In general, clinical
studies, which have been briefly summarized in Table II, have sub-
stantiated this postulate.

THE RETICULOCYTE
As is true in cases of human anemia, the observed variations in
the proportion of reticulocytes in certain experimental anemias corre-
spond quite closely to changes in the hemoglobin and erythrocyte
levels. High reticulocyte counts are encountered in the anemias
following the administration of phenylhydrazine37 71 99, 110, 181, 221, 222,
acetylphenylhydrazine95 131, toluylendiamine189, intravenously in-
jected water99, lead17 19, 68, 74, 75, 78
or mercuriy68 A prompt reticu-
losis occurs a few days following experimental hemorrhage, the
degree of the reticulocyte rise varying with the severity of the
anemia95 99 121, 128, 153, 173, 175, 191. However, in chronic hemorrhagic
anemia, the reticulocyte level appears to fall close to the normal
limits, after progressively decreasing from the initial high value121 173
In contrast to the reticulosis which occurs in experimental
anemias, a decrease in reticulocytes is found subsequent to the pro-
duction of plethora in normal dogs and rabbits by the repeated
injection of blood16' 116, 174* Likewise, there occurs a decrease in the
proportion of reticulated erythrocytes in human patients following
blood transfusions'36 170, 210
Response in Various Experimental Conditions
The discovery that adequate liver therapy produces a prompt
reticulosis in human subjects with pernicious anemia has stimulated
interest in this type of investigation. The large variety of experi-
mental conditions under which reticulocyte studies have been made
is evident from the investigations cited in Table III.
Although considerable progress has been made in determining
the nature of the substance present in certain tissue preparations
capable of producing a remission in pernicious anemia, progress in
this direction has been seriously retarded by the lack of a test subject
other than human patients. Obviously, a satisfactory laboratory
method for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of possible hemo-
poietic agents is urgently needed. 'With this in view, the reticulo-
cyte response has been determined following liver administration to
normal subjects, including man212, rats206, and pigeons49' 50, 149, 207, 217
The results obtained in the first two species have been uniformly
negative, and in the latter the variability and lack of specificity of
the response217 renders doubtful the suitability of the pigeon as a
hemopoietic test subject.

The foregoing discussion emphasizes the fact that whereas
many fundamental details regarding the nature and properties
of the reticulocyte have accumulated, much more information is
needed. Granting that the reticulocyte is an immature erythrocyte,
questions concerning various aspects of its composition and the
changes involved in its maturation still remain. Not until a satis-
factory solution to these and related problems is obtained will the
knowledge of the reticulocyte be complete.
