Background/Aims: The current study was designed to determine whether the indoor air pollution in a hemodialysis
room (HD) was different from that of other comparable areas in a hospital.
Methods: Five air monitor samplers were hung on the ceiling and placed on the table in both the HD and general
ward nursing stations, respectively. In addition, five samplers were placed in the nurse’s breathing zone of the HD and
the general ward, respectively. Ten air monitor samplers were also placed on the edge of the bed in the HD, which
represented the patient’s breathing zone. The levels of benzene and toluene were analyzed by GC/MS.
Results: In the general ward, the toluene concentration was significantly higher in the nurse breathing zone than that
for the ceiling or table samples (p=0.001). The benzene concentration was also significantly higher in the general ward
nurse breathing zone than that in the HD (p=0.006). In addition, the benzene concentrations on the table were higher
at the general ward as compared to the HD (p=0.028), but there was no significant difference between the ceiling,
general ward station and HD.
Conclusions: Both the benzene and toluene concentrations in the HD appear to be more affected by the outdoor
atmospheric conditions than by any potential indoor internal sources.

INTRODUCTION
Volatile organic compounds (VOC) are comprised of 3 major
components: aliphatic hydrocarbons (chloroform, carbon tetrachl-
oride), petroleum products (gasoline, mineral oil) and aromatic
hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylene)
1)
.
Among the VOCs, aromatic hydrocarbons are widely used as
industrial solvents and dry cleaning agents in the rubber and
shoe industries and for printing and paper-coating
2)
.
The chemicals in this category are readily absorbed through
the lungs, skin and gastrointestinal tract, which can cause
headaches, dizziness and liver or kidney toxicity. Furthermore,
there is concern about their potential carcinogenicity and adverse
reproductive effects at low levels of exposure
3)
.
Despite the wide distribution of ambient air pollutant VOC
sources, the indoor VOC concentrations may be the dominant
contributor to personal exposure given that most people spend
a large portion of their time indoors
4)
.
The numerous indoor sources for VOCs in a typical residence
or building, as well as the contribution from airborne outdoor
inflow, result in a wide range of indoor VOCs. Measurement of
VOCs in the indoor environment has received substantial
research attention during the recent years because the indoor
VOC levels may pose potential negative health effects to the
occupants
5-10)
.
The Korean Journal of Internal Medicine: Vol. 23, No. 3, September 2008112
The concentrations of indoor VOCs can be affected by
outdoor atmospheric conditions, the indoor sources that
generate VOCs, the indoor volume, the activities of people,
removal by reactions, the ventilation rates and seasonal factors.
Furthermore, the concentrations of indoor VOCs can vary due to
chemical reactions in the presence of ozone, temperature
changes and different levels of humidity.
There are many kinds of rooms in a general hospital such as
general wards, outpatient clinics, intensive care rooms and
hemodialysis (HD) rooms. Among these, the HD rooms have
aroused special interest.
In general, HD rooms share many common environmental
characteristics. First, the HD machines are compactly arranged
in a given space for convenience (a short distance is required
between the beds and the nurse station). Second, HD machines
continuously run about 10-15 hours a day according to the
number of HD sessions. Third, the dialyzer and associated
tubing systems are made of polyflux S, soft and rigid
polyvinylchloride, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, high density
polyethylene, polyester and rubber (Gambro Dialysatoren,
Hechingen, Germany), and all this is opened to the room air at
the end of each HD session. Fourth, the HD room temperature
is kept relatively higher than most other rooms in the hospital
because the patients on HD usually have cold intolerance
11, 12)
.
For this reason, the ventilation of the HD room is done not by
opening windows, but by a closed air condition control system.
Therefore, the air pollution in an HD room may greatly differ
from various other clinical settings
13)
.
Those patients with end-stage renal disease and who are on
HD usually stay in a HD room 15-18 hours a week through their
lives
14)
. The indoor air pollutants of a HD room may affect the
health of not only the patients on HD, but also the medical
teams working in the HD room.
This study is designed to compare the VOC concentrations in
a HD room with those VOC concentrations of other various
clinical settings in a hospital.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Two target VOCs (benzene and toluene) were chosen for
analysis because of their potential to cause adverse health
effects and for making comparison with the prior research. The
VOCs were measured using a passive sampler, that is, a 3M
organic vapor monitor #3500 (www.3M.com/occsafety).
A total of forty passive air samplers were placed in a HD
room and in a nearby nursing room of a general ward for 72
hours from May 29 to May 31, 2006 in Soonchunhyang
Cheonan Hospital. Five air samplers were hung on the ceilings
and placed on the top of tables in both the HD room and the
nursing stations that were nearby, but outside the HD room. Five
samples were taken from the breathing zone (using a badge on
the suit collar) of the nurses in both the HD room and in the
general ward (the same ward where the ceiling and table air
samplers were placed) during the same study period.
In the general ward nursing station, the duty nurse passed
the air samplers to the next duty nurse so that the samplers
were worn without interruption for 72 hours.
In the HD room, because the nurse’s duties were completed
by 10 PM, the air samplers were placed on top of a table in the
nurses’ station until the next morning at 7 AM when the next
nurse began their duty for the first session of HD. When nurses
left their station for various reasons (i.e., meal time, going to the
toilet, etc.), they detached their sampler badge and placed it on
their station table.
In the same way, ten samplers were placed on the edge of
the bed in the HD rooms to represent the breathing zone for the
patients who underwent HD (within 30 cm from the nose of the
patient, who was in the supine position). During the 72 hours
period, the beds were occupied by the HD patient for 45-48
hours.
During the sampling period, the temperature was recorded to
be between 26～28.5℃ in the HD room and between 25.5～
28.0℃ in the ward station. The humidity was recorded as
between 31～35% in the HD room and between 29～30% at
the ward station.
The main building of the hospital was built in 1981 (25yrs old)
and the HD room was remodeled 12 months before the start of
the study. In order to get into the HD room from the outside, a
person had to pass through 4 separate doors. There were two
doors between the outer door and the ward nurse station in the
general ward. The ward nurse’s station was located at the
entrance of the corridor and the air flow was practically
uninhibited between the outside and the nurse station by the
doors because so many people passed through the doors.
There were 18 rooms for the patients on both sides of a
corridor and there was another door between the room and the
corridor.
The total space of the renal unit was 306 m
2
, of which 198
m
2
comprised the HD room. Twenty-eight HD machines (23
GAMBRO, 5 FMC) with the same number of beds were evenly
installed in the HD room. One side of the HD room faced toward
the outside air, but the windows were usually closed during the
HD section. The average time the windows were open for
ventilation was less than 30 minutes during the 72 hour period.
One hundred one patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD)
regularly underwent hemodialysis for 15～18 hours a week. Their
demographic characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
All the air samplers were analyzed at the same laboratory.
Our method for sample analysis has been described previously

15). In brief, the passive samplers were desorbed by adding 1.5
mL of carbon disulfide and then the samplers were agitated; we
allowed the badges to be desorbed for 30～45 minutes. The
desorbate was then sealed into auto-sampler vials and it was
analyzed by GC/MS. The GC oven was programmed to maintain
the temperature at 60℃ for 2.5 minutes, followed by heating at
100℃ for 30min, and finally heating at 50℃/min to 200℃ when
the temperature was held for 1min.
The desorption efficiencies were taken from the 3M literature
that came with the sampler. The samplers were shipped to the
laboratory by field researchers. Half the limit of detection (LOD)
for each compound was used for the analyses of the samples in
which a certain compound was not detected.
Statistics: All the data was expressed as means with standard
deviations. Statistical analysis was performed using the ANOVA
test to test the differences between 3 or 4 groups, and t-tests
was used to compare the data between two groups. p values
<0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS
There was no significant difference in the benzene
concentrations in the HD room between the ESRD patient’s
breathing zone (13.3±7.9 g/m
3
), the nurse breathing zone
(13.7±7.4 g/m
3
), the ceiling (19.4±2.6 g/m
3
), and the table
samples (12.8±6.9 g/m3
) (p=0.617). The benzene concentration
in the general ward’s nurse station was 20.1±3.4 g/m
3
for the
nurse breathing zone, it was 19.2±8.6 g/m
3
for the ceiling and
21.2±8.0 g/m
3
for the table (p=0.204). The benzene concen-
tration of the nurse breathing zone was significantly higher in the
general ward as compared to the HD room (p=0.006) (Figure 1).
Also, the benzene concentration on the table was higher in the
general ward station as compared to that of the HD room
(p=0.028) (Figure 1), but there was no significant difference in
the ceiling benzene concentration, as compared to the general
ward station and HD room.
The toluene concentrations in the HD room was 16.1±8.9
g/m
3
for the ESRD patient breathing zone, it was 23.3±3.0 g/m
3
for the nurse breathing zone, 17.1±1.4 g/m
3
for the ceiling and
17.8±6.9 g/m
3
on the table (p<0.05, ANOVA test) (Figure 1).
However, the toluene concentration was significantly higher in
the nurse breathing zone (35.0±4.7 g/m
3
) as compared to that

of both the ward’s ceiling (14.9±4.0 g/m
3
) and table
(15.9±2.4 g/m
3
) (p=0.001) (Figure 2).
The toluene concentration of the nurse breathing zone was
also significantly higher in the general ward’s nurse stations as
compared to that in the HD room (p=0.01, Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
Benzene is used widely not only as a solvent, but also for
synthesizing chemicals. Its major acute toxicity primarily affects
the central nervous system, while chronic exposure is known to
cause leukemia or aplastic anemia with exposure to as little as
1 ppm in the atmosphere
16)
. Toluene has replaced benzene as
a solvent because it does not produce leukemia or aplastic
anemia, although it is known to cause central nervous system
depression
17)
.
Contrary to our expectation, the toluene concentration
(p=0.01), and the benzene concentration (p=0.006) of the nurse
breathing zone were significantly higher at the general ward
nurse station than in the HD room. Also, the benzene
concentration in the table sample was higher at the general
ward station than that of the HD room (p=0.028).
These findings imply that indoor air pollutant VOCs in the HD
room are not worse than that of other rooms in the same
building, and this despite the many potential risk factors in a HD
room (the compact arrangement, the long running time of the
HD machines, exposure of the dialyzers and the associated
tubing systems, which are made of polyflux S, polyvinylchloride,
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, high density polyethylene,
polyester and rubber, to the room air and the relative high
temperature and humidity in the HD room).
Basically, the indoor VOC concentrations are multifactorial and
they are the result of outdoor airborne inflow, a wide variety of
potential indoor sources of VOCs and the ventilation and/or
purification system that’s used for the indoor air of the building.
In the same way, the VOCs concentration in the HD room would
be under the influence of the outdoor concentration, the indoor
sources of VOCs and the ventilation system of the HD room.
It is well known that the outdoor VOC concentrations in a
metropolitan zone of a large city are high due to the high traffic
volume, industrialization and crowded habitation
18)
. The purpose
of our study was to see whether the VOC concentrations were
higher in the HD room as compared to other similar rooms in
the same hospital building (the outdoor VOC concentrations
were not focused on in the current study). In our previous study,
the ambient out door air concentrations of benzene and toluene
were 21.6±11.8 g/m
3
and 18.1±14.1 g/m
3
, and respectively,
these were relatively lower levels in HD rooms than those of the
capital city Seoul (benzene: 39.8±77.1 g/m
3
, toluene: 147.8±
179.4 g/m
3
)
15)
.
The sampling device in the current study was designed to
measure the average concentrations of certain VOCs over a
measured time interval. It can be used for monitoring either
personal or an area. For monitoring a person, it is normally worn
near the breathing zone of an individual who is exposed to
potentially hazardous environments. When it is used as an area
monitor, it may be placed on walls, corners, table tops or other
regions where the air movement in the room may be limited. In
our study, we hung the sampling devices on the ceiling and we
placed them on table tops. There was no significant difference
noted between these two sampled areas.
However, both the benzene and toluene concentrations were
higher in the nurse breathing zone samples. We believe that this
Moon-Soo Kang, et al: Volatile organic compounds in a hemodialysis room 115
was due to the nurses traveling into several rooms along the
corridor where the VOC concentrations may have been higher.
VOCs may be present at concentrations that are not
considered actually harmful to human health. However, because
the lack of a precise cut-off value that’s known to be safe,
carefully monitoring VOC concentrations is required, and
especially in a room inhabited by patients with multiple
comorbidities, such as those patients on HD.
In conclusion, both the benzene and toluene concentrations in
the HD room were not significantly higher as compared to other
rooms in the same building. This finding suggests that both the
benzene and toluene concentrations in a HD room are more
dependent on the outdoor atmospheric conditions and they are
less affected by indoor sources. Ventilating a HD room would be
better performed by a centralized air conditioning system rather
than by opening windows, and especially when the hospital is
located in an outdoor environment with known high levels of
VOCs.
