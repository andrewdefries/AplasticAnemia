Abstract
Background: Tuberculous infections in patients with hematological disorders and hematopoietic
stem cell transplant vary in incidence, complications and response to treatment.
Methods and materials: A retrospective study of patients with various benign and malignant
hematological disorders and recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant who were treated at
Riyadh Armed Forces Hospital, Saudi Arabia between January 1991 and December 2002 and who
developed tuberculous infections was conducted.
Results: Tuberculous infections occurred in eighteen patients with hematological disorders and
hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The main associated factors were: reduced immunity due to
the primary hematological disorder, age more than 50 years and the administration of cytotoxic
chemotherapy, steroids or radiotherapy. These infections frequently involved the lungs and
predominantly occurred in males and in patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders,
myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. In patients treated with intravenous
cytotoxic chemotherapy, tuberculous infections tended to occur earlier and also tended to be
more disseminated compared to infections occurring in patients treated with oral chemotherapy.
Anti-tuberculous treatment was given to 16 patients and it was successful in 15 of these patients.
Conclusion: Tuberculous infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in patients with
various hematological disorders and in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The early
administration of anti-tuberculous therapy and compliance with drug treatment are associated with
successful outcomes while delayed management, drug resistance and the presence of miliary
infections are associated with poor prognosis and high mortality rates.

Introduction
Tuberculous infections (TIs) are serious and life-threaten-
ing complications in patients with malignant hematolog-
ical disorders and in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell
transplant (HSCT) [1-7]. Reactivation of latent tuberculo-
sis (TB) may be induced by the administration of cyto-
toxic chemotherapy and high dose corticosteroid therapy
[1,3,4,8]. A high index of suspicion should be maintained
in immunocompromised individuals presenting with
clinical and radiological manifestations compatible with
TIs [6,7,9-16]. At times, an empirical anti-tuberculous
therapy should be employed to prevent further clinical
deterioration and a possible lethal outcome that may be
associated with delayed diagnosis and late institution of
treatment [17].
The efficacy of anti-TB chemotherapy in patients with
hematological malignancies and in recipients of HSCT is
well documented [4,9]. However, drug resistance, non-
compliance with medications and the presence of
advanced and miliary forms of tuberculosis remain real
challenges [4,18,19].
This retrospective analysis of TIs in immunocompromised
hosts living in endemic areas was performed to explore
the incidence, the complications of these infections and
their response to treatment.
Methods and materials
Riyadh Armed Forces Hospital is a tertiary care center
comprising 1200 beds with specialty services including:
intensive care, hematology/oncology as well as solid
organ and HSCT. A retrospective study was conducted
between January 1991 and December 2002. The medical
records and the microbiological data of patients with
benign and malignant hematological disorders and recip-
ients of HSCT who developed TIs were reviewed.
Mantoux test
Injection of 0.1 ml of tuberculin solution intradermally.
The test is read at 48 to 72 hours. A positive result is indi-
cated by an induration of at least 10 mm in diameter.
Results
During the study period (12 years), 18 patients developed
TIs. Twelve were males and 6 were females with a male :
female ratio of 2:1. The median age of the patients was
48.5 years (range 19 to 75 years). The predominant pri-
mary hematological disorders were: chronic myeloprolif-
erative disorders (6 patients), acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) (4 patients) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
(3 patients) (Table 1). During the study period, TIs devel-
oped in: 4 out of 128 patients with AML treated at our
institution (incidence: 3.1%); 3 out of 51 patients with
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (5.9%); 3 out of 41
patients with MDS (7.3%); 1 out of 25 patients with
severe aplastic anemia (SAA) (4%); 1 out of 10 patients
with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) (10%); 1 out of 12

patients with essential thrombocythemia (8.3%); 1 out of
13 patients with polycythemia rubra vera (7.7%); 1 out of
14 patients with multiple myeloma (7.1%); 1 out of 16
patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma (6.3%) and 1 out of
36 patients with thrombocytopenic purpura (2.8%). No
single TI was encountered in any of the 109 patients with
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or in the 22 patients
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated at our
institution during the study period (Table 1). The main
associated factors for the development of TIs were:
reduced immunity due to the primary hematological dis-
ease, age more than 50 years and the administration of
cytotoxic chemotherapy or steroid treatment (Table 2).
Isolates from 10 patients were identified as M. tuberculosis.
The M. tuberculosis isolates were sensitive to the first line
drugs [rifampicin, isoniazid (INH), pyrizinamide and
ethambutol] except one isolate which was multidrug
resistant. The diagnoses of TIs were confirmed in the 10
patients who had positive cultures. In the remaining 8
patients, the diagnoses of TIs were made on an empirical
basis ie having clinical (weight loss, fever, malaise, sweat-
ing, chronic cough etc) and radiological (pulmonary
fibrosis, cavitation, calcification or nodular shadows)
manifestations strongly suggestive of TIs. Three of these
patients had histological changes (granuloma formation
with or without caseation necrosis on biopsies taken from
lymph nodes, bone marrow or muscle) compatible with
TB and 2 other patients had positive TB serology (high
IgM antibody levels). All the 8 patients in whom the diag-
noses of TIs were not confirmed by positive cultures had
positive mantoux tests and all of them had clinical
responses to the anti-TB chemotherapy. Those findings
strongly supported the diagnoses of TIs in these 8 patients
(Table 1).
Anti-TB treatment was given to 16 patients. In 2 patients,
no anti-TB chemotherapy was administered as in one of
these patients the diagnosis of TB was established after his
death and the other patient unfortunately lost follow up
at our institution. Out of the 16 treated patients, 15
patients were successfully treated and 13 of them were
compliant with the treatment (Table 1). In one patient,
anti-TB chemotherapy failed to control the infection due
to having a multidrug resistant organism. In the patients
who had pulmonary or disseminated TIs, 4 anti-TB drugs
were employed and the treatment was given for a total
duration of 12 months. However, in patients having local-
ized disease eg lymphadenopathy: 3 anti-TB drugs were
given for a total duration of 9 months. Anti-TB chemo-
therapy was given according to the sensitivity testing in
the patients who had positive TB cultures. In the patient
who had drug resistance, the treatment was modified
according to sensitivity results. INH chemoprophylaxis
was successful in preventing the reactivation of TIs in 5
patients, 2 of them had HSCT done. These 5 patients had
developed TIs after establishing the diagnoses of their
hematological disorders and they had been treated with
anti-tuberculous chemotherapy, then they were given
INH chemoprophylaxis to prevent the reactivation of
their old TIs as they susequently received further courses
of cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or HSCT in order to con-
trol/cure their hematological disorders. Forteen patients
presented with pyrexial illnesses while 4 patients had no
pyrexia at presentation. No cardiac or adrenal involve-
ment was reported in any of the patients studied.
Eleven patients had received steroids or cytotoxic chemo-
therapy to treat their primary hematological disorders. In
the 6 patients who had received IV cytotoxic chemother-
apy (idarubicin, cytosine arabinoside, cyclophospha-
mide): TIs occurred at a median time of 3 months after the
last course of chemotherapy given and at a median time
of 11.5 months from the date of the diagnosis of the pri-
mary hematological disorder. In the 5 patients who had
received oral chemotherapy group (hydroxyurea and ster-
oids); TIs occurred at a median time of 3 months after the
last course of chemotherapy given and at a median time
of 35 months from the date of the diagnosis of the pri-
mary hematological disorder. Disseminated TB infections
were encountered in three patients (50%) in the IV chem-
otherapy group of patients and only in one patient (20%)
belonging to the oral chemotherapy group.
The diagnoses of TIs were made after the diagnoses of the
primary hematological disorder in 12 patients, both TIs

and the primary hematological disorder were diagnosed
simultaneously in 5 patients while in 1 patient the TI was
diagnosed when the patient presented with anemia and
monoclonal gammopathy 2 years before the diagnosis of
the primary hematological disorder (multiple myeloma).
In the subgroup of patients in whom TIs were diagnosed
after the diagnoses of the primary hematological disease,
the diagnoses of TIs were made at a median time of 15
months after the diagnoses of the primary hematological
disorder.
The blood indices of the study patients at the presentation
of the TIs were as follows: pancytopenia (leucopenia:
white cell count < 4 Ã 109/L, anemia: hemoglubin < 11 g/
dL and thrombocytopenia: platelet count < 150 Ã 109/L)
was seen in 5 patients (27.8%); normal, anemia or mixed
blood picture in 4 patients each (22.2%) and thrombocy-
topenia in 1 patient (5.6%). The chest radiographic
appearances at the presentation of TIs were as follows:
areas of pulmonary consolidation consistent with pneu-
monia were seen in 10 patients (55.6%); fine reiculonod-
ular shadows consistent with pulmonary fibrosis in 7
patients (38.9%); calcification, pleural effusions or lymph
node enlargement in 3 patients each (16.7%) and basal
atelectasis, cavity formation or miliary shadows in 1
patient each (5.6%). However, the chest radiographs were
found to be normal in 3 patients (16.7%).
TIs occurred in 5 out of 103 patients with a variety of
benign and malignant hematological disorders who
received HSCT at our institution during the study period.
In 2 of these patients, TIs occurred before the HSCT and in
the other 3 patients, TIs occurred after the HSCT. The inci-
dence of TIs in HSCT patients at our institution was 2.9%.
All the three patients who developed TIs after receiving
HSCT had AML, all received IV cytotoxic chemotherapy
(cytosine arabinoside and idarubicin), all were given total
body irradiation and cyclophosphamide conditioning
therapy prior to the HSCT, all developed graft versus host
disease (GVHD) treated with steroid therapy and all had
pulmonary involvement (Table 3). Two HSCT patients
had primary TIs. In both patients; the initial clinical, radi-
ological and microbiological screenings for TB at the pres-
entations of their primary hematological disorders were
negative. One other patient had reactivation of an old TB
infection one year following a successful HSCT. This
patient had pulmonary TB diagnosed at the time of the
diagnosis of her AML. After treating both the AML and the
pulmonary TB, the patient had a successful allograft that
was complicated by an acute then a chronic GVHD that
were treated with steroids. Two of the HSCT patients had
positive TB cultures and in the third patient, TI was diag-
nosed empirically. Anti-TB chemotherapy was successful
in the 2 patients who received it. It was noticable that
none of the 52 allogeneic HSCT recipients having primary
hematological disorders other than AML ie patients hav-
ing disorders such as SAA, MDS, ALL developed TIs. It was
also noted that TIs were not encountered in recipients of
other forms of HSCT eg autologous grafts (21 patients).
Discussion
Infection is a serious complication in patients with malig-
nant hematological disorders [15]. The prevalence of TB
in patients with hematological malignancies ranges
between 2.1 and 2.6% [17]. Clinically evident TB can
antedate malignancy, both may present simultaneously or
TB may develop after the treatment of the malignant dis-
orders [3,8]. The average time between the completion of
cytotoxic chemotherapy and the development of TB is 18
to 20 months [3,4]. Persistent pyrexia in patients with
malignant hematological disorders, in remission, may
serve as a diagnostic marker for TB [14]. Difficulties in
establishing the diagnosis of TB can be partially explained
by the limitations of most of the existing diagnostic meth-
ods [17]. The bacteriological, the histological and the new

molecular diagnostic techniques should be employed in
patients suspected to have TB [15,17].
There is an association between TB and HCL [5]. In such
patients, TB is characterized by the presence of few pulmo-
nary symptoms, scarce microbiological findings and a
miliary distribution [5]. In patients with chronic myelo-
proliferative disorders, the incidence of TB is high and the
infection is usually disseminated [2]. In the patients stud-
ied, the incidence of TIs was relatively high in those hav-
ing chronic myeloproliferative disorders, MDS, AML and
SAA. In the patients who received steroids or cytotoxic
chemotherapy, TIs occurred at a median time of 3 months
from the last course of therapy given. In the 6 patients
who had chronic myeloproliferative disorders, dissemi-
nated TI was found in 1 patient only and positive cultures
and histology were encountered in 3 of these patients.
The increased utilization of anti-neoplastic agents in the
treatment of acute leukemia is associated with an increase
in the incidence of opportunistic infections, eg M. tubercu-
losis, that may be complicated by systemic dissemination
and multiorgan failure [1]. TB should also be considered
as a possible cause of hepatosplenic abscesses during the
prolonged periods of neutropenia following the courses
of cytotoxic chemotherapy given for patients with acute
leukemia in the areas that are endemic for TB [20]. Once
anti-TB treatment is instituted, a successful outcome can
be achieved in up to 90% of patients although a lethal
outcome has been reported in patients with miliary TB
[4]. All of our 4 patients with acute leukemia who devel-
oped TIs had AML and all had pulmonary involvement as
well as positive cultures or histology.
TB is a serious and a life threatening infectious complica-
tion which may cause fatal sepsis and a rapidly progressive
illness in recipients of HSCT [6,7]. TB is relatively rare
(incidence 0.6â2.7%) in HSCT patients despite their
severely immunocompromised state [6,7,10-13,21-23].
TB occurs mainly in recipients of T-cell depleted alloge-
neic grafts and in patients developing GVHD [21]. The
slow growth of the organism can lead to a late diagnosis
and a delay in the institution of treatment [10]. A high
index of suspicion as well as pre and post-transplant fol-
low up are required in countries where TB is common
[6,10,22]. TB should also be considered in the differential
diagnosis of unexplained infections in recipients of HSCT
[7,11]. Pre-transplant chest radiographic abnormalities
suggesting TB should be carefully evaluated [12]. GVHD
significantly increases the morbidity and the mortality
related to the pulmonary complications in HSCT recipi-
ents [23]. Rapidly progressive TIs and miliary forms of TB
should be considered in recipients of HSCT presenting
with an unexplained pyrexia and diffuse reticulonodular
shadows [6,13]. The following factors are associated with
high mortality rates in patients with miliary TB: delayed
diagnosis, late administration of treatment and the pres-
ence of complications such as disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC), septic shock, adult respiratory distress
syndrome and multiorgan failure [19]. All our HSCT
patients who developed TI had: AML, several courses of
intravenous cytotoxic chemotherapy with idarubicin and
cytosine arabinoside and allogeneic grafts. They all had
total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide condition-
ing and acute GVHD treated with steroids. In 1 of these
patients, TB presented acutely and was miliary in distribu-
tion causing a multisystem failure.
In patients with pulmonary TB: anemia, leucocytosis,
thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia and a high erythro-
cyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can occur [24]. Miliary TB
can present with pancytopenia, bone marrow necrosis
and granuloma formation [25,26]. TB may present with
DIC and should be considered in the differential diagno-
sis of thrombocytopenia particularly in patients having
abnormal chest radiographs [13,19,27]. In immunocom-
promised patients, TB may coexist with fungal infections
and may be localized or disseminated [19,28]. Even in
apparently healthy individuals living in endemic areas, TB
is the commonest infectious cause of pyrexia of unknown
origin [29]. TB was the cause of thrombocytopenia in 1 of
our patients. Also, TB involved the psoas muscle and it co-
existed with a disseminated aspergillus infection in
another patient.
INH prophylaxis should be considered in HSCT recipients
with: healed TB receiving corticosteroid therapy, known
family contacts, previous bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
immunotherapy or history of an inadequately treated TB
[8,12]. INH is effective in the prevention of active TB in
patients with malignant hematological disorders and is
well tolerated [30]. Anti-TB drugs are associated with sev-
eral adverse effects that include: fever, leucopenia, agran-
ulocytosis, allergic reactions and an elevation of liver
enzymes [31,32]. Fortunately, most of these toxic reac-
tions are reversible [31]. In countries where drug resist-
ance is high, three or four anti-TB drugs should be
employed [16]. Recurrence of TB, increasing multiple
resistance to the current drugs and non-compliance with
treatment are challenging problems [18]. INH prophy-
laxis was used successfully in 5 of our patients. No major
toxicity related to anti-TB therapy was encountered in our
group of patients. Two of our patients were non-compli-
ant with treatment and 1 patient had a multi-drug resist-
ant strain.
We acknowledge that the number of the patients studied
was rather small and that retrospective analyses have their
own limitations. Therefore, further multicentric prospec-
tive studies are required to explore the various aspects of

TIs in immunocompromized individuals living in areas
that are endemic for TB.
In conclusion: TB is a serious infection in immunocom-
promised individuals. Sometimes, empirical anti-TB ther-
apy is necessary when the clinical and the radiological
features are strongly suggestive of TI particularly in
patients living in endemic areas. In our patients, TIs
occurred predominantly in males and in patients with
chronic myeloproliferative disorders, myelodysplasia and
AML. The more intensive the cytotoxic chemotherapy
(repeated courses of intravenous chemotherapy rather
than oral chemotherapeutic agents) given for the treat-
ment of the primary hematological disorder, the earlier
the development of TI and the more likely that the infec-
tion would be disseminated. In HSCT patients, TIs
occurred in patients with AML, those treated with
repeated courses of intravenous cytotoxic chemotherapy,
those who received allogeneic grafts and conditioned with
total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide and in
patients having GVHD treated with corticosteroids. The
absence of TIs in patients with ALL and CLL and the pre-
dominant lung involvement were striking features in our
group of patients.
