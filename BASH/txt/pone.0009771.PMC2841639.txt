Abstract
T-cell receptor gene rearrangements were studied in Aotus monkeys developing high antibody titers and sterilizing
immunity against the Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite upon vaccination with the modified synthetic peptide 24112,
which was identified in the Merozoite Surface Protein 2 (MSP-2) and is known to bind to HLA-DRb1*0403 molecules with
high capacity. Spectratyping analysis showed a preferential usage of Vb12 and Vb6 TCR gene families in 67% of HLA-
DRb1*0403-like genotyped monkeys. Docking of peptide 24112 into the HLA-DRb1*0401–HA peptide–HA1.7TCR complex
containing the VDJ rearrangements identified in fully protected monkeys showed a different structural signature compared
to nonprotected monkeys. These striking results show the exquisite specificity of the TCR/pMHCII complex formation
needed for inducing sterilizing immunity and provide important hints for a logical and rational methodology to develop
multiepitopic, minimal subunit-based synthetic vaccines against infectious diseases, among them malaria.

Introduction
The appropriate fit of antigenic and immunogenic peptides
inside the groove or peptide binding region (PBR) of class II major
histocompatibility complex molecules (MHCII) is a crucial event
for the formation of an appropriate T-cell receptor–(TCR)-
peptide–MHCII complex (TCR/pMHCII) and the subsequent
activation of an antibody-mediated immune response [1]. Fine
antigen recognition and binding specificity is conferred by the
interaction of hypervariable amino acid sequences of a and b
TCR chains, named Complementarity Determining Regions 1, 2
and 3 (CDRs), with structural features of the pMHCII complex,
being most diversity concentrated in the b-chain CDR3 [2,3,4,5].
Malaria disease, in particular the one caused by the Plasmo-
dium falciparum parasite, remains a serious public health
problem worldwide, causing more than 500 million cases and
killing 3 million of them per year [6]. To develop a fully effective
antimalarial vaccine, so desperately needed, it is therefore essential
to understand, at the deepest level, the formation of the TCR/
pMHCII complex capable of conferring sterilizing immunity
against this deadly disease.
To develop a logical and rational methodology for designing
minimal subunit-based, multiepitopic, multistage, chemically
synthesized vaccines, capable of inducing sterilizing immunity
against this threatening scourge and some others, we have iden-
tified functionally-relevant, short (15–20-mer-long synthetic pep-
tides or minimal subunits), conserved High Activity Binding
Peptides (HABPs) derived from P. falciparum proteins involved
in invasion to host cells as promising malaria vaccine targets [7].
However, conserved HABPs were found to be neither antigenic
nor immunogenic or protection inducers when tested in Aotus
monkeys, a non-human primate model highly susceptible to
human malarias [8,9] and whose immune system molecules share
a high degree of similarity with their human counterparts, specially
with those involved in antigen presentation such as a/b TCRs
[10,11] and MHCII–HLA-DRb1*-like molecules (88% to 100%
similarity is reported for the Peptide binding region or PBR of
these molecules) [12].
To solve this absence of antigenicity and immunogenicity,
hundreds of trials were carried out with native and modified
HABPs in large numbers of Aotus monkeys, finding that conserved
HABPs could be rendered immunogenic and sterilizing
immunity inducers by replacing their critical host cell binding
residues by others having similar mass but opposite polarity.
Specific replacement rules were defined [13] such that F must
replace R and viceversa (F«R); W«Y; L«H; I«N; P«D;
M«K; A«S; C«T or V; Q«E; and G has special
physicochemical properties [13,14].
Bearing in mind these principles, we studied the Merozoite
Surface Protein 2 (MSP-2), a 48–69 kDa glycosylphosphatidyli-

nositol (GPI)-anchored merozoite surface molecule considered as
promising antimalarial vaccine candidate due to its surface
localization and immunological properties [15]. The screening of
20-mer-long peptides spanning the entire sequence of MSP-2 and
overlapping with their neighbors by 5 residues led to the
identification of the conserved N-terminal HABP 4044 (21
KNES-
KYSNTFINNAYNMSIR40
), binding with high affinity to red
blood cells (RBCs) [16] but same as reported for other conserved
HABPs, 4044 was neither immunogenic nor induced protection
against experimental challenge with the highly virulent Aotus-
adapted P. falciparum FVO strain when its polymerized form was
used as immunogen. Therefore, HABP 4044 peptide analogues
modified in critical RBC binding residues identified by glycine
analogue screening (highlighted in bold types throughout the
manuscript), were synthesized according to the rules mentioned
above [17]. Immunization and challenge trials in monkeys lead to
the identification of peptide 24112 (24
SKYSNTFNINAYNM-
VIRRSM43
; modified residues are shown underlined) as the most
promising subunit vaccine component since it induced high
antibody titers that recognized a P. falciparum merozoite surface
protein by IFA and a ,60 kDa molecule in P. falciparum schizont
lysate, as assessed by Western blot analysis [17], and induced
sterilizing immunity in 2 out of the 10 monkeys being
immunized in a first trial and 1 of the 8 monkeys immunized in a
second trial [18]. This protection was associated with high specific
binding activity to purified HLA-DRb1*0401 molecules in vitro
[18].
Being aware of the genetic control of the immune response,
specially by MHCII molecules, and the exquisite specificity of the
TCR-pMHCII complex formation in the induction of the
appropriate immune response, modified HABP 24112 was
inoculated in this study into in a new group of MHCII genotyped
Aotus monkeys to analyze, at the structural level, the precise
molecular mechanism of TCR/pMHCII complex formation
resulting in induction of sterilizing immunity. For this
purpose, spectratyping assays [19] were carried out to analyze
the preferential usage of TCR b-chain variable region (Vb) CDR3
families in those Aotus monkeys developing high antibody titers and
sterilizing immunity against the P. falciparum parasite upon
vaccination with the modified synthetic peptide 24112, as well as
in those that, despite developing lower antibody titers or not
producing antibodies, were not protected.
The TCR–24112–MHCII complex associated with inducing
sterilizing immunity against P. falciparum was studied by
performing docking and energy minimization studies of this
modified HABP with the previously reported X-ray crystallo-
graphic structure of the Hemagglutinin (HA) peptide, co-
crystallized inside the HLA-DRb1*0401–HA peptide–TCR com-
plex [20,21]. Care was taken to modify this reported structure
according to the HLA-DRb1*04 and TCR Vb CDR3 amino acid
sequence variations identified in protected and non-protected Aotus
monkeys to determine spontaneous H bond formation, van der
Waals (vdW) interactions, residue orientation and intermolecular
distance differences between interacting atoms, to analyze this
difference at the 3D structural level.
The results demonstrate, at the atomic level, that this first
sterilizing-immunity inducing antimalarial peptide fits inside
the specifically modified HLA-DRb1*0403-24112–HA1.7 TCR
complex, displaying a completely different pattern from that of
monkeys carrying a different HLA-DRb1*-like genotype that were
not protected, thereby demonstrating that immunogenicity and
induction of sterilizing immunity against transmissible diseas-
es, like malaria, requires for specifically modified HABPs to fit
appropriately inside the PBR of MHCII molecules so as to be
specifically recognized by the TCR. Furthermore, the data here
provided can be extrapolated to other molecules and pathogens as
part of a logical and rational vaccine development methodology
against transmissible diseases, malaria one of them.
Results
The 24112 modified peptide is highly immunogenic and
induces sterilizing immunity in Aotus monkeys: the HLA-
DRb1*0403-like allelic variant
Based on the similarity of the MHC-DRB exon 2 of Aotus
monkeys genotyped with HLA-DRb1*alleles as described by
Suarez et al. according to their peptide binding pockets [12],
eighteen (18) Aotus were selected from a group of 40 nonfamily,
non geographically-related genotyped Aotus monkeys and classified
into 4 immunization groups as follows: Group A (HLA-
DRb1*0403-like) contained 6 MHC-AoDRb*W45/47 monkeys
which shared 92%–100% similarity with HLA-DRb1*0403;
Group B (HLA-DRb1*0422-like) included 5 MHC-AoDRb*06
typed monkeys showing 95% similarity to HLA-DRb1*0422;
Group C consisted of 2 MHC-AoDRb1*03 (HLA-DRb1*0701-
like) monkeys sharing 89%–95% similarity with HLA-DRb1*0301
and one MHC-AoDRb*W38 (HLA-DRb1*0701-like) monkey
showing 87%–93% similarity to HLA-DRb1*0701. An immuni-
zation control denoted as Group D contained 4 monkeys with
diverse MHC-AoDRb alleles due to the limited number of
monkeys typing HLA-DRb1*04-like [12] (Figure 1).
Monkeys in Groups A, B and C developed two strikingly
different immune responses after being vaccinated with peptide
24112 emulsified in Freund’s adjuvant (Figure 1). Indirect
immunofluorescence assays (IFA) detected very high antibody
titers ($1:1,280) in four out of the six (,67%) HLA-DRb1*0403-
like genotyped monkeys in Group A (Ao191, Ao250, Ao149 and
Ao259) after the second and third immunizations, as indicated by
the recognition of a merozoite membrane immunofluorescence
pattern in late schizonts, which is in complete agreement with the
surface localization of MSP-2 (Figure 2A). Furthermore, Western
blot analyses of P. falciparum-schizont lysates using the same
hyperimmune sera showed strong reactivity with protein bands of
63, 54, 51 and 48 kDa, which are close to the molecular weight of
MSP-2 (,69kDa) and its cleavage fragments. The remaining two
HLA-DRb1*0403-like monkeys in Group A (Ao239 and Ao277)
developed lower antibody titers (1:320) and showed a weaker
Western blot recognition of MSP-2 and its cleavage fragments at
the same serum dilution (1:200) (Figure 2B).
While nonprotected control monkey developed very high
parasitemias patent by day 5, reaching $5% by days 8–11 and
requiring immediate treatment, the same four HLA-DRb1*0403-
like monkeys that developed high antibody titers ($1:1,280) were
fully protected against experimental challenge. Protection being
understood as the complete absence of blood parasites in the
whole slide (screening under the fluorescence microscopy and with
Acridine Orange staining of ,1,000,000 RBCs per monkey per
day) during the 15 days that the experiment lasted (Figure 1 and
2C). This indicated that 24112 confers sterilizing immunity to
two thirds (66.6%) of the HLA-DRb1*0403-like genotyped Aotus
monkeys (Ao191, Ao250, Ao149 and Ao259). On the contrary, the
other two monkeys (Ao239 and Ao277) producing lower antibody
titers (1:320) developed high parasitemia levels on day 4–5 post-
challenge that were comparable to the levels shown by monkeys in
the control group (Figure 2C).
Only three out of the five HLA-DRb1*0422-like monkeys in
Group B (Ao142, Ao224 and Ao159) developed low antibody
titers (1:160) after the third immunization, whereas no antibodies

were detected in the other two Group B monkeys (Ao148 and
Ao208). No anti-P. falciparum antibodies were detected in sera from
Group C or Group D monkeys, as determined by IFA titers
(Figure 1) and Western blot assays nor were any of the monkeys
in Groups B, C or D protected against experimental challenge
with P. falciparum (Figure 2C).
Docking of peptide 24112 into the MHCII of protected
and non-protected monkeys
Based on the strong association between the HLA-DRb1*0403
genetic characteristic with 24112’s sterile immunity induction
ability, the 3D structure of this modified HABP determined by us
[17] and the 3D structure of the HLA-DRb1*0401 molecule
determined by Hennecke [20,21], docking studies of 24112 were
performed on this MHCII molecule.
In our previous 1
H NMR studies, peptide 24112 displayed a
distorted type III9 b-turn spanning from residue Y3 to T6 and a
classical type III9 b-turn structure between residues A11 and M14
[17], whereas the rest of the molecule was unstructured. Similar to
the HA peptide’s crystallographic structure complexed with the
HLA-DRb1*0401 molecule [20], 24112 peptide’s residues fitting
into Pocket 1 (Y12 fuchsia) and Pocket 9 (M20 green) were
downwardly-orientated and deeply embedded into these pockets
(Figure 3A), whereas residues fitting into Pocket 4 (V15 dark blue)
and Pocket 6 (R17 brown) were more shallowly embedded than
the above-mentioned residues [22,23,24].
Several other probable binding registers of 24112 were docked
on HLA-DRb1*0401 but none of them completely displayed the
characteristic binding motives of this alleles [25] and none allowed
a perfect fit inside the PBR of this MHCII molecule, therefore
suggesting that the only probable structure was YNMVIRRSM
(underlined residues fit into pockets 1, 4, 6 and 9, respectively).
Docking of 24112 into the HLA-DRb1*0403 structure
modified according to the MHCII sequence of protected Ao191
showed that the structure was stabilized by the spontaneous
formation of SEVEN of the ten canonical H bonds [22,23,24]
(Figure 3B,C). These 7 H bonds formed between 24112
peptide’s backbone atoms (written in one-letter code hereafter)
and MHC lateral chain residues (written in 3-letter code
throughout this manuscript) and their interatomic distances
(shown in Amstrongs inside parenthesis, throughout this manu-
script and indicted by an asterisk in Figure 3C,F) were
established as follows: Y12 interacting with Pocket 1 Sera53 (in
fuschia, 1.81 A˚ ), N13 with P2 Asnb82 (in red, 2.13 A˚ ), N13 with
P2 Asnb82 (in red, 1.93 A˚ ), R17 with Pocket 6 Asna62 (in brown,
2.46 A˚ ); R18 with Pocket 7 Asna69 (in dark gray, 2.0 A˚ ), R18 with
Pocket 7 Tyrb30 (in dark gray, 2.42 A˚ ) and M20 with Pocket 9
Asna69 (in green, 1.93 A˚ ).
By the same token, docking of 24112 into the modified HLA-
DRb1*0422 structure of Ao148 (non-protected, non-antibody
producer monkey) showed the spontaneous formation of SIX of
the 10 canonical H bonds between atoms of the peptide’s
backbone and MHCII lateral chain residues (Figure 3E,F).
Binding of Y12, N13 and M20 involved the same residues
mediating binding of 24112 to HLA-DRb1*0403 in Ao191, but
displayed a totally different H-bonding pattern in the 24112–
HLA-DRb1*0422 complex between V15 with Pocket 4 Glna9 (in
dark blue, 2.27 A˚ ), and R17 with Pocket 6 Lysb71 (in brown,
1.71 A˚ ). It can be clearly seen that no H bonds are established
between 24112’s R18 backbone and lateral chains of HLA-
DRb1*0422 At this point, it is worth to remember that H bonds
are not determined by their interactions distances but also by their
torsion angles.
Additional differences were observed between these two
pMHCII complexes (highlighted in pale gray in Figure 3C,F).
In the HLA-DRb1*0403 molecule, vdW interactions were
preferentially established between lateral chain atoms of N13
with Thrb77, R17 with Glua21, Glua11 and Aspa66 (the latter
two confer a negatively charge character to pocket 6 that strongly
stabilizes binding of positively charged residues like R, K or H
[23]), a polarity further accentuated by the Aspb70Gln difference
in this allelic variant. H bonds are also established between lateral
chain atoms of R18 with Aspb66 and Aspb70.

genotyped monkeys analyzed in this study. On top in the first row, the amino acid sequence of the reference HLA-DRb1*0401 molecule as reported
by Hennecke [20]. Monkeys were classified into different immunization groups (A, B, C and D) according to the similarity of their MHC class II DRb
exon 2 nucleotide sequences to HLA-DRb1* alleles, displayed on top of each group as reference. Each monkey’s antibody titers (Ab Titers)
(determined by IFA) before (P0) or 20 days after each immunization (II20, III20), as well as protection results (Prot) against experimental challenge and
expanded TCR bV families are shown. Residues conforming the HLA-DRb1*04 pockets are highlighted in different colors according to the following
code: pocket 1 (P1), pale fuchsia; pocket 4 (P4), blue; pocket 6 (P6), orange; pocket 7 (P7), gray and pocket 9 (P9), light green.

Meanwhile in HLA-DRb1*0422 peptide 24112, vdW interac-
tions (Figure 3F, pale gray) are specifically established between
lateral chain atoms of N13 with Asnb77, R17 with Glua11, R18
with Trpb61 and Tyrb67, and S19 with Tyrb67; displaying a
strikingly different H bonding and vdW interaction pattern in
Pocket 6, that results in a different orientation of R18 (Figure 3D).
These H-bonding differences approximate R18 to Trpb61 in the
HLA-DRb1*0403-like–24112 complex preventing an appropriate
H bonding between backbone atoms of 24112 with Asna69 and
Tyrb30 (Figure 3A) residues of the HLA-DRb1*0422 molecule,
as situation clearly visible in Figure 3D, were these two H bonds
that are critical for the anchoring and stabilization of the peptide
inside the PBR are not observed in Figure 3E nor measured in
Figure 3F. It is well know that H bonds give high stability and
specificity to the pMHCII complex formation due to the exquisite
energetic dependence on the stereochemistry and geometry of the
bond.
Preferential usage of Vb families in immunized monkeys
The spectratyping analysis of the TCR repertoire provides a
global picture based on a reduced number of cells, and helps
determining the complexity and stability of a T cell repertoire in
response to an antigenic stimulus, but it only provides a qualitative
description of the T-cell mediated immune response raised against
a particular antigen. Nevertheless, the methodology here reported
is useful, specific and sensitive enough for detecting the different
TCR CDR3b sequences that expand in response to a specific
antigen.
Based on the Aotus Vb sequences reported to date [10,11], the
spectratyping analysis of the CDR3 amplicons showed a
polyclonal Gaussian-like distribution for the majority of TCR
Vb families in the pre-immune (P0) samples (Figure S1a)
typical of unstimulated T cells. The CDR3 size distribution
pattern (Figure S1b) changed strikingly to skewed oligoclonal
expansions of one, two or three dominant Vb families in Ao191,
Ao259, Ao149, Ao250, Ao239, Ao277, Ao142, Ao224 and Ao148
upon immunization with peptide 24112; however, such skewed
patterns were only associated with high antibody production in
Ao191, Ao259, Ao149, Ao250, Ao239 and Ao277. CDR3 Vb
distribution of control monkeys receiving only Freund’s adjuvant
(Group D) showed Gaussian-like patterns similar to the ones found
in P0 samples.
Post-immunization lymphocyte samples of the fully-protected
HLA-DRb1*0403-like genotyped monkeys (Group A) developing
high antibody titers after the second (II20) and third (III20) doses
showed a selectively higher usage of the TCR families Vb12
(Ao191, Ao149 and Ao250) and Vb6 (Ao259) in T-cell clones
expanding in response to immunization with 24112 (Table S1).
Striking differences were found in the TCR family usage of the
non-protected monkeys Ao239 and Ao277 developing lower
antibody titers against P. falciparum, which preferentially expressed
Vb5 and Vb19 TCR families (Table 1).
HLA-DRb1*0422-like non-protected monkeys (Group B)
developing low or no detectable antibody titers (Figure 1) showed

level between protected and nonprotected monkeys in the TCR

epitope. Therefore these later antibodies must have different

affinities and/or structural characteristics, a subject currently
under study at our institute.
Sequencing of TCR-Vb CDR3 segments
The Vb CDR3 sequences of expanded T-cell clones indicated a
random usage of J segments in each of the expanded Vb families.
For example, Vb12 CDR3 expanded sequences of the antibody-
producer protected Ao191 and Ao149 monkeys included almost
all possible J segments (J1.1, J1.2, J1.4, J2.1, J2.2 and J2.3; Table
S1). This shows that different T lymphocyte subpopulations with
similar CDR3b lengths are involved in the sterilizing immune
response induced by peptide 24112 and suggests a clear
polyclonal response to a molecularly defined antigen in individuals
with specific and determined genetic backgrounds, clearly visible
in the reactivity of these sera in Western blot analyses (Figure 2B).
The amino acid sequence variations found in the Vb12 D
region of the fully protected Ao191 (Table 1; clone 3) as well as
the differences detected in the Vb15 D region of the non-
protected, non-antibody producer Ao148 (Table 1; clone 5) were
used to modify the Vb3S1 sequence (belonging to the same Vb12
family) of the HLA-DRb1*0401–HA–HA1.7 TCR crystal struc-
ture [20,21], as described in detail below.
Structural analysis of the MHCII–24112–TCR complex
The previously reported HLA-DRb1*0401–HA–HA1.7 TCR
crystal structure [20,21] was modified to determine the HLA-
DRb1*0403-like–24112–TCR structure of the fully protected
Ao191 and the HLA-DRb1*0422-like–24112–TCR structure of
the non-protected Ao148. These molecules were analyzed and
compared, at the structural level, to examine H bond formation and
distance differences. For the HLA-DRb1*0403-like–24112–TCR
complex, the TCR Vb3S1 sequence was modified in the CDR3b
region according to the variations found in the Vb12 D region of
clone 3 from protected Ao191 as follows (TCR residues are written
in three-letter code throughout this manuscript): Phe3b96Ser,
Leu3b97Thr, Glu3b98Gly, Gly3b99Leu, Gly3b100Pro and As-

numbered according to Hennecke’s system [21]. For the HLA-
DRb1*0422-like–24112–TCR complex, the TCR Vb3S1 was
replaced by the Vb15 family sequence found in clone 5 from the
non-protected, non-antibody producer Ao148 as follows:
Arg3b96Ser, Asp3b97Thr; Glu3b98Gly; Glu3b99Leu; As-
p3b100Pro and Asp3b105Gly in the J region.
When the complete HLA-DR1*0403–24112–TCRVb12 mod-
ified complex was superimposed onto the original 3D structure of
the HLA-DRb1*0401–HA–HA1.7 TCR complex [20,21], it
displayed a 1.41 r.m.s.d. Similarly, the HLA-DRb1*0422–
24112–TCRVb15 modified complex displayed a 1.32 r.m.s.d.
when it was superimposed with HLA-DRb1*0401–HA–
HA1.7TCR complex.
Based on the above mentioned information and the fact that
TCR Va displays limited polymorphism (therefore their CDRs
were not cloned in this study), the 3D structure of the HLA-
DRb1*0401–HA–HA1.7 TCR complex, used as template,
showed in docking analyses that binding of such modified
HA1.7 TCR to both HLA-DRb1*04–24112 complexes is
mediated by the interaction of the TCR Va region with the
peptide’s N-terminal portion, while the C-terminal fragment

24112 atoms recognized by modified TCR CDRs
While 24112 is deeply buried inside the HLA-DRb1*0403
molecule (Figure 3A), N13 (corresponding to P2 in red), M14
(P3 in pale blue), I16 (P5 in pink), R18 (P7 in gray), and S19
(P8 in yellow) are upwardly-oriented, particularly R18 (gray),
and therefore available to TCR inspection (Figure 4A,B). The
CDR3b Vb12 of protected Ao191 shows spontaneous forma-
tion of THREE H bonds (shown as small dots in Figure 4A,B;
highlighted in dark gray in Figure 4C where they are
indicated by asterisks): one between N13 with Proa29 from
CDR1a (white ribbon on top), two between R18 with Leub97
(2.44 A˚ ) and R18 with Glyb99 (2.43 A˚ ) from CDR3b (red
ribbon on top). TWO more vdW interactions are observed
between M14 with Glub94 (4.02 A˚ ) from CDR3a (yellow
ribbon), and M14 with Sera95 from CDR3a (yellow ribbon on
top) (3.49 A˚ ).
In the analysis of the TCR contacting residues of HLA-
DRb1*0422–24112 complexed with the CDR3b Vb15 region of
the non-protected Ao148 (Figure 4 D,E,F) only ONE H bond
(Figure 4F, dark gray indicated by an asterisk) is spontaneously
formed between S19 and Glub99 (1.52 A˚ ), while TWO vdW
interactions are observed between N13 with Aspa28 (3.91 A˚ ) from
CDR1a (in white ribbon), and R18 with Glub98 (3.61 A˚ ) from
CDR3b (in red ribbon), perhaps due to the horizontal localization
of this peptide’s residue R18 (Figure 4E). This complex displays
therefore fewer and weaker electrostatic interactions with the
TCR.

induced a twist and slight displacement towards HLA-
DRb1*0422 a-chain residues not quantitatively determined in
this study, but clearly seen in Figure 5D and E. The last three
contacts have not been described among the canonical evolu-
tionarily conserved amino acids that control TCR–MHC
interactions, suggesting a different TCR contacting mode in this
non-protective complex [27,28,29,30,31].
The distances and electrostatic properties also show that only
five (5) salt bridges (Figure 5C,F; dark gray) are established
between the residues conforming the non-protective HLA-
DRb1*0422–Vb15 TCR complex, whereas in the protection-
associated HLA-DRb1*0403–Vb12 TCR complex, eight (8) salt
bridges, are determined suggesting a stronger and more stable
interaction of this pMHCII complex; a condition needed to
stabilize the complex and properly activate the immune system
toward a sterilizing immunity response.
It has been clearly shown that the strongest interactions are
established between lateral chain atoms of MHCII molecules and
atoms from the peptide’s backbone (Figure 3), whereas in the
peptide/TCR interaction the strongest bonds are established
with the peptide’s lateral chain atoms (Figure 4), among which
salt bridges are the most important electrostatic forces.
In essence, this study clearly shows that important differences
exist between residues’ orientation and electrostatic forces
established in these TCR/pMHCII complexes, which are
associated with two different immunological outcomes induced
by the same peptide in slightly different variants of the same HLA-
DRb1*04 allele.
Discussion
The structural data obtained in this study at the 3-dimensional
level provides strong evidence that the TCR/pMHCII complex
formed with the specifically modified HABP 24112 derived from
the P. falciparum MSP-2 protein, inductor of high anti-parasite
antibody titers and sterile immunity in 67% of HLA-
DRb1*0403-like genotyped Aotus monkeys (Figure 1), has a
strikingly different 3D structure conformation from the one
observed in non-protected non-antibody producer HLA-
DRb1*0422-like genotyped monkeys immunized with the same
peptide (Figures 3–5). This is clearly demonstrated by a large set
of differences in the salt bridges, H bonds and vdW interactions,
interatomic distances and contacting residues’ orientation between
both complexes.
In this study, we show that Aotus monkeys developing high
antibody titers and being protected against experimental challenge
with the lethal P. falciparum malaria FVO strain carry the HLA-
DRb1*0403-like genetic marker and have a preferential usage of
Vb12 and Vb6 TCR families (Table 1), whereas the same
molecule was poorly or not immunogenic nor protection-inducing
in Aotus monkeys carrying a slightly different HLA-DRb1*04
allelic variant like HLA-DRb1*0422 and that such weaker and/or
nonprotective immune response was associated with the preferen-
tial usage of TCR Vb 9, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 28 families; therefore
confirming the exquisite specificity of the TCR/pMHCII
formation in sterilizing immunity induction against malaria.
While Group C monkeys immunized with 24112 and carrying
some other non HLA-DRb1*04-like alleles did not develop any
detectable antibody titers nor were protected against experimental
challenge, same as monkeys in control Group D (inoculated with
Freund’s adjuvant only), these data show that peptide 24112 is
neither recognized nor presented by these MHCII alleles, a fact
corroborated by the inability of 24112 to bind experimentally to
other purified HLA-DRb1*
molecules (Group C) [17,18].
Therefore the immune response observed in Group A HLA-
DRb1*0403 monkeys is HLA-DRb1*0403-specific and not the
result of an unspecific stimulation induced by the Freund’s
adjuvant, as show by Group D results (here only one HLA-
DRb1*0422 monkey was included due to the low frequency of this
allelic variant).
Docking studies clearly demonstrate that the TCR/pMHCII
complex has to be properly assembled in order to induce
sterilizing immunity against this deadly disease, expanding
and confirming the elegant structural studies on antigenicity
with the Influenza virus Hemagglutinin A (HA) peptide [22],
immunogenicity with several immunodominant epitopes from
hen egg lisozyme (HEL) [32] and Conalbumin (CA) [33],
autoimmunity induced by the Col II peptide in rheumatoid
arthritis [24] and many more. However it should be highlighted
that the present study is hitherto the first immunogenicity and
sterilizing immunity study on against any microbe thoroughly
analyzed up to the structural level.
Bearing in mind that the 24112 modified peptide induced high
immunogenicity and sterilizing immunity in 67% of HLA-
DRb1*0403-like genotyped monkeys, these data clearly suggest
that additional modified HABPs should be included in a vaccine
formulation in order to activate more TCR/pMHCII complexes
and to develop complete protection against malaria in HLA-
DRb1*0403 individuals. Furthermore, a substantially larger
number of modified HABPs has to be included in a fully effective,
multiepitopic, multistage, minimal subunit-based, chemically
synthesized antimalarial vaccine capable of conferring protection
to ALL different HLA-DRb1* alleles, and variants, even more
considering that the parasite employs multiple molecules and
invasion mechanisms [34], the majority of which display a large
number of exquisite genetic variations to evade the host’s immune
system pressure that are able to distract the complete immune
system b y displaying just one amino acid variation [35].
Therefore all parasite pathways and strategies for invading
RBCs and liver cells (or at least the most relevant ones), must be
destroyed or at least blocked to prevent parasite’s entry into
target cells. This notion is further supported by the recent
transcriptome analyses demonstrating that ,58–90 of all P.
falciparum proteins are involved directly in RBC invasion [36] and
probably a similar number are involved in sporozoite invasion to
the liver cells [37].
In our docked structures of the protection-associated HLA-
DRb1*0403-24112–TCR complex, the most variable regions of
the TCR (CDR3a (yellow) and CDR3 b (red)) are located in the
central portion of the binding interface with 24112, while the
most conserved CDR1 and CDR2 regions make contact with the
upper surface of the MHCII helices that are surrounding CDR3
like a gasket [30,31]. Although residues M14 in P3 (pale blue) and
I16 in P5 (pink) are not establishing H bonds or vdW interactions
with the TCR, they fit perfectly well inside the hydrophobic
grooves.
Meanwhile, the CDR3a does not make contact with any 24112
contacting residues (e.g. P3 (M14), P5 (I16), P7 (R18)) in the
24112–HLA-DRb1*0422 complex, and fewer H bonds and vdW
forces are established in this complex, which suggests little
probability of TCR inspection and weaker interaction of this
pMHCII complex with the TCR in this non-protective complex.
TCR/pMHCII in Malaria Immunity
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 March 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 3 | e9771
The striking variations found between the Vb15 clone-5 TCR–
24112–HLA-DRb1*0422 and the Vb12-clone-3 TCR–24112–
HLA-DRb1*0403 complexes in the CDRs usage of evolution-
ary conserved residue contacts [27,28,29,30,31], specifically
regarding salt bridge formation (5 in the former complex and 8 in
the later complex) as well as in the orientation of contacting
residues in the TCR-MHCII footprint, suggests a different
recognition pattern and a different docking footprint on the
TCR/pMHCII interaction between these 2 complexes associated
with two different immune responses: non-antibody production
and non-protection versus antibody production and protection
induction, respectively.
The conservation of the critical residues controlling the ‘‘TCR/
pMHCII interaction’’ suggests that the vast peptide’s recognition
specificity displayed in sterilizing immunity against modified
peptides is almost entirely driven by the appropriate configuration
of the HLA-DRb1*0403–24112 peptide complex, which displays
a completely different array of H bonds and vdW networks
compared to the non-immunogenic, non-protective HLA-
DRb1*0422–24112 peptide complex structure [27,28,29,30,31].
Studies by Kersh et al. [38] on the binding of Hemoglobin (Hb
64–76) peptide to I-EK
molecules have elegantly shown that subtle
modifications such as replacing the D residue in the E73D
sequence of the Hb peptide fitting inside Pocket 6 modifies the
orientations and interatomic distances of P5, P7 and P8 with their
TCR contacts, which is in turn reflected in a 1,000-fold reduction
in the potency of the altered peptide 24112 to induce antibody
production. Our situation is different since the same peptide is
anchored to both TCR/pMHCII complexes but the slight
differences within the genetic background of the Aotus HLA-
DRb1*04-like molecules lead to different H bonding and vdW
patterns, specially between the peptide’s backbone atoms and
lateral chains residues of the pMHCII molecule. Furthermore,
conserved residues controlling the ‘‘TCR/pMHCII interaction’’
display a different hydrogen bonding and salt bridge formation
pattern.
Since in previous studies in which we had characterized the
Aotus MHC-DRb exon 2 [12,39] in a large number of monkeys
show that the amino acids that define the PBR pockets share a
mean similarity of 89–94% with HLA-DRb1*0403 (with a
minimum similarity of 82–88% and a maximum of 94–100%), a
mean similarity of 91% with HLA-DRb1*0422 (a minimum
similarity of 88% and maximum of 94%), and quite similar
similarity values with the other alleles analyzed in this study.
Furthermore since most substitutions are functionally and
evolutionary conserved [40,41], we can conclude that the results
observed in the Aotus monkey model mimic in a very high degree
the TCR-pMHCII complex formation in humans, thus highlight-
ing the extreme importance of this nonhuman primate for human
vaccine development.
Given that Glna9, Asna62, Asna69, Trpb61 and Asnb82
residues establishing H bonds with the peptide’s backbone are
conserved among humans and Aotus (unpublished results), these
data suggest that the modified HABP 24112 properly fitting into
HLA-DRb1*0403 molecules could be used almost immedi-
ately for human vaccination in individuals carrying this allelic
variant and highlights this peptide as the first component of a
sterilizing-immunity-inducing, multiepitopic, multistage,
minimal subunit-based, chemically synthesized antimalarial
vaccine for human use.
Furthermore, the data clearly show that developing fully
effective vaccines is a far more elaborated and complex process
than merely vaccinating humans with recombinant fragments
(either individually or as mixtures), viral vector, DNA-based or
unmodified short or long synthetic peptides [42], which have lead
to «disappointing» and frustrating results [42,43,44], some of them
with deleterious effects. The evidence also indicates that the
molecular characteristics of the microbe and the host play a
fundamental role in the conformation of the appropriate TCR/
pMHCII complex to induce sterilizing immunity.
Finally, it is worth noting that all the evidence shown here was
obtained by using the most stringent system to asses sterilizing
immunity (since a 100% infective dose of an Aotus-adapted P.
falciparum strain was intravenously inoculated into monkeys),
which allow us to conclude that multiantigenic, multistage,
minimal subunit-based, specifically-modified, chemical-
ly-synthesized vaccines against any transmissible disease like
malaria, must be appropriately designed and modified to fit
perfectly well insidethe TCR/pMHCII complex so as to induce
sterilizing immune responses.
Materials and Methods
Peptides
24112 monomer and polymers were synthesized by using t-boc
chemistry [45]. Polymerization was allowed by adding CG
residues to the N and C terminal ends of peptide 24112
(24
SKYSNTFNINAYNMVIRRSM43
), with a carefully standard-
ized oxidation procedure that guarantees the formation of high
molecular weight polymers (8–24kDa) for immunization purposes.
Aotus monkeys
Forty wild-caught Aotus monkeys were kept in stainless-steel
cages at FIDIC’s primate station in Leticia, Amazonas, Colombia,
and maintained in strict accordance with the NIH guidelines for
animal care and the Colombian Ministry of Health (Law 84/
1989), under the weekly supervision of CORPOAMAZONIA
officials and a primatologist. Monkey sera (1:20 dilution) were
screened by IFA to determine previous exposure to Plasmodium
parasites. Monkeys testing positive were returned to the jungle
without further manipulation [8]. Monkeys’ parasitemias were
assessed daily by reading under fluorescence microscope by
screening 1.000.000 Acridine Orange stained RBCs and they
were immediately treated whenever P. falciparum infected RBCs
were $5%, or before if the monkey’s health condition had
deteriorated. Treatment consisted of orally administered pediatric
doses of Chloroquine (10 mg/kg on the first day and 7.5 mg/kg
per day until day five). Once assuring total clearance of parasites
from blood and excellent health condition, monkeys were released
back into their natural habitat close to the site where they had
been captured with the supervision of CORPOAMAZONIA
officials. All procedures were approved and supervised by FIDIC’s
Ethics Committee in Health Research (Resolution No. 008430 of
1993, Colombian Ministry of Health) and by FIDIC’s Primate
Station Ethics Committee.
MHCII-DRB genotyping
Genomic DNA of each monkey was isolated from peripheral
blood lymphocytes to amplify the MHCII-DRb exon 2 segment
using high-fidelity PCR (ACCUZYME DNA Polymerase), as
described elsewhere [12]. Sequences were obtained by cloning
amplicons into the pCRHBlunt vector (InvitrogenTM
) and allele
types were assigned by comparing them to previously reported
Aotus alleles [12].
Immunization and challenge
Based on their similarity to human HLA-DRb1* alleles
determined by genotyping [12], eighteen monkeys were selected

for this study and classified into different immunization groups
(Figure 1). Groups A (6 monkeys), B (5 monkeys) and C (3
monkeys) were immunized on days 0, 20 and 40 with 125 mg of
peptide 24112 emulsified in Freund’s complete adjuvant for the
first dose, and in Freund’s incomplete adjuvant for the second and
third doses. Group D (4 monkeys) received only Freund’s adjuvant
on the same days. One milliliter of peripheral blood was collected
on day 0 (pre-immune or P0) and 20 days after the second and
third immunizations (II20 and III20, respectively) to obtain
lymphocytes and sera for immunological studies. On day 60, all
monkeys were challenged by intravenous inoculation of a 100%
infective dose (100,000 infected erythrocytes) of the P. falciparum
FVO Aotus-adapted strain, freshly obtained from a previously
infected monkey. Blood parasitemia levels were monitored daily
for 15 days by Acridine Orange staining. Sterilizing immunity
was defined as the complete absence of parasites in the blood of
protected monkeys during the 15 days that the experiment lasted,
as assessed by reading the whole slide (,1.000.000 RBCs were
screened). Controls and non-protected monkeys developed patent
parasitemias by day 5 and high parasitemias ($5%) by days 8–11
after the challenge, therefore requiring immediate treatment
(Figure 1C). Monkeys were kept in quarantine and released
back into the jungle in company of CORPOAMAZONIA
officials.
IFA antibody titers
Air-dried slides containing P. falciparum late-schizonts (FCB-2
strain) obtained from a synchronized continuous culture were used
for determining antibody titers, using twofold serial dilutions of
monkey sera (initial dilution: 1:40). Slides were washed 6 times
with PBS, incubated with the appropriate dilution of affinity
purified FITC-labeled goat anti-Aotus F(ab’)2 IgG fragment,
washed and read by fluorescence microscopy.
Western blot analysis
Briefly, whole schizonts’ lysate of the same FCB-2 synchronous
culture was separated in a discontinuous PAGE system, electro-
transfered to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with
appropriate monkeys’ sera dilutions and with goat anti-Aotus IgG
F(ab’)2 fragment conjugated to Alkaline phosphatase, to asses
immunoreactivity.
No attempts were made to determine cellular immune responses
due to the limited amount of drowned blood and the priority given
to the T cell cloning and spectratyping analyses.
Characterization of the TCR repertoire
The cDNA was synthesized with the SuperScriptTM
III kit
(Invitrogen, CA USA) using RNA isolated from peripheral blood
lymphocytes as template. Nineteen specific forward primers and
a common primer annealing in the b-chain constant (Cb) region
were designed to amplify all Aotus Vb families reported to date
[11]. Additionally, a set of reverse and forward primers
amplifying a 419-bp fragment of the Aotus TCR a-chain
constant (Ca) segment was used as amplification control (Table
S2).
The Ca segments were coamplified together with each of the
19 CDR3 Vb segments using 0.25 mM of Ca forward and
reverse primers, and 0.75 mM of Vb and Cb primers.
Amplification products were subjected to 6 run-off reaction
cycles using Ca and Cb reverse primers labeled with 6-
Carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) on the 59 end. Concentrations
were: 0.5 mM of fluorolabeled reverse primers and 1 mL of each
Vb coamplification product.
Spectratypes and CDR3 TCR Vb segments of immunized
Aotus monkeys
The bp-length and signal intensity of fluorolabeled amplicons
were measured in an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer using
Rox 500 molecular weight markers (both from Applied Biosys-
tems, CA, USA). Spectratypes were analyzed using GeneScanH
Analysis Software, assuming that each peak corresponded to a
particular TCR CDR3 rearrangement. Spectratype patterns
(Gaussian or skewed) were visually evaluated and T-cell oligoclo-
nal expansions were calculated in relative fluorescence intensity
units as described elsewhere [46]. Clonally expanded CDR3
segments were amplified by high-fidelity PCR as described above,
sequenced and analyzed using Clustal W software.
Molecular modeling
3D structure models of the Aotus ab TCR–24112–HLA-
DRb1*0403 and Aotus ab TCR–24112–HLA-DRb1*0422 mo-
lecular complexes was generated by using the crystallographic
structure of the human ab TCR HA1.7 HA peptide–HLA-DR4
(DRA*0101 and DRb1*0401) as molecular template (PDB code:
1J8H) [20]. Replacements were made on these molecules based on
the differences found in the PBR of the high-antibody producer,
fully-protected Ao191 monkey on its HLA-DRb1*0403-like b-
chain amino acid sequence (Phe37Tyr, Ser57Asp, Lys60Tyr,
Leu61Trp, Ile67Leu, Asp70Gln, Ser74Glu and Gly86Val) as well
as in the non-antibody producer, non-protected Ao148 monkey
genotyped as HLA-DRb1*0422-like (Tyr26Phe, Leu67Tyr).
Another structure was generated by replacing the Vb12 family
of the HA1.7 TCR CDR3 D region for the 96
Phe-Leu-Glu-Gly-
Gly100
sequence found in the D region amino acid sequence of
Vb12 clone 3 derived from the protected Ao191 monkey; Gly105
of the J region was also replaced by Asp. By the same token, the
HA 1.7 TCR CDR3 96
Arg-Asp-Glu-Glu-Asp100
D region was
replaced by the 96
Ser-Thr-Gly-Leu-Pro100
sequence found in the
Vb15-clone 5 sequence of the non-antibody producer and non-
protected Ao148 monkey.
A conjugate gradient algorithm was applied to minimize
energies and build a more energetically favorable model of the
complex’s position. To obtain the most appropriate model, 6 to 8
simulations with 10,000 iterations were performed for each
structure, with each of the Vb sequences in the complete template
(PDB code: 1J8H). Insight II (2000) Biopolymer module software
(Accelrys Software Inc., USA), run on an Indigo 2 Station (Silicon
Graphics), was used for superimposing the backbones of the
original template and the obtained model without further
refinements. The rootmean-square deviation between two mole-
cule conformations was then determined.

Figure S1 Spectratype analysis of the TCR Vb repertoire. (A)
Representative Gaussian-like profile shown by most TCR Vb
families of Aotus 191 before being immunized with peptide 24112.
Only Vb families 2, 19, 24 and 29 showed a skewed profile in the
pre-immune sera. (B) Comparison between TCR Vb repertoire
before (P0 above) and after (PIII below) immunization with
peptide 24112. The most notably expanded families were: Vb12
(in Ao191); Vb6 (Ao259); Vb12 (Ao149); Vb5 (Ao239); Vb19
(Ao277); Vb9 (Ao142); Vb7 (Ao224) and Vb15 (Ao148), which
displayed a Gaussian-like distribution pattern in P0 samples and a
skewed pattern in PIII samples from the same monkeys. Due to
space limitations, only some examples are shown.
