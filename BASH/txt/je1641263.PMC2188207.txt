T lymphocytes exert both stimulatory and suppressive effects that regulate the
activity of immune cells. Recent evidence suggests that they may also play a role
in regulating growth and differentiation of other types of hematopoietic cells. T
cells have been observed to enhance proliferation and differentiation of pluri-
potent (1,2) as well as committed precursors from several different hematopoietic
cell types through release of soluble factors (3-6). In addition, abnormalities in
the numbers or state of activation of T cells are sometimes associated with
inhibition of bematopoiesis. For example, certain cases of T cell chronic lympho-
cytic leukemia are associated with anemia or neutropenia (7-9), and increased
numbers of activated T lymphocytes are found in the peripheral blood or bone
marrow of patients with hematopoietic disorders such as aplastic anemia (10-
12), Felty's syndrome (13, 14) or isolated neutropenia (15). In vitro colony
formation by myeloid or erytbroid precursor cells from the bone marrow of
these patients is decreased. However, normal colony formation can be restored
if bone marrow preparations are depleted of T cells (1 1, 16, 17). Moreover,
colony formation by bone marrow cells from healthy donors is suppressed by the
addition of patients' T cells, but not by T cells from healthy donors (12, 13, 16,
18, 19). Although the methods used to remove T lymphocytes in some of the
discussed experiments also remove NK cells, which can mediate colony-inhibiting
activity (20-22), a role for T ceils in colony inhibition has been confirmed in
some experiments in which treatment of patients' bone marrow cells with T cell-
specific mAb and complement restored colony-forming ability (23).
The exact mechanism by which T cells suppress colony formation is unknown.
Zoumbos et al. (12) have shown that mitogen-activated T cells from aplastic
anemia patients produce levels of immune interferon (IFN-3") higher than those
produced by T cells from healthy donors, and that the titers of IFN-3, in the
supernatants correlate with their ability to inhibit colony formation. The same
authors (24) also reported the presence of IFN-2~ in the bone marrow and
peripheral blood of patients with aplastic anemia, and proposed that activated T
cells suppress granulocyte precursors, in vivo as well as in vitro, by release of
IFN-3'. Such a hypothesis is further supported by the observation that conditioned

medium (CM) ~ from PHA-stimulated leukocytes from normal individuals con-
tains colony-inhibiting activity (25, 26) that is neutralized by antibodies against
IFN-3` (26). Indeed, recombinant preparations of IFN3` have been shown (27-
30) to inhibit colony formation by granulocyte and monocyte precursor cells
(colony forming units of granulocytes and monocytes; CFU-GM). However, we
have observed (31) that rIFN-3`, at concentrations corresponding to those nor-
really present in PHA-CM, is capable of only low levels of inhibition of CFU-
GM, and that it acts synergistically with recombinant tumor necrosis factor
(rTNF) to inhibit CFU-GM (31), indicating that other inhibitory factors produced
by activated leukocytes may act together with IFN-3`. TNF is a cytotoxin
produced by activated myeloid or monocyte/macrophage cells (32, 33), and has
biological and antigenic similarities with the colony-inhibiting activity that we
reported (31) to be produced by NK cells upon interaction with bone marrow
cells. Like its effect on bone marrow, antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of
TNF on cell lines are also synergistic with IFN-3` (34). Human lymphotoxin (LT)
is a cytotoxin released by activated lymphocytes and present in PHA-CM (35,
36). LT has 28% homology in amino acid sequence to TNF, and the two
cytotoxins share many biological activities (32). Analogous to the synergy of IFN-
3' with TNF or NK colony-inhibiting activity the antiproliferative effect of LT
on tumor cell lines is enhanced by the addition of 1FN-3` (37-40).
In this paper, we discuss the effect of PHA-CM on colony formation, and show
that PHA-activated purified T cells produce both IFN-3` and LT. which, to-
gether, inhibit colony formation by granulocyte and monocyte precursor cells.
Materials and Methods
Cell Lines. Murine L-929 cells (alpha subline), the human B lymphoblastoid cell line
RPMI-8866 and the antibody-producing hybrid cell clones were maintained in RPMI-
1640 culture medium (Flow Laboratories, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% FCS
(Flow Laboratories).
Monoclonal Antibodies. Antibody OKT3, which reacts with all mature peripheral T
cells (41), was used as supernatant from hybrid cells (American Type Culture Collection,
Rockville, MD). Antibodies B133.1, B133.3, B133.5, and B133.7 (all IgGI) react specifi-
cally with human IFN-T but not with IFN-a or -/3(42). Ascites fluid from antibody B133.3,
1.5 x 107 neutralizing U/ml, was diluted 1:200 for pretreatment (6 h, 4°C) of PHA-CM.
Antibodies reacting with human LT (LTB, 5.5 x 10=neutralizing U/~,g) and human TNF
(TNFD, 2.7 × 103 neutralizing U/ug) were kindly provided by Dr. H. M. Shepard
(Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and used at concentrations of 5 #g/ml for
pretreatment (6 h, 4°C) of PHA-CM.
Recombinant IFN-y. Purified human rIFN-?, produced in E. coli and having a titer of
7 x 10? antiviral U/rag, was kindly provided by Dr. J. C. Sevastopoulos and H. M.
Shepard (Genentech, Inc.). Antiviral titer was periodically assayed as previously described
(31). rIFN-? had no colony-stimulating activity on normal bone marrow cells nor LT
activity on L-929 cells.
Bone Marrow Cell Preparations. Fragments of rib bone marrow, which are routinely
removed during thoracic surgery (kindly provided by Dr. P. Addonizio, Dept. of Surgery,
University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA), were collected in sterile RPMI-I 0% FCS.
The specimen was sequentially flushed with medium through 18-, 23-, and 27-gauge

needles, and mononuclear cells were isolated on Ficoll/Hypaque (F/H) (1.077 +_ 0.01
g/ml; Lymphoprep, Nyegaard and Co., Oslo, Norway) density gradient centrifugation.
Bone Marrow Colonies. The assay for CFU-GM was a modification of the method
described by Pike and Robinson (43). Medium conditioned by the human monocyte-like
cell line GCT (giant cell tumor) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) was used as a source of colony-
stimulating activity (44). GCT-CM contained neither IFN-% as measured by radioimmu-
noassay (RIA), nor LT, as measured on L-929 cells. Mononuclear bone marrow cells were
suspended (10"~cells/ml) in supplemented McCoy's medium (Gibco) containing 15% FCS,
0.3% agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, M1), and 10% GCT-CM (unless indicated other-
wise), and 1-mlaliquots were seeded into 35-mm Petri dishes (Flow Laboratories). Dishes
were cuhured at 37°C in a humidified 7% CO2 incubator and the colonies (aggregates
containing >40 cells) were counted at days 7 and 14 of culture. The colonies present after
7 d of culture are derived from more mature GM precursor cells (late CFU-GM), while
those present after 14 days are derived from more primitive cells (early CFU-GM) (45).
All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the same lots of FCS and GCT-CM
were used throughout. Inhibition of CFU-GM by PHA-CM, by its fractions prepared as
described below, or by lymphokines was tested by adding, at the time of seeding, 100/tl
of medium containing the inhibitors to 1-ml aliquots of bone marrow cell suspension, and
comparing the number of day 7 and day 14 CFU-GM to control plates. The presence of
colony-stimulating activity was assayed by adding 100 ul of PHA-CM or its fractions to
bone marrow cell cultures in the absence of GCT-CM.
Preparation of Peripheral Blood Cells. Peripheral blood was obtained by venipuncture
from healthy donors and anticoagulated with preservative-free heparin. Mononuclear
cells were isolated using F/H density gradient centrifugation. Adherent cells were removed
by two steps of adherence to plastic (45 rain at 37°C) to obtain nonadherent PBL.
Adherent cells were collected by scraping the plastic flasks with a rubber policeman.
OKT3 +and OKT3- lymphocytes were obtained by indirect rosetting of OKT3-sensitized
PBL with CrC13-treated, goat anti-mouse Ig-coated sheep erythrocytes (E), followed by
separation on an F/H gradient, as previously described (46, 47).
Preparation of PHA-CM. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells or purified lymphocyte
subsets were cultured at a concentration of 2 x 106 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 containing
1% FCS and 1% PHA (Wellcome Diagnostics, Dartford, England) for 4 d at 37°C, in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Autologous adherent cells were added at a final
concentration of 105 cells/ml, where indicated. Cell-free supernatants were collected and
stored at 4°C until use.
Absorption of lFN-Tfrom PHA-CM. mAb B133.1, B133.3, B133.5, and B133.7, react-
ing with different epitopes of human IFN-"F (42), were conjugated to CNBr-activated
Sepharose 4 B beads (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden) (50% ammonium
sulfate precipitate, 5 mg/ml gel). IFN--y was absorbed from PHA-CM by repeated mixing
of PHA-CM with the antibody-coated Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4°C. In all experiments,
the IFN-'7-dep[eted PHA-CM contained <1.5 U/ml of IFN-~ as measured with RIA
described below.
Chromatographic Fractionation of PHA-CM. PHA-CM was concentrated 100-fold by an
Amicon 8050 stirred cell equipped with a PM-10 membrane (Amicon Corporation,
Danvers, MA). 2-ml samples were applied to a Sephadex G-100 (Pharmacia Fine Chemi-
cals) column with a bed volume of 400 ml, and eluted with 0.1% PEG 8,000 (Fisher
Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) in PBS, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 40 ml/h. 24 10-ml fractions
were eluted in the molecular weight range between 10,000 and 160,000, supplemented
with 10% FCS, dialyzed twice against PBS, pH 7.4, once against RPMI-1640, and sterile-
filtered. Molecular weight markers, run on the column under identical conditions,
included IgG (158,000), BSA (67,000), ovalbumin (44,000), and myoglobin (17,000) (Bio-
Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA).
Production and Purification of Human LT. RPMI-8866 cells were suspended (106
cells/ml) in serum-free RPMI containing 100 ng/ml of phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PdBU)
(C.C.R., Inc., Eden Prairie, NM) and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 48 h. The cell-free
supernatants were harvested and concentrated 100-fold using a Diaflo hollow-fiber car-
266 LYMPHOKINES INHIBIT HEMATOPOIETIC COLONY FORMATION
tridge (HIP 10-20; Amicon Corp., Danvers, MA) and a stirred cell (PM 10 membrane;
Amicon Corp.), and filtered through a 0.45 um filter (Nalge Co., Rochester, NY). The
protein concentrate was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris HCI buffer, pH 7.8. This buffer,
and all other buffers used for purification, also contained 0.1% PEG 8,000 and 0.1 mM
PMSF (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Lquis, MO). After dialysis, the concentrate was applied
to a DEAE-Sepharose (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals) column. Elution was carried out with
120 ml of a linear (0-0.4 M) NaCI gradient. LT-active fractions, determined by cytotox-
icity on L-929 cells, were pooled and applied to a lentil-lectin Sepharose 4 B (Pharmacia
Fine Chemicals) column. LT activity was eluted with 15 mM sodium phosphate buffer,
pH 7.4, containing 135 mM NaC1 and 200 mM c~-methylmannoside (Sigma Chemical
Co.), dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCI buffer, pH 8.0, applied to a Blue-Sepharose CL-6
B (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals) column, and eluted with 50 mM NaCl. The eluate was
concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration (PM 10 membrane; Amicon Corp.), applied to an
Ultragel AcA44 (LKB Instruments, Gaithersburg, MD) column and eluted with 15 mM
sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 135 mM NaC1, at a flow rate of 15 ml/h.
LT-active fractions were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.8, loaded on a Mono Q
(Pharmacia Fine Chemicals) column equipped on a fast protein liquid chromatography
(FPLC) system (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals), and eluted with 10 ml of a linear (0-0.25 M)
NaCI gradient. The resulting.protein was 200-fold purified with a 23% recovery of activity
and had a final act of 8 x 105 U/rag protein.
Assayfor LT Activity. Serial dilutions of PHA-CM or fractions from the G-100 column
were added to 3 x 104 mouse L-929 cells (alpha subline) per well in 96-well flat-bottomed
microtiter plates in the presence of 1 ~g/ml actinomycin D (Calbiochem-Behring Corp.,
San Diego, CA). Cytotoxicity, identified by rounding-up and detachment of cells, was
assessed microscopically after incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. The concentration (U/ml) of
LT for each sample was defined as the reciprocal of the dilution that produced 50%
cytotoxicity.
IFN-y RIA. Antibody B133.5 was labeled with Na~25I (sp act 13-17 mCi/ug; Amer-
sham Corp., Amersham, United Kingdom) using the chloramine T method (48) (1 mCi
~2~Iper 20 ug protein). Antibody B133.1, (5 •g/ml in 0.1 M carbonate buffer, pH 9.5)
was absorbed (100 #l/well, 48 h at 4°C) to 96-well vinyl plates (Serocluster; Costar,
Cambridge, MA). The plates were washed three times with cold PBS containing 0.05%
Tween 20 (Bio-Rad Laboratories) (PBS-Tween), and 100 ~1 of test sample was added to
triplicate wells and incubated 18 h at 4°C. Plates were washed three times with PBS-
Tween, 125I-labeled antibody B13B.5 was added (0.2 ug/ml, 100 ~l/wetl) to each well, and
the plates were incubated 18 h at 4°C. The plates were then washed six times with cold
PBS-Tween, dried, and the well-bound radioactivity was measured in a Packard Auto-
Gamma 800 automated gamma counter (Packard Instrument Co., Downers Grove, IL).
The IFN-y concentrations in the test samples were determined on the basis of a standard
curve, constructed in each experiment using a laboratory standard of purified natural
human IFN-y (Interferon Sciences, New Brunswick, NJ), previously titered against the
NIH 1FN-3~standard Gg-23-901-530. The sensitivity of this RIA is 0.5 U/ml of IFN-y.
Results
Supernatantsfrom PHA-stimulated Lymphocytes or T Cells Contain Both Stimulatory
and Inhibitory Activity on CFU-GM. As has been reported previously, PHA-CM
contained both stimulatory (3) and inhibitory (25, 26) activity for CFU-GM.
PHA-CM added to bone marrow cell cultures in the absence of GCT-CM
displayed significant colony-stimulating activity for day 14 CFU-GM, but not for
day 7 CFU-GM. PHA added at a concentration equal to that present in PHA-
CM showed no stimulation of colonies under these conditions. Final concentra-
tions of 10% PHA-CM, added to bone marrow cell cultures in the presence of
GCT-CM as a source of colony-stimulating activity, inhibited day 7 CFU-GM by
42-75%, and significant inhibition was observed at concentrations of PHA-CM

Cells were cultured (2 X l0s cells/ml) in medium containing 1% FCS and 1% PHA. After 4 d,
supernatants were collected and tested for colony-inhibitingand colony-stimulatingactivity, IFN-
"y,and LT. All results are expressed as the mean + SD from four experiments.
* Autologous adherent mononuclear cells were added (105 cells/ml) to cell cultures, where indicated.
Supernatants were added (100/~l/dish) to bone marrow cultures in the presence of 10% GCT-CM.
Percent inhibition was determined by comparing the number of colonies in test cultures to the
number of colonies in control plates to which 100/~l/dish of culture medium was added. CFU-GM
per 105 cells in control plates for day 7 and day 14 were 138 + 40 and 60 + 19, respectively.

as low as 1%. Inhibition of day 14 CFU-GM ranged from 17 to 36% when PHA-
CM was present at 10% final concentration.
To determine which cell types produce the inhibitory and stimulatory effects
present in PHA-CM, nonadherent PBL from four donors were separated into T
(OKT3 +) and non-T (OKT3-) cells by indirect rosetting. The separated popu-
lations, with or without the addition of autologous adherent cells, were cultured
in the presence or absence of PHA for 4 d, and the cell-free supernatants were
assayed for stimulation or inhibition of day 7 and day 14 CFU-GM, and for titers
of IFN-'y and LT (Table I). Supernatants from separated populations cultured
for 4 d in the absence of PHA did not contain significant levels of colony-
inhibiting or colony-stimulating activity, or of IFN-7 or LT (data not shown).
Upon stimulation with PHA, lymphocyte populations produced all four of the
activities measured, although there was variability in the amounts produced by
different donors. Colony-stimulating acuvity, which was active only on day 14
CFU-GM, was produced by all lymphocyte populations. Adherent cells alone did
not produce colony-stimulating activity, but when added to lymphocyte cultures,
they enhanced its production. Supernatants from PHA-stimulated OKT3 + PBL
mediated the highest levels of inhibition of both day 7 and day 14 CFU-GM.
The addition of autologous adherent cells to cultures of PHA-stimulated OKT3 ÷
or total PBL resulted in increased ability of the supernatant from the cultures to
inhibit day 7 CFU-GM, but decreased its ability to inhibit day 14 CFU-GM.

FIGURE 1. Effect of IFN-7-depletion on the ability of PHA-CM to inhibit day 7 CFU-GM.
IFN-7 was absorbed from three separate PHA-CM preparations using anti-IFN-~ antibody-
coated Sepharose. Culture medium, l0s U/ml rIFN-% PHA-CM,and IFN-~,-depletedPHA-

adherent cells, showed low levels of inhibition of day 7 CFU-GM and did not
inhibit day 14 CFU-GM. IFN-y was produced by all lymphocyte populations,
but PHA-stimulated total PBL produced more IFN-y than either OKT3 + or
OKT3- PBL. LT activity was detected in supernatants from total PBL, and was
two- to threefold enriched in supernatants from OKT3 + PBL. OKT3- PBL and
adherent cells produced very low or insignificant levels of LT.
IFN-'y Synergizes with Other Factor(s) Present in PHA-CM to Inhibit CFU-
GM. IFN-y was absorbed by immunoaffinity chromatography from three dif-
ferent preparations of PHA-CM, and the IFN-'r-depleted PHA-CM preparations
were assayed for inhibition of day 7 CFU-GM with or without the addition of
103 U/ml rIFN-y (Fig. 1). The final concentration of 103 U/ml rIFN-y is in
excess of the concentration present in bone marrow cultures when 10% PHA-
CM, not depleted of IFN-y, is added. The inhibition of CFU-GM mediated by
PHA-CM at 10% final concentration was completely abrogated after absorption
of IFN-y from the supernatants. When 103 U/ml rIFN-y were added to the
cultures together with the IFN-y-depleted PHA-CM, the inhibition of CFU-GM
was significantly higher than that caused by 103 U/ml rIFN-y alone, suggesting
that IFN-y synergizes with another factor(s) present in PHA-CM to inhibit CFU-
GM. Synergy between IFN-y and IFN-y-depleted PHA-CM is also observed at
lower concentrations of IFN-y, which show very little inhibition on their own
(Fig. 2).
The Colony-inhibiting Activity Present in PHA-CM Elutes from a Sephadex C-lO0
Column in Fractions Containing Both IFN-y and LT Activities. PHA-CM fractions
obtained on a Sephadex G-100 column were assayed for inhibition and stimula-
tion of CFU-GM, IFN-y, and LT activity. Fig. 3 illustrates the results from one
such fractionation, representative of four experiments. The highest levels of
inhibition of day 7 CFU-GM eluted in fractions corresponding to a molecular
weight range between 45,000 and 80,000 (Fig. 3A). Colony-stimulating activity

between 10,000 and 30,000 (Fig. 3A). In some experiments, low levels of colony
formation or cluster formation (<40 cells) was also observed when fractions
eluting in higher molecular weight ranges were added to cultures (not shown).
The peak of IFN-3' activity eluted at 45,000 tool wt, while most of the LT activity
was eluted in fractions with a molecular weight of 85,000-120,000 (Fig. 3B).
Thus, fractions exerting the highest levels of inhibition do not coincide with
either the peak of IFN-3, or the peak of LT, but rather with fractions containing
low levels of both activities.

two lymphokines, all fractions were tested in the presence of excess LT (10
U/ml), purified from RPMI-8866 supernatants, or excess IFN-~ (10~U/ml rIFN-
y) (Fig. 4). If inhibition requires the presence of both factors, under such
conditions, the inhibitory activity is expected to coelute with the lymphokine
present at limiting levels. When excess LT was added to the cultures, the peak
of colony-inhibition corresponded to the elution peak of IFN-3' (Fig. 4B), and
likewise, when excess IFN-'/ was added, the peak of colony inhibition corre-
sponded to the elution peak of LT (Fig. 4C). Consistent with the results in Fig.
3, when fractions alone were added to the CFU-GM assay (Fig. 4A), the peak
colony-inhibiting activity was present in fractions containing both IFN-'r and LT
(Fig. 4D).

preparations were treated with mAb against IFN-'y, LT, or TNF, and then tested
for their ability to inhibit colony formation by day 7 and day 14 CFU-GM.
Incubation of PHA-CM with antibody against either IFN-y or LT abrogated its
inhibitory activity, although a low level of inhibition of day 7 CFU-GM remained
in some preparations after treatment with anti-LT antibody. Antibody against
TNF did not abolish inhibition. Identical results were obtained using the gel

did not affect the number of colonies produced (not shown).
Purified LT and Recombinant IFN-3, Synergize to Inhibit Day 7 and Day 14 CFU-
GM. To determine whether the synergy between LT and IFN-'y is sufficient to
explain the strong inhibition of CFU-GM mediated by PHA-CM, we tested
purified preparations of LT and rIFN-'y for their ability to inhibit colony
formation. The purified LT preparation used in these experiments had asp act
of 8 x 105 U/mg, as measured by cytotoxicity on L-929 cells, and its activity was
abolished by the same mAb (LTB) that abrogated LT activity in PHA-CM (Table
II). Fig. 5 shows results of an experiment in which various concentrations of
purified LT were added to bone marrow cells, either in the presence or absence
of 103 U/ml rIFN-3,. LT alone at concentrations of 5 and 10 U/ml exerted
modest inhibition on day 7 CFU-GM, but did not inhibit day 14 CFU°GM even
at concentrations of 10 U/ml When rIFN-3, was present in addition to LT,
inhibition was greatly enhanced. Treatment of bone marrow cells with 103 U/ml
rIFN-3, alone produced 30% inhibition of day 7 CFU-GM; however, the com-
bined effects of rIFN-3, and LT was more than additive for all LT concentrations
tested. Neither 103 U/ml rIFN3, nor 10 U/ml of LT inhibited day 14 CFU-GM,
but 65% inhibition was observed when the two factors were combined.
Discussion
Conditioned medium from mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes has been observed
to contain colony-inhibiting (25, 26) and colony-stimulating activity (3, 49), IFN-
~/(42, 50, 51), and LT (35). The cell separation experiments reported here show
that OKT3 + lymphocytes (T cells), and not OKT3- lymphocytes (non-T cells) or
adherent mononuclear cells are the most effective producers of these activities
upon PHA stimulation. Mitogen-stimulated T cells produced colony-stimulating
activity for day 14 but not for day 7 CFU-GM, whereas the colony-inhibiting
activity present in supernatants of both T and non-T lymphocytes appeared to
be most potent for the day 7 CFU-GM. The presence of granulocyte/macrophage
colony stimulating factors (GM-CSF) has been observed in PHA-CM (49). One

type of GM-CSF, GM-CSFa, which stimulates colony formation by day 14 CFU-
GM (52), is probably responsible for the colony-stimulating activity present
in our supernatants. Despite the presence of colony-stimulating activity for day
14 CFU-GM, supernatants from PHA-stimulated T cells inhibited day 14 CFU-
GM in the presence of 10% GCT-CM, suggesting that the inhibitory substances
released by T cells override the influences of CSF, and are therefore the more
potent regulators of GM colony formation contained in supernatants from PHA-
stimulated T cells. Supernatants from mitogen-stimulated non-T cells (predom-
inantly B and NK cells) contained very low levels of LT and approximately
threefold less IFN--y than did T cell supernatants; they did not inhibit day 14
CFU-GM, and only poorly inhibited day 7 CFU-GM. The IFN-3, present in the
non-T lymphocyte supernatants may be a product of NK cells, whicb have been
shown to produce IFN-3' upon stimulation with PHA (53) or IL-2 (42). Produc-
tion of IFN-3, by NK cells after stimulation by PHA or T cell-derived IL-2 might
also explain the higher titers of IFN-3' present in supernatants from total PBL
than in supernatants from purified T cells.
The inability of IFN-3,-depleted PHA-CM to inhibit colony formation shows
that IFN-'y is essential for PHA-CM-induced inhibition of CFU-GM. However,
IFN-3' alone is not sufficient to explain the potent inhibition caused by PHA-
CM. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, l0 s U/ml of rIFN-2/, a concentration of IFN-3~
~20-fold higher than that present in cultures containing 10% PHA-CM inhibits
colonies significantly less than either 10% PHA-CM or IFN-'y-depleted PHA-CM
to which 103 U/ml of rIFN-3' was added. These data suggest that IFN-3' acts
together with other factor(s) present in PHA-CM to inhibit CFU-GM.
Our observation that IFN-'r alone mediates only minimal inhibition of CFU-
MURPHY ET AL. 273
GM contrasts with other studies (26-30, 54) in which strong inhibition of CFU-
GM by |FN-3~ was reported. The purified preparations of natural IFN-3' used in
early studies (26, 54) may have contained contaminating LT, as shown by Stone-
Wolff et al. (38), in amounts sufficient to synergize with IFN-~ in inhibiting
CFU-GM. The ability of antibodies against IFN-3, to completely block CFU-GM
inhibition by IFN-3' preparations (54) does not rule out the possibility that
contaminating LT is also responsible for inhibition, as we have observed complete
abrogation of inhibition by LT-containing PHA-CM using an mAb against IFN-
3'. More recent reports (27-30) show that purified, homogeneous rIFN-% at
concentrations lower than those used in this report, is still capable of inhibiting
CFU-GM, although to a lower degree than was shown using purified natural
IFN-% We attribute the differences with our results to the different source and
concentration of colony-stimulating activity, especially when using PHA-CM (28)
or human placental-conditioned medium (29), which may also contain LT or
TNF. The colony-stimulating activity (GCT-CM) used in our experiments did
not contain IFN-3, or LT activity, as measured by RIA or cytotoxicity on L-929
cells, respectively. Differences in the methods used for purification of bone
marrow cells have also been shown to influence the sensitivity of precursor cells
to IFN-'r (55), and may explain the difference between our results and those of
Griffin et al. (27) who report 58% inhibition of day 14 CFU-GM with 500 U/ml
of rIFN-3' using partially purified progenitor cell preparations.
Fractionation of PHA-CM revealed that the fractions most active in inhibiting
CFU-GM were those corresponding to mol wt between 45,000 and 80,000, in
which botb IFN-~ and LT activity were present. IFN-'y eluted in a broad peak
of mol wt between 30,000 and 70,000, with the highest levels of activity eluting
at tool wt of ~45,000. This tool wt is consistent with other measurements of
IFN-3, by gel filtration (56). The peak LT activity eluted in the range of 85,000-
120,000 tool wt. Analysis of LT by gel filtration has shown molecular weight
heterogeneity of the LT molecule (57, 58), probably due to a strong tendency
ofa monomeric 25,000 mol wt form to aggregate into polymers (59). The elution
pattern observed in our fractionations is consistent with that of c~-LT described
by Granger et al. (57). We also observed low levels of LT activity in the tool wt
range of 50,000-65,000, which is similar to the LT partially purified from PHA-
CM by Stone-Wolff et al. (38), or with the LT purified from supernatants of the
B lymphoblastoid cell line RPMI-1788 (36, 60). Although variability among
different PHA-CM preparations was also observed for the titers of ]FN-'y
produced, the peak of colony-inhibiting activity always eluted in fractions con-
taining low levels of both IFN-3, and LT. This elution pattern suggested that
both IFN-~ and LT are necessary for inhibition of CFU-GM. The results of the
experiments in which excess LT or excess IFN-3' was added to PHA-CM fractions
supports the conclusion that inhibition of CFU-GM is observed wherever ade-
quate amounts of both activities are present. The ability of mAb against either
LT or IFN-3, to almost completely abrogate PHA-CM-induced inhibition of
CFU-GM establishes that both LT and IFN-3' are required for this activity. The
low level of inhibition remaining in some supernatants after treatment with anti-
LT antibody could be attributed to IFN-3' alone, which at high concentrations
is capable of inhibiting day 7 CFU-GM (Figs. 1 and 2). Anti-TNF antibody had
274 LYMPHOKINESINHIBIT HEMATOPOIET1C COLONY FORMATION
no effect on inhibition, indicating that LT and not TNF, a cytokine that we have
previously shown to inhibit CFU-GM (31), and which may be produced by the
monocytes or NK cells present in the mononuclear cell preparations (38, 61), is
responsible for the CFU-GM inhibition mediated by PHA-CM. The negative
results obtained with the anti-TNF antibody cannot be attributed to inactivity of
the antibody, because the same preparations of antibody were effective in
abrogating the colony-inhibiting activity of NK cell-derived supernatants (31).
We used rIFN-'y and purified LT preparations to show that these two factors
together are capable of strong inhibition of CFU-GM in the absence of other
factors that might be present in PHA-CM. Like IFN-3,, LT is capable of only
minimal inhibition of day 7 CFU-GM at concentrations (10 U/ml) in excess of
those present when 10% PHA-CM is added to bone marrow cells. However, LT,
at concentrations as low as 0.6 U/ml, when added together with 103 U/ml of
rIFN-% showed significant inhibition of both day 7 and day 14 CFU-GM.
Unfractionated PHA-CM preparations did not strongly inhibit day 14 CFU-GM,
probably due to colony-stimulating activity for day 14 CFU-GM contained in
PHA-CM. This interpretation is supported by the observations that supernatants
from PHA-stimulated lymphocytes produced in the presence of adherent cells
contain more colony-stimulating activity (6, 62) and less inhibitory activity for
day 14 CFU-GM than supernatants produced without added adherent cells.
Conversely, gel filtration fractions containing LT and IFN-% but not colony-
stimulating activity strongly inhibit both day 7 and day 14 CFU-GM. Thus, the
low levels of LT contained in PHA-CM, acting together with IFN-'y, are sufficient
to explain the PHA-CM-induced inhibition of both day 7 and day 14 CFU-GM.
The mechanism by which IFN-'f and LT act together to inhibit CFU-GM is
unknown. Studies of the synergistic interaction between these two factors on the
cytotoxicity of cell lines have shown that the cytostatic or cytotoxic effects of LT
are enhanced when target cells are pretreated with IFN-'r (39), suggesting that
IFN-y may act by priming the target cells to the effect of LT. The increased
sensitivity of IFN-treated target cells to LT or TNF may be due to the ability of
IFN-y to increase the number of receptors for these cytokines (63, 64). A similar
mechanism may be operative on granulocyte and monocyte precursor cells. Our
data, however, do not exclude the possibility that IFN-'y and/or LT act indirectly
on precursor cells through other bone marrow cell types that might regulate
precursor cell growth.
LT and TNF share the ability to induce tumor necrosis and cytotoxicity of
cell lines (60); however, our data indicate that they may not behave identically
in their colony-inhibiting activities. We have previously reported (31) that rTNF,
at the same low concentrations used for LT in these experiments, is capable of
significant inhibition of day 14 CFU-GM in the absence of IFN-3,. In the present
experiments, purified LT had very little colony-inhibiting activity in the absence
of IFN-3,. Equivalent concentrations of LT and TNF, however, are capable of
synergizing with IFN-'y to inhibit day 7 CFU-GM. These distinct properties of
LT and TNF probably do not depend on variability in sensitivity to cytokines
among bone marrow donors, because the same effects were observed when
purified LT and rTNF were simultaneously tested for colony-inhibiting activity.
We have shown that activated T cells produce a variety of soluble factors that,
MURPHY ET AL. 275
together, influence the growth and differentiation of granulocyte and monocyte
precursor cells. We have also identified a mechanism whereby activated T cells,
associated with certain forms of bone marrow failure, might suppress hemato-
poiesis through the simultaneous release of IFN-y and LT.
Summary
We have shown that lymphocytes stimulated by PHA produce colony-forming
unit of granulocyte/monocyte (CFU-GM)-stimulating and -inhibiting activities,
IFN-% and lymphotoxin (LT). IFN-7 is necessary for inhibition of CFU-GM by
PHA-conditioned medium (CM), as shown by experiments in which removal of
IFN-y from PHA-CM abrogated inhibition. However, experiments in which
rIFN-y was added to IFN-y-depleted PHA-CM revealed the presence, in PHA-
CM, of other factors that act in synergy with IFN-y to inhibit CFU-GM.
Fractionation of PHA-CM on a Sephadex G-100 column was used to separate
IFN-3' and LT. Colony-inhibiting activity was eluted in fractions that contained
both IFN-y and LT activities, identifying LT as a factor present in PHA-CM
that synergizes with IFN-y to inhibit CFU-GM. Treatment of PHA-CM with
mAb against either IFN-y or LT completely abrogated the colony-inhibiting
activity, demonstrating a requirement for both lymphokines in PHA-CM-induced
inhibition of CFU-GM. Experiments using rIFN-y and preparations of purified
LT confirmed that neither lymphokine alone, when added to bone marrow cells
at the concentrations present in PHA-CM, strongly inhibited day 7 or day 14
CFU-GM, but that the two lymphokines, added together, behaved synergistically
to inhibit CFU-GM by up to 70%. The inhibition observed using purified
preparations of lymphokines shows that synergy between IFN-y and LT is
sufficient to explain PHA-CM-induced inhibition of CFU-GM. Our findings
suggest that activated T cells regulate hematopoiesis through the release of
inhibitory as well as stimulatory factors, and that the simultaneous production of
IFN-~, and LT may represent a mechanism of suppression of hematopoiesis in
the cases of bone marrow failure associated with the presence of activated T
cells.
