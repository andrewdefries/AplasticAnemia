Abstract
Background: In August 2002, the antifungal prophylaxis algorithm for neutropenic hematology/
oncology (NHO) patients at the Medical Center was changed from conventional amphotericin
(AMB) to an azole (AZ) based regimen (fluconazole [FLU] in low-risk and voriconazole [VOR] in
high-risk patients). The aim of our study was to compare outcomes associated with the two
regimens, including breakthrough fungal infection, adverse drug events, and costs.
Methods: Adult, non-febrile, NHO patients who received prophylactic AMB from 8/01/01-7/30/
02 or AZ from 8/01/02-7/30/03 were retrospectively evaluated.
Results: A total of 370 patients (AMB: n = 181; AZ: n = 216) associated with 580 hospitalizations
(AMB: n = 259; AZ: n = 321) were included. The incidence of probable/definite breakthrough
Aspergillus infections was similar among regimens (AMB: 1.9% vs AZ: 0.6%; p=0.19). A greater
incidence of mild/moderate (24.7% vs. 5.3%; p < 0.0001) and severe renal dysfunction (13.5% vs.
4.4%; p < 0.0012) was observed with AMB. In contrast, patients treated with VOR were found to
have an increased rate of severe hepatic toxicity (32.5%) compared with patients treated with
either AMB (22.6%) or FLU (21.4%) (p = 0.05). While the AZ period was associated with a >$9,000
increase in mean total costs/hospitalization, the mean acquisition cost associated with AZ was only
$947/hospitalization more than AMB.
Conclusion: While an AZ-based regimen is associated with increased cost, the reduced rate of
nephrotoxicity and availability of oral dosage forms, suggests that azoles be used preferentially over
AMB. However, an increased rate of severe hepatic toxicity may be associated with VOR.
Background
Invasive fungal infection due to Candida and Aspergillus is
associated with increased morbidity and mortality in neu-
tropenic hematology and oncology (NHO) patients.
Amphotericin B (AMB) is a broad-spectrum antifungal
agent used for prophylaxis of fungal infections in neutro-
penic hematology/oncology patients. However, conven-
tional AMB is associated with an increased risk of

infusion-related reactions and renal toxicity. Prospective,
randomized, controlled trials have demonstrated that flu-
conazole (FLU) and voriconazole (VOR) are safe and
effective alternatives to AMB in febrile, neutropenic
patients and fluconazole has been found to be an effective
prophylactic agent in neutropenia [1-4]. The Centers for
Disease Control, Infectious Disease Society of America,
and American Society of Blood and Bone Marrow Trans-
plantation currently recommend FLU for the prevention
of candidiasis for patients undergoing hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation [5]. Of concern, FLU has inade-
quate activity versus Aspergillus spp. Although VOR has
adequate activity versus Aspergillus spp, it is currently not
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in
febrile neutropenia. However, Walsh et al. (2002) demon-
strated that VOR was superior to liposomal AMB in reduc-
ing documented breakthrough fungal infections (p =
0.02), severe infusion-related toxicity (p < 0.01), and
renal toxicity (p < 0.001) in patients with febrile neutro-
penia [2]. Based on the results of this study, in August
2002, the University of California at San Francisco
(UCSF) antifungal prophylaxis regimen was changed
from conventional AMB to an azole-based regimen that
included FLU and VOR. The objectives of this study were
to compare the rate of breakthrough fungal infection,
adverse drug events and costs associated with these pro-
phylactic regimens.
Methods
Patients
Eligibility criteria
The UCSF Committee on Human Research approved the
study. All patients were treated at the UCSF Medical
Center. Adult neutropenic (defined as an absolute neu-
trophil count < 500 cells/mm3) hematology/oncology
patients who received conventional AMB prophylaxis
from August 1, 2001 through July 30, 2002, or who
received FLU or VOR prophylaxis from August 1, 2002 to
July 30, 2003, were included. During the AZ period, low-
risk patients, defined as leukemics or those receiving
autologous transplant, received prophylaxis with FLU.
High-risk patients, defined as those receiving allogeneic
stem cell transplants, received prophylaxis with VOR.
Patients were excluded if they received azoles or AMB for
reasons other than prophylaxis.
Administration of Study Medications
In accordance with the UCSF antifungal prophylaxis algo-
rithm, from August 1, 2001 through July 30, 2002, NHO
patients received conventional intravenous AMB 0.3 mg/
kg/day initially titrated to 0.7 mg/kg/day as tolerated.
From August 1, 2002 to July 30, 2003, low-risk NHO
patients received FLU 400 mg by mouth daily and high-
risk patients received VOR 200 mg by mouth twice daily.
If unable to tolerate oral medications, patients could
receive either FLU (400 mg/daily) or VOR 200 mg every
12 hrs intravenously.
Study Design
This investigation was a retrospective, observational,
cohort study. Non-blinded reviews of patients' electronic
files at UCSF, the pharmacy acquisition cost database, and
the medical center cost accounting system were con-
ducted. Collected information included: gender, age,
diagnosis, cost of hospitalization (including pharmacy,
chemistry laboratory, and hemodialysis), length of hospi-
tal stay, renal toxicity, hepatotoxicity, breakthrough fun-
gal infections, hemodialysis (HD) requirements, reason
for HD, and modification of antifungal prophylaxis.
Duration of antifungal prophylaxis was calculated by the
number of days from the start of therapy to discharge.
Diagnoses were condensed into the following groups:
Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (including
Burkitt's lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, T cell lym-
phoma, angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy, aggres-
sive B-cell lymphoma, natural killer cell lymphoma, and
cutaneous T-cell anaplastic lymphoma), myeloid neo-
plasms (including acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic
myelogenous leukemia, myelofibrosis, and myelodys-
plastic syndrome), lymphocytic leukemia (including
acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia), multiple mye-
loma, and other hematologic disorders/malignancies
(including anaplastic plasmacytoma, aplastic anemia,
amyloidosis, and light chain deposition disease).
Efficacy assessment
The definitions of possible, probable, and definite break-
through fungal infections were based upon clinical con-
sensus guidelines on opportunistic fungal infections in
cancer patients and stem cell recipients [6].
Safety assessment
Renal and hepatic toxicity were defined as per previous
published trials of AMB, FLU, and VOR [2-4,7,8]. Mild to
moderate renal toxicity was defined as >0.4 mg/dL
increase in serum creatinine (Scr). Severe renal dysfunc-
tion was defined as at least a doubling of the Scr level (or
an increase of at least 1 mg/dL if the base line was above
upper normal limits).
Hospitalizations associated with acute HD or continuous
veno-venohemofiltration (CVVH) were identified using
billing codes. The patient's electronic files were further
reviewed to determine etiology of renal failure and con-
firm the mode of dialysis.
Mild to moderate hepatic toxicity was defined as a tripling
of the baseline value of serum aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), or serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or serum

alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) or a 1.5-fold increase in
serum total bilirubin during therapy. Severe hepatic toxic-
ity was defined as at least a five-fold increase in the base-
line value of AST, ALT, or Alk Phos or a three-fold increase
in serum total bilirubin during therapy.
Cost Analysis
Total hospital costs represent the UCSF cost of providing
service and do not reflect charges or reimbursement. TSI
(Transition System Inc., Eclipsys) was used to determine
total, pharmacy and laboratory costs for all patients.
Statistical Analysis
Due to multiple hospitalizations for patients, continuous
variables (age, length of stay, duration of therapy, baseline
and peak lab values [Scr, AST, ALT, Alk Phos, T bili], costs)
were analyzed using mixed effects logistic regression.
Some of these variables (length of stay, duration of ther-
apy, costs) were then log transformed to improve the dis-
tribution. These models controlled for the number of
hospitalizations and include fixed effects for each medica-
tion and for each period.
Similarly, discrete variables (rates of infection, renal toxic-
ity, hepatic toxicity) were analyzed using random effects
logistic regression. These models controlled for the
number of hospitalizations and include fixed effects for
each medication and for each period.
Multi-variable analyses were conducted for the outcome
of total costs using mixed effects regression models that
controlled for age, diagnoses, therapy (allogeneic trans-
plant, autologous transplant, chemotherapy, other diag-
noses), and duration of antifungal prophylaxis. The cost
variables were then log transformed to improve the distri-
bution. Multi-variable analyses were also conducted for
the outcome of all fungal infection using random effects
regression models that controlled for age, diagnoses, ther-
apy (allogeneic transplant, autologous transplant, chemo-
therapy, other diagnoses), and duration of antifungal
prophylaxis. These models include fixed effects for each
medication and for each period.
Statistical significance was defined as a P value of < 0.05.

and VOR (high-risk patients) for 84 (26%) of the hospi-
talizations. During the AMB period, the majority of
patients were hospitalized either once (68.5%) or twice
(21.5%). Similarly, in the AZ period, most patients were
hospitalized once (FLU 74.3%; VOR 78.1%) or twice
(FLU 18.1%; VOR 12.5%). Twenty-seven patients were
treated during both periods. During the AZ period, 19
patients were treated with both FLU and VOR during mul-
tiple hospitalizations.
Patients in the AZ period were older than patients in the
AMB period (50.3 vs. 49.6 years of age, respectively; 95%
Confidence Interval [CI] -0.85 â -0.65, standard error [SE]
= 0.052, p < 0.001). The admitting diagnoses were similar
between periods; the majority of diagnoses were myelog-
enous neoplasms, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, lym-
phocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. Significantly
fewer patients in the AZ period underwent auto-trans-
plant (13% vs. 22%, OR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.42â0.95, p =
0.03). Otherwise, treatments (mini-transplant, allo-trans-
plant, chemotherapy, etc) were similar between periods
(p > 0.2). The following baseline lab values were similar
between the two periods: Scr (AZ 1.01 vs. AMB 0.97; 95%
CI 0.9 â 1.03, SE = 0.035, p = 0.28), AST (AZ 28.65 vs.
AMB 26.32; 95% CI 0.84 â 1.00, SE = 0.05 p = 0.08), ALT
(AZ 28.73 vs. AMB 27.85; 95% CI 0.84 â 1.12, SE = 0.07,
p = 0.67), Alk Phos (AZ 79.76 vs AMB 77.27; 95% CI 0.88
â 1.07, SE = 0.05, p = 0.51), and Tbili (AZ 0.74 vs. AMB
0.74; 95% CI 0.9 â 1.11, SE = 0.05, p = 0.98)
Patients in the AMB period received antifungal prophy-
laxis significantly earlier than patients in the AZ period
(1.8 vs. 3.9 days from admission to start of therapy; 95%
CI â 2.87 â -1.37, SE = 0.38, p < 0.001). The mean lengths
of stay were similar (19.2 days in the AZ period and 20.9
days in the AMB period; 95% CI = 8.9 â 17.4, SE = 1.16, p
= 0.21). Duration of antifungal prophylaxis was signifi-
cantly longer during the AMB period (19.8 days vs. 16.5
days; 95% CI 11.22 â 23.44, SE = 1.17, p = 0.009).
Breakthrough Fungal Infections
Overall, the incidence of breakthrough fungal infections
was similar in the AZ and AMB periods (13.7% vs. 10.4%
respectively; OR = 1.38, 95% CI 0.82 â 2.34, p = 0.23)
(Table 2). After multi-variable analyses controlling for
age, diagnoses, therapy (allogeneic transplant, autologous
transplant, chemotherapy, other diagnoses), and duration
of antifungal prophylaxis, the rate of breakthrough fungal
infection was similar during both the AZ and AMB period
(OR = 1.53, 95% CI 0.852 â 2.761, p = 0.15).
While not statistically significant, the rate of probable and
definite breakthrough fungal infections, including that
due to Aspergillus, was less during the AZ period (AZ
0.6% vs. AMB 1.9%; OR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.06 â 1.73, p =
0.19).
Three of the probable/definite Aspergillus infections in
the AMB period were fatal; neither of the probable/defi-
nite Aspergillus infections in the AZ period was fatal. Of
the two patients in the AZ period who developed a prob-
able/definite Aspergillus infection, one received FLU and
the other received VOR.
While infrequent, the rate of probable and definite Cand-
ida infections in the AMB and AZ periods was similar
between groups (1.5% vs. 1.6%, respectively; OR = 0.97,
95% CI 0.25 â 3.76, p = 0.97). During the AMB period,
probable breakthrough Candida infections included
hepatosplenic candidiasis (n = 1), esophagitis (n = 1), and
thrush (n = 2). In the AZ period, two cases of probable
Candida infections (oral candidiasis and one case of
splenic candidiasis were observed. The patient with prob-
able splenic candidiasis also had possible Aspergillus pul-
monary disease. Three cases of definite disseminated
fungal infections (Candida kruseii [n = 1] and Candida gla-
brata [n = 2]) were observed during the AZ period. One
patient with Candida glabrata sepsis had a concomitant
possible Aspergillus pneumonia. Of those patients with

breakthrough Candida fungal infection, all received
prophylaxis with FLU. No cases of breakthrough candi-
dal infection were observed with VOR prophylaxis.
Renal Dysfunction
Fewer hospitalizations in the AZ period were associated
with mild/moderate (AZ 5.3% vs. AMB 24.7%; OR = 0.18,
95% CI 0.11 â 0.3, p < 0.0001) and severe renal dysfunc-
tion (AZ 4.4% vs. AMB 13.5%; OR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.14 â
0.64, p < 0.0012). Hemodialysis requirements were infre-
quent during both time periods (AMB: 2.3%; AZ: 4%).
Eleven of 19 patients (58%) requiring HD were found to
be HD-dependent prior to admission. Two patients in the
AMB period and four patients in the AZ period developed
new onset renal failure requiring HD. Notably, one
patient in the AZ period was switched to lipid-based AMB
and subsequently developed acute renal failure requiring
HD.
Hepatic Toxicity
Serum AST, ALT, Alk Phos and T bili levels were available
for 540 hospitalizations (AMB = 243; FLU = 217; VOR =
80). The AZ period was associated with a lower incidence
of mild/moderate hepatic toxicity (AZ 33.7% vs. AMB
48.6%; OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.29 â 1.05, p = 0.03). The rate
of severe hepatic toxicity did not differ between periods
(AZ 21.4% vs. AMB 25.3%; OR = 1.23, 95% CI 0.81 â
2.03, p = 0.28). However, patients receiving VOR prophy-
laxis had a greater incidence of severe hepatic toxicity
when compared with those patients treated with either
AMB or FLU (32.5% vs. 21.4% vs. 22.6%, respectively; OR
= 1.91, 95% CI 1 â 3.64, p = 0.0507). Patients receiving
VOR (n = 80) experienced a higher average peak AST
(VOR 56 vs. FLU 39, 95% CI 1.2 â 1.8, SE = 0.1, p < 0.001;
VOR 56 vs. AMB 39, 95% CI 1.2 â 1.7, SE = 0.1, p < 0.001)
and ALT (VOR 70 vs. FLU 44, 95% CI 1.3 â 2.0, SE = 0.11,
p < 0.001; VOR 70 vs. AMB 50, 95% CI 1.1 â 1.8, SE =
0.11, p < 0.001).
Modification of Antifungal Prophylaxis
Modification of antifungal therapy took place more fre-
quently during the AZ period (AZ 13.1% vs. 23% AMB;
OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.3 â 3.69, p = 0.003). Modification
was most commonly associated with initial receipt of FLU
and resulted in a switch to VOR due to possible, probable
or definite breakthrough fungal infection (n = 25), devel-
opment of new neutropenic fevers (n = 36), and initiation
of high dose steroids (n = 1). There was no difference in
the rate of discontinuation between AMB and VOR
(13.1% vs. 11.9%, respectively p = 0.76). VOR prophy-
laxis was modified in response to elevated LFTs (n = 8),
QTC prolongation (n = 1), and for unknown reasons (n =
1). Modification of AMB to lipid-based AMB, itracona-
zole, FLU or VOR took place in response to an increasing
Scr (n = 18), anaphylactic reaction (n = 1), possible, prob-
able, or definite breakthrough fungal infection (n = 6),
development of new neutropenic fevers (n = 2), elevated
LFT's (n = 2), possible AMB associated bone marrow sup-
pression (n = 1), and unknown (n = 4).
Patients Treated in Both the AMB and AZ Periods
Twenty-seven patients, representing 82 hospitalizations,
were treated in both periods. These patients were deter-
mined to have similar rates of renal dysfunction, hepatic
dysfunction, and breakthrough fungal infections as those
patients solely treated in a single study period.
Cost Analysis
When the cost of the AZ period was compared to the AMB
period, a $9,128/hospitalization increase in the mean
total cost, $9,390/hospitalization increase in the mean
pharmacy costs, and $68/hospitalization increase in
mean laboratory costs was observed (Tables 3, 4). Multi-
variable analyses confirmed significantly less cost associ-
ated with AMB period (95% CI 0.65 â 0.78; p < 0.0001).
Of note, caspofungin, an expensive agent by acquisition
cost, was available solely during the AZ period. When the
cost of caspofungin was removed from the analysis for the
AZ period, the mean increase in total cost and pharmacy
cost decreased to $8,916 and $9,090, respectively. While
the increase in pharmacy costs was substantial between
periods, the increase in mean acquisition cost of antifun-
gals increased by only $947/hospitalization during the AZ
period. In addition to the increased cost associated with
FLU and VOR, a $157,490 increased total cost associated
with greater use of caspofungin was observed during the
AZ period. When this cost of caspofungin was removed
from the analysis, the increased mean antifungal cost of
the AZ period further decreased to $476/hospitalization.
Of note, severe renal dysfunction was associated with a
$20,465 (95% CI $10,458 to $33,729; p < 0.0004)
increased total cost and $5,973 (95% CI $2199 to
$11,400; p = 0.03) increased pharmacy cost per hospital-
ization. Compared to those patients without hepatic tox-
icity, patients with severe hepatic toxicity had an
associated increased total hospital cost of $35,543 (95%
CI $30,409, to $41,499; p < 0.0001) and increased phar-
macy cost of $12,411 (95% CI $10,178 to $15,111; p <
0.0001).
Discussion
The current study was designed to compare patient out-
comes and costs associated with AZ or AMB prophylaxis
in NHO patients. While retrospective in design, the cur-
rent investigation is the largest with respect to the evalua-
tion of VOR for primary prophylaxis in NHO patients.
There are several limitations to the study. As with any ret-
rospective, observational cohort study, the influence of

confounding factors is a concern. An additional challenge
was analyzing those patients who received multiple
courses of antifungals. Using mixed or random effects
logistic regression models that controlled for the number
of hospitalizations and includes fixed effects for each
medication and each period, this bias was statistically
minimized. The subgroup analyses of those patients with
multiple admissions, however, suggest that multiple hos-
pitalizations did not correlate with worse outcomes.
Not surprisingly, the incidence of mild/moderate and
severe renal dysfunction was significantly higher in the
AMB period, consistent with other reports [1,8]. Notably,
renal dysfunction was associated with significantly
increased costs, independent of the study period.
While the nephrotoxic potential of conventional ampho-
tericin is well recognized, the need for hemodialysis was
found to be infrequent.
The rate of severe hepatic toxicity was not significantly dif-
ferent between the AMB and AZ periods. However,
patients treated with VOR had a significantly greater rate
of severe hepatic toxicity. Our findings regarding hepatic
toxicity associated with VOR differ from those reported in
previous prospective, controlled clinical studies; it is pos-
sible that the increased rate may be due to confounding
factors, including concomitant use of hepatotoxic agents
[1-4,7]. Nevertheless, VOR was associated with increased
rate and severity of liver dysfunction.
While not statistically significant, the incidence of proba-
ble and definite breakthrough fungal infections was
greater during the AMB period. However, it is interesting
to note that all breakthrough Candida infections and 4 of
the 5 cases of fatal possible breakthrough Aspergillus
infections occurred in those patients who received FLU
prophylaxis.
The AZ period was associated with an increase of >$9,000/
hospitalization in the mean total and pharmacy costs.
These increases in costs may represent the increased rate

patients treated during the AZ period. More recent
improvement in supportive care medications have
allowed for increased allogeneic and autologous trans-
plantation in an older population of patients compared to
the past. Despite the substantial increase in hospitaliza-

tion costs, the increase in costs directly associated with
antifungal acquisition represented a small percentage of
this increase in cost. Costs included in this study do not
reflect the charges or the actual reimbursement associated
with any of the costs. It should be noted the calculated
cost to reimbursement ratio was similar during the two
time periods (AZ: 1.196 and AMB: 1.153).
Conclusion
While an AZ-based prophylactic regimen is associated
with increased cost, the reduced rate of nephrotoxicity
and availability of oral dosage forms, suggests they be
used preferentially over AMB. While the triazoles may
offer certain advantages, an increased rate of hepatic tox-
icity may be associated with VOR when compared with
AMB or FLU.
