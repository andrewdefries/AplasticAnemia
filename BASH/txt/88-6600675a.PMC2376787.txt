The use of apoptosis-inducing agents in the treatment of malignant cancer is increasingly being considered as a therapeutic approach.
In this study, the induction of apoptosis and necrosis was examined in terms of temporal dose responses, comparing a malignant and
nonmalignant breast cell line. Staurosporine (SSP)-induced apoptosis and H2O2-induced necrosis were evaluated by two cytotoxicity
assays, neutral red (NR) and methyl-thiazolyl tertrazolium (MTT), in comparison with a differential dye uptake assay, using
Hoechst33342/propidium iodide (Hoechst/PI). Confirmatory morphological assessment was also performed by routine resin
histology and transmission electron microscopy. Cell viability was assessed over a 0.5 – 48 h time course. In nonmalignant HBL-100
cells, 50 nM SSP induced 100% apoptosis after a 48 h exposure, while the same exposure to SSP caused only 4% apoptosis in
metastatic T47D cells. Although complete apoptosis of both cell lines was induced by 50 mM SSP, this effect was delayed in T47D
(24 h) compared with HBL-100 (4 h). Results also showed that neither MTT or NR can distinguish between the modes of cell death,
nor detect the early onset of apoptosis revealed by Hoechst/PI.

In the normal breast, epithelial cell death by apoptosis occurs
following lactation. This removal of secretory epithelial cells
is necessary to remodel the breast to a quiescent organ of fat
cells (Strange et al, 1992). In breast cancer, this delicate balance
between a removal of cells through apoptosis and a replacement
of cells via proliferation is disrupted (Martin and Green, 1995).
Identifying and counting apoptotic cells in culture can be
difficult to do with accuracy, as each method available has
advantages and disadvantages. A combination of these methods
can give a more accurate picture of the apoptotic processes
occurring in the cultured cell population.
For these reasons, we examined a combination of metabolic
impairment, mitochondrial function and differential dye
uptake assays, to compare the induction of apoptosis vs necrosis,
by staurosporine (SSP) and H2O2, respectively. SSP, a potent
protein kinase inhibitor with a broad spectrum of activity
(Tamaoki et al, 1986; Kiyoto et al, 1987; Nakano et al, 1987),
has been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of human tumour
cell lines (Bertrand et al, 1994). We used SSP to induce apoptosis
in the nonmalignant human breast HBL-100 cell line (derived
from a lactating breast and transformed by SV40 viral genome,
Gaffney, 1984), and the T47D malignant breast cell line (derived
from metastatic breast cancer, Keydar et al, 1979). The HBL-100
cell line is oestrogen receptor negative, and expresses relatively
high levels of phospholipid/calcium-dependent protein kinase C
(Bargou et al, 1995). The T47D cell line is oestrogen receptor
positive and it also constitutively expresses protein kinase C
isoforms (Nieves-Neira and Pommier, 1999). T47D Cells express
transcripts for the apoptosis-promoting Bax gene but
Bcl-2 transcripts are undetectable (Nieves-Neira and Pommier,
1999) or are present in low amounts; HBL-100 cells, on the
other hand, display expression of both genes (Bargou et al,
1995). The T47D cells have point mutations in the core
DNA-binding region of p53 (Nieves-Neira and Pommier, 1999),
whereas HBL-100 cells exhibit wild-type p53 (Brodowicz et al,
2001).
The reactive oxygen species (ROS), H2O2, is produced during
normal metabolism and also by phagocytic cells at the sites of
inflammation (Hyslop et al, 1995). High levels of ROS can cause
necrosis, while lower levels can cause apoptosis (Lennon et al,
1991; Dypbukt et al, 1994).
The neutral red (NR) metabolic impairment assay works
simply on the principle that this dye accumulates in the lysosomes
of viable cells by a combination of active endocytosis and
pinocytosis until a stable equilibrium is reached. Dead
cells lose their ability to accumulate and retain NR (Borenfreund
and Puerner, 1985). However, this loss does not occur until late in
the apoptotic process, when membrane integrity is compromised.
Furthermore, this dye cannot distinguish between apoptotic or
necrotic death (McCarthy and Evans, 1998).
The methyl-thiazolyl tertrazolium (MTT) assay measures
the mitochondrial function activity of mitochondrial dehydro-
genases (Twentyman and Luscombe, 1987). MTT is a yellow-
coloured tetrazolium salt that is reduced to a purple formazan
at the expense of the reduction reaction products with concomitant
oxidation of NADH and NADPH (Altman, 1976). MTT does
not distinguish between apoptosis and necrosis, nor does it
take account of possible increases in cell number in a cycling
cell population. So, in effect, cell populations may remain constant

or even increase as the cell cycle progresses (McCarthy and Evans,
1998).
The DNA-binding dyes Hoechst 33342 and propidium
iodide were first used together in a differential dye uptake
assay (Hoechst/PI) on the fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS)
(Sun et al, 1992). We have adapted the Hoechst/PI assay in
microtitre plate format for microscopic identification
and quantification of membrane integrity and nuclear morphol-
ogy. Hoechst/PI works on the principle that Hoechst dye is
rapidly incorporated into the nuclei of both apoptotic and necrotic
cells where membrane integrity is compromised, while in live
cells its incorporation into the nuclei occurs at a very slow
rate. The nucleic acid dye PI, on the other hand, is excluded
from both live and apoptotic cells and is incorporated into necrotic
and secondary necrotic cells where membrane integrity is lost. PI
causes the nuclei to stain bright orange/red (Nakajima
et al, 1996). This loss of membrane integrity occurs very late
in the apoptotic process but early during necrosis (Darzynkiewicz
and Li, 1996). In viable cells, phosphatidyl serine (PS) is
predominantly found on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.
In apoptotic cells, PS is translocated to the outer leaflet and is
displayed extracellularly. This forms the basis for detection of
apoptosis using the PS-binding protein, annexin V. However,
recent work shows that PS is also translocated in early necrosis
(oncosis) (Lecoeur et al, 2001). Thus, as an indicator of apoptosis,
annexin V labelling index must be interpreted with caution. In the
light of this, we have examined differential dye uptake as an
alternative, microtitre plate-based assay of apoptosis in adherent
cell lines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and experimental treatments
The HBL-100 cell line derived from the lactating breast
(Gaffney, 1984) and the T47D breast carcinoma cell line (Keydar
et al, 1979) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) with 0.11 g lÀ1
sodium pyruvate and pyroxidine
(Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(PAA Laboratories) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Tech-
nologies). Cells were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere
at 371C.
Cells were seeded at a density of 2 Â 104
cells wellÀ1
and
for approximately 16 h before treatments were added. Experi-
mental treatments of 50 mM SSP, 50 nM SSP and 3 mM H2O2
in growth medium were added to both cell lines for a time course
ranging from 0.5 to 48 h. A control of growth medium was also
run in parallel for each time period in both cell lines. After
treatments, the cells were processed in accordance with each
particular assay.
For confirmatory morphological and ultrastructural studies,
semiconfluent cultures of both cell lines were exposed to
treatments of 50 mM SSP or 3 mM H2O2 in growth media for
24 h. After treatment, cells were rinsed in calcium-free saline,
harvested mechanically and then pelleted in 1.5 ml Eppendorf
tubes. The cell pellets were fixed overnight in 3% glutaraldehyde
in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. They were then washed several times
in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, postfixed in 0.1 M osmium tetroxide in
0.1 M cacodylate buffer and dehydrated in a graded series of
ethanol before embedding in epoxy resin. Semithin sections

NR assay
This assay was performed according to the method of Borenfreund
and Puerner (1985) with modifications as detailed: a 0.4%.
NR stock solution was diluted 1 : 80 in growth medium
to a final concentration of 50 mg mlÀ1
. Control medium was
removed from the 96-well microtitre plates and replaced with
200 ml wellÀ1
of NR solution and incubated for 4 h at 371C. The NR
solution was aspirated and wells were rinsed once
with 200 ml wellÀ1
of 4% formaldehyde containing 1% calcium
chloride. Finally, 200 ml wellÀ1
of solubilisation fluid (1 ml of
glacial acetic acid in 100 ml of 50% ethanol) was added and
agitated for 15 min on a microtitre plate shaker. The absorbance
was read at 550 nm and for each treatment six replicate wells were
examined.
MTT assay
This assay was performed according to the modified method of
Twentyman and Luscombe (1987) as detailed: 10 ml wellÀ1
of a
5 mg mlÀ1
stock MTT solution was added to cells in a 96-well
microtitre plate previously seeded at a volume of 100 ml wellÀ1
.
This was incubated for 2 h at 371C until the purple formazan
crystal developed. Finally the MTT-containing medium was
removed and 200 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) was added
to each well. The absorbance was read at 550 nm and for each
treatment six replicate wells were examined.

Hoechst 33342 was added to a microtitre plate well volume of
100 ml, and incubated in the dark for 60 and 15 min respectively. A
100 ml of methanol : acetic acid (3 : 1) fixative was then added
directly to each well. Cells were viewed under a UV microscope
with DAPI filter. Six replicate wells were analysed for each
treatment by quantitative and qualitative examination of four
random fields in each well.
RESULTS
Pilot dose responses were performed using the NR assay to
assess an approximate lethal dose 100% (LD100) of SSP
and H2O2 in both cell lines. From the results, it was concluded
that in both cell lines the approximate LD100 doses for SSP
and H2O2 were 50 mM and 3 mM, respectively (Figure 1). SSP
at 50 nM was chosen for comparison with the 1000-fold higher
SSP dose. The morphological examination of the cells after these
doses confirmed the NR findings. For example, HBL-100 cells
treated with H2O2 at 3 mM were swollen with evidence of
cell membrane disruption. The nuclei appeared pyknotic
and there was considerable cellular debris in the pellets when
compared to the control sections (Figure 2A, B). Treatment with
SSP at 50 mM resulted in cells exhibiting a different overall
morphology: they were shrunken with condensed nuclear material
(Figure 2C), which had fragmented into electron dense bodies
(Figure 2D).
A comparison was made between all assays and treatments
used for the HBL-100 cell line (Figure 3). The results for the
MTT and NR assays for the 50 mM SSP treatment showed that it
was 24 h before that there was a marked increase in cell
death compared with control levels (Figure 3A). The extent of
apoptosis vs necrosis assessed by the Hoechst/PI assay was
compared using the same dose of SSP over the 0.5 – 48 h time
course (Figure 3D). Apoptosis did not gradually increase in the
first 4 h. Instead, at this time point, virtually the whole population
became apoptotic.
The MTT and NR results for the 50 nM SSP treatment revealed
that a marked increase in cell death did not occur until 48 h and
the percentage of cell death was not as high as that observed with
the 1000-fold higher dose of SSP (Figure 3B). The Hoechst/PI
results showed a marked progression of apoptosis from 6 to 48 h
(Figure 3E). With 50 nM SSP the onset of apoptosis appeared to be
a slower process compared with the 1000-fold higher dose, and the
percentage of dead cells was correspondingly lower at the 24 h time
period.
MTT and NR results for the 3 mM H2O2 treatment reveal that a
marked increase in cell death was observed in the NR assay as early
as 4 h, yet it was 24 h before this was observed with MTT
(Figure 3C). Hoechst/PI assay results showed a steady progression
in necrosis over the entire exposure time (Figure 3F), and virtually
no apoptosis was observed.
A population of untreated control cells at the 6 h time course
period was chosen for comparison (Figure 4A) with Hoechst/PI
differential dye uptake images for each treatment used in the HBL-
100 cell line. This time point was found to be representative
of the control cell population at all the time points examined and
was chosen because the time to maximum effect varied in the
treatment groups. The extent of apoptosis after 4 h of the 50 mM
SSP dose was evinced by typical chromatin margination in the cell
nuclei of virtually all cells, as well as a reduction in cell volume
(Figure 4B). After 48 h of exposure to 50 nM SSP, only a small
proportion of the cell population survived (Figure 4C). The
remaining cells showed few features of apoptosis, instead cells
appear to have undergone secondary necrosis. At the 24 h time
period, 3 mM H2O2-treated cells were entirely infiltrated by PI,
consistent with necrosis.
Comparison between all assays and treatments using the
T47D cell line showed that the 50 mM SSP treatment resulted in a
marked increase in cell death (Figure 5A): this was not observed
in either MTT or NR assays until 24 h. Hoechst/PI assay for
the same SSP dose showed a graduated increase in apoptosis up
to 24 h (Figure 5D), at which point maximum apoptosis was
observed.
With the 50 nM SSP treatment, it was 24 h before MTT cell
death was observed and 48 h before this was seen in NR
(Figure 5B). The Hoechst/PI results for this dose of SSP
showed that from 4 h onwards, the cells maintained a uniform
percentage of apoptotic cells, which began to increase further at
48 h (Figure 5E). From 0.5 to 4 h, there was low level of necrosis in
the SSP-treated cells, but this was not significantly higher than the
control cells. There was a steady level of necrosis until the number
of apoptotic cells within the population increased at 48 h.
A marked and steady increase in cell death was seen with
Hoechst/PI throughout the entire time course study using 3 mM
H2O2. However, it was not until 24 h that cell death was observed
by NR (Figure 5C). Apoptosis (as judged by Hoechst/PI) was
virtually absent. However, necrosis appears at a marked level by
4 h and peaked by 6 h (Figure 5F).
Images of Hoechst/PI differential dye uptake for each treat-
ment used in the T47D cell line were compared to untreated
cell population. The 6 h time point was typical (Figure 6A) of
the control populations examined throughout the time course, in
which cells undergoing different phases of mitosis were observed.
Treatment of cells with 50 mM SSP for 24 h (Figure 6B) resulted
in a marked increase in secondary necrosis in the apoptotic
population. After 24 h, 50 nM SSP-treated cells showed a
small percentage of cell death (Figure 6C), but no significant
change was observed in the overall cell population. Some mitotic
figures could still be seen. H2O2 (3 mM) treatment after
24 h showed an entire cell population with no distinct nuclear
staining (Figure 6D): such ‘ghost’ profiles have been reported to
contain single or multiple clumps of rounded, bright and
condensed chromatin within a pale cytoplasm (Edwards and
Tolkovsky, 1994).

DISCUSSION
This study has evaluated the use of cytotoxicity assays in
comparison with a differential dye uptake assay. Previous studies
have used one or both of these cytotoxicity assays and/or the
differential dye uptake assay in combination with other assay
methods (Edwards and Tolkovsky, 1994; Hardwick et al; 1996;
Hughes et al, 1996; Burger et al, 1999; Lizard et al, 1999;
McGuinness et al, 1999; Sumitomo et al, 1999; DeMeester et al,
1997). However, none have used this specific combination of assays
in evaluating apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines. In addition, the
present study has allowed comparison of the induction of apoptosis
between a nonmalignant and metastatic breast cell line.
We showed that the time of onset of apoptosis as judged by
Hoechst/PI does not correlate with any marked cell death detected
with either cytotoxicity assay. At 50 mM SSP, the nonmalignant
HBL-100 cell line exhibits approximately 100% apoptosis at 4 h (as
judged by Hoechst/PI). However, the MTT and NR assays do not
detect cell death until 24 h. In contrast to the HBL-100 line, the
metastatic T47D cells show only 15% apoptosis at 4 h. Although
they become 100% apoptotic at 24 h, MTT and NR show only 50%
cell death at that time point. At this 50 mM SSP dose, it was observed
in both cell lines that a reduction in MTT correlated with end-stage
apoptosis (secondary necrosis) as detected by Hoechst/PI. The
onset of apoptosis as measured by Hoechst/PI was not reflected by
NR either. This was perhaps not surprising, as NR indicates when
membrane integrity is lost, late in the apoptotic process.
When the HBL-100 cell line was treated with 50 nM SSP, it
yielded similar results to that for 50 mM SSP, again marked changes
in MTT and NR reflected end-stage apoptosis (as judged by
Hoechst/PI). The T47D cell line yielded different results for the
50 nM SSP dose, as an initial reduction in MTT at 4 h correlated
with the observation of apoptosis as detected by Hoechst/PI
coincidentally. However, this appeared to vary over the time
course and no marked increase in initial apoptosis levels, detected
by Hoechst/PI), was seen even after 48 h. This can perhaps be

explained by the greater number of mitotic cells observed (data not
shown) and is therefore reflective of the cycling cell population.
This result also highlights the low level of apoptosis induced by the
50 nM SSP dose in the metastatic breast cell line (approximately
4%) as compared with the non-malignant cell line (approximately
100%), even after 48 h of treatment.
The necrotic treatment, 3 mM H2O2, in the HBL-100 cell line
showed that by 4 h there was a decrease in the amount of viable
cells as detected by NR; however, it was 24 h before this was
observed by MTT. Interestingly, the percentage of necrosis
detected by Hoechst/PI increased steadily from as early as 4 h.
The T47D cell line gave a very different result with this
treatment, as MTT showed a steady decrease in the number of
viable cells detected (compared with control levels) from as early
as 0.5 h. It was 24 h before this type of decrease was detected by
NR. The MTT result may be explained by the possibility that the
metastatic cell line contains a subpopulation of cells that are more
resistant to necrotic cell death.
In conclusion, the 50 nM SSP dose showed that the meta-
static cell line is 25 times more resistant to apoptosis than
the nonmalignant cell line. The T47D cells when treated with
50 mM SSP, revealed a delay in reaching approximately
100% apoptosis (by 24 h) as compared with the HBL-100 cells
(by 4 h). Results of the MTT assay in combination with
the appearance of secondary necrosis (as judged by Hoechst/PI)
suggest that complete mitochondrial breakdown (as opposed
to membrane pore transition) occurs only when secondary
necrosis has begun. The 3 mM H2O2 results also suggest that
the T47D cell line is more resistant to necrotic cell death than
the HBL-100 cell line. Comparing these assay methods has
thus allowed for a quantitative assessment of apoptosis in
these breast cell lines. In addition, this combination of
assay methods, with particular emphasis on Hoechst/PI, has
also shown its ability to distinguish between apoptosis and
necrosis in vitro.
In terms of relevance to cancer biology, the results have
significance: they suggest that malignant breast cells are more
resistant than nonmalignant cells to apoptotic induction, although
possible differences in bcl-2 gene expression or other targets of
SSP would also have an influence. Potential therapeutic approaches
using drug-induced cell death (Makin and Dive, 2001) would need
to be of sufficient duration and dose to overcome this resistance.
However, more breast cell lines of both normal and malignant
phenotype would need to be evaluated to confirm the assertion
that malignant breast cells are more resistant to apoptotic
induction.
