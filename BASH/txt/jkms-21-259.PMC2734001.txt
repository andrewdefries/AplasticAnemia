INTRODUCTION
Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a
well-recognized complication of solid organ and hematopoi-
etic stem transplantation (HSCT), which is usually associated
with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). PTLD represents a hetero-
geneous group of abnormal lymphoid proliferation, generally
B cells, which occurs in the clinical setting of T-cell dysfunc-
tion (1-3). The incidence of PTLD after solid organ trans-
plantation (SOT) ranges from 2% in renal transplantation
to 30% in intestinal and multiorgan transplantation. PTLD
has been rare following allogeneic HSCT, but intensive im-
munosuppression, such as T-cell depletion of grafts, or antithy-
mocyte globulin (ATG), to prevent and treat graft-versus-
host disease (GVHD), can markedly increase the risk (1, 3-
5). An underlying immunodeficiency and the use of alterna-
tive donors, such as matched unrelated donors or HLA-mis-
matched family members, are additional risk factors for the
development of PTLD (1, 3, 4). During the past decade, the
use of alternative donors has increased and this has placed
recipients at a high risk for GVHD and consequent intensive
immunosuppression.
As a result of these changes, PTLD has been encountered
more frequently than in the past. We observed the incidence,
as well as the clinical and pathologic features of PTLD among
1,116 patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT at Catholic
HSCT Center in Korea.

Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Posttransplant
Lymphoproliferative Disorders Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic
Stem Cell Transplantation in Korea
Between 1995 and 2003, seven cases of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disor-
der (PTLD) were identified among 1,116 patients who received allogeneic hematopoi-
etic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) at Catholic HSCT Center (overall incidence
0.6%). Five (71.4%) patients had episodes of acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD)
and were treated with steroids. Cervical lymphadenopathy was observed in most
cases (71.4%), but clinical symptoms varied depending on the involved sites. Patho-
logic findings varied: 1 case of plasmacytic hyperplasia, 3 of polymorphic PTLD, 2
of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 1 of large T-cell lymphoma, which proved to be
associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The proportion of EBV-negative PTLD
was 33.3%. Five patients demonstrated a good response to treatment (treatment
response rate 71.4%). The overall mortality was 42.8%, and one death was directly
attributable to PTLD. The incidence of PTLD is expected to increase, based on
the rising use of grafts from alternative donors and recent clinical features of PTLD
manifested by a disseminated and fulminant nature. It is necessary to have a high
level of suspicion when monitoring patients and readily adopt prompt and effective
cellular immunotherapy for PTLD.

alone. In the corticosteroid-resistant cases, ATG was used as
the second-line treatment, or another immunosuppressant,
such as mycophenolate mofetil or tacrolimus, was added.
Acyclovir (800 mg/day) was given orally from day 7 to engraft-
ment and was followed by long-term low dose (200 mg/day)
oral administration for 6 months posttransplant. For cytome-
galovirus (CMV) prophylaxis, high dose acyclovir (10 mg/kg
three times daily) was given intravenously to patients with
matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT, and ganciclovir (5
mg/kg twice daily) was given intravenously to patients with
family mismatched (FMM) HSCT. Seven cases of PTLD were
identified among 1,116 allogeneic HSCT recipients. We
reviewed retrosepctively the medical and pathology records
of these 7 patients. The details of the study population and
cases of PTLD are summarized in Table 1.
Pathology
Biopsy specimens were obtained from lymph nodes in 4
cases, an oropharyngeal mass in 1 case, gastric tissue in 1 case,
and colonic tissue in 1 case. Diagnoses were established through
clinicopathologic correlation using routine histology, immuno-
histochemistry, and detection of EBV by in-situ hybridiza-
tion for Epstein-Barr early RNA (EBER) by the method
described previously in the literature (7).
RESULTS
Seven patients developed PTLD following allogeneic HSCT:
4 MSD, 2 MUD, 1 full haplotype mismatched. The overall
incidence of PTLD was 0.6% (7/1116). None was diagnosed
postmortem. The median age was 37 yr (range, 17-45 yr)
and the male to female ratio was 6:1, which demonstrated a
predilection for males. All the patients, except one who under-
went a full haplotype mismatched HSCT, were matched at
the HLA A, B and DR loci. The underlying hematologic
diseases were: chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in three
patients, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in two, myelodys-
plastic syndrome (MDS) in one, and severe aplastic anemia
(SAA) in one. For the 4 patients who underwent MSD HSCT,
conditioning regimens were: total body irradiation (TBI)
(1,200 cGy fractionated irradiation) plus cyclophosphamide
(60 mg/kg/day for 2 days) in two patients; TBI (1,320 cGy
fractionated irradiation) plus busulfan (3.2 mg/kg/day intra-
venously for 2 days) in one; and procarbazine (6.25 mg/kg
for 6 days) plus cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg for 4 days) plus
ATG (Thymoglobuline, Sangstat, France, 1.25 mg/kg for 3
days) in one patient with SAA. Two patients who underwent
MUD HSCT received a conditioning regimen of TBI (1,200
cGy) plus cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day for 2 days). One
patient who underwent haploidentical HSCT, received TBI
(1,200 cGy), fludarabine (40 mg/BSA/day for 4 days), busul-
fan (3.2 mg/kg/day intravenously for 3 days) and ATG (Thy-
moglobuline, Sangstat, France, 1.25 mg/kg/day for 4 days),
followed by donor-derived T-cell depleted peripheral stem
cells by CliniMACS for 4 consecutive days. GVHD prophy-
laxis consisted of cyclosporin A with a short course of metho-
trexate in five patients, tacrolimus with a short course of
methotrexate in one, and no GVHD prophylaxis was pro-
vided to one patient with haploidentical HSCT. Acute GVHD
occurred in 5 patients: one patient with grade I, two with

with steroids and demonstrated good responses to steroid
therapy alone. EBV serology prior to HSCT was available
and was seropositive in all of the recipients. All recipients
and donors were CMV seropositive. The characteristics and
transplantation details of the 7 patients with PTLD are sum-
marized in Table 2.
According to the WHO classification (8), 3 cases of PTLD
were polymorphic, one was plasmacytic hyperplasia, and 3
were monomorphic, of which two were diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma and one was large T-cell lymphoma. In situ hyb-
ridization for EBER was positive in 4 cases, negative in 2
cases and not performed in one case. The pathologic results
are summarized in Table 3.
Symptoms and signs related to PTLD developed at a medi-
an time of 130 days (range, 83-244) after transplantation.
The most frequently observed clinical finding was cervical
lymphadenopathy (71.4%, 5/7), but clinical symptoms var-
ied depending on the involved sites. Three patients had dis-
seminated disease and four had localized disease. The first

patient with disseminated disease (UPN1534) was admit-
ted to the hospital with fever, chills, sore throat and cervical
lymphadenopathy. He experienced acute grade III GVHD,
which occurred on the 25th posttransplant day and respond-
ed to methylprednisolone pulse therapy. After that, there
wasnochronicGVHDandhewasmaintainedoncyclosporin A
(500 mg/day) and prednisolone (5 mg/day), but he was re-
admitted with high fever, chills, sore throat and cervical lym-
phadenopathy. A tonsillar biopsy confirmed polymorphic
PTLD (lymphoma, polymorphic B-cell type) on the 91st
posttransplant day. PTLD regressed partially after discontinu-
ation of immunosuppressants and administration of high
dose acyclovir. However, MDS relapsed and the patient died
of a pulmonary hemorrhage on the 268th posttransplant day.
The second patient with disseminated disease (UPN1907)
presented with multiple and extensive lymphadenopathy.
He had been treated with methylprednisolone (125 mg/day)
due to acute grade II GVHD and demonstrated a good res-
ponse. He had no chronic GVHD and was treated with cy-
closporin A (300 mg/day) at the time of the diagnosis of PTLD.
PTLD (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) was confirmed by
biopsy of cervical lymph nodes on the 130th posttransplant
day. Treatment consisted of discontinuation of cyclosporin
A, and initiation of high dose acyclovir and donor lympho-
cyte infusions (DLI, cell dose; 1×106
CD3 cells/kg). PTLD
did not regress but was stable after therapy. However, GVHD
was aggravated after DLI and the patient died of pneumonia
during the treatment of GVHD. The third patient (UPN
1985) underwent full haplotype mismatched HSCT with
aggressive T-cell depletion and experienced CMV antigene-
mia just before the development of PTLD. He presented
with generalized lymphadenopathy, diffuse lung infiltrates,
and hepatosplenic involvement. Lymph node biopsy revealed
diffuse large T-cell lymphoma with TCR- positivity and
positive in situ hybridization for EBER. Hepatic GVHD
occurred concurrently with PTLD. He deteriorated so rapidly
that there was no time for treatment with DLI and he died
of progression of PTLD 8 days after the diagnosis. Four pati-
ents had localized disease. The involved sites were the stom-
ach, colon, oropharynx with cervical lymph nodes, and cer-
vical nodes alone. Three patients experienced acute GVHD
(grade I in UPN426 and UPN1268, grade III in UPN1530)
and responded well to steroid therapy, and only one of these
patients (UPN1530) developed chronic GVHD (limited
type) and was treated with tacrolimus (1 g/day) and pred-
nisolone (20 mg/day). Two patients had polymorphic PTLD
and one had plasmacytic hyperplasia, which was an early lesion
with a good prognosis. One patient without acute GVHD
(UPN1420) developed chronic GVHD concurrently with
PTLD (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). Treatment included
discontinuation of immunosuppressants and DLI (cell dose;
5×105
CD3 cells/kg in UPN426, 1×106
CD3 cells/kg in
UPN1268 and UPN1420) with or without high dose acy-
clovir in 3 patients; and one of the patients (UPN1530) with
plasmacytic hyperplasia, had immunosuppressants discon-
tinued and received high dose acyclovir alone. All four patients
with localized disease demonstrated complete responses to
therapy. Four patients are still alive and free of disease.
As described above, the response to treatment was rela-
tively good (overall response rate; 71.4%, 5/7) and patients
who had localized or polymorphic PTLD had better outcomes
than those who did not. The median number of days of fol-
low-up after diagnosis of PTLD was 831 (range, 8-2,750 days).
Three patients died (overall mortality rate; 42.8%), but only
one patient’s death was directly attributable to PTLD (PTLD-
related mortality rate; 14.2%). The clinical features and out-
comes of the patients with PTLD are summarized in Table 4.
DISCUSSION
PTLD is a life threatening disease that encompasses a hetero-
geneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders ranging from
reactive, polyclonal hyperplasia to aggressive non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (1, 3, 4). PTLD is a well-known complication
following solid organ transplantations and its characteristics,
as well as the strategy for management following the diag-
nosis, have been published extensively (3, 9-11). However,
PTLD in the setting of HSCT, has not been reported in Korea.
The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical and
pathologic characteristics and outcomes of PTLD following
allogeneic HSCT.
The incidence of PTLD after allogeneic HSCT has been
reported to be approximately 1% (4, 5, 11). In this study,
the overall incidence of PTLD of 0.6% (7/1116) was slightly
lower than that of previous studies. However, a recent study
reported that the incidence of PTLD following allogeneic
HSCT was as high as 7.4%. In that study, all the patients
with PTLD had acute GVHD and most of them were treat-
ed with ATG, which suggested that the occurrence of PTLD
was strongly associated with the intensity of the immuno-
suppressive treatment (13). In our study, however, it appeared
that PTLD was not as strongly associated with the grade of
GVHD. Acute GVHD was not severe enough to require that
patients undergo profound immunosuppression and patients
responded well to steroid therapy alone. However, it should
be taken into consideration that over 60% of the cases of
PTLD were diagnosed postmortem in the previous studies
in western countries; and by contrast, in this study there were
no patients with confirmed cases of PTLD at autopsy, because
the autopsy rate is very low in Korea. Therefore, it appeared
that the incidence of PTLD and the role of immunosuppres-
sion in the development of PTLD were underestimated in
this study compared to the previous reports (11-13). Fur-
thermore, since transplants from alternative donors, which
are complicated by the development of GVHD and a delay
in immune reconstitution, have been increasing, the incidence
and severity of PTLD is expected to rise in the future.
Lymphoproliferative Disorder Following Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation 263
The majority of monomorphic PTLDs are of B-cell origin.
In the SOT setting, approximately 13% of PTLDs are of T-
cell origin and 20% to 38% of those are EBV positive (3,
14-17). However, in the HSCT setting, T-cell PTLD is very
rare and only 5 cases have been reported; and only one case
of PTLD following autolous HSCT proved to be associated
with EBV (18-20). We observed one case of large T-cell lym-
phoma that proved to be associated with EBV by positive in
situ hybridization for EBER. To our knowledge, this would
be the first report of EBV-positive T-cell PTLD following
allogeneic HSCT. Recently, Chuhjo et al. proposed the pos-
sibility that EBV can simultaneously infect B and T cells
and can induce clonal proliferation of both lymphocytes in
severely immunocompromised patients (21). Taken together,
EBV may play a certain role in the development of T-cell
PTLD after HSCT, although its pathogenesis has not been
established. We think that aggressive immunosuppressive
therapy in combination with T cell depletion caused the
early EBV reactivation and high EBV burden. Due to a high
level viremia, T cells are thought to be incidentally infected
by EBV, which then leads to PTLD (22). T-cell PTLD tends
to develop later than does B-cell PTLD and has a worse out-
come (14-20) as does EBV-negative PTLD (23, 24). In the
present study, however, the clinical features of EBV-negative
PTLD were not different from those of EBV-positive PTLD,
and did not demonstrate either a worse prognosis or a later
onset.
There are various therapeutic modalities for PTLD and
novel approaches for PTLD treatment are being studied. Dif-
ferent strategies have been adopted according to the type of
PTLD and in the case of non-B cell and EBV-negative PTLD,
cytotoxic chemotherapy may be appropriate. However, regard-
less of the modalities of therapy, the clinical response to treat-
ment has been extremely poor, according to previous stud-
ies, which reported that the mortality of PTLD following
HSCT was nearly 90% (1, 7, 11, 12, 25). In this study, the
treatment response rate was 71.4% (5/7) and the mortality
rate 42.8% (3/7). The lower mortality rate and better response
could be explained in part, by the fact that there were no
autopsy cases in the study. However, considering that three
of four patients who received DLI demonstrated a complete
response, the early detection of PTLD in patients and prompt
management with DLI seemed to improve the response to
therapy and decrease the mortality rate. DLI is an effective
form of immunotherapy provided to allogeneic HSCT recip-
ients. However, DLI can produce significant consequences,
i.e., the development of GVHD (1, 3, 4, 9). One patient in
this study, who received DLI and demonstrated a partial
response, died of pneumonia complicated by extensive GVHD.
Therefore, immunotherapy using donor-derived, cloned,
EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL), which is a more tar-
geted therapy without the risk of GVHD, is expected to be
a promising therapeutic modality (1, 3, 4, 9, 26). For the
early detection of patients who require preemptive interven-
tion, the dual-assay approach using serial monitoring for EBV
load and EBV-specific CTL response, could be helpful in the
future (9, 27, 28).
In summary, although the incidence of PTLD following
HSCT is low, PTLD is expected to increase because of the
increasing use of grafts from alternative donors and the inten-
sity of immunosuppression. Early detection and prompt ther-
apy is considered to be as important as the immune status of
the patients.
