Human cyclic neutropenia is a rare disease of unknown etiology characterized
by periodic oscillations of the blood neutrophil count. Onset of illness usually
begins in childhood, although in ^-25% of patients the first symptoms occur after
age 20 (1, 2). These distinctly different modes of onset suggest heterogeneity in
the pathophysiology of cyclic neutropenia. Recently we determined (3) that
adult-onset cyclic neutropenia could be distinguished morphologically from the
childhood-onset form of the disease by the presence of increased numbers of
circulating large granular lymphocytes (LGL).
In this report we investigated the possibility that cyclic neutropenia could be
associated with a clonal proliferation of lymphocytes. We assessed clonality by
analyzing genomic DNA for evidence of rearrangement of the T cell receptor a
chain gene. Our results show that adult-onset cyclic neutropenic patients with
increased LGL had clonal populations of lymphocytes, whereas those patients
with childhood-onset cyclic neutropenia had no evidence for clonal rearrange-
ment of the To gene.
Materials and Methods
Patients. Clinical details concerning patients 1-5 have been published previously (3).
Patients 1-3 had adult-onset disease; patients 4 and 5 had childhood-onset cyclic neutro-
penia. The diagnosis of cyclic neutropenia was established by performing blood counts a
minimum of three times per week for at least 6 wk, as previously described (1-4). Cycle
lengths of patients 1, 3, 4, and 5 were within the 19-22-d cycle period seen in 85% of
patients with cyclic neutropenia (1), whereas the cycle length in patient 2 wasa bit longer
at 27 d.
Patients 1-3 with adult-onset cyclic neutropenia had markedly increased LGL counts
at time of diagnosis, ranging from 2,170-6,143/mms (normals in our laboratory: 223 ±
99, n = 10), whereas the two patients with childhood-onset disease had normal LGL
counts (3). At the time of this study, patients 2 and 3 were in clinical remission from
neutrophil cycling on alternate-day steroid therapy. Such therapy resulted in reduction
of numbersof LGL, although LGLcounts remained greater than normal (3).

Blot Hybridization Analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from PBMC as previously
described (5). 75-90% of these PBMC were LGL in the patients with adult-onset cyclic
neutropenia. The DNA samples were then digested with restriction enzymes Bam HI,
Eco RI, or Hind III . Digested DNA was separated on 1 .1 % agarose gels and transferred
onto nitrocellulose filter by the method of Southern (6). Filters were then hybridized to
DNA probes that had been "P-labeled by nick translation and visualized by autoradiog-
raphy as previously described (5). The cDNA clone Jurkat B2 containing the C and J
regions of the To gene (7) was kindly provided by Dr. Tak Mak (Ontario Cancer Institute,
Toronto, Canada). A fragment representing nucleotides 100-870 (7) was isolated on
agarose gels and used as the hybridization probe .
Results
The human To gene locus has two constant region genes designated C,31 and
CF2 (8). Digestion of non-T cell DNA with restriction enzyme Bam HI produces
a 23-kb germline fragment containing both constant region genes. Therefore,
rearrangements at either Ca gene locus may be detected after digestion with this
enzyme by the appearance of a smaller Bam HI fragment containing the Ca gene .
Eco RI cleaves within the Ta gene locus and produces two germline fragments
of 11 and 4 kb, containing CFI and CF2, respectively. Since the CF2 rearrange-
ments are not detected by constant region probe when DNA is digested with this
enzyme (9), any nongermline band observed represents rearrangement of the
CFI gene. Digestion of non-T cell DNA with restriction enzyme Hind III
produces two germline CF2 containing fragments of 8 and 6.5 kb, and one 3 .5-
kb fragment containing the CF1 gene. These patterns of somatic rearrangement
of T cell receptor gene can be detected in clonal populations of T cells, and
therefore can be used to demonstrate clonality of various T cell malignancies
(10, 11).
Results of Southern blot hybridization analyses using the TF gene probe are
shown in Fig. 1 . Analysis of DNA after digestion with Barn HI or Eco RI showed
clonal rearrangement of TF gene in patients 1-3. In contrast, we saw a germline
pattern in DNA from patients 4 and 5 after digestion with these enzymes. Hind
III digestions showed germline pattern in all five patients (data not shown). As
indicated by Eco RI analysis, rearrangement in patients 1 and 3 involved the CFI
gene . In patient 2, it was not possible to determine by Eco RI or Hind III
digestion whether the rearrangement indicated by Bam HI analysis involved the
CFI or CF2 gene. The intensity of signal of the rearranged bands indicates that
the vast majority of PBMC were clonal . Therefore, it is not possible that T cells
with a non-LGL morphology represented the clonal proliferation, since they
were only a minor population of the PBMC .
Discussion
These results show that all three patients with adult-onset cyclic neutropenia
had a clonal proliferation of LGL, as indicated by somatic rearrangement of the
TF gene. In contrast, both patients with childhood-onset cyclic neutropenia had
no evidence for a clonal lymphocyte proliferation . These data suggest that adult-
onset cyclic neutropenia can be distinguished from the childhood-onset form of
the disease by the presence of a clonal proliferation of LGL.
Having shown clonality in these patients with acquired cyclic neutropenia, the

question remains whether this disease is actually malignant. The clinical course
of these patients has been remarkably stable, with cyclical illnesses having
occurred over 8-14 yr of duration. These patients with adult-onset cyclic
neutropenia share several features of patients with LGL leukemia, who also have
a clonal proliferation of LGL (12-15). Both groups have excess LGL that express
some NK cell surface antigens. These LGL have little NK cell activity in vitro
(3, 13); however, cytotoxicity can be induced by treatment with anti-CD3 mAb
or IL-2 (16). Furthermore, lymphocytic infiltration of splenic red pulp cords and
bone marrow has been documented in both groups (3, 13). Most patients with
LGL leukemia also have a chronic clinical course, with morbidity and mortality
generally resulting from infections acquired during severe neutropenia rather
than from tissue infiltration by abnormal lymphocytes (17). Thus it would appear
that in most instances an abnormal clone remains under partial immunoregula-
tory control, as occurs, for example, in benign monoclonal gammopathy.
The etiology of cyclic neutropenia is not certain, although marrow transplan-
tation studies have shown that the defect originates at the stem cell level in both
dogs and man (18-21). In both childhood-onset and adult-onset disease in man,
a final common pathway for the neutropenia, namely a periodic failure of
production, has been demonstrated by kinetic studies (1, 22). Furthermore,
mathematical models have stressed that stable oscillations almost certainly result
from an abnormality in feedback regulation of hematopoiesis (23-27). Although
several investigators (28-32) have attempted to document a causative role for
specific feedback abnormalities in patients with this disease, considerable differ-
ences in interpretation of the data exist and no consensus for the mechanism has
come forth. The data we report here strongly implicate a role for a population
of LGL in the etiology of cyclic hematopoiesis. LGL have been reported to
2092 LOUGHRAN AND HAMMOND BRIEF DEFINITIVE REPORT
produce multiple regulatory factors including colony-stimulating factor (33, 34),
as well as cause inhibition ofgranulocyte/macrophage colony formation (35-37).
The clonal expansion of LGL could also conceivably decrease the number or
function of cells (such as other lymphocytes or monocytes) crucial to the regula-
tory feedback loop. The demonstration of a clonal expansion of LGL in this
subset of patients with cyclic hematopoiesis provides an opportunity to examine
one component of the homeostatic control mechanisms for granulopoiesis.
Summary
Human cyclic neutropenia occurs in children and adults. Adult-onset cyclic
neutropenia is an acquired disease characterized by increased numbers of large
granular lymphocytes (LGL), in contrast to childhood-onset cyclic neutropenia
in which LGL counts are normal. We investigated the clonality of lymphocytes
in these two groups of patients by assessing the rearrangement status of the T
cell receptor ,B chain gene. Patients with adult-onset cyclic neutropenia showed
clonal rearrangement of the Ts gene whereas the children did not . Since LGL
are known to have multiple regulatory effects on normal hematopoiesis, the
finding of a clonal proliferation of this lymphocyte population implicates these
cells in the pathogenesis of cyclic neutropenia.
We thank Dr. Paul Neiman for helpful discussions.
