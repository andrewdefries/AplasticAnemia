INTRODUCTION
Immunosuppressive agents are the major therapy in focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and in aplastic anemia,
and therefore it generally believed that immunological mech-
anisms contribute to both diseases. The pathogenesis of FSGS
is unknown but appears to be the result of a lymphokine or
cytokine, which leads to glomerular epithelial cell injury re-
sulting in segmental scar formation and finally glomerular
destruction (1, 2). Aplastic anemia is manifested as a reduction
in the number of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells, but,
why this occurs is still uncertain. Some of the causes include
abnormalities of the hematopoietic stem cells, abnormalities
in the hematopoietic microenvironment, and immunologically
mediated damage to the hematopoietic stem cells (3, 4). Al-
though immune pathophysiology might influence on each
disease mechanism, a MEDLINE review of the literature
notices there is no previous description involving FSGS with
aplastic anemia. Here, we report a case of FSGS associated with
aplastic anemia, and summarize the literature in this setting.
CASE REPORT
A 30-yr-old woman was admitted to this hospital with
symptoms of general weakness and generalized edema last-
ing for 3 weeks. She had no previous history of drug, chem-
ical exposure, radiation, or infection. The physical findings
included pale conjunctiva, marked pretibial edema, and a
blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. A peripheral blood count
showed hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL, hematocrit 20.7%, corrected
reticulocyte count 0.8%, white blood count of 4,200/ L (39%
polymorphonuclear cells, 45% lymphocytes, 12% monocytes),
and platelet count 70,900/ L. In blood smear, normochromic,
normocytic anemia without polychromatophilia was found,
no schistocytes were present, and white cells and platelets
were decreased without abnormal cells. The direct Coombs
test was negative. Proteinuria (2+, 3.6 g/day) and microscopic
hematuria were detected by urinalysis. Blood urea nitrogen
(BUN) was 25 mg/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, serum choles-
terol 292 mg/dL and serum protein 7.0 g/dL with albumin
3.2 g/dL. Serum electrolytes and serum IgG, IgM, and IgA
were unremarkable. A renal ultrasound found normal sized
and echogenic kidneys in each. A percutaneous renal needle
biopsy was taken four days after admission. Twenty-two glo-
meruli were present in the specimen for light microscopy.
Kidney biopsy revealed obliteration of the glomerular capil-
lary lumen in segmental parts of some of the glomeruli (12%),
establishing the diagnosis of FSGS (Fig. 1). Tubules exhib-
ited focal moderate to severe atrophy or loss with interstitial
fibrosis and mononuclear cell infiltration. Blood vessels were
unremarkable. The immunofluorescence revealed segmental

A Case of Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis Associated with
Aplastic Anemia
The pathogenic mechanism of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and
aplastic anemia are associated with immunologic events which lead to glomerular
cell injury or hematopoietic cell destruction. We present an extremely rare case of
FSGS with aplastic anemia in a 30-yr-old woman. The laboratory examination show-
ed hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL, white blood count of 4,200/ L, platelet count 70,900/ L.
Proteinuria (2+, 3.6 g/day) and microscopic hematuria were detected in urinalysis.
The diagnosis of FSGS and aplastic anemia were confirmed by renal and bone
marrow biopsy. She was treated with immunosuppressive therapy of prednisone
60 mg/day orally for 8 weeks and cyclosporine A 15 mg/kg/day orally. She responded
with gradually improving her clinical manifestation and increasing peripheral blood
cell counts. Prednisone was maintained at the adequate doses with tapering after
8 weeks and cyclosporine was given to achieve trough serum levels of 100-200 ng/
mL. At review ten month after diagnosis and initial therapy, the patient was feeling
well and her blood cell counts increased to near normal (Hb 9.5 g/dL, Hct 32%, WBC
8,300/ L, platelet 123,000/ L) and renal function maintains stable with normal range
proteinuria (0.25 g/day).

IgM deposits in one of the visualized glomeruli. Electron mi-
croscopy showed marked foot process fusions of the podocytes
in a microscopically normal glomerulus. Simultaneously, we
performed a bone marrow (BM) biopsy for pancytopenia study.
Biopsy confirmed severe hypocellular BM (10%), with in-
creased fatty areas and a few hematopoietic cells with normal
appearance, and negative cytogenetic studies (Fig. 2). Finally,
we diagnosed FSGS associated with mild aplastic anemia. In
addition, we excluded any other secondary causes of FSGS
and aplastic anemia. No clinical or serological evidence for
parvovirus B19, Ebstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hep-
atitis B or C infection and human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) was obtained. Other immunological tests showed C3
112 mg/dL (normal 62-99 mg/dL), C4 32.5 mg/dL (normal
19-36 mg/dL) and antinuclear antibody or RA factor within
the normal range. Furthermore, there was no radiological evi-
dence for reflux nephropathy or renal agenesis.
She was treated with immunosuppressive therapy of pred-
nisone 60 mg/day orally for 8 weeks and oral cyclosporine
15 mg/kg/day. Additionally, supportive therapy including
ACE inhibitor and protein restriction (<0.8 g/kg/day) were
given. After 2 months, she responded with gradually improv-
ing her clinical manifestation and increasing peripheral blood
cell counts. Prednisone was maintained at the adequate doses
with tapering after 8 weeks but cyclosporine was given suffi-
cient to achieve trough serum levels of 100-200 ng/mL. No
cyclosporine-associated toxicity occurred. At review ten month
after diagnosis and initial therapy, the patient was feeling well
and her blood cell counts increased to near normal (Hb 9.5
g/dL, Hct 32%, WBC 8,300/ L, platelet 123,000/ L) and
renal function maintained stable (BUN 22 mg/dL, creatinine
1.0 mg/dL) with normal range proteinuria (0.25 g/ day).
DISCUSSION
FSGS is a clinicopathological disease defined by the presence
of proteinuria and by segmental glomerular scars involving
some glomeruli. Primary FSGS accounts for 7-20% of glo-
merular lesions in patients presenting with nephrotic syn-
drome (5, 6). Since the pathogenesis and treatment for pri-
mary and secondary FSGS may differ significantly, secondary
causes associated with FSGS such as infection with HIV, heroin
abuse and reflux nephropathy must be excluded before mak-
ing the diagnosis of primary FSGS (2).
Aplastic anemia is manifested as a marked reduction in
the number of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells, but why
this occurs is still uncertain. Some of the proposed pathogenic
mechanisms include intrinsic defects of hematopoietic stem
cells, defects in the marrow microenvironment, and abnormal
humoral or cellular immune control of hematopoiesis (3, 4,
7). Aplastic anemia is occasionally associated with renal dis-
eases such as, chronic renal failure, chronic glomerulonephri-
tis or nephrotic syndrome. Glomerular involvement is mainly
caused by parvovirus B19 with or without renal allograft,
organic solvent exposure or autoimmune diseases (8, 9). In
particular, in aplastic anemia combined with an autoimmune
disease, some reports showed that eosinophilic fasciitis, glome-
rulonephritis, thymoma or systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE) were associated with aplastic anemia (10).
Though the association between glomerulonephritis and
aplastic anemia has yet not been well established, immuno-
suppressive agents are often effective in treating FSGS and
aplastic anemia. Thus, it is now believed that immunologi-
cal mechanisms contribute to the disease, with active destruc-
tion of blood-forming cells by lymphocytes. Cases have been
reported in which cytotoxic T cell clones that damage the
autologous hematopoietic precursor cells are present and some
have suggested that T cell dysfunction may play a role in the
pathogenesis of the glomerular lesion (11). Other proposed
mechanisms include the production of circulatory ‘perme-
ability’ factor (s), possibly cytokines or lymphokine (IFN- ,
TNF) or related substances that could suppress hematopoi-
etic cell proliferation and increase glomerular membrane per-

meability, resulting in epithelial cell injury, segmental scar
formation and ultimately glomerular obsolescence. The aber-
rant immune response may be triggered by environmental
exposure to chemicals, drugs or viral infections, and perhaps,
to endogenous antigens generated by genetically altered BM
cells (2, 12).
In the case described here, the clinical and pathological
features led to a diagnosis of FSGS coexistent with aplastic
anemia. In this case of both FSGS and aplastic anemia, each
disorder is occasionally associated with autoimmune disease,
such as SLE or rheumatoid arthritis (10). Also, although a
renal biopsy was not performed, a case was reported by Park
et al. that aplastic anemia and nephrotic syndrome was simul-
taneously diagnosed in SLE (13). In our opinion, this case is
suggested that direct immune mechanism, i.e., involving
cytotoxic T cells and cytokines, influences both diseases and
there was no trigger factor, such as drug and chemical expo-
sure or viral infection.
The treatment of FSGS and aplastic anemia are controver-
sial issues, mostly immunosuppressive therapies and conser-
vative treatments have been used (3, 8, 14). Response to im-
munosuppressive therapy would suggest a causative or per-
petuating role for autoimmunity in the development of these
diseases. In aplastic anemia, treatment with immune suppres-
sion (cyclosporine A±anti-lymphocyte globulin) and BM
transplantation has improved the response rates and survival
of patients (3, 8). In fact, various immunosuppressive agents
such as corticosteroid, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, or
cyclosporine A have been used in the treatment of FSGS. How-
ever, among them, only cyclosporine A is an effective immuno-
suppressive drug in aplastic anemia. So, in our case, we decid-
ed to use high-dose corticosteroids and cyclosporine A and
added ACE inhibitors combined with diet therapy for anti-
proteinuric effect. At the present time, she is in the ten month
of follow-up and her blood cell count increases near to normal
and serum creatinine remains stable with near normal pro-
teinuria.
In summary, we describe a rare report showing an associa-
tion between FSGS and aplastic anemia. Our observations
suggest that immune mechanism including T lymphocytes
and cytokines could play a role in the development of FSGS
and aplastic anemia.
