Abstract
Background: The use of antilymphocyte agents has improved patient and graft survival in
hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplantation but has been associated with the
development of short-term toxicities as well as long-term complications.
Case presentation: We report a young female with Fanconi anemia who received antithymocyte
globulin as part of the conditioning regimen prior to her planned allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplant at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh. She developed sudden
and severe hepatotoxicity after receiving the first dose of horse antithymocyte globulin, manifested
by marked elevation of serum transaminases and mild elevation of serum bilirubin level.
Immediately after withdrawal of the offending agent and shifting to the rabbit form of antithymocyte
globulin, the gross liver dysfunction started to subside and the hepatic profile results returned to
the pre-transplant levels few weeks later. The patient had her allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplant as planned without any further hepatic complications. After having a successful allograft,
she was discharged from the stem cell transplant unit. During her follow up at the outpatient clinic,
the patient remained very well and no major complication was encountered.
Conclusion: Hepatotoxicity related to the utilization of antithymocyte globulin varies
considerably in severity and may be transient or long standing. There may be individual or
population based susceptibilities to the development of side effects and these adverse reactions
may also vary with the choice of the agent used. Encountering adverse effects with one type of
antithymocyte agents should not discourage clinicians from shifting to another type in situations
where continuation of the drug is vital.
Background
Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) has been used effectively
and safely in the treatment of aplastic anemia, in the con-
ditioning regimens of hematopoietic stem cell transplant
(HSCT), in the treatment of acute graft versus host disease

(GVHD) and in the prevention and treatment of acute
rejection in solid organ transplantation [1-5].
Rabbit ATG is a purified polyclonal immunoglobulin G
(IgG) prepared from the plasma of healthy rabbits hyper-
immunized with a human T cell line [4,6]. The high spe-
cific activity and antibody content imply the need for
lower doses with reduced side effects in comparison to the
other antilymphocyte agents [4]. Like all other immuno-
suppressive agents, ATG has several adverse effects that
include variable degrees of hepatotoxicity [2-4].
Recent advances in immunosuppressive therapy have
resulted in significantly improved patient and graft sur-
vival after solid organ transplantation [7]. However, the
increased utilization of immunosuppressive agents has
brought special attention to specific toxicities associated
with the use of these drugs [7]. As new agents are devel-
oped with narrow therapeutic windows, it will be essen-
tial to identify specific drug toxicities and to develop
preventive and management therapeutic strategies [7].
Case presentation
A 23 years old Saudi female, with no previous medical ill-
nesses, was diagnosed to have Fanconi anemia (FA) at
ARAMCO hospital in Dhahran in May 2002. Since then
she became blood transfusion dependent, requiring 2
units of packed red blood cells every 6 to 8 weeks. How-
ever, the patient never received androgen therapy. After
finding a healthy and an HLA identical sibling donor, the
patient was transferred to King Faisal Specialist Hospital
and Research Centre (KFSH&RC) in Riyadh for allogeneic
HSCT. On 16/5/2005, she was admitted to the HSCT unit.
She was totally asymptomatic and her physical examina-
tion revealed: pallor and pigmentation of the buccal
mucosa but no jaundice, cyanosis, leg oedema or external
lymphadenopathy. Her chest was clear, there were no
murmurs or added heart sounds, no abdominal tender-
ness or palpable organomegaly and no neurological defi-
cit. Blood counts were as follows: WBC: 1.83 × 109/L, Hb:
83 g/L, PLT: 52 × 109/L. Bone marrow examination
showed a hypocellular marrow without any abnormal cell
collection and a normal cytogenetic analysis. The renal
and the coagulation profiles were within normal limits.
The liver function tests were normal apart from a slight
elevation of the serum level of alanine transaminase
(ALT):78 U/L. The serum ferritin level was 850.8 μgram/
litre [normal range: 13–150 μg/L]. Hepatitis serology and
viral screens were negative. Ultrasound of the abdomen
showed no focal liver abnormality. Chest radiograph,
electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were all within
normal limits.
On day-6 HSCT, the patient was commenced on a pediat-
ric conditioning protocol composed of: horse ATG 40 mg/
m2 IV over 10 hours on days: -6, -4 and -2 HSCT and 20
mg/m2 IV over 10 hours on days: +2, +4, +6, +8, +10 and
+12 HSCT in addition to cyclophosphamide: 5 mg/Kg IV
over 30 minutes on days: -5, -4, -3 and -2 HSCT. The
patient was also given cyclosporin-A: 2.5 mg/kg IV twice
daily as GVHD prophylaxis as well as infection prophy-
laxis in the form of acyclovir, trimethoprim-sulphameth-
oxazole and fluconazole. The patient received ATG
premedications and she encountered no immediate reac-
tions to the first dose of horse ATG. On day-5 HSCT, the
patient was totally asymptomatic and her physical exami-
nation revealed no new abnormality but her liver function
tests became severely disturbed: total bilirubin: 37 μmole/
litre [normal range: 0–22 μmole/L], ALT: 604 unit/litre
[normal range: 0–50 U/L], aspartate transaminase (AST):
708 U/L [normal range: 0–40 U/L] and lactic dehydroge-
nase (LDH): 1424 U/L [normal range: 70–250 U/L] (Fig-
ure 1). The horse ATG treatment was stopped, the planned
dose of cyclophosphamide was held and fluconazole
prophylaxis was discontinued temporarily to prevent fur-
ther deterioration in the hepatic profiles. On day-4 HSCT,
the patient remained clinicially stable and her elevated
serum bilirubin and liver enzymes decreased by approxi-
mately 50%. The horse type of ATG was replaced by the
rabbit form of ATG: 10 mg/m2 IV over 10 hours on days: -
4, -3 and -2 HSCT and 7 mg/m2 IV over 10 hours on days:
+2, +4, +6, +8, +10 and +12 HSCT. On day -3 HSCT, the
patient remained clinically stable and her hepatic profiles
improved further. Thereafter, the patient had progressive
improvement in her liver function tests despite the contin-
uation of rabbit ATG therapy (Figure 1). On day-1 HSCT,
she received the dose of cyclophosphamide which was
due 4 days earlier. One day later, the patient received her
allograft without any complications and she was resumed
on fluconazole prophylaxis. In the early post-transplant
period, the patient developed grade II mucositis treated
with PCA (patient controlled analgesia) tramadol and
antiseptic mouth care in addition to aspiration pneumo-
nia requiring artificial ventilation for 48 hours. No viral
infections, acute GVHD or veno-occlusive disease of the
liver were encountered during this hospitalization. The
patient engrafted her leucocytes on day +25 and her plate-
lets on day +16 HSCT. After the recovery of her blood
counts and the discontinuation of the intravenous medi-
cations, the patient was discharged on day +28 HSCT on
infection prophylaxis including trimethoprim-sulphame-
thoxazole and acyclovir till day +30 HSCT as well as
cyclosporin-A 100 mg orally twice daily. Thereafter the
patient had regular follow up at the HSCT outpatient
clinic. Subsequently, she developed chronic GVHD of the
liver which was treated with cyclosporin-A, prednisone
and mycophenolate mofetil for a total duration of 8
months. The chimerism studies done on days +100 and
+365 HSCT showed evidence of a successful engrafment
as both the lymphoid and the myeloid cells were 100%

donor type. The patient was last seen at the outpatient
clinic on 01/10/2006. She was totally asymptomatic and
her physical examination revealed no abnormality. Her
blood indices were as follows: WBC: 10.6 × 109/L, Hb:
122 g/L, PLT: 244 × 109/L. Her renal and coagulation pro-
files were normal. The liver function tests were all within
normal limits (Figure 1). The patient was given no new
medication and she was given a new appointment for fol-
low up.
Discussion
Fanconi anemia is a genetic disorder associated with
diverse congenital abnormalities, progressive bone mar-
row failure and an increased risk of leukemia and other
cancers [8]. Allogeneic HSCT has been found to be an
effective therapy for FA patients having a matched sibling
donor [8-12]. Various pre-transplant conditioning proto-
cols have been employed including the following in vari-
ous combinations: low dose cyclophosphamide, ATG,
radiotherapy (total body irradiation or limited field radi-
otherapy), fludarabine and busulphan [8-12].
Cyclosporin-A, methotrexate, daclizumab and even ATG
have also been used in the GVHD prophylaxis [8-12].
Increased survival in FA patients undergoing allogeneic
HSCT is associated with: younger age of the allograft
recipients, having higher platelet counts in the pre-trans-
plant period, the use of low dose cyclophosphamide and
limited field radiotherapy in the pre-transplant condition-
ing protocols and the use of cyclosporin-A in the GVHD
prophylaxis [8,9,11].
ATG is composed of immunoglobulin G (IgG) fraction of
sera from rabbits or horses immunized with human thy-
mocytes or T-cell lines [1]. ATG is a useful alternative to
HSCT in selected patients with aplastic anemia [13]. It has
the following advantages in comparison to HSCT: the
costs are lower, the need for HLA-identical HSCT donors
is abolished, the non-existence of GVHD and the possibil-
ity of treating patients more than 30 years old even those
pre-treated with blood transfusions [13]. Being a product
of heterogenous sera, ATG recipients who demonstrate
hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis can be
skin tested prior to ATG administration to aid in deter-
mining the hypersensitivity reactions to ATG [14].

Patients who demonstrate hypersensitivity to ATG should
not receive this drug unless it is deemed essential and
unless the benefits are judged to overweigh the risks.
Under such circumstances, these patients may become
candidates for ATG desensitization [14].
The adverse effects associated with the use of polyclonal
antilymphocyte agents are variable in severity and they
include: fever, chills, myalgias, artheralgias, various cuta-
neous eruptions, serum sickness, gastrointestinal com-
plaints including vomiting and diarrhea,
lymphadenopathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, syn-
cope, generalized seizures, disseminated intravascular
coagulation, renal dysfunction and hepatotoxicity
[6,7,13,15-18]. The adverse effects occur in response to
the administration of foreign protein substances but can
be prevented by pre-treatment with corticosteroids,
diphenhydramine and acetaminophen [7]. Although the
adverse effects and the allergic complications associated
with the use of ATG may cause substantial morbidity,
most of them are usually reversible within few days [6]. To
reduce the frequency and the severity of these side effects
and complications, it is recommended to: use long intra-
venous infusion durations over 12 to 18 hours, change the
ATG type in subsequent courses of therapy and increase
the time interval between repeated cycles of treatment
[6,17,19]. Unfortunately antilymphocyte globulin (ALG)
and/or ATG may cause prolonged immunodeficiency thus
making infectious complications more frequent suggest-
ing the importance of aggressive monitoring of viral and
fungal infections [5]. Particular attention should be
devoted to the potential of infections with herpes viruses,
especially cytomegalovirus, following the use of intensive
conditioning regimens particularly those that include
ATG [20]. Therefore, ALG/ATG should be used with cau-
tion and the negative consequences must be understood
and possibly prevented [5]. ATG induction therapy in
immunologically high risk individuals induces a pro-
found long-term decrease in the cell counts and the Th1
but not the Th2 responses to CD4+T cells which may
explain the long-term effects on infection and the devel-
opment of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease
because of the inadequate T-cell control [21]. Serum anti-
rabbit and/or anti-horse antibodies have been demon-
strated in a significant proportion of renal transplant
recipients even before transplantation possibly due to an
environmental exposure [22].
The adverse effects and the long-term toxicity of anti-lym-
phocyte agents may vary with the choice of the agent used.
Examples include: (1) In certain populations: rabbit ATG
has been found to cause more frequent adverse effects
than horse ATG, while in other populations, only mild
allergic reactions were encountered with the use of rabbit
ATG. (2) The anti-human thymocyte globulin form of
rabbit ATG has been found to cause significantly greater
incidence of cytomegalovirus infections, malignancy and
death compared to the anti-human T-lymphocyte immu-
noserum type of rabbit ATG in renal transplant recipients
[4,17,23]. The use of the horse and the rabbit forms of
ATG is associated with variable degrees of hepatotoxicity
including the elevation of serum ALT level which is usu-
ally transient but may persist for about 6 months [2,3,6].
Chronic liver dysfunction is a common complication in
long-term BMT survivors [24]. The etiology is often multi-
factorial with iron overload, chronic hepatitis C infections
and chronic GVHD being the main causes [24].
In the patient presented, no immediate allergic reactions
were encountered. Also no systemic side effects were
observed apart from the isolated and the asymptomatic
hepatotoxicity. Both ALT and AST levels became severely
elevated after the dose of horse ATG given. Despite the
introduction of rabbit ATG, the serum levels of ALT and
AST continued to decrease gradually with time. Even
serum bilirubin level, which increased moderately in
response to the dose of horse ATG given, continued to
decrease progressively after the stopping this drug and
replacing it with rabbit ATG therapy. Follow up of the
patient did not reveal any infectious complications eg
cytomegalovirus infection or post-transplant lymphopro-
liferative disease.
Conclusion
The antilymphocyte agents play a vital immunosuppres-
sive role in hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ trans-
plantation. The hepatotoxicity associated with the use of
ATG varies in severity and in duration. The adverse effects
of antithymocyte agents vary with the type of the agent
used and they may also vary from one population to
another. Therefore, encountering severe side effects and
toxicity with one type of ATG should encourage physi-
cians and pharmacists to shift to another kind of ATG par-
ticularly in situations where continuation of the drug is
essential.
