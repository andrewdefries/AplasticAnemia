The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) estimates that approximately 1.2
billion pounds of pesticides were used in the
United States in 1999 (Donaldson et al.
2002), which was equivalent to 4.4 pounds
per capita in the U.S. population. Of these
pesticides, 76% were used in agriculture, 11%
in other industries/governments, and 13% in
homes and gardens; also, they were used by
77% of U.S. households and 1.2 million certi-
ﬁed professional applicators (Donaldson et al.
2002). Despite a recent decline in overall
usage after a marked increase in the 1950s and
1960s, and despite the fact that registrations
of some pesticides found to have unacceptable
toxicity have been canceled, there has been a
concern about their long-term effects on
human health, because some pesticides persist
in human tissues, soil, foods, and the home
environment (Muller 2000).
One of the major health concerns is car-
cinogenicity. More than 30 pesticides or
groups of pesticides have been identified as
possible carcinogens to humans by several
national and international institutions
[International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) 1987, 1991; U.S. EPA 2004].
Pesticides may increase the risk of cancer
through various mechanisms. Some are known
to be genotoxic (mutagenic) or tumor promo-
tive, whereas others possess hormonal,
immunotoxic, or hematotoxic properties
(Acquavella et al. 2003; Dich et al. 1997).
Furthermore, it has been reported that expo-
sure to certain pesticides synergistically
increases the mutagenicity of diet-derived
heterocyclic amines (Wagner et al. 2003).
Higher frequencies of chromosome aberrations,
sister chromatid exchanges, and micronuclei
have been observed in peripheral lymphocytes
of pesticide applicators and certain groups of
farmers (Bolognesi 2003; Maroni and Fait
1993). Because of these chromosome abnor-
malities, cancers in the hematolymphoid tissues
[e.g., non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL),
Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and
leukemia] have been a central issue in the evalu-
ation for potential health consequences of pesti-
cide exposure. Particularly, NHL has received
research attention because the recent rapid
increase in its incidence parallels an exponential
growth in pesticide use with a few decades of
lag (Ries et al. 2003).
There have been extensive reviews
(Acquavella et al. 1998; Dich et al. 1997;
Maroni and Fait 1993; Morrison et al. 1992;
Zahm and Ward 1998) on cancer risk associ-
ated with farming and pesticide exposure as
well as a number of more recent articles on
speciﬁc types of cancer and speciﬁc classes of
pesticides (Blair et al. 1998; Buckley et al.
2000; Cantor et al. 2003; Hardell et al. 2002;
Kogevinas et al. 1995; McDufﬁe et al. 2001;
Meinert et al. 2000; Nanni et al. 1996;
Schroeder et al. 2001; Waddell et al. 2001;
Woods et al. 1987; Zahm et al. 1990; Zheng
et al. 2001). However, the vast majority of
those studies have focused only on occupa-
tional exposures, except for some childhood
cancer studies in which parental exposures in
and around the home were assessed (Buckley
et al. 2000; Meinert et al. 2000; Zahm and
Ward 1998). Because of the widespread use of
these chemicals in and around the home and
because of the longer time spent at home than
at work, especially among women, informa-
tion about pesticide use around the home is
critical to obtain a better picture of the overall
effects of pesticides in the general population.
In this population-based case–control study in
upstate New York, we attempted to address
whether pesticide product use at home as well
as at work is associated with increased risk of
NHL among women.
Materials and Methods
Study population. This study was designed as a
population-based case–control study of inci-
dent NHL in the upstate counties of New York
State (NYS; i.e., excluding New York City and
surrounding counties) to examine the associa-
tions with several environmental exposures.
The study population base consisted of women
20–79 years of age who lived in the defined
area of NYS at any time during the case-
ascertainment period. Males were excluded
because a primary focus of the study was on
hair dyes, which will be reported separately.

A population-based, incidence case–control study was conducted among women in upstate
New York to determine whether pesticide exposure is associated with an increase in risk of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) among women. The study involved 376 cases of NHL identiﬁed
through the State Cancer Registry and 463 controls selected from the Medicare beneﬁciary ﬁles
and state driver’s license records. Information about history of farm work, history of other jobs
associated with pesticide exposure, use of common household pesticide products, and potential
confounding variables was obtained by telephone interview. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs) were estimated using an unconditional logistic regression model. The risk of
NHL was doubled (OR = 2.12; 95% CI, 1.21–3.71) among women who worked for at least
10 years at a farm where pesticides were reportedly used. When both farming and other types of
jobs associated with pesticide exposure were combined, there was a progressive increase in risk of
NHL with increasing duration of such work (p = 0.005). Overall cumulative frequency of use of
household pesticide products was positively associated with risk of NHL (p = 0.004), which was
most pronounced when they were applied by subjects themselves. When exposure was analyzed by
type of products used, a signiﬁcant association was observed for mothballs. The associations with
both occupational and household pesticides were particularly elevated if exposure started in
1950–1969 and for high-grade NHL. Although the results of this case–control study suggest that
exposure to pesticide products may be associated with an increased risk of NHL among women,
methodologic limitations related to selection and recall bias suggest caution in inferring causation.

Research Article
Women with a prior history of any type of
hematologic cancer were also excluded from
the study population.
Cases were newly diagnosed with NHL
during the 3-year period between 1 October
1995 and 30 September 1998 and were iden-
tiﬁed through a rapid case-ascertainment sys-
tem coordinated with the NYS Cancer
Registry. The completeness of case ascertain-
ment was veriﬁed by linkages with the whole
state cancer registry database and with state
death certificates. From 722 initially identi-
ﬁed eligible cases, we excluded 3.4% because
their physician’s consent could not be
obtained and an additional 4.2% because we
could not ﬁnd a valid contact address of the
patients. Population-based controls were fre-
quency matched to the projected age distribu-
tion of the cases and were selected from an
age-stratified random sample from the NYS
Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) driver’s
license ﬁles for those < 65 years of age, or from
the Health Care Financing Administration
(HCFA) beneﬁciary ﬁles for those ≥ 65 years
of age. However, the frequency matching was
only partially successful because of age-related
differences in response rates. To increase com-
parability between cases and controls, we
excluded cases < 65 years of age without a valid
NYS driver’s license. No monetary incentives
were offered for participation. Among those
with valid address information who met all
other eligibility criteria, the ﬁnal participation
rate in the study was 56% (n = 376, with a
median age at diagnosis of 65 years) among the
cases, 30% (n = 248) among the DMV con-
trols, and 67% (n = 215) among the HCFA
controls. The participation rate of cases and
DMV controls was low in part because of a
requirement by the NYS Department of
Health institutional review board that they ﬁrst
be sent a study solicitation letter by the NYS
Cancer Registry; only if they returned a signed
consent form could we contact them for an
interview. Verbal consent to participate in the
study was approved by the New York
University (NYU) School of Medicine institu-
tional review board for the HCFA controls.
Demographic characteristics of the partici-
pants have been published elsewhere (Kato
et al. 2002). Brieﬂy, both the case and control
participants were primarily white (98%), born
in NYS (77%), and married (59%). Mean age
at the index date (deﬁned below) was 60.5 years
for the cases and 54.6 years for the controls.
More controls had a college education (61%)
than did cases (45%). The proportion of smok-
ers was similar in the two groups (22% in cases
and 19% in controls). Family history of hema-
tologic cancer was more common in cases
(11%) than in controls (6%).
Data collection. Cases and controls were
interviewed over the telephone by an inter-
viewer at NYU who was not aware of the
case–control status of the participants. The
structured questionnaire was developed speciﬁ-
cally for this study. Next of kin were inter-
viewed for the cases (20.5%) and controls
(3.2%) who were found to be deceased or
medically incapable of participating in an
interview. The most common surrogates were
children (47%), followed by husbands (27%).
In advance of the interview, each participant
was mailed a package containing a letter out-
lining the study and a booklet displaying lists
of product/chemical names to be discussed in
the interview. The median time between NHL
diagnosis and the telephone interview was
1.2 years, ranging from 2 months to 3.3 years.
Information was collected on the lifetime his-
tory of living or working on a farm, exposures
to pesticides from other types of jobs, and the
lifetime history of pesticide product use in and
around the home. For the subjects who
worked on a farm, we asked whether pesticides
were used on the farm and whether the pesti-
cides were applied by the subject herself. When
the subject applied or handled pesticides her-
self, details about pesticides (name and dura-
tion) were elicited. We asked about other
occupational exposures in three separate cate-
gories: insecticides, herbicides, and wood
preservatives. For each category, the number of
hours exposed per day, week, month, or year
and total duration of employment were
elicited. We asked about pesticide product use
in and around the home in 12 separate cate-
gories principally based on the purposes of
use: to control ants, cockroaches/silverfish,
bees, ﬂies/mosquitoes, moths (mothballs), or
termites; to treat indoor plants, trees/shrubs,
plants in the garden/outdoor pots, or lawns;
to control head lice; and use of an indoor/
outdoor fogger. For each group of pesticide
products, information on application methods
(indoor/outdoor and by self/others), year or
age ﬁrst used, year or age last used, and aver-
age frequency of use in a year/season was
elicited. Based on the average frequency and
total duration of use, we calculated the cumu-
lative number of uses for each product or
group of products as well as for each mode of
application.
Classiﬁcation of NHL. Copies of medical
records of the cases were obtained and
reviewed to conﬁrm their diagnosis and eligi-
bility. In addition, to allow for a uniform clas-
sification of NHL, pathology slides were
obtained and reviewed by an expert
hematopathologist at NYU (G.F.). It was pos-
sible to complete the review for 268 cases
(71%). Approximately 26% of these slides
were sent to a second expert hematopatholo-
gist consultant (J.S.B.) to resolve discrepancies
between the original diagnoses and the review
diagnoses at NYU. In our review, NHL was
classified according to both the REAL
(Revised European-American Classiﬁcation of
Lymphoid Neoplasms) system (Harris et al.
1994) and the Working Formulation
(Weisenburger 1992). Classification by
immunophenotype was based on the final
REAL categories from our pathologic review
whenever available, otherwise on the immuno-
phenotype obtained at the original institution.
If neither was available (9.8%), follicular lym-
phomas by histology were considered B-cell in
type, and the others were left unclassiﬁed. As a
result, 322 were considered B-cell, 25 T-cell,
and 29 unclassified. Lymphomas were also
grouped by grade based on the Working
Formulation: 54 low grade, 189 intermediate
grade, 25 high grade, and 8 unclassiﬁed.
Statistical analysis. In order to eliminate
reported exposures that occurred after diagno-
sis of NHL and to allow a minimum latency
(lag) period of 1 year from exposure to diag-
nosis for each case, we set an index date, after
which any exposures should be excluded from
the analysis. The index date was deﬁned as the
date 1 year before diagnosis. To ensure com-
parable exposure assessment periods between
cases and controls, within 5-year age strata we
randomly assigned lag periods (i.e., index
dates) to controls corresponding to the fre-
quency distribution of lags among the cases of
comparable age. Any exposures and events
reported after their index dates were dis-
counted for both cases and controls. The
average lag time between the index date and
the date of interview was 2.5 years for both
cases and controls.
The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confi-
dence intervals (95% CIs) for NHL according
to various indices for pesticide exposure were
calculated using the unconditional logistic
regression model (Breslow and Day 1980),
adjusted for selected covariates: four continu-
ous variables (age at index date, year of inter-
view, and frequencies of use of pain-relieving
drugs and of cortisone injections) and ﬁve indi-
cator variables (college education, surrogate
interview, family history of hematologic can-
cer, and personal history of eczema/hives and
of antihistamine use). These covariates were
selected according to the following three crite-
ria: a) known risk factors for NHL (age and
family history of hematologic cancer); b) fac-
tors that inﬂuence data quality (education, sur-
rogate status, and year of interview); and
c) potential risk factors associated with pesti-
cide product use/farm work (frequencies of use
of pain-relieving drugs and of cortisone injec-
tions and personal history of eczema/hives and
of antihistamine use) (Holly et al. 1999; Kato
et al. 2002; McWhorter 1988). Whenever pos-
sible, the ORs were calculated for ordered cate-
gories (in quartiles, tertiles, or halves) of
cumulative number of uses or total duration of
exposure, compared with nonusers or no-expo-
sure groups. Tests for linear trend in the logit
of risk with increasing frequency or duration of

exposure were performed using natural-log–
transformed continuous values. Selected analy-
ses were repeated for subtypes of lymphoma.
All statistical analyses were conducted using
SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
First, we examined the associations with poten-
tial exposure to pesticides at work (Table 1).
There was a marginal trend in risk of NHL
with the number of years worked on a farm
(p = 0.053). This trend became more signiﬁcant
(p = 0.03) when only farm work involving pes-
ticide use was considered. The OR associated
with such farm work of ≥ 10 years was 2.12
(95% CI, 1.21–3.71). Applying or handling
pesticides by the women themselves was not
associated with appreciably increased risk.
Furthermore, < 50% of the women who
applied/handled pesticides could recall the
product names; thus, evaluation by chemical
class of pesticides was not feasible. When types
of crops handled by the study subjects were
considered, the OR appeared to be higher for
vegetables, grain, and other crops than for fruits
and ﬂowers, although none of them was statisti-
cally signiﬁcant. Exposure to pesticides was also
reported under various types jobs other than
farming (n = 61). About half of these jobs
(n = 32) involved a passive low level of exposure
to periodic building/lawn treatment with pesti-
cides. Common jobs in this category were
restaurant jobs, ofﬁce work, and miscellaneous
other jobs. The second category of jobs (n = 9)
represented a possible intermediate level of
exposure, for example, retail jobs handling pes-
ticides, crop-processing factory work, or work-
ing in an office adjacent to a farm or florist.
The ﬁnal category of jobs represented occupa-
tions that may have entailed direct exposure to
pesticides through application (n = 20). This
consisted of structure maintenance or environ-
mental control jobs, horticultural work, veteri-
nary jobs, and wood-handling factory jobs. The
number of hours of actual exposure was
reported to be much shorter for the low-expo-
sure job category (median, 12 hr/year), com-
pared with those in the intermediate- and
high-exposure job categories (medians,
192 hr/year and 55 hr/year, respectively). With
increasing cumulative number of hours exposed
to pesticides at these jobs other than farming,
there was a marginal increasing trend in risk of
NHL (p = 0.08). When farming and other jobs
associated with pesticide exposure were com-
bined, the total duration at any of these jobs
was signiﬁcantly positively associated with the
risk of NHL (p = 0.005). This increase in risk
of NHL was more pronounced when exposure
started in 1950–1969 than when it first
occurred before or after this period.
The ORs and 95% CIs associated with
pesticide use in and around the home are pre-
sented in Table 2. We grouped products based
on the target pest. As a result, insecticides were
categorized into those for crawling insects
(ants, cockroaches/silverﬁsh, and termites), for
flying insects [bees, flies/mosquitoes, and
moths (except mothballs) and indoor/outdoor
fogger], mothballs, and antilice products.
Products to treat indoor plants, trees/shrubs, or
plants in garden/outdoor pots were combined
into one group, that is, fungicides/plant pesti-
cides. Products to treat lawns were considered
herbicides/lawn pesticides. Products to control
moths were assumed to be mothballs if they
were used exclusively indoors; otherwise, they
were counted in the categories for the flying
insects. Correlations among these groups of
home pesticide products ranged from –0.07
to 0.27. For all products combined, there was a
linear increase in risk of NHL with increasing
cumulative number of uses (p = 0.004). The
positive trend was observed for most of the
products groups, except for the herbicide and
fungicide groups. Logistic regression for indi-
vidual product groups with simultaneous
adjustment for use of all other products
revealed a significant positive association of
NHL with mothballs (p = 0.03) and a
marginally signiﬁcant association with insecti-
cides for flying insects/foggers (p = 0.07).
When no-exposure groups were excluded
from the trend analyses, the regression coefﬁ-
cient for mothballs approached zero, whereas
those for the others changed minimally.
When time of first use was analyzed for all
household pesticide products combined, the
association with NHL was signiﬁcant only for
pesticide use started during 1950–1969
(OR = 2.42; 95% CI, 1.16–5.02), whereas
weaker associations were found for pesticide use
started before 1950 or after 1969 (OR = 1.42
and 1.25, respectively; data not shown).
For pesticides for flying and crawling
insects and for all pesticide products combined,
we calculated the ORs for NHL according to
application methods that were separated into
three groups based on presumed exposure
intensity, namely, pesticides applied by the
respondent, applied indoors by others, or
applied outdoors by others (Table 3). For indi-
vidual groups of pesticide products, we also
adjusted for other pesticide use via the same
application method in these analyses. The
positive linear trend with cumulative number

of uses was most evident when pesticides were
applied by women themselves for all products
combined (p = 0.01), but the risk associated
with insecticides for ﬂying insects was only sig-
niﬁcant when they were applied outdoors by
others. The association with mothballs was
virtually the same when exposure occurred
through self use or use by others, although a
limited number of subjects were exposed
through use by others (data not shown).
We also examined combined and separate
effects of occupational and home pesticide
exposure. To study combination effects, we
divided exposures into two levels using the
medians: 10 years for duration of jobs associ-
ated with pesticide exposure and 70 times for
cumulative number of uses of any household
pesticide products. The OR was 2.33 (95%
CI, 0.93–5.85) for the subjects with higher
exposures for both (n = 54), 1.46 (95% CI,
0.72–2.98) for those with higher exposure
only at home or only at job (n = 381), and
1.00 (95% CI, 0.49–2.04) for those who had
lower exposure for both or combinations of
no exposure and lower exposure at home and
job (n = 354), compared with the subjects
with neither exposure (n = 48), and this trend
was statistically signiﬁcant (p = 0.005). When
the subjects were limited to those without any
occupational exposure to pesticides (n = 648),
the association with cumulative number of
uses of any type of home pesticide products
remained highly statistically significant
(p = 0.005). The number of women who were
not exposed to any home pesticide products
was too small (n = 54) to analyze the effects of
occupational exposure separately. However,
simultaneous adjustment for home pesticide
use did not affect the association with occupa-
tional pesticide exposure (p = 0.01).
Table 4 presents the results of analysis by
subtype of NHL according to levels of total
pesticide exposure from work and around the
home. There were no clear differences in
trends in the ORs between B-cell and T-cell
subtypes, but the increasing risk of NHL with
the number of years worked in pesticide-
related jobs and with the cumulative number
of any pesticide product uses around the home
was most pronounced for high-grade lym-
phoma (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively).
Discussion
The results of this case–control study suggest
that exposure to pesticide products may lead to
an increased risk of NHL among women. This
finding was supported by the dose–response
relationship observed with length of exposure,
cumulative number of uses, and potential
intensity of exposure.
Compared with studies using biologic or
environmental samples at single time points, a
questionnaire-based study has an advantage in
the assessment of long-term exposure by
reconstructing the whole personal history.
However, it also has limitations. First, there
may be bias in recall: cases with serious disease
may be likely to report hypothesized exposures
more completely than controls in good health.
This especially may occur when there is
enhanced public health concern about an
exposure (Infante-Rivard and Jacques 2000;
Weinstock et al. 1991), as may be the case for
pesticides.
Obtaining information on speciﬁc chemi-
cals over a long period of time is challenging,
given the large number of products on the
market, but is crucial when exposure effects
may be cumulative. For nonoccupational
exposure, Teitelbaum (2002) has suggested
that asking about treatments for speciﬁc pest
problems may be an effective way to help sub-
ject recall, a practice we implemented in
designing our questionnaires. Notably, reason-
able correlations have been observed between
self-reported household chemical use and
measurements of pesticides and their metabo-
lites in urine of household members (Kieszak
et al. 2002) and in indoor air (Van Winkel
and Scheff 2001). Therefore, this type of
questionnaire design seems useful in the
assessment of household pesticides, at least for
recent exposure. One shortcoming of our
assessment of nonoccupational pesticide
exposure is that we did not include dietary
exposure, which may contribute a substantial
fraction of pesticide exposures (Whitmore
et al. 1994; Yess et al. 1991). However, mis-
classiﬁcation of exposure due to the omission
of dietary sources is most likely to be nondif-
ferential because many foods are known to
contain pesticide residues (Yess et al. 1991).
It has been suggested that self-reported
occupational pesticide exposure tends to over-
estimate exposure (Daniels et al. 2001; Meinert
et al. 2000) because people often do not know

for sure about actual chemical contents used at
their work places. Farmers may be an excep-
tion (Blair and Zahm 1990), but indeed fewer
than half of the women who applied pesticide
themselves in this study could recall at least
one of the product names they used. This pro-
portion appears to be lower than in farmer
studies (Dosemeci et al. 2002; Zahm et al.
1993) but may be because most of the farm
work was in the distant past (median interval
between last farm work and interview was
37 years, and median duration of farm work
was only 8 years). Poor recall may also account
for our failure to detect an excess risk among
women who applied or handled pesticides.
However, reentry to areas that were recently
treated with pesticides for harvesting may
result in greater cumulative exposure to pesti-
cide residues than application itself (Garcia
2003); Coronado et al. (2004) recently
reported that detectable levels of pesticide
metabolite were not higher among workers
who were engaged in mixing, loading, or
applying pesticide formulations than among
those who did not perform these tasks, con-
trary to expectation. Some investigators have
found that including information from surro-
gates biases the results (Blair and Zahm 1990;
Waddell et al. 2001), but when we limited our
analysis to the subjects themselves, the strength
of the associations remained almost the same as
those observed in the entire sample.
Finally, the relatively low overall participa-
tion rate in this study raises issues of selection
bias and of generalizability of the results. The
probable reasons for the lower response rates
among the DMV controls and the cases have
been discussed elsewhere (Kato et al. 2002).
Cases in this study were similar in age
distribution to all the cases diagnosed in NYS
during the same time period, but white and
married women were overrepresented in both
the case and control groups. Although we do
not have external data to estimate the magni-
tude of selection bias, the results of hypotheti-
cal sensitivity analyses based on a selection bias
factor defined by Rothman and Greenland
(1998) suggest that the ORs obtained in this
study are more likely to have been underesti-
mated than overestimated. This relies on an
assumption that exposed controls were more
likely to respond to this survey than were
nonexposed controls because both the study
invitation letter and the study packet (prod-
uct list) indicated that pesticides were one of
our major research interests, whereas this
selection should play a minor role among the

cases who were already motivated because of
their diagnosed disease. In addition, the
DMV controls, who were < 65 years of age
and had a lower overall participation rate
than cases, may have been more motivated to
participate in research related to environmen-
tal issues and therefore may have had better
recall of pesticide exposure. This would tend
to counterbalance the hypothesized biased
recall among cases discussed above, unless
such motivated people tend to live in better
housing conditions that require less use of
pesticides.
It is possible that pesticide use is a marker
for other possible causative factors for NHL.
For instance, occupational exposure to pesti-
cides is often accompanied by exposure to
other possible hazardous substances, such as
solvents, fuels, and dusts (Maroni and Fait
1993; Morrison et al. 1992), that have been
associated with increased NHL risk (Mao
et al. 2000; Rego 1998). Similarly, people
who use pesticides in and around the home
may tend to use other household chemicals
more often than those who do not. Another
possibility is that pesticide use is an indicator
of exposure to insects that may act as vectors
to transmit viruses and bacteria. Certain types
of viruses and bacteria have been identiﬁed as
etiologic factors for NHL (Pagano 2002;
Persing and Prendergast 1999).
Some earlier studies have pointed to associ-
ations between specific types of pesticide or
pesticide groups and NHL risk (Dich et al.
1997). Three groups of pesticides have received
special research attention: phenoxy herbicides
and organochlorine and organophosphate
insecticides. However, the results have been
inconclusive because initial positive findings
that were usually based on small numbers of
subjects have often not been confirmed in
larger studies or in multivariate analyses taking
other pesticides into consideration (Cantor
et al. 2003; Hardell et al. 2002; Morrison et al.
1992). In this study, we were not able to ana-
lyze any specific classes of chemicals because
the women had limited recall of the particular
chemicals used. Yet, the ﬁnding that pesticide
use starting in 1950–1969 was associated with
the most pronounced risk of NHL suggests a
potential role of organochlorine insecticides
that became widely available during this period.
Alternatively, it may be a chance finding or
simply indicate that a 25–45 year latency
period is typical of pesticide-induced NHL.
A ﬁnding that is relatively unique in this
study is the increased risk of NHL associated
with mothball use, although a dose response
was not clearly demonstrated among users. In
the United States, major chemical constituents
of mothballs are naphthalene or para-
dichlorobenzene (p-DCB). These chemicals
are also constituents of other common house-
hold products, such as air fresheners and solid
toilet bowl deodorizers, which were not
included in our questionnaire. Vapors from
mothballs can be absorbed not only by inhala-
tion but also by direct skin contact. Both of
these chemicals are known to have hematotox-
icity, including reports of hemolytic anemia
(Hallowell 1959; Santucci and Shah 2000)
and aplastic anemia (Harden and Baetjer
1978). In addition, in vitro and in vivo studies
have demonstrated cytotoxicity and genotoxic-
ity of these chemicals and their metabolites
(Bagchi et al. 1998; Brusick 1986; Carbonell
et al. 1991; Tingle et al. 1993), and carcino-
genicity has been shown in animal models
(Preuss et al. 2003; Umemura et al. 1992).
Importantly, both naphthalene and p-DCB
are among the most ubiquitously detected
hazardous household chemicals in indoor air
(Van Winkel and Scheff 2001), and concen-
trations in indoor air samples and urine sam-
ples of residents are correlated with reported
mothball use (Kieszak et al. 2002; Van Winkel
and Scheff 2001). This suggests that the asso-
ciation between mothball use and NHL merits
further investigation.
We found that the association with pesti-
cide exposure was most pronounced for high-
grade lymphoma. The results for subtypes of
NHL, however, should be interpreted cau-
tiously because of small numbers of cases by
subtype and because of the multiple compar-
isons involved. Data have been limited and
inconsistent in earlier studies concerning types
of lymphoma associated with pesticide expo-
sure. There have been reports of relatively
stronger associations of various types of agri-
cultural insecticides with low-grade lymphoma
(Nanni et al. 1996), carbamate insecticides
with small lymphocytic lymphoma (Zheng
et al. 2001), organophosphate pesticides and
phenoxy herbicides with intermediate grade
lymphoma (Waddell et al. 2001; Zahm et al.
1990), and phenoxy herbicides with B-cell
lymphoma (Zahm et al. 1990). Schroeder
et al. (2001) reported that a type of B-cell
lymphoma that carries a speciﬁc chromosomal
translocation was associated with occupational
exposure to several types of pesticides. Finally,
a case–control study of NHL among children
revealed that the associations with parental
occupational and household exposure to pesti-
cides were more clear for higher grade lym-
phomas, whereas there were no differences
between B- and T-cell types (Buckley et al.
2000). Although mechanistic bases for possi-
ble carcinogenic actions by pesticides are
largely unknown, Schroeder et al. (2001) spec-
ulate that they are different from those for
NHL linked to immunosuppression, based on
their observation of a speciﬁc genetic change
associated with pesticide exposure.
In conclusion, the results of our case–
control study suggest an association of pesticide
exposures with NHL. However, methodologic
limitations related to selection and recall bias
suggest caution in inferring causation. In order
to draw more definitive conclusions and to
make public recommendations, more research
is needed, integrating various types of studies,
such as surveillance for personal pesticide
product use, development and application of
new biomarkers for pesticide exposure, and
assessment of genetic polymorphisms related
to pesticide metabolism.
