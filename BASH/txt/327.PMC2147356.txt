POPULATIONS OF ANIMAL RED BLOOD CELLS TAGGED
WITH RADIOIRON*

(Received for publication, September 15, 1952)
Until recently, only a few studies (1-6) of red cell life span in a limited
number of animal species had been made. These early studies, made by a variety
of methods, gave estimates of red cell life span for certain species that varied
widely (e.g. rabbit 8 to 42 days, dog 20 to 124 days). Recently, Finch and co-
workers (7) employing radioiron, and Bale et al. (8) employing Ca* have
estimated the life span of the dog red cell to be 107 to 110 and 115 days, re-
spectively. Harrison and associates (9) using radioiron, and Neuberger and
Niven (10)using N15-1abeled glycine estimated the life span of rabbit red cells
to be 62 to 75 days. Valentine and others (11) using N 15have estimated the
mean life span of the cat red cell at 77 days.
The use of isotopes in tagging erythrocytes for in vivo survival studies is subject
to certain criticism. Previous investigators (8, 12, 13) have shown that there is no
apparent loss or exchange of the isotopes of iron, nitrogen, or carbon when once in-
corporated into the hemoglobin molecule. However, radioiron is rapidly and almost
completely reutflized following red cell breakdown unless suppressed by the compe-
tition of greatly increased body stores of non-radioactive iron and continuous high
levels of non-radioactive total serum iron (7, 14). N15incorporated in the protopor-
phyrin of heine and C14-taggedglobin are supposedly not reutilized in the formation
of new hemoglobin. Nevertheless, red ceil survival curves based on these technics,
published to date (8, 10, 11, 13, 15), show considerable amounts (10 to 30 per cent of
maximal uptake) of both N~5and C1' persisting in circulating red cells for periods up
to 200 days. In addition, the relatively slow uptake and early decline in the Nis level
(40 to 60 days) lead to great difficulty in estimating with an accuracy the average
life span and variations in red cell life.
Recent investigations (7-10) have revealed varying degrees of random destruction
of red cells occurring in apparently healthy normal animals--a fact which further
complicates in d~o survival studies. While isotope reutilization and random destruction

of cells have not been considered in previous survival studies of animal red cells, it
is obvious that these factors, when present, would definitely influence the terminal
slopes of survival curves obtained.
Admittedly, the Ashby technic of differential agglutination (16, 17) probably re-
mains superior to all other methods for determining red cell survival. Unfortunately,
most animal blood-grouping sera, except for a few sera recently produced and now
under study (18, 19), have been incapable of causing sufficiently cohesive agglutination
to permit this latter technic to be used.t Thus it would appear that the use of radio-
iron, in conjunction with non-radioactive iron administered intravenously to suppress
radioiron reutilization as originally suggested by Finch (7), is perhaps as practical
as any of the methods currently available for studies of animal red cell survival.
The present interest in red blood cell preservation indicates a need for em-
ploying animals in initial in dro survival studies of red cells processed and pre-
served by certain methods. This has prompted us to make new studies in normal
dogs, cats, and rabbits. We have studied in these species red cell populations
of limited age tagged with radiorion in an attempt to more accurately define
the average red cell life span, variations of red cell life, random destruction,
and the fraction of radioiron reutilized.
Materials and Methods
Animals.--Both sexes of three species of animals which had reached full growth and
stable body weights were used. All were housed in individual cages. Mongrel dogs
weighing 8 to 12 kilos were maintained on a stock diet of Purina dog chow supple-
mented with cooked horse meat and bone scraps. The dogs were immunized to canine
distempter and examined frequently for any signs of infection, systemic disease, and
parasitic infestations including mange and blood larvae of Dirofilaria immitis. All
dogs were dewormed of intestinal parasites just prior to the experiment and peri-
odically thereafter.
New Zealand white rabbits weighing 3 to 4 kilos and maintained on Purina rabbit
chow supplemented with oats and greens were used. All rabbits remained free of ear
mites, eye infections, "snuffles," and other signs of disease.
Cats weighing 3 to 4 kilos were employed and maintained on a diet of commercial
("Daily"): cat food supplemented with cooked horse meat, raw liver, and milk.
All eats were immunized to feline agranulocytosis and remained free of intestinal
parasites and other infestations and infections throughout the experimental period.
At the conclusion of the experiment all animals were sacrificed and examined by au-
topsy. Tissue sections for microscopic study were made of various organs from most
animals in order to confirm the absence of lesions or disease.
l In 1946 Jope (20) reported studies that indicated sulfhemoglobin disappeared
from the blood only upon decay of the red cells containing it. Jope suggested sulf-
hemoglobin as a chemical tag for following red cell survival. Recently, we have made
extensive studies, to be reported elsewhere, which fail to support Jope's observations
and suggestions.

TechnicalMahods Emplo,yed.--Red cell volumes were determined by the cell dilu-
tion technic employing Fe~-tagged (21) red cells from compatible donors of the same
species, or by the Evans blue dye--hematocrit method modified after Gibson and
Evans (22). When employing the Evans blue dye procedure, a correction factor was
used. This was determined for each species by the radioiron-tagged cell dilution
technic in order to correct for the difference in venous and tQtal body hematocrit
readings. Dye determinations were made on the Beckman DU or Coleman Jr. spectro-
photometers. All hematocrit readings were determined by ~entrifugalizing at 3000
o
R.I'.M. at a relative centrifugal force (R.C.F.) of 1800 at cor/stant temperature (5 C.)
for 30 minutes. Special calibrated rubber-tipped hematocrit tubes were employed.
These tubes allow the packed red cells from 0.5 cc. to 5 cc. aliquots of whole blood
to be determined to the nearest 0.01 cc. and recovered quantitatively and separately
from the superuatant plasma. A correction factor for entrapped plasma, determined
for our centrifuging conditions by the Im method of Leeson and Reeve (23), was
applied to all hematocrit readings. Hemoglobin was determined by the method of
Evelyn and Malloy (24) with readings made spectrophotometrically.
All dogs used in transfusion experiments were grouped according to the ABCD
dog blood groups of Young (25, 26), to the XYZ dog Mood groups of Hamilton (27),
and to other immune dog isoantibodies produced in this laboratory (28). Only donor
dogs of compatible blood groups were chosen, and donor and recipient dogs were
cross-matched before transfusion according to Young's procedure (25) and by the
indirect anti-globulin test employing an anti-dog globulin rabbit serum. Similar
pretransfusion blood grouping and compatibility studies were made prior to rabbit
and cat transfusions. The blood groups of the rabbits and eats were determined by
immune Mood grouping antisera produced in this laboratory (28). Included among
the rabbit blood grouping antisera were rabbit sera containing antibodies identical
in specificity to those recently described by Kellner (29) as rabbit "anti-G" and
anti-g." Cross-matching of donors and recipients of these species was performed
using albumin and serum-suspended red cells and by the indirect anti-globulin test
using anti-rabbit globulin eat sera (for rabbits) and anti-cat globulin rabbit sera
(for cats).
All recipient animals' sera were tested frequently throughout the experimental
period for the presence of immune isoantibodies which might have been stimulated
by the transfused blood. Donor blood for transfusion was drawn into cold (1-2°C.)
ACD solution in silicone-treated glass containers submerged in an ice bath which
immediately chilled the shed blood to 1-2°C. Dog donor blood was stored for 12
hours at 2-5°C. before transfusion, but all transfusions in the other species were
administered immediately after the blood was withdrawn from the donor animals.
Radioirons Fe55,of high specific activity (522.7 inc. as FebS/gm. of Fe and contain-
ing less than 0.196 inc. as Fe~/gm. of Fe), was employed in all the survival studies.
The Fe~nradioactivity of all red blood samples was assayed by a Geiger-Mueller tube
sensitive to soft x-rays and shielded to low energy beta irradiation* (Fe~) by a beryl-
8Obtained from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
4When Fe~ was employed to determine total red cell volume, samples were counted

lium absorber 150 mg./cm,s in thickness. The efficiency of this tube with the absorber
in detecting soft x-rays was approximately 2.0 per cent.
The total red cell volume removed with each blood sample was wet ashed, the
hemoglobin iron electroplated, and the radioactivity determined after the method of
Peacock et al. (30) with some slight modifications and refinements in technic. A
standard of the original radioiron injected was prepared and counted with each sample
assayed in order to correct for radioactive decay and error due to any slight changes
in scalar sensitivity.
Experimental ProceAure.--After initial determinations of red cell volume, each
animal (excepting those used as transfusion recipients) was given intravenously Fe5s
in the form of dilute ferric chloride. The dosage of Fess employed was as follows: dogs
0.06 mg. of Fe representing 7.8 X 10s c.p.x~.5or approximately 55 #c., rabbits and cats
0.02 mg. of Fe representing 2.6 X 105 c.P.M, or approximately 18.3 go. Frequent blood
samples, representing usually 1 to 2 cc. of packed red cells, were taken from all animals
during the initial period of radioiron uptake and later during the period of decline of
circulating red cell radioactivity level with less frequent sampling in the interval.
The total volume of red blood cells removed at each sampling was determined for
each animal using the special centrifuge tubes and hematocrit procedure described
previously. The total red cell volume removed at each sampling was used for the radio-
iron assay. Thus, the amount of circulating red cell radioactivity removed at each
sampling, expressed as a ratio of c.P.~, removed in the sample to c.P.~, of the Fes
standard, could be determined by the following equation,
c.P.M,in red cellsremoved in sample

The total circulating red cellradioactivity at the time of each sampling, expressed
as the ratio of the c.p.~r,in the totalcirculating red cellsto c.P.M, of the Fe 6sstandard
to correct for radioactive decay, was determined by the following equation:
~c.P.~.per cc. red cellsin sample X animals totalred cellvolume in cc.

Because the amount of red cellradioactivity removed by sampling was not insignifi-
cant with respect to the total circulating red cellradioactivity, it was necessary to
correct for this.The correction used was that suggested by Valentine et al. (11) which
assumes that the animals' red cellvolumes remain relativelyconstant throughout the
experiment. If at is the total circulating red cell radioactivity at the time of the first
sample, and if b~ is the red cell radioactivity removed in that sample, then the total
circulating red cell radioactivity at the time of the second sample, as, must be di-
vided by

etc.
Once the curve of rapid radioiron uptake neared its plateau, each animal was
given intravenously large doses of non-radioactive iron in the form of saccharated
iron oxide (proferrin): Dogs were given 100 rag. of Fe as proferrin daily for the first
10 days after the initial uptake period, then 3 to 4 times weekly throughout the re-
mainder of the experimental period. The same procedure was followed in the rabbits
and cats except that the individual doses employed in these species was 40 rag. of
Fe as proferrin. Recipient animals used in transfusion experiments were also given
proferrin intravenously, The same doses for each species as indicated above were
given 3 to 4 times per week for at least 3 weeks prior to transfusion and continued
thereafter throughout the experimental period.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Theoretical Considerations
The mathematical analysis of total circulating red cell radioactivity data
thus obtained must take account of three factors: senescence, random de-
struction, and reutilization. Random destruction is assumed to be a process
which continuously removes a constant fraction of the cells present at any
moment, irrespective of age or other characteristics. Kinetically it resembles
a chemical first order reaction. Thus, if we start out with No isotopically tagged
cells of approximately the same age, the number, N, remaining at a time t
will be given by the equation
N = No r'~' (1)
in which k is the constant of random destruction.
The second assumption is that there is a "normal" distribution of life spans
around an average of T days. To formulate this the "probability integral"
may be used, following Shemin and Rittenberg (13), but the Verhulst-Pearl
(31) growth function is simpler and describes the facts equally well. Neither
formula has, of course, any theoretical basis. The growth function gives, in
this case, the fraction of the original number of tagged cells that will remain
at a time t under this assumption. If there were no random destruction this
would be a fraction of the number of cells originally tagged, but under condi-
tions in which there is random decay it is the fraction of ceils remaining after
random destruction. Hence

T is the average life span. a may be called a constant of uniformity: the greater
its numerical value, the narrower is the spread around the average life span.
This equation, however, would apply only if there were no reutilization of the
radioiron into newly formed red cells.
The third assumption is that under the conditions of these experiments a
constant fraction, b, of the tagged iron is reutilized in new red cell formation
when it is released by red cell destruction. This could only be expected when
conditions with respect to iron metabolism are relatively constant. In order to
achieve this, in each of our experiments the serum and body non-radioactive
iron was maintained at high levels by continual intravenous injections. Al-
though it was clear that the degree of reutilization of radioiron varied somewhat
from animal to animal and particularly with the amount of non-radioactive
iron administered, there was nothing to indicate that it was not constant in the
same animal under the same conditions.
By differentiating Equation 2 we obtain the rate of destruction of tagged
cells and therefore the rate of release of radioactive iron.
de [1 + e=(t-r)] '
The net rate of loss of tagged iron is assumed to be (1 -- b) times this. Multi-
plying by this factor, and integrating,
No (1 -- b)e-k'
N = -~ No b (4)
1 ~ e~(¢-T)
since when t is zero N equals No, e-k' is 1, and e~(~'r) is negligibly small.
Certain properties of this expression make it possible to fit the data to it
and obtain values for the constants. When t is large e-~t is very small and the
denominator .very large, so that N tends to reach the limit Nob. In practice,
N for times immediately following the sharp, S-shaped portion of the curve
may be taken as equal to Nob. The early part of the curve, during the initial
falling phase, represents a period when e~(~-r) does not differ appreciably from
zero, and the equation consequently simplifies to
N ----No (l -- b)e~' -t- No b (5)
If values for this period are used and the logarithm of (N -- Nob) is plotted
against time, the points will fall on a straight line whose slope is k and whose
intercept on the Y-axis is log No(1 -- b). From this, knowing the value of
Nob, the values of No and b may be obtained separately. To find T and a, values
of No(1 -- b)e-kt are computed for the middle period of the curve and par-
ticularly for the period in which the sharp drop usually occurs. They are di-
vided by the corresponding values of (N - Nob) and 1 is subtracted from the
result. The natural logarithm of the number thus obtained is plotted against
I. W. BROWN, JR., AND G. S. EADIE 333
time, The points again fall on a straight line whose slope is a and whose inter-
cept on the Y-axis is aT. The value of T can then be obtained by a simple
division.

For convenience T has been calculated from the time of the period of ad-

within 48 hours, it is sufficiently accurate to subtract 1 day from this value of

T. The rate of uptake affects also the value of a. The more rapid the uptake of
radioiron, the greater the value of this constant. The results of this analysis
when applied to the total circulating red cell radioactivity data of the animals
studied are given in Table I.
Analysis of Data
Fig. 1 shows typical curves of circulating red cell radioactivity levels in the
normal dog, rabbit, and cat after intravenous injection of radioiron. As noted
by previous investigators (7, 9, 32), the rise in concentration of circulating red
cell radioactivity is extremely rapid until approximately three-fourths or more
of the ultimate level is reached. This is particularly true if extremely small
doses of iron of high specific activity are administered as in these experiments.
This is shown in Figs. 1 and 2 by dotted lines which simply join the actual
points determined and have no theoretical significance.
Following the initial period of rapid utilization of iron (usually 2 to 4 days)
there follows a period of slower uptake lasting 5 to 7 days, representing in most
animals 5 to 20 per cent of the total amount of radioiron utilized. This has been
neglected in the mathematical derivation of our curves, and the total uptake
is assumed to occur at the same rate as the initial rapid phase. This neglect
has two effects. In the first place, the cells formed in the slow radioiron uptake
phase will outlive, on the average, the cells formed earlier, and will be present
to a large extent in the blood after the end of the major senescence phase,
that is, the period of sharp drop. We have considered that any radioactivity
remaining at this time is due to reutilized radioactive iron, but, since these
cells from the original uptake period still persist, this is not strictly true. The
apparent degree of reutilization is therefore increased. Secondly, the S-shaped
part of the curve resulting from the distribution of life spans around an average
will be rendered somewhat skew by an apparent increase in life spans of those
cells living longer than the average. Finally, the average life span will be
apparently increased to a slight extent. These effects are relatively small.
This is shown with respect to skewness by the fact that the experimental
points do not diverge from the theoretical lines (solid lines Figs. 1, 2, and 5)
which are not skew by more than can be attributed to experimental error and
the usual biological variations in the daily state of the animals such as slight
fluctuations in total red cell volumes.
From the time of maximum concentration of circulating red cell radioiron
the data fit the equation, as shown in Fig. 1, as closely as could be expected.
Moreover, during the fitting, when values for log No(1 -- b) were plotted
against time, in every case they fell on a straight line, as postulated previ-
ously. This was also invariably the case when

was plotted against time. These findings increased confidence in the validity
of the equations.
From Table I it will be seen that the average life span of the rabbit erythro-
cyte is 57.5 days with a standard error of the mean of 1.52 days. This agrees
well with the previous values of 75 days (Harrison et al. (9)) and 65 to 70 days
(Neuberger and Niven (10)). For the cat the value of 72 days is slightly shorter
than the average value of 77 days given by Valentine et al. (11), but only half
their values were between 72.5 and 81.5 days. They did not, however, take
account of reutilization, and this tends to lengthen the apparent life span. The
value for the dog, 107 days, is somewhat shorter than the 115 days given by
Bale et a/. (8), but practically identical with the 106 to 109 day life span for
dogs reported by Finch et al. (7).
The life span as determined by transfusion experiments was found to be the
same as when followed in the same animal (Fig. 2). The life spans of tagged
homologous red cells transfused into two rabbits were 56 and 76 days, the
average being 65 days which is as close as can be expected to the average of
57.7 obtained in animals whose own cells were originally tagged. The trans-
fused cats had an average red cell life span of 65 days which is within the
expected range, but slightly shorter than the 72 days of the non-transfused cats.
Homologous cells transfused into dogs had almost exactly the same life span
as those in non-transfused dogs. Thus, transfusions of fresh normal animal red
cells confirm the values for life spans obtained without transfusion. Averaging
the values for the transfusion experiments with the values of the non-trans-
fused animals gives the followingaverage life spans with the respective standard
errors of the mean: rabbit, 67.6 d: 1.94; cat, 68.4 ± 1.50; and dog, 107 ± 1.14.
Only in the case of the cat, in which the number of animals is small, is there
a change in the average value, but even here the standard error does not indi-
cate any unduly wide range of life spans as compared with other animals
studied.
Small variations in the coefficients of uniformity of life span are largely
independent of the rate of uptake of radioiron, as shown by comparison with
the column (Table I) giving percentages of the total radioiron uptake oc-
curring in the first 48 hours. Apparently, therefore, another factor such as
individual biological variation affects this coefficient. The differences in the
coefficient for cats 1 and 2, however, are due, to a significant extent, to the
former factor. Cat 1 utilized 67 per cent of its total uptake of radioiron in 3
days, while cat 2 utilized only 38 per cent of its total radioiron uptake in the
same period of time. As will be noted from Table I, the coefficientsof uniformity
for the cat and rabbit agree quite closely. This coefficientfor the dog is slightly
greater averaging 0.258. This indicates the variation of red cell life in the dog
is slightly less than in the former species.

however, is an underestimate, as explained above, because the uptake of radio-
iron is not instantaneous. For this reason, the variation of 4-14 days is too high,
and the true value is probably 1 or 2 days less. We are not aware of any previ-
ous data on variations in animal red cell llfe. However it is of interest that this
latter variation of 4-12-14 days for the dog agrees quite closely with Mollison's
"rough estimate" (33) of 12 days, under the same circumstances, for human
red cells.~ Mollison's estimate for human red cells would indicate a value for

same age would theoretically disappear during a period of 17 days before and
after the average life span. Therefore, their theoretical variations of red cell
life span are the same when plotted with respect to their average red cell life
(Fig. 4).

The coefficient of random destruction is about the same for cats and rabbits,
but it is considerably smaller for the dog. In two dogs it was zero within the
limits of error of the methods employed. After transfusion of the same donor
tagged reticulocytes to be relatively normal in spite of a progressive loss of circulating
radioactivity commencing immediately following transfusion. In order to consider
these latter cells normal, it would have to be assumed that some normal red ceils have
relatively short life spans. This assumption is not supported by survival curves of
normal human cells obtained by Ashby counts (33) and differs from our present
findings of animals cells in which the variation of red cell life is rdatively small. Per-
haps these observations of Finch et aI. (7) are better explained by the recent work of
Hamilton a al. (34) which reveals that transfused normal red cells (as well as the
patient's own red cells) disappear in a random fashion if subjected to the circulation
of a patient with inadequately treated pernicious anemia.

mately the same as the coefficient of random destruction found for the un-
transfused dog 3 (Table I). In the second transfused dog this coefficient was
somewhat greater. Evidence is insufficient here to draw more detailed conclu-
sions. However, from these and other experiments (7-10) it appears that ani-
mals of these three species, unlike man, may exhibit varying degrees of random

destruction of normal red cells even when in apparently normal health. As
yet, we have found no explanation for this random red cell destruction in our
animals.
Fig. 5 illustrates the application of the mathematical treatment described
to an abnormally rapid random destruction of transfused normal red cells
encountered in one of our earlier experiments prior to finding suitable cat blood
grouping sera. As shown by the curve (solid line Fig. 5), there was a sudden
rapid elimination of the transfused red cells after a period of normal survival
in the recipient cat of approximately 6 days. Although no isoagglutinins to
the donor's cells could be found in the recipient cat prior to transfusion, co-

incident with the rapid elimination of donor cells, the recipient cat developed
potent isoantibodies which strongly agglutinated the donor cells in high titer.
The theoretical curve of elimination (solid line Fig. 5) was obtained by the
mathematical analysis of the data employing a random destruction coefficient
of approximately 10 times (0.201) that usually encountered in cats (0.02).
There was no evidence of any significant loss of cells by senescence, and it was
obvious that the sudden and rapid elimination of donor cells was caused by the
isoagglutinin provoked by the transfusion. This latter curve should be com-
pared with the theoretical curve of survival obtained for the donor animal
(dotted line Fig. 5) in which red cell life span was normal and senescence was
the chief cause of cell disappearance. This demonstrates the possible appli-
cation of the mathematical treatment described to studies of red cell survi-
val by radioiron in animals, such as red cell preservation experiments in which
varying rates of red cell destruction might be encountered.
The size of the fraction of radioiron reutilized in new red cell formation de-
pends in large part on the excess stores and continual supply of non-radio-
active iron administered intravenously. It is unlikely that complete suppression
of reutilization of radioiron would have resulted from larger and more frequent
injections of non-radioactive iron. It should be pointed out that the size of the
excess iron stores is only one factor to be considered. Perhaps the frequency
of administration of non-radioactive iron in maintaining a near saturated
serum iron-binding capacity is of equal or greater importance.
SUMMARY
Animal red blood cell in vivo survival curves, obtained by the radioiron tag-
ging of populations of approximately the same age followed by the adminis-
tration of non-radioactive iron to suppress radioiron reutilization, have been
subjected to mathematical analysis on the basis of the three following
assumptions :--
(A) Red blood cells disappear from the circulation as the result of senescence:
there is an average life span around which the life spans of individual cells
are distributed in the usual way.
(B) Red blood cells may be removed from the circulation by a process of
random destruction which continuously removes a constant fraction of the
cells present at any moment irrespective of age or other characteristics.
(C) Under the conditions of the experiments described, a fraction of the
radioiron, constant for each animal, is reutilized in new red cell formation
when released by red cell destruction.
This mathematical analysis indicates the following average life spans with
the respective standard errors of the mean: dog 107 days -4- 1.14; rabbit 67.6
days 4- 1.94; cat 68.4 4- 1.50.
The mathematical treatment presented has permitted a consideration of
342 ANALYSIS OF RED CELL SITRVIVAL IN ANIMALS
the theoretical variation of red cell life spans which was found in these experi-
ments to be relatively small for all three species studied. In the rabbit and cat
2.5 per cent of tagged populations of red cells of the same age would theo-
retically have disappeared by senescence 17 days before the average life span
was reached. The variation of red cell life in the dog was slightly less.
Animals of the three species studied, in spite of apparently normal health,
exhibited varying degrees of random destruction of both autogenous and
transfused fresh normal homologous red ceils. As yet, we have no explanation
for this random loss of ceils occurring in apparently healthy normal animals.
The method of mathematical analysis presented is applicable to animal
red cell survival studies employing radioiron in which differing rates of random
destruction are operating in the removal of red cells.
