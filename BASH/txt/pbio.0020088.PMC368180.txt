Scientists searching for clues
to our origins have long relied on
studying fossils to piece together our
evolutionary history.Now,with the tools
of molecular genetics,they can reach
beyond morphological evidence to
retrieve traces of DNA preserved in the
remnants of bone.And in these ancient
DNA sequences,they’re ﬁnding bits and
pieces of the evolutionary record.Over
the course of evolution,changes in DNA
sequences accumulate at a predictable
rate.These mutations can
reveal not only how closely
related we are but also when
evolutionary lineages diverged.
Identifying both a typical
range of genetic variation and
rate of mutation for a given
species or population,for
example,can serve as a frame
of reference for analyzing
DNA sequences from other
species or populations.Most
molecular anthropologists use
DNA found in mitochondria—
intracellular structures that
convert food into energy—to
reconstruct human evolution.
Distinct from nuclear DNA,
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
exists in the cytoplasm of a
fertilized egg and is passed on
only through the maternal lineage.
An ongoing debate about human
origins has revolved around the
theory that Homo sapiens and Homo
Neanderthalensis interbred,since the
two species coexisted.Neandertals lived
roughly 150,000 to 30,000 years ago,
toward the end of the Pleistocene era,
and inhabited Europe,parts of Asia,and
the Middle East.Modern-day humans
arose between 100,000 and 200,000
years ago.Recently,an international
multidisciplinary team of scientists
led by Svante Pbo of the Max Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology
have analyzed the largest sample of
Neandertal and early human remains
to date and conclude that Neandertals
could not have made a signiﬁcant genetic
contribution to early modern humans.
Part of the challenge of resolving the
human–Neandertal interbreeding issue
stems from the fact that so many fossil
samples—of both early humans and
more archaic humans—are contaminated
with the DNA of the contemporary
humans who have handled them.So
even if a Neandertal sample contained
a“real”(or endogenous) DNA sequence
resembling early humans—which
would indicate intimacy between the
two groups—it might be considered
contaminated.When Pääbo and
colleagues looked for modern DNA,
they found it in every sample they
examined:in the Neandertal and early
human fossils—and even in cave bear
teeth.To circumvent this problem,they
looked only for Neandertal mtDNA as
evidence of interbreeding.Since it is easy
to distinguish modern human mtDNA
sequences from the four Neandertal
mtDNA samples that have been
sequenced so far,the researchers decided
to determine whether Neandertal-
like mtDNA could be found in other
Neandertal fossils as well as in early
human remains.
As these fossils are precious
commodities,Pbo’s group applied a
technique developed in their lab that
uses amino acid content as a measure
of extractable endogenous DNA and
requires removing just 10 mg of bone
from a specimen rather than much
larger pieces of bone.Of 24 Neandertal
and 40 early modern human fossils
analyzed,they found four Neandertal
and ﬁve early human specimens that
passed the amino acid test.These fossils
included samples classiﬁed as
“transitional”between the two
groups and represented a wide
distribution across Europe,
where the two groups would
likely have encountered one
another.When they analyzed
these samples for Neandertal
mtDNA,they found mtDNA
sequences that are absent
in contemporary human
mtDNA genes but quite
similar to those found in the
four previously sequenced
Neandertals.They found no
Neandertal-like mtDNA in the
early human samples.
While the authors explain
that it’s impossible to
deﬁnitively conclude that no
genetic ﬂow occurred between
early humans and Neandertals given the
limited number of early human fossils
available,they point out that even fossil
samples considered as anatomically
transitional between modern humans
and Neandertals failed to show evidence
of mtDNA exchange.Thus,Pääbo
and colleagues conclude,while it’s
possible that Neandertals made a small
contribution to the genetic makeup of
contemporary humans,the evidence
cannot support the possibility of a large
contribution.

Over the course of evolution,some
organisms have gained many genes
and become increasingly complex
whereas other,simpler,organisms have
survived with comparatively fewer genes.
(Compare,for example,the 30,000 genes
of humans to the 5,500 of brewer’s
yeast.) But where do these“new”genes
come from? Evolutionary biologists have
long known that duplication of existing
genes is an important source of genetic
novelty—it is easier to
copy and modify an
existing gene than to
create a completely
new one from scratch.
Because gene
duplication makes
such a major
contribution to
evolution,researchers
have attempted
to understand the
mechanisms of
gene duplication,
how genes evolve
once they become
duplicated,and what functional effect
gene duplications have for the organism.
Recent genomic studies,for example,
appear to show that most duplicated
genes go through a period of accelerated
evolution and also that the presence of
duplicated genes adds robustness to
the functioning of genomes.In research
published in this issue,however,Jerel
Davis and Dmitri Petrov look at gene
duplication from a different perspective.
Rather than asking how genes are
duplicated,they asked which genes
tend to be“good”at duplicating over
the course of evolution.The answer is
important for our understanding of
the forces underlying gene duplication
and will also help us understand why
genomes contain duplicates of some
genes and not others.
The authors began by identifying
duplicated and nonduplicated gene pairs
in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
and the worm Caenorhabditis elegans,
two model organisms whose genomes
have been sequenced.They then looked
for the corresponding genes in two
distantly related species,the fruitﬂy
and the mosquito,in order to obtain an
independent measure of evolutionary
rate.This independent measure is vital
Conserved Genes Preferentially Duplicated in Evolution
because of the likelihood that gene
duplication itself inﬂuences the rate of
evolution.After obtaining these rates,the
researchers compared the evolutionary
rates of duplicated and nonduplicated
genes.
Stated simply,the authors found that
slowly evolving (that is,more conserved)
genes are more successful at generating
duplicates than faster evolving genes.
This is no recent trend—more conserved
genes have been
better at generating
duplicates of
themselves
consistently over
hundreds of million
of years.
This research
challenges the
assumption that
genes are duplicated
in an unbiased
manner.In addition,
it provides the
essential background
for other genomic
studies of gene duplication.For example,
the acceleration of protein evolution
upon duplication is likely to be even
more dramatic considering that it is the
slowly evolving genes that duplicate
preferentially.
These ﬁndings also open up
new questions in the study of gene
duplication.The authors convincingly
demonstrate the bias toward conserved
genes in the process of duplication,but
how and why does this happen? For
a duplicated gene to be retained in a
species,the duplicate must be ﬁxed in the
population and then must be preserved
by natural selection.The preferential
duplication of slowly evolving genes
might come from a bias in either of these
steps,and the authors outline several
models for why this might be the case.
Further analysis may enable researchers
to test these and other models for
gene duplication—especially as more
sequence data become available—
and learn more about this potent
phenomenon in genome evolution.

Phylogenetic studies show that slowly
evolving genes are more likely to be
duplicated than faster evolving genes
Wolbachia have a thing against males.
A member of one of the most diverse
groups of bacteria,called Proteobacteria,
this parasitic“endosymbiont”lives
inside the reproductive cells of a wide
variety of the nearly 1 million species of
arthropods,including insects,spiders,
and crustaceans.It has also been found
in worms.Wolbachia’s preferred habitat
is the cytoplasm of its host’s gametes.
Since sperm have very little cytoplasm,
Wolbachia seek out the company
of females,securing its survival by
hitching a ride to the next generation
in the cytoplasm of the mother’s eggs.
Wolbachia’s effects range from beneﬁcial
to pathological,depending on which
species infects which invertebrate host,
but since most species are not beneﬁcial,
Wolbachia infections often turn out
badly if the host is male.On the other
hand,if female,the host could very
well live longer,produce more eggs,
and have higher hatching rates than its
noninfected cousins—thereby facilitating
Wolbachia’s transmission from mother to
offspring.
Wolbachia have evolved an
impressive repertoire of“reproductive
parasitic”strategies to adapt its host’s
physiology to its own advantage.One
strategy involves inducing“cytoplasmic
incompatibility”between sperm and egg,
which in effect uses infected males to
keep uninfected females from producing
viable offspring.Another causes infected
females to reproduce asexually,creating
a new generation of infected clones.
Another turns developing male embryos
into females.And,in a pinch,some
Wolbachia simply kill developing males.
The biochemical mechanisms that trigger
different strategies in different hosts
are unclear,however,in part because
it’s so far been impossible to cultivate
sufﬁcient quantities of these obligate
endosymbionts (that is,intracellular
species that cannot survive outside
their host).But now that Scott O’Neill,
Jonathan Eisen,and colleagues have
sequenced the complete genome of one
strain of Wolbachia pipientis,scientists
investigating the biology and evolution
of Wolbachia–host interactions have a
valuable new research tool.The strain
they sequenced,W.pipientis wMel,
Genome Sequence

Bacterium Wolbachia
March 2004 | Volume 2 | Issue 3 | Page 0287PLoS Biology | http://biology.plosjournals.org
lives inside the fruitﬂy Drosophila
melanogaster,the favorite model
organism of geneticists for nearly 100
years.This strain causes cytoplasmic
incompatibility in its host.
The structure of the wMel genome,
the O’Neill and Eisen groups note,is
strikingly different from any other
obligate intracellular species.While
its genome is compact,it nonetheless
contains large amounts of repetitive
DNA and“mobile”DNA elements.Mobile
genetic elements,as the name implies,
are DNA sequences that move around
the genome and are often acquired from
other species.Most of the repetitive and
mobile elements in Wolbachia do not
appear in other α-Proteobacteria species
and were probably introduced some
time after Wolbachia split off from its
evolutionary ancestors.Wolbachia,unlike
other obligate intracellular bacteria,seem
quite amenable to incorporating foreign
DNA,which the authors speculate was
introduced by the bacteria-infecting virus
called phage.
Analysis of the Wolbachia genome
sheds light on the mechanisms that
might help the parasite manipulate
the host cell’s physiology to its own
advantage.One likely bacterial weapon
for host exploitation is the abundance
of predicted genes encoding ankyrin
repeat domains,amino acid sequences
characteristic of proteins important
for protein–protein interactions in
eukaryotes (organisms with nuclei,which
bacteria lack).In bacteria,ankyrin repeats
might regulate host cell-cycle pathways,
which one wasp-infecting Wolbachia
strain modiﬁes to induce cytoplasmic
incompatibility.Other molecular
interactions between wMel and its host,
the researchers propose,might also rely
on proteins with these ankyrin repeats.
The Wolbachia genome also provides
insight into mitochondrial evolution.It is
widely believed that these intracellular
energy-metabolizing centers were
once free-living bacteria belonging to
the α-Proteobacteria group,though
it’s not clear which branch of the
α-Proteobacteria tree they inhabit.
Complete genome analysis of various
α-Proteobacteria—including wMel,the
ﬁrst non-Rickettsia species sequenced
in the Rickettsiales group—provides
no evidence that mitochondria are
more related to Rickettsia species
than to Wolbachia,as was previously
thought.In fact,further analysis failed to
consistently connect mitochondria to any
particular species or group within the
α-Proteobacteria.
While the information hidden in
the Wolbachia genome seems to raise
as many issues as it settles,biologists
studying a wide range of problems—
from the evolution and biology
of Wolbachia and endosymbiont–
host interactions to the origin of
mitochondria—have a valuable new
tool to explore their questions.The
Wolbachia genome will also provide
important molecular guidance for efforts
to suppress insect pests and control
ﬁlariasis,a human disease caused by
worms.Since beneﬁcial Wolbachia live
in both insect and worm,applying
antibiotics to target the Wolbachia
will ultimately kill the insect pest and
infecting worm,which both depend on
the bacteria to survive.

mRNA Targets of RNA-Binding Proteins Suggest an Extensive System
for Post-Transcriptional Regulation
The single-celled Saccharomyces
cerevisiae,commonly known as baker’s
yeast,measures just 2 microns—it takes
about 4 billion to ﬁll a teaspoon.But
as a eukaryote (its cells have nuclei),its
genes function in much the same way
a human’s do.For a gene to function,its
DNA sequence must ﬁrst be transcribed
into RNA (called messenger RNA,or
mRNA),whose sequence can then be
translated into a speciﬁc string of amino
acids to form the unique protein that the
gene encodes.
The population of mRNA transcripts
in each cell (its“transcriptome”)
is dynamic—the genome uses its
vocabulary of genes to write an ever-
evolving script for the cell as its life
unfolds and its environment changes.By
binding to speciﬁc sequences of DNA,
proteins called transcription factors
process signals from the cell’s sensory
and information-processing systems
to control which genes are transcribed
in each cell,under what conditions,
and at what rate.While the steps and
regulatory programs that govern gene
expression at this level are reasonably
well known,much less is known about
the orchestration of the later steps in the
gene expression program—where in the
cell each mRNA molecule goes when
it leaves the nucleus,at what rate and
under what conditions it is translated into
protein,and how long it survives.
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have
been implicated in diverse aspects of
post-transcriptional gene regulation.
Hundreds of RBPs are encoded in the
eukaryotic genome,but because few
have been studied in detail and few
of their mRNA targets are known,the
nature and extent of an RBP-mediated
post-transcriptional program has been
obscure.Now a systemic analysis of a
speciﬁc family of RBPs and their mRNACluster of RNA targets for Puf proteins

To function properly,cells must keep constant tabs on the
environmental conditions around them,such as the presence of
growth hormones in the blood or the proximity
of neighboring cells.These
external cues are relayed into
the cell through a cascade
of chemical and physical
reactions referred to as
signal transduction.Signal
transduction pathways
inform and regulate almost
all activity within the cell,from
protein production to cell
division.Understanding these
processes is fundamental
to biology,but the sheer
number of molecules and
interactions in some pathways
makes thorough documentation
difﬁcult.
Taking a holistic approach that
combines both computational
models and experimental
manipulations,scientists
have described the web of
interactions involved in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)
signal transduction pathway.AHR belongs to the Per–Arnt–Sim
(PAS) superfamily of sensor molecules that regulate functions
like development,the sleep-wake cycle,and cellular reaction to
oxygen deprivation.Unlike many receptors that are embedded
in the cell membrane,AHR ﬂoats freely in the main body of
the cell,called the cytosol.There it waits for a stimulus or
A Holistic Approach to Evaluating Cellular Communication Pathways
ligand,such as a dioxin molecule,to enter the cell and bind to
it.Once bound,AHR undergoes a host of changes,glomming
on to additional molecules before it enters the cell nucleus
and acts as a transcription factor,initiating the production of
enzymes to digest foreign,or xenobiotic,compounds.
The AHR pathway is a curiosity; though found in all
vertebrates,the natural,or endogenous,ligand
remains unknown.Without this knowledge,
researchers are limited in the kind
of experiments they can perform to
evaluate the pathway.
Christopher Bradﬁeld and
colleagues used yeast as a
model system to elucidate
the steps involved in this
pathway,which regulates
vertebrate cell response to
pollutants like dioxins.To ﬁrst
assess the molecules involved in
the AHR pathway,the team used
4,507 yeast“deletion”strains,
each strain missing one gene from
its genome.They then inserted the AHR
gene into the strains using small rings of
movable DNA called plasmids.Though
yeast does not naturally possess AHR,it is an ideal genetic model
for studying signaling pathways due to its quick generation time,
small,well-characterized genome,and similarity to vertebrate
systems.
Bradﬁeld’s team exposed each strain to a receptor stimulus
or agonist and screened them for AHR response.If a deletion
strain showed signiﬁcantly reduced activity,they concluded that
Protein-interactive-network for AHR signaling
targets in yeast by André Gerber,Daniel
Herschlag,and Patrick Brown,of Stanford
University,suggests that such a program
may exert detailed control over the life
history of every mRNA.By selectively
binding and regulating speciﬁc classes of
mRNAs,RBPs may provide a mechanism
to coordinate the collective fate of these
transcripts and serve as an integral part
of the global transcriptome.
Gerber,Herschlag,and Brown focused
on the binding targets of a family of
RBPs called Pumilio-Fbf (Puf) proteins,
which are deﬁned by the presence
and conﬁguration of an amino acid
domain that mediates RNA-binding.
Little is known about the physiological
function of the ﬁve yeast Puf proteins
the researchers studied here (called
Puf1p-Puf5p).After using“afﬁnity tags”to
snag each of the ﬁve Puf proteins from
yeast cells,together with their bound
mRNA targets,the researchers identiﬁed
the associated mRNAs with microarray
analysis.They found more than 700
mRNAs bound by at least one Puf protein,
with each Puf RBP targeting a distinct
group of mRNAs.The group of mRNAs
associated with each Puf protein turned
out to encode proteins with strikingly
similar functions and locations in the cell.
Many of the mRNA sets encode proteins
that reside in the same cellular location,
are part of the same protein complexes,
or act in the same signaling pathway.
Some Puf proteins target mRNAs that
encode membrane proteins while others
preferentially bind to mRNAs that encode
proteins involved in cell division.The
most pronounced bias occurs with Puf3p,
which overwhelmingly binds mRNAs
that encode proteins destined for the
mitochondria,the cell’s power generators.
This selective tagging of functionally
related mRNAs by speciﬁc RBPs suggests
a mechanism for coordinated global
control of gene expression at the post-
transcriptional level.Just as transcription
factors regulate transcription by binding
to speciﬁc DNA sequences,RBPs may
mediate regulation of the subcellular
localization,translation,and degradation
of the set of speciﬁc mRNAs they target.
Noting the striking themes in the
subcellular localization of the proteins
encoded by the mRNAs bound by each
Puf protein,Gerber,Herschlag,and Brown
propose that RBPs may play important
roles in the subcellular localization
and efﬁcient assembly of protein
complexes and functional systems by
ensuring that the location in the cell
at which mRNAs are translated“is not
left to chance.”Since the number of
RBPs encoded in eukaryotic genomes
approaches that of transcription
factors,the regulatory program that
controls the post-transcriptional fate of
mRNAs—their localization,translation,
and survival—may prove to be nearly as
diverse and complex as the regulation of
transcription itself.

the missing gene was a key component
to the signal pathway.The researchers
identiﬁed 54 genes that had a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on AHR response.Only two of
these genes,termed modiﬁers,had been
previously identiﬁed.
Signaling pathways usually boil down
to a series of discrete steps.To identify
steps of the AHR pathway,the researchers
constructed a spider web-like map called
a“protein interaction network,”or PIN,
based on previously known interactions
between the proteins encoded by the
54 modiﬁer genes.The resulting map
revealed groups of highly connected,
related modiﬁers,which the authors
proposed to be steps in the pathway.
Though other studies have used the
newly developed PIN strategy to
investigate cellular processes,Bradﬁeld’s
team also annotated their PIN through a
series of experiments both to support the
identity of and to better understand the
protein groups,referred to as functional
modules.
With tests based on discrete receptor
signaling events,known active structural
regions,reaction to different types
and concentrations of agonists,and
functional location within the cell,
Bradﬁeld’s team organized the functional
modules into ﬁve steps.One group of
modiﬁers is involved in AHR folding,the
conformational change that occurs when
the receptor binds to a toxin.With the
help of other modiﬁers,the new AHR
complex is then translocated into the
cell nucleus.Once in the nucleus,a series
of modiﬁers assist the AHR in its role as
a transcription factor.The researchers
also identiﬁed a step in the pathway that
controls production of AHR itself and
another unknown“step”that takes place
inside the nucleus.
As AHR is thought to be a prototype
PAS receptor,understanding the steps
in this pathway will likely guide future
research on the entire family,allowing
scientists to study in detail individual
steps in these complex pathways.The
highly integrated method reported here
could also be used to study most other
mammalian signaling pathways,giving
scientists a new tool as they attempt to
understand how cells respond to their
changing environment.

Tracking Blood-Forming Stem Cells through Development
Of the 200-plus different types
of cells that form the mammalian
body,most have a ﬁnite life span.Like
nearly everything in biology,there are
exceptions—neurons and muscle cells,
for example,can last a lifetime—but the
vast majority of cells eventually wear out
and must be replaced.Among the most
short-lived cells,blood cells are generated
continuously,mainly in the bone marrow
of an adult,recharging the bloodstream as
their depleted predecessors are efﬁciently
dispatched and removed from circulation
every 120 days.Some 2.5 million new red
blood cells are generated every second
from a small pool of stem cells.
Blood cell development,called
hematopoiesis,passes through discrete
stages in speciﬁc tissues in the developing
embryo before converging in the bone
marrow,where it continues throughout
adulthood.Some researchers have
proposed that hematopoietic stem cells
(HSC) ﬂood the bloodstream during
short,precise intervals to build the
developing hematopoietic system (which
includes the liver,bone marrow,spleen,
tonsils,and lymph nodes).Presenting an
alternative model for HSC migration,Julie
Christensen and her colleagues in Irving
Weissman’s lab at Stanford University
report that HSC in mice gradually leave
the fetal liver to colonize the developing
spleen and bone marrow as the organs
acquire the means to support them.
In mouse embryos,HSC precursors
develop ﬁrst in the yolk sac and a region
called the aorta-gonad-mesonephros
(AGM),then they migrate to the liver,and
later to the spleen,before ﬁnally settling
into the bone marrow just before birth.
It was thought that this migration occurs
in distinct waves of HSC production
because HSC numbers decrease in one
region just before increasing in newly
forming hematopoietic sites.Analyzing
the concentration and activity of HSC,
Christensen et al.found the cells in the
blood at low but fairly constant levels
during much of late fetal development,
when they migrate from the liver to the
spleen and bone marrow.Although the
HSC population decreases in the liver at
15.5 days after conception,the authors
propose that this drop occurs primarily
because the HSC have differentiated
into mature blood cells,not because
they’ve exited the liver en masse to help
build the spleen and bone marrow.On
the other hand,the slight decrease in
circulating HSC,which also occurs around
this time,may be attributed to their
recruitment from the bloodstream to
these developing tissues.
Christensen et al.also examined the
impact of intercellular
signaling proteins
called chemokines,
which help regulate
fundamental
developmental
processes,on
HSC migration.To
effectively“seed”
developing tissues,
HSC must ﬁrst be
recruited from the blood,guided to the
appropriate nascent tissue,then corralled
and sustained.The chemokine SDF-1
attracts and retains HSC in the bone
marrow but was thought to have a lesser
effect on fetal liver HSC.Christensen et
al.demonstrate not only that liver HSC
migrate in response to this chemokine,
but that their migratory response
increases dramatically when both SDF-1
and a signaling protein called steel factor
(SLF) are present.While adult marrow HSC
respond to SDF-1,they do not respond
to SLF alone and do not show improved
migration in the presence of both SLF and
SDF-1.
Bone marrow transplants have become
increasingly common for a number
of hematological disorders,including
leukemia and aplastic anemia.Since
hematopoiesis occurs primarily in the
bone marrow in both mice and humans
after birth,these ﬁndings offer valuable
insights into the migratory behavior of
these stem cells and suggest how HSC
migration might be applied to bone
marrow transplants and other clinical
therapies.

Trace heavy metals are essential for a
number of metabolic reactions in living
systems,but cells walk a ﬁne line between
feast or famine.While iron,zinc,cobalt,
and manganese,for example,contribute
to the catabolic activity of enzymes
involved in essential pathways from gene
regulation to cell signaling,even a mild
surplus of these metals
can kill cells and cause
a variety of diseases.
Maintaining the
proper concentration,
or homeostasis,of
cellular metals requires
strict policing of
what passes through
cell membranes and
organelles.
One way cells
regulate entry
is through the
hydrophobic lipid
(fatty) layer that
makes up the cell
membrane.While the
lipid membrane allows
most small fat-soluble or
uncharged molecules to
simply diffuse through
it,nearly all water-soluble molecules,
including metal compounds—which
typically break down into ions (molecules
with positive or negative charge) in
solution—rely on either transport or
channel proteins to get through.
Two types of proteins manage the
transport and uptake of iron ions
in mammalian cells:the transferrin
receptor helps to concentrate iron in
discrete intracellular compartments
called endosomes,while a protein called
divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1)
releases iron into the cytoplasm,where it
supports essential metabolic processes.
DMT1 also serves to bring dietary iron
directly into the intestinal cells involved
in iron absorption.DMT1 preferentially
carries iron,zinc,copper,and manganese,
but not calcium.This selectivity
helps strike the right balance of the
concentration of these metals in the cell.
Recent structural analyses of transporters,
however,have raised the possibility that
this selectivity may not be as ﬁxed as
once thought.Lending support to the
notion that the distinctions between
transporters and ion channels are
blurring,David Clapham,Nancy Andrews,
and colleagues report that a mutation
causing a single amino acid substitution
in the DMT1 metal ion transporter
opens a passageway that converts the
transporter into a calcium channel.
DMT1 is essential for maintaining
iron homeostasis and the only molecule
known to facilitate transmembrane iron
uptake in higher eukaryotes,including
humans.It is expressed mainly in
epithelial cells of the small intestine,
where iron metabolism is monitored,and
in endosomes,which release transferrin-
imported iron.The Clapham and Andrews
groups focused on a mutation in the
DMT1 transporter called G185R—which
substitutes the arginine (R) amino acid
for glycine (G) at a particular location in
the protein’s amino acid chain,position
185—because the identical mutation has
occurred spontaneously in three separate
laboratory strains of rodents (two
mouse and one rat strain).That a single
substitution has arisen independently
and persisted in multiple rodent
generations suggests it may confer some
type of selective advantage.
To investigate this idea,the researchers
compared the properties of“wild-type”
(nonmutant) DMT1 and mutant G185R in
laboratory cell lines.They found that cells
expressing G185R mutant proteins had
much lower levels of iron uptake than
cells expressing the nonmutant proteins,
but that they also permitted the inﬂux of
calcium ions.To see whether the G185R-
mediated calcium permeability had a
physiological effect on the mice with this
mutation,the researchers compared the
properties of intestinal epithelial cells
taken from the mutant and nonmutant
animals.The intestinal cells in the mutant
mice showed high levels of the G185R
protein and a large current of charged
molecules—much as would occur in
an ion channel.This
current was observed
in both the cell lines
expressing G185R and
the cells extracted
from the G185R
mutant mice.
The G185R
mutation,the
researchers conclude,
appears to either
expose or enhance a
calcium“permeation
pathway”that exhibits
the properties of
a calcium channel.
This transformation
appears to offer a
selective advantage,
since mice engineered
without the DMT1
protein die within a week
of birth while mice born with the G185R
DMT1 mutation can live for over a year.
Though the G185R mice exhibit severe
iron deﬁciency,the modest function
retained by G185R in combination with
the increased inﬂux of calcium may
be enough to extend their lifespan.
The increased levels of calcium,the
researchers propose,may support iron
uptake through some other pathway,an
advantage that might explain why such a
mutation would persist.
Whatever mechanism accounts for
this advantage,the G185R mutation
transforms DMT1 transporter into an
“unambiguous”calcium ion channel.
Investigating the structural and
biochemical properties of this molecular
changeling will provide valuable
insights into the emerging model of a
transporter–channel continuum—which
suggests a remarkable adaptability to
shifting environmental conditions.

The notion of a neurally encoded“reward system”that
reinforces pleasure-seeking behaviors ﬁrst emerged ﬁfty years
ago.Psychologists James Olds and Peter Milner discovered
this phenomenon when their“lack of aim”landed an electrode
outside their target while studying the behavioral responses
of rats given electrical stimulation to a particular brain
region.It was known that stimulation of certain brain regions
would induce an animal to avoid the behavior that produced
the stimulus.But in the rat with the“misplaced”electrode,
stimulation of this new region caused the rat to repeat the
behavior that caused the stimulus.Stimulation of certain brain
regions provides a very strong incentive to restimulate,creating
a feedback loop that reinforces both the behavior and the
neural response to it.
When gentle shocks
were delivered to the
rat hypothalamus,for
example,the animals
would“self-stimulate”
2,000 times per hour
by pushing a lever.
The neurotransmitter
dopamine,it was later
discovered,plays an
important role in the
brain’s reward system—
and in laying the
biochemical foundation
of drug addiction.
Essential for normal
central nervous system
function,dopamine
signaling mediates physiological functions as diverse as
movement and lactation.The dopamine transporter (DAT) is
involved in terminating dopamine signaling by removing the
dopamine chemical messenger molecules from nerve synapses
and returning them into the releasing neurons (a process called
reuptake).DAT can also bind amphetamine,cocaine,and other
psychostimulants,which inhibit dopamine reuptake,and,in the
case of amphetamine,also stimulate the release of dopamine
through DAT.It’s thought that abnormal concentrations of
dopamine in synapses initiate a series of events that cause
the behavioral effects of these drugs.The biochemical steps
underlying amphetamine-induced dopamine release,however,
are not well characterized.Now,a team led by Jonathan Javitch
and Aurelio Galli has identiﬁed a chemical modiﬁcation of
DAT that is essential for DAT-mediated dopamine release in
the presence of amphetamine.Since this modiﬁcation does
not inhibit the ability of DAT to accumulate dopamine,it may
suggest a molecular target for treating drug addiction.
Embedded in the membrane of nerve cells,the dopamine
transporter has a“tail,”called the N-terminal domain,that
protrudes into the cell interior and consists of a stretch of about
60 amino acids.Many of these amino acids are potential sites
of phosphorylation,a chemical reaction in which a phosphate
group is added through the action of enzymes called kinases.
Amphetamine has been shown to increase kinase activity
and Margaret Gnegy,a coauthor of the current research
article,showed previously that inhibiting protein kinase C
activity blocks amphetamine’s ability to release dopamine.
Therefore,Javitch,Galli,and Gnegy hypothesized that N-
terminal phosphorylation of DAT might play a critical role in the
dopamine overload caused by amphetamine.
The researchers found that amphetamine-induced dopamine
release was reduced by 80% in cells expressing a mutant
dopamine transporter in which the ﬁrst 22 amino acids of the
N-terminal domain had
been removed (del-
22).Surprisingly,this
truncated transporter
displayed normal
dopamine uptake.
In a full-length DAT,
mutation of the ﬁve
N-terminal serine amino
acids to alanine amino
acids,which prevented
phosphorylation,
produced an effect
similar to removing
the 22 amino acids.In
contrast,replacing these
ﬁve serine residues with
aspartate residues to
mimic phosphorylation
led to normal dopamine release as well as normal dopamine
uptake.
These ﬁndings suggest that phosphorylation of one or
more of these serine residues is necessary for amphetamine
to ﬂood the synapses with dopamine.While phosphorylation
is a normal mechanism for regulating protein activity in a
cell—and DAT is “signiﬁcantly phosphorylated”under normal
conditions—amphetamine could increase the level of DAT
phosphorylation.Elucidating the mechanisms through which
phosphorylation of DAT’s N-terminus facilitates dopamine
overload could lead to the development of drugs that block
the“rewarding”effects of amphetamines and other addictive
psychostimulants without interfering with normal dopamine
clearance.

A Mechanism for Amphetamine-Induced Dopamine Overload
Measuring changes in dopamine transport

The brain is an overwhelmingly complex organ packed with
billions of nerve cells,performing a myriad of different functions.
To decipher the roles of individual neurons in processing
sensation or actions,scientists can measure the neural activity
of animals that are shown particular objects or perform simple
tasks.In this way,neurons are categorized as having preferences,
also known as selective responses.These techniques have been
particularly helpful in determining,or mapping,preferences of
visual areas in the cerebral cortex.For example,some neurons
respond to the color of an object,while others respond to the
direction that object is moving.What is less well understood,
however,is how the brain integrates information from individual
neurons for complex processes such as perception and behavior.
That is,how does neural activity affect what we see and do?
Microstimulation,a technique that activates a cluster of nerve
cells by zapping them with a weak electrical current,has helped
make causal links between neurons and behavior.For instance,
when neurons in an area of the visual cortex that are“tuned”to
a particular direction of motion are microstimulated,the way
monkeys perceive moving dots on a video screen changes.
Microstimulation seems to change what they see.Similar work
has also been done for neurons that respond to binocular
disparity—the depth-of-ﬁeld information you gain because each
eye has a slightly different view of the world.
But many neurons respond,or are tuned,to more than one
dimension,leading scientists to wonder how information from
these multidimensional neurons contributes to perception—
especially when some of that information is irrelevant to a
given task.As they report in this issue,Gregory DeAngelis and
William Newsome ﬁnd that neurons tuned to both direction and
binocular disparity contribute little to monkeys’perception of
motion.
The researchers asked three rhesus monkeys to determine
the direction a group of dots was moving on a TV screen—a
task that can be done regardless of the perceived depth of the
dots.The authors had already located two different types of
neurons in each of the monkey’s brains:sites tuned strongly to
direction and multidimensional sites tuned to both direction
and binocular disparity.They then determined each site’s exact
preference:the direction of motion and degree of binocular
disparity (if present) that triggered maximum neural activity.
The researchers then showed the monkeys several sets of video
displays,some with the dots moving in the“preferred”direction
and some not.The microstimulation acts somewhat like adding
dots in the preferred direction—which confuses monkeys when
the real dots are moving against preference and aids them
in trials of preferred moving dots.If the behavioral effect of
microstimulation—whether it be a help or a hindrance—was
signiﬁcant,it meant that the monkeys were monitoring the
activated neurons to perform the task at hand; if there was no
change,the stimulated neurons were not being recruited.
DeAngelis and Newsome hypothesized that multidimensional
neurons (which are also tuned to the irrelevant dimension
of binocular disparity) might be ignored during pure motion
perception tasks.For two of the three monkeys,this was true.
Microstimulation of multidimensional sites had no effect on their
behavior,compared to the signiﬁcant effect of microstimulation
of direction-only sites.But for the third monkey,called monkey
R,microstimulation of both types of sites had signiﬁcant effects
on his performance.He didn’t seem to be ignoring anything.The
authors proposed that the monkeys could be using different
neural strategies to complete the same task.This conclusion
is supported by the fact that monkey R performed better on
the task than the other monkeys; he appeared to be recruiting
any neuron with applicable information,unlike the others,who
seemed to rely on neurons tuned solely to direction of motion.
Furthermore,for the few multidimensional sites that affected
behavior,their contribution was tempered by how well the
depth,or disparity,of the video matched the preference of the
stimulated neurons.
The results of this paper show that even if neurons carry
information that can aid in perceptual decision making,they
may not participate,depending on how they are tuned along
other (irrelevant) stimulus dimensions.All directional neurons
are not created equal—some are more useful than others for
a particular task.Whether neurons that respond to a particular
stimulus contribute to the task at hand depends on how
closely that stimulus hews to the neurons’preference as well
as on the subject’s learned strategy for performing the task.
This neural ﬂexibility,the authors point out,suggests that the
brain uses complex,variable strategies to respond to changing
environmental stimuli.Techniques like microstimulation will be
helpful in drawing the connections between neural activity and
behavior.
