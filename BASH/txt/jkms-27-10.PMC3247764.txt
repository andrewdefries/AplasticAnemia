Real-Time Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification to Predict
the Clinical Outcome of Invasive Aspergillosis
Monitoring the response to therapy for invasive aspergillosis (IA) is essential for the
management of patients with hematologic diseases. We evaluated the correlation between
the outcome of real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (RTi-NASBA) for
Aspergillus 18S rRNA and the clinical outcome of IA. A total of 157 serum samples from
29 patients with IA were tested for RTi-NASBA. The treatment response and mortality were
compared with the NASBA outcome (whether the NASBA value was converted to negative
or not) at 12 weeks after the start of antifungal therapy. At 12 weeks, there was a
moderate correlation between the treatment failure and persistently positive NASBA
(κ = 0.482; P = 0.019). Deaths attributable to IA were more prevalent in patients without
negative conversion of NASBA than in those with negative conversion (50% vs 5%;
P = 0.013). Significant factors of treatment failure at 12 weeks were the status of
hematologic disease (nonremission; P = 0.041) and the NASBA outcome (failure of
negative conversion; P = 0.024). Survival was significantly better in patients with negative
conversion of NASBA than those with persistently positive values (P = 0.036). This study
suggests that the serial monitoring of RTi-NASBA could be useful for prediction of the
clinical outcome in hematologic patients with IA.

INTRODUCTION
Aspergillus is the most common filamentous fungal pathogen
in febrile neutropenic patients with hematologic diseases or in
recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
(1, 2). In these patients, invasive aspergillosis (IA) has contrib-
uted to high morbidity and mortality rates despite current avail-
ability of new antifungal agents (3, 4).
  Diagnostic techniques, based on detection of either the anti-
gen (e.g. serum galactomannan by enzyme immunosorbent as-
say [GM-EIA] and (1→3)-β-D-glucan assay) or the nucleic acid
(e.g. PCR), could be used for early detection of the Aspergillus
species. However, false-negative results of GM-EIA have been
reported in patients with exposure to a mold-active antifungal
agent (5, 6). It has also been demonstrated that high-resolution
computed tomography also plays a limited role, particularly
during the early period of antifungal therapy(7,8).Therefore,we
need another proper surrogate marker to monitor the therapeu-
tic response and to predict the clinical outcome of IA.
  Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) was de-
veloped as a diagnostic method to detect target mRNA in an iso-
thermal amplification process. Unlike PCR to detect DNA, the
detection of mRNA means the presence of viable fungal organ-
isms and highly-expressed genes can be used to assess the via-
bility of the infecting fungal organisms following antifungal ther-
apy (9). Also, an isothermal process could have less chance of
contamination than the PCR process using thermal cycling. We
have devised real-time NASBA (RTi-NASBA) using molecular
beacon and applied this technique for the diagnosis of IA in pa-
tients with febrile neutropenia (10-12). Recently, we have tried
a new paradigm of RTi-NASBA on the platform of the LightCy-
cler 480 system (13). However, there has been little knowledge
about the practical usefulness of NASBA for evaluation of the
treatment response to antifungal therapy in patients suffering
from IA.
  In this study, we investigated the role of RTi-NASBA for Asper-
gillus spp. as a predictor of the treatment response and clinical
outcome of IA in patients with hematologic disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

the revised definitions of the invasive fungal disease published
by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of
Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses
StudyGroupConsensusGroup(14).Finally,weenrolledthepa-
tients with at least 3 serial, available serum specimens to moni-
tor the results of RTi-NASBA for the Aspergillus spp. during the
period at risk for IA. Serum samples were usually obtained at 3
to 7-day intervals and stored at -70°C immediately after the col-
lections. Patients under 15 yr of age were excluded.
  Patients with prolonged neutropenia (absolute neutrophil
countof < 500/μLfor > 10days)receivedantimicrobialprophy-
laxis(ciprofloxacin[500mg/day,p.o.]+fluconazole[100mg/day,
p.o.]oritraconazoleoralsolution[5mg/kg/day]).Allpatientswith
neutropenia or other risk factors for IA were routinely screened
twice weekly for GM-EIA (Platelia Aspergillus, Bio-Rad, Marnes-
la-Cocquette, France). GM-EIA value of ≥ 0.5 was regarded as
positive. The empirical antibiotic therapy was administered to
the neutropenic patients at the onset of fever and then modified
promptly according to the Infectious Diseases Society of Amer-
ica guidelines (15). The antifungal therapy was initiated empiri-
cally in patients presenting with persistent neutropenic fever af-
ter 5 days of antibiotic therapy or with any symptoms, signs, ra-
diographic or laboratory evidence of IA. We reviewed the medi-
cal records and collected the following data: demographic data,
underlying disease, symptoms and signs related to IA, radio-
graphic and laboratory findings, and administration of antifun-
gal therapy.
Performance of NASBA
We performed quantitative RTi-NASBA targeting a highly con-
served region of Aspergillus 18S rRNA (verified by clinically rel-
evant Aspergillus spp. [A. fumigatus, A. flavus, A. niger, and A.
terreus]) in serum samples as described in previous studies (10,
11). The sequence of Asp 1.2 (including the T7-promoter se-
quence; underlined) was 5´-AATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAG­
GGGAGCAAAGGCCTGCTTTGAACA-3´, and that of Asp 2.1
was: 5´-GCCGCGGTAATTCCAGCTCCAATA-3´. The sequence
of molecular beacon was 5´-FAM-CGATCGGGTCCGCCTCAC­
CGCGAGTACTGCGATCG-DABCYL-3´. NASBA was primarily
performed using the Nuclisense Basic Kit (BioMérieux Korea,
Seoul, Korea) and monitored in real-time with the LightCycler
480 system (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The cut-off value of
NASBA was determined at 1.571 times the mean of thenegative
controlvaluesasdescribedpreviously(13).Thetime to positivity
(TTP) was defined as the time at which the target and internal
controlamplificationcurvespassedthecut-offvalues.RNAcop-
ies of Aspergillus spp. were calculated from the following regres-
sion equation (16):
  TTP = -2.2415 × Ln(copies) + 61.534
Outcome definitions
The study patients were divided into 2 groups based on the
NASBA outcome, namely “NASBA success” and “NASBA fail-
ure”. The NASBA outcome was determined as one of the follow-
ing four patterns: overall negative, maintenance of negative con-
version, rebounding after transient negative, and persistently
positive. Of these four, the first and the second patterns were
defined as “NASBA success”, while the third and the fourth pat-
terns were assigned as “NASBA failure”. The treatment response
and mortality were assessed at 12 weeks after the start of sys-
temic antifungal therapy. The treatment response was catego-
rized into 4 groups according to clinical, radiological, and my-
cological criteria as follows: complete, partial, stable response,
and progression of fungal disease (17). Among these categories,
the complete and partial responses were defined as “treatment
success” and the other two as “treatment failure”. Death during
the study period was considered as “failure”, regardless of attri-
bution. Death from an apparent primary cause unrelated to IA
was excluded from the mortality rate attributable to IA. The fol-
low-up duration was calculated from the start date of systemic
antifungal therapy to the date of the last follow-up or until death
from any cause.
Statistical analysis
CategoricalvariableswerecomparedusingtheFisher’sexacttest.
ThecorrelationbetweentheNASBAoutcomeandthetreatment
response was measured using the kappa coefficient (κ). The sta-
tistical concordance was interpreted as follows: κ ≤ 0.2 was con-
sidered as slight, 0.2 < κ ≤ 0.4 as fair, 0.4 < κ ≤ 0.6 as moderate,
0.6 < κ ≤ 0.8assubstantialandκ > 0.8asalmostperfect(18).Cox
regression analysis was performed to assess the predictive value
of NASBA for treatment failure at 12 weeks. The cumulative sur-
vival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-
ranktestwasusedtocomparethedifferencebetweentheNASBA
successandfailuregroups.Thetwo-sidedP valuesof < 0.05were
considered statistically significant.

patients. The first-line antifungal agent consisted of amphoteri-
cin B deoxycholate (n = 22), intravenous itraconazole (n = 5), or
liposomalamphotericinB(n = 2).Themediandurationofintra-
venous and total antifungal therapy was 20 days (range, 3-102)
and 77 days (range, 19-214), respectively. The median follow-up
duration was 145 days (range, 29-225).
NASBA
A total of 157 serum samples were collected from 29 patients.
The median number of tested samples per patient was 5 (range,
4-9). The overall positivity of NASBA was 27% (42/157). Of 29 pa-
tients, 23 (79%) had at least one positive result of NASBA. Thir-
teen patients (45%) had at least 2 positive results of NASBA and
the median frequency of the positive NASBA was 2 (range, 1-4)
per patient. The Aspergillus RNA titers ranged from 1 to 59,541
copies/mL. The median peak value of NASBA was higher in the
NASBA failure group (2,303 copies/mL [range, 7-45,959]) than
in the NASBA success group (91 copies/mL [range, 1-59,541];
P = 0.093). The median duration of persistently positive NASBA
was 10 days (range, 1-37) in the NASBA failure group and 7 days
(range,2-23)intheNASBAsuccessgroup,respectively(P = 0.548).
NASBA and clinical outcome
The NASBA outcome was as follows: overall negative (n = 6),
maintenance of negative conversion (n = 15), rebounding after
transient negative (n = 3), and persistently positive (n = 5). As
the final outcome based on the NASBA results, NASBA success
and NASBA failure were 21 and 8, respectively.

relation was found between the NASBA outcome and the treat-
ment response (κ = 0.482; positive predictive value, 63%; nega-
tive predictive value, 86%; P = 0.019). Treatment failure was sig-
nificantly more prevalent in the NASBA failure group than in the
NASBA success group (63% [5/8] vs 14% [3/21]; odds ratio [OR],

who showed treatment failure had died within 12 weeks (Table
3).ThecausesofdeathincludedprogressionofIA(n = 5),refrac-
tory acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (n = 1), massive
hemoptysis related to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (n = 1),
anduncontrolledleukemia(n = 1).Amongthese,refractoryacute
GVHD, massive hemoptysis, and uncontrolled leukemia were
excluded from the cause of death attributed to IA. The mortality
rate attributable to IA was significantly higher in the NASBA fail-
ure group than in the NASBA success group (50% [4/8] vs 5%
[1/21]; OR, 20.0; 95% CI, 1.743-229.492; κ = 0.512).
  In the Cox regression analysis, significant predictors of the
treatment failure at 12 weeks were the status of hematologic dis-
ease (i.e. non-remission) and the NASBA outcome (i.e. NASBA
failure) (Table 4). The median survival duration was 152 days
(95%CI,111-167)intheNASBAsuccessgroupand69days(95%
CI, 41-144) in the NASBA failure group, respectively. The surviv-
al rate of patients in the NASBA success group was significantly
higher than that in the NASBA failure group (Fig. 1).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated whether the serial monitoring of
RTi-NASBA could predict the treatment response and clinical
outcome of IA in patients with hematologic diseases. There is a
lack of the sensitivity of culture for Aspergillus spp. from clinical
specimens (19). If Aspergillus is isolated from infected tissue, the

procedure may not be feasible in immunocompromised pa-
tients. Furthermore, CFU counting may not accurately estimate
the burden of filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus spp., be-
cause of their characteristic growth patterns (20). Several inves-
tigatorshaveattemptedtomeasurethefungalburdenusingnon-
culture-based methods for Aspergillus spp. It has been shown
that GM-EIA, (1→3)-β-D-glucan, quantitative PCR, and NASBA
were available alternatives to the quantitative culture (21-24).
Recently, the kinetics of GM-EIA has been reported as a predic-
tive tool either for assessing the prognosis or for the surrogate
marker for the treatment endpoint of IA (25-27). There has been
a report showing that the tendency for persistently positive PCR
was related to a poor prognosis of IA (28). The marker-guided
approach could have several advantages, as follows: 1) proper
modification of the antifungal therapy at the appropriate time,
2) determination of the optimal duration of the antifungal ther-
apy, 3) minimization of the antifungal drug use and reduction
of both the toxicity and the cost related to antifungal therapy.
  Nucleic acid-based amplification assays, including PCR and
NASBA, require numerous precautions to minimize false-posi-
tiveresultsduetopreviouslyamplifiedproductsorenvironmen-
tal presence of fungal spores or DNA (29). To date, most studies
using nucleic acid-detection tests have been focused primarily
onstandardizationandvalidationoftheaccurateandearlydiag-
nosis of IA (10, 11, 30). In this study, the patients without nega-
tive conversion of Aspergillus mRNA, even at the end of the clin-
icalcourse,showedatendencyforhigherpeakvaluesofNASBA.
The duration of the persistently positive NASBA was longer in
these patients, although the differences were not statistically sig-
nificant.TherewasasignificantassociationbetweentheNASBA
and the clinical outcome at 12 weeks, not at 6 weeks (data not
shown). The reason for this difference was possibly that the ad-
ministration of antifungal agents with known increased activity
on Aspergillusspp.,suchasvoriconazole,wasdelayedassalvage

therapy in most patients. This is attributed to the limitation of
the national health insurance system of Korea. Ultimately, supe-
rior survival in the NASBA success group implied a significant
impact of IA on mortality of immunocompromised patients.
  Our study had several limitations. We investigated a relatively
smallnumberofpatients,andthesamplingintervalsforNASBA
were not uniform because data was retrospectively collected.
ThisstudyincludedpossiblecasesofIAthatcouldimpactonthe
results. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is the
first report showing that patients with the persistently positive
NASBA at the end of the clinical course were significantly asso-
ciated with both treatment failure and death attributable to IA.
We consider that our findings have to be complemented by the
well-designed future studies performed on a larger scale.
  In conclusion, the serial monitoring of RTi-NASBA correlated
well with the clinical outcome of IA in patients with hematolog-
ic diseases during the antifungal treatment. It is suggested that
the RTi-NASBA can be used as a useful marker to predict the
treatment response and clinical outcome of IA.
