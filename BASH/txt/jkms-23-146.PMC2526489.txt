INTRODUCTION
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked congen-
ital immune-deficiency syndrome characterized by the triad
of recurrent infection, eczema, and thrombocytopenia, and
bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA-matched
related donor is an effective treatment (1, 2). Patients with-
out an appropriate related donor could receive an alternative
stem cell source such as matched unrelated donor or cord
blood. However, the transplant with the alternative donor
needed more intensive conditioning to overcome the hema-
tologic and immunologic barrier with increased treatment-
related toxicity. Recently, fludarabine-based reduced toxici-
ty myeloablative conditioning regimens have been develop-
ed for adult myeloid malignancies with promising results of
good engraftment and low treatment related toxicities (3-5).
To increase the engraftment potential without serious com-
plications, a boy with WAS received BMT from a matched
unrelated donor with a reduced toxicity myeloablative con-
ditioning regimen.
CASE REPORT

infection, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count less than
10×109

Unrelated Bone Marrow Transplantation with a Reduced Toxicity
Myeloablative Conditioning Regimen in Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked congenital immune-deficiency syn-
drome, and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has become a curative modality.
However, the transplant with the alternative donor needed more intensive condi-
tioning with increased treatment-related toxicities. Recently, fludarabine-based reduc-
ed toxicity myeloablative conditioning regimens have been developed for adult myeloid
malignancies with promising results of good engraftment and low treatment-relat-
ed toxicities. To increase the engraftment potential without serious complications,
a boy with WAS received successful unrelated BMT with a reduced toxicity myeloab-
lative conditioning regimen composed of fludarabine (40 mg/m2
on days -8, -7, -6,
-5, -4, -3), busulfan (0.8 mg/kg i. v. q 6 hr on days -6, -5, -4, -3), and thymoglobulin
(2.5 mg/kg on days -4, -3, -2). This novel conditioning regimen could improve the
outcome of allogeneic transplantation for other non-malignant diseases such as
congenital immune-deficiency syndromes or metabolic storage diseases.

lated male donor confirmed by a high-resolution molecular
method, after the conditioning regimen composed of fludara-
bine (40 mg/m2
on days -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3), busulfan (0.8
mg/kg i.v. q 6 hr on days -6, -5, -4, -3), and thymoglobulin
(2.5 mg/kg on days -4, -3, -2). Written informed consent
was obtained from parents of the patient before transplanta-
tion. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was com-
posed of cyclosporin, methotrexate (15 mg/kg on day 1, 10
mg/kg on days 3 and 6), and thymoglobulin (1.25 mg/kg on
days 7, 9, 11). Other supportive care was performed accord-
ing to the guideline for stem cell transplantation of our cen-
ter (6). The number of infused nucleated cells and CD34-pos-
itive cells were 7.6×108
/kg and 6.2×106
/kg, respectively.
He received G-CSF from 7 days after stem cell infusion and
the nadir of white blood cells (0.09×109
/L) occurred 12 days
after transplantation. The number of days required for abso-
lute neutrophil count of more than 0.5×109
/L and 1.0×
109
/L were 14 days and 15 days, respectively, and sponta-
neous platelet recovery to more than 20×109
/L and 100×
109
/L required 16 days and 43 days, respectively. Grade I
hematuria, grade II proteinuria, and grade II hepatic toxici-
ty occurred during the transplantation but recovered spon-
taneously. No other serious complications occurred during
transplantation. Grade II acute GVHD occurred 17 days
after transplantation but resolved after the treatment with
steroid. Bone marrow examination performed at one month
post-transplantation revealed the donor type chimerism at
98.4% analyzed by short tandem repeat analysis and the nor-
mal polymerase chain reaction pattern in exons of the WAS
gene (Fig. 1). After 3 months of transplantation, complete
donor type chimerism was achieved. Post-transplatation lym-
phoproliferative disease occurred 4 months after BMT but
completely resolved with rituximab therapy. Chronic GVHD
did not occur, and he is alive at 16 months after transplan-
tation without any disease characteristics of WAS.
DISCUSSION
Purine-analog, in particular, fludarabine, has an advantage
over cyclophosphamide. It has an immunosuppressive prop-
erty that allows the engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells
with minimal extramudullary toxicities (3-5). However, flu-
darabine-based non-myeloablative conditioning with a reduc-
ed myeloablative activity by reduction in busulfan dosage
than the conventional conditioning regimen was not so suc-
cessful owing to the poor engraftment in congenital immune-
deficiency syndromes (7, 8). Transplantation with fludara-
bine-based reduced toxicity but fully myeloablative condi-
tioning regimen using the conventional dose of busulfan
resulted in good engraftment without serious complications
in WAS. This kind of conditioning regimen could improve
the outcome of allogeneic transplantation for non-malignant
diseases such as congenital immune-deficiency syndromes
or metabolic storage diseases.
