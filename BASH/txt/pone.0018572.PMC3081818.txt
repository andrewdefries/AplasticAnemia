Abstract
Introduction: Acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a rare and progressive disease characterized by an immune-
mediated functional impairment of hematopoietic stem cells. Transplantation of these cells is a first-line treatment option if
HLA-matched related donors are available. First-line immunosuppressive therapy may be offered as alternative. The aim was
to compare the outcome of these patients in controlled trials.
Methods: A systematic search was performed in the bibliographic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library.
To show an overview of various outcomes by treatment group we conducted a meta-analysis on overall survival. We
evaluated whether studies reported statistically significant factors for improved survival.
Results: 26 non-randomized controlled trials (7,955 patients enrolled from 1970 to 2001) were identified. We did not identify
any RCTs. Risk of bias was high except in 4 studies. Young age and recent year of treatment were identified as factors for
improved survival in the HSCT group. Advanced age, SAA without very severe aplastic anemia, and combination of anti-
lymphocyte globulin with cyclosporine A were factors for improved survival in the IST group. In 19 studies (4,855 patients),
summary statistics were sufficient to be included in meta-analysis. Considerable heterogeneity did not justify a pooled
estimate. Adverse events were inconsistently reported and varied significantly across studies.
Conclusions: Young age and recent year of treatment were identified as factors for improved survival in the transplant
group. Advanced age, SAA without very severe aplastic anemia, and combination of anti-lymphocyte globulin with
cyclosporine A were factors for improved survival in the immunosuppressive group. Considerable heterogeneity of non-
randomized controlled studies did not justify a pooled estimate. Adverse events were inconsistently reported and varied
significantly across studies.

Introduction
Acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a rare [1] and potentially
fatal disease which is characterized by hypocellular bone marrow and
pancytopenia, and mainly affects young adults. The incidence rate was
estimated at less than 4 per million people per year [2]. The major signs
and symptoms are severe infections, bleeding, and exhaustion. The
underlying pathophysiology is thought to be an aberrant immune
response involving the T-cell mediated destruction of hematopoietic
stem cells. In most cases, the cause is unknown, although various
triggers such as drugs, toxins, and viruses have been reported [3,4].
The treatment of SAA mainly includes immunosuppressive
therapy (IST) with antithymocyte globulin (ATG)/antilymphocyte
globulin (ALG) and cyclosporine A (CSA), or allogeneic hema-
topoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [3,4,5]. Allogeneic
HSCT is seen as the treatment of choice for selected patients with
an HLA-matched related donor [6,7]. Allogeneic HSCT is
associated with graft failure, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD),
and organ toxicities. On the other hand, patients may not respond
to IST and long-term IST is associated with the development of
clonal diseases [8]. Clinical treatment algorithms have been
suggested to find a decision that meets individual conditions,
personal preferences, and prognostic factors [9].
The present systematic review and meta-analysis compares the
outcome after first-line HLA-matched related donor HSCT vs.
IST in SAA patients in published controlled trials.
Methods
While preparing this systematic review and meta-analysis, we
endorsed the PRISMA statement, adhered to its principles and
conformed to its checklist [10,11].
Study inclusion criteria
We included patients with acquired severe aplastic anemia who
received, as first-line treatment, allogeneic HSCT from HLA-
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | e18572
matched related donors (MRD) as the test intervention and IST as
the control intervention. Study design was limited to randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized intervention studies
[12]. We did not set a minimum sample size to be considered. Full-
text publications in English language were considered. We set no
limits on year of publication or year of treatment. A protocol is not
available.
Search strategy
MEDLINE (1950 to 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010) and The
Cochrane Library (to 2010) were searched without restrictions on
study design and publication year (final search 10 January 2010).
The first database search was conducted 24 January 2006. The
final search 10 January 2010 included a modified strategy to
consider MeSH changes and to render the exclusion of animal
studies more precisely. The MeSH term BONE MARROW
TRANSPLANTATION was deleted from one category [13]. For
MeSH 2008 there was a major revision of Publication Types (PT)
and the phrase ‘‘as Topic’’ was added [14]. We introduced
(ANIMALS not (ANIMALS and HUMANS)).sh. and replaced
(ANIMALS not HUMANS).sh. To account for these changes,
both searches were not restricted to any publication year. The
terms and the syntax used for the search in MEDLINE via Ovid
as shown in Table 1 were tailored to the requirements of the
other 2 databases. Reference lists of all included original articles
and 5 recent reviews (2007 to 2009) [8,9,15,16,17] were hand-
searched. Abstracts of the American Society of Hematology
Annual Meeting 2004 to 2009 [18] and information on studies
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov [19] were searched online (April
2010).
Study selection
First, articles were excluded if the title and/or the abstract
clearly referred to other diagnoses than severe aplastic anemia and
in addition clearly referred to other interventions than allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Second, articles not
excluded in the first step were evaluated whether patients were
analyzed in a test group after first-line allogeneic HSCT from a
MRD and were compared with patients after first-line IST in a
control group. Reporting of extractable information about overall
survival was required for all included studies. For each excluded
study, an appropriate reason was documented (Figure 1). All steps
of the literature screening process were performed by two
independent reviewers. Any disagreements were resolved by
discussion. Criteria for classification of severity of aplastic anemia
and quality of response after immunosuppressive treatment were
applied according to the EBMT [21][20].
Risk of bias
Risk of bias within studies was evaluated by assessing study
design, such as retro- or prospective planning, concurrent control
group, criteria for assignment of patients to treatment arms,
control for confounding factors, and other criteria, such as
unclear selection of patients and analysis of the same patients in
both treatment groups, that may increase the risk of bias
especially in non-randomized trials [21]. A low risk of bias
required a ‘yes’ for all three of the following topics: concurrent
control group, control for confounding factors, and no other risk
of bias factors.
Risk of bias across studies was evaluated by assessing publication
bias and outcome reporting bias. We conducted funnel plots using
hazard ratios and related standard errors of each meta-analysis to
assess publication bias. We evaluated potentially relevant studies to
identify studies that may have been excluded because of missing or
insufficient outcome reporting. We evaluated published study
protocols to identify outcome reporting different from appropriate
procotols.
Primary outcome: overall survival
The primary effect measure for meta-analyses was the hazard
ratio. If the hazard ratio was not directly given in the publication,
we extracted summary statistics from Kaplan Meier survival
functions and estimated hazard ratios according to methods
proposed by Parmar 1998 [22]. For estimation, we applied a tool
which uses p-values of the appropriate log-rank test comparing
the two survival functions of interest, number of patients
analyzed, and number of events on each arm [23]. If this
information was not available, hazard ratios were deduced from
the graphical display of the survival curves, if possible. Meta-
analyses were conducted using the generic variance approach
[24,25] and the random effects model [26]. Calculations were
conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North
Carolina, USA). The results of the meta-analyses were graphi-
cally displayed by means of a forest plot. Heterogeneity of the
results was visually assessed and quantified using the I2
value
[27]. A funnel plot was prepared by using The Cochrane
Collaboration’s Review Manager 5 (http://www.cc-ims.net/
revman). In the case of considerable heterogeneity (I2
$50%), a
pooled estimate is not reasonable and, therefore, was not
calculated [28].
Subgroup analysis
Sensitivity analysis: We tried to explain heterogeneity
identified in the meta-analysis of overall survival by evaluating
dichotomized subpopulations of study and patients characteris-
tics in several sensitivity analyses [29]. Subgroups in individual
studies: We extracted overall survival data of subgroups to
reproduce survival functions from some individual studies if
reported for both treatments. Data on subgroup analyses were
extracted if available. The difference between the estimates of 2
subgroups was evaluated by conducting a test of interaction
based on meta-regression models [30]. Calculations were
conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
North Carolina, USA).
Factors for improved survival
We extracted statistically significant results from multivariate
analyses on factors for improved survival, such as age, disease
severity, treatment period, and type of IST, if reported in the
included studies.
Data collection and analysis
All steps of the data collection process were performed by two
independent reviewers. Any disagreements were resolved by
discussion. We collected study characteristics such as the number
and region of participating centers, the treatment period, the
number of analyzed patients per treatment arm, the proportion of
patients with diseases other then SAA, a regimen other than first-
line treatment, and median follow-up. Median age, gender, and
time interval from diagnosis to treatment were extracted as
patients’ characteristics. For the HSCT arm we extracted the
number of patients who were treated with conditioning irradiation
and conditioning ATG or ALG. For the IST arm we extracted the
number of patients treated with ATG or ALG alone or in
combination with CSA.
The primary outcome was overall survival from the beginning
of HSCT or IST. Kaplan Meier estimates were extracted directly
First-Line HSCT Compared to IST in SAA
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | e18572
from the text or deduced from survival curves given in the
publication. The principal summary measure was the hazard ratio
as specified in the meta-analysis section. We extracted the p-value
of the log-rank test of the overall survival functions and the 5-year
estimate of both treatment arms. Results from subgroup analyses
were also extracted.
The secondary outcomes were overall mortality, graft failure,
GVHD, no response to IST, and health-related quality of life.

Results
Search results
Of 3,085 retrieved publications, 358 full-text papers were
obtained for further assessment and 26 non-randomized controlled
clinical trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria and
were included in the present study [31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,
39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56]. We did
not identify any RCTs.
An overview of the study characteristics is presented in Table 2.
Patients were recruited between 1970 and 2002 in 24 studies,
whereas in 2 studies, year of treatment was not reported. In 13
studies [31,34,35,39,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,49,54], disease severity
(SAA or VSAA) or first-line treatment was clearly classified for all
patients. The proportion of patients with moderate aplastic
anemia, unknown disease severity, or second-line treatment was
less than 20% in 6 studies [32,36,38,40,50,52] and was 20% or
more in 7 studies [33,37,48,51,53,55,56]. 25 included trials used
information about the availability of MRD to allocate patients to
comparison groups, called Mendelian (genetic) randomization [57,58].
In 3 studies [41,52,53], relevant data were not reported for the
total study population but were reported separately for subgroups.
Baseline data
An overview of characteristics of 7,955 analyzed patients in 26
studies is presented in Table 3. Median age (HSCT vs. IST: 9–24
vs. 5–55 years) was reported in 15 of 26 studies and the difference
between groups was not statistically different (sign test: p = 0.119).
Gender (HSCT vs. IST: 44–76 vs. 43–78 percent males) was
reported in 19 of 26 studies and median of the time from diagnosis
to treatment (HSCT vs. IST: 27–300 vs. 12–150 days) was
reported in 15 of 26 studies.
An overview of the treatment characteristics is presented in
Table 4. Conditioning irradiation was reported in 22 of 26 studies
(0%–100%) and ATG or ALG was used in 9 studies (2%–100%) in
the HSCT arms. In the IST arms, ATG or ALG (8%–100%) and
CSA (0%–100%) was reported in 25 of 26 studies. IST was
composed of ATG or ALG in 25 studies and was combined with
CSA in 13 studies.
Primary outcome: overall survival
An overview of the overall survival is presented in Table 5. 5-
year overall survival was reported in 17 studies (HSCT vs. IST:
32%–98% vs. 37%–92%). 5 studies reported a statistically sig-
nificant difference of survival functions in favor of HSCT
[38,47,48,50,51] and 1 study in favor of IST [46]. 9 studies
[31,33,35,40,42,43,49,54,55] did not find a statistically significant
difference of survival functions and 11 studies did not report a
significance test.
We included 19 studies (4,855 patients) [31,32,33,35,37,38,
39,40,42,43,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,54,55] in a meta-analysis on
overall survival, which provided summary statistics required
for estimating the hazard ratio. The pooled hazard ratio was
statistically not significant and was characterized by a considerable
heterogeneity indicated by an I2
value of 75% (Figure 2). A pooled
estimate was not justified.

Risk of bias
Risk of bias within studies was high for 21 of 26 included studies
mainly due to flaws of study design, assignment of patients to treatment
groups, and missing control for confounding (Table 6). In 7 studies, an
upper age limit was applied as additional assignment criteria.
The funnel plot of 19 studies included in meta-analysis shows no
asymmetry (Figure 3), which may be consistent with absent
publication bias. In 7 of 26 included studies, data of the primary
outcome were not sufficiently reported to be included in the main
meta-analysis.
Subgroup and sensitivity analysis
The difference between the estimates was not statistically
significant in both approaches and for all evaluated items, except
*other than SAA: MAA or not reported degree of severity.

for age, which was statistically significant in the evaluation of
subgroups from individual studies and not statistically significant in
the sensitivity analysis (Table 7).
Factors for improved overall survival
We evaluated patient characteristics that were evaluated in
multivariate regression analyses (Table 8). 11 studies reported
statistically significant factors for improved survival and 15 studies
did not. Frequency of reporting the main factors, that is, age, year
of transplant and type of IST is presented in Table 9.
Young age was identified as a statistically significant factor for
improved overall survival for patients in the HSCT group in 5
studies. The results for patients in the IST group were less clear
because advanced age was a favorable factor in 3 studies and
young age a favorable factor in 2 studies. The actual age limit,
which was used to dichotomize participants into young vs.
advanced age varied across studies. Level of polymorphonuclear
neutrophilic granulocytes (PMN) between 0.2 G/L and 0.5 G/L
was found to be an important factor for improved survival after
IST in 5 studies. Only 1 study found an advantage with less than
0.2 G/L in patients who were younger than 17 years. Recent year
of treatment was an important factor for improved survival after
HSCT in 4 studies and after IST in 1 study. Improvement of
outcome over time was accompanied with treatment refinement,
such as combination of methotrexate with CSA for GVHD
prophylaxis and reduction of conditioning irradiation. Another
example of improvement of outcome with treatment refinement is
the combination of ALG and CSA instead of monotherapy of
ALG. This combination was identified as factor for improved
survival in 2 studies.
Secondary outcomes
An overview of graft failure, GVHD, no response, and overall
mortality is presented in Table 10. Graft failure (reported in 15
studies) ranged from 1% to 43%, acute GVHD grade II to IV
(reported in 16 studies) ranged from 0% to 88%, and extensive

First-Line HSCT Compared to IST in SAA
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 April 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | e18572
chronic GVHD (reported in 10 studies) ranged from 3 to 27%. No
response to IST (extractable from 14 studies) ranged from 6% to
71%. Overall mortality was reported in 23 studies (HSCT vs. IST:
3%–67% vs. 9%–58%).
Discussion
Primary outcome
We found high risk of bias among 26 identified nonrandomized
controlled studies. Considerable heterogeneity of 19 studies
included in a meta-analysis of overall survival did not justify a
pooled estimate. The aim to compare the primary outcome
between treatment groups in an overall synthesis of available data
was not achieved. We were able to identify statistically significant
factors for improved overall survival reported in the studies. Young
age (rather than advanced age) and recent (rather than earlier)
year of treatment were associated with a better overall survival in
the HSCT group. Advanced age (rather than young age), SAA
without VSAA (rather than VSAA), and combination of ALG and
CSA (rather than ALG alone) were associated with a better overall
survival in the IST group. While pooling data on overall survival
of all participating patients did not appear sensible, we conducted
sensitivity meta-analysis of subgroups to explain heterogeneity and
of subgroups reported in individual studies. Unfortunately, these
evaluations were hampered by the fact that individual patient data
were not available and instead of that we relied on published
aggregate data if reported. It should be mentioned that ALG is no
longer available.
Although young age was recognized as a major influence factor
on overall survival, the appropriate definition for young age varies
considerably across studies. For example, the cut-off for young vs.
advanced age was 16 years in the study of Bacigalupo 2008 [16],
30 years in the study of Ljungman 2009 [59], and 40 years in the
study of Marsh 2009 [9].
Bacigalupo 2008 [16] reported that the outcome has improved
since 1996 for HSCT but not for IST. This result was supported
by 4 studies whereas 1 study did find an improvement for the IST
group as well. Several factors may have contributed to recent
improvements for HSCT, such as detailed HLA-matching, less
irradiation-based conditioning, less acute GVHD with a prophy-
laxis combination of methotrexate plus CSA instead of metho-
trexate alone [34], refinement of the type and dosage of
conditioning drugs, and general advancement of medical and
nursing clinical science.
We found that a combination therapy of ALG plus CSA favored
overall survival in the IST group, underscoring that refinement of
therapy obviously has also improved the outcome with IST.
Gafter-Gvili 2008 [60] concluded in a systematic review and meta-
analysis that combination of ALG plus CSA should be considered
the gold standard for IST for patients with SAA.
6 studies [33,37,38,39,41,50] evaluated whether the disease
severity of VSAA (PMN ,0.2 G/L) vs. SAA (without VSAA;
PMN 0.2 to ,0.5 G/L) had an impact on overall survival. 5
studies [33,37,38,39,50] consistently found that SAA without
VSAA favored the outcome in IST group when compared to
VSAA. 2 studies [39,50] included only children and 3 studies
[33,37,38] included also adults. These results may suggest that
HSCT may be the preferred treatment option for patients with
VSAA and that IST may be the preferred option for patients with
SAA without VSAA. However, Fu¨hrer 2005 [41] reported
contradictory results that VSAA favored the outcome in IST
group. The results may be relevant for children only because all
analyzed patients were younger than 17 years of age. We did not
find another study confirming the results, especially not in 2
studies mentioned above.
We believe that this is the first comprehensive systematic review

Secondary outcomes
Studies inconsistently reported adverse events and their
frequencies varied significantly across studies. Graft failure was
highest in early studies but could affect up to 18% of patients in
recent studies. Rates for acute GVHD grade III to IV reached up
to 40% and for extensive chronic GVHD reached up to 24% in
recent studies. A considerable number of patients not responding
to IST may indicate the importance of unrelated donor
transplantation.
Duplicate publication bias
Identical data may have been included twice in the present
systematic review. We searched for follow-up papers of a single
study to include the update version and exclude former pre-
sentations. Register analyses can provide results based on a large
number of patients but registers may use data that may
have been published previously by the contributing study centers.
We identified 5 studies published on behalf of the EBMT
[33,34,50,51] which are probably based on overlapping data.
Locasciulli 2007 [51] presented an update of the EBMT data and,
therefore, investigated considerably more patients (2479 patients)
than Locasciulli 1990 [50] (304 patients). The courses of the
survival functions are clearly different between the 2 studies. In
Locasciulli 1990 [50] (Figure 1 of the article), in the majority of the
follow-up period the course of the Kaplan-Meier curve after
HSCT is above that after IST (congruent in the first 12 months),
indicating an advantage from HSCT. In Locasciulli 2007 [51]
(Figure 1 of the article), in the majority of the follow-up period the
course of the Kaplan-Meier curve after HSCT is below that after
IST (in the first 60 months). Only at the very end of the follow-up
period (from 100 to 120 months) is the HSCT curve above the IST
curve. The difference between the 2 survival functions was
assessed by a log-rank test. The authors stated that 10-year survival
was significantly superior in patients treated with BMT than in those in whom
immunosuppression was used (73% versus 68%, p = 0.002). On the
contrary, we are convinced that the survival functions clearly show
that IST was statistically significantly better than HSCT. Our

interpretation of the results is supported by Linden 2007 [61], who
addressed the specific problem of interpreting the crossing of the
survival functions using Locasciulli 2007 [51] as an example.
Locasciulli 1990 [50] clearly reported that only data from SAA
patient were included. In contrast, Locasciulli 2007 [51] included
a considerable proportion of patients with moderate aplastic
anemia or with unknown severity of disease. A study population
with different patients’ characteristics with respect to disease
severity might have contributed to the different results. Medical
advancement after a time difference of 17 years between
publication dates of both studies might have had a greater impact
on improved survival after HSCT than on survival after IST.
Outcome reporting bias
Outcome reporting bias [62] is defined as the selection of a subset
of the originally recorded outcome variables for publication.
Systematic reviews need to address the issue of missing outcome
data because outcome reporting bias can affect their conclusions [63].
We identified considerable outcome reporting bias. A major flaw of
all studies was the lack of statistical summary data such as standard
Figure 3. Funnel plot using data from Figure 3. Distribution of estimates can be regarded as funnel-shaped and compatible with a moderate
publication bias. Abbreviations: SE: standard error.

Study publication bias
Study publication bias is defined as publication of research
results depending on their results [64]. Funnel plots of both
reported meta-analyses show moderate asymmetry and do not
indicate considerable publication bias. The strengths of the
present systematic review are the broadness of the search
strategy and the comprehensiveness of the published data
included. Nevertheless, there may be a slight possibility that an
unknown number of studies were not registered and not
published.

Language bias
Results in English language articles could be different from
those of articles written in other languages [65]. Non-English
language articles require expensive translations to prevent selective
outcome extraction and misinterpretation of results. Funding for
translation was not provided and we excluded all non-English
language articles, including German articles. Restricting the
inclusion of studies to English articles may have little effect on
summary treatment effect estimates [66,67] and German language
articles may not play a preeminent role in the dissemination of
medical research [68].
Internal validity
We identified a high risk of bias within all non-randomized
controlled studies except for 4 studies. Assignment of patients to
treatment groups was reported to be based on availability of MRD
in all 26 studies, although, in 7 studies an upper age limit was

applied as additional assignment criteria. This type of allocation
has specific requirements, such as allelic vs. serologic typing,
number of analyzed loci, time spent searching for donors,
documentation of all individuals analyzed including families of
IST patients, number of analyzed individuals per family, intent-to-
treat analysis. However, these requirements were not reported in
the included studies.
Heterogeneity
We included as many controlled studies as possible in order to
not miss any valuable outcome information. Consequently, we
accepted studies that considered a considerable number of patients
with moderate aplastic anemia or unknown disease severity.
Pooling of data from patients with varying characteristics may
have compromised the generalizability of results. Furthermore,
important subgroups such as young and advanced age were
confused in the meta-analysis.
In an attempt to reduce heterogeneity we strictly confined the
meta-analysis to studies that clearly included at least 80% of
patients with SAA and first-line treatment (data not shown). We
found a moderate heterogeneity and a statistically significant
pooled estimate that favored HSCT. Many studies including large
and recently published ones were excluded. The result suggested a
global preference for one treatment disregarding conditions other
than the treatment that might have a determined impact on the
outcome. We believe that this procedure would have introduced a
study selection bias and a misleading conclusion and was therefore
not pursued.
Strengths and limitations of the present review
The strengths of this review are the broadness of the search
strategy and the comprehensiveness of the published data
included. Significant factors that may influence the survival of
the patients were considered in the present systematic review. We
estimated hazard ratios from published aggregate survival
functions and did not use individual patient data. Subgroup
analysis was not helpful to explain considerable heterogeneity
found in meta-analysis. While the results of the meta-analysis may
not be conclusive, they can provide useful summaries of the state
of knowledge.
Conclusions
Young age and recent year of treatment were identified as
factors for improved survival in the transplant group. Advanced
age, SAA without very severe aplastic anemia, and combination of
anti-lymphocyte globulin with cyclosporine A were factors for
improved survival in the immunosuppressive group. Considerable
heterogeneity of non-randomized controlled studies did not justify
a pooled estimate. Adverse events were inconsistently reported and
varied significantly across studies.
