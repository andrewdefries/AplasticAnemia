Abstract
Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) belongs to the genus Gammaretrovirus, and causes a variety of neoplastic and non-neoplastic
diseases in cats. Alteration of viral env sequences is thought to be associated with disease specificity, but the way in which
genetic diversity of FeLV contributes to the generation of such variants in nature is poorly understood. We isolated FeLV env
genes from naturally infected cats in Japan and analyzed the evolutionary dynamics of these genes. Phylogenetic
reconstructions separated our FeLV samples into three distinct genetic clusters, termed Genotypes I, II, and III. Genotype I is
a major genetic cluster and can be further classified into Clades 1–7 in Japan. Genotypes were correlated with geographical
distribution; Genotypes I and II were distributed within Japan, whilst FeLV samples from outside Japan belonged to
Genotype III. These results may be due to geographical isolation of FeLVs in Japan. The observed structural diversity of the
FeLV env gene appears to be caused primarily by mutation, deletion, insertion and recombination, and these variants may
be generated de novo in individual cats. FeLV interference assay revealed that FeLV genotypes did not correlate with known
FeLV receptor subgroups. We have identified the genotypes which we consider to be reliable for evaluating phylogenetic
relationships of FeLV, which embrace the high structural diversity observed in our sample. Overall, these findings extend our
understanding of Gammaretrovirus evolutionary patterns in the field, and may provide a useful basis for assessing the
emergence of novel strains and understanding the molecular mechanisms of FeLV transmission in cats.

Introduction
Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is an exogenous retrovirus,
belonging to the genus Gammaretrovirus. FeLV has been shown to
induce many diseases in cats, such as thymic lymphoma,
multicentric lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute
myeloid leukemia (AML), aplastic anemia, and immunodeficiency
[1], [2]. The outcome of natural FeLV infection is variable, and
little is known about the mechanisms of pathogenesis. Variants of
FeLV that induce specific types of disease have been described,
and several characteristic genetic changes in the long terminal
repeat (LTR), as well as the env gene in the viral genomes appear to
be responsible for pathogenicity. For example, FeLV proviruses
molecularly cloned from lymphomas typically contain two or three
tandem direct repeats of enhancer elements in the LTR [3–5]. On
the other hand, LTRs of FeLVs derived from non-neoplastic
disease or weakly pathogenic strains contain only a single copy of
the enhancer [4], [6–9], but may contain other repeated elements
such as the upstream region of the enhancer (URE) in MDS [1]
and AML [10], [11], and the 21-bp triplication in non-T-cell
disease [12], [13].
In addition to characteristic LTR structures, env genes also
appear to play a role in pathogenicity. For example, the env gene of
an anemia-inducing FeLV variant (Sarma strain) contains
mutations and recombination, and its pathogenicity results from
the Env protein binding to and disrupting the cellular function of
FLVCR1, which acts as a receptor for the strain [14–16].
Mutations of the env gene and unique receptor usage have also
been identified in FeLV variants that cause immunosuppression in
cats (feline acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) [7], [17–18],
and several other studies have similarly linked disease outcome to
determinants located in the env region [19], [20].
The primary translation product of the FeLV env gene is
processed through proteolytic cleavage into two functional units:
the surface protein (SU; gp70) and the transmembrane protein
(TM; p15E). The entry of retroviruses into target cells is governed
by the interaction of glycoproteins on the retroviral SU with
specific cell surface receptors [21]. FeLV can be categorized into
several FeLV subgroups based on their interference and host range
properties: FeLV-A, FeLV-B, FeLV-C, FeLV-AC and FeLV-T
[14], [16], [22–24]. In addition to these FeLV subgroups, our
laboratory recently identified a novel FeLV subgroup (FeLV-D)
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61009
which was generated by ERV-DC env transduction [25]. FeLV-A
is the most common subtype, and other subtypes may have arisen
from this variant. For instance, it has been shown that FeLV-B
arose through recombination in the env region between FeLV-A
and endogenous FeLV sequences (enFeLV) present in the feline
genome [9], [26], and FeLV-C apparently also arose through
deletion and mutation of the FeLV-A env gene [2], [27]. Since the
initial discovery of FeLV in domestic cats in 1964 [28–29], the
virus has also been isolated from wild cats such as the Florida
panther [30] and the Iberian lynx [31]. Preventing FeLV infection
in both domestic and wild cats is of considerable interest. In the
present study, we investigated patterns of FeLV genetic diversity
based on entire env gene sequences sampled from FeLV isolates
throughout Japan, as well as env gene sequences of several
additional FeLV isolates from Europe and the Americas. We
identify genotypes encompassing the full range of FeLV structural
diversity, which we consider to be reliable for evaluating the
phylogenetic relationships of the virus. Overall, the findings of this
study extend the understanding of Gammaretrovirus evolutionary
patterns in the field, and may provide a useful basis for assessing
the emergence of novel strains and understanding the molecular
mechanisms of FeLV transmission in cats. Our results may also
provide insights into disease alteration caused by mutations of the
env gene.
Materials and Methods
Epidemiological Survey of the Prevalence of FeLV
Infection
From March to October 2008, a total of 1770 EDTA-
anticoagulated blood samples were collected from cats admitted
at 47 private veterinary hospitals, one located in each prefecture of
Japan. The samples were voluntarily submitted from veterinarians.
For each cat, the age, sex, and primary complaint were recorded.
The health profile of these cats has been partly described
previously [32]. Blood samples were stored between 220 and
230uC prior to DNA extraction, and each of the 1770 samples
was tested for serological evidence of FeLV infection by screening
for the FeLV Gag antigen using a commercially-available test kit
(SNAP FeLV/FIV combo kit; IDEXX Laboratories Inc., USA). A
summary of the FeLV status, age, gender and other basic
background data for the sample of cats is provided in Table 1.
Cats that had outdoor access at least once a week were included in
the study.
Detection and Amplification of FeLV Proviral DNA
Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples testing positive
for the FeLV antigen, using the QIAamp DNA Blood kit
(QIAGEN, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. PCR primers for a full-length FeLV env amplification
were designed from the conserved regions of pol, env, and LTR
sequences of FeLV strains. PCR primers used were as follows: Fe-
8S (59-CATCGAGATGGAAGGTCCAACG-39, position 5974–
5995 of FeLV-A 61E (GeneBank M18247), Fe-4S (59-
TCCAACGCACCCAAAACCCTCT-39, position 5989–6010 of
FeLV-A 61E), Fe-3R (59-CATGGTYGGTCYGGATCG-
TATTG-39, position 7886–7908 of FeLV-A 61E), Fe-9S (59-
GAGACCTCTAGCGGCGGCCTAC-39, position 5711–5732 of
FeLV-A 61E), Fe-7R (59-GTCAACTGGGGAGCCTGGAGAC-
39, position 8174–8195 of FeLV-A 61E) and PRB1 (59-
CTGTTCACTCCTCGACAACG-39 [33]). The PCR primers
used to amplify the c-myc exon 2 region were MY-1F (59-
GAGGAGGAGAACTTCTACCAGCA-39) and MY-2R (59-
CTGCAGGTACAAGCTGGAGGT-39).
PCR was performed using approximately 100 ng genomic
DNA in 50 mL reactions, with PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase
enzyme (Takara, Japan). PCR cycling conditions were as follows:
98uC for 10 s, 62uC for 5 s, 72uC for 1.5 min, for 30 cycles,
followed by 5 min at 72uC. PCR products were directly cloned
into the pCR4Blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) or the pUC118
vector (Mighty cloning kit, Takara), and these recombinants were
also used as a plasmid library to isolate full-length FeLV-B env
genes and env deletion mutants. For detection of FeLV-B env, PCR
was performed as described above, using primers PRB1 and Fe-
3R. This primer pair is specific for FeLV-B, and a full-length
FeLV-B env was isolated by screening the env plasmid library with
colony PCR methods using these two primers. Based on the entire
env gene, non-recombinant virus, recombinant virus including
FeLV-B (identified by PCR) and non-FeLV-B (identified by
recombination analysis), and deletion type and/or insertion type

virus were isolated from the plasmid libraries using primer pairs
Fe-8S/4S and Fe-3R. Alternatively, the entire env gene was
amplified with primers Fe-9S and Fe-7R (specific for pol and
exogenous LTR U3 regions), and these fragments were cloned into
the pCR4Blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). PCR was performed
on a TaKaRa PCR Thermal Cycler Dice (Takara, Japan), and
plasmids were sequenced with an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA).
Recombination Analysis
The Simplot software (version 3.5.1) was initially used to
perform similarity and boot scanning analyses of a query sequence
against a set of other sequences [34], [35]. This method measures
the similarity/dissimilarity of the query sequence to a set of
reference sequences.
Phylogenetic Analysis
The env sequences were aligned using Muscle [36] and these
initial alignments were manually edited by eye in SEAVIEW [37].
FeLV env sequences from the NCBI database (see Table S1) were
also included in the alignments. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses
were based on virtually complete sequences of the SU and TM
regions within the env gene (position 6080–7885 of FeLV-A 61E).
Recombinant env genes, including FeLV-B identified by recombi-
nation analyses, were usually excluded from the data set for the
purposes of phylogenetic reconstruction. However, partial se-
quences from some recombinants were included in the analyses
after excluding their recombinant regions to determine FeLV
genotype from cats (ST19, IT10, WY24, SA15 and IT38), from
which non-recombinants were not identified. Partial sequences
from representatives of the FeLV-C and FeLV-B subgroups were
also used for the analyses. Phylogenetic trees were estimated using
both the maximum likelihood method (ML) [38] and the neighbor
joining approach (NJ) [39], and sequences from endogenous
FeLVs were used as outgroups to root the trees. ML reconstruc-
tions were performed in PhyML [40], applying the general time-
reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution. Nodal support
was assessed via a likelihood-ratio test (LRT) [41], [42], as
implemented in PhyML. NJ trees were constructed using
CLUSTALW [43], [44], and distances were calculated using the
Kimura two-parameter (K2P) method [45]. To assess the support
for nodes in the NJ trees, a bootstrap analysis was performed using
1000 pseudoreplicates. Phylogenetic trees were visualized using
MEGA5 [46], [47].
Viral Interference Assay
Construction of FeLV env-expression plasmids and performance
of viral interference assays using GPLac cells have been described
elsewhere [25]. FeLV env fragments subcloned in pCR4Blunt-
TOPO were EcoRI-digested, and FeLV env genes in pUC118 were
PCR-amplified using primers Fe-44S and Fe-50R (59-
CGGAATTCATCGAGATGGAAGGTCC-39 and 59-
TTGAATTCTCATGGTTGGTCTGGATCGTATTG-39 re-
spectively). The restriction sites for EcoRI are underlined. These
products were cloned into pFUDss expression plasmid. GPLac
cells, which contain MLV gag-pol and pMXs-nlsLacZ-IRES-Puror
(pMXs-nLIP) retroviral reporter, were transfected with FeLV env-
expressing plasmids to produce LacZ-carrying pseudotype viruses.
After selection of the cells with 200 mg/ml Zeocin and 1 mg/ml
Puromycin for .2 weeks, filtered supernatants were used for viral
interference assays. HEK293T [48], [49] or AH927 cells [50]
persistently infected with FeLV-A clone33 [10], FeLV-B GA
(Gardner-Arnstein) strain [51], FeLV-C Sarma strain [8], or non-
infected cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Minimal Essential
Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). These
cells were infected with each pseudotype virus in the presence of
polybrene (4 mg/ml) for 2 days, and then stained with X-gal (5-
bromo-4-chloro-indolyl-b-D-galactopyranoside). Microscopic vi-
sualizations of the results were saved as digital images, and blue-
stained nuclei were counted as infectious units (I.U.).
Analysis of Branch-specific Selection Forces
For these phylogenetic analyses, we utilized env gene sequences
that meet the following criteria: a) have no recombination with
enFeLV; b) are longer than 1800-bp; c) do not contain any frame
shift mutations or undetermined nucleotides. We then translated
these sequences and computed a multiple alignment at the amino
acid level using the L-INS-i module of the MAFFT program [52].
Applying this amino acid alignment, we generated a correspond-
ing nucleotide sequence alignment using TranslatorX [53]. Based
on the multiple alignment of nucleotide sequences, we performed
phylogenetic tree reconstruction using ML methods as imple-
mented in RAxML v. 7.2.6 [54], applying the GTR model with a
discrete gamma distribution to account for heterogeneity in
evolutionary rates among sites (+G), and including an estimation
of the proportion of invariant sites (+I). The robustness of the
phylogenetic tree was evaluated by rapid bootstrapping [55] with
1000 pseudoreplicate datasets. To detect branch-specific positive
selections, we used ML methods implemented in the codeml
program of the PAML v. 4.5 package [56] to calculate the ratio of
substitution rates at non-synonymous and synonymous sites (dN/
dS) for the each branch of the phylogenetic tree. We applied the
F364 codon frequency model in which the average nucleotide
frequencies are calculated separately at the three codon positions
[57].

Results
Prevalence of FeLV in Japan
A clinical and molecular-based epidemiological survey of FeLV
infection covering the whole of Japan was performed in this study.
FeLV Gag antigen-positive reactions were detected in 216 (12.2%)
of the 1770 cats from which blood samples were collected
(Table 1), and infected cats were identified in 45 of the 47 private
veterinary hospitals visited. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table S2, The
incidence of FeLV was higher in southern areas of Japan, such as
parts of the Kyu¯shu¯ area (Fukuoka, Saga, Nagasaki, Kumamoto,
Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures; .20% positive) and parts of
the Shikoku area (Ehime, Tokushima, and Ko¯chi prefectures;
.15% positive). The seroprevalence of FeLV infection in Iwate,
Yamagata, Chiba, Toyama, Wakayama, and Shimane prefectures
was also high (.15% positive) in comparison to the average FeLV
infection rates throughout Japan (12.2%). Although all owned cats
we tested had outdoor access at least once a week, there was no
clear correlation between FeLV infection and the number of days
of outdoor access (Table 1). Interestingly, of the 286 cats
vaccinated against FeLV, 18 tested positive for the virus (6.3%)

(Table 1). Overall, these results indicate that FeLV infection is
observed widely in Japan, and the control and prevention of this
infectious disease should thus be a focal point for Japanese
veterinary medicine.
Detection of Proviral env Fragments by PCR
To evaluate the divergence of the FeLV env gene across Japan,
we established a PCR method to specifically detect exogenous
FeLV env genes (Fig. 2A, B). PCR amplification using primer pairs
Fe-8S/Fe-4S and Fe-3R encompassed the entire FeLV env gene,
and resulted in a fragment of predicted size (approximately 1.9 kb)
when applied to AH927 cells infected with FeLV-A Glasgow-1
(GA5), FeLV-B Gardner-Arnstein (GB) or FeLV-C Sarma (SC)
(Fig. 2B), and when applied to FT-1 cell lines [5] derived from the
thymic lymphoma of a FeLV-positive cat, and samples of FeLV
antigen-positive blood (SN5, MZ29). However, the 1.9 kb
fragment was not detected in genomic DNA derived from
uninfected AH927 cells, or in FeLV antigen-negative feline blood
(FS23). This indicates that the primers did not amplify detectable
levels of enFeLV, and that these two primer pairs are specific for
env sequences of known FeLV-A, -B, and -C types (Fig. 2B). The
sensitivity of this PCR method for detection of the env gene was
investigated by application to the FeLV-A clone33 plasmid, and
the limit of detection was determined to be 10 fg per reaction in
this system (data not shown).
FeLV env PCR fragments were detected in 167 of the 216
samples of genomic DNA from FeLV antigen-positive cats. We
were unable to amplify FeLV env fragments in the remaining
seropositive samples, and in these samples we also failed to amplify
LTR fragments despite attempts with different primer combina-
tions, increased DNA concentration, lower annealing temperature
and different DNA polymerase enzymes. These negative results
may reflect divergent proviral sequences in primer sites for viral
detection, low viral load, or other factors.
In addition to the fragments discussed above, several smaller
fragments were amplified by the PCR primer pairs Fe-8S/Fe-4S
and Fe-3R. For example, several smaller bands in addition to the
expected 1.9-kb band were detected in FeLV-positive blood
(MZ29) (Fig. 2B), and such bands were seen in 18 of the 167 PCR-
positive samples. Eight of these 18 samples were from cats with
neoplastic disease, including five lymphomas and three suspected
cases of lymphoma. These fragments were cloned and their
identities confirmed by sequencing.
A FeLV-B-specific detection system was established by PCR
amplification using the enFeLV-specific PRB1 primer paired with
an exogenous FeLV-specific antisense primer, Fe3R. These PCR
reactions resulted in fragments with the predicted size of
approximately 1.4 kb when applied to AH927 cells infected with
FeLV-B, and FeLV antigen-positive blood (SN22), but not when
applied to FeLV-A Glasgow-1 (GA5), FeLV-C Sarma (SC), FeLV
antigen-positive (SN5) or negative blood (FS23) (Fig. 2A, B).
Sequencing was used to confirm the identity of PCR fragments
that were amplified with FeLV-B-specific primers, indicating that
the primers did not amplify detectable levels of enFeLV, and that
these primer pairs detected at least env sequences from the known
FeLV-B types. FeLV-B env was present in 74 of the 167 (44.3%)
samples of genomic DNA from FeLV antigen-positive cats in
which the env gene had been detected via PCR. Our results
regarding the incidence of FeLV-B infection were similar to results
previously reported [2], [58], [59]. Our PCR method did not

FeLV antigen-positive cats.
Phylogenetic Analysis of FeLV env Gene Sequences
We isolated 261 clones of non-recombinant full-length env genes
having an approximately 1.9 kb env gene. From the cases positive
for FeLV-B and having an approximately 1.9 kb env gene, we
isolated 76 FeLV-B specific clones, which were FeLV-B-positive,
as determined by detecting a 1.4-kb fragment of partial FeLV-B
env gene by our PCR method. In addition, from 18 cats we isolated
39 clones having several deletions of variable sizes. All of these
clones were sequenced and analyzed. For the purposes of
phylogenetic analysis, recombinant env genes such as FeLV-B,
and env genes with large deletions or insertions, were identified by
recombination analyses and excluded from the alignment (Fig. 2C).
However, sequences from cats ST19, IT10, WY24, SA15 and
IT38, (FeLV-C Sarma strain and FeLV-B GA strain), which are
recombinant env genes, were included in the multiple sequence
alignment after removal of their recombinant regions (Fig. 2D).
The results from the phylogenetic analysis of the alignment using
the ML method are shown in Fig. 3. ML and NJ methods both
retrieved similar phylogenetic topologies (data not shown), in
which all isolates (with the exception of GM35) grouped into three
major, strongly supported clades: Genotype I (GI), Genotype II
(GII), and Genotype III (GIII). Bootstrapping was employed to
assess the support for these major groups and their component
subclades, and we generally considered clades with bootstrap
support values of .90% to be robust. Within Genotype I, seven
clades were recognized as separate strains (see Fig. 3): GI/Clade1
(41 sequences), GI/Clade2 (37 sequences), GI/Clade3 (51
sequences), GI/Clade4 (10 sequences), GI/Clade5 (11 sequences),
GI/Clade6 (3 sequences), and GI/Clade7 (4 sequences). Of these,
all but one had bootstrap values ,90%; Clade 4 was supported by
a bootstrap value of only 76%, and this clade may thus be re-
classified based on future analyses. FeLV-A clone33 [10] and
pJ7E2 [5] previously isolated in Japan (obtained from the NCBI
database) clearly belong within Genotype I. Several clones with
unusually long branches were identified in the various clades (e.g.,
MZ17, IK10, NN6-1, SA15-2, SI31-3). These viruses appear to
possess different evolutionary dynamics from the other samples. In
addition to having long branches, IT12-3 and NG19-1 did not fit
into any of the clades in Genotype I. Sequence GF37-1, though
not possessing a long branch, was somewhat divergent from the
Genotype I clades and also did not fit into any of these groupings.
Genotype II consisted of samples from only seven cats, and
future large-scale analyses are likely to provide additional
resolution of relationships in this group. Genotypes I and II were
derived exclusively from Japan and were newly characterized in
this study, while all FeLV strains from Europe, South America and
the USA (obtained from the NCBI database) were classified as
Group III. Genotype III corresponds to known FeLV strains such
as FeLV-A clone 945 [60], FeLV-A 61E [6], FeLV-T 61C [7],
FeLV-A Glasgow-1 [9], FeLV-A Richard (pFRA) [61], FeLV-AC
FY981 [62], FeLVs derived from Iberian lynx [31], Brazilian
FeLVs [58], and the exogenous FeLV components of the FeLV-C
Sarma and FeLV-B GA strains. Most Genotype III samples were
included in two strongly supported groups, GIII/Clade1 and
GIII/Clade2. Sequences from a single cat (ON33) collected in
Okinawa (ON) prefecture, Japan were classified as GIII/Clade2.
Interestingly, GM35 sequences from Gunma (GM) prefecture did
not fall within any of the major genotypes. In this analysis, there
were no GI or GII viruses detected outside of Japan, suggesting
that our genotypic classification may be in some way dependent on
geographical distribution.
We did not find any cases of superinfection with multiple FeLV
groups in any cats; all clones obtained from a given individual
belonged to the same clade. Furthermore, mutant env containing
insertions or deletions, isolated from individual cats, had a high
level of homology with full-length env derived from the same
individual, suggesting that such mutants possibly occur de novo in
these individuals. Our results suggest that FeLV has perhaps
undergone extensive evolutionary diversification within Japan, and
the genetic distinctness of Japanese FeLV strains may indicate a
long history of geographical isolation in the country.
Receptor Usage of Representative FeLV env Genes from
Japan
Next, to delineate FeLV subgroups on the basis of receptor
usage, we conducted a viral interference assay. Env genes from
each genotype and clade were inserted into the mammalian
expression vector, which was introduced into GPLac cells [25] to
produce FeLV env pseudotype viruses carrying the LacZ marker
gene. HEK293T cells persistently infected with FeLV-A clone33,
FeLV-B GA and FeLV-C Sarma were superinfected with each
pseudotype virus. As shown in Table 2, the superinfection of 12
clones (two from GI/1, three from GI/2, one from GI/4, two
from GI/5, and one each from GI/6, GI/7, GI/unclassified and
GII) was completely interfered by FeLV-A clone33, but not by
FeLV-B and FeLV-C receptor subgroups. This indicates that these
Japanese isolates belong in the FeLV-A subgroup and possess the
same receptor usage as FeLVs in other countries despite their
different genotypic classification. Furthermore, pseudotype viruses
from NS33-4 (GI/3) and KC18-6 (GI/2) were unable to infect
uninfected HEK293T cells, HEK293T cells persistently infected
with FeLV-A clone33 (HEK293T/FeLV-A clone33) or cells
infected with FeLV-C Sarma (HEK293T/FeLV-C). However,

Schematics of coding sequences for the FeLV env gene are shown. FeLV proviral env sequences were amplified by PCR with the primer pairs Fe-8S/Fe-
4S and Fe-3R, PRB-1 and Fe-3R, Fe-9S and Fe-7R. The lengths of the expected products from amplifications using each primer pair are shown. The
abbreviations s.p., SU and TM represent, respectively, signal peptide, surface glycoprotein, and transmembrane subunit. (B) The DNA templates for
PCR amplifications were as follows: neg. (genomic DNA isolated from FeLV-negative AH927 cells), GA5 (DNA from FeLV-A Glasgow-1-infected AH927
cells), GB (DNA from Gardner-Arnstein FeLV-B-infected AH927 cells), SC (DNA from FeLV-C Sarma-infected AH927 cells), DNA from FT-1 cell line, DNA
from sample SN5, DNA from sample MZ29, DNA from a FeLV-positive cat (SN22), and DNA from a FeLV-negative cat (FS23). c-myc was amplified as a
positive control [25]. PCR products were electrophoresed and stained with ethidium bromide. Asterisk indicates atypical bands of env gene. (C) Each
detected PCR fragment was cloned into a cloning plasmid, and full-length env gene libraries were constructed. Several unique env genes were
isolated from these full-length env gene libraries using information on fragment size, or by screening using FeLV-B specific PCR. In addition to non-
recombinant env genes, FeLV-B-type and other recombinants were isolated and analyzed. Furthermore, env genes smaller than full length were also
analyzed. N indicates negative and P positive for FeLV-B detection or recombination detection. (D) For the most part, only non-recombinant
sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis, but where recombinant sequences were included, their endogenous-derived regions were removed
from the alignment. However, partial sequences from some recombinants as well as representatives of the FeLV-C and FeLV-B subgroups were
included in the analyses after excluding their recombinant regions, to determine the FeLV genotypes from cats from which non-recombinants were
not identified.

these pseudotype viruses could infected HEK293T cells infected
with FeLV-B GA (HEK293T/FeLV-B) (Table 2). It has previously
been reported that the FeLV-T subgroup can infect cells infected
with FeLV-B [17]. In order to determine whether NS33-4 and
KC18-6 viruses belong to the FeLV-T subgroup, the supernatant
of 3201 cells as a source of a co-factor, FeLIX, for FeLV-T was
used in an additional viral infection assay. As shown in Table 3,
both KC18-6 and NS33-4 were able to infect AH927 cells and
HEK293T cells in the presence of the conditioned medium, but
not in its absence. These FeLV clones had mutations within their
SPHQ motifs which are related to the unique receptor usage of
FeLV-T [17], suggesting that both KC18-6 and NS33-4 belong to
the FeLV-T subgroup. Taken together, our results suggest that
most of the FeLV isolates distributed in Japan may show the same
receptor usage as FeLVs in other countries despite their different
genotypes.
Geographic Distribution of Each FeLV Clade
We plotted Japanese viral isolates on a map to investigate the
relationship between geographical distribution and reconstructed
phylogenetic patterns. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table S3, GI/
Clade1 and GI/Clade2 are broadly distributed in Japan, while
GI/Clade1 is more concentrated in the To¯hoku and Kanto¯
regions, and GI/Clade2 is more concentrated in the Kinki and
Chu¯goku regions. GI/Clade3 tends to be distributed in the
Kyu¯shu¯ region. GI/Clade4 samples are found predominantly in
Ko¯chi (KC) prefecture (Shikoku region) and GI/Clade5 occur in
the prefectures of Toyama (TY)(Chu¯bu region) and Ehime (EH)
(Shikoku region) as they appear in Fig. 4 and Table S3. Most
phylogenetic groupings are thus broadly consistent with geograph-
ic distribution, indicating that the major genotypes and clades may
have arisen in allopatry within the areas of their current
occupancy, or that FeLVs were introduced several times into
Japan via distinct transmission routes. Interestingly, GI/Clade1
representatives in the Wakayama (WY) prefecture (Kinki region)
and the Kyu¯shu¯ region are substantially isolated from each other
geographically despite their close phylogenetic relationship. This
could plausibly be the result of an artificial transmission via
anthropogenic transportation of infected cats. We also analyzed
the fixation and purifying selection of each genotype and clade by
calculating the branch-specific ratios of substitutions at non-
synonymous and synonymous sites (dN/dS) (see Table S4 for a list
of the sequences used). The dN/dS ratio for the root branch of
each genotype and clade is shown on a schematic representation of
the best phylogenetic tree from ML analysis of the complete
nucleotide alignment (see Fig. S1 and Fig.S2). In most cases dN/
dS values were less than 1, providing no evidence of positive
selection. However the clade containing IT12-3 and NG19-1 had
a dN/dS ratio of 1.0322, suggesting that selection may be in
operation in this lineage.
Recombination Analysis
FeLV-B env sequences contain enFeLV env sequences as a result
of recombination. To determine structural diversity of FeLV-B,
full-length FeLV-B-like env sequences were isolated from plasmid
libraries constructed using Fe-8S and Fe-3R primers, which
amplify exogenous FeLV env genes (Fig. 2C). FeLV-B and other
recombinant sequences isolated from PCR were subjected to
similarity plot analyses following boot scanning analyses to identify
recombination events between exogenous FeLV and enFeLV
sequences (Fig. 2C, D). The recombinant env sequences were
compared with non-recombinant exogenous FeLV env sequences
derived from an identical sample or from the same clade, as well as
with enFeLV-AGTT (endogenous FeLV), using FeLV-A clone33
or FeLV-A 61E as an outgroup. Similarity plot analysis (Fig. 5A)
showed that all of FeLV-B-like env sequences arose from the
recombination of exogenous FeLV env sequences and the
endogenous FeLV-AGTT. According to the boot scanning
analyses, recombination apparently produced the FeLV-B Gard-
ner-Arnstein (GA) strain by uniting a section of 59 endogenous
FeLV env sequence and a section of 39 exogenous FeLV env
sequence. Furthermore, the FeLV-C Sarma strain was observed to
be a product of recombination events in two regions of the env
gene.
Fig. 5B shows representations of the recombination patterns
that were observed in the present study. Many cases of
recombination shared similarities with the recombination pattern
in the FeLV-B GA strain (Fig. 5B). However, some unique
recombination patterns were also observed. For example, clones
FO36-5B, KG20-5B and KM16-3B contain both the VRA and
VRB motifs from endogenous FeLV env sequences. Clones KG20-
5B and KM16-3B possess endogenous FeLV sequences within the

C-domain, and in KM16-3B the endogenous component extends
to the proline-rich region (PRR). Interestingly, four clones (SA15-2
RC, WY24-1 RC, IT38-5 RC and IT10-2 RC) isolated from non-
typical FeLV-B env sequences had only a 39 portion of endogenous
FeLV env sequence, whilst the 59 region of their env sequences (the
receptor binding domain, RBD), were apparently derived from
FeLV-A (Fig. 5B and data not shown). Some env sequences (e.g.
MZ40-5B) were almost entirely derived from endogenous FeLV
env, and in these cases the boot scanning analysis did not detect
recombination breakpoints between exogenous and endogenous
FeLV sequences. To further confirm recombination in our virus
samples, we isolated the 4B-MZ40 clone that possesses a portion of
39 pol, a full-length endogenous env gene, and an exogenous LTR
U3 section, by PCR amplification with specific primers, Fe-9S and
Fe-7R (Fig. 2A), indicating with certainty that the recombinant
virus was derived from exogenous FeLV (Fig. 5A, 5B). Interest-
ingly, VRA recombination was often coupled with VRB recom-
bination, as shown in Fig. 5B. When 59 and 39 recombination
breakpoints were marked on the corresponding positions of the
FeLV 61E env sequence, some recombination hot spots were
observed and breakpoints tended towards regions of high
homology between endogenous and exogenous FeLV sequences

(Fig. 5C). However, recombination junctions varied substantially
between different recombinant clones, indicating that multiple
recombination events have occurred, producing appreciable
structural diversity of the FeLV env gene. Furthermore, many
recombinant viruses have apparently arisen de novo in individual
cats. In order to determine whether recombinant viruses isolated
in Japan belong to the FeLV-B receptor-usage phenotype, we
conducted a viral interference assay using pseudotype viruses. Four
of these (MZ40-5B, FO36-5B, IT38-5RC and WY24-1RC) were
able to infect AH927 cells, and we tested whether they could also
infect AH927/FeLV-A cells, AH927/FeLV-B cells and AH927/
FeLV-C cells. As shown in Table 4, MZ40-5B and FO36-5B
isolates could not infect AH927/FeLV-B cells, but were able to
infect AH927/FeLV-A and AH927/FeLV-C cells, indicating that
these two viruses belong to the FeLV-B receptor-usage subgroup.
On the other hand, IT38-5RC and WY24-1RC isolates (which
contain enFeLV sequences in the TM region and/or the C-
domain) were unable to infect AH927/FeLV-A cells, but could
infect AH927/FeLV-B and AH927/FeLV-C cells. These isolates
must thus belong to the FeLV-A subgroup despite the fact that
they are clearly recombinant in nature.
Analysis of Deletion Mutants of the env Gene
In samples from 18 cats, several smaller fragments were
amplified by primer pairs Fe-8S/Fe-4S and Fe-3R, and were
cloned and sequenced. Deletion regions within these env gene
sequences were determined by comparison with full-length env
sequences isolated from the same individual cats. The 59 and 39
positions of deleted regions were shown on the FeLV-A 61E env
sequence (Fig. 6A), and several deletion patterns were evident from
these plots. Multiple mutant sequences were isolated from one
particular cat (MZ29), each with a different region deleted
(Fig. 6B), but these sequences were all very similar to the non-
mutated MZ29 env gene, suggesting that the various deletions
could have occurred de novo in this particular cat. Furthermore, in
the case of NR9 (see Fig. S3A), one deletion mutant of the env gene
was isolated that had an inversion of 95-bp in addition to its
deletion, and another that had a 95-bp inversion as well as an
insertion of 28-bp from the cat genome sequence (see NCBI
accession numbers ACBE0152516 and AANG01802278).
In addition to inversions and insertions, deletion mutants may
also contain enFeLV sequences acquired by recombination, as in
the case of ST17 (Fig. S3B). Overall, these results indicate that
deletion events within env genes may often occur de novo, and such
deletions contribute to the structural diversity of the FeLV env
gene.
Analysis of Structural Diversity in Small Regions of the
env Gene
All known full-length env genes observed in other countries
belong to the GIII group and are 1929 bp in length, whilst FeLV
env genes isolated from Japanese cats are variable in size. The env
genes from GI/Clade1 are generally 1938 bp in length and env
genes from GI/Clade2 and GI/Clade3 are typically 1932 bp in
length. We searched for defining sequence characteristics for the
various genotype and clade groupings, and found a 3-bp insertion
(AGT/AAT) (Fig. 7A, box a) in the FeLV env gene of most
Genotype I sequences, between positions 807 and 808 of the
FeLV-A 61E sequence (Genotype III). This is absent from
Genotypes II and III, and from the GM35 FeLV env sequence
(genotype unclassified), so it seems logical to assume that the
insertion must have originated in the common ancestor of
Genotype I. Some clones from GI/4 have a 12-bp insertion
(AATACAAGCAGT) between positions 798 and 799 of the

(CCCCAC) is present in isolates from TY24 and TY10, between
positions 827 and 828 of the FeLV-A 61E sequence (Fig. 7A, box
c), and a 6-bp insertion (ACTACT) is present in some GI/1
isolates between positions 528 and 529 of the FeLV-A 61E
sequence (Fig. 7B, box d). Some GI/5 isolates include a 6-bp
insertion (CAGGGC) between positions 534 and 535 of the FeLV-
A 61E sequence (Fig. 7B, box e), whilst others have a 3-bp deletion
(AAT) encompassing positions 535–537 of the FeLV-A 61E
sequence (Fig. 7B, box f). In Genotype II, FeLVs from cats AT34
and AT37 have a 3-bp insertion (CTT) between positions 214 and
215 of the FeLV-A 61E sequence (Fig. 7C, box g). The location on
the phylogenetic map (indicated as a and d in Fig. 7D, b,c,e and f
in Fig. 7E, and g in Fig. 7F) of these small structural changes in the
env gene of exogenous FeLVs indicates that these genetic traits
were established in viruses and transmitted to cats via viral
infection.
Discussion and Conclusion
FeLV infection in Japan is frequently observed amongst cats
that are free to venture outside. It has been shown that FeLV
transmission is related to close contact between cats, such as
mutual grooming or sharing food or water containers. The
incidence of FeLV infection is clearly dependent in part on the
region, indicating that infection may be associated with specific
habits or lifestyles of either (or both) the animals or the people.
The FeLV genome was detected in the PBMC of 77.7% of the
cats which tested positive for the FeLV antigen. Failure to amplify
viral sequences in the remainder of infected cats indicates a certain
level of inconsistency between the antigen-screening procedure
and our PCR-based method. Although nested PCR amplification
was carried out in these samples, we did not detect any viral
genome. PBMCs infected with FeLV may not always be
circulating or present in the blood, even though the cats show
viremia. It may depend on the timing of collecting the blood from
the cats. It has been reported that in domestic cats with FeLV-
FAIDS, the virus variant FeLV/61C was mainly found in the
intestines and was not present in the bone marrow [7]. Thus,
different strains of the virus may target different cells or tissues,
and it would be informative to determine the copy number of
FeLV provirus in each tissue type in naturally infected cats. We
further established a PCR method for detecting FeLV-B. This
PCR method can be used as diagnostic test because the previous
studies reported higher incidence of the FeLV-B variant in cats
with malignant tumors or hematopoietic disorders [33], [63]. It
could be used to establish the clinical stage of such diseases.
One important goal of the present study was to use sequence
comparisons to investigate the structural and genetic diversity of
FeLV env genes derived from cats that had been naturally infected
with FeLV. We have previously determined the nucleotide
sequences of two Japanese FeLV strains: FeLV-A clone33 isolated
from cats with AML, and pJ7E2 isolated from cats with thymic
lymphoma. On the basis of sequence homology, these env
sequences were highly divergent from FeLV-A Glasgow-1 and
FeLV-A 61E sequences, which prompted us to investigate the
genetic diversity of the FeLV env gene in detail. This is the first
report of a comprehensive analysis of FeLV env genes isolated from
naturally infected cats.
The strongly supported phylogenetic structuring of the FeLV
sequences analyzed in this study was unexpected. We identified
three major genotypic groups, GI (containing clades 1–7), GII,
and GIII (containing clades 1–2), and we found that most FeLV
strains in Japan are highly associated with geographical distribu-
tion, while GI/3, GI/4 and GI5 are strongly associated. It is thus
possible that these FeLV strains may have arisen by isolation in
Figure 6. FeLV env gene mutants. (A) The start (59 breakpoint) and end (39 breakpoint) positions of segments deleted from env genes are

their respective areas of occurrence over a long period of time,
producing a clear phylogenetic structure consistent with geo-
graphic distribution. Japanese FeLV strains are genetically distinct
from variants of the virus occurring in other parts of the world,
and have apparently originated and diversified within Japan.
Detection of the GI/Clade 1 genotype in the geographically
disjunct Kyoto, Wakayama and Oita prefectures, and detection of
the GI/Clade2 genotype in the Kagoshima prefecture (geograph-
ically distant from other populations of this clade) are thought to
be due to anthropogenic translocation of infected cats. With the
exception of a single cat from Okinawa, FeLV sequences
belonging to the GIII group were not detected in Japan, indicating
that the GI and GII groupings are likely to be the dominant virus
genotypes present in Japanese domestic cats. In a study of
purifying selection, we did not observe significant branch-specific
positive selection in Japanese FeLV strains, suggesting that
adaptive evolutionary change (driven by variation in host cats,
extrinsic environmental pressures, etc.) is an unlikely explanation
for the observed variation in the viral env gene. In addition, there is
no evidence that genetic diversification has led to altered receptor
usage in the various strains comprising the FeLV Genotype I
grouping; most epidemic FeLV strains analyzed in this study
appear to belong to the FeLV-A receptor subgroup, which is thus
the most prevalent subgroup among Japanese cats. In addition to
genetic diversity, substantial structural diversity of the FeLV env
gene was detected in our samples, including insertions, deletions,
inversions and recombination. Similar types of structural diversity
in the env gene (point mutations, insertions, deletions and
recombination) were observed in cats that had been experimen-
tally infected with FeLV [64]. Several FeLV env recombinants
have also been reported in cats with naturally occurring
lymphomas [33]. Retroviral recombination, such as transduction
of cellular oncogenes and circulating recombinant forms (CRF),
has been reported to involve ‘copy-choice’ or ‘template switching’
via formation of heteroduplexes of the viral RNA genome during
reverse transcription [65], [66]. The endogenous FeLV env gene is
expressed in normal cat lymphoid organs and FeLV-negative
lymphomas [59], [67]. Therefore, exogenous FeLV infections
involving these organs may expedite FeLV recombination.
Analysis of recombination between exogenous and endogenous
FeLVs revealed several recombination hot-spots on the env gene
(areas in which multiple recombination breakpoints coincide);
recombination tends to occur preferentially in regions of high
homology between exogenous and endogenous FeLV sequences.
In contrast, whilst deletion events also appear to be relatively
common in FeLV strains, there may be fewer constraints on the
locations of these deletions and therefore no pronounced hot-spots
of deletion breakpoints on env gene sequences. Overall, the
combined effect of recombination, insertion and deletion events is
likely to result in a proliferation of structural diversity in the FeLV
env gene.
In this study we found some unique recombinant env genes that
contain both VRA and VRB regions derived from the endogenous
FeLV env gene. Particular recombination patterns in env genes as
well as point mutations affecting the SPHQ motif of the Env
protein can alter viral infectivity and cell type specificity of viruses.
For example, we confirmed that certain recombinant FeLV strains
belong to receptor subgroups FeLV-B or FeLV-T instead of the
more common FeLV-A subgroup. The SPHQ motif is highly
conserved within the genus Gammaretrovirus and has been identified
as an important determinant for mediating fusion events during
virus entry into host cells [68], [69]. The FeLV-T receptor
subgroup has a particular mutation (H6P) within the SPHQ motif,
and this subgroup has been shown to possess unique receptor
usage, involving Pit1 and FeLIX [17]. Eighteen FeLV env clones
with mutations in the SPHQ motif were isolated from 11 samples,
suggesting that the viruses belonging to the FeLV-T subgroup may
be relatively common in Japan and may arise de novo in individual
cats via mutation of FeLV-A viruses. These events are also likely to
amplify viral diversity. Overall in this study, we show that the
structural and genetic divergence of FeLV has probably been
brought about by substitution, deletion, insertion, and recombi-
nation events within env genes, and these processes are thus likely
to be key drivers of FeLV evolution, especially in Japan. We have
identified structural and genetic diversity of FeLV env genes that
may provide new insights into the prevention of FeLV infection,
development of more effective vaccines, the geographical compo-
nents of FeLV infection, and the evolutionary dynamics of the
virus. Furthermore, in keeping with our division of FeLV samples
into three major genotype groups and several cohesive clades
within these groups, we propose that phylogenetic relationships be
used as one of the methods of viral classification.

(C-terminal domain). (A) Three clones (NR9-7, NR9-2SH and
NR9-4SH) were isolated from cat NR9, and NR9-2SH and NR9-
4SH had small inverted sequences (95 bp; pale gray) in addition to
1 kbp deletions. Isolate NR9-4SH also had very small inserted
sequence (28 bp; black) which may be originated from a part of cat
genomic sequence. (B) Two isolates from cat ST17 had FeLV-B-
like recombination as well as deletion. enFeLV derived sequence
