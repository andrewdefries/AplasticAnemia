Introduction
Telomeres, which are composed of tandem repeats of the
TTAGGG sequence and associated proteins, are nucleoprotein
structures that cap the ends of chromosomes (for reviews see
Blackburn, 2001; Chan and Blackburn, 2002; de Lange, 2005).
Telomere length is maintained by telomerase, a reverse tran-
scriptase that counteracts telomere shortening associated with
cell division by de novo addition of telomere repeats onto chro-
mosome ends (for review see Chan and Blackburn, 2002).
Telomerase is expressed in the stem cell compartment of several
adult tissues, where it is thought to compensate for telomere
shortening associated with cell proliferation and tissue regenera-
tion (for reviews see Collins and Mitchell, 2002; Harrington,
2004; Flores et al., 2005, 2006; Sarin et al., 2005). Interestingly,
telomerase activity levels are not sufficient to maintain telomere
length during human aging, and telomeres progressively shorten
with increasing age in the context of the organism (Harley et al.,
1990; Canela et al., 2007; for review see Blasco, 2005) and are
also associated with different disease states (Samani et al., 2001;
Wiemann et al., 2002; Cawthon et al., 2003; Epel et al., 2004;
Valdes et al., 2005). Indeed, telomerase levels in humans and
mice are thought to be rate limiting for organismal life span.
In particular, reduced telomerase activity caused by mutations in
telomerase components in the human diseases dyskeratosis con-
genita (Mitchell et al., 1999; Vulliamy et al., 2001, 2004; Mason
et al., 2005), aplastic anemia (Marrone et al., 2004; Yamaguchi
et al., 2005), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Armanios et al.,
2007; Tsakiri et al., 2007) leads to accelerated telomere shortening,
premature loss of tissue regeneration, and premature death. Some
of these phenotypes are shared by telomerase-deficient mice
(Terc−/−
mice; Blasco et al., 1997), which show a reduction in
both the median and the maximum life span already within the
first mouse generation (García-Cao et al., 2006). Furthermore,
these defects are anticipated with subsequent Terc−/−
mouse gener-
ations with progressively shorter telomeres concomitant with pre-
mature loss of tissue regeneration and organismal survival (Lee
et al., 1998; Herrera et al., 1999; Leri et al., 2003; Flores et al.,
2005; García-Cao et al., 2006). Similarly, disease anticipation has
also been reported with increasing generations of human dyskera-
tosis congenita patients (Vulliamy et al., 2004).
The telomerase-deficient mouse model has been instru-
mental in understanding the effects of telomere shortening on
stem cell biology (for review see Blasco, 2005). In particular,
we recently showed that telomere shortening results in an im-
paired capacity of hair follicle (HF) stem cells to regenerate the
hair and the skin because of a defective mobilization of the HF
stem cells out of their niche (Flores et al., 2005). This defective
stem cell behavior anticipates the fact that telomerase-deficient
mice show premature skin-aging phenotypes such as decreased

O
rgan homeostasis and organismal survival are
related to the ability of stem cells to sustain tissue
regeneration. As a consequence of accelerated
telomerase shortening, telomerase-deﬁcient mice show de-
fective tissue regeneration and premature death. This suggests
a direct impact of telomere length and telomerase activity
on stem cell biology. We recently found that short telo-
meres impair the ability of epidermal stem cells to mobilize
out of the hair follicle (HF) niche, resulting in impaired
skin and hair growth and in the suppression of epidermal
stem cell proliferative capacity in vitro. Here, we demonstrate
that telomerase reintroduction in mice with critically short
telomeres is sufﬁcient to correct epidermal HF stem cell
defects. Additionally, telomerase reintroduction into these
mice results in a normal life span by preventing degenerative
pathologies in the absence of increased tumorigenesis.

wound healing, hair loss, and hair graying (Lee et al., 1998;
Herrera et al., 1999; Rudolph et al., 1999), as well as decreased
skin cancer, as indicated by the fact that they are resistant to
skin carcinogenesis protocols (Gonzalez-Suarez et al., 2000).
These findings suggested that the progressive telomere shorten-
ing that occurs in human tissues with increasing age might di-
rectly impact the ability of different adult stem cell populations
to maintain tissue homeostasis. Furthermore, these results opened
the possibility that restoration of telomerase activity may be
sufficient to correct stem cell defects associated with short telo-
meres and to extend the organismal life span.
Here, we demonstrate that restoration of a copy of the
Terc gene into late generation G3/G4 telomerase-deficient mice
is sufficient to elongate critically short telomeres in skin kerati-
nocytes from these mice, prevent end-to-end chromosome fu-
sions, and rescue both HF stem cell defects in vivo and the
impaired proliferative capacity of epidermal stem cells ex vivo.
Finally, telomerase reintroduction was able to extend the nor-
mal life span of G4 telomerase-deficient mice by preventing de-
generative pathologies in the absence of increased cancer. These
findings support the notion that telomerase activators would be
sufficient to correct stem cell defects in tissues with critically
short telomeres in the absence of undesired effects.
Results
Reintroduction of the telomerase Terc gene
in late generation Terc-deﬁcient mice is
sufﬁcient to elongate critically short
telomeres and prevent chromosomal
instability in skin keratinocytes
To test whether telomerase reintroduction was able to elongate
short telomeres in skin keratinocytes from late generation G3/G4
Terc-deficient mice, we first generated large colonies of litter-
mate mice from Terc+/−
× G2/G3 Terc−/−
intercrosses (Materials
and methods). The progeny of these crosses was divided into
two mouse cohorts according to their telomerase status: G3/G4
Terc−/−
telomerase-deficient mice and G3/G4 Terc+/−
telomerase-
reconstituted mice (referred to here as G3/G4 Terc+/−*
mice).
Importantly, both mouse cohorts inherited the same telomere
length from the parents; however, G3/G4 Terc−/−
mice lack
telomerase activity and G3/G4 Terc+/−*
mice are telomerase
proficient (Fig. 1). To address whether telomerase activity in
G3 Terc+/−*
mice was able to rescue short telomeres compared
with G3 Terc−/−
cohorts, we measured telomere length using
quantitative FISH (Q-FISH) on primary keratinocytes obtained
from newborn mice (Gonzalez-Suarez et al., 2000; Muñoz et al.,
2005; Materials and methods). G3 Terc+/−*
skin keratinocytes
showed, on average, longer telomeres than those from the corre-
sponding G3 Terc−/−
littermates (P < 0.001; Fig. 2, A and B).
Furthermore, this telomere elongation coincided with a signifi-
cant reduction of the percentage of short telomeres (<100 arbi-
trary units of fluorescence [a.u.f.]) in G3 Terc+/−*
mice compared
with the corresponding G3 Terc−/−
littermates (P < 0.001; Fig. 2,
A and B), which is in agreement with previous findings showing
that telomerase preferentially elongates short telomeres both in
yeast and mammals (Hemann et al., 2001; Samper et al., 2001;
Teixeira et al., 2004). The percentage of longest telomeres
(>1,000 a.u.f.) was also significantly increased in telomerase-
reconstituted G3 Terc+/−*
mice compared with the corresponding
G3 Terc−/−
littermates (P = 0.015; Fig. 2,A and B), in agreement
with the increase in mean telomere length.
Finally, we determined whether the elongated telomeres
in G3 Terc+/−*
keratinocytes correlated with a significant rescue
of chromosomal aberrations associated with critically short
telomeres. For this, we performed a full karyotypic analysis

constituted in two independent MEF cultures

centration used is indicated on top of each lane.

using telomere Q-FISH on metaphases (Materials and methods).
As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), telomerase-reconstituted G3
Terc+/−*
keratinocytes showed a significant rescue of chromo-
somal abnormalities associated with critically short telomeres,
such as signal-free ends and end-to-end fusions, compared with
the corresponding G3 Terc−/−
controls (P < 0.001 for all com-
parisons), suggesting that these types of aberrations are the di-
rect consequence of critical telomere shortening and that when
short telomeres are reelongated by telomerase they are com-
pletely prevented. In contrast, breaks and fragments are not res-
cued by telomerase reintroduction, indicating that they are not
the direct consequence of critical telomere shortening.
Reintroduction of the telomerase Terc gene
into G3/G4 Terc-deﬁcient mice is sufﬁcient
to rescue mobilization defects of epidermal
HF stem cells
To investigate whether elongation of short telomeres by telomer-
ase in skin keratinocytes was sufficient to rescue epidermal stem
cell defects in late generation telomerase-deficient mice (Flores
et al., 2005), we compared the number and mobilization ability
of epidermal stem cells in the HF stem cell niche before and after
mitogenic activation in G3 Terc+/−*
mice with that of the corre-
sponding G3 Terc−/−
littermates (Fig. 4, A–C). To visualize HF
stem cells, we used a labeling technique previously shown to
mark self-renewing and multipotent epidermal cells, the so-called
label retaining cells (LRCs; for review see Fuchs et al., 2004;
Flores et al., 2005; Moore and Lemischka, 2006). Of notice, these
experiments were performed in young mice (0–2 mo old) from
both genotypes before any skin phenotypes associated with short
telomeres were detectable. Confocal microscopy revealed that
LRCs are enriched at the bulge area of the HF in the two geno-
types, which is in agreement with the known location of the
HF stem cell niche (Fig. 4 C; Cotsarelis et al., 1990; Oshima
et al., 2001; Morris et al., 2004; Tumbar et al., 2004).
In control resting skin conditions, we did not detect sig-
nificant differences in the numbers of LRCs at the hair bulge of
G3 Terc+/−*
mice compared with the corresponding G3 Terc−/−
littermates (P = 0.090; Fig. 4, A and C). To test whether the hair
bulge stem cells were able to mobilize (exit their quiescence
state and migrate) out of the niche, we studied the response of
G3 Terc−/−
and G3 Terc+/−*
LRCs to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-
13-acetate (TPA) treatment, a potent tumor promoter that ac-
tivates LRCs to give numerous progeny (Flores et al., 2005).

increase in the percentage of long telomeres. Data are mean values ± SEM for three independent pairs of G3 Terc−/−

TPA treatment results in rapid disappearance of LRCs (Braun
et al., 2003), skin hyperplasia (Gonzalez-Suarez et al., 2000),
and entry of HFs into their anagen (growing) phase (Wilson et al.,
1994). After TPA treatment, only 34% of the LRCs mobilized
out of the HF niche in G3 Terc−/−
mice (Fig. 4, B and C) com-
pared with the previously reported 70% mobilization in wild-
type mice of different genetic backgrounds (Flores et al., 2005),
thus confirming the defective stem cell mobilization associated
with short telomeres. In contrast, 65% of LRCs mobilized in
TPA-treated G3 Terc+/−*
mice (P = 0.006; Fig. 4 B). A similar
rescue in HF stem cell mobilization defects was obtained when
comparing G4 Terc+/−*
mice to the corresponding G4 Terc−/−
littermates (Fig. S1, A–C, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/
content/full/jcb.200704141/DC1). Collectively, these results
demonstrate that telomerase reintroduction in late generation
G3 and G4 Terc+/−*
mice significantly rescues epidermal HF

stem cell mobilization defects compared with the G3 and G4
Terc−/−
littermates.
In agreement with the defects in HF stem cell mobilization
associated with short telomeres, HF length was not significantly
increased in G3 Terc−/−
mice after TPA treatment (P = 0.80;
Fig. 4, D, E, and H), reflecting a defective HF anagen response in
these mice after TPA treatment (Flores et al., 2005).Again, telom-
erase reintroduction rescued this defect in G3 Terc+/−*
littermates,
where HF length was significantly increased in response to TPA
treatment compared with resting nontreated skin (P < 0.001; Fig. 4,
D, E, and H), suggesting that telomerase is sufficient to restitute
skin homeostasis in these mice. Similar results were obtained for
increased interfollicular epidermis (IFE) thickness in response to
TPA treatment. Again, telomerase reintroduction in G3 Terc+/−*
littermates resulted in increased IFE hyperplasia compared
with littermate G3 Terc−/−
mice in response to TPA treatment
(P < 0.05; Fig. 4, F–H). To study whether the increased IFE hyper-
plasia in G3 Terc+/−*
mice compared with the G3 Terc−/−
controls
was associated with significant differences in cell proliferation or
apoptosis, we performed immunohistochemistry of skin sections
with antibodies against Ki67 and caspase 3 to detect prolifera-
ting and apoptotic cells, respectively (Materials and methods).
As shown in Fig. S2 (available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/
full/jcb.200704141/DC1), we did not detect considerable differ-
encesinthepercentageofKi67-positivecellsbetweenG3Terc+/−*
and G3 Terc−/−
either in resting skin conditions or upon TPA treat-
ment. Similarly, we were unable to detect caspase 3–positive cells
in the skin of G3 Terc+/−*
and G3 Terc−/−
mice, suggesting that
apoptosis is not a major cellular response to critically short telo-
meres in the skin (Fig. S3). Finally, we studied whether there were
differences in skin differentiation markers between G3 Terc+/−*
and G3 Terc−/−
mice by performing immunohistochemistry with
antibodies against K14 and p63, two skin basal-layer markers
whose expression is normally reduced at the suprabasal skin lay-
ers (Materials and methods). We could not detect significant dif-
ferences in the percentage of cells or in the number of keratinocyte
layers positive for these markers (Figs. S4 and S5).
Next, we used hair-plucking experiments as an indepen-
dent way to induce entry of HFs into their anagen phase (Flores
et al., 2005; Materials and methods). In control resting skin
conditions, we did not detect differences in back skin HF length
and dermis thickness between G3 Terc−/−
and G3 Terc+/−*
littermates (P = 0.71 and P = 0.49, respectively; Fig. 5, A, C,
and E). Upon hair plucking, however, G3 Terc+/−*
mice showed
a significantly increased back skin HF length and dermis thick-
ness compared with the corresponding G3 Terc−/−
littermates
(P = 0.04 and P = 0.09, respectively; Fig. 5, A–E), again
demonstrating that telomerase reintroduction in mice with short
telomeres is able to improve the ability of epidermal HF stem
cells to mobilize and regenerate the hair and skin.
Rescue of proliferative potential of
epidermal stem cells ex vivo in late
generation telomerase-reconstituted
G3 Terc+/−*
mice
It has been previously described that the epidermal stem cell de-
fects observed in late generation telomerase-deficient mice are cell
autonomous, as indicated by a defective clonogenic potential of
these cells ex vivo (Flores et al., 2006). Individual colonies in clono-
genic assays have been proposed to derive from single stem cells
(Barrandon and Green, 1987; Materials and methods). Here, we
performed clonogenic assays to compare the proliferation potential
of telomerase-deficient G3 Terc−/−
and telomerase-reconstituted
G3 Terc+/−*
epidermal stem cells (Materials and methods).
In agreement with the in vivo results shown in Fig. 4, primary
keratinocytes from newborn G3 Terc−/−
mice formed fewer and
smaller colonies than those from wild-type controls (P < 0.001;
Fig. 6, A and B), reflecting the previously described defective
capacity of late generation Terc-null epidermal stem cells to pro-
liferate ex vivo (Flores et al., 2005). Interestingly, the defective
clonogenic potential of these cells was significantly corrected in
telomerase-reconstituted G3 Terc+/−*
keratinocytes compared
with the corresponding G3 Terc−/−
controls (P = 0.006; Fig. 6,
A and B), demonstrating that telomerase reintroduction amelio-
rates the ex vivo proliferative capacity of epidermal stem cells
from late generation telomerase-deficient mice.
Reintroduction of the telomerase Terc gene
in G3 Terc-deﬁcient mice is sufﬁcient to
rescue their small body-size phenotype
We have previously described that late generation telomerase-
deficient mice show a small body-size phenotype at the time of
birth, which is associated with shorter telomeres in these mice as
well as with a decreased clonogenic potential of epidermal stem
cells in vitro (Flores et al., 2005). These observations opened the
intriguing possibility that body size and stem cell proliferative
potential may be mechanistically related. Here, we first con-
firmed that newborn G3 Terc−/−
mice showed a significantly
lower body weight at the time of birth compared with the wild-
type controls (P < 0.001; Fig. 6, C and D, left), which again was
concomitant with a lower clonogenic potential of keratinocytes
derived from G3 Terc−/−
mice compared with the wild types
(Fig. 6, A and B). Interestingly, the small body-size phenotype
of newborn G3 Terc−/−
mice was significantly corrected by
telomerase reintroduction into G3 Terc+/−*
newborns, parallel-
ing the rescue of stem cell phenotypes in these mice (Figs. 4–6).
This significant rescue of the small body-size phenotype observed
in newborns was maintained when comparing age-matched adult
(2 mo old) G3 Terc+/−*
mice to the corresponding G3 Terc−/−
littermates (P < 0.001; Fig. 6, C and D, right). These results
support that the small body size of telomerase-deficient mice
may be linked to decreased stem cell functionality.
Reintroduction of the telomerase Terc gene
in G3 Terc-deﬁcient mice is sufﬁcient to
rescue a normal life span in the absence of
increased cancer
The results presented here for epidermal HF stem cells open the
possibility that telomerase reintroduction into mice with criti-
cally short telomeres may be sufficient to restore stem cell
functionality in different tissues, thus rescuing life span and
long-term survival. To address this, we studied the long-term
survival and maximum life span of both telomerase-reconstituted
G4 Terc+/−*
and telomerase-deficient G4 Terc−/−
littermates,
TELOMERASE RESCUES STEM CELL DEFECTS • SIEGL-CACHEDENIER ET AL. 283
compared with that of control wild-type mice as well as control
nonreconstituted heterozygous Terc+/−
mice (Fig. 7, A–C).
First, we confirmed a dramatic decrease in the maximum life
span of G4 Terc−/−
mice compared with wild-type and Terc+/−
controls, which went from ‫031ف‬ and 140 wk, respectively, to
<50 wk in the case of G4 Terc−/−
mice (P < 0.001; Fig. 7 A).
G4 Terc−/−
mice also showed a significantly decreased median
survival compared with the wild-type and Terc+/−
controls
(P < 0.001; Fig. 7 B). Importantly, telomerase-reconstituted
G4 Terc+/−*
mice showed a survival curve and a median
survival that is indistinguishable from that of wild-type and
Terc+/−
controls (Fig. 7, A and B, NS; P = . 0.56), indicating

heterozygous mice. Telomerase-deficient G3 and G4 Terc−/−
mice
have a dramatic reduction in the incidence of malignant tumors
compared with wild-type and normal Terc+/−

mice (Fig. 7 D), which is in agreement with a potent tumor
suppressor role for short telomeres in the context of telomerase
deficiency (Greenberg et al., 1999; Gonzalez-Suarez et al., 2000;

death (lymphomas, sarcomas, and carcinomas) compared with that
of wild-type and Terc+/−
heterozygous controls, respectively
(Fig. 7 D), suggesting that telomerase reintroduction is sufficient
to sustain normal tumorigenesis in G4 Terc+/−*
mice. Of notice,
the increased tumorigenesis in G4 Terc+/−*
mice compared
with nonreconstituted Terc+/−
heterozygous controls (P < 0.001;
Fig. 7 D) may be related to the fact that not all chromosomal
defects associated with short telomeres are rescued by telomerase
reintroduction (i.e., fragments and breaks; Fig. 3).
Finally, telomerase-reconstituted G4 Terc+/−*
mice also
showed a significant rescue of degenerative pathologies com-
pared with G3 and G4 Terc−/−
mice. In particular, atrophies of
the small intestine appeared in only 6% of G4 Terc+/−*
mice at
time of death compared with 100% of the G3 and G4 Terc−/−
mice (Fig. 7 E). Importantly, degenerative pathologies in G4
Terc+/−*
mice showed a similar incidence to those of aged-
matched normal Terc+/−
controls with a similar dose of the Terc
allele, illustrating a complete rescue of degenerative patholo-
gies associated with late generation Terc−/−
mice. Collectively,
these results suggest that telomerase reconstitution into mice
with critically short telomeres is sufficient to confer a normal
life span and normal aging in the absence of abnormally in-
creased tumorigenesis.
Finally, in agreement with the similar incidence of de-
generative pathologies and cancer, mean telomere length, as well
as the percentages of short and long telomeres, was indistin-
guishable between telomerase-reconstituted G3/G4 Terc+/−*
mice
and the Terc+/−
controls in both age-matched adult skin kerati-
nocytes (10 mo old; Fig. 8, A and B) and primary splenocytes
(12–24 mo old; Fig. 8, C and D), suggesting that telomerase
activity with a normal telomere length is able to provide homeo-
stasis during the life span of these mice.
Discussion
The mechanisms by which short telomeres negatively impact
on organismal aging and life span are still far from being under-
stood. One of the proposed mechanisms, which has gained in-
creasing experimental support, is the progressive loss of stem
cell functionality associated with critically short telomeres.
Evidence for this comes from the study of the telomerase-deficient
mouse model, which shows impaired stem cell functionality in
several tissues including the bone marrow, the brain, and the skin
(Lee et al., 1998; Samper et al., 2002; Ferron et al., 2004; Flores
et al., 2005). In particular, we have recently shown that late
generation telomerase-deficient mice show an impaired ability of
epidermal stem cells to mobilize out of their niches and to regen-
erate the skin and the hair. This defective stem cell behavior
anticipates the fact that telomerase-deficient mice show premature
aging of the hair and the skin as well as an increased resistance
to developing skin cancer (Lee et al., 1998; Herrera et al., 1999;
Rudolph et al., 1999; Gonzalez-Suarez et al., 2000), supporting
the notion that short telomeres provoke aging by impairing the
functionality of stem cells.
Here, we provide further support for a stem cell theory of
telomere-mediated aging by showing that telomerase reintroduc-
tion in late generation telomerase-deficient mice is sufficient to
restore a normal behavior of epidermal HF stem cells and a nor-
mal skin functionality in these mice, therefore supporting the
notion that stem cells are important players in the known role of
telomeres and telomerase in aging. In this regard, we show that
epidermal HF stem cell defects of late-generation Terc-deficient
mice are independent of proliferation rates, apoptosis, or ex-
pression of the K14 and p63 differentiation markers in the skin,
similar to Terc−/−
and Terc+/−*
mice. Indeed, the defective mobi-
lization ability of epidermal HF stem cells anticipates the
premature skin aging phenotypes of these Terc-deficient mice.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that telomerase reconstitution in the
context of very short telomeres not only corrects epidermal HF
stem cell defects in newborn mice but is also sufficient to sustain
a long-term normal organismal life span in these mice by pre-
venting organismal aging in the absence of increased cancer. It is
important to highlight that telomerase-reconstituted mice show a
telomere length that is indistinguishable from that of normal,
nonreconstituted, Terc heterozygous mice, indicating that telom-
erase activity not only elongates short telomeres but is able to
restitute a normal telomere-length homeostasis during the life
span of these mice.
Finally, these observations support the idea that therapies
based on telomerase activation may be effective in correcting
the proaging effects of short telomeres in the absence of in-
creased risk of carcinogenesis. This is of particular relevance in
the case of premature aging diseases characterized by decreased
levels of telomerase activity and shorter telomeres, such as some
cases of dyskeratosis congenita and aplastic anemia, which result
in premature death associated with a defective tissue renewal
capacity (bone marrow and skin) and increased cancer (Mason
et al., 2005).

facilitate visualization of short (<10 Kb) and long (>50 Kb) telomeres. The total number of individual telomeres used for the quantiﬁcation and the percentage

Materials and methods
Generation and genotyping of mice
To generate littermate G3/G4 Terc+/−*
and G3/G4 Terc−/−
mice, G2/G3
Terc−/−
males were crossed with Terc+/−
females (Blasco et al., 1997).
Genotyping was performed as described in Blasco et al. (1997). Note that
littermate G3/G4 Terc+/−*
and G3/G4 Terc−/−
mice are of an exact genetic
background (C57BL6) as if they were derived from the same parents.
Mouse handling
Mouse colonies were generated in a pure C57BL6 background and main-
tained at the Spanish National Cancer Center under speciﬁc pathogen-free
conditions in accordance with the recommendations of the Federation of
European Laboratory Animal Science Associations.
Telomeric repeat ampliﬁcation protocol
Primary mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEFs) were trypsinized and washed
in PBS, and S-100 extracts were prepared as described in Blasco et al.
(1997). Three protein concentrations were used for each sample (5, 2, and
1 μg). Extension and ampliﬁcation reactions and electrophoresis were
performed as described in Blasco et al. (1997). A negative control was in-
cluded by preincubating each MEF extract with RNase for 10 min at 30°C
before the extension reaction. An internal control for PCR efﬁciency was
included (TRAPeze kit; Oncor).
Treatment regimens
To induce LRC mobilization, IFE hyperplasia, and anagen entry, tail skin
from 71-d-old mice in the telogen (resting) phase of the hair cycle was topi-
cally treated every 48 h with TPA (20 nM in acetone) for a total of four
doses. The control mice were treated with acetone only. 24 h after the last
TPA treatment, mice were killed and the tail skin was analyzed. To induce
anagen by physical stimulation, dorsal HFs in the telogen phase of the hair
cycle were plucked from the back skin of 60-d-old G3 Terc+/−*
mice and
the corresponding G3 Terc−/−
controls. 10 d after plucking, dorsal skins
were harvested and prepared for histology.
Labeling of LRCs
LRCs were obtained as described in Bickenbach et al. (1986), Cotsarelis
et al. (1990), and Braun et al. (2003), with some modiﬁcations. In brief,
litters of neonatal mice were injected with 50 mg/kg of bodyweight BrdU
(Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in PBS. Each animal received a daily injection be-
ginning at day 4 of life for a total of 5 d. After the labeling period, mice
were allowed to grow for 60 d before the initiation of any treatment. Cells
retaining the label at the end of the treatment were identiﬁed as LRCs.
Preparation of whole mounts
Whole mounts of mouse tail epidermis were prepared as previously de-
scribed in Braun et al. (2003). In brief, after mice were killed with CO2 and
their tails were amputated, skin was peeled from the tails and incubated in
5 mM EDTA in PBS at 37°C for 4 h. Using forceps, intact sheets of epider-
mis were separated from the dermis and ﬁxed in neutral-buffered formalin
for 2 h at room temperature. Fixed epidermal sheets were maintained in
PBS containing 0.2% sodium azide at 4°C before labeling.
Immunoﬂuorescence of epidermal sheets
To detect LRCs in whole mounts of the tail skin, ﬁxed epidermal sheets were
blocked and permeabilized by incubation for 30 min in a modiﬁed phos-
phate buffer (Braun et al., 2003) containing 0.5% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-
100 in TBS. Subsequently, epidermal sheets were immersed for 30 min in
2 M HCl at 37°C, incubated overnight with a mouse anti-BrdU antibody
conjugated with ﬂuorescein (Roche) at 1:50 in modiﬁed PB buffer, washed
four times in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20, and mounted in Vectashield
(Vector Laboratories).
Confocal microscopy
A laser scanning confocal microscope (TCS-SP2-AOBS; Leica) was used to
obtain ﬂuorescence images. Image stacks of 60–80 μm were obtained
through the z dimension at steps 1.0 μm apart, using a PL APO 20×/0.70
PH2 (Leica) as lens. Maximum intensity projections of the image stacks
were then generated using LCS Software (Leica).
Pathology analyses
Mice were killed when they showed signs of poor health, such as reduced
activity or weight loss, and subjected to exhaustive histopathological analysis.
The organs we analyzed for age-related degenerative pathologies were
the intestine (atrophy of the small and large intestine), kidney (glomerulo-
nephritis and tubular degeneration), spleen (atrophy, hemosiderosis, and
myeloid and lymphoid hyperplasia), liver (congestion, vacuolar degeneration,
microgranuloma, and steatosis), testis (atrophy and ectasis of seminal
vesicles), ovary (atrophy), uterus (cystic endometrial hyperplasia), skin (benign
hyperplasia), lung (congestion), heart (congestion and cardiomyopathy),
and brain (calciﬁcation).
Histology and immunohistochemistry of skin
Tail or back skin samples were harvested from mice and ﬁxed overnight in
neutral-buffered formalin at 4°C, dehydrated through graded alcohols and
xylene, and embedded in parafﬁn. For determination of IFE thickness, der-
mis thickness, and HF length, dissected skin was cut parallel to the spine
and sections were cut perpendicular to the skin surface to obtain longitudi-
nal HF sections. 5-μM sections were used for hematoxylin-eosin staining.
For immunohistochemistry, tail skin samples were sectioned at 2–3 μm
and processed with 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.5, cooked under pres-
sure for 2 min. Slides were washed in water, and then in TBS Tween 20
0.5%, blocked with peroxidase, washed with TBS Tween 20 0.5% again,
and blocked with FBS followed by another wash. The slides were incu-
bated with the primary antibodies: rabbit monoclonal to Ki-67 antibody
(prediluted; SP6; Master Diagnostica), rabbit polyclonal active caspase 3
at 1:200 (R&D Systems), mouse monoclonal p63 at 1:100 (clone A48,
Neomarker), or rabbit polyclonal K14 at 1:100 (Neomarker). Slides were
then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with peroxidase
(DakoCytomation), goat anti-rabbit (1:50) in the case of Ki-67, active
caspase 3, K14, and mouse on mouse (Vector Laboratories) in the case of
p63. For signal development, DAB (DakoCytomation) was used as a substrate.
Sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin and analyzed by
light microscopy.
Isolation of newborn keratinocytes
2-d-old mice were killed and soaked in betadine (5 min), in a PBS antibi-
otic solution (5 min), in 70% ethanol (5 min), and again in a PBS antibiotic
solution (5 min). Limbs and tail were amputated and the skin was peeled
off using forceps. Skins were then soaked in PBS (2 min), PBS antibiotic
solution (2 min), 70% ethanol (1 min), and again in PBS antibiotic solution
(2 min). Using forceps, each skin was ﬂoated on the surface of 1× trypsin
solution (4 ml on a 60-mm cell culture plate; Sigma-Aldrich) for 16 h at
4°C. Skins were transferred to a sterile surface. The epidermis was sepa-
rated from the dermis using forceps, minced, and stirred at 37°C for 30 min
in serum-free Cnt-02 medium (CELLnTEC Advanced Cell Systems AG). The cell
suspension was ﬁltered through a sterile Teﬂon mesh (Cell Strainer 0.7 m;
BD Biosciences) to remove corniﬁed sheets. Keratinocytes were then
collected by centrifugation (160 g) for 10 min and seeded on collagen
I–precoated cell culture plates (BD Biosciences).
Colony-forming assay and culture conditions
1,000 mouse keratinocytes per genotype were seeded onto 10 μg/ml
mitomycin C (2 h), treated with J2-3T3 ﬁbroblasts (105
per well, 6-well dishes),
and grown at 37°C/5% CO2 in Cnt-02 medium. After 10 d of cultivation,
dishes were rinsed twice with PBS, ﬁxed in 10% formaldehyde, and then
stained with 1% Rhodamine B to visualize colony formation. Colony size
and number were measured using three dishes per experiment.
Telomere length analysis by Q-FISH
Freshly isolated splenocytes were obtained by squeezing the spleen through
a cell strainer (70 μm; Nylon; BD Biosciences). Red cells were lysed by
osmotic shock, and the splenocytes were resuspended in RPMI 1640
containing 10% FBS and 0.55 μM β-mercaptoethanol. Concanavalin A
(Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a concentration of 5 μg/ml and splenocytes
were grown for 48 h. The cells were incubated with 0.1 μg/ml colcemide
(Invitrogen) for 2 h and ﬁxed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1). Q-FISH was
performed as described in Herrera et al. (1999) and Samper et al. (2000).
To correct for lamp intensity and alignment, images from FluoroSpheres
(ﬂuorescent beads; Invitrogen) were analyzed using the TFL-Telo software
(provided by P. Lansdorp, Terry Fox Laboratory, Vancouver, Canada). Telomere
ﬂuorescence values were extrapolated from the telomere ﬂuorescence of
lymphoma cell lines LY-R (R cells) and LY-S (S cells) with known telomere
lengths of 80 and 10 kb, respectively. There was a linear correlation (r2
=
0.999) between the ﬂuorescence intensity of the R and S telomeres. We re-
corded the images using a camera (CCK; COHU) on a ﬂuorescence micro-
scope (DMRb; Leica). A mercury vapor lamp (CS 100 W-2; Philips) was used
as a source. We captured the images using the Q-FISH software (Leica) in
a linear acquisition mode to prevent oversaturation of ﬂuorescence intensity.
TELOMERASE RESCUES STEM CELL DEFECTS • SIEGL-CACHEDENIER ET AL. 289
We used the TFL-Telo software (Zijlmans et al., 1997) to quantify the
ﬂuorescence intensity of telomeres from at least 10 metaphases for each
data point.
Exponentially growing primary keratinocytes were ﬁxed in methanol/
acetic acid, and Q-FISH of interphase nucleus was performed. For Q- FISH
in tail skin, parafﬁn-embedded tail sections were deparafﬁnated. Both ke-
ratinocytes and deparafﬁnated sections of tail skin were hybridized
with a PNA-telomeric probe and telomere ﬂuorescence was determined
as described in Gonzalez-Suarez et al. (2000) and Muñoz et al. (2005).
More than 60 nuclei from each mouse and condition were captured at 100
magniﬁcation using a microscope (CTR MIC; Leica) and a camera (High
Performance CCD; COHU). Telomere ﬂuorescence was integrated using
spot IOD analysis in the TFL-TELO program (Zijlmans et al., 1997).
Cytogenetic analysis using telomere Q-FISH on metaphases
Metaphases from keratinocytes of the indicated genotypes were obtained
by adding 1 μg/ml colcemide (Invitrogen) to primary keratinocytes during
5 h and then ﬁxing in methanol/acetic acid (3:1). Q-FISH was performed
as described in Herrera et al. (1999) and Samper et al. (2000). For analy-
sis of chromosomal aberrations, 50 metaphases per genotype were ana-
lyzed by superimposing the telomere image on the DAPI image using the
TFL-telo software.
Statistical analysis
Unless otherwise indicated, data are given as mean values ± SEM of
n and have been analyzed for statistically signiﬁcant differences using
t test.
