Summary
Aplastic anemia may be associated with persistent viral infections that result from failure of the
immune system to control virus. To evaluate the effects on hematopoiesis exerted by sustained
viral replication in the presence of activated T cells, blood values and bone marrow (BM) func-
tion were analyzed in chronic infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in
perforin-deficient (P0/0) mice. These mice exhibit a vigorous T cell response, but are unable to
eliminate the virus. Within 14 d after infection, a progressive pancytopenia developed that
eventually was lethal due to agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia correlating with an increas-
ing loss of morphologically differentiated, pluripotent, and committed progenitors in the BM.
This hematopoietic disease caused by a noncytopathic chronic virus infection was prevented by
depletion of CD8ϩ, but not of CD4ϩ, T cells and accelerated by increasing the frequency of
LCMV-specific CD8ϩ T cells in T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic (tg) mice. LCMV and
CD8ϩ T cells were found only transiently in the BM of infected wild-type mice. In contrast,
increased numbers of CD8ϩ T cells and LCMV persisted at high levels in antigen-presenting cells of
infected P0/0 and P0/0 ϫ TCR tg mice. No cognate interaction between the TCR and hematopoi-
etic progenitors presenting either LCMV-derived or self-antigens on the major histocompatibility
complex was found, but damage to hematopoiesis was due to excessive secretion and action of tu-
mor necrosis factor (TNF)/lymphotoxin (LT)-␣ and interferon (IFN)-␥ produced by CD8ϩ T
cells. This was studied in double-knockout mice that were genetically deficient in perforin and TNF
receptor type 1. Compared with P0/0 mice, these mice had identical T cell compartments and T cell
responses to LCMV, yet they survived LCMV infection and became life-long virus carriers. The
numbers of hematopoietic precursors in the BM were increased compared with P0/0 mice after
LCMV infection, although transient blood disease was still noticed. This residual disease activity was
found to depend on IFN-␥–producing LCMV-specific T cells and the time point of hematopoietic
recovery paralleled disappearance of these virus-specific, IFN-␥–producing CD8ϩ T cells. Thus, in
the absence of IFN-␥ and/or TNF/LT-␣, exhaustion of virus-specific T cells was not hampered.
Key words: aplastic anemia • lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus • cytotoxicT lymphocytes •
cytokines • immune tolerance
Sustained suppression and/or destruction of pluripotent
and committed hematopoietic precursors in the bone
marrow (BM)1 leads to aplastic anemia (AA) (1). Severely
impaired hematopoiesis in the BM and, as a consequence,
failure to produce mature blood cells, are usually fatal for
the host due to bacterial invasion or bleeding. Apart from

drugs and chemicals, host genes, autoimmune responses,
cytokines, and viruses have been implicated in the initia-
tion and progression of this disorder (for review see refer-
ence 2). Most of the known viruses causing human BM
failure tend to persistently infect the host and are non- or
poorly cytopathic for blood cell progenitors; therefore a
major role of destructive immunity in the pathogenesis of
the disease has been postulated. Examples of this class of vi-
ruses include Epstein-Barr virus (3, 4), cytomegalovirus (5,
6), human immunodeficiency virus (7), and probably the
putative viral agent associated with non–A-G posthepatitis
AA (8, 9). Furthermore, T cells seem to be important be-
cause there is a correlation between susceptibility to AA
and certain MHC haplotypes (10, 11) and hematopoietic
function improves after immunosuppressive strategies with
antilymphocyte sera or syngeneic BM transplantation (12,
13). It is not known, however, whether virus-induced T
cell–mediated AA depends on (a) a cognate interaction be-
tween T cells and hematopoietic cells presenting a virus-
derived T cell epitope on the appropriate MHC, (b) on sol-
uble mediators released from virus-specific T cells, or (c) on
loss of tolerance and autoimmune destruction of pluripo-
tent and committed stem cells (14).
We previously investigated innate immune effector
mechanisms involved in transient BM aplasia during acute
infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)
in mice devoid of the IFN-␣/␤R, IFN-␥R, functional NK
cells (perforin-deficient [P0/0] mice), Fas (CD95, lpr),
CD4ϩ, or CD8ϩ T cells (15). This study documented that
the reversible suppressive effect on hematopoietic precur-
sors in the BM was predominantly mediated by IFN-␣/␤
and that virally induced NK cells either by direct cytolysis
and/or secreted factors or LCMV-specific CTLs were not
involved at this early stage of infection. Although the non-
cytopathic LCMV replicated vigorously in megakaryocytes
and myeloid precursors in mice lacking IFN type I R
(IFN-␣/␤R0/0), the role of T cells could not be studied in
these mice because LCMV-specific CTLs are rapidly ex-
hausted by the overwhelming amounts of viral antigen
(16). The murine model infection with LCMV has con-
tributed substantially to the view, however, that T cell–
mediated protective immunity is involved in autoimmune
and/or immunopathological diseases via a direct cognate
cell to cell interaction in tissues that are either infected with
LCMV or express the relevant epitopes derived from
LCMV (17). Thus, the classical choriomeningitis (18), hep-
atitis (19), immunosuppression (20) and LCMV-triggered
destruction of the islets of Langerhans (21) or oligodendro-
cytes in the central nervous system expressing the glyco-
protein of LCMV (LCMV-GP; reference 22) have been
shown to be CD8ϩ T cell mediated and contact depen-
dent. It has been suggested that the permanent release of
cytokines secreted by virus-specific T cells during persistent
LCMV infection induces cachexia and supports inflamma-
tory processes causing chronic disease, and that both CD4ϩ
T helper cells and CD8ϩ CTLs are involved (23–25). The
BM may be particularly susceptible to T cell–mediated, cy-
tokine-dependent injury because blood cells, in contrast to
solid epithelial organs, must continuously regenerate and
their constant levels in the periphery are maintained by
asymmetric division from a small number of pluripotent
stem cells (26).
We therefore evaluated the respective potential role of
CD4ϩ and CD8ϩ T cells and of their released soluble me-
diators in causing hematopoietic abnormalities during per-
sistent LCMV infection in P0/0 mice. These mutant mice
were chosen as experimental model because they exhibit a
vigorous and continuous LCMV-specific T cell response
but are unable to clear the virus (27). Here we report that
LCMV-specific CD8ϩ T cells, but not CD4ϩ T cells,
caused AA in LCMV-infected P0/0 mice. By generating
double-knockout mice genetically deficient for perforin and
TNFR1 (P0/0/TNFR10/0) and by using a sheep antiserum
neutralizing mouse IFN-␥, LCMV-induced AA was pre-
vented and infected mice became life-long virus carriers
through functional exhaustion of virus-specific, IFN-␥–
secreting CD8ϩ T cells.
Materials and Methods
Mice. The generation and breeding of P0/0, LCMV-GP–spe-
cific TCR-transgenic (tg; line 318), P0/0 TCR-tg (P0/0 ϫ TCR),
and mice expressing the LCMV-GP transgene under the control
of the rat insulin promoter have been described previously (21,
27). These mice and C57BL/6 mice as controls were obtained
from the breeding colony at the Institut für Versuchstierkunde
(University of Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland). Mice lacking
TNFR1 (TNFR10/0 [28]) were bred at the animal facility of F.
Hoffmann–La Roche Ltd. (Basel, Switzerland). All mouse strains
were kept under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. Sex-
matched mice of 8–12 wk of age were used. The animal protec-
tion law of the Kanton of Zürich (Zürich, Switzerland) limits the
number of mice to be used in experiments, particularly if disease
is severe. Therefore, experiments generally were repeated twice
with groups of two to four mice.
Breeding of Mice with Double Deficiency for Perforin and TNFR1 (P0/0/
TNFR10/0). TNFR10/0 mice are homozygous mutant mice that
originally were bred by crossing germline transmitters of the mu-
tated TNFR1 allele (129/SvEv, H-2b) with C57BL/6 (H-2b)
mice. These single-knockout mice were crossed with P0/0 mice
(pure C57BL/6 background) and the resulting F1 generation with
heterozygosity for both alleles (TNFR1 and perforin) was inter-
bred to yield homozygous double-knockout F2 offsprings (P0/0/
TNFR10/0). The F2 generation displayed the expected mendelian
1:16 frequency of homozygous P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice, indicating
that these mice are fertile and breed normally; in addition, they
have no apparent phenotypic abnormalities and have a normal life
span. Homozygous P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice were identified by the
presence of both mutated alleles, determined with PCR using
two different primer pairs for each, perforin and TNFR1, respec-
tively, on DNA prepared from tail biopsies. The first pair (5Ј-
TTT TTG AGA CCC TGT AGA CCC A-3Ј, 5Ј-GCA TCG
CCT TCT ATC GCC TTC T-3Ј) detecting the perforin geno-
type yields a band of 665 bp for the mutated and is negative for
the wild-type (wt) allele, the second pair (5Ј-CCG GTC CTG
AAC TCC TGG CCA A-3Ј, 5Ј-CCC CTG CAC ACA TTA
CTG GAA G-3Ј) yields a 300-bp fragment for the wt and a
1905 Binder et al.
1,300-bp fragment for the mutated allele. The TNFR1 genotype
was determined with a first pair detecting the neo cassette (5Ј-
GTT AGG TCT CTC CTG AAT GTG ATC-3Ј, 5Ј-TCC
CGC TTC AGT GAC AAC GTC-3Ј), which results in a 2,000-bp
fragment for the mutated and is negative for the wt allele; the sec-
ond pair (5Ј-CTC TCT TGT GAT CAG CAC TG-3Ј, 5Ј-CTG
GAA GTG TGT CTC AC-3Ј) yields a 1,400-bp fragment for
the wt and a 2,000-bp fragment for the mutated allele.
Virus. LCMV-WE, originally obtained from Dr. F. Leh-
mann-Grube (Pette Institut, Hamburg, Germany; reference 29),
was used in all experiments and mice were always infected with
200 PFU intravenously. Second passage virus derived from
plaque-purified isolates was propagated on L929-fibroblast cells.
The virus was titrated using an immunological focus assay that is
two- to threefold less sensitive than virus titers detected by in
vivo infection (30). LCMV titers are expressed as log10 of PFU/
ml (blood), log10 of PFU/107 nucleated cells (BM), or as log10 of
PFU/g of tissue (solid organs). Recombinant vaccinia virus ex-
pressing LCMV-GP (vacc-LCMV-GP) was a gift from Dr.
D.H.L. Bishop (Institute of Virology, Oxford University, Ox-
ford, UK). Recombinant vaccinia virus stocks were grown on
BSC 40 cells. The cells and culture supernatants were collected 2 d
after infection, subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing,
sonicated on ice for 30 s, and centrifuged.
Peripheral Blood Values and BM Cytology. Blood samples (40
␮l diluted 1:5) were obtained from the retrobulbar plexus of
ether-anesthetized mice and cellular blood counts (CBCs) were
determined in a hemocytometer (TECHNICON H2®; Techni-
con Instruments Corp., Tarrytown, NY). Differential white
blood cell counts were defined microscopically by scoring blood
smears stained with May-Grünwald/Giemsa. Reticulocyte counts
were quantitated by flow cytometry (SYSMEX R-3000®; Toa
Medical Electronics, Kobe, Japan). Differential counts of BM cells
were determined on May-Grünwald/Giemsa, Sudan black B, my-
eloperoxidase, chloracetate esterase, or ␣-naphthyl butyrate es-
terase stained smears. For immunocytochemical detection of
LCMV, BM smears on slides were fixed in acetone and stained
with the rat anti-LCMV mAb VL-4 as described (15). CD11c on
dendritic cells was stained with the hamster mAb N418 (HB-224;
American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD). Primary
hamster Igs were detected by alkaline-phosphatase–labeled rabbit
anti–hamster Ig followed by alkaline-phosphatase–labeled goat
anti–rabbit Ig.
Pluripotent and Committed Progenitor Assays. Pluripotent and com-
mitted hematopoietic progenitors were determined as described
before (15). In brief, recipient mice were immunized with 102
PFU of LCMV. 2 wk later they were lethally irradiated (900 cGy)
and reconstituted intravenously with 104–105 syngeneic BM cells
from infected or uninfected control mice. 12 d after irradiation,
the spleens of the recipient mice were fixed in Tellesnicky’s fixa-
tive and individual colonies on the spleen surface (colony-form-
ing unit–stem cells [CFU-S]) were counted under a dissecting
microscope. Cell suspensions from BM in isotonic balanced salt
solution (BSS) were counted and assessed for viability by trypan
blue exclusion before testing in vitro for colony formation. The
culture mixture was prepared in IMDM supplemented with 5 ϫ
10-5 mol/liter 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin-streptomycin, 0.9%
methylcellulose, 30% FCS, and 1% BSA in the presence of opti-
mized concentrations of growth factors (murine [m]IL-3 [30 U/
ml] and mGM-CSF [30 U/ml] for CFU–granulocyte/macro-
phage [CFU-GM]; mIL-3 [30 U/ml] and human erythropoietin
[5 U/ml] for burst-forming unit–erythroid [BFU-E]; and mIL-3
[30 U/ml] and murine thrombopoietin [mTPO; 500 ng/ml] for
CFU–megakaryocyte [CFU-Meg]). Recombinant murine IL-3
and GM-CSF were obtained from PharMingen Inc. (San Diego,
CA), recombinant human erythropoietin was purchased from
Cilag AG (Schaffhausen, Switzerland), and recombinant mTPO
was a gift from Genentech Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Indi-
vidual colonies were scored by morphology after 5–7 d (CFU-
Meg), 7 d (CFU-GM), or 8 d (BFU-E). The total number of col-
onies per femur was calculated using the cellularity obtained for
the individual BM.
Antiserum Treatment of Mice. Monoclonal rat anti–mouse CD4
(YTS 191.1) and monoclonal rat anti–mouse CD8 (YTS 169.4)
were originally obtained from Dr. H. Waldmann (Dunn School
of Pathology, Oxford, UK; reference 31). Thymectomized mice
were injected intravenously with 2 mg of the appropriate mAb 3
and 1 d before LCMV infection. Efficacy of treatment was
checked by FACS® (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA)
analysis. The production of sheep anti–mouse IFN-␥ antiserum
has been described (32). After partial purification of pooled sera
by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, neutralizing titers of 5 ϫ 104 neu-
tralizing units (NU)/ml were obtained. Mice were treated daily
from day 5 to day 15 after LCMV infection with 2 ϫ 104 NU
anti–IFN-␥ in 0.2 ml of BSS intraperitoneally. Control mice
were injected with normal sheep serum.
Cytotoxicity Assay. CTL activity of spleen cells was deter-
mined by a 51Cr–release assay as described (33). In brief, mice
were infected intravenously 8 d before with 200 PFU of LCMV.
Single spleen cell suspensions were prepared at 7 ϫ 106/ml in
MEM ϩ 2% FCS. Fibroblast target cells MC57G (H-2b) or T cell
lymphoma target cells RMA (H-2b) were coated with LCMV-
GP–derived immunodominant peptide amino acids (aa)33-41
(glycoprotein [gp]33) at a concentration of 10-6 M, and were la-
beled with 1 ␮Ci of Na51CrO4 for 2 h at 37ЊC, washed three
times, and resuspended at 105/ml. Threefold dilutions of spleen
cells were incubated with 100 ␮l of target cells in 96-well micro-
titer round-bottomed plates for 5 h. A total of 70 ␮l of the super-
natant was assayed for released 51Cr. The percent specific release
of 51Cr was calculated as [(experimental release Ϫ spontaneous re-
lease) ϫ 100/(total release Ϫ spontaneous release)]. Spontaneous
release was always Ͻ20%.
Analysis of Secreted Cytokines by LCMV-specific T Cells. Mice were
immunized intravenously with 200 PFU LCMV-WE. 8 or 14 d
later, CD8ϩ T cells were purified from spleen cell suspensions by
MACS® sorting according to the protocol of the supplier (Mil-
tenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany); the proportion of
pure CD8ϩ T cells obtained was in the range of 70–85%. 105
CD8ϩ T cells were incubated in 96 wells with threefold serial di-
lutions of gp33 in concentrations ranging from 10-6 to 10-8 M or
medium only (RPMI, FCS 5%, with Con A supernatant 2%) in
the presence of 6 ϫ 105 irradiated (2,000 cGy) C57BL/6 spleen
cells. 48 h later supernatants were analyzed for IFN-␥ and TNF/
lymphotoxin (LT)-␣ by ELISA as described (34).
Flow Cytometry. Single-cell suspensions of BM, thymus, or
spleen were prepared at 4ЊC in buffer solution (BSS containing
2% FCS and 0.2% NaN3) for staining with mAbs conjugated with
fluorochromes. The following antibodies were used: anti-CD4
and anti-CD8 (Becton Dickinson), anti-TCR V␣2, anti–IFN-␥,
and anti-TNF/LT-␣ (PharMingen). To detect expansion of
gp33-specific TCR-tg T cells in the BM, cell suspensions were
doubly stained with a PE-conjugated V␣2-specific mAb and
FITC-conjugated anti-CD8–specific mAb. After lysis of erythro-
cytes with FACS® lysis solution and washing, cell suspensions
were analyzed on a FACScan® using logarithmic scales. To detect
intracellular cytokines, MACS®-enriched CD8ϩ T cells were
1906 Aplastic Anemia in Persistent LCMV Infection
stimulated with PMA (0.05 ␮g/ml) and ionomycin (0.5 ␮g/ml)
for 4 h. Subsequently, the cells were incubated for a further 2 h in
the presence of 2 ␮M monensin. After washing and surface label-
ing with PE-conjugated anti-CD8, cells were fixed in PBS con-
taining 2% paraformaldehyde. Thereafter, cells were permeabi-
lized with saponine (0.1%) and unspecific binding to cytoplasmic
proteins was blocked with 1:16 diluted normal rat serum. Intra-
cellular cytokines were then stained with FITC-conjugated anti–
IFN-␥ or FITC-conjugated anti-TNF/LT-␣ and saponine was
removed by washing with buffer solution. Multiparameter analy-
sis was performed with a FACScan® using logarithmic scales. Via-
ble cells were gated by forward and side scatter of light.
Statistics. Data are presented as means Ϯ SD unless stated
otherwise. Comparisons were made using the two-tailed un-
paired Student’s t test, the analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the
Scheffe’s post hoc procedure as appropriate. A P value of Ͻ0.05
was regarded as significant.
Results
Lethal Pancytopenia Caused by Virus-specific CD8ϩ T Cells
in Chronic LCMV Infection of P0/0 Mice. The initial CBCs
of uninfected P0/0 and wt C57BL/6 mice kept under SPF
conditions were comparable (Fig. 1). After infection with
LCMV, wt C57BL/6 mice showed a moderate, but revers-
ible depression of the CBCs. Neutrophils were lowest on
day 3 and reticulocytes on days 9–12 after infection. The
transient reduction of platelets and RBCs in C57BL/6
mice was very mild and mainly due to repetitive blood
sampling (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, LCMV-infected P0/0 mice
exhibited an abrupt and continuous stop of reticulocyte
production starting from day 5 post infection (p.i.), the
RBC and the thrombocyte count progressively dropped
within 14 d, and the neutrophil count remained below
1,000/␮l after day 3. Death ensued between day 14 and 24
p.i. To assess the respective role of CD8ϩ and/or CD4ϩ T
cells, thymectomized P0/0 mice were treated with either a
rat mAb specific for CD4 (YTS 191.1) or a rat anti–mouse
CD8 (YTS 169.4) on days Ϫ3 and Ϫ1 before infection
with LCMV (Fig. 1 B). CD8-depleted P0/0 mice showed
an identical time course of the altered CBCs as compared
with CD8-depleted wt C57BL/6 mice (not shown). Com-
pared with untreated LCMV-infected C57BL/6 mice,
reticulocytes recovered 4 d earlier and numerically to a
lesser extent in CD8-depleted P0/0 mice (Fig. 1, A and B).
The kinetics of the transient decrease of the thrombocytes
and the neutrophils was comparable between CD8-depleted
P0/0 and untreated C57BL/6 mice, except for a slightly
higher neutrophil count after day 10. This difference was
probably due to the increased viral load in the CD8-
depleted P0/0 mice that become LCMV carriers, whereas
untreated C57BL/6 mice have cleared LCMV on day 10
(not shown). In contrast, anti-CD4–treated P0/0 mice had
succumbed similarly to untreated P0/0 mice between 14 and
24 d after LCMV infection, due to the severely depressed
CBCs (Fig. 1 B). In addition to early induced IFN-␣/␤
(15), these results implicate that LCMV-specific CD8ϩ

T cells contribute to transient BM suppression also in wt
C57BL/6 mice during the later phase of LCMV-infection.
The predominant role of LCMV-specific CD8ϩ T cells
causing pancytopenia in P0/0 mice was further analyzed by
infecting P0/0 mice expressing a tg TCR specific for the
glycoprotein peptide aa33-41 derived from LCMV-GP
(P0/0 ϫ TCR). In naive P0/0 ϫ TCR mice, the proportion
of CD8ϩ spleen cells expressing the tg TCR is ‫,%05ف‬ and
88% of T cells in the blood periphery are positive for the tg
TCR 9 d after LCMV infection (21). As shown in Fig. 1 B,
in the presence of an increased frequency of LCMV-spe-
cific CD8ϩ T cells in P0/0 ϫ TCR mice, the CBCs dimin-
ished very rapidly, and within 6–10 d irreversible pancy-
topenia caused death of infected mice. These TCR-tg mice
(V␣2/V␤8.1) allowed us to follow directly the kinetics of
LCMV-specific lymphocytes infiltrating and damaging the
BM in response to viral replication.
BM Analysis of P0/0 Mice after Infection with LCMV in the
Presence or Absence of CD4ϩ and CD8ϩ T Cells. To address
the question of whether pancytopenia in LCMV-infected
P0/0 mice reflected consumption or destruction of blood
cells rather than suppression of BM function, the different
BM compartments (i.e., pluripotent, lineage-committed,
and morphologically defined) were studied at several time
points after infection. Femoral cellularity in P0/0 mice had
dropped to 29 Ϯ 12% of baseline on day 14 and in P0/0 ϫ
TCR mice to 42 Ϯ 10% on day 8, whereas in C57BL/6
mice minimal values of 86 Ϯ 15% were observed 6–8 d af-
ter LCMV infection. Serial cytological analysis of BM
preparations revealed a complete loss of megakaryocytes
and a gradual deficiency of erythroblasts and postmytotic
myeloid cells until day 8 in P0/0 ϫ TCR and day 14 in P0/0
mice, respectively (Table 1). A gradual relative increase of
marrow monocytes and lymphocytes was noted in P0/0
and, more vigorously, in P0/0 ϫ TCR mice after LCMV
infection. Correlating with the morphologically defined
compartment, P0/0 mice exhibited a progressive decrease of
the number of pluripotent CFU-S (Fig. 2 A) and commit-
ted progenitors (Fig. 2 B), which reached minimal values
shortly before death on day 14. In LCMV-infected wt
C57BL/6 mice, a transient reduction of stem cells was also
observed, but it was less severe and was close to normal on
day 14 after LCMV infection. CD4-depleted P0/0 mice
showed loss of committed and pluripotent stem cells com-
parable to untreated P0/0 mice, whereas CD8-depleted P0/0
mice had Ͼ10-fold higher numbers of blood cell progenitors
after 14 d of LCMV-infection (Fig. 2). Thus, CD8ϩ, but not
CD4ϩ, T cells altered peripheral blood values of LCMV-
infected P0/0 mice by drastically reducing the frequency of
the pluripotent and the lineage-committed stem cells.
Role of Immunopathology versus Autoreactivity in AA of
LCMV-infected P0/0 Mice. Infiltration of virus-specific T
cells into the BM, replication kinetics of LCMV, and type
of BM cells infected with LCMV were assessed in P0/0 and
P0/0 ϫ TCR mice at various time points after infection.
Both strains of P0/0 (TCR tg and TCR non-tg) showed a
similar kinetics of LCMV replication in the BM and a
comparable plateau of persisting viral load in the range of

(Fig. 3 A). In contrast, viral titers in wt C57BL/6 mice did
not exceed 102 PFU/107 nucleated BM cells and were be-
low detection levels already on day 8 p.i. Concomitant ex-
pansion of polyclonal CD8ϩ T cells and T cells expressing
the TCR for gp33 presented on H-2b were followed flow
cytometrically by staining BM cells with a CD8– and a
TCR-V␣2–specific mAb (Fig. 3 B). By day 2 after LCMV
infection, the frequency of CD8ϩ T cells expressing the
V␣2 segment of the TCR was ‫%2ف‬ of all nucleated BM
cells and reached maximal levels 6 d p.i. in P0/0 ϫ TCR
mice. In P0/0 mice, BM infiltration with polyclonal CD8ϩ
T cells was less vigorous, but their proportion persisted
above 20% of BM cells until 14 d after LCMV infection.
Morphologically defined hematopoietic cells (according to
Table 1) infected with LCMV were detected by staining
BM smears with an LCMV-specific mAb (15) and N418,
an antibody detecting CD11c on dendritic cells (Fig. 3 C).
Although LCMV Ag was expressed in great amounts in
CD11c-positive APCs and stromal BM cells, LCMV did
not replicate to a detectable extent in hematopoietic cells in
C57BL/6, P0/0, and P0/0 ϫ TCR mice at any time point of
infection. Additionally, staining with the same mAb of picked
colonies of BFU-E, CFU-GM, and CFU-Meg of infected
P0/0 mice did not reveal replication of LCMV in early he-
matopoietic progenitors (data not shown).
To study whether blood cell precursors in the BM
shared antigenic determinants with LCMV and cross-reac-
tivity to self-Ags was involved in AA of LCMV-infected
P0/0 and P0/0 ϫ TCR mice, an experimental approach was
chosen that has been described previously (21). TCR-tg T
cells were activated by infecting P0/0 ϫ TCR mice intrave-
nously with 2 ϫ 106 PFU of vacc-LCMV-GP. After 6 d, 5 ϫ
106 spleen cells were adoptively transferred into sex-

matched, syngeneic tg mice expressing LCMV-GP in their
pancreas. Applying this protocol, gp33-specific tg T cells
were strongly activated, but vaccinia virus was efficiently
eliminated before the transfer of T cells because in the ab-
sence of perforin, the ability to control vaccinia virus is re-
tained (35). This allowed us to circumvent cotransfer of vi-
rus leading subsequently to uncontrolled viral replication in
recipient mice, as seen in LCMV-infected P0/0 and P0/0 ϫ
TCR mice. To keep the transferred cells in an activated
state, the recipients were infected intravenously with 2 ϫ
106 PFU vacc-LCMV-GP. All recipients receiving P0/0 ϫ
TCR spleen cells developed insulitis, i.e., extensive infiltra-
tion of CD8ϩ T cells into the pancreatic islets expressing
the LCMV-GP transgene was found histologically (21). In
contrast, no abnormalities of the CBCs were detected 10 d
and later after adoptive transfer of the tg T cells into the
same recipient mice (Table 2). Using the same experimen-
tal setup, a normal CBC was also obtained after transfer of
activated TCR-tg T cells into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice
that do not express the LCMV-GP transgene in their pan-
creas. Collectively, these findings made a direct, cognate
cell to cell interaction between virus-specific CD8ϩ T cells
and hematopoietic progenitors expressing either LCMV
peptides or cross-reactive self-epitopes on H-2b, subse-

Effects of LCMV Infection on Survival, Viral Replication, and
T Cell Response in P0/0 Mice that Lack TNFR1 Expression.
To test a possible T cell–dependent damaging effect of
TNF/LT-␣ in AA of LCMV-infected P0/0 mice, P0/0 mice
were crossed into TNFR10/0 mice. These mutants exhibit
normal CTL induction and effector functions against
LCMV (28). Lymphocyte subpopulations in the thymus
and the spleen in these double knockouts (P0/0/TNFR10/0)
were comparable to wt C57BL/6 mice, i.e., the concurrent
deficiency of perforin and TNFR1 in individual mice did
not alter the proportion of the two T cell compartments in
these lymphoid organs (Fig. 4 A, top). Activation and ex-
pansion of T cells in the spleen were followed by FACS®
analysis 8 d after infection with LCMV (Fig. 4 A, bottom).
Both P0/0 and P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice showed a similar in-
crease in CD8ϩ T cells by a factor of ‫5ف‬ and the typical in-
version of the CD4ϩ/CD8ϩ ratio from 1.5 of uninfected to
0.15 of infected individuals on day 8 after infection. In par-
allel, expanding CD8ϩ T cells in the spleen were similarly
activated in both mutant mouse strains, as demonstrated by
the increased forward light scatter of CD8ϩ T cells. (Note
the significantly higher proportion of large blasts in P0/0 and
P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice when compared with C57BL/6 mice
[Fig. 4 A, bottom].) The cytolytic effector function of
LCMV-induced CTLs was then assessed in an in vitro
51Cr–release assay 8 d after infection with LCMV (Fig. 4 B).
Spleen cells from P0/0 and P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice did not
lyse peptide-labeled MC57G fibrosarcoma (H-2b) targets
(not shown), whereas residual virus-specific, Fas/CD95-
mediated cytolytic activity was comparably detected on
gp33-labeled RMA lymphoma cells (H-2b) in both mouse
strains. By comparison, both parental strains (C57BL/6 and
TNFR10/0) exhibited an equal cytolytic activity on gp33-
labeled fibroblast (not shown) and lymphoma targets (Fig. 4
B). Infection with LCMV was lethal in age- and sex-
matched P0/0 mice by day 21 after infection (Fig. 4 C, left).
In contrast, P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice survived LCMV infec-
tion and demonstrated a loss of initial body weight and
subsequent runting disease comparable to thymectomized,
CD8-depleted P0/0 mice (Fig. 4 C, right). The kinetics of
viral replication was next examined in various solid organs
and hematopoietic tissues after different time points of
LCMV infection (Table 3). The increase in viral load was
comparable between P0/0/TNFR10/0 and P0/0 mice, and
maximal viral titers had reached similar values in all organs
tested already by day 8, reflecting an unaltered susceptibil-
ity to LCMV replication in P0/0 mice deficient in TNFR1
as opposed to P0/0 control mice. In contrast, wt C57BL/6
and TNFR10/0 mice had cleared LCMV by day 14 after in-
fection below detection levels. Surviving P0/0/TNFR10/0
mice remained persistently infected with LCMV and ex-
hibited a mild decrease in viral titers in most organs on day
90 after infection. These findings indicate that the deficient
signaling via TNFR1 provides LCMV-infected P0/0 mice
with a selective advantage over parental P0/0 mice; addi-
tional lack of TNF function prevents death and leads to a
life-long viral persistence, despite quantitatively and quali-
tatively comparable T cell responses and viral replication
kinetics after infection with LCMV.
CBCs and Functional BM Compartments after LCMV Infec-
tion of Mice Devoid of Perforin and TNFR1. Because P0/0/
TNFR10/0 mice survived LCMV infection, we anticipated
their CBCs to differ significantly from that of P0/0 mice
during LCMV infection. Surprisingly, both mutants exhib-
ited a similar decline of the RBC and platelet count during
the first 14 d and both abruptly ceased to produce reticulo-
cytes on day 5 after infection with LCMV (Fig. 5 A). Be-
tween days 14 and 30 after LCMV infection, however, P0/0/
1912 Aplastic Anemia in Persistent LCMV Infection
TNFR10/0 mice showed a vigorous regeneration of these
blood cells, whereas P0/0 mice failed to increase their
CBCs. The most apparent difference between LCMV-
infected P0/0 and P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice was observed in the
number of peripheral PMNs, which did not drop below a
value of ‫␮/000,1ف‬l in P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice, whereas in
P0/0 mice, generally Ͻ500/␮l neutrophils were counted af-
ter day 8 of LCMV infection. As expected from earlier data
(28), the CBCs of LCMV-infected, parental TNFR10/0
mice (Fig. 5 A) showed no significant difference when
compared with LCMV-infected C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 1 A).
To address the question of whether the transient depres-
sion of the CBCs was also mediated by CD8ϩ T cells,
thymectomized, CD4- and CD8-depleted individuals were
included in the experiments designed to determine the
number of progenitors in the BM of LCMV-infected P0/0/
TNFR10/0 mice. On day 8 after LCMV infection, the
number of pluripotent and committed stem cells did not
differ significantly between P0/0/TNFR10/0 and parental
P0/0 mice (not shown). In contrast, on day 14 p.i., when
the beginning of the reticulocyte crisis and point of return
of the CBC was noted, hematopoietic progenitors were
4–10-fold increased in P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice when com-
pared with P0/0 mice at the same time point (Fig. 5 B).
Thus, besides TNF/LT-␣, an additional CD8ϩ T cell–
mediated activity was apparently involved in LCMV-induced
AA because the numbers of stem cells in CD8- (but not
CD4-) depleted P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice increased after
LCMV infection and were then comparable to uninfected
P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice (Fig. 5 B).
IFN-␥ Production by LCMV-specific CD8ϩ T Cells in P0/0
and P0/0/TNFR10/0 Mice. In addition to TNF/LT-␣, T
cell–dependent IFN-␥ is known to inhibit hematopoietic
colony formation in vitro (36). We therefore evaluated
whether CD8ϩ T cells in LCMV-infected mutants pro-
duced IFN-␥, causing residual blood disease in P0/0/

TNFR10/0 mice. Serum samples of LCMV-infected P0/0
and P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice were serially analyzed for the
presence of IFN-␥ and TNF with a cytokine-specific
ELISA, detecting TNF and LT-␣. From days 4 to 10 after
LCMV infection, increasing amounts of these cytokines
were measured in the serum with maximal values of 100
U/ml of IFN-␥ and 60 ng/ml of TNF/LT-␣ on day 10.
The serum concentrations of the cytokines did not differ
significantly between P0/0 and P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice, but
both cytokines were below detection limit in LCMV-
infected C57BL/6 control mice during the entire study
period (not shown). To identify cytokine-producing lym-
phocytes in vivo, the proportion of MACS®-enriched
CD8ϩ spleen cells, expressing cytokines in the cytoplasma,
were measured by FACS® analysis (Fig. 6 A). Before
LCMV infection, background levels of IFN-␥–positive
CD8ϩ T cells were comparable in all mouse strains but 8 d
later, a similar increase of IFN-␥–expressing CD8ϩ T cells
was detected in P0/0 and P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice, whereas the
frequency of these cells was lower in infected C57BL/6
mice. Intracellular production of IFN-␥ by bulk CD8ϩ T
cells in vivo was LCMV-GP specific, i.e., on day 8 after in-
fection, CD8ϩ spleen cells of LCMV-infected mutant and
wt mice secreted similar amounts of soluble IFN-␥ when
restimulated in vitro with irradiated APCs pulsed with
gp33 in the presence or absence of IL-2 (Fig. 6 B). How-
ever, in contrast to C57BL/6 mice, gp33-specific, IFN-␥
secreting CD8ϩ T cells had disappeared in P0/0 and P0/0/
TNFR10/0 mice on day 14 after LCMV infection. Neither
cytoplasmic mAb staining for TNF/LT-␣ nor restimula-
tion in vitro with gp33 or LCMV revealed production of
TNF/LT-␣ by CD8ϩ T cells above the detection limit, in-
dicating that the source of TNF/LT-␣ was not LCMV-
specific CD8ϩ T cells. Thus, induction of cytokine-secret-
ing, CD8ϩ T cell responses by LCMV was unimpaired in
P0/0 and P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice when compared with wt
C57BL/6 mice, but due to the overwhelming replication
of LCMV in lympho-hematopoietic and solid tissue in
these mutants, LCMV-specific CD8ϩ T cells secreting
IFN-␥ were eventually exhausted, irrespective of the pres-
ence or absence of TNFR1 signaling.
Dominant Role of IFN-␥ over TNF/LT-␣ in Causing
LCMV-induced AA. To further dissect the effect of indi-
vidual cytokines involved in virus-induced AA, LCMV-
infected mutants, lacking function of IFN-␥, were studied.
Because the perforin and the IFN-␥R gene are both lo-
cated on the same chromosome, interrupting the IFN-␥–sig-
naling pathway was not readily feasible (i.e., by crossing
IFN-␥R0/0 mice into P0/0 mice), and therefore an IFN-␥–
neutralizing sheep anti–mouse IFN-␥ antiserum (32) was
used. P0/0 mice were treated daily from days 5 to 15 after
infection with LCMV with 2 ϫ 104 NU anti–IFN-␥ intra-
peritoneally and control mice were injected with the same
volume of normal sheep serum (NSS). P0/0 mice treated
with anti–IFN-␥ survived LCMV infection and became virus
carriers similar to NSS– and anti–IFN-␥–treated P0/0/
TNFR10/0 mice (not shown), whereas NSS-treated P0/0
mice died within the usual time period.
The CBCs improved drastically in anti–IFN-␥–treated
P0/0 mice during the critical time period, starting on day 10
after LCMV infection, when compared with NSS-treated
controls (Fig. 7, A and B, left). In LCMV-infected P0/0/
TNFR10/0 mice, the effect of daily anti–IFN-␥ treatment
was more moderate, i.e., the increase of the neutrophil
count was only about fourfold when compared with NSS-

uninfected control mice of the same genotype were included in the same
experimental settings (open symbols). MACS®-enriched CD8ϩ spleen cells
of infected wt and mutant mice were restimulated in vitro with irradiated
syngeneic APCs coated in threefold serial dilutions with gp33 in the pres-
ence of IL-2. After 48 h, IFN-␥ was measured in an ELISA; numbers on
ordinates represent IFN-␥ concentrations in supernatant (U/ml).
1914 Aplastic Anemia in Persistent LCMV Infection
treated P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice (Fig. 7 A, right). Because the
number of RBCs in anti–IFN-␥–treated P0/0/TNFR10/0
mice decreased only to a mild extent, the regeneration of
RBCs on day 14 after LCMV infection was weaker than
that of NSS-treated P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice. This is reflected
by a less vigorous production of reticulocytes when anti–
IFN-␥ treatment was given daily to LCMV-infected P0/0/
TNFR10/0 mice (Fig. 7 B, right). Moreover, the number of
eosinophils of both P0/0 and P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice had re-
turned to normal levels 14 d after LCMV infection when
the mutants were treated with anti–IFN-␥, but not when
treated with NSS (Fig. 7 A, bottom). After neutralizing
IFN-␥ in LCMV-infected P0/0 mice with daily anti–IFN-␥
treatment, CFU-GM and BFU-E were 1.5–2-fold higher
than in NSS-treated P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice 14 d after infec-
tion (Fig. 7, C and D). When both cytokines were blocked
during LCMV infection (anti–IFN-␥–treated P0/0/TNFR10/0
mice), committed stem cell frequencies were comparable
to CD8ϩ-depleted P0/0 and normal C57BL/6 mice on day
14 after LCMV infection. These findings collectively indi-
cate that the myelosuppressive effect of IFN-␥ in chroni-
cally infected P0/0 mice was much more efficient when
compared in the absence of TNF/LT-␣ function, as ana-
lyzed in LCMV-infected P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice.
Discussion
Mechanism of Development and Rescue from
Aplastic Anemia
LCMV-infected P0/0 mice represent a model for virus-asso-
ciated AA as they develop a disorder that shares most of the
hematologic and immunologic properties of human AA as-
sociated with seronegative hepatitis for A-G or other viral
infections that are not cytopathic for hematopoietic cells. It
manifests as a progressive pancytopenia with uniform de-
pression of the CBC that is lethal for 100% of infected
mice. Morphologically, the blood smear shows no abnor-
malities and analysis of the precursors in the BM reveals
drastically reduced numbers of hematopoietic progenitors,
including those for erythroid cells (BFU-E), myeloid cells
(CFU-GM), megakaryocytes (CFU-Meg), and stem cells
(CFU-S 12). Depletion experiments with mAb demon-
strate the critical role of CD8ϩ T cells but not of CD4ϩ T
cells or NK cells, a finding corresponding closely to the im-
mune phenotype found in the BM and blood of patients
with AA (37). Acceleration of disease in TCR-tg animals is
reminiscent of the association between certain MHC class I
alleles and the incidence of AA in some patient popula-
tions, which may reflect differences in the TCR repertoire

or precursor frequency being involved in progression to se-
vere disease (10). TNF/LT-␣ and IFN-␥ are the most im-
portant inhibitory molecules of hematopoiesis in AA of
LCMV-infected P0/0 mice, and are also detected in marrow
cell preparations from most cases with AA in humans (38–40).
CTL-mediated Immunopathology. AA in LCMV-infected
P0/0 mice is the consequence of a nonbalanced antiviral im-
mune response caused by a conflict between persisting viral
Ag and continuously expanding CD8ϩ T cells in the BM.
In the presence of a comparable viral load and similar repli-
cation kinetics of LCMV in P0/0 and TCR-tg P0/0 mice,
vigorously expanding TCR-tg T cells do not eliminate
LCMV from the BM but cause AA very rapidly after infec-
tion. This accelerated development of AA illustrates the
causal role of the major LCMV-GP–specific effector T cell
population in H-2b mice. Consistent with the general ob-
servation that CD4ϩ T cells are not necessary for the in-
duction of antiviral CD8ϩ T effector cells against LCMV
(41), CD8ϩ T cell–depleted P0/0 mice do not develop AA
after LCMV infection. A “compensatory” immunopatho-
logic role for CD4ϩ T cells in mice lacking CD8ϩ CTLs, as
has been suggested in meningitis provoked by intracerebral
infection of ␤2-microglobulin–deficient mice with LCMV
(25), is not observed in AA of LCMV-infected P0/0 mice.
Cognate Interaction between TCR and Stem Cells versus By-
stander Effect. There is no evidence that a precise cell–cell
contact between virus-specific CD8ϩ T cells and hemato-
poietic progenitors presenting a viral epitope on H-2b is es-
sential for development of AA in LCMV-infected P0/0
mice. LCMV persists in high amounts in the BM and colo-
calizes with stromal and CD11c-positive APCs in BM
smears, but virus is not detected in the morphologically de-
fined hematopoietic cells of aplastic P0/0 mice. This obser-
vation is similar to a previous report, demonstrating LCMV
replication in splenic dendritic cells after infection of mice
with LCMV clone 13, subsequently leading to generalized
immune suppression through elimination of these APCs by
virus-specific CTLs (42). Because P0/0 mice lack cytotoxic
effector functions and therefore cannot kill mesenchymal
cells, LCMV-infected APCs in the BM of P0/0 mice are not
destroyed but support continuous expansion of virus-spe-
cific CD8ϩ T cells by serving as an Ag reservoir. Damage
by virus-specific T cells and a subsequent early dropout of
LCMV-infected stem cells is unlikely to be involved in the
pathogenesis of LCMV-induced AA in P0/0 mice because
lineage-committed progenitors, cultured in vitro at differ-
ent time points after infection, are free of virus. Loss of tol-
erance and autoimmunity to progenitors in the BM may be
an important mechanism of virus-associated AA in humans
(14) and T cell clones, showing autoreactivity to autolo-
gous blood cell precursors expressing MHC-DP determi-
nants, have been established (43). As demonstrated in the
adoptive transfer experiments, AA in LCMV-infected P0/0
mice is not caused by autoimmunity to hematopoietic stem
cells in the BM. Taken together, these results implicate that
a cognate cell to cell interaction between the TCR of virus-
specific CD8ϩ T cells and hematopoietic stem cells either
expressing a LCMV-derived epitope or a cross-reactive
self-Ag presented on MHC I, leading to contact-dependent
destruction of stem cells, is not involved in AA of LCMV-
infected P0/0 mice.
Role of TNF/LT-␣ and IFN-␥. Generation of P0/0 mice
devoid of the 55-kD TNFR1 gene (P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice)
has contributed substantially to the understanding of the
mechanism of induction and recovery of AA. In the adult
mouse, lack of TNFR1 is not important for clonal deletion
of T cells reactive to endogenous viral superantigens and
thus, selection of the TCR repertoire is not altered (44).
P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice exhibit normal organ sizes of lym-
phatic tissues, and lymphocyte populations in the thymus
and spleen of naive mice are comparable to parental P0/0
and TNFR10/0 mice. This suggests normal positive/nega-
tive selection of T cells in the absence of both perforin and
TNF/LT-␣. More important, LCMV titers, expansion of
CD8ϩ T cells, Ag specificity, and effector functions via the
Fas (CD95)/Fas ligand pathway of virus-specific CD8ϩ T
cells are identical in P0/0 and P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice. Yet
LCMV-infected P0/0 mice die of irreversible AA, whereas
P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice survive and become virus carriers.
They still exhibit BM suppression, although it is quantita-
tively less severe and reversible after day 14 of LCMV in-
fection. There are two alternative possibilities explaining
why TNF/LT-␣ in LCMV-associated AA is a key mole-
cule deciding on irreversibility of BM failure. (a) TNFR1 is
the biologically relevant TNF receptor binding both solu-
ble ligands, TNF and LT-␣, by signaling cytotoxicity/apop-
tosis to many cells, including hematopoietic precursors (28,
45). Injection of TNF into rodents may produce a stimula-
tory effect on hematopoiesis by induction of colony-stimu-
lating activities in the endothelium (46). In contrast, inhib-
itory effects of TNF/LT-␣ on hematopoietic colony
formation is well documented in vitro (36). The results in
LCMV-infected P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice rather support the
interpretation that the ultimate effect of TNF/LT-␣ activ-
ity in virus-associated AA in vivo is suppressive via induc-
tion of apoptosis of BM progenitors and is not stimulatory.
(b) Alternatively, TNF/LT-␣ may enhance lymphocyte
traffic into the BM by increasing local MHC expression in
LCMV-infected dendritic and stromal BM cells. Such a
pathway of enhanced CTL-mediated immunopathology
has been described in double-tg mice expressing LCMV-
GP and TNF in the pancreatic islets (47). The sum of our
data supports the first scenario because CD4ϩ/CD8ϩ T cell
compartments after LCMV infection in the spleen (which
is a blood cell–forming tissue in mice) are not altered in the
absence of TNFR1. Moreover, the primary foot pad swell-
ing reaction after local infection with LCMV in TNFR10/0
mice is normal, indicating a normal recruitment of virus-
specific CTLs into infected tissue (28).We have not assessed
the cellular source of the increased TNF/LT-␣ concentra-
tion in the serum of LCMV-infected P0/0 mice. However,
we have not found TNF/LT-␣ secretion by LCMV-GP–
specific CD8ϩ T cells in vitro. It is conceivable that TNF/
LT-␣ is produced by the monocyte/macrophage system
1916 Aplastic Anemia in Persistent LCMV Infection
also in LCMV-infected P0/0 mice, as has been found for
hepatic macrophages in LCMV-infected hepatitis B virus–
transgenic mice (48), or it may be secreted by the stromal
matrix of the BM (49).
Depletion experiments with antibodies demonstrate the
critical role for IFN-␥–secreting LCMV-GP–specific
CD8ϩ T cells, causing AA in LCMV-infected P0/0 mice.
The following points need to be considered for correct in-
terpretation. (a) IFN-␥ exerts a potent inhibitory effect on
hematopoietic colony formation in semisolid culture assays
in vitro (39, 50) and in long-term cultures, killing via apop-
tosis and inhibition of cell cycling of stem cells has been
found (51). In LCMV-infected P0/0 mice, stromal cells in
the BM express high amounts of LCMV Ag. However, in
contrast to LCMV-infected normal C57BL/6 mice (42),
these cells are not eliminated and, therefore, feeder func-
tions of BM stroma are unlikely to be altered, as demon-
strated by the virtually normal hematopoiesis in infected
P0/0 mice lacking both IFN-␥ and TNF/LT-␣ signaling.
Furthermore, constitutive expression of IFN-␥ in the stro-
mal microenvironment of marrow cultures suppresses pro-
genitor growth in vitro, but seems not to interfere with the
expression of hematopoietic growth factor genes such as
G-CSF and GM-GSF (51). These observations argue against a
stromal defect as cause of AA in LCMV-infected P0/0 mice
and favor a direct toxic effect of the cytokines for progenitors
leading to AA. (b) The results obtained from IFN-␥–depleted
P0/0 and P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice demonstrate that IFN-␥ is
more potent in suppressing hematopoiesis than TNF/LT-␣.
This may be in contrast to the synergistic inhibitory effect
of IFN-␥ and TNF/LT-␣ that has been documented on
colony formation in vitro (36). The dissimilarity to these in
vitro findings is best explained by the sustained expansion
of IFN-␥–secreting CD8ϩ T cells in the presence of per-
sisting LCMV in aplastic P0/0 mice and rather reflects the
kinetics of the immune response than the toxic potential of
TNF/LT-␣ versus that of IFN-␥. It will be interesting to
study whether TNF/LT-␣ production in macrophages is
diminished in the absence of IFN-␥ in LCMV-infected P0/0
mice, because IFN-␥ is known to induce expression of
TNF/LT-␣ in these cells (52). (c) IFN-␥ exerts important
effects on MHC I/II expression and thereby influences Ag
presentation (53). Recent data has shown that IFN-␥
knockout mice generate LCMV-specific primary CTLs
with equivalent activities and terminate acute LCMV in-
fection as efficiently as normal control mice (16, 54). This
finding and the typical inversion of CD4ϩ/CD8ϩ T cells in
spleens of IFN-␥–depleted, LCMV-infected P0/0 mice, ex-
cludes an insufficient induction of virus-specific CD8ϩ T
cells being involved in improvement of hematopoietic
function in the absence of IFN-␥. (d) In LCMV-infected
P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice, residual BM suppression is reversible
and BM function is rescued after IFN-␥–secreting CD8ϩ T
cells have disappeared. Because CD8ϩ T cells of P0/0/
TNFR10/0 mice lack functional TNF/LT-␣ signaling, this
finding argues against a distinct role for TNF/LT-␣ in tol-
erance induction by functional exhaustion of LCMV-spe-
cific CTLs leading to viral persistence. This is in contrast
to a recent report, demonstrating a delayed deletion of
LCMV-specific TCR-tg CTLs in an adoptive transfer sys-
tem (55). In the latter study, an LCMV-GP–derived pep-
tide was administered and, therefore, the critical threshold
of Ag concentration and distribution, as well as sustained
presentation of the Ag on MHC I, required for exhaustive
activation of virus-specific CTLs, has probably not been
achieved. Thus, the close correlation of kinetics between
BM recovery and functional exhaustion of LCMV-specific
CD8ϩ T cells emphasizes the causal role of CD8ϩ T cell–
dependent IFN-␥ in LCMV-induced AA. (e) Even over-
whelming IFN-␥ secretion is not sufficient to reduce viral
titers in the BM of LCMV-infected P0/0 mice. This is in
contrast to HBV-specific CTLs, which have been shown to
abolish HBV replication in the liver of tg mice via secre-
tion of TNF/LT-␣ and IFN-␥. Damage of the hepatocyte
did not follow Ag recognition and CTL-dependent cyto-
kine secretion (56). This apparent discrepancy to LCMV-
associated AA may reflect the difference of the cell cycling
conditions in hematopoietic tissue, i.e., regularly dividing
pluripotent and committed stem cells are likely to be more
susceptible to locally secreted cytokines than hepatocytes.
Relevance to Virus-associated Aplastic Anemia in Humans
Virus-associated AA in humans and in LCMV-infected P0/0
mice differ in several details that need to be explained.
Clinically, pancytopenia in human AA presents gradually,
usually 1–7 wk after an episode of acute hepatitis (8). In
contrast, LCMV-infected P0/0 mice exhibit very rapid ki-
netics of blood cell depression and BM failure. The influ-
ence of a relatively high LCMV dose applied intravenously
to inbred mice fostered in an SPF environment may par-
tially account for the aggressive disease development. More
important, P0/0 mice are an exceptional example of a virus
host relationship because P0/0 mice cannot control LCMV
replication, and therefore high viral titers are reached very
early after infection. Additionally, the rapid progression to
lethal AA may be due to an intrinsic difference in the ki-
netics and turnover of hematopoietic cells in mice versus
humans (e.g., a higher proportion of mouse stem cells are
in the cell cycle). Particularly, the low granulocyte count in
mice of the C57BL/6 background and the shorter life span
of erythrocytes and platelets may contribute to the rapid
time course of the disease. It is noteworthy, that assessment
of CFU-S on day 12 does not reflect the frequency of the
repopulating cell in mice, i.e., the pluripotent stem cell.
However, depletion of these most primitive stem cells in
aplastic P0/0 mice may be inferred from the results obtained
from the CBCs, the culture data, and the content of CFU-S
in the BM. Furthermore, loss of CFU-S in LCMV-infected
P0/0 mice appears to sufficiently reflect the human pheno-
type because the point of injury in virus-associated AA in
humans is probably distal to the most primitive stem cell,
suggested by the normal number and maintenance of other
stem cell–derived compartments such as lymphocytes and
osteoclasts in these patients (2).
1917 Binder et al.
Systemic Activation of Virus-specific CTLs. Lacking the most
important CTL effector function for LCMV elimination,
P0/0 mice are, in a certain way, immunodeficient animals.
In P0/0 mice, LCMV replicates in many mesenchymal and
epithelial cells, leading to systemic expansion of CD8ϩ T
cells not only in the BM, but also in other organs (liver,
brain, etc.). Due to lack of contact-dependent cytotoxicity
of virus-specific CD8ϩ T cells, necrosis of tissue and solid
organ disease is absent (27). Virus-associated human AA is
dissimilar in that respect because hepatitis is usually preva-
lent in individuals with a normal immune status and it is
thought that damaging CTLs localize more specifically to
the BM in the course of the disease (8). However, observa-
tions in wt C57BL/6 mice limit the interpretation of AA in
P0/0 mice only with respect to disease intensity and kinetics
for the following reasons. Similar to P0/0 mice, suppression
of BM function is also seen in wt C57BL/6 mice with a la-
tency of ‫1ف‬ wk (days 16–22) after LCMV-induced hepati-
tis when the correct viral inoculation dose and LCMV
strain is chosen (LCMV-Docile, 104 PFU). Although ‫%01ف‬
of infected mice die, LCMV infection does not cause AA
consistently in C57BL/6 mice and most animals show only
a mild decrease of the CBCs that is transient and reversible
after LCMV has been cleared.
Cytokine Profile of CTLs. A remarkable discordance is
observed in the profile of secreted cytokines by CD8ϩ T
cells; in contrast to T cells of patients with AA, overpro-
duction of TNF/LT-␣ by LCMV-specific CTLs is not de-
tected, although TNF/LT-␣ concentrations in serum of
LCMV-infected P0/0 and P0/0/TNFR10/0 mice are in-
creased. Because the viral Ags are not known, human T
cell clones obtained by stimulation of BM cells with lectins
usually exhibit strong NK activity in vitro (40). Thus, TNF/
LT-␣ release in these experiments may not directly reflect a
product of MHC-restricted T cells, but could be due to an
enhanced release from secondary cells, such as NK cells, in-
duced via IFN-␥ from virus-specific CTLs (52). In contrast,
cytokine secretion in LCMV-infected P0/0 mice is highly Ag
specific and MHC restricted because only CD8ϩ T cells
recognizing the immunodominant epitope derived from
LCMV-GP presented on H-2b secrete IFN-␥.
Other Models of AA. Currently, there is no murine
model describing an irreversible BM aplasia caused by vi-
rus-specific CD8ϩ T cells that exhibits disease characteris-
tics comparable to human virus–associated AA. Immuno-
logically mediated AA can be induced experimentally in
irradiated recipient mice by infusion of lymph node cells
from H-2–syngeneic but Mls-mismatched donors (57). In
another system, small doses of purified unprimed CD4ϩ
cells are transferred into lightly irradiated recipients expressing
MHC class II (I-A) differences. The donor CD4ϩ cells cause
destruction of the BM and it has been concluded that
CD4ϩ T cells induce AA via I-A–restricted CTL activity
through recognition of I-A expression on stem cells (58).
Both disease models, however, correspond best to BM
aplasia as a consequence of a chronic graft versus host dis-
ease and therefore, the mechanism of development of dis-
ease may be dissimilar from virus-associated AA in humans.
Implications for Human AA. LCMV-infected P0/0 mice
seem a valid system to explore the pathogenesis of virus-
associated AA, the natural course of the disease, and the
conditions allowing its spontaneous recovery. Because the
disease incidence is 100% with a highly predictable time
course not only in tg, but also in non-tg animals, the con-
tribution of distinct subpopulations of virus-specific lym-
phocytes to disease can clearly be dissected. In addition,
mice are the natural host and reservoir of LCMV (29, 59).
Therefore, the mechanism of disease described here may
offer explanations for hematopoietic disease also in other
arenavirus infections such as Junin and Tamiami viruses, in
which destruction and widespread loss of hematopoietic
tissue is observed (60). The network of growth factors and
inhibitors that governs proliferation and maturation of he-
matopoietic cells is very complex due to synergistic, over-
lapping and counterregulatory bioactivities of cytokines.
Additional inhibitory factors produced by BM stroma (e.g.,
macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]-1␣ [61] or TGF-␤
[62]) may be involved in AA of LCMV-infected P0/0 mice
and have not been studied here. Our experiments suggest
that progressive BM failure and functional exhaustion of virus-
specific CD8ϩ T cells are ruled by distinct pathogenetic
mechanisms during persistent virus infections. Consequently,
in virus-induced AA, the final outcome of a life-long virus
carrier state or mortality of the host may be the result of a
mutual competition between loss of the hematopoietic stem
cells versus loss of damaging virus-specific T cells. Absence of
one toxic CD8ϩ T cell–dependent cytokine, such as TNF/
LT-␣ or IFN-␥, shifts this lethal balance and rescues BM
function. This mechanism of peripheral tolerance induction
may explain why rare patients survive AA and remission to
normal blood cell values can “naturally” occur (2). Persistent
expression of viral Ag in stromal and dendritic cells in the
spatially limited microenvironment of the BM efficiently
sustains local infiltration with CD8ϩ T cells and causes AA
via bystander destruction of blood cell precursors by T cell–
secreted cytokines. These concepts of nonbalanced antiviral
immunity causing hematopoietic disease may possibly be
generalized to other viruses that are noncytopathic for blood
cell progenitors and predominantly infect the stroma (5, 6)
or other, not yet defined cellular targets in the BM (8, 9).
