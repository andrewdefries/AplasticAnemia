Abstract
Introduction: Dubowitz syndrome is a very rare, autosomal recessive disease characterized by microcephaly,
growth retardation, a high sloping forehead, facial asymmetry, blepharophimosis, sparse hair and eyebrows, low-set
ears and mental retardation. Symptoms vary between patients, but other characteristics include a soft high-pitched
voice, dental and craniofacial abnormalities, partial webbing of the fingers and toes, palate deformations, genital
abnormalities, eczema, hyperactivity, preference for concrete over abstract thinking, language difficulties and an
aversion to crowds.
Case presentation: We describe the craniofacial and dental characteristics of a 12-year-old Caucasian Italian boy
with both the typical and less common findings of Dubowitz syndrome.
Conclusion: Diagnosis of Dubowitz syndrome is mainly based on the facial phenotype. Possible conditions for
differential diagnosis include Bloom syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, and fetal alcohol syndrome. As there
are few reports of this syndrome in the literature, we hope this case report will enable health professionals to
recognize the phenotypic alterations of this syndrome, and allow early referral for the necessary multidisciplinary
treatments.
Introduction
Dubowitz syndrome (DS) was initially confused with
Bloom syndrome until it was recognized as a separate
condition in 1971 [1]. The two conditions share the com-
mon features of pre-natal and post-natal growth failure,
microcephaly, high-pitched voice, skin changes (eczema-
tous), cancer predilection and immune deficiency [1].
Children with DS have an unusual facial appearance,
mental disability with hyperactivity, and feeding problems
during infancy, with overt or submucous cleft palate in
35% of patients [1,2]. Progressive scoliosis [3] and achala-
sia [4] have also been reported. Neoplasms associated
with DS include leukemia, lymphoma, and neuroblas-
toma [5].
DS is an autosomal recessive condition (OMIM data-
base entry no. 223370) [6]. The specific gene mutation
responsible for DS has not yet been identified.
Preventive management of DS should include moni-
toring of early feeding, evaluation of hypospadia or cryp-
torchidism (present in 70% of boys with DS), audiology
and middle ear examinations, and intervention in early
childhood to optimize potential in children with an IQ
of 80-90 [5]. Intelligence varies from severe retardation
to average levels. Developmental disabilities include
delayed speech (60%) and hyperactivity (40%) [1,2,7].
Peripheral blood counts should be obtained in children
with infectious illness or fatigue, as aplastic anemias
have also been described [1,2].
The objective of this report was to clarify the particu-
lar characteristics of a patient with DS, and highlight
the importance of early recognition of this condition.
Case presentation
A 12-year-old Caucasian Italian boy with DS presented
to our institution for a dental examination. The diagno-
sis of DS had previously been made at a hospital where
a multidisciplinary group was monitoring our patient.
As stated earlier, the facial phenotype is the primary
basis for diagnosis of DS. When we examined our patient,
we found a number of clinical anomalies, including a
small head, frontal bossing, low-set ears, saddle nose, tri-
angular face, and the characteristic facial features of DS
such as palpebral ptosis, hypertelorism and micrognathia.

Multiple nevi were also seen. Mild mental retardation was
present, and our patient’s voice was high-pitched.
We reviewed our patient’s medical history. Laboratory
studies carried out included routine blood counts and
chemistry tests, thyroid function tests, a sweat test and
chromosomal analysis, which had all given normal
results. Our patient had previously undergone surgery to
correct a cleft palate. Congenital intra-atrial and intra-
ventricular defects were present, such as a cataract that
was also treated surgically. Radiographs of the lumbar
column indicated a right convex scoliosis. However,
some of the previously reported anomalies in DS were
absent.
During the odontological evaluation we took a full
medical history from our patient, and he underwent
clinical and imaging examinations. The radiological
examination included panoramic, anteroposterior and
lateral views of the skull, and hand and wrist radio-
graphs. We also carried out an auxological examination,
and found that our patient’s bone age was compatible
with his chronological age (verified by assessment of the
radiographs of the hand and wrist), but his ponderal
growth was delayed (Figure 1). The oral clinical exami-
nation revealed the absence of both the lower and upper
right canines, delayed eruption and rotation of the lower
incisors due to deciduous incipient cavities (Figure 2),
and a high, narrow palate (Figure 3).
Based on the panoramic radiograph, our patient pre-
sented with chronologically delayed eruption and radi-
cular abnormalities of the second molars (Figure 4).
Anteroposterior radiological sinonasal findings showed
hypoplastic frontal sinuses and mild nasal septum devia-
tion (Figure 5). In addition lateral radiography views of
our patient’s skull showed skeletal class II, ethmoid cell
hypoplasia, frontal bone thickness, a normal maxillary
sinus and mild hyperostosis frontalis (Figure 6).
Discussion
The overall incidence of DS has not been established,
but it is very rare. Approximately 150 cases have been
reported in the literature, with various other associated
anomalies [1,2]. Most of the cases have been reported in
the USA, Europe, Middle East and Russia, as well as
Japan [8]. It appears to affect both sexes and all ethnici-
ties equally.
The most common physical characteristics associated
with DS are growth retardation, a characteristic facial
appearance and microcephaly [9,10]. Growth retardation
is usually due to growth hormone (GH) deficiency, and
could be due to gene mutations or disruption of brain
structures during development [10,11]. GH deficiency
also has a correlation with low levels of IgG, which are
also found in patients with DS [11]. An MRI study of a
patient with DS with GH deficiency revealed congenital
midline abnormalities including corpus callosum dys-
genesis, and hypoplastic anterior pituitary gland and
stalk, with an ectopic neurohypophysis [12].
The diagnostic phenotypic features of DS in our
patient included small low-set ears, saddle nose, triangu-
lar face, mental retardation, abnormal high-pitched
voice, hypertelorism, cataract, cardiological features and

to chronological age.

scoliosis. In a review on 141 individuals with DS, facial
anomalies were suggested to be the most diagnostic of
the physical signs [1]. Of the 141 patients, 15 had a nor-
mal appearance. Microcephaly was present in 112
patients, blepharophimosis in 60 and ptosis in 53. The
authors considered a prominent round nose tip, noted
in 17 of their 34 cases, to be especially characteristic of
DS at a young age.
To the best of our knowledge, our case report is only
the second study to detail the specific oral features of a
single patient [13]. A wide array of characteristics can
be present. Multiple dental carious lesions are found in
the majority of cases [1]. Other dental features include
retarded eruption, microdontia, malocclusion, diastema
and fusion of dental elements, and anodontia of the cen-
tral incisors is generally present [1]. Oral features

include a small oral cavity, thin upper lip border, promi-
nent philtrum, narrow and deep palate, palatine cleft,
submucosal palatine cleft, split uvula, micrognathia,
prognathism and retrognathism [1,2] In 1990, velophar-
yngeal insufficiency was described for the first time [14].
Our patient presented with the typical oral alterations of
cleft palate, incipient cavities, retarded eruption and
malocclusion.
Other physical problems caused by DS, such as ble-
pharoptosis or cardiovascular defects, can be corrected
through surgery [10]. A number of behavioral character-
istics have been reported by parents of children with
DS, and described in the medical literature [2,7,15-17].
These include extreme hyperactivity and language diffi-
culties [17,18].
DS has autosomal recessive inheritance [15]. In 2 of 15
familial cases, the parents were consanguineous [19,20].
Several cases of DS have been found to occur in monozy-
gotic twins, siblings and cousins [6]. Affected siblings
have been described in nine families, with both sexes
affected. One set of concordantly affected monozygotic
twins has been reported. In a set of dizygotic twins, only
one twin was affected [1]. A few authors have suggested
that DS may represent another disorder caused by an
alteration in sterol synthesis, transport or metabolism
[21]. Recently, a case of DS with persistently low choles-
terol levels has been described [22]. This finding corre-
lates with findings in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome
(SLOS), one of the conditions considered in the differen-
tial diagnosis of DS. Patients with SLOS and DS have
common clinical features, and both conditions have
therefore been hypothesized to be linked to a defect in
the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway [21,22]. SLOS is
caused by mutations in the DHCR7 gene, which makes
an enzyme called 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase [23].
Mutations in the DHCR7 gene reduce or eliminate the
activity of this enzyme, preventing cells from producing
sufficient cholesterol [23,24]. A lack of this enzyme also
allows potentially toxic byproducts of cholesterol produc-
tion to build up in the blood and other tissues [24]. The
combination of low cholesterol levels and an accumula-
tion of other substances is likely to disrupt the growth
and development of many body systems [24]. However, it
is not known how this disturbance in cholesterol produc-
tion leads to the specific features of SLOS [23,24].
Although there is considerable evidence pointing to
the genetic basis of this disorder, the symptoms that are
expressed are very similar to fetal alcohol syndrome
(FAS), and further studies need to be performed to
determine whether this environmental agent has an
effect on the expression of the genotype [16]. Clinically,
children diagnosed with FAS vary greatly in symptom
presentation, probably due to the amount of alcohol and
timing of exposure, as well as maternal and genetic
influences; however, no genetic markers have yet been
found, except in mouse models [25-28]. All these factors
play a role in determining the mechanisms through
which alcohol damages the developing brain, the details
of which are still largely unknown [26,28,29].
One of the symptoms of DS is the breakdown of chro-
mosomes [24], and it therefore needs to be differentiated
from Bloom syndrome (BS) [1,2]. BS is the prototype of
the class of human diseases referred to as ‘chromosome
breakage syndromes’ [30]. The cytogenetic features of BS
cells in mitosis are increased numbers of chromatid gaps,
breaks and rearrangements, and increased numbers of
quadriradial configurations [31]. A greatly increased fre-
quency of sister chromatid exchanges in cells exposed to
bromodeoxyuridine is diagnostic; BS is the only disorder
in which such evidence of hyper-recombination is known
to occur [32]. Mutations in the BLM gene, which is a
member of the DNA helicase family, are associated with
BS [33-38]. DNA helicases are enzymes that unwind the
two strands of a duplex DNA molecule [33,34]. A second
mutation segregating among the Ashkenazi Jewish popu-
lation, insT2407, has been identified (Bloom’s Syndrome
Registry, unpublished data). The greatly elevated rate of
mutation in BS results in a high risk of cancer in affected
individuals [39]. The cancer predisposition is character-
ized by (i) a wide range of cancer types, including leuke-
mias, lymphomas, and carcinomas; (ii) an early age of
onset relative to the same cancer in the general popula-
tion; and (iii) multiplicity [40]. The average age of cancer
diagnosis in patients with BS is approximately 25 years,
but cancer may develop at any age. A previous report has
described co-occurrence of embryonal rhabdomyosar-
coma and multiple spontaneous chromosome breaks; in
that case, the tumor was resected, but recurred, resulting
in the child’s death at three months of age [37].
Conclusion
Because the genetic cause of BS is not known, there is
no specific medical test that can definitively assign the
diagnosis. The diagnosis is usually based on the charac-
teristic facial appearance of the affected individual, and
on other factors such as growth data and medical
history. The diagnosis is easily missed if the physician
is not familiar with genetic pediatric conditions.
Early diagnosis is essential, as the prognosis for patients
with DS is good provided that management of their med-
ical conditions is initiated early and maintained through-
out life. Patients with DS can be expected to survive to
adulthood and lead a fairly normal lifestyle, although
most have some level of mental retardation. DS involves
various systems, including the stomatognathic system,
emphasizing one of the reasons why it is important for
health professionals to recognize the characteristics and
consequently refer such patients for the necessary

useful in the identification of a genetic marker for DS
syndrome or for the discovery of novel pathways that
may be involved in its origin.
