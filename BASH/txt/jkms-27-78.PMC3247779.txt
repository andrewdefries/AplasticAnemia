Assessment of Serologic Immunity to Diphtheria-Tetanus-
Pertussis After Treatment of Korean Pediatric Hematology and
Oncology Patients
The aim of this study was to investigate the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis antibody titers
after antineoplastic treatment and to suggest an appropriate vaccination approach for
pediatric hemato-oncologic patients. A total of 146 children with either malignancy in
remission after cessation of therapy or bone marrow failure were recruited. All children had
received routine immunization including diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccination
before diagnosis of cancer. The serologic immunity to diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis was
classified as: completely protective, partially protective, or non-protective. Non-protective
serum antibody titer for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis was detected in 6.2%, 11.6%,
and 62.3% of patients, respectively, and partial protective serum antibody titer for
diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis was seen in 37%, 28.1%, and 8.9% of patients. There
was no significant correlation between the severity of immune defect and age, gender or
underlying disease. Revaccination after antineoplastic therapy showed significantly higher
levels of antibody for each vaccine antigen. Our data indicates that a large proportion of
children lacked protective serum concentrations of antibodies against diphtheria, tetanus,
and pertussis. This suggests that reimmunization of these patients is necessary after
completion of antineoplastic treatment. Also, prospective studies should be undertaken
with the aim of devising a common strategy of revaccination.

INTRODUCTION
Outcome and long-term survival of pediatric patients with ma-
lignancies have improved markedly, enabling children to lead
a normal life (1). The threat of infectious diseases, however, re-
mains imminent. This increased risk is due to secondary immu-
nodeficiency caused by malignancy and its treatment, which
may include the loss of vaccine-induced antibodies and immu-
nologicalmemory(2-4).Theresultingsusceptibilitytoinfectious
diseases increases morbidity and mortality in pediatric hema-
tology andoncologypatients.Unfortunately,itisuncleartodate
whether and to what extent the host defense against vaccine-
preventablediseaseaftertheendoftreatmentiseffective,which,
in turn, has an important impact on preventive strategies. Nev-
ertheless, these studies in patients with malignancies have not
been conducted in Korea before.
  Withawarenessoftheemergingpresenceofvaccine-prevent-
able diseases in the general population in recent years, we be-
lieveditwasnecessarytoascertainthelevelofprotectionagainst
these diseases in our patients. We focused on the assessment of
serologic immunity against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis to
determine whether these patients are in danger of acquiring
these infections when naturally exposed. We further sought to
investigate the level to which the generally proposed catch-up
vaccinationscheduleswerecompletedinourpatientsaftertreat-
ment and determine the factors in patient history that may have
affected serologic protection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
We conducted a retrospective trial to assess the immunity of
diphtheria, tetatnus and pertussis. To determine the influence
of the antineoplastic treatment, we compared antibody status
to the previously published data on immunocompetent Korean
children(5).Forfurtherevaluationpatientsweredividedaccord-

Patient population
Atotalof146patientsaged1-17yroldwhohadbeentreatedsuc-
cessfully for pediatric hematologic malignancies, solid tumors,
and bone marrow failure were recruited. They had all been di-
agnosedandreceivedtreatmentattheDepartmentofPediatrics,
Seoul St. Mary’s hospital, which is a tertiary referral center for
pediatric cancers in Seoul. All patients were in remission at the
time of study. Before the primary diagnosis, all the children had
been immunized against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis ac-
cording to the Korean national immunization program, with at
least three doses of DTaP vaccines within the first year of life.
Exclusion criteria included: 1) patients who developed relapse
of primary disease or secondary malignancies during the study
period; 2) patients who were still receiving systemic steroid for
their primary disease or other conditions; and 3) patients with
a past history of those listed vaccine-preventable diseases.
Antibody assays
Serum antibody concentrations were measured for the follow-
ing antigens: diphtheria toxoid (DT); tetanus toxoid (TT) and
pertussis toxin (PT). Commercially available kits were used for
thedeterminationofantibodytiters.Serumlevelsofspecificanti-
bodies to diphtheria, tetanus and anti-PT antibody were mea-
sured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (IBL,
Hamburg, Germany). The thresholds for complete, partial and
non protection were taken from national recommendations,
literature and manufacturer’s guidelines. Levels less than 0.01
IU/mL for anti-DT and anti-TT were interpreted as non-protec-
tive level, and levels less than 16 EU/mL for anti-PT as non-pro-
tective level.Fordiphtheriaandtetanus,titersof0.01tolessthan
0.1 IU/mL were considered to produce a partial protection, and
titers 0.1 IU/mL or greater were deemed to provide complete
protection. For pertussis, antibody levels 24 EU/mL or greater
were considered as completely protective, and 16 to less than
24 EU/mL as partially protective.
Statistical analysis
Antibody titers of patient groups and controls were compared
withStudent’st-test.Themethodsofchi-squaretestandFisher’s
exact test were applied for comparing seropositive proportions
between the groups. Data were analyzed using SPSS statistical
software, version 13.0 for Windows (Chicago, IL, USA). P values
less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant through-
out analysis.
Ethics statement
This study protocol was approved by the institutional review
board (IRB) of Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital (IRB approval number:
KC10PISV0432). Patients and/or their parents gave informed
written consent prior to study.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Atotal146patientswererecruitedinthestudy.Thedemographic
and clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1.
The current study included 89 males and 57 females with a me-
dian age at enrollment of 11.6 ± 3.6 yr old (range, 3-17 yr). One
hundredthirty-sevenpatients(93.8%)hadhematologicdiseases,
including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in 83 patients,
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 39 patients, aplastic anemia
in11patientsandchronicmyeloidleukemia(CML)in4patients.
Nine patients (6.2%) had been treated for solid tumors includ-
ing 6 for Hodgkin lymphoma, 2 for neuroblastoma, 1 for Wilms’
tumor. Amongst all patients, 92 patients had received chemo-
therapy alone, while 54 patients had also undergone hemato-
poieticstemcelltransplantation(HSCT).Antibodytitersfordiph-
theria,tetanus,andpertussisweremeasured3-138monthsafter
the end of treatment.
Immunity to diphtheria
Only 56.8% of the patients had completely protective levels of
diphtheria antibody. The percentage of patients with non-pro-
tective antibodytodiphtheriawas6.2%;and37%ofparticipants
were partially protectective. In comparison with the previous
publisheddatainage-matched,healthyKoreanchildren(Group

nificantly different according to underlying disease of the pa-
tient. Analysis of patients who had received chemotherapy only
compared with those who had received HSCT again showed no
significant differences. The patients who had received DTaP or
diphtheria-tetanus (Td) vaccines after completion of therapy
were significantly more likely than patients lacking post-treat-
ment reimmunization to have higher protective concentration
of diphtheria antibody (P = 0.001).
Immunity to tetanus
Sixty percent of the patients had protective levels of antibody to
tetanus. The percentage of patients with non-protective anti-
body to tetanus was 11.6%; and 28.1% of participants were par-
tially protective. A comparative analysis with the immunocom-
petent group revealed a significant decline in seropositive rate
against tetanus in our cohort (Fig. 1).
  Aswasseenwithdiphtheriaantibody,protectivelevelsofanti-
body to tetanus did not differ according to sex and age. Under-
lying diseasedidnotsignificantlyinfluenceantibodylevels.There
were no significant differences between patients treated with
chemotherapy alone and those treated by HSCT with regards
toantibodylevelstotetanus.Oncomparingthereimmunization
group with the non-reimmunization group after treatment, we
found a significantly higher number of patients presenting with
complete protection to tetanus in the reimmunization group
(P < 0.001). Among patients in the reimmunization group, the
proportion of those with protective levels of antibody remained
stable at approximately 80% (Table 2).
Immunity to pertussis
Only twenty-eight percent of the patients had protective levels
of anti-PT antibody to pertussis. The percentage of patients with
non-protective antibody to pertussis was 62.3%; and 8.9% of
participants were partially protectective. The previous data for
healthy children revealed that the seroprotection rate against
pertussis accounted for 72.4%, whereas the percentage of pro-
tective levels significantly dropped to 28.8% in our patients (Fig.
1, P < 0.001).
  There was no statistically significant difference in antibody
levels with respect to sex and age. The seropositivity of pertussis
also did not differ according to underlying disease. The patients
who completed chemotherapy only had a lower protective an-
tibody levels than HSCT patients had (P = 0.039).
  The disparity in levels of protective antibody between the re-
immunization group and non-reimmunization group that had
been evident for diphtheria and tetanus was not shown for per-
tussis. The proportion of patients in recipients of DTaP or Td af-
ter completion of therapy with protective levels of antibody to
pertussis was not different from the patients in non-reimmuni-
zation group (Table 2).

ease may result in secondary immunodeficiency (6, 7). Owing
to the reconstituting immune system, these patients are at risk
ofacquiringavarietyofinfectiousdiseases(8,9).Therecentout-
breaks of vaccine preventable disease as well as the increase of
pertussis in immunocompetent individuals further address the
need for protective strategy in children with hemato-oncologic
illnesses (10-15). We therefore assessed the serologic immunity
against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis antigens in a total of
146 children treated for malignancy. In a previous study that we
performed at St. Mary’s hospital and published in 2008, we have
demonstrated the seroprotective rate of diphtheria, tetanus and
pertussis in healthy Korean children (5). In this study, we com-
paredtheantibodylevelsinourpatientgrouptothoseofahealthy
historical cohort in order to assess the immunity created by pre-
vious vaccinations after therapy. Notably, in the majority of pa-
tients these antibody levels were below the presumed threshold
ofprotectionforeachantigen.Comparedwithpreviousdatafrom
age-matched normal populations in Korea who had been im-
munized according to the same schedule, rates of completely
protective immunity in our cohort were decreased by 31.5% for
diphtheria, 24.9% for tetanus and 43.6% for pertussis, respective-
ly. These data suggest that pediatric patients who had under-
gone treatment for cancer are highly susceptible to these infec-
tions when naturally exposed. Our findings are consistent with
other published data. In the report by van der Hardt et al. (16),
more than 50% of patients lacked protective immunity against
diphtheriaandtetanusafterantineoplastictherapy.Eketal.(17)
found that only 17% of ALL patients had complete protection
againstdiphtheriaand33%againsttetanusaftertreatment.Small
et al. (18) reported that more than 30% of autologous peripheral
blood stem cell transplantation recipients lacked pertussis im-
munity.
  Wefurthertriedtodeterminefactorsinfluencingthelowsero-
logic immunityofourpatients.Somestudieshavedemonstrated
that young age is associated with more profound immune ab-
normalities,includinglossofantibodiestovaccineantigens(19-
21). In our study, however, age did not have any effect on sero-
logic immunity to each antigen. Patient gender and the type of
malignancy also did not appear to influence immunity to the
vaccine antigens studied.
  Thisstudyalsoemphasizescomparisonsofimmunitybetween
the chemotherapy group and the HSCT group. It is worth not-
ingthatimmunitytodiphtheriaandtetanusinpatientswhohad
completedchemotherapyonlyshowednosignificantdifferences
when compared to that of HSCT recipients. In addition, pertus-
sis immunity decreased significantly morein the chemotherapy
group than in the HSCT group. This latter finding may be attrib-
utable to widespread use of reimmunization after HSCT. There
are well-established recommendations for reimmunizations
after HSCT, but no consensus still exists regarding whether re-
immunizationsarenecessaryafterstandardchemotherapy,and
when such reimmunizations should take place (22, 23). A few
cohort studies were published to address changes of antibody
titers and response to booster vaccine after chemotherapy (24-
26). On the basis of our data, we agree with the strategy of reim-
munizing each patient who completed chemotherapy only, as
well as HSCT recipients. Underestimation of the need for reim-
munizationmaycontributetothespreadofvaccinepreventable
diseases such as pertussis in society. Important questions that
remain unanswered include the best strategy for managing chil-
drenwhohavecompletedchemotherapy.Zignoletal.whostud-
ied humoral immunity against tetanus, measles, polio, hepatitis
B, mumps, rubella in pediatric cancer patients recommended a
boosterdose12monthsaftercompletionofchemotherapy (19).
Patel et al. suggested a simple schedule of one booster dose at 6
months after completion of leukemia therapy (25). The propos-
al by Fioredda et al. was to continue the regular vaccination
schedule according to age (27). Efforts to find a common strat-
egy should form the core of future studies.
  On comparing the reimmunization group and the non-reim-
munization group after treatment, the proportion of patients
with protective immunity remained significantly higher in the
reimmunization group both for diphtheria (72.9%) and for teta-
nus (79.7%). However, this difference was not observed for per-
tussis antibody. This finding reflects the high level of coverage
made possible by reimmunization and the requirement that a
booster dose of vaccine be given after completion of treatment.
Although some of patients were administered reimmunization
using DTaP according to age, this finding also suggests that cov-
erage with only Td can be incomplete with regards to pertussis.
There are few studies on pertussis immunity following antineo-
plastic therapy and on the immunogenicity of Tdap in such pa-
tients; one study showed that HSCT recipients have lower levels
of pertussis antibody and an inadequate response of Tdap vac-
cination (18). Ongoing prospective study will assist in answer-
ing whether observed differences in pertussis immunity can be
affected by reimmunization using the newly approved Tdap.
  Some limitations of our study must be considered. First, our
study has a cross-sectional design, which does not allow us to
drawcausalrelationships.Theweakseropositivityinthechemo-
therapy only group may also be attributable to other factors, in-
cluding the interval between cessation of treatment and anti-
bodyassessment,asissuggestedforchildrenwhoreceivedtrans-
plants. We did not have information about antibody levels be-
fore treatment to strongly support the idea that the low seropos-
itivity to various vaccine antigens was due only to immunosup-
pressive effect of therapy. Second, we did not universally test for
hypogammaglobulinemia, which may have affected responses.
Third, chemotherapy was not classified according to intensity
of regimen, a variable which has a significant effect on immune
reconstitution. These limitations need to be addressed in future
studies.

  In summary, we have shown that a substantial proportion of
pediatric patients with malignancies who had completed treat-
ment did not have antibody levels that are protective against
diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. The current recommenda-
tions by the Korean national immunization program suggest
reimmunization of HSCT recipients. Our findings support this
reimmunization practice. In addition, although the principle of
reimmunization of patients after chemotherapy for malignancy
is not universally accepted, these patients also lacked protective
serum levels in a manner similar to those who had undergone
HSCT, especially against pertussis. Children who demonstrate
a defective response to common pediatric vaccines should be
evaluated, and revaccinated if indicated, to ensure that these
children maintain protective antibody responses. For example,
the use of Tdap by a booster vaccine may be one alternative that
could be studied further. Future prospective studies should aim
towards creating a consensus for modified dosing and reimmu-
nization schedules after treatment for malignancies.
