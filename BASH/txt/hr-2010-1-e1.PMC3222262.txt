Abstract
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) represents
one of the most challenging health-related
problems in the elderly. Characterized by dys-
plastic morphology in the bone marrow in asso-
ciation with ineffective hematopoiesis, patho-
physiological causes of this disease are diverse
including genetic abnormalities within myeloid
progenitors, altered epigenetics, and changes
in the bone marrow microenvironment. The
concept that T-cell mediated autoimmunity
contributes to bone marrow failure has been
widely accepted due to hematologic improve-
ment after immunosuppressive therapy (IST)
in a subset of patients. Currently, IST for MDS
primarily involves anti-thymocyte globulin
(ATG)-based regimens in which responsive-
ness is strongly associated with younger
(under 60 years) age at disease onset. In such
cases, progressive cytopenia may occur as a
consequence of expanded self-reactive CD8+
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that suppress
hematopoietic progenitors. Although most
hematologists agree that IST can offer durable
hematologic remission in younger patients
with MDS, an international clinical study and a
better understanding of the molecular mecha-
nisms contributing to the expansion of self-
reactive CTLs is crucial. In this review, data
accumulated in the US, Europe, and Asia will be
summarized to provide insight and direction
for a multi-center international trial.
Overview of myelodysplastic
syndrome
Incidence
Idiopathic MDS, as opposed to treatment-
related MDS, occurs with higher incidence in
older individuals in the Western world.1,2 In the
United States, the incidence of MDS from 2001
to 2003 was recently established from popula-
tion-based cancer registries from the National
Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results (SEER) Program and North
American Association of Central Cancer
Registries (NAACCR) databases and showed
that the overall incidence is 3.4 per 100,000
(4.5 in men and 2.7 in women). The median
age at diagnosis was 76 years, with 86% of
cases over 60 years of age.3,4 Among racial
groups in the US, white individuals had the
highest incidence rate (3.5/100,000 in Whites)
followed by African Americans (3.0/100,000),
native Americans (1.3/100,000) and Asians
and Pacific Islanders (2.6/100,000).3,4
Compared to the median age in the US, the
median age of patients with MDS in Asian and
African countries is younger (50 and 60 years
old, respectively).5-11
Current classification systems
To account for heterogeneity within this dis-
ease, in the past few decades the MDS classifi-
cation system was evolved. In 1982, the
French-American-British (FAB) classification
system was established,12 which was later
refined to the World Health Organization
(WHO) subtyping.13,14 And recently, the WHO
classification was revised as the following
groups: (1) refractory cytopenia with unilin-
eage dysplasia (RCUD) that includes refracto-
ry anemia (RA), refractory neutropenia (RN),
and refractory thrombocytopenia (RT); (2)
refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts
(RARS); (3) refractory anemia with multilin-
eage dysplasia (RCMD); (4) refractory anemia
with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1); (5) refractory
anemia with excess blasts-2 (RAEB-2); (6)
myelodysplastic syndrome, unclassified (MDS-
U); (7) MDS associated with isolated del(5q);
and (8) refractory cytopenia of childhood
(RCC) as a group of provisional entities. Major
points of the modification are the following:
(1) patients who lack convincing morphologi-
cal dysplasia but have specific MDS-related
cytogenetic abnormalities have presumptive
evidence of MDS; (2) refractory neutropenia
and thrombocytopenia are added, along with
refractory anemia, to the category of RCUD;
(3) patients with dysplasia and <5% bone mar-
row (BM) blasts but ≥2% in the peripheral
blood (PB) are classified RAEB1, and (4) a pro-
visional entity, Refractory Cytopenia of
Childhood (RCC) has been added; distinguish-
ing RCC from aplastic anemia (AA) can be dif-
ficult.
The International Prognostic Scoring
System (IPSS) was introduced as a universal
risk stratification system for treatment deci-
sion making.1 IPSS considers the percentage
of marrow blasts, the number of cytopenias,
and bone marrow cytogenetics to predict sur-
vival and progression to AML. Patients with
untreated MDS are categorized into four IPSS
prognostic risk groups; low, intermediate-1
(Int-1), intermediate-2 (Int-2), and high-risk
with median survival estimates of 5.7, 3.5, 1.2,
and 0.4 years, respectively. The risk of AML
evolution of 25% of patients was determined to
be 9.4 (low-risk), 3.3 (Int-1), 1.1 (Int-2), and
0.2 (high-risk) years, respectively.
The IPSS system was designed to be applied
only at diagnosis in patients with de novo MDS
and may not be suitable for serial assessment
of patients whose disease evolves over time.
Recently, the WHO classification-based prog-
nostic scoring system (WPSS) was proposed to
estimate survival and risk of AML transforma-
tion at multiple time points during the natural
course of MDS. The WPSS score integrates the
three most important prognostic factors in
MDS patients classified according to WHO cri-
teria: karyotype, WHO subgroup, and require-
ment for RBC transfusion as an indicator of
symptomatic anemia. In contrast with the four
risk groups identified by the IPSS, the WPSS
stratifies MDS patients into five different risk
categories: very low (score=0), low (1), inter-
mediate (2), high (3-4), or very high (5-6).
Significant differences can be seen among the
five groups in overall survival (P<0.0001) and
risk of AML transformation (P<0.0001). In an
independent cohort of patients with MDS,
median survival ranged from 140 months for
patients with a score of 0 to ten months for
those with a score of 5 or more. The most sig-
nificant improvement in prognostic stratifica-
tion compared with IPSS is observed in
patients without excess blasts, primarily due to
the strong impact of the number of dysplastic
lineages and transfusion dependency.
Kantarjian et al. also proposed a new risk
model in MDS that accounts for events not con-
sidered in the original IPSS. They analyzed
1,915 patients with MDS including secondary
MDS and CMML. Only 507 patients (26%) could
be classified by the IPSS.15 A multivariate sur-
vival analysis identified a myelodysplastic syn-
drome risk score (Table 1). Four prognostic risk
groups are proposed for the new risk model: (1)
low-risk (score 0-4: 16% of patients), in which
patients have an estimated median survival of
54 months and a 3-year survival rate of 63%; (2)
intermediate-1 risk (score 5-6; 24% of patients),

Immunological pathophysiology
Overview
Various pathological disturbances have been
linked to the etiology of MDS including genes
that are involved in cell cycle control, DNA
repair, gene transcription, telomere length and
other chromosome abnormalities, mitotic
checkpoints, cell growth, apoptosis, and cell dif-
ferentiation and maturation.16-21 In response to
this pleiotropic biology, several therapeutic
options have been developed in recent years
including azacitidine,22 decitabine,23,24 and
lenalidomide.25-27 Information from the treat-
ment of patients with these newer agents has
influenced the opinion of investigators about
the underlying pathogenesis of MDS.
Dysregulation of immunity in tri-
somy 8 myelodysplastic syndrome
T-cell immune dysregulation is definitely
associated with bone marrow failure in AA and
large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGLL),
which share several clinical features with MDS.
Historically, IST in MDS has been applied in
cases with bone marrow hypocellularity; a clini-
cal feature that is commonly associated with AA
and observed in approximately 15% of MDS
cases.28 Numerous abnormalities in immune
function appear to contribute to impaired
hematopoiesis including elevated plasma levels
of several cytokines such as tumor necrosis fac-
tor-alpha (TNF-α)29,30 and interferon-gamma
(IFN-γ),31 which are well-known contributors to
AA pathogenesis. Many investigators have now
confirmed that cytopenias are corrected by T-
cell depleting immunotherapy in some MDS
patients.32-35 From data in vitro and in vivo, the
current consensus is that a few autologous T
cells directly suppress erythroid (CFU-E) and
granulocytic (CFU-GM) progenitor cell differen-
tiation.36
A hallmark of T-cell dominant autoimmunity
is the expansion of T-cell clones with restricted
diversity that possess a limited T-cell receptor
(TCR)-Vβ repertoire. Limitation in TCR-Vβ
complementary-determining region 3 (CDR3)
diversity and clonal expansion of T cells in asso-
ciation with bone marrow suppression suggests
that escape from peripheral tolerance and
recognition of self-antigens may contribute to
suppressive hematopoiesis. Peripheral toler-
ance may be averted by chromosomal aberra-
tions, or other disease-specific changes that
occur in the microenvironment. While the
mechanisms that underlie the generation of T-
cell clonal expansion remains elusive, Epling-
Burnette et al. showed that clonal T-cell expan-
sion occurs in 50% of MDS patients compared to
5% in healthy individuals of a similar age range.
Importantly, T-cell expansion was not restricted
to specific IPSS, WHO subtypes, age, transfu-
sion history, or karyotypes37 implying that T-cell
expansion occurs commonly among all MDS
prognostic subgroups. Sloand et al. has con-
firmed the identity of one antigen that drives
abnormal T-cell clonal expansion that con-
tributes to impaired hematopoiesis in patients
with a trisomy 8 cytogenetic abnormality.38 This
abnormality is seen in both MDS and AA and is
associated with favorable prognosis. Indicative
of underlying immune pathology, patients with
trisomy 8 display an increased frequency of
response to IST compared to patients with other
chromosomal abnormalities.38 Clonally expand-
ed CD8+ cells with reduced TCR-Vβ repertoire
diversity and direct cytotoxicity of autologous
trisomy 8 hematopoietic progenitors was
observed in vitro.39 CD8+ T-cell self-reactivity
was not observed in MDS patients with 5q- and
monosomy 7 chromosomal abnormalities.39
Bone marrow progenitors with a trisomy 8
abnormality were more sensitive to Fas-mediat-
ed apoptosis and more likely to express activat-
ed apoptotic markers such as caspases.40 In
addition, a small number of trisomy 8 cells were
present in bone marrow by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) long before cytogenetic
conversion by standard metaphase karyotyping,
suggesting that trisomy 8 aneuploidy may be an
early event in MDS. It was hypothesized that the
CTL response was initially triggered by abnor-
mal stem cells but the bone marrow failure was
subsequently mediated by a ‘bystander’ CTL
response against healthy hematopoietic cells.
The Wilms’ tumor-1 (WT1) protein, which is
localized on chromosome 8, and thus over-
expressed in MDS patients with trisomy 8, rep-
resents a well-defined target of self-reactive
CTLs in IST responsive patients.41 T cells may
undergo TCR-dependent activation in response
to the overproduction of the WT1 antigen, differ-
entiate into effector and memory cells that elicit
a WT1-specific CTL response, and as a conse-
quence lead to bone marrow failure through the
destruction of both trisomy 8 and normal
hematopoietic progenitors (HPCs). Long-term
survival of WT1-specific T cells has previously
been linked to the expression of c-myc, CD1, and
survivin (an inhibitor of apoptosis).38,42
While the linkage between immune-mediat-
ed pathogenesis and trisomy 8 is mechanisti-
cally established, this chromosomal abnormal-
ity occurs in only 5-10% of MDS patients and
more often in those that evolve from AA.
Response to IST is clearly not restricted to this
limited subpopulation of MDS patients sug-
gesting that the mechanism of immune patho-
genesis in patients without trisomy 8 must be
explored further. The role of aberrant T-cell
homeostasis and the relationship between
skewed TCR-Vβ repertoires in patients with-
out a trisomy 8 is yet to be defined. In summa-
ry, distinguishing features of trisomy 8 posi-
tive bone marrow cells may represent a distinct

pathophysiological entity associated with the
direct stimulation of CD8+ T cells that may
receive benefit from IST (Figure 1).
Search for predictive biomarkers of
immune pathophysiology
Since the mechanisms contributing to
immune pathophysiology and patient selection
criteria for IST remain elusive in patients
without trisomy 8, a search for predictive bio-
markers is critically needed. Classic paroxys-
mal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an
acquired disease characterized by intravascu-
lar hemolysis that results from the clonal
expansion of PIG-A mutant hematopoietic
stem cells (HSCs) producing blood cells defi-
cient in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
proteins (GPI-AP), such as CD55 (decay accel-
erating factor, DAF) and CD59 (membrane
inhibitor of reactive lysis, MIRL). Such GPI-AP
deficient (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobin-
uria (PNH) - type) cells are often detectable in
the peripheral blood of patients with bone mar-
row failure syndromes including AA and RA as
defined by the FAB group.43-45 How PNH-type
cells arise and increase in patients with BM
failure remains obscure. PIG-A mutation itself
does not confer a proliferative advantage to
HSCs. The most widely accepted mechanism
for clonal expansion of PNH-type cells in
patients with BM failure is the “escape hypoth-
esis”, which states that the relative number of
PIG-A mutant HSCs increases by avoiding
immunological attacks by T cells or NK
cells.46,47 A murine study demonstrated that
GPI-AP-deficient hematopoietic cells can evade
a T-cell attack due to either the absence of the
target peptide recognized by GPI-AP specific T
cells, or the absence of accessory GPI-AP mole-
cules, which are required for HSCs to be
attacked by cytotoxic T cells.48 In MDS patients,
the expansion of PNH-type cells have been
reported in about 20% of the patients with
lower-risk MDS and that phenomenon has
been linked in some studies to IST responsive-
ness.43,44 The assay for PNH detection has not
been standardized across institutions in the
US and differs from that of Europe and Asia
making the association between presence of
PNH-type cells and response to IST difficult to
interpret.49 Standardization of the assay
around the world will likely improve the accu-
racy of this measure as a reliable biomarker of
disease.
Recently, Zou et al. analyzed the age-adjust-
ed CD4/CD8 ratio in 54 MDS patients com-
pared to 37 healthy controls which revealed
that inadequate CD4+ rather than expansion of
CD8+ T cells was associated with a lower ratio
in a group that included both lower and higher
risk MDS patients defined by the International
Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS).50 Inversion
of the CD4/CD8 ratio was strongly associated
with response to therapy (P<0.001). The loss
of CD4-cells was inversely correlated to the
proliferative T-cell index before treatment in
IST-responsive patients suggesting that prolif-
eration and accelerated CD4+ T-cell turnover
may be important in disease pathogenesis. In
many autoimmune diseases, there is a correla-
tion between the loss of CD4+ T cells and the
expansion of autoreactive CD8+ T cells.51 This
abnormality supersedes the simple loss of
CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) from the
peripheral or tissue compartment. Reduction
in CD4+ T cells may initiate a cytokine-depend-
ent pathway known as “homeostatic prolifera-
tion” in which the interleukin (IL)-2Rγ com-
mon cytokines such as IL-2, IL-7, IL-15 and/or
IL-21 non-specifically expand antigen-specific
and self-reactive T cells leading to an
increased risk for evasion of peripheral toler-
ance mechanisms leading to autoimmunity.52
Results by Zou et al. are the first to demon-
strate involvement of CD4+ T cells and
response to IST. Since the loss of CD4+ T cells
is strongly associated with impaired T-cell
homeostasis and accumulation of self-reactive
CD8+ T cells contributes to autoimmunity in
many models of human disease, this mecha-
nism may explain immune pathogenesis from
a global perspective. The highest homeostatic
proliferative index is afforded to T cells with
the highest affinity to self-antigens, explain-
ing not only trisomy 8 autoimmunity, but also
autoimmune pathogenesis in other settings. A
discovery of T-cell receptor (TCR) antigen
reactivity in patients with aggressive homeo-
static proliferation, without trisomy 8, is need-
ed. Kordasti et al. recently showed that the
numbers of CD3+ CD4+ IL-17 producing T cells
(Th17) were markedly increased and CD4+
CD25high FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs)
inversely decreased in lower risk MDS com-
pared with higher risk MDS.53 Tregs from MDS
patients suppressed IFN-γ secretion by effector

Figure 1. Molecular model of T-cell pathogenesis in MDS. Described in this review are the
supporting data that link T-cell abnormalities to multiple abnormal events that include
apoptotic response and the presence of inflammation in the bone marrow microenviron-
ment. The mechanism controlling the expansion of self-reactive CD8+ T-cells appears to
be two fold described by two models (DIRECT and INDIRECT); 1) there may be direct
activation of CD8+ T cells in response to abnormally expressed bone marrow antigens as
exemplified by patients with trisomy 8, and 2) there may be expansion of destructive CD8
T cells due to homeostatic cytokines of the IL-2Rβγcommon cytokines which include IL-
7, IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21. From previous results, lymphopenia-associated autoimmunity
has been linked to antigen-specific CD8+ T cells with variable self- antigen reactivity.
Survival advantage and clonal expansion dominates from CD8+ self-reactive T cells that
respond to antigen in the context of self-MHC class I bypassing peripheral tolerance
mechanisms. Results suggest that self-reactive CD8+ T-cells are involved in the suppres-
sion of bone marrow progenitors through direct cytotoxicity of the MDS clones such as
trisomy 8+ HPCs or the release of cytokines such as TNFα and IFNγ. There is also evi-
dence that depletion of CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and accumulation of IL-17-secret-
ing CD4+ T cells (Th17) may be imbalanced. Evidence supports the role of these T-cell
abnormalities in cytopenias and increased apoptosis observed in lower-risk MDS.

CD4+ T cells but had no effect on IL-17 produc-
tion. In addition, the serum levels of IL-7, IL-
12, RANTES and IFN-γ are significantly elevat-
ed in lower risk MDS, while inhibitory factors,
such as IL-10 and soluble IL-2 receptor, are sig-
nificantly higher in high-risk disease. They
concluded that the unfavorable Th17:Tregs
ratio in low-risk MDS may explain the higher
risk of autoimmunity and the improved
response to immune suppression in patients
with low-risk MDS compared to those with high-
risk disease.53 In general, more work should be
performed to determine the precise relationship
between CD4+ T cells, HLA DR15, and homeo-
static turnover as an alternative mechanism of
autoimmunity in MDS (Figure 1).
Therapy
Response criteria
In line with changes in the various classifi-
cation systems, therapeutic response stan-
dards have also evolved. In 2000, the
International Working Group (IWG) recom-
mended specific criteria for response that
defined four treatment goals including: (1)
treatment that alters the natural history of the
disease; (2) cytogenetic response; (3) hemato-
logic improvement (HI); and (4) quality of life
(QOL).54 The HI responses are particularly rel-
evant in patients treated with IST since
patients generally have lower risk disease, pos-
sess fewer bone marrow blasts, and suffer from
long-standing cytopenia. The IWG criteria for
HI define specific response to cytopenia in the
three hematopoietic lineages; erythroid (HI-
E), platelet (HI-P), and neutrophils (HI-N). In
2006, the IWG proposed modifications to the
response for altering natural history of MDS
and hematologic improvement. These are
summarized in Table 2.55
ATG based regimens
The goals of MDS therapy are to prolong sur-
vival, delay or prevent AML progression, and to
improve QOL. Although allogeneic hematopoi-
etic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the
only curative treatment in MDS, eligibility for
HSCT is limited due to the need for an HLA-
matched donor and the procedure-related co-
morbidities, which is particularly important in
this older patient population.56 With the suc-
cess of ATG in AA, there have been several
studies of not only ATG but other ATG-combi-
nation therapies in MDS.57-59
ATG is a mixture of purified polyclonal IgG
from the sera of rabbits (rATG, Thymoglobulin,
Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) or horses (eATG)
immunized with human thymocytes
(Lymphoglobulin, and Atgam) or the Jurkat
cell line (ATG Fresenius, Fresenius SE, Bad
Homburg, Germany).60 ATG has diverse effects
on the immune system including; (1) T-cell
depletion in blood and peripheral lymphoid tis-
sues through complement-dependent lysis and
apoptosis;61 (2) modulation of key cell surface
molecules that mediate leukocyte/epithelium
interactions;62 (3) induction of apoptosis in B-
cell lineages;63 (4) interference with dendritic
cell functional properties;64 (5) induction of
regulatory T65 and natural killer T cells,66 (6)
direct effect on hematopoietic progenitor cell
colony formation from primitive hematopoietic
cells;67 and (7) possibly, elimination of the Fas-
Fas-L interactions.68 Each product has shown
differential effects on the immune microenvi-
ronment and homeostasis. Table 3 summa-

rizes the results of clinical trials with ATG-
based regimens in MDS.
The first pilot study investigating ATG in
patients with MDS was conducted by investiga-
tors at the National Institute of Health (NIH)
in 199777 and the mature data (median follow-
up: 30 months) with a larger sample size was
reported in 2002.69 In this single-arm prospec-
tive study, 61 transfusion-dependent patients
with MDS (with <20% blasts) were treated
with one cycle of eATG (Atgam) at 40 mg/kg/d
for four days. The response criteria were as fol-
lows; (1) independence from transfusion for a
minimum of six weeks with a sustained
increase in hemoglobin, or (2) stable hemoglo-
bin within eight months of ATG treatment, as
measured from the time the patient last
received a transfusion until reinstitution of
RBC transfusions. Within eight months of
treatment, 21 of 61 patients (34%) no longer
required red blood cell transfusions.
Independence from transfusion was main-
tained in 17 of the 21 responders (81%) for a
median of 36 months (range 3-72 months).
Ten of 21 patients (47.5%) with severe throm-
bocytopenia had sustained increase in platelet
counts, and 6 of 11 patients (55%) with severe
neutropenia had sustained neutrophil counts
of greater than 1x109 cells/L. The clinical char-
acteristics associated with response included
younger age (Odds ratio, 0.45, P=0.005) and
lower platelet counts (median 68x109/L vs.
135x109/L, P=0.038).
Saunthararajah et al. reported that human
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR15 is overrepre-
sented and is predictive of response to IST in
the patients with MDS.70 It is well known that
HLA-DR15 is overrepresented in patients with
AA and PNH.78-80 Sloand et al. recently con-
firmed these findings in 129 MDS patients
who received equine antithymocyte globulin
(eATG, Atgam, Pfizer, New York, NY) with or
without cyclosporine (CsA, Novartis, Basel,
Switzerland) at the National Heart Lung Blood
Institute (NHLBI).76 Of 129 patients treated
with IST, 39 (30%) achieved a hematologic
response with a median follow-up of three
years (0.03-11.3 years). Factors associated
with response to IST were age and HLA-DR15
expression with the strongest linkage
observed in patients under 61 years of age.
Yazji et al. reported a durable response rate
of 23% with at least hematologic improve-
ment.76 In comparison to the initial NIH stud-
ies, a wider spectrum of MDS patients includ-
ing RA/RARS subtypes constituted 54% of the
cohort and only 35% had normal cytogenetics
(vs. 54% in studies by Molldrem et al.68,77)
Another study conducted by Steensma et al.
was terminated early due to a lack of clinical
efficacy.72 The early closure was restricted to a
small sample size of 8 subjects. No hematolog-
ic response was observed in any study subject.
Different factors might have contributed to
this disappointing result. This cohort shared
unfavorable characteristics: all with a Hbg
below 9 g/dL (in comparison to 10 g/dL in all
the other studies), older age (range 62-74
years), 6 of 8 patients had RAEB-1 and only 2
of 8 subjects had an RA subtype. Based on the
IPSS, 63% were Int-1 and 36% were Int-2. Four
patients had complex cytogenetics and only 2
had a normal karyotype. Hence, this cohort did
not represent the low-risk MDS population that
was predicted to respond to IST based on NIH
criteria. The small sample size (with 95% con-
fidence interval of 0-37%) could not statistical-
ly exclude the 35-45% hematologic response
reported in the literature.
In a non-randomized, single-arm trial by
Killick et al.,81 the efficacy of eATG (lym-
phoglobulin) was studied in a multi-institu-
tional trial. Valuable data with a median follow-
up of 34 months was reported in 2007.75 A total
of 96 patients from centers in the UK (n=65),
Germany (n=13), and Italy (n=18) were treat-
ed with one cycle of lymphoglobulin at
15mg/kg/d for five days. The International
Working Group (IWG) response criteria were
applied to evaluate response. In this study, a
total of 40 patients (42%) achieved a hemato-
logic response, of which 30 patients (75%) dis-
played a durable hematologic response lasting
a median duration of 31.5 months (range 6-92
months). In a multivariate analysis, both low
IPSS (P=0.018) and bone marrow hypocellular-
ity (P=0.012) were independent predictors of
response to ATG. In addition, IPSS was the sole
predictor of overall survival, with Int-2 and
high-risk patients having a significantly poor-

er survival outcome (P<0.01).
Stadler et al. compared the efficacy of eATG
(lymphoglobulin, 15 mg/kg/d for five days,
n=20) to rATG (thymoglobulin, 3.75 mg/kg/d
for five days, n=15), which is commonly used
for the treatment of AA. There was no signifi-
cant difference between the two ATG products
with regard to either the clinically relevant
responses or frequency of adverse effects.73
Broliden et al. reported the efficacy of ATG
and CsA therapy in MDS patients,74 since this
combination therapy is well known to be more
effective in the patients with AA.82 Twenty
patients (17 RA, 3 RAEB) received treatment
with rATG (ATG-Fresenius) plus CsA. The over-
all response rate was 30% (6/20); 3 of the 6
responders had a complete response. The
responses lasted 2-58 months, with 2 patients
still being in complete remission at 42 and 58
months, respectively.
CsA usage in MDS
Table 4 summarizes previous clinical trials
of CsA in MDS.83-89 CsA has a strong immuno-
suppressive effect mediated by inactivation of
the protein phosphatase calcineurin, resulting
in the inhibition of IL-2 gene activation.90
Inhibition of proliferative CTL expansion may
be critical for autoimmunity in MDS. The first
prospective trial with CsA was designed by
Janasova et al.83 Seventeen cytopenic patients
with MDS were treated and a durable response
was observed in 82%. Of note, 16 out of the 17
subjects had the RA subtype but varying
degrees of bone marrow cellularity. Most
patients had a normal karyotype or a single
cytogenetic abnormality of 5q-, which both
showed positive association with response in
this study although 5q- was not associated
with response to ATG in the recent NHLBI
study.76 The selection of cohorts with only
favorable profiles might contribute to the sur-
prisingly high response rate. Catalano et al.
treated 9 patients with RA and also demon-
strated a favorable response.84 In contrast,
another study reported by Atoyebi et al.85
showed no substantial response to CsA but an
unacceptable toxicity profile. An older median
age of the treatment group (70 years) may
have impacted the therapeutic response and
likely increased the risk of CsA-related nephro-
toxicity.
There have been several reports of
immunosuppression use from Asian coun-
tries. A large multicenter study of Japanese
MDS patients was reported by Shimamoto et
al.86 Fifty low-risk MDS patients were treated
with CsA (6 mg/kg/d) with variable marrow
cellularity. Of these patients, 30 patients
(60%) showed hematologic improvement.
Comparison of the clinical characteristics in
responders and non-responders demonstrated
that patients with a favorable karyotype, 0 or
0.5 IPSS score, and HLA-DRB1*1501 were
more responsive than patients with interme-
diate or poor risk karyotypes, 1.0 or 1.5 IPSS
score, and other HLA types, respectively. There
was no significant difference between
response to immunosuppressive therapy and
age, BM cellularity, BM blast percentage, or
dose and blood concentration of CsA.
Moreover, they found that bone marrow dys-
plastic features were present regardless of
hematologic response. This group demon-
strated a significant association between
hematologic improvement and an inverted
CD4/CD8 ratio and TCR-Vβ and –γ gene
rearrangements as biological predictors of
response.91 Although correlative studies were
carried out in only a few patients (n=4), these
results corroborate the findings by Zou et al.
using samples from patients at the NHLBI.50
Recently, Ishikawa et al. suggested the signif-
icance of the PNH clone in patients with low-
risk MDS in a prospective study.89 They treat-
ed 20 patients with MDS with CsA (4 mg/kg/d).
Among 19 patients evaluated, 10 showed
hematologic improvement, most of the toxici-
ty associated with CsA usage was manageable,
and no patient had progressed to AML at the
latest follow-up (median 30 months). A short
duration of illness, RA with minimal bone
marrow dysplasia, and the presence of the
PNH clone were all significantly associated
with a platelet response. A minority of RA
patients who did not possess such predictive
variables achieved an isolated erythroid
response.
Summary
MDS is the one of the most challenging
problems in hematology. Although the current
classification and prognostic schemes have
improved over the past decade, these patholog-
ical classification-based schemes are ineffec-
tive to distinguish pathological diversity and
therapeutic response. Importantly, substantial
clinical benefit is observed with IST treatment
in the US, Europe, and Asia. Response rates of
ATG therapy ranged from 20-40% and CsA
response ranged from 50-60% using IWG
response criteria. ATG therapy, however, has
not been used in Asia and few trials of CsA
therapy have been performed in Western coun-
tries creating an uncertainty about whether
there are specific pathobiological features of
the disease in Asia that predispose patients to
IST response or whether CsA therapy is supe-
rior to ATG therapy. For the most effective
application of IST, definitive mechanisms of
pathophysiology and biological predictors of
response must be established. A large clinical
trial that includes international centers and
compares ATG to CsA will clarify the features
associated with immune-mediated MDS. This
study should include not only clinical response
assessment but also correlative laboratory
analyses of variables shown previously to pre-
dict for hematologic improvement such as T-
cell clonality, T-cell homeostasis, HLA type,
microarray expression profiling, and PNH
analysis. To detect PNH-type cells, a sensitive
assay must be applied to detect small expan-
sions of these cells. In conclusion, the concept
of autoimmunity in MDS patients is widely
accepted but, clarification of the autoimmune
mechanism contributing to bone marrow
myelodysplasia and impaired hematopoiesis
must be obtained. In the future, the focus
should be on developing an international coor-
dinated clinical trial to define geographical
and therapeutic differences, newer approaches
to immune modulation, and basic studies to
understand the pathophysiological mecha-
nisms.
