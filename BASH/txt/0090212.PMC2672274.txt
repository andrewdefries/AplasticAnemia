Background: Acute dermatologic conditions are a concern for acute care practitioners. Comprising
1.4% of presenting complaints to emergency departments, most skin complaints are relatively benign;
however, some conditions can be quite severe. Prompt diagnosis is essential to avoid unnecessary
morbidity and mortality.
Objectives: To review drug-induced vasculitis.
Case Report: We present the case of a 43-year-old female with a chief complaint of bruising to her
ear, arm, and leg. She was found to have necrotizing vasculitis induced by propylthiouracil.
Conclusion: In this case, we look at the highlights of this presentation and review key aspects of
cutaneous vasculitis for the practicing emergency provider.

INTRODUCTION
Acute dermatologic conditions are a concern for all
healthcare professionals. With the increased national
utilization of acute care services, emergency physicians must
have a basic knowledge of such disorders. In 2004, “skin rash”
complaints accounted for 1.4% of all emergency department
(ED) visits.1
The majority of these conditions are benign and
non-emergent, with diagnoses ranging from contact dermatitis
to psoriasis. However, a small number of patients present with
acute dermatologic conditions requiring rapid diagnosis and
treatment.
Due to the multiple etiologies associated with
dermatologic emergencies, diagnosis may often be difficult.
However, one of the most common causes of dermatologic
presentations to acute care facilities is a drug reaction, and
it has been estimated that 10–20% of cutaneous reactions
to drugs are vasculitic reactions.2,3
The prognosis for drug-
induced vasculitis is usually improved with prompt removal
of the offending medication.4
We present a case in which
a 43-year-old woman with a history of Graves’ disease
presented to the ED after two weeks of progressive palpable
purpura caused by a propylthiouracil-induced vasculitis.
CASE REPORT
A 43-year-old woman presented to the ED with a chief
complaint of new-onset bruising. She had been well until two
weeks prior to admission, when she developed symptoms
consistent with an upper respiratory tract infection (URI).
At that time the patient developed a bruise on her left calf
without any history of trauma. As this started to resolve
she noted some bruising on the right ear four days later.
She complained that she was developing bruises along her
right tricep associated with increasing redness, swelling and
pain over these lesions. The patient denied any history of
domestic violence, liver disease, prior bruising episodes,
family history of bleeding disorders, heavy menses, or
anticoagulant use. Systemically the patient denied any fevers,
chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain,
hematuria or joint complaints. Her past medical history was
significant for Graves’ disease, which was being followed
by her endocrinologist. She also reported degenerative joint
disease of her left knee. Her medications included 50-mg
Western Journal of Emergency Medicine 213 Volume IX, no. 4 : November 2008
propylthiouracil (PTU) each day, which she has been taking
for the past nine years. She also reported the use of 400mg
Motrin as needed for pain relief from her arthritis. The
patient denied taking any other medications including over-
the-counter medications for her recent URI symptoms. The
patient stated that her mother had recently been diagnosed
with diabetes and thyroid disease but denied any other family
history. The patient reported a 20 pack/year tobacco history
but denied any illicit drug use.
On arrival to the ED she was afebrile at 36.4°C,
with a blood pressure of 116/78 mmHg, heart rate at 74
beats per minute, respirations at 14 breaths/minute with
oxygen saturation at 97% on room air. On examination,
she was a well-appearing woman in no acute distress. Her
skin examination showed several findings. She had trace
ecchymosis along the superior aspect of the helix of the
right ear (Figure 1). This area was otherwise non-tender
to palpation with no other abnormalities noted at the
ear. She had a second ecchymotic area at her right tricep
approximately 4 x 10 cm in diameter (Figure 2). The arm
was tender andindurated, with some erythema at the borders
of the lesion. There were no areas of fluctuance, and the
neurovascular function of the arm and hand were intact. She
also had one small left calf ecchymosis which was superficial
and non-tender, approximately 1.5cm in diameter (Figure 3).
Regarding the remainder of the examination, the patient’s eyes
were normal, pupils were equally round and reactive to light,
and no conjunctival injection was noted. The fundoscopic
examination was unremarkable bilaterally. Lungs were clear to
auscultation without increase in respiratory effort. The cardiac
exam showed regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub,
or gallop. The abdominal examination was non-tender with
no evidence of rebound or guarding. The rectal examination
was normal with guiac-negative brown stool. The neurologic
examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory analyses of CBC, coagulation studies,
electrolytes, urinalysis, liver function tests, and negative urine
pregnancy test were unremarkable. Blood cultures were sent
and eventually returned negative. Erythrocyte sedimentation
rate was elevated at 54. The patient was admitted to the
hospital for further, assessment and subsequent lab studies
were as follows with normal ranges in parentheses. Thyroid
function tests showed a TSH of 1.40 uIU/mL, a free T4 of
0.74 ng/dL (0.85-1.69), and a free T3 of 4.23 pg/mL (2.0-4.1).
Antiphospholipid panel was negative. Anti-nuclear antibody
screen was negative. Perinuclear-staining anti-neutrophil
cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA) was positive. Antithrombin
III was 104% (80-120), D-dimer was 1303ng/mL (<250), and
fibrinogen was 345 mg/dL (240-490).
The clinical presentation of a palpable, purpuric rash
in conjunction with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation
rate and ANCA titers indicated a vasculitis. In general,
the differential diagnosis for vasculitis includes infectious
etiologies (22.1%), autoimmune disorders (4.4%), connective
tissue disease (11.4%), malignancy (4.3%), environmental
exposures including medications (22.7%) or idiopathic
(39% frequency).5
In our patient, the lack of associated
clinical symptoms and absence of other possible etiologic

sources lead us to believe the ANCA-positive vasculitis was
secondary to her PTU. Previous data suggests that vasculitic
complications associated with PTU administration have
a varied time of onset and have been reported anywhere
from three days to seven years from the time of initiation
of therapy.6
Furthermore, despite conservative management
with 60 mg prednisone per day, the patient’s symptoms did
not resolve until several days after admission when the PTU
therapy was discontinued. The decision to continue her PTU
while awaiting the diagnostic workup, rather than immediately
discontinue the medication, was made due to her lack of other
end-organ failure often associated with vasculitis. With the
vasculitis resolving, the patient was treated with a total course
of oral prednisone, 60 mg each day for 10 days, along with
metoprolol, 100mg each day for her Graves’ disease, and
she was discharged from the hospital. The possibility of re-
challenging the patient on PTU was subsequently considered
after her symptoms had resolved, but given the data (albeit
limited) which suggests a high recurrence of vasculitis, it was
felt that other treatment options should be pursued.6
The patient returned for subtotal thyroidectomy to address
her Graves’ disease. The surgery was uneventful, and she
was discharged with supplementation for hypothyroidism,
hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.
DISCUSSION
Vasculitis is a rare condition among the general
population with one study showing an estimated lifetime
incidence of biopsy-proven vasculitis at 39.6 per million;
however, the number varies based on geography, tertiary vs.
outpatient setting.7
The true incidence may be higher due to
the under-diagnosis of mild or subclinical presentations. The
etiology of vasculitic disease can be attributed to a primary
idiopathic process or to a secondary autoimmune syndrome,
infectious agent, trauma, or medication. In attempting
to determine an etiology, a proper history is essential. In
general, drug-induced vasculitis is more likely to have
cutaneous manifestation compared to idiopathic vasculitis.8
And it is more likely to manifest with pulmonary and renal
complications than musculoskeletal complaints.9
Drug-induced vasculitis has been reported from
penicillins, sulfonamides, allopurinol, antithyroid drugs,
and multiple other compounds.10
Of the thyroid drugs
propylthiouracil is the most often reported as causing drug-
induced vasculitis. Ithas also been associated with other
rheumatic manifestations, including serum sickness and
PTU-induced lupus.9
There is some debate whether PTU is
the primary cause of rheumatologic disease or if the increased
incidence is due to the underlying thyroid disease of the
patients, which has been shown to predispose patients to other
autoimmune conditions. PTU has been associated with various
other inflammatory conditions, such as agranulocytosis,
aplastic anemia, hepatitis, interstitial pneumonitis, and others.
The mechanism of PTU-induced vasculitis is not clear.
Studies have shown that PTU can accumulate in neutrophils.
This may allow PTU to bind to myeloperoxidase (MPO),
which when oxidized can inactivate this enzyme. This
inactivation with the continued presence of PTU can induce
the formation of auto-antibodies, thereby stimulating other
neutrophils to degranulate, causing vascular damage.4,6,10,11,12
Clinically the development of the MPO-ANCA antibodies
are more prevalent in the serum of patients treated with PTU,
and studies have demonstrated that MPO-ANCA positivity
was increased after being treated by PTU as compared to
other hyperthyroid medications.9,11,13
It should be noted,
however, that not all patients with these antibodies developed
clinical symptoms of PTU-induced rheumatic disease, which
contraindicates the use of these auto-antibodies as a screening
tool.14
There are currently 44 cases of PTU-induced vasculitis
in the literature since 2002, with an apparent female and
Japanese-ethnic predominance.6
This gender predominance is
likely attributed to the higher incidence of thyroid disease in
women. It is unknown why Japanese ethnicity, which accounts
for half of all reported cases, predisposes patients.11
There may
be a genetic predisposition to the formation of auto-antibodies,
or it may be caused by variations in treatment regimens. The
age of onset varies but appears to have a higher incidence
in younger patients; however, the reported age range is 13-
80 years old.6,14
Of note, the development of PTU-induced
vasculitis is hypothesized to be independent of the dosage of
PTU prescribed or the duration of PTU treatment, based on
the limited data available.6
The clinical presentation can be varied and complex due
to systemic complications and multi-organ involvement of
small-vessel disease. Signs of PTU-induced vasculitis include
anemia (seen in the majority of patients), skin lesions (ulcers,
purpura, subcutaneous nodules, and erythema nodosum-like
and erythema multiforme-like lesions), arthralgia, fever,
malaise, lymphadenopathy, hematuria/proteinuria, alveolar
hemorrhage, and pleural effusion.4,6,14
Multiple organ systems
can be affected, including renal failure, cholestatic jaundice,
cardiac dysfunction, pleural effusions, pneumonitis/pleuritis,
and hearing loss. The most common laboratory abnormalities
include neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated
transaminases10
(although our patient demonstrated none
of these). Histologically the majority of patients developed
crescentic glomerulonephritis or other forms of renal
changes.4,14
Clinical diagnosis is often difficult because of the
overlapping presentations of the various vasculitic diseases.
Although biopsy is diagnostic, in most cases the diagnosis
of drug-induced vasculitis is made by exclusion or with
resolution of symptoms after withdrawal of medications.
Once PTU-induced vasculitis is determined, the simple
withdrawal of PTU usually causes resolution of the

symptoms after 1-4 weeks.3
Some patients have been reported
to have continued laboratory abnormalities (elevated serum
creatinine, proteinuria, positive ANCA titers) throughout their
clinical follow-up without evidence of clinical symptoms.3
Patients with more severe presentations are typically treated
with steroids. When considering treatment for Gravesí
disease after resolution of their symptoms, re-administration
of PTU is not recommended because it often causes a repeat
reaction;6,10,11
however, there does not appear to be cross-
reactivity between agents.2,10
Therefore, consideration of
treatment should be a multi-disciplinary approach to weigh
the risk and benefits of further medical treatment versus
surgical intervention.
CONCLUSION
Drug-induced vasculitis should be considered in any
patient who takes medications and develops cutaneous
eruptions. Emergency practitioners should be able to
differentiate benign skin conditions from those that are
potentially progressive, causing morbidity and possibly
mortality.
