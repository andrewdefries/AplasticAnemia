Abstract
Patients undergoing HCT are at increased risk of chronic health conditions, including second
malignant neoplasms and cardiovascular disease. Little is known about health behaviors and
cancer screening practices among HCT survivors that could moderate the risk of these conditions.
The BMTSS examined health behaviors and cancer screening practices in individuals who
underwent HCT between 1976 and 1998, and survived 2+ years. Health behavior was deemed
high-risk if an individual was a current smoker and if they reported risky alcohol intake (≥4
drinks/day [males], ≥ 3 drinks/day [females]) on days of alcohol consumption. Cancer screening
assessment was per American Cancer Society recommendations. There were 1040 survivors:
42.7% underwent allogeneic HCT; 43.8% were female; median time from HCT: 7.4 years (range
2.0–27.7 years). Median age at study participation: 43.8 years (range 18.3–73.0 years).
Multivariate regression analysis revealed younger age (<35 years) at study participation (Odds
Ratio [OR]=4.7; p<0.01) and lower education (<college: OR=2.1; p<0.01) to be significantly
associated with high-risk behavior. Survivors were significantly less likely to report high-risk
behavior (OR=0.5; p<0.01), and more likely to have had a screening mammogram (OR=2.8;
p=0.05) when compared to gender-matched sibling controls (N=309).
INTRODUCTION
Improvements in transplantation strategies have contributed to increments in survival
approximating 10% per decade, and long-term survival is an expected outcome for many
who undergo HCT.1–3 Patients who survive for 2 years after allogeneic HCT now have
survival rates that exceed 80% at 15 years,4,5 and the survival rates approach 70% at 10
years following autologous HCT.6 The growing population of long-term survivors has
brought to the medical forefront a host of chronic and debilitating conditions attributed to
toxicity from pre-transplantation exposure, transplantation conditioning regimens, chronic
immunosuppression and graft versus host disease (GvHD).2,3,7,8 The cumulative incidence

of any chronic health condition in these long-term survivors approaches 60% at 10 years,
and the incidence is 35% for severe or life-threatening conditions or death from such
conditions.9
Appropriate, timely, and risk-based preventive care for these survivors may help attenuate
late effects of therapy via preventive strategies that encourage healthy lifestyle behaviors,
specialized surveillance and screening, and health risk management, which may ultimately
lead to improved quality of life. On the other hand, high risk health behaviors may
negatively impact quality of life in long-term survivors, and there are well-described
associations between smoking, excessive alcohol intake, and diminished physical activity
and various adverse health-related outcomes in cancer survivors.10–13 There is a paucity of
data regarding health-behaviors and cancer screening practices in long-term HCT survivors.
An estimate of the populations at risk for unhealthy life-style practices, and for non-
adherence to current recommendations for cancer screening would inform development of
targeted interventions. The current study describes health risk behaviors and cancer
screening practices of long-term survivors of HCT, and a healthy comparison group, and
identifies sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with increased risk for health risk
behaviors and non-adherence to cancer screening recommendations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
BMTSS is a collaborative effort between City of Hope (COH) and University of Minnesota
(UMN) to examine the long-term outcomes of individuals who have survived two or more
years after HCT. Eligible participants include individuals who received HCT at COH or
UMN between 1974 and 1998 for a hematologic malignancy or severe aplastic anemia
(SAA); survived at least two years post-transplantation; and were alive and 18 years of age
or older at study participation. The Human Subjects Protection committees at the
participating institutions approved the study. Informed consent was obtained according to
the Declaration of Helsinki.
Of the 1680 survivors who were alive at study participation, 1506 (90%) were successfully
contacted, and 1040 (69%) participated. Compared to non-participants, study participants
were older at HCT (median age: 34.3 versus 31.1 years, p<0.01), had a shorter period of
follow-up after HCT (median: 7.4 versus 9.2 years, p<0.01), were less likely to be female
(37% versus 44%, p=0.01), and non-Hispanic white (69% versus 77%, p<0.01).
Participation rate did not differ by type of transplant (autologous, allogeneic), diagnosis,
institution, or risk of relapse at HCT. Comparison with a non-cancer population was made
possible by asking participating survivors to invite a nearest-age sibling to the study. A total
of 309 siblings participated in this study.
A 255-item mailed questionnaire was used to collect information from all participants alive
at the time of study enrollment, and covered the following general areas: sociodemographics
(race/ethnicity, marital status, education, employment, annual household income, and health
insurance); utilization of medical care over the past two years; presence of chronic GvHD;
concerns regarding their future health, and diagnosis of physical health conditions
(endocrinopathies; central nervous system compromise; cardiopulmonary dysfunction;
gastrointestinal and hepatic sequelae; musculoskeletal abnormalities; and subsequent
malignancies). Health conditions were graded using CTCAE v 3.0 (grade 1–4, ranging from
mild to life-threatening/disabling).9 The reliability and validity of the BMTSS questionnaire
has been tested, and the results indicate moderate to high agreement between self-reported
outcomes and medical records.14

Information regarding primary diagnosis, preparative regimens, source of stem cells
(autologous or allogeneic), and risk of relapse at HCT (standard vs. high risk), was obtained
from institutional transplantation databases. Patients transplanted in first or second complete
remission after acute leukemia (acute myeloid [AML] or lymphoid [ALL]) leukemia),
lymphoma (Hodgkin lymphoma [HL] or non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL]), in first chronic
phase of chronic myeloid leukemia [CML], and all patients with SAA were considered
being at standard risk for relapse; all others were considered at high-risk.
Health Behaviors
Smoking—Current smokers were defined as those who reported having smoked at least
100 cigarettes in their lifetime and currently smoked on a regular basis. Former smokers
were defined as individuals who reported having smoked at least 100 or more cigarettes in
their lifetime but did not currently smoke. Never-smokers included those who did not smoke
more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.
Alcohol intake—Risky alcohol intake was defined as that which exceeded the National
Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines.15,16 These guidelines
include limits on both daily and weekly alcohol intake and define risky drinking for women
to exceed three drinks per day or seven drinks per week, and for men more than four drinks
per day or 14 drinks per week.
High Risk Behavior—Survivors were considered to be engaging in High Risk Behavior if
they reported current smoking and risky alcohol intake.
Cancer Screening Practices
Cancer screening practices were assessed according to recommendations for the general
population at the time this survey was conducted, including those of the U.S. Preventive
Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Cancer Society (ACS).17–20 The
guidelines for the general population were chosen because at the time of questionnaire
administration, there was no consensus concerning guidelines for cancer screening in
conventionally treated21 or HCT22 survivors.
Female participants—For females, breast cancer screening practices were assessed by
asking about frequency of self-breast examination as well as recency of clinical breast
examination. Self-breast examination was considered to be regular, if a survivor reported at
least monthly self-examination. Clinical breast exam was considered recent if it was
performed by a physician or health care professional within the past 2 years. Cervical cancer
screening was considered to be recent if an individual had a papanicolaou (pap) smear
within the past 2 years. In addition, all female participants were asked if they ever had a
mammogram.
Male participants—Males were asked about frequency of testicular self examination
(TSE); regular testicular cancer screening was defined as TSE of at least once a month.
Statistical Analyses
Survivors and siblings were compared with regards to demographics, socioeconomic
variables, healthcare utilization, and concerns regarding their future health using standard
parametric and non-standard parametric tests. Prevalence of health behaviors and cancer
screening was determined for survivors and siblings. Health behaviors were dichotomized as
follows: smoking (current smoker vs. former or never smoked), risky alcohol intake
(Females: >3 drinks/day or >7 drinks/week or Males: >4 drinks/day or >14 drinks/week vs.

less frequently), high risk behavior (current smoker and risky alcohol intake vs. none).
Cancer screening practices were dichotomized as follows: females – self-breast examination
(once a month vs. less frequently), clinical breast examination (within the past 2 years vs. >2
years ago), mammogram (at least once vs. none); males – TSE (once a month vs. less
frequently). Analyses pertaining to mammography were limited to females ≥ 40 years of age
at the time questionnaire per general population recommendations.18,19 Subset analyses
were performed using an earlier age cutoff (≥30 years) to compare mammography practices
in females treated with mediastinal radiation versus no radiation or siblings sibling controls.
Age 30 was selected because at the time of questionnaire administration, it represented a
conservative estimate of age at which many authorities agreed mammography should be
performed regularly for survivors treated with mediastinal radiation.23,24
HCT survivors vs. sibling controls—Multivariate logistic regression analyses were
performed to compare cancer screening practices and health risk behaviors of HCT
survivors vs. siblings, after adjusting for potential confounding variables. Independent
variables included age at questionnaire, ethnicity, education, household income, marital
status, health insurance, level of concern regarding their future health, and gender (limited to
health behavior analyses). The results were reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). Data were analyzed using SAS 9.1 (SAS institute, Cary, NC). All
statistical tests were two-sided.
HCT survivors—Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors
of cancer screening and health risk behaviors among HCT survivors. The dependent
variables for the regression models included: regular breast examination (females), recent
clinical breast examination (females), previous mammogram (limited to females ≥ 40 years
of age at questionnaire), recent pap smear (females), regular TSE (males), current smoking,
risky alcohol intake, and high-risk behavior; independent variables included age at
questionnaire, gender (limited to health behavior analysis), ethnicity, marital status,
household income, health insurance, education, age at HCT, type of HCT, conditioning
regimen, severity of reported chronic health condition, follow-up at Cancer/HCT center, and
level of concern regarding their future health.
RESULTS
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of HCT Survivors and Siblings
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study participants (HCT survivors,
n=1040; siblings, n=309) are presented in Table 1. Compared to siblings, HCT survivors
were younger at study participation (median age, 43.8 years versus 45.2 years, p=0.03), less
likely to be female (43.8% versus 63.4%, p<0.01), or non-Hispanic white (77.0% versus
87.4%, p<0.01), less likely to be college graduates (43.5% versus 56.3%, p<0.01), less likely
to be married (65.5% versus 78.3%, p<0.01), or insured (90.2% versus 94.2%, p=0.03).
AML (24.5%), CML (23.9%), NHL (20.0%), and ALL (10.2%) accounted for 78.6% of all
primary diagnoses. Total body irradiation (TBI) was used for 78.4%, and 35% of the
survivors were at high-risk for relapse at HCT. Fifty-seven percent of the HCT survivors had
received an allogeneic HCT; of them, approximately 54% developed chronic GvHD after
HCT. The cohort had been followed for a median of 7.4 years from HCT.
Risky Health Behaviors and Cancer Screening Practices of HCT Survivors and Siblings
Compared to siblings, survivors were significantly more likely to be concerned about their
future health (very/somewhat concerned: 51.9% versus 39.7%, p<0.01); the proportion of
those concerned about the likelihood of developing cancer was equivalent among survivors
(41.9%) and siblings (37.9%; p=0.13). Table 2 summarizes the prevalence of health

behaviors and cancer screening practices of survivors and sibling controls. Despite reporting
similar rates of having ever smoked >100 cigarettes (40.6% survivors versus 44.7%,
p=0.20), survivors were significantly less likely to report current smoking (7.0%) when
compared to siblings (12.9%, p<0.01). Of the 73 survivors who reported current smoking,
58 (79.5%) had started smoking prior to HCT, while 15 (20.5%) initiated smoking following
HCT. Median rate of smoking was 10 cigarettes per day (range: 1–50), and 53.4% reported
attempting to quit in the previous 2 years. Of the 349 survivors who were former smokers,
291 (83.4%) quit prior to undergoing HCT, while 58 (16.6%) quit following HCT. There
were no differences in demographics, socioeconomic status, or treatment-related variables
between survivors who quit following HCT versus those who continued to smoke after
HCT. However, survivors who initiated smoking after HCT were significantly younger at
HCT (mean age: 12.5 years versus 27.4 years, p<0.01), and tended to have a longer follow-
up period (mean time from HCT: 15.0 years versus 12.3 years, p=0.10), and were less likely
to have regular cancer/HCT-related visits (60.0% vs. 77.2%, p=0.13) when compared to
survivors who quit after HCT.
Compared to siblings, HCT survivors were less likely to report risky alcohol intake (9.5%
versus 13.3%, p=0.06); overall, survivors were significantly less likely to report high risk
behavior (current smoking and risky alcohol intake [8.5% versus 14.6%, p<0.01]) compared
to siblings.
There were no differences in cervical or testicular cancer screening practices between
survivors and siblings (table 2). Thirty-two out of 456 (7.0%) female HCT survivors had
received chest or mantle radiation as part of their pre-HCT treatment. As seen in figure 1,
siblings and survivors reported equally high rates of self- or clinical breast examination or
mammography, regardless of radiation exposure. Using a younger age cutoff of ≥ 30 years
at the time of questionnaire, we found that survivors previously treated with chest or mantle
radiation were significantly more likely to report ever having had a mammogram (95.8%)
when compared to survivors not treated with radiation (85.0%) or siblings (76.2%, p=0.01).
The prevalence of mammographic screening in the younger cohort (age 25–39 years) was
80.0% for survivors treated with chest radiation, and 58.4% and 25.0% for survivors with no
radiation and siblings, respectively (p<0.01) Multivariate logistic regression revealed that
survivors were significantly less likely to report current smoking (odds ratio [OR] = 0.4,
p<0.01), risky alcohol intake (OR=0.5, p<0.01), or high risk behavior (OR=0.5, p<0.01)
when compared to sibling controls (Table 3). Female survivors were nearly three-times as
likely to report ever having had a mammogram (OR=2.8, p=0.05) when compared to
siblings.
Risky Health Behaviors and Cancer Screening Practices among HCT survivors
Table 4 summarizes the results of multivariate regression analysis restricted to HCT
survivors, examining the relevant demographic, clinical, and treatment-related factors
associated with self-reported risky health behavior. Younger participants (<35 years) were
5.6-fold more likely to report risky alcohol intake (p<0.01) and nearly 5-fold more likely to
report high risk behavior (p<0.01). Having less than college education was associated with a
3.1-fold risk of current smoking (p<0.01), and a 2.1-fold likelihood of risky alcohol intake
(OR=2.1, p<0.01) or high risk behavior (OR=2.1, p<0.01). Lack of health insurance was
associated with a 2.4-fold risk of current smoking (p=0.02) There were no predictors of
cancer screening practices identified among HCT survivors (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
The overall goals of the current study were to determine the prevalence of cancer screening
practices and risky health behaviors in HCT survivors in comparison to a healthy sibling

group, and identify populations with poor adherence to screening and health promotion
recommendations.15,17–20 We found that compared to siblings, survivors were less likely to
report risky health behaviors such as smoking or excessive alcohol intake, and had similar or
better cancer screening practices. However, despite the potential for long-term sequelae,
younger survivors, those without health insurance, and with lower education continued to
engage in high risk behaviors, thus informing education and targeted interventions in the
future.
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends that all cancer survivors have regular medical
care that is adapted to specific risks due to their previous cancer therapy, lifestyle, or any
comorbid health conditions.25 Investigators from the Childhood Cancer Survivors Study
(CCSS) have found that despite having similar cancer screening rates as the general
population, the frequency and extent of these screenings remains suboptimal for many adult
survivors of childhood cancer.10,26,27 On the other hand, studies in survivors of adult onset
cancer have reported better than expected cancer screening practices in survivors when
compared to age-matched controls.28,29 To date, few studies have examined the cancer
screening practices of long-term HCT survivors, a population at risk for developing chronic
health conditions, including subsequent malignant neoplasms.9
We found that the vast majority of female survivors reported having had a recent clinical
breast examination (88%) or pap smear (85%), and this was better than or comparable to
U.S. population-based data from the time of questionnaire administration (breast
examination, 60–76%; pap smear, 85–87%) 30,31. The reported low rates of regular BSE
(survivors, 29%; siblings, 27%) or TSE (survivors, 18%; siblings 20%) in the current study
were similar to those reported in adult survivors of childhood cancer (27% for regular BSE,
17% regular TSE),27 and may reflect ongoing controversies regarding the utility and yield of
such screenings.32–35 After adjusting for sociodemographics and level of concern regarding
future health, female HCT survivors were nearly three times as likely to report having had at
least one mammogram compared to sibling controls. There were no differences in cervical
cancer or testicular cancer screening practices between the two groups.
It is now well-recognized that female cancer survivors previously treated with chest or
mantle radiation are at increased risk of developing breast cancer years following
completion of therapy;26 as a result it is recommended that these women undergo screening
at a younger age than general population..21,22,26 In the current study, nearly all women
(96%) treated with chest radiation who were 30 years of age or older at the time of
questionnaire reported having had at least one screening mammogram, and all had a recent
clinical breast examination. As expected, the difference in screening rates between radiation-
treated, non-radiation treated, and sibling participants was greatest for the 30–39 year old
age group. While none of the consensus guidelines were available at the time of
questionnaire administration, it is encouraging that a sizeable number of survivors treated
with radiation had undergone regular breast cancer screening, a finding that is likely to
continue to improve with increased awareness and greater dissemination of survivorship
screening guidelines.
Guidelines of the USPSTF recommend that healthcare providers screen all adults for
tobacco use and other high risk behavior, and that cessation interventions be provided for
those engaged in such behavior.36 Adverse health related outcomes attributed to excess
alcohol or tobacco use have been well-described in the non-oncology community, and there
is a growing body of literature describing their modifying effect on adverse outcomes in
long-term cancer survivors.10 For patients engaging in high risk behaviors, a diagnosis of
cancer or HCT may serve as a catalyst for life change. However, studies have found that
most survivors report relatively few changes in their overall health behaviors, and that the

lifestyle practices largely remain unchanged in the long-term by the cancer experience.13,37
In the current study, despite having a similar past smoking history, survivors were
significantly less likely to report current smoking, and had a higher quit rate when compared
to sibling controls. Overall, after adjusting for baseline demographic differences, HCT
survivors were 50% less likely to report high risk behavior when compared to sibling
controls.
Despite the encouraging health practices of HCT survivors, there were a sizeable number of
survivors who continued to engage in risky health behaviors long after undergoing HCT.
Consistent with previous research,10,38 we found that younger age, lack of health insurance,
and lower education were significant predictors of adverse health behavior. The reasons why
cancer survivors chose to engage in these behaviors are not known, but a perception of
invulnerability or denial have been proposed as possible factors.39 Survivors who initiated
smoking after HCT were younger at HCT, had a longer period of follow-up post-HCT and
were less likely to report regular cancer/HCT-related visits when compared to those who
quit smoking after HCT, suggesting that the level of engagement in health-related issues
may be an important modifier of risk for adverse health behaviors in this population. This
highlights the importance of ongoing multi-disciplinary long term follow-up care that places
equal emphasis on primary as well as secondary disease prevention.
The results of this study must be interpreted in the context of potential limitations.
Approximately one third of the eligible patients did not participate in the current study.
Although participants and non-participants were similar in many respects, it is possible that
those who participated were more likely to be engaged in health screenings, less likely to
have high risk behaviors. If this were to be true, the prevalence rates presented here are more
conservative than what would be expected with complete participation. In addition, similar
to previous studies, 13,28,29,38,39 information regarding cancer screening and health risk
behaviors were ascertained using self-report, potentially contributing to an overestimation of
cancer screening practices and underestimation of adverse health behaviors in both survivors
and siblings. However, the reported cancer screening rates for siblings were similar to those
in the general population at the time of survey, suggesting that despite these limitations,
information presented in the current study adequately represented the health behaviors of
long-term survivors of HCT.
In summary, HCT survivors had comparable cervical and testicular cancer screening
practices, were more likely to have had breast cancer screening by mammography, and were
less likely to be engaged in high risk behaviors when compared to healthy sibling controls.
We found that despite potential long-term risks, certain subsets of survivors continue to
engage in high-risk behaviors such as smoking and excessive alcohol intake, indicating the
need for targeted interventions for these high risk populations. Continued vigilance in
encouraging appropriate cancer screening and healthy behaviors for HCT survivors will be
critical to building on the positive behavioral outcomes described in the current study.
