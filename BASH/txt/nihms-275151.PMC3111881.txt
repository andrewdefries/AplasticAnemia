Abstract
Background—Late complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
include a risk of secondary malignancies, including oral cancers. Optimization of best clinical
practices for early diagnosis and treatment of oral premalignant or malignant lesions requires an
assessment of potential predisposing risk factors as well as treatment outcomes.
Methods—The medical records of patients who developed oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) and
oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) following allogeneic HSCT were reviewed. Data on
demographics, HSCT course, chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), smoking and alcohol
consumption, oral lesion characteristics, mode of therapy and clinical outcome were recorded;
landmark survival was calculated.
Results—Twenty-six patients with OED (n = 8) and OSCC (n = 18) were identified with a
median follow-up of 26.5 and 21.5 months, respectively. Premalignant and malignant oral lesions
were diagnosed at a median time of 2.5 and 8 years after HSCT, respectively. Chronic GVHD was
present in 96% of patients and of these, 96% had oral involvement. Multifocal oral cancer was
found in 28% of cases, and localized recurrence was observed in 44% of cases. Five-year overall
survival was 75% and 70% for OED and OSCC, respectively.

Conclusions—These results suggest that oral cGVHD may be considered a potential risk factor
for the development of OSCC following allogeneic HSCT. The observation that oral cancers were
frequently multifocal and recurred locally supports the concept of field cancerization and suggests
that these cancers may be more aggressive compared with the non-HSCT population. Vigilant
follow-up and coordination of care between hematologists and oral health specialists are critical to
minimize morbidity and mortality.
Introduction
With improved outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT),
increasing attention has been drawn to late complications in long-term survivors. Among
these, survivors of allogeneic HSCT are at significantly increased risk for developing second
cancers with the incidence of secondary solid tumors 2-6% at 10 years, and 6-13% at 15
years. (1-3)
Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and mouth are the most common second solid
malignancies, accounting for one-third of all secondary solid tumors, with oral squamous
cell carcinoma (OSCC) representing 50% of these cases. (1,2,4) Curtis et al analyzed over
19,000 patients from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry and the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in the largest study of second cancers following
allogeneic HSCT; the relative risk of OSCC was significantly increased in male patients
(9.7), patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD; 6.0) and patients who
received total body radiation as part of their conditioning regimen (3.0) as well as with time
after HSCT (>10 years; relative risk 77.9). (1) Moreover, several case reports and small case
series of OSCC following allogeneic HSCT have been reported. (2,5-13) Possible
mechanisms that have been proposed include radiation mutagenesis, cGVHD-related
inflammation, prolonged immunosuppression from cGVHD therapy, immunological
dysfunction, and carcinogenic and cytotoxic effects of immunosuppressive therapy, or a
combination thereof. (8,14,15)
An improved understanding of the clinical features and potential factors associated with
secondary OSCC, as well as its course and treatment outcomes, may be beneficial in better
predicting, identifying and managing this very serious late toxicity of allogeneic HSCT. The
objective of this study was to comprehensively review a multi-center cohort of patients who
developed oral malignant lesions or oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) lesions after allogeneic
HSCT.
Material and Methods
A retrospective review of clinical records was conducted for patients who had undergone
allogeneic HSCT and were subsequently diagnosed with oral malignant or premalignant
mucosal lesions. Non-epithelial cancers, such as post-transplantation lymphoproliferative
disease, or relapsed hematologic malignancy with oral manifestations were excluded. Cases
were collected from three transplantation centers: 1) Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's
Cancer Center, Boston, USA; 2) Hadassah University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel; and
3) Bone Marrow Transplant Center, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil. This
study was approved by each center's institutional review board. All patients were
transplanted between May 1980 and November 2007 and diagnosed with OED and OSCC
lesions between May 1995 and March 2010.
Clinical data included HSCT course, cGVHD history, and details of OED and OSCC
lesions, including presentation, staging (for carcinomas), management, and treatment
outcomes. Tobacco and alcohol histories were obtained because these are well established

risk factors in the non-HSCT general population. Oral lesions were classified into two
categories: 1) OED, including verrucous hyperplasia (VH) and conventional dysplasia; and
2) malignant lesions (invasive carcinoma) including OSCC and verrucous carcinoma (VC,
considered a histopathologic variant of squamous cell carcinoma).
Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of diagnosis of secondary oral changes
or malignant oral disease to the date of death, censored at the date of last contact. Freedom
from recurrence (FFR) was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis of malignant oral
disease until the date of recurrence for patients with malignant oral disease, censored at the
date of last contact. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
Twenty-six patients with a median age of 49 (range 14-67) were diagnosed with oral OED
or OSCC after allogeneic HSCT (Tables 1 and 2) with a median follow-up of 26.5 and 21.5
months, respectively. Three patients (12%) developed VH, 5 patients (19%) developed
dysplasia and 18 patients (69%) developed invasive carcinoma. Twenty-four patients (96%)
had cGVHD, and of these patients, 96% (23/24) presented with prominent oral features,
requiring a variety of systemic and topical immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory
therapies (Table 3). The median time from the first allogeneic transplantation to diagnosis of
OED was 3 years for VH (range 1-13) and 2 years for dysplasia (range 1-3 years), whereas
the median time to diagnosis of OSCC was 8 years (range 1-14 years; Table 4). Smoking
and alcohol consumption was common in this cohort: 42% smoked or previously smoked
and 35% regularly consumed alcohol (Table 5).
OED was most commonly observed on the lower lip, as a solitary lesion (Table 4). The
median lesion dimensions at diagnosis were 2.0 × 1.0 cm and 1.0 × 1.0 cm for VH and
dysplasia, respectively. All OED presented as leukoplakia (verrucous or otherwise),
erythroleukoplakia, or proliferative verrucuous leukoplakia (Figure 1).(16) One case of
dysplasia was associated with pain; all other cases of OED were asymptomatic. All
premalignant lesions were treated surgically; one was treated with surgery followed by
topical 5-fluorouracil (Figure 2).
Invasive carcinomas were predominately OSCC (n=15; 88%) with only 2 cases of VC
observed (Figure 3 and 4; Table 5). Three cases of OSCC were preceded by a
histopathological diagnosis of dysplasia (3/16, 19%; median time from dysplasia to OSCC
29 months, data not shown). The majority of invasive carcinomas (72%) were diagnosed as
either Stage I or Stage II. The tongue was the most common site (n=10; 56%), followed by
buccal mucosa (n=7; 39%) and lower lip (n=3; 17%); 28% presented with multifocal
disease. Half of cases were purely white (50%), followed by red and white (44%) and purely
red lesions (6%), and the median lesion size was 2.0 × 1.5 cm. The most frequent clinical
features at diagnosis were plaques (50%), exophytic masses (39%) and ulcers (28%). Eleven
cases (61%) presented with pain and two (11%) with paresthesia/anesthesia.
All but one case was managed with surgery with or without adjuvant radiation and/or
chemoradiation therapy (Table 4). Eight cases (47%) had neck dissection as a part of the
surgical management and only one patient had metastasis which involved the regional
lymph nodes. Radiation therapy was not administered in 12 cases, including two Stage III
cases (T3N0M0 and T3N0MX) and one Stage IVa (T4N0M0). This was in part due to
concerns of further increasing the risk of cancer in the treatment field and in part due to
favorable histopathologic features. In addition, in one T3 case radiation therapy was initiated
but then discontinued due to cancer progression.

Outcomes are summarized in Table 6 and Figure 5. Local recurrence of invasive carcinoma
occurred in 44% of cases with a median time to recurrence of 17 months (range 8-93) from
the time of diagnosis. Five-year freedom from recurrence of invasive carcinoma was 46%
(SE, 15%). In three cases (12%) a second primary OSCC occurred at a non-contiguous site
from the original tumor. Five-year overall survival was 75% (SE, 22%) for patients with
premalignant changes and 70% (SE, 14%) for patients with carcinoma. The median follow-
up time for the entire cohort of patients was 47 months (95% CI 14-63).
Discussion
There are approximately 10,000 new cases of oral cancer in the US annually, with an
incidence of 10.4 cases per 100,000 and overall five-year survival rate of 51.5%. (17,18)
The primary risk factors include tobacco and alcohol, with an emerging role for HPV
infection in a subset of patients. (12,15,19,20)
We were interested describing clinical characteristics and outcomes of OED and OSCC
complicating long-term survivors of allogeneic HSCT. (8) The overall risk of second
malignancies after allogeneic HSCT has been well reported in the literature in retrospective,
observational and cohort studies. (1-3,5,21-34) However, details of the clinical aspects of
oral cancers following HSCT have only been described in case reports or small case series.
(4,14,35-37) This lack of information about the nature of oral cancer in this high-risk patient
population has hindered clinical decision-making and the ability to develop preventive
strategies and screening recommendations.
Most of our patients (24 out of 26 patients) developed cGVHD prior to the diagnosis of
OED and OSCC, and in all but one of them (23 out of 24 patients) the oral tissues were
involved. Eighty per cent of the patients with oral cGVHD received some type of localized
therapy (e.g. topical steroids) specifically for their oral cGVHD, suggesting that the disease
burden was considerable. The median interval from the diagnosis of oral cGVHD to the
diagnosis of oral cancer was six years. These findings support the model that the presence of
cGVHD, and specifically in the oral mucosa, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of
oral cancer after allogeneic HSCT. Since GVHD is an alloimmune inflammatory process,
long-term immunologically-mediated injury of the mucosa by T-cells may predispose to
genomic instability and eventually to malignant transformation, particularly in the context of
prior tobacco and alcohol use. (1) A recent study by Khan et al demonstrated genomic
instability in oral, but not nasal (which is a rare site of cGVHD) cytological samples in
patients with a history of cGVHD, providing both a direct role for cGVHD as well as a
potential mechanism of oncogenesis, as genomic instability has been recently associated
with epithelial malignancies. (1,38-40) This may be more specifically mediated by long-
term upregulation of cytokines, such as type I interferon, that are highly active in both
cGVHD as well as OSCC. (41,42,39,40) Furthermore, there is an emerging body of
evidence suggesting that, at least in some cases of secondary solid cancers, donor-derived
cells may play a role in carcinogenesis. (43,44)
The majority of the patients with oral cGVHD were treated with topical and/or intralesional
immunomodulators, including corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and
cyclosporine). While there have been case reports of skin cancer developing following local
treatment with topical tacrolimus, and two cases of oral cancer following intraoral topical
therapy, a causal relationship remains uncertain. (45-50) Nonetheless, topical tacrolimus
ointment has a FDA black box warning regarding its potential for increasing the risk of skin
cancer. It has been suggested that topically applied tacrolimus may promote carcinogenesis
through its immunosuppressive properties (51), by activating mitogen-activated protein
kinase pathways (49), which promotes cell division, or by inhibiting keratinocyte DNA

repair. (52) Systemic immunosuppressive therapy has also been identified as a potential risk
factor for oral cancer; however similar to topical therapies, the exposure and the presence of
cGVHD are closely interconnected and it therefore remains difficult to attribute any specific
carcinogenic risk. There is no information about malignant transformation associated with
the use of other topical immunosuppressive agents. Two patients from our series had
previously been managed with localized intraoral ultraviolet B phototherapy for their oral
cGVHD; however, unlike PUVA, this modality of therapy has not been associated with an
increased incidence of skin cancer when used for the management of psoriasis and other
inflammatory skin disorders.(53)
The majority of patients in our study were found to have low stage oral cancer (39% Stage I,
33% Stage II). It is noteworthy that most of these patients were routinely examined by oral
medicine specialists, due to the presence of oral cGVHD. These frequent oral evaluations
may have contributed to an earlier diagnosis of oral cancer, and perhaps to the favorable 5-
year survival rate of 70%, compared with an overall five-year survival rate of 51.5% in the
general population. (17,18,54)
Eight out of the 18 patients with oral cancer were complicated with a second oral cancer or
recurrence of the first tumor. In the non-HSCT population, the incidence of second primary
oral cancers is reported to be between 3% and 10%, compared with 45% in our series.
(55,56) Furthermore, in five patients the primary carcinoma was found in several foci. These
findings suggest that the nature of oral cancer after allogeneic HSCT may be different and
possibly more aggressive than in non-HSCT patients, perhaps due to field changes (e.g.
genomic instability) occurring as a result of long-standing oral mucosal inflammation, as
well as underlying mutagenic injury from conditioning, alcohol, and tobacco use. (40,43,57)
This is further supported by the fact that the buccal mucosa, one of the most commonly
affected intraoral sites by cGVHD, was also one of the most frequent sites of OSCC in our
series; however, buccal mucosa is not considered a high-risk site in non-HSCT patients.
(58,59) Despite these features, only one case had clinical evidence of lymph node metastasis
on presentation. Although HPV testing was not performed in this study, none of the cases
were located in the oropharynx, tonsils, or base of tongue, the three sites that have been
linked epidemiologically to HPV 16 infection.(60)
There are several limitations of this study. First, due to the retrospective study design, data
collection was limited to only those patients who had developed OSCC with the depth and
accuracy of the available medical records. Second, although this study included a relatively
large series of cancer cases, the number of patients with advanced stage (III and IV) tumors
was insufficient to evaluate with respect to efficacy of treatment or the effect of treatment
modality on the recurrence rate or survival. Considering that radiotherapy is a risk factor for
cancer (42), the question remains as to whether radiotherapy should be employed for the
treatment of oral cancer in patients with multiple other risk factors, such as conditioning
regimen, underlying hematological malignant disease, cGVHD and treatment with
immunomodulators. Lastly, while the goal of the study was to include all OED lesions in
order to delineate the malignant potential of cGVHD, the actual risks of malignant
transformation with dysplasia and VH are unknown. For this reason, cases of frank
carcinoma were considered separately from dysplasia and VH.
In summary, this is a descriptive analysis of a large and highly characterized series of
patients with OED and OSCC after allogeneic HSCT in which oral cGVHD may be
considered a potential risk factor for oral cancer and demonstrates the aggressive nature of
this serious late complication of allogeneic HSCT. Carefully coordinated long-term follow-
up by a comprehensive cancer team that includes oral medicine expertise is recommended,
and patients should be well-informed of cancer risk.(61) Large prospective multicenter

and screening strategies.

Patient was originally diagnosed with NHL, treated with autologous HSCT, and was subsequently diagnosed with secondary MDS and underwent
non-myeloablative allogeneic HSCT.

For patients who underwent multiple allogeneic transplants, only their first conditioning regimen is provided.
†††
After the first myeloablative autologous HSCT, the patient was subsequently treated with a DLI which resulted in marrow aplasia. No further
conditioning was given prior to the second allogeneic HSCT.
