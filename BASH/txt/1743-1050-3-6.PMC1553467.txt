Abstract
The publication of a report in Nature in 2004 by the Tilly group suggesting that mouse ovaries are
capable of generating oocytes de novo post-natally, has sparked interest in a problem long thought
to have been resolved from classical studies in a variety of mammalian species. Within a nearly two
year time period, laboratories around the world have taken up the challenge to dogma raised by
this initial report, either to test this concept in an experimental basic science setting or give
direction to clinical applications that could result, were the original premises of this work in the
mouse valid for extrapolation to humans. This review provides a status report for this promising
area of research, (1) to summarize recent findings in the literature with respect to the validity of
the original hypothesis proffered by the Tilly group, and, (2) to gauge the potential utility of ovarian
stem cells as a treatment for certain forms of human infertility.
The science then and now
The background for this debate derives primarily from
two papers (Table 1). Taken together, these studies [1,2]
reach the conclusion that an oocyte replenishing mecha-
nism must exist in the mouse ovary after birth to explain
variations in follicle number detected after experimental
manipulations, and during ovarian development or the
estrous cycle. Besides drawing upon follicle counting
methodology in a variety of conditions (animal age, cycle
status, recovery from ovotoxicity), expression marker data
were published prompting models of either an ovarian
epithelium-based progenitor cell for germline derivation
of new follicles [1] or a bone marrow derived stem cell
competent to hone into the ovary and generate new folli-
cles concomitant with meiotic entry for such precursor
populations [2]. While the intriguing demonstration of
stem/germline markers in human blood cells remains
uncontested, by and large all recent efforts to study this
problem have maintained focus on the murine model and
are summarized below.
Follicle counting
Three studies have appeared that address the question of
follicle dynamics and the likelihood of post-natal de novo
follicle production (Table 1). Of these, the recent article
by Kerr et al. [3] lends indirect support to the concept of
ongoing oocyte regeneration within the ovary. By using
unbiased stereological techniques to compare follicle
numbers in ovaries from neonatal and adult mice belong-
ing to the same strain studied by Johnson et al. [1,2],
maintenance of primordial follicle numbers during early
post-natal life through to middle age is demonstrated,
rather than progressive follicle loss over time reported in
previous studies. Although the persistence of follicle num-

bers points to a mechanism for sustaining the oocyte pool
in mouse ovaries over their reproductive lifespan, these
authors found no histological evidence for the existence
of ovarian germline stem cells. Drawing on stereological
measurements then raises questions about the validity of
alternative follicle counting methods and the definition of
healthy versus atretic follicles as assayed by either
approach.
The original hypothesis for oocyte and follicular renewal
takes its roots from a perceived conflict between the actual
numbers of healthy and atretic follicles present in the
ovary, compared to estimations made for the rate of folli-
cle loss [1]. In addition to providing a number of reasons
for why the assumptions and mathematical equations
used in this study were inherently flawed, Byskov et al. [4]
performed their own experiments to examine the charac-
teristics and rate of follicle atresia and in doing so arrive at
alternative explanations for the Tilly groups findings.
Byskov et al. [4] report evidence to indicate that atretic fol-
licles are actually cleared from the ovary more slowly than
originally calculated, and that the pool of atretic follicles
found on day 30 by Johnson et al. [1] likely includes
growing follicles that had degenerated many days earlier.
Thus, the claim that in the absence of continuous follicu-
lar regeneration the ovarian pool of oocytes would be pre-
maturely depleted may in fact be partially attributed to the
authors' miscalculation of the rate of atretic follicle clear-
ance.
It seems clear that a thorough understanding of follicular
dynamics, defined by the nature of both follicular pro-
gression and follicular loss, is needed before any conclu-
sions about the existence of germline stem cells can be
inferred from static studies of follicle numbers at selective
time points. With this in mind, Bristol-Gould et al. [5]
used sophisticated mathematical models, capable of
describing follicular dynamics within the ovary, to deter-
mine if replenishment of the initial primordial follicle
pool is required to support fertility throughout reproduc-
tive life. First, they counted follicles in ovaries of mice
ranging from day 6 through to 12 months. They then
applied two models to their experimental data: the fixed
pool model, which assumes the pool of primordial folli-
cles established in the ovary before birth is non-renewa-
ble; and the stem cell model, which predicts that de novo
follicle production supplements the initial follicle pool.
Despite manipulating the latter to account for different
rates of oocyte production, Bristol-Gould et al. [5] found
that only the fixed pool model accurately reflected the
observed gradual depletion of follicle numbers over time.
Their results show that the initial store of primordial fol-
licles is indeed sufficient to supply the mouse with all the
experimentally observed oocytes, and that supplementa-
tion of this original pool, in terms of number alone, is not
necessary.
With respect to stem cell behaviors, two studies are rele-
vant (Table 1). First, Byskov and colleagues [4] have
repeated the BrdU detection paradigm (using identical
mouse strains as the Tilly group) and found no evidence
for nascent DNA synthesis over a wide range of animal
ages. That the ovarian epithelium is a site of new germ
cells/follicle formation is unlikely in view of this new and
strikingly confirmatory data as it argues strongly for the
lack of a typical regenerative mechanism in the mouse
ovary. The paucity of studies on marker expression such as
those used by Johnson et al. [1] does however mean that
if such events are rare enough to escape detection by DNA
precursor loading, then these and other reagents should
be deployed to satisfactorily resolve this point. Similarly,
images purporting to demonstrate germ cells in the epi-
thelium, historically construed as being involved in
oocyte loss [6], remain enigmatic and will require reas-
sessment.
The second study from Eggan and colleagues [7] addresses
the question of bone marrow precursors to new oocytes.
Here, elegant and again historically useful approaches
employing both parabiosis between donor and host ani-

Authors Year Main findings
Johnson et al. 2004 Germline stem cells are located within the ovarian epithelium and supply the adult mouse ovary with new oocytes.
Johnson et al. 2005 Germline stem cells are present in the circulation and supply the adult mouse ovary with new oocytes.
Byskov et al. 2005 Failed to find any BrdU positive oogonia within the ovarian epithelium and provided evidence to suggest that an
overestimation of atretic follicle number contributed to Johnson et al.'s conclusions.
Oktay et al., 2005 Reported spontaneous pregnancy in presumably sterile patient following chemotherapy, hematopoeitic stem cell
transplantation and ovarian tissue transplantation.
Bristol-Gould et al. 2006 Showed that follicle numbers gradually decline in the mouse ovary with age and used mathematical modeling to
determine that de novo follicle production is not required to support fertility.
Eggan et al. 2006 Used parabiotic mice to show that ovulated oocytes do not come from circulating stem cells.
Kerr et al. 2006 Showed that follicle numbers remain constant in mouse ovaries from puberty to early mid-life, suggesting possible
follicular renewal.

mals and the bone marrow transplant procedures used by
Johnson et al. [2] form the basis for asking a simple and
oft sought after question (see commentaries by Telfer et al.
[8,9]): Can genetically marked bone marrow or blood
borne stem cells give rise to ovulated oocytes? While both
parabiotic and bone marrow transplant animals contin-
ued to respond to gonadotropins and supported induced
ovulation with high efficiency, these investigators were
unable to document ovulation of oocytes that would have
been derived from the appropriate donor tissues. More
telling perhaps was the finding that after chemical
induced oocyte ablation, sufficient stores of unaffected
oocytes were detected after induced ovulation further sug-
gesting, as have others, that the methods used to achieve
total oocyte reduction were incomplete at best. This point
will be further discussed with respect to recent reports in
humans who have re-established pregnancies following
chemotherapy treatments.
Of mice and women
Summarily then, the evidence taken from recent studies
argues against the existence of an ovarian stem cell mech-
anism that could support follicle replenishment... at least
in mice. Questions of the appropriateness of murine mod-
els to study human reproductive physiology notwith-
standing, we would like to return to the topic of stem cells
and humans as this has received much attention in the
popular press, apparently at the expense of "hard science"
from the medical community. In our estimation, the most
intriguing studies are those of Oktay and colleagues who
have been pioneers in the development ovarian restora-
tion protocols to assist young women who have under-
gone sterility-inducing cancer treatments. Heterologous
bone marrow transplant has been used for years in the
management of such patients and several reports of
restored fertility have appeared in the literature [10-12].
More recently, Oktay [13,14] has reported a cancer patient
who, after experiencing more than two years of meno-
pause as a consequence of receiving sterilizing chemother-
apy prior to hematopoeitic stem cell transplantation,
conceived twice immediately following transplantation of
her own cryopreserved ovarian tissue. The origin of the
pregnancies are unknown, but were likely due to the
spontaneous recovery of her existing ovary. The potential
contribution of circulating germline stem cells to these
pregnancies remains unexplored. The case for a blood
borne/bone marrow stem cell capable of replenishing the
human ovary require serious consideration in view of
reports of this kind and all efforts to translate cases of this
nature into a treatment strategy should be encouraged and
pursued. Surely, were this the case, then appropriate
genetic evidence can and should be brought to bear on the
thousands of patients who have conceived following
chemotherapy and these results are ones all in this field
are anticipating.
Conclusion
Evidence from a number of laboratories collectively raise
concerns over the validity of the ovarian stem cell mecha-
nism for follicle replenishment as originally proposed by
Johnson et al. [1,2]. However, recent reports on fertility
restoration in humans are promising and warrant further
study as hopes for novel fertility techniques are legiti-
mized and the prospect that germline regeneration, while
unlikely to occur in mice, may have some basis in pri-
mates.
