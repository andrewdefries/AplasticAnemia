Abstract
Studies have compared the role of bone mar-
row aspirate cytology and trephine biopsy for
diagnosing various hematological disorders
but fewer studies have compared the relative
value of imprint cytology with aspirate and
trephine biopsy. The present study was con-
ducted to compare the role of bone marrow
aspirate, touch imprint and trephine biopsy to
formulate an effective and rapid method for
diagnosing wide spectrum of hematological
diseases. The study included total 565 cases of
bone marrow examination from January 2006
till May 2010. All the smears and sections were
reviewed for morphological details and find-
ings on aspirate, imprint and biopsy were com-
pared to each other. The diagnostic accuracy of
bone marrow aspirate was 77.5%, imprint
cytology 83.7% and that of biopsy was of 99.2%.
The study showed 78% positive correlation
between aspirate and biopsy and 84.3%
between imprint and biopsy; 93.3% cases of
metastatic solid tumors were correctly diag-
nosed on imprint while only 70% cases were
diagnosed on aspirate cytology. The study con-
cludes that all the three preparations of aspi-
rate, imprint and biopsy complement each
other. The assessment of iron status by Perl’s
stain is most suitable on aspirate smears but
trephine biopsy remains the gold standard for
diagnosing granulomatous inflammation and
hypoplastic/ aplastic anemia. Meticulously pre-
pared imprint smears not only provide cellular
composition of marrow but may also be helpful
in defining the architecture of marrow espe-
cially in cases of metastatic solid tumors.
Imprint cytology smears should be standard
practice for evaluating any marrow.
Introduction
Bone marrow examination is an important
diagnostic tool to evaluate various disorders
including both neoplastic and non neoplastic
hematological diseases. The bone marrow
evaluation may either confirm clinically sus-
pected disease or may provide the previously
unsuspected diagnosis.1,2 Bone marrow aspi-
rate cytology (BMA), touch imprint cytology
(BMI) and trephine biopsy (BMB) are the
three main basic preparations for bone mar-
row evaluation. Although studies have com-
pared the role of bone marrow aspirate cytol-
ogy and trephine biopsy for diagnosing various
hematological disorders but fewer studies
have compared the relative value of imprint
cytology with aspirate and trephine biopsy.3-5
The present study was therefore conducted to
compare the role of bone marrow aspirate
cytology, touch imprint cytology and trephine
biopsy to formulate an effective and rapid
method for diagnosing wide spectrum of
hematological diseases.
Materials and Methods
The study was conducted in the hematology
laboratory of the institute which included total
565 cases of bone marrow examination from
January 2006 till May 2010. Only these cases in
which bone marrow examination was done by
using all the three methods of BMA, BMI and
BMB were included in the study. The standard
technique was employed for obtaining the
aspirate samples using the Salah’s needle from
posterior superior iliac spine. The trephine
biopsy was performed using Jamshidi needle
with the length of the biopsy core ranging from
1 to 3 cm. The biopsy was then fixed for mini-
mum of 24 h in 10% buffered formalin and
then decalcified overnight in mixture of 8%
hydrochloric acid and 10% formic acid in equal
amounts. Before fixation of the biopsy mini-
mum five touch imprint smears were prepared
by using the procedure of gentle touch and
rolling of the biopsy core on the slide. The fix-
ation of the biopsy core was followed by auto-
mated tissue processing, paraffin embedding
and sectioning. All the aspirate and touch
imprint smears were routinely stained by
Jenner Giemsa while the trephine biopsy sec-
tions were stained by routine Hematoxyline
Eosin stain along with reticulin stain. Perl’s
iron stain was performed for every case on
BMA, BMI smears and BMB sections. The rele-
vant cytochemistry and immunochemistry
staining was performed as and when required.
In 4 cases of suspected metastasis bilateral
trephine biopsy was performed. All the smears
and sections were reviewed for morphological
details by two pathologists and the findings on
BMA, BMI and BMB were compared to each
other for final diagnosis.
Results
A total of 565 cases underwent bone marrow
examination from January 2006 till May 2010
in which all the three types of preparation
including BMA, BMI and BMB were made. Out
of these 438 cases were diagnosed on BMA
with diagnostic accuracy of 77.5%. 473 cases
were diagnosed on BMI with diagnostic accu-
racy of 83.7% and 561 cases were diagnosed on
BMB with diagnostic accuracy of 99.2%. Table
1 shows the total cases diagnosed on BMA,
BMI and BMB. It shows that none of the cases
of granulomatous inflammation and hypoplas-
tic/aplastic anemia was diagnosed on BMA and
BMI cytology. Anemia of chronic disorder was
the only group of disease in which 4 cases out
of total 22 cases were not diagnosed on BMB
while all the 22 cases were diagnosed on BMA.
Table 2 shows the cases having positive corre-
lation between BMA cytology and BMB sec-
tions and between BMI cytology and BMB sec-
tions. It shows that 78% cases showed positive
correlation between BMA and BMB while
84.3% cases showed positive correlation
between BMI and BMB. Table 3 shows the
cases where findings on BMA, BMI and BMB
differed from final diagnosis. It shows that
hematological malignancies which were not
diagnosed on BMA were either due to dry tap
because of fibrosis or packed marrow. Perl’s
iron stain demonstrated reduced or no iron in
10 cases on BMI and 4 cases on BMB while all
22 cases showed iron on BMA. Two cases of
positive metastatic solid tumors on BMB
showed normal or hypocellular marrow on BMI
and 8 cases were normal or hypocellular on
BMA cytology.

Discussion
The comparative evaluation of BMA, BMI
and BMB is essential so that more rapid and
efficient method may be defined for diagnos-
ing various hematological disorders. The pres-
ent study observed that although the diagnos-
tic accuracy of BMB was highest (99.2%) but
diagnostic accuracy of BMI was also consider-
ably high (83.7%) in comparison to BMA
(77.5%) in diagnosing various hematological
disorders. This is in contrast to other studies
which have observed imprint cytology to be of
limited valve except in cases of dry tap.5 The
efficacy of BMI cytology observed in the study
was specially related to diagnosis of metastat-
ic solid tumors (Figure 1) and lymphomas.
93.3% cases of metastatic solid tumors were
correctly diagnosed on BMI cytology in compar-
ison to 70% cases on BMA in the study.
However, BMB was the standard procedure
which diagnosed all the cases of metastatic
solid tumors. Donald et al. have also reported
that on comparative evaluation of BMA, BMI
and BMB, the aspirate was positive in 33%
cases, touch imprints in 90% cases and biopsy
sections were positive in all the cases.6
Although studies have shown that trephine
biopsy was 2.6 times positive compared to aspi-
rate for detection of metastasis but the present
showed that meticulously prepared imprint
smears with close search of metastatic cells on
aspirate smears could have diagnostic accura-
cy (93.3%) almost similar to that of trephine
biopsy (100%). The authors also suggest that
detection of metastatic cells on BMI in sus-
pected cases can be increased by performing
bilateral bone marrow examination which can
detect focal involvement of marrow also. In the
present study lymphoma was diagnosed in all
cases on BMB but touch imprints also consid-
erably increased the chances of detection of
lymphoma cells (88.2%) in comparison to BMA
smears (52.9%) (Figure 2). Aboul Nasr R et al.
have also observed that lymphoma cells were
easily detected in all cases on touch imprints
while in 83% cases lymphoma cells were
observed on aspirate smears.7 This is in con-
trast to other studies which observed that
touch imprints do not improve the ability to
diagnose lymphoma cells in comparison to
aspirate smears.8,9 The authors suggest that
although the tophographical arrangement of
lymphoma cells are best seen on biopsy sec-
tions but this arrangement can also be well
appreciated in meticulously prepared touch
imprint cytology smears. Another interesting
feature that was observed in the study was that
Perl’s iron stain was best demonstrated on
aspirate smears in comparison to imprint
smears and biopsy sections. The probable
cause may be due to loss of iron during pro-
cessing of biopsy sections. This was the possi-
ble reason that the anemia of chronic disorder
was not diagnosed in 4 cases on BMB and thus
reducing the diagnostic accuracy of BMB to
99.3%. However another study has observed
BMB to have significantly higher positivity
rate for assessing iron stores in comparison to
smears.10 Granulomatous inflammation was
diagnosed in none of the cases on BMA and
BMI smears in the present study (Figure 3).
This is mainly because of focal involvement of

the marrow by granulomas which is very diffi-
cult to be detected on aspirate and imprint
smears. However this limitation can be over-
come by performing bilateral trephine biopsy
procedure so that chances of detecting granulo-
mas on imprint smears could be increased but
in the present study none of the case of granu-
lomatous inflammation had bilateral bone mar-
row examination. Other studies have also
observed the detection of granulomas more on
BMB sections in comparison to aspirate
smears.2,11 For diagnosing of hematological
malignancies the BMA and BMI smears were
almost as reliable as BMB, however, with
slightly higher detection rate by BMI (97.5%) in
comparison to BMA (92.5%). The predominant
reason for not diagnosing leukemia on BMA
was dry tap due to either marrow fibrosis or
tightly packed marrow by leukemic cells. Aboul
Nasr R et al. have also observed that BMI cytol-
ogy was reliable for making diagnosis of hema-
tological malignancies especially in cases of dry
tap due to fibrosis or dilution of aspirate by
peripheral blood.7 BMB remains the gold stan-
dard for diagnosing hypoplastic/ aplastic ane-
mia with none of the cases being diagnosed on
aspirate and imprint smears. Although 89.2%
cases showed hypocellular marrow/dry tap on
BMA or BMI due to marrow fibrosis but the con-
firmation of fibrosis by reticulin stain was pos-
sible only on trephine biopsy.
The authors further suggest that the ade-
quacy of touch imprint smears in diagnosing
most of the hematological disorders may be
related to meticulously prepared imprint
smears which requires not only gentle touch of
the biopsy core on slides to prevent crush arti-
fact but also preparation of touch smears by
gentle rolling the core so that impression of
the cells are made by almost all aspects of the
core biopsy. This procedure will enhance the
detection of focal involvement marrow also. In
addition it may also avoid the unnecessary
delay caused by decalcification and processing
of trephine biopsy sections in routine
histopathology labs.
Conclusions
The study concludes that all the three prepa-
rations of aspirate cytology, touch imprint
cytology and trephine biopsy complement each
other for evaluating any bone marrow. The

assessment of iron status by Perl’s stain is
although not adequate on biopsy sections in
comparison to aspirate smears but trephine
biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnos-
ing granulomatous inflammation and
hypoplastic/ aplastic anemia. Vigilant exami-
nation of aspirate smears and meticulously
prepared imprint cytology smears are almost
equally efficient and more rapid method for
diagnosis metastatic solid tumors in compari-
son to trephine biopsy. Appropriately prepared
imprint cytology smears do not only adequate-
ly provide cellular composition of marrow but
may also define the topographical architecture
of marrow. Imprint cytology smears should
therefore be standard practice for evaluating
any marrow.
