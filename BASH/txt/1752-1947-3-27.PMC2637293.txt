Abstract
Introduction: Hypocellular variants of acute myeloid leukemia are very rare and almost always
occur in old aged patients. In contrast, hypocellular acute lymphoblastic leukemia usually occurs in
children.
Case presentation: We report two Indian patients with hypocellular acute myeloid leukemia, a
32-year-old woman and a 13-year-old boy. Interestingly, one of the patients also showed bone
marrow necrosis.
Conclusion: Hypocellular acute myeloid leukemia is a rare entity and can affect young individuals.
It can be considered as a rare cause of bone marrow necrosis.
Introduction
The infrequent occurrence of hypocellularity at presenta-
tion of acute leukemia has been widely recognized.
Hypocellular variants of acute leukemia almost always
have a myeloid phenotype and usually develop secondary
to radiation or chemotherapy [1,2]. They thus occur
mainly in adults [2]. This paper describes two rare cases of
hypocellular acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in young
patients (a 32-year-old woman and a 13-year-old boy).
Bone marrow necrosis (BMN) is a distinctive clinico-
pathologic entity characterized by necrosis of the medul-
lary stroma and myeloid tissues [3]. Its etiology is diverse,
and malignancy, especially hematopoietic in origin, is the
most common underlying disease of BMN [4]. Hypocellu-
lar AML may be one of the important causes of BMN.
Interestingly, in one of our patients we found grade 1
BMN.
Case presentation
Case 1
A 32-year-old Indian woman presented with fever, gener-
alized weakness, dyspnea on exertion and easy fatigability
over a 3-month period. On examination, she had moder-
ate pallor. There was no lymph node enlargement or orga-
nomegaly. Hematologic examination revealed
hemoglobin of 5.3 g%, total leukocyte count of 9,100/
mm3, and platelets of 15,000/mm3. No atypical cells were
seen on peripheral blood smear examination. A clinical
possibility of aplastic anemia was considered and bone
marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed. Bone mar-
row aspirate smears were aparticulate and diluted with
peripheral blood. However, there was an increase in the
number of blasts. Correct blast enumeration was not pos-
sible due to dilution of aspirate by peripheral blood; how-
ever, blasts were the predominant cells. These blasts were
large and had a scant to moderate amount of cytoplasm,
opened-up chromatin and conspicuous nucleoli. Normal

hematopoietic elements were markedly diminished.
Cytochemically, these blasts were myeloperoxidase
(MPO) positive. Based on all these features, a tentative
diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia French-American-
British (FAB) subtype M1 (AML-M1) was made. Subse-
quently, trephine biopsy showed hypocellular marrow
spaces with clusters of blasts in places. Erythroid series of
cells were relatively preserved, however, myeloid and
megakaryocytic lineages were markedly suppressed (Fig-
ure 1a, b). In addition, a focus of necrosis involving less
than 20% of the biopsy area, along with scattered blasts
was also seen at one edge of the biopsy (Figure 1c, d).
Stains for acid fast bacilli and fungal organisms were neg-
ative, however, dispersed blasts were positive for anti-
MPO stain. In view of the abovementioned findings, a
diagnosis of hypocellular AML was established along with
a focal area of necrosis. The patient was referred to a terti-
ary health care center for further management.
Case 2
A 13-year-old Indian boy presented after a 10-day episode
of right submandibular swelling. On examination, he had
severe pallor and an enlarged hot and tender right sub-
mandibular gland. He had hepatomegaly. On ultrasono-
graphic examination, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes
were identified. Hematologic examination revealed
hemoglobin of 6.9 gm%, a total leukocyte count of 2,600/
mm3, and platelet count of 35,000/mm3. Peripheral
blood smear examination revealed 40% blasts with low
platelets. These blasts were of intermediate size, had mod-
erate cytoplasm, opened-up nuclear chromatin and 1 to 4
prominent nucleoli. Bone marrow aspirate and imprint
smears were hypocellular for the age of the patient (less
than 50% cellularity). There was an increased amount of
fat, and marrow cells were replaced by blasts (88% of mar-
row cells) (Figure 2a, b). Normal hematopoietic elements
were markedly diminished. Cytochemically, these blasts
were myeloperoxidase positive. Trephine biopsy also dis-
played hypocellularity along with aggregates of blasts
which were anti-MPO positive. In addition, foci of gelati-
nous marrow transformation were also identified. Finally,
a diagnosis of hypocellular AML FAB subtype M1 was
made. Chemotherapy was started, however, he suc-
cumbed 3 days after the diagnosis.
Unfortunately, clonal chromosomal abnormalities could
not be evaluated in either patient due to unavailability of
the facility in the department.
Discussion
The occurrence of hypoplastic acute leukemia is widely
recognized as an atypical leukemia, and is defined as
hypocellular marrow with ≥20% blasts and none or few
blasts in the circulating blood [5]. Clinically, it usually fol-
lows a less progressive course and has a high prevalence
rate among the elderly. Although hypocellular acute lym-
phoblastic leukemias (ALL) almost always occur in chil-
dren [2], to the best of our knowledge, hypocellular AML
has not been reported in young and pediatric patients.
There are many case series and individual case reports of
hypoplastic acute leukemia available in the literature.
Nagai et al. [1] proposed the following diagnostic criteria:
pancytopenia with rare appearance of blasts in peripheral
blood; less than 40% bone marrow hypocellularity; more
than 30% blasts in bone marrow of all nucleated cells;
and myeloid phenotypes of leukemic blasts by myeloper-
oxidase staining and/or immunophenotyping. Both of
our patients fulfilled the abovementioned criteria except
for the presence of 40% blasts in the peripheral smear in
case 2. In both of our patients, almost all of the cells could
be identified as blast cells, which made up more than 50%
of nucleated marrow cells. FAB classification revealed a
preponderance of the M1 category followed by M2 and
M6 types [6]. We reported both of the cases as FAB M1
subtype, as there was less than 10% differentiation in the
myeloid lineage and erythroid precursors were scarce.
Moreover, there was no evidence of myelodysplasia.
Beard et al. [7] and Needleman et al. [8] have reported
their experience with hypoplastic acute leukemia and sug-
gested that patients with hypocellular bone marrow expe-
rience a more indolent course, and can commonly achieve
a good response to remission induction therapy. This dis-
ease has a proclivity for older patients, however, we found
it in young patients. Although the majority of hypocellu-
lar acute leukemias are of myeloid type, rare case reports
of hypocellular ALL are reported in the literature [9].
Hypocellular ALL usually presents in children but cases in
elderly have been documented [9]. Recently, hypocellular
acute promyelocytic leukemia with a tetraploid clone has
also been reported [10]. The question of pathogenesis of
the hypocellularity remains speculative. It is unclear
whether the leukemia is secondary to the hypocellularity
or if it is the primary event. It has been suggested that
leukemia cell populations inhibit myelopoiesis through a
humoral mechanism [11]. Alternatively, an increased sus-
ceptibility of myeloid precursors to the inhibitor in older
patients might play a role in the genesis of hypoplasia [8].
However, the cause of hypoplasia in children needs to be
elucidated. Although these patients appear to bear rela-
tively low tumor cell burdens, the disease may pursue an
aggressive course. In this report, case 2 died even after
chemotherapy; unfortunately, we do not have follow-up
of case 1. Recently, the beneficial effects of hematopoietic
growth factors have been reported in the treatment of
hypoplastic AML. It has been observed that chemotherapy
may be necessary to maintain remission in hypoplastic
AML after hematopoietic reconstitution by granulocyte
colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) [12]. Although acute
leukemia has been found to be the most common under-
lying cause of bone marrow necrosis [4], we did not find

an association of BMN with hypoplastic AML in the liter-
ature. We have seen grade 1 BMN in case 1 along with
scattered anti-MPO positive blasts. BMN was graded sem-
iquantitatively according to the extent of necrosis in the
bone marrow biopsy described by Maisel et al. [3].
Conclusion
Hypoplastic acute myeloid leukemia is a distinct nosolo-
gic entity and can affect young individuals. It can be added
to the growing body of literature as a rare cause of BMN.
