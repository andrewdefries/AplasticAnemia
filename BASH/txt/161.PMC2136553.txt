(Received for publication, October 3, 1955)
In the preceding publication (1) the results of studies on the kinetics of
iron metabolism (2-5) in normal growing swine were reported. The purpose
of this paper is to present the results of similar studies in swine with three
different types of experimentally induced anemias. As an example of a severe
hemolytic process with no detectable impairment in the capacity of the bone
marrow to produce erythrocytes, anemia induced by the administration of
phenylhydrazine (6) has been studied. The kinetics of iron metabolism have
been studied also in swine with anemia due to a deficiency of pyridoxine
(6--8) and in swine with anemia due to a deficiency of pteroylglutamic acid
(9-11). The last two anemias are quite different morphologically. That ane-
mia associated with pyridoxine deficiency is microcytic and hypochromic,
whereas that occurring in pteroylglutamic acid deficiency is macrocytic. In
both, the plasma iron level is greatly elevated, there is a reduction in the
amount of free protoporphyrin in the erythrocytes, and there is erythroid
hyperplasia in the bone marrow. However, the tissues of the pyridoxine-
deficient animals are heavily laden with iron, whereas hemosiderin deposits are
not prominent in the tissues of swine deficient in pteroylglutamic acid.
These studies were carried out in the hope of gaining an understanding of
the pathogenesis of the anemia in these conditions and also with the expec-
tation that these anemias of known and singular etiology might serve as
patterns of reference for anemias which develop in human subjects. In a
later publication (12) iron kinetics will be described in copper-deficient swine.
The anemia accompanying that condition is microcytic and hypochromic
and the level of iron in the plasma and tissues is low.

162 IRON METABOLISM IN SWINE WITH ANEMIA
Methods
Nine swine of the Chester-White breed were used in this study. Pteroylglutamie acid
deficiency was produced by feeding a 26 per cent "purified" casein diet supplemented with
sulfasuxidine and crude methyl folic acid antagonist (10). The diet used for the production of
pyridoxine deficiency has been described previously (6). The animals given phenylhydrazine
were fed the standard 26 per cent crude casein diet with a complete vitamin and mineral
supplement (13).

Phenylhydrazine was administered orally to 3 of the swine in daily doses during the week
prior to the ferrokinetic study. 2 gm. per day was given for the first 2 days. Thereafter, the
dose was adjusted daily so that the volume of packed red cells was between 20 and 30 ml./100
ml. at the time of the ferrokinetic study.
Hematologic studies (red cell count, hemoglobin concentration, volume of packed red cells,
calculation of the corpuscular constants, reticulocyte, total leukocyte, and differential leuko-
cyte counts) were performed weekly. In addition, the volume of packed red cells and hemo-
globin concentration were determined daily during the ferrokinetic study.
The techniques used in this study and the calculation of the data were the same as those
described in the preceding publication (1) with the exception that the radioiron was prein-
cubated with plasma from normal swine because of the possibility that the iron-binding pro-
tein in the animals with experimentally induced anemias might already be saturated.
Data concerning the individual pigs are given in Table I.

The rate of incorporation of radioiron into the erythrocytes is shown in
Fig. 1. All 3 of the animals incorporated the isotope into red cells more rap-
idly than did the normal pigs, and plateau concentrations were reached sooner.
An average of 86 per cent of the administered activity was ultimately in-
corporated as compared with 92 per cent in the normal animals. This differ-
ence in the amount incorporated by the two groups is probably not significant
since it is likely that some of the labelled red cells in the anemic animals were
hemolyzed as soon as they were released into the circulation.
164 IRON METABOLISM IN SWINE WITH ANEMIA
The average amount of iron incorporated into red cells daily by the anemic
animals was 4.23 mg./kg, of body weight, a value 4.2 times the normal mean.
Of this amount, 4.14 mg. or 97 per cent was turning over through the red
cells since only 0.10 mg./kg, was accounted for by growth of the animals. By
calculation, the average RBC life span in the animals given phenylhydrazine
was 5 days as compared with a mean of 63 days in the normal pigs.

Anemia Due to Pyridoxine Deficiency.--The plasma iron level was elevated
in all 3 animals (Table I). The ferrokinetic data are presented in Table II.
In 2 of the pigs the radioiron disappeared from the plasma at the normal
rate. The disappearance rate in the 3rd animal (13-44) was slower than nor-
mal. The plasma iron turnover rate was greatly increased in all 3 pigs. The
rate of incorporation of iron into erythrocytes was slower than in normal
BUSH, JENSEN, ASHENBRUCKER, CARTWRIGHT, AND WINTROBE 165
animals and an average of 6 per cent of the administered radioactivity was
ultimately incorporated into the red cells as compared with 92 per cent in
the normal pigs. The average amount of iron incorporated into erythrocytes
each day was 0.27 mg./kg, of body weight or only about one-fourth of the
average amount incorporated into the erythrocytes of the normal swine. The
average life span of the erythrocytes was calculated to be 49 days, a value
within the normal limits.

Anemia Due to a Deficiency of Pteroylglutamic Acid.--The plasma iron level
was elevated in all 3 animals (Table I) and the radioactivity disappeared
from the plasma at a normal rate in 2 pigs and at a slightly reduced rate in
1 animal (13-87). The plasma iron turnover rate was about 5 times the nor-
mal mean in all 3 of the pigs (Table II). The rate of incorporation of iron
into erythrocytes was slower than in normal animals and an average of only
28 per cent of the administered isotope was incorporated into the red cells.
However, the amount of iron incorporated into red cells each day was in-
creased beyond the upper limit of normal in 2 pigs and was within the nor-
mal range in 1 of them. After adjustment for the growth of the animals, the
amount of iron turned over through the red cells each day was found to be
I66 IRON METABOLISM IN SWINE WITH ANEMIA
increased in 2 and normal in 1 pig (13-88). The average amount of iron turned
over through the red cells by the 3 pigs was approximately twice normal.
The calculated red cell life span was shortened in all three animals. The mean
value was 17 days as compared with 63 days in the normal pigs.
Body surface radioactivity was determined over the liver, spleen, and
sacral bone marrow sites of two of the pteroylglutamic acid-deficient pigs.
The results are presented in Fig. 2 and are compared with the results ob-
tained in 2 normal swine. No significant difference was noted in the rate of
uptake of radioiron into the three sites as compared with that in normal
animals. Although the height of the initial peak was somewhat higher in
the deficient animals than in the normal ones, this difference is probably not
significant since the deficient animals had less subcutaneous tissue and the
counter was closer to the target organ. The rate of release of the isotope from
the liver, spleen, and sacral bone marrow sites of the deficient animals was
greatly retarded.
DISCUSSION
In the previous publication (1) the assumptions and errors involved in
ferrokinetic studies were discussed. Ferrokinetic calculations are made on
the assumption that the rate of production of cells is equal to the rate of
their destruction, and therefore, that red cell volume is constant. To main-
tain anemic animals in a state of hemopoietic equilibrium for any period of
time is indeed difficult. On the other hand, the deficient animals and the ani-
mals given phenylhydrazine grew very little, if at all, during the period of
study. In order to make the data comparable to those in rapidly growing
control animals we have corrected for the small degree of growth of the ane-
mic pigs although this correction does not modify the data significantly.
The ferrokinetic studies revealed striking differences between the 3 experi-
mentally induced anemias. In the animals given phenylhydrazine the life
span of the erythrocytes was shortened markedly. The values obtained for
the life span in these animals are only approximate because it was difficult
to maintain a constant volume of packed red ceils during the period of study.
Furthermore, when the life span of the erythrocytes is shortened so dras-
tically it is difficult to determine the exact proportion of isotope which is
incorporated into the red cells since a portion of the cells is destroyed as rap-
idly as they are labelled and discharged into the blood (2). Finally, the deter-
mination of the red cell volume with P3~-tagged red cells may not be accurate
under such conditions since some of the tagged cells may be rapidly elimi-
nated with the result that the value may be falsely high.
Animals given phenylhydrazine incorporated 4.2 times as much iron into
hemoglobin per day as did the normal pigs. Since this rate of production was
not sufficient to prevent the development of anemia it is likely that this was
the maximum rate at which the bone marrows of these animals could produce
BUSH~JENSEN, ASHENBRUCKER,CARTWRIGHT,AND WlNTROBE 167
hemoglobin. If one assumes that 100 per cent of the iron turned over through
the plasma actually entered the bone marrow for use in erythropoiesis, the
red cell output, as measured by the red blood cell iron incorporation rate,
increased fivefold. If it is assumed that the phenylhydrazine did not impair
the capacity of the marrow to produce erythrocytes, then the bone marrow
of normal swine can increase the output of red cells by a factor of four to
five. This value is similar to, but a little less than, that estimated in man
(14). This means that if the capacity of the marrow to produce cells is not
impaired, the marrow can compensate for a reduction in the life span of the
cells to one-fourth or one-fifth of the normal value. Since the life span of
porcine erythrocytes is normally about 63 days (1, 13), a normal marrow
should be able to produce enough erythrocytes to prevent the development
of anemia if the life span is not shorter than 13 to 16 days.
The ferrokinetic pattern in the pyridoxine-deficient swine was quite dif-
ferent from that in the animals given phenylhydrazine. In this deficiency
the life span of the cells was within normal limits, and only 0.27 rag. of iron
per kg. of body weight per day was incorporated into hemoglobin. Therefore,
these animals were producing about one-fourth as much hemoglobin as the
normal animals and about one-sixteenth as much as the animals given phen-
ylhydrazine. Thus, the anemia in this deficiency was due to an inability of
the marrow to produce a normal number of cells.
The high plasma iron turnover rate in pyridoxine deficiency is interesting
in view of the fact that only about 0.4 per cent of the iron which was turned
over each day through the plasma appeared in the erythrocytes. Two ex-
planations for this phenomenon come to mind. It is known that the tissue
stores of iron are greatly increased in pyridoxine deficiency (7) and it is pos-
sible that there is a rapid turnover between the plasma and the tissue iron.
The other explanation is that the iron goes to the marrow, is incorporated
into heme, and then the heme is catabolized before it can appear in the cells
in the circulation. That this is an unlikely explanation is indicated by the
observation that the excretion of bile pigment is not increased (6).
Pyridoxine deficiency in swine differs from aplastic anemia in human sub-
jects in that in the latter condition the plasma iron turnover rate is normal
or decreased (2, 5). It does, however, from a kinetic standpoint, resemble
the refractory pancytopenia associated with a cellular marrow (5).
The mean survival time of the erythrocytes of the animals deficient in
pteroylglutamic acid was decreased to an average of 17 days. However, the
bone marrow was able to increase its production rate only about 1.6 times
the normal rate. Thus, anemia developed because of two defects: a decrease
of the erythrocyte survival time and a limitation of the capacity of the bone
marrow to increase the production of cells to the same extent as in the ani-
mals given phenylhydrazine.
The similarities between the ferrokinetic patterns in pteroylglutamic acid-
168 IRON METABOLISM IN SWINE WITH ANEMIA
deficient swine and patients with pernicious anemia in relapse are striking.
In both conditions the plasma iron level is increased (6, 8, 15), the amount
of iron turned over through the plasma each day is increased (2, 16, 17), the
red cell uptake of radioiron is low (2), the red cell iron turnover rate is normal
or increased only slightly (2), and the survival time of the erythrocytes is
shortened (18-20). It has been suggested by several observers (5, 16, 21, 22)
that there may be rapid destruction of red cell precursors in the marrow of
patients with pernicious anemia. If such is the case, there would be an iron
compartment in the marrow with a short turnover time through which re-
cycling of iron would take place. This would account for the excessive turn-
over of iron through the plasma. Our data in the pteroylglutamic acid-defi-
cient swine could also be interpreted in this manner. If this interpretation
is correct, it would be expected that the excretion of bile pigment would be
increased as it is known to be in pernicious anemia. Unfortunately, such
measurements have not been made in pteroylglutamic acid-deficient swine.
Another explanation for the fivefold increase in the plasma iron turnover
rate in the presence of a mean red cell iron incorporation of only 1.6 times
normal is that there is considerable exchange of iron between the non-hemo-
globin tissues and the plasma. The body surface counts do not help to clarify
this problem since the delivery of isotope from the bone marrow was retarded
to the same degree as that from the liver and spleen. Furthermore, it is pos-
sible that much of the activity attributed to the liver and spleen was due to
the proximity of the ribs to these sites (1).
In the past, the anemias of nutritional origin have been classified as being
due to decreased red cell production (23, 24). The data presented in this
paper suggest that the pathogenesis of all types of anemia due to nutritional
deficiency may not be similar. A shortened erythrocyte life span has now
been demonstrated not only in anemia due to pteroylgintamic acid deficiency
in swine but also in swine deficient in copper (12), in scorbutic human sub-
jects with anemia (25, 26), and in patients with pernicious anemia (18-20).
Thus, it is apparent that decreased blood production is not the only factor
involved in the pathogenesis of some anemias of nutritional origin, although
this is apparently the only factor involved in the pathogenesis of the anemia
due to a deficiency Of pyridoxine in swine. Current knowledge concerning
the kinetic pattern in various forms of nutritional anemia in man and swine
is summarized in Table III.
The mechanisms whereby the life span of erythrocytes is decreased in the
different deficiency states have not been adequately studied. Those studies
which have been done suggest that the mechanism may not be the same in
each deficiency. Studies in this laboratory (12) on the nature of the hemo-
lytic mechanism of the anemia of copper deficiency in swine suggest that
the defect is primarily intracorpuscular. Studies by the Ashby technique
BUSH, JENSEN, ASHENBRUCKER, CARTWRIGHT, AND WINTROBE 169
indicate that normal red cells are destroyed at an accelerated rate in scor-
butic individuals (25). Data are not available on the survival of cells from
patients with scurvy transfused into normal subjects. Several observers (18,
19) have demonstrated that the life span of cells from a patient with perni-
cious anemia, transfused into a normal recipient, is moderately impaired. It
has been suggested that, in addition to the intracorpuscular defect in this
disease, there is an extracorpuscular hemolytic mechanism (27).
Several general observations can be made from the ferrokinetic data ob-
tained in this study. The PITR was increased to approximately the same
extent in each experimental group and yet red cell production ranged from
markedly reduced to markedly increased. Thus, it is apparent that the plasma
iron turnover rate is of no value in the estimation of the rate of erythropoie-

sis. The uptake of Fe59 into the red cells was markedly reduced in pteroyl-
glutamic acid deficiency and yet the production of red cells was apparently
greater than in the normal animMs. Thus, the uptake of radioiron by itself
is of no value in predicting the rate of red cell synthesis. A complete study
must be performed in order to understand the kinetic pattern.
S ~ R Y
Ferrokinetic studies were performed on 3 swine given phenylhydrazine,
3 swine deficient in pyridoxine, and 3 swine deficient in pteroylglutamic
acid. Body surface radioactivity was measured in 2 pteroylglutamic acid-
deficientanimals.
In the animals given phenylhydrazine, the mean erythrocyte survival
time was 5 days. The plasma iron turnover rate was increased about fourfold,
and the rate of erythropoiesis was four to five times greater than that in
the control pigs.
In the pyridoxine-deficient swine, the mean erythrocyte survival time
was within the limits of normal. The plasma iron turnover rate was increased
170 IRON METABOLISM IN SWINE WITH ANEMIA
fourfold, but the rate of erythropoiesis was approximately one-fourth the
normal mean value. These data are interpreted as indicating that the anemia
associated with this deficiency is a result of an inability of the bone marrow
to produce a normal number of erythrocytes.
In the pteroylglutamic acid-deficient swine, the mean erythrocyte sur-
vival time was 17 days. The plasma iron turnover rate was 5 times the nor-
mal mean value. The rate of erythropoiesis was 1.6 times greater than the
mean value in the control pigs. These data are interpreted as indicating that
anemia develops in this deficiency as a result of a combination of a shorten-
ing of the erythrocyte survival time and a limitation of the capacity of the
bone marrow to increase red cell production to the same degree as a normal
marrow.
The radioactivity in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow of the pteroylglu-
tamic acid-deficient swine, as determined by measurement of the radioac-
tivity over the body surface, declined more slowly than in control pigs.
