Abstract
Background: Leukocytes play an important role in the human immune system. The family of leukocytes is
comprised of lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils. Any infection or acute stress may
increase or decrease the number of leukocytes. An increased percentage of neutrophils may be caused by an
acute infection, while an increased percentage of lymphocytes can be caused by a chronic bacterial infection. It is
important to realize an abnormal variation in the leukocytes. The five types of leukocytes can be distinguished by
their cytoplasmic granules, staining properties of the granules, size of cell, the proportion of the nuclear to the
cytoplasmic material, and the type of nucleolar lobes. The number of lobes increased when leukemia, chronic
nephritis, liver disease, cancer, sepsis, and vitamin B12 or folate deficiency occurred. Clinical neutrophil
hypersegmentation has been widely used as an indicator of B12 or folate deficiency.Biomedical technologists can
currently recognize abnormal leukocytes using human eyes. However, the quality and efficiency of diagnosis may
be compromised due to the limitations of the biomedical technologists’ eyesight, strength, and medical
knowledge. Therefore, the development of an automatic leukocyte recognition system is feasible and necessary.
It is essential to extract the leukocyte region from a blood smear image in order to develop an automatic
leukocyte recognition system. The number of lobes increased when leukemia, chronic nephritis, liver disease,
cancer, sepsis, and vitamin B12 or folate deficiency occurred. Clinical neutrophil hypersegmentation has been
widely used as an indicator of B12 or folate deficiency.
Results: The purpose of this paper is to contribute an automatic leukocyte nuclei image segmentation method for
such recognition technology. The other goal of this paper is to develop the method of counting the number of
lobes in a cell nucleus. The experimental results demonstrated impressive segmentation accuracy.
Conclusions: Insensitive to the variance of images, the LNS (Leukocyte Nuclei Segmentation) method functioned
well to isolate the leukocyte nuclei from a blood smear image with much better UR (Under Segmentation Rate), ER
(Overall Error Rate), and RDE (Relative Distance Error). The presented LC (Lobe Counting) method is capable of
splitting leukocyte nuclei into lobes. The experimental results illuminated that both methods can give expressive
performances. In addition, three advanced image processing techniques were proposed as weighted Sobel
operator, GDW (Gradient Direction Weight), and GBPD (Genetic-based Parameter Detector).
Background
Leukocytes, derived from bone marrow stem cells, are
the first line of defense of the immune system. Neutro-
phils, basophils, and eosinophils are called granulocytes
because they have granules in their cytoplasm. The
other two leukocyte categories, lymphocytes and mono-
cytes, belong to the mononuclear cell group. This
means their nucleus is a single piece. These cells are
colorless, but they can be colored with special stains to
make them visible under the microscope.
The characteristics of the five leukocyte categories are
described as follows. Figure 1 shows the micrographic
images of the five different leukocytes [1,2].
Neutrophil
This granulocyte has very tiny stained granules with low
visibility. The nucleus is frequently multi-lobed with
lobes connected by thin strands of nuclear material.

These cells are capable of phagocytizing foreign cells,
toxins, and viruses. This type of cell is the most com-
monly found, accounting for 50-70% of all leukocytes. If
the count exceeds this amount, it is usually caused by
an acute infection such as appendicitis, smallpox, or
rheumatic fever. If the count is significantly below nor-
mal levels, it may be attributed to a viral infection such
as influenza, hepatitis, or rubella.
Eosinophils
This granulocyte has large granules that are acidophilic
and appear pink (or red) after staining. The nucleus
often has two lobes connected by a band of nuclear
material. The granules contain digestive enzymes that
are particularly effective against parasitic worms in their
larval form. These cells also phagocytize antigen-
antibody complexes. Less than 5% of leukocytes are
Eosinophils. The increased amount beyond that may be
due to parasitic diseases, bronchial asthma, or hay fever.
Eosinopenia may occur when the human body is
severely stressed.
Basophil
The basophilic granules in this cell are large, stained
deep blue to purple, and are often so numerous that
they mask the nucleus. These granules contain hista-
mines (causing vasodilation) and heparin (anticoagu-
lant). They represent less than 1% of all leukocytes.
If the count shows an abnormally high number of these
cells, hemolytic anemia or chicken pox may be the
cause.
Lymphocyte
The lymphocyte is an agranular cell with a very clear
cytoplasm that is pale blue when stained. This cell is
much smaller than the three previous granulocytes that
are all about the same size. The nucleus of the lympho-
cyte is stained dark purple and almost fills the cell leaving
a very thin rim of cytoplasm. The T-lymphocytes fight
against virus infecting cells and tumor cells. The B-
lymphocytes, which make up 25-35% of leukocytes,
produce antibodies. When there is an overexpression of B-
lymphocytes, there may be an infectious mononucleosis or

a chronic infection. AIDS patients are required to keep a
careful watch on their T-cell level, an indicator of the
AIDS virus’ activity.
Monocyte
Agranular in shape, this cell type is the largest among
the leukocytes. The nucleus is most often “U” or kidney
bean shaped and the cytoplasm is abundant and light
blue (bluer than the micrograph illustrates). These cells
leave the blood stream (diapedesis) to become macro-
phages. As a monocyte or macrophage, these cells are
phagocytic and defend the body against viruses and bac-
teria. 3% to 9% of leukocytes are composed of this type
of cells. People suffering from malaria, endocarditis,
typhoid fever, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever will
exhibit an increase the number of monocytes.
High leukocyte counts may be due to inflammation,
an immune response, or blood diseases. [3,4]
• An increased percentage of neutrophils may result
from:
acute infection, eclampsia, gout, myelocytic leuke-
mia, rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic fever, acute
stress, thyroiditis, or trauma.
• Decreased percentage of neutrophils could be caused by:
aplastic anemia, chemotherapy, influenza, widespread
bacterial infection, or radiation therapy or exposure.
• Increasing percentage of lymphocytes may be attrib-
uted to:
chronic bacterial infection, infectious hepatitis, infec-
tious mononucleosis, lymphocytic leukemia, multiple
myeloma, infectious mononucleosis, mumps, measles,
or recovery from a bacterial infection.
• Decreased percentage of lymphocytes may be related to:
chemotherapy, HIV infection, leukemia, radiation
therapy or exposure, or sepsis.
• Increased monocytes could result from:
chronic inflammatory disease, parasitic infection,
tuberculosis, infectious mononucleosis, mumps, or
measles.
• Increased percentage of eosinophils may be caused by:
allergic reaction, cancer, parasitic infection, or Hodg-
kin’s disease.
• Basophils percentage reduction may be due to acute
allergic reaction.
Microscopic leukocyte analysis is very useful for iden-
tifying or diagnosing many types of diseases [4]. One
can recognize the five different leukocytes via their cyto-
plasmic granules, staining properties of the granules,
sizes and shapes of cells, the proportion of nuclear to
cytoplasmic material, and the type of nucleolar lobes.
Therefore, developing an automatic leukocyte recogni-
tion system is feasible via image processing and pattern
recognition techniques. It is essential to extract the leu-
kocyte image region from a blood smear image for an
automatic leukocyte recognition system. One of the pur-
poses of this paper is to develop an automatic leukocyte
nuclei image segmentation method.
A normal neutrophil granulocyte is characterized by
the number of nuclear lobes (segments) in the range of
two to five. Normally, 10% to 30% of segmented neu-
trophils have two lobes; the three-lobe type contributes
to 40% to 50%, and 10% to 20% are four-lobe type.
Five-lobe type constitutes of less than 5%. When the
number of segments is increased to six or more, the cell
is hypersegmented. Hypersegmentation is seen most fre-
quently in neutrophils but can also occur in eosinophils
and basophils. Hypersegmentation generally represents
aging of the cell in the circulation. Corticosteroids
usually reduce neutrophil diapedesis into tissues. As a
result, neutrophils remain longer in circulation and may
partially become hypersegmented. A so-called Neutro-
phil Right Shift (that is, the number of lobes increases),
occurs in the cases of leukemias, chronic nephritis, liver
diseases, cancer, sepsis, and vitamin B12 or folate defi-
ciency. Neutrophil hypersegmentation thus has clinically
been widely used as an indicator of B12 or folate defi-
ciency. There were many attempts made to quantify the
neutrophil right shift [5]. Hence, the other goal of this
paper is to develop the automatic method of counting
the number of lobes in a cell nucleus. The experimental
results show that the proposed methods resulted in
impressive segmentation accuracy.

this paper as well as some cell segmentation methods.
In this paper, we will compare their performances with
the performance of the method provided in this paper
by experiments.
Mathematical Morphology
Two basic morphological operations for image shape
recognition, dilation, and erosion are introduced in this
subsection [6]. Erosion can make the objects in a binary
image shrink or become thinner. Given an image I ⊆ Z2

operation ⊙ is defined as

A binary image contains only two colors: background
color and foreground color respectively, described by a
0-bit and a 1-bit. Dilation allows objects’ images to
expand, thus potentially filling in small holes and con-
necting disjointed objects. The dilation operation can be
defined as the following:

Cell Segmentation Methods
Four cell segmentation methods are reviewed: Bone
Marrow Leukocyte Segmentation (BMLS) method [7],
Nuclei Position Detection (NPD) method [8], Fuzzy-
based Cell Detection (FCD) method [9], and Color and
Active Contour based Detection (CACD) [10]. Their
performances will be compared to the segmentation
method proposed in this paper.
The BMLS method [7] was to analyze a set of leuko-
cyte-nucleus-based features using mathematical mor-
phology. It applies the opening operation [6] on an
image and increases the size of the structuring element
in order to diminish the objects on the image.
The NPD method was developed to automatically seg-
ment the cells from genome-wide RNAi (RNA interfer-
ence) screening images. The nuclei can be separated
from DNA channel by using a modified watershed
algorithm. The images of cells were then extracted by
modeling the interaction between the cells, and by com-
bining both gradient and region information in the
Actin and Rac channels. A new energy function was for-
mulated based on an interaction model for segmenting
tightly clustered cells with significant intensity variance
and specific phenotypes, and minimized by using a mul-
tiphase level set method. In NPD, Otsu’s threshold
method is first applied to determine a threshold Tc to
classify all the pixels into two classes. The distance
transform was employed to calculate the shortest dis-
tance between each pixel to the non-zero pixel. Finally,
the watershed transform was employed to segment the
contours of all objects in the image.
The FCD method [11] was to track neural stem cells
in a sequence of images. Users can interactively verify
and correct the crucial starting segmentation of the first
frame, and also inspect the final result while correcting
errors if necessary. All cells are classified into inactive,
active, dividing, and clustered cells. Different algorithms
are employed to deal with different cell categories.
A special backtracking step was used to automatically
correct some common errors that appear in the initial
forward tracking process. The fuzzy threshold method
was first applied to classify all the pixels of an image.
Two thresholds were calculated. All pixels with grey-
level intensity below the lower threshold were set to
0 and all pixels above the higher threshold were set to
1. The gray-level intensities of the remaining pixels,
whose gray-level intensities lie between the lower
threshold and the higher threshold, are linearly rescaled
to the range [0, 1]. Then the distance transformed is
applied to calculate the shortest distance of any one
pixel to the non-zero pixel. Finally, the maximum trans-
form and watershed transform will be applied to deter-
mine the contours of all objects in the image.
The CACD method [7] was to cut off the leukocytes
from a color blood smear image. In this method, Otsu’s
threshold method was used to determine a threshold on
the green channel of the image. Via the threshold, the
initial contours of nucleuses can be detected from the
image. Based on the initial contour, active contour
method was employed to find the precise boundaries of
cytoplasm.
Error Measure of Segmentation
In this paper, four segmentation error measures were used
to evaluate the performance of a segmentation method.
Over-segmentation rate (OR), Under- segmentation Rate
(UR), and Overall Error Rate (ER) are often applied to
evaluate the ability of a segmentation method in severing
the ROI (Region Of Interest) from an image [12]. Let Op
be the number of object pixels in the segmentation results
but actually not, UP be the number of pixels not in the
segmentation result but actually included, and DP be the
number of pixels in the segmentation result and actually
included. OR, UR and ER can be described as:

Results
The purpose of this section is to investigate the perfor-
mances of the LNS method in leukocyte nuclei segmen-
tation and the LC method in lobe counting by
experiments. In order to verify the adaptability of the
LNS method, two image sets are used as the test data.
The two image sets are obtained from different labora-
tories and different equipments. There are 29 images in
set 1 (provided by Prof. Meng-Hsiun Tsai, Dartpartment
of Information Systems, National Chung Hsing Univer-
stiy) and 41 images in set 2 (provided by Dr. Guo-Qing
Liu, Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Bio-
technology, China Medical University). Totally, there are
47 leukocytes on all the images in set 1 and 53 leuko-
cytes on all the images in set 2. These images were
taken with optic microscopes at about 800 to 1000
times magnification. The contours of the leukocyte
nuclei manually drawn by a biologist are served as the
ground truth. Four of the test images are randomly
selected to train the most suitable rs = 0.6, rG = 2.5, rt
= 0.8, rr = 0.7, t1 = 23, t2 = 352, t3 = 25, t4 = 830, t5 =
0.1, and t6 = 0.1 via GBPD, where the parameters used
are given to nr1

= 16, nr3
= 10, nr4
= 10, N
= 10, N’ = 10, and n1 = n2 = n3 = n4 = n5 = n6 = 40,
and the lobes in the test images were counted by the
biologist in advance. MAX_#EROSION is set to 20.
The first experiment is designed to explore the perfor-
mance of the LNS method and to compare with the per-
formances of the NPD, FCD, and CACD methods in
segmenting leukocyte nuclei out from a blood smear
image. The segmentation errors are shown in Figures 2,
3, 4, 5 and Tables 1 and 2. The experimental results
illustrate that the LNS method produces much better
UR, ER, and RDE than the NPD, FCD, and CACD
methods by using the images in sets 1 and 2 as the test
images.
The second experiment is designed to scrutinize the
performance of the LC method in splitting the leukocyte
nuclei into lobes. The LC method is used to detect
whether a leukocyte nucleus comprises more than
one lobe or not, and then to separate those seemed-
multi-lobe image of the nucleus into clear lobes. If the
area ratio R of the leukocyte nucleus to its MBR is less
than a threshold rA, the leukocyte nucleus is considered
to be the nucleus containing more than one lobe. The
R’s of 47 leukocyte nuclei to their MBRs is shown in
Figure 6, where the 47 leukocyte nuclei have to be split
further. The curve in Figure 6 displays that its R is
almost less than 0.7 for each leukocyte nuclei. There-
fore, in this experiment, rA is set to 0.7.
The LC method is used to split the leukocyte nuclei
into lobes with rA = 0.7. In this experiment, the biologi-
cal expert figures out 223 leukocyte nucleus lobes in the
29 test images. The leukocyte nuclei were split into
lobes and counted that there are 186 leukocyte nucleus
lobes in the 29 test images. The accuracy rate of

83.41% resulted from counting the leukocyte nucleus
lobes on the blood smear images by the LC method.
Discussion
The first experimental results show that the LNS
method is inferior to the NPD and FCD methods but
worse than the CACD method in OR by using the
images in set 1 as test data. With set 2 as test data, the
LNS method performed better OR than the CACD
method but worse than the FCD method, and as excel-
lently as the NPD method. The results of this experi-
ment revealed that the LNS method resulted in much
better UR, ER, and RDE and is much less sensitive to
the variation of images.
In the primary stage of a continued “right shift”
(increasing the number of lobes), a leukocyte nucleus
was twisted and slightly indented, such as the regions
indicated by the black dashes in Figure 7. The experi-
mental results show that LC method can provide a good
lobe split for most leukocyte nuclei, except the leukocyte
nuclei with a slight indentation.
Conclusions
Insensitive to the variance of images, the LNS method
functioned well to isolate the leukocyte nuclei from a
blood smear image with much better UR, ER, and RDE.
The presented LC method is capable of splitting leukocyte
nuclei into lobes. The experimental results illuminated
that both methods can give expressive performances. In
addition, three advanced image processing techniques
were proposed as weighted Sobel operator, GDW, and
GBPD. In a weighted Sobel operator, a user can give the
most suitable rs to satisfy his requirement. A bigger rs is
required for the user to accentuate the objects with a
more definite contour. To highlight the objects with an
indistinct contour, a smaller rs has to be assigned. GDW
can not only enhance the object’s contour, but also sup-
press the noise’s contour. GBPD was used to determine
the optimal parameters that were used in LNS method.
Methods
In this study, a Leukocyte Nuclei Segmentation (LNS)
method was proposed to automatically extract the leukocyte

nuclei region from a blood smear image. The LNS method
consists of two stages: Object Contour Detection and Leu-
kocyte Nuclei Segmentation. A blood smear image is the
image mixture of possible leukocytes, erythrocyte cells, pla-
telets, leukocyte nuclei, and noise. The goal of the object
contour detection stage is to locate all the objects on the
image. At the leukocyte nuclei segmentation stage, leuko-
cyte nucleus objects were then filtered out based on the
gray-level intensities and the sizes of the objects obtained at
the object contour detection stage.
Object Contour Detection
During the object contour detection stage, there are six
approaches: preprocessing, weighted Sobel operator, gra-
dient direction weight enhancer, candidate contour pixel
detecting, thinning and spur trimming, and region
combination. The flowchart of LNS method is shown in
Figure 8; this section will introduce each of these
approaches in detail.
Preprocessing
The blood smear may be stained by different color dyes.
To avoid being influenced by dye color, all blood smear
images were first transformed into gray-level. In order
to diminish the variation of images, the pixels’ gray-level
intensities of a blood smear image I0 were then
stretched to the full 0 to 255 range. Let I0(x, y) (resp. Ip
(x, y)) be the pixel located at the coordinates (x, y) on
I0 (resp. Ip), and max as well as min the maximal and
the minimal gray-level intensities of all the pixels in I0,
respectively. I0 is then transformed into Ip by

to reduce the varia-
tion among all different images.
Weighted Sobel Operator
An edge generally corresponds to a set of strong illumi-
nation gradients. Sobel operator [14] is one of the sim-
plest and most effective gradient computation methods.
LNS method will employ Sobel operator to calculate the
gradients of the pixels in Ip. Two 3×3 convolution
masks shown in Figure 9 are employed in Sobel opera-
tor. We call W(x, y) a corresponding window of Ip(x, y)
where Ip(x, y) is located at the center of W(x, y) and
W(x, y) consists of m×m pixels. Ip(x ± x’, y ± y’) are
the pixels in W(x, y) for 0

Different users prefer either to highlight the gradients
of the pixels with high gradients, or to enhance the gra-
dients of the pixels with low gradients. To solve these
problem caused by human preference, a Weighted Sobel
Operator (WSO) was then proposed by the authors. Let
gM and gm be the maximal and minimal ones of all the
pixel gradients in Ip. This weighted sobel operator

to the gray-
level intensity of the pixel Ig(x, y) located at the coordi-
nates (x, y) in Ig, where rs is a given constant. Hence, Ig
can be a gray-level image regarding the gradients of the
pixels in Ip.
Given a big rs (i.e. rs>1), WSO will enhance the pixel
with a high gradient but suppress the pixel with low
gradient obtained by Sobel operator. Contrarily, when
given a small rs (i.e. rs<1), it will inhibit the pixel with
high gradient but highlight the pixel with low gradient
computed by Sobel operator. The gradients obtained by
the weighted Sobel operator with different rs are shown
in Figure 10. A generic algorithm was then used to
decide the optimal value of rs later.
Gradient Direction Weight Enhancer
Given a smaller rs, the weighted Sobel operator can
make the object contour more obvious but also raising
the gradient of noise. A GDW (Gradient Direction
Weight) Enhancer was proposed in this paper to lower
the gradient of noise contour and enhance the gradient
of object contour. The gradient directions of the pixels
near the object contour are usually almost perpendicular
to the direction of the object contour. In microscopic
viewpoints, a small object contour segment is close to
one straight line. For example in Figure 11(a), the line L
is an object contour segment and the arrows are the
gradient directions of the pixels near the object contour
segment. Moreover, these gradient directions near a
noise contour are shown in Figure 11(b). Based on this

that one object contour segment L passes through Ip(x,

The GDW enhancer first estimates θL, which is supposed
to be close to one of 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°. Let WG be a
corresponding window of Ip(x, y) composed of mG×mG

and the GDW of
Ip(x, y) as |sin(θL-θg)|.
As |θL-θg| is closer to 90° and Ig(x, y) is bigger, the
probability of I0(x, y) located at the object contour is
higher. Therefore, with the GDW enhancer,
I x yg L g
rG( , ) sin| |( - )  can be assigned to the gray-
level intensity of IG(x, y) for generating a new gray-level
image IG, where rG is a given constant. The optimal
constant rG will be decided by a genetic algorithm. The
images before and after the GDW enhancer processing
are shown in Figure 13.
Candidate Contour Pixel Detecting
The gray-level intensity of IG(x, y) represents the possi-
bility of I0(x, y) to be an object contour pixel. To suc-
cessfully cut off objects from I0 following GDW
enhancer approach processing, given an adaptive thresh-
old to isolate the possible object contour pixels is a pre-
requisite. Given a bigger threshold, higher contrast
edges may be detected but some desired edges with low
contrast may be overlooked. On the contrary, lower

old, but more noise edges may probably be collected
simultaneously. One of the commonly used threshold
decision making methods, Otsu’s method [15], is thus
utilized in LNS method to specify the threshold Th.
Otsu’s method exhaustively searches for the threshold t*
that minimizes the within-class variance, defined as a
weighted sum of variances of two classes:

class separated by a threshold t and i
2 the variance of
pixels’ gray-level intensities in the i-th classes.
In LNS method, each pixel IG(x, y) in IG was swept to
generate a binary image Ib. The threshold t* was then
applied to obtain an appropriate threshold t*×rt for bet-
ter candidate object contour extraction. The optimal rt
couldbe obtained by a genetic algorithm which will be
introduced later in this paper. If IG(x, y) is greater than
or equal to t*×rt, then 1 was assigned to Ib(x, y); other-
wise, a value of 0 would be assigned. The pixel Ib(x, y)
with 1-bit is called a candidate object contour pixel.
One IG and its corresponding Ib are demonstrated in
Figure 14.
Thinning and Spur Trimming
Noises in an image or the exquisite vein, and the pixels
at the vicinity of object contour may cause false edges.
The expected thickness of an object contour would be
one-pixel. In this paper, the Hit-and-Miss Transform-
based Skeletonization (HMTS) algorithm [6] is used to
reduce the object contour in the thickness of one pixel.
The eliminated candidate edge pixels were named as
redundant-edge pixels and the remaining candidate edge
pixels as true-edge pixels by the authors.
Thereafter, the region detecting approach takes the
HMTS algorithm [12,14] to reduce the object contour
thickness in one pixel. Let each pixel Ib(x, y) in Ib corre-
spond to a window Wt(x, y), where Wt(x, y) consists of
3×3 pixels and Ib(x, y) is the central pixel of Wt(x, y).
Wt(x, y) was compared with each of the eight structur-
ing elements in HMTS algorithm shown in Figure 15,
where the gray pixels stand for the don’t-care pixels (A
don’t-care pixel may be a 1-bit pixel or a 0-bit pixel).
Wt(x, y) is matched if the positions and values of 1- and
0-bits on one structuring element are completely the
same as those on Wt(x, y), regardless of don’t-care pix-
els. When Wt(x, y) is matched, Ib(x, y) is changed into
0. This procedure was repeated until no more thinning
needs to be performed in this algorithm. The HMTS
algorithm has been performed to cut off the redundant-
edge pixels, resulting in single-pixel edge thickness. The
result after running the thinning operation is shown on
Figure 16(b).
After being processed by HMTS method, some small
spurs may appear on the skeleton, which are not the
desired edges. Therefore, a trimming spur algorithm is
required to remove the spurs. The procedure of the
trimming spur algorithm [13] is exactly the same as that
of above thinning algorithm except for the eight struc-
turing elements in Figure 15, which are replaced by
those in Figure 17. The result obtained by the trimming
spur algorithm on the image in Figure 16(b) is shown in
Figure 16(c). Let Ie be the binary contour image, which
has been processed by the trimming spur algorithm.

Region Combination
Since the cytoplasm and nuclei of leukocytes are fre-
quently uneven, a nucleus may be segmented into sev-
eral small regions after the previous image processing.
In addition, some noises may still exist on the blood
smear image. Therefore, some regions in Ie must be
combined into one or be removed. Let B and B’ be two
different regions on Ip, the contours of which are
marked on Ie, where B’ is adjoining to B and B’ has the
minimal gray-level intensity difference from B.
Let A and A’ be the numbers of pixels in B and B’
respectively, and C and C’ be the average gray-level
intensities of all the pixels in B and in B’, respectively.
As one of the following criteria is satisfied, B can be
combined to B’:
1) A ≤ t1;
2) A ≥ t2, |C - C’| ≤ t3, and B is located at the image
boundary of Ip (a part of B is not in I0);
3) A ≥ t4, |C - C’| ≤ t3, and B is not located at the
image boundary of Ip,
where t1, t2, ..., t4 are four given thresholds. The
result after combining the segmented regions in Figure
18(a) is shown in Figure 18(b).
Leukocyte Nuclei Segmentation
After the regions combination, every closed curve in Ie
represents an object. There may be many kinds of
objects, like erythrocytes, the cytoplasts and nuclei of
leukocyte, platelets, and noise in a blood smear image.
This stage is intended to filter out the objects of leuko-
cyte nuclei from Ie. The leukocyte nucleus is usually
darker than the other blood cell’s. The cytoplasts of
basophil and lymphocyte are much darker than those of
the erythrocyte cells, and the cytoplasts of other leuko-
cytes are brighter or a little darker than those of the ery-
throcytes. The area of platelets is much smaller than
that of the lymphocyte nuclei. Based on these properties,
the leukocyte nuclei can be filtered out.
Let Cave be the average gray-level intensity of all the
pixels in all the objects indicated by Ie. Since the leuko-
cyte nuclei is darker than others, if the average gray-
level intensity of an object is smaller than or equal to T
= Cave×rr, then this object is regarded as a leukocyte
nuclei, where rr is a given constant. Through the above
processing, the filtered-out leukocyte nuclei for rr = 0.7
is shown in Figure 19(a). This paper will use a genetic
algorithm to obtain the optimal rr. The textures of leu-
kocyte cytoplasts and nuclei are often uneven. For seg-
menting the leukocyte nuclei more accurately, this stage

refines the contours on Ie. If a pixel inside a leukocyte
nuclei contour in Ie with gray-level intensity larger than
Cave, then this pixel is assigned to a non-leukocyte
nuclei pixel. If a pixel is outside the leukocyte nuclei
contours and the minimal distance between the pixel
and the contour indicated in Ie is less than 5 pixels and
its gray-level intensity smaller than or equal to T, the
pixel is considered a leukocyte nuclei pixel.
Some objects in Ie may be platelets or noise, which are
generally smaller than the lobes of leukocyte nucleus;
the region with a large area in Ie is always a white blood
cell or consists of several erythrocytes overlapping
together. According to this property, the segmented
objects were sorted according to their sizes. Let Am be
the area of the median object in size. Sized less than
t5×Am, the object was removed by the LNS method.
The results after refining the contours on the image in
Figure 19(a) are shown in Figure 19(b); the results after
removing the small objects are shown in Figure 19(c);
Figure 19(d) is the segmented contours.
A leukocyte nucleus probably consists of several
nuclei. If the contours of two nuclei are very close, both
nuclei are considered the same leukocyte nuclei. As the
sizes of two objects are less than Am and the distance of

Lobe Counting
The shape of the leukocyte nucleus is one of the most
important features in determining the type of the leuko-
cyte nucleus. The number of lobes can be used to
describe the phenomenon of neutrophil right shift. In
this section, Lobe Counting (LC) method is presented to
count the number of lobes in a leukocyte nucleus indi-
cated in Ie.
A leukocyte nucleus can be completely encircled by a
Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR), shown as Figures
20(c) and 14(d). While the contour of the leukocyte
nucleus is very crooked and uneven, the ratio R of
leukocyte nucleus area to its MBR’s is small. If R is less
than a threshold rA, the nucleus is considered to com-
prise more than one lobe and their lobes need cutting
off, i.e. the nucleus in Figure 20(c); otherwise, the nucleus
is considered to contain only one lobe, and it is unneces-
sary to split the nucleus as shown in Figure 20(d).

A junction between two lobes in a leukocyte nucleus
is usually at the contour crooked extremely or at the
narrow part of leukocyte nucleus, shown in Figure 20(a).
Erosion and dilation operations [6] were applied in the
LC method to separate the lobes. Let obj be a nucleus
which consists of two parameters, the nucleus of object
obj and obj.#iteration. With obj.#iteration, the number
of iterations ascends to execute erosion then dilation
operation. MAX_#EROSION is the given maximal
number of iterations in eroded obj. Algorithm Obj_cut
(obj) functions to cut off the lobes from obj with the
structuring element in Figure 21 for erosion and dilation
operations.
In an Obj_cut(obj), after executing erosion operation
on object obj, obj may disappear, not be split into some
sub-objects, or be split into some sub-objects. Lines 3
and 4 handle the case where obj will disappear in the
next erosion operation. Lines (5) to (7) deal with the obj
that is not split into some sub-objects. If obj is cut into
some sub-objects, each sub-object will be split continu-
ally. Lines (8) to (12) perform it.
Figure 22(b) is the contour of a leukocyte nucleus
detected by the LNS method from the image in
Figure 22(a). The R = 0.56 of the object obj indicated
by a arrow in Figure 22(b) is less than rA (in this exam-
ple, rA is set to 0.7), so obj needs splitting. Figure 22(c)
shows the obj. Until the fifth run in eroding obj, obj is
split into two sub-objects obj1 and obj2, displayed in
Figure 22(d). Then, obj1 is repeatedly split. After two
eroding runs, obj1 is separated into two objects obj11
and obj12, demonstrated in Figure 22(e). Obj_cut() con-
tinually severs obj11. Figure 22(f) is the obj11 after one
eroding run. After two eroding runs, obj11 will disap-
pear. Hence, the algorithm runs dilation operation once
on obj11 in Figure 22(f); Figure 22(g) is the result of this
run. Next, Obj_cut() tries to split obj12. Since obj12 will
disappear after executing one erosion operation, no ero-
sion and no dilation will be executed on obj12. After-
ward, Obj_cut() goes to erode obj2. obj2 vanishes after
running erosion twice on obj2. Figure 22(h) is the obj2
after applying erosion operation once to obj2. Therefore,
Obj_cut() runs dilation operation once on obj2; Figure
22(i) shows the final result of running Obj_cut() on ori-
ginal obj.
After executing Obj_cut(obj), some pixels in the origi-
nal obj may not appear in the divided objects. Each of
the unclassified pixels will be assigned to one of the
divided objects. The LC method will compute the dis-
tance between every unclassified pixel p and each con-
tour pixel in the divided objects and assigns p to the
divided object, one of whose contour pixels is closest to
p. Afterwards, Figure 22(i) is converted into Figure 22(j).
Figure 22(k) is the original image drawn on the divided
object contours.

Genetic-Based Parameter Detector (GBPD)
The performance of the LNS method is deeply affected
by the values of rs, rG, rt, rr, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, and t6. In
this paper, a genetic-based parameter detector (GBPD)
is employed to determine the most suitable values of rs,
rG, rt, rr, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, and t6.
A genetic algorithm (GA) [16] is a heuristic optimiza-
tion method in which the set of possible solutions is
considered a population of individuals. The adaptation
degree of an individual to its environment is specified
by its fitness. The coordinate of an individual in the
search space is represented by a chromosome. A gene is
a subsection of a chromosome that encodes the value of
a single parameter being optimized. A genetic algorithm
derives from evolutionary theory, so that, given a certain
population, only the individuals adapting well to their
environment can survive and transmit their characteris-
tics to their descendants. Basically, a genetic algorithm
consists of three major operations: selection, crossover,
and mutation. Selection evaluates all individuals and
only those most adaptable to their environment can sur-
vive. Crossover recombines the genetic material of two
individuals to form new combinations with the potential
for a better performance. Mutation induces changes in a

cient population diversity during the optimization
process.
GBPD utilizes a binary string, concatenated by ten
binary substrings ss, sG, st, sr, s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, and s6,
respectively comprised of nrs
, nrG
, nrt
, nrr

n3, n4, n5, and n6 binary bits, to represent a chromo-
some Ch. ss, sG, st, sr, s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, and s6 are desig-
nated to describe the corresponding values of rs, rG, rt,
rr, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, and t6. For each chromosome Ch, rs,
rG, rt, rr, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, and t6 are encoded as

GBPD applies the accumulated historic data to train
the most appropriate rs, rG, rt, rr, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, and t6
via a genetic algorithm. The manually drawn leukocyte
nuclei contours are considered a collection of ground
truths. GBPD uses the average relative foreground area
error (RAE) as the measure of fitness of a chromosome
based on the rs, rG, rt, rr, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, and t6 encoded
by the chromosome.
GBPD first randomly generates N chromosomes, each
consisting of nrs
, nrG
, nrt
, nrr
, n1, n2, n3, n4, n5,
and n6 binary bits. To evolve the best solution, the
genetic algorithm repeatedly executes mutation, cross-
over, and selection operations until the relative fitness
of the reserved chromosomes are similar.
In mutation operation, for each of the N reserved
chromosomes, GBPD uses a random number generator
to specify one bit b for each of ss, sG, st, sr, s1, s2, s3, s4,
s5, and s6. b is then replaced by ¬b to generate a new
chromosome, where ¬ signifies the operator “NOT.”
In crossover operation, similarly a random number
generator is used to designate N’ pairs of chromosomes
from the N reserved chromosomes. Let Ch[i..j] be the
substring consisting of the ith
to jth
bits in Ch, S = {0,

In selection operation, N optimal chromosomes are
selected from the N chromosomes reserved in the pre-
vious iteration and N as well as 2×N’ chromosomes cre-
ated in the mutation and crossover operations according
to their fitness. Three major operations (mutation,
crossover, and selection) need to be continuously per-
formed until the related fitness of the reserved N chro-
mosomes is very close or the number of iterations is
equal to the specified maximum number of generations.
