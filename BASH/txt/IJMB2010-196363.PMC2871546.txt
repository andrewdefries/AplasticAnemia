An antifungal protein isolated from Escherichia coli BL21 (PPEBL21) and predicted to be alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was
subjected to biological characterization. The PPEBL21, indeed, demonstrated propionaldehyde-speciﬁc ADH activity. The Km and
Vmax of PPEBL21 were found to be 644.8 μM and 1.2 U/mg, respectively. In-gel activity assay also showed that PPEBL21 was a
propionaldehyde-speciﬁc ADH. The pI of PPEBL21 was observed to be 7.8. PPEBL21 was found to be stable up to a temperature of
40◦
C with optimum activity at pH 7.5. The decrease in pH decreased the activity of PPEBL21. These results suggested that PPEBL21
having alcohol dehydrogenase activity and stability at signiﬁcantly high temperature might be an important lead antifungal
molecule. Experiments were performed to identify the possible target of PPEBL21 in the pathogen A. fumigatus. Results revealed
that PPEBL21 inhibited completely the expression of a 16 kDa protein in A. fumigatus. The 16 kDa protein of A. fumigatus targeted
by PPEBL21 was identiﬁed as a hypothetical protein by peptide mass ﬁngerprinting. It is thus hypothesized that a 16 kDa factor is
essentially required by A. fumigatus for survival and its impaired synthesis due to treatment with PPEBL21 may lead to the death
of pathogen.
1. Introduction
The need for developing new, safe and more eﬀective
antifungal drugs has been a major challenge today, especially
with alarming increase in the incidence of opportunistic
life-threatening fungal infections due to variety of factors
including indiscriminate use of antibiotics, immunosuppres-
sive therapies, blood transfusions, organ transplantation,
and underlying diseases such as aplastic anemia, AIDS,
chronic granulomatous disease, and Job’s syndrome [1]. The
history of new drug discovery processes has shown that novel
skeletons with antimycotic properties have, in the majority of
cases, come from natural sources [2]. There have been eﬀorts
which involved the screening of plants and microorganisms
for antimycotic properties [3–5]. However, the progress on
the search for new, broad-spectrum antifungal compounds
with greater potency has been very slow [6]. One reason for
the slow progress compared to antibacterials has been that,
like mammalian cells, fungi are also eukaryotes and therefore
agents that inhibit protein, RNA, or DNA biosynthesis in
fungi have a greater potential for toxicity to the host as
well [7]. Another reason has been that, until recently, the
incidence of life threatening fungal infections was perceived
as being too low to warrant aggressive research aiming at
developing ideal antifungal formulations [8].
Under a research programme on new drug development,
we evaluated a panel of bacteria for antimycotic potential [9].
It was observed that Escherichia coli strain BL21 possessed
antifungal properties and its activity was associated with
a 39.30 kDa protein synthesized by E. coli BL21 [10]. The
primary amino acid structure of 39.30 kDa protein of E. coli
BL21 (PPEBL21) did not resemble that of antifungal proteins
described so far and therefore, it could be an important
lead from diﬀerent class of molecules. The present study was
undertaken to characterize the PPEBL21 partially. Attempts
were also made to identify the target(s) of PPEBL21 in
A. fumigatus that might play a role in the survival of the
pathogen.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Bacterial Strain. Escherichia coli BL21 (MTCCB 1678)
was procured from Institute of Microbial Technology,
Chandigarh (India). The E. coli was cultured in LB Broth for
3 days at 37◦
C in a shaker incubator. The cells were counted
by the turbidity method and used for performing various
experiments.
2.2. Pathogens. Pathogenic strains of A. fumigatus were
obtained from Microbiology Department of Vallabhbhai
Patel Chest Institute, Delhi, India and cultured in Sabouraud
dextrose agar for 4 days. The plates were used as the source
of spores for performing experiments.
2.3. Puriﬁcation of PPEBL21. An activity guided puriﬁcation
of antifungal molecule from E. coli lysate was performed.
The lysate prepared from BL21 strain of E. coli was sub-
jected to fractionation by ion exchange chromatography
[9]. The proteins recovered in an active ion exchange
chromatographic fraction (F III) were subfractionated by
gel ﬁltration. An amount of 3.0 mg of F III proteins was
applied onto a Sephadex G 100 column (1.5 × 75.0 cm)
and eluted with 10 mM Tris-HCl buﬀer (pH 7.5) at a ﬂow
rate of 0.5 ml min−1 to obtain ﬁve subfractions (SF 1 to
SF 5). The active SF 3 was further examined for purity by
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and HPLC using
C8 column. The puriﬁed active protein of E. coli (PPEBL21)
was subjected to detailed biological characterization.
2.4. Elucidation of Isoelectric Point of PPEBL21. The iso-
electric point (pI) of PPEBL21 was determined by using
modiﬁed method described by Towbin et al. [11]. Prior to
isoelectric focusing, the protein sample was prepared by 2D
clean up kit (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by
suppliers. An amount of 100 μg of protein was reconstituted
in 50 μl of IEF-loading buﬀer (8 mM urea, 50 mM DTT, 2%
Triton X-100, and 1.2% ampholyte pH 3–10). IPG strips
were rehydrated with sample overnight and subjected to ﬁrst-
dimension electrophoresis on IEF cell (BioRad, CA, USA) by
using standard program recommended by the manufacturer.
Second-dimension electrophoresis was done on 12.5% SDS-
PAGE in Mini Protean assembly (BioRad, CA, USA). The gel
was silver stained for further analysis.
2.5. Biochemical Analysis of PPEBL21. The analysis of N-
Terminal amino acid sequence and peptide mass ﬁnger-
printing revealed that the PPEBL21 could be an alcohol
dehydrogenase (ADH) [10]. Therefore, PPEBL21 in native
form was studied for its enzymatic properties.
2.5.1. ADH Activity. An amount of 10 μg of PPEBL21 was
dissolved in 100 μl of sodium pyrophosphate buﬀer, pH
7.5. The protein solution in microwell of a plate was
incubated with 10 mM of ADH-speciﬁc aldehydes (such
as acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, formaldehyde, and ben-
zaldehyde all from M/s Sigma Chemical Company, USA) and
25 mM NADH solution. The wells were examined for the
development of colour, and the OD at 340 nm of the solution
was measured from 1 to 20 minutes using a microwell plate
reader (Spectra Max Plus, Molecular Devices, USA). The OD
was plotted against time to determine the enzyme activity.
2.5.2. In-Gel ADH Activity Assay. The in-gel enzyme activity
of PPEBL21 was determined by the method of Birken
and Pisano [12]. PPEBL21 was run on 12.5% native gel
and treated with staining mixture which was consisted
of 50 ml of 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate buﬀer pH 7.5,
1.0 ml of 10 mg/ml NADH (Sigma Chemical Company,
USA) solution, 50 ml of 100.0 mM of aldehyde (acetaldehyde,
propionaldehyde, formaldehyde or benzaldehyde), 1.0 ml of
10 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma Chemical Company,
USA), and 0.4 ml of 50 mg/ml of phenazine methosulfate
(Sigma Chemical Company, USA) solution. Gel was incu-
bated in staining solution at 37◦
C until clear zone of activity
was optimally developed. The reaction was stopped by
adding water to the gel. The gel was further washed with
water three times and stored in 7% acetic acid.
2.5.3. Enzyme Kinetics. The ADH enzyme kinetics of
PPEBL21 was studied using the basic method of Vallee
and Hoch [13]. ADH activity was assayed in 96 well plates
containing 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate buﬀer pH 7.5,
25 mM NADH, and 10.0 μg of PPEBL21. The standard ADH
was used in control wells. The reaction was started by the
addition of diﬀerent concentrations of propionaldehyde as
the enzyme substrate. The rate of reaction was monitored
using a microwell plate reader (Spectra Max Plus, Molecular
Devices, USA) in kinetic mode. Speciﬁc activities were
expressed as the rate of NAD formed/min/mg protein. Vmax
and Km of PPEBL21 were calculated by using software
(Sigma Plot 8.0).
2.6. Stability of PPEBL21. The stability of protein at diﬀerent
temperatures ranging from 4 to 100◦
C was determined by
incubating PPEBL21 in 10 mM Tris-HCl buﬀer (pH 7.5) for
20 minutes. The solution of protein was cooled to 4◦
C and
examined for anti-Aspergillus activity by percentage spore
germination inhibition (PSGI) assay [4]. The stability of
PPEBL21 under acidic and alkaline conditions was tested
by using citrate phosphate buﬀer (pH 2.5 to 8.0) and Tris-
HCl buﬀer (pH 7.5 to 10.5). PPEBL21 was incubated in
each buﬀer at various pHs at 4◦
C for 20 minutes. The anti-
Aspergillus activity was assayed as per the method of Rajesh
and Sharma [4] after the pH of each PPEBL21 solution was
readjusted to 7.5.
2.7. Identiﬁcation of Gene Products/Protein Target. The exper-
iments were carried out to identify the gene product(s) of A.
fumigatus targeted by the active molecule obtained from E.
coli. The pathogenic A. fumigatus was cultured in the absence
or presence of sublethal doses of the molecule. The proteins
were isolated and separated on SDS gels for comparison of
protein proﬁle to identify the gene product aﬀected by the
molecule.
International Journal of Microbiology 3
2.7.1. Treatment of Pathogen with PPEBL21. The analysis of
A. fumigatus proteins expressed diﬀerentially in untreated or
that treated with antifungal protein PPEBL21 was carried out
to identify gene products targeted by PPEBL21 as per the
method described by Chhillar et al. [14]. The A. fumigatus
was cultured in asparagine broth, a synthetic medium, which
was prepared by dissolving asparagine (7.0 gm), ammo-
nium chloride (7.0 gm), potassium dihydrogen phosphate
(1.31 gm), ferric chloride (0.30 gm), dextrose (10.00 gm),
sodium citrate (0.90 gm), and glycerol (25.0 ml) in 1000 ml
of distilled water. The medium was dispensed into 250 ml
ﬂasks and sterilized at 10 psi for 15 minutes. The ﬂasks were
divided into two sets, the test and control. Sublethal doses of
PPEBL21 were added to test set of the ﬂasks. In the control
set, only solvent was added. The ﬂasks of both sets were
inoculated with spores of A. fumigatus and incubated at 37◦
C
in a BOD incubator for 36 hours.
2.7.2. Protein Extraction. The cultures of treated and
untreated ﬂasks were harvested after 36 hours. The medium
was removed and mycelial mat was inactivated by treating
with 5% formaldehyde overnight. The fungal mat was dried
at 37◦
C and lyophilized. It was crushed in mortar pestle to
obtain ﬁne powder. The fungal powder was defatted with
diethylether with several changes until it became colorless.
The suspension was then ﬁltered through Whatman ﬁlter
paper no. 1. It was then dried and stored in airtight bottles
at −20◦
C for further use. The defatted fungal materials were
extracted with 1 : 20 (w/v) 0.05 M ammonium bicarbonate
buﬀer, pH 8.0 by continuous stirring for 24 hours [15].
The suspension was centrifuged at 16,500 g for 30 minutes
at 4◦
C. The supernatant was dialyzed against water for 24
hours using membrane of 10 kDa cutoﬀ. The extracts were
again centrifuged and then passed through a Millipore ﬁlter
membrane (0.45 μm). The ﬁltrates of control and treated
pathogens were lyophilized and labeled properly before
storage at −70◦
C. The proteins obtained from diﬀerent
cultures were estimated by BCA method and resolved by
SDS-PAGE for comparison. The proﬁle of protein bands of
the mycelial proteins obtained from treated and untreated
A. fumigatus were compared to identify the gene product(s)
targeted by PPEBL21.
2.7.3. Peptide Mass Fingerprinting by MALDI TOF MS. The
protein band of A. fumigatus targeted by PPEBL21 was
sliced out and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin.
The proteolytic fragments separated on a microbore HPLC
column were subsequently analyzed by LCMS as described by
Gao et al. [16]. The Mascot algorithm was then employed to
identify the peptide matches in candidate proteins available
in MSDB database.

was propionaldehyde-speciﬁc.
3.1. Elucidation of Isoelectric Point. The PPEBL21 was sub-
jected to isoelectric focusing using IPG strips of 3–10 pH
range to determine the isoelectric point. The results of
two-dimensional electrophoresis demonstrated the pI of
PPEBL21 to be 7.8.
3.2. Biochemical Properties
3.2.1. ADH Activity. PPEBL21 was examined for ADH
activity using four diﬀerent aldehydes as substrate. It was
observed that PPEBL21 reduced propionaldehyde preferen-
tially (Figure 1). The addition of propionaldehyde to the
reaction mixture containing PPEBL21 resulted in formation
of the yellowish product. The rate of product formation
increased with increase in incubation period and reaction
was completed within 13 minutes. The PPEBL21 did not
show enzyme activity with other aldehydes as there was no
product formation up to 20 minutes.
3.2.2. In-Gel ADH Activity. PPEBL21 was further examined
for in-gel ADH activity using four diﬀerent aldehydes as
substrate. Enzyme activity was detected by treating the gel
with staining mixture containing 100 mM of aldehydes. A
colourless smear was observed in-gels incubated with solu-
tion containing propionaldehyde as substrate (Figure 2). The
gels which were treated with acetaldehyde, formaldehyde or
benzaldehyde as substrate did not show any presence of ADH
activity. The standard ADH (from Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
procured from Sigma, USA, was used as positive control.
The standard ADH also reduced the propionaldehyde and
developed a colourless smear in the gel on incubation with
staining mixture (Figure 2). Thus, the results reconﬁrmed
that PPEBL21 had propionaldehyde-speciﬁc ADH activity.
3.2.3. Enzyme Kinetics. The reduction of propionaldehyde
by PPEBL21 in the presence of NADH was investigated at
diﬀerent substrate concentrations. The kinetic properties of

the puriﬁed PPEBL21 were determined using a software,
namely, Sigma plot 8.0. Michaelis-Menten analysis indicated
the dependence of product formation rate on substrate
concentration. The Km and Vmax values of PPEBL21 were
estimated to be 644.8 μM and 1.2 U/mg, respectively, whereas
standard ADH reduced propionaldehyde at faster rate and its
Km was 481.9 μM and Vmax was 1.3 U/mg (Figure 3).
3.3. Stability of PPEBL21. The anti-Aspergillus activity of
PPEBL21 after exposure to various temperatures and pH
conditions was determined. The PPEBL21 was found to
withstand the temperature of 40◦
C. The activity of PPEBL21
decreased with increasing temperature and protein was
completely inactivated by heating at 80◦
C for 20 minutes
in 10 mM Tris-HCl buﬀer at pH 7.5. Only 23% activity
was demonstrated when PPEBL21 was heated up to 60◦
C
(Figure 4).

PPEBL21 was found to be stable at pHs ranging from 7.0
to 10.5 and the maximal activity was observed at pH 7.0 to
8.0 in Tris-HCl buﬀer. In citrate phosphate buﬀer (pH 2.5
to 8.0) PPEBL21 was found to be less active and its maximal
anti-Aspergillus activity (76.67%) was observed at pH 7.0 in
citrate phosphate buﬀer (Figure 5).
3.4. Target Gene-Products. The mycelial proteins of untreated
and treated cultures of A. fumigatus after 36 hours were
analyzed to determine the eﬀect of the molecule on gene
products of the pathogen. The protein concentration in
mycelial extract was determined and equal amounts of both
proteins (untreated and treated) were run on SDS-PAGE.
Figure 6 shows the eﬀect of PPEBL21 on protein proﬁle of A.
fumigatus. It was observed that the expression of one protein
in the molecular weight range of 16.0 kDa was completely
inhibited by the molecule. These results indicated that the
gene of this protein was the potential target for PPEBL21.
The protein which was targeted by PPEBL21 was sliced
out from the gel and subjected for analysis by LCMS.
As a result the sequence of the protein was found to be
IENINGEFVFH. This sequence of the protein was subjected
to MASCOT search for sequence homology. The best match

of the sequence obtained in the current study showed a
score of 64 with a hypothetical protein of A. fumigatus. It is,
therefore, presumed that the gene responsible for expression
of 16.0 kDa hypothetical protein in A. fumigatus may be one
of the important targets for PPEBL21.
4. Discussion
Since MALDI and N-Terminal amino acid sequence results
suggested that PPEBL21 might be an alcohol dehydrogenase
from medium chain dehydrogenase family [10], we inves-
tigated the molecule for its ADH activity. Initial enzyme
activity experiments showed that PPEBL21 was able to
catalyze the conversion of speciﬁc aldehyde substrate into
colored product. We observed that at pH 7.5, PPEBL21 in
the presence of NADH, reduced propionaldehyde only but
it was not able to reduce other aldehydes. The optimum
activity of ADH using propionaldehyde as a substrate was
observed by MacGibbon et al. [17] also at pH 7.6. Brisdelli
et al. [18] investigated ADH puriﬁed from K. lactis for its
activity using various aldehydes such as acetaldehyde, pro-
pionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde,
salicylaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde,
and benzaldehyde and found that their preparation was
able to reduce propionaldehyde and butyraldehyde only.
Schenkels and Duine [19] puriﬁed an ADH from Rhodococ-
cus erythropolis DSM 1069 which could reduce formaldehyde
only but not other tested aldehydes. Bryant et al. [20]
reported ADH from Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus which
was able to reduce propionaldehyde. These observations as
well as the results obtained in the present study suggested
that the ADH-like molecules obtained from diﬀerent sources
may diﬀer in their speciﬁcity for the substrates.
The substrate speciﬁcity of an enzyme is generally
determined by the size, shape and location of substrate cleft.
The substrate binding site of ADH has been found to be a
20 ˚A deep cleft [21]. The inner part of the substrate cleft is
formed by the catalytic zinc at the bottom, its ligand and
the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme. The main part of
the substrate cleft has been very hydrophobic because of the
amino acid side chains forming the lining which determines
the substrate speciﬁcity [22]. Horse liver ADH was reported
to oxidize and reduce wide range of alcohols and aldehydes.
It oxidized some secondary alcohols also probably due to
the large size of substrate cleft and the presence of smaller
residues in the walls of the pocket compared with other
ADHs [20]. The reduced size of amino acids may allow the
enhanced reduction of aldehydes larger than acetaldehyde. It
has been shown that ADHs containing Ser rather than Thr at
position 48 were able to reduce larger aldehydes rather than
smaller [23]. It might be possible that PPEBL21 contains
compatible size of active cleft having small size amino acids
like Ser at appropriate position in the reactive pocket which
enabled it to reduce propionaldehyde most optimally.
In-gel digestion assay also proved that PPEBL21 was an
alcohol dehydrogenase. After native PAGE and subsequent
staining with propionaldehyde, PPEBL21 activity was found
as smear but this activity was not detected when other
aldehydes were used as substrate. When standard ADH (pur-
chased from Sigma) was incubated with propionaldehyde,
it showed ADH activity by reducing the propionaldehyde
in the presence of NADH. Vaglenova et al. [24] also
observed smear when puriﬁed ADH was incubated with
staining mixture alongwith substrate, 1-butanol. Similarly,
Hou et al. [25] reported ADH activity by incubating the ADH
containing native gel in primary and secondary butanol as
substrate. The kinetic data of PPEBL21 plotted according to
Michaelis-Menten, resulted in typical curves indicating that
the enzyme followed a sequentially ordered mechanism of
rate of reaction [26] which has been described for an ADH
[27].
Iso-electric point of PPEBL21 was found to be 7.8, but
pI of propanol preferring ADH of E. coli has been reported
to be 5.1 [28]. It is thus hypothesized that PPEBL21 isolated
from E. coli BL21 might contain some speciﬁc sites in
the molecule for ADH activity but it could be a diﬀerent
molecule than ADH. The diﬀerence, although very small, in
molecular weight of PPEBL21 from that of ADH of E. coli
reported earlier [27], was also evident. Since the PPEBL21
demonstrated sequence similarity with ADH and also the
ADH activity with speciﬁc substrates, we had reason to
believe that PPEBL21 was a molecule of ADH family. So,
an immediate question was that if PPEBL21 was an ADH,
then commercially available ADH may contain antifungal
activity. But surprisingly we did not ﬁnd antifungal activity
in commercially available ADH (of Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
that we purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. USA. It thus,
6 International Journal of Microbiology
appears that PPEBL21 is a unique molecule which has
potential against fungi pathogenic to humans and also has
the active sites responsible for ADH activity.
In the present study, we found that antifungal activity
of PPEBL21 remained intact up to 40◦
C and there was
complete loss of inhibitory activity at 80◦
C. Kim and Chung
[28] reported that antifungal activity of protein puriﬁed
from B. amyloliquifaciens MET0908 was stable up to 70◦
C
without signiﬁcant loss of activity but showed sensitivity to
increased temperatures. It demonstrated 70% activity after
exposure to a temperature of 80◦
C and only 50% activity
was observed after exposure of their protein to 100◦
C. The
antifungal activity of SAP puriﬁed from Streptomyces was
reported to be decreased with increasing temperature and
lost its activity completely at 90◦
C [29]. Magnusson and
Schnurer [30] recovered comparatively less stable antifungal
products because they observed that the antifungal activity
of freeze dried culture was lost during prolonged storage.
Woo et al. [29] demonstrated that SAP was active over a
wide pH range starting from pH 6.0 to pH 11.0 and the
maximal activity was observed between pH 7.0 to 8.0. We
also observed the maximal activity of PPEBL21 at pH 7.0 to
8.0.
The molecule PPEBL21 was also studied to ﬁnd out its
possible targets in the pathogens. The analysis of protein
proﬁle from treated and untreated A. fumigatus showed that
the molecule completely inhibited the expression of few
genes at the time of early development. One of the major
proteins of A. fumigatus which was found to be completely
inhibited by the molecule was 16 kDa. The analysis of peptide
mass ﬁngerprinting and homology search indicated that the
protein targeted by PPEBL21 showed a signiﬁcant score of
64 with hypothetical protein of A. fumigatus. More work
is required to establish if the gene product targeted by
PPEBL21 was hypothetical protein of A. fumigatus. However,
the information obtained from the results suggested that
the inhibition of the hypothetical protein may be useful to
develop high throughput screening system for screening of
new molecules.
