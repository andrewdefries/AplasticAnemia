Abstract
We report a case of a 48-year-old Chinese female with end-stage renal disease and chronic anemia on hemodialy-
sis. Clonazepam was prescribed for myoclonus disorder two weeks prior to her hospitalization. Subsequently, she
was hospitalized for neutropenic fever with thrombocytopenia and worsening anemia. Bone marrow examination
demonstrated a markedly hypocellular marrow (10-20% total cellularity). Clonazepam was discontinued, with gra-
dual improvement of thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia in 1-2 weeks. To our knowledge, this is the first reported
case of pancytopenia associated with clonazepam. We recommend patients taking clonazepam to be monitored
with regular complete blood count to check for clinically significant pancytopenia or thrombocytopenia.
Introduction
Clonazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative is used for the
treatment of epilepsy, psychiatric, and neurologic disor-
ders [1]. Clonazepam has also been utilized in alleviating
movement disorders and restless leg syndrome in
patients with end-stage renal disease [2,3]. Cases of
thrombocytopenia from clonazepam and other benzo-
diazepines have been described [4-6]. We report an
event of pancytopenia associated with clonazepam in a
patient with end-stage renal disease.
Case Report
A 48-year-old Chinese female with end-stage renal
disease on hemodialysis, and mild chronic anemia
presented with fever, chills and new-onset leukopenia
and thrombocytopenia. She was started on clonazepam
(0.25 mg orally twice a day) for myoclonus approxi-
mately two weeks prior. Her other medicines included
erythropoietin, felodipine, aluminum hydroxide, calcium
carbonate, labetalol, folic acid, and daily vitamin B com-
plex. She received two units of packed red blood cells
for worsening anemia, with a hemoglobin value of 6 g/dL.
Post-transfusion complete blood count (CBC) revealed a
hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL (MCV 92 fL), white blood
cell (WBC) count of 460/μL (absolute neutrophil count of
69/μL), and platelet count of 89,640/μL. She subsequently
developed fever and chills and was admitted to the
hospital the following day.
On the day of admission, CBC showed a WBC count
of 386/μL (absolute neutrophil count of 49/μL), hemo-
globin of 8.17 g/dL (MCV 91.2 fL), and platelet count of
62,300/μL. Blood culture was obtained which exhibited
no growth of microorganisms. She was empirically trea-
ted with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Evaluation for
human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and hepatitis
C viruses were negative. Antinuclear antibody study was
non-reactive. Both folate and vitamin B12 levels were
within normal ranges. Peripheral blood smear revealed
pancytopenia without leukemic blasts. A bone marrow
biopsy predominately consisted of adipose tissue, with
significantly decreased myeloid and erythroid precursors,
as well as megakaryocytes, reflecting a 10-20% overall
cellularity (Figs. 1 and 2). No aggregates of blasts or
atypical cells were identified. Review of medications sug-
gested that clonazepam, which was added to the
patient’s regimen two weeks prior to admission, most
likely precipitated pancytopenia. Clonazepam was conse-
quently discontinued. Her other medications were main-
tained. The thrombocytopenia resolved in four days, and
neutropenia gradually improved within 1-2 weeks. She
was discharged about a week from the day of admission,
with CBC showing WBC count of 1,460/μL, hemoglobin
of 7.56 g/dL, and platelet count of 246,000/μL.
Discussion
Several hypotheses have been illustrated in drug-induced
aplastic anemia including direct toxic effect to hemato-
poietic elements, and immune-mediated destruction sec-
ondary to idiosyncratic reaction to a drug [7]. El-Sayed
and Symonds reported a case of mild pancytopenia in a

patient receiving lorazepam and pelvic radiotherapy with
a nadir WBC of 2,300/μL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, and
platelet of 90,000/μL [8]. However, bone marrow evalua-
tion was not performed to exclude primary or radiation-
related hematologic conditions. Hence, direct effect
from radiotherapy could not be completely excluded.
Additionally, benzodiazepine-induced thrombocytopenia
has been shown to be mediated by platelet-specific anti-
bodies [6].
To our knowledge, our case represents the first
reported occurrence of pancytopenia associated with
clonazepam. Patients taking clonazepam must be moni-
tored with regular CBC analyses to check for likely
development of clinically significant pancytopenia or
thrombocytopenia. If indicated, serology may also be
pursued to determine the presence of benzodiazepine-
dependent antibodies against platelet. Cessation of the
drug usually results in gradual improvement of blood
counts. Patients should not be re-challenged once hema-
tologic dyscrasia has been documented.
