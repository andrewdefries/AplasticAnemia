Background:The therapeutic strategies for malignant melanoma are still cancer chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, and tumor resection. However, these therapeutic strategies often lead to a reduced
neutrophilic granulocyte count or loss of more blood after surgical tumor resection. In this study,
we developed a formulation of hemostatic gauze impregnated with sustained-release granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) with increasing of the neutrophilic granulocyte count in the
blood following chemotherapy and decreasing blood loss after surgical tumor resection.
Methods: We designed a formulation with both hemostatic properties and increased neutrophil
content to be used in cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and tumor resection, comprising a
hemostatic gauze as a scaffold and (G-CSF)-loaded dextran nanoparticles coated with polylactic-
co-glycolic acid (PLGA) solution fabricated by direct spray-painting onto the scaffold and then
vacuum-dried at room temperature. The performance of this system was evaluated in vitro and
in vivo.
Results: Nearly zero-order release of G-CSF was recorded for 12–14 days, and the cumulative
release of G-CSF retained over 90% of its bioactivity in a NFS-60 cell line proliferation assay
when the scaffold was incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at 37°C. The in vivo
hemostatic efficacy of this formulation was greater than that of native G-CSF, the scaffold
directly spray-painted with G-CSF solution or PLGA organic solution as a coating, or when a
blank scaffold was covered with the coating.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that this formulation has both hemostatic properties and
increased neutrophil activity.
Keywords: hemostatic gauze scaffold, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, bioactivity,

Introduction
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)1
is a member of a family of secreted
glycoproteins which act on both neutrophils and granulocyte precursors in the bone
marrow to promote their differentiation, proliferation, and maturation, to mobilize
neutrophils from the bone marrow pool into the peripheral blood circulation, and
to control neutrophil dynamics in the blood.2
G-CSF has been investigated as a
neuroprotective agent in neurological disorders3–7
and has been used clinically to
increase neutrophil levels in bone marrow transplantation,8
to aid recovery of the
neutrophil count in treatment of ritodrine-induced neutropenia,9
as an adjunct to
chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the treatment of cancer,10–13
and in various conditions,

including neutropenia associated with aplastic anemia or
myelodysplastic syndrome.
However, cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy often
lead to a reduced neutrophilic granulocyte count, and G-CSF
is used first-line for increasing neutrophilic granulocytes in
the blood.13
Clinical application of G-CSF involves frequent
injections, and compliance is poor. In order to enhance
compliance, the development of noninvasive dosage routes,
including nasal,14–16
pulmonary,17–19
and oral20–22
formulations
is expected, and investigations have been performed using
various formulations, but the bioavailability of these has
been very low, so they have met with little success.23,24
A long-acting injectable formulation enabling decreased
dosing frequency, PEGylated G-CSF, fusion G-CSF protein,
and sustained-release formulations have also been studied.25–27
However, PEGylation and fusion protein often causes G-CSF
bioactivity to decrease, and sustained-release formulations
suffer from loss of bioactivity and increased immunogenicity
due to the methods used in their preparation, eg, a shortage
of protective protein, oil-water or water-air interfaces of
water-in-oil (w/o),28
water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w), or water-
in-oil-in-oil (w/o/o) emulsion methods.29–31
We developed
several novel methods for preserving bioactivity of the protein
by avoiding creation of oil-water or water-air interfaces, such
as a stable aqueous-aqueous phase (“emulsion”) and a low-
temperature aqueous-aqueous phase separation method for
protein-loaded dextran nanoparticles or microparticles.32,33
These nanoparticles or microparticles may be used further to
prepare sustained-release formulations.34–36
For example, the
particles may be used to coat stents, scaffolds, and medical
devices. Because hemostatic gauze is often used following
tumor resection or in other diseases to stop bleeding, we
wanted to develop a formulation of hemostatic gauze
impregnated with sustained-release G-CSF. We hoped that
the formulation would increase the neutrophilic granulocyte
count in the blood following chemotherapy and decrease
blood loss after surgical tumor resection.
The objective of this study was to develop a surgical
hemostatic gauze scaffold with high encapsulating efficiency,
preserved protein stability, and ability to release G-CSF in
a sustained manner, by loading a hemostatic gauze scaffold
with G-GSF-dextran nanoparticles and coating the scaffold
with a polylactide-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) suspension.
The formulation was characterized by scanning electron
microscopy, size-exclusion chromatography-high-pressure
liquidchromatography(HPLC),invitroreleasecharacteristics,
a NSF-60 cell proliferation assay, and in vivo efficacy.
Materials and methods
Materials
PLGA (50:50, molecular weight 47 kDa; 50:50, molecular
weight 20 kDa) was obtained from Lakeshore BioMaterials
Inc (Kent, OH). Hemostatic gauze (oxidized regenerated
cellulose) was purchased from Ethicon SARL (Neuchatel,
Switzerland). Ethyl acetate (analytical reagent), dichlo-
romethane (analytical reagent), dextran (molecular weight
64,000–76,000, biochemical reagent) and polyethylene
glycol (PEG, molecular weight 6000, biochemical reagent)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). G-CSF
was supplied by Jinsai Yaoye Co Ltd (Changchun, China).
A human G-CSF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit
was purchased from R&D Systems Inc (Minneapolis, MN).
A bipotential murine hemopoietic cell line (NFS-60) was
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA).
Animals
Adult male Sprague Dawley rats weighing approximately
200  g were used. The animals were maintained under
standardized rodent conditions at a room temperature of
22°C ± 1°C. The animal experiments complied with the
principles of laboratory animal care and were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee of
Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles
A 3 mL mixture of dextran (1%, w/w), G-CSF (0.25%,
w/w), and PEG (5%, w/w) in a ratio of 1:4:20 was
prepared,32
and then frozen in a refrigerator at -80°C
overnight. Samples were lyophilized using a Christ Alpha
1–2 laboratory freeze-dryer at a pressure of 5.25 × 10–3
Pa
for 24 hours. The lyophilized powders were washed with
5 mL of dichloromethane, then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm
for 5 minutes (Eppendorf 5415D, Hamburg, Germany)
to remove the supernatant liquid, ie, the PEG continuous
phase (because G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles are
insoluble in dichloromethane and would precipitate in the
bottom of the centrifuge tube). The washing-centrifugation
procedure was repeated three times, and the G-CSF dextran
nanoparticles collected were evaporated at 1.33 Pa and
room temperature for 24  hours using a vacuum dryer
(Fuma DZF-3, Shanghai Fuma Co Ltd, Shanghai, China)
to remove the dichloromethane residue. The nanoparticles
obtained contained less than 0.5% (w/w) PEG after the
washing process.

Surgical scaffold of sustained-release drug
Hemostatic gauze scaffold
with G-GSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles
The hemostatic gauze scaffold containing G-GSF-loaded
dextran nanoparticles was prepared by spraying and painting
a 2.5 cm × 1 cm piece of hemostatic gauze scaffold with a
suspension containing G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles
and PLGA ethyl acetate solution or G-CSF in aqueous
solution and PLGA ethyl acetate solution at a rate of
0.25 mL/minute. The suspension was prepared by vortex
mixing 5% PLGA ethyl acetate solution (containing 20 mg
PLGA) and 5 mg G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles
for 5 minutes. After initial drying, the hemostatic gauze
scaffold with G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles was put
in a refrigerator at 20°C for at least 10 hours, followed by
further evaporation at room temperature in a vacuum below
0.1 mbar for 48 hours to remove any dichloromethane residue.
The hemostatic gauze scaffold containing G-CSF-loaded
dextran nanoparticles was then sprayed and painted with
additional G-CSF dextran nanoparticle-free PLGA (14 mg),
with the outer layer free of dextran nanoparticles to improve
the release kinetics of G-CSF.
After the hemostatic gauze scaffold containing G-CSF-
loaded dextran nanoparticles had been refrigerated at -20°C
and freeze-dried for 10 hours, the pure hemostatic gauze
scaffold was attached and adhered to the surface of the
hemostatic gauze scaffold containing G-CSF-loaded dextran
nanoparticles and further evaporated in a vacuum below
0.1 mbar for 48 hours to remove any dichloromethane residue
at room temperature.
Scanning electron microscopy
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the
hemostatic gauze, hemostatic gauze scaffold containing
G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles, and the G-CSF
dextran nanoparticles alone were obtained using a FEI
Sirion 200 SEM (Hillsboro, OR). Prior to image scanning,
the samples were coated with gold vapor under an argon
atmosphere and at 5–10 keV.
Size distribution of G-CSF dextran
nanoparticles
The size distribution and average particle size of the G-CSF
dextran nanoparticles were detected using a particle size and
shape analyzer (Ankersmid CIS-100, Edegem, ­Belgium).
Ten milligrams of dry particles were resuspended in a
quartz cell containing isopropyl alcohol with a stirring
magnet bar.
G-CSF encapsulation efficiency
The hemostatic gauze scaffold containing G-CSF-loaded
dextran nanoparticles was washed with 10 mL dichlo-
romethane, and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes
to remove the PLGA and recover the G-CSF-loaded dextran
nanoparticles, which were then redissolved in phosphate-
buffered saline (pH 7.4) and diluted using a G-CSF enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay kit. The G-CSF encapsulation
efficiency of the hemostatic gauze scaffold with G-CSF-
loaded dextran nanoparticles was determined using the
following equation:
	 Encapsulation efficiency (%) = P/Pt
 × 100
where P is the actual total weight of G-CSF encapsulated
into the coating on the scaffold and Pt
is the theoretical
amount of G-CSF (obtained from feeding) encapsulated
into the coating. The standard deviation for drug loading
was calculated based on the coating experiments which were
repeated five times.
Size exclusion chromatography
Size exclusion chromatography was carried out using a
HPLC system equipped with a TSK G2000SWXL size
exclusion column (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). Elution was
performed using a peristaltic pump with 50 mM phosphate-
buffered saline (pH 7.3) and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/minute
at room temperature. Absorbance of each sample was
measured at a wavelength of 214 nm. The dissolved G-CSF
sample was filtered using a 0.22 µm film and then injected
into the HPLC system. The flow rate of the mobile phase
was 1.0 mL/minute. The amount of monomer or aggregate
G-CSF was calculated using the Chromato-Solution-Light
Shimadzu software.
In vitro release profile
The 2.5 cm × 1 cm hemostatic gauze scaffolds containing
G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles (18  mg) were
individually incubated in vials containing 2 mL of phos-
phate-buffered saline (100  mM, pH 7.4) at 37°C under
constant shaking. For G-CSF release, the release medium
was replaced by fresh buffer on a scheduled date and the
G-CSF contents were assayed using a G-CSF enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay kit. For each sample, the
G-CSF release experiment was repeated five times and
release profiles were calculated based on the average of
three experiments.

In vitro release bioactivity
A NFS-60 cell line were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco®
,
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with 10% fetal calf serum and
5 ng/mL G-CSF. Prior to the assays, exponentially growing
cells were washed free of G-CSF and resuspended in
RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal calf serum. Samples containing
5 × 104
cells were incubated in 100 mL of RPMI 1640 with
10% fetal calf serum containing solution released from
hemostatic gauze scaffold containing G-CSF-loaded dextran
nanoparticles. After 48 hours, growth of NFS-60 cells was
determined using the MTT method.37
In vivo release study
Five male Sprague Dawley rats (6 weeks old, average
weight 200 g) underwent subcutaneous implantation of a
hemostatic gauze scaffold loaded with native G-CSF dextran
nanoparticles, a G-CSF-loaded hemostatic gauze scaffold
using native G-CSF solution and PLGA suspension, or a
pure hemostatic gauze scaffold at 0.15 mg/kg. A 0.4 mL
blood sample was collected using a heparinized syringe from
each animal at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 15 days after
implantation. The blood samples were centrifuged at rate of
12,000 rpm at 4°C for 20 minutes, and then plasma samples
were collected. Plasma G-CSF levels were determined using
a G-CSF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit.
In vivo efficacy study
For the in vivo efficacy study, 6-week-old Sprague
Dawley rats underwent subcutaneous implantation of a
hemostatic gauze scaffold containing G-CSF-loaded ­dextran
nanoparticles, a hemostatic gauze scaffold loaded with
native G-CSF solution and PLGA suspension, a subcutane-
ous injection of native G-CSF solution at 0.15 mg/kg, or
physiological saline. A 0.2 mL blood sample was collected
from each rat using a heparinized syringe at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 10, 12, and 15 days after administration. Neutrophil counts
were determined as described previously.38
The percentage
of neutrophils was determined using a complete blood count
(Beckman Coulter LH, Fullerton, CA), and the increasing
ratio of neutrophils per µL of blood was measured using
the neutrophil percentage of G-CSF samples divided by
neutrophil percentage of physiological saline samples.
To observe the hemostatic efficacy of the hemostatic gauze
scaffold containing G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles,
we implanted three pieces of hemostatic gauze scaffold,
ie, one piece of pure hemostatic gauze scaffold, one piece
containing G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles, and a piece
of pure hemostatic gauze scaffold adhered to the surface of a
hemostatic gauze scaffold containing G-CSF-loaded dextran
nanoparticles, and then measured the time to hemostasis.
Statistical analysis
The data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation,
and statistically significant differences were sought using the
Student’s t-test. P , 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS
software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).
Results
Morphology and size distribution
The morphology of the samples was characterized using SEM
and an Olympus µ710 camera. Figure 1 shows the morphol-
ogy of the hemostatic gauze scaffolds containing different
coatings at different release times. We found that the implants
started to degrade on day 2 and the hemostatic gauze in the
scaffold implants was completely broken down by day 7.39
Figure 2F, G, and H confirm this finding. Figure 2A and B
are images for G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles alone
and G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles recovered from the
scaffold, respectively. The results show that the surfaces of
both G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles alone and those
recovered from the scaffold were smooth and nonporous, with
the same size and morphology. Figure 2C and D are images for
a blank hemostatic gauze scaffold and a scaffold containing
G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles, respectively.The hemo-
static gauze scaffold had a fibrous structure in which groups
of fine fibers formed larger bundles of fibers. The hemostatic

ticles regardless of 5% G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles

Surgical scaffold of sustained-release drug
and PLGA lead to complete coverage of the tops of the fiber
bundles, and as a result, the fibrous structure became invisible
(Figure 2D). A cross-section of a hemostatic gauze scaffold
containing G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles showed that
the nanoparticles and PLGA ­contained gaps (Figure 2E).
Figure 2F,G,andHshowedthatthescaffolditselfdegradedand
became more porous.The mean diameter of the G-CSF-loaded
dextran nanoparticles was 100 ± 20 nm, with the majority of
nanoparticles ranging from 60 to 100 nm.
G-CSF encapsulation efficiency from
coating of hemostatic gauze implants
G-CSF encapsulation efficiency was measured using a
human G-CSF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit.
The encapsulation efficiency of the first-step particles, ie,
loading the proteins into the dextran nanoparticles, was
above 95% (w/w),32
and also for the subsequent two steps.
The G-CSF loading yield was 96% for the samples projecting
1% G-CSF loads (ie, G-CSF reached 1% of the total mass
of the coating material).
Aggregation study in hemostatic gauze
scaffolds containing G-CSF-loaded
dextran nanoparticles
Formation of protein aggregates gives a good indication of
protein integrity during the microencapsulation process.40
Therefore, we assayed the samples using size-exclusion
chromatography-HPLC in order to determine any change
in G-CSF with the different procedures. Figure 3 shows the
size-exclusion chromatography-HPLC results for G-CSF
aggregation after each preparation step. Figure 3A, B, C,
and D show the monomer contents of the original G-CSF
solution, G-CSF from the dextran nanoparticles, recovery
from hemostatic gauze scaffold containing G-CSF-loaded
dextran nanoparticles, and from hemostatic gauze scaffold
loaded directly with G-CSF solution and PLGA suspension,
respectively.The monomer content of G-CSF did not decrease
during the coating process compared with the original sample,
except that the monomer content of G-CSF in the hemostatic
gauze scaffold loaded with G-CSF decreased by 20%. These
results strongly suggest that the implant preparation process
used in the present study is a useful method for coating hemo-
static gauze scaffold implants without aggregation.

Bioactivity of hemostatic gauze scaffold
containing G-CSF-loaded dextran
nanoparticles
In order to determine the bioactivity of the different
samples, G-CSF was recovered from the formulations
according to the method used for determination of G-CSF
encapsulation efficiency. The bioactivity of G-CSF was
assayed using the NFS-60 cell line. Figure  4  shows
the bioactivity of G-CSF from the different samples,
­respectively. Figure 4A, B, and C shows the bioactivity of
the original G-CSF solution, G-CSF from G-CSF-loaded
dextran nanoparticles, and G-CSF from the hemostatic
gauze scaffold containing G-CSF-loaded dextran nanopar-
ticles (PLGA 50/50 3A), respectively. We found that the
bioactivity of the samples was almost the same as for the
original G-CSF solution (P . 0.05). Figure 4D, E, and F
show the bioactivity of G-CSF from a hemostatic gauze
scaffold containing G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles
(PLGA 50/50 1A), a hemostatic gauze scaffold loaded
with G-CSF solution (PLGA 50/50 3A), and a hemostatic
gauze scaffold loaded directly using G-CSF solution and
PLGA suspension (PLGA 50/50 1A), respectively. The
results show that the recovered bioactivity of G-CSF from
a hemostatic gauze scaffold containing G-CSF-loaded dex-
tran nanoparticles (PLGA 50/50 1A), a hemostatic gauze
scaffold loaded with G-CSF solution and PLGA suspension
(PLGA 50/50 3A and PLGA 50/50 1A, respectively) was
decreased by 17%, 55%, and 60%, respectively (P , 0.05).
The recovered bioactivity suggested that the G-CSF in
the G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles had been well
protected during the preparation process. This is probably
because G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles might avoid
oil-water and water-gas interfaces which result in loss of
G-CSF bioactivity.31
Release kinetics for hemostatic gauze
scaffold containing G-CSF-loaded dextran
nanoparticles
Figure 5A and B summarize the G-CSF release profiles
for hemostatic gauze scaffolds containing PLGA coatings
of different molecular weights. Interestingly, as shown
in Figure 5, the two samples showed a similar zero order
G-CSF release profile regardless of molecular weight (release
kinetics equations: QA
 = 12.574t + 9.4172, R2
 = 0.9705 and
QB
 = 8.90003t + 7.4446, R2
= 0.962, from day 1 to day 7),
but the amount of cumulative release was less from the low
molecular weight polymer than from the high molecular
weight polymer. We reported the result of the degradation
study by plotting the weight of each formulation against the
release incubation time at 37°C. When a piece of hemostatic
gauze scaffold containing no coating (2.5 cm × 1 cm, 18 mg)
was incubated in 2 mL of phosphate-buffered saline at 37°C,
the total mass completely disappeared within 3 days.39
As
shown in Figures 1, 2F, G, and H, hemostatic gauze scaf-
folds coated with G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles and
a PLGA layer of different molecular weights or with an
additional blank PLGA layer all broke down during the same
time period, suggesting that the rate of release of G-CSF

Surgical scaffold of sustained-release drug
was due to degradation of the hemostatic gauze scaffold and
independent of the PLGA coating.When G-CSF solution was
loaded into hemostatic gauze scaffold using PLGA coating,
the percentage cumulative release was only 30%–40%. This
was probably because the spraying and painting process
produced a number of oil-water and gas-water interfaces,
resulting in G-CSF aggregation and more hydrophobicity,
with no release of G-CSF.31
In vitro G-CSF release bioactivity
in hemostatic gauze scaffold containing
G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles
The bioactivity of in vitro release from hemostatic gauze
scaffolds containing G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles
was investigated using the NFS-60 cell line. Figure 6A
and B show that the bioactivity of release of G-CSF from
hemostatic gauze scaffolds containing G-CSF-loaded dex-
tran nanoparticles (PLGA 50/50 3A and PLGA 50/50 1A)
showed high efficiency. The release bioactivity percent of
G-CSF on the first day was 20% of the cumulative release
bioactivity of G-CSF, and the percent of cumulative release
bioactivity was about 80%–96% of the total bioactivity
within the scaffold coating. When the G-CSF solution was
loaded into hemostatic gauze scaffolds with PLGA coating,
the percent cumulative release bioactivity of G-CSF was
only 30%–40%. This was probably because the spraying
and painting process produced a number of oil-water and
gas-water interfaces resulting in G-CSF aggregation and
more hydrophobicity.31
Release of G-CSF in an in vivo rat study
We examined the release of G-CSF from the G-CSF-loaded
dextran nanoparticles and from a hemostatic gauze scaffold
loaded directly using G-CSF solution and PLGA suspension,
because the G-CSF released is only bioactive in vivo. ­Figure 7
◊ and ♦ show the plasma G-CSF concentration-time release
profiles for G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles and hemo-
static gauze scaffold loaded directly with G-CSF solution and
PLGA suspension, respectively. The results showed a stable
plasma concentration from days 1 to 7, and then slow release
of G-CSF up to day 15 from hemostatic gauze scaffolds
containing G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles. However,
scaffolds loaded directly with G-CSF solution and PLGA
suspension did not show stable plasma concentrations, with
fast release of G-CSF from day 1 to day 3, and no G-CSF
release thereafter. This confirms that the hemostatic gauze
scaffold containing G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles
was more effective than the scaffold containing the directly
loaded G-CSF solution.
In vivo efficacy study
To compare the in vivo efficacy of scaffolds containing
G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles, scaffolds containing
directly loaded G-CSF solution, pure scaffolds, and native
G-CSF alone, male Sprague Dawley rats underwent
subcutaneous implantation with scaffolds loaded with
dextran nanoparticles, scaffolds loaded with G-CSF, pure
scaffolds, or subcutaneous injection of native G-CSF at
0.15 mg/kg. Changes in neutrophil count were determined

for 15 days. The time courses in Figure 8 , ◊, and ♦
show that scaffolds containing G-CSF-loaded dextran
nanoparticles or G-CSF solution achieved a significant
increase in neutrophil count for a prolonged period of time,
but the increasing ratio of neutrophil count and prolonged
time from G-CSF solution-loaded the scaffold were more
than G-CSF solution-loaded the scaffold (the pure scaf-
fold did not show an increase in neutrophil count, data
not shown).
We found that the time to hemostasis for the scaffold
containing G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles was longer
than that for the same-sized pure hemostatic gauze scaffold
and pure hemostatic gauze scaffold adhered to a scaffold
loaded with dextran nanoparticles. However, the time to
hemostasis from both a pure hemostatic gauze scaffold and
a pure hemostatic gauze scaffold adhered to the surface of
a scaffold loaded with dextran nanoparticles was almost
the same (P , 0.05). This suggests that the scaffold loaded
with dextran nanoparticles might work for both increasing
the neutrophil count and stopping bleeding when the pure
hemostatic gauze scaffold was attached and adhered to the
surface of a scaffold loaded with dextran nanoparticles.

Surgical scaffold of sustained-release drug
Discussion
A zero order release profile for G-CSF was observed from the
scaffolds containing G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles,
regardless of the molecular weight of the PLGA coating
used from days 1 to 7 (Figures 5A and B). This finding sug-
gests that the rate-limiting step for G-CSF release was not
just controlled by PLGA, but by other factors, including the
dextran nanoparticles and the scaffold. The pure scaffold
is easily degraded, taking 1–2 weeks to break down into
molecular pieces (http://store.k12webstore.com/mkgz24.
html), and dextran nanoparticles also absorb water and
swell.43
These observations suggest that pores or holes in
the surface of the PLGA coating can be created when a pure
hemostatic gauze scaffold with PLGA is degraded and broken
fragments form.39
Rapid degradation of the hemostatic gauze
scaffold creates sufficient penetration of water diffusion chan-
nels for G-CSF release of all implants coated with PLGA of
different molecular weights.39
At the same time, the G-CSF
diffusion distance from the inner to outer coating decreases
due to swelling of the dextran nanoparticles through absorp-
tion of water compared with no swelling additives.42
These resulting in that at the beginning of the release
phase, G-CSF were near the coating surface of the G-CSF-
loaded dextran nanoparticle scaffolds, then the hemostatic
gauze scaffold started to degrade and formed more and more
new holes in the coating that led to water being permeated
into the coating and increased diffusion of G-CSF and dextran
swelling (of course, finally dextran also was dissolved and
diffused, the PLGA also was degraded, but PLGA degraded
slower than the pure scaffold during the whole release
process). With these diffusion channels, the diffusion rate
of G-CSF became significantly higher than that of high
molecular weight dextran, thus the overall release rate
was limited by the swelling of dextran. Figure 2F–H also
confirmed the process.39
The linear release from the G-CSF-
loaded dextran nanoparticle scaffold appeared attributable to
the above effects.44–46
Figures 5A and B, 6A and B also show that the degra-
dation rate of PLGA did not affect the release rate or cell
proliferation activity of the G-CSF released or the cumulative
amount released from the scaffolds containing G-CSF-loaded
dextran nanoparticles.The cumulative amount released from
scaffolds containing G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles
with PLGA of higher molecular weight was more than that of
PLGA of lower molecular weight.This was possibly because
G-CSF was unstable in a locally acidic environment, 41,43
in
which the degradation rate of lower molecular weight PLGA
was faster than for higher molecular weight PLGA which, in
turn, formed a more acidic local environment.41,43
Figure 5C
and D show further release kinetic profiles which were
probably because G-CSF had aggregated and become more
hydrophobic, resulting in no release of G-CSF,43
suggesting
that the spray-painted coatings had produced a number of
oil-water and gas-water interfaces.31
In order to understand the mechanism of the scaffold, a
pure hemostatic gauze scaffold was attached and adhered to
the surface of a hemostatic gauze scaffold containing G-CSF-
loaded dextran nanoparticles for study of in vitro and in vivo
release. We found that the release profile, plasma G-CSF
level, and increase in neutrophil count were the same for a
hemostatic gauze scaffold containing G-CSF-loaded dextran
nanoparticles (data no shown), but that the time to hemostasis

was shorter. This suggested that the pure hemostatic gauze
scaffold does not affect the activity of the G-CSF-loaded
dextran nanoparticle scaffold in terms of release of G-CSF,
but may improve hemostasis activity.
By coating the gauze scaffold with G-CSF-loaded dextran
nanoparticles and PLGA suspension, sustained-release delivery
of the drug can be achieved easily. In addition, the desired
release kinetics, such as a low level of initial burst release and a
zero order release profile can also be easily achieved. With the
right thickness, the G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticle-free
top layer of PLGA may provide additional control of G-CSF
releasemechanisms.ThePLGAcoatingonthehemostaticgauze
scaffold can easily be attached and applied to the wound surface
during surgery to stop post-surgical bleeding and to improve
theneutrophilicgranulocytecountinbloodduringchemotherapy
as well as to staunch bleeding after tumor resection.
Conclusion
Using a clinically available hemostatic agent as a scaffold,
we demonstrated that a hemostatic gauze scaffold containing
G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticles can achieve controlled
delivery of G-CSF. G-CSF were released from this formula-
tion through a mechanism of diffusion channels independent
of G-CSF-loaded different molecular weight PLGA that was
created due to rapid degradation of the hemostatic gauze
scaffold inside the PLGA coating and dextran microparticle
swelling. Such diffusion channels could be blocked by an
additional coating of G-CSF-loaded dextran nanoparticle-
free PLGA to reach the desired G-CSF release rate. In
addition to nearly zero order and burst-free release kinetics,
this formulation approach was simple and did not require a
complicated microencapsulation process, thus could easily
be scaled up and potentially used to improve the neutrophilic
granulocyte level in blood at the time of chemotherapy and
staunch bleeding after tumor resection.
