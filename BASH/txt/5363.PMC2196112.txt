Summary
Human CD34ϩ multilineage progenitor cells (CD34HPC) from cord blood and bone marrow
express CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor–receptor family present on various he-
matopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. As hyper-IgM patients with mutated CD40 ligand
(CD40L) exhibit neutropenia, no B cell memory, and altered T cell functions leading to severe
infections, we investigated the potential role of CD40 on CD34HPC development. CD40-
activated cord blood CD34HPC were found to proliferate and differentiate independently of
granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, into a cell population with prominent den-
dritic cell (DC) attributes including priming of allogeneic naive T cells. DC generated via the
CD40 pathway displayed strong major histocompatibility complex class II DR but lacked de-
tectable CD1a and CD40 expression. These features were shared by a dendritic population
identified in situ in tonsillar T cell areas. Taken together, the present data demonstrate that
CD40 is functional on CD34HPC and its cross-linking by CD40Lϩ cells results in the genera-
tion of DC that may prime immune reactions during antigen-driven responses to pathogenic
invasion, thus providing a link between hematopoiesis, innate, and adaptive immunity.
The CD34ϩ compartment of human progenitor cells
displays multilineage hematopoietic capacities, includ-
ing the generation of dendritic cells (DC) (1, 2). Human
CD34ϩ multilineage progenitor cells (CD34HPC)1 express
CD40 (3), a member of the TNFR/NGFR family instru-
mental in the activation, growth, and survival of various
hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells (4–7). CD40 li-
gation induces proliferation and survival of B lymphocytes,
turns on their isotype-switch machinery, and directs the
generation of memory B cells (8–12). CD40 triggering also
activates monocytes (13), mature DCs (14), endothelial
cells (15, 16), fibroblasts (17), and induces cytokine pro-
duction by thymic endothelial cells (18). However, in ad-
dition to mature B cells, only progenitor B cells (19) and fi-
broblasts have been shown to proliferate under CD40
stimulation.
The importance of CD40–CD40 ligand (CD40L) inter-
actions in vivo has been revealed in hyper-IgM (HIM)
patients bearing a mutated CD40L on T cells (20–24). As a
consequence, patients suffer from various bacterial and viral
infections as well as from Cryptosporidial diarrhea and Pneu-
mocystis carinii pneumonia. These infections may be the
consequence of several primary immunodeficiencies, in-
cluding defective B cell memory (excess of IgM and low or
absent secondary Ab responses), altered T cell responses,
and neutropenia (25). Because of the prominent link of
CD40 with cell proliferation and differentiation, and be-
cause of the defective humoral, cell-mediated immunity
and granulopoietic responses observed in HIM patients, we
engaged into the analysis of CD40 function on CD34HPC.
The data show that CD40 ligation induces CD34HPC to
proliferate and differentiate into cells with dendritic cell at-
tributes.
Materials and Methods
Cell Cultures. Mouse fibroblastic LtkϪ cells obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and trans-
fected with either CD40L (CD40L cells/CD40L system) or with
CD32 as control (CD32L cells), were prepared as previously
described (10, 14). Cultured fibroblastic cells were detached,
washed, irradiated (7,000 rads), and counted to seed 5,000 cells in
100 ␮l of culture medium (CM) per well in flat-bottomed 96-
well culture plates. Human CD34ϩ progenitor cells were purified
from cord blood of normal full-term deliveries according to insti-
tutional guidelines. In brief, mononuclear cells obtained by cen-
trifugation on Ficoll–HyPaque were sequentially labeled with a
sterile endotoxin-free murine mAb to CD34 (IOM34; Immuno-
tech, Marseille, France) and with filtered magnetic microbeads

342 CD40-dependent Generation of Dendritic Cells
(MiniMacs; Miltenyi Biotec, Bergish-Gladbach, Germany). La-
beled cells were selected by two passages through a magnetic sep-
aration column (MiniMacs Separation Column; Miltenyi Biotec),
and then thoroughly washed and seeded for culture. Yielding of
CD34ϩ cells ranged from 0.3% to 1.3% of the total mononuclear
cell initial population and final purity was у98% as confirmed by
flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry performed on cytospins
and BioRad slides (BioRad, Munich, Germany). CD34ϩ selected
cells thus scored negative for lineage-restricted markers (CD3,
CD4, CD14, CD15, CD16, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD33) and
were homogeneous small mononuclear cells with scant cyto-
plasm. 5 ϫ 103 CD34ϩ cells were seeded in 100 ␮l/well onto
equal amounts of irradiated murine fibroblastic L cells transfected
either with CD40L or with CD32 as control, or in CM alone
prepared with RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inacti-
vated FCS plus antibiotics. To estimate CD34HPC proliferation
after defined time periods, cultured cells were either thoroughly
resuspended to quantitate the number of viable cells by exclusion
of Trypan blue, or pulsed overnight with1 ␮Ci of [3H]thymidine
and harvested in triplicates. To assess the production of DC, 105
CD34HPC were plated onto 5 ϫ 104 irradiated L cells (CD40L L
cells or CD32 L cells as controls), in 48-well culture plates, in a
final volume of 500 ␮l of culture medium. At the time periods
indicated, cultured cells were resuspended to score the proportion
of DC. To assess the specificity of the system, neutralizing anti-
bodies to CD40 (mAb 89), CD40L (LL48) (both from our labo-
ratory), to granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM–CSF) (mAb 23B6, provided by Dr. J. Abrams, DNAX,
Palo Alto, CA), or isotype control antibodies (Sigma Immunochem-
icals, St. Louis, MO) were added to the cultures. The presence of
DC was assessed by four well-established criteria: morphology,
mobility, phenotype, and function. DC were then scored on Bio-
Rad adhesion slides following staining with anti-MHC class II
DR antibody. In addition, an evaluation was performed on May–
Grünwald-Giemsa stained cytospin preparations. Criteria for DC
identification included both clearly defined filiform cytoplasmic
projections and strong class II DR positivity. Cells showing only
pseudopod-like appearance were not considered as DC.
Immunostaining. Cultured cells resuspended and washed three
times in PBS were left 15 min at 20ЊC (104 cells in PBS on pre-
washed BioRad adhesion slides). The following primary antibod-
ies were used for 30 min at 20ЊC: CD1a (OKT6) from Ortho
Diagnostics (Raritan, NJ), CD1a (IOM6), CD4, CD13, CD19,
CD23, CD32, CD33, CD34, CD38, CD40 and CD44 from Im-
munotech; CD26, CD59, and CD90 from Serotec (Oxford, En-
gland); CD32 from Medarex, (West Lebanon, NH); CD14,
CD15, CD16, CD20, CD21, CD80 (B7-1), anti-MHC class II
DR, and isotype control antibodies from Becton-Dickinson
(Mountain View, CA); CD43 and CD68 from Dakopatts (Glos-
trup, Denmark); CD74 from The Binding Site (Birmingham, En-
gland); CD86 (B7-2) from PharMingen (San Diego, CA); anti-
MHC class I from SeraLab (Sussex, England); anti-relB from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); recombinant HIV-
gp120 from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France); anti-NGFR from
Boehringer-Mannheim (Federal Republic of Germany). CD45,
CD60, anti-pan cadherin, and anti-heat shock protein (HSP60)
antibodies were from Sigma Immunochemicals. Secondary step
antibodies included biotinylated sheep anti–mouse IgG, IgA, and
IgM (The Binding Site), biotinylated goat anti–rabbit (Dako) and
streptavidin–alkaline phosphatase from Tago-Immunologicals (Cam-
arillo, CA). For assessing HIV binding to DC, recombinant HIV-
gp120-FITC (Neosystem) was used, followed by a biotinylated
mouse mAb to FITC (Sigma) and streptavidin–alkaline phos-
phatase (Tago). For intracytoplasmic staining, saponin at 0.33% in
PBS was used throughout the staining protocol. Color was devel-
oped using a Fast Red developing System (Dako). For in situ
analysis, immunohistochemical staining of acetone-fixed cryostat
sections (8 ␮m) was performed by incubation with primary anti-
bodies to CD1a (IgG1, Immunotech), CD40 (IgG1, mAb 89),
followed by anti–mouse IgG1 and mouse APAAP or to MHC
class II DR (IgG2b), a biotinylated anti-mouse IgG2b mAb, and
streptavidin peroxidase. The alkaline phosphatase was revealed us-
ing Fast Blue as a chromogen (blue color) and the peroxidase was
developed by 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole (red color).
Cell Cycle Analysis of CD34HPC. Freshly prepared CD34HPC
or CD34HPC cultured for 3 d onto CD32 or CD40L-transfected
fibroblasts were gently resuspended, washed and incubated with
5 ␮g/ml of Hoechst 33342 (Calbiochem Novabiochem, La Jolla,
CA) during 45 min at room temperature to quantitate cycling
cells. Hoechst-stained cells were subsequently labeled with a
MoAb to CD34, washed, and analyzed in a FACSTAR® flow cy-
tometer (Becton-Dickinson).
MLR. To test their allostimulatory properties, CD40-derived
DC obtained at day 14 as previously described were irradiated
(6,000 rads), seeded at different concentrations, and incubated
with 2 ϫ 104 cord blood–derived CD4ϩ T cells obtained from a
different donor. CD4ϩ T cells were prepared from the mononu-
clear cell fraction by negative selection using a cocktail of anti-
bodies to CD8, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD20, CD40, and MHC
class II DR. Proliferation of naive T cells is expressed as incorpo-
ration of tritiated thymidine at day 5.
Limiting Dilution Assay. CD34HPC were seeded at a density
of 1, 10, or 100 cells/well in round-bottomed microtiter plates at
a final volume of 100 ␮l either onto irradiated CD40Lϩ L cells or
with GM–CSF (100 ng/ml)/TNF (2.5 ng/ml). After 12 d of cul-
ture, the number of wells with cell growth and the wells that
contained cells with recognizable DC morphology, respectively,
were scored. For each condition, a total number of 60 wells were
seeded with 100 CD34HPC/well and 600 wells were seeded
with 10 or 1 CD34HPC/well. One plate containing CD40LϪ fi-
broblastic cells was seeded with 100 CD34HPC/well and used as
a negative control.
Results
CD40 Ligation Induces Proliferation of CD34HPC. To in-
vestigate the potential role of the CD40 molecule on
CD34HPC, progenitor cells were cultured over CD40L-
transfected fibroblasts (CD40L cells/CD40L system), (10, 14)
or on CD32-transfected cells as control. CD40L-activated
CD34HPC entered into DNA synthesis, as measured by
tritiated thymidine incorporation that peaked around day 8
and declined by day 15 (Fig. 1 A). CD40-triggered prolif-
eration of progenitor cells was specific, because it was pre-
vented by antibodies to CD40 and CD40L but not by iso-
type-matched control antibodies (Fig. 1 B and E). The
observed DNA synthesis reflected actual cell proliferation
(Fig. 1 E) with a mean 10-fold increase in viable cells ob-
served at day 8 (four independent experiments). In con-
trast, there was no or only marginal increase in proliferation
of CD34HPC cultured over control CD32-transfected
cells (CD32 L cells; Fig. 1 A, B, E). Double labeling with
Hoechst 33342 and CD34 MoAb to assess the cell cycle of
CD34HPC confirmed the quiescent status of these cells
343 Flores-Romo et al.
when freshly isolated (data not shown). After 3 d of culture
over control CD32 L cells, few CD34HPC were cycling (Fig.
1 C). By contrast, a significant proportion of CD34HPC
were found in cycle when stimulated for 3 d by CD40L
(Fig. 1 D). However, at 24 h (data not shown), the per-
centage of cycling cells in CD40L cultures was only mar-
ginally higher than that of control cultures, indicating that
CD40L probably recruits a small proportion of CD34ϩ
cells whose cycling progeny accumulates with time.
CD40 Ligation Induces CD34HPC to Differentiate into
DC. 8-d cultures of CD34HPC on CD32L cells yielded
small round mononuclear cells morphologically compara-
ble to fresh CD34HPC (Fig. 2 a), whereas CD34HPC cul-
tured over CD40L L cells revealed small clusters of 10–50
cells displaying long cytoplasmic projections (Fig. 2 b).
These clusters grew progressively in size releasing individ-
ual cells (Fig. 2, c and d) that, by day 14, exhibited long
delicate and highly motile cytoplasmic processes (Fig. 2, c
and d, 15-s interval). Cytocentrifugation and Giemsa stain-
ing of CD40L-cultured CD34HPC revealed that a propor-
tion of cells displayed numerous and long dendrites (Fig. 2
e). A detailed immunophenotypic analysis of CD40-gener-
ated DC at day 14 showed high levels of MHC class II DR
antigen (Fig. 2 i), and the costimulatory molecules B7-1
(CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) (Table 1). At variance with
GM–CSF/TNF-derived DC, CD40-derived DC were neg-
ative for CD1a and CD40 (Table 1). Interestingly, CD40-
generated DC expressed high levels of the transactivating
factor rel-B (Fig. 2 h), associated with mature DC but ab-
sent from dendritic Langerhans cells (26). A small propor-
tion of CD40-derived DC could bind recombinant HIV-
gp120 (Fig. 2 f ) and expressed CD26 (Fig. 2 g). Occasional
DC exhibited beaded dendrites reminiscent of those observed
on follicular dendritic cells associated with iccosome release
(Fig. 2 g) (27). The nondendritic population from CD40L
cultures were nongranulocytic monocyte-like cells as deter-
mined by May–Grünwald–Giemsa staining (data not shown).
Independent analysis of five different CD34HPC samples cul-
tured 14 d over CD40L cells demonstrated 29.9% Ϯ 1.4%
motile cells by phase contrast microscopy, 37.4% Ϯ 3.7% cells
with dendrites by Giemsa staining, and 39.6% Ϯ 3.6% DC
with strong HLA DR expression (data not shown). Taken
together, these results demonstrate that a population of
CD34HPC can differentiate into DC after CD40 triggering.
Immunohistochemical analysis of secondary lymphoid
tissue (tonsils) revealed the presence of MHC class II DRϩ,
CD1aϪ and CD40Ϫ cells, with clear dendritic morphology,
scattered through the T cell areas where interdigitating cells
congregate (Fig. 2, j and k). These findings identify a corre-
late population in situ, precisely in the area where mature
DC localize to interact with low frequency Ag-specific
T cells in vivo.
Kinetics and Specificity of CD40-dependent Generation of
DC. Kinetic followup of CD40 stimulated CD34HPC
indicated early emergence of DC in cultures with 6% iden-
tifiable DC at day 4, 16% at day 8, and a maximum 36% by
day 14 (Fig. 3 A). As observed for proliferation, DC gener-
ation was specific for CD40 engagement, because antibod-
ies to either CD40 or CD40L efficiently blocked their ap-
pearance, whereas isotype-matched control antibodies were
ineffective (Fig. 3 B). Of note is the fact that a soluble fu-
sion protein constructed with CD40L and CD8 (sCD40L)
was also capable of inducing development of DC. How-
ever, the soluble product was less effective than poly-
valently immobilized CD40L, especially regarding dendrite
development (data not shown). Interestingly, neutralizing
anti-GM–CSF antibodies did not affect the CD40L-depen-
dent generation of DC (Fig. 3 B), which contrasts with
previous studies in vitro where DC generation was strictly
dependent on addition of GM–CSF (1, 28–31).
Clonal Analysis of CD34HPC Stimulated Through CD40.
Limiting dilution assays scored with an inverted micro-
scope after 12 d of culturing CD34HPC first confirmed
that control CD32-transfected fibroblasts alone do not pro-
mote generation of DC, even at the highest number of
progenitor cells (100) plated per well (Table 2). By con-
trast, cultures over CD40L L cells induced the generation
of clones containing DC (as determined by typical mor-
phology) in 3% of the wells seeded at 1 cell/well, a propor-
tion that increased to 10% and 36% when 10 and 100
CD34HPC were seeded per well, respectively. Parallel ex-
periments with GM–CSF-treated CD34HPC showed that
this cytokine was at least twice as efficient as CD40L in
generating DC in vitro (Table 2).

CD34HPC cultured as described in Materials and Methods were either

periments and data are presented as mean cpm Ϯ SD (A and B) and cell
numbers per ml Ϯ SD (E), as determined in triplicate wells. For quanti-
tating recovery of viable cells, 105 progenitor cells (indicated by horizon-
tal line in medium control bar) were seeded in 1.0 ml of culture medium
onto 105 CD40Lϩ cells or control CD32 cells. Results were evaluated at
days 4, 8, and 15 (A) or at day 8 only (B, E). Where indicated, cultures
were supplemented with mAbs to CD40 (mAb 89), CD40L (mAb LL48),
or isotype-matched control antibodies. (C, D) Cell cycle analysis.
CD34HPC freshly isolated (data not shown) or cultured either on CD32L
(C) or CD40L-transfected fibroblasts (D) for 3 d were resuspended and
incubated with Hoechst 33342. To quantitate specifically CD34HPC en-
tering into cycle, Hoechst-stained cells were subsequently labeled with a
mAb to CD34, washed, and analyzed with a FACSTARϩ® flow cytometer.

late T Cell Alloreaction. DC, unlike monocytes or lym-

lating the proliferation of naive T cells (28). As few as 300
CD40L-cultured CD34HPC were able to induce naive
CD4ϩ cord blood T cells (ratio 1/66) to enter into DNA
synthesis and 3,000 CD40L-derived DC (ratio 1/6.6) in-
creased T cell thymidine incorporation by 250-fold (Fig.
4). In contrast, freshly isolated or IL-3-cultured CD34HPC
are unable to induce naive T cell proliferation (1). Thus, in
addition to their morphology, motility and phenotype,

346 CD40-dependent Generation of Dendritic Cells
Discussion
The present study demonstrates that CD40 ligation of
cord blood CD34HPC results in their proliferation and
subsequent differentiation into DC.
DC generation was not dependent on the fibroblasts
themselves, because CD40LϪ LtkϪ cells transfected with
CD32 were uneffective. This was further corroborated by
using a soluble CD40L–CD8 fusion protein that also per-
mitted the production of DC (data not shown), though,
as observed for B cell functions (our unpublished observa-
tions), this reagent was less efficient than cell-bound CD40L,
especially for dendrite development.
CD34HPC were observed to be cycling in response to
CD40L triggering at day 3 of culture, but not at day 1. This
suggests that only a minor proportion of CD34HPC may
be driven into cycle and that the cycling population identi-
fied by day 3 results from accumulation of the initially re-
cruited progenitors. The low clone numbers obtained by
limiting dilution in response to CD40L is consistent with
the observed cell cycle kinetics. Limiting dilution analysis
also indicates that CD40L by itself is less efficient than the
combination of GM–CSF/TNF to generate DC.
In accordance with the latter finding, a comparative
analysis of bulk cultures of cord blood CD34ϩ progenitors
showed that GM–CSF/TNF results in a considerably
higher cell expansion (34.0 Ϯ 16.0-fold; n ϭ 10) than does
CD40 triggering (8.3 Ϯ 2.7 fold; n ϭ 5). In keeping with
differences observed between the two in vitro derived DC
populations, the presently described DC, although clearly
able to stimulate allogeneic naive T cells, appear less potent
stimulators on a cell-to-cell basis than the DC obtained in
GM–CSF/TNF cultures (Caux, C., and J. Banchereau, un-
published data). This observation may be related to the lack
of detectable CD40 on the CD40-derived DC as compared
with GM–CSF/TNF-derived cells (Table 1).
Although DC migratory routes and tissue residence are
relatively well known (32, 33), their precise ontogeny is
poorly understood. GM–CSF is considered an essential re-
quirement for generation of DC, whether from CD34HPC
(1, 29) or from monocytic cells (30, 31, 34). However, our
findings suggest an alternative GM–CSF-independent path-
way of DC ontogeny, the existence of which was indeed
revealed by the normal DC status of mice with inactivated
GM–CSF or GM–CSF-receptor genes (35, 36). However,
at this stage, the possibility that CD40 stimulation may trig-
ger the production of other endogenous cytokines relevant
for inducing DC differentiation from progenitor cells (i.e.,
kit–ligand/TNF), cannot be ruled out.
Interestingly, in a recent immunohistological study of
two HIM patients, interdigitating cells (IDCs) (referred to
as S100ϩ cells) in lymph node paracortex are reported as
being normal in one case, but as being rare in the second
patient (37). Although the topographic distribution and ex-
act phenotype of DC subsets in HIM patients requires fur-
ther analysis, it is possible that CD40-derived DC represent
a distinct subpopulation of mature DC with a putative par-
ticular function. The notion that the DC lineage is consti-

with cell growth and the percentage of total wells containing DC (as
determined from morphology in culture plates examined with an in-
verted microscope) were scored. For each condition, a total number of
60 wells were seeded with 100 CD34HPC/well and 600 wells were
seeded with 10 or 1 CD34HPC/well. One plate containing CD40L
negative fibroblastic L cells was seeded with 100 CD34HPC/well and
used as a negative control.

tuted of discrete subsets (28, 38–41) may be in accordance
with our in vivo finding of a DC population that pheno-
typically mirrors the CD40-derived DC. Moreover, the in
situ localization of these cells in the T cell/IDC-rich area
would also be consistent with a more mature status of the
CD40-derived DC, as suggested by lack of CD1a and the
strong expression of rel-B.
The altered CD40L from HIM patients and from gene-
targeted mice results in disrupted interactions between T cells
and DC that may be the cause of deficient T cell priming
(42), explaining perturbed T cell responses such as frequent
Cryptosporidium and Pneumocystis carinii infections (43, 44)
and susceptibility to Leishmania (45–47). Furthermore, un-
productive CD40L interactions with CD40 on monocytes
(13) or stromal cells (18) may result in decreased produc-
tion of hematopoietic growth factors, which thus may ex-
plain the frequent neutropenia associated with HIM syn-
drome.
The existence of a CD40L-dependent pathway of DC
development calls for the identification of the CD40Lϩ
partner. CD40Lϩ-activated T cells represent an obvious
candidate, a possibility that would be consistent with the
T cell secretion of hematopoietic growth factors (including
the T cell–specific IL-3), the presence of T cells in the
bone marrow (48–53), and the various hematopoietic ab-
normalities observed in T cell–deficient animals and hu-
mans (51). Recirculating CD34HPC may also encounter
CD40Lϩ mast cells (54) in peripheral tissues, thereby con-
tributing to extramedullary DC production. In keeping
with this, DC may also be generated by contact with
CD40Lϩ T cells outside bone marrow, e.g., at the sites of
inflammation where chemokines are released and may at-
tract the progenitors.
Taken together, our findings indicate that a novel CD40-
dependent pathway of DC generation may be operating
when activated CD40Lϩ T cells encounter CD34HPC.
This would provide an alternative and probably a necessar-
ily redundant DC pathway to satisfy the increased DC de-
mands required for the appropriate priming to immune
responses during pathogenic invasion. CD40–CD40L in-
teractions, thus, may represent an important link between
hematopoiesis, innate, and adaptive immunity.
