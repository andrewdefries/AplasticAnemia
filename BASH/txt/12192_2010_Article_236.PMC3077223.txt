Abstract Heat shock proteins (hsp) have been found to play
a fundamental role in the recovery from multiple stress
conditions and to offer protection from subsequent insults.
The function of hsp during stress goes beyond their
intracellular localization and chaperone role as they have
been detected outside cells activating signaling pathways.
Extracellular hsp are likely to act as indicators of the stress
conditions, priming other cells, particularly of the immune
system, to avoid the propagation of the insult. Some
extracellular hsp, for instance Hsp70, are associated with
export vesicles, displaying a robust activation of macro-
phages. We have coined the term Stress Observation System
(SOS) for the mechanism for sensing extracellular hsp, which
we propose is a form of cellular communication during stress
conditions. An enigmatic and still poorly understood process
is the mechanism for the release of hsp, which do not contain
any consensus secretory signal. The export of hsp appears to
be a very complex phenomenon encompassing different
alternative pathways. Moreover, extracellular hsp may not
come in a single flavor, but rather in a variety of physical
conditions. This review addresses some of our current
knowledge about the release and function of extracellular
hsp, in particular those associated with vesicles.

Introduction
Under normal physiological conditions, cells interact with
each other to synchronize their metabolic activity, gene
expression, and other basic cellular processes. In other words,
cells communicate to maintain homeostasis. When cells are
exposed to environmental changes, such as a variation in the
availability of nutrients, they communicate to adjust their
metabolism for the new condition. The same situation is true
when cells are confronted by stressful circumstances. Thus,
stressed cells release signals to alert the rest of the organism of
a potentially damaging situation. We have coined the term
Stress Observation System (SOS) for the mechanism respon-
sible for the sensing of stress conditions in the extracellular
environment. Some of the stress signals released by cells
correspond to heat shock proteins (hsp), which are expressed
in response to the insult. The mechanism involved in the
release of hsp is still very mysterious, and their role in cell
activation is only just beginning to be understood. This article
presents a perspective on the release and role of extracellular
hsp, in particular those hsp associated with membrane
vesicles, in the activation of the immune system to combat
injury and infection.
Expression of hsp: the universal response to stress
Almost 50 years ago, the Italian scientist Ferruccio Ritossa
discovered the heat shock response by serendipity when
one of his coworkers changed the temperature of his cell
incubator. Ritossa observed a novel change in the pattern of
Drosophila salivary gland puffs. As a good scientist, who
kept impeccable records, he related the changes in the puffs
with the higher temperatures, repeated the experiments with
the appropriate controls, and the heat shock response was

born. However, his discovery was initially rejected because,
in the words of a prominent journal editor, “it was irrelevant
to the scientific community” (Ritossa 1996), a story too
often repeated with many other novel observations that
challenge the conventional wisdom. Later, the stress
response was correlated with the expression of hsp. A large
number of hsp have been identified so far, and they are
classified according to their molecular weight into discrete
families. As is the case in many other disciplines, several
names have been given to the same hsp. A consensus
nomenclature has recently been proposed to avoid this
problem (Kampinga et al. 2009). Some hsp are present in
normal nonstress conditions, playing important roles in
different intracellular processes, among which their role as
molecular chaperones is the most recognized. In addition,
their expression is enhanced or induced after a variety of
stresses, including environmental and pathological condi-
tions. The presence of hsp is important for the recovery
from stress and protection from subsequent insults (De
Maio 1999; Giffard et al. 2008). The biology of intracel-
lular hsp during normal and stress conditions has been
summarized by a large number of reviews (Lindquist and
Craig 1988; Morimoto 1991; Bukau et al. 2006; Hartl and
Hayer-Hartl 2009). Consequently, this aspect will not be
further discussed in this article.
A new twist in the stress field is the detection of hsp outside
cells. Initially, a heat-shock-like protein was described as a
glia-axon transfer protein of the squid giant axon (Tytell et al.
1986). Independently, Hightower and Guidon (1989) found
that Hsp70 was released from cells by a mechanism that
cannot be blocked by inhibitors of classical secretory
pathways. This observation, like Ritossa’s discovery, was
initially deemed irrelevant and impossible, in spite of a large
number of appropriate controls. Thus, these early observa-
tions regarding the presence of hsp in the extracellular
environment were disregarded for many years. It was not
until another controversial finding was reported by Asea and
Calderwood (Asea et al. 2000), who found that recombinant
Hsp70 was capable of activating cells of the immune system,
that a possible role for extracellular hsp was reborn. The
results from Asea and Calderwood were disputed based on
the possibility that the activation of immune cells was due to
contamination by bacterial endotoxin (Gao and Tsan 2003;
Bausinger et al. 2002), or other agents (Bendz et al. 2008).
These worries have been ruled out by the use of recombinant
Hsp70 isolated from insect cells, nonrecombinant Hsp70,
treatment with polymyxin B, boiling, or incubation in serum-
free medium (Srivastava 1997; Vega et al. 2008; Zheng et al.
2010). Today, it is well established that Hsp70 is, indeed,
responsible for the activation of macrophages, monocytes,
dendritic cells (DC), natural killer (NK) cells, and hepato-
cytes, independently of contaminants (Asea et al. 2000;
2002; Basu et al. 2001; Vabulas et al. 2002; Gastpar et al.
2004; Wang et al. 2006; Kovalchin et al. 2006; Aneja et al.
2006; Vega et al. 2008; Galloway et al. 2008). Moreover,
extracellular hsp have been shown to act as potent
immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive molecules
depending on the circumstances by which they interact with
cells (Pockley et al. 2008).
Another controversial finding was related to the origin of
extracellular hsp. Although Hightower and Guidon (1989)
demonstrated that the release of Hsp70 was from healthy
cells, others proposed that the major source of extracellular
Hsp70 was due to cell lysis after necrosis (Basu et al.
2000). Hunter-Lavin et al. (2004) reported that Hsp70 was
released by an active mechanism independent of cell death,
confirming Hightower and Guidon’s (1989) observations.
However, these studies did not rule out the possibility that
necrosis could be an additional source of extracellular
Hsp70. In fact, we have observed that following regional
hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury in the rat, the majority
of Hsp70 in circulation is due to liver necrosis (Vazquez
and De Maio, unpublished observations). Consequently,
there are two different sources of extracellular Hsp70:
active, due to a nonconventional secretory process, and
passive, secondary to cell death and lysis. In addition to
Hsp70, other hsp have been detected outside cells, such as
Hsp60 (Merendino et al. 2010), Hsp90 (Tsutsumi and
Neckers 2007; Sidera and Patsavoudi 2008), Grp78
(Delpino and Castelli 2002; Kern et al. 2009), and Hsp27
(Liao et al. 2009). The importance of extracellular hsp has
been enlightened by the detection of Hsp70 in the serum of
patients suffering from an array of conditions (Table 1). In
addition, hsp have been found in the serum of apparently
healthy individuals (Pockley et al. 1998). The presence of
Hsp70 in circulation has also been correlated with
improved survival of critically ill patients (Pittet et al.
2002; Ziegler et al. 2005). Other extracellular hsp,
including Hsp27 (Liao et al. 2009), Hsp60 (Zhang et al.
2008), and Hsp90 (Tsutsumi and Neckers 2007) have been
additionally linked to several diseases.
Mechanisms for the export of hsp
The fact that hsp can be detected outside cells has been
puzzling, since the majority of these proteins lack the
consensus signal required for secretion via the classical
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi pathway. With the
exception of ER-resident hsp (Grp78 and Grp94), the
majority of hsp are synthesized in the cytosol and exported
to the extracellular space by an active mechanism that
cannot be blocked by typical inhibitors of the ER-Golgi
pathway, such as brefaldin A. Consequently, they are likely
to be released by an alternative mechanism, coined the
nonclassical secretory or unconventional pathway
(reviewed by Nickel and Seedorf 2008). It appears that
236 A. De Maio
the nonclassical secretory pathway is not a unique
mechanism, but rather a collection of alternative passage-
ways, which have as a common denominator the exclusion
from the ER/Golgi compartment. The most prominent
molecules secreted by the unconventional pathway are
interleukin (IL)-1α and -1β, which are apparently released
by several possible mechanisms (Eder 2008). Similarly to
IL-1, the release of Hsp70 outside cells has been reported
via different mechanisms. A lysosome–endosome pathway
has been proposed (Mambula and Calderwood 2006). In
this process, Hsp70 is translocated into lysomes, where the
protein is spared from degradation and transported to the
exterior of the cell via the endocytic process. Indeed, the
presence of Hsp70 in the lumen of lysomes has been reported
previously (Nylandsted et al. 2004). The translocation of
Hsp70 into lysosomes has been proposed via an ATP-
binding cassette (ABC) transport-like system (Mambula and
Calderwood 2006). Hsp70 has also been proposed to be
released by secretory-like granules (Evdonin et al. 2006). We
have argued that there is another mechanism for the export of
Hsp70, which is mediated by the insertion of the protein into
the membrane of export vesicles (Vega et al. 2008).
Another surprising and controversial finding has been
the interaction of Hsp70 with membranes. Initially, Alder et
al. (1990) detected currents after the addition of Hsp70 to
unilamellar lipid vesicles. Ten years later, we showed that
Hsc70 was capable of integrating into an artificial lipid
bilayer, opening cationic conductance channels, which were
very stable and regulated by adenosine triphosphate/
diphosphate (ATP/ADP) (Arispe and De Maio 2000).
Similarly, Hsp70 was also found to open ion conductance
pathways in artificial lipid bilayers (Vega et al. 2008).
These observations have been expanded by other studies in
which both Hsc70 and Hsp70 were capable of inducing
liposome aggregation in a time-, concentration-, and
nucleotide-dependent manner (Arispe et al. 2002). More-
over, it was found that the specificity of Hsp70 and Hsc70
for lipids was highly related to the presence of phosphati-
dylserine (PS) within membranes (Arispe et al. 2004;
Schilling et al. 2009). New observations also revealed that
Hsp70-induced PS-liposome aggregation could be en-
hanced by the coaddition of monosialotetrahexosylganglio-
side (GM1) and cholesterol (Fig. 1). Other sphingolipids,
such as globotriaosylceramide, have also been reported to
enhance Hsp70 insertion into membranes (Gehrmann et al.
2008; Sugawara et al. 2009). Recently, the specificity of
Hsp70 for other lipids, such as anionic phospholipid
bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, has been reported
(Nylandsted et al. 2004). In contrast, liposomes made of
phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, or phos-
phatidylinositol could not sustain Hsp70 membrane inser-
tion and liposome aggregation, confirming that the presence
of PS is fundamental for Hsp70 insertion (Arispe et al.
2004). Although both Hsc70 and Hsp70 channels showed
the same specificity, their conductance was not identical
(Arispe and De Maio 2000; Vega et al. 2008). Likewise, the
kinetics of Hsc70- or Hsp70-induced liposome aggregation
were different (Arispe et al. 2002), suggesting that these
two protein are, indeed, functionally different, at least in
their interaction with membranes. The stability observed in
Hsp70/Hsc70 channels is remarkable for a protein that does
not contain any consensus hydrophobic domain that can
explain membrane insertion. In other words, the incorpora-
tion of Hsp70/Hsc70 into membranes cannot be predicted
on the basis of their amino acid sequences. The mechanism
for the insertion of Hsp70 within the lipid membrane is not
known, but it is likely dependent on membrane fluidity
(Horvath et al. 2008). We have proposed that Hsp70
membrane insertion may be related to the flipping/flopping
of PS across the lipid bilayer. It is also possible that Hsp70/
Hsc70 oligomerizes prior to or during membrane insertion,
which is likely necessary for ion channel formation. Hsc70
has been shown to form low-order oligomers (Schlossman
et al. 1984; Gao et al. 1996; Fouchaq et al. 1999). The C
terminus end of Hsp70/Hsc70 displays a β-sheet structure,
which may act as an oligomerization center. Indeed, other

proteins with similar β-sheet structures, such as annexin,
amyloid, and amylin, have been shown to form ion
channels in artificial lipid bilayers (Rojas et al. 1992;
Arispe et al. 1993, 1996).
The discovery of Hsp70 insertion into membranes
provided an explanation for another divisive topic, the
presence of hsp on the cell surface. Initially, Ferrarini et al.
(1992) detected Hsp90 and, to a lesser extent, Hsp70 on the
surface of several tumor cell lines. This observation was
followed by a more extensive characterization of Hsp70 on
the surface of transformed cells by Multhoff et al. (1995).
These discoveries remained controversial for many years
despite a large number of publications confirming this
phenomenon (reviewed by Multhoff and Hightower 1996;
Multhoff 2007). Several lines of evidence suggested that
Hsp70 was not simply associated to a membrane protein,
but rather inserted into the plasma membrane. The strongest
argument for this observation was that only an antibody
that recognized a small epitope on the C terminus end of
the molecule was capable of detecting Hsp70 on the cell
surface (Botzler et al. 1998). In addition, Hsp70 within the
plasma membrane was found resistant to acid or basic washes
(Vega et al. 2008; Gehrmann et al. 2008). Interestingly, the
protein within the cell surface was found resistant to
solubilization by nonionic detergents (Vega et al. 2008),
suggesting that the protein may be localized within
detergent-resistant microdomains (DRM), or lipid rafts,
which are rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids (Brown and
London 2000). Indeed, Hsp70 has been detected within the
DRM fraction isolated from cells (Triantafilou et al. 2002;
Broquet et al. 2003; Hunter-Lavin et al. 2004; Chen et al.
2005; Wang et al. 2006; Vega et al. 2008). These
observations are supported by our findings demonstrating
an increase in aggregation by addition of cholesterol and/or
GM1 to PS liposomes (Fig. 1). The presence of Hsp70 and
other hsp on the cell surface has been widely reported by
many investigators under different physiological or patho-
logical conditions (Table 2). Moreover, the observation that
Hsp70 can be inserted into the plasma membrane opens the
possibility that this association may be the gateway for the
release of the protein to the extracellular space. In fact,
Hsp70-containing vesicles, which were derived from the
plasma membrane, have been detected in the extracellular
medium (Gastpar et al. 2005; Vega et al. 2008; Chalmin et al.
2010). Hsp70 was found on the surface of these vesicles,
presenting many of the characteristics of the protein within
the plasma membrane, such as insolubility by Triton X-100
(Vega et al. 2008).
Another alternative mechanism for the export of hsp
proteins may be related to the release of cargo within
extracellular vesicles. Indeed, several hsp have been detected
within extracellular vesicles (Table 3). It is very likely that
cytosolic proteins, including hsp, are trapped or actively
transported into the lumen of extracellular vesicles and are
consequently released into the outer cellular space. Alter-
ations in the vesicle integrity may result in the release of the
cargo into circulation. A potential example for this mecha-
nism is related to the release of high-mobility group box 1
(HMGB-1), which is not secreted by the ER-Golgi pathway
(Gardella et al. 2002). HMGB-1 has been reported in
extracellular vesicles derived from stimulated human epithe-
lial cells (Liu et al. 2006). Thus, it is possible that HMBG-1
is packed into extracellular vesicles that are released into
circulation, which eventually release their cargo, including
this important inflammatory agent (Yang et al. 2005). This
possibility matches the initial observation about the detection

prepared with or without GM1 (20 μg/ml), cholesterol (20% mol/mol)
or a combination of both. Liposomes were incubated with Hsp70
(10 μg/ml) in 40 mM histidine–HCl, pH 6, 300 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2 at 25°C, and the change in absorbance produced

of HMBG-1 in circulation during late sepsis (Wang et al.
1999). Similarly, exocytosis of endolysosome-related
vesicles has also been proposed for the release of IL-1β
(Andrei et al. 1999; MacKenzie et al. 2001).
Cell communication via extracellular vesicles
There are several ways that cells can communicate with each
other. The most common is via soluble molecules that are
placed in the extracellular environment and interact with
adjacent or distant cells via specific receptors. The typical
examples of this type of communication are hormones and
cytokines. Cells that are placed together can also communi-
cate via surface contact molecules, such as adhesion proteins,
which have been coined “cellular synapses” (Ahmed and
Xiang 2010). Moreover, cells in close proximity can
exchange surface molecules by the direct transfer of
membrane portions, which is known as trogocytosis, or by

membrane tethers or nanotubes (Davis 2007). In addition,
adjacent cells can exchange low-molecular-weight metabo-
lites by passing them from cell to cell via gap junctions (De
Maio et al. 2002). An alternative mechanism for cellular
communication could be mediated by membrane vesicles
released by one cell and captured by another. These vesicles
contain surface molecules, lipids, and cargo, which can be of
different natures, including proteins, nucleic acids, carbohy-
drates, and small molecules.
The importance of cellular communication via vesicles is
that they contain a large number of molecules in a small
volume. Thus, every target cell can be hit at the same time
by a great number of recognition or signaling molecules,
which is likely to be more effective than the activity of
individual components in solution. For example, activation
of macrophages by Hsp70 is increasingly elevated when the
protein is associated with vesicles, more than 250-fold
higher than the same concentration of the hsp in solution
(Vega et al. 2008). This robust effect is likely due to the
high concentration of Hsp70 within the vesicle. In fact, the
concentration of a ligand within a 100-nm vesicle is
theoretically calculated in the millimolar range, which is
much larger than the circulating concentration of any
hormone or other cellular activator agent. Moreover, the
multiplicity of different molecules per vesicle adds a
synergistic effect for the information transmitted to the
target cell. In other words, different components of the
vesicle could simultaneously activate various cellular path-
ways. The second advantage of communication via vesicles
is that they can travel long distances before breaking down
and releasing their cargo, which, indeed, protects the lumen
components from factors that may affect their stability. The
final stage for this mechanism of communication requires
that extracellular vesicles are specifically recognized by
target cells. Thus, it could be postulated that these vesicles
interact with specific cells via surface molecules or
receptors. In other words, surface molecules on the vesicles
could act as recognition signals (zip codes) that direct the
vesicles to specific receptors on cellular targets. These
surface molecules could be directly involved in the
activation of cells, or this role could be mediated by other
components within the vesicles, such as cargo molecules.
The process of vesicle interaction with the target cells may
require endocytosis or membrane fusion.
Extracellular vesicles have different origins
The presence of extracellular vesicles has been known for a
long time. However, the terminology, as in any emerging
field, has been confusing, hindering the understanding of
the role and origin of these vesicles. Extracellular vesicles
have been coined exosomes, ectosomes, and microparticles,
among many other names. Exosomes are small export
vesicles initially derived from the plasma membrane, but by
a mechanism involving endocytosis (Thery et al. 2009). In
contrast, microparticles and ectosomes are derived directly
from the plasma membrane by the formation of membrane
protuberances. Initially, microparticles were described as
the “dust” released by platelets (Wolf 1967). Since it was
not initially clear whether or not they contained a
membrane component, microparticles was an appropriate
term. Today, it is known that they are encapsulated by a
membrane, derived from the plasma membrane, and they
may be very large, reaching diameters of up to 1,000 nm
(Hugel et al. 2005; Meziani et al. 2008). Consequently, they
are not properly microparticles, but rather macrovesicles. In
contrast, ectosomes, which are derived from the plasma
membrane, are smaller, about 50–100 nm in diameter

(Thery et al. 2009). The composition of exosomes,
ectosomes, and microparticles is likely to be different.
Density in sucrose gradients has been used as a criterion to
differentiate them. However, it is unclear whether exosomes
and ectosomes indeed have different density. Since the
common approach to isolate extracellular vesicles is by
differential centrifugation, it has been very difficult to
physically separate the various types of vesicles, making it
complicated to determine their specific components or
markers.
Exosomes were first described as being derived during
the differentiation of reticulocytes as part of a mechanism to
release unwanted molecules (Harding et al. 1983; Pan et al.
1985). They are derived by a process in which the plasma
membrane is internalized by endocytosis, followed by the
formation of late endosomes. In this last compartment, the
membrane of the endocytic vesicle is invaginated inward
and sealed, resulting in vesicles within larger vesicles,
called multivesicular bodies (MVB). Then, MVB fuse with
the plasma membrane, liberating the internal vesicles
(exosomes), 40–100 nm, which are then free in the
extracellular environment (Johnstone 2006; Thery et al.
2009). The major characteristic of this process is that the
vesicles that are released have the same topology as the
plasma membrane. However, not all plasma membrane
components are present in exosomes, suggesting a level of
specificity for their assembly. Exosomes have been found to
contain transferrin receptor, tetraspanins (CD9, CD63,
CD81, and CD82), and Glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI) anchored glycoproteins, such as acethylcholinester-
ase. In addition, exosomes are also rich in cholesterol and
sphingolipids (Simpson et al. 2008; Thery et al. 2009).
These observations suggest that DRM or lipid rafts are
present in these extracellular vesicles (de Gassart et al.
2003). Exosomes also contain some members of the
endocytosis pathway, such as Rabs, which have been
implicated in exosome formation (Savina et al. 2002;
Ostrowski et al. 2010). Moreover, the release of exosomes
is apparently calcium-dependent (Savina et al. 2003). Since
exosomes are made by invaginations of the endosomal
membrane, they pinch out some cytosolic molecules. In
fact, a protein that has been detected in many exosome
preparations is Hsc70. Originally, it was speculated that
Hsc70 was present because of its high cytosolic abundance
(approximately 107
molecules/cell). However, other pro-
teins present in large concentrations in the cytosol have not
been detected in exosomes. Thus, the theory is that the
composition of exosome cargo is also very specific.
Exosomes have been observed derived from a large number
of cells in different physiological conditions (Simpson et al.
2008), including B cells (Raposo et al. 1996), T cells
(Blanchard et al. 2002), DC (Zitvogel et al. 1998), macro-
phages (Bhatnagar et al. 2007), and mast cells (Raposo et al.
1997). They have been also associated with an important role
in cancer and pathogen biology (Schorey and Bhatnagar
2008; O’Neill and Quah 2008).
In contrast to exosomes, microparticles, or ectosomes,
are derived directly from the plasma membrane without the
involvement of the endocytic pathway. The mechanism
implies the formation of membrane protuberances or blebs,
which at critical sizes are sealed and released (Hugel et al.
2005; Meziani et al. 2008). These vesicles are also likely to
contain plasma membrane components and several cytosol-
ic factors that are imported into the emerging vesicle.
Interestingly, ectosomes and microparticles are also very
rich in lipid raft components (Hugel et al. 2005; Lopez et al.
2005). In fact, it has been proposed that microparticles are
derived from lipid rafts (del Conde et al. 2005). Similarly
with exosomes, microparticles, or ectosomes, are not
absolute replicas of the plasma membrane, suggesting a
level of selectivity in their formation. These vesicles also
likely require actin polymerization for their formation.
Consequently, it is possible that F-actin is present within
them. As mentioned above, microparticles tend to be large
(100–1000 nm) and can be isolated by low g force and
characterized by flow cytometry (Thery et al. 2009;
Gelderman and Simak 2008). Microparticles have been
shown to display immunosuppressive function (Sadallah
et al. 2008), and they have also been implicated in
angiogenesis (Mostefai et al. 2008). Microparticles have
been proposed as markers of endothelium dysfunction
(Horstman et al. 2004) and other conditions (Smalley and
Ley 2008; Meziani et al. 2008). Small vesicles, which are
commonly called ectosomes, might also be released
through budding of the plasma membrane. Thus, size is
not the main criteria to classify extracellular vesicles as
exosomes or ectosomes. Therefore, the term exosomes
should be restricted to vesicles that are derived via MVB.
In other words, not all 5- to 100-nm vesicles detected
outside cells are exosomes. Microparticles, ectosomes, and
exosomes are different than vesicles derived from apopto-
tic cells. During cell death, there is a significant bleed of
the plasma membrane and a release of vesicles, which
have been coined apoptotic blebs or apoptotic vesicles.
These vesicles are likely part of the cell shrinking process
during apoptosis (Hristov et al. 2004). Apoptotic blebs
probably contain a large variety of cellular components
(membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear) without any specific-
ity. They are possibly of different sizes and denser than
exosomes (Thery et al. 2009). Their biological role, if any,
remains to be established.
Extracellular vesicles and the SOS
Cells also secrete extracellular or export vesicles in
response to stress, which could be specifically coined
Extracellular hsp, cellular export vesicles, and SOS 241
Stress Cellular Vesicles. The idea is that these extracellular
vesicles contain particular molecules, such as hsp, whose
expression is induced during the stress. These extracellular
vesicles are recognized by other cell types, in particular
cells of the immune system, as part of an assessment of the
stress conditions. Particular components of extracellular
vesicles may act as signals to activate a preemptive
response in distant cells. We have coined this phenomenon
the SOS. It is likely that the specific cellular response
depends on the composition of extracellular vesicles. The
presence of extracellular vesicles has been observed in a large
number of disease conditions (Table 4). For example,
extracellular vesicles that were isolated from the plasma of
septic patients induced myocardial dysfunction in isolated
rabbit hearts and rat papillary muscle preparations (Azevedo
et al. 2007). The incidence of aortic valve stenosis has been
associated with the presence of extracellular vesicles derived
from platelets after high shear stress. These extracellular
vesicles could further activate leukocytes and monocytes to
produce more vesicles, resulting in endothelial cell injury
(Diehl et al. 2008; Ahn et al. 2008). Extracellular vesicles
derived from macrophages infected with intracellular patho-
gens were found to activate uninfected macrophages by a
Toll-like receptor (Tlr) and myeloid differentiation factor 88
(My88) mechanism. They also induced polymorphonuclear
leukocyte recruitment in lungs after intranasal delivery
(Bhatnagar et al. 2007). Export vesicles isolated in the
bronchoalveolar fluid of allergen-tolerized mice were
reported to prevent an allergic reaction (Prado et al. 2008).
Extracellular vesicles have been purified from different
sources, including epididymal fluid and seminal plasma
(Gatti et al. 2005), broncoalveolar fluid (Admyre et al.
2003), amniotic fluid (Keller et al. 2007), blood (Caby et al.
2005), and urine (Keller et al. 2007).
Hsp have been detected in preparations of extracellular
vesicles from different cell types as mentioned before
(Table 3). Moreover, these hsp-containing vesicles have been
found to have a biological function. For example, vesicles
containing Hsp70 on their surface displayed a robust and
specific activation of macrophages, which was more robust
than the same concentration of recombinant Hsp70 in
solution (Vega et al. 2008). Hsp70-positive extracellular

vesicles were also found to stimulate the cytotoxic capacity
of NK cells (Gastpar et al. 2005). Vesicles containing Hsp70
isolated from mycobacteria-infected cells induced an inflam-
matory response in macrophages (O’Neill and Quah 2008).
In contrast, Hsp70-membrane-associated vesicles could
induce an immunosuppressive effect (Chalmin et al. 2010).
Thus, it is possible that Hsp70 within export vesicles plays
different roles depending on composition, vesicle source, and
cell target. The mechanism for the recognition of extracel-
lular (stress) vesicles by target cells is not known. However,
it is likely that they are specifically detected by the presence
of surface signals. One possibility is that extracellular
vesicles lose the lipid asymmetry typical of the plasma
membrane (Zwaal et al. 2005), exposing PS moieties on the
surface of the vesicle. Macrophages may engulf these
vesicles via surface receptors that recognize this lipid, such
as Tim-4 (Miyanishi et al. 2007) and BAI1 (Park et al.
2007). These receptors have been investigated in the context
of uptake of apoptotic cells, which display PS on the surface
as part of the cell death process. If extracellular vesicles are
recognized by the presence of PS, it is likely that other
components within the vesicle may be responsible for a
secondary effect, such as the presence of Hsp70 (Fig. 2).
Whether this effect occurs concomitantly via a surface
receptor or during an endocytic process remains to be
established. The other possibility is that molecules on the
surface of extracellular vesicles are specifically recognized
by receptors on the target cell (Fig. 2). For example, several
receptors have been proposed to recognize Hsp70, including
Tlr 2 and 4 (Asea et al. 2002), CD14 (Asea et al. 2000),
CD91 (Basu et al. 2001), CD40 (Becker et al. 2002; Wang et
al. 2001), and scavenger receptors (Theriault et al. 2006;
Facciponte et al. 2007). However, some of these observa-
tions have been controversial (Binder 2009). Whether these
molecules are involved in the recognition of Hsp70-positive
vesicles remains to be established. It could also be speculated
that the presence of different stress signals of the vesicles
may be recognized by various cell types or may trigger
different responses.
Concluding remarks
The biology related to extracellular hsp is in exponential
growth, leading to the discovery of more processes activated
by these molecules. The multiple roles that have been
associated with hsp, inside and outside cells, are remarkable.
So far, we have gained a great deal of knowledge regarding
the mechanisms for hsp export, which are likely to comprise
multiple pathways. Similarly, it is evident that extracellular
hsp come in different flavors, such as membrane-bound and
membrane-free, each one with a specific systemic function.
It could be envisioned that more mechanistic details for the
release and function of hsp will be discovered within the next
few years. It is amazing how far these disregarded initial
discoveries have driven research on the stress response.
However, we can expect more controversy to continue to
arise, since it has been a common feature of this field.
