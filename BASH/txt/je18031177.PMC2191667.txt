Summary
To assess the effects of interferon 3/(IFN-y) on very primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells,
CD342+CD38- human bone marrow cells were isolated and cultured in a two-stage culture
system, consisting of a primary liquid culture phase followed by a secondary semisolid colony
assay. CD342+CD38 - cells needed at least the presence of interleukin 3 (IL-3) and kit ligand
(KL) together with either IL-1, IL-6, or granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the
primary liquid phase in order to proliferate and differentiate into secondary colony-forming cells
(CFC). Addition of IFN-7 to the primary liquid cultures inhibited cell proliferation and generation
of secondaryCFC in a dose-dependentway. This was a direct effect since it was also seen in primary
single cell cultures of CD342 +CD38- cells. The proliferation of more mature CD34 +CD38 +
cells, however, was not inhibited by IFN-7, demonstrating for the first time that IFN-7 is a
specific and direct hematopoietic stem cell inhibitor. IFN-7, moreover, preserves the viability
of CD342+CD38 - cells in the absence of other cytokines. IFN-7 could, therefore, play a role
in the protection of the stem cell compartment from exhaustion in situations of hematopoietic
stress and may be useful as stem cell protecting agent against chemotherapy for cancer.
D ifferentiation and proliferation of primitive hematopoi-
etic progenitor cells is tightly regulated by colony-
stimulating factors (CSF) and by cytokines that act in syn-
ergy with CSF to stimulate the development of progenitor
cellsinto mature cells (1). Recently severalreports have demon-
strated direct stimulatory effects of IFN-7 on hematopoietic
progenitor cells in synergy with other hemoregulatory
cytokines such as IL-3 (2-4), GM-CSF (2-4), c-kit ligand
(KL) (5) and the combination of IL-3 and erythropoietin (epo)
(6). Moreover, IFN-7 stimulates the expansion of progen-
itor cells induced by IL-3, IL-6, IL-1, epo, and KL (7) and
the growth of acute myeloblastic leukemia cells supported
by IL-3 (6). The growth of G-CSF-responsive granulocytic
progenitors however is directly inhibited by IFN-7 (4). The
direct effects of IFN-7 on very primitive progenitor and stem
cells, however, have not been reported thus far. Very primi-
tive human hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells are charac-
terizedby a high expression of CD34 and the absence of CD38
expression (CD342+ CD38- cells). Upon differentiation and
lineage commitment, the expression of CD38 increases while
the expression of CD34 decreases (CD34 +CD38 + cells) (8,
9). To study the effects of IFN-7 on the early stages of the
development of these very primitive human progenitor cells,
we used a precolony-forming cell (pre-CFC) assay (10, 11)
where the effects of the presence of IFN-'y in primary cul-
tures of CD342+CD38 - cells on the output of secondary
CFCs was studied. Here we report that IFN-7 is a potent
and selective direct inhibitor of CD342+CD38 - and not of
CD34+CD38 + cells. These findings indicate that IFN-7
may play a role in protecting the stem cell compartment from
exhaustion in situations of hematopoietic stress and that IFN-7
could be useful for the specific protection of hematopoietic
stem cells against chemotherapy for cancer.

of anti-CD34. FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglob-
ulin F(ab')5fragments (RAM) were purchased from Dako (Glos-
trup, Denmark). PE-conjugated anti-CD38 (IgG1) antibodies as
well as isotype-specific control antibodies were purchased from
Becton Dickinson (Erembodegem, Belgium). Monoclonal neu-
tralizing anti-IFN-'t antibody (clone GZ-4, IgG1K)and isotype-
matched irrelevantcontrol antibody (antidigoxigenin, IgG1K)were
kindlydonatedbyDr. M. Kubbies(BoehringerMannheim GmbH).
Recombinant human IFN-3, (specific activity 2 x 107 U/mg),
II.6 (108U/mg), and I1.1 (5 x 107 U/mg) were obtained from
Boehringer Mannheim GmbH. Recombinant human G-CSF,GM-
CSF, and 11,3were a kind gift of Dr. S. C. Clark (Genetics Insti-
tute, Cambridge, MA), while recombinant human KL was kindly
donated by Dr. M. Kubbies. Erythropoietin (epo) was purchased
from Cilag (105U/rag; Brussels, Belgium).
Cell Sorting. Bone marrow cellswere incubated at 107cells/ml
with 43A1supernatant in a 1:10dilution for 20.min at 4~ washed
twice in IMDM containing 2% FCS, incubated with fluorescei-
nated RAM (1/50 dilution) for 20 min at 4~ After washing the
cells twice in IMDM + 2% FCS, they were sorted on a FACStar
Plus| cellsorter (Becton Dickinson) equipped with an air-cooled
argon ion laser (ILTmodel 5500A; Ion LaserTechnology,SaltLake
City, UT). Cells with a low to medium forward scatter and a low
side scatter, a highly positive green (CD34) fluorescence, and an
orange (CD38) fluorescence signal lower than the mean fluores-
cence of cells labeled with control antibody + 2 standard devia-
tions were retained as CD342+CD38 - cells; cells with an orange
fluorescenceabovethis threshold were retained as CD34 §CD38 §
ceils. Purities were always >95%.
Pre-CFU Assay. Primary liquid cultures were performed in
duplicatein 96-weUfiat-bottomedplatesat 100cells/wellin IMDM,
10% FCS,and combinations ofthe following recombinant human
cytokines: 100 ng/ml 11,1,200 U/ml 11,6, 100 ng/ml G-CSF, 30
U/ml I1,3, 100 ng/ml KL, and varying concentrations of IFN-3,.
After 14 d of primary culture, the number of cells in each well
was counted using an inverted microscope at 250x magnification,
after which the cellswere harvested, washed three times in IMDM
+ 10% FCS, and plated in secondary methylcellulose cultures
(0.9%) supplemented with 20% FCS, 1% BSA, 10-5 M 2-mer-
captoethanol,30 U/ml I1,3, 100ng/ml G-CSF,100ng/ml GM-CSF,
and 2 U/ml epo, which were found to be optimal concentrations
for colony formation in preliminary experiments. These cultures
were microscopicallyscoredforcolony formation after 14and after
21 d of culture at 37~ in 7.5% O5 and 5% CO2 in a fully hu-
midified incubator.
To ascertain that the effects of IFN-3, in these experiments
were direct, the sameexperiments were performed at a single cell
level. CD342+CD38 - cells were sorted at 1 cell/well in 96-well
V-bottomed plates (two plates per cytokine combination). In test
sorts using fluorescent microbeads, on average<2% of the wells
contained no beads and no wells were detected which contained
more than one bead. Eachwell contained 100/~1ofculture medium
consisting of IMDM, 10% FCS, 11,1,11,6, I1,3, and KL (concen-
trations as in the primary cultures described above)and either no
IFN-'y or IFN-3' at 105U/ml. After 14 d of culture (37~ 7.5%
05, 5% CO2 in a fully humidifiedincubator), the number of wells
where growth had occurred (primary colonies) was scored using
an invertedmicroscope,the primary colonieswereharvested,washed
four times, and individually plated in secondary methylcellulose
cultures as described above. Secondary colony formation was as-
sessedafter 14 and 21 d of secondary culture. Parallelexperiments
were performed using CD34+CD38 + cells (which constitute the
remainder of the CD34 + cells).
In a number of experiments, the cellswere first cultured in the
presenceor absenceof IFN-3' without any other cytokines for 4 d
in 96-weUflat-bottomedplates,afterwhich the number ofremaining
cellswascountedbyphasecontrastmicroscopy(250x magnification).
Shrunken, dull-appearing cellswith a ruffledcellmembrane were
considered to be dead and were not counted. The cells were then
harvested, washed, and cultured in liquid culture medium for 14d
in the presence of KL (100 ng/ml), 11,1 (100 ng/ml), IL-6 (200
U/ml), and I1,3 (30 U/ml). After 14 d of culture the cells were
harvested,washed, and plated out in secondarymethylcellulosecul-
tures as described above.
Statistics. In all experiments, the Student's t test for paired
samples was used.
Results
Cytokine Requirements of CD342+CD38 - Cells. The
CD342+CD38 - fraction comprises "~,0.01-0.05% of human
bone marrow cells and 1-5% of the CD34 + cells (not
shown). These cells hardly form any colonies when plated
directly in semisolid methylcellulose cultures in the presence
of combinations of CSF such as IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and
epo (cloning efficiency<2%, results not shown). However,
when cultured in primary liquid cultures for 14 d in the pres-
ence of combinations of multiple early acting factors (for a
review, see reference 1), the CD342 +CD38- cells give rise
to committed progenitor cells which do form colonies in sec-
ondary methylcellulosecultures (CFC). To generate secondary
CFC, CD342+CD38- require at least the presence of IL-3,
KL, and either IL-1, IL-6, or G-CSF in the primary liquid
cultures (Fig. 1). No secondary CFC were generated in the
absence of either IL-3 (not shown) or KL (Fig. 1), and only
few secondary CFC were produced in the presence of IL-3
and KL without any other synergistic factors in the primary
liquid cultures (Fig. 1). The secondarycolonies generated from
CD342+CD38 - cells were mostly myeloid with <2% of
erythroid or mixed erythroid/myeloid colonies. Most of the
myeloid colonies consisted of large macrophages. Addition
of epo to the primary cultures had no effect on the number
nor on the morphology of the secondary colonies (not shown).
When the secondary cultures were scored at day 21, secondary
high proliferative potential CFC (HPP-CFC, defined as mac-
roscopic colonies of >2 mm diameter with a dense center,
consisting mostly of large macrophage-like cells) were noted
(see Fig. 3). These HPP-CFC are believed to arise from more
primitive progenitor cells than other colony types (13, 14).
IFN-y Inhibits the Proliferation and Differentiation of
CD342+CD38 - Cells. When IFN-3, was added to the pri-
mary liquid cultures of CD342 +CD38- cells (100 cells/well)
stimulated by cytokine combinations that induce prolifera-
tion of CD342+ CD38- cells (see Fig. 1), cell proliferation,
generation of secondary CFC, and of secondary HPP-CFC
were profoundly inhibited in a dose-dependent way, with near
complete inhibition occurring at 5,000 U/ml (Figs. 2 and
3). The inhibitory effect of IFN-3, was less pronounced, but
still statistically significant, in cultures stimulated by IL-3+KL
(Fig. 2). The inhibitory effect of IFN-y was blocked by adding
neutralizing antibodies to human IFN-'y to the cultures (Fig.
3), but not by adding isotype-matched irrelevant control an-
tibodies.

cells(pooledresultsoffiveindependentexperimentsperformedin duplicate).
To see whether this inhibition was a direct effect of IFN-%
primary liquid cultures were performed at a single cell level,
by sorting CD342*CD38 - cells at one cell/well in 96-well
plates in the presence of IL-3, IL-1, IL-6, and KL with or
without IFN-3'. The wells in which growth had occurred
as assessedby microscopic evaluation (primary colonies) were
picked up, washed, and plated individually in methylcellu-
lose cultures supplemented with IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and
epo. In these single cell culture experiments, the presence of
iFN-3~ in the primary cultures inhibited the total number
of secondary CFC to the same extent as in experiments where
CD342+CD38 - cells were cultured at 100 cells/well (-67.5
_+ 13.7% vs. -69.1 +_ 4.3%, respectively, at a concentra-
tion of 1,000 U/ml, n = 4), demonstrating that the inhibi-
tory effect of IFN-3' on the proliferation of CD342 +CD38-
cells is a direct one. IFN-3~ primarily inhibited the number
of CD342+CD38 - cells forming primary colonies (Table 1,
top), whereas the number of secondary CFCs per individual
primary colony was inhibited to a lesser extent (Table 1,
bottom).

IFN-'f Does Not Inhibit More Mature CD34+CD38 +
Cells. The same single cell culture experiments were per-
formed using CD34+CD38 § bone marrow cells, which
constitute the remainder of CD34 § cells (Table 1). Strik-
ingly, only 6.7 _+ 2.5% of the primary colonies generated
from this population in the presence of IL-3, IL-1, IL-6, and
KL contained secondary CFCs (compared with 95.3 _+2.4%
of the primary colonies derived from CD342 +CD38- cells,
/~ = 0.0001). This indicates that this culture system allows
a very sharp functional distinction of very primitive
CD342+CD38 - cells from more mature CD34+CD38 +
cells. In contrast to the effects of IFN-y on CD342 +CD38-
cells, addition of IFN-y to primary cultures of CD34 +
CD38 + cells had no effect on the number of primary colo-
nies nor on the number of secondary CFC (Table1). Moreover,
IFN-y did not inhibit colony formation in single cell methyl-
cellulose cultures of CD34+CD38 + cells supported by epo,
IL-1, IL-6, KL, and IL-3 (mean cloning e~ciency 30.8 -+
2.6% without and 27.5 + 3.2% with IFN-qr at 103 U/ml
respectively, n = 6, p = 0.35). Taken together, these data
indicate that IFN-'r acts as a highly selective and direct in-
hibitor of the proliferation and differentiationof very primi-
tive CD342+CD38 - cells and not of more mature
CD34 +CD38 + cells.
IFN-7 Stimulates the Survival of CD342+CD38 - Cells. To
see whether preincubation of CD342+CD38 - cells in IFN-3r
also affects their subsequent capacity to generate secondary
CFC, CD34z+CD38- cells where first cultured for 4 d ei-
ther in culture medium (IMDM, 10% FCS) or in culture

and a pre-CFC assaywas performed asdescribed above. When,
after 4 d of preculture in either medium without cytokines
or medium containing IFN-3' (103 U/ml) the cells were
washed and cultured for another 14 d in the presence of IL-3,
KL, IL-6, and IL-1, significantlymore secondary CFC were
recovered from the ceils that had been precultured for 4 d
in the presence of IFN-3~than in the absence of IFN-3~(mean
difference +117 _+ 26%, p = 0.02, n = 4). This effect is
due to a survival-enhancing effect of IFN-% since significantly

more morphologicallyintact cells, as determined by counting
the cells in the culture wells by phase contrast microscopy,
were recovered after 4 d of culture with IFN-3' than after
4 d of culture in medium without cytokines (68.5 + 2.9%
and 31 _+ 4.8%, respectively, of the input cell number, p
= 0.0008, n = 5, 103 U/ml IFN-3,). Both the effect on cell
number and on the capacity to generate secondary CFC
reached a plateau at an IFN-3~concentration of 50 U/ml (not
shown), i.e., at a 2-log lower concentration than the concen-
tration at which complete inhibition of proliferation and
differentiationofpre-CFC was noted (seeFig. 2). These data
show that IFN-'y promotes the survival of CD342+CD38 -
cells and that preincubation in IFN-'y does not inhibit their
subsequent proliferative capacity.
Discussion
The assay used in this report identifies very primitive
precursors of CFC, since CD342+CD38 - cells that do not
form colonies in semisolid media are stimulated to differen-
tiate in suspension culture into CFC. CD342 +CD38- cells,
which, according to our data also contain precursors of HPP-
CFC which are considered to be very early progenitors (13,
14), are known to be among the most primitive hematopoi-
etic precursors (8, 9). The fact that in the secondarycultures,
mostly colonies containing macrophages were recoveredmight
indicate that a less primitive cell is detected here. However,
many authors have shown that HPP-CFC also consist of
mostly large macrophage-like cells (13, 14). Moreover and
in accordance with our data, Lu et al. (15) showed that colo-
nies with a high replating capacity generated from primitive
CD343 + cord blood cells consisted mostly of large macro-
phage-like ceils. The development of colonies originating from
very early (stem) cells in these in vitro assaysthus seems to
be biased towards the macrophage lineage. Since this is a two-
stage culture system, this assay allows the characterization
of the direct effects of IFN-'y on the early phases of the devel-
1180 INF-3"SelectivelyInhibitsVery
opment of primitive progenitor cells (from pre-CFC to CFC),
without interference of any effects of IFN-y on the terminal
stages of differentiation(from CFC to mature cell), on which
IFN-3' has been shown to have stimulatory effects (2-6).
This report for the first time identifies IFN-3' as a direct
bidirectional regulator of hematopoiesis whose inhibitory
effects display a very strong specificity for very primitive pro-
genitor and stem cells, as evidenced by the direct inhibition
by IFN-'y of the early stages of proliferation and differentia-
tion of very primitive CD342 §CD38- cells, but not of more
mature CD34+CD38 + cells. The smaller decrease in sec-
ondary colony formation induced by IFN-3, in primary cul-
tures of CD342+CD38- cells supported by IL-3 +KL (Fig.
2) might be interpreted in the same context, since the
CD342 +CD38- cells stimulated by this cytokine combina-
tion are probably less primitive than cells which require a
combination of three or four cytokinesin order to proliferate.
These effects are moreover undoubtedly direct since they were
also seen in single cell culture experiments.
A number of recent reports, including one from our labo-
ratory (4), demonstrated direct stimulatory effects of IFN-3,
on human hematopoietic progenitor cells in synergy with
IL-3 and GM-CSF (2-4). Some reports even suggested that
IFN-3' has a selective stimulatory effect on more primitive
progenitors in the murine system (5). However, in most of
these reports the effects of IFN-qr on progenitor cells respon-
sive to single CSF was assessed, indicating that more mature
progenitor cells were studied. We show in this report that
IFN-3, does not inhibit, nor stimulate the proliferation and
differentiation of more mature CD34+CD38 + population
stimulated by IL-3, IL-1, IL-6, and KL and epo. We could
thus not confirm the data of Brugger et al. (7) who showed
that IFN-'y stimulates the expansion of CFC induced by the
same four cytokine combination using peripheral blood
CD34 + cells. Differences in target cell populations and pu-
rity, or in cell isolation procedure and culture could account
for this discrepancy. Earlier reports showed suppressive effects
PrimitiveCD342§ Cells
of IFN-3, on committed progenitor ceils (16-18). However,
in these reports, various crude conditioned media were used
to stimulate progenitor cell proliferation, the experiments were
performed with relatively unpurified bone marrow popula-
tions and single cell assayswere never performed, so that most
probably indirect effects were measured.
Other cytokines that have been identified as negative regu-
lators of hematopoiesis, i.e., TGF-B (19-21) and some members
of the chemokine-family of cytokines, among which macro-
phage inflammatory protein lot (MIP-lot) (22-24), tend to
display a selectivity for the inhibition of primitive progen-
itor ceUs,but, in contrast to IFN-3' (2-4), they also inhibit
committed early human erythroid and myeloid progenitor
cells responsive to single CSF or to combinations of two
growth factors (20-24). Among the more mature progen-
itor cells, only the G-CSF-induced proliferation of relatively
mature progenitors committed to the neutrophilic lineage
is directly inhibited by IFN-3' (4).
Quite surprisingly, besides inhibiting the growth factor-
induced proliferation of CD342+CD38 - cells, IFN-3' also
maintains their viability in the absence of other cytokines.
To the best of our knowledge, such a phenomenon has not
been described for TGF-B and MIP-lot. We have already
shown that IFN-y promotes the survival of more mature
human committed erythroid and myeloid progenitor cells (25).
IFN-3' probably inhibits apoptosis of progenitor cells. How-
ever, due to the very limited number of CD34 z+CD38-
cells that could be isolated from a bone marrow sample, we
could not confirm this mechanism by either demonstrating
a DNA-ladder or by flow cytometry.
Since IFN-3' is an inflammatory cytokine that at the same
time inhibits proliferation and cell death of very primitive
progenitor cells and stimulates proliferation of more mature
progenitors, it might, in situations of increased demand for
blood cells such as infection and inflammation, stimulate the
expansion of committed progenitor ceils and their prolifera-
tion and differentiation into mature cells (2-7), while at the
same time sparing the cells of the very primitive stem cell
compartment from recruitment and thus protecting this com-
partment from exhaustion. IFN-'y could therefore be useful
in the setting of chemotherapy for cancer as a stem cell pro-
tecting agent against cell cycle-specific drugs. Our data fur-
thermore support the hypothesis that IFN-y is a candidate
inhibitor of hematopoiesis in the setting of at least some cases
of severe aplastic anemia (26). In view of the recent evidence
that IFN-'y stimulates progenitor cell proliferation (2-7), this
controversial hypothesis (26, 27) had become less attractive.
The data presented here however indicate that IFN-'y can in-
deed inhibit hematopoiesis through a selective and direct effect
on very primitive stem cells.
In conclusion, IFN-3' inhibits the proliferation of veryprimi-
tive CD342§ - cells and not of more mature
CD34 +CD38 § cells and is thus a selective hematopoietic
stem cell inhibitor. IFN-y, moreover, promotes the survival
of CD342 +CD38- cells.
