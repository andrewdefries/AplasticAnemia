(Received for publication, November 30, 1937)
The larvae of the mosquito, Agdes aegypti, require for their normal
growth and development certain accessory growth substances which
they obtain, in nature, from living microorganisms. All attempts to
grow the larvae in the absence of living microorganisms proved unsuc-
cessful, until it was found (1) that a medium containing heat-killed
yeast and 0.5 per cent Lilly liver extract No. 343 (a partially purified
preparation used for the treatment of pernicious anemia) would sup-
port normal growth under sterile conditions. The growth factor,
designated as factor A, which is present in liver extract, cannot be
supplied (2) by the highly purified anti-anemic preparations of Dakin
and West (3) and Jacobson and Subbarow (4), showing that factor A
and the antipernicious anemia principle are not identical. Factor A
does, however, resemble the anti-anemic substance in the following
ways. It is abundant in liver and kidney and less so in heart, while
body muscle contains very little (2, 5). It can be adsorbed by char-
coal and dialyzed through a collodion membrane (2, 6). It is heat-
stable in neutral or slightly acid solution, but is destroyed by ashing,
by boiling for 1 hour with 0.5 ~ sulfuric acid, or by exposure at room
temperature for 24 hours to 0.5 N sodium hydroxide (2, 3). It is
present in small amount in that portion of aqueous liver extract
precipitated by 70 per cent alcohol, and in large amount in the pre-
cipitate obtained when the 70 per cent alcoholic filtrate is brought to
a concentration of 95 per cent alcohol (2, 7).
These resemblances seemed to warrant further investigation.
Wakeflin's finding (8) that normal human urine contains a substance

470 MOSQUITO GROWTH FACTOR ABSENCE IN ANEMIA
effective against pernicious anemia suggested the assay for mos-
quito growth factor of urine extracts from normal persons and from
patients with aplastic anemia and with pernicious anemia before and
after adequate treatment.
Two of us prepared the urine extracts, while the other performed
the mosquito growth tests, usually in ignorance of the type of person
from whom the extract was obtained.
Methods
1. Preparation of the Urine Extracts.--All the urine passed during a 24 hour
period was collected with a few drops of toluene as a preservative and stored in a
refrigerator. It was then measured, evaporated under reduced pressure at 55°C.
to a volume of about 150 cc., and poured into a volume of 95 per cent alcohol
sufficient to give a final concentration of 70 per cent alcohol. The mixture was
allowed to stand overnight and was then filtered. The filtrate was concentrated
under reduced pressure to about 100 cc. and was poured into enough absolute
alcohol to give a concentration of 95 per cent alcohol. After vigorous shaking, a
fine flocculent precipitate settled out. This was filtered off and dissolved in
100 cc. of distilled water. The pH was adjusted to 6.0 and the material was
autoclaved ~ hour at 120°C.
2. The Mosquito Growth Test.--Significant results can be obtained only if the
larvae are reared in the absence of living microorganisms. As in previous work
on the nutrition of mosquito larvae (2), 1 to 2 day old eggs of A~desaegypti were
sterilized on the outside and placed in tubes of sterile 0.5 per cent Lilly liver
extract No. 343. 4 days later the young larvae were washed in sterile distilled
water and inoculated into the experimental tubes. These were prepared by
making suitable dilutions of the urine extract with sterile distilled water. Each
tube contained a total of 6 cc. of medium and received 0.3 cc. of washed killed
yeast suspension. Three larvae were inoculated into each tube. Each urine
extract was tried in at least four different dilutions, using at least two tubes for
each dilution. Some of the extracts were tested several different times with
concordant results. The tubes containing the larvae were held in an incubator at
28° -4- l°C. and were observed daily at first and then every other day for a period
of about 20 days, the number of larvae in each instar being noted.
RESULTS
(a) In Urine Extracts.-
It has been shown (2) that in the presence of killed yeast (0.1 cc.
per larva) and 0.5 per cent Lilly liver extract No. 343 (or other suit-
able source of growth factor A) (2) all the larvae reach the third
instar on the 3rd day, and nearly all reach the fourth instar on the

4th day and emerge as adult mosquitoes on the 9th day. With the
same amount of killed yeast in distilled water (or in various other
media not containing factor A) the larvae never get beyond the second
instar, and they eventually die in this stage.
Preliminary trials with normal urine extract showed that while
many of the larvae reached the third instar, only a few reached
the fourth and none emerged as adults. Thus normal urine extract
either does not contain enough factor A to bring about normal growth,
or else contains only some of the substances which are responsible for
the factor A activity. Concentrations of urine extract higher than
40 per cent by volume were generally toxic, all the larvae being dead
1 day after inoculation. In the middle range of concentrations,
depending on the urine extract used, the larvae either survived for a
long time in the second instar or reached the third instar and then
survived at this stage.
Accordingly, the percentage of larvae reaching the third instar
within 20 days was taken as the chief criterion of growth. The other
criteria were the average time to reach the third instar and the per-
centage reaching the fourth instar (very small even in the most
favorable cases). On the basis of these criteria the urine extracts
were rated with respect to their growth factor content as -, -b, -b +,

etc. Table I gives some of the actual data and illustrates the method
of rating.
The results with the various urine extracts tested and rated in
this manner are given in Table II.

lated as a flavine-purine complex (1.2 per cent flavine-phosphate).
The other was present in a fraction (designated as calcium-filtrate
fraction) derived from the material obtained from liver extract by
adsorption on charcoal and elution with alcohol (6). In the presence
of killed yeast, neither of these two fractions alone supported normal
growth of the larvae. But both together, in a concentration such
that 100 cc. of solution contained that amount of each which was
derived from 50 grn. of liver, gave entirely normal growth and meta-
morphosis. The method employed for the quantitative assay of
factor A has been previously described (2). A growth index is ob-
1
tained as a number, N X f, which is determined by the percentage
of larvae reaching the fourth instar in 10 days and the average time
required to reach the fourth instar. When growth proceeds at an
1
optimum rate, the value of N X ~ is 100 X 1~ or 25. Five of the
urine extracts were tested in the presence, first, of an optimum con-
centration of flavine-purine complex and second, of an optimum con-
centration of calcium-filtrate factor. Growth in all the urine extracts
plus flavine-purine complex was the same as in the urine extract
1
alone, so that N X ~ equalled zero. But normal urine extract plus
calcium-filtrate fraction gave growth almost as good as in flavine-
purine complex plus calcium-filtrate fraction. These results are
shown in Table III. It is worth noting that in this test, as well as
in the test shown in Table II, extracts C:2, rated as + + +, and D:2,
rated as + + + + +, gave growth as good as did the normal extract
W: 2, rated as +++, while the growth obtained with D: 1 and A: 2,
both rated as +, was markedly less.
DISCUSSION
The data of Table II demonstrate that normal urine, as well as
urine from persons with aplastic anemia or leukemia, contains a sub-
stance which, under the described conditions, will enable many
Agdes aegypti larvae to reach the third instal and a few to reach the
fourth instar. In the urine of nine pernicious anemia patients this
substance was absent or present in much smaller amount. Following
a full remission of symptoms produced by liver extract therapy the
478 MOSQUITO GROWTH FACTOR ABSENCE IN ANEMIA
urine from all of these patients showed an increased amount of the
mosquito growth factor. In the urine of seven of the nine patients
the amount of this substance was greatly increased, reaching or
slightly exceeding that present in normal urine. Interestingly
enough, the urines from a patient with cancer of the intestine and
from one with ulcerative colitis also showed a low content of growth
factor.
The data of Table III give some indication as to the nature of this
growth substance. Normal urine extract, or extract from the urine
of adequately treated pernicious anemia patients, can replace the
flavine-purine complex which is necessary for the growth of the mos-
quito larvae. Extract from pernicious anemia patients who show
symptoms cannot replace the flavine-purine complex, giving growth
but little better than that obtained with the calcium-filtrate fraction
alone. Neither normal nor pernicious anemia urine extracts can
replace the calcium-filtrate fraction. Hence we can tentatively con-
clude that the flavine-purine complex, or some material endowed with
its potentialities for mosquito development, is excreted in much
smaller amount by pernicious anemia patients showing symptoms
than by normal individuals, persons with aplastic anemia, or ade-
quately treated pernicious anemia patients. Normal urine extract,
since it does enable a few larvae to reach the fourth instar, must also
contain very small amounts of substances having effects like those of
the calcium-filtrate fraction. The data thus far obtained give no
information concerning the presence or absence of these substances in
pernicious anemia urine extracts.
Several workers haveshown that appreciable amounts of free
flavine are excreted in normal human urine (9-13). No work has
yet been reported on the flavine excretion of pernicious anemia pa-
tients. There is sufficient evidence that riboflavine is neither the
anti-anemic factor (14), the "extrinsic factor" (15) or the pellagra
preventive factor (16, 17). Nevertheless, it is still possible that there
is, in pernicious anemia, an upset in the flavine metabolism. In this
connection, the work of Laszt and Verz~r (18) on chronic iodoacetate
poisoning of rats is of especial interest. These investigators found
that rats fed on a complete diet containing suitable amounts of
iodoacetate failed to grow, and developed steatorrhea, osteoporosis,
W. TRAGER, D. K. MILLER, AND C. P. RKOADS 479
skin symptoms, a decided anemia, and great hypertrophy of the
suprarenals. All the effects could be completely counteracted if the
rats were fed ravine-phosphate, but not if they were fed lactoflavine,
indicating that the poisoning interfered with the phosphorylation of
lactoflavine, a reaction necessary in the formation of yellow en-
zyme (19).
Miller and Rhoads (20) have shown that the livers of swine fed a
modified Goldberger diet are deficient in antipernicious anemia sub-
stance. They have also found (21) that guinea pigs kept on this diet
lose weight rapidly and die in 2 to 3 weeks unless the diet is supple-
mented with adequate amounts of liver extract or vegex, when the
animals remain in normal health. An extract from the liver of a
swine on this diet, and three extracts from the livers of groups of
guinea pigs on this diet, were found to contain very much less mos-
quito growth factor A than normal swine and guinea pig liver ex-
tracts respectively. Unfortunately, these deficient extracts were not
tested in such a manner as to determine whether they were lacking in
flavine-purine complex or in calcium-filtrate fraction or in both
components of factor A.
SUMMARY
Extracts prepared from the urine of normal persons or patients with
aplastic anemia or leukemia contain a substance, possibly ravine
or a fiavine compound, which under suitable conditions of test en-
hances the growth of larvae of the mosquito, A~'des aegypti. This
substance is lacking, or is present in much smaller amount, in extracts
from the urine of pernicious anemia patients showing symptoms of
the disease. Extracts from the urine of the same patients after
adequate treatment contain as much of the substance as normal urine
extracts.
