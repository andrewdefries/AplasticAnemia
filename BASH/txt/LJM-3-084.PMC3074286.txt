Hypolipidemia: A Word of Caution
Elmehdawi RR
Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Garyounis University, Libya
Introduction
Hypolipidemia is a decrease in plasma lipoprotein caused
by primary (genetic) or secondary (acquired) factors. It is
usually asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally on routine
lipid screening. The first report of hypocholesterolemia in
the medical literature was in 1911 by Chauffard and
coworkers, in patients with active tuberculosis [1]. Since
then (about 95 years), only few dozens of studies were
published in this regard. Unlike hyperlipidemia physicians
are usually unaware of hypolipidemia, its causes and
consequences. As the interest in aggressive management
of hyperlipidemia increases, particularly with the available,
relatively strong hypolipidemic drugs and the newer and
probably stronger agents, the following question should be
answered; how low can we go in serum levels. For the time
being, it is difficult to give a certain limit for the safest and
lowest level of serum cholesterol, but knowing the
complications of hypolipidemia will raise awareness. What
might appear as a simple mildly reduced serum lipid can be
an indication of an underlying, serious problem. A
systematic search of Pubmed for all the studies in the
English language as well as the abstracts of publications in
other languages related to hypolipidemia was undertaken.
The following words were used in the search:
hypolipidemia, hypocholesterolemia,
hypobetalipoproteinemia, and statins. Search results were
reviewed.
Definition
The terms hypolipidemia, hypocholesterolemia and
hypobetalipoproteinemia are used interchangeably in the
literature, and refer to reduced plasma cholesterol. Most
authors use the total serum cholesterol (TC) to define this
condition. Yet, there is no consensus about the level below
which a clinically significant hypocholesterolemia will ensue,
and each author used a different cut-off value. Even so,
most of the authors use a cut-off value between 120 mg/dl
(3.1 mmol/l) and 150m/dl (3.88mmol/l) [2,3,4,5]. However
some authors use higher levels up to 190mg/dl (4.9mmol/l)
[6,7] while others use lower values such as 100mg/dl (2.59
mmol/l) [8,9,10].
Epidemiology
Hypolipidemia is generally uncommon but secondary
causes are relatively common compared to the rare primary
hypolipidemic disorders. The frequency of hypolipidemia
depends on which plasma cholesterol level is used to define
the condition. Among the 1,479 men selected from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-I, the
prevalence of hypocholesterolemia (<130mg/dl) was 1.8%
in whites and 3.6% in blacks [3]. In another survey
involving 772 firefighters 3.6% of blacks and 2.9% of
whites were hypocholesterolemic [3]; both surveys
demonstrate racial differences in the prevalence of
hypocholesterolemia as it is more likely to be seen in
blacks. In hospitalized patients the prevalence of
hypocholesterolemia ranges from 0.5 to 6.2% [5,6,9,11].
It is more often seen in males and is linked to increased
morbidity, longer hospitalization (hence greater cost),
increased re-hospitalizations rate, and a greater number
of associated diseases [6]. It is more commonly seen in
the critically ill and post-operative patients, those with
septicemia, malignancies, and inflammatory bowel
disease [11] and is significantly associated with increased
mortality.
Etiology and classification
Primary hypolipidemia
There are 3 rare primary disorders of hypolipidemia in
which genetic mutations cause an underproduction or
increased clearance of Low Density Lipoproteins
(LDL) and result in lipid levels low enough to cause
significant consequences. These conditions are:
abetalipoproteinemia, hypobetalipoproteinemia and
chylomicron.
Table-I: Causes of hypolipidemia
Secondary hypolipidemia
Multiple mechanisms have been described in different
diseases and clinical conditions that are found to be
associated with hypocholesterolemia (Table II).

Anemia
Hypocholesterolemia has been described in various types
of chronic anemia [12-17]. Few studies have suggested
that such patients have a lower incidence of atherosclerosis
associated events [12]. Types of anemia that have been
reported to be associated with hypocholesterolemia
include: congenital dyserythropoietic anemia [12],
congenital spherocytosis [12,13], sickle cell anemia [14],
beta-thalassemia [12,15], aplastic anemia [16] and
sideroblastic anemia [17]. The exact etiology of
hypocholesterolemia in anemic patients is not known and
the data are not sufficient, however several studies
postulated different mechanisms [12,16-19], and some
authors even suggest that hypocholesterolemia might be
the cause rather than the consequence of anemia which is
explained by the fact that cholesterol deficiency leads to
rigidity of the erythrocytes [20] making them more prone
to destruction. Hypocholesterolemia tends to occur in
patients with chronic anemia and increased erythropoietic
activity, and it has been suggested that this is due to
increased cholesterol requirements by the proliferating
erythroid cells [12]. Some researchers have demonstrated
hypocholesterolemia in patients with aplastic anemia and
correlated this with the elevated serum level of
macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), which is
known to have cholesterol-lowering activity, and they found
that pretreatment total serum cholesterol and triglyceride
levels nicely correlate with the counts of hemopoietic cells
in the bone marrow. They concluded that low serum lipids
suggest severe bone marrow failure in these patients and
can help to predict the therapeutic response of each case
of aplastic anemia [16]. Other researchers demonstrated a
significant increase in serum cholesterol following
splenectomy in patients with hypersplenism and
preoperative hypocholesterolemia. They suggest a possible
role of the spleen in lipid metabolism in these patients [19].
Bjerve et al reported a case of sideroblastic anemia and
hypocholesterolemia due to autoantibodies against LDL
causing an increased LDL catabolism [17]. Another animal
study suggested that hypocholesterolemia in anemic mice is
related to a decreased in vivo hepatic cholesterol synthesis
[18].
Hyperthyroidism
Thyroid disorders are known to affect lipid metabolism
hence thyroid dysfunction may result in changes in the
composition and transport of lipoproteins [21]. Both overt
and subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with reduced
serum levels of TC, LDL and high density lipoprotein (HDL)
[21,22]. Hyperthyroidism can also be the underlying cause
of unexplained improvement of hyperlipidemia [21]. These
hypolipidemic changes in hyperthyroidism are explained by
various effects of thyroid hormones on the lipoprotein
metabolism. Despite the increased hepatic de novo
cholesterol synthesis in hyperthyroid states due to
augmentation of HMG-CoA reductase activity, levels of total
and LDL cholesterol, are likely to diminish in patients with
hyperthyroidism due to enhanced LDL receptor-mediated
catabolism of LDL particles [21,22] and increased bile
excretion of cholesterol [21]. Moreover, the triiodothyronine
(T3) enhances the gene expression of the LDL receptor and
hence the receptor activity [21]. Thyroid hormones also
stimulate the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which
catabolizes the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins [21]. The end
result of all previous changes, is reduction in serum level of
TC, LDL and HDL. However triglyceride levels remain
unchanged [21], while the effect on lipoprotein (a) is still
controversial, because both decrease or no changes have
been reported [21].
Table-II: mechanisms of secondary hypocholesterolemia
Critical illness
Total cholesterol levels drop at the onset of acute
illness and return to normal during recovery [23,24].
Multiple mechanisms influence hypocholesterolemia in
critically ill patients and these include: downregulation of
hepatic synthesis [25], probably due to decreased
production of cholesterol precursors particularly
lanosterol and lathosterol [26], loss of apoproteins in
burns [27], and increased cholesterol catabolism [25,28].
Low cholesterol concentrations associated with high
levels of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10
[28], Hypocholesterolemia have been reported in
patients with acute severe pyelonephritis [29], major
trauma [24,26], those with multiple organ dysfunction
syndrome [25], burns [27], sepsis [30], and in patients
undergoing surgical interventions [31] . More
importantly, hypocholesterolemia is not only a marker for
the disease severity but it may also predispose critically ill
patients to sepsis and adrenal failure, and may carry a
significantly increased risk of mortality. [23,28,30,32]. In
meningococcal septicemia, Vermont et al demonstrated
that total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL levels on admission
correlate inversely with disease severity and cortisol level
[30]. The severity of hypocholesterolemia in sepsis is
directly related to the severity of acute phase response
[33]. In patients with major trauma Dunham et al
demonstrated that hypocholesterolemia improves with
recovery from acute illness but continues with
development of organ failure or occurrence of infection
[24].
In chronic illness:
- chronic exposure to IL-6 , IL-10 and TNF
- undernutrition due to anorexia
In critically ill patients:
- downregulation of hepatic synthesis, due to decreased
production of cholesterol precursors.
- dilutional effects of fluid resuscitation
- loss of apoproteins in burns
- increased cholesterol catabolism
In cancer patients:
- elevated LDL receptor activity in malignant cells
- undernutrition due to anorexia
- effect of TNF
In anemia:
- increased cholesterol requirements by the proliferating
erythoid cells
- elevated serum level of macrophage colony stimulating factor
(M-CSF)
- hypersplenism
- autoantibodies against LDL causing an increased LDL
catabolism
In thyrotoxicosis:
- enhanced LDL receptor-mediated catabolism of LDL particles
- increased bile excretion of cholesterol
- increased lipoprotein lipase, which catabolizes the
triglyceride-rich lipoproteins
- increased LDL-receptor activity

Malignancy
Several studies suggest an inverse relationship between
serum cholesterol level and cancer mortality in patients
with hematological and solid organ malignancies [34-39].
Elevated LDL receptor activity in malignant cells may be a
contributing factor to hypocholesterolemia in some cancer
patients [38]. The evidence relating hypocholesterolemia to
increased risk of cancer is controversial. In a large
prospective study of Japanese-American men followed for
> 20 years, hypocholesterolemia was associated with
increased risk of colonic cancer development; this
relationship becomes stronger as the site of cancer shifts
from the left to the right colon. The authors suggest that
the preclinical effects of occult colonic cancer is responsible
for this inverse relationship, but these effects do not
explain why the association with hypolipidemia was
stronger in patients who were later diagnosed with right-
sided colon cancer [39]. Swanson et al also thought that
hypocholesterolemia might be a predisposing factor for
endometrial cancer [37]. In a large Japanese study of 9216
persons, hypocholesterolemia was significantly associated
with an increased risk of liver cancer [40]. Moreover,
several animal experiments have found that statins are
carcinogenic at blood concentrations similar to those
achieved by doses commonly used to treat hyperlipidemia,
the carcinogenicity may be due to the effects of statins on
cholesterol [41]. Furthermore, some human studies also
connected the use of lipid lowering drugs to cancer
development. The cholesterol and recurrent events trial
(CARE), showed a significant increase in breast cancer,
particularly recurrences [42], while the trial of Pravastatin
in elderly individuals at risk of vascular disease (PROSPER),
concluded that the benefit from fewer cardiovascular
deaths was counterbalanced by the significant increase in
cancer mortality [43]. Although several recent studies give
reassuring evidences regarding the safety of statins with
respect to carcinogenicity up to 10 years [44] but this
period remains relatively short compared with the medically
accepted latency period for cancer of 20 years [45]. In
conclusion, evidence regarding the carcinogenicity of
hypocholesterolemia from clinical studies in humans is
inconclusive because of conflicting results and
unsatisfactory duration of follow-up. The available evidence
does not significantly support a direct cause-effect
relationship between hypocholesterolemia and cancer [46],
rather, the data suggest that low cholesterol levels may
serve as a "marker," or prognostic indicator of the disease
[47].
Malabsorption
Since dietary fats constitute the exogenous source of
body lipids, undernutrition or fat malabsorption can lead to
hypolipidemia. Brar et al demonstrated that celiac disease is
associated with hypocholesterolemia and a gluten-free diet
will result in rising of total cholesterol and HDL [48]. In
patients with chronic pancreatitis, cholesterol absorption is
markedly reduced primarily due to reduced intestinal
lipolysis [49]. Bile acid malabsorption was also named as an
additional factor in the development of hypocholesterolemia
in patients with chronic pancreatitis [50]. Malabsorption is a
common finding in patients with acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS) and fat malabsorption could be a
contributing factor to the disease associated
hypocholesterolemia. The pathogenesis of malabsorption in
AIDS patients is multifactorial including primary enterocyte
injury and exudative enteropathy [51].
Infection
Acute and chronic bacterial, viral, and parasitic
infections all might induce hypocholesterolemia due to
the chronic effect of proinflammatory cytokines on
lipoprotein metabolism. In 1911, Chauffard et al were the
first to report hypocholesterolemia in patients with
tuberculosis. Since then, transient hypocholesterolemia
and hypertriglyceridemia were frequently observed
during the acute phase of bacterial infections [52]. In
1920, Kipp noted an association between the degree of
hypocholesterolemia and the severity of infection [1].
These changes are mediated by different cytokines as IL-
1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) which are
involved in the acute phase response during sepsis [52].
In critically ill patients, decreasing cholesterol levels
suggest the development of infection. Some authors
believe that hypocholesterolemia is a more sensitive
marker for the onset of infection than leukocytosis [24].
Moreover, hypocholesterolemia was significantly
correlated with the intensity of the acute phase
responses during sepsis (as C-reactive protein level) [52].
Since parasites need to feed on host cholesterol for a
successful infection [3], theoretically parasitic infestation
might cause low plasma cholesterol. Several authors
have shown that hypocholesterolemia has the strongest
positive predictive value (96%) of the biological
parameters for malaria diagnosis, [53]. Visceral
lieshmaniasis also has been reported to cause
hypocholesterolemia [54]. Human immune deficiency
virus (HIV) is associated with hypocholesterolemia during
the asymptomatic phase and is associated with specific
alterations in immune function, suggesting that
hypocholesterolemia may be a useful marker of disease
progression [4,55]. Hepatitis-C virus (HCV) is associated
with significantly lower cholesterol levels (TC, LDL and
HDL) when compared with those of normal subjects.
Levels of apolipoprotein B (apoB) correlate negatively
with HCV viral load and this finding is more pronounced
in patients infected with HCV genotype 3 [56,57]. In a
Japanese study, infection with genotype 1b was also
associated with hypocholesterolemia [58]. It was
postulated that hypobetalipoproteinemia associated with
HCV is mediated by HCV core protein, which down-
regulates triglyceride metabolism, leading to steatosis
[59]. Clinically,hypocholesterolemia in genotype 3 is
associated with a more severe steatosis, and higher
grades of fibrosis pointing out a more aggressive disease
[60]. It also increases the risk of hepatocellular
carcinoma [61]. From the previous studies one can
suggest that the presence of acquired ApoB deficiency in
HCV-infected patients may be used as an indication for
treatment of HCV as it is likely to be associated with a
more progressive disease.
Chronic liver disease
Because hepatocytes are the most active site of lipid
metabolism, hypolipidemia is frequently observed in
severe chronic hepatic insufficiency [8]. A low serum
cholesterol level is associated with a higher mortality rate
in patients with liver cirrhosis [8,62]. Advanced chronic
liver disease can cause a reduction in apolipoprotein A
and apolipoprotein B levels. Isolated deficiency of
apolipoprotein B indicates abetalipoproteinemia or
familial hypobetalipoproteinemia; which can result in liver
involvement in the form of elevated transaminases, fatty
liver and cirrhosis, while deficiency of both apolipoprotein
Page 86

A and apolipoprotein B is a manifestation of advanced
chronic liver disease regardless of the etiology [63].
Chronic inflammation
Changes in plasma lipid levels are a well known
phenomenon in the acute phase response to inflammation.
Chronic inflammation also can produce hypocholesterolemia
due to the chronic effect of proinflammatory cytokines on
lipoprotein metabolism. Ettinger et al demonstrated that
chronic IL-6 injection causes acquired hypocholesterolemia
in nonhuman primates [64]. Bologa et al found a significant
relationship between TNF and IL-6 and the degree of
hypolipoproteinemia in hemodialysis patients [65]. Ripollés
et al have demonstrated that serum cholesterol was
significantly lower in patients with active inflammatory
bowel disease than in the control group [66].
Hypocholesterolemia also has been reported in patients
with rheumatoid disorders [67]. Moreover, the anorexia
that accompanies the chronic inflammatory disorders may
contribute to the hypolipidemic effect of the
proinflammatory cytokines in producing hypolipidemia in
these conditions.
Consequences of hypolipidemia
1- Effects on plasma membrane
Since about 44% of the human cell membrane is
composed of lipids, they serve as a major structural
component. Cell membranes are absolutely essential for
the cell survival as well as for biological functions [68]. It is
not known how very low plasma cholesterol levels would
affect membrane composition and function but some
indirect evidence might shed some light on this issue.
Acanthocytes are dense, contracted red blood cells with
several irregularly spaced thorny projections on the surface
due to abnormal membrane fluidity. Acanthocytosis is a
known clinical feature of abetalipoproteinemia and was also
reported to be associated with hypolipidemia in celiac
disease. In the later case acanthocytes disappeared two
weeks after initiation of gluten free diet [69].
Acanthocytosis was also reported with
hypobetalipoproteinemia in advanced chronic liver disease
[63].The exact mechanism of formation of acanthocytes is
unclear, but reversal of the usual phosphatidylcholine-
sphingomyelin ratio is considered to be a possible
mechanism [70]. In a recent animal study, the
hypolipidemic agent Atorvastatin caused significantly lower
cholesterol and higher phospholipid content of red blood
cell membrane, thus decreasing the cholesterol to
phospholipid ratio. Although these structural changes were
not associated with any obvious adverse rheological
alterations, but they show that hypolipidemia may be
associated with cell membrane lipid changes [71].
2- Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)
Intracranial hemorrhage accounts for approximately 10%
of all strokes, and carries a significantly high morbidity and
mortality as the 30-day fatality rate reaches up to 50%
[72]. Several studies have demonstrated that low
cholesterol is a risk factor for ICH [73-75]. Others have
reported that hypercholesterolemia is protective against
ICH [76-78]. Iribarren et al [74] described the association
between low serum cholesterol level and cerebral
hemorrhage in elderly men. In another study of young
patients hypocholesterolemia (</=160mg/dl) was found
in 35% of the patients with ICH compared to only 13%
having hypertension [7].
Hypocholesterolemia was more common in ICH
patients aged < 20 years and in those with cryptogenic
ICH [7]. Other authors have mentioned
hypocholesterolemia <160mg/dl (4.14 mmol/l) as a
contributing risk factor for Hypolipidemia intracerebral
hemorrhage in previously healthy people [75].The causal
relationship is unclear; however, some investigators
have proposed that the interaction of high diastolic blood
pressure and low cholesterol levels weakens the
endothelium of the intracerebral arteries [75], while
another study reported platelet hypoactivity is associated
with hypocholesterolemia [79], therefore affected
patients may be more prone to bleeding.
3- Adrenal failure
Cholesterol molecules are the precursors for adrenal
steroid hormones. The adrenal gland requires a
continuous supplement of cholesterol for the biosynthesis
of adrenal corticosteroids, which can be supplied by LDL
receptor-mediated uptake or through local synthesis [80].
Thus, at least theoretically; hypocholesterolemia will be
associated with hypocortisolemia, and during stress
cortisol production may not be high enough to protect
against the cell damage. Hence critically ill patients will
be predisposed to adrenal failure [23,30,81]. Although
few human and animal studies support this hypothesis
[30,81], several authors have shown that in reality this
does not happen [80, 82,83]. Animal studies of the
hypolipidemic drug Nafenopin have shown that despite
significant lowering of serum cholesterol levels, this failed
to alter blood corticosterone [82] and aldosterone [83]
concentrations. This is probably because of the increased
endogenous cholesterol synthesis as a result of
compensatory smooth endoplasmic reticulum
hypertrophy [82,83]. Furthermore, one study of adult
patients receiving 80 mg of the potent HMG CoA
reductase inhibitor Simvastatin for two months showed
that despite a 36%, reduction in total cholesterol level,
there was no adverse effect on ACTH-stimulated adrenal
corticosteroid production [80]. In summary; the available
evidence is insufficient to support or refute the
hypothesis that hypocholesterolemia can lead to adrenal
failure.
4- Sepsis
Hypocholesterolemia in healthy men is reported to be
associated with significantly fewer circulating
lymphocytes, total T cells, and CD8+ cells [84], thus the
host immunity will be altered and the patient may be
prone to infection. Harris et al reported that lipoproteins
bind to and neutralize bacterial endotoxin
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [85]. LPS binds to LPS binding
protein [86], activating the cell surface CD14 receptor
[87] which stimulates the release of several
proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF, IL-1, and IL-6
[88]. If LPS binds to lipoproteins, then cytokine release is
decreased [89]. It is assumed that hypolipidemia impairs
the LPS neutralization, hence predisposing to more
severe inflammation. Recently Kitchens et al [90]
demonstrated that despite hypocholesterolemia,
circulating lipoproteins maintain their ability to bind and
neutralize LPS. However in spite of this recent
contradiction this issue remains unsolved as evidence
remains inconclusive. Several authors report that
hypocholesterolemia may be a predisposing factor to
sepsis in the critically ill patient [23,30]. A significant
relationship has been observed between preoperative
Page 87
www.ljm.org.lyReview Article
Libyan J Med, AOP: 071221
hypocholesterolemia and incidence of postoperative septic
complications. Leardi et al reported that the highest
incidence of postoperative septic complications is seen in
patients with cholesterol levels below 105 mg/dl [10].
Moreover, a very low level of cholesterol is also considered
to be a prognostic factor during infection, predicting an
unfavorable outcome in elderly patients [52].
Hypocholesterolemia is the most frequently observed
laboratory finding in fatal cases of pneumonia in the elderly
[91], in a study conducted at a nursing home;
hypocholesterolemia was the only admission feature
associated with death due to bacteremia [2]. Pacelli et al
reported hypocholesterolemia as an independent predictor
of death in patients with intra-abdominal infection [92]. In
neutropenic patients with fever, non-survivors had
significantly lower serum cholesterol levels compared to
survivors [93]. From these whole data one can conclude
that hypocholesterolemia is a risk factor for infection in
certain conditions as well as a prognostic indicator during
sepsis.
5 - Disease mortality
Studies suggest that lipoproteins play a role in the
binding and neutralization of endotoxins [85].
Epidemiologic studies have identified a relationship
between hypocholesterolemia (< 130 mg/dL) and increased
mortality from all causes [14]. Crook et al stated that, in
hospitalized patients the lower the plasma cholesterol the
higher the mortality, and they demonstrated an increase in
the mortality rate from 39% to 71% as plasma cholesterol
dropped from < 77.2mg/dl (2mmol/dl) to < 58mg/dl (1.5
mmol/l) [11]. A low baseline serum cholesterol level is
associated with higher mortality rates in patients with liver
cirrhosis. There is a significant relationship and increased
risk of mortality in patients with HIV and HCV co-infections
[62]. Hypocholesterolemia is also associated with increased
mortality in patients with tuberculosis [94]. Several
epidemiological studies suggest an inverse relationship
between serum cholesterol levels and cancer mortality [34].
Following a severe trauma, dying patients appear to have
progressive hypocholesterolemia [24]. In conclusion,
hypocholesterolemia has a statistically significant
relationship to mortality in the critically ill patient and is an
independent predictor of mortality in this group.
The role of lipid lowering drugs
Lipid lowering drugs, particularly statins, are being more
widely used to reduce the cardiovascular mortality. Recent
studies show that cardiovascular risk reduction is
proportional to the level of reduction of LDL. Therefore the
American National Cholesterol Education Program
recommends a more aggressive lipid lowering strategy for
high risk patients with cardiovascular disease. This means
that LDL should be < 70mg/dl (1.81 mmol/l). Although
cholesterol lowering to this degree is more cardioprotective
in high risk patients, other possible complications may
neutralize or even outweigh this benefit. For example;
hypocholesterolemia was associated with increased risk of
colorectal cancer [36], endometrial cancer [37], and liver
cancer [40]. Furthermore, some other studies directly link
the use of lipid lowering drugs to cancer development. The
CARE trial, showed a significant increase in breast cancer
[42], while the trial of Pravastatin in elderly individuals at
risk of vascular disease (PROSPER) concluded that the
significant increase in cancer mortality counterbalanced the
benefit of fewer cardiovascular deaths [43]. Moreover; high
cholesterol has been found to be protective against intra
cerebral hemorrhage [76-78], therefore lipid-lowering
medications may increase the risk of ICH (at least
theoretically), and several studies have demonstrated
that hypocholesterolemia is a risk factor for ICH [73-75].
Considering this evidence, one should be concerned
about the potential deleterious effects of the drug-
induced hypolipidemia. We should evaluate individual
cases carefully in light of current strategies for aggressive
hyperlipidemia treatment.
Conclusion
Hypolipidemia is a common disorder affecting about 2 -
3% of apparently healthy individuals and up to 6% of
hospitalized patients. It might be a marker for an
underlying, serious problem. Unexplained hypolipidemia
should always be investigated for a possible cause.
Several clinical conditions as well as lipid lowering drugs
may result in clinically significant hypolipidemia. The
evidence regarding the carcinogenicity of
hypocholesterolemia from clinical studies in humans is
inconclusive. The available data suggest that low
cholesterol levels may serve as a prognostic indicator in
cancer patients. Low cholesterol is a possible risk factor
for ICH. Hypocholesterolemia is also a predisposing factor
for infection in certain conditions as well as a prognostic
indicator during sepsis. There is a positive relationship
between low total serum cholesterol levels, and increased
mortality from all causes particularly in critically ill
patients. Hypolipidemia may predispose the critically ill
patient to sepsis and adrenal failure and may carry a
significantly increased risk of mortality.
Currently, as we focus on aggressive management of
hyperlipidemia we should at least keep an eye on the
possible complications of drug-induced hypolipidemia.
