(Received for publication, August 29, 1935)
Two strains of chicken sarcoma (Nos. 11 and 15) are described in
this report. Neoplasms with properties similar to that of Strain 15
have not been observed hitherto in chickens (1). Strain 11, which is
similar to the spindle cell sarcoma of Rous (2) and to tumors found
subsequently in several countries (1), will be described because it
was used in studies on the nature of the transmissible tumor strains
which produce more than one type of growth (3, 4). The following
are some introductory notes about these strains, given here for com-
parison with Strain 12 described in the preceding paper.

146 LEUKOSIS~ AND SARCOMA OF CHICKENS. III
Characteristics of Strain 15
Origin.--On Mar. 27, 1934, a Barred Rock chick (No. 4534) weighing 180 grn.,
was anesthetized with ether and injected into the exposed right sciatic nerve with
plasma of a chicken with neurolymphomatosisof Strain 6 (5). On Aug. 3, 1934,
there was weakness of the right leg and in the belief that it had paralysis 3 chickens
were injectedintravenouslyon Aug. 16, each with 0.3 cc. of its blood. The chicken
was killed on the followingday and a tumor was found in the right pelvis replacing
the greater part of the kidney. The liver contained many minute (1 to 2 ram.)
tumor nodules. There was no evidence of leukosis or neurolymphomatosis. Par-
ticles of the tumor kept overnight in the ice box were injected into 2 chickens,
both intramuscularlyand intraperitoneally (Table I).

Results of Transmission Experiments.--The 3 chickens injected with the blood
of No. 4534 remained healthy, but 1 of the 2 chickens injected intramuscularly
with tumor tissue developed a rapidly growing tumor in the injected breast muscle.
The other, killed 7l days after injection, showed no evidence of leukosis or tumor.
Subsequent intramuscular inoculations with tumor tissue, summarized in Table
I, were successful in every chicken injected, but the virus of this sarcoma was not
recovered from the blood.
These experiments show that even though the chicken from which
Strain 15 was derived had been injected with plasma of a fowl with
J. FU-RTH 147
neurolymphomatosis, the tumor material and blood do not produce
neurolymphomatosis.
Inoculations with material not containing live cells, summarized
in Table II, show that the disease is readily transmitted with Berke-
feld filtrate of tumor extract, desiccated tumor, and extract of dried
tumor.
The size of these ceils varies from approximately 9 to 25 micra in longest
diameter. Their cytoplasm is pale and contains one or two eccentrically located
nuclei. The cytoplasm of many ceils is ill defined but the nuclei are sharply out-

The control injections were made with fresh tumor tissue. A medium Mandler
filter was used in the second experiment with an air bubbling pressure of 33 cm.
Hg and a flow of water of 28 cc. per minute at 40 cm. Hg.
lined. They are very clear, appear to be almost devoid of chromatin, and con-
tain one or two nucleoli that stain dark blue or red.
The metastatic tumors are usually formed by giant cells as shown in Figs. 5
to 8, but in the primary tumors, and occasionally in tumors of internal organs,
there are many spindle-shaped cells that are indistinguishable from those of com-
mon sarcomata (Figs. 2 and 4).
The origin of the predominant cells of Sarcoma 15 has not been
determined. Silver stained preparations 1 did not show nerve fibers.

148 LEUKOSIS, AND SARCOMA OF CHICKENS. III
The readiness with which the tumor is produced by the virus in the
areolar tissue of the wing makes it unlikely that it is derived from
muscle elements; the absence of the virus from the blood as judged
by the results of the experiments shown in Table I may mean that it
is not a neoplasm of macrophages. Microscopic sections (Fig. 7) indi-
cate that the tumor cells nevertheless invade the blood and occasion-
ally show transitional forms between cells like monocytes and tumor
giant cells.
Anatomical Characteristics.--Someof the characteristics of the neoplasm pro-
duced by this strain have already been stated in the introduction to this paper
and compared with those of Strains 11 and 12. The tumors grow rapidly in
muscle tissue as well as in the subcutaneous areolar tissue of the wing. They are
gray, soft, fleshy masses split into several parts by sinuses containing bloody,
viscous material (Fig. 1). Absence of bone or cartilage differentiates these tumors
from those of Strain 12, and they are never tough like the sarcomata of Strain 11.
When the injection is made through the sternal keel, tumor tissue may infiltrate
the marrow cavity, but in most instances separate tumors are formed on either
side of the sternal keel.
Of the 39 chickens with tumors at the site of inoculation, metastases were found
in 21; but with one exception none of the inoculated chickens lived longer than 62
days. The lungs were the most frequent site of metastasis (found in 20 chickens),
and in many chickens the greater part of this organ was replaced by tumor. The
metastases in liver (found in 8 chickens) were less frequent and less extensive.
Tumors in the heart, kidney, or spleen were found in each of 3 or 4 chickens.
The diagnostic cells of this strain are illustrated in Figs. 5 to 8. Wherever
found they can readily be distinguished from the predominant cells of other
chicken tumors that are caused by filterable viruses.
Characteristics of Strain 11
The virus of Strain 11 has distinctive features that differ from those
of the three other sarcomata observed by us (3, 4), but is similar to
the spindle cell sarcoma of Rous (2, 1). All chickens inoculated with
it were kept in one room, often in one cage, together with chickens
inoculated with our different agents of leukosis and sarcoma. In the
course of the passages, however, leukosis or neoplastic alterations,
such as are produced by sarcoma Strains 12 and 13, were not observed.
Origln.--Strain 11 originated in an uninoculated Barred Rock chicken (No.
3264) received at the age of approximately 4 months (November, 1932). It was
kept in a cage with 3 chickens inoculated with Strain 2. 4 months after the bird
J. FURTH 149
was received, many firm gray tumor nodules were found in its skin, measuring
from 0.5 to 2 cm. in diameter. Similar tumor nodules were found in the subcuta-
neous tissue and liver. There was no evidence of leukosis.
Transmission Experiments.--The chicken was killed, tumor tissue cut up in
the presence of Locke's solution, and tumor particles injected into the skin, sub-
cutaneous tissue, and breast muscle of 4 chickens. Similar material was filtered

The tumor produced regressed in 4 of the 7 chickens of passage III. For
intravenous injection the tumor cell suspension was filtered through cotton.
through cotton and injected intravenously into 2 chickens. 3 of the 4 chickens
developed tumors at the site of injection(Table III), the fourth remained healthy
and was given another injection of tumor particles in the breast muscle 5 months
later. A slowly growing fibrosarcoma developed at the site of reinjection.
The results of inoculations with tumor tissue deriving from chicken
3264 are summarized in Table III. Fresh tumor tissue injected in-

tramuscularly produced tumors in 81 per cent, that injected intra-
venously in 37.5 per cent of the inoculated birds. Of the injections
made with tumor tissue, dried in the frozen state, 54 per cent were
successful (Table IV).
Anatomical Characteristics.--The tumors of Strain 11 are slow growing, tough,
confluent, nodular masses of tissue with microscopic appearances illustrated in

From 1 to 4 four samples were tested on each chicken and each sample was
tested on from 2 to 4 chickens.
Figs. 9 to 12. The chronicity of these tumors is indicated by the small number of
passages that have been required to keep this strain alive during 2 years.
Of 17 chickens injected intramuscularly, metastases were found in 6, of which
3 were killed from 55 to 172 days, and 3 died from 45 to 210 days, after injection.
The size of the primary tumors found in the muscle tissue at the time of death
varied from 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm. (53 days after injection) to 7 x 4 x 4 cm. (172 days after
injection). The primary tumors in the chickens which had no metastases were of
similar size and the birds died or were killed from 43 to 136 days after inoculation.

To determine the favorite sites of growth of Sarcoma 11, 13 chickens were
injected intravenously. These birds died after from 43 to 183 days with the
exception of one that was killed after 61 days. Thus 19 chickens were available
in the study of the localization of lesions in sites other than the injected muscle
tissue. Tumors were found in the liver (13 cases), heart (8 cases), lung and
spleen (5 cases each), voluntary muscle and kidney (4 cases each), and in only
one or two cases in the following organs: thymus, mesentery, adrenal, ovary, skin,
bone, or bone marrow.
Combined Inoculation with a Pure Leukosis and a Pure Sarcoma
Virus
The following experiments were undertaken to obtain information
on the character of the naturally occurring strains that produce both
sarcoma and erythroleukosis. Such strains have been recently de-
scribed by several workers (6, 7, 4) and the question arose whether
they are produced by one or Several viruses. In Experiments A and
B the virus of pure sarcoma (Strain 11) and the virus of pure leukosis
(Strain 1) were injected separately into the same chickens.
*ExperimentA.--3 chickens receivedan intravenous injection of 0.2 cc. of leuko-
tic blood of Strain 1 and a similar injection of 1 cc. of tumor extract of Strain 11.
One died 33 days after injection with a 7 ram. tumor at the site of intravenous
needle puncture and two 2 ram. tumor nodules in the spleen. Another died 116
days after injection showing numerous tumor nodules in the subcutaneous and
muscle tissues and liver and a pathological fracture of the right femur. These 2
chickens gave no evidence of leukosis; but the third died of erythroleukosis com-
bined with myeloid leukemia 59 days after injection, showing no evidence of
sarcoma.
Experiment B.--Splenic cell suspension of a chicken with erythroleukosis
(Strain 1) was injected intramuscularly and intravenously into each of 4 chickens.
3 days later sarcoma particles (Strain 11) were injected intramuscularly into the
same chickens. One killed 141 days and another one that died 109 days after
the first injection developed sarcoma only. The third, killed after 30 days, had
sarcoma and erythroleukosis, and the fourth, killed after 26 days had sarcoma and
aplastic anemia.
Microscopic examinations have shown that one virus did not modify
the effect of the other virus and that the histological changes pro-
duced by the complex Strain 13 (4) were not reproduced by the com-
bination of sarcoma of Strain 11 and leukosis of Strain 1. Therefore,
if Strain 13 is composed of a mixture of sarcoma and leukosis viruses
152 LEUKOSIS~ AND SARCOMA OF CHICKENS. III
the sarcoma virus is different from that of strain 11. The experi-
ments show'furthermore that in vivo, Sarcoma 11 and leukosis do not
help each other.
Inoculations were made with the blood of chicken 4966 (of Experi-
ment B) that had sarcoma and aplastic anemia with the purpose of
reisolating leukosis of Strain 1 free from sarcoma. Previous studies
have shown that the virus of erythroleukosis may give rise to chronic
anemia with no evidence of erythroblastic proliferation (8), that is,
to an alteration which is doubtless not neoplastic. The agent of
leukosis of Strain 1 circulates in the blood in very high concentration
(9) but the virus of sarcoma is often absent in the blood of tumor-
bearing chickens (see for example the experiments given in Table I).
Experiment C.--The hematocrit values of the blood of chicken 4966 were:
plasma, 94.8 per cent; erythrocytes, 5 per cent; and leukocytes, less than 0.2
per cent. The blood smear showed an occasional polychrome erythrocyte and
that most of the white cells weresmall lymphocytes. The bone marrow contained
abundant fat and showed only very slight evidence of blood-forming activity.
4 chickens were injected each with 0.5 cc. of blood of this chicken, intravenously,
with 0.3 cc. intramuscularly. 3 of the 4 chickens developed characteristic eryth-
roleukosis, but none had sarcoma.
Thus transmission with blood from a chicken that had aplastic
anemia (produced by Strain 1) and sarcoma (produced by Strain 11)
gave rise to erythroleukosis only. Experiment C shows that when a
chicken has erythroleukosis and sarcoma produced by two viruses,
the virus of erythroleukosis may be readily reisolated from the blood
which often does not contain the virus of sarcoma (3).
In the following experiment an attempt was made to reisolate the
virus of sarcoma from a chicken that had both erythroleukosis and
sarcoma.
ExperimentD.--Tissue cultures were prepared from chicken 4963 (of Experi-
ment B) that had both sarcoma and leukosis. The tumor particles were embedded
in the homologous plasma overwhich serum of the same chicken was placed. The
cultures consisted of spindle-shaped and fibroblast-like ceils and there was no
evidence that they were related to monocytes or to histiocytes.
Subcultures were made at from 4 to 6 day intervals in plasma and serum of
normal chickens. The results of inoculations with these tissue cultures were as
follows:

It has not been possible thus far to keep the virus of erythroleukosis
alive in vitro for more than a few days. Hence it may be expected
that tissue cultures of sarcoma from chickens that have also leukosis
will yield the pure virus of sarcoma. Experiment D shows that all
birds inoculated with the tissue cultures developed sarcoma and none
had leukosis, with the exception of one chicken, accidentally killed
9 days after injection, which appeared healthy. This is in striking
contrast to the findings with sarcoma of Strain 13, a pure culture of
which produces both sarcoma and erythroleukosis (10). These ex-
periments indicate that the sarcoma cells of Strain 11 do not support
the growth of the virus of leukosis of Strain 1.
Caldwell (11) distinguishes four types of interaction of two strains
of plant viruses: (a) a virus may inhibit the development of another
virus in the host tissues; (b) the second virus may multiply in the
tissue without inducing typical disease symptoms; (c) the two viruses
may multiply each inducing typical symptoms of its disease; (d) the
effect of the second virus may cause a more severe disease than
either virus alone could have caused. There are no experimental
data available concerning the interaction of tumor-producing viruses.
The experiments here described show that leukosis of Strain 1 and
sarcoma of Strain 11, when injected into the same animals, retain
their identity and can be reisolated. These experiments do not
elucidate the behavior of some complex transmissible strains (e.g.
endothelioma and erythroblastic proliferation seem to be produced
by a single virus of Strain 13 (4)), but they demonstrate that
viruses of sarcoma and leukosis retain their identity under varied ex-
perimental conditions.
SUMMARY AND COI~'C~USIONS
Two transmissible sarcomata (Nos. 15 and 11) are described.
Strain 15 originated in a chicken injected with neurolymphornatosis
154 LEUKOSIS~ AND SARCOMA OF CHICKENS. III
of Strain 5. Its virus produces sarcoma characterized by peculiar
giant cells, different from those of the other known chicken sarcomata.
It does not produce neurolymphomatosis or leukosis.
Strain 11 is morphologically similar to the spindle cell sarcoma of
Rous and of other workers. It occurred in an uninjected control
chicken and its virus produces sarcoma unassociated with leukosis.
Both Strains 11 and 15 can be readily transmitted with material
free from viable cells and their virus can be preserved by drying in
the frozen state.
The viruses of leukosis of Strain 1 and sarcoma of Strain 11 when
injected into the same bird retain their identity and can be readily
reisolated.
