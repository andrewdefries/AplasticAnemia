ABSTRACT
Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is characterized by renal phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, and aberrant vitamin D3
metabolism and is caused by fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23)–producing mesenchymal tumors, which are often difficult to locate.
We investigated the utility of selective venous sampling in tumor localization. The primary endpoint was identification of the FGF-23
concentration ratio between the venous drainage of the tumor bed and the general circulation that was diagnostic of the location of an
FGF-23-secreting tumor. Fourteen subjects underwent 15 sampling procedures after functional and anatomic imaging studies. Subjects
fit into three imaging categories: no suspicious site, multiple sites, and single site (positive controls). FGF-23 levels were measured by
ELISA. Suspicious tumors were resected for diagnosis, confirmation, and cure. In subjects with a positive venous sampling study and
subsequent cure, a minimum ratio of 1.6 was diagnostic. In 7 of 14 subjects there was suggestive imaging, a diagnostic ratio, and an
associated TIO tumor (true positive). Four of these required complicated resection procedures. In 4 of 14 subjects with no suspicious site
on imaging studies, an FGF-23 diagnostic ratio was not detected (true negative). Biopsy or resection of a single lesion in 2 of 14 subjects
with a diagnostic ratio failed to identify a TIO tumor (false positive). A diagnostic FGF-23 ratio was absent in 1 of 14 subjects whose tumor
was a single highly suspicious lesion on imaging studies (false negative). These data yield a sensitivity of 0.87 [95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.47–0.99] and a specificity of 0.71 (95% CI 0.29–0.96). Selective venous sampling for FGF-23 was particularly useful in subjects with
multiple suspicious sites or an anatomically challenging planned resection but not in the absence of a suspicious lesion on imaging
studies. ß 2011 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Introduction
Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by
defective mineralization, reduced formation of mature
bone, and the accumulation of osteoid. Tumor-induced
osteomalacia (TIO), also known as oncogenic osteomalacia, is a
rare acquired paraneoplastic disorder characterized by hypopho-
sphatemia, renal phosphate wasting, hyperphosphaturia, osteo-
malacia, and inappropriately low serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] levels.(1,2)
Clinical features include progressive
bone pain, muscle weakness, fatigue, gait disturbances, and
recurrent fractures. TIO is usually caused by phosphaturic
mesenchymal tumors (PMTs) of mixed connective tissue variant
type (MCT) that produce and secrete fibroblast growth factor
23 (FGF-23).(3,4)
FGF-23 is a 32-kDa protein identified in 2000 as
the protein mutated in autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic
rickets (ADHR)(5–7)
and recognized as an important regulator of
phosphate and vitamin D metabolism. It consists of an N-
terminal region containing the FGF homology domain and a 71-
amino-acid C-terminus. Data thus far support the model that
FGF-23 binds to Klotho and an FGF receptor in the renal tubule
and inhibits both phosphate reabsorption via action on the
sodium-phosphate cotransporters 2a (NaPi-IIa) and 2c (NaPi-IIc)
and 1a-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] to
1,25(OH)2D3. It also stimulates the 24-hydroxylase that inacti-
vates 1,25(OH)2D3 at the proximal renal tubule. The likely primary
physiologic source of circulating FGF-23 is bone cells, especially
osteocytes.(8–11)
To date, there have been a few case reports on the successful
use of selective venous catheterization and sampling for the

localization of PMTs.(12–16)
As this technique becomes more
widely used, it is important to identify criteria for a diagnostic
study and the circumstances under which the procedure is likely
to be of clinical utility.
The objectives of this study were the identification of an FGF-
23 concentration ratio between the venous drainage of the
tumor bed and the general circulation that was diagnostic of the
location of an FGF-23-secreting tumor and to assess the utility of
selective venous sampling for FGF-23 measurement in tumor
localization in subjects with either negative or inconclusive
imaging studies.
Subjects, Materials, and Methods
Study subjects
The protocol was approved by the institutional review board,
and informed consent was obtained from all subjects or their
guardians. The diagnosis of TIO was confirmed by a typical
clinical history, absence of family history suggestive of a
hereditary hypophosphatemic disorder, and biochemical con-
firmation based on hypophosphatemia, renal phosphate wast-
ing, low or inappropriately normal serum 1,25(OH2)D3 level, and
an elevated serum intact FGF-23 level. Fourteen subjects (9 males
and 5 females) between 16 and 63 years of age (median 47 years,
mean 45.5 years) underwent 15 venous sampling procedures.
One subject underwent 2 venous sampling procedures. The
subjects’ baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1.
None of these subjects in whom no definitive tumor site was
identified had a family history suggestive of a possible genetic
etiology of the hypophosphatemia. Subject 1 presented with
recurrent disease after the initial identification and resection of a
PMT in the right maxilla but with tumor present at the surgical
margins. Given the initial confirmed diagnosis of TIO, genetic
testing was not indicated. Subject 3 had a negative FGF-23
genetic analysis (for ADHR). Because he presented at age 56, a
PHEX mutation was not tested. Subject 4 did not undergo genetic
testing because he also presented at age 50. Subject 9 had a
negative FGF-23 genetic analysis and rather late presentation at
age 33. Subject 10, who presented in childhood at around age
12, had both PHEX and FGF-23 genetic analyses that were
negative. None of these subjects underwent DMP1 mutation
testing because there was no family history of consanguinity or
suggestive clinical picture.
Biochemical evaluation
Biochemical testing consisted of a serum creatinine, inorganic
phosphate level, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 1,25[OH]2D3
level, 25(OH)D level, second-void morning urine phosphate and
creatinine, and baseline serum intact FGF-23 level.
Imaging evaluation
After confirmation of the diagnosis of TIO, all patients underwent
functional imaging consisting of indium-111 octreotide (pente-
treotide) scintigraphy, [18
F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emis-
sion tomography with computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT), and
whole-body technetium-99 sestamibi scanning. Locations with
increased tracer uptake were investigated further with anatomic
imaging that included radiographs, computed tomography (CT),
and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Selective venous sampling
Subjects with negative or inconclusive imaging findings under-
went venous catheterization and sampling under fluoroscopic
guidance for FGF-23 measurements by the same experienced

interventional radiologist (RC) at the Mark O Hatfield Clinical
Center at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. The
catheter was inserted through the femoral or internal jugular
vein. Seventeen major veins and their branches were sampled.
Between twenty-five and forty-nine 1.5- to 2-mL samples per
subject (mean 31 samples) were taken. Five subjects with a
highly suspicious tumor location on imaging were included as
positive controls and underwent more focused sampling from
the veins draining the suspected tumor bed. Serum intact FGF-23
level was measured in previously unthawed samples that were
stored at À808C by ELISA (Kainos, Tokyo, Japan) per the
manufacturer’s instructions. This assay has a sensitivity of 3 pg/
mL. The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation are 3% or
less and 4% or less, respectively.
Suspicious tumors were resected for final diagnosis, con-
firmation, and cure. One subject (number 14) who had an
intracranial lesion opted not to have surgery and underwent
focused irradiation.
Primary endpoint
The primary endpoint was identification of an FGF-23 concen-
tration ratio between the tumor bed venous drainage and the
circulation that was diagnostic of an FGF-23-secreting tumor. The
diagnostic ratio was determined by evaluating only studies in
patients who were surgically cured and was derived by dividing
the maximum FGF-23 value by the mean of the values that
represented the general circulation.
Statistical analysis
The assumption was that when a tumor was present (positive
study), there would be one or several FGF-23 values that were
significantly higher than the others and that if a subject’s FGF-23
values followed a normal distribution, it would likely represent a
negative study. Whether or not a set of values was normally
distributed was assessed by several tests of normality [ie,
Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S), Crame´r-von Mises, and
Anderson-Darling]. However, it is possible that a set of FGF-23
values that was normally distributed still could represent a
positive study. If this were the case, the highest values would be
anatomically contiguous. For this reason, in studies in which the
data followed a normal distribution, the highest values also were
assessed for anatomic distribution, and if the highest values were
noncontiguous, it was concluded that it was a negative study. In
all studies with a normal distribution, this was the case.
For positive studies, the maximum FGF-23 value was divided
by the mean of the values that represented the general
circulation. The FGF-23 concentration that represented the
general circulation was determined by calculating the mean of all
the remaining values after excluding the maximum FGF-23 value
and any other values that were anatomically contiguous with the
site from which the maximum value was measured and by
qualitative inspection also were elevated.
Results
Study population
During the initial screening, eight subjects were receiving
conventional treatment with phosphate and/or calcitriol sup-
plementation, and six subjects were not receiving any treatment.
All subjects were hypophosphatemic, with serum phosphate
levels ranging between 1.6 and 2.3 mg/dL (reference range 2.5 to
4.8 mg/dL), with the exception of one patient under treatment, in
whom serum phosphate was 2.6 mg/dL. All subjects had reduced
renal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus and elevated baseline
intact FGF-23 levels ranging from 64 to 1605 pg/mL (reference
range 10 to 50 pg/mL). 1,25(OH)2D3 levels ranged from
undetectable to normal (Table 1).
Clinical outcome
In 5 subjects, there was a single suspected lesion that, based on
both functional and anatomic imaging, was considered highly
likely to be the offending tumor. These subjects were studied as
positive controls (subjects 2, 5, 6, 7, and 13). In another 5 subjects,
based on functional and anatomic imaging, there were multiple
possible locations for the tumors (subjects 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14).
In 4 subjects, functional and anatomic imaging failed to reveal
any suspect lesion (subjects 1, 3, 4, and 9).
Evidence of a clinically significant FGF-23 ratio was present in 4
of the 5 positive control subjects (subjects 2, 5, 6, and 13) and in
all 5 subjects with multiple suspect lesions on imaging studies
(subjects 8, 10, 11, 12, and 14). FGF-23 levels from all 4 subjects
who did not have an identifiable suspect lesion on imaging
studies and 1 of the 5 subjects with a highly suspicious single
lesion on imaging (subject 7) followed a normal distribution and
were considered negative studies. In positive studies, the ratio, as
determined by dividing the maximum FGF-23 sample by the
mean of the negative values, ranged from 1.6 to 18.9 (Table 2).
The differences between the maximum value and the mean
(gradient) ranged from 182 to 2753 pg/mL (Table 2).
A representative true-positive study in a subject in whom the
tumor was identified in the fat pad of the heel of the foot and
later resected for cure is shown in Fig. 1. A representative study
from a subject with two potentially positive sites on imaging
studies (patella and acetabulum) in which venous sampling
helped to distinguish a true- from a false-positive imaging study
is shown in Fig. 2. The venous sampling results clearly suggested
that the acetabular lesion was the culprit, and this was confirmed
on resection and normalization of the serum phosphorus level.

VENOUS SAMPLING TO LOCATE PHOSPHATURIC TUMORS Journal of Bone and Mineral Research 1297
An example of a false-negative sampling study is shown in Fig. 3.
This subject had a clearly identified lesion on functional and
anatomic imaging and was included in the positive control
group. However, the results of the venous sampling followed a
relatively normal distribution, and the sampling results were
considered negative. Greater certainty was achieved that the
lesion identified in the T8 vertebra on imaging studies was the
offending tumor by performing CT-guided fine-needle aspiration
of the lesion and determining the FGF-23 concentration in the
aspirate and the peripheral circulation (aspirate 1140 pg/mL and
peripheral circulation 157 pg/mL). Cytology was consistent with
a PMT. Resection of the lesion resulted in cure.(17)
Subjects 1, 3, 4,
and 9, in whom no culprit lesions were found on either imaging
or venous sampling, had persistent disease and remain under
medical treatment (true negative). All other subjects (2, 5, 6, 8, 10,
11, 12, 13, and 14) had one or multiple suspicious lesions on
imaging and underwent resection of a single lesion correspond-
ing to the highest gradient site. Seven of the subjects were cured
after resection (2, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, and 14; true positive). With the
exception of an angiolipoma (subject 5), all other tumors were
PMTs/MCTs. A biopsy of the target lesion of subject 12 was
consistent with an osteoma; thus it was not resected (false
positive). Subject 10 underwent two noncurative resections
following two venous catheterizations (true negative and false
positive). The confirmed tumors were variably located in either
soft tissue (ie, heel pad, thigh, and popliteal fossa) or bone (ie,
acetabulum, greater trochanter, distal femur, fibular head, and
vertebral body; Table 3). In a subject who had conflicting imaging
data, venous sampling was able to identify the tumor. In this
patient, PET imaging was negative, and pentetreotide scan
identified a lesion near the frontal lobe. However, the CT and MRI
were felt to be most consistent with a meningioma, which also
takes up tracer on pentetreotide imaging. Sampling of the
venous drainage of the skull confirmed that the lesion near
the frontal lobe was most likely the source of the FGF-23 (Fig. 4).
The subject elected not to undergo surgery and opted for
focused external-beam irradiation; therefore, the final pathology
is not available. However, 6 months after irradiation, the serum
phosphorus level is higher on less phosphate supplementation,
and the plasma FGF-23 concentration is lower (101 pg/mL from
166 pg/mL before treatment).
There were no complications or adverse events related to the
selective venous sampling procedure.
Discussion
The definitive treatment of TIO relies on identifying and resecting
the causative tumor. However, in most cases, these are small,
slowly growing mesenchymal neoplasms that are often difficult
to detect with standard noninvasive radiologic studies, resulting
in delayed diagnosis. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of
selective venous sampling in the management of TIO. In our
series of 14 consecutive patients with a definite diagnosis of TIO,
Fig. 1. Example of a positive result on selective venous sampling. A suspicious lesion was identified by indium-111 pentetreotide scintigraphy (A) and
FDG-PET scan (B) that correlated with an ill-defined lesion in the fat pad of the heel on MRI (C). Surgical removal of the fat pad would entail an extensive
procedure that involved the translocation of a vascularized muscle flap from the arm. The results of the selective venous sampling measurements of FGF-
23, which confirmed that the lesion was the FGF-23-secreting lesion, are shown (D) The tumor is indicated by the arrows.

we found this procedure particularly useful in specific
circumstances. It helped to discriminate the culprit lesion from
other suspicious lesions seen on imaging studies and thus
potentially minimized the number of unnecessary resection
procedures and rate of complications (eg, Fig. 2). In addition, it
was shown to enhance the level of preoperative certainty prior to
proceeding to technically challenging surgical procedures (eg,
Fig. 1). In this case, the lesion identified on functional and
anatomic imaging was in the fat pad of the heel of the foot.
Reconstruction of the heel fat pad to maintain functionality
involved a 10-hour operative repair that required transfer of a
vascularized muscle flap from the arm. Findings from the
selective venous sampling procedure added additional certainty
and comfort in proceeding to this difficult operation. Another
circumstance in which selective venous sampling is of utility is in
distinguishing potentially false- from true-positive lesions. An
example of this is shown in Fig. 4. In this case, the lesion was in
the skull, which is a FDG-PET ‘‘blind spot’’ given the diffuse brain
uptake. And while the pentetreotide scan clearly identified a
lesion, the anatomic imaging study was more suggestive of a
meningioma, which also takes up pentetreotide. In this case, we
were able to access the far anterosuperior sagittal sinus and
demonstrate a step-up in the plasma FGF-23 gradient,
confirming that the pentetreotide study represented a true-
positive study.
However, for studies in which there were no lesions on
functional or anatomic imaging to guide the venous sampling
(‘‘blind studies’’), sampling did not prove to be useful. There was
one false-negative venous sampling procedure in this series
(Fig. 3). This was a lesion in the T8 vertebral body. Because the
lesion was identified on PET/CT, pentetreotide scan, MRI, and
CT, this subject was included initially in the positive control
group, with the expectation that the venous sampling would be
positive. The most likely explanation for the fact that this study
was negative is that the venous drainage from the vertebral
skeleton is diffuse and the tumor venous effluent was dispersed
over multiple veins. This area exhibits a unique anatomy, where
the valve-less paraspinal veins of Batson’s plexus exhibit
bidirectional flow and communicate with the azygous vein
system as well as the sacral and pelvic venous plexi. Studies
performed for lesions in this anatomic location should be
undertaken with consideration of this unusual venous anatomy.
The hope had been that we would be able to identify tumors
in which there were no ‘‘leads’’ on functional or anatomic
imaging. Unfortunately, this was not the case. This may be
related to the relatively long half-life of intact FGF-23
(58 Æ 34 minutes).(18)
When a tissue secretes a factor with a
relatively long half-life, the sampling must take place relatively
close to the tumor, and it is likely in the cases categorized here as
true negatives that we were not able to get the catheter tip close
enough to the tumor. That said, while we have largely
abandoned ‘‘blind studies,’’ in the case of patients with severe
disease unable to be controlled medically, including the addition
of cinacalcet to the regimen,(19)
we most likely still would
attempt a blind study as a last resort. An alternative explanation
for negative studies is that there are cases of TIO that are not due
Fig. 2. Example of a venous sampling that distinguished between multiple positive images. FDG-PET imaging identified suspicious lesions in both the
acetabulum (A) and the patella (B) that were suspicious for the FGF-23-secreting tumor. The results of the selective venous sampling measurements of FGF-
23 (C) confirmed that the lesion in the acetabulum was the FGF-23-secreting tumor. The suspicious lesions are indicated by the arrows. This was confirmed
by surgical removal and resolution of hypophosphatemia.

vertebra. However, the results of the selective venous sampling measurements of FGF-23, sorted from lowest to highest (D) or anatomically (E), failed to
identify a confirmatory FGF-23 concentration ratio. Fine-needle aspiration of the lesion and determination of FGF-23 in the aspirate confirmed that the
lesion was the FGF-23-secreting tumor. The tumor is indicated by arrows. Surgical excision of the vertebra resulted in cure.(17)

to tumoral FGF-23 secretion. These cases may be due to
nontumoral, diffuse secretion of FGF-23. In 2 subjects in whom
we have not been able to identify an offending tumor despite
multiple rounds of imaging, there is a suggestion of a diffuse
bone marrow/hematopoietic abnormality. One subject carries
the concomitant diagnosis of myelofibrosis, and the second has
received a bone marrow transplant for aplastic anemia. While
speculative, given that bone cells are the physiologic source of
FGF-23 and ultimately derive from bone marrow stromal cells in
adult life, these cases may represent instances in which bone
marrow cells derived from bone marrow stromal cells patho-
logically secrete FGF-23 in a dysregulated/unregulated fashion.
Other considerations for negative studies include inaccessi-
bility (or at least not readily accessible locations), such as the
pulmonary venous tree, which would require a transcardiac
arterial access approach. This may have been the case in a
patient with TIO owing to pulmonary metastases who had a
negative venous sampling study in another institution that
we reported recently.(20)
This study builds on previous reports of the use of more
limited venous sampling. For example, comparison of FGF-23
levels collected from superficial veins by simple venipuncture in
patients with TIO and in whom the physical examination and
imaging were highly suggestive of a culprit tumor has been
performed.(14)
The first report was of use of the procedure to
confirm that a clinically palpable and clearly imaged right
inguinal mass represented the FGF-23-secreting tumor.(12)
In
another case, venous sampling performed on a patient with
multiple prior unrevealing CT and MRI studies revealed an
approximately 70% increase in the FGF-23 concentration in the
left femoral vein compared with a peripheral circulation FGF-23
level. In this case, a pentetreotide scan performed after the
venous sampling procedure and repeat MRI restricted to the left
knee clearly identified the tumor in this location.(15)
In another
case, a patient with a negative FDG-PET but an MRI study that
revealed a tumor in the left greater trochanter underwent
selective venous sampling of both lower extremity veins. A
twofold step-up was noted in the left common iliac vein.(16)
In yet
another case, two-staged venous sampling was performed in a
patient in whom pentetreotide and PET scanning and total-body
CT and MRI failed to provide a suspect lesion. The first sampling
procedure included all major veins and first branches and was
Fig. 4. Example of a selective venous sampling that distinguished between conflicting imaging results. For a lesion that ultimately was found adjacent to
the brain, FDG-PET/CT scan (A) was negative owing to the intense physiologic uptake of FDG by the brain. The pentetreotide/CT scan was positive (B), but
the MRI findings (C) were felt to be most consistent with a meningioma, which also takes up pentetreotide. To resolve the matter, the superior sagittal sinus
was catheterized from a transjugular approach (D), and FGF-23 concentrations were determined (E). The catheter and catheter tip are identified as
indicated by white arrows. The results of the venous sampling were consistent with the fact that the lesion identified on pentetreotide scan and MRI was
the FGF-23-secreting tumor.

negative for a diagnostic rise in any specific vein. Based on a
difference in the mean values between the chest and abdominal
body compartments, a second more detailed sampling was
performed in the abdominal area focusing on smaller-vein
tributaries. This suggested a right pelvic tumor location. Initially,
the right ovary was removed but did not contain the FGF-23-
secreting tumor. Eventually, a small right anterior uterine wall
subserosal mass that in retrospect had been present on an earlier
MRI was found to be the responsible tumor.(13)
In all the reports
cited earlier, though, imaging studies were able to detect the
tumors. Some of these case reports originate from Japan, where
diagnostic pentetreotide scintigraphy is not available. As in our
series, with the exception of the subject with the frontal lobe
lesion,(13)
in all previously reported cases, tumors were identified
on functional imaging and later confirmed with anatomic
imaging. This has led us to take the following approach to the
location of tumors causing TIO: First, we perform functional
imaging (ie, PET/CT and pentetreotide/CT), followed by
confirmation with high-resolution anatomic imaging (ie, CT
and/or MRI); if discrimination is needed between multiple
suspect lesions indentified on functional imaging or if greater
certainty is needed that the identified lesion is in fact the FGF-23-
secreting tumor, selective venous sampling and/or aspiration/
biopsy with determination of the FGF-23 concentration in the
washings is performed.
In conclusion, selective venous sampling for FGF-23 is a useful
tool in the diagnosis of patients with TIO. It is especially helpful in
distinguishing which site is the FGF-23-secreting tumor when
multiple sites are identified on imaging studies. It is also useful
when a high degree of certainty is needed preoperatively that
the proposed site is the tumor. It does not appear to be useful in
the absence of a suspicious lesion on imaging studies.
