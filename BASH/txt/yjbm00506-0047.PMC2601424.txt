STUDIES IN SYPHILIS
11. METHODS OF ANALYSIS OF YALE AUTOPSY PROTOCOLS,
INCLUDING A CODE FOR THE PUNCHED CARD
STUDY OF SYPHILIS.*
BERNARD BLACK-SCHAFFER AND PAUL D. ROSAHN
The first paper' in this series described the scope of the present
investigation, the general purpose of which is to study the disease
syphilis by a combined clinical and postmortem approach. The earlier
paper was devoted to a review of the literature on the frequency of
the changes attributed to acquired syphilis in autopsies on individuals
over 20 years of age. It was found that syphilitic changes observed
at autopsy by 17 different reporters varied from a low incidence of
2.6 per cent to a high of 29.5 per cent with a combined average of
5.45 per cent among 146,761 autopsied adults. A critical analysis
of the wide discrepancies between the observations of different
investigators was made, and it was concluded that the differences
resulted largely because of the great variability in the criteria
employed in arriving at a gross or microscopic diagnosis of syphilis.
Subsequent reports in this series will be bsed primarily upon a
study of the autopsies performed at the Yale University School of
Medicine, together with supplemental information from the litera-
ture. The present communication will describe this material, discuss
the methods employed in analyzing it, and present the punched card
code finally adopted for the survey. In addition, two samples from
the non-syphilitic population will be compared with each other and
with the residue of the non-syphilitic population with respect to age,
sex, and race. It will be shown that these two groups represent a
random selection from the total non-syphilitic population in our
autopsy series, and therefore can be used as standard non-syphilitic
controls for comparison with the syphilitic group.

5,300 consecutive autopsies performed at the Yale University School
of Medicine in the period from Septeniber 22, 1917, to March 8,
1941. These necropsies were conducted by various prosectors affili-
ated with the Department of Pathology during this period. The
largest proportion of subjects were referred for necropsy by the
New Haven Hospital, which is a non-profit Association serving the
City and County of New Haven primarily, but receiving patients
also from other communities in the State and occasionally from out-
side of the State. In 1917, 4,529 patients were admitted. During
the course of the next 24 years, the capacity increased to the present
number of beds, 524, and 12,670 patients were admitted during the
fiscal year 1940-1941. Of the 524 beds, 330 are reserved for ward
patients, 88 for semipnvate patients, and 106 for private patients.
From September 1917 to July 1940 a total of 9,162 admitted
patients of both sexes and of all ages died. Of this number, 4,371,
or 48 per cent, were autopsied, and 69 per cent of these autopsies
were upon individuals aged 20 years or more.
The City of New Haven, in which most of the patients entering
the New Haven Hospital reside, is a manufacturing and University
community whose inhabitants are largely Caucasian, numbering
approximately 162,000. The population has been fairly constant at
this level during the last 20 years, foreign-born whites comprising
approximately 20 per cent. In the census of 1940 there were 6,235
Negroes,-about 4 per cent of the total population.
The 5,300 consecutive autopsies noted above included 3,907
necropsies on individuals of both sexes aged 20 years and over. Of
these, 3,187 died at the New Haven Hospital and 96 at the affiliated
William Wirt Winchester Tuberculosis Hospital. An additional
438 died at State Tuberculosis Sanatoria, at other hospitals, or at
home, and 186 were Coroner's cases where death occurred before
admission to the New Haven Hospital.
Selection of syphilitic group:
The complexity of analyzing a large autopsy population by the
old hand method of sorting and tabulating is at once apparent and
other methods must therefore be employed. The punched card
system of analysis lends itself conveniently to this type of survey and
was therefore adopted. Rosahn,1 in 1938, described the application
of the Hollerith punched card system to the analysis of autopsy
576
STUDIES IN SYPHILIS. II. METHODS OF ANALYSIS
protocols, and the first 4,000 autopsies in this series represent the
same cases coded by him in 1938. The additional 1,300 cases which
brought the total to 5,300 were coded and punched according to the
manner described by Rosahn in his original communication. These
5,300 cards were sorted according to age, and 1,393 autopsies on
patients under 20 years of age were eliminated. As indicated in the
first report of this series, age 20 has been taken arbitrarily as the
lower age limitt of acquired syphilis. It is recognized that this pro-
cedure may result in the inclusion of a small number of syphilitic
individuals whose infection is of congenital origin, but these are
counterbalanced by excluding persons under 20, some of whom may
have the lesions of acquired syphilis.
The remaining 3,907 cards representing individuals aged 20 or
more were then sorted for syphilitics and for suspected syphilitics.
The criteria employed in choosing these cases were as follows: (1) a
past history of primary or secondary infection or a positive sero-
logical reaction; (2) a history of antisyphilitic therapy; (3) a posi-
tive serological reaction during the last admission or significant
findings in the spinal fluid; (4) a clinical diagnosis of syphilis; (5)
a positive serological reaction at post mortem; (6) an anatomic diag-
nosis consistent with syphilis. The clinical charts for all cases meet-
ing any one of the above criteria were obtained wherever possible,
and critically evaluated. In addition, the clinical records of all
patients with a known family history of syphilis were also studied.
A total of 380 cases diagnosed as syphilitic on dinical or laboratory
or postmortem evidence remained, and this group hereinafter will be
referred to as the "experimental" or "syphilitic" group. It should
be noted at this point that 380 out of 3,907 adults in our series or
9.7 per cent, presented a clinical history consistent with a diagnosis
of syphilis, or findings at autopsy consistent with such a diagnosis,
or both. This represents the aggregate incidence of syphilis in our
adult autopsy population and will receive further comment in a
subsequent report.
Selection of control group:
In order to facilitate comparisons between the experimental group
and non-syphilitics, two control groups of non-syphilitics were estab-
lished, each of which contained the same number of individuals as
the experimental group. The purpose of selecting two control
577
YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
groups was to test each against the other as regards race, sex, and
age distribution in order to verify the method devised for random
sampling. This method consisted in arranging each of the 380 cards
comprising the experimental group in sequential order by autopsy
number and similarly arranging each of the remaining 3,527 cards
representing the total non-syphilitic population. The first group of
controls hereinafter designated as "Control Group A" was selected
by taking the first card in the non-syphilitic series following each
card for a syphilitic, and the second control group, hereinafter desig-
nated "Control Group B," was similarly derived by segregating
from the non-syphilitic population the fifth card following that for
each syphilitic. In this way two control groups were established
having the same temporal distribution in our autopsy series as the
syphilitic group.
Comparison of control groups with total non-syphilitic population:
To establish the reliability of Control Groups A and B as random
samples from the total non-syphilitic population, they were dassified
as to sex, race (white and colored), and age.
Sex: There were 226 males (59.542.52 per cent) among the
380 individuals in Control Group A; 238 males (62.642.48 per
cent) among the 380 in Control Group B; and 2,232 males (63.34
0.81 per cent) among the 3,527 individuals comprising the entire
non-syphilitic population. No significant differences exist among
these values and it can be concluded that as regards sex the two
control groups represent a random selection from the non-syphilitic
autopsy population.
Race: Control Group A had 363 white individuals or 95.534L 1.06
per cent of the total in the group; Control Group B had 358 white
persons or 94.21 i 1.20 per cent of the total; and the total non-
syphilitic population of 3,527 had 3,314 whites or 93.9640.39 per
cent. The remaining individuals were Negroes, with one exception,
an Oriental. The differences among these values are statistically
non-significant, so that the three groups are homogeneous as regards
color.
Age: The age distribution by decennia of white and colored
males and females comprising Control Groups A and B and the
residue of the non-syphilitic population is shown in Tables 1 and 2.
No significant differences were encountered by applying the Chi-

Chi-square=2.7l, n=4, P-0.611, not significant.) So far as age
is concerned the control groups represent a random selection from
the total non-syphilitic population.
The above analysis indicates that with regard to sex, race, and
age the two control groups can be used as representative of the total
non-syphilitic population in making comparisons with the experi-
mental group. This method of comparnson will be used wherever
necessary in forthcoming papers in this series.
Code for the study of syphilis:
Following the selection of the syphilitic and control groups, a
new code was drawn up with the object of extracting as much perti-
nent information as possible concerning syphilis and related states.
Wherever they were available, the clinical records of these three
groups were obtained and the required information derived from
them. Moreover, the autopsy protocols were re-examined and the
tissues were subjected to further microscopic study. The code as
finally utilized appears below, and using this code new cards were
punched for the syphilis group and for the two control groups.

Summary
From September 22, 1917, to March 8, 1941, 5,300 autopsies
were performed at the Yale University School of Medicine. Of
these 3,907 were upon individuals aged 20 or over, and of this
number, 380 or 9.7 per cent had clinical or laboratory or postmortem
evidence of syphilis. The method employed in selecting two control
groups from the non-syphilitic piopulation for future comparison with
this syphilitic group is described. It is demonstrated that these two
control groups represent random samples from the total non-
syphilitic population as regards age, sex, and race. In addition, the
punched card code employed in the current studies in syphilis is
presented.
