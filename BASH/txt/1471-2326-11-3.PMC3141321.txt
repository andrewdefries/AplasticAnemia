Abstract
Background: Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a progressive, multi-system, inherited disorder of telomere biology
with high risks of morbidity and mortality from bone marrow failure, hematologic malignancy, solid tumors and
pulmonary fibrosis. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can cure the bone marrow failure, but it does
not eliminate the risks of other complications, for which life-long surveillance is required. Pulmonary fibrosis is a
progressive and lethal complication of DC.
Case presentation: In this report, we describe a patient with DC who developed pulmonary fibrosis seven years
after HSCT for severe aplastic anemia, and was successfully treated with bilateral lung transplantation. We also
performed a systematic literature review to understand the burden of pulmonary disease in patients with DC who
did or did not receive an HSCT. Including our patient, we identified 49 DC patients with pulmonary disease (12
after HSCT and 37 without HSCT), and 509 with no reported pulmonary complications.
Conclusion: Our current case and literature review indicate that pulmonary morbidity is one of the major
contributors to poor quality of life and reduced long-term survival in DC. We suggest that lung transplantation be
considered for patients with DC who develop pulmonary fibrosis with no concurrent evidence of multi-organ
failure.
Background
Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a progressive, multi-sys-
tem, inherited disorder of telomere biology. It is classi-
cally diagnosed by the presence of the triad of nail
dystrophy, lacy reticular pigmentation, and oral leuko-
plakia. Patients with DC are at very high risk of bone
marrow failure (BMF), squamous cell head and neck or
other cancers, leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS), as well as pulmonary fibrosis, liver disease, neu-
rological, ophthalmic, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal
abnormalities [1,2].
Telomeres, which consist of TTAGGG nucleotide
repeats and a protein complex at chromosome ends, are
essential for chromosome stability. They are generally
very short in individuals with DC [3]. Approximately
60% of persons with DC have an identifiable mutation
in one of seven genes important in telomere biology.
Inheritance of DC may follow X-linked recessive (DKC1
gene), autosomal dominant (TERC, TERT, or TINF2), or
autosomal recessive patterns (NOP10, NHP2, TERT, or
TCAB1) [4-10]. BMF is the leading cause of death,
accounting for 60-70% of all fatalities [2,11,12]. Hemato-
poietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can correct
BMF and other hematologic complications (i.e., MDS or
leukemia), but it does not improve other DC-related
manifestations.
Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and lethal compli-
cation of DC, even in the absence of BMF, accounting
for more than 15% of deaths in patients with DC [11].
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is pathologi-
cally similar to DC-related pulmonary fibrosis, is a dif-
fuse parenchymal lung disease of unknown origin,
reported mainly in adults [13]. Up to 10% of IPF

patients have a germline mutation in either telomerase
(TERT) or its RNA component (TERC) despite lacking
other signs or symptoms of DC [14,15], implying that
these two conditions are part of a broad spectrum of
telomere biology disorders. IPF can be effectively treated
with lung transplantation [16]. Lung transplantation is
also an accepted therapy for children with end-stage
pulmonary disease for conditions such as cystic fibrosis,
idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, congenital heart dis-
ease, post allogeneic HSCT-related lung damage, and
interstitial lung disease [17,18]. However, to our knowl-
edge, lung transplantation for DC-related pulmonary
fibrosis has not been reported.
Here we describe the first successful bilateral lung
transplant in a DC patient who developed pulmonary
fibrosis seven years after HSCT for severe aplastic ane-
mia (SAA). We also present a systematic review of the
literature on pulmonary disease in patients with DC
who did or did not receive a HSCT.
Case Presentation
The reported patient is enrolled in National Cancer
Institute protocol 02-C-0052 (NCT00056121, http://
www.marrowfailure.cancer.gov), which is approved by
the Institutional Review Board.
Case: A 14-year-old Asian boy (NCI-204-1) presented
with anemia and thrombocytopenia at three years of
age. This rapidly progressed to SAA, and he underwent
a Human Leukocyte Antigen-identical sibling donor
HSCT at age four. The preparative regimen consisted of
cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg × 4 days) and anti-thymo-
cyte globulin (30 mg/kg × 3 days). Cyclosporine and
methotrexate were used for graft versus host disease
(GvHD) prophylaxis. He engrafted rapidly, without evi-
dence of acute GvHD, infections or other HSCT-related
complications. Review of his medical records indicated
that he had a “geographic tongue” and toenail dystrophy
noted prior to HSCT, but the diagnosis of DC was not
made at that time. During the next two to three years
after HSCT, his mucocutaneous findings evolved into
the classic DC triad of oral (tongue) leukoplakia, finger
and toe nail dystrophy, and reticular skin pigmentation.
He also developed bilateral lacrimal duct obstruction,
trichiasis and urethral stenosis. This constellation of
findings led to the clinical diagnosis of DC at age seven,
four years after he presented with BMF. He was subse-
quently found to have an heterozygous mutation in
TINF2 (c.851_852delCA resulting in Thr284SerfsX5) in
his skin fibroblasts. This mutation results in a trunca-
tion of the protein product of TINF2 in the same region
as other mutations in this gene reported to cause DC
[9]. There was no family history of DC-related illnesses,
and all family members were negative for mutations in
TINF2.
At age 11, seven years after HSCT, the patient devel-
oped a chronic persistent dry cough and exertional dys-
pnea. Spirometry revealed a forced vital capacity (FVC)
of 0.78L (31% of predicted), forced expiratory volume in
1 second (FEV1) of 0.73L (33% of predicted), and the
flow/volume loop suggested a restrictive pattern (Table
1). A short course of oral prednisone (60 mg [2 mg/kg]
for 10 days) resulted in transient improvement (FVC
51% predicted; FEV1 48% predicted). Pulmonary func-
tion testing (PFT) obtained following the steroid pulse
confirmed moderate to severe restrictive lung disease,
with total lung capacity (TLC) 56% predicted, mild air
trapping (RV/TLC 33%), and a significant reduction in
diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) at 27%
of predicted (Table 1). Chest radiograph demonstrated a
diffuse interstitial pattern which was consistent with
pulmonary fibrosis. High-resolution computerized tomo-
graphy (CT) of the lungs showed bilateral diffuse areas
of ground glass opacities and fibrosis (Figure 1). Lung
biopsy was interpreted as severe interstitial fibrosis, con-
firming the clinical diagnosis.
The patient received every other day oral steroids (0.5
mg/kg/dose) as maintenance therapy. However, after
approximately 9 months, his symptoms progressed and
his pulmonary function declined, despite escalating
immunosuppressive therapy which included high-dose
pulse steroids (30 mg/kg methylprednisolone IV for 3
days per month), alternate day low-dose prednisone (0.5
mg/kg/dose), azathioprine (50 mg daily) and N-acetyl-
cysteine (600 mg three times daily). He became wheel-
chair-bound and required 24-hour ventilatory support
with nasal Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure, at age 12.
After three months on the lung transplant waiting list a
deceased donor was identified. He underwent bilateral
lung transplantation at age 13.
On gross examination, the explanted lungs were firm
and poorly aerated, with thickening of small airway
walls. Microscopic examination was consistent with a
severe interstitial fibrosing process. Throughout most of
the lung, there were both established fibrosis and
ongoing fibroblastic proliferation, with obliteration of
alveolar spaces, extension of smooth muscle into inter-
stitium and chronic inflammation, and marked pneumo-
cyte hyperplasia of residual alveoli. In addition, there
was extensive bronchiolitis obliterans, including both
established dense collagen deposition and fibroblastic
proliferation within the airways (Figure 2). Alveolar
architecture was more intact in a minority of lobules,
with mild alveolar septal widening, pneumocyte hyper-
plasia and fibroblastic proliferation, but without the het-
erogeneous temporal and peripheral pattern
characteristic of usual interstitial fibrosis. Hyaline mem-
branes and end-stage “honey-comb” parenchyma were
not present.

The patient is now twenty-one months post-lung
transplant, and is doing well, with resolution of respira-
tory symptoms and an excellent level of activity. He has
no evidence of rejection either clinically or on trans-
bronchial biopsy. His immunosuppression consists of
tacrolimus, with goal trough levels of 8 ng/ml, and pre-
dnisone 12.5 mg daily. Because of mild neutropenia, he
does not receive mycophenolate mofetil. His white
blood cell count 18 months after lung transplant was
3000/mm3
(normal range 3300 - 8700/mm3
), with an
absolute neutrophil count of 1200/mm3
(normal range
1500 - 6090/mm3
). His most recent oxyhemoglobin
saturation was 99-100% on room air; and FVC, FEV1,
and total lung capacity were essentially normal at 81%,
78%, and 81% of predicted, respectively. His DLCO
adjusted for alveolar volume was in the normal range at
85% of predicted (Table 1).
Literature review: The mortality from pulmonary dis-
ease in patients with DC is reported to be approximately

10-20% [11]. In an effort to better understand the effect
of pulmonary disease in patients with DC, we conducted
a systematic review of the literature. We searched
PubMed through September 1, 2010, using the following
terms: “dyskeratosis congenita” combined with each of
“interstitial lung disease,” “pulmonary fibrosis,” or “lung
transplantation,” as well as “dyskeratosis” combined with
“lung.” We also identified cases from the bibliographies
of those articles, as well as from general reviews of DC.
The terms reflective of lung disease used in the clinical
reports included “interstitial pneumonitis,” “usual inter-
stitial pneumonitis,” “pulmonary fibrosis,” “restrictive
pulmonary function,” or “decreased DLCO.” To be as
comprehensive as possible, our data included reports of
patients with DC, as well as those with pulmonary fibro-
sis who belonged to families where one or more indivi-
duals had some features of DC. Data were entered into
Microsoft Excel 11.0, (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA),
and analyzed using Excel and Stata 11.1 (StataCorp, Col-
lege Station, TX, USA). Analyses included Fisher’s exact
and Student’s t test. The Kaplan-Meier product limit
estimator was used to calculate actuarial survival prob-
abilities by age and cumulative incidences in the absence
of competing risks; comparisons were made using the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
We identified 48 DC patients who met criteria for pul-
monary disease and 509 patients, reported in the same
interval, in whom no pulmonary symptoms were
described. Table 2 summarizes the reports of pulmonary
complications consistent with or suspicious for pulmon-
ary fibrosis in 37 patients with DC who did not undergo
HSCT. Cases 1 - 20 had classic DC with at least two of
the three features of DC triad of nail dystrophy, oral
leukoplakia and lacy reticular pigmentation. Cases 21 -
37 belonged to families with TERC or TERT mutations,
and had pulmonary fibrosis, with other DC-related fea-
tures in at least one family member [5,19-22]. In these
families, the association of pulmonary fibrosis with DC
in the previous generation was made only after a pro-
band in a subsequent generation was identified with
clinical features consistent with DC and/or a mutation
in a DC gene. For example, in one family (the proband
is case 9 in Table 3), the proband’s paternal grand-
mother (case 28 in Table 2) had died from fibrosing
alveolitis, and his father (case 29 in Table 2) had
received a heart/lung transplant for cryptogenic fibros-
ing alveolitis [20,23].
The reports of pulmonary disease in 12 patients with
DC (including our case) who did have a HSCT are sum-
marized in Table 3. The presenting features of pulmon-
ary disease were similar, regardless of whether the
patient had received HSCT (Tables 2 and 3). These
included persistent dry cough and progressive dyspnea.
Evaluations of the patients revealed restrictive lung
function impairment, markedly reduced DLCO, patchy
or diffuse interstitial infiltrates, and interstitial fibrosis
on chest radiographs or CT scans. These findings were
documented by lung biopsy or at autopsy in many
reported cases.
We compared the reported clinical features of patients
with DC and pulmonary disease based on whether or
not they had received an HSCT (Table 4). Pulmonary
disease was 2.2-fold more frequent in the HSCT group
than in those without HSCT (p = 0.03). Patients who
received HSCT developed pulmonary symptoms/disease
at an earlier age (median 14 years) than those without
HSCT (median 37 years, p < 0.001). In a time-depen-
dent analysis (with censoring at death from non-pul-
monary causes), the median survival free of pulmonary
disease was 34 years for those who had a HSCT, and 61
years in the untransplanted group (Figure 3, Table 4, p
< 0.001). Regardless of HSCT status, once the pulmon-
ary findings became clinically apparent, the pulmonary
disease was rapidly progressive in both patient groups.
The median survival interval following pulmonary symp-
toms was brief, 2 years in the untransplanted and 1 year
in the transplanted group (p = 0.5). Most patients died
at a median interval of 3 months after pulmonary symp-
toms, range 0 to 8 years (Table 4).
Discussion
This case report demonstrates that lung transplantation
is a viable treatment option for pulmonary fibrosis due
to DC. Our report and the literature review suggest that
patients with DC who received HSCT are at higher risk
of lung-related disease than those who did not receive
HSCT. They further illustrate that signs and symptoms
of DC develop at different rates in different individuals.
The patient described here received an HSCT for what
was thought at the time to be idiopathic SAA. However,
in retrospect, the medical records and parental report of
toenail dystrophy and geographic tongue (which may
have been leukoplakia) suggest that some signs of DC
were present but not recognized prior to HSCT. We
identified 11 similar cases in the literature: each had
received HSCT for SAA and subsequently developed
pulmonary disease. In three literature cases plus ours,
the HSCT preceded the diagnosis of DC (Table 3; cases
1, 3, 9 and 12). The clinical presentations of the muco-
cutaneous triad of DC, as well as BMF, pulmonary fibro-
sis, liver abnormalities, or other related medical
problems did not develop at the same rate or in the
same order in different individuals. There was variable
phenotype expression even between affected individuals
within the same family [1,3,22]. Thus, DC may be an
under-recognized cause of BMF and IPF.
The evaluation of patients with aplastic anemia typi-
cally involves testing for Fanconi anemia and, if that is

normal, telomere length testing to rule-out DC [1].
Patients with a severe DC phenotype generally present
early with BMF, and are likely to die early or go to
HSCT at a younger age. These individuals are also more
likely to manifest other DC-related complications, such
as pulmonary fibrosis very early in life, as is evident
from our current case and our review of published
reports. Related disorders of telomere biology have been
reported in individuals with apparently isolated IPF who
had short telomeres and mutations in TERT or TERC
[24]; these individuals could be considered to have less
severe forms of DC. Careful review of the family
histories of patients with IPF and a TERT or TERC
mutation may identify individuals with mild manifesta-
tions of DC, such as macrocytosis, mild cytopenias,
avascular necrosis, cancer, or liver disease [19,20,22,24].
Although they have a similar telomere biology disorder,
these individuals may not be as clinically severe as
patients with classic DC, and hence may come to medi-
cal attention only after they become symptomatic. This
likely explains the later age at pulmonary disease in the
non-HSCT patients (Table 4, Figure 3). However, since
these individuals do have a similar telomere biology dis-
order, they are likely to be at increased risk of DC-

related cancers, such as head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma, leukemia and MDS [2].
Our current case and literature review indicate that
pulmonary morbidity is one of the major barriers to
good quality of life and long-term survival in DC. As is
often the case, our literature review was limited by pos-
sible reporting bias of more severely affected cases, by
inconsistent nomenclature, and by the inability to per-
form a uniform clinical and pathological review of the
cases in the literature. However, even after taking these
limitations into account, pulmonary morbidity and mor-
tality remain a major concern in DC; this concern is
amplified in patients who have had a successful HSCT.
Historically, pulmonary fibrosis may have been under-
recognized in patients with DC because of high rates of
HSCT-related mortality. The lungs are highly vulnerable
to damage by the effects of radiation, chemotherapy,
GvHD, and infections related to HSCT. In patients with
DC, this pulmonary injury is likely compounded by their
underlying disorder. Disease-specific non-myeloablative
HSCT regimens in patients with DC have reduced the
immediate post-transplant pulmonary or hepatic compli-
cations, and have improved short-term survival [25,26].
As more patients with DC survive longer after HSCT,
the natural progression of complications of DC, includ-
ing the development of pulmonary fibrosis, may become
a greater clinical challenge, necessitating lung transplant
in more patients.
Virtually all lung transplant recipients require three-
drug immunosuppressive therapy lifelong because acute
and chronic rejection are common complications
[27,28]. It is intriguing to note the lack of rejection epi-
sodes in our patient despite being on only two-drug
immunosuppression. Lack of rejection was observed pre-
viously in children who received HSCT for malignancies
followed by lung transplantation; this was attributed to
an already compromised immunologic state after HSCT
in the face of standard post-lung transplantation immu-
nosuppression [18].
Conclusions
Patients with DC should be monitored with annual or
biennial pulmonary function tests including DLCO. The
presence of restrictive pattern or moderate to severe
reduction in DLCO may suggest pulmonary disease and
warrant further studies. Patients with DC who require
HSCT should have careful assessment of lung function
prior to HSCT. Whenever possible, HSCT preparative
regimens should include agents with the smallest poten-
tial for pulmonary toxicity. In those with symptomatic

HSCT, referral to a lung transplant center should be
considered early. As in our case, lung transplantation
can provide patients with DC with improved quality of
life and a better likelihood of survival.
