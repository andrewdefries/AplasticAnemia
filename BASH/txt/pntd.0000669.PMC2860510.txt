Abstract
Background: An unexpectedly high seroprevalence and pathogenic potential of human parvovirus B19 (B19V) have been
observed in certain malaria-endemic countries in parallel with local use of chloroquine (CQ) as first-line treatment for
malaria. The aims of this study were to assess the effect of CQ and other common antimalarial drugs on B19V infection in
vitro and the possible epidemiological consequences for children from Papua New Guinea (PNG).
Methodology/Principal Findings: Viral RNA, DNA and proteins were analyzed in different cell types following infection with
B19V in the presence of a range of antimalarial drugs. Relationships between B19V infection status, prior 4-aminoquinoline
use and anemia were assessed in 200 PNG children ,10 years of age participating in a case-control study of severe
infections. In CQ-treated cells, the synthesis of viral RNA, DNA and proteins was significantly higher and occurred earlier
than in control cells. CQ facilitates B19V infection by minimizing intracellular degradation of incoming particles. Only
amodiaquine amongst other antimalarial drugs had a similar effect. B19V IgM seropositivity was more frequent in 111
children with severe anemia (hemoglobin ,50 g/L) than in 89 healthy controls (15.3% vs 3.4%; P = 0.008). In children who
were either B19V IgM or PCR positive, 4-aminoquinoline use was associated with a significantly lower admission
hemoglobin concentration.
Conclusions/Significance: Our data strongly suggest that 4-aminoquinoline drugs and their metabolites exacerbate B19V-
associated anemia by promoting B19V replication. Consideration should be given for choosing a non-4-aminoquinoline
drug to partner artemisinin compounds in combination antimalarial therapy.

Introduction
Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) is a nonenveloped icosahedral
virus with a single-stranded DNA genome which has been
classified within the Erythrovirus genus of the Parvoviridae family.
The virus is readily transmitted via the respiratory route and has a
worldwide distribution. Seroprevalence increases with age and
50%–80% of adults have detectable B19-specific antibody. Since
its discovery in 1975 [1], B19V has been associated with an
expanding range of clinical disorders that reflect the patient’s
immunologic and hematologic status. In healthy individuals, B19V
typically causes a mild childhood febrile illness known as erythema
infectiosum or fifth disease. More severe manifestations of B19V
infection are arthropathies, aplastic anemia, hydrops fetalis and
fetal death [2].
Viremia occurs during the first week of infection. The virus has
a predilection for bone marrow erythroid progenitor cells. At the
height of viremia, there is an abrupt fall in the reticulocyte count
and anemia can supervene. Although this is rarely apparent in
healthy patients, it can have serious clinical consequences where
there is pre-existing anemia [2]. A case in point is malaria. B19V
co-infection has been considered a significant risk for severe
anemia in children living in malaria-endemic regions [3]. Studies
examining the inter-relationship between malaria, B19V infection
and anemia have, however, produced inconsistent results. In a
retrospective study from Papua New Guinea (PNG) [4], 60% of
children ,2 years of age and 90% of 6 year-olds were B19V
seropositive. B19V infection was significantly associated with
severe anemia even in the absence of risk factors including
malaria. Similar results were obtained in children from the
Republic of Niger [5]. However, studies from Malawi and Kenya
did not show evidence that B19V infection contributes to anemia
in children and the seroprevalence of B19V was relatively low
[6,7].
At the time the studies were performed in PNG [4] and Niger
[5], chloroquine (CQ) was used as first-line treatment for malaria
in these countries. In addition, a serosurvey performed in Eritrea
at a time when CQ was the first-line agent also revealed an
unusually high B19V seroprevalence [8]. By contrast, CQ had
been discontinued in Malawi because of resistance of local strains

of Plasmodium falciparum and its use was declining in Kenya when
the B19V seroprevalence studies were conducted [6,7]. Although
CQ has, in addition to antimalarial efficacy, broad antiviral
activity [9,10], it also enhances Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and
encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection in mice [11], and
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) expression [12]. The latter effect is
thought to play a role in the higher incidence of EBV-induced
Burkitt’s lymphoma in malaria-endemic areas where CQ is in
common use [13].
We hypothesize, therefore, that geo-epidemiological differences
in B19V seroprevalence and pathogenic potential result from CQ-
associated enhanced replication. To test this hypothesis, we
examined the effect of CQ and other commonly-used antimalarial
drugs on B19V replication in three different cultured cell lines. In
addition, we examined the relationship between B19V infection
and use of 4-aminoquinoline drugs in a sample of children from
PNG who were hospitalized with severe anemia. The results
provide evidence that CQ and AQ aggravate B19V-associated
anemia by promoting B19V replication.
Methods
Ethics statement
All patients were participants in a prospective observational and
genetic study of severe pediatric infections (http://www.malariagen.
net/home/). Written informed consent was obtained from each
parent/guardian. Ethical approval for the study was obtained
from both the PNG Institute of Medical Research Institutional
Review Board and the Medical Research Advisory Committee of
the PNG Department of Health. The study was conducted in
accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.
Cells and viruses
A B19V-infected plasma sample was obtained from our
donation center (Genotype 1; CSL Behring AG, Charlotte, NC)
and was concentrated by ultracentrifugation through 20% (w/v)
sucrose. UT7/Epo cells were cultured in RPMI, 10% FCS and 2
U/ml of recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo; Janssen-Cilag,
Midrand, South Africa). HepG2 cells were cultured in MEM
supplemented with 10% FCS. Bone marrow mononuclear cells
(BMMCs) were obtained as frozen stocks from Stemcell Technol-
ogies (Vancouver, BC, Canada) and were cultured in IMDM, 10%
FCS and 2 U/ml of Epo. All cells were incubated at 37uC and in
an atmosphere of 7.5% CO2.
Drugs
All drugs were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, Miss).
Chloroquine diphosphate (CQ), primaquine diphosphate (PQ)
and amodiaquine dihydrochloride dihydrate (AQ) were dissolved
in water, piperaquine (PPQ) in 5% lactic acid, mefloquine
hydrochloride (MQ) in DMSO, lumefantrine (LFT) in dimethyl-
formamide and artesunate (AT) and pyrimethamine (PM) in
ethanol. The final drug concentration ranges used in the B19V
infectivity assay were 5–100 mM for PQ and LFT, AQ and PM,
0.05–20 mM for MQ, 2.5–100 mM for AT, 1–100 mM for PPQ
and 0.05–100 mM for CQ. The highest concentration of the drugs
did not exceed 0.2% of total culture volume.
Infectivity assay
B19V infectivity was assessed in two different cell lines, namely
megakaryoblastic leukemia UT7/Epo cells and the human
hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line HepG2, and in primary
bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs). UT7/Epo cells are the
most susceptible cell line to B19V infection [14]. Although viral
RNA, DNA and proteins can be detected in B19V-infected UT7/
Epo cells, viral replication is restricted to a level that does not
normally allow production of virus progeny. The HepG2 cell line
was chosen because it allows virus binding and probably
internalization, but it is non-permissive for B19V infection [15].
BMMCs have been shown to support B19V infection, although
only a minor subset of these cells is permissive for B19V [16].
UT7/Epo, HepG2 and bone marrow mononuclear cells
(BMMCs) (36105
) were infected with 20,000 DNA-containing
B19V particles per cell (5,000 for BMMCs), corresponding to an
MOI of approximately 20 (5 for BMMCs) in the presence of the
pre-determined concentrations of the selected drugs. For viral
RNA and DNA analysis, cells were collected at different post-
infection times as indicated in the figure legends. Total poly (A)+
mRNA was isolated and viral NS1 mRNA quantified as previously
described [17]. Total DNA was extracted and viral DNA was
quantified using established methods [17].
Analysis of viral protein expression
UT7/Epo cells were infected as specified above in the presence
of 0 or 25 mM CQ. At increasing post-infection times (see
figure 1C), cells were lysed in protein loading buffer and total
proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-10%
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). After transfer to a
PVDF membrane, the blot was probed with a mouse antibody
against B19V structural proteins (1:2,000 dilution; US Biologicals,
Swampscott, MA), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conju-
gated secondary antibody (1:20,000 dilution). The viral structural
proteins were visualized with a chemiluminescence system (Pierce,
Rockford, IL). Additionally, viral protein expression was examined
by immunofluorescence, as previously described [17].
Analysis of B19V DNA stability during intracellular
trafficking
UT7/Epo cells (36105
) were infected with 20,000 viral particles
per cell (MOI 20) at 4uC for 2 h. The cells were washed 8 times
Author Summary
Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) is typically associated with a
childhood febrile illness known as erythema infectiosum.
The infection usually resolves without consequence in
healthy individuals. However, in patients with immuno-
logic and/or hematologic disorders, B19V can cause a
significant pathology. The virus infects and kills red cell
precursors but anemia rarely supervenes unless there is
pre-existing anemia such as in children living in malaria-
endemic regions. The link between B19V infection and
severe anemia has, however, only been confirmed in
certain malaria-endemic countries in parallel with chloro-
quine (CQ) usage. This raises the possibility that CQ may
increase the risk of severe anemia by promoting B19V
infection. To test this hypothesis, we examined the direct
effect of CQ and other commonly used antimalarial drugs
on B19V infection in cultured cell lines. Additionally, we
examined the correlation between B19V infection, hemo-
globin levels and use of CQ in children from Papua New
Guinea hospitalized with severe anemia. The results
suggest strongly that CQ and its derivatives aggravate
B19V-associated anemia by promoting B19V replication.
Hence, careful consideration should be given in choosing
the drug partnering artemisinin compounds in combina-
tion antimalarial therapy in order to minimize contribution
of B19V to severe anemia.

with PBS to remove unbound virus and incubated at 37uC in the
presence or absence of antimalarials. At increasing post-internal-
ization times from 1 to 7 h, the cells were washed 2 times with PBS
and the amount of intact viral DNA was quantified as specified
above.
Clinical study
We studied 111 children ,10 years of age with severe anemia
(hemoglobin ,50 g/L) and 89 community-based age and sex-
matched healthy control children with a hemoglobin .100 g/L.
Those with severe anemia represented a subset (15.9%) of all 697
children admitted to Modilon Hospital, Madang Province on the
north coast of PNG with any severe illness during the period of
study. Modilon Hospital is a referral hospital and the only
provincial facility able to manage severely ill children. All such
children were given treatment as recommended under PNG
national treatment guidelines including intramuscular artemether
for malaria infection. The healthy controls were recruited from the
same villages as the patients and were slide-negative for malaria.
As well as a hemoglobin concentration (HaemoCueH, Angel-
holm, Sweden) at presentation, plasma was assayed for B19V IgM
by EIA kit (Biotrin International) and, in those with severe anemia,
for viral DNA using two specific oligonucleotide primers [4]. We
did both tests because viremia starts to decline once specific IgM is
produced around day 9 after inoculation, while virus-induced
marrow suppression can last for another 2–3 weeks [4]. Thus,
although the simultaneous detection of B19V IgM and DNA is
strongly indicative of acute infection, we did not want to exclude
children with evidence of recent but resolving infection as a
contributor to severe anemia. In those who were B19V IgM or
PCR positive, plasma was assayed for chloroquine and amodia-
quine and their respective active desethyl metabolites using a
validated high performance liquid chromatography assay [18].
The assay had a limit of quantitation of 1 mg/L for each analyte.
Results
Effect of CQ on B19V replication in UT7/Epo cells
CQ increased the production of B19V NS1 gene transcription
after 24 h incubation. At CQ concentrations ranging from 10 to
75 mM, NS1 RNA increased up to 1,170% (Figure 1A). Similarly,
kinetic studies in the presence of 25 mM of CQ showed that viral
DNA synthesis was more rapid and extensive than in untreated
cells (Figure 1B). The expression of structural viral proteins in
extracts of infected UT7/Epo cells was also increased in the
presence of 25 mM CQ (Figure 1C). Viral protein expression was

detectable by 34 h in untreated cells and by 24 h in CQ-treated
cells. Immunofluorescence experiments showed, that in the
presence of CQ a larger number of cells were infected by B19V
(Fig. 1D).
Effect of CQ on B19V replication in HepG2 cells
In the absence of CQ, only a minor amount of viral DNA
synthesis was observed starting at 120 h post-infection. No viral
RNA could be detected, confirming the poor permissiveness of this
cell line for B19V infection. However, in the presence of increasing
concentrations of CQ, viral DNA synthesis increased progressively
reaching 2,290% at CQ concentrations of 60 mM (Figure 2A).
Kinetic studies showed that, in the presence of CQ (25 mM), viral
DNA was detected earlier than in untreated cells (Figure 2B). Viral
NS1 RNA was only detectable in CQ-treated cells (Figure 2C).
Effect of CQ on B19V replication in bone marrow
mononuclear cells
The presence of CQ (25 mM) accelerated B19V RNA synthesis.
However, in CQ-treated cells, viral RNA transcription ceased
abruptly and was followed by progressive degradation resembling
apoptosis (Figure 2D). Detection of phosphatidyl serine–anexin V
complexes by fluorescence microscopy confirmed that the infected
BMMCs entered the apoptotic pathway (data not shown).
Therefore, the effect of CQ in cultured BMMCs could not be
evaluated at stages later that 10 h post-infection. The apoptotic
effects were not observed in the cell lines UT7/Epo and HepG2 at
concentrations up to 60 mM (data not shown).
Effect of other antimalarial drugs on B19V viral
replication
With the exception of the CQ-analogue AQ which enhanced
B19V infection at concentrations above 5 mM, no other
antimalarial drug had a significant effect on B19V infection
(Figure 3). Mild inhibition was observed in the presence of AT,
while MQ inhibited the infection at concentrations .10 mM.
These effects were also observed when the drugs were added 4 to
7 h post-infection (data not shown), raising the possibility that
B19V infectivity was reduced by a drug-specific cytotoxicity.
CQ prevention of the intracellular degradation of
incoming B19V particles
The enhancement of B19V infection by CQ decreased
progressively with increases in the time at which CQ was added,
with no detectable effect at 8–9 h post-infection (Figure 4A). These
data indicate that CQ acts early in B19V infection. At progressive
times after internalization of B19V, the cells were washed and the
viral DNA was quantified. In untreated cells, a progressive
degradation of the incoming viral DNA was evident. However, in
the presence of CQ (25 mM) or AQ (20 mM), degradation of
incoming particles was prevented or minimized (Figure 4B).
Prevalence and sequelae of B19V infection in PNG
children
Serological screening revealed that 3 of 89 healthy control
children (3.4%) and 18 of the 111 with severe anemia (16.2%)
were IgM positive (P = 0.004 by Fisher’s exact test). A further 6
B19V IgM-negative children with severe anemia were positive by
PCR and 5 of the 18 IgM-positive children were also PCR
positive. In 22 of the 24 IgM and/or PCR positive children with
severe anemia and plasma available for assay, only 5 did not have
detectable 4-aminoquinoline or metabolite concentrations. Based
on the respective pharmacokinetic profiles [18,19], this suggests
that most of these children had been treated with either CQ or AQ
within the previous 6 weeks.
Hemoglobin concentrations by B19V IgM/PCR and 4-
aminoquinoline status are shown in Figure 5. The lowest
concentrations were in the 5 children who were both IgM and
PCR positive (i.e. had acute B19 infections). These children had a
similar mean age (53 vs 57 months), body weight (15 kg in both
groups) and spleen size (5 vs 7 cm) to those children who were
either IgM or PCR positive (P.0.37 by Mann-Whitney U test)
and the percentages with malaria were similar (40.0 vs 44.4%;
P = 0.63 by Fisher’s exact test). In patients who were IgM or PCR
positive (indicating a recent but not necessarily acute infection or
one which was acute but early in its course), 4-aminoquinoline use
was associated with a significantly lower admission hemoglobin
concentration (P = 0.037). Although the number of patients treated
with AQ was small and restricted to children who were IgM
positive but PCR negative, they had some of the highest
hemoglobin concentrations in this subgroup. This suggests that,
consistent with the in vitro data, CQ had a greater suppressive effect
on bone marrow than AQ in our patients.
Discussion
Severe anemia is a common and life-threatening complication
of malaria in children living in endemic areas [20]. B19V co-
infection has been identified as a major factor in its pathogenesis
[3], but there are significant regional differences in its seroprev-
alence and resulting clinical impact [4–8] despite the fact that
B19V infection is a common childhood illness. Because B19V-
associated severe anemia appears to parallel local use of CQ as
first-line treatment for malaria, we hypothesized that CQ
promotes B19V replication and that, as a consequence, it
contributes indirectly to severe anemia. Although a more profound
clinical study would be necessary, the present results provide
already a strong evidence for this hypothesis.
Apart from its antimalarial effects, CQ has a wide antiviral
activity. One of the most important mechanisms of action against
viruses is the alkalinization of the endosomal vesicles. In this way,
CQ is active against viruses that require a low pH step for cell entry,
such as flavivirus, retrovirus and coronavirus [9]. All parvoviruses
studied to date also depend on endosomal acidification for cell entry
because it facilitates capsid structural transitions [21,22], and in
particular the externalization of the N-terminal region of VP1 which
is required for endosomal escape and nuclear targeting [23].
Accordingly, CQ inhibits parvovirus infections. However, we have
previously shown that B19V is unique among parvoviruses in that
N-VP1 is already externalized on receptor binding [17] and thus not
dependent on a low endosomal pH for this critical conformational
change. B19V is also unique among parvoviruses for its higher
sensitivity to acid degradation [24]. Consequently, CQ-associated
alkalinization of endosomal vesicles would be expected to minimize
the acidic degradation of incoming B19V particles. Our data
confirm that the intracellular degradation of B19V is prevented or
minimized in the presence of CQ or AQ. However, other
lysosomotropic drugs such as ammonium chloride or bafilomycin
A1, which also raise the endosomal pH, had an inhibitory effect on
B19V infection in our in vitro system (data not shown). Therefore, the
mechanism underlying the stabilization of B19V by CQ or AQ is
likely to extend beyond pH-neutralizing activity to destabilization of
endosome/lysosome membranes typically observed in CQ-treated
cells. In this way, CQ would facilitate the endosomal escape of
B19V before it reaches the degradative lysosomal compartment and
increase the number of particles that can target the nuclei for
replication. This is of particular importance since nuclear targeting

has been identified as a major limiting factor in parvovirus infections
[22,25].
The plausibility of our in vitro observations as an explanation of
epidemiological data depends on the pharmacological properties
of CQ, especially tissue concentrations. The in vitro enhancement
of B19V infection by CQ was achieved at concentrations (10–
75 mM) that were well above those achieved in plasma after
therapeutic doses in children (typically ,5 mM) [18]. However,

B19V does not replicate in plasma but in tissues, primarily the
bone marrow. CQ concentrations in bone marrow are substan-
tially higher than in plasma [26] and have been measured at
approximately 100 mM in animal studies [27]. This could reflect,
in part, concentration of the drug within precursor cells such as
has been observed in circulating erythrocytes [28]. The long
terminal elimination half-life of CQ (around 10 days in children)
[18] means that conditions favorable to B19V viral replication in
bone marrow may persist for several weeks after dosing. In many
malaria-endemic regions, antimalarial therapy is given empirically
to febrile children without blood smear confirmation. Ironically
this might include fever due to B19V itself. The administration of
frequent courses of CQ may mean that a child spends long periods
of each year at risk of CQ-associated enhanced B19V viremia and
its consequences such as anemia.
AQ is a long half-life 4-aminoquinoline compound like CQ and
also promoted B19V replication in our in vitro experiments. Other
drugs tested, including primaquine (an 8-aminoquinoline) and
mefloquine (a methanol quinoline), did not influence B19V
infection in vitro, suggesting that the effect is specific to 4-
aminoquinoline compounds. Some other viral infections (SFV,

EMCV and EBV) [11,12] are enhanced by CQ but not by other
4-aminoquinoline antimalarial drugs.
We were able to obtain preliminary human data that are
consistent with our laboratory findings. In our 200 unselected
PNG children who were participants in a case-control study of
severe pediatric infections, we confirmed previous reports that
B19V seropositivity is associated with severe anemia and that the
lowest hemoglobin concentrations are in those children who had
acute infections (i.e. both IgM and PCR positive) [4]. Although
there were limited numbers, there was some evidence that prior 4-
aminoquinoline, especially CQ, use exacerbates B19V-associated
severe anemia apart from in those IgM- and PCR-positive cases
who were presumably at the stage of maximal viral replication and
consequent bone marrow suppression. Properly designed epide-
miological studies in larger, non-convenience samples are,
however, needed to confirm these findings.
Although CQ is a safe and inexpensive antimalarial drug, the
increasing emergence of resistant P. falciparum and P. vivax has seen
its use decline throughout the tropics. Our data suggest that the
prevalence of severe malarial anemia should also fall as a result.
However, when an effective B19V vaccine becomes available, this
should be considered a priority intervention where pediatric B19V
seroprevalence rates are high and other causes of anemia such as
nutritional deficiency and intestinal parasitic infection are present.
Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the current
WHO-recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated ma-
laria [29]. Our data suggest that, pending more definitive in vivo
data including appropriately designed clinical trials, a non-4-
aminoquinoline drug should be preferred to partner the
artemisinin derivative so that the contribution of B19V to severe
anemia is minimized.
