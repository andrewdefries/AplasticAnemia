Abstract
Background: The diagnosis of invasive candidiasis is difficult because there are no specific clinical
manifestations of the disease and colonization and infection are difficult to distinguish. In the last
decade, much effort has been made to develop reliable tests for rapid diagnosis of invasive
candidiasis, but none of them have found widespread clinical use.
Results: Antibodies against a recombinant N-terminal fragment of the Candida albicans germ tube-
specific antigen hyphal wall protein 1 (Hwp1) generated in Escherichia coli were detected by both
immunoblotting and ELISA tests in a group of 36 hematological or Intensive Care Unit patients with
invasive candidiasis and in a group of 45 control patients at high risk for the mycosis who did not
have clinical or microbiological data to document invasive candidiasis. Results were compared with
an immunofluorescence test to detect antibodies to C. albicans germ tubes (CAGT). The sensitivity,
specificity, positive and negative predictive values of a diagnostic test based on the detection of
antibodies against the N-terminal fragment of Hwp1 by immunoblotting were 27.8 %, 95.6 %, 83.3
% and 62.3 %, respectively. Detection of antibodies to the N-terminal fragment of Hwp1 by ELISA
increased the sensitivity (88.9 %) and the negative predictive value (90.2 %) but slightly decreased
the specificity (82.6 %) and positive predictive values (80 %). The kinetics of antibody response to
the N-terminal fragment of Hwp1 by ELISA was very similar to that observed by detecting
antibodies to CAGT.
Conclusion: An ELISA test to detect antibodies against a recombinant N-terminal fragment of the
C. albicans germ tube cell wall antigen Hwp1 allows the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis with similar
results to those obtained by detecting antibodies to CAGT but without the need of treating the
sera to adsorb the antibodies against the cell wall surface of the blastospore.

Background
Invasive Candida infections are a serious and often fatal
nosocomial disease in immunocompromised patients.
The diagnosis of invasive candidiasis is difficult because
there are no specific clinical manifestations of the disease
and colonization and infection are difficult to distinguish.
Conventional microbiological methods, which include
observation of the infecting fungus by histopathology and
culture, usually lack both sensitivity and specificity and
sometimes they require invasive procedures that can not
be accomplished because of the clinical conditions of the
patients [1]. As a result of these problems, therapy is often
initiated late in the course of infection, resulting in sub-
stantial morbidity and mortality [2].
During the last two decades, much effort has been made
to develop reliable tests for rapid diagnosis of invasive
candidiasis leading to appropriate therapy. These tech-
niques include the detection of fungal nucleic acid by PCR
[3], (1→3) β-D-glucan [4], D-arabinitol [5] and a number
of circulating antigens and antibodies [6]. However, all
techniques have limitations and, at the moment, none of
them have found widespread clinical use.
Candida albicans is a fungus that can grow in either the
yeast form or the hyphal form, and the ability to germi-
nate and form hyphae may be a factor for the virulence of
this organism in vivo [7,8]. Our group has previously
reported that the detection of antibodies specifically
directed to antigens expressed on the C. albicans germ tube
surface (CAGT) by indirect immunofluorescence has
shown a sensitivity of 79–89 % and a specificity of 91–
100% for the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis on both
competent and immunocompromised patients [6,9,10].
A number of antigens specifically expressed on the C. albi-
cans germ tube cell wall have been identified recently
including hyphal wall protein 1 (Hwp1) [11], Als3p [12],
Ece1p [13] and Hyr1p [14]. As it has been studied in other
mycoses [15], these antigens can be obtained in recom-
binant form, allowing the detection of antibodies against
them.
In this study, we report the development of both an
immunoblotting and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) for the serodiagnosis of invasive Candida
spp. infections by detecting specific antibodies against a
recombinant N-terminal fragment of Hwp1. Results were
compared with an immunofluorescence test to detect
antibodies to CAGT.
Results
Characterization of the recombinant N-Hwp1 fragment
The purified N-Hwp1 fragment obtained in this study
yielded a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 38
kDa, while the purified int-Hwp1 yielded a protein of 42
kDa (Fig. 1A). Both recombinant fragments reacted by
immunoblotting with the anti HSV·tag® monoclonal
antibody (Fig. 1B). However, the anti HSV·tag® mono-
clonal antibody revealed that the purified N-Hwp1
migrated as a doublet of 36–38 kDa. The purified
rHwp1N13KV-c~myc fragment yielded a protein of 34
kDa (Fig. 1A). A monoclonal antibody against the c-
Myc·tag revealed that the purified rHwp1N13KV-c~myc
fragment migrated also as a doublet of 34–36 kDa (Fig.
1B). Differences in molecular mass between N-Hwp1 and
rHwp1N13KV-c~myc proteins are explained by the differ-
ent size of the Hwp1 fragments and the different tags
used.

A rabbit anti-N-Hwp1 antiserum reacted with both N-ter-
minal Hwp1 fragments (Fig. 1C). The antiserum revealed
the existence of two closely located bands in both N-
Hwp1 and rHwp1N13KV-c~myc fragments with molecu-
lar masses of 36–38 kDa and 34–36 kDa, respectively (Fig.
1B). The specificity of the anti-N-Hwp1 antiserum was
confirmed by the lack of reactivity with the int-Hwp1 frag-
ment (Fig. 1C).
Detection of antibodies by immunoblotting
The reactivity of the N-Hwp1 was tested by immunoblot-
ting with 342 sera from 81 different patients. The N-termi-
nal fragment was recognized as a double band of 36–38
kDa by sera from10 patients from group 1 (27.8 %) (Fig.
1D, Table 1). In four patients, the antibody response
against N-Hwp1 was detected after the blood culture pos-
itive for Candida. Group 1 patients with antibodies against
the recombinant N-Hwp1 fragment were infected with C.
albicans and C. glabrata (Table 1). Sera from patients
infected with C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. guilliermondii, C.
parapsilosis and C. utilis did not recognize the recombinant
N-Hwp1 fragment by this technique. The majority of
group 2 patients did not react by Western Blotting (Fig.
1D). However, two patients from group 2 (4.4 %) had
antibodies that reacted with the recombinant N-Hwp1
fragment (Table 2). None of the sera recognized the int-
Hwp1 fragment.
The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive
values of a diagnostic test based on the detection of anti-
bodies against the N-Hwp1 fragment by immunoblotting
were 27.8 %, 95.6%, 83.3 % and 62.3 %, respectively.
Detection of antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence
Antibodies to CAGT were detected in 35 patients with
invasive candidiasis (group 1) (97.2 %). These patients

had titers of antibodies to CAGT ranging 1:20 to 1:20480,
and in 29 patients (80.6 %), the titer was ≥ 1:160. Group
1 patients showing antibodies to CAGT ≤ 1:160 were
mainly infected by non-C. albicans species, including C.
parapsilosis, C. guilliermondii, C. krusei and C. tropicalis
(Table 1). Only 4 out of 45 (8.9 %) patients without evi-
dence of invasive candidiasis (group 2) had antibodies to
CAGT at titer ≥ 1:160 (Table 2).
Considering a cutoff value of = 1:160, the sensitivity, spe-
cificity, positive and negative predictive values of a diag-
nostic test based on the detection of antibodies to CAGT
were 80.6 %, 91.1 %, 87.9 % and 85.4 %, respectively.
Detection of antibodies by ELISA
In an attempt to increase the low sensitivity of the detec-
tion of antibodies against the N-Hwp1 fragment by
immunoblotting, we developed and ELISA assay for the
diagnosis invasive candidiasis. The cutoff value was
defined as the mean plus 3 times the standard deviation
of the relative absorbance values of the sera obtained from
patients without evidence of candidiasis. Relative absorb-
ance values above the cutoff were considered positive
whereas results under the cutoff were negative. Thirty-two
out of 36 patients from group 1 (88.9 %) were positive by
the ELISA test (Table 1). Two patients infected with C. albi-
cans and one patient each infected with C. guilliermondii
and C. krusei were negative by this assay (Table 1). Eight
out of 45 patients from group 2 tested (17.8 %) showed
false positive results by ELISA (Table 2). Group I patients
showed higher amounts of antibodies against N-Hwp1
fragment than patients from group II, since the mean plus
standard deviation were 1.7 ± 0.7 and 0.7 ± 0.4, respec-
tively (P < 0.01).
The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive
values of a diagnostic test based on the detection of anti-
bodies to the N-Hwp1 fragment by ELISA were 88.9 %,
82.6 %, 80.0 % and 90.2 %, respectively. Patients infected
with C. albicans were more likely to have antibodies to the
N-Hwp1 fragment above the cutoff value. In fact, if only
patients infected with C. albicans were taken into consid-
eration, the sensitivity and negative predictive value of the
test increased to 91.3 % and 94.9 %, while the specificity
remained unaltered.
In a subgroup of 14 group 1 patients, the availability of
serial serum samples allowed to study the kinetics of anti-
body response to the N-Hwp1 fragment by ELISA and to
CAGT. Antibody titers became positive before the diagno-
sis of invasive candidiasis was made in 9 patients by ELISA
and in 6 patients by indirect immunofluorescence. Inter-
estingly, the kinetics of antibody response to the N-Hwp1
fragment of by ELISA was very similar to that observed by
indirect immunofluorescence and antibody titers showed
a constant rise around the time the clinical and microbio-
logical evidence of invasive candidiasis existed and then
fell below the cutoff value if the patient responded to anti-
fungal therapy. The kinetics of antibody response in a
patient with invasive candidiasis is shown in Fig. 2.
The relationship between the results obtained by ELISA
and indirect immunofluorescence is shown in Figure 3. In
patients infected with C. albicans, results obtained by both
techniques showed a good agreement since only three
patients (12.5 %) were positive by only one technique. In
patients infected with non-albicans Candida species, the
agreement was lower since four patients (33.3 %) were
positive by ELISA but negative by indirect immunofluo-
rescence. Antibody titers obtained with both techniques
were lower for patients infected with non-albicans species
than for those infected with C. albicans.
Homology between C. albicans Hwp1 and other Candida
proteins
The presence in patients infected by non-albicans Candida
species of antibodies that cross-react with C. albicans N-
Hwp1 may be explained by the existence of common
epitopes in C. albicans Hwp1 and other proteins present in
non-albicans Candida species. To test this hypothesis we
searched the GenBank database for homology between C.
albicans Hwp1 and other Candida proteins. Interestingly,
the region encoding the first 85 amino acid residues of
Hwp1 showed homology with the sequence of proteins of
C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. glabrata and C. lipolytica (Fig.
4).
Discussion
Due to the commensal nature of members of genus Cand-
ida, the key factor in the laboratory diagnosis of invasive
candidiasis is the differentiation between infection and
colonization. From a serological point of view, this differ-
entiation may be facilitated if different types of antibodies
are detected in each situation. Our group has previously
reported the detection of antibodies to CAGT, which are
usually detected in patients with invasive candidiasis at
titers ≥ 160 and are absent or detected at very low titers in
patients without invasive candidiasis despite of being col-
onized by Candida spp. [6,10,18]. The basis for this dis-
crimination lies on the different antigenic composition of
blastospores and germ tubes of C. albicans, since germ
tubes but not blastospores express a high molecular
weight antigen that induces an antibody response [20].
Due to the mannoproteic nature of the antigen, the detec-
tion of antibodies to CAGT requires the adsorption of
antibodies directed against mannan since they are ubiqui-
tous in human sera [21].
Identification of genes encoding antigens specific for the
hyphal phase of C. albicans has opened new ways to study
BMC Microbiology 2007, 7:35 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/35

the usefulness of these antigens in the serological diagno-
sis of invasive candidiasis. For example, they can be
obtained in recombinant form which, in addition to the
availability of highly standardized reagents, will be non-
glycosylated when they have been expressed in E. coli. The
lack of glycosylation of these recombinant antigens is
important because the adsorption of the sera to remove
the anti-mannan antibodies will not be necessary, an
important improvement when the ELISA test is compared
to the detection of antibodies to CAGT.
C. albicans HWP1 is one of the phase-specific genes most
studied. The glycoprotein encoded by this gene is specifi-
cally expressed on the cell wall surface of germ tubes and
hyphae of C. albicans [22], and may be required for viru-
lence in systemic candidiasis [23]. Its location on the cell
wall surface may facilitate the production of antibodies
against this protein by the C. albicans-infected host. Since
the protein has a surface-exposed N-terminal domain that
binds antibodies while the carboxyl terminus is most
probably covalently integrated in cell wall [11], we
selected that fragment of Hwp1 for our serological studies.
The molecular mass of the N-Hwp1 was determined to be
38 kDa, much larger than the calculated 22 kDa. The same
discrepancy was observed with the rHwp1N13KV-c~myc
fragment used as control, since it yielded a protein of 34
kDa when the predicted molecular mass was 20.5 kDA.
The lack of agreement between the predicted molecular
mass and the SDS-PAGE-determined molecular mass has
been reported previously and is related to the high proline
content of Hwp1 [11]. The peculiar migration of the N-
terminal fragments of Hwp1 in SDS-PAGE gels seems to
be also responsible for the doublet revealed in the West-
ern blots by the anti-N-Hwp1 antiserum and by sera from
patients with invasive candidiasis. Both bands of each
doublet are likely to be the same protein since they also

reacted with the monoclonal antisera against the tag
sequences of N-Hwp1 and rHwp1N13KV-c~myc proteins.
Interestingly, a proline-rich antigen from Coccidioides
immitis expressed in E. coli also migrated as a doublet in
SDS-PAGE gels [24].
The diagnostic potential of the detection of antibodies
against the N-Hwp1 fragment was studied by two differ-
ent techniques: immunoblotting and ELISA. While detec-
tion of antibodies by immunoblotting showed a very
poor sensitivity and negative predictive values, detection
of antibodies against the N-terminal fragment of Hwp1 by
ELISA notably increased the diagnostic validity, with sen-
sitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values
of 88.9 %, 82.6 %, 80.0 % and 90.5 %, respectively. Inter-
estingly, these results were very close to those obtained by
detecting antibodies to CAGT by indirect immunofluores-
cence. The kinetics of antibody response to CAGT antigens
was also similar to that of antibodies against the recom-
binant protein. In some patients, antibody titers showed a
constant rise in association with the clinical and micro-
biological diagnosis of invasive candidiasis and then
decreased and eventually fell under the cut-off level if the
patient responded to antifungal therapy. These results are
in agreement with previously reported results detecting
antibodies to CAGT by indirect immunofluorescence
[6,10,18,25-27]. The relationship between the results
obtained by detecting antibodies to N-Hwp1 and CAGT
was higher in patients infected with C. albicans than in
patients infected with non-albicans Candida species. In
both cases, the majority of the discrepancies were due to
the highest sensitivity of the ELISA, since six patients were
positive by ELISA and negative by indirect immunofluo-
rescence. Four of the six patients were infected with non-

albicans Candida species, confirming previous observa-
tions that non-albicans Candida species induce lower titers
of antibodies to CAGT [26-28].
False negative results by indirect immunofluorescence
were observed in a group of patients who were infected by
non-albicans Candida species. These results are in agree-
ment with previously published results [26,27]. This is
despite evidence that most clinically relevant non-albicans
Candida species including C. stellatoidea, C. guilliermondii,
C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. krusei grown at 37°C
have antigens that cross-react with those present in the C.
albicans germ tube cell wall [28]. Interestingly, the ELISA
test demonstrated that antibodies to the N-terminal frag-
ment of C. albicans Hwp1 are detected in patients with
infections by non-albicans Candida species including C.
parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. utilis, C. glabrata and C. dub-
liniensis. The reasons for this reactivity are presently
unknown since Hwp1 is exclusively synthesized during
hyphal growth of C. albicans [11]. However, most clini-
cally relevant Candida species, including C. glabrata, can
produce pseudomycelium [29,30] and it has been recently
reported that HWP1 mRNA may also arise from pseudo-
hyphal growth forms in C. albicans, or possibly from yeast
forms, although experimental data to support the pres-
ence of HWP1 mRNA in yeast forms has not been
reported [31]. It may be possible that under certain condi-
tions, some non-albicans Candida species express antigens
that elicit antibodies that cross-react with C. albicans
Hwp1. In agreement with this, Moran et al. [32] have
recently identified in C. dubliniensis an ORF of 1266 bp
with homology to C. albicans Hwp1, especially in the
region encoding the first 50 residues of each protein, and
we have observed that the region encoding the first 85
amino acid residues of Hwp1 shows homology with the
sequence of proteins of a number of non-albicans Candida

species including C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. glabrata and
C. lipolytica.The existence of antibodies that cross-react
with C. albicans Hwp1 in patients infected by non-albicans
Candida species does not seem to decrease the specificity
of the ELISA test developed in this study, since these anti-
bodies seem to be present mostly in patients with invasive
candidiasis. On the contrary, the existence of this cross-
reactivity can be used to increase the sensitivity of the test,
especially in a time when infections by non-albicans Can-
dida species are increasing [33]. However, further studies
investigating the induction of C. albicans Hwp1-like anti-
gens by non-albicans Candida species are warranted.
The high sensitivity and specificity showed by the ELISA
test developed in this study to detect antibodies against
the N-terminal fragment of Hwp1 in the diagnosis of inva-
sive candidiasis seem to be useful to detect the low levels
of antibodies that may be present in hematological
patients. However, an increase in both parameters might
be obtained by detecting antibodies against other C. albi-
cans germ tube specific antigens such as Als3p [12], Ece1p
[13] and/or Hyr1p [14]. A mixture of all these antigens
may be used in the same ELISA in order to optimize the
result. Alternatively, an increase in the sensitivity can be
obtained by combining the detection of antibodies to the
N-terminal fragment of Hwp1 with a test that detects Can-
dida antigens.
Conclusion
This study shows that is possible to develop an ELISA test
that allows the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis by detect-
ing antibodies to the N-terminal fragment of C. albicans
Hwp1. This test is simpler to perform than the detection
of antibodies to CAGT since it does not need the adsorp-
tion of the patient's serum and allows both an objective
measurement and the automatization of the test.
Methods
Strains, plasmids and culture media
Candida albicans SC5314 [16] was used as fungal DNA
source in this study and was grown in medium 199
(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo, USA) at 24°C and
120 rpm. C. albicans NCPF 3153 (National Collection of
Pathogenic Fungi, Bristol, UK) was used in some experi-
ments in order to remove antibodies against the cell wall
surface of the blastospore.
Escherichia coli (DE3) pLacI (Novagen, Darmstadt, Ger-
many) was used as the host strain for the expression of the
recombinant plasmid (pTriEx-1® vector, Novagen). E. coli
cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (1% w/v
Tryptone, 1% NaCl, 0.5 % yeast extract, pH 7.0) or LB agar
plates (LB and 1.5% agar, pH 7.0) supplemented, when
necessary, with carbenicillin (50 µg/ml) and chloram-
phenicol (34 µg/ml) (Sigma).
Cloning, expression and purification of the N-terminal and
internal fragments of recombinant Hwp1
Primers (5'-GATATCCTCTTATGATTACTATCAAGAACC-
3' and 5'-GGAATTCCCGTTTGGAGTAGCTGGAGT-3')
were designed in order to clone the N-terminal fragment
of the HWP1 coding sequence (N-Hwp1, from nucleotide
118 to 600, without the signal sequence). The amplified
PCR product was digested with EcoRI and EcoRV restric-
tion enzymes (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and purified
using QIAquick PCR purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA, USA). The HWP1 fragment was cloned into the sites
of pTriEx-1® vector containing His·tag® and HSV·tag®
sequences (Novagen) to enable the construction of a C-
terminal tagged fusion protein. To confirm the sequence
of the insert and the frame of the recombinant tagged pro-
tein, the plasmid was sequenced by using primers flank-
ing the polylinker region of the pTriEx-1® plasmid. An
internal fragment of HWP1 (int-Hwp1, from nucleotide
592 to 1050) was cloned using primers 5'-GATATC-
CACTCCAAACATTCCTGCTACA-3' and 5'-GGAATTC-
CCAGTCAATGGACAGTAAGTGGT-3', as stated for N-
Hwp1.
E. coli cells were transformed with the plasmids contain-
ing the fragments of the HWP1 gene and were grown over-
night in LB medium containing both carbenicillin and
chloramphenicol in order to make the medium selective
for the recombinant strains, at 37°C and 180 rpm. The
cultures were used as inoculum of fresh LB medium and
incubated up to an OD600 of 0.7–0.8. At this moment, the
expression of the Hwp1 recombinant fragments was
induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside
(Sigma). After 3.5 h of induction, cells were harvested by
centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1.5 min and resuspended
in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline pH 7.2 (PBS). Pro-
tein extracts were checked for the presence of the recom-
binant Hwp1 fragments by sodium dodecyl sulfate-
polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).
The recombinant His6-tagged Hwp1 fragments were puri-
fied by nickelchelate affinity chromatography in accord-
ance to manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). Fractions
containing the purified polypeptides were pooled, dia-
lyzed against PBS and stored at -20°C.
A purified recombinant Hwp1 N-terminal fragment
(rHwp1N13KV-c~myc) provided by Dr. Paula Sundstrom
(Dartmouth Medical School, Department of Microbiol-
ogy and Immunology, Hanover, NH, USA) was used to
confirm the identity of the recombinant N-Hwp1 frag-
ment produced for this study. The rHwp1N13KV-c~myc
fragment was cloned from nucleotide 121 to 576 and pro-
duced in Pichia pastoris using the pPICZ alphaC vector
containing c~Myc and 6x-His tags at the carboxy terminus

(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (unpublished results, personal
communication).
Patients
We retrospectively studied 342 sera, stored at -20°C until
use, from 81 different adult hematological cancer or
Intensive Care Unit patients at increased risk for invasive
candidiasis. Patients were divided into two groups,
according to clinical and microbiological diagnostic data.
Group 1 included 36 patients (193 sera) with invasive
candidiasis, which was proven by a positive Candida spp.
blood culture (Table 1). Group 2 was the control group
and comprised 45 different patients (149 sera) who did
not have clinical or microbiological data to document
invasive candidiasis (Table 2). Only sera to be studied by
IFA were adsorbed previously with heat-killed blast-
ospores of C. albicans (see below).
Rabbit antiserum
A polyclonal antiserum against the purified recombinant
N-Hwp1 fragment was obtained in a New Zealand White
rabbit immunized subcutaneously with a suspension con-
taining 0.2 mg of protein in 0.5 ml of saline and 0.5 ml of
complete Freund's adjuvant. After the first immunization,
the rabbit was injected three more times every two weeks
with 0.1 mg of protein in 0.5 ml of saline and 0.5 ml of
incomplete Freund's adjuvant. A preimmune serum was
obtained before immunization, and samples of immune
serum were extracted weekly from the ear marginal veins
of the rabbit. Pre-immune serum did not react with the
recombinant Hwp1 fragments by immunoblotting. The
animal study was performed in accord with the guidelines
of the Department of Agriculture of the Basque Govern-
ment.
Immunoblot assay
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE by the method of
Laemmli [17] in a minigel system. Electrophoresis of the
purified Hwp1 recombinant fragments was done in 10%
acrylamide gels at 200 V. The proteins were transferred to
Immobilon® membranes (Millipore Ibérica, Madrid,
Spain) and incubated with human sera diluted 1:100 in
0.1 M Tris-buffered saline (TBS) supplemented with 8%
nonfat dry milk pH 7.2 for 1 h at 37°C with slow agita-
tion. After three washes with TBS, the membranes were
incubated with horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) conjugated
anti-human immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies (Sigma)
for 1 h at 37°C. They were washed again and the immu-
noreactive bands were visualized with 4-chloro-1-naphtol
(Sigma). After visual inspection of the blots, sera were
qualified as positive if a band of 36–38 kDa was present.
A similar protocol was used with the rabbit anti-N-Hwp1
serum and the mouse monoclonal antibodies anti-HSV
(Novagen) and anti-c-Myc (Exbio Praha, Vestec, Czech
Republic) used to identify the recombinant proteins. In
these cases, the HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
were directed against rabbit IgG (Sigma) and mouse IgG
(Sigma), respectively.
Indirect immunofluorescence assay
It was carried out essentially as previously described [18].
Antibodies to CAGT were detected by an indirect immun-
ofluorescence assay (Candida IFA IgG, Laboratorios Vir-
cell S.A., Granada, Spain). Briefly, every serum was
adsorbed with 19 volumes of heat-killed blastospores of
C. albicans NCPF 3153 in order to remove antibodies
against the blastospore cell wall surface and allow the
detection of germ tube surface specific antibodies.
Adsorbed sera and its serial double dilutions were applied
to each well of the immunofluorescence slides and incu-
bated at 37°C for 30 min in a wet chamber. The slides
were washed in PBS and incubated with FITC-conjugated
goat anti-human IgG at 37°C for another 30 min in a wet
chamber. The slides were washed again and examined
with a microscope equipped for epifluorescence. The titer
assigned to each serum was the highest dilution of the
serum showing fluorescence on the entire C. albicans germ
tube cell wall surface. Patients were judged positive when
reverse titers of CAGT were 160 in at least one serum sam-
ple.
ELISA
Preliminary checkerboard titration experiments were per-
formed to determine optimal concentration of the anti-
gen, by comparing known positive and negative human
sera. Microtiter vinyl plates (Costar, Cambridge, Mass,
USA) were coated with the purified recombinant N-Hwp1
fragment (0.3 µg/ml). The antigen was diluted in 0.05 M
sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and a 100 µl volume
was added to each well and it was incubated at 4°C over-
night. After coating, the wells were washed once with PBS
and blocked with 100 µl of PBS supplemented with 1%
bovine serum albumin (PBSB) at 37°C for 1 h. Sera were
diluted 1:1000 in PBSB supplemented with 0.05% Tween
20 (PBSBT) and assayed in triplicate (100 µl/well). After 1
h of incubation at 37°C, the wells were washed three
times with PBSBT. A volume of 100 µl of a 1:1000 dilu-
tion of HRP-conjugated human anti IgG (Sigma) in
PBSBT was added to each well and the plates were incu-
bated at 37°C for 1 h. The plates were then washed three
times with PBSBT followed by the addition of 100 µl of
the substrate solution, containing 0.05 M citric acid, 0.1 M
di-sodium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous, 0.05 % of 30
% hydrogen peroxide and 0.05 % o-phenylenediamine
(Sigma) to each well. The plates were incubated at room
temperature for 30 min in darkness. The reaction was
stopped by the addition of 50 µl per well of 0.5 M sulphu-
ric acid and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm

using an automated ELISA plate reader (Microplate
Autoreader, Bio-Tek Instruments, Montpelier, Vermont,
USA). Results were expressed as a relative absorbance
index calculated by dividing the absorbance of the sample
by the absorbance of a reference serum.
Statistics
Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predic-
tive values were calculated as described by Kozinn et al.
[19]. Mean values of relative absorbance of both groups
were compared by the t test (Microsoft Excel), values of P
< 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
