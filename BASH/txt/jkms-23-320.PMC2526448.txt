INTRODUCTION
Acquired aplastic anemia is characterized by the depletion
of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells, the hypocel-
lularity of bone marrow and blood pancytopenia, and it com-
monly occurs in children and young adults (1). The standard
treatments are hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
or immunosuppressive therapy in patients with life-threat-
ening cytopenia. HSCT is the treatment of choice in young
patients with an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched
sibling or unrelated stem cell donor and immunosuppressive
therapy is indicated for patients without HLA-matched donor
or older patients (1, 2). However, patients who relapsed despite
these treatments or those who did not receive such active
therapies depend on continuous blood transfusions, and they
are ultimately fatal because of its natural clinical course, clon-
al evolution to other malignant diseases (3), or secondary
complications such as hemochromatosis (4).
A very poor prognosis may be predicted in patients with
severe aplastic anemia (SAA) in whom major organ failures
occurred by multiple blood transfusions. Can the only sup-
portive therapies such as blood component transfusions
including packed red blood cell (PRBC) and continuous
iron chelation be possible in normalizing the disease and
recovering organ failures? The answer may be no. However,
we experienced an interesting finding in a patient with SAA
using a continuous iron chelation therapy. We expect that
the therapy will be an alternative answer to this problem on
the aspect of stem cell immunobiology. In addition, the same
treatment protocol has been applied to other similar patients
from our hospital, in whom a gradual improvement is being
noted and a follow-up monitoring is needed.
CASE REPORT
In 1998, a 16-yr-old male patient visited our emergency
center with a chief complaint of severe dyspnea. He was diag-
nosed with SAA at 11 yr of age. According to his medical
record, his bone marrow was markedly hypocellular (<10%
cellularity) without dysplastic features, and the Ham’s and
sucrose tests were negative. He received twice of ALG im-
munotherapies and supportive erythropoietin injections, but
did not have any responses. He neither had an HLA-matched
sibling stem cell donor nor found an unrelated stem cell donor
despite continuous search. He was given oral oxymetholone

Complete Hematopoietic Recovery after Continuous Iron Chelation
Therapy in a Patient with Severe Aplastic Anemia with Secondary
Hemochromatosis
A 16-yr-old male patient with hemochromatosis due to multiple packed red blood cell
transfusions was referred to our emergency center for the treatment of severe aplas-
tic anemia and dyspnea. He was diagnosed with aplastic anemia at 11-yr of age.
He had received continuous transfusions because an HLA-matched marrow donor
was unavailable. Following a continuous, approximately 5-yr transfusion, he was
noted to develop hemochromatosis. He had a dilated cardiomyopathy and required
diuretics and digitalis, multiple endocrine and liver dysfunction, generalized bleed-
ing, and skin pigmentation. A total volume of red blood cell transfusion before defer-
oxamine therapy was about 96,000 mL. He received a regular iron chelation thera-
py (continuous intravenous infusion of deferoxamine, 50 mg/kg/day for 5 days q 3-4
weeks) for approximately seven years after the onset of multiple organ failures. His
cytopenia and organ dysfunctions began to be gradually recovered since about
2002, following a 4-yr deferoxamine treatment. He showed completely normal
ranges of peripheral blood cell counts, heart size, and liver function two years ago.
He has not received any transfusions for the last four years. This finding suggests
that a continuous deferoxamine infusion may play a role in the immune regulation
in addition to iron chelation effect.

and continuously had two pints of PRBC transfusion at a 1-
to 2-week interval for five years while awaiting an HLA-
matched unrelated stem cell donor. The total volume of PRBC
(320-400 mL/pack) transfusion was approximately 96,000
mL during that period. Initial electrocardiography showed
atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 150/min. The chest
radiography showed huge cardiomegaly with 80% of car-
dio-thoracic ratio and both pleural effusions (Fig. 1), and
the erect and supine view of abdomen radiography showed
a severe hepatomegaly. An echocardiographic examination
presented 4% of left ventricular ejection fraction with severe-
ly dilated left ventricle and nearly akinetic cardiac wall move-
ment. Laboratory tests showed 4.5 g/dL of hemoglobin, 20×
109
/L of absolute reticulocyte count, 2.7×109
/L of white
blood cell count (absolute neutrophil count, 0.3×109
/L), 3
×109
/L of platelet count, 407 mg/dL of fasting blood glu-
cose-level, and 68,800 ng/mL of serum ferritin.
We immediately admitted him to our intensive care unit.
He received appropriate doses of oxygen, digitalis, diuretics,
and a continuous intravenous infusion of insulin in addition
to levothyroxine, calcium, and vitamin D of his previous pre-
scriptions. Other laboratory tests showed 0.37 ng/dL of serum
free thyroxine (normal range, 0.8 to 1.9 ng/dL), 142.2 mIU/L
of thyrotropin (normal range, 0.4 to 4 mIU/L), 6.0 mg/dL of
serum calcium level (normal range, 8.2 to 10.2 mg/dL), 13
pg/mL of intact PTH (normal range, 15 to 70 pg/mL), and
8.4% of hemoglobin A1C (normal range, 4 to 6%). These find-
ings were suggestive of multiple endocrine dysfunctions includ-
ing hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism with hypocalcemia,
and diabetes. Liver function tests were 2.5 mg/dL of serum
total bilirubin, 2.8 g/dL of serum albumin, prolonged pro-
thrombin time of 16.4 sec (normal range, 11.1 to 13.1 sec)
and 1.437 INR (normal range, 0.9 to 1.12), 35.1 sec of acti-
vated partial thromboplastin time (normal range, 25 to 38
sec), 649 IU/L of serum aspartate aminotransferase (normal
range, 8 to 40 IU/L), and 539 IU/L of serum alanine amino-
transferase (normal range, 5 to 40 IU/L). Ophthalmologic
examination confirmed a cataract in both eyes. Generalized
skin pigmentation was seen in his skin. Abdominal ultrasonog-
raphy showed severe hepatomegaly with increased parenchy-
mal echogenecity. Based on these findings, he was diagnosed
with secondary hemochromatosis accompanied by multiple
organ failures which resulted from iron deposition in body
organs due to multiple PRBC transfusions. Based on some
published reports that iron chelation plays a prominent role
inhemochromatosis(5,6),hereceiveda12-hrcontinuousintra-
venous infusion of deferoxamine (50 mg/kg/day) for five days
at a 4-week interval. He received PRBC during deferoxamine
treatment, if necessary. He also received innumerable units of
platelet concentrates. Thereafter, he was frequently admitted
to the medical intensive care unit through our emergency cen-
ter because of the aggravated symptoms and signs of heart fail-
ure and diabetes-related complications, multiple cerebral and
subdural hematomas, and seizure. Meanwhile, he was being
given a 7-yr deferoxamine treatment. The frequency of his
hospitalization was markedly being lowered, and his hema-
tologic profiles (Fig. 2) and heart size were beginning to nearly
normalize after an approximately 4-yr deferoxamine treatment.
His insulin requirement also decreased, and from then, a low-
dose erythropoietin injection was initiated. Since then, he has
only received outpatient care. He was noted to have completely
normal ranges of peripheral blood cell counts, heart size, and

ized heart after the deferoxamine therapy (B).

liver functions two years ago. A defective expression of CD55/
59 was not observed on either granulocytes or erythrocytes
of peripheral blood. Since the event of complete response, his
bone marrow aspirate and biopsy for the evaluation of bone
marrow status has not been performed because of his strong
refusal. He has not required any blood transfusions over the
past four years (Fig. 3). He currently shows normal reference
ranges of all hematologic and other laboratory tests.
DISCUSSION
The prognosis of SAA is very fatal if its therapy is the only
supportive one such as transfusions. A few patients with
aplastic anemia have been reported to recover spontaneously
without specific therapy, but these remissions usually occur
within the first 7 weeks and the remainder followed a rapidly
fatal course (7). Only 1/3-1/2 of them may be alive six months
after the diagnosis, and about 80% die within 18 months to
two years as described in many reports. Even patients who
survive infections or bleeding also lead to a dangerous situa-
tion because of secondary hemochromatosis associated with
multiple major organ failures. It is very surprising that a
continuous, several-year iron chelation combined with low-
dose erythropoietin injection improves major organ dys-
functions and produces a complete recovery of hematologic
abnormalities. Moreover, these promising results are being
noted gradually in other two patients undergoing the simi-
lar disease situations.
It has been reported that iron chelator not only removes iron
deposited in the tissues but also plays a role in immunologic
mechanisms in spite of some controversy. Carotenuto et al.
reported that deferoxamine acts as a blocker for IL-2 recep-
tor of human T-lymphocytes, and Hoffbrand et al. indicated
the immunosuppressive effect of deferoxamine in inhibiting
the activity of ribonucleotide reductase in human lymphocytes
(8, 9). These reports indicate the immunologic inhibitory effects
of deferoxamine.
We have postulated that the deferoxamine treatment grad-
ually had an immunologic influence on the suppressive envi-
ronment of aplastic marrow and changed bone marrow stro-
mal environment into positive hematopoiesis. In addition,
erythropoietin therapy might have enhanced hematopoietic
proliferation (10, 11). There are some evidences supporting
our postulates: according to Aucella et al., the combination
therapy using deferoxamine and recombinant erythropoietin
promotes synergistically erythropoiesis in patients with chron-
ic renal failure. Kling et al. also noted that iron deprivation
increases erythropoietin production in normal subjects and
patients with malignancy (12, 13). It is very surprising that
a continuous iron chelation induces the recovery of organ dys-
functions. This was previously supported by Tsironi et al. who
reported that combined iron chelation reversed heart failure
in patients with thalassemia major (14). This makes us spec-
ulate that a continuous, long-term infusion of iron chelator
can cause a partial or complete recovery of multiple organ fail-
ures due to iron deposition.
We suggest that an early introduction of continuous iron
chelation could prevent secondary hemochromatosis due to
multiple transfusions and also reverse their hematopoiesis by
its immune modulation effect in patients with refractory or
relapsed aplastic anemia who did not respond to any treatments,
those who did not find an available HLA-matched stem cell
donor, or those who relapsed into the original disease despite
the treatments.
