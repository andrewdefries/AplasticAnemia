Graft-Versus-Host Disease:
A Surge of Developments
Stanley R. Riddell, Frederick R. Appelbaum*
Introduction
This year approximately 20,000
individuals will receive an allogeneic
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)
as treatment for a malignant, or
life-threatening non-malignant,
hematopoietic disease. The process
of HCT generally begins with
administration of a preparative regimen
to eradicate the underlying disease
and immunosuppress the patient
in order to prevent rejection of the
subsequently transfused hematopoietic
stem cells. Following HCT, donor T
cells transplanted with or developing
from the hematopoietic stem cells
react with cells of the human leukocyte
antigen (HLA)-matched but genetically
non-identical host, providing a
beneﬁcial graft-versus-tumor (GVT)
response but also resulting in possibly
life-threatening graft-versus-host
disease (GVHD). The manifestations
of GVHD vary over its course. Acute
GVHD usually appears within several
weeks of HCT and is characterized
by a diffuse maculopapular rash,
mucosal inﬂammation causing crampy
abdominal pain and diarrhea, and
elevated liver function tests (Figure
1). GVHD that ﬁrst appears or
persists more than three months after
allogeneic HCT is termed chronic
GVHD and resembles a chronic
autoimmune disorder. Patients
frequently develop lichen planus
skin lesions, ocular and oral sicca,
obliterative bronchiolitis, and hepatic
abnormalities resembling primary
biliary sclerosis.
If no immunosuppression is given
after allogeneic HCT, life-threatening
or fatal GVHD inevitably develops. The
ﬁrst successful application of allogeneic
HCT to treat human leukemia in the
early 1970s was made possible by the
use of methotrexate, administered early
after transplantation as prophylaxis
against GVHD [1]. In the mid-1980s,
prospective randomized trials were
performed demonstrating that a
combination of a calcineurin inhibitor
(cyclosporin or tacrolimus) plus
methotrexate was superior to either
agent alone in preventing acute GVHD
[2,3], and such combinations remain
the standard of care today. Despite
such prophylaxis, approximately 50%
of patients receiving HCT will develop
acute GVHD sufﬁciently severe to
require additional immunosuppression,
usually in the form of a corticosteroid,
and approximately 50% of patients
will develop chronic GVHD requiring
continued immunosuppression for
up to several years. The majority of
patients eventually develop tolerance,
and immunosuppression can be
completely withdrawn in these cases,
but 10%–20% of recipients of HLA-
matched hematopoietic cell transplants
will die of refractory GVHD or of
opportunistic infections associated with
its prevention or treatment, and the
mortality rate increases with increasing
donor–recipient HLA disparity.
An elusive goal of research has
been to ﬁnd ways to prevent GVHD
without dramatically increasing other
transplant complications. Most clinical
studies to date have focused on the
use of alternative immunosuppressants
or removal of T cells from the donor
stem cell source. More intensive
post-transplant immunosuppressive
regimens and T cell depletion are
both capable of dramatically reducing
the incidence and severity of GVHD,
but do so at the cost of an increased
incidence of fatal post-transplant
infections and tumor recurrence.
Increased graft rejection may also
occur if donor T cells are removed
from the donor stem cell graft, because
the reaction of these cells against

residual host immune cells contributes
to engraftment. More intensive
preparative regimens can overcome
this problem but are associated with
increased toxicity. More potent
post-transplant immunosuppressive
regimens and T cell depletion suppress
or remove immunocompetent cells
responsible for protection against many
pathogens as well as cell populations
that contribute to the beneﬁcial GVT
response. Accordingly, in retrospective
analyses and prospective randomized
trials, neither more intensive post-
transplant immunosuppression nor T
cell depletion has been demonstrated
to improve survival following allogeneic
HCT [4]. While it is the case that
fewer patients succumb to GVHD
and associated complications today
than did a decade ago, this is largely
due to improvements in HLA-typing
technology and supportive care
measures rather than advances in the
direct prevention and treatment of
GVHD. Recent clinical and animal
model studies have provided several
novel and surprising insights into the
biology of GVHD and provide exciting
new directions for strategies that may
prevent GVHD without increasing
complications.
Haplotype Matching
One area of progress, as noted above,
has been in HLA-typing technology
and donor selection. Historically, HLA
typing was conducted using serologic
methods, but with the advent of the
polymerase chain reaction assay in the
1980s, it became possible to perform
molecular typing of donor and
recipient. When patients previously
transplanted from serologically matched
donors were retrospectively analyzed
using molecular typing, approximately
30% were found to be mismatched with
the donor for one or more alleles, and
such mismatching was shown to lead to
more GVHD and poorer survival [5].
Thus, molecular typing of the HLA
locus has become the standard of care.
Even with the use of molecular typing
to identify fully HLA-matched donors,
unrelated donor transplants continue
to be associated with more GVHD
than seen with HLA-matched sibling
transplants. Using a novel technique
that allows for the typing of individual
DNA strands, Petersdorf et al. have
now shown that among allele-matched
unrelated donor–recipient pairs, those
that shared the same physical linkage of
HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 were much less
likely to develop severe GVHD (Figure
2) [6]. These results imply that other
unidentiﬁed transplantation antigens
exist within the same genetic region as
HLA, and offer a method for improved
selection among HLA-matched
unrelated donors.
Genetic Proﬁling
The pathogenesis of GVHD involves the
expansion and differentiation of donor
T cells reacting in peripheral lymphoid
tissues against host antigen-presenting
cells that display disparate minor
histocompatibility antigens. These
antigen-presenting cells are activated as
a consequence of tissue injury and the
resulting release of proinﬂammatory
cytokines [7]. Polymorphisms in
cytokine genes between donor and
recipient may inﬂuence the host
inﬂammatory response to tissue
injury and the severity of GVHD. The
interleukin-10 (IL-10) pathway is the
most extensively studied, and speciﬁc
polymorphisms in the recipient IL-
10 promoter region as well as in the
donor IL-10 receptor beta gene have
each been found to be associated
with a lower risk of GVHD and non-
relapse mortality [8,9]. Polymorphisms
in other immune regulatory genes,
including those encoding interleukin-6,
interferon gamma, and tumor necrosis
factor-alpha, have also been suggested
to inﬂuence the development of GVHD
[10].
In an effort to provide a more global
assessment of whether a donor is likely
to induce GVHD, Baron et al. have
examined gene expression proﬁles of
CD4 and CD8 T cells from donors and

report that it is possible to segregate
donors into those likely to cause GVHD
and those who are relatively safe [11].
If this ability to discriminate between
strong and weak alloresponders is
veriﬁed in further studies, these
ﬁndings could have important
implications for donor selection.
Donor Graft Manipulation
Stem cell grafts contain distinct
functional and phenotypic subsets of T
cells, including antigen-inexperienced
naïve T cells (TN
), antigen-experienced
memory T cells, (TM
), and regulatory
T cells (TREG
). Recent studies have
begun to dissect the contribution of
these individual T cell subsets to GVHD
and have identiﬁed opportunities
for more reﬁned manipulation of
the T cell content of stem cell grafts
that may reduce GVHD without the
severe T cell deﬁciency associated
with complete depletion (Figure 3).
For example, the selective depletion
of TN
from allogeneic stem cell
grafts abrogated GVHD in both
CD4- and CD8-dependent multiple
minor histocompatibility antigen–
mismatched mouse models, and the
remaining TM
provided reconstitution
of immunity to pathogens [12,13].
Human TN
and TM
can also be
distinguished based on phenotype—
TN
are CD45RA+ and CD62L+,
while TM
are CD45RO+ and either
CD62L+ or CD62L-, and emerging
data suggest that alloreactivity for
minor histocompatibility antigens is
predominantly contained in the TN
subset [14]. The human TM
repertoire
comprises less than 1% of the overall
T cell receptor diversity and consists
of large numbers of T cells speciﬁc
for cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr
virus, and other pathogens that cause
opportunistic infections in HCT
recipients [15]. Thus, unless the
donor has been previously sensitized
to recipient minor histocompatibility
antigens (which would convert
alloreactive naïve T cells to the
memory pool), transplants using stem
cells depleted of naïve T cells could
reduce or eliminate GVHD while
preserving the transfer of memory T
cells to common infectious agents.
Such transplants would overcome a
major limitation of transplantation
using complete T cell depletion. The
recognition that donor CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+
TREG
cells suppress T cell
responses in vitro and in vivo suggests
another attractive approach to donor
graft manipulation for preventing
GVHD. The importance of TREG
in
GVHD is supported by murine studies
showing that their depletion from stem
cell grafts exacerbates GVHD and that
the infusion of additional TREG
at the
time of HCT reduces lethal GVHD,
apparently by limiting the initial
activation of alloreactive T cells in
lymph nodes [16,17]. Clinical studies
have suggested that stem cell grafts
from donors with higher numbers of
TREG
confer a lower risk of GVHD [18],
and efforts are in progress to isolate
and expand populations of human TREG
that might be used to supplement stem
cell grafts and abrogate GVHD [19].
Segregation of GVHD from GVT
Although these new approaches to
allogeneic HCT are likely to reduce
the severity of GVHD, an important
concern for patients undergoing HCT
for a malignant disease is whether
reducing GVHD might increase the risk
of tumor recurrence. Like GVHD, GVT
is the result of donor T cells reacting
with disparate minor histocompatibility
antigens, and elimination of GVHD
would seem almost certain to diminish
the GVT effect. Elucidation of the
molecular structure, HLA restriction,
and tissue expression of human minor
histocompatibility antigens, and the
identiﬁcation of non-polymorphic
leukemia-associated antigens that
can be recognized by T lymphocytes
offers the exciting prospect that
targeted T cell therapy after HCT
might selectively augment GVT activity
[20]. An increasing number of minor
histocompatibility antigens have now
been molecularly characterized, and
novel mechanisms of polypeptide
processing have been uncovered
[21]. Several minor histocompatibility
antigens are expressed in both normal
and malignant hematopoietic cells of
the recipient, but not in epithelium
[22]. Thus, donor T cells reactive with
such tissue-restricted antigens will
target recipient hematopoietic and
leukemic cells without damaging non-
hematopoietic tissues or engrafting

Figure 3. Selective Manipulation of T Cell Subsets in Allogeneic Stem Cell Grafts to Reduce
GVHD while Retaining GVT and Pathogen-Speciﬁc Immunity
Strategies being developed to modify the T cell content of allogeneic stem cell grafts include:
a) depletion of the TN
subset of cells that contain the repertoire of T cells capable of recognizing
minor histocompatibility antigens expressed on skin, gastrointestinal, and hepatic tissues; b)
expanding TREG
cells that interfere with activation of alloreactive T cells to augment the stem cell
graft; c) isolation and expansion of tumor-reactive T cells from naïve T cell progenitors for adoptive
immunotherapy to augment the GVT effect; and d) retention of TM
cells in the graft to restore
protective T cell immunity to pathogens.

donor hematopoietic progenitors.
Techniques for cloning minor
histocompatibility antigen–speciﬁc T
cells have been developed, and these
T cell clones can eliminate primary
human leukemias in immunodeﬁcient
mice [23]. Pilot studies in which
cloned donor T cells reactive with
minor histocompatibility antigens have
been adoptively transferred to treat
patients with post-transplant disease
recurrence have demonstrated the
principle that GVT and GVHD can
be segregated based on the tissue
expression of the target antigen
[24]. The feasibility of this strategy
is advancing with reﬁnements in the
culture methods used for isolating
effector T cells from naïve T cell
precursors and programming these
effector cells for GVT activity. The
identiﬁcation of candidate leukemia
antigens that are not derived from
polymorphic proteins provides
additional targets for T cell therapy
or vaccination that may be broadly
applied [25]. Thus, strategies to
abrogate GVHD and its complications
need not be associated with loss of the
GVT effect, but may instead employ
targeted immunotherapy to reduce the
intensity and duration of post-grafting
immunosuppression while augmenting
GVT activity.
Conclusion
The human graft-versus-host reaction
continues to both fascinate and
frustrate clinical investigation with
its lack of predictability, possibly
lethal toxicity, but potentially life-
saving anti-tumor effects. The ability
to select optimal donors based on
improved HLA-typing technologies
and better understanding of non-HLA
contributions to immune reactivity
seems at hand, and should substantially
reduce the risk of developing severe
GVHD. Clinical studies of donor graft
manipulation removing TN
subsets,
retaining TM
subsets, and possibly
supplementing TREG
subsets are just
being initiated. In the long term,
perhaps the most exciting potential
lies in the segregation of GVHD from
the GVT reaction based on increased
recognition of minor histocompatibility
antigens exclusively expressed on
normal versus malignant hematopoietic
tissues. Whether these new advances
will lead to the hoped-for clinical
victories will become apparent in the
next few years.
