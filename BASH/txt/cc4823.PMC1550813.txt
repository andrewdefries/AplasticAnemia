Abstract
Introduction The diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis,
according to the criteria as defined by the European
Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/
Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG), is difficult to establish in
critically ill patients. The aim of this study is to address the
clinical significance of isolation of Aspergillus spp. from lower
respiratory tract samples in critically ill patients on the basis of
medical and radiological files using an adapted diagnostic
algorithm to discriminate proven and probable invasive
pulmonary aspergillosis from Aspergillus colonisation.
Methods Using a historical cohort (January 1997 to December
2003), all critically ill patients with respiratory tract samples
positive for Aspergillus were studied. In comparison to the
EORTC/MSG criteria, a different appreciation was given to
radiological features and microbiological data, including
semiquantitative cultures and direct microscopic examination of
broncho-alveolar lavage samples.
Results Over a 7 year period, 172 patients were identified with
a positive culture. Of these, 83 patients were classified as
invasive aspergillosis. In 50 of these patients (60%), no high risk
predisposing conditions (neutropenia, hematologic cancer and
stem cell or bone marrow transplantation) were found. Typical
radiological imaging (halo and air-crescent sign) occurred in
only 5% of patients. In 26 patients, histological examination
either by ante-mortem lung biopsy (n = 10) or necropsy (n = 16)
was performed, allowing a rough estimation of the predictive
value of the diagnostic algorithm. In all patients with histology, all
cases of clinical probable pulmonary aspergillosis were
confirmed (n = 17). Conversely, all cases classified as
colonisation had negative histology (n = 9).
Conclusion A respiratory tract sample positive for Aspergillus
spp. in the critically ill should always prompt further diagnostic
assessment, even in the absence of the typical hematological
and immunological host risk factors. In a minority of patients, the
value of the clinical diagnostic algorithm was confirmed by
histological findings, supporting its predictive value. The
proposed diagnostic algorithm needs prospective validation.
Introduction
Aspergillus is a saprophytic filamentous fungus widespread in
the environment. Although Aspergillus can affect any organ
system, the respiratory tract is involved in more than 90% of
affected patients. Inhalation of Aspergillus spores or conidia
can give rise to various clinical conditions, depending essen-
tially on the host's immunological status [1,2]. In immunocom-
petent patients, pulmonary aspergilloma, allergic
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and obstructive bronchial
aspergillosis are described. In immunocompromised patients,
especially with prolonged neutropenia, Aspergillus fumigatus
can invade the pulmonary parenchyma, resulting in invasive
pulmonary aspergillosis, a disease with a high lethality. More
recently, a locally invasive form called necrotizing pulmonary
aspergillosis has been described in patients with mild immu-
nosuppression [1,3-5]. Recent data indicate that invasive
aspergillosis must be considered as an emerging and devas-
tating infectious disease in intensive care unit (ICU) patients
COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; EORTC/MSG = European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study
Group; ICU = intensive care unit.

even in the absence of an apparent predisposing immunodefi-
ciency. In a carefully designed study in a medical ICU, the inci-
dence of invasive aspergillosis was 5.8% ; the majority of
these patients did not have a history of hematological malig-
nancy. [6]. In an autopsy study of ICU patients, 2.7% of
patients were found to have invasive aspergillosis. Chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and advanced liver
cirrhosis were recognised as potential risk factors [7].
The significance of isolation of Aspergillus from respiratory
cultures has been studied extensively in immunocompromised
hosts who develop invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [8-10].
On the other hand, little is known about the significance of iso-
lation of Aspergillus from respiratory specimens of apparently
immunocompetent or mildly immunocompromised patients.
Because species of Aspergillus are ubiquitous, one must be
cautious in ascribing a pathogenic role to the fungus obtained
from a nonsterile site. Therefore, diagnosis of invasive pulmo-
nary aspergillosis on the basis of an Aspergillus positive cul-
ture from tracheal aspirates remains most difficult in patients
with intermediate risk [5], or in patients without currently rec-
ognized risk factors. The golden standard for the definite diag-
nosis of proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis remains
histopathological lung tissue examination. In clinical practice,
the diagnosis of proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is
rarely established ante-mortem, because of the critical condi-
tion of the patients, excluding invasive procedures. Since no
non-invasive diagnostic test is sensitive or specific enough to
establish definite diagnosis, the diagnostic categories of
'probable' and 'possible invasive pulmonary aspergillosis' have
been developed, based on the combination of host risk fac-
tors, clinical symptoms and distinct radiological and microbio-
logical criteria [11]. These diagnostic criteria were originally
developed for clinical trials in patients with bone marrow trans-
plants and cancer. However, in ICU patients, clinical signs and
symptoms are often non-specific, and except for neutropenia
and a congenital or acquired immunocompromised state, it is
not feasible to define particular host risk factors, or combina-
tions of risk factors, for the acquisition of invasive fungal dis-
ease, since there are no large epidemiological studies in this
special patient population.
The aim of the present study is to assess the clinical relevance
of Aspergillus positive respiratory tract samples in ICU
patients, based upon a diagnostic algorithm derived from the
European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of
Cancer/Mycosis Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria for inva-
sive fungal disease [11] with a modified interpretation of med-
ical imaging data and microbiological findings. The validity of
the diagnostic criteria was assessed if biopsy or necropsy
data were available.
Materials and methods
Setting
The present study was conducted in the Ghent University
Hospital, a 1,060 bed primary care and referral centre with a
54 bed ICU including a surgical and medical ICU, an ICU for
cardiac surgery and a unit for severely burned patients.
Approximately 3,800 patients are admitted to the ICU each
year. The surgical ICU serves all kinds of surgery with the need
for intensive care management, including multiple trauma and
solid organ transplantations. During the study period, 910
patients received a solid organ transplant (kidney, pancreas,
liver and heart).
The medical ICU serves all patients with internal diseases
requiring intensive care, including patients with haematologi-
cal malignancies and bone marrow transplant recipients; a
total of 270 haematological patients was admitted during the
study period. For immunocompromised patients or patients
colonized or infected with epidemiologically important micro-
organisms, each unit is equipped with several isolation rooms.
The burns unit consists of six separated isolation rooms with
shower and bath installations within.
Study design
The study is designed as a historical cohort study (retrospec-
tive analysis of prospectively gathered data), including all
patients admitted to the ICUs during the period January 1997
through December 2003. The sole criterion for entry in the
study is a lower respiratory tract culture positive for Aspergil-
lus spp. As a routine practice, all intubated patients in the ICU
receive surveillance cultures of endotracheal aspirate thrice
weekly. Otherwise, respiratory specimens from all patients,
including pulmonary biopsy and specimens of normally sterile
sites, are obtained according to the instructions of the attend-
ing physicians. The local Center for Hospital Hygiene and
Infection Control prospectively files all patient records with any
positive culture for Aspergillus spp., hence all relevant data
could be retrieved.
Patients admitted to the ICU with prior diagnosis of invasive
Aspergillus disease were not included in the analysis.
Data collection and processing, and patient anonymisation
were done according to legal regulations and local Ethics
Committee requirements. Given the non-interventional design,
the Ethics Committee of the Ghent University Hospital waived
informed consent.
Definitions of definite or probable invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis and Aspergillus colonisation
An adapted clinical algorithm considering clinical status, host
factors, microbiological data, bronchoscopy with broncho-
alveolar lavage, medical imaging and cytological examination
of smears of broncho-alveolar lavage fluid results was used to
discriminate colonisation from invasive infection. These criteria

for defining cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis are sum-
marized in Table 1. For the diagnosis of probable invasive pul-
monary aspergillosis, all criteria needed to be fulfilled (1 + 2 +
3 + either 4a or 4b). This algorithm is in part derived from the
EORTC/MSG consensus data concerning opportunistic inva-
sive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients with
cancer and hematopoetic stem cell transplants [11]. The cir-
culating galactomannan test for Aspergillus antigen was not
routinely available in our institution during the study period,
and was hence not taken into the diagnostic elaboration.
Patients not fullfilling the criteria for invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis were classified as colonized. Autopsy was per-
formed at the request of the attending physician after consent
of the family.
Data collection
The following data relevant to patient characteristics were col-
lected: age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation
(APACHE) II score [12], comorbidities and underlying dis-
eases, and treatment with systemic and inhalation corticoster-
oids. Data collected concerning ICU treatment and outcome
were ICU stay, ventilator dependence, need for vasopressor or
inotropic treatment, need for renal replacement therapy, and
antifungal therapy. Outcome was described as in-hospital
mortality, defined as death within the same hospital episode as
the ICU admission.
Classification of radiological findings
Results of chest X-ray and thoracic CT scan were described
as normal, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like,
non-specific infiltrates and consolidation, pleural fluid, nodular
lesion(s), halo sign, air-crescent sign, and cavitation. The CT
halo sign is described as a mass-like infiltrate with a surround-
ing halo of ground glass attenuation. The halo lesion was
shown to correspond to a central fungal nodule surrounded by

Results
During the observation period, 25,216 patients were admitted
to the ICU. Respiratory tract samples were positive for
Aspergillus in 172 patients (incidence: 6.8/1,000 ICU admis-
sions). The diagnostic breakdown of the cohort is illustrated in
Figure 1. According to the predefined criteria, 83 cases
(48.3%) were classified as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis
(17 definite, 68 probable). In the remaining 89 patients
(51.7%), the presence of Aspergillus was considered as col-
onisation. Pulmonary biopsy was performed in ten patients.
Biopsy was positive in seven patients, who were classified as
documented invasive aspergillosis ante-mortem. In three
patients, classified clinically as colonisation, lung biopsy
showed no fungal disease. Autopsy in patients with an
Aspergillus positive respiratory tract specimen was performed
in 16 patients. Ten of these patients fullfilled the predefined
criteria of probable invasive pulmonary aspergillus ante-mor-
tem; since lung necropsy specimens confirmed the diagnosis,
they were subsequently classified as definite invasive pulmo-
nary aspergillosis. In six patients who were considered as col-
onized ante-mortem, the autopsy did not reveal invasive
Aspergillus disease.
In Table 2, underlying conditions of patients with invasive pul-
monary aspergillosis and colonisation are summarized. Of the
patients diagnosed with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis,

40% of patients had a high risk profile (neutropenia, hemato-
logical cancer, bone marrow or stem cell transplant). Patient
characteristics and outcome are summarised in Table 3. Tho-
racic medical imaging (Table 4) shows that nodular lesions
were almost exclusively found in invasive pulmonary aspergil-
losis (30% versus 2%; P < 0.001). The halo and air-crescent
sign were evident in only three patients. Most patients classi-
fied as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis had non-specific radi-
ological findings.
Appropriate antifungal treatment was given to 71 (85.5%)
patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. All patients
classified with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in whom no
antifungal therapy was started died (n = 12). When these
patients were excluded, the mortality rate was 73%. Figure 2
shows the survival curves of patients categorised as invasive
aspergillosis and colonisation.
Discussion
Until recently, research on epidemiology and risk factors for
the acquisition of Aspergillus infection and treatment of inva-
sive disease has almost enterily focused on severely immuno-
compromised patients with hematological malignancy and
solid organ recipients. However, recent literature indicates an
expanding spectrum of patients at risk for invasive aspergillus
disease. These are categorised into high risk (allogeneic bone
marrow transplant, neutropenia and hematological cancer),
intermediate risk (autologous bone marrow transplant, malnu-
trition, corticosteroids, HIV, solid organ transplant, diabetes,
underlying pulmonary disease and solid organ cancer) and low
risk (cystic fibrosis and connective tissue disease) [5]. Further-
more, case reports and papers about invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis in COPD patients and apparently non-immuno-
compromized patients [19-26] have been published.
Hence, it seems worthwile to address the question of diagno-
sis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in ICU patients. The
lack of validated and stringent criteria for case definitions in
patient categories, other than hemato-oncological and solid
organ transplant, hampers diagnostic assessment. The ante-
mortem diagnosis of proven invasive aspergillosis is extremely
difficult to establish in ICU patients as hemodynamic and/or
respiratory insufficiency and coagulopathy often preclude
invasive tissue sampling. Because of these diagnostic limita-
tions, a feasible diagnostic approach was developed. As in the
EORTC/MSG definitions, host factors for the acquisition of
invasive disease were taken into account. For patients who did
not meet the criteria for high-risk host, the Aspergillus spp.
positive tracheal aspirate had to be corroborated with a posi-
tive semi-quantitative culture and a positive cytological exami-

nation of broncho-alveolar lavage fluid. This is in part endorsed
by the observations of Greub and Bille [27] in a case-definition
study in immunocompromised patients: compared to those
from patients considered to be colonised, cultures of lower
respiratory tract specimens from patients with proven invasive
pulmonary aspergillosis showed a significant difference in the
total number of Aspergillus colonies recovered from culture
per episode; for BAL (broncho-alveolar lavage), the number of
Aspergillus colonies per agar plate was also significantly
higher in the proven aspergillosis group. Furthermore, many
authors consider the visualisation of the characteristic septate
hyphae in bronchial washings as a confirmatory finding of inva-
sive disease in the presence of a compatible clinical picture
[8,28-32]. False-positive results appear to be unusual, since
patients without chronic lung diseases rarely show colonisa-
tion of the lower tracheobronchial tree with Aspergillus [33].
Compared to the EORTC/MSG diagnostic criteria, the inter-
pretation of radiological data in the algorithm is also less strict,
as any major radiological sign of pneumonia is taken into con-
sideration. Medical imaging of the thorax in ICU patients is less
pathognomonic due to many confounding factors such as ven-
tilator associated pneumonia, atelectasis, and pleural fluid
effusions in critically ill ventilated patients; furthermore, it can
be speculated that typical radiological lesions may be less
apparent because of the difference in severity and nature of
the immune derangements. Typical lesions for invasive
aspergillosis, such as the halo and the air-crescent sign, were
only found in 5% of patients. This is in agreement with the low
sensitivity of 24% in patients without hematological malig-
nancy compared with 82% in patients with neutropenic hema-
tological malignancy [34].
Since the modified clinical diagnosis of probable invasive
aspergillosis is less stringent than the EORTC/MSG criteria, a
lower specificity may be of concern. However, in a limited
number of patients, histopathological specimens were availa-
ble in order to check the validity of the clinical assumption.
Samples for histology were available in 26 patients. Of these,
13 fullfilled the EORTC/MSG criteria for host risk factors. Ten
patients underwent pulmonary biopsy. Seven of these met the
criteria of probable aspergillosis prior to biopsy, and could be
reclassified ante-mortem as definite invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis because of a positive histopathological examina-
tion. In three other patients, classified as colonized, lung
biopsy showed no evidence of fungal infection. Furthermore,
autopsy data were available in 16 patients, of whom 10 were
classified as probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis ante-
mortem, and the other six patients as colonized. Necropsy
findings histologically confirmed the clinical diagnosis in all
these patients. These data are in support of a high positive
predictive value of the criteria for the diagnosis of invasive pul-
monary aspergillosis. Nevertheless, the number of patients
with histological confirmation was low. The true predictive
value of the proposed diagnostic algorithm needs to be
assessed prospectively.
In this study, using an entry criterion of an Aspergillus positive
respiratory specimen and an adapted diagnostic algorithm, an
incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis of 3.2/1,000
ICU admissions was found. In the subgroup of medical
patients, the incidence was three times as high (10.2/1,000).
In a recent retrospective study in a medical ICU, an incidence
of invasive aspergillosis of even 5.8% was found, with, in most
cases, pulmonary involvement [6]. In a study considering
autopsies of patients from a mixed medical-surgical ICU, an
incidence of 2.7% of proven invasive aspergilosis was found
[7]. In general, the autopsy rate is low in our institution (<5%)
because of local ethical regulations. It can not be excluded
that patients classified as colonized indeed had invasive dis-
ease, and that other patients with negative surveillance cul-
tures suffered from invasive disease since respiratory tract
cultures lack sensitivity. It is clear that a stringent protocol for
post-mortem examination is necessary for a truthful estimation
of the epidemiology and incidence of invasive aspergillosis in

ICU patients [6,7]. Furthermore, prospective research should
include non-culture methods for diagnosis, such as the detec-
tion of galactomannan, PCR, and beta-D-glucan in non-neutro-
penic patients [35,36]. At this time, it is unclear if these non-
invasive methods are of any diagnostic value in critically ill
patients without the EORTC/MSG host risk factors.
An important finding is that the majority of the patients classi-
fied as having invasive pulmonary aspergillosis did not belong
to the well known high-risk group (neutropenia, bone marrow
transplant, hematological cancer); this is in accordance with
the data provided in the study by Meersseman and colleagues
[6]. Underlying conditions, such as COPD, chronic lung dis-
ease, non-hematological malignancy, HIV infection, diabetes
mellitus, liver failure, chronic alcohol abuse, malnutrition and
extensive burns, have been described in association with inva-
sive aspergillosis [5,7,37,38]. In the EORTC/MSG diagnostic
criteria, the use of corticosteroids for more than three weeks
is considered a predisposing host factor [11]. In the setting of
persistent septic shock, steroids are frequently used since a
beneficial effect has been demonstrated [39]. Corticosteroids
substantially impair macrophage killing of Aspergillus spores
and mononuclear cell killing of Aspergillus hyphae [40]. In the
setting of underlying lung disease, there is a risk factor for inva-
sive aspergillosis at much lower doses and shorter courses of
steroids [41,42]. This should be taken into account in the clin-
ical assessment of an Aspergillus spp. positive respiratory
tract sample. Steroid treatment has also been given important
weight in a recently described point-score system for assess-
ment of positive cultures [43]. It has been speculated that
patients with normal immune function prior to ICU admission
may be at risk for invasive aspergillosis due to a temporary
immunoparalysis in the context of the multiple organ dysfunc-
tion syndrome [44].
Hospital mortality of patients with invasive pulmonary aspergil-
losis in this study was high (77%), but in accordance with pre-
vious reports describing dramatic fatality rates [22,24,45,46].
When comparing the survival curves of the group of patients
with invasive aspergillosis with the group of patients classified
as colonised, a clear difference is observed during the first 15
days after positive respiratory Aspergillus culture and fullfill-
ment of the diagnostic criteria for invasive disease. The initial
decline of the curve of patients with invasive disease is more
pronounced, reflecting an acute mortality probably due to
Aspergillus infection. This fits well with the generally accepted
time frame of the development of invasive Aspergillus disease
until demise. This observation is an indirect argument in favour
of the value of the diagnostic algorithm.
Conclusion
The finding of an Aspergillus positive respiratory tract sample
in an ICU patient cannot be discarded and must trigger further
diagnostic exploration using BAL, with semiquantitative cul-
ture and cytological examination, as well as CT scan and pul-
monary biopsy if possible. Adapted clinical diagnostic criteria
should be used in order not to miss a critical window of thera-
peutic opportunity.
The proposed diagnostic algorithm for the diagnosis of inva-
sive pulmonary aspergillosis is supported by histopathological
data from a subgroup of patients. An important finding is that
not only patients with severe hematological disease are
afflicted: the majority of patients has an intermediate risk for
the acquisition of invasive disease. Radiological features are
often non-specific. The associated mortality is high in spite of
appropriate treatment.

nificance of Aspergillus species isolated from respiratory
Key messages
• The finding of Aspergillus spp. in respiratory tract sam-
ples in critically ill patients should not be routinely dis-
carded as colonisation, even in presumably
immunocompetent hosts.
• Clinical signs and symptoms of invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis and radiographic features are often non-
specific in ICU patients
• Risk factors for the development of invasive aspergillo-
sis in critically ill patients include neutropenia, haemato-
logical malignancy and immunosuppressive treatment.
However, invasive disease can occur in the absence of
these risk factors.
• In the presence of clinical features of unresolving pneu-
monia, appropriate antifungal therapy should be consid-
ered carefully when Aspergillus spp. is isolated from
respiratory tract specimens, in patients with COPD,
after corticosteroid exposure even in moderate dose,
and in other patients with severe underlying disease
and critical illness induced immunoparalysis.
