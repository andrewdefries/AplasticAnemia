Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of
cancer death in men and women in the United States and
has the lowest survival rate for any solid cancer. Over
42,000 individuals are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in
the United States each year and over 35,000 will die of the
disease [1]. Similar mortality figures are reported in
Europe, with 1- and 5-year survival rates of only 15% and
4%, respectively [2]. One important reason for this poor
survival is that about 85% of patients present with
advanced disease, limiting our ability to treat the disease at
an early, curable stage [3]. For this reason, there is
considerable interest in identifying the disease in its
earliest stages, such as by screening high-risk individuals
[4], identifying better diagnostic markers of early-stage
disease [5], identifying familial and genetic risk factors that
contribute to the disease [6], and ultimately develop­ing
risk prediction models to identify at-risk individuals [7].
Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include family
history, inheriting deleterious mutations in pancreatic
cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA2, p16, STK11, PALB2
and PRSS1), cigarette smoking, chronic pancreatitis,
long-standing diabetes, obesity, Helicobacter pylori
infection and occupational exposures [8]. However, these
factors do not fully account for the prevalence of
pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, it is unclear how some of
these risk factors mediate pancreatic cancer risk. An
association between non-O blood group and pancreatic
cancer was first identified in the 1960s, but it has been
underappreciated as a risk factor despite the fact that
other studies found similar associations with gastric and
other cancers [9-11]. Recently, several studies have
reported a significant association between the ABO
blood group and pancreatic cancer risk [12-15].
ABO blood group and pancreatic cancer
The Panscan consortium (which consists of the Pan­
creatic Cancer Cohort Consortia and the Pancreatic
Cancer Case-Control Consortia (Panc4)) performed a
genome-wide association study (GWAS) with approxi­
mately 550,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
comparing 1,896 individuals with pancreatic cancer and
1,939 controls ascertained from 12 cohort studies and the
Mayo clinic case-control study (PanScanI) [14]. The SNP
variants that provided the strongest evidence of
association were then validated in an independent set of
2,457 cases and 2,654 controls from eight case-control
studies. In this work, several common variants at the
ABO blood group locus showed significant evidence of
association with pancreatic cancer in the combined data
[14]. Among individuals of European ancestry, the SNP
rs505992, located within the first intron of the ABO gene,
was strongly associated with pancreatic cancer
(multiplicative per-allele odds ratio (OR) 1.20, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 1.28, P = 5.37 × 10-8
). This
SNP is in complete linkage disequili­brium with, and is
thereby perfectly correlated with, the O/non-O blood
group variant.
The ABO system was first described by Karl Land­
steiner in 1900, and the ABO gene was cloned in 1990
[16]. The ABO gene encodes glycosyltransferase enzymes
that transfer specific sugar residues to the H antigen.
There are three variant alleles (A, B and O), which encode
Abstract
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading
cause of cancer death in the United States. Recent
reports, including genome-wide association studies
and self-reported blood serotype studies, have
shown that individuals of European ancestry who
carry non-O blood group are at an increased risk of
developing pancreatic cancer. Two recent genome-
wide association studies of pancreatic cancer have
identified associations between pancreatic cancer risk
and genetic variants in the ABO blood group gene, the
locus containing the telomerase reverse transcriptase
(hTERT) gene, the nuclear receptor family gene NR5A2
and a non-genic region on chromosome 13q22.1.

three different glycosyltransferases. The A allele encodes
the enzyme α1R3 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase,
which attaches N-acetylgalactosamine to the H antigen to
form the A antigen. The B allele encodes α1R3 galacto­syl­
transferase, which attaches d-galactose, and the O allele
encodes a non-functional glycosyltransferase and thus
the H antigen remains unmodified.
The association between ABO genotypes and pan­
creatic cancer reported by PanScan [14] was supported
by Wolpin et al. [12], who identified an association
between ABO serotypes and pancreatic cancer risk. They
used two large prospective cohort studies (the Nurses’
Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study)
with 107,503 participants [12]. Cox proportional hazards
model, adjusted for age, tobacco use, body mass index,
physical activity and history of diabetes mellitus, was
used to calculate hazard ratios for pancreatic cancer by
ABO blood type. Compared with individuals of O
serotype, individuals with blood group A, AB or B had a
significantly increased rate of pancreatic cancer (Table 1).
To examine this association further, Wolpin et al. [12]
then used the SNP data generated from the 12 cohort
studies included in full PanScan GWAS to derive ABO
genotypes (OO, AO, AA, AB, BO and BB) and ABO sero­
types (A, B, AB and O) and then examined the association
of these two measures with pancreatic cancer risk [13].
Patients with pancreatic cancer were compared with
controls without pancreatic cancer and matched for year
of birth, gender, race/ethnicity and source of DNA, and
four of the cohorts were matched for smoking status and
baseline age. This analysis further supported their earlier
findings: compared with individuals of blood group O,
the odds of developing pancreatic cancer were signifi­
cantly higher for individuals with blood group A, AB or
B. The analyses also provided important information on
the influence of genotype: individuals with AA, BB or AB
genotype were at higher risk of pancreatic cancer than
individuals with AO or BO genotype (Table  2). The
authors estimated that inheritance of non-O blood group
accounted for 19.5% of all pancreatic cancer in indivi­
duals of European ancestry.
The mechanism(s) by which ABO status influences
pancreatic cancer risk remains unclear. ABO antigens
are found not only on the surface of red blood cells but
also on the surface of epithelial cells of the gastro­
intestinal, bronchopulmonary and urogenital tracts [17].
ABO blood group is associated with differences in several
circulating inflammatory, infectious and vascular media­
tors, and therefore chronic inflammation has been
suggested as a potential mechanism for the association
between ABO blood group and cancer risk. On the other
hand, loss of expression of ABO blood group has been
described in some pancreatic cancers and a systemic
mechanism by which ABO blood groups predispose to
pancreatic cancer would not be expected to require loss
of expression of ABO in pancreatic cancers [9,18]. Also, if
an inflammatory modifier role of ABO is causal in cancer
development, then ABO should be important in the
develop­ment of numerous inflammation-mediated cancers,
such as esophageal or gall-bladder cancer or colitis-asso­
ciated colorectal cancer, but no such association has been
found yet [19]. The association between ABO and a
limited number of cancers and evidence for loss of
expres­sion during tumor develop­ment implicate a tumor
suppressor role for blood groups A and B in cancer
development. Further studies to better elucidate the
mechanism by which ABO mediates cancer susceptibility
are needed to fully understand this association.
Other genomic associations with pancreatic cancer
Recently, the PanScan consortium conducted a second
GWAS (PanScanII) in which they genotyped approxi­
mately 620,000 SNPs in an additional 1,955 cases and
1,955 controls [15] from the same eight case-control
studies used for replication of top loci in the original
GWAS [14]. SNPs from the two studies were combined,
resulting in data on approximately 550,000 SNPs from
3,851 individuals with pancreatic cancer and 3,934
controls. Analysis of these combined regions identified

three new genomic regions on chromosomes 13q22.1,
1q32.1 and 5p15.33 associated with an increased risk of
pancreatic cancer. The locus on 13q22.1 was associated
with SNP rs9543325, in a non-genic region between the
transcription factor genes KLF5 and KLF12, which
regulate cell growth and transformation. Five SNPs were
closely associated with the nuclear receptor family gene
NR5A2 on 1q32.1, whose product is known to interact
with β-catenin. The strongest SNP was rs3790844
(P = 2.45 × 10−10
, per-allele OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.84).
A third locus marked by rs401681 (P = 3.66 × 10−7
, per-
allele OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.27) was identified on
chromosome 5p15.33, within intron 13 of CLPTM1L and
close to the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene, hTERT.
Although not much is known yet about the potential
role of NR5A2, KLF5 and KLF12 in pancreatic cancer
susceptibility, the hTERT-CLPTM1L locus has been
previously implicated as a cancer susceptibility gene
[20‑24]. Another SNP in this locus, rs4635969, ranked
12th most significant in the PanScan GWAS, with
P = 1.05 × 10-6
, just short of genome-wide significance.
Although CLPTM1L is upregulated in cisplatin-resistant
cell lines and may have a role in apoptosis, because of the
importance of telomeres in cancer susceptibility it is
suspected that these variants are more likely to be
important for their influence on hTERT and telomere
length and function rather than on CLPTM1L.
hTERT is expressed in approximately 90% of human
cancers and is essential for maintaining telomere ends.
Germline mutations in hTERT can cause acute myeloid
leukemia and aplastic anemia, and rare variants in hTERT
cause inherited bone marrow failure [25-27]. Telomere
length has a strong inherited component [28]. Telomeres
are made up of DNA repeat sequences (TTAGGG) and
telomere binding proteins [29] that prevent fusion
between ends of chromosomes. Telomeric fusions occur
at critically shortened telomeres and lead to ring and
dicentric chromosomes that form anaphase bridges.
Breakage of anaphase bridges generates highly recom­bi­
no­genic free DNA ends, fusion of broken ends and
chromosomal rearrangements that can be self-perpetu­
ating and are typical of many cancers [30]. Telomere
shortening will cause senescence unless pathways such as
p53 are overcome [31], and neoplastic clones later
express hTERT and telomerase for cellular immortali­
zation [32-38]. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas have very
short telomeres [35], complex karyotypes, numerous
chromosomal abnormalities and high fractional allelic
losses [36,37]. The T allele of rs401681 is associated with
increased risk of pancreatic cancer and melanoma [23],
but the C allele is associated with an increased risk of
lung, prostate, basal cell and bladder cancers [20-23].
Initial attempts to find a correlation between the hTERT
variant rs401681 with telomere length were inconclusive,
perhaps because other factors such as age, sex, smoking
and exercise influence telomere length [38-40].
Implications for research and therapy
One challenge with GWAS discoveries has been deter­
mining how these findings could benefit clinical practice.
Generally, GWAS discoveries have provided important
clues to disease mechanisms that will hopefully even­
tually have an impact on clinical management of disease.
The small magnitude of risk estimates attributable to an
individual disease-associated SNP have not generally
been large enough to provide immediate clinical benefits
in areas such as risk prediction [41,42]. Studies are now
underway to determine whether pancreatic cancer
GWAS alleles influence pancreatic cancer prognosis and
response to therapy.
In summary, the results of the first pancreatic cancer
GWASs have added to our knowledge of genetic loci
associated with pancreatic cancer. The PanScan GWAS
was a robust study that included a large number of cases
and controls, many of whom were originally enrolled in
large, well-designed prospective studies. At the same
time, these first GWASs [15,16] were powered to detect
alleles with relatively large effects, and alleles with
moderate to small effect on pancreatic cancer risk may
have been overlooked. Further studies are now needed to
investigate the mechanisms by which the association
between ABO blood group antigens and variants in other
loci, such as the hTERT locus, contribute to pancreatic
cancer susceptibility. Given the early success of the first
pancreatic cancer GWAS, larger association studies are
likely to provide additional insights into pancreatic
cancer susceptibility. GWASs are very useful for identify­
ing common low-penetrance alleles that contribute to
disease susceptibility [43-45], and diseases that have gone
through several rounds of GWASs and post-GWAS
validation continue to yield important new findings and
to refine the significance of earlier findings [46].
Understanding the genetic and biological mechanisms of
pancreatic cancer will eventually improve our ability to
diagnose and treat this deadly disease.
