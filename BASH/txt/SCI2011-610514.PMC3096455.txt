Use of umbilical unrelated cord-blood (UCB) cells as an alternative source of hematopoietic cell transplantation has been widely
used mainly for patients lacking an HLA-matched donor. UCB present many advantages over bone marrow or mobilized peripheral
blood from volunteer donors, such as rapid availability, absence of risk for the donor, and decreased incidence of acute graft-
versus-host disease. However, a signiﬁcant clinical problem is delayed engraftment that is directly correlated with the number
of hematopoietic stem cells in a cord-blood unit. The identiﬁcation of prognostic factors associated with engraftment that can
be easily modiﬁed (e.g., strategies for donor choice) and the development of new approaches including use of multiple donors,
intrabone injection of UCB, ex vivo expansion, and cotransplantation with accessory cells are of crucial importance in order
to circumvent the problem of delayed engraftment after UCB transplantation. Those approaches may increase the quality and
availability of UCB for transplantation.
1. Introduction
UCB transplantation has extended the availability of
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to
patients who would otherwise not be eligible for this curative
approach. In comparison with other sources of allogeneic
HCT, UCB oﬀers substantial advantages [1], including
(i) signiﬁcantly faster availability of banked cryopreserved
UCB units, with patients receiving UCB transplantation in
a median of 25–36 days earlier than those receiving an
unrelated bone marrow graft, (ii) extension of the donor
pool due to tolerance of 1-2 HLA mismatches out of 6,
(iii) lower incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host
disease (GvHD), (iv) lower risk of transmitting infections by
latent viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-
Barr virus (EBV), (v) lack of risk to the donor, and (vi) higher
frequency of rare haplotypes compared to bone marrow
registries, since it is easier to target ethnic minorities.
However, the main problem with using UCB for
transplantation is the relatively low number of hematopoietic
progenitor cells (HPC) and HSC in UCB compared with
bone marrow or mobilised peripheral blood (MPB) grafts
which translates into increased risk of graft failure, delayed
hematopoietic engraftment [2–6], and delayed immune
reconstitution [7, 8]. The cumulative incidence of non-
engraftment after UCB transplantation varies from 10 to
20% and the median time to neutrophil recovery varies from
22 to 27 days. Many approaches have been investigated to
enhance collection of HSC and HPC in cord blood units.
Examples include injecting cord blood cells directly into the
bone marrow [9], in vivo or ex vivo ampliﬁcation of cord
blood cells [10, 11], use of double unit UCB transplanta-
tion [12, 13], use of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC)
regimen [13–15], and coinfusion with a haploidentical T cell
depleted graft [16, 17] or mesenchymal stem cells [18].
Many prognostic studies for improving engraftment after
UCB transplantation have been performed, analyzing factors
related to patients, disease, donor, and transplantation [5,
19–25]. Modiﬁable factors have been identiﬁed, such as HLA,
cell dose, and others related to the graft choice or factors
related to conditioning regimen [26] or GVHD prophylaxis
[27].

This paper will focus on risk factors aﬀecting engraft-
ment after UCB transplantation and on procedures aiming
to guide clinicians to avoid graft failure following UCB
transplantation.
2. Risk Factors for Engraftment
2.1. Impact of Cell Dose, HLA, and Diagnosis. Almost all
series concerning UCB transplantation in children and adults
have demonstrated the profound impact of cell dose, mea-
sured as prefreezing or infused total nucleated cells (TNC),
colony-forming cells, and CD34+ cells on engraftment,
transplant-related events, and survival [28]. HLA matching
was also recognized as an important factor for engraftment.
In 1997, Eurocord group has described for the ﬁrst time
the association of TNC dose and HLA with neutrophils
and platelets recovery and survival, in 143 patients, mostly
children, given a related and unrelated cord-blood transplan-
tation [19]. In fact the median TNC dose infused (3.7 ×
107
/kg) was the best cutoﬀ value that was associated with
higher probability of neutrophils and platelets recovery and
improved survival rate. Furthermore, a better HLA matching
(deﬁned as matched or mismatched based on HLA-A and -B
low-resolution and HLA-DRB1 high-resolution typing) was
also associated with better engraftment and survival, but due
to small number of patients, the number of HLA disparities
associated with outcomes was not studied. Later on, those
results have been conﬁrmed in a series of 562 children and
adults who received unrelated cord-blood cell grafts [20]:
higher cell dose and number of HLA disparities (6/6, 5/6,
or 4/6, considering the same above HLA deﬁnition) were
independent factors associated with better engraftment and
decreased transplantation-related mortality. According to the
aforementioned studies, it was clear that HLA matching and
cell dose were crucial factors for improving outcomes after
UCB transplantation, and probably the number of TNC
collected or infused should not be inferior to 2.5 × 107
/kg or
2.0 × 107
/kg (considering a loss of TNC around 20%). Also,
the number of HLA disparities should be higher or equal to
4 out of 6 (following the above deﬁnition).
2.2. Transplantation-Related Factors: Conditioning Regimen
and GVHD Prophylaxis. Factors related to the technique of
transplantation, such as conditioning regimen and GVHD
prophylaxis may also be associated with more rapid engraft-
ment.
In a recent Eurocord study, the use of Fludarabine in
myeloablative conditioning regimens was associated with
improved neutrophil and platelet recovery in adult UCB
transplantation recipients receiving a lower TNC dose [26].
Use of ﬂudarabine in the preparative regimen has also been
associated with improved engraftment independently of cell
dose and HLA in UCB transplantation for patients with
Fanconi anemia [29]. Conversely, the use of methotrexate
(MTX) containing regimens for GVHD prophylaxis has
been associated with delayed engraftment and increased
risk of graft failure in patients with hemoglobinopathies
transplanted with an HLA identical sibling cord-blood unit
[27]. However, its use in elsewhere in UCB transplan-
tation has not been evaluated. In Europe and the USA,
the most common regimen is calcineurin inhibitor-based
GVHD prophylaxis alone or in combination with steroids
or mycophenolate mofetil. Nevertheless, Japanese transplant
centers have shown interesting results with calcineurin
inhibitors in combination with low-dose MTX [30, 31].
Prospective studies are needed to establish the role of MTX
in GVHD prophylaxis in the setting of UCB transplanta-
tion.
3. Approaches to Improve Engraftment and
Decrease Early Transplantation Mortality
3.1. Selection of Cord Blood Units Based on the Interactions
between Cell Dose, HLA Disparities, and Diagnosis. Cell
dose and HLA disparities are important and independent
factors that interact mutually on engraftment following UCB
transplantation.
Eurocord group has tried to analyze the interaction of
cell dose and HLA in 550 UCB transplantation recipients,
adults and children, with malignant disorders [23]. We
have found that 60 day cumulative incidence (CI) of
neutrophils engraftment for all patients was 74%, whereas
the incidences for those with no HLA disparity (6/6) versus
1 or more out of 6 HLA disparities were 83% and 53%,
respectively. The number of HLA disparities was correlated
with neutrophils recovery with a log-linear relationship
between HLA disparity and risk of graft failure, suggesting
inferior engraftment with increased disparity. Cumulative
incidence (CI) of neutrophil and platelet recovery was also
associated with the number of TNC before freezing and the
use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.
Eapen et al. have also tried to analyze the interaction
between cell dose and HLA, comparing outcomes of 503
UCB transplantations and 282 unrelated bone marrow
transplants (UBMTs) in children with acute leukemia [6].
A cut-oﬀ for collected cell dose was deﬁned as 3.0 ×
107
/kg for survival in children given a 5/6 HLA disparity
graft, but a cell dose cutoﬀ associated with survival of
children given a 6/6 or 4/6 grafts were not found. The
probability of neutrophils recovery by day 42 and platelets
by 6 months were similar after UBMT or matched UCB
transplantation (6/6). However, higher cell doses (> 3.0 ×
107
/kg) resulted in a higher probability of engraftment in
5/6 UCB transplantation but had no eﬀect in 4/6 UCB
transplantation, probably suggesting that cell dose may not
be able to overcome the adverse impact of HLA mismatching
in the setting of 4/6 UCBT.
Recently, Barker et al. [32] analyzed the combined
impact of prefreeze TNC dose and HLA match upon CBT
outcome in recipients of 0 to 3 HLA-A, -B antigen, and -
DRB1 allele-mismatched CB units. A thousand and sixty-
one patients were studied, having received a single-unit CBT
for the treatment of acute leukaemia or myelodysplasia, after
myeloablative conditioning. The study demonstrated that
the best outcome for neutrophil and platelet engraftment,
acute GVHD, transplant-related mortality (TRM), treatment
Stem Cells International 3
failure, and overall mortality was associated with the trans-
plantation of 6/6 HLA-matched units, regardless of the TNC
dose. The next best survival outcomes were observed in
recipients of 5/6 HLA match with a TNC dose of 2.5×107
/kg
or greater or 4/6 HLA match units with a TNC dose of
5.0 × 107
/kg or greater [32].
In both previous analyses, the interaction between cell
dose and HLA were studied in patients with malignant
disorders. However, other factors such as diagnosis have
an important role in rate of engraftment and other out-
comes. This is due to the fact that most patients with
hemoglobinopathies have a full marrow and have not
received chemotherapy or immunosuppression before con-
ditioning, or, in the cases of aplastic anemia, they have often
received previous multiple transfusions or had a severe infec-
tion at the time of transplantation, thus increasing the risk
of nonengraftment. Recently, in the light of the observation
that requirements regarding cell dose and HLA matching
may diﬀer in malignant and nonmalignant diseases [1], we
attempted to construct an algorithm to guide clinicians in
choosing the “best” cord-blood unit, taking into account the
impact of diagnosis, cell dose, and HLA incompatibilities,
in patients receiving a single UCB transplantation. If the
cell dose with a single unit is not achieved, a double
cord blood transplant should be investigated. With this
objective, two diﬀerent cohorts of patients who had received
a single UCB transplantation between 1994 and 2005 were
analyzed: 925 patients had a malignant disease and 279 had a
nonmalignant disease (Eurocord; unpublished data). Donor-
recipient histocompatibility was determined by serology or
antigen typing (low resolution) for HLA-A and HLA-B and
by allele typing for HLA-DRB1. In the malignant disease
group, we found that cell dose was the most important
factor inﬂuencing outcome; a minimum cell dose of 3 × 107
TNC/kg at collection and of 2 × 107
TNC/kg at infusion
needed to be targeted. We also showed that the number of
HLA mismatches increased the risk of delayed engraftment
and led to a higher incidence of transplant-related mortality
(TRM) and chronic GvHD; however, it decreased the risk
of relapse, resulting overall in a lack of inﬂuence of HLA
mismatching on overall survival (OS) and disease free
survival (DFS). Type of HLA mismatch did not inﬂuence
outcome, but matching for HLA-DRB1 appeared better for
patients receiving a graft that had two HLA incompatibilities.
As stated earlier, increasing cell dose abrogated the eﬀect
of HLA mismatching, but not for grafts with 3 or 4 HLA
incompatibilities.
Thus, patients with a nonmalignant disease should
receive a higher cell dose to obtain engraftment than
patients with a malignant disease; this should not be below
4.9 × 107
TNC/kg at collection and 3.5 × 107
TNC/kg
at infusion. In nonmalignant disorders, HLA mismatching
played a major role in engraftment, GvHD, TRM, and
survival, which was partially abrogated by increasing cell
dose. A UCB graft containing two or more HLA disparities
with a cell dose inferior to 3.5 × 107
TNC/kg should be
avoided. Experience of double cord blood transplantation in
nonmalignant disorders is still too limited to allow routine
recommendation of this type of transplant [33].
3.2. Double UCB Transplantation. Because cell dose is con-
sidered to be a critical determinant of outcomes in UCB
transplantation, the Minneapolis group has demonstrated
that transplantation of two partially HLA-matched cord
units may overcome the problem of cell dose and make
the transplantation of heavier adult patients feasible. This
strategy has led to an increased number of adult patients
receiving UCB transplantation. Results with double cord-
blood transplantation support the safety of the procedure
[12, 13]. Chimerism data from these studies reveal that
typically only one cord-blood engrafts. In spite of the fact
that double cord-blood transplant recipients are heavier than
patients receiving a single unit, cumulative incidence of
neutrophil recovery does not diﬀer statistically between the
two groups. This observation suggests a “booster” eﬀect from
the nonengrafting unit.
3.2.1. Outcomes after Double UCBT Compared with Single
UCBT in Adults with Acute Leukemia. Recent data from the
Minnesota group suggests that double UCBT is associated
with a higher incidence of acute GVHD compared to that
of single UCBT but without an increase in nonrelapse
mortality. Interestingly, in an analysis of 177 patients with
acute leukemia, relapse was signiﬁcantly lower for early stage
(CR1-2) patients who received two UCB units, suggesting a
greater GVL eﬀect. DFS was 40% and 51% for single and
double unit recipients, respectively (P = .35) [34].
The Eurocord group has published results of single and
double UCBT for patients with lymphoid malignancies [35].
Relapse incidence was reduced for patients transplanted with
a dUCBT compared to those patients transplanted with
a single unit. Recently, in a preliminary and unpublished
analysis, Eurocord in collaboration with the Acute Leukemia
Working party of EBMT have compared the outcomes after
dUCBT (n = 213) with single UCBT (sUCBT = 378) in
adult patients with acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia
in remission. There were some diﬀerences between the
two groups: double UCBT recipients were heavier (median
weight: 69 kg versus 64 kg, P < .01), tended to be older
(median age was 39 years versus 36 years, P = .09),
transplanted more recently (P < .01), and more frequently
given RIC (55% versus 32%, P < .001) and less ATG/ALG
(38% versus 61%, P < .001) compared to sUCBT recipients,
respectively. As expected, double UCBT recipients received
a graft containing a higher nucleated cell dose (median
of 3.7 × 107
/kg versus 2.6 × 107
/kg; P < .0001) and
greater number of HLA disparities (4/6: 72% versus 62%,
P = .03) when compared to single UCB grafts. There
were no diﬀerences in the type of leukemia (AML or ALL)
or disease status at transplant (53% were in ﬁrst CR and
47% in CR2 or more). There were no statistical diﬀerences
in CI of neutrophil recovery (86 ± 3% in double UCBT
versus 87 ± 2% in single UCBT, P = .62); however, CI
of acute GVHD (II–IV) was higher after double UCBT
(36 ± 3% versus 25 ± 2%, P = .004) compared with single
UCBT, but chronic GVHD was not statistically diﬀerent
between the two groups. Two-year CI of NRM was 37 ±
4% after double UCBT, and it was 36 ± 3% after single
4 Stem Cells International
UCBT (P = .62), whereas relapse incidence was reduced after
double UCBT (18 ± 3% versus 26 ± 3% after single UCBT)
(P = .05). DFS at 2 years after double UCBT was 45 ± 3%,
and after single UCBT, it was 38 ± 3% (P = .05). In a
multivariate analysis adjusted for the diﬀerences outlined
above, double UCBT was associated with an increased risk
of acute GVHD (II–IV) and decreased incidence of relapse.
DFS was not statistically diﬀerent between double UCBT and
single UCBT recipients; however, we observed an improved
DFS rate in patients transplanted in ﬁrst CR with double
UCBT.
This Eurocord preliminary analysis conﬁrms the previ-
ous ﬁndings of more GVHD, equivalent NRM, and reduced
relapse in adult recipients of double UCBT, mainly for those
transplanted in early disease status, showing a higher GVL
eﬀect. No impact has yet been observed on DFS, perhaps due
to relatively short followup at this stage.
3.2.2. Comparison of Double Unrelated Cord-Blood Trans-
plantation with HLA-Matched Sibling and HLA-Matched and
Mismatched Unrelated Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplan-
tation. Recently, C. Brunstein, on behalf of the University
of Minnesota and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center, published an analysis of 536 patients with malignant
disease (AML, n = 211; ALL, n = 236; CML, n =
70, MDS, n = 19) transplanted with an HLA 8/8 allele
matched related (MRD, n = 204) or unrelated donor (MUD,
n = 152), 1 allele mismatched unrelated donors (MMUD,
n = 52) or double UCB (n = 128) [36]. All patients
received myeloablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide
and TBI with ﬂudarabine administered prior to double
UCBT and received GVHD immunosuppression with a
calcineurin inhibitor and either methotrexate (MRD, MUD,
and MMUD) or mycophenolate mofetil (MRD and double
UCBT). While patients’ weight and sex distribution and
proportion with standard risk disease were similar, double
UCBT patients were younger (median age 25 years, MRD
40 years, MUD 31 years, MMUD 31 years; P < .01). The
proportion of AML and ALL was similar among groups
although more CML patients received a MUD or MMUD.
The median followup of survivors was 3.1 years (range:
0.3–8.1 years). When transplant outcomes were compared,
double UCBT was associated with slower hematopoietic
recovery compared to other stem cell sources, with median
times to neutrophil and platelet recovery being at least 1
week and 4 weeks longer after double UCBT, respectively.
Furthermore, despite greater HLA mismatch, the cumulative
incidence of grade II–IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD
were lowest after double UCBT. Despite a reduced risk
of GVHD after double UCBT, the risk of relapse was
remarkably, low while TRM was elevated, resulting in
similar progression-free survival (PFS). In the absence of
a MRD donor, using either MUD or double UCB yield
encouraging PFS and are promising donor options. These
results support the use of HLA 0–2 antigen mismatched
double UCBT in patients with hematological malignancies
as front line therapy in patients lacking a matched sibling
donor.
3.3. Reduced Intensity Conditioning Regimen Prior to Single
or Double UCB Transplantation from Unrelated Donors in
Adults. Most studies have tested UCB transplantation in
the setting of myeloablative conditioning. RIC before UCB
transplantation has been increasingly used in order to
decrease toxicity, shorten the duration of aplasia and extend
the availability of cord-blood transplantation to the elderly
or patients who are not eligible for myeloablative condition-
ing. The Minnesota group has evaluated the eﬃcacy of UCB
in the setting of a nonmyeloablative regimen consisting of
ﬂudarabine, cyclophosphamide and a single fraction of total
body irradiation (200 cGy) with cyclosporine and mycophe-
nolate mofetil for posttransplantation immunoprophylaxis.
The target cell dose for the UCB graft was 3.0 × 107
TNC/kg, resulting in the selection of a second partially HLA-
matched UCB unit in 85% of patients [13]. One hundred ten
patients with hematologic diseases were enrolled. Neutrophil
recovery was achieved in 92% at a median of 12 days. One
cord blood unit predominated engraftment and none of the
following factors were predictive of which unit eventually
dominated: total nucleated CD34+ and CD3+ cell doses,
HLA matching, nucleated cell viability, ABO typing, gender
match, or order of unit infusion. Transplantation-related
mortality was 26% at 3 years. Survival and event-free survival
(EFS) at 3 years were 45% and 38%, respectively.
More recently, the Soci´et´e Franc¸aise de Greﬀe de Moelle-
Th´erapie Cellulaire (SFGM-TC) in collaboration with Euro-
cord reported results of 155 consecutive UCB transplan-
tations performed using a RIC regimen with a median
followup of 18 months (range 2–56) [37]. Conditioning
regimen was as previously described and GVHD prophy-
laxis consisted in cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil.
Cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment at day +60
was 80 ± 3% with a median time to achieve neutrophils
>0.5/L of 20 days; autologous recovery was seen in 14% of
the patients. In multivariate analysis, factors independently
associated with better neutrophil recovery were CD34 cell
dose (> 1.2 × 105
/kg) (HR 1.51, P = .04), HLA compatibility
(0-1 versus 2-3) (HR 1.5, P = .05), and previous autograft
(HR 1.8, P < .01). Cumulative incidence of nonrelapse
mortality (NRM) was 18 ± 3% at 18 months. The estimated
probability of OS and DFS at 18 months was 62 ± 5% and
51 ± 4%, respectively.
In summary, both studies demonstrated the feasibility of
RIC-UCB transplantation and reported encouraging results
with this approach. In spite of reducing the duration of apla-
sia, cumulative incidence of engraftment remains between
80% to 90%. Once again HLA disparity and cell dose played
an important role and myeloid engraftment was achieved in
94% when patients received a well HLA-matched (6/6 or 5/6)
cord blood unit(s) with a higher CD34 cell dose [37].
3.4. Use of Accessory Cells to Improve Engraftment
3.4.1. Cotransplantation of a UCB Unit with Highly Puriﬁed
CD34+ Cells from Haploidentical Family Donors. Phase I-
II clinical trials using accessory population(s) to enhance
engraftment have been published, with interesting results.
Stem Cells International 5
The Spanish group developed a strategy of UCB transplan-
tation with coinfusion of a limited number of highly puriﬁed
mobilized HSC (MHSC) from a HLA unrestricted third
party donor (TPD). Short posttransplant periods of neu-
tropenia were generally observed in adults with haematolog-
ical disorders receiving UCB transplantation with relatively
low cell content and 0–3 HLA mismatches after myeloab-
lative conditioning. This shortened neutropenic phase was
due to an early and initially predominant engraftment of the
TPD-MHSC. After a variable period of double complete TPD
+ UCB chimerism, ﬁnal full UCB chimerism was achieved
(cumulative incidence >90%) within 100 days. Early recovery
of the circulating neutrophils resulting from the “bridge
transplant” of the TPD-MHSC reduced the incidence of
serious neutropenia-related infections, also facilitating the
use of drugs with myelosuppressive side eﬀects to combat
other infections. The observed incidence of GVHD and
relapses was low, with overall and disease-free survival curves
comparable to those of HLA identical sibling transplants
[17, 38, 39].
3.4.2. Cotransplantation of an UCB Unit with Haploidentical
Parenteral Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells [18, 40].
MacMillan et al. [18] have reported an attempt to speed
hematopoietic recovery in a single-institution phase I-II
clinical trial in which ex vivo culture-expanded multipotent
mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from haploidentical
parental donors were infused at the time of UCB transplanta-
tion. Fifteen pediatric patients with high-risk acute leukemia
were enrolled. Eight patients received MSCs on day 0, with
three patients having a second dose infused on day 21. No
serious adverse events were observed with any MSC infusion.
All eight patients achieved neutrophil engraftment at a
median of 19 days. Probability of platelet engraftment was
75%, at a median of 53 days. With a median followup of 6.8
years, ﬁve patients remain alive and disease free. In another
pilot study [40], ex vivo culture-expanded bone marrow
MSC from parental donors were infused at the time of the
transplantation or the in case of refractory acute GvHD. Nine
patients received MSC immediately after CB transplantation
and TPD highly puriﬁed mobilized HSC. Neither immediate
adverse eﬀects nor signiﬁcant diﬀerences in CB engraftment
or acute GvHD development were observed. Four patients
developed grade II acute GvHD and two steroid-refractory.
The last two achieved complete remission after therapeutic
infusions of MSC.
The results of both pilot studies show that infusion of ex
vivo culture-expanded haploidentical MSCs into unrelated
UCB transplantation recipients can be performed safely.
Further studies may investigate the role of coinfusion of MSC
in order to improve engraftment after UCB transplantation.
3.5. Other Experimental Approaches
3.5.1. Enhancing Collection Homing and Expansion of UCB
Cells. Because of the limiting numbers of HSCs and HPCs
in banked cord blood, the means to (1) enhance collection
of cord blood cells [41], (2) enhance the homing and
engraftment of HSCs/HPCs [42, 43], and/or (3) enhance
the ex vivo or in vivo expansion of these cells could greatly
enhance the quality and usefulness of cord-blood cells for
transplantation.
It is possible to substantially enhance the numbers
of HPC collected by perfusing the placental vessels after
draining the blood from the cord [41], but the practicality of
this method for banking remains to be evaluated. If perfusion
of the placenta after collection of blood from the cord is
untaken, it would need to be done in selected collection
centers with well-trained personnel.
There have been a number of eﬀorts to enhance the
homing and engraftment capability of HSCs and HPCs.
One such means is to inhibit the enzymatic activity of
CD26/Dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV) with small pep-
tides [42, 43]. CD26/DPPIV truncates and inactivates the
chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12)
that binds a receptor, CXCR4. The SDF-1/CXCL12-CXCR4
axis is known to be important in the in vitro chemotaxis
and in vivo homing of mouse and human HSCs. Not only
is the truncated SDF-1/CXCL12 inactive but also blocks the
actions of the full-length active form of SDF-1/CXCL12. This
ﬁnding suggested that a means to enhance SDF-1/CXCL12
activity by preventing its truncation by CD26/DPPIV might
enhance the homing and engraftment of HSCs and HPCs.
Using small peptide inhibitors of CD26/DPPIV such as
Diprotin A or Val-Pyr, it was possible to enhance the homing
and engrafting capability of mouse bone marrow HSCs
into lethally irradiated mice, and human cord blood HSCs
into sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice [43]. Other
mechanisms are under investigation with the aim to improve
ex vivo expansion of cord blood cells. Phase I/II clinical trials
have started to evaluate safety and toxicity of infusing Notch-
ligand Delta 1 or copper chelator tetraethylenepentamine
(TEPA; StemEx) to induce ex vivo expansion of cord blood
progenitors in patients with hematologic malignancies [10,
11]. Interestingly, Notch-ligand Delta 1 has also been shown
to have an eﬀect on early T-cell expansion and diﬀerentiation
[44]. Recently, Delaney et al. have described a Notch-
mediated ex vivo expansion system for human CD34+ cord
blood progenitors that results in a marked increase in the
absolute number of stem/progenitor cells, including those
capable of enhance repopulation in the marrow NOD-SCID
mice [45]. Moreover, a phase I trial is ongoing, involving
transplantation of a nonmanipulated unit along with cord
blood progenitors expanded ex vivo in the presence of Notch
ligand. Ten patients have been enrolled, who underwent
double UCBT after myeloablative conditioning for high-risk
acute leukemia. Signiﬁcantly, more rapid myeloid engraft-
ment was observed, with median time to neutrophil recovery
(neutrophils 500/µL) being 16 days, faster than would be
expected using 2 nonmanipulated units (median time 23 to
26 days or longer in the published literature) [45].
Future eﬀorts to expand HSC/HPC ex vivo and in
vivo and to enhance the homing and engrafting capa-
bilities of cord blood cells will likely make use of more
in depth information on intracellular signaling molecules
and their networks involved in HSC and HPC functions,
including self-renewal, proliferative, survival, diﬀerentiation,
6 Stem Cells International
and migration. Further information on the bone marrow
microenvironment and how HSC/HPC interact with this
microenvironment will permit the development of more
eﬀective ways to achieve engraftment.
3.5.2. Enhancing Homing Capacity with Direct Intrabone Mar-
row Injection of Cord-Blood Cells. The concept of enhancing
homing capacity of cord-blood cells through their direct
injection into the bone-marrow environment has led some
investigators to apply this approach clinically. In mice, it has
been suggested that intrabone infusion of CD34+ cord-blood
cells confers an engraftment advantage 15 times greater
than after intravenous infusion, because cell loss during
circulation before homing is circumvented [46]. Recently, a
phase I/II study [9] was performed to establish the safety
and eﬃcacy of the intrabone administration of cord blood
cells, measured by the donor-derived neutrophil and platelet
engraftment. Thirty two patients presented leukaemia, 14
with advanced disease. HLA-matching was 5/6, 4/6, and 3/6
for 9, 22, and one patient, respectively. Most of the patients
received a myeloablative conditioning regimen associated
with ATG and only 2 patients received a RIC prior to
UCB transplantation. Cord-blood cells were concentrated
in four 5-mL syringes and were infused in the superior-
posterior iliac crest under rapid general anaesthesia. Median
transplanted cell dose was 2.6 × 107
/kg. No complications
occurred during or after the intrabone infusion of cells.
Median time to recovery of neutrophils was 23 days (range
14–44) and median time to recovery of platelets was 36 days
(range 16–64). All patients were fully chimeric from 30 days
after transplantation to the last followup visit, suggesting
early complete donor engraftment. No patient developed
grade III-IV acute GVHD. More recently, in a preliminary
matched pair analysis comparing patients transplanted with
cord blood injected intravenously (IVCB) versus cord blood
injected directed into the bone marrow (IBCB) of the iliac
crest, IBCB patients (n = 50) were matched with 88 IVCB
recipients. Cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil recovery
was 70 ± 5% in IVCB recipients versus 80 ± 6% in the
IBCB group (P = .27). However, patients receiving IBCB
had a higher CI of platelet recovery at day 60 (82 ± 5%)
compared to the IVCB group (40±5%; P < .0001). Strikingly,
the incidence of acute GVHD grade II–IV was 12% in the
IBCB group compared to 38% in the IVCB group (P =
.0001), and the incidence of grade III-IV GVHD was 2%
compared to 18%, (P < .001) respectively. Overall survival
at one year was 67 ± 7% compared to 43 ± 5% (P = .07),
respectively. In summary, injection of cord-blood cells into
the bone marrow appears to signiﬁcantly reduce the problem
of delayed platelet recovery observed after IVCB. The reduced
incidence and severity of acute GVHD observed in IBCB
patients is intriguing and promising [9].
4. Conclusions
Engraftment after UCB transplantation is improving in
the recent years, mainly due to better donor choice (cell
dose and HLA matching), improvement in supportive care,
greater centre experience. Other approaches that improve
engraftment after UCB transplantation are being currently
developed with very encouraging results. Those approaches
may greatly increase the clinical use of cord-blood cells for
transplantation.
