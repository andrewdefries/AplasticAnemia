INTRODUCTION
Androgens have a wide variety of biological effects, includ-
ing several actions in hematopoiesis (1). The administration
of testosterone was shown to increase hemoglobin levels in
mice (2), and experiments with plethoric mice suggested that
its major erythropoietic effect was exerted through the stimu-
lation of erythropoietin (EPO) production by the kidney (3).
This mechanism is unlikely to be involved in the beneficial
effects of androgens in aplastic anemia patients, who produce
abundant EPO; moreover, androgens have been shown to exert
actions on hematopoietic cells independent of their effect on
EPO secretion. In addition to increased hemoglobin levels,
mice injected with testosterone derivatives had increased granu-
locyte and platelet numbers (4, 5). In vitro, androgens stimulated
hematopoiesis in marrow suspension cultures (6-8) and enhanced
both erythroid and myeloid colony formation in semisolid
cultures (9, 10). It was demonstrated that testosterone was
taken up by the nuclei of rat bone marrow cells and that it
stimulated total RNA metabolism (11). Androgens have also
been implicated in increasing the production of colony-stim-
ulating factors by adherent cells from normal human blood
(12). In addition, androgens have diverse, generally suppres-
sive effects on the immune system (13, 14), which might be
involved in their therapeutic effects in aplastic anemia.
In most of the previous studies regarding the in vitro effects
of androgens on hematopoietic cells, whole bone marrow cells
were used, rather than purified hematopoietic progenitor cells
such as CD34+ cells. Furthermore, the question of whether
androgens affect the survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells
has not been well studied. In addition, the effects of androgens
on the production of hematopoietic growth factors by bone
marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), which might affect the growth
and survival of hematopoietic progenitors, are poorly under-
stood. With these questions in mind, we investigated the
effects of androgens, such as testosteone, 5 -dihydrotestos-
terone (5-DHT), and oxymetholone, on the survival of puri-
fied normal hematopoietic progenitor cells and on the pro-
duction of cytokines by normal BMSCs. Here, we show that
direct survival-enhancing or growth-stimulatory effects of
androgens on hematopoietic progenitor cells were minimal
and mostly restricted to mature erythroid progenitors. Oxy-
metholone and 5-DHT stimulated the production of several
cytokines in bone marrow stromal cells, and oxymetholone-

Direct and Indirect Effects of Androgens on Survival of Hematopoietic
Progenitor Cells In Vitro
Androgens remain a common treatment for certain type of anemia, based upon its
myelostimulating effects; however, it has not been established whether androgens
affect apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). We investigated the effects
of the androgens, such as testosterone, 5 -dihydrotestosterone (5-DHT), and oxy-
metholone, on apoptosis of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. Androgens
did not rescue normal bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells and colony-forming cells
(CFCs), other than mature erythroid CFCs, from apoptosis induced by serum- and
growth factor deprivation. Oxymetholone did not affect growth factor-mediated sur-
vival of normal CD34+ cells or its inhibition by interferon-gamma (IFN- ). In a stan-
dard methylcellulose clonogenic assay, low concentrations of oxymetholone and
5-DHT stimulated the clonal growth of colony-forming unit (CFU)-erythroid, but did
not affect growth of CFU-granulocyte/macrophage or burst-forming unit-erythroid.
Oxymetholone and 5-DHT stimulated the production of stem cell factor in normal
bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) via transcriptional regulation. In agreement
with this, oxymetholone-treated BMSCs better supported the survival of HPCs. These
data indicate that survival-enhancing or growth-stimulatory effects of androgens on
hematopoietic progenitor cells are minimal and mostly restricted to mature erythroid
progenitors, and its myelostimulating effects could be attributed, at least in part, to
the stimulation of production of hematopoietic growth factors in BMSCs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and cell lines
CD34+ cells were purified from bone marrow obtained
from normal donors undergoing bone marrow harvest, after
informed consent. Following Ficoll separation, CD34+ cells
were isolated using the MACS system (Miltenyi Biotec, Au-
burn, CA, U.S.A.) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Only cell preparations with purity of 95% CD34+ or
greater by flow cytometric analysis were used in the experi-
ments. Primary human BMSCs were prepared by culturing
CD34-negative cells (the cells that remained after purifica-
tion of the CD34+ cells from the bone marrow mononuclear
cells) in MEM- (Gibco BRL Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY, U.S.A.) supplemented with 12.5% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 12.5% horse serum (Gibco), 10-6
M hydrocortisone
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.), 5×10-5
M 2-mercaptoethanol
(Sigma), streptomycin, and penicillin (hereafter referred to
as LTC medium). After confluence was reached, the adherent
cells were harvested and maintained in LTC medium with
weekly passage. After three passages, neither CD45+ cells nor
PECAM-1+ cells were detected by flow cytometric analysis.
The murine bone marrow stromal cell line MS-5 was grown
in MEM- supplemented with 10% FBS and was passaged
weekly.
Hormones and cytokines
Testosterone, 5 -dihydrotestosterone (5-DHT), and 2-
estadiol were purchased from Sigma. Oxymetholone was kindly
provided by Hanseo Pharmaceutical Co. (Seoul, Korea). The
hormones were formulated as 1×10-2
M stock solutions using
ethanol as diluent and stored at -20℃. The following cyto-
kines were used: interleukin-3 (IL-3), stem cell factor (SCF),
flk-2 ligand (FL), thrombopoietin (TPO), EPO, and stromal
cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1 ) (all purchased from R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, U.S.A.).
Flow cytometry
A total of 5×104
to 1×105
cells were incubated at 4℃
for 30 min with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD34
monoclonal antibody (HPAC-2; Becton-Dickinson, San Jose,
CA, U.S.A.) and were analyzed using a Coulter Elite flow
cytometer (Coulter Electronics Ltd., Hialeah, FL, U.S.A.).
Isotope-identical antibodies served as controls. To detect apop-
tosis, cells were stained with FITC-conjugated annexin V (BD
PharMingen, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.) alone or together with
propidium iodide (PI; BD PharMingen) according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Clonogenic assay in methylcellulose
Cells (1×103
CD34+ cells or the equivalent) were plated
in triplicate in 35-mm tissue culture dishes containing 1 mL
of assay medium consisting of Iscove’s modified Dulbecco
medium (IMDM; Gibco), 1.2% methylcellulose (Stem Cells,
Vancouver, Canada), 30% FBS, 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol, 2
mM L-glutamine (Gibco), and 0.5 mM hemin (Sigma), sup-
plemented with 20 ng/mL SCF, 50 ng/mL IL-3, and 6 U/mL
EPO. After 7-14 days of incubation at 37℃ in 5% CO2 in
air, the numbers of colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macro-
phage (CFU-GM), burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E),
and colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) were scored under
the inverted microscpoe.
Preparation of conditioned media (CM)
Conditioned media were prepared from MS-5 cells and pri-
mary human BMSCs grown in the appropriate medium in
T25 culture flasks. When confluence was reached, the cultures
were thoroughly rinsed, and 3 mL of serum-free X-VIVO
medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MA, U.S.A.) was added
to each flask, with or without the inclusion of androgens. After
a 72-hr incubation at 37℃, the supernatants were harvested,
filtered through 2-micron membranes, and stored at 4℃
until analyzed.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
The concentrations of SDF-1 and SCF in the conditioned
media were measured using commercial ELISA kits (R&D
Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
optical density was measured using a spectrophotometer (Mo-
lecular Device Co., Sunnyvale, CA, U.S.A.). The standard
curves and calculated levels of the cytokines were obtained
using the program SoftmaxTM
(Molecular Device Co.).

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Total RNA was prepared from primary human BMSCs
using TrizolTM
(Gibco) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. After purification, 1 g of RNA was reverse-transcribed
using SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Gibco) and the uni-
versal primer oligo dT15 (Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.).
One L of the cDNA products was then added to 24 L of
PCR buffer (Gibco) supplemented with 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2
M specific primers (Table 1), and 1 U/reaction tube of Koma
Taq polymerase (Koma International, Seoul, Korea). The PCR
cycles consisted of 1 min at 94℃, 45 sec at 55-65℃, and 1
min at 72℃; 30 cycles were carried out using a GeneAmp
PCR system (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT, U.S.A.).
Northern blot analysis
The expression of SDF-1 mRNA in primary human BMSCs
was detected by Northern hybridization. Briefly, 20 g of
total RNA was loaded in each lane, separated on 1.2% agarose
gels containing 2.4% formaldehyde, and then transferred
onto nylon membranes (Schleicher & Shuell, Keene, NH,
U.S.A.) for 24 hr by the capillary transfer method. All probes
were radiolabeled using a random priming protocol (Amer-
sham Life Science, Arlington Heights, IL, U.S.A.). The mem-
branes were hybridized with random primer-labeled SDF-1
probefor24hr,washed,andthensubjectedtoautoradiography.
Western blot analysis
Western blotting was used to detect the expression of SDF-1
protein in primary human BMSCs. Cells were pelleted, washed
in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed by the addition of
SDS sample buffer composed of 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8),
6% (w/v) SDS, 30% glycerol, 125 mM DTT, and 0.03%
(w/v) bromophenol blue. Total cell samples were sonicated,
lysed, and denatured by boiling for 5 min. Equal amounts
of protein from each sample were electrophoresed on 15%
SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (Amersham). The membranes were blocked for
1 hr with TBS containing 5% (w/v) milk and 0.1% Tween,
and then incubated with the primary mouse monoclonal anti-
body (12G5; R&D Systems) overnight at 4℃. The blots were
washed with TBST buffer, incubated with anti-mouse sec-
ondary antibody (Amersham) for 2 hr, and developed using
West-ZolTM
Plus (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea).
Statistical analysis
The results are expressed as the mean±standard deviation
(SD) of experiments conducted in triplicate or greater repli-
cates. Data were analyzed using Student’s t-test for paired or
non-paired samples. A p value of less than 0.05 was consid-
ered significant.
RESULTS
Androgens stimulates clonal growth of CFU-E, but not
BFU-E or CFU-GM
We examined the effect of the addition of 1×10-7
to 1×10-5
M oxymetholone or other hormones to normal BM CD34+
cells in a standard methylcellulose assay supplemented with
the hematopoietic growth factors SCF, IL-3, and EPO. Oxy-
metholone did not influence the numbers of CFU-GM or
BFU-E; however, there was a slight increase in the number
of CFU-E in the presence of 1×10-7
or 1×10-6
M, but not
1×10-5
M, oxymetholone compared with controls grown
without added hormones. The addition of testosterone, 5-
DHT, or -estradiol also induced an increased number of
CFU-E, but did not affect the number of CFU-GM or BFU-
E in this assay (Table 2).

tions. After a 72-hr incubation, the concentrations of SDF-1 in the culture
supernatants were measured using an ELISA. The presented data are

Testosteone and 5-DHT at a high concentration, but not
oxymetholone, enhance apoptosis of normal BM CD34+
cells induced by growth factor deprivation
Normal BM CD34+ cells were incubated for 36 hr in serum-
and hematopoietic growth factor (HGF)-free IMDM, with
and without androgens at a concentration of 10-5
M. After
the cells were stained with propidium iodide and annexin
V, the level of apoptosis was analyzed using flow cytometry.
The percentage of annexin-positive apoptotic cells was not
changed by the addition of oxymetholone (51.5±5.1%) com-
pared with controls (52.6±5.6%). Similar results were obta-
ined at lower concentrations of oxymetholone (10-9
to 10-6
M;
data not shown). Again unexpectedly, both testosterone and
5-DHT at this concentration significantly increased the per-
centage of annexin-positive cells (62.2±5.9%, p<0.05; 61.7
±6.4%, p<0.05, respectively) (Fig. 1A). The addition of
either SDF1 or SCF in combination with 5-DHT partially
relieved the increase in apoptosis induced by 5-DHT, and
the addition of both SDF-1 and SCF completely reversed it
(Fig. 1B).
Oxymetholone does not affect cytokine-mediated alteration
of survival of normal BM CD34+ cells
To further define the role of androgens in the survival of
hematopoietic progenitor cells, we examined the time course
of apoptosis. Normal BM CD34+ cells were incubated for 7
days in IMDM in the absence or presence of a combination
of low concentrations of growth factors (5 ng/mL TPO+5
ng/mL FL+5 ng/mL SCF, hereafter referred to as TFS). This
combination of growth factors was expected to enhance the
survival, rather than the proliferation, of CD34+ cells. In the
absence of all cytokines, annexin-positive cells markedly in-
creased over time; the addition of oxymetholone did not delay
the development of apoptosis. In the presence of TFS, the
percentage of annexin-positive cells was much lower at every
time point compared with that of cells incubated in the ab-
sence of TFS, regardless of CD34 positivity. Again, the addi-
tion of oxymetholone in combination with TFS did not result
in any changes in the level of apoptosis (Table 4).
We next examined whether oxymetholone affects IFN- -
mediated alterations in the clonal growth and survival of
hematopoietic progenitor cells. In a standard methylcellulose
clonogenic assay containing SCF, IL-3, and EPO, the addi-
tion of INF- caused a significant decrease in the numbers
of both CFU-GM and BFU-E; the inclusion of 10-9
to 10-5
M oxymetholone had no effect on this INF- -induced inhi-
bition of clonal growth (data not shown). Normal BM CD34+
cells were incubated for 7 days in IMDM in the absence or
presence of TFS. The addition of IFN- in combination with
TFS significantly decreased the percentage of annexin-nega-
tive CD34+ cells in a dose-dependent manner, while increas-
ing the percentage of annexin-negative/CD34-negative cells
and annexin-positive cells. Again, the inclusion of oxymetho-
lone did not alter the effects of IFN- on the survival of CD34+
cells (Table 4).
5-DHT, but not testosterone or oxymetholone, down-reg-
ulates SDF-1 production in bone marrow stromal cells
The possibility that androgens might be involved in the
regulation of SDF-1 production in BMSCs was explored. Con-
ditioned medium collected after a 72-hr incubation with
untreated MS-5 cells contained a high concentration of SDF-
1 (64.3±6.4 ng/mL). The addition of 5-DHT at the begin-
ning of the culture period diminished the concentration of

a 72-hr incubation, the expression of SDF-1 was analyzed in total

the cells was analyzed by Northern hybridization. A blot of 28S ribo-
somal RNA is shown to control for RNA loading.

Western blot analysis was performed, using primary human
BMSC lysates. Treatment of the BMSCs with 5-DHT defi-
nitely decreased the amount of SDF-1 in a dose-dependent
manner, indicating that this hormone down-regulates the
production of SDF-1 in the cells (Fig. 2A). Northern blot
analysis revealed that the expression of SDF-1 mRNA in the
BMSCs was also down-regulated by 5-DHT (Fig. 2B).
Androgens modulate the production of HGFs in BMSCs
The possibility that androgens might influence the produc-
tion of HGFs in BMSCs was also investigated. Primary human
BMSCs were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 hr with
or without androgens, and the expression levels of the mRNAs
for various HGFs were analyzed by RT-PCR. Oxymetholone
and 5-DHT induced increased expression of the mRNAs of
IL-7, SCF, and TPO; decreased expression of IL-6 mRNA;
and no change in the expression of FL mRNA (Fig. 3). We
also used ELISA assays to examine the levels of SCF in the
conditioned media collected after a 72-hr incubation with
primary human BMSCs in the presence or absence of the hor-
mones. The addition of 5-DHT and oxymetholone at the
beginning of the culture period increased the concentration
of SCF in the conditioned medium in a dose-dependent man-
ner, whereas the addition of testosterone or -estradiol did
not (Table 6).
BMSCs treated with oxymetholone better support the
survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells
Normal BM CD34+ cells were incubated for 36 hr in con-
ditioned media harvested from primary human BMSCs incu-
bated in the presence or absence of 10-5
M oxymetholone.
There was a lower percentage of annexin-positive apoptotic
cells in the culture incubated in conditioned medium from
oxymetholone-treated BMSCs than in the culture incubated
in conditioned medium from untreated BMSCs (Table 7).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we showed that androgens, including
oxymetholone, have a modest growth- and survival-enhanc-
ing effect on CFU-E, but not on CFU-GM or BFU-E. These
effects, which were restricted to mature erythroid progenitors,
might be the basis for the observed androgen dependency
among responders to androgen therapy for aplastic anemia
(15). From the combined findings, it is clear that androgens
do not exert their myelostimulatory effects at the level of
hematopoietic stem cells or immature progenitor cells. It was
quite unexpected that testosterone and 5-DHT at a high con-
centration enhanced to some extent the apoptosis of normal
BM CD34+ cells induced by serum deprivation and growth
factor deprivation, rather than decreased it. These results differ
from observations in previous studies that found testosterone
and its derivatives enhanced the survival of hematopoietic
progenitor cells (8). This disparity could be attributable to
the type of cells analyzed in the experiments. In the previous
studies, bone marrow cells were used without purification
and thus were a mixed population of hematopoietic progen-
itor cells and various accessory cells present in the BM. It is
possible that the observations in the previous studies were
the result of the modulation of survival by accessory cells, such
as BMSCs, rather than the direct action of the hormones on
the hematopoietic progenitor cells. To our knowledge, this
is the first time that enhancement of apoptosis of normal BM
CD34+ cells by testosterone and 5-DHT has been reported.
This finding is less surprising than it initially might appear,
because androgens have been shown to induce apoptosis and

reached, the cultures were thoroughly rinsed, and 3 mL of serum-free
X-VIVO medium was added to each flask, with or without the inclusion
of hormones (10-5

growth inhibition of non-lymphocytic leukemic cells (16, 17).
IFN- is well known as a hematopoiesis-inhibitory cytokine
(18-20) and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of bone
marrow failure (21, 22). In the present study, oxymetholone
did not rescue colony-forming cells from IFN- induced
inhibition of clonal growth of BM CD34+ cells in methyl-
cellulose cultures. Furthermore, oxymetholone did not mit-
igate IFN- -induced suppression of growth factor-mediated
survival of CD34+ cells. These results suggest that direct
action of oxymetholone on hematopoietic progenitor cells is
minimal, raising the possibility that the myelostimulatory
effects of oxymetholone are attributable to other mechanisms.
Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), which is constitu-
tively produced in BMSCs, plays a central role in bone mar-
row homing of hematopoietic stem cells by signaling via its
receptor, CXCR4 (23). Recently, it has also been demonstrated
that SDF-1 is involved in the positive regulation of hemato-
poiesis. SDF-1 enhances both the survival and proliferation
of hematopoietic progenitors, especially in synergy with other
hematopoietic growth factors (24-26), while inhibiting the
cycling of very primitive hematopoietic cells, both in vitro
and in vivo (27). Therefore, it is possible that the down-regu-
lation of SDF-1 production in BMSCs would lead to the sup-
pression of hematopoietic cell survival and growth. In the
present study, we showed that 5-DHT, but not testosterone or
oxymetholone, down-regulated SDF-1 production in BMSCs
and that 5DHT-induced increases in apoptosis were nearly
completely relieved by the addition of SCF and SDF-1. This
paradoxical interaction between androgens and SDF-1 might
be part of a regulatory mechanism for in vivo homeostasis of
hematopoiesis. Androgens are known to suppress B lympho-
cyte development (28), and it has been demonstrated that this
suppression is mediated through the up-regulation of the
production of tumor growth factor-beta in BMSCs (29). In
this context, it is possible that the down-regulation of SDF-
1 production in BMSCs by 5-DHT contributes to the sup-
pression of B lymphocyte development, because SDF-1 also
plays a role in the development of B lymphocytes (30).
Androgen receptor is ubiquitously expressed in the bone
marrow cells of both males and females, with the exception
of lymphoid and erythroid cells (31). Testosterone derivatives
down-regulated IL-6 production in BMSCs in vitro (32), which
was consistent with the observation that orchiectomy increased
bone marrow IL-6 levels in mice (33). However, little was
known concerning whether testosterone or its derivatives
are involved in regulating the production of hematopoietic
growth factors. In the present study, we clearly showed that
androgens modulate the mRNA expression of several hema-
topoietic growth factors in BMSCs. Oxymetholone up-reg-
ulated the production of SCF via transcriptional regulation,
and conditioned medium derived from oxymetholone-treat-
ed BMSCs better supported the survival of BM CD34+ cells.
These results could provide an explanation for the observed
oxymetholone-mediated enhancement of granulopoiesis and
thrombopoiesis, as well as erythropoiesis, in vivo.
In summary, androgens including oxymetholone directly
stimulated the clonal growth and survival of mature erythroid
progenitor cells, but not that of immature erythroid progeni-
tors or granulocytic progenitors. Oxymetholone increased the
capacity of BMSCs to support hematopoietic progenitor cells,
most likely by up-regulating the production of a couple of
hematopoietic growth factors, including SCF.
