Abstract
Background: Immunohistochemical studies of lymphatic vessels have been limited by a lack of
specific markers. Recently, the novel D2-40 antibody, which selectively marks endothelium of
lymphatic vessels, was released. The aim of our study is to compare lymphatic and blood vessel
invasion detected by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) versus that detected by immunohistochemistry,
relating them with morphologic and molecular prognostic factors.
Methods: We selected 123 cases of invasive mammary carcinomas stratified into three subgroups
according to axillary lymph node status: macrometastases, micrometastases, and lymph node
negative. Lymphatic (LVI) and blood (BVI) vessel invasion were evaluated by H&E and
immunohistochemistry using the D2-40 and CD31 antibodies, and related to histologic tumor type
and grade, estrogen and progesterone receptors, E-cadherin, Ki67, p53, and Her2/neu expression.
Results: LVI was detected in H&E-stained sections in 17/123 cases (13.8%), and in D2-40 sections
in 35/123 cases (28.5%) (Kappa = 0.433). BVI was detected in H&E-stained sections in 5/123 cases
(4.1%), and in CD31 stained sections in 19/123 cases (15.4%) (Kappa = 0.198). LVI is positively
related to higher histologic grade (p = 0.013), higher Ki67 expression (p = 0.00013), and to the
presence of macrometastases (p = 0.002), and inversely related to estrogen (p = 0.0016) and
progesterone (p = 0.00017) receptors expression.
Conclusion: D2-40 is a reliable marker of lymphatic vessels and is a useful tool for lymphatic
emboli identification in immunostained sections of breast carcinomas with higher identification
rates than H&E. Lymphatic vessel invasion was related to other features (high combined histologic
grade, high Ki67 score, negative hormone receptors expression) associated with worse prognosis,
probable reflecting a potential for lymphatic metastatic spread and aggressive behavior.

Background
Lymphatic vessels are considered the main route by which
tumor cells reach axillary lymph nodes [1-3]. Lymphatic
vessel invasion (LVI) is known as an independent predic-
tor of lymph node metastases in breast cancer. The diag-
nosis of LVI is made based on the presence of tumor
emboli within vascular channels lined by a single layer of
endothelial cells without red blood cells. Lymphatic ves-
sels are flattened channels or open spaces lined by a single
layer of endothelial cells whose lumen are sometimes
filled with lymphocytes. However, the identification of
LVI is difficult in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
slides. Retraction artifacts that isolate tumor aggregates
due to tissue shrinkage during fixation are sometimes con-
fused with the true tumor emboli in lymphatic vessels
[4,5].
Several markers of endothelial cells have been used,
including CD31, CD34, and factor VIII-related antigen.
However, studies of lymphatic vessels have been limited
by lack of specific lymphatic endothelial markers and
immunohistochemical identification of lymphatic vessels
has been unreliable [1,6]. Novel selective markers for lym-
phatic endothelium have been released, such as LYVE-1,
Prox-1, desmoplakin, and podoplanin [7-12]. More
recently, the monoclonal antibody D2-40 was shown to
selectively detect lymphatic vessels in breast and tonsillar
tissue [13,14]. D2-40 is an IgG2a monoclonal antibody
that was generated against an oncofetal antigen M2A,
which is normally expressed in the fetal testis and reex-
pressed in germ cell neoplasia [15]. It is a novel mono-
clonal antibody to an Mr 40000 O-linked
sialoglycoprotein that reacts with a fixation-resistant
epitope on the lymphatic endothelium [16] The D2-40
antibody has been shown to specifically recognize podo-
planin, a glomerular podocyte membrane protein [17,18]
and has been shown to be a very sensitive and specific
marker for lymphatic endothelium in most tissues [19]
and especially in breast cancer [20]. D2-40 stains the
endothelium of lymphatic vessels, lymphangiomas,
Kaposi's sarcoma and Dabska tumor, but does not stain
endothelium of blood vessels, hemangiomas, glomus
tumors, angiolipomas, pyogenic granulomas, and vascu-
lar malformations [13,14,21,22].
The aim of our study is to compare lymphatic vessel inva-
sion (LVI) and blood vessel invasion (BVI) in invasive
mammary carcinomas using H&E and immunohisto-
chemical stained sections, relating them to other prognos-
tic factors.
Methods
We selected 123 patients with invasive mammary carcino-
mas (IMC), who had been submitted to surgical treatment
with axillary lymph node dissection at our hospital
between 1990 and 2004. The research was approved by
the Ethics Committee of the University. On original his-
topathologic examination, 41 cases were diagnosed as
axillary lymph node negative, 41 cases with micrometas-
tases (defined as neoplastic cell clusters measuring
between 0.2 and 2 mm), and 41 cases with macrometas-
tases (defined as neoplastic cell clusters larger than 2 mm)
[23]. No case of isolated tumor cells was included in this
study. The mean age of patients, the histologic type and
tumor grade of cases of each subgroup were similar. For
all cases, the original H&E-stained sections of primary
tumors and axillary lymph nodes were available for histo-
logic review. The paraffin blocks were available for addi-
tional sections and immunohistochemical analysis.
Special care was taken to include only specimens with suf-
ficient amount of normal tissue surrounding the invasive
tumor to evaluate peritumoral LVI and BVI.
Cases were evaluated with regard to age of patients and
tumor size using the TNM system [23]. Histologic analysis
of primary breast carcinoma features included histologic
type, histologic grade, LVI and BVI. The histologic type of
primary tumor was classified based on Page et al [24], and
the College of American Pathologists recommendations
[25], using rigid criteria for classification of special types.
Tumor grade was determined using the Nottingham grad-
ing system [26]. The diameter of the microscopic field
used for mitotic count was 0.44 mm. Primary tumors were
analyzed without acknowledgment of the lymph node
status.
H&E-stained sections of primary tumors were reviewed
and new histologic consecutive, serial sections were pre-
pared for immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohisto-
chemistry (IHC) was performed on 5 μm thickness
sections, using monoclonal antibodies (Table 1) and the
streptavidin-biotin peroxidase method. Heat-induced
epitope retrieval was done with citrate buffer pH6.0 for 25
minutes. Immunohistochemical reactions were devel-
oped with diaminobenzidine and sections counterstained
with Harrris hematoxylin. All immunostains were manu-
ally processed.
IHC using monoclonal anti-cytokeratin antibody (clone
AE1/AE3, Dako, USA) was carried out on sections of axil-
lary lymph nodes classified as negative to confirm this sta-
tus. Cytokeratin reactions were scored as negative or
positive. All axillary lymph nodes initially classified as
negative continued negative after IHC staining (Table 1).
The IHC-stained sections of all primary tumors and axil-
lary lymph nodes were evaluated without knowledge of
previous node status. All positive lymph nodes, doubts,
and 10% of negative nodes were re-evaluated by two
pathologists (VFZM and HG) using a double-headed

microscope. LVI and/or BVI were assessed by the same
pathologists reviewing the H&E and immunohistochemi-
cal stained sections. In H&E-stained sections, LVI and/or
BVI were considered evident if at least one tumor cell clus-
ter was clearly visible in the vascular space. In this study,
we defined LVI in H&E-stained sections, as tumor cell
nests in spaces and around the clump of tumor cell nests
that were lined by flattened endothelium with no sup-
porting smooth muscle or elastica, and/or were filled with
lymphatic fluid. Tumor cell nests in spaces that were
either not lined by endothelial cells or were lined by
endothelial-like cells, probably tumor-stromal fibrob-
lasts, were classified as stroma-invasive tumor cell nests.
Similarly, we defined BVI in H&E-stained sections, as
tumor cell nests in spaces and around the clump of tumor
cell nests that were lined by endothelium, that is, not flat-
tened, and/or were filled with red blood cells [16]. The
whole section was examined. In order to score lymphatic
invasion, only peritumoral areas, and peritumoral lym-
phatic invasion were counted as lymphatic invasion.
Intratumoral lymphatic invasion was not counted in this
study. In most cases, intratumoral lymphatic invasion can
be misinterpreted as retraction artifact and it was not the
purpose of our study to evaluate artifacts.
For this analysis, we evaluated LVI in adjacent stromal tis-
sue (peritumoral area) with a ×200 magnification, with
sequential assessment by two investigators, as recom-
mended by the First International Consensus on the
Methodology of Lymphangiogenesis Quantification in
Solid Human Tumors [27]. We have not used double
immunostaining for D2-40 and Ki67 monoclonal anti-
body for the purpose of counting the number of prolifer-
ating lymphatic endothelial cells [27]. Vessels were
considered as lymphatic when the endothelium stained
with both D2-40 and CD31 antibodies. Vessels were clas-
sified as blood vessels when the endothelium stained only
for the CD31 monoclonal antibody and was negative for
D2-40 in consecutive sections. Vessels that were D2-40
and CD31 positive and had red blood cells in the lumen
were considered lymphatic vessels. The red blood cells
could be present in lymphatic-blood vessel capillary
shunting or bleeding into lymphatic vessels. Also, vessels
that were D2-40 positive but were negative for CD31 anti-
body were considered lymphatic vessels (Figure 1).
Estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor expression
were determined by a method for scoring immunostain-
ing signal, according to Allred et al [28,29]. A proportion
score (PS) is assigned representing the estimated propor-
tion of tumor cells staining considering all positive cells
(range 0–5). Score 0 refers to no cells having been stained;
score 1, 1% of tumor cells stained; score 2, 10% of cells
stained; score 3, 1/3 of cells stained; score 4, 2/3 of cells
stained; and score 5, 100% of cells stained. An intensity
score (IS) is assigned representing the estimated average
staining intensity of positive tumor cells (range 0–3). A
total score (TS) is calculated from the sum of PS and IS
(ranging from 0, 2–8) [28]. A positive result for both ER
and PR is defined as TS ≥ 3, which was validated in clinical
studies [28,29]. Ki67 was evaluated by the percentage of
neoplastic cells showing nuclear staining in the most pro-
liferative area ("hot spot"). Tumors were grouped in four
categories: <10%, 10–25%, 25–50% and >50% [30].
Cases were classified as p53 positive when more than 10%
of neoplastic cells exhibited positive nuclear staining [25].
The Her2/neu stained sections were classified according to
Dako-HercepTest™ scoring system [31]. E-cadherin (E-
cad) reactivity was analyzed using a semiquantitative scor-
ing system and only the citoplasmic membrane staining
was considered. The reactivity was graded as "0" if there
was no evidence of staining, "1+" if 1–25% of cells
stained, "2+" if 26–49% stained, "3+" if 50–74% stained,
and "4+" if >75% of cells stained [32].
Statistical analysis was performed using the Epi-info
6.04b, SPSS 8.0 and WinStat software. We calculated
McNemars sign test and Cohen's Kappa for concordance
regarding vessel invasion evaluated with different meth-
ods and the correlation coefficients between variables
according to Pearson or Spearman. Comparisons among
the three groups were done by one-way analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) or Kruskall-Wallis test. The relationship

between LVI and BVI and tumor characteristics was evalu-
ated with the help of a logistic regression analysis [33,34].
Results
The age of patients ranged from 27 to 88 years (mean =
55.9 years, median = 52 years). Clinicopathologic features
of the tumors are summarized in Table 2.
Immunohistochemical features according to axillary
lymph node status are summarized in Table 3.
LVI and BVI were found more frequently in the immunos-
tained sections than the H&E-stained sections (Table 4;
Figure 2). We detected LVI in 38/123 cases (30.9%) and
BVI in 21/123 cases (17.1%), when adding the two detec-
tion methods. In 11/123 cases we detected BVI and LVI in
the same case. In 10/123 cases we detected only BVI and
in 27/123 cases only LVI. Cohen's Kappa for the diagnos-
tic agreement between both methods was moderate for
lymphatic vessel invasion (Kappa = 0.433) and poor for
blood vessel invasion (Kappa = 0.198) (Table 4). Table 4
includes three cases of LVI detected in H&E-stained slides
that were not found in IHC sections. The foci of LVI in
these cases were extremely small and a single focus was
present in each case. These extremely small foci were not
present on the deeper sections used for IHC. The same sit-
uation occurred in two cases of BVI (Table 4). In our cases,
we did not detect emboli in sections that were D2-40 pos-
itive and consecutively CD31 negative. All cases that
showed red blood cells inside the lumen and tumor
emboli, were D2-40 negative and CD31 positive, and
these vessels were considered blood vessels.
Results of the LVI and BVI assessed by H&E and immuno-
histochemistry are summarized in Table 5.

endothelium of lymphatic vessels without invasion was also immunostained.

LVI was positively related to the presence of metastases (p
= 0.002) (Table 5), and was more frequently found in the
subgroup with macrometastases (12/17 cases). No rela-
tionship was observed between BVI and the presence of
metastases (p = 0.81).
Tumors with LVI showed higher histologic grade (p =
0.013), an increased Ki67 score (p = 0.00013), and high
mitotic score (p = 0.0002), but lower estrogen (p =
0.0016) and lower progesterone (p = 0.00017) receptor
scores. The other variables (p53, Her2/neu and E-cad-
herin) did not show any relation to LVI and/or BVI and
lymph node status (Tables 2 and 3).
Since several of these variables are correlated, we used a
logistic regression analysis with the lymphatic invasion as
the dependent variable and the aforementioned variables
as the independent ones, including the histologic grade.
The following variables entered the final regression
model, which classified 82.93% of the cases correctly: pro-
gesterone score (B=-0.3295; p = 0.0283) and Ki67 score (B
= 0.7184; p = 0.0055). In contrast, we could not find a sig-
nificant logistic regression model for BVI regarding the
aforementioned variables.
No relationship was observed between age of patients,
histologic tumor type and LVI or BVI (p > 0.05). BVI was
positively related to tumor size (p = 0.009), and was more
frequent in tumors greater than 2 cm. No relationship was
observed between LVI and tumor size.
In addition to lymphatic vessel endothelium, the D2-40
antibody also stained myoepithelial cells of normal ducts
and lobules in the breast parenchyma adjacent to the
tumor in all 123 cases.
Discussion
Our study confirmed that D2-40 stains the endothelium
of lymphatic vessels and is useful and reliable in detecting
LVI in invasive mammary carcinomas. In our study, LVI
was related to breast cancers with high aggressive features
(high Ki67 score, high histologic grade, negative hormone
receptors expression). We found an inverse correlation
between ER and PR expression and LVI. Similar to our
study, other authors found a correlation between high his-
tologic grade and Ki67 score to LVI, and a significantly
increased risk for tumor recurrence or deaths regardless of
axillary node status [3,16,35]. Instead of being explained
by stroma retraction artifacts, as proposed by Acs et al
[36], these correlations could be explained by the biologic
properties of the tumor. Tumors with LVI are less differen-
tiated, fast-growing and high grade tumors that offer
greater clonal variety of tumor cells. Therefore, there is
greater chance of cells capable of invading lymphatic ves-
sels compared with low-grade, slow-growing tumors [3].
The pathophysiology of tumor related blood vessels is
completely different. Capillaries are feeder vessels that
ensure tissue viability, and promote tumor growth and
nutrition in malignant tumors. Lymphatic vessels, on the
other hand, are draining vessels that are not essential for
tumor metabolism and therefore would not provide any

advantage for tumor growth or survival [3,15]. Tumor vas-
culature has a markedly different phenotype from normal
vessels, and it is highly likely that tumor lymphatic vessels
also differ significantly from normal. Gene array studies
on lymphatic endothelium isolated from tumors will
therefore be of major interest to help develop new mark-
ers relevant to tumor therapy and outcome [27].
E-cadherin, an integral part of adherens junction, main-
tains the integrity of epithelial cells by facilitating cell-cell
adhesion [32]. Decreased expression of E-cadherin in
invasive ductal carcinomas has been correlated with
higher histologic tumor grade [37,38]. We found no rela-
tionship between E-cad expression and LVI and BVI, as
well as histologic grade and type and other immunohisto-
chemical features of the primary tumor (ER, PR, Ki67,
p53, and Her2/neu expressions), confirming results of
other studies [39].
To our knowledge, this is the first study that has assessed
LVI in breast cancer evaluating cases stratified in sub-
groups according to axillary lymph node status. LVI was
positively related to status of axillary lymph node. LVI
detected by both H&E and IHC was superior in the sub-
group with macrometastases (39% by IHC and 29.3% by
H&E), compared with the other subgroups. Our results
show that LVI detected by D2-40 staining can more relia-

[5,20,36,40]. The Kappa score obtained in our study
showed only moderate agreement regarding the LVI,
when comparing the H&E and immunohistochemical
methods. The increased accuracy of LVI detection using
IHC was previously demonstrated in breast cancer

[3,5,13,16,20] and in other tumors, such as melanoma
[41] and gastric cancer [4].
It has long been suggested that LVI, as a diagnostic repro-
ducible feature, should be considered outside the tumor
margin [3,13]. Yamauchi et al examined intratumoral,
peritumoral and tumor emboli distant from tumoral
areas, and despite the localization of the emboli they rec-
ommend a combination of H&E and D2-40 staining if
pathologists find tumor nests suspicious of being emboli
in H&E [16]. Peritumoral vascular invasion, especially
lymph vascular invasion, has been included as an adverse
prognostic factor in the guidelines and recommendations
for postoperative adjuvant systemic therapies of early
breast cancer by the International Consensus Panel during
St Gallen Conference, 2005 [42]. The presence of peritu-
moral vascular invasion defined an intermediate risk for
patients with node-negative breast disease, but its value in
patients with node-positive breast disease was considered
uncertain and insufficient at that time [27].
Our results are in agreement with a previous study that
compared D2-40 and podoplanin on paraffin sections of
a series of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Both
antibodies were shown to have extremely high specificity
(99.7% and 98.8% for podoplanin and D2-40) and sensi-
tivity (92.6% and 97.3% for podoplanin and D2-40) for
lymphatic endothelium [19]. A comparison of different
endothelial lymphatic markers showed that the sensitivity
of D2-40 to recognize intratumoral lymphatic vessels on
serial sections of breast carcinomas is higher than that of
LYVE-1, podoplanin or Prox-1 [20].
In our series, the D2-40 also stained myoepithelial cells of
normal ducts and lobules of the adjacent peritumoral
parenchyma. Although the antibody selectively stained
the lymphatic vessel endothelium and was negative in
blood vessel endothelium, it is not a specific lymphatic
marker. Besides myoepithelial cells of human breast [15],
it has been observed that D2-40 also stains basal epithelial
cell layers of the epidermis [41] and prostate gland [43].
Conclusion
Our results show that D2-40 is a useful tool for identifica-
tion of LVI in breast carcinomas. LVI is related to tumors
with higher aggressive features reflecting a potential for
lymphatic metastatic spread and possible poor prognosis.
