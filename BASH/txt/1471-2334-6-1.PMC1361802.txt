Abstract
Background: Anemia is common in HIV infection and independently associated with disease progression and mortality.
The pathophysiology of HIV-related anemia is not well understood especially in infancy.
Methods: We conducted a longitudinal cohort study nested within the Zimbabwe Vitamin A for Mothers and Babies
Project. We measured hemoglobin, erythropoietin (EPO), serum transferrin receptor (TfR) and serum ferritin at 6
weeks, 3 and 6 months of age and hemoglobin at 9 and 12 months in 3 groups of randomly selected infants: 136 born to
HIV-negative mothers, and 99 born to HIV-positive mothers and who were infected themselves by 6 weeks of age, and
324 born to HIV-positive mothers but who did not become infected in the 6 months following birth.
Results: At one year of age, HIV-positive infants were 5.26 (adjusted odds ratio, P < 0.001) times more likely to be
anemic compared to HIV-negative infants. Among, HIV-negative infants, EPO was or tended to be inversely associated
with hemoglobin and was significantly positively associated with TfR throughout the first 6 months of life; TfR was
significantly inversely associated with ferritin at 6 months; and EPO explained more of the variability in TfR than did
ferritin. Among infected infants, the inverse association of EPO to hemoglobin was attenuated during early infancy, but
significant at 6 months. Similar to HIV-negative infants, EPO was significantly positively associated with TfR throughout
the first 6 months of life. However, the inverse association between TfR and ferritin observed among HIV-negative infants
at 6 months was not observed among infected infants. Between birth and 6 months, mean serum ferritin concentration
declined sharply (by ~90%) in all three groups of babies, but was significantly higher among HIV-positive compared to
HIV-negative babies at all time points.
Conclusion: HIV strongly increases anemia risk and confounds interpretation of hematologic indicators in infants.
Among HIV-infected infants, the EPO response to anemia is attenuated near the time of infection in the first weeks of
life, but normalizes by 6 months.

Background
By the end of 2003, an estimated 2.1 million children
worldwide were living with HIV [1]. Almost all infected
children acquire HIV from their mother in utero, during
delivery or during breastfeeding. Nearly 90% of pediatric
infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where many coun-
tries report that more than one in five pregnant women
visiting antenatal clinics are HIV-infected. In the absence
of antiretroviral therapy, nearly one-third of vertically
infected children living in the developed world rapidly
progress to AIDS or death in the first year of life [2]. It is
likely that HIV disease progression is rapid in resource-
poor countries because of the high prevalence of other
childhood infections and nutrient deficiencies. Anemia is
a common complication of HIV infection and is inde-
pendently associated with disease progression and mor-
tality [3,4]. The pathophysiology of HIV-related anemia is
not well understood and may be especially complicated
amidst the dynamic changes associated with normal
hematological development in early infancy.
Anemia in HIV-infected adults has the characteristics of
the "anemia of chronic disease" [5] and is associated with
an impaired erythropoietin (EPO) response to anemia [6]
and failure to mobilize iron from liver stores [7]. It is
believed that proinflammatory cytokines may play a role
in the suppression of erythropoiesis during HIV infection
[8-10]. However, in a recent study among 12-month old
HIV-infected Malawian infants, EPO response to anemia
was not different than the response in uninfected infants
[11]. Other factors that may contribute to anemia during
HIV infection include the direct effect of HIV-1 on bone
marrow cells, adverse reactions to antiretroviral drugs,
opportunistic infections and neoplasms infiltrating the
bone marrow, vitamin B12 or iron deficiency, autoim-
mune hemolytic anemia, circulating anti-EPO autoanti-
bodies, and other coexisting medical conditions [5].
For the present study, we used a model of the relation-
ships between indicators of iron status and erythropoiesis
(Figure 1) to guide our examination of erythropoiesis in
young infants and the impact of HIV infection on the
process. EPO is secreted by the kidney in response to
hypoxia [12] inducing the bone marrow to synthesize
more red blood cells and maintaining their viability as
they differentiate [13,14]. Provided there is a normal
EPO-generating apparatus in the kidney, plasma EPO will
increase exponentially as circulating hemoglobin
decreases, which in the presence of a sufficient iron
reserve, increases the number of red cells and corrects the
hypoxia. Transferrin receptors (TfRs) present on the sur-
face of erythroid cells increase with the expansion of the
erythroid mass, and a soluble truncated form of the tissue
receptor increases proportionally in the serum [15-17].
During iron deficiency, ferritin levels decrease. The
number of TfRs per cell increases in an effort to gather
more iron, and circulating levels of TfR increase. Accord-
ing to this model, TfR levels do not distinguish between
functional iron deficiency (more TfRs per cell) and an
increase in red cell number (simply more cells, i.e., eryth-
ropoiesis). We hypothesized that, in HIV-uninfected
babies, the following relationships would be found: (1)
EPO would be inversely associated with hemoglobin,
reflecting the erythropoietic response to anemia; (2) EPO
would be positively associated with TfR, reflecting the
erythroid expansion in response to EPO; (3) ferritin
would be inversely associated with TfR, reflecting the
depletion of iron stores when erythropoiesis is stimulated
in the presence or absence of adequate iron stores; and (4)
at 6 weeks and 3 months, the EPO concentration would
explain more variability in TfR concentration than ferritin
(i.e., the association between TfR and EPO would be
stronger than the association between TfR and ferritin). At
6 months, the approximate age at which iron can become
a limiting nutrient in normal birthweight infants, ferritin
concentration would explain more variability in TfR than
EPO, and ferritin would be positively associated with
hemoglobin, reflecting the relation between iron stores
and hemoglobin production.
We expected that HIV infection would modify these rela-
tionships, but there was insufficient evidence about the
specific perturbations in the regulation of erythropoiesis
to posit hypotheses. Among HIV-negative infants born to
HIV-positive mothers, we speculated that the indicators of

erythropoiesis may be transiently perturbed during early
infancy, but would normalize with infant age.
We conducted a longitudinal cohort study nested within
the Zimbabwe Vitamin A for Mothers and Babies Project
(ZVITAMBO). The specific aims of the nested study were:
(1) to describe the course of changes in hemoglobin and
other indicators of anemia and iron status in a group of
breast-fed Zimbabwean infants, stratified by maternal and
infant HIV status; (2) to examine the validity of this
model (see Figure 1) during early infancy by testing our
hypotheses at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months of age among HIV-
positive babies and HIV-negative babies of HIV-positive
and negative mothers. From these analyses, we make
inferences about the usefulness of TfR as an indicator of
iron deficiency in this age group and the pathophysiology
of anemia in these babies according to their HIV status.
Methods
Study population
Subjects were drawn from participants of ZVITAMBO,
which enrolled 14,110 mother-baby pairs within 96
hours of delivery from maternity clinics and hospitals in
Harare between November 1997 and January 2000 to
study the impact of maternal and neonatal vitamin A sup-
plementation on several outcomes [18-20]. Pairs were eli-
gible if neither the mother nor the baby had an acutely life
threatening condition and the infant was a singleton with
birthweight >1500 g. Written informed consent was
obtained from the mother. At the time the study was car-
ried out, neither vitamin A supplementation nor HIV
antiretroviral therapy was part of routine perinatal or
postnatal care. Among infants enrolled beginning in
October 1998, a 34% sub-sample (seven of every eight
born to HIV-positive mothers and one of every ten born
to HIV-negative mothers) was randomly selected for the
anemia substudy, to yield an adequate sample size among
HIV-positive and HIV-negative infants to detect a 5 g/L
difference in hemoglobin concentration. Babies who had
received a blood transfusion during the neonatal period
were excluded from the anemia substudy. Only babies
assigned to the placebo control group (i.e., both mother
and baby received placebo) were included in the present
analysis for a total of 136 and 575 babies born to HIV-
negative and HIV-positive mothers, respectively. The ZVI-
TAMBO trial protocol was approved by the Medical
Research Council of Zimbabwe (MRC-Z), the Committee
on Human Research of The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg
School of Public Health (CHR-JHBSPH), the Medicines
Control Authority of Zimbabwe, and the Montreal Gen-
eral Hospital Research Ethics Committee. The MRC-Z and
the CHR-JHBSPH provided further approval to conduct
additional laboratory analyses for this anemia substudy.
Procedures
At recruitment, demographic and obstetric information
was collected by maternal history or transcription from
the medical record. Gestational age was estimated using
the method of Capurro [21]. Birthweight was measured
within 96 hours of delivery to the nearest 5 g using an
electronic scale (Seca model 727, Hanover, MD). Mothers
and babies were followed at 6 weeks, 3 months and there-
after 3 monthly up to 24 months of age in a study clinic
or at home. Detailed infant feeding information, includ-
ing breast-feeding status and whether or not any of 22
nonmilk liquids, nonhuman milks (animal milks and
commercial formula), medicines (traditional fluids, oral
rehydration salts, other prescribed), or solid foods had
ever been given to the infant were collected at enrolment,
6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after delivery.
Medical care, including treatment of acute illness, and
counseling for pre- and post- HIV test, psycho-social sup-
port, and infant feeding, were offered throughout the trial;
travel costs to the follow-up clinic were reimbursed.
Blood collection and processing
At baseline and each follow-up visit, study midwives col-
lected maternal and infant blood by venipuncture or heel-
stick (capillary) into clot and EDTA tubes. Maternal and
infant serum and plasma were prepared and stored at -
70°C within two hours of phlebotomy. Aliquots of infant
whole blood were refrigerated and cell pellets prepared
(Amplicor whole blood PCR sample preparation method;
Roche Diagnostics Systems, Alameda, CA, USA) generally
within a few days of collection and stored at -70°C. Aliq-
uots of baseline maternal serum were refrigerated.
Maternal HIV testing
Refrigerated maternal serum was tested for HIV status by
two ELISA assays for detecting antibody to both HIV 1 and
2 [GeneScreen (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur PRx, Johannes-
burg, South Africa) and Murex (Murex Diagnostics, Johan-
nesburg, South Africa)] run in parallel. Discordant ELISA
results were resolved by Western Blot. CD4 cells from
maternal baseline samples that tested HIV positive were
enumerated using a Facscount (Becton Dickinson Interna-
tional, Erembodegem, Belgium) within 48 hours of phle-
botomy.
Infant HIV diagnosis
After all patient contact was completed, the last available
infant specimen was tested for HIV (plasma by ELISA for
samples collected at >18 months; pellets by Amplicor
HIV-1 DNA test version 1.5 (Roche Diagnostic Systems)
for samples collected at younger ages). If this sample was
HIV-negative, the baby was classified as negative and no
further testing was carried out. If the last sample was HIV-

positive, samples collected at intervening time points
were tested to determine the timing of infection.
Hemoglobin and iron parameter assays
Hemoglobin was measured on whole blood samples on
the day of collection for all mothers at baseline and for all
infants in the anemia substudy at baseline and visits up to
12 months using the HemoCue hemoglobinometer
(HemoCue, Mission Viejo, CA). Daily quality control of
the instrument was performed. Hemoglobin data were
unavailable if the baby missed the study visit, or if the
blood sample was insufficient as a result of the mother's
refusal for her baby to give blood, inadequate sample vol-
ume, sample clotting, or failure by the laboratory to per-
form the test before the end of the day in which the
specimen had been drawn.
We measured TfR, ferritin and EPO concentrations in
plasma (or serum when plasma was unavailable). TfR
concentrations were measured by enzyme immunoassay
(Ramco Laboratories, Houston, TX) (intra-assay coeffi-
cient of variation, 3.9% at 6.7 mg/L and 2.7% at 13.2 mg/
L; inter-assay coefficient of variation, 8.8% and 6.6%,
respectively); ferritin by enzyme-linked immunoassay
(Ramco Laboratories) (intraassay coefficient of variation,
4.0% at 70 µg/L and 4.7% at 300 µg/L; inter-assay coeffi-
cient of variation, 9.6% and 9.2%, respectively); and EPO
using the Quantikine In Vitro Diagnostic EPO ELISA
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (intra-assay coefficient
of variation, 2.3% at 42 IU/L and 2.4 at 13 IU/L; inter-
assay coefficient of variation, 5.2% and 3.4%, respec-
tively).
Definitions
The criteria we used to diagnose anemia were modified
from those of the World Health Organization [22]. Sev-
eral studies have suggested that during infancy, the WHO
cut-off value of 110 g/L may overestimate anemia [23-25];
therefore, we used a more stringent cut-off value of 105 g/
L [26]. We did not define anemia in infants younger than
3 mo of age, because hemoglobin does not reflect iron sta-
tus in early infancy but reflects a normal physiologic
decline in concentration. Low plasma ferritin concentra-
tion is considered to be an accurate indicator of iron stores
in the liver [27,28]. We used the WHO standard of 12 µg/
L to indicate absent or depleted iron stores in infants aged
up to 6 months.
Statistical analysis
Plasma EPO, TfR, and ferritin concentrations were nor-
malized by log transformation; geometric means (95%
CI) are reported. Differences across HIV status groups in
baseline characteristics and indicators of anemia and iron
status were examined by ANOVA for continuous variables
and the chi-squared test of homogeneity for categorical
variables. We used multivariate linear and logistic regres-
sion analysis to compare hemoglobin values and the pro-
portion of anemic children across HIV status groups and
adjusted for birthweight in these models. The association
between indicators of anemia and iron status was exam-
ined by linear regression and partial correlation coeffi-
cients. The relevant interaction terms between the
independent variable and HIV status groups were
included in regression models to examine differences in
the association between indicators by HIV status group.
Adjusting for birthweight in these models did not change
the conclusions, and, therefore, was not included. We per-
formed a likelihood ratio test to determine the overall sta-
tistical significance of the interaction between HIV status
and the independent variable. For all analyses, we set the
significance levels at α = 0.05. A Bonferroni correction was
used to determine which associations were unlikely to be
the result of chance alone.
We created three categories of babies: the 136 babies born
to HIV-negative mothers (Nn group) and two groups of
babies born to HIV-positive mothers: (1) babies who
tested PCR negative at 6 months or later (Pn group, n =
324); and (2) babies who tested PCR-positive at baseline
or 6 weeks (Pp group, n = 99). Babies who did not fall
neatly into these three groups were excluded from the
analysis. These included those who tested PCR-positive
for the first time at 3 or 6 months (n = 37), and babies
with an indeterminate HIV status (n = 115). Babies were
classified as HIV-indeterminate if maternal baseline HIV
status was unknown (n = 2) or maternal baseline status
was positive and no results were available for the baby (n
= 2), the baby's last available PCR result was prior to 6
months of age and was negative (n = 108), or the baby's
PCR results were inconsistent such that a negative result
followed a positive result (n = 3). Only 4 infants in the Nn
group and 3 in the Pn group died by 12 months of age, but
among Pp infants, 33 (33.3%) had died by 6 months of
age and 51 (51.5%) by 12 months.
We carried out the analysis only on the available data, and
did not impute values for missing observations. Hemo-
globin values >160 g/L at 6 weeks (n = 1), 3 months (n =
1) and 6 months (n = 4) were excluded from the analysis.
All analyses were performed with the use of Stata (verson
8.0, Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).
Results
Compared to HIV-negative mothers (Nn), HIV-positive
mothers (Pn and Pp) had lower hemoglobin concentra-
tions and were more likely to be anemic, older and of
higher parity (Table 1). Among HIV-positive mothers,
those whose babies remained PCR-negative at 6 months
(Pn) had higher CD4 counts than those whose babies
were PCR-positive by 6 weeks (Pp). Babies who were PCR-

positive for HIV by 6 weeks (Pp) had lower mean birth-
weight and mean length.
Breastfeeding was nearly universal among infants in ZVI-
TAMBO, but exclusive breastfeeding was rare [19]. Non-
breastmilk foods or liquids, were introduced to 90.2% of
infants in the anemia substudy by 3 months and to 95.0%
by 6 months, though very rarely did these foods include
iron-rich sources, i.e., meat, poultry, eggs, fish, or iron-for-
tified infant formula. The common infant foods were
juice and porridge made from maize meal and diluted
with water. There were no statistically significant differ-
ences in patterns of infant feeding among the 3 HIV status
groups.
Anemia and iron status
The only difference in indicators of anemia and iron status
between Nn and Pn babies was a significantly higher TfR
concentration at 6 weeks of age in Pn babies (P = 0.001; P
= 0.003, Bonferroni adjusted) (Table 2). In both HIV-
infected and uninfected babies, mean hemoglobin con-
centration decreased dramatically from birth to 6 weeks,
in a pattern consistent with the postnatal physiologic
decline, but did not rise again (Figure 2). HIV-infected
babies had the lowest 6 week concentration even after
adjusting for birthweight (mean ± SE; 103 ± 3.0 g/L), sig-
nificantly lower than that of babies born to HIV-negative
mothers (114 ± 3.1 g/L, P = 0.008; P = 0.024, Bonferroni
adjusted). From this nadir, hemoglobin slightly increased,
but the improvement was not sustained beyond 3 months
of age, after which hemoglobin progressively declined to
significantly lower values than either Nn or Pn babies at 9
and 12 months of age. By 6 months, the odds of anemia
(hemoglobin < 105 g/L) was more than two-fold greater
among HIV-positive babies compared to HIV-negative
babies (59.8% vs. 36.6%, adjusted for birthweight, P =
0.021). At 12 months, 36.6% of HIV-negative babies were
anemic and 75.9% of HIV-positive babies (adjusted odds
ratio = 5.45 (95% CI: 2.22, 13.4; P < 0.001) were anemic.
Plasma ferritin concentration decreased from birth levels
as expected with the physiologic mobilization of iron
from liver stores in all HIV status groups. However, at all
time points, including birth, the ferritin distribution was
shifted to higher values among HIV-infected babies. For
example, at 3 months, geometric mean [95% CI] ferritin
concentration was significantly greater among HIV-posi-
tive infants (140.7 [103.8, 190.7], n = 52) compared to
HIV-negative infants (59.8 [54.5,65.6], n = 279; P <
0.0001). At 6 months, serum ferritin was not associated

with hemoglobin in any HIV status group. Geometric
mean plasma EPO increased with age and TfR increased to
3 months then leveled off (see Table 2). Compared to
HIV-negative babies, mean EPO concentration was signif-
icantly higher among HIV-positive infants at 6 weeks, 3
months, and 6 months, and mean TfR was higher at 6
weeks and 3 months.
Relation of EPO to anemia
Among Nn and Pn infants, the slope of the fitted regres-
sion line between log10 plasma EPO (U/L) and hemo-
globin (i.e., the EPO response to anemia) was
significantly negative at 6 weeks; this association
remained at 3 months and 6 months but was only signif-
icant among the Pn infants (see Additional file 1). Among
Pp infants, the EPO response to anemia was attenuated at
6 weeks and 3 months, but significant at 6 months.
Among Nn babies, the EPO response to anemia became
weaker with age, while among Pn and Pp babies, the
response was stronger at 6 months than at 6 weeks or 3
months.
Relation of TfR to EPO
TfR and EPO were positively associated at all ages and for
all HIV status groups. A significant interaction with HIV
status was observed at 3 months of age. The increase in
loge plasma TfR (mg/L) for one log10 decrease in plasma
EPO (U/L) was significantly greater for Pp babies com-
pared to Pn babies (P = 0.023), and there was a trend for
a greater increase when compared to Nn babies (P = 0.11).
Relation of ferritin to TfR
There was no consistent or significant relation between
ferritin and TfR at 6 weeks or 3 months. However, there
was a significant interaction between HIV status and TfR
on ferritin concentration at 6 months (P = 0.01). Ferritin
was inversely associated with TfR in HIV-negative infants
born to HIV-positive and HIV-negative mothers but not in
HIV-positive infants.
Variability in TfR
To compare the relative strength of association between
TfR and ferritin vs. EPO, we examined the partial correla-
tion coefficients between these variables. TfR was more
strongly correlated with EPO than ferritin in all HIV status
groups at every age, after adjusting for hemoglobin. There
was a strong inverse association between TfR and ferritin
only at 6 months in Pn infants, but, even then, more of
the variability in TfR was explained by EPO concentration
than ferritin.
Discussion
In this study of Zimbabwean babies, anemia was preva-
lent and strongly influenced by HIV infection. Though
HIV infected and uninfected infants had similar hemo-
globin distributions at birth, by 12 months of age infected
infants had a nearly 20 g/L lower mean hemoglobin and
they were >5 times as likely to be anemic, even after
adjusting for their lower birthweight.
Our model of the relationships between indicators of iron
status and erythropoiesis proved valid among HIV-nega-
tive infants. The data support the hypothesized relation-
ships between indicators of erythropoiesis: EPO was
inversely associated with hemoglobin and positively asso-
ciated with TfR; TfR was inversely associated with ferritin
(although weakly at 6 weeks and 3 months); and EPO
explained more variability than ferritin in TfR concentra-
tion.
HIV infection perturbed the normal feedback system and
modified some, but not all, of the hypothesized relation-
ships. The EPO response to anemia among HIV-infected
infants was attenuated during early infancy but normal-
ized at 6 months of age. HIV infection did not seem to
affect the bone marrow response to stimulation by EPO,
i.e., TfR increased in direct response to increased EPO lev-
els, at all ages. However at 6 months, this drive in red
blood cell production was not accompanied by the
expected decline in ferritin in HIV-infected infants.
A limitation of the present study was the high rate of miss-
ing values for indicators of anemia and erythropoiesis.
Infant blood samples were unavailable if the mother-baby
pair defaulted, the infant died, or if the blood sample was
insufficient. It is possible that these losses could have
biased the results, but there were no statistically signifi-
cant differences in any measured baseline maternal factor
between infants followed versus not followed. We did
observe a statistically significant difference in preterm
birth between infants who came for the 6 month visit and
those who did not, but the impact of preterm on the like-
lihood of missing values was similar across HIV status
groups and likely did not bias the results. Insufficient
blood sample as a result of either inadequate quantity or
quality, e.g., the sample clotted before hemoglobin was
measured) was not associated with HIV status. Finally,
survival rates were certainly associated with infant HIV
status with approximately half of HIV-positive infants
dead by 6 months, but very few deaths among uninfected
infants. Thus a survival bias is possible and should be con-
sidered in light of the study findings.
Iron deficiency
One-third of HIV-negative infants had serum ferritin con-
centration <12 µg/L at 6 months suggesting that their ane-
mia was largely caused by iron deficiency. Worldwide, the
primary cause of anemia among infants is iron deficiency
[29]. Infants have a relatively high demand for iron
because they are rapidly growing, and human milk is low

in iron, even after accounting for good bioavailability. In
most developing countries, complementary food diets are
largely plant-based and high in substances that inhibit
iron absorption and are by themselves insufficient to meet
dietary needs for iron [30-32]. Foods with naturally high
iron content and high bioavailability, such as meat, and
iron-fortified infant formula are rarely consumed. We too
observed these infant-feeding patterns in the present
study. Furthermore, ~one-third of the mothers of HIV-
uninfected infants were anemic (hemoglobin <110 g/L) at
delivery, which is also a risk factor for infant anemia
[33,34].
In the absence of concurrent disease, serum ferritin paral-
lels total body iron stores and can reflect deficient, nor-
mal, and excess iron stores [27]. However, ferritin is also
a positive acute phase protein and can rise in the presence
of infection or inflammation [35]. Among the HIV-posi-
tive infants in this study, we conclude that serum ferritin
more strongly reflected concurrent infection than iron sta-
tus because: a) it was consistently higher among HIV-
infected infants compared to HIV-negative infants; and,
b) it was inversely associated with TfR among uninfected
infants but not among HIV positive infants. A measure of
immune activation would have provided further clarifica-
tion and should be incorporated into future studies.
Inadequate EPO response
Our findings that the EPO response to anemia was
blunted in HIV-infected babies at 6 weeks and slightly
attenuated at 3 months of age are consistent with several
reports of studies carried out in HIV-infected adults
[6,9,36]. This attenuation is thought to be through inhibi-
tion by inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and
tumor necrosis factor, or EPO gene transcription
[10,37,38]. However, by 6 months of age, the EPO
response to anemia was not different than that observed
among uninfected infants. In fact, mean log10 EPO con-
centration was highest in Pp infants at all ages, even after
adjusting for hemoglobin concentration (data not
shown). To our knowledge, the only other study, in addi-
tion to the present, to compare EPO in HIV-infected and
uninfected infants was carried out in Malawi, and they too
did not show an inadequate EPO response among HIV-
infected infants [11]. It is noteworthy that the infants in
the Malawi study were 12 months-old. They, like the

infant.

babies in the present study at 6 months of age, represent a
different stage in physiological development than 6 week
old infants. It is not surprising that the age of the infant
plays a crucial role in the regulation of erythropoiesis and
perturbation to the system. These ages span highly signif-
icant changes in normal hematological development
characterized by a switch in the site of EPO production
from the liver to the kidney, greater oxygen consumption
with increasing activity and growth, and a switch from
fetal to adult hemoglobin with a decrease in oxygen affin-
ity favoring oxygen delivery.
The apparent transient impact of HIV on the EPO
response to anemia might suggest that the attenuating
effect on EPO is more pronounced closer to the time of
initial infection and weakens with progression of HIV dis-
ease. Acute HIV infection is characterized by a peak in
viremia and rapid decline in CD4+ cells, but an immuno-
logic response ensues resulting in a lowering of the
plasma level of HIV RNA to a steady state "set point" that
reflects a balance between production and destruction of
virions [39]. It is possible that we have observed this
steady state in HIV infected infants at 6 months of age.
Alternatively, the higher mean EPO levels in the Pp group
may be explained by dyserythropoiesis (due to a direct
effect of HIV and/or through cytokine activation) or
reduced number of stem cells in HIV infected infants.
However, we observed a strong relationship between EPO
and TfR suggesting that bone marrow cells are responding
to stimulation by EPO. A measure of reticulocyte count
would be helpful to clarify this mechanism and should be
considered in future studies of infant hematopoiesis.
Finally, we speculate that the stronger EPO response
observed in Pp infants at 6 months may in part be attrib-
uted to a survival bias. We compared the EPO-Hb slope
among Pp infants who died by 12 months of age to that
of Pp infants who survived to 12 months. Only 2 infants
who died in the first year had both EPO and Hb measure-
ments at 6 months of age making it impossible to estimate
the slope in this group at 6 months. A comparison of the
slopes at 3 months of age showed a trend for a flatter slope
among those who died (+0.0072) than among those who
survived (-0.0017) suggesting greater attenuation of the
EPO-Hb association among those who died and, perhaps,
unique resilience among those who survived. On the
other hand, the slope at 6 weeks was steeper among
infants who died (-0.0042) than among those who sur-
vived (-0.0025) and more like that observed among Pn
infants (-0.0044). This post hoc analysis was limited by
sample size, and differences among HIV-infected infants
who survive and among those who die should be further
explored.
It is important to note that the inverse association
between EPO and hemoglobin was not statistically signif-
icant in Nn babies at 3 and 6 months of age. The failure to
reach statistical significance may in part be attributed to a
lack of sample size since slopes of similar magnitude in
the Pn group were statistically significant. However, the
data also suggest a relatively weak inverse association
between these indicators. In fact, the observed slopes of
the regression line between log10 EPO and hemoglobin
(g/L), even the steepest observed value (-0.0109) in Pp
infants at 6 months, were less steep than values previously
reported in the literature. The values of slopes for control
groups comprised of HIV-uninfected infants [11], chil-
dren with iron deficiency anemia [40] and sickle cell dis-
ease [41], and children with hematological disease [42]
have ranged from -0.011 to -0.0553. Young children in
developing countries are often sick, with the prevalence of
diarrhea ranging from 10 to 19 percent [43-45], and the
prevalence of acute respiratory illness among young chil-
dren in developing countries even higher, 25 to 60 percent
[46]. We speculate that the inflammatory response to
common childhood infections may have caused an atten-
uation of the EPO response to anemia. Additionally, vita-
min A has been shown to stimulate EPO production in
cell culture and animal models [47-50]. Thus, it is possi-
ble that vitamin A deficiency might have reduced the EPO
response to low hemoglobin concentrations.

Impaired iron mobilization
A noteworthy effect of HIV infection on erythropoiesis
was the modification of infant infection on the associa-
tion between ferritin and TfR at 6 months of age. The
absence of a negative association between TfR and serum
ferritin in HIV-infected babies may be explained by con-
founding due to infection, yet it is consistent with the
sequestration of iron in liver stores during infection. The
concurrent lack of association at 6 months between ferri-
tin and hemoglobin supports this explanation since an
increase in ferritin did not translate into increased hemo-
globin production. However, these results should be
interpreted with caution since serum ferritin is an acute
phase protein and elevated during infection and inflam-
mation [35] at which times the indicator has limited abil-
ity to accurately reflect iron stores. The lack of association
between ferritin and hemoglobin that we observed at 6
months in all HIV status groups supports the notion that
ferritin levels do not specifically reflect iron stores but are
also affected by infection status.
TfR as an indicator of erythropoiesis
The observation that at all ages and in all HIV groups, EPO
concentration explained more variability in TfR levels
than did serum ferritin concentration suggests that TfR is
not primarily an indicator of iron deficiency in this age
group. We speculate that during periods of high erythro-
poietic activity (e.g. early infancy), an increase in TfR more
strongly reflects an increase in erythroblasts (i.e. erythro-
poiesis) rather than an increase in the density of receptors
per red blood cell consistent with tissue iron deficiency.
While the strong and consistent association between TfR
and EPO is striking, particularly when compared to the
lack of association between TfR and ferritin, it was not sur-
prising that ferritin did not explain much of the variability
in TfR given its association with infection and inflamma-
tion.
Conclusion
We conclude that HIV-related anemia is associated with
attenuation in the EPO response to anemia in early
infancy, but that the EPO response is normalized by 6
months. Throughout the first 6 months of infancy, HIV-
infected babies have higher serum ferritin concentrations,
which could reflect iron sequestration in liver stores, or an
acute phase response. If the elevated serum ferritins in
infected babies are explained by inflammation, then the
HIV-related anemia might be explained by a shortened
red cell lifespan [12] or by increased hepatic hepcidin pro-
duction leading to downregulated intestinal iron absorp-
tion and retention of iron in reticuloendothelial
macrophages, causing iron deficient erythropoiesis [51].
These hypotheses should be investigated in future
research. With regard to assessment of iron status, we
found that the serum ferritin distribution was shifted sig-
nificantly to the right in HIV-infected babies even at birth,
and that TfR behaved primarily as an indicator of erythro-
poiesis in all infants. Both indicators should be used cau-
tiously as indicators of iron deficiency in babies.
