Implications. An Overview

Aromatic amines belong to a group of compounds that exert their toxic effects usually after oxidative biotransformation, primarily in the liver. In addition,
aromatic amines also undergo extrahepatic activation to yield free arylaminyl radicals. The reactive intermediates are potential promutagens and pro-
carcinogens, and responsible for target tissue toxicity. Since thiols react with these intermediates at high rates, it is of interest to know the underlying
reaction mechanisms and the toxicologic implications. Phenoxyl radicals from aminophenols and aminyl radicals from phenylenediamines quickly dis-
proportionate to quinone imines and quinone diimines. Depending on the structure, Michael addition or reduction reactions with thiols may prevail.
Products of sequential oxidation/addition reactions (e.g., S-conjugates of aminophenols) are occasionally more toxic than the parent compounds
because of their higher autoxidizability and their accumulation in the kidney. Even after covalent binding of quinone imines to protein SH groups, the
resulting thioethers are able to autoxidize. The quinoid thioethers can then cross-link the protein by addition to neighboring nucleophiles. The reactions
of nitrosoarenes with thiols yield a so-called "semimercaptal" from which various branching reactions detach, depending on substituents.
Compounds with strong ic-donors, like 4-nitrosophenetol, give a resonance-stabilized N-lthiol-S-yl)-arylamine cation that may lead to bicyclic products,
thioethers, and DNA adducts. Examples of toxicologic implications of the interactions of nitroso compounds with thiols are given for nitrosoimidazoles,
heterocyclic nitroso compounds from protein pyrolysates, and nitrosoarenes. These data indicate that interactions of activated arylamines with thiols
may not be regarded exclusively as detoxication reactions. - Environ Health Perspect 102(Suppl 6):123-132 (1994)

Introduction
Aromatic amines belong to a group of
chemicals that exert their toxic effects usually
after oxidative biotransformation, primarily
in the liver. As a result, C-oxygenated and
N-oxygenated products are generated,
which can be further activated to give
electrophilic intermediates responsible for
toxic, allergic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic
effects.
The group of aminophenols can be
activated in metabolically competent cells
to give ultimate reactive intermediates like
phenoxyl radicals and quinone imines. The
phenylhydroxylamines are activated by 0-
esterification (glucuronidation, sulfatation,
acetylation) to yield carbonium-nitrenium
ions as ultimate reactive compounds that
alkylate nucleic acids under preferable for-

mation of N(deoxyguanosine-8-yl)aryl-
amine adducts (1). In addition, oxidative
activation of the phenylhydroxylamines
produces phenylhydronitroxide radicals
which react with cellular sulfhydryls to give
thiyl radicals of glutathione (GSH) and
protein sulfhydryl groups (2). The
nitrosoarenes, formed by either 2-electron
oxidation of the phenylhydroxylamines, by
1-electron oxidation of the phenylhydroni-
troxide radicals, by disproportionation of
the latter, or by reduction ofnitro aromatic
compounds, exert their toxic effects mainly
through their thiol reactivity (3).
Last, aromatic amines also undergo
extrahepatic activation to yield free aryl-
aminyl radicals (4,5). This kind of activa-
tion received more attention when it was
shown that prostaglandin hydroperoxidase
mediated the arachidonic acid-dependent
cooxidation of arylamines to DNA-bound
products (6).
Since thiols usually react at high rates
with all the aforementioned electrophilic
intermediates, it is of interest to know the
underlying reaction mechanisms and the
toxicologic implications. This article is
intended to focus not only on detoxication
reactions, as usually supposed to emergency
reactions, particularly of GSH. Evidence is
growing that thiol interaction with elec-
trophilic intermediates may produce suffi-
ciently stable transport forms that can
cause toxic effects in remote, sensitive target
organs.
Mechanisms of Thiol
Reactions with Radicals and
Quinoid Compounds
Aminyl Radcals
During our investigations on ferrihemoglo-
bin formation by p-phenylenediamines in
human red cells, we detected formation of
glutathione adducts. The same adducts
were formed when the chemically prepared
radical cations were allowed to react with
GSH. In addition, some GSSG was formed.
Since N-centered free radicals of aromatic
amines tend to disproportionate at high
rates (7), it was difficult to decide whether
redox and addition reactions with GSH
had originated directly from the radicals or
from the quinone diimines.
To reveal unambiguously the underly-
ing microscopic events, we examined reac-
tions of the stable N-alkyl-p-phenylene-
diamine radical cations (Wurster's dyes)
with GSH. Of these the N,N-dimethyl-p-
phenylenediamine radical cation
(DMPD*+) turned out to be particularly
suited for our investigations, because its

Figure 1 shows the influence ofpH and
additional DMPD (10-fold excess) on the
disproportionation equilibrium of
DMPD*+ (8). It is obvious that addition of
the inactive DMPD increases the radical
steady-state concentration 1.8-fold and
decreases the quinone diimine concentra-
tion to 1/5. By this measure, one can easily
decide whether the radical or the quinone
diimine (DMQDI+) is the ultimate reactive
compound (Table 1).
From the kinetics (stopped-flow spec-
troscopy) of disappearance of the bright
radical color in the presence of GSH, we
calculated an apparent second-order rate
constant ofabout 10 M- s-. Addition ofa
100-fold excess of DMPD resulted in a
decrease of the reaction rate by a factor of
20. This experiment clearly indicated that
the quinone diimine is the reactive inter-
mediate which reacts at pH 7.4 and 37°C

GSSG formation was negligible. Although
the disproportionation reaction of6 1 -1
DMPD*+ is very fast, k = 2 x 10 M- sec-,
some saturation kinetics was observed
when GSH was at high excess. A com-
pletely different behaviour was found with
the N,N,N'N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenedi-
amine radical cation (TMPD*+). The reac-
tion velocity with GSH was independent of
the GSH concentration below 1 mM.
Only at higher concentrations the expected
second-order reaction was found.
Thioether formation at low concentrations
of GSH pointed to a Michael addition
reaction to the quinoid compound. When
the GSH concentration was increased, the
recovery of the thioether decreased.
Instead, GSSG formation increased.
Figure 2 compares the different behavior
of the two Wurster's radicals. The disparity
is a result of the different rates of the dis-
proportionation of the radicals. With
TMPD*+, the reaction is second-order at
low GSH concentrations and yields virtu-
ally constant amounts of the thioethers.
Only at high GSH concentrations does the
disproportionation reaction become rate
limiting. This reaction is rather slow with
TMPD*+ and is obviously rate limiting
during thioether formation. At increasing
GSH, a direct reaction of GSH with the
radical is observed. During this process,
GSSG is formed and less quinone diimine
is available for addition reactions.
Conceivably, at very high GSH concentra-
tions, DMPD*+ will also react directly with
GSH at the expense of the thioethers.
Hence, both phenylenediamine radicals
show two extremes. Figure 3 schematically
compiles the whole continuum. The left
part is typical for DMPD*+, the right for
TMPD*+.

REACTIONS OF OXIDATIVELYACTIVATED ARYLAMINES WITH THIOLS
The tendency of the radicals to react
directly with GSH was very weak. With
TMPD*+ a rate of 5 M 1sec-I was deter-
mined (9), whereas with DMPD*+, the rate
is well below 1o2 M 1sec 1(8).
The mechanism of GSSG formation is
still obscure. It may result from the reaction
of GSH with both the radical and the
quinone diimine. In the latter case, ipso
adduct formation is conceivable, as already
discussed for other quinone imines
(10-12). The situation in the former case
is more puzzling.
For thermodynamic reasons, TMPD*+
with a redox potential of + 0.27 V (13) is
hardly able to be reduced by GSH with thiyl
radical formation (redox potential at pH 7.4
of about +0.9 V(14). Hence, the equilib-
rium for GS* formation is about 4 x 10-10.
TMPD*+ + GS- <- TMPD + GS* [2]
(On the assumption of an effective pKa
of 8.6 (15) for the thiol dissociation, but
ignoring other possible prototropic equilib-
ria). Of course, reactions that remove GS*
from the equilibrium will drive the reaction
to the right. The most important reactions
are the conjugation of GS* with oxygen
and GS-. The resulting radical conjugates

tions:

nol (DMAP) with oxyhemoglobin in the
presence of GSH to imitate the red cell
milieu. Oxyhemoglobin and DMAP are
cooxidized quickly with formation of a
transient NN-dimethylamino-p-phenoxyl
radical (19). This radical also was generated
by pulse radiolysis and-more conve-
niently-by reaction with stoichiometric
ferricyanide. The DMAP radical is quite
stable, although much less than the corre-
sponding DMPD radical. It decays under
physiologic conditions with an apparent
half-life of about 1 sec with formation of
dimethylamine and p-benzoquinone, indi-
cating that the decay proceeds via the
quinone imine, which is in a rapid dispro-
portionation equilibrium. Since the radical
of DMAP was nearly completely bleached
by half an equivalent of GSH, we assume
that GSH reacts primarily with the
quinone imine. In this reaction, GSSG is
hardly formed. Instead, thioethers are pro-
duced as expected from Michael addition
reactions to the quinone imine. Hence, the
radical ofDMAP appears to react very sim-
ilarly to the corresponding DMPD*+. In
contrast, the phenoxyl radical of paraceta-
mol (NAPAP) (20) produced in the horse-
radish peroxidase or prostaglandin H
synthetase reaction, was shown to react with
GSH under formation of a thiyl radical as
detected by spin-trapping (17,18).
Quinone Imines
The reactions of GSH with the quinone
imines from NAPAP, p-aminophenol, and
DMAP have been studied in some detail.
With all three compounds, thioethers were
produced, but significant amounts of
GSSG were found only with NAPAP (21).
The mechanism of GSSG formation has
been attributed to intermediate ipso
adducts which, after attack of a second
GSH molecule, yield GSSG and NAPAP
(10-12). During the reaction of the
quinone imine of p-aminophenol with
GSH, sequential oxidation/addition reac-
tions occur as revealed by a variety of poly-
substituted thioadducts. GSSG formation
was not detected (21). When the quinone
imine of DMAP, prepared chemically by
oxidation with PbO2, reacted with GSH,
some GSSG was found besides poly-
substituted thioadducts. This process also
was examined in experiments where the
oxidation was brought about by oxyhemo-
globin. As shown in Figure 4, DMAP dis-
appeared rapidly from incubates of
oxyhemoglobin and glutathione with forma-
tion of an intermediate mono-substituted
adduct, followed by a bis- and tris-substi-
tuted conjugate. Interestingly, GSSG for-
mation proceeded only after a lag phase.
With the isolated mono- and bis-gluta-
thione S-conjugates, we found that signifi-
cant GSSG formation occurred only during
the reaction of 2,6-bis(glutathione-S-yl)4-

Because GSSG*- has a very low redox
potential (-1.6 V), the overall reaction can
in fact result in slow TMPD*' reduction
and GSSG formation. [For a more in-
depth discussion of thiyl radical chemistry,
refer to Wardman (14)]. The possible
involvement of the highly reactive thiyl
radicals may cause additional oxidative
stress, as already reported for p-phenetidine
(16-18).
In conclusion, our experiments with N-
alkylated p-phenylenediamines indicate
that the main reaction with thiols is
brought about by the quinone diimines
that are usually in a rapid disproportionation
equilibrium with the radicals.

evidence has been presented that 4-amino-
2-(glutathione-S-yl)phenol is excreted in
the bile after administration of 4-amino-
phenol to rats (37). This thioether autoxi-
dizes rapidly (21,34,38) and produces
more ferrihemoglobin than the parent 4-
aminophenol (35). Recently, it has been
shown that another isomeric thioether, 4-
amino-3-(glutathione-S-yl)phenol is
markedly more nephrotoxic in Fischer 344
rats than 4-aminophenol (39). The kidney-
specific toxicity of autoxidizable gluta-
thione S-conjugates results from the
capability of the proximal tubules to accu-
mulate and process these conjugates
(37,40). Conceivably, oxidative stress by
redox cycling and arylation of cellular
sulfhydryls (23,41) by the concentrated
quinoid compounds are the tubular cells'
doom. It remains to be established whether
glutathione S-conjugates of aminophenols
and phenylenediamines are also genotoxic
and contribute to renal carcinogenicity (40).
Mechanisms of the Reactions
of Nitrosoarenes with Thiols
The reactions of thiols with nitrosoarenes
are complex, and product formation is
dependent on thiol concentration, pH, and
substituent effects (42-45). With the
model thiol, 1-thioglycerol (46,47), we
could confirm the reversible formation of a
semimercaptallike intermediate, the exis-
tence of which had been supposed already

REACTIONS OF OXIDATIVELYACTIVATED ARYLAMINES WITH THIOLS
from kinetic measurements (43). Mean-
while, the semimercaptal of 4-nitrosonitro-
benzene and GSH also has been isolated
and characterized by NMR spectroscopy
(48). The transient semimercaptal can
react in several ways (Figure 7):
a) The intermediate loses the hydroxyl
group with formation of an N-(thiol-S-yl)-
arylamine cation that may be trapped by
reaction of a solvent water molecule at the
sulfur atom, giving rise to a sulfinamide
structure. This sequence has been con-
firmed with 080-tracer experiments
(47,49).
b) A second thiolate anion reacts at the
sulfur of the intermediate semimercaptal,
displacing the phenylhydroxylamine anion
with formation ofGSSG. This reaction has
been postulated repeatedly in agreement
with reaction kinetics and product pattern
(43,44,46,48,49). Until now, however, we
have had no definite prooffor this proposed
reaction mechanism (47).
It should be noted that formation of
phenylhydronitroxide radicals was detected
when nitrosobenzene was reacted with
GSH, and it has been hypothesized that
nitrosobenzene is reduced to the phenyl-
hydronitroxide radical with formation of
the thiyl radical (2,50). In fact, thiyl radical
formation was detected when low concen-
trations of nitrosobenzene (0.1 mM) were
mixed with 30 mM GSH in the presence
of 100 mM DMPO as spin trap (K Maples,
personal communication). These results,
however, cannot rule out definitively that
the phenylhydronitroxide radicals are
formed by comproportionation of
nitrosobenzene and phenylhydroxylamine
(51) and that thiyl radical formation occurs
during the reaction of the phenylhydroni-
troxide radical with GSH.
c) Formation of a sulfenamide, N-
(thiol-S-yl)-arylamine, was detected with 2-
nitrosofluorene and GSH (52), with
nitrosobenzene and 1-thioglycerol (46),
and with 4-nitrosophenetol and GSH (53,
54). Sulfenamide formation was proposed
initially to occur through a mercaptal inter-
mediate, ArN(SR)2, followed by thiolytic
cleavage (44). Such a reaction became less
probable later on, because reaction of
ArN(OH)SR with different thiols R'SH
did not yield ArNHSR' but always
ArNHSR (46). Kazanis et al. (49) in their
brilliant work offer an attractive explana-
tion for sulfenamide formation from the
N-(thiol-S-yl)-arylamine cation: nucleo-
philic addition to the ring, particularly
when it-donors are in para position, can
lead to a thioadduct incapable of aromati-

zation. This adduct can be cleaved thiolyti-
cally and forms the sulfenamide. The latter
can be cleaved thiolytically once more with
formation of the arylamine. In the reso-
nance-stabilized N-(thiol-S-yl)-arylamines
with strong t-donors, the positive charge is
highly delocalized to the ring carbon atoms
thereby facilitating other addition reac-
tions. We have isolated such products from
4-nitrosophenetol and GSH, 4-ethoxy-2-
(glutathione-S-yl)-aniline and a variety of
polycyclic compounds (47,54,55).
Investigation of substituent effects have
indicated clearly a Hammett correlation of
the reactivity and the product pattern ofp-
substituted nitrosoarenes in their reactions
with GSH (45,49,55). Thus, 4-nitrosoni-
trobenzene gives only the phenylhydroxyl-
amine via the semimercaptal (48). The
same holds true for another nitrosoarene
with strong electron-withdrawing groups-
4-nitrosoacetophenone (45). The interme-
diary nitrosobenzene gives phenylhydroxyl-
amine, the sulfinamide, and the sulfen-
amide. On the other end of the Hammett
scale, 4-nitrosophenetol and 4-nitroso-
N,N-dimethylaniline with their strong
donating substituents yield no phenyl-
hydroxylamine, but ultimately yield the
amine besides the other adducts mentioned
above (45,47,54,55).
Toxicologic Impacts of the
Reactions of Thiols with
Nitroso Compounds
Nitrosoimiudazoles
Nitroheterocyclic compounds like the
nitroimidazoles are used worldwide as
antimicrobial, antiparasitic, and radiosensi-
tizing agents. Metabolic activation, mainly
by nitro group reduction, seems to be a
prerequisite for the biologic effects (56).
The influence ofthiols, mainly GSH, on the
toxicity, mutagenicity, and DNA damage
has revealed complex mechanisms. The 2-
hydroxylaminoimidazoles apparently react
directly with thiols to form unstable 2-N-
(glutathione-S-yl) conjugates which in the
presence of excess GSH produce two stable
4-C- and 5-C-(glutathione-S-yl) conjugates,
possibly with a nitrenium ion as intermedi-
ate (57-60). These data indicate that thiols
may both activate and inactivate penulti-
mate reactive nitroimidazole compounds.
GSH and cysteine enhanced the incor-
poration of labeled 1-methyl-4-phenyl-5-
nitrosoimidazole into X-phage DNA and
polynucleotides (61). The authors con-
cluded that a semimercaptal-like intermedi-
ate might yield a highly reactive cation that
binds to DNA. These data suggest that the
nitrosoimidazole might still be a penultimate
reactive intermediate in the bioactivation of

nitroimidazoles, which by interaction with
thiols gives the ultimate reactive species
that binds to DNA.
1-Methyl-2-nitrosoimidazole was two
orders of magnitude more toxic to CHO
cells than the nitro and hydroxylamine
compound. Circumstantial evidence sug-
gested that GSH may reduce cytotoxicity
(62). Similar observations were reported
with HT-29 human colon cancer cells.
Depletion ofcellular GSH with buthionine
sulfoximine before incubation with the
nitrosoimidazole resulted in enhanced sus-
ceptibility (63). In chemical systems, 1-
methyl-2-nitrosoimidazole reacted rapidly
with GSH, with formation of GSSG, the
hydroxylamine, and imidazole-GSH
adducts. Mixtures of the nitrosoimidazole
with GSH gave rise to DNA strand breaks
in the plasmid assay (64). Since the DNA
damage by the nitrosoimidazole in HT-29
colon cancer cells probably was not a result
of a direct interaction of the nitroso com-
pound, a possible activating effect of GSH
to yield the ultimate electrophile (which is
not the hydroxylamine) was discussed (65).
All these hypotheses have to be confirmed,
but it appears that GSH might have an
ambiguous role in the reactions with
nitrosoimidazoles. Probably, steady state
concentrations of both the metastable
intermediates and GSH at sensitive targets
critically control activating and inactivating
reactions.
Heterocyclic Nitroso Compounds firom
Protein Pyrolysates
Sugimura and co-workers have found
numerous mutagenic compounds in
broiled fish and meat, and in pyrolysates of
protein and amino acids. These mutagens
are heterocyclic amines and exhibit muta-
genicity in the presence of S9 mix (66). All
these mutagens, derivatives of pyridoindole
(Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2), pyridoimidazole
(Glu-P-1 and Glu-P-2), and imidazoquino-
line (IQ) are N-hydroxylated at an exocyclic
amino group to form proximate reactive
compounds.
Thiols, particularly GSH, modify the
mutagenic activity and covalent binding to
DNA by at least two mechanisms. The first
one involves glutathione S-transferase,
which in the case of N-OH-Trp-P-2 pro-
duces a stable C-conjugate and two labile
N-conjugates, a sulfenamide and, to the
best ofour knowledge, a hitherto unidenti-
fied derivative that easily liberates the parent
N-OH-Trp-P-2. This last compound was
found to be outstandingly mutagenic
(67,68). The second pathway starts with
the nitroso derivative leading to the putative
semimercaptal-like intermediate (69), a
sulfenamide, and a sulfinamide (68). Most
interestingly, also a N-hydroxysulfonamide
from NO-Glu-P-1 was apparently formed
(70), which may have derived from reac-
tion of the (liberated) glutathione sulfinic
acid with NO-Glu-P-1. Such a reaction has
been reported to occur with nitrosoarenes
and arenesulfinic acids (71). A direct reac-
tion of nitroso compounds of interest with
authentic glutathione sulfinic acid under
physiologic conditions, however, remains
to be established. No reaction between N-
OH-Glu-P-1 and GSH was detected (70).
At present, it appears that the interaction of
GSH with the nitroso heterocyclic pyro-
lysates is mainly a detoxication reaction.
Nitrosoarenes
A chemical intermediate widely used in the
synthesis of certain dyes and explosives, m-
dinitrobenzene has been found to cause tes-
ticular toxicity, with the Sertoli cells being
the initial target. The toxicity is probably
mediated through m-nitrosonitrobenzene.
Depletion of cellular GSH with diethyl,-
maleate made the cultured rat Sertoli cells
more susceptible to damage by m-dini-
trobenzene and m-nitrosonitrobenzene,
while cysteamine reduced the toxicity.
These data suggest that GSH interferes
with metabolically formed reactive species,
probably by scavenging the nitrosoarene
(48,72).
2-Nitrosofluorene is a potent direct-act-
ing mutagen that is derived from bio-
transformation of the well-known
carcinogen N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (73).
The mutagenicity of 2-nitrosofluorene is
known to be inhibited by inclusion of
GSH in the assay media. Interestingly, the
reaction of 2-nitrosofluorene with GSH,
which yields a water-soluble product that
liberated 2-aminofluorene under acidic
conditions, is probably the first example of
this class of reactions reported in the litera-
ture (74). Later on, others have elucidated
the reactions more intensively (44, 52) and
found hydroxylamine, sulfinamide, and
sulfenamide formation. In addition, slow
formation of the sulfenamide fr-om the
interaction of N-hydroxy-2-aminofluorene
with GSH was reported, and a nucleophilic
displacement reaction was suggested to be
underlying (52). Because this reaction was
also observed in the presence of ascorbic
acid, interference of 2-nitrosofluorene via
autoxidation or disproportionation was
excluded. Conceivably, N-O cleavage is
facilitated by the stabilizing effect of the
phenyl residue that may act as a strong It-
donor (49). The resulting nitrenium ion
may then react with GSH to form the
sulfenamide. In fact, N-hydroxy-2-amino-
fluorene is quite electrophilic and reacts
readily with DNA and deoxyguanosine,
even at neutral pH (FF Kadlubar, personal
communication, 1984). 4-Nitrosophenetol
bound directly to tRNA (75) but only
weakly to calf thymus DNA, whereas N-
hydroxy-4-phenetidine bound readily (53).
GSH was without effect on binding of 4-
nitrosophenetol.
Studying toxic effects ofp-substituted
nitrosoarenes with widely varying
Hammett constants that induce cellular
damage in isolated rat hepatocytes, O'Brien
and co-workers detected dichotomic mod-
ulating effects ofGSH (41). GSH depletion
by diethylmaleate decreased cytotoxicity by
nitrosobenzene and 4-chloronitrosobenzene
but increased cytotoxicity with 4-
nitrosoacetophenone and 4-nitroso-N,N-
dimethylaniline. From these data, it was
concluded that those nitrosoarenes capable
of forming sulfinamides with GSH (45)
may produce particularly toxic intermedi-
ates (e.g., the sulfinamide itself) (76) or,
more likely, the electrophilic arylnitrenium
cations as proposed by McClelland's group
(49). Hence, these observations point to
mechanisms whereby GSH enhances toxicity.
The protective effect of GSH on 4-
nitrosoacetophenone toxicity might be a
result ofthe very rapid reduction rates with
formation ofthe hydroxylamine and GSSG
[k= 105 M-Isec l (45)]. A similar mecha-
nism in 4-nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline
toxicity is less likely, since the reaction with
GSH is sluggish [k= 1.5 M-1secG1 (45)]. In
this particular case, another detoxication
mechanism appears to act: conjugation
with GSH is brought about by hepatic glu-
tathione S-transferase (77).
A peculiar toxic action of nitrosoarenes
was observed during liver perfusion. 4-
Nitrosophenetol (78) and 4-nitroso-N,N-
dimethylaniline inhibited glutathione and
GSSG excretion into bile, while
nitrosobenzene and 4-nitrosoacetophenone
were inactive (3). Such an inhibition has
been observed also in erythrocytes, where
4-nitrosophenetol inhibited the export of
the model glutathione S-conjugate, S-(2,4-
dinitrophenyl)-glutathione, in a competi-
tive manner. The competition is probably
caused by glutathione S-conjugates of 4-
nitrosophenetol (55). 4-Nitrosophenetol
and the bicyclic derivative 4-ethoxy-4'-
nitrosodiphenylamine have been shown to
be cytotoxic to isolated rat hepatocytes
with GSH depletion (79).
The most obvious effects of GSH on
cytotoxicity of nitrosoarenes are observed
Environmental Health Perspectives128
REACTIONS OF OXIDATIVELYACTIVATED ARYLAMINES WITH THIOLS
in the blood. The methemoglobinemia and
hemolysis brought about by nitrosoarenes
in the Kiese cycle, where nitrosoarenes are
enzymically reduced and the phenylhy-
droxylamines are cooxidized to yield ferri-
hemoglobin and the parent nitrosoarene
(80-82), are markedly influenced by reac-
tions with thiols. GSH decreases the extent
of ferrihemoglobin formation and increases
the clearance of the blood from the
nitrosoarenes (3,83-86). Such an example
is shown in Figure 8, where GSH markedly
diminished ferrihemoglobin formation by
eliminating 4-nitrosophenetol from the
Kiese cycle.
The importance of the clearing function
of blood to protect other sensitive target
organs has been postulated earlier (84) and
confirmed in the case of nitrosochlor-
amphenicol. This bacterial metabolite of
chloramphenicol has been accused to pro-
duce the occasionally observed stem cell
damage (87). However, nitrosochloram-
phenicol reacts very rapidly with GSH in
chemical systems (88) and in the blood
(85), so that the reactive compound was
calculated to be degraded within a few sec-
onds. Hence, nitrosochloramphenicol,
formed by microorganisms in the intestine
or produced in the liver, will be degraded
in blood before it can reach the bone marrow
(85,89). Interestingly, another bacterial
chloramphenicol metabolite emerged as a
favorite proximate toxic candidate, dehydro-
chloramphenicol, a compound with a pro-
piophenone moiety (89) (Figure 9). This
compound is fairly stable in the blood and
can reach the bone marrow cells.
Dehydrochloramphenicol itself inhibits
myeloid colony growth. Perhaps the most
important aspect of dehydrochlorampheni-
col is that, in contrast to chloramphenicol,
it is readily reduced by human bone marrow
homogenate, even under aerobic condi-
tions (90). One can assume that the 4-
nitrosopropiophenone will react with GSH
similarly to 4-nitrosoacetophenone to give
the hydroxylamine and GSSG, thereby
inducing a marked oxidative stress. Further
investigations will show whether this meta-
bolic pathway is indeed responsible for the
chloramphenicol induced aplastic anemia.
A variety of arylamine drugs induce
idiosyncratic reactions like lupus erythema-
todes and agranulocytosis. Procainamide is
associated with a relatively high incidence of
both idiosyncrasies. It has been suggested
that myeloperoxidase-mediated reactions
might be involved. The hydroxylamine and
nitroso derivatives of procainamide were
produced by activated human neutrophiles
and in the presence of myeloperoxidase/
hydrogen peroxide. The nitroso compound
was found to react rapidly with thiols to
give a sulfinamide (91). In addition, cova-
lent binding to proteins was observed.
Such a reaction sequence, which produces a
hapten-macromolecule adduct, will ulti-
mately induce antibody formation and give
rise to an immune system-mediated idio-
syncratic drug reaction. Similar reactions
may be underlying other idiosyncrasies
observed with dapsone, sulfonamides,
metoclopramide, and p-aminosalicyclic
acid (92,93).
Finally, and notably, nitrosoarene reac-
tions with SH groups in human hemoglo-
bin are particularly worthy to mention
because of the genius loci. Neumann and
coworkers have undertaken many efforts
during the last decade to use hemoglobin
adducts as a dose monitor in exposure con-
trol of aromatic amines and their relation-
ship to risk assessment (44,94-96). The
method makes use ofsulfinamide formation
ofnitrosoarenes with the exposed SH group
of cysteine P93 in human hemoglobin.
These adducts are rather stable to provide
an integral dose monitor for the internal
exposure to and the extent of metabolic
activation ofaromatic amines. The phenyl-
hydroxylamines are cooxidized by oxyhe-
moglobin, and a fraction of the nitroso
compound can react with the hemoglobin
sulfhydryls. The precipitated hemoglobin
of washed red cells is hydrolyzed, and the
liberated amine is determined. This
method may also allow the identification of
persons with high individual risk (acetyla-
tor status, oxidative phenotype, G6PDH
deficiency). Of course, direct comparison of
the hemoglobin binding indices of various
aromatic amines (or nitroarenes) has to
consider the widely varying bioavailability
of the nitrosoarenes for binding, because
steric and substituent effects markedly
influence the yield of sulfinamide forma-
tion with hemoglobin SH groups (86,97),
topics that have already been discussed.
Conclusion
The study of the reactions of oxidatively
activated arylamines with thiols has
revealed a puzzling variety ofreaction types.
Some pathways lead to rather stable prod-
ucts that are excreted with urine or bile and
can be regarded as water-soluble, inactive
conjugates. Other pathways lead to metas-
table derivatives that can be reactivated in
particular target cells. Autoxidizable
thioethers are concentrated in the kidney;

labile thiol adducts of nitroso compounds
may liberate carbonium/nitrenium ions that
exhibit genotoxic activity. Covalent bind-
ing to proteins can inactivate vital enzymes
and may lead to haptenization, followed by
an immune response. Last, covalently
bound adducts to proteins can pose a latent
risk when the adducts are degraded, either
in the body or in processed food from ani-
mals that have been treated with antibiotics
(e.g., chloramphenicol, nitrofurans, or
nitroimidazoles) or from agricultural prod-
ucts contaminated with herbicides, insecti-
cides, etc. The rather new public interest in
the toxicity of (drug) residues bound cova-
lently to cysteine (98,99) will probably
help toxicologists remain employed well
into the future.
