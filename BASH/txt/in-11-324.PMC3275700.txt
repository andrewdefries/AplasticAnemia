The human leukocyte antigen (HLA), the major histocompati-
bility complex (MHC) in humans has been known to reside on
chromosome 6 and encodes cell-surface antigen-presenting
proteins and many other proteins related to immune system
function. The HLA is highly polymorphic and the most genet-
ically variable coding loci in humans. In addition to a critical
role in transplantation medicine, HLA and disease associa-
tions have been widely studied across the populations world-
wide and are found to be important in prediction of disease
susceptibility, resistance and of evolutionary maintenance of
genetic diversity. Because recently developed molecular
based HLA typing has several advantages like improved
specimen stability and increased resolution of HLA types,
the association between HLA alleles and a given disease
could be more accurately quantified. Here, in this review, we
have collected HLA association data on some autoimmune
diseases, infectious diseases, cancers, drug responsiveness
and other diseases with unknown etiology in Koreans and at-
tempt to summarize some remarkable HLA alleles related
with specific diseases.

INTRODUCTION
For more than 30 years since the first report on the associa-
tion of a disease with a specific HLA (human leukocyte anti-
gen) gene, such association studies have been performed for
more than 500 different diseases (1). One of reasons to study
gene association is to define disease-specific susceptibility
and protective markers for immunogenetic profiling, risk as-
sessment and therapeutic decisions (2). Although not all in-
dividuals with susceptibility alleles will develop the disease
and not all disease individuals have the high risk alleles, most
diseases showing HLA association suggested the pathogenesis
related with immune system and majority of them are re-
garded as autoimmune diseases (3). Diseases with a strong
association with certain specific HLA class I or class II genes
include type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing
spondylitis, and allergic diseases. Recently, infectious dis-
eases, cancers and drug-induced adverse effects are also asso-
ciated with increased susceptibility with HLA.
The understanding on MHC restriction of cellular immune
response provided to speculate the evolutionary maintenance
of the genetic diversity of HLA types, presumably through the
ability to present more peptide epitopes to T lymphocytes.
Particular HLA types might present more peptide epitopes for
a given virus. Heterozygous HLA might have more chance
to protection than homozygous. The diseases associated with
HLA class I alleles may involve cytotoxic T lymphocytes
whereas those associated with HLA class II may involve T
helper or suppressor lymphocytes. Studies of polymorphic
microsatellite markers have suggested the other HLA-linked
genes influencing disease susceptibility and/or resistance
within HLA region. HLA-linked genes such as LMP (low mo-
lecular weight proteasome), TAP (transporter associated with
antigen processing), HLA-DM (non-classical class II product)
and TNF (tumor necrosis factor) are also likely to be under
the influence of linkage disequilibrium with the classical HLA
genes (4).
Different populations tend to show different distributions
of alleles and extended haplotypes. Concordant results be-
tween studies of different ethnic groups increase the possi-

bility of HLA association, whereas discordant result may mean
that the associated HLA allele is weakly associated with a par-
ticular disease and that the different ethnic groups don’t have
proper distribution of HLA alleles to demonstrate disease sus-
ceptibility (5). A population analysis and comparison among
different racial and ethnic groups are needed to make these
genetic interactions more informative (6).
In this review, we have summarized reports on HLA and
disease association in Koreans, which were searched from
PubMed and KoreaMed with the keywords HLA, associations
and Korea (or Korean, or Koreans) among papers published
from 1990 to 2011 September.
RHEUMATOLOGIC DISEASES (Table I)
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)
RA is a condition in which complex inflammation occurs
within the joint causing erosion and destruction of articular
components. RA is a polygenic disease with both environ-
mental and genetic factors which, when combined, result in
the disease process and its clinical outcome. It has been sug-
gested that RA is associated with genes which lie within the
HLA complex. This region contains many genes that encode
proteins, which play an important role in the initiation and
regulation of immune response. In initial reports of an associ-
ation of DRB1*04 with RA, certain DR and DQ alleles have
proved to interact with RA. These reports suggested that the
DR/DQ region might be more important than any other part
of the HLA region in terms of defining the development of
the mechanisms of RA. In Korean population, the frequency
of DR4 in RA patients was significantly greater than that in con-
trols and DR6 was decreased. HLA-DRB1*0401, DRB1*0405,
DQA1*03, DQB1*04 was positively associated with RA (7-9).
Haplotype DRB1* 0405-DQA1*03-DQCAR113-DQB1*03 hap-
lotype showed highest relative risk value (7).
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
SLE is an autoimmune disease characterized by immune dys-
regulation, leading to high levels of autoantibody production,
immune complex deposition and tissue injury. HLA genes
have received significant attention in human SLE, and there
is evidence supporting a role for specific extended HLA hap-
lotypes as genetic risk factors for disease expression in sev-
eral populations. HLA-DR2 and DR9 have shown consistent
associations with SLE in European Caucasian populations
(10). In Koreans, DR9 and DRB1*1501 showed positive asso-
ciation with SLE (10,11).
Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
AS is a chronic inflammatory disease of the axial skeleton
with variable involvement of peripheral joints and non-
articular structures. HLA-B27 is strongly associated with AS
and its subtypes differ in their ethnic distribution. Studies
worldwide have shown that B*2701, B*2702, B*2704, B*2705,
B*2707, B*2708, B*2714, B*2715, and B*2719 are AS-predis-
posing subtypes (12). In Koreans, a study showed that B27
(96.3%) is strongly associated with AS and the major subtype
of B27 in patients with AS is B*2705 (92.2%) (12).
Adult Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD)
AOSD is a rare form of inflammatory arthritis that was charac-
terized by Bywaters EG in 1971 and the underlying cause is
unknown. Some studies have suggested that Korean AOSD
patients have distinct immunogenetic profiles. It would be
valuable to assess the relationships between HLA-DRB1 genes
and polymorphisms of proinflammatory cytokines to define

the pathogenesis of AOSD. In Korean population, patients
with AOSD had more frequent DRB1*12 and DRB1*15 and
less frequent DRB1*04 compared to controls (13).
Systemic Sclerosis (SSc)
SSc is a multisystem connective tissue disease of unknown
etiology that is thought to have an autoimmune origin. Recent
investigations on the immunogenetic background of the dis-
ease have shown that HLA class II alleles are associated with
the disease. SSc patients with anti-topo I have been shown
to have distinct associations with HLA-DR or DQ alleles.
HLA-DRB1*1104 in Caucasians and DRB1*1502 in Japanese
were found to be associated with anti-topo I positive SSc. In
Korean population, two studies showed that DRB1*1502,
DPB1*0901 and DPB1*1301 were significantly associated with
SSc (14,15).
Behcet’s Disease (BD)
BD is s a rare immune-mediated systemic vasculitis that often
presents with mucous membrane ulceration and ocular
involvements. The HLA-B51 allele is known to be associated
with BD in many ethnic groups. However, it has not yet been
clarified whether the B51 gene itself is the pathogenic gene
related to BD or whether it is some other gene in linkage
disequlibrium with B51. A study aimed to investigate the as-
sociation of B51 with BD showed the prevalence of B51 was
significantly increased in Korean patients with BD (16).
ENDOCRINE DISEASES (Table II)
Autoimmue Thyroid Disease (AITD)
AITD are organ-specific autoimmune disorders caused by thy-
roid autoantibodies, which result in thyroid dysfunction. The
mechanism underlying the pathogenesis is unclear, but AITD
may occur when genetically susceptible individuals are ex-
posed to environmental modulating triggers such as infection,
iodine, and stress. Tissue infiltration of the thyroid gland by
thyroid autoantibodies that mediate humoral immune re-
actions causes hyperthyroidism in Graves’ disease (GD) and
hypothyroidism in Hashimoto’s disease (HD). The fact that
GD and HD are observed commonly in the same family tree
may reflect a similar genetic basis between the two diseases.
The HLA alleles associated with GD are reported to be vari-
able in different ethnic groups. In Caucasian, HLA-B8, DR3
by serotyping and DRB1*0301, DRB3*0101, DQA1*0501,
DQB1*0201 by genotyping were associated with genetic sus-
ceptibility to GD. Also, Many Japanese studies showed that
HLA-A2, B35, B46, Cw11, DR5, DR8 by serotyping and HLA-
DPB1*0501, DRB1*0803, DRB1*1403, DQA1*0103 by genotyp-
ing were associated with GD. In Hong Kong Chinese, HLA-
B46, DR9, and DQB1*0303 were found to be associated with
GD. Recently, HLA-B46, DR2, DR9, DR53, DQw1, and
DRB1*0901 were related to GD in Singapore and Taiwan, re-
spectively (17,18).
Early onset AITD had more frequent HLA-B46 and Cw*01
in Koreans (17). DRB1*030101, DRB1*080201, DRB1*0803,
DRB1*140301 and DRB1*1602 were associated with GD and
DRB1*0803-DQB1*0601 and DRB1*1602-DQB1*0502 haploty-
pes were also associated with GD (18,19). Also, The fre-
quency of DR8 and DQB1*0302 was increased in patients
with thyrotropin receptor-blocking antibody-positive atrophic
autoimmune thyroiditis (20).
Insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM)
IDDM is an autoimmune disease resulting from the selective
destruction of insulin-producing islet cells in the pancreas.
The precise etiology of IDDM is not well understood. Recent
gene mapping studies have indicated that a large number of
genes contribute to the genetic susceptibility to IDDM and the

HLA class II region encodes the most important genetic fac-
tors in IDDM. In most Caucasian populations, the HLA region
may explain a large proportion, but less than 50%, of the total
familial aggregation of the disease. The HLA-DRB1*0405-DQA1*
0302-DQB1*0401 haplotype is known to be the main suscep-
tible haplotype in Japanese IDDM. The most common allele
DQCAR 113 and HLA-DRB1*0405-DQA1*0302-DQCAR113-
DQB1*0401 haplotype were increased in Japanese IDDM pa-
tients compared with normal controls (21).
In Korean population, the frequencies of HLA-DRB1*0301,
DRB1*0407, DRB1*0901 and DQB1*0201 were significantly in-
creased in IDDM patients and DRB1*0401-DQB*0302 and
DRB1*0405-DQB1*0302 haplotypes were significantly asso-
ciated with IDDM (22).
DERMATOLOGIC & ALLERGIC DISEASES (Table III)
Psoriasis
Psoriatic lesions are characterized by epidermal hyperplasia
and the presence of acute and chronic inflammatory cells.
Activated lymphocytes, other immune accessory cells and
lymphokines have also been detected in psoriatic plaques.
Epidemiologic studies, including concordance rates in twin
pairs and siblings suggest that genetic factors are strongly in-
volved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Psoriasis has been
reported to be significantly associated with the HLA-A1, A2,
A30, B13, B17, B37, B39, B46, Cw6, Cw7, Cw9, Cw11, DR7,
and DQA1*0201 (23). This relationship, however, tends to vary
between patients of different racial and ethnic backgrounds.
In Koreans, Cw*0602 showed the strongest association with
psoriasis. The frequencies of A1, A30, B13, B37, DRB1*07,
DRB1*10, DQA1*02, DQB1*02 and DPB1*1701 were signifi-
cantly increased in patients with psoriasis (23). A1-B37-Cw*
0602-DRB1*10-DQA1*01-DQB1*05, A30-B13-Cw*0602-DRB1*07-
DQA1*02-DQB1*02, and A30-B13-Cw*0602-DRB1*07-DQA1*02-
DQB1*02-DPB1*1701 haplotypes showed significant associa-
tion with psoriasis (23).
Atopic Dermatitis
Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory, chronically relapsing,
non-contagious and pruritic skin disorder and has been seen
to result from multifactorial inheritance, with interaction be-
tween genetic and environmental factors. But, the genetic as-
sociation may differ according to the ethnic backgrounds. In
Koreans, a study showed the frequency of HLA-A24 was sig-
nificantly increased in patients with atopic dermatitis com-
pared to controls (24).
Specific IgE Responses to House Dust Mite (D. pteronys-
sinus)
The allergic reaction occurs when the immune system mis-
interprets a usually innocuous substance as a disease agent
and produces a type of antibody against it, called immuno-
globulin E (IgE). House dust mites are a common cause of
asthma and allergic symptoms worldwide. So, IgE responses
to house dust mite-derived allergens seem to be the most im-
portant in the development of atopic asthma and rhinitis, but
it has been difficult to demonstrate genetic control of the IgE
response to the allergens. In this backgrounds, two studies
showed that HLA-DRB1*07 was significantly higher in subjects
with high serum-specific IgE response to crude house dust
mite allergens than the controls (25,26).

Asthma
Aspirin (ASA)-intolerant asthma (AIA) affecting 10% to 20%
of adults with asthma is characterized by ASA hypersensiti-
vity, bronchial asthma, and chronic rhino sinusitis with nasal
polyposis. Although the pathogenic mechanism is not fully
understood, a possible involvement of immunologic mecha-
nisms in association with HLA alleles, particularly HLA-
DPB1*0401 and DPB1*0301 was suggested in a white pop-
ulation with AIA. However, these data have focused on
whites and are required to be confirmed in other ethnic
populations. In Korean population, the frequency of DPB1*
0301 was significantly increased in AIA patients (27). There
was other type of asthma, toluene diisocyanate (TDI)-induced
occupational asthma (TDI-OA). The TDI-OA is incompletely
understood and several studies have suggested immunologic
mechanisms, including specific IgE responses. A few studies
have suggested HLA associations with TDI-induced asthma in
Western countries. The first investigation of associations be-
tween HLA class I and II alleles and TDI-induced asthma pa-
tients in Korean population was performed. The DRB1*1501-
DQB1*0602-DPB1*0501 haplotype was significantly higher in
TDI-OA patients than in unexposed normal controls (28).
INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND CANCERS (Table IV)
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection
Chronic hepatitis B infection is the leading cause of cirrhosis
and hepatocellular carcinoma. Some studies have suggested
that HLA may be involved in the chronicity of HBV infection.
In Korean population, hepatitis B chronicity was positively as-
sociated with HLA-A33 and -DR7. The significant haplotypes
were A33-DR7, B44-DR7 and A33-B44-DR7 in Koreans (29).
HBV-Glomerulonephritis (GN)
HBV-GN is occurring at high prevalence in most Asian en-
demic areas. There have been some reports on HLA associa-
tions with HBV infections; however, HLA association with
HBV-GN has been rarely reported. In these backgrounds,
some results were presented that a strong association with
HLA-DR2 and DQB1*0601 was observed in HBV-GN patients,
compared with HBsAg(－) controls. Different DR2 alleles
were associated with different pathologic subtypes of
HBV-GN: DRB1*1501 with membranous nephropathy (MN)
and DRB1*1502 with membranoproliferative glomeruloneph-
ritis (MPGN) (30).
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection
Hepatitis C is an infectious disease primarily affecting the liv-
er, caused by the HCV. The infection is often asymptomatic,
but chronic infection can lead to scarring of the liver and ulti-
mately to cirrhosis, which is generally apparent after many
years. Recent data have shown that the clinical outcome of
HCV infection may be influenced by the host genetic factor,
especially HLA. In Koreans, the frequencies of HLA-A3, B35
and B46 were significantly increased in chronic HCV carriers
compared with the controls (31). The DRB1*0803-DQB1*0601
haplotype was positively associated and DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201
was negatively associated with chronic HCV carrier (31).

Pulmonary Tuberculosis
It is estimated that approximately one third of the world’s
population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. An
interesting feature of mycobacterial infection is that only 10%
of persons infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis develop
clinical tuberculosis (TB), indicating the existence of host ge-
netic factors regulating disease expression. As one of the host
genetic factors, associations of HLA with susceptibility to TB
have been studied in many ethnic groups. In Korean pop-
ulation, the frequencies of DRB1*0803 and DQB1*0601 were
significantly increased in TB patients (32). These alleles were
associated with disease progression of TB, exerting influence
on the development of drug resistance, severe disease, and
recurrent disease (32).
Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Lung Disease
The incidence of pulmonary disease caused by nontuber-
culous mycobacteria (NTM) in human immunodeficiency vi-
rus (HIV)- negative patients is increasing worldwide. NTM are
ubiquitous environmental organisms. As exposure to these or-
ganisms is universal and the occurrence of the disease is rare,
normal host-defense mechanisms in most cases appear to be
sufficiently effective in preventing infection. Previous studies
have revealed that NTM lung disease is associated with specif-
ic HLA alleles in the Japanese population. And a recent study
showed patients with NTM lung disease showed an increased
frequency of HLA-DRB1*11 in Korean population (33).
Gastric Carcinoma
Gastric carcinogenesis is a multi-step process and is influ-
enced by several etiological agents, including the host’s ge-
netic factors. Since whether a patient remains with chronic
superficial gastritis (CSG) or progresses to either chronic atro-
phic gastritis (CAG) or gastric carcinoma (GC) could be a ge-
netic predisposition unique in each population, HLA alleles
could be discriminative in predicting the risk of CSG pro-
gression to precancerous CAG and GC in Koreans. In a study
aimed to investigate the association of HLA class II allele with
GC progression, GC was very strongly associated with
HLA-DRB1*0404 in Korean population (34).
Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL)
Lymphoid malignancies are neoplasms that arise from B or
T cells that are at various stages of normal lymphocyte
development. The MHC has been extensively studied and
many of its associations with HLA been reported. Hodgkin’s
disease was the first disease defined to be associated with
HLA system. But, these studies have shown different results,
according to the ethnicity. In Koreans, HLA-B51, DRB1*09,
DQB1*03 and B51-DRB1*09- DQB1*03 haplotype were pos-
itively associated with NHL (35).
DRUG-INDUCED ADVERSE EFFECTS (Table V)
Carbamazepine-induced Severe Cutaneous Adverse
Reactions (SCARs)
Carbamazepine (CBZ), which is widely used to treat seizure
disorders, bipolar disorder, trigeminal neuralgia, and chronic
pain, is one of most common causes of drug hypersensitivity
reactions. It occasionally causes a severe cutaneous adverse
reactions (SCARs), such as hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS),
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis
(TEN). The US FDA recommends screening for HLA-B*1502 al-
lele in most of Asian ancestry before initiating carbamazepine
therapy. In this background, recent result in Korean pop-
ulation showed that the frequencies of A*3101 in CBZ-in-
duced HSS/SCARs were significantly higher than those in
CBZ-tolerant controls (35). The frequencies of A*3101 in
CBZ-induced HSS/SCARs and B*1511 in carbamazepine-in-
duced SJS were significantly higher than those in the general
population (36).
Methazolamide-induced SJS & TEN
The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor methazolamide infrequently
causes Stevens- Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal
necrolsis (TEN). An association between these diseases and

a study aimed to investigate disease-associated B59 and other
HLA class I alleles, the frequencies of B*5901 and Cw*0102
were very significantly increased with methazolamide-induced
SJS & TEN (37).
Allopurinol-induced SCARs
Allopurinol is a drug used primarily to treat hyperuricemia
and its complications, including chronic gout. Recent inves-
tigations suggest genetic susceptibility of allopurinol-induced
severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs). However, the
strength of association was variable according to phenotypes
and ethnic backgrounds. The frequencies of HLA-A*3303,
B*5801 and Cw*0302 were significantly higher in allopur-
inol-induced SCARs compared with tolerant controls (38).
MISCELLANEOUS DISEASES (Table VI)
Sudden Hearing Loss
Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is a partial or com-
plete, typically unilateral hearing loss characterized by a rap-
idity of onset or a progression that may occur within a few
HLA and Disease Associations in Koreans

moments or for a few days. Sudden SNHL has numerous pos-
sible causes, including viral infection, vascular occlusion,
cochlear membrane breaks, ototoxic drugs, and bacterial
infection. Autoimmunity or immunologic disorders have been
suggested as possible causes of idiopathic progressive SNHL;
however, the role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis has
not been studied. In two studies aimed to define the associa-
tion of HLA class II alleles with the susceptibility to SNHL
and with the results of corticosteroid treatment, the frequen-
cies of HLA-DRB1*04, DRB1*14, DQA1*03 and DQA1*05 were
significantly increased but, those of DQA1*01 and DQB1*06
were significantly decreased in the group nonresponsive to
corticosteroid therapy, compared with the controls (39,40).
The co-existence of DQA1*03 and DQA1*05 had highest fre-
quency in this nonresponsive group (39).
Meniere’s Disease (MD)
There have been succeeding reports concerning the auto-
immunity and circulating immune complexes involved in the
pathogenesis of MD. Several autoantigens have been sug-
gested in the pathogenesis of autoimmune inner ear diseases,
one being type 2 collagen (CII). Elevated levels of anti-CII
antibodies have been documented in patients with MD. As
to the pathogenesis of the disease, MD patients occasionally
have a positive family history, suggesting some genetic pre-
disposing factors involved in the disease. A few studies have
shown HLA associations with MD and other autoimmune in-
ner ear diseases with variable results. HLA-A1, B8, Cw7 or
DR4 were increased in Caucasian patients and DR2
(DRB1*1602) was increased in Japanese patients with MD. In
Koreans, two studies aimed to investigate HLA-associated ge-
netic susceptibility to MD in relation to CII showed that the
frequencies of Cw*0303 and Cw*0602 were significantly in-
creased and the frequencies of B44, Cw*0102 were sig-
nificantly decreased compared to controls (41). When the as-
sociation between hearing level and the presence of partic-
ular HLA alleles was evaluated, the frequencies of B13, B39,
Cw*0303 and Cw*0602 were significantly increased and those
of B44 and C*0102 were significantly decreased in MD pa-
tients with hearing losses (stages II-IV) (41). In the anti-CII
positive subgroup of MD patients, the frequency of
DRB1*0405 was significantly increased and in the anti-CII
negative patients, DRB1*1201 was increased and DRB1*13
was decreased compared to controls (42).
Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) Syndrome
VKH syndrome is a systemic disorder characterized by depig-
mentary inflammation of melanocyte-containing tissues and
usually causes bilateral diffuse granulomatous uveitis, alope-
cia, vitiligo, poliosis, tinnitus, dysacousia, and meningeal
symptoms. The exact cause of the syndrome is uncertain, but
the roles of autoimmune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of
the syndrome have been well known. One of the important
characteristics of the disease is its association with HLA. The
association of HLA-DR1, DR4, DR53, DQ4 antigens and
DRB1*04, DQA1, DQB1 subtypes with VKH syndrome has
been documented in Japanese, Brazilian, Hispanic, and
Chinese patients. HLA typing was performed in 18 Korean
patients with VKH syndrome (43). The frequencies of A31,
B55, DRB1*0405, DQA1*0302, DQB1*0401 and DPB1*0501
were significantly increased in the patients group compared
with the control group. DRB1*04 showed strongest associa-
tion with VKH syndrome (43).
Takayasu Arteritis (TA)
TA occurs with a strong predilection for women and partic-
ular geographic areas, and as related to the etiology of the
disease, association of HLA antigens has been suggested.
Two studies showed that the frequencies of HLA-A*3001,
B*5201, Bw*52, Cw*6, DR7, DRB1*1502, DQw*2, and A*2402-
B*5201-DRB1*1502 haplotype were significantly higher in TA
patients and the frequency of A*2602 was significantly lower
in TA patients compared with controls (44,45). Further,
among the serious complication of TA, congestive heart fail-
ure was found to be positively associated with B*5201 (44).
Kawasaki Disease
Kawasaki disease is a leading cause of acquired heart disease
in children. The prevalence rate varies in different ethnic
groups. In a study aimed to assess the association of HLA
alleles with susceptibility and complications of Kawasaki dis-
ease in Korean children, there was a significant increase in
the frequencies of the HLA-B35, B75 and Cw*09 alleles in pa-
tients with Kawasaki disease compared with the healthy con-
trol group. And Kawasaki disease patients with coronary ar-
tery complications showed a significantly increased frequency
of DRB1*11 (46).
Moyamoya Disease. Moyamoya disease is characterized by
progressive cerebrovascular occlusion at the peripheral in-
ternal carotid artery and development of abnormal collateral
circulation at the cerebral basal region. Although abnormal
thrombogenesis, inflammation and autoimmune process
might be involved in the etiology, the genetic pathogenesis
of Moyamoya disease is still unknown. The frequency of
HLA-B35 allele was significantly increased in the patients
compared to the controls (47).

Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (IPAH)
PAH is a clinically heterogeneous entity, which is associated
with immune system dysfunction, including autoimmune dis-
eases and HIV infection. IPAH is a rare disease in which con-
sistently increased pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary
vascular resistance of unknown cause lead to right heart fail-
ure and death. Alterations in the frequency of HLA class II
alleles usually accompany autoimmune diseases. Increases in
the frequency of the HLA-DR3, DRw52, and DQw2 alleles
have been detected in children with IPAH. In addition, DRw52
was found to be more common in adult patients with pulmo-
nary hypertension and scleroderma than in controls and the
frequency of DQ7 was elevated in both adult and adolescent
patients with IPAH. The frequency of DRB1 and DQB1 alleles
in Korean patients with IPAH was studied to determine any
association that may exist between clinical characteristics of
IPAH and specific HLA alleles. The patients with IPAH had
a significantly higher frequency of the DRB1*0406, DQB1*
0302, and DRB1*0406-DQB1*0302 haplotype (48).
Diffuse Panbronchiolitis (DPB)
DPB is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of unknown
etiology. Observations of significantly increased frequency of
HLA-B54 in Japanese patients and occurrence of familial cases
suggest possible genetic predisposition to the disease
susceptibility. In Koreans, the frequencies of A11 and B55
were significantly increased with DPB (49).
Ulcerative colitis (UC)
UC is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although
dietary modification may reduce the discomfort of a person
with the disease, ulcerative colitis is not thought to be caused
by dietary factors. Ulcerative colitis is treated as an auto-
immune disease. Several studies have documented the high
incidence of several HLA class II alleles in Japanese patients
with UC. In Korean population, a study showed that HLA-DR2
and DRB1*1502 were found more frequently in patients than
controls (50).
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)
PCOS is one of the most common female endocrine disorders
and is a complex, heterogeneous disorder of uncertain
etiology. But, there is strong evidence that it can to a large
degree be classified as a genetic disease. Although several
studies have demonstrated the genetic contribution to PCOS,
the cause of this syndrome remains unclear. In a study aimed
to elucidate the relationship between HLA systems and PCOS
in Koreans and to investigate the association of HLA with
free-testosterone level, HLA-A11, A31 and B54 were positively
associated with phenotype frequencies in PCOS women com-
pared to controls (51).
Endometriosis
Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue
outside the uterus, causing diverse diseases, including in-
fertility, pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and constipation. While
there is a growing body of evidence that genetic and im-
munologic factors play important roles in the pathogenesis of
the disease, HLA have been reported to be associated with
the risk of endometriosis in the Japanese population. The
findings of the two studies in Koreans suggested that the sus-
ceptibility to endometriosis, unlike in the Japanese pop-
ulation, is not associated with HLA-A, B and DRB1 antigens
in the Korean population (52,53).
Aplastic Anemia (AA)
AA is a condition where bone marrow does not produce suffi-
cient new cells to replenish blood cells. In many cases, the
etiology is considered to be unknown but one known cause
is an autoimmune disorder in which white blood cells attack
the bone marrow. Also, HLA-DR15 is overrepresented in
aplastic anemia patients, and its presence is associated with
a better response to cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive
therapy. However, little is known about other HLA alleles af-
fecting therapy response. In this situation, a recent study in
Koreans showed that in responders, the frequency of DR4
was significantly lower and that of DR 15 was significantly
higher than in nonresponders (54).
Bipolar disorder
Many studies have been dedicated to determining the genetic
predispositions for bipolar disorder and the possible candi-
date genes for this disorder have been presumed to be lo-
cated in three specific chromosome regions: (i) the end of
short arm of chromosome 11; (ii) the long arm of the X chro-
mosome; and (iii) HLA complex on chromosome 6. Of these
three candidates, HLA has drawn major interest as a bio-
logical marker for bipolar disorder, which has led to a rapid
expansion in the number of investigations into the association
of HLA with bipolar disorder. However, previous reports on
the association of HLA with bipolar disorder have been
inconsistent. In a study aimed to elucidate an association be-
tween HLA alleles and bipolar disorder, the potentiality of
HLA was evaluated as a genetic marker in bipolar disorder.
Bipolar patients showed statistically significantly increased al-
lele frequencies of HLA-A29 and B54 and decreased allele fre-
quencies of B51 and DRB1*02 (55).

Narcolepsy
The sleep disorder narcolepsy is characterized by excessive
daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (sudden episodes of loss of
muscle tone triggered by emotions), and rapid transitions into
rapid eye movement sleep. Recent studies have shown that
the human disorder is caused by the destruction of most of
approximately 70,000 hypothalamic neurons that secrete a
wake-promoting neuropeptide called hypocretin. Measuring
hypocretin-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients is now an
accepted diagnostic test, with low levels indicating narcole-
psy. Based on the observations of the HLA association in the
disorder, an autoimmune-mediated destruction of hypo-
cretin-containing cells has been proposed as the cause of
most human cases. The association of narcolepsy with HLA-
DQB1*0602 is established in Japanese, African-Americans,
European, and North American Caucasians. Also, HLA-DRB1,
DRB3, DRB4, DRB5, DQA1, and DQB1 in Korean population
showed significantly increased frequency of DRB1*1501,
DQB1*0602 and decreased frequency of DQB1*0601 (56,57).
CONCLUSIONS
Genetic and genomic analysis of complex diseases will play
an important role in identification of new molecular targets
for intervention with pharmaceutical and biological drugs.
They would be helpful in prediction of the likely effectiveness
of particular therapies according to genotypes of individuals.
The HLA associations are clinically used for diagnosis, prog-
nosis and prophylaxis in a few of the diseases and some asso-
ciation studies provided to clarify disease heterogeneity (1).
However, we could also find the different HLA association
data according to population in some diseases. Several envi-
ronmental factors explain at least part of the excess risk and
differences in genetic constitution could affect disease suscep-
tibility. There is a need to create larger databases, including
cohorts in Korean population in addition to different eth-
nicities, more rigorous molecular typing, excellent longitudi-
nal data, appropriate statistical analysis and plausible bio-
logical associations. Immunogenetic profiling of patients with
large genetic variations including HLA is likely to realize the
personalized medicine in future (58).
