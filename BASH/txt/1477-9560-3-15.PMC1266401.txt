Abstract
Circulating procoagulant microparticles (MP) are pathogenic markers of enhanced coagulability
associated to a variety of disorders and released from stimulated vascular cells. When derived from
endothelial cells, MP were found characteristic of thrombotic propensity in primary
antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The prothrombotic status of a patient with antiphospholipid
antibodies (APL), a past history of mesenteric vein thrombosis and presenting myocardial infarction
and extensive intracardiac thrombosis was examined by measurement of circulating procoagulant
MP. MP of platelet and endothelial origins were highly elevated with respect to values detectable
in patients with myocardial infarction and no history of APS (6- and 3-fold elevation, respectively)
or in healthy volunteers (13- and 25-fold elevation, respectively). In this particular patient, with
moderate APL titer, a drastic release of procoagulant MP could have contributed to thrombus
growth and the development of extensive intracardiac thrombosis.
Introduction
In primary anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS), arterial or
venous thrombosis and recurrent pregnancy loss are com-
mon thrombotic manifestations associated with anti-pho-
phospholipid antibodies (APL) [1]. A variety of cardiac
affections including valvular lesions, myocardial dysfunc-
tion or infarction, early bypass graft failure, and intracar-
diac thrombosis have been reported [2-4]. Yet in vitro, APL
inhibit phospholipid-dependent blood coagulation and
bind to membrane phospholipids exposed by stimulated
or apoptotic cells [5]. Furthermore, in the presence of APL,
vascular cells are stimulated and acquire procoagulant,
proadhesive and proinflammatory phenotypes [1,6]. Two
non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain
the thrombotic propensity in APS (i) APL could impede
the natural anticoagulant protein C pathway, also involv-
ing anionic phospholipids (ii) APL would promote sus-
tained cell activation through the interaction of immune
complexes with vascular cells [1,7].

Procoagulant microparticles (MP) are shed from the
plasma membrane of any stimulated or apoptotic cells
[8,9]. Under most physiopathological conditions among
which acute myocardial syndrome, circulating MP, are
mainly of platelet origin [10,11] and can be viewed as a
"storage pool" by themselves, disseminating procoagu-
lant activities [9,12]. In blood flow, released MP contrib-
ute to thrombotic propensity by virtue of exposed anionic
phospholipids enhancing the catalytic surface available
for blood coagulation. In addition, harbored membrane
glycoproteins or antigens cytoadhesins, and proinflam-
matory lipids confer to MP the potency of cellular effec-
tors through multiple amplification loops [13].
Elevated levels of circulating MP were detected in various
diseases, a proportion of them associated with thrombotic
disorders [6,8,14-18]. In a particular patient with a past
history of mesenteric vein thrombosis and moderate titers
of anti-phospholipid antibodies referring for acute myo-
cardial infarction, we hypothesized that APL could have
prompted chronic cell stimulation and persisting MP
shedding, leading to enhanced thrombin generation pos-
sibly accounting for unusual extensive intracardiac
thrombi. Circulating levels of procoagulant MP were
measured and their cellular origin determined at distance
of the acute event. Values were compared to those of com-
parable patients presenting myocardial infarction but no
history of APS.
Case report patients treatments and methods
The patient was a 42-year-old man presenting acute myo-
cardial infarction (STEMI). The year before, he had devel-
oped mesenteric ischemia due to mesenteric vein
thrombosis and anticoagulant anti-phospholipid anti-
bodies were evidenced. He was treated by sigmoïdectomy.
No treatment by vitamin K antagonist was initiated fol-
lowing the former episode of mesenteric vein thrombosis.
Nine patients with STEMI and no past history of APS con-
stituted a reference group. In this control subset, the
absence of circulating APL (<10 GPL/ml) was verified on
one single occasion.
All patients received the same treatment namely, percuta-
neous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), stent
implantation, anti-platelet and anti-thrombin drugs
(clopidogrel, aspirin, abciximab and low molecular
weight or unfractionned heparin). Fifty healthy volun-
teers (HV) were simultaneously investigated. Investiga-
tions were approved by the local Ethic Committee.
Isolation of circulating MP and determination of
their procoagulant potential
Blood samples were collected on 12.9 mM tri-sodium cit-
rate. Platelet-poor plasma (PPP) samples containing cir-
culating MP were obtained by double centrifugation as
previously described [17-19]. Procoagulant MP were cap-
tured onto insolubilized annexin V and their PhtdSer con-
tent was measured by functional prothrombinase assay
using a microplate reader equipped with kinetics software.
In this assay, blood clotting factor (FXa, FVa, FII) and cal-
cium concentrations were determined to ensure that Phtd-
Ser is the rate-limiting parameter in the generation of
soluble thrombin from prothrombin. FVa was in excess
with respect to FXa in order to exclude any contribution of
FVa, possibly associated with MP. Results were expressed
as PhtdSer equivalent (PhtdSer Eq.) by reference to a
standard curve constructed with liposomes of known
PhtdSer concentrations. This purified system does not
allow the capture of lipoproteins, and the eventual pres-
ence of TF on captured MP does not alter values corre-
sponding to PhtdSer content, as it is based on a true
prothrombinase assay [19].
Search for the cellular origin of circulating MP
Biotinylated monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD31 mainly
for endothelial cells, anti-GPIb for platelets), were insolu-
bilized onto streptavidin-coated microtitration plates and
incubated with PPP. After washing, captured procoagu-
lant MP were quantified by prothrombinase assay as
described above. Background values obtained with irrele-
vant IgGs of corresponding isotype were substracted [19].
CD31 being also expressed to small extent on platelets, it
was previously ensured that circulating MP bearing CD31
mainly originate from endothelial cells and are therefore
a reliable marker of endothelial damage [16]. No direct
comparison between capture by annexin V and antibodies
can be afforded because affinities for the respective lig-
ands are different. It has to be indicated that truly soluble
forms of membrane antigens do not generate prothrombi-
nase activity. The method enables specific measurement
of procoagulant phospholipids attached to each MP
phenotype.
Characterization of anti-phospholipid antibodies
The presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies was estab-
lished according to the recommendations of the Standard-
ization SubCommittee of the International Society for
Thrombosis and Haemostasis using diluted plasma coag-
ulation assays using a 3 step procedure: (i) diluted plasma
coagulation assays : dilution of patient plasma into nor-
mal plasma (Rossner index), (ii) diluted thromboplastin
time, (iii) diluted Russell's Viper Venom Time (DRVVT).
Briefly, the presence of circulating anticoagulant antibod-
ies was evidenced by the LAC screen test and the presence
of anti- phospholipids was confirmed in a neutralizing
assay (LAC confirm) as recommended by the manufac-
turer (Instrumentation Laboratories, Lexington, USA). A
DRVVT normalized ratio [(DRVVT screen sample/DRVVT
screen normal plasma)/(DRVVT confirm sample/DRVVT

confirm normal plasma)] > 1.2 was considered positive,
indicating the presence of lupus anticoagulant.
Antiphospholipid immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM) were
measured by enzyme immunosorbent assay as recom-
mended by the manufacturer (Pasteur Diagnostics, Paris,
France). The presence of APL was verified on two separate
occasions one year apart.
Results
The patient, with a previous history of mesenteric vein
thrombosis (see methods), was admitted to our hospital
with a six hours anterior myocardial infarction (STEMI).
Angio-coronarography revealed left anterior descending
coronary artery (LAD) and diagonal branch thrombotic
occlusion (Figure 1A). The right coronary and circumflex
arteries were devoid of any atherosclerotic lesion. PTCA
and stent placement were performed under abciximab
treatment. The issue was satisfactory (TIMI flow grade 3).
Anti-thrombin and -platelet treatments were started
immediately, oral anticoagulation by vitamin-K antago-
nists was initiated at day five. Hyper-leukocytosis
(15,500/mm3) and a normal platelet count (236,000/
mm3) were observed together with a creatine kinase peak
at 6267 IU/l and troponin I elevation (27 ng/ml). Anticar-
diolipin IgG and IgM (17 and 15 GPL/ml, respectively;
At patient admission, left coronary angiogram revealed thrombotic obstruction of left anterior descending artery (A)Figure 1
At patient admission, left coronary angiogram revealed thrombotic obstruction of left anterior descending artery (A). Large
thrombus in the right auricle emerging through tricuspid valve within right ventricle (B) and apical thrombus complicating ante-
rior aneurysm (C) detected by computer tomography scan, performed the next day. Large thrombus emerging from superiour
vena cava and prolabing in the right auricle, evidenced by Trans-oesophagial echocardiography (D). Extensive thrombus emerg-
ing from superiour vena cava within right auricle, evidenced by magnetic resonance imaging (E).

16.5 and 12 GPL/ml one year ago, normal value < 10
GPL/ml) were present. Anticoagulant antibodies could be
evidenced (DRVVT normalized ratio = 1.4, see methods).
No anti beta-2 glycoprotein I or anti-PF4 (platelet factor
4) immunoglobulin could be detected. No systemic lupus
erythematosus could be evidenced (antinuclear antibody
titer below 1/80, absence of anti-DNA antibody). Coagu-
lation parameters (antithrombin, protein C, protein S)
were within the physiological range. Facteur V Leiden was
excluded.
Trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) and computed
tomography (CT) scan performed the next day revealed a
complicated large anterior aneurysm with apical throm-
bus and a right auricle and ventricle thrombus localiza-
tion. Severe left ventricular dysfunction was evidenced by
a reduced ejection fraction (0.35) (Figures 1B,C). Trans-
esophageal echo-cardiography and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of large thrombi
emerging from the superior vena cava and prolapsed
within the right auricle (Figure 1D,E). No pulmonary
embolism could be initially evidenced. One month later,
the absence of intra-cardiac thrombus was verified by TTE.
A distal pulmonary embolism was however revealed by
helical CT scan.
Measurement of procoagulant microparticles
(MP)
In the patient, high amounts of procoagulant MP were
still detectable by capture onto annexin V at day 20, at dis-
tance of STEMI. MP levels showed a two-fold elevation
with respect to values observed 5 days after STEMI in a
subset of comparable patients without APS. Values were
9-times higher than those measured in 50 healthy volun-
teers (Patient: 21 vs. STEMI without APS: 9.7 ± 1.5 vs HV:
2.3 ± 0.1 nM PhtdSer).
Procoagulant MP were mainly of platelet and endothelial
origin (7.7 and 0.5 nM PhtdSer, respectively) [20,21]. MP
levels appeared respectively 6- and 3-fold higher than
those detected in the subset of STEMI patients with no
APS. Furthermore, levels were respectively 13- and 25-fold
greater than values detected in HV (Table 1). Endothelial-
derived MP were highly elevated with respect to other
STEMI patients, suggesting a specific contribution to
thrombotic propensity in APS.
Discussion
Testifying to major vascular damage, levels of circulating
MP measured in the patient are in accordance with the
important platelet and endothelial activation reported in
APS [6,15]. However, such values are unexpected when
detected at distance of STEMI (day 20). Indeed, platelet-
derived MP were evidenced by capture on fibrinogen, as a
peak occurring 8 hours after PTCA and returning to base-
line within 48 h [22]. Procoagulant MP revealed by cap-
ture onto annexin V, remain slightly detectable 8 days
after STEMI [16]. The persisting and combined effects of
endothelial and platelet activation evidenced in the
patient suggest a pivotal role in the development of unu-
sual extensive intracardiac thrombi, despite important
anti-thrombin and anti-platelet treatments.
Elevated levels of procoagulant MP are pathogenic mark-
ers of APS as well as thrombotic propensity. Thus, in this
particular case, the true initiator of the intracardiac
thrombi remains difficult to determine. The presence of
APL was recently associated with elevated plasma levels of
procoagulant MP of endothelial origin. Pointing to their
possible role in thrombotic propensity, endothelial cells
were shown to specifically release MP with high procoag-
ulant activity when treated by the plasma from APS
patients [15]. In our patient, moderate APL titers com-
bined to drastic and persisting MP elevation may have
impede the benefits of anti-thrombotic drugs, their
decreasing expected effects on MP release [23-25] being
overwhelmed by a sustained vascular stimulation
[1,6,15]. Measurement of MP could be valuable in the fol-
Table 1: Circulating microparticles (MP) in patient with APL (day 20) and in STEMI patients without APL (n = 9, day 5).

Microparticles were captured onto insolubilized annexin V or on anti GPIb and anti CD31 antibodies to identify the respective contribution of
platelet and endothelial-derived MP. MP catalytic phospholipid content was measured by prothombinase assay as nM Phosphatidylserine equivalents
(PhtdSer Eq.). All STEMI patients were treated by PTCA, under abciximab coverage. No direct comparison between levels of MP captured onto
annexin V and antibodies can be performed because affinities for the respective ligands are certainly different.
