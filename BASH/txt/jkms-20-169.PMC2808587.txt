INTRODUCTION
Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have recently emer-
ged as important nosocomial pathogens that mainly affect
patients with severe underlying diseases (1, 2). VRE was first
reported In Korea in 1992. Since then, however, the incidence
of VRE was low until 2000 when an increase in VRE infec-
tions began to be reported in many hospitals (3-6). A nation-
wide survey suggested that the main mode of transmission
was interhospital spread (4). Nowadays it is clear that VRE
is a major newly established pathogen in Korean hospitals.
At the end of 2000, we recognized a sudden increase in
the frequency of hemato-oncological patients with VRE bac-
teremia (8 patients) in our institution compared with previ-
ous years when there was 1 bacteremia in 1997 and 2 each
in 1998 and 1999. This trend continued in 2001 in which
there were 11 hemato-oncological patients with VRE bac-
teremia.
We herein conducted a retrospective analysis of the clini-
cal and molecular epidemiologic characteristics of the VRE
bacteremic patients who received hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) or cytotoxic chemotherapy between
January 2000 and December 2001.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Setting and patients
The Catholic HSCT Center belongs to St. Mary’s Hospital,
a 600-bed, university-affiliated, tertiary care teaching hospi-
tal. The HSCT center deals with more than 250 HSCT per
year, which represents more than half of the annual HSCT
cases in Korea. It follows that the analysis of clinical data for
patients at our institution should provide reliable informa-
tion about overall trends in hemato-oncological patients in
Korea.
We reviewed retrospectively the medical records of all 19
VRE bacteremic patients over a 2-yr period (January 2000
through December 2001) in the Catholic HSCT Center affili-
ated with the Catholic University of Korea, College of Medi-
cine.
Fever was defined as a single oral temperature of ≥38.3℃
or a temperature of ≥38.0℃ for ≥1 hr. Neutropenia was

Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcal Bacteremia in a Hematology Unit:
Molecular Epidemiology and Analysis of Clinical Course*
An increase in vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) bacteremia in hemato-
oncological patients (n=19) in our institution from 2000 through 2001 led us to
analyze the molecular epidemiologic patterns and clinical features unique to our
cases. The pulsed field gel electrophoresis of the isolates revealed that the bac-
teremia was not originated from a single clone but rather showed endemic pattern
of diverse clones with small clusters. A different DNA pattern of blood and stool
isolates from one patient suggested exogenous rather than endogenous route of
infection. Enterococcus faecium carrying vanA gene was the causative pathogen
in all cases. Patients with VRE bacteremia showed similar clinical courses com-
pared with those with vancomycin-susceptible enterococcal (VSE) bacteremia.
Vancomycin resistance did not seem to be a poor prognostic factor because of
similar mortality (5/8, 62.5%) noted in VSE bacteremia. Initial disease severity and
neutropenic status may be major determinants of prognosis in patients with VRE
bacteraemia.

defined as a neutrophil count of less than 500 cells/ L, or a
count of less than 1,000 cells/ L with a predicted decrease
to less than 500 cells/ L.
The term clinically significant VRE bacteremia was defined
as at least two blood cultures positive for vancomycin-resis-
tant Enterococcus faecium or E. faecalis (7).
An empirical antibiotic regimen was given to febrile patients
according to the guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society
of America (8).
Identification of isolates, and testing of antibiotic suscepti-
bility
Identification was performed with a conventional Microscan
panel (Dade International, West Sacramento, CA, U.S.A.).
VRE isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by
the agar dilution method and the results were interpreted
according to the Natinal Committee for Clinical Laboratory
Standards 2002 breakpoints (9). Enterococcus faecalis ATCC
29212 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 were used for
quality control.
Genotyping
Vancomycin resistance genotypes (vanA, vanB, vanC1, van-
C2/C3) were tested by amplifying the respective genes by
PCR (10), with some modifications. Primers for vanA were
5 -GGGAAAACGACAATTGC-3 (175-191) and 5 -ATT-
GCCG GCGTAACATG-3 (891-907); for vanB, 5 -ATGG-
GAAGCCGA TAGTC-3 (173-189) and 5 -CCAGCTCC-
TTGCTTTAG-3 (791-807); for vanC1, 5 -GGTATCAAG-
GAAACCTC-3 (246-272) and 5 -TCGATACTAC CGCC-
TTC-3 (1051-1067), and for vanC2/C3, 5 -CTCCTACGAT-
T CTCTTG-3 (455-486) and 5 -GAATTTCCAGAACGA-
GC-3 (869-885). Strains E. faecium BM4147 with vanA and
ddIE. faecium, E. faecalis V583 (vanB, ddIE. faecalis), E. gallinarum
BM 41745 (vanC1), and E. casseliflavus ATCC 24788 (vanC2/
C3) served as positive controls.
Molecular epidemiological typing
Fourteen of the 19 VRE isolates were typed by pulsed field
gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with SmaI as restriction enzyme,
as previously described in detail (6). In addition, we obtained
VRE isolates from specimens other than blood (urine and
stool) that were available from eight patients without bac-
teremia (July 2001 through December 2001). These addi-
tional non-bacteremic (NB) isolates were also subjected to
PFGE to investigate whether they might involve strains iden-
tical to or closely related (2-3 fragment differences) to strains
in the patients with bacteremia.
PFGE was performed with a CHEF-DR II apparatus (Bio-
Rad Korea, Seoul, Korea). The conditions were: initial switch
time 0.5 sec, run time 20 hr, final switch time 40 sec. After
ethidium bromide staining, patterns were compared and
anayzed with Uniband/Map (version 99; UVItech, Cambridge,
U.K.).
Data collection and analysis
We compared VRE bacteremic patients with a group of
hematological patients with vancomycin-susceptible E. faeci-
um (VSE) bacteremia (n=8) arising during the same period.
Baseline information included age, sex, and underlying
disease. A simplified acute physiologic score (SAPS II) was
assigned to all patients at the onset of bacteremia (11). We
also followed up the patients’ record until January 2002, to
permit a survival analysis. The starting point of survivial was
the date when bacteremia was detected.
Statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS 10.0 (SPSS
Korea, Seoul, Korea). If the data were in the category of con-
tinous variables, t-test was performed. In case of data with
ordinal or nominal scale, nonparametric tests such as chi-
square, Mann-Whitney test, etc were done. P values <0.05
were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Clinical characteristics of patients with VRE bacteremia
Table 1 gives the characteristics of the patients with VRE
bacteremia. There were 8 cases of VRE bacteremia in the
year 2000, and 11 cases in 2001 (Fig. 1). Eighteen of the 19
patients (94.7%) received broad-spectrum antibiotics prior
to detection of the bacteremia. Only eight patients with VRE
were able to receive quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q-D) because
this was only formally available in our institution from 2001.
The other 11 patients received high-dose ampicillin/sulbac-
tam plus gentamicin, or imipenem monotherapy. Four of the
8 patients receiving Q-D died, compared with all the patients
who did not receive Q-D (11/11).
Microbiological characteristics of patients with VRE
bacteremia
All 19 VRE isolates were identified as E. faecium. All were
also van A genotype. Their antimicrobial susceptibility pro-
files showed high-level gentamicin resistance (100%), where-
as only 14.3% had high-level resistance to streptomycin. None
of them were resistant to Q-D or linezolid.
Comparison of the clinical characteristics with
VSE-bacteremia
Table 2 compares the demographic characteristics of patients
with VRE versus those with VSE bacteremia. Simplified

(42.6±12.8 in VSE vs. 41.4±13.7 in VRE, p>0.05, respec-
tively), indicating that initial disease severity at the time of
bacteremia did not differ significantly. Age, gender ratio, and
other demographic characteristics were also similar.
The VSE group had a lower median number of days to
bacteremia and fewer days of hospitalization than the VRE
group, but the mortality of the two groups did not differ sig-
nificantly (62.5% for VSE vs. 78.9% for VRE, p>0.05, respec-
tively). More patients with VRE received antibiotics before
bacteremia than those with VSE (94.7% vs. 62.5%, p<0.05,
respectively). The median days survived for VSE was not sta-
tistically different from that for VRE as shown in Table 2 (log
rank 1.55, p=0.2130).
Characteristics of patients with VRE bacteremia who
survived and of those who died
Table 3 compares patients with VRE bacteremia who sur-
vived (n=6) with those who died (n=15). Age, number of
previous admissions, days to detection, total days of hospi-
talization, and neutropenic days did not differ significantly
between the two groups. But SAPS II was significantly high-
er in those that died than in those that survived. While all
the patients who survived recovered from the neutropenia,
40% of those who died did not.
Molecular epidemiological characteristics of patients with
VRE bacteremia
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the occurrence of VRE bacteremia
appeared initially to be sporadic. However, its frequency began
to increase from April 2001 and reached its peak through
June 2001, which suggested us that there might have been
a cluster of outbreaks in our institution. We therefore per-
formed PFGE in order to determine whether the VRE bac-

teremias from 2000 to 2001 were clonally related.
Most of the PFGE fingerprint patterns differed from one
another, but there were two very small clusters of clones (C1-
3 and E1-3, in Fig. 2 and Table 1). C1 was isolated on 9 May
2001, and C2 appeared about one month later (15 June 2001).
As already suggested in Fig. 1, an outbreak did occur during
the period May through June 2002, but it was very small (a
mini-outbreak). Another closely related strain (C3) emerged
5 months later (22 November 2001) in a room adjacent to
where C2 had appeared (room numbers 1308 and 1309, res-
pectively, Table 1). There also occurred another mini-out-
break from December 2000 (E1) through January 2001 (E3).
Three months later, a closely-related strain (E2) emerged in
the same ward as E1. However the PFGE type E strains did
not appear again (up to the end of 2001).
After examining the clonality of VRE bacteremia, we per-
formed additional PFGE analyses, this time of NB isolates,
in order to search for a possible source of transmission from
patients without bacteremia. As shown in Fig. 3, we found
three NB strains which were clonally related to those from
patients with VRE bacteremia. The urine isolate (25 July
2001) from patient NB8 (lane 31 in Fig. 3) was virtually
identical to PFGE type F which was isolated on 9 February
2001. The stool isolate (30 August 2001) from patient NB7
(lane 30) was closely related to PFGE type B (19 April 2001,
lane 9), and the urine and stool isolates (28 December 2001)
from patient NB3 (lane 21 and 22) were probably related to
PFGE type C2. These patterns are summarized in Fig. 4.
The strains in lane 15 (blood) and 16 (stool) were from the
same patient as lane 13 (C3), but the PFGE patterns of the
blood and stool isolates differed from each other.
DISCUSSION
In this study, all of 19 isolates were E. faecium of vanA geno-
type; other vancomycin-resistant genotypes such as vanB or
vanC were not found. This feature is consistent with other
instances of VRE in Korea. In a Korean tertiary care hospital
with 1,550 beds all of 330 VRE isolates were vanA (6). It fol-
lows that vanA is the major genotype in Korea although a case
of vanB has also been reported (12). The 5th Korean Nation-

wide Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance also revealed
an increase in vancomycin-resistant E. faecium in the period
1997-2001 (3).
We used patients with VSE for comparison with the VRE
group, as we thought that a control group that simply did
not have VRE bacteremia would not be suitable because it
would differ in many respects: disease severity as well as clini-
cal characteristics would be quite different from those with
VRE, and it would be hard to adjust for these variables. On
the other hand, the initial severity of disease as represented
by SAPS II was not significantly different in VSE group from
that of the VRE bacteremia group. The well-established risk
factors for VRE acquisition are neutropenia, prolonged hospi-
talization, prior use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and hypoal-
buminemia (13-17). These factors, with the exception of days
of hospitalization, did not differ significantly between our
VRE and VSE groups. However, as the number of patients
with VSE (n=8) was very small, and less than half of those
with VRE (n=19), we think the variables predictive of the
acquisition of VRE should be evaluated in a larger study.
The influence of vancomycin-resistance on mortality is con-
troversial. Some authors have insisted on its importance (18-
20), whereas others are of the contrary opinion (21, 22). Since
the mortality of our patients with VSE did not differ from
those with VRE, it is unlikely that vancomycin-resistance
itself affects the prognosis. Our findings suggest that entero-
coccal infection itself, or its degree of virulence, rather than
vancomycin-resistance, is a determinant of prognosis.
Several authors have suggested that Q-D and linezolid
would both be effective in treating VRE (23-27). In our study,
the patients who received Q-D appeared to do better than
those receiving other antimicrobials, though the number of
cases (n=8) was too small to be sure.
Among the 19 patients with VRE bacteremia, expired
patients had significantly higher SAPS II values than those
who survived, and 60% of the latter did not recover from
neutropenia. Although further cases are needed to establish
the predictors of outcome in VRE bacteremia, we think that
initial disease severity, and host immunity as reflected in neu-

tropenia, could be major determinants.
Since its first isolation in 1992, VRE seemed to be rare
until 1997 after which an abrupt increase in VRE infections
was reported by many hospitals in Korea from 1998 onwards
(3-6). One study of VRE infection in a Korean tertiary teach-
ing hospital revealed that the increase in VRE was probably
due to the increased use of oral vancomycin to treat Clostridi-
um difficile infections, and clonal spread (6). Another nation-
wide study in Korea also suggested that interhospital spread
contributed to the rapid increase of VRE in many hospitals
(4). The findings of our study suggested that spread by a few
clones among heterogenous ones may have contributed to the
increase in VRE bacteremia. However, it could not be the
only mechanism because the PFGE analysis demonstrated a
high degree of diversity among the isolates, and bacteremia
of endogenous origin could not be excluded. As reported ear-
lier, the hemato-oncological disease itself has been recognized
as an important risk factor for the acquisition of VRE (12,
28, 29). In addition to the lack of host immunity, breakdown
of the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier and subsequent translo-
cation of bowel flora could play a major role in the acquisi-
tion of VRE bacteremia (30-32). In other words, endogenous
infection by translocation as well as exogenous transmission
from other patients (33, 34) or from fomites (35) could have
been another major source of VRE bacteremia in our patients.
However, there was also a perplexing but nevertheless impor-
tant observation arguing against the endogenous route. As
illustrated in Fig. 3, blood and stool isolates from one bac-
teremic patient yielded completely different DNA band pat-
terns (lanes 15 and 16, respectively). If the patient’s bacteremia
was from her own bowel flora, the DNA patterns of blood and
stool isolates should have been identical or at least closely-
related. This finding suggested that the VRE, at least in this
patient, was not of endogenous origin but came from someone
or somewhere else. However, the possibility that the patient
may be colonized with more than one strain or that there was
transfer of the vanA gene could not be excluded.
While there have been several reports of a single clone domi-
nating a VRE outbreak (29, 36, 37), many molecular epi-
demiologic studies have shown that most of the VRE in a
given hospital is clonally diverse (14, 39-42). In our case, the
VRE of our bacteremic patients was clonally diverse with
two small clusters of mini-outbreaks (E1-3 and C1-3 in Fig.
2), which suggested that VRE already became endemic in
our institution. We also found three strains from non-bac-
teremic patients were clonally related to those in bacteremic
patients (PFGE types B, C2, and F), and each of these strains
appeared sporadically at intervals of 4-6 months. Whereas
strains of type E (found only in bacteremic patients), B and
F did not appear again after August 2001, type C strains con-
tinued to emerge up to the end of the study. Based on these
findings, we assume that there were multiple clones of VRE
coexisting with at least two primary clones of sporadic pat-
terns in our unit, as also postulated in another instance (43).
Though both exogenous and endogenous modes of infection
could be major causes of bacteremia in our patients, the evi-
dence for mini-outbreaks in the midst of clonal diversity
strongly suggests that strict precautions are crucial to pre-
vent nosocomial transmission of VRE (44, 45).
In summary, patients with VRE (all were vanA E. faecium)
bacteremia showed heterogenous molecular epidemiologic
pattern with some small clusters, but vancomycin-resistance
did not seem to be a prognostic factor because of the similar
mortality in the VSE group. We consider that greater atten-
tion should be paid to the prevention and management of
VRE bacteremia because it is now one of the important estab-
lished pathogens in hemato-oncological patients in Korean
hospitals.
