Hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing invasive fungal infections. This is a major cause of
morbidity and mortality. We report a case of a 17-year-old male patient diagnosed with severe idiopathic acquired aplastic anemia
who developed fungal pneumonitis due to Rhizomucor sp. and rhinoencephalitis due to Scedosporium apiospermum 6 and 8 months
after undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant from an HLA-matched unrelated donor. Discussion highlights risk
factors for invasive fungal infections (i.e., mucormycosis and scedosporiosis), its clinical features, and the factors that must be
taken into account to successfully treat them (early diagnosis, correction of predisposing factors, aggressive surgical debridement,
and antifungal and adjunctive therapies).
1. Introduction
Hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (HSCT) recipients are at
increased risk of developing invasive fungal infections (IFIs).
This is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Invasive
aspergillosis (IA) remains the most commonly reported IFIs
among these patients, accounting for nearly 60% of all
the IFIs, with a mortality rate of 60–85% (mostly in the
postengraftment period after HSCT) [1–3]. Nowadays, we
are noticing a change among the proﬁle of the ﬁlamentous
IFIs, with an increase in the incidence of IFIs by moulds
other than Aspergillus species. They, now, account for nearly
14% of all IFIs (half of these are caused by Mucorales spp.,
followed by Fusarium spp.) [3, 4]. Perhaps the widespread
usage of new antifungal therapies might contribute for
the emergence of these unusual IFIs [4]. These infections
are very diﬃcult to diagnose in an early stage, which
makes treatment a challenge and overall mortality rate very
high. We report a case of a 17-year-old male patient who
developed fungal pneumonitis due to Rhizomucor sp. and
rhinoencephalitis due to Scedosporium apiospermum 6 and
8 months after undergoing allogeneic HSCT from an HLA-
matched unrelated donor.
2. Case Report
A 17-year-old Caucasian male was diagnosed with severe
idiopathic acquired aplastic anemia in January 2007. He had
no related genotypically matched donor for HSCT, so he
underwent a 5-month course of therapy with cyclosporine

and antithymocyte globulin with no response. In February
2008, he received an allogeneic HSCT from an HLA-matched
unrelated donor (10/10 HLA antigens). The preparative regi-
men consisted of alemtuzumab, ﬂudarabine, and cyclophos-
phamide. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis
consisted of tacrolimus and methotrexate (starting day 1). He
showed evidence of hematopoietic engraftment on day 17.
Digestive tract GVHD (biopsy proven) developed on day 25
and was treated with corticosteroids (prednisone at 1 mg/Kg
twice a day) and tacrolimus, with gradual resolution. The
evaluation on day 33 showed complete chimerism and a
normal bone marrow. He was discharged on day 41 with
tacrolimus, oral prednisone and antifungal prophylaxis with
ﬂuconazole 400 mg/day. His outpatient course was com-
plicated by gradual development of leucopenia, requiring
granulocyte colony-stimulating-factor therapy. On day 115,
the patient was admitted to the hospital for febrile neu-
tropenia with cough and odynophagia. He received antibiotic
therapy with piperacillin plus tazobactam and amikacin
although no infectious agent was isolated. Cytomegalovirus
and Epstein-Barr virus infections were also excluded. The
day 119 evaluation showed complete chimerism and normal
bone marrow. He recovered and was discharged on day
125. He did well until day 165, when he was admitted
for an acute tonsillitis with febrile neutropenia. A cervical
computerized tomography (CT) showed an abscess in the
peritonsillar space. A tonsillar biopsy was made which
revealed a polymorphic inﬁltrate eosinophil-rich and no
other ﬁndings. No infectious agent was isolated. He received
antibiotic therapy with piperacillin plus tazobactam and
antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole. As he maintained
fever, clindamycin was added to therapy in order to increase
the synergistic eﬀect against anaerobes (essentially mouth
anaerobes that are partially covered by piperacillin and
tazobactam) and to increase peritonsillar tissue antibiotic
diﬀusion, thus allowing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus coverage. There was resolution of the febrile episode
and the patient was discharged on day 179. At this time,
he maintained GVHD therapy with steroids and tacrolimus
and antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole (200 mg three
times daily). Close followup was done. Although somewhat
better, the patient maintained persistent complaints of
cough and serous sputum. The haematological values were
stable. On the thoracic X-ray (Figure 1(a)) there was small
pulmonary node that gradually enlarged so he forwarded a
thoracic CT, on day 192 which revealed a cavitated lesion on
the right superior pulmonary lobe. Galactomannan antigen
was negative. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL) were performed. Thoracic surgery was proposed, but
the patient was considered not ﬁt to such intervention.
At this time, antifungal treatment with voriconazole was
started. Nevertheless, the patient’s clinical condition began
to deteriorate with the development of persistent cough (no
diﬀerences on sputum), dyspnea, headaches, otalgia, fever,

and neutropenia. On day 211 he was admitted to the hospital.
The patient developed hemoptysis and acute respiratory
and renal failure, so he required intensive care unit (ICU)
admission. The fungal culture result of the BAL revealed
a Rhizomucor sp. infection on day 215. Liposomal ampho-
tericin B and caspofungin combination therapy was started.
The patient started to get better, and he was discharged from
the ICU to the ward on day 223. However, he maintained per-
sistent fever and the pulmonary cavitated nodule continued
to get worse on thoracic X-ray image (Figure 1(b)). On day
237, he started to complain of right periorbital edema and
gradually developed sinusitis, exoftalmia, and amaurosis of
the right eye. CT scan of the perinasal sinuses revealed an
inﬁltrative lesion of the perinasal sinuses with ethmoiditis
and compression of the right optic nerve (Figure 2). Eth-
moidectomy was performed on day 264. Pathology analysis
showed signs of ethmoiditis and numerous fungal hyphae
(Figures 3(a)–3(f)). Microbiological analysis revealed fungal
infection due to Scedosporium apiospermum. As his clinical
condition continued to deteriorate, antifungal combination
therapy was changed to posaconazole along with liposomal
amphotericin B, but no response was obtained. On day 310,
he started to complain of persistent headache, and on day
322, he developed left hemiparesis and dysarthria probably
due to rhinoencephalitis. Consciousness became gradually
depressed and death overcame on day 324 post HSCT.
3. Discussion
This case highlights the emergence of two unusual ﬁlamen-
tous IFIs in a young patient who received an allogeneic
HSCT from an unrelated HLA-matched donor, ﬁrst with a
pulmonary mucormycosis and then with a rhinocerebral sce-
dosporiosis. Rhizomucor sp. belongs to the order Mucorales.
Recent reclassiﬁcation has abolished the order Zygomycetes
and placed the order Mucorales in the subphylum Mucormy-
cotina. Therefore, we refer to infection caused by Mucorales
as mucormycosis, rather than zygomycosis [5, 6]. The genus
Scedosporium consists of two medically important species:
Scedosporium apiospermum (and its teleomorph or sexual
state Pseudallescheria boydii) and Scedosporium proliﬁcans.
These mould infections are known as scedosporiosis [7, 8].
Invasive mucormycosis and scedosporiosis are unusual and
highly lethal IFIs that can arise in the postengraftment period
of HSCT. Isolated, they can achieve a mortality rate superior
to 90% in this kind of patients [9, 10]. To our knowledge,
there have been few reports of these two IFIs arising in
the same patient [11, 12]. These moulds can be widely
recovered from the environment [5, 7, 8]. A common route
of acquisition is the respiratory tract through inhalation of
infectious spores that may establish an initial infection in
the sinuses. Other less common routes of acquisition include
the intestinal tract following ingestion or by inoculation
through breaches in or penetrating injuries to the skin.
Angioinvasion is a prominent feature of these IFIs progress-
ing to tissue necrosis and infarction, and this presumably
accounts for their ability to cause rapidly invasive infections
sometimes with dissemination [5, 7, 8]. From a clinical
standpoint, mucormycosis describes infections characterized
by one or more of a triad of rhinocerebral, pulmonary,
and disseminated disease [5]. Scedosporiosis represents a
broad spectrum of clinical diseases, ranging from transient
colonization of the respiratory tract to invasive localized
disease (mostly involving the bones and joints but also
4 Case Reports in Medicine
the skin in which case it is known as mycetoma) and at
times disseminated disease [7, 8]. The disseminated form
of these IFIs is mostly seen among immunocompromised
patients, especially in those with hematologic malignancies
during periods of prolonged neutropenia [5, 7, 8]. Innate
immune defenses comprising phagocytic responses play a
critical role in host defense against these ﬁlamentous fungi
[5, 7, 8]. So, it seems plausible that host defense defects
that occur in HSCT recipients as a result of prolonged
neutropenia and lymphopenia have a profound impact on
the susceptibility and severity of these IFIs [5, 7]. Other
factors could also confer high susceptibility to disseminated
disease, such as steroidtherapy (maybe because they cause
impaired phagocyte function), GVHD (the greater the extent
of mucosal injury the greater the risk of IFIs), and serum
iron availability (increased iron facilitates fungal growth),
but further studies are needed [2, 5, 7, 8, 13]. It seems that
antifungal prophylaxis can also have a selection eﬀect for
these IFIs as Rhizomucor sp. are resistant to voriconazole
therapy, and its usage as prophylactic therapy may cause
often breakthrough mucormycosis [4, 14]. Scedosporium
spp. have been known to emerge as pathogens in patients
receiving amphotericin B, ﬂuconazole, or itraconazole [7]. In
this reported case, the patient had multiple high-risk factors
for the development of IFIs, as he received an allogeneic
HSCT from an unrelated donor, had neutropenia for a
long period, fever (so he received large-spectrum antibiotic
therapy for several times), developed gastrointestinal GVHD,
and required chronic immunosupression for GVHD control
[2, 5, 7, 8, 13, 15, 16]. Although prophylactic ﬂuconazole
therapy is highly eﬀective in reducing IFIs-related morbidity
and mortality in these patients, it applies only to ﬂuconazole-
susceptible Candida species infections (Candida kruseii and
some strains of Candida glabatra are not susceptible to
ﬂuconazole therapy) [17–19]. Because invasive candidiasis
is more frequent in the pre-engraftment period, we started
ﬂuconazole at a dosage of 200–400mg/day until day+75
[17, 19, 20]. As the patient continued to require high-dose
corticosteroid therapy (prednisone >1 mg/kg/day) for diges-
tive tract GVHD control, in the postengraftment period, we
changed prophylactic antifungal therapy to posaconazole,
according to our service protocol, in order to prevent IA.
This protocol is based in a clinical trial published in 2007
by Ullmann et al. This clinical trial enrolled 600 patients
and compared ﬂuconazole versus posaconazole prophylaxis
for IFIs. It showed a clear beneﬁt toward posaconazole
prophylaxis in the prevention of IA (OR = 0.31 [0.13–0.75],
P < .006) without inferior eﬃcacy in the prevention of IFIs
(OR = 0.56 [0.30–1.07], P < .07) [21]. Nevertheless, the
patient developed a breakthrough pulmonary mucormycosis
while on posaconazole prophylaxis. Other similar cases have
been reported [22]. In 2010, Winston et al. published a
prospective study that evaluated the eﬃcacy, safety, break-
through infections and antimicrobial resistance of long-term
posaconazole prophylaxis in 106 consecutive adult allogeneic
HSCT recipients [23]. They reported breakthrough IFIs in
7.5% of patients while on posaconazole within 6 months
after HSCT. Only 2 of 9 infecting isolates tested were
resistant to posaconazole (both Candida glabrata). Mean
peak and trough plasma posaconazole concentrations were
relatively low in neutropenic patients with oral mucositis
and other factors possibly aﬀecting optimal absorption of
posaconazole [23]. In this case report, the isolated Rhizopus
was not identiﬁed at the species level, and its sensibility to
posaconazole was not tested. However, other factors may also
have aﬀected the serum levels of posaconazole. Tacrolimus
could be one of such factors, because its concomitant use
can reduce the optimal serum levels of posaconazole [24].
We adjusted tacrolimus dosage according to its serum levels.
on the other hand, the patient had digestive tract GVHD.
This could also be responsible for reduced serum levels of
posaconazole [23, 24]. Therefore, when using prophylactic
posaconazole, we must be aware of other factors that may
aﬀect its absorption/serum levels and implement strategies
to improve posaconazole exposure, including the use of
higher doses, administration with an acidic beverage, or
restriction of proton pump inhibitors [23]. There are ﬁve
factors that are crucial to successful treatment of these IFIs.
The ﬁrst one is early diagnosis: to recognize patients at
increased risk and early signs of infection. This is the most
important and troublesome factor, because it is diﬃcult
to make an early diagnosis of these IFIs. Initially, clinical
features of pulmonary mucormycosis often resemble that
of IA in severely immunocompromised patients such as
occurred in this case [5, 8]. However, it is the consideration
of mucormycosis or scedosporiosis as a diagnosis that may
lead to timely conﬁrmation by successful biopsy/culture of
the causative organism [5, 7, 8]. Thoracic CT scan is the most
sensitive imagiologic tool to detect early pulmonary IFIs,
and, therefore, it must be considered the “gold standard”.
Some authors perform weekly CT for early detection of IFIs
[25]. However, due to economic reasons, this is not the
usual procedure in our service. Ordinarily, these patients
are monitored with thoracic X-ray performed twice a week.
Thoracic CT is performed only on clinical and/or imagio-
logic suspicion of IFIs. This approach has several limitations,
because thoracic X-ray is too insensitive for the diagnosis
of IFIs. In early stages of IFIs, thoracic X-ray ﬁndings
may be scarce, nonspeciﬁc, or even undetectable. Therefore,
many IFIs may only be diagnosed in later stages by this
technique, thus aﬀecting the prognosis of these patients [25].
Diagnosis can be conﬁrmed by biopsy of aﬀected tissues,
when accessible, although cultures may prove negative.
Genus/species identiﬁcation is made by culturing the organ-
ism and documenting characteristic morphological features
[5, 8]. The problem is that fungal culture identiﬁcation takes
long. Even the ﬁndings on pathology of Scedosporium spp. are
very similar to Aspergillus spp. and other hyalohyphomycotic
species, and there are no serologic or molecular speciﬁc
diagnostic procedures available to make correct diagnosis
faster [8]. So, we started voriconazole empirically though
galactomannan antigen was negative. Obviously, there was
no response because Rhizopus sp. are resistant to this therapy
and the IFIs progressed despite later adequate antifungal
therapy. Research is needed in order to discover newer
and faster speciﬁc diagnostic procedures. It is possible
that in the near future, some serologic and molecular
speciﬁc diagnostic procedures may become available (e.g.,
Case Reports in Medicine 5
peptidorhamnomannam for Pseudallescheria boydii) [8]. The
second consideration is to remove/reduce any reversible
predisposing factor such as, for example, reducing the level of
immunosuppression [5]. The third consideration is surgical
aggressive debridement as early as possible. Surgical excision
of the disease has been a component of the standard of care
and should be considered whenever possible as it improves
survival [5, 7, 8]. This is the second most important message
to remember from this case report: surgery cannot be delayed
and must be done as early as possible to achieve beneﬁt as
long as IFIs are suspected. Even among immunocompetent
individuals, infections caused by these agents usually require
extensive debridement and sometimes amputation to achieve
cure [8]. For these reasons, extensive plastic surgery may be
required [5]. The fourth consideration is antifungal therapy.
Unfortunately, because the relative rarity of these infections,
the choice of antifungal therapy is less well established, and it
has been based on experience, supplemented by information
gleaned from animal model studies and in vitro susceptibility
data. Monotherapy with liposomal amphotericin B has been
a classical choice for mucormycosis. Doses in the range
of 10–15 mg/kg/day have been used although the optimal
dose remains unclear [5]. Posaconazole can also be an
alternative to this IFIs [26, 27]. Once again, the optimal
dosage is unknown. Dosage of 800 mg/day in divided doses
has been reported [5]. There are also case reports that
describe successful outcomes with combination of liposomal
amphotericin B with either caspofungin or posaconazole
where single-agent therapy has failed [5, 6, 9]. Caspofungin
monotherapy has no in vitro activity against Mucorales.
Nevertheless, Ibrahim et al. showed, in vivo, that caspofungin
had signiﬁcant activity against Rhizopus oryzae when it was
given prophylactically but not when therapy was started
after infection [28]. This study has shown that Rhizopus
oryzae, the most common pathogen causing mucormycosis,
expresses the target enzyme for echinocandins (1,3 beta-
glucan synthase) [28]. Though we did not identiﬁed the
isolated Rhizopus at the species level, these studies suggest
that caspofungin may have a role in combination therapy
against mucormycosis, and, therefore, combination antifun-
gal therapy for mucormycosis should be considered. In the
other hand, antifungal therapy with echinocandins seems
to be noneﬀective for Scedosporium spp. infections [7, 8].
Newer agents, such as voriconazole, have shown variable
results in the treatment of scedosporiosis [8] with a trend
toward improved survival when compared to amphotericin
B in some studies [7, 8]. In vitro, studies have shown a
synergistic action from the combination of terbinaﬁne and
voriconazole on S. proliﬁcans [10]. Overall the susceptibility
proﬁle for these two fungal agents is very diﬀerent and
antifungal therapy experience too small. Altogether, they
made therapeutic choice a diﬃcult challenge in the setting
of this case report. Finally the ﬁfth factor to be considered
is adjunctive therapies. These include hyperbaric oxygen
(HBO) therapy, iron chelation therapy, and immunotherapy
[5, 6, 29, 30]. HBO therapy seemed to improve survival
in patients with mucormycosis, provided they receive an
adequate course of antifungal therapy in a series of 28
patients. Almost all patients received amphotericin B and
major beneﬁt was seen for diabetic patients and for those
patients whose predisposing condition was rectiﬁed [5, 29].
Deferasirox iron chelation therapy has been reported to show
synergy with lipid polyenes against mucormycosis [5, 6, 30].
Although HBO is not worldwide available, deferasirox is a
feasible therapy. Interferon-γ and granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor have shown experimentally to
increase Mucorales hyphal damage by polymorphs though
Rhizopus sp. were found to be less susceptible to the host
response [5]. This kind of therapies holds promise although
experience with them is clearly preliminary and further
experimental and clinical studies are needed.
4. Conclusion
We are noticing a change among the proﬁle of the ﬁla-
mentous moulds responsible for IFIs in HSCT recipients.
Though unusual Rhizomucor and Scedosporium spp. IFIs
are highly lethal and may resemble IA in the clinical ﬁeld.
Prompt diagnosis and early aggressive surgery are key factors
to successful treatment of these emergent IFIs because
knowledge about their medical treatment is still largely
based on animal models, in vitro studies, and weak clinical
experience. Further research for speciﬁc/faster diagnostic
procedures, new antifungal drugs, and randomized clinical
trials are needed.
