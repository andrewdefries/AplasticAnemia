ABSTRACT
Telomerase is a specialized reverse transcriptase
that adds telomeric DNA repeats onto chromosome
termini. Here, we characterize a new telomerase-
specific motif, called motif 3, in the catalytic
domain of telomerase reverse transcriptase, that is
crucial for telomerase function and evolutionally
conserved between vertebrates and ciliates.
Comprehensive mutagenesis of motif 3 identified
mutations that remarkably increase the rate or
alter the processivity of telomere repeat addition.
Notably, the rate and processivity of repeat
addition are affected independently by separate
motif 3 mutations. The processive telomerase
action relies upon a template translocation mecha-
nism whereby the RNA template and the telomeric
DNA strand separate and realign between each
repeat synthesis. By analyzing the mutant tel-
omerases reconstituted in vitro and in cells, we
show that the hyperactive mutants exhibit higher
repeat addition rates and faster enzyme turnovers,
suggesting higher rates of strand-separation during
template translocation. In addition, the strong
correlation between the processivity of the motif 3
mutants and their ability to use an 8 nt DNA primer,
suggests that motif 3 facilitates realignment
between the telomeric DNA and the template RNA
following strand-separation. These findings support
motif 3 as a key determinant for telomerase activity
and processivity.
INTRODUCTION
Telomerase is a specialized reverse transcriptase (RT)
responsible for adding telomeric DNA repeats onto
the 30
-ends of chromosomes. Telomere elongation
counter-balances the natural shortening of linear chromo-
somes due to the end-replication problem, preventing
senescence, apoptosis and genome instability (1). The deﬁ-
ciency in telomerase function leads to limited renewal
capacity in highly proliferative cells, and is associated
with human diseases including dyskeratosis congenita,
aplastic anemia and idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis (2,3).
Reconstitution of catalytically active telomerase in vitro
requires two core components: the telomerase RNA (TR)
and the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) protein.
The TR contains a short template region for the synthesis
of telomeric DNA repeats, and conserved structural
domains essential to in vivo biogenesis and assembly
with the TERT protein. The TERT subunit is a multi-
domain protein comprised of an N-terminal extension
(NTE), a central catalytic RT domain and a C-terminal
extension (CTE) (4). In most eukaryotes, the NTE consists
of a TR binding domain and a telomerase-essential N-
terminal (TEN) domain that binds telomeric DNA (5).
However, the TEN domain is dispensable in certain
species, such as insects (6). The catalytic RT domain
encompasses seven essential motifs (1, 2, A, B, C, D
and E) that are universally conserved among RTs (7).
Telomerase has the unique ability to add multiple
telomeric repeats to a given primer before complete
dissociation from the DNA, called ‘repeat addition
processivity’ (abbreviated to ‘processivity’). Unlike con-
ventional RTs which can utilize a variety of single-
stranded RNA templates, telomerase uses only a short
sequence from its intrinsic RNA component as template.
During telomere DNA synthesis, the 30
-end of telomeric
DNA base pairs with the RNA template forming an
RNA/DNA duplex which is positioned within the
catalytic site of TERT protein for nucleotide addition.
When telomerase completes the synthesis of one telomeric
DNA repeat, a ‘template translocation’ must occur
whereby the RNA template dissociates from the DNA
strand, translocates and realigns relative to the 30
-end of
the DNA, providing an unoccupied template for the next

round of repeat synthesis. This translocation process is the
rate-limiting step in a processive telomerase reaction, as
indicated by the strong pause after each round of repeat
synthesis, giving rise to the characteristic ladder banding
pattern of telomere products (8,9). While the repeat
addition rate is determined by the rate-limiting tran-
slocation step, the processivity of the reaction is deter-
mined by the probability, or eﬃciency, of RNA/DNA
realignment over complete product release during
translocation.
The extent of telomerase processivity varies dramati-
cally among species. Telomerase from ciliates and most
vertebrates are highly processive (8–10). In contrast,
telomerase from certain rodents and yeasts have little to
no processivity (11–14). Reaction conditions and acces-
sory proteins appear to contribute to the disparity in
processivity observed in vitro (15–17). However, the intrin-
sic properties of TERT and TR components are by and
large the major determinants for the varying degrees of
processivity observed among species.
Mutations in both TERT and TR components have
been found to aﬀect the rate and processivity of the
telomerase reaction. Several elements within TERT were
shown to be crucial for telomerase processivity. The TEN
domain contains an ‘anchor site’ that binds single-
stranded telomeric DNA, preventing complete product
release from the enzyme during template translocation
(4,18). A recent study has shown that a mutation at
Leu14 in the Tetrahymena TEN domain abolished pro-
cessivity while leaving activity and DNA binding aﬃnity
intact. The Leu14 residue was proposed to function
as an intra-molecular switch for processivity (19). In
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a motif called insertion in
ﬁnger domain (IFD), located in the RT domain between
motifs A and B, contains four conserved residues shown
to be important for second repeat synthesis (20). Also
within the RT domain, a point mutation in motif C of
Tetrahymena TERT increases processivity by increasing
protein–DNA primer aﬃnity (21). Beyond the RT
domain, a mutation in the CTE, a putative homolog to
the HIV RT thumb, was shown to reduce repeat addition
processivity (22). Within the TR, the template length and
conserved structural elements also contribute to
telomerase processivity, through aﬀecting telomeric
DNA/template RNA base-pairing interactions during
template translocation (23,24) or the RNA/TERT
protein interactions (25,26). A previous study by
Drosopoulos et al. (27) showed that varying the
template sequence can alter the rate of telomere repeat
addition, possibly through modulating interactions
between the template RNA, DNA product and TERT
protein. Although the TERT protein was shown to con-
tribute to the processivity of telomerase activity, its
involvement in the regulation of telomere repeat
addition rate is unclear.
In this study, we carried out a comprehensive
alanine-substitution screening in a novel motif of the
TERT protein and discovered mutations that surprisingly
increased the rate or altered the processivity of telomere
repeat addition. Characterization of the in vitro reconsti-
tuted telomerase enzymes containing these unusual
hyperactive mutations indicates a higher rate of enzyme
turnover or product dissociation. In addition, mutations
that alter processivity alter the ability of the enzymes to
use the short 8 nt primer as substrate, the use of which
resembles the realignment of the 30
-end of DNA with
the template RNA—the second step of the template
translocation. We conclude that this novel TERT motif
is an important determinant for telomerase activity and
processivity, regulating both strand-separation and
realignment of telomeric DNA and template RNA
during template translocation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sequence alignment analysis
The sequence alignment of the RT domain for TERT and
other RTs was performed within the program BioEdit
using the ClustalW algorithm, and further reﬁned
manually using the highly conserved RT motifs as
anchor points. The alignment was carried out initially
for individual groups of closely related species, then
expanded to include sequences from more divergent
species. The complete sequence alignment is available at
the telomerase database (http://telomerase.asu.edu) (28).
Plasmid construction and mutagenesis
Speciﬁc mutations in the human TERT (hTERT) genes
were introduced into pNFLAG-hTERT (a generous gift
from Dr Vinayaka Prasad) by site-directed mutagenesis
using an overlapping PCR strategy (29). For in vivo
expression of TERT, gene fragments that contain speciﬁc
mutations were sub-cloned from pNFLAG-hTERT into
a modiﬁed pcDNA-hTERT vector (generous gifts from
Dr Joachim Lingner) via two SacII sites within the
TERT gene. Intended mutations were conﬁrmed by
sequencing.
Reconstitution of telomerase in vitro and in cells
Human telomerase was reconstituted in vitro using the
TNT Quick Coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system
(Promega) as described previously with minor modiﬁca-
tions (30). To assemble telomerase, 1 mM of human TR
(hTR) pseudoknot (nt 32–195) and CR4–CR5 (nt 239–
328) RNA fragments were added to the hTERT synthesis
reactions, and incubated at 30
C for 30 min.
To purify suﬃcient amount of mutant telomerase from
cells for telomerase direct assay, we used the telomerase
reconstitution system developed by Lingner’s group with
minor modiﬁcations (31,32). Recombinant telomerase
enzyme was reconstituted by over-expressing the hTERT
and hTR genes in 293FT cells (Invitrogen) using
pcDNA-hTERT and pBS-U1-hTR (generous gifts from
Dr Joachim Lingner) as described previously. Cells were
grown in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS at
37
C with 5% CO2. After reaching 80–90% conﬂuency,
cells were transfected with 1 mg of plasmid DNA (200 ng of
pcDNA-hTERT and 800 ng of pBS-U1-hTR diluted in
50 ml of FBS-free DMEM media) and 4 ml of Fugene
HD transfection reagent (Roche) in 12-well plates,
Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, No. 6 1983
following the manufacturer’s instruction. Two days post
transfection, cells were harvested and lysed (31).
Telomerase activity assay
Telomerase reconstituted in vitro or in cells was assayed
using the conventional direct primer-extension assay as
previously described (30), with the exception of that
0.165 mM of [a-32
P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer)
was used in a 10 ml reaction. Telomerase processivity was
determined by measuring the intensity of each major
band, normalized by the numbers of 32
P-dGTP incorpo-
rated and plotted versus the repeat numbers as previously
described (15). Processivity was calculated using the
equation: Processivity = Àln 2/(2.303k), where k is the
slope. The processivity of mutant telomerase was pre-
sented relative to the wild-type enzyme.
The pulse-chase time course experiments were carried
out using in vitro reconstituted telomerase and the conven-
tional direct assay as described above. The pulse-chase
assay tracks the progressive extension of telomere
products that were labeled (or pulsed) during the pulse
reaction and extended by the processive telomerase
enzymes during the chase reaction. During the pulse
reaction, the enzymes add telomere repeats to the DNA
primer with the incorporation of radioactive [a-32
P]dGTP.
In brief, telomerase was incubated with 4 mM (TTAGGG
)3 primer in the presence of 1 Â PE buﬀer (50 mM Tris–
HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT, 3 mM MgCl2 and
1 mM spermidine) at 30
C for 5 min to allow suﬃcient
primer–enzyme complex formation prior to the pulse
reaction. The pulse reaction was initiated by the
addition of 1 mM dATP, 1 mM dTTP, 2 mM dGTP and
0.33 mM a-32
P-dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer) and
incubated at 30
C for 5 min. The chase reaction was
then carried out by adding non-radioactive dGTP to
100 mM in the reaction and incubated at 30
C for
various amount of time as indicated. Upon addition of
50-fold excess non-radioactive dGTP, the initially
labeled telomere products continue to be extended in the
chase reaction by the same enzyme. During the chase
reaction, the primers extended by the enzymes dissociated
from the initially pulsed telomere products will not be
seen. The chase reaction was terminated by ethanol pre-
cipitation and analyzed by gel-electrophoresis. For each
chase reaction, 10 bands with highest intensity above
initial pulse product bands were used to deduce a
‘modal band’ and calculate the extension rate as
previously described (27). Because of the short extension
time, the processivity cannot be accurately measured
during the pulse reaction and the chase reactions at the
early time points. Instead, telomerase processivity in the
pulse-chase assay was determined from the ﬁrst ten major
bands (1–10 repeats added) in the chase reaction at the last
time point (10 min).
For the short-primer telomerase assay, diﬀerent
telomere primers tel8, tel10, tel12, tel15, tel18 were used
as indicated. For Km measurements, the primers were
supplied at varying concentrations and the reaction
mixture was incubated for 5–60 min, which falls in the
linear range of product formation. A 32
P-end-labeled
oligonucleotide (50 nt) was used as the recovery and
loading control. The product intensity of each reaction
was quantitated, normalized with loading control and
expressed as a relative activity compared to the reaction
with highest primer concentration. The relative activities
were plotted against primer concentration and the
Michaelis–Menten equation, Y = Vmax Â X/(Km + X),
was used to ﬁt the nonlinear curve to determine the Km
(Prism 5, Graphpad Software).
To measure enzyme turnover rate, the in vitro
reconstituted telomerase was pre-incubated with 10 mM
tel7 primer (50
-AGGGTTA-30
) in the presence of 1Â PE
buﬀer at 30
C for 10 min. Telomerase reaction was
initiated by addition of 2 mM dGTP and 0.33 mM
[a-32
P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer), and aliquots
were removed from the reaction mixture at diﬀerent time
points. The intensity of product was ﬁrst adjusted by the
TERT protein level, and normalized by the intensity of
loading controls. The intensity of each band was
normalized by that of the wild-type reaction at the last
time point (10 min). The relative product intensities were
then plotted against the amount of time. The slope of
linear trend line represents the enzyme turnover rate.
The enzyme turnover rates of mutant telomerases were
indicated as relative values to the wild-type enzyme.
Western blot analysis
Ten micrograms of total protein of 293FT cell lysate was
heated at 95
C for 5 min in 1 Â Laemmli buﬀer (0.125 M
Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5%
2-mercaptoethanol and 0.0025% bromophenol blue),
resolved on a 6 or 8% SDS–PAGE gel, and
electro-transferred onto the PVDF membrane. Blocking
(overnight at 4
C) and incubation with antibodies (1 h at
room temperature) were carried out in 5% nonfat milk/
1Â TTBS (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and
0.05% Tween 20). Anti-hTERT goat polyclonal antibody
L-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-GAPDH
mouse monoclonal antibody 6C5 (Ambion) were used as
the primary antibodies. After incubation with the HRP-
conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology), the blots were developed using the Immobilon
Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore),
and the blot images were acquired and analyzed using a
Gel Logic440 system (Kodak).
Northern blot analysis
Total RNA was extracted from transfected cells using
Tri-reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) following
manufacturer’s instruction. Three micrograms of total
RNA was resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide/8 M urea
denaturing gel and electro-transferred to the Hybond-
XL membrane (GE Healthcare). Preparation of the
riboprobes and hybridization of the blot were carried
out as described previously (9).
Homology modeling
The RNA–DNA duplex was modeled into the Tribolium
TERT structure (3DU6) by superimposition with the
HIV1 p66 structure (1HYS) containing an RNA/DNA

duplex. The two pdb ﬁles were superimposed in the CCP4
program using the following seven conserved resides
within the RT domain as anchor points: three Asp
residues in motifs A and C; Arg in motif 2; Glu and Gly
in motif B; and Gly in motif E. These seven residues are
highly conserved between TERTs and retroviral RTs.
RESULTS
Sequence conservation of motif 3
The novel motif 3, located in the catalytic RT domain of
TERT between motifs 2 and A (Figure 1A), was
previously found conserved in vertebrate and invertebrate
chordates (33). To determine the extent of conservation of
this motif in species beyond chordates, we extended the
sequence alignment analysis to include additional groups
of eukaryotes (detailed in ‘Materials and Methods’
section). Remarkably, the sequence of motif 3 is conserved
also in non-yeast fungi, plants and ciliates (Figure 1B).
The conservation of motif 3 sequences over a large evolu-
tionary distance, from vertebrates to ciliates, implies
necessity for telomerase function. Secondary-structure
prediction of the motif 3 sequences from a large number
of species suggested a putative helix–coil–helix fold
(Supplementary Figure S1A). Interestingly, the recent
crystal structure of TERT from an insect, Tribolium
castaneum, contains a helix–coil–helix structure between
motif 2 and A, supporting the secondary-structure predic-
tion (34). Despite the apparent similarity in predicted
secondary-structure, TERTs from insects, nematodes
and yeasts did not show the same degree of sequence con-
servation, particularly in the central region of motif 3
(Supplementary Figure S2). Previously in the RTs
closely related to the TERT, including the Penelope-like
retrotransposons, non-LTR retrotransposons and group
II introns, a conserved motif between motif 2 and A was
identiﬁed as motif 2a (35–37), which however shares no
common sequence to the TERT motif 3 (Supplementary
Figure S2). Since motif 3 appears conserved speciﬁcally in
vertebrates and ciliates whose telomerase is highly
processive, but not in yeasts whose telomerase is not
processive, we speculated that motif 3 might be important
for telomerase processivity.
Mutations in motif 3 aﬀect telomerase activity and
processivity independently
To experimentally determine the function of motif 3, we
conducted comprehensive alanine substitution mutagenesis
on human TERT and analyzed the telomerase mutants
reconstituted in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) for
activity and processivity (see ‘Materials and Methods’
section). Certain residues in motif 3 appear to be critical
for telomerase catalysis, as the alanine substitutions
W690A and F693A nearly abolished telomerase activity
(Figure 2A, lanes 38 and 42). This is not unexpected for
the F693 residue as it is one of the three most conserved
residues in motif 3 (Figure 1B). The W690 residue,
although not as highly conserved as F693, is naturally

(<30% light, 30–60% medium and >60% dark).

substituted with hydrophobic leucine or valine in most
species (Figure 1B).
An intriguing ﬁnding from analyzing these motif 3
mutants was that telomerase activity and processivity
can be independently altered (Figure 2). Three mutations
(V658A, K659A and R669A) in the N-terminal region of
motif 3 increased telomerase activity up to 1.7-fold, but
had diﬀerent eﬀects on processivity (Figure 2B). For
example, mutant V658A is hyperactive and hyper-
processive, compared to wild-type enzyme (Figure 2A,
lane 4). In contrast, hyperactive mutants K659A and
R669A had reduced processivity (Figure 2A, lanes 5
and 15). Unlike V658A, mutants E668A, D684A and
V697A showed greater processivity, but lower activity
(Figure 2B). Mutations L661A, N666A, R669A, L681A,
G682A and I686A, while all reduced processivity, altered
activity diﬀerently (Figure 2B). In summary, the analysis
of motif 3 mutants showed no correlation between
changes in activity and changes in processivity, suggest-
ing that telomerase activity and processivity are indepen-
dent and possibly regulated through separate mechanisms.
To determine if the telomerase mutants assembled
in vitro and in cells behave similarly, we assayed
two hypo-processive mutants (G682A and I686A) and
three hyper-processive mutants (E668A, D684A and
V697A). The mutant telomerases were reconstituted by
over-expressing the full-length hTR and mutant hTERT
genes in the 293FT cells to generate high telomerase
activity suﬃcient for direct telomerase assay, a system
developed by Cristofari and Lingner (31,32). The endog-
enous telomerase activity from 293FT cells transfected
with the empty vector was undetectable by the direct
primer-extension assay (Figure 3, lane 1). The telomerase
mutants reconstituted in RRL and in human cells
exhibited similar levels of activity and processivity
(Figure 3, lanes 7, 8, 16, 17 and 18), conﬁrming the
results from the in vitro reconstituted enzymes. Addi-
tionally, we rescued two nearly inactive alanine-
substituted mutants, L665A and F693A, with substitu-
tions of conservative amino acids L665I and F693Y
(Figure 3, compare lanes 10 to 11 and 12 to 13), suggesting
the bulky hydrophobic side-chains of these two residues
are required for telomerase function.
We also tested two disease-associating motif 3 muta-
tions, G682D and V694M, previously identiﬁed
in aplastic anemia patients (38,39). While both muta-
tions signiﬁcantly reduced telomerase activity (Figure 3,
lanes 9 and 20), the G682D mutation also caused a signiﬁ-
cant reduction in processivity (Figure 3, lane 20).
The reduced telomerase activity and processivtiy of the
disease-associating motif 3 mutants, together with the
shortened telomere length in the patients harboring
the mutations, support the importance of motif 3 for
telomerase function and telomere maintenance in vivo.
The length of N-terminal linker of motif 3 aﬀects
telomerase activity
Based on the sequence alignment, the upstream linker con-
necting motif 3 to 2 is more variable in length than the
downstream linker connecting motif 3 to A (Figure 1B).
To assess the functional importance of the motif 3
ﬂanking linkers, we generated TERT mutants with inser-
tions (i644AAA645 and i702KKK703) or deletions
(d643–649 and d699–701) in the linker regions and
assayed the in vivo reconstituted enzymes for telomerase
activity.
Both linker regions are more sensitive to deletions
than insertions. Insertions i644AAA645 (N-terminal
linker) and i702KKK703 (C-terminal linker) did not
signiﬁcantly decrease telomerase activity or processivity
(Figure 3, lanes 4 and 6). In contrast, deletions in the
linker regions caused dramatic alterations in telomerase
activity. The 3-residue deletion d699–701 in the
C-terminal linker 3/A nearly abolished activity
(Figure 3, lane 5). Surprisingly, a 7-residue deletion
d643–649 in the N-terminal linker increased activity by
nearly two-fold without signiﬁcant changes in processivity
(Figure 3, lane 3). The N-terminal linker appeared more
ﬂexible than of the C-terminus, as a 12-residue deletion in
the N-terminal linker did not aﬀect telomerase activity
(data not shown). Notably, the hyperactive alanine-
substitution mutations, V658A, K659A, R669A, are
located within the N-terminal portion of motif 3 near
the upstream linker, implicating a similar role for the
N-terminal linker and the N-terminal portion of motif 3
in regulating telomerase activity.
Hyperactive motif 3 mutants exhibit faster rates
of repeat addition
To determine if the greater activity observed within the
hyperactive mutants was due to faster repeat addition,
we carried out a pulse-chase time-course assay to
measure repeat addition rate. Our results demonstrate
that, regardless of their diﬀerences in processivity, the
hyperactive d643–649, V658A, K659A and R669A
mutants add telomere repeats at a faster rate of
5–6 repeats/min, higher than the wild-type enzyme,
3–4 repeats/min (Figure 4, lanes 7–32). Conversely, the
hypoactive mutants E668A, D684A and V697A present
slower repeat addition rates than the wild-type enzyme
(Figure 4, lanes 38–52). These results suggest a critical
role for motif 3 in regulating repeat addition rate of
telomerase enzyme.
The increase or decrease in repeat addition rate is inde-
pendent of the processivity level of the mutants. In the
pulse-chase assay, the extent of telomerase processivity
was measured at the last time point where the processive
enzyme–product complexes have already moved up to
the top of the gel and separated from the products disso-
ciated from the enzyme during the time course. While
the hyperactive V658A mutant was more processive, the
other two hyperactive mutants, K659A and R669A, were
less processive (Figure 4, compare lanes 17, 22, 27 and 32).
Moreover, by combining two motif 3 mutations
(d643–649 and V658A) and an hTR-57C template
mutation that increases processivity (23), we generated a
telomerase mutant that is super-active and super-
processive, demonstrating an additive eﬀect for these
mutations in telomerase activity and processivity
(Supplementary Figure S3, lane 6).

Low-processivity motif 3 mutants are defective in utilizing
short DNA primers
The motif 3 mutations that altered processivity presum-
ably aﬀected either the template realignment or product
release step of translocation, as telomerase processivity
correlates to the probability of template realignment
over product release. To determine if the low-processivity
mutations aﬀect the template realignment step, we
designed a short primer assay to analyze the ability of
telomerase to use short primers that, when base-pair
with the RNA template, leave no single-stranded
overhang for the TEN domain anchor site to bind
(Figure 5B). This assay thus discounts the eﬀect of
the TEN domain on substrate binding, as it binds to the
upstream single-stranded region of a longer telomeric
DNA primer (40). The base-pairing between the short
tel8 DNA primer and the template RNA resembles the
realignment of the 30
-end of telomeric DNA with the
RNA template during translocation. By using a short
primer, i.e. the 8-nt tel8 primer, in the telomerase assay,
we can then determine solely the contribution of motif 3 in
facilitating formation, or recognition, of the RNA/DNA
duplex inside the active site. Thus, a low-processivity
mutant with an inability to complete the realignment
step in a translocation cycle would be predicted unable
to use a short primer as substrate.

for activity. The TERT mutants d643-649 and d699-701 contain deletions of 7 and 3 residues, respectively. The TERT mutants i644AAA645 and
i702KKK703 contain insertions of three alanine residues and three lysine residues between 644–645 and 702–703, respectively. The TERT mutants
that contain diﬀerent amino acid substitutions at the same residue are indicated by brackets. Numbers on the right (+1, +2, +3 etc.) indicate the
number of repeats added to the telomeric primer. A 32
P-end-labeled 15-mer DNA oligonucleotide is used as a loading control (l.c.). Middle panel:
Expression level of hTERT protein in the transfected cells was analyzed by western blots of hTERT and GAPDH using anti-hTERT L-20 and
anti-GAPDH antibodies. The level of GAPDH was used as a loading control. Bottom panel: Expression level of hTR in the transfected cells was
analyzed by northern blots of hTR and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) using riboprobes against hTR or 5S rRNA. The level of 5S rRNA was used as a
loading control. The endogenous hTR is not visible in the vector-only sample (lane 1) due to the short exposure time. Quantitation of telomerase
activity and processivity of telomerase reconstituted in cells in relation to the wild-type TERT are shown below the gel (in vivo reconstituted
telomerase). Activity and processivity of telomerase mutants reconstituted in vitro analyzed in Figure 2 is shown at bottom for comparison
(in vitro reconstituted telomerase). n/d: not determined.

Using the short-primer assay, we tested six motif 3
mutants (V658A, N666A, L681A, G682A, D684A and
I686A) with either increased or decreased processivity.
In addition to motif 3, we also analyzed low-processivity
mutations that are located in other parts of TERT, or in
the TR component. Mutations N95A (TEN), L980A
(CTE), 790-VVIE-793-4A (IFD) and hTR-A55G (RNA
template) have been previously shown to reduce
telomerase processivity (20,22,23,41). The wild-type
telomerase can utilize all primers (8, 10, 12 or 18 nt)
tested with similar activity (Figure 5A, lanes 1–4).
Remarkably, the low-processivity mutants, N666A,
L681A, G682A, I686A, 790-VVIE-793-4A, L980A and
hTR-A55G, that can extend longer primers normally,
had little to no activity when using the short tel8 primer
(Figure 5A, lanes 13, 17, 21, 29, 33, 37 and 41). This
suggests these mutations compromised the ability of
TERT in promoting RNA/DNA duplex formation or
positioning the duplex into the active site for the ﬁrst
repeat synthesis. As would be expected, the
hyper-processive mutants V658A and D684A utilized the
short tel8 and the longer primers with equal eﬃciency
(Figure 5A, lanes 9 and 25). The TEN domain N95A
mutant, while having low processivity, can however
extend the short tel8 primers eﬃciently (Figure 5A,
lane 5). The TEN domain thus does not appear to play
a role in facilitating primer/template realignment, instead
preventing product release during template translocation
through DNA binding. When using tel10 and tel12
primers, all enzymes gave rise to stronger ﬁrst bands
(10 + 2 and 12 + 2) than the subsequent bands, indicat-
ing a lower eﬃciency for the ﬁrst translocation event

Figure 5. Activity assay of telomerase mutants using primers with various lengths. (A) Telomerases with speciﬁc mutations in TERT or TR indicated
were assayed for activity using telomere primers, tel8, tel10, tel12 or tel18, with length ranging from 8 to 18 nt. Due to the diﬀerence in overall
activity between mutants, the gel image of each mutant was adjusted to have similar intensity for better comparison of the products of diﬀerent
primers. The numbers (8 + 2, 10 + 2, 12 + 2, etc.) labeled on the right of the gel indicate the length of the primer plus the number of nucleotides
added. The black triangle on the left of the gel indicates the ﬁrst repeat product extended from the tel8 primer. (B) The four diﬀerent primers are

(Figure 5A). This phenomenon is also consistent with the
notion that TEN domain binding to the longer DNA
primer facilitates template translocation.
To quantitatively determine the ability of these
processivity mutants to utilize short primers as substrate,
we measured the Km of the wild-type and mutant enzymes
to the tel8 DNA primer. All mutants that failed to extend
the tel8 primer had higher Km values ranging from 2.76 to
5.31 mM, 5–10-fold higher than the 0.56 mM of the
wild-type enzyme (Figure 5C). In contrast, mutants that
retained the ability to extend the tel8 primer had Km
values similar to or lower than the wild-type enzyme.
For example, the most processive mutant D684A has a
Km of 0.33 mM, signiﬁcantly lower than that of the
wild-type (Figure 5C). Compared to tel8, primers tel10
and tel12 can still be used eﬃciently by the wild-type
and mutant enzymes, with Km ranging from 80 to
680 nM (Figure 5A and 5C). When the longer tel18
primer (18 nt) was used, the wild-type enzyme and all
mutants, with the exception of the TEN N95A mutant,
had similar Km values $100 nM (Figure 5C).
The hTR-A55G template mutation resulted in a
mismatch between the RNA template and the DNA
substrate (Figure 5B), leading to a high Km for the tel8
primer (Figure 5C) and lower processivity (Figure 5A,
lanes 41–44). The IFD motif, found ﬁrst in yeast, also
contributes to the repeat addition processivity (20).
Based on the sequence alignment, we divided the IFD
into three regions, termed IFD-a, -b and -c (see
Supplementary Figures S1B and S4). Our human IFD-b
mutant (790-VVIE-793-4A) causes a phenotype similar
to motif 3, CTE and the hTR template mutants, conﬁrm-
ing that IFD-b is indeed required for processivity (Figure
5A, lanes 33–36).
The TEN N95A mutant had a higher Km value of
0.16 mM to the 18 nt tel18 primer, presumably due to a
reduced binding aﬃnity to the 50
-end single-strand
region of the longer DNA primer (Figure 5C). This
supports that the TEN domain is a major contributor
for the overall substrate aﬃnity as proposed previously.
The strong correlation between the processivity and the
Km to the tel8 primer of the motif 3, IFD and CTE
mutants ascertain that these elements contribute to the
formation or positioning of an extendable RNA/DNA
duplex substrate in the active site.
Hyperactive telomerase mutants have higher enzyme
turnover rates
Since template translocation is the rate-limiting step in the
processive telomerase reactions, the increased repeat
addition rate observed with the hyperactive mutants
should result from a greater translocation rate. Strand-
separation between the telomeric DNA and the template
RNA is a crucial step of template translocation. Taking
advantage of the short primer assay, we asked if the hyper-
active mutants have a faster dissociation rate for extended
telomere product from the template, which resembles the
strand-separation step of template translocation. Since the
tel8 primer still gave rise to multiple repeats products,
indicating successful translocation events, we thus used
an even shorter tel7 DNA primer, 50
-AGGGTTA-30
(7-nt) and only dGTP in the reaction to prevent any
possible realignment of the telomeric DNA product with
the RNA template after one round of repeat synthesis.
Without the interference from TEN domain or other
DNA binding sites, this time-course assay focused primar-
ily on the rate of product dissociation from the active site.
Our results from this time-course analysis indicated that
all hyperactive mutants d643-649, V658A, K659A and
R669A have higher enzyme turnover rates than the
wild-type enzyme (Figure 6). The higher turnover rates
of these mutants were not due to higher substrate
binding aﬃnity, as these hyperactive mutants had a Km
higher or similar to that of the wild-type enzyme
(Figure 6B) and the reactions were performed at a satu-
rated substrate concentration of 10 mM (see ‘Materials and
Methods’ section). The high Km values of the hyperactive
mutants K659A and R669A were consistent with their low
processivity as shown above (Figures 4 and 6B). Con-
versely, the hypoactive mutants E668A, D684A and
V697A that showed lower repeat addition and template
translocation rates (Figure 4) had lower enzyme turnover
rates (Figure 6B). Together, these results suggest that the
increased template translocation rates of the hyperactive
motif 3 mutants are likely due to the higher dissociation
rates of products from the active site after each round of
repeat synthesis.
DISCUSSION
The repeat addition processivity of telomerase relies on a
unique template translocation mechanism that presum-
ably requires novel structural elements within the TERT
protein. The telomerase-speciﬁc motif 3 we characterized
in this study has been overlooked in the past, in part due
to the low degree of sequence conservation among
eukaryotic lineages, the presence of variable linkers and
the ineﬃciency of alignment algorithms (Figure 1 and
Supplementary Figure S2). In this study, through a com-
prehensive mutagenesis analysis within motif 3 (Figure 2),
we identiﬁed mutations that unusually increased the rate
or altered the processivity of telomere repeat addition
(Figures 3 and 4). By using a novel short-primer assay
to determine the binding aﬃnity of the mutants to short
DNA primers (Figure 5) and the time-course analysis to
measure enzyme turnover rates (Figure 6), we showed that
motif 3 mutations aﬀect repeat addition rate and
processivity, suggesting a crucial role for motif 3 in
strand-separation and realignment during template
translocation.
Our sequence alignment analysis and secondary-
structure prediction on motif 3 provide useful insights
into the function and evolution of this motif. The second-
ary structures of motif 3 predicted from diﬀerent TERT
homologs are surprisingly conserved (Supplementary
Figure S1A) and consistent with the crystal structure of
Tribolium castaneum TERT (34). The secondary-structure
prediction of TERT sequences from all available species
suggests that the motif 3 region consists of two a-helices
separated by a conserved linker (Supplementary

each telomerase enzyme, the intensity of products was adjusted with protein amount and normalized by the intensity of loading control. For each set

were then plotted against the amount of time. Wild-type (ﬁlled circle); d643–649 mutant (square); V658A (triangle); K659A (reverse triangle); R669A

trend lines in relation to that of the wild-type enzyme. The apparent Km values of diﬀerent telomerase mutants toward the tel7 primer were
determined by ﬁtting the data to Michaelis–Menten equation. The standard deviation was derived from three independent experiments.

Figure S1A and data not shown), consistent with the
Tribolium crystal structure. To display the physical
location of motif 3 in relation to other TERT domains
and the RNA/DNA duplex, we mapped the sequence of
the two putative a-helices of human motif 3 onto the
crystal structure Tribolium TERT based on the structural
and sequence homology. To speciﬁcally denote the diﬀer-
ent structural features, we divided motif 3 into three
sub-motifs, 3a, 3b and 3c, where 3a and 3c designate the
two separate a-helices and 3b designates the spanning
linker (Figure 7A). While the sequences of helices 3a and
3c are well conserved in most organisms, the sequence of
linker 3b is conserved most speciﬁcally within vertebrates,
non-yeast fungi, plants and ciliates (Figures 1B and 7A).
This group-speciﬁc sequence conservation of linker 3b
suggests a role important for telomerase function in
most species, yet dispensable and lost in species including
nematodes, insects and yeasts (Supplementary Figure S2).

signiﬁcant changes in telomerase activity or processivity,
mutations at the residues V664A, L676A and S679A
showed no dramatic changes (Figure 2B). It was
however expected that alanine substitutions do not
always give the same degree of eﬀects for all conserved
residues, due to unique structural and chemical properties
within various amino acids. Substitutions to amino acids
other than alanine will presumably produce diﬀerent
phenotypes.
The mutations (L681A, G682A and I686A) that
severely impair processivity are located in linker 3b
(Figures 2B and 7B, right), suggesting a primary role for
this linker in regulating the template translocation eﬃ-
ciency and repeat addition processivity. In comparison,
mutations (d643–649, V658A, K659A and R669A) that
signiﬁcantly increase telomerase activity are located in
the helix 3a and its N-terminal linker (Figure 7B, left),
suggesting that helix 3a is more important in regulating
the rate of template translocation and repeat addition.
However, helix 3a might play an additional role in
telomerase processivity as several mutations (V658A,
L661A, N666A, E668A and R669A) in motif 3a also sub-
stantially altered processivity.
The role of motif 3 on repeat addition rate
The three mutations in motif 3a, V658A, K659A and
R669A, and the deletion d643–649 in N-terminal linker
of motif 3a remarkably increased the repeat addition
rate (Figure 4), presumably due to an increase in
template translocation rate. This increase in repeat
addition rate is independent of the processivity, as some
hyperactive mutants have decreased processivity
(Figure 4). The combination of a high addition-rate
mutation with a low-processivity mutation did not
reduce the repeat addition rate of the enzyme (data not
shown), supporting that the rate and processivity of
telomerase are regulated separately, as previously
proposed (27).
The higher enzyme turnover rates measured in the
non-processive short primer assay suggest faster product
dissociation (or strand-separation) for the motif 3 hyper-
active mutants (Figure 6), assuming that the product dis-
sociation is the rate-limiting step. This is consistent with
the observation of the hyperactive mutants showing faster
template translocation in the processive pulse-chase assay,
in which the translocation is the rate-limiting step
(Figure 4). We propose that the putative helix 3a and its
N-terminal linker regulate the strand-separation step of
template translocation and thus modulate the rate of
repeat addition. It remains unclear if the strand-separation
of the RNA/DNA hybrid involves a conformational
change to helix 3a or its N-terminal linker. We hypothe-
size that the long N-terminal linker could function in
allowing helix 3a to swing away from the active site, per-
mitting the RNA/DNA duplex to dissociate from the
active site and the two strands to separate from each
other (Figure 7B). A source of energy for such a
conformational change could originate from the
movement and distortion of DNA/RNA duplex during
repeat synthesis as previously proposed (42).
The role of motif 3 on repeat addition processivity
Mutations at conserved residues within motif 3, the CTE
and the IFD of TERT as well as the template region of TR
aﬀected telomerase processivity and the ability to use
short telomere primers (Figures 5 and 6). The retained
ability of the wild-type enzyme to extend the short tel7
and tel8 primers indicates that the catalytic core of
TERT protein alone is capable of promoting the forma-
tion of, or recognizing, the RNA/DNA duplex substrate
inside the active site independent of the TEN domain. The
ability of telomerase to use the short primer correlates to
the processivity of repeat addition as it resembles the
second step of the translocation event, where the RNA
and DNA realign to form the hetero-duplex inside the
active site for the next round of repeat synthesis. The
fact that the TEN N95A mutant can eﬃciently elongate
the tel8 primer is consistent with the notion that this TEN
mutation impairs the binding to the upstream
single-stranded region of telomeric DNA primer, repre-
senting a diﬀerent mechanism to aﬀect telomerase
processivity.
It was however unexpected that the wild-type enzyme
would be capable of adding more than one telomere
repeats to the 8-nt DNA primer in the absence of
upstream single-stranded sequence for TEN binding
(Figure 5A, lane 1). The synthesis of multiple repeats indi-
cates the occurrence of template translocation after the
synthesis of the ﬁrst repeat. Although the tel8 primer
does not initially leave a single-stranded overhang when
base-paired with the RNA template, it would potentially
have the 50
-end unpaired from the template during cycles
of nucleotide addition, while maintaining a constant
number of base-pairings between the telomeric DNA
and the template RNA, as previously proposed (43).
Since the TEN domain requires a longer single-stranded
DNA overhang for binding, a more adjacent DNA
binding site (the template-proximal anchor site) in the
RT domain would thus seem responsible for binding the
partially unpaired 50
-end of the short tel8 DNA primer
(41,44).
Our results suggest that motif 3, CTE and IFD contrib-
ute to the realignment of telomeric DNA and the RNA
template, i.e. the reformation of RNA/DNA duplex. In
support of this notion, the crystal structure of Tribolium
TERT shows that these three motifs are located adjacent
to the RNA/DNA duplex, forming a horseshoe shaped
structure encircling the duplex (Figure 7B). The majority
of the motif 3 mutations that severely impaired the
enzyme’s processivity and short primer usage are located
in linker 3b (Figure 7). We envision the conserved motif
3b would act as a molecular hinge, positioning helix 3a
and the CTE to facilitate the RNA/DNA duplex forma-
tion or positioning the duplex within the active site
(Figure 7B). Since motif 3b is not conserved in insects, a
crystal structure of a vertebrate or ciliate TERT would be
necessary to elucidate the structural and functional
purpose of motif 3b in template translocation.
Our phylogenetic and biochemical studies of motif 3
shed light upon the molecular mechanism of the
translocation process for the processive telomerase

reaction. The implication of our data provides testable
hypotheses and elicits critical questions for future studies
of telomerase action. Moreover, our hyperactive and
hyper-processive motif 3 mutants demonstrate the feasi-
bility of enhancing telomerase enzymatic activity through
motif 3 targeting. Altering telomerase function can
possibly aﬀect the proliferative capacity of adult stem
cells. Drugs that augment enzymatic activity and
processivity of telomerase, similar to our mutants, might
provide treatments for patients suﬀering from telomerase-
insuﬃciency diseases. Additionally, the abated telomerase
motif 3 mutants provide potential drug target locals for
anti-cancer therapies.
