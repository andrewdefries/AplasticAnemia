Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in Western
society today. There is a striking gender difference in CVD with men predisposed to earlier
onset and more severe disease. Following the recent reevaluation and ongoing debate regard-
ing the estrogen protection hypothesis, and given that androgen use and abuse is increasing in
our society, the alternate view that androgens may promote CVD in men is assuming increas-
ing importance. Whether androgens adversely affect CVD in either men or women remains a
contentious issue within both the cardiovascular and endocrinological fraternities. This review
draws from basic science, animal and clinical studies to outline our current understanding
regarding androgen effects on atherosclerosis, the major CVD, and asks where future directions
of atherosclerosis-related androgen research may lie.
Introduction
Epidemiological studies have shown there is a striking gender difference in cardio-
vascular disease (CVD) with men having higher rates of clinical events than women
(Kalin and Zumoff 1999). These ﬁndings, together with the increased incidence of
CAD in women after menopause (Tracy 1966), have led to the dogma that female
hormones protect against the development of CVD (Jeanes et al 2007). The opposite
hypothesis, that male hormones may promote CVD in men, has been little inves-
tigated. With prospects of androgens being introduced widely for non-classical
therapeutic applications, an important clinical question is: do androgens increase
the risk or severity of CVD? Such androgen therapy is being targeted towards our
aging population, a population that would have pre-existing CVD. The recent pro-
posal that stems from the female hormone replacement therapy (HRT) studies is that
HRT appears beneﬁcial in females only when it is initiated before the development
of signiﬁcant atherosclerosis (Rossouw et al 2007). Whether this is also true for
androgen-based therapies is unknown. This review explores what is known about
androgens and their gender-speciﬁc effects on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis
to try and highlight those questions that need to be answered for the safe use of
androgen-based HRT in both men and women.
Risk factors of atherosclerosis
Primary risk factors for atherosclerosis include elevated levels of low-density lipo-
protein (LDL), increased levels of homocysteine, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
obesity, smoking, increasing age and also male gender (Ross 1999). In all developed
countries, men have an earlier and greater incidence of heart disease than women (Liu
et al 2003; Wu and von Eckardstein 2003; Isidori et al 2005). This may be one of the
oldest clues to the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of atherosclerosis and suggests
that gender-related differences between men and women drives, at least in part, the
disparate atherosclerotic plaque formation (Liu et al 2003). There remains no clear
Vascular Health and Risk Management 2008:4(1)12
McGrath et al
evidence, to date, that there is a genetic contribution to the
male predisposition to atherosclerosis, however the andro-
genic milieu may underlie plaque formation in men.
Molecular mechanisms of androgen
action
The molecular machinery mediating cellular responses to
androgens is complex and involves both genomic and nonge-
nomic effects that are still far from being clearly understood
(Figure 1). Genomic effects of androgens are mediated by a
speciﬁc receptor, the androgen receptor (AR). In response
to the binding of androgens to AR, it switches to a transcrip-
tion factor that regulates target gene expression (Davison
and Bell 2006). Non-genomic effects of androgens occur
independently of AR. Instead, membrane-bound receptors
have been proposed to trigger rapid effects of androgens that
lead to 2nd messenger signaling (Benton et al 2004). This,
in turn, triggers a variety of cell responses (Wierman 2007).
These nongenomic pathways underlie the rapid vasodila-
tion of coronary arteries by testosterone (Malkin et al 2006;
Cooper et al 2007; Seyrek et al 2007).
Regulation and tissue expression
of AR
AR function and transactivation ability is regulated by post-
translational modiﬁcations such as phosphorylation (Zhou
et al 1995; Gioeli et al 2002), acetylation and sumoylation
(Thomas et al 2004). AR expression itself is regulated at both
the mRNA and protein levels by androgens (Lee and Chang
2002). Androgens predominantly decrease AR mRNA at

the transcriptional level (Trapman et al 1990; Krongrad et al
1991) however, they simultaneously increase AR stability
and translational efﬁciency thereby even in the presence of
decreased AR mRNA levels, androgens increase AR protein
levels in most cell types (Yeap et al 1999).
AR has been detected in the majority of tissues throughout

derived macrophages (Ng et al 2003), endothelial cells (Death
et al 2004) and vascular tissue (Death et al 2004), where cells
or tissue from male donors had signiﬁcantly higher AR protein
levels. The gender dichotomy in AR expression may underlie
gender-speciﬁc effects of androgens on atherosclerosis.
Metabolic activation of testosterone
Testosteroneandotherandrogenscanmediateeffectsviameta-
bolic activation (Figure 2). This involves the conversion of
testosterone at peripheral nongonadal tissues to active metabo-
lites, estradiol or DHT. Conversion of testosterone to estradiol
involves a P450-dependent aromatase enzyme (CYP19) and
acts to diversify androgen action, since estradiol binds to the
estrogen receptor (ER), and not AR, thereby regulating the
expression of a completely different set of genes. The conver-
sion of testosterone to DHT is catalyzed by 5α-reductases.
DHT has greater binding afﬁnity for AR than testosterone and
a slower dissociation rate, therefore has a higher molar potency
(Grino et al 1990). Hence, the conversion of testosterone to
DHT effectively ampliﬁes AR action.
Androgens and vascular cell effects
Androgens have been shown to promote-, and suppress-,
pro-atherogenic, pro-inﬂammatory effects on all cell types
involved in atherogenesis. Given current evidence it would
appear that androgen effects are dependent on cell type,
dose, type of androgen, and time of exposure. For example,
T suppresses vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)
expression in human endothelial cells, via an aromatase/
estrogen receptor-dependent mechanism (Hatakeyama et al
2002; Mukherjee et al 2002); however, DHT, a non-aroma-
tisable androgen, induces VCAM-1 expression in human
endothelial cells (Death et al 2004). Similarly, T has been
shown to enhance reverse cholesterol transport (Langer et al
2002) whilst DHT promotes cholesteryl ester accumula-
tion in monocyte derived macrophages (Ng et al 2003). In
addition, T has been shown to inhibit nitric oxide release
from monocytes via inhibition of inducible nitric oxide
synthase (Friedl et al 2000). This decrease in NO potentially
increases thrombosis risk via increased platelet aggregation.
Additionally, T has adverse effects stimulating the prolif-
eration of rat vascular smooth muscle cells (Fujimoto et al
1994), inducing proteoglycan synthesis and the elongation of
glycosaminoglycans (GAG) chains on these proteoglycans
(Hashimura et al 2005) and T increases apoptotic damage of
vascular smooth muscle cells (Ling et al 2004). Importantly,
some of the effects on both endothelial cells and MDMs
were gender-speciﬁc, occurring in cells derived from males
but not females, and associated with increased AR expres-
sion in male-derived cells (Ng et al 2003; Death et al 2004).
This suggests that steps in atherogenesis could be markedly
different between genders, mediated by androgen exposure
and AR expression levels.
Therefore, both T and DHT can have effects that could
lead to the development of atherosclerosis, associated with
male-dependent AR expression. However, T can have equally
anti-atherogenic effects, associated with aromatisation. Obvi-
ously, more work is required for us to understand how andro-
gens act at the cellular level. One of the major questions that
has recently emerged is whether aromatisation is an important
protective mechanism? There is now a real need to study and
understand the metabolic activation pathways of T, in those
cell types associated with atherosclerosis, and to determine
if manipulating those pathways can switch between the ath-
eroprotective versus atherogenic effects of T?
Androgens and atherosclerosis:
evidence from animal model studies
As with the cellular studies, androgen treatment has been
shown to both promote and retard lesion formation in ani-
mal studies of atherosclerosis (Table 1). The effects of T
appear to be gender-, steroid/dose/administration-, and/or
species- speciﬁc. For the most part, T treatment of male
animals has led to a decrease in atherosclerotic lesion size
or the atherosclerosis-related end point studied (e.g. aortic
cholesterol content) (Bruck et al 1997; Elhage et al 1997;
Alexandersen et al 1999; Nathan et al 2001). Similarly,
DHEA treatment of male animals has led to a decrease in
atherosclerosis (Gordon et al 1988; Arad et al 1989; Eich
et al 1993). Both T and DHEA are readily aromatisable to
estradiol, and aromatase inhibition has been shown to block
the atheroprotective effects of T (Nathan et al 2001). In
keeping with the importance of aromatase to mediate the
atheroprotective effects of T, a study showed that a 3-month
treatment with an anabolic androgenic steroid, stanozolol,
had no effect on atherosclerosis or blood lipids in choles-
terol-fed rabbits (Fogelberg et al 1990). Stanozolol is a
5α-reduced substrate so it cannot be converted to estrogen
Vascular Health and Risk Management 2008:4(1)14
McGrath et al
by aromatase and therefore, only has androgenic effects.
Interestingly, 2/10 stanozolol-treated normal diet fed rabbits
developed atherosclerosis versus 0/72 control rabbits, thereby
suggesting that stanozolol may increase the propensity for
atherosclerotic lesion development. This was not followed
up by these investigators.
In contrast to the studies that showed T was atheroprotec-
tive, two studies (out of 12) demonstrated increased athero-
sclerotic plaque formation after exogenous T treatment (Toda
et al 1984; von Dehn et al 2001). However, both of these
studies used an experimental approach that differed from
usual practice. The ﬁrst studied chicks, rather than rodents,
and they only observed increased atherosclerotic lesion when
T was administered at 150 mg for 7 weeks (compared to 50
mg/day/rabbit for 3 months, Bruck et al 1997). No studies
have subsequently been performed in chicks to conﬁrm the
original ﬁndings. The second study demonstrating adverse
effects of T used chemical, rather than surgical, castration
of apoE-deﬁcient mice. In this model, T treatment (35 mg
dosage) was observed to increase atherosclerotic lesion area
by a signiﬁcant, but small, extent. This study did not examine
the aromatase pathway so in this animal model it is not clear

sent the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH). LH serves to stimulate the testis to
produce testosterone (T) or FSH stimulates production of inhibin. In turn, these exert a negative feedback on both the pituitary and hypothalamus regulating LH and FSH
secretion.T can be reduced to the more active dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or aromatised to estradiol (E2) in target tissues. (WOMEN) The hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian
and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis represents the major sources for androgen synthesis in women. In addition to inhibin and cortisol, high levels of E2, progesterone
(P) and adrenal androgens exert a negative feedback to regulate the secretions of GnRH, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), FSH, LH and adrenocorticotropic hor-
mone (ACTH).

if aromatase would be expressed, which could help explain
the disparate result.
As with the male animal model data, testosterone effects
on atherosclerotic plaque formation in female animal models
is also contentious. The data that exists is very limited with
only 5 studies in total. Three of these studies were performed
in rodents and testosterone was found to decrease lesion size
in 2/3 of them (Elhage et al 1997; von Dehn et al 2001). The
third rodent study showed no effect of testosterone treat-
ment on atherosclerotic plaque development (Chen et al
1996). The other two female animal studies were performed
with primates and showed that testosterone or the anabolic
androgen, nandrolone, induced atherosclerosis over a 2-year
treatment period (Adams et al 1995; Obasanjo et al 1996).
These primate studies, whilst only have a small number of
animals in the experimental groups, remains the strongest
evidence that exogenous androgen treatment may be ath-
erogenic in females.
Importantly, all of the animal studies have targeted the
effects of androgens on atherosclerotic plaque development
without examining an effect of T on existing plaque. As has
now been highlighted by the recent estrogen therapy trials,
the timing of hormone therapies can have different outcomes
on CVD. Although contentious, and remains to be proven,
estrogen-based therapies given after plaque has developed
leads to adverse effects (increased myocardial infarction,
stroke) in the short-term. Whether androgen-based therapies
have similar outcomes dependent on timing and age of patient
has not been investigated.
Figure 3 summarizes the primary effect of androgen and
estrogen treatment on atherosclerotic lesion development, as
measured in animal studies. Note that many more studies have
targeted estradiol effects and the number of androgen studies
are relatively small in comparison, especially those that focus
on T effects in females. Therefore, it remains unclear whether
T is anti- or pro-atherogenic in female animal models, whilst
in males T is atheroprotective, most probably via aromatisa-
tion to estradiol. Direct T or stanozolol effects appear to be
atherogenic, although the limited number of studies do not
allow for any ﬁrm conclusions to be made. Therefore, andro-
gens, atherosclerosis, and gender-speciﬁc effects remains an
important area for future research development.
Androgens and atherosclerosis:
evidence from clinical studies
To date, the major clue that androgens may drive CAD in
men remains the gender dichotomy in the earlier incidence
of atherosclerosis. However, epidemiologic studies report no
association between high physiologic androgen levels and
atherosclerosis (English et al 2000; Hak et al 2002; Muller
et al 2004). Instead, the inverse has been reported namely
that hypoandrogenemia associates with CAD (Malkin
et al 2003), or an atherogenic lipid proﬁle (Tchernof et al
1997; Zmuda et al 1997), metabolic syndrome (Kupelian
et al 2006), type 2 diabetes (Haffner et al 1996; Stellato
et al 2000), systolic and diastolic hypertension (Svartberg
et al 2004), visceral obesity (Khaw and Barrett-Connor
1992), increased ﬁbrinogen (Bonithon-Kopp et al 1988),
arterial stiffness (Hougaku et al 2006) and all-cause or
cardiovascular deaths (Barrett-Connor and Khaw 1988).
Hypoandrogenemia is common and it has been reported
that 10% of men between 40 and 60 years of age and 25%
between 60 and 80 years of age have low levels of free T
(Vermeulen and Kaufman 2002) therefore hypo- rather than
hyper- androgenemia may be the gender-speciﬁc factor driv-
ing atherosclerosis. However, not all studies have found an
association between hypoandrogenemia and increased CVD
(Contoreggi et al 1990) therefore it is difﬁcult to draw any
ﬁrm conclusions. It is of interest that castration of male
rodents has been shown to increase atherosclerosis in animal
models of atherosclerosis (Nathan et al 2001).
Given that low T levels appear harmful for CVD and
its important risk factors, T supplementation would be
expected to be beneﬁcial. Meta-analysis review of car-
diovascular safety of T replacement therapy has reported
that T supplementation was relatively safe in terms of
cardiovascular health (Haddad et al 2007). However, this
meta-analysis needs to be interpreted with caution as none
of the randomized controlled trials that were included in the
analysis were designed to assess cardiovascular safety and
therefore adverse outcomes may have been censored and/or
not reported, therefore, weakening the meta-analysis conclu-
sions. However, other studies have shown that T replacement
therapy has demonstrable beneﬁcial effects on CVD risk
factors, including waist measurements (Marin et al 1992),
visceral abdominal fat mass (Marin et al 1992), as well as
positive effects on numerous metabolic parameters includ-
ing insulin sensitivity, glucose control, and hyperlipidemia
(English et al 2000; Malkin et al 2006). Direct effects on
the arterial tree have also been described with consistent
improvement in both anginal symptoms and ischemia on
electrocardiograms in men treated with injectable T prepa-
rations (Rosano et al 1990; Webb et al 1999; English et al
2000; Pugh et al 2003).
However, while the observations above would suggest T
supplementation improves CVD risk factors, meta-analysis
Vascular Health and Risk Management 2008:4(1) 17
Androgen therapy and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
by Whitsel et al (2001) found a dose-dependent decrease in
HDL-C and total cholesterol levels with T use in hypogondal
men. Similarly, small intervention trials have demonstrated
that exogenous T supplementation in young men lowers HDL
(Meriggiola et al 1995; Wu et al 1996) but in older men T
did not affect HDL (Snyder et al 2001; Page et al 2005). The
disparite ﬁndings may indicate that the effect of T replace-
ment on HDL may be age-dependent. Any effect of T on
lowering HDL-C needs to be considered as low HDL levels
are a strong risk factor for CVD (Gordon et al 1997).
Other cardiovascular diseases that often coexist with
CVD, including hypertension and ischemic stroke, also show
a similar gender bias, with males at higher risk. Androgens
have been reported to adversely affect both conditions,
with reports of prohypertensive effects (Jenkins et al 1994;
Reckelhoff 2005) and to worsen the acute phase of stroke
(Hawk et al 1998). Therefore, when considering T replace-
ment therapy in aging men, the effect on atherosclerosis
cannot be considered without simultaneously investigating
hypertension and stroke (Figure 4).
Anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) use has been anec-
dotally associated with various forms of cardiovascular
disease. Self-administration of AAS has been linked with
sudden cardiac death, androgen-induced vasospasm, platelet

aggregation, activation of the coagulation cascade, and
abnormal left ventricular function and hypertrophy (Maron
et al 1996). It has also been reported that self-administration
of several AAS simultaneously for 8 or 14 weeks produces
profound unfavorable effects on lipoproteins and lipids,
leading to an increased atherogenic proﬁle (Hartgens et al
2004). However, any link between the adverse lipid proﬁle
induced by AAS use and increased atherosclerosis remains
to be established.
In women, it is much clearer that androgen excess is
linked to the burden of CVD risk factors. The most well
studied of such risk factors is insulin resistance. It has been
hypothesized that insulin resistance is a consequence of
androgen effects. Excessive androgenic steroid exposure of
female rats (Holmang et al 1990), normal females (Polder-
man et al 1994), transsexual females (Bjorntorp 1993), and
patients with aplastic anemia (Woodard et al 1981) can lead
to insulin resistance and may at least be partly reversed by
estrogen administration (Andersson et al 1997). In keeping
with this hypothesis, it was recently demonstrated that post-
menopausal women with well-controlled type 2 diabetes
that are insulin resistant show evidence of biochemical and
clinical androgen excess, compared to non-diabetic, post-
menopausal women with no known risk factors for diabetes
other than obesity (Korytkowski et al 2005). Further evidence
of a link between high androgen levels and CVD or CVD
risk factors is observed in women with polycystic ovary
syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS have a sustained
exposure to high physiologic androgen levels. This condition
is associated with endothelial dysfunction, obesity and meta-
bolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance and dyslipidae-
mia, all of which may predispose PCOS women to premature
atherosclerosis (Paradisi et al 2001; Krentz et al 2007).
However, despite the association between excess andro-
gen in women and insulin resistance, CVD risk factors and
angiographical evidence of atherosclerosis, there remains
no evidence of increase cardiovascular mortality in these
women. Additionally, in female-to-male transsexuals, testos-
terone therapy has not been linked to excess cardiovascular
mortality or morbidity (van Kesteren et al 1997). Therefore,
the question of the cardiovascular safety of androgen therapy
in women remains unanswered. Based on existing observa-
tions, androgen use may increase insulin resistance in women
with a consequent sequalae of cardiovascular effects however
apart from the observations in women with PCOS and type
2 diabetes, and animal data suggesting androgens promote
atherosclerosis in females, there is no solid data to support
the claim (Figure 4). More work is necessary to establish a
real link between androgens, insulin resistance and athero-
sclerosis in women.
Summary
From our current understanding of the effects of androgens
on atherosclerosis, it has become apparent that the view
androgens are harmful is too simplistic. This is made most
evident by the erratic nature of the ﬁndings reported in cel-
lular, animal and clinical studies. Clearly, much more work
is needed in both the basic science and clinical arenas to

Androgen therapy and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
fully elucidate the effects of androgens on the development
of atherosclerosis. For men, exogenous T treatment appears
largely beneﬁcial, at least in part via aromatization of T to
estradiol, especially if physiological T levels are deﬁcient.
However, self-administered AAS usage remains a major
CVD safety concern, especially given reported adverse
lipid proﬁle effects. As clinicians consider the use of T in
management of symptoms associated with the aging male,
there remains inconsistent and poorly reported data on car-
diovascular risk of long-term T use. For T treatment in aging
women, the current data would suggest androgen excess has
adverse effects on CVD risk factors, especially in women
with diabetes. In summary, there remains limited knowledge
about exogenous androgen treatments in both men and
women. Despite this, androgen use and abuse is increasing
in our society, either for therapeutic or recreational reasons.
Whether androgens adversely affect CVD in either men or
women remains a contentious issue that is in desperate need
of more research.
