SUMMARY
The Beckman Coulter UniCelÒ
DxH 800 is a hematology analyzer
incorporating new electronic and mechanical design with advanced
algorithm technology to perform CBC, white blood cell (WBC)
differential, nucleated red blood cell (NRBC), and reticulocyte analysis.
Evaluation of this instrument was performed in our 800-bed tertiary
care hospital and specifically centered upon the correlation of WBC,
NRBC, and platelet (PLT) enumeration when compared to a predicate
analyzer, the CoulterÒ
LH 780, and flow cytometry (FCM) reference
methods. Of particular interest were those samples with morpholog-
ically confirmed interference and extreme leukocytosis (evaluated with
respect to red blood cell parameter correction). The sample set
(n = 272) consisted of morphologically normal and hematologically
abnormal patients. Correlation of the WBC, PLT, and NRBC showed r2
values of 0.994, 0.985, and 0.910 for the DxH 800 vs. FCM,
respectively. The presence of interfering particles did not affect the
accuracy of the DxH 800 with respect to WBC counts. The DxH 800
showed accurate PLT and NRBC counts in the clinically signiﬁcant low
range when compared to FCM. Compared to the LH 780, ﬂagging rates
were signiﬁcantly reduced (NRBC ﬂag), or equivalent (WBC, PLT ﬂag)
on the DxH 800. The DxH 800 demonstrated higher sensitivity and
speciﬁcity for PLTs and NRBCs and achieved a lower NRBC false
negative rate compared to the LH 780. The UniCelÒ
DxH 800
represents a significant improvement to previous impedance analyzers
in accurately detecting the presence of NRBCs at counts >1/100 WBC.
Furthermore, it provides accurate PLT and WBC counts in the presence
of interference and improved NRBC flagging efficiency when compared
to the LH 780. Correction of red blood cell parameters is appropriate
and accurate in cases of extreme leukocytosis.

International Journal of Laboratory Hematology
The Ofﬁcial journal of the International Society for Laboratory Hematology
nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) is an important and
often challenging aspect of the complete blood count
(CBC). Conﬁrmation of accuracy of any of these
parameters is time-consuming, costly, and the delay
in reporting may have a negative impact on patient
management. The new Beckman Coulter UniCelÒ
DxH 800 CoulterÒ
Cellular Analysis System (DxH 800;
Miami, FL, USA) complete blood cell counter com-
bines advanced hardware technology, innovative
computer algorithms, impedance technology, ﬂow cell
volume, conductivity, and ﬁve light scatter measure-
ments to analyze PLTs, WBCs, and NRBCs. These
technologies integrate to deﬁne a new and more accu-
rate ‘signature position’ occupied by NRBCs as well as
to identify discrete WBC populations and common
cellular interferences. This data analysis is performed
as part of every routine CBC and WBC differential
without the need for additional reagent.
Highly accurate automated WBC, PLT, and NRBC
counts, especially in the presence of interference, has
a large impact in the operational efﬁciency of the
hematology laboratory (Schwartz & Stansbury, 1954;
Fernandez et al., 2001; La Porta, Bowden & Barr,
2002; Bourner, Dhaliwal & Sumner, 2005; Harrison
et al., 2005; Segal et al., 2005; Bodey, 2009). The pres-
ence of interfering particles in automated blood cell
enumeration often triggers a ‘ﬂag’ for manual review.
Although ﬂags are helpful and results in ﬁlm review,
this ﬂagging is often not sensitive enough (resulting
in false negatives) or misidentiﬁes other cellular types
(resulting in false positives) (Brown et al., 2001; Chin-
Yee et al., 2001, 2002; Keeney, Brown & Chin-Yee,
2001; Muller et al., 2006; Ghys, Malfait & J, 2009).
Inaccurate automated enumeration of any parameter
involves the traditional labor-intensive process of
manually inspecting and assessing a peripheral blood
ﬁlm for each of these parameters. Therefore, technolo-
gies that reﬁne automated cell counting so that ﬂag-
ging rates are reduced (by increasing speciﬁcity and
sensitivity) to those samples which absolutely require
manual inspection have the potential to signiﬁcantly
improve workload and turn around times. The goal of
this study was to evaluate the new Beckman Coulter
UniCelÒ
DxH 800 cellular analysis system centered
upon correlation of WBC, NRBC, and PLT enumera-
tion when compared to a predicate analyzer, the
CoulterÒ
LH 780, and ﬂow cytometry (FCM) refer-
ence methods.
The protocols and methodologies used in this eval-
uation were those of the International Committee for
Standardization in Hematology (ICSH) and the Clini-
cal Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) for reference
differential counts and the evaluation of instrument
methods (ISLH 1994; Richardson Jones et al., 1996;
Koepke et al., 2007).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Evaluation and validation of the DxH 800 cellular
analysis system (with software version 1.0.0) was car-
ried out in our hospital laboratory, an 800-bed tertiary
care hospital with over 700 000 inpatient, outpatient,
and emergency visits annually. The hospital provides
services for a large region and includes specialized
services such as critical care/trauma, cardiology,
neurology, cancer care, and transplant (solid and
hematopoietic) medicine.
Specimens
A total of 272 specimens (including morphologically
normal and hematological abnormal specimens) were
analyzed. All samples were anticoagulated with
K2EDTA and were spent routine hematology clinical
samples. Samples were stored at room temperature
and tested within 8 h of collection. All samples were
run initially on the LH 780 in the CDR mode (primary
aspiration), followed by similar testing on the compar-
ator instrument (DxH 800). WBC, NRBC, and PLT
counts were performed on the entire sample set using
previously published FCM reference methods (Chin-
Yee et al., 2001, 2002; Kaplan, Johnson & Wolfe,
2001; Keeney, Brown & Chin-Yee, 2001). The sam-
ples recruited for the study were speciﬁcally chosen so
that the analytical range of the DxH 800 was chal-
lenged. All samples were morphologically examined
and only those found to have NRBCs, giant PLTs, or
PLT clumping on a blood ﬁlm were considered truly
positive for those abnormalities.
DxH 800
The DxH 800 is a fully automated analyzer that pro-
vides a CBC, WBC differential, reticulocyte percentage
and number, and NRBC enumeration. Advanced signal
to noise algorithms have been developed with the goal

of improving the reportable range of this new
instrument (see Table 1), especially in the presence of
interference. The system comprises a data management
module running on MicrosoftÔ Windows XPÔ which
can store a database of up to 40 000 patient results with
graphical representation via a touch screen. Overall,
the DxH 800 cellular analysis system has a smaller foot-
print that the predicate LH 780 analyzer. A digital bar
code reader with 2D bar code capability is used for load-
ing control materials and reagents which should help in
reducing errors in instrument setup and accurately
tracking reagent use. The capacity is twenty separate
ﬁve-tube cassettes with a maximal automated through-
put of 100 samples per hour. The aspiration volume in
both open/closed vial modes has been reduced to
165 ll of sample allowing for small volume samples to
be run (e.g. pediatric samples). A new ﬂow cell design
supports additional light scatter measurements enabling
enhanced data acquisition for the WBC differential,
reticulocyte, and NRBC analyses. This enhanced data
collection allows the DxH 800 to collect 10 times more
information on each sample when compared to predi-
cate analyzers. These advances allow the DxH 800 to
accurately determine a WBC count even in the pres-
ence of interference. A new feature on the DxH 800 is
the appropriate correction of RBC parameters in the
presence of leukocytosis [uncorrected (UWBC)
11 · 109
/l]. Hemoglobin is corrected when the UWBC
count is 11 · 109
/l and if the UWBC count is
140 · 109
/l then the RBC count is automatically cor-
rected. The MCV, red cell distribution width (RDW),
and red cell distribution width standard deviation
(RDWSD) are corrected only if there is evidence that
the WBC events are negatively impacting the RBC his-
togram. The accuracy of the DxH 800 was determined
by analyzing samples on a predicate analyzer (LH 780)
and with a select group of parameters, by a ﬂow cyto-
metric reference method (FCM). Flagging rates were
determined by comparing data from the DxH 800 and
predicate LH 780 analyzer.
LH 780
The LH 780 is a fully automated random access ana-
lyzer with a throughput capability of 110 samples per
hour (CBC/DIFF only). The analyzer generates a CBC,
with a corrected WBC in the presence of interference,
a WBC differential, a reticulocyte percentage and
number, as well as a NRBC percentage and number.
The WBC count is derived by an impedance technol-
ogy similar to that of the DxH 800. Classiﬁcation of
WBCs is performed by threshold size discrimination
(>35 ﬂ). Interfering particles such as NRBCs, nonlysed
red cells, giant PLTs, or PLT clumps, or fragmented
cells which hover near this threshold potentially may
be included in the WBC count. If any interfering par-
ticles are detected, the LH 780 generates a suspect
message ‘cellular interference’ and will automatically
correct the WBC count if necessary. Enumeration of
the NRBC count is performed when particles are
detected in the NRBC signature positions of both the
WBC and the differential plots.
Manual RBC indices correction
The standard laboratory method involved centrifuga-
tion of the sample and preparation of a concentrated
red blood cell suspension, free of WBCs. The following
calculations were applied; the corrected RBC count
was determined by subtraction of the WBC count
from the original RBC number of the neat sample. A
corrected Hct was determined by multiplying the true
MCV, derived from the RBC suspension, by the cor-
rected RBC and dividing by 10. Finally, a corrected Hb
was calculated by multiplying the true MCHC, derived
from the RBC suspension, by the corrected Hct.
Daily operations
Daily checks were performed each day as part of rou-
tine startup procedures. Startup was performed to
ensure that the ﬂuidics lines were purged of cleaning
agent, and that the background counts, voltage read-
ings, and reagent dates were within acceptable limits
prior to data collection. Quality Control on all instru-
ments was run daily to ensure that all instruments
were operating within acceptable limits. Following
daily operation, shutdown was performed ensuring
appropriate cleansing of the ﬂuidic system.
Coulter XL-MCL
The ﬂow procedures were performed on a single laser
four-color Beckman Coulter XL-MCL ﬂow cytometer.
Alignment and calibration checks were performed
daily.

FCM reference procedures
WBC, PLT, and NRBC enumerations by FCM were
performed as previously described (Chin-Yee et al.,
2001, 2002; Kaplan, Johnson & Wolfe, 2001).
WBC counts were performed in duplicate by stain-
ing 100 ll of accurately pipetted whole blood with
5 ll of both CD45-PC5 and CD41-FITC for 15 min at
room temperature, protected from the light. Samples
with a WBC count of 50 · 109
/l were diluted with
5% albumin. Following this, red cells were lysed with
ammonium chloride and 100 ll of Flow-Count (Beck-
man Coulter) was accurately pipetted to each tube.
Samples were kept on ice until the time of analysis.
The average of the two reference counts was used.
For PLT enumeration, specimens were mixed
gently by inversion and 5 ll of whole blood added to
100 ll of PBS/BSA and incubated with 10 ll of CD41/
CD61- FITC for 15 min at room temperature, pro-
tected from the light. Samples were diluted to
1 : 1000 and immediately analyzed on the XL-MCL
with the stop count set at 50 000 red cells events and
a minimum of 2000 PLTs. For PLT counts >500 · 109
/
l, specimens were diluted in a larger volume of PBS/
BSA to reduce potential coincidence.
NRBC enumeration involved the incubation of
25 ll of whole blood with 10 ll CD45-FITC for
15 min at room temperature, protected from the light.
Following this, samples were mixed and incubated for
30 s with 250 ll of an acidic lysing solution contain-
ing propidium iodide. To quench this lysing solution
excess, 500 ll of alkaline reagent was subsequently
added. Samples were then incubated for 5 min at
room temperature prior to running on the XL-MCL.
Manual WBC differential
Two blood ﬁlms were prepared from each sample and
independently examined by different technologists.
Each technologist performed a 200-cell differential
count. The number of NRBCs was expressed per 100
WBCs.
Criteria for ﬂagging
Specimens that generated ‘P’ ﬂags (partial aspiration)
as well as non-numeric results were excluded from
the analysis. Samples were examined by manual
review to determine the number of NRBCs and if
giant PLTs or PLT clumping was present, only samples
found to have NRBCs by manual review were consid-
ered positive for NRBCs, all others were considered
negative.
Statistical methods
Correlation and regression analysis was performed
using Microsoft Excel. An analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was performed on the WBC, PLT, and NRBC results
to determine whether a signiﬁcance difference
between groups was present. If a signiﬁcant difference
was found, a Wilcoxon test for nonparametric data
was used to determine accuracy. Signiﬁcant P values
were values below 0.05, values greater than this were
not signiﬁcantly different. Biases were calculated on
the both ﬂagged and unﬂagged data. When the
ﬂagged data was removed from the analysis the biases
and percentage differences were reduced on WBC,
PLT, and NRBC data. False positive and false negative
rates for PLTs and NRBCs were determined on the LH
780 and DxH 800 and used to determine sensitivity
(TP/[TP + FN]) and speciﬁcity (TN/[TN + FP]) of each
analyzer vs. FCM. Receiver Operator Curves (ROCs)
were generated for the DxH 800 NRBC data vs. FCM.
The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was determined
from the ROC analysis (Aulesa et al., 2004). The
higher the AUC number the better the performance,
with 0.50 indicating random performance and 1.00
denoting perfect performance.
RESULTS
The goal of this study was to evaluate the new Beck-
man Coulter UniCelÒ
DxH 800 cellular analysis
system with particular focus on correlation of WBC,
NRBC and PLT enumeration to a predicate analyzer,
the CoulterÒ
LH 780 and FCM reference methods.
WBC
Samples were accrued in the WBC range of 0.1 to
190.4 · 109
/l (n = 247) and were examined to deter-
mine the precision and accuracy of the new DxH 800
analyzer. The DxH 800 WBC counts were correlated
with the LH 780 and FCM during the study period.

Lines of best ﬁt were generated for all the data
(Figure 1a) conﬁrming that the new DxH 800 demon-
strates extremely good correlation with the predicate
reference LH 780 analyzer and the reference FCM
(r2
= 0.998 and 0.994, respectively). Analysis of the
WBC counts for accuracy showed there was no signif-
icant difference between the DxH 800 and the LH 780
or FCM (P = 0.918, ANOVA). The DxH 800 showed no
statistical difference between results when compared
to both the LH 780 (P = 0.762) and FCM (P = 0.693)
with no signiﬁcant bias in leukocyte count, with or
without the samples ﬂagged for review removed
(Table 2).
A subset of the total number of samples (n = 46)
were ﬂagged for cellular interference, caused by the
presence of either giant PLTs, PLT clumping, or
NRBCs. The DxH 800 showed again high correlative
results with the LH 780 (r2
= 0.996) and FCM

(r2
= 0.990) in this subset (Figure 1b). These highly
correlative results were also accurate (showing no
statistical difference) when the DxH 800 was
compared to the LH 780 (P = 0.782) and FCM
(P = 0.654).
WBC count comparison of the DxH 800 in samples
determined to have NRBCs revealed that the DxH 800
correlates well with both the LH 780 and FCM (Fig-
ure 1c, r2
= 0.998 and r2
= 0.992, respectively).
The DxH 800 detects and compensates well for the
presence of interference to accurately enumerate
WBCs without signiﬁcant bias (see Table 2), The
number of samples with ﬂagged WBC values was sim-
ilar between the DxH 800 and the LH 780 (4% and
3%, respectively).
RBC parameters
A new feature of the DxH 800 is the automated cor-
rection of hemoglobin when the UWBC is 11 · 109
/
l. Correction is also performed, as appropriate, on
other parameters (RBC count, MCV, and RDW) when
the UWBC is 140 · 109
/l. A set of eight samples had
WBC counts 140 · 109
/l and were reviewed closely
to determine the difference between the corrected
counts on the DxH 800 and the standard laboratory
method of handling extreme leukocytosis and the
erroneous impact on red cell analysis. Results from
the calculations detailed in the materials and methods
section and from the DxH 800 are shown in Table 3.

and RDW values are comparable by both methods
with a slightly lower MCV noted by the manual
method.
PLT
For this study, a FCM reference procedure was used
to accurately validate PLT counts from the newly
developed DxH 800 analyzer. Samples analyzed by
FCM were in the PLT range of 1 to 1297 · 109
/l
(n = 256). The DxH 800 showed a strong correlation
with both the LH 780 and the FCM (r2
= 0.996 and
r2
= 0.985, respectively). The DxH 800 gave accurate
results when compared to both the LH 780 and the
FCM (P = 0.804, ANOVA) with a small, statistically
insigniﬁcant negative bias (Table 2). The accuracy
improved when samples that were ﬂagged for review
were excluded.
A subset of all the samples (n = 57) contained
megathrombocytes, a cellular characteristic that
potentially could inﬂuence the PLT count. The DxH
800 showed strong correlation with both reference
data sets again (LH 780 and FCM, Figure 2b) with r2
values of 0.996 and 0.974, respectively. A second sub-
set of samples containing microcytic or fragmented
RBCs (n = 28) were evaluated and again the DxH 800
analyzer demonstrated good correlation with the LH
780 and FCM data (Figure 2c) with r2
values of 0.998
and 0.966, respectively. Both of these PLT subsets
showed no signiﬁcant difference between groups (ANO-
VA, P = 0.514 and P = 0.903, respectively). PLT accu-
racy data at <50, <20, <10 · 109

ment, were ﬂagged for review by the analyzer. The
number of all samples with ﬂagged PLT values was
similar (10% on the DxH 800 and 9% on the LH 780)
in this group of predominantly hematologically abnor-
mal samples.
NRBC
A subset of samples were examined by manual review
and FCM to determine the number of NRBCs in each
(n = 246). Samples were in the range of 0 to 61
NRBCs/100 WBCs. The correct enumeration is clini-
cally important as in the majority of situations it indi-
cates stressed or disordered erythropoiesis and
potential disease. A number of studies have repeatedly
associated the presence of NRBCs with increased hos-
pital mortality (Schwartz & Stansbury, 1954; Stachon
et al., 2002; Kho et al., 2007). To determine the accu-
racy of NRBC enumeration we evaluated the new
DxH 800 compared to a FCM reference method that
very accurately enumerates NRBCs. The correlation
coefﬁcient between the DxH 800 and LH 780 was
determined to be 0.819. However, comparison of the
DxH 800 and LH 780 results to FCM (Figure 3a)
showed a signiﬁcant improvement in correlation with
the DxH 800 (r2
= 0.910) when compared to the pred-
icate LH 780 analyzer (r2
= 0.791). A signiﬁcant dif-
ference (P < 0.001, ANOVA) was found in the accuracy
of the NRBC count between all three groups (DxH
800, LH 780, and FCM). Comparison of the DxH 800
vs. FCM counts showed no signiﬁcant difference
(P > 0.05, Dunn’s post-test) whereas the LH 780
showed a signiﬁcant difference to the FCM counts
(P < 0.05, Dunn’s post-test). This demonstrates
improved NRBC enumeration by the DxH 800. ROC
were generated for the DxH 800 vs. the reference
FCM method. The AUC for the DxH 800 vs. FCM was
determined to be 0.96 which shows a signiﬁcant
improvement over the predicate analyzer
(AUC = 0.76). Further ROC analysis determined that
NRBC enumeration on the DxH 800 vs. FCM had
excellent speciﬁcity of 100% and sensitivity of 73%
(Figure 3b).
The DxH 800 showed signiﬁcant improvements
over the LH 780 in false negative (FN) rate, false posi-
tive (FP) rate, sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and bias in the
detection of NRBCs (shown in Table 5). Importantly,
there was a signiﬁcant decrease in false negative rate
compared to the LH 780 (DxH 800, 6% vs. LH 780,
10%); furthermore, no false positives were detected
on the DxH 800. The number of samples with the

NRBC parameter ﬂagged for review was reduced from
24% on the LH 780 to 14% on the DxH 800.
Increased sensitivity and speciﬁcity, much improved
correlation in particular in the range of 2–10 NRBCs
(DxH 800 vs. FCM, r2
= 0.806 from LH 780 vs. FCM,
r2
= 0.444), and decreased false negative/positive rate
indicate that the DxH 800 is signiﬁcantly better at
detecting and enumerating NRBCs.
DISCUSSION
The CBC performed by current laboratory instruments
is fast, reliable, and accurate on hematologically nor-
mal samples (Aulesa et al., 2003; Bourner, Dhaliwal &
Sumner, 2005). When all parameters are within nor-
mal ranges, the enumeration of cellular elements
including a ﬁve-part differential are available for
reporting in under a minute from presentation of the
sample to the instrument. This process slows down
considerably when the indices enumerated stray from
normal values or there are abnormalities within the
sample that cause ﬂagging or interference, necessitat-
ing veriﬁcation of the results prior to reporting. Cellu-
lar interference may inﬂuence the WBC count, giant
or clumped PLTs may inﬂuence PLT enumeration
leading to inaccurate clinical decision making, and the
accurate detection and enumeration of NRBCs may
indicate the presence of hematological or nonhemato-
logical disease (Schwartz & Stansbury, 1954; Harrison
et al., 2005; Segal et al., 2005; Bodey, 2009).
Samples were accrued for determining the accuracy
of the new DxH 800 in the ranges of 0.1 to
190.4 · 109
/l for WBC, 1 to 1297 · 109
/l for PLTs,
and 0–61 NRBCs/100 WBCs. All samples were exam-
ined to conﬁrm the accuracy and precision of the new
DxH 800 analyzer compared to the predicate analyzer,
LH 780, and Flow Cytometer Methods (FCMs) for
total WBC, PLT and NRBC counts. WBC differentials
were not compared in this study but may be the
objective of future studies. The DxH 800 provides
extremely precise and accurate PLT and WBC counts
over an impressive reporting range considering that
the samples were preselected based on abnormal
hematological parameters. The DxH 800 also performs
appropriate and accurate correction of red cell param-
eters in the presence of extreme leukocytosis
(140 · 109
/l). WBC and PLT enumeration in the
presence of interference results in a lower review rate
and faster turn around times with the DxH 800, when
compared to the LH 780. When compared to FCM,
the DxH 800 shows no bias in WBC count and PLTs
in the lower range; however, with higher PLT and
NRBC counts, the DxH 800 shows a slight negative
bias. The negative bias with high PLT values (which is
not seen at PLT values <50 · 109
/l) may be attributed
to the FCM reference. This reference method was
originally developed for low PLTs numbers
(<50 · 109
/l) and although a correction for higher
PLT numbers (>500 · 109
/l) was used the FCM tends
to overestimate the PLT value. This could account for
the discordance seen in the clinically insigniﬁcant
higher range between the DxH 800 and the FCM.
The DxH 800 cellular analysis system combines
mechanical and technological improvements over pre-
vious analyzers resulting in 10 times more data col-
lected per sample and translating into improved
accuracy and precision. The demand for accurate and
precise automated enumeration of WBC counts is dri-
ven by the demand placed on hematology laboratories
for rapid turnaround times on samples with abnormal
features. For WBC enumeration the most common
features for interference that generate ‘ﬂags’ are
NRBCs, megathrombocytes, PLT clumping, and WBC
counts in the lower range of linearity. Patients receiv-
ing active chemotherapy as cancer treatment require
rapid and accurate results to allow for decisions on
continuing treatment or to offer salvage therapy (Nav-
arro et al., 1998; Springer, von Ruecker & Dickerhoff,
1998; Sagmeister, Oec & Gmur, 1999; Cosler et al.,
2005; Nevo et al., 2007; Oka et al., 2007; Slichter,
2007; Dranitsaris et al., 2008; Bodey, 2009).
Our laboratory evaluated the new DxH 800 and
found that this new cellular analysis system is capable
of providing accurate WBC counts in the presence of
interfering particles and in the extreme low range

(<0.5 · 109
/l). The DxH 800 does generate ﬂags; how-
ever, the messages are more detailed than in previous
analyzers and alert the operator to potential sample or
enumeration issues. Manual review of these samples
may still be necessary, depending on laboratory pol-
icy, in order that accurate results are communicated
to the treating physician.
The heterogeneous morphology of NRBCs can lead
to signiﬁcant problems when enumerating WBC with
impedance technology. The ISLH method for correc-
tion is dependent on manual review of suspect sam-
ples identiﬁed by NRBC ﬂagging on a cellular analysis
system. The number of NRBCs are then enumerated,
expressed as the number present per 100 WBCs, and
the WBC count is subsequently adjusted mathemati-
cally. The assumption that all NRBCs have been
included within the WBC count may or may not hold
true. NRBCs smaller than the WBC threshold will not
have been included in the WBC count, whereas those
greater than the threshold have the potential to have
been. Manual correction for all the NRBCs seen by
morphological review may lead to over correction of
the WBC count. The DxH 800 uses advanced algo-
rithms and the collection of ten times more data than
previous analyzers to determine the ‘signature posi-
tion’ without the need for a nuclear dye (increasing
cost) or rerunning (increasing turn around time) as
with other commercially available analyzers.
One of the most beneﬁcial enhancements provided
by the DxH 800, in our estimation, is the appropriate
correction of red cell parameters in the presence of
extreme leukocytosis. Automated and accurate correc-
tion of RBC parameters will allow for more rapid turn
around times in patients with extreme leukocytosis,
forgoing the need for manual manipulation and the
potential for introduction of error.
The data in this study demonstrate that both test
and comparator instruments (DxH 800 and LH 780,
respectively) provide accurate PLT results and in the
case of the DxH 800, when the counts are extremely
low (<10 · 109
/l). A negative bias across the range of
PLT values above 50 · 109
/l explains the low P values
seen in Table 2. When PLTs in the critical range 0–
50 · 109
/l were compared, there was no bias noted
between the FCM and DxH 800 values. Cellular debris
(and other substances) and large PLTs may be
included or excluded in the PLT count and depending
on their proportions the machine may generate a
‘ﬂag’. Generation of the ﬂag requires veriﬁcation by
another method (either manual chamber count or
FCM), with the manual chamber count carrying a
high coefﬁcient of variation and FCM being impracti-
cal or unavailable for many laboratories. (Hanseler,
Fehr & Keller, 1996; Harrison et al., 2000). The DxH
800 boasts a signiﬁcant increase in the amount of
information (256 channels) collected on each sample.
This combined with advances in algorithms and infor-
mation sharing between other modules (potential
interference detected in another parameter, e.g. micr-
ocytic RBC) help to reduce ﬂagging and better enu-
merate PLTs at low levels. The accurate enumeration
of low numbers of PLTs is important because throm-
bocytopenia may be a dose-limiting factor for cancer
patients undergoing chemotherapy and also serves a
trigger for PLT transfusion therapy (Navarro et al.,
1998).
The CSLI and ISLH guidelines have established the
lower limit for detection of NRBCs to be 1 per 100
WBCs. We observed a small negative bias, ()0.6), in
NRBC enumeration on the DxH 800 over the range
from 0 to 60 NRBCs compared to FCM (FCM). It
should be noted, however, that below 10 NRBCs the
bias seen was very small. The ability to enumerate
NRBCs at the lower limit is now available on the new
DxH 800, representing a signiﬁcant improvement.
The DxH 800 represents an improvement to previ-
ous analyzers with an extended range for key parame-
ters, better sensitivity in the low range, as well as the
accurate detection and enumeration of NRBCs at
counts >1/100 WBCs. The reduction in ﬂagging rate
of the NRBC parameter should translate into reduced
numbers of technically demanding and time-consum-
ing blood ﬁlm reviews. The automatic correction of
RBC parameters in extreme leukocytosis eliminates
the need for operator intervention and should signiﬁ-
cantly reduce the turn around time of severely abnor-
mal results. These enhancements are afforded without
the requirement of rerunning the sample or additional
reagents.
