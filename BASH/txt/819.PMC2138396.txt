Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), an extract from the kidney bean Phaseolus
vulgaris in which the active principle is a protein molecule with a high affinity
for polysaccharides, has a marked mitogenic effect upon peripheral lymphocytes
in vitro (1, 2). Most studies of this phenomenon have concerned themselves
with the action of PHA upon immune competent lymphocytes. It has been
shown that such cells exposed to PHA undergo blastoid transformation, enter
mitosis, begin synthesizing protein, and in some cases manifest an anamnestic
response (3-5). Recently, however, several investigations have considered the
effects of PHA on the marrow lymphocyte and on hemopoiesis. Humble (6)
postulated that PHA might result in marrow stimulation in cases of aplastic
anemia by causing proliferation and/or transformation of the marrow lympho-
cyte, which is believed by some workers to represent the stem cell (7, 8). He
administered PHA to six patients with symptomatic aplastic anemia and re-
ported evidence of marrow stimulation in all cases, Other workers have reported
results suggesting that PHA provides significant but temporary stimulation
of hemopoiesis in cases of drug-induced marrow failure, but that it is ineffective
in cases of idiopathic aplastic anemia (9-11). In an experiment involving in
vitro culture of the aplastic anemic patient's peripheral leukocytes with PHA,
followed by injection of the stimulated cells directly back into the patient's
marrow spaces, Astaldi et al. (12) found only equivocal indications of hemo-
poietic stimulation.
Papac (13) working with PHA in vivo in small rodents, looked for radiopro-
tective and Inyeloproliferativeeffects after lethal doses of irradiation, but found
no conclusive evidence for such effects. We have previously reported that lymph
nodes but not thymus of PHA-treated mice undergo a slight increase in their
low content of spleen colony-forming units (14). This paper seeks to explore
further the action of PHA upon hemopoietic precursor cells.

Materials and Methods
The animals used and methods for administering X-irradiation, producing endogenous
colonies,collectingand injecting bone marrow cells, harvesting and counting spleen colonies,
and identifying the types of colonies,have been described in previous publications (15, 16).
Retransplantation of colonieswas performed by dissectingout individual coloniesfrom the
fresh spleen with sharp pointed scissorsand small pointed forceps. The colony was then cut
in half; onepiecewasplaced directly into 0.2 ml of Eagle's minimum essentialmedium (MEM)
without serum, and the other was imprinted lightly, cut surface down, three times on a clean
glassslideand then placed into the MEM. The cellswereexpressedfrom the colony halves by
gentle pressure from a smooth-tipped glass rod, and the bits of stroma remaining were re-
moved. In some cases cell counts were performed on the suspensions at this point, in the
manner describedpreviously (15), to determine the number of viable nucleated cells.The cell
suspensionwas diluted to 0.5 ml with MEM, taken up in a tuberculin syringe, and injected
into a singlerecipient mouse via a lateral tail vein. The imprintswere air dried, fixedfor 3 min
in absolute methanol, and stained by the May-Griinwald-Giemsa technique (17).
Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was generallyadministered by the intraperitoneal route. Rigas
and Osgood (18) reported that the purified protein fraction of PHA retained all of the mito-
genic activity possessed by the mucoprotein substance and was 50 times more potent. For
this reason the more refined PHA-P1 was used rather than the mucoprotein PHA-M~. The
dose usedwas 20/zg per g of body weight of the protein PHA dissolvedin isotonic saline and
administered in a volume of 0.5 ml. This dose was comparable to the amounts used by Mac-
Kinney (19)for the study of human lymphocytes in vitro, but is below the levelsfound toxic
in vivo by Norins and Marshall (20). Mekori et al. (21) reported using 0.3 ml of PHA-M per
mouse intravenously, which when prepared in the customary fashion is approximately equal
in potency to 10/zg of PHA-P per g of body weight.
RESULTS
Effect of PttA Treatment of the Bone Marrow Donor on the Number and Types
of Spleen Colonies Formed.--Two groups of mice were exposed to 850 R whole-
body X-irradiation. One group was injected with femoral marrow cells (4 X 104,
8 X 104, or 12 X 10~viable nucleated isogeneic ceils) from a pool of three nor-
mal donors and the other group was injected with the same number of pooled
marrow cells from three donors that had received daily injections of PHA for 3
days prior to sacrifice. All recipient mice were sacrificed 8 days after marrow in-
jection, the spleens removed and the colonies counted. There was a consistent
but slight decrease (not quite statistically significant) in the total number of
colonies found. The proportions of the various cell types of colonies were not
significantly changed (Table I).
Effect of PHA Treatment of the Marrow Recipient on DevelopingSpleen Colo-
nies.--Two groups of mice were exposed to 850 R whole-body X-irradiation and
injected with 4 X 1@ cell aliquots of the same marrow suspension from a single
isogeneic donor. One group was not treated further, while the other received
daily intraperitoneal injections of PHA. All mice were sacrificed 8 days after
marrow injection, the spleens were weighed, and sections were made for colony

counting and typing. A third group of animals was irradiated but not injected,
to determine the postirradiation weight of spleens without colonies. In the
PHA-treated mice there were approximately the same total number of colonies,

but there was a significantly greater proportion of mixed colonies, more mega-
karyocytes, and a reduction of the proportion of erythroid, of neutrophilic, and
of undifferentiated colonies (Table II). Histologically, the appearance of the de-
veloping colonies was quite similar to that of colonies in untreated hosts except
822 HEMOPOIETIC SPLEEN COLONY STUDIES. IV
in two regards. In addition to the normal spectrum of cell types usually found in
spleen colonies there was an unusually high proportion of large, undifferentiated
ceils, many of which had a blastoid appearance (Fig. 1). These cells resembled
in general appearance the transformed ceils found in cultures of peripheral
lymphocytes cultured with PHA. The other unusual feature was the finding of
hemopoietic ceils, nearly always of mixed types, in a peculiar, sharply de-
lineated distribution (Fig. 2). The appearance suggests that sinusoidal passages
are packed with proliferating or emigrating hemopoietic ceils. It may be signifi-
cant that the bone marrow sinusoids are normally rich in small lymphocytes,

i.e., the "lymphocyte loading" of Yoffey (7). In general the colonies were
smaller (Table II). The size of the colonies was determined in two ways:
Mean colony weight was estimated by determining the mean weight of spleens
without colonies and subtracting this from the mean weight of spleens contain-
ing colonies. The difference was then divided by the mean mtmber of colonies
per spleen to arrive at the mean single colony weight. The colonies developing
under the influence of PHA weighed on the average only half as much as normal
colonies (Table II).
Mean cell number per colony: In this experiment the same treatment groups
were used as for the experiment above, but the colonies were counted grossly
in the fresh spleen, and the five largest colonies dissected out, imprinted for
identification, and suspended for cell counts. Again there was virtually no
difference in the total number of colonies and there were relatively more mixed
colonies (Table III). No megakaryocytic or undifferentiated colonies were
found, but we have shown that none are to be expected by this method for they
J. L. CURRY AND J. J'. TRENTIN 823
are too small to be grossly visible and dissectable (15). The cell counts verified
the impression that the colonies developing under the influence of PHA were
smaller. This was particularly true of the mixed colony type. Either PHA re-
duced the rate of growth of spleen colonies, or, perhaps more likely, increased
the rate of emigration of cells out of the colonies and into the sinusoids.

--Two groups of animals were irradiated with 850 R. Each animal was injected
with a suspension of all the cells expressed from a single colony, one group re-
ceiving normal 10-day colonies while the other group received colonies which
developed under the influence of PHA for 10 days as in the experiments above.
10 days after injection the recipients were sacrificed and the spleens prepared

for histological study. The results are shown in Table IV. The PHA-treated
colonies had significantly fewer CFU's, but the spectrum of colonies formed
upon retransplantation was almost identical with that of normal colonies.
Effect of PHA on Endogenous Colonies.--Since PHA tended to reduce the
number of CFU's in the marrow, it was of interest to study the effect of this
agent on the formation and development of endogenous colonies.
Two groups of animals were irradiated with 770 R, and one group was given
daily injections of PHA until sacrifice. The spleens were harvested 9 days
postirradiation and prepared for histological study. The results are shown in
Table V. At this dose of irradiation PHA significantly increased the number of
endogenous colonies formed, but there were too few colonies in these experi-
ments to determine whether there was any effect of PHA on the colony types.
However, pooled data from these and several other experiments involving PHA
and endogenous colonies revealed considerable differences in the proportions
of the various colony types found. In particular, as in the case of exogenous
marrow colonies, there was an increase in mixed colonies at the expense of the
824 HEMOPOIETIC SPLEEN COLONYSTUDIES. IV
other types (Table VI). When similar experiments were done giving PHA injec-
tions for 3 days prior to irradiation, no significant effect on the number of
endogenous colonies was noted. It was concluded that PHA administered after
irradiation increased the number of endogenous colonies and increased the
proportion of mixed endogenous colonies.

:~The smaller number of colonies per spleen of PHA-treated animals is the result of higher
dose of irradiation. At comparable irradiation doses, PHA-treated animals had more colonies
per spleen (see Table V).
Effect of PllA on Survival after Whole-Body Irradiation.--The increased
number of endogenous spleen colonies found after PHA treatment raised the
possibility of more rapid hematologic recovery after irradiation and subsequent
manifestation as improved survival. Paired groups of animals were irradiated
at 600, 700, 800, and 900 R. The mice in one group of each pair were given daily
injections of PHA for 21 days postirradiation. The PHA-treated mice had a
significantly improved survival at 600 and 700 R, as determined by the Kolmo-
gorov-Smirnov test (22) for the difference between two cumulative percentages
J. L. CURRY AND J. J. TRENTIN 825
(Text-Fig. 1). At higher doses of irradiation no protective effect was noted.
Similar experiments were performed using pretreatment of the mice with injec-
tions of PHA on the 3 days prior to irradiation, but no significant difference in
survival was noted at any of the four irradiation dose levels.
DISCUSSION
The results indicate that PHA exerts significant effects upon hematopoietic
tissues in vivo. These effects are apparently multiple and complex, and not
simple of interpretation. Apparently opposing effects were obtained in the
endogenous irradiation recovery experiments as compared to the bone marrow
transplantation experiments. In the former, PHA administered after irradiation
(but not before irradiation) stimulated endogenous hemopoietic spleen colony
formation, and enhanced postirradiation recovery and survival. In the trans-
planted marrow systems, PHA treatment of the donor, if anything, reduced
the number of CFU, whereas PHA treatment of the recipient resulted in smaller
more differentiated colonies. Whether any of these effects are related to or
secondary to previously reported effects of PHA is not clear. The previously
reported biological effects of PHA include the following:
Hemagglutinating activity: this leaves the leukocytes free in suspension;
first used for a rapid and efficient separation of leukocytes from blood by Li
and Osgood (23).
Mitogenic activity in vitro: peripheral leukocytes (later shown to be lympho-
cytes) incubated in vitro with PHA were shown to transform into blasts and
begin dividing (1); PHA provided mitotic stimulation to all of the lines of tissue
culture cells to which it was added (24).
Leukoagglutinating activity: Hirschhorn et al. (4) showed that PHA caused
aggregation of lymphocytes prior to transformation and mitosis.
Stimulation of an immune response: lymphocytes after transformation by
PHA have been shown to produce -r-globulin (4) and react with a specific
anamnestic response (5).
Radioprotective activity: Schrek and Stefani (25) demonstrated that stimu-
lation by PHA conferred a remarkable radioresistance on lymphocytes in vitro,
but Papac (13) could not obtain a significantly improved survival of irradiated
mice when PHA was administered in one dose immediately after irradiation.
Myeloproliferative activity: Humble (6) found evidence of marrow stimula-
tion in all of six aplastic anemia patients given PHA, and Israel et al. (26) found
that PHA increased the hematologic tolerance of patients to massive cancer
chemotherapy. However, Papac (13) could find no significant effect of PHA on
the cell count or morphology of rodent marrow after irradiation.
Toxicity: several workers (13, 20, 27) have investigated the toxicity of PHA
in mice. Respiratory distress, paresis, and sudden death are most commonly
reported, especially when PHA was administered intravenously. Arthus reac-

tion's and anaphylaxis were found with repeated injections of PHA in guinea
pigs.
An important consideration is whether several of the above are manifesta-
tions of the same effect. The hemagglutinating effect, although once believed
inseparable from the mitogenic effect (28), has been selectively removed both
by drastic chemical procedures (29) and by repeated absorption by red cells
(30), leaving only the mitogenic activity. However, many of the other effects of
PHA may be explained on the basis of one or the other of these two separable
properties. Hirschhorn et al. (4) concluded that leukoagglutination, transforma-
tion to blasts, mitosis, and ~r-globulin synthesis were different stages in a single
response of lymphocytes to PHA.
The toxicity of PHA might well be explained by intravascular hemagglutina-
tion and possibly pulmonary emboli. In mice receiving doses of PHA over long
periods anaphylaxis might be considered as a mode of toxicity; but in the ex-
perience of this laboratory adverse reactions have occurred only acutely, after
the first intravenous dose of PHA, and a phenomenon more immediate than
allergy must be postulated.
For the purposes at hand, the most interesting effect is that of transformation
of cells in vitro. Most work along these lines has been done with peripheral
lymphocytes, which are the only cells in peripheral blood that respond to PHA.
This phenomenon might be due either to the possibility that PHA has a spe-
cific effect on lymphocytes or to the fact that of all the cells in the blood, only
the lymphocytes are capable of mitosis. PHA might be a nonspecific stimulant
for mitosis. Recent studies have shown PHA to be a stimulant for growth in
several lines of cells in tissue culture (24).
At least one action of PHA on the cell membrane is known: agglutination of
like cells. As Hirschhorn has suggested, this in itself is necessary and sufficient
to trigger new metabolic activities in some cell types. That cell-to-cell contact
has some role in regulating cell division is apparent not only from in vitro stud-
ies with lymphocytes but also from the well-known tissue Culture phenomenon
of "contact inhibition." L
The rationale for Humble's use of PHA in aplastic anem~:i(6) rested on the
possibility that the PHA transformation of lymphocytes,:'~hich"~¢-are usually
present in that disease, might include transformation to stem cells which
could repopulate the marrow. The results of work along this line, although not
providing unequivocal evidence, are quite suggestive of some kind of myelo-
proliferative effect which cannot be explained on the basis of hemagglutination
or lymphocyte transformation to immune-active cells. Astaldi et al. (12) found
signs of increased marrow cellularity and function when they exposed a patient's
lymphocytes to PHA in vitro and then reinjected them into the marrow cavity,
suggesting that PHA can transform lymphoid cells into myeloid precursors.
The increased number of endogenous colonies after a given dose of irradiation,
828 HEMOPOIETIC SPLEENCOLONYSTUDIES.IV
the formation of spleen colonies by lymph node cells, and the improvement in
postirradiation survival found with injections of PHA or lymphoid cells from
PHA-treated donors can all be explained by the hypothesis that PHA may
transform a precursor cell (which may appear morphologically as a lympho-
cyte) into a functionally myeloid CFU. On the other hand, the decreased CFU
content of the bone marrow and increased CFU content of the lymphoid organs
of PHA-treated mice might in fact represent PHA-induced migration of CFU
from marrow to lymphoid organs, and possibly elsewhere. Indeed Micklem (31)
has reported an increase in the spleen colony forming units circulating in the
blood of mice 72 hr after intravenous injection of0.3 ml of PHA, and a small in-
crease in the CFU content in the lymph nodes.
The disparity in the results between testing the effects of PHA in the en-
dogenous system and in the transplantation system presents a problem in in-
terpretation. Porteous and Lajtha (32) have cautioned against comparison of
hemopoietic regeneration studies in the two systems, pointing out that the
transplantation system, compared to endogenous repopulation, is nonphysio-
logic, involves the trauma of manipulation, and often fails to transplant the
stem cells which are manifest in the endogenous system. A consideration of
their criticisms has led us to speculate that perhaps the stem cell or CFU exists
in two forms-a small lymphocytoid form which is transplantable, and a large,
undifferentiated hemohistioblast which (perhaps because of its size, fragility
and/or attachment to the reticulum) is not amenable to transplantation in a
cell suspension given intravenously. In order to reach the spleen or bone marrow,
intravenously transplanted stem cells must first traverse the pulmonary vascu-
lar network. If the effect of PHA upon the CFU is indeed to stimulate pro-
liferation involving a blastoid transformation (in a fashion analogous to its
effect upon lymphocytes in vitro), the observation of blastoid cells in the PHA-
influenced spleen colonies and the results of these experiments are understand-
able, i.e., PHA-transformed stem cells may not be detectable by transplantation
but readily detectable in an endogenous system (increase in endogenous colonies
or improved survival postirradiation).
Further experiments in this area should include studies on the in vitro effects
of PHA on bone marrow and on the CFU content of lymphocytes from various
sources transformed in vitro by PHA.
SUMMARY
The effects of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) were studied in irradiated mice to
see if a definite myeloproliferative effect could be demonstrated in vivo. The
data obtained suggested the following conclusions.
PHA treatment of the bone marrow donor only, causes a consistent but
J. L. CURRY AND J. J. TRENTIN 829
slight reduction in transplantable spleen colony-forming unit (CFU) content
of the bone marrow 24 hr after the last PHA injection, but no change was
found in the proportion of the various colony types.
PHA treatment of the irradiated recipient of normal bone marrow causes no
change in the number of spleen colonies. However, 8-day colonies are only about
half normal size, are much more likely to be of mixed cell types, contain many
large undifferentiated blastoid cells, but fewer transplantable CFU. The spleen
sinusoids are packed with hemopoietic cells.
Spleen colonies developing in hosts receiving daily injections of PHA show,
in addition to the usual spectrum of cell types, a high proportion of unusual
blastoid cells resembling the PHA transformed peripheral lymphocytes seen in
vitro. The function of these cells is not known, but they may represent aug-
mented proliferation and/or transformation of stem cells.
PHA administered after irradiation significantly increased the number of
endogenous spleen colonies, and, at certain doses of irradiation, improved post-
irradiation survival.
PHA administered before irradiation had no effect on the number of en-
dogenous spleen colonies formed, or on postirradiation survival.
On the basis of these and other data, possible modes of action of PHA are
discussed.

832 HEMOPOIETIC SPLEEN COLONY STUDIES. IV
EXPLANATION OF PLATES
PLATE61
FIG. 1. Large, undifferentiated, blastoid cells appearing in a spleen colony in a
(C5~ X M)F1 mouse which received 850 R whole-body irradiation, 8 × 104 viable
isogeneic marrow cells, and daily injections of 0.4 rag PHA-P until sacrifice 10 days
postirradiation. Such cells are much more common in colonies arising in PHA-treated
hosts, and they resemble in many ways the PHA-transformed lymphocytes seen in
tissue culture. Hematoxylin and eosin. X 1400.

PLATE62
FIG. 2. Intrasinusoidal mixed hemopoietic cells occurring in the spleen of a (C57 X
Af)F1 mouse which had received 850 R whole-body irradiation, 8 X 104 isogeneic
marrow cells and daily injections of PHA, until sacrifice 10 days postirradiation.
Neither the homogeneous mixture of different cell types nor the peculiar intraluminal
"packing" of hemopoiesis have been noted in the spleens of colony-bearinghosts not
treated with PHA. In the marrow, however, lymphocytes in unusually high concen-
trations are characteristically found within the sinusoids. Hematoxylin and eosin.
X 306.
