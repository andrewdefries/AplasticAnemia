Chemically Induced Leukemia in Humans
by Richard H. Adamson* and Susan M. Seiber*
The human population may be exposed to potentially leukemogenic agents, either in the form
of drugs and food additives or as environmental contaminants and pollutants. However, in spite
of the large number and diversity of these chemicals, only a few have been implicated as human
leukemogens. One such agent is benzene, a known bone marrow depressant. A number of case
reports have associated chronic exposure to this agent with the development of acute leukemia,
as have several epidemiologic surveys. Treatment with various antitumor agents, including
procarbazine, melphalan, thio-TEPA, chlorambucil, and cyclophosphamide, has also been
associated with the development of acute leukemia. In addition, chloramphenicol and
phenylbutazone have been implicated as human leukemogens, but the association between
exposure to these two agents and acute leukemia appears at present to be weaker than it is for
benzene and antitumor agent exposure. Despite such associations between exposure to
chemicals and acute leukemia, several important problems exist with regard to implicating
specific agents in the development of this neoplasm in man, including the paucity of animal
models for chemically induced leukemia, and the frequent necessity to rely on single case
reports or clusters of cases in which chemical exposures are associated with acute leukemia.
Future efforts should be directed at performing properly designed and well executed
epidemiologic studies, and at developing new in vitro and in vivo models for the study of this
neoplasm.
Introduction
The incidence of all types of leukemia in the
general population is approximately 6/100,000 per
year (1). Acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL)
accounted for 36% of all leukemias diagnosed in the
U.S. between 1954 and 1964, and for 44% of
leukemias detected between 1965 and 1969 (2). The
etiology of ANLL is largely unknown, although
there is some evidence that chromosome breakage
and/or aneuploidy may be a factor. For example,
patients with Down's, Fanconi's, or Bloom's syn-
dromes are known to suffer a higher incidence of
acute myelogenous leukemia than occurs in the
general population (3). A viral etiology for ANLL
has also been proposed but is difficult to prove, and
the causative role of viruses in this disease is
impossible to assess at present (4).
It has been known since the early 1960's that
ionizing radiation is a leukemogen in experimental

animals and in humans (5-7). More recently the
leukemogenic potential of chemical agents has been
recognized, and a number of chemicals have been
clearly shown to produce leukemia in experimental
animals (8-12). However, chemically induced
hematopoietic neoplasms in rodents, the experi-
mental animals most frequently used in carcinogenesis
testing, are primarily lymphomas and lymphoid
leukemias; the only chemical which has been reported
to induce a high incidence of nonlymphocytic leu-
kemia in rats is N-butyl-N-nitrosourea (13). There
is some evidence that certain chemicals may also be
causative factors in human ANLL, but several
important problems exist with regard to implicat-
ing specific agents with the development of this
neoplasm in man. First, few satisfactory epidemio-
logic studies have been carried out in this area, and
it is necessary to rely on single case reports or
clusters of cases in which chemical exposures are
associated with the development of ANLL. In
addition, information as to the dose, the dose rate
and the size of the population at risk is generally
not available. And finally, few suitable animal
93
models for ANLL have as yet been developed.
Nevertheless, based on information obtained from
numerous case reports, several epidemiologic stud-
ies, and from studies in experimental animals, a
number of chemicals have been implicated as etio-
logic agents in human leukemia.
Chemicals Implicated as
Leukemogens in Humans
By far the largest proportion ofagents implicated
as human leukemogens are the alkylating agents
employed in cancer chemotherapy (Table 1). Dur-
ing the past decade, approximately 150 case reports
of ANLL developing after treatment with cancer
chemotherapeutic agents have appeared in the
literature (14). The great majority of these leuke-
mias were morphologic variants of acute myeloge-
nous or myelomonocytic leukemia, and developed
after exposure to various alkylating agents either
given as single agents or in combination with other
drugs. In addition to the antitumor agents, benzene
has been implicated as a causative factor in human
leukemia, and there is also some evidence that
chloramphenicol and phenylbutazone may be
leukemogens. Exposure to a variety of other chem-
icals, including chloroquine (15), lysergic acid
diethylamide (16-19), methoxypsoralen (20), griseo-
fulvin (21), and ethylene oxide (22, 23), has been
associated with the development of human leuke-
mia, but for these chemicals the present evidence
for risk appears to be tenuous at best. Therefore,
this discussion will center around only those chemi-
cals which are most strongly implicated as human
leukemogens, namely benzene, cancer chemother-
apeutic agents, chloramphenicol, and phenylbutazone.
Benzene
Benzene is a constituent ofgasoline, occurs in the
gaseous phase of cigarette smoke, and is in wide
use in industrial and laboratory settings (24). In
addition, benzene occurs naturally in the environ-
ment in a variety of plants and natural foodstuffs
such as nuts, tomatoes, pineapples and strawber-
ries (25). The depressant effect of benzene on bone
marrow is well documented (26), and it was on the
basis of this effect that benzene was used in the
past for treating chronic myelogenous leukemia
(27). In fact, the development of the concept that
bone marrow suppression may be a prerequisite for
the development of leukemia arose from the obser-
vation that exposure to toxic levels of benzene led
to marrow hypoplasia prior to the emergence of
ANLL (28).
The myelosuppressive effects of benzene can
become manifest any time from a few weeks to
several years after exposure. An hematological
examination usually suggests the presence of mar-
row hypoplasia. This disorder is accompanied by a
decrease in red blood cells in the peripheral blood
with a parallel fall in the hemoglobin level, indicat-
ing a mildly hyperchromic form of anemia.
Macrocytosis may occur as is often the case with
hypoplastic anemia. The number of white cells is
low, usually less than 4000/mm3, and there is a
decrease in neutrophils and a relative lymphocyto-
sis. In addition, there is a shift to the right in the
differential count, the platelets are reduced in
number and their morphology is altered. The mar-
row usually shows a diminution of cells, including
absence of megakaryocytes, but sometimes the
most immature forms of red and white cells are
present in large numbers. Relatively few are
intermediate or late normoblasts, myelocytes or
metamyelocytes because of the marked shift in
maturation. With repeated exposures to benzene
the same picture reappears and may develop into
acute or chronic progressive pancytopenia (26).
There is no doubt therefore that benzene can
produce aplasia of the bone marrow in humans.
Evidence for the leukemogenicity of benzene
comes from numerous case reports and from sev-
eral epidemiologic surveys. For example, Aksoy
reported that 26 people among 28,500 shoe workers
who were exposed to benzene developed leukemia
or preleukemia. The most common diagnosis was

acute myeloblastic leukemia, which was seen in 14
of the 26 cases. The duration of benzene exposure
varied from 1-15 years with a mean of 9.7 years.
The annual incidence was 13/100,000 compared to
6/100,000 in the general population (29).
In another study, Vigliani and Saita (30) exam-
ined the incidence of leukemia in workers at shoe
factories and in rotogravure plants where benzene
was used as a solvent for glues and inks, respective-
ly. The risk ofleukemia was at least 20 times higher
than in the general population and the majority of
leukemias were myeloblastic, although one case of
erythroleukemia also occurred.
Girard and Revol (31) carried out a retrospective
study between 1966 and 1969 of 401 subjects with
hemopathies and 124 controls with nonhematologic
diseases in Lyon hospitals. They found that a
significantly higher proportion of patients with
aplastic anemia, acute leukemia or chronic lym-
phocytic leukemia had a history of exposure to
benzene or toluene or to products containing ben-
zene or toluene during the previous 10 years than
did the controls. This was not true, however, for
chronic myeloid leukemia or other blood disorders.
Despite this apparent association between ben-
zene exposure and the development of leukemia, it
is important to be aware of several points which
tend to confuse the picture. First, in essentially all
cases of leukemia attributed to benzene exposure,
benzene itself was only one of several chemical
agents to which the subject was exposed (24).
Second, although there is no question that benzene
is toxic in animals, it has not consistently produced
hematologic or other malignancies despite exten-
sive testing (32-34). And finally, Thorpe (35) carried
out an epidemiologic study of 38,000 petroleum
workers exposed to low levels of benzene for 10
years; he found no suggestion of a leukemogenic
effect in this group, in which the incidence of
leukemia resembled that of the general population.
Although the Thorpe study has been criticized for
some aspects ofthe methodology (36), nevertheless
the results must be considered along with those
from the other positive studies described above.
Procarbazine
Procarbazine is an antineoplastic agent which is
used chiefly as a component of the MOPP regimen.
The MOPP regimen, which also includes nitrogen
mustard (M), vincristine (0), and prednisone (P), is
in wide use for treating Hodgkin's disease, a
malignancy for which it appears curative (37).
Direct evidence for the leukemogenic effects of
procarbazine comes from animal studies in mice,
rats and nonhuman primates. Procarbazine has
been indirectly linked to human ANLL through
numerous clinical case reports of Hodgkin's disease
patients treated with the MOPP regimen who
subsequently developed ANLL (14), and several
surveys of large numbers of treated Hodgkin's
disease patients in which the same phenomenon
was noted.
The most persuasive experimental evidence that
procarbazine is leukemogenic derives from a study
of the long-term toxicity of this drug in nonhuman
primates (38). A group of50 rhesus and cynomolgus
monkeys has received intraperitoneal or subcuta-

neous and oral doses of procarbazine for periods up
to 14 years. To date, 13 (26%) of the monkeys have
developed malignant neoplasms, and 7 of the 13
malignancies were ANLL (Table 2). The leukemias
were diagnosed in monkeys that had received an
average cumulative procarbazine dose of 45.54 g
(range 2.64-103.69 g); they developed after latent
periods ranging from 16 to 143 months (average 77
months). The spontaneous tumor incidence in this
monkeys colony is 2.8%, and no case of acute
leukemia has been observed in control monkeys
during the past 14 years.
Procarbazine is a potent carcinogen in rodents as
well as in nonhuman primates; however, the tumors
it induces in mice and rats are not ANLL, but
instead are lung and mammary carcinomas and
lymphocytic leukemia (12, 39, 40). As noted above,
few experimental animals develop ANLL in re-
sponse to carcinogen exposure. The exceptions are
rats exposed to N-butyl-N-nitrosourea and nonhuman
primates, suggesting that the latter species may be
a particularly good model for evaluating the poten-
tial leukemogenicity of drugs and other chemicals.
The leukemogenic activity of procarbazine has
also been inferred from human observations. Sev-
eral relatively large surveys of Hodgkin's disease
patients have been published which specify the
total number of patients observed, the length of
time during which the observations were made, and
the number of patients who developed ANLL.
From this information it was possible to estimate
the incidence of ANLL and compare it with that in
the general population of the U.S. (2.2/100,000 per
year). The incidence of ANLL, expressed as
cases/100,000 per year, in nine groups of Hodgkin's
disease patients was calculated from published
reports, and is shown graphically in Figure 1.
In two surveys of Hodgkin's disease patients,
encompassing over 3,000 cases observed from 1944
to 1953 (41) and from 1949 to 1962 (42), no cases of
ANLL were noted. In most of the other surveys
(43-47), however, the incidence of ANLL has
ranged between 15 and 26/100,000 per year,
representing a 5-10-fold increase over the incidence
ofANLL in the general population. An incidence of
156 was calculated for a group ofpatients described
by Weiden (48), and an even higher incidence (406)
derived from a report by Bonadonna et al. (49).
Although these two values represent 50-100 fold
increases over the incidence of ANLL in the
general population, it should be noted that they
came from small groups of Hodgkin's disease pa-
tients which have been treated relatively recently.
Thus it appears that successfullly treated Hodgkin's
disease patients are at increased risk of developing
ANLL. The role that the therapy they received

played in the etiology of the leukemias is not
completely clear. For example, it is possible that
Hodgkin's disease patients are predisposed to de-
velop multiple neoplasms, and that the therapy
employed served to extend their survival sufficiently
long to aliow for the development of the second
tumor (ANLL). In addition, many (but not all) of
the patients developing ANLL following successful
treatment for Hodgkin's disease received ionizing
radiation, a known human leukemogen (6, 7). Nev-
ertheless, there does seem to be a clear association
between the MOPP regimen and ANLL; on the
basis of the available experimental evidence, the
component of the MOPP regimen most likely to be
leukemogenic is procarbazine.
Melphalan
Melphalan is an antineoplastic agent active against
a variety of human neoplasms, and is employed as
prophylactic chemotherapy following surgery for
ovarian and mammary carcinoma as well. Its widest
use, however, is in the treatment of multiple
myeloma and other plasma cell dyscrasias. It is now
apparent that patients receiving prolonged treat-
ment with melphalan are at increased risk of
developing ANLL. The association between
melphalan treatment and ANLL comes from nu-
merous case reports of patients developing leuke-
mia after melphalan treatment for malignant dis-
ease (50-62), including at least 21 patients with
multiple myeloma (50-56, 61), 14 women with
ovarian carcinoma (57-61), and one patient with
Environmental Health Perspectives
mammary carcinoma (62). Several patients with
nonmalignant disease who received therapy with
melphalan have also developed ANLL (63-66), and
a number of large surveys of multiple myeloma
patients have indicated that this population may
indeed be at increased risk for ANLL.
The incidence of ANLL in multiple myeloma
patients was calculated for seven groups ofpatients
in which the appropriate information as to sample
size, observation period, and number of patients
developing this complication was specified (Fig. 2).
In one survey (67), no cases of multiple myeloma
terminating as ANLL were found among 57 pa-
tients observed between 1930 and 1956. In six other
surveys of myeloma patients (68-73), the incidence
of ANLL ranged between 20 to more than 5000.
This latter value, representing an approximately
2000-fold increase over the incidence in the general
population, came from a report by Anderson and
Videbaek (71) on a small group ofpatients observed
over a relatively short and recent time period. As
with the Hodgkin's disease patients developing
ANLL, the leukemia emerging as a terminal event
in multiple myeloma patients may be related to the
therapy employed. Again, however, the picture is
complicated by the fact that a proportion of the
myeloma patients developing ANLL were also
irradiated.
A few studies have been carried out on the
carcinogenicity of melphalan in experimental ani-
mals, and have produced positive results. For
example, Shimkin et al. (74) reported that melphalan
increases the incidence of pulmonary tumors in
strain A mice, and the drug was also found to
increase the number of lung tumor nodules per
mouse from a control level of 0.5 to 4.5 (75).
Melphalan treatment also resulted in a significant
increase in the incidence of peritoneal sarcomas in
the CD rat (40).
The issue of the potential leukemogenicity of
melphalan is an important one because of its wide
clinical use, and the animal data are still rather
scanty and difficult to extrapolate to man. There-
fore, a study ofthe leukemogenic effects ofmelphalan
in nonhuman primates was initiated in this labora-
tory several years ago. A total of 20 monkeys is
currently being treated with melphalan at a dose
(1.2 mg/in2) comparable to that used clinically; they
receive the drug orally, 5 days every week. To date
(Table 3), one group of 10 monkeys has received an
average cumulative melphalan dose of 59.5 g/m2
over an average of 64 months. The second group
began receiving melphalan 10 months after treat-
ment of the first group had been initiated, and thus
far has ingested an average cumulative dose of 52.6
g/m2. In order to put these cumulative melphalan

doses into perspective, women receiving prophy-
lactic melphalan therapy for ovarian carcinoma
would receive in the prescribed 18 month dosing
period a total dose of 660 mg/M2 (76), a dose some
100-fold lower than that already ingested by these
monkeys. Moreover, the cumulative melphalan dose
administered to patients who subsequently developed
ANLL ranged between 0.19 g/m2 (57) and 5.1 g/m2
(73), with latent periods ranging from 2 to 105
months. None of the monkeys on the study have
died and all appear to be in good health. Thus, it
seems that ifmelphalan is a carcinogen in monkeys,
the latent period required for its carcinogenic
effects to become manifest is in excess of 5 years.

Thio-TEPA
Although this drug is no longer in wide use as an
antineoplastic agent, a number of case reports
published between 1970 and 1978 linked exposure
to thio-TEPA with the subsequent development of
ANLL. Thio-TEPA was the only chemotherapeutic
agent employed in the treatment of nine patients
with tumors (three with breast cancer, three with
ovarian carcinoma, two with lung cancer, and one
with bladder cancer) who developed ANLL (58, 62,
77-82). In two other patients, thio-TEPA was used
in combination with irradiation and chlorambucil or
cyclophosphamide (83, 84), and three women with
ovarian carcinoma received a combination of drugs
which included thio-TEPA prior to developing
ANLL (85, 86). Experimental studies have demon-
strated the carcinogenic effects ofthis drug in mice,
in which it produces lung tumors (75).
Chlorambucil
Chlorambucil is an alkylating agent which has
clinical activity against a variety of tumors and
which has also been found useful for treating
collagen vascular and other presumably autoimmune
disorders. A number of case reports have linked
prolonged treatment with this drug with the devel-
opment of ANLL in patients with nonmalignant
disease (87-95), including 20 with arthritis (89, 90,
92, 94), two with multiple sclerosis (89, 93), two
with Wegener's granulomatosis (91), four with
glomerulonephritis (93-95), and individuals with
malignant exophthalmia (87) and scleroderma (88).
In addition ANLL has been diagnosed in at least 24
patients after they had received chlorambucil for
other malignancies (56, 58, 96-107); these cases
included nine patients with Hodgkin's disease (96,
97, 105) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (56, 98, 99,
104), one patient with Waldenstrom's macroglo-
bulinemia (100), four patients with chronic lym-
phocytic leukemia (101, 102, 105), three patients
with breast cancer (107), and seven women with
ovarian or Fallopian tube carcinomas (58, 103, 106).
Many of these reports have come from France,
where chlorambucil is particularly popular. Chlor-
ambucil has carcinogenic activity in rodents, induc-
ing lymphosarcomas and pulmonary and ovarian
tumors in mice (40, 74, 75) and lymphomas in rats
(40). In view of the numerous case reports in which
prolonged chlorambucil treatment has been associated
with the development of ANLL and the positive
results with this drug in the rodent carcinogenesis
bioassay, it is highly likely that chlorambucil is a
human leukemogen.
98
Cyclophosphamide
Cyclophosphamide is a widely employed alkylating
agent useful as a single agent and as a component of
combination chemotherapy regimens. As with
chlorambucil, it is in increasing use for the treat-
ment of various nonmalignant conditions including
chronic glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis,
and other collagen-vascular disorders. As its use in
both malignant and nonmalignant disease has in-
creased, so has the number of reports linking
treatment with this drug to the development of
ANLL. Individuals developing ANLL after cyclo-
phosphamide treatment for nonmalignant disease
include six arthritis patients (89, 90, 92, 108), three
patients with chronic renal disease (109), and one
patient each with fibromatosis (110), Sjogren's
syndrome (111), Wegener's granulomatosis (112),
and macroglobulinemia (113). Moreover, ANLL
has been reported to be the terminal event in five
patients with multiple myeloma (71, 72, 113, 114),
two ovarian carcinoma patients (58), and four
women with breast cancer (115). Cyclophosphamide
has well-demonstrated carcinogenicity in rodents
(40, 74, 75, 116), and a study of its leukemogenic
potential in nonhuman primates was recently initi-
ated in this laboratory.
Chloramphenicol
This broad spectrum antibiotic was introduced
into clinical practice in 1948, since which time
numerous reports of its ability to cause bone-
marrow toxicity have appeared (117, 118). It has
been proposed that two types of marrow toxicity
are involved. One type, usually reversible upon
discontinuation of the drug, is dose-related and is
characterized by anemia and a normoceliular marrow.
The other type may be idiosyncratic since it
apparently is not dose-related, has a later onset,
and is characterized by an aplastic bone marrow,
pancytopenia, and a fatal outcome (119). Wallenstein
et al. (120) have estimated that the risk ofdeveloping
blood disorders after chloramphenicol treatment
lies somewhere between 1 in 24,500 and 1 in 40,800.
A certain proportion of patients with chloram-
phenicol-induced aplastic anemia develops ANLL
as a terminal event. Conversely, a few cases of
ANLL linked to chloramphenicol treatment have
been reported in which there was no history of
intervening cytopenia or aplasia (121-123). Exam-
ination of bone marrow cells in two cases of ANLL
presumed to have been caused by chloramphenicol
ingestion has revealed abnormal chromosome
morphology (124) and an abnormal karyotype with
a large telocentric marker chromosome (125). Despite
Environmental Health Perspectives
a number of case reports in which ANLL was
associated with chloramphenicol treatment (121-131),
Fraumeni's review (128) ofclinical and epidemiologic
information related to the outcome of patients with
chloramphenicol-induced bone marrow depression
failed to implicate the drug as clearly leukemogenic.
Unfortunately animal studies of chloramphenicol
carcinogenesis have not been informative. German
and Loc (132) reported that spleen homogenates
from chloramphenicol-treated mice produced tumors
when inoculated into recipient mice; however, other
studies in rats have shown that chloramphenicol
treatment exerts a protective effect against liver
tumor induction by fluorenylacetamide (133) and
diethylnitrosamine (134).
Phenylbutazone
Phenylbutazone is an anti-inflammatory agent
used in the treatment of rheumatic disorders and
for the therapy of acute gout. It is known to
produce bone marrow toxicity in some patients, and
late in the 1950's reports began appearing in the
literature linking treatment with this drug to
ANLL (135-138). Bean (139) reported six cases of
leukemia in patients who had received phenyl-
butazone, and Woodliff and Dougan (140) described
five cases of acute leukemia developing in patients
treated with phenylbutazone out of a total of 55
cases of acute leukemia diagnosed between 1959-1963
in Australia. Similarly, of50 cases ofacute leukemia
recorded in Scandinavia between 1959-1964, three
were diagnosed in individuals receiving phenyl-
butazone (141). Nevertheless, phenylbutazone does
not seem to be mutagenic (142, 143) or to induce
chromosomal damage in bone marrow cells of rats
(144) or hamsters (145), and a study ofits carcinogenic
activity in rats produced negative results (146).
Moreover, Fraumeni (128) failed to find an association
between phenylbutazone-induced myelosuppression
in 24 treated patients and the subsequent develop-
ment of ANLL.
Conclusions and
Recommendations
The human population may be exposed, either
intentionally in the form ofdrugs and food additives
or unintentionally as is the case with environmental
contaminants and pollutants, to potentially leuk-
emogenic agents. Despite the large number and the
diversity of these chemicals, only relatively few
have been implicated as human leukemogens, namely
benzene, several alkylating antitumor agents, chlor-
June 1981
amphenicol, and phenylbutazone. The association
between human ANLL and exposure to benzene
and the antitumor agents appears at present to be
stronger than it is for chloramphenicol and
phenylbutazone. It is possible that a given propor-
tion of individuals who develop bone marrow de-
pression as a consequence of chemical exposure
may ultimately develop ANLL regardless of which
agent produced the marrow toxicity, and indeed all
of the chemicals which have been implicated as
leukemogens can be myelosuppressive. Neverthe-
less, there are also chemicals which are potent
depressants of bone marrow function but that have
not been associated with human ANLL, and these
agents include methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside,
and the vinca alkaloids. Thus the relationship
between chemically induced bone marrow suppres-
sion and ANLL is not entirely clear.
Epidemiologic studies can give important and
meaningful clues to the leukemogenic potential of
drugs and chemicals in our environment, but only if
they are properly designed, properly controlled and
well executed. Unfortunately, many such studies in
the past have been flawed, their conclusions subject
to debate. Epidemiologic studies also have the
drawback of being expensive and time-consuming;
in addition, although they are usually able to define
specific populations at risk, they rarely are capable
of identifying single agents as causative factors.
More importantly, however, they are useful in
identifying a hazardous substance after exposure
has taken place, but obviously are not able to
prevent its introduction into the environment or
into clinical use.
One of the problems in avoiding human exposure
to potentially leukemogenic chemicals is the paucity
of animal models for evaluating such substances.
Although rodents are commonly used in carcinogen
bioassays, the only chemical which produces a high
yield ofANLL in rodents is N-butyl-N-nitrosourea,
and it appears that this malignancy is produced
only in rats. Besides man, the only species ofanimal
which develops ANLL in response to chemical
exposures is the Old World monkey. As with
epidemiologic surveys, however, studies of poten-
tial leukemogens in monkeys are costly and time-
consuming. This lack of suitable animal models
represents a major obstacle to identifying chemi-
cals as potential human leukemogens, and it would
be prudent during the next few years to direct
greater research effort toward developing new
models both in vitro and in animals, and more
effective utilization of existing animal models for
this neoplasm. The development and utilization of
in vitro and in vivo test systems will serve to
prevent potential leukemogens from entering the
99
human environment; future well designed and con-
trolled epidemiologic surveys will allow for the
identification of leukemogens already present. It is
only through these efforts that human leukemogens
can be detected and our exposure to them minimized.
