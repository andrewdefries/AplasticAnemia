MORPHOLOWC CHAN*E OF ADRENAL CORTEX IN DISEASE
Stimulation of the adrenal cortex by the "stress" of illness is now taken
for granted. Numerous publications have described changes in adrenal
cortical histology in particular diseases, and at least one author' has
attempted a general study of the adrenal cortex in an autopsy population.
Even so little attention is paid the adrenal cortex in the average autopsy
performed by the average pathologist. This is partly because such attention
is relatively unrewarding. In spite of the numerous publications devoted
to adrenal cortical histology, few are sufficiently well defined with respect
to age, sex, race, and types and duration of disease present. Few provide
sufficiently detailed data to serve as a frame of reference for the pathologist.
They do not tell how much hypertrophy is to be expected in a given
clinical situation, or how much to be considered extraordinary, nor do
they tell when lipid depletion is the "normal" response, and when it is
noteworthy. This paper is an attempt to provide sufficient data to make
such assessment possible.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
During a 20-month period (November 1959 to July 1961), adrenals from all
autopsies were placed intact in 10 per cent formalin for later examination by the
author. After fixation, the adrenals were carefully cleaned of adherent fat, blotted
dry, weighed,** and sectioned at approximately two to three mm. intervals. Two to
eight blocks from each adrenal pair were selected for microscopic examination. Routine
sections were stained with haemotoxylin and eosin (H and E). Adrenals from cirrhotic
patients with ascites and from 50 other randomly selected cases were also stained with
Wilder's reticulum stain.
The 407 consecutive autopsies performed during this 20-month period provided 335
pairs of adrenals suitable for accurate weighing. Seventy-two pairs were excluded for
the reasons shown in Table 1. However, material from some of these excluded cases

was available for microscopic examination. Clinical data were obtained by a review of
the patients' records and were supplemented by pathological observations.
Adrenal sections were examined by the author without knowledge of the clinical or
other autopsy data. The cortices were measured with a millimeter ruler. The presence
of the zona glomerulosa was noted, and its extent was graded on a scale of zero to
three-plus. Both H and E, and reticulum-stained sections were used for this purpose.
The extent of lipid depletion in the fasciculata-reticularis of the H and E stained
sections was graded on a scale of zero to four-plus. A grade of zero was given to those

glands without lipid depletion in any zone, one and two-plus grades constituted lipid
depletion of zona reticularis and inner fasciculata, three-plus when depletion extended
to the middle of the fasciculata, and four-plus when the entire thickness from reticularis
to outer fasciculata was lipid depleted. These data were then correlated with inde-
pendently obtained clinical data.
A control population (Table 2) was selected from the carefully weighed pairs by
excluding adrenals from Negro patients, steroid-treated patients (all patients receiving
steroids for more than one week) and adrenals containing large cortical nodules
(nodular hyperplasia) (Fig. 3, adrenal 6). The remaining 276 adrenal pairs were
considered the control population (i.e., nonsteroid-treated white males without nodular
hyperplasia).
Subgroups of the control population were selected to test associations between
adrenal weight and a particular type of disease. Some of the subgroups were selected

because of previous reports that adrenal hyperplasia and hyperfunction were associated
with carcinoma"5 and particularly with bronchogenic carcinoma,"'2 that adrenal
hyperplasia was associated with hypertension2' 8," and arteriosclerosis,2' and that
adrenal hypofunction was found in liver disease."2'
In analyzing the influence of disease on adrenal weight, patients were counted in
only one group even though they might have qualified for more than one group by
virtue of having more than one major disease. Thus all patients with cancer were
selected first, then patients with hypertension, liver disease, chronic pulmonary disease,
and severe arteriosclerosis (e.g., myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction), in that

order. This order was chosen after inspection of the data showed the larger glands
occurring more frequently in the first two groups.
While changes in adrenal weight reflect both duration of underlying disease and
intensity of the stimulating or inhibiting effects, changes in cortical lipid content
reflect morbid events during the few days preceding death. Therefore subgroups of
the control population selected to compare lipid content are based mainly on pre-
terminal events and differ from the weight groups.
Still a third grouping is necessary for consideration of the zona glomerulosa.
Increased aldosterone is known to occur in some cases of hypertension and cirrhosis
but not in cancer. Thus the presence of cancer in a patient with hypertension is
assumed to have little effect on the cortical zonation and for the purposes of this
analysis such an individual is grouped with the hypertensives.

Statistical methods
A lognormal distribution curve was obtained by plotting frequency on the ordinate
against paired adrenal weights grouped to the nearest gram on the abscissa of semi-log
paper (Fig. 1). Calculations of mean and standard deviations and statistical analyses
were performed with the logarithms of the adrenal weights rather than with the weights
themselves. The standard t test for comparison of meansS' was used to test separately
the significance of the differences between the control group mean and the means
of the steroid-treated and Negro groups. Heterogeneity within the control group was
examined by an analysis of variance.' Subgroups were also compared by means of the
chi-square test using the Yates correction." The four-place tables used in making
these comparisons are shown in Table 3.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
ADRENAL WEIGHT
Arithmetic distribution curves of weight are skewed; however, the
logarithms of the weights are "normally" distributed and the usual
statistical methods of determining the mean and standard deviation can
be applied to the logarithms themselves." Such a distribution is called
lognormal, and the antilog of the mean so obtained is the geometric mean.
Figure 1 shows the lognormal distribution of the control population.
35
YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
Table 4 shows the mean weights and the standard deviations of the various
groups. The differences between the mean weights of the control group
and the steroid-treated and Negro groups are significant (p>.001 in each
instance). A significantly lighter mean weight is expected in the steroid-
treated group since exogenous steroids suppress endogenous ACTH,
thereby producing adrenal atrophy.8' Support for this result comes from
comparison of the number of adrenals weighing less than seven grams

in the control and steroid-treated groups by means of the chi-square test
(Table 3, A). The result p>.Ol indicates more adrenal pairs weighing
less than two standard deviations in the steroid group than would be
expected by chance. Negro adrenals were originally excluded from the
control group because a lower mean weight for this group has been re-
ported.'M The above results are consistant with this finding. These con-
clusions assume that the control group is large enough to provide valid
values for the mean weight and standard deviation, and that the dis-
tribution of disease in the three main groups is random enough so that
the differences noted are due to steroid therapy in one group and race in
the other, and not to an increased frequency of a particular disease. Tables
5 and 6 give the appropriate data for the two groups.

A similar comparison between the subgroups means (Table 4) and
the control mean is not valid. The subgroup means could be compared
one with another or their total variance analyzed to determine the likeli-
hood of their being drawn by chance from a single population. The latter
analyses yielded p = .05, suggesting that some of the differences noted
are not simply chance.
Adrenal pairs exceeding a weight of plus two standard deviations from
the mean (22.1 grams) occurred only in patients with carcinoma. This
distribution was tested with the chi-square technique (Table 3, B) and
found significant (p = .05). The incidence of heavy adrenals in patients
with bronchogenic carcinoma was compared to that in patients with other
types of malignancy (Table 3, C.). A significant difference was not
found.

The preceding statistical comparisons also assume a random distribution
of age and body weight. In fact, age and body weight show little correlation
with adrenal weight. Table 7 shows no correlation of adrenal weight and
age, with the possible exception of the oldest age group where a tendency
toward lighter adrenals is noted. A recent study' has demonstrated
decreased cortisol metabolism by liver and impaired renal excretion of

Table 8 shows no correlation between adrenal weight and body weight,
with the possible exception of the largest individuals. This comparison is
not too reliable because of the rapid weight loss induced by disease.
Atrophic adrenals, not steroid-induced, were usually associated with
extreme cachexia.

ACTH, the lipid-laden cells of the fasciculata become transformed into
lipid-poor, RNA-rich cells identical with those in the zona reticularis.
Thus, the middle and inner zones represent the same cells in different
degrees of activity. The subcapsular zone, zona glomerulosa, has been
shown to produce aldosterone in the ox,' and to vary in thickness in re-
sponse to body electrolyte changes in the rat.' In the ox, rat, and dog
the zona glomerulosa is well defined, but in man it is a poorly defined
zone which varies from place to place and from individual to individual,
merging imperceptibly with the outer fasciculata.'-' Even so, in man,

histologic changes in this zone have been correlated with serum electro-
lyte imbalance and hypertension.'9 `
One author has attempted to cor-
relate the outer fasciculata rather than the glomerulosa with aldosterone
production.' Reticulum stain has been suggested as a valuable method
of identifying the zona glomerulosa."'
In the present study precise measurements were not attempted because
of the large series and inherent variability of the zona glomerulosa.
Instead, the subcapsular zone was appraised for distinctness and extent,
and graded on a scale of zero to three-plus. Repeat appraisal of 40
randomly selected cases after a lapse of three years showed agreement
in 31 cases (77%o). Reticulum stain did not facilitate grading.

The majority of glands (268 of 323) were graded zero to one-plus.
Six pairs were graded three-plus and 49 were two-plus. Electrolyte data
was available for two patients in the three-plus group. One of these, a
cirrhotic, had hyponatremia during the week preceding death. The other,
with cor pulmonale and emphysema, had normal electrolytes five days
prior to death. Of the remaining four cases graded three-plus, one had
cirrhosis, one septicemia, and two carcinoma (lung and sinus). Electro-
lytes were available for 17 of the 49 cases graded two-plus. Only two of
these had hyponatremia.
The grade two-plus and three-plus groups were combined for statistical
analysis. Among these 55 cases were nine hypertensives and five cirrhotics.

greater significance than the underlying disease. Thus most patients with
hypertension died from myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accidents
and were so classified. Sections were available from some adrenals not
suitable for weighing and vice versa. Categories with the least depletion
were cirrhosis, pulmonary insufficiency, and myocardial infarction.
Patients with severe sepsis showed the most marked lipid depletion.
Pseudotubule formation was frequently observed in completely depleted

glands, and a few showed focal infarction and necrosis. The two cases
excluded because of massive intramedullary hemorrhage were also cases
of severe sepsis. The significance of these observations is discussed in sub-
sequent sections.
LIPID DEPLETION IN RESPONSE TO INFECTION
Lipid depletion in response to severe acute bacterial infection was an
early and frequent observation."' Occasionally, in addition to lipid
depletion, degenerative changes (focal necrosis and pseudotubule for-
mation) are seen. Hemorrhagic cortical necrosis is an extreme form of
degeneration associated with gram-negative septicemia and particularly
meningococcemia. ' Berry and Smythe7 suggest that small amounts of
endotoxin stimulate the adrenal cortex, but large amounts are toxic
to it. More recently, attempts have been made to characterize this response
to sepsis. Nadel, et al,' compared the effects of ACTH and endotoxin,
and found that both increased excretion of three polar corticosteroids,
(6 (B)-hydroxycortisol, 2(a)hydroxycortisol, and cortisol) in vivo. How-
ever, Glenchur and Doe' measured plasma and urine 17-hydroxycorticos-
teroids in seven patients with bacterial pneumonia and found elevated
plasma levels but decreased urine levels. The half-life of exogenous cortisol
was increased. The authors suggest four possible mechanisms to explain
their findings: abnormal hepatic conjugation, renal retention of conjugates,
increased plasma protein binding, and increased conversion of cortisol
to 20-hydroxy forms.
The foregoing suggests that chronic sepsis would lead to adrenal hyper-
trophy, and this may be one of the stimuli to adrenal hyperplasia in some
cancer patients whose long illnesses are complicated by repeated or
persistent sepsis.
EFFECT OF STEROID TREATMENT
The earliest and most consistent effect of steroid treatment is decreased
lipid depletion.e' While prolonged steroid administration leads to cortical
atrophy, this is presumably a reflection of endogenous ACTH suppression
by the exogenous steroid. Extreme atrophy (less than 7.0 grams) occurred
in four steroid-treated individuals. Two of these (cases A60-73 and A61-
28, see Table 5) received steroids continuously for at least one year.
Case A60-143, subacute hepatic necrosis, received 1,500 mg. of prednisone
over a 37-day interval. The severe liver damage may have potentiated
the steroid effect. Case A60-73 received only 635 mg. of prednisone over
43
YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
a 20-day interval, and died in status asthmaticus during the first night
of reduced dosage. The combined adrenal weight of 6.6 grams would
seem to be an inordinate amount of atrophy for a relatively short period
of treatment. This patient's adrenal atrophy may have preceded treat-
ment and may have been related to the late and sudden onset of severe
asthma.'

ADRENAL RESPONSE TO CARCINOMA
Fulminant Cushing's syndrome in association with "non-endocrine" car-
cinoma is a well-established clinical entity. These cases are summarized in
several recent reviews.6" The adrenal hyperplasia and hyperfunction
is stimulated by ACTH-like peptides produced by the cancer. The
general or specific nature of this phenomenon is still in question. Several
recent studies of blood and urine steroid levels in patients with bron-
chogenic carcinoma have shown elevated baseline steroid levels and hyper-
responsiveness to ACTH when compared to a variety of control groups.8' '
Other authors have attempted to demonstrate anatomic evidence of
adrenal hyperplasia in patients dying of bronchogenice0 and other types
of carcinoma.' It can be seen from Table 4 that the mean adrenal weight
for patients with bronchogenic carcinoma was slightly higher than other
nonhypertensive groups. Both carcinoma groups show greater deviation
from the mean than other groups. All of the adrenals exceeding plus-two
standard deviations from the control mean were associated with car-
cinoma (Table 10). These data support the suggestion that cancer is
occasionally associated with adrenal hyperplasia. However, the frequency

cluded. Patients with nodular adrenals and hypertension are considered
in the next section. The mean weight for this group was slightly higher
than other groups (Table 4) and all but one had lipid-laden glands. Lack
of lipid depletion may be related to terminal events, since most died
suddenly from myocardial infarctions or cerebral accidents (Table 11).
Since most of the nodules removed from patients with primary aldos-
teronism have had a lipid-laden fascicular pattern, one author' has sug-
gested that lipid-rich adrenals from hypertensives may also be producing
excessive aldosterone. However, this same author and others1'X have also
suggested that this lipid-laden appearance of the adrenal cortex simply
reflects arteriolar disease in the adrenal capsule. Certainly a lipid-rich
cortex does not suggest excessive ACTH stimulation.
Nodular hyperplasia
Several authors have correlated nodular adrenals with hypertension
and arteriosclerosis.8"u' 17.20.X X4 Common features in these observations
were lipid-laden glands and elderly patients. While some authors have sug-
gested that nodular adrenals are related causally to hypertension7 and

arteriosclerosis,"' others have considered the adrenal changes degenerative
secondary to arterial disease."
Clinical data from patients with nodular adrenals segregated in this
study are presented in Table 12. Of the 16 cases, only two were under 60.
Five had documented hypertension and ten had severe manifestations of
arteriosclerosis. None of these incidences is statistically significant when
tested by the chi-square technique (Table 3 D,E,F).

CIRRHOSIS
Recent studies have shown impaired metabolism of hydrocortisone in
cirrhotic patients. The half-life of infused exogenous cortisol is doubled."
Since the miscible pool of cortisol is normal in these individuals, sup-
pression of endogenous ACTH and decreased cortical stimulation is
probable.' Both the weight and lipid depletion data obtained in this
study are consistent with ACTH suppression. The mean weight is less
than other nonsteroid-treated groups (Table 4) and relatively little lipid
depletion is noted (Fig. 2).
PULMONARY INSUFFICIENCY
Patients were placed in this group on the basis of clinical and autopsy
evidence of severe lung damage (e.g., emphysema, fibrosis, advanced tuber-

culosis, and cor pulmonale). Available information on the extent of pul-
monary impairment during life is recorded in Table 13. The striking
feature in this group is lack of lipid depletion (Fig. 2). This is inter-
preted as lack of or diminished pituitary response to the stress of chronic
dyspnea. Normal plasma and urine levels of 170HCS and normal re-
sponsiveness to ACTH have been recorded in patients with chronic
pulmonary disease and dyspnea.'

Three cases of myelolipomata were encountered in this series. This
is higher than a previously reported incidence.' One unusual microscopic
metastasis was noted. This was metastatic Kaposi sarcoma in a patient
with Kaposi's sarcoma of limbs and bowel and adenocarcinoma of the
stomach. None of the adrenals containing metastases were completely
replaced, nor did any of the patients manifest adrenal insufficiency. A
breakdown of gross adrenal metastases is presented in Table 14.
SUMMARY
Morphologic observations made on 335 intact pairs of adrenal glands
obtained from 407 autopsies are correlated with clinical data.
Adrenal weight follows a lognormal distribution (geometric mean 12.9
gms., plus or minus 2 S.D., 7.5 gms. to 22.1 gms.). The geometric means
5o

obtained from Negro patients and steroid-treated white patients were
significantly lower than the mean for white males not on steroids.
Comparison of adrenal weight with body weight and patient's age
showed little correlation except at the extremes of age and weight.
Adrenal weight correlated well with cortical thickness.
Adrenal pairs exceeding a weight of 22.1 gms. occurred only in patients
with carcinoma. Hyperplastic glands occurred with equal frequency in
bronchogenic and other types of malignancy. Two cases of Cushing's syn-
drome occurred in patients with oat cell carcinoma. Glands from these
individuals showed a quantitatively distinctive type of hypertrophy.
Cases with nodular hyperplasia were not included in weight data
but were analyzed separately. Nodular hyperplasia did not correlate
with age or disease.
Sections were graded with respect to the thickness of zona glomerulosa
and extent of lipid depletion in the fasciculata-reticularis. Variations in the
zona glomerulosa did not correlate with cirrhosis, hypertension, or renal
disease. Lipid depletion of the fasciculata-reticularis was most striking
in severe sepsis. Little cortical lipid depletion was seen in cases of decom-
pensated cirrhosis and pulmonary insufficiency. This may represent
diminished ACTH release in these "stressful" states.
