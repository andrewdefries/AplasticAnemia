ABSTRACT
There are at least three human diseases that are
associated with germ-line mutations of the genes
encoding the two essential components of telomer-
ase, TERT and TERC. Heterozygous mutations of
these genes have been described for patients with
dyskeratosis congenita, bone marrow failure and
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we will
detail the clinical similarities and difference of these
diseases and review the molecular phenotypes
observed. The spectrum of mutations in TERT and
TERC varies for these diseases and may in part
explain the clinical differences observed.
Environmental insults and genetic modifiers that
accelerate telomere shortening and increase cell
turnover may exaggerate the effects of telomerase
haploinsufficiency, contributing to the variability of
age of onset as well as tissue-specific organ
pathology. A central still unanswered question is
whether telomerase dysfunction and short telo-
meres are a much more prominent factor than
previously suspected in other adult-onset,
age-related diseases. Understanding the biological
effects of these mutations may ultimately lead to
novel treatments for these patients.
INTRODUCTION
Telomeres are repetitive, non-coding DNA [TTAGGG]
elements at the ends of chromosomes. Telomerase is a
multimeric ribonucleoprotein complex consisting of at
least a functional RNA (hTR) that contains the template
region complementary to the telomeric sequence (1) and a
reverse transcriptase protein component (hTERT) that
catalyzes the addition of telomeric repeats to the ends of
chromosomes (2,3). hTR is expressed in all tissues but
hTERT is only highly expressed in speciﬁc germ line cells,
proliferative stem cells of renewal tissues, and immortal
cancer cells (4–9). In most human somatic cells, telomeres
shorten with each cell division due to incomplete lagging
DNA strand synthesis (10–12) and oxidative damage
(13,14). Even cells that express telomerase (e.g. peripheral
blood mononuclear cells and other stem-like cells)
undergo telomere shortening with age (15,16). Telomere
lengths are aﬀected by their starting set points, the cellular
activity of telomerase, the cell’s history of cell division and
environmental eﬀects. Overexpression of the catalytic
subunit of human telomerase (hTERT) induces telomerase
activity and telomere elongation (17).
While there is substantial evidence for replicative
senescence in cell culture models that is associated with
telomere attrition, the evidence for in vivo telomere
shortening actually contributing to human aging has been
diﬃcult to document. There is agreement that telomeres are
shorter in older individuals as compared to younger
individuals (12,18), but proving that telomere dysfunction
causes age-related pathology has been diﬃcult to rigor-
ously test because it is not easy (technically or ethically) to
restore telomere length in humans. Rodent animal models
do not provide an optimal system for testing the
importance of telomeres in human aging. In addition,
there is considerable heterogeneity of telomere length
between humans and also diﬀerences between tissues and
cell types within an individual. This makes it very diﬃcult
to directly link telomere shortening as a proximal cause of
aging. Only some cells in a given tissue may have critically
shortened telomeres as a consequence of replicative
exhaustion leading to cell senescence. This small fraction
of senescent cells may interfere with the function of
otherwise normal tissues by expression of degradative
enzymes that can destroy tissue architecture and by
secretion of inﬂammatory cytokines and growth factors
that cause local activation of neighboring cells (19). Thus,
central questions include what is the minimal threshold of
senescent cells and what is the identity of senescent cells
that can change the homeostasis of a speciﬁc tissue leading
to a decline in tissue function?

The relevance of telomere shortening induced by
dysfunctional telomerase to physiological aging is sug-
gested by the phenotypes of a telomerase deﬁcient mouse
model (20,21). Early generations of mTRÀ/À
mice do not
show abnormalities presumably because laboratory mice
have a much longer telomere length (20–150 kb) than
humans (5–15 kb). However, late generations of mTRÀ/À
mice have defects in cell viability of highly proliferative
tissues. They have a shorter life span compared with wild-
type mice and show hair loss/early graying of hair,
decreased capacity for wound healing and a slight
increased incidence of cancer. However, the telomerase-
deﬁcient mouse models may not completely mirror human
diseases of telomerase dysfunction as they have longer
telomeres (20,22), express telomerase activity in most
tissues (23,24) and do not use telomere shortening as a
counting mechanism (25).
The most widely accepted hypothesis is that the major
function of clonal attenuation and replicative aging in
humans is to form a barrier against the development of
cancer. The number of permitted cell divisions may
represent a balance between providing enough cell turn-
overs to provide maintenance and repair of tissues and
limiting the number of times a cell can divide to prevent
cancer. Few stone-age human ancestors lived beyond
30–40 years of age before dying, usually from infections
(26). There may have been selective pressure to have a
suﬃcient number of cell divisions to provide for reason-
able ﬁtness until the time one was likely to have died
(by age 40), but additional capacity for cell division
beyond this point would come at the expense of a greater
risk of cancer (27). In the modern era humans live beyond
their historical lifespan and, as a consequence, the limit on
replicative capacity may have physiological consequences
that contribute to the pathologies of aging. Rare inherited
diseases described below provide additional evidence
that telomerase dysfunction and short telomeres play a
role in certain age-related human diseases.
During the past few years, experimental evidence has
been obtained suggesting that telomere shortening may be
causative for three diﬀerent human disorders. These are
dyskeratosis congenita (DKC), multiple diﬀerent diseases
collectively characterized by bone marrow failure and
idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis (IPF). In this review, we will
summarize the evidence for telomere dysfunction in these
conditions. The review will end with speculation on the
future for telomere therapy that may lead to novel
interventions to slow down or even reverse disease
progression.
DYSKERATOSIS CONGENITA (DKC)
DKC is a rare inherited multisystem disorder character-
ized by the triad of reticulated skin pigmentation,
nail dystrophy and white patches (leukoplakia) in the
mouth. The prevalence is approximately 1 in 1 000 000
individuals, with death occurring at a median age of
16 (28). Patients typically appear healthy at birth and
develop the mucocutaneous features later in life as well as
a wide range of somatic abnormalities including bone
marrow, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, skeletal,
urologic, immunologic and neurologic abnormalities.
Bone marrow failure is the leading cause of death,
followed by pulmonary disease and cancer.
There is both clinical and genetic heterogeneity of
DKC. Most aﬀected patients in families in a large
international registry of DKC are male, suggesting an
X-linked pattern of inheritance (29). Almost all the
patients in this group develop the mucocutaneous
features of the disease during the ﬁrst two decades of
life. Bone marrow failure is especially common and severe.
Over 85% of patients have a peripheral cytopenia of at
least one lineage and 76% develop pancytopenia at a
median age of 10 years. Other families exhibit an
autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern of
inheritance.
Mutations in genes involved with telomere maintenance
have been identiﬁed in $40% of clinically diagnosed DKC
cases (30). A positional cloning approach led to the
identiﬁcation of mutations in the gene DKC1 encoding
dyskerin for the X-linked recessive form of the disease
(31). Dyskerin is a nucleolar protein that copuriﬁes with
the RNA component (hTR) and protein component of
telomerase (hTERT) in the catalytically active human
complex (32). It is one of four proteins found to
be associated with the telomerase complex (Figure 1).
Cell lines from patients with X-linked DKC have reduced
levels of hTR that limit telomere length (33,34). Aﬀected
males have one copy of the X-linked DKC1 gene and their
cells express only the mutated form of dyskerin. Most
mutations are missense changes that result in single amino
acid substitutions that cluster in two regions, the
N-terminal domain and the archaeosine-speciﬁc
Figure 1. Schematic structure of the telomerase complex and diseases
associated with mutations in the genes encoding each protein within the
complex. TERT, hTR, dyskerin, NOP10, NHP2 and GAR1 constitute
the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex. Mutations in the genes
TERT or TERC (encoding hTR) are associated with autosomal
dominant pulmonary ﬁbrosis, bone marrow failure syndromes and
DKC. Mutations in DKC1, encoding dyskerin, cause X-linked recessive
DKC. Autosomal recessive DKC has been described in one family with
a homozygous mutation in NOLA3, encoding NOP10.

transglycosylase (PUA) domain (35). By homology with
the crystal structure of a bacterial ortholog of dyskerin,
both of these domains are predicted to play a role in
binding of hTR (36,37).
Several diﬀerent deletion and nucleotide substitution
mutations in the TERC gene, encoding hTR, were ﬁrst
found in patients with the rare autosomal dominant form
of DKC (38,39). Many of these mutations aﬀect in vitro
hTR accumulation and/or catalytic activity (40) but all
demonstrate in vivo telomere length shortening (discussed
below). Subsequently, missense mutations in the gene
TERT, encoding the protein component of telomerase,
have been described in patients with DKC (30,41,42).
Aﬀected individuals with mutations in either gene
(TERC or TERT) have shorter telomere lengths than
age-matched controls. Autosomal dominant inheritance
can arise from a dominant negative eﬀect through
interaction and inhibition of the wild-type product by
the mutated gene product in a multiprotein complex.
Alternatively, autosomal dominant inheritance can arise
from haploinsuﬃciency with a reduction in the normal
level of telomerase due to one mutated copy of the gene.
In most cases, the eﬀect of the mutations of these two
genes appears to be consistent with a mechanism of
haploinsuﬃciency (41,43,44).
Homozygosity mapping of one large consanguineous
Saudi Arabian family with autosomal recessive DKC led
to the identiﬁcation of a homozygous missense mutation
in NOLA3 (encoding the protein NOP10) that segregated
with the phenotype (45). This mutation is predicted to
result in an arginine to tryptophan substitution (R34W) in
a highly conserved region of the protein NOP10, one of
four proteins associated with the telomerase complex
(Figure 1) (46). None of the 15 other autosomal recessive
families showed linkage to this region and none of the
probands (index cases) of 171 uncharacterized DKC
families had rare sequence variants in this gene, under-
scoring the rarity of mutations in this gene as a cause
of DKC (45).
Regardless of the pattern of genetic inheritance, all
patients with DKC have very short telomeres, implying a
common pathway underlying the mechanism of this
disease (33,39,41,47). When patients with DKC1 muta-
tions are categorized by disease severity, those with the
most severe phenotypes have shorter telomeres than those
with the mildest phenotypes (age over 15 years with no co-
existent aplastic anemia) (30). Using the telomere ﬂow-
FISH assay and a cut oﬀ of total leukocyte telomere
lengths below the ﬁrst percentile, DKC patients could be
distinguished from their unaﬀected relatives with 100%
sensitivity and 90% speciﬁcity (48). Interestingly, DKC
families with mutations in either TERC or TERT
demonstrate genetic anticipation with a worsening of
disease severity and an earlier onset of symptoms with
successive generations (39,41). The onset and severity of
disease correlates with progressive telomere shortening
in later generations. Siblings that do not inherit the
mutated TERC gene do not have symptoms. Even though
these siblings inherit short telomeres from the aﬀected
parent, the non-mutated telomerase preferentially acts on
the shortest telomeres to normalize their lengths (49).
Thus, DKC patients have to inherit both short
telomeres and have a mutation in one of the components
of telomerase in order to show anticipation. This is a new
mechanism underlying genetic anticipation. Instead of
ampliﬁcation of triplet repeats as is frequently seen in
neurodegenerative disorders (50), in DKC there is a
‘contraction’ of telomere repeats.
Most clinical presentations of DKC are associated with
an impaired proliferative capacity of tissues. For example,
skin ﬁbroblasts from DKC patients have a longer
doubling time and abnormal chromosomal rearrange-
ments in cell culture (51). In addition, the number of
hematopoietic progenitor cells is decreased in DKC
patients (52). The tissues requiring constant renewal,
i.e. skin, oral mucosa and bone marrow are the ones that
are aﬀected most frequently in DKC.
Connection between sporadic bone marrow failure and
dyskeratosis congenita
Over 80% of patients with DKC have bone marrow
failure, usually characterized by aplastic anemia or a
reduction in all three blood cell lineages (53). Because of
this, DKC can be considered one of the inherited bone
marrow failure syndromes. After mutations in TERC were
ﬁrst described for patients with the rare autosomal
dominant form of DKC (38), it was noted that the clinical
phenotypes of mutation carriers were often only bone
marrow failure without the mucocutaneous features
typical of this disease (54). This led to the sequencing of
TERC for patients with either the familial or sporadic
forms of various bone marrow failure syndromes.
Subsequently, diﬀerent mutations in TERC have been
found in patients with aplastic anemia (43,54–58),
myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukemia
arising from myelodysplastic syndrome (30,56,59), parox-
ysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (60) and essential
thrombocytosis (43). A similar sequencing strategy led to
the identiﬁcation of mutations in the gene encoding the
protein component of telomerase, TERT, in patients with
aplastic anemia (42,58,61,62). A number of diﬀerent
mutations in both TERC and TERT have been found in
patients with bone marrow failure syndromes (Figure 2).
Again, most variants in either gene lead to reduced
telomerase activity by haploinsuﬃciency, except for two
diﬀerent mutations in TERC that aﬀect the template
domain of hTR and which appear to have a dominant
negative eﬀect (58).
Telomere shortening of circulating leukocytes is
observed in many of the diﬀerent inherited bone marrow
failure syndromes. Some patients with these disorders
have short telomeres and deﬁned mutations in TERC or
TERT, as described above. For others, the connection
between accelerated telomere shortening and reduced
telomerase activity is not clear. Shwachman-Diamond
syndrome (SDS) is an autosomal recessive syndrome
characterized by bone marrow failure, pancreatic
exocrine insuﬃciency, skeletal defects, an increased risk
of hematologic cancers and abnormal telomere shortening
(63,64). Mutations in the gene SBDS are found in >90%
of patients with SDS (65). Indirect evidence suggests that
7408 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 22
the SBDS gene product may function in RNA metabolism
(65). There is no evidence of a reduction in telomerase
activity in lymphocytes from SDS patients or a physical
interaction between the SBDS gene product and
the telomerase complex of hTR and hTERT (65,66).
Short telomeres have also been seen in subpopulations
of patients with aplastic anemia (67–69), paroxysmal
nocturnal hemoglobinuria (70) and Fanconi’s anemia (71),
suggesting that short telomeres of circulating leukocytes
may be a marker of progenitor cell depletion in sporadic
cases of several bone marrow failure syndromes.
IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS
Idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis (IPF) is a progressive,
fatal lung disease characterized by lung scarring and
abnormal gas exchange (72). The disease is rare in children
and typically aﬀects individuals age 50 or more, with
the incidence increasing with advanced age (73). The
prevalence is 4 per 100 000 in adults aged 18–34 years but
increases to over 227 per 100 000 among those 75 years
and older. The disease is more common in men and in
smokers (74,75). There are approximately 89 000 persons
diagnosed with IPF in the United States, with about
34 000 new cases diagnosed each year (74). IPF is
always fatal with no spontaneous remission. The median
life span after diagnosis is usually between 2.5 and
3.5 years (76).
The clinical presentation of IPF is similar to that of all
the scarring lung diseases, collectively called interstitial
lung diseases, which lead to pulmonary ﬁbrosis and
symptoms of a chronic cough and shortness of breath.
Patients with IPF have abnormal pulmonary function
tests (PFTs) reﬂecting a restrictive respiratory pattern
coupled with evidence of lung scarring, characteristically
involving the periphery of the lower lobes of the lung.
The diagnosis of IPF is supported by thorascopic lung
biopsy, which reveals a histological pattern of ‘usual
interstitial pneumonia’ (UIP), with ﬁbroblastic foci at the
interface between normal and scarred lung. In the absence
of a surgical lung biopsy, IPF can be diagnosed after other
known causes of PF are excluded and certain clinical
criteria have been met using spirometry to assess lung
function, high resolution computed tomography (CT) of
the chest to assess lung morphology, and a transbronchial
lung biopsy or bronchoalveolar ﬂuid (BAL) to rule out
alternative diagnoses (76). Over one hundred diﬀerent
clinical interstitial lung diseases are associated with
PF, including connective tissue diseases, occupational
exposures, drug toxicities and other primary diseases of
the lung. If no culprit can be identiﬁed, the interstitial lung
disease may represent a class of lung disease called
idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP). These have been
further classiﬁed (77) to assist with predicting clinical
course and outcome. IPF is the most common of all the
IIPs and also the most deadly, with no deﬁnitive medical
treatments. Lung transplantation is an option for younger
patients.
A small subset of patients with IPF has a familial form
of the disease. The ﬁrst large collection of familial
IPF families was reported just 7 years ago by Marshall
and his colleagues who identiﬁed 25 families (including
67 cases) (78). They estimated that familial cases account
for 0.5–2.2% of all cases of IPF, with a prevalence of
1.3 cases per million. The familial form of IPF accounts
for 3.3–3.7% of all cases in Finland with geographic
clustering of the familial cases suggesting a founder
eﬀect (79). In cohorts of patients with early onset disease,

syndromes (orange) and pulmonary ﬁbrosis (black). Mutations in TERC, encoding hTR and TERT have been described for patients with DKC
(30,38,39,88) and bone marrow failure syndromes including aplastic anemia (30,43,54–58), myelodysplastic syndrome (56,59) and essential
thrombocytemia (43). Rare mutations in TERC have been found in patients with familial pulmonary ﬁbrosis (86,87). Mutations in TERT have been
found in patients with DKC (30,41), familial pulmonary ﬁbrosis (86,87) and aplastic anemia (42,58,61,62). Common genetic polymorphisms and
promoter mutations are not shown. The schematic depiction of the predicted secondary structure of hTR is indicated (103); mutations in TERT are
shown relative to conserved domains (3,104,105).
Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 22 7409
such as those referred for lung transplantation, the
incidence of the familial form of the disease has been
reported to be much higher, up to 14–19% (80,81).
The pattern of inheritance in most families is consistent
with an autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete
penetrance (78,81–83).
The clinical presentation of familial IPF in the United
Kingdom appears to be indistinguishable from sporadic
IPF except that the age of onset tends to be younger
(84,85). The mean age at diagnosis is 55.5 years for
familial IPF compared to 67.4–69.8 years in sporadic IPF.
In familial IPF, males outnumber females, with a ratio
of 1.75:1. Half of the cases in families are smokers.
In another collection of over 100 families with IPF, older
age, male sex and smoking cigarettes were strongly
associated with the development of the disease (83).
An autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance was seen
in 20% of these families. Within the families, aﬀected
individuals have radiographic and/or histopathologic
features consistent with two or even three diﬀerent types
of IIP, suggesting that the inherited genetic factor(s)
confer an increased risk for the development of pulmonary
ﬁbrosis in response to injury, but not an absolute risk for
one particular histologic subtype of IIP.
Connections between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and
telomere dysfunction
A clue to the molecular basis of familial IPF emerged from
studies performed simultaneously by two groups using
diﬀerent approaches: Armanios and her colleagues at
Johns Hopkins used a candidate gene approach (86) while
our group used a non-biased whole genome mapping
approach (87). Armanios had previously described a
family with autosomal dominant DKC with haploinsuﬃ-
ciency of telomerase due to a missense mutation in the
reverse transcriptase domain of TERT in which four of
the seven aﬀected individuals were diagnosed with
idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis between 21 and 63 years
of age. She and her colleagues subsequently sequenced
TERT in probands of a collection of 73 kindreds with
familial IPF. They identiﬁed six probands (8%) with
mutations; ﬁve were heterozygous for mutations in TERT
and one was heterozygous for a mutation in TERC.
The telomere lengths in lymphocytes from these aﬀected
individuals were all less than the 10th percentile when
compared to age-matched controls.
Taking an unbiased genetic approach, we performed a
whole genome linkage scan in two large families with
familial IPF. We found evidence of linkage to the short
arm of chromosome 5 in a small region that contained the
TERT gene. Since a mutation in this gene had been
previously found in a DKC family in which many of the
aﬀected individuals had pulmonary ﬁbrosis (41), we
considered this to be an excellent candidate gene.
Heterozygous mutations in TERC or TERT are seen in
$12% of our cohort of families; TERT mutations were
found not only in the two large families used for the
linkage analysis but also in four other kindreds with
familial pulmonary ﬁbrosis, and a TERC mutation was
found in an additional family (87). The mutations in
TERT segregated not only with individuals that met the
strict diagnosis of IPF, but also several with pulmonary
ﬁbrosis favoring the upper lobes of the lung and others
with unclassiﬁed pulmonary disease. Several family
members of these kindreds with no self-reported lung
problems were identiﬁed to be heterozygous for a mutant
TERT allele; thus, the pulmonary disease was not
completely penetrant. We have found that almost 70%
of telomerase mutation carriers over the age of 40 have
pulmonary disease of some kind. More than one-third has
osteoporosis or osteopenia aﬀecting the axial skeleton.
While this condition may have been exacerbated by
corticosteroid treatment that is frequently given to
patients with pulmonary ﬁbrosis, in half the cases this
diagnosis either preceded steroid treatment or occurred
independently of a diagnosis of pulmonary ﬁbrosis.
A mild to moderate anemia (hematocrit of 23–32%) and
several cancers (lymphoma, breast, skin) were occasionally
found among the telomerase mutations carriers in the
kindreds with familial pulmonary ﬁbrosis. Thus, our
preliminary ﬁndings indicate that the clinical phenotypes
of anemia and osteoporosis may provide additional
clinical indices of disease in IPF families due to telomerase
mutations.
The mutations in TERT found in kindreds with
familial IPF are diﬀerent from those previously found in
patients with DKC or bone marrow failure (Figure 2B).
Three identiﬁed mutations are nucleotide deletions that
are predicted to create frameshifts and truncated proteins.
As predicted, the V747fs frameshift mutations missing
half the reverse transcriptase domain had undetectable
in vitro telomerase activity. Co-translation of diﬀerent
ratios of plasmids encoding the V747fs protein and the
wild-type TERT protein did not negatively aﬀect the
activity of the wild-type protein, suggesting a mechanism
of haploinsuﬃciency (87). The other two identiﬁed
deletion mutants, P122fs and E1116fs, are predicted to
delete most of the protein or just the terminal 17 amino
acids of the protein containing the conserved E-IV
domain, respectively. The latter mutation has almost
undetectable in vitro telomerase activity (87).
The other identiﬁed mutations in TERT in patients with
familial pulmonary ﬁbrosis are missense and splice site
mutations. The missense mutations demonstrate a range
of 30–100% wild-type telomerase activity in conventional
rabbit reticulocyte in vitro assays (87). The missense
mutations span all the diﬀerent functional domains of
the protein. There is a cluster of three independent
mutations in the motif C region of the reverse transcrip-
tase domain. We found the R865H mutation in motif
C that segregated in one of the large families used in the
original linkage scan. Sequencing TERT in 44 individuals
with sporadic IIPs identiﬁed one individual with a
mutation involving the same amino acid residue, R866C.
Armanios et al. also identiﬁed a mutation that results
in selective skipping of exon 10, which encodes motif C
(86). These three independent mutations in motif C in IPF
patients suggest a potential genotype–phenotype
relationship.
Only two diﬀerent mutations in TERC have been
described in kindreds with familial IPF. One mutation,
7410 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 22
37a > g, aﬀecting the terminal residue of the P1b helix that
functions in the hTR template boundary deﬁnition,
was previously identiﬁed in a patient with DKC and
severe aplastic anemia who is a compound heterozygote
for mutations in TERC (88). It was not reported whether
family members with the same mutation had any signs or
symptoms of pulmonary ﬁbrosis. A second mutation in
TERC was found in a family with pulmonary ﬁbrosis and
aplastic anemia. Mutations in TERC thus appear more
likely associated with DKC and bone marrow failure
syndromes than familial pulmonary ﬁbrosis.
When compared with age-matched normal controls,
individuals heterozygous for all the identiﬁed mutations in
TERT or TERC had shorter telomere lengths of circulat-
ing white blood cells (86,87). When these lengths were
compared between individuals belonging to the same
large family with the R865H mutation in TERT, the
younger heterozygous mutation carriers had telomere
lengths similar to age-matched controls. In contrast,
many of the mutation carriers older than 40 had telomeres
with a shorter mean length and an increased proportion
of short telomeres. Haploinsuﬃciency of telomerase
due to TERT mutations may lead to the clinical pheno-
type of pulmonary ﬁbrosis only after suﬃcient time has
elapsed and after multiple rounds of cell division have
occurred to shorten telomeres to critical lengths. This may
explain why individuals present with this disease later in
life, as adults. IPF is an age-related disease, with markedly
increased prevalence with advanced age, especially after
the ﬁfth decade of life. Some fraction of sporadic cases is
likely due to telomere attrition from age and environ-
mental insults independent of speciﬁc genetic mutations.
Comparisons between DKC, bone marrow failure
syndromes and IPF
Table 1 compares the clinical characteristics of these
diseases associated with mutations in genes encoding the
telomerase complex. Is telomere shortening a common
molecular mechanism underlying them all? With rare
exceptions, telomere lengths of circulating cells, cultured
ﬁbroblasts and lymphoblasts, or of genomic DNA isolated
from leukocytes are all abnormally short for patients with
DKC, bone marrow failure and IPF with mutations in
genes associated with the telomerase complex. In general,
the shorter telomeres are associated with earlier onset and
more severe phenotypes. This is seen most dramatically in
families with genetic anticipation.
But how can mutations in the same genes lead to such
diﬀerent clinical presentations? We believe that the
resulting phenotype is likely determined by genotype,
time and tissue-speciﬁc environmental eﬀects. As seen in
Figure 2, diﬀerent mutations in TERC and TERT are
found in patients with diﬀerent clinical diseases.
Mutations in TERC are usually found in patients with
DKC or bone marrow failure. Mutations in TERT have
been found more often in patients with IPF or bone
marrow failure than those with the classic skin features of
DKC. In addition to the eﬀect of the mutations upon
telomere length, these mutations may have other cellular
eﬀects. For example, DKC patients with NOLA3, DKC1
and TERC mutations show signiﬁcantly reduced levels of
hTR RNA expression in whole blood than controls or
patients with TERT mutations (45). In addition, hTR
has been shown to have functions that are separable from
its role in telomerase (89,90). In particular, hTR has
recently been implicated as a negative regulator of ATR
activity (86). It is possible that some classes of stem cells
are programmed to leave the stem cell compartment in
response to sub-lethal DNA damage signals, in order to
reduce the likelihood of cancer. The increased hemato-
poietic/mucocutaneous prominence in DKC versus IPF
may reﬂect a preferential exhaustion of progenitors in the
marrow and skin due to this non-telomeric eﬀect of hTR.
There is no evidence of loss of heterozygosity in aﬀected
lung tissue to explain the lung-speciﬁc ﬁbrosis seen with
germline TERT mutations (data not shown).
Telomere lengths are decreased not only in IPF patients
with TERT mutations, but also in mutation carriers
within the same family without lung disease (87),
suggesting that other factors inﬂuence the clinical expres-
sion of IPF associated with TERT mutations.
Environmental factors may inﬂuence cell proliferation or
the rate of telomere loss in an organ-speciﬁc manner.
Cigarette smoking has been associated with a dose-
dependent shortening of telomere lengths of circulating
leukocytes (91), and this eﬀect may be magniﬁed in lung
tissue. In our study, mutation carriers of TERT or TERC
with a past history of smoking died on average 10 years
earlier than non-smokers (58 years versus 68 years) (87).
In family F11, one individual who was a non-smoker with

liver cirrhosis of unknown etiology had the same inherited
TERT mutation as the proband with IPF who was a
previous cigarette smoker (87). The full spectrum of
phenotypes associated with TERT mutations is likely
to grow as more heterozygous mutation carriers are
identiﬁed. As discussed above, IPF associated with
heterozygous TERT mutations is always diagnosed in
adults, not children, suggesting that age is important in
the pathogenesis of disease. Older adults have a greater
magnitude of cumulative environmental exposures
than children. With the passage of time, there is further
telomere shortening with cell proliferation and replicative
exhaustion.
A key feature of the disease process in DKC is that
there is a failure of proliferative tissues that are dependent
upon renewal by stem cell activity. In a model initially
proposed by Mason et al. (35), germline mutations in the
genes encoding the telomerase complex cause progressive
telomere shortening, resulting in the senescence and
perhaps death of stem cells (Figure 3). An increased
number of quiescent cells with replicative potential must
then be recruited into the cell cycle. These new stem cells
proliferate and undergo further telomere shortening,
followed by senescence. The premature exhaustion of the
pool of stem cells leads to clinical disease. If mutations in
cell cycle checkpoint genes such as p53 have occurred,
cells with very short telomeres can continue to divide until
their telomeres become more dysfunctional and lose their
ability to protect the ends of chromosomes. These can
then initiate breakage-fusion-bridge cycles and generate
genomic instability, which in turn can lead to cancer.
In contrast to the bone marrow, the adult lung has a much
slower turnover of cells. The diﬀerent regions of the lung
house diﬀerent stem cell populations that contribute
to repair and maintenance (92). The observations of
TERT mutations and shortened telomere lengths in
patients with IPF suggest that the lung is among the
tissues that are dependent upon renewal by telomerase-
expressing stem cells, with disruption of this process
leading to ﬁbrosis. Similarly, in diﬀerent rodent models of
pulmonary ﬁbrosis, injury of the lung epithelial cells leads
to increased expression of telomerase suggesting its
protective role in this disease process (93,94).
Several correlative studies lend support to the idea
that individuals with shorter than age-matched control
telomeres are prone to disease. For example, patients with
atherosclerotic heart disease have signiﬁcantly shorter
telomeres compared to healthy aged-matched controls
(95–97). Independent of age and mean arterial pressure,
arterial stiﬀness and pulse pressure are inversely correlated
with TRF length in men (95). In a retrospective study of
archival cryopreserved blood cells, telomere length was a
major independent predictor for overall mortality.
Patients (60–97 years of age) with the shortest quartile
of blood telomeres had an 8-fold higher mortality due to
infectious disease compared to those in the other quartiles
(98). Shorter telomere lengths have also been associated
with reduced bone mineral density and osteoporosis (99),
obesity (100) and cigarette smoking (91,100). Whether
mutations in TERT or TERC or the genes that encode
telomerase-associated proteins underlie these more
common age-related diseases remains to be seen.
Can we slow down the progressive telomeres shortening
in DKC, bone marrow failure or IPF?
There is now strong circumstantial evidence that inherited
defects in the telomerase pathway cause some cases of
DKC, bone marrow failure and IPF. Collectively, these
studies lend support to the hypothesis that short telomeres
caused by various insults (increases in cell turnover
associated with chronic age-associated diseases, inﬂam-
matory processes, oxidative damage, genetic alterations in
telomerase components) correlate with disease. Showing
cause and eﬀect will require demonstrating that slowing
down the rate of telomere loss or resetting the telomere
clock reverses or delays the onset of disease. Are DKC,
bone marrow failure and IPF the appropriate diseases to
test the therapeutic value of telomere rejuvenation?
We have expressed TERT to immortalize a variety of
human cell types including skin keratinocytes, dermal
ﬁbroblasts, muscle satellite (stem) cells, endothelial cells,
retinal-pigmented epithelial cells, breast epithelial cells,
and both corneal ﬁbroblasts (keratocytes) and corneal
epithelial cells. Human corneal and skin cells expressing
TERT can be used to form organotypic cultures.
Such bioengineered tissues express diﬀerentiation-speciﬁc
proteins, suggesting that TERT does not inhibit
the normal diﬀerentiation of cells. TERT-immortalized
myoblasts form apparently normal muscle in vivo follow-
ing injection into immunoincompetent mice (101).
Even the overexpression of TERT, cdk4 and mutant
Ras does not prevent the diﬀerentiation of normal skin
keratinocytes in organotypic culture (unpublished data).
The production of engineered cells and tissues thus oﬀers
Figure 3. A proposed model underlying the pathogenesis of inherited
human diseases of telomere dysfunction. Inherited genetic eﬀects and
certain environmental eﬀects can aﬀect telomere lengths. With each
round of cell division telomeres shorten until a critical telomere length
is reached. Additional quiescent cells with replicative potential are then
recruited into the cell cycle. These new stem cells proliferate and
undergo further telomere shortening, followed by senescence. The
premature exhaustion of the pool of stem cells leads to the clinical
diseases of pulmonary ﬁbrosis, bone marrow failure and failure of other
organs associated with dyskeratosis congenita. If mutations in cell cycle
checkpoint genes such as p53 have occurred, the senescent growth
arrest is blocked, cells divide and telomeres continue to shorten until
they lose their ability to protect the ends of chromosomes. These can
initiate breakage-fusion-bridge cycles and generate genomic instability,
which can lead to cancer.

diseases that are due to telomere-based replicative
senescence.
TREATMENT OPTIONS
We propose that there are likely to be many diﬀerent
diseases in which replicative aging due to excess telomere
shortening contributes to tissue-speciﬁc or cell-speciﬁc
disease. For these pathologic processes, rejuvenating
cells by increasing telomere lengths may be beneﬁcial.
We already have the ability to express telomerase, leaving
cells with long telomeres and a greatly extended lifespan.
Advances in gene therapy, particularly the development of
‘fail-safe’ constructs that encode inducible cell-suicide
products, will reduce the risk of cancerous transformation
associated with telomerase expression for therapeutic
purposes. To test if telomere rejuvenation could impact
on the progression of disease such as bone marrow
failure, one approach would be to isolate hematopoietic
stem cells from patients with short telomeres, expand the
cells in the laboratory, transfect them with adenoviral
hTERT (that does not integrate into nuclear DNA),
characterize telomere lengths of the cells in vitro and
return the rejuvenated stem cells to the patient. The
obvious advantages of this approach over allogenic
bone marrow transplants are that using the patient’s
own cells would avoid problems of rejection and there
would be no need for bone marrow ablation. Clearly,
safety and eﬃcacy standards, as well as quality and
control assurances will need to be carefully considered
prior to initiating these studies. Several reports have
suggested that small molecule activators of telomerase can
extend the lifespan of lymphocytes, and such molecules
might potentially work with hematopoietic stem cells
as well (102).
Treatment of pulmonary ﬁbrosis may present an
especially diﬃcult clinical challenge because ﬁbrosis of
the lung parenchyma is generally considered an end-stage
manifestation of an irreversible pathologic process. For
this reason, eﬀective treatment of pulmonary ﬁbrosis due
to telomerase insuﬃciency may require early recognition
of preclinical disease, modiﬁcation of environmental
exposures and strategies for early intervention with
telomerase activation. Since oxidative damage has been
shown to shorten telomeres in tissue culture models
(13,14), systemic administration of antioxidants may be
beneﬁcial at preserving telomere lengths and delaying the
onset of disease in susceptible individuals. Strategies
towards activation of telomerase should be targeted to
cells of replicative potential in the lung, ideally before the
onset of disease. The goal would be to maintain a balance
of enough telomerase activity to lengthen critically short
telomeres without allowing pre-malignant lesions to
progress. Since this may be diﬃcult, the most promising
approach may involve gene therapy including several
conditional replication-dependent suicide genes. Under
these conditions, any tumors that develop could have
built-in therapeutic targets for their control.
CONCLUSIONS
The identiﬁcation of mutations in multiple components
of the telomerase complex in IPF, DKC and sporadic
bone marrow failure patients underscores the importance
of telomerase in the pathogenesis of these disorders.
These mutations may decrease the stability of the
telomerase complex, reduce the recruitment or activation
of telomerase at the telomere itself, or directly aﬀect the
enzymatic activity of telomerase. An insuﬃcient level of
telomerase results in progressive telomere shortening,
most notably in tissues that require continuous renewal.
Progress has been slow in DKC since it is such a rare
disease. However, the discovery that other more common
diseases, such as bone marrow failure syndromes and IPF,
are also associated with telomerase mutations and
telomere shortening opens up more opportunities so that
we may learn a great deal about the mechanisms and
consequences of telomere maintenance in humans.
