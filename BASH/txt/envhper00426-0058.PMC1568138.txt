Prevention of Benzene-Induced
Myelotoxicity by Nonsteroidal
Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
by George F. Kalf,* Michael J. Schlosser,* John F. Renz,*
and Suzanne J. Pirozzi*
Benzene affects hematopoietic progenitor cells leading to bone marrow depression and genotoxic effects
such as micronucleus fonnation. Progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation are inhibited by prostaglan-
dins produced by macrophages. Administration ofbenzene to DBA/2 or C57BL/6 mice caused a dose-dependent
bone marrow depression and a significant increase in marrow prostaglandin E level and both were prevented
by the coadministration of indomethacin and other inhibitors ofthe cyclooxygenase component of prosta-
glandin H synthase. Levels ofbenzene that decreased bone marrow cellularity also caused genotoxic effects
measured as increased micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in peripheral blood, which was also
prevented by the coadministration of indomethacin. These results suggest a possible role for prostaglandin
synthase in benzene myelotoxicity; a mechanism by which this might occur is presented.
Introduction
Chronic exposure of humans and experimental animals
to benzene results in bone marrow depression, which can
lead to pancytopenia and aplastic anemia (1). Benzene ex-
posure also results in genotoxic effects such as structural
chromosome aberrations (2) and single-strand breaks that
produce a prolonged accumulation of micronuclei in ma-
ture erythrocytes ofthe peripheral blood in rodents (3-9).
Benzene is also associated with an increased incidence of
acute myelogenous leukemia and some of its variant
forms in humans and several types of solid tumors and
leukemia and lymphomas in rats and mice (10).
Benzene metabolism, which is required for toxicity, oc-
curs predominantly in the liver where phenol, the major
metabolite, is converted to the secondary metabolites
hydroquinone and catechol (11,12). Phenol, transported
from the liver to the bone marrow, is metabolized by a
peroxidase-mediated pathway as is its oxidation product,
hydroquinone (13,14), which can be converted to p-
benzoquinone via the benzosemiquinone radical (15).
In bone marrow, benzene appears to have a cytotoxic
effect on hematopoietic progenitor cells in intermediate

stages ofdifferentiation regardless ofcell lineage (16,17),
but there is also evidence to indicate that injury to mar-
row stromal cells may be an important factor in benzene-
induced myelosuppression (18,19). These effects may be
related since hematopoiesis results from stem and pro-
genitor cells interacting with the supporting marrow
stroma. Stromal cells provide essential growth factors
[colony-stimulating factors (CSFs)] (20) and a favorable
microenvironment for the survivial and the regulated
proliferation and differentiation of stem and progenitor
cells (21).
Macrophages in bone marrow stroma have been sug-
gested to be an important regulator ofhematopoiesis (22).
Hematopoiesis is enhanced when the macrophage
releases the monokine IL-1 (23), which induces stromal
cells to produce CSFs (24,25), progenitor cell growth fac-
tors. Downregulation ofhematopoiesis occurs when CSFs
induce macrophages (26-28) and fibroblasts (29) to pro-
duce prostaglandins. Prostaglandin E2 blocks the ability
of myeloid progenitor cells to respond to CSFs (30) and
inhibits the production of IL-1 in the macrophage (31).
The macrophage can thereby regulate hematopoiesis by
producing CSFs to enhance hematopoietic proliferation
and downregulate it by increasing the concentration of
prostaglandins. Consequently, an effect ofbenzene or its
metabolites on stromal macrophages could secondarily af-
fect the survival, proliferation, and differentiation ofpro-
genitor cells (21).
KALF ET AL.
Garnett et al. (32) reported that the development ofan
adherent stromal layer in culture from marrow cells of
benzene-treated animals was morphologically altered,
and its ability to support the differentiation of stem cells
seeded upon it was decreased, thus demonstrating an in
vivo effect ofbenzene on stromal cells. Exposure ofbone
marrow stromal cells in vitro to phenol, hydroquinone,
or catechol causes similar effects on the stromal cells (33).
Gaido and Wierda (19) reported that hydroquinone in-
creased production of PGE2 in marrow stromal cell cul-
tures to a level that significantly inhibited stromal cell-
supported granulocyte/macrophage (G/M) colony forma-
tion. Pretreatment ofthe cultures with the nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indomethacin, an inhib-
itor of the cyclooxygenase component of prostaglandin
synthase, decreased PGE2 levels and protected against
hydroquinone toxicity (19,34).
These important results suggest a possible role for
prostaglandin synthase in benzene-induced myelo- and
genotoxicity. Since prostaglandins are inhibitors of
hematopoiesis, the stimuation of their formation by ben-
zene could cause an inhibition of stromal cell-supported
hematopoiesis. Also, the endoperoxidase component of
prostaglandin synthase could oxidize phenol and/or
hydroquinone to reactive metabolites. For example,
hydroquinone could be metabolized to p-benzoquinone,
which induces single-strand breaks in DNA (35) and
micronucleus formation in polychromatic erythrocytes
(36). We report here that the depression ofbone marrow
cellularity and the increase in frequency of micro-
nucleated polychromatic erythrocytes induced in mice by
benzene can be prevented by the coadministration of
NSAID.
Materials and Methods
Materials
Animals. Swiss-Webster wild-type male mice were ob-
tained from Ace Breeders (Boyertown, PA); DBA/2 and
C57BL/6 inbred male mice were purchased from Jackson
Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The animals weighed be-
tween 15 and 25 g when used. Animals were housed in
an AAALAC-approved central animal facility and fed Pu-
rina Rodent Chow ad libitum.
Reagents. Benzene (spectroanalyzed and thiophene-
free) was purchased from Fisher Scientific Company
(Pittsburgh, PA). Indomethacin, fluorescein diacetate,
ethidium bromide, N-2-Hydroxyethylpiperazine-
N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), dextran (70,000 m.w.),
activated charcoal (250-350 mesh), and bovine serum al-
bumin (BSA) were obtained from the Sigma Chemical
Company (St. Louis, MO). Roswell Park Memorial Insti-
tute (RPMI) 1640 medium and trypan blue dye were pur-
chased from Hazelton Dutchland (Denver, PA).
Meclofenamate was a gift from John Flynn of Thomas
Jefferson University. Heparin was obtained from the
Nutritional Biochemical Corporation (Cleveland, OH) and
aspirin was purchased from Merck and Company (Rah-
way, NJ). NEN/Dupont (Boston, MA) was the source of
Aquasol-2 and [3H]PGE2 (170 Ci/mmole). PGE2 was ob-
tained from CalBiochem/Behring (San Diego, CA), and
PGE2 antiserum was from Advanced Magnetics, Inc.
(Cambridge, MA). Colchicine was a gift from James Koc-
sis of Thomas Jefferson University. All chemicals were
of the highest grade available.
Methods
Handling ofBenzene. The laboratory practices recom-
mended by the NIH Guidelines for the Laboratory Use
of Chemical Carcinogens were followed. During the
period when the animals were expiring benzene, they
were housed in a carcinogen-rated hood under conditions
approved by the Institutional Animal Research Com-
mittee.
Treatment ofAnimals with Chemicals. Benzene in
corn oil (12 mL/kg body weight) was administered IP at
doses of 0, 400, 800, or 1200 mg/kg twice daily for 2 days.
Daily injections of animals were separated by 7 hr. The
animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation on day 3
and one femur per animal was used. Indomethacin was
prepared as a fresh stock solution (2 mg/mL in 95%
ethanol) and diluted with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered
saline without calcium or magnesium, pH 7.3 (PBS A), to
a final concentration of 0.08 or 0.17 mg/mL. Aspirin (4.15
mg/mL) was prepared in 50 mM sodium bicarbonate prior
to each injection and a solution ofmeclofenamate (0.48 or
0.96 mg/mL) was prepared daily in water. In the experi-
ments with prostaglandin synthase inhibitors, benzene
was administered at 400 mg/kg body weight and the in-
hibitors were coadministered at doses described. Control
animals received corn oil and/or a 4.2% solution of etha-
nolic PBS A.
Determination of Bone Marrow Cellularity. The
epiphysial plate on each end of the femur was removed.
Three milliliters ofa solution ofcold RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10 U/mL heparin and 10 mM
HEPES, pH 7.3, was forced through the femur using a
syringe with a 25-gauge needle. The bone marrow cells
were flushed into a tissue culture tube and collected by
centrifugation at 10OOg at 40C for 5 min. Red blood cells
were used by suspending the marrow cells in 1 mL of a
cold solution consisting of 155 mM NH4Cl, 0.1 mM
EDTA, and 10 mM KHCO3. The nucleated cells were col-
lected by centrifugation, and the pellet was dispersed into
a single cell suspension in 5 mL of RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, that was
placed on ice for 2 min to allow red cell membranes to
sediment. The nucleated cells were collected by centrifu-
gation, suspended in RPMI 1640-HEPES, counted with
the use of a hemocytometer, and tested for viability us-
ing both the trypan blue dye and fluorescein diace-
tate/ethidium bromide methods (3?).
Determination ofMicronuclei. Immediately after sac-
rifice, a blood sample was obtained and a smear made to
evaluate clastogenicity from benzene in the form of in-
creased frequency ofmicronucleus formation in polychro-
matic erythrocytes (PCE) ofperipheral blood. In general,
the assay was carried out under the guidelines published
58
PREVENTION OF BENZENE-INDUCED TOXICITY WITH PROSTAGLANDIN SYNTHASE INHIBITORS
for the conduct ofmicronucleus assays (38). The blood was
smeared on the slide in a thin uniform layer that allowed
for the visualization of individual cells. Blood cells were
fixed in 100% methanol for 15 min and allowed to dry
overnight. The smears were stained for 6 min in a solu-
tion ofacridine orange (0.125 mg/mL) in phospate buffer,
pH 7.4 (39), after which they were washed in phosphate
buffer for an additional 7 min. Fluorescent microscopy
was used to distinguish normochromatic erthrocytes
(NCE) from PCE. In each animal, the frequency of
micronucleated cells was determined among 2000 NCE
and 500 PCE; concomitantly the number of PCE/2000
NCE was also evaluated. The slides were randomly
coded. Structures refractile when in focus were not
scored.
Effect ofBenzene on PGE2 Levels. DBA/2 mice were
injected with benzene (800 mg/kg in corn oil) in the pres-
ence or absence of indomethacin (8 mg/kg). Control
animals received equal volumes of vehicles. The animals
were killed 6 to 7 hr after benzene administration, both
femurs were dissected out, and the epiphysial plate on
each end was removed. Each femur was flushed with 0.1
ml ofice-cold 10 mM phospate buffer, pH 7.0, containing
150 mM NaCl, 0.1% BSA and 20 ,ug/mL meclofenamate
(RIA buffer). Cells were combined, suspended, and col-
lected by centrifugation at 500g for 10 min at 40C. Mar-
row cells were suspended in 1 mL of cold lysing solution,
centrifuged, and washed three times with 1 mL PBS A.
The protein content ofthe nucleated cells was determined
by the method of Bradford (40) using bovine serum albu-
min as a standard.
Determination ofPGE. The marrow supernatant was
analyzed for total PGE by radioimmunoassay according
to the procedure supplied by Advanced Magnetics (Cam-
bridge, MA). Incubations contained 0.1 mL of PGE2 an-
tiserum (1:5000), [3H]PGE2 (38000 dpm), and PGE2 (0.04
to 15 ng or an amount of marrow supernatant) to a final
volume of 0.3 mL. Cross-reactivity of the PGE2 antise-
rum was 100% with PGEI; 6.0% with PGA2; and 3.0%
with PGA,. Radioactivity bound to the antibody was de-
termined in a 0.5 mL sample added to 5.0 mL of
Aquasol-2. Radioactivity was counted in an intertech-
nique SL 30 scintillation counter.
Preparation ofMacrophages. Peritoneal macrophages
were elicited from male C57BL/6 mice 5 days following
protease peptone (IP). Macrophages were purified by ac-
tive adherence to plastic Petri dishes. Over 95% ofadher-
ent cells are macrophages as assessed by morphology,
nonspecific esterase-positive staining, and phagocytosis
of sheep red blood cells.
Statistical Analyses. One-way ANOVA (41) followed
by Dunnett's t-test (42) was used to analyze bone marrow
cellularity and PGE levels. The PCE/NCE were analyzed
by one-way ANOVA (41), and if the ratios were not sig-
nificantly different a one-way ANOVA of the
micronuclei/PCE was carried out. Ifthis proved to be sig-
nificant, a Duncan's multiple range test was carried out
(43). Results are expressed as mean values + standard
deviation (SD). A value ofp c 0.05 was considered to be
significant.
Results
Depression of Bone Marrow Cellularity as
a Function of Benzene Dose
The dose ofbenzene that gave sufficient depression of
the bone marrow cellularity without killing the animals
was previously determined (44). The degree ofbone mar-
row depression was a function of benzene dose in both
DBA/2 and C57BL/6 strains ofmice over a concentration
range of 200 to 1200 mg/kg body weight. A dose of 400
mg/kg body weight caused a statistically significant (p c
0.005) decrease in marrow cellularity in both strains of
mice with no loss of animals and with greater than 95%
viability of the cells flushed from the femur. This dose of
benzene was generally used in most subsequent experi-
ments.
Prevention of Benzene-Induced Bone
Marrow Depression by NSAID
Treatment of DBA/2 mice with benzene twice daily for
2 days caused a significant decrease in bone marrow cel-
lularity when measured on day 3 (Table 1). Coadministra-
tion ofindomethacin (2 mg/kg body weight) with benzene
completely prevented the marrow depression. This ex-
periment was repeated five times with the same results.
Similar results were obtained using C57BL/6 mice (data
not shown). The ability of indomethacin to prevent the
benzene-induced bone marrow depression was dose
related and indomethacin per se had no affect on bone
marrow cellularity (Table 1).
Meclofenamate and aspirin, which inhibit the cycloox-
ygenase activity ofprostaglandin H synthase by mecha-
nisms different from that of indomethacin, were tested
for their ability to prevent benzene toxicity. These
results, which are presented in Table 1, indicate that
meclofenamate (4 mg/kg) or aspirin (50 mg/kg) signifi-
cantly prevented benzene-induced bone marrow depres-
sion. The agents by themselves had no effect on bone
marrow cellularity.
Effect of Benzene on PGE Levels in Bone
Marrow
Total PGE in the bone marrow of animals treated with
benzene was significantly higher than that present in the
marrow of animals receiving only the vehicle when PGE
was expressed per femur or per milligram cellular pro-
tein (Table 2). Coadministration of indomethacin with
benzene not only prevented the increase in PGE due to
benzene, but also significantly lowered the amount of
PGE normally produced in marrow (Table 2).
Benzene-Induced Micronucleus Formation
Under conditions where benzene causes significant my-
elotoxicity in the form of decreased bone marrow cellular-
ity (Table 1), it also causes genotoxicity measured as an
increase in the frequency of micronucleus formation in
PCE. It can be seen in Table 3 that benzene administered
to Swiss-Webster mice at 400 mg/kg body weight caused

a 3.8-fold increase in the frequency of micronucleus for-
mation in PCE under conditions where the same dose
caused approximately a 40% decrease in bone marrow
cellularity (Table 1). The number ofmicronuclei observed
in the control group agrees with the spontaneous fre-
quency of micronucleus formation in PCEs reported for
mice (45). Colchicine, an alkaloid known to cause
micronuclei by interfering with spindle formation and
thus with nuclear division in bone marrow erythroblasts,
was used as a positive control (approximately 15
micronuclei/1000 PCE). A change in the frequency of
micronuclei in NCE was not observed and would not be
expected since the frequency of micronucleated cells
among NCE does not increase as markedly as that among
PCEs after an acute exposure (38). The lack ofan increase
in micronuclei in NCE also serves as a quality control
since any artifacts in a given smear will produce appar-
ent increases in the frequencies of micronuclei in both
NCE and PCE (38).

Prevention of Benzene-Induced
Genotoxicity by Indomethacin
We carried out experiments to ascertain whether
NSAID could also prevent the genotoxic effects of ben-
zene. As can be seen for the data presented in Table 3,
coadministration of indomethacin with benzene com-
pletely prevented the increase in the frequency of
micronucleated PCE without affecting the division or
maturation of nucleated erythroid cells as indicated by
the PCE/NCE. The administration of indomethacin alone
had no effect on the frequency ofmicronucleus formation.
This experiment was repeated six times with essentially
the same result.
Arachidonic Acid-Dependent Activation of
Phenol by Macrophages
The inhibition ofthe genotoxic effects ofbenzene by in-
domethacin suggested that metabolites of benzene such
as phenol and/or hydroquinone might be converted to
clastogenic compounds by prostaglandin synthase en-
doperoxidase. Consequently, we tested the ability ofmac-
rophages to effect the arachidonic acid-dependent metab-
olism of phenol to reactive species that bind to
macromolecules. Purified peritoneal macrophages were
incubated with [14C] phenol in the presence and absence
of arachidonic acid. As can be seen in Figure 1, macro-
phages metabolize phenol to reactive compounds that ir-
reversibly bind to macromolecules in a reaction that is de-
pendent on the concentration of arachidonic acid in the
incubation. These results suggest that prostaglandin syn-

thase endoperoxidase in macrophages might be respon-
sible for the cooxidation of phenol and/or hydroquinone
to reactive species during the benzene-induced formation
of prostaglandins. Purified prostaglandin H synthase has
been shown to oxidize both phenol and hydroquinone to
species that bind irreversibly to protein and DNA (46).
Discussion
Benzene caused a dose-dependent depression of bone
marrow cellularity in both DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice,
which was prevented by the coadministration of in-
domethacin, aspirin or meclofenamate (Table 1). In-
domethacin protects against benzene-induced bone mar-
row depression at a dose (2 mg/kg, 2 times/day for 2 days)
that has no effect on body weight or bone marrow cel-
lularity. Benzene also causes genotoxicity as measured
by an increase in the frequency of micronucleus forma-
ton in polychromatic erythrocytes, which also can be
prevented by indomethacin (Table 3).

row depression and increased the frequency of

micronucleated PCE, liver microsomes from
indomethacin-treated animals showed no alteration in
cytochromes P-450 level (nmole/mg microsomal protein)
or activity as measured by either the conversion of ben-
zene to phenol or the N-demethylation of aminopyrine
(data not presented). This indicates that indomethacin
does not interfere with the initial metabolism ofbenzene
to phenol in the liver.
Benzene increased the level of PGE (Table 2) and un-
doubtedly that of other prostaglandins (PGE2) in bone
marrow and depressed bone marrow cellularity. Coad-
ministration of indomethacin prevented the benzene-
induced rise in PGE level (Table 2).
The ability of inhibitors of prostaglandin synthase to
prevent the increase in PGE level in bone marrow and
concomitantly prevent both benzene-induced bone mar-
row cell depression and micronucleus formation suggests
that prostaglandin synthase may play a role in the ex-
pression of benzene-induced toxicity; a possible mecha-
nism is presented in Figure 2. Benzene is metabolized in
the liver and bone marrow to phenol and hydroquinone.
Benzene per se may act on bone marrow cells to effect the
constitutive release of arachidonic acid from membrane
phospholipids.
Rhogani et al. (47) have recently demonstrated that
benzene, albeit at rather high concentrations, can activate
purified protein kinase C from brain and also the enzyme
in platelets. Activators of kinase C (i.e., phorbol esters)
are known to enhance the release ofarachidonic acid from
phospholipids in platelets (48) and macrophages (49). Al-
ternatively, a highly reactive metabolite such as p-
benzoquinone might interact with and damage membrane
components, causing a turnover ofphospholipids and the
release of arachidonic acid (50). In either case, released
arachidonic acid would be converted by the cycloox-
ygenase component of prostaglandin synthase to the
hydroperoxide (PGG2). The hydroperoxide in turn would
drive the endoperoxidase activity of the enzyme. The
cooxidation ofhydroquinone or phenol during endoperox-
idase conversion of PGG2 to PGH2, the immediate precur-
sor molecule for prostaglandins, would result in increased
levels of prostaglandins. In the case of hydroquinone,

cooxidation would generate p-benzoquinone, which has
been shown to cause single-strand breaks in DNA (35),
to inhibit DNA replication (51,52) and to interact with the
sulihydryl groups of the microtubule protein, tubulin, re-
quired for spindle formation and cell division (15). Each
ofthese insults has been shown to cause micronucleus for-
mation. In summary, the inability of remaining viable
stem and/or progenitor cells to proliferate due to the con-
stitutive production of high levels of prostaglandins,
known to be negative regulators of hematopoiesis, cou-
pled with genotoxic damage from reactive metabolites
such as p-benzoquinone might explain the benzene-
induced myelotoxicity.
We believe that the major peroxidase operating, espe-
cially in the macrophage, is the endoperoxidase activity
ofprostaglandin synthase. The level ofindomethacin used
in these experiments (2 mg/kg body weight, IP) should
provide a blood level, even if all ofthe dose accumulated
in the blood, low enough that indomethacin is a specific
inhibitor ofcyclooxygenase. However, since bone marrow
also contains considerable myeloperoxidase, especially in
the neutrophil, it is possible that myeloperoxidase is in-
volved in the metabolism ofphenol and hydroquinone to
reactive toxic species. Indeed, Smith has reported dur-
ing this symposium that myeloperoxidase is capable of
converting phenol and hydroquinone to reactive metabo-
lites and that indomethacin at rather high concentrations
inhibits the reaction in neutrophils and purified mye-
loperoxidase as well (53). We have demonstrated (5) that
the arachidonic acid-dependent cooxidation of hydroqui-
none to p-benzoquinone by purified sheep PHS-
peroxidase is completely prevented by inhibiting the cy-
clooxygenase component with 10 liM indomethacin,
whereas the H202-dependent conversion ofhydroquinone
to p-benzoquinone by human MPG or PHS-peroxidase is
unaffected. Furthermore, Uetrecht et al. (55) demon-
strated the oxidation of procainamide to reactive metabo-
lites in activated PMNs by a H202-dependent, azide-
sensitive reaction was attributed to MPG. Neither aspi-
rin nor indomethacin at 1 .iAM concentration prevented
this oxidation.
