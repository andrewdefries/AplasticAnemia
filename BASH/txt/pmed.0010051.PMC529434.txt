PRESENTATION of CASE
A
38-y-old woman with Down syn-
drome was admitted to hospital for
investigation of a 6-mo history of
anorexia and weight loss of 40 lbs. Six
months prior to admission, her weight was
175 lbs, and her body mass index was 36. On
admission, her complete blood count was
normal, but over a 2-wk period she devel-
oped acute pancytopenia (Figure 1). During
this acute episode, her lowest hematological
parameters were as follows: hemoglobin
(Hb), 80 g/l (normal range 120–160 g/l);
mean cell volume (MCV), 121 fl (80–95 fl);
white blood cell count (WBC), 2.9 3 106
/l
(4.8–10.8 3 106
/l); absolute neutrophil count,
1.1 3 106
/l (1.5–6.2 3 106
/l); and platelet
count, 76 3 106
/l (150–350 3 106
/l).
She had been taking carbamazepine for 17
y and sodium valproate for 13 y for a mixed
seizure disorder. At age 22 y, before starting
any anticonvulsants, her baseline hemato-
logical parameters were as follows: Hb,123 g/
l; MCV, 106 fl; platelets, 296 3106
/l; and WBC,
10.7 3 106
/l. After starting carbamazepine,
her WBC dropped to 4.5–5.5 3 106
/l, and her
absolute neutrophil count dropped from 9 3
106
/l to about 2.5 3 106
/l. When the sodium
valproate was added, her MCV increased to
112 fl, her platelet count fell to 100–150 3
106
/l, and her Hb dropped to 110–120 g/l.
The patient’s other medications on admis-
sion were carnitine and low-dose L-thyroxine
for hypothyroidism; she had been taking
both for several years. She had not been
recently exposed to any new medications,
environmental toxins, or over-the-counter
dietary supplements. There was no family
history of aplastic anemia. The patient lived
at home with her mother, who cares for her
and has legal guardianship.
A bone marrow biopsy (Figure 2) showed a
hypocellular bone marrow with a normal
myeloid:erythroid ratio and no malignant
cells or megaloblastic changes. Cytogenetic
study showed a Robertsonian (i.e., of the
whole arms) translocation of Chromosome
14 and 21 involving the long arm of
Chromosome 21. Except for mild adrenal
insufficiency noted on an adrenocortico-
tropic hormone stimulation test, all her tests,
including viral and immunological investiga-
tions to identify known causes of aplastic
anemia, were negative. The patient’s thyroid
function tests were normal. She was started
on low-dose hydrocortisone for her adrenal
insufficiency and megestrol acetate to in-
crease her appetite.
The patient’s carbamazepine was discon-
tinued. Within 10 d, her WBC had risen to 6.7
3 106
/l and her platelet count to 248 3 106
/l.
Serial complete blood counts showed wor-
sening anemia over the next 15 wk, requiring
two packed red blood cell transfusions at
week 6 and week 14, when her Hb was 31
and 53 g/l, respectively. Throughout this
period, her reticulocyte count was low, at
about 0.18% (normal range 0.5%–2%), while
her WBC and platelet count were normal. We
made a diagnosis of pure red cell aplasia
(PRCA). A second bone marrow biopsy under
minimally conscious sedation was unsuccess-
ful, and the patient declined further at-
tempts. After the first transfusion she was
started on prednisone and erythropoietin for
her PRCA. Meanwhile, because of her wor-
sening seizures, we increased her sodium
valproate dose, increasing her serum val-
proate level from 70 mcg/ml to 110 mcg/ml.
After the second transfusion, we discontin-
ued her sodium valproate and started her on
clonazepam and oxcarbazepine as alternative
anticonvulsants.
The patient had a brisk reticulocyte re-
sponse. Her reticulocyte count rose from
0.36% to 0.78% in the second week and to
6.61% in the fourth week after stopping the
valproate. Six weeks after stopping the drug,
her Hb was 125 g/l and her MCV was 106 fl,

suggesting replacement of transfused red blood cells with
newly formed red blood cells (which have a higher MCV than
older transfused cells). Over the next 30 mo of follow-up, she
had no relapse of her aplastic anemia.
We were unable to identify a specific cause for the
patient’s anorexia and weight loss. We found no evidence of
malignancy on admission or subsequent follow-up. Within 1
wk of stopping her sodium valproate, her appetite improved
and she put on 15 lbs over the next 6 wk. By the fourth
month after stopping the drug, she had gained 45 lbs.
We last saw the patient in August 2004. Her seizure control
had worsened, and she had developed signs of early
dementia. Her current anticonvulsants are clonazepam,
oxcarbazepine, and zonisamide, and she continues taking
synthroid. Her last complete blood count was stable: WBC,
6.4 3 106
/l; Hb, 147 g/l; MCV, 104.9 fl; and platelets, 262 3
106
/l.
Discussion
Sodium valproate and carbamazepine are associated with
rare but potentially lethal hematological complications.
There are ﬁve case reports of PRCA shortly after initiation
of sodium valproate, with the longest interval between the
initiation of therapy and the onset of aplasia being 2 y
[1,2,3,4,5]. Acute bone marrow suppression with leucopenia
and thrombocytopenia associated with carbamazepine most
often occur within 4 mo of starting treatment [6,7]. As far as
we know, our case report is unique in that the patient
developed acute bone marrow suppression and PRCA after
17 y of carbamazepine and 13 y of sodium valproate therapy.
Our investigations ruled out most of the known causes of
acute bone marrow suppression, making the anticonvulsants
the most likely cause. Malnutrition was an unlikely cause: her
WBC and platelet counts had recovered before any increase
in appetite or weight gain; her body mass index was normal
despite her weight loss; and her bone marrow iron stores were
adequate and her serum folate and vitamin B12 levels were
high, suggesting adequate nutrient supply.
We considered and rejected the possibility of Down
syndrome–associated aplastic anemia. There have been six
case reports of this condition, and in all cases it occurred in
young children, suggesting a genetic predisposition [8]. Half
of these patients died, and half responded partially to
Figure 1. Patient’s Clinical Course, Complete Blood Count, and Reticulocyte Count
The x-axis shows speciﬁc dates. In 1985, prior to starting anticonvulsants, the only abnormality was an MCV of 106 ﬂ. On admission (a), in 2001,
the only abnormality was an increased MCV of 119 ﬂ. During the second week of admission (b), her WBC, then her platelet count, dropped to
their lowest levels, while her Hb showed a gradual decline. Bone marrow biopsy showed suppression of all marrow elements. After stopping
carbamazepine, there was a brisk recovery of her WBC and platelet counts. Six weeks later (c), in February 2002, her Hb had dropped to 31 g/l,
and she was given a transfusion of packed cells. Eight weeks later (d), in April 2002, despite erythropoietin and steroid therapy, her Hb dropped
to 53 g/l and she received another transfusion. At this time, the sodium valproate was stopped. The reticulocyte count had remained abnormally
low throughout this period (a–d), and it was only after stopping the valproate that the reticulocyte count and Hb started to rise. Her MCV
dropped after the ﬁrst transfusion and did not rise again until there was a brisk reticulocyte response. ANC, absolute neutrophil count; retic,

androgenic steroids. Our patient was an adult, and her bone
marrow had responded to the withdrawal of her anticonvul-
sants and not to the administration of androgenic steroid.
She had failed to respond to a 6-wk course of high-dose non-
androgenic steroid and erythropoietin. Furthermore, our
patient did not have a relapse of her aplastic anemia in 30 mo
of follow-up, suggesting a lack of genetic disposition.
The brisk return of her WBC and platelet counts upon
discontinuing carbamazepine, and her brisk reticulocytosis
upon discontinuing sodium valproate, were both consistent
with previous reports of hematological toxicity due to these
drugs [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. What was unusual in our case was the
extremely late onset of bone marrow suppression after
initiation of drug therapy. The persistent suppression of
erythropoietic elements for 15 wk after stopping the
carbamazepine was unlikely to be due to persistent residual
marrow suppression by carbamazepine, since carbamazepine-
induced PRCA responds quickly (within 1–2 wk) to stopping
the drug [6,9]. We believe that the continued use of sodium
valproate, after stopping the carbamazepine, caused the
persistent suppression of erythropoietic elements.
We found no cause for the patient’s anorexia and weight
loss, but her appetite returned and she gained weight after
stopping the sodium valproate. There is a known association
between this drug and anorexia [10].

Learning Points
 Acute hematological complications of anticonvulsant therapy
can still occur after many years of therapy, so continued
vigilance is warranted.
 Although sodium valproate is generally associated with
increased appetite and weight gain, it can also be associated
with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.
