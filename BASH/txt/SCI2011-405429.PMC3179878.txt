We previously described the large-scale production of RBCs from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of diverse sources. Our present
eﬀorts are focused to produce RBCs thanks to an unlimited source of stem cells. Human embryonic stem (ES) cells or induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPS) are the natural candidates. Even if the proof of RBCs production from these sources has been done,
their ampliﬁcation ability is to date not suﬃcient for a transfusion application. In this work, our protocol of RBC production
was applied to HSC isolated from fetal liver (FL) as an intermediate source between embryonic and adult stem cells. We studied
the erythroid potential of FL-derived CD34+ cells. In this in vitro model, maturation that is enucleation reaches a lower level
compared to adult sources as observed for embryonic or iP, but, interestingly, they (i) displayed a dramatic in vitro expansion
(100-fold more when compared to CB CD34+) and (ii) 100% cloning eﬃciency in hematopoietic progenitor assays after 3 days of
erythroid induction, as compared to 10–15% cloning eﬃciency for adult CD34+ cells. This work supports the idea that FL remains
a model of study and is not a candidate for ex vivo RBCS production for blood transfusion as a direct source of stem cells but could
be helpful to understand and enhance proliferation abilities for primitive cells such as ES cells or iPS.
1. Introduction
The cell therapy approach which consists of generating
cultured RBC (cRBC) in vitro after ampliﬁcation of stem
cells (SC) makes sense in a context of chronic diﬃculties
of obtaining blood supplies. More than blood supplies,
hematopoietic diﬀerentiation of human stem cells into
RBC has important therapeutic implications, including the
possibility to produce virus-free units or tailor-designed phe-
notypes for transfusion purposes. Our team has established
an experimental procedure to reproduce in vitro terminal
erythropoiesis from adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)
from diverse sources (peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow
(BM), and cord blood (CB)) [1, 2]. This protocol, using
appropriate cytokines and a speciﬁc microenvironment
(including stromal murine MS5 or Mesenchymal Stem Cells
(MSC)) in a serum-free medium, allows HSC prolifera-
tion and terminal diﬀerentiation in mature and functional
enucleated RBC containing adult haemoglobin [2]. Major
advances have allowed towards the in vitro production of
RBCs from diverse sources in a few years. Nevertheless, their
transfusional future will become a reality only if we are able
to produce functional transfusable RBCs at a large scale. This
will of course require not only the conception of appropriate
industrial tools, but also ﬁnding the best source of stem cells.
To date, the most accessible and proliferative source of HSC
in a quantitative aspect is cord blood (CB) [3].
However, this cell source is dependent on donations
and ex vivo production of RBC is restricted to a system
of production in batches, using the ﬁnite quantity of HSC
available in a CB unit. Such are its limits.
2 Stem Cells International
Consequently, our present eﬀorts are focused on estab-
lishing conditions to produce RBC using a permanent and
inexhaustible source of stem cells. Human embryonic stem
cells or recently discovered induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPS) [4, 5] are the natural candidates. As other teams, we
have shown the possibility to reconstitute in vitro eryth-
ropoiesis starting from very primitive stem cells [6–13], and
we were the ﬁrst to report the erythroid diﬀerentiation and
maturation of iPS lines (from fetal and adult ﬁbroblasts)
into mature enucleated RBC (4% to 10% compared to 52%
to 66% from human ES cell line (H1)), which synthesized
functional fetal hemoglobin [9].
The demonstration that primitive cells can be diﬀeren-
tiated in vitro to cells similar to their natural counterpart
was the ﬁrst step for a potential therapeutic application. But
there is still a major problem for a hypothetical application
in transfusion: their ampliﬁcation. Indeed, in our conditions,
1 ES or 1 iPS cell can generate 5000 or 1000 RBC, respectively,
[9] whereas 1 CD34+ from CB can give up to 2.5 × 105
RBCs
[2]. This crucial diﬃculty of ampliﬁcation of ES or iPS has
not yet been solved by any team.
Rollini et al. have demonstrated that fetal liver (FL)
could be an alternative source of HSC despite a limited
total cell number per tissue, due to their high proliferative
capacity [14]. Indeed, the site of erythropoiesis migrates
during development. It takes place ﬁrst in the yolk sac and
the para-aortic region. Erythropoiesis then migrates to the
fetal liver between the 8th and the 22nd week of gestation
to ﬁnally take place in the BM [15]. In the present work
we investigated the capacity of CD34+ cells isolated from
human FL, an ontogenic source intermediate between very
primitive cells (ES and iPS) and adult stem cells, to expand
and diﬀerentiate into erythroid lineage cells.
We cocultured FL-derived CD34+ cells over an in vitro
reconstituted bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. As
observed for hES or iPS, only a fraction of erythroid
cells reached terminal diﬀerentiation into mature RBC
(15%). These few RBCs contained nearly exclusively fetal
hemoglobin at the protein level. However, as compared to
adult HSC, we could observe a dramatic expansion of FL-
derived erythroid cells, 100-fold higher when compared to
CB CD34+.
FL is an alternative model that might be relevant to
understanding mechanisms both implied in ampliﬁcation
and diﬀerentiation of HSC in erythropoiesis and could be
used as a model for other diﬀerentiation pathways.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Fetal Liver. Fetal livers were surgically obtained from
6 aborted fetuses (after 12–14 weeks of amenorrhoea) after
informed consent of patients was given. All experiments and
procedures were in agreement with the guidelines from the
French Health ministry and the Agence de la Biom´edecine.
FL was dissociated within less than 4 hours after collection
and ﬂushed through a 70 μm ﬁlter and preserved in a
PBS/BSA 10% (v/v) (Sigma Aldrich, Lyon, France) solution
until CD34 cell immunomagnetic separation, which was
performed within a maximal 1 hour delay.
2.2. CD34 Cell Isolation. FL CD34+ cells were isolated
by immunomagnetic separation according to the manu-
facturer’s guidelines (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany). CD34+ purity was evaluated by ﬂow cytometry.
2.3. FL-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs). The CD34
negative fractions were used for MSC generation according
to the technique described by Doucet et al. [16]. Brieﬂy,
cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105
cells/cm2 and cul-
tured in alpha-MEM medium (Biological Industries, ATGC
Biotechnologies, Noisy le Grand, France) supplemented with
5% (v/v) platelet-enriched plasma lysate (PL) and 2 IU/mL
heparin (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Cultures
were fed every 3-4 days with fresh medium. At conﬂuence
cells were replated at 6 × 103
/cm2. The grown cells had
a ﬁbroblast-like morphology. After 2 passages, cells were
assessed for immunophenotyping, and their phenotype
corresponded to MSCs, that is, CD73+, CD105+, CD90+,
CD45−
.
2.4. Generation of Red Blood Cells Ex Vivo. CD34+ cells
were cultured in a three-step procedure in a serum-free
medium as previously described [2] with some modiﬁcations
such as the source of serum or the use of FL mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) as stroma. 2 × 104
CD34+ cells/mL were
ﬁrst cultured in IMDM medium (Biological Industries,
ATGC Biotechnologies) supplemented either with 1% BSA
or 1% human AB plasma, 10 μg/mL insulin (Sigma), and
120 μg/mL iron-saturated human transferrin (Sigma). In
the ﬁrst step (days 0–8), 2 × 104
/mL CD34+ cells were
cultured in the presence of 10−6 M hydrocortisone (Sigma),
100 ng/mL stem cell factor (SCF, Peprotech, Neuilly sur
Seine, France), 5 ng/mL IL-3 (R&D Systems), and 3 IU/mL
erythropoietin (Eprex, kindly provided by Janssen-Cilag).
On day 4, one volume of cell culture was diluted in four
volumes of fresh medium containing hydrocortisone, SCF,
IL-3, and erythropoietin. In the second step (days 8–10),
the cells were replated at 5 × 104
/mL and cocultured on
an adherent stromal layer in fresh medium supplemented
with erythropoietin. In the third step (days 10–18), cells
were cultured on an adherent stromal layer in fresh medium
without cytokines. The cultures were maintained at 37◦
C in
5% CO2. The adherent cell layer consisted of either the MS-5
stromal cell line (provided by K. Mori) or fetal mesenchymal
stromal cells (MSCs) established from the CD34 negative
fraction of FL liver samples.
2.5. Colony Assay. Colony-Forming Unit Granulocyte Ma-
crophage (CFU-GM), Colony-Forming Unit Erythroid cells
(CFU-E), Burst-Forming Unit Erythroid cells (BFU-E) and
Colony-Forming Unit Mix (CFU-Mix) were assayed in a
semisolid methylcellulose medium as previously described
[17].
2.6. Flow Cytometry Analyses. All immunophenotyping
analyses were performed using a FACScalibur ﬂow cytome-
ter (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) using
CellQuest Pro software. Immunophenotyping of fetal
Stem Cells International 3
MSCs was carried out with the following antibodies:
FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 (Beckman Coulter, Imunotech,
Roissy en France, France), anti-CD105 (Serotec, Cergy
Saint Christophe, France), PE-conjugated anti-CD90, and
anti-CD73 (Pharmingen-Becton Dickinson Franklin Lakes,
USA). Immunophenotyping of fetal RBCs was carried
out with the following antibodies: FITC-conjugated anti-
CD36 and PE-conjugated anti-CD71 (Beckman Coulter,
Imunotech). Immunophenotyping of fetal mononuclear
cells was carried out with the following antibodies: FITC-
conjugated anti-CD38 (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), anti-
Glycophorin A, anti-CD36, anti-CD71, anti-CD45, PE-
conjugated anti-CD117, anti-CD33, anti-CD34, anti-CD2,
anti-CD3, anti-CD8, (Beckman Coulter-Imunotech), anti-
CD19, anti-CD4, anti-CD14, and anti-CD56 (Becton Dick-
inson). Appropriate negative controls (mouse anti-human
irrelevant control) were performed for each FACS analysis.
2.7. Cells and Hemoglobin Characterisation
Hematological Staining. Cell diﬀerentiation was monitored
throughout culture by morphological analysis of the cells
after cytocentrifugation and May-Gr¨unwald-Giemsa (MGG)
staining.
Hemoglobin Analysis. The pattern of hemoglobin (Hb) syn-
thesis was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatog-
raphy (HPLC) (Biorad variant II, BioRad Laboratories,
Munich, Germany) with a high-resolution betathalassemia
program.
2.8. Semiquantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase-
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Using the protocol
of erythroid diﬀerentiation described above, we generated
RBCs from CD34+ cells isolated from diﬀerent ontogenic
sources (i.e., from CB, BM, and FL) in order to compare
the kinetics of the transcriptomic proﬁle of genes known
to be involved in erythroid diﬀerentiation (GATA-1, FOG
1, SOX6, GFI 1b, STAT5a, FOXO3a, and α, β, γ, ε, ζ globin
chains).
Total RNA was prepared from cells collected at diﬀerent
times of RBCs culture (days 8, 11, 15, 18). RNA was extracted
using the Trizol method according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland). 1 μg of DNase-
treated RNA was transcribed into cDNA using 200 units
of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and
150 ng of random primers (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA
was aliquoted to avoid repeat freeze/thaw cycles. Real-time
PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence
Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif,
USA). The 18S gene was used as an internal reference. All
primers and probes were from Applied Biosystems.
Other genes were ampliﬁed using SYBRgreen chemistry,
and the GAPDH gene was used as an internal reference. All
primers were from Eurogentech (Liege, Belgium).
For both chemistries, PCR were performed in duplicate
using either the TaqMan Master Mix or SYBR green Master
Mix with 10 ng of cDNA and 300 nM of primers in a ﬁnal

C, the
AmpliTaq Gold was activated by 10-minute incubation at
95◦
C. A total of 40 ampliﬁcation cycles were run with an
annealing temperature of 60◦
C. Calibration curves were
established to check that PCR eﬃciency was similar for
all target genes and references. The relative expression of
a given target gene was given by the 2−ΔΔCt method [18],
where ΔΔCt represents the diﬀerence of an unknown sample
(days 8, 11, 15, 18 of culture) versus a control (day 0 of
culture) for a target gene normalized to a control gene
(18S or GAPDH). This calculation method is suitable for
investigating physiological changes in gene expression levels.
3. Results
Starting from FL-derived CD34+ cells, we used a three-step
stimulation protocol. Firstly, cell proliferation and erythroid
diﬀerentiation were induced with stem cell factor (SCF),
interleukin-3 (IL3), and erythropoietin (Epo). Secondly,
the cells were cocultured with additional Epo alone on an
in vitro reconstituted BM microenvironment (human fetal
MSC or murine MS5 stromal cell line). In the third step,
all exogenous factors were withdrawn, and the cells were
incubated on the stroma alone.
3.1. Massive Expansion and Commitment of Human Erythroid
Cells from FL-Derived CD34+ Cells. In the starting FL
population, smear examination showed that a majority of
cells belonged to the erythroid lineage, more than 50% being
proerythroblasts. As analyzed by ﬂow cytometry, most cells
expressed markers of the erythroid lineage (69% double
positive for CD235a/CD36 and 74% for CD235a/CD71), and
22 ± 2.8% were CD34+/CD38−
HSC. Other cells belonged
to the myeloid lineage while no lymphoid B or T cells
were detected (Table 1). After CD34+ immunomagnetic
separation, we obtained a purity of over 90%. The three-
step protocol resulted in a dramatic ampliﬁcation of CD34+

(FL) were grown in liquid culture according to the three-step

n = 3) and BM (2.6 × 104
± 0.8 × 104
-fold, n = 3) cells,
respectively, (Figure 1).
The development of a large and almost pure erythroid
cell population can probably be attributed to the preferential
proliferation of the generated erythroid progenitors and
their subsequent diﬀerentiation and maturation. On day
3, 100% of the cells were clonogenic, most belonging to
the erythroid lineage (44% BFU-E, 7% CFU-E, 33% CFU-
GM and 16% CFU-mix). On day 8, 5% of the cells were
clonogenic, 90% of these being BFU-Es. Late erythroid CFU-
E progenitors proliferated extensively and constituted 57%
of the clonogenic cell population by day 10 (Figure 2). Cells
in culture lost their immaturity as early as day 8 as assessed
by CD34, CD117, and CD33 negativity, while their erythroid
commitment was conﬁrmed by CD235a, CD71, and CD36
positivity. Day 18 cultured RBCs were CD235a+. These cells
still expressed CD36 and CD71 markers, as was also observed
in our model using CB and BM sources (Figure 3(a)).
On an MS5 stromal layer, FL CD34+ cells displayed the
same erythroid maturation kinetics as CD34+ cells from
other sources (CB, BM, or peripheral blood, data not shown)
up to day 15. However, their erythroid maturation was
blocked by day 18 at the acidophilic stage, and very little
nucleus expulsion was observed (3 to 15%) (Figure 3(b)). On
the hypothesis that a fetal microenvironment would provide
a more suitable niche to achieve complete maturation, we
established cocultures over autologous or allogeneic MSCs
grown from the FL CD34 negative fractions, but with no

3.2. Hemoglobin Analysis of FL-Derived Erythroid Cells.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of total RNA at diﬀerent
times of culture (days 8, 11, 15, and 18) showed that, except
for the β globin gene whose expression is constant regardless
of the stage of the culture, the expression level of mRNA
coding for the other globin genes is upregulated during the
erythroid diﬀerentiation process.
More particularly, the globin gene expression of the
FL-derived erythroid cells showed to be mainly embryonic
(ζ and ε globin chains) and fetal (γ globin chains). No adult
β globin gene expression could be detected. BM-derived
erythroid cells showed an adult globin proﬁle as they mainly
expressed β globin chains and to lesser extent fetal (α, γ)
globin chains. No embryonic genes (ζ- and ε-globin chains)
could be detected. CB-derived erythroid cells showed a
similar gene proﬁle but had a stronger expression of the fetal
γ-globin chains; embryonic genes (ζ- and ε-globin chains)
could be detected but with a variable and low expression
(Figure 4(a)).

an acetylated fraction. A very early migrating subfraction
was detected and could be identiﬁed as Bart Hb, which
corresponds to the association of four γ globin chains. At
the end of culture (days 19–24), 86% (80–89%) of the cells
contained HbF and less than 2% (1.2–1.8%) adult HbA
(Figure 4(b)).

3.3. Gene Expression of Factors Involved in Deﬁnitive Ery-
thropoiesis. In an attempt to explain the blockage at the
acidophilic stage of the FL-derived erythroid cells, we
analyzed the expression pattern of factors known to be
involved in deﬁnitive erythropoiesis. We compared PCR
results with those obtained for BM and CB samples taken at
the same time of erythroid culture (days 8, 11, 15, 18). The
2−ΔΔCt method was applied to establish relative expression of
genes (Figure 5).
As compared to BM or CB samples, RT-PCR revealed
a strong downregulation of all genes for FL-derived cells
regardless of the stage of the culture. BM and CB had the
same expression pattern of factors except for STAT5a factor
(for which CB showed the same proﬁle as FL). We also
observed that the levels of gene expression were higher for
BM than for CB.
4. Discussion
A large variety of ontogenic sources of HSC have been
explored for cellular therapies. Because of constantly increas-
ing demand in blood supplies, one particular ﬁeld of
interest is transfusion. Thus, we and others have described
experimental procedures which allow the massive expansion
of CD34+ cells from various sources and the generation of
mature RBCs [1, 2, 19–22]. To date, the most proliferative
and accessible source of stem cells for generating cultured
RBCs (cRBCs) is cord blood. It presents, nevertheless,
the drawbacks of being restricted to voluntary donations
and is not unlimited; 1 CB unit gives one batch of cRBC
production.
Because they are an unlimited source of stem cells, many
studies are being carried out with ES cells and more recently
with iPS. Critical advances have allowed progress towards the
in vitro production of functional RBC from these sources in
a few years. However their limited ability to expand in vitro
is a limitation to large-scale production.
In human development, FL is a rich source of hematopoi-
etic progenitors between the 8th and the 22nd week of
gestation as it is the exclusive site of erythropoiesis. Although
“conventional” sources of HSC for generating cRBC include
both adult (mobilized peripheral blood or CB) and primitive
stem cells (ES or iPS cells), evidence suggests that FL may
represent a rich alternative source of “early” HSCs, displaying
multipotency, possessing high proliferative and repopulating
potential [23–26]. Indeed, it has been proven to be eﬃcient
in transplantation [27–29].
In the present work, we addressed the question of the
possibility of generating in vitro mature cells from HSC of
such an intermediate ontogenic source (FL cells) between
ES cells and adult cells. In our experimental conditions,
FL cell maturation is mainly blocked at the acidophilic
stage. Indeed, only few cells (3–15%) achieved terminal
diﬀerentiation. We made the hypothesis that the blockade
of maturation observed in vitro was the consequence of an
inappropriate microenvironment. On the assumption that
a microenvironment from the same ontogenic stage would
better support erythroid diﬀerentiation, we cocultured FL-
derived CD34+ cells on FL-derived MSC instead of the
murine MS5 stromal cell line. However, no diﬀerence was
observed in terms of terminal maturation, and the produced
cells were mostly nucleated, whereas in the same culture
conditions adult stem cells could generate fully enucleated
cRBC. When we analyzed by RT-PCR globin transcripts of
FL-derived erythroid cells, the transcriptomic proﬁles were
mainly fetal (γ-globin chains) and embryonic (ζ- and ε-
globin chains). In the same way, BM-derived erythroid cells
showed an adult globin proﬁle as they mainly expressed
β-globin chain and to lesser extent fetal chains (α-, γ-
globin chains). No embryonic genes (ζ- and ε-globin chains)
could be detected. In comparison, CB-derived erythroid cells
showed a similar gene proﬁle but had a stronger expression
of the fetal γ-globin chains and embryonic genes (ζ- and
ε-globin chains) could be detected but with a variable and
low expression. By analyzing the globin genes expression,
we could observe that our system of culture mimics what
happens during development and leads to globin gene
expression patterns in accordance with the cells’ ontogeny.
The precise molecular mechanisms that regulate the ery-
throid diﬀerentiation process remain to be fully elucidated
despite many genes and pathways have been described to be
essential in erythropoiesis. In order to understand the reason
for the enucleation deﬁciency observed with FL cells, we
analyzed by RT-PCR the expression of some genes known to
be involved in deﬁnitive erythropoiesis (i.e., GATA-1, FOG 1,
SOX6, GFI 1b, STAT5a, FOXO3a) upon the following ratio-
nale. GATA-1 is found exclusively in hematopoietic cells and
is particularly important in erythroid and megakaryocytic
lineages. In vitro, in the absence of GATA-1, a maturation
deﬁcit can be observed, indicating its crucial role in terminal
erythroid diﬀerentiation [30]. FOG-1-null embryos present
a defect both in primitive and deﬁnitive erythropoiesis with
a blockage of maturation at the stage of proerythroblast [31].
The signal transducer and activator of transcription
STAT5 is responsible for the control of proliferation, diﬀer-
entiation, and apoptosis, via its eﬀect on gene expression.
STAT5 proteins [32] are suggested to play an important
role in hematopoiesis, but there are numerous contradictory
reports on the role of STAT5 in normal hematopoietic cell
development. A recent study [33] shows that overexpression
of an activated mutant of (STAT5) induces erythropoiesis
and increases long-term proliferation of human hematopoi-
etic stem/progenitor cells. siRNA silencing of FOXO3a as well
as the inactivation of GFI 1b led to erythroid diﬀerentiation
blockage [34, 35]. Finally, it has been reported that, in
CD34+ from CB, SOX6 accelerated the kinetics of erythroid
maturation and increased the number of cells that reached
the ﬁnal enucleation step [36].
Our results clearly show that, in our culture conditions,
all the genes we studied are strongly downregulated in FL
cells, whereas they are upregulated both in BM and CB
cells, notably in BM cells. The pattern of gene expression
that we observed was in concordance with the enucleation
defect observed in FL but could not fully explain it. Indeed
this molecular analysis is qualitative and not functional.
Nevertheless, it suggests that genes involved in terminal
diﬀerentiation are diﬀerently regulated in the function of
the cell ontogeny and might at least in part explain the

Figure 5: Gene expression of factors involved in deﬁnitive erythropoiesis. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of genes known to be implied
in deﬁnitive erythropoiesis at diﬀerent times of culture (days 8, 11, 15, and 18). Relative gene expression is given by the 2−ΔΔCt method where
ΔΔCt represents the diﬀerence of an unknown sample (days 8, 11, 15, and 18 of culture) versus a control (day 0 of culture) for a target gene
normalized to a control gene (GAPDH).
diﬀerences observed in the ability to generate RBC in vitro.
For many reasons, ES or iPS cells would be the natural
candidates for the regenerative medicine of tomorrow.
Through this model of erythropoiesis, one can understand
how diﬀerent cells behave according to their ontogeny. As it
is titled in the publication of Williams et al. “Children are
not little adults: just ask their hematopoietic stem cells” [37].
Extensive analysis on models explaining these diﬀerences
would be of great interest to fully control the diﬀerentiation
pathway of stem cells and would be helpful for the next
generation of stem cell therapy.
Even if the generation of RBCs from ES cells or iPS has
been quite routinely achieved by several teams [6–13], none
succeeded in a 100% enucleated population whatever the
culture conditions. Primitive cells seem to underperform in
terms of production yield of fully mature cRBCs in vitro. The
question whether this is due to their ontogeny or related to
inappropriate culture conditions remains open.
If FL has no advantage in terms of ﬁnal maturation
over pluripotent stem cells, we observed an interest in
terms of ampliﬁcation. As far as the hematopoietic pathway
is concerned, FL is known to contain a compartment of
Stem Cells International 9
colony-forming cells with a high proliferative potential [14,
23–25]. These observations were conﬁrmed by our ﬁndings
of (i) a strong expansion of CD34+ FL cells and (ii) 100%
cloning eﬃciency in hematopoietic progenitor assays after 3
days of erythroid induction, as compared to 10–15% cloning
eﬃciency for adult CD34+ cells [17]. The proliferation capac-
ity of stem cells from various sources is partly related to their
ontogenic origin. ontogeny-related changes in proliferative
potential of human hematopoietic cells in vitro have already
been suggested in the literature, and analyses have shown, by
comparing bone marrow, peripheral blood, umbilical cord
blood, and fetal liver, that FL appears to represent a good
target for ex vivo stem cell expansion [38, 39].
We reproduced this observation in our culture con-
ditions. Indeed, we observed a 100,000- and 25,000-fold
expansion for cells from CB, BM, respectively. Strikingly, for
FL-derived CD34+ cells, in the same culture conditions, the
expansion reached more than 1.2 × 106
-fold.
FL remains a model of study and is not a candidate as
a direct source of stem cells for ex vivo RBCs production
for blood transfusion. On the contrary, because iPS cells can
proliferate indeﬁnitely, they are obviously the best candidate
to set up complementary sources of RBCs for transfusion.
But their clinical application will need a drastic increase of
their ability to proliferate in vitro. The present observations
relating to erythropoiesis from FL could pave the way for
the design of new strategies to generate induced pluripotent
stem cells. This idea is supported by the work of Kim et al.
[40]. In a murine model, these authors observed that iPS
harbor residual methylation signatures of their somatic tissue
of origin, which favors their diﬀerentiation into lineages
related to the donor cells while restricting alternative cell
fates. According to this logic, we could imagine that a cell
with a high proliferative capacity thereby would be optimal
for the production of RBC.
