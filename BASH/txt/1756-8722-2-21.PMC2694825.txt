Abstract
Cisplatin depletes MGMT and increases the sensitivity of leukemia cells to temozolomide. We
performed a phase I study of cisplatin and temozolomide in patients with relapsed and refractory
acute leukemia. Fifteen patients had AML, 3 had ALL, and 2 had biphenotypic leukemia. The median
number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 3 (1–5). Treatment was well tolerated up to the
maximal doses of temozolomide 200 mg/m2/d times 7 days and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on day 1. There
was one complete remission in this heavily pretreated patient population. Five of 20 (25%) patients
demonstrated a significant reduction in bone marrow blasts.
Background
With currently available chemotherapy regimens, most
patients with acute leukemia will not be cured[1,2]. There
is an ongoing effort to develop new agents to treat this dis-
ease. Temozolomide is a cytotoxic alkylating agent that is
approved by the United States Food and Drug Administra-
tion for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed
glioblastoma multiforme as well adult patients with
refractory anaplastic astrocytoma. Preclinical studies dem-
onstrated that temozolomide is active against a broad
range of tumor cell lines, including L1210 and P388
leukemia[3,4].
Based on in vitro sensitivity of leukemia cell lines to temo-
zolomide as well as the favorable toxicity profile of the
drug, we conducted a phase I study of temozolomide in
patients with relapsed and refractory acute leukemia[5].
Dose escalation occurred by increasing the number of
days that patients received a temozolomide dose of 200
mg/m2. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression,
manifested as prolonged aplasia in patients receiving 9
days of temozolomide. Extra-medullary toxicity was mild,
consisting of nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness and
constipation. The recommended phase II dose of temo-
zolomide was 200 mg/m2/d for 7 days. Significant anti-
leukemic activity was seen in this heavily-pretreated
patient population. Two patients obtained formal com-
plete remissions (CR), and 2 other patients had complete
remission without platelet recovery (CRp). In addition, 5
other patients had significant decreases in bone marrow
blasts despite not obtaining a formal response (total of 9
of 20 patients had a significant decrease in bone marrow
blasts).
One obstacle to temozolomide cytotoxicity is the DNA
repair enzyme, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltrans-
ferase (MGMT)[6,7]. Temozolomide acts predominantly
through methylation of O6-guanine in DNA[8,9]. This
results in mispairing of guanine with thymine, and, in the
presence of active mismatch repair, DNA strand breaks
and apoptosis[10,11]. MGMT removes these methyl
groups which would have otherwise led to apoptotic cell

death. Since MGMT becomes irreversibly inactivated in
this process, the degree to which a cell can repair itself is
inversely proportional to the level of MGMT present[12].
Laboratory studies have shown that only 25% of leukemia
cells demonstrate low levels of MGMT[13]. Therefore,
strategies to deplete MGMT in these cells could potentially
render them more sensitive to temozolomide. One strat-
egy is to combine temozolomide with other agents that
deplete MGMT, such as cisplatin. Piccioni demonstrated
that cisplatin and temozolomide were synergistic in
leukemia cell lines, and that in vivo treatment of leukemic
patients with cisplatin was followed by a reduction of
MGMT activity in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells[14]. D'Atri et al reported that, in Jurkat cells, cisplatin
decreased MGMT activity in a time- and dose- dependent
manner with maximal suppression observed 24 hours
after treatment with cisplatin[15]. Thus, cisplatin is poten-
tially one agent that could increase the efficacy of temo-
zolomide. Based on these data we performed a phase I
study of cisplatin and temozolomide in patients with
relapsed and refractory acute leukemia.
Methods
Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or chronic myelogenous
leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP) that had either
relapsed following, or was refractory to standard chemo-
therapy were eligible. Additional entry criteria included
age greater than 17 years, an ECOG Performance Status of
0–3, serum bilirubin less than 1.5 mg/dl, serum creatinine
< 2.0 mg/dl and a creatinine clearance greater than 60 cc/
min. Patients must have recovered from any toxicity from
previous chemotherapy regimens. Patients must not have
received chemotherapy (other than hydroxyurea) in the 4
weeks prior to entry into this study.
All patients gave written informed consent under the
guidance of the New York Medical College Institutional
Review Board.
Pretreatment evaluation included a complete history and
physical examination, bone marrow aspiration and
biopsy for histology, cytogenetics, and flow cytometry,
and routine laboratory studies including CBC with differ-
ential, chemistry profile and coagulation studies.
Treatment
Cisplatin was administered on day 1 of therapy. The dose
of cisplatin was escalated from 50 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 as
in Table 1. Patients received standard hydration and
antiemetics during cisplatin administration. Temozolo-
mide was administered at a dose of 200 mg/m2/d, orally
as a single dose on an empty stomach. The first dose of
temozolomide was given 4 hours after the completion of
cisplatin. The initial group of patients received temozolo-
mide for 5 days every cycle. Patients treated at higher dose
levels received 7 days of temozolomide (Table 1). Patients
were eligible to receive subsequent cycles of therapy
unless they had evidence of progressive disease (bone
marrow blasts or peripheral blood blasts greater than pre-
treatment). Treatment was given every 21–28 days, pro-
vided there was no persistent non-hematologic toxicity.
Patients remained on treatment until there was evidence
of progression of disease. Patients who had intolerable
toxicity during a course of treatment could receive subse-
quent cycles at one dose level lower than that at which
toxicity occurred.
Patients were entered in cohorts of 3 at the different dose
levels stated. Temozolomide was increased to the dose
determined in our original phase I study, and cisplatin
was increased to 100 mg/m2.
Patients were assessed for clinical signs and symptoms of
toxicity at least twice a week during the first month of
treatment. Stable patients without significant toxicity in
course 1 were monitored at least once a week in subse-
quent cycles. Patients had a bone marrow aspiration and
biopsy approximately 3 weeks after treatment. Patients
with obvious disease progression were not required to
have this procedure. Subsequently, responding patients
were to have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy
monthly for 3 months and then every 3 months until dis-
ease progression. A complete response required [1] the
presence of a cellular marrow with less than 5% blasts and
trilineage maturation, and [2] return of peripheral blood
counts: absolute neutrophil count >1000/mm3, hemo-
globin (untransfused) >10 gm/dl, and platelet count
(untransfused) >100,000/mm3. Patients must have dem-
onstrated these criteria for at least 4 weeks.

are summarized in Table 2. Fifteen patients had AML, of
whom 5 patients had MDS that evolved to AML and one
had aplastic anemia that evolved to AML. Five of the
patients with AML had primary refractory disease. Three
patients had relapsed ALL. Two patients had acute biphe-
notypic leukemia. One of these had primary refractory
disease. Patients had received a median of 3 prior inten-
sive chemotherapy regimens for their acute leukemia
(range 1–5 treatments). The median duration of first
remission for those patients who were not initially refrac-
tory was 9 months (range 3–31 months) for patients with
AML, and 6 months (range 3–17 months) for patients
with ALL. Three patients had relapsed after stem cell trans-
plants (1 autologous, 2 allogeneic). Of the patients with
AML, two had t(8;21), twelve had intermediate risk
cytogenetics and two had poor risk cytogenetics. Of the
patients with ALL, two had normal cytogenetics and one
was hypodiploid. Of the patients with biphenotypic
leukemia, one had complex cytogenetics and the other
had t(9;22).
Toxicity
Overall treatment was well tolerated. There were no true
dose limiting toxicities. Due to the need for hydration,
most patients received their chemotherapy in the hospital.
The median number of hospital days was 9 (range 0–39).
Hematologic toxicity is difficult to assess in this patient
population. All patients had significantly abnormal blood
counts at the start of therapy. There was no evidence of
prolonged myelosuppression. For the limited number of
patients who received more than one cycle, the median
time between cycles was 21 days (range 21–28). The
median number of red blood cell transfusions per cycle
was 4 range (0–8) and the median number of platelet
transfusions was 4 (range 0–12). Only 8 patients required
intravenous antibiotics. The remaining 12 patients did
not develop neutropenic fever, presumably due to the use
of prophylactic oral antibiotics. For all patients, the
median number of days of intravenous antibiotics was 3
(range 0–33 days); for those who did require intravenous
antibiotics the median number of days was 13 (range 3–
33 days).
Other grade 1/2 toxicities included nausea and vomiting
in seven patients and constipation in three patients. One
additional patient (treated at level 4) developed grade 3
constipation. Two patients developed grade 2 orthostatic
hypotension (one patient day 8, level 2, and the other day
6, level 3). Two other patients developed asymptomatic
bradycardia that occurred during chemotherapy adminis-
tration (days 2–7) and resolved spontaneously. Both of
these patients were treated at level 4. Due to the use of cis-
platin, it was anticipated that patients would develop
increases in creatinine as well as hypokalemia and
hypomagnesemia. Therefore patients received hydration
with supplementation of potassium and magnesium sup-
plementation preemptively, provided they did not have
hyperkalemia due to tumor lysis. Despite this, four
patients developed grade 1/2 elevated creatinine (one
patient level 2, three patients level 3). None of the patients
treated at level 4 developed an increased creatinine, indi-
cating that patient factors other than cisplatin dose were
important in predicting this toxicity. There was no grade
3/4 renal toxicity. In all of the patients the abnormalities
were rapidly reversible. Two patients treated at level 4
developed significant hypomagnesemia (grade 2) and
hypokalemia (one grade 3, one grade 4). These abnormal-
ities responded rapidly to aggressive supplementation.
Antileukemic Effect
One patient (treated at level 4) had a formal complete
remission. This patient had de novo AML with normal
cytogenetics. Her first remission duration (after 3 + 7 ther-
apy) was only 3 months. She then failed to respond to ida-
rubicin and high dose cytarabine. This patient only
received one cycle of cisplatin and temozolomide; she
declined further chemotherapy and expired in relapse 3
months after treatment. Two other patients (both treated
at level 4) had dramatic reductions in bone marrow blasts
in their bone marrow (pretreatment 69% and 87% blasts,
to post-treatment 3% and 5% blasts, respectively). These
patients did not meet criteria for complete remission due
to a lack of peripheral count recovery. The mean percent-
age of blasts prior to and following treatment for the dif-
ferent dose levels is summarized in Figure 1. There was a
trend towards increased antileukemic effect in patients
treated at the highest dose level compared to the other
dose levels (p = 0.07). At level 4, the mean percentage
blasts in the marrow was 67% prior to treatment and 18%
following treatment.

Discussion
This study demonstrates that the combination of temo-
zolomide and cisplatin is well tolerated in a heavily pre-
treated group of patients with acute leukemia. No dose
limiting toxicity was seen with the addition of cisplatin to
the full dose of temozolomide that was administered as a
single agent in our previous study. Toxitcities were as
expected and included myelosuppression, nausea, vomit-
ing and (mild) renal and electrolyte abnormalities. We
chose not to increase temozolomide beyond the dose in
our other study and did not escalate cisplatin beyond that
which is recommended in other malignancies.
Antileukemic activity was demonstrated, particularly at
the highest dose level. Of 8 patients treated at this level,
there was one complete remission and 2 other patients
had 5% or fewer blasts in the bone marrow without
peripheral count recovery. Although the complete remis-
sion rate at this level is only 14%, this group of patients is
notoriously difficult to treat. Estey et al reported that for
patients with AML in first relapse, only 11% of those
whose first remission was less than 12 months achieved a
complete remission with high dose cytarabine-based sal-
vage therapy[16]. Five patients in the current study were
treated as first salvage. All had a first remission duration
of less than one year. Patients beyond first salvage are even
more difficult to treat. Giles et al reported the outcome of
594 patients with AML undergoing second salvage ther-
apy[17]. Overall, 13% of patients achieved a complete
remission. Six adverse prognostic factors were identified:
first complete remission duration less than 6 months, sec-
ond complete remission duration less than 6 months, sal-
vage therapy not including allogeneic stem cell transplant,
non-inversion 16 AML, platelet count less than 50 × 109/
l, and leukocytosis greater than 50 × 109/l. Patients were
divided into prognostic groups based on the number of
risk factors they had. In the current study only 3 patients
were treated as second salvage. According to the Giles cri-
teria one of them would have an anticipated CR rate of 8%
and two would have an anticipated CR rate of 0%. The
other AML patients treated in this study were beyond sec-
ond salvage. Thus the low complete remission rate seen in
our study is not unexpected.
One question is whether the addition of cisplatin to temo-
zolomide is synergistic or at least additive. In our previous
study of 20 patients who received temozolomide as a sin-
gle agent there were 2 formal complete remissions (10%),
and 2 complete remissions without platelet recovery
(10%)[5]. In that study, nine patients (30%) had a signif-
icant decrease in bone marrow blasts. In the current study
there was one complete remission (5%), and 5 patients
(25%) had a significant reduction in bone marrow blasts.
Only 13 patients received 7 days of temozolomide (the
minimum dose in the single agent study) on the current
study. In this subset, the percentage of patients with
reduction in bone marrow blasts (5/13, i.e. 38%) was
comparable to that seen in the single agent study. There-
fore it would appear that the efficacy of the two drug reg-
imen was comparable to the single agent regimen.

However due to the small number of patients and hetero-
geneity of the patient groups it is impossible to draw any
conclusions. A larger study would be needed to answer
this question.
Another question is why cisplatin has not been used to
any degree in the treatment of acute leukemia. Clearly
there is in vitro data showing that some leukemia cell
lines are sensitive to cisplatin [18] Complete remissions
have also been reported in relapsed and refractory AML
patients treated with carboplatin[19]. Undoubtedly there
could be a reluctance to use an agent that causes renal and
electrolyte abnormalities in a group of patients who are at
high risk of these complications from their disease (tumor
lysis) and supportive care (antibiotics). However with cur-
rently available supportive measures these issues are easily
managed. In the current study several patients with high
white blood cell counts (as high as 78,000/mm3) had
rapid reductions in their peripheral counts. It was our
impression that the reduction in peripheral counts was
more rapid with the addition of cisplatin than with temo-
zolomide alone, suggesting that the former is an active
agent in this disease.
MGMT expression is an important mechanism of resist-
ance to temozolomide. This has been demonstrated in gli-
omas [12] as well as in leukemia. Brandwein et al
conducted a phase II study of temozolomide in poor
prognosis AML patients 60 years of age or older [20]. Of
46 patients treated there were 3 complete remissions and
2 complete remissions without platelet recovery for an
overall response rate of 11%. In previously untreated
patients the overall response rate was 22%. Twenty-eight
samples were obtained for MGMT analysis. The frequency
of MGMT negativity was higher in previously untreated
patients than in previously treated patients. Absent
MGMT expression was significantly correlated with higher
likelihood of response to temozolomide. The overall
response rate was 60% for patients who were MGMT neg-
ative compared to 6% for patients with expression of
MGMT. In the previously treated patients there was only
one patient with no MGMT expression and that patient
was the only one to attain complete remission. Caporaso
et al have also added the MGMT inhibitor lomeguatrib to
patients with refractory leukemia receiving temozolo-
mide. Patients also received IL-2 subsequent to their
chemotherapy. In this study six of eight heavily pretreated
patients showed partial or complete disappearance of
blast cells in the peripheral blood or bone marrow [21].
Conclusion
In this phase I study in patients with relapsed/refractory
acute leukemia, treatment was well tolerated up to the
maximal doses of temozolomide 200 mg/m2/d times 7
days and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on day 1. Significant anti-
leukemic activity was observed. Further studies with direct
measurement of MGMT levels could determine which
patients are likely to benefit from this therapy.
