The telomeres of most eukaryotes are characterized by
guanine-rich repeats synthesized by the reverse transcrip-
tase telomerase. Complete loss of telomerase is tolerated
for several generations in most species, but modestly
reduced telomerase levels in human beings are implicated
in bone marrow failure, pulmonary ﬁbrosis and a spec-
trum of other diseases including cancer. Differences in
telomerase deﬁciency phenotypes between species most
likely reﬂect a tumour suppressor function of telomeres in
long-lived mammals that does not exist as such in short-
lived organisms. Another puzzle provided by current
observations is that family members with the same genetic
defect, haplo-insufﬁciency for one of the telomerase genes,
can present with widely different diseases. Here, the
crucial role of telomeres and telomerase in human (stem
cell) biology is discussed from a Darwinian perspective.
It is proposed that the variable phenotype and penetrance
of heritable human telomerase deﬁciencies result from
additional environmental, genetic and stochastic factors
or combinations thereof.

Introduction
Several recent studies have highlighted the tremendous im-
portance of telomeres in clinical medicine (Yamaguchi et al,
2005; Armanios et al, 2007; Calado et al, 2009). These
advances provide an opportunity to revisit some of the
concepts and data that provide a link between telomeres,
the turnover of various (stem) cells and the diverse pathology
that is now linked to telomere dysfunction. This aim of this
essay is not to provide a comprehensive review of the many
papers that have implicated telomeres in human disease.
Instead, I hope to provide some insight into this broad and
complex topic by reviewing ideas and data from selected
publications in very diverse areas.
The chicken or the egg?
The Russian evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky,
wrote ‘Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of
Evolution’ (Dobzhansky, 1973).1
The essential truth in this
statement is in my view exempliﬁed by a remarkable differ-
ence in telomere function between human beings and most
other eukaryotes. This difference is illustrated by the con-
sequences of complete and partial telomerase deﬁciencies.
Strikingly, complete loss of telomerase is tolerated for several
generations in yeast, worms, plants and mice (Table I).
In each of these species, the loss of telomerase results in a
measurable and predictable decline in average telomere
length with each subsequent generation. After four or more
generations without major changes in growth or develop-
ment, telomeres become too short to protect chromosome
ends and problems start to occur. Chromosome ends without
sufﬁcient telomere repeats typically are prone to fusion and
the resulting dicentric chromosomes compromise the ability
of cells to continue cell division.2
Chromosome fusions and
other molecular changes in cells of late generation telomer-
ase-null mutant animals or plants result in a plethora of
phenotypes. Most typical are a failure to reproduce, variable
growth defects, accelerated ‘ageing’ in some tissues and
failed or delayed responses to tissue injury. In stark contrast
to these consequences in late generation telomerase-null
animals or plants are the often severe and life-threatening
clinical phenotypes observed in patients with a modest, two-
fold reduction in telomerase levels (e.g. resulting from haplo-
insufﬁciency for one of the two essential telomerase genes)
(Table I). What could be the explanation for these phenotypic
differences?
In evolutionary terms, the cells of the germline are the
most important cells: only the gametes produced by the cells
of the germline have the potential to cross generations,
whereas somatic cells are inevitably lost with each generation
(Figure 1). The disposable soma theory provides a useful
paradigm to think about reproduction, somatic cells and
ageing (Kirkwood and Holliday, 1979). Cells of the germline
and soma are of course highly integrated. All somatic cells
and tissues, including our brain, reﬂect an evolutionary
strategy to propagate germline DNA. Most people do not
(like to) see themselves as the mortal carriers of precious,
highly selected DNA contained in cells of the germline.
However, the notion that our soma serves to propagate
germline DNA and is ‘disposable’ in the bigger scheme
of things is useful in considering possible differences in

The consequences of fused and broken chromosomes in cells differ
greatly between species. For example, multiple anaphase bridges were
observed in late generation telomerase-null Arabidopsis plants. This
level of genomic instability is not tolerated by mammalian cells (see
Riha et al, 2001).

telomere biology and DNA repair between cells, tissues and
species.
At the single cell level, many signalling and cell cycle
checkpoint pathways are integrated to allow cells to make
life or death decisions (Cook et al, 2009). Many of the
molecules involved in such decisions are highly conserved
between species. However, constant selective pressure has
also resulted in very speciﬁc differences between cells and
between species. No doubt, many aspects of the pathways
involved in cell signalling and cell cycle checkpoints and their
connectivity remain to be uncovered and better understood
within speciﬁc cells. Differences in such pathways within
cells of a given species need to be understood better before
the added complexity of species-speciﬁc differences can be
fruitfully dissected. However, in the context of growth control
and malignant transformation, some differences between
species have already been described. For example, DNA
damage foci originating from short, dysfunctional telomeres
(d’Adda di Fagagna et al, 2003) increase in number with
accumulated cell divisions and with age in human and
primate cells, but not in murine somatic cells and tissues
(Sedivy, 2007). These and other observations (Hahn et al,
1999; Smogorzewska and de Lange, 2002) support the idea
that loss of telomeric DNA prevents tumour growth and
contributes to ageing in human beings and primates, but
probably does not function in this way in laboratory mice
(with long telomeres), plants, worms, ﬂies and yeast.
Interestingly, telomere loss can be made to also limit cell
proliferation and tissue renewal in mice (Hao et al, 2005;
Deng et al, 2008). In these studies, cell proliferation appears
to be limited primarily by telomere loss and only indirectly by
telomerase levels.
Differences in DNA repair between cells and
species?
Consider two species with a greatly different lifespan. The
comparable somatic (stem) cells from such species are ex-
pected to have different requirements in terms of the type and
efﬁciency of various DNA repair pathways to ensure that
germline DNA is successfully propagated across generations.
According to the ‘disposable soma’ hypothesis, ageing results
primarily from failure to maintain genome integrity in so-
matic cells after reproduction (Kirkwood and Holliday, 1979).
The key concept here is that organisms with cells that do
spend more energy on DNA repair and other cellular ‘main-
tenance’ functions than is strictly required for production of
viable offspring are likely to be at a disadvantage relative to
those that do not. Thus, differences in lifespan and repro-
ductive strategy between species will be reﬂected in differ-
ences between the type and efﬁciency of various DNA repair
pathways. The notion that the efﬁciency of DNA repair is
subject to natural selection is not as popular as the more
commonly emphasized ideas that evolution proceeds by
selection of variants within a species that carry favourable
DNA mutations or the simpler notion that ageing is a
consequence of DNA damage (Schumacher et al, 2008). The
emphasis on DNA repair rather than DNA damage in the
context of ageing has practical implications: a focus on
increasing the efﬁciency of DNA repair is not the same as a

Natural selection results in somatic (stem) cells that do not devote more energy on DNA repair and tissue maintenance than is required for the
reproductive strategy and corresponding lifespan of a particular species. According to the ‘disposable soma’ theory, ageing is not actively
programmed, but results from the accumulation of damage after reproduction (Kirkwood and Holliday, 1979). Long-lived species that
reproduce after many years need more efﬁcient DNA repair and better protection against tumour development than comparable species that
reproduce within weeks or months. Somatic cells from long-lived species show loss of telomeric DNA with each division. Telomere loss is not
readily observed in cells from most short-lived species. Most likely loss of telomeric DNA represents a tumour suppressor mechanism that does
not exist as such in somatic cells from short-lived species.

focus on reducing DNA damage. Indeed, limited exposure to
DNA damage could stimulate repair and be more effective at
increasing lifespan (Kaiser, 2003) than attempts to limit DNA
damage altogether (e.g. with ‘anti-oxidants’). This line of
reasoning is supported by the known beneﬁt of (moderate)
exercise and low-dose irradiation on the lifespan in various
organisms (Calabrese and Baldwin, 2003; Radak et al, 2008).
No doubt, many differences in the type and efﬁciency of
DNA repair pathways in speciﬁc cells within tissues and
comparable (stem) cells between species remain to be un-
covered. However, some notable differences have already
been described. For example, DNA repair changes dramati-
cally during neuronal differentiation (Nouspikel and
Hanawalt, 2000) and the repair of double strand (ds) DNA
breaks through molecules such as Ku70/80 and DNA-PK in
the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway is much
more efﬁcient in human than in murine cells (Banuelos et al,
2008 and references therein). Differences in NHEJ between
mice and man could reﬂect the fact that human (stem) cells
reside for much longer periods in a dormant G0 or G1 state of
the cell cycle compared with their murine counterparts.
Repair of ds DNA breaks through homologous recombination
is less efﬁcient in G0 or G1 (Aylon et al, 2004) and better
NEJH repair of DNA (ds) breaks in human cells may reﬂect
the slower turnover of human cells (Wilson et al, 2008). The
main point here is that the efﬁciency and the type of DNA
repair in somatic as well as germline cells have been and are
subject to natural selection. As a result, the efﬁciency of DNA
repair in stem cells from species that reproduce rapidly is
expected to be less than that in stem cells from species that
take years to reproduce.3
Highly effective DNA repair required in somatic stem cells
from long-lived species creates a novel risk: abnormal so-
matic stem cells, though perhaps less likely to arise, are more
likely to propagate their abnormal genomes and survive.
Such risks are superimposed on the inherent risk of living
longer: more time for mutations to accumulate. It seems
plausible that the additional risks to stem cells in long-lived
species have favoured the evolution of telomere attrition as a
tumour suppression mechanism (reviewed in Aubert and
Lansdorp, 2008). The lack of a similar telomere-related
counting mechanism in short-lived species and model organ-
isms provides an explanation for the different consequences
of telomerase deﬁciency in human beings and model organ-
isms (Table I). Unfortunately, the tumour suppressor function
of telomeres in human cells poses a major hurdle in studies of
human telomere biology. For example, suitable murine mod-
els for human carcinomas, the most common type of human
malignancies, are only obtained after telomere function is
severely compromised (Artandi et al, 2000). The difference in
telomere biology between mice and man has also hampered
the development of suitable murine models for other human
diseases including Werner’s syndrome (Chang et al, 2004).
If one accepts that telomere loss indeed evolved to limit the
growth of pre-malignant cells in human beings, it should be
noted that this mechanism has two serious ﬂaws (Figure 2).
First, the mechanism is subject to failure when two chromo-
some ends with insufﬁcient telomere repeats fuse with each
other. Such fusion events (e.g. between sister chromatids or
between different chromosome ends) will extinguish the
DNA damage signals that originated from the short telomeres.
The removal of this checkpoint is predicted to allow cells to
enter mitosis. Dicentric chromosomes formed by end-to-end
fusion are likely to break on mitosis and initiate cycles of
chromosome bridge/breakage/fusion (de Lange, 1995). This
type of genome instability greatly facilitates deletion and
ampliﬁcation of genes and, as a result, the malignant evolu-
tion of (pre-) malignant cells. Second, by limiting the growth
of (pre-) malignant cells, the DNA damage response triggered
by short telomeres (d’Adda di Fagagna et al, 2003) will
become subject to strong negative selective pressure. Such
selection favours cells with defective DNA damage responses.
Indeed, this seems a plausible mechanism, whereby most
human tumours acquire defective DNA damage responses
(e.g. over half of all human cancers have mutations in the p53
gene (Vousden and Lane, 2007)). As DNA damage responses
are upstream in many different DNA repair pathways, cells
selected on the basis of their inability to respond appropri-
ately to short telomeres will display defects in several differ-
ent DNA repair pathways. Indeed, it seems plausible that
genome instability triggered by unstable chromosome ends in
cells with defective DNA damage response result in the
‘mutator cell’ phenotype that is characteristic of many
tumour cells (Loeb, 2001). That chromosomal instability
can be initiated by disruption of telomere function and that
microsatellite instability and other genomic alterations often
seen in cancer cells could arise from defective DNA damage
responses indirectly selected by telomere shortening does not
seem to be widely accepted (Michor et al, 2005). These ideas
nevertheless seem plausible and worthy of further investiga-
tion. Apart from the difﬁculty of ﬁnding suitable model
organisms, such studies are complicated by the transient
period of rampant genome instability driven by telomere
dysfunction. Sooner or later, most abnormal cells typically
stabilize their chromosome ends (and at that stage typically
highly abnormal genomes) by upregulation of telomerase
activity (Kim et al, 1994). The frequent ampliﬁcation of the
telomerase reverse transcriptase gene in human lung cancer
suggests that break–fusion–bridge cycles involving chromo-
some 5p is frequently involved in the upregulation of
telomerase activity in those cells (Weir et al, 2007; Kang
et al, 2008).
How many stem cell divisions?
If telomere attrition evolved to limit the number of somatic
cell divisions in long-lived species, one might ask how many
times stem cells in tissues actually divide. Unfortunately, and
perhaps surprisingly, no clear answer to this important
question is currently available. Haematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) are probably the most extensively studied stem cell
population. From studies of both human and murine HSCs, it
has become clear that HSCs represent a very heterogeneous
population of cells that do not self-renew in the absolute
sense of the word (Lansdorp, 1997). The functional proper-
ties of puriﬁed ‘candidate’ stem cell populations change
markedly during development in both man (Lansdorp et al,
1993) and mouse (Bowie et al, 2006; Kim et al, 2007). Such
functional changes correspond to a rather abrupt change in
3
In this context, it is perhaps of interest to consider that the presence of
many error-prone DNA polymerases in various genomes could reﬂect an
evolutionary advantage of cells capable of generating many mutations
in times of stress; e.g. see Tippin et al, 2004.

HSC turnover early in life, which is reﬂected in a rapid decline
in the rate of telomere attrition after 3–4 years in human
beings (Rufer et al, 1999) and 1–2 years in baboons
(Baerlocher et al, 2007). The turnover of murine HSCs also
drops quite abruptly, but at 4–6 weeks after birth (Bowie
et al, 2007; Kim et al, 2007). The majority of transplantable
HSCs in adult mice are derived from a very small pool of
quiescent cells that divide less than 10 times over a lifetime
(Wilson et al, 2008). The picture that is emerging is that HSCs
are dividing very infrequently in adults and only switch from
dormancy to self-renewal following transplantation or other
stress conditions. Very limited turnover of adult stem cells is
also compatible with the minimal loss of telomere length
observed in granulocytes from normal human individuals
between 20 and 60 years of age (Lansdorp, 2008) and the
sequential recruitment of quiescent progenitors that was
observed to sustain cell production in human long-term
bone marrow cultures (Lansdorp and Dragowska, 1993).
On the basis of telomere length data from different mam-
malian species, it has been proposed that HSCs divide less
than 200 times over a lifetime and that this number is
evolutionarily conserved (Shepherd et al, 2007). If this num-
ber is correct, it suggests that very few cell divisions in the
haematopoietic system are ‘wasted’. The total number of
blood cells required for life-long blood cell production in
man can be calculated to be in the order of 4 Â1016
cells
(B1012
cells/day Â 365 days Â 100 years). In theory, only
55 divisions of a single cell could satisfy this need
(255
¼ 4 Â1016
). With inclusion of additional cell divisions
required to compensate for inevitable cell death and loss
through differentiation, estimates of less than 200 cell divi-
sions over a lifetime seem reasonable.
The estimate of the number of divisions in HSCs is at odds
with the thousands of divisions proposed, for example stem
cells in the gut (Potten et al, 2002). The notion that stem cells
in the intestine of mice divide much more than those in the
bone marrow is also at odds with data from mice that lack
telomerase (Blasco et al, 1997; Liu et al, 2000) and turnover
estimates of tissues, including blood and intestine, derived
from 14
C dating (Spalding et al, 2005). Mice that lack telo-
merase show a loss of around 5 kb per generation (Blasco
et al, 1997). Assuming a loss of 100 bp of telomeric DNA per
cell division, subsequent generations of telomerase-null mice
are calculated to be separated by B50 divisions. This esti-
mate is in close agreement with independent estimates of
34–133 cell divisions in the male and 25 in the female
germline (Figure 3, adopted from Drost and Lee, 1995). If
intestinal stem cells were indeed to divide thousands of

Figure 2 Telomere loss: an imperfect tumour suppressor mechanism. Loss of telomeric DNA after replication or damage to telomeric DNA
limits the proliferation of abnormal (stem) cells. The ﬂaws (red arrow) in the telomere-related tumour suppressor mechanism are illustrated
here in a hypothetical scenario involving the short (p) arm of human chromosome 17. Chromosome 17p was chosen for illustration because it
has a short track of telomere repeats in a majority of normal individuals (Martens et al, 1998; Britt-Compton et al, 2006) and because
abnormalities involving the p53 gene (located on 17p13.1) are present in a majority of human cancers. Critically short telomeres are presumed
to activate a DNA damage response similar to DNA double strand breaks. This DNA damage response (presumably mediated through ATM and
p53) will result in growth arrest or apoptosis in all cells in most instances. However, selection on the basis of intact DNA damage responses will
favour rare cells with (1) defective DNA damage responses or (2) cells in which the short telomeres are fused (eliminating the DNA damage
signal). This can lead to loss of p53, genome instability and a ‘mutator phenotype’ as illustrated. Eventually, cells with high telomerase levels
are selected to stabilize typically highly rearranged tumour genomes. Alternatively, some tumour cells may bypass the ‘telomere checkpoint’
altogether by upregulation of telomerase activity earlier in tumour development.

times, one would expect a severe gut phenotype in the ﬁrst
generation of TERC KO mice unless intestinal stem cells could
somehow avoid telomere loss or maintain telomeres in the
absence of telomerase.4
More likely, intestinal cells, such as
Lgr5þ
cells, that divide every 24 h (Barker et al, 2007) include
a small subset of Lgr5þ
stem cells and a large proportion of
Lgr5þ
progenitor cells similar to CD34 cells in human bone
marrow.5
Only a very small fraction (o1%) of BM CD34þ
cells are probably true HSCs (Terstappen et al, 1991; Novelli
et al, 1998), and only a minor fraction of sorted single Lgr5þ
cells is capable of initiating crypt formation in vitro (Sato
et al, 2009).
Telomerase deﬁciencies and other telomere
disorders
Uncertainties about the number of stem cells in various
tissues and their turnover are important in the discussion of
human telomerase deﬁciency disorders. It seems likely that
most, if not all, phenotypic consequences of human telo-
merase deﬁciency result from compromised telomere
function that limits the proliferation of (stem) cells. If this
is correct, the phenotypic manifestations of telomerase
disorders could in fact instruct us about the turnover of
stem cells in various tissues. This reasoning explains in
part why telomeres and ‘telomerase disorders’ are of interest
to a growing number of ‘stem cell’ researchers.
The ﬁrst and most well-studied ‘telomere disorder’ is
Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC). This is a rare disorder and
fewer than a thousand patients have been described.
Patients with DC typically present with three distinctive
clinical characteristics: skin pigmentation abnormalities,
nail dystrophy and abnormalities of the oral mucosa known
as leukoplakia (Walne and Dokal, 2008; Savage and Alter,
2009). The most common fatal complications of DC are
related to bone marrow failure, pulmonary ﬁbrosis and
cancer (Walne and Dokal, 2008; Savage and Alter, 2009).
The most frequent cancers are head and neck cancer
(squamous cell carcinoma), cancer of the tongue and acute
myeloid leukaemia (Alter et al, 2009). In addition, a variety of
other clinical abnormalities have been described in DC pa-
tients (reviewed in Kirwan and Dokal, 2008). Hepatic cirrho-
sis has been described in DC and severe liver disease is not
uncommon after HSC transplantation for marrow failure in
patients with DC (Calado and Young, 2008). Several genes
have now been implicated in DC; most notably, all three
genes encoding components of the minimal (Cohen et al,
2007) telomerase enzyme complex (Walne and Dokal, 2008;
Savage and Alter, 2009). Mutations were initially discovered
in DKC1, located on the X chromosome (Heiss et al, 1998).
A link with telomerase was ﬁrst suggested when the nucleo-
lar protein encoded by DKC1, dyskerin, was found to stabilize
telomerase RNA and maintain telomere length through telo-
merase (Mitchell et al, 1999). Mutations in hTERC and hTERT
themselves were later discovered in autosomal dominant DC
(Vulliamy et al, 2001; Fogarty et al, 2003; Armanios et al,
2005). In total, B50% of patients with DC have a mutation in
one of the three genes of the telomerase complex (Aubert and
Lansdorp, 2008). It seems likely that mutations in other
‘telomere maintenance’ genes contribute to the remaining
B50% of cases. This notion is supported by the recent
discoveries of mutations in genes of DC patients such as
TINF2, NHP2 and NOP10 (Walne et al, 2007; Savage et al,
2008; Vulliamy et al, 2008).
Mutations in hTERT and hTERC have also been found in
diseases other than DC, including other bone marrow failure
syndromes such as aplastic anaemia (AA) (Yamaguchi et al,
2003, 2005; Marrone et al, 2004; Ly et al, 2005; Vulliamy et al,

Lee, 1995). The number of cell divisions is given below the indicated developmental stages. Thus, to go from a fertilized egg to a blastocyst
takes an estimated 6 divisions; 8 more divisions are needed to produce 150 primary gonadal cells; the latter go through 11 more divisions before
cells commit to either the female germline (1 more cell division before mature oocytes is produced) or the male germline (in which the
estimated number of divisions from stem cell to spermatocyte is 9). Production of spermatocytes in males continues throughout adult life.
Estimates of the number of divisions at the level of spermatogonial stem cells are hampered by uncertainties that are similar to those discussed
for haematopoietic and intestinal stem cells. For the (young) mice without telomerase in laboratory settings, it is estimated that at most 50
divisions separate one generation from the next.

Of note, a gut phenotype was observed in the ﬁrst generation of
CAST/EiJ mice with short telomeres lacking telomerase (Hao et al, 2005).

How this notion can be reconciled with the elegant lacZ lineage tracing
experiments by Barker et al is not clear. Differences in Cre-induced
recombination between cell types and/or variable detection of lacZ in
slowly versus rapidly dividing cells could possibly contribute to the
failure to detect differences in the frequency of lacZ positive crypts at
variable time points after Lgr5-induced Cre expression.

2005) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (Yamaguchi
et al, 2003), and in diseases not typically associated with
blood disorders such as idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis (IPF)
(Armanios et al, 2007). In AA, 3 of 200 patients were found to
have mutations in hTERC (Yamaguchi et al, 2003) and an
additional 3.5% (7/200) had mutations in hTERT (Yamaguchi
et al, 2005). In IPF, 1.4% (1/73) of patients were identiﬁed
with hTERC mutations, whereas 6.8% (5/73) of patients with
familial IPF had mutations in hTERT (Armanios et al, 2007).
Families with mutations in telomerase genes typically dis-
play disease ‘anticipation’, meaning that the disease typically
presents at an earlier age in each subsequent generation
(Vulliamy et al, 2004; Armanios et al, 2005). The most likely
explanation for disease anticipation in telomerase disorders is
that limiting amounts of telomerase activity in the germline
result in gametes with shorter telomeres and, consequently,
offspring with shorter telomeres. Shorter telomeres in stem
cells at birth reduce the number of stem cell divisions before
short telomeres trigger a DNA damage response and, even-
tually, senescence or cell death. It is implied here that all
disease manifestations of telomerase disorders are likely to
result from compromised cell and tissue renewal. From the
spectrum of phenotypes of patients with known telomerase
deﬁciencies, one can deduce that the stem cells of the oral
mucosa, the skin (especially in the head and neck area), the
nails, the lung, the bone marrow and the liver rely on
telomerase to sustain proliferation the most or have the
highest turnover of all the stem cells in the human body.
Why speciﬁc tissues seem to be affected more than
others in individual patients is incompletely understood. It
seems possible that environmental factors contribute to
disease manifestations, for example smoking in patients with
pulmonary ﬁbrosis or alcohol consumption in patients
presenting with hepatic cirrhosis. In such patients, a reduced
stem cell reserve could lead to symptoms by increasing the
demand on the turnover of remaining tissue-speciﬁc stem
cells by environmental toxins. Among environmental
‘toxins’, factors induced by viral or other infections, such as
interferon alpha (Essers et al, 2009), or factors stimulated by,
for example, sustained psychological stress (Epel et al, 2004)
should probably be included. Indeed, such factors are likely
to accelerate tissue turnover and thereby ageing even in
individuals without speciﬁc ‘telomere maintenance’ disor-
ders. Other known or unknown ‘extrinsic’ factors, including
speciﬁc diseases, could also affect tissue-speciﬁc stem cell
numbers. The role of telomere attrition in cardiovascular
disease is of particular interest. Telomere length was found
to be much shorter in endothelial cells from the aorta
compared with those from pulmonary arteries of the same
organ donor, and it was suggested that this could reﬂect
differences in hemodynamic stress to the vessel wall (Chang
and Harley, 1995). Striking cytogenetic abnormalities have
also been described to accumulate in aorta endothelial cells
with age (Aviv et al, 2001). Despite uncertainties about the
replicative or regenerative potential of endothelial cells, it
seems plausible that this capacity will not exceed that of
other somatic (stem) cells. Extrinsic factors, such as smoking,
diabetes, high blood pressure, diet, etc., could result in loss of
endothelial cells or function and trigger cardiovascular dis-
ease in the absence of additional genetic factors that com-
promise the replicative potential of cells such as heritable
telomerase deﬁciencies (Farhat et al, 2008; Wong et al, 2009).
Reduced telomerase levels as well as short telomeres are
expected to compromise the number as well as the replicative
potential of stem cells that remain in speciﬁc tissues after
extrinsic or intrinsic damage from the environment.
Alternatively, disease could be triggered by additional genetic
factors. For example, cell-speciﬁc turnover could be increased
by a speciﬁc genetic defect or a polymorphic trait that
increases the likelihood of cell death in response to injury.
Presumably, such genetic co-factors can be distinguished
from environmental co-factors by careful studies of both
environmental exposure as well as the genotype of a given
patient relative to family members that are not affected or
that display other disease manifestations.
Finally, it seems possible that disease manifestations of
human telomerase disorders are the result of stochastic telo-
mere loss events at individual telomeres during development.
Telomere repeats are lost not only as a result of the ‘end-
replication problem’, but also as a result of sporadic ‘trunca-
tion’ events that could have several different causes
(Lansdorp, 2005). Recently, it was found that within the
haematopoietic system the most primitive haematopoietic
cells have fewer abruptly shortened telomeres compared
with more differentiated cells (Hills et al, 2009). The level of
telomerase could be important when more than a few spora-
dic telomere loss events occur or accumulate in a cell at any
given time (Aubert and Lansdorp, 2008). In cells with overall
shorter telomeres and lower telomerase levels to start with,
cell death events could occur more frequently during normal
development. Both the number and the replicative potential of
remaining tissue-speciﬁc stem cells could be compromised
stochastically depending on when cell death occurred during
development and whether remaining cells had to go through
extra divisions to make up for the loss of cells. The distinction
between environmental, genetic and stochastic reasons for the
variable clinical presentation of patients with telomerase
disorders is a major research challenge. This challenge is
augmented further by the distinct possibility that the speciﬁc
disease manifestation in an individual patient results from a
combination of these and other factors.
Telomere defects and cancer predisposition
Telomerase is upregulated in a majority of human cancers
(Kim et al, 1994; Cao et al, 2008). This upregulation is
believed to be required to allow malignant cells to divide
after genetic rearrangements enabled by telomere dysfunc-
tion. In view of the telomerase requirement in (late stage)
cancer growth, the recent ﬁnding that heritable defects
appear to predispose for the development of acute myeloid
leukaemia seems perhaps counterintuitive (Calado et al,
2009). However, patients with DC or bone marrow failure
resulting from mutations in telomerase genes often develop
leukaemia or other types of cancer (Alter et al, 2009).
Leukaemia and other malignancies are also well-known
complications of high-dose chemotherapy regimens and
MDS. Most likely, the loss of stem cells by telomere dysfunc-
tion or treatment creates an environment in which abnormal
cells can ﬂourish. This could reﬂect persistent feedback
signals stimulating stem cell proliferation from the microen-
vironment. With many stem cells present, such stimulation is
expected to occur only transiently, whereas with few or no
normal stem cells responding, such stimulatory signals could

persist and stimulate the growth of abnormal cells (e.g. cells
with defective DNA damage responses). The malignant pro-
gression of such abnormal cells could be further facilitated by
mutations induced by earlier treatment. In other words,
normal stem cell numbers could indirectly suppress malig-
nant transformation of cells, whereas loss of stem cells could
predispose for malignant transformation. The difﬁculties
related to the identiﬁcation of stem cells in vivo that were
discussed above greatly complicate studies on the role of the
number of stem cells in tumour development. However, it
seems possible that a decline in the number of tissue-speciﬁc
stem cells could contribute to the exponential increase in
tumour development with age. Such a relationship is
suggested by the paradoxical relationship between hypo-
and hyperproliferative disorders. For example, Calado et al,
reported in a recent paper that heritable hypomorphic muta-
tions in the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene predispose
for acute myeloid leukaemia (Calado et al, 2009). In this
study of AML patients (n ¼ 594), a common variant of the
telomerase reverse transcriptase gene hTERT, A1062T, was
present three times more frequently in patients than in
controls (n ¼ 1110, P ¼ 0.0009). The mutant telomerase allele
was found to decrease the enzymatic activity of telomerase
by B50% in the TRAP telomerase assay (Calado et al, 2009).
However, the A1062T hTERT variant did not appear to
compromise telomerase activity in another study (Alder
et al, 2008), and the precise functional consequences of
A1062T expression in human (stem) cells remain to be
clariﬁed. As in most patients only one TERT allele was
affected, telomerase activity in the stem cells of these patients
is expected to be around 75% of normal levels. How reduced
telomerase levels in these patients relate to the development
of AML is not clear. One possibility is that telomeres were on
average shorter at birth and that shorter telomeres limited
normal stem cell proliferation with selection of abnormal
cells as discussed above. Second, it is possible that full
telomerase levels are critical in HSCs to maintain telomere
function of critically short telomeres. Even a slight reduction
in telomerase levels could increase the probability of cell
death after, for example, oxidative damage to telomeric DNA
in stem cells. Telomeres in the most primitive haematopoietic
cells were found to have the lowest frequency of abruptly
shortened telomeres in the haematopoietic system (Hills et al,
2009) and oxidative damage is a major cause of telomere
attrition (von Zglinicki, 2002).
Two recent studies have suggested that risk of developing
lung cancer is associated with genetic markers (SNP’s) that
map to the TERT locus (McKay et al, 2008; Wang et al, 2008).
These results were conﬁrmed in a large SNP study, which
also looked at a variety of other tumours (Rafnar et al, 2009).
In this large study of over 30 000 cancer cases and 45 000
controls, a signiﬁcant association of SNP rs401681[C] within
the TERT locus on chromosome 5p15.33 was found with
basal cell carcinoma, lung cancer and cancer of the urinary
bladder, prostate and cervix. Interestingly, the same SNP
seems to confer protection against cutaneous melanoma,
and the cancers that are associated with this SNP all have a
strong environmental component to their risk. Although the
precise role of genetic variation within the TERT locus
remains to be elucidated, it is tempting to speculate that
this SNP is linked to hypomorphic TERT alleles similar to the
A1062T variant that was found to be more frequently in
patients with AML than normal controls.
Concluding remarks
Recent studies have put telomerase and telomere research
square at the centre of cancer research. Not only is ampliﬁca-
tion of the hTERT gene one of the most common genetic
abnormalities in lung adenocarcinoma, one of the most
common human cancers (Weir et al, 2007; Kang et al,
2008), it now is becoming clear that SNP’s within the TERT
locus are among the most reproducible risk factors for the
development of different types of cancer (McKay et al, 2008;
Wang et al, 2008; Rafnar et al, 2009). The ﬁnding that
hypomorphic TERT mutations increase the risk for the devel-
opment of acute myeloid leukaemia (Calado et al, 2009),
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (Hills and Lansdorp, NYAS in
press) and probably other cancers, together with the in-
creased risk for leukaemia development associated with
bone marrow failure in AA, MDS and DC, strongly implicates
stem cell failure and reduced stem cell numbers as risk
factors for tumour development. More direct measures of
stem cell numbers in vivo are needed to examine the relation-
ship between stem cell numbers and tumour development in
patients with defective telomere maintenance as well as in
normal individuals as a function of age. Measurements of the
average telomere length as well as the length at individual
chromosome ends in speciﬁc cells and tissues are expected to
provide valuable information about the involvement of telo-
meres in normal ageing and tumour biology.
