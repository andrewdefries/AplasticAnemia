A systemic graft-vs.-host reaction (GVHR) 1 can give rise to a variety of
pathological symptoms. One of the possible outcomes is acute GVH disease
(GVHD). After a brief initial phase of lymphoid stimulation (1-3), 2 acute GVHD
rapidly produces suppressive pathological symptoms, such as pancytopenia ac-
companied by aplastic anemia and hypogammaglobulinemia (1-7). 2 A different
possible consequence of the GVHR consists of long-term stimulatory pathological
symptoms and is referred to as chronic GVHD (8). This type of GVHD comprises
a persistent lymphoid hyperplasia (I-3, 6, 9),2 hypergammaglobulinemia (1, 7,
9, 10), and the formation of autoantibodies and pathological lesions reminiscent
of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other types of vascular collagen disease
(1-3, 7-10). Either type of GVHD can be experimentally induced by injecting
parental strain T lymphocytes into nonirradiated F1 hybrid mice. Which type of
GVHD will develop in these GVH F1 mice appears to depend on the subset of
donor T cells activated in them (2, 3, 7, 11).2 The stimulatory GVH symptoms
can be induced by Lyt-l+2--alloreactive donor T helper (Th) cells, whereas
induction of the suppressive GVH symptoms requires both alloreactive donor
Th and T suppressor (Ts) cells (3, 11).2 The alloactivated donor Ts cells, which
might act by the release of antimitotic factor(s), appear to be the final effector

cells causing the pancytopenia of acute GVHD, which, in turn, may terminate as
lethal GVHD (7).2
In our preceding paper, 2 we analyzed the cellular events leading to acute
GVHD after the injection into nonirradiated (C57BL/10 × DBA/2)Fz (BDFI)
recipients of 10s unseparated spleen cells (SpC) obtained from C57BL/10 (B10)
donors. After a brief initial activation of Lyt-1 +2- donor Th cells, beginning in
week 2, an activation of F~-specific Lyt-2+ donor Ts cells took place. The
occurrence of these alloreactive Ts cells was confined to acute GVHD, in time
and in the donor-host combinations being compared. In those of the B 10-injected
BDF~ mice that did not succumb to acute GVHD but instead recovered from it,
a gradual loss of donor Ts cells took place. This gradual disappearance of
alloreactive donor Ts cells was paralleled in time by a decrease of the pancyto-
penia of acute GVHD. By day 60, the GVH F1 mice showed hematopoietic
recovery and exhibited at moderate lymphoid stimulation as well as perivascular
and periductal lymphoid infiltrations in liver and salivary glands. 2 We termed
this form of chronic GVHD secondary (2 °) chronic GVHD to distinguish it from
1° chronic GVHD, which is not preceded by acute GVHD but directly results in
a full-blown SLE-like disease (8).~
In the present investigation, we used the B 10 ~ BDF~ model to further analyze
the transition from acute GVHD to 2 ° chronic GVHD. We found that most of
the BDF~ recipient mice that recovered from acute GVHD were repopulated by
lympho-hematopoietic cells of donor (B 10) origin. Such mice were termed GVH
F~ chimeras to distinguish them from irradiation chimeras. The takeover in
GVH F~ chimeras of the lympho-hematopoietic tissue by donor cells was found
to be mediated by the Lyt-2+-alloreactive donor Ts cells, which appear to be
relatively short-lived. In contrast, donor Th cells alloactivated in the F~ host
were long-lived; they appeared to mediate the symptoms of 2 ° chronic GVHD.
Materials and Methods
Mice. C57BL/10ScSn (B10) (H-2b/b, Ig-lbm), B10.D2n (H-2d/~),BDFI (H-2b/d,Ig-lb/C),
and B10 x B10.BR)F~ (H-2b/k)mice were purchased from Olac 1976 Ltd., Bicester, Oxon,
England). BALB/c (H-2am) and BI0.AKM (H-2m/m)mice were obtained from the Neth-
erlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam. Female mice were used throughout; they were 6-
10 wk old unless mentioned otherwise.
Preparatio~ of Donor Cells. Single-cell suspensions of donor SpC, lymph node cells
(LNC), and bone marrow cells (BMC) were prepared as described (12).
Induction of the GVHR. Unless mentioned otherwise, the GVHR was induced by
intravenous injection of 10s live B10 SpC into adult, nonirradiated BDF1 (GVH F~) mice.
T3'pi~g of Serum Ig-I Allot~,pes. The procedure of preparing anti-lg-1 allotype serum
has been described elsewhere (13). Briefly, mice were immunized with pertussis vaccine
to provide antipertussis IgG. At weekly intervals, B10 (Ig-1b/b) pertussis/antipertussis
agglutinates were injected subcutaneously into DBA/2 (Ig-1c/c)mice, and vice versa. The
serum Ig-1 allotypes of individual GVH F~mice were determined by immunoprecipitation
in agar gel, by applying the anti-Ig-1 band -Ig-V allotype sera at constant dilutions of 1:5
and 1:3, respectively. At these dilutions of the antiallotype sera, equal endpoint titers
(1:10) of Ig-Iband Ig-1cantigen were found in the sera of normal BDF1 (N Fl) mice. The
anti-Ig-1 c serum could still detect the Ig-1c antigen provided by one part of N Fl serum
admixed to nine parts of B10 serum. The sera obtained from GVH F~ mice were assayed
undiluted.
Histocompatibilit~, Typing. An anti-H-2b serum was prepared in BI0.D2 mice, and an
510 SPLIT TOLERANCE OF DONOR T CELLS 1N 2° CHRONIC GVHD
anti-H-2a serum was prepared in B10 mice, by injecting lymphoid cells from B10 and
B10.D2, respectively. Cells of GVH F1 mice were typed by a complement (C)-dependent
cytotoxicity assay, and the results were expressed as a cytotoxic index (12). Histocompat-
ibility typing of erythrocytes was performed by an indirect Coombs' test by applying the
two antisera mentioned above and a rabbit anti-mouse IgG serum (cat. code OTPN;
Behring Werke AG, Marburg/Lahn, Federal Republic of Germany), diluted 1:100.
Preparation of T Cell-depletedSpC (B cells). B cells were prepared by incubating SpC
with monoclonal anti-Thy-l.2 (clone F7D5; Olac 1976 Ltd.) and C (12). The percentages
of live T lymphocytes after treatmentwith anti-Thy-1.2 and C were determined by indirect
immunofluorescence by using a rabbit anti-mouse brain serum in combination with
fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (F2190; Dakopatts, Copenhagen, Den-
mark); the percentage ofT cells spared by the anti-Thy-l.2 treatment did not exceed 2%.
PreparationofNylon-Wool-pur~ed T Cells. T ceil-enriched populations (T cells) were
prepared by passing SpC, or SpC plus LNC, through nylon wool (14).
Anti-Lyt Treatment. Cell suspensions depleted of Lyt subsets were prepared as described
elsewhere (11). Briefly, SpC were treated twice with either a 1:1,000 diluted mouse
monoclonal anti-Lyt-l.2 (IgG2b) (NEI-017; New England Nuclear, Boston, MA) and C
or a I:I,000 diluted mouse monoclonal anti-Lyt-2.2 (IgM) (NEI-006; New England
Nuclear) and C. After the cells were treated with either normal mouse serum (NMS) plus
C, anti-Lyt-2.2 plus C, or anti-Lyt-l.2 plus C, live T cells comprised 35, 20, and 4%,
respectively, of the total number of live SpC. The ability and/or inability of the respective
cell populations to induce allohelp and/or allosuppression in vitro and in vivo has been
described elsewhere (11). The term Lyt-l-2÷ cells is an operational one, as defined by
treatment with anti-Lyt-l.2 plus C; it does not preclude the possible existence of a low
concentration of Lyt-l.2 on the so-called Lyt-l-2+ cells.
Primary, Anti-Sheep Erythrocyte (SE) Response In Vitro. Allohelper and allosuppressor
activities of GVH FI SpC were assayed as described by Pickel and Hoffman (15), with
some modifications.~Briefly, a constant number of 5 × 106 B cells or SpC obtained from
N F~ mice or control mice were co-cuhured with increasing numbers of SpC or T cells
obtained from GVH F~ mice; 5 × 105 SE were added as the antigen. On day 4, the direct
plaque-forming cell (PFC) responses of triplicate cultures were determined by Jerne
plaque assay.
Mixed LymphocyteReactions(MLR). MLR were performed as described elsewhere (16).
Briefly, MLR were set up in four replicate cultures with 5 × 105 responder and 7.5 × 105
1,500 rad-irradiated stimulator cells per well. The MLR were incubated for 4 d, and
[SH]thymidine was present during the last 4 h.
Cell-mediatedLymphocvtotoxicit~,Assay (CML). The CML activity of SpC was determined
as described (12). Briefly, responder cells (12 × 106) were incubated for 5 d together with
3,300 rad-irradiated stimulator cells (12 × 106) in 5 ml of culture medium. The CML
activity of the cultures was measured in a 4-h chromium-release assay using concanavalin
A blasts as target cells. Results are expressed as lytic units (LU) per culture (17), one LU
being equal to the number of responder cells that gives 25% specific lysis of the target
cell population.
Popliteal Lymph Node (PLN) Assay. The PLN assay was performed as described (18).
On day 10 after the injection of donor SpC into one hind footpad of a nonirradiated
recipient mouse, both PLN were removed and weighed. The strength of the reactive
PLN enlargement was calculated as the PLN index, being the ratio of the lymph node
weight from the injected side over that from the noninjected side. For the measurement
of B cell stimulation in a PLN, cell suspensions were prepared from it and the total
number of IgM- and IgG-producing cells per 105 PLN cells was determined by protein A
PFC assay.
Protein A PFC Assay. This assay was performed as described elsewhere (19).
Assayfor the Mortalih, Induced by Transferred GVH F~ SpC. At the age of ~3 mo, the
prospective recipient mice were given a lethal 950 rad whole-body irradiation, delivered
by 662 kV gamma rays emitted from a ~VCs source at a dose of 375 rad/min. Within 3 h
after irradiation, the mice were injected intravenously with the donor cells indicated. On
PALS, GLEICHMANN, AND GLEICHMANN 511
days 1-7 after irradiation, the mice received drinking water that contained polymyxin B
(I 2,500 U/liter) and oxytetracycline (100 mg/liter). Mice were inspected twice a week for
symptoms of acute GVHD or death.
Irradiation Chimeras. Untreated BDF1 mice, ~3 mo old, were submitted to 950 tad
whole-body irradiation and given antibiotics as described above. The mice were then
injected with 107 live B10 BMC that had been treated with monoclonal anti-Thy-l.2 and
C. No deaths due to GVHD were observed in the recipients. About 3 mo after the
repopulation, the FI recipients were tested by histocompatibility typing. More than 95%
of their SpC were found to be of B10 origin; these irradiation chimeras were used for
further studies.
Results
Complete Lympho-hematopoietic Repopulation of Nonirradiated BDFI Recipients by
BIO SpC. A systemic GVHR was induced in groups of BDF1 recipient mice by
injecting 108 B 10 SpC. As reported earlier (2, 12), 2 at 2-6 wk after the induction
of GVHR, the GVH F~ mice invariably showed symptoms of acute GVHD,
including weight loss, cellular depletion of the lympho-hematopoietic tissue, and
anemia. The percentage of GVH FI that succumbed to acute GVHD, however,
varied from experiment to experiment, the mortality ranging from 20 to 80%.
The survivors of acute GVHD recovered and no longer showed clinical symptoms
of GVHD.
In three groups of GVH F~ mice that had survived for >100 d, the presence
of donor cell chimerism was assayed. This was done by determining the Ig
allotype(s) present in the sera of the GVH FI mice and typing their erythrocytes
for the presence of H-2 b and H-2 a antigens. In 70-80% of the GVH FI mice
tested (Table I), neither the host-derived Ig-1 ¢ allotypic markers in the serum
nor the H-2 d alioantigens on the erythrocytes were detectable. In contrast, the
Ig-1 b allotype and H-2 b antigens, which are common to both host and donor,
were readily detectable in all these GVH FI mice (Table I). These findings
indicate that most of the GVH F~ mice that had recovered from acute GVHD
were repopulated by lympho-hematopoietic cells of donor origin. In a group of

GVH F, mice that were autopsied at day 100 after the induction of GVHR,
repopulation was confirmed by histocompatibility typing of their SpC (Table II).
From the same GVH F~ mice, we also typed cell suspensions consisting of either
BMC, thymus cells, or LNC: whereas the cytotoxic indices obtained after treat-
ment with the host-specific anti-H-2 d serum and C were 3, 1, and 2, respectively,
those obtained with anti-H-2 b serum and C were 98, 94, and 97.
H-2 typing of the spleens of GVH F~ mice killed at regular intervals showed
that host cells had almost completely disappeared from their spleens as early as
day 14 after induction of GVHR (Table II). The rapid disappearance of the
host-derived Ig-I c allotype from the sera of another group of GVH F1 mice
(Table II) agrees with this observation. Once established, the repopulation of
GVH F1 mice was a stable condition in that it lasted for at least 200 d (Table I).
Lympho-hematopoietie Repoputatio~ of Nonirradiated BDFI Recipients Is Mediated by
Non-Lyt-separated Alloreactive T Cells. Next, we analyzed the cellular require-
ments of lympho-hematopoietic takeover. As expected, we found that the injec-
tion of 5 x 10v B10 LNC, a population deficient in hematopoietic stem cells,
failed to repopulate, but caused lethal GVHD (LGVHD) in 70% of the BDF1
recipients. Whereas GVH mortality in the F, recipients was significantly reduced
by the addition of B10 BMC as a source of stem cells to the inoculum of B10
LNC, this was not the case when BMC from BDF~ mice were added to B10 LNC
(data not shown). In the next experiment, we demonstrated that lympho-hema-
topoietic repopulation was mediated by unseparated alloreactive B10 T cells
(Table III). First, three groups of BDF~ mice were injected with 108 live cells of
one of the following sources: (a) B10 SpC, pretreated with NMS and C, (b) B10
SpC, pretreated with anti-Thy-1.2 and C, or (c) SpC obtained from B10 ~ BDF1
irradiation chimeras. The SpC obtained from irradiation chimeras were shown
to be specifically tolerant of BDFl antigens in both MLR (Table IV) and
allogeneic T-B cell cooperation (Fig. 1). At about day 100 after the induction of
GVHR, we determined whether the host-specific Ig-1~allotype was still present
in sera from the recipients. In contrast to B10 SpC pretreated with N MS, neither
anti-Thy-l.2-pretreated B10 SpC nor B10 SpC that were tolerant of BDFI
recipients were able to cause the lympho-hematopoietic repopulation (Table III).

To determine which T cell subpopulations were involved, we then injected
groups of BDF1 recipients with cells from B10 SpC that had been pretreated
with either anti-Lyt-l.2 and C or anti-Lyt-2.2 and C. Neither anti-Lyt-l.2- nor
anti-Lyt-2.2-pretreated B 10 SpC were able to repopulate the F1 recipients (Table
III). Thus, lympho-hematopoietic repopulation of nonirradiated BDFI mice
required inocula containing alloreactive B10 T cells that had not been separated
into Lyt subsets and, in addition, included syngeneic (B10) stem cells.
Persistence in Long-term GVH F I Chimeras of F ~-specificDonor Th Cells. Next, we
analyzed the functional properties of cells derived from the long-term GVH F1
chimeras. Unless indicated otherwise, the experiments described in this section
and all subsequent sections were performed with SpC that were obtained from
GVH FI chimeras killed at day 100-150 after the induction of GVHR. These
SpC consisted of >95% B 10 donor cells. First, we studied whether B10 Th cells,
obtained from GVH F1 chimeras, could still react against host-type alloantigens.

This was done by measuring the effects of SpC from GVH F~ chimeras on the
primary anti-SE response, in vitro, of B cells syngeneic either to the host (BDF~)
or to the GVH donor (B10). Graded numbers of SpC obtained from GVH FI
chimeras, normal B10 or BDF~ mice, or B10 ---) F~ irradiation chimeras were
added to SE-stimulated B cell cultures. The results of such an experiment are
shown in Fig. 1; they are representative of six identical experiments, each of
which was done using SpC from an individual GVH F~ chimera. Essentially
similar results were obtained when nylon-wool-purified T cells instead of SpC
were used (data not shown). The addition of low numbers of normal B10 SpC
to semiailogeneic BDF~ B cells led to a positive allogeneic effect (Fig. 1A), which
is known to be caused by Lyt-l+2--alloreactive Th cells (20, 21). When the
number of normal B10 SpC was further increased, a negative allogeneic effect
occurred, caused by Lyt-2÷-alloreactive Ts cells (20, 21). The addition of low
numbers of SpC obtained from GVH F1 chimeras to the BDF~ B cells led, as did
the addition of normal B10 SpC, to a positive aliogeneic effect. However, no
negative allogeneic effect ensued after the addition of high numbers of SpC
from the GVH F~ chimeras. These findings indicate that host-specific donor Th
ceils were still present in the spleens of long-term GVH F~ chimeras, whereas
alloreactive Ts cells were no longer detectable. The loss of alloreactive Ts cell
activity from the spleens of GVH F~ chimeras (day 100) was also apparent in the
observation that they failed to suppress, but instead slightly stimulated, the anti-
SE PFC response of N F~ SpC (Fig. 2). For comparison, the suppressive effects
resulting from co-culture of N F~ SpC and GVH F~ SpC obtained at days 10 and
38 after the induction of GVHR are shown (Fig. 2).

respond in MLR and CML to host or third-party ailoantigens. GVH F~ chimera
cells, obtained at day 100 after the induction of GVHR, responded to host-type
and third-party alloantigens with about equal strength (Table IV). At 210 d after
the induction of GVHR, GVH F~ chimera cells still showed a significant, albeit
reduced, response against host-type alloantigens (Table IV). Thus, donor T cells,
able to proliferate in response to host-type alloantigens, did persist in GVH F~
chimeras for at least 6 mo. In marked contrast, the T cells obtained from these
long-term GVH Fa chimeras showed hardly any CML activity after restimulation
with irradiated host-type (BDFI) cells (Table V). Out of the total of seven
individually tested GVH F~ chimeras, five showed no detectable CML activity at
all, and two others showed only a very weak CML activity. As is evident from
Table V, the lack of CML activity against host-type alloantigens was specific.
SpC obtained from GVH F~ chimeras did not suppress the anti-BDFa CML
response of N B10 SpC (Table V). This indicates that a lack of cytotoxic T cell
precursors rather than the presence of suppressor cells was responsible for the
specific inability of GVH Fl chimeras to generate T killer (Tk) cells against host-
type alloantigens.
T Cells ofBlO --~ F1 Irradiation Chimeras Are Completely Tolerant of the Host. We
then asked whether the type of split tolerance found in long-term GVH F~
chimeras also existed in irradiation chimeras, as stated by Sprent et al. (22).
Evidently, it did not, however, because SpC obtained from irradiation chimeras
showed neither allohelper (Fig. 1) nor proliferative activity (Table IV) in response

I Results of two individual experiments.
GVH Reactiviv of Adoptively Tra~sferred SpC Obtai~ed from Long-term GVH FI
Chimeras. Having demonstrated the split tolerance of GVH chimera cells in
vitro, we then examined their ability to react against host alloantigens in two
GVH assays in vivo, the PLN assay and the GVH mortality assay. First, we asked
whether the B10 T cells present in GVH chimeras were still able to cause PLN
enlargement as well as B cell activation when confronted with BDF~ alloantigens.
Both types of reactivity were indeed found. Moreover, both the PLN enlarge-
ment and the B cell activation were caused by cells reacting specifically against
the DBA/2 part of the BDFl recipients (Table VI). More than 95% of the total
Ig secretion induced in the PLN was of the IgG isotype.
Then we tested the ability of GVH F~ chimera SpC to induce mortality in
lethally irradiated BDF1 recipients. To avoid mortality due to a hypothetical lack
of hematopoietic stem cells in the donor cell inoculum, the SpC obtained from
tile GVH F~ chimeras were mixed with BMC from the same mice. The cell
suspensions thus obtained did not contain detectable numbers of BDFI cells,
whereas the percentage of T cells in the cell mixture was similar to that in a
mixture prepared from normal B10 Spc plus BMC. The injection of 30 X 106
GVH F~ chimera cells into 950 tad-irradiated BDF1 recipients did not lead to a
significant incidence of LGVHD; 9 out of l0 recipients survived for >80 d
(Table VII, group 4) without showing symptoms of secondary disease. At day 80
after the cell transfer, the sera of these secondary BDF~ recipients contained
only the Ig-1 b allotype, indicating that they were repopulated by donor (B10)
cells. As expected, all BDF1 recipients of normal B10 SpC died within 40 d after
the induction of GVHD (Table VII, group 1). The inability of GVH F~ chimera
cells to induce GVH mortality in irradiated BDF~ recipients was specific, since
(B10 X B10.BR)FI recipients all succumbed within 30 d after the injection of
GVH F~ chimera cells (Table VII, group 5). The mixture of GVH Fl SpC with
BI0 SpC did not affect the ability of the latter cells to induce LGVHD in BDFI

recipients (Table VII, group 7). Thus, a lack of relevant alloreactive T cells,
rather than the presence of suppressor cells, was responsible for the specific
inability of the SpC obtained from GVH F~ chimeras to induce GVH mortality
in lethally irradiated BDF1 recipients.
Discussion
Recent papers from this laboratory have reported that SLE-like GVHD in
nonirradiated F~ mice is caused by Lyt-l+-2- donor Th cells that react against
class II (I-A/I-E) alloantigens of the host (3, 11, 23). Induction of acute GVHD,
by contrast, required unseparated donor T cells (11). In acute GVHD, apparently
there is a sequential alloactivation consisting of first (week 1) class II-reactive
Lyt-l+2- donor cells that subsequently (weeks 2 to 6) induce class I (K/D)-reactive
Lyt-l+2+ and Lyt-l-2 + allosuppressor effector cells (3, 11, 24, 25).2 When
unseparated SpC of the donor BI0 were injected into fully H-2-different BDF1
mice, the following three stages of GVHR were distinguished: (a) In week 1,
alloactivated donor Th cells predominated; (b) from weeks 2 to 6, donor Ts cells
prevailed and caused acute GVHD; and (c) in those GVH F1 mice that survived
that stage of acute GVHD, alloreactive donor Ts cells were no longer detectable
(Fig. 2) and the stimulatory pathological symptoms of 2° chronic GVHD ap-
peared (8).2 In the present investigation, we extended the functional analysis of
B10 donor T cells obtained from F~ recipients with 2 ° chronic GVHD.

Repopulation ofF1 Recipients by Lympho-hematopoietic Donor Cells. Several groups
of investigators have observed that nonirradiated H-2-different F1 mice undergo-
ing GVHR may be repopulated by parental SpC (26-28). The recent observation
(2) that such a repopulation took place in parent ~ Fl combinations undergoing
acute GVHD, but not as readily in GVH F1 mice developing a chronic lupus-like
GVHD, prompted us to further analyze the relationship between acute GVHD
and lympho-hematopoietic repopulation. A likely possibility was that the Lyt-
1+2+ and Lyt-l-2 + Frspecific donor Ts cells (24, 25, 29), 2 whose presence in
GVH F1 mice shortly preceded and coincided with the pancytopenia of acute
GVHDfl did indeed mediate the depletion of lympho-hematopoietic host cells.
Alternatively, the appearance of the donor Ts cells might be an epiphenomenon
secondary to the disappearance of lympho-hematopoietic host cells, a situation
analogous to the secondary appearance of Ig allotype-specific Ts cells observed
after the preceding deprivation of that allotype (30). Our results favor the former
possibility. Repopulation was only achieved by the injection into BDF1 recipients
of unseparated B 10 SpC, but not of either Lyt-1+2- or Lyt-1-2+ B 10 SpC alone.
Moreover, the unseparated B 10 T cells required for repopulation had to be able
PALS, GLEICHMANN, AND GLEICHMANN 519
to react towards the host (Table III). Thus, the complete lympho-hematopoietic
repopulation described in the present paper appears to be mediated by the same
alloactivated donor Ts cells that cause acute GVHD and the pancytopenia that
accompany it (2, 3, 7, 11).2
Split Tolerance Towards Host Alloantigens in Survivors of Acute GVHD. Up till
now, only limited studies on the anti-F~ reactivity of donor T cells present in
nonirradiated GVH Fl chimeras have been performed (27, 28). We found that
Fl-specific donor Ts cells (Fig. 1) and Tk cells (Table V) were not at all, or were
hardly any longer detectable in the spleens of long-term GVH F~ chimeras. In
marked contrast, Fi-specific donor Th cells (Fig. 1), as well as MLR-reactive
donor T cells (Table IV), were readily recovered from the GVH F~ chimeras
until at least 5 mo after the induction of GVHR. This split tolerance of the B10
T cells recovered from long-term GVH chimeras was also demonstrable in vivo:
whereas the B10 T cells obtained from GVH chimeras had specifically lost their
capacity to induce LGVHD in secondary BDFI recipients (Table VII), they were
still able to induce F~-specific PLN enlargement and B cell activation (Table VI).
These findings conform to other observations showing that PLN enlargement
(S. T. Pals, unpublished observation) and B cell activation in vivo (3, 11, 23) can
be initiated by alioreactive Th cells alone. In contrast, acute GVHD requires a
sequential activation of alioreactive Th and Ts ceils (3, 11).2 An interpretation
in immunogenetic terms of the observed split tolerance strongly suggests that
ailoreactivities, such as CML (31-33), allosuppression (3, 20, 21), and acute
GVHD (3), in which class I (K/D) antigens provide the main targets, were
seriously impaired in the donor T cells that were recovered from long-term
GVH F~ chimeras. By contrast, alloreactivities, such as MLR (32-34), allohelp
(3, 20, 21, 23), and B cell activation (3), that are mainly directed against class II
alloantigens, remained unimpaired over several months. According to this inter-
pretation, the stimulatory phenomena observed in 2 ° chronic GVHD (2)2 were
caused by the long-lived donor Th cells that must have reacted against a minor
population of persisting Fa cells carrying class II alloantigens. Another, not
mutually exclusive, explanation for the stimulatory pathological phenomena in
2 ° chronic GVHD might be that late-acting donor Th cells reacted to class I
alloantigens, or yet other antigens, that they recognized in association with
syngeneic (donor) class II structures (35).
The same kind of split tolerance that we observed here in long-term GVH F~
chimeras was reported by Sprent et al. (22) in lethally irradiated F~ mice that
had been reconstituted with parental BMC pretreated with anti-Thy-l.2 and C.
In contrast, we found no evidence for the presence of anti-host-reactive T cells
in such irradiation chimeras (Fig. 1, Table IV). Consistent with our observation,
complete tolerance of donor T cells towards the host has also been described in
fully allogeneic irradiation chimeras (36). The discrepancy between our findings
and those of Krown et al. (36) on the one hand, and those of Sprent et al. (22)
on the other, might lie in a failure of the latter investigators to remove all the
mature T cells from the donor BMC by the conventional anti-Thy 1.2 they used.
Our findings and those of Krown et ai. (36) both fit the concept that radioresistant
host cells determine the self-specificity of immature donor T cells differentiating
in an allogeneic host (37, 38). Correspondingly, our findings indicate that the
520 SPLIT TOLERANCE OF DONOR T CELLS IN 2 ° CHRONIC GVHD
allohelper T cells recovered from the long-term GVH F~ chimeras were derived
from the mature donor T cells injected for the induction of GVHR.
To explain the development of split tolerance of donor T cells in GVH
chimeras, at least three possibilities had to be considered: (a) There might have
been an active suppression of the anti-F~-reactive Ts/Tk clones. Although it has
been observed that T cells obtained from radiation chimeras can specifically
suppress the anti-host reactivity of donor T cells (39, 40), there was no evidence
for such a mechanism in our GVH F1 chimeras (Table V and VII), (b) the
sequential alloactivation in acute GVHD first of donor Th and then of Ts cells
follows the rules of the T cell feedback circuit (41). Conceivably, the activation
of donor Ts cells might have been quenched because of a reduction of T helper/
inducer activity which, in turn, resulted from a numerical decrease in GVH F1
chimeras of stimulatory (class II) alloantigens. However, when the B10 cells that
were recovered from long-term GVH F~ chimeras were reexposed to BDF1
stimulator cells, either in vitro or in vivo, no reactivation of Ts/Tk cells ensued,
although vigorous allohelper and MLR responses were obtained. (c) The early
loss of Ts/Tk cell activity may be due to a rather short lifespan of these cells.
This possibility is supported by other observations (42, 43; E. K61sch, personal
communication) that the time periods during which activated Ts cells remained
detectable were relatively short, whereas the longevity of activated Th cells is
well established (44).
Whatever the mechanism of the observed split tolerance may be, our findings
clearly indicate that anti-host-reactive donor Th cells can persist in the host for
at least 6 mo. These findings challenge the role of donor T cells in chronic
GVHD as proposed by Elkins (45). He argues that the role of donor T cells in
chronic GVHD might be merely to trigger, during the stage of acute GVHD, a
number of pathogenic effects, such as immunosuppression, infection, and acti-
vation of latent viruses. These secondary GVH effects would then, independently
of donor T cells, cause the symptoms of chornic GVHD. Although we are aware
of these GVH effects, our findings suggest that long-lived alloreactive donor Th
cells can directly cause and maintain most of the stimulatory pathological symp-
toms of 2 ° chronic GVHD. In this context, it is noteworthy that cells obtained
from human patients with chronic GVHD, but not those without GVHD,
responded to HLA-identical, cryopreserved host cells in an MLR (39, 46).
Summary
We studied the alloreactive properties of donor T cells obtained from F~ mice
that had recovered from the allosuppression of acute graft-vs.-host disease
(GVHD) and showed mild symptoms of chronic GVHD, i.e., so-called secondary
chronic GVHD. To this end, we used (B10 x DBA/2)F1 mice that had been
injected with 108 B10 spleen cells 100-150 d previously. Such GVH F~ mice
were repopulated by lympho-hematopoietic cells of donor (B10) origin, which
exhibited split tolerance towards the host: Whereas Fl-specific donor T helper
(Th) cells as well as T cells proliferating in the mixed lymphocyte reaction were
readily demonstrable, Fl-specific T suppressor (Ts) and T killer (Tk) cells were
not, or were hardly, detectable; responses against third-party alloantigens were
normal. Upon adoptive transfer to nonirradiated secondary recipients, the B10
PALS, GLEICHMANN, AND GLEICHMANN 521
ceils obtained from the repopulated GVH FI mice induced F~-specific enlarge-
ment of the draining popliteal lymph node and enhancement of the IgG forma-
tion therein. B10 cells of the same kind were unable, however, to induce lethal
GVHD upon transfer to 950 rad-irradiated secondary (B10 X DBA/2)FI recipi-
ents. We conclude that alloactivated donor Ts/Tk cells disappear from the host
at a relatively early stage of GVHD, i.e., at the end of acute GVHD, presumably
because they are short-lived. By contrast, the longevity of alloactivated donor
Th cells causes the symptoms of secondary chronic GVHD.
