Summary Cyclophosphamide (CP) administration to rats in a single i.p. dose (200mg kg1), while producing
urinary bladder toxicity and 30-40% depression of the hepatic microsomal mixed function oxidase (MFO),
failed to produce any depression of MFO activities in extrahepatic tissues such as lung, kidney and intestine.
Phenobarbital pretreatment of the rats, which is known to enhance hepatic microsomal activation of CP,
protected against CP-induced urinary bladder toxicity and the depression of hepatic MFO activities. This
protection appears to be, at least in part, related to phenobarbital induction of hepatic cytochrome P-450
isozyme(s) that metabolizes CP to a new metabolite tentatively identified as didechlorodihydroxycyclo-
phosphamide.
The microsomal mixed function oxidase system,
principally found in the liver, is involved in the
activation and detoxification of numerous
xenobiotics including carcinogens, drugs and
pesticides, and some endogenous bio-chemicals such
as steroids and fatty acids. During recent years
ample evidence has accumulated to demonstrate the
existence in hepatic microsomes of multiple forms
of cytochrome P-450, the terminal enzyme of the
oxidase system (Guengerich, 1979; Guengerich et
al., 1982). This evidence has resulted from the
application of gel electrophoresis, immunological,
and recombinant DNA techniques in the
investigation of cytochrome P-450 multiplicity in
hepatic microsomes from several species of animals
treated with different types of microsomal enzyme
inducers (Guengerich, 1979; Guengerich et al.,
1982; Fujii-Kuriyama et al., 1982; Mizukami et al.,
1983). Phenobarbital, a commonly used prototype
inducer, has been shown to induce at least four
different forms of cytochrome P-450 in rats with
overlapping but different substrate specificities
(Guengerich 1979; Guengerich et al., 1982).
Phenobarbital treatment has also been reported to
induce cyclophosphamide metabolism in rodents
and humans (Jao et al., 1972; Sladek, 1972; Bagley
et al., 1973).
Cyclophosphamide (CP), an oxazaphosphorine, is
an important drug in the treatment of cancer and
certain diseases of immunological aetiology
(Friedman et al., 1979). It has also found
application in the immunosuppressive preparation

of patients for organ and tissue transplantation
(Santos et al., 1976; Zinke & Woods, 1977;
Friedman et al., 1979).
CP is inactive per se and requires microsomal
mixed function oxidase-mediated metabolism to
activated metabolites capable of binding covalently
to nucleic acids and proteins. The commonly
accepted scheme of CP metabolism involves
intermediate formation of 4-hydroxy-CP which
undergoes ring-opening to form aldophosphamide,
an isomer of 4-hydroxy-CP (Figure 1). Both 4-
hydroxy-CP and aldophosphamide, can be
detoxified by cytosolic oxidases/reductases (Cox et
al., 1975; Hipkens et al., 1981). Alternatively,
aldophosphamide can undergo non-enzymatic ,B
elimination to release acrolein and phosphoramide
mustard. Acrolein is believed to be responsible for
CP-induced haematuria, one of the limiting
toxicities of CP, and phosphoramide mustard has
been assigned the distinction of being the
therapeutically active metabolite of CP and is
believed to be responsible for both the antitumour
activity and immunosuppression (Friedman et al.,
1979; Brock et al., 1979; Cox, 1979; Berrigan et al.,
1982).
During the recent years we have reported that, in
addition to being responsible for haematuria,
acrolein may also denature cytochrome P-450; both
effects are believed to result from the reaction of
the double bond in acrolein with free sulfhydryl
groups in proteins (Gurtoo et al., 1981). While CP
was found to depress various mixed function
oxidase activities of the liver in vivo, effects on
cytochrome P-450-mediated activities in
extrahepatic tissues were not investigated.

one would anticipate some degree of relationship
between this induction and the chemotherapeutic
and toxic effects of CP. We have investigated this
relationship in the rat in the context of the effects
of CP on mixed function oxidase in liver and
extrahepatic tissue and of the ability of CP to
induce haematuria. These investigations have led to
suggestions of the participation of novel
detoxification pathways of CP metabolism
catalyzed by hepatic microsomes from
phenobarbital treated rats.
Materials and methods
Sources of CP and other chemicals needed for
enzyme assays have been detailed earlier (Hipkens
et al., 1981; Gurtoo et al., 1981; Berrigan et al.,
1982).
Animals tissue and enzyme preparation
Male rats (175-225 g) were used in all the studies.
Source and housing details are given elsewhere
(Berrigan et al., 1982). CP was injected i.p. as a
single injection at a dose of 200mg kg-1, and the
rats were killed 4 days later. Microsomes or
15,000g supernatant from liver, kidney, lung and
intestine were isolated as described previously
(Gurtoo & Parker, 1977; Gurtoo et al., 1981;
Berrigan et al., 1982; Porter et al., 1982), and the
protein content was determined by the method of
Lowry et al. (1951), using bovine serum albumin as
the reference standard. Urinary bladders, when
needed, were removed, immersed in 10% buffered
formalin and stored for histopathology conducted
at a later date.
Enzyme assays
Cytochrome P-450 was determined according to the
method of Omura & Sato (1964) using an Aminco
DW-2 spectrophotometer. The calculation of cyto-
chrome P-450 content is based on the extinction
coefficient of 91 mM 1 cm- 1. Aryl hydrocarbon
hydroxylase (AHH) and aminopyrine demethylase
activities were determined by previously described
methods (Gurtoo et al.., 1981; Berrigan et al.,
1982).
Histopathology
Urinary bladders were fixed in Bouin's solution and
sectioned at 5 gm and the sections for microscopic
examination were stained with haematoxylin and
eosin (Berrigan et al., 1982).
Purification of cytochrome P-450
Cytochrome P-450 was purified from the hepatic
EFFECTS OF THE INDUCTION OF CP METABOLISM 69
microsomes of phenobarbital pretreated male rats
by the method of Guengerich & Martin (1980).
Sodium phenobarbital was included in the drinking
water as a 0.1% solution for 7 days prior to the
sacrifice of the animals. The detergent solubilized
hepatic microsomes were subjected to chroma-
tography on octylamino-Sepharose-4B. The cyto-
chrome P-450 band eluted from this column was
subjected to DEAE-cellulose chromatography as
described by Guengerich & Martin (1980).
Although three peaks eluted from this column, only
peak B2 was found to metabolize either
[chloroethyl-3H]CP or [4-14C]CP. The DEAE-
cellulose column fractions forming peak B2 were
pooled, treated with Bio-beads SM-2 (BioRad
Labs., Richmond, CA) to remove the detergent,
concentrated and dialyzed against 10mM Tris-
acetate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1mM EDTA
and 20% glycerol. The purified "Peak B2"
cytochrome P-450 was stored in small aliquots at
- 70°C for up to 6 months without any loss of
activity. The specific activity ranged between 15-
17 nmol cytochrome P-450 mg- 1 protein. NADPH-
Cytochrome P-450 reductase was also purified from
the same batch of solubilized microsomes according
to the method of Guengerich & Martin (1980). The
specific activity of reductase was 57 units mg-1
protein (1 unit =1 jImol cytochrome C
reduced min- 1).
Metabolism of CP
Metabolism of both [chloroethyl-3H]CP and [4-
14C]CP was studied with hepatic microsomes from
untreated, 3-methylcholanthrene treated and
phenobarbital treated rats or with reconstituted
system containing cytochrome P-450 purified from
hepatic microsomes from phenobarbital treated
rats. Sodium phenobarbital was administered either
i.p. as 2 daily injections (40mgkg-1) for 3
consecutive days or in drinking water as 0.1%
solution for 7 days. 3-Methylcholanthrene was
administered i.p. as a single daily injection
(30mgkg-1) for 3 consecutive days. Control rats
received only the vehicle.
Metabolism by hepatic microsomes
Hepatic microsomes, one mg protein, isolated from
control, 3-methylcholanthrene and phenobarbital
treated rats were incubated in the presence or
absence of an NADPH-generating system with
[chloroethyl-3H]-CP or [4-14C]-CP for 15 min as
derived before (Berrigan et al., 1982). At the
termination of the incubation, the mixture was
extracted twice with 3 to 4 volumes of chloroform:
isoamyl alcohol (95:5) and an aliquot was counted
for the quantitation of the polar metabolite
formation.
Metabolism by the purified Cytochrome P-450
Both [chloroethyl-3H]CP and [4-14C]CP were
metabolized in the cytochrome P-450 reconstituted
system. The composition of 1 ml of buffered
incubation mixture was as follows: 10,jg dilauroyl-
phosphatidyl choline (Serdary Research Labs.,
Ontario, Canada), 0.4 units NADPH-cytochrome
P-450 reductase, 0.1 nmole cytochrome P-450,
7.5 jimol MgCl2 and 0.3 umole [chloroethyl-3H]-CP
or [4-14C]-CP. The reaction was started with the
addition of 0.2 pmol NADPH, and at 20 and
40 min the reaction mixture was fortified with
0.1 nmol cytochrome P-450 and 0.2 jmol NADPH.
The reaction was terminated at 60min by freezing
the incubation mixture in dry ice. Depending upon
the need, 10 to 15 tubes containing 1 ml of
incubation mixture were processed.
For metabolite isolation, as required, incubates
were thawed and extracted with chloroform. The
aqueous phase was lyophilized and the residue was
first extracted with chloroform and then with
method. CP metabolites were resolved by silica gel
thin- layer chromatography in several solvent
systems and by HPLC on a partisil PAC column
with acetonitrile: methanol gradient. Radioactivity
was counted in Aquasol (New England Nuclear,
Boston, MA) in a Packard Tri-Carb model 3315
liquid scintillation counter with external standard.
Radiochromatographic scanning of silica gel plates
was performed with a Packard Model 7220/21
Scanner.
Results
Effect of CP on mixedfunction oxidase activities in
extrahepatic tissues
Investigations were carried out to determine the
effects of CP on mixed function oxidase activities in
extrahepatic tissues such as kidney, lung and
intestine. These tissues were analyzed for the
demethylation of aminopyrine and for AHH
activity and the results compared with the hepatic
activities (Table I). While CP caused a depression
of AHH by 37% and aminopyrine demethylase by
30% in the liver, it failed to produce any inhibition
of these activities in lungs, kidneys and intestine.
Instead, CP was found to increase intestinal AHH
activity by about 50%.
Effects ofphenobarbital on CP-induced depression of
mixedfunction oxidase in liver and extrahepatic
tissues
Phenobarbital pretreatment of rats has been
reported to induce CP metabolism (Sladek, 1972;

the observations that CP induces metabolism-
mediated depression of hepatic cytochrome P-450
and the associated activities, including its own
metabolism, it was argued that induction of CP
metabolism should lead to an enhancement in CP-
induced depression of the mixed function oxidase
activities. The result of the studies performed to
investigate this relationship are given in Table II.
In accordance with several other reports
(Conney, 1967), phenobarbital was found to
enhance the microsomal mixed function oxidase
activities; it increased aminopyrine demethylase
activity by 61% and AHH activity by 42%. In
contrast and as expected from previous studies
(Gurtoo et al., 1981; Berrigan et al., 1982), CP
decreased these mixed function oxidase-mediated
activities by 30 and 37%, respectively. However,
when CP was combined with phenobarbital
pretreatment, phenobarbital failed to produce an
enhancement in the depression of these activities;
but, on the other hand, the activities of the CP plus
phenobarbital group were 37% and 20%,
respectively, higher than the control group. Even if
the activities of the CP plus phenobarbital group
are compared with phenobarbital treatment alone,
the presence of phenobarbital decreased the
activities half as much as CP treatment alone
decreased these activities in the control animals
(aminopyrine demethylase, 15% vs 30%; AHH,
17% vs 37%). These results suggest that
phenobarbital probably induces various forms of
cytochrome P-450 isozymes that participate in the
activation as well as in the detoxification of CP.
Phenobarbital pretreatment also failed to render
CP depressant to the mixed function oxidase
activities in extrahepatic tissues such as kidney,
lungs and intestine.
Effect ofphenobarbital on the urotoxicity of CP
As reported previously (Berrigan et al., 1982) CP
treatment produced acute histopathologic changes
in the urinary bladders of rats examined 4 days
after CP administration. These changes included
EFFECTS OF THE INDUCTION OF CP METABOLISM 71
thickening of the bladder mucosa, ulceration, and
haemorrhagic and necrotic lesions in the mucosa.
Bloody exudate containing cellular debris, fibrin
and inflammatory cells was seen in the lumen. In
addition, focal changes of the seemingly intact
mucosa, including thinning, atypia and
Karyorrhexis were also observed. Diffuse
oedematous and haemorrhagic changes were also
seen in the submucosa.
Pretreatment of the rats with phenobarbital alone
or treatment of the rats with saline (control) had no
demonstrable effect on the urinary bladder
histology. However, when CP was administered to
rats pretreated with phenobarbital, only one of four
rats showed slight atypia and vacuolization of
epithelial cells of the mucosa and slight oedematous
and haemorrhagic changes in the submucosa. These
changes were mild relative to CP treatment alone.
These results clearly demonstrate the ability of
phenobarbital to afford significant protection
against CP-induced bladder damage.
Metabolism of CP by hepatic microsomes
The effects of phenobarbital and 3-
methylcholanthrene pretreatment on the formation
of the polar metabolites of CP by the hepatic
microsomes are shown in Table III. Simultaneous
presence of both NADPH and hepatic microsomes
was essential for the formation of the polar
metabolites. More [3H]-labelled metabolites than
[14C]-labelled metabolites were recovered in the
aqueous phase following chloroform extraction of
the incubation mixture. While 3-methylcholanthrene
pretreatment of the rats resulted in a mild
depression of the metabolism, phenobarbital
pretreatment enhanced the polar metabolite
formation 10 to 14-fold. Thin layer
chromatographic and HPLC analyses of the polar
fractions derived from larger incubations repeatedly
revealed the presence of a polar metabolite, which
has been tentatively identified as didechloro-
dihydroxy-CP (described below). This was not
formed in incubations lacking in NADPH and was
produced in only negligible amounts by hepatic
microsomes from control rats, whereas hepatic
microsomes from phenobarbital treated rats
produced large quantities of this metabolite.
The data on phenobarbital (Table III) also
suggest that of the total [3H]-labelled polar
metabolites -40% contain [14C]-label as well. This
is compatible with the formation of
didechlorodihydroxy-CP as at least one of the
major polar metabolites of CP. The only other CP
metabolite with only ['4C]-label would be acrolein
(see Figure 1) which is expected to be removed into
the chloroform phase during the extraction of the
incubation mixture. Using ['4C]-acrolein we found
that under the experimental conditions -90% of
acrolein is extracted by the chloroform:isoamyl
alcohol (95:5) mixture used to extract the
incubation mixtures. The difference between
[chloroethyl-3H]-CP and [4-14C]-CP radioactivity in
the aqueous phase is attributable to the presence of
phosphoramide mustard and its degradation
products (see Figure 1).
Metabolism of CP by the purified cytochrome P-450
from phenobarbital-treated rats
Cytochrome P-450, purified from phenobarbital
treated rats, was employed in the reconstituted
system to investigate the metabolism of both
[chloroethyl-3H]-CP and [4-14C]-CP. As described
earlier, the incubations were extracted with
chloroform, the aqueous phase was lyophilized, and
the residue extracted sequentially with chloroform
and methanol.
Radioactivity measurements demonstrated that
chloroform extracts consistently contained 20-35%

of the total radioactivity while methanol extract
contained 60-70% of the total radioactivity in the
incubates. The remaining radioactivity (5-10%) was
associated with the methanol-extracted residue.
Using authentic standards, - 90% of the
chloroform-extractable radioactivity cochromato-
graphed on silica gel thin layer plates, developed
with acetone:chloroform (3:1), with unmetabolized
CP, while small amounts cochromatographed
with alcophosphamide (- 5%), aldophosphamide
cyanohydrin (-4%) and dechloroethyl
CP (- 2%).
Methanol extracts, after treatment with
diazomethane to stabilize phosphoramide mustard
as its methyl ester, revealed on thin layer
chromatography (chloroform:methanol, 9:1) only
trace amounts of phosphoramide mustard, while
the major amount of radiactivity remained at the
origin of the silica gel plates. The high polarity of
the major radioactivite band was established by
TLC in different solvent systems.
Side-by-side TLC of methanol extracts of
incubates from [chloroethyl-3H]-CP and [4-14C]-CP
in a variety of TLC solvent systems (chloroform:
methanol [1:1] and [1:2], methanol alone, and
methanol:water [9:10] demonstrated by radio-
scanning that the Rfs of the major radioactive
component in extracts of both labels were identical.
Diazomethane treatment of both the [3H] and [14C]-
labelled major metabolite, either in total methanol
extracts or after TLC isolation, had no effect on
TLC mobility; this property demonstrates the
absence of an acidic function in the metabolite and
indicates that the metabolite has retained the
oxazaphosphorine ring intact.
Consideration of the foregoing data led to the
tentative identification of the metabolite as
didechlorodihydroxy-CP. Such a structure would be
expected to be polar and to be unaffected by
diazomethane and would retain both [3H] and [14C]
labels.
Likely routes to didechlorodihydroxy-CP would
involve selective hydrolytic displacement of the
chlorine groups in CP without concomitant hydro-
lysis of phosphoramide or P(V) alkyl ester bonds.
Since phosphoramides are sensitive to acid
hydrolysis but resist base hydrolysis, synthesis was
attempted by selective chlorine displacement from
[chloroethyl-3H]-CP by hydroxide ion in dilute
potassium hydroxide. The method was successful,
and the tritiated dihydroxy analog of CP was
isolated by TLC. Structural confirmation was
obtained by mass spectral analysis using the fast
atom bombardment technique. In the normal
(positive) mode, an intense peak of m/z 225
(strongest peak in spectrum) was observed
([M + 1]+). In the negative mode, a peak of m/z 223
(strongest peak in spectrum) was observed
([M-1i).
Synthetic 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]tetrahydro-
2H-1,3,2-oxazaphosphorine 2-oxide (didechloro-
dihydroxy-CP) was compared by TLC with the
major metabolite generated in incubates of the
isolated cytochrome P-450 fraction with
[chloroethyl-3H]-CP and [4-14C]-CP. Identical Rfs
were obtained in different solvent systems upon
side-by-side TLC on silica gel (Table IV).

identical conditions on the same day with collection
of 40 1-ml fractions followed by radioassay, gave
the major radioactivity in the same fraction (No.
19) in every case. In order to eliminate the
possibility of slight variation in HPLC retention
times of the major radioactive metabolite in [3H]-
and [14C]-incubates, [3H]- and ['4C]-TLC-isolated
fractions were mixed and separated by HPLC with
fraction collection and radioassay for [3H] and
[14C]. The major radioactivity observed in both [3H]
and [14C] channels appeared in the same fraction
(No. 18).
Consideration of the collected data on the
common, major [3H]- and [14C]-labelled metabolite
(high polarity; unaffected by diazomethane;
common to both labels; identical by side-by-side
TLC in several solvent systems and by precisely-
identical HPLC profile to synthetic
didechlorodihydroxy-CP; identical by co-elution
HPLC) strongly suggests that the metabolite is
didechlorodihydroxy-CP. Further confirmation was
obtained by converting the TLC-purified metabolite
to CP by the chlorinating agent thionyl chloride.
EFFECTS OF THE INDUCTION OF CP METABOLISM 73
Discussion
Recently, we reported that the metabolism of CP is
accompanied by inactivation of hepatic microsomal
cytochrome P-450 (Gurtoo et al., 1981). Our studies
have incriminated cyclophosphamide metabolite
acrolein in the depression of liver cytochrome P-450
and, in agreement with other reports (Brock et al.,
1979; Cox, 1979), have also implicated acrolein in
the causation of CP-associated haematuria and
bladder toxicity (Berrigan et al., 1982). However,
the present investigations have demonstrated that
while treatment of rats with CP depresses liver
mixed function oxidase activities, no such
depression of similar activities is produced in the
extrahepatic tissues. This result is compatible with
the likely possibility that most of the CP is
metabolized during its first pass through the liver
and sufficient amounts of CP, capable of producing
deleterious amounts of acrolein, do not reach
extrahepatic tissues. This interpretation would mean
that cytochrome P-450 in extrahepatic tissues is
probably equally sensitive to the deleterious effects
of the CP metabolite acrolein.
Phenobarbital is a well known inducer of various
forms of cytochrome P-450 (Guengerich et al.,
1982) and associated activities, including the
metabolism of CP (Sladek, 1972; Gurtoo et al.,
1978). Sladek (1972) reported that phenobarbital
pretreatment enhanced the hepatic microsomal
metabolism of CP to its alkylating metabolites; it
decreased the Km and enhanced the Vmax by
about 7-fold. However, various attempts to enhance
the chemotherapeutic activity and whole body
toxicity of CP have produced conflicting results.
Sladek (1972) reported that phenobarbital
pretreatment of male rats did not alter the
therapeutic activity of CP against Walker 256
carcinosarcoma. In other studies involving mice,
Field et al. (1971) found that while phenobarbital
pretreatment accelerated the production of
alkylating metabolites of CP, duration of
antileukaemic activity against L1210 leukaemic cells
was shortened by phenobarbital. Alberts & Wetters
(1976) found a constant 90% (1-log) reduction in
the toxicity of CP to P388 leukaemic colony
forming units in mice. In various studies on the
pharmacokinetics of CP in patients, phenobarbital
was found to accelarate the metabolism of CP and
reduce its half-life (Mallett et al., 1969; Jao et al.,
1972; Bagley et al., 1973). One report even
suggested that this increased activation in humans
may offer therapeutic advantage in the treatment of
cancer (Mallett et al., 1969). However, Jao et al.
(1972) found that phenobarbital, while increasing
the rate of biotransformation of CP 2 to 3-fold,
had no quantitatively significant effect on the
distribution and renal excretion of CP. These
investigators concluded that phenobarbital should
marginally enhance the efficacy and toxicity of CP
in man.
In the present report, we have demonstrated that
phenobarbital, which was earlier found to enhance
the formation of protein- and DNA-binding
metabolites of CP formed in vitro by the hepatic
microsomes (Gurtoo et al., 1978), failed to enhance
CP-induced depression of the hepatic mixed
function oxidase and also protected against the
toxicity of CP to the urinary bladder. This
enigmatous observation led to the rationalization
that phenobarbital, which is known to induce
various forms of cytochrome P-450, was inducing
both the activation and the detoxification of CP. If
this was true, it would explain the reported effects
of phenobarbital pretreatment on the therapeutic
efficacy and toxicity of CP: increase in the
formation of alkylating metabolites of CP both in
vivo and in vitro; decrease in t-, of CP, and minimal
effect on the toxicity and therapeutic activity of CP.
In fulfilment of the requirement to demonstrate
enhancement in the detoxification of CP by
phenobarbital, we demonstrated the formation of a
very polar metabolite, tentatively identified as
didechlorodihydroxy-CP. This metabolite was
found to be one of the major metabolites of CP
catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 isolated from
phenobarbital treated rats. This biotransformation
would essentially yield a detoxified product of CP.
We do not know at this stage whether the
monodechlorinated metabolite exists or whether 4-
hydroxy CP could be further metabolized to form
didechlorinated products. Further metabolism of
the primary metabolites by the mixed function
oxidase system is a well established metabolic route
in the biotransformation of several polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (Gelboin, 1980).
A precedent for replacement of chlorine by the
hydroxyl group in CP by cytochrome P-450 can be
found in studies on mixed function oxidation of
1,2-dichloroethane to 2-chloroethanol by
Guengerich et al. (1980). Additionally, in studies on
the urinary metabolites of CP in sheep, Bakke et al.
(1972) identified a minor metabolite whose
structure is similar to that of the cytochrome P-450
metabolite. Mass spectral analysis led to the
suggestion that the sheep metabolite was 5- or 6-
keto-didechlorodihydroxy-CP. The sheep metabolite
establishes a precedent for replacement of chlorine
by the hydroxyl group in CP in vivo.
The existence of a phenobarbital-inducible cyto-
chrome P-450 isozyme that is capable of dechlorin-
ating CP is consistent with the inability of
phenobarbital to appreciably enhance the
experimental antitumour effects of CP.

In summary, in this report, we have developed
mechanistic information at the biochemical level to
explain why phenobarbital may not enhance the
efficacy of CP and also that phenobarbital may be
useful in blocking some of the deleterious effects of
CP, especially denaturation of cytochrome P-450
and bladder toxicity.
