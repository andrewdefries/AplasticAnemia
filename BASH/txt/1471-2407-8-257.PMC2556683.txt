Abstract
Background: Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive DNA repair disorder with affected
individuals having a high risk of developing acute myeloid leukaemia and certain solid tumours.
Thirteen complementation groups have been identified and the genes for all of these are known
(FANCA, B, C, D1/BRCA2, D2, E, F, G, I, J/BRIP1, L, M and N/PALB2). Previous studies of cancer
incidence in relatives of Fanconi anemia cases have produced conflicting results. A study of British
FA families was therefore carried out to investigate this question, since increases in cancer risk in
FA heterozygotes would have implications for counselling FA family members, and possibly also for
the implementation of preventative screening measures in FA heterozygotes.
Methods: Thirty-six families took part and data was collected on 575 individuals (276 males, 299
females), representing 18,136 person years. In this cohort, 25 males and 30 females were reported
with cancer under the age of 85 years, and 36 cancers (65%) could be confirmed from death
certificates, cancer registries or clinical records.
Results: A total of 55 cancers were reported in the FA families compared to an estimated
incidence of 56.95 in a comparable general population cohort, and the relative risk of cancer was
0.97 (95% C.I. = 0.71–1.23, p = 0.62) for FA family members. Analysis of relative risk for individual
cancer types in each carrier probability group did not reveal any significant differences with the
possible exception of prostate cancer (RR = 3.089 (95% C.I. = 1.09 – 8.78; Χ2 = 4.767, p = 0.029).
Conclusion: This study has not shown a significant difference in overall cancer risk in FA families.
Background
It has long been hypothesised that heterozygotes for auto-
somal recessive DNA repair disorders may have reduced
efficiency of their DNA repair systems which could cause
an increased risk of cancer [1]. This hypothesis has been
upheld by molecular and epidemiological studies of can-
cer incidence in Ataxia Telangiectasia which have con-
firmed a two-fold increased risk of breast cancer in female
ATM heterozygotes [2,3]. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an auto-
somal recessive bone marrow failure syndrome due to
mutations in at least 13 different genes (FANCA, B, C, D1/
BRCA2, D2, E, F, G, I, J/BRIP1, L, M and N/PALB2) [4,5]

and the incidences of acute myeloid leukaemia and cer-
tain solid tumours are all greatly increased in homozy-
gotes [6]. Epidemiological studies of cancer risk in FA
heterozygotes are conflicting: the initial study by Swift et
al. analysed 102 deaths in the relatives of eight FA families
and found a higher rate of leukaemia and gastric, colorec-
tal and tongue cancer [7]. However, none of these was sta-
tistically significant and when the study was expanded to
25 families no overall or specific excess of cancers could
be demonstrated, and indeed there were fewer leukaemias
than expected [8]. A separate study of 125 relatives in nine
FA families also failed to show a difference [9]. While
molecular studies investigating cancer risk in heterozy-
gotes have mostly been inconclusive (reviewed in [10]), a
recent molecular study of 944 relatives of FA probands did
suggest an increased risk of breast cancer in FANCC muta-
tion carriers [11].
In view of these conflicting data we carried out a study of
British FA families to investigate this question further,
since increases in cancer risk in FA heterozygotes would
have implications for counselling FA family members,
and possibly also for the implementation of preventative
screening measures in FA carriers.
Methods
Data collection
Families with individuals affected with FA were traced by
contacting haematologists with an interest in FA and clin-
ical geneticists throughout the UK as well as using the
resources of the FA patient support group. The study had
Multi Centre Research Ethics Committee approval (MREC
00/1/66). Eligible families were contacted through their
hospital specialist or general practitioner and were sent an
information sheet and consent form. If they agreed to take
part in the study, individuals from these families were
asked to fill out a detailed questionnaire about their
health and that of their relatives, with particular reference
to any malignancies. Where possible, cancer diagnoses
were confirmed by obtaining consent from the affected
person to contact their clinician, or use of regional cancer
registries, or obtaining the death certificate. Cancers were
then classified according to the ICD10 criteria [12].
Ninety-six families were identified. Of these, 8 were not
suitable (mainly foreign nationals having treatment but
not living in the UK), 8 were unwilling to participate, and
14 did not have adequate contact details. Of the remain-
ing individuals from 66 families, 21 did not reply to the
invitation to take part in the study and 9 did not return the
completed questionnaire. Data was obtained on 695 indi-
viduals from 26 "full" families and 10 "half" families,
where no data was available on one side of the family
because one of the parents was adopted (2 families), not
in contact (3 families) or unwilling to participate (5 fam-
ilies). Three families were consanguineous; in two of the
families the parents were first cousins and in the third they
were second cousins.
Statistical Analysis
The principal aim of this study was to estimate the risks of
cancer in FA gene mutation carriers. A cohort of the fol-
lowing individuals was constructed: (a) FA family mem-
bers with a carrier probability of 0.25 or greater (up to and
including great-grandparents, great uncles and aunts and
cousins) who were affected with cancer under the age of
85 years, (b) FA members unaffected with cancer, with a
carrier probability of 0.25 or greater.
In order to compute incidence rates for individuals not
affected with cancer, follow-up was deemed to commence
on their date of birth or 1st January 1960, whichever was
the later, and to cease on the date of their first cancer, their
date of death or loss to follow-up, their 85th birthday, or
31st December 2001, whichever occurred first. Follow-up
before 1960 was ignored to minimise errors in classifica-
tion of tumours and because reliable population specific
incidence rates were available for almost all centres from
that date, but often not before. FA homozygotes were also
excluded from the analysis.
After removing those cases with no follow-up in the rele-
vant period, the final cohort comprised 575 individuals
(276 males, 299 females), representing 18,136 person
years. In this cohort, 25 males and 30 females were diag-
nosed with cancer under the age of 85. Thirty-six (65%) of
the total of 55 cancers analysed were confirmed; 20 (36%)
from cancer registry information, 9 (16%) from death cer-
tificates and 7 (13%) from clinical records. In two out of
the 36 cases, the confirmed cancer diagnosis differed from
that reported by the relatives (a case of renal cancer which
had been reported as liver cancer and a case of colorectal
cancer which had been reported as stomach cancer) which
implied an error rate of cancer type misreporting by rela-
tives of at least 5.5%.
Expected numbers of cancers were computed in the usual
manner by multiplying person-years at risk by the appro-
priate age, sex, period, site, and population-specific inci-
dence rates, using the programme Person Years [13]. The
relevant rates were obtained from combined data from
Cancer Registries in the UK. A separate relative risk was
estimated for each ten-year age-group 20–29, 30–39, 40–
49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, relative to population inci-
dence rates. (For this purpose population incidence rates
averaged over all centres were used). These estimates were
then used to derive the cumulative risk estimates, using
previously described methods [14]. Relative risks were
also calculated for all cancers in each carrier probability
group, and an overall relative risk for carriers was calcu-

lated using the EM algorithm [15] as previously described
[2].
Results
The observed versus expected incidence, p-value (Poisson
1-sided) and 95% confidence intervals of the most fre-
quent cancers in the relatives of FA patients are given in
Table 1. Head and neck cancer and leukaemias are also
listed, as these are common in FA homozygotes. There
were no observed cases of other cancers that commonly
occur in FA homozygotes (oesophageal, vulval, anal), and
other cancers had an observed incidence of 2 cases or less.
The results show no significantly different relative risks for
any of the cancers and, given the small numbers studied,
there is a wide range for many of the associated confi-
dence intervals. The overall observed number of cancers is
very similar to the expected number, with a relative risk of
0.97 (0.71–1.23) for FA family members.
The relative risk of all cancer in relation to carrier proba-
bility is given in Table 2. There were no significant differ-
ences in relative risk across the groups, and the rates of all
cancers were similar in each group, suggesting that there is
little bias in the data. As expected, most of the cancers
occurred in the 0.25 carrier probability group, which
mainly consisted of great-grandparents and great uncles
and aunts. The overall relative risk of all cancers in FA gene
carriers was calculated to be 0.946 (95% confidence limits
0.61 – 1.46; Χ2 = 0.0279, p = 0.867).
Analysis of relative risk for individual cancer types in each
carrier probability group did not reveal any significant dif-
ferences apart from an increased incidence of prostate
cancer in obligate male carriers; 2 cases were observed in
33 individuals when the expected incidence was 0.17 (O/
E = 11.5, 95% C.I. = 1.7 – 78.9, p = 0.013). When this was
combined with prostate case incidences in other carrier
groups there were a total of five cases and the overall rela-
tive risk of prostate cancer in carriers was calculated to be
3.089 (95% confidence limits 1.09 – 8.78; Χ2 = 4.767, p =
0.029).
Discussion
This is the first study of cancer predisposition in UK FA
families and our data suggest that there is no overall
increased cancer risk in these families. Sixty-five percent of
the reported cancers could be confirmed independently,
and the cancer-type misreporting rate by relatives was
5.5%. It was not known how many family cancers had
been missed by not being reported by relatives, and this
could be a potential source of under-ascertainment.
Another source of under-ascertainment could result from
a situation where a family could not be contacted because
one or both of the parents had died from cancer, resulting
in a family with a potentially higher cancer incidence not
being included in the study. Conversely, over-ascertain-
ment could result from selection bias where relatives who
perceived an increased number of cancer cases in their
families were more willing to take part. The fact that rates
of all cancers are similar in each carrier probability group
suggests that the overall level of bias is small.
Three cancers occurred in 64 obligate carriers: a case of fol-
licular thyroid cancer in a female (confirmed by her clini-
cian, diagnosed age 52) and two cases of prostate cancer
in males (one confirmed, diagnosed age 71, one uncon-
firmed, diagnosed age 69). If these observations were
extrapolated to calculate relative risk, it would result in
significantly increased risks for both cancers in FA muta-
tion carriers. It is quite possible that these are chance
occurrences, particularly in the case of the thyroid cancer.
The increased incidence of prostate cancer is interesting in
view of involvement of BRCA2/FANCD1 in the FA gene
pathway; male BRCA2 carriers have an increased risk of
prostate cancer [14] so there is a theoretical molecular
link. In the study by Berwick et al. [11], there was an
increased incidence of prostate cancer in a group that
included BRCA2 carriers and others of unknown comple-

mentation status. Taken together, these two studies sug-
gest that there could be a modest increased risk in prostate
cancer in some FA heterozygotes and which merits further
investigation.
Our study had a number of limitations that are important
to the interpretation of our findings. Complementation
data was not available on the majority of the FA families
in the study so analysis according to FA gene groups could
not be carried out. Given the manner in which these fam-
ilies were ascertained and the ethnic heterogeneity of the
UK population, it is likely that the complementation
group frequencies would be similar to those previously
determined, and that the majority (around two-thirds) of
affected families would have FANCA mutations. Families
where FA is due to biallelic BRCA2 mutations will clearly
have an increased cancer risk, but these cases are rare
(<2% of all FA) and none of the families in this study had
a pedigree typical of autosomal dominant breast/ovarian
cancer predisposition. It has recently been established that
mutations in two other FA genes may confer an increased
risk of breast cancer; the increased risk for FANCJ/BRIP1 is
around 2-fold [16], and that for FANCN/PALB2 is proba-
bly 2–4 fold [17,18], but may be higher for certain muta-
tions [19]. Like FANCD1/BRCA2, both these
complementation groups are rare (<1% of FA cases) and
interestingly all three of these FA genes act downstream of
FANCD2 [20]. In their recently published study Berwick et
al. found a possible increased incidence of breast cancer in
carrier females, with the highest risk in FANCC mutation
carriers (SIR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1–5.2) [1]. No overall
increased risk of breast cancer was seen in our study but
the number of families with FANCC mutations would
have been small as this group accounts for less than 10%
of non-Ashkenazi Jewish FA cases. A previous study of
familial breast cancer cases did not identify mutations in
FANCA, C, D2, E, F, G [21], so at present it remains
unclear whether FANCC, which acts upstream of
FANCD2, is a breast cancer predisposing gene.
Conclusion
This study did not find any significant difference in cancer
incidence in FA families compared to population esti-
mates, with the possible exception of prostate cancer. It
therefore seems that only in those rare families with FA
cases due to BRCA2 or FANCJ/FANCN mutations is cancer
risk in heterozygotes a salient factor.
