Abstract
Background: Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are a substantial cause of hospital admissions. We conducted a
nationwide study to estimate the burden of hospital admissions for ADRs in Spain during a six-year period (2001-
2006) along with the associated total health cost.
Methods: Data were obtained from the national surveillance system for hospital data (Minimum Basic Data Set)
maintained by the Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs, and covering more than 95% of Spanish hospitals.
From these admissions we selected all hospitalization that were code as drug-related (ICD-9-CM codes E), but
intended forms of overdoses, errors in administration and therapeutics failure were excluded. The average number
of hospitalizations per year, annual incidence of hospital admissions, average length of stay in the hospital, and
case-fatality rate, were calculated.
Results: During the 2001-2006 periods, the total number of hospitalized patients with ADR diagnosis was 350,835
subjects, 1.69% of all acute hospital admissions in Spain. The estimated incidence of admissions due to ADR
decreased during the period 2001-2006 (p < 0.05). More than five percent of patients (n = 19,734) died during an
ADR-related hospitalization. The drugs most commonly associated with ADR-related hospitalization were
antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs (n = 75,760), adrenal cortical steroids (n = 47,539), anticoagulants
(n = 26,546) and antibiotics (n = 22,144). The costs generated by patients in our study increased by 19.05%
between 2001 and 2006.
Conclusions: Approximately 1.69% of all acute hospital admissions were associated with ADRs. The rates were
much higher for elderly patients. The total cost of ADR-related hospitalization to the Spanish health system is high
and has increased between 2001 and 2006. ADRs are an important cause of admission, resulting in considerable
use of national health system beds and a significant number of deaths.

Background
In the current public health framework, the importance
of drugs as determinants of the nation’s health is an
area that requires special attention [1,2], especially when
we attempt to ascertain whether patterns of consump-
tion reveal a rational use of medication.
Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are one of the leading
causes of morbidity in developed countries and repre-
sent a substantial burden on health care resources [3].
Different studies carried out over the last 10 years to
identify the incidence of adverse reactions associated
with specific medications have revealed a significant
number of hospital admissions (2.4%-6.5% of total hos-
pital admissions [4-10], many of which are preventable.
Therefore, this area of health surveillance is worthy of
study.
Also to be taken into consideration are the high direct
costs associated with the morbidity and mortality and
treatment of ADRs. At the end of the 1990s, Bates et al
calculated the annual costs generated by ADRs to be
$5.6 million dollars [11], without taking into account
associated indirect costs, such as time off work and
reduced productivity [12,13].

We studied all hospital admissions and the associated
health costs in Spain during the period 2001-2006 in
order to estimate the incidence and characteristics of
ADR-related hospitalization. This is a national study to
be carried out in Spain to analyze ADR-related
hospitalization
Methods
A retrospective, descriptive, epidemiologic study was
conducted, using the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS)
as the data source. The MBDS is a national hospital
admission database managed by the Ministry of Health
and Social Policy that shows all hospitalizations for
which the diagnoses are coded according to the Spanish
version of the International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)
[14,15]. The physician is the one responsible for making
the report; it cannot be completed by another
professional.
Aside from diagnoses at discharge (primary and sec-
ondary diagnosis), the variables covered by the MBDS
are hospital data, patient data (name, date of birth, gen-
der, place of residence, and date of admission), surgical
and obstetric procedures, other procedures, and date
and type of discharge. Estimated MBDS coverage is 95%
of hospital admissions nationwide [16].
The criteria used for the identification of ADRs were
those established by the World Health Organization.
The WHO defines an ADR as a noxious and unintended
response to a drug that occurs at doses normally used in
humans for the prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of dis-
ease, or for the modification of physiological function
[17]. However, we must bear in mind that establishing
the number of admissions due to ADRs depends signifi-
cantly on the methodology used for their detection [18].
We selected MBDS data corresponding to hospital
admissions during the study period with a diagnosis of
ADR (ICD-9-CM codes E930 to E949; in any diagnostic
position). Other adverse events (eg, accidents, suicides,
accidental overdose, dosing errors) were excluded.
The data obtained included dates of admission and
discharge, age, sex, average length of stay, and outcome
(survival to hospital discharge or death).
We also calculated the average number of hospitaliza-
tions per year, annual incidence of hospital admissions
(per 100,000 people), average length of stay in the hospi-
tal, and case-fatality rate (%). As the denominator, we
used data on the population covered by hospitals
included in the MBDS surveillance system, adjusted for
population figures obtained from the 2001-2007 Spanish
census projection. It was assumed that the age distribu-
tion of the population covered by these public hospitals
was similar to that of the general population. The
annual number of days of hospitalization was calculated
by using the cumulative average number of cases per
year and the average length of stay in the hospital.
We analyzed related comorbidity, mortality, and the
direct medical cost to the health system of ADR-related
hospitalizations. These costs were calculated using diag-
nosis related groups (DRG) for this condition. Accord-
ing to the DRG reimbursement system, every
hospitalized patient belongs to a group of diagnostically
homogeneous cases; therefore, patients within each cate-
gory are similar clinically and are expected to use the
same level of hospital resources. As a result, patients in
the same DRG group are assigned the same reimburse-
ment charges [19].
Differences in proportions were assessed using the
Chi-square test, and confidence intervals (95% CI) were
calculated. ANOVA was used for multiple comparisons.
Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 (two-tailed).
Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS for windows, version
14.0; Chicago, Illinois, USA). Multivariate analysis of
time trends in study variables was performed using Pois-
son regression models. Values were deemed statistically
significant at P < 0.05.
Results
During the 2001-2006 period, a total of 350,835 indivi-
duals were hospitalized with an ADR as their primary or
secondary diagnosis, according to the MBDS. The prin-
cipal characteristics of the study population are sum-
marized in Table 1. This figure represented 1.69% (95%
CI, 1.65-1.73) of all acute hospital admissions in Spain.
In our study, 5.64% (95% CI, 5.32-5.96) of patients (n =
19,734) died during an ADR-related hospitalization, that
is, 0.1% of all hospitalizations during the study period.

regression models adjusted by age and sex. The estimated
incidence of admissions due to ADR decreased (145 cases
per 100,000 people in 2001 to 136 cases per 100,000 peo-
ple in 2006) (p < 0.05); median stay remained unchanged.
Patients admitted with an ADR had a median stay of
eight days (interquartile range 10).
For age group and sex, and during all the years of the
study period, we observed that the proportion of ADR-
related hospitalizations increased in both men and
women aged 56 and over. More men than women were
admitted, except in those aged > 75 years (42.5% [95%
CI, 42.1-42.8]) (Table 3).
Table 4 shows the diagnoses and medications most
commonly associated with ADR. Antineoplastic and
immunosuppressive drugs (n = 75,760), adrenal corti-
costeroids (n = 47,539), anticoagulants (n = 26,546), and
antibiotics (n = 22,144) all appear within the first ten.
The most commons diagnoses in cases of ADR-related
hospitalization were neutropenia (unspecified) (5%),
obstructive chronic bronchitis (4.9%), and congestive
heart failure (3.1%).
Table 5 shows the development of costs for all ADR-
related hospitalizations during the study period by age
group and sex. Using the DRGs for the study codes, the
estimated cost per patient and year was €3,857 in 2001
and €4,382 in 2006, with a total cost in 2001 of
€226,128,029 and in 2006 of €272,971,610. The cost of
admissions among these patients increased significantly
(p < 0.05). If we eliminate the effect of the consumer
price index, costs generated by patients in our study
increased by 19.05% between 2001 and 2006.
For the whole study period, total hospital costs were
greater for patients aged 56 years and over than in the
other groups.
Discussion
Our results show that there were 350,835 ADR-related
hospitalizations (almost 1.7% of all hospitalizations) in
Spain between 2001 and 2006. These results are similar
to those obtained in Holland by Hooft et al, [4] who
aimed to ascertain the incidence of ADR-related hospi-
talization over 1 year. However, in a population-based

cohort study carried out in 2003, the same group found
a prevalence of ADR-related admissions of 5.1% [7],
which is consistent with the results reported by other
authors, who obtained higher values of ADR-related
hospitalization [5,6,10,20,21]. These differences are due
to the different types of study and methodology used, as
well as to the definition of ADR applied.
Since Lazarou et al. [22] concluded at the end of the
1990s that the incidence of fatal ADRs in US hospitals
was extremely high (0.31% of all hospitalizations), other
authors have reached similar conclusions a decade later
[7]. Our results show that more than 5% of ADR-related
hospitalizations had a fatal outcome (0.1% of all hospita-
lizations). These results are consistent with those
obtained in a prospective study carried out in England
by Pirmohamed [6] et al, who detected a 0.15% inci-
dence of fatal ADRs.
The prevalence of ADRs varied between the different
age groups, with elderly patients experiencing far more
ADRs than children or adults. In our study the rates of

ADR-related hospitalization have a frequency of 3.3% in
children and a frequency of 35.9% in elderly (75 years
and over). These results are consistent with data in the
meta-analysis of Beijer HJ [23], who showed that the
probability of being hospitalized due to ADR-related
problems is 4 times higher for elderly people than for
younger people (16.6% vs. 4.1%). Elderly patients are
particularly vulnerable to ADRs because they take multi-
ple-drug regimens and experience age-associated
changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
Similarly, the Italian study by Onder et al [10] con-
cluded that the most important determinant of risk for
ADR-related hospital admissions in older patients is the
number of drugs being taken (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-
1.25) for each new drug taken).
The most commonly involved drugs were antineoplas-
tic drugs, and this is consistent with the results obtained
by Zhang M et al. [24] using data from the Western
Australia Hospital Morbidity Data System, which
showed that medication is responsible for 11.0% of
ADR-related hospital admissions in elderly Australians.
As was the case with other investigators, [4,7,9,25,26]
we observed high percentages of ADRs were for anticoa-
gulants and diuretics. These drug groups have a high
innate toxicity, with both diuretics and oral anticoagu-
lants requiring close monitoring for safe use. In addi-
tion, these drug groups are often used in elderly patients
who are more susceptible to adverse reactions.
It is noteworthy that antibiotics appear in 22.1% of
ADR-related hospitalizations in Spain. Similarly,
research carried out in the United Kingdom by Kong-
kaew et al [5] in a systematic review of observational
studies revealed that 42.6% of ADRs in children were
associated with anti-infective drugs. In Italy, Trifiro
et al. [8] studied the incidence of ADRs and ADR-
related hospital admissions after visits to the emer-
gency department and found that antibiotics were
associated with 12.9% of ADRs. Should be noted the
intrinsic value of such a coding system is easy to
perform for drugs which have “clear” endpoints for
toxicity (ADRs) like neutropenia (antineoplastic drugs/
immunosuppressive drugs), diuretics (disturbances in
electrolytes), adrenal corticoids (diabetes induction,
osteoporosis induction etc.) and anticoagulants
(bleeding).
In Spain, the total cost to the health system caused by
ADR-related hospitalization during the study period was
around €1.533 billion; annual costs increased from €226
million in the year 2001 to €272 million in 2006. This
represents a considerable cost. It is interesting to note
that recent studies have shown that the excess hospital
cost of ADRs in the USA were estimated at $2000 to
$3000 dollars per patient [11,12], which is somewhat
lower than in our study.
Our study is limited in that the proportion of ADR-
related hospitalizations is probably an underestimation
of the real situation. With regard to underreporting, this
can be attributed to different causes. Among these is the
difficulty associated with the codification of these pro-
cesses according to the International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision, which quite often does not
include the drug causing the reaction, only the ADR
without specifying the origin. Physicians might therefore
consider this codification as to be used only for admin-
istrative purposes and would be less concerned with
accurately recording these ICD codes. The minimum
basic data set is a useful tool for the identification,
quantification and analysis of adverse drug reactions, as
has been demonstrated in previous studies [20]. How-
ever, according to data from the Sistema Español de
Farmacovigilancia (Spanish Surveillance System), these
reactions are clearly underreported in the hospital envir-
onment as they are little noted in discharge reports. We
evaluated hospitalizations retrospectively and, therefore,
depended on information from electronic medical
records. In fact if we compare the results of our study
with others conducted in Spain [27], in which the pro-
portion of hospital admissions due to adverse reactions
is 4.2%, it is three times higher than the result provided
by this manuscript. This also occurs when comparing
the results with those of other countries as the work of
Lazarou et al. [22], or Van der Hooft et al [7].
Another limitation of this study may be that ADR-
related hospitalizations also include cases in which the
ADR occurred during the admission. Furthermore, hos-
pitalizations for which the E-code corresponds to a sec-
ondary diagnosis may have been admissions during
which the ADR occurred or admissions caused by the
ADR.
The limitations of the MBDS as a tool for detecting
ADRs primarily stem from the express mention of the
corresponding ADR on the discharge report written by
the physician, as only what is codified is transcribed,
and the physician is the one responsible for making this
report. A second limitation is the degree of codification
of the diagnosis reported on the discharge report form:
incorrect codification, variation among codifiers, human
error. Physicians might therefore consider this codifica-
tion as to be used only for administrative purposes and
would be less concerned with accurately recording these
ICD codes
Nevertheless, we believe that the length of the study
period and the exhaustive data provided by the MBDS
provide sufficient internal validity that, in quantitative
terms, is seen in the constant frequency of episodes
detected every year and, in qualitative terms, in the
identification of age groups at greater risk. The high
proportion of elderly patients and the cohort survival

effect in women aged more than 70 years is consistent
with the results of other studies.
Finally, the system of cost assignment was based on
DRGs. Although DRGs have been used to improve the
classification system for hospital cost analysis, they do
present a series of limitations [28,29]. DRG tariffs were
used as unit costs instead of real costs. Tariffs can intro-
duce distortion for administrative reasons; in the case of
death, the recognized tariffs are doubled. This system is
not specifically designed for individual ADR-related
hospitalisations.
The minimum basic data set is a useful tool for the
identification, quantification and analysis of adverse
drug reactions, as has been demonstrated in previous
studies. However, according to data from the Sistema
Español de Farmacovigilancia (Spanish Pharmacovigi-
lance System), these reactions are clearly underreported
in the hospital environment as they are little noted in
discharge reports.
Conclusions
During the study period, a total of 350,835 individuals
were hospitalized due to ADRs in Spain (1.69% of all
acute hospital admissions). The rates were much higher
for elderly patients. The total cost of ADR-related hospi-
talization to the Spanish health system is high and has
increased between 2001 and 2006.
In conclusion, ADRs are an important cause of admis-
sion, resulting in considerable use of national health sys-
tem beds and a significant number of deaths. The risk is
that with this data source, the prevalence or incidence
of ADRs as a public health problem is underestimated.
