Benzene-induced Chromosome Aberrations:
A Follow-up Study
Alessandra Forni
Institute of Occupational Health, University of Milan, Italy
To study the evolution of cytogenetic damage from past exposure to high concentrations of
benzene and its health significance, chromosome aberrations (CA) in lymphocytes were
reinvestigated after approximately 20 years in four subjects with past severe hemopathy and in
seven controls studied in the late 1960s. Increased chromosome-type aberrations were still
present up to 30 years after benzene toxicity, but blood counts were normal. The vital status at
the end of 1993 was ascertained for 32 subjects with a history of benzene toxicity and for 31
controls studied for CA from 1965 to 1970, who differed significantly for CA rates. Of the 32
benzene-exposed subjects, 1 was lost to follow-up, 20 were still alive, and 11 had died at ages 36
to 83, between 1 and 20 years after the last CA study. Five deaths were from neoplasia (acute
erythroleukemia, brain tumor, cancer of lung, paranasal cavity, esophagus). The deceased subjects
had significantly higher rates of chromosome-type aberrations than those alive, and those who died
of neoplasia had the highest rates of these aberrations in the last study before death or diagnosis
of cancer. Out of the 31 controls, 12 had died from 4 to 23 years after the CA study. Three deaths
were from neoplasia (two lung cancer, one brain tumor). Even if this is a small sample, the results
suggest a higher risk of cancer for the benzene-exposed cohort, who had persistently high CA
rates in lymphocytes. Environ Health Perspect 104(Suppl 6):1309-1312 (1996)

Introduction
When inhaled at high concentrations, ben-
zene is myelotoxic and leukemogenic for
humans, and it is known to induce struc-
tural and numerical changes in experimen-
tal animals and in man (1). Chromosome
aberrations (CA) in cultured peripheral
blood lymphocytes are a biomarker ofearly
biological effect of exposure to genotoxic
agents in humans (2). In the late 1960s,
CA in peripheral blood lymphocytes were
repeatedly studied in 32 subjects with a
history of occupational benzene poisoning
and were significantly increased in most
exposed individuals, compared to matched
controls, even several years after cessation
ofexposure and recovery from toxicity (3).
The prognostic significance of increased
CA in lymphocytes, especially if persistent
in time, for later cancer risk, is still debated.
It is generally agreed that CA might be
indicators of increased cancer risk at a
group level but not at the individual level
(2). Long-term follow-up of individuals
and groups investigated for CA is necessary
to solve this problem.
With this purpose in mind, stimulated
by the work of Saracci (4), a follow-up
study was started in the 1980s of benzene-
exposed cases cytogenetically studied in the
1960s (3) and ofa group ofcontrols inves-
tigated in the same period. In particular,
CA in lymphocytes were studied again in a
few exposed cases and controls after
approximately 20 years, and the vital status
of cases and controls was ascertained and
the cause of death was registered.The
results of this updated follow-up study are
reported here.
This paper was presented at Benzene '95: An International Conference on the Toxicity, Carcinogenesis, and
Epidemiology of Benzene held 17-20 June 1995 in Piscataway, New Jersey. Manuscript received 16 January
1996; manuscript accepted 14 June 1996.

Methods
The 32 cases followed up (17 males, 15
females) are those first studied from 1965
to 1970, reported by Forni et al. (3); i.e.,
25 subjects who had suffered from benzene
hemopathy (severe in 15 cases) 1 to 18
years before the first CA study; 4 subjects
with signs of benzene-induced bone mar-
row toxicity at time of the first cytogenetic
study; and 3 subjects recovered from acute
benzene poisoning. Case numbers, when
reported, are those used for identification
in the original study (3).
Out of the 31 referents (22 males, 9
females), 14 were matched controls in the
original study, and the others were healthy
subjects cytogenetically studied in the
same period who served as controls for
other studies.
Four female cases (nos. 15, 16, 24, and
26), who had suffered from severe benzene
hemopathy in 1961, 1962, 1958, and
1968, respectively, and had received several
CA studies in the sixties, were restudied
from 1985 to 1988; case no. 26 received
one additional cytogenetic study in April
1995. Seven referents (5 males and 2
females), first studied from 1965 to 1969,
were reinvestigated from 1986 to 1991.
Complete blood counts and updating of
clinical histories were performed at the time
of cytogenetic follow-up. Informed consent
for cytogenetic reinvestigation was obtained.
The vital status of the 32 cases and the
31 controls was first ascertained through
the municipality of residence by T. Vai of
our institute, and again in 1993 as a part of
a multicenter investigation (5). The cause
of death was drawn from the death certifi-
cates, but for some cases and controls the
clinical history and more precise hospital
diagnoses were reported.
Lymphocyte cultures in the 1960s were
performed using two methods and har-
vested at 68 to 70 hr (3). The cytogenetic
reinvestigations in the 1980s were carried
out on 48- and 70-hr cultures of whole
blood with no significant differences, but
the results of 3-day cultures were used for a
better comparison with the old data. one-
hundred metaphases were counted and
scored for structural CA according to the
International System for Human Cyto-
genetic Nomenclature (ISCN) (6). For the
old data, the original protocols were
reviewed, and chromatid-type aberrations
(ct-A) (excluding gaps), which in the
original study had been scored but not
reported, were included in the evaluation.

Hyperdiploid cells with apparently normal
extra chromosomes were separated from
cells with stable aberrations and recorded
as such. Aneuploidy was evaluated only
considering percentage of hyperdiploid
cells, since hypodiploid cells in lymphocyte
cultures may result from artifactual loss.
For statistical analysis, cells with struc-
tural aberrations were grouped as: ct-A,
with chromatid-type aberrations; Cu, with
unstable chromosome-type aberrations
(acentric fragments, dicentric and ring
chromosomes); and Cs, with stable chro-
mosome aberrations (abnormal monocen-
tric chromosomes due to deletions,
translocations, inversions).
Statistical comparison, when required,
was carried out by the Mann-Whitney
U-test.
Results
Cytogenetic and Clinical Follow-up
At the time of reinvestigation, both cases
and controls had normal blood counts and
were clinically healthy, with the exception
of case no. 24, who had type II diabetes
and had been under treatment with oral
antidiabetics for the last 10 years.
The results of the first and last CA
studies in four cases and seven controls are
summarized in Table 1. The rate of chro-
matid-type aberrations did not differ
between cases and controls. CA were sig-
nificanty higher in the exposed subjects
than in the controls in the first study; in
the last study, they were still higher, but
the difference was not statistically signifi-
cant due to an increase of Cu in three out
of seven controls. The differences between
cases and controls were more pronounced
when considering cells with complex aber-
rations involving more than one break
(data not shown).
It is interesting that Cs in the exposed
subjects have decreased over the last two
decades, while there has been an increase of
Cu, which paralleled that of the controls.
Hyperdiploid cells were significantly
increased in the exposed subjects versus the
controls both in the first and in the last
study (Table 1).
Case no. 26, studied for the first time
when severe pancytopenic developed in late
pregnancy, should be noted. The long-term
follow-up shows an overall decrease in struc-
tural CA (Table 2). In the most recent
study, this woman, now 49 years old, had
one dicentric chromosome and three hyper-
diploid cells in 100 metaphases. Blood
counts were normal. She had no complaints.

Recently, in a check-up performed because
she wanted to become a volunteer blood
donor, she has been found positive for HBV
and HCV antibodies but negative for HBV
antigens. Her 27-year-old healthy son, who
was born in 1968 when the patient
received numerous blood transfusions, is
also positive for HBV and HCV antibod-
ies. This woman, after benzene poisoning,
delivered two more babies (one male, one
female) both normal and currently healthy.
The pregnancy outcomes of the two
other married cases are interesting as well.
Case no. 15 had one normal pregnancy in
1971 and delivered one normal daughter.
Case 16 had five normal pregnancies in
1966, 1967, 1969, 1970, and 1975, respec-
tively, and delivered four males and one
female; the first baby died at 7 months of
bronchopneumonia, the others are healthy.
Vital Status and Clinical Data
The results of the ascertainment of vital
status for benzene-exposed subjects and
controls are summarized in Table 3.
Out of32 cases, 1 was lost to follow-up;
20 are alive; and 11 died 1 to 20 years after
the last cytogenetic study. Ofthese, five died
ofneoplastic disease (case no. 9, age 67, ery-
throleukemia; case no. 18, age 43, cancer of
the paranasal cavity; case no. 19, age 36,
brain tumor; case no. 20, age 59, lung
cancer; case no. 24, age 69, cancer of the
esophagus). The cancer deaths occurred 10

to 34 years after benzene poisoning, 2 to 27
years after the first CA study, and 1 to 4
years after the last cytogenetic study. Four of
the five cancer deaths are clustered between
2 and 6 years from the first CA study. Four
of the 5 cancer deaths and 3 deaths from
nonneoplastic disease occurred among the
15 cases who had suffered from severe ben-
zene hemopathy. A few cases deserve a
special comment.
Case no. 9, who died in 1973, had
suffered from severe benzene hemopathy in
1957 at age 51 and had completely normal
blood counts in 1967 to 1969 when she
participated in three CA studies, which
showed, respectively, 4, 4, and 5% CA
(with complex aberrations). In 1972, she

developed pancytopenia with immature
cells of the white and red blood series in
the peripheral blood. A CA study of cul-
tured blood lymphocytes in September
1972 showed 4% Cu (including one
dicentric and two ring chromosomes). Three
bone marrow punctures were void. One
direct preparation of peripheral blood
yielded two metaphases only, not suitable for
analysis. The final diagnosis was acute ery-
throleukemia. This was the last case of ben-
zene leukemia observed in our institute and
was, in our experience, the only case of late
onset leukemia, with a latency time of 15
years from cessation ofexposure to benzene.
Case no. 18, who died from cancer of
the left maxillary sinus at the age of 43,
had suffered from severe benzene hemopa-
thy at the age of 32 and developed cancer
of the paranasal cavity at the age of 40. He
had been a shoeworker since age 16, in dif-
ferent factories, engaged in various jobs
involving exposure to both benzene-con-
taining glues and leather dust.
Case no. 20, who died from lung
cancer at age 59 in 1969, was a smoker. He
had worked in a rotogravure plant and had
suffered from severe benzene poisoning in
1953.
Case no. 31, who suffered from acute
benzene poisoning of moderate degree and
died at age 83 of unspecified heart disease,
had undergone surgery for breast cancer in
1969, as already reported (3).
Among the 31 controls, 19 are alive
and 12 died 4 to 23 years after the unique
CA study (Table 3). Three died ofneoplas-
tic disease (one male, age 55, smoker, lung
cancer; one male, age 73, brain tumor; one
female, age 79, nonsmoker, lung adenocar-
cinoma) 13, 14, and 19 years after the CA
study, respectively. Among the controls
were two deaths from car accidents (one
female, age 23; one male, age 50).
As shown in Table 3, the overall age
at death of cases and controls is similar.
However, among the cases the cancer
deaths occurred at younger ages (mean
54.8 vs 69.0), but the difference did not
reach statistical significance.
Cytogenetic Findings andViUl Status
To answer the question of the prognostic
significance for cancer risk of increased CA
in lymphocytes, the results of chromosome
aberration studies of cases and controls
were compared according to vital status
(Table 4). When, as for most exposed sub-
jects, more than one CA study had been
performed, the latter was used. For those
who died of neoplastic disease, the last

cytogenetic study before the diagnosis of
cancer was taken into account.
The CA rates of cases and controls,
either dead or alive, were significantly
different both for cells with chromosome-
type aberrations and for total abnormal
metaphases (p< 0.001) (statistical signifi-
cance not shown in the Table 4).
When considering the cases, those who
died showed significantly higher rates of
CA but not of total abnormal metaphases
than those who are still alive. Those who
died ofcancer presented the highest values.
No such differences, however, were present
among the controls (Table 4). Also, no dif-
ferences were present for hyperdiploid cells
(data not shown).
Discussion
To the best ofmy knowledge, data on long-
term cytogenetic follow-up of subjects
exposed in the past to high concentrations
ofa clastogenic-leukemogenic agent such as
benzene are scanty. The only data are those
of Pollini and Biscaldi (7), who described a
return to normal of rates of aneuploid cells
(mainly hypodiploid) in four subjects who
had been first studied 12 years earlier, at the
time ofbenzene hemopathy.
In our experience, however, increased
rates, as compared to controls, of chromo-
somal abnormalities (mainly structural)
were still present in most cases up to 14 to
18 years after chronic benzene poisoning,
and the findings have been confirmed in
serial examinations (3).
The present data concerning cytoge-
netic reexamination of cultured lympho-
cytes approximately 20 years later in four
subjects recovered from benzene hemopa-
thy again show the persistence of increased
Cu. However, an increase in this type of
aberration compared to the earlier findings
was also present among the controls. This
age effect, which seems common to cases
and controls, might possibly represent
cumulative chromosome damage from
exposure to genotoxic agents or might
depend on a reduced capacity ofrepair (8).
It might be interesting to evaluate whether
this increase correlates with the well-
known increased risk for cancer with aging
in a population.
From the review of the old data plus
the new data of this follow-up, it seems
that, at least for benzene exposure, the
rates of CA are a better indicator of the in
vivo situation than those oftotal abnormal
metaphases, as is the case for exposure to
ionizing radiation (8).
As far as the prognostic significance of
increased CA for cancer risk is concerned,
the follow-up data of the cohort of ben-
zene-exposed subjects and controls, who
differed significantly for CA rates, seem to
indicate a trend toward a higher risk of
neoplasia and a younger age at death from
cancer for subjects recovered from benzene
hemopathy, even though the small num-
bers do not allow a definitive conclusion.
Among the exposed, those who died from
neoplasia were also the ones who had the
highest rates of CA in the last cytogenetic
study before the diagnosis ofcancer.
Two large, ongoing epidemiological
studies, one from Northern Europe (9) and
one from Italy (5), seem to indicate an
approximately double risk of cancer inci-
dence or death, respectively, for the sub-
groups of subjects with high, compared to
those with low, CA levels. The results ofthe
present study, despite the small sample size,
seem in agreement with these conclusions.
Two major points, however, should be
stressed: a) on one hand, this study con-
cerns a group of subjects with exposure to
very high concentrations of benzene, in the
order of hundreds of parts per million,
which had induced in most cases important
signs of toxicity; b) on the other hand, this
study does not take into account the early
deaths from aplastic anemia or leukemia
that were observed at our institute in the
1960s (10).
Further follow-up of this or similar
cohorts is highly desirable. Moreover, the
application in cytogenetic studies ofexposed
and controls, of modern, more sensitive
techniques that might enable a better evalu-
ation of stable or more subtle chromosomal
changes underscored in conventional lym-
phocyte cultures might help answer some
ofthe open questions.
