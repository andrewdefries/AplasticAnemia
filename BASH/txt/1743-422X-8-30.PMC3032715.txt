Abstract
Background: Aplastic anemia (AA) is a serious and rare disorder characterized by a hypocellular bone marrow.
Hepatitis associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is a variant of aplastic anemia in which aplastic anemia follows an
acute attack of hepatitis. Several reports have noted an association between HGV and hepatitis-associated aplastic
anemia besides other hepatitis causing viruses.
Case presentation: A female girl of age 11 year with a history of loose motion for one month, vomiting for last
15 days and poor oral intake for last few days is reported here. The physical examination presents fever, pallor
whereas bleeding, hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly and bruising were absent, abdominal ultrasonography confirmed
the absence of hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly and lymphodenopathy. The laboratory investigation parameters were:
haemoglobin 6.2 g/L, total leucocytes count 1.51, neutrophils 0.47%, absolute reticulocyte count 0.5%, Monocytes
0.16%, red cell count 3.2 mil/uL, Picked cell volume (PCV) 30.13%, Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) 78 fL, Mean
Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) 26.3 pg. The liver enzymes were alanine aminotransferease (ALT) 98 IU/L, aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) 114 IU/L. Serologic and molecular tests for hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, TTV, B19 were negative,
whereas HGV RNA PCR test was found positive for hepatitis G virus. The bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy
examination revealed hypo- cellularity, erythropoiesis, myelopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis.
Conclusion: HAAA is an uncommon but severe condition, which may occur following idiopathic cases of acute
hepatitis. Our finding suggests the involvement of HGV in the development of aplastic anemia. In patients
presenting with pancytopenia after an episode of acute hepatitis, the definitive diagnosis should be considered
and confirmed by RT-PCR and if possible by bone marrow biopsy.
Introduction
Hepatitis G virus was reported first time has a non-A-E
hepatitis and placed as flavivirus [1].The induction of this
new agent in the family of Hepatitis has attracted signifi-
cant attention because of its etiology [2]. Hepatitis G virus
has been marked as a cause of non-A through E acute
viral hepatitis and sharp liver failure. Aplastic anemia com-
plicating hepatitis is an uncommon but well recognized
phenomenon. Hepatitis associated aplastic anemia is a
severe disorder with a high mortality (85%) [3].Hepatitis
associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is a deviation of aplas-
tic anemia in which aplastic anemia follows an acute attack
of hepatitis. The marrow failure can be severe and is
usually lethal if untreated. Lorenz and Quazier has docu-
mented first time HAAA in two case back in 1955 [4], by
1975 more than 193 cases had been reported [5]. Adil et al
has reported, severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) 51.4%, very
severe (VSAA) in 16.7% of 144 patients of aplastic anemia
cases [6]. A number of reports have mentioned alliance
between HGV and HAAA [7-10]. Number of HAAA cases
with a history of multiple blood transfusions has been
reported [11,12]. Crespo et al has documented a case of 24
year old man have community acquired HGV that later
progress into severe aplastic anemia, point out HGV for
both hepatitis and aplastic anaemia. However greater
number of serum samples are needed to prove the associa-
tion of hepatitis G virus and aplastic anaemia [13]. Moatter
et al. has reported 5/43 patients of haemodialysis with
raised liver enzyme, reduced platelet count and 21/100
patients of polytransfused b- thalassemia major children
infected with HGV RNA form Pakistan [14,15].

Case Presentation
In this study well characterized samples of 93 aplastic
anaemia patients before blood tranfusion were included.
These characteristics include history, physical examina-
tion, haematological investigation, bone marrow aspirate
and trephine biopsy examination, liver function test
(LFTs), renal parameters, viral profile and abdominal
ultrasonography. The diagnosis of HA-aplastic anemia
was made on the basis of hepatitis (elevated serum ami-
notransferase enzymes, jaundice, absolute neutrophils
counts, platelet counts and reticulocytes. All the 93 sam-
ples were checked for serological marker of HAV, HBV,
HCV, HDV, HEV, HGV,TTV and B19. One of 93 sam-
ples from patients with HA-aplastic anemia has hepatitis
G associated aplastic anaemia with positive HGV RNA.
A female girl of age 11 year is reported here. The
patient had a history of loose motion for one month,
vomiting for last 15 days and poor oral intake for last
few days. The physical examination presents fever, pallor
whereas bleeding, hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly and
bruising were absent, abdominal ultrasonography con-
firmed the absence of hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly and
lymphodenopathy. The laboratory investigation para-
meters were: haemoglobin 6.2 g/L, total leucocytes
count 1.51, neutrophils 0.47%, absolute reticulocyte
count 0.5%, Monocytes 0.16%, red cell count 3.2 mil/uL,
Picked cell volume (PCV) 30.13%, Mean Corpuscular
Volume (MCV) 78 fL, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin
(MCH) 26.3 pg. The liver enzymes were alanine amino-
transferease (ALT) 98 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) 114 IU/L. Serologic and molecular tests for hepa-
titis A, B, C, D, E, TTV, B19 were negative, whereas
HGV RNA PCR test was found positive for hepatitis G
virus. The bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy
examination revealed hypo- cellularity, erythropoiesis,
myelopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis.
Discussion
Flaviviruses belong to enveloped viruses with a single
positive sence RNA about 10 kb. Hepatitis G virus med-
ium of transmission mostly through blood. The possible
roel of hepatitis G virus infection in the pathogenesis of
rare non-liver disease has been suggested but need to be
recognized. By some unknow reseason aplastic anemia
some time proceded by hepatitis. Few reports have ana-
lysed the role of HGV in the development of HAAA
[8,9,11]. Crespo et al in print a case through negative
serological markes for HAV, HBV, HCV, HEV, hypo-
plastic marrow low platelet and white cell counts but
detected HGV-RNA before any blood transfusion [13].
Byrnes et al has described hepatit G Virus positive case
of 26 year old man before the use of medication, blood
tranfusion or intravenous drug abuse [9]. Zaidi et al,
reported a 19 year male before blood transfusion with
positive HGV by RT-PCR and suggested that in the
absence of any other clincial manifestions the possible
infectious agent may be HGV for hepatitis G virus asso-
ciated aplast anaemia [8]. In the list of studies of Hepa-
titis G Virus associated aplastic anaemia before blood
transfusion we report a case of 11 years female girls.
Whereas some reports confirms the presence of HGV
viraemia in the patient aplastic anaemia after blood
transufion [8,9,11,12,16-18]. But however concluded that
HGV viraemia is frequent in patients with aplastic anae-
mia [19]. Kiem et al reported similar finding after logis-
tic regression analysis, that HGV RNA in transfused
patients was 5.9 times higher compare to untransfused
patients (P = 0.001). This implicates transfusion as
major source of HGV with aplastic anaemia [18].
The published literature point out that studies must
be performed on many more aplastic anaemia patients
prior to blood transfusion [20]. However, to find such
patients in large number are not normally avaible to
study, so far individual cases are reported. The ideal
case regarding Hepatitis G associated aplastic anaemia
are pre blood transfusion.
Conclusion
In conclusion, HAAA is an uncommon but severe con-
dition, which may occur following idiopathic cases of
acute hepatitis. Our finding suggests the involvement of
HGV in the development of aplastic anemia. In patients
presenting with pancytopenia after an episode of acute
hepatitis, the definitive diagnosis should be considered
and confirmed by RT-PCR and if possible by bone mar-
row biopsy.
