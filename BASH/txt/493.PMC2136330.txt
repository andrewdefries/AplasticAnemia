In the course of a survey of the effect of injection of extracts and suspensions
of normal tissues upon body temperature in rabbits (1), it was found that the
intravenous inoculation of suspensions of whole polymorphonuclear leukocytes,
extracts from these cells, or supernatant fluids obtained from sterile peritoneal
exudates containing granulocytes produced febrile responses in normal rabbits.
The present report describes experiments designed to characterize the agent
or agents responsible for the rise of body temperature.
Materials and Methods
Rabbit lenkocytes were collected from peritoneal exudates after infusion of physiologic
saline as described in the preceding paper. A standard procedure was adopted for preparing
suspensions and extracts of the cells collected. After separation of the cells and supernatant
fluid of an exudate, the leukocytes were centrifuged in calibrated 15 ml. tubes at 2000
R.P.-. for 30 minutes and the packed cell volume was recorded. The ceils were then ground
with physiologic saline in a TenBroeck grinder, the debris was separated by centrifugation,
and the supematant extract was diluted with physiologic saline solution to a volume cor-
responding to 10 ml. for each 1 ml. of leukocytes. Two ml. of such an extract, corresponding
to 0.2 ml. of leukocytes (roughly 400 million cells), injected intravenously into a normal
rabbit produced approximately the same temperature response that followed injection of
10 ml. of supematant fluid from the original exudate. In this manner an extratt and a
supernatan~fluid from each exudate obtained were prepared and stored at 4°C.
Testing and recording of temperatures were carried out in normal rabbits as described
in Paper I, and strict precautions against contamination with bacterial pyrogen were ob-
served throughout (1). Thorotrast, nitrogen mustard, heparin, sodium citrate, physiologic
saline, and enzyme preparations were injected intravenously into rabbits and demonstrated
to be non-pyrogenic before use.

suction, pooled, centrifuged again at 2000 ~.P.~. for 30 minutes in 40 ml. tubes, and the
leukocyte layers were again removed and placed in a 15 ml. calibrated centrifuge tube. After
centrifugation at 2000 R.P.M. for 30 minutes, the volume of leukocytes recovered was found
to be about 5 mL Because of firm agglutination of the cells, accurate total leukocyte counts
were not possible but stained smears revealed more than 75 per cent polymorphonuclcar
leukocytes. This material was ground in a TenBroeck grinder and the extract obtained was
diluted to 50 ml., the equivalent of 10 ml. for each 1 ml. of huffy coat material. The cellular
debris was resuspended in 50 ml. of physiologic saline.
Two ml. doses of the cellular extract were injected intravenously into 6 normal rabbits.
Febrile responses, similar to those obtained with leukecytes from peritoneal exudate, were
elicited. Heating at 90°C. for 30 minutes inactivated the extract. Injection of the suspension
of cellular debris did not affect the body temperature of normal rabbits. It should be men-
I. L. BENNETT~ JR.~ AND P. B. BEESON 495
tioned that in testing extracts prepared from bully coat material, sudden death occasionally
followed intravenous injections in rabbits; this couid be prevented by premedication with
heparin or by giving small "desensitizing" doses beforehand (2).
An extract of 6 ml. of buffy coat material was prepared from 1500 mi. of whole blood
obtained from 11 normalrabbits using 3.8 per cent sodium citrate solutionas an anticoagulant.
This was also potent in producing fever and was inactivated by heating at 90°C. for 30 min-
utes. Fig. 1 shows the results of two typical experiments with extracts of leukocytes from
heparinized and from citrated whole blood.
These results indicate that the presence of a fever-producing substance is
not peculiar to the granulocytes of an induced peritoneal exudate. Furthermore,
they suggest that the fever produced by injection of the supernatant fluids
from exudates may be due to presence of material originating in the leukocytes
of the exudate.
Effect of Polymorpkonuclear Leukocytes Collectedfrom PleuraI Exudates.--
Over a period of 3 hours, 50 ml. of physiologic saline solution was infused by slow drip
into the fight pleural cavities of 2 normal rabbits. Four hours after completionof the infusion,
both animals were sacrificed by intravenous injection of nembutal, the chests were opened,
and all fluid was removed by gentle suction. The pooled exudates totaled 45 ml. containing
4,800 polymorphonudear cells per ram.8 Ten ml. portions of the supernatant fluid were in-
jected into 3 normal rabbits and produced typical febfile responses. An extract prepared
by grinding the leukocytes of the exudate in 2 ml. of physiologic saline produced fever in
a normal rabbit. The supernatant fluid heated at 90°C. for 30 minutes was not pyrogeuic for
a normal rabbit.
These results indicate that the presence of fever-producing material in
exudates is not limited to inflammations of the peritoneum.
Heat Stability.--Boiling for 10 minutes or heating at 90°C. for 30 minutes
destroyed the fever-producing capacity of leukocyte extracts or supematant
fluids from peritoneal exudates. A more detailed study of the effects of heating
was undertaken.
DupLicate 10 hal. samples of the supematant fluid and 2 ml. samples of leukocyte extract
from an exudate were heated in a water bath for 30 minutes at 56, 65, 70, 80, 85, and 90°C.
Two samples of supernatant fluid and of extract were exposed at each temperature and
injected intravenously into normal rabbits. The fever-producing property of the extract
disappeared from samples heated to 70° or higher, whereas samples of supernatant fluid con-
tinued to cause febrile reactions even after exposure to ~5°. Heating at 90°, however, effec-
tively destroyed the fever-promoting factor in these. The experiment was repeated with
another exudate, and similar results were obtained.
These findings suggested the possibility that there might be different fever-
producing substances in the extracts and supernatant fluids of peritoneal
exudates. However, since leukocyte extracts prepared in the manner described
above were found to have a pH of 4.5-5.0 while the supernatant exudate
fluids showed a pH of 7.2-7.4, it seemed possible that the difference in heat
stability might be due only to this factor.
495 PATHOGENESIS O1~ lcEV-ER. II
Extracts were adjusted to pH 7.2 and supematant fluids to pH 4.5 using phosphate-
buffered saline and samples were tested after heating. At pH 7.2, the leukocyte extract re-
mained stable at 70°C., the fever-producing capacity disappearing between 85 and 90°C.
At pH 4.5, supernatant fluids lost potency after heating for 30 minutes at 70°C.
On the basis of these findings, it was concluded that the fever-producing
materials in the extracts and supernatant fluids were similar in heat stability.
Effect of pH.--Extracts and supernatant fluids retained potency over a
pH range from 2.0 to 10.5. There was no evidence of a gradual lessening of
febrile response with increasing alkalinity or acidity within this range.
Stability at 37 and 4°C.--Incubation at 37°C. for 24 hours or storage for as
long as 6 months at 4°C. had no detectable effect upon the ability of extracts
or supernatant fluids to cause fever in normal rabbits.
Dia2ysis.--After dialysis through cellophane against distilled water or
physiologic saline for as long as 5 days, with frequent changing of the bath,
the fever-producing material was found to remain within the cellophane
bag.
Protein and Polysaccharide Content.--
Analysisby a modificationof the biuret method of Gornall etaL (3) of leukocyte extracts
and supernatant fluidsx revealed a total protein content of 38 to 51 rag. per 100 ml. for
leukocyte extracts and 389 to 511 nag. per 100 ml. for supematant exudate fluids. Total
polysaccharide, determined by a modification of the anthrone method (4), was 1.7 to 3.0
nag. per 100 ml. (calculated against a glucosestandard) for extracts and 2.7 to 4.2 rag. per
100 ml. for supernatant fluids.
On the basis of these determinations it can be stated that a quantity of
leukocyte extract (2 mi.) sufficient to cause a sharp febrile response in a rabbit
contained a total of 0.76 rag. of protein and 0.054 nag. of polysaccharide.
Effect of Proteolytic Enzymes.--The fever-producing effect of leukocyte
extracts and supernatant fluids was unimpaired by incubation for 18 hours
at 370C. with crystalline trypsin, chymotrypsin, or ribonuclease3 Furthermore,
treatment with trypsin did not cause the active material to become dialyzable.
The effect of amylases was not determined because of inability to obtain
preparations of these enzymes which were not pyrogenic, presumably due to
contamination by bacterial products.
Electropkoretic Pattern.--Supernatant fluids were concentrated to one-fifth
their original volume by dialysis against 12 per cent dextran. This was done
in order to facilitate electrophoretic analysis, and did not cause reduction of
potency in producing fever. Paper electrophoresis3 revealed patterns like the
pattern of normal rabbit serum.

natant fluid and 2 ml. samples of leukocyte extract were incubated with 10
ml. of normal rabbit plasma at 37°C. for 30 minutes. Control samples of super-
natant fluid and of extract diluted with physiologic saline were also incubated.
Injection of these preparations into normal animals resulted in comparable
febrile responses, there being no evidence of modification of the potency of
supematant fluid or leukocyte extracts by normal rabbit plasma. This experi-
ment was repeated with supematant fluid and leukocyte extract from another
exudate, the period of incubation in this instance being 18 hours. Again, the
febrile response was not modified by the procedure. Similar experiments
employing rabbit plasma which had been heated at 56°C. for 30 minutes before
mixing with material from peritoneal exudates failed to give any evidence of
presence of a plasma activator or inhibitor.
Comparison of the Fever Produced by Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes, by
Bacterial Pyrogens,and by Menkin's Pyrexin.--Menkin has described pyrex[n,
a material associated with the euglobulin fraction of sterile exudates, which
produces fever when injected intravenously into rabbits (5, 6). As mentioned
in the accompanying paper (1), one criticism of Menk]n's conclusion that
pyrexin is responsible for the febrile reaction accompanying acute inflammation
is his omission of adequate precautions against extraneous contamination by
bacterial pyrogen during the process of separation of his material from exu-
dates. According to Menkin, the potency of pyrexin is not impaired by boiling.
It has the further property of producing profound leukopenia within a few
minutes after injection. Both of these findings are strongly suggestive of bac-
terial pyrogen (7). A series of experiments were therefore undertaken in which
the properties of leukocyte extracts and supematant fluids from peritoneal
exudates were compared with pyrexin and with known bacterial pyrogens.
The bacterial pyrogens employed were piromen, a purified material from Pseudo-
monas,4and a triple typhoid vaccine containing 1 billion organisms per ml.s Through
the kindness of Dr. Menkin, approximately 80 rag. of purified pyrexin (lot 235-T
of 9-17-52) was made available to us. This material was found to produce brisk
fevers in rabbits when injected in a dose of 0.25 rag. suspended in physiologic saline,
and this dosage was employed throughout the study. The fever-producing effect of
pyrexin was found to be unimpaired by boiling for 10 minutes, in contrast to the
heat lability of leukocyte extracts already described.

a single injection of 2 ml. of leukocyte extract, 0.25 mg. of pyrexin, or 0.125 ml. of

tracts or supematant fluids were remarkably uniform in pattern. Within 12 to 18
minutes there was an abrupt rise to a peak at 1 to 2 hours with a prompt fall to the

baseline by 3 ~ to 4 hours. In more than 350 observations, we have never seen a
secondary rise after a single injection. This fever curve differed, then, in three respects
from that following injection of pyrexin or bacterial pyrogen: the rise began earlier,
I. L. BENNETT, ~R., AND P. B. BEESON 499
the duration of fever was shorter, and secondary elevations were not observed. The
similarity of fever curves in rabbits after injection of bacterial pyrogens and pyrexin
has been previously pointed out by Grant (8). With repeated injections of leukocyte
extract, a series of identical peaks has been obtained as illustrated in Fig. 3 but the
duration of fever from a single injection is not prolonged. Increasing the amount of
extract injected may increase the height of the febrile response but the duration is
little affected.
(b) Test for Devdopment of Tolerance and Its Abolition by Thorotrast.--Rabbits
given daily injections of the same dose of bacterial pyrogen rapidly develop tolerance
to the fever-producingeffect; successive fevers diminishprogressively until a "minimal
response" is reached after about 1 week (9, 10). Injection of thorotrast or other
colloidal materials abruptly abolishes this acquired resistance and animals so treated
react to pyrogen with fevers as great or greater than those following the first injection
of pyrogen (11). The effects of repeated injections of supernatant fluidfrom peritoneal
exudates and of pyrexin were therefore compared in the following experiment.
Two rabbits were given daily intravenous injections of 0.25 mg. pyrexin in 0.5 ml. of
physiologic saline for 9 days; temperatures were recorded for 5 hours after injection on the
1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th days. Another pair of animals received daily intravenous injec-
tions of 10 nil. of supernatant fluid from pooled exudate, their fever curves also being meas-
ured on the same days. On the afternoon of the 9th day, all animals were given 6.0 ml. of
thorotrast (Heyden) and injections of pyrexin or supernatant fluid were repeated on the
10th day, 16 hours after thorotrast. In order to facilitate comparison of febrile responses
from day to day, they were plotted on 2.5 ram. graph paper, and the area under each tem-
perature curve was measured with a planimeter,e the vernier reading being recorded as the
"fever index," an expressionof both height and duration of fever (9).
As can be seen in Fig. 4, the febrile response to 0.25 rag. of pyrexin decreased
rapidly with successive injections. After injection of thorotrast, however, both ani-
mals reacted to pyrexin with higher fevers than did those following the first injection
of this material. In striking contrast, the animals given daily injectionsof supematant
exudate fluid reacted to successive doses with approximately the same fever, and
injection of thorotrast failed to modify this reaction. This experiment was repeated
with two groups of three animals, with similar results.
(c) Cross-Tolerance to Bacterial Pyrogen~.--Rabbits made tolerant by repeated
injections of bacterial pyrogen derived from a single species are also resistant to the
fever-producing effect of pyrogens of other bacterial species (9, 10, 12, 13). It was of
interest, therefore, to test the effect of leukocyte extracts and of pyrexin in animals
rendered tolerant to bacterial pyrogens.
Two rabbits were given 0.25 rag. of pyrexin in 0.5 nil. of physiologicsaline intravenously
and temperatures were recorded for 5 hours after injection; their fever indices were 25 and
36. On the 2rid day, the animals were injected with 0.125 ml. of typhoid vaccine; this re-
suited in fever indices of 53 and 41. Daily injections of typhoid vaccine were then con-
tinued until the 8th day when temperatures were again recorded giving indices of 10.5 and
9, indicating tolerance to the typhoid pyrogen. On the 9th day, pyrexin was again injected;

both animals reacted with mild fevers, the indices being 14 and 12.5, considerably lower
than those recorded on day 1. On the afternoon of the 9th day, the rabbits were given 6.0

(d) E.ffe~tupon Circulating Leukocytea.--In th~ study no observations were made
regarding the effect of pyrexin upon circulating leukocytes. Menkin, however, has
described leukopenia followed by leukocytosis after injection of some preparations
(5, 6). This is, of course, a characteristic response to injection of bacterial pyrogens
and has even been suggested as a test for their presence (7). Weisberger e~a/. (14)
have reported that the injection of suspensions of polymorphonudear leukocytes is
followed by leukopenia in rabbits. Our findings with whole cell suspensions were in
accord with this. However, the injection of leukocyte extract or the supernatant
fluid of peritoneal exudates produced no consistent change in the number of circulating
leukocytes, although with some preparations a mild tendency to leukopenia during
the first 2 hours after injection was noted. Weisberger ~ aL noted leukopenia after

injection of leukocyte extracts. The difference in our findings may be a matter of
dosage but it should be pointed out that Weisberger et al. did not take precautions
against contamination with bacterial pyrogens. Table I showsthe effects of leukocyte

Effect of Amidopyrine.--Four rabbits were given 10 ml. of supernatant fluid
and 4 received 2 ml. of leukocyte extract from the same exudate. Two animals
in each group were given 0.5 gm. of a suspension of amidopyrine subcutaneously
1 hour before and 1 hour after injection of the leukocyte materials. Untreated
animals showed typical febrile responses while those given amidopyrine

I. L. BENNETT, ~R., AND P. B. BEESON 505
Twelve rabbits were given 5 rag. of HN~s intravenously and 4 days later,
saline peritoneal exudates were prepared in the usual way. The cellular response,
detailed in Table HI, was scant in all animals and in many instances; no poly-
morphonuclear leukocytes were present in the abdominal fluids. However,
the injection of 10 ml. of supernatant fluid from these exudates into normal
rabbits was followed in every instance by typical febrile responses, examples
of which are shown in Fig. 7. The ability of these fluids to cause fever was
destroyed by heating at 90°C. for 30 minutes and was uninfluenced by dialysis
or digestion with proteolytic enzymes. This experiment was repeated, using
9 animals, and again it was found that peritoneal fluids contained a fever-
producing substance, even in the absence of granulocytes in the exudates or in
the peripheral circulation.
DISCUSSION
The evidence furniched by these further studies on the production of
fever by the components of peritoneal exudates in rabbits indicates that the
fever-producing substances contained in polymorphonuclear leukocyte
extracts and supernatant fluids are closely related. Conclusive evidence of
identity must await chemical definition but the properties thus far studied
have been common to both. Neither is dialyzable, even after tryptic diges-
tion. There is no impairment of potency by trypsin, chymotrypsin, or ribo-
undease. At pH 7.2, the pyrogenic activity of extracts and supernatant fluids
is lost by heating at 90°C. for 30 minutes; at pH 4.5, potency disappears at
70°C. Both preparations retain their activity over a pH range from 2 to 10.5.
The fever curves of normal rabbits after injection of whole leukocytes, leuko-
cyte extract, or supernatant peritoneal fluid are the same in time of onset,
height, shape, and duration.
It is hoped that the chemical nature of the pyrogenic factor can be defined
more precisely, although the problems of obtaining large amounts of material
and the necessity that all manipulations be carried out with techniques which
avoid contamination with bacterial pyrogen offer severe handicaps. Also the
process of identification is tedious because the only method now available for
detection of activity is test of effect upon the body temperature of experi-
mental animals.
That the presence of fever-promoting material in peritoneal exudates is
not determined by some influence peculiar to the abdominal cavity is estab-
lished by the demonstration of similar activity in pleural fluids. Furthermore,
extracts of acute localized skin inflammations contain a heat-labile pyro-
genic material (1).
Although the finding of febrile responses after injection of peritoneal
fluids from HN~-treated animals, containing no leuko.cytes, suggests strongly

506 PATHOGEIqESIS OF ~I~VER. IX
that the polymorphonuclear leukocyte is not the only source of fever-
producing material, the demonstration of such a substance in extracts of
polymorphonuclear leukocytes collected from the peripheral blood justifies the
assignment of an important role to this cell.
The experiments in which the effects of leukocyte extracts and Menkin's
pyrex'in were compared demonstrated important differences in these two
substances. The heat-lability of leukocyte extracts, the short, monophasie
febrile response following a single injection, the failure of animals to de-
velop tolerance to repeated injections, the lack of potentiation of the response
in thorotrast-treated rabbits, and the absence of evidence of cross-toler-
ance in animals resistant to bacterial pyrogens are all in striking contrast
to the findings with pyrexin. Pyrexin resists boiling, the fever following its
injection is prolonged and is often biphasic, animals acquire tolerance to
its fever-producing effect when given repeated injections, a resistance which
is abolished by thorotrast, and animals resistant to bacterial pyrogens show
greatly decreased fevers after injection of pyrexin. While it is entirely possible
that pyrexin is a product of injured ceils having properties similar to those
of pyrogenic bacterial endotoxins, the possibility that contamination with
bacterial products is responsible for these findings must be taken seriously.
Certainly, the present results justify the conclnsion that leukocyte extracts
contain some substance other than pyrexin which causes fever. In this con-
nection, it may be pointed out that turpentine-induced pleural exudates
in dogs, of the type used by Menkin as a source of pyrex.in, were found by
Bennett (16) to produce fever in rabbits and dogs when injected intrave-
nously. Bacterial pyrogen contamination was avoided in his experiments
and it was demonstrated that animals did not become tolerant to exudates
with repeated injections and that resistance to bacterial pyrogens conferred
no protection against the production of fever by pleural exudates. Further-
more, the febrile response to a single injection of pleural fluid in rabbits was
of short duration, resembling closely the fevers after injection of leukocyte
extracts and peritoneal fluids described in the present report. It seems pos-
sible, indeed probable to us, therefore, that the activity observed by Menkin
in the exudates from which he extracts pyrexin is due to the same substance
or substances that we are attempting to characterize.
Menkin's suggestion that pyrexin is the cause of fever in inflammatory
states is not easily reconciled with the fact that the animal body rapidly
develops a tolerance to its fever-producing effect. The occurrence of long
continued fever with inflammation might be explained as due to liberation
of increasing quantities of the material, but there is seldom any reason to
believe this to be the case; furthermore there is experimental evidence indi-
cating that recovery from most infections takes place without the develop-
ment of increased resistance to bacterial pyrogens (10, 17). Relapses and
I. L. BENNETT, JR., AND P. B. BEESON 507
secondary infections are likely to be accompanied by fever; indeed recurrence
of fever is usually the signal of such complications.
It is tempting to speculate upon the possible role of a fever-producing
substance from polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the fever accompanying
various disease states. Leukocytic infiltration at inflammatory sites and the
occurrence of peripheral leukocytosis in many febrile disorders might signify
a possible relationship. In diseases accompanied by normal peripheral leuko-
cyte counts or leukopenia, the actual turnover of leukocytes is unknown.
Certainly, fever in patients with agranulocytosis or aplastic anemia cannot
be attributed to a product of leukocytes, and experiments in rabbits given
HN2 suggest that sources of fever-promoting substances other than granu-
locytes exist in the animal body.
SUMM~Ry
Further studies on fever production by injection of leukocyte extracts
or cell-free supernatant fluids from peritoneal exudates in rabbits are re-
ported.
Granulocytes collected from peripheral blood or from pleural exudates
contain a heat-labile pyrogenic substance.
The material in extracts of leukocytes and in peritoneal fluids, which causes
fever, is destroyed by heating for 30 minutes at 90°C. at pH 7.2 and at 70°C.
at pH 4.5. It is active in producing fever over a pH range of 2.0 to 10.5 and
maintains potency for as long as 6 months at 4°C.
The fever-producing substance in leukocyte extracts is not dialyzable.
Its activity is not destroyed by trypsin, chymotrypsin, or ribonuclease. No
evidence of plasma activator or inhibitor was detected.
Significant temperature elevation in the rabbit was effected by a quantity
of leukocyte extract containing 0.76 nag. protein and 0.054 rag. polysac-
charide.
The febrile response produced by the material under study was compared
with that of Menkin's pyrexin as well as with that of bacterial pyrogens.
Several significant differences were noted. The properties of pyrexin are
similar to those of bacterial pyrogens.
Amidopyrine suppressed the febrile response to injection of leukocyte
extracts, whereas neither amidopyrine nor cortisone influenced the appear-
ance of pyrogenic material in induced peritoneal exudates.
Peritoneal fluids collected from rabbits made leukopenic by HN~ were
found to contain a fever-promoting substance. Its character has yet to be
determined.
It is concluded that there is present in polymorphonuclear leukocytes of
rabbits a heat-labile factor capable of producing fever in rabbits and that
the leukocyte is probably not the only source of such a factor.
