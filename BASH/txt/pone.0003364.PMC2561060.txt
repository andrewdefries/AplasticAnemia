Abstract
Although it is clear that telomerase expression is crucial for the maintenance of telomere homeostasis, there is increasing
evidence that the TERT protein can have physiological roles that are independent of this central function. To further
examine the role of telomerase during vertebrate development, the zebrafish telomerase reverse transcriptase (zTERT) was
functionally characterized. Upon zTERT knockdown, zebrafish embryos show reduced telomerase activity and are viable, but
develop pancytopenia resulting from aberrant hematopoiesis. The blood cell counts in TERT-depleted zebrafish embryos are
markedly decreased and hematopoietic cell differentiation is impaired, whereas other somatic lineages remain
morphologically unaffected. Although both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis is disrupted by zTERT knockdown, the
telomere lengths are not significantly altered throughout early development. Induced p53 deficiency, as well as
overexpression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and E1B-19K, significantly relieves the decreased blood cells numbers
caused by zTERT knockdown, but not the impaired blood cell differentiation. Surprisingly, only the reverse transcriptase
motifs of zTERT are crucial, but the telomerase RNA-binding domain of zTERT is not required, for rescuing complete
hematopoiesis. This is therefore the first demonstration of a non-canonical catalytic activity of TERT, which is different from
‘‘authentic’’ telomerase activity, is required for during vertebrate hematopoiesis. On the other hand, zTERT deficiency
induced a defect in hematopoiesis through a potent and specific effect on the gene expression of key regulators in the
absence of telomere dysfunction. These results suggest that TERT non-canonically functions in hematopoietic cell
differentiation and survival in vertebrates, independently of its role in telomere homeostasis. The data also provide insights
into a non-canonical pathway by which TERT functions to modulate specification of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells
during vertebrate development. (276 words)

Introduction
Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex required for the
synthesis of telomere terminal repeats. The essential components
required for this activity are telomerase reverse transcriptase
(TERT), the catalytic component, and telomerase RNA (TR) (or
TERC; telomerase RNA component) which is the template for
DNA repeat synthesis [1,2]. Telomerase elongates telomeres and
protects chromosome ends from recombination and fusion, and the
loss of this enzyme can trigger cellular DNA damage responses in
both the presence and absence of altered telomere integrity
[1,3,4,5]. The TERT protein is well conserved evolutionarily and
has now been characterized with regard to its functional motifs and
domains [6,7] (Figure S1, Figure S2A). The reverse transcriptase
(RT) motifs are essential for the enzymatic activity of TERT in
synthesizing telomere repeats and also play an important role in
nucleotide addition and processivity in concert with its C-terminal
domain [8,9]. With respect to the physical interaction between
TERT and TR in vitro, the RT domain of TERT appears to be
dispensable [6,7,10]. Instead, the RNA-binding domains of TERT
interact with TR to facilitate the elongation of the telomere repeats
via the catalytic activity of the RT domain [11,12,13,14,15]. Hence,
both the TR binding and RT domains of TERT must act in concert
for the synthesis of telomere repeats [13].
Telomerase activity is detectable at different levels in various
cell types and correlates with their proliferative potential [16,17].

In higher vertebrates including humans, telomerase expression is
dynamically and precisely regulated in normal somatic tissues, but
is constitutively expressed in most cancer cells and long-lived self-
renewing cells such as stem cells [18,19]. Interestingly, rodents and
lower vertebrates have relatively loosely regulated or even
constitutive telomerase activity in their somatic cells
[20,21,22,23,24]. The biological significance of ‘tight’ versus
‘loose’ regulation of TERT expression in different vertebrates
may be associated with the differing stem cell functions,
regenerative abilities, and cancer predisposition in various species
[25,26,27,28,29,30]. However, links between TERT and cellular
functions that govern the relationship between telomerase activity,
telomere structure, and telomere length have not been elucidated
extensively in lower vertebrates, including zebrafish, until recently
[22,31,32,33,34].
Although it is now clear that telomerase expression is crucial for the
maintenance of telomere homeostasis, there is increasing evidence
that the TERT protein can have physiological roles that are
independent of this central function [5,25,29,35,36,37,38,39,40]. In
tumor-derived cells, TERT promotes tumor development, even if the
cells possess telomeres of ample length [38]. This observation implies
that TERT has at least one function that is distinct from telomere
maintenance during tumorigenesis. Mice have long telomeres and
telomere shortening is not an actual barrier to cellular transformation
in the absence of TR [41]. Yet in transgenic mice, TERT
overexpression promotes stem cell mobilization, hair growth, and
stem cell proliferation in the absence of changes in telomere length,
and this can occur both dependently and independently of TR
expression [27,29]. Moreover, ablation of human TERT (hTERT)
expression affects the overall configuration of chromatin, and
abrogates the cellular response to DNA double strand breaks,
without altering telomere integrity [5]. These results support the
notion that TERT may have non-canonical functions, although the
underlying mechanisms by which TERT operates in this way remain
unclear.
Genetically engineered mice lacking TR are viable, but telomere
loss and increased end-to-end fusions have been reported in later
generations [17]. The phenotypes associated with telomere
dysfunction include neural tube defects, severe intestinal atrophy,
reduced angiogenic potential, and reduced proliferative potential of
the bone marrow stem cells [42]. Furthermore, TERT-deficient
mice have also been generated [43,44], and active telomerase in
these animals appears to be critical for telomere maintenance as
obvious telomere shortening was evident in comparably later
generations [43,45,46]. In contrast, Chiang et al. [47] have reported
that mTERT+/2
heterozygotes had no detectable defects in telomere
elongation compared with wild-type controls. In addition, Yuan et
al. [44] previously observed that there were no significant changes in
G-strand 59-overhangs between mTERT+/+
, mTERT+/2
, and
mTERT2/2
mice, at least in the early generation progeny.
In humans, heterozygous mutations of the human TR (hTR)
gene have been described in patients with acquired aplastic
anemia and the autosomal dominant form of dyskeratosis
congenita. Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare skin and bone marrow
failure syndrome caused by defective telomere maintenance in
hematopoietic stem cells [48]. More recently, heterozygous
mutations have also been identified in hTERT among aplastic
anemia patients [49]. These results suggest that partially impaired
telomerase activity arising from a haploinsufficiency might induce
bone marrow failure in humans. Mice deficient in the telomerase
gene products are well established and potentially very good
models to study the pathogenesis of telomerase-related bone
marrow failure, as already reported [50]. However, the choice of
animal model remains one of the most important issues for a
variety of experimental approaches to the study of telomerase. In
addition, given the possibility that mice models may not
recapitulate all of the phenotypes of human bone marrow failure
patients, it will also be important to examine the function of
telomerase in other animal models.
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an excellent vertebrate model for studying
developmental hematopoiesis [51]. The embryos of this fish are
transparent and develop rapidly ex-utero, thus allowing for easy
observation of multiple organs, including the vasculature and the
relative number and color of circulating blood cells. Zebrafish
orthologs for genes expressed in many mammalian blood cell types
have also been identified [52,53]. Moreover, a number of zebrafish
mutants have now been developed as models for human
hematopoietic diseases, such as congenital dyserythropoietic
anemia, sideroblastic anemia, hepatoerythropoietic porphyria,
hemochromatosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
[54,55,56]. Although the critical roles of telomerase in hematopoi-
etic cells have been documented extensively in the literature [57,58],
little is known about the functional involvement of TERT in the
molecular programming of embryonic hematopoiesis in vertebrates.
In our current study, we have isolated zebrafish TERT (zTERT)
and characterized its functional roles in hematopoiesis during early
development. We show that zTERT knockdown causes hypochro-
mic anemia at the onset of circulation, and that this is accompanied
by the impaired differentiation of blood cells and their eventual
apoptotic cell death leading to a severe reduction of hematopoietic
cells (‘pancytopenia’), during embryogenesis. The phenotypes
resulting from zTERT deficiency bear many of the hallmarks of
MDS, rather than of aplastic anemia. In addition, although
peripheral blood cytopenia was observed, we also detected dysplasia
of blood cell development during hematopoiesis. Based on the
alterations of hematopoietic cell differentiation markers, TERT
deficiency in zebrafish may cause differentiation and maturation
failure in both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis. The
cytopenic phenotype, but not impaired differentiation, in the
zTERT-deficient embryos is significantly reduced by the loss of p53
as well as by the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and
E1B-19K. Intriguingly, the effects observed in zTERT deficient
embryos appear to be independent of the telomere maintenance
function of telomerase, and can be compensated by the overex-
pression of a telomerase activity-negative deletion mutant of
zTERT lacking the TR-binding domain. Taken together, our
results demonstrate for the first time that zTERT promotes the
development of hematopoietic cells through a non-canonical
mechanism that is independent of the authentic telomerase activity
of TERT and the role of this enzyme in telomere lengthening. Our
zebrafish model should therefore provide new platforms with which
to examine novel TERT functions and pathways related to human
hematopoietic disorders.
Results
Induction of apoptosis, but not telomere shortening, by
the ablation of TERT in zebrafish embryos
Sequence analysis and comparisons have confirmed a high
degree of homology between the functional domains of zTERT
and human TERT (hTERT). The N-terminus, TR-binding site,
and RT motifs are the most highly conserved regions. The zTERT
protein shows approximately 50% identity with its hTERT
counterpart within these functional domains, but exhibits only a
22% identity outside these regions. Importantly, the metal-binding
motifs in RT motifs A and C of TERT, which are responsible for
the two-metal mechanism underlying its catalytic activity, are
conserved in zTERT (Figure S1). In addition, the overall primary

structure of zTERT, based on its amino acid sequence, has a high
degree of homology to that of human, mouse, chicken, Xenopus,
and Fugu TERT (Figure S1, Figure S2). zTERT is also
significantly expressed during early development and also in
multiple tissues in adult fish (Figure S3) [23].
To analyze the functional roles of the TERT protein during
vertebrate development, we performed knockdown analysis of the
zTERT gene. To this end, we designed a morpholino antisense
oligonucleotide (MO) targeting the translation initiation codon
and 59-UT region of the zTERT gene to block translation of
zTERT mRNA (zTERT-MO1), and injected this MO into
zebrafish embryos at the 1–2-cell stage. As an antibody that
specifically recognizes or cross-reacts with the zTERT protein is
not currently available, we generated a construct containing the
translational initiation site of zTERT fused with green fluorescent
protein (GFP) as a transgene (in mimicry of zTERT) for
introduction into zebrafish embryos to demonstrate that our
zTERT-MO1 works in vivo (Figure S4A). The resulting
transgenic embryos allowed us to monitor the suppression of
extrinsic mimic zTERT (zTERT-GFP) expression by MO1
through the analysis of the GFP expression levels (Figure 1A,
a–d, Figure S4B). We also performed western blot analysis using
an anti-GFP antibody to detect the expression of the zTERT-GFP
protein, and its reduction by zTERT-MO1 but not Cont-MO1
(Figure 1A, f, g).
We next determined whether zTERT-MO1 inhibits telomerase
activity in vivo using the standard telomere repeat amplification
protocol (TRAP) assay. A decrease in telomerase activity by this
MO was found to be dose-dependent, as revealed by injection of
1.6 to 8 ng/embryo (Figure 1B, a; TRAP-ELISA assay).
Figures 1B, b (TRAP-gel loading assay), c (Fluorometric TRAP
assay) show the enzymatic activity of telomerase in lysates from 12,
24, 48 and 72 hours post fertilization (hpf) embryos. At each point
over this time course, more decreases in activity with time were
Figure 1. The knockdown of TERT in the zebrafish embryo does not result in telomere shortening. (A) A zTERT-MO1-induced
translational block was monitored using mini-zTERT-GFP (zTERT-GFP) in vivo. To test the effectiveness of the MO1 in binding the transcript and
inhibiting downstream translation, a GFP reporter construct driven by a DNA sequence upstream from the zTERT coding region (encompassing the
zTERT-MO1 target region) was used. Representative GFP expression profiles are shown for embryos (24 hpf) injected with Cont-MO1 and GFP empty
vector (a), Cont-MO1 and zTERT-GFP (b), zTERT-MO1 and GFP empty vector (c), and zTERT-MO1 and zTERT-GFP (d). (e) Quantification of the GFP
intensity in embryos injected with a combination of MOs (Cont-MO1 or zTERT-MO1) and plasmids (GFP or zTERT-GFP) as shown in Figure 1A. Five
independent experiments incorporating more than 50 embryos in each instance were performed. *

indicating the insertion of an intact intron between exons 5 and 6 was almost predominantly observed in samples injected with 8 ng MO2 (48 hpf). In
contrast, the 677 bp intact band was almost undetectable in these same morphants. (B) Quantitative analysis of telomerase activity in zTERT

detectable after the injection of zTERT-MO1 (8 ng/embryo). In
contrast, injections of two types of control MOs (a 5-base
mismatch MO1 as the Cont-MO1 and an inverse-sequence
MO1 for the sequence of zTERT-MO1) had no significant effects
on telomerase activity (Figure 1B, b, c; not shown for the
inverse-sequence MO1).
An additional zTERT-specific MO (zTERT-MO2) was also
designed that creates aberrant splicing between exon 5 and exon 6
of this gene (Figure S4B). RT-PCR and DNA sequencing results
showed that the intron between exon 5 and exon 6 was not
skipped out during splicing in MO2-injected embryos (Figure 1A,
h). More specifically, integration of this intact intron created an in-
frame premature stop codon (TGA), resulting in a truncated
protein lacking most of the reverse transcriptase domain (termed
motifs A, B’, C, D, and E, and further carboxyl-terminal end
region) (Figure S4B, see also the zTERT structure in Figure S1,
Figure S2A). Hence, this splice-blocking MO2 successfully
generated a telomerase activity-defective zTERT product
(Figure 1B, d–f), as measured by the three different types of
the TRAP assay methods.
We next measured the telomere lengths in zebrafish embryos by
whole-mount quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (WM-
Q-FISH). TERT-deficient and control embryos at 24 hpf were
hybridized with a Cy3-labeled peptide nucleic acid (PNA)
telomere-specific probe as described in the Materials and Methods
[59,60]. Telomere speckles in interphase nuclei can be easily
visualized and quantified by WM-Q-FISH throughout the body of
the test animals. Magnified images of these speckles were then
used to quantify the relative telomere lengths. We compared
zTERT morphants and control animals by measuring the
telomere lengths in the eyes, brains, and muscles of the injected
embryos by WM-Q-FISH. No decrease in the telomere lengths
was detectable in any of these tissues at 24–72 hpf after injection of
zTERT-MO1 or zTERT-MO2 (data not shown). Moreover, we
performed metaphase chromosome spreading to enable telomere
FISH (Figure S5A, B), in addition to the originally performed
interphase telomere FISH. We then compared not only average
telomere lengths, but also determined the number of critically
short telomeres and signal-free telomere ends. We found
populations of cells that exhibited no critical telomere shortening,
and there were no statistically significant differences between the
corresponding low fluorescent signals from either the MO1- or
MO2-injected embryos when compared with the controls (Figure
S5B). These findings significantly reduced the likelihood that short
telomeres play any role in propagating the cell fate abnormalities
that we observe in the TERT-knockdown zebrafish embryos.
We also measured telomere lengths by terminal restriction
fragment (TRF) Southern blotting after digestion of the genomic
DNA with the Hinf I and Rsa I restriction enzymes and
hybridization with telomere probes. The mean zebrafish telomere
length was determined to be 15–20 kb in embryos and larval fish as
well as in young adult fish (Figure S5C). Consistent with our earlier
Q-FISH results, the TRF lengths were found to be unchanged in the
zTERT-MO embryos (Figure S5C). To verify that telomere
length changes were indeed detectable by TRF Southern blotting,
we performed in vitro TRF shortening by DNase I nuclease treatment
of zebrafish genomic DNA (Figure S5C, a), as compared with
longer (high) and shorter (low) human telomeres (Figure S5C, b).
We likewise checked the integrity of the 39 G-strand overhangs, but
did not find significant differences between the zTERT knockdown
embryos and the controls (data not shown). It thus appears that the
inhibition of telomerase in the zTERT morphants is not sufficient to
elicit detectable telomere shortening during the early developmental
stages of zebrafish embryos.
With regard to the morphological phenotypes associated with a
zTERT knockdown, zTERT-MO-injected embryos appear nor-
mal throughout embryogenesis, although a slight growth retarda-
tion was observed until 24 hpf (data not shown). However, after
24 hpf, TERT morphants do not display marked gross morpho-
logical changes, and their growth and development proceeds at the
almost the same rate as in the control animals. We compared the
number of apoptotic cells in zTERT-MO-injected embryos with
wild-type animals. Accordingly, in zTERT morphants, TUNEL
(terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end-
labeling)-positive apoptotic cells can be observed throughout the
head and trunk and in the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta (VW-
DA) where the first definitive hematopoietic stem cells presumably
emerge at 28 hpf (Figure 2A, a, b), with a gradual reduction
after this time period. However, at 48 hpf (up to 72 hpf) in the
caudal venous plexus (CVP), TUNEL-positive cells are detectable
again (Figure 2A, c, d). The detection of TUNEL-positive cells in
zebrafish gata-1-promoter-driven GFP (gata-1GFP
) transgenic fish at
48 hpf revealed that apoptotic cells were indeed involved in the
blood cell population (Figure 2A, e). These results thus suggest
that a zTERT deficiency causes impaired hematopoiesis.
Induction of severe cytopenia and the impaired
differentiation of hematopoietic cells by zTERT
knockdown in zebrafish embryos
In contrast to the relatively normal morphological development
of the zTERT morphants, striking effects were observed in the
hematopoietic pathways in these embryos. Primitive blood cell
circulation becomes visible by 28 hpf in both zTERT morphants
and control embryos, whereas light microscopy reveals hypochro-
mic blood in zTERT morphants at 32 hpf (see the heme intensity
in Figure 2D). During 36–72 hpf, zTERT morphants became
increasingly anemic with erythrocytes becoming undetectable by
72 hpf (Figure 2B–D). From 60 hpf, circulating blood cells are
dramatically decreased in the heart and blood vessels of zTERT-
MO1-injected embryos (Figure 2B, g, k, o). At 72 hpf, Cont-
MO1-injected embryos contain an average of 125 cells per
0.5 mm of dorsal aorta, whereas most zTERT-MO1-injected
embryos show less than 5% of these numbers in the same area
(Figure 2C). The decrease of circulating blood cells in TERT-
deficient animals continued up to 5 days post fertilization (dpf), but
subsequently recovered by 7 dpf, due to the transient knockdown
of zTERT using MO in this system (data not shown). zTERT-
MO2 elicited this same spectrum of blood cell phenotypes (Figure
S6A–E).
We next examined whether the overexpression of zTERT could
rescue the blood cell number and differentiation phenotypes in our
system, hence relieving the embryonic cytopenia and anemia
induced by zTERT-MO1 and -MO2. Microinjection of a GFP-
tagged wild-type zTERT (GFP-zTERT) expression vector did not
cause any morphological abnormalities (data not shown). Co-
injections of zTERT-MO1 or -MO2 together with either the
GFP-zTERT or control GFP vector were then performed.
Figure 2B shows the blood circulation in the heart area (lateral
view, arrowhead indicates the heart). A red color that is indicative
of normal chromic blood cell circulation in the heart was not
observed at 48 and 72 hpf in TERT-deficient embryos
(Figure 2B, c, g). TERT-deficient animals were significantly
rescued from this decrease of blood cell circulation following the
co-expression of a zTERT vector, but not by a control GFP
vector, at 72 hpf (Figure 2B, g, h, o, p). Notably, the
overexpression of zTERT in Cont-MO-injected embryos did not
induce any significant changes such as over-proliferation of blood
cells (Figure 2B, C, b). These results provide strong evidence that

both anemia and cytopenia induced by two different zTERT-
MOs (MO1 and MO2) is caused by the specific inhibition of
zTERT function (see Figure S9 for MO2).
We speculated that blood progenitor cells in TERT-deficient
animals may not differentiate appropriately into normal mature
erythrocytes. We therefore analyzed, using whole-embryo staining

hematopoietic cells. (A) Induction of apoptosis in hematopoietic cells of the zebrafish embryo. Both a low magnification of the whole body and

with o-dianisidine, whether the red blood cells present in TERT-
deficient animals were sufficiently differentiated to become
hemoglobinized. We confirmed that there was a severe reduction
in the erythroid hemoglobin content in TERT-knockdown
embryos compared with control embryos from 32 to 96 hpf but
that these levels subsequently recovered by 7 dpf, due to the
transient nature of this knockdown system (Figure 2D for MO1,
Figure S6C, D for MO2). Moreover, the intravenous microin-
jection of iron-dextran failed to rescue this impaired hemoglobin
production (data not shown), indicating that inadequate levels of
circulatory iron cannot account for the hypochromia of TERT-
deficient embryos. These results suggest that the circulating
erythrocytes in TERT-deficient embryos are likely to still be
immature and have defects in hemoglobin synthesis and/or
production. This hypothesis was confirmed when we analyzed the
blood cells in the artery and veins by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
staining of tissue sections at 33 and 48 hpf. The blood cells in
zTERT morphants appeared blast-like, with large nuclei charac-
teristic of immature erythrocytes (Figure 2E). Wright-Giemsa
staining of isolated blood cells at 48 hpf also revealed inefficient
development of erythrocytes having a blastic (immature) pheno-
type (Figure 2E for MO1, Figure S6E for MO2). Taken
together, these results indicate that TERT function is likely to be
required for progenitor blood cell differentiation, and could also be
required for their specification, maturation, and survival. At
72 hpf, although peripheral blood cytopenia was obviously
detectable, some non-circulating blood cells still existed around
the CVP, as evident from a transverse section of a zTERT
morphant (data not shown). This suggests that phagocytosis
followed by apoptotic cell death due to ineffective hematopoiesis is
still actively occurring in these areas.
The involvement of zebrafish TERT in both primitive and
definitive hematopoiesis
To examine the requirement of the TERT gene during
developmental hematopoiesis in zebrafish, the expression of
multiple marker genes for both primitive and definitive hemato-
poiesis was analyzed by in situ hybridization. To evaluate the
requirement for TERT for primitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish,
we analyzed early hematopoietic markers in the anterior lateral
mesoderm (ALM) which produces myeloid cells, and the posterior
lateral mesoderm (PLM) that produces erythroid cells [53]. At
19 hpf (20-somite stage), the expression of stem cell leukemia (scl),
which is known to form a multimeric complex with lmo2 and gata-
2, indicates the initiation of hematopoietic stem cell formation
[61]. These early hematopoietic markers (scl; n = 80 of 85; 94%,
lmo2; n = 81 of 88; 92%, gata-2; n = 54 of 54; 100%) were reduced
in the ALM and PLM of the zTERT morphants (Figure 3A, a–f,
a’–d’) at 19 hpf, but almost recovered at the normal levels by
24 hpf (data not shown). Thus, both the ALM and PLM regions
are significantly but temporally affected by a zTERT knockdown
suggesting that hematopoietic cell specification is disturbed at least
in part.
Both c-myb and runx1 are expressed in definitive hematopoietic
stem and progenitor cells in the ventral wall of the zebrafish dorsal
aorta [62,63]. Both of these markers are diminished, however, in
TERT-deficient embryos from 32 hpf (c-myb; n = 56 of 57; 98%,
runx1; n = 68 of 69; 99%)–36 hpf (c-myb; n = 67 of 70; 96%, runx1;
n = 75 of 79; 95%) (Figure 3B, a–d, a’–d’, data not shown for
36 hpf). On the other hand, the expression of flk1, a marker of
vasculature endothelial cells, appears to be relatively normal in
comparison with control embryos during 24 hpf (n = 51 of 55;
93%) to 28 hpf (n = 45 of 50; 90%) (Figure 3B, q, r, q’, r’, data
not shown for 24 hpf). These results indicate that definitive
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells may be disrupted by a
zTERT deficiency, whereas vasculature endothelial cells appeared
to be unaffected, during early zebrafish development. We further
demonstrated that the vasculature system is intact in zTERT
morphants using a vasculature-specific ETS-domain transcription
factor fli-1 promoter-driven GFP-transgenic (fliGFP
) zebrafish
combined with microangiography (Figure S8).
Primitive erythrocytes expressing the gata-1 and globin bE3 genes
appear to be normal in the intermediate cell mass (ICM) of 28 hpf
(gata-1; n = 52 of 55; 95%, globin bE3; n = 64 of 68; 94%) to 30 hpf
(gata-1; n = 54 of 60; 90%, globin bE3; n = 54 of 59; 92%) TERT-
deficient zebrafish embryos when compared with control embryos
(Figure 3B, g–j). In contrast, the expression of delta-aminolevu-
linate synthase (alas2), which is the enzyme required for the first
step in heme biosynthesis, was found to be decreased from 26 hpf
(n = 41 of 41; 100%) to 32 hpf (n = 50 of 54; 93%) (Figure 3B, e,
f, e’, f’, data not shown for 26 hpf). This is consistent with the
hypochromic anemia phenotype showing reduced o-dianisidine
staining of the erythroid hemoglobin in TERT-deficient embryos
(Figure 2D). Moreover, the expression of pu.1, l-plastin and
myeloperoxidase (mpo), which is confined to the primitive myeloid
cells, is decreased in each case in the ICM of zTERT morphants at
28 hpf (pu.1; n = 42 of 45; 93%, l-plastin; n = 39 of 40; 98%, mpo;
n = 50 of 55; 91%) (Figure 3B, k–p, k’–p’). Taken together,
these results suggest that TERT is involved in both definitive and
primitive hematopoietic waves, which may therefore be respon-
sible for the subsequent pancytopenia in TERT deficient zebrafish
embryos. In addition, the expression patterns of these multiple
hematopoietic markers in TERT-deficient embryos injected with
zTERT-MO2 were similar to the zTERT-MO1-injected embryos
(Figure S7A, B).
We further analyzed whether circulating blood cells cause
apoptosis in zTERT-MO-injected embryos. By AO treatment of
living TERT-deficient zebrafish embryos, we could not detect
flowing AO-positive blood cells at 36, 48, and 72 hpf (data not
shown). However, as we described above, in fixed TERT-deficient
embryos, TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells were observed at the
ICM at 28 hpf (Figure 2A, a, b) and at the CVP at 48 hpf
(Figure 2A, c, d). Moreover, the detection of TUNEL-positive
cells in zebrafish gata-1GFP
transgenic fish at 72 hpf revealed that
apoptotic cells were indeed present in the blood cell populations
(Figure 2A, e). The CVP area, in addition to the posterior ICM
and aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM), has been reported to be
the region where both hematopoietic progenitors and phagocytic
cells exist [64]. Therefore, these stationary cells may include both
immature blood cells excluded from circulation and also dying
progenitors. The decreased numbers of GFP-positive cells
detectable in zTERT-deficient CD41-promoter-driven GFP
(CD41GFP
)-transgenic fish support this notion because CD41 is
presumably expressed on early hematopoietic stem cells and
progenitors during embryonic development (Figure S7C)
[65,66,67,68]. These data thus suggest that the defective
hematopoiesis resulting from TERT deficiency is associated with
the ineffective differentiation as well as the insufficient specification
of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.
Telomere lengths are maintained in the circulating blood
cells of TERT-deficient zebrafish embryos
We speculated that the loss of circulating blood cells in our
zebrafish morphants may be caused by specific and critical
telomere shortening, with associated telomere attrition and cellular
crisis, resulting from the induced zTERT deficiency. To test this
possibility, the telomere lengths were analyzed at the single cell
level using Q-FISH. At 36–48 hpf, sections of vessels including the
TERT in Hematopoiesis

circulating blood cells were hybridized with a telomere probe
(Figure 4A, a–d). Other tissues were also compared in terms of
telomere fluorescence intensities in control and zTERT mor-
phants (data not shown). The telomere lengths in the blood cells of
TERT-deficient embryos were found to be similar to those of the
control embryos. Moreover, in all of the examined tissues such as
the eye, brain and muscle (data not shown), as well as in blood
cells, no significant differences in the telomere lengths could be
observed between zTERT morphants and control animals
(Figure 4A, e).
In order to analyze telomere lengths more specifically in the
erythroid cell lineage, we also utilized gata-1GFP
-transgenic fish
[69]. Since endogenous gata-1 expression was found to be
unchanged in our zTERT morphants (Figure 3B, g, h), it was

-
transgenic fish. The gata-1GFP
-positive fluorescent cells were
localized in the ICM at 28 hpf and no critical differences in cell
numbers were observed between the control and zTERT
morphants (data not shown) [66]. These fluorescent cells were
isolated from living embryos by cell sorting (FACS) at 48 hpf when
blood cells in TERT-deficient embryos are still present
(Figure 4B, a). Circulating blood cells, in control gata-1GFP
-
transgenic fish are visible by GFP at 4 dpf, at a time when no
circulating gata-1GFP
-positive cells can be observed in blood vessels
of the zTERT morphants (data not shown). However, some
uncirculated GFP-positive cells still existed around the CVP in the
zTERT knockdown embryos (data not shown). Impairments of the
vasculature, such as vascular leaks and malformations, were also
not observed by microangiography in the zTERT morphants at
any time during the period of observation (32–96 hpf) (Figure S8
for 72 hpf). To demonstrate the effects of a zTERT knockdown in
gata-1GFP
-positive cells, the sorted cells were subjected to a TRAP
assay (Figure 4B, b, c). The cells sorted from TERT-deficient
embryos show immature erythrocyte morphology (insets of
Figure 4B, a), and have reduced telomerase activity in
comparison with untreated and control embryos (Figure 4B, b,
c). Nevertheless, we still did not detect any zTERT deficiency-
induced telomere shortening by telomere length Q-FISH analysis
in smears of gata-1GFP
-positive erythroid cells (Figure 4C). These
results suggest that TERT is involved in blood cell differentiation
during early development irrespective of the telomere length and
maintenance status of these cells.
A p53-deficiency prevents a zTERT deficiency-induced
blood cell decrease in the zebrafish embryo
It has been suggested that p53 is involved in the regulation of
apoptosis in hematopoietic progenitors [70,71]. However, in
hematopoietic cells, the evidence of a link between p53-dependent
apoptosis and telomerase function has not been well established.
To elucidate a possible role of p53 in the changes to the blood cell
number and differentiation brought about by TERT deficiency in
the zebrafish embryo, we injected zTERT-MOs into p53-mutant
(p53m/m
) embryos [72], and into p53 morphants, and compared
these with control wild-type embryos. The p53m/m
zebrafish are
homozygous for the loss-of-function mutation of M214K:
methionine-214 in exon 7 is substituted by lysine. [72]. In both
p53+/+
and p53m/m
embryos with a knockdown of zTERT, blood
circulation commences at around 24–28 hpf, and the number of
blood cells decreases by about 50% at 36–48 hpf (data not shown).
By 72 hpf, however, p53m/m
zTERT morphants showed a
significant number of blood cells throughout the circulatory
system including the heart and caudal vessels, while virtually
almost no circulating blood cells are detectable in the p53+/+
background (Figure 5A–C). As shown in Figure 5D, the
apoptotic response of the cells at the CVP in zTERT-deficient
embryos is dependent upon the p53 status. At 48 hpf, TUNEL-
positive apoptotic cells can be detected in the CVP in zTERT-
deficient embryos under normal p53 conditions in the wild-type
background as expected. In contrast, TUNEL-positive cells at this
region are significantly reduced in number in zTERT- and p53-
double deficient embryos obtained via MO injections against the
corresponding genes. These same results were also obtained using
p53m/m
animals (data not shown).
We next examined the presence of hemoglobin (by o-dianisidine
staining) in zTERT- and p53-double deficient animals
(Figure 5E), as well as in zTERT-deficient p53m/m
fish (data
not shown), compared with control animals at 48 hpf. Although
the loss of circulating blood cells induced by TERT deficiency was
found to be significantly alleviated in both p53 morphants and
mutants, o-dianisidine staining revealed still hypochromic blood in
these cases, suggesting that the differentiation of erythroblasts
remains insufficient or impaired (Figure 5E, a–d). Ineffective
erythroid cell development showing a blastic phenotype in
zTERT-deficient p53m/m
embryos was also evident from Wright-
Giemsa staining of isolated blood cells at 48 hpf (Figure 5E, a’–
d’). The reduction in c-myb (n = 52 of 55; 95%) and runx1 (n = 56 of
58; 97%) expression in zTERT morphants was also unchanged in
the p53-deficient genetic background, suggesting that the definitive
hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cell development is not
fundamentally restored in the p53 mutants (Figure 5F), and p53
morphants (data not shown). Thus, these results indicate that the
loss of p53 function can significantly suppress the reduction in
blood cell numbers due to zTERT deficiency, but cannot restore
the impairment of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and their
differentiation into mature erythrocytes.
We next monitored the expression of representative genes that
are downstream of the p53 pathway in zTERT-deficient animals
via single-embryo reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). The
upregulation of p53 mRNA was evident in the TERT-deficient
embryos compared with the controls (Figure 5G). In the case of
downstream targets of p53, mdm2, p21(/waf1/CIP1), but not bax,
were proportionally upregulated in the zTERT-deficient embryos
and this response was suppressed by p53 MO knockdown
(Figure 5G). This indicated that p53-dependent cell cycle arrest
pathways are correspondingly activated in TERT deficient
embryos. These single-embryo RT-PCR results are representative
of similar analyses that we performed on additional samples (wild-
type, n = 12; TERTMO
-p53MO
, n = 10; TERTMO
-p53cont
, n = 10;
TERTcont
-p53MO
, n = 10; TERTcont
-p53cont
, n = 12; data not
shown). Furthermore, in our zTERT morphants, hspa9b/
mortalin-2, the deficiency of which has been reported to similarly
cause multilineage cytopenia in zebrafish [56], was also found to
be slightly upregulated in the absence of significant suppression by
p53 knockdown (Figure 5G), implicating that an adaptive
response exists to sustain blood cell production.
It has been reported that Bcl-2 expression can inhibit the
apoptotic response mediated by the p53 pathway in zebrafish as
well as in mammals [73,74,75]. To test this in our current study,

by the presence of immature erythrocytes (erythroblasts) and
anemia (data not shown for Bcl-2 and E1B-19K). This suggests
that apoptosis is not the primary causative mechanism governing
the hematopoietic cell abnormalities caused by the TERT
deficiency.
The restoration of both reduced blood cell number and
impaired differentiation in hematopoiesis by the forced
expression of both zebrafish and human TERT
As we have already demonstrated, a zTERT knockdown induces
both a dramatic reduction in the number of circulating blood cells
and an inefficient developmental hematopoiesis, concurrent with
the inhibition of telomerase activity in zebrafish in vivo, but in the
absence of detectable telomere length alterations. These findings
prompted us to investigate whether any activities of TERT that are
unrelated to telomerase and telomere functions may be critical for
blood cell differentiation and maintenance.
As described above, the TERT protein has a conserved
structural organization that is divided into four functional
domains; the N-terminal extension domain, the TR-binding
domain, the catalytic RT domain, and the C-terminal extension
domain (Figure 6A) [6]. Each of these domains is required for full
activity [6], but the TR-binding and enzymatic RT domains of
TERT are particularly critical for telomere maintenance [13]. To
investigate the functional significance of these two domains of
TERT during hematopoiesis in zebrafish, we generated a series of
mutant zTERT constructs (Figure 6A) based upon previous
studies of hTERT [12,76,77], and examined whether these
mutant proteins could still rescue blood cell number and
differentiation when overexpressed in zTERT-deficient embryos.
The positive expression of each construct was confirmed by GFP-
tagging and the resulting fluorescence in live animals (Figure 6B),
and also by western blotting for GFP-tagged zTERT using anti-
GFP antibodies and for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged hTERT using
anti-HA antibodies (data not shown). The injection of either wild-

activity was detected by quantitative fluorometric TRAP assay. Each relative telomerase activity value was quantified as a percentage of the activity
observed in Cont-MO1-injected embryos expressing a GFP empty vector (GFP) from three independent experiments. *

type zTERT (WT-zTERT) or hTERT (WT-hTERT) cDNA
rescues the blood cell number and differentiation, and reverses
both the cytopenia and anemia that accompany maturation
failure, in hematopoiesis of zTERT-deficient embryos (Figure 7A,
B, Figure S9, Figure S10).
The specific mutations generating substitutions of the aspartic
acid and valine residues at positions 710 and 711 with alanine and
isoleucine (D710A and V711I) in the RT motif A of hTERT result
in the ablation of authentic telomerase activity and confer
dominant-negative properties against the authentic telomerase
activity and canonical function of TERT (DN-hTERT) [76,78].
This metal-binding portion of TERT is highly conserved between
zebrafish and humans (Figure S1). Therefore, we generated the

generates primitive erythrocytes from progenitor cells in the intermediate cell mass (ICM) (represented by the blue color in the 20 and 28 hpf embryo
models). The second definitive/adult wave gives rise to hematopoietic stem cells which have the potential to differentiate into all hematopoietic
lineages and possess the self-renewal ability to maintain their blood system throughout life. Definitive hematopoietic cells, including stem cells, first
arise in the aorta gonad mesonephros (AGM) region (represented by the red color in the 48 hpf embryo model). Definitive hematopoietic stem cells
are thought to subsequently colonize the kidney, thymus, and pancreas [53,88]. Our current model suggests that zTERT deficiency affects both
primitive and definitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish, and induces impaired differentiation of the blood cells, including the erythrocyte lineage, prior to
maturation. An ‘X’ next to the indicated gene denotes downregulated expression. The yellow ‘X’ in this schematic indicates a somewhat impaired
pathway and the red ‘X’ designates a severely impaired pathway. (E) A TERT deficiency in the zebrafish embryo leads to abnormal differentiation and
apoptosis, presumably of hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells. This subsequently leads to the circulation of immature blood cells with
hypochromic anemia due to a disruption of both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis without telomere shortening. Non-canonical functions of
TERT, i.e. authentic telomerase-independent roles, may thus regulate the differentiation of hematopoietic cells, as well as protect these cells from
apoptotic cell death during hematopoiesis.

the same RT motif A of zTERT, to generate a catalytic function-
defective zTERT mutant (CD-zTERT) (Figure 6A). As expected,
the expression of CD-zTERT in the zTERT morphants did not
restore telomerase activity, confirming that this mutant is
catalytically inactive, and also functioned in a dominant-negative
manner against authentic telomerase activity (Figure 6C, a, b).
In contrast, the expression of WT-zTERT in the zTERT-
knockdown embryos substantially increased telomerase activity
by about two-fold, compared with the control (Figure 6C, b).
Neither exogenous CD-zTERT nor DN-hTERT caused an
obvious rescue of the subsequent cytopenic phenotype for blood
cell numbers, but the manifestation evidenced by the heme
intensity was slightly restored by both constructs (Figure 7A, B,
Figure S9, Figure S10).
To eliminate the TR-binding ability of zTERT, we created a
mutant harboring a deletion of the entire 587 N-terminal amino
acids (DTR-zTERT), based on the previously identified TR region
of hTERT [6,12] (Figure 6A). The DTR-zTERT protein did not
show any significant telomerase activity (Figure 6C, b). However,
and more importantly, by expressing this mutant, the cytopenia
and anemia phenotypes in the TERT-deficient zebrafish embryos
were successfully rescued by restoration of the impaired differen-
tiation of erythrocytes (Figure 7A, B, Figure S9, Figure S10).
A DTR-CD-zTERT double mutant, which harbors the TR-
binding domain deletion and also contains the D682A/V683I
mutations, had no detectable telomerase activity as expected
(Figure 6C, Figure S11). The embryos injected with this
construct were not significantly protected from endpoint cytope-
nia, but still slightly recovered from the manifestation of a
decreased heme intensity presumably through partial heme
synthesis/production in insufficiently differentiated cells
(Figure 7A, B, Figure S9, Figure S10). These findings from
both zTERT and hTERT rescue studies indicate that irrespective
of its TR-binding ability and authentic telomerase activity, there
are non-canonical functions of the RT domain of TERT which
may be particularly essential for hematopoietic cell differentiation
and survival. In addition, since DTR-zTERT no longer specifically
localizes in the nucleus (Figure 6B, d, d’), but still rescues the
hematopoietic phenotype, the activities of DTR-zTERT in the
cytoplasm may be capable of attenuating any blood cell
abnormalities.
Finally, consistent with the results of our rescue experiments
described above, cytomorphological abnormalities, such as large
nuclei and the basophilic cytoplasms of immature erythrocytes,
were found also to be restored by both DTR-zTERT and WT-
zTERT expression in the morphant embryos (Figure 7C).
Intriguingly, a moderate level of restoration of these aberrant
morphologies in erythrocytes by CD-zTERT and DTR-CD-
zTERT was also observed (Figure 7C). Taken together, these
data suggest that a metal-binding-dependent certain novel
‘catalytic’ function of zTERT is critical for the full maintenance
of hematopoiesis, but also that other ‘non-catalytic’ function(s) of
TERT could be involved in hematopoietic cell differentiation at
least in part because mutant TERT (CD-zTERT, DTR-CD-
zTERT, or DN-hTERT) having a disruption to its metal-binding
function still retains a minor ability for this process in heme
intensity and cellular morphology. Thus, the canonical TERT
function as the authentic/conventional telomerase activity is
presumably not essential for hematopoietic cell development
observed in our current system. The results of our current study
further indicate that an unknown and non-canonical (enzymatic)
function(s) associated with the RT motifs of TERT are likely to be
required for normal hematopoietic cell development during
vertebrate embryogenesis (Table S1).
Discussion
A deficiency in TERT in zebrafish causes ineffective hemato-
poiesis accompanied by anemia, impaired specification and
differentiation, hematopoietic cell apoptosis, and pancytopenia.
Moreover, these phenotypes observed in TERT-knockdown
zebrafish embryos resemble MDS in humans. Disabled differen-
tiation in hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells may underlie
both the apoptotic response and maturation defects which occur in
both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis, although further
studies will be required to definitively elucidate this relationship.
The disruption of the hematopoietic cell lineages caused by the
zTERT deficiency in our current study was observed in the
absence of telomere length alterations, although both the apoptotic
and cytopenic phenotypes in these mutants were still dependent, at
least in part, upon p53 and Bcl-2 functions. Intriguingly, the
overexpression of the RT domain of zTERT (without the TR-
binding domain) as well as full-length zTERT rescues the TERT-
deficient animals from pancytopenia, with a concurrent restora-
tion of differentiation. Taken together, our data suggest that
zTERT is involved in both the differentiation and survival of
hematopoietic cells independently of its canonical role in telomere
maintenance.
A crucial role of TERT in hematopoietic cell differentiation
and survival in vertebrates
It has been reported previously that the zebrafish Hspa9b/
Mortalin-2 mutant shows a developmental blood defect that
closely recapitulates the ineffective hematopoiesis seen in MDS
patients [56]. In our present study, we demonstrate that zTERT-
deficient embryos show a reduction in their red blood cell numbers
and harbor myeloid cells with abnormal differentiation, indicating
the occurrence of pancytopenia. These abnormalities have also
been reported in mutant Hspa9b/Mortalin-2 embryos. In our
current TERT morphants, in addition to reductions in the levels of
scl+
and lmo2+
primitive hematopoietic progenitors, c-myb+
and
runx1+
definitive hematopoietic stem cells as well as CD41+
hematopoietic precursor cells were also found to be significantly
decreased (Figure 3, Figure S7), suggesting that hematopoietic
stem cell populations are also impaired by the loss of TERT. Since
MDS is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disease characterized by
ineffective hematopoiesis and peripheral cytopenias, TERT
deficiency in zebrafish possibly recapitulates this disorder. During
zebrafish hematopoiesis, definitive progenitors can be observed in
the posterior ICM and in the dorsal aorta as early as 24 hpf
[79,80,81]. However, since it is unknown whether zebrafish
hematopoietic stem cells continue to arise de novo, we cannot rule
out the possibility that a failure of later arising stem cell
populations to develop may lead to the actual blood cell reduction
which we observe by 72 hpf.
Although there is accumulating evidence that apoptosis plays a
crucial role in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell develop-
ment, the precise mechanisms and roles of TERT in apoptotic
signaling pathways have not so far been elucidated. Recent reports
strongly suggest that p53, Puma, Slug, and Bcl-2 family members,
including Mcl-1, play crucial roles in the agonistic versus
antagonistic regulation of apoptosis in hematopoietic stem and/
or progenitor cells [70]. In our current zTERT morphants,
decreases in the circulating blood cells were restored by either a
p53 knockdown by MOs or a p53 mutant background. The
overexpression of Bcl-2 or E1B-19K was also found to counteract
the reduction in the number of blood cells due to cytopenia.
Interestingly, caspase-3 activation was only detectable during
primitive hematopoiesis in these TERT morphants from 19–

24 hpf, and not at later stages (data not shown). Furthermore,
inhibition of this early caspase activation decreases the levels of
TERT knockdown-induced apoptosis in the ICM primitive wave
(,28 hpf), whereas a later apoptotic response observed in the
CVP (48–72 hpf) is unaffected by this caspase suppression (data
not shown). Notably also, caspase inhibition does not appear to be
effective in inhibiting the cytopenic phenotype of the zTERT
morphants. Thus, the later apoptosis mediated by p53 in the CVP
of the zTERT knockdown embryos may be independent of early
caspase activation, but is presumably linked with the induction of
cytopenia that is evident by 72 hpf. Further analyses will be
required to determine the underlying mechanisms connecting the
early and late phases of apoptosis during the transition stages from
primitive to definitive hematopoiesis.
Importantly, none of the interventions (p53 deficiency, Bcl-2,
and E1B-19K) used in our present experiments that inhibit
apoptosis were capable of restoring the insufficient differentiation
and maturation of erythrocytes in the zTERT morphants
(Figure 5E, and data not shown), suggesting that TERT is an
essential component of certain processes underlying hematopoietic
cell differentiation, regardless of the survival pathways that may be
initiated.
Differing functions of TERT in hematopoiesis among
vertebrate species
The well documented and conventional function of TERT is its
role as the catalytic component of telomerase which is indispens-
able for the maintenance of telomeres, and thus genome integrity
[7]. However, there are several fundamental differences in both
the telomere and telomerase biology of different vertebrates. In
lower vertebrates in particular, such as zebrafish, telomerase is
constitutively active in multiple organs and may support
continuous growth of the animal throughout its lifespan
[20,21,22,23]. In contrast, higher vertebrates have more tightly
regulated telomerase activity and most normal somatic cells
usually do not have active telomerase, except for stem/progenitor
cells. Cells that become cancerous also have active telomerase in
most cases.
Moreover, in terms of telomere length, mouse telomeres (40–
60 kb) (particularly in inbred mice) are much longer than human
telomeres (10–15 kb), although long telomeres do not appear to be
necessary for survival in the mouse [20,29,82,83,84]. Zebrafish
telomere lengths (15–20 kb) are relatively similar to those in
humans, based upon the results of our current study. We would
contend therefore that the roles of telomeres and telomerase
during hematopoiesis cannot be inferred simply from a single
animal model but needs to be studied comparatively in several
vertebrate species, as well as directly in human cells. This also
means that the role of not only telomerase, but also TERT in
hematopoietic cells is still incompletely understood. In TR-
knockout mice, as well as in TERT-knockout mice, it has been
suggested that telomeres show moderate shortening over several
generations [43], and subsequently suffer from impaired cell
proliferative capability in highly proliferative tissues [17]. On the
other hand, even a partial telomerase deficiency in humans
brought about by mutations in either TR or TERT has been
associated with early or late onset bone marrow failure, as seen in
patients with dyskeratosis congenita and aplastic anemia
[48,49,85]. Bone marrow failure or spontaneous and sporadic
anemia has been reported in TR-knockout mice [50], but not in
TERT-knockout mice, although further characterizations of
TERT are required in the mouse. In our present zebrafish
studies, however, a pancytopenia phenotype was observed in
TERT-knockdown embryos following MO injections, which was
rescued by following injection of a zTERT mutant (DTR-zTERT)
lacking the TR domain, suggesting that the cytopenia is not due to
direct inhibition of authentic telomerase activity itself. Given our
findings of lengthening-independent and TR-binding domain-
unrelated TERT function(s), hematopoiesis in zebrafish might be
more susceptible to the disruption of a non-canonical function of
TERT in comparison with the mouse.
Novel non-canonical functions of zebrafish TERT in
hematopoiesis
In previous studies, hematopoietic stem cells from TERT-
deficient as well as TR-deficient mice showed reduced repopulat-
ing abilities by serial transplantation assay [86], demonstrating
that both TERT and TR are critical for normal stem cell function
via sustained telomere length maintenance. It has also been
reported that TERT overexpression enhances the self-renewal
ability of embryonic stem cells, promotes their resistance to
apoptosis, and increases their proliferation and ultimate differen-
tiation into hematopoietic lineages [87]. However it is presently
unclear to what extent telomere length maintenance via TERT is
essential for stem cell activation. Recent studies of TERT
overexpression in mice clearly show that telomere length-
independent novel function(s) are responsible for hair follicle stem
cell mobilization and proliferation, regardless of telomere synthesis
[27,29]. However, one previous report has rather surprisingly
showed that TR was still required for this function of TERT [27],
whereas another has demonstrated that a TR-unrelated function is
essential for this alternative role of TERT [29]. Most recently,
Choi et al. further reported that a catalytically inactive mutant of
TERT (TERTci
) retains the full activity of wild-type TERT in hair
follicle stem cell activation and keratinocyte proliferation [40].
Our current finding that the DTR-zTERT rescues the effects of
zTERT depletion is consistent with a TR-independent functional
role (Table S1). The evidence that CD-zTERT significantly loses
its function in hematopoiesis further suggests that TR-independent
unknown (catalytic) activities of TERT may be involved in
hematopoietic cell differentiation and survival. Therefore, there
are at least three types of telomere metabolism-independent non-
canonical functions of TERT; the first of these still requires both
TERT and TR [27], the second does not requires the catalytic
activity of TERT (i.e., TERTci
) and TR [29,40], and the third that
we have elucidated herein does not require the authentic
(conventional) catalytic activity of TERT but requires TR-
independent (catalytic) activities/functions of TERT.
When and how does TERT function non-canonically? It is
possible that if the telomeres are longer than a certain minimal
length, TERT may perform non-canonical functions at intracel-
lular locations other than telomeres. Under these circumstances,
TERT may be able to alternatively function in cellular
proliferation and mobilization, or may be required for cellular
differentiation and survival independent of telomere metabolisms.
Our present findings support this notion. Hence, zTERT-deficient
embryos exhibit severe anemia and cytopenia that presumably
results from disruption of the primitive and definitive waves of
hematopoiesis in the absence of alterations in telomere length.
Furthermore, a zTERT deficiency likely causes defects in
hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells. TERT might affect
the self-renewal of stem cells as well as normal specification and
differentiation of stem/progenitor cells during zebrafish hemato-
poiesis when these cells have telomeres of sufficient length and
integrity. Although an extremely minor number of critically short
telomeres may still affect the maintenance of hematopoietic
lineages, it should be noted that we did not detect any significant
differences in the lengths in critically short telomeres or the
TERT in Hematopoiesis

average telomere lengths in zTERT-deficient embryos. No pattern
of short telomeres at the same chromosome ends was evident
either in the zTERT morphants i.e. specific chromosome ends
with short telomeres were essentially randomly distributed in both
the control and zTERT-MO1- or MO2-injected embryos (Figure
S5).
On the other hand, our current results do not exclude the
possibility that the telomere lengths themselves are also critical for
the maintenance of hematopoietic cell lineages. In fact, it has been
reported that wild-type mice derived from the late generation of
mTR+/2
heterozygous parents which had short telomeres display
hematopoietic phenotypes resembling aplastic anemia and dys-
keratosis congenita [50]. However, our data strongly suggest that
non-canonical TERT functions exist that are separate from its role
in telomere maintenance via telomerase and regulate hematopoi-
etic cell differentiation and survival, presumably without affecting
telomere length.
In zebrafish embryos, as shown in Figure 7D, hematopoiesis
occurs in primitive and definitive waves. The first primitive/
embryonic wave mainly generates primitive erythrocytes from
progenitor cells in the ICM (represented by blue color in the 20
and 28 hpf embryo models). The second definitive/adult wave
gives rise to hematopoietic stem cells which have the potential to
differentiate into all hematopoietic lineages and possess the self-
renewal ability to maintain the blood system throughout life.
Definitive hematopoietic cells, including stem cells, first arise in the
AGM region (represented by red color in the 48 hpf embryo
model). Definitive hematopoietic stem cells are thought to
subsequently colonize the kidney, thymus, and pancreas [53,88].
Our current model suggests that zTERT deficiency affects both
primitive and definitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish, and induces
impaired differentiation of the blood cells, including the
erythrocyte lineage, prior to maturation. Moreover, TERT
deficiency leads to the abnormal differentiation and apoptosis
presumably of hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cells,
subsequently leading to the circulation of immature blood cells
with anemia, by disturbing normal hematopoiesis without obvious
telomere shortening. Non-canonical functions of TERT other
than telomerase may thus regulate the differentiation of hemato-
poietic cells, as well as protect them from apoptotic cell death
during developmental hematopoiesis (Figure 7E).
An important question that arises from our current data is the
nature of the mechanism that underlies this non-canonical
function of zTERT. In many other species, the RT domain of
TERT has not been demonstrated to contribute to TR binding,
although this has not been directly confirmed in zebrafish [31].
Because TERT mutants bearing deletions in their TR-binding
domain functionally rescue both the circulating blood cells and
defective differentiation of hematopoietic cells in zTERT mor-
phants, an unknown activity of the RT domain of TERT, other
than telomerase activity, may be crucial for hematopoiesis. Our
data thus encourage further studies to address three important
questions: (1) the nature of the mechanisms by which TERT can
regulate hematopoietic cell differentiation and survival without
telomere regulation; (2) the intracellular locations and regions
where these non-canonical functions operate within the cell; and
(3) the precise target of the non-canonical function(s) of the RT
domain of TERT.
In the phylogenetic tree of TERT and retroelements rooted
with RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, the RT motifs in the RT
family are universally conserved [including multicopy single-
stranded DNA, group II introns, LTR or non-LTR (Long
Terminal Repeat) retrotransposons, and viral RT] [10,89].
Structural and functional analyses of viral RT and TERT have
revealed striking degrees of conservation of important residues
within the RT motifs involved in nucleotide binding, rNTP/dNTP
discrimination, and nucleotide addition processivity between viral
RT and TERT [10]. Unlike all other RT family members, only
TERT carries an N-terminal extension as its RNA-binding
domain. Based on these facts, it is tempting to speculate that the
high-affinity RNA-binding domain of TERT defines (or confines)
telomere-interacting specificity, but the RT domain itself may
function in a conventional way in certain genomic DNA
structures. Alternatively, it has been recently demonstrated that
both yeast and human TERT can function as a template- and
RNA-independent terminal transferase (TT) for DNA synthesis in
the presence of Mn2+
[90]. Conceivably, this TT activity might
underlie one of the functional roles of the TR-binding domain-
deleted zTERT mutant. Although the intrinsic ability of TERT to
act as an intracellular TT in vertebrates still needs to be
demonstrated in vivo, a variety of DNA and RNA polymerases
including RTs are well known to mediate template-independent
nucleotide addition under certain conditions [90]. Irrespective of
the telomere ends, such a template- and RNA-independent TT
activity of TERT may be capable of functioning in the repair of
broken terminal ends.
It is also possible that RT motifs themselves might interact with
some regulatory non-protein-coding RNAs (regulatory RNAs),
such as microRNAs, which have been shown to be involved in
modulation of certain gene expressions at both the transcriptional
and post-transcriptional level. Such regulatory RNAs participate
in many mechanisms that regulate chromatin modification and
transcription factor activity, and influence mRNA stability,
processing, and translation, all of which are key factors in multiple
aspects of differentiation and development, including hematopoi-
esis [91,92,93]. Indeed, it has already been shown that TERT can
influence the expression of a number of other genes such as p53,
p21, pRb, cyclin D1, epidermal growth factor receptor, transforming growth
factor-b, and DNA methyltransferase [40,94,95,96,97,98,99,100], and
is presumably therefore involved in the regulation of several genes.
In our current analysis of zebrafish embryogenesis, we could also
observe a differential gene expression profile induced by zTERT
knockdown with regard to hematopoietic cell differentiation for
the scl, lmo2, gata-2, runx1, c-myb, alas2, pu.1, l-plastin, mpo, and CD41
genes (a downregulation of their expression) (Figure 7E), in
addition to the induction of p53, p21, and mdm2. These data
indicate that a zTERT deficiency may induce a defect in
hematopoiesis not through telomere dysfunction, but through a
potent and specific effect on the gene expression of several key
regulators during early development in zebrafish.
Clearly, further studies will be necessary to more precisely
determine the physiological non-canonical functions of TERT
during hematopoietic cell differentiation and survival. Our current
data demonstrate however that the zebrafish model may provide
powerful new information regarding the hematopoietic program
that is physiologically relevant to both vertebrate biology, and to
telomerase- and telomere-related clinical disorders of human
blood formation.

Microinjection of morpholino oligonucleotides and
cDNAs
Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MO) (Gene Tools, LLC)
were used for knockdown of both the zTERT and zp53 genes. The
stock solution was diluted to 250 or 500 mM. The sequence of
zTERT MO1 (zTERT-MO1) is 59-CTGTCGAGTACTGTCCA-
GACATCTG-39, which is at the 59-translation start site. The
complementary sequence of the putative zTERT ATG start site is
underlined. The sequence of the inverse zTERT control MO1 is 59-
GTCTACAGACCTGTCATGAGCTGTC-39 (data not shown),
and the sequence of the 5-mispair zTERT control MO1 (Cont-
MO1) is 59-CTCTCCAGTACTCTCCACACATGTG-39. The
splice-block morpholino antisense oligonucleotide of zTERT
(zTERT-MO2) was used to confirm that the phenotypic effects of
zTERT-MO1 were TERT-specific. The sequence of zTERT-MO2
is 59-CACTCACACATTGAAGAGCTTCACC-39, which is at the
39 end of exon 5 and its intron splice junction. The sequence of the
5-mispair control MO (Cont-MO2) is 59-CAGTCACAGATT-
CAACAGCTTGACC-39. Both the zp53 and 4-mispair zp53
control MOs have been described previously [105].
GFP-tagged wild-type zTERT and mutant zTERT constructs
were used in the rescue experiments. One point six to eight ng of
the TERT-MO or Cont-MO and 75–300 pg of the TERT or
EGFP (enhanced GFP) plasmids were injected into single-cell stage
embryos at the yolk and cytoplasm interface.
Plasmids
A 2,287 base-pair fragment of full-length zTERT cDNA
(GenBank accession number; submitted) was isolated by RT-PCR
(see supplemental Text S1), and cloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector
(Clontech). pCI-neo-hTERT-HA (WT-hTERT) and pCI-neo-DN-
hTERT-HA (DN-hTERT) were kindly provided by William Hahn
[76]. The mutated region of the DN-hTERT is conserved in
zebrafish TERT (Figure S1), and we therefore generated a DN
zTERT accordingly (catalytically inactive zTERT; CD-zTERT) by
substituting the aspartic acid and valine residues at positions 682 and
683 with alanine and isoleucine residues, respectively. This was
achieved by site-directed mutagenesis of the WT-zTERT vector
using the oligonucleotides, 59-GCTCTACTTCGTCAAGGTCGC-
GATCAGCGGAGCGTATGACAG–39 and 59-CTGTCATACG-
CTCCGCTGATCGCGACCTTGACGAAGTAGAGC–39. The
mutant construct was then confirmed by sequencing. Deletion
vectors were generated by PCR using WT-zTERT and CD-zTERT
as templates. zTERT 1732-3388 (EcoRI-SalI) was amplified by PCR
using the primers 59-ACGCGAATTCGAAGGGCCAGTG-
GAGGCCCCTGTCTCCATC-39 and 59-GAGAGTCGACGGG-
CAGTGCAGATGTGTTTAGTCAGC-39, and cloned into the
pEGFP-C1 vector.
Monitoring of zTERT knockdown in vivo using a 59
fragment of zTERT-EGFP
A 59 fragment containing the translational initiation site of
zTERT cDNA (-3-123) was amplified by PCR from a wild-type
zTERT expression vector (WT-zTERT vector). The amplified
DNA fragments were subsequently purified by excision from an
agarose gel. zTERT -3-123 (EcoRI-SalI) was amplified using the
primers 59-GAGAGAATTCCACAGATGTCTGGACAG-
TACTCGA-39 and 59-AGAGGTCGACTGTCGGCCGT-
CAGGGAATTGCAGT-39, and was then cloned into pEGFP-
N1 vector (pEGFP-59zTERT) (Figure S4, a). 1–2 nl of 100 ng/
ml pEGFP-59zTERT or empty vector (pEGFP-N1) was coinjected
with zTERT-MO1 or Cont-MO1 into the yolk sac of embryos at
the single-cell stage, and observed at 24 hpf using a Zeiss Axioskop
microscope. At least 25 embryos in each injection group were
captured and quantified by determining the pixel intensity of the
GFP signals using Photoshop software.
RT-PCR analysis of zTERT splicing block by zTERT-MO2
For RT-PCR detection of the zTERT splicing block by MO2,
forward and reverse primers to amplify a fragment between exon 4
and 8 of zTERT were used (59- AGTGACATCCCGCATC-
CGCTTTAT-39 and 59- AGGGCTTTCTCCATGTGTCCG-
TAAC-39, respectively). Control b-actin primers were also used (59-
CCCAGACATCAGGGAGTGAT-39, and 59-CACCGATCCA-
GACGGAGTAT-39, respectively) as previously described [73].
Assay for telomerase activity (TRAP assay)
For telomerase activity measurements in zebrafish embryo and cell
extracts, the TRAP (Telomere Repeat Amplification Protocol) assay
was performed using three different types of detection methods.
The TRAPezeH telomerase detection kit (Chemicon), was used
for the electrophoretic gel analysis according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The PCR products were separated on 10% polyacryl-
amide gels and visualized with SYBRH Green (Molecular Probes).
The TRAPezeH XL kit (Chemicon) was used for a PCR-based
quantitative fluorescence assay for telomerase activity detections.
The TRAPezeH XL kit uses AmplifluorH fluorescence energy
transfer labeled primers to obtain semi-quantitative measurements,
which enables homogeneous signal amplification and quantification
directly in the unopened PCR vessel. For measurement of samples,
we used mQuant Microplate Spectrophotometer (BioTek Instru-
ments) with the excitation/emission parameters for fluorescein
(495 nm/516 nm) and sulforhodamine (600 nm/620 nm)
The TeloTAGGG Telomerase PCR ELISAPLUS
(Roche
Applied Science) was used for a PCR-based quantitative ELISA
assay for telomerase activity detections according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Using mQuant Microplate Spectrophotometer
(BioTek Instruments), samples were measured by the absorbance
at 450 nm with a reference wave length of 690 nm within 30 min
after adding the stop reagent.
Whole-mount measurement of zebrafish telomere
lengths in interphase nuclei by fluorescence in situ
hybridization
Individual telomere lengths were analyzed by quantitative
fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH). Q-FISH was
performed using a Cy3-conjugated OO-(CCCTAA)3 PNA
oligonucleotide (Cy3-telomere PNA probe) (Applied Biosystems)
as described [106]. Metaphase spreads were washed in PBS for
15 min and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 2 min. After
dehydration, a Cy3-telomere PNA probe (10 nM) was added, and
the samples were incubated at 85uC for 5 min for denaturation,
and then in hybridization solution (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2),
70% formamide, and 1% BSA) overnight at room temperature in
the dark. After incubation, the embryos were washed three times
in 70% formamide, 10 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.2) for 15 min, and
twice again in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl, 0.05%
Tween 20), and then counterstained with 0.5 mg/ml 49,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Images were acquired by using
a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. Telomere profiles were analyzed
using the TFL-TELO software provided by Peter Lansdorp [107].

Oregon). Briefly, 8 hpf zebrafish embryos were treated with 1 mg/
ml colchicine (Sigma) at 28.5uC for 14–16 h and then harvested at
22–24 hpf. Embryos were washed with PBS containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), mashed and filtered through a 100 mm nylon
filter to be suspended cells. The cells were then resuspended in 1.1%
sodium citrate and 4 mg/ml colchicine for 25uC for 25 min, and
fixed in cold methanol:glacial acetic acid (3:1). The resulting
suspensions were dropped onto wet pre-warmed microscope slides
(37uC) along with a chromosome suspension from the human VA-
13+hTERC+hTERT cell line provided by Jerry Shay [108]. FISH
with a PNA-telomere probe was then performed as described above.
The abnormal karyotype of the VA-13+hTERC+hTERT cell
line is characterized by the presence of a cytogenetically
identifiable, duplicated marker chromosome that bears micro-
scopically visible interstitial telomeric repeats. The simultaneous
hybridization of human and zebrafish metaphases on the same
slide facilitated the use of specific interstitial human telomeres as
internal controls. Per condition, we assessed 468 telomeres
corresponding to 468 chromatids from 15-well spread metaphase
images that had no saturated signals. We measured each of the
chromatids in a preselected quarter of a metaphase plate (i.e. the
upper part of the metaphase between hours 12 and 3). All
chromatid telomeric signals of a particular area were measured
(whether visible or not). Sister chromatids were preferentially
measured. The values (A-values) of Fluorescence Intensity (FI), as
measured using the MetaSystems ISIS software and the TFL-
TELO software in the unprocessed image, were calculated taking
into account the overall measured area (MA) that was usually
similar for both sister chromatids (A-value = FI/MA). When only
one of the two sister chromatids had a detectable telomeric signal,
we used the MA of the sister chromatid with no telomeric signal
and measured the tip of the chromosome, utilizing its observed
morphology following DAPI staining. The mean measured area/
metaphase (mMA) was used when no telomeric signal at either end
of a particular chromosome could be observed. Hence, the lowest
and highest detectable values were equally and stochastically
represented by our measurements.
The Metasystems Isis software automatically adjusts for the
exposure time so most of the fluorescent spots per metaphase were
detectable when the number of saturated spots was kept as low as
possible. Our imaging system (based on a Zeiss Imager Z1 and a
Metasystems II videocamera) also showed great linearity between
the exposure time and measurable fluorescence intensity when
tested using fluorescent microbeads (Molecular Probes) prior to
undertaking the measurements in zebrafish. To correct for time
exposure variations, we took into consideration the exposure time
(t) which was unique for each metaphase so that the corrected B-
value = A-value/t. We then normalized the B-value, using internal
controls from four identical marker chromosomes with interstitial
telomeres (m1va13), which were co-hybridized on the same
microscope slide with the zebrafish specimen. We used inverted
DAPI banding and PNA-telomere FISH patterns to identify
duplicate copies of m1va13. We then measured, as indicated
above, the specific interstitial telomeres of four chromatids per
metaphase. The mean internal control value (IC-value) for 8
counts per slide, was measured as follows: Relative Telomeric
Fluorescence Intensity (RTFI) = B-value6IC-value.
Assessment of telomere lengths by terminal restriction
fragment Southern blotting
Genomic DNA was isolated from three embryos of each
genotype which were suspended in 100 ml of genomic DNA
extraction buffer [125 mM NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, 1% SDS,
10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.4 mg/ml Proteinase K] and agitated
at 50uC overnight. Genomic DNA was then purified by phenol-
chloroform and ethanol purification and 1 mg was digested with
HinfI and RsaI enzymes (Roche applied science), and resolved on
0.8% agarose gels in 16 TAE. The gels were then denatured,
blotted onto charged nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences),
and hybridized with a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled telomeric DNA
probe (59-CCCTAA-39)4 in DIG Easy Hyb (Roche Applied
Science). The membranes were washed twice in stringent wash
buffer 1 (26SSC and 0.1% SDS) for 15 min each, and twice again
in stringent wash buffer 2 (0.26SSC and 0.1% SDS) at 50uC also
for 15 min each. Telomere fragments were detected and visualized
using an anti-DIG-AP antibody (Roche Applied Science) and
CDP-StarH reagent (Roche Applied Science).
Whole-mount detection of apoptosis
Zebrafish embryos from 19 to 72 hpf were fixed overnight in
4% paraformaldehyde at 4uC and stored in 100% methanol at
220uC. Samples were then incubated in acetone at 220uC for
20 min, in 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate in PBS for
15 min, and then treated with 5 to 50 mg/ml proteinase K
(Invitrogen) for 5 to 25 min, depending on the embryo stages.
After fixation, the embryos were subjected to a TUNEL assay via
the ApopTagH Red in situ apoptosis detection kit (Chemicon),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Detection of apoptosis for circulating blood cells
To detect circulating blood cells, gata-1GFP
transgenic fish were
used. The gata-1GFP
fish embryos were fixed in 4% paraformal-
dehyde/PBS at 4uC overnight, and cryostat sections (10 mm) were
then generated and stained using an anti-GFP polyclonal antibody
(Wako) (1:500) and FITC-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (1:500).
After staining, apoptotic cells were further detected by the
TUNEL assay (Chemicon), and sample sections were then
counterstained by 0.5 mg/ml DAPI.
Measurement of circulating blood cells
For the quantification of circulating blood cell numbers in
caudal blood vessels, the numbers of blood cells in 0.5 mm of the
dorsal aorta were counted for at least 10 embryos from 28 to
72 hpf. In order to obtain a phenotypic score of the blood cell
number, each embryo was then scored according to the number of
circulating blood cells. The embryo groups were divided into three
classes based on their flowing blood cell numbers: i) indistinguish-
able from the control (.90%; No-change), ii) reduced in number
(10–90%; Reduction), or iii) severely deficient or almost no flowing
cells (,10%; Deficiency).
Whole-mount heme staining, histologic staining, and
Wright-Giemsa staining
Heme was detected by whole-mount o-dianisidine staining as
described previously [109]. Briefly, embryos under anesthesia were
stained in o-dianisidine solution [(0.6 mg/ml o-dianisidine,
0.01 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5), 0.65% hydrogen peroxide,
40% ethanol)] for 15 min in the dark. For histological observa-
tions, plastic sections (Technovit 8100, Heraeus Kulzer) were
made according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and stained with
hematoxylin-eosin. Embryonic blood was isolated by cardiac
puncture, and smeared onto glass slides and Wright-Giemsa
staining was performed as previously described [110].
Whole-mount in situ hybridization of embryos
For in situ hybridization, DIG-labeled antisense RNA probes
for zTERT cDNA and hematopoietic marker genes were

synthesized using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied
Science). For the controls, sense RNA-labeled probes were
synthesized. In situ hybridization of whole-mount zebrafish
embryos was then performed as described [111]. Briefly, prior to
hybridization, the embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
with PBS at 4uC for 15 h (overnight). Before staining, embryos
were rehydrated for 10 min in PBS-T containing 75, 50, and 25%
methanol and washed for 5 min in PBS-T. Hybridization with the
labeled RNA probes was carried out at 68uC overnight in
hybridization solution (50% formamide, 56 SSC, 0.5% yeast
RNA, 5% heparin, 0.1% Tween-20). Embryos were then
incubated for 30 min at room temperature with an anti-DIG
antibody (Roche Applied Science) (1:2,000). Colorimetric detec-
tion was carried out using BM Purple substrate (Roche Applied
Science). The reaction was stopped by washing in PBS, and then
the embryos were examined by a light-microscopy (SMZ-U,
Nikon).
Preparation of embryonic cells and FACS analysis
Embryonic cells from gata-1GFP
transgenic embryos were
collected as previously described [69]. Approximately 300
dechorionated embryos were collected in tubes containing
500 ml of a 16 Trypsin/EDTA solution, and were digested by
pipetting for 5 to 10 min. Digested cell suspensions were then
added to 1 ml of PBS containing 5% FBS and passed through a
70 mm nylon mesh filter. Cells were then collected by centrifu-
gation at 400 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in PBS/5% FBS
(1 ml). After centrifugation, cells were resuspended PBS/1% FBS
and 50 mg/ml propidium iodide. FACS sorting was performed
with a MoFlo flow cytometer (Dako Cytomation). After 2-time
sorting, GFP-positive cells were smeared on glass slides and
processed for Q-FISH analysis.
RNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted from 48 hpf zebrafish embryos using
TrizolH reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Invitrogen). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using M-
MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega), and PCR was performed
using ExTaq (Takara). For RT-PCR detection, the forward and
reverse primers used for zTERT were 59-AAACGCTTCTG-
CACCAAAGCTGAG-39 and 59-AGTGGTCAG-
GAACTCTGTGGCTTT-39, respectively. The primers for p53,
p21, mdm2 and b-actin have been previously described [73]. Other
primers that were designed for this study included: EF1a; forward,
59-ACCACCGGCCATCTGATCTACAAA-39 and reverse, 59-
ACGGATGTCCTTGACAGACACGTT-39, and Hspa9b; for-
ward, 59-ACATGAAGCTCACACGGTCTCAGT-39 and re-
verse, 59- AGCCACCAGATGACTGGATGACAA-39. Amplifi-
cation was performed at an initial denaturation step at 94uC for
5 min, followed by 25 cycles of 30 sec at 94uC; 30 sec at 60uC;
and 60 sec at 72uC, and a final extension step of 10 min at 72uC.
PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose, ethidium
bromide-stained gels, which were then imaged using a Multi
Image Light Cabinet (Alpha Innotech Corporation).
