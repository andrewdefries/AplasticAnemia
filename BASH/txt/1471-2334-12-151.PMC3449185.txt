Abstract
Background: Pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) often receive
intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) as antifungal prophylaxis. There are no guidelines for antifungal
prophylaxis in children in this situation. Caspofungin (CAS), a broad-spectrum echinocandin, could be an effective
alternative with lower nephrotoxicity than L-AmB.
Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of CAS in our center, and compared the
results with L-AmB as antifungal monoprophylaxis in pediatric patients undergoing HSCT. 60 pediatric patients
received L-AmB (1 or 3 mg/kg bw/day) and another 60 patients received CAS (50 mg/m2
/day) as antifungal
monoprophylaxis starting on day one after HSCT. The median ages of patients receiving L-AmB and CAS were
7.5 years and 9.5 years, respectively.
Results: No proven breakthrough fungal infection occurred in either group during the median treatment period of
23 days in the L-AmB group and 24 days in the CAS group. One patient receiving CAS developed probable invasive
aspergillosis. During L-AmB treatment, potassium levels significantly decreased below normal values. Patients
treated with L-AmB had more drug-related side effects and an increased need for oral supplementation with
potassium, sodium bicarbonate and calcium upon discharge as compared with the CAS group. CAS was well-
tolerated and safe in this cohort of immunocompromised pediatric patients, who underwent high-dose
chemotherapy and HSCT.
Conclusion: Prophylactic CAS and L-AmB showed similar efficacy in this biggest cohort of pediatric patients after
allogeneic HSCT reported, so far. A prospective randomized trial in children is warranted to allow for standardized
guidelines.

Background
Pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) are at high risk of acquiring se-
vere invasive opportunistic fungal infections. Risk factors
include extensive immunosuppression, cytopenia, T-cell
depletion of the graft, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD),
underlying disease and viral or bacterial infections [1,2].
Candida and Aspergillus species are the most common
fungal pathogens in this setting, with Aspergillus infec-
tions being associated with higher mortality [3-6]. Stud-
ies on intravenous antifungal prophylaxis regimens in
pediatric patients undergoing HSCT are scarce and
included 51 subjects or less. Hence, a variety of strat-
egies for the prophylaxis, empiric, pre-emptive and tar-
geted treatment of invasive fungal infections have been
published [7-10].
Pediatric patients (< 18 years) most frequently
received antifungal prophylaxis with liposomal ampho-
tericin B (L-AmB) after allogeneic HSCT [10-12]. How-
ever, nephrotoxicity or infusion-related side effects have

been reported in some studies in adolescents and adults
[13-15]. In a randomized, multicenter trial with 343 neu-
tropenic pediatric and adult patients empirically treated
with L-AmB, side effects included creatinine increase
(19% of cases), fever (17%), and rigor (18%) [16]. Macu-
lopapular rash, itching, and hyperphosphatemia were
reported in case reports of pediatric patients when
L-AmB was used [17,18].
Caspofungin (CAS) was shown to be effective in treat-
ment of invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis with low
toxicities in adults [19-21]. In children, CAS proved to
be effective in the primary treatment of candidiasis [22].
In retrospective studies of immunocompromised
pediatric patients, the safety and tolerability of CAS was
favorable [23,24]. The tolerability, safety, and efficacy of
CAS and L-AmB have also been compared in the empir-
ical antifungal treatment of febrile neutropenic pediatric
patients [25]. Based on these experiences, CAS was con-
sidered for antifungal prophylaxis with potentially fewer
nephrotoxic side effects than L-AmB and employed in
pediatric patients after allogeneic HSCT. Retrospectively,
we analyzed safety and efficiency of CAS and L-AmB.
Methods
This retrospective survey was conducted in accordance
with the declaration of Helsinki and performed with ap-
proval by the University Children’s Hospital Tübingen’s
Institutional Review Board. Data were collected retro-
spectively, entered in a standardized case report form,
and anonymized.
Study design
The study is a single centre, retrospective survey on
antimycotic prophylaxis in pediatric patients under
eighteen years of age who underwent allogeneic HSCT
between January 2006 and June 2010 at the University
Children’s Hospital Tübingen, Germany. The allogeneic
stem cell transplantation occurred in high-efficiency
particle-arrestance filtered environment. All pediatric
patients in our clinic received L-AmB exclusively as anti-
fungal prophylaxis during conditioning and after HSCT
until August 2008. As we observed a high incidence of
nephrotoxicity, we changed our antifungal prophylaxis
beginning from day 1 after allogeneic HSCT, from
L-AmB to CAS in September 2008. Other supportive
standards remained unchanged during this short period
of 4.5 years.
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate
safety of CAS as antifungal prophylaxis in pediatric
patients following allogeneic HSCT as compared to
L-AmB. The secondary objective was the incidence of
aspergillosis, candidiasis, and other mycoses.
The observation period in this trial was defined as the
time from start of intravenous antimycotic monoprophy-
laxis at the beginning of conditioning until three weeks
after switching to oral antimycotic prophylaxis 3–4 days
before inpatient discharge.
All 120 pediatric patients included in the survey
received antimycotic prophylaxis with L-AmB (1 mg/kg/
day) from the beginning of conditioning until day 0
(day of allogeneic HSCT) (Figure 1).
The first group of pediatric patients receiving stem cell
transplants between January 2006 and August 2008 also
received antimycotic prophylaxis with L-AmB after
HSCT beyond that point, with an initial dose of 1 mg/
kg/day. In case of fever greater than or equal to 38.5°C
after the first day post HSCT, which was interpreted as
the first clinical suspicion of a possible fungal infection,
further antimycotic prophylaxis with L-AmB monother-
apy was administered at 3 mg/kg/day, and was contin-
ued at that dosage up until oral antimycotic prophylaxis
a few days before the patient’s discharge.
The second group of patients, who had undergone
stem cell transplantation between September 2008 and
June 2010, received the same dosage as the pediatric
patients in group 1 until day 0, that is, they received
Figure 1 Overview of antimycotic prophylaxis regimens. The first group received antifungal monoprophylaxis with L-AmB, the second group
with CAS, both starting on day 1 after allogeneic HSCT.

L-AmB at a dosage of 1 mg/kg/day, and CAS at a dosage
of 1 × 50 mg/m2
/day intravenously beginning on day 1
after allogeneic HSCT, but not more than 50 mg/day,
even in cases of fever. This dosage was based on phar-
macokinetic studies, which showed that 50 mg/m2
/day
in children was comparable to 50 mg/day in adults, al-
though a further increase to 70 mg/m²/day (maximum,
70 mg/day) would have been possible [26,27]. A loading
dose of CAS was not given, since antimycotic prophy-
laxis had already been taking place since the start of
conditioning with L-AmB at a dosage of 1 mg/kg/day.
The infusion time of sixty minutes was the same for
each drug. L-AmB (AmbisomeW
) was manufactured by
Gilead Sciences (Martinsried, Germany) and CAS
(CANCIDASW
) by MSD Sharp & Dohme GmbH (Haar,
Germany). In addition to the systemic antifungal
prophylaxis, all of the patients involved in the survey
received an oral prophylaxis with amphotericin B
(AmphoMoronalW
) twice daily. An inhalation of antifun-
gals did not take place.
Study subjects
120 pediatric patients under eighteen years of age
with hemato-oncological malignancies, non-malignant
hematological diseases, and inborn errors of metabolism
undergoing allogeneic HSCT were included in this retro-
spective analysis. Exclusion criteria were the presence of
proven or probable invasive fungal infections before the
start of conditioning according to the definitions of inva-
sive fungal disease by the European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer Invasive Fungal
Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group
(EORTC/MSG) [28].
Efficacy analysis
Patients were examined daily for signs of invasive fungal
breakthrough infection on the ward and twice per week
for three weeks after switching to oral antimycotic
prophylaxis. At least once per week for the entirety of
the observation period galactomannan antigens were
measured by PLATELIA™ Aspergillus enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Munich,
Germany). In instances of positive galactomannan
antigens, measurements were repeated again with the
same blood specimen. After the confirmation of positive
results, daily measurements of the galactomannan
antigen took place, until a negative result was obtained.
Successful intravenous antifungal monoprophylaxis
was defined as the absence of proven or probable fungal
infection from the post-transplant period through the
date of discharge, as well as three weeks after the end of
intravenous antifungal monoprophylaxis.
Safety analysis
This endpoint was comprised of clinical and laboratory
parameters. Clinical side effects were recorded accord-
ing to current Common Toxicity Criteria by the US
National Cancer Institute [29]. Hepatic toxicity was
analyzed by assessment of alanine aminotransferase
(ALT, normal value ≤ 39 U/L) and aspartate aminotrans-
ferase (AST, normal value ≤ 39 U/L), alkaline phosphat-
ase (AP, normal value ≤ 320 U/L), total and direct
bilirubin in the patients’ sera. Renal function was
assessed by plasma creatinine (normal value ≤ 0.7 mg/dl),
urea (normal value ≤ 46 mg/dl) and potassium. Increases
of ≥ 1.5 and ≥ 2.5 times the normal values (beginning on
day 1 after allogeneic HSCT) were considered significant,
or with regard to potassium, a decrease of plasma
concentrations ≤ 3.4 mM or ≤ 2.4 mM. Furthermore, we
appraised the need for oral substitution of potassium,
bicarbonate, and calcium at discharge. We also assessed
if cessation of either prophylaxis was necessary due to
toxicity.
Statistical analysis
All 120 pediatric patients who received monoprophylaxis
with L-AmB or CAS were included in the assessments
of safety and efficacy. The statistical comparison of the
difference between the results and normal values was
done with the one-sample t-test. The Wilcoxon matched
pairs signed rank test was applied for a statistical com-
parison of these parameters: between the baseline before
conditioning and day 0, the baseline and maximum/
minimum during intravenous antifungal prophylaxis, the
baseline and end of intravenous antifungal prophylaxis,
day 0 and maximum/minimum, day 0 and end, and
maximum and end. The hepatic and renal function data
are presented as mean values ± standard deviation.
P values of ≤ 0.05 (*), P ≤ 0.01 (**) and P ≤ 0.001 (***)
were defined as statistically significant. The Two Inde-
pendent Proportion Z-Test was used to compare per-
centage of patients with hypokalemia during intravenous
antimycotic prophylaxis as well as the percentage of
electrolytes substitution between two groups. Graphs
were created with GraphPad Prism 4 for Windows,
version 4.03 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California,
USA). The statistical analysis was carried out with the
statistical program XLStat2010 (AddinSoft, Paris, France).
Results
Patients
In total, 120 pediatric patients under the age of eighteen
years, divided into two groups, were evaluated in this
analysis. All pediatric patients included in the survey, a
total of 60 patients in the first group and an additional
60 patients in the second group, received antimycotic
prophylaxis with L-AmB (1 mg/kg/day) from the

beginning of conditioning until day 0. The 60 pediatric
patients in group 1 underwent allogeneic HSCT between
January 2006 and August 2008, and received L-AmB at a
dosage of 1 mg/kg/day as antifungal prophylaxis from
day one after allogeneic HSCT. In 34 (56.7%) of the 60
pediatric patients in the L-AmB group, the antimycotic
prophylaxis with L-AmB was adjusted after HSCT to
3 mg/kg/day from the initial dosage of 1 mg/kg/day due
to fever greater than or equal to 38.5°C. The second
group also consisted of 60 pediatric patients, all of
whom were treated intravenously with CAS at a dosage
of 1 × 50 mg/m2
/day beginning on day one after allogen-
eic HSCT, but no more than 50 mg/day, between
September 2008 and June 2010. Fever greater than or
equal to 38.5°C came about in 27 (43%) of the 60
pediatric patients treated with CAS.
The median age in the L-AmB group was 7.5 years
(range 4 months to 17.6 years), while the CAS group
had a median age of 9.5 years (range 8 months to
17.5 years) (Table 1). Males were slightly over-
represented (L-AmB: n = 38, CAS: n = 33) in both
groups. The most common primary diagnoses in both
groups were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
(n = 18, n = 17) and solid tumors including Ewing sar-
coma, neuroblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 9,
n = 10). 28.3% (n = 17) of patients in the L-AmB group
and 25% (n = 15) of patients in the CAS group received a
myeloablative conditioning regimen with total body
irradiation.
Leukocytopenia was observed for a median duration of
12 days in both groups. 56.7% (n = 34) of the pediatric
patients in the L-AmB group and 21.7% (n = 13) in the
CAS group received methylprednisolone during condi-
tioning. 61.7% (n = 37) of patients in the CAS group
were treated with prednisolone after transplantation in
comparison to 38.3% (n = 23) in the L-AmB group. The
median duration of intravenous antifungal monoprophy-
laxis was approximately the same for each group,
23.0 days (range 9–72 days) in the L-AmB group and
24.0 days (range 14–49 days) in the CAS group after
allogeneic HSCT.
Evaluation of efficacy
Prophylaxis was effective with L-AmB as well as with
CAS. There was no incidence of proven invasive asper-
gillosis or another invasive fungal infection in either
group. This also remained true during the conditioning
phase, when both groups received liposomal amphother-
icin B, and also during the post-transplant period, in
which group one received L-AmB and group two CAS.
Furthermore, no proven fungal breakthrough infections
were observable in either group three weeks after the
conclusion of intravenous antifungal prophylaxis.
In the CAS group, one severely immunocompromised
pediatric patient showed clinical and serological indica-
tors of a probable invasive fungal infection, i. e. increase
of galactomannan antigen in more than two consecutive
blood samples and signs of pulmonary aspergillosis in
computed tomography thirteen days after start of

ary lavage failed to detect fungi by culture or PCR. The
patient died on day 94 after allogeneic HSCT of veno-
occlusive disease (VOD), the parents did not consent
with an obduction. There was no incidence of probable
invasive fungal infections in the L-AmB group.
None of the patients in both cohorts died from an in-
vasive fungal infection during the observation period. In
addition to the single pediatric patient from the CAS
group who succumbed to VOD, one patient from the
L-AmB group died from a relapse of AML three weeks
after the end of the intravenous antifungal prophylaxis.
Safety and tolerability
Clinical side effects directly related to intravenous treat-
ment with L-AmB were observed in 5 (8.3%) and dir-
ectly related to CAS in 2 (3.3%) pediatric patients
(Table 2). The clinical side effects in der L-AmB group
occurred equally as frequently in the pediatric patients
receiving L-AmB at a dosage of 1 mg/kg/day (n = 2) as
in those receiving 3 mg/kg/day (n = 3).
In the L-AmB group this included one incidence each
of fever, nausea, and bone pain, as well as two cases of
headache. L-AmB prophylaxis was discontinued in the
latter four of these cases and switched to CAS. In the

CAS group, fever occurred in one case and headache in
another. We did not stop the administration of a drug in
either of these two cases. Laboratory parameters of hep-
atic function showed a statistically significant, yet transi-
ent increase in ALT and AST in both groups, beyond
the upper normal limit during treatment post-
transplant in relation to baseline (P < 0.001) as well as
to day 0 (P < 0.001) (Figure 2). An increase ≥ 1.5 times
the normal value of 39 U/L occurred almost with the
same frequency in both groups for ALT (L-AmB:
n = 13, CAS: n = 14) and more frequently in the CAS
group for AST (L-AmB: n = 15, CAS: n = 19) (Table 2).
ALT values ≥ 2.5 times the normal value of 39 U/L were
observed in 3 patients under L-AmB and in 8 patients
under CAS. 6 patients in the L-AmB group and 2
patients in the CAS group showed AST levels at least
2.5fold above the normal limit. Total bilirubin and dir-
ect bilirubin also increased insignificantly during post-
transplant treatment. AP did not increase during post-
transplant period. In both groups, renal function para-
meters showed an increase in creatinine and urea during
treatment with L-AmB, but not significantly beyond the
upper normal limit. Hypokalemia ≤ 3.4 mmol/L occurred
significantly (P = 0.006) more often in the L-AmB group
(48 patients, 80%) than under CAS (34 patients, 57%)
(Figure 3).
Substitution requirement of electrolytes
A total of 25% (n = 15) of pediatric patients in the L-
AmB group required oral potassium supplementation
and spironolactone upon discharge. This compares to
only 11.7% (n = 7) in the CAS group. Sodium bicarbon-
ate substitution was required in 5 (8.33%) and calcium
in 3 (5%) cases upon discharge in the L-AmB group. In
the CAS group, calcium was given in 2 (3.3%) cases and
sodium bicarbonate in one (1.7%) case. In the L-AmB

group, there was a trend towards higher percentage of
patients requiring potassium (P = 0.0591) and bicarbon-
ate substitution (P = 0.094) after end of intravenous anti-
fungal prophylaxis. All pediatric patients in the L-AmB
group who required oral supplementation with potas-
sium and bicarbonate had received L-AmB after HSCT
at a dosage of 3 mg/kg/day.
Discussion
Clinical practice guidelines have been published and
adapted over the years for primary antifungal prophy-
laxis in adult patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT [7].
Yet primary antifungal prophylaxis in pediatric patients
is based solely on recommendations resulting from small
data sets reaching evidence categories of C-III or B-II
[10,23,24].
In our BMT unit, children receive a comparably low
dose of 1 mg/kg/day L-AmB during conditioning in
order to reduce drug interactions. When using L-AmB
at a therapeutic dosage (3 mg/kg/day) in pediatric
patients after allogeneic HSCT, we often observed an
increased need for supplementation of potassium, bi-
carbonate, and calcium during and within the first two
weeks following intravenous antifungal prophylaxis. In
a randomized, double-blind, multinational trial, CAS
was better tolerated than L-AmB in 556 adults with
persistent fever and neutropenia [30]. CAS in combin-
ation with other antifungal compounds, has been
proven an effective option for prolonged treatment
periods for invasive fungal infections in children and
adolescents [31-35]. A medical record review reported
the effectiveness and tolerability of CAS as primary
antifungal prophylaxis in 123 severely immunosup-
pressed adults undergoing stem cell transplantation
[36]. Therefore, we switched to CAS as primary
prophylaxis after conditioning for allogeneic HSCT. An
initial loading dose was not given since the pediatric
patients already received antifungal prophylaxis with
L-AmB during conditioning.
Although caspofungin showed good efficacy at a dos-
age of 50 mg/m2
/day up to a maximum of 50 mg/day,
the case of probable aspergillosis might argue to in-
crease the dose of caspofungin to 70 mg/m²/d (max-
imum, 70 mg/day) in children due to pharmacological
studies and its low toxicity [26,27]. The spectrum of
clinical drug-related side effects in this setting included
fever and headache during CAS treatment, but there
was no discontinuation of CAS administration. In a
prospective trial of pediatric patients (n = 49) with in-
vasive fungal infections, fever and rash were observed
during CAS treatment [22]. In our survey, five of the
patients who received L-AmB experienced fever, head-
ache, nausea, and bone pain. In four of these cases we
discontinued antifungal treatment with L-AmB. A tran-
sient increase of AST and ALT occurred in our and al-
most all other trials when pediatric patients received
CAS [22,24,34]. Creatinine and urea were not signifi-
cantly altered in both groups during and at the end of
Figure 3 Nephrotoxicity. Values are shown at baseline before conditioning (baseline), day 0, maximum during therapy (maximum / minimum),
and end of intravenous antimycotic monoprophylaxis (end) with L-AmB (open bars) and CAS (shaded bars). A: Mean and standard deviation (SD)
of serum creatinine (normal value ≤ 0.7 mg/dl), B: Urea (normal value ≤ 46 mg/dl), C: Potassium (normal value > 3.4 mmol/L). The horizontal line
shows the normal value. Statistical analysis by the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed Rank Test.

prophylaxis with L-AmB or CAS. However, an eleva-
tion in serum creatinine at the end of treatment in
17.7% of treatment courses with L-AmB was observed
in a single center prospective observational study of 84
pediatric patients and adults [10]. In the same study,
about 50% of pediatric patients had an electrolyte
wasting, defined as any hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia
or both. These results were consistent with our study:
the percentage of children with hypokalemia requiring
oral supplementation following L-AmB treatment was
significantly higher than after CAS treatment.
Conclusions
This is the first retrospective observational trial of anti-
fungal prophylaxis after allogeneic HSCT that has been
carried out with a large cohort of pediatric patients
under eighteen. In this retrospective survey, the efficacy
of antifungal prophylaxis was good in both groups,
since no proven invasive fungal infection occurred in ei-
ther group. During the early transplant period, patients
received several antibiotics and virostatics, which did
not affect the tolerability of CAS. The combination of
L-AmB with certain virostatics such as ganciclovir, fos-
carnet or cidofovir may have potentiated nephrotoxicity
requiring prolonged therapeutic intervention more often
here than in the CAS group. The present study is lim-
ited in that it was not randomized, and it retrospect-
ively analyzed two periods of time, where minimal
changes in daily management cannot be precluded. Pro-
spective studies with larger cohorts due to the low inci-
dence of invasive aspergillosis in this setting must be
undertaken in order to derive clinical guidelines on
antifungal prophylaxis in children undergoing stem cell
transplantation.
