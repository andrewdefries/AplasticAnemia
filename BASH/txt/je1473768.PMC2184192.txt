Work done in this laboratory (1-6) has shown that the anti-H-Y cytotoxic
response in mice is regulated by two or three genes in the H-2 complex: one of
these genes is located in the H-2K or H-2D region, and its products serve as the
associative structure for the H-Y antigen in the induction and effector phase of
T-cell cytotoxicity. Of the other types of regulatory genes, Ir genes, the
dominant gene of the H-2 b haplotype maps in the IA region, whereas the
complementary genes of other haplotypes map in the IC region. The presence of
these Ir genes is also necessary for anti-H-Y cytotoxicity to occur.
The rejection of syngeneic male skin grafts by females of various mouse
strains has been extensively studied (7), and it has been shown that the ability
of females to reject syngeneic male skin is largely determined by the H-2
complex (8, 9), but in some cases non-H-2 genes may have an effect on rejection
(8, 10, 11). Mapping data obtained by using inbred recombinant mouse strains
indicate that genes causing rapid rejection of syngeneic male skin grafts by
female mice localize near the K-end Ofthe H-2 b haplotype (12). Our findings on
the Ir gene regulation of the anti-H-Y cytotoxic cell formation now make the
comparison of these two phenomena possible.
Materials and Methods
Mice. All mice used were obtained from the breeding unit of the Division of Comparative
Medicine at the Clinical Research Centre, Harrow, England. Their H-2 haplotypes are indicated
in Table I.
Skin Grafting. Skin grafting was done as described by Billingham and Medawar (13). Full-
thickness skin grafts, ~-0.5 × 1.0 cm from the tail, were grafted onto the side of the thorax of the,
recipient, and protected for 9-11 days by a plaster bandage. Rejection was scored macroscopically
three times a week for 100 days. The results are expressed as a median survival time of the graft
(rejection in 50% of mice in a group). The statistical significance was determined by a computer-
ized log rank test (14).
Results
To compare the rejection of syngeneic male skin grafts with the induction of
anti-H-Y cytotoxic cell formation, we used the previously described methods to
examine the ability of various inbred mouse strains and their F1 hybrids to

mount an anti-H-Y cytotoxic response (1-6). In brief, female mice were primed
with male spleen cells intraperitoneally, or with a male skin graft, and spleen
cells from these mice were then restimulated in vitro in mixed lymphocyte
culture with the male spleen cells from the strain used for priming. Priming
with spleen cells or by skin grafting has always given identical results and, in
fact, there is evidence that in skin grafting, the passenger leukocytes are
responsible for the priming of the recipient (15). In Tables II-IV, the capacity of
cytotoxic cell production is indicated as positive or negative. The criteria for a
positive result are set out in the accompanying paper (6) and are shown in detail
in that paper.
Female mice of various inbred strains were first grafted with syngeneic male
skin. Early rejection was associated with the H-2 b haplotype: in B10 and in the
recombinant strains having a part of the H-2 b haplotype (B10.A(4R), B10.A(5R)
and HTI), the median survival time of the graft varied from 21 to 65 days (Table
II), but the differences between these strains were not statistically significant.
In all the other strains, only one or two grafts were rejected in 100 days (in
every group, P < 0.01 when compared to B10.A(5R) group). We used B10.HTG
mice instead of HTG, and the absence of rejection in these mice confirms the
findings of Gasser and Shreffler (11) that the male skin graft rejection by HTG
females is caused by genes outside H-2. Of those mouse strains able to reject
50% of skin grafts in less than 65 days, only B10 mice were able to mount a
secondary cytotoxic reaction against syngeneic male cells in vitro. Of the strains
unable to reject grafts, only C3H.OH was able to produce cytotoxic cells.
In studies on the dominance of the genes causing rapid skin graft rejection
(Table III), it was found that (B10 x BALB/c)F1 females rejected male skin
grafts from either parental strain, and this rejection was accompanied by the
ability to mount a cytotoxic response. Similar results have been obtained for
example with (B10 x CBA)F1 females (data not shown). The dominance of H-2 b
gene(s) in skin graft rejection was also seen in the experiments with (HTI x
B10.A(2R))F1 and (BALB/c x B10.A(5R))F1 females, but in contrast to the

their capacity to produce cytotoxic cells (Table IV).

combinations using noncongenic strains shown in Tables III and IV were tested

Discussion
The results show that the genes enabling rapid rejection of syngeneic male
skin grafts by female mice are not the same as those that enable the production
of H-2-restricted anti-H-Y cytotoxic cells. Thus, by using suitable recombinant
mouse strains and F1 hybrids, skin graft rejection without concomitant produc-
tion of anti-H-Y cytotoxic cell formation has been obtained and vice versa.
Table V shows a summary of these results. Only mice with all or part of the
H-2 b haplotype could reject grafts. The common part of the H-2 b haploytpe in
mice able to reject male skin grafts is.the IB region. Regardless of the presence
ofIB ~ in all of these strains, the variations in graft survival time indicate that
other parts of the H-2 may have a regulatory effect. These results are in
agreement with those of Bailey (12), but Bailey's orthotopic tailskin grafting
method is more sensitive. His graft survival times were thus much shorter than
ours, and some of our nonrejector strains could be classified as slow rejectors.
B10.A(SR) and HTI strains also have the IA b region which contains the Ir
gene(s) for anti-H-Y cytotoxic cell production (6), but both strains lack the
proper associative antigen for the induction of a cytotoxic response (we have
never obtained an anti-H-Y response associated with H-2K b- or H-2Dd-region
products). B10.A(4R), having IAk and IBb, are able to reject syngeneic male
skin grafts due to the presence of IBb, but they are unable to produce cytotoxic
cells due to the absence of IAb, regardless of the presence of appropriate
associative antigens (H-2Db and H-2Kk). This confirms a different localization
of those Ir genes controlling skin graft rejection and those enabling cytotoxic
cell production in mice carrying the H-2 b haplotype. Both of these genes show
dominant character, but the cytotoxic response needs the proper associative
antigen to occur, thus, for example (B10 x BALB/c)F1 females are able to reject

BALB/c male skin and to mount an H-2Kd-associated anti-H-Y cytotoxic
response. The lack of dominance of genes causing rapid skin graft rejection was
noticed in (B10 x A.TL)F1 females: they did not reject skin grafts from A.TL
males. It is noteworthy that A.TL mice, having H-2Ks and H-2Ddwith which H-
Y antigen cannot be associated in the cytotoxic reaction (5), were not able to
induce a cytotoxic response. So in this case, there is a concomitant absence of
cytotoxic cell formation and skin graft rejection. This was also true of (B10 x
A.TH)FI females, which did not reject male skin from A.TH (H-2K~, H-2Dd)
mice (data not shown).
If the H-2 b genes causing rapid skin graft rejection were absent and the
cytotoxic cells were produced by the interaction of complementary Ir genes (H-
2k/H-2 d, H-2k/H-2L and H-2q/H-2s complementations), male skin grafts were not
rejected. C3H.OH females grafted with syngeneic male skin were able to
produce a cytotoxic response but failed to reject the graft. The possible
mechanisms in cytetoxic cell formation in this strain are discussed in the
accompanying paper (6). Those F~ hybrids mentioned in Table IV were also
regrafted, but second-set rejection was not observed (data not shown).
In conclusion, it seems that H-2-restricted anti-H-Y cytotoxic T cells are
neither necessary nor sufficient for the rejection of syngeneic male skin grafts,
and that these two phenomena are even regulated by different genes. This was a
highly unexpected finding because in allograft rejection the cytotoxic T cells
are of prime importance, although the actual rejection phase is probably not an
autonomous T-cell function (16, 17). So we must assume that syngeneic male
skin graft rejection is mediated by a different mechanism which is not detectable
in vitro using the chromium release assay, and that anti-H-Y cytotoxic T cells
have no in vivo significance. One possibility is that H-2-restricted cytotoxic T
HURME, CHANDLER, HETHERINGTON, AND SIMPSON 773
cells are not directed against the correct antigen, and, in fact, there is recent
evidence that there are two H-Y antigens. Melvold et al. (18) found a mutant
(C57BL/6 × BALB/c)F1 male mouse lacking the H-Y antigen on the basis of
skin graft testing, but the serological tests for H-Y antigen were positive. This
mouse, from an X-irradiated father, had 39 chromosomes and the Y chromosome
was probably absent (a part of the Y chromosome was probably translocated to
an autosome). They suggested the existence of two H-Y antigens: H-Y1,
responsible for male-female graft incompatibility (part of the Y chromosome
coding for this antigen was missing in their mouse), and H-Y2, which is defined
by conventional serological means. This could explain why strains both which
do and which do not reject syngeneic male skin grafts may make an antibody
response against H-Y (19), implying that anti-H-Y1 and anti-H-Y2 responses
are under separate Ir gene control. If we use this hypothesis in explaining our
data, we must again assume that anti-H-Y1 response is not mediated by
cytotoxic T cells (i.e., is not detectable by chromium release assay) and that we
have been actually measuring the cytotoxicity against H-Y2. Anti°H-Y2 cyto-
toxicity might not be able to cause skin graft rejection on the basis of different
concentrations of H-Y1 and H-Y2 antigens on lymphocytes and epidermal cells.
Kralova and Demant (20) have suggested that the H-2 complex also regulates
the expression of the H-Y antigen, and the effect of these genes (mapping to the
left of IC) may be different on thymus and skin cells. For example, in B10.A(SR)
strain, the H-Y antigenicity would be strong on thymus cells but weak on skin
cells. Their results show that these genes in the H-2 k haplotype determine a
strong H-Y antigenicity on the skin, whereas the H-2 b haplotype is associated
with low antigenicity. In our experiments, these factors seem to have no effect
on skin graft rejection: (HTI x B10.A(2R))FI females rejected B10.A(2R) and
HTI male skin at the same rate (Table HI). To rule out the possibility that the
lack of anti-H-Y cytotoxic response in strains capable of graft rejection (e.g.
B10.A(5R)) was due to low H-Y antigenicity on lymphocytes (normal targets in
the 5~Cr-release assay), we used syngenic male 5~Cr-labeled epidermal cells as
targets, but these results were also negative (unpublished observations).
Whatever the rejection mechanism of syngeneic male graft is, it is evident
that the H-Y antigen has some significance in clinical transplantations. It has
been reported that female recipients of male kidney grafts survived longer than
did female recipients of female grafts (21). This might be attributed to anti-H-Y
antibody enhancement. But there are other studies which show that the H-Y
antigen is deleterious for graft survival. Goulmy et al. (22) found a patient with
aplastic anemia who rejected a bone marrow graft from her HLA-identical
brother, and her lymphocytes were cytotoxic to male cells, but restricted by an
HLA product in a manner analogous to the mouse system.
Summary
The ability of female mice to rapidly reject syngeneic male skin grafts is
largely determined by dominant genes in the IB region of the H-2 b haplotype,
whereas the ability to produce anti-H-Y cytotoxic cells is determined by a
dominant gene in the IA region of the H-2 b haplotype, or by complementary
genes in the IC region of some other haplotypes. Thus, it seems that H-2-

restricted anti-H-Y cytotoxic T cells are not responsible for the rejection of
syngeneic male skin grafts.
