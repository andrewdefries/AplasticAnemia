Grafts of normal and neoplastic hemopoietic cells fail or grow poorly in certain
lethally irradiated allogeneic mice, including F1 hybrid recipients of parental cells
(1-4). The manifestation of histoincompatibility in the latter host/donor com-
bination has been referred to as hybrid resistance, an apparent contradiction to
the classic laws of transplantation. A similar resistance to allogeneic bone marrow
cell (BMC)1 grafts has been shown to occur in other mammalian species (5-7),
and may contribute to clinical marrow graft failure in humans (8). The resistance
is effected by an unusual host-vs.-graft reaction that is radioresistant and inde-
pendent of the thymus (9-19). The sharing of numerous characteristics between
this resistance and natural cytotoxic activity in vitro against a broad range of
target cells suggests that the natural resistance to hemopoietic cells is mediated
by a subset of natural killer (NK) cells (13-15). Treatment of mice with antisera
with selective reactivity against NK cells indeed abrogates hemopoietic resistance
as well (16, 17). To date, however, the growing list of properties shared between
such resistance and NK cell activity does not include the single most pertinent
property of hemopoietic resistance, i.e., its immunogenetic specificity.
Hybrid resistance in mice is controlled by the hemopoietic histocompatibility
(Hh) loci, most of which are linked to the major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) of the mouse, the H-2 (reviewed in 18). One of the best known Hh loci,
Hh-1, is tightly linked to the H-2D region. It has been hypothesized that these
genes are noncodominantly expressed so that donor cells homozygous for a given
allele of an Hh locus are recognized as nonself and are rejected by F~ hybrid
recipients heterozygous for the same allele (9). In spite of its unorthodox
assumption of noncodominant, or co)recessive, inheritance of Hh genes (19), the
hypothesis successfully explains the genetic constraints of both hybrid and
allogeneic resistance (18). Direct evidence is still lacking, however, for the
existence of effector cells capable of specifically recognizing the putative Hh

antigens, thereby mediating parental marrow graft rejection. In fact, some recent
observations (20-22, 23) tend to support an alternative hypothesis that the
genetic specificity of hemopoietic resistance rests on regulatory mechanisms
rather than on the postulated recognition specificity of effector cells. These
observations include the findings that bone marrow cells from normal mice or
healthy humans are susceptible to NK cell-mediated cytolysis in vitro (20-22),
and that resistance to bone marrow allografts can be reconstituted by an NK-
like cell line (23). Moreover, the level of NK activity is in part controlled by
genes linked to the MHC (24-28).
Thus, definitive information on the recognition specificity of the effectors
mediating hybrid resistance is a prerequisite for the further understanding of
this and other natural resistance phenomena. To directly test the recognition
specificity of the effectors, an in vivo competitive inhibition assay has been
developed. The experiments described in this initial report used a panel of tumor
cells as inhibitors, several of which were chosen on the basis of susceptibility to
cytolysis by NK cells in vitro. The results provide the first direct evidence for
the existence of radioresistant effectors that specifically recognize cellular deter-
minants controlled by gene(s) within, or closely linked to, the H-2D region.
These effectors are reactive only with the H-2D homozygous tumor cells, an
indication of Hh-1 restriction of recognition.
Materials and Methods
Animals. Female C57BL/6N (B6), C57BL/10ScSn (BI0), C3H/HeN (C3H), DBA/
2, (C57BL/6 × DBA/2)F1 (B6D2F~), and B10.A mice were obtained from the Animal
Genetics and Production Branch, Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Insti-
tute. Female (C57BL/10 x C3H)F~ (B10C3F~) mice used were obtained from Health
Research Inc., West Seneca, NY. All other strains of mice used were bred in our own
colony, including B10.D2, BIO.A(2R), B10.A(4R), B10.A(5R), [B10.A × B10.A(2R)]F~,
and (BALB.B10 × BALB/c)F~. Bone marrow donors were 5-8 wk old and recipients
were 12-20 wk old.
Tumor cells. The following cell lines were maintained in vivo as ascitic tumors by serial
passage in syngeneic mice: benzpyrene-induced lymphoma EL-4 (H-2b, C57BL/6), radia-
b
tion-induced lymphoma L5MF-22 [H-2 , B10.129(5 M)], methylcholanthrene-inducedleu-

d [H-2b/a, (BALB.B10 × BALB/c)FI] (29), and Friend virus-induced myeloid leukemia
427E (H-2b/d,B6D2FI) (30). The followingradiation-induced lymphomaswere maintained
by serial passage in syngeneic mice as splenic tumors: LAF-17 (H-2a, B10.A), RDNM-27
(H-2a, B10.D2), LHM-14 [H-2h~,B10.A(2R)], L4RM-73 [H-2h4,B10.A(4R)], LIM-65 [H-
2i5, B10.A(5R)], and LBA × 2RM-80 (H-2a/h2, [B10.A × B10.A(2R)]F1). The Friend
virus-transformed bone marrow stem cell line 416B (H-2b/a, B6D2FI) (31), Moloney virus-
induced lymphoma YAC-1 (H-2a, A/Sn), Rauscher virus-induced iymphoma RBL-5 (H-
2b, B6), radiation-induced leukemia RL~-I (H-2a, BALB/c), and a subline of EL-4 (not
an interleukin 2 [IL-2] secreter) were maintained in vitro. The cell line HFLb/d was
originally a gift from Dr. T. V. Rajan. Both the 427E and 416B lines were a gift of Dr.
S. K. Ruscetti.
Irradiation. Recipient mice were exposed to 800-950 rad of a37Csgamma radiation
from a Gammacell 20 Small Animal Irradiator (Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd., Ottawa,
Canada) at a dose rate of 95 rad/min, 2-3 h before the intravenous injection of either
tumor or normal BMC. Tumor cells to be used as inhibitors were suspended in ice-cold
Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and exposed to I0,000 rad of ~37Csgamma radiation
using an Isomedix irradiator (model M-38-2; Isomedix Inc., Parsippany, NJ) at the dose
1134 H-2/Hh-RESTRICTED EFFECTORS OF NATURAL RESISTANCE
rate of 1,000 rad/min. Irradiated tumor cells were injected into mice within 30 min of
irradiation.
Treatment withPolyinosinic:PolycytidylicAcid (p-I:C). Lyophilized p-I:C (Sigma Chemical
Co., St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in HBSS at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Both lyophilized
and dissolved p-I:C were stored at -20°C. Mice were in'ectedLj py i n t r aeritoneali with 100
/zg of p-I:C 18 h before injection with BMC or [125I]5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine ([l~5I]-
IUdR)-labeled tumor cells (see below).
Splenic [125I]IUdR Uptake Assayfor Marrow Cell Proliferation. The standard assay for
proliferation of grafted hemopoietic cells in lethally irradiated recipients has been previ-
ously described (32, 33). The assay was modified, as required, to include an intravenous
injection(s) of irradiated tumor cells. Briefly, lethally irradiated recipient mice were
injected intravenously with inhibitor cells suspended in 1.0 ml of HBSS 3 h before the
intravenous injection of BMC, unless otherwise stated; in some experiments the time
interval between tumor and BMC injections was the variable to be tested. Viable cell
counts were made with a hemocytometer, based on trypan blue dye exclusion. The
proliferation of donor cells in the spleens of recipients was assessed 5-7 d later by
measuring the incorporation of [~sI]IUdR. 30 min before the intraperitoneal injection of
0.25 #Ci [~sI]IUdR (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL), each animal was injected
with 10-7 mol i.p. of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUdR) to reduce competition by endoge-
nous thymidylate. All animals were sacrificed 18 h after isotope injection and their spleens
removed and placed in glass counting vials. [l~sI]IUdR retention was measured with a
well-type gamma scintillation counter. The retention of [~sI]IUdR in the spleens was
expressed as a percentage of the injected isotope dose (% injected dose). Irradiated
syngeneic recipients served to measure the full growth potential of the grafted BMC. The
spleens of lethally irradiated mice not injected with BMC or injected with irradiated
tumor cells alone retained 0.01-0.03% of the injected isotope.
In Vitro [125I]IUdR Labeling of Tumor Cellsfor LocalizationStudies. Tumor cells to be
labeled were suspended at the concentration of 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supple-
mented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. FUdR (2 x 10-s mol) was added to 50
ml of cell suspension in each plastic petri dish and incubated for 20 min at 37°C in a 5%
COs incubator. 15 #Ci of [~sI]IUdR was then added to each culture dish and the cells
were incubated for an additional 18 h. The cells were harvested and washed extensively
with HBSS. They were resuspended in HBSS at a concentration of 106/ml and injected
intravenously into lethally irradiated recipients. At selected times after injection, the
animals were sacrificed, their spleens removed, and the amount of retained a~sI activity
in each spleen determined as described above.
Statistical Analysis. The data are expressed as geometric means of the percent of
injected [~25I]IUclR dose. Group comparisons were made using Student's t test for
geometric means. Differences between groups were considered significant when P was
_<0.05.
Results
Inhibition of Hybrid Resistance to Parental Bone Marrow Grafts by Irradiated Lym-
phoma Cells. Two examples of hybrid resistance are shown in Fig. 1. The growth
of parental B6 (H-2b) BMC in irradiated B6D2Fl (H-2b/d) recipients was impaired
as compared with that of the same cells grafted into irradiated syngeneic hosts
(Fig. 1A). In this FI hybrid recipient vs. parental donor combination, growth of
parental BMC was completely suppressed when graft size was below 1-2 x 106.
When the graft size was increased, proportionally more BMC escaped from
rejection and proliferated in the F1 host spleen. Similarly, grafts of parental B 10
(H-2b) BMC were resisted by irradiated B10C3F1 (H-2b/k) hosts (Fig. 1B).
However, resistance by B10C3F1 mice was somewhat weaker than that by
B6D2F1 mice, as judged by the partial escape from rejection of 2 × 106 or larger

FmORE 1. Inhibition of hybrid resistance against parental H-2bBMC grafts by irradiated H-
2b lymphoma cells. (A) Graded numbers of B6 BMC were injected into irradiated B6D2F, (A,
A) or B6 (O, O) mice, either without additional treatment (A, O) or after inoculation of 5 X
107 irradiated EL-4 cells 3 h earlier (&, O). Graded numbers of B6D2FI BMC were injected
into irradiated B6D2FI mice otherwise untreated ([]) or after inoculation of 5 X 107 irradiated
EL-4 cells 3 h earlier (1). [t25I]IUdR uptake in the recipient spleens was tested 5 d later. (B)

grafts in B10C3Ft hosts. In B6D2Ft mice, a comparable degree of escape from
rejection occurred only with 5 × 108 or larger grafts.
To test the ability of H-2 b lymphoma cells to inhibit resistance to parental H-
2b BMC, EL-4 cells of B6 origin or L5MF-22 cells of B10.129(5M) origin were
exposed to 10,000 rad of 3' irradiation and injected at a dose of 5 × 107 cells/
mouse into irradiated B6D2FI or B10C3Fx mice, respectively, 3 h before trans-
plantation of graded numbers of parental BMC. Partial (Fig. 1A) or complete
(Fig. 1B) inhibition of hybrid resistance by irradiated lymphoma cells ensued, as
indicated by higher levels of splenic [125I]IUdR uptake 5 d later in the lymphoma-
injected hosts as compared with the hosts grafted with BMC alone. Residual
DNA synthesis by irradiated lymphoma cells, if any at all, did not contribute to
the increase in [125I]IUdR uptake for the following reasons. First, irradiated mice
injected with these lymphoma cells but not BMC failed to incorporate [125I]IUdR
above the levels of incorporation (0.01-0.03% splenic uptake) in irradiated
control mice not grafted with cells (data not shown). Second, aliquots of the same
irradiated lymphoma cells had no effect on [125I]IUdR uptake by irradiated hosts
given syngeneic BMC grafts (Fig. 1, A and B). The relative effectiveness of the
inhibition of rejection, as measured by the increase in [12~I]IUdR uptake, was
greatest for the BMC dose at the inflection point of resistance. The data also
indicate a higher inhibition efficiency by the same number of lymphoma cells
against the weaker resistance of B 10C3FI than that of B6D2F1 mice. Fifty million
inhibitor cells allowed the growth of B6 BMC in B6D2Ft mice to an extent
substantially below that in syngeneic B6 hosts (Fig. 1A), but the growth of B10
1136 H-2/Hh-RESTRICTED EFFECTORS OF NATURAL RESISTANCE
BMC in B10C3F~ was raised by the same number of inhibitor cells to a level
comparable to that in syngeneic B 10 hosts (Fig. 1B). The two H-2b lymphomas
EL-4 and L5MF-22 were indistinguishable in their inhibitory capacity when
simultaneously tested in the same F~ recipient/parental BMC donor combinations
(data not shown). Irradiated EL-4 cells from the same pool were also injected
into irradiated B6 and B6D2FI recipients of syngeneic BMC grafts. The effect
of EL-4 cells on syngeneic BMC growth, if any, was a slight, statistically insignif-
icant depression rather than an enhancement of growth. Presumably, this was
due to a nonspecific crowding effect, since the injection of unrelated lymphoma
cells resulted in a similar degree of depression (data not shown), Similarly,
injection of L5MF-22 cells had no effect on the growth of B 10 BMC in syngeneic
hosts.
Dependence of Inhibition on the Number of Irradiated Lymphoma Cells and the Time
of their Injection. Lethally irradiated B6D2FI mice were inoculated with graded
numbers of irradiated EL-4 cells 3 h before the injection of either 5 x 105, 2 x
10 6, or 7 X 106 B6 BMC. B6D2F1 recipients given only the B6 BMC served as
controls. The three doses of B6 BMC were chosen to cover the three identifiable
levels of resistance indicated by the data in Fig. 1A, i.e., complete suppression of
the growth of 5 x 10~ parental BMC, the inflection point at 2 X 106 cells, and
the partial escape of 7 x 106 B6 BMC from rejection. The inhibition of BMC
rejection by EL-4 cells was dependent on both the BMC dose and the EL-4 cell
dose (Fig. 2). With 2 x 106 or 7 x 106 B6 BMC, inhibition was a linear function
of the EL-4 cell dose. However, with 5 X 105 BMC, substantial inhibition
occurred only when 5 x 107 or higher numbers of EL-4 cells were injected, an
indication that irradiated EL-4 cells compete with B6 BMC as targets for
rejection. If this interpretation is correct, it is expected that the time of inhibitor

cell injection relative to BMC grafting should critically influence the effectiveness
of inhibition. To test this, 5 × 106 B6 BMC were injected into irradiated B6D2FI
mice and 107 irradiated EL-4 cells were injected once, twice, or three times
within 24 h before or after BMC grafting. The relatively low dose of EL-4 cells
was selected to facilitate comparisons among the different experimental groups.
1138 H-2/Hh-RESTRICTED EFFECTORS OF NATURAL RESISTANCE
The results are summarized in Table I. A single dose of EL-4 cells was effective
only when it was given 3 h before BMC transplantation (cf., groups 3, 4, and 5).
When mice were given EL-4 cells 3 h before BMC grafting, an additional dose
24 h before BMC grafting augmented inhibition but one 24 h after BMC injection
did so only slightly (cf., groups 6 and 7 with group 4). The regime of three doses
of inhibitor cells was the most effective, but relatively little was gained over the
two doses at -24 and -3 h (cf., groups 6 and 8). These data suggest that EL-4
cells must be present in the spleen simultaneously with the target BMC for
inhibition to take place, and that the critical phase of BMC rejection is complete
within 24 h of grafting. Additional data presented later (Fig. 3) lend further
support to these conclusions.
Specificity ofInhibition ofHybrid Resistance by Irradiated Tumor Cells. The kinetic
data presented thus far strongly suggest that the inhibition of hybrid resistance
by H-2b lymphoma cells is due to the competitive inhibition of resistance at the
level of target cell recognition by the effector cells mediating this resistance. To
substantiate this interpretation and to analyze the recognition specificity of the
effectors, lymphoma and other tumor cells of standard H-2 haplotypes were
tested for their inhibitory capacity. Among the tumor cell lines tested were NK-
susceptible YAC-1, RBL-5, and RLd-1, and three H-2 heterozygous lines. One
of the latter, 416B, is highly susceptible to NK-mediated cytolysis in vitro
(unpublished observation). As shown in Table II, cells of the H-2d (L1210 of
DBA/2, RLd-1 of BALB/c), H-2a (YAC-1 of A/Sn), and H-2k (GL-1 of C3H)
haplotypes were unable to inhibit the resistance of B6D2FI mice to parental B6
BMC, but another H-2b lymphoma, RBL-5 (B6 origin), was nearly as inhibitory
as EL-4 cells. Since the NK-susceptible lymphoma cells were maintained by in
vitro passage, an in vitro subline of EL-4 was used in experiment II. The H-2b/d
heterozygous "stem cell" line 416B and myeloid leukemia 427E of B6D2F~ bone
marrow origin were noninhibitory, as were erythroleukemic cells HFLb/d of
(BALB.B 10 × BALB/c)F1 origin. These data indicate that the inhibitory capacity
of tumor cells is associated with the H-2b haplotype, that the H-2b haplotype
must be in the homozygous state to be inhibitory, and that susceptibility to NK-
mediated cytolysis in vitro is irrelevant for inhibitory capacity in vivo.
In the next series of experiments, B10C3F~ mice were grafted with parental
B10 BMC and tested for inhibition of resistance by radiation-induced iymphoma
cells from congenic strains of mice with informative H-2 haplotypes. Since the
lymphoma lines used were splenic rather than ascitic, the L5MF-22 cells used as
the positive control for inhibition were from the splenic line from which the
ascitic subline used in earlier experiments was derived. Growth characteristics of
the splenic lymphomas were comparable. The results of three representative
experiments are shown in Table III. Though the efficiencyof inhibition by these
splenic tumors was lower than that by ascitic tumors, the presence or absence of
inhibitory activity was always clearly demonstrable. The H-2a (LAF-17 of B! 0.A)
and H-2d (RDNM-27 of B10.D2) cells were ineffective as inhibitors. Cells with a
recombinant haplotype carrying the b allele in the D region only [LHM-14 of
B10.A(2R)] or in the D end regions [L4RM-73 of B10.A(4R)] were inhibitory,
but those cells carrying the b allele in the K end only [LIM-65 of B10.A(5R)]
were noninhibitory. LBA × 2RM-80 lymphoma cells that were derived from a

Effect of the Interferon Inducer Polyd:C on Hybrid Resistance and the Spec~city of
Inhibition. Since interferon (IFN) is known to have an antiproliferative effect
on hemopoietic bone marrow-derived cells (34), the effect of a single injection
of p-I:C 18 h before BMC grafting was tested in syngeneic transplantation (Table
IV, Exps. I and II). Although the growth of syngeneic BMC in p-I:C-treated
recipients had a tendency to be slightly less than that in untreated recipients, a
statistically significance difference was not observed under the experimental
conditions in the strains of mice used. In contrast, growth of parental BMC was
markedly reduced in p-I:C-treated F1 hosts as compared with untreated F~ hosts,
indicating an amplification of resistance by p-I:C treatment (Exp. III). At this
dose of parental BMC (5 × 106), the resistance in untreated recipients was partial
and, hence, amenable to augmentation. Since p-I:C or IFN augments the cytolytic
activity (35-37) and the target-binding capacity of NK cells for some targets (38),
the specificity as well as the extent of inhibition of hybrid resistance by various
tumor cells was tested. The specificity of inhibition was unaltered by p-I:C
treatment of recipients, including the inability of NK-susceptible YAC-1 cells to
inhibit parental BMC graft rejection (Exp. III). The extent of the inhibition by
EL-4 cells was reduced, presumably because the inhibition is a function of the
strength of resistance (Fig. 1).

Splenic Localization ofInhibitory and Noninhibitory Lymphomas. It was conceivable
that the inhibitory capacity of certain lymphoma cells and its absence in others
depended on the ability to localize in the host spleen, rather than on the H-2
haplotype. In addition, the reduced efficiency of inhibition in p-hC-treated hosts
could reflect a lower efficiency of splenic localization of lymphoma cells in the
treated than in the untreated hosts. To test these possibilities, the frequency of
splenic localization was studied for selected inhibitory and noninhibitory tumor
cells in untreated as well as p-I:C-treated F1 recipients. Between 1 and 2% of
[125I]IUdR-labeled tumor cells localized in the spleen 1-2 h after injection,
irrespective of their capacity to inhibit hybrid resistance (Fig. 3). Thus, nonin-
hibitory L1210 (Fig. 3B) and YAC-1 and GL-1 cells (Fig. 3C) localized in F1
spleens at about the same time and frequency as inhibitory EL-4 or L5MF-22
cells (Fig. 3A). Pretreatment of recipient mice with p-I:C did not substantially
alter this pattern, although there was a trend for a higher initial localization
frequency and a more rapid clearance of tumors from the spleens of treated than
untreated mice. These characteristics were remarkably reproducible in inde-
pendent experiments included, or not included, in Fig. 3. It was also apparent,

not unexpectedly, that some minor differences exist among different tumor cells.
For example, L1210 cells seemed to reach the spleen more slowly than EL-4,
L5MF-22, YAC-1, or GL-1 cells, while both YAC-1 and GL-1 cells seemed to be
cleared more rapidly from the spleen than either EL-4, L5MF-22, or L1210
cells. However, these characteristics did not obviously correlate with either the
ability to inhibit parental H-2b BMC rejection or susceptibility to NK-mediated
cytolysis, at least within the 24 h observation period.
Discussion
The experiments described in this paper were undertaken to answer one of
the most basic questions regarding the enigmatic phenomenon known as hybrid
resistance, i.e., whether the immunogenetic specificity of resistance reflects the
recognition specificity of putative effector cells. We addressed this issue through
a new approach. The results show that inhibition in situ of hybrid resistance by
irradiated tumor cells depends on (a) the strength of resistance, (b) the parental
BMC graft size, (c) the inhibitor cell dose, (d) the time of inhibitor cell inoculation
relative to bone marrow transplantation, and (e) the inhibitor cells' H-2 haplotype
and homozygosity. It is unlikely that characteristics of tumor cells not associated
with the H-2 haplotype, such as the cell size, splenic localization frequency,
possible lymphokine or cytotoxin secretion, or the presence of alloreactive T
lymphocytes accompanying in vivo-derived tumor cells that could be activated
to secrete lymphokines, played a substantial role. Although not all of the 16
1142 H-2/Hh-RESTRICTEDEFFECTORS OF NATURAL RESISTANCE
tumor lines used were tested for their effect on BMC transplantation in syngeneic
donor/recipient combinations, there was no evidence for nonspecific growth
enhancement or suppression other than a slight depression in growth attributable
to initial physical crowding. The frequency of splenic localization was also
comparable so far as those cell lines tested were concerned. The H-2 haplotype
and homozygosity were consistently the most critical factors determining the
inhibitory capacity, regardless of whether the tumor cells in question were
derived from in vivo or in vitro lines. The latter tumors were unlikely to contain
immunocompetent cells, since all of them had been passaged in vitro for a
number of years before being tested in this study. The tumor lines used in this
study were chosen primarily for theivavailability in our laboratory, convenience,
H-2 haplotype of the strain of origin, and NK susceptibility; no other tumor lines
were tested or excluded for unexpected behavior. In addition, the genetic
specificity of inhibition observed in this study has been confirmed and extended
by using normal hemopoietic cells as inhibitors (Daley and Nakamura, manuscript
in preparation).
The inhibition of hybrid resistance by irradiated tumor cells could result from
direct competition with parental BMC at the level of the effectors. Alternatively,
inhibition could conceivably occur via determinant-specific regulatory cells mod-
ulating a nonspecific effector mechanism. For example, inhibitory cells may
stimulate the reactive host cells to release nonspecific growth factors for trans-
planted hemopoietic cells, or in some way cause suppression of nonspecific
rejection, cell-mediated or otherwise. The data provided in the present study
suggest, however, that the inhibition is unlikely to have a two-step mechanism.
Firstly, inhibitory tumor cells had no effect on the growth of F~ BMC grafted
into syngeneic F~ hosts. The release of nonspecific growth factor(s) or the
suppression of nonspecific effectors should have caused enhanced growth of F~
BMC if either of these mechanisms was operative. Secondly, NK-susceptible
tumor cells not bearing homozygous H-2Db alleles had absolutely no detectable
influence on the growth of parental BMC in F~ hosts. If nonspecific effectors
with NK-iike reactivity played a role in hybrid resistance, one would expect NK-
sensitive tumor cells to have at least some impact. It seems reasonable to conclude,
therefore, that the inhibition of hybrid resistance observed in this study reflects
specific competitive inhibition at the level of the effectors mediating the resist-
ance.
The present data have several interesting implications for the nature of the
effector cells and the target antigens recognized in natural bemopoietic resist-
ance. Most importantly, the results have confirmed the presence, in responder
FI mice, of radioresistant effector cells that specifically recognize H-2Db/Hh-1 b
homozygous BMC and promptly eliminate them or suppress their proliferation,
as proposed in the original hypothesis (9). The effector cell activity could not be
blocked by H-2Db/Hh-lb-negative tumor cells, including NK-susceptible YAC-1
(H-2a), RLc~-I (H-2a), or 416B that is heterozygous for H-2b. Some alloreactive
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones have been shown to have a dual reactivity,
one of which is MHC-restricted and the other, nonrestricted but directed to cell
surface structures of NK-sensitive lymphomas (39). The coexistence of two
independent recognition structures on some of these CTL clones has recently
DALEY AND NAKAMURA 1143
been demonstrated, but the binding of CTL to target cells through one type of
receptor was found to block the binding through the other type of receptor (40).
The effectors mediating hybrid resistance did not exhibit such competitive
binding, even under conditions that could have increased their binding capacity
for NK-susceptible target cells, i.e., p-I:C pretreatment of the hosts. Therefore,
barring the possibility that the effectors for resistance somehow manage to bind
NK-sensitive lymphoma cells without impeding their ability to bind parental
BMC, these effectors do not appear to have a dual recognition specificity. The
relationship between the effectors of natural hemopoietic resistance and NK cells
requires reassessment in the light of these data. Some of the shared properties
of natural hemopoietic resistance and NK cell activity may only reflect a require-
ment for the same accessory functions. It is possible that the effectors of
hemopoietic resistance do belong to a subset or a differentiation stage of NK
cells, adding another dimension to the known heterogeneity of this class of
effector cells. Alternatively, hemopoietic resistance may be mediated by a new
class of effector cells whose function depends in some way on interactions with
NK cells. Further studies are needed to distinguish these possibilities and establish
the identity of the resistance-mediating effectors. The augmentation of hybrid
resistance by p-I:C is mediated by IFN, since semipurified IFN-~ is also effective
and anti-IFN-/3 antiserum can abrogate the augmentation (Cudkowicz et al.,
unpublished data). Xenogeneic hemopoietic resistance has been shown to be
potentiated by p-I:C (41).
Our observations may seem at odds with the results of several recent studies.
For instance, lysis of human BMC by autologous or allogeneic NK cells in vitro
can be inhibited by NK-susceptible K562 erythroleukemic cells (21), and lysis of
NK-sensitive YAC-1 lymphoma targets was blocked by regenerating murine
hemopoietic cells syngeneic to NK cells (22). Assuming that the blocking was
due to competitive binding with effector cells, the results would indicate that the
same NK cells are reactive with normal hemopoietic cells as well as genetically
unrelated lymphoma cells. In our view, the target structures recognized in these
studies are unrelated to the determinants controlled by Hh genes or their human
counterpart. The transferrin receptor has recently been suggested as a candidate
for such structures (42). The ability of a cell line with NK-like reactivity to
reconstitute resistance in vivo to allogeneic marrow grafts seems to contradict
the present data, since these NK-like cells do not show immunogenetic specificity
in vitro but appear to mediate specific allograft rejection in vivo (23). It remains
to be seen, however, whether these NK-like cells directly function as effectors in
vivo, or these cells secrete IFN-'r and activate or recruit endogenous effectors.
Although the recognition specificityof effector cells mediating allogeneic marrow
graft resistance has not been investigated in detail, our preliminary data suggest
that these effectors, too, have immunogenetic specificity. In another study (43),
lysis of EL-4 cells in vitro by NK-like splenic effectors of an F1 hybrid origin was
inhibited by YAC-1 cells, and vice versa. However, unlike the hemopoietic
resistance in vivo (44), the in vitro activity was not dependent on bone marrow
integrity (43, 45), suggesting that the in vitro cytotoxicity is mediated by effectors
distinct from those analyzed in the present study.
It is often implicitly assumed that hybrid resistance to parental BMC and
1144 H-2/Hh-RESTRICTED EFFECTORS OF NATURAL RESISTANCE
lymphoma cells is mediated by the same effectors, based on a similar genetic
control over resistance to these cells. It is probable that hybrid resistance against
tumor cells involves a variety of mechanisms (46-48). In some cases, however,
the assumption of identical effectors seems valid (9). The present data indeed
provide the first direct demonstration that the effectors mediating resistance to
parental BMC are reactive with parental or other tumors of the H-2Db/Hh-1 b
genotype. This observation may seem to contradict the reported failure to block
hybrid resistance against a parental H-2b lymphoma by inoculation of irradiated
normal spleen cells from H-2b mice (49). The disagreement is probably more
apparent than real, since several simple explanations are possible, such as higher
density of target antigens on tumor cells than on normal splenocytes, relatively
low frequencies of antigen-bearing cells among splenocytes of unmanipulated
mice, or an insufficient inhibitor cell dose.
The results of this study offer some initial insight on the nature of the cell
surface antigens recognized by the effectors of hybrid resistance. The consistent
failure to inhibit parental marrow graft rejection by four independent lines of
H-2Db heterozygous cells indicates that the target antigens are either not ex-
pressed on these cells or expressed at such low levels as to be undetectable by
the assay. These data are in contrast with those obtained with F~ antiparental H-
2b CTL. In the latter, direct cytolysis is detectable only on H-2Db homozygous
target cells, but the lysis of such targets can be effectivelyand specifically inhibited
by H-2Db heterozygous cells, including F1 hybrid cells syngeneic with the CTL
(50). These data and the fact that monoclonal antibodies specific for Dbmolecules
block the lysis of parental target cells (Nakamura, unpublished observations),
indicate that FI antiparent CTL recognize determinants controlled by class I
genes. The present results with H-2Db heterozygous cells are consistent with the
hypothesis that the effectors of resistance recognize Hh-1 b antigens expressed
only on homozygous cells, rather than self antigens restricted by H-2Db. How-
ever, a note of caution is necessary for this interpretation. Since the present
study used intact F~ hosts, the effectors were surrounded by an excess of
endogenous H-2 heterozygous cells. Should the endogenous cells express small
amounts of target antigens, exogenous H-2 heterozygous inhibitors might not
exert additional effects over preexisting partial autoinhibition. It is conceivable,
therefore, that hybrid resistance represents a form ofautoreactivity that becomes
detectable in intact F1 hybrid mice only when homozygous target cells are tested.
Further comparisons between the recognition specificity of F1 antiparent CTL
and that of the effectors mediating hybrid resistance will be useful in determining
whether the putative Hh-1 b antigen is distinct from the known class I gene
products. Discordant genetic patterns between the two F~ hybrid antiparent
reactivities have already been pointed out (51). In a series of ongoing studies,
normal hemopoietic cells from a panel of inbred strains of mice have been used
as inhibitors for hybrid resistance against parental H-2b BMC. The results so far
indicate that the effector specificity is consistent with the known strain distribu-
tion and properties of Hh-1 alleles and not with class I H-2 specificities defined
by serological reagents, allogeneic anti-H-2Db, or F1 antiparental H-2Db CTL
(Daley and Nakamura, manuscript in preparation). Analyses of effectors respon-
sible for hybrid resistance against parental BMC from various H-2d strains of
DALEY AND NAKAMURA 1145
mice are also in progress. Since the Hh loci defined by H-2d strains of mice have
been identified either at some distance from the D end of the H-2 complex or
not linked to the H-2 (18), such studies should be particularly informative.
Summary
The natural resistance of Fa hybrid mice against parental bone marrow grafts
is thought to be mediated by natural killer (NK)-like effector cells. However,
unlike the NK cell activity against a wide range of tumors and normal cells,
hybrid resistance is characterized by the immunogenetic specificity controlled by
a set of unique noncodominant genes denoted as Hh. Two alternative hypotheses
can account for the specificity. Thus, the specificity may reflect either the Hh
restriction of effectors or the Hh gene control of mechanisms regulating non-
Hh-restricted effector activity. In this study, therefore, we tested the recognition
specificity of putative effectors mediating hybrid resistance in lethally irradiated
H-2b/d and H-2b/k F~ hybrid mice to the engraftment of parental H-2b bone
marrow. As a direct means of defining the effector specificity, rejection of
parental bone marrow grafts was subjected to competitive inhibition in situ by
irradiated tumor cells. Of the 16 independent lines of lymphoma and other
hemopoietic tumor cells tested, the ability to inhibit hybrid resistance was the
exclusive property of all tumors derived from mice homozygous for the H-2Db
region, regardless of whether the tumor cells were susceptible or resistant to NK
cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. Four cell lines heterozygous for the H-2Db
were noninhibitory, including one that is susceptible to natural killing. Pretreat-
ment of the FI hosts with an interferon inducer augmented the resistance with
no alteration in the recognition specificity of effector cells. Therefore, natural
resistance to parental H-2b bone marrow grafts was mediated by effectors
restricted by the H-2Db/Hh-1 b gene(s), and not by the nonrestricted NK cells
detectable in conventional in vitro assays.
