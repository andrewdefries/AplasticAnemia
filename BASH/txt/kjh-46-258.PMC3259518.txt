Background
The effects of chimerism on outcomes following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell trans-
plantation (HSCT) are unclear and may differ between diseases. We retrospectively eval-
uated the association between chimerism and transplant outcomes in children with non-
malignant diseases.
Methods
Chimerism was evaluated using short-tandem repeat polymerase chain reaction
(STR-PCR) in 48 patients, with mixed chimerism (MC) defined as greater than 1% recipient
cells.
Results
The only variable exerting a significant influence on patients’ chimerism status was the
number of infused CD34＋ cells. MC was detected in 23 transplants (9 showing transient
MC; 10 with sustained low levels [≤30%] of autologous cells; and 4 with high-level MC
[＞30%]). The degree of STR-PCR at 28 days after HSCT was significantly higher in patients
with high-level MC than those with transient or low-level MC. All patients with transient
or low-level MC successfully maintained engraftment and showed a clinical response to
HSCT, whereas 2 of the 4 patients with high-level MC experienced graft failure. The in-
cidences of grades II-IV acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were sig-
nificantly higher in patients with complete donor chimerism (CC) than MC. We observed
no significant survival differences between CC and MC groups. However, the survival
rate was lower in patients with high MC than those with low-level or transient MC
(P=0.03).
Conclusion
In non-malignant diseases, MC may indicate a tolerant state with a decreased incidence
of GVHD. However, high-level MC may signify an increased risk of graft failure and a lower
survival rate.

INTRODUCTION
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(Allo-HSCT) is a well-established treatment for several non-
malignant diseases, including severe aplastic anemia (SAA),
inherited bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes, im-
munodeficiencies, and metabolic disorders [1]. Although
complete donor hematopoiesis is a desirable outcome of al-
lo-HSCT in malignant disorders, complete replacement of
the recipient’s hematopoietic system is not considered neces-
sary to improve the underlying disease state in patients with
non-malignant disorders. This coexistence of host and donor
hematopoietic cells is known as mixed chimerism (MC).
Rates of graft failure and rejection are high in patients
with non-malignant diseases [2, 3]. MC has been linked
to graft rejection [4, 5], suggesting that early testing for
posttransplant chimerism may help to identify patients at
increased risk of graft rejection, who may therefore require
immunotherapy [6]. Although patients with a significant

proportion of host cells are known to be at increased risk
of rejection in cases of malignant disease, only a few studies
have focused exclusively on children with non-malignant
diseases [7, 8]. Furthermore, the utility of chimerism in pre-
dicting subsequent transplant outcomes in non-malignant
diseases has not yet been established.
The main aims of this study were to identify the variables
affecting chimerism and to determine the impact of MC
on transplantation outcomes in patients undergoing al-
lo-HSCT for non-malignant diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
1. Patients and donors
Between April 2000 and March 2011, 48 children under-
went 50 allo-HSCTs for non-malignant diseases at the Asan
Medical Center Children’s Hospital in Seoul, Korea. In this
study, we analyzed the initial HSCT data from all patients.
Median age at first HSCT was 8.4 years (range, 0.6-20.5
years), and the median duration of follow-up was 41 months
(range, 8-138 months). Diseases were classified as BMF or
non-BMF. All donor-recipient pairs were fully typed for
HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DR using high-resolution molecular
typing. As a surrogate marker of iron overload at the time
of transplantation, serum ferritin was routinely measured
as a part of the pretransplant work-up before the beginning
of the conditioning regimen using a 2-site sandwich immuno-
assay with direct chemiluminescence (ADVIA Centaur,
Siemens). All patients were stable, without fever or other
events, suggesting that pretransplant ferritin levels are a good
estimator of iron status and are not significantly affected
by an inflammatory state. Data were analyzed in October
2011. The demographic and clinical characteristics of patients
and donors are summarized in Table 1. This retrospective
study was approved by the institutional review board at
the Asan Medical Center in Seoul, Korea.
2. Graft-versus-host disease
Acute and chronic graft-versus-host diseases (GVHD)
were graded according to the established criteria [9].
3. Analysis of chimerism
Whole blood samples were collected from individual do-
nors and recipients at 1 (day 28), 2, 3, 6, and 12 months
after allo-HSCT. In cases where MC was detected, chimerism
was tested at more frequent intervals. DNA was prepared
from whole blood samples using the QIAamp Blood Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and quantified spectrophoto-
metrically. Polymorphic short-tandem repeat (STR) markers
were amplified using the AmpFlSTR Profiled Plus PCR am-
plification kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Amplified fragments were analyzed using an ABI PRISM
310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), and peak areas
were quantified using Genescan software (Applied Biosys-
tems). The percentages of donor and recipient DNA were
calculated from individual proportions of donor and recipient
peak areas [10]. Unless otherwise stated, the degrees of
STR-PCR and MC were based on host portions.
4. Definition of chimerism and responses
Patients were stratified individually based on serial
STR-PCR analyses, with chimerism defined as described pre-
viously [7, 8]. Patients with samples showing 1% or less
autologous signals after HSCT were classified as having ach-
ieved complete donor chimerism (CC). We selected a cutoff
of 1%, since microsatellite and several tandem repeat meth-
ods have a sensitivity limit of 1-5%. MC was defined as
having a recipient fraction of 1% to 99% at any time after
HSCT. Patients initially classified as having MC who turned
into CC were classified in the transient MC group, while
those showing sustained autologous signals greater than 1%

were categorized in the sustained MC group. In the sustained
MC group, patients consistently displaying autologous signals
that did not exceed 30% were considered to have low-level
MC, while those displaying a significant increase in autolo-
gous cells, up to 30%, were considered to have high-level
MC. Patients with more than 99% recipient signals were
defined as having attained complete recipient chimerism
(RC) or autologous reconstitution.
Since there is no clear consensus on the definition of
clinical remission in patients with non-malignant diseases,
we assessed the response relative to correction of the under-
lying disease using disease-specific measures. These included
normal hemograms along with transfusion independence in
patients with BMF syndromes, immune reconstitution and
lack of infection in patients with immunodeficiencies, en-
zyme concentrations and the results of brain imaging and
neurologic examinations in patients with metabolic dis-
orders, and absence of symptoms and discontinuation of
pretransplant-specific therapies in patients with autoimmune
disorders [11]. A complete response (CR) was defined as
a normal hemogram with eradication of the underlying
disease. A partial response (PR) was defined as the presence
of some positive effects of HSCT, but not fulfillment of the
criteria for CR (e.g., patients with BMF that displayed some
improvement, but were still transfusion dependent). Disease
progression was defined as the absence of positive effects
of HSCT.
Graft failure comprises 2 clinical entities: (1) failure to
achieve an absolute neutrophil count of 0.5×109
/L or less
and marrow hypoplasia for less than 60 days with or without
the existence of donor-type hematopoiesis, and (2) complete
loss of donor-type hematopoiesis occurring anytime after
transplantation. Late graft failure was defined as the loss
of the graft after engraftment during follow-up.
5. Statistics
The probabilities of overall survival (OS) and event-free
survival (EFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method. An event was defined as graft failure or death either
due to treatment toxicity or disease progression. Fisher’s
exact test was used to compare differences in categorical
variables affecting chimerism and response to HSCT between
groups, whereas the Mann-Whitney U-test was used to com-
pare continuous variables. We also attempted to model rela-
tionships between 2 continuous variables by linear
regression. For multivariate analysis, the logistic regression
model was used. Rreceiver operating characteristic (ROC)
plot analysis was performed to determine the threshold value
of CD34＋ cells for predicting chimerism. Probabilities of
acute and chronic GVHD were calculated using the cumu-
lative-incidence-function method; death without GVHD was
the competing event. All statistical analyses were performed
using the SPSS statistical program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) or R 2.10.1 software (The R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, 2007). All P-values were 2-sided, with P＜0.05
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Forty-eight patients underwent allo-HSCT, and 2 required
a second transplant due to graft failure after the first HSCT.
At a median follow-up of 41 months, the 3-year OS and
EFS rates were 91.5±4.1% and 85.3±5.1%, respectively. Four
patients died, 1 due to graft failure and the other 3 due
to transplant-related complications, including veno-occlu-
sive disease, hemorrhage, multi-organ failure, and infection.
1. Chimerism
During follow-up, 23 patients (48%) showed sustained
CC and 23 (48%) showed MC. Peak MC in the groups of
patients with transient (N=9), low-level (N=10), and high-
level (N=4) MC occurred at a median of 3, 3.5, and 2.3
months, respectively. Patients with transient MC achieved
CC at a median of 7.7 months after HSCT. All 4 patients
with high-level MC showed more than 30% autologous sig-
nals within 2 months after HSCT. The chimeric status of
patients with high-level MC is shown in Fig. 1.
Two of the 4 patients with high-level MC subsequently
experienced graft failure after HSCT (Table 2). One of these
patients (UPN 88) achieved CR after the second HSCT, but
died due to transplant-related complications resulting in mul-
tiple organ failure after 5 months. The second patient (UPN
127) received 2 donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs), but did
not achieve stable engraftment, and subsequently died due
to infection and pulmonary hemorrhage.
RC was detected on day 28 after HSCT in 2 patients,
1 with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and 1
with SAA. Although the patient with HLH experienced graft
failure, BM showed autologous recovery, and the patient

remained in CR at data cut-off. The SAA patient achieved
neutrophil engraftment on day 11 (10% autologous portion
of MC on day 20), but neutropenia occurred at day 14,
and STR-PCR revealed 100% host signal at day 28. Owing
to graft failure, the patient underwent a second HSCT and
achieved CC with stable engraftment.
2. STR-PCR at day 28 post-HSCT
We observed a linear relationship between the degree
of day-28 STR-PCR and pretransplant ferritin concentra-
tions. Higher ferritin concentrations were significantly asso-
ciated with a higher recipient proportion of MC by day
28 after HSCT (r2
=0.2, P=0.03). At day 28 after HSCT,
STR-PCR values were significantly higher in patients with
high-level MC than those with transient or low-level MC
(50.8% vs. 3.7%, P＜0.01).
We observed a linear relationship between the day-28
STR-PCR and time to engraftment. Specifically, a high pro-
portion of autologous cells at day 28 after HSCT were sig-
nificantly associated with late neutrophil (r2
=0.24, P＜0.01)
and platelet (r2
=0.15, P=0.02) engraftment. No differences
were evident in the day-28 STR-PCR between patients with
PR and CR. However, STR-PCR at day 28 was significantly
lower in the response than the non-response group (6.1%
vs. 66.0%, P＜0.01).
3. Variables affecting chimerism
The variables tested for effects on chimerism included
patient age, disease category, numbers of infused CD34＋
and CD3＋ cells, source of stem cells, donor type, degree
of HLA match, pretransplant serum ferritin concentration,
and intensity of the conditioning regimen. Increasing MC
was only observed in patients with BMF. The number of
infused CD34＋ cells was significantly higher in the CC
group than in the MC group (13.2×106
/kg vs. 7.2×106
/kg,
respectively; P＜0.01). Similarly, we observed a marked in-
crease in the number of infused CD3＋ cells in the CC
group compared to the MC group (4.92×108
/kg vs. 2.61×
108
/kg, respectively; P=0.02). The only variable with a sig-
nificant influence on patients’ chimerism status was the num-
ber of infused CD34＋ cells, as determined by multivariate
analysis. Using ROC curves, the optimal cut-off value of
CD34＋ cells for predicting the chimerism status was esti-
mated to be 8.35×106
/kg (70.6% sensitivity, 69.2% specific-
ity), indicating that patients who received less than 8.35×
106
/kg of CD34＋ cells are at higher risk of developing MC
(Fig. 2).
4. Chimerism and transplantation outcomes
The relationship between chimerism status and clinical
response is shown in Table 3. All patients with CC and
low-level/transient MC showed clinical responses to HSCT.
Among the 23 patients with posttransplant CC, 20 achieved
CR, including 1 who experienced late graft failure 39 months
after HSCT, but achieved CR after immunosuppressive
therapy. The remaining 3 patients achieved PR, 1 each with
adrenoleukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, and SAA. Among the
23 patients with posttransplant MC, 21 showed clinical re-

sponses to HSCT. Two patients with high-level MC experi-
enced graft failure. The incidence of CR in the transient,
low-level, and high-level MC subgroups was 89% (8/9), 80%
(8/10), and 50% (2/4), respectively (P=0.03). The incidence
of graft failure was significantly higher in the high-level
MC subgroup than the low-level and transient MC subgroups
(P=0.03). Higher ferritin concentrations before HSCT (P＜
0.01) and lower numbers of infused CD34＋ cells (P=0.01)
were additionally associated with graft failure.
The incidences of grades II?IV acute and chronic GVHD
were significantly higher in CC patients than in MC patients
(56.5% vs. 13.0%, P＜0.01; and 47.8% vs. 21.7%, P=0.04,
respectively). No significant differences in survival were evi-
dent between the CC and MC groups. However, the OS
rate was significantly lower in patients with high-level MC
than in patients with low-level and transient MC (50.0%
vs. 93.8%, P=0.03; Fig. 3). The EFS rate of patients with
high-level and low-level/transient MC was 87.5% and 50.0%,
respectively (P=0.05; Fig. 4). The causes of death in the
high-level MC group included graft failure and multi-organ
failure after second HSCT.
DISCUSSION
This study presents a retrospective analysis of chimerism
status and the effects of chimerism on clinical outcomes
in children undergoing HSCT for non-malignant diseases.
Allo-HSCT was considered the only curative approach for
non-malignant diseases in our patients. In our cohort of
48 patients receiving 50 allo-HSCTs, 5 showed graft failure.
The overall survival rate was 91.5%, similar to that reported
in earlier studies involving patients with non-malignant dis-
eases [2, 12].
Unlike hematologic malignancies, where 100% donor en-
graftment is always desired, the number of donor cells re-

quired for sustained engraftment and correction of under-
lying disease in patients with non-malignant disorders may
be host- and disease-specific. The incidence of MC in our
study was 48%, similar to that reported previously [13].
Possible factors associated with MC development include
the source of hematopoietic stem cells, intensity of the con-
ditioning regimen, composition of the hematopoietic graft,
and type of donor [14-16]. In our experiments, the only
variable that had a significant influence on the achievement
of MC was the number of infused CD34＋ cells, as determined
by multivariate analysis. Baron et al. [17] suggested that
more rapid reconstitution of the T-cell system and reduced
rejection rates could be achieved by increasing the dose
of CD34＋ cells administered. Similar findings have been
reported in other studies [18, 19].
While no significant differences were evident in transplant
outcomes between patients with MC and those with CC,
acute and chronic GVHD rates were lower in the MC group.
Furthermore, all patients with low-level or transient MC
successfully maintained engraftment and showed clinical re-
sponses to HSCT. The lower incidence of GVHD in the
MC group may be attributed to a decrease in alloreactive
T-cells that attack recipient tissues or an imbalance between
pro-inflammatory and immune-modulating cytokines [20].
STR-PCR at day 28 after allo-HSCT had a predictive value
for transplantation outcomes. The degree of STR-PCR was
significantly lower in responders than nonresponders.
Moreover, day-28 STR-PCR facilitated the identification of
patients at risk of high-level MC. Therefore, the degree of
chimerism at day 28 after allo-HSCT may be used as a novel
platform for additional therapy to induce CR.
High-level MC is correlated with an increased risk of
graft failure and rejection [21]. Although we observed no
significant differences in survival between the CC and MC
groups, we found that patients with high-level MC displayed
a higher rate of graft failure and lower survival than those
with low-level or transient MC. MC is not necessarily asso-
ciated with graft rejection, but patients with more than 30%
recipient cells in serial samples may be at a higher risk
of graft failure. However, no graft loss was observed in 50%
of patients with increasing MC. Thus, the risk of graft re-
jection after allo-HSCT may be limited to the period before
the development of tolerance, suggesting that chimerism
testing is not predictive of rejection once tolerance to donor
cells has been established. Our understanding of tolerance
development following allo-HSCT for non-malignant dis-
eases is still incomplete.
In patients undergoing allo-HSCT with either myeloa-
blative conditioning or reduced intensity conditioning for
hematologic malignancies, elevated pretransplant serum fer-
ritin concentration, a surrogate marker of iron overload,
has been associated with lower OS and increased nonrelapse
mortality [22-24]. We observed an association of pretrans-
plant ferritin concentration with day-28 STR-PCR, but not
chimerism status thereafter, during the first year after HSCT.
Patients experiencing graft failure displayed extremely high
ferritin concentrations. Iron overload is known to be asso-
ciated with free radical generation and tissue damage [23].
Overloaded iron may have accumulated in the BM, resulting
in deterioration of microenvironmental functions. However,
the number of patients with graft failure was relatively small,
suggesting the need for larger-scale studies.
Our study had some limitations. First, the retrospective
study design, small sample size, and heterogeneous diseases,
and transplantation procedures may have precluded mean-
ingful analyses. Nevertheless, this was a relatively large-scale
investigation of this rare disease state in children, managed
uniformly in a single center. Next, we did not evaluate line-
age-specific chimerism in individual patients. Finally, since
treatment was based on individual clinical situations, we
did not analyze what interventions may have been prompted
by the results of chimerism assays, thus affecting patients’
clinical outcomes.
In summary, our findings suggest that posttransplant MC
in non-malignant diseases indicates a tolerant state associated
with decreased incidence of acute and chronic GVHD. MC
may thus be sufficient to cure non-malignant disease.
However, patients subsequently presenting with more than
30% recipient cells in serial samples may be at a higher
risk of graft failure. The degree of chimerism at day 28
after HSCT may allow the prediction of subsequent clinical
responses to HSCT. Our findings collectively highlight the
potential value of serial chimerism assays combined with
clinical evaluation in providing information on trans-
plantation outcomes.
