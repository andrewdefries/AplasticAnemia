ABSTRACT
DNA repair maintains genomic stability and the loss
of DNA repair capacity results in genetic instability
that may lead to a decline of cellular function. Adult
stem cells are extremely important in the long-term
maintenance of tissues throughout life. They regen-
erate and renew tissues in response to damage
and replace senescent terminally differentiated
cells that no longer function. Oxidative stress,
toxic byproducts, reduced mitochondrial function
and external exposures all damage DNA through
base modification or mis-incorporation and result in
DNA damage. As in most cells, this damage may
limit the survival of the stem cell population affect-
ing tissue regeneration and even longevity. This
review examines the hypothesis that an age-related
loss of DNA damage repair pathways poses a
significant threat to stem cell survival and longevity.
Normal stem cells appear to have strict control of
gene expression and DNA replication whereas stem
cells with loss of DNA repair may have altered
patterns of proliferation, quiescence and differentia-
tion. Furthermore, stem cells with loss of DNA repair
may be susceptible to malignant transformation
either directly or through the emergence of cancer-
prone stem cells. Human diseases and animal
models of loss of DNA repair provide longitudinal
analysis of DNA repair processes in stem cell
populations and may provide links to the physiology
of aging.
STEM CELL FUNCTION
In adult tissues, cells maintain a delicate balance between
proliferation and apoptosis. Stem cells are important
mediators of tissue maintenance and wound repair. Their
longevity is dependent on careful control of gene
expression, proliferation and cell cycle, and diﬀerentiation
signals. Of note, a number of human genetic abnormalities
associated with aging, and those replicated in the mouse,
suggest that loss of DNA repair may contribute to the
aging process. This review will provide support for the
argument that maintenance of the adult stem cell genome
through robust DNA repair is fundamental in the
prevention of aging and disease; furthermore, that failure
of genomic maintenance is a leading cause of cancer,
as well as senescence.
Adult stem cells are located in a variety of locations
throughout the body and provide support for a variety
of tissue functions (Figure 1). Chief among these are
the function of providing undiﬀerentiated cells for the
rejuvenation of tissue. In this regard, most adult stem cells
function in a tissue-restricted fashion; hematopoietic stem
cells (HSC) that reside in the bone marrow have long been
known to mediate the production of both lymphoid and
myeloid cell lineages. High-dose radiation and chemother-
apy are used to ablate these cells as well as hematologic
malignancies; however, single stem-cell clones either
normal or cancerous in origin, are capable of repopulation
(1–4). As humans age, the HSC as well as all adult stem
cells must maintain a delicate balance between prolifera-
tion and tissue maintenance, senescence and oncogenesis
(Figure 2). With age, disease and in humans who have
a genetic loss of DNA repair capacity, recovery of
hematopoietic progenitor and stem cell populations from
the marrow of humans, characterized by the CD34
antigen, decrease as a function of age, while not directly
measured, these data suggest that there is a decrease in the
capacity for multi-lineage hematopoietic reconstitution
with age (5,6). One example of this is the increasing
incidence of various types of anemia and hematologic as
well as most other malignancies that occurs in humans
with age (7–9). Neural stem cells (NSC) reside within the
olfactory lobe, spinal cord and sub-ventricular zone of the
brain. These cells then migrate and diﬀerentiate to sites
of damage to potentially mediate repair. Abnormalities
of this function may enable the NSC pool to transform
and give rise to neural cancers speciﬁcally glioblastomas,
medulloblastomas and ependymomas, whereas NSC

failure has been implicated in neural degenerative diseases
(10,11). Adult stem cells can also be isolated from the skin,
liver, gut, glandular tissue, vasculature and even muscle.
Evidence suggests that there are undiﬀerentiated adult
cells capable of tissue repair in many organs (9,12,13). As
noted below, defects in DNA repair aﬀect these organs as
well. The global process of aging may in fact be linked
to a global decline in tissue stem cell function and this in
turn may be linked to changes in DNA damage repair
processes.
STEM CELL FAILURE ASSOCIATED WITH LOSS
OF DNA REPAIR AND AGING
Double strand break (DSB)repair and stem cell failure
HSC deﬁciency in the DSB non-homologous end-joining
(NHEJ) pathway has been observed in mouse models
(14,15). NHEJ repairs exogenous DSBs, such as after
radiation exposure or endogenous breaks such as during
VDJ recombination. The complex of proteins and
enzymes involved includes DNA-PK, Ku70 and Ku80,
which form a complex at the break, aligning short
homologies in overhand regions, and the Ligase IV/
XRCC4 complex that seals the break. Nijnik et al. (15)
described a mouse with hypomorphic mutations within
ligase IV, LigIV, resulting in the Lig4y288c
mouse. This
mouse is characterized by growth retardation, immuno-
deﬁciency and pancytopenia. These mice develop a
progressive, age-dependent defect in hematopoiesis. By
20–26 weeks, they have reduced multipotent hematopoie-
tic progenitors, deﬁned as c-Kit+
, lineage –, c-SCA+
(KLS) cells, reduced total bone marrow cell count and
erythroid cell count by ﬂow cytometry. This seems to hint
at reduced stem cell maintenance resulting from the
loss of Ligase IV. When Lig4y288c
donor stem cells were
subject to competitive repopulation of lethally irradiated
recipient mice that were infused with equal numbers of
normal marrow cells and Lig4y288c
donor marrow cells,
a repopulation defect was observed. Flow cytometric
analysis revealed that 8 weeks post transplant, Lig4y288c
KLS donor cells have reduced contribution to all compo-
nents of hematopoiesis, including whole bone marrow cell
counts, pro-B-cell and granulocyte lineages. Thus this data
conﬁrms that defects in DNA DSB repair inﬂuence stem
cell hematopoietic reconstitution function. However, the
precise role that DSBs play during hematopoiesis and why
repair of these breaks is so crucial to stem cell survival has
not been elucidated.
In related work by Rossi et al. (14) Ku80À/À
mice, also
defective in NHEJ, were examined for stem cell defects.
They found that these mice are signiﬁcantly retarded in
macrophage and granulocyte reconstitution after trans-
plantation. In addition, after competitive repopulation
with wild-type marrow cells, the Ku80À/À
donor derived
HSC reconstituted poorly and were lost over time (14).
Recent data from our laboratory also implicate a role
for Ku70 in hematopoiesis. Multilineage hematopoietic
failure is seen in Ku70À
/À
mice leading to severe immuno-
deﬁciency of both T and B cells and poor hematopoietic
reconstitution after transplantation (16). These cells also
have a competitive repopulation defect compared to wild-
type marrow cells. Together, these mouse models provide
evidence that NHEJ deﬁciencies result in reduced HSC
activity, deﬁned by reduced capacity for hematopoietic
reconstitution and failure to compete against normal
reconstituting stem cells after transplantation. In these
mice, the hematopoietic defect is exacerbated with age.
Whether a qualitative loss of NHEJ contributes to accu-
mulated abnormalities of normal hematopoietic capacity
with age has not been evaluated.
Of note, NHEJ proteins are also involved in VDJ
recombination, a process in T and B cells of generating
diversity in the T-cell receptor and B-cell heavy chain loci.
During this process, initiated by Rag1 and Rag2, a strand
break at the VDJ loci is initiated, followed by formation
of a hairpin recognized by DNA-PK and Ku70/80 and
closed by Ligase IV. In the process, and to increase genetic
diversity, terminal deoxytransferase ﬁlls in the overhang,
creating mismatches in the double strand that are
then repaired by the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway
(17,18). Given the activity of VDJ recombination in early
lymphoid progenitors, it is possible that in the absence of
well-regulated NHEJ, a similar process is ongoing in more
primitive HSC populations.
Another component of the DSBs repair response,
telomere maintenance and DNA replication is the
MRE11, Rad50 and NBS1 (MRN) complex. This complex

is also a factor in hematopoietic maintenance. The MRN
complex participates in repair of DSB by sensing and
unwinding the region of the break. The complex also
participates in DNA-strand break scaﬀold formation and
signaling of the repair response, including ATM (see
below). MRN complex partner null mutants are not
viable (19–22), and Bender et al. (23) identiﬁed that a
hypomorphic Rad50k22m
mutation in mice results in partial
embryonic lethality. At birth, Rad50k22m
mice are under-
weight compared to wild type and had an average survival
of about 2.5 months. In 20% cases the cause of death was a
B-cell lymphoma with splenic hyperplasia. The death of the
other 80% of Rad50k22m
mice could be attributed to sever
anemia, a form of hematopoietic failure. HSC were present
at 2 weeks, however, complete ablation of bone marrow
HSC was observed by 4–8 weeks. The authors observed
that the HSC ablation was mirrored by loss of macrophage,
T cell and pro- and pre- B cells when compared to wild type
at Week 4. Co-transplant experiments involving mixing
wild-type and Rad50k22m
mutant marrow cells in a 1:1 ratio
and transplantation into a normal but lethally irradiated
host, failed to demonstrate any Rad50k22m
mutant HSC
survival. Rather, all recipient cells detected were derived
from the wild-type donor cells.
This indicates that there is a stem cell defect caused by
the reduced function of Rad50 either alone, or implicating
the entire MRN complex. It appears that the MRN
complex, by mediating DNA strand break repair, main-
tains stem cell function (23).
A partial rescue of the Rad50k22m
phenotype occurs
with loss of p53 function, indicating that cell cycle and
apoptotic signaling from the unrepaired DSB through p53
results in stem cell death so that loss of function allows
stem cell survival. The p53–/–
Rad50k22m
mice did not have
severe anemia or HSC ablation, and had an extended
lifespan. However, the stem cell pool is not normal
because these animals died of lymphoma suggesting that
loss of genomic stability contributed to malignant
transformation (23). This evidence illustrates the impor-
tance of DNA damage repair to the self-renewal capacity
of the HSC and indicates that stem cell death is mediated
by p53-dependent apoptotic signaling.
These results raise the question of whether there is
evidence that DNA repair capacity decreases with age and
if so under what circumstances. This has been studied in
mice. Goodell et al. (24) evaluated a number of genes in
mouse kit+sca+lin- (KLS) HSC isolated from aged
mice, 21–28 months of age or young mice aged 2, 8 or 12
months. While a number of stress response, protein
folding and inﬂammatory genes were upregulated, these
authors also identiﬁed a number of DNA repair associated
genes that were downregulated. Although these results
were not associated with a phenotype in the mice
analyzed, they do suggest that there is a trend toward, if
not a substantial reduction in, DNA repair capacity
associated with aging in mice. The speciﬁc genes noted to
be reduced in expression with age include Xab2 [XPA-
binding protein 2, involved in the nucleotide excision
repair (NER) pathway], Rad52 (a ssDNA-binding protein
involved in homologous recombination) (25), XRCC1
[involved in coordination of single-strand break repair and
base excision repair (BER) pathways] (26) and Blm (a req
helicase involved in DSB repair) (27). It is feasible that
reduced expression of these genes could disrupt DNA
repair performance and lead to genomic instability. Since
this is likely to occur in single somatic cells, the immediate
impact on a stem or progenitor cell population would be
diﬃcult to assess. However, over time, these changes may
cumulatively lead to decreased stem cell function with age.
There are data in human HSC from Prall et al. (28) that
these stem cells acquire NHEJ repair deﬁciency with age.
Using immuno-magnetic separation to isolate CD34+ cell
fractions of human umbilical cord bloods and bone
marrow samples from donors ranging in age from 18 to
101 years, HSC were obtained. cDNA from these samples
was then synthesized and ampliﬁed on arrays. The
resulting gene cluster analysis revealed a number of
genes that were up- or downregulated. Ku70, the
heterodimeric partner of Ku80, was shown to be down-
regulated. Further BIK or BCL2-interacting killer protein
was upregulated in HSC from older individuals. The
authors postulate that BIK and Ku70 have roles in the
apoptotic response. Ku70 interacts with a promoter
of apoptosis, Bax, while BIK (29) interacts with the anti-
apoptotic protein Blc2. Thus, reduced Ku70 expression
leads to reduced NHEJ repair eﬃciency as well as priming
the apoptosis signaling pathway in stem cells of elderly
individuals.
In DNA ligase 1 (Lig1) knockout mice (30), several
phenotypic characteristics also indicate a role for this
enzyme in stem cell maintenance. Lig1(À/À)
is an embryo-
nic lethal, with abnormalities observed after embryonic
Day 10.5 due to increasingly anemic and death by E 15.5
(30) due to a failure to develop fetal liver erythropoiesis.
Fetal liver cells from the Lig(À/À)
embryos were unable to
repopulate lethally irradiated recipients, resulting in bone
marrow failure by 10 weeks. Surviving mice exhibited
anemia, enlarged erythrocytes and reticulocytosis (30).
This indicates the reliance of HSC on proﬁcient and
reliable genomic replication and maintenance to function,
even without overt external DNA damage.
These various lines of evidence exhibit a delicate
balance between DNA replication and repair in cell prolif-
eration, self-renewal and quiescence in stem cell main-
tenance. While DNA repair is essential for stem cell
maintenance, there appears to be a decline in DNA repair
function with age. While not proven, we propose that this
sets the stage for a programmed loss of stem cell capacity
with age. Adult stem cells must serve as long-term
reservoirs of undiﬀerentiated tissue that can be called
upon to repair, and yet they prime themselves to undergo
apoptosis as they age. These results also indicate a
relationship between long-term stem cell survival and
cancer. For instance, one response to limited cell pool
and a decline in function is selection of surviving stem
cells for properties of increased proliferation and resis-
tance to apoptosis, two requisites for malignant transfor-
mation. This is facilitated by emergence of genomic
instability in the face of decreased DNA repair capacity.
Alternatively, these defects in stem cells may lead to adult
stem cell failure syndromes, either aplastic anemia,

osteoporosis or myelodysplastic syndrome, a defect in
hematopoiesis.
MMR DEFECTS IN STEM CELLS AND CANCER
STEM CELLS
A number of malignancies occur in the setting of genomic
instability and these tumors may be linked to DNA repair
defects at the level of the tissue stem cell. Hereditary non-
polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) was discovered
in patients who had functional heterozygous mutations
in a gene for MMR. Receiving a second hit in the single
functional copy due to gene deletion, promoter hyper-
methylation or other epigenetic events leads to the
formation of a hypermutator phenotype in the intestinal
stem cell. This hypermutator adult stem cell exhibits
increased rates of mutation at microsatellite loci, described
as microsatellite instability (MSI) (31). One of the results
of high levels of MSI in the intestinal stem cell is
the resulting mutation of a particular microsatellite
loci located within the TNF-b receptor gene, which results
in a nonfunctional truncated TNF-b receptor. Haploin-
suﬃciency then reduces TNF-b anti-tumor signaling and
leads to the formation of aberrant crypt foci, and later
cancer (32,33). Thus, the consequences of loss of MMR
are progressive over time and with age.
It appears that similar processes occur with loss of
MMR in HSC. In mice with a knockout of many of the
MMR genes—Pms2, Msh2 and Mlh1, lymphomagenesis
is observed. MMR also plays a broad role in the survival
and function of the HSC. Using Msh2À/À
mice by our
laboratory, Reese et al. 2003 (34) found that HSC from
mice lacking MMR were defective in hematopoiesis.
Serial-transplant experiments revealed that these MMR-
defective HSC possess a severe repopulation defect
characterized by loss of HSC in recipient mice, decrease
in hematopoiesis and inability to rescue tertiary transplant
mice that received lethal irradiation prior to cell
infusion. Rather, these mice die of stem cell failure.
In hematopoietic competitive reconstitution experiments,
co-transplanting HSC mixtures of wild-type and Msh2À/À
marrow cells in a 1:1 ratio results in loss of the Msh2
knockout HSC in the recipient, indicating a severe
repopulation defect. Progenitor colony-forming cells
from the Msh2 marrow recipient mice also showed
evidence of MSI in the Msh2À
/À
cells. This occurs as a
function of age, since no evidence of microsatellites is seen
in young Msh2À
/À
mice.
In humans, acquired defects in MMR have been
observed in both childhood and adult leukemias and
lymphomas. While a family with a germline defect in
MLH1 is predisposed to leukemias (35) and neuroﬁbro-
matosis (36,37), sporadic leukemias and lymphomas (38)
are also associated with MSI and with defects in MMR.
Human leukemia cell lines also show evidence of loss of
MMR protein expression (39). Secondary leukemias,
those induced in patients previously receiving chemother-
apy also have a high incidence of MSI, suggesting both
selection in favor of leukemic clones from the stem cell
population, and possibly the impact of drug selection of
MMR-defective drug-resistant cells (40–42). Cumula-
tively, these data suggest that maintenance of genomic
stability retains stem cells in their normal physiologic
composition whereas the presence of MMR defects allows
expansion of stem cell clones with acquired mutations
leading to malignant transformation (43). Given the fact
that families with HNPCC also are at risk for ovarian
cancers—Geisler et al. (44) report 16.8% of ovarian tumor
samples tested showed high-frequency MSI—and that
other patients with ovarian cancer demonstrate MSI, and
have no expression at the mRNA level of hMLH1, due to
promoter hypermethylation, the overall impact of MMR
on maintenance of stem cells from multiple organs and
their tendency towards malignant transformation is
relatively clear. Thus, there is evidence that MMR is
important in HSC preservation, human carcinogenesis,
and perhaps with the overall aging process of multiple
tissues and their respective stem cells.
STEM CELL DEFECTS DUE TO LOSS OF
INTERSTRAND DNA CROSS-LINK REPAIR
Fanconi’s anemia (FA) is characterized by early onset
aplastic anemia due to HSC exhaustion, increased
incidence of cancer—particularly AML—as well as
heterogeneous birth defects. The hematologic defects
include pancytopenia, low marrow reserve, poor cytokine
responsiveness, increased apoptosis of hematopoietic
progenitors and poor stem cell transplantation capabilities
(45). The molecular phenotypes of FA are hypersensitivity
to DNA cross-linking agents, mild sensitivity to ionizing
radiation and reactive oxygen species, chromosomal
instability, growth arrest, apoptosis and G2/M phase
delay (45–48). Patients with FA are also hypersensitive to
cancer therapies that cause DNA damage. Thus, DNA
repair function appears to link the phenotypes of both
cancer and cancer stem cells when repair function is
disrupted and maintenance of normal stem cells when
DNA repair is intact.
Early descriptions of FA found that cell lines from FA
patients could be divided into 12 complementation groups
and later, 11 gene mutations. These have now been
clariﬁed as FANC[A–C, D1(BRCA2),D2-F,G, BRIP1, J,
L, M] (48). Additionally, a 13th complementation group
has been reported to be associated with mutations in
the partner and localizer of BRCA2, or PALB2 (49,50).
Five of the FA proteins (FANCA, C, E, F and G) form a
nuclear complex that monoubiquinate FANCD2. One
protein is a ubiquitin ligase (FANCL), one has helicase
function, (FANCJ) and one is homologous with the breast
cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 (48). While still not
fully characterized, these proteins bind to other complexes
involved in DSB repair and at DNA replication forks (51)
and in this way appear to mediate these processes.
While the FA protein complex includes BRCA 1 and 2,
the FA protein complex is not the primary functional
group for either DSB repair or homologous recombina-
tion. Conversely, hematopoietic defects are not recognized
in carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2. It is clear that indivi-
duals possessing a single mutated copy of the BRCA2
7560 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 22
gene have an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer
(52). However, possessing two mutated copies of BRCA2
results in the HSC exhaustion associated with FA.
Loss of function leads to chromosomal translocations,
rearrangements and deletions. Disruptions of the FANC
pathway alter the response to DSB in DNA. Thus it is
possible that complete loss of FA-associated gene
products results in adult stem cell failure due to senescence
and apoptosis; however, single allele mutations in the FA
core complex and associated proteins lead to a require-
ment for a second hit to initiate a mutator phenotype in
adult stem cells that potentially escape cell cycle and
apoptotic controls, leading to immortalization, transfor-
mation and carcinogenesis (48).
STEM CELL DEFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH
ABNORMALITIES IN NER
Premature aging diseases are rare and multivariate in
cause; however, many seem to be related in some way to
abnormalities in genomic maintenance. Many of these
diseases also have evidence of defects in stem cell
maintenance. Table 1 depicts a number of the recognized
premature aging diseases, phenotypes and corresponding
genetic mutations in DNA damage repair and response
genes, particularly NER genes.
The NER pathway removes DNA lesions caused by a
wide variety of chemical alterations of the DNA bases
including pyrimidine dimers produced by exposure to UV
radiation. NER functions in two major pathways, the
global genome NER pathway (GG-NER) and the
transcription coupled NER pathway (TC-NER). As its
name implies, GG-NER is involved in the global
surveillance and repair of the genome, while TC-NER
repairs lesions that block elongation of transcription
complexes.
Ten gene products of the NER pathway have been
associated with human disease—these are XPA-G, named
for their association with Xeroderma Pigmentosa (XP),
CSA, CSB and ERCC-1 (53,54). XP, Cockayne Syndrome
(CS) and Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) diseases are char-
acterized by solar hypersensitivity and all share mutations
in the NER pathway. TTD patients have also been
observed with mutations in or lowered expression of
TFIIH a general transcription factor complex with heli-
case activity that is required for transcriptional elongation
as well as NER but also mutations in XPD and XPB
(55,56). This illustrates very clearly the multifunctional
nature of NER gene products. Those mutations that lead
to XP are related to GG-NER and more speciﬁcally the
XP proteins that function to recognize and bind DNA
lesions and participate in apoptotic signaling. CS and
TTD patients have mutations in NER genes associated
with TC-NER and retain apoptotic signaling as well as
DNA lesion recognition but lack the ability to rapidly
restore stalled transcription due to base alterations. Thus,
the CS or TTD mutant cell is unable to restore
transcription during important transcriptionally regulated
developmental signaling. On the other hand, increased
rates of apoptosis due to DNA lesion accumulation and
recognition, could account for neural degenerative
phenotypes as well as the segmental progeroid phenotype
due to tissue-speciﬁc stem cell failure (53).
The stem cell defect of these conditions is best
characterized in mouse knockout models. First, mouse
models of TTD, in which the Xpd helicase is mutated,
show striking similarities to the human disease (14,57).
In addition, hematopoietic marrow transplant studies
using competitive transplantation with 26 week wt or Xpd
helicase mutant mice show that Xpd mutant donor cells
have a signiﬁcant repopulation defect compared to wild-
type cells with reductions in whole-bone marrow engraft-
ment of B cell, T cell, myeloid and granulocytes (14). In
Ercc1À/À
mice, a premature aging phenotype is observed
by 3 weeks of age that is associated with hematopoietic
failure (58). Normal Ercc1 forms a heterodimer with XPF
to crease an endonuclease that functions in NER and
interstrand cross-link repair. These mice have a progres-
sive peripheral blood cytopenia, marrow fatty inﬁltrate,
progressive reduced bone marrow cellularity, decreased
progenitor potential and decreased lymphoid lineage
commitment (58). In humans, the phenotype of stem cell
failure is subtler, with an increased risk of leukemogenesis
but only minimal evidence of hematopoietic failure.
Thus, loss of NHEJ, MMR, DSB repair and NER in
mice are all associated with progressive severe hemato-
poietic repopulation defects, many have a primary
engraftment defect, with loss of stem cell pools, and
many are also associated with a tendency to develop
genomic instability among stem cell pools giving rise to
carcinogenesis. In each case, the defects manifest them-
selves with progressive loss of hematopoietic function over
time, suggesting that age contributes to the severity of
hematopoietic failure. Whether acquired defects in these
pathways contribute to loss of hematopoietic function
during the normal aging process is not yet clear.

recognition that aging might be associated with loss of
telomere length leading to senescence, hematopoiesis in
telomere knockout mice is surprisingly normal. However,
examining late generation telomerase-deﬁcient mice
[mTerc(À/À
)], hematopoietic reserve is indeed limited and
is accompanied by short telomeres in the progenitor
population (59). This is pronounced under forced stem cell
proliferation either in repopulation assays as described
above or in short term proliferation assays of hemato-
poietic progenitors—the colony forming unit (CFU)—
granulocyte-macrophage or CFU-spleen (CFU-S). In
serial repopulation transplantation experiments, stem cell
failure is seen (59) and p21 is activated, leading to
checkpoint activation and cell cycle arrest. This can be
partially rescued by loss of p21 (Cdkn1a, Cip1/Waf)
because DNA strand break sensing which occurs in cells
with short telomeres does not occur, limiting the apoptotic
signaling and cell cycle arrest that normally occurs as a
consequence of telomere shortening in proliferating cells
(60). Not only is hematopoiesis restored, but also marrow
cells retain multilineage repopulation capacity.
DISORDERS OF HELICASE FUNCTION AND
STEM CELL DEFECTS
An essential feature of homologous recombination is the
role of RECQ family helicases. Abnormalities of three
genes are associated with premature aging: Werner (WS),
Rothmund–Thomson (RTS) and Bloom (BL) syndromes
(61,62), caused by mutations in the WRN, RECQ4 and
BLM genes, respectively. Each of these syndromes shares
some common traits and yet is characterized by distinct
pathologies. To understand the diﬀerences between these
diseases, a more complete picture of the functional overlap
and speciﬁcities of these gene products must be formed.
All ﬁve of the RECQ family of gene products are 30
–50
DNA helicases; and all are associated with resolution of
DNA DSB. Furthermore, each of those associated with
human disease have unique as well as overlapping
functions (62).
WS is characterized by several premature aging
phenotypes, which occur by the end of the third decade
of life. These include diabetes, increased cancer incidence,
gray hair, as well as myocardial and cerebral vascular
diseases (61,62). The pathologies associated with RTS are
primarily skin disorders; including pigment and hair
follicle growth, osteosarcoma and skeletal defects (63).
Bloom patients suﬀer from dwarﬁsm, hair and nail
malformations and an elevated risk of malignancies and
rare tumors that is especially increased in hematologic
malignancies (27,63). These distinct relationships with the
various RECQ genes and tissue-speciﬁc pathology seem to
distinguish speciﬁc roles for the various RECQ enzymes in
development and genomic surveillance.
WRN has been associated with telomere maintenance
in mouse models (64). A mouse double knockout model
of Wrn and TerC, results in successive shortening of
the telomeres (65,66) and subsequent failure to protect
chromosome ends from being recognized and ‘repaired’ as
DSB, giving rise to premature aging, stem cell and marrow
failure and shortened lifespan.
BLM seems to have a more global genomic surveillance
role. Normal BLM has also been shown to interact with
TOPIIIa (67) suggesting that this interaction plays a role
in Holliday junction resolution and suppression of
aberrant recombination (27,68). The association of BLM
mutation with nearly 100-fold greater incidence of nearly
all forms of cancer as well as numerous chromosomal
abnormalities supports this statement. While these cells
have abnormalities in sister chromatid exchange and
chromosomal rearrangements and translocations, actual
HSC defects, if present, are more subtle.
Mutations of RECQ4 associated with RTS on the other
hand are less well studied. In fact, $33% of RTS cases
lack a recognized RECQ4 mutation (69). A mouse model
however conﬁrms that RecQ4 disruption causes at least
similar pathology as that seen in RTS (70) but no obvious
HSC or other stem cell defect. Thus, despite the
importance of helicases in maintaining hematopoiesis is
in humans, mouse models have not conﬁrmed a linkage
between these processes.
STEM CELL DEFECTS ACCOMPANYING LOSS
OF DSB SENSING PROTEINS
Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT) is a disease associated with
premature aging, particularly of the skin, progressive loss
of cerebellar architecture and neuromotor dysfunction,
immunodeﬁciency including thymic involution, low T-cell
numbers, recurrent respiratory infections, low antibody
production as well as increased incidence of lymphoma
and leukemia and acquisition of chromosomal abnormal-
ities of the skin and hematopoietic system. AT patients
are sensitive to ionizing radiation and DSB-inducing
compounds. AT is caused by a mutation in phosphatidy-
linositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like protein kinase, ATM (71,72)
which senses DNA damage and induces Chk2, a cell cycle
checkpoint protein, phosphorylation and cell cycle arrest.
Following DSBs, ATM and ATM-related PI3Ks (ATR)
signal the presence of DSBs and initiate DSB repair and
cell cycle control through a series of protein phosphoryla-
tion events (73). ATM undergoes auto-phosphorylation
and activates mediators of the DSB pathway including
H2AX, Nbs1 and MRE11. These then localize to a DSB
forming a complex and recruiting the necessary repair
proteins, such as DNA-PK and the Ku70/80 heterodimer
for NHEJ or Rad51 for homologous recombination.
Furthermore, ATM activates checkpoint proteins to
control the cell cycle during repair, including both Chk2
and the mediator of DNA damage checkpoint (MDC1).
Upon its activation, MDC1 seems to be involved in
further Chk2 signaling activation (73). Thus, ATM sits at
the cross roads of DSB repair and cell signaling. This tight
relationship between cell cycle control and DSB repair
seems to be the cause of developmental abnormalities and
accelerated aging observed in AT patients.
In ATM knockout mice, aging is associated with a
progressive loss of lymphoid function, both B- and T-cell
loss and a fundamental defect in HSC function, with
7562 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, No. 22
decreased stem cell numbers, loss of repopulation capacity
and increased apoptosis (74). Clear loss of hematopoietic
activity is age-dependent, apparent by 24 weeks of age,
and the mice have an increased incidence of T-cell
lymphomas. The mice are unable to adequately mount a
DNA repair response in the face of reactive oxygen
species, initiating the caspase apoptotic cascade (74). Ito
et al. (74) found that reactive oxygen species are critical to
maintenance of hematopoiesis since treatment with anti-
oxidants reduced the oxidative stress and maintained stem
cell function in ATMÀ/À
mice.
The ATM HSC defect can also be ameliorated by loss
of other cell cycle check point genes including the proteins
of the DSB recognition complex, mre11/Rad50/Nbs1.
As noted above, the Rad50 hypomorph has evidence of
severe hematopoietic deﬁciency ameliorated by p53 (23).
In regards to rescue of the hematopoietic defect of ATM,
double knockout of ATM and Rad50 results in better
HSC survival (75). Since increased reactive oxygen species
and increased reactive oxidative stress accompanies aging,
these pathways may be critical for stem cell maintenance.
How these processes impact physiologic aging and
contribute to a decline in hematopoietic function are not
yet well deﬁned.
Other Causes of Stem Cell Failure
Aplastic anemia can arise following viral infection,
immune reaction, drug associated toxicity and over-
whelming DNA damage. Parvovirus B19 (76), inﬂuenza
virus (77) and CMV (78) can directly infect HSC inducing
stem cell loss or infect stromal elements that alter the viral
response and impede hematopoiesis. Other viral processes
including EBV (79) and HIV often with coinfection with
Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (80) are associated
with infection of other cells within the stroma that alter
hematopoietic signaling and induce immune responses
that can directly target HSC leading to stem cell failure.
Hepatitis C infection can give rise to a severe immune
mediated aplastic anemia (81). In some instances, either
aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome appears to
occur as part of an immune response, either as primary or
secondary events. Is has been proposed that abnormal
stem cells present altered surface peptides that induce a
T-cell-mediated immune response (82–84) or that drugs
bind to the surface of these cells eliciting a similar T-cell
response, leading to cell-mediated stem cell death. Finally,
for over 60 years we have recognized that agents and
exposures that cause DNA damage to the stem cell
genome induces stem cell failure such as high-dose
radiation and chemotherapy.
Dna Repair During Aging, Stem Cell Survival and
Carcinogenesis
Stem cells continually renew and rejuvenate tissues as
these tissues age and become injured. Reactive oxygen
species from mitochondria, exposure to solar and other
forms of radiation, chemical exposures and extensive
rounds of replication can damage the genome and for
long-lived cells require authentic repair to insure that there
is ﬁdelity in stem cell progeny. Since stem cell survival
through maintenance of pools and self-renewal are
essential for tissue homeostasis, it can be inferred that
DNA repair and genome maintenance may be key factors
in stem cell maintenance and survival of the organism.
If adult stem cells respond to damage with increasing
apoptotic signaling, an organism faces stem cell ablation,
and without further tissue rejuvenation, senescent death.
On the other hand, if an adult stem cell fails to recognize
and repair DNA damage and fails to signal apoptosis,
then damaged adult stem cells will incur mutations over
time, eventually leading to either stem cell loss due to
altered gene expression and loss of stem cell phenotypic
properties or loss of stem cell homeostasis and
carcinogenesis.
SUMMARY
A number of diseases of DNA repair are associated with
premature aging, stem cell failure and carcinogenesis.
Animal knockout models of these processes similarly
show evidence of premature aging, loss of competitive
hematopoiesis, stem cell failure and carcinogenesis.
Recent data suggests that age dependent and acquired
loss of DNA repair may contribute to physiologic aging
and could contribute to the increase in cancer incidence
with age.
Whether these acquired defects are programmed,
subject to genetic polymorphisms or due to environmental
factors remains to be determined. Likewise, interventions
into this decline in DNA repair function may improve
stem cell function and reserve, delay aging and reduce the
incidence of stem cell failure, leukemia and lymphomas.
