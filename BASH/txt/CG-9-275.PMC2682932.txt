Abstract: Biallelic mutations in the NBS1 gene are responsible for the Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), a rare auto-
somal recessive disorder characterized by chromosome instability and hypersensitivity to ionising radiation (IR). Epide-
miological data evidence that the NBS1 gene can be considered a susceptibility factor for cancer development, as demon-
strated by the fact that almost 40% of NBS patients have developed a malignancy before the age of 21. Interestingly, also
NBS1 heterozygotes, which are clinically asymptomatic, display an elevated risk to develop some types of malignant tu-
mours, especially breast, prostate and colorectal cancers, lymphoblastic leukaemia, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL).
So far, nine mutations in the NBS1 gene have been found, at the heterozygous state, in cancer patients. Among them, the
657del5, the I171V and the R215W mutations are the most frequently described. The pathogenicity of these mutations is
presumably connected with their occurrence in the highly conserved BRCT tandem domains of the NBS1 protein, which
are present in a large superfamily of proteins, and are recognized as major mediators of processes related to cell-cycle
checkpoint and DNA repair.
This review will focus on the current state-of-knowledge regarding the correlation between carriers of NBS1 gene muta-
tions and the proneness to the development of malignant tumours.

INTRODUCTION
Mutations at the homozygous status in the NBS1 gene
(known also as NBN) are responsible for a rare disease
known as Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS; OMIM
251260), an autosomic recessive disorder whose signs are a
distinct facial appearance, microcephaly, immunodeficiency,
chromosome rearrangements and sensitivity to ionising ra-
diation [1]. In NBS, a defective response to face DNA dam-
age is associated with chromosomal instability, and in turn
with a strong predisposition to develop malignancy, in par-
ticular lymphomas [2, 3]. The majority of them are non
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) (with a high incidence of dif-
fuse large B-cell lymphomas), lymphoblatic anaemia, and
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Among solid tumours, medul-
loblastoma has been observed in four patients [4], and rhab-
domiosarcoma of the perianal region in three others [5].
Since the latter is extremely uncommon among children, a
strong association with NBS has been suggested [5]. All the
11 disease-causing mutations so far identified in NBS1 gene
have been found within exons 6-10 (Fig. 1), and 8 of them
result in premature truncation of the NBS1 protein, with the
possible synthesis of NBS1 variants of lower molecular
weight [6].
As a measure of cancer incidence in NBS, the Polish reg-
istry report that 40% of patients suffering for NBS developed

lymphoma within the first two decades of life [3]. Though
NBS is a recessive disease and one would not expect any
cellular feature or clinical symptom, a growing number of
papers report higher spontaneous and induced chromosome
instability and an increased incidence of tumours among
NBS carriers. The FISH chromosome painting analysis re-
vealed that NBS carriers display a 3-fold higher rate of chro-
mosome translocations compared with non-carriers [7].
Furthermore, the same authors reported that after irradiation,
the response of cells from heterozygous carriers was inter-
mediate between that of NBS homozygous and normal indi-
viduals, and could be clearly differentiated from those of the
other groups in double-coded studies. Moreover, NBS het-
erozygosity can be distinguished from other genotypes by
the number of the long-lived stable aberrations in NBS cells
[8]. Radiation hypersensitivity in NBS carriers seems any-
how restricted to cells irradiated in the G1-phase, whereas the
number of chromatid-aberrations scored in G2-phase-treated
NBS heterozygous cells is in the range of normal cells or
slightly higher [9].
Nine mutations localized in the coding sequence of the
NBS1 gene have been found, at the heterozygous state, in
cancer patients (Fig. 1). The 657del5 (or founder mutation),
the 511A>G (I171V), the 643C>T (R215W), and the
742insGG mutations were found both in NBS patients and in
cancer patients. Four mutations have been found in cancer
patients only (278C>T, 381C>T, 448G>T, and 628G>T).
The 283G>A (D95N) mutation, has been identified both in
cancer patients and in healthy controls [10], but is not listed
as known NBS1 polymorphism by the NCBI website [11].

NBS1 MUTATIONS AND CANCER RISK
The first evidence of a possible correlation between
NBS1 carriers and cancer risk, came from family data stud-
ies, indicating that blood relatives of NBS patients with the
657del5 founder mutation had a high probability to develop
malignancy [12]. From 1998, several studies have exami-
nated the frequency of the NBS1 mutations in cancer pa-
tients. In Table 1, we have collected all the existing data rela-
tive to the frequency of cancer in heterozygotes for the
commonest NBS1 gene mutations, in particular the 657del5,
the R125W, the I171V, and the IVS11+2insT mutations. The
relative distribution of these mutations in NBS1 heterozy-
gous cancer patients is illustrated in Fig. (2).
The 657del5 Mutation
The 657del5 hypomorphic germ line mutation in exon 6
of NBS1 gene, accounts for more than 90% of all mutant
alleles in NBS. The highest frequency of heterozygous carri-
ers of the 657del5 mutation has been found in the Slavic
population of Central Europe, with an average frequency of
1/177 [13]. A total number of 81 carriers of 7474 cancer pa-
tients (1.8%), have been so far identified (Table 1).
The evidence of a strong correlation between 657del5
mutation heterozygous carriers and cancer risk, has been
strengthened by a large study on 344 blood relatives (first-
through fourth-degree) of NBS patients, in 24 different NBS
families of Czech Republic and Slovakia, from 1998 to 2003
[14]. Thirteen blood relatives developed malignancies of any
type, among them eleven were carriers of the 657del5 NBS1
mutation, compared with 6 expected. In this study, the most
frequently type of cancer observed was stomach and colorec-
tal cancer. Breast cancers were also reported, though at a
lower frequency [14].
The cancer risk of the 657del5 mutation carriers has been
also assessed in cancer patients with no NBS cases in the
family. It was found that carriers of the 657del5 mutation
were about twice more frequent among cancer patients than
among matched controls [15]. Most of the 657del5 carriers
were found among patients with melanoma (3.8%; OR:
6.376, p=0.0081), NHL (4.8%; OR: 8.05, p=0.0351), breast
cancer (1.8%; OR: 2.927, p=0.0795), and colorectal cancer
(1.3%; OR: 2.091, p=0.2197) [15]. Moreover, malignant
tumours among parents and siblings of 657del5 carriers were
twice more frequent (14/77) than in population control [15].
Interestingly, in a study on 2.400 healthy NBS1 heterozygous
Polish women, emerged a frequency of 96/10.603 (8.8%)
malignant tumours among parents and siblings. This sug-
gested that first-degree relatives of the 657del5 mutation
carriers may have an elevated risk of cancer [15]. Heterozy-
gotes for the 657del5 mutation are about three times more
frequent among non-selected breast cancer patients than ex-
pected. Since an elevated risk of breast cancer has been also
observed among carriers of mutations in the BRCA1, p53 and
ATM genes [16, 17], and because these gene products inter-
act with each other and with NBS1 [18], these findings sug-
gest that NBS1 is another gene that might be associated with
increased risk of breast cancer in heterozygotes [15].
The R215W Mutation
The R215W mutation has been considered for a long
time a polymorphism of NBS1, and only recently its severe
pathogenicity is emerged with the identification of com-
pound heterozygous 657del5/R215W NBS patients [19].
The R215W missense mutation was first described in a
case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and in 9
probands of Slavic origin from a population-based study
[10]. Subsequently, a high frequency of heterozygous carri-
ers of the R215W mutation was found not only among chil-
dren affected by ALL (2.1%), but also by HL (2.6%) (Table
1) [20].
The R215W mutation has been also detected among sev-
eral cancer patients, complexively in 34 of 4251 individuals
with tumours (0.85%) (Table 1). Several studies conducted
among Poland, Germany, Czech Republic and United King-
dom, report that heterozygous carriers of the R215W mis-
sense mutation have an increased risk of colorectal cancer
(1.3%), prostate cancer (1.6%), NHL (1.07%), and breast
cancer (0.6%) (Table 1) [15, 21-24].
The I171V Mutation
The 511A>G (I171V) germ-line mutation was identified
for the first time in 5 of 47 children with ALL [10]. These
children were all characterized by late prognoses due to a
late relapses [10]. The same mutation, at the homozygous
state, was detected in a Japanese patient with aplastic anae-
mia, but with no other clinical signs of NBS [25]. In a large

study aimed to assess the frequency of NBS1 mutations in
patients with larynx cancer and multiple primary tumours, is
emerged that the frequency of the I171V mutation carriers is
significantly higher than in population controls (2.3% in lar-
ynx cancer patients, p=0.0175; 5.4% in multiple primary
tumours, p=0.0005). These results imply that the I171V mu-
tation contributes significantly to the overall incidence of
larynx carcinoma [26].
An investigation in the Polish population has provided
evidences that the I171V mutation could be associated with
an increased breast cancer risk (1.8% of I171V carriers,
p=0.02) [27]. In particular, this association concerns patients
with breast cancer, whose first-degree relatives also had di-
agnosis of those malignancies [27]. However, in an associa-
tion study in two large hospital-based case-control settings
from Germany and Belarus, is emerged that the I171V mis-
sense mutation does not significantly increase the breast can-
cer risk (0.9% of I171V carriers, p=0.7) [24].
Very recently, it has been shown that the 2.58% of stud-
ied patients with malignancies are carriers of the I171V mu-
tation, compared to the 0.17% in the control group (p=0.00
02). The percentage of the mutation carriers is particularly
high among patients with neck and head tumours (6.17%,
p=0.0001), thus suggesting that the I171V mutation in NBS1
gene may be susceptibility factor in solid tumours [28].
The IVS11+2insT Mutation
The IVS11+2insT mutation has been described for the
first time in heterozygous Japanese subjects [29], with an
increased risk of gastrointestinal cancer that originate in the
stomach (2% of carriers, p<0.0001), and in the colorectum
(0.8% of carriers, p=0.02) [29]. Interestingly, even if there is
not a statistical significant correlation between carriers of the
IVS11+2insT mutation and development of lung cancer, it is
noteworthy that patients with this type of tumour and het-
erozygous for the IVS11+2insT mutation, are characterized
by a relatively early onset [29]. Since it has been suggested
the existence of a mendelian inheritance in the pathogenesis
of lung cancer [30, 31], it has been proposed the possibility
that the rare autosomal gene contributing to the early onset
of lung cancer may be NBS1 [29].
The IVS11+2insT mutation represent the first reported
example of a germ line mutation that strongly predisposes to
gastric cancer development in the Japanese population. Tak-
ing into account that each year 100.000 new case of gastric
cancer arises in Japan [32], it is possible to hypothesize that
heterozygous carriers of the IVS11+2insT mutation are sus-
ceptible to the development of gastric and colon carcinomas
[29].
BIOCHEMICAL EFFECTS OF THE NBS1 MUTA-
TION ON THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF
THE NBS1 PROTEIN
The NBS1 protein is part of a nuclear multi-protein com-
plex composed also by MRE11 and RAD50 (MRN com-
plex), which plays a crucial role in the response to DNA
double strand breaks (DSBs), a lesion generated by both en-
dogenous factors and environmental agents as ionising radia-
tions [33, 34]. NBS1 consists of 754 amino acids, has a mo-
lecular weight of 95kDa, and is composed by three regions:
the N-terminus, the central region, and the C-terminus (Fig.
3A). The N-terminal region contains a fork-head associated
(FHA) domain (amino acids 24-109) and two breast cancer
C-terminus (BRCT) domain (BRCT1: amino acids 114-183;
BRCT2: amino acids 221-291) [35-37]. The central region
contains several consensus sequences for phosphorylation by
ATM or ATR kinases [38-40]. The C-terminal region (amino
acids 665-693) contains a MRE11 binding domain [41], and
an ATM recruitment motif [42].
Low expression of abbreviated polypeptides of both N-
terminal and C-terminal NBS1 has been demonstrated in
NBS lymphoblastoid cell lines with different mutations. Par-
ticularly, C-terminal peptides of lower molecular weight than
95kDa, which maintain the ability to interact with MRE11,
has been detected by means of a co-immunoprecipitation
assay in lymphoblastoid NBS cell lines [6, 9]. NBS cells
characterised by the presence of the classical mutation
657del5 in the NBS1 gene, show two alternative forms of
NBS1 with a lower molecular weight, of approximately 26
and 70 kDa. In particular, the 5bp deletion in position 657
splits the BRCT tandem domain exactly in the linker region
that connects the two BRCT domains. The 26kDa protein
includes the region 1-218 of the NBS1 protein, and com-
prises the FHA and the first BRCT domains. The 70kDa
protein is produced by an alternative initiation of translation
upstream the 5bp deletion: after a 18 residue extension at the
N-terminus, the sequence is identical to that of the wild type
NBS1, from the amino acid 221 to the end, and contains the
second BRCT domain and the C-terminal half of NBS1
[37,43] (Fig. 3B).
The R215W missense mutation determines the substitu-
tion at position 215 of an arginine (R) with a tryptophan (W).
The 215 residue of NBS1 protein is located at the C-terminus
of the BRCT1 domain, right before the linker region which
connects the two BRCT domains, and seems to be pivotal for
the relative orientation of the NBS1 BRCT domains [44]
(Fig. 3C). Since tryptophan is a hydrophobic and bulky resi-
due, it could lead to a perturbation of the relative geometry
of the tandem BRCT domains. It has been demonstrated, in
fact, that the R215W mutation in NBS1 impairs histone -
H2AX binding after induction of DNA damage, leading to a
delay in DNA-DSB rejoining [44].
NBS1 Heterozygosity and Cancer Risk Current Genomics, 2008, Vol. 9, No. 4 279
The pathogenic character of the I171V mutation is pre-
sumably connected with its occurrence in the BRCT1 do-
main of NBS1 (Fig. 3D). So, similarly to the R215W muta-
tion, the I171V may perturb the proper geometry of the tan-
dem BRCT domain, thus impairing the binding to -H2AX
and the delocalization of the MRN complex to the vicinity of
the DNA damage site [26,45].
The IVS11+2insT mutation determines the lacking of the
MRE11- and ATM-binding domain at the C-terminus of the
NBS1 protein [29] (Fig. 3E). This determines the synthesis
of an 80kDa protein, defective in the interaction with
MRE11, MDC1, BRCA1 and ATM [29].
CONCLUSIONS
Epidemiological data so far collected point to an in-
creased risk of cancer incidence in heterozygous carriers of
the 657del5, R215W, I171V, and IVS11+2insT mutations of
the NBS1 gene.
The only NBS1 657del5 founder mutation frequency
among newborns is 1:154 in Czech Republic, 1:182 in
Ukraine (Lvov region), 1:190 in Poland, with a mean preva-
lence of 1:177 for the three populations tested [13], whereas
the NBS1 R215W mutation frequency among Czech new-
borns is 1:234 [46]. A moderately elevated risk in heterozy-
gous carriers would results in hundreds of new cancer cases
in these populations every year. Because it cannot be ex-
cluded that cancer patients who carry germ-line NBS1 muta-
tions may show a specific sensitivity to treatment with ionis-
ing radiation or cytostatic drugs, as recently shown [8], sys-
tematic studies are now under way to protocol their re-
sponses to radio- and chemotherapy.
Experimental support that NBS1 heterozygosity predis-
pose cells to malignancy, come from a study in which the
mouse homologue of the human NBS1 gene, Nbn, was dis-
rupted in mice [47]. Nbn+/-
mice showed a significantly in-
creased occurrence of spontaneous solid tumours (epithelial
tumours affecting the liver, prostate and mammary glands,
and gonad malignancy) in addition to lymphoma. Moreover,
ionising radiation dramatically increased cancer formation in
Nbn+/-
mice, especially thyroid tumours. These data provide
a clear relationship between NBS1 heterozygosity, radiation
sensitivity and increased cancer risk. Interestingly, examina-
tion of the tumours gave no evidence for loss or mutation of

the wild-type allele, suggesting that haploinsufficiency is the
presumed pathogenic mechanism. In contrast, for human
heterozygotes, the possible existence of a truncated protein
produced by alternative translation [6], and capable of inter-
action with MRE11 would be compatible with a dominant
negative mechanism.
